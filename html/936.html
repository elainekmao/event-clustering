<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 003858 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 5/25/08 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MNUC, IN, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: BENAZIR PROMISES MODERATION ON NUCLEAR TESTING </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAHORE 310 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY LAHORE PRINCIPAL OFFICER GEOFFREY R. PYATT, REASON </p><p>1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS LAHORE 315 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: MEETING MAY 25 WITH PRINCIPAL OFFICER, FORMER PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO SAID SHE WOULD NO LONGER PRESS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO TEST ITS NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.  THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A </p><p>TIME FOR A DETONATION, BENAZIR ARGUED, BUT AT THIS STAGE A TEST </p><p>WOULD BE COUNTER TO PAKISTAN\'S INTERESTS.  INSTEAD, SHE SAID, THE </p><p>PPP WILL REDIRECT ITS CRITICISM OF NAWAZ SHARIF TO FOCUS ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S "INDECISION" AND "MISMANAGEMENT."  BENAZIR ARGUED THAT </p><p>MAY 11 WAS A TURNING POINT IN PAKISTAN\'S HISTORY WHICH REQUIRES A </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL RETHINKING OF THE COUNTRY\'S SECURITY STRATEGY.  SHE </p><p>PREDICTED THAT NAWAZ MAY HAVE TO BE "SACRIFICED" IN ORDER TO HEAL </p><p>THE WOUNDED PRIDE OF PAKISTAN\'S MILITARY.  PRINCIPAL OFFICER </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT BENAZIR\'S BELLICOSE REACTION TO INDIA\'S TESTS HAD </p><p>DRAWN HARSH CRITICISM IN THE WEST AND SUGGESTED THAT THE PPP STATE </p><p>PUBLICLY THAT TESTING IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE USED AS A POLITICAL </p><p>FOOTBALL.  BENAZIR DISAVOWED HER WIDELY-REPRINTED OP-ED CALLING FOR </p><p>A PREEMPTIVE MILITARY STRIKE ON INDIA, CLAIMING THAT SHE INVOKED </p><p>THIS POSSIBILITY ONLY TO ILLUSTRATE THE RANGE OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE </p><p>-- NOT AS A RECOMMENDATION FOR ACTION.  ASKED ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN </p><p>THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE, SHE RECOMMENDED A COOLING-OFF PERIOD </p><p>FOLLOWED BY NEGOTIATIONS TO RATIFY THE CURRENT DIVISION OF KASHMIR. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PRINCIPAL OFFICER MET MAY 25 AT HER REQUEST WITH FORMER </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO, WHO WAS IN LAHORE FOR AN APPEARANCE </p><p>BEFORE THE HIGH COURT\'S ACCOUNTABILITY BENCH.  SHE WAS JOINED BY </p><p>PPP PROVINCIAL PRESIDENT RAO SIKANDER IQBAL AND COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>DIRECTOR QASIM ZIA.  THIS MEETING FOLLOWED SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS IN </p><p>WHICH PPP LEADERS HAVE CLAIMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED OUR ARGUMENTS IN </p><p>FAVOR OF RESTRAINT (REFTEL) AND TO HAVE CONVINCED BENAZIR TO SOFTEN </p><p>HER RHETORIC.  SENATE OPPOSITION LEADER AITZAZ AHSAN WENT SO FAR AS </p><p>TO CLAIM ON MAY 24 THAT BENAZIR HAD "TAKEN A U-TURN" AND OPENLY </p><p>OPPOSED NUCLEAR TESTING IN RECENT PPP LEADERSHIP MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>BACK FROM THE BRINK </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ASKED ABOUT PRESS REPORTS THAT SHE HAD URGED NATION-WIDE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN FAVOR OF TESTING, BENAZIR CLAIMED THAT NO ONE IN </p><p>THE PPP WOULD CALL FOR TESTING FROM NOW ON.  THE MOMENT HAS PASSED. </p><p>WE UNDERSTAND THAT A TEST NOW WOULD HAVE A DISASTROUS IMPACT ON </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S ECONOMY AND INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION.  I CANNOT SAY </p><p>THESE THINGS PUBLICLY, BENAZIR SAID, BUT NEITHER WILL I CALL FOR A </p><p>DETONATION.  AT THE OPPOSITION\'S MAY 21 HYDERABAD RALLY, SHE NOTED, </p><p>THE LINES THAT GOT THE MOST APPLAUSE WERE NOT TAHIR-UL-QADRI\'S CALL </p><p>FOR NUCLEAR TESTING, BUT HER OWN ATTACKS ON NAWAZ SHARIF\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND MANHOOD.  WHEN PRESSED ON THE PPP\'S POSTURE, BENAZIR </p><p>CONCEDED THAT EVEN IF SHE WANTED TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AGAINST </p><p>TESTING SHE COULD NOT, SINCE THIS WOULD BE ATTACKED BY OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  WE WERE DRIVEN INTO THIS </p><p>ALLIANCE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO DEAL WITH US A </p><p>LEGITIMATE OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT -- SO NOW WE MUST LIVE WITH THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MAY 11 WAS A TURNING POINT IN PAKISTAN\'S HISTORY, BENAZIR </p><p>SAID.  WE HAVE TO RETHINK HOW WE DEFINE OUR SECURITY AND HOW WE </p><p>LOOK AT INDIA.  ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES, BENAZIR CONTINUED, THE </p><p>MILITARY LEADERSHIP UNDERSTANDS THESE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES AND IS </p><p>IN NO HURRY TO TEST A NUCLEAR DEVICE.  HOWEVER, AT LOWER LEVELS OF </p><p>THE MILITARY THERE IS A FEELING OF WOUNDED PRIDE SIMILAR TO </p><p>SENTIMENTS AFTER THE 1971 LOSS OF BANGLADESH.  "I\'M AFRAID NAWAZ </p><p>MAY EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BE SACRIFICED TO HEAL THAT SENSE OF SHAME," </p><p>BENAZIR ADDED, "BUT IT\'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHO MIGHT TAKE HIS PLACE." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) EVEN IF I AM NOT CALLING FOR A NUCLEAR TEST, BENAZIR </p><p>SUGGESTED, NAWAZ SHARIF WILL REMAIN VULNERABLE TO CRITICISMS OF HIS </p><p>INDECISION IN THE FACE OF INDIA\'S AGGRESSION.  "NAWAZ IS TRYING TO </p><p>PUT HANDCUFFS ON ME," BENAZIR QUIPPED, "BUT I\'M GOING TO PUT </p><p>BANGLES ON HIM." (NOTE: BY SUGGESTING THAT NAWAZ WEARS BANGLES, AS </p><p>SHE DID IN HYDERABAD, BENAZIR IS QUESTIONING HIS MASCULINITY -- A </p><p>DEEP INSULT IN THIS SOCIETY.) </p><p> </p><p>SHIFTING THE DEBATE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IF THE PPP HAS DECIDED NUCLEAR TESTING WOULD BE AGAINST THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S BEST INTERESTS, PRINCIPAL OFFICER SUGGESTED, THEN IT </p><p>WOULD BE HELPFUL TO MAKE THIS POINT PUBLICLY.  SO FAR IN THIS </p><p>DEBATE, THE OPPOSITION HAS APPEARED TO BE MOTIVATED MORE BY </p><p>POLITICS THAN BY NATIONAL INTERESTS.  AT THE VERY LEAST, THE PPP </p><p>SHOULD SIGNAL TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE PARTY HAS DECIDED THIS </p><p>ISSUE IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE TREATED AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. </p><p>BENAZIR WAS INTRIGUED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND INSTRUCTED HER </p><p>COLLEAGUES TO FOLLOW-UP. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) PRINCIPAL OFFICER ALSO QUESTIONED BENAZIR ON HER MAY 17 LOS </p><p>ANGELES TIMES OP-ED, WHICH CONCLUDED BY DANGLING THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE ON INDIA IN RESPONSE TO THE TESTS.  BENAZIR </p><p>DISAVOWED THIS INTERPRETATION, CLAIMING THE PIECE WAS DRAFTED TO </p><p>ILLUSTRATE POSSIBLE RESPONSES, NOT AS A PRESCRIPTION FOR ACTION. </p><p>ACTUALLY, BENAZIR SAID, THE IDEA CAME FROM ROBERT MCNAMARA, WHO </p><p>SUGGESTED WHEN I WAS IN LONDON THAT A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE WOULD BE </p><p>ONE OPTION UNDER CONSIDERATION IF THE UNITED STATES WAS FACED WITH </p><p>A SIMILAR THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ASKED ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE, BENAZIR </p><p>SUGGESTED THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A COOLING OFF PERIOD OF SEVERAL </p><p>MONTHS, AFTER WHICH NEGOTIATIONS COULD BEGIN TO MAKE THE LINE OF </p><p>CONTROL A PERMANENT BORDER.  GIVEN THE NEW STRATEGIC REALITIES, </p><p>DIVIDING KASHMIR WOULD SEEM TO BE THE ONLY OPTION.  SHE ASSUMED </p><p>THAT WESTERN SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN\'S NUCLEAR RESTRAINT WOULD </p><p>EVENTUALLY BE FOLLOWED BY PRESSURE TO COME CLEAN AND ADHERE TO THE </p><p>CTBT AND NPT.  PRINCIPAL OFFICER REPLIED THAT DECISIONS ON NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY WILL HAVE TO BE ANSWERED BY THE PAKISTANIS, NOT BY OUTSIDE </p><p>POWERS.  WE HOPE THE DEBATE OVER PAKISTAN\'S SECURITY WILL INCLUDE </p><p>THE WIDEST POSSIBLE SWATH OF POLITICAL OPINION, BUT THAT DEPENDS ON </p><p>A MORE CIVILIZED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PML AND PPP. </p><p> </p><p>9 COMMENT: BENAZIR REMAINS FIRMLY FOCUSED ON THE GOAL OF DRIVING </p><p>NAWAZ SHARIF FROM OFFICE, AND IT WOULD BE OUT OF CHARACTER FOR HER </p><p>TO PASS UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO EAT AWAY AT HIS PUBLIC BASE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>UNLIKE MOST IN THE OPPOSITION, SHE UNDERSTANDS THE LASTING DAMAGE </p><p>THAT WOULD BE DONE BY A NUCLEAR TEST, AND APPEARS GENUINE IN HER </p><p>VIEW THAT PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT NOW TEST.  CRITICISM FROM HER MORE </p><p>COURAGEOUS PARTY COLLEAGUES AND ADVISERS IN THE U.S. MAY ALSO HAVE </p><p>HELPED TO MODERATE HER OPINION.  THIS SHIFT MAY BUY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>A LITTLE MANEUVERING ROOM, BUT NOT MUCH.  INDEED, BENAZIR\'S NEW </p><p>TACTIC OF QUESTIONING NAWAZ\' MANHOOD MAY PROVE A POWERFUL CATALYST </p><p>TOWARDS THE NUCLEAR TEST THAT SHE NOW CLAIMS TO OPPOSE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMONS </p><p></p></div>
