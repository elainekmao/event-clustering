(SBU) SUMMARY.  In an introductory call on the new </p><p>Minister of Environment, Dr. Hisham Gharaibeh, the </p><p>Ambassador gave his assurances that the U.S. would continue </p><p>to support Jordan\'s environmental objectives.  Among these, </p><p>both agreed that building the country\'s environmental </p><p>management capacity and supporting projects and activities </p><p>that would enhance the new ministry\'s regulatory and </p><p>enforcement capabilities rank highly.  The Ambassador urged </p><p>Gharaibeh to focus with the Minister of Industry and Trade </p><p>on the timing and agenda of the proposed Joint Environmental </p><p>Forum.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In an August 5 courtesy call on the new Minister of </p><p>Environment, Dr. Hisham Gharaibeh, the Ambassador </p><p>acknowledged the challenges that lay ahead for Jordan to </p><p>protect its environment.  He reassured Gharaibeh that the </p><p>U.S. would continue its active engagement on environmental </p><p>issues, including funding not only the larger infrastructure </p><p>projects, such as water and wastewater treatment plants, but </p><p>also smaller technical assistance and training activities. </p><p>Gharaibeh was grateful for the ongoing U.S. support, but </p><p>repeatedly raised Jordan\'s desire for additional assistance </p><p>in this sector.  "We\'ll count on you," he said.  The </p><p>minister added that one of the greatest challenges he faces </p><p>will be to carve out the new ministry\'s domain and </p><p>relationship with potentially competing ministries, such as </p><p>Water and Irrigation, Health, and Agriculture. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Turning to the Joint Environmental Forum, the </p><p>Ambassador explained the background of this FTA commitment </p><p>to Gharaibeh and encouraged him to coordinate closely with </p><p>the new Minister of Industry and Trade, Mohammad Abu </p><p>Hammour, to identify an appropriate time and develop the </p><p>agenda for the event.  Gharaibeh, thinking aloud, suggested </p><p>that October may represent an opportunity to host the event, </p><p>but promised to check with his Industry and Trade </p><p>counterpart to reconfirm.  The Ambassador impressed upon the </p><p>minister the importance of this bilateral environmental </p><p>dialog, noting that the Jordan FTA was the fist such </p><p>agreement to introduce an environmental element and </p><p>Washington policymakers were keen to follow its progress. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The USAID Acting Mission Director and Water </p><p>Resources and Environment Officer briefed Gharaibeh on </p><p>environmental projects that USAID is supporting in Jordan. </p><p>Notable among these are medical waste management, hazardous </p><p>waste management, reclaimed water reuse in agricultural and </p><p>industrial applications, rehabilitation of a phosphate mine, </p><p>and broad public awareness campaigns.  The NEA Regional </p><p>Environment Officer added that an upcoming EPA-facilitated </p><p>multilateral (Jordanian, Palestinian, and Israeli) training </p><p>activity on hazardous waste management complements USAID\'s </p><p>objective and helps to build the capacity of his ministry\'s </p><p>personnel.  Gharaibeh was appreciative of the U.S. </p><p>assistance on hazardous waste and lamented the state of the </p><p>Suwaqa hazardous waste site, a quasi-white elephant of a </p><p>facility in the remote Jordan desert.  While some of the </p><p>basic infrastructure is in place, he related, Suwaqa </p><p>requires significant capital investment (including the </p><p>incinerators) and a management plan to make it operational. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) When asked about his priorities for the Ministry of </p><p>Environment, Gharaibeh told us he would be aggressively </p><p>seeking international donor funding, as his budget is quite </p><p>small.  Recognizing his limited resources, he hopes to </p><p>create public/private partnerships to work on pressing </p><p>environmental issues.  Developing better working </p><p>relationships with complementary ministries, such as Health, </p><p>Water and Irrigation, and Agriculture, are also high on his </p><p>agenda.  Gharaibeh noted that for years, without an </p><p>environmental entity of cabinet status, other ministries had </p><p>"poached" many of the issues that "rightfully belong" to the </p><p>Ministry of Environment and he needed to better define the </p><p>new lines of responsibility.  The laws are clear, he said, </p><p>but enforcement and implementation are weak. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Ambassador told Gharaibeh that we hoped to </p><p>recruit an EPA official to come to Jordan for several months </p><p>to assist the Ministry of Environment in developing the most </p><p>efficient and effective organizational structure to confront </p><p>the environmental issues particular to Jordan.  Gharaibeh </p><p>noted that the proposed organizational structure assessment </p><p>may need a specialized contractor to be able to do a </p><p>thorough and in-depth job. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON HISHAM GHARAIBEH.  Until </p><p>his appointment as Minister of Environment at the end of </p><p>July, Dr. Hisham Gharaibeh served as Vice President of </p><p>Yarmouk University, Jordan, since 2000.  Prior to that he </p><p>was a professor at the Department of Finance and Banking at </p><p>Yarmouk University from 1979-2000.  Gharaibeh has also </p><p>worked as the Head of the Consultancy Department at the Arab </p><p>Organization for Administrative Development (League of Arab </p><p>States) from 1987-1991, in addition to doing consulting for </p><p>several Arab and international organizations, such as the </p><p>IMF.  While his experience in matters of environmental </p><p>affairs is arguably limited, his extensive managerial </p><p>background may help the nascent ministry to develop the </p><p>proper infrastructure and recruit the most qualified </p><p>personnel.  Gharaibeh was born in Irbid in 1948.  He holds a </p><p>BSc in Commerce from the University of Alexandria, Egypt, an </p><p>MBA from the University of Dallas, Texas, and a PhD in </p><p>Financial Management from the University of Texas.  He was a </p><p>teaching assistant at the University of Texas from 1975- </p><p>1979. </p><p> </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
