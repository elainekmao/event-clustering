<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOGADISHU 03643 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, LY, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOMALI ATTITUDE ON LIBYA </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON APRIL 1 MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY ADAN MET WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR BRIDGES AT THE REQUEST OF PRESIDENT SIAD </p><p>TO PRESENT SOMALI VIEWS ON THE RECENT U.S.-LIBYAN </p><p>HOSTILITIES IN THE GULF OF SIDRA.  AMBASSADOR NUR, </p><p>STILL VISITING FROM WASHINGTON, AMERICAS DIRECTOR ELMI </p><p>AND DCM WERE ALSO PRESENT.  ADAN SAID THAT SOMALIA </p><p>HAD JOINED THE COLLECTIVE ARAB LEAGUE POSITION ADOPTED </p><p>AT TUNIS WHICH VIEWED U.S. MILITARY ACTION AGAINST LIBYA </p><p>AS EXCESSIVE.  THE SOMALI GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAD </p><p>REJECTED LIBYA\'S REQUEST FOR A SEPARATE SOMALI STATE- </p><p>MENT CRITICAL OF THE U.S. TO BE ISSUED IN MOGADISHU. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE MFA HAD INFORMED THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S </p><p>BUREAU THAT THE SOMALI GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT COUNTENANCE </p><p>ANY RETALIATION AGAINST U.S. PERSONNEL OR FACILITIES IN </p><p>SOMALIA.  THE LIBYANS WERE ASKED TO GIVE THEIR </p><p>ASSURANCE THAT NO HOSTILE ACTION WILL BE TAKEN AGAINST </p><p>THE U.S. AND TO CONVEY THIS REQUEST TO TRIPOLI.  ADAN </p><p>SAID THAT THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAU HAD NOW PROVIDED </p><p>THESE ASSURANCES TO THE MFA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BRIDGES ASKED ADAN TO CONVEY TO PRESIDENT SIAD OUR </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT OVER THE ARAB LEAGUE RESOLUTION, BUT </p><p>ALSO HIS APPRECIATION FOR THE SOMALI DECISION NOT TO </p><p>ISSUE A SEPARATE STATEMENT AND FOR THE MFA DEMARCHE </p><p>TO THE LIBYANS REGARDING RETALIATION.  WE APPRECIATED </p><p>THE EXCELLENT COOPERATION OF THE SOMALI SECURITY </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN KEEPING CLOSE WATCH ON LIBYAN PERSONNEL </p><p>IN SOMALIA.  BRIDGES SAID HE BELIEVED THAT WE AND </p><p>THE SOMALI AUTHORITIES FULLY AGREED THAT QADHAFI COULD </p><p>NOT BE TRUSTED.  WE WOULD THEREFORE LOOK TO CONTINUED </p><p>CLOSE COOPERATION WITH SOMALI OFFICIALS ON THIS </p><p>PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ADAN SUGGESTED THAT SOME COUNTRIES WERE TENDING </p><p>TO LOOK AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE GULF OF SIDRA AS A </p><p>CASE OF A POWERFUL COUNTRY TAKING A FORCEFUL STANCE </p><p>AGAINST A SMALLER AND WEAKER ONE.  BRIDGES SAID THAT </p><p>WHILE UNDOUBTEDLY THE UNITED STATES WAS LARGER </p><p>AND MORE POWERFUL THAN LIBYA, OUR ACTION WAS MOTIVATED </p><p>BY OUR STRONG INTEREST IN MAINTAINING THE FREEDOM </p><p>OF THE SEAS IN THE FACE OF ANY COUNTRY\'S ILLEGAL </p><p>CLAIMS, LARGE OR SMALL.  BRIDGES REMINDED ADAN THAT WE </p><p>HAD REACTED ONLY AFTER THE LIBYANS HAD FIRED SIX </p><p>MISSILES AT OUR FORCES IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS OVER </p><p>A PERIOD OF SEVERAL HOURS.  WHILE THE GULF OF SIDRA </p><p>EXERCISES HAD ENDED, WE WERE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT </p><p>LIBYA MIGHT SEEK TO ATTACK OUR PEOPLE OR FACILITIES </p><p>ELSEWHERE.  THE PROBLEM WAS COMPLICATED BY THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT THE LIBYANS WOULD EMPLOY OTHERS, </p><p>INCLUDING CONCEIVABLY SOMALIS, TO DO THEIR DIRTY WORK. </p><p>AGAIN, WE WERE ANXIOUS TO STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH </p><p>THE SOMALI AUTHORITIES ON THIS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  AT THE END OF THE MEETING ADAN NOTED THAT HE </p><p>WOULD BE GOING TO DJIBOUTI FROM APRIL 2 THROUGH 6 TO </p><p>ATTEND THE NEXT IGAAD (EAST AFRICA DROUGHT) MEETING, </p><p>WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS ROUTINE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIDGES </p><p></p></div>
