<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001908 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SOUTH ASIA BUREAU DAS CAMP FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, PREL, PTER, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR DAS CAMP\'S VISIT TO SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador E. Ashley Wills, Reasons: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) I want to extend a warm welcome to you on your </p><p>upcoming visit to Sri Lanka.  Your visit comes at an </p><p>exciting time, with many of the positive trends we </p><p>are now observing having gained increased traction </p><p>since your December 2001 visit.  A ceasefire has been in </p><p>place since December, and the government and the Tamil Tigers </p><p>just sat down for constructive face-to-face talks, which are </p><p>due to continue later this year.  The situation </p><p>remains fluid, however, with the intentions of the Tamil </p><p>Tigers still unclear.  The peace process could also be </p><p>undermined by domestic fissures, such as cohabitation </p><p>stresses between the PM and the President, and tensions </p><p>between the Muslim community and the LTTE.  The </p><p>government is also dealing with a delicate economic </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) This period of tremendous opportunity and </p><p>volatility in Sri Lanka is also a time of significant </p><p>U.S. influence.  Prime Minister Wickremesinghe wants to </p><p>work closely with the U.S.  Your visit will help cement </p><p>the gains made in U.S.-Sri Lankan relations by </p><p>underscoring our strong support for the peace process, </p><p>reinforcing the same message delivered here by A/S Rocca in </p><p>March and the Deputy Secretary in August. </p><p>END EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Status of the Peace Process </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The election of a new government in </p><p>December 2001 heralded in an exciting -- and potentially </p><p>momentous -- period in Sri Lanka.  During your December 2001 </p><p>visit you saw Sri Lanka in the immediate aftermath of these </p><p>tumultuous elections; now you will observe first-hand the </p><p>many positive changes those elections sparked.  The United </p><p>National Front (UNF) government headed by Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe has taken an activist posture, </p><p>particularly regarding the peace process.  In short </p><p>order, the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) re-initiated the stalled Norwegian </p><p>government facilitation effort and put unilateral </p><p>ceasefires into effect in December 2001.  The government </p><p>also took rapid steps to ease tensions by lifting </p><p>roadblocks and checkpoints, and ending bans on medicine </p><p>and other items entering LTTE-controlled territories. </p><p>The government\'s performance on human rights issues has </p><p>also been a strong one, with many fewer Tamils </p><p>complaining of mistreatment at the hands of the security </p><p>forces.  (Note:  There is still an appearance of </p><p>impunity in some cases that the GSL needs to do more to </p><p>grapple with, however.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Continuing the positive trend, the GSL and the </p><p>LTTE went on to conclude a formal ceasefire accord in </p><p>February.  The accord is being monitored by the </p><p>Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), which </p><p>has performed capably, but is thin on the ground.  In a </p><p>benchmark event, the two sides met face-to-face in </p><p>Thailand, September 16-18.  Before the talks took place, </p><p>the GSL met the long-standing demand of the LTTE and </p><p>lifted its ban on the organization, effectively </p><p>legalizing the LTTE as a political entity in Sri Lanka. </p><p>The talks -- though preliminary -- were constructive, </p><p>and set the stage for further talks slated to take place </p><p>later this year.  In a press conference held at the end </p><p>of the talks, the chief LTTE negotiator also made </p><p>remarks that seem to have edged away from an outright </p><p>demand for a separate state for Tamils.  In a very </p><p>recent development, the two sides also exchanged </p><p>prisoners for the first time since the war began. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) All of these steps have had a dramatic effect in </p><p>decreasing tensions in the country, bringing relief to a </p><p>war weary populace.  Already, the ongoing ceasefire is </p><p>the longest break that Sri Lankans have had from the </p><p>ethnic conflict since it began in 1983.  This new spirit </p><p>was symbolized by PM Wickremesinghe\'s visit to Jaffna in </p><p>March, the first such visit by a GSL leader in years. </p><p>A/S Rocca joined Wickeremesinghe for </p><p>part of this visit, underscoring U.S. support for the </p><p>peace process.  A/S Rocca\'s visit also led to the </p><p>arrival of a demining team sponsored by the U.S., which </p><p>has been clearing mines in Jaffna since April.  The </p><p>Deputy Secretary also made a highly successful visit to </p><p>war-ravaged Jaffna during his August visit to Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>LTTE Intentions not clear </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Despite so much progress in so short a time, GSL </p><p>interlocutors will be the first to tell you that the </p><p>situation is fluid.  One key reason for this is lack of </p><p>confidence in the LTTE (which has been listed on our </p><p>Foreign Terrorist Organization list since 1997).  While </p><p>it is clear that the LTTE is worried about further </p><p>international isolation in the aftermath of September 11 </p><p>(there are indications that intensified international </p><p>pressure has decreased its funding, for example), it is </p><p>not clear whether the organization is simply looking for </p><p>a hiatus to wait out the storm.  Some of the LTTE\'s </p><p>activities raise questions about its commitment to </p><p>peace, including forced recruitment for its military </p><p>(some of it of children), the widespread extortion of </p><p>money from Tamils and Muslims, and a pattern of low- </p><p>level harassment of the Sri Lankan military.  The LTTE </p><p>also remains authoritarian in structure and has not </p><p>renounced terrorism (although there have been no </p><p>reported LTTE-sponsored terrorist attacks this year). </p><p>With full knowledge of these risks, the GSL has made the </p><p>decision that it wants to test the LTTE to determine </p><p>whether it is for real and, so far, this policy is </p><p>generating favorable results. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Cohabitation Stresses and Muslim issues </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Another factor that could unravel the peace </p><p>process is domestic opposition in the south.  The </p><p>radical, Sinhalese chauvinist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) party has engaged in rallies and demonstrations </p><p>against the ceasefire accord.  A potentially more </p><p>ominous threat is President Kumaratunga and her party, </p><p>who have sent mixed signals, at times constructive, at </p><p>times critical.  Kumaratunga\'s attitude seems largely </p><p>bound up in the cohabitation tensions that flare between </p><p>her and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe\'s government.  We </p><p>recently heard that the PM and the president plan to </p><p>meet regularly to discuss peace process and national </p><p>security issues, which is a positive development. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Muslim community and the LTTE also share a </p><p>tense relationship.  The two sides have long been at </p><p>loggerheads, particularly in the ethnically mixed </p><p>Eastern Province.  Based on first-hand observation by </p><p>Mission personnel and other reports, some Muslims are so </p><p>angered at efforts by the LTTE to marginalize their </p><p>community that the possible growth of Islamic extremism </p><p>needs to be closely monitored.   Taken together, all of </p><p>these tensions are not positive for the peace process, </p><p>especially during this sensitive period when the </p><p>negotiation track with the LTTE is just starting up. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Economic Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Turning briefly to economic issues, Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>situation is delicate.  While it has the most open </p><p>economy in South Asia and a relatively high per capita </p><p>income (USD 837), economic growth has been uneven and is </p><p>mostly confined to the greater Colombo region.  A litany </p><p>of problems in 2001 conspired to produce the country\'s </p><p>first year of GDP contraction since independence (minus </p><p>1.4 percent).  The new UNF government appears committed </p><p>to putting the right policies in place to re-ignite </p><p>economic growth.  The main test of this commitment came </p><p>in its 2002 budget, presented in March.  This budget </p><p>contained many substantive reform measures and was key </p><p>to restarting the suspended payments of the IMF\'s </p><p>Standby Arrangement.  The government is now implementing </p><p>many of these reforms, while trying to minimize the </p><p>burden of increased prices on the population.  We expect </p><p>2002 to be a rebuilding year, with growth of 2-3 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Our trade relationship with Sri Lanka entered </p><p>a new phase with the signing of a bilateral Trade and </p><p>Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in July.  The TIFA </p><p>sets up a council, jointly chaired by USTR and the Sri </p><p>Lankan Ministry of Commerce, to discuss trade and </p><p>investment issues.  The first council meeting is to take </p><p>place in November with the visit to Sri Lanka of Deputy </p><p>USTR Ambassador Huntsman.  The U.S. intends to use the </p><p>TIFA process to improve the investment climate in Sri </p><p>Lanka and win greater business here for American firms. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) This exciting period in Sri Lanka provides many </p><p>opportunities for the U.S.  Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe wants to work closely with the U.S.  Per </p><p>the recent policy review, various USG agencies are in </p><p>the process of visiting Sri Lanka to review economic and </p><p>commercial issues, and study the possible return of the </p><p>Peace Corps, in addition to visits focused on enhanced </p><p>defense cooperation.  Your visit will demonstrate the </p><p>continued high-level U.S. interest in assisting Sri Lanka in </p><p>its quest for lasting peace and increased prosperity. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) We suggest that you make the following key </p><p>points in your meetings with Sri Lankan officials: </p><p> </p><p>-- Express strong U.S. support for the peace process and </p><p>Norwegian facilitation. </p><p> </p><p>-- GSL needs to keep up momentum;  Sri Lanka is a vital </p><p>symbol of movement toward peace and stability in a </p><p>troubled South Asian region. </p><p> </p><p>-- All parties should work in national interest on peace </p><p>process and on economic reform.  It is important that </p><p>peace process not falter because of political </p><p>infighting. </p><p> </p><p>-- Making the tough choices now on economic reform will set </p><p>the stage for growth throughout the decade; failing to do so </p><p>will ensure anemic growth and threaten the peace dividend Sri </p><p>Lankans are hoping for. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
