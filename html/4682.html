(U) CLASSIFIED BY CG EMI YAMAUCHI; REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY.  CONSUL GENERAL AND POLOFF RECENTLY MET </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02951  01 OF 02  120440Z </p><p>WITH FATHER TOAN, FATHER SUPERIOR OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS, </p><p>TO DISCUSS HIS VIEWS ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH IN VIETNAM.  HIS COMMENTS ON COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>GVN CONFIRMED WHAT POST HAS UNDERSTOOD FOR SOME TIME: THAT </p><p>A DELIBERATE, NON-CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH HAS LED TO </p><p>GREATER FREEDOMS FOR THE CHURCH AND ITS FOLLOWERS.  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, HE DID NOT DISCOUNT THE SERIOUS CHALLENGES </p><p>REMAINING.  HIS THOUGHTFUL OBSERVATIONS ON FATHER LY </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT A LESS THAN EXEMPLARY PERSONAL AND </p><p>PROFESSIONAL RECORD AS A PRIEST HAD MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>THE CATHOLIC LEADERSHIP TO SUPPORT HIS CAUSE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FATHER TOAN -- WHO SPEAKS EXCELLENT ENGLISH - WAS </p><p>THE ONLY OTHER CHURCH OFFICIAL PRESENT DURING A COURTESY </p><p>CALL ON HO CHI MINH CITY (HCMC) ARCHBISHOP MAN IN OCTOBER. </p><p>A SMALL DINNER ORGANIZED BY A LOCAL BUSINESSMAN WAS THE </p><p>OCCASION FOR A MORE INFORMAL DISCUSSION ON MATTERS </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR.  FATHER TOAN IS A SELF-DESCRIBED "B- </p><p>54", A NORTHERN CATHOLIC WHO CAME SOUTH DURING THE 1954 </p><p>PARTITION OF VIETNAM.  AS FATHER SUPERIOR, HE IS NOT ONLY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THE JESUIT ORDER, BUT ALSO </p><p>PERSONALLY DRAFTS MUCH OF THE ARCHBISHOP\'S PUBLIC AND </p><p>PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE.  HOWEVER, HE WOULD ONLY GO SO FAR </p><p>AS TO CONFIRM THAT HE "UNDERSTOOD" THERE HAD BEEN A LETTER </p><p>FROM THE COUNCIL OF BISHOPS TO THE GVN REGARDING HARSH </p><p>TREATMENT OF UNREGISTERED PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCHES IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND NORTHWEST VIETNAM.  HE WOULD NOT BE </p><p>DRAWN IN TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS BETTER TO </p><p>REGISTER WITH THE GVN OR NOT, BUT NOTED THAT THE </p><p>PROTESTANTS WERE HAVING A MORE DIFFICULT TIME IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS THAN THE CATHOLICS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02951  01 OF 02  120440Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) FATHER TOAN HIMSELF SPENT NINE YEARS IN PRISON </p><p>DURING THE 1980S AND EARLY 1990S FOR ACTIVITIES THE GVN </p><p>VIEWED AS ASSERTING THE INDEPENDENCE AND SPIRITUAL </p><p>SUPREMACY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN VIETNAM.  WHILE HIS </p><p>TREATMENT ALTERNATED BETWEEN HUMANE AND HARSH, HE BELIEVED </p><p>HE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT GVN "PSYCHOLOGY" DURING THE </p><p>INTERROGATIONS.  IN FATHER TOAN\'S OPINION, HIS GUARDS SPOKE </p><p>MORE CANDIDLY WITH HIM IN PRISON.  IN FACT, HE SAID THAT </p><p>ONE GUARD, WHO HAD OFTEN ASKED HIM FOR PERSONAL ADVICE, </p><p>YEARS LATER WROTE HIM A LETTER FROM HIS DEATHBED.  THE </p><p>PERSON TO WHOM THE LETTER WAS ENTRUSTED SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>DESTROYED THE LETTER WITHOUT DELIVERING IT TO FATHER TOAN. </p><p>THIS SECOND INDIVIDUAL LATER CONTACTED FATHER TOAN TO </p><p>APOLOGIZE, BUT SAID HE WAS AFRAID OF WHAT THE LETTER </p><p>CONTAINED.  WHILE HE WOULD/COULD NOT TELL HIM ITS CONTENTS. </p><p>FATHER TOAN BELIEVED THE LETTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE GUARD </p><p>HIMSELF HAD BEEN A SILENT BELIEVER ALL THOSE YEARS AND </p><p>WANTED FORGIVENESS IN THE END. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) FATHER TOAN NOTED THAT HE CAME TO SAIGON FROM NHA </p><p>TRANG SHORTLY BEFORE THE CITY FELL TO COMMUNIST FORCES IN </p><p>APRIL 1975, JUST IN TIME TO WORK AS AN ASSISTANT TO THE </p><p>RECENTLY DECEASED CARDINAL THUAN (SEE REFTEL).  WHEN ASKED </p><p>ABOUT ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUNERAL MASS HELD ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>20 IN NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL IN CENTRAL HCMC, HE CONFIRMED </p><p>THAT THE LARGE CROWD HAD ASSEMBLED SIMPLY BY WORD OF MOUTH </p><p>AND BY THE BANNER HANGING OVER THE CHURCH\'S ARCHWAY.  HE </p><p>FURTHER RELATED THAT THE ARCHBISHOP HAD BEEN IN CONTACT </p><p>WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES ABOUT A PUBLIC MEMORIAL SERVICE LONG </p><p>BEFORE THE CARDINAL\'S DEATH.  FATHER TOAN ATTRIBUTED THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02951  01 OF 02  120440Z </p><p>CHURCH\'S ABILITY TO HOST AN OPENLY EMOTIONAL MASS FOR A </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL PRIEST WHO HAD NEVER RETURNED TO VIETNAM </p><p>AFTER LEAVING THE COUNTRY IN 1991, TO ITS COOPERATIVE, "NO </p><p>SURPRISES" APPROACH TO THE GVN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  FATHER TOAN REMEMBERED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GVN </p><p>AND THE CHURCH IN THE YEARS IMMEDIATELY AFTER REUNIFICATION </p><p>AS INITIALLY CORDIAL.  THOSE RELATIONS DRAMATICALLY </p><p>WORSENED IN THE EARLY 1980S, WHEN THE GVN BEGAN TO FEAR </p><p>ROME\'S INFLUENCE -- PARTICULARLY THAT OF THE JESUITS.  THEN </p><p>CAME FATHER TOAN\'S NINE YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT.  EMERGING </p><p>FROM PRISON IN THE EARLY 1990S, HE RESUMED HIS DUTIES WITH </p><p>THE ORDER, ALTHOUGH IN A MUCH LESS VISIBLE MANNER.  HE HAD </p><p>TO WORK HIS WAY UP THE RANKS AGAIN.  AFFIRMING WHAT OTHER </p><p>CHURCH LEADERS HAVE SAID BEFORE, FATHER TOAN ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT LOW-KEY, COOPERATIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE GVN HAD BEEN </p><p>MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN CONFRONTATION.  HE GENERALLY FOUND </p><p>PARTY LEADERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LESS STRIDENT WHEN </p><p>HE CALLED ON THEM AT HOME, RATHER THAN IN THEIR OFFICES. </p><p>HE BELIEVED THEY WERE WILLING TO MAKE REASONABLE </p><p>ACCOMMODATIONS, AS LONG AS THE CHURCH DID NOT PUBLICLY </p><p>BOAST OF THEM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN THIS WAY, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAD BEEN ABLE TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8516 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02951  02 OF 02  120440Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    OIGO-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------166C73  120440Z /38 </p><p>R 120402Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8322 </p><p>INFO ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002951 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAKE NOTICEABLE STRIDES OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS.  ONE MAJOR </p><p>CHANGE WAS THE ABILITY OF PRIESTS TO TRAVEL FREELY OUTSIDE </p><p>VIETNAM.  INSTEAD OF ASKING FOR PERMISSION, AS WAS REQUIRED </p><p>IN THE PAST, PRIESTS TODAY ONLY NEEDED TO NOTIFY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF THEIR TRAVEL PLANS.  FATHER TOAN HAS TRAVELED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02951  02 OF 02  120440Z </p><p>EXTENSIVELY IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA SINCE HIS RELEASE. </p><p>HE ALSO NOTED THE GOVERNMENT\'S WILLINGNESS TO TURN A BLIND </p><p>EYE TO THE TRAINING AND ASSIGNMENT OF NUNS.  ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>DID NOT USE THE WORD "SEXIST," HE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS WAS </p><p>BECAUSE THE GVN FOUND "WOMEN LESS THREATENING THAN MEN IN </p><p>TERMS OF HAVING A POLITICAL AGENDA OR STRENGTH." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) DESPITE THE PROGRESS MADE SO FAR, FATHER TOAN NOTED </p><p>SERIOUS LIMITATIONS ON THE CHURCH\'S ABILITY TO TRAIN </p><p>ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF SEMINARIANS AND ORDAIN THEM AS PRIESTS. </p><p>HE EXPRESSED DOUBT THAT THE LONG-AWAITED SEVENTH SEMINARY - </p><p>- TO BE LOCATED IN NEIGHBORING DONG NAI PROVINCE -- WOULD </p><p>BE ALLOWED TO OPEN IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  HE BELIEVED </p><p>THE GREATEST CHALLENGE STILL FACING THE CHURCH WAS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CONTINUING FEAR OF A SPIRITUAL RIVAL TO THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ASKED FOR HIS OPINION OF FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY, </p><p>SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ANTI-GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACTIVITIES, FATHER TOAN AGAIN CONFIRMED WHAT OTHER SOURCES </p><p>HAVE SAID BEFORE.  WHILE HE INITIALLY HEDGED HIS ANSWER BY </p><p>NOTING THAT HE SPENT LITTLE TIME IN HUE AND HAD NOT COME </p><p>INTO CONTACT WITH HIM OFTEN, HE EVENTUALLY ADMITTED THAT </p><p>FATHER LY WAS NOT WELL RESPECTED BY OTHERS IN THE CHURCH. </p><p>FATHER TOAN ALSO CRITICIZED FATHER LY FOR GETTING INVOLVED </p><p>IN CONTROVERSIAL ACTIVITIES WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS </p><p>BISHOP.  THIS, HE BELIEVED, WAS THE MAJOR REASON THE CHURCH </p><p>HAD NOT UNITED MORE FORCEFULLY BEHIND HIM. </p><p> </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02951  02 OF 02  120440Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p></div>
