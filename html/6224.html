<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000396 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PAB SA/RA (FOR SCENSNY) </p><p>SA/PD LJIRWIN, WREINCKENS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA PLAY: IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Independent English weekly lay out "repercussions to the </p><p>economies in this and many other parts of the world" </p><p> </p><p>On 3/9 an editorial in the SUNDAY TIMES (independent </p><p>English weekly), "Gulf War and US," described the negative </p><p>effects of another Gulf war on the Sri Lankan economy.  The </p><p>editorial follows: </p><p> </p><p>The first blow will be to our tea market, with tea exports </p><p>poised to take a big drop in view of the fact that West </p><p>Asia is our largest regional market, next to the CIS </p><p>countries.  Remittances from migrant workers and of course </p><p>tourist arrivals are also bound to take a dip.  There will </p><p>be still other rollover repercussions, such as </p><p>repercussions to the garment industry as a result of the </p><p>United States and European Union economies slowing down due </p><p>to the probable effects of the war. </p><p> </p><p>There can also be other jolts to the Richter.  A Gulf War </p><p>could lead to the downward revision of corporate earnings, </p><p>even though most companies quoted on the markets are </p><p>reporting good results these days.  These residual fears </p><p>have in fact already affected the stock market, and brought </p><p>down share prices in Colombo as of last week. </p><p> </p><p>Projections will go awry, and a good example is Asia </p><p>Securities.  The estimated earnings of Asia Securities </p><p>would be cut by around 25 per cent for financial year 2004, </p><p>wiping out the 18 per cent forecasted profit growth.  This </p><p>setback is as a result of weaker domestic and export </p><p>markets, to which should also be added higher costs of </p><p>electricity.  The scenario is not rosy, to put it by way of </p><p>understatement, and stockbrokers said that if war does </p><p>break out in the Persian Gulf "it would not be unreasonable </p><p>to expect the All Share Price index to hit the 650 levels." </p><p>Which to the uninitiated layman would mean:  "Not too </p><p>good." </p><p> </p><p>But the impact is going to be multiple, as different </p><p>aspects of the economy are bound to get knocked about.  For </p><p>instance, the global oil market has soared, and further </p><p>increases in the price of petroleum would be a kidney punch </p><p>to a public already reeling from high prices on all </p><p>consumer items.  Spiraling inflation, if not shortages, </p><p>complete the doomsday picture. </p><p> </p><p>The knock-on effects will see pressure on interest rates, </p><p>negating the efforts of government to keep interest rates </p><p>down so that businessmen will be able to borrow more for </p><p>investment.  With borrowing costs climbing, they will have </p><p>to cut back on investment. Consumers and of course, </p><p>industry will be more directly hit - due to the possible </p><p>escalation of costs of transport and electricity which </p><p>would cause across-the-board price increases.  Not that </p><p>President George Bush Jr., would care.  He has asked our </p><p>new Ambassador to Washington DC, Devinda Subasinghe, for </p><p>our support in the days ahead. But who\'s there to support </p><p>us in this New World Order? </p><p> </p><p>The news is already in, that low grown teas are affected </p><p>due to uncertainty in the Gulf, as these teas which are </p><p>produced by small-holders in the South are in heavy demand </p><p>in Arabia.  The Southern village economy, which provides </p><p>much of the teas to the Arabian states, is already in a </p><p>tail-spin with plummeting prices and resultant cash-flow </p><p>problems.  If this happens, the tea industry would also </p><p>face labor unrest, and the industry is already aware of </p><p>this fact. </p><p> </p><p>In a sense, a war in West Asia is even deadlier for Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s fragile outback economy -- than a war at home. </p><p>While some matters will be well beyond our control, some </p><p>element of damage-control will be the most we can ask for. </p><p>While there is, no doubt, an awareness about the domestic </p><p>impact, we still see no galvanizing of minds at the higher </p><p>political levels to cushion that impact.  It\'s not too much </p><p>to ask the Prime Minister to chair some meetings with those </p><p>who matter in the coming weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Independent Sinhala daily asks whether Iraq war will </p><p>"shatter U.S.-European good will." </p><p> </p><p>On 3/9 an editorial in LAKBIMA (independent Sinhala daily) </p><p>asked, "Will the Iraq crisis shatter the US Euro good </p><p>will?"  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>The gravest issue: three of the five permanent members </p><p>oppose it....  Russia says it will use its veto power </p><p>against the American resolution ... and France is also </p><p>considering a veto. </p><p> </p><p>"The new American resolution favors only war.  The U.S. </p><p>wants it approved, by hook or by crook.... </p><p>The U.S. is unable to prove Iraqi deception.  It says not </p><p>only that Iraq should disarm but that Saddam should be </p><p>removed.  On what grounds, asks the Canadian Prime </p><p>Minister. </p><p>Even militarily, the U.S.\'s hegemonic powers are </p><p>threatened: Turkey\'s refusal has Americans considering </p><p>other military options. </p><p> </p><p>Let the international community wait and see whether </p><p>America is capable of launching a war while the whole world </p><p>protests against it.... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. SUNDAY ISLAND reprints Byrd\'s 2/12 Senate speech </p><p> </p><p>On 3/9 the SUNDAY ISLAND (Opposition English weekly) </p><p>reprinted anti-war remarks made on the Senate floor by </p><p>Senator Robert Byrd on 2/12.  The remarks were published in </p><p>the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE on 2/19; they appeared in </p><p>the SUNDAY ISLAND under the headline "We stand passively </p><p>mute."  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>This nation is about to embark upon the first test of a </p><p>revolutionary doctrine applied in an extraordinary way at </p><p>an unfortunate time. The doctrine of preemption -- the idea </p><p>that the United States or any other nation can legitimately </p><p>attack a nation that is not imminently threatening but may </p><p>be threatening in the future -- is a radical new twist on </p><p>the traditional idea of self defense. It appears to be in </p><p>contravention of international law and the UN Charter. And </p><p>it is being tested at a time of world-wide terrorism, </p><p>making many countries around the globe wonder if they will </p><p>soon be on our -- or some other nation\'s -- hit list. High </p><p>level Administration figures recently refused to take </p><p>nuclear weapons off of the table when discussing a possible </p><p>attack against Iraq. What could be more destabilizing and </p><p>unwise than this type of uncertainty, particularly in a </p><p>world where globalism has tied the vital economic and </p><p>security interests of many nations so closely together? </p><p>There are huge cracks emerging in our time-honored </p><p>alliances, and U.S. intentions are suddenly subject to </p><p>damaging worldwide speculation. Anti-Americanism based on </p><p>mistrust, misinformation, suspicion, and alarming rhetoric </p><p>from U.S. leaders is fracturing the once solid alliance </p><p>against global terrorism which existed after September 11. </p><p> </p><p>... This Administration has split traditional alliances, </p><p>possibly crippling, for all time, International order- </p><p>keeping entities like the United Nations and NATO. This </p><p>Administration has called into question the traditional </p><p>worldwide perception of the United States as well- </p><p>intentioned, peacekeeper. This Administration has turned </p><p>the patient art of diplomacy into threats, labeling, and </p><p>name calling of the sort that reflects quite poorly on the </p><p>intelligence and sensitivity of our leaders, and which will </p><p>have consequences for years to come. </p><p> </p><p>Calling heads of state pygmies, labeling whole countries as </p><p>evil, denigrating powerful European allies as irrelevant -- </p><p>these types of crude insensitivities can do our great </p><p>nation no good. We may have massive military might, but we </p><p>cannot fight a global war on terrorism alone. We need the </p><p>cooperation and friendship of our time-honored allies as </p><p>well as the newer found friends whom we can attract with </p><p>our wealth. Our awesome military machine will do us little </p><p>good if we suffer another devastating attack on our </p><p>homeland which severely damages our economy. Our military </p><p>manpower is already stretched thin and we will need the </p><p>augmenting support of those nations who can supply troop </p><p>strength, not just sign letters cheering us on. </p><p> </p><p>... to turn one\'s frustration and anger into the kind of </p><p>extremely destabilizing and dangerous foreign policy </p><p>debacle that the world is currently witnessing is </p><p>inexcusable from any Administration charged with the </p><p>awesome power and responsibility of guiding the destiny of </p><p>the greatest superpower on the planet. Frankly many of the </p><p>pronouncements made by this Administration are outrageous. </p><p>There is no other word. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
