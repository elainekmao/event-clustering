<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004180 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, EINV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: MARKET FIRMS ON Q1 GROWTH </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4061 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Turkish markets rebounded on July 1, </p><p>helped by strong growth figures for the first quarter and a </p><p>perception that relations with both the U.S. and IMF are on a </p><p>positive track, following announcements of both a July 9 IMF </p><p>mission and FM Gul\'s impending visit to Washington.  The </p><p>Treasury\'s July 1 auction met its revenue targets, providing </p><p>more than enough cash to meet its USD 4 billion July 2 </p><p>redemption.  The government\'s privatization program also </p><p>received a boost on June 30, with the privatization council\'s </p><p>decision to okay the sale of the state petrochemical company </p><p>(Petkim) to the controversial Uzan family\'s Standart Kimya. </p><p>The move surprised most market analysts, who had expected the </p><p>council to veto the deal.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Positive Auction </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) After weakening in recent days on worries about </p><p>delays in implementation of Turkey\'s IMF program, markets </p><p>firmed on July 1 as they took new heart from perceived </p><p>positive developments in relations with both the U.S. and </p><p>IMF.  Announcement that an IMF team will come to Turkey on </p><p>July 9 to continue work on the fifth review reassured </p><p>investors that a break with the fund is not on the near term </p><p>horizon, while indications that FM Gul will visit Washington </p><p>in the near future also provided hope that U.S.-Turkish </p><p>relations are mending.  Markets benefited too from strong </p><p>growth figures for 2003\'s first quarter, which at 7.4 percent </p><p>growth in GNP came in above analysts\' expectations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The positive sentiment enabled the Treasury to meet </p><p>its revenue targets in a July 1 auction and stockpile the </p><p>necessary reserves to meet its 5,681 trillion lira (USD 4 </p><p>billion) July 2 redemption to the market.  The government </p><p>sold 4.178.3 trillion lira of 413-day debt at a maximum yield </p><p>of 50.96 percent, and 1,904.9 trillion lira in 140-day debt </p><p>at a maximum yield of 44.5 percent.  The yields were close to </p><p>market expectations, but volume exceeded expectations, as </p><p>total net sales reached 6,848 trillion lira, including </p><p>non-competitive bids and sales to public institutions.  With </p><p>the total exceeding tomorrow\'s redemptions, some analysts </p><p>predict a lira shortage in coming days that could lead the </p><p>lira to appreciate further from its July 1 close of 1.409 </p><p>million to the dollar.  Only the stock market did not </p><p>strengthen on July 1, as it slipped slightly to 10,749, down </p><p>1.24 percent, in part as Petkim shares declined following </p><p>approval of its privatization (see below). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Global Security\'s chief economist Cem Akyurek told </p><p>us markets have basically concluded that there will be no </p><p>break in the IMF program: the government will continue to </p><p>negotiate, and at the end of the day will "do the minimum </p><p>necessary" to keep things on track.  Akyurek added that more </p><p>importantly "everything else is going well," with progress on </p><p>EU legislation and government determination to take on </p><p>corruption.  Adding to Turkey\'s attraction are the limited </p><p>number of equally profitable alternative investment </p><p>opportunities.  As a result, some foreign money is returning </p><p>to the country, a decision eased by the market\'s belief that </p><p>there is no reason for the lira to weaken below 1.45 million </p><p>to the dollar in coming months.  As a result, foreign </p><p>investors figure they can clear 7-8 percent in dollar terms </p><p>over the summer, a figure that cannot be matched elsewhere. </p><p>As for the long bond, one of the longest maturity papers </p><p>issued by Turkey since 2001, Akyurek noted its attractiveness </p><p>as a benchmark issuance with a high degree of liquidity, and </p><p>the opportunities investors expect it to provide for capital </p><p>gains, provided that interest rates continue to decline. </p><p>That attractiveness was reflected in a total bid volume of </p><p>7,587.8 trillion lira. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Petkim Approved </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Meanwhile, in a development that surprised most </p><p>market analysts, the Privatization High Council (PHC) set </p><p>aside concerns about the fitness of Uzan-owned Standart Kimya </p><p>and approved its purchase of the state petrochemical company, </p><p>Petkim.  Controversy had surrounded the issue, given the </p><p>Uzans\' notoriety and government concerns about the purchase </p><p>price (reftel).  The council apparently concluded, however, </p><p>that the Uzans\' earlier dealings with the Privatization </p><p>Administration (PA) were blameless, and that there was no </p><p>legal impediment to the sale.  The decision gives the PA a </p><p>good start on its ambitious USD 4 billion revenue target for </p><p>the year, as it prepares for the sale of the state refinery </p><p>(TUPRAS) and alcohol-tobacco monopoly (TEKEL).  It also </p><p>provides a first sign that in contrast to previous </p><p>governments that paid lip service to the importance of </p><p>privatization but did little in practice, this government is </p><p>actually prepared to carry it out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Newly released Central Bank figures highlight the </p><p>extent of the bank\'s activity in recent months.  Dollar </p><p>purchases in May-June totalled USD 2.115 billion, as the bank </p><p>sought to limit volatility in the market and accumulate </p><p>reserves.  The bank announced that it will increase its daily </p><p>purchases to USD 40 million a day in July, for a monthly </p><p>total of USD 880 million </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
