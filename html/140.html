<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 09 ALGIERS 05347 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:   DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:   PREL, XF, AG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ALGERIA AND THE ARAB WORLD:  MOVING FROM </p><p>          RADICALISM TO MEDIATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  KPRP-4 (FY-87) </p><p> </p><p>1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  UNLIKE ITS SELF-PERCEIVED LEADERSHIP </p><p>ROLE IN AFRICA, ALGERIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO POSITION </p><p>ITSELF IN THE ARAB WORLD AS A MEDIATOR/PEACEMAKER </p><p>AT THE CENTER OF COMPETING FACTIONS AND INTERESTS. </p><p>ALGERIA IS NO LONGER IN THE FOREFRONT OF RADICAL </p><p>ARAB CAUSES, ALTHOUGH IT STILL TRADES ON THE </p><p>FORMER ASSOCIATIONS IT ESTABLISHED UNDER BOUMEDIENE </p><p>AND THUS RETAINS ACCESS TO VIRTUALLY ALL ARAB </p><p>GROUPS.  REFLECTING PRESIDENT BENDJEDID\'S OWN </p><p>CONSENSUS-BUILDING DOMESTIC STYLE, ALGERIA HAS </p><p>WORKED FOR THE CREATION OF A GREATER ARAB MAGHREB </p><p>AS AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION UNDER WHICH REGIONAL </p><p>PROBLEMS MIGHT BE SOLVED AND HAS ATTEMPTED TO </p><p>PROMOTE PLO UNITY AS A MEANS OF MOVING THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST PEACE PROCESS FORWARD (IN CONJUNCTION WITH </p><p>RECONCILIATION EFFORTS IN LEBANON).  ALTHOUGH </p><p>PESSIMISTIC ABOUT FINDING A CONCILIATORY </p><p>BASIS FOR NEGOTIATIONS IN THE GULF WAR, ALGERIA HAS </p><p>PERSISTED IN SEEKING OPENINGS TO ACHIEVE AT LEAST </p><p>A CEASEFIRE THERE.  RELATIONS WITH THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>CONFRONTATION STATES OF SYRIA AND JORDAN HAVE </p><p>WAXED AND WANED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, AS HAVE </p><p>TIES WITH THE GULF STATES, PARTICULARLY SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA.  ALGERIA REMAINS ACTIVE IN THE ARAB LEAGUE </p><p>AND ITS VARIOUS SUB-ORGANIZATIONS, BUT IS SKEPTICAL </p><p>ABOUT THE VITALITY OF THE LEAGUE AND ITS ABILITY </p><p>TO UNITE, INSTEAD OF DIVIDE, ITS MEMBER STATES. </p><p>ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH OTHER ARAB STATES ARE BASED </p><p>ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON PETROLEUM--ITS PRICE AND </p><p>THE QUANTITIES MARKETED.  AS A PRICE "HARDLINER," </p><p>ALGERIA OFTEN FINDS ITSELF AT ODDS WITH ITS </p><p>FELLOW ARAB PRODUCERS WITHIN OPEC.  THE GOA </p><p>LEADERSHIP ALSO DEVOTES CONSIDERABLE ENERGY TO </p><p>ADVANCING ITS INTERESTS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AT </p><p>LEAST IN PART TO ENCOURAGE GREATER STABILITY AS </p><p>A HEDGE AGAINST THE POTENTIAL ENCROACHMENT OF </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM INTO NORTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>3. AS A CREDIBLE GO-BETWEEN WITH MOST ARAB GROUPS, </p><p>ALGERIA HAS CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANTLY TO THE ACHIEVE- </p><p>MENT OF SOME U.S. REGIONAL OBJECTIVES, FROM </p><p>THE MEDIATION OF THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS IN 1980/81 </p><p>TO PRESENT GOA EFFORTS IN LEBANON, AS WELL AS </p><p>ACTING AS A COUNTER TO LIBYAN INFLUENCE.  ALGERIA </p><p>WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>WITH THE U.S. ON TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC APPROACHES </p><p>TO RESOLVING NUMEROUS ARAB-RELATED ISSUES, EVEN </p><p>WHERE WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL.  HOWEVER, UNLIKE </p><p>UNDER BOUMEDIENE, THE BENDJEDID REGIME IS PREPARED </p><p>TO "REASON WITH US" AND EXPLORE POTENTIALLY WORKABLE </p><p>SOLUTIONS FREE OF THE RHETORIC WHICH PREVIOUSLY </p><p>CHARACTERIZED ALGERIAN POLICYMAKING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE MAGHREB </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. FOR ALGERIA, ITS POLICY IN THE ARAB WORLD BEGINS </p><p>WITH THE MAGHREB AND EFFORTS TO FOSTER REGIONAL </p><p>STABILITY, PARTICULARLY ALONG ITS BORDERS.  TO </p><p>FURTHER THIS GOAL THE GOA HAS PROMOTED A POLICY OF </p><p>REGIONAL UNITY UNDER THE RUBRIC OF A "GREATER ARAB </p><p>MAGHREB" AND HAS CONCLUDED A FRIENDSHIP AND CONCORD </p><p>TREATY WITH TWO OF ITS MAGHREB NEIGHBORS, TUNISIA </p><p>AND MAURITANIA.  WHILE A FUNCTIONING MAGHREB </p><p>ORGANIZATION IS STILL IN THE DISTANCE, THE IDEA </p><p>OFFERS ALGERIA A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IN WHICH TO </p><p>SEEK RESOLUTION OF SOME OF ITS MAJOR REGIONAL </p><p>PREOCCUPATIONS.  THE GOA BELIEVES A MAGHREB ORGANIZA- </p><p>TION COULD PROVIDE AN INSTITUTIONAL COVER FOR A </p><p>WESTERN SAHARA SOLUTION AND ALSO RESOLVE ALGERIA\'S </p><p>OUTSTANDING BORDER PROBLEMS WITH MOROCCO AND LIBYA. </p><p>IN ALGERIA\'S VIEW IT WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR </p><p>GREATLY EXPANDING ECONOMIC COOPERATION THROUGH </p><p>COMPLEMENTARY ECONOMIES AND A POSSIBLE FREE TRADE </p><p>ZONE PATTERNED AFTER THE COMMON MARKET.  THE GOA </p><p>BELIEVES IMPROVED REGIONAL TIES WOULD ENHANCE </p><p>POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR A </p><p>PEACEFUL TRANSITION IN TUNISIA AFTER BOURGUIBA. </p><p>FINALLY, THE GOA HOPES THAT THE POTENTIAL ADHERENCE </p><p>BY LIBYA TO SUCH A REGIONAL GROUPING WOULD </p><p>MODERATE QADHAFI\'S BEHAVIOR TO SOME EXTENT AND </p><p>INCREASE HIS STAKE IN COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>5. DESPITE ALGERIA\'S ASPIRATIONS FOR A GREATER </p><p>MAGHREB AS A SOURCE OF REGIONAL UNITY AND STRENGTH, </p><p>THE GOAL DOES NOT APPEAR ANY CLOSER TO REALIZATION </p><p>NOW THAN PRIOR TO THE MOROCCAN-LIBYAN ACCORD OF </p><p>AUGUST 1984.  ALGERIA\'S BILATERAL STRAINS WITH </p><p>MOROCCO AND THE CONTINUING UNWILLINGNESS BY QADHAFI </p><p>TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF </p><p>ALGERIA\'S AGREEMENT WITH TUNISIA AND MAURITANIA </p><p>MILITATE AGAINST A UNITED MAGHREB.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THE WESTERN SAHARA CONFLICT REMAINS A MAJOR COMPLI- </p><p>CATING FACTOR BLOCKING GREATER REGIONAL COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>6. GIVEN THE UNCERTAIN PROSPECTS FOR A GREATER </p><p>MAGHREB, THE GOA NEVERTHELESS DIRECTS ITS POLICIES </p><p>TOWARD ITS NEIGHBORS AS IF SUCH A SCHEME MIGHT </p><p>BE ACHIEVABLE.  WITH TUNISIA THE GOA FOLLOWS AN </p><p>ACTIVE POLICY OF PROMOTING ECONOMIC COOPERATION, </p><p>PROVIDING ASSURANCES AND MATERIAL SUPPORT </p><p>TO COUNTER LIBYAN PRESSURES AGAINST THE GOT, </p><p>EXCHANGING HIGH-LEVEL VISITS TO COORDINATE SOME </p><p>REGIONAL ACTIONS AND MAINTAINING AS CLOSE TIES </p><p>AS POSSIBLE WITH A VIEW TOWARD A PEACEFUL, POST- </p><p>BOURGUIBA TRANSITION.  ON LIBYA, GOA POLICY HAS </p><p>MOVED AWAY FROM RADICAL SOLIDARITY AS A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE "REJECTIONIST FRONT" TO ONE OF SOMETIMES OPEN </p><p>AND OTHER TIMES DISGUISED OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>QADHAFI REGIME.  ALGERIA OPENLY OPPOSES LIBYAN </p><p>ACTIONS IN CHAD AND ITS SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN WESTERN EUROPE.  THE GOA ATTEMPTS </p><p>TO COUNTER LIBYAN INFLUENCE IN WEST AFRICA, SUDAN, </p><p>AND EVEN AMONG RADICAL ARAB FACTIONS.  DESPITE </p><p>THESE POLICY DIFFERENCES, ALGERIA HAS, SINCE THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF 1986, TRIED TO EASE BILATERAL TENSIONS </p><p>THROUGH A MEASURED PUBLIC RAPPROCHEMENT WITH LIBYA. </p><p>THIS POLICY HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED TO US BY </p><p>BENDJEDID\'S ADVISOR GENERAL BELKHEIR AS A MEANS </p><p>OF FOLLOWING THE LIBYAN DOMESTIC SITUATION CLOSELY </p><p>WHILE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH WHICH </p><p>IT CAN MODIFY QADHAFI\'S BEHAVIOR OR HIS POSITION </p><p>WITHOUT RUINING FUTURE RELATIONS WITH A POST-QADHAFI </p><p>LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>7. CURIOUSLY, ALGERIANS FEEL THE CLOSEST AFFINITY </p><p>WITH MOROCCANS EVEN THOUGH IN GEOPOLITICAL TERMS </p><p>MOROCCO IS THE ONLY COUNTRY WHICH COULD LAY </p><p>PLAUSIBLE CLAIM TO BEING A REGIONAL RIVAL.  FOR </p><p>THE MOMENT, THAT RIVALRY IS FOCUSED ON THE WESTERN </p><p>SAHARA CONFLICT, WHICH APPEARS STALEMATED BOTH </p><p>MILITARILY AND DIPLOMATICALLY.  IT IS LIKELY THAT </p><p>THE GOA WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO ISOLATE MOROCCO </p><p>WITHIN THE REGION, IN THE ARA8 WORLD AND IN AFRICA, </p><p>AS A MEANS OF INCREASING PRESSURE FOR A NEGOTIATED </p><p>POLITICAL SETTLEMENT TO THE WESTERN SAHARA CONFLICT. </p><p>HAVING SUPPORTED THE POLISARIO CAUSE FOR THE PAST </p><p>TEN YEARS, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF DECOLONIALIZATION </p><p>FOR EVEN LONGER, THE GOA LEADERSHIP IS NOT LIKELY </p><p>TO ABANDON THE POLISARIO AND CEDE SOVEREIGNTY TO </p><p>MOROCCO WITHOUT A CREDIBLE POLITICAL PROCESS BEING </p><p>ESTABLISHED TO SETTLE THE ISSUE.  UNTIL THEN, </p><p>DESPITE THE VOICED BEST INTENTIONS OF THE TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, BILATERAL RELATIONS WILL REMAIN COM- </p><p>PETITIVE RATHER THAN COOPERATIVE, WITH THE RISK OF </p><p>DIRECT CONFRONTATION BEING LOW.  ON THE MARGINS </p><p>WILL BE COMPETITION FOR INFLUENCE IN MAURITANIA </p><p>IN WHICH THE GOA COMPETES FOR INFLUENCE THROUGH </p><p>ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE GIRM. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>EGYPT </p><p>----- </p><p>8. EGYPT, AT THE EDGE OF THE MAGHREB, HAS HAD </p><p>ALTERNATELY WARM AND COOL RELATIONS WITH ALGERIA. </p><p>DURING ALGERIA\'S INDEPENDENCE STRUGGLE NASSER\'S </p><p>EGYPT PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT MILITARY TRAINING AND </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  MANY OF THE ALGERIAN SOLDIERS WHO </p><p>SURVIVED ON THAT AID HAVE ATTAINED RANKING POSITIONS </p><p>WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY AND ARE A </p><p>SOURCE OF WARM PERSONAL CONTACTS FOR EGYPT. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS OF 1978 PUSHED </p><p>BOUMEDIENE\'S ALGERIA INTO BECOMING AN ACTIVE MEMBER </p><p>OF THE "REJECTIONIST FRONT" TO MOBILIZE ARAB </p><p>EFFORTS TO ISOLATE EGYPT.  BUT BENDJEDID BEGAN </p><p>TO MOVE ALGERIA GRADUALLY BACK TOWARD EGYPT IN </p><p>THE EARLY 1980\'S.  THE PACE OF THIS RAPPROCHEMENT </p><p>HAS ACCELERATED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>SINCE AUGUST 1984 WHEN, IN THE WAKE OF THE OUJDA </p><p>ACCORD, ALGERIA SOUGHT TO BALANCE AN INCREASED </p><p>THREAT IT PERCEIVED FROM LIBYA WITH GREATER </p><p>COORDINATION ON INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION AND THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF JOINT SECURITY MEASURES WITH </p><p>EGYPT ALONG LIBYA\'S EASTERN AND WESTERN BORDERS. </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL VISITS HAVE BECOME MORE FREQUENT AND </p><p>VISIBLE, AS HAVE CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES. </p><p>IN RECENT MONTHS, THE PACE OF IMPROVING RELATIONS </p><p>HAS SLOWED, PERHAPS AS A RESULT OF IMPROVING </p><p>EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI RELATIONS BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF A </p><p>DIMINISHED LIBYAN "THREAT."  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE HIGH-LEVEL CONTACTS CONTINUE, WITH </p><p>THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF MONITORING AND INFLUENCING </p><p>QADHAFI\'S BEHAVIOR.  IT IS NOT LIKELY THE GOA </p><p>WILL RE-ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH EGYPT ANYTIME </p><p>SOON, BUT COOPERATION WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS </p><p>EACH ATTEMPTS TO PURSUE ITS INTERESTS--ALGERIA </p><p>TO FORESTALL ANOTHER SHIFT IN EGYPTIAN POLICY ON </p><p>THE WESTERN SAHARA BACK TO FAVORING MOROCCO </p><p>(EGYPT SUPPORTED THE ALGERIAN POSITION IN THE 1985 </p><p>UNGA) AND EGYPT TO MAINTAINING SYMPATHETIC ACCESS </p><p>TO ARAB "RADICAL" STATES AND GROUPS THROUGH </p><p>ALGERIA WHEN NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>PALESTINE AND THE PALESTINIANS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. ALGERIA HAS ALWAYS PRIDED ITSELF AS BEING ONE </p><p>OF THE STRONGEST SUPPORTERS OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>CAUSE AND OF ITS MAJOR POLITICAL/MILITARY ORGANIZA- </p><p>TION, THE PLO.  ALGERIA\'S OWN EXPERIENCE IN GAINING </p><p>INDEPENDENCE HEAVILY INFLUENCES ITS VIEW OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN ISSUE AND ITS BELIEF THAT THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>PEOPLE MUST HAVE THEIR OWN LAND IN WHICH THEY CAN </p><p>EXPRESS THEIR NATIONAL CHARACTER.  AS ALGERIA WAS </p><p>ABLE TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE ONLY THROUGH THE </p><p>UNITY THE FLN DEMONSTRATED IN THE FACE OF THE </p><p>FRENCH "OCCUPATION," SO THE LOCAL CATECHISM GOES, </p><p>THE PLO WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN ITS HOMELAND ONLY </p><p>THROUGH A SIMILAR POLICY OF UNITY.  THEREFORE, THE </p><p>GOA BELIEVES PLO UNIFICATION IS ESSENTIAL IF THERE </p><p>IS TO BE ANY CHANCE OF SUCCESS FOR PEACE IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST.  ALGERIA ACKNOWLEDGES THERE ARE </p><p>SERIOUS IDEOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY DIFFERENCES </p><p>WITHIN THE PLO, BUT HAS URGED THE PLO TO SUBMERGE </p><p>THESE DIFFERENCES BEHIND A FACADE OF UNITY. </p><p>ALGERIA\'S OVERRIDING CONCERN WITH UNITY HAS </p><p>TENDED TO MAKE ALGERIA A SUPPORTER OF PLO CHIEF </p><p>ARAFAT WHO THE GOA BELIEVES IS THE ONLY PALESTINIAN </p><p>LEADER WHO HAS THE STATURE AND BROAD FOLLOWING TO </p><p>UNITE THE PALESTINIAN MOVEMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>GOA DIFFERS  WITH ARAFAT ON STRATEGY AND TACTICS, </p><p>AS IT DID IN EARLY 1985 OVER THE HOLDING OF THE </p><p>PNC IN JORDAN AND THE SUBSEQUENT AMMAN ACCORD. </p><p>(THE GOA REFRAINED FROM PUBLIC DENUNCIATION BUT </p><p>PRIVATELY EXPRESSED STRONG SKEPTICISM THAT THE </p><p>AMMAN ACCORD COULD HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECT ON </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS.) </p><p> </p><p>10. SINCE MARCH 1986 THE GOA HAS ATTEMPTED TO GIVE </p><p>SUBSTANCE TO ITS PRINCIPLES ON PLO UNITY.  FOLLOW- </p><p>ING BENDJEDID\'S MARCH 25-28 VISIT TO MOSCOW, HE </p><p>LAUNCHED A MAJOR INITIATIVE TO HOLD A UNITY MEETING </p><p>IN ALGIERS OF THE NINE PLO EXECUTIVE COUNCIL </p><p>FACTIONS.  OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS THE GOA HAS </p><p>SENT SPECIAL MISSIONS TO SYRIA, LIBYA, AND THE </p><p>USSR, AS WELL AS RECEIVED MOST OF THE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>PLO LEADERS IN ALGIERS.  THUS FAR, ALGERIAN EFFORTS </p><p>HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED BY CONTINUING INTERNAL PLO </p><p>DIFFERENCES, THE UNWILLINGNESS OF SYRIA TO CONTRIBUTE </p><p>TO A PLO UNITED BEHIND ARAFAT, AND A LACK </p><p>OF SUFFICIENT SOVIET LEVERAGE ON SYRIA TO FORCE </p><p>SYRIAN COOPERATION.  DESPITE THESE SETBACKS, THE </p><p>GOA WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR PLO UNITY, WHILE </p><p>PROVIDING MODEST MILITARY TRAINING WITHIN ALGERIA, </p><p>AS THE ONLY MEANS, IN THE GOA VIEW, OF OBTAINING </p><p>A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>11. CONCURRENTLY, THE GOA MAINTAINS SOME ACCESS TO </p><p>THE MARGINAL "RADICAL" FACTIONS IN THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST, INCLUDING ABU NIDAL, ABU MUSA, AND HIZBOLLAH. </p><p>ALGERIA HAS SERVED AS A CONDUIT TO THESE GROUPS ON </p><p>VARIOUS HOSTAGE ISSUES, BUT ALSO HAS ACQUIRED </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ON THEIR LEADERSHIP AND STRUCTURES. </p><p>IN SOME CASES, THE GOA HAS BEEN WILLING TO SHARE </p><p>THIS INTELLIGENCE WITH NON-ARAB COUNTRIES.  UNLIKE </p><p>THE BOUMEDIENE GOVERNMENT, THE PRESENT ALGERIAN </p><p>REGIME APPARENTLY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY MILITARY </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THESE FACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE MIDDLE EAST CONFRONTATION STATES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>12. ALGERIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO PLAY A MEDIATING ROLE </p><p>IN LEBANON WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF CREATING </p><p>A STABLE ARAB BASE FROM WHICH MORE EFFECTIVE </p><p>CONFRONTATION WITH ISRAEL COULD BE ORGANIZED.  IN </p><p>THE PROCESS THE GOA HOPES TO PRESERVE THE LIVES </p><p>OF PALESTINIAN REFUGEES WHO ARE ENCAMPED IN LEBANON, </p><p>END THE INTERNECINE KILLING AMONG ALGERIA\'S ARAB </p><p>BROTHERS, ENCOURAGE THE WITHDRAWAL OF SYRIAN TROOPS, </p><p>EXPEL ISRAELI TROOPS FROM SOUTHERN LEBANON, AND </p><p>EVENTUALLY RE-ESTABLISH A VIABLE LEBANESE STATE-- </p><p>ALL IN ALL A TALL ORDER.  THE GOA HAS MOVED </p><p>CAUTIOUSLY TO ACHIEVE RECONCILIATION IN LEBANON, </p><p>USING ITS FORMER AMBASSADOR (ABDELKRIM GHERAIEB) </p><p>TO OPEN CONTACTS WITH ALL LEBANESE GROUPS AND SEEK </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER TALKS AMONG </p><p>THESE GROUPS.  ALGERIAN CONTACTS WITH NABIH BERRI\'S </p><p>AMAL WERE PARTICULARLY USEFUL DURING THE JUNE 1985 </p><p>TWA HIJACKING TO SECURE THE RELEASE OF AMERICAN </p><p>CITIZENS AND MAINTAIN COMMUNICATIONS WITH U.S. </p><p>HOSTAGES REMAINING IN LEBANON.  ALTHOUGH ALGERIA </p><p>HAS SUSPENDED ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE\'S SOLIDARITY FUND FOR LEBANON, IT REMAINS </p><p>ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN LEBANESE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION </p><p>EFFORTS, RECENTLY DISPATCHING A SPECIAL ENVOY </p><p>(MINISTER OF CULTURE BOUALEM BESSAIEH) AND A </p><p>RANKING FLN PARTY MEMBER (SADEK ZOUATEN) TO EXPLORE </p><p>THE PROSPECTS FOR PROGRESS.  ALGERIA DOES PROVIDE </p><p>SOME BILATERAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF 200 </p><p>UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS ANNUALLY, BUT NOT MUCH </p><p>FINANCIAL AID DESPITE GEMAYEL\'S BEST EFFORTS. </p><p>OVER THE NEXT YEAR, THE GOA IS LIKELY TO MAINTAIN </p><p>AN ACTIVELY NEUTRAL "WATCHING BRIEF" IN LEBANON </p><p>RATHER THAN RISK ITS PRESTIGE IN A DRAMATIC POLICY </p><p>INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>13. RELATIONS WITH JORDAN HAVE IMPROVED CONSIDERABLY </p><p>SINCE THE LATE 1970\'S, INCLUDING AN EXCHANGE OF </p><p>HIGH-RANKING MILITARY DELEGATIONS AND THE VISIT OF </p><p>THE JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER IN 1985.  THE MILITARY </p><p>EXCHANGES WERE USEFUL FOR THE GOA BECAUSE THEY </p><p>PROVIDED FURTHER INSIGHTS ON HOW TO APPROACH AND </p><p>DEAL WITH WESTERN ARMS SUPPLIERS, NOTABLY THE U.K. </p><p>AND THE U.S., WITH WHOM ALGERIA HOPES TO DIVERSIFY </p><p>ITS ARMS PURCHASES.  SECONDLY, THE GOA WAS EXPOSED </p><p>TO WESTERN ARMS SYSTEMS AND THEIR CAPABILITIES. </p><p>DESPITE CRITICISM FROM RADICAL ARAB FACTIONS AND </p><p>STATES OF THE AMMAN ACCORD, ALGERIA RESERVED ITS </p><p>JUDGMENT, THUS PRESERVING ITS ENTREE WITH THE </p><p>JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT.  OTHERWISE, BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONS ARE CORDIAL WITHOUT BEIMG PARTICULARLY </p><p>PROFOUND.  WHAT IS NOTEWORTHY IS THAT ALGERIA NOW </p><p>RECOGNIZES THE VALUE OF MAINTAINING CORDIAL TIES </p><p>WITH ARAB "MODERATES" (EVEN MONARCHS), A </p><p>RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF SUCH TIES THAT ONLY </p><p>FAINTLY EXISTED IN THE PRE-BENDJEDID ERA. </p><p> </p><p>14. PERHAPS ALGERIA\'S MOST FRUSTRATING POLITICAL </p><p>RELATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST ARE WITH SYRIA, A </p><p>COUNTRY WITH WHICH ALGERIA USED TO SHARE AN </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL AFFINITY AND INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK. </p><p>THE IDEOLOGICAL AFFINITY HAS BEEN FADING RAPIDLY </p><p>IN RECENT YEARS, AND ALGERIA\'S INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PERSPECTIVE HAS BEGUN TO DIVERGE SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>FROM THAT OF SYRIA IN THE PAST 18 MONTHS.  ALGERIA </p><p>NO LONGER FINDS ITSELF ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A </p><p>REJECTIONIST FRONT MEETING AND IS RELUCTANT TO </p><p>RECONSTITUTE SUCH A FRONT.  WHILE SYRIA SUPPORTS </p><p>ALGERIA ON THE WESTERN SAHARA AND COOPERATES WITH </p><p>ALGERIA IN EFFORTS TO ISOLATE MOROCCO, IT REMAINS </p><p>THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO ALGERIA\'S ATTEMPT TO UNIFY </p><p>THE PLO. ALGERIA HAS ALSO BEEN CRITICAL OF SYRIA\'S </p><p>ROLE IN LEBANON (AS A COMPLICATING FACTOR </p><p>PREVENTING RECONCILIATION) AND HAS BEEN UNHAPPY </p><p>WITH SYRIA\'S SUPPORT FOR HIZBOLLAHS "TERRORIST" </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  NEVERTHELESS, THE TWO COUNTRIES </p><p>MAINTAIN VERY ACTIVE HIGH-LEVEL CONTACTS TO </p><p>COORDINATE POLICIES OF MUTUAL INTEREST, WITH THE </p><p>GOA HOPING FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT ON PLO UNITY </p><p>AND SYRIA HOPING TO EXCHANGE THIS FOR A NEW </p><p>REJECTIONIST FRONT. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE GULF WAR </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>15. THE WAR BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ, LIKE THEIR </p><p>PREVIOUS DISPUTE IN THE 1970\'S MEDIATED BY ALGERIA, </p><p>IS AN ONGOING CONCERN FOR THE GOA.  IN DISCUSSING </p><p>THE SITUATION, FOREIGN MINISTER IBRAHIMI IS ALWAYS </p><p>QUICK TO POINT OUT HIS PREDECESSER LOST HIS LIFE </p><p>TRYING TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE WAR.  PERHAPS </p><p>BECAUSE OF THIS SETBACK, AND ALGERIAN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT </p><p>OF THE CONTINUING INTRANSIGENCE OF BOTH PARTIES, THE </p><p>GOA HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO TAKE ANY NEW INITIATIVE </p><p>ON THE WAR.  IN THE INTERIM ALGERIA HAS MAINTAINED </p><p>ITS CREDIBILITY WITH IRAN BY ABSTAINING ON ONE- </p><p>SIDED ARAB LEAGUE RESOLUTIONS FAVORING IRAQ AND </p><p>CONTINUING HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGES.  THE GOA HAS USED </p><p>THESE CONTACTS TO PROBE IRANIAN FLEXIBILITY, THUS </p><p>FAR WITHOUT ANY POSITIVE RESULTS, ADDING TO THE </p><p>PESSIMISM IBRAHIMI HAS EXPRESSED TO US.  RECENT </p><p>IRANIAN GAINS AND OCCUPATION OF IRAQI TERRITORY </p><p>HAVE "TILTED" ALGERIAN POLICY TOWARD IRAQ.  HOWEVER, </p><p>ALGERIA IS ONE OF THE ONLY COUNTRIES WHICH CAN </p><p>APPROACH EITHER IRAN OR IRAQ TO ARRANGE A CEASEFIRE </p><p>THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA AND THE GULF STATES </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. ALGERIAN RELATIONS IN THE GULF, AS FOR OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES, REVOLVE AROUND TIES WITH SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p>IN THIS REGARD, WHILE THE TENOR OF GOA-SAG RELATIONS </p><p>HAS IMPROVED TO THE LEVEL OF A POLITE DIALOGUE, </p><p>THERE ARE MAJOR SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCES PREVENTING </p><p>CLOSER COOPERATION.  SIMILAR TO THE SAUDIS, THE </p><p>ALGERIANS ARE QUICK TO TAKE OFFENSE AT PERCEIVED </p><p>SLIGHTS AND THEY ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE </p><p>ETIQUETTE OF RELATIONS, GRANTING OR WITHDRAWING </p><p>ACCESS FOR SAUDI EMISSARIES DEPENDING ON TREATMENT </p><p>ACCORDED TO ALGERIANS.  BEYOND SUCH ATMOSPHERIC </p><p>ISSUES, THE GOA HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF SAUDI SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE MOROCCAN WAR EFFORT IN THE WESTERN SAHARA, </p><p>SAUDI STRATEGY WITHIN OPEC, AND SAUDI PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN THE EXTRAORDINARY ARAB SUMMIT ORGANIZED IN </p><p>CASABLANCA IN AUGUST 1985.  FM IBRAHIMI HAS ALSO </p><p>VOICED IMPATIENCE OVER REPEATED SAUDI REQUESTS FOR </p><p>ALGERIAN INTERVENTION WITH "RADICAL" ARABS WITHOUT </p><p>RECEIVING RECIPROCAL SAUDI SUPPORT ON THE WESTERN </p><p>SAHARA.  NEVERTHELESS, ALGERIA RECOGNIZES THE </p><p>DEGREE OF SAUDI INFLUENCE WITHIN OPEC, THE ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE AND WITH THE MOROCCAN GOVERNMENT, AND </p><p>HAS ATTEMPTED TO EMPLOY A QUIET DIPLOMACY IN THE </p><p>PAST YEAR TO MODIFY SAUDI POLICIES.  THE GOA GIVES </p><p>ITSELF CREDIT FOR SOME PROGRESS WITHIN OPEC AND </p><p>IS MODESTLY OPTIMISTIC THAT SAUDI ARABIA WILL </p><p>AGREE TO HOLD AN ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT IN DECEMBER </p><p>TO "CLOSE ARAB RANKS."  (THIS WOULD BE THE LONG- </p><p>DELAYED SUMMIT ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR 1984.) </p><p>ON THE WESTERN SAHARA, THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>17. ALGERIA MAINTAINS CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH KUWAIT, </p><p>THE UAE, AND OMAN.  THE GOA JUST ASSIGNED NEW </p><p>RESIDENT AMBASSADORS TO BAHRAIN AND QATAR, AND THIS </p><p>MAY PORTEND AN UPSURGE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS.  HOWEVER, RELATIONS </p><p>ARE LIKELY TO FOCUS CHIEFLY ON OIL PRICING AND </p><p>PERHAPS SECONDARILY ON KEEPING THE "WOLF" OF ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM AWAY FROM THE GULF\'S DOOR.  FURTHER </p><p>SOUTHWEST, ALGERIA WAS DISTURBED BY THE OVERTHROW </p><p>OF THE ALI NASIR MUHAMED REGIME IN SOUTH YEMEN AND </p><p>THE SOVIET ROLE IN SUPPORTING HIS SUCCESSOR.  THE </p><p>GOA LEADERSHIP DERIVED A CERTAIN LESSON FROM THESE </p><p>EVENTS AND HAS INFUSED A COOLNESS INTO ITS </p><p>FORMERLY CLOSE RELATIONS WITH SOUTH YEMEN. </p><p>INFREQUENT CONTACTS PERSIST WITH ALI NASIR MUHAMED, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE ALGERIANS HAVE NOT ASSISTED ANY </p><p>EFFORTS TO OVERTHROW THE ATTAS GOVERNMGNT.  ON </p><p>THE CONTRARY, THERE HAS BEEN A RELUCTANT ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF ATTAS, WHO IS EXPECTED TO VISIT ALGIERS </p><p>LATER THIS YEAR OR IN EARLY 1987.  AS FOR NORTH </p><p>YEMEN, THE YAR JUST APPOINTED A NEW AMBASSADOR </p><p>TO ALGIERS WHO APPEARS WELL-CONNECTED WITHIN </p><p>SANAA, POSSIBLY SIGNIFYING IMPROVING </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  ALGERIA HAS </p><p>COORDINATED TO A SMALL EXTENT ITS RESPONSES WITH </p><p>NORTH YEMEN ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FALL OF </p><p>ALI NASIR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>THE ARAB LEAGUE </p><p>--------------- </p><p>18. FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS ALGERIA HAS VIEWED THE </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE AS A NEARLY MORIBUND, INCREASINGLY </p><p>IRRELEVANT ORGANIZATION, REFLECTIVE OF THE </p><p>DISARRAY IN THE ARAB WORLD.  APPARENTLY,THOUGH, </p><p>WITHIN THE PAST TWO MONTHS THE GOA HAS SEIZED UPON </p><p>THE LEAGUE AS A POTENTIAL VEHICLE FOR RENEWING/ </p><p>REVITALIZING ARAB UNITY.  TO THIS END THE GOA HAS </p><p>SENT EMISSARIES TO DAMASCUS (MESSAADIA), SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA (IBRAHIMI) AND BEIRUT (BESSAIH/ZOUATEN) </p><p>TO LOBBY FOR THE NECESSITY OF A SUMMIT, OPTIMISTICALLY </p><p>IN DECEMBER.  THE GOA HAS ALSO USED THE ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE TO REINFORCE ITS CREDIBILITY WITH IRAN </p><p>BY OPPOSING ANTI-IRANIAN RESOLUTIONS ON THE GULF </p><p>WAR.  HOWEVER, ALGERIA HAS BEEN LESS SUCCESSFUL </p><p>IN GAINING ARAB SUPPORT ON THE WESTERN SAHARA </p><p>ISSUE, AND THIS HAS HINDERED ALGERIAN EFFORTS TO </p><p>GAIN SDAR ADMISSION INTO THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT </p><p>(NAM).  FURTHERMORE, THE GOA HAS BEEN UNHAPPY WITH </p><p>THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEAGUE AND HAS WORKED </p><p>TO BOTH STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS </p><p>AT THE LEAGUE\'S HEADQUARTERS IN TUNIS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ECONOMIC RELATIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p>19. OIL AND HYDROCARBON REVENUES ARE THE LIFEBLOOD </p><p>OF THE ALGERIAN ECONOMY, AND THEREFORE DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>AFFECTING OIL ARE CRITICAL TO ALGERIA\'S WELFARE. </p><p>ALGERIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN HIGH PRICES WHILE </p><p>PRESSURING MAJOR PRODUCERS TO ACCEPT "REASONABLE" </p><p>PRODUCTION LEVELS, PARTICULARLY SAUDI ARABIA.  THIS </p><p>PRESSURE HAS BEEN COORDINATED WITH LIBYA AND IRAN </p><p>PRINCIPALLY, BUT RECENTLY THE GOA HAS TRIED TO </p><p>FORM AN ASSOCIATION OF AFRICAN PRODUCERS FOR A </p><p>SIMILAR OBJECTIVE.  AS PRICES HAVE STABILIZED </p><p>SINCE AUGUST, ALGERIA HAS TAKEN SOME SATISFACTION </p><p>FROM ITS EFFORTS, EVEN IF IN REALITY THEY HAD ONLY </p><p>A MARGINAL IMPACT ON OPEC DECISIONS.  BESIDES OIL, </p><p>THERE IS VERY LITTLE TRADE BY ALGERIA WITHIN THE </p><p>ARAB MARKET, AND ONLY A BARELY MORE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>MONETARY INTEREST BY ARAB BANKS AND FINANCIAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE ARAB DEVELOPMENT BANK </p><p>AND THE SAUDI DEVELOPMENT BANK.  WE BELIEVE LOANS </p><p>FROM THESE SOURCES WERE LESS THAN $100 MILLION, </p><p>REPRESENTING A DECLINE FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. </p><p>THUS, AS THE OIL MARKET GOES, SO GO ALGERIA\'S </p><p>TRADE RELATIONS IN THE ARAB WORLD, HAVING SOME </p><p>REPERCUSSIONS FOR ITS POLITICAL RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>20. AS IN MOST ARAB COUNTRIES, ISLAM IS THE STATE </p><p>RELIGION IN ALGERIA AND, AS SUCH, ENJOYS A </p><p>PRIVILEGED POSITION VIS-A-VIS OTHER INSTITUTIONS. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS ATTEMPTED TO CO-OPT ISLAMIC </p><p>PRECEPTS AND VALUES BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO </p><p>THE NATIONAL CHARTER AND BY ENCOURAGING MOSQUE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION AND PAYING AND TRAINING THE IMAMS. </p><p>THERE IS ALSO SUBSTANTIAL ANNUAL SUPPORT FOR ALGERIAN </p><p>PILGRIMS TO PERFORM THE HAJJ TO MECCA. </p><p>HOWEVER, WHEN EXTERNAL INFLUENCES HAVE ATTEMPTED </p><p>TO INVADE THE GOA\'S MONOPOLY ON ISLAM, IT REACTS </p><p>VIGOROUSLY.  THE GOA WAS PARTICULARLY INCENSED </p><p>BY LIBYAN EFFORTS IN 1983-84 TO FUND "PRIVATE" </p><p>MOSQUES, WHICH THE GOA CORRECTLY VIEWED AS SOURCES </p><p>OF FUNDAMENTALISM.  RUMORS OF SAUDI FINANCING TO </p><p>ALGERIAN ISLAMISTS IN MID-1986 ALSO RAISED GOA </p><p>SUSPICIONS ABOUT SAUDI INTENTIONS.  THE GOA CON- </p><p>TINUES TO BE CONCERNED BY BEN BELLA\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>USE ISLAM TO RECRUIT ANTI-REGIME ELEMENTS.  TO </p><p>COUNTER THESE ACTIVITIES, THE GOA HAS WORKED CLOSELY </p><p>WITH THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT TO RECRUIT </p><p>TRADITIONALLY ORIENTED ISLAMIC SCHOLARS TO STAFF </p><p>ALGERIA\'S NEW UNIVERSITY OF ISLAMIC AND SCIENTIFIC </p><p>STUDIES IN CONSTANTINE.  THE GOA ALSO TRIES TO </p><p>CONTROL THE INFLOW OF ISLAMIC MATERIALS, SUCH AS </p><p>RECORDED SERMONS AND LITERATURE, WITH ONLY </p><p>MODERATE SUCCESS.  DESPITE RELATIVELY ACTIVE </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE EFFECTS </p><p>OF FUNDAMENTALISM, THE GOA DOES NOT APPEAR TO </p><p>COORDINATE ITS RESPONSES WITH ITS MAGHREB NEIGHBORS. </p><p>FOR ALGERIA, FUNDAMENTALISM REMAINS MORE OF A LONG- </p><p>TERM POTENTIAL PROBLEM RATHER THAN AN IMMEDIATE </p><p>THREAT, AND AS SUCH IS USUALLY NOT ON ALGERIA\'S </p><p>AGENDA IN ITS BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH MOST </p><p>ARAB COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S. </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21. MUTUAL U.S.-ALGERIAN EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS HAVE HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON </p><p>ALGERIA\'S APPROACH ON NUMEROUS ARAB-RELATED </p><p>ISSUES.  DESPITE OUR DISAGREEMENT OVER TACTICS, </p><p>OUR SHARED DISTRUST OF QADHAFI HAS ALLOWED US TO </p><p>MAINTAIN A USEFUL DIALOGUE WITH THE GOA ON LIBYA. </p><p>SIMILARLY, ALGERIA HAS ADOPTED A CONSTRUCTIVE, </p><p>NON-AGGRESSIVE POSTURE TOWARD TUNISIA TO CONTRIBUTE </p><p>TO A STABLE TRANSITION THERE.  ALGERIAN REACTIONS </p><p>WERE RELATIVELY MUTED TO THE U.S. RAID ON </p><p>TRIPOLI (APRIL 15), AND, AFTER A BRIEF PAUSE, </p><p>THERE WAS AN UPSURGE IN BILATERAL COOPERATION </p><p>ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM, INCLUDING MILITARY AND </p><p>SECURITY INTERESTS.  FOREIGN MINISTRY SECGEN HAMDANI </p><p>EXPLAINED TO US THAT ALGERIAN EFFORTS TO HAVE THE </p><p>PLO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE </p><p>THE PLO TO RESPOND TO PEACE INITIATIVES IN A MORE </p><p>POSITIVE MANNER.  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN </p><p>COOPERATIVE EFFORTS MADE TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE </p><p>OF U.S. HOSTAGES IN LEBANON, AIDED BY ALGERIA\'S </p><p>ACCESS TO THOSE RADICAL GROUPS HOLDING THE AMERICANS. </p><p>FINALLY, THE GOA HAS RECENTLY TAKEN STEPS TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. ON COUNTERING TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. THESE CONCRETE ACTIONS BY THE GOA TO WORK WITH </p><p>THE U.S. ON ARAB-RELATED ISSUES THAT AFFECT OUR </p><p>INTERESTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED TOO IN ALGERIA\'S </p><p>RHETORICAL PUBLIC APPROACH, WITH A LOWERING OF </p><p>DIRECT CRITICISM, EVEN WHILE VOTING AGAINST U.S. </p><p>POSITIONS IN INTERNATIONAL FORA.  THE GOA LEADERSHIP </p><p>HAS BEEN WILLING TO PAY A DOMESTIC PRICE FOR THIS </p><p>POLICY, DEFLECTING CRITICISM BY INTERNAL HARDLINERS </p><p>AND MOVING FORWARD, ALBEIT GRADUALLY, WITH A VARIETY </p><p>OF BILATERAL PROGRAMS.  ACTIVE U.S. SUPPORT FOR </p><p>ISRAEL, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT TOUCHES UPON NORTH </p><p>AFRICA, AS IT DID IN THE OCTOBER 1985 ISRAELI </p><p>BOMBING OF PLO HEADQUARTERS IN TUNIS, WILL GIVE </p><p>THE GOA SERIOUS INTERNAL DIFFICULTIES IN WORKING </p><p>TOWARD BROADLY DEEPER COOPERATION ON ARAB-RELATED </p><p>ISSUES.  HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE A GROWING CAPACITY </p><p>TO SEPARATE ISRAELI ACTIONS FROM U.S. POLICIES, </p><p>AS APPEARS TO BE THE CASE WITH ALGERIAN ACCUSATIONS </p><p>OF ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN MOROCCO.  IF THIS TREND </p><p>CONTINUES, IT MIGHT BE A STRONG INDICATION </p><p>THAT OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP HAS TAKEN ON AN </p><p>IMPORTANCE WHICH COULD TRANSCEND PREVIOUS ALGERIAN </p><p>CONVICTIONS THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF ARAB SOLIDARITY </p><p>WAS THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IN ITS </p><p>POLICY FORMULATION.  IN ANY CASE, IT IS CLEAR </p><p>THAT ALGERIA NOW INCLUDES POTENTIAL U.S. </p><p>REACTIONS AS PART OF ITS POLICY DELIBERATIONS AND </p><p>FREQUENTLY GIVES THESE REACTIONS CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT </p><p>IN ITS DECISION-MAKING.  THIS WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE U.S. WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE GOA TO ADVANCE OUR INTERESTS IN </p><p>THE ARAB WORLD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JOHNSTONE </p><p></p></div>
