(U) CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES ROBERT PORTER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02136  01 OF 02  300933Z </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: IN A MEETING WITH STAFFDEL AT A SHELTER </p><p>FOR GIRLS IN HCMC, A CATHOLIC NUN DESCRIBED A GRADUAL </p><p>TENDENCY ON THE PART OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW </p><p>GREATER LATITUDE TO THE NUNS TO OPERATE THE SHELTER, </p><p>ALBEIT WITH SOME CONTINUED RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  THE SHELTER IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF CATHOLIC </p><p>CHARITABLE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT HAVE OPENED OVER THE </p><p>PAST SEVERAL YEARS.  THE NUNS AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>SEEM TO HAVE BUILT UP A GREAT DEAL OF TRUST IN THE PAST </p><p>FEW YEARS, BUT SOME UNEASINESS REMAINS ON BOTH SIDES. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON AUGUST 14, JOSEPH REES (COUNSEL TO THE HOUSE </p><p>COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS) AND BRIAN </p><p>GUNDERSON (CHIEF OF STAFF TO HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER) </p><p>VISITED THE THANH XUAN HOUSE FOR GIRLS IN HCMC, A </p><p>SHELTER FOR GIRLS IN DANGER OF SEXUAL OR LABOR </p><p>EXPLOITATION MANAGED BY TWO CATHOLIC NUNS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO SISTER LIEN (WHO BELONGS TO THE </p><p>CATHOLIC ORDER AMOUR DE LA CROIX), SISTER GIAO OF THE </p><p>FRANCISCAN ORDER FIRST ESTABLISHED THANH XUAN HOUSE IN </p><p>1995.  SISTER GIAO HAD RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR A </p><p>SHELTER FOR YOUNG GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED OR </p><p>WHO WERE BEING FORCED INTO EXPLOITATIVE LABOR </p><p>SITUATIONS.  HER GOAL WAS ALSO TO BEGIN HEALING THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02136  01 OF 02  300933Z </p><p>WOUNDS OF ABUSE.  GIRLS WERE REFERRED BY A PARENT OR BY </p><p>CONCERNED NEIGHBORS IN HCMC\'S BINH THANH DISTRICT, </p><p>WHERE THE HOUSE WAS LOCATED.  WITHIN A WEEK OF ITS </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT, DISTRICT AUTHORITIES CLOSED THE HOUSE </p><p>FOR TWO MONTHS UNTIL SISTER GIAO RECEIVED AN OFFICIAL </p><p>PERMIT.  (NOTE: SISTER GIAO WAS OUT OF TOWN DURING THE </p><p>STAFFDEL\'S VISIT AND SO WAS UNABLE TO MEET WITH THEM.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) SISTER LIEN RECOUNTED THAT ONE OF THE CONDITIONS </p><p>OF THE OFFICIAL PERMIT WAS THAT THE LOCAL DISTRICT </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, INVALIDS AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS </p><p>(DOLISA) WOULD OFFICIALLY MANAGE THE HOUSE.  DOLISA </p><p>ASSIGNED THREE SOCIAL WORKERS TO OPERATE THE HOUSE, </p><p>ALLOWING SISTER GIAO ONLY TO ASSIST.  AFTER THREE OR </p><p>FOUR MONTHS, ALL THREE DOLISA WORKERS QUIT THE JOB, SO </p><p>DOLISA RECRUITED THREE MORE SOCIAL WORKERS; ALL OF THEM </p><p>ALSO DEPARTED WITHIN SIX MONTHS.  WHEN IT BECAME </p><p>APPARENT DOLISA WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTIES </p><p>FINDING SOCIAL WORKERS TO FILL THE JOBS, IT ALLOWED </p><p>SISTER GIAO TO TAKE OVER MANAGEMENT OF THE HOUSE AND TO </p><p>BRING ON SISTER LIEN AS AN ASSISTANT, SHE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE GOVERNMENT GIVES THANH XUAN HOUSE NO </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT, STATED SISTER LIEN.  ALL DONATIONS </p><p>ARE MADE PRIVATELY; MOST COME FROM INDIVIDUALS.  SISTER </p><p>LIEN SAID THE BULK OF THE CHARITY\'S CURRENT FUNDING </p><p>COMES FROM FRIENDS AND RELATIVES OF SISTER GIAO WHO </p><p>LIVE IN THE U.S.  SISTER LIEN ADDED THAT THE DOLISA </p><p>MANAGEMENT BOARD HAD INSPECTED THE HOUSE ONCE OR TWICE </p><p>EVERY WEEK IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE, BUT </p><p>NOW ONLY ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.  SHE SAID LOCAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02136  01 OF 02  300933Z </p><p>POLICE ALSO COME BY OCCASIONALLY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) SISTER LIEN EMPHASIZED SHE AND SISTER GIAO </p><p>GENERALLY HAVE A FREE HAND IN RUNNING THANH XUAN HOUSE. </p><p>THERE ARE ONLY TWO NOTABLE RESTRICTIONS: FIRST, SHE AND </p><p>SISTER GIAO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WEAR RELIGIOUS CLOTHES </p><p>THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THEM AS CATHOLIC NUNS.  SECOND, </p><p>THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TEACH RELIGION IN THE HOUSE. </p><p>THE GIRLS ARE ALLOWED, HOWEVER, TO ATTEND RELIGIOUS </p><p>SERVICES OF THEIR OWN FAITH.  SISTER LIEN SAID THAT </p><p>AMONG THE 26 GIRLS CURRENTLY RESIDENT AT THE HOUSE, </p><p>THERE ARE ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF CATHOLICS AND </p><p>BUDDHISTS, ALONG WITH ONE CAO DAI BELIEVER AND ONE </p><p>MUSLIM. (DURING A TOUR OF THE LIVING QUARTERS, STAFFDEL </p><p>SAW A LARGE POSTER OF JESUS CHRIST OVER ONE OF THE </p><p>BEDS, AND A SMALL BUDDHA STATUE NEXT TO ANOTHER BED.) </p><p>SHE SAID THAT SOME OF THE CATHOLIC GIRLS GO TO DAILY </p><p>MASS.  SHE NOTED THAT THE POLICE COME AROUND NEAR </p><p>CHRISTMAS AND EASTER TO ASK IF THE NUNS HAVE ANY </p><p>SPECIAL PLANS FOR THE CHILDREN.  "WE DO ORGANIZE A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02136  02 OF 02  300934Z </p><p>CHRISTMAS PARTY," SISTER LIEN SAID, "AND WE INVITE THE </p><p>POLICE TO ATTEND.  THEY DON\'T COME, BUT THEY DON\'T </p><p>BOTHER US ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IT IS AN INTERNATIONALLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED HOLIDAY." </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) SISTER LIEN STATED THAT THANH XUAN HOUSE IS </p><p>LICENSED TO HOLD UP TO 20 GIRLS, BUT CURRENTLY HAS 26 </p><p>RESIDENTS.  SISTER GIAO HAS APPLIED TO DOLISA TO </p><p>UPGRADE AND EXPAND, BUT SO FAR PERMISSION HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>FORTHCOMING.  SHE NOTED WITH SOME APPARENT BITTERNESS </p><p>THAT A NEWER SHELTER IN THE SAME LOCAL DISTRICT, </p><p>MANAGED BY THE DISTRICT WOMEN\'S UNION, RECENTLY </p><p>UPGRADED ITS FACILITIES WITH THE HELP OF FUNDS FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS OF AUSTRALIA AND CANADA.  THE GVN DIRECTS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AID TOWARD GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, SHE </p><p>CLAIMED.  SHE ADDED THAT THE POLICE HAD VISITED THE DAY </p><p>BEFORE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE STAFFDEL VISIT.  SHE SAID </p><p>SHE UNDERSTOOD THIS TO BE A WARNING TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT </p><p>WHAT SHE SAID TO THE STAFFDEL. </p><p> </p><p>HEALING THE WOUNDS OF ABUSE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) ACCORDING TO SISTER LIEN, THANH XUAN HOUSE IS </p><p>ALLOWED TO PROVIDE SHELTER TO GIRLS UP TO THE AGE OF </p><p>18.  ALTHOUGH CURRENTLY ALL 26 GIRLS SHELTERED AT THE </p><p>HOUSE AT ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 6 TO 14, SEVERAL GIRLS </p><p>UP TO THE AGE OF 18 HAVE STAYED AT THE HOUSE </p><p>PREVIOUSLY.  MOST OF THE GIRLS ATTEND REGULAR PUBLIC </p><p>SCHOOLS.  ACCORDING TO SISTER LIEN, THE NUNS TRAIN ALL </p><p>THE GIRLS TO MAKE HANDICRAFTS AFTER REGULAR SCHOOL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02136  02 OF 02  300934Z </p><p>HOURS.  IN ADDITION, WHEN GIRLS 15- TO 18-YEARS OLD ARE </p><p>RESIDENT AT THE HOUSE, THE NUNS ARRANGE FOR THEM TO </p><p>RECEIVE VOCATIONAL TRAINNG IN PHOTOGRAPHY AND SEWING. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) SISTER IEN POINTED OUT SEVERAL OF THE GIRLS </p><p>AND GAVE A KETCH OF EACH ONE\'S PERSONAL HISTORY.  A </p><p>NEIGHBO RAPED ONE 6-YEAR-OLD.  THE MOTHER BROUGHT HER </p><p>TO THANH XUAN HOUSE FOR PROTECTION.  THE MOTHER OF A 9- </p><p>YEAR-OLD HAS TUBERCULOSIS, SO THE CHILD WAS BROUGHT TO </p><p>THE HOUSE UNTIL MEDICATIONS RENDERED THE MOTHER NON- </p><p>INFECTIOUS.  A 7-YEAR-OLD HAD BEEN SOLD BY HER PARENTS </p><p>TO A BROKER IN DONG NAI PROVINCE WHO IN TURN SOLD HER </p><p>TO A CHILDLESS COUPLE.  THE NEW FATHER BEAT HER SO </p><p>SEVERELY, HOWEVER, THAT THE NEIGHBORS REPORTED IT TO </p><p>THE POLICE.  SISTER LIEN SAID MOST OF THE GIRLS AT THE </p><p>HOUSE HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE POLICE, BY THE LOCAL </p><p>YOUTH UNION, OR BY THE LOCAL WOMEN\'S UNION. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) SISTER LIEN SAID SHE FINDS EMPLOYMENT FOR </p><p>GIRLS WHO ARE TURNING 18 AND CAN NO LONGER STAY AT THE </p><p>HOUSE.  SHE AND SISTER GIAO ALSO TRY TO RECONCILE THE </p><p>GIRLS WITH THEIR PARENTS WHEN POSSIBLE.  SHE SAID 40 </p><p>GIRLS HAVE ALREADY"GRADUATED," AND SHE MAINTAINS </p><p>CONTACT WITH ALL F THEM.  MOST HAVE GONE ON TO HAPPIER </p><p>LIVES, BUT OT ALL OF THEM.  AT PRESENT, SHE IS </p><p>MONITORING TE SITUATION OF A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO </p><p>RETURNED HME, BUT WHOSE STEPFATHER MAY BE TREATING HER </p><p>UNKNDLY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02136  02 OF 02  300934Z </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THANH XUAN HUSE FOR GIRLS IS ONLY ONE OF </p><p>SEVERAL CATHOLIC CHAITABLE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE </p><p>OPENED IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN HCMC AND IN OTHER </p><p>TOWNS IN SOUTHERN VIETNAM.  LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STILL </p><p>APPEAR TO BE WARY OF NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND </p><p>SEEK TO CONTROL THEM BY AFFILIATING THEM WITH A LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND BY CLOSE MONITORING.  HOWEVER, IT </p><p>APPEARS THAT AS LOCAL OFFICIALS RECOGNIZE THAT THANH </p><p>XUAN HOUSE AND OTHER PRIVATE CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS </p><p>ARE HELPING TO MEET SOME OF HCMC\'S MOST SERIOUS SOCIAL </p><p>AND HUMANITARIAN NEEDS, THEIR INSISTENCE ON OVERT </p><p>CONTROL AND MONITORING IS GRADUALLY GIVING WAY TO AN </p><p>ATTITUDE OF MORE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) THE STAFFDEL DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>CLEAR THIS CABLE BEFORE DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
