According to sources, a number of </p><p>factors are acting to demoralize the military, including </p><p>pressure from the Tamil Tigers, stresses in the </p><p>relationship between the PM and the President, and </p><p>frictions with the police.  The military as a whole </p><p>appears to support the peace process, but there are some </p><p>reports of dissension.  Caught in a transition period </p><p>between war and possible peace, the military is clearly </p><p>troubled and needs careful tending by the GSL.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>================================= </p><p>Difficult Period for the Military </p><p>================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) There are increasing reports indicating that the </p><p>Sri Lankan military is in a difficult period.  Hardly a </p><p>day goes by without the press reporting some sort of </p><p>flare-up involving the armed forces.  Many of these </p><p>reports pit the military against the Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in some small incident or paint </p><p>members of the military engaged in infighting with one </p><p>another.  Commenting on the rash of reports, Jehan </p><p>Perera, the Director of the National Peace Council, a </p><p>local think-tank, told polchief October 1 that he </p><p>thought the military was in a "very confused state </p><p>because it was caught in a transition period between war </p><p>and possible peace."  He noted that the military used to </p><p>be focused on all-out confrontation versus the LTTE. </p><p>With the ceasefire in effect, however the military does </p><p>not have a "central objective" at this time and is "a </p><p>bit lost." </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>Pinpricks by the LTTE </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) An analysis of the latest reports indicates that </p><p>several factors seem to be acting to demoralize the </p><p>military, including pressure from the Tamil Tigers, </p><p>stresses in the relationship between the PM and the </p><p>President, and frictions with the police.  With respect </p><p>to the first factor, the LTTE seems to be engaged in a </p><p>strategy of engaging the military in small pinprick-type </p><p>actions that fall well short of war, but are meant to </p><p>harass and preoccupy. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) One of the more serious of these problematic </p><p>incidents involves the ongoing detention of seven Sri </p><p>Lankan soldiers held by the LTTE since September 25 (see </p><p>Ref A).  The LTTE has demanded the release of two of its </p><p>cadre in exchange for the release of the soldiers. </p><p>Based on what we are hearing, the GSL -- not wanting the </p><p>incident to become a crisis -- is squirming to find a </p><p>way to release the LTTE cadre.  (Note:  Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, an important minister, told DCM, October 2, </p><p>that the GSL is "leaning" on the judicial system to </p><p>speed up the processing of the two LTTE detainees so </p><p>that they can be eligible for bail as soon as possible.) </p><p>In the meantime, the military is helpless to do </p><p>anything.  Brigadier Peiris, the Director of Legal </p><p>Affairs at Army Headquarters, told us that the incident </p><p>was shameful to the military, especially given the fact </p><p>that families of the soldiers have been publicly </p><p>demonstrating for their release, but to no avail. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) Another incident that has disturbed the military </p><p>was the attempted overrunning of a military post located </p><p>in the town of Point Pedro in Jaffna on September 2. </p><p>During this incident, a large group of Tamil grade </p><p>school students attacked the post, damaging a number of </p><p>bunkers and other military positions before being driven </p><p>back.  Several people were injured in the attack, which </p><p>was apparently instigated by the LTTE.  In discussions </p><p>with Mission, military officers report dozens of smaller </p><p>but similar incidents involving troops who were </p><p>physically or verbally harassed by LTTE cadre or pro- </p><p>LTTE Tamils in various demeaning ways.  Again, due to </p><p>the ceasefire, the military has not been able to do much </p><p>to counter the LTTE and prevent such incidents. </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>Cohabitation Stresses </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) Stresses in the cohabitation relationship </p><p>between the Prime Minister and President Kumaratunga </p><p>also seem to be playing a role in the military\'s </p><p>troubles.  Essentially, the deep tensions between the PM </p><p>and the President are creating an unstable situation for </p><p>the military in that it is not quite certain who it is </p><p>that it reports to. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S) The crux of the confusion comes from the fact </p><p>that the PM is clearly politically the most powerful </p><p>person in the country at this time, while Kumaratunga </p><p>technically remains commander-in-chief of the armed </p><p>forces under the terms of the Sri Lankan Constitution. </p><p>Caught in this ambiguity, the military in effect is </p><p>being forced to choose which side\'s strategic vision to </p><p>support, i.e., the PM\'s peace initiative or the </p><p>president\'s more skeptical approach.  (Note:  Milinda </p><p>Moragoda told us that he was so worried about the </p><p>"politicization" of peace issues that on October 1 he </p><p>had urged former Foreign Minister Kadirgamar, a key </p><p>presidential adviser, to ensure that the president and </p><p>her supporters acted in a more bipartisan fashion.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S) Meanwhile, the stresses between the PM and the </p><p>president are also being played out in the area of </p><p>personnel.  The president, for example, recently </p><p>extended the Army and Navy commanders\' terms of office </p><p>without consultation with the GSL.  We have heard that </p><p>the president\'s actions, though legal, have been seen as </p><p>interference by many in the military, who see her as </p><p>rewarding officers she sees as her allies, while </p><p>retarding the careers of others who are not. </p><p>(Note:  This has helped spark some infighting in the </p><p>military. The Naval commander, for example, has accused </p><p>his own chief of staff of spying on him, claiming that </p><p>the latter is angry over the extension.  Adding to this </p><p>confusion is the fact that the Naval commander is known </p><p>to be pro-president, while the chief of staff is thought </p><p>to be close to the PM.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>Friction with the Police </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S) Another problematic area for the military </p><p>involves its reported tensions with the police.  Milinda </p><p>Moragoda told DCM that the relationship between the </p><p>police and the military is a tricky one.  Moragoda </p><p>explained that the genesis of the problem was the </p><p>perception by some in the police that the military took </p><p>advantage of the situation when the police were within </p><p>the Ministry of Defense.  With responsibility for the </p><p>police placed back in the Ministry of Interior upon the </p><p>installation of the new government in December 2001, </p><p>Moragoda related that the police have become more </p><p>confident in challenging military authority. </p><p>10.  (S) An example of police/military tensions coming </p><p>to a head was a police raid on a military facility in </p><p>January 2002.  In this incident, the police, acting on a </p><p>tip (apparently from someone in the military itself), </p><p>raided a safe house kept by military intelligence, </p><p>arrested six soldiers, and seized arms and ammunition. </p><p>The raid infuriated the military because the safe house </p><p>was being used by members of a top secret anti-LTTE deep </p><p>penetration unit that had its cover blown in the widely </p><p>publicized raid.  Although the soldiers have since been </p><p>released, it is still possible that a legal case against </p><p>them may be pursued by the Attorney General\'s Office. </p><p>Moragoda said the Director General of Military </p><p>Intelligence (DGMI) also remained worried that he might </p><p>be prosecuted in the matter, and, in fact, has had </p><p>charges filed against him for allegedly plotting against </p><p>the Prime Minister.  (Note:  These charges have not yet </p><p>been publicly announced and we could not confirm them. </p><p>Moragoda told us that the PM does not believe the charge </p><p>and was chagrined when he found out that the police had </p><p>filed these charges without checking with him, the </p><p>Minister of Interior or the Minister of Defense.) </p><p> </p><p>============================================= = </p><p>Most in Military said to support Peace Process </p><p>============================================= = </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S) Despite its many problems, the military as a </p><p>whole appears to support the peace process.  The Sri </p><p>Lankan military has a long history of acquiescence to </p><p>civilian authority and there is little indication of </p><p>widespread objections to the government\'s peace moves </p><p>within the force.  Jehan Perera, for example, told us </p><p>that he saw few signs that the military was seriously </p><p>angry with the government over its peace initiative, </p><p>although it was not happy to have been effectively </p><p>sidelined due to the initiative\'s success.  There were </p><p>stresses, he noted, such as those over incidents with </p><p>the LTTE (as described above), but he did not think the </p><p>GSL and the military were headed toward any sort of </p><p>break. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S) That said, recent reports indicate that there </p><p>may be some dissension.  Per Ref B, for example, Nimal </p><p>Goonetilleke (please protect), the head of the Police </p><p>Special Task Force (STF), told RSO that he had heard </p><p>that five or six high-ranking military officers (NFI) </p><p>were actively speaking out against the peace process </p><p>within their respective commands.  He speculated that </p><p>some of these officers might be angry because the peace </p><p>process was beginning to undermine illicit activities </p><p>they were engaged in.  He had no information that anyone </p><p>in the military was planning to take any sort of action </p><p>against the GSL, however.  In addition to Goonetilleke\'s </p><p>report, a Sinhala-language weekly called "Lakjana" </p><p>alleged in a September 29 article that a group of high- </p><p>level brass in the Army was planning a coup in </p><p>consultation with the president.  The article did not </p><p>provide any additional details or proof of its </p><p>assertions, but it was the first press report of its </p><p>kind that Mission has seen. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>13.  (S) The military is clearly in a difficult </p><p>position.  It feels increasingly marginalized by the </p><p>peace process, especially against the backdrop of the </p><p>central role it used to play in national affairs during </p><p>the wartime conflict.  The pressure it is facing from </p><p>the LTTE and from working within a confusing </p><p>cohabitation system is clearly demoralizing, if not </p><p>potentially debilitating. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (S) Given this situation, the military needs </p><p>careful tending by the GSL.  While it seems in no mood </p><p>to challenge the direction of the peace process, the </p><p>government needs to work with the military carefully to </p><p>ensure that it remains fully on board.  Although </p><p>obscured by the war, many of the military\'s problems </p><p>also have deep roots, which will take a serious </p><p>commitment to reform to fix.  One way the GSL is trying </p><p>to assuage the military -- and nudge it toward reform -- </p><p>is to underscore that the international community stands </p><p>ready to assist it with advice, training, and material </p><p>support.  If the government fails in the delicate task </p><p>of making the military more comfortable with its </p><p>newfound situation, there is a possibility that it could </p><p>become a wildcard element that potentially could be </p><p>taken advantage of by hard-line political elements. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (S) Just back from R+R, the Ambassador has requested </p><p>appointments with each of the service chiefs to gauge </p><p>the military leadership\'s frame of mind.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
