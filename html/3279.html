<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003370 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, XF, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN "SECRET" TALKS IN ROME: AN </p><p>EXAMPLE OF TRACK II DIPLOMACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING POL MC GARY ROBBINS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: THE MAYOR OF ROME FACILITATED SEVERAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03370  091535Z </p><p>MEETINGS BETWEEN THE ISRAELI URI SAVIR AND THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>ABU ALA LAST YEAR IN ROME.  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WAS NOT </p><p>AWARE OF THESE MEETINGS BUT IS ALSO NOT UNDULY CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THEM.  THESE MEETINGS, UNOFFICIAL IN NATURE, PRODUCED A </p><p>"ROME UNDERSTANDING", WHICH WAS EVENTUALLY REJECTED BY PM </p><p>SHARON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) POLOFF DISCUSSED WITH OFER BAVLY, THE SPOKESMAN OF THE </p><p>EMBASSY OF ISRAEL IN ROME, THE NEWS THAT BROKE IN THE ITALIAN </p><p>PRESS JULY 8 OF "SECRET" TALKS LAST YEAR BETWEEN SAVIR AND </p><p>ABU ALA IN ROME.  BAVLY SAID THE ITALIAN MEDIA OVERPLAYED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THE ROME MEETINGS. SAVIR AND ABU ALA WORKED </p><p>TOGETHER ON THE OSLO ACCORD AND ARE "GOOD FRIENDS", HE SAID. </p><p>THEY MEET FREQUENTLY IN DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE WORLD, NOT </p><p>JUST IN ROME.  THEY BOTH ASKED MAYOR VELTRONI TO ARRANGE </p><p>"SECRET" MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE, BASED ON THEIR </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN OSLO, THAT TALKS ARE MOST PRODUCTIVE WHEN MEDIA </p><p>PRESSURE IS ABSENT.  SAVIR IS A LONG-TIME FRIEND AND </p><p>CONSULTANT OF FM PERES. (NOTE: SAVIR BECAME DG OF THE ISRAELI </p><p>MFA AT THE AGE OF 39.  HE LATER BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>PERES CENTER FOR PEACE.  HE IS NOW IN PRIVATE BUSINESS AND </p><p>DIVIDES HIS TIME BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITALY.  END NOTE.)  EVEN </p><p>THOUGH PERES WAS AWARE OF THESE CONTACTS, STRESSED BAVLY, </p><p>SAVIR IS NOT AN ISRAELI GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND THUS ANY </p><p>MEETINGS HE HAS DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFICIAL CONTACT WITH </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROME </p><p>UNDERSTANDING, WHICH WAS TO BEGIN WITH A CEASE-FIRE FOLLOWED </p><p>BY MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN STATES AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENT BORDER NEGOTIATIONS, WAS REJECTED BY SHARON. </p><p>BAVLY ADDED THAT, CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME MAY EXPECT, THE </p><p>EXPOSURE OF THE SAVIR-ABU ALA ROME MEETINGS HAS RECEIVED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03370  091535Z </p><p>LITTLE COVERAGE IN THE ISRAELI PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) POLOFF ALSO SPOKE WITH PAOLO DIONISI, DEPUTY </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR FOR PM AND ACTING FM BERLUSCONI.  DIONISI </p><p>SAID THAT THE MEETINGS BETWEEN SAVIR AND ABU ALA WERE NOT </p><p>OFFICIAL IN NATURE AND THAT THE GOI WAS NEVER INFORMED OF </p><p>THEM.  ROME, ADDED DIONISI, IS A NATURAL CHOICE FOR SUCH </p><p>MEETINGS GIVEN ITS GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY TO THE MIDDLE EAST, </p><p>THE GOOD RELATIONS THAT THE MAYOR OF ROME HAS WITH BOTH SAVIR </p><p>AND ABU ALA, AND THE EASE WITH WHICH SUCH MEETINGS COULD GO </p><p>UNNOTICED IN A CITY THAT SERVES AS HOME AND TRANSIT POINT FOR </p><p>THOUSANDS OF DIPLOMATS AND PUBLIC FIGURES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: THE "SECRET" TALKS IN ROME BETWEEN SAVIR AND </p><p>ABU ALA ARE AN EXAMPLE OF TRACK II DIPLOMACY BETWEEN TWO </p><p>PEOPLE WHO WORKED WELL TOGETHER IN OSLO AND ARE REPORTEDLY </p><p>CLOSE FRIENDS.  THE MAYOR OF ROME PROTECTED THE "SECRECY" OF </p><p>THE TALKS TO HONOR SAVIR AND ABU ALA\'S WISHES, AND POSSIBLY </p><p>ALSO IN THE HOPE OF EVENTUALLY EARNING DOMESTIC AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION IF THE TALKS BORE FRUIT.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) BIO NOTE: ROME\'S MAYOR WATER VELTRONI IS A LONG-TERM </p><p>CENTER-LEFT POLITICIAN, AND SERVED AS DEPUTY PM IN THE PRODI </p><p>GOVERNMENT (1996).  HE HAS EXTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL CONTACTS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE TWO PARTICIPANTS IN THE TALKS.  HE CONTINUES TO </p><p>HOLD AMBITIONS FOR HIGH-LEVEL NATIONAL OFFICE, SHOULD ITALY\'S </p><p>CENTER-LEFT AGAIN BE IN A POSITION TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF </p><p>ITALY\'S ELECTORATE.  END BIO NOTE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03370  091535Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03370 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
