CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL BY RONALD SCHLICHER, </p><p>CHARGE.  REASONS 1.5 B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  PRESIDENT HRAWI, CITING PEACE </p><p>PROCESS AND OTHER REASONS, HAS DECIDED AGAINST </p><p>ALLOWING THE LAF TO ENTER \'AYN AL-HILWEH REFUGEE </p><p>CAMP TO ARREST THE FUGITIVE LEADER OF THE </p><p>RECENTLY DISCOVERED SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>MOVEMENT (REFTEL).  INFORMATION LEAKED FROM THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION HAS SPECIFICALLY ACCUSED SUDAN AND </p><p>OSAMA BIN LADEN OF TRAINING AND FINANCING THE </p><p>GROUP.  MURKY INFO SUGGESTS THAT THERE MAY BE A </p><p>CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ORGANIZATION AND A </p><p>SPLINTER GROUP OF THE ANO.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>"ABU MUHJEN" IN \'AYN AL-HILWEH, LAF AT GATES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) AHMED \'ABD AL-KARIM AL-SA\'ADI ("ABU </p><p>MUHJEN"), THE LEADER OF THE LEBANESE-PALESITNIAN </p><p>SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP (WHICH CALLS ITSELF </p><p>"\'ASBAT AL-ANSAR") ACCUSED OF MURDERING </p><p>"AL-AHBASH" LEADER NIZAR AL-HALABI AND OF </p><p>PLOTTING TO MURDER OTHER LEBANESE AND SYRIAN </p><p>PERSONALITIES, IS CURRENTLY IN SIDON\'S \'AYN </p><p>AL-HILWEH REFUGEE CAMP.  INDEED, ON THE DAY </p><p>FOLLOWING THE ARREST OF MOST MEMBERS OF HIS </p><p>GROUP, ABU MUHJEN GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO </p><p>"AL-SAFIR" NEWSPAPER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) HE DENIED INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDER AND </p><p>PLOTTING, DESPITE HIS COMRADES\' TELEVISED </p><p>CONFESSIONS AND RE-ENACTMENT OF THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION.  HE ALSO DENIED ANY FOREIGN </p><p>FUNDING OF HIS GROUP, AND HINTED DARKLY THAT HIS </p><p>PROBLEMS WERE SOMEHOW A ZIONIST PLOT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE LAF, WANTING TO CAP ITS SUCCESSFUL </p><p>ROUND-UP OF THE GROUP VIA THE ARREST OF ABU </p><p>MUHJEN, IS DEPLOYED AROUND \'AYN AL-HILWEH, AND </p><p>REPORTEDLY SEARCHING ALL WHO ENTER AND EXIT. </p><p>LAF COMMANDER LAHOUD ASKED PRESIDENT HRAWI FOR </p><p>PERMISSION TO ENTER THE CAMP, BUT HRAWI TOLD </p><p>CHARGE THAT HE HAS DECIDED NOT TO GIVE </p><p>PERMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>HRAWI: TIMIMG WRONG FOR LAF TO ENTER CAMPS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) HRAWI SAID THAT AN OPERATION INSIDE THE </p><p>CAMP WOULD LIKELY PRODUCE CASUALTIES AMONG THE </p><p>INNOCENT OCCUPANTS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND </p><p>CHILDREN.  HE ALSO ADDED THAT THE CURRENT </p><p>DELICACY OF PEACE-PROCESS POLITICS DID NOT NEED </p><p>THE POSSIBLE DISRUPTION THAT COULD BE ENGENDERED </p><p>BY AN OPERATION GONE WRONG.  AND, ULTIMATELY, </p><p>ADDED HRAWI, THE LAF NEEDS TO CONCENTRATE ON </p><p>PLANS FOR EVENTUAL DEPLOYMENT TO THE BORDER </p><p>INSTEAD OF ON THE REFUGEE CAMPS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>REPORTED SUDANESE AND BIN LADEN LINKS NOW PUBLIC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) REFTEL NOTED INFO THAT SAUDI FINANCIER </p><p>OF TERROR OSAMA BIN LADEN HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS </p><p>THE BANKROLLER OF THE GROUP.  ON DEC. 27, LIKELY </p><p>LAF SOURCES LEAKED TO THE MEDIA THAT THE LAF, IN </p><p>HANDING OVER THE FILES TO THE CIVIL PROSECUTORS, </p><p>HAD UNCOVERED EVIDENCE OF BIN LADEN\'S </p><p>INVOLVEMENT, ALONG WITH EVIDENCE THAT "SUDANESE </p><p>OFFICERS" HAD TRAINED THE GROUP\'S MEMBERS (WHO, </p><p>WHEN, AND WHERE WERE NOT MENTIONED). </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE SUDANESE EMBASSY (NOTABLY OMITTING </p><p>ANY REFERENCE TO REPORTED KHARTOUM RESIDENT BIN </p><p>LADEN) HAS PUBLICLY DENIED ANY CONNECTION </p><p>BETWEEN SUDAN AND THE GROUP, AND IS SUGGESTING </p><p>PRIVATELY THAT EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR ADEL </p><p>AL-KHUDARI IS SPREADING LIES ABOUT SUDAN AS PART </p><p>OF THE ONGOING BILATERAL PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>AN ANO LINK? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IN REF B WE NOTED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>AL-HALABI\'S MURDER, AN APPARENT ANO SPLINTER </p><p>GROUP ACCUSED ABU NIDAL OF ORDERING THE HIT.  WE </p><p>HAVE SEEN NO PROOF, BUT ARE HEARING RUMORS FROM </p><p>THE NORTH (FROM THE SOURCES THAT TIPPED US ON </p><p>THE BIN LADEN CONNECTION) THAT THE ARRESTED </p><p>GROUP MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DEC. 8 </p><p>MURDER IN TRIPOLI OF ANO FINANCIAL OFFICIAL </p><p>MUSTAFA \'ATTOUR, WHO WAS GUNNED DOWN IN MUCH THE </p><p>SAME FASHION AS AL-HALABI. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE OTHER </p><p>RUMORS, AGAIN WITH NO PROOF OFFERED, THAT ABU </p><p>MUHJEN WORKS FOR PLO DISSIDENT MUNIR AL-MUQDAH, </p><p>WHO CURRENTLY IS THE STRONG MAN IN \'AYN </p><p>AL-HILWEH. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT: WE WILL WATCH CAREFULLY FOR </p><p>CLARIFYING INFORMATION, BUT NOTE THAT, IN THE </p><p>HOTHOUSE REJECTIONIST POLITICS OF \'AYN </p><p>AL-HILWEH, VIRTUALLY ANY COMBINATION OF </p><p>LOYALTIES AND ALLEGIANCES IS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHLICHER </p><p></p></div>
