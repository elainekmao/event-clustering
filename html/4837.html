<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 002341 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  12-23-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, EAID, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Peace Process Update:  Reports of ceasefire </p><p>violations spike down; One-year milestone for process </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 2337, and previous (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process reviews </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>- Reports of ceasefire violations spike way down </p><p> </p><p>- Criticism of government and Norwegians over import of </p><p>radio equipment for LTTE continues to flare </p><p> </p><p>- GSL-LTTE meeting in London canceled, but January talks </p><p>in Bangkok still on </p><p> </p><p>- Although tension in party does not abate, Muslim </p><p>leader Rauf Hakeem seems back on top -- for now </p><p> </p><p>- The Flavor of the Peace Process:  December 24 marks </p><p>one-year milestone </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>Reported Violations Spike Down </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) has </p><p>announced that reported violations of the February </p><p>ceasefire accord have spiked way down.  The Norwegian- </p><p>run SLMM stated that there had been a total of 146 </p><p>reports in November of which 33 were against the Sri </p><p>Lankan government and 113 against the Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  The November total compares with </p><p>the average of about 300-400 alleged violations reported </p><p>to the SLMM during each of the previous months.  Of the </p><p>113 reported violations attributed to the LTTE, the SLMM </p><p>announced that 38 involved the forcible recruitment of </p><p>children for the Tigers\' armed forces.  The SLMM </p><p>continued to investigate these reports, as well as a </p><p>number of others involving the LTTE.  In terms of the 33 </p><p>reports involving the GSL, the SLMM had investigated </p><p>them and determined that none were violations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) (((Note:  An important ceasefire-related issue </p><p>under in-depth discussion between the two sides lately </p><p>involves the GSL military\'s "high security zones" in the </p><p>north/east, and their impact on the local populace. </p><p>Late last week, the GSL handed over a proposal regarding </p><p>high security zone adjustments to the SLMM.  This </p><p>proposal is being provided to the LTTE for review.))) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  The latest news re reported violations </p><p>is a positive development.  At this point, both sides </p><p>seem to be honoring the ceasefire accord more than at </p><p>any point since it was signed in February.  The bad news </p><p>is that the LTTE still appears to be involved in the </p><p>forcible recruitment of children.  UNICEF is working </p><p>with the LTTE on this issue and reports that the group </p><p>is being cooperative, but that much progress needs to be </p><p>made.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>======================================== </p><p>Critics Lash Out over Equipment for LTTE </p><p>======================================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Critics continue to lash out at the GSL and </p><p>the Norwegian facilitators over the recent import of </p><p>radio equipment for the LTTE.  (Note:  At the </p><p>government\'s request, the Norwegian Embassy imported </p><p>LTTE-purchased radio equipment in a diplomatic </p><p>consignment.  After the equipment was handed over to the </p><p>GSL, the equipment was sent to the LTTE\'s "Voice of the </p><p>Tigers\'" radio station -- See Reftel.)  In a December 20 </p><p>press briefing, a People\'s Alliance (PA) spokesman </p><p>accused the GSL of "treason," asserting that the </p><p>government should not have allowed the equipment to be </p><p>brought in the country.  In addition, spokesmen for the </p><p>radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party have </p><p>denounced the Norwegian role, claiming that the GoN had </p><p>abused its diplomatic status by allowing the equipment </p><p>to be brought in duty free.  The JVP is planning to hold </p><p>a demonstration in front of the Norwegian Embassy late </p><p>December 23. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  This issue does not seem to be dying. </p><p>While emanating from the usual anti-peace process </p><p>sources, the attacks on the Norwegians are </p><p>getting increasingly vitriolic.  In particular, </p><p>Norwegian Ambassador Jon Westborg has taken some harsh </p><p>hits, with many of the attacks taking personal aim at </p><p>him.  Despite the fact that it asked the GoN to become </p><p>involved in the first place, the government has not </p><p>rushed in to defend the Norwegians, as of yet. </p><p>Addressing this point, Tomas Stangeland, poloff at the </p><p>Norwegian Embassy, told us today that he thought the </p><p>government would issue a statement clarifying the matter </p><p>soon.  He noted that it was difficult for the GoN to say </p><p>anything in its defense until the GSL explained its key </p><p>role in public.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>Meeting in London Canceled </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) A meeting between G.L. Peiris, a senior </p><p>government minister, and Anton Balasingham, the chief </p><p>negotiator for the LTTE, was canceled last week.  The </p><p>meeting was supposed to take place in London on </p><p>December 18, but Balasingham canceled at the last minute </p><p>for "health" reasons.  Tomas Stangeland of the Norwegian </p><p>Embassy told us it was indeed possible that Balasingham </p><p>was ill.  (Note:  Balasingham has had very serious </p><p>health problems for years.)  According to Stangeland, </p><p>however, it also seemed a real possibility that </p><p>Balasingham was upset with a recent letter from the </p><p>Japanese government to the LTTE reviewing how the GoJ </p><p>disburses development assistance.  Stangeland said the </p><p>GoJ letter apparently made it clear that funding had to </p><p>go to the GSL first -- and only then out to projects in </p><p>LTTE-controlled areas.  (Note:  The LTTE believes that </p><p>it should control the funding to the full extent </p><p>possible.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  The cancellation of the London meeting </p><p>was unfortunate -- Stangeland said the meeting would </p><p>have been useful in mapping out next steps in the peace </p><p>process.  That said, despite continued discussion about </p><p>the nature of aid disbursements, the fourth session of </p><p>GSL-LTTE talks slated to take place in Thailand from </p><p>January 6-9 still seems to be on track.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>=================================== </p><p>Hakeem Seems Back on Top -- For Now </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The saga involving splits in the Sri Lanka </p><p>Muslim Congress (SLMC) shows little sign of abating </p><p>soon.  Both party leader (and GSL minister) Rauf Hakeem </p><p>and his SLMC opponents continue to hit out at each other </p><p>in almost daily attacks.  Hakeem insists that he has </p><p>suspended the rebels from party activities and he is </p><p>threatening to expel them altogether if they do not toe </p><p>the line.  In the meantime, the rebels assert that </p><p>Hakeem has been removed as leader and expelled from the </p><p>party.  Of late, Hakeem appears to be gaining the edge </p><p>in the fight.  On December 13, he won a court case, </p><p>which turned down a demand from the rebels that he be </p><p>enjoined from acting as party leader.  In addition, </p><p>Hakeem seems to be having some success on the stump in </p><p>uniting the rest of the SLMC against the rebels.  While </p><p>the two sides remain at loggerheads, various efforts are </p><p>under way to mediate the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT:  Hakeem has led an effective legal and </p><p>political counterattack against his SLMC opponents, so </p><p>far.  He seems animated and less aloof, which has helped </p><p>him as he fights for his political life.  His grip on </p><p>power still seems fragile, however, and it is not clear </p><p>how long he can keep the initiative.  Given the nasty, </p><p>internecine struggle, it is also not clear whether </p><p>Hakeem will be present at the fourth session of GSL-LTTE </p><p>talks.  (Note:  Hakeem was present throughout the first </p><p>two rounds as a member of the government\'s team, but had </p><p>to leave suddenly in the middle of the third session in </p><p>early December because of his political troubles back </p><p>home.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>================== </p><p>One-Year Milestone </p><p>================== </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) The peace process is about to celebrate its </p><p>one-year anniversary.  December 24 will mark one-year </p><p>since the start of the process.  (Note:  At midnight on </p><p>December 24, 2001, both sides joined in unilateral, </p><p>ceasefires renewable on a month-by-month basis.  In </p><p>February 2002, both sides reached agreement on the </p><p>ceasefire accord now in place.)  With much of the </p><p>country effectively shutting down for the holiday </p><p>season, few festivities marking the one-year anniversary </p><p>of the process are planned, although some churches are </p><p>planning to ring their bells in a salute to the </p><p>occasion.  Neither the government, the LTTE nor the </p><p>Norwegian facilitators are planning any official </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Thanks to the peace process, there </p><p>have not been any major incidents of violence in Sri </p><p>Lanka in the past year.  This is quite a remarkable </p><p>achievement, given the fact that in previous years over </p><p>66,000 thousand people were killed on the battlefield or </p><p>in LTTE-sponsored terrorist attacks.  This iteration of </p><p>the peace process is already the longest break in </p><p>violence the country has experienced by far since the </p><p>conflict began in 1983.  (Note:  The longest cessation </p><p>of hostilities before the current process was in 1994-95 </p><p>and lasted about six months.  Breaks in the fighting in </p><p>1987, 1990, and 2000-01 each lasted only a handful of </p><p>months.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
