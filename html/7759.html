<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001221 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, PGOV, CA, Narcotics </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA:  PRIME MINISTER SUGGESTS HE MIGHT MOVE </p><p>FORWARD WITH MARIJUANA DECRIMINALIZATION LEGISLATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora. Reason 1.5D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) During an address at a Liberal Party fund raiser in </p><p>Toronto on April 29, Prime Minster Jean Chretien stated that </p><p>his government plans to introduce legislation that would </p><p>decriminalize the possession of "small amounts" of marijuana. </p><p>Chretien stated that the proposed bill would eliminate </p><p>criminal penalties for simple possession by individuals but </p><p>would be accompanied by tougher criminal provisions against </p><p>those who grow and traffic marijuana.  According to press </p><p>coverage, the bill which has not yet been submitted to </p><p>Canada\'s Cabinet, might be passed to Parliament as early as </p><p>June. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Prime Minster\'s statement followed comments made </p><p>by Minister of Justice Martin Cauchon to the Ambassador </p><p>earlier in the month that the long expected marijuana </p><p>decriminalization law would in actuality strengthen the </p><p>government\'s ability to inhibit the growth, processing, </p><p>trafficking and use of marijuana in Canada.  According to </p><p>Cauchon, the new law would allow for stiffer criminal </p><p>penalties for the growing and trafficking of marijuana, and </p><p>enable national and local law enforcement resources to </p><p>concentrate their efforts to detect, arrest and prosecute </p><p>growers and smugglers/traffickers.  Cauchon also stated that </p><p>the new law would decongest local and provincial courts now </p><p>"overcrowded" with minor possession cases.  He also said that </p><p>marijuana usage would be discouraged through enforced </p><p>"ticketing" and fining of users. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Though Canadian officials are holding the long </p><p>referred to decriminalization legislation close to the chest, </p><p>it is believed that it reflects the findings and </p><p>recommendations set forth in a report of the Senate Special </p><p>Committee on Illegal Drugs issued in September 2002.  Though </p><p>this committee\'s report had no legislative standing, it did </p><p>state that (quote) when used in moderation, cannabis in </p><p>itself poses very little danger to users and to society as a </p><p>whole.... (and that) even if cannabis were to have serious </p><p>harmful effects, one would have to question the relevance of </p><p>using the criminal law to limit these effects. (unquote)  It </p><p>recommended the creation of a position of a National Advisor </p><p>on Psychoactive Substances and Dependency within the Prime </p><p>Minster\'s  Privy Council and that more be done to coordinate </p><p>drug control and abuse policies and programs among local, </p><p>provincial and national authorities. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The Prime Minster\'s fund raiser comments may have </p><p>been premature, poorly managed, or both.  On May 6, Canada\'s </p><p>Supreme Court will begin hearing appeals made against three </p><p>provincial court decisions  declaring Canada\'s current </p><p>marijuana possession law unconstitutional.  According to one </p><p>knowledgeable University of Ottawa law professor and </p><p>political consultant who favors the decriminalization of </p><p>marijuana, should Canada\'s Supreme Court Justices strike down </p><p>Canada\'s current marijuana law, there would be little need </p><p>for the Chretien government to introduce, what would then be </p><p>more restrictive, decriminalization legislation.  Instead, by </p><p>just holding tight for the moment, the Government could avoid </p><p>a political fight and instead concentrate on other </p><p>counternarcotics issues such as strengthening penalties for </p><p>growers and traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  Chretien and his government are no doubt </p><p>searching for  ways to manage the expected criticism that </p><p>would follow the proposed decriminalization of marijuana. </p><p>Post has made it clear that Washington is watching the </p><p>decriminalization debate with concern and that should Canada </p><p>weaken its stand against drugs -- even if that weakening is </p><p>only a perception -- cross border flow of people and goods </p><p>from Canada would likely come under increased scrutiny. </p><p>Whether Chretien\'s April 29 comments were calculated or a </p><p>slip of the tongue, we are using every opportunity to </p><p>emphasize to our Canadian friends that any action that </p><p>lessens Canada\'s counternarcotics efforts will be viewed with </p><p>utmost concern. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
