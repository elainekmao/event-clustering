<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 004444 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR, EUR/PD, AND EUR/EEA -KALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IZ, KPAO, OPRC, PREL, KPAO, OPRC, PREL, VT, VTIZ </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE AND THE ROADMAP FOR IRAQ PUBLIC DIPLOMACY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.

(C) SUMMARY:  THE HOLY SEE PRESENTS DISTINCTIVE CHALLENGES </p><p>AND OPPORTUNITIES IN REGARD TO IRAQ PUBLIC DIPLOMACY.  UNLIKE </p><p>MOST POSTS, OUR "PUBLIC" WITHIN THE VATICAN IS LIMITED, BUT </p><p>THE PUBLIC REACH OF THE VATICAN IS TRULY GLOBAL AND AMONG THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04444  01 OF 02  130613Z </p><p>MOST IMPORTANT VOICES WE CAN SEEK TO INFLUENCE.  AS WE HAVE </p><p>RECENTLY REPORTED (REFS B AND C), THE HOLY SEE IS CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THE IRAQI REGIME, BUT OPPOSED TO MILITARY ACTION BASED </p><p>ON THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE AT THIS TIME.  DESPITE ITS </p><p>TRADITIONAL OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF FORCE, THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER DID LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF MILITARY </p><p>ACTION, BUT ONLY AFTER CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE </p><p>IRAQI PEOPLE THE REGION, AND GLOBAL STABILITY, AND ONLY </p><p>WITHIN A U.N. FRAMEWORK.  OUR FIRST PUBLIC DIPLOMACY </p><p>CHALLENGE IS THEREFORE TO MAKE OUR CASE FOR ACTION TO THE </p><p>POPE AND SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MAKING OUR CASE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE HOLY SEE RECOGNIZES THE SECURITY RISK POSED BY </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AND THE THREATS SADDAM POSES TO </p><p>HIS PEOPLE AND THE REGION.  THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE CONVINCED </p><p>OF THE NATURE OF SADDAM\'S CHARACTER, HIS HISTORY IN POWER, OR </p><p>THE POTENTIAL RISKS THAT HE POSES.  WHAT HAS BEEN LACKING, </p><p>FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S PERSPECTIVE, BASED ON RECENT DISCUSSIONS </p><p>AND PRESENTATIONS BY SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS, IS THE </p><p>FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-- A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY IRAQ CANNOT BE CONTAINED </p><p>SHORT OF DIRECT MILITARY ACTION; </p><p> </p><p>-- COMPELLING JUSTIFICATION AS TO WHY THE THREAT FROM IRAQ IS </p><p>GREATER TODAY THAN DURING THE PAST SO THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE </p><p>IMMEDIATE ACTION; </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04444  01 OF 02  130613Z </p><p> </p><p>-- A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS AND POTENTIAL TO </p><p>THE IRAQI PEOPLE, THE REGION, AND GLOBAL STABILITY OF BOTH </p><p>TAKING ACTION VERSUS NOT TAKING ACTION (THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES </p><p>THERE IS A GREAT RISK THAT MILITARY ACTION IN THE REGION </p><p>COULD LEAD TO A MUCH LARGER CONFLAGRATION THAT COULD DRAW </p><p>ISRAEL INTO WAR IN WAYS THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY </p><p>DEVASTATING); </p><p> </p><p>-- A CONVINCING CASE THAT THE WORLD COMMUNITY HAS EXHAUSTED </p><p>ALL OPTIONS AND MUST ACT TO AVERT A GREATER CALAMITY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ADDRESSING THE JUST WAR ISSUE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  ULTIMATELY, THE HOLY SEE\'S PUBLIC STANCE ON AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO IRAQ -- IN PARTICULAR WHETHER IT </p><p>WILL EITHER ACQUIESCE IN OR SUPPORT MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ </p><p>-- WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER SUCH A RESPONSE MEETS THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S JUST WAR DOCTRINE AS ENUNCIATED IN THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CATECHISM.  TO THE EXTENT THAT U.S. DIPLOMATIC AND PUBLIC </p><p>DIPLOMACY EFFORTS CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT SUCH ACTION MEETS </p><p>THE JUST WAR CRITERIA, THE PROSPECTS FOR VATICAN </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE NEED FOR ACTION WILL BE GREATER.  REF D </p><p>OUTLINES THE JUST WAR DOCTRINE AND HIGHLIGHTS THE VALUE OF </p><p>WORKING WITH THE HOLY SEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO BUILD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR OUR CASE AGAINST IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>4.

THE HOLY SEE PREFERS DIALOGUE AND ENGAGEMENT </p><p>WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND CLEARLY WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO SEE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PURSUE OTHER FORMS OF </p><p>PRESSURE MORE EXHAUSTIVELY BEFORE MOVING TO A MILITARY OPTION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>INFLUENCING THE HOLY SEE\'S PUBLIC POSITION </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE HOLY SEE NATURALLY VIEWS ITS ROLE AS THAT OF AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL VOICE FOR PEACE AND RECONCILIATION AND A </p><p>"BUILDER OF BRIDGES" BETWEEN PEOPLES.  IN ADDITION, THE POPE </p><p>HAS LABORED HARD TO AVOID A GLOBAL DRIFT TOWARD A "CLASH OF </p><p>CIVILIZATIONS."  THIS CONCERN NOT ONLY REFLECTS THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S TRADITIONAL CONCERN FOR THE PHYSICAL SAFETY OF </p><p>CATHOLICS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE A MINORITY, BUT ALSO </p><p>ITS ROLE AS A MORAL AND SPIRITUAL  VOICE FOR MANKIND.  AS A </p><p>FIRST STEP IN BUILDING SUPPORT WITHIN THE HOLY SEE, WE </p><p>REITERATE OUR REQUEST FOR SENIOR LEVEL BRIEFINGS THE </p><p>RATIONALE FOR ACTION, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ACTION ON THE </p><p>REGION, AND PROSPECTS FOR STABILITY AFTER MILITARY ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN THE SAME WAY THE USG DEVELOPED A MUTUALLY </p><p>BENEFICIAL DIALOGUE WITH POPE JOHN PAUL II DURING THE COLD </p><p>WAR, POST BELIEVES A SIMILAR DIALOGUE ON THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RESPONSE TO TERRORISM WOULD OFFER SIMILAR MUTUAL BENEFITS. </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL BRIEFINGS WOULD UNDERSCORE OUR DEEP REFLECTION ON </p><p>THE MATTER AND LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR FURTHER POSITIVE </p><p>DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04444  02 OF 02  130613Z </p><p>7. (C) BEYOND SUCH DIRECT USG ENGAGEMENT, U.S. EXPERTS ON </p><p>JUST WAR SUCH AS MICHAEL NOVAK ALREADY HAVE A STRONG </p><p>REPUTATION WITHIN THE HOLY SEE.  A PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN </p><p>SHOULD SEEK TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR VIEWS AND PERHAPS EVEN SOLICIT </p><p>THEM AS SPEAKERS AND INTERLOCUTORS FOR THE EMBASSY AND HOLY </p><p>SEE.  IN ADDITION, PROMINENT FOREIGN POLICY AUTHORITIES SUCH </p><p>AS HENRY KISSINGER AND ZBIGNIEW BREZEZINSKI HAVE INDEPENDENT </p><p>ACCESS TO THE HOLY SEE AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO SHARE </p><p>THEIR VIEWS ON IRAQ AND THE NEED TO RESPOND TO TERRORISM </p><p>DIRECTLY. </p><p> </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA04444 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
