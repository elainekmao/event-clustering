<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000473 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PD LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, WREINCKENS; </p><p>SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Independent English daily wonders whether "war on Iraq </p><p>[will] free US from terrorists threat." </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline "Will war on Iraq free US from </p><p>terrorists threat?, the ISLAND (opposition English daily, </p><p>islandwide circulation) wrote on 3/21: </p><p> </p><p>The question arises whether elimination of the Saddam </p><p>Hussein regime will rid America and European nations from </p><p>the threat of terrorism.  The war in Afghanistan and </p><p>driving out the Taleban regime, have not eliminated the Al </p><p>Queda and its leader bin Laden. Even US intelligence </p><p>agencies such as the CIA and FBI have said openly that </p><p>America will not be free of terrorist attacks. Much </p><p>progress has been made in the Global War on Terrorism and </p><p>President Bush has been receiving a good response to his </p><p>appeal from most countries, including many Islamic states. </p><p>But it is evident that that he is jeopardising his global </p><p>effort on terrorism with this war which has proven to be </p><p>much unpopular. </p><p> </p><p>2. Government-owned English daily ponders local fallout, </p><p>praises government\'s preparations. </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline "Tiding over emergencies," the DAILY </p><p>NEWS (government-owned English daily, islandwide </p><p>circulation) wrote on 3/21: </p><p> </p><p>With tensions further intensifying in the Gulf, many a </p><p>Lankan heart is going out to the numerous local migrant </p><p>workers in the Middle East who would now have to grapple </p><p>with a whole host of imponderables.  Apparently, not many </p><p>Lankans are employed in Iraq itself but a considerable </p><p>number of them are employed in Saudi Arabia and other </p><p>neighbouring countries which could be expected to be </p><p>affected by a war in the Gulf.  Their safety should be a </p><p>prime concern for the State and for the people of this </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>Fortunately, the Government has taken cognizance of this </p><p>requirement.  ... every possible step has been taken to </p><p>evacuate some 500,000 Lankan expatriate workers in the </p><p>Middle East, to "safe areas" with the help of Lankan </p><p>missions in the region.... </p><p> </p><p>Besides the provision of these facilities and security </p><p>measures, evacuation plans should also be envisaged for </p><p>these workers in the event of the war having grave </p><p>spillover effects.  It would be best for the State to be </p><p>prepared for serious humanitarian crises although we hope </p><p>fervently that there would be no prolonged suffering for </p><p>anyone. </p><p> </p><p>Food shortages need to be anticipated and the necessary </p><p>measures taken to ensure that essential commodities are </p><p>stocked and rationed, if necessary.  We hope the new </p><p>regulations would ensure the fulfilment of these conditions </p><p>and provide for the efficient running of local food supply </p><p>systems. </p><p> </p><p>There is every possibility of unscrupulous traders cashing- </p><p>in on situations of this kind to ensure self-enrichment. </p><p>Times of hardship invariably turn out to be opportunities </p><p>for hoarding and for earning a fast buck by the more </p><p>parasitic of businessmen.  It is up to the authorities to </p><p>guard against such dangers. </p><p> </p><p>3. Independent Sinhala daily says that Saddam\'s imprudence </p><p>in 1990 is being matched by American imprudence today. </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline "Now showing!" DIVAINA (opposition </p><p>Sinhala daily) wrote on 3/21: </p><p> </p><p>The hi tech war movie on worldwide TV channels.  This is </p><p>about a war initiated by a undisciplined and stubborn war- </p><p>loving man to manipulate another of the same ilk. </p><p> </p><p>George W. has planned this war for a long time and Saddam </p><p>looks happy to receive it. </p><p> </p><p>Using the same bull-in-a-China-shop approached that it </p><p>followed in Vietnam decades ago, and in Afghanistan a year </p><p>ago, the US is putting the whole world in grave danger.... </p><p>And Saddam is ready....  For each missile that Bush sends, </p><p>Saddam will reply with a missile of smallpox, yellow fever, </p><p>etc.  We have constantly been aware of this and have often </p><p>expressed our views.... </p><p> </p><p>We have absolutely no regard for Saddam, who is a bloody </p><p>dictator who controls millions of people in Iraq.  But if </p><p>Bush is using this situation to take control of Iraq\'s oil </p><p>reserves, or to realize some other hidden objective, we </p><p>condemn that, too </p><p> </p><p>One must be wise enough to understand the limits of one\'s </p><p>freedom.  Saddam didn\'t show prudence in 1990 when Iraq </p><p>invaded Kuwait.  George B. isn\'t showing it today. </p><p> </p><p>4. Independent Sinhala daily suggests "Let\'s be prepare for </p><p>the impact of the war." </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline "Let\'s be prepared for the impact of </p><p>war" LANKADEEPA (independent Sinhala daily) wrote on 3/21: </p><p>No one can say how and when the war will be over, but one </p><p>thing is clear:  billions of people -- in Iraq and other </p><p>developing countries -- will face numerous difficulties. </p><p>To this the Sri Lankan government should give priority.  It </p><p>is urgent and vital. </p><p> </p><p>Ministers of Labor and of Consumer affairs have spoken of </p><p>migrant workers and consumer items and food and petroleum. </p><p>But consistent attention is vital, as almost everything in </p><p>our country loses its fizz after some time. </p><p> </p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans work in the Middle </p><p>East.  They earn vital foreign exchange for us.  If that is </p><p>hampered, we will lose the forex and, also, unemployment in </p><p>the country will increase significantly.... </p><p> </p><p>Who can assure harmony in foreign employment, forex, fuel </p><p>prices, food supply?  ... a short-term program is urgently </p><p>needed; the government should start something ASAP! </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
