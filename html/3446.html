<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002326 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, PGOV, EPET, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LETTER FROM CHEVRON NIGERIA: ESCRAVOS </p><p>OCCUPATION ENDS </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Lagos 1460 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Ambassador Jeter received the following letter from </p><p>Chevron Nigeria Limited, signifying the end of the </p><p>occupation of Chevron\'s Escravos storage facility by </p><p>Ugborodo women in Delta State: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>END OF OCCUPATION OF ESCRAVOS TANK FARM BY UGBORODO WOMEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=Salutations </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We are happy to inform you of the peaceful resolution of </p><p>the occupation of our Escravos Tank Farm and Terminal by </p><p>protesting women from the Ugborodo communities.  The women </p><p>have vacated the facility and returned to their various </p><p>homes following the signing of a Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding (MOU) by our management and leaders of the </p><p>communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Throughout the period of occupation, there was no injury </p><p>to, or loss of life of, any of our workforce, including the </p><p>American nationals.  Normalcy is gradually returning to our </p><p>Escravos operations and we can once again guarantee a </p><p>favorable working environment, devoid of fear and </p><p>harassment, for our employees and contractors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We appreciate your show of concern and interest in our </p><p>affairs during the occupation and would like to re-assure </p><p>you of our paramount commitment to safe operations, </p><p>especially the safety of our people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Complimentary Close, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J.R. Pryor </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Comment: This takeover falls on the heels of an </p><p>April situation in Escravos, during which twenty-five local </p><p>youths held forty Chevron Texaco employees hostage. The </p><p>situation was resolved without incident and despite the </p><p>peaceful resolution of this most recent takeover, Chevron </p><p>still faces many challenges to operating business as usual. </p><p>There are unconfirmed news reports of yet another potential </p><p>interruption to Chevron\'s operations as apparently </p><p>inhabitants of villages that did not participate in the </p><p>recent agreement may be clamoring for equal treatment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Women and children seem to be the new wave of </p><p>protestors in the Delta. Situations like these will be </p><p>increasingly difficult for oil companies to counteract. </p><p>Inevitably, production will be impacted.  Throughout the </p><p>eleven-day ordeal, Chevron lost nearly 300,000 barrels of </p><p>oil a day.  If this trend holds, a serious threat may be </p><p>posed to Nigeria\'s number one source of foreign earnings. </p><p>The silver lining in all of these developments, if there </p><p>can be one at all, is that no one was hurt nor does there </p><p>appear to be an intent to physically harm any of the oil </p><p>companies\' personnel, Nigerian or expatriate. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
