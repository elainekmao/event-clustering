Law Society of Zimbabwe (LSZ) President Sternford Moyo </p><p>       and LSZ Executive Secretary Wilbert Mapombere were released </p><p>       from police custody on June 5 after spending 48 hours in </p><p>       custody on charges of plotting to overthrow the government </p><p>       of Robert Mugabe.  The two have been ordered to appear at </p><p>       the Harare Magistrates\' Court on June 6 to be formally </p><p>       charged for contravening a section of the newly enacted </p><p>       Public Order and Security Act (POSA). </p><p> </p><p>    2.   Moyo and Mapombere are alleged to have written letters </p><p>       to the British High Commission in Harare and the opposition </p><p>       Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), calling for the </p><p>       suspension of crisis talks between the opposition MDC and </p><p>       Mugabe\'s ruling ZANU PF party.  The government also accused </p><p>       Moyo and Mapombere of writing letters in support of mass </p><p>       action.  The two men have denied the charges as "fabricated </p><p>       and without any legal foundation." </p><p> </p><p>    2.   Meanwhile, the High Court of Zimbabwe ruled that Moyo </p><p>        and Mapombere\'s arrest was lawful.  The ruling by Judge </p><p>        President Justice Garwe in Harare yesterday dismissed an </p><p>        application by the two lawyers that sought to have the </p><p>        arrest and detention declared unlawful. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
