<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002846 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL/IL AND EUR/WE </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/BRUMFIELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ECON, PGOV, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  Labor Rights Referendum Fails Over Low Turnout, </p><p>Relieving All Quarters </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: A year-long political drama over an obscure but </p><p>symbolically important provision of Italian labor law closed </p><p>with a whimper on June 16, when a national referendum on the </p><p>provision drew only a quarter of registered voters and </p><p>failed to qualify as valid.  The dispute over the provision, </p><p>which governs compensation for workers who are improperly </p><p>dismissed, was always more about politics than substance. </p><p>The referendum confirmed what many observers had already </p><p>concluded: that most Italians did not view the provision as </p><p>an inviolable right affording them important protections. </p><p>The government, mainstream opposition and two of the three </p><p>labor confederations have found different vehicles to </p><p>develop pragmatic consensus on much-needed reforms to </p><p>Italy\'s rigid labor markets.  All quarters hope the dispute </p><p>over Article 18 will soon quietly fade from view.  The </p><p>referendum served its most useful function beforehand, in </p><p>stimulating progress on a package of meaningful labor market </p><p>reforms expected to enter into force in the fall.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The referendum (almost) no one wanted. </p><p> </p><p>2. On June 15-16, Italians voted on a proposal to broaden </p><p>coverage of a labor law provision that was a major locus for </p><p>political confrontation in 2002.  The provision, Article 18 </p><p>of the worker\'s statute, governs employees\' right to </p><p>reinstatement or compensation if they are improperly fired. </p><p>The referendum called for extending the provision to all </p><p>Italian workers; currently, small enterprises with 15 </p><p>employees or less (over 80 percent of the Italian workforce) </p><p>are not bound by Article 18\'s provisions.  It was held on </p><p>the initiative of the far-left Communist Renewal (RC) party </p><p>and FIOM, the biggest, most radical metalworkers union. </p><p>FIOM and its parent confederation, CGIL, collected most of </p><p>the signatures required to schedule the referendum. </p><p> </p><p>3. Although those who turned out voted overwhelmingly in </p><p>favor of the provision (more than 85 percent), most Italians </p><p>chose not to vote.  Less than 26 percent of the electorate </p><p>participated, well below the 50 percent-plus-one vote </p><p>required to validate the results.  After a year of protests </p><p>and political skirmishes over the issue, the public lost </p><p>interest in ideological slogans on vested rights and in </p><p>personal competition between leaders.  Moreover, few workers </p><p>considered Article 18 a crucial protective measure, </p><p>especially in the small companies, for which flexibility is </p><p>the key for competitiveness, that were the referendum\'s </p><p>target.  Parliament also passed a meaty labor market reform </p><p>package, with the support or acquiescence of most of the </p><p>social partners, after the constitutional court approved the </p><p>referendum in January. </p><p> </p><p>4. Almost all political parties encouraged voters to stay </p><p>home and abstain; only Communist Renewal actively campaigned </p><p>in favor.  A committee organized by members of PM </p><p>Berlusconi\'s Forza Italia party and supported by Labor </p><p>Minister Maroni worked just as hard on a "no" campaign; </p><p>Italian cities were carpeted with the two campaigns\' </p><p>respective posters.   Two of the three major union </p><p>confederations, CISL and UIL, also favored abstention, </p><p>characterizing the referendum as the wrong vehicle </p><p>addressing the wrong issue.  Even CGIL\'s leader, Guglielmo </p><p>Epifani, paired his call for a \'yes\' vote with a new reform </p><p>proposal, based on a reimbursement system, and suggested </p><p>that the referendum was a mistake.  Epifani sought to </p><p>balance a divided membership and find a way to reflect </p><p>FIOM\'s central role in collecting signatures for the </p><p>referendum, as well as the large portion of the </p><p>confederation\'s membership who supported the campaign in </p><p>favor of Article 18 promoted by Epifani\'s predecessor, </p><p>Sergio Cofferati.  In short, most of the major participants </p><p>in labor-management relations and labor market reform will </p><p>breath easier now that the referendum has been defeated. </p><p> </p><p>.was prompted by the political fight everyone sought </p><p> </p><p>5.  Article 18\'s transformation from political lightning rod </p><p>to afterthought provided a great window into Italian </p><p>political culture and calculus.  After Berlusconi\'s </p><p>resounding victory in the 2001 elections, the center-left </p><p>was hamstrung by the lack of a credible political platform </p><p>and riven by disputes among its constituent parties and </p><p>their leaders; it badly needed an issue around which it </p><p>could rally the faithful and sharpen differences with the </p><p>new governing coalition.  For its part, the government </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>announced its intention to abandon the social partnership </p><p>called `concertazione\' - a time-honored Italian form of </p><p>consensus-building that afforded unions substantial roles in </p><p>social and economic policymaking.  Both government and </p><p>opposition (with prompting from CGIL, which decided to use </p><p>the issue to galvanize opposition to the Berlusconi </p><p>coalition) settled on revisions to Article 18 as the ideal </p><p>vehicle to address their respective objectives. </p><p> </p><p>6. Italy\'s trade union confederations were threatened by </p><p>their potential loss of influence, and a Cofferti-led CGIL </p><p>decided to use the confederation\'s organizational talents </p><p>and influence on public opinion to lead an ideological </p><p>campaign against the government based on the defense of </p><p>Article 18 -- an approach initially supported by the other </p><p>two major confederations as well.  Cofferati\'s approach </p><p>dovetailed nicely with that of Communist Renewal, which </p><p>tried to use the Article 18 debate to peel away supporters </p><p>disgruntled by the center-left\'s perennial infighting. </p><p> </p><p>7. When the Berlusconi government agreed in July 2002 to </p><p>seek broad agreement on social and economic policy via a </p><p>return to "concertazione," the more centrist-minded CISL and </p><p>UIL confederations abandoned the campaign against Article 18 </p><p>and agreed to support an experimental suspension of its </p><p>provisions for some workers.  Today, thanks to a new CGIL </p><p>leadership and the new strength of the opposition, the </p><p>reform of labor market is largely considered a priority for </p><p>which both sides are proposing more pragmatic solutions to </p><p>promote job creation and new kinds of flexibility and social </p><p>security. </p><p> </p><p>8. The recent electoral success of the mainstream center- </p><p>left and the electorate\'s apparent impatience with the lack </p><p>of substantial reforms and improvements in Italy\'s economic </p><p>performance have boosted efforts to develop a shared </p><p>pragmatic approach to labor market reform.  A proposed </p><p>reform of Article 18, based on arbitration and financial </p><p>compensation, is under discussion within the center-left, </p><p>linked to the request for a new the Statute to provide the </p><p>new categories of nontraditional, "atypical" workers with </p><p>the types of rights and benefits, including public pension </p><p>and social services, enjoyed by classic full-time employees. </p><p>A compromise over this additional reform proposal could </p><p>finally resolve an issue that until now has generated far </p><p>more theatrics than results. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02846 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
