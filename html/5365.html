<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000706 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR EDSON, QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETRD, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PRESSES DEPUTY PM ON ECONOMIC REFORM, </p><p>RAISES FTA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) STATE 22328 </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 22326 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR W. ROBERT PEARSON. REASON: 1.5(B, D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador told Deputy Prime Minister Sener </p><p>January 28 that Turkey was now seriously off-track on its IMF </p><p>program, that USG assistance was conditioned on both military </p><p>cooperation and implementation of the reform program, and </p><p>that it would be impossible for the USG to agree to </p><p>assistance until and unless Turkey completed the Fourth IMF </p><p>review.  Ambassador urged the GOT to move quickly to comply </p><p>with the program and reassure markets.  Sener said the </p><p>government was committed to maintaining macroeconomic </p><p>balances and, despite difficulties, would meet the primary </p><p>surplus target of 6.5 percent of GNP.  He predicted that the </p><p>January 28-29 High Planning Council meeting would resolve the </p><p>budgetary issues for the year.  In his view, the January 25 </p><p>BRSA-Cukurova Group agreement resolves the Pamukbank-Yapi </p><p>Kredi Bank issue.  Noting Tayyip Erdogan\'s December query </p><p>about Turkey joining NAFTA, Ambassador asked for </p><p>clarification on whether the GOT would be able and willing to </p><p>(a) obtain EU approval for an FTA, and (b) include all </p><p>sectors, including agriculture, in such a trade agreement. </p><p>Sener said a possible FTA was "very important," and promised </p><p>to have his experts study the Ambassador\'s questions.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economic Reform </p><p>--------------- </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador called on Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif </p><p>Sener January 28 to deliver ref A points.  He said the USG </p><p>was very concerned that Turkey was now seriously off-track on </p><p>its reform program.  After the elections, the U.S. had </p><p>expressed its willingness to offer assistance to Turkey in </p><p>the event of an Iraq operation, but had made clear that any </p><p>assistance would be conditioned on Turkey\'s full </p><p>implementation of economic reforms and its full cooperation </p><p>on Iraq.  It would not be possible for the U.S. to agree to </p><p>this assistance until Turkey completed its fourth review </p><p>under the IMF program.  The key issues for that review </p><p>include achieving the 6.5 percent primary surplus target and </p><p>resolving the Pamukbank-Yapi Kredi Bank issue.  Looking </p><p>further ahead, it will not be possible for the Administration </p><p>to win Congressional approval for the assistance package </p><p>unless Turkey is on-track on the reform program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ambassador added that we understood the draft LOI </p><p>that Turkish authorities had submitted to the IMF on January </p><p>22 was not sufficient; Fund staff had many difficulties with </p><p>it.  At the same time, markets, which had given the new </p><p>government a vote of confidence after the elections, were now </p><p>questioning the government\'s policy direction.  Everyone -- </p><p>the USG, the IMF, and the markets -- want to see good, </p><p>strong, tough measures to convince the markets the government </p><p>was commited to reform.  Time is limited, so it is important </p><p>for the government to announce measures quickly that </p><p>demonstrate this commitment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Sener agreed that implementing the economic program </p><p>was important.  The government, he said, was not just looking </p><p>one year ahead.  It would face elections again in four years, </p><p>and would have to answer to voters then.  Government leaders </p><p>were aware that, if they created macroeconomic imbalances, </p><p>they would not be able to deliver a sound economy in four </p><p>years.  From this year on, the GOT has to reduce expenditures </p><p>and increase revenues to maintain macro balances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Sener acknowledged that budgetary discussions raised </p><p>serious issues.  For example, they are looking at cutting </p><p>public investments.  This is difficult, particularly because </p><p>some projects in the provinces are already underway.  Despite </p><p>these difficulties, Sener insisted that "we will meet the 6.5 </p><p>percent primary surplus target."  He predicted that the High </p><p>Planning Council meeting, which would begin an hour after his </p><p>meeting with the Ambassador and continue the next day, would </p><p>resolve the budgetary issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) On banking, Sener recounted how the IMF had asked him </p><p>to intervene in the Pamukbank-Yapi Kredi Bank issue, and he </p><p>had declined.  That had turned out to be the right decision, </p><p>as BRSA and the Cukurova Group reached agreement last weekend </p><p>on the banks.  Under the agreement, the Cukurova Group will </p><p>withdraw its lawsuit and pull out of the banking sector, </p><p>while paying off its debts over time.  Sener said he </p><p>considers the issue resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Sener said he knew that Treasury had submitted a </p><p>draft LOI to the IMF, but he had not been informed about IMF </p><p>concerns on that draft.  He acknowledged that market </p><p>sentiment had worsened in the past several weeks, a fact that </p><p>he attributed to concerns about the fragile state of public </p><p>finances and a possible military operation against Iraq.  In </p><p>that sense, it was important that any operation be of short </p><p>duration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Free Trade </p><p>---------- </p><p>8.  (C) Drawing on ref B points, Ambassador reminded Sener </p><p>that Tayyip Erdogan, during his visit to Washington in </p><p>December 2002, had raised the idea of Turkey joining NAFTA. </p><p>The USG, he continued, has said many times that it is open to </p><p>ideas on how to boost bilateral trade, but has also pointed </p><p>out that the U.S. approach to FTAs is rigorous and </p><p>comprehensive.  Before he could suggest that Washington </p><p>consider an FTA, he needed to clarify whether Turkey would be </p><p>prepared to liberalize all sectors, including agriculture, </p><p>and whether it believed it could do so within the context of </p><p>its Customs Union agreement with the EU.  Ambassador </p><p>reiterated that he could not commit the USG to pursue an FTA, </p><p>but thought it would be useful to get Turkey\'s views on these </p><p>two questions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Sener responded that a possible FTA was a "very </p><p>serious issue."  He was aware that Tayyip Erdogan had raised </p><p>the idea in Washington.  "I know Mr. Erdogan very well.  He </p><p>thinks such an agreement should be realized."  Sener said he </p><p>would discuss the matter with the Prime Minister and Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan, and ask experts to start studying the two questions </p><p>the Ambassador had raised.  At a minimum, should the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey decide to pursue an FTA, Turkey would have to ask the </p><p>EU for permission to deviate from the Customs Union\'s common </p><p>external tariff.  This was a very technical matter, so Turkey </p><p>will form a working group to look into it, after which the </p><p>two sides can have a more useful conversation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
