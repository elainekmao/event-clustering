<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 19513 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>DIA FOR OA-5/OS-1D/DB-6D2/JSI-4B/DB-3C1 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: COLOMBIA: 1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 363024; B. 88 BOGOTA 19003 </p><p>     C. BOGOTA 18301 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  COLOMBIA HAS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT WHICH IS UNDER </p><p>ATTACK BY THREE SUBNATIONAL GUERRILLA GROUPS AND BY </p><p>NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  THE COUNTRY IS THE VICTIM OF </p><p>SUSTAINED TERRORIST ATTACKS AND THE FOE OF BOTH </p><p>GUERRILLA AND NARCOTICS-RELATED TERRORISM.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO BARCO EMERGED IN 1989 AS THE </p><p>STANDARDBEARER IN THE INTERNATIONAL FIGHT AGAINST THE </p><p>CRIMINAL POWER OF NARCOTERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE COUNTRY\'S INSTITUTIONS ARE THREATENED THROUGH </p><p>FREQUENT ATTACKS BY INSURGENTS ON RELATIVELY SMALL RURAL </p><p>TOWNS AND POLICE STATIONS.  IN 1989 THE MILITARY\'S </p><p>INCREASED AGGRESSIVENESS SCORED MORE FREQUENT SUCCESSES </p><p>AGAINST SUBVERSIVES.  AS A RESULT, THE RELATIVE BALANCE </p><p>OF FORCES BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE MILITARY HAS </p><p>MOVED IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAVOR, CULMINATING IN A </p><p>NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE THAT RESULTED IN THE HIGHEST NUMBER </p><p>OF GUERRILLA FATALITIES ON RECORD FOR SIMILAR ACTIONS. </p><p>THIS IS MOSTLY DUE TO PRESIDENT BARCO, WHO HAS </p><p>IMPLEMENTED CHANGES THAT HAVE ENHANCED SUBSTANTIALLY THE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ARMED FORCES.  WE EXPECT THESE </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS TO CONTINUE.  IN 1989, THE BARCO </p><p>ADMINISTRATION ENGAGED A FOURTH SUBNATIONAL GUERRILLA </p><p>GROUP IN PEACE TALKS, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PEACE </p><p>INITIATIVE PROMULGATED BY THE GOC IN SEPTEMBER 1988. </p><p>THESE PEACE TALKS APPEARED CLOSE TO FRUITION IN NOVEMBER </p><p>1989, AS THIS GUERRILLA GROUP AGREED TO DEMOBILIZE, </p><p>DISARM AND BECOME A LEGAL POLITICAL PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  INSURGENT VIOLENCE CAN BE CONSIDERED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE GROUP\'S ACTIVITIES HAVE AT </p><p>TIMES CROSSED COLOMBIA\'S BORDER INTO VENEZUELA, TO CARRY </p><p>OUT KIDNAPPING AND EXTORTION SCHEMES, AND TO THE EXTENT </p><p>THAT THE GROUPS RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, INCLUDING </p><p>TRAINING.  CUBA PROVIDES TRAINING TO ALL MAJOR COLOMBIAN </p><p>GUERRILLA GROUP AND AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF COLOMBIANS </p><p>TRAVEL THERE EACH YEAR, WHERE THEY TRAIN WITH </p><p>SUBVERSIVES FROM OTHER NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ANOTHER SOURCE OF TERRORIST VIOLENCE EMANATES FROM </p><p>THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS.  WHILE POLITICS IN NOT THE MAIN </p><p>MOTIVE, VIOLENCE INSTIGATED BY NARCOS DELIVERS A </p><p>POLITICAL IMPACT, CHARACTERIZED BY INTIMIDATION OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS (ESPECIALLY THE JUDICIARY), </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND SUCH OPINION MAKERS AS THE MEDIA. </p><p>NARCOTERRORISM DOES HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER </p><p>SINCE THE TRAFFICKERS USE VIOLENCE TO EXTEND THEIR </p><p>NETWORK AND INFLUENCE BEYOND COLOMBIA, INCLUDING THE </p><p>UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S 1989 CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>NARCOTERRORISM CHANGED DRAMATICALLY THE SITUATION IN </p><p>1988 WHEN THE GOC FAILED TO FIND A WAY TO REIMPOSE </p><p>EXTRADITION.  MOST OFFICIALS CONSIDERED IT TOO DANGEROUS </p><p>(SEE REFTEL C).  CONTINUED NARCO TERRORISM IN 1989, </p><p>GALVANIZED GOVERNMENT RESOLVE AND PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST </p><p>THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  AFTER INCREASED VIOLENCE </p><p>AGAINST JUDGES AND THE KILLING OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE </p><p>AND GOVERNOR OF THE REGION AROUND MEDELLIN, THE BARCO </p><p>ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTED UNPRECEDENTED MEASURES </p><p>AGAINST NARCOS, UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>DECREE POWERS INVOKING COLOMBIA\'S STATE OF SIEGE LAWS. </p><p>ON AUGUST 18 JUST AS THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ADOPTING A </p><p>NEW AND TOUGHER STANCE, THE NARCOS ESCALATED THE </p><p>VIOLENCE FURTHER BY ASSASSINATING THE LEADING CANDIDATE </p><p>FOR PRESIDENT.  THE PRESIDENT\'S MEASURES ENHANCED AND </p><p>STRENGTHENED THOSE ADOPTED BY THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION </p><p>IN NOVEMBER 1988 (REFTEL B), WHICH INCLUDED THE </p><p>IMPOSITION OF MANDATORY LIFE SENTENCES ON THOSE GUILTY </p><p>OF KILLINGS IN THE COURSE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE </p><p>TOUGH ANTI-NARCO DECREES PROMULGATED BY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ON AUGUST 19, 1989 PROVIDED AMONG OTHER THINGS FOR </p><p>EXTRADITION AND ASSETS FORFEITURE OF NARCOTRAFFICKERS. </p><p>THERE FOLLOWED A SERIES OF MASSIVE RAIDS AGAINST LARGE </p><p>NARCO PROPERTIES AND OF EXTRADITION OF A NUMBER OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WANTED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR </p><p>NARCOTRAFFICKING AND/OR MONEY LAUNDERING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  NARCOTERRORISTS RETALIATED WITH BOMBINGS IN </p><p>COLOMBIA\'S MAJOR CITIES AND WITH THE SELECTIVE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF OPINION MAKERS (A CONGRESSMAN, THREE </p><p>MAGISTRATES AND SEVERAL JOURNALISTS) WHO WERE IN FAVOR </p><p>OF EXTRADITION AND OPPOSED TO THE "DIALOGUE" PROPOSED BY </p><p>NARCOS.  IN SEPTEMBER-NOVEMBER, THE SECURITY FORCES HAD </p><p>INCREASING SUCCESS IN DEACTIVATING EXPLOSIVES, CAPTURING </p><p>BOMBERS AND SEIZING A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  BUT THE TERRORIST CAMPAIGN BEGAN TO DISPLAY SIGNS </p><p>THAT THE NARCOS WERE RECEIVING EXPLOSIVE TECHNOLOGY AND </p><p>TRAINING EITHER FROM THE GUERRILLA GROUPS OR FOREIGN </p><p>ADVISORS.  IN MAY, A LARGE CHARGE WAS SET ALONG THE </p><p>ROUTE TO WORK OF THE CHIEF OF THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE POLICE (THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>SECURITY - DAS), GEN. MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ.  IT WAS </p><p>COMMAND DETONATED AS HE DROVE BY BUT HE SURVIVED BECAUSE </p><p>ANOTHER VEHICLE INTERVENED BETWEEN HIS ARMOURED CAR AND </p><p>THE CAR BOMB.  ON DECEMBER 6, 1989, NARCOTERRORISTS </p><p>DETONATED AN ELEVEN HUNDRED POUND EXPLOSION IN FRONT OF </p><p>THE BOGOTA DAS HEADQUARTERS.  THE BOMB KILLED 62, </p><p>INJURED HUNDREDS AND DEMOLISHED THE DAS HEADQUARTERS AND </p><p>OTHER BUILDINGS.  IT WAS THE MOST DEVASTATING EXPLOSION </p><p>IN COLOMBIA\'S HISTORY.  PRECEDING THIS INCIDENT WAS THE </p><p>MID-AIR EXPLOSION OF AN AVIANCA AIRLINER NEAR BOGOTA, </p><p>WHICH IS BELIEVED BY EXPERTS TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN </p><p>ON-BOARD EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.  WHILE THE AUTHORS OF THAT </p><p>HORRIFIC ACT HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED, MANY ASSUME </p><p>THAT THE TRAFFICKERS WERE RESPONSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COLOMBIA HAS WORKED FOR ADOPTION IN THE UN AND THE </p><p>OAS OF RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING THE ILLICIT CONVENTIONAL </p><p>ARMS TRADE, A PROPOSAL REVIVED BY PRESIDENT BARCO IN HIS </p><p>1989 SPEECH BEFORE THE UN.  THESE EFFORTS ARE DESIGNED </p><p>TO LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOPHISTICATED CONVENTIONAL </p><p>ARMS TO WEALTHY TRAFFICKERS AND GUERRILLAS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA HAS MADE NO PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE PLO DOES NOT/NOT HAVE, NOR HAS IT HAD IN THE </p><p>PAST, ANY OFFICIAL STATUS OR RECOGNITION IN COLOMBIA.  A </p><p>PLO REPRESENTATIVE (MANDOUH GABER) WHO HAS REPORTEDLY </p><p>VISITED COLOMBIA IN 1988-89, DOES NOT/NOT ENJOY ANY </p><p>DIPLOMATIC OR QUASI OFFICIAL STATUS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THERE WERE NO COURT PROSECUTIONS IN COLOMBIA IN </p><p>1989 INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCLEAN </p><p></p></div>
