<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004499 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- The Jordanian media over the past few days was </p><p>overtaken by Jordan\'s counter-attack to Al-Jazirah\'s </p><p>program August 6 that harshly slammed the Jordanian </p><p>stand vis--vis the Palestinian issue and Iraq and </p><p>criticized the Hashemite rule for their "pro-Zionist" </p><p>policies.  Newspapers were packed with editorial </p><p>commentaries strongly criticizing Qatar and Al-Jazirah </p><p>for their slanderous attempts against the Jordanian </p><p>stances.  Another lead story is the war on Iraq. </p><p>Majority of commentaries criticize the United States </p><p>as being "obsessed" with launching a war on Iraq. </p><p>They also maintain that this war will only serve the </p><p>U.S. oil interests and the Zionist Lobby interests, </p><p>and has nothing to do with the war on terrorism or the </p><p>inspections. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The war is coming" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/11):  "The war on Iraq is coming for the benefit </p><p>of the American oil lords and the Zionist Lobby, and </p><p>in order to keep the United States in the defensive so </p><p>Americans can forget about the recent financial </p><p>scandals and the stupid and impulsive nature of the </p><p>U.S. administration.  The war is coming unless it </p><p>confronts a strong Arab and international opposition </p><p>and unless Washington comes to the realization that </p><p>striking Iraq is going to be very costly." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The international opposition to the American war" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/11) editorializes:  "The growing Arab, regional </p><p>and European opposition to the American war against </p><p>Iraq is likely to rein in the drive of the hawks of </p><p>the Bush administration towards this war.  It is also </p><p>likely to render any American military action void of </p><p>all moral and legal legitimacy.  It will expose the </p><p>United States as an unjust force with a tendency for </p><p>dangerous aggressiveness, not only against Iraq but </p><p>against the rest of the countries of the world." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Invading Iraq has nothing to do with inspectors" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(08/11):  "The clear fact is that the United States is </p><p>launching a continuous war against terrorism within </p><p>the United States and all over the world.  The human </p><p>targets for this war are Arabs first and Muslims </p><p>second.  The battlefield is the land of the Arabs and </p><p>Muslims.  What is now being prepared for Iraq follows </p><p>that America has already started in Afghanistan and </p><p>what Israeli continues to do in Palestine.  The </p><p>Americans are looking for a foothold that would </p><p>justify a military occupation that would eventually </p><p>become the launching pad for taming the entire Arab </p><p>region.  They have chosen Iraq to be the beginning and </p><p>the example." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Israel and Iraq\'s oil" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Raja Issa writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i (08/12):  "As far </p><p>as the United States is concerned, striking Iraq is </p><p>important.  Iraq is floating on a sea of oil; a weapon </p><p>used America to rule the world.  In addition, and as </p><p>far as Israel is concerned, Iraq is a threat to its </p><p>existence.  Israel rules America and American cannot </p><p>disobey Israel.  Changing the ruling the regime in </p><p>Iraq, which is what the United States wants, means </p><p>changing this country into a subsidiary to the United </p><p>States.  When Iraq is over, it would be Iran\'s turn </p><p>under the pretext that it is being armed by Russia. </p><p>In reality, all eyes would be on its oil, as well as </p><p>the fact that Israel wants to rid itself of any </p><p>dangers to its existence." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Americans are coming" </p><p> </p><p>Chief editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(08/12):  "This American obsession with invading Iraq </p><p>and destroying it is not much different from Sharon\'s </p><p>obsession with destroying the Palestinian people. </p><p>Both the Americans and the Israelis hide behind their </p><p>policies a deep-rooted hatred for the Arabs, that is </p><p>nourished by the September 11 attacks and the </p><p>principles of Zionism that have taken root within the </p><p>decision-making circles in the United States.  The </p><p>obsession of war and hatred that are being brought by </p><p>Israel and the United States might be the hurricane </p><p>that envelops the region.  However, this hurricane is </p><p>going to stop no matter what, but the doors of a long </p><p>and bitter struggle between the Arabs on one hand and </p><p>America and Zionism on the other will have been opened </p><p>for a very long time." </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
