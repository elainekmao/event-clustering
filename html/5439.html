<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000264 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ETRD, PHUM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL PRE-CANDIDATE WHITBECK DISCUSSES </p><p>UPCOMING ELECTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Former senior FRG member Harris Whitbeck </p><p>told the Ambassador that it is almost certain he will run for </p><p>President as the candidate of the Partido Patriota, and said </p><p>the FRG has lost much of its popular support.  He believes </p><p>Rios Montt would be defeated at the polls if he runs.  The </p><p>Ambassador told Whitbeck that the USG will be strictly </p><p>neutral in the election, and said that we hope this </p><p>government and its successor will improve counter-drug </p><p>cooperation.  The Ambassador said CAFTA represents an </p><p>historic opportunity to reduce poverty in Guatemala, and said </p><p>it is urgent that Guatemalans effectively address our </p><p>non-trade concerns that could endanger approval of CAFTA by </p><p>Congress.  It is too early in the electoral season to </p><p>speculate on Whitbeck\'s chances of winning the Presidency, </p><p>but the polls would suggest at this point that he is a long </p><p>shot. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a January 30 breakfast with the Ambassador, former </p><p>senior FRG official Harris Whitbeck said that the Partido </p><p>Patriota had offered to make him its presidential candidate </p><p>in the 2003 elections, and he will make a decision in coming </p><p>days.  He told us it is almost certain he will accept. </p><p>Whitbeck, who was a founding member of the FRG, left the </p><p>ruling party in 2002 and accused it publicly of abandoning </p><p>its principles.  He said that he told Partido Patriota </p><p>founder Otto Perez Molina that his one condition for becoming </p><p>the party\'s presidential standard bearer was that he would </p><p>pick his own cabinet, and Perez Molina could head the party\'s </p><p>congressional team (note: retired General Perez Molina has a </p><p>constitutional impediment that keeps him from being the </p><p>presidential candidate until he has been out of the military </p><p>for five years -- in 2004. That impediment does not apply to </p><p>congressional candidacies.  end note).  Whitbeck believes he </p><p>could secure the support of much of the FRG\'s rural base, </p><p>where he is well known because of his government jobs in </p><p>rural development, and believes voters are looking for an </p><p>alternative to the "corruption-ridden FRG and PAN."  He does </p><p>not believe his "American" image would cost him votes (Note: </p><p>Whitbeck was a dual national, but renounced his U.S. </p><p>citizenship in 1993). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Whitbeck said the FRG is in a tight spot -- Rios Montt </p><p>wants to run, but doesn\'t know if the system will let him; </p><p>the party has no one else it can credibly run, and if it </p><p>stretches outside the party for the candidate, it will </p><p>relinquish control.  Whitbeck opined that the growing public </p><p>momentum for Rios Montt\'s candidacy is designed at least in </p><p>part to keep FRG congressmen from jumping ship and joining </p><p>the opposition, which many are expected to do if Rios Montt </p><p>does not run.  Whitbeck believes that Zury Rios\'s political </p><p>ambitions (which he described as "uncontainable to the point </p><p>of being almost pathological") are also keeping the aging </p><p>General in the political fray.  Whitbeck said that if Rios </p><p>Montt runs, he will lose. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador told Whitbeck that the USG would be </p><p>scrupulously neutral in the upcoming election.  He commented </p><p>that decertification of Guatemala as a cooperating partner in </p><p>the war on drugs was almost certain to happen imminently, and </p><p>said we would be calling on this government and its </p><p>successors to greatly improve counter-narcotics cooperation. </p><p>The lack of significant improvement in counter-narcotics </p><p>performance would imperil Guatemala\'s participation in CAFTA. </p><p> The Ambassador said that CAFTA offers, in our view, the best </p><p>hope the Central American region has had since the Alliance </p><p>for Progress to reduce poverty, and that we hoped Guatemala </p><p>would quickly address the non-trade issues that could become </p><p>impediments to CAFTA ratification.  Whitbeck agreed that </p><p>CAFTA was an historic opportunity for Guatemala, and said all </p><p>parties should be working to ensure that the negotiation is a </p><p>success. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Whitbeck said that reducing the power and influence of </p><p>the narcotics mafias and containing violent crime would be </p><p>difficult challenges for the next government.  He believes </p><p>the military should be reduced, and its excess troops turned </p><p>into a new police force to replace "the current corrupt </p><p>force." He said that, if elected, he would seek USG advice on </p><p>his ministers and senior government officials to ensure that </p><p>he was not putting individuals with ties to organized crime </p><p>in positions of responsibility. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  The long election season is just beginning, </p><p>and it is too soon to tell which two candidates will make it </p><p>to the second round.  Whitbeck will have both the </p><p>disadvantage and the advantage of not being the candidate of </p><p>a major party.  The Partido Patriota, while small, built a </p><p>public name for itself in the 2001 and 2002 protests against </p><p>the Portillo government, and is reported to have received </p><p>significant funding from the Gutierrez-Bosch conglomerate. </p><p>Whitbeck has a better grasp on the realities and needs of </p><p>rural Guatemalans than any of the other potential candidates </p><p>and is progressive on all the issues of importance to us.  At </p><p>this stage, however, the success of his candidacy remains a </p><p>long shot. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
