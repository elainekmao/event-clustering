<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 003423 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, KU, XF </p><p>SUBJECT: GOK SAYS P.A. SUPPORT A BILATERAL ISSUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 2486 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ADCM John G. Moran for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During meetings with the Ambassador on July </p><p>27 and 28, respectively, MFA U/S Khaled Jarallah and Minister </p><p>of Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah discussed </p><p>Kuwaiti financial support for the Palestinian Authority </p><p>(P.A.).  Both made it clear that Kuwait intends to treat </p><p>financial assistance for the P.A. as a bilateral issue, and </p><p>will discuss the matter directly with Abu Mazen during his </p><p>upcoming visit to Kuwait.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>U/S Jarallah on the P.A. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador raised the issue of Kuwaiti financial </p><p>assistance to the Palestinian Authority during his July 27 </p><p>meeting with MFA U/S Khaled Jarallah.  Jarallah said current </p><p>Prime Minister Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah had received a </p><p>letter from Abu Mazen before OIF, asking Kuwait for financial </p><p>assistance in "an amount that was more than the figure now." </p><p>Jarallah said that the GOK has since received a letter asking </p><p>for USD $ 3-4 million, which represented obligations to the </p><p>P.A. that pre-dated the Gulf War.  Shaykh Sabah had agreed to </p><p>make this payment.  He said Palestinian National Council </p><p>member Tawfiq Abu Bakr had recently visited Kuwait and raised </p><p>three issues with Shaykh Sabah.  First, he requested that the </p><p>agreed to assistance be transferred to the P.A.  Secondly, he </p><p>asked about establishing an "embassy" in Kuwait, primarily to </p><p>offer Palestinian expats citizen services, and finally, he </p><p>noted the P.A. was now willing to work with Kuwaitis who had </p><p>property claims in Ramallah (formerly a popular destination </p><p>for Kuwaiti investment).  Although the GOK recognized that </p><p>the opening of a P.A. mission in Kuwait would be politically </p><p>complicated, Jarallah said Shaykh Sabah had agreed to all of </p><p>Abu Bakr\'s proposals.  However, the mission would not receive </p><p>formal embassy status. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Jarallah, who praised recent progress on Road Map </p><p>implementation, asked the Ambassador whether the USG had any </p><p>plans to move forward on other (non-Palestinian) tracks.  He </p><p>said that Syria was of particular concern, and noted that it </p><p>"needs encouragement" before it will begin to take the steps </p><p>necessary to move towards peace.  The Ambassador replied that </p><p>the whole region would do well with peace, and Syria, as a </p><p>key player in the region, could be influential in bringing it </p><p>about. </p><p> </p><p>FM Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah: "Now you\'re Amr Mousa?" </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Following up on A/S Burns\' discussions with FM Dr. </p><p>Mohammed Al-Sabah (reftel), the Ambassador asked the Minister </p><p>during their July 28 meeting if Kuwait had taken any action </p><p>on it\'s P.A. commitments.  Smiling, the FM asked, "So now </p><p>you\'re Amr Mousa, huh?"  Dr. Mohammed went on to explain that </p><p>the GOK understanding of its Arab League commitments were </p><p>different than ours.  He said Kuwait considers that it has </p><p>already fulfilled its Beirut Summit pledge, which was made </p><p>during the height of the Intifada, and which was linked to </p><p>the continuation of "Israeli atrocities" against the </p><p>Palestinians.  Since "the Intifada is basically over," Kuwait </p><p>has decided that it will now deal with any P.A. issues in the </p><p>context of a bilateral relationship, instead of through the </p><p>Arab League. "We consider this a bilateral issue," he said. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Declaring that the GOK has "issues" with the Arab </p><p>League, and with Amr Mousa in particular, Dr. Mohammed </p><p>reminded the Ambassador that Mousa is persona non grata in </p><p>the UAE, and has also had trouble in the not too distant past </p><p>entering Morocco.  Dr. Mohammmed said the GOK would push for </p><p>language from the Arab League condemning the regime of Saddam </p><p>Hussein, and supporting the new Iraqi Governing Council.  He </p><p>added that Kuwait had already drawn up language on the latter </p><p>issue, and would need Palestinian support to get it adopted. </p><p>He implied this would be quid pro quo for additional Kuwaiti </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Dr. Mohammed said Abu Mazen will be received by Kuwait </p><p>during the last half of August, when he plans a tour of the </p><p>Gulf. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment:  The GOK decision to treat the P.A. funding </p><p>matter as a bilateral issue is positive in that it reflects </p><p>official recognition of the strengthening of Abu Mazen\'s </p><p>position and stature.  It also reflects the fragile status of </p><p>GOK/AL relations and Kuwaiti anger with Amr Mousa.  In this </p><p>environment, asking the GOK to honor Arab League commitments </p><p>would not seem the best tack to take to encourage support for </p><p>the P.A.  End Comment. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
