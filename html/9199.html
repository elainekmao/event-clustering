<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PLEASE PASS EST: S.HARDESTY </p><p> </p><p>FOR NP/NE FOR P COMELLA AND DOE/NNSA FOR R.HIBBS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, ENRG, TRGY, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: HFR Petten: Results Of Survey On Preparedness </p><p> </p><p>REF. A) State 170856, B) The Hague 01611, C) Van </p><p> </p><p>Duijn/Hibbs email 6/23 </p><p> </p><p>1. Local media recently reported the outcome of a </p><p>survey on preparedness of the Petten HFR in dealing </p><p>with calamities.  Since the issue is related to the </p><p>physical protection discussions with the Dutch planned </p><p>for July 10-July 11, we bring the news item to the </p><p>attention of the Russell Hibbs team.  An unofficial </p><p>translation of a newspaper article that appeared in the </p><p>local daily newspaper Volkskrant of June 24 follows. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Quote: A recent survey by the Institute for Safety </p><p>and Crisis Management (COT) reveals uncertainty about </p><p>the lines of responsibility in dealing with a calamity </p><p>at the high flux reactor (HFR) at Petten.  The COT </p><p>survey, commissioned by the local municipality of </p><p>Zijpen and the province of Noord-Holland, also shows </p><p>that Zijpen authorities lack the capacity to deal with </p><p>a crisis.  The HFR at Petten is owned by the EU\'s </p><p>Common Research Center (GCO).  This means that Zijpe </p><p>authorities are fully dependent on cooperation by the </p><p>GCO in case of a calamity without the power to enforce </p><p>that cooperation.  According to the COT survey, there </p><p>is little communication between Zijpe authorities and </p><p>the GCO.  The COT concludes that it is the Ministry of </p><p>Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment (VROM) that </p><p>should take the lead in solving this problem.  A VROM </p><p>reaction will follow in the week of June 30, after </p><p>publication of a technical safety report. Unquote. </p><p> </p><p>3. At the time of drafting this cable, post has not </p><p>seen a VROM reaction to the COT report. </p><p> </p><p>4. Please note that in the absence of Todd Kushner, the </p><p>embassy\'s control officer for the visit of the Nuclear </p><p>Physical Protection Team to the HFR in Petten will be </p><p>Jan Razoux Schultz of the Economic Section (office </p><p>phone # 31 70 310 92 76, fax # 31 70 310 93 48, home </p><p>phone 31 71 589 83 05, e-mail: </p><p>razouxje(atsign)state.gov.
