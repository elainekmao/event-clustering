<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ADANA 0023 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TU, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>JANUARY 24, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for January 24, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  U.S. SITE SURVEYERS LEAVE TURKEY </p><p>(Turkiye)  The ten-day-long site surveys by U.S. </p><p>military experts of nine bases and three ports in </p><p>Turkey have ended, with a majority of the 150- </p><p>person U.S. delegation having left Turkey. </p><p>Preliminary results of the site surveys are that </p><p>investments amounting to USD 250-300 million would </p><p>be made at the inspected bases if the government </p><p>were to give permission for their use.  To make </p><p>these investments, a U.S. military force of 4,500- </p><p>5,000 people might need to come to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  ANTI-NUCLEAR ATTACK EXERCISE AT INCIRLIK </p><p>(Turkiye)  Prior to a possible U.S. operation </p><p>against Iraq, exercises are being carried against </p><p>possible nuclear attack at the Incirlik Air Base </p><p>(Adana).  During the two-day-long exercise, 5,000 </p><p>U.S. soldiers and their families carry their gas </p><p>masks around all the time and practice getting into </p><p>shelters in the shortest time possible.  Bolge </p><p>reported that sirens heard from the base caused </p><p>excitement on the part of local people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  "PEACE TRIP AGAINST WAR" </p><p>(Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete/Bolge)  Prompted by the </p><p>"Peace Trip Against War" slogan, a group of people, </p><p>all members of the Human Rights Association (HRA), </p><p>left Istanbul\'s Haydarpasa Train Station by train </p><p>for the Incirlik Air Base (Adana) and the Mersin </p><p>Port to protest a possible operation against Iraq. </p><p>Ankara will be the first stop of the "peace </p><p>volunteers," who are carrying "No To War" and "We </p><p>Do Not Want War" banners.  Dunya reported that the </p><p>Adana War Opponents Platform staged a January 23 </p><p>anti-war demonstration at Adana\'s Ugur Mumcu Square </p><p>during which they shouted anti-war slogans and </p><p>displayed "Close Incirlik Air Base" and "No To War" </p><p>banners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  ANTI-WAR PROTESTS BY DISK CONTINUE </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Confederation of the Revolutionary </p><p>Workers\' Unions (DISK) staged demonstrations in </p><p>Istanbul and Sirnak\'s Habur border gate (with Iraq) </p><p>to protest a possible U.S.-led war in Iraq.  DISK </p><p>members said they wanted peace and brotherhood, not </p><p>U.S. soldiers, to cross over the Iraqi border. </p><p>They called on Members of Parliament to "vote for </p><p>peace." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  SANLIURFA SUPPORT FOR IRAQ SUMMIT IN ISTANBUL </p><p>(Milli Gazete)  A group of Siverek (Sanliurfa) </p><p>residents gathered to express support for the Iraq </p><p>Summit to be held in Istanbul today (1/24) </p><p>following a call by Turkey.  The group voiced </p><p>opposition to a possible U.S.-led war, saying "we </p><p>did not elect the Members of Parliament forming the </p><p>new government to enter into wars with which we </p><p>have nothing to do and from which we will not </p><p>benefit."  The war opponents shouted "No To War" </p><p>slogans by applauding and flying three doves:  a </p><p>black one for U.S. President Bush, a dotted one for </p><p>Saddam Hussein, and a white one for Prime Minister </p><p>(Abdullah) Gul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  MERSIN BUSINESS LEADER:  WAR WILL NOT AFFECT </p><p>MARINE TRADE </p><p>(Turkiye)  While the possibility of a U.S.-led </p><p>operation against Iraq increases day by day, the </p><p>effects of such a war on Turkey and Mersin cause </p><p>concerns, Cihad Lokmanoglu, President of the Mersin </p><p>Chamber of Marine, noted.  The Mersin Port had </p><p>already lost all, over a period of ten years since </p><p>the Gulf War.  For that reason, Lokmanoglu said a </p><p>new war would not substantially affect Mersin\'s </p><p>marine trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  POLICE STILL IN PURSUIT OF SUSPECTED ASSASSINS </p><p>OF OKKAN </p><p>(Cumhuriyet/Evrensel)  Two years have passed since </p><p>the late-January 2001 assassination of former </p><p>Diyarbakir Security Director Gaffar Okkan.  Five </p><p>security officers were also killed during the </p><p>attack.  Three of the suspected assassins </p><p>(Hizbullah members) were killed; nine (13 according </p><p>to Evrensel) others were arrested.  Police are </p><p>searching for five more gunmen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  PRO-OCALAN PROTESTS </p><p>(Evrensel)  Demonstrations were held in Diyarbakir, </p><p>Agri, Van, Hakkari, Siirt, and Mardin provinces to </p><p>protest the eight-week-long isolation imposed on </p><p>KADEK/PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan under the pretext </p><p>of bad weather conditions and refusal of permission </p><p>for him to meet with his attorneys.  In Mardin, </p><p>police assaulted protestors with armored-personnel </p><p>carriers and truncheons, arresting nine of them. </p><p>In Van, seven people were arrested and ordered to </p><p>remain in custody for participation in anti-war and </p><p>anti-isolation demonstrations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  BODY OF KILLED KADEK MEMBER HANDED OVER TO HIS </p><p>FAMILY </p><p>(Evrensel)  The body of KADEK/PKK member Kerim Koc, </p><p>who was killed during a July 2001 clash with </p><p>security forces in a rural area between Bingol and </p><p>Diyarbakir, was handed over to his family following </p><p>the completion of a DNA test. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  DICLE U. SUFFERING FROM SHORTAGE OF ACADEMIC </p><p>POSITIONS </p><p>(Milliyet)  Professor Fikri Canoruc, Rector of </p><p>Diyarbakir\'s Dicle University, criticized the </p><p>Higher Education Council (YOK) for not having given </p><p>his university any academic positions over the past </p><p>two-and-half years.  Upon the President\'s request, </p><p>Canoruc was appointed the Rector although YOK had </p><p>removed his name from the list despite having </p><p>received most of the votes during the elections </p><p>held to name the rector.  Canoruc described the </p><p>situation as "inconsistent with good intentions." </p><p>Canoruc claimed the situation had caused the </p><p>university to lose blood because around 100 </p><p>teaching staff had not been given their academic </p><p>titles although they had gained the right to become </p><p>assistant, associate, and full professors.  He </p><p>added that, with his attitude, YOK President </p><p>Professor Kemal Guruz wanted to disrupt professors\' </p><p>peace and tranquility. </p><p>12.  DEHAP VAN OFFICE RAIDED, TEN ARRESTED IN </p><p>BINGOL </p><p>(Turkiye)  With permission from a local court, Van </p><p>police launched an operation against Democratic </p><p>People\'s Party (DEHAP) Office on January 23. </p><p>During the two-hour-long operation, police searched </p><p>50 people in the DEHAP office and confiscated </p><p>banned books, magazines, handbills and newspapers. </p><p>Following the operation, the DEHAP Provincial </p><p>Chairman, Serafettin Ozalp, as well as two HADEP </p><p>provincial officials, were taken to the Security </p><p>Directorate for interrogation.  In addition, of the </p><p>ten People\'s Democracy Party (HADEP) and DEHAP </p><p>members arrested in Bingol, HADEP Bingol Youth </p><p>Commission President Yilmaz Bulut was ordered to </p><p>remain in custody, while a commission member was </p><p>released.  No information was given about the </p><p>remaining eight arrestees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  MILITARY OFFICER ACCUSED OF INSULTING PUBLIC </p><p>EMPLOYEES </p><p>(Milliyet)  Captain Hakan Kutlu, who is stationed </p><p>at Sanliurfa\'s 20th Armored Brigade, together with </p><p>a group of soldiers, reportedly came to the Social </p><p>Security Institute (SSK) in an official vehicle and </p><p>insulted SSK employees due to an argument between </p><p>his wife and a male colleague of hers over the use </p><p>of a computer.  Kutlu is also accused of insulting </p><p>the SSK Director, Ismail Yilmaztekin.  Yilmaztekin </p><p>said he and Kutlu had only exchanged words and the </p><p>incident was being exaggerated.  An official from </p><p>the Brigade claimed that Kutlu\'s wife had been </p><p>verbally assaulted and threatened.  "Kutlu, without </p><p>having any dialogue with SSK personnel, met with </p><p>the SSK Director.  He (Kutlu) did not do anything </p><p>negative," the official added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  TWENTY-EIGHT TARSUS (MERSIN) MUHKTARS\' </p><p>MISFEASANCE </p><p>(Turkiye/Bolge)  Tarsus (Mersin) District Governor </p><p>Necmi Kurt announced having launched investigations </p><p>against 90 local muhktars (village headmen) and </p><p>filed suit against 28 of them for embezzlement of </p><p>government allocations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  OPEN PRISON VISITS DURING SACRIFICE HOLIDAY </p><p>(Turkiye)  Justice Minister Cemil Cicek sent a </p><p>memorandum to chief prosecutors\' offices for open </p><p>prison visits during the nine-day Sacrifice Holiday </p><p>beginning on February 9.  Inmates and prisoners in </p><p>13 prisons across the country, including those in </p><p>Adana, Gaziantep, and Mersin, will make use of open </p><p>prison visits for a period of up to six days </p><p>between February 9 and 14, thereby permitting </p><p>prisoners and visiting family members to mix </p><p>freely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  OVER 48 KILOS OF HEROIN SEIZED IN MERSIN </p><p>(Turkiye/Milliyet/Cumhuriyet/Bolge)  Acting on a </p><p>tip, Mersin police seized 48.4 kilograms of heroin </p><p>smuggled in through Van\'s Baskale township and </p><p>destined for other countries.  One suspect was </p><p>arrested, while police are searching for two other </p><p>suspects.  In a separate operation in Adana, police </p><p>raided the home of a drug courier and arrested a </p><p>total of six people preparing for a cocaine party. </p><p>Ninety-four grams of cocaine and 20 ecstasy pills </p><p>were confiscated.  Three arrestees were later </p><p>ordered to remain in custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  SUPPORT FOR ZEUGMA </p><p>(Milliyet)  Bilal Necmettin Erdogan, son of AK </p><p>Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, asked for </p><p>assistance from Culture Minister Huseyin Celik when </p><p>Bilal\'s archaeology teacher, a consultant to </p><p>Hewlett Packard Humanities Foundation (HPHF), </p><p>requested him to do so.  Minister Celik said Bilal </p><p>had contacted him to help HPHF overcome </p><p>bureaucratic difficulties regarding its sponsorship </p><p>for archaeological excavations in the ancient city </p><p>of Zeugma (Gaziantep) and establishing a museum. </p><p>"Being a foreign foundation, HPHF faced </p><p>difficulties with respect to the excavations.  They </p><p>(HPHF) will transfer USD 50 million for the </p><p>excavations and we, as the Culture Ministry, want </p><p>these excavations to continue," Celik added.  Celik </p><p>noted that he was planning to bring together </p><p>Gaziantep\'s Sanko Holding Company, which has </p><p>Zeugma\'s name rights, and the Gaziantep Chamber of </p><p>Commerce, an HPHF.  Abdulkadir Konukoglu, owner of </p><p>Sanko, said the name "Zeugma" belongs to history. </p><p>"We will not put any obstacles before them (i.e. </p><p>HPHF) if their goals are to be beneficial to </p><p>Zeugma," Konukoglu argued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  GAZIANTEP CARPET EXPORTS UP OVER 50% IN 2002 </p><p>(Bolge)  According to Yalcin Konukoglu, President </p><p>of the Gaziantep Carpet Producers and Merchants </p><p>Chamber, machine-made carpet exports from the </p><p>province increased 52% in 2002, rising to USD 126.9 </p><p>million from USD 83.5 million in 2001 despite the </p><p>economic crisis.  Major customers included such </p><p>countries as the U.S., the U.K., Greece, and </p><p>Germany. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS IN (SILOPI) SIRNAK </p><p>(Radikal/Bolge)  The Sirnak Governor\'s and the </p><p>Silopi (Sirnak) district Governor\'s Offices spent </p><p>TL 6 trillion (approx. USD 3.6 million) for </p><p>educational projects in Silopi over the past three </p><p>years.  In the same period, the number of </p><p>classrooms across the district increased nearly </p><p>100%, rising from 170 to 330.  As a result of these </p><p>projects, the number of students fell from 100 to </p><p>40 per classroom.  The projects were financed </p><p>mostly through donations and revenues from the </p><p>district\'s Habur border gate.  In addition, the </p><p>National Education Ministry donated computer </p><p>laboratories in some schools; a local school came </p><p>first at a nationwide website design competition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  VILLAGE RETURN PROJECT INCREASES HONEY </p><p>PRODUCTION Dunya reported that the Village Return </p><p>Project had led to an increase in honey production </p><p>in Bitlis, which reportedly has potential to </p><p>produce nearly 800 tons of honey. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
