<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003265 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY:  SOME POSITIVE SIGNS, BUT LITTLE </p><p>LONG-TERM CONFIDENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ISTANBUL 0671 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The rapid end of the Iraq war, prospect </p><p>of U.S. and IMF money, and a global emerging market rally </p><p>have combined to boost the Turkish currency and reduce </p><p>interest rates substantially in recent weeks.  Meanwhile, </p><p>exports and industrial production continue to rise, while </p><p>inflationary expectations have fallen, increasing the </p><p>prospects for Turkey meeting its 2003 growth and inflation </p><p>targets.  On the other hand, conversations with foreign </p><p>investment bankers and local business executives reveal </p><p>little confidence in the GOT\'s ability to build on these </p><p>positive trends and to manage the economy effectively in the </p><p>year ahead.  The bottom line:  although the mood is more </p><p>buoyant than two months ago, investors realize the </p><p>fundamentals have not changed and thus remain reluctant to </p><p>look beyond the next several months.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Although they have weakened slightly in the past </p><p>few days, Turkish markets have staged a huge rally in the </p><p>past seven weeks.  From their March 25 lows, the lira has </p><p>strengthened from TL 1.750 million/dollar to TL 1.485 </p><p>million/dollar, and yields on the benchmark t-bill have </p><p>fallen from 73.5 percent to just over 50 percent.  Investment </p><p>bankers (we have spoken this week to Goldman Sachs, </p><p>Deutschbank, Merrill Lynch, HCIstanbul, ING Barings, and </p><p>several of their clients) attribute this rally to a </p><p>combination of positive developments:  the rapid, successful </p><p>conclusion of the Iraq war (with relatively limited impact on </p><p>Turkey\'s economy), the prospect of significant U.S. financial </p><p>assistance, completion of the Fourth Review under the IMF </p><p>program, and the post-war global rally in emerging markets, </p><p>as investor risk appetite has returned.  Central Bank Markets </p><p>Department General Manager Akil Ozcay told us May 14 that two </p><p>internal factors also played a role:  the shift by Turkish </p><p>depositors of about 7 percent ($3 billion) of their foreign </p><p>exchange deposits to lira deposits at the time the lira </p><p>reached its low (i.e., a significant bet on the lira); and, </p><p>related to that, some shift from dollars to lira as people </p><p>made payments under Turkey\'s "tax peace" program.  (Note;  Of </p><p>course, some of the lira\'s rally against the dollar reflects </p><p>the dollar\'s global weakness.  End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  The real economy also has shown signs of </p><p>improvement (reftel), although not as dramatic as in </p><p>financial markets.  Industrial production rose 5.6 percent in </p><p>March (year-on-year), above expectations, and 7.5 percent for </p><p>the quarter.  Exports increased 27.5 percent in March (and 27 </p><p>percent for the first quarter), and the Exporters Association </p><p>estimates strong growth for April as well.   March\'s sharp </p><p>(44.8 percent) rise in imports suggests growing domestic </p><p>demand, though it is also raising concerns about the size of </p><p>Turkey\'s current account deficit this year.  In the past </p><p>week, State Minister for Trade Kursad Tuzmen has joined a </p><p>growing chorus of exporters warning that the lira\'s </p><p>appreciation is hurting their competitiveness.  Oyak </p><p>Executive VP Ergun Okur told us May 14 that the company was </p><p>now losing money on some auto exports because of the lira\'s </p><p>strength. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The Central Bank\'s latest inflationary expectations </p><p>survey also came in positive, as expectations for year-end </p><p>CPI fell from 28 to 26.6 percent.  Central Bank officials, </p><p>along with Treasury U/S Ibrahim Canakci, remain hopeful that </p><p>they can still hit the 20 percent CPI target for the year, </p><p>though they acknowledge they will miss the 17 percent WPI </p><p>target.  The seasonal decline in agricultural prices, </p><p>combined with the strength of the lira, lower oil prices, and </p><p>declining expectations, should all help keep inflation in </p><p>check in the months ahead. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) That is the good news.  The bad news is that, based </p><p>on our conversations with local business executives and </p><p>several groups of foreign investment banks in the past week, </p><p>there is little optimism that the government will be able to </p><p>build on recent positive developments.  As Deutschbank </p><p>economist Marco Annunziato put it, "the recent confluence of </p><p>events gives Turkey a great opportunity to begin a virtuous </p><p>economic cycle, but we have been struck in our conversations </p><p>by the complete lack of confidence (in Istanbul) in this </p><p>government\'s ability to take advantage of the opportunity." </p><p>Turkish Young Businessmen\'s Association Ankara Chairman Murat </p><p>Sarayli said Turkish companies are still reluctant to invest </p><p>(other than those involved in exports) because they cannot </p><p>plan beyond the next 3-6 months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Investment banker contacts note that the government </p><p>continues to move slowly and half-heartedly to meet IMF </p><p>conditions, while intermittently offering populist measures </p><p>that undermine whatever credibility it has built up via the </p><p>reform measures it has taken.  As a result, they say, </p><p>financial markets are likely to remain vulnerable to even </p><p>minor shocks, with little prospect of a long-term, steady </p><p>decline in interest rates of the sort that would reduce </p><p>concerns about debt sustainability.  They predict that, in </p><p>the next few months, investors will begin to focus on </p><p>Turkey\'s very large external debt repayment schedule for </p><p>2004, and will want to see strong evidence that the </p><p>government is faultlessly implementing its reform program. </p><p>The bottom line, therefore, is that, while the government has </p><p>been able to lengthen t-bill maturities to some extent, there </p><p>remains little appetite -- among both financial and </p><p>non-financial investors -- for medium and long-term investing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment:  Three times in the past year, nominal </p><p>interest rates on t-bills have fallen to the 50 percent </p><p>level, only to rise again due to policy failings or political </p><p>developments (eg. the declining health of then-PM Ecevit last </p><p>year).  Based on our latest conversations, our sense is that </p><p>investors almost expect a repeat of this pattern.  One </p><p>foreign investment banker told us his company was making a </p><p>list of the "trigger points" that would cause markets to fall </p><p>again.  Changing this mentality will require improved </p><p>economic policy performance (eg. surprising the markets by </p><p>quickly completing the Fifth Review) at a time when many fear </p><p>all the good news will encourage GOT complacency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
