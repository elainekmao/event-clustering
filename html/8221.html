<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000934 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JFRASER </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: READOUT ON ELECTION TRIBUNALS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Begin Summary: The Nigerian constitution and the </p><p>Electoral Act of 2002 allow candidates or parties to petition </p><p>State Election Tribunals to correct alleged electoral </p><p>irregularities.  Defeated Gubernatorial and Assembly </p><p>candidates in 24 states have filed cases before their </p><p>states, tribunals.  The courts have already shown a wide </p><p>variance in methods and requirements.  Although the Electoral </p><p>Act gives parties 30 days to file petitions, the Act did not </p><p>give the tribunals specific time limits in which to decide </p><p>cases.  Thus, most INEC-declared winners will likely be </p><p>inaugurated before the tribunals pass their judgments. End </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>WHAT ARE THE TRIBUNALS? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Election tribunals have been constituted in each of </p><p>the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory to hear </p><p>petitions arising from the conduct of all elections within </p><p>the respective states.  If unsatisfied with the tribunal,s </p><p>judgment, a person can petition the Federal Court of Appeal </p><p>and finally the Supreme Court (Note: At the speed which the </p><p>Nigerian legal system normally moves, this appeal process </p><p>could take several months).  All complaints must be filed </p><p>with the tribunal within 30 days of the election.  However, </p><p>neither the Constitution nor the Electoral Act specify a time </p><p>limit for resolution.  Complaints related to the Presidential </p><p>election are to be filed directly with the Court of Appeal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>RULES OF EVIDENCE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Tribunals use various rules of evidence, depending on </p><p>whether the alleged offence is civil or criminal.  The </p><p>Electoral Act lists possible offences.  The Act allows for </p><p>flexible procedures to make it less cumbersome.  The standard </p><p>for modifying election results is based on a number of </p><p>factors, including proof of irregularities that substantially </p><p>affected the final results and evidence that a candidate was </p><p>unqualified to run for office.  The tribunals can annul </p><p>results, award the election to a different candidate or call </p><p>for new elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Already, the tribunals have exhibited a wide disparity </p><p>in their actions and decisions.  In one state, a tribunal has </p><p>declared that it will recess until after the inauguration. </p><p>Another state,s tribunal has stated it will not recess for </p><p>any reason until all decisions are rendered.  Some state </p><p>tribunals have already demanded all INEC documents for all </p><p>elections for both sides to use as evidence, while at least </p><p>one other tribunal has refused to allow political parties to </p><p>view INEC documents provided. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CURRENT PETITIONS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In spite of initial reticence to use the elections </p><p>tribunals, petitions for at least 88 cases in 24 states have </p><p>been filed.  These include 10 cases for Governor, 14 for </p><p>Senate, 63 for House, and 1 for State Assembly.  The ANPP has </p><p>also filed its petition contesting the Presidential Election. </p><p> Filing for the National Assembly closed on May 12, while </p><p>filing for Gubernatorial and Presidential elections closed </p><p>May 19.  The deadline for State Assemblies elections is June </p><p>2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Observers worry that Executive funding of the </p><p>judiciary and tribunal appointments guided by the state </p><p>judiciary could impact the impartiality of the tribunals. </p><p>The federal constitution empowers a state governor to appoint </p><p>the state Chief Judge through the National Judicial Council. </p><p>The Chief Judge, in turn, recommends jurists as members of </p><p>tribunals.  However, no one is to serve on a tribunal in </p><p>his/her state of origin.  Justice Uwais, Chief Justice of the </p><p>Supreme Court, said at the swearing in of the members of the </p><p>tribunals that: "In Nigeria, corruption and ethnicity have </p><p>had, in the not distant past, placed the role of Election </p><p>Tribunals in jeopardy...when they fail in their duties, the </p><p>consequences have been violence resulting in murder, arson </p><p>and grievous bodily hurt." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Although in recent times the Supreme Court has </p><p>delivered important judgments that demonstrate its ability to </p><p>assert independence from the Executive, lower levels of the </p><p>judiciary have not exhibited the same level of independence </p><p>and are still seen by most observers as subordinate to the </p><p>Executive Branch and the Governors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: Most Nigerians believe that many elections </p><p>were marked by fraud and that the tribunals will not do </p><p>anything to right these wrongs unless directed by the </p><p>Presidency.  The tribunals have the chance to demonstrate the </p><p>independence of the judiciary, correct electoral flaws, and </p><p>cool the political temperature if their decisions change some </p><p>results, particularly in the South-East and South-South.  If </p><p>the tribunals fail to grasp this opportunity to lessen </p><p>political tensions and make the results more reflective of </p><p>the popular will on election day, the credibility of both the </p><p>judiciary and of Nigeria,s foundling democracy will suffer. </p><p>END COMMENT </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
