<p>UNCLAS BRASILIA 001413 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IFD/OIA, WHA/BSC, AND WHA/EPSC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, ECON, BR </p><p>SUBJECT:  PL 108-7:  Survey on Brazilian Fiscal </p><p>Transparency and Accountability </p><p> </p><p>Ref.  State 100283 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Reftel requests post\'s response to a survey on fiscal </p><p>transparency and accountability in order to provide a </p><p>report required by PL 108-7.  Below is response for Brazil, </p><p>keyed to questionnaire in paragraph 7 of reftel. </p><p> </p><p>a.  3.  The government publishes a budget with minimum </p><p>delay. </p><p> </p><p>b.  Yes, the combined fiscal position of subnational </p><p>governments is published.  The Central Bank publishes </p><p>monthly data on the combined surpluses/deficits of sub- </p><p>federal governments with a three-week lag based on changes </p><p>in public sector debt balances.  More detailed information, </p><p>based on cash flow reports by states and municipalities, is </p><p>harder to obtain and has a much longer lag. </p><p> </p><p>c.  The budget is published in the official gazette and is </p><p>available on the internet.  The government provides </p><p>detailed summaries of the budget and budget amendments to </p><p>the media. </p><p> </p><p>d.  3.  The federal government has an excellent system of </p><p>budget reporting, and is assisting subnational governments </p><p>improve their budget reporting systems.  Actual budget </p><p>expenditures typically are less than budgeted by congress. </p><p> </p><p>e.  Basic budget procedures are established in the 1988 </p><p>Constitution.  The 2000 Fiscal Responsibility Law </p><p>establishes stringent budget guidelines and reporting </p><p>requirements.  The 2000 Fiscal Crime Law establishes </p><p>criminal penalties for public officials that fail to comply </p><p>with specific budget requirements. </p><p> </p><p>f.  3.  There are detailed laws/regulations establishing </p><p>fiscal transparency. </p><p> </p><p>g.  3.  The Fiscal Responsibility Law and Fiscal Crime Law </p><p>entered into force in 2000.  Public officials are </p><p>notionally subject to criminal penalties if they fail to </p><p>comply with the law.  The vast majority of public officials </p><p>appear to take the Fiscal Responsibility Law seriously, </p><p>although the criminal penalties of the Fiscal Crime Law </p><p>have yet to be invoked. </p><p> </p><p>h.  3.  Distribution of tax powers and expenditure </p><p>responsibilities is clear and supported by open and stable </p><p>intergovernmental transfer mechanisms. </p><p> </p><p>i.  Yes, there are independent auditing bodies at the </p><p>federal and state level, although the commissioners are </p><p>appointed by the executive. </p><p> </p><p>j.  3.  Publicly owned entities are under clear control of </p><p>the central government budget process.  A possible weak </p><p>point is lending by government-owned banks, but the banks </p><p>are subject to same regulatory requirements as private </p><p>banks, and subsidized lending is supposed to be covered by </p><p>transfers from the government. </p><p> </p><p>k.  3.  Privatization processes are fully transparent and </p><p>comprehensively reported. </p><p> </p><p>l.  3.  Budget revenue and expenditure estimates are very </p><p>reliable, although a recent increase in inflation has added </p><p>a small degree of uncertainty to revenue forecasts. </p><p> </p><p>m.  Since 1998 the Government of Brazil has been committed </p><p>to fiscal discipline and transparency, first under the </p><p>Cardoso administration and now under the Lula </p><p>administration.  The Fiscal Responsibility Law, passed in </p><p>2000, also imposes stringent requirements on state and </p><p>municipal governments, most of whom take these </p><p>responsibilities seriously.  Fiscal responsibility at the </p><p>subnational level is reinforced by debt rescheduling </p><p>agreements that most states and many municipalities have </p><p>with the federal government.  These agreements establish </p><p>certain budget requirements and give the federal government </p><p>the right to withhold transfers to states and </p><p>municipalities that are in arrears on debt payments. </p><p> </p><p>n.  The U.S. government does not have any programs in </p><p>Brazil that promote accurate disclosure of revenues and </p><p>expenditures.  The IMF and World Bank have worked with the </p><p>federal and subfederal governments on improving fiscal </p><p>management. </p><p> </p><p>Hrinak </p><p></p></div>
