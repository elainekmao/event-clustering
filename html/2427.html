(C) SUMMARY: ON JANUARY 11, THE PARLIAMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE PASSED THE DRACONIAN PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY </p><p>ACT (POSA), WHICH WAS GAZETTED AND WENT INTO EFFECT ON </p><p>JANUARY 22.  THE POSA REPLACES THE EQUALLY DRACONIAN LAW </p><p>AND ORDER MAINTENANCE ACT (LOMA), LEGISLATION THAT WAS </p><p>ORIGINALLY ENACTED BY THE COLONIAL REGIME IN THE EARLY </p><p>1960S.  THE POSA\'S MOST EGREGIOUS PROVISIONS MAKE </p><p>"INSULTING THE PRESIDENT" A CRIMINAL OFFENSE, GRANT THE </p><p>POLICE WIDE POWERS TO REGULATE AND BAN PUBLIC </p><p>GATHERINGS, AUTHORIZE THE POLICE TO USE LETHAL FORCE TO </p><p>BREAK UP PUBLIC GATHERINGS, REQUIRE ALL PERSONS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO CARRY IDENTITY DOCUMENTS, AND GRANT THE </p><p>POLICE POWERS TO SEARCH PERSONS AND SEIZE PROPERTY </p><p>WITHOUT WARRANTS.  ENACTED TO SUPPRESS ANY DISSENT </p><p>ARISING FROM THE MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE POSA </p><p>IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO AFFECT CIVIL LIBERTIES IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JANUARY 11, AFTER </p><p>15 HOURS OF CONTINUOUS DEBATE, THE ZIMBABWE PARLIAMENT </p><p>PASSED THE PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY ACT (POSA), ALONG </p><p>WITH THE GENERAL LAWS AMENDMENTS ACT, WHICH AMENDS THE </p><p>ELECTORAL ACT (TO BE REPORTED SEPTEL).  THE POSA WENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00268  01 OF 04  291524Z </p><p>INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 22 AFTER IT WAS SIGNED BY </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND GAZETTED THE SAME DAY.  THE POSA </p><p>REPLACES THE COLONIAL-ERA LAW AND ORDER AND MAINTENANCE </p><p>ACT (LOMA), WHICH THE RHODESIAN REGIME HAD PASSED TO </p><p>SUPPRESS BLACK NATIONALISM.  SOME CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS </p><p>BLASTED THE POSA AS MORE DRACONIAN THAN THE LOMA OR </p><p>SECURITY LEGISLATION UNDER THE APARTHEID REGIME IN SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA.  LEGAL RIGHTS GROUPS SAY THE POSA LEAVES SO MUCH </p><p>ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION IN MANY AREAS THAT IT GIVES </p><p>POLICE AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CARTE BLANCHE IN </p><p>ARRESTING AND PROSECUTING ALMOST ANYONE OPPOSED TO GOZ </p><p>POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE POSA IS DIVIDED INTO SIX PARTS, WHICH IN </p><p>TURN ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO A TOTAL OF 46 SECTIONS. </p><p>DESCRIBED BELOW ARE THE MOST WORRISOME SECTIONS, THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL OFFENSES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PUNISHMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>PART II: OFFENSES AGAINST GOVERNMENT AND SECURITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>SECTION 6: ACTS OF INSURGENCY, BANDITRY, SABOTAGE OR </p><p>TERRORISM DEFINED AS KILLING OR INJURING ANOTHER PERSON, </p><p>DAMAGING PROPERTY, INFLICTING FINANCIAL LOSS, </p><p>OBSTRUCTING FREE MOVEMENT, OR DISRUPTING AN ESSENTIAL </p><p>SERVICE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CAUSING AN INSURRECTION OR </p><p>FORCIBLE RESISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OR DEFENSE FORCES. </p><p>ACTS UNDER THIS SECTION THAT CAUSE THE DEATH OF A PERSON </p><p>ARE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH OR LIFE IMPRISONMENT; ALL OTHER </p><p>CASES ARE PUNISHABLE BY LIFE IMPRISONMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00268  01 OF 04  291524Z </p><p> </p><p>SECTION 7: RECRUITING, TRAINING OR ENCOURAGING THE </p><p>TRAINING OF PERSONS FOR ACTS OF INSURGENCY, BANDITRY, </p><p>SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM; PUNISHABLE BY LIFE IMPRISONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SECTIONS 9-10: SUPPLYING WEAPONRY TO INSURGENTS, </p><p>BANDITS, SABOTEURS OR TERRORISTS; PUNISHABLE BY LIFE </p><p>IMPRISONMENT.
