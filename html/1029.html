THE FOLLOWING RESTATES AND RESPONDS TO EACH OF THE QUESTIONS </p><p>SET FORTH IN REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>A.   DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF EACH COUNTRY </p><p>TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 1999, INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE </p><p>GIVEN TO HOST COUNTRY ACTIONS REGARDING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST </p><p>OR AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: THE SAG CONTINUES ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE KHOBAR TOWERS </p><p>BOMB ATTACK OF JUNE 1996 WHICH KILLED 19 U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL. </p><p>THE SAG HAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT IT IS STILL LOOKING FOR THREE </p><p>SAUDI SUSPECTS LINKED TO THE BOMBING.  THE THREE ARE WANTED FOR </p><p>QUESTIONING AND ARE BELIEVED TO BE OUTSIDE OF THE KINGDOM.  THE SAG </p><p>IS STILL HOLDING A NUMBER OF SAUDI CITIZENS IN DETENTION IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING.  NO PROSECUTION OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC </p><p>LEGAL ACTION BEGAN IN 1999 REGARDING ANY SUSPECTS INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>BOMBING.  THERE WERE NO OTHER KNOWN TERRORIST CASES OR ACTIONS THAT </p><p>CAME BEFORE THE JUDICIARY IN 1999. </p><p> </p><p>B.   DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION </p><p>OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR? </p><p>PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO </p><p>U.S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: THE SAG REQUESTED THAT CANADA DEPORT SAUDI CITIZEN HANI </p><p>AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA IN 1997.  CANADIAN OFFICIALS DETAINED AL- </p><p>SAYEGH IN MARCH 1997 ON CHARGES OF DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUNE </p><p>1996 KHOBAR TOWERS BOMB ATTACK.  CANADA DEPORTED AL-SAYEGH TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AFTER DOCUMENTS LINKING HIM TO SAUDI HIZBOLLAH WERE </p><p>PRESENTED TO THE COURT.  THE SAG THEN REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF </p><p>AL-SAYEGH FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.  FOLLOWING A LENGTHY </p><p>PERIOD OF REVIEW, HEARINGS BEFORE AN IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION </p><p>(INS) JUDGE, AND SEVERAL APPEALS TO FEDERAL COURTS IN 1999, THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FINALIZED THE EXTRADITION CASE IN LATE </p><p>SEPTEMBER AND THE U.S. DEPORTED AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA ON </p><p>OCTOBER 11, 1999.  THERE HAVE BEEN MEDIA REPORTS THAT THE SAG HAS </p><p>REQUESTED THAT THE TALEBAN GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN EXTRADITE </p><p>SAUDI-BORN TERRORIST FINANCIER AND ORGANIZER USAMA BIN LADEN.  BIN </p><p>LADEN, WHO WAS STRIPPED OF HIS SAUDI CITIZENSHIP IN 1994, WAS </p><p>INDICTED ON NOVEMBER 5, 1998 BY A U.S. FEDERAL GRAND JURY IN NEW </p><p>YORK, WHICH ALLEGED THAT HE AND OTHERS ENGAGED IN AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONSPIRACY TO ATTACK U.S. FACILITIES AND TO KILL U.S. CITIZENS </p><p>INCLUDING IN NAIROBI, KENYA AND DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA ON AUGUST </p><p>7, 1998.  SAG OFFICIALS HAVE DENIED THE REPORTS OF THE EXTRADITION </p><p>REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>C.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO THE SAG\'S </p><p>PROSECUTION OF PERSONS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>WITHIN SAUDI ARABIA.  HOWEVER, THE SAG HAS FEW EXTRADITION TREATIES </p><p>OUTSIDE OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE ARAB LEAGUE AND THE LEAGUE\'S </p><p>ANTI-TERRORIST AGREEMENT, WHICH CONTAINS EXTRADITION ARTICLES. </p><p> </p><p>D.   DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. </p><p>THESE WOULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: THE SAG AT ALL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE KING, CROWN PRINCE, </p><p>MINISTER OF DEFENSE, MINISTER OF INTERIOR, MINISTER OF INFORMATION, </p><p>ISLAMIC ULAMA, AND OFFICIAL NEWS MEDIA PUBLICLY AND CONSISTENTLY </p><p>CONDEMNS TERRORISM IN UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS, INCLUDING BY REFUTING </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL/RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TERRORISM.  IN A NOVEMBER </p><p>1999 INTERVIEW THE CROWN PRINCE AGAIN STATED THAT TERRORIST ACTIONS </p><p>ARE UN-ISLAMIC AND CALLED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CONCERTED EFFORT TO </p><p>WIPE OUT THE PHENOMENON OF TERRORISM.  THE SAG CONTINUES TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING AND HAS CONTINUED TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH THE USG IN ITS OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>E.   DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1999 BY </p><p>THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FORA. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: INTERNALLY, THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR </p><p>TOWERS BOMBING.  IT HAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN NUMEROUS MEASURES TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN PROTECTION OF U.S. MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AFTER THE AUGUST 1998 BOMBINGS OF U.S. EMBASSIES IN </p><p>EAST AFRICA, A THREAT AGAINST U.S. FACILITIES IN OCTOBER 1998, AND </p><p>AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF DESERT FOX IN DECEMBER 1998. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, IN JANUARY 1998, THE SAG JOINED THE ARAB LEAGUE </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTERS IN THE UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF AN ANTI-TERRORIST </p><p>COOPERATION ACCORD.  THE AGREEMENT WAS RATIFIED BY THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTERS IN RIYADH IN SEPTEMBER 1998.  AT A NOVEMBER 1999 </p><p>MEETING OF THE GULF COOPERATION STATES (GCC), THE INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTERS OF MEMBER STATES, INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA, DECIDED TO FORM </p><p>A COMMITTEE TO WORK OUT A STRATEGY TO FIGHT TERRORISM.  THE </p><p>COMMITTEE IS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE COOPERATION AND SECURITY </p><p>COORDINATION AMONGST MEMBER STATES AND SHOULD ENABLE MORE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THREAT INFORMATION.  PRINCE SULTAN, </p><p>MINISTER OF DEFENSE, STATED DURING HIS NOVEMBER 1999 VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON THAT SAUDI ARABIA WAS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE </p><p>UNITED STATES TO DEFEAT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>F.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS, INCLUDING </p><p>(BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS </p><p>AND THEIR ACTIVITIES; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RECOGNITION; MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC </p><p>PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; PROVISION OF SANCTUARY AND/OR THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF TERRORIST GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING OR </p><p>TRAINING SITES; PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON </p><p>TERRORISM IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: THE SAG DOES NOT POLITICALLY OR FINANCIALLY SUPPORT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR ACTIVITIES.  ITS </p><p>REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE </p><p>VOLUNTARY AGENCIES OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES.  HOWEVER, IT IS </p><p>NOT CLEAR THAT THESE REGULATIONS ARE CONSISTENTLY ENFORCED.  THERE </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION REPRESENTATIVES SOLICIT AND COLLECT PRIVATE FUNDS IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA.  THE SAG LEADERSHIP CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS TERRORISM </p><p>AND TERRORIST ACTS AS BEING CONTRARY TO ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>G.   HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE SEVEN </p><p>GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY AS STATE SPONSORS OF </p><p>TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, AND </p><p>SUDAN.) </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: THE SAG MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUPPORTING ANY OF THE </p><p>SEVEN COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S TERRORISM LIST REGARDING A TERRORIST </p><p>ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>H.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1998, POSITIVE OR </p><p>NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: THE SAG HAS CONTINUED TO HAVE A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF </p><p>THE TERRORIST THREAT AFTER THE AUGUST 1998 BOMBINGS OF U.S. </p><p>EMBASSIES IN KENYA AND TANZANIA.  IN RESPONSE TO THE EAST AFRICA </p><p>ATTACKS, AS WELL AS THE ATTACKS ON SAUDI SOIL IN 1995 AND 1996 </p><p>AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS AND PERSONNEL, SAG OFFICIALS WORLDWIDE HAVE </p><p>STATED THEIR DETERMINATION TO FIGHT TERRORISM.  THE SAG, AT THE </p><p>DIRECT INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CROWN PRINCE, HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH </p><p>THE U.S. TO ENHANCE THE SECURITY OF AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA.  THE </p><p>SAG, IN CONCERT WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GCC, HAS FORMED AN ANTI- </p><p>TERRORISM COMMITTEE, CALLED THE SECURITY STRATEGY COMMITTEE, AIMED </p><p>AT COORDINATING INFORMATION AND COOPERATION AMONG MEMBER STATES. </p><p>THE SAG IS FULLY COMPLYING WITH THE SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE U.N. </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL AGAINST THE TALEBAN REGIME IN AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>INCLUDING THE TERMINATION OF ARIANA AIRLINE FLIGHTS TO JEDDAH.  THE </p><p>SAUDIS HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED ON THE TALEBAN TO EXPEL USAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN FROM AFGHAN TERRITORY SO THAT HE MAY BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE IN </p><p>ANOTHER COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>I.   DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH </p><p>THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REQUESTS TO THE </p><p>HOST GOVERNMENT FOR SPECIFIC COOPERATION AND EFFORTS BY THE UNITED </p><p>STATES IN THE HOST COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL </p><p>SUPPORT TO TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR </p><p>ACTIVITIES. DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF THE HOST COUNTRY\'S COOPERATION </p><p>WITH THOSE EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH </p><p>THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS SATISFIED THE SPECIFIC REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: BEGINNING WITH THE 1996 VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA OF A USG </p><p>INTERAGENCY COUNTERTERRORISM TEAM FOLLOWING THE 1995 OPM/SANG </p><p>BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG ENTERED INTO UNPRECEDENTED, </p><p>COORDINATED, INTERAGENCY CONSULTATIONS ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES WHICH ENGENDERED HIGH-LEVEL SAG INTEREST AND THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE SAG MINISTRIES.  THIS INTEREST AND </p><p>PARTICIPATION HAS CONTINUED AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THROUGHOUT </p><p>1999.  THE USG AND SAG CONTINUE TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY ISSUES AFFECTING AMERICAN AND SAUDI </p><p>INTERESTS IN THE REGION.  CONSULTATIONS AND TRAINING FOR SAUDI </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES ALSO </p><p>OCCURRED.  U.S. AND SAUDI OFFICIALS HAVE MET IN THE CONTEXT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE TRANS-NATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT </p><p>TO TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY.  COOPERATION BETWEEN </p><p>THE USG AND SAG INCREASED FURTHER AFTER THE 1998 EAST AFRICA </p><p>BOMBINGS.  THE FBI COORDINATES ITS INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS WITH THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR AND MAINTAINS A PERMANENTLY STAFFED LEGAL </p><p>ATTACHE OFFICE IN THE U.S. EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>J.   IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL INFORMATION, IF THE UNITED STATES </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM THE HOST GOVERNMENT DURING </p><p>THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN </p><p>ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES CITIZENS </p><p>OR INTERESTS, PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: </p><p> </p><p>     (I) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES IN APPREHENDING, CONVICTING, AND </p><p>PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACT; </p><p>AND </p><p>     (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING IN PREVENTING FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST THE </p><p>UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: (I)  THE SAG HAS SOUGHT TO APPREHEND, CONVICT, AND PUNISH </p><p>THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH THE OPM/SANG AND KHOBAR TOWERS </p><p>BOMBINGS AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS.  IN THIS REGARD, ON APRIL </p><p>22, 1996 FOUR SAUDI NATIONALS PUBLICLY CONFESSED TO COMMITTING  THE </p><p>OPM/SANG BOMBING OF NOVEMBER 1995.  THEY WERE EXECUTED ON MAY 31, </p><p>1996.  THE SAG HAS COOPERATED WITH THE USG, ALTHOUGH EARLY </p><p>COOPERATION WAS NOT AT THE LEVEL EXPECTED BY USG OFFICIALS.  SAUDI </p><p>OFFICIALS AND THE FBI CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY ON MANY </p><p>INVESTIGATION ISSUES RELATED TO BOTH BOMBINGS AND CONSULT CLOSELY </p><p>WITH EACH OTHER ON THE STATUS OF THE KHOBAR BOMBING INVESTIGATION. </p><p>SAUDI OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE USG, ESPECIALLY </p><p>THE FBI, IN COORDINATING THE OCTOBER EXTRADITION OF HANI AL-SAYEGH </p><p>IN ORDER TO ASSIST IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KHOBAR TOWERS </p><p>BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>          (II)  THE SAG CONTINUES TO DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE HUMAN AND </p><p>FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECT USG PERSONNEL AND INTERESTS </p><p>FOLLOWING THE OPM/SANG, KHOBAR TOWERS, EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS, AND A </p><p>SPECIFIC THREAT TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IN OCTOBER 1998.  IT MADE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO COALITION FORCES THE PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE AT AL </p><p>KHARJ, WHERE MOST U.S. SERVICEMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE NOW LOCATED, </p><p>AND A RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND, KNOWN AS ESKAN VILLAGE, SOUTH OF RIYADH </p><p>FOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DOD PERSONNEL.  THE SAG SPENT MILLIONS OF </p><p>DOLLARS IN FACILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE </p><p>SECURITY.  THE SAG ALSO WORKED WITH AMERICAN SECURITY PERSONNEL TO </p><p>ENHANCE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AT ALL OTHER USG FACILITIES IN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA, INCLUDING THE U.S. EMBASSY IN RIYADH AND THE CONSULATES </p><p>GENERAL IN JEDDAH AND DHAHRAN.  USG AND SAG OFFICIALS FROM THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVELS DOWN CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY TO REVIEW THE SAFETY </p><p>OF AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>K.   IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION DURING </p><p>THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF TERRORISM </p><p>AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO </p><p>WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING IN </p><p>PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN THE </p><p>HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: THE SAG HAS PROVIDED TO THE USG INFORMATION ON THREATS </p><p>DIRECTED AT U.S. INTERESTS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND CONTINUES TO LIAISE </p><p>CLOSELY WITH USG AGENCIES TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>AMERICANS IN THE KINGDOM.  REPORTED THREATS HAVE REGULARLY LED TO </p><p>THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF EXTRA SECURITY PERSONNEL AND THE PLACEMENT </p><p>OF PERMANENT PHYSICAL BARRIERS, CHECKPOINTS, AND OTHER VISIBLE </p><p>DETERRENTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOWLER </p><p></p></div>
