<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001293 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, NI, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER DISCOURAGED ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1047 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Joseph G. Sullivan for reasons 1.5b/d </p><p> </p><p> 1.(C) Nigerian High Commissioner Wilberforce Juta portrayed </p><p>the stalemate in Zimbabwe along lines similar to those of </p><p>reftel.  Juta believed that President Mugabe had backed away </p><p>from agreements reached during the May visit of the </p><p>Presidents of Nigeria, South Africa and Malawi.  He expressed </p><p>frustration that the efforts of his President were not being </p><p>reciprocated by the GOZ.  He considered the GOZ economic </p><p>policies disastrous irredeemable without a political </p><p>solution.  Juta believed that internal ZANU-PF rivalries and </p><p>ethnic considerations explained some of ZANU\'s unwillingness </p><p>to make a transition or face a near-term election.  According </p><p>to Juta, the Nigerian Government was discouraged about the </p><p>prospects for near-term resolution of the political crisis. </p><p>Nonetheless, he said that President Obasanjo continued to </p><p>maintain frequent contact with President Mbeki on Zimbabwe </p><p>and remained interested in a positive solution. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) With respect to internal ZANU-PF politics, HC Juta </p><p>thought there were increasing support for Party Chairman John </p><p>Nkomo as a successor to Mugabe.  Choosing an Ndebele as an </p><p>interim leader would avoid contests among Shona contenders </p><p>and yet would clearly have interim status since an Ndebele </p><p>would not be accepted as a long-term leader of the party. </p><p>Juta also commented that ZANU-PF continued to regard </p><p>transition as an internal ZANU-PF matter and to regard the </p><p>MDC merely as a side matter to be accommodated. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment:  Juta has regularly been more critical of </p><p>President Mugabe and ZANU-PF to us than has been his </p><p>Government in Abuja.  He will soon conclude his mission here </p><p>in Harare after five years. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
