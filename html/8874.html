<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001554 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL, DRL/PHD, and DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, PGOV, SOCI, VM, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT:  Khmer and Cham in Vietnam  -- </p><p>-            Minorities by Ethnicity and Faith </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  The Mekong Delta province of An Giang on </p><p>the Cambodian border is home to members of all of Vietnam\'s </p><p>recognized religious faiths and two of its larger ethnic </p><p>minorities, the Khmer and the Cham.  The Khmer follow </p><p>Theravada Buddhism, while most Vietnamese Buddhists belong </p><p>to the Mahayana tradition common in Northeast Asia.  An </p><p>Giang\'s Cham Muslim community is one of several scattered </p><p>around the Mekong Delta and south-central coastal Vietnam. </p><p>Both groups seem able to maintain their languages, </p><p>religions, and traditions, but also appear to avoid </p><p>undertaking actions that might be seen as controversial. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Khmer Theravada Buddhists </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Tri Ton District in southwestern An Giang is home </p><p>to about 51,700 ethnic Khmer people, 47 percent of the total </p><p>district population.  Many of them appear to speak the Khmer </p><p>language at home and in town.  The distinctive, colorful, </p><p>Cambodian-style pagodas clearly mark Khmer communities. </p><p>Despite the difference between the Mahayana and Theravada </p><p>traditions, members of both belong to the Vietnam Buddhist </p><p>Sangha, the GVN-recognized Buddhist organization.  DCM and </p><p>delegation, along with several provincial officials, visited </p><p>a Khmer Buddhist temple in Tri Ton District, An Giang on May </p><p>20 and spoke with the head monk, Reverend Chau Ti.  He spoke </p><p>no Vietnamese, only Khmer, although he has lived in Vietnam </p><p>his whole life, 57 years. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Reverend Ti described the situation for Khmer in </p><p>Tri Ton district.  They have lived in the area for "several </p><p>generations."  A few people fled to Tri Ton from Cambodia </p><p>during the Khmer Rouge period, but have long since returned, </p><p>he claimed.  The Khmer language is taught at an ethnic </p><p>minority boarding school in the district center, and there </p><p>are other Khmer programs in Soc Trang and Tra Vinh </p><p>provinces.  However, there is a shortage of Khmer-speaking </p><p>teachers, especially in remote villages.  Monks also teach </p><p>the Khmer language at pagodas, as permitted by authorities. </p><p>Reverend Ti also said that local authorities also support </p><p>Khmer festivals and denied allegations that the GVN </p><p>suppresses the Khmer language and culture.  There is some </p><p>radio programming in Khmer and some regulations are printed </p><p>in Khmer.  Khmer language textbooks are published in Soc </p><p>Trang.  Reverend Ti added that he uses Buddhist texts </p><p>published in Cambodia brought to Vietnam by businessmen. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Reverend Ti pointed out that Theravada Buddhism is </p><p>practiced somewhat differently now than in the past.  The </p><p>tradition of mendicant monks is less common.  Currently, </p><p>those monks who wish to go from house to house to seek food </p><p>do so from 10:00AM until noon.  They eat after that and then </p><p>fast until the following morning.  Some men still become </p><p>monks temporarily.  Pagodas used to take in the community\'s </p><p>orphans, who would then live in the temples.  However, </p><p>because "socio-economic conditions are better" and because </p><p>the GVN takes care of orphans, he said, the pagodas no </p><p>longer undertake this role.  Nonetheless, some "homeless" </p><p>children, apparently in their teens, do come to the pagoda </p><p>and stay there, he claimed.  Mission officers encountered </p><p>several such teens helping out at the pagoda on the day of </p><p>their visit. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  While Reverend Ti said he has no contact with monks </p><p>in Cambodia, he regularly associates with other monks in </p><p>Vietnam, both Khmer Theravada and Kinh Mahayana.  Relations </p><p>between the followers of the two branches are fine, he </p><p>declared.  He had attended the tenth anniversary celebration </p><p>of the provincial Buddhist association at a Kinh temple in </p><p>Chau Doc that morning.  One difference between followers of </p><p>the two traditions is that Mahayana initiates study in </p><p>Buddhist academies, while Khmer initiates study under senior </p><p>monks at local pagodas.  The respective ranking systems of </p><p>monks are similar, however, he said. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The pagoda that DCM and delegation visited has four </p><p>monks.  The current structure dates from 1980.  It replaced </p><p>another pagoda of the same name that had been built in about </p><p>1910, but subsequently destroyed.  About 7,000 Khmer live in </p><p>the surrounding commune, according to Reverend Ti. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Cham Muslims </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Almost 20 Muslim followers warmly received DCM, his </p><p>delegation, and several provincial officials at the Phu Hiep </p><p>village mosque on May 20.  They introduced themselves by </p><p>title, rather than name, and included the local community </p><p>chief, the deputy chief, and the village\'s Imam.  About </p><p>17,000 Chams live in An Giang, the chief said.  Most of the </p><p>people in the village are Cham Muslims whose ancestors had </p><p>migrated there after "wars" with the Kinh.  Non-Muslims who </p><p>marry Muslims must convert to Islam to be accepted by the </p><p>community.  If they do not, the couple usually moves away. </p><p>Young people who leave the area usually move to other places </p><p>with Muslim communities, including Ho Chi Minh City, they </p><p>said.  The community also participates in cultural events </p><p>and festivals with Cham Muslims elsewhere in Vietnam, </p><p>especially in nearby Tay Ninh province, according to the </p><p>chief.  The Cham language is very similar to those of the </p><p>Roglai and the Ede minorities in the Central Highlands and </p><p>is also closely related to Malay, they added.  Several of </p><p>the Muslims told mission officers that they had more than </p><p>one "wife," but only one official wife under Vietnamese law. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  The mosque in Phu Hiep was established in 1750 and </p><p>has been renovated four times, most recently in 1967.  The </p><p>GVN declared the mosque a historic relic in 1989, according </p><p>to the deputy chief.  About 500 households with a total of </p><p>2129 people use the mosque.  The Imam pointed out that the </p><p>mosque is two kilometers from the Cambodian border and </p><p>recalled that Pol Pot\'s forces had destroyed five mosques in </p><p>An Giang and damaged several others. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  The Muslim leaders credited the GVN, and more </p><p>specifically local authorities, for improvements in living </p><p>conditions after "liberation" in 1975.  They also expressed </p><p>thanks for charitable donations from Australia, Malaysia, </p><p>and the U.S. that have helped overcome the consequences of </p><p>heavy flooding during the past three years.  The Imam </p><p>highlighted help from U.S. veterans groups and former </p><p>Ambassador Peterson.  He also mentioned that they were happy </p><p>that Vietnam had re-established relations with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  The Phu Hiep community has developed ties with </p><p>overseas Muslims in recent years.  Since 1994, several </p><p>elementary and secondary students have gone to Malaysia and </p><p>a few to Indonesia to study the Koran and other subjects. </p><p>The Imam and the deputy chief said that there are currently </p><p>eleven such students overseas.  Sponsors in those countries </p><p>pay for their education and may pay for university education </p><p>overseas as well.  The Imam said he expects the students to </p><p>return and work in Phu Hiep.  The Imam was one of the first </p><p>from the village in recent years to undertake the Hajj; </p><p>about 50 others have followed, including three this year. </p><p>Most, if not all, have been sponsored by the Saudi royal </p><p>family, he claimed. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Activities at the mosque itself include the cycle </p><p>of five daily prayers from 4:30AM until 8:00PM, Friday noon </p><p>prayers, and classes every day but Friday.  There are four </p><p>teachers, two male and two female.  They hold classes for </p><p>two hours a day on the Koran, and for Arabic and Malay.  The </p><p>Imam clarified that students learn Malay in preparation for </p><p>possible study in Malaysia, but that no teachers from </p><p>overseas come to the mosque.  Another object for their </p><p>studies is to prepare for Koran reading competitions.  The </p><p>winners of these competitions are invited to go to Malaysia, </p><p>Thailand, and Brunei, according to the chief. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Contrary to some reports, it does not appear that </p><p>GVN authorities are attempting to suppress the Khmer </p><p>language and culture in An Giang.  The Khmer whom Mission </p><p>officers encountered appeared relaxed and able to practice </p><p>Khmer customs at will.  Khmer pagodas appeared to be in good </p><p>repair and the provincial government includes Khmer </p><p>officials.  Khmer communities appear to be somewhat poorer </p><p>than those elsewhere in An Giang, but they are decidedly </p><p>better off, at least in economic terms, than their brethren </p><p>across the border in Cambodia.  DCM and the monk had some </p><p>opportunity to speak directly to each other in Khmer and the </p><p>monk came across as uninhibited and forthright. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  The Cham Muslim community leaders adopted a </p><p>uniformly positive tone to describe their current situation </p><p>and their attitude towards both the GVN and USG.  The </p><p>community\'s ties to Malaysia and Indonesia are more </p><p>extensive than Mission had known, but are not entirely </p><p>unexpected.  Other religious groups in Vietnam including </p><p>Buddhists, Catholics, and Protestants also send members </p><p>overseas for religious education, although not at such a </p><p>young age.  The Chams appear to shy away from activities </p><p>that may seem controversial and show no sign of being </p><p>influenced by Islamic fundamentalism.  It is encouraging </p><p>that local authorities allow and perhaps even encourage both </p><p>groups to provide education, including language instruction, </p><p>at religious institutions. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
