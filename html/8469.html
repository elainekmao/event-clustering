<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001133 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS AND AF/S RAYNOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MASS ACTION IN ZIM; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Editorials in the June 4 editions of the two national </p><p>      dailies - the independent  "Daily News" and the government- </p><p>      controlled  "Herald," continue to focus on the on-going </p><p>      nationwide anti-government protests that are expected to </p><p>      end on Friday, June 6.  The demonstrations, organized by </p><p>      the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), have </p><p>      kept the country at a standstill since Monday.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Crushing protests not the solution" </p><p>      the independent daily "The Daily News" (06/04) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "In forcefully crushing the street protests of the </p><p>      opposition MDC this week, President Robert Mugabe\'s </p><p>      government also unwittingly tied a burdensome and </p><p>      tricky knot around its neck.  By authorizing the </p><p>      deployment of thousands of army troops and police to </p><p>      snuff out the protests just as they were being </p><p>      launched, the government could find itself facing a </p><p>      dilemma of when to pull out these forces from the </p><p>      streets, if at all. . .Indeed, can the use of </p><p>      military might alone buy the government more time in </p><p>      power, in the face of overwhelming public discontent </p><p>      with its rule. . .?  Unfortunately, the hardening </p><p>      positions of both the government and the MDC, let </p><p>      alone the poisoned timing, do not favor meaningful </p><p>      inter-party talks that must necessarily focus on </p><p>      governance issues that have triggered Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      collapse. . .A harsh military clampdown on protests </p><p>      by concerned citizens certainly does not offer a </p><p>      lasting solution." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Tsvangirai overestimating popularity" </p><p>      the government-controlled daily "The Herald" (06/04) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "Monday marked the beginning of what MDC leader </p><p>      Morgan Tsvangirai and his Western handlers hoped </p><p>      would be a week of mass demonstrations tailored to </p><p>      topple the democratically elected government of </p><p>      President Robert Mugabe.  Well, that did not happen </p><p>      and once again Tsvangirai was left with egg in the </p><p>      face.  His Western handlers, who we understand </p><p>      poured billions of dollars into the futile exercise, </p><p>      must be particularly red in the face. . .No, </p><p>      Tsvangirai, Zimbabweans don\'t need your </p><p>      sacrifice. . .We think Tsvangirai is overestimating </p><p>      his popularity and fear that he will get a nasty </p><p>      jolt come presidential polls in 2008.  We join other </p><p>      peace-loving Zimbabweans in congratulating our </p><p>      security forces for rising to the occasion and </p><p>      ensuring that misguided elements do not rampage </p><p>      through our cities, destroying property and looting, </p><p>      as is their wont." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
