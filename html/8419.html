Summary and Action Request:  The Permanent Court of </p><p>Arbitration hosted a seminar to explore whether </p><p>international arbitration is a suitable mechanism for </p><p>resolving claims involving Nazi-looted art.  Legal experts </p><p>agreed that arbitration could play a useful role and some </p><p>advocated establishment of a standing arbitral body to </p><p>handle such disputes. Art historians stressed that support </p><p>for high quality archival research was a key element in </p><p>establishing provenance and resolving claims.  The PCA will </p><p>convene a small working group of interested legal experts to </p><p>consider next steps.  The PCA would welcome the </p><p>participation of a USG expert in the process should we wish </p><p>to identify one. We would appreciate guidance on how to </p><p>respond to PCA\'s invitation for USG participation on the </p><p>working group.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) </p><p>brought together international legal experts and art </p><p>historians on May 23 in a seminar to discuss resolution of </p><p>cultural property disputes.  The purpose of the seminar - </p><p>which focused on claims associated with Nazi-looted art - </p><p>was to identify the key issues in resolving stolen art </p><p>claims and consider whether international arbitration </p><p>mechanisms could play a useful role. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Several of the legal experts (including Owen Pell of the </p><p>law firm White and Case and Hans Das of the Catholic </p><p>University of Leuven) argued that national dispute </p><p>settlement measures are inadequate as they often turn on the </p><p>sheer happenstance of where the art has come to rest - with </p><p>some jurisdictions completely precluding recovery.  Legal </p><p>experts were also confident of finding acceptable ways to </p><p>bridge systemic differences between countries with civil law </p><p>and common law systems regarding issues such as evidentiary </p><p>standards, burdens of proof, and applicability of </p><p>purchasers\' good faith.  These legal experts suggested that </p><p>a standing arbitral body modeled on that modeled on the Law </p><p>of the Sea Convention could play an important role in </p><p>resolving Holocaust and other stolen art-related disputes. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Some conference participants were not convinced that </p><p>establishment of an international arbitration mechanism is </p><p>necessary or worthwhile.  While not directly conveying these </p><p>misgivings during the public sessions, they told us on the </p><p>margins that most cases are being adequately handled through </p><p>national or alternative dispute settlement mechanisms and </p><p>that only a handful of cases would ever be referred for </p><p>international arbitration. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Art historians underscored that a relatively complete </p><p>accounting of World War Two-era looted art can only come </p><p>about through more extensive and higher quality archival </p><p>research.  This requires familiarity not only with the </p><p>location of relevant archives but their organizational </p><p>structures and recordkeeping quirks.  Extensive online </p><p>databases, one historian noted, are of limited value because </p><p>of the inconsistent and imprecise manner in which individual </p><p>works are described and recorded.  Several historians noted </p><p>the specialized nature of provenance research and that only </p><p>a handful of people currently have the training and </p><p>background.  They also cited European privacy laws as </p><p>obstacles to tracking down looted art and establishing </p><p>provenance. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment:  Although the PCA has not taken an </p><p>institutional position on whether international arbitration </p><p>is a suitable mechanism for resolving claims involving Nazi- </p><p>looted art, PCA officials have determined that additional </p><p>work to explore this possibility would be valuable.  PCA </p><p>General Counsel Freedburg noted that the PCA intends to </p><p>convene a small working group of experts to consider next </p><p>steps and indicated that the group would include experts </p><p>from American law firms and art museums such as the National </p><p>Gallery of Art.  She said the PCA would welcome the </p><p>participation of a USG expert in the process should we wish </p><p>to identify one.  End Comment </p><p> </p><p>Sobel </p><p></p></div>
