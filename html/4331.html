<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 002158 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, NP, XD </p><p>SUBJECT: SAARC: SECRETARIAT COMMENTS ON LATEST COUNCIL FOR </p><p>ECONOMIC COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by Ambassador Michael Malinowski, Reason 1.5( </p><p>d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On November 14, the Economic Officer met with Rajiv </p><p>Chander, Director of Trade Economic and Transportation </p><p>Division of the South Asia Association for Regional </p><p>Cooperation (SAARC) and an Indian national, to discuss the </p><p>recent meeting of the Committee on Economic Cooperation </p><p>(CEC). Mr. Chander did not see evidence of Indian demands on </p><p>Pakistan during the CEC proceedings. Although India and </p><p>Pakistan did not agree to any trade preferences at the </p><p>session, Mr. Chander saw progress through a commitment for </p><p>representatives to meet late November, and perhaps again in </p><p>December, to finalizing the South Asia Free Trade Area </p><p>framework for presentation in January. The Secretariat is </p><p>also prepared for the Twelfth Summit as scheduled and making </p><p>provisions for postponement, rather than a cancellation. </p><p> </p><p>Accomplishments </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On November 14, the Economic Officer met with Rajiv </p><p>Chander, Director of Trade Economic and Transportation </p><p>Division of the South Asia Association for Regional </p><p>Cooperation (SAARC) and an Indian national, to discuss the </p><p>recent meeting of the Committee on Economic Cooperation </p><p>(CEC). The CEC, made up of the Commerce or Trade Secretaries </p><p>of the member states, met for the eleventh time in Kathmandu </p><p>from October 26-27. The CEC concluded the fourth round of the </p><p>South Asia Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA), which </p><p>will be implemented in six months; set dates for the </p><p>preparation of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) </p><p>tentatively scheduled for the end of November; and set Dhaka </p><p>as the host for the fifth SAARC Trade Fair. </p><p> </p><p>Indo-Pak Discussions </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During the CEC discussions, Pakistan and India were </p><p>unable to come to any agreement on trade concessions under </p><p>the SAPTA framework. Mr. Chander did not participate in the </p><p>bilateral meeting, but he did not see the Indian delegation </p><p>present any preconditions for Indian participation in the </p><p>January Summit. He views the commitment to meet at the end of </p><p>November to finalize SAFTA as a positive sign. The CEC </p><p>members also committed to a follow-on meeting in December to </p><p>finalize the effort. (Comment: If press reports on New </p><p>Dehli\'s statements are accurate, the Prime Minister has </p><p>demanded Pakistan grant India Most Favored Nation Status as a </p><p>sign of progress in economic cooperation and a condition for </p><p>Indian participation in the Twelfth SAARC Summit. While these </p><p>statements were not reiterated in Kathmandu, it is possible </p><p>that progess on SAFTA may substitute for demands made on Most </p><p>Favored Nation Status.) </p><p> </p><p>Prospects for the Twelfth SAARC Summit </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Secretariat is fully prepared for the Summit as </p><p>scheduled. Provisions are being made for a delay in the </p><p>proceedings, but not for their cancellation. Mr. Chander did </p><p>not see this period as a return of the "dark days of SAARC," </p><p>the period from 1999 to 2001 when no summit took place due to </p><p>Indo-Pak bilateral tensions. Rather, he believes that </p><p>postponement of the proceedings is more likely, with the </p><p>Secretariat is already making provisional plans for just such </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>a contingency. Other activities of the SAARC technical </p><p>committees continue, including the development of a </p><p>agriculture program and a forum discussing the impact on </p><p>South Asia with the sunset of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement in </p><p>2005. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Despite Mr. Chander\'s position as facilitator during </p><p>the recent CEC meeting, he was unwilling to provide a candid </p><p>view of the Indo-Pak bilateral relationship. This falls in </p><p>line with the Secretariat\'s unassertive stance on bilateral </p><p>issues, which it defines rather broadly. SAARC continues to </p><p>present opportunities for bilateral dialogue for all member </p><p>states, particularly India and Pakistan. However, it lacks a </p><p>recognized role as a mediator and does not have a history of </p><p>holding member states to prior agreements as a condition for </p><p>future talks. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
