IRVING, REASON 1.5 (B), (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  DCM AND POLOFF CALLED ON GIDEON GONO, </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE COMMERCIAL BANK OF ZIMBABWE (CBZ), </p><p>SEPTEMBER 25 TO GET AN UPDATE ON ZIMBABWE\'S FUEL </p><p>SITUATION.  AS REPORTED REF B, THE CBZ, AND GONO </p><p>PERSONALLY, HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN KEEPING FUEL </p><p>FLOWING INTO ZIMBABWE UNDER THE MOST ARDUOUS OF </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES.  GONO OFFERED SOME HOPE THAT THE FUEL </p><p>CRISIS HAS PEAKED, AND THAT THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE (NOCZIM) PARASTATAL THAT HAS CAUSED MUCH OF THE </p><p>MISERY WILL LOSE ITS PROCUREMENT MONOPOLY BY THE END OF </p><p>THE YEAR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DCM AND POLOFF CALLED ON GIDEON GONO, MANAGING </p><p>DIRECTOR AND CEO OF THE COMMERCIAL BANK OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>(CBZ), SEPTEMBER 25 TO GET AN UPDATE ON ZIMBABWE\'S FUEL </p><p>SITUATION.  GONO OUTLINED THE CBZ\'S ROLE IN SECURING NEW </p><p>SOURCES OF FUEL EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>TRADITIONAL CREDITORS TURNED OFF THE TAPS.  WHEN NOCZIM </p><p>MISMANAGEMENT AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE SHORTFALLS LED TO </p><p>CRITICAL FUEL SHORTAGES IN FEBRUARY, GONO EMBARKED ON A </p><p>SERIES OF TRIPS TO LIBYA, EGYPT, DUBAI, AND KUWAIT.  THE </p><p>FIRST THREE DECLINED TO HELP GONO, BUT KUWAIT\'S </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM GROUP (IPG) OFFERED SOME HOPE. </p><p>GONO ACCOMPANIED PRESIDENT MUGABE AND THEN ENERGY </p><p>MINISTER ENOS CHIKOWORE TO KUWAIT IN MARCH, AND IPG SET </p><p>UP A US$30 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR FUEL, </p><p>ACCORDING TO GONO. AT IPG\'S REQUEST, CBZ GUARANTEED THE </p><p>DEAL ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS; IN EXCHANGE, NOCZIM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05397  01 OF 02  261404Z </p><p>DEPOSITED ITS CASH WITH THE CBZ.  THE DEAL PROVIDED SOME </p><p>TEMPORARY RELIEF TO ZIMBABWE\'S FUEL WOES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NEW PROBLEMS SOON SURFACED, HOWEVER, WHEN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S SPECIAL FUEL BOND WAS ONLY 50 PERCENT </p><p>SUBSCRIBED.  ZIMBABWE\'S FOREIGN FUEL SUPPLIERS BECAME </p><p>VERY NERVOUS WHEN THEY SAW THAT NOCZIM COULD NOT </p><p>CONVINCE LOCAL BANKS TO BUY THE BONDS.  THE FOREIGN </p><p>SUPPLIERS STARTED TO PUT THE SQUEEZE ON NOCZIM AND CBZ, </p><p>AND FUEL SUPPLIES STARTED TO DWINDLE AGAIN.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT BECAME DISENCHANTED WITH CBZ, AND ENDED ITS </p><p>FINANCIAL ADVISORY CONTRACT WITH THE BANK IN JULY.  WHEN </p><p>THE NEW ENERGY MINISTER, SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI, COULD NOT </p><p>FIND NEW FUEL SUPPLIERS FOR NOCZIM, HE SENT AN "S.O.S." </p><p>TO CBZ IN AUGUST, GONO SAID (REF B).  THE CBZ CONVINCED </p><p>BRITISH PETROLEUM, WHICH HAS THE LARGEST RETAIL NETWORK </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE, TO RELEASE FUEL FROM ITS STORAGE FACILITY </p><p>IN GWERU.  WITHIN TWO WEEKS, GONO HAD EASED THE FUEL </p><p>CRISIS AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) GONO HAS SINCE INVITED FUEL SUPPLIERS, SUCH AS IPG </p><p>AND SOUTH AFRICA\'S ENGEN AND SASOL, TO COME MEET MUGABE </p><p>PERSONALLY IN AN EFFORT TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  THIS LED TO THE NEW FUEL DEAL REPORTED REF A </p><p>BETWEEN NOCZIM, THE ZIMBABWE MINISTRY OF MINES AND </p><p>ENERGY, SOUTH AFRICA\'S ENGEN (26 PERCENT STAKEHOLDER IN </p><p>CBZ, AND ITSELF 80 PERCENT OWNED BY PETRONAS OF </p><p>MALAYSIA), CBZ, AND METROPOLITAN BANK.  GONO ELABORATED </p><p>THAT THE DEAL INVOLVES A US$50 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT </p><p>FACILITY THAT IS TIED TO EXPORT EARNINGS ON SPECIFIC </p><p>COMMODITIES, SUCH AS COTTON AND TOBACCO.  THE CREDIT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05397  01 OF 02  261404Z </p><p>SCHEME INCLUDES A $25 MILLION 90-DAY AND A $25 MILLION </p><p>360-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT LINE (REF A).  CBZ HELPED TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE THE 360-DAY FACILITY WITH MALAYSIA DIRECTLY, </p><p>AND IT HAS HELPED TO RESTART THE IPG FACILITY, WHICH HAD </p><p>BEEN SUSPENDED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ON THE FATE OF NOCZIM, GONO STATED THAT IT IS ON </p><p>ITS WAY TO BECOMING SOLELY A REGULATING BODY WITH NO </p><p>PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY.  ACCORDING TO THE GOZ\'S CURRENT </p><p>THINKING, ZIMBABWE\'S FUEL IMPORTERS WOULD HAVE THE </p><p>FREEDOM TO BUY FUEL DIRECTLY AT MARKET PRICES AND CUT </p><p>OUT THE NOCZIM MIDDLEMAN.  THE GOVERNMENT WOULD STILL </p><p>HAVE A HAND IN DETERMINING FUEL PRICES, USING THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN GOVERNMENT\'S FORMULA (NFI) THAT WOULD ENSURE NO </p><p>LOSSES TO THE STATE OR SUPPLIERS.  NOCZIM\'S STAFF IS TO </p><p>BE REDUCED FROM 200 TO 15, AND IT IS TO MOVE OUT OF ITS </p><p>SEVEN-STORY HEADQUARTERS, GONO STATED.  WHEN ASKED HOW </p><p>LONG NOCZIM HAD LEFT, GONO FELT THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY DISSOLVED BY THE END OF THE YEAR, BUT NOTED </p><p>COYLY THAT THERE WERE STILL POLITICAL OBSTACLES TO </p><p>OVERCOME.  IN ANY CASE, GONO FELT THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE </p><p>TO MAINTAIN THE REPRIEVE FROM ZIMBABWE\'S FUEL TROUBLES </p><p>FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7156 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05397  02 OF 02  261404Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  DS-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  OES-01   ACE-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    EPAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /004W </p><p>                  ------------------89FEC2  261405Z /38 </p><p>O 261404Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7191 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY KUWAIT IMMEDIATE </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USDOC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 005397 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/26/05 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PGOV, PREL, PINR, ECON, SENV, ZI, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE BANK DIRECTOR PROVIDES SOME HOPE FOR </p><p>MORE STEADY FUEL SUPPLIES </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05397  02 OF 02  261404Z </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  GONO WAS MORE CIRCUMSPECT WITH US THAN </p><p>IN HIS DINNER CONVERSATION A FEW WEEKS AGO IN WHICH HE </p><p>DESCRIBED ENERGY MINISTER SEKERAMAYI SENDING LETTERS TO </p><p>NOCZIM REQUESTING A CUT OF ANY NEW FUEL DEAL (REF B). </p><p>THIS IS LIKELY THE "POLITICAL OBSTACLE" THAT GONO WAS </p><p>REFERRING TO.  EVEN IF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUE </p><p>SKIMMING OFF OF THE COUNTRY\'S FUEL TROUBLES, IT APPEARS </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE HAS SECURED ENOUGH FOREIGN FINANCIAL </p><p>BACKING TO TEMPORARILY STAVE OFF THE CONSTANT FUEL </p><p>DISRUPTIONS THAT HAVE PLAGUED IT FOR THE LAST TEN </p><p>MONTHS.  QUEUES AT LOCAL PETROL OUTLETS HAVE BEEN </p><p>NOTICEABLY SHORTER SINCE THE SEPTEMBER 22 FUEL DEAL WAS </p><p>ANNOUNCED.  WHETHER ZIMBABWE HAS FOUND A MORE LASTING </p><p>SOLUTION WILL DEPEND ON THE POLITICAL WILL OF MUGABE AND </p><p>THE ENERGY MINISTER TO DISSOLVE THE CORRUPT AND BADLY </p><p>MANAGED NOCZIM.  THAT MAY PROVE DIFFICULT IF THE NEW </p><p>ENERGY MINISTER AND OTHERS LIKE HIM CANNOT WEAN </p><p>THEMSELVES FROM THE BLOATED PARASTATAL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) BIO NOTE: GONO WAS BORN IN BUHERA, MANICALAND </p><p>PROVINCE, ZIMBABWE ON NOVEMBER 29, 1959.  HE IS MARRIED </p><p>AND HAS FOUR CHILDREN AGES 18, 16 (TWIN GIRLS), AND 4. </p><p>HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF IN HORATIO ALGER TERMS, STARTING </p><p>OUT AS A TEA-MAKER/CLEANER AT A LARGE COMPANY, WHO USED </p><p>HIS PAYCHECK TO PUT HIMSELF THROUGH SCHOOL FROM GRADE </p><p>SCHOOL TO UNIVERSITY.  GONO HINTED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>RECENTLY SOUNDED HIM OUT FOR A CABINET APPOINTMENT, </p><p>WHICH HE TURNED DOWN ("THE HARDEST DECISION OF MY </p><p>LIFE").  THE BANK MANAGING DIRECTOR CLAIMS HE HAS NO </p><p>POLITICAL AMBITIONS ("YET") BUT DOES WANT TO GALVANIZE A </p><p>REPUTATION AS A CORPORATE TURNAROUND EXPERT, WHICH HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05397  02 OF 02  261404Z </p><p>HAS APPLIED TO CBZ, ONCE INSOLVENT BUT NOW ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>THIRD-LARGEST BANK.  GONO HOPES TO COMPLETELY PRIVATIZE </p><p>THE BANK (THE GOZ IS THE 20 PERCENT SILENT SHAREHOLDER) </p><p>AND LIST IT ON THE NASDAQ.  THE CBZ MANAGING DIRECTOR IS </p><p>CLOSE TO PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HAS A CHECKERED REPUTATION </p><p>IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
