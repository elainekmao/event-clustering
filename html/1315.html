(C) DURING A ONE AND A HALF HOUR BRIEFING OF </p><p>SELECTED HEADS OF MISSION OCTOBER 11, THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT SECRETARY AND GOVERNMENT POINT </p><p>OF CONTACT FOR DONORS ON QUESTION ON LAND REFORM, </p><p>WILLARD CHIWEWE, ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO EMBARK ON THE </p><p>FAST TRACK LAND RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE.  THE SENIOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID THAT TO DO OTHERWISE WOULD RISK </p><p>POLITICAL INSTABILITY.  HE ARGUED THAT THE FAST TRACK </p><p>APPROACH IS ESSENTIALLY AN ACCELERATED VERSION OF THE </p><p>INCEPTION PHASE AGREED TO BY DONORS AND THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AT THE 1998 LAND DONORS\' CONFERENCE, AND HAD </p><p>AS ITS PURPOSE BRINGING THE RURAL POOR INTO THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC MAINSTREAM.

CHIWEWE STATED THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE INTENDS TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW, ALTHOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DO SO, AS CURRENT LAND </p><p>TENURE AND PROPERTY LAW DID NOT FAVOR THE DISPOSSESSED. </p><p>DONOR REPRESENTATIVES PRESENT TOOK EXCEPTION TO THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT\'S TRAMPLING HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW IN ITS QUEST TO SATISFY THIS POLITICAL </p><p>IMPERATIVE.  CHIWEWE\'S INVITATION TO DIALOGUE WAS </p><p>DEFIANT AND CASUISTIC BUT MARKED THE FIRST STEP THIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN IN THAT DIRECTION IN A LONG TIME. </p><p>IN SPITE OF THE PERMANENT SECRETARY\'S EXPLANATION, WE </p><p>REMAIN SKEPTICAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS A REAL LAND </p><p>REFORM PLAN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT SECRETARY </p><p>WILLARD CHIWEWE ON OCTOBER 11 INVITED HEADS OF MISSION </p><p>FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION TROIKA, MEMBERS OF THE SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY, THE JAPANESE CHARGE </p><p>D\'AFFAIRES AND AMEMBASSY HARARE\'S CHARGE FOR A 90-MINUTE </p><p>BRIEFING ON THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE. </p><p>CHIWEWE IS THE GOVERNMENT\'S POINT MAN FOR THE UN/UNDP </p><p>MISSION IN TOWN TO EXPLORE COMMON GROUND FOR RESUMING </p><p>DIALOGUE ON TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  THE </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY STARTED BY EXTENDING AN OLIVE </p><p>BRANCH, NOTING THAT HIS REMARKS WERE BQNG MADE IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF THE UN/UNDP MISSION AND WERE MEANT TO SPUR </p><p>MORE MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE DONORS AND HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON THE SUBJECT OF LAND REFORM.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05731  01 OF 04  111811Z </p><p>THE 1998 DONORS\' CONFERENCE ON LAND HAD GENERATED HOPE </p><p>AND EXCITEMENT AS EACH SIDE FELT IT HAD MADE A </p><p>BREAKTHROUGH. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) REGRETTABLY THE EUPHORIA WAS SHORT LIVED, AS THE </p><p>PERIOD OF OCTOBER 1998 TO JUNE 2000 WAS MARKED BY </p><p>INACTIVITY ON THE LAND REFORM FRONT.  CHIWEWE ATTRIBUTED </p><p>THIS TO THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>ENCOUNTERED RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AGGRAVATED BY THE </p><p>"UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT" CREATED BY REMARKS BY THE IMF </p><p>AND WORLD BANK ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC POLICIES. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO RUN OUT OF </p><p>TIME TO PREPARE THE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE INCEPTION PHASE.  BY JUNE 2000, HE </p><p>EXPLAINED, THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO RESPOND TO THE RESULTS </p><p>OF THAT INACTIVITY: FARM OCCUPATIONS BY WAR VETERANS AND </p><p>RESIDENTS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES, WHO COULD NOT TOLERATE </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S TARDINESS IN RESOLVING THIS SOCIAL </p><p>GRIEVANCE.  THE GOVERNMENT THEN FOUND ITSELF HAVING TO </p><p>ACCELERATE THE LAND DELIVERY PROCESS, IN WHICH IT </p><p>ADHERED TO MOST OF THE PRINCIPLES AGREED TO AT THE 1998 </p><p>DONORS\' CONFERENCE, EXCEPT THAT OF WILLING BUYER AND </p><p>WILLING SELLER.  FAST TRACK MEANS THE QUICK </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INCEPTION PHASE, CHIWEWE </p><p>SUMMARIZED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9979 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05731  02 OF 04  111705Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01 </p><p>      SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /013W </p><p>                  ------------------901C44  111705Z /38 </p><p>P 111703Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7339 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 005731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05731  02 OF 04  111705Z </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VNEWTON AND A/AID - RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/11/2010 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, UNDP, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE: MFA </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY WILLARD CHIWEWE EXPLAINS IT ALL </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE PERMANENT SECRETARY STATED THAT AMONG THOSE </p><p>THINGS TO WHICH DONORS AGREED IN 1998 THE FAST TRACK </p><p>APPROACH ENTAILS: </p><p> </p><p>-- FAST LAND IDENTIFICATION AND ACQUISITION OF THE </p><p>REMAINING 5 MILLION HECTARES FOR THE LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM; </p><p> </p><p>-- ONCE IDENTIFIED THE LAND WAS SUBJECTED TO QUICK </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCESS, I.E., THE FARMS WERE </p><p>GAZETTED ACCORDING TO THE LAW; </p><p> </p><p>-- DEMARCATION AND PLACEMENT OF SETTLERS WOULD TAKE </p><p>PLACE SHORTLY; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD BE PROVIDED AND INPUTS SUPPLIED </p><p>TO SETTLERS ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) RETURNING TO THE CONTEXT UNDER WHICH THE FAST </p><p>TRACK OPERATION WAS LAUNCHED, CHIWEWE SAID THE POLITICAL </p><p>SITUATION "DID NOT ALLOW THE LUXURY" TO WAIT UNTIL ALL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05731  02 OF 04  111705Z </p><p>FACTORS WERE IN PLACE FOR AN IDEAL LAND REFORM PROGRAM. </p><p>HE STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE COMMITTED TO </p><p>ACQUIRING LAND OVER THE PERIOD JUNE 2000 TO DECEMBER </p><p>2001 AND PUT SETTLERS ON THAT LAND.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>DECIDED TO APPLY THE LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM AS AN EXERCISE IN SOVEREIGNTY AND TO FULFIL A </p><p>POLITICAL PROMISE.  THE GOVERNMENT REALIZES THAT THERE </p><p>IS RELUCTANCE AMONG THE DONOR COMMUNITY TO ASSIST WITH </p><p>THE LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM WITH THE SPEED </p><p>NECESSARY, BUT IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD DELIBERATED HOW TO </p><p>ACCOMMODATE THOSE VIEWS, INSTABILITY WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>"UNAVOIDABLE."  THE GOVERNMENT WAS WILLING TO COOPERATE </p><p>WITH MEMBERS OF THE DONOR COMMUNITY, SHARING ITS VISION </p><p>OF LAND REFORM AS A MEANS OF ENSURING SOCIAL JUSTICE AND </p><p>IMPROVED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN A SHORTER PERIOD. </p><p>INDEED, DONOR COMMUNITY COOPERATION WAS NECESSARY TO </p><p>SUSTAIN THE PROGRAM AND THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE WAS </p><p>OPEN TO DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) FINALLY, THE PERMANENT SECRETARY STATED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS AWARE THAT "CERTAIN POWERFUL MEMBERS" OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY VIEWED THE LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF THEIR </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY GOALS.  THEY CALLED ZIMBABWE\'S QUEST FOR </p><p>LAND "MERE POLITICKING," AND "PAID LITTLE REGARD TO" THE </p><p>FAST TRACK PROGRAM.  HE APPEALED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO PUT ASIDE FOREIGN POLICY CONCERNS AND LOOK </p><p>IN SHARP FOCUS AT THE FAST TRACK APPROACH THAT TARGETS </p><p>THE POOR WHO LIVE IN THE CONGESTED AREAS OF THE COMMUNAL </p><p>LANDS.  IT WAS NOT MERELY FOCUSED ON ALLEVIATING </p><p>POVERTY, HE OBSERVED, BUT TO BRING THE RURAL POOR INTO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05731  02 OF 04  111705Z </p><p>THE MAINSTREAM OF THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY AND BECOME </p><p>ACTIVE AGENTS IN THE ELIMINATION OF THEIR OWN POVERTY </p><p>THROUGH LAND OWNERSHIP AND PURPOSEFUL AGRICULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE OBSERVED </p><p>THAT HIS ORGANIZATION STRONGLY SUPPORTED POVERTY </p><p>ALLEVIATION, RECTIFICATION OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES, AND </p><p>THE LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND HIS ORGANIZATION HAD AGREED </p><p>TO PRINCIPLES FOR COOPERATION, BUT FAST TRACK CREATED A </p><p>NEW SITUATION IN WHICH THE DONOR COMMUNITY HAS </p><p>EFFECTIVELY BEEN SIDELINED.  "THIS HAS BECOME AN </p><p>INTERNAL ZIMBABWEAN OPERATION," HE CONCLUDED.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WAS READY FOR DIALOGUE, THIS </p><p>COULD NOT RESUME UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT RESPECTED HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR THANKED CHIWEWE FOR HIS </p><p>"HONEST DESCRIPTION OF THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT" UNDER </p><p>WHICH FAST TRACK WAS LAUNCHED, BUT TOOK ISSUE WITH THE </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY\'S STANCE THAT HIS GOVERNMENT COULD </p><p>"NOT AFFORD THE LUXURY" OF A METHODICALLY IMPLEMENTED </p><p>LAND REFORM PROGRAM.  HE SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>HAPPY WITH THE 1998 DONORS\' CONFERENCE DOCUMENT, BUT NOT </p><p>HAPPY WITH SOME OF THE RESULTS OF FAST TRACK, INCLUDING </p><p>LACK OF DIALOGUE AMONG ZIMBABWEAN STAKEHOLDERS, AND </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9982 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05731  03 OF 04  111705Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /013W </p><p>                  ------------------901C4E  111706Z /38 </p><p>P 111703Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7340 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 005731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05731  03 OF 04  111705Z </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VNEWTON AND A/AID - RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/11/2010 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, UNDP, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE: MFA </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY WILLARD CHIWEWE EXPLAINS IT ALL </p><p> </p><p>PLACING THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE LAST ON THE LIST OF </p><p>THINGS TO ACCOMPLISH.  IF THAT WAS THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>FINAL POSITION, THE DONORS WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY </p><p>SUPPORTING THE PROGRAM.  THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR SAID </p><p>THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR A PARTNERSHIP AND THAT </p><p>PARTNERSHIP ENTAILS DIALOGUE.  THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE, </p><p>HE CONTINUED.  WHILE THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE SAW THAT </p><p>AS A SEPARATE TRACK TO ITS LAND REFORM IMPERATIVE, THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL COME BACK WHEN IT HAS </p><p>MERGED INTO ONE TRACK. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) PREFACING HIS RESPONSE, CHIWEWE SAID THAT, </p><p>REGARDING ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM, "IF WE CAN START FROM SHARING SOCIAL AND </p><p>POLITICAL VALUES, THEN THE MODALITIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>WILL BE EASIER."  HE CONCEDED THAT FAST TRACK WAS AN </p><p>INTERNAL OPERATION TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE DONORS, BUT </p><p>THAT IT WAS NOT OUT OF CHOICE BUT NECESSITY, AND THAT </p><p>THE LAND TRANSFER PROGRAM WAS SUBJECT TO INTERNAL </p><p>WEAKNESSES.  NO SUCH PROCESS WAS ATTEMPTED BETWEEN 1890 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05731  03 OF 04  111705Z </p><p>AND 1980, AND ONLY HALFHEARTEDLY BETWEEN 1980 AND 2000. </p><p>"THOSE OF US IN AN IVORY TOWER CAN THINK OF PERFECTING </p><p>OUR ART WHEN THE PATIENT IS DYING," THE PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY REMARKED, "BUT WHILE WE TRY TO BE PERFECT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>POVERTY ENTRENCHES ITSELF." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT, CHIWEWE CONTINUED, MAY HAVE HAD </p><p>AN EXCUSE FOR DELAYING DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD BUT </p><p>NOT NOW, AFTER THE PROMULGATION OF TWO CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>AMENDMENTS AND THE REVISED LAND ACT IN JUNE 2000.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE RESORTED TO WILLING BUYER AND </p><p>WILLING SELLER WHEN LAND WAS FOR SALE.  HONORING THAT </p><p>PRINCIPLE BUT NOT THE POLITICAL IMPERATIVE OF GIVING </p><p>LAND TO THE LANDLESS WOULD HAVE DESTABILIZED THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  WE DECIDED NOT TO WAIT, TO GO IT ALONE, EVEN </p><p>IF THE PROGRAM LACKED INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.  THE DONORS </p><p>WITHHELD SUPPORT AND LEFT THE GOVERNMENT TO TRUDGE </p><p>ALONG.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SAID THAT "OUR PRESENCE HERE </p><p>TODAY UNDERLINES THE IMPORTANCE WE ATTACH TO DONOR </p><p>COOPERATION." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) TURNING TO RULE OF LAW, CHIWEWE SAID, "WE ARE </p><p>HURT," AS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DID NOT THINK IT </p><p>APPLIED TO RHODESIA AS A COLONY AND THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT WONDERS WHY IT SHOULD BECOME SUCH A CONCERN </p><p>NOW.  HE STATED THAT ZIMBABWE UPHOLDS THE RULE OF LAW, </p><p>BUT IMPLIED THAT LAND TENURE PRACTICES, BACKED BY THE </p><p>LAW, HAVE TRADITIONALLY FAVORED WHITE FARMERS.  HE </p><p>ASSURED HIS LISTENERS THAT ANYONE WHO HAD COMMITTED A </p><p>CRIME IN CONNECTION WITH THE FARM INVASIONS "MUST HAVE </p><p>BEEN APPREHENDED OR IS ON THE POLICE SEARCH LIST."  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05731  03 OF 04  111705Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO BRINGING CRIMINALS TO </p><p>JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) WHILE RULE OF LAW MUST BE RESPECTED, CHIWEWE </p><p>EMPHASIZED, WE CAN\'T SEEK TO RESPECT A LAW THAT SUSTAINS </p><p>AN UNJUST SYSTEM.  WE WILL BE HAPPIER TO DISCUSS THIS </p><p>MATTER WHEN THE PEOPLE ARE ON THE LAND, WHEN THE </p><p>MAJORITY ARE INVOLVED IN THE MAINSTREAM ECONOMY AND </p><p>POVERTY IS NOT EXTERNALLY IMPOSED.  CHIWEWE SAID THAT </p><p>THERE COULD BE NO REVERSAL OF THE SITUATION PRIOR TO </p><p>THAT OF JANUARY 2000.  "THAT\'S IMPOSSIBLE; </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE," HE UNDERSCORED.  IN CLOSING, HE GAVE HIS </p><p>SENSE FROM THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION THAT ON TECHNICAL </p><p>POINTS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE POSITIONS OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT OF THE DONOR COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>13.
