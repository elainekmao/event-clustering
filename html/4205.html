<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 007924 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: TIMELINE TO ESTABLISH NEXT GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>1. Timeline in para 2 lists the sequence of steps to be </p><p>followed as the Justice and Development (AK) Party prepares </p><p>to establish a government in the wake of its Nov. 3 landslide </p><p>election victory.  According to AK officials, assuming that </p><p>President Sezer observes Turkish law and tradition (i.e., </p><p>gives the mandate to form a government to a prime-ministerial </p><p>candidate from the largest party in Parliament, in this case </p><p>AK), the next government can be up and running by early </p><p>December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Timeline: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Nov. 3 election results and distribution of seats </p><p>certified by Supreme Election Board (YSK) by Nov. 17-18. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Within five days (approx. Nov. 22) after YSK announces the </p><p>results, new Parliament convenes, M.P.s take oath. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- As soon as new Parliament is seated, the Turkish President </p><p>is free to bestow the mandate to form the next government. </p><p>By tradition, the mandate goes to the leader of the largest </p><p>party in Parliament.  In AK\'s case party leader Erdogan was </p><p>ruled ineligible to run for parliament and thus cannot be </p><p>Prime Minister during the just-elected Parliament.  AK will </p><p>thus choose a P.M. candidate from among its newly-elected </p><p>majority once Erdogan has had an initial meeting with </p><p>President Sezer Nov. 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- P.M.-designate has 45 days to form a government, during </p><p>which time he submits a proposed cabinet list to the </p><p>President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Once the President approves the proposed cabinet list, the </p><p>new government is constituted (i.e., the 58th government will </p><p>be announced in this case) but does not yet assume powers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- P.M. submits cabinet list and, usually at the same time, </p><p>government\'s draft program to Parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Within seven days of submission of cabinet list, the P.M. </p><p>or his designated minister reads the draft program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- After allowing two days for parliamentary review of the </p><p>program, Parliament begins debate on vote of confidence </p><p>(technically, a vote of confidence on the government\'s draft </p><p>program). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Vote takes place one full day after end of debate; debate </p><p>is of undetermined length; expected to be shorter in the </p><p>current situation, given AK\'s ability to form a one-party </p><p>government with only one party in opposition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Upon winning the vote of confidence, the government </p><p>assumes its functions. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
