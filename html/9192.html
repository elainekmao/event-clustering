<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004240 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: GROWING HOSTILITY TOWARD USG IN WAKE OF N. </p><p>IRAQ INCIDENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch. Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Despite the release of the Turks detained by </p><p>U.S. forces in Suleimaniye, negative press and public </p><p>reaction to the U.S. operation reached new heights in the </p><p>July 7 morning papers.  The hostile press reaction will </p><p>continue to grow absent a clear and forceful public </p><p>justification for the operation.  The Turkish public\'s sense </p><p>of outrage is amplified and fed by the domestic political </p><p>struggle underway between the AK Government, more traditional </p><p>parties and the military -- and among elements of the </p><p>military leadership -- for primacy of place in policy </p><p>decision-making.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Criticism from U.S. "Friends"... </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) "Hurriyet," Turkey\'s largest-circulation daily, </p><p>described the event on its front page as a "shock" equal to </p><p>that of the 1964 "Johnson letter" which warned Turkey not to </p><p>use U.S. weapons in Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Ertugrul Ozkok, "Hurriyet" editor-in-chief (who strongly </p><p>supported the defeated resolution for U.S. troop </p><p>deployments), characterized the incident as a "fiasco as deep </p><p>as the Bay of Pigs."  Ozkok said the decision to carry out </p><p>the raid was "beyond stupidity" and asserted that by this </p><p>action the U.S. has "lost the best friends it had in Turkey." </p><p> He accuses the  U.S. of "taking revenge" on Turkey by an </p><p>action that goes beyond the limits of "penalizing Turkey" for </p><p>the March 1 vote.  He also urged Turkey to "keep its </p><p>distance" from the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Former P.M. Ecevit asserted to journalists that the U.S. </p><p>was acting "like an enemy" and "provocateur."  Other </p><p>mainstream political leaders -- including the dovish former </p><p>FONMIN Ismail Cem -- seeking to boost their pro-Establishment </p><p>credentials and strike a blow against P.M. Erdogan, have </p><p>roundly criticized the AK Party/Government for its relatively </p><p>mild reaction against the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- All papers highlight the decision of the TGS to withdraw </p><p>its liaison officers from U.S. Centcom Headquarters in Tampa, </p><p>as well as the cancellation of General Hursit Tolon\'s planned </p><p>travel to Centcom for a change of command ceremony.  Calls </p><p>for further Turkish action are gaining strength. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>...And From Other Quarters </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Public reaction was further inflamed by press reports </p><p>from Turkish MFA sources claiming significant damage to the </p><p>Turkish special forces office in Suleymaniye.  An MFA </p><p>official on the scene said that computers, files, several </p><p>vehicles, and 106,000 USD in cash had been taken by U.S. </p><p>forces.  A cook who was initially detained with the special </p><p>forces members described how the prisoners were hooded and </p><p>treated roughly, "just like al-Qaeda militants." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- An ITF representative claimed to Establishment </p><p>standard-bearer "Cumhuriyet" that he had been "tortured" by </p><p>the Americans during his detention. Opposition leaders from </p><p>across the political spectrum demanded that the GOT seek an </p><p>apology from the United States.  Some characterized the raid </p><p>as the action of an "enemy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The influential Islam-influenced "Yeni Safak" launched a </p><p>front-page appeal to the GOT to cancel Turkey\'s purchase of </p><p>four AWACS planes from Boeing.  The deal had already come </p><p>under scrutiny from Parliament\'s anti-corruption committee </p><p>for alleged overcharging and other irregularities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Demanding USG Explain </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Many Turkish commentators note that the U.S. has yet </p><p>to provide any evidence justifying the action.  FM Gul </p><p>claimed that in his two conversations with Secretary Powell, </p><p>the Secretary failed to provide any details on the reasons </p><p>for the action, referring only to unspecified "intelligence </p><p>reports."  Gul described the claim that Turkish forces were </p><p>involved in a plot to assassinate an official in Kirkuk as </p><p>"absolute nonsense."  Following his conversation with Vice </p><p>President Cheney, PM Erdogan issued a statement claiming that </p><p>the Vice President had declined to give any explanation of </p><p>the incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Gen. Ozkok Speaks </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Immediately after his farewell meeting with </p><p>Ambassador, TGS Chief Gen. Hilmi Ozkok announced that the </p><p>requirements of "Turkish national and Turkish military honor" </p><p>should be secured.  He offered that he does not think that </p><p>the incident reflected "United States policy or the policy of </p><p>the U.S. military."  However, Ozkok also asserted that he has </p><p>"difficulty evaluating" the incident as "a purely local </p><p>event." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>The Back Story </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Behind the face-saving bluster, we have picked up </p><p>indications that some Turks privately understand that the </p><p>current crisis was generated in the fist instance by a </p><p>Turkish military -- or elements thereof -- up to something in </p><p>n.Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- "Hurriyet\'s" Cuneyt Ulsever in his July 7 column </p><p>questioned whether the civilian authorities were aware of </p><p>precisely what Turkish forces were doing in Iraq.  He noted </p><p>to us privately on July 6 that, despite what politicians and </p><p>others might be saying, it was understood that the military: </p><p>1) had been up to "something" nefarious in Iraq, and was </p><p>acting on its own; 2) is still smarting from the public </p><p>perception that the USG completely and easily disregarded TGS </p><p>"red lines" in the run-up and during the war; 3) acted out of </p><p>frustration, and to change the perception that the military </p><p>could be easily tilted at by foreign powers and domestic </p><p>political rivals (i.e., ruling AK party); and 4) is "leaking" </p><p>comments to journalists to the effect that "the Turkish </p><p>military will never forget" this incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- An MFA official with long experience in the U.S. and with </p><p>USG-GOT relations privately offered the following assessment: </p><p>1) the incident is a blow to USG-GOT ties, but only a </p><p>temporary set back; 2) the real impact of the affair will be </p><p>felt in Turkish domestic affairs, and will deepen the </p><p>mistrust between the elected civilians and the military; and </p><p>3) that in the end, "the military will be weakened </p><p>politically -- and that this is the silver lining" to the </p><p>crisis, he added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Several political and journalist contacts shared with us </p><p>privately their conviction that the U.S. would not have acted </p><p>without any justification.  Some suggested that the </p><p>activities of the Turkish Special Forces may have been </p><p>planned without the knowledge of the most senior TGS leaders. </p><p> But even they all clearly pulled their punches in pursuing </p><p>this line in print. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The negative press reaction will continue to grow </p><p>until we can offer a clear and forceful public justification </p><p>for the operation -- partly because of the Turkish public\'s </p><p>sense of outrage, but also because of the domestic political </p><p>power struggle underway between the AK Government, more </p><p>traditional parties and the military for primacy of place in </p><p>policy decision-making.  In this context, it is worth keeping </p><p>in mind that the story is breaking against a backdrop not </p><p>only of growing AK-TGS tensions, but of tensions within the </p><p>AK party and in the military itself. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
