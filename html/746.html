<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 BUCHAREST 006434 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINS, RO </p><p>SUBJECT:  ROMANIAN PRESIDENT ION ILIESCU -- A </p><p>POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL-ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY: THIS IS THE FIRST OF TWO CABLES FOCUSING </p><p>ON ROMANIAN PRESIDENT ION ILIESCU, AND COVERS HIS </p><p>POLITICAL HISTORY THROUGH THE 1992 ELECTIONS. </p><p>SEPTEL WILL DEAL WITH HIS CURRENT POWERS AND ROLE IN </p><p>THE ROMANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM.  ILIESCU, WHO WAS </p><p>BORN INTO A COMMUNIST FAMILY IN 1930, ROSE RAPIDLY </p><p>IN THE PARTY HIERARCHY UNTIL HE BEGAN TO CRITICIZE </p><p>THE EXCESSES OF DICTATOR NICOLAE CEAUSESCU IN THE </p><p>EARLY 1970\'S.  ILIESCU THEN EXPERIENCED A SERIES OF </p><p>DEMOTIONS, AND BY 1984 HAD FALLEN TO THE POSITION OF </p><p>DIRECTOR OF AN OBSCURE PUBLISHING HOUSE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HE HAD BECOME KNOWN AS A PARTY DISSIDENT, AND WITH </p><p>THE RISE OF GORBACHEV, ILIESCU BEGAN ADVOCATING AN </p><p>OPENING OF ROMANIAN SOCIETY ALONG THE LINES THEN </p><p>BEING PURSUED IN MOSCOW.  IN THE CHAOS WHICH </p><p>FOLLOWED THE SUDDEN FALL OF THE CEAUSESCU REGIME IN </p><p>DECEMBER, 1989, THE INTELLECTUALS WHO WERE SEEKING </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A NEW POLITICAL ORDER TURNED TO THE </p><p>MORE EXPERIENCED ILIESCU FOR LEADERSHIP, AND HE </p><p>QUICKLY BECAME THE DOMINANT FIGURE IN THE AD HOC </p><p>NATIONAL SALVATION FRONT (NSF) GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. GIVEN THE TOTAL LACK OF ORGANIZED OPPOSITION </p><p>GROUPS IN ROMANIA PRIOR TO THE REVOLUTION, ILIESCU </p><p>HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO KEEP THE OLD BUREAUCRACY IN </p><p>OFFICE, BUT THIS DECISION ALIENATED THE </p><p>INTELLECTUALS AND THE EMERGING OPPOSITION PARTIES. </p><p>ILIESCU AND THE NSF MOVED QUICKLY TO LAY THE </p><p>FOUNDATIONS FOR A PLURALISTIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND </p><p>HE WON THE PRESIDENCY HANDILY IN THE MAY, 1990 </p><p>ELECTIONS -- WHICH, ALTHOUGH SERIOUSLY FLAWED, </p><p>REFLECTED THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE -- BUT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTIES REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE LEGITIMACY </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT AND CLAIMED THAT ILIESCU WAS A </p><p>"CRYPTO-COMMUNIST."  ILIESCU COMPOUNDED HIS PROBLEMS </p><p>BY SUMMONING MINERS TO BUCHAREST IN JUNE, 1990, TO </p><p>END THE OCCUPATION OF A MAJOR SQUARE BY PROTESTING </p><p>STUDENTS.  IN SEPTEMBER, 1991, THE MINERS AGAIN CAME </p><p>TO BUCHAREST AND FORCED THE RESIGNATION OF PRIME </p><p>MINISTER PETRE ROMAN, WITH WHOM ILIESCU HAD EARLIER </p><p>SPLIT DUE TO A DISPUTE ON THE PACE OF REFORM AS WELL </p><p>AS S CLASH OF AMBITIONS.  HOWEVER, ILIESCU THEN </p><p>APPOINTED A RESPECTED TECHNOCRAT AS PRIME MINISTER, </p><p>WHO, WITH ILIESCU\'S BACKING, ORGANIZED THE FREE AND </p><p>FAIR ELECTION OF SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 1992.  ILIESCU </p><p>AGAIN WON THE PRESIDENCY BY A WIDE MARGIN, HAVING </p><p>CAMPAIGNED ON A PLATFORM OF GRADUAL REFORM AND A </p><p>STRONG SOCIAL SAFETY NET TO EASE THE PAIN OF THE </p><p>TRANSITION TO THE MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>4. GIVEN ILIESCU\'S POLITICAL HISTORY AND OUR CLOSE </p><p>OBSERVATION OF HIM OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, WE HAVE </p><p>NO DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING THAT HE IS COMMITTED TO </p><p>THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH HE PLAYED A </p><p>LARGE PART IN ESTABLISHING.  HOWEVER, ILIESCU IS </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF RAPID MOVEMENT TOWARD </p><p>PRIVATIZATION ON ROMANIA\'S WORKERS -- NOT </p><p>SURPRISINGLY, IN VIEW OF HIS BACKGROUND.  HE TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR MOSES RECENTLY THAT THE 1990 STUDENT </p><p>PROTESTORS IN BUCHAREST WERE REALLY PAWNS OF THE </p><p>REESTABLISHED HISTORIC PARTIES, WHICH WERE USING </p><p>THEM IN AN EFFORT TO RESTORE THE PRE-WWII SOCIAL </p><p>ORDER WITH ITS ENORMOUS DISPARITIES OF WEALTH. </p><p>WHETHER THERE IS ANY TRUTH TO THIS INTERPRETATION OR </p><p>NOT, IT IS INDICATIVE OF ILIESCU\'S VIEWS.  ON </p><p>ECONOMIC MATTERS, HE IS PRO-REFORM BUT WANTS TO </p><p>PROTECT THE WORKERS.  THIS IS BOTH IDEOLOGICAL AND </p><p>REFLECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT HIS POLITICAL BASE AND </p><p>THAT OF HIS PARTY (PDSR) LIES WITH THE ROMANIAN </p><p>WORKERS EMPLOYED FOR THE LAST FOUR DECADES BY STATE- </p><p>OWNED BUSINESSES.  AS HE PUT IT IN THE 1992 </p><p>CAMPAIGN, HIS GOAL IS A "SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY" -- </p><p>AN ECONOMY WITH PRIVATE PROPERTY AND FREE </p><p>ENTERPRISE, BUT ONE IN WHICH STATE REGULATION IS </p><p>USED TO PREVENT THE EXTREME INEQUALITIES AND MASSIVE </p><p>POVERTY WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE PRE-WAR ORDER. </p><p>SINCE 1992, ILIESCU HAS GIVEN MORE SUPPORT TO </p><p>REFORMS, INCLUDING AUSTERITY MEASURES, THAN SUCH </p><p>CAMPAIGN RHETORIC WOULD HAVE LED ONE TO EXPECT </p><p>(SEPTEL), BUT IN OUR VIEW HE WILL NEVER BE PREPARED </p><p>TO GO FURTHER TOWARD AN UNREGULATED MARKET THAN A </p><p>TRADITIONAL EUROPEAN SOCIAL DEMOCRAT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>5. FROM COMMUNIST ORTHODOXY TO DISSIDENCE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>ILIESCU CAME FROM A WORKING CLASS COMMUNIST </p><p>BACKGROUND AND ROSE RAPIDLY THROUGH THE PARTY RANKS </p><p>UNTIL HIS 1971 BREAK WITH CEAUSESCU.  ILIESCU\'S </p><p>FATHER, A RAILWAY WORKER, WAS ONE OF THE FEW ETHNIC </p><p>ROMANIAN ACTIVISTS IN THE TINY PRE-WWII ROMANIAN </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY (RCP).  ILIESCU HIMSELF JOINED THE </p><p>COMMUNIST YOUTH ORGANIZATION IN 1944 AT THE AGE OF </p><p>14 AND, AFTER OBTAINING HYDROENGINEERING DEGREES </p><p>FROM THE BUCHAREST POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND THE </p><p>MOSCOW ENERGY INSTITUTE, HELD POSITIONS ON THE YOUTH </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  IN 1965 HE BECAME </p><p>AN ALTERNATE MEMBER OF THE RCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND </p><p>IN 1967 HE WAS MADE A FULL MEMBER, AS WELL AS BEING </p><p>APPOINTED MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS.  IN 1969 HE WAS </p><p>NAMED AN ALTERNATE MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S </p><p>POWERFUL POLITICAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE (POLITBURO). </p><p> </p><p>6. DESPITE HIS ORTHODOX COMMUNIST BACKGROUND AND </p><p>RAPID RISE IN THE PARTY HIERARCHY, ILIESCU BEGAN TO </p><p>CRITICIZE CEAUSESCU\'S GROWING CULT OF PERSONALITY, </p><p>NEPOTISM, AND EXTREME ECONOMIC CENTRALIZATION </p><p>POLICIES.  AS A RESULT, AND PROBABLY ALSO BECAUSE HE </p><p>WAS VIEWED IN SOME QUARTERS AS A POSSIBLE EVENTUAL </p><p>SUCCESSOR TO CEAUSESCU, HE WAS DISMISSED FROM THE </p><p>YOUTH MINISTRY IN 1971 AND DEMOTED TO THE POSITION </p><p>OF SECRETARY OF THE TIMIS COUNTY RCP.  IN 1974, </p><p>ILIESCU OBTAINED THE MORE IMPORTANT POSITION OF </p><p>FIRST SECRETARY OF THE IASI COUNTY RCP, BUT HIS </p><p>OUTSPOKENNESS AND LOCAL POPULARITY AGAIN LED TO </p><p>DEMOTION IN 1978, THIS TIME TO THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF </p><p>THE WATER RESOURCES COUNCIL.  HE ALSO LOST HIS </p><p>POLITICAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE POSITION THAT YEAR. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, ILIESCU CONTINUED TO TAKE A CRITICAL </p><p>STANCE TOWARD THE CEAUSESCU REGIME, AND IN 1984 HE </p><p>LOST BOTH HIS RCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE SEAT AND EVEN </p><p>HIS WATER RESOURCES COUNCIL POSITION.  FROM 1984 TO </p><p>THE DECEMBER 1989 REVOLUTION, ILIESCU SERVED IN </p><p>OBSCURITY AS THE DIRECTOR OF A TECHNICAL PUBLISHING </p><p>HOUSE, BUT DURING THIS PERIOD HE BEGAN ADVOCATING AN </p><p>OPENING OF ROMANIAN SOCIETY ALONG THE LINES BEING </p><p>PURSUED BY GORBACHEV IN THE THEN USSR. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>7. ILIESCU STEPS INTO THE POST-REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>   LEADERSHIP VACUUM </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>DESPITE HIS YEARS IN THE POLITICAL WILDERNESS, </p><p>ILIESCU WAS WELL-KNOWN AND POPULAR AMONG POLITICALLY </p><p>ATTUNED ROMANIANS ON THE EVE OF THE 1989 REVOLUTION. </p><p>SINCE THERE WERE NO DISSIDENT GROUPS IN ROMANIA </p><p>READY AND WAITING TO TAKE POWER FOLLOWING THE SUDDEN </p><p>FALL OF CEAUSESCU, THE ISSUE OF WHO WOULD NOW RUN </p><p>THE COUNTRY FELL BY DEFAULT INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE </p><p>CITIZENS OF BUCHAREST -- PRIMARILY INTELLECTUALS -- </p><p>WHO HAD GATHERED SPONTANEOUSLY AT VARIOUS SITES TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE CHAOTIC SITUATION CREATED BY THE </p><p>COLLAPSE OF THE DICTATORSHIP.  MANY OF THEM TURNED </p><p>TO THE POLITICALLY MORE EXPERIENCED ILIESCU FOR </p><p>LEADERSHIP BECAUSE HE HAD ANTI-CEAUSESCU CREDENTIALS </p><p>AND SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HOW ORDER COULD BE RESTORED </p><p>QUICKLY.  ILIESCU ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EMERGED AS THE </p><p>DOMINANT FIGURE IN THE AD HOC NATIONAL SALVATION </p><p>FRONT (NSF) GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. COMMENT: OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF THE 1989 </p><p>REVOLUTION HAVE IT THAT ILIESCU AND LIKE-MINDED </p><p>PARTY DISSIDENTS HAD EITHER BEEN PLOTTING A COUP AND </p><p>USED THE REVOLUTION AS A COVER TO STAGE IT, OR </p><p>STEPPED IN AND "STOLE" THE REVOLUTION AS IT WAS </p><p>OCCURRING.  WE FIND THE FIRST INTERPRETATION TOO </p><p>PARANOID TO BE ACCEPTABLE WITHOUT OVERWHELMING </p><p>PROOF.  AS FOR THE SECOND, SINCE THE REVOLUTION WAS </p><p>NOT LED BY AN ESTABLISHED ANTI-COMMUNIST GROUP SUCH </p><p>AS SOLIDARITY, BUT BROKE OUT SPONTANEOUSLY, WHO IS </p><p>ILIESCU SUPPOSED TO HAVE STOLEN IT FROM?  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>9. TWO BAD YEARS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>DUE TO THE LACK OF ORGANIZED ANTI-COMMUNIST </p><p>OPPOSITION FORCES PRIOR TO THE REVOLUTION, ILIESCU </p><p>HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO KEEP THE OLD POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC BUREAUCRACY IN OFFICE, EXCEPT AT THE VERY </p><p>HIGHEST LEVELS.  HOWEVER, GIVEN HIS OWN BACKGROUND, </p><p>HE PROBABLY FELT NO DESIRE TO PURGE THOSE OFFICIALS </p><p>WHO WERE READY AND ABLE TO ADJUST TO A NEW POLITICAL </p><p>SYSTEM.  (NOTE: A POINT OF VIEW MORE ACCEPTABLE NOW </p><p>THAT FORMER COMMUNISTS HOLD POWER THROUGHOUT MUCH OF </p><p>THE REGION.  END NOTE.)  MANY OF THE INTELLECTUALS </p><p>WHO HAD INITIALLY SUPPORTED ILIESCU TURNED AGAINST </p><p>HIM BECAUSE OF HIS FAILURE TO PURGE THE BUREAUCRACY </p><p>AND HIS LATER DECISION TO TURN THE NSF INTO A PARTY </p><p>-- ONE WHICH THE BUREAUCRATS HE HAD RETAINED IN </p><p>OFFICE NATURALLY SUPPORTED.  GIVEN ILIESCU\'S OWN </p><p>COMMUNIST PAST, IT WAS EASY FOR THE INTELLECTUALS </p><p>AND THE EMERGING OPPOSITION PARTIES TO DISPUTE THE </p><p>VERY LEGITIMACY OF THE PROVISIONAL NSF GOVERNMENT -- </p><p>A TACTIC WHOSE CONTINUED USE STILL EMBITTERS </p><p>ROMANIAN POLITICS TODAY. </p><p> </p><p>10. ILIESCU AND THE NSF QUICKLY MOVED TO ESTABLISH </p><p>CIVIL LIBERTIES AND A PLURALISTIC POLITICAL SYSTEM. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE MAY 1990 ELECTIONS, IN WHICH ILIESCU </p><p>WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT WITH 85& OF THE VOTE, WERE </p><p>SERIOUSLY FLAWED.  THE NSF HAD CONSIDERABLE </p><p>ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF CONTROL OF AND/OR ACCESS TO </p><p>THE MEDIA, FUNDS, AND OTHER RESOURCES BASIC TO AN </p><p>ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  WORSE, NSF SUPPORTERS </p><p>INTIMIDATED AND HARASSED OPPOSITION CANDIDATES IN </p><p>THE RURAL AREAS.  ALTHOUGH ILIESCU AND THE NSF WOULD </p><p>HAVE WON IN ANY CASE, THE NATURE OF THE CAMPAIGN </p><p>ALLOWED THE OPPOSITION TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OF </p><p>THE RESULTS, AND THEY CONTINUED TO ASSERT THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS ILLEGITIMATE AND ILIESCU A "CRYPTO- </p><p>COMMUNIST." </p><p> </p><p>11. ILIESCU THEN COMPOUNDED HIS PROBLEMS BY MAKING </p><p>THE WORST MISTAKE OF HIS POST-REVOLUTION CAREER -- </p><p>CALLING MINERS INTO BUCHAREST IN JUNE, 1990, TO </p><p>BREAK UP A MONTHS LONG OCCUPATION OF A CENTRAL </p><p>SQUARE BY STUDENT PROTESTORS.  (NOTE: ILIESCU HAS </p><p>CLAIMED, NOT VERY CONVINCINGLY, THAT HE DID NOT CALL </p><p>IN THE MINERS AND THAT THEIR ARRIVAL IN BUCHAREST </p><p>RESULTED FROM THEIR OWN PATRIOTIC INITIATIVE.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  THE MINERS NOT ONLY USED VIOLENCE AGAINST </p><p>THE STUDENTS, BUT ATTACKED THE OFFICES OF OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES AS WELL.  ILIESCU\'S IMAGE ABROAD SANK STILL </p><p>FURTHER WHEN HE SPLIT WITH HIS NSF PRIME MINISTER, </p><p>PETRE ROMAN, ON THE GROUND THAT ROMAN WAS MOVING TOO </p><p>QUICKLY ON ECONOMIC REFORM, BUT ALSO DUE TO CLASHING </p><p>AMBITIONS AND SHARPLY CONTRASTING PERSONAL STYLES. </p><p>AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF DISSENSION WITHIN THE NSF, </p><p>THE MINERS CAME TO BUCHAREST AGAIN IN SEPTEMBER OF </p><p>1991 TO DEMAND ROMAN\'S OUSTER.  THIS TIME, HOWEVER, </p><p>IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY HAD BEEN SUMMONED OR </p><p>HAD COME OF THEIR OWN VOLITION DUE TO A DROP IN </p><p>THEIR REAL INCOME WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTED TO ROMAN\'S </p><p>POLICIES.  WHATEVER THEIR ORIGINAL PURPOSE, ON </p><p>ARRIVAL IN THE CAPITAL SOME OF THE MINERS BEGAN </p><p>CALLING FOR ILIESCU\'S DEPARTURE AS WELL AS ROMAN\'S, </p><p>AND MARCHED ON HIS OFFICE AT COTROCENI PALACE. </p><p>ILIESCU RESPONDED BY OBTAINING ROMAN\'S RESIGNATION, </p><p>WHICH DEFUSED THE SITUATION AND ENABLED HIM TO GET </p><p>THE MINERS TO LEAVE BUCHAREST PEACEFULLY.  SHORTLY </p><p>THEREAFTER THE NSF BROKE UP, AND ROMAN AND THE YOUNG </p><p>TECHNOCRATS WHO SUPPORTED HIM FORMED THEIR OWN PARTY </p><p>WHILE THE BUREAUCRATS REMAINED WITH ILIESCU. </p><p> </p><p>12. COMMENT: ILIESCU HAS TOLD US THAT THE STUDENTS </p><p>PROTESTS OF SPRING 1990 WERE INSPIRED BY THE NEWLY </p><p>REESTABLISHED HISTORICAL PARTIES -- THE NATIONAL </p><p>PEASANT PARTY (PNTCD) AND THE NATIONAL LIBERAL PARTY </p><p>(PNL).  THESE PARTIES, HE ARGUED, WERE ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>USE THE STUDENTS TO "STEAL" THE 1989 REVOLUTION FOR </p><p>THEIR OWN PURPOSES: REVERSAL OF THE TREND TOWARD </p><p>EGALITARIANISM WHICH CAME WITH POST-WWII COMMUNIST </p><p>RULE AND THE RESTORATION OF THE PRE-WWII SOCIAL </p><p>ORDER, AN ORDER MARKED IN ILIESCU\'S VIEW (AND IN </p><p>FACT) BY ENORMOUS DISPARITIES OF WEALTH AND MASSIVE </p><p>POVERTY.  ALTHOUGH MORE PRO-REFORM THAN MANY OTHER </p><p>OFFICIALS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING PM </p><p>VACAROIU, ILIESCU FAVORS A PARTIAL GRATIS </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF OWNERSHIP IN PRIVATIZED ENTERPRISES </p><p>TO THE ROMANIAN PEOPLE, AS EVIDENCED BY THE RECENTLY </p><p>ENACTED MASS PRIVATIZATION LAW WHICH PROVIDES THAT </p><p>ALL CITIZENS WILL RECEIVE OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATES OF </p><p>EQUAL VALUE TO EXCHANGE FOR STOCK IN THE ENTERPRISES </p><p>TO BE TO BE PRIVATIZED.  ILIESCU IS ALSO ANXIOUS TO </p><p>AVERT, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE MASSIVE </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH COULD FOLLOW FROM PRIVATIZATION </p><p>AND ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING.  IT IS ILIESCU\'S OWN </p><p>LABOR CONSTITUENCY -- WHICH ENJOYED JOB SECURITY, IF </p><p>LITTLE ELSE, DURING THE COMMUNIST REGIME -- WHICH </p><p>WOULD BE MOST NEGATIVELY EFFECTED, AND HE IS </p><p>NATURALLY RELUCTANT TO RISK ALIENATING IT BY TAKING </p><p>THE LEAD IN FORCING RADICAL RESTRUCTURING.  ILIESCU </p><p>MAY HAVE ANTICIPATED THAT THE HISTORICAL PARTIES -- </p><p>WHOSE CONSTITUENCIES HAVE THE MOST TO GAIN FROM </p><p>PRIVATIZATION -- WOULD TAKE THE LEAD IN PERSUADING </p><p>ROMANIANS TO ACCEPT THE TEMPORARY PAIN WHICH </p><p>RESTRUCTURING ENTAILS; BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE </p><p>NOT EVEN SUPPORTED THE GOR\'S OWN MOVES IN THE </p><p>DIRECTION OF REFORM, PREFERRING TO CRITICIZE THEM </p><p>FOR THE SAKE OF POLITICAL ADVANTAGE.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>ILIESCU HIMSELF IS UNWILLING TO PUSH FOR RAPID </p><p>RESTRUCTURING IF THE PRICE IS UNEMPLOYMENT FOR THE </p><p>MANY AND MASSIVE AGGREGATIONS OF WEALTH FOR A FEW. </p><p> </p><p>13.  COMMENT CONTINUED: AS ILIESCU PUT IT DURING THE </p><p>1992 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN -- AND HE HAS NOT </p><p>DEVIATED SINCE -- HIS GOAL IS "A SOCIAL MARKET </p><p>ECONOMY," NOT "SAVAGE CAPITALISM."  IN OTHER WORDS, </p><p>PRIVATE PROPERTY AND FREE ENTERPRISE ARE FINE SO </p><p>LONG AS STATE REGULATION PREVENTS THE CREATION OF </p><p>ENORMOUS INCOME AND CLASS DISPARITIES.  THUS, WHILE </p><p>ILIESCU FULLY SUPPORTED THE POST-REVOLUTION SALE OF </p><p>STATE-OWNED APARTMENTS TO THEIR TENANTS AT BARGAIN </p><p>PRICES -- A MOVE WHICH CREATED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS </p><p>OF HOME OWNERS AT A STROKE -- HE HAS JUST AS </p><p>VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED THE PHYSICAL RETURN OF </p><p>NATIONALIZED DWELLINGS TO THEIR FORMER OWNERS, WHOM </p><p>HE PROBABLY CONSIDERS, BUT HAS NOT PUBLICLY </p><p>DESCRIBED, AS PRE-WAR "ARISTOCRATS".  ILIESCU\'S </p><p>VETOES OF ATTEMPTS BY EX-KING MICHAEL TO TRAVEL TO </p><p>ROMANIA UNTIL HE FORMALLY RENOUNCES THE THRONE AND </p><p>PLEDGES NOT TO USE A VISIT TO INCITE PRO-MONARCHIST </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE ALSO NO DOUBT BEEN INSPIRED IN </p><p>LARGE MEASURE BY HIS AVERSION TO THE POLITICAL AND </p><p>SOCIAL ORDER OF PRE-WAR ROMANIA.  IN ANY CASE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR </p><p>RESTORING THE MONARCHY (NO MORE THAN 20& HAVE EVER </p><p>FAVORED IT, ACCORDING TO PUBLIC OPINION POLLS) AND </p><p>EVEN THE PNTCD IS NOW DOWNPLAYING ITS TRADITIONAL </p><p>MONARCHISM.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>14. THE TURN OF THE TIDE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING THE FALL OF THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT, ILIESCU </p><p>IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF STEPS </p><p>WHICH REESTABLISHED HIS CREDENTIALS AS A POLITICAL </p><p>DEMOCRAT AND AN ADVOCATE, HOWEVER CAUTIOUS, OF </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM. HE APPOINTED TEODOR STOLOJAN, A </p><p>WELL-RESPECTED ECONOMIST WITHOUT PARTY AFFILIATION, </p><p>AS PRIME MINISTER.  STOLOJAN, WITH ILIESCU\'S </p><p>SUPPORT, DEFINED HIS PRIMARY TASK AS ORGANIZING FREE </p><p>AND FAIR LOCAL AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS WITHIN A YEAR, </p><p>AFTER WHICH HE WOULD RESIGN.  DURING THE RUN-UP TO </p><p>THE FALL 1992 ELECTIONS, ILIESCU AND HIS PARTY -- </p><p>SHORTLY TO BE RENAMED THE PARTY OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY </p><p>(PDSR) -- CAMPAIGNED ON A PLATFORM OF GRADUAL </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM AND A STRONG SOCIAL SAFETY NET TO </p><p>MINIMIZE THE PAIN OF THE TRANSITION TO THE MARKET. </p><p>THE PDSR WON 27& OF THE VOTE IN THE ELECTIONS -- </p><p>WHICH ALL INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS CONSIDERED FAIR </p><p>AND FREE --  WHICH GAVE IT A PLURALITY.  ILIESCU DID </p><p>FAR BETTER THAN HIS PARTY.  RUNNING AGAINST FIVE </p><p>OTHER CANDIDATES, HE WON 47& OF THE VOTE IN THE </p><p>FIRST ROUND OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  IN THE </p><p>SECOND ROUND, RUNNING ONLY AGAINST THE STRONGEST </p><p>OPPOSITION CANDIDATE, ILIESCU TOOK 61& OF THE VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>15. COMMENT: MOST ANALYSTS HERE ATTRIBUTE ILIESCU\'S </p><p>1992 VICTORY TO HIS COMBINATION OF DIGNITY, WHICH </p><p>ROMANIANS EXPECT OF A PRESIDENT, AND A "COMMON MAN" </p><p>APPROACH -- ONE OF ILIESCU\'S MOST EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN </p><p>SLOGANS WAS "FROM US, FOR US."  IN OUR VIEW, ILIESCU </p><p>DOES CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE, IF NOT A COMMON MAN, </p><p>THEN AT LEAST THE COMMON MAN\'S DEFENDER.  THIS </p><p>ATTITUDE IS A NATURAL OUTGROWTH OF HIS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>EGALITARIANISM AND HATRED OF THE PRE-WAR SOCIAL </p><p>ORDER, AND HAS BEEN REFLECTED NOT ONLY IN HIS </p><p>POSITION ON SUCH ISSUES AS NATIONALIZED HOUSING, BUT </p><p>IN HIS REPEATED -- BUT UNHEEDED -- DEMANDS THAT THE </p><p>MP\'S OF HIS OWN PARTY EITHER RESIGN FROM LUCRATIVE </p><p>ECONOMIC POSITIONS ON THE BOARDS OF STATE </p><p>ENTERPRISES OR LEAVE PARLIAMENT,  AS WELL AS IN HIS </p><p>DENUNCIATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN GENERAL.  IT IS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT THAT ILIESCU IS ONE OF THE FEW POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS HERE WHO HAS NOT BEEN SUBJECTED TO CONSTANT </p><p>-- AND IN MANY CASES, WELL-GROUNDED -- ACCUSATIONS </p><p>OF CORRUPTION.  IN FACT, SOME OPPOSITION LEADERS </p><p>CRITICIZED ILIESCU\'S STATED DESIRE TO "DIE A POOR </p><p>MAN" NOT ON GROUNDS OF HYPOCRISY, BUT OF </p><p>"STUPIDITY." </p><p> </p><p>16. COMMENT CONTINUED: HOWEVER, ILIESCU IS NOW </p><p>CAUGHT IN A POLITICAL VICE BETWEEN HIS PRO-REFORM, </p><p>PRO-WESTERN POLICIES AND HIS POLITICAL BASE, WHICH </p><p>IS FIRMLY GROUNDED IN A CONSTITUENCY THAT FEARS </p><p>RAPID CHANGE, BEING THE LEAST ABLE TO COPE WITH A </p><p>FREE MARKET AND FULL LABOR MOBILITY.  CONTROLLING </p><p>INFLATION AND RAISING REAL WAGES, EVEN MINIMALLY, </p><p>HAVE HELPED, BUT IN THE LONG-RUN HIS PRO-REFORM </p><p>POLICIES WILL UNDERMINE HIM AND HIS PARTY IN </p><p>ROMANIA.  ILIESCU WILL CONTINUE TO BE PORTRAYED BY </p><p>THE OPPOSITION AS A CRYPTO-COMMUNIST MASQUERADING IN </p><p>WESTERN GARB.  BUT WHILE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE </p><p>HISTORIC PARTIES (PEASANT AND LIBERAL) TALK REFORM, </p><p>THEY VOTED AGAINST THE IMF AGREEMENT AND THE MASS </p><p>PRIVATIZATION LAW TO DENY THE GOVERNMENT THE </p><p>LEGITIMACY THAT THEIR CONCURRENCE WOULD HAVE </p><p>BROUGHT.  ILIESCU IS ATTEMPTING TO SURVIVE ON THE </p><p>HORNS OF THIS DILEMMA BY PROTECTING THE WORKER AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME THAT ROMANIA PRIVATIZES, PRIMARILY BY </p><p>MEANS OF MANAGEMENT-EMPLOYEE BUY-OUTS (MEBO\'S), </p><p>WHICH CONTINUE TO BE PERMITTED UNDER THE MASS </p><p>PRIVATIZATION LAW, COMBINED WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATES TO THE PUBLIC.  THIS POLICY </p><p>MAY HAVE SHORT-TERM POLITICAL BENEFITS BUT LONG-TERM </p><p>NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR A COUNTRY THAT WILL SOON </p><p>HAVE MORE THAN 3000 FORMER STATE-OWNED BUSINESSES </p><p>OWNED AND OPERATED BY MANAGEMENT -- AND/OR MILLIONS </p><p>OF NEW SMALL SHAREHOLDERS -- AND PRESENT EMPLOYEES, </p><p>WITH CONFLICTING SHORT AND LONG-TERM INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>17. COMMENT CONTINUED: ILIESCU\'S "COMMON MAN" </p><p>ORIENTATION IS ALSO REFLECTED IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. </p><p>HE AND HIS WIFE ELENA, WHO HAS AN ENGINEERING </p><p>DEGREE, ARE CHILDLESS AND LIVE MODESTLY IN AN </p><p>APARTMENT BUILDING WHICH CONTAINS FOUR OTHER UNITS. </p><p>THEY NEVER APPEAR ON THE BUCHAREST NIGHT LIFE </p><p>CIRCUIT AND ELENA IS VERY RARELY SEEN IN PUBLIC AT </p><p>ALL, NOR DOES SHE ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND ON HIS </p><p>OFFICIAL TRIPS ABROAD.  ILIESCU HAS LEARNED TO SPEAK </p><p>ENGLISH QUITE WELL SINCE THE 1989 REVOLUTION, AND </p><p>ALSO SPEAKS RUSSIAN, FRENCH, AND SOME SPANISH. </p><p>ELENA ILIESCU DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH.  HOWEVER, SHE </p><p>IS REPORTED TO HAVE INTELLECTUAL INTERESTS AND TO BE </p><p>A READER OF AMERICAN FICTION.  ILIESCU, WHO </p><p>RECOVERED RAPIDLY FROM GALL BLADDER SURGERY LAST </p><p>SUMMER, APPEARS TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH.  HIS WIFE, </p><p>HOWEVER, REPORTEDLY HAS A SERIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEM -- </p><p>PERHAPS CANCER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EINIK </p><p></p></div>
