(U)  SUMMARY.  NONG DUC MANH, GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV), VISITED RUSSIA OCTOBER 9- </p><p>13 AND BELARUS OCTOBER 13-15.  ALL SIDES HAVE DESCRIBED THE </p><p>CAREFULLY SCRIPTED VISITS AS "SUCCESSFUL."  MANH\'S FOCUS WAS </p><p>ON IMPROVING TRADE AND REAFFIRMING HIS "STRONG PERSONAL </p><p>RELATIONS."  RUSSIA DOES NOT APPEAR ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A </p><p>FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM; BELARUS DOES, HOWEVER. </p><p>OTHER TOPICS RAISED INCLUDED CAM RANH BAY (AT LEAST </p><p>INFORMALLY); INCREASING COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE; THE OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY; </p><p>AND TERRORISM.  A SEPARATE GVN MILITARY DELEGATION </p><p>DISCUSSED SEARCH-AND-RESCUE COOPERATION WITH RUSSIAN </p><p>COUNTERPARTS, WHILE ANOTHER MILITARY DELEGATION VISITED </p><p>BELARUS JUST AFTER MANH DEPARTED.  REFTEL REPORTED ON MANH\'S </p><p>VISIT TO JAPAN, WHICH TOOK PLACE JUST PRIOR TO HIS VISITS TO </p><p>RUSSIA AND BELARUS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THIS WAS MANH\'S FIRST VISIT TO RUSSIA AND BELARUS </p><p>SINCE BECOMING GENERAL SECRETARY IN APRIL 2001, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>HAD BEEN TO BOTH PREVIOUSLY AS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN. </p><p>HIS HOSTS, PRESIDENTS PUTIN AND LUKASHENKO, HAD EACH VISITED </p><p>VIETNAM WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN </p><p>KHAI VISITED THE TWO COUNTRIES IN SEPTEMBER 2000.

(U)  IN RUSSIA, MANH SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN MOSCOW, </p><p>WHERE HE MET WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN, PRIME MINISTER KASYANOV, </p><p>THE SPEAKER OF THE DUMA, MOSCOW\'S MAYOR, AND SEVERAL LEADERS </p><p>OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF RUSSIA, ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS.  MANH ALSO VISITED ST. PETERSBURG\'S ACADEMY OF </p><p>FORESTRY, WHERE HE HAD STUDIED IN THE LATE 1960S AND WHERE </p><p>HE ON THIS VISIT HAD "INFORMAL AND FRIENDLY" EXCHANGES WITH </p><p>FACULTY AND STUDENTS, ACCORDING TO VLADIMIR TOKMAKOV, </p><p>RUSSIAN EMBASSY FIRST SECRETARY.  IN BELARUS, MANH MET WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, UPPER CHAMBER SPEAKER </p><p>ALEXANDER VOITOVICH, LOWER HOUSE SPEAKER VADIM POPOV, AND </p><p>FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SERGEY SIDORSKY, ACCORDING TO </p><p>INFORMATION PROVIDED BY BELARUS EMBASSY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES </p><p>ALEKSANDER PARKHUTA. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>TRADE - IMPROVING </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  BILATERAL TRADE WITH RUSSIAN IS REPORTEDLY </p><p>EXPECTED TO INCREASE ALMOST 40 PERCENT FROM 2001 TO 2002 - </p><p>TO ALMOST USD 700 MILLION - BUT THIS REMAINS "MODEST" </p><p>COMPARED TO BILATERAL TRADE BETWEEN VIETNAM AND THE U.S. AND </p><p>VIETNAM AND THE PRC, ACCORDING TO VARIOUS SOURCES.  (TRADE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02622  01 OF 04  301009Z </p><p>WITH THE U.S. IS EXPECTED TO REACH ABOUT USD 1.7 BILLION </p><p>THIS YEAR WHILE TRADE WITH THE PRC WILL PROBABLY EXCEED USD </p><p>3 BILLION.)  TWO-WAY TRADE CURRENTLY FAVORS RUSSIA - ITS </p><p>EXPORTS TO VIETNAM ARE ABOUT DOUBLE ITS IMPORTS, ACCORDING </p><p>TO PRESS REPORTS AND THE VIETNAM TRADE PROMOTION AGENCY. </p><p>WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS, THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY\'S TOKMAKOV </p><p>SAID THAT PROSPECTS ARE "EXCELLENT" FOR TWO-WAY TRADE TO </p><p>REACH USD ONE BILLION "OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS."  TOKMAKOV </p><p>OPINED THAT ONE REASON FOR THE MOST RECENT JUMP WAS THE </p><p>VISIT OF PRESIDENT PUTIN TO VIETNAM IN MARCH 2001, AND THE </p><p>"MANY ADDITIONAL BUSINESS CONTACTS" THAT THIS VISIT HAD </p><p>FACILITATED.  ADDITIONALLY, VIETNAM IS BEGINNING TO INVEST </p><p>IN JOINT VENTURES IN RUSSIA, ESPECIALLY IN THE FOODSTUFFS </p><p>AND GARMENT INDUSTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  MANH\'S DELEGATION RAISED THE IDEA OF A FREE TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA.  TOKMAKOV AND, SEPARATELY, DR. BUI </p><p>HUY KHOAT, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF EUROPEAN STUDIES OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES, </p><p>NOTED THAT THIS HAD BEEN ON THE GVN\'S AGENDA PREVIOUSLY, BUT </p><p>THE RUSSIANS CONTINUE TO BE "UNENTHUSIASTIC" ABOUT IT, </p><p>ACCORDING TO KHOAT.  TOKMAKOV SAID THAT THE RUSSIAN SIDE HAD </p><p>REQUESTED ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS FROM THE VIETNAMESE AS </p><p>TO JUST WHAT THEY MEAN BY A "FREE TRADE AGREEMENT."  DR. </p><p>KHOAT OPINED IT WOULD "PROBABLY" BE DISCUSSED AT THE NEXT </p><p>SEMI-ANNUAL MEETING OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION, BUT </p><p>NOTED THAT RUSSIA IS "MOST LIKELY MORE INTERESTED IN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ7919 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02622  02 OF 04  301010Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   A-00     CA-01    CCO-00 </p><p>      CEA-01   CG-00    CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DOEE-00 </p><p>      ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      OIGO-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00  ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    NRCE-00  NSAE-00  OCS-03   OES-01 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      USSS-00  SA-00    R-00     EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /014W </p><p>                  ------------------00837C  301012Z /38 </p><p>R 300936Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7963 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MINSK </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ACHAO// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 HANOI 002622 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EUR/RUS, EUR/UMB </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02622  02 OF 04  301010Z </p><p> </p><p>ACCESSION TO THE WTO" THAN NEGOTIATING A SEPARATE TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM.  (NOTE:  WHAT VIETNAM IS MOSTLY </p><p>LIKELY SEEKING IS LOWER TARIFFS ON VIETNAMESE GOODS EXPORTED </p><p>TO RUSSIA. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  TRADE WITH BELARUS IS "VERY MODEST," ADMITTED </p><p>NGUYEN MANH HUNG, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CPV CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S COMMISSION FOR EXTERNAL RELATIONS.  DURING THE </p><p>FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2002, TRADE TURNOVER REACHED JUST USD 15 </p><p>MILLION.  (THIS APPEARS TO REPRESENT A DECLINE FROM 2001, </p><p>WHEN BILATERAL TRADE REACHED ABOUT USD 41 MILLION, ACCORDING </p><p>TO ONE PRESS REPORT.)  VIETNAM IMPORTS TRUCKS, TRACTORS, </p><p>MOTORBIKES, FERTILIZERS, AND ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT AND </p><p>EXPORTS RICE, GROUND NUTS, COFFEE, PROCESSED FRUIT AND </p><p>VEGETABLES, TEXTILES, AND FOOTWEAR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  HUNG (WHO ACCOMPANIED MANH ON THE TRIP) EXPRESSED </p><p>OPTIMISM THAT MANH\'S VISIT WILL "HELP BOTH SIDES REACH THEIR </p><p>TRADE POTENTIAL."  HE POINTED TO A "PRELIMINARY" AGREEMENT </p><p>FOR VIETNAM TO ASSEMBLE BELARUS TRACTORS (CONTINGENT UPON A </p><p>FEASIBILITY STUDY) AS WELL AS A JOINT VENTURE TO ASSEMBLE </p><p>MINSK MOTORBIKES, WHICH ARE POPULAR IN VIETNAM\'S MOUNTAINOUS </p><p>REGIONS.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, BELARUS HAS THUS FAR </p><p>ONLY INVESTED IN TWO JOINT VENTURES - BOTH IN QUANG NINH </p><p>PROVINCE IN NORTHEASTERN VIETNAM: ONE TO REFURBISH USED </p><p>TRUCKS AND ANOTHER TO PRODUCE CONDOMS.  HUNG DID NOT EXPLAIN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02622  02 OF 04  301010Z </p><p>WHY BILATERAL TRADE WILL APPARENTLY DECLINE THIS YEAR, BUT </p><p>NOTED THAT, "ON THE POSITIVE SIDE," BELARUS LEADERS HAVE </p><p>INDICATED INTEREST IN A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM. </p><p>WHILE HE EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT SUCH AN AGREEMENT WOULD </p><p>EXPAND TWO-WAY TRADE "SIGNIFICANTLY," HE DECLINED TO PREDICT </p><p>WHEN IT MIGHT BE CONCLUDED OR PROVIDE DETAILS AS TO WHAT </p><p>SUCH AN AGREEMENT MIGHT ENTAIL. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>CAM RANH BAY - NO CHANGE IN STATUS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  DR. KHOAT AND TOKMAKOV CONFIRMED SEPARATELY THAT </p><p>CAM RANH BAY WAS NOT OFFICIALLY ON THE AGENDA.  HOWEVER, </p><p>ACCORDING TO A RUSSIAN PRESS REPORT, MANH AND PUTIN BRIEFLY </p><p>DISCUSSED THE FUTURE OF THE BASE AND MANH PROMISED IT WOULD </p><p>"NOT BE GIVEN AWAY TO ANY STATE."  THE CPV\'S HUNG SAID THAT </p><p>HE "DID NOT RECALL" THE TWO LEADERS DISCUSSING CAM RANH BAY, </p><p>BUT SAID THAT THE CITED PRESS REPORT WAS CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>VIETNAM\'S POSITION, WHICH IS "WELL-KNOWN TO RUSSIA AND OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES." (NOTE:  THE GVN HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT WOULD </p><p>NOT LEASE CAM RANH BAY AGAIN TO ANY SINGLE FOREIGN MILITARY. </p><p>END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>COOPERATION </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  HUNG SAID THAT THE VISITS HAD PROVIDED A FORUM TO </p><p>DISCUSS COOPERATION IN OTHER AREAS, SPECIFICALLY SCIENCE AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES, AS WELL AS VIETNAM\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02622  02 OF 04  301010Z </p><p>DESIRE TO SEE RUSSIA EXPAND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR </p><p>VIETNAMESE STUDENTS.  HUNG CITED A "VERY POSITIVE" MEETING </p><p>BETWEEN GVN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (AND FORMER TRADE </p><p>MINISTER) VU KHOAN AND RUSSIA\'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>KRISTENKO, DURING WHICH THEY DISCUSSED A "GENERAL FRAMEWORK" </p><p>FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION.  HUNG SAID </p><p>THAT THIS WOULD BE REVIEWED IN MORE DETAIL AT THE NEXT INTER- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION MEETING, SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN </p><p>DECEMBER.  IN ADDITION, HUNG NOTED THAT THE LEADERS </p><p>DISCUSSED THEIR DESIRE FOR "FURTHER CULTURAL TIES" BETWEEN </p><p>CITIES IN RUSSIA AND VIETNAM.  REGARDING TRAINING, HUNG SAID </p><p>THAT VIETNAMESE CONTINUE TO REGARD RUSSIA AS A "DESIRABLE </p><p>LOCATION" FOR ADVANCED STUDIES AND TRAINING.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>UNABLE TO CITE SPECIFIC FIGURES, HUNG SAID THE NUMBERS OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE STUDYING IN RUSSIA IS "INCREASING STEADILY;" </p><p>MANH THANKED PUTIN FOR RUSSIA\'S CONTINUED SUPPORT IN THIS </p><p>SECTOR. (NOTE: IN THE HEYDAY OF EDUCATIONAL "EXCHANGES", THE </p><p>FORMER SOVIET UNION AND OTHER EASTERN BLOC NATIONS SPONSORED </p><p>UP TO 20,000 VIETNAMESE STUDENTS A YEAR ON "FULL" </p><p>SCHOLARSHIPS.  MOST VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS OVER 45 YEARS OLD </p><p>HOLD DEGREES FROM MOSCOW, SOFIA, BUDAPEST, BERLIN, AND </p><p>WARSAW ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS.  WITH THE CHANGE IN POLITICAL </p><p>SYSTEMS AND POLITICAL PRIORITIES IN THOSE FORMER COMMUNIST </p><p>COMRADE COUNTRIES, SCHOLARSHIPS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY AND IN </p><p>SOME CASES, DISAPPEARED.  MOST VIETNAMESE THESE DAYS WOULD </p><p>PREFER TO GO TO THE U.S., AUSTRALIA OR EUROPE TO STUDY.

TOKMAKOV SAID THERE </p><p>HAVE ALSO BEEN "UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS" OF RUSSIAN </p><p>"HOOLIGANS" ATTACKING VIETNAMESE IN MOSCOW.  THE CPV\'S HUNG </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THERE ARE "NO ILLEGAL VIETNAMESE" IN RUSSIA. </p><p>HE EXPLAINED THAT MANY VIETNAMESE HAD GONE TO RUSSIA DURING </p><p>THE SOVIET ERA ON CONTRACTS; SOME WERE THE VICTIMS OF THE </p><p>"RESULTING CHAOS" THAT ENSUED WHEN THE SOVIET UNION </p><p>COLLAPSED AND MANY FACTORIES CHANGED OWNERSHIP.  THUS, WHILE </p><p>THERE MAY BE "MISUNDERSTANDINGS" REGARDING THEIR STATUS, </p><p>VIETNAM DENIES ANY OF ITS CITIZENS ARE IN RUSSIA ILLEGALLY. </p><p>HUNG SAID THAT MANH HAD PRESSED PUTIN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY </p><p>OF ALL VIETNAMESE LIVING IN RUSSIA.  HUNG SAID THAT THERE </p><p>ARE SIMILAR QUESTIONS REGARDING VIETNAMESE LIVING IN </p><p>BELARUS, BUT THE NUMBERS ARE MUCH SMALLER. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02622  03 OF 04  301010Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>TERRORISM - WE CONDEMN IT, BUT STICK WITH THE UN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>11.

HOWEVER, HUNG NOTED THAT THE LEADERS </p><p>HAD ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT COUNTERTERRORISM ACTIVITIES SHOULD </p><p>BE CARRIED OUT WITHIN A MULTILATERAL FRAMEWORK AND "WITHOUT </p><p>INFRINGING ON THE SOVEREIGNTY OF INDIVIDUAL NATIONS."  AS </p><p>EXEMPLIFIED IN THE JOINT COMMUNIQU WITH BELARUS, BOTH SIDES </p><p>"PROTEST AGAINST THE ABUSE OF ANTI-TERRORISM TO INTERFERE </p><p>INTO OTHER NATIONS\' INTERNAL AFFAIRS." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS - A POSSIBLE FUTURE ISSUE? </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.

HE NOTED THAT "A FEW" DUMA </p><p>MEMBERS HAVE CRITICIZED VIETNAM OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS FOR </p><p>ITS RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY.  THE CPV\'S HUNG </p><p>CONFIRMED SEPARATELY THAT THIS ISSUE DID NOT COME DURING THE </p><p>VISIT.  HUNG STATED THAT SUCH A DISCUSSION WOULD BE </p><p>"UNNATURAL" SINCE RUSSIA AND VIETNAM HAVE NO DISAGREEMENT </p><p>OVER HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY.  HE OPINED THAT, IN ANY </p><p>LARGE LEGISLATIVE BODY, THERE ARE BOUND TO BE A "WIDE </p><p>VARIETY" OF OPINIONS.

HOWEVER, </p><p>TOKMAKOV SAID THAT, DURING THE VISIT, MANH REITERATED </p><p>VIETNAM\'S VIEW THAT MILITARY COOPERATION IS "IMPORTANT." </p><p>TOKMAKOV NOTED THAT, WHILE VIETNAM CANNOT "AFFORD MUCH," ITS </p><p>MILITARY STILL NEEDS BASIC EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS THAT </p><p>THE RUSSIANS CAN SUPPLY.  THE CPV\'S HUNG SAID SEPARATELY </p><p>THAT THE SUBJECT WAS "DISCUSSED ONLY VERY GENERALLY" DURING </p><p>BOTH VISITS.
