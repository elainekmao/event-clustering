<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 000527 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, DRL/PHD, INL/LP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KCRM, ASEC, SNAR, KJUS, PREL, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MADURO VOWS TO COMBAT RISING MINOR </p><p>HOMICIDE RATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 TEGUCIGALPA 2956 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Roger D. Pierce for reasons </p><p>1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On February 19, before a hastily convened </p><p>international audience which included the ambassadors of </p><p>Great Britain, Taiwan, Germany, France, Spain, as well as </p><p>PolOff, President Ricardo Maduro vowed to combat Honduras\' </p><p>surging homicide rate for minors.  Maduro expressed his </p><p>administration\'s deep concern about the issue, calling the </p><p>murder of children the "ultimate human rights violation," and </p><p>asserted that those perpetuating these crimes will be brought </p><p>to justice.  At the same time, however, Maduro acknowledged </p><p>the lack of law enforcement resources as a serious </p><p>impediment, specifically mentioning that every homicide </p><p>investigator is responsible for over 200 cases. The President </p><p>was accompanied by Defense Minister Frederico Breve and the </p><p>Minister of Public Security Oscar Alvarez. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Following Maduro\'s remarks Public Security Minister </p><p>Alvarez presented government statistics compiled by his </p><p>office outlining the scope of the problem.  Between 1998 and </p><p>2002, the GOH\'s figures count 744 minors murdered in </p><p>Honduras, primarily in the major urban centers of Tegucigalpa </p><p>and San Pedro Sula.  This figure is substantially higher than </p><p>the 574 cited by the Minister of Government and Justice in an </p><p>October 2002 report (reftel).  Casa Alianza (a child advocacy </p><p>NGO) has estimated that there were 1,500 extrajudicial </p><p>killings of youth under age 23 (including minors) between </p><p>January 1998 and December 2002.  Alarmingly, during 2002 </p><p>homicides of minors accounted for 42 percent of all cases. </p><p>Alvarez believes increased gang activity is to blame for the </p><p>killings.  This has become a particular concern since the </p><p>U.S. government has stepped up deportations of Honduran </p><p>nationals, many of whom were hardened gang members while in </p><p>the United States. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) During his remarks, Alvarez failed to address </p><p>accusations of extrajudicial killings by GOH security forces. </p><p> Alvarez only restated often-repeated GOH policy that </p><p>Honduras would not tolerate, condone, or  excuse the murder </p><p>of children.  In a government handout titled "Special Report </p><p>on Child Homicide," (distributed after the event) the issue </p><p>was broached, but then only to discount the possibility that </p><p>security forces have played any major role in child homicide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: The homicide closure rate in Honduras is </p><p>between 1-2 percent compared to a national U.S. closure rate </p><p>of close to 70 percent. While the GOH has adequately </p><p>identified the murder of minors as a serious issue, its </p><p>inability to dedicate more resources and technical ability to </p><p>address the problem underscores the GOH\'s lack of </p><p>follow-through on commitments made to the international </p><p>community last fall (reftel).  The failure to recognize the </p><p>role of security forces in these killings and/or to report on </p><p>the status of the over 20 cases where police are accused of </p><p>involvement, signals that the GOH is not seriously addressing </p><p>the possibility that its own security forces may be </p><p>implicated and if so, to what degree. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
