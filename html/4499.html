<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002700 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, PHUM, PGOV, ZI, Agriculture, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: ONLY 600 OF 4500 COMMERCIAL FARMERS STILL STANDING </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2561 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Given the chaotic nature of President Mugabe\'s </p><p>fast-track land reform, it is no easy task to quantify this </p><p>program.  Of 4,500 white-owned commercial farms, our best </p><p>guess is that 3,900 have closed down and 4,275 have been </p><p>slated for resettlement.  Despite GOZ claims that the land </p><p>resettlement process is complete, farmers continue to receive </p><p>new Section 8 acquisition notices, and others continue to </p><p>come under eviction pressure from "third party" forces (e.g., </p><p>war veteran, youth militia, or settler groups).  Observers </p><p>estimate that between 300,000 and 500,000 farm workers have </p><p>lost their homes and jobs, despite press statements from </p><p>Minister of Information Jonathan Moyo that "there are no </p><p>displaced farm workers in Zimbabwe" -- which statement </p><p>contradicts GOZ letters to the UN.  The GOZ claims it has </p><p>resettled 350,000 black farmers on the subdivided commercial </p><p>farms, but based on anecdotal evidence and ad-hoc </p><p>observation, we estimate that fewer than 100,000 have taken </p><p>up residence and fewer than 40,000 are actually farming.  As </p><p>noted reftel, we believe it is difficult to view fast-track </p><p>land reform as anything but a failure at this juncture.  The </p><p>controversial program will devastate tobacco production, </p><p>formerly Zimbabwe\'s largest foreign exchange earner and top </p><p>private sector employer.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Despite the GOZ\'s claims that land resettlement is a fait </p><p>accompli, there is little indication that the process has </p><p>reached equilibrium.  Some commercial farmers have been </p><p>granted temporary relief through the courts based on </p><p>procedural defects in their acquisition orders, although most </p><p>of these expect to receive new acquisition orders at any </p><p>moment.  Other commercial farmers -- 111 total, and at least </p><p>twenty in the Karoi area according to one contact -- have </p><p>received new Section 8 acquisition orders since November 1. </p><p> </p><p>Actual Occupancy Difficult to Substantiate </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  Due to the fluid situation regarding validity of </p><p>acquisition notices, geographical intensity of settler / war </p><p>veteran activity, and individual resistance on the part of </p><p>evicted farmers, there is no consensus as to how many </p><p>commercial farmers remain on their property.  There is </p><p>similar lack of consensus on how many "new farmers" have been </p><p>settled.  Most observers concur that at least 95% of </p><p>commercial farms (approximately 4,275 of 4,500) have received </p><p>acquisition notices, although some farmers remain on their </p><p>land and continue to resist acquisition through the courts </p><p>with varying degrees of success.  The closest estimate at </p><p>this point is that approximately 600 commercial farmers are </p><p>still attempting to produce something on their land, although </p><p>more than half of those continue to struggle against actual </p><p>seizure of their property.  The GOZ continues to claim that </p><p>300,000 indigenous farmers have been resettled under the A1 </p><p>small-holder model, and that 50,000 indigenous farmer have </p><p>been resettled under the A2, or "new" commercial farmer, </p><p>model.  The true levels of resettlement lie far below these </p><p>optimistic claims. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Occupation of resettled plots cannot be estimated with </p><p>any certainty, but visits by Post personnel to affected areas </p><p>indicate that productive cultivation of acquired farms is the </p><p>exception rather than the rule.  Even ZANU-PF supported news </p><p>reports concede that convincing A2 "new farmers" to take up </p><p>their plots has  been difficult.  It is less clear what </p><p>proportions of A1 farmers are on the land, but the GOZ figure </p><p>of 300,000 is almost certainly an exaggeration.  Moreover, </p><p>based on our personal observations, we believe that a </p><p>substantial portion of these small-scale farmers have not </p><p>planted a significant crop on resettled land.  The pattern </p><p>has been that plots containing buildings such as a homestead </p><p>or barns are occupied quickly, while the majority of plots </p><p>without such amenities remain abandoned.  The impact that </p><p>resettlement is having on individual agricultural sectors is </p><p>slightly easier to quantify. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Commercial Farmers\' Union Statistics </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Commercial Farmers\' Union (CFU), battered by GOZ </p><p>disdain and rocked by internal conflict, is desperately </p><p>attempting to maintain some degree of relevance in the </p><p>current chaotic situation.  Many CFU farmers, once they have </p><p>been evicted from their property, no longer maintain ties </p><p>with or forward information regarding their situations to the </p><p>CFU leadership.  However, the CFU remains one of the few </p><p>organizations attempting to quantify the situation of </p><p>commercial farmers as a whole.  The CFU claims that 90% of </p><p>white commercial farmers have been formally dispossessed of </p><p>their properties since the beginning of the land reforms in </p><p>2000.  At this point, the organization estimates that 600 </p><p>commercial farmers retain some physical control of their </p><p>property, although many remain under threat of acquisition. </p><p> </p><p>Commercial Tobacco Farmers Drop from 1,580 to 330 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Tobacco, long an integral part of Zimbabwe\'s economy </p><p>which accounted for up to a third of foreign exchange, </p><p>deserves special mention.  Zimbabwe produced its maximum </p><p>output of 220 million kilograms of tobacco in 2000. During </p><p>this last growing season, approximately 1,580 commercial </p><p>farmers produced 148 million kgs of high-grade tobacco, while </p><p>approximately 12,000 small-scale indigenous farmers produced </p><p>12 million kgs -- a reduction of 60 million kgs.  Owing to </p><p>experience and economies of scale, commercial growers can </p><p>produce between 2,500 and 3,000 kgs per hectare, while </p><p>small-scale growers generally produce around 1,000 kgs per </p><p>hectare. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA), an apolitical </p><p>industry group whose survival depends on the success of </p><p>small-scale growers, keeps fairly close estimates of tobacco </p><p>grower activity.  ZTA states that approximately 330 </p><p>large-scale commercial growers are attempting to produce a </p><p>crop during the next season.  Of those commercial growers, </p><p>the ZTA believes that at least half are facing continued GOZ </p><p>attempts to acquire their land.  The ZTA estimates that next </p><p>year\'s tobacco crop could result in 70 million kgs, if </p><p>commercial growers can maintain control of their land through </p><p>the harvest and curing process.  Other observers are </p><p>predicting a maximum crop size of 20 to 30 million kgs. </p><p>Although seed sales indicate that next season\'s crop could </p><p>theoretically equal last year\'s yield, many factors suggest </p><p>that this -- along with the GOZ\'s euphoric predictions of a </p><p>2003 crop in excess of 300 million kgs -- is merely wishful </p><p>thinking. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. According to the ZTA, tobacco is a chemical-intensive </p><p>crop, requiring expensive insecticides and fertilizers </p><p>throughout the growing period, and the "new" small-scale </p><p>farmers (who, without title to their land, have little </p><p>collateral for bank loans) have been given scant GOZ </p><p>assistance.  Additionally, many existing small-scale farmers </p><p>previously received significant assistance from their </p><p>commercial farmer neighbors in the form of tobacco seedlings, </p><p>chemicals, and assistance with tillage.  With the </p><p>dispossession of the vast majority of the commercial farmers, </p><p>much of this assistance has disappeared.  Finally, production </p><p>of the most valuable product -- flue-cured tobacco -- is a </p><p>labor-intensive skill acquired through years of experience. </p><p>Zimbabwean commercial farmers have been developing their </p><p>skills over generations, and assuming that any farmer with a </p><p>plot of land and a hoe can equal their quality or quantity of </p><p>production is naive at best. While some tobacco will be </p><p>produced, Zimbabwe\'s days as the biggest producer of </p><p>flue-cured tobacco  -- as well as the days when tobacco </p><p>earned 30% of Zimbabwe\'s forex -- are finished. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Commercial farming has become a ghost industry, with </p><p>operators few and far between, while hundreds of thousands of </p><p>hectares of formerly productive fields lie barren and wasted </p><p>under the husbandry of the "new farmers."  Some small-scale, </p><p>indigenous and new commercial farmers will succeed, and some </p><p>may even be profitable.  However, when weighed against the </p><p>phenomenally productive and lucrative commercial farming </p><p>sector of several years ago, even the GOZ will be </p><p>hard-pressed to present these isolated successes as a victory. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
