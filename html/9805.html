<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001432 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, SA/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, PHUM, NP, BT, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: PLANS FOR BHUTANESE REFUGEE REPATRIATION </p><p>STILL UNCLEAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 215687 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  DCM met with Madan Kumar Bhattarai, MFA </p><p>Acting Secretary and Joint Secretary for South Asia, on July </p><p>31 to discuss progress toward a durable solution for the </p><p>Bhutanese refugee problem in Eastern Nepal as instructed </p><p>reftel.  Bhattarai admitted that the Government of Nepal and </p><p>Royal Government of Bhutan did not see eye-to-eye on the </p><p>issue of third party involvement and that the GON looked </p><p>favorably upon UNHCR participation.  He did not believe many </p><p>Khundunabari Camp refugees would successfully appeal their </p><p>categorization, indicating that only 10-12 appeal cases were </p><p>being seriously considered by the Bhutanese Joint </p><p>Verification Team members.  Bhattarai claimed that both </p><p>Category I and II refugees would begin repatriation on </p><p>September 25.  However, the GON has not yet begun internal </p><p>discussions on a local resettlement program, he said. </p><p>Moreover, Bhattarai did not know whether the RGOB had begun </p><p>making logistical arrangements for the September </p><p>repatriation.  Post continues to be deeply concerned that </p><p>neither the RGOB or GON is truly committed to reintegrating </p><p>the refugees into their local communities.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 31, DCM Robert Boggs, accompanied by PolOff, </p><p>met with Madan Kumar Bhattarai, MFA Acting Secretary and </p><p>Joint Secretary for South Asia, to discuss reftel points. </p><p>The DCM opened the meeting by expressing concern that the </p><p>practical issues involving the transportation and </p><p>repatriation of refugees to Bhutan have not been adequately </p><p>addressed by the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB).  If the </p><p>RGOB is not committed to upholding international standards </p><p>for refugee resettlement, then the USG fears that refugees </p><p>will choose not to return to Bhutan and instead seek </p><p>resettlement in Nepal and elsewhere.  Involvement of the </p><p>UNHCR or other international NGOs in the verification and </p><p>resettlement process would help to alleviate the refugees\' </p><p>uncertainties, he said.  The DCM also highlighted USG </p><p>concerns that the dashed aspirations of those refugees who </p><p>are not guaranteed Bhutanese citizenship will create a </p><p>fertile breeding ground within the camps for extremist groups </p><p>from either Bhutan or Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Bhattarai admitted that the GON and RGOB did not see </p><p>eye-to-eye regarding international involvement in the </p><p>verification and repatriation process.  The GON recognizes </p><p>that the objective of the international community is to have </p><p>a positive impact on the issue, he said, and as such looks </p><p>favorably upon UNHCR involvement.  Bhattarai claimed that the </p><p>GON also had attempted to impress on the Government of India </p><p>the need for international assistance, but without success. </p><p>He mentioned that Indian National Security Advisor Brajesh </p><p>Mishra would be departing soon for another visit to Thimpu to </p><p>discuss border security issues. He implied that he did not </p><p>expect refugee repatriation to be on Mishra\'s agenda. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The DCM inquired into the results of the Nepal-Bhutan </p><p>Joint Verification Team\'s (JVT) review of the appeals </p><p>submitted by 94 percent of Khundunabari Camp residents. </p><p>Bhattarai replied that although July 31 was the last day for </p><p>review of appeals, recommendations would not negotiated </p><p>bilaterallyl until the 15th Joint Ministerial, scheduled to </p><p>take place in Thimpu during August 11-15.  He confided that </p><p>the Bhutanese JVT members were giving serious consideration </p><p>to only 10-12 cases.  The Nepali side, however, has reviewed </p><p>far more cases than the Bhutanese, Bhattarai said, although </p><p>he did not specify how many.  Bhattarai stated that because </p><p>the Bhutanese and Nepali JVT teams did not agree on which </p><p>appeals merited a review, the two sides would likely submit </p><p>differing recommendations to the August Ministerial. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Bhattarai refuted fears by some in the international </p><p>community that the RGOB plans to accept only Category I </p><p>refugees (Bhutanese citizens).  "Both Category I and II will </p><p>go," he said.  When asked about GON preparations to resettle </p><p>in Nepal those refugees who choose not to repatriate to </p><p>Bhutan, Bhattarai said that his government had not begun </p><p>internal discussions on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The DCM then asked whether the GON was aware if any </p><p>logistical arrangements had been made to prepare for the </p><p>September 25 departure of the refugees from Khundunabari </p><p>Camp.  Bhattarai replied that the GON was not aware of any </p><p>arrangements the RGOB might have made to receive the </p><p>returning refugees, but that the GON expects the RGOB to </p><p>report on its activities in this area at the August </p><p>Ministerial. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment.  Post is concerned over the continuing lack </p><p>of information on the RGOB\'s logistical arrangements for the </p><p>repatriation of Khundunabari Camp refugees to Bhutan.  These </p><p>arrangments are supposed to be finalized at the August </p><p>Ministerial, which begins in less than two weeks.  The issue </p><p>of granting some of the refugees Nepali citizenship is a </p><p>political hot potato.  Thousands of people of Indian </p><p>extraction living in the Terai for generations are still </p><p>without Nepali citizenship.  Although the GON might be </p><p>willing to allow some refugees to resettle locally, Post </p><p>doubts the GON will seriously consider granting citizenship, </p><p>leaving the refugees as stateless persons.  Post will again </p><p>raise this issue with MFA Secretary Acharya upon his return </p><p>to Kathmandu.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
