<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000386 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: PUSHING BACK ON CENSORSHIP: "ARARAT" AND FREEDOM </p><p>OF THOUGHT </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Istanbul contacts claim the overall climate </p><p>for free expression continues to improve.  While the GOT </p><p>continues to censor works dealing with the Kurdish issue and </p><p>other sensitive topics, improvements in legislation have </p><p>strengthened the underlying legal basis for freedom of </p><p>expression.  The film "Ararat," which runs headfirst into one </p><p>of the most sensitive political issues in Turkey, the tragic </p><p>massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during the early </p><p>twentieth century, is not expected to face obstacles to its </p><p>release in Turkey.  These Istanbul contacts ascribe most </p><p>problems with censorship not to specific government policies, </p><p>but to narrow-minded bureaucrats who are stubbornly resistant </p><p>to change.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Freedom of Thought Movement </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Author and free speech activist Sanar Yurdatapan </p><p>described the work of his Freedom of Thought movement, which </p><p>began in 1995 as a signature campaign in support of renowned </p><p>author Yasar Kemal, who was under investigation for a letter </p><p>he had published in a national daily.  Using a Turkish law </p><p>that held writers and publishers equally responsible for </p><p>their publications, Yurdatapan and over 1000 supporters </p><p>"re-published" Kemal\'s letter, thereby forcing the </p><p>prosecutors to open cases against all of them.  The cases </p><p>dragged on for years, eventually resulting in dismissals for </p><p>the defendants.   In the meantime, the movement replicated </p><p>these tactics and began to publish regular compilations of </p><p>writings and transcripts that had been subject to </p><p>investigations and trials, using prominent names as </p><p>"publishers" to publicize the cases and shame the system into </p><p>acquitting the defendants.  The movement continues to publish </p><p>one or more pamphlets each year and supports the original </p><p>defendants in their legal battles in the courts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Film Review and Rating Commission </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>3. (U) Film directors, producers, and distributors generally </p><p>fare somewhat better than their prose counterparts.  Unlike </p><p>publishers, however, film producers and distributors must </p><p>submit films to the Review and Rating Commissions (RRC) for </p><p>an age-based suitability rating and prior approval before </p><p>they can distribute them to theaters.  Legislative reforms in </p><p>1991 established a Lower RRC with 3 members (2 appointed by </p><p>the industry, one by the state) and a Higher RRC with 7 </p><p>members (4 appointed by the industry, 2 by the state, and one </p><p>by the National Security Council).  Only particularly </p><p>controversial and sensitive cases are submitted to the Higher </p><p>RRC.  According to Bedahattin Cetin, President of Belge Film </p><p>(a film distribution company specializing in foreign and </p><p>artistic films) and Vice President of the National Film </p><p>Platform (an industry coalition), only one film has been </p><p>denied marketing approval since the RRCs were established. </p><p>That film, "Big Man, Small Love," was subsequently granted </p><p>approval by the courts (and won national accolades), although </p><p>the director herself is still the subject of an ongoing court </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ararat": No Problems Expected </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>4. (U) Cetin currently owns the distribution rights for </p><p>"Ararat," the film written and directed by Atom Egoyan about </p><p>the mass killing of Armenians that took place in 1915 in the </p><p>waning days of the Ottoman Empire.  Cetin told poloff that he </p><p>expects a very limited demand for the film, perhaps no more </p><p>than three screens.  Although there were local press reports </p><p>last year when the film first came to public attention that </p><p>the then-National Security Council described it as the </p><p>greatest threat to Turkey since "Midnight Express," Cetin </p><p>assured poloff that he has not experienced, nor does he </p><p>anticipate, any problems or obstacles in bringing the film to </p><p>Turkey.  "In fact, a government minister personally </p><p>congratulated me on taking the initiative," Cetin said. </p><p>Cetin did note that he planned to edit a particularly violent </p><p>and shocking rape scene, but not for political reasons (Cetin </p><p>claims that, upon hearing his concerns, the film\'s director </p><p>admitted that the same scene had been edited for U.S. </p><p>distribution).   Cetin\'s primary concerns are about the </p><p>timing of the film\'s release in relation to a possible war in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Narrow-Minded Bureaucrats </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) Both Yurdatapan and Cetin told poloff that the primary </p><p>obstacles to freedom of expression are narrow-minded </p><p>bureaucrats who are generally inclined to ignore legislative </p><p>changes that protect the rights of writers, journalists, and </p><p>film makers.  Asked whether there might be a link between the </p><p>level and type of harassment and which political parties are </p><p>in government, both said they had not detected any such </p><p>pattern.   According to Yurdatapan, many, if not most, of the </p><p>cases filed against writers and journalists are eventually </p><p>dismissed in the courts.  The cases and trials themselves, </p><p>however, continue to be used as a form of harassment.  As for </p><p>films, despite having prior approval from the RRCs, Cetin </p><p>admitted that local governors still have the authority to </p><p>pull films from the theaters and send them to court if they </p><p>believe they are subversive.  The American film "Basic </p><p>Instinct" and the Iranian-Kurdish film "A Time for Drunken </p><p>Horses," for example, were pulled from theaters in separate </p><p>provinces on the order of local governors (the former for its </p><p>explicit sexuality, the latter for its portrayal of the </p><p>Kurds).  The courts overturned the bans in both cases and the </p><p>increased publicity that resulted led to long and successful </p><p>runs in the theaters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (U) If the opening of "Ararat" goes as smoothly as Cetin </p><p>predicts, it would indeed be a positive sign.  However, to </p><p>date, it remains unclear whether recent reforms will lead to </p><p>a broad loosening of state censorship.  The Publishers\' </p><p>Association of Turkey reports that, in 2002, the GOT opened </p><p>cases against 67 books and leveled charges against 35 </p><p>publishers and 48 writers; in 2001, the GOT took such action </p><p>against 42 books, 23 publishers and 38 writers.  The GOT </p><p>continues to level charges of separatism against writers and </p><p>publishers of works dealing with the Kurdish issue or using </p><p>the word "Kurdistan." </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
