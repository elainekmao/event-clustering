THEY </p><p>WERE BEATEN WITH POLICE BATONS, RIFLES, PISTOLS AND HEAVY </p><p>BOOTS.  SOMETIMES GROUPS OF ABOUT 10 WERE CALLED OUT AND </p><p>BEATEN.  THE MEN SAID THAT TOWARDS THE END OF THEIR </p><p>DETENTION, ONE SUCH GROUP OF TWELVE WAS BADLY BEATEN, THEN </p><p>WAS TAKEN OUT BEHIND THE BUILDING AND SHOT AT CLOSE RANGE. </p><p>ONLY ONE MAN SURVIVED.  (WE WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THIS </p><p>INDIVIDUAL.)  THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED NEAR THE END OF THEIR </p><p>DETENTION AT SANAKERAM.

HOWEVER, GUARDS CONSTANTLY STOOD VIGIL </p><p>AROUND THE BUILDING AND WERE SEEN BY THE MEN THROUGH THE </p><p>WINDOWS THAT LINED THREE SIDES OF THE CAFETERIA.

ONE </p><p>PRISONER SAID ABOUT 20 OF THEM HAD SERBIAN ACCENTS. </p><p>OTHERS SPOKE WITH A LOCAL ACCENT.  THE MAYOR SAID THAT </p><p>THREE BURNED BODIES HAD BEEN FOUND IN AN INDUSTRIAL OVEN </p><p>IN THE FACTORY WHEN IT WAS LIBERATED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  AT THE SANAKERAM FACILITY, A CRIPPLED EX- </p><p>DETAINEE, ABOUT 40, WHO HAD RETURNED TO SEARCH FOR A COAT </p><p>HE HAD LEFT BEHIND, SHOWED US THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS HELD. </p><p>A POTENT FETID SMELL OVERWHELMED THE GROUP ON ENTERING THE </p><p>CAFETERIA.  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD LIVED </p><p>THERE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS. </p><p>BLOOD AND EXCREMENT STAINS REMAINED ON THE WALLS AND </p><p>FLOORS OF THE CAFETERIA, THE ENTRANCE, AND OTHER SMALL </p><p>OFFICES.  OUR IMPROMPTU GUIDE POINTED OUT POSITIONS WHERE </p><p>GUARDS HAD STOOD WATCH OVER THE BUILDING AND THE PLACES OF </p><p>THE FIRING SQUAD AS THEY SHOT THE 11 PRISONERS.

AT DZEVAR FIELD, THEY </p><p>SAT DOWN WITH THEIR HEADS LOWERED AND A SOLDIER EXCLAIMED </p><p>THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE KILLED.  ONE DOCTOR AMONG THE </p><p>MUSLIMS THEN STEPPED OUT AND TOOK ASIDE A SOLDIER WHO </p><p>APPEARED TO BE IN COMMAND.  THE SOLDIERS MADE THE MEN SIT </p><p>IN THE SHADOWS, UNDER TREES.  AFTER ONE HOUR, THE GROUP </p><p>WAS BROUGHT WATER.  THEY STARTED MARCHING AGAIN, AND </p><p>REACHED THE VILLAGE OF RASAVCI, OVER FIFTEEN KM FROM THE </p><p>FACTORY, BEFORE TRUCKS ARRIVED TO TAKE THEM TO THEIR </p><p>DESTINATION. </p><p> </p><p>9.

NO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION VISITED THEM.  WHEN </p><p>VISITORS ARRIVED, THE SOLDIERS HID THE PRISONERS IN THE </p><p>WOODS FOR HOURS UNTIL THE STRANGERS LEFT.  CONDITIONS AT </p><p>THIS CENTER WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN SANSKI MOST.  FOOD </p><p>WAS IRREGULAR.  BEATINGS OCCURRED REGULARLY.

HE REPORTED FIRING SQUAD KILLINGS IN </p><p>THE VILLAGES OF TRNOVA AND SEJKOVACA: 8-15 PEOPLE DIED IN </p><p>EACH INSTANCE.
