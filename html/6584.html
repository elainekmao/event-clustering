<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001793 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 20: CONTAINED REACTION FOR </p><p>NOW </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Initial Market Reaction Limited </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) At OOB March 20, Turkish markets opened sharply down, </p><p>but recovered somewhat as the morning went on.  JP </p><p>MOrgan/Chase bond trader Gumisdis, Yapi Kredi Bank Treasurer </p><p>Imece and other market players here all pointed to the Ari </p><p>Fleischer statement that "the White House has not ruled out </p><p>assistance for Turkey in this matter." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira is currently trading at TL 1,703,000 to the </p><p>dollar (a one percent depreciation from yesterday); </p><p>--  T-bill yields are 67 percent compounded (up two </p><p>percentage points from yesterday); </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index is down 1.5 percent </p><p>in morning trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Helpful Central Bank Statement </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) At OOB March 20, the Central Bank issued a statement </p><p>that traders this morning credited with dampening dollar </p><p>demand.  It  said the CBT is prepared to take certain </p><p>measures that may be needed to maintain financial stability. </p><p>They are: a TL liquidity facility so banks could borrow (at </p><p>rates higher than the current money markets) to meet </p><p>extraordinary cash needs; one-week dollar deposits to banks, </p><p>again at higher than market interest rates.  The statement </p><p>(issued only in Turkish) read in part: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "Turkish Lira Market.  The liquidity level of TL is </p><p>sufficient to meet the needs of the financial system.  Still, </p><p>if any liquidity need arises, the required liquidity could be </p><p>provided through the Central Bank establishing a \'Late </p><p>Liquidity Window\' in the interbank money market that would </p><p>become active, if needed, during the hours 16:00-16:30." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "Foreign Exchange Market.   In the extraordinary case of </p><p>extra FX demand in the market, and in order to secure the </p><p>smooth operation of the FX market, the Central Bank would be </p><p>prepared to provide to banks U.S. Dollar deposits of one-week </p><p>maturities, within the borrowing banks\' borrowing limits. </p><p>The interest rate on such deposits would be between 12-8 </p><p>percent per annum." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Other Public Statements Less Helpful </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Deputy PM and FM Gul gave a Reuters interview given </p><p>on March 19 and published mid-morning March 20.  It reads in </p><p>part as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- "It would be wrong to link the whole Turkish economy to a </p><p>U.S. package.  It is important to take the right measures in </p><p>the economy and to implement the economic program in a right </p><p>way, to prepare the budget accordingly and to provide fiscal </p><p>discipline." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "We already told the U.S. that we would have military </p><p>forces in Northern Iraq and there was a mutual understanding </p><p>on this in yesterday\'s (i.e. March 18) meeting." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Treasury U/S Oztrak Plan </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) IMF resrep Brekk met with Treasury U/S Oztrak on </p><p>March 20 am and told us that Oztrak has proposed to the GOT </p><p>that PM Erdogan issue a statement today with detailed, </p><p>strengthened economic reform measures.  Oztrak\'s strategy, </p><p>per IMF resrep, was for Erdogan to make a statement by early </p><p>afternoon Ankara time, to which the IMF spokesman could </p><p>respond at the IMF weekly press meeting at 9:30 am Washington </p><p>time today.   However, as of 2:30 pm local time, Oztrak had </p><p>not yet obtained full GOT agreement on the content of the new </p><p>measures, and thus no statement is planned for the moment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Resrep added that he was prepared to work urgently </p><p>with the GOT, acting on guidance from his headquarters (since </p><p>IMF staff cannot travel to Turkey now).  Resrep believes the </p><p>draft LOI could be revised in several days of work to reflect </p><p>a war scenario, involving more GOT borrowing needs, a tighter </p><p>budget and fiscal measures to support it.  He stressed that </p><p>the IMF had already given the GOT a list of fiscal measures, </p><p>most of which they have yet to adopt, that could achieve the </p><p>needed fiscal tightening.  He singled out public sector wage </p><p>cuts as the most important measure, which he said MinSate </p><p>Babacan is resisting in talks with Oztrak. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
