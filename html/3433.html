<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004317 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, August 5, </p><p>highlight yesterday\'s "wave" of Palestinian attacks </p><p>against Israelis, including a suicide bus bombing in </p><p>the north of Israel.  Headlines mark the attacks as a </p><p>retaliation by the Palestinian resistance to Israel\'s </p><p>brutality against the Palestinian people.  Stories </p><p>also carry President Bush\'s "condemnation" of the </p><p>attacks and the Palestinian and Israeli reactions. </p><p>Editorial commentaries hold Israel responsible for the </p><p>continuation of the violence </p><p> </p><p>      Editorial Commentary on Middle East Issues </p><p> </p><p>-- "The occupation and the suffering of the </p><p>Palestinians" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(08/05):  "Israel\'s crimes go almost unnoticed by the </p><p>international media and hardly receive any coverage if </p><p>compared with the coverage given to a suicide bombing </p><p>inside Israeli territories.  This international </p><p>silence towards the Palestinians\' incredible suffering </p><p>under occupation is being used by Sharon and his </p><p>government to continue his cycle of killings and </p><p>destruction.  Meanwhile, the main and only reason for </p><p>this tragedy continues to be overlooked, namely the </p><p>occupation.  The return of the suicide bombings to </p><p>what they used to be puts Sharon and even Bush in </p><p>tight spot, simply because the Palestinian Authority </p><p>no longer exists on the ground, and the only real </p><p>presence of security in the West Bank is for the </p><p>Israeli army.  This suggests their failure to bring </p><p>the Palestinian people down to their knees and to </p><p>strip them of their spirit and their resistance." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Israeli terrorism springs violence in Palestine" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Rakan Majali writes on the back page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic Al-Dustour (08/05): </p><p>"Even Israeli newspapers are saying that Israeli </p><p>confrontations, escalation and the use of its military </p><p>machine will only lead to more suicide bombings. </p><p>Whatever Israel decides to call these bombings, the </p><p>outcome is the same, namely that the state of </p><p>frustration and desperation, that results from the </p><p>Hebrew State\'s exercise of humiliation and oppression </p><p>against Palestinian people and denial of their rights, </p><p>will only lead to more bloodshed. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
