<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 CARACAS 003637 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: HUGO CHAVEZ WINS IN A LANDSLIDE </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  HUGO CHAVEZ FRIAS WON THE DECEMBER 6 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN </p><p>A LANDSLIDE, BESTING HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER 56 PERCENT TO 39 PERCENT. </p><p>WITH MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF THE VOTE COUNTED, THE NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) DECLARED CHAVEZ THE WINNER LESS THAN THREE </p><p>HOURS AFTER THE POLLS HAD CLOSED.  THESE ELECTIONS, A MODEL OF </p><p>DECORUM AND ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY, BROUGHT APPROXIMATELY </p><p>SEVENTY PERCENT OF VENEZUELA\'S ELECTORATE TO THE POLLS IN A </p><p>PEACEFUL AND SUCCESSFUL VOTE OBSERVED BY MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  DEFEATED CANDIDATE SALAS ROMER, IN A </p><p>GRACIOUS AND STATESMANLIKE CONCESSION SPEECH, PROMISED TO WORK WITH </p><p>CHAVEZ TO ACHIEVE THE "RADICAL CHANGE" NECESSARY TO REFORM </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, MAKE ITS DEMOCRACY MORE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE, AND IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF ITS </p><p>CITIZENS.  CHAVEZ, FOR HIS PART, DECLARED THAT HE HAD "NO POLITICAL </p><p>ENEMIES," AND REACHED OUT TO HIS ELECTORAL ADVERSARIES, DECLARING </p><p>THAT THROUGH RECONCILIATION VENEZUELA CAN OVERCOME ITS DIVISIONS </p><p>AND CONFRONT ITS MAJOR CHALLENGES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>CHAVEZ BY A LANDSLIDE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  HUGO CHAVEZ FRIAS WAS PRONOUNCED THE WINNER OF THE DECEMBER 6 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS BY THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) LESS </p><p>THAN THREE HOURS AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED.  THE LIGHTENING VOTE </p><p>COUNT, FACILITATED BY SUCCESSFUL AUTOMATION OF THE VOTING PROCESS, </p><p>HAD TABULATED MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE VOTE FROM MORE THAN </p><p>SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE POLLING STATIONS, GIVING CHAVEZ A PROJECTED </p><p>VICTORY OVER HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER BY A MARGIN OF 17 PERCENTAGE </p><p>POINTS (56 PERCENT TO 39 PERCENT).  THIS IS THE LARGEST MARGIN OF </p><p>VICTORY IN A VENEZUELAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE 1983, WHEN </p><p>JAIME LUSINCHI BEAT RAFAEL CALDERA BY 57 PERCENT TO 34 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>A GOOD, CLEAN ELECTION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE DECEMBER 6 VOTE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY DECORUM AND </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY.  IN CONTRAST TO THE NOVEMBER 8 REGIONAL </p><p>ELECTIONS, QUICK VOTING WAS FACILITATED BY PUNCTUAL OPENING OF THE </p><p>VOTING CENTERS, IMPROVED ORGANIZATION, AND A SIMPLER BALLOT. </p><p>ALTHOUGH INITIAL ESTIMATES OF VOTER TURNOUT WERE A FULL 15 PERCENT </p><p>HIGHER THAN THE NOVEMBER 8 VOTE (70 PERCENT TODAY;55 PERCENT </p><p>NOVEMBER 8), VOTERS MOVED THROUGH THE VOTING CENTERS QUICKLY AND </p><p>EASILY, ONLY RARELY EXPERIENCING LONG LINES OR WAITS.  THE INFORMAL </p><p>CONSENSUS OF THE NEARLY 300 INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS INVITED TO </p><p>WATCH THE ELECTIONS WAS THAT THE ELECTIONS WERE WELL RUN AND WELL </p><p>RECEIVED.  AGAIN, OBSERVERS FROM ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE CARTER </p><p>CENTER, THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE, THE NATIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE, THE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR ELECTORAL </p><p>SYSTEMS, THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES, AND OVER FORTY </p><p>MEMBERS OF THIS EMBASSY, NOTED THE DETERMINATION OF VENEZUELAN </p><p>VOTERS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE AND TO EXPRESS THEIR DESIRE </p><p>FOR SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL CHANGE THROUGH THE ELECTORAL AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>SALAS CONCEDES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  FOLLOWING THE PRONOUNCEMENT OF THE CNE DECLARING CHAVEZ THE </p><p>PROJECTED WINNER OF THE ELECTIONS, CANDIDATE HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER </p><p>OFFICIALLY CONCEDED VICTORY TO HUGO CHAVEZ.  SALAS ROMER, IN A </p><p>GRACIOUS AND STATESMANLIKE FASHION, CONGRATULATED CHAVEZ FOR HIS </p><p>VICTORY, AND PROMISED TO WORK WITH CHAVEZ TO ACHIEVE THE "RADICAL </p><p>CHANGE" WHICH SO MANY VENEZUELANS WANT AND DEMAND FROM THEIR </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERS.  SALAS ROMER SAID HE WOULD NOT RETIRE FROM </p><p>POLITICS, BUT INSTEAD WOULD IMMERSE HIMSELF EVEN DEEPER IN THE </p><p>EFFORT TO REFORM VENEZUELA\'S PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, MAKE ITS </p><p>DEMOCRACY MORE REPRESENTATIVE, AND IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING </p><p>OF ITS CITIZENS.  HE PUT CHAVEZ ON NOTICE THAT HE AND HIS </p><p>SUPPORTERS WOULD HOLD HIM TO HIS WORD TO AFFECT RADICAL CHANGE </p><p>WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF DEMOCRACY AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>CHAVEZ REACHES OUT TO HIS ADVERSARIES </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  CHAVEZ, IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE </p><p>CNE\'S PRONOUNCEMENT, SAID HE HAD NO "POLITICAL ENEMIES" AND CALLED </p><p>ON HIS ELECTORAL ADVERSARIES TO WORK WITH HIM TO CONSTRUCT A NEW </p><p>VENEZUELA.  HE REACHED OUT TO HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER AND HIS PARTY, </p><p>PROYECTO VENEZUELA, ALONG WITH THE DEMOCRATIC ACTION PARTY (AD), </p><p>THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY (COPEI), AND OTHERS, TO JOIN HIM IN HIS </p><p>ATTACK ON THE CORRUPTION, IMPUNITY, AND POOR MANAGEMENT WHICH HAVE </p><p>RENDERED THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT WEAK, INEFFECTIVE, AND DESPISED. </p><p>CHAVEZ SAID IT WAS TIME TO "FORGIVE AND FORGET" AND THAT ONLY </p><p>THROUGH RECONCILIATION COULD VENEZUELA FIND THE UNITY TO CONFRONT </p><p>ITS MAJOR CHALLENGES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>AND TO THE MILITARY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  CHAVEZ, DURING THE INTERVIEW, SAID HE HAD REQUESTED THE GOV TO </p><p>BRING HOME FROM WASHINGTON GENERAL RAUL SALAZAR SO THAT SALAZAR </p><p>COULD PREPARE TO BECOME CHAVEZ\'S MINISTER OF DEFENSE.  CHAVEZ ALSO </p><p>PRAISED THE CURRENT MILITARY HIGH COMMAND FOR ITS STRONG, </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL ROLE DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>ADMIRAL TITO RINCON BRAVO, FOLLOWING THE CNE PRONOUNCEMENT, TOLD </p><p>THE PRESS THAT THE ARMED FORCES WOULD CONTINUE ITS ROLE AS GUARANTOR </p><p>OF THE CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND WOULD FULLY </p><p>SUPPORT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  WE STILL AWAIT CHAVEZ\'S FIRST MAJOR PRONOUNCEMENTS AS </p><p>PRESIDENT-ELECT, WHICH WILL COME LATER THIS EVENING.  HOWEVER, WE </p><p>KNOW THAT CHAVEZ\'S ELECTION MARKS AN HISTORIC MILESTONE IN </p><p>VENEZUELAN POLITICAL HISTORY, AND WILL PRESENT THIS COUNTRY NEW AND </p><p>SPECIAL CHALLENGES IN THE MONTHS TO COME.  THE PEACEFUL VOTE AND </p><p>THE CELEBRATIONS WHICH FOLLOWED THE PRONOUNCEMENT OF CHAVEZ\'S </p><p>VICTORY--WHICH HAVE NOT FEATURED ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE OR </p><p>DISTURBANCE--ARE A TRIBUTE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CNE, THE </p><p>PREPARATION OF THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES CHARGED WITH </p><p>MAINTAINING PUBLIC ORDER, AND THE MATURITY OF THE VENEZUELAN VOTER. </p><p>IN THIS REGARD, THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OF DECEMBER 6, LIKE THE </p><p>REGIONAL ELECTIONS OF NOVEMBER 8, WERE A VICTORY FOR VENEZUELAN </p><p>DEMOCRACY AS MUCH AS FOR ANY SINGLE CANDIDATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
