REASON: 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: ON MAY 20, EUR PDAS RIES DISCUSSED A BROAD </p><p>RANGE OF US-EU AND ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY ISSUES DURING </p><p>SEPARATE MEETINGS WITH MFA SYG GIUSEPPE BALDOCCI AND DIRECTOR </p><p>FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION ROCCO CANGELOSI.  BOTH BALDOCCI AND </p><p>CANGELOSI STRESSED THAT THE GOI\'S TOP PRIORITY FOR THE </p><p>ITALIAN SEMESTER WAS PUTTING US-EU RELATIONS BACK ON A SOUND </p><p>FOOTING.  PDAS RIES SUGGESTED THAT THE JUNE 25 US-EU SUMMIT </p><p>IN WASHINGTON WAS AN APPROPRIATE VENUE TO START THAT PROCESS </p><p>AND SET THE STAGE FOR PRODUCTIVE AND POSITIVE USG RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY.  POTENTIAL AREAS OF COOPERATION </p><p>INCLUDED THE MEPP, IRAQ, NON-PROLIFERATION (DPRK AND IRAN), </p><p>AND THE TRANSATLANTIC BUSINESS DIALOGUE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  RIES WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE DCM, POLMIN, AND POLOFF </p><p>(NOTETAKER) TO BOTH THE OFFICE CALL ON BALDOCCI AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENT WORKING LUNCH HOSTED BY CANGELOSI.  ECMIN JOINED </p><p>THE GROUP FOR THE LUNCH.  BALDOCI HAD WITH HIM A NOTETAKER </p><p>(READOUT OF DINNER WITH GOI TRADE/ECON OFFICIALS FOLLOWS </p><p>SEPTEL; ESDP/EU STRATEGIC CONCEPT DISCUSSION ALSO REPORTED </p><p>SEPTEL).  WITH CANGELOSI WERE CLAUDIO BISOGNIERO (DEPUTY TO </p><p>POLDIR ARAGONA), EU EXTERNAL RELATIONS OFFICE DIRECTOR </p><p>MASSIMO GAIANI, AND WTO COORDINATOR FABIO FABRI.  RIES BEGAN </p><p>BY NOTING THAT DURING THIS PHASE OF HIS EU NEW-MEMBER "ROAD </p><p>SHOW" WHICH PRECEDED HIS STOP IN ROME, HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO </p><p>DISCOVER THAT HIS INTERLOCUTORS WERE FAMILIAR WITH EU </p><p>PROCEDURES AND THE COMPLEXITIES AND SUBTLETIES OF THE US-EU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02299  01 OF 03  231111Z </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  IN RESPONSE TO BALDOCCI\'S REQUEST FOR HIS </p><p>VIEWS ON "NEW AND OLD" EUROPE, RIES SAID THAT THE DIVIDE WAS </p><p>RATHER BETWEEN THOSE COUNTRIES WITH MINIMAL GROWTH AND THOSE </p><p>WITH RELATIVELY HEALTHIER ECONOMIES AND PROSPECTS.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, GERMANY AND FRANCE WERE UNDERSTANDABLY MORE </p><p>PREOCCUPIED ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE US IN THE BROADER GLOBAL </p><p>COMMUNITY THAN ITALY AND THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL EUROPE </p><p>WHICH HAVE MORE ROBUST ECONOMIES AND MORE CONFIDENCE THAT THE </p><p>EU CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE WITH THE US. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) RIES AVERRED THAT THE US AND EU HAD "PASSED THE LOW </p><p>WATER MARK" IN THEIR RELATIONS.  BALDOCCI AGREED, AND SAID </p><p>THAT THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS WAS TO </p><p>FOCUS ON AREAS OF COMMON INTEREST; THE BALKANS, MIDDLE EAST </p><p>AND TERRORISM, FOR EXAMPLE, REPRESENT COMMON GROUND. </p><p>BALDOCCI CITED THE CASABLANCA BOMBINGS AS A NEW DEVELOPMENT </p><p>IN TERROR AND ANOTHER CLEAR REASON WHY EUROPE AND THE US MUST </p><p>WORK TOGETHER ON COMMON GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>4  (C)  RIES ASKED BALDOCCI ABOUT THE EU VIEW THAT </p><p>SENIOR-LEVEL DELEGATIONS SHOULD CALL ON BOTH ARAFAT AND PM </p><p>ABU MAZEN EQUALLY.  BALDOCCI RESPONDED THAT DURING A RECENT </p><p>MEETING IN CAIRO, EGYPTIAN FM MAHER SAID THAT ARAFAT RETAINS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL AND MORAL AUTHORITY AMONG PALESTINIANS, </p><p>AND THAT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO SHUNT HIM ASIDE.  ABU MAZEN </p><p>NEEDS THE PRESENCE OF ARAFAT AND HIS INFLUENCE.  IT WOULD BE </p><p>POSSIBLE, BALDOCCI AGREED, TO INTERACT ONLY WITH THE NEW PM </p><p>AND FORGET ARAFAT, WHO REPRESENTS THE POLITICAL PAST.  BUT </p><p>BALDOCCI WONDERED IF THAT LOGIC, WHICH WORKS IN THE WEST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02299  01 OF 03  231111Z </p><p>(WHERE A FORMER PM OR PRESIDENT IS OUT OF POWER ABSOLUTELY), </p><p>IS APPLICABLE TO THE MID EAST\'S POLITICAL REALITY AND </p><p>CULTURE.  POLMIN OBSERVED THAT ABU MAZEN\'S OFFICIAL POSITION </p><p>WOULD ALWAYS BE THAT SENIOR OFFICIALS SHOULD MEET WITH </p><p>ARAFAT, BUT THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT BEST SERVES OUR </p><p>COMMON INTEREST IN PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>UNSC RESOLUTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  RIES SAID THAT HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT MODIFICATIONS TO </p><p>THE UNSC RESOLUTION ON IRAQ, (REFTEL; SHARED WITH THE GOI </p><p>LATER THAT DAY) WOULD HELP ENSURE SWIFT PASSAGE THROUGH THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL.   KEY CHANGES INCLUDED A MORE ROBUST ROLE </p><p>FOR THE UN IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE </p><p>IRAQ DEVELOPMENT FUND.  THE DOCUMENT REPRESENTED AN EFFORT BY </p><p>THE US TO REACH CONSENSUS ON A RESOLUTION.  RIES HOPED FOR A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL VOTE SOON, FOR POLITICAL (PRIOR TO THE EVIAN G-8) </p><p>AND PRACTICAL (STORAGE FACILITIES AND REFINERIES WERE </p><p>DROWNING IN THE HEAVY FUEL OIL BYPRODUCT OF GASOLINE REFINED </p><p>FOR DOMESTIC IRAQI CONSUMPTION) REASONS.  IF WE HAVE A </p><p>RESOLUTION ON IRAQ, AND INCREASED STABILITY IN THE REGION, </p><p>SAID RIES, THE JUNE US-EU SUMMIT CAN FOCUS ON OUR OTHER AREAS </p><p>OF COMMON INTEREST, INTER ALIA: BALKANS, NON PROLIFERATION, </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, NEGOTIATION OF OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT, HYDROGEN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5759 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02299  02 OF 03  231111Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NRRC-00  NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      SSR-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------6A02D4  231111Z /38 </p><p>O 231105Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0072 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 002299 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NATO, EU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: PDAS RIES CONSULTATIONS WITH GOI ON PRESIDENCY </p><p>PRIORITIES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02299  02 OF 03  231111Z </p><p> </p><p>ENERGY, COUNTERTERRORISM/MLAT NEGOTIATIONS, DATA PRIVACY.  ON </p><p>GALILEO, WE ARE GETTING CLOSE; NOT YET ON TECHNICAL DETAILS </p><p>BUT ON A MORE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON SPECTRUM SEPARATION. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  RIES SAID AT BOTH MEETINGS THAT A NATO ROLE FOR IRAQ </p><p>WAS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION, BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IS FOR </p><p>THE RIGHT TYPE AND NUMBER OF FORCES TO BE IN PLACE AS THE IC </p><p>RESTORES STABILITY.  BISOGNIERO CONFIRMED THAT THE ITALIAN </p><p>DEPLOYMENT TO THE UK ZONE IN SOUTHERN IRAQ  WILL BEGIN IN </p><p>JUNE, AND THAT THE MOD HAS HAD GOOD COMMUNICATION AND </p><p>COORDINATION WITH BRITISH MILITARY OFFICIALS AND CENTCOM. </p><p>RIES EXPRESSED GRATITUDE FOR THE CONTRIBUTION, NOTING THAT </p><p>ITALIAN MILITARY AND SECURITY FORCES HAVE EARNED THE RESPECT </p><p>OF US AND ALLIED NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>BALKANS </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) RIES TOLD BALDOCCI THAT THE USG APPRECIATES THE GOI\'S </p><p>DESIRE TO REFOCUS EU ATTENTION ON THE BALKANS.  REGARDING THE </p><p>REPLACEMENT FOR UNMIK HEAD STEINER, WE WOULD LIKE A CANDIDATE </p><p>FROM A NATO COUNTRY - HAD THE GOI CONSIDERED ITALY\'S CURRENT </p><p>AMBASSADOR IN DAMASCUS, LAURA MIRACHIAN?   BALDOCCI SAID THAT </p><p>BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING HER NOMINATION HE WOULD NEED TO </p><p>CONSULT WITH HER SINCE SHE HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN BALKANS </p><p>ISSUES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PART OF HER CAREER, AND WANTED SOME </p><p>DIVERSITY.  ANOTHER COMPLICATION WAS THAT SHE WAS ALSO THE </p><p>ITALIAN CANDIDATE TO BE THE EU\'S MIDDLE EAST ENVOY.  HE </p><p>AGREED THOUGH THAT WE NEED TO THINK CAREFULLY, AND QUICKLY, </p><p>ABOUT AN APPROPRIATE REPLACEMENT FOR STEINER. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02299  02 OF 03  231111Z </p><p>8.  (C)  RIES SAID THE USG SHARES ITALY\'S CONCERNS ON </p><p>ORGANIZED CRIME, TRAFFICKING IN HUMANS - PARTICULARLY WOMEN </p><p>AND CHILDREN, AND  PIFWCS.  THE DCM NOTED THAT LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES, FOR EXAMPLE IN ALBANIA, WERE RIPE </p><p>FOR EU-US COOPERATION, AND THAT WE COULD BUILD ON ONGOING </p><p>PROGRAMS.  RIES UNDERLINED THE USG CONCERN THAT IC ECONOMIC </p><p>ASSISTANCE WAS DECLINING AT A TIME CRITICAL FOR BALKAN </p><p>STABILITY DUE TO CROATIAN ASPIRATIONS TO REFORM AND JOIN </p><p>TRANSATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS, REFUGEE RETURNS, AND SERBIA AND </p><p>MONTENEGRO\'S NEED FOR CONTINUED IC ASSISTANCE.  BALDOCCI SAID </p><p>HE AND FM FRATTINI AGREED THAT THE IC MUST KEEP FOCUSED ON </p><p>THE BALKANS, AND WOULD USE THE PRESIDENCY\'S PLATFORM TO </p><p>HIGHLIGHT CRITICAL ISSUES.  CANGELOSI LATER SAID OVER LUNCH </p><p>THAT THE GOI WILL URGE THE COMMISSION TO AUGMENT DOWNSIZED </p><p>BALKAN RESOURCES BY ALLOWING THE WESTERN BALKAN 5 TO UTILIZE </p><p>"PRE-ACCESSION" FUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>DPRK </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM BALDOCCI ON PROGRESS </p><p>WITH NORTH KOREA, RIES SAID THE USG\'S OBJECTIVE IS TO GET </p><p>REGIONAL POWERS INVOLVED IN KEEPING PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA </p><p>TO COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL NONPROLIFERATION AGREEMENTS. </p><p>POLMIN POINTED OUT THAT A KEY FACTOR WAS RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT </p><p>AND INFLUENCE.  FRATTINI AND RUSSIAN FM IVANOV HAD DISCUSSED </p><p>DPRK EARLIER THIS MONTH; WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE RUSSIA MORE </p><p>INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>IRAN </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  RIES RAISED USG CONCERN OVER IRAN\'S ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02299  02 OF 03  231111Z </p><p>AUGMENT ITS NUCLEAR FUEL ENRICHMENT FACILITIES.  THE EU MUST </p><p>USE ITS LEVERAGE TO PUT PRESSURE ON IRAN TO SIGN THE IAEA </p><p>ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL.  BALDOCCI SAID THAT FRATTINI HAD URGED </p><p>KHARAZI TO SIGN, AND THAT BALDOCCI HIMSELF HAD IMPRESSED UPON </p><p>THE IRANIAN AMBASSADOR IN ROME RECENTLY THE NECESSITY OF </p><p>IRAN\'S SIGNING THE AGREEMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD BALDOCCI </p><p>HE WAS AWARE OF THE IC\'S VIEWS, BUT DOES NOT WANT IRAN TO BE </p><p>DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ON CIVILIAN USE OF NUCLEAR POWER.  RIES </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT -- AT THE LEAST -- THE US AND EU OUGHT TO </p><p>REQUIRE THAT ANY COUNTRY DESIRING COOPERATION ON NUCLEAR </p><p>FACILITY DEVELOPMENT MUST AGREE TO AND SIGN THE IAEA </p><p>ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL. </p><p> </p><p>EU-RUSSIA </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  CANGELOSI WORRIED THAT RUSSIA MIGHT HAVE </p><p>UNACHIEVABLE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ST. PETERSBURG SUMMIT AND </p><p>THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY, SUCH AS A VISA FREE REGIME, </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR ENLARGEMENT, AND NEW INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>MECHANISMS FOR COOPERATION.  HE PREDICTED THAT THE MOST </p><p>LIKELY OUTCOME FROM THE MAY 31 SUMMIT WOULD BE A "NAME </p><p>CHANGE" OF PRESENT MECHANISMS TO A "PERMANENT PARTNERSHIP." </p><p>THE EU IS EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF 25 1 MEETINGS ON </p><p>SELECTED ISSUES, AND PM BERLUSCONI AND FM FRATTINI ARE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5761 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02299  03 OF 03  231112Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NRRC-00  NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      SSR-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------6A02E5  231112Z /38 </p><p>O 231105Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0073 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 002299 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NATO, EU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: PDAS RIES CONSULTATIONS WITH GOI ON PRESIDENCY </p><p>PRIORITIES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02299  03 OF 03  231112Z </p><p> </p><p>DETERMINED THAT THE ROME EU-RUSSIA SUMMIT WILL FORGE CLOSER </p><p>LINKS BETWEEN MOSCOW AND BRUSSELS. </p><p> </p><p>TABD </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  CANGELOSI SAID THE GOI WAS GIVING THOUGHT TO USING </p><p>THE TRANSATLANTIC BUSINESS DIALOGUE AS A VEHICLE FOR HELPING </p><p>PUT TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS BACK ON TRACK.  WHAT DID RIES </p><p>THINK?  THE TABD IS STILL VALUABLE, BUT NEEDS REFORM, RIES </p><p>RESPONDED.  THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT IT HAS GROWN TOO LARGE; </p><p>THERE ARE TOO MANY INITIATIVES AND TOPICS; TOO MANY SMALL </p><p>COMPANY OWNERS USING IT TO DRUM UP BUSINESS.  THE USG\'S </p><p>PREFERENCE IS FOR A SMALLER TABD FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC ISSUES, </p><p>WITH PARTICIPATION BY MAJOR CEOS.  IT WOULD MEET ONLY IN </p><p>CAPITALS TO ENSURE HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATION.  THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF COMMERCE WILL HOST A DINNER FOR SUCH BUSINESS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>LEADERS ON JUNE 24.  RIES INVITED CANGELOSI TO NOMINATE </p><p>APPROPRIATE ITALIAN BUSINESS LEADERS TO PARTICIPATE. </p><p> </p><p>EU INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  CANGELOSI SAID THAT MODALITIES AND LOGISTICS FOR </p><p>THE EU AT 25 WOULD BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY. </p><p> ITALY WOULD WORK TO CONTROL THE NUMBER AND DURATION OF </p><p>INTERVENTIONS; HE LAMENTED THE COUNCIL\'S LOSS OF "INTIMACY" </p><p>AT 25.  CANGELOSI HOPED THAT THE IGC COULD START BY THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF OCTOBER, AND THAT IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE TO </p><p>COMPLETE DELIBERATIONS BY THE END OF THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY. </p><p>THIS WOULD ONLY BE POSSIBLE IF THE IGC LIMITED DISCUSSIONS TO </p><p>"OPEN ITEMS" UNRESOLVED BY THE CONVENTION.  THE PLAN THEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02299  03 OF 03  231112Z </p><p>WOULD BE TO FINALIZE THE DOCUMENT DURING THE IRISH </p><p>PRESIDENCY, AND SIGN THE AGREEMENT IN ROME AFTER THE FORMAL </p><p>ACCESSION OF NEW MEMBERS IN MAY; THE GOI ALSO WANTS ROMANIA, </p><p>BULGARIA AND TURKEY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS AS </p><p>OBSERVERS. </p><p>14.  (C)  CANGELOSI PREDICTED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE EU </p><p>COUNCIL PRESIDENCY WILL BE A COMPROMISE AGREED TO AT THE LAST </p><p>MINUTE.  IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SPECIFIC JOB </p><p>DESCRIPTION FOR THE COUNCIL PRESIDENT SO AS NOT TO INTERFERE </p><p>WITH COMMISSION FUNCTIONS.   A BALANCE ACCEPTABLE TO LARGE </p><p>AND SMALL MEMBER STATES COULD BE A COUNCIL PRESIDENT TERM OF </p><p>2 1/2 YEARS, WITH A REDUCED NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL COUNCILS </p><p>THAT WOULD ROTATE LEADERSHIP FROM WITHIN  CONSTITUENCIES </p><p>(NORDIC, SOUTHERN, ETC.) DURING THE PRESIDENCY TERM. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  RIES NOTED THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES OF SUCH A </p><p>SYSTEM, AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS. </p><p>EVERY TIME THE EU STREAMLINES, RIES NOTED, THERE ARE MORE </p><p>EUROPEANS ACROSS THE TABLE FROM AMERICANS.  CANGELOSI </p><p>PROMISED THAT THE NEW STRUCTURE WOULD SIMPLIFY TRANSATLANTIC </p><p>RELATIONS BECAUSE THE MAIN COUNCIL PRESIDENCY BUREAUCRACY </p><p>WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE FOR 2 1/2 YEARS.  RIES SAID THAT THE US </p><p>WOULD, OF COURSE, WORK WITH THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE THE </p><p>EU CHOSE FOR ITSELF.  HE UNDERLINED THE IMPORTANCE OF US-EU </p><p>COORDINATION "UPSTREAM," BEFORE POSITIONS HAD BEEN FORGED IN </p><p>BRUSSELS AND BECOME VIRTUALLY UNCHANGEABLE. </p><p> </p><p>16.
