After a four hour meeting past midnight on </p><p>The evening of February 14, the group returned to the </p><p>Presidential Villa on the morning of February 15 for several more hours of </p><p>talk.  Obasanjo convinced the MPCI leaders to accept the </p><p>spirit of the Marcoussis Accords and to rescind the rebels\' ultimatum </p><p>to the GOCI and allow diplomacy a chance to resolve the crisis. </p><p>(Full text of joint Obasanjo/Soro communique in para. 4.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ECOWAS ExecSec Mohammed Ibn Chambas called </p><p>Ambassador again on February 18 to provide a readout on the MPCI rebels\' </p><p>consultations in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso (an unscheduled </p><p>stop, according to Chambas; but Campaore was receptive to a </p><p>meeting which took place circa 11 PM).  Each of the </p><p>leaders, including Campaore, encouraged the rebels to show </p><p>flexibility and to work with ECOWAS in the spirit of the </p><p>Marcoussis Accord.  Specific allocation of portfolios was not </p><p>discussed, although the MPCI agreed to forego Defense and </p><p>Interior.  According to Chambas, the visit to Burkina Faso </p><p>Was hastily arranged on the invitation of President Campaore. </p><p>Chambas commented that this tour had raised the expectations in the </p><p>region.  After the Franco-African summit, he said, PM Diarra </p><p>would go to Bouke and seek a "peaceful and political" settlement.  It </p><p>was agreed that such a settlement should be achieved within a </p><p>week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  BEGIN TEXT OF ABUJA COMMUNIQUE: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic </p><p>Of Nigeria, His Excellency Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, on Sunday, </p><p>February 16, 2003, received a delegation of the Patriotic </p><p>Movement of Cote d\'Ivoire (MPCI) consisting of Guillaume Soro and </p><p>Sidiki Konate, leader and spokesman respectively of the MPCI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President Obasanjo urged all the sides to the on-going crisis </p><p>In Cote d\'Ivoire to continue to utilize dialogue and </p><p>negotiations to return the country to peace and stability.  He reiterated the </p><p>support of ECOWAS for the Marcoussis Accord and pledged that </p><p>the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as a member of the ECOWAS high </p><p>level contact group on Cote d\'Ivoire, would play an active role to </p><p>ensure its full implementation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In that regard, President Obasanjo called upon all Ivorians </p><p>To work together to bring peace to their country emphasizing </p><p>that no personalities or groups can be excluded from this process. </p><p>The President reminded Ivorians that the supreme interest of </p><p>Their country now called for an end to the war and for them to </p><p>embark on a process of national reconciliation, national unity and </p><p>national reconstruction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The leader of the MPCI, Mr. Soro, thanked President Obasanjo </p><p>For receiving the delegation.  He stated that the MPCI remained </p><p>committed to the full implementation of the Marcoussis </p><p>Accord.  He pledged the cooperation of the MPCI with ECOWAS and the </p><p>international community in the effort to find a solution to </p><p>the Ivorian crisis.  He expressed satisfaction that the Federal </p><p>Republic of Nigeria would continue to play a role in the </p><p>Search for durable peace and hoped that President Obasanjo would </p><p>Remain personally involved in the work of the ECOWAS Contact Group. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Based on the satisfactory talks the MPCI had with President </p><p>Obasanjo and Ghanain President John Kufuor, Chairman of </p><p>ECOWAS, Mr. Soro announced that the MPCI would suspend the ultimatum </p><p>It had issued to President Gbagbo to give diplomacy a change in </p><p>resolving the impasse over the partticipation of the MPCI in </p><p>government of national reconciliation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Soro expressed the hope that President Obasanjo and his </p><p>colleagues would intervene diplomatically to help the new </p><p>Prime Minister quickly form his government which would involve all </p><p>Ivorian political formations, including the MPCI as agreed </p><p>Under the Marcoussis Accord. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Earlier in Accra, the MPCI delegation had talks with Ghanaian </p><p>President, John Kufuor and Chairman of ECOWAS on the </p><p>Participation of their Movement in the government of National </p><p>Reconciliation to be formed by Prime Minister Seydou Diarra. </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
