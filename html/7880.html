<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000837 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  SECOND ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN INSURGENTS, </p><p>GOVERNMENT SCHEDULED AMID FUROR OVER USG TERRORISM WATCHLIST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0769 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0814 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The second round of talks between the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) and Maoist insurgents is scheduled to take place </p><p>on May 9 at an undisclosed location, according to local press </p><p>reports.  The initial round was held less than a week earlier </p><p>at a Kathmandu hotel (Ref A).  No agenda for the second round </p><p>has yet been made public. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The announcement of this next round follows </p><p>closely upon dire predictions by Maoist negotiators and even </p><p>some mainstream politicians that the USG decision to place </p><p>the Maoists on a watchlist in its annual terrorism report </p><p>could "derail" peace talks.  In a May 7 interview with a </p><p>left-wing vernacular newspaper, Maoist ideologue Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai described the listing as "an unsuccessful attempt </p><p>by the US to jeopardize talks. . . . and to establish a </p><p>military base in Nepal and fulfil its strategic interest in </p><p>South Asia."  In another interview in the Maoist publication </p><p>"Janadesh," Bhattarai charged, "The action increases the </p><p>chances of turning the country into a battlefield by turning </p><p>China and India against each other.  There is no doubt that </p><p>the action will have a serious and far-reaching effect on the </p><p>sovereignty and independence of the country. . . . .The </p><p>declaration is . . . a big conspiracy against Nepali </p><p>nationalism and Nepali people."  At a rally in Kathmandu on </p><p>May 4 (Ref B), Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (UML) General Secretary Madhav Nepal warned that the </p><p>USG action "could disrupt the peace process."  In a televised </p><p>interview that aired on May 5, Ambassador Malinowski </p><p>clarified the significance of the listing, noting that the </p><p>Maoists\' actions against US interests had landed them on the </p><p>watchlist (septel).  He noted that, contrary to widespread </p><p>speculation, the release of the report was not/not </p><p>intentionally timed to coincide with the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The expatriate head of an NGO called poloff May 4 to </p><p>communicate Bhattarai\'s dismay at the listing.  Bhattarai </p><p>reportedly had said that the Maoists had declared a ceasefire </p><p>and come to the negotiating table "in good faith" to try for </p><p>a peaceful settlement.  The Maoists were thus "genuinely </p><p>mystified" by the listing, and wondered if they were supposed </p><p>to be "negotiating with Kathmandu or Washington."  The NGO </p><p>head indicated the Maoists might be interested in resuming </p><p>dialogue with an Embassy representative to clarify matters. </p><p>Poloff declined, replying that matters were likely clear </p><p>enough already to the Maoists, i.e., that their own actions </p><p>against US employees and interests had earned them the </p><p>listing. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  The Maoists are clearly dismayed by the </p><p>listing, which they fear may impede the charm offensive they </p><p>have launched with the diplomatic community, members of civil </p><p>society, and the local intelligentsia since coming above </p><p>ground on March 28.  We will continue to convey the message, </p><p>both publicly and privately, that the listing took place </p><p>because of Maoist actions against the USG, that our decision </p><p>was made independently of Maoist actions against the GON and </p><p>the GON decision to stop characterizing them as terrorists, </p><p>and that the listing cannot thus be misconstrued as "internal </p><p>interference."  Maoist rhetoric aside, we are encouraged that </p><p>the two sides have agreed to a second round of talks.  This </p><p>decision strengthens our perception that the US\' firm </p><p>opposition Maoist violence is a major consideration in their </p><p>pursuit of a political settlement. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
