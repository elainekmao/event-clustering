(SBU)  Summary:  New Chairman of the GVN Committee on </p><p>Religious Affairs (CRA) Ngo Yen Thi told Ambassador on May </p><p>28 that CPV Central Committee Resolution Seven on religion </p><p>is the most important issue currently for the CRA.  His </p><p>overall goal as head of the CRA, in light of the Resolution, </p><p>is to narrow the gap between believers and non-believers </p><p>that had stemmed from historical conflicts.  He explained </p><p>that Resolution Seven is designed to grant and protect </p><p>rights for religious activities, define relations with </p><p>religious groups, and create unity between religious </p><p>believers and non-believers.  Chairman Thi blamed forced </p><p>conversions on the failure of local cadres to understand </p><p>national policy, and said that one purpose of Resolution </p><p>Seven is to correct such failures of understanding and </p><p>publicly to confirm religion as a spiritual need of </p><p>citizens.  Chairman Thi and Ambassador also discussed United </p><p>Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) leaders Thich Huyen Quang </p><p>and Thich Quang Do, Protestants in the Central and Northwest </p><p>Highlands, and the two GVN-recognized Protestant church </p><p>organizations.  Chairman Thi came across as a well-informed, </p><p>open, and willing interlocutor.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Chairman Thi held his "first meeting with </p><p>foreigners as CRA chairman" with Ambassador and DCM in </p><p>response to Embassy\'s request to meet with the CRA to </p><p>discuss religious freedom issues raised in ref b.  (Note: </p><p>Former CRA Chairman Vinh retired in early May, but it was </p><p>unclear until May 27 whether Vinh or Thi would receive </p><p>Ambassador.  End note.)  Ambassador asked Chairman Thi to </p><p>outline his ideas for his new job, especially in light of </p><p>CPV Central Committee Resolution Seven (ref a).  He also </p><p>asked Chairman Thi to explain what changes were underway </p><p>with respect to Thich Huyen Quang and the UBCV. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CPV Resolution Seven </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Resolution Seven is currently the most important </p><p>issue for the CRA, according to Chairman Thi.  He said that, </p><p>according to some (unnamed) "Western observers," the </p><p>Resolution will pave the way for freer religious activities, </p><p>while other Westerners say that it will limit and bind </p><p>activities more closely than in the past.  He confirmed that </p><p>the Resolution reaffirms longstanding CPV/GVN policy of </p><p>respecting and guaranteeing religious freedom.  However, he </p><p>admitted that there were problems implementing the policy </p><p>and that "not everyone" understands it.  While recognized </p><p>religions operate within the law, some individuals belonging </p><p>to those faiths and other religions not recognized by the </p><p>GVN have "violated the law."  Therefore, the CPV designed </p><p>Resolution Seven step by step to "grant rights to carry out </p><p>activities within the law;" to create "normal" relations </p><p>between religions and the government, between different </p><p>religions, and between religions and other social </p><p>organizations.  It is also designed publicly to confirm that </p><p>religion is a spiritual need of citizens and to give credit </p><p>for the contributions towards national construction of </p><p>religions in close relationships with the GVN.  Finally, he </p><p>said it reaffirms the GVN\'s respect for religions and </p><p>guarantees the right of religious belief and "normal" </p><p>religious activities. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The GVN is organizing many classes to ensure that </p><p>local officials have a uniform understanding of Resolution </p><p>Seven and national policy, Chairman Thi asserted.  It is </p><p>necessary that those who decide religious issues have a firm </p><p>understanding of religious matters.  He expressed hope that </p><p>through efforts such as educating local officials, the GVN </p><p>could create an environment fostering normal religious </p><p>activities.  This would, he predicted, help overcome </p><p>Vietnam\'s image problem overseas. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Leadership and Religion </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  In response to Ambassador\'s question about the </p><p>absence of religious believers from the ranks of the CPV, </p><p>Chairman Thi asserted that there are religious believers -- </p><p>including Cao Dai, Catholic, and Protestant as well as </p><p>Buddhist -- in the CPV.  Furthermore, they are permitted to </p><p>carry out their Party and their religious duties without </p><p>conflict and could hold positions at the commune and </p><p>district levels.  He admitted that it is "easier" for </p><p>Buddhists in the CPV, although he clarified that many of </p><p>them are not "students" of the religion, but relatively </p><p>casual "followers."  He emphasized that Vietnam\'s many wars </p><p>had opened rifts between various religious believers and </p><p>other parts of the population, but that authorities are </p><p>working on closing those rifts.  He added that old </p><p>viewpoints on religion would change and that </p><p>misunderstandings of religion would be reduced greatly. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Referring primarily to religious leaders rather </p><p>than followers, Chairman Thi pointed out that the National </p><p>Assembly contains religious "believers," but suggested that </p><p>it would be difficult for religious persons to balance their </p><p>religious and professional obligations and thus serve in </p><p>higher positions in the GVN.  He refused to speculate on </p><p>whether persons of religion would be able to rise to senior </p><p>leadership positions in the future. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang\'s Situation </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Chairman Thi attributed part of the improvement in </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang\'s status to the consequences of Resolution </p><p>Seven, but also credited a change in the UBCV Patriarch\'s </p><p>thinking.  He claimed that the UBCV Patriarch had formed two </p><p>favorable impressions of the GVN while visiting Hanoi (ref </p><p>c).  One was that the GVN has been working hard to build the </p><p>nation and improved the lives of the people.  The second was </p><p>that after visiting several Hanoi pagodas and talking to </p><p>local monks, Thich Huyen Quang had observed that religious </p><p>activities were "normal" in the North.  Subsequently, Thich </p><p>Huyen Quang reportedly expressed these points during his </p><p>meeting with the Prime Minister (ref d), which Chairman Thi </p><p>said he had attended. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Chairman Thi noted that Thich Huyen Quang had been </p><p>administratively detained in Quang Ngai for "a long time" as </p><p>a result of actions taken by Ho Chi Minh City authorities. </p><p>(Note:  He did not explain why Ho Chi Minh City authorities </p><p>were able to have the UBCV leader detained in another </p><p>province.  End note.)  However, that detention had expired </p><p>in 1997, according to Thi.  Ambassador pointed out that </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang has complained that he has never received </p><p>a written explanation of why he was confined, what the </p><p>duration of his detention was, or that it had ended.  Thi </p><p>expressed surprise at this, saying that the section that had </p><p>initiated the detention had decided to end it in 1997, but </p><p>that Thich Huyen Quang had been too much of a stickler and </p><p>not accepted the decision. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Ambassador asked about Thich Huyen Quang\'s current </p><p>legal status.  Chairman Thi noted that the UBCV leader had </p><p>returned to Quang Ngai after his visit to Ho Chi Minh City, </p><p>but was also spending time in Binh Dinh province where his </p><p>original monastery is located.  He claimed that the UBCV </p><p>Patriarch wants to devote most of his time to running this </p><p>monastery and that Binh Dinh authorities would "create </p><p>favorable conditions" for this. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Chairman Thi said that he was sure that Thich </p><p>Quang Do\'s administrative detention would be ending soon, </p><p>thanks to the GVN\'s clemency policy.  He confirmed that </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang had asked the Prime Minister about Thich </p><p>Quang Do. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Highlands Protestants </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Ambassador reminded Chairman Thi that Americans </p><p>and Europeans pay considerable attention to the problems of </p><p>Protestants in the Central and Northwest Highlands and that </p><p>he personally has made trips to those regions and met with </p><p>local officials and believers.  He acknowledged that there </p><p>is a history of separatist activities associated with some </p><p>Protestants.  Provincial leaders had told the Ambassador </p><p>that local officials sometimes do not separatists from the </p><p>peaceful majority of Protestant believers.  Ambassador noted </p><p>the negative attitude and lack of knowledge of local </p><p>officials such as the Kon Tum Deputy Chief of Religious </p><p>Affairs who had denied that the SECV was legal, and the </p><p>provincial leader who had asserted to Ambassador that </p><p>minorities who became Protestants were "traitors" to their </p><p>people.  Moreover, while not all reports of church closings </p><p>and forced renunciations were believable, they are </p><p>sufficiently numerous to indicate that such things must be </p><p>happening, Ambassador told Chairman Thi.  While there were </p><p>generally reasonable explanations for and expectations of </p><p>resolving other religious freedom problems, Ambassador told </p><p>Chairman Thi that there was no excuse for those suffered by </p><p>Protestants in the Highlands.  He asked about the status of </p><p>efforts by the SECV and ECVN to enroll highlands </p><p>congregations in their ranks. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Chairman Thi claimed that such actions by local </p><p>authorities were not in accord with national policy.  He </p><p>said that he had visited the Central Highlands and found the </p><p>issue "very difficult."  Forced conversions happen because </p><p>local cadres "do not understand" national policy.  He </p><p>reiterated that Resolution Seven is partially intended to </p><p>correct this problem.  He added that the GVN is considering </p><p>special programs to benefit Protestants.  Part of the </p><p>complication, he asserted, is that the Dega Protestants have </p><p>a clear political agenda -- inherent in the term Dega, "de" </p><p>referring to the Ede people and "ga" meaning "state" in the </p><p>local language.  Ambassador replied that the Dega are a </p><p>minority and that the U.S. has repeatedly and publicly </p><p>affirmed that it does not support groups seeking to divide </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Another complication, according to Chairman Thi, </p><p>is that the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) </p><p>accepted local congregations in the Central Highlands </p><p>without "consulting" with the local authorities.  Therefore, </p><p>local authorities have not known which congregations are </p><p>SECV and which are not.  (Note:  Mission sources have </p><p>reported that the SECV submitted incomplete lists of its </p><p>historical Central Highlands congregations when it </p><p>registered with the GVN in 2001.  Some allege that the SECV </p><p>was pressured to do so.  End note.)  He claimed that this is </p><p>what the Kon Tum official must have been referring to when </p><p>he said that the SECV was not legal.  Ambassador replied </p><p>that regardless of this confusion, it is time to regularize </p><p>the status of these congregations. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Chairman Thi went on to say that some local </p><p>authorities had told him that "every" Protestant was Dega. </p><p>He said that the CRA was trying to overcome this and had </p><p>requested local authorities to work closely with the SECV to </p><p>determine which congregations belonged to the recognized </p><p>church.  Chairman Thi advocated "expedited communications" </p><p>between the SECV and local authorities.  House churches made </p><p>up of "pure religious followers" could be re-established in </p><p>affiliation with the SECV.  However, there would be no </p><p>recognition of Dega groups, he warned.  He promised that the </p><p>GVN would gradually create "normal conditions" for </p><p>Protestant believers, but time was needed to close gaps </p><p>caused by past misunderstandings.  He termed these efforts </p><p>the GVN\'s "peaceful evolution" campaign. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>The ECVN and Northwest Highlands churches </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  Chairman Thi described the ECVN\'s leadership as </p><p>moribund and disunited.  Thus, enrollment of congregations </p><p>in the Northwest Highlands could not be taken as </p><p>representative of the will of the ECVN.  He claimed that the </p><p>GVN was taking steps to encourage and strengthen the ECVN\'s </p><p>executive board and to organize the long-delayed ECVN </p><p>convention.  If the ECVN "followed instructions," Chairman </p><p>Thi said that the convention could be held before the end of </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Laws on Religion </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU)  Ambassador asked Chairman Thi if the GVN was </p><p>considering the USG suggestion to investigate and openly </p><p>punish officials who had violated the religious rights of </p><p>citizens.  Chairman Thi responded that the suggestion is </p><p>under consideration, but that it is difficult to implement. </p><p>There is no separate code on religion and while there are </p><p>other legal provisions that might apply, they are not </p><p>complete.  He mentioned that the new ordinance on religion </p><p>is still under consideration by the National Assembly </p><p>Standing Committee.  He added that the GVN is now </p><p>considering a separate code to define penalties for </p><p>individuals who have violated GVN religion policy, including </p><p>cadres who had committed wrongdoing.  (Note:  Several months </p><p>ago CRA officials indicated that such penalties would be </p><p>included in the religion ordinance.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU)  Ambassador expressed concern that this code </p><p>could outlaw  proselytizing.  Chairman Thi replied that </p><p>proselytizing by recognized groups was permitted, but that </p><p>it was illegal for unrecognized groups to do so.  Ambassador </p><p>noted that had this law been in effect at the time, it would </p><p>have outlawed the creation of the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai. </p><p>Chairman Thi clarified that such groups could register and </p><p>then be permitted to proselytize.  The point, he explained, </p><p>was to prevent the establishment of religions that advocated </p><p>undesirable behavior. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Biographical Note </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU)  Ngo Yen Thi has been with the Committee on </p><p>Religious Affairs for about two years, and was principal </p><p>Deputy Chairman for over a year before becoming Chairman </p><p>(although not known to Embassy).  He said that he had worked </p><p>his way up through local and provincial level posts before </p><p>coming to Hanoi.  He is from central Vietnam and immediately </p><p>prior to joining the CRA was Thua Thien Hue province CPV </p><p>Chairman and the provincial People\'s Council (provincial </p><p>assembly) Chairman.  He was a member of the CPV Central </p><p>Committee from 1996 to 2001 and of the National Assembly </p><p>from 1997 to 2002.  He was born in 1945.  A staffer in the </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs International Organizations </p><p>Department described him as being "quite capable." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU)  Chairman Thi is an open and well-informed </p><p>interlocutor who responded to most issues directly and </p><p>forthrightly.  His answers about the Central Highlands are </p><p>welcome -- he essentially acknowledged that forced </p><p>renunciations and house church closings have occurred and </p><p>claimed that the GVN is attempting to correct the situation. </p><p>Chairman Thi\'s explanation of Resolution Seven reinforces </p><p>our conclusion that the CPV and GVN intend to attempt to </p><p>regulate religion more closely while "normalizing" or </p><p>legitimizing its role in society.  His stated intention to </p><p>close the gaps between religious believers and others sounds </p><p>benevolent, but also raises the possibility of strict action </p><p>against unregistered groups. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
