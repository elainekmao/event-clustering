<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 005285 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p>PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: DECL:  12/4/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, GCC, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: A "FATIGUED" KING FAHD STILL OUT </p><p>          OF PUBLIC VIEW; CROWN PRINCE ATTENDS GCC SUMMIT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. RIYADH 5250 AND PREVIOUS, B. DOHA 2698 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1. CLASSIFIED BY DCM THEODORE KATTOUF - 1.5 B,D. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ACCORDING TO PRINCE BANDAR BIN SULTAN, KING </p><p>FAHD IS EXPECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE RECOVERY FROM THE </p><p>MILD STROKE HE SUFFERED NOVEMBER 30.  HOSPITAL SOURCES </p><p>REPORT THE KING IS ANTICIPATED TO CHECK OUT FROM THE </p><p>HOSPITAL ON DECEMBER 7.  A ROYAL COURT STATEMENT, ISSUED </p><p>ON DECEMBER 3, ATTRIBUTED THE KING\'S HOSPITAL ADMITTANCE </p><p>TO WORK RELATED FATIGUE, BUT ADMITTED TO THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>A SPECIAL TEAM OF AMERICAN MEDICAL EXPERTS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE PUBLIC BAROMETER OF THE KING\'S HEALTH IS WHETHER AND </p><p>WHEN HE APPEARS ON TELEVISION.  THIS APPEARANCE, </p><p>PREDICTED BY MINDEF SULTAN TO OCCUR ON DECEMBER 3, DID </p><p>NOT TAKE PLACE.  CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH IS ATTENDING THE </p><p>GCC SUMMIT IN THE KING\'S STEAD BUT, GIVEN THE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS ATTENDANCE, IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO </p><p>ADVANCE ANY SIGNIFICANT INITIATIVES.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>ROYAL COURT ATTRIBUTES COLLAPSE TO FATIGUE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  A STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE ROYAL COURT, MID-DAY </p><p>DECEMBER 3, QUOTES AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE KING FAYSAL </p><p>SPECIALIST HOSPITAL THAT KING FAHD\'S HEALTH IS </p><p>"REASSURING AND DOES NOT CALL FOR CONCERN."  THE </p><p>HOSPITAL RELEASE ATTRIBUTED THE "SUDDEN HEALTH PROBLEM" </p><p>WHICH AFFLICTED THE KING TO THE "PRESSURES OF WORK AND </p><p>TO ENSUING FATIGUE."  CONSEQUENTLY, THE DOCTORS, </p><p>INCLUDING A MEDICAL TEAM FLOWN IN FROM THE U.S. TO </p><p>PERFORM ADDITIONAL TESTS, HAVE PRESCRIBED "REST AND </p><p>RECUPERATION." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  WHILE OBSCURING THE FACT THAT THE KING SUFFERED </p><p>FROM A TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK OR A MILD STROKE, THE </p><p>ROYAL COURT\'S STATEMENT IS DISTINGUISHED BY THE CANDOR </p><p>IN WHICH IT ADMITS THE ARRIVAL OF A TEAM OF AMERICAN </p><p>MEDICAL EXPERTS.  THE SAUDI PUBLIC, TAKING NOTE OF THE </p><p>DELUGE OF CABLES FROM WORLD LEADERS WISHING THE KING </p><p>GOOD HEALTH AND THE ADMISSION THAT FOREIGN EXPERTS WERE </p><p>CONSULTED, ARE AWARE THAT THE KING WAS ADMITTED FOR </p><p>SOMETHING OTHER THAN "ROUTINE MEDICAL EXAMS."  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE THREE STATEMENTS ISSUED TO DATE BY THE ROYAL COURT </p><p>HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN SILENCING MORE DIRE SPECULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PRINCE BANDAR ON UNCLE\'S RECOVERY </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  IN A LATE EVENING DISCUSSION ON DECEMBER 2, </p><p>PRINCE BANDAR BIN SULTAN (WHO ACCOMPANIED THE AMERICAN </p><p>MEDICAL TEAM TO RIYADH) ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT KING </p><p>FAHD WOULD MAKE A COMPLETE RECOVERY.  HE PREDICTED THAT </p><p>THE KING WOULD REMAIN IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 5-10 DAYS. </p><p>THE MEDICAL TEAM WAS TO DECIDE ON A COURSE OF TREATMENT </p><p>FOR THE KING ON DECEMBER 3.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE KING </p><p>IS SITTING UP, EATING, AND CONVERSING WITH FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS.  ("AL HAYAT" ON DECEMBER 4 REPORTED THAT THE </p><p>KING HELD A DINNER MEETING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS ON </p><p>DECEMBER 3.)  THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT TO THE KING\'S </p><p>RECUPERATION, ACCORDING TO BANDAR, ARE THE THRONG OF </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS HOVERING IN AND AROUND THE KING\'S SUITE. </p><p>BANDAR BLAMED THE KING, WHO PERIODICALLY ASKS WHERE A </p><p>PARTICULAR MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IS, FOR EXACERBATING THE </p><p>THE AL SAUD\'S INSTINCT TO GATHER ROUND IN TIMES OF </p><p>FAMILY CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>KING\'S HEALTH: DELAYED TV APPEARANCE, CHECK-OUT DATE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  CONFUSION AS TO WHEN THE KING WILL APPEAR ON </p><p>TELEVISION TO DEMONSTRATE HIS RECOVERY HAS RESULTED IN </p><p>AMBIGUITY REGARDING HIS REAL HEALTH STATUS.  ON DECEMBER </p><p>3, MINDEF SULTAN TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE HAD MOVED </p><p>UP HIS APPOINTMENT FROM 1330 TO 1100 IN ORDER TO BE ON </p><p>HAND FOR A TELEVISION CREW\'S FILMING OF THE KING FOR THE </p><p>BROADCAST THAT NIGHT.  NO SUCH BROADCAST OCCURRED. </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD AL FAYSAL WAS QUOTED IN THE </p><p>DECEMBER 4 "AL HAYAT" AS SAYING THAT KING FAHD WOULD </p><p>APPEAR ON TELEVISION TO DISCUSS HIS HEALTH WITH THE </p><p>SAUDI PEOPLE.  CLEARLY, THE TELEVISION APPEARANCE HAS </p><p>BECOME A DE FACTO BAROMETER OF THE KING\'S TRUE STANDING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THERE IS NO INFORMATION EMANATING FROM CONTACTS </p><p>AT THE KING FAYSAL HOSPITAL TO SUGGEST THAT THE KING IS </p><p>"COUNTING HIS LAST HOURS" (REFTEL B).  TO THE CONTRARY, </p><p>THE KING REPORTEDLY IS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL </p><p>THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7.  THE DCM, WHO WAS AT THE HOSPITAL </p><p>ON DECEMBER 4, SAW NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY.  ONE DOCTOR, WHO </p><p>IS NOT ON FAHD\'S MEDICAL TEAM, CLAIMED THE KING WAS </p><p>"DOING FINE."  THE DELAY IN THE TELEVISION APPEARANCE </p><p>MAY BE A FUNCTION OF RECTIFYING THE IMAGE OF A FATIGUED </p><p>MONARCH.  ACCORDING TO ONE HOSPITAL SOURCE, WHEN THE </p><p>KING ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL HE WAS SUFFERING PARALYSIS </p><p>TO THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE; ALTHOUGH THE CONDITION </p><p>QUICKLY PASSED, THERE MAY BE SOME RESIDUAL SAGGING OF </p><p>THE FACIAL MUSCLES.  THE FACT THAT THE KING\'S PRIVATE </p><p>SECRETARY LEVELLED WITH THE AMBASSADOR AS TO THE KING\'S </p><p>HEALTH STATUS ON THE DAY OF HIS ADMITTANCE TO THE </p><p>HOSPITAL, POST IS CONFIDENT ANY DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE </p><p>KING\'S HEALTH WOULD BE REVEALED TO US. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT: GCC SUMMIT ON BACK BURNER </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  AS NOTED BY THE DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL GUARD, ABD AL-AZIZ AL-TUWAIJRI, ON DECEMBER 2, </p><p>THE CROWN PRINCE WAS DISPATCHED TO MUSCAT TO ATTEND THE </p><p>GCC SUMMIT IN KING FAHD\'S STEAD.  GIVEN THE KING\'S </p><p>PRE-STROKE RELUCTANCE TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE, </p><p>PURPORTEDLY OUT OF PIQUE OVER HIS FAILED INITIATIVE TO </p><p>SPEARHEAD THE RESOLUTION OF INTRA-GCC BORDER DISPUTES, </p><p>WE PRESUME THAT SAG ENGAGEMENT AT THE CONFERENCE WILL BE </p><p>PERFUNCTORY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MABUS </p><p></p></div>
