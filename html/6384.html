<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000678 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, GT, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALAN RESPONSE TO 59TH UNHRC DEMARCHE: </p><p>POSITIONS MAY CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS YEARS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 64728 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Robert E. Copley for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  In response to reftel points, MFA </p><p>Multilateral Affairs Director Castillo told us Guatemalan </p><p>positions at the UNHRC this year might differ from previous </p><p>years.  On Cuba, Castillo repeated that President Portillo </p><p>would ultimately decide how the GOG will vote, but said the </p><p>decision would take into account improved GOG relations with </p><p>Cuba and recent U.S. decertification of Guatemala.  On Iraq, </p><p>Castillo said Guatemala is highly vulnerable to oil shocks </p><p>and although the GOG understands that a peaceful solution may </p><p>not be possible, it fears the negative repercussions of </p><p>military action.  On Middle East resolutions, Castillo said </p><p>the GOG was concerned about perceptions from past UNHRC </p><p>sessions that it is anti-Arab, and said votes at this session </p><p>would be more "balanced."  Foreign Minister Gutierrez will </p><p>travel to Geneva after visiting Washington on Monday March </p><p>17.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Polcouns and Poloff discussed U.S. priorities for the </p><p>upcoming UN Human Rights Commission with Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Relations Director General for Multilateral Affairs, </p><p>Ambassador Giovanni Castillo on February 13.  Castillo said </p><p>that the GOG shares the priority the USG places on human </p><p>rights and agrees with many of our priorities at the UNHRC. </p><p>He added that when we must disagree, we do so as friends.  He </p><p>used this opening to point out that we may find less </p><p>agreement this year on Cuba, Iraq, and the Middle East </p><p>resolutions.  Castillo expressed appreciation for information </p><p>on our positions but stated frankly that Guatemala did not </p><p>have the personnel resources to focus on all the issues, </p><p>citing the Zimbabwe resolution as an example. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On Cuba, Castillo said the GOG has not yet decided on </p><p>its position, which will be determined by President Portillo </p><p>himself.  Castillo pointed out that GOG cooperation with Cuba </p><p>has improved markedly in recent months.  He mentioned the </p><p>Vice President\'s recent trip to the Island, the </p><p>just-concluded Ministerial with Cuban Foreign Minster Perez </p><p>Roque, and said that Portillo had received an invitation to </p><p>visit Cuba.  Castillo stated that these closer ties with Cuba </p><p>were bound to have an impact on the President\'s decision, and </p><p>added that the USG decision to decertify Guatemala on </p><p>narcotics cooperation may also be a factor in the decision. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On Iraq, Castillo said Guatemala hoped for a peaceful </p><p>resolution, though he said this did not mean the GOG would </p><p>oppose a military solution.  He stressed that Guatemala </p><p>understood that military action might be inevitable, and </p><p>commented that the GOG is concerned about the possible </p><p>economic impact of hostilities on Guatemala.  Castillo said </p><p>Guatemala is vulnerable to oil shocks and was already feeling </p><p>the strain of higher prices. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) On the Middle East resolutions, Castillo said the </p><p>GOG\'s position is evolving.  He stated that the GOG was </p><p>increasingly worried about the perception that Guatemala is </p><p>anti-Arab and blindly supports Israel.  Castillo said that </p><p>Arab delegations at the NAM summit in Malaysia had exerted </p><p>enormous pressure on the GOG representative to that meeting, </p><p>and that the Guatemalan delegation had returned concerned </p><p>that Guatemala is overly exposed on these issues.  Castillo </p><p>hastened to add that the Ministry had been analyzing its </p><p>votes at the 58th UNHRC for some time.  Castillo said that </p><p>Guatemala had paid a high price for some of its earlier </p><p>votes, and that its votes in the upcoming UNHRC would be more </p><p>"balanced."  Polcouns commented that Guatemala\'s record at </p><p>the last UNHRC had been very positive, and had been noticed </p><p>by many in Washington as forward leaning on promoting human </p><p>rights in Cuba and the Middle East.  This had earned the GOG </p><p>significant recognition in Washington, and we hoped that the </p><p>GOG could preserve that balance. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Castillo identified North Korea as the issue where </p><p>our interest most fully overlap.  Pressed for other issues of </p><p>interest to Guatemala at the UNHRC, Castillo said that three </p><p>reports related to Guatemala are scheduled to be presented </p><p>and added that the rights of indigenous peoples and migrants </p><p>are of perennial interest to Guatemala.  Castillo informed us </p><p>that Foreign Minister Gutierrez would be traveling to Geneva </p><p>for the opening week of the UNHRC.  He also noted that the </p><p>new GOG Ambassador Ricardo Alvarado would represent Guatemala </p><p>at this session.  Castillo indicated that President Portillo </p><p>trusted Ambassador Alvarado fully, and Alvarado would have </p><p>significant discretion on many of the votes.  He indicated </p><p>that on the more important votes (e.g. Cuba, Middle East, </p><p>Iraq), President Portillo was likely to make the decisions </p><p>himself, in consultation with Foreign Minister Gutierrez, UN </p><p>Permrep Rosenthal and Ambassador Alvarado. </p><p>7.  (C) Comment:  The decision on the Cuba vote will probably </p><p>be made at the very last minute by President Portillo </p><p>himself, and it is too soon to predict what factors will </p><p>ultimately influence that vote (the Ambassador has engaged </p><p>the Foreign Minister repeatedly on Cuba, most recently at the </p><p>CICIACS human rights announcement on March 13).  Guatemala\'s </p><p>shift away from solid support for Israel may well be </p><p>influenced by new Foreign Minister Gutierrez\'s </p><p>pro-Palestinian sympathies.  In the past Guatemala\'s votes </p><p>for Israel have not been driven by requests from us, but </p><p>rather were related to Israel\'s influence with the GOG.  We </p><p>will engage the Israeli Embassy in Guatemala to seek a common </p><p>strategy for retaining GOG support for responsible votes on </p><p>the Middle East, and would welcome the engagement of others </p><p>to shore up Guatemala\'s traditional support for our positions </p><p>on resolutions involving the Middle East. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
