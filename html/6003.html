(SBU) Summary: With Turkey\'s new AK government just </p><p>having marked its hundredth day in office, representatives of </p><p>American pharmaceutical companies indicate they have not yet </p><p>judged the time ripe to raise the intellectual property and </p><p>pricing issues that have beset them in recent years.  Despite </p><p>this, they see some grounds for hope.  Eli Lilly Managing </p><p>Director Roberto Giusti argues that in contrast to its more </p><p>"nationalistic" predecessor, the current government\'s </p><p>intentions are good, though it has little concept of the </p><p>scale of the issues confronting it in the pharmaceutical </p><p>area.  Giusti argued that advancement of U.S. pharmaceutical </p><p>interests remains hampered by continued divisions within the </p><p>industry.  Differences over the relative weight accorded to </p><p>such issues as prolonging the reimbursement lifecycle of </p><p>older off-patent brands has divided such industry leaders as </p><p>Eli Lilly and Pfizer, with the former joining with </p><p>like-minded companies to form a new "Association of Research </p><p>Based Pharmaceutical Companies" (AIFD) in January.  Now </p><p>completing its registration procedures, the group will make </p><p>an introductory foray into Ankara later this week. </p><p>Meanwhile, Giusti encouraged the USG to continue to host </p><p>regular gatherings of the industry, noting that outside these </p><p>sessions "there is very little dialogue."  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A New Association: In a February 27 meeting with </p><p>P/E Chief and Commercial Specialist, Eli Lilly General </p><p>Manager Roberto Giusti (joined midway through the meeting by </p><p>Akzo Nobel General Manager Edward Lysen) outlined the goals </p><p>of the new research-based association (of which he is Vice </p><p>President).  (Note: The Group\'s ten members make up 20 </p><p>percent of the sector, accounting for a significant 190 </p><p>million USD in investment in Turkey in the past two years. </p><p>End Note.) They stressed that neither IEIS (the Drug </p><p>Manufacturers Employers\' Association) nor TISD (the Turkish </p><p>Drug Manufacturers\' Association) makes representation of </p><p>innovation or of research-based interests their top priority, </p><p>and that AIFD aims to fill that gap.  Pointing to "big </p><p>picture" in Turkish healthcare expenditure, Giusti argued </p><p>that while the total is deficient (closer to that of Bulgaria </p><p>than that of Greece), it is also seriously skewed.  Much of </p><p>it, he suggested, is a "subsidy" to domestic industry, in </p><p>that while imported drugs routinely face price </p><p>discrimination, Turkish manufacturers receive reimbursement </p><p>far above comparable world prices for their "copy drugs" (or </p><p>generics).  As a result, cost containment (encouraged by the </p><p>IMF) has targeted new and innovative products, resulting in </p><p>price discrimination against them.  (Thus, vitamins, e.g., </p><p>are subsidized, while new cancer drugs are not.)  Giusti </p><p>stressed that the new association is not overtly seeking an </p><p>end to the subsidies, nor to the reimbursement lifecycle </p><p>issues on which he suggested Pfizer is focused.  Rather the </p><p>group believes these "business interests" should be lower </p><p>priorities than the industry\'s "legitimate entitlements": </p><p>full implementation of intellectual property rights and the </p><p>discontinuation of disciminatory practices against imports. </p><p>In Giusti\'s view, the defensibility of the "local subsidy" or </p><p>reimbursement lifecycle is not the key issue; rather the </p><p>issue is their "inappropriateness" at a time when data </p><p>exclusivity is not provided and when price discrimination </p><p>continues to exist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Continued Differences: Giusti noted that the </p><p>association\'s members are not exclusively foreign, but </p><p>include three Turkish research-based firms.  Founding </p><p>companies include Novartis, Sering AG, Novo, Bayer, Solvay, </p><p>Lundbeck Astrazeneca, Sanofi-Synthelabo, Organon and Lilly. </p><p>Outside the new organization are those with "other </p><p>interests": generic manufacturers, with their vested interest </p><p>in the current reimbursement system, and Pfizer.  (In a </p><p>separate meeting with Pfizer\'s Pricing Director Feyza Tevruz </p><p>earlier in the month, these differences were only indirectly </p><p>touched upon, with Tevruz noting that Pfizer did not share </p><p>all of Giusti\'s criticism of the reimbursement system: while </p><p>it agreed the system was "not perfect," it could live with </p><p>it.)  Giusti also expressed frustration with the lack of </p><p>transparency in the GOT\'s reimbursement decisions, suggesting </p><p>that some other foreign firms had benefited from their access </p><p>to decisionmakers to win special breaks.  Part of the </p><p>problem, he suggested, is a lack of communication within the </p><p>industry, and he encouraged the USG to hold pharmaceutical </p><p>roundtables (like that of late November at the Consulate) on </p><p>a more regular basis.  Lysen echoed the point, noting that in </p><p>his past assignment, roundtables hosted by Embassy Tokyo had </p><p>been extremely helpful in keeping the industry informed about </p><p>developments and on the same page in their advocacy efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Still too Early: Giusti and Lysen echoed what Tevruz </p><p>and Pharmacia-Upjohn Country Director Muhittin Bilutay </p><p>suggested earlier in the month: the time is only now becoming </p><p>ripe to press the new Minister of Health on the data </p><p>exclusivity and price discrimination issues, particularly </p><p>given staff changes in the Ministry.  Giusti was hopeful that </p><p>the new government would be more open to the industry\'s </p><p>position than its predecessor.  The Ecevit government, he </p><p>argued, saw issues through a "nationalistic" prism and was </p><p>predisposed to back domestic industry at the expense of its </p><p>foreign counterparts.  That may not be true of AK: he </p><p>suggested that the government\'s intentions are "good," but </p><p>that it is not aware of the extent of things that need to be </p><p>changed.  Giusti said he will make an initial trip to Ankara </p><p>this week to introduce the new association and distribute the </p><p>new issue paper it has prepared (copy e-mailed to desk and </p><p>Embassy Ankara).  Bilgutay similarly indicated that the </p><p>industry is just now beginning to raise the price issues that </p><p>have seriously harmed it in Ankara.  The Import subcommittee </p><p>of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA) planned </p><p>to meet with the Health Ministry\'s new Director General of </p><p>Pharmaceuticals in mid-February to raise its concerns about </p><p>import pricing, and to determine whether she planned to </p><p>adhere to the action plan her predecessor had adopted to </p><p>address the issue.  Bilgutay stressed the seriousness of the </p><p>situation, noting that regulations that had cut the companies </p><p>margins on imports from 36 to 16 percent (10 percent profit </p><p>and 6 percent cost), when coupled with inflation and lags in </p><p>reimbursement cycles, had seriously harmed the industry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) A Tender Trap?: Bilgutey also flagged his concern </p><p>that new tender regulations may apply to purchase of </p><p>pharmaceutical products, putting further downward pressure on </p><p>already low reimbursement prices.  Neither Giusti or Tevruz </p><p>raised this issue, however. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: Serious divisions persist among U.S. and </p><p>other international companies active in the Turkish market, </p><p>though there is underlying agreement that intellectual </p><p>property issues need to be addressed, as is reflected in </p><p>PhRMA\'s latest submission.  Given the positive feedback on </p><p>the roundtable Mission organized in November (the third in </p><p>the past year), we will seek to organize such sessions on a </p><p>regular basis, though perhaps not quite as often as the </p><p>monthly session Giusti suggested.  A goal at some of these </p><p>sessions would also be to encourage dialogue between American </p><p>and Turkish pharmaceutical companies, something the </p><p>American-Turkish Council has also attempted to organize.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
