<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000288 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIRGINIA FLAG:  UPPING THE ANTE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  SWANSON/JESS FAX 1/30 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Dinh Bin has called </p><p>the Ambassador to a meeting as soon as possible after the </p><p>latter\'s return to Hanoi February 8 to deliver a "strong </p><p>protest" about the proposed Bill No. 2829 in the Virginia </p><p>House of Delegates regarding the Vietnamese flag.  (The bill </p><p>calls for the flying of the old South Vietnamese flag in </p><p>public instead of the current Socialist Republic of Vietnam </p><p>flag.)  Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien has already written </p><p>to the Secretary about this issue (ref), and National </p><p>Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vu Mao </p><p>separately wrote the Speaker of the Virginia House and the </p><p>Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.  The MFA noted that FM Nien </p><p>still awaits a response from the Secretary.  Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Vu Khoan is apparently also seized with this issue, </p><p>according to one MFA source. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  In a meeting with Charge on February 6, Assistant </p><p>Foreign Minister Nguyen Duc Hung made an emotional plea </p><p>against the possible passage of this legislation, noting the </p><p>serious consequences for the bilateral relationship and the </p><p>top level attention this issue has already received within </p><p>the MFA.  He was not comforted by Charge\'s explanation about </p><p>State\'s proactive efforts to weigh in with the House of </p><p>Delegates nor by a discussion of the Federal and </p><p>constitutional issues involved. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment:  This controversy is another example of </p><p>the GVN\'s ability to go overboard on what should be seen </p><p>here as an exercise in local democracy in the U.S. </p><p>Unfortunately, the GVN is apparently ill-served by its </p><p>Embassy in Washington and by its Americas experts at the </p><p>MFA.  They seem unable to explain the U.S. system to their </p><p>superiors or to convince them when and how to weigh in -- or </p><p>not -- with the U.S. Federal Government.  At a time when we </p><p>increasingly thought that both sides had moved beyond </p><p>judging the relationship on a single-issue basis, this is an </p><p>unhappy development.  Clearly, passage of this bill would be </p><p>unfortunate, and we remain hopeful that the Virginia </p><p>legislators will listen to State\'s counsel.  Clearly also, </p><p>should this bill become legislation, our work here will be </p><p>complicated by senior-level GVN resentment and suspicion. </p><p>DPM Khoan\'s involvement in this issue may also indicate that </p><p>the real opposition comes from within the Communist Party </p><p>hierarchy, given his concurrent role as secretary of the CPV </p><p>Secretariat. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
