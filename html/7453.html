Papers agree that Syrian President Bashar </p><p>Assad is the new target of the U.S.  Israeli Foreign </p><p>Minister Silvan Shalom held a joint press conference in </p><p>Ankara with Turkish FM Abdullah Gul.  Shalom asserted that </p><p>Damascus Airport has been a center for transferring arms and </p><p>ammunition to the Hizbullah.  Disagreeing with Shalom, Gul </p><p>said that a new war in the region should be avoided, and </p><p>added that greater stability would serve everyone, including </p><p>Israel.  Papers report that Ankara has decided to attend a </p><p>six-country summit meeting of Iran, Syria, Kuwait, Jordan, </p><p>Egypt and Lebanon to be hosted by Saudi Arabia to discuss </p><p>the reconstruction of Iraq.  Dailies also give extensive </p><p>coverage to peshmerge attacks against Turkomen in Kirkuk. </p><p>The Turkomen appealed to American officers after a 12-year </p><p>old Turkomen boy was killed by Kurdish militiamen, but to no </p><p>avail.  "Milliyet" reports the Turkomen are arming </p><p>themselves anc claim that they will soon recruit 10,000 </p><p>armed Turkomen.  However, the MFA has found that Turkomen </p><p>claims conflict with reports provided by Turkish </p><p>intelligence officers in the area.  KDP leader Barzani has </p><p>accused PUK leader Talabani of provoking widespread looting </p><p>by allowing his militia to enter Kirkuk, papers report.  TGS </p><p>and MFA have warned the U.S. about the incidents in the </p><p>region.  Foreign Minister Gul told "Radikal" that the </p><p>Americans would have objected to deployment of Turkish </p><p>troops in Northern Iraq even had Turkey opted for full </p><p>cooperation with the U.S. and the Kurds.  The fact that </p><p>Turkish forces would not have been allowed to approach Mosul </p><p>and Kirkuk is the main reason that parliament rejected full </p><p>cooperation on March 1, according to Gul.  Meanwhile, papers </p><p>report KDP leader Barzani as saying that the U.S. should </p><p>transfer Iraq\'s administration to federal rule as soon as </p><p>possible.  `No people would choose to live under constant </p><p>occupation,\' Barzani said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Israeli FM Shalom in Ankara: After receiving Israeli Foreign </p><p>Minister Shalom, President Sezer said that Turkey could </p><p>serve as a mediator for establishing peace between Israel </p><p>and the Palestinians.  Foreign Minister Gul advised his </p><p>Israeli counterpart that Israel should refrain from opening </p><p>new settlements on Palestinian land, and proposed a broad </p><p>summit meeting on the Palestine-Israel conflict to be held </p><p>in Istanbul.  Gul and Shalom also discussed joint </p><p>investments, tourism, and commercial cooperation between the </p><p>two countries.  A Turkish-Israeli agreement on the sale of </p><p>Manavgat water is expected to be signed in May. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Is Syria next? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What\'s America doing?" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna observed in conservative-mass appeal Turkiye </p><p>(4/15): "It seems that the US intends to topple the Syrian </p><p>Baath regime without the use of force.  In the event of </p><p>resistance from Damascus, US forces will enter Syria. . Next </p><p>on the US priority list will be the Palestinian issue.  Once </p><p>this issue and other related problems are settled, the US </p><p>will target Iran sometime next year.  For that plan, the US </p><p>needs both Turkey and Russia on its side. . US forces might </p><p>remain in Iraq for a year or two.  The American withdrawal </p><p>from Iraq will take place after a friendly administration is </p><p>established in the country.  It is likely that the US will </p><p>not intervene in the domestic politics of Iraq as long as </p><p>the new Iraqi regime is pro-American and supportive of the </p><p>US\'s oil and other interests.  In the wake of this reshaping </p><p>of the Middle East, Ankara needs a talented and capable team </p><p>to handle the situation and make sure that Turkey will not </p><p>be left out of the scene." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is Syria the next target?" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (4/15): </p><p>"Even before the restructuring of Iraq, hawks in the US have </p><p>launched another campaign for the implementation of the US </p><p>global empire plan which was designed before the 2000 </p><p>presidential elections.  The philosophy of this plan is </p><p>based on the US capability of conducting more than two wars </p><p>simultaneously.  Therefore we have started to see ultimatums </p><p>and threats issued to other countries, including Syria. . </p><p>Being threatened by the US does not necessarily happen </p><p>because a country possesses weapons of mass destruction. </p><p>Saddam, for instance, did not have WMD, and would not have </p><p>been able to use them even if he had.  But the US, despite </p><p>the fact that the pretext for the Iraq war has proven false, </p><p>continues to threaten Syria and Palestine.  There will </p><p>certainly be many others on that list.  The helplessness and </p><p>silence of the international community at this point is </p><p>indeed horrifying." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
