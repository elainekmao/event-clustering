(C) FOLLOWING THE HOLY SEE\'S REBUKE OF RUSSIA BEFORE OSCE </p><p>CHIEFS OF MISSION TO THE HOLY SEE FOR ITS SERIES OF </p><p>EXPULSIONS AND VISA DENIALS TO CATHOLIC CLERGY (REF A), </p><p>VATICAN OSCE DESK OFFICER TOLD POLOFF SEPTEMBER 30 THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE PLANS TO SEEK REDRESS WITHIN THE OSCE FOR THE </p><p>CANCELLATION OF VISAS AND/OR EXPULSION OF FIVE CATHOLIC </p><p>CLERGY BY RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES.  FM JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN HAS </p><p>DECIDED TO PURSUE THE ISSUE IN THE OSCE BY INVOKING ALREADY </p><p>AGREED OSCE AND UN LANGUAGE FROM DECLARATIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  IN DOING SO, THE HOLY SEE HOPES TO </p><p>AVOID SINGLING OUT RUSSIA FOR FAILINGS SHARED BY A NUMBER OF </p><p>OTHER MOSTLY FORMER SOVIET OSCE MEMBER STATES.  THE HOLY SEE </p><p>BELIEVES THE RUSSIAN VISA REFUSALS AND EXPULSIONS HAVE </p><p>CREATED A &REAL OBSTACLE FOR PEOPLE TO EXERCISE THEIR </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN RUSSIA TODAY.8 END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  HOLY SEE OSCE DESK OFFICER MONS. ETTORE BALESTRERO </p><p>OUTLINED FOR POLOFF SEPTEMBER 30 THE HOLY SEE,S OSCE-BASED </p><p>STRATEGY TO PRESSURE RUSSIA TO REVERSE A SERIES OF RECENT </p><p>VISA DENIALS AND EXPULSIONS OF CATHOLIC CLERGY (REFS C AND </p><p>D).  THEY ARE SEEKING RUSSIAN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ITS </p><p>COMMITMENTS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS LEVERAGE TO GET RUSSIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO ISSUE THE CATHOLIC CLERGY ENTRY AND VISAS THEY </p><p>HAVE RECENTLY DENIED.  BALESTRERO TOLD US THE HOLY SEE </p><p>INTENDS TO PURSUE THE CASE IN THE OSCE, INITIALLY AT THE </p><p>OCTOBER 4 PC IN VIENNA.  THEY HOPE TO GAIN AGREEMENT THERE TO </p><p>PURSUE A DECLARATION REAFFIRMING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO BE ISSUED AT THE PORTO MINISTERIAL IN </p><p>DECEMBER.  THE HOLY SEE CONSIDERS THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04742  01 OF 02  011200Z </p><p>VISA REFUSALS AND EXPULSIONS AS SERIOUS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>ISSUES THAT HAVE CREATED A &REAL OBSTACLE FOR PEOPLE TO </p><p>EXERCISE THEIR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN RUSSIA TODAY.8  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, BALESTRERO SAID HE DIDN\'T DETECT ANY ANTI-CATHOLIC </p><p>SENTIMENT IN HIS RUSSIAN INTERLOCUTORS AT THE WARSAW HUMAN </p><p>DIMENSION MEETING, BUT HE ENCOUNTERED THE SAME COMMENT </p><p>REPORTED REF A -) THAT THIS WAS A MATTER FOR THE HOLY SEE TO </p><p>WORK OUT DIRECTLY WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CONTRARY TO THE CLAIM REPORTED REF. B, THE HOLY SEE </p><p>DOES NOT BELIEVE IT MISSTEPPED IN CREATING THE FOUR DIOCESES </p><p>THAT THE GOR CLAIMS TRIGGERED THE RECENT RASH OF VISA </p><p>REFUSALS/EXPULSIONS OF CATHOLIC CLERGY.  THEY MAINTAIN THAT </p><p>ESTABLISHING THE DIOCESES WAS A NORMAL AND LONG OVERDUE </p><p>RESPONSE TO AN ABNORMAL SITUATION FOR THE CATHOLIC FAITHFUL </p><p>IN RUSSIA.  BALESTRERO DID CONCEDE THAT MANY IN RUSSIA </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT UNDERSTAND JUST HOW ROUTINE AN ACT THE </p><p>UPGRADING WAS.  HE SPECULATED THAT SOME LOCAL RUSSIAN </p><p>ORTHODOX CLERGY MAY HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN TO LOCAL GOR </p><p>OFFICIALS BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE MOVE, AND THAT </p><p>THOSE CONCERNS COULD HAVE BEEN PASSED UP TO CENTRAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES.  IN THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEW THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>CLERGY AND SOME IN THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WERE LOOKING FOR AN </p><p>EXCUSE TO SUPPRESS THE CATHOLIC CLERGY, AND GOT IT WHEN THE </p><p>HOLY SEE UPGRADED THE APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATIONS TO DIOCESES. </p><p>HE BELIEVED THAT IF THE HOLY SEE HADN\'T MADE THE DIOCESAN </p><p>DECISION, SOMETHING ELSE WOULD HAVE SERVED AS THE OCCASION </p><p>FOR THE ACTIONS.  AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE STRESSED, THE </p><p>VISAS AND ENTRY PERMITS WERE REFUSED BY CIVIL, NOT CHURCH </p><p>AUTHORITIES, IN VIOLATION OF RUSSIA\'S SOLEMN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMITMENTS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04742  01 OF 02  011200Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) COMMENT: THERE ARE VERY FEW APOSTOLIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  MOST ARE IN PLACES </p><p>LIKE PRIZREN IN KOSOVO, OR THE CORMOROS.  ALL OF THEM ARE </p><p>SEEN TO BE TEMPORARY MEASURES UNTIL THE MORE NORMAL CONDITION </p><p>OF A DIOCESE IS ESTABLISHED.  THE CREATION OF A DIOCESE </p><p>ESSENTIALLY GIVES ITS BISHOP MORE AUTONOMY FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY </p><p>RUNNING OF CHURCH AFFAIRS.  THE HOLY SEE UNDERTOOK NUMEROUS </p><p>MEASURES TO ALLEVIATE ANY HEARTBURN BY THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH WHEN CREATING THESE DIOCESES AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE </p><p>OF APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, THEY AVOIDED </p><p>NAMING THEM FOR THEIR SEES, AS IN &MOSCOW,8 SO THAT THERE </p><p>WOULD NOT BE A CATHOLIC BISHOP OF MOSCOW AT THE SAME TIME AS </p><p>THERE WAS AN ORTHODOX BISHOP OF MOSCOW.  AND IN SAKHALIN, </p><p>THEY NAMED A POLE, BISHOP MAZUR, INSTEAD OF THE JAPANESE, </p><p>BISHOP PETER JINUSHI, PRECISELY TO AVOID ANY IMPLICATION THAT </p><p>THE HOLY SEE SUPPORTS THE RETURN OF SOUTHERN SAKHALIN TO </p><p>JAPAN.  NEVERTHELESS, THE HOLY SEE FEELS STRONGLY THAT THE </p><p>CHURCH HAS TO TAKE CARE OF ITS OWN BUSINESS IN RUSSIA AS </p><p>ELSEWHERE, AND CANNOT SACRIFICE ITS PASTORAL REQUIREMENTS </p><p>INDEFINITELY TO PLACATE THE UNFOUNDED FEARS OF THE RUSSIAN </p><p>ORTHODOX CHURCH. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  COMMENT CONTINUED:  WHILE THE HOLY SEE IS WILLING </p><p>TO TAKE AN INDIRECT APPROACH AT THE OSCE TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4712 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  04742  02 OF 02  011200Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    ED-01    FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------EF8DC5  011200Z /38 </p><p>O 011128Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 004742 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/RUS, DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KIRF, SOCI, PL, RS, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE TO TAKE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CONCERNS TO </p><p>OSCE: STRATEGY FOR RUSSIAN VISA RELIEF </p><p> </p><p>OF ITS CLERGY, IT DOES REGARD RUSSIAN ACTIONS AS AN </p><p>INCREASINGLY SERIOUS INFRINGEMENT ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. </p><p>GIVEN THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM HAS PLAYED IN </p><p>JOHN PAUL II\'S PONTIFICATE, THE HOLY SEE CAN BE EXPECTED TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO PRESS ITS CASE ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM GROUNDS UNTIL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04742  02 OF 02  011200Z </p><p>IT ACHIEVES A BETTER ACCOMMODATION WITH RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA04742 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
