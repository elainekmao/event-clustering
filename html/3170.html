<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 003008 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EIND, EAIR, PINR, EAIR, PINR, IT, ITEIND </p><p>SUBJECT: CHANGING CHAIRS IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT OF ITALY, SPECIFICALLY THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>ECONOMY AND FINANCE, RECENTLY CHANGED ITS SENIOR LEADERSHIP </p><p>IN THREE OF THE CORPORATIONS IN WHICH IT HAS A MAJOR </p><p>INTEREST:  ENI (ITALIAN HYDROCARBON AGENCY), ENEL (NATIONAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03008  01 OF 02  191507Z </p><p>ELECTRICITY COMPANY), AND FINMECCANICA (A GROUP OF DEFENSE, </p><p>AVIATION AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRY COMPANIES).  THESE ARE THE </p><p>THREE LARGEST INDUSTRIAL GROUPS REMAINING CONTROLLED BY THE </p><p>GOI.  THE APPOINTMENTS WERE WELL RECEIVED BY THE FINANCIAL </p><p>MARKETS WHICH PERCEIVED THEM AS A WELCOMED SIGN OF CONTINUITY. </p><p> </p><p>FINMECCANICA </p><p>------------ </p><p>2.  (SBU) PIERFRANCESCO GUARGUAGLINI, FORMER PRESIDENT OF </p><p>FINCANTIERI (ITALIAN SHIPBUILDERS\' ASSOCIATION) IS THE NEWLY </p><p>APPOINTED CHAIRMAN OF FINMECCANCA.  GUARGUALINI, BORN IN </p><p>1937, HOLDS A PH.D. IN ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING FROM THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.  IN ADDITION TO HARMONY WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, CONTINUITY AND MARKET CONFIDENCE, GUARGUAGLINI </p><p>MAY HAVE A MANDATE TO INCREASE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF THE </p><p>COMPANY.  FINMECCANICA IS A PARTIALLY STATE-OWNED COMPANY </p><p>(37.4 PERCENT OWNED BY THE GOI) HOLDING THE MAJOR ITALIAN </p><p>AEROSPACE PLAYERS (ALENIA AERONAUTICA, ALENIA DIFESA, ALENIA </p><p>SPAZIO, 50 PERCENT OF ALENIA MARCONI SYSTEMS, AND 25 PERCENT </p><p>OF AERMACCHI).  ALTHOUGH THERE IS SPECULATION ABOUT CONTINUED </p><p>PRIVATIZATION WHEN THE MARKETS STRENGTHEN, GUARGUAGLINI SAID, </p><p>AT A RECENT LUNCH WITH AMBASSADOR SEMBLER THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>DOES NOT WISH TO PRIVATIZE ANY MORE OF FINMECCANICA, THUS </p><p>PROTECTING ITALY\'S STRATEGIC AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES.  HE </p><p>ALLOWED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY DECIDE TO SPLIT SOME OF THE </p><p>COMPANIES INTO CIVIL AND DEFENSE COMPONENTS AND PRIVATIZE THE </p><p>CIVILIAN ELEMENTS, BUT EVEN THIS HAS NOT BEEN DECIDED. </p><p>GUARGUAGLINI ALSO CONFIRMED RUMOR THAT FINMECCANICA WILL BE </p><p>EXPECTED TO TAKE OVER FINCANTIERI, THE CORPORATION HE </p><p>PREVIOUS HEADED.  STILL OWNED 100 PERCENT BY THE GOI, </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN SLATED TO BE PRIVATIZED, FINCANTIERI </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03008  01 OF 02  191507Z </p><p>EMPLOYS ROUGHLY 10,000, HAS A TURNOVER AROUND TWO BILLION </p><p>EUROS/YEAR, AND HAS SUBSTANTIAL ORDERS FOR ITS SPECIALTIES -- </p><p>CRUISE AND NAVAL SHIPS.  FINCANTIERI AND FINMECCANICA HAVE </p><p>TRADITIONALLY WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER, AND COULD SHARE MORE </p><p>THAN FIVE BILLION EUROS IN CONSTRUCTION IF THE NAVY SPENDS </p><p>THIS ON A NEW CLASS OF FRIGATES. GUARGUAGLINI ALSO NOTED </p><p>THAT, ALTHOUGH FINMECCANICA HAD DROPPED ITS BID TO BUY </p><p>MARCONI COMMUNICATION FOR THE TIME BEING, THEY FULLY EXPECT </p><p>MARCONI TO BE WILLING TO PURSUE THE DEAL A LITTLE LATER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ROBERTO TESTORE IS THE NEWLY APPOINTED MANAGING </p><p>DIRECTOR AND DIRECTOR GENERAL OF FINMECCANICA.  GIVEN THAT HE </p><p>WAS A FIAT EMPLOYEE (SINCE 1976) AND THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF </p><p>FIAT AUTO (SINCE 1996), SOME THINK THAT HE MAY BE LOOKING TO </p><p>CONSOLIDATE FIAT\'S DEFENSE BUSINESS INTO FINMECCANICA.  HIS </p><p>NEW RESPONSIBILITY HOWEVER FOCUSES ON THE GROUP\'S OPERATIONAL </p><p>MANAGEMENT AND ON THE INTERNAL REORGANIZATION OF THE </p><p>FINANCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  SENIOR MANAGEMENT\'S VIEW ON PRIVATIZING </p><p>FINMECCANICA IS AT VARIANCE WITH WHAT WE HEAR ELSEWHERE.  IT </p><p>IS POSSIBLE THAT, AFTER HAVING MET THE EU\'S MINIMAL </p><p>PRIVATIZATION REQUIREMENTS, THE GOI WILL NOT PRIVATIZE ANY </p><p>MORE OF FINMECCANICA.  THERE IS ALSO THE VIEW THAT SELLING </p><p>OFF THE COMMERCIAL ELEMENTS LEAVES THE WEAKER COMPONENTS IN </p><p>GOI HANDS, WITH A NEED FOR LONG-TERM SUPPORT.  MARCONI </p><p>COMMUNICATION IS NOT PRIZE, BUT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING </p><p>TO \'PROTECT\' WEAK DEFENSE PLAYERS, MARCONI MAY EVENTUALLY BE </p><p>ASSIMILATED INTO FINMECCANICA.  OUR VIEW ON FINMECCANICA\'S </p><p>ACQUIRING FIAT\'S DEFENSE INDUSTRIES IS THAT IT WOULD NOT LEAD </p><p>TO ANY NET SYNERGIES, BUT JUST BE TRADING ONE FORM OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03008  01 OF 02  191507Z </p><p>POLITICAL POWER WITH ANOTHER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ENI </p><p>--- </p><p>5.   (U) THE GOI OWNS MORE THAN 30 PERCENT OF ENI WHICH IS </p><p>MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED ON ENERGY AND ENSURING ITALY\'S ENERGY </p><p>SECURITY.  ENI ONLY HAD A PARTIAL CHANGE IN THE BOARD BECAUSE </p><p>VITTORIO MINCATO, THE MANAGING DIRECTOR, HAS BEEN </p><p>RECONFIRMED. MINCATO HAS ONLY BEEN IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS, AND IS WIDELY REPUTED AS SHOWING STRONG LEADERSHIP. </p><p>HE WILL BE SUPPORTED BY A NEWLY NAMED CHAIRMAN, ROBERTO POLI, </p><p>WHO IS A WELL-KNOWN EXPERT IN CORPORATE FINANCING.  FROM 1978 </p><p>TO 1998 HE TAUGHT CORPORATE FINANCE AT CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>MILAN.  POLI HAS IN THE PAST BEEN CHAIRMAN OF PUBLITALIA OF </p><p>THE BERLUSCONI GROUP AND A MAIN CONSULTANT OF THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>FAMILY IN THE RESTORATION OF FININVEST, BERLUSCONI\'S ASSET </p><p>HOLDING COMPANY. </p><p> </p><p>ENEL </p><p>---- </p><p>6.   (U) TO THE SURPRISE OF MANY THERE WAS A COMPLETE </p><p>OVERHAUL AT ENEL WHERE THE GOVERNMENT OWNS ABOUT 70 PERCENT. </p><p> PAOLO SCARONI WILL BECOME THE NEW MANAGING DIRECTOR. HE HAS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4659 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03008  02 OF 02  191508Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  DSCC-00  G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------BF850B  191520Z /38 </p><p>R 191435Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 4340 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003008 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EIND, EAIR, PINR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: CHANGING CHAIRS IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p>BEEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF PILKINGTON AEROSPACE, A BRITISH </p><p>MULTINATIONAL, AND HE IS ALSO A CONSULTANT OF BAE.  AS </p><p>MANAGING DIRECTOR OF TECHINT, HE WAS CONDEMNED TO ONE YEAR </p><p>AND FOUR MONTHS FOR PAYING BRIBES TO THE PSI (PARTITO </p><p>SOCIALISTA ITALIANO) PARTY FOR ILLEGAL BIDS IN ENEL\'S POWER </p><p>PLANTS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03008  02 OF 02  191508Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) PIERO GNUDI WILL BECOME THE PRESIDENT, AND LEAVE </p><p>HIS POSITION AS CHAIRMAN OF IRI (THE FORMER STATE HOLDING </p><p>COMPANY FOR GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES), WHICH IS REACHING THE </p><p>END OF ITS NATURAL LIFE.  GNUDI IS VIEWED AS A FAMILIAR FACE </p><p>AND GIVEN HIS EXPERIENCE AT IRI WITH LIQUIDATING ITALIAN </p><p>PARASTATALS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE NEXT </p><p>STEP IN THE PRIVATIZATION OF ENEL WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) FERNANDO NAPOLETANO, NEWLY APPOINTED TO THE BOARD </p><p>OF ENEL, CONFIRMED IN HIS INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR REPORTS THAT MINISTER OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES </p><p>MARZANO HAS GIVEN ENEL THE MANDATE TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND </p><p>ABROAD IN ITS MAJOR SECTORS:  ENERGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT ENVISIONS A MULTI-SECTOR CORPORATION ALONG THE </p><p>LINES OF A GE TYPE OF OPERATION.  NAPOLETANO, THE HEAD OF </p><p>BOOZ, ALLEN, HAMILTON ITALIA, EMPHATICALLY SAID EXPANSION WAS </p><p>THE ONLY REASON HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO THE BOARD AND THE </p><p>ONLY REASON HE HAD ANY ADDED VALUE FOR ENEL. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>9.  (SBU) WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE CHANGES IN THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THESE GROUPS WILL HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT FOR U.S. </p><p>CORPORATIONS.  THE TOP MANAGERS ARE ALL CITED AS COMPETENT </p><p>AND AUTHORITATIVE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FIELD.   WHAT IS </p><p>HAPPENING HOWEVER IS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS STAMPING ITS OWN </p><p>BUSINESS ORIENTED STYLE ON THE LEADERSHIP.  THE OUT-GOING </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAD SALTED SENIOR POSITIONS WITH CLOSE ALLIES; </p><p>WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THESE CHANGES IS NOT THAT THEY </p><p>OCCURRED BUT THAT THEY TOOK SO LONG TO OCCUR.  THIS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03008  02 OF 02  191508Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS NOT NECESSARILY PUTTING IN PARTY FAVORITES, BUT </p><p>RATHER THEY APPEAR TO BE SEEKING THOSE WHO ARE WELL-KNOWN TO </p><p>THEM WHO ALSO HAVE A STRONG AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS </p><p>ORIENTATION. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03008 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
