(C) SUMMARY: AS PART OF A MAJOR GENERATIONAL CHANGE IN </p><p>SENIOR COMMUNIST PARTY RANKS, MODERATE NONG DUC MANH WAS </p><p>OFFICIALLY INSTALLED AS VIETNAM\'S SENIOR LEADER APRIL 23 AT </p><p>THE CLOSE OF THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS.  AS EXPECTED, </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHIEF MANH REPLACED THE STRONGLY </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL LE KHA PHIEU.  ONLY THE SIXTH COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>LEADER IN SIX DECADES, MANH IS THE FIRST WITHOUT </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY OR WARTIME WORK EXPERIENCE, THE FIRST WITH A </p><p>UNIVERSITY DEGREE, AND THE FIRST ETHNIC MINORITY.  COUPLED </p><p>WITH THE ABOLITION OF ALL PARTY SENIOR ADVISOR POSITIONS, </p><p>THE RETIREMENT OF AGING CONSERVATIVES IN THE POLITBURO, A </p><p>DRASTICALLY REDUCED LEADERSHIP PROFILE FOR THE MILITARY, </p><p>AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STREAMLINED SECRETARIAT TO </p><p>PROMOTE EFFICIENCY, MANH\'S ELEVATION MAY WELL PROVIDE A </p><p>MUCH-NEEDED BOOST FOR THE ECONOMIC REFORM AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY (CONT\'D): PRIME MINISTER KHAI IS NOW JOINED </p><p>IN THE TOP RANKS BY FELLOW SOUTHERN REFORMERS TRIET AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00965  01 OF 05  231115Z </p><p>DUNG, WHO WERE PROMOTED TO FOURTH AND FIFTH IN THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP, SIGNALING THEY ARE HIS HEIRS IN WAITING. </p><p>ANOTHER POSITIVE SIGNAL IS THAT REFORMIST TRADE MINISTER VU </p><p>KHOAN, REPORTEDLY TO BE ELECTED A DEPUTY PM NEXT MONTH, </p><p>WILL ACT AS VIRTUAL "POLITBURO CHIEF OF STAFF" WORKING ON </p><p>THE NEW SECRETARIAT.  THOUGH CONSERVATIVE INTERESTS STILL </p><p>ARE REPRESENTED IN THE LEADERSHIP, THEIR PROFILE IS MUCH </p><p>LOWER.  ELECTION OF THIS LEADERSHIP WAS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR </p><p>REFORMERS IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>MANH\'S ASCENSION PART OF A DRAMATIC GENERATIONAL CHANGE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE SELECTION OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN NONG DUC </p><p>MANH, 60, AS THE SIXTH GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) IS AN IMPORTANT GENERATIONAL </p><p>MILESTONE FOR THE PARTY AND COUNTRY.  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S POST-COLONIAL HISTORY, THE SENIOR LEADER WILL NOT </p><p>BE A MILITARY OR CIVILIAN "VETERAN" OF THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>"NATIONAL LIBERATION" WARS.  (TRUONG CHINH, LE DUAN, NGUYEN </p><p>VAN LINH, AND DO MUOI ALL WERE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>GENERATION THAT HAD LED THE FIGHT AGAINST THE FRENCH AND </p><p>AGAINST THE U.S.-BACKED REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM GOVERNMENT.  LE </p><p>KHA PHIEU, 69, WHO RETIRED YESTERDAY, WAS A LONG-TIME </p><p>MILITARY POLITICAL COMMISSAR WHO PLAYED A PROMINENT ROLE IN </p><p>VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA, AS WELL AS SERVICE IN </p><p>THE "NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE" STRUGGLE.  PHIEU, WHO CAME IN </p><p>UNDER UNPRECEDENTED PROCEDURES IN 1997, PROVED TO A </p><p>TRANSITORY FIGURE AND WAS THE ONLY GENERAL SECRETARY TO </p><p>FACE THE IGNOMINY OF NOT FINISHING A FULL TERM IN OFFICE.) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00965  01 OF 05  231115Z </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MANH, OFFICIALLY INSTALLED APRIL 23 IN A "UNANIMOUS </p><p>VOTE" BY THE 1,168 VOTING DELEGATES AT THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, WAS IN FACT SELECTED DURING THE PRE-CONGRESS </p><p>MEETING OF THE CPV LEADERSHIP APRIL 16-17.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>SEVERAL SOURCES, MANH POLLED A MAJORITY OF VOTES (FROM 55- </p><p>60 PERCENT) BOTH IN THE PRE-CONGRESS AND THE FINAL CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE PLENUM, WHICH PRECEDED IT, THOUGH HE ONLY AGREED </p><p>TO TAKE THE POST ON CONDITION THAT THE CPV\'S THREE "SENIOR </p><p>ADVISORS" WOULD STEP DOWN FROM THEIR POSTS.  (IRONICALLY </p><p>THIS WAS A KEY OBJECTIVE OF PHIEU\'S, AND SEVERAL SOURCES </p><p>SUGGEST THIS WAS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT LED TO THE </p><p>ADVISORS\' PRESSING FOR HIS OUSTER.)  NGUYEN VAN AN, CPV </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL DIRECTOR, WAS THE OTHER POLITBURO MEMBER TO </p><p>RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR, THOUGH </p><p>MANH\'S BROAD POPULARITY AMONG CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS, </p><p>BUILT UP OVER HIS NINE YEARS OF SERVICE AS NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY CHAIR, APPEARS TO HAVE CARRIED HIM TO VICTORY. </p><p>(REF A DOCUMENTS HOW MANH\'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WORK, FOR </p><p>WHICH HE HAS BEEN MUCH PRAISED BY HIS COLLEAGUES, SERVED TO </p><p>BUILD A BROAD CONSTITUENCY OF SUPPORT FOR HIM.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE GENERATIONAL CHANGE TO MANH IS STRIKING IN </p><p>SEVERAL WAYS.  NOT ONLY IS HE NINE YEARS YOUNGER THAN </p><p>PHIEU, MANH IS A FULL GENERATION YOUNGER THAN DO MUOI, WHO </p><p>ONLY 3-1/2 YEARS AGO WAS GENERAL SECRETARY.  THE CHANGE IN </p><p>PERSPECTIVE CAN BE ILLUSTRATED BY THE FORMATIVE EVENTS OF </p><p>THEIR PROFESSIONAL LIVES: IN 1975 DO MUOI WAS IN HIS MID- </p><p>50\'S AND HAD DEVOTED THREE DECADES TO THE "NATIONAL </p><p>LIBERATION STRUGGLE."  PHIEU WAS A 43-YEAR-OLD POLITICAL </p><p>COMMISSAR IN THE MILITARY.  BY CONTRAST, MANH WAS ONLY 34 </p><p>IN 1975, HAVING COMPLETED A DEGREE IN FORESTRY AND STUDIES </p><p>IN LENINGRAD, AND WAS WORKING AS A FORESTRY OFFICIAL IN HIS </p><p>NATIVE BAC THAI PROVINCE IN NORTHERN VIETNAM.  MANH HAD </p><p>BEEN A CPV MEMBER SINCE 1963, THOUGH HIS WORK DURING THE </p><p>WAR YEARS WAS PRIMARILY TECHNOCRATIC. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) FOLLOWING HIS WORK IN FORESTRY, MANH MOVED ON TO TWO </p><p>YEARS OF CPV POLITICAL TRAINING AT NGUYEN AI QUOC </p><p>INSTITUTE, FOLLOWING BY A DECADE OF WORK IN PROVINCIAL CPV </p><p>AFFAIRS.  HE WORKED AS VICE CHAIRMAN AND THEN CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>THE BAC THAI PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, THEN SERVED AS PROVINCIAL </p><p>PARTY SECRETARY THERE.  HE BEGAN A CANDIDATE MEMBER TO THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN 1986 (AT THE "DOI MOI" SIXTH CONGRESS) </p><p>AND BECAME A FULL MEMBER IN 1989, WHEN HE WAS NAMED CHAIR </p><p>OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S NATIONALITIES COMMISSION.  (MANH </p><p>IS A MEMBER OF THE TAY ETHNIC MINORITY, THE COUNTRY\'S MOST </p><p>POPULOUS MINORITY, AND ONE OF THE GROUPS MOST INTEGRATED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00965  02 OF 05  231115Z </p><p>INTO ETHNIC KINH VIETNAMESE SOCIETY.)  IN 1991 HE JOINED </p><p>THE POLITBURO AND WAS NAMED CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>THE NEXT YEAR.  IN THE PAST NINE YEARS HE HAS PRESIDED OVER </p><p>THE GRADUAL EXPANSION OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY INTO A MORE </p><p>GENUINELY DELIBERATIVE BODY THAT HAS INCREASED ITS ROLE IN </p><p>DEBATING SOCIO-ECONOMIC ISSUES AND QUESTIONING MINISTERS. </p><p>(SEE REF A FOR FURTHER ON HIS ACTIVITIES AS ASSEMBLY </p><p>CHAIR.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>RETIREMENT OF ADVISORS, POLITBURO SEPTUAGENARIANS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IF THE ONLY CHANGE COMING OF THE CONGRESS WAS THE </p><p>REPLACEMENT OF THE HIGHLY IDEOLOGICAL PHIEU WITH THE MORE </p><p>MODERATE MANH, THIS WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT SHIFT, THOUGH </p><p>HARDLY AN EPOCHAL ONE.  MANH GETS HIGH MARKS FROM HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES FOR BEING MORE PRAGMATIC, FOR BEING A GOOD </p><p>LISTENER, FOR BEING LESS BOUND BY IDEOLOGY, BUT AT THE END </p><p>OF THE DAY, HE IS A COMMITTED COMMUNIST, AND ONE WHO </p><p>APPEARS NOT TO COUNTENANCE ANY RIVALS TO THE CPV\'S ETERNAL </p><p>MONOPOLY ON POLITICAL POWER.  BUT WHAT MAKES THE RESULTS OF </p><p>THIS CONGRESS FAR MORE FAR-REACHING ARE THE COMBINATION OF </p><p>OTHER PERSONNEL AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT WERE MADE. </p><p>TAKEN TOGETHER, WE BELIEVE THESE CHANGES ADD UP TO A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT VICTORY FOR THE MORE REFORM-MINDED AMONG THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE CPV\'S THREE SENIOR </p><p>ADVISORS ALL STEPPED DOWN FROM THEIR POSITIONS, AND THE CPV </p><p>ANNOUNCED THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER SENIOR ADVISORS.  IN A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00965  02 OF 05  231115Z </p><p>DRAMATIC SYMBOL OF THE PASSING OF THE TORCH, MANH PRESENTED </p><p>BOUQUETS OF FLOWERS TO DO MUOI, FORMER PRESIDENT LE DUC </p><p>ANH, FORMER PRIME MINISTER VO VAN KIET AND ALSO FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT (AND ANH\'S PREDECESSOR) VO CHI CONG IN </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THEIR LIFETIME OF WORK.  MANH ALSO </p><p>EXCHANGED VALEDICTORY SPEECHES WITH PHIEU, AND THEY </p><p>EXCHANGED FLOWERS AND HUGS TO SHOW ALL WAS "UNITY, UNITY, </p><p>GREAT UNITY" AMONG THE LEADERSHIP.  (NOTE: INTERESTINGLY, </p><p>CONG WAS SEATED ON THE FRONT ROW OF THE DAIS BETWEEN PM </p><p>KHAI AND MANH, AND THE FRAIL FORMER LEADER WAS HELPED ON </p><p>STAGE BY MANH BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE CONGRESS\' CLOSING </p><p>SESSION.  THE INCLUSION OF CONG AS THE FIRST OF THE FOUR </p><p>ADVISORS THAT MANH ACKNOWLEDGED WAS TELLING: BY INCLUDING </p><p>HIM, THE REMAINING SURVIVING MEMBER OF THE PHAM VAN DONG- </p><p>NGUYEN VAN LINH TRIUMVIRATE THAT STEPPED DOWN IN 1991, MANH </p><p>WAS SYMBOLICALLY PLACING MUOI, ANH AND KIET -- AND PHIEU AS </p><p>WELL -- IN A LARGER GROUP OF CPV VETERANS AND SENIOR </p><p>ADVISORS WHO WERE MOVING OFF THE STAGE.  THE IMPLICATION </p><p>WAS CLEAR: THEIR TIME HAD PAST, AND A NEW GENERATION OF </p><p>LEADERS WAS TAKING OVER.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) IN REMARKS TO A PRESS CONFERENCE HELD AFTER THE </p><p>CLOSING SESSION, MANH REINFORCED THE GENERATIONAL </p><p>TRANSITION THEME.  RESPONDING TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE </p><p>SENIOR ADVISORS, THE NEW GENERAL SECRETARY SAID THE CPV HAS </p><p>GONE THROUGH "DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT" AND ONE </p><p>PRINCIPLE THE CPV EMBRACES IS "THE SUCCESSION OF </p><p>GENERATIONS."  HE NOTED ALL THE SENIOR ADVISORS ARE "AGED" </p><p>AND WHILE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR IDEAS TO </p><p>THE CPV AND ITS OFFICES, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE WILL NOT </p><p>CONTINUE THE TRADITION OF HAVING ADVISORS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) IN ADDITION TO THE ABOLITION OF THE SENIOR ADVISOR </p><p>POSITIONS, MOST OF THE POLITBURO\'S ELDERLY MEMBERS RETIRED. </p><p>AS EXPECTED, SEVEN POLITBURO MEMBERS WERE DROPPED FROM THE </p><p>BODY AND THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AS WELL: PHIEU, 69; </p><p>FATHERLAND FRONT HEAD PHAM THE DUYET, 64; HO CHI MINH </p><p>POLITICAL ACADEMY DIRECTOR NGUYEN DUC BINH, 73; DEPUTY PM </p><p>NGUYEN MANH CAM, 71; ARMY POLITICAL DIRECTOR PHAM THANH </p><p>NGAN, 62; NGUYEN THI XUAN MY, 60; AND CPV IDEOLOGY CHIEF LE </p><p>XUAN TUNG, 64.  BINH, CAM AND PHIEU WERE THE OLDEST MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE BODY, AND AMONG THE SEVEN, ONLY CAM WAS A MEMBER OF </p><p>PRO-REFORM CAMP.  PHIEU, BINH AND NGAN, IN FACT, WERE AMONG </p><p>THOSE MOST RESISTANT TO RAPID MOVEMENT FORWARD ON REFORM. </p><p>(SEPTEL REPORTS ON EMBASSY\'S TRACKING OF THE OLD POLITBURO </p><p>MEMBERS IN THE RUN-UP TO THE CONGRESS.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00965  03 OF 05  231116Z </p><p>A YOUNGER POLITBURO WITH A STRENGTHENED REFORMIST BLOC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THE NEW 15-MEMBER POLITBURO AND 150-MEMBER CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE ARE LEANER, YOUNGER, AND BETTER EDUCATED THAN </p><p>THEIR 19-MEMBER AND 170-MEMBER PREDECESSORS THAT WERE </p><p>APPROVED FIVE YEARS AGO.  (THE NUMBERS OF THE OUTGOING </p><p>BODIES WERE SLIGHTLY REDUCED BECAUSE OF DEATHS AND </p><p>RETIREMENTS.)  OVERALL, BOTH THE NEW POLITBURO AND CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE GIVE GREATER PROMINENCE TO REFORMERS, AND IN </p><p>PARTICULAR IT IS NOTABLE THAT SOUTHERN REFORMERS NGUYEN </p><p>MINH TRIET, HEAD OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY CPV, AND NGUYEN </p><p>TAN DUNG, FIRST DEPUTY PM, WERE PROMOTED TO FOUR AND FIVE </p><p>IN THE LEADERSHIP BETWEEN MANH, LUONG AND KHAI. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) THE NEW POLITBURO LINE-UP IN OFFICIAL PRECEDENCE </p><p>ORDER: </p><p> </p><p>-- 1. NONG DUC MANH, CURRENTLY HEAD OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>-- 2. TRAN DUC LUONG, PRESIDENT </p><p>-- 3. PHAN VAN KHAI, PRIME MINISTER </p><p>-- 4. NGUYEN MINH TRIET, HCMC PARTY CHIEF </p><p>-- 5. NGUYEN TAN DUNG, FIRST DEPUTY PM </p><p>-- 6. LE MINH HUONG, MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY </p><p>-- 7. NGUYEN PHU TRONG, HANOI PARTY CHIEF </p><p>-- 8. PHAN DIEN, DANANG PARTY CHIEF </p><p>-- 9. LE HONG ANH, HEAD OF CPV CENTRAL CONTROL COMMISSION </p><p>-- 10. TRUONG TAN SANG, CHAIR OF CPV ECONOMIC COMMISSION </p><p>-- 11. SR. LTG PHAM VAN TRA, MINISTER OF DEFENSE </p><p>-- 12. NGUYEN VAN AN, HEAD OF CPV ORGANIZATIONAL COMMISSION </p><p>-- 13. TRUONG QUANG DUOC, HEAD OF CPV MASS MOBILIZATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00965  03 OF 05  231116Z </p><p>-- 14. TRAN DINH HOAN, HEAD OF CENTRAL COMMITTEE OFFICE </p><p>-- 15. NGUYEN KHOA DIEM, MINISTER OF CULTURE & INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) THE NEW POLITBURO IS STRIKING FOR THE LOW LEVEL OF </p><p>MILITARY PARTICIPATION, WHICH IS UNPRECEDENTED IN MODERN </p><p>VIETNAM.  THE ONLY MILITARY MEMBER REMAINING ON THE </p><p>POLITBURO IS DEFENSE MINISTER PHAM VAN TRA, RANKED A LOWLY </p><p>11TH OUT OF 15, WITH ONLY AN AND THREE NEW MEMBERS RANKED </p><p>BELOW HIM.  (FOR BOTH TRA, 65, AND AN, 63, IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>IT IS STRIKING THEY WERE NOT ACCORDED THE RESPECT OF </p><p>"SENIORITY" THAT NORMALLY IS ACCORDED THOSE IN THE </p><p>POLITBURO OF ELDER RANK.  IN THE OUTGOING POLITBURO THE </p><p>SENIOR MEMBERS CAM AND BINH WERE ACCORDED A MORE SENIOR </p><p>RANK JUST BELOW THE THEN FIVE-MEMBER STANDING BOARD, WHICH </p><p>WAS ABOLISHED AT THIS CONGRESS.  AT THIS CONGRESS, TRA AND </p><p>AN WERE DROPPED UNCEREMONIOUSLY.)  AS DOCUMENTED </p><p>PREVIOUSLY, TRA WAS CENSURED BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE FOR </p><p>"MANAGEMENT FAILURES" ONLY WEEKS AGO, AND INITIALLY THE </p><p>EXPECTATION WAS HE WOULD BE DROPPED FROM THE POLITBURO.  HE </p><p>SURVIVED, BUT IN A WEAKENED POSITION, AND VIETNAM\'S </p><p>MILITARY IS LESS WELL-REPRESENTED THAN AT ANY TIME. </p><p>(TRADITIONALLY, ONE OF THE THREE SENIOR POSITIONS IS </p><p>OCCUPIED BY A MILITARY VETERAN, SUCH AS LE DUC ANH OR </p><p>PHIEU.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) A FURTHER "SYMBOL" OF TRA\'S STATUS PERHAPS COULD BE </p><p>INFERRED FROM WHAT APPEARED TO BE LAST-MINUTE REVISIONS TO </p><p>MANH\'S CLOSING SPEECH TO THE CONGRESS YESTERDAY.  MANH, </p><p>SITTING AT THE DAIS ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE HIS SPEECH, </p><p>APPEARED TO WRITE CHANGES ON A MANUSCRIPT AND HE THEN </p><p>PASSED THEM DOWN THROUGH KIET, CAM AND BINH TO THE END OF </p><p>THE DAIS, WHERE TRA WAS SITTING ON THE END.  TRA TWICE IN </p><p>15 MINUTES WAS FORCED TO GET UP WITH A PAPER AND WALK OFF </p><p>THE STAGE TO HAND THEM TO STAFF.  THOUGH PERHAPS THE LUCK </p><p>OF THE DRAWER FOR THE GUY ON THE END, IT WAS STRIKING THAT </p><p>ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR POLITBURO MEMBERS WAS A "GOFER" FOR </p><p>THE NEW GENERAL SECRETARY.  IN ANY EVENT, THE VISUAL </p><p>IMPRESSION WAS SYMBOLIC OF TRA\'S REDUCED STATUS. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) AS REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, THE RETIREMENT OF ARMED </p><p>FORCES POLITICAL COMMISSAR LT. GEN. NGAN WAS THE BIGGEST </p><p>SURPRISE OF THOSE DROPPED FROM THE POLITBURO.  MULTIPLE </p><p>SOURCES REPORT HE, LIKE PHIEU, WAS DROPPED IN LARGE PART </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE USE OF MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ASSETS AGAINST FELLOW POLITBURO MEMBERS.  (IN </p><p>COMMENTS TO THE PRESS AT THE CONGRESS, KIET SEEMED TO </p><p>CONFIRM THIS PLAYED A PART IN PHIEU\'S DOWNFALL.)  (COMMENT: </p><p>WHILE THE MILITARY IS SMARTING FROM THIS DEMOTION, THIS MAY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00965  04 OF 05  231116Z </p><p>HELP SPUR PROFESSIONALIZATION AND GREATER CIVILIAN CONTROL </p><p>OF THE MILITARY IN VIETNAM.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>THE FOUR NEW POLITBURO MEMBERS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) THE FOUR NEW POLITBURO MEMBERS ARE LE HONG ANH, </p><p>TRUONG QUANG DUOC, TRAN DINH HOAN, AND NGUYEN KHOA DIEM. </p><p>THESE FOUR ARE GENERALLY SEEN AS MODERATE OR REFORMIST, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE SWEDISH DCM, WHO HAS SERVED SEVERAL TOURS </p><p>HERE.  ANH WAS GIVEN INCREASED PROMINENCE IMMEDIATELY FOR </p><p>SEVERAL REASONS: HE JUMPED THREE PREVIOUS MEMBERS -- SANG, </p><p>TRA AND ANH -- IN PRECEDENCE TO NINTH OF 15, AND HE WAS </p><p>SINGLED OUT DURING OTHER PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENTS AT THE </p><p>CLOSING AS WELL.  HE WILL HEAD THE NINE-MEMBER CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE INSPECTORATE, AND HE WAS LISTED SECOND TO MANH </p><p>AMONG THE NINE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE NEW POLITBURO </p><p>SECRETARIAT (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW).  ANH, WHO WAS BORN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IN 1949 IN KIEN GIANG PROVINCE IN THE SOUTH, WILL BE AMONG </p><p>THE YOUNGEST POLITBURO MEMBERS.  UNTIL 1997 HE SERVED AS </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE CPV PARTY COMMITTEE IN KIEN GIANG.  IN 1997 </p><p>HE WAS NAMED VICE CHAIR OF THE CPV CONTROL COMMISSION, </p><p>MOVING UP TO THE TOP SPOT THIS WEEKEND.  HE HAS BEEN A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE SINCE 1996.  THE SWEDISH </p><p>DCM, WHO HAS MET HIM SEVERAL TIMES, SAYS HE IS A STRONG </p><p>ORGANIZER, AN "APPARATCHIK" WHO WILL FOLLOW ORDERS RATHER </p><p>THAN AN IDEOLOGUE.  SHE SAYS HE HAS A GOOD TRACK RECORD AND </p><p>HAS MOVED UP QUICKLY IN CPV RANKS. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) DUOC, A REFORMER FROM DANANG, CAME UP THROUGH THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00965  04 OF 05  231116Z </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IN DANANG RISING TO PARTY BOSS THERE. </p><p>HE MOVED TO HEAD MASS MOBILIZATION A YEAR AGO WHEN DIEN WAS </p><p>MOVED TO DANANG AND TRIET MOVED TO HCMC FROM THE MASS </p><p>MOBILIZATION SLOT.  (TRADITIONALLY THE HEAD OF MASS </p><p>MOBILIZATION IS IN THE POLITBURO.)  THE SWEDISH DCM HAS MET </p><p>HIM TWICE AND IS IMPRESSED WITH HIS COMMAND OF HIS </p><p>PORTFOLIO AND HIS REFORMIST BENT. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) HOAN, 61, HAS SERVED AS "CHIEF OF STAFF" AT THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE OFFICE SINCE JANUARY 1998.  FROM HAI HUNG </p><p>PROVINCE IN THE NORTH, HOAN WORKED FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES </p><p>IN LABOR ISSUES AFTER RECEIVING A MASTER\'S IN ECONOMICS </p><p>FROM HUNGARY IN 1980.  HE SERVED AS HEAD OF THE INSTITUTE </p><p>OF LABOR AFFAIRS AND THEN AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT MOLISA </p><p>(1981) AND DIRECTOR OF THE GENERAL ORGANIZATIONAL DEPT </p><p>THERE (1983).  HE BECAME VICE MINISTER OF LABOR IN 1987 AND </p><p>MINISTER IN 1987, SERVING FOR THE NEXT DECADE.  HE IS </p><p>MARRIED WITH TWO GROWN SONS.  ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES AT MOLISA </p><p>(STRICTLY PROTECT) DESCRIBED HIM AS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM AND LABOR REFORMS, AND HE IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>BOOST THESE ISSUES ON THE SECRETARIAT.  AS HEAD OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE OFFICE, HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST VOCAL IN </p><p>THE RECENT CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS CALLING FOR PHIEU TO </p><p>STEP DOWN, ACCORDING TO AN EDITOR OF "THE PEOPLE\'S ARMY" </p><p>NEWSPAPER.  (ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE, LE HONG ANH WAS ALSO </p><p>VOCAL IN THIS REGARD.) </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) DIEM, 58, HAS SERVED AS MINISTER OF CULTURE SINCE </p><p>NOVEMBER 1996.  FROM HUE CITY, HE STUDIED IN HANOI, </p><p>"PARTICIPATED IN THE WAR IN THE SOUTH OF VIETNAM" FROM </p><p>1965-75 (ACCORDING TO HIS OFFICIAL CV), THEN RETURNED TO </p><p>HUE, RISING TO BE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE THUA THIEN-HUE </p><p>CPV IN 1991.  HE BECAME A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE </p><p>OF THE VIETNAM WRITERS\' UNION AND DEPUTY MINISTER OF </p><p>CULTURE AND INFORMATION IN 1993.  HE IS MARRIED WITH TWO </p><p>DAUGHTERS AND A SON.  THOUGH HIS MINISTRY IS ONE OF THE </p><p>MOST DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH, ESPECIALLY AS IT ENFORCES </p><p>CENSORSHIP RULES, THE SWEDISH DCM FINDS A SILVER LINING IN </p><p>HOW HE PRESIDES OVER THIS HIGHLY IDEOLOGICAL PORTFOLIO. </p><p>PERSONALLY HE IS "OPEN MINDED" AND IS PRAGMATIC WHEN </p><p>RESOLVING THORNY DILEMMAS.  SHE SAID HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN </p><p>THE SWEDES GETTING APPROVAL FOR A CONTROVERSIAL FILM AT THE </p><p>RECENT HANOI FILM FESTIVAL.  BY HIS PORTFOLIO, WE EXPECT </p><p>HIM TO BE INFLUENTIAL IN ENFORCING PROPAGANDA AND </p><p>INFORMATION POLICIES OF THE CPV. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>SECRETARIAT EXPECTED TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00965  05 OF 05  231116Z </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF A NINE-MEMBER SECRETARIAT, </p><p>COMPOSED OF FIVE POLITBURO MEMBERS AND FOUR OTHER CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS, IS EXPECTED TO HELP PROMOTE GREATER </p><p>EFFICIENCY IN CPV LEADERSHIP DECISION-MAKING. ANOTHER </p><p>POSITIVE SIGNAL IS THAT REFORMIST TRADE MINISTER VU KHOAN, </p><p>REPORTEDLY TO BE ELECTED A DEPUTY PM NEXT MONTH, WILL ACT </p><p>AS VIRTUAL "POLITBURO CHIEF OF STAFF" WORKING ON THE NEW </p><p>SECRETARIAT.  (WE WILL REPORT FURTHER SEPTEL ON THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SECRETARIAT.) </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) THE NINE MEMBERS OF THE SECRETARIAT AS ANNOUNCED IN </p><p>PRECEDENCE ORDER ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- NONG DUC MANH </p><p>-- LE HONG ANH </p><p>-- NGUYEN VAN AN </p><p>-- TRAN DINH HOAN </p><p>-- NGUYEN KHOA DIEM </p><p>-- LE VAN DUNG, ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF </p><p>-- MS. TONG THI PHONG, SON LA PROVINCIAL CPV CHIEF </p><p>-- TRUONG VINH TRONG, DONG THAP PROVINCIAL CPV CHIEF </p><p>-- VU KHOAN, MINISTER OF TRADE </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE PERSONNEL AND STRUCTURAL </p><p>CHANGES IN THE CPV\'S SENIOR RANKS LIKELY WILL HELP PROVIDE </p><p>A NEW BOOST FOR THE ECONOMIC REFORM AGENDA.  MANH IS A MORE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00965  05 OF 05  231116Z </p><p>PRAGMATIC, RESULTS-ORIENTED COALITION BUILDER THAN THE </p><p>HIGHLY IDEOLOGICAL AND XENOPHOBIC PHIEU.  THE INCREASED </p><p>DECISION-MAKING CLOUT AND PROMINENCE OF KHAI, TRIET, DUNG </p><p>AND OTHER NEW REFORMERS IN THE LEADERSHIP -- WITHOUT PHIEU </p><p>OR SENIOR ADVISORS GUMMING UP THE WORKS -- SUGGEST THIS </p><p>BODY MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND </p><p>PRODUCTIVELY.  WHILE THE CPV\'S CONSERVATIVE INTERESTS STILL </p><p>ARE REPRESENTED IN THE LEADERSHIP -- HUONG OF MPS, TRONG OF </p><p>THE CPV IDEOLOGUES, TRA OF THE MILITARY -- THEIR PROFILE </p><p>AND CLOUT APPEAR TO BE MUCH LOWER.  THIS IS STILL A </p><p>COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP, OF COURSE, BUT THE BALANCE OF FORCES </p><p>IS MUCH MORE FAVORABLE TO REFORMERS.  WITH A VU KHOAN- </p><p>MANNED SECRETARIAT PLAYING A BIGGER ROLE, WE ARE HOPEFUL </p><p>THIS NEW LINE-UP WILL INDEED LIVE UP TO ITS POTENTIAL.  IN </p><p>ANY EVENT, THIS CONGRESS WAS A KEY VICTORY FOR REFORMERS </p><p>HERE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
