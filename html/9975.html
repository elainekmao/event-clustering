Despite agreement by the Maoists to sit for another round </p><p>of peace talks with the Government of Nepal\'s (GON) </p><p>negotiating team (Ref A), no date has yet been set, and the </p><p>Maoist leadership remains out of the public eye and </p><p>reportedly out of Nepal.  Nepal\'s main political parties </p><p>have once again rejected Prime Minister Surya Bahadur </p><p>Thapa\'s plea to join the peace talks.  Ambushes by Maoist </p><p>cadres killed seven security personnel and injured twenty- </p><p>nine others.  One civilian also was killed.  Maoists have </p><p>warned that the attacks will continue if security forces </p><p>move more than five kilometers from their barracks.  Maoists </p><p>reportedly continue to use the Nepal-India border to smuggle </p><p>in contraband.  Eleven people were abducted by insurgents in </p><p>different parts of Nepal, and the Maoists continue to </p><p>threaten Christian and US affiliated organizations.  The </p><p>insurgents also extorted money from an American volunteer </p><p>Christian development group.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>THIRD ROUND OF DIALOGUE STILL ELUSIVE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Although the Maoists have agreed to sit for another </p><p>round of peace talks, (Ref A) no date has yet been set.  On </p><p>August 5 Kamal Thapa, Minister of Information and </p><p>Communication and member of the GON\'s negotiating team, said </p><p>the GON is ready but the Maoists have not confirmed a date. </p><p>Peace talks facilitators are attempting to establish a date </p><p>before the GON\'s original suggestion of August 15, based on </p><p>Maoist assertions that they want talks "at the earliest." </p><p>Baburam Bhattarai, head of the Maoist negotiating team, </p><p>reportedly told peace talk facilitators on August 7 that the </p><p>Maoists would propose a date within the next few days. </p><p> </p><p>3.  On August 3, Minister Thapa, in response to the Maoists\' </p><p>demand that the GON present its agenda for talks, said the </p><p>agenda would focus on the constitution and not individual </p><p>issues.  He said the GON is "in constant touch with the </p><p>political parties, civil society and government agencies" to </p><p>help frame its agenda, but it is not yet finalized. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES WON\'T PARTICIPATE IN TALKS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The main political parties have rejected Prime Minister </p><p>Thapa\'s plea to participate in the peace talks, announcing </p><p>that they cannot interact with an "unconstitutional </p><p>government."  The Prime Minister had issued a statement on </p><p>August 4 asking for cooperation from all the political </p><p>parties to ensure the success of the peace talks, declaring </p><p>that Nepal is at a "very difficult and decisive phase" after </p><p>suffering irreparable losses.  Leaders of the parties, </p><p>however, rejected the Prime Minister\'s plea, and said they </p><p>will continue their movement against monarchial </p><p>"regression."  Madhav Kumar Nepal, General Secretary of the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), </p><p>said his party welcomes the talks but that the current </p><p>"unconstitutional government" is incapable of dealing with </p><p>the political demands of the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>5.  According to August 3 press accounts, Girija Prasad </p><p>Koirala, President of Nepali Congress, also rejected the </p><p>invitation to party participation from Pushpa Kamal Dahal </p><p>(Prachanda), Maoist Supreme Leader, as nothing more than a </p><p>trick to derail the parties\' movement against the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Padma Ratna Tuladhar and Sailendra Kumar Upadhaya, two </p><p>of the peace talks facilitators, said that the next round of </p><p>talks would be held even without the participation of the </p><p>political parties.  On August 1 Tuladhar quoted Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai, Maoist ideologue and head of the Maoist </p><p>negotiating team, as saying that the third round of talks </p><p>would be held regardless of whether the political parties </p><p>participated.  Upadhaya issued a statement on August 2 </p><p>supporting this position. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS AMBUSH SECURITY FORCES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  Violent attacks by Maoists against security forces in </p><p>the eastern district of Panchthar appear to be on the rise. </p><p>On August 6 one civilian and a Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>soldier were killed in an ambush by insurgents.  Five </p><p>security personnel were killed and twenty-eight were injured </p><p>on August 5 after the truck they were riding in drove over a </p><p>landmine planted by Maoists.  On August 4 in the same </p><p>district, security forces and Maoists exchanged gunfire </p><p>after the insurgents reportedly threw bombs at security </p><p>forces returning from patrol. There were no casualties </p><p>reported.  A Maoist district secretary reportedly threatened </p><p>that the Maoists would "repeat such actions" if government </p><p>forces patrolled beyond five kilometers of their barracks. </p><p>The Home Ministry issued a statement condemning the attacks </p><p>and said "it is a matter of sadness that the Maoists have </p><p>continued such violent activities." </p><p> </p><p>8.  On August 4 in the western district of Dailekh, Maoists </p><p>reportedly threw grenades and opened fire on RNA personnel </p><p>guarding a telecommunications tower.  One female Maoist was </p><p>killed by return fire.  On August 3 in the same district, </p><p>RNA soldiers and insurgents reportedly were involved in a </p><p>confrontation.  Maoists claim they have been ordered to </p><p>attack government troops who go outside five kilometers of </p><p>their barracks.  (Note:  One of the Maoists\' demands has </p><p>been to implement an agreement allegedly reached during the </p><p>second round of peace talks that restricts the RNA to within </p><p>five kilometers of their barracks.  The GON denies even </p><p>agreeing to this and has not complied.  End note). </p><p> </p><p>9.  Two policemen were attacked on August 1 in Nawalparasi </p><p>District while surveying flood damage in the area.  A group </p><p>of Maoists opened fire on them, killing one officer </p><p>instantly, while the other managed to escape. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS USING NEPAL-INDIA BORDER TO IMPORT WEAPONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>10.  According to press reports on August 6, Maoists are </p><p>using the far-western district of Kanchanpur, which borders </p><p>India, to smuggle in weapons and ammunition.  Security </p><p>forces reportedly said the insurgents are using the border </p><p>region to import masses of pipes for use in constructing </p><p>pipe bombs, and are also smuggling in explosives.  Security </p><p>has been increased in the region. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS DEMAND MONEY FROM US VOLUNTEER GROUP </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  On August 2, Maoists in Nuwakot District, immediately </p><p>north of Kathmandu, extorted money from a group of Americans </p><p>assisting in the reconstruction of a school (Ref B).  The </p><p>group of fourteen Americans, twelve of whom are high school </p><p>students, is part of "Global Roots," a Christian volunteer </p><p>program based in Boston.  Maoists in the village of Sirubari </p><p>approached the group and according to the group\'s </p><p>coordinator, they were "forced to pay fees."  The insurgents </p><p>also harangued the group for over an hour, during which they </p><p>professed to hate America and President Bush.  According to </p><p>the coordinator of the group, the Maoists declared that </p><p>"This is our area.  We are in control.  Just like any other </p><p>area you have to pay fees for entering our zone."  Fearing a </p><p>return of the Maoists and demands for higher fees, the group </p><p>terminated the project early and left the area early the </p><p>next morning. </p><p> </p><p>ABDUCTIONS BY MAOISTS CONTINUE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  Maoists continue to violate the ceasefire by abducting </p><p>civilians and security personnel.  On August 3 the </p><p>insurgents reportedly abducted seven civilians in the </p><p>eastern district of Udayapur who were cutting timber.  On </p><p>that same day in Dolakha District, two brothers, one of whom </p><p>is a policeman, were abducted by Maoists.  The officer </p><p>remains missing, but the insurgents released his brother </p><p>after severely beating him.  A group of Maoists in Rauthat </p><p>District abducted a father and son on August 6.  Their </p><p>whereabouts remain unknown. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS WARN AGAINST CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  On August 6 Maoists in the districts of Nuwakot, </p><p>Sindhupalchowk and Rasuwa, all immediately north of </p><p>Kathmandu, issued a joint statement warning of action </p><p>against USAID for "unnecessarily influencing Nepalis in the </p><p>name of Christianity."  The insurgents oppose the conversion </p><p>of Hindus to Christianity and have accused USAID of </p><p>attracting over five thousand Hindus to Christianity.  In </p><p>Nuwakot the Maoists reportedly already have banned all </p><p>Christian organizations, accusing them of using the guise of </p><p>religion to support "US backed elements." </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
