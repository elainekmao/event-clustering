<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004382 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: JULY 11 REACTIONS TO IRAQ INCIDENT </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: sensationalist reporting on the July 4 </p><p>detentions of Turkish Special Forces (TSF) by U.S. troops </p><p>continued to fade in the July 11 Turkish press, with the </p><p>incident pushed off the front pages in several major dailies. </p><p> Ultra-nationalists, advocating a "reevaluation" of the </p><p>bilateral relationship, continue publicly and privately to </p><p>use harsh rhetoric in support of military hard-liners, and to </p><p>demand a U.S. apology.  Nevertheless, despite the rhetoric, </p><p>since the return of the detainees to Turkish custody, we have </p><p>not seen any steps towards a break in dialogue or diminution </p><p>of relations including on commercial military (or </p><p>non-military) deals.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. Unapologetic, AK "Rational" </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The front page of the July 11 mainstream mass daily </p><p>"Hurriyet" reports that General Sylvester, during the meeting </p><p>of the joint fact-finding commission, acknowledged that the </p><p>incident was "not a pleasant one," but added that he was "not </p><p>in a position to apologize." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- "Hurriyet" theorized that General Sylvester decided to go </p><p>to northern Iraq only after hearing the reports about the </p><p>incident presented by the Turks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Mainstream "Sabah" quotes Lieutenant General Koksal </p><p>Karabay, head of the Turkish team, as saying the incident was </p><p>"a scandal, no matter what the reason" for the U.S. action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Papers highlighted statements by F.M. Gul and P.M. </p><p>Erdogan that were measured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Gul asserted that Turkish forces "were not involved in a </p><p>secret mission," and said that the evidence presented by the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>United States thus far was "not persuasive." He added that </p><p>there was "no chance" that the TSF were operating "outside of </p><p>the chain of command of the Turkish Armed Forces."  Gul </p><p>claimed that Turkey wants to "work for stability in northern </p><p>Iraq."  He said that the discussions of the fact-finding team </p><p>were proceeding "based on mutual trust," and predicted that </p><p>"everything will come out" once the commission has completed </p><p>its work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In his monthly television address to the nation July 10, </p><p>Erdogan described the government\'s approach to the incident </p><p>as one of "uncompromising realism and determination."  He </p><p>reiterated his earlier assertion that the incident was </p><p>"ugly"; he also lashed out at those who had criticized the </p><p>Government for not reacting more forcefully against the USG. </p><p>Erdogan asserted that the state administration must act "not </p><p>by emotional reaction," but through "determined and rational </p><p>steps."  On July 11, he also reminded T.V. reporters that the </p><p>mil/mil commission had not yet reached any conclusions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Major commentators were generally moderate. </p><p>"Hurriyet\'s" Ferai Tinc, who has frequently criticized U.S. </p><p>policies in Iraq, stressed the importance of U.S.-Turkish </p><p>coordination and urged the two sides to reestablish trust </p><p>between them.  Tinc pointed out that a continued lack of </p><p>coordination in Iraq,s restructuring will only strengthen </p><p>the region,s terrorists.  Fehmi Koru, a strong U.S. critic </p><p>in the Islam-oriented "Yeni Safak," stressed the need to </p><p>restore a "healthy" relationship between Turkey and the </p><p>United States.  Koru urged F.M. Gul to carry through on his </p><p>planned visit to Washington in coming weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Pro-Military MHP: "Strategic Partnership is Over..." </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Vice Chairman for the ultra-nationalist MHP Ercument </p><p>Konukman asserted to us July 11 that the alleged treatment of </p><p>Turkish soldiers at the hands of U.S. forces was </p><p>"unacceptable" and demanded that the USG apologize publicly. </p><p>He suggested that the Kurds were beneath the Turks and thus </p><p>not fit subjects for U.S. protection.  Konukman also strongly </p><p>intimated that members of the MHP\'s "idealist" cadres (note: </p><p>the notorious "Ulkuculer") are assisting/working with Turkish </p><p>military in n. Iraq.  The Turkish military, he said, is </p><p>following the same policy in n. Iraq that it has followed for </p><p>the last decade; it does not trust the US to protect Turkey\'s </p><p>interests.  MHP believes Turkey must "reevaluate" its </p><p>relationship with the U.S., he added.  "I\'m sorry," Konukman </p><p>said.  "The Strategic Partnership is over." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>...But Commercial Dialogue Unaffected So Far </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Despite calls in the press earlier this week for </p><p>Turkey to to take firm measures including canceling its </p><p>purchase of 4 AWACs planes from Boeing and reports in </p><p>yesterday\'s "Milliyet" that the TGS had been "boycotting" </p><p>talks on the purchase of King Cobra attack helicopters since </p><p>July 7 (they were, but since the return of Turkish Special </p><p>Forces to Turkish custody are now again participating) there </p><p>is nothing to suggest a break in dialogue on commercial </p><p>military (or non-military) deals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment:  The military probably is trying as hard as </p><p>it can to avoid using these defense contracts as a political </p><p>tool since any setback could open up the fenced defense </p><p>procurement funds to claims by AK politicians (including the </p><p>P.M.) who want the money for social programs.  It is worth </p><p>also noting that the GOT yesterday proposed holding the next </p><p>meeting of the Economic Partnership Commission in October, a </p><p>sign that they want to continue dialogue. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
