<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIJING 001019 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/05/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: HU JINTAO IN THE MEDIA LIMELIGHT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIJING 585 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY JON ALOISI, POLITICAL MINISTER- </p><p>COUNSELOR.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) CHINESE MEDIA ARE GIVING INCREASING PROMINENCE </p><p>TO HU JINTAO IN A CLEAR SIGNAL TO CHINA\'S DOMESTIC </p><p>AUDIENCE THAT HE HAS CONSOLIDATED HIS POSITION AS </p><p>CHINA\'S NEXT PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY AND STATE </p><p>PRESIDENT.  WE EXPECT HU\'S PUBLIC PROFILE TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>RISE AS CHINA MOVES CLOSER TO THE 2002/2203 LEADERSHIP </p><p>TRANSITION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBER AND STATE </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT HU JINTAO IS WIDELY EXPECTED TO REPLACE </p><p>JIANG ZEMIN AS PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY (AT THIS FALL\'S </p><p>16TH PARTY CONGRESS) AND STATE PRESIDENT (DURING THE </p><p>MARCH 2003 10TH NATIONAL PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS).  OVER </p><p>RECENT WEEKS, CHINESE MEDIA HAVE INCREASED THEIR </p><p>COVERAGE OF HU\'S ACTIVITIES.  A YEAR AGO, PRESS COVERAGE </p><p>OF HU, WHO RANKS FIFTH IN THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP, </p><p>FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON HIS ACTIVITIES AS PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL.  TODAY\'S COVERAGE IS MUCH MORE </p><p>LIKELY TO PORTRAY HU IN LEADING ROLES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) WHILE CHINA\'S STATE-RUN MEDIA HAS NOT ALTERED THE </p><p>FORMAL ORDER DICTATING THAT COVERAGE OF HU COMES AFTER </p><p>THAT OF JIANG ZEMIN, ZHU RONGJI, LI PENG AND LI RUIHUAN, </p><p>HU JINTAO\'S INCREASINGLY PROMINENT ROLE IS CLEAR IN THE </p><p>CONTENT AND LENGTH OF HIS COVERAGE.  THE AUTHORITATIVE </p><p>FEBRUARY 4 TV EVENING NEWS BROADCAST, FOR EXAMPLE, BEGAN </p><p>WITH A SEVEN-MINUTE REPORT ON HU\'S SPEECH -- </p><p>REPRESENTING THE PARTY\'S CENTER, THE STATE COUNCIL AND </p><p>THE CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION -- AT A SPRING FESTIVAL </p><p>RECEPTION FOR HUNDREDS OF RETIRED SENIOR CADRES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) A REVIEW OF THE OFFICIAL PRINT AND BROADCAST </p><p>MEDIA OVER THE PAST MONTH CONFIRMS THAT HU\'S ACTIVITIES </p><p>ARE APPEARING MORE FREQUENTLY AND PLACED MORE </p><p>PROMINENTLY.  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, HU HAS </p><p>BEEN REPORTED MAKING APPEARANCES AND "IMPORTANT </p><p>SPEECHES" AT A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT OCCASIONS.  THESE </p><p>INCLUDE HIS "IMPORTANT SPEECH" JANUARY 11 TO THE </p><p>NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PARTY PROPAGANDA CHIEFS (JIANG </p><p>MADE THE KEYNOTE SPEECH IN 2001) AND HIS JANUARY 21 </p><p>MEETING WITH PROMINENT AMERICAN VISITORS -- HIS FIRST </p><p>SUCH ENCOUNTER (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) FURTHER REFLECTING HIS ELEVATED STATUS, HU </p><p>RECEIVED TOP-RANK BILLING AT THE JANUARY 25 CONFERENCE </p><p>COMMEMORATING THE SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF JIANG\'S "EIGHT- </p><p>POINT PROPOSAL" (WHERE QIAN QICHEN PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS </p><p>TO CHINA\'S CROSS-STRAIT POLICY).  HE ALSO PARTICIPATED - </p><p>- ALONGSIDE JIANG -- IN A FEBRUARY 2 CENTRAL MILITARY </p><p>COMMISSION RECEPTION HONORING RETIRED MILITARY CADRES </p><p>AND WAS "IN CHARGE" AT CEREMONY THAT SAME DAY JOINTLY </p><p>SPONSORED BY THE PARTY AND THE STATE COUNCIL HONORING </p><p>OUTSTANDING SCIENTISTS. </p><p></p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WHILE CHINA HAS MOVED QUITE FAR BEYOND THE DAYS </p><p>WHEN ANALYSTS POURED OVER PICTURES IN THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY </p><p>TO PUZZLE OUT LEADERSHIP TRENDS, THE REGIME REMAINS </p><p>SURPRISINGLY RIGID IN ITS MEDIA TREATMENT OF ITS </p><p>LEADERS.  FOR DAILY VIEWERS OF THE CHINESE-LANGUAGE </p><p>NEWS, HU\'S RISE IN STATURE IS A CLEAR INDICATION THAT </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP TRANSITION IS PROCEEDING ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>EXPECTED PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>RANDT </p><p></p></div>
