<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001541 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 8/21/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CE, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  President meeting with JVP leads to much </p><p>speculation; most observers see no lasting PA-JVP pact </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Colombo 1450 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The President recently met with the JVP </p><p>in what many saw as a move to thwart the UNF peace </p><p>initiatives.  PA representatives and other observers </p><p>state the meetings between the President and JVP were </p><p>simply a show of strength.  The upcoming no confidence </p><p>vote against a UNF Minister might be the first test of </p><p>that strength.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On August 9, President Kumaratunga met with the </p><p>leader of the radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) </p><p>Tilvin Silva.  The meeting elicited strong responses </p><p>from Tamil politicians who described the talks as a </p><p>threat to the peace process.  MP G.G. Ponnambalam of the </p><p>Tamil National Alliance (TNA) stated that her meeting </p><p>with the JVP proves that when the President "talks of </p><p>building a pluralistic society it is merely lip </p><p>service."  According to him, working with the Sinhala- </p><p>nationalist JVP shows that the President has no </p><p>credibility.  MP T. Thangavadivel summarized the TNA </p><p>response when he said the PA and JVP working together is </p><p>a "rotten alliance." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Presidential Spokesman Harim Peiris countered by </p><p>describing the meeting, and subsequent discussions, as </p><p>simple political posturing in hopes of staving off </p><p>possible snap elections (see Reftel).  He asserted that </p><p>the PA had no desire to coordinate policy with the JVP. </p><p>A secondary reason for the meeting, he asserted, was to </p><p>show the United National Front (UNF) that the President </p><p>would not accede to their demands on a range of issues </p><p>without a fight. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Some political observers believe any agreement </p><p>between the JVP and PA can only be of a limited nature, </p><p>because of the adverse effects any such alliance would </p><p>have within and on the PA.  Kingsley Rodrigo, Executive </p><p>Director of PAFFREL, a NGO promoting democratic reform, </p><p>stated that a true alliance between Kumaratunga and </p><p>Silva would result in a number of PA MPs\' abandoning </p><p>their party.  Kethesh Loganathan of the Center for </p><p>Policy Alternatives (CPA) believes that any joint </p><p>efforts by the JVP and PA will be only for election </p><p>purposes:  too many people in the party do not trust the </p><p>JVP.  Loganathan emphasized that the single largest </p><p>reason for the unwillingness of many PA MPs to work with </p><p>JVP is that the electorate wants peace and the JVP has </p><p>taken a strong anti-peace process stance. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Referring to a possible alliance between the PA </p><p>and JVP, General Secretary of the UNF Senarath </p><p>Kapukotuwa claimed that the first test of any such </p><p>relationship would be the PA-sponsored no confidence </p><p>bill against Minister of Interior John Amaratunge. </p><p>Kapukotuwa claimed that the Kumaratunga meeting with </p><p>Silva was an attempt to show strength, but the </p><p>reluctance of some PA members to speak against </p><p>Amaratunge is the true indicator of the PA\'s weakness. </p><p>Observers such as Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Executive </p><p>Director of the CPA, agreed with the assessment that the </p><p>events leading up to the vote on the no-confidence bill </p><p>will give some indication of the strength of each side </p><p>going into the debate over a constitutional amendment </p><p>designed to limit the President\'s powers. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
