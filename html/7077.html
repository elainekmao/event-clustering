<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002170 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY APRIL 3:  MARKETS LIKE SECRETARY\'S </p><p>VISIT, BUT STILL WARY OF AK </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Well Timed Market Bounce From Secretary\'s Visit </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Positive local press coverage of the Secretary\'s </p><p>April 3 visit translated into a modest bounce in local </p><p>financial markets, well timed in advance of key large April 8 </p><p>debt auctions.  Market analysts told us the Secretary\'s </p><p>affirmation of the bilateral relationship was helpful to </p><p>general sentiment.   The lira strengthened about one percent </p><p>in morning trading to TL 1,675,000 to the dollar.  T-bill </p><p>yields dropped nearly two percentage points to 63 percent </p><p>compounded.  The Istanbul Stock Exchange rose 2.2 percent in </p><p>morning trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On April 3, Deputy Treasury U/S Hakan Ozyildiz </p><p>explained Treasury\'s strategy for the April 8 debt auctions. </p><p> IMF management had approved the LOI on evening of April 2; </p><p>MinState Babacan and Treasury U/S Oztrak were in Istanbul </p><p>meeting with banks and would coordinate with the Central Bank </p><p>on signing the LOI.  Treasury would let the local banks </p><p>digest the good news of the LOI signing, and then check on </p><p>their appetites for new T-bill instruments.  Once Treasury </p><p>had updated feedback from the local banks, it would announce </p><p>the bills to be issued on April 8.  Ozyildiz foresees issuing </p><p>two lira T-bills, both a short and longer-term maturity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Market Sentiment Towards AK Remains Negative </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Treasury Deputy U/S Ozyildiz (protect) added that </p><p>despite the good news of U.S. and IMF support, markets remain </p><p>highly skeptical of AK\'s intentions of implementing economic </p><p>reforms.  He also noted recent unhelpful press rumors of </p><p>imminent changes at Treasury (e.g., Finance Minister </p><p>Unakitan\'s comment that Treasury might be folded into the </p><p>Finance Ministry; ongoing press speculation that U/S Oztrak </p><p>will be replaced).  Comment:  Ozyildiz\'s view is not </p><p>objective, since he might be replaced if Oztrak goes. </p><p>However, he is accurately summing up  market attitudes </p><p>towards AK.  Recent state bank and state energy company </p><p>personnel changes (septel on latter) have done nothing to </p><p>dispel such attitudes.  As one Turkish investor told us, </p><p>Babacan\'s mid-March statements intentionally misleading </p><p>markets about the status of the original U.S. package would </p><p>in other countries have led to criminal charges.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Negative feelings for AK notwithstanding, market </p><p>participants tell us they plan to roll-over the debt on April </p><p>8.  Looking beyond the April debt auctions, the key problem </p><p>is the ongoing high real interest rates (about 32 percent) </p><p>demanded for such roll-overs.   Given the short maturity of </p><p>the TL debt, these real rates require Turkish banks to </p><p>maintain and increase if possible their current liquidity </p><p>levels.  At present, it appears that many banks do have extra </p><p>lira liquidity, sitting in the money markets, that could be </p><p>used to roll-over the ever increasing amount of T-bills.  But </p><p>F/X liquidity has recently been a problem for Turkish banks </p><p>(liquidity is fungible).  And reducing real rates, dependent </p><p>on the GOT restoring confidence via strongly implementing </p><p>reforms, may take months, if it happens at all.  In this </p><p>atmosphere of uncertainty and lack of confidence in the GOT, </p><p>maintaining the inter-bank lines of credit will be critical </p><p>to GOT solvency. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
