End summary. </p><p> </p><p>SECOND ROUND OF TALKS SCHEDULED </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Negotiators representing the GON and the Maoists meet on </p><p>May 9 for the second round of peace talks.  Krishna Bahadur </p><p>Mahara, Maoist spokesman and team member, said the Maoists </p><p>do not have a new agenda, but are hopeful that the GON will </p><p>respond to the demands put forth in the first round of </p><p>talks.  These demands include a round-table conference, </p><p>Maoist leadership in a new interim government, constituent </p><p>assembly, withdrawal of cases against Maoist cadres, and </p><p>demobilization of armed forces.  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister </p><p>of Physical Planning and Works and government negotiator, </p><p>told reporters on May 6 that details of the GON\'s agenda </p><p>would emerge on the day of the talks. </p><p> </p><p>SUPPORT FOR PEACE TALKS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Keith Bloomfield, Ambassador of the United Kingdom (UK) </p><p>to Nepal, said the UK is ready to facilitate peace talks and </p><p>assist in maintaining security in Nepal.  Speaking at a </p><p>program on May 6, Bloomfield said the UK favored a </p><p>constitutional monarchy and respect for human rights. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Wu Congyong, the Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, also </p><p>voiced support for the peace talks at a May 8 interaction on </p><p>China\'s foreign policy.  Congyong said that China would not </p><p>interfere with Nepal\'s "internal affairs," and said he was </p><p>confident in the ability of the Nepali people to solve the </p><p>current crisis.  Congyong said maintaining peace and </p><p>stability would be beneficial to Nepal\'s economy and </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST LEADERS BLAST U.S. FOR TERRORIST LABEL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Maoist leaders have condemned the listing of their party </p><p>on a terrorist watch list in the annual "Patterns of Global </p><p>Terrorism" report, released on April 30 by the Secretary of </p><p>State and the Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism.   In a </p><p>press release issued on May 7 Prachanda, Maoist supreme </p><p>leader, said the U.S. was trying to disrupt the peace talks </p><p>and interfering with Nepal\'s internal affairs.  He said the </p><p>U.S. was attempting to hatch a conspiracy against the talks, </p><p>and lashed out at the "repeated verbal attacks" on the </p><p>Maoists by the U.S. Ambassador to Nepal.  The Maoist </p><p>Chairman also accused the U.S. of trying to further its own </p><p>interests in Nepal in order to extend its influence over all </p><p>of South Asia. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Baburam Bhattarai, chief negotiator of the Maoist </p><p>negotiating team, also criticized the Maoists\' placement on </p><p>the terrorist watch list.  On May 7 Bhattarai reportedly </p><p>said the action would have serious and far-reaching effects </p><p>on Nepal.  He surmised that the peace talks were being </p><p>"hijacked by foreign capitals," and warned that such actions </p><p>would turn Nepal into a battlefield.  In a separate </p><p>interview on May 8 with a vernacular newspaper, Bhattarai </p><p>continued his attacks on the U.S., saying America was "a </p><p>dangerous force and hurdle in the talks."  The Maoist </p><p>ideologue, echoing Prachanda, also accused the U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Nepal of making threats against Nepal. </p><p>Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman and talk team </p><p>member, urged the U.S. to revoke the decision. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Keith Bloomfield, Ambassador of the United Kingdom (UK) </p><p>to Nepal, told the local press that his government has not </p><p>labeled the Maoists as terrorists because their activities </p><p>do not substantially threaten the UK.  (Note:  It is </p><p>interesting to note that Prachanda\'s brother reportedly is </p><p>studying at the University of Riding in London). </p><p> </p><p>RNA WARNS MAOISTS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) reportedly warned the Maoists </p><p>on May 6 that they would pay "a big price" if they withdrew </p><p>from peace talks.  A vernacular publication said the RNA </p><p>claimed that it is now equipped with better, more modern </p><p>weapons, and had received additional training.  Bhattarai </p><p>dismissed the boasts and said any weapons the RNA obtained </p><p>from the U.S. would soon be stolen by the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Madhav Nepal, General Secretary of the Communist Party </p><p>of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) accused both the </p><p>GON and the Maoists of storing weapons and preparing for </p><p>war.  Nepal, addressing a CPN-UML convention on May 6, said </p><p>both sides were trying to amass military strength while his </p><p>party was cooperating with the peace process.  CPN-UML is </p><p>one of five political parties which launched a "peoples\' </p><p>movement" against the King, and which Nepal claims is aimed </p><p>at strengthening the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF MAOIST CASES POSSIBLE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  A vernacular publication quoted an anonymous source at </p><p>the Home Ministry as saying that efforts were being made to </p><p>withdraw cases against Maoist cadres.  According to the </p><p>source, all District Administration Offices (DAO) have been </p><p>instructed to supply data relating to Maoist detainees. </p><p>After all of the data is received, the cases will be </p><p>reviewed for possible withdrawal of charges.  Mahara </p><p>criticized the GON for delaying the release of Maoist </p><p>cadres, and said he would take the matter up again at </p><p>Friday\'s round of peace talks.  The official at the Home </p><p>Ministry cautioned that even if the recommendations are made </p><p>to withdraw the cases, it is up to the individual courts to </p><p>follow through. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Thirteen Maoist cadres were released this week from </p><p>jails in the districts of Terhathum, Makwanpur, Taplejung </p><p>and Lamjung. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST CRIMES CONTINUE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Maoist insurgents continued to violate the ceasefire, </p><p>abducting two Village Development Committee (VDC) members in </p><p>the districts of Dailekh and Makwanpur.  Three journalists, </p><p>including two women, were also abducted in the far western </p><p>district of Kalikot on May 7.  The journalists, who were on </p><p>a reporting assignment, managed to escape.  Insurgents in </p><p>the eastern Terai district of Rauthat severely beat two </p><p>civilians who could not provide monetary donations to the </p><p>Maoists, and also beat three people, including a Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) worker, </p><p>after they protested the destruction of a house by the </p><p>insurgents.  Five civilians who reportedly were abducted </p><p>from Taplejung District several weeks ago have allegedly </p><p>been severely bludgeoned by their Maoist captors.  Relatives </p><p>are pleading for their release.  Family members of a former </p><p>VDC Chief abducted a week ago are also appealing to the </p><p>Maoists for his release, and have sought help from local </p><p>human rights organizations. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Maoists in the mid-western hill district of Dailekh </p><p>have forced local villagers to abandon traditional festivals </p><p>and celebrations, including song and dance, and ordered them </p><p>to mark the February 13 launch date of the "People\'s War." </p><p>The insurgents, who control the majority of the district, </p><p>have forced villagers to observe Maoist festivals and </p><p>abandon other practices.  The Maoists said the new culture </p><p>eliminates the practice of "untouchability." </p><p> </p><p>14.  The Maoist insurgency has forced the Rautes, an </p><p>indigenous ethnic community in the far-western district of </p><p>Dadeldhura, to flee to the jungle.  The families claim that </p><p>Maoists tortured them in the day while security forces </p><p>harassed them at night.  They remain in the jungle, doubtful </p><p>of the success of the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Villagers in the mid-western Rolpa District, however, </p><p>have defied the Maoists in order to attend Government- </p><p>sponsored health camps.  Insurgents in the district had </p><p>ordered the locals not to attend the camps, and asked the </p><p>team of medics, consisting of army and police personnel, to </p><p>leave, accusing them of violating the ceasefire.  The </p><p>insurgents, who have a stronghold on the region, said they </p><p>wanted the areas to remain "enemy free."  Maoist cadres also </p><p>tried to disrupt similar health camps in Salyan and Dang </p><p>Districts by limiting water supplies to the medics, and </p><p>attempting to stop people from seeking treatment. </p><p> </p><p>ANNISU-R THREATENS SCHOOLS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  The All Nepal National Independent Students\' Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist affiliated student </p><p>group, has threatened protests against private schools that </p><p>do not reduce their tuition rates.  Kabi Gautam, Secretary </p><p>of ANNISU-R, said that the action is being taken at the </p><p>request of parents, and because the private schools are </p><p>cheating students and parents.  Lhundub Dorji Lama, </p><p>President of National Private and Boarding Schools </p><p>Association Nepal (PABSON), warned that the schools would </p><p>defy the protests, declaring that it was impossible to </p><p>conduct classes with the constant interference by student </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
