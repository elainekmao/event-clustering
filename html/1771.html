<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 CAIRO 003757 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2005 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PGOV, PTER, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: EGYPT\'S MUSLIM BROTHERS - PART 2: A POPULAR </p><p>POLITICAL FORCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: CAIRO 3303 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM RENO HARNISH FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) IN THIS, THE SECOND OF TWO CABLES ON EGYPT\'S MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD (MB), WE LOOK AT THE BANNED MOVEMENT\'S POPULARITY </p><p>AND ITS SOURCES.  DESPITE INTERNAL TENSIONS AND IMPRISONMENT </p><p>OF THE MOST DYNAMIC OF ITS YOUNG LEADERS SINCE THE </p><p>MID-1990\'S, THE MB HAS ENJOYED AN UPSURGE IN POPULARITY, </p><p>WINNING 17 PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY (PA) SEATS IN THE FALL 2000 </p><p>ELECTIONS AND A RETURN TO THE BOARD OF THE BAR SYNDICATE IN </p><p>FEBRUARY ELECTIONS.  REASONS FOR THEIR POPULARITY ARE MANY; </p><p>AMONG THEM ARE PERCEPTIONS THAT THEY ARE NOT CORRUPT, THEY </p><p>ARE THE ONLY REAL POLITICAL OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AND THAT THEY HAVE AN </p><p>EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION AND DISCIPLINED MEMBERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) PUBLIC OUTREACH TO ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS HAS </p><p>INCREASED MB POPULARITY WHICH IS STRONGEST AMONG THE POOR. </p><p>BUT THEY ARE NOT UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED.  INTELLECTUALS - </p><p>WHETHER SECULAR OR RELIGIOUS - MISTRUST THE GROUP AND </p><p>QUESTION ITS POLITICAL VIABILITY IN A DEMOCRACY AND ITS </p><p>RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS.  DETRACTORS CLAIM THERE IS CORRUPTION </p><p>WITHIN MB RANKS AND CONTINUE TO SUSPECT THAT IT HAS A </p><p>CAPACITY FOR VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MB INDEPENDENTS ELECTED TO THE PA LAST FALL TRIED </p><p>BRIEFLY TO COEXIST WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT THE EFFORT WAS </p><p>SHORT-LIVED.  IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THE MB HAVE TAKEN ON </p><p>KEY GOVERNMENT MINISTERS DURING PA SESSIONS AND HAVE AROUSED </p><p>PUBLIC SENTIMENT WITH THEIR STRONG ANTI-GOVERNMENT POSITIONS </p><p>ON DOMESTIC AND REGIONAL ISSUES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING </p><p>TO ISRAEL AND STRIDENT SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIANS.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED, MAKING CLEAR THAT IT, NOT THE MB, </p><p>IS SETTING THE POLITICAL AGENDA.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>POPULAR REACTIONS TO THE MB </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DESPITE GOVERNMENT REPRESSION AND THEIR OWN INTERNAL </p><p>PROBLEMS (SEE REFTEL) IN RECENT YEARS, EGYPT\'S MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERS (MB) ARE ENJOYING AN UPSURGE IN POPULARITY.  THEIR </p><p>SUCCESS IN THE FALL 2000 PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY (PA) ELECTIONS, </p><p>ALBEIT AS INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES, AND IN THE LAWYERS\' </p><p>SYNDICATE ELECTIONS IN FEBRUARY, ATTEST TO THIS.  DESPITE AN </p><p>INTENSIVE CAMPAIGN OF ARRESTS AND HARASSMENT, OF 40 MB </p><p>INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES FOR THE PA, 17 WON SEATS.  IN THE </p><p>LAWYERS\' SYNDICATE ELECTIONS MB CANDIDATES WON 8 OF 24 SEATS </p><p>ON THE BOARD.  IN AN ERA OF PERCEIVED VAST CORRUPTION, HIGH </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT, UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND PRIVILEGES, </p><p>AND OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, THE MB ARE GAINING GROUND.  MANY </p><p>EGYPTIANS SYMPATHIZE WITH THE SIMPLE, DIRECT MESSAGE, "ISLAM </p><p>IS THE SOLUTION," AS WELL AS WITH THE IMAGES IT PROJECTS </p><p>REGARDING ITS PURITY OF RELIGIOUS VALUES AND THE PROVISION OF </p><p> SOCIAL SERVICES.  ACCORDING TO ITS LEADERS, THE MB ADVOCATE </p><p>STRONGER ISLAMIC INFLUENCE IN SOCIETY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. </p><p>INTERESTED IN THE COMMON WELFARE OF THE AVERAGE EGYPTIAN, </p><p>THEY PROJECT THEMSELVES AND ARE PERCEIVED BY MANY AS THE </p><p>ANTITHESIS OF A CORRUPT, WEALTHY, SECULAR RULING ELITE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHILE MANY, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE POOREST, BELIEVE </p><p>THE MB SINCERE IN ITS OBJECTIVES, MANY ISLAMIST AND SECULAR </p><p>INTELLECTUALS WITH WHOM WE SPOKE BELIEVE THE SIMPLICITY OF </p><p>THEIR MESSAGE CONCEALS A POLICY VACUUM AT BEST, OR NEFARIOUS </p><p>INTENTIONS AT WORST.  ANTI-MB INTELLECTUALS CLAIM THAT THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION IS POISED AT ANY OPPORTUNE MOMENT TO USE </p><p>VIOLENCE TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES.  TOO LITTLE, THEY SAY, IS </p><p>KNOWN ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION\'S STRUCTURE AND POLITICS (SEE </p><p>REFTEL).  FOR INSTANCE, WHO ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE MB </p><p>GOVERNING BOARD AND WHAT DECISIONS ARE THEY MAKING?  LITTLE </p><p>IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF ITS MEMBERSHIP AND </p><p>LESS ABOUT THEIR STRATEGY FOR SPREADING MB INFLUENCE AND </p><p>IDEAS IN EGYPTIAN SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>THE ONLY OPPOSITION IN TOWN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AFTER THE GOVERNMENT\'S TARGETING OF THE MB IN 1994 </p><p>AND 1995, THE ORGANIZATION EFFECTIVELY WENT UNDERGROUND UNTIL </p><p>2000 WHEN SOME OF THE TOP YOUNG LEADERS WERE RELEASED FROM </p><p>PRISON.  ONE ACADEMIC ARGUED THAT THE MB HAD TO SHOW ITS FACE </p><p>TO SURVIVE.  "THEY HAD NO CHOICE.  THEY NEEDED TO PROVE THAT </p><p>THE CRACKDOWN HAS NOT BROKEN THEM AND THAT THEY CONTINUE TO </p><p>EXIST AS A VIABLE MOVEMENT."  DESPITE THE PRE-ELECTION </p><p>CRACKDOWN, THE MB PROVIDED DISCIPLINED SUPPORT TO ITS </p><p>CANDIDATES IN THE FALL 2000 PA ELECTIONS, UNLIKE OTHER </p><p>PARTIES INCLUDING THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (NDP). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE MB\'S INFLUENCE WAS AMPLIFIED BY THE LACK OF A </p><p>SECULAR OPPOSITION POLITICAL MOVEMENT IN EGYPT WHICH </p><p>CONSTITUTED A CREDIBLE POLITICAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE RULING </p><p>PARTY AT ELECTION TIME.  ACADEMICS ESTIMATE THE POLITICALLY </p><p>ACTIVE SECTOR OF THIS SOCIETY RANGES BETWEEN 2-8%, DEPENDING </p><p>UPON THE TIME (E.G. ELECTIONS) AND THE ISSUE (E.G. </p><p>CORRUPTION).  IN THE FALL 2000 PA ELECTIONS, MB CANDIDATES </p><p>CAPTURED THE POPULAR TIDE OF VOTES AGAINST THE (RULING) NDP </p><p>IN THE SMALL NUMBER OF DISTRICTS WHERE THEY FIELDED </p><p>CANDIDATES.  DESPITE MANY ARRESTS, HARSH TREATMENT OF MB </p><p>MEMBERS AND SYMPATHIZERS AND ITS STATUS AS AN ILLEGAL PARTY, </p><p>THE 40 MB CANDIDATES RUNNING AS "INDEPENDENTS" MANAGED TO WIN </p><p>17 PA SEATS.  THEY RECENTLY CINCHED ONE-THIRD (8) OF THE </p><p>BOARD SEATS IN THE EGYPTIAN BAR SYNDICATE IN ITS FIRST </p><p>ELECTIONS SINCE 1992.  THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>INFLUENCE IN ALL EGYPTIAN LABOR AND PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES, </p><p>MANY HOLDING SEATS ON UNION BOARDS FROZEN FOR THAT VERY </p><p>REASON BY THE GOVERNMENT IN 1996.  WHILE NO MB POPULARITY </p><p>POLLS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED, ESTIMATES THAT THEY COULD GAIN 20 </p><p>TO 30 PERCENT OF PARLIAMENTARY SEATS IN A FREE AND FAIR </p><p>ELECTION SEEM PLAUSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>STRONG POLITICAL ORGANIZATION AND DISCIPLINE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) IN THE FALL 2000 PA ELECTIONS AND AGAIN IN THE BAR </p><p>SYNDICATE IN FEBRUARY, THE MB DEMONSTRATED BETTER </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND MORE PARTY DISCIPLINE THAN OTHER PARTIES AND </p><p>CANDIDATES.  A FORMER DIRECTOR OF STATE SECURITY TOLD "ROSE </p><p>EL YOUSSEF" MAGAZINE ON APRIL 21, 2001 THAT THE VICTORY OF </p><p>THE MB IN THE PA ELECTIONS "WAS NOT A RESULT OF THEIR </p><p>STRENGTH IN PROPAGATING THEIR IDEOLOGY, BUT (WAS) A RESULT OF </p><p>THE PASSIVENESS AND LACK OF ORGANIZATION OF OTHER FORCES ON </p><p>THE POLITICAL SCENE."  NDP AND OPPOSITION PARTY OFFICIALS </p><p>HAVE COME TO THE SAME REALIZATION.  ISLAMIC AND SECULAR </p><p>INTELLECTUALS DOUBT THAT WERE THE MB TO GAIN A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>NUMBER OF SEATS IN THE PARLIAMENT THAT THEY WOULD BE </p><p>REELECTED TO SECOND TERMS, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO MEANINGFUL </p><p>MESSAGE.  THE GOVERNMENT PREVENTED THEM FROM RUNNING IN THE </p><p>SHURA COUNCIL (UPPER HOUSE) ELECTIONS HELD MAY 16-JUNE 12 BY </p><p>ARRESTING CANDIDATES AND SUPPORTERS IN PRE-ELECTION SWEEPS, A </p><p>RE-PLAY OF STEPS TAKEN BEFORE THE PA ELECTIONS.  OF A </p><p>POSSIBLE 20 INDEPENDENT MB CANDIDATES, ONLY ONE REMAINED BY </p><p>ELECTION TIME TO RUN FOR A SHURA COUNCIL SEAT.  HE DID NOT </p><p>WIN.  THE SUCCESS OF THE MB WHEN IT IS PERMITTED TO RUN IS </p><p>DUE IN PART TO THE INABILITY OF THE RULING AND OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES TO ORGANIZE OR IMPROVE PARTY DISCIPLINE AND TO PUT </p><p>FORWARD POPULAR CANDIDATES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>OUTREACH KEY TO POPULARITY </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) MUSLIM BROTHERS\' OUTREACH IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE </p><p>POOR BUT THEIR SERVICES ARE NOT LIMITED ONLY TO THE POOR. </p><p>THEY ARE ACTIVELY DELIVERING EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE AND LEGAL </p><p>SERVICES TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT.  THEY ARE INVOLVED IN </p><p>ALL THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (SYNDICATES) AND ARE THE </p><p>BACKBONE OF THE EGYPTIAN MEDICAL AND TEACHERS\' SYNDICATES. </p><p>WITHIN THE SYNDICATES THEY HAVE REACHED OUT TO A BROAD </p><p>AUDIENCE, BY FOR INSTANCE, OFFERING MEMBERS REDUCED PRICE </p><p>MEDICAL COVERAGE.  IN THE JOURNALISTS\' SYNDICATE, THE MB </p><p>HELPED MEMBERS TO GET INCREASED BENEFITS INCLUDING SUBSIDIZED </p><p>HOUSING AND CREDIT CARDS (WITH A US$1,500 LIMIT), A BENEFIT </p><p>VIEWED VERY POSITIVELY EVEN BY ANTI-MB JOURNALISTS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) DOCTORS AND NURSES PROVIDE INEXPENSIVE, SOMETIMES </p><p>FREE MEDICAL CARE TO THE POOR FOR WHOM THERE ARE NO OR </p><p>INSUFFICIENT GOVERNMENT SERVICES.  WHILE THE MB SOMETIMES </p><p>OPERATE  MEDICAL CLINICS AT MOSQUES, THE LACK OF INFORMATION </p><p>ABOUT WHO IS ACTUALLY AN MB MEMBER HAS SOMETIMES RESULTED IN </p><p>BENEFICIARIES THINKING THE MB HAS HELPED THEM WHEN IT HAS </p><p>NOT.  THE MB-DOMINATED DOCTORS\' SYNDICATE HAS MADE IT </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR MEMBERS OF ALL SYNDICATES TO OBTAIN REASONABLY </p><p>PRICED HEALTH INSURANCE.  THE MB REPORTEDLY PROVIDES </p><p>STIPENDS, COVERING LIVING AND BOOK EXPENSES, TO POOR MB </p><p>STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITIES.  MB SHOP OWNERS PROVIDE SUBSIDIZED, </p><p>SOMETIMES FREE, FOOD AND CLOTHING TO THE NEEDY IN </p><p>IMPOVERISHED AREAS.  THE MB IS FILLING A GAP IN A SOCIETY </p><p>WITH FEW GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND POOR ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE </p><p>THAT EXIST. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) MANY KNOWN MUSLIM BROTHER LEADERS ARE FROM EDUCATED, </p><p>SOMETIMES WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUNDS.  THE LEADERS ARE </p><p>INVOLVED IN MOST ASPECTS OF PROFESSIONAL AND COMMERCIAL LIFE </p><p>IN EGYPT: MEDICINE, LAW, ENGINEERING, EDUCATION, AND </p><p>BUSINESS, FROM SMALL STORES AND BASIC SERVICES TO HEADING </p><p>LARGE COMPANIES.  A LARGE AMOUNT OF THEIR FINANCING IS </p><p>THOUGHT TO COME FROM ABROAD, PRINCIPALLY FROM SAUDI SOURCES, </p><p>INTERESTED IN PROMOTING A MORE CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS TREND </p><p>IN EGYPT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>CONTROVERSY ABOUNDS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE MB\'S POPULAR IMAGE IS NOT WITHOUT CONTROVERSY. </p><p>WHEN THE BAR SYNDICATE WAS JUDICIALLY SEQUESTERED IN 1996, IT </p><p>WAS ON THE BASIS OF A COMPLAINT BY NON-MB LAWYERS THAT MB </p><p>SYNDICAL LEADERS WERE DISPENSING THE SYNDICATE\'S CONTRACTS </p><p>AND LOANS TO MB SUPPORTERS, CHANNELING EMPLOYMENT </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES AND PROFITS TO MB COMPANIES.  (IN THIS WAY, </p><p>THEIR OPERATIONS MIRRORED THAT OF THE RULING PARTY.) </p><p>NONETHELESS, THEY ARE BROADLY PERCEIVED AS MORE HONEST THAN </p><p>THE RULING NDP. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) ONE PROFESSOR ASKED RHETORICALLY, "THINGS ARE SO </p><p>BAD, COULD THEY (THE MB) REALLY BE ANY WORSE?"  A WELL-KNOWN </p><p>ISLAMIST LAWYER HOWEVER, TAKES ISSUE WITH THAT CONTENTION, </p><p>"THEIR POPULARITY RESTS ON A SLOGAN... THEY HAVE NO ANSWERS, </p><p>NO SOLUTIONS TO EGYPT\'S VERY REAL PROBLEMS (PARTICULARLY) THE </p><p>ECONOMIC CRISIS - THE MOST SERIOUS OF EGYPT\'S PROBLEMS," HE </p><p>STRESSED.  ANALYSIS OF MB ACTIVITIES IN THE PA, HE AND OTHERS </p><p>SAY, SUPPORTS THE CLAIM THAT THE MB HAS NO SOLUTIONS.  "THE </p><p>MB IS ABSORBED WITH PAROCHIAL, RELIGIOUS ISSUES RATHER THAN </p><p>ISSUES OF NATIONAL CONSEQUENCE," A POLITICAL SCIENCE </p><p>PROFESSOR ASSESSED.  AN NDP PA MEMBER COMMENTED THAT MB </p><p>MEMBERS ARE COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES, </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY  WASTING A GREAT DEAL OF THE ASSEMBLY\'S TIME. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>REGIONAL ISSUES WORK IN THEIR FAVOR </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) REGIONAL POLITICS HAVE BOLSTERED THE MB\'S IMAGE. </p><p>RISING DISCONTENT OVER ISRAEL\'S TREATMENT OF THE PALESTINIANS </p><p>AND WHAT IS PERCEIVED AS A HALF-HEARTED RESPONSE BY ARAB </p><p>LEADERS HAVE STRENGTHENED THE MB, WHO HAVE MADE A NAME FOR </p><p>THEMSELVES AS STAUNCH SUPPORTERS OF THE PALESTINIANS.  THEY </p><p>ARE THE MAIN INSTIGATORS OF PRO-PALESTINIAN AND </p><p>ANTI-ISRAEL/U.S. DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE CAMPUSES AND AT THE </p><p>SYNDICATES AND ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF POPULAR ANGER OVER </p><p>THE AL AQSA INTIFADA.  MANY OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS, INCLUDING </p><p>AN EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENTIST, REMIND US THAT THE </p><p>MB RIDE THE TIDE OF POPULAR CONCERNS: ANTI-CORRUPTION, </p><p>PRO-PALESTINE, ANTI-ISRAEL AND THE PEACE PROCESS.  THEY ARE </p><p>USING THESE HOT ISSUES, HE ESTIMATES, TO "PENETRATE" STUDENT </p><p>UNIONS AND PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES.  THE PROFESSOR, LIKE MANY </p><p>EGYPTIANS, BELIEVES THE MB HAS NO STRATEGY PER SE OTHER THAN </p><p>GAINING POWER.  HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN </p><p>INCREASING THEIR OUTREACH BEYOND A COMMITTED NUCLEUS, BUT HE </p><p>BELIEVES THAT IS STILL MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE OUTREACH BY </p><p>MOST POLITICAL PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>"OBJECTIVE OPPOSITION" TURNS SOUR </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) DESPITE MASSIVE ARRESTS, TRIAL AND IMPRISONMENT OF </p><p>RESPECTED MB LEADERS IN RECENT YEARS, THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>CONTINUES.  THE ELECTORAL VICTORY OF 17 MUSLIM BROTHERS IN </p><p>THE FALL ELECTIONS REPRESENTS A CHALLENGE TO THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>MB\'S ARE AN ILLEGAL BUT DE FACTO BLOC IN THE PARLIAMENT. </p><p>INITIALLY, MB PARLIAMENTARIANS SEEMED TO PLAY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S GAME.  OBSERVERS SPECULATED THAT A TRUCE OF </p><p>SORTS HAD BEEN DECLARED BETWEEN THE MB AND STATE SECURITY. </p><p>UNDER WHAT MB MP HAMDI HASSAN TERMED A POLICY OF "OBJECTIVE </p><p>OPPOSITION" (TO GOVERNMENT POLICIES), HE TOLD AL AHRAM </p><p>NEWSPAPER, "THE BROTHERHOOD\'S DEPUTIES CALLED INTO QUESTION </p><p>THE STATE\'S PUBLISHING THREE "PORNOGRAPHIC" BOOKS, WHICH WERE </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY WITHDRAWN TO AVOID A POTENTIALLY DAMAGING </p><p>DEBATE."  HE ADDED THAT THE MB DID NOT OBJECT TO THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S JANUARY 22 GOVERNMENT POLICY STATEMENT.  "WE </p><p>WANTED TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE (MB) PRESENCE... </p><p>SHOULD NOT TRIGGER EXCESSIVE FEARS.  (OUR) PRESENCE DOES </p><p>REALLY GO IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRACY AND NOT AGAINST IT..." </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) HOWEVER, ON APRIL 21, THE 17 MB MP\'S STORMED OUT OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT, PROTESTING THE SPEAKER\'S REFUSAL TO GIVE THEM THE </p><p>FLOOR TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF ARREST OF 2 MB SHURA COUNCIL </p><p>CANDIDATES.  FOLLOWING THIS CONFRONTATION, THE MB BLOC </p><p>SUBMITTED TO THE SPEAKER A LONG LIST OF QUESTIONS </p><p>"EMBARRASSING" TO THE GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO ONE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.  THEY CALL UPON THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>CANCEL THE "MISS EGYPT" PAGEANT; QUESTION THE MORALITY OF AN </p><p>ARTICLE IN THE STATE-OWNED FILM MAGAZINE, "THE STARS"; ACCUSE </p><p>THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR OF IGNORING VIOLENCE IN THE SCHOOLS; </p><p>AND REQUEST PARLIAMENTARY SESSIONS PAUSE REGULARLY FOR </p><p>PRAYERS.  TARGETED MINISTERS INCLUDE THE POWERFUL MINISTERS </p><p>OF AGRICULTURE YOUSSEF WALY, OF INFORMATION SAFWAT SHERIF AND </p><p>CULTURE MINISTER FAROUQ HOSNI.  THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO GARNER </p><p>PUBLIC SUPPORT WITH TIRADES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>CORRUPTION, AND AGAINST EDUCATION MINISTER BAHA EDDIN FOR </p><p>REASSIGNING THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS TO ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS </p><p>BECAUSE THEY WERE MB SUPPORTERS AT A TIME WHEN THE RATE OF </p><p>ILLITERACY AND LACK OF EDUCATION ARE PROFOUND SOCIAL </p><p>CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>FUTURE PROSPECTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) TO CONTINUE TO GROW BEYOND ITS CURRENT SUPPORTERS, </p><p>THE MB DEPENDS ON UNREST IN THE REGION, POPULAR DISCONTENT </p><p>OVER GOVERNMENT MISMANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY, CORRUPTION AND </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT.  THE AVERAGE EGYPTIAN BELIEVES THAT THINGS </p><p>CAN\'T REALLY GET MUCH WORSE WERE THE MB MORE INFLUENTIAL. </p><p>THEY MIGHT EVEN GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO THE PEOPLE.  THE </p><p>MIDDLE CLASS JUST "WANTS TO GET BY" WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OR RELIGIOUS TYPES.  INTELLECTUALS TEND TO BE </p><p>STRIDENTLY ANTI-MB.  AS AN NDP POLITICIAN AND JOURNALIST </p><p>COMMENTED, "IF ONLY 6 PERCENT OF EGYPTIANS ARE POLITICIZED, A </p><p>LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE PRO-MB."  HOWEVER, HE AND OUR </p><p>OTHER INTERLOCUTORS BELIEVE THAT THE MB ARE NOT SO POPULAR </p><p>NOR IS THEIR BASE OF SUPPORT SO SIGNIFICANT THAT THEY COULD </p><p>TAKE OVER THE REINS OF POWER TODAY, OR IN THE VERY NEAR </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) WHILE THE MB HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESUME A </p><p>PLACE ON THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, THEIR POWER AND INFLUENCE </p><p>REMAIN LIMITED.  STATE SECURITY FORCES MAINTAIN THE MB IN A </p><p>TIGHT VISE SINCE THE BAR SYNDICATE ELECTIONS AND HAVE MADE IT </p><p>CLEAR THAT THEY WILL WIN NO MORE POWER OFFICIALLY FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MB REPRESENTS A </p><p>SERIOUS THREAT TO THE GOE.  IT IS NOT CAPABLE OF SEIZING </p><p>POWER AND MANY OF ITS YOUNGER MEMBERS SEEM TO FAVOR POLITICAL </p><p>ADVANCEMENT THROUGH ELECTIONS.  IN THE CONTINUED ABSENCE OF </p><p>SECULAR OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES THE MB WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>REPRESENT FOR MANY THE ONLY VIABLE POLITICAL OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HARNISH </p><p></p></div>
