(U) Classified by Charge D\'Affaires Thomas Williams for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (C). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) This is an action request; please see paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On the heels of the very successful May 2002 Hawala Conference </p><p>in Abu Dhabi </p><p>(reftel), UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan Al-Suweidi officially </p><p>notified the </p><p>Ambassador on February 5 of his intention to host the Second </p><p>International Conference </p><p>on Hawala in Abu Dhabi, April 2-3, 2003.  The preliminary agenda </p><p>includes panel </p><p>discussions by representatives from FATF, law enforcements agencies, </p><p>and academia, </p><p>and presentations from banking representatives from Central Asia, the </p><p>Middle East, </p><p>and Africa among others. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  Additional information regarding the conference </p><p>agenda and a </p><p>registration form will become available on the UAE Central Bank\'s </p><p>website </p><p>(WWW.CBUAE.GOV.AE) in the next few days.  The draft agenda does not </p><p>mention charities </p><p>and charitable organizations, despite the Governor\'s earlier </p><p>indications that the </p><p>topic would be discussed during or on the margins of the Second Hawala </p><p>Conference. </p><p>We will raise this with the Governor in subsequent meetings and report </p><p>any response </p><p>we receive.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Action request: Post requests that USG participants -- once an </p><p>official </p><p>delegation is constituted via the interagency process -- allow the </p><p>Embassy to </p><p>coordinate travel and accommodations and that they not/not register </p><p>directly for the </p><p>conference via the UAE Central Bank website.  This will ensure that the </p><p>U.S. </p><p>delegation can be located together, simplifying considerably the </p><p>logistical </p><p>arrangements. </p><p> </p><p>Williams </p><p></p></div>
