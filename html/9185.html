<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 09 ABU DHABI 003164 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IFD/OIA </p><p>STATE PASS TO USTR AND OPIC </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/GUGLIELMI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ECON, KSPR, KTBD, KPRP, OPIC, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE: 2003 INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 128494 </p><p> </p><p>UAE:  INVESTMENT CLIMATE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.a.1.  Openness To Foreign Investment </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>Investment laws and regulations are evolving in the UAE and are </p><p>expected to become more conducive to foreign investment.  At </p><p>present, the regulatory and legal framework favors local over </p><p>foreign investors.  There is no national treatment for investors </p><p>in the UAE, and foreign ownership of land and stocks is </p><p>restricted.  The Emirate of Dubai announced in 2002, however, </p><p>that it would permit so-called "free hold" real estate ownership </p><p>by non-GCC nationals within certain properties, though the exact </p><p>legal status is still uncertain.  Because investment regulations </p><p>vary from emirate to emirate, it is recommended that potential </p><p>investors consult a local attorney to obtain the most current </p><p>investment information at an early stage of planning. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG is opening up its trade sectors in line with the UAE\'s </p><p>WTO obligations, and is drafting a landmark law on foreign direct </p><p>investment that should be approved later this year.  The law </p><p>reportedly will include new tax exemptions and other incentives. </p><p>The UAEG already has taken steps to cut red tape for foreign </p><p>investors, and now exempts investors from obtaining a Ministry of </p><p>Labor card in addition to an Immigration Department visa. </p><p>Investors no longer need to appear in person to inquire about the </p><p>status of business applications in Abu Dhabi.  A new automated </p><p>service, offered in Arabic and English, allows investors to </p><p>receive information about their business licenses over the phone. </p><p> </p><p>There have been no significant investment disputes during the </p><p>past few years involving U.S. or other foreign investors.  Claims </p><p>resolution has not generally been a problem, although foreign </p><p>companies tend not to press claims. </p><p> </p><p>Regulation of the establishment and conduct of business in the </p><p>UAE is shared at the federal and emirate levels.  In general, </p><p>foreign companies (except companies from GCC countries) that </p><p>undertake business activities in the UAE or make their products </p><p>available in the UAE have entered into a joint venture with UAE </p><p>nationals for the establishment of limited liability companies, </p><p>appointed commercial agents, or set up branch offices.  Except </p><p>for companies located in the free zones, at least 51 percent of a </p><p>business establishment must be owned by a UAE national.  A </p><p>business engaged in importing and distributing a product must be </p><p>either a 100 percent UAE owned agency/distributorship or a 51/49 </p><p>percent (UAE/foreign) limited liability company.  Subsidies for </p><p>manufacturing firms are available only to those companies with at </p><p>least 51 percent local ownership. </p><p> </p><p>OIL WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MAJOR SECTOR FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN </p><p>2003.  UAE OIL PRODUCTION CAPACITY CURRENTLY IS AROUND 2.5 </p><p>MILLION BARRELS PER DAY (MB/D).  IT SHOULD RISE TO 2.8 AND 3.0 </p><p>MB/D BY 2005 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.  ABU DHABI COMPANY FOR </p><p>ONSHORE OPERATIONS (ADCO) PLANS TO LIFT PRODUCTION TO 1.45 MB/D, </p><p>ABU DHABI MARINE OPERATING COMPANY (ADMA-OPCO) TO 600,000 B/D AND </p><p>ZAKUM DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (ZADCO) TO 600,000 B/D DURING THE NEXT </p><p>THREE TO FIVE YEARS.  AS PART OF THE EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>IMPROVE OUTPUT AND SEEK FOREIGN TECHNOLOGICAL AND MANAGERIAL </p><p>EXPERTISE, THE STATE-RUN ABU DHABI NATIONAL OIL COMPANY (ADNOC) </p><p>TENDERED THE PRIVATIZATION OF A 28 PERCENT STAKE IN THE OFFSHORE </p><p>ZAKUM OILFIELD IN APRIL 2002.  EXXONMOBIL, CHEVRONTEXACO, SHELL, </p><p>BP AND TOTALFINAELF ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS CONTEST, WITH AN </p><p>OUTCOME EXPECTED IN 2003.  IN 2002, THE UNITED STATES ENJOYED A </p><p>45 PERCENT MARKET SHARE IN OIL AND GAS FIELD EQUIPMENT, SPARE </p><p>PARTS, AND SERVICES.  NO REGULATORY/DEMAND ISSUES AFFECT THE </p><p>MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>We are optimistic that opportunities for foreign investment in </p><p>the public utilities sector will increase as well.  In March 1998 </p><p>the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA) awarded a </p><p>contract for the UAE\'s first independent water and power project </p><p>(IWPP), with an estimated value of USD $750 million, to an </p><p>American firm.  The firm was selected as part of an Anglo- </p><p>American consortium to manage the emirate\'s second IWPP in 2001. </p><p>The Abu Dhabi government has announced that power generation </p><p>(includes power and desalinated water production) and </p><p>transmission will be privatized, while power distribution will </p><p>remain under the control of Abu Dhabi authorities.  The estimated </p><p>commercial value of planned power and water sector development </p><p>projects in Abu Dhabi is USD $10 billion. </p><p> </p><p>Defense contractors with an eye for investment in the UAE must </p><p>negotiate directly with the UAE Offsets Group (UOG), and invest </p><p>an amount that will generate a profit equal to an agreed upon </p><p>portion of their contract in the UAE.  UOG investment projects </p><p>generally must show the required profit after seven years.  The </p><p>contractor may not own more than 49 percent of the project, and </p><p>UAE nationals must hold the remaining 51 percent.  There are </p><p>currently more than 25 offset ventures; offset projects cover the </p><p>full spectrum of economic activity, including, inter alia, </p><p>advertising, fish farming, air conditioning, language centers, </p><p>shipbuilding, aircraft maintenance, leasing, medical services, </p><p>and even polo grounds.  Two of the largest offset ventures are an </p><p>international gas pipeline project (Dolphin) and the Oasis </p><p>International leasing company -- a British Aerospace offsets </p><p>venture. </p><p> </p><p>There is no income tax in the UAE.  Foreign banks pay 20 percent </p><p>tax on their profits.  Foreign oil companies with equity in </p><p>concessions pay taxes and royalties on their proceeds.  There are </p><p>no consumption taxes, and the GCC states formally implemented a </p><p>single import tariff of 5 percent on most goods January 1, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.2.  Conversion And Transfer Policies </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>There are no restrictions or delays on the import or export of </p><p>either the UAE Dirham or foreign currencies by foreigners or UAE </p><p>nationals, with the exception of Israeli currency and the </p><p>currencies of those countries subject to United Nations </p><p>sanctions.  The UAEG passed comprehensive anti-money laundering </p><p>legislation following the attacks of September 11, 2001, that </p><p>imposes strict documentary requirements on large wire transfers. </p><p>Travelers entering or leaving the UAE must now declare currency </p><p>amounts of more than 50,000 dirhams (approximately USD $13,700) </p><p>as part of these new measures. </p><p> </p><p>Since November 1980, the Dirham, though formally pegged to the </p><p>IMF\'s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) at the rate of 4.76190 </p><p>Dirhams/SDR (with a margin of fluctuation set initially at 2.25 </p><p>percent and widened in August 1987 to 7.25 percent) has remained </p><p>fixed against the U.S. Dollar.  The exchange rate is 3.67 UAE </p><p>Dirhams per one U.S. Dollar. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.3.  Expropriation And Compensation </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>Foreign investors have not been involved in any expropriations in </p><p>the UAE in recent years.  There are no set rules governing </p><p>compensation if expropriations were to occur, and individual </p><p>emirates probably would treat this differently.  In practice, </p><p>authorities in the UAE would not expropriate unless there was a </p><p>compelling developmental or public interest need to do so, and in </p><p>such cases compensation would be generous. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.4.  Dispute Settlement </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>There have been no significant investment disputes during the </p><p>past few years involving U.S. or other foreign investors, but </p><p>there have been several contractor disputes, with the government </p><p>as well as local businesses.  Disputes generally are resolved by </p><p>arbitration, by the parties themselves, or by recourse to the </p><p>legal system.  Dispute resolution can be difficult and uncertain, </p><p>however.  Arbitration may commence by petition to the federal </p><p>courts on the basis of mutual consent, a written arbitration </p><p>agreement, independently or by nomination of arbitrators, or </p><p>through a referral to an appointing authority without recourse to </p><p>judicial proceedings.  Enforcing arbitration judgments can be </p><p>difficult as they require court certification, and judicial </p><p>proceedings may continue for several years. </p><p> </p><p>The UAE constitution established a federal court system while </p><p>acknowledging the right of the individual emirates to maintain a </p><p>court system of their own.  Accordingly, each emirate applies </p><p>federal law in its own court system that consists of courts of </p><p>first instance, courts of appeal and a Supreme Court.  The court </p><p>of first instance consists of civil, criminal, and sharia </p><p>(Islamic law) courts.  Sharia law is only applicable to Muslims </p><p>and relates to family matters mentioned in the Koran.  Courts </p><p>will interpret statutory law and legal precedent in deciding </p><p>cases.  Commercial disputes involving foreign parties tend to </p><p>come before the civil courts in the federal system; a panel of </p><p>three judges ordinarily hears commercial disputes.  All cases </p><p>involving banks and financial institutions are required to be </p><p>heard by civil courts.  In Abu Dhabi, all non-arbitration </p><p>commercial disputes are first brought to the Abu Dhabi </p><p>Conciliation Department.  If the parties are unable to reach a </p><p>settlement, they can begin legal proceedings in the court of </p><p>first instance. </p><p> </p><p>The UAE federal Supreme Court has held that a foreign arbitration </p><p>clause in a registered commercial agency agreement is </p><p>unenforceable because the Commercial Agency Law of 1981 states </p><p>that UAE courts have jurisdiction over commercial agency </p><p>disputes.  According to an analysis by Western-trained attorneys </p><p>of the UAE code of civil procedure, however, UAE courts will </p><p>recognize a decision by both parties to refer a dispute to </p><p>arbitration.  No party in a dispute can file a court claim if </p><p>such party already has agreed to refer the claim to arbitration. </p><p>The parties can move to arbitration at any stage during </p><p>litigation.  The civil procedure code details rules governing the </p><p>qualification of arbitrators and many other aspects of the </p><p>arbitration process.  The venue of arbitration is required to be </p><p>within the UAE, and if not, the resultant award is treated like a </p><p>foreign judgment. </p><p> </p><p>The code contains comprehensive rules in connection with the </p><p>various types of preventive and provisional remedies prior to </p><p>litigation and the issuance of judgments, including the </p><p>attachment of property, confiscation of the defendant\'s passport </p><p>and prohibitions on travel, as well as the detention of the </p><p>defendant in certain instances.  However, the courts must certify </p><p>all arbitration decisions, and though they do not review </p><p>substantive claims, they can invalidate decisions based on </p><p>procedural considerations.  Parties can also appeal certification </p><p>decisions thus prolonging enforcement indefinitely. </p><p> </p><p>In 1993 the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry formed the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Commercial Conciliation and Arbitration Center in an </p><p>effort to accelerate commercial dispute resolution.  The Center </p><p>has jurisdiction to conciliate or arbitrate commercial disputes. </p><p>Currently, the Center has 135 open cases and accepts roughly 30- </p><p>40 new cases each year.  The Center\'s executive regulations </p><p>govern the conciliation and arbitration procedure.  Though </p><p>referral by the parties to the Dispute Center ostensibly requires </p><p>them to accept the finality of the Center\'s decision, the courts </p><p>must still certify the decision and enforcement can be delayed. </p><p>The Center conducts proceedings in Arabic or any other agreed </p><p>upon language. </p><p> </p><p>The Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry has promulgated </p><p>similar commercial conciliation and arbitration rules that permit </p><p>parties to have conciliation or arbitration proceedings under the </p><p>auspices of the Chamber. </p><p> </p><p>The UAE is a member of the International Center for the </p><p>Settlement of Investment Disputes.  In May 2003, the UAE Cabinet </p><p>approved entry into the New York Convention of 1958 on the </p><p>Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.  The UAEG </p><p>is likely to implement the legislation enacting the Convention by </p><p>the end of the year. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.5.  Performance Requirements/Incentives </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>As listed elsewhere in this report, the regulatory and legal </p><p>framework in the UAE favors local over foreign investors.  There </p><p>is no national treatment for investors in the UAE.  The UAE </p><p>maintains non-tariff barriers to investment in the form of </p><p>restrictive agency, sponsorship, and distributorship </p><p>requirements.  In order to do business in the UAE outside one of </p><p>the free zones, a foreign business in most cases must have a UAE </p><p>national sponsor, agent or distributor.  Once chosen, sponsors, </p><p>agents, or distributors have exclusive rights.  They cannot be </p><p>replaced without their agreement.  Government tendering is not </p><p>conducted according to generally accepted international </p><p>standards, and re-tendering is the norm.  To bid on federal </p><p>projects, a supplier or contractor must be either a UAE national </p><p>or a company in which UAE nationals own at least 51 percent of </p><p>the capital.  Federal tenders must be accompanied by a bid bond </p><p>in the form of an unconditional bank guarantee for 5 percent of </p><p>the value of the bid. </p><p> </p><p>Incentives are given to foreign investors in the free zones. </p><p>Outside the free zones, no incentives are given, although the </p><p>ability to purchase property as freehold in certain favored </p><p>projects in Dubai -- and promises that foreign owners of such </p><p>property would be granted residence permits as long as they </p><p>remained in possession of title -- would appear to be incentives </p><p>aimed at attracting foreign investment. </p><p> </p><p>Visas, residence permits, and work permits are required of all </p><p>foreigners in the UAE except nationals from GCC countries. </p><p>Americans are eligible to receive 10-year, multiple entry visas, </p><p>which authorize stay up to six months per entry, with the </p><p>possibility of a six-month extension.  U.S. citizens may obtain </p><p>visas for business and tourism at the airport upon arrival. </p><p>These visas do not permit employment in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.6.  Right To Private Ownership And Establishment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>Except as detailed elsewhere in this report, there are no </p><p>restrictions on the right of private entities to establish and </p><p>own business enterprises and engage in all forms of remunerative </p><p>activity. </p><p>13.a.7.  Protection Of Property Rights </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>The concept of a mortgage has just been introduced -- but only </p><p>for select Dubai-based five-star property developments. </p><p>Mortgages are generally unavailable beyond these limited </p><p>exceptions.  Title to all land in Abu Dhabi, the largest emirate, </p><p>resides in the ruler.  Most construction, commercial and </p><p>residential, is financed by a specialized agency of the </p><p>government of Abu Dhabi, and commercial banks finance the </p><p>remainder.  Their collateral traditionally has been access to the </p><p>rent stream of the building or the personal guarantee of the </p><p>developer. </p><p> </p><p>AS PART AND PARCEL OF ITS DEVELOPMENT INTO A REGIONAL TRADING </p><p>CENTER, THE UAEG HAS MADE THE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY </p><p>A PRIORITY IN RECENT YEARS.  NEW COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK AND PATENT </p><p>LAWS, PASSED IN 2002, PROVIDE HIGH LEVELS OF PROTECTION FOR U.S. </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHILE AN AGREEMENT -- BROKERED BY THE </p><p>EMBASSY IN 2002 -- CONTINUES TO PROVIDE TRIPS-PLUS LEVELS OF </p><p>PROTECTION FOR U.S. PHARMACEUTICALS. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG repealed previous copyright, trademark, and patent laws </p><p>and issued improved legislation in 2002 in harmony with </p><p>international standards and exceeding the UAE\'s TRIPs </p><p>obligations.  The new copyright law, enacted in July 2002, is the </p><p>product of a prolonged dialog between the UAEG and international </p><p>organizations such as WIPO and the WTO.  It grants protections to </p><p>authors of creative works and expands the categories of protected </p><p>works, to include computer programs, software, databases, and </p><p>other digital works.  Efforts to combat computer software piracy </p><p>in the UAE have been successful.  According to 2001 industry </p><p>estimates, the rate of software piracy in the UAE is the lowest </p><p>in the Middle East.  The UAE is recognized as the regional leader </p><p>in fighting computer software piracy. </p><p> </p><p>THE UAE\'S NEW TRADEMARK LAW, ALSO ISSUED IN JULY 2002, CONFIRMS </p><p>THAT THE UAE WILL FOLLOW THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM </p><p>AND THAT ONE TRADEMARK CAN BE REGISTERED IN A NUMBER OF CLASSES. </p><p>THE NEW LAW PROVIDES THAT THE OWNER OF THE REGISTRATION SHALL </p><p>ENJOY EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO THE USE OF THE TRADEMARK AS REGISTERED </p><p>AND CAN PREVENT OTHERS FROM USING AN IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR MARK ON </p><p>SIMILAR, IDENTICAL OR RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IF IT CAUSES </p><p>CONFUSION AMONG CONSUMERS. </p><p> </p><p>THE UAEG PUBLISHED THE OFFICIAL AND FINAL VERSION IN NOVEMBER </p><p>2002 OF THE LONG-AWAITED PATENT LAW.  SPECIFICALLY, THE PATENT </p><p>LAW PROVIDES FOR -- IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UAE\'S TRIPS </p><p>OBLIGATIONS -- NATIONAL TREATMENT FOR IP OWNERS IN OTHER WTO </p><p>MEMBER STATES, BOTH PRODUCT AND PROCESS PATENT PROTECTION, AND </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OF IPR WHEREBY CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURES AND </p><p>REMEDIES MAY BE EMPLOYED. </p><p> </p><p>In March 2002, the UAE Ministries of Health and Finance and </p><p>Industry conveyed in writing their acceptance of PhRMA\'s best and </p><p>final offer under which 25 U.S. patent-protected, innovative </p><p>products would be afforded 5-year data exclusivity protection. </p><p>Under the terms of the agreement which PhRMA and the UAEG </p><p>accepted, all other U.S.-patented drugs, whether pending </p><p>registration or not, will be given data exclusivity protection in </p><p>the UAE market equal to the patent term -- a commitment which is </p><p>consistent with the UAE\'s TRIPs obligations. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.8.  Transparency Of The Regulatory System </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>The fundamental instrument by which all of the emirates regulate </p><p>business activity is the requirement that any place of business </p><p>must acquire and maintain a proper license.  The procedures for </p><p>obtaining a license vary from emirate to emirate, but are </p><p>straightforward and publicly available. </p><p> </p><p>A license is not required unless a place of business is set up in </p><p>the UAE.  In other words, foreign businesses exporting to the UAE </p><p>but without a regular or continuing business presence in the UAE </p><p>do not need a license. Licenses available include trade licenses, </p><p>industrial licenses, service licenses, professional licenses, and </p><p>construction licenses. </p><p> </p><p>Several federal regulations govern business activities in the UAE </p><p>outside free trade zones.  Activities within the free zones are </p><p>governed by special bylaws. </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Companies Law applies to all commercial companies </p><p>established in the UAE and to branch offices of foreign companies </p><p>operating in the UAE. The following provisions are of particular </p><p>importance to foreign investors: </p><p>A.  Companies established in the UAE are required to have a </p><p>minimum of 51 percent UAE national ownership.  However, profits </p><p>may be apportioned differently. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Branch offices of foreign companies are required to have a </p><p>national agent unless the foreign company has established its </p><p>office pursuant to an agreement with the federal or an emirate </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>C.  All general partnership interest must be owned by UAE </p><p>nationals. </p><p> </p><p>D.  Foreign shareholders may hold up to a 49 percent interest in </p><p>limited liability companies. </p><p> </p><p>The Commercial Agencies Law requires that foreign principals </p><p>distribute their products in the UAE only through exclusive </p><p>commercial agents that are either UAE nationals or companies </p><p>wholly owned by UAE nationals.  The foreign principal can appoint </p><p>one agent for the entire UAE or for a particular emirate or group </p><p>of emirates.  The law provides that an agent may be terminated </p><p>only by mutual agreement of the foreign principal and the local </p><p>agent, notwithstanding the expiration of the term of the agency </p><p>agreement. </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Industry Law stipulates that industrial projects must </p><p>have 51 percent UAE national ownership.  The law also requires </p><p>that projects either be managed by a UAE national or have a board </p><p>of directors with a majority of UAE nationals.  Exemptions from </p><p>the law are provided for projects relating to extraction and </p><p>refining of oil, natural gas, and other raw materials. </p><p>Additionally, projects with a small capital investment or special </p><p>projects governed by special laws or agreements are exempt from </p><p>the industry law. </p><p> </p><p>The Government Tenders Law stipulates that a supplier, </p><p>contractor, or tenderer with respect to federal projects must </p><p>either be a UAE national or a company in which UAE nationals own </p><p>at least 51 percent of the share capital.  Foreign companies </p><p>wishing to bid for a federal project must, therefore, enter into </p><p>a joint venture or agency arrangement with a UAE national or </p><p>company.  Federal tenders must accompany a bid bond in the form </p><p>of an unconditional bank guarantee for 5 percent of the value of </p><p>the bid. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.9.  Efficient Capital Markets And Portfolio Investment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>The UAE federal commercial code, promulgated in 1993, devotes an </p><p>entire chapter to bankruptcy -- the first comprehensive </p><p>legislation in the UAE on the subject.  Monetary judgments in </p><p>bankruptcy cases are made in the local currency, and UAE courts </p><p>enforce the judgments of foreign courts if there is reciprocity </p><p>based on bilateral or international treaties.  In the judgment of </p><p>Western legal experts, the commercial code chapter on bankruptcy </p><p>governs the procedures and effects of bankruptcy in the UAE, but </p><p>does not provide a mechanism for the orderly evaluation and </p><p>distribution of assets of a bankrupt entity. </p><p> </p><p>Credit is allocated on market terms.  There are 21 UAE-owned </p><p>banks with 344 branches in the UAE and abroad, 26 foreign banks </p><p>with 109 branches, one restricted license bank, two investment </p><p>banks, and 49 representative offices.  The Central Bank no longer </p><p>issues licenses for new foreign banks to establish branches in </p><p>the UAE.  Citibank is the only U.S. bank in the UAE that offers </p><p>full banking services.  Bank of America has a representative </p><p>office in Dubai, while Bank of New York has one in Abu Dhabi. </p><p>The largest banks in terms of assets include the National Bank of </p><p>Abu Dhabi, National Bank of Dubai, Emirates Bank International, </p><p>Mashreqbank, and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. </p><p> </p><p>The Central Bank prohibits lending an amount greater than 7 </p><p>percent of a bank\'s capital base to any single customer.  Foreign </p><p>banks with branches in the UAE are not permitted to calculate </p><p>loans as a percentage of their global capital, which may however </p><p>be used to calculate the capital adequacy ratio.  In a revision </p><p>to the rule, the Central Bank in 1993 said it would exclude from </p><p>the requirement non-funded exposures, such as letters of credit </p><p>and guarantees.  The Central Bank also announced implementation </p><p>of internationally recognized and accepted accounting principles. </p><p>THE UAEG IMPLEMENTED A BODY OF ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION </p><p>AT THE END OF 2001, WHICH INCLUDED STRINGENT REPORTING </p><p>REQUIREMENTS FOR WIRE TRANSFERS EXCEEDING USD $545 AND CURRENCY </p><p>IMPORTATION/EXPORTATION OF AMOUNTS EXCEEDING APPROXIMATELY USD </p><p>$13,700.  THE LAW IMPOSES STIFF CRIMINAL PENALTIES (JAIL TIME AND </p><p>FINES) FOR MONEY LAUNDERING AND ALSO PROVIDES SAFE HARBOR </p><p>PROVISIONS FOR THOSE WHO REPORT SUCH CRIMES.  BANKS AND OTHER </p><p>FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW STRICT "KNOW YOUR </p><p>CUSTOMER" GUIDELINES; ALL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS MORE THAN USD </p><p>$54,000, REGARDLESS OF THEIR NATURE, MUST BE REPORTED TO THE UAE </p><p>CENTRAL BANK.  BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISED </p><p>BY THE CENTRAL BANK (EXCHANGE HOUSES, INVESTMENT COMPANIES, AND </p><p>BROKERAGES) ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN RECORDS ON ALL TRANSACTIONS </p><p>FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>The UAE Central Bank established the Anti-Money Laundering and </p><p>Suspicious Cases Unit (AMLSCU) in 1998 to perform the functions </p><p>of a financial intelligence unit (FIU).  The AMLSCU joined the </p><p>prestigious Egmont Group of FIUs -- the first Arab country to do </p><p>so -- at the Group\'s June 2002 conference in Monaco.  This </p><p>membership was the basis of a number of Memoranda Of </p><p>Understanding the AMLSCU signed with other countries\' FIUs in </p><p>2002 to facilitate information sharing and case processing.  The </p><p>AMLSCU participated in seminars, consultative meetings, and </p><p>training with Washington-based agencies in 2002, including the </p><p>Department of Treasury\'s FinCEN.  Banks, customs officials, and </p><p>other relevant personnel are required to file suspicious </p><p>transaction reports with the unit. </p><p> </p><p>Local banks finance most non-oil investment in the UAE.  Even so, </p><p>banks lack sufficient lending opportunities in the UAE, and </p><p>consequently place most of their funds in overseas markets.  Most </p><p>of the manufacturing sector operates with higher levels of debt </p><p>than prescribed by the 60:40 debt-to-equity ratio -- generally </p><p>the norm for this sector.  Some three-fourths of gross fixed </p><p>capital formation in manufacturing is directly or indirectly </p><p>financed by the banking system. </p><p> </p><p>Abu Dhabi and Dubai each have a stock exchange, but only one </p><p>stock currently is open to foreign investors, and it is capped at </p><p>20 percent total foreign ownership.  Limited participation by </p><p>foreigners in a few mutual funds is permitted. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.10.  Political Violence </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>There have been no instances in recent memory involving </p><p>politically motivated damage to projects, or insurgencies that </p><p>have impacted the investment environment. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.11.  Corruption </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>As in many other countries, corruption is a concern for U.S. </p><p>firms seeking to do business in the UAE.  American firms are </p><p>bound by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act -- a copy of which may </p><p>be obtained from the Commercial Section of the U.S. Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS IS A </p><p>SYSTEMIC PROBLEM; HOWEVER, THE FORMER HEAD OF DUBAI CUSTOMS AND </p><p>PORT AUTHORITY -- ALONG WITH FIVE OTHER CUSTOMS OFFICIALS -- WAS </p><p>TRIED, CONVICTED, AND SENTENCED IN APRIL 2001 TO 27 YEARS IN </p><p>PRISON ON CHARGES OF CORRUPTION AND EMBEZZLEMENT.  HE WAS </p><p>PARDONED FOUR MONTHS LATER BY THE DUBAI GOVERNMENT AND RELEASED. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.11.b. Bilateral Investment Agreements </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>The UAE has bilateral investment agreements with a number of </p><p>countries, including the United Kingdom.  There is no bilateral </p><p>investment treaty with the United States.  While the UAE has </p><p>expressed general interest in discussing a bilateral investment </p><p>treaty with the United States, the lack of national treatment for </p><p>foreign investors has proven problematic, particularly with </p><p>regard to foreign ownership. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.11.c.  OPIC And Other Investment Insurance Programs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>The UAE has been suspended from U.S. OPIC insurance programs </p><p>since 1995 because of the UAEG\'s lack of compliance with </p><p>internationally recognized worker rights standards -- </p><p>particularly laborers\' rights to association and collective </p><p>bargaining.  The ILO reported in April 2003, however, that the </p><p>UAE had started projects to address these concerns, and this year </p><p>drafted a labor law in consultation with the ILO that permits the </p><p>creation of formal labor associations/unions. </p><p> </p><p>Workers currently address grievances and negotiate disputes or </p><p>matters of interest with employers through formal and informal </p><p>mechanisms, including strikes -- even though the law does not </p><p>technically sanction them.  The UAEG does allow workers to </p><p>associate freely for the advancement of common goals and </p><p>interests. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG prohibits strikes by those employed in the public sector </p><p>on the grounds of national security considerations.  There is </p><p>continuous coverage in the local press, however, of private </p><p>sector employees striking in protest of non-payment of wages. </p><p>Throughout 2002 and 2003, Ministry of Labor officials </p><p>investigated and mediated such disputes -- often to the benefit </p><p>of the striking workers -- and negotiated quick settlements. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.11.d.  Labor </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>Population in the UAE is approaching 3.9 million, according to </p><p>2002 data estimates.  More than 80 percent of residents are </p><p>foreigners, and approximately 98 percent of private sector </p><p>workers in the UAE are non-UAE nationals.  Emiratization of the </p><p>UAE workforce remains a national objective, although mandated </p><p>hiring of nationals has been limited to only a few sectors, such </p><p>as banking. </p><p> </p><p>The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively </p><p> </p><p>The law does not specifically grant -- but does not prohibit -- </p><p>workers the right to engage in collective bargaining.  It does, </p><p>however, expressly authorize collective work dispute resolution. </p><p>There were a number of organized gatherings of workers that </p><p>complained of unpaid wages before the Ministry of Labor and </p><p>Social Affairs in 2002.  Professional associations may raise work- </p><p>related concerns, to lobby the UAEG for redress, or to file a </p><p>grievance with the Government.  For the resolution of work- </p><p>related disputes, workers rely on conciliation committees </p><p>organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs or on </p><p>special labor courts. </p><p> </p><p>Labor laws do not cover, and therefore do not protect, government </p><p>employees, domestic servants, and agricultural workers.  The </p><p>latter two groups face considerable difficulty in negotiating </p><p>employment contracts because the mandatory requirements contained </p><p>in the labor law do not apply.  They also face considerable </p><p>difficulty in obtaining assistance to resolve disputes with their </p><p>employers.  UAE employers generally tie an employee\'s residency </p><p>or visa to his employment and sponsorship.  If the employee </p><p>terminates his employment and is unable to secure new employment </p><p>and a new sponsor, the employee loses residency and could be </p><p>required to leave the country. </p><p> </p><p>Businesses in free trade zones must comply with federal labor </p><p>laws; however, the Ministry of Labor does not regulate them. </p><p>Instead, each free trade zone maintains its own labor department </p><p>to address workers\' concerns. </p><p> </p><p>Prohibition of Forced or Bonded Labor </p><p> </p><p>Forced or bonded labor is illegal in the UAE.  However, some </p><p>employment agents bring foreign workers to the country under </p><p>conditions approaching indenture.  Some women reportedly are </p><p>brought to the country for service sector employment and later </p><p>forced into prostitution.  The Government prohibits forced and </p><p>bonded child labor and generally enforces this prohibition </p><p>effectively.  In particular, the UAEG has taken concrete steps to </p><p>resolve the problems of child camel jockeys. </p><p> </p><p>Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment </p><p> </p><p>The labor law prohibits employment of persons under the age of 15 </p><p>and has special provisions for employing those 15 to 18 years of </p><p>age.  The Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is </p><p>responsible for enforcing the regulations.  Other regulations </p><p>permit employers to employ only adult foreign workers.  The UAEG </p><p>does not issue work permits for foreign workers under the age of </p><p>18 years. </p><p> </p><p>In September 2002, the UAEG began implementing a child camel </p><p>jockey ban with criminal penalties for violators up to and </p><p>including imprisonment.  The ban prohibits the use of camel </p><p>jockeys less than 15 years of age. </p><p> </p><p>Acceptable Conditions of Work </p><p> </p><p>There are a considerable number of skilled foreign nationals in </p><p>the country who are employed under favorable working conditions. </p><p>However, the country is also a destination for a large number of </p><p>unskilled workers, including more than 200,000 domestic servants, </p><p>most of them women from South and East Asia, and an even larger </p><p>number of unskilled male workers, mostly from South Asia.  These </p><p>unskilled laborers actively compete for jobs in the UAE, and some </p><p>are subject to poor working conditions. </p><p> </p><p>The standard workday is eight hours per day; the standard </p><p>workweek is six days per week; however, these standards are not </p><p>enforced strictly.  Certain types of workers, notably domestic </p><p>servants, are required to work longer than the mandated standard. </p><p>The law also provides for a minimum of 24 days per year of annual </p><p>leave plus 10 national and religious holidays.  There is no </p><p>legislated or administrative minimum wage; rather, supply and </p><p>demand determine compensation.  Compensation packages generally </p><p>provide housing or housing allowances.  In addition, other </p><p>benefits, such as homeward passage or health cards for minimal to </p><p>no-cost health care, are often provided to employees by their </p><p>employers.  The Labor and Social Affairs Ministry reviews labor </p><p>contracts and does not approve any contract that stipulates a </p><p>clearly unacceptable wage. </p><p>The Ministries of Health and of Labor and Social Affairs, </p><p>municipalities, and civil defense enforce health and safety </p><p>standards, and the Government requires every large industrial </p><p>concern to employ a certified occupational safety officer. </p><p>Contrary to popular belief, there is no law in the country that </p><p>prohibits labor outdoors when the temperature exceeds 50 degrees </p><p>Celsius.  The law does require, however, that employers provide </p><p>employees with a safe work environment. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.11.e.  Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>The UAE Free Zones today are home to approximately 5,000 </p><p>companies with a total investment estimated at more than USD $4 </p><p>billion.  Presently, 13 free trade zones operate in the UAE, and </p><p>more are in the developmental stage.  Overall, these free zones </p><p>form a vital component of the local economy, and serve as major </p><p>re-export centers to the Gulf region. </p><p> </p><p>Since UAE tariffs are low and not levied against many imports, </p><p>the chief attraction of the free zones is the waiver of the </p><p>requirement for majority local ownership.  In the free zones, </p><p>foreigners may own up to 100 percent of the equity in an </p><p>enterprise.  All free zones provide 100 percent import and export </p><p>tax exemption, 100 percent exemption from commercial levies, 100 </p><p>percent repatriation of capital and profits, multi-year leases, </p><p>easy access to sea and airports, buildings for lease, energy </p><p>connections (often at subsidized prices), and assistance in labor </p><p>recruitment.  In addition, the free zone authorities provide </p><p>significant support services, such as sponsorship, worker </p><p>housing, dining facilities, recruitment, and security for a fee. </p><p> </p><p>By far the largest and most successful of the free zones is the </p><p>Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZ) in Dubai, located 20 kilometers south </p><p>of Dubai city adjacent to the Jebel Ali Port.  Over 2,200 </p><p>companies representing 80 countries have set up shop in the JAFZ, </p><p>including numerous Fortune 500 firms. </p><p> </p><p>The JAFZ managing authority authorizes three types of licenses -- </p><p>a general license, a specific license, and a national industrial </p><p>license.  The licenses are valid while a company holds a current </p><p>lease from the free zone authority and are renewable annually as </p><p>long as the lease is in force.  The special license is issued to </p><p>companies incorporated, or otherwise legally established, within </p><p>the free zone or outside the UAE.  In such cases, no other </p><p>license is required, and the ownership of the company may be 100 </p><p>percent foreign.  The license is issued for any activity </p><p>permitted by the free zone authority, including manufacturing.  A </p><p>company with a special license can operate only in the JAFZ or </p><p>outside the UAE, but business can be undertaken and sales made in </p><p>the UAE through or to a company holding a valid Dubai Economic </p><p>Department license.  A company with a special license, however, </p><p>can itself purchase goods or services from within the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>A variety of innovative free zones in Dubai have been established </p><p>since 2000, most notably the TECOM (Technology, Electronic </p><p>Commerce and Media) free zone.  TECOM houses both Internet City </p><p>and Media City, two subdivisions which cater, respectively, to </p><p>the IT and media sectors.  TECOM offers a high bandwidth, state- </p><p>of-the-art IT infrastructure.  Current tenants of TECOM include </p><p>prominent names such as Oracle, Reuters, CNN, Hewlett Packard and </p><p>Microsoft.  Other Dubai free zones planned include Health Care </p><p>City, specializing in medical products and services, and the </p><p>Mohammed Bin Rashid Technology Park, which aims to promote </p><p>scientific research and development, and to transfer technology </p><p>throughout the region. </p><p> </p><p>13.a.11.f.  Foreign Direct Investment Statistics </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>The UAE Ministry of Planning reported that FDI inflows reached </p><p>USD $16.4 billion in 2002.  Principal foreign investors to the </p><p>UAE were from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, </p><p>India, Japan, and Germany. </p><p>The Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry notes that the </p><p>leading sectors for investment in the UAE in 2002 were (in order </p><p>of magnitude of investment): oil and gas-field machinery and </p><p>services, power and water, computer/peripherals, medical </p><p>equipment and supplies, airport development and ground equipment, </p><p>telecommunications, and franchising. </p><p> </p><p>There are no restrictions or incentives with regard to the export </p><p>of capital and outward direct investment, and UAE investment </p><p>abroad is significant.  It is conservatively estimated that the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) manages an approximate USD </p><p>$150 billion in government assets in overseas markets -- mostly </p><p>in the United States, Europe, and Asia. </p><p> </p><p>The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) </p><p>reports that net FDI flow for the UAE was $200 million during </p><p>2000, and net negative flow of $156 million in 2001.  Official </p><p>UAE statistics on FDI flows are not available. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
