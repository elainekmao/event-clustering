DIFFERING </p><p>WARTIME EXPERIENCES IN VRBOVSKO AND OGULIN, ONLY 30 </p><p>KM APART, HAVE COLORED SERB/CROAT RELATIONSHIPS IN </p><p>THE TWO DISTRICTS FOR YEARS TO COME.

SITTING DOWN WITH SERB AND CROAT REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>IN VRBOVSKO PROVIDED SOME HOPE THAT ALL WAS NOT </p><p>LOST.  AS WE DISCUSSED ISSUE AFTER THORNY ISSUE THAT </p><p>HAVE PLAGUED SERB/CROAT RELATIONS IN THE FORMER </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA, IT APPEARED TO US THAT THE TWO SERBS AND </p><p>THREE CROATS MEETING WITH US HAD BEEN OVER THIS </p><p>GROUND BEFORE.  THE WARTIME EXPERIENCE IN THE </p><p>VRBOVSKO AREA WAS, WHILE NOT WITHOUT TENSION, LARGELY </p><p>DEVOID OF ANY CONFLICT.  THERE WAS NEVER A JNA BASE </p><p>IN THE DISTRICT, OFTEN THE FOCUS OF INITIAL FIGHTING </p><p>IN OTHER PARTS OF CROATIA, SERB VILLAGERS NEVER SET </p><p>UP BARRICADES, AND THE FRONT LINE WAS FAR ENOUGH AWAY </p><p>TO KEEP THE DISTRICT FROM RECEIVING ANY SHELLING. </p><p>THIS COMBINATION OF FACTORS CONSPIRED TO ALLOW </p><p>REASONABLE SERBS AND CROATS TO PREVAIL IN VRBOVSKO. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  TWO OTHER FACTORS WORKED TO HOLD THE AREA </p><p>TOGETHER.  ONE WAS POLITICAL AFFILIATION.  OF THE </p><p>FOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WE MET WITH (2 SERBS </p><p>AND 2 CROATS), TWO (ONE EACH) WERE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>PARTY FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGES (SDP - FORMER </p><p>COMMUNISTS), ONE SERB JOINED THE SERBIAN DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PARTY (SDS) FOLLOWING THE APRIL 1990 ELECTIONS, AND </p><p>THE OTHER CROAT WAS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PARTY. </p><p>PRESIDENT TUDJMAN\'S RULING CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION </p><p>(HDZ) WAS NOT REPRESENTED IN THIS GROUP.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THIS WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00954  02 OF 08  111236Z </p><p>ACCOMPLISHED, LOCAL POLITICAL MOVEMENTS HAD CEASED </p><p>PARTY ACTIVITIES DURING THE WAR IN ORDER TO KEEP THE </p><p>PEACE AROUND VRBOVSKO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00954  03 OF 08  111237Z </p><p>ACTION AID-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  C-01     DODE-00  CISA-02  EB-01 </p><p>      EUR-01   HA-09    H-01     INRE-00  INR-01   IO-19    LAB-04 </p><p>      L-03     ADS-00   NEA-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PM-01    P-01 </p><p>      RP-10    SCT-03   SDEL-01  SIL-01   SNP-01   SP-01    SR-01 </p><p>      SS-01    STR-20   TRSE-00  T-01       /089W </p><p>                  ------------------3D7A3D  111245Z /38 </p><p>P 111005Z JUN 92 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 1124 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY HELSINKI </p><p>AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD </p><p>AMEMBASSY KIEV </p><p>AMEMBASSY LISBON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUXEMBOURG </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00954  03 OF 08  111237Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USIA WASHDC 1623 </p><p>USEC BRUSSELS </p><p> COMSIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON//N24// </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GM//ECJ3/ECJ5// </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC 0516 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 08 ZAGREB 00954 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSBM; ISLAMABAD FOR POL/JPOGUE </p><p>- </p><p>HELSINKI FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p>- </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID FOR EUR/RME AND FHA/OFDA/DRD </p><p>- </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, PREF, PHUM, MOPS, HR, YO </p><p>SUBJECT:  SERBS AND CROATS IN GORSKI KOTAR:  A TALE </p><p>OF TWO DISTRICTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE SECOND REASON IS THAT SERBS AND CROATS DID </p><p>NOT FLEE THE VRBOVSKO DISTRICT AS THEY DID IN </p><p>OTHERS.  BOTH GROUPS STUCK IT OUT THROUGH THE </p><p>DIFFICULTIES AND NOW BOTH SIDES ASSERT THAT A CERTAIN </p><p>NORMALIZATION IS RETURNING TO THE SERB-CROAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00954  03 OF 08  111237Z </p><p>RELATIONSHIP THERE.  IN THE DISTRICT AS A WHOLE, THE </p><p>POPULATION BREAKDOWN IS ABOUT 65 PERCENT CROAT, 35 </p><p>PERCENT SERB.  NATURALLY, SOME VILLAGES ARE 100 </p><p>PERCENT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AS IS THE CASE FOR </p><p>GOMIRJE AND SRPSKE MORAVICE (BOTH NEARLY 100 PERCENT </p><p>SERB). </p><p> </p><p>VRBOVSKO:  NOT WITHOUT ITS PROBLEMS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  BOTH SIDES ADMITTED TO SERIOUS STRAINS IN THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY BLAMED ON SMALL GROUPS OF </p><p>CROATIAN AND SERBIAN "EXTREMISTS".  "EVERYONE IS </p><p>ARMED," SAID LEADERS OF BOTH COMMUNITIES, LEADING TO </p><p>THE PROMISE OF MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION IN CASE </p><p>OF ANY BREAKDOWN IN THE CURRENT PEACE.  SOME OF THE </p><p>CAUSES OF INSTABILITY IN THE DISTRICT OVER THE LAST </p><p>10 MONTHS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: </p><p>- </p><p>--  IN VRBOVSKO, PRIOR TO THE WAR, THERE WERE 18 </p><p>POLICEMEN, HALF OF WHOM WERE SERBS.  SINCE THE WAR, </p><p>THE TOTAL NUMBER HAS INCREASED TO 62, TEN PERCENT OF </p><p>WHOM ARE SERBS.  WHILE SERBS HAVE NOT BEEN FIRED FROM </p><p>THE POLICE FORCE, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN HIRED EITHER, </p><p>CONTRARY TO A NATIONAL REGULATION WHICH REQUIRES </p><p>DISTRICTS TO HIRE BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF THE </p><p>POPULATION WHICH IDENTIFIES ITSELF WITH DIFFERENT </p><p>ETHNIC GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>--  SERB LEADERS IN VRBOVSKO CONFIRMED THAT SERBS </p><p>EMPLOYED BY THE CROATIAN RAILROAD FROM THAT AREA HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00954  03 OF 08  111237Z </p><p>LOST JOBS RECENTLY SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR </p><p>NATIONALITY.
