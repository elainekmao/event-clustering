<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 002521 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, MARR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: THE TURKISH GENERAL STAFF: A FRACTIOUS AND SULLEN </p><p>POLITICAL COALITION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 418 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1350 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 2122 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 2330 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 1367 </p><p>     F. 02 ANKARA 2914 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson.  Reasons: 1.5 (b, </p><p>d, X6). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: As refs (A-E) note, Turkish General Staff </p><p>(TGS) remains deeply involved in day-to-day political life </p><p>and policymaking, with attendant strains and divisions among </p><p>senior military leaders over domestic and foreign policy </p><p>issues.  These divisions are more visible today than at any </p><p>time in the past, according to our contacts, and will cause </p><p>additional friction and delays on cooperation on operational </p><p>political and diplomatic issues of concern to the U.S.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Numerous long-time contacts across the political </p><p>spectrum have recently shared their concerns at rivalries and </p><p>unevenness in TGS decision-making and the detrimental effect </p><p>these divisions are having on Turkey\'s willingness to work </p><p>with the U.S.  These contacts (strictly protect) include, but </p><p>are not limited to: (1) former Turkish NSC staffer and </p><p>executive director of the Advanced Strategy Center Faruk </p><p>Demir, who in his previous career in military intelligence </p><p>spent significant time with now-ranking TGS generals; (2) </p><p>deputy chairman of the Turkish Union of Chambers Mehmet </p><p>Balduk; (3) the leadership of Fethullah Gulen\'s </p><p>(Islam-oriented but connected to the Establishment) ISHAD </p><p>group; (4-7) senior journalists, among them "Jane\'s Defence </p><p>Weekly" correspondent Lale Sariibrahimoglu, "Hurriyet" </p><p>columnist Cuneyt Ulsever, "Tercuman" columnist Cengiz Candar, </p><p>and TV anchorman Akif Beki, who has excellent access to </p><p>top-level GOT officials including P.M. Erdogan and F.M. Gul; </p><p>(8) the owner-CEO of a major media conglomerate; (9) Kemal </p><p>Koprulu, chairman of the Ari Movement, a leading </p><p>Establishmentarian NGO; and (10) a former member of </p><p>Parliament with excellent access to parliamentary, Kurdish </p><p>nationalist, and Islamist circles.  They consistently </p><p>describe a TGS both riven by factionalism and projecting a </p><p>heightened sense of suspicion toward the U.S. to degrees not </p><p>previously seen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Corporat(ist) Culture... </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Our contacts remind us that there are, of course, </p><p>certain institutional instincts which bind the TGS despite </p><p>personal rivalries.  These include: (1) an unwavering </p><p>commitment to Kemalism (the worship of Ataturk and belief in </p><p>the military\'s duty as the pre-eminent, intimidating </p><p>guardians of the State, beyond civilian control); (2) a rigid </p><p>corporate culture which does not tolerate individual </p><p>initiative at lower ranks; (3) stiff adherence to </p><p>"secularism" and fear of anything more than a cultural </p><p>identification of Turkey as Islamic; (4) an inward-looking </p><p>culture keenly protective of its ample subsidies, off-budget </p><p>funds, large pensions and cushy sinecures (Lale </p><p>Sariibrahimoglu has given us concrete examples), and other </p><p>privileges; (5) deep suspicion of Kurds; and (6) resistance </p><p>to any practical Cyprus settlement.  Our contacts also </p><p>emphasize (7) the cancer of corruption in the military and </p><p>the TGS\'s shared unwillingness to clean up: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- procurement scandals (many contacts cite insistent stories </p><p>of payoffs on the Israeli M-60 tank and F-4 fighter upgrade </p><p>contracts; a senior expatriate rep for a major Western </p><p>defense contractor also gave us details of a party for </p><p>Turkish military officers, attended by numerous Russian </p><p>call-girls and hosted by notorious pro-Russian businessman </p><p>Ali Sen, the Turkey rep for Bell Helicopter rival Kamov and </p><p>other Russian businesses, in August 2002 in the seaside </p><p>resort of Bodrum); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- conflicts of interest involving Turkish military </p><p>properties in Northern Cyprus and links to drug smuggling in </p><p>Turkey\'s Southeast; Demir also recounted to us his unwilling </p><p>involvement, while in military intelligence, in a deal </p><p>organized within the Turkish military to sell medicine to the </p><p>PKK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The TGS also harshly resents any implication that it </p><p>is not united in its views: in reaction to a "Washington </p><p>Post" story which looked at rivalries among the TGS </p><p>leadership, TGS Chief Ozkok on April 10 issued through </p><p>State-run TRT criticism of the story as inappropriate </p><p>particularly "at a time when the country is going through a </p><p>very serious period due to developments in Iraq."  Our </p><p>contacts uniformly interpret Ozkok\'s statement as a general </p><p>warning to Turks to avoid similar assessments.  However, </p><p>three leading journalists (Akif Beki, foreign policy </p><p>columnist Murat Yetkin, and CNN-Turk foreign policy reporter </p><p>Barcin Yinanc) subsequently separately told Embassy press </p><p>officer that they admired the Post story -- all the more so </p><p>since, in each one\'s opinion, no Turkish journalist would </p><p>have dared to write it.  In terms of military intimidation of </p><p>journalists, both Lale Sariibrahimoglu of "Jane\'s Defence </p><p>Weekly" and Cuneyt Ulsever of "Hurriyet" have recently told </p><p>us they fear for their lives as a result of their public </p><p>criticism of the military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>...But Personal Rivalries </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Despite this TGS profession of unanimity of views, </p><p>there are now three main rival groups, according to our </p><p>contacts.  First, the "Atlanticists," who accept, whether </p><p>enthusiastically or not, that Turkey\'s strategic interest </p><p>lies in maintaining firm ties to the U.S. and NATO.  Second, </p><p>the rigid "Nationalists," who resent the need to maintain </p><p>ties to the U.S., oppose Turkey\'s EU candidacy, prefer to </p><p>trust no one (including the U.S., which they are convinced </p><p>intends to support an independent Kurdish state carved out of </p><p>Iraq), and insist on unbending maintenance of the Kemalist </p><p>State.  Third, "Eurasianists," who, without understanding the </p><p>Russia-dominated nature of the "Eurasia" concept, have long </p><p>sought an alternative to the U.S. and are considering closer </p><p>relations with Russia or some as-yet ill-defined grouping </p><p>including Russia and Iran or Russia and China.  Part of the </p><p>motivating force is the "Rappallo Syndrome," the sense that </p><p>Turkey and Russia are alone, equally victims of mistreatment </p><p>and disrespect by an arrogant West (ref F).  In addition, as </p><p>Demir has noted to us, another motivation for the livelier </p><p>interest in Russia is the satisfaction among "Eurasia" </p><p>advocates in the TGS that Russia shares the same preference </p><p>for "stability" and will not press the Turkish State to </p><p>continue to democratize.  In the intramural TGS political </p><p>contest, the "Eurasianists" and "Nationalists" are </p><p>provisional allies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Our contacts see the main figures as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- TGS Chief Gen. Hilmi Ozkok is more democratically-oriented </p><p>and more of an Atlanticist than any of his recent </p><p>predecessors.  A principled man who has upset people when he </p><p>has stuck to those principles, Ozkok believes a </p><p>democratically elected government needs to bear the </p><p>responsibility for political decisions.  He is, however, </p><p>largely isolated, with few if any real allies among the top </p><p>brass.  In a bid to avoid confrontation with his more </p><p>strong-willed and hard-line associates, Ozkok fails to assert </p><p>his own views: one contact acknowledged that Ozkok exhibits a </p><p>"Hamlet-like" uncertainty.  Examples of this were Ozkok\'s </p><p>failures: (1) to overcome TGS delaying tactics against U.S. </p><p>operational plans; and (2) to force TGS colleagues to inform </p><p>the government of the military\'s own planning or the logic of </p><p>U.S. strategy and plans in the crucial run-up to parliament\'s </p><p>March 1 (failed) vote on the U.S. and Turkish troop </p><p>deployment motion.  Ozkok did seek permission to go public </p><p>asking that Turkey support the U.S. prior to the vote and was </p><p>directed not to by President Sezer.  Only when the press, in </p><p>uncharacteristic fashion, began to criticize him afterward </p><p>did he make a public statement that the TGS supported the </p><p>U.S. request.  Ultimately, however, Ozkok backing for the </p><p>U.S. northern option was five days late and $6 billion short. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Ozkok is opposed by a coterie of senior Army generals from </p><p>the rigid-nationalist and Eurasianist camps, including most </p><p>notably: (1) Deputy TGS Chief Gen. Yasar Buyukanit; (2) Gen. </p><p>Aytac Yalman, the Land Forces Commander, the position from </p><p>which future TGS Chiefs are usually elevated, though Yalman </p><p>is likely to be retired; (3) First Army Commander Gen. Cetin </p><p>Dogan; (4) Second Army Commander Gen. Fevzi Turkeri, who, </p><p>according to Demir, has long used the nationalist socialist </p><p>weekly "Aydinlik" to leak scurrilous, anti-American stories </p><p>(e.g., accusations that the U.S. materially supports </p><p>PKK/KADEK); (5) General Tuncer Kilinc, the secretary-general </p><p>of the powerful NSC and an outspoken advocate of stronger </p><p>Turkish ties to Russia and Iran (ref F); (6) Gen. Sener </p><p>Eruygur, Commander of the Jandarma -- an arm, the sources </p><p>note, to which the TGS routinely resorts for investigative </p><p>and "policing" purposes.  We have also heard that J-3 Lt. </p><p>Gen. Koksal Karabay, touted as a possible future TGS Chief, </p><p>is associated with this group.  Ozkok\'s most ardent and </p><p>liberal supporters (typified by the J-5 Air Force Lt. Gen. </p><p>Resat Turgut) tend to be less assertive than the </p><p>Nationalists/Eurasianists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The hard-liners are supported from the outside by </p><p>influential retired senior officers including Gen. Doga </p><p>Aktulga (who participated in the 1997 "post-modern" coup </p><p>d\'etat against the then Islamist-led government); Gen. Teoman </p><p>Koman, at one time director of the national intelligence </p><p>organization (MIT); and Ozkok\'s predecessor Huseyin </p><p>Kivrikoglu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The hard line is also carefully tended by the War Academy </p><p>in Istanbul, the site for Kilinc\'s pro-Russia/Iran comments </p><p>at the annual national security conference in March 2002 and </p><p>for an extraordinarily bitter series of anti-U.S. comments by </p><p>Kivrikoglu, Dogan and a dozen other senior Turkish officers </p><p>in reaction against the presentation by the Dean of NDU\'s War </p><p>College at the March 2003 conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>The TGS and U.S. Interests </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) The TGS\'s prolonged political opposition to the U.S. </p><p>Iraq strategy, continued operational foot-dragging, and </p><p>continuing accusations that the U.S. has an anti-Turkish </p><p>agenda in Iraq have prompted more Turks to ask more questions </p><p>about how committed the TGS is to relations with the U.S.  In </p><p>addition, with the generals coming under more public </p><p>scrutiny, TGS contacts have begun to admit to us what many </p><p>other contacts have concluded: that "some" in the senior </p><p>leadership are more interested in undermining AK party and </p><p>the Kurds than in preserving the strategic partnership with </p><p>the U.S. (ref E). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Given the current political environment, friction in </p><p>the TGS will continue to compound the Turkish State\'s </p><p>resentment toward the U.S. and reluctance to make helpful </p><p>decisions on questions of central concern to us in the fluid </p><p>period ahead.  Moreover, strains between the top brass and </p><p>more fiery elements lower down the chain of command could, as </p><p>they have done repeatedly in the past (most recently in </p><p>1997), emerge as a political problem for the leadership.  We </p><p>have some evidence that Ozkok wants to bide his time on </p><p>reestablishing solid cooperation with the U.S. until his </p><p>opponents in the TGS retire.  However, as so often in Turkey, </p><p>biding one\'s time becomes an end in itself as outside events </p><p>pass by at their own, swifter pace.  Our contacts thus expect </p><p>that any fundamental changes to the current military </p><p>domination of the Turkish State system, as well as the </p><p>regaining of dynamism in the U.S.-Turkish relationship, will </p><p>require both the retirement of the hard-liners and, </p><p>especially, the development of a new cadre of modern, </p><p>forward-looking officers. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
