<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001943 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2017 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: IBB, ALIYU AND THE RACE FOR NIGERIA\'S PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1850 </p><p>     B. LAGOS 1273 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON:  1.5(B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: IBB is not running, for now, and neither is </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed, according to several political insiders.  But </p><p>both retired generals are deeply frustrated with incumbent </p><p>retired general Olusegun Obasanjo.  There are pressures on </p><p>IBB to run, but he carries heavy baggage.  If the North can </p><p>coalesce around a consensus team, perhaps one headed by a </p><p>career civilian, OO will face a campaign trail as potholed as </p><p>most Nigerian roads.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Olusegun Obasanjo came to power in 1999 with the </p><p>support of fellow former military head of state Ibrahim </p><p>Badamasi Babangida (IBB) and an erstwhile Customs officer </p><p>named Atiku Abubakar.  Atiku had inherited the political </p><p>machinery of the late Shehu Musa Yar\'Adua, OO\'s deputy </p><p>following the assassination of Murtala Mohammed.  Unlike </p><p>Obasanjo, Yar\'Adua did not survive imprisonment by their </p><p>former subordinate, Sani Abacha, but his Peoples Democratic </p><p>Movement (PDM) evolved into the core of today\'s ruling </p><p>People\'s Democratic Party (PDP).  Playing a strong supporting </p><p>role in the IBB camp was retired Lieutenant General Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed (political folklore has it that Mohammed helped </p><p>convince a skeptical Obasanjo that IBB was sincere when he </p><p>stated that he would support Obasanjo for president in 1999). </p><p> Aliyu, Oladipo Diya and Sani Abacha comprised the </p><p>triumvirate of active generals that told Interim National </p><p>Government Chairman Chief Ernest Shonekan to resign in late </p><p>1994.  Abacha outmaneuvered Aliyu, taking the top job and </p><p>retiring his fellow Northerner.  Diya held the number two job </p><p>under Abacha until he, like Obasanjo and Yar\'Adua, was </p><p>convicted of coup-plotting.  Today, Aliyu is Obasanjo\'s </p><p>National Security Advisor, Atiku is Vice President, and IBB </p><p>looms darkly in the background -- perennial potential </p><p>candidate, the dream of some and nightmare of others. </p><p>Together, they form the new (retired) generals\' triumvirate </p><p>and will figure critically in Obasanjo\'s prospects for a </p><p>second term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) From about September of last year, Nigeria was awash </p><p>with rumors that Obasanjo might drop Atiku in favor of a </p><p>running mate from the Northwest.  Kaduna Governor Makarfi was </p><p>prominently mentioned, and his staff were busily preparing </p><p>their boss.  The intensity of speculation grew as Obasanjo </p><p>repeatedly pushed back the official announcement of his </p><p>re-election plans.  Obasanjo\'s eventual announcement that he </p><p>planned to retain Atiku on the ticket seemed lukewarm to many </p><p>observers here.  Atiku himself privately acknowledged to CDA </p><p>June 24 that there had been some strains but averred that </p><p>everything had now been worked out.  Another political </p><p>insider commented that cooler political minds had prevailed </p><p>in the struggle for Obasanjo\'s attention, convincing him that </p><p>he could not win without the political machinery Atiku </p><p>controls.  Atiku privately alluded to this reality, noting </p><p>with some pride that this control and his winning the day on </p><p>the question of whether to fight for every state (septel) had </p><p>helped to attenuate political violence during the electoral </p><p>cycle thus far. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) More recently, rumors have been rife that Aliyu had </p><p>plans to run against his boss, either as a stalking horse for </p><p>IBB or as IBB\'s candidate.  According to a political figure </p><p>close to Aliyu and IBB, Obasanjo decided to check out those </p><p>rumors by paying some Northern political figures, including </p><p>at least one governor, to approach Aliyu and urge him to run. </p><p> One of the men approached apparently told Aliyu.  In early </p><p>June, the source continued, Aliyu asked for a meeting with </p><p>Obasanjo and Atiku (as witness) and complained bitterly that </p><p>Obasanjo had lacked sufficient respect for him to ask him his </p><p>intentions directly.  He had put his life at risk to support </p><p>Obasanjo and had faithfully implemented Obasanjo\'s decisions, </p><p>Aliyu reportedly continued, so he deserved better than this </p><p>sort of skullduggery.  Obasanjo quickly apologized, the </p><p>source concluded, but had lost stature in the eyes of both </p><p>Aliyu and Atiku as a result. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) CDA mentioned the rumors to Aliyu during a June 25 </p><p>meeting and asked what he thought.  Aliyu said he worked for </p><p>the President and was a member of the ruling party.  He said </p><p>the rumors arose from a list the Arewa Consultative Forum </p><p>(ACF) had compiled of possible Northern contestants.  ACF had </p><p>no one\'s mandate to produce such a list, Aliyu continued, but </p><p>its existence had led the backers of several nascent parties </p><p>to ask him to join them.  He was not interested in joining </p><p>any party other than the PDP and had rebuffed all entreaties. </p><p> COMMENT:  We note that Aliyu did not specifically rule out </p><p>running for President.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Several players from different parts of the political </p><p>spectrum have told us recently that IBB is not planning to </p><p>run against Obasanjo.  However, an occasional IBB adviser </p><p>told Consulate General Lagos (ref B) that the former Head of </p><p>State would announce his candidacy on August 17, and two of </p><p>the newly-registered political parties (NDP and UNPP) want </p><p>IBB as their flag-bearer.  IBB is also nervous about the </p><p>Buhari candidacy, fearing that the man he overthrew in 1985 </p><p>would probably order his arrest within 24 hours of assuming </p><p>office.  Babangida\'s strong ties to the elite would trump </p><p>Buhari\'s popularity with the Northern masses and preclude the </p><p>tiny possibility of Buhari (who would have great difficulty </p><p>attracting votes outside the far North) actually winning the </p><p>election.  IBB is renowned for changing stories to suit his </p><p>changing audiences, so interlocutors tend to hear what IBB </p><p>thinks they want to hear.  He\'s not running yet, but he\'s </p><p>clearly keeping his options open. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF) Meanwhile, British Deputy High Commissioner met </p><p>with Atiku, who said that the "triumvirate" would continue to </p><p>support Obasanjo for the time being.  However, if he (Atiku) </p><p>decided to pull up stakes, he was sure Aliyu would come with </p><p>him.  If Atiku and Aliyu were to switch their support to IBB, </p><p>a prospect we find unlikely given Atiku\'s own ambitions, OO </p><p>would have a very hard time winning anything resembling an </p><p>open and transparent election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Atiku told CDA privately that he felt the </p><p>Obasanjo-Atiku ticket would prevail.  But Emeka Ihedioha, one </p><p>of his strategists, said immediately afterward that the </p><p>ticket was in deep trouble in the South; there were only </p><p>seven where the team could feel "comfortable."  Outside the </p><p>Northeast, the North was mostly hostile territory - a point </p><p>on which most observers are in agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF) Party Chairman Audu Ogbeh thought it likely IBB </p><p>was not himself quite sure which way to jump.  Ogbeh pointed </p><p>out that IBB carried heavy baggage from his years in office. </p><p>Aside from the damage he inflicted on national institutions </p><p>(a point that influential Northern elder Liman Ciroma often </p><p>makes), IBB faced serious unresolved human rights charges, </p><p>notably complicity in the assassination of journalist Dele </p><p>Giwa.  Moreover, Ogbeh continued, IBB\'s financial resources </p><p>were not of the magnitude many assumed; he had lost a fortune </p><p>when Aliyu Dasuki suddenly died (Aliyu Mohammed subsequently </p><p>married Dasuki\'s widow, Jamila) and probably could not </p><p>finance a Presidential campaign without significant help from </p><p>his friends.  Ogbeh said IBB had specifically disavowed any </p><p>interest in the 2003 election in a recent private chat, but </p><p>Ogbeh just as quickly added that IBB could not be trusted to </p><p>speak frankly about his intentions.  Ogbeh sharply criticized </p><p>President Obasanjo, however, saying that his penchant for </p><p>international travel and inattention to waste, corruption and </p><p>decaying terms of trade left the PDP vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT: Because IBB tends to say what people want </p><p>to hear, he has become many different things to different </p><p>people.  His support in certain circles runs strong because </p><p>various groupings are vying to make him their leader.  If IBB </p><p>eventually decides to run, he will have to choose his venue </p><p>from among three parties - ANPP, UNPP and NDP.  The former </p><p>offers him a way to knock Buhari (his personal nightmare) out </p><p>of the running early.  The other two are filled with people </p><p>desperate for his profile and presumed deep pockets as the </p><p>vehicle to ride to larger electoral success.  Once he picks </p><p>(assuming he eventually decides to run), some of the </p><p>praise-singers will line up behind other candidates.  He will </p><p>have to face more scrutiny and start answering at least a few </p><p>questions concretely.  In the process, some who now see him </p><p>as their political messiah will grow disillusioned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Conversely, Obasanjo and Atiku are not in quite as </p><p>bad political shape as Ihedioha thinks.  Yes, they are deeply </p><p>unpopular, and that is because their government has failed to </p><p>deliver material "democracy dividends" to most Nigerians. </p><p>But the opposition candidates who have announced intentions </p><p>thus far manifestly lack the potential to win national office </p><p>(Buhari has high name recognition but cannot overcome strong </p><p>negatives).  Obasanjo and Atiku suffer because the country is </p><p>in poor shape and, as its leaders, they are being blamed.  At </p><p>some point, parties will hold primaries and conventions and </p><p>nominate flag-bearers.  To win, these individuals will have </p><p>to overcome the powerful perquisites available to incumbents, </p><p>and they will have to show disillusioned Nigerians why they </p><p>can do better than the incumbents have done.  Since most, if </p><p>not all, of the likely challengers are tainted by service </p><p>with past non-performing governments, that task may prove </p><p>difficult to accomplish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The first 11 paragraphs of this message focus on </p><p>generals and retired generals.  Generally, Nigerians are </p><p>tiring of retired generals.  Cynical calculations of regional </p><p>balance will probably govern the selection of those who will </p><p>seriously challenge Obasanjo and Atiku for national office. </p><p>A Southeast-Northwest axis (ref A) would be the best choice </p><p>from that depressingly familiar perspective.  But the party </p><p>that can come up with strong candidates who meet the needs of </p><p>regional balance while avoiding the temptation to recycle </p><p>former military rulers into the top slots of its ticket may </p><p>find it has what is needed to resonate with the electorate </p><p>and give the incumbents a run for their money. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
