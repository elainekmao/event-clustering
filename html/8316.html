Four members of DART Field Team West traveled to Ad </p><p>Diwaniyah, Qadisiyah governorate between 21 and 22 May.  The </p><p>DART met with the local Governorate Support Team, various </p><p>CMOC members, the Director General of the MOH, a team of </p><p>doctors from the local maternal/pediatric hospital, WFP, </p><p>Iraqi Red Crescent, and DART implementing partner Mercy </p><p>Corps. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Overall, Ad Diwaniyah is facing a situation similar to </p><p>most other cities in the upper south.  Basic services </p><p>(electricity, water, health care, PDS, etc.) have returned </p><p>to pre-war levels.  However, these systems are vulnerable </p><p>for a variety of reasons (lack of re-supply for health </p><p>facilities, lack of chlorine and spare parts to repair </p><p>equipment in water/sewage systems, etc.), and there are </p><p>pockets of need in outlying villages - particularly with </p><p>regard to water and sanitation.  In addition, there are </p><p>numerous opportunities for transition initiatives that would </p><p>have a quick and positive impact on the community.  The city </p><p>is not experiencing an immediate humanitarian emergency, but </p><p>is faced with chronic vulnerabilities, which threaten to </p><p>become worse given disruptions to centralized distribution </p><p>systems and centralized decision making.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>GOVERNORATE SUPPORT TEAM MEETING </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART participated in two Governorate Support Team </p><p>(GST) meetings during its visit to Ad Diwaniyah.  The GST is </p><p>currently transitioning from a Marine battalion to an Army </p><p>Civil Affairs unit.  The Marines have been very active in </p><p>standing up the local government and the justice system; </p><p>ensuring that water, sewage, and garbage collection are </p><p>functioning; collecting and disposing of arms and unexploded </p><p>ordnance (UXOs); and rehabilitating schools. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Coalition forces have begun using seized Ba\'ath party </p><p>funds to finance the rehabilitation of the city hall.  City </p><p>hall was thoroughly looted, but only after former-Ba\'ath </p><p>party officials set fire to government documents inside the </p><p>building.  The rehabilitation is focused on one wing of the </p><p>building and will provide 17 offices and two conference </p><p>rooms by mid-June.  These funds are also being used to </p><p>rehabilitate a "model school".  In the meantime, the GST is </p><p>soliciting U.S. Department of Defense ODAHCA funds for </p><p>several projects ranging from support to police units to </p><p>repair of city sewage systems. </p><p> </p><p>5.  There are currently no non-governmental organizations </p><p>(NGOs) based in Ad Diwaniyah, although Mercy Corps </p><p>International (MCI) and Solidarites have shown interest in </p><p>working there (see below). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>VISIT TO AD DIWANIYAH PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Doctors at the Maternal and Child Hospital of Ad </p><p>Diwaniyah reported that the hospital suffered from a number </p><p>of problems, including no staff salaries, a lack of some </p><p>essential drugs and oxygen, cooling system breakdowns, a </p><p>shortage of fuel for ambulances, and insecurity.  However, </p><p>the hospital\'s interim director admitted to the DART that </p><p>many of the hospital\'s current problems also existed before </p><p>the war.  "We have almost the same problems; the same </p><p>difficulties," he said.  The hospital has 260 beds and 24 </p><p>specialist doctors, 14 whom are women. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The doctors estimated that 70 percent of the 100 to 150 </p><p>children they treat daily suffer from diarrhea, and about </p><p>one third of these patients have severe diarrhea.  They said </p><p>this number is comparable to rates of previous years. </p><p>Doctors said there was adequate supply of water in Ad </p><p>Diwaniyah, but that the quality was poor, leading to </p><p>diarrhea problems.  Poor rural residents are often forced to </p><p>obtain water straight from canals.  Doctors said there used </p><p>to be diarrhea-prevention and other health-education </p><p>messages broadcast on the now-defunct Iraqi television </p><p>stations. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The hospital\'s nutrition rehabilitation center closed </p><p>one year ago because deliveries of therapeutic milk and high </p><p>protein biscuits stopped. A few days ago, CARE delivered 40 </p><p>cartons of lactose-free milk, biscuits, cheese, blankets, </p><p>and detergents.  Medecins Sans Frontieres-Holland, the </p><p>International Rescue Committee (IRC), and MCI had also </p><p>visited over the last three weeks.  There are approximately </p><p>20 to 30 babies born at the hospital each day, though </p><p>doctors said the majority of babies in Ad Diwaniyah are </p><p>delivered in special birthing facilities, often with </p><p>assistance from traditional birth attendants. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Doctors said up to 80 percent of their female adult </p><p>patients had anemia, and that most babies were born </p><p>underweight.  The number of female patients at the hospital </p><p>has greatly declined since the war because of medication </p><p>shortages.  As a result, admissions at private clinics have </p><p>increased.  Doctors said the hospital\'s electricity supply </p><p>was adequate, albeit erratic, and that its immunization </p><p>program was ongoing.   The hospital had telephone </p><p>communications within Ad Diwaniyah only. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Qadisiyah\'s Minister of Health said that all the </p><p>hospitals in the governorate would hold departmental </p><p>elections next week to choose hospital directors, and chiefs </p><p>of nursing, pharmacies, engineering, and other sections. </p><p>The Minister also said that the Ministry of Health (MOH) in </p><p>Baghdad instructed health facilities nationwide to carry out </p><p>in-house elections. </p><p> </p><p>11.  To deal with donations, he said the three hospitals in </p><p>Ad Diwaniyah had each set up special teams to accept and </p><p>distribute donated drugs and medical supplies.  The </p><p>governorate drug warehouse is operating, but has not </p><p>received any drugs from Baghdad since the war.  The Minister </p><p>said it would be preferable to donate drugs directly to the </p><p>hospitals rather than to the drug warehouse.  He added that </p><p>MOH Baghdad informed him all future MOH drugs would be </p><p>distributed to health facilities at no cost, and that </p><p>hospitals would soon be forbidden to charge patients for </p><p>drugs.  Currently, most hospitals charge patients a 30 </p><p>percent markup to cover their overhead costs. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>MCI IN AD DIWANIYAH </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Team West met with DART cooperative agreement partner </p><p>MCI in Diwanyah to discuss potential interventions, </p><p>including essential drug distribution and water and </p><p>sanitation activities in and around the city.  MCI suggested </p><p>an integrated health and water and sanitation project could </p><p>significantly reduce the debilitating childhood diarrhea </p><p>problem in Ad Diwaniyah and its surrounding villages.  MCI </p><p>has visited Ad Diwaniyah several times, and is now </p><p>establishing an office there.  It will soon send a water and </p><p>sanitation engineer, a health officer, and support staff to </p><p>focus on developing and implementing projects. </p><p> </p><p>13.  MCI established its first base in neighboring Al Kut </p><p>rather than in Ad Diwaniyah because the security situation </p><p>was more permissive there.  It said it will coordinate its </p><p>potential activities closely with city and governorate </p><p>officials, Solidarites, which will carry out rural water </p><p>projects, the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance (ORHA), Bechtel, the Governorate Support Team, </p><p>and CARE, which conducts activities in Ad Diwaniyah.  ORHA </p><p>and Bechtel representatives visited water and sewage plants </p><p>in Ad Diwaniyah Wednesday, and Bechtel expressed interest in </p><p>improving water and sanitation services in the city. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>JUSTICE ISSUES IN AD DIWANIYAH </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The DART spoke with the Coalition officer who is </p><p>transitioning out as the justice officer (an army lawyer </p><p>will be taking over for him).  The Coalition officer </p><p>explained that things are moving along smoothly in the </p><p>region - approximately 33 judges in Qadisiyah have been </p><p>recently appointed, 113 criminals have been through the </p><p>interim justice system in the last three days in Diwanyah, </p><p>and a makeshift prison has been established since the </p><p>original prison was destroyed in the war.  His major concern </p><p>is the lack of police in town and continued lawlessness, </p><p>especially in the outlying areas.  The military was planning </p><p>to begin a training of trainers program for police officers </p><p>the next day.  Thus far, approximately 25 recruits will be </p><p>attending the training.  The officer has seen no significant </p><p>evidence of acts of retribution thus far, but looting sprees </p><p>and peaceful protests continue.  The officer also reported </p><p>that a small mass grave was found in the former Ba\'ath Party </p><p>security complex.  The bodies of 12 men were found bound and </p><p>blindfolded.  According to the officer, his superiors deemed </p><p>this site a "humanitarian issue" and not evidence of a war </p><p>crime and turned over the bodies to local religious leaders, </p><p>who in turn, returned them to their families. </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>IRAQI RED CRESCENT SOCEITY </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  The DART briefly visited with the Director of the Iraqi </p><p>Red Crescent Society (IRCS).  IRCS is comprised of eight </p><p>permanent staff and over 100 volunteers.  Most worked </p><p>throughout the war, assisting war wounded and vulnerable </p><p>families (including those who lost their homes during the </p><p>war.)  IRCS is not currently working on particular projects </p><p>because of lack of funds.  They are mostly focusing on </p><p>delivering donations of food, non-food items, and medicine </p><p>(from ICRC and others) to the local elder care institution, </p><p>and local hospitals and orphanages.  IRCS has forged a very </p><p>good relationship with MCI and explained that upon the </p><p>mayor\'s request, MCI\'s presence in town was announced on </p><p>local television and radio. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>16.  The DART met with WFP, representatives from the Civil </p><p>Military Operations Center (CMOC), and Ministry of Trade </p><p>(MOT) managers to discuss the public distribution system </p><p>(PDS) in Qadisiyah governorate and to determine possible </p><p>bottlenecks that would disrupt the planned 1 June PDS start </p><p>date.  The DART did not identify any major problems in </p><p>Qadisiyah that would threaten to delay the start date. </p><p> </p><p>17.  WFP and the DART are concerned about the stability of </p><p>the MOT.  The MOT has made several personnel changes during </p><p>the past week, including the removal of the MOT manager. WFP </p><p>and the DART met with the present, acting manager and are </p><p>hopeful that he will win the confidence of MOT and will be </p><p>selected as the permanent manager within the week. </p><p>Consistent management will be essential during the June </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Due to the recent management changes, the emergency USD </p><p>20 payment to MOT staff has yet to be delivered. According </p><p>to the CMOC, the paperwork is complete and payment will be </p><p>made once the decision of a new manager is made. This should </p><p>be resolved within the next few days. </p><p> </p><p>19.  The CMOC has received several lists from MOT that </p><p>detail looted or needed equipment for the silo, warehouse, </p><p>registration center and grain board.  CMOC has agreed to </p><p>review the lists, conduct CMOC assessments at the MOT </p><p>locations and if viable, submit requests for funding to </p><p>purchase the items and make the repairs.  CMOC is also </p><p>working with the community to retrieve some of the looted </p><p>items. </p><p> </p><p>20.  The DART briefed the CMOC on the need for properly </p><p>trained security officers for the MOT facilities and </p><p>described the CMOC training program in Al Hillah. CMOC </p><p>representatives will work with MOT and CMOC security to </p><p>determine if a similar program could include MOT security </p><p>personnel in Ad Diwaniyah. </p><p> </p><p>21.  The DART and CMOC visited two grain storage sites that </p><p>had been identified as viable wheat supplies for the PDS. </p><p>According to WFP, these sites hold an estimated 60,000 </p><p>metric tons of wheat grain. The quality and age of this </p><p>grain is uncertain, but CMOC agreed to follow-up with MOT to </p><p>inventory the grain and have it tested for suitability for </p><p>human consumption. If the grain is deemed safe for human </p><p>consumption, it could be used for some of the wheat ration </p><p>in June. According to WFP, this is Iraqi wheat purchased by </p><p>the Grain Board. </p><p> </p><p>22.  WFP confirmed the food stock numbers at Ad Diwaniyah </p><p>and determined there would be a shortage of pulses and oil. </p><p>WFP will try and obtain these commodities from surrounding </p><p>governorate overstocks.  The total June distribution cycle </p><p>for Qadissiyah is 15 days. </p><p> </p><p>23.  WFP will work with several feeding programs to provide </p><p>food for the orphanage, an elderly home, a mentally disabled </p><p>home and several hospitals.  The total rations for these </p><p>feedings will be 864. </p><p> </p><p>24.  WFP stated that the MOT understands that some people </p><p>were punished by having their names stricken from the PDS </p><p>roles.  The MOT plans to re-register these people so that </p><p>they can receive PDS rations in June.  The MOT will also </p><p>ensure that those who have lost their ration cards or had </p><p>them confiscated for reasons of punishment will be included </p><p>in the June ration. </p><p> </p><p>25.  WFP staff conducted a taste test on the navy white bean </p><p>provided for distribution. The results of this test was </p><p>"Good smell and tasty." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
