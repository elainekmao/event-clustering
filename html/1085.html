SUMMARY: IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE VIETNAM WAR, </p><p>VIETNAMESE SOCIETY SHUNNED AMERASIANS AND CONSIGNED MANY </p><p>OF THEM TO LIVE ON THE STREETS IN ABJECT POVERTY. OVER THE </p><p>PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, HOWEVER, THEIR SITUATION SEEMS TO </p><p>HAVE IMPROVED. RECENT INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT MOST </p><p>VIETNAMESE NOW TREAT AMERASIANS NO DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00838  01 OF 03  170856Z </p><p>VIETNAMESE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>"CON LAI MY" </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  AMERASIANS IN VIETNAM ARE KNOWN AS "CON LAI MY," WHICH </p><p>ROUGHLY TRANSLATES TO "MIXED-BLOOD AMERICAN."  IN THE WAKE </p><p>OF THE AMERICAN WITHDRAWAL FROM VIETNAM, AMERASIANS AND </p><p>THEIR MOTHERS BECAME THE TARGET OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, </p><p>AND SOCIAL DISCRIMINATION.  MANY VIETNAMESE OSTRACIZED </p><p>THEM FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT FORCIBLY RELOCATED MANY OF THEM, ALONG WITH </p><p>THEIR MOTHERS, TO "NEW ECONOMIC ZONES" WHERE THEY LIVED </p><p>UNDER CONDITIONS OF SEVERE HARDSHIP.  THE GOVERNMENT ALSO </p><p>DENIED MANY AMERASIANS ACCESS TO IDENTITY PAPERS AND OTHER </p><p>DOCUMENTS CRITICAL FOR INTEGRATION INTO CIVIL SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE U.S. CONGRESS RECOGNIZED THE DIRE PLIGHT OF </p><p>AMERASIANS WHEN IT PASSED THE AMERASIAN HOMECOMING ACT IN </p><p>1987.  AS REPORTED IN THE ACT\'S LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, MANY </p><p>"AMERASIAN CHILDREN ARE REPORTEDLY INELIGIBLE FOR RATION </p><p>CARDS AND OFTEN BEG IN THE STREETS, PEDDLE BLACK MARKET </p><p>WARES, OR PROSTITUTE THEMSELVES."  THE HISTORY ALSO NOTES </p><p>THAT "THE MOTHERS OF AMERASIAN CHILDREN IN VIETNAM ARE NOT </p><p>ELIGIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT JOBS OR EMPLOYMENT IN GOVERNMENT </p><p>ENTERPRISES AND MANY ARE ESTRANGED FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND </p><p>ARE DESTITUTE."  THE ACT ALLOWS AMERASIANS (DEFINED AS "AN </p><p>ALIEN WHO WAS BORN IN VIETNAM AFTER JANUARY 1, 1962 AND </p><p>BEFORE JANUARY 1, 1976 AND WHO WAS FATHERED BY A CITIZEN </p><p>OF THE UNITED STATES") AND THEIR CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS TO </p><p>ENTER THE UNITED STATES AS IMMIGRANTS AND RECEIVE REFUGEE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00838  01 OF 03  170856Z </p><p>BENEFITS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TODAY, AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF AMERASIANS STILL LIVE IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  APPROXIMATELY TWENTY AMERASIANS EACH WEEK APPLY </p><p>TO THE REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT SECTION FOR ADMISSION TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES THROUGH THE AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  TO BETTER </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE LIVES OF AMERASIANS TODAY, POST\'S DEPUTY </p><p>RESETTLEMENT SECTION CHIEF (REFOFF) EXAMINED THE </p><p>APPLICATION FORMS OF RECENTLY-APPROVED AMERASIANS, </p><p>SOLICITED INFORMATION THROUGH SURVEYS, AND INTERVIEWED </p><p>PENDING AND PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS. </p><p> </p><p>AMERASIANS APPROVED BETWEEN JANUARY AND MARCH 2000 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE SIXTY-ONE AMERASIANS APPROVED </p><p>FOR ADMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES FROM JANUARY THROUGH </p><p>MARCH 2000 WAS TWENTY-NINE.  FORTY-ONE WERE MARRIED, ONE </p><p>WAS DIVORCED, ONE WAS SEPARATED AND THE REMAINING EIGHTEEN </p><p>WERE SINGLE.  THIRTY-FOUR OF THE SIXTY-ONE AMERASIANS HAD </p><p>AT LEAST ONE CHILD.  NEARLY ALL APPLIED AS MEMBERS OF </p><p>FAMILY GROUPS.  INDEED, ONLY FOUR INTENDED TO GO TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE INTERVIEWED AMERASIANS REPORTED A NINETY-SEVEN </p><p>PERCENT EMPLOYMENT RATE.  THEY ARE EMPLOYED AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>                    LABORER             13 </p><p>                    FARMER                    7 </p><p>                    TAILOR               7 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00838  01 OF 03  170856Z </p><p>                    VENDOR               7 </p><p>                    HOUSEWIFE            5 </p><p>                    BLACKSMITH                     4 </p><p>                    DRIVER               3 </p><p>                    CARPENTER            2 </p><p>                    MECHANIC             2 </p><p>                    FISHERMAN            1 </p><p>                    BAKER                1 </p><p>                    LOTTERY              1 </p><p>                    CYCLO DRIVER         1 </p><p>                    HAIR DRESSER         1 </p><p>                    LOGGER               1 </p><p>                    BRICKLAYER                     1 </p><p>                    PHOTOGRAPHER         1 </p><p> </p><p>ONLY TWO AMERASIANS REPORTED THAT THEY WERE UNEMPLOYED. </p><p> </p><p>MOST AMERASIANS REPORT EQUAL TREATMENT </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THIRTY-SIX OF THE SIXTY-ONE AMERASIANS SURVEYED </p><p>REPORTED THAT, IN THE PAST TEN YEARS, THEY HAD BEEN </p><p>TREATED NO DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER VIETNAMESE. PHUONG THAO, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, IS AN AMERASIAN WHO LIVES IN HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>WITH HER HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER.  SHE HAS NOT YET APPLIED </p><p>FOR THE AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  ALTHOUGH HER MOTHER URGED HER </p><p>TO APPLY FOR AN AMERASIAN VISA IN THE EARLY 1990S, PHUONG </p><p>THAO CHOSE TO STAY IN VIETNAM BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WANT TO </p><p>LEAVE HER EXTENDED FAMILY AND FRIENDS.  SHE NOW MAKES A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00838  02 OF 03  170857Z </p><p>LIVING AS A SINGER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN AN EXTENDED INTERVIEW WITH REFOFF, PHUONG THAO </p><p>RECALLED THAT WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG, OTHER CHILDREN TAUNTED </p><p>HER BECAUSE HER FATHER WAS AMERICAN.  FURTHER, THE </p><p>COMMUNIST YOUTH ORGANIZATION, DOAN THANH VIEN, DID NOT </p><p>ALLOW PHUONG THAO TO JOIN.  PHUONG THAO BELIEVES THAT THIS </p><p>EXCLUSION DISADVANTAGED HER WHEN APPLYING FOR SCHOOLS AND </p><p>EMPLOYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. FOR PHUONG THAO, THE NAME-CALLING AND DISCRIMINATION </p><p>ARE ONLY BAD MEMORIES FROM THE PAST.  NOW, SHE SAYS, THE </p><p>ETHNIC VIETNAMESE TREAT HER JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. NOT </p><p>EVEN THE COMMUNIST PARTY IS OFF LIMITS TO HER.  IF SHE </p><p>WANTED TO JOIN, SHE SAID, SHE COULD.  SOCIALLY, SHE IS </p><p>TREATED AS IF SHE WERE FULLY VIETNAMESE.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>WHEN PHUONG THAO MARRIED IN 1993, HER HUSBAND\'S ETHNIC </p><p>VIETNAMESE PARENTS EASILY ACCEPTED HER INTO THE FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  PHUONG THAO AND HER HUSBAND ARE NOW CONSIDERING </p><p>APPLYING FOR ADMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES THROUGH THE </p><p>AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  THEIR INTENTION IS TO STUDY AND </p><p>PERFORM MUSIC IN THE UNITED STATES FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR AND </p><p>THEN RETURN TO VIETNAM.  SHE AND HER COMPOSER HUSBAND WANT </p><p>TO SHOW THROUGH THEIR SONGS THAT THERE EXIST AMERASIANS </p><p>"WITH AMBITION AND GOOD JOBS, THAT WE\'RE THE SAME AS </p><p>OTHERS." </p><p> </p><p>11.  HONG, ANOTHER AMERASIAN, SHARED MANY OF PHUONG THAO\'S </p><p>EXPERIENCES.  REFOFF VISITED HONG AT HER HOME NEAR QUI </p><p>NHON CITY. BY THE TIME REFOFF FOUND HONG\'S HOUSE LOCATED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00838  02 OF 03  170857Z </p><p>AT THE EDGE OF A COMMUNITY ON THE FAR SIDE OF QUI NHON </p><p>BAY, A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY-FIVE PERSONS HAD </p><p>FORMED AROUND HONG\'S SMALL CEMENT DWELLING.  VILLAGERS </p><p>CROWDED THE DOOR AND PRESSED AGAINST THE WINDOW\'S IRON </p><p>GRILLWORK TO LISTEN AS REFOFF INTERVIEWED HONG IN THE </p><p>FRONT ROOM OF THE HOUSE.  HONG EXPLAINED THAT HER AMERICAN </p><p>FATHER ABANDONED HER MOTHER WHO THEN ABANDONED HONG TO A </p><p>FOSTER FAMILY IN QUI NHON.  SHE HAS NEVER MET OR HEARD </p><p>FROM HER FATHER.  SHE MET HER MOTHER ONCE IN 1986 WHEN SHE </p><p>RESURFACED TO CONVINCE HONG TO TAKE HER TO THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  HONG REFUSED TO GO, CHOOSING INSTEAD TO REMAIN </p><p>WITH HER FOSTER FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>12. IN 1995, HONG FINALLY DECIDED TO APPLY FOR THE </p><p>AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  HOWEVER, THE ORDERLY DEPARTURE PROGRAM </p><p>(ODP) REJECTED HER APPLICATION.  ACCORDING TO THE CASE </p><p>FILE, THE ODP OFFICER DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HONG HAD A </p><p>CREDIBLE AMERASIAN APPEARANCE.  [COMMENT:  REFOFF IS </p><p>CONVINCED THAT HONG IS AMERASIAN.  NOT ONLY DOES HER </p><p>ENTIRE COMMUNITY CONSIDER HER TO BE AMERASIAN, BUT BOTH </p><p>SHE AND HER SON HAVE DISTINCTLY CAUCASIAN FACIAL FEATURES. </p><p>ACCORDINGLY, REFOFF ENCOURAGED HONG TO REAPPLY FOR THE </p><p>AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  END COMMENT.] </p><p> </p><p>13.  HONG SAID THAT HER LIFE HAS BEEN DIFFICULT, BUT SHE </p><p>DOES NOT NECESSARILY ATTRIBUTE HER DIFFICULTIES TO HER </p><p>AMERASIAN HERITAGE.  AS A CHILD, SHE WAS CALLED NAMES SUCH </p><p>AS "CON LAI."  SHE SAID THAT IT SOMETIMES MADE HER SAD TO </p><p>BE REMINDED OF HER LOST PARENTS.  CURRENTLY, HONG INSISTS </p><p>THAT SHE IS TREATED FAIRLY AND WITHOUT REGARD TO BEING </p><p>AMERASIAN.  SHE OWNS A SMALL BOAT AND FERRIES PEOPLE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00838  02 OF 03  170857Z </p><p>ACROSS QUI NHON BAY.  HER HUSBAND IS A FISHERMAN.  SHE </p><p>SAID THAT HER LIFE IS HARD, BUT NO HARDER THAN ANYONE </p><p>ELSE\'S. </p><p> </p><p>14.  TOWARD THE END OF THE INTERVIEW, LIGHT FLOODED THE </p><p>SMALL ROOM AS THE VILLAGERS SUDDENLY PULLED AWAY FROM THE </p><p>WINDOWS AND DISPERSED. A POLICE OFFICER AND A PLAIN- </p><p>CLOTHED GENTLEMAN -- LATER IDENTIFIED AS THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY BLOCK WARDEN -- MARCHED INTO THE SMALL ROOM.  THE </p><p>MEN DEMANDED THAT REFOFF IDENTIFY HIMSELF AND PRODUCE A </p><p>LETTER OF INVITATION.  HAVING NO LETTER, REFOFF EXPLAINED </p><p>THE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT AND INVITED THE TWO OFFICIALS TO </p><p>JOIN IN THE DISCUSSION.  THOUGH AT FIRST RETICENT, BOTH </p><p>THE OFFICER AND THE WARDEN ECHOED WHAT HONG HAD ALREADY </p><p>TOLD REFOFF.  THEY CONFIRMED THAT HONG, THE ONLY AMERASIAN </p><p>IN THE TOWN, IS TREATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HER </p><p>NEIGHBORS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. </p><p> </p><p>SOME CONTINUING INSTANCES OF MISTREATMENT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  OF THOSE AMERASIANS WHO REPORTED DIFFERING TREATMENT, </p><p>THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINT WAS NAME-CALLING.  FOURTEEN OF </p><p>THE AMERASIANS REPORTED BEING CALLED "CON LAI" OR "MY </p><p>LAI," VIETNAMESE FOR MIXED AMERICAN, OR "MY DEN," </p><p>VIETNAMESE FOR BLACK AMERICAN.  THE AMERASIANS REACTED </p><p>DIFFERENTLY TO THE NAME-CALLING.  SOME, LIKE HONG, </p><p>REPORTED FEELINGS OF SHAME OR EMBARRASMENT. OTHERS </p><p>PERCEIVED "CON LAI" AS A TERM OF ENDEARMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00838  03 OF 03  170857Z </p><p>16.  THE NEXT MOST COMMON CONCERN OF THE AMERASIANS WAS </p><p>JOB DISCRIMINATION, WHICH WAS REPORTED BY TEN SURVEY </p><p>RESPONDENTS.  OF THESE, A FEW SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT </p><p>HIRED FOR AT LEAST ONE JOB BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR </p><p>SKIN.  SOME REASONED THAT THEY HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING WORK </p><p>BECAUSE THEY HAD LIMITED EDUCATIONS.  ONE, A THIRTY-TWO- </p><p>YEAR-OLD LABORER FROM BIEN HOA, SAID THAT EMPLOYERS IN HIS </p><p>AREA KNOW AND ACCEPT HIM, BUT WILL NOT HIRE HIM </p><p>PERMANENTLY BECAUSE THEY ASSUME THAT ONE DAY HE WILL </p><p>DECIDE TO LEAVE FOR THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>17.  A FEW SURVEY RESONDENTS REPORTED PROBLEMS.  THREE </p><p>COMPLAINED OF "LACK OF RESPECT," TWO CITED CONTINUING </p><p>EFFECTS OF POOR EDUCATION, ONE CLAIMED TO BE THE VICTIM OF </p><p>ARBITRARY ARREST AND ONE SAID SHE COULD NOT JOIN SOCIAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>18.  THE INFORMATION REPORTED ABOVE, THOUGH BASED ON A </p><p>LIMITED SAMPLE OF AMERASIANS, SUGGESTS THAT THE FORTUNES </p><p>OF AMERASIANS MAY BE CHANGING FOR THE BETTER.  WHEN THE </p><p>AMERASIAN HOMECOMING ACT WAS PASSED THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, </p><p>AMERASIANS WERE THE VICTIMS OF OFFICIAL DISCRIMINATION AND </p><p>WERE COMPELLED TO "BEG IN THE STREETS, PEDDLE BLACK MARKET </p><p>WARES, OR PROSTITUTE THEMSELVES." BASED ON INFORMATION </p><p>COLLECTED BY REFOFF, THIS PORTRAYAL MAY NOW BE FAR FROM </p><p>THE TRUTH. </p><p> </p><p>19.  IN FACT, REFOFF DID NOT FIND A SINGLE AMERASIAN THAT </p><p>WAS BEGGING IN THE STREETS, PEDDLING BLACK MARKET WARES, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00838  03 OF 03  170857Z </p><p>OR PROSTITUTING HIM OR HERSELF.  NEARLY ALL THE AMERASIANS </p><p>IN THE SUBJECT GROUP WERE MEMBERS OF LONG-STANDING FAMILY </p><p>UNITS AND EMPLOYED IN LEGITIMATE JOBS OR PROFESSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>20.  AT THE TIME THE ACT WAS PASSED, AMERASIANS ALSO </p><p>REPORTEDLY SUFFERED DISCRIMINATION IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>RATION CARDS AND IN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT.  THESE ISSUES </p><p>ARE NO LONGER RELEVANT.  THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT NO </p><p>LONGER DISTRIBUTES RATION CARDS, AND GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT </p><p>IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO MAKE A LIVING IN VIETNAM. </p><p>FURTHER, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY ENGAGES IN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION </p><p>AGAINST AMERASIANS. </p><p> </p><p>21.  THE INFORMATION REPORTED ABOVE SUGGESTS THAT </p><p>AMERASIANS, NOW ALL ADULTS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 24 AND 38, </p><p>HAVE GENERALLY ENJOYED A POSITIVE SHIFT IN SOCIAL STATUS </p><p>SINCE THE END OF THE VIETNAM WAR. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>SOME AMERASIANS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MISTREATMENT.  SOME </p><p>MISTREATMENT IS, NO DOUBT, DUE IN PART TO A CULTURAL </p><p>AVERSION TO MIXED-BLOOD CHILDREN, COMMON IN MANY PARTS OF </p><p>ASIA.  IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT MANY AMERASIANS EXPERIENCE </p><p>EMPLOYMENT DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE THEY LACKED EDUCATIONAL </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES AS CHILDREN.  MOST AMERASIANS IN REFOFF\'S </p><p>SAMPLE, HOWEVER, APPEAR TO LEAD LIVES INDISTINGUISHABLE </p><p>FROM OTHER VIETNAMESE. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
