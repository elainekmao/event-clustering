<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, NEA/NGA AND PM; DOD FOR OSD AND ISP; NSC </p><p>FOR BRYZA. EUCOM FOR J3, J4 AND J5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH CABINENT APPROVES USE OF BASES AND PORTS </p><p>FOR OPERATIONS CONSISTENT WITH UNSCR 1483; EUCOM REQUEST TO </p><p>STATION TANKERS AT INCIRLIK ALSO APPROVED </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA DDG for the Americas Suna Ilicak told the DCM June </p><p>25 that the Turkish cabinet earlier this week had approved </p><p>the use of Turkish bases and ports for humanitarian and </p><p>reconstruction operations covered under UNSCR 1483.  Ilicak </p><p>said the Cabinet\'s decision came in the form of a decree, is </p><p>now in effect, and does not require Parliamentary approval or </p><p>an MOU.  The decree applied to all allies and friendly </p><p>nations.  In terms of procedures, Ilicak said if the US </p><p>wanted to use a specific base or port, the Embassy should </p><p>follow "normal" procedures and submit a diplomatic note to </p><p>the MFA, who would then coordinate a response with the </p><p>Turkish General Staff (TGS).  Pol-Mil officer sought </p><p>clarification, noting that the US previously had conveyed </p><p>requests for the use of Turkish bases/ports through military </p><p>channels (i.e. a letter from the Office of Defense </p><p>Cooperation to TGS), with the Embassy back-briefing the MFA. </p><p>He reminded Ilicak that EUCOM\'s recent request to station 10 </p><p>tankers and one ISR aircraft at Incirlik to support OEF and </p><p>OIF missions was conveyed through military channels.  Ilicak </p><p>said the MFA would confer with the TGS and get back to us on </p><p>whether the US should convey future requests via civilian </p><p>(i.e. the MFA) or military (i.e. TGS) channels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The DCM asked if the Cabinet\'s decision covered </p><p>EUCOM\'s request.  Ilicak said that in her view the answer was </p><p>"yes."  However, TGS would have to make the final decision. </p><p>Citing another hypothetical example, the DCM asked if the </p><p>Cabinet\'s decree would apply to a request for US aircraft </p><p>transporting goods and supplies to OCPA to stop at Incirlik </p><p>and then proceed to Iraq.  Ilicak said she believed the </p><p>decree covered such an example. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Later the same day, a TGS/J3 officer telephoned ODC to </p><p>inform that, consistent with the Cabinet\'s decree, TGS had </p><p>verbally approved EUCOM\'s request.  The TGS officer said the </p><p>formal approval in writing would be forthcoming.  ODC intends </p><p>to follow up with TGS in person June 26 to obtain more </p><p>details. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
