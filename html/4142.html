<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 002046 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS, CA/OCS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, ASEC, CASC, CE, MIssion Security </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka:  Muslim-Sinhalese riot in Colombo </p><p>leaves one dead; tensions continue to smolder </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- </p><p>Please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On the afternoon of October 30, a riot erupted </p><p>in Maligawatte, a northern suburb of Colombo, between </p><p>Sinhalese and Muslim residents.  The initial dispute </p><p>reportedly began when Sinhalese locals protested against </p><p>the start of construction of what was apparently a </p><p>mosque.  One person died during the riot, reportedly </p><p>from a rubber bullet fired by the police, and </p><p>approximately 20 others were injured.  A number of </p><p>vehicles and buildings (included the home of one FSN) </p><p>were reported burnt down.  The police imposed a curfew, </p><p>and the military assisted in enforcing it, from 4pm </p><p>October 30, until 6am the following morning.  As of late </p><p>afternoon October 31, confrontations between the two </p><p>communities continued; the police have imposed another </p><p>curfew.  The clash between the Muslims and Sinhalese </p><p>does not appear linked to the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) One American citizen (Amcit), a Mission Warden, </p><p>residing in Maligawatte phoned Conoff on the afternoon </p><p>of October 30 advising him that rioting was taking place </p><p>outside his home and that rioters were breaking into </p><p>surrounding houses.  Conoff kept the Amcit on the line, </p><p>calming him, while the RSO coordinated with local police </p><p>to ensure protection of the property.  The police </p><p>guarded the house for the remainder of the night and </p><p>withdrew the next morning.  There was no reported damage </p><p>to the Amcit\'s residence after the police arrived; </p><p>windows were broken earlier in the day. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Mission sent the following message to the </p><p>American Community through the Warden Network on October </p><p>30: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>Riots broke out today between Muslim and Sinhalese </p><p>faction in the Maligawatte section of greater Colombo. </p><p>There have also been clashes reported in the Borella </p><p>section.  Police have rerouted traffic northbound out of </p><p>Colombo, toward the airport, through Kaduwela and across </p><p>the Kaduwela Bridge, about 15 miles southeast of </p><p>Colombo.  Traffic through this area is very heavy. </p><p>Police have announced a curfew in those areas and the </p><p>surrounding areas.  The army has deployed to restore </p><p>order in the Maligawatte area.  Spontaneous riots could </p><p>start in other areas. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy urges all Americans in Sri Lanka to abide by </p><p>any local curfew.  Because violence might erupt quickly, </p><p>we urge you to be especially aware of what is going on </p><p>around you.  If violence erupts in your area, you should </p><p>remain in your homes, if possible.  Please feel free to </p><p>contact the Embassy (448-601) if you see violence erupt </p><p>in your area.  The Embassy will send other messages as </p><p>the situation develops. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
