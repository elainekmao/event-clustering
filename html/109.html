<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 029781 </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING STATE 029781 DTD JAN 30, 1986 SENT ACTION </p><p>ALL AFRICAN DIPLOMATIC POSTS, INFO LONDON, PARIS, </p><p>BRUSSELS, BONN, TOKYO, SEOUL, CAIRO, SECDEF, DIA, </p><p>CENTCOM MACDILL AFB, USEUCOM VAIHINGEN, JSOC FT BRAGG, </p><p>BEING REPEATED FOR YOUR INFO: </p><p> </p><p>QUOTE: </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 029781 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, UG </p><p>SUBJECT: DEVELOPMENTS IN UGANDA </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOLLOWING FOR POST\'S INFORMATION IS TEXT OF </p><p>INFORMATION MEMO DATED 1/28/86 ON DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>UGANDA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BEGIN TEXT.  SUMMARY:  SOUTHERN GUERRILLAS HAVE WON </p><p>THE CAPITAL AND HEARTLAND OF UGANDA AND HAVE THE </p><p>MILITARY EDGE ON DISSIDENT NORTHERN TRIBES. THE NEW </p><p>HEAD OF STATE IS A FERVENT NATIONALIST WHO LIKELY WILL </p><p>COMBINE THIRD-WORLD RHETORIC WITH PRAGMATIC POLICIES. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE 5,000-MAN NATIONAL RESISTANCE ARMY (NRA) NOW </p><p>CONTROLS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF UGANDA AND GAINS GROUND </p><p>DAILY FROM FORMER GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN DISORDERLY </p><p>RETREAT.  LONGER TERM, NRA FORCES LIKELY WILL FACE </p><p> </p><p>LOW-GRADE BUSH WARFARE FROM DISSIDENT NORTHERN TRIBES. </p><p>NRA\'S SUPERIOR DISCIPLINE AND ORGANIZATION, AND ITS </p><p>CONTROL OVER THE CAPITAL AND ECONOMIC HEART OF UGANDA, </p><p>SHOULD GIVE IT A DECISIVE EDGE.  NRA ESCHEWS THE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ABUSES OF FORMER MILITARY LEADERS AND HAS BEEN </p><p>MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THEY IN WINNING THE POPULATION\'S </p><p>AFFECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ALL 170 AMERICANS IN UGANDA ARE REPORTED SAFE AND </p><p>KAMPALA IS RETURNING TO NORMAL WITH RESTORATION OF </p><p>POWER, WATER AND TELEPHONE, AND REOPENING OF MARKETS. </p><p>IN CONTRAST TO THE BEHAVIOR OF GOVERNMENT TROOPS AFTER </p><p>THE JULY 85 COUP, NRA SOLDIERS ARE REPORTED TO BE </p><p>WELLDISCIPLINED AND POPULAR WITH TOWNSPEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR HOUDEK HAS MET WITH NRA COMMANDER YOWERI </p><p>MUSEVENI AND FEELS WE CAN WORK WITH THE NEW REGIME. </p><p>MUSEVENI MAY BE A STRIDENT INTERLOCUTOR, BUT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE INIMICAL TO U.S. INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>MUSEVENI\'S IDEOLOGICAL ORIENTATION IS MURKY, COMBINING </p><p>FERVENT NATIONALISM, THIRD WORLD RHETORIC AND PRAGMATIC </p><p>OPPORTUNISM.  HE DECLARED TO THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY </p><p>THAT HIS FOREIGN POLICY WOULD BE NON-ALIGNED AND THAT </p><p>HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SOUTH AFRICA AND </p><p>ISRAEL.  LIKE MANY UGANDAN FACTIONS, HE HAS SOUGHT </p><p>LIBYAN ASSISTANCE, BUT WAS MOTIVATED PROBABLY MORE BY </p><p>OPPORTUNISM THAN IDEOLOGICAL AFFILIATION.  NRA </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES HAVE STRESSED TO US THEIR DESIRE FOR </p><p>GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>IN HIS WRITINGS, MUSEVENI HAS FAVORED ACTIVE STATE </p><p>GUIDANCE OVER THE ECONOMY.  BUT HE HAS ALSO RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT FREE ENTERPRISE BASED ON SMALLHOLDER AGRICULTURE </p><p>IS THE KEY TO UGANDA\'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  MUSEVENI </p><p>SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WILL WELCOME FOREIGN ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>DEVELOPING PRODUCTIVE ENTERPRISES.  OUR AMBASSADOR IS </p><p>ANXIOUS TO RESUME THE AID PROGRAM AND ENGAGE MUSEVENI </p><p>IN DIALOGUE ON UGANDA\'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>EVOLUTION. END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  KAMPALA MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p>UNQUOTE </p><p> </p><p>SHULTZ </p><p></p></div>
