<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/ACE, EUR/SCE, INL/AAG </p><p>STATE PASS TO USAID, E&E/ADAA FOR PAULA FEENEY AND TO </p><p>E&E/ECA FOR ANNE CONVERY </p><p>DEPT OF JUSTICE FOR ICITAP/OPDAT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, PHUM, KCOR, KJUS, EAID, PHUM, KCOR, KJUS, HR, HRPGOV, IBRD, EVN </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL DONORS REACH AGREEMENT WITH GOC </p><p>ON COURT REFORM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00517  01 OF 02  101514Z </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 465 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DONORS AND THE GOC </p><p>HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT ON A STANDARDIZED COURT AND CASE </p><p>MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE PLATFORM THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN </p><p>COURTS COUNTRY-WIDE. THIS NEW SYSTEM WILL IMPROVE MUCH- </p><p>NEEDED JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE GOC </p><p>COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY SEPARATE DONOR </p><p>INITIATIVES. THE AGREEMENT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE HIGH </p><p>DEGREE OF COORDINATION AMONG THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>DONORS IN CROATIA.  UNDER THE AGREEMENT, USAID WILL </p><p>MERGE THE DESIGN WORK ALREADY COMPLETED UNDER TWO </p><p>SEPARATE PROJECTS INTO A UNIFIED SYSTEM.  SUBSEQUENTLY, </p><p>THE WORLD BANK AND THE EU WILL ROLL OUT THE NEW </p><p>TECHNOLOGY.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. THE NOTORIOUSLY INEFFICIENT CROATIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM </p><p>IS ONE OF THE MAJOR DISINCENTIVES TO INVESTMENT, AND </p><p>LAGGING REFORM IN THE SECTOR IS SEEN AS A SERIOUS </p><p>ROADBLOCK TOWARDS EVENTUAL EU ACCESSION.  SEVERAL DONOR </p><p>PROGRAMS ARE WORKING ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM </p><p>WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS.  A MINISTRY OF JUSTICE </p><p>IN DISARRAY AND WITH LITTLE COMMITMENT TO REFORM TAKES </p><p>NO LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE REFORM PROCESS, AND IN MANY </p><p>CASES SEEMS TO BE WORKING AGAINST IT. </p><p> </p><p>3. MULTI-YEAR CASE BACKLOGS ARE COMMON IN COURTS </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGE </p><p>URBAN COURTS OF ZAGREB, SPLIT, AND RIJEKA.  THE PROBLEM </p><p>IS BOTH LACK OF AUTOMATION (RECORDS OF CASE FILINGS ARE </p><p>KEPT IN MULTIPLE LARGE HANDWRITTEN REGISTRY BOOKS), AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00517  01 OF 02  101514Z </p><p>PROCEDURAL RULES THAT ALLOW FOR ENDLESS DELAYS BY THE </p><p>PARTIES.  THE GOAL OF A USAID PROGRAM BEGUN IN 2001 WAS </p><p>TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A NEW, MODERN COURT AND CASE </p><p>MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SYSTEM IN THE MUNICIPAL COURTS OF </p><p>ZAGREB, THE LARGEST GENERAL JURISDICTION COURT SYSTEM IN </p><p>EUROPE.  THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDED THE PROCUREMENT OF </p><p>NEW HARDWARE AS WELL AS RELATED TRAINING FOR JUDGES AND </p><p>COURT PERSONNEL. </p><p> </p><p>4. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, A PARALLEL USAID PROJECT WAS </p><p>BEGUN TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A NEW SOFTWARE SYSTEM IN </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL COURTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  THE USAID </p><p>PROJECT IN THE COMMERCIAL COURTS WAS DESIGNED TO WORK IN </p><p>CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH A WORLD BANK PROJECT FOCUSING </p><p>ON REFORM OF THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IN CROATIA.  THE </p><p>AGREEMENT WAS THAT USAID WOULD FORM AND LEAD A WORKING </p><p>GROUP OF COMMERCIAL COURT JUDGES TO PERFORM THE </p><p>NECESSARY STUDY OF ALL THE PROCEDURAL RULES OF THE </p><p>COURTS IN ORDER TO DESIGN THE SOFTWARE.  ONCE THE </p><p>SOFTWARE SPECIFICATIONS WERE COMPLETED, THE $5 MILLION </p><p>WORLD BANK PROJECT WOULD THEN PAY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>THE SOFTWARE AS WELL AS NEW IT HARDWARE FOR THE MAJORITY </p><p>OF THE COMMERCIAL COURTS ACROSS CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>5. AT THE TIME THESE DONOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BEGAN, </p><p>CROATIAN LEGAL EXPERTS AND THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE WERE </p><p>ADAMANT THAT THE PROCEDURAL RULES UNDER WHICH THE </p><p>MUNICIPAL AND COMMERCIAL COURTS OPERATED WERE SO </p><p>DIFFERENT THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE ONE COMMON </p><p>COURT AND CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  BUT AS THE USAID AND </p><p>WORLD BANK ADVISORS LED WORKING GROUPS OF MUNICIPAL AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00517  01 OF 02  101514Z </p><p>COMMERCIAL COURT JUDGES IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE RULES AND </p><p>PROCEDURES OF THE COURTS, IT BECAME INCREASINGLY CLEAR </p><p>THAT THERE WAS MORE COMMONALITY THAN DIFFERENCES IN </p><p>THEIR OPERATIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE COST AND EFFICIENCY </p><p>ADVANTAGES OF ONE COMMON COURT AND CASE MANAGEMENT </p><p>SYSTEM FOR VIRTUALLY ALL THE COURTS IN CROATIA WERE </p><p>CLEAR, AND FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING SUCH A SYSTEM WAS </p><p>BECOMING MORE OBVIOUS, THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE CONTINUED </p><p>TO INSIST ON SEPARATE SYSTEMS. </p><p> </p><p>6. A RECENT VISIT BY THE WORLD BANK TEAM MANAGING THE </p><p>BANKRUPTCY PROJECT TRIGGERED THE FORMATION OF A UNITED </p><p>DONOR POSITION ON THE ISSUE.  THE GROUP\'S HAND WAS </p><p>STRENGTHENED BY THE EU\'S INTEREST IN INVESTING $7.5 </p><p>MILLION IN CARDS FUNDING IN COURT REFORM.  THE EU HAD </p><p>BEEN TRYING WITH LITTLE SUCCESS TO ENGAGE THE MINISTRY </p><p>IN DEVELOPING CONCRETE PLANS FOR THE FUNDS AND, WHEN </p><p>APPROACHED, EU/CARDS STAFF WAS EAGER TO ADD THEIR </p><p>LEVERAGE TO THE USAID AND WORLD BANK EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>7. THE DONORS THEN PRESENTED THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8308 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00517  02 OF 02  101514Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EUR-00   UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   M-00     NEA-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  PA-00    PER-00   IRM-00   TEST-00  SA-00    DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-01   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /002W </p><p>                  ------------------41D475  101515Z /38 </p><p>R 101502Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9640 </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE </p><p>DEPT OF JUSTICE WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/ACE, EUR/SCE, INL/AAG </p><p>STATE PASS TO USAID, E&E/ADAA FOR PAULA FEENEY AND TO </p><p>E&E/ECA FOR ANNE CONVERY </p><p>DEPT OF JUSTICE FOR ICITAP/OPDAT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, PHUM, KCOR, KJUS, IBRD, EVN, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL DONORS REACH AGREEMENT WITH GOC </p><p>ON COURT REFORM </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00517  02 OF 02  101514Z </p><p>WITH A UNITED POSITION.  ALL OF THE PREPARATORY WORK HAD </p><p>BEEN COMPLETED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO COURT AND CASE </p><p>MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, BUT BASED ON THAT WORK IT </p><p>WAS NOW CLEAR THAT THE TWO SYSTEMS HAD MUCH COMMONALITY. </p><p>THE DONORS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THE SOFTWARE BE </p><p>WRITTEN SO THAT THE BASIC SYSTEM COULD BE USED IN ALL </p><p>COURTS, AND ADDITIONAL MODULES BE WRITTEN TO ACCOMMODATE </p><p>THOSE AREAS OF COURT PROCEDURES (E.G., BANKRUPTCY </p><p>PROCEEDINGS) WHERE PROCESSES DIFFERED.  THE TWO SETS OF </p><p>FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS WRITTEN BY THE USAID </p><p>CONTRACTORS COULD BE RELATIVELY QUICKLY MERGED, THEIR </p><p>AREAS OF COMMONALITY AND DIFFERENCES DEFINED, AND A </p><p>TENDER THEN PREPARED FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.  THE EU </p><p>SWEETENED THE OFFER WITH THE COMMITMENT TO PUT THEIR </p><p>RESOURCES TOWARDS PAYING FOR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL </p><p>HARDWARE TO ROLL THE SYSTEM OUT COUNTRY WIDE.  FACED </p><p>WITH THE UNITED DONORS AND THE COMPELLING LOGIC OF THE </p><p>PROPOSAL, THE MOJ AGREED. </p><p> </p><p>8. THE DONORS AND THE MINISTRY ARE IN DISCUSSIONS OVER </p><p>THE FINAL DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT, BUT USAID HAS </p><p>COMMITTED TO LEAD THE PROCESS OF MERGING THE TWO SETS OF </p><p>SOFTWARE FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS.  THIS WILL TAKE </p><p>SEVERAL MONTHS, AT WHICH POINT USAID WILL HAND OFF THE </p><p>FINAL PRODUCT TO THE WORLD BANK TO TENDER FOR THE </p><p>SOFTWARE.  THE WORLD BANK AND THE EU HOPE TO BEGIN THEIR </p><p>RESPECTIVE PROCUREMENT PROCESSES FOR LARGE QUANTITIES OF </p><p>IT HARDWARE IN THE FOLLOWING MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE DECISION TO PROCEED WITH A UNIFIED SYSTEM IS A </p><p>CLEAR WIN/WIN SITUATION.  THE CROATIAN COURTS GET A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00517  02 OF 02  101514Z </p><p>SINGLE COURT AND CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS AMONG ALL THE COURTS AND INVOLVE LOWER </p><p>MAINTENANCE COSTS.  THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AVOIDS </p><p>PAYING FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT SOFTWARE </p><p>SYSTEM (ESTIMATED COST $800,000) AND WILL USE WORLD BANK </p><p>LOAN FUNDS TO DEVELOP THE UNIFIED SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>10. IN THE PROCESS OF HAMMERING OUT THE DEAL, THE DONOR </p><p>COMMUNITY HAS IMPROVED COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>ON JUSTICE SECTOR REFORM, BOTH AMONG THE DONORS AND </p><p>BETWEEN THE DONORS AND THE MINISTRY.  AND FINALLY, TWO </p><p>RELATIVELY NEW AND REFORM-MINDED ASSISTANT MINISTERS IN </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HAVE NOW BECOME MORE ENGAGED THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROJECTS.  THERE IS STILL A LONG </p><p>JOURNEY AHEAD ON THE ROAD TO THE REFORM OF THE CROATIAN </p><p>JUSTICE SECTOR, BUT THIS AGREEMENT REPRESENTS A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD ON THAT JOURNEY. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
