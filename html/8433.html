The Iraqi MOT called a meeting in Baghdad on 20 May of </p><p>the Governorate MOT directors to discuss preparations for </p><p>the first countrywide public food distribution since the war </p><p>ended, set to begin in June.  Representatives from ORHA, the </p><p>DART, WFP, and Iraqi MOT attended.  MOT officials raised </p><p>several issues that they feel must be resolved immediately, </p><p>and they agreed to work closely together toward the goal of </p><p>resuming the distribution of food rations in June.  In </p><p>Basrah, a 23 May meeting of ORHA\'s "Lower South" PDS working </p><p>group was called to examine the food pipeline, ration </p><p>composition, and progress on re-establishing PDS </p><p>infrastructure.  Issues common to the meetings were security </p><p>concerns, and infrastructure constraints.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>MOT BAGHDAD CALLS MEETING OF ALL GOVERNORATE MOT DIRECTORS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Ministry of Trade (MOT) and the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), summoned </p><p>MOT officials representing each of the eighteen Iraqi </p><p>Governorates to a meeting held at a conference center near </p><p>the former Republican Guard Palace in Baghdad on 20 May. </p><p>Members of the DART and the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) </p><p>also attended.  The ORHA official responsible for the </p><p>Minister of Trade, Ambassador Robin Raphel, chaired the </p><p>discussions, with an interpreter simultaneously translating </p><p>her comments from English into Arabic. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Ambassador Raphel assured the group that she was aware </p><p>of a multitude of problems facing the MOT.  She asked that </p><p>each Governorate assess the status of the MOT buildings, </p><p>furniture, computers and personnel needed to revive the </p><p>public distribution system (PDS).  She said ORHA would </p><p>provide the MOT in each Governorate with USD 50,000 to make </p><p>emergency repairs to warehouses, silos, grain elevators, and </p><p>office buildings to facilitate a resumption of the PDS in </p><p>June. </p><p> </p><p>3.  She also asked each Governorate representative to </p><p>provide the Ministry with a point of contact for the </p><p>program, which will be shared with the Coalition Civil </p><p>Affairs units in each region.  (Note:  As of 27 May, no DART </p><p>or WFP member is aware of the USD 50,000 payments yet being </p><p>provided.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  Ambassador Raphel introduced Yousef Abdel Rahman as the </p><p>Iraqi point of contact in the Ministry in Baghdad, and said </p><p>he will work with officials in each Governorate to compile a </p><p>report describing the status of the grain elevators and </p><p>silos in each area of the country. </p><p> </p><p>5.  PThe articipants repeated several times that the lack of </p><p>security is a primary concern in trying to revive the PDS. </p><p>Ambassador Raphel said there are plans to create a guard </p><p>force to secure the Ministry of Trade warehouses and silos. </p><p>(Comment: This process has begun in all Governorates in the </p><p>south; however, no single consistent approach is being used. </p><p>In some areas, MOT guards are being trained and armed by </p><p>Coalition forces.  In other areas, MOT guards are to be </p><p>drawn from a broader pool of guard trainees -- a subset of </p><p>newly trained police forces.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>LOCAL PURCHASE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  After security, MOT managers\' next greatest concern is </p><p>the question of the purchase of local grain production for </p><p>the National Strategic Reserves (NSR). Traditionally, Iraq\'s </p><p>MOT Grain Boards purchased locally-produced wheat at the end </p><p>of every harvest season.  This year, there has been </p><p>confusion over how much grain would be purchased, where the </p><p>funds would come from, and how a severely damaged Grain </p><p>Board infrastructure could undertake the necessary quality </p><p>control and management of newly purchased stocks. </p><p> </p><p>7.  MOT managers were informed that ORHA, with assistance </p><p>from WFP, would purchase up to 1.2 million tons of grain </p><p>this year, and that an agreement was being developed which </p><p>would set the modalities of the purchase process, including </p><p>the purchase price.  MOT managers stressed the need to act </p><p>quickly, because in many Governorates in the south, local </p><p>produce was already arriving at MOT warehouses and silos. </p><p> </p><p>8.  A related problem facing ORHA and the MOT are the </p><p>reported hundreds of thousands of tons of grain from last </p><p>year\'s crop remaining in the NSR.  Anecdotal reports </p><p>indicate that large quantities of this grain may be </p><p>contaminated with aflotoxin at levels far exceeding those </p><p>acceptable for human or animal consumption.  (Note: </p><p>Aflotoxins are carcinogenic and associated particularly with </p><p>liver cancer in humans.  Aflotoxin contamination is common </p><p>in Iraq, and "acceptable" levels of aflotoxin contamination </p><p>are reported to far exceed international standards. End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  The ORHA/WFP/MOT local purchase agreement does establish </p><p>a mechanism of quality control for this year\'s harvest. </p><p>However, there is no plan in place for the assessment and </p><p>testing of grain currently in the NSR, nor recognition of </p><p>time and resources, which will be required to sample, test, </p><p>transport and destroy large quantities of grain. </p><p>Significant time will also be required for the cleaning of </p><p>silos and warehouses storing contaminated grain. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Ambassador Raphel has said she will determine if Iraq </p><p>has a facility to conduct a proper analysis of the wheat </p><p>before any action is taken to destroy it.  DART and WFP will </p><p>discuss this issue further with the Food and Agricultural </p><p>Organization, and are proposing the immediate collection of </p><p>samples in each Governorate for independent testing in </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>BASRAH LOWER SOUTH WORKING GROUP MEETING </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  At the weekly task force PDS meeting in Basrah on 23 </p><p>May, members of the Coalition military forces, DART, ORHA, </p><p>MOT, and WFP discussed the status of the food commodities in </p><p>the "Lower South" - the four southern Governorates of </p><p>Maysan, Dhi Qar, Muthanna and Basrah.  WFP stated there are </p><p>enough food supplies in the pipeline to begin the PDS on 1 </p><p>June.  However, quantities of powdered whole milk, part of </p><p>the adult PDS ration, are extremely low. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WFP reported that the MOT in Baghdad was in the process </p><p>of establishing a countrywide ration for the month of June, </p><p>which follows the pre-war practice.  Coalition forces </p><p>expressed concern over this prospect, stressing the fact </p><p>that it was in the southern Governorates where distributions </p><p>at the end of March had been disrupted, and in Basrah </p><p>specifically, where the distribution shortfalls have not </p><p>been filled.  (Note:  Setting the ration involves taking </p><p>stock of the tonnage of each PDS commodity and making a </p><p>determination of the quantities of each commodity that each </p><p>person is to receive, if the quantities needed for the </p><p>optimal ration are unavailable.  Transport among </p><p>Governorates is then required to ensure that sufficient </p><p>quantities are present in each Governorate.  Before the war, </p><p>the MOT announced each month the quantities of each </p><p>commodity and the date the distribution would begin.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>13.  Because of these concerns, it was decided that </p><p>Ambassador Ole Olssen, the regional coordinator for ORHA in </p><p>the Lower South, would send a communication to ORHA/Baghdad </p><p>and MOT, outlining the Lower South preparations for the 1 </p><p>June distributions.  These preparations include: a) the </p><p>establishment of a ration consistent with existing and </p><p>expected stocks; b) the transport of commodities between </p><p>governorates to ensure a uniform ration; and c) finalization </p><p>of a distribution timeline by district for each Governorate. </p><p> </p><p>14.  While in Basrah on 27 May, the DART learned from WFP </p><p>that the MOT is due to notify WFP late on 28 May what the </p><p>ration will be for the June distribution. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
