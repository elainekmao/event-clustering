STRIKES AND LABOR DEMONSTRATIONS IN ITALY ARE MOUNTING. </p><p>WORKING HOURS LOST TO STRIKES IN JANUARY-FEBRUARY WERE NEARLY </p><p>1,500 PERCENT HIGHER THAN IN COMPARABLE MONTHS OF 2001. </p><p>TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION CGIL ORGANIZED A RECORD MILLION- </p><p>PLUS ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTEST IN ROME 3/23, FOLLOWED 3/26 BY </p><p>ITALY-WIDE TRADE UNION RALLIES AGAINST TERRORISM.  OVERCOMING </p><p>DIFFERENCES, ALL FOUR NATIONAL TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS ARE </p><p>PLANNING A GENERAL STRIKE 4/16 TO PROTEST PROPOSALS FOR GOI </p><p>LABOR LAW REFORM.  CONFRONTATION SEEMS TO BE IN THE AIR, </p><p>REMINISCENT OF TURMOIL THAT HELPED BRING DOWN THE FIRST </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOI IN 1994.

BUT SIMILARITIES NOTWITHSTANDING, TIMES HAVE CHANGED. </p><p>CURRENT PROBLEMS STEM FROM FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS IN ITALIAN </p><p>SOCIETY.  ITALY\'S WELTER OF SHORT-LIVED, SHIFTING COALITION </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAS ENDED.  A STABLE ALLIANCE THAT HAS EMERGED ON </p><p>THE CENTER-RIGHT IS BENT ON USING ITS PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY </p><p>TO ENACT LONG-DELAYED REFORMS.  "BIPOLARISM" IS INCOMPLETE ON </p><p>THE CENTER-LEFT, HOWEVER, WHERE PREVIOUS POLITICAL ALLIANCES </p><p>ARE DECOMPOSING AND NO COHERENT OPPOSITION CAN CHECK THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.  WITH REGARD AT LEAST TO LABOR LAW </p><p>REFORM, THIS ROLE HAS BEEN TAKEN UP OUTSIDE THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>FORUM BY CIVIL SOCIETY\'S STRONGEST INSTITUTION, THE 5.4 </p><p>MILLION-MEMBER TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION CGIL.

THE EMERGING UNION/GOI CONFRONTATION INVOLVES NO </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY OR PROGRAM. </p><p>EACH SIDE SUPPORTS DEMOCRACY, MAJORITY RULE, HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS.  FOR THE MOMENT, HOWEVER, THE </p><p>CONTENDERS MUST WRESTLE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY\'S SHORTCOMINGS AND THOSE OF ITALIAN </p><p>SOCIETY\'S HIERARCHICAL, NON-EGALITARIAN HERITAGE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY: A RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>4.  ONCE UPON A TIME ITALY WAS GOVERNED BY SHORT-LIVED </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, COMPOSED OF SHIFTING COALITIONS, THAT HAD A </p><p>FACTION-RIDDEN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC (DC) PARTY AT ITS CENTER. </p><p>WITH SOME VARIATION, 52 SUCH EXPERIENCES TOOK PLACE BETWEEN </p><p>THE REPUBLIC\'S PROCLAMATION IN JUNE 1946 AND "BIPOLARISM\'S" </p><p>EMERGENCE IN MAY 1996.  IN SEVERAL CASES, A MINORITY DC </p><p>GOVERNED ALONE, TACITLY SUPPORTED BY ALLIES NOT FORMALLY PART </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT.  ALTHOUGH RESPONDING TO PRAGMATIC AND </p><p>PERSONALITY CONSIDERATIONS, THE PARTIES PRETENDED TO BE </p><p>MOTIVATED BY PARTICULAR IDEOLOGIES - CATHOLICISM, SOCIALISM, </p><p>LIBERALISM.  THE IDEOLOGIES MADE DECISION-MAKING DIFFICULT, </p><p>IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, FOR GOVERNMENTS THAT RISKED BREAKUP OVER </p><p>INTRACTABLE ISSUES.  THE CONTINUOUS FORMATION, BREAKUP, AND </p><p>RECOMPOSING OF GOVERNMENTS LEFT CITIZENS LITTLE OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO CONTROL THE COMPLEXION OR POLICIES OF GOVERNMENT THROUGH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01744  01 OF 05  081356Z </p><p>THEIR EXERCISE OF THE BALLOT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THAT PERIOD HAS ENDED.  IN THE EARLY 1990\'S, THE PARTIES </p><p>THAT HAD FORMED 50 POST-WWII REVOLVING DOOR GOVERNMENTS </p><p>IMPLODED UNDER THE PRESSURE OF JUDICIAL "CLEAN HANDS" </p><p>CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS.  A NEW PARTY (FORZA ITALIA - FI), </p><p>FOUNDED BY BUSINESSMAN SILVIO BERLUSCONI, EMERGED AS THE </p><p>WINNER OF MAY 1994 ELECTIONS.  FI WAS NOMINALLY CENTER-RIGHT </p><p>AND DREW MUCH OF ITS SUPPORT FROM FORMER DC VOTERS.  IT WAS </p><p>NON-IDEOLOGICAL, HOWEVER, PROJECTING ITS FOUNDER\'S IMAGE OF </p><p>MODERNIZING, BUSINESSLIKE PRAGMATISM.  BERLUSCONI FORMED A </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH HELP FROM ANOTHER PRAGMATIST, GIANFRANCO </p><p>FINI, WHO SOUGHT TO RESHAPE FASCISM\'S POST-WWII HEIR (THE </p><p>MSI) INTO A CONSERVATIVE, BUT CONTEMPORARY PARTY (THE </p><p>ALLIANZA NAZIONALE - AN).  STILL SHORT OF A PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>MAJORITY, BERLUSCONI WAS FORCED TO TURN TO THE SOMETIME </p><p>SECESSIONIST NORTHERN LEAGUE (LN), LED BY MAVERICK UMBERTO </p><p>BOSSI.  THE COMBINATION PROVED UNSTABLE, AND BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>FIRST ATTEMPT AT GOVERNING ITALY COLLAPSED SEVEN MONTHS AFTER </p><p>IT WAS FORMED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  LEFT-OF-CENTER PARTIES, LARGELY UNTOUCHED BY THE "CLEAN </p><p>HANDS" INVESTIGATIONS, BENEFITED FROM BERLUSCONI\'S FAILED </p><p>1994 VENTURE.  ROMANO PRODI FORMED A GOVERNMENT IN MAY 1996 </p><p>THAT UNITED UNDER ONE UMBRELLA ALL MAJOR POLITICAL FORMATIONS </p><p>TO THE LEFT OF CENTER, WITH CRITICAL SUPPORT IN PARLIAMENT </p><p>FROM FAR-LEFT COMMUNIST RENEWAL (RC).

VOTERS REJECTED A </p><p>REPEAT CENTER-LEFT OPTION IN MAY 2001 ELECTIONS AND GAVE </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S FI A SOLID ENDORSEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE FI-LED GOVERNMENT BERLUSCONI FORMED IN JUNE 2001 </p><p>APPEARS STABLE, ENJOYING MAJORITIES IN BOTH PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>CHAMBERS EVEN WITHOUT THE VOTES OF UNPREDICTABLE LN ALLY </p><p>BOSSI.  IN CONTRACT-WITH-AMERICA STYLE, BERLUSCONI CAMPAIGNED </p><p>FOR OFFICE ON THE BASIS OF AN ACTIVIST PLATFORM TO WHICH FI\'S </p><p>POLITICAL ALLIES ALSO SUBSCRIBED.  THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES </p><p>FACED WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT COALITION ACCORDINGLY CENTER MORE </p><p>ON QUESTIONS OF TACTICS AND TIMING THAN PROGRAM.  POINTING TO </p><p>ELECTION RESULTS AND, AS POLLS REVEAL, HIS CONTINUING </p><p>POPULARITY BERLUSCONI SPEAKS OFTEN NOT ONLY OF HIS MANDATE TO </p><p>GOVERN BUT OF AN OBLIGATION TO USE HIS CHAMBER AND SENATE </p><p>MAJORITIES TO ENACT REFORMIST LEGISLATION.  WHILE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DOESN\'T IGNORE ITS BACK BENCH SENATORS AND MP\'S, </p><p>GOI DECISION MAKING RESTS TODAY, PERHAPS MORE THAN AT ANY </p><p>TIME IN THE REPUBLIC\'S HISTORY, IN THE HANDS OF A FEW, LIKE- </p><p>MINDED POLITICAL LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY: IMPLOSION ON THE CENTER-LEFT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>8.  ONCE UPON A TIME A DISCIPLINED, OPAQUE ITALIAN COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY (PCI) DOMINATED THE LEFT PORTION OF THE POLITICAL </p><p>SPECTRUM AND, AT ITS PEAK, GARNERED ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE </p><p>VOTES CAST IN ITALIAN ELECTIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE PCI WAS SPARED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01744  02 OF 05  081356Z </p><p>THE FALLOUT OF CLEAN HANDS INVESTIGATIONS, SEISMIC EVENTS </p><p>ELSEWHERE (END OF THE BERLIN WALL AND SOVIET EMPIRE\'S </p><p>COLLAPSE) PROPELLED IT TO REFORM ITSELF.  IN 1991 THE BULK OF </p><p>PARTY MEMBERS CONVERTED INTO A SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC LEFT (PDS).  HARD-LINE DISSIDENTS EXITED AND </p><p>FORMED COMMUNIST RENEWAL (RC).  THAT GROUP IN TURN SPLIT IN </p><p>1995 AND AGAIN IN 1998 WHILE, ON THE PDS SIDE, EFFORTS TO </p><p>UNITE WITH OTHER LEFTIST GROUPS LED THE PARTY TO RENAME </p><p>ITSELF (1998) THE DEMOCRATS OF THE LEFT (DS).  NOT ALL OLD- </p><p>LINE PCI ELEMENTS APPRECIATED THESE MOVES, AND FACTIONALISM </p><p>APPEARED IN A NEWLY TRANSPARENT PARTY THAT, IN SUBSEQUENT </p><p>ELECTIONS, LOST HALF ITS PUBLIC SUPPORTERS - IN MAY 2001, THE </p><p>DS WON BARELY 16 PERCENT OF THE VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  MAY 2001 ELECTIONS DEALT SAGGING DS MORALE A FURTHER BLOW </p><p>WHEN A COLLECTION OF DS CENTRIST ALLIES, ALL SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>SMALLER THAN THE DS, COALESCED BEFORE THE ELECTIONS (INTO THE </p><p>"DAISY") AND EMERGED WITH 14-PLUS PERCENT OF THE VOTE.  THIS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT LEFT A DIMINISHING DS SUBJECT TO BOTH INTERNAL </p><p>STRIFE (SOME FACTIONS SAW SALVATION IN MOVING THE PARTY </p><p>FARTHER LEFTWARD, OTHERS IN AFFIRMING A MORE CENTRIST </p><p>VOCATION) AND COMPETITION FROM A RELATIVELY EQUAL CENTRIST </p><p>PARTNER IN LEADING THE OPPOSITION TO BERLUSCONI.

THE CGIL, WITH 5.4 MILLION </p><p>MEMBERS, IS ITALY\'S LARGEST TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION.  ONCE </p><p>SEEN AS THE PCI\'S "TRANSMISSION BELT," ITS TRANSFORMATION </p><p>INTO A PROFESSIONAL, FULLY AUTONOMOUS TRADE UNION INSTITUTION </p><p>WAS COMPLETED UNDER CHARISMATIC SECRETARY GENERAL SERGIO </p><p>COFFERATI.

INDUSTRIAL GROWTH AND ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY IN NORTHERN ITALY HELPED THE TRADE UNIONS GAIN </p><p>STRENGTH AND, WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, THEY BECAME SOLIDLY </p><p>ROOTED INSTITUTIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE WORKERS THEY REPRESENTED </p><p>HAD NO CONTRACTUALLY EQUAL "EMPLOYERS" TO DEAL WITH, THE </p><p>UNIONS USED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NEGOTIATIONS TO ACHIEVE </p><p>ECONOMIC GAINS FROM THEIR "GIVERS OF WORK" ("DATORI DI </p><p>LAVORO" IN ITALIAN).

THE STATUTE\'S TITLE II ("ON TRADE </p><p>UNION LIBERTIES") INCLUDED AN ARTICLE 18 ON JOB </p><p>REINSTATEMENT.

ONE OF THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT\'S MAIN OBJECTIVES - AS </p><p>HAD BEEN THE CASE WITH CENTER-LEFT GOVERNMENTS BEFORE IT - </p><p>WAS TO STIMULATE, MODERNIZE, AND IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVENESS </p><p>OF THE ITALIAN ECONOMY.  DURING THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, </p><p>BERLUSCONI PROMISED BETTER PENSIONS FOR WORKERS, LOWER TAX </p><p>BURDENS FOR EMPLOYERS, AND MORE JOBS FOR EVERYONE.

THINGS CHANGED IN NOVEMBER.  IN PRESENTING LABOR LAW </p><p>PROPOSALS TO PARLIAMENT, THE GOI DOUBLY OFFENDED ALL THREE </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS.  ITS FIRST OFFENSE INVOLVED SEEKING </p><p>AUTHORIZATION ("DELEGA") TO EFFECT SOME LABOR MARKET REFORMS </p><p>ON THE BASIS OF GENERAL GUIDELINES APPROVED BY PARLIAMENT, </p><p>I.E., WITHOUT VETTING THEM FIRST, VIA "CONCERTAZIONE," WITH </p><p>THE UNIONS.  ITS SECOND OFFENSE INVOLVED PROPOSALS TO SUSPEND </p><p>ARTICLE 18 IN CASES INVOLVING (A) ENCOURAGEMENT FOR SMALL </p><p>FIRMS TO GROW (AND CROSS THE 15-WORKER THRESHOLD), (B) </p><p>INDUCEMENT FOR FIRMS OPERATING IN THE INFORMAL ECONOMY TO </p><p>LEGALIZE THEIR STATUS, AND (C) TRANSFORMING SHORT-TERM LABOR </p><p>CONTRACTS INTO "PERMANENT" EMPLOYMENT.  FOR THE UNIONS, THIS </p><p>REPRESENTED AN UNACCEPTABLE GOVERNMENT ATTACK ON A BASIC </p><p>WORKER RIGHT, ONE TO BE RESISTED AT ALL COSTS. </p><p> </p><p>18. THE GOI DID NOT RETREAT, BUT NEITHER DID IT PRESS MATTERS </p><p>IN PARLIAMENT.  THE DEBATE CONTINUED INSTEAD VIA MEDIA </p><p>STATEMENTS AND CONFLICTING SIGNALS FROM ELEMENTS IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT COALITION.  BY THE TIME THE CGIL\'S SCHEDULED </p><p>QUADRENNIAL CONGRESS MET IN RIMINI (2/6-9), "GENERAL STRIKE" </p><p>TALK WAS IN THE AIR.  INVITED GUEST SPEAKER LUIGI ANGELETTI </p><p>(SECRETARY GENERAL OF UIL) COUNSELED CAUTION.  THINGS HAD </p><p>CHANGED, HE SAID, WITH THE ELECTION OF A SAFE-MAJORITY </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE UNIONS COULD NOT FORCE A GOVERNMENT CHANGE </p><p>BY TAKING TO THE STREETS OR STRIKING, BUT THEY COULD CHANGE </p><p>GOVERNMENT POLICY BY WORKING ON PUBLIC OPINION.  INVITED </p><p>SPEAKER SAVINO PEZZOTTA (SECRETARY GENERAL OF CISL) AGREED. </p><p>"SO WE STRIKE," HE SAID; "WHAT DO WE DO THE DAY AFTER?" </p><p> </p><p>19. THE UIL HELD ITS OWN QUADRENNIAL CONGRESS A MONTH LATER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01744  04 OF 05  081357Z </p><p>(3/4-6).  BY THEN, THE CGIL HAD ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A GENERAL </p><p>STRIKE APRIL 5.  INVITED GUEST SPEAKER COFFERATI DREW </p><p>APPLAUSE UNTIL HE TRIED TO JUSTIFY WHAT, FOR UIL DELEGATES, </p><p>WAS UNJUSTIFIABLE - CGIL UNILATERALISM.  THE CGIL HAD DECIDED </p><p>ALONE, COFFERATI EXPLAINED, BECAUSE "CONDITIONS DIDN\'T EXIST" </p><p>FOR THE CONFEDERATIONS TO DECIDE JOINTLY.  LOUD WHISTLES </p><p>RESOUNDED.  SOME WHISTLES ALSO SOUNDED WHEN GUEST SPEAKER </p><p>(LABOR MINISTER) ROBERTO MARONI SPOKE.  HOWEVER, MORE-THAN- </p><p>POLITE APPLAUSE GREETED HIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE GOI HAD "HEARD" </p><p>LABOR\'S DETERMINED PROTEST AND WAS REOPENING THE DOOR TO </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  THE APPROACHING CONFLICT, IT SEEMED, WAS OVER. </p><p> </p><p>20. IT WASN\'T.  "COFFERATI WINS," PROCLAIMED LEFTIST MEDIA. </p><p>CGIL INTRANSIGENCE HAD WON THE DAY - THE GOI HAD ABANDONED </p><p>THE FIELD.  GOI REACTION WAS SWIFT.  IT WOULD PROCEED, AN </p><p>UNCHARACTERISTICALLY HARSH BERLUSCONI ANNOUNCED, WITH PLANS </p><p>TO CHANGE ARTICLE 18.  THE CGIL ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR AN ANTI- </p><p>BERLUSCONI ROME RALLY 3/23.  UIL AND CISL ENDORSED A GENERAL </p><p>STRIKE AND SAID THEY WOULD AIM FOR A DATE IN COMMON WITH THE </p><p>CGIL.  WITH TENSION MOUNTING, RED BRIGADE TERRORISTS STRUCK, </p><p>ASSASSINATING LABOR MINISTRY ADVISER MARCO BIAGI 3/19 (REFS C </p><p>AND D).  FOR SOME, THIS HAD A SOBERING EFFECT.  THE CGIL </p><p>RALLY, WHICH BROUGHT OVER A MILLION PEOPLE TO ROME\'S CIRCUS </p><p>MAXIMUS AND VICINITY, ADDED SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>REPUDIATION OF VIOLENCE TO ITS GOVERNMENT PROTEST AGENDA. </p><p>CGIL JOINED CISL AND UIL IN MOUNTING A NATIONWIDE ANTI- </p><p>TERRORIST PROTEST 3/27.  BUT IN THE MEANTIME LOOSE CANNONS </p><p>FIRED FROM THE GOVERNMENT\'S RANKS.  ONE MINISTER CALLED THE </p><p>3/23 RALLY A "THREAT TO DEMOCRACY;" ANOTHER (BOSSI) SAID </p><p>TERRORISTS WERE "THE CHILDREN" OF LABOR PROTESTS.  HAVING </p><p>THEMSELVES BEEN IN TERRORIST GUNSIGHTS DURING ITALY\'S 1970\'S- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01744  04 OF 05  081357Z </p><p>1980\'S "YEARS OF LEAD," UNION LEADERS EXPLODED.  PUTTING </p><p>ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES, CGIL, CISL, AND UIL SET 4/16 AS </p><p>THEIR COMMON GENERAL STRIKE DAY.  THE UGL, A FOURTH NATIONAL </p><p>TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION GENERALLY SYMPATHETIC TO FINI\'S </p><p>CONSERVATIVE AN, JOINED THE 4/16 GENERAL STRIKE CALL. </p><p>BERLUSCONI DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM HIS MINISTERS\' STATEMENTS </p><p>WHICH, HE SAID, DID NOT REPRESENT HIS GOVERNMENT\'S VIEWS. </p><p>USING CONCILIATORY LANGUAGE, HE AND MARONI REITERATED THE </p><p>GOI\'S OBJECTIVE OF CHANGING ARTICLE 18 BUT INVITED THE UNIONS </p><p>TO RESUME DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>AFTER THE GENERAL STRIKE: GROUNDS FOR PRAGMATISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>21. ITALIANS HAVE SOME SERIOUS ISSUES TO DEAL WITH, AMONG </p><p>THEM JOB CREATION, IMMIGRATION, ASSURING RETIREMENT BENEFITS, </p><p>WORKER SKILLS TRAINING/UPGRADING, INCREASING/EXTENDING </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, STIMULATING INVESTMENT.  THESE ARE </p><p>ISSUES IN WHICH GOVERNMENT, UNIONS, AND EMPLOYERS ALL HAVE A </p><p>STAKE; THEY\'RE NOT MATTERS THAT EASILY LEND THEMSELVES TO </p><p>RESOLUTION BY IDEOLOGY.  IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, REASONABLE </p><p>AND PRAGMATIC GOI, BUSINESS, AND UNION OFFICIALS ARE LIKELIER </p><p>TO FORM THEIR POSITIONS ON THE BASIS OF ECONOMIC DATA THAN ON </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE.  FOR ALL THE DRAMA ATTENDING THEIR </p><p>DISPUTE OVER ARTICLE 18, LEADERS SUCH AS BERLUSCONI, FINI, </p><p>COFFERATI, PEZZOTTA, AND ANGELETTI ARE PRAGMATIC MEN, HEADING </p><p>PRAGMATIC ORGANIZATIONS.

THEY\'LL TALK ABOUT ARTICLE 18\'S REAL RELATIONSHIP TO JOB </p><p>PROTECTION AND INCREASING EMPLOYMENT.  THE ARTICLE "PROTECTS" </p><p>WORKERS IN FIRMS WITH MORE THAN 15 EMPLOYEES FROM BEING </p><p>UNJUSTLY FIRED.  COURTS CAN ORDER WORKERS SO FIRED TO BE </p><p>REINSTATED.  WHILE THE SIZE OF MOST ITALIAN FIRMS (PERHAPS 7 </p><p>OUT OF 8) PUTS THEM BELOW THIS CUTOFF, MOST EMPLOY ONLY 5, 6, </p><p>OR 7 WORKERS, I.E., THEY COULD DOUBLE IN SIZE AND STILL NOT </p><p>CROSS THE 15-WORKER THRESHOLD (AND THUS BE AFFECTED BY THE </p><p>GOI\'S PROPOSED CHANGES).  OF WORKERS WHO WERE "PROTECTED" BY </p><p>ARTICLE 18 IN 2001, PERHAPS 100 WON CASES IN COURT; MOST </p><p>OPTED FOR COMPENSATION RATHER THAN REINSTATEMENT IN THEIR OLD </p><p>POSITION.  HOWEVER, WHATEVER PROTECTION OPTION THEY CHOSE IS </p><p>LIKELY TO HAVE COME AT A PRICE - LONG MONTHS, PERHAPS YEARS, </p><p>OF CASES PROCESSING THROUGH ITALY\'S NOTORIOUSLY SLOW COURTS. </p><p>THE GOI AND UNIONS ARE BOTH NOW TALKING ABOUT "MEDIATION" AND </p><p>"ARBITRATION" - A LIKELY FOCUS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. </p><p> </p><p>23. ITALY\'S NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS AN UNSATISFACTORY </p><p>9.2 PERCENT.  BUT THIS IS AN ARTIFICIAL FIGURE, ONE THAT </p><p>HIDES LOW 3.9 PERCENT REGIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE NORTH </p><p>(WHERE SKILLS SHORTAGES ARE GROWING) AND HIGH 18.8 PERCENT </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE SOUTH.  UNEMPLOYMENT IN ITALY\'S DYNAMIC </p><p>NORTHEAST STANDS AT 3.5 PERCENT (JOBS THERE HAVING GROWN 2.2 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2001).  THIS EMPLOYMENT GROWTH CONTINUES A TREND </p><p>BEGUN IN 1998, WHEN "ATYPICAL" JOB CONTRACTS (I.E., FOR PART </p><p>TIME AND TEMPORARY WORK) WERE LEGALIZED AND PRIVATE </p><p>EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES SUCH AS "MANPOWER" BEGAN OPERATING. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE UNIONS FEARED EMPLOYERS WOULD USE "ATYPICAL" </p><p>CONTRACTS AT THE EXPENSE OF "PERMANENT" JOBS, NEW "PERMANENT" </p><p>JOBS ACCOUNTED FOR MOST EMPLOYMENT GROWTH IN 2001 AND, AT </p><p>MANPOWER, APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT (AND, IN PLACES, UP TO 45 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01744  05 OF 05  081357Z </p><p>PERCENT) OF WORKERS PLACED IN TEMPORARY JOBS WERE CONVERTED </p><p>TO PERMANENT STATUS.  THE GOI AND UNIONS WILL HAVE TO </p><p>CONSIDER WHY THE ARTICLE 18 BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT GROWTH, IF </p><p>THAT\'S WHAT IT IS, PRODUCES SUCH DISPARATE EFFECTS. </p><p> </p><p>24. IF IDEOLOGY PLAYS A ROLE IN UNION/GOVERNMENT DISCUSSIONS, </p><p>IT\'S LIKELY TO BE THE IDEOLOGY OF A PART OF THE GOI\'S AN </p><p>COMPONENT, THE "SOCIAL RIGHT."  THIS "RIGHT" DOES NOT HAVE A </p><p>THATCHERITE GOAL OF SMASHING UNIONS; ITS PATERNALISTIC </p><p>CONCERN IS THE "PROTECTION" OF WORKERS, A CONCERN MANIFESTED </p><p>IN CLOSE TIES WITH TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION UGL.  THEIR </p><p>VOICES, URGING CAUTION FROM WITHIN THE GOI, ARE FINDING ECHO </p><p>AMONG AT LEAST SOME BUSINESSMEN OUTSIDE WHO SEE NOTHING TO </p><p>GAIN FROM GOI/UNION CONFLICT.  A PRAGMATIC BERLUSCONI GOI </p><p>BENT ON MODERNIZING/GOVERNING ITALY WILL VOTE CHANGES INTO </p><p>LAW - BUT ONLY AFTER MUCH MORE TALKING WITH THE UNIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01744 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
