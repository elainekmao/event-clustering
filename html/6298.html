<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, March 12, focuses </p><p>on remarks of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld regarding the </p><p>participation of UK forces in a war with Iraq.  Papers </p><p>characterized the flap over the comments as </p><p>"confusion" within the alliance. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "What happened to America?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official influential Arabic Al-Rai (03/12): </p><p>"Many analysts have not yet determined who is more </p><p>dangerous to world peace and stability: Osama bin </p><p>Laden or George Bush.  Some believe that both these </p><p>men are two sides of the same coin and that both of </p><p>them believe bloodshed and violence to be solutions </p><p>for problems.  The only difference between them is </p><p>that one has more destruction and more dangerous means </p><p>than the other when it comes to eliminating innocent </p><p>civilians.  It is astonishing that a democratic </p><p>country like America and a just and good people like </p><p>the Americans would sink so low and that America\'s </p><p>image would become so ugly as to suggest a force that </p><p>lacks righteousness, justice and lawfulness and that </p><p>dismisses world public opinion and that undertakes </p><p>adventures that could lead to the worst of </p><p>consequences." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The current international order at the crossroads" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Salameh Ukour writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/12):  "We can understand why France, Germany, </p><p>Russia, China and some other industrial countries </p><p>rejected the option to join a U.S.-led war against </p><p>Iraq.  These countries want to protect the current </p><p>international order, its political, legal and security </p><p>establishments, its values and moral principles, and </p><p>its preservation of peace and stability in the world. </p><p>The Bush administration wants to replace the current </p><p>international order with a new order where all the </p><p>countries of the world and people are subject to the </p><p>most powerful country or empire, which is, of course, </p><p>the American empire.. What else could the destructive </p><p>American-British war against Baghdad and Iraqi cities </p><p>mean other than the killing of the Iraqi people, the </p><p>destruction of its civilian, economic and social </p><p>establishments, and taking this country back to the </p><p>Middle Ages?  Is this the democracy, freedom and human </p><p>rights that the United States has always called for?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "death is more dignifying" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/12):  "Yes, we stand against the war and against </p><p>the madness of Bush and his administration, that has </p><p>yet to provide one bit of evidence that justifies its </p><p>aggression against the Arab world..  We are not </p><p>defending regimes and we are not taking sides, but the </p><p>idea of an American occupation is too much.. As for </p><p>those who believe America\'s arguments about Iraq\'s </p><p>possession of weapons of mass destruction and that </p><p>America wants to save the Iraqi people, then let him </p><p>look at the West where there are more nuclear weapons </p><p>than anywhere else, and then look at Israel, the proof </p><p>that America cares nothing for the freedom of Arabs or </p><p>their lives for that matter." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The morals of `Old Europe\'" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/12):  "The European stand, led by France, Germany </p><p>and Russia, against the American-British hegemony </p><p>stems from the maturity and nobleness of European </p><p>political and social thinking.  Old Europe, as the </p><p>U.S. Secretary of Defense calls it, learned lessons </p><p>from the past, and, after having paid a huge price in </p><p>the Second World War, both France and Germany realized </p><p>that war and violence cannot achieve peace, and that </p><p>peace can only be realized with political, economic </p><p>and social development, by achieving social well- </p><p>being, by ending military expansion, and by </p><p>eliminating colonialism.  This advanced political </p><p>thinking is looked down upon by the U.S. </p><p>administration.  For instance, the United States says </p><p>that France does not want to bear its `international </p><p>responsibility\', as if this international </p><p>responsibility, in the eyes of the oil and military </p><p>manufacturing gang in the White House, is simply </p><p>calling for war and launching war on weak countries </p><p>that have strategic locations and resources." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
