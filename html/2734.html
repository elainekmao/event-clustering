<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000708 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR MORIARTY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: PM DEUBA REQUESTS POTUS MEETING IN WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 672 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Prime Minister Deuba has asked for a POTUS </p><p>meeting in Washington during his May 8-13 visit to the U.S. </p><p>to attend the UN Special Session on Children.  If Deuba </p><p>cannot meet with POTUS, he will not travel to DC due to </p><p>domestic political concerns, but still hopes for a SecState </p><p>meeting in New York.  Terrorism - international, regional, </p><p>and within Nepal - would top the agenda of a Bush-Deuba </p><p>meeting.  Post endorses the PM\'s request.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>PM Deuba Asks for White House Call </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Arjun Jung </p><p>Bahadur Singh called in Ambassador April 9 to relate Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s request for a meeting with </p><p>POTUS in Washington during Deuba\'s May 8-13 visit to the U.S. </p><p> Deuba will travel to New York for the UN Special Session on </p><p>Children May 8-10.  The PM would prefer to visit Washington </p><p>May 11-12, but would be willing to fly to DC even during the </p><p>Special Session if that were the only time a White House </p><p>meeting could be arranged.  Singh added that if a POTUS </p><p>meeting were not possible, the PM would cancel the Washington </p><p>leg of his trip out of concerns that his domestic political </p><p>critics would use his failure to get a White House meeting </p><p>against him.  (Note:  As reported Reftel, Deuba continues to </p><p>fight off efforts by a powerful faction within his own party, </p><p>headed by the former PM, to unseat him.  End Note.)  However, </p><p>Deuba would still hope to meet with Secretary Powell in New </p><p>York, Singh stated. </p><p> </p><p>Terrorism to Top Agenda </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Terrorism would top the agenda of PM Deuba\'s White </p><p>House meeting.  Nepal was an early - and ardent - supporter </p><p>of the U.S. initiative against global terrorism, and has been </p><p>working hard to attract international attention to its own </p><p>problems with domestic terrorism in the form of an ongoing </p><p>and increasingly violent Maoist insurgency.  Currently, Deuba </p><p>holds the chair of the South Asian Association for Regional </p><p>Cooperation (SAARC), and the discussion would thus touch on </p><p>regional issues, including the India-Pakistan conflict and </p><p>Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Deuba plans to depart Nepal May 6 with a rest stop in </p><p>Europe on the way to New York.  Following his stay in the </p><p>U.S., Deuba plans to stop over in Brussels for consultations </p><p>with Nepalese diplomats before continuing his journey home. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Domestic Concerns </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) As State Minister Singh made clear, Deuba feels that </p><p>his enemies would make hay if he traveled to Washington </p><p>without meeting the U.S. President.  A POTUS meeting would </p><p>raise his standing both in the party and the wider polity, </p><p>and would underline USG support for Nepal\'s imperiled </p><p>democracy. </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation: Post Endorses Nepal\'s Request </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Post endorses Prime Minister Deuba\'s request for a </p><p>White House meeting.  Nepal is the only country on the Global </p><p>Patterns of Terrorism supplemental list that faces a </p><p>non-Islamic terrorist threat; support for Nepal reinforces </p><p>the USG\'s assertion that we oppose terrorism in all its </p><p>forms.  The meeting would also raise the standing of Deuba - </p><p>a friend of the U.S. - at home at a time when the </p><p>continuation of the incumbent government is a prerequisite </p><p>for a sustainable response to the evolving security threat </p><p>posed by the insurgents. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
