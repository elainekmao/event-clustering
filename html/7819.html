(U)  CLASSIFIED BY DCM RICHARD A. ALBRIGHT FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The UAE last week moved one step closer to </p><p>its goal of assuming total managerial control of </p><p>the Arab Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade </p><p>(ARBIFT) by announcing at the annual general </p><p>meeting (AGM) in Abu Dhabi its formal intention to </p><p>assume the chairmanship of the Board of the bank. </p><p>A new Board of Directors was selected at the AGM; </p><p>that body will meet shortly to choose the chairman </p><p>-- who will be an Emirati.  UAE Finance Ministry </p><p>Undersecretary Khalid Al-Bustani told Econchief May </p><p>5 that he expects the Board will meet within the </p><p>next few weeks. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Comment:  Day-to-day management of ARBIFT </p><p>is completely controlled by Emirati nationals. </p><p>However, the chairmanship of the Board of </p><p>Directors, while largely symbolic, has until now </p><p>been held by a Libyan.  The bank, which is owned </p><p>42.5 percent by Libya, 42.5 percent by the UAE and </p><p>15 percent by Algeria, has since the 1990s been </p><p>designated by OFAC as a Libyan entity.  Currently, </p><p>more than 120 million USD of ARBIFT money (none of </p><p>it payable to or from Libyan entities) is frozen in </p><p>the USA.  The UAEG is eager to seek the </p><p>release/licensing of these funds and hopes that </p><p>replacing the chairman of the board will initiate </p><p>meaningful discussions on a long-term solution to </p><p>the ARBIFT issue which would see the SDN status </p><p>removed and, eventually, Libyan equity </p><p>participation in the bank diluted significantly. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
