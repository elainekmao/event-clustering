<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001453 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT BANS SOUTH AFRICAN LAWYER FROM </p><p>ASSISTING MDC LEGAL CHALLENGE TO ELECTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Todd Faulk for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) The June 19 edition of the independent "Daily News" </p><p>reported that the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) has denied MDC </p><p>President Morgan Tsvangirai\'s request to have renowned South </p><p>African attorney Jeremy Gauntlett represent him in the MDC\'s </p><p>legal challenge to the March presidential election. </p><p>According to the article and embassy sources, for a senior </p><p>attorney or advocate from outside the country to argue cases </p><p>in Zimbabwe, the Minister of Justice (MOJ) must grant an </p><p>exemption certificate in order for the trial to proceed.  In </p><p>Gauntlett\'s case, the Ministry of Justice permsec argued that </p><p>the legal challenge "is not so complex as to require the </p><p>services of a legal practitioner from outside Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>country has, in fact, a number of Senior Counsels who can </p><p>effectively represent your client," the article quoted.  The </p><p>permsec also stated that the MDC should obtain a commitment </p><p>from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for the forex to pay for </p><p>the services of the South African attorney.  (Comment: The </p><p>Reserve Bank, which has a long waiting list for forex, would </p><p>most certainly not give it to the MDC.  This would increase </p><p>the Zim dollar cost to the MDC by about ten times if it went </p><p>to the parallel market.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Gandi Mudzingwa, Tsvangirai\'s principal assistant, </p><p>told poloff that Minister of Justice Patrick Chinamasa has </p><p>decided to make a political issue out the case.  After </p><p>consulting with the MDC\'s lawyers, Mudzingwa believed that </p><p>the only issue is whether or not Gauntlett is registered to </p><p>practice law in Zimbabwe.  However, according to the </p><p>embassy\'s political assistant, who was a practicing attorney </p><p>in Zimbabwe, the Legal Practitioners\' Act is clear on </p><p>stipulating that it is entirely up to the Justice Minister to </p><p>decide whether or not to grant an exemption to foreign </p><p>attorneys.  If Gauntlett is registered here, then MOJ </p><p>permission is not necessary.  However, if he is not </p><p>registered, then the most he could do is draft papers and </p><p>give free advice and instructions to the MDC\'s local </p><p>attorneys.  He could not sit on the bench in court, argue the </p><p>case before the judge, or be named on any documents.  He </p><p>would not be entitled to legal fees under the law, either, </p><p>according to our assistant.  Furthermore, registering to </p><p>practice law in Zimbabwe is a lengthy and cumbersome </p><p>process--it requires sitting for five exams--and there are </p><p>not many foreign attorneys who have done it.  It is not clear </p><p>whether Gauntlett is registered in Zimbabwe, but we presume </p><p>that he is not since the MDC applied for an exemption with </p><p>the High Court. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment: Anyone intending to pay Gauntlett for his </p><p>services in the MDC\'s legal challenge is on shaky legal </p><p>ground.  It might be possible for Gauntlett to agree to </p><p>provide pro bono services in the case, but given the </p><p>restrictions described above on Gauntlett\'s ability to </p><p>operate in Zimbabwe, he may be more apt to offer limited free </p><p>advice in any case.  The MDC\'s options appear limited since </p><p>there are not many South African attorneys registered in </p><p>Zimbabwe, and local senior counsels are subject to </p><p>intimidation and harassment.  Since the MOJ must grant </p><p>exemptions to foreign attorneys on a case-by-case basis, and </p><p>for only a limited period of time, the GOZ could repeatedly </p><p>use this tactic to tilt in its favor the legal challenge </p><p>playing field.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
