<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003989 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PASS TDA FOR STEINGASS/SIGLER </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>E STAFF FOR CADE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, EAID, JO, XF </p><p>SUBJECT: ARAB TELECOM REGULATORS INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Telecommunications Regulatory Commission chief </p><p>Muna Nijem approached USAID director and Econ Couns on </p><p>June 30 about U.S. Government support for an effort she </p><p>is leading to create a network of Arab telecommunications </p><p>regulators.  Nijem said the idea to create a network was </p><p>developed during a regional ITU conference in Algeria </p><p>earlier this year.  Jordan will organize an initial, </p><p>organizational meeting in Amman August 28.  (Algeria has </p><p>the regional ITU chair for 2003, which Jordan will take </p><p>over in 2004.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  According to Nijem, the network will be a </p><p>resource for the development of pro-competitive, consumer- </p><p>focused telecom regulation in the region.  She said it </p><p>would address issues including how operators negotiate </p><p>compatible licenses across borders and regional numbering </p><p>concerns.  In addition to helping regulators operate more </p><p>efficiently, Nijem said that the rationale for the </p><p>initiative was to increase regional economic and </p><p>political cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Nijem asked for assistance prior to the late </p><p>August meeting in pulling together ideas for how a </p><p>network could operate.  Basically, this would mean </p><p>bringing in one outside consultant for a one-month period </p><p>to prepare an agenda for the meeting.  Her initial </p><p>thoughts included creating a web-based "virtual" system </p><p>for sharing ideas among network members as well as </p><p>periodic workshops and seminars.  A network might also </p><p>pool resources to bring in outside experts to address </p><p>regional needs.  Nijem expected that once the August </p><p>meeting had agreed on a general vision, the group would </p><p>commission a full-blown study of how a network would </p><p>operate.  She thought that organizations like the World </p><p>Bank or TDA would be asked to help fund this longer-term </p><p>study. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Comment:  USAID Amman will look into the </p><p>feasibility of bringing in a short-term consultant to </p><p>help Nijem prepare for the August meeting.  Post suggests </p><p>that possibilities for longer-term support for this </p><p>initiative under MEPI and by TDA be studied closely. </p><p>Following the recent acquisition of Jordan\'s "Fastlink" </p><p>mobile operator by Kuwait\'s MTC, and MTC\'s partnership </p><p>with Vodafone in Bahrain, plus Orascom\'s expansion in </p><p>Egypt and North Africa and the various possibilities in </p><p>Iraq, the outlines of a regional mobile network are </p><p>emerging.  By encouraging greater connectivity within the </p><p>region and between the region and the rest of the world, </p><p>this initiative would fit perfectly with our broader </p><p>economic goals for the region, particularly MEFTA.  Nijem </p><p>herself is a forward-leaning, former Motorola executive </p><p>who favors U.S. technology and is among the most senior </p><p>women in the Jordanian government. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
