END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>On to Tokyo </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Sri Lankan government is looking forward to </p><p>the June 9-10 Tokyo donors conference, hoping for a big </p><p>impact both politically and financially.  In a </p><p>conversation with Ambassador Wills on June 5, Minister </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, a key assistant to Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe, said the government hopes that Tokyo </p><p>will provide "a fresh impetus" to the peace process. </p><p>In addition, the government hopes that it will obtain </p><p>the "political, moral and financial support" needed to </p><p>carry on.  Moragoda also said that he hoped Tokyo would </p><p>send the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) "a </p><p>message that their foot stomping and immature behavior" </p><p>will not be rewarded.  (Note:  See Paras 8-9 for the </p><p>prime minister\'s comments on the Tigers\' apparent non- </p><p>participation in Tokyo and their June 4 letter.) </p><p>(Note:  Late June 5, the Ambassador also held a brief </p><p>meeting with Moragoda.  A brief readout of this meeting </p><p>was sent to SA and SA/INS in an unclass e-mail.  Among </p><p>other matters, Moragoda again stressed the importance of </p><p>using the conference to underscore international support </p><p>for the peace process.  In reference to the Tigers\' </p><p>latest demand -- see more below, Moragoda said the GSL </p><p>could support formation of an interim administration in </p><p>the north/east, but only as part of a well-scripted </p><p>process and only after confidence is restored.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) With respect to the financial side (see more on </p><p>pledges in Para 12), Moragoda told the Ambassador that </p><p>he hoped donors at Tokyo would favor what he called a </p><p>"lockbox" approach to pledging.  By this, he said he </p><p>meant that they would express their pledge and say the </p><p>money would be put in a metaphorical lockbox.  That </p><p>lockbox would be unlocked when the LTTE rejoined the </p><p>process in a constructive way, he remarked. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Re the U.S. message at Tokyo, Moragoda commented </p><p>that the peace process was a bit "amorphous" at the </p><p>moment.  He hoped that Deputy Secretary Armitage in his </p><p>remarks will "emphatically state that Sri Lanka needs a </p><p>process, a road map, a new direction and milestones" so </p><p>that the peace attempt reacquires direction.  He kept </p><p>returning to this point throughout the conversation. </p><p>Moragoda also suggested that the two sides need to be </p><p>reminded of the goal they agreed to at the Oslo </p><p>conference in November 2002, namely their joint support </p><p>for formation of a federal structure in a united </p><p>country.  Moragoda added that there was no need for the </p><p>U.S. to get into nitty gritty issues, such as the </p><p>military\'s "high security zones" in Jaffna and whether </p><p>the GSL has moved fast enough to withdraw its troops in </p><p>that area. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Re earlier reports that President Kumaratunga </p><p>would do a video message to be shown at the conference, </p><p>Moragoda said it appears she will not/not do it. </p><p>Moragoda said that might change, however.  (Note: </p><p>Presidential spokesman Harim Peiris told us on June 5 </p><p>that the president would definitely not be doing a video </p><p>and had no plans for involvement in the conference.  He </p><p>said the president and the PM might be meeting before </p><p>the latter\'s departure for Tokyo, but that meeting might </p><p>be put off.  In his meeting late June 5 with the </p><p>Ambassador, Moragoda confirmed that, in the end, the </p><p>president had indeed decided not/not to do the video </p><p>feed.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) On other aspects of the conference, Moragoda </p><p>said Norway will serve as a co-chair and will be </p><p>represented either by the minister or deputy minister of </p><p>development cooperation.  (Note:  See comments of </p><p>Norwegian polchief in Para 10.  Also, see comments in </p><p>Para 11 re possible Indian representation.)  In the </p><p>meantime, the European Union would be represented by Guy </p><p>Legras, External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten\'s </p><p>deputy.  Moragoda said he had just heard that Canada </p><p>will be represented at below the political level and </p><p>will hold back some of their total pledge until the </p><p>Tigers rejoin the whole process. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Closing on an operational note, Moragoda said </p><p>he planned to meet with the four co-chairs (Japan, </p><p>Norway, the EU, and the U.S.) at the conference hotel at </p><p>4:00 P.M. on Sunday, June 8.  He would then meet with </p><p>other officials who were coming to the conference </p><p>(ambassadors, representatives of multilateral </p><p>organizations and international financial institutions, </p><p>etc.) at 5:00 P.M. the same day.  (Note:  Ambassador </p><p>Wills plans to attend both of these meetings, in </p><p>addition to one with representatives of European </p><p>countries at 2:00 P.M. on June 8.)  (Note:  We have e- </p><p>mailed to SA/INS a tentative list of Sri Lankan </p><p>government participants at the Tokyo conference.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Tigers\' probable absence casts Shadow </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) While there are still high hopes for Tokyo, the </p><p>apparent non-participation of the Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is casting a bit of a shadow.  This </p><p>is especially the case given the Tigers\' pointed June 4 </p><p>rejection of the GSL\'s latest offer re assistance </p><p>delivery modalities for the north/east.  (Note:  In its </p><p>latest exchanges with the GSL, the LTTE has not actually </p><p>mentioned Tokyo.  The group, however, has given no </p><p>indication that it plans to reconsider its late April </p><p>decision not to go.  Despite entreaties from a group of </p><p>European envoys visiting the LTTE-controlled Wanni </p><p>region on June 4, for example, the Tigers reportedly </p><p>would give no commitment on going to Tokyo -- a fax has </p><p>been sent to SA/INS with information about this visit. </p><p>The Tigers\' June 4 letter, mentioned above, is reviewed </p><p>in detail in Reftel.  Also, see Septel containing local </p><p>media reaction, which focuses on the Tigers\' letter. </p><p>End Note.)  In a meeting late June 4 with visiting </p><p>Deputy USAID administrator Schieck and the Ambassador, </p><p>PM Wickremesinghe seemed in a very pensive mood </p><p>regarding the peace process, noting that he did not </p><p>expect the LTTE to be present at Tokyo.  Queried about </p><p>the LTTE\'s June 4 letter, the PM said the negative </p><p>response from the Tigers was something the GSL fully </p><p>expected at this point.  The prime minister did not </p><p>indicate how or when the GSL intended to reply to the </p><p>group. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In another conversation late June 4, polchief </p><p>found Bradman Weerakoon, a close adviser to the PM, also </p><p>in a pensive mood.  In comments similar to those we have </p><p>picked up from other government officials, Weerakoon </p><p>said he believed that Tokyo would have a very positive </p><p>impact, but he clearly felt disappointed that the LTTE </p><p>-- at its very own choice -- was apparently not going to </p><p>be there. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Norwegian, Indian Representation in Tokyo </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Regarding his government\'s role at Tokyo, </p><p>Norwegian Embassy polchief Tomas Stangeland confirmed </p><p>Moragoda\'s comments that the GoN would be represented by </p><p>development officials.  There would be political-level </p><p>representation, but at a lower level with Ambassador to </p><p>Sri Lanka Hans Brattskar and some other MFA officials </p><p>present.  Because Norway wanted to maintain its position </p><p>as a "neutral" facilitator (given that the Tigers </p><p>appeared not to be participating), neither Deputy </p><p>Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen nor Special Envoy Erik </p><p>Solheim would be in Tokyo.  Stangeland related that the </p><p>GoN had originally thought that it would try to avoid </p><p>being seen as one of the sponsors of the conference if </p><p>the Tigers did not participate (this, in the interests </p><p>of appearing more "neutral").  The Norwegian government, </p><p>however, had in the end decided to serve as one of the </p><p>co-chairs, he said. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) With respect to India, Taranjit Sandhu, Indian </p><p>High Commission polchief, told us that it was possible </p><p>that the Indian ambassador to Japan would participate in </p><p>the conference.  India, however, did not want to attend </p><p>if the Tigers were there, and it was still not clear </p><p>exactly what the LTTE planned to do.  With the LTTE </p><p>apparently not participating, however, Sandhu thought </p><p>that possibly cleared the way for India to attend. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Expected Pledges </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Re the financial side, donors are gearing up to </p><p>make fairly robust pledges.  Mission has surveyed the </p><p>donor community and collected the following information </p><p>on level of representation and, where available, likely </p><p>pledges (Note -- Some of the information on </p><p>representation was already flagged above): </p><p> </p><p>-- Japan:  Prime Minister to make an opening statement, </p><p>Foreign Minister to attend. </p><p> </p><p>-- EU Commission:  DG of External Affairs Guy Legras. </p><p>Pledge: 20 million Euros. </p><p> </p><p>-- EU Presidency:  Director of Asian Office, Greek MFA. </p><p>Individual member states will pledge. </p><p> </p><p>-- Norway:  Either Minister or Deputy Minister of </p><p>Development Cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>-- Australia:  Australian High Commissioner to Sri </p><p>Lanka, along with a rep from Australian MFA.  Pledge: </p><p>AUD 32 million over two years. </p><p> </p><p>-- Sweden:  Charge of Swedish Embassy in Sri Lanka, </p><p>along with MFA division head for Asia.  Pledge: USD 41 </p><p>million (includes existing program). </p><p> </p><p>-- UK:  DFID Director Asia:  USD 40 million over 3 </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>-- Netherlands:  Dutch Ambassador to Sri Lanka. </p><p>Pledge:  11 million Euros (existing program). </p><p> </p><p>-- Germany:  German Ambassador to Sri Lanka.  Pledge: 13 </p><p>million Euros (existing program). </p><p>-- ADB:  Bank President.  Pledge: USD 200 million </p><p>(existing program; new funding under discussion). </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Original expectations that Tokyo would be "big </p><p>bang" for the peace process are down somewhat.  This is </p><p>mainly due to the fact that the LTTE, of late, has </p><p>thrown a wrench into the process by pulling out of the </p><p>talks and out of Tokyo.  (Note:  The latter decision </p><p>could still be reversed, of course -- there are several </p><p>days left until Tokyo takes place, but it seems very </p><p>unlikely.)  That said, per Moragoda\'s comments, there </p><p>remains a widespread belief among Sri Lankans and among </p><p>most of the donors, including the Japanese and the </p><p>Norwegians, that the conference will provide crucial </p><p>support for the underlying peace process, which </p><p>continues apace and uninterrupted.  Moreover, the fact </p><p>that expectations have come down a bit is basically a </p><p>net positive, as it is easier to surpass them in that </p><p>case.  Nonetheless, with GSL-LTTE relations in a trough, </p><p>Tokyo is set to be seminal moment for the next stage of </p><p>the peace process, especially as efforts are made to get </p><p>it firmly back on track in the coming weeks and months. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
