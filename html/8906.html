<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 002783 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CMGT, CVIS, AMGT, CASC, KU </p><p>SUBJECT:  RESOURCE IMPLICATIONS OF IRAQI VISA PROCESSING IN </p><p>KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KANESHIRO-JONES ET AL JUNE 10 EMAIL (B)PAYNE-JONES </p><p>ET AL JUNE 17 EMAIL  (C) KUWAIT 2781 </p><p> </p><p>1.   This is an action message.  Please see paragraph 10. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Embassy has reviewed the draft memo on the proposed </p><p>  inclusion of Iraq in Kuwait\'s consular district for visa </p><p>  processing on a temporary basis (Ref A). Embassy has also </p><p>  reviewed the initial assessment from the Consular officer in </p><p>  Baghdad of how many Iraqi applicants might be processed </p><p>  through Kuwait (Ref B).  We\'d like to offer our thoughts on </p><p>  the likely resource implications of continued support of </p><p>  Iraq-related consular operations. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Embassy agrees that specific procedures need to be </p><p>  established to process Iraqi visa applications. We </p><p>  understand that Kuwait would only receive applications from </p><p>  Iraqis whose travel is "funded, organized, and sponsored by </p><p>  USG agencies."  The mechanics of the proposal - specifically </p><p>  the SAO pre-clearance process - appear workable.  We will </p><p>  formally advise the Kuwaiti government of the proposal and </p><p>  request its cooperation. The Kuwaitis have always been </p><p>  accommodating to our requests for clearance of official </p><p>  Iraqi travelers. We believe they will continue to be so, </p><p>  provided the numbers remain small and requests for emergency </p><p>  processing on weekends (Thursday/Friday) and after hours </p><p>  remain limited.  It will be crucial to provide the Kuwaitis </p><p>  complete biographic, document, and travel information two </p><p>  work/work days in advance, rigorously respecting the local </p><p>  weekend. In order to meet this deadline the Embassy must </p><p>  receive that information 72 hours in advance and is likewise </p><p>  closed Thursdays and Fridays. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Ref B estimates that 50 travelers per month might be </p><p>  processed through this channel. This seems optimistically </p><p>  low given that we processed 12 Iraqi delegates to a United </p><p>  Nations meeting this past weekend, more applications are on </p><p>  the way, and procedures are not even formally in place.  The </p><p>  very establishment of a reliable mechanism to obtain U.S. </p><p>  visas for official Iraqi travelers will itself stimulate </p><p>  enormous demand for travel. There will also almost certainly </p><p>  be pressure to broaden proposed criteria for visa processing </p><p>  and to make exceptions to those criteria. Our experience </p><p>  with Iraq-related issues convinces us that there will be </p><p>  strong pressure to expand `official\' travel to include any </p><p>  travel in which the USG has an interest.  We expect that </p><p>  requests for exceptions based on humanitarian and other </p><p>  considerations, will quickly follow suit. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Whatever the ultimate number of visa applicants, all </p><p>  will need permission to enter and depart Kuwait, SAOs, an </p><p>  interview with a consular officer, and a visa; some will </p><p>  require passport waivers.  Most of these travelers will be </p><p>  high-profile cases. Experience demonstrates that they </p><p>  require transportation, expeditors, VIP handling, and other </p><p>  kinds of expensive Embassy support. We note that one of the </p><p>  Americans accompanying the Iraqi UN delegation arrived </p><p>  without a Kuwaiti visa and had to be processed separately. </p><p>  All of this activity occurred late at night on the Kuwaiti </p><p>  weekend at considerable overtime cost to the Embassy which </p><p>  so far has not been reimbursed. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Ref B correctly notes that while the proposal is </p><p>  limited to visa processing, Kuwait has already been assigned </p><p>  de facto responsibility for a variety of Iraq-related </p><p>  consular issues. For example, we have already processed two </p><p>  Iraqi parole cases through Kuwait and just submitted a third </p><p>  parole request, this one a high profile case involving a </p><p>  large family group (Ref C). As the Department is aware, </p><p>  these cases are time-consuming, complex affairs requiring </p><p>  extensive coordination between various agencies and between </p><p>  the Embassy and the Kuwaiti government.  As NGOs become </p><p>  increasingly active in southern Iraq we expect many requests </p><p>  for assistance with Iraqis requesting entry to the U.S. for </p><p>  medical treatment. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Processing Iraqi visas is an additional load for our </p><p>  Consular Section, which is already stretched thin by growing </p><p>  workload and staffing gaps. The Section\'s organization chart </p><p>  shows three full time 0-4 vice consuls, one part time 0-4 </p><p>  vice consul, one consular associate, and the Chief of </p><p>  Section. One of the three full time vice consuls departed </p><p>  post two weeks ago and his replacement does not arrive until </p><p>  mid-August.  The second rotates to another Embassy section </p><p>  in August (at the Charge\'s direction that Section is taking </p><p>  a three-month gap to assist the Consular Section) when her </p><p>  replacement arrives.  The third full time position is a new </p><p>  one that will not be filled until November.  The Consular </p><p>  Associate departed Post two weeks ago and probably will not </p><p>  be replaced until August.  The Section Chief is scheduled </p><p>  for FSI training from July 7-25. </p><p> </p><p>8.   On May 14 Embassy requested TDY assistance during the </p><p>  month of July and the first two weeks of August.  On June 3, </p><p>  Embassy learned and immediately informed CA/EX that the part </p><p>  time vice consul, responsible for about half of NIV </p><p>  interviewing, had been reassigned outside Kuwait effectively </p><p>  immediately, not to be replaced until late August at the </p><p>  earliest.  We amended our initial request to ask for </p><p>  immediate TDY assistance. </p><p> </p><p>9.   The Consular Section has been reduced to two officers: </p><p>  the Section Chief and a vice consul.  Two weeks ago we </p><p>  instituted an appointment system to deal with peak seasonal </p><p>  NIV demand.  The wait for an appointment is already three </p><p>  weeks and growing fast.  We have an increasingly busy and </p><p>  always complex ACS portfolio as well. Since May 1, Embassy </p><p>  has received more than 1,200 new consular registrations. </p><p>  This compares to fewer than 200 in the same seven-week </p><p>  period of 2002.  Most of the new registrants are contractors </p><p>  involved in Iraqi reconstruction; the numbers of such people </p><p>  will only continue to grow. Overall, we have more than </p><p>  12,000 registered Americans in Kuwait, almost double the </p><p>  number last year at this time.  The impact of this growth is </p><p>  beginning to be reflected in our numbers.  We expect to </p><p>  receive about 210 passport applications in June, 20% more </p><p>  than during the same month last year, this despite the fact </p><p>  the much of our traditional ACS clientele left Kuwait before </p><p>  the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom and will not return </p><p>  until schools open in September. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Action Request: This Embassy wants to be as helpful as </p><p>  possible in U.S. efforts to reconstruct Iraq, specifically </p><p>  by providing consular services for certain officially </p><p>  designated Iraqis.  However, we also want to convey a </p><p>  realistic appraisal of the resource implications and of our </p><p>  existing staffing shortage.  Some of the resource </p><p>  implications will need to be addressed with the Office of </p><p>  the Coalition Provisional Authority.  Other issues are </p><p>  properly addressed to the Department. We need, on an urgent </p><p>  basis, two TDY consular officers.  Ideally, one would remain </p><p>  until the arrival of the new vice consuls in August and one </p><p>  would remain for as long as Kuwait is the designated </p><p>  processing point for Iraqi official travelers. None of the </p><p>  costs for lodging, equipment or other support for the latter </p><p>  officer should come from Post funds.  We note that our </p><p>  request is consistent with Ref B suggestion that "at least </p><p>  one" TDY officer be assigned to Kuwait to assist with Iraq- </p><p>  related consular issues.  Assistance appreciated. </p><p> </p><p>11.  This message has been cleared by OCPA. </p><p></p></div>
