<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 214855 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER,  PARIS FOR RAVELING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SA, AF, RS </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN:  ENGAGING THE SAUDIS ON THE TALIBAN </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR DEMPSEY; MOSCOW PLS PASS TO INR A/S GATI </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A)   STATE 204146 (NOTAL)  B) STATE 204251  (NOTAL) </p><p>C)  STATE 203329 (NOTAL)   D. ISLAMABAD 8520  (NOTAL) </p><p>E)  RIYADH 4122 </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) CLASSIFIED BY ROBIN L. RAPHEL, ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>OF STATE FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS,   DOS.   REASON: 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) GID DIRECTOR PRINCE TURKI RECENTLY HELD MEETINGS IN </p><p>WASHINGTON WITH THE NSC AND CIA AT WHICH HE DISCUSSED, </p><p>AMONG OTHER SUBJECTS, THE TALIBAN PHENOMENON, AND EXCHANGED </p><p>ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENTS ABOUT THE MOVEMENT.     THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>IS VERY INTERESTED IN ENGAGING REGULARLY WITH THE SAUDIS ON </p><p>THEIR POLICY TOWARDS AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) EMBASSY RIYADH IS REQUESTED TO INITIATE PERIODIC </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SAUDIS SO WE CAN GET A </p><p>BETTER ASSESS THEIR VIEWS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE </p><p>SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN AND OF THEIR CONTACTS OR INFLUENCE </p><p>WITH THE TALIBAN.  WE WANT TO ASK THE SAUDIS TO ENGAGE WITH </p><p>THE TALIBAN CONSTRUCTIVELY ON ISSUES OF CONCERN TO US SUCH </p><p>AS TERRORISM--CLOSING THE MILITANT TRAINING CAMPS AND </p><p>EXPELLING OSAMA BIN LADEN. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) WE ALSO WISH TO ENCOURAGE THE SAUDIS TO USE </p><p>WHATEVER INFLUENCE THEY MAY HAVE WITH THE TALIBAN TO PRESS </p><p>THEM TO STOP THE FIGHTING IN THE NORTH AND TO REACH A </p><p>POLITICAL ACCOMMODATION WITH MASOOD AND DOSTAM TOWARDS </p><p>BUILDING A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. </p><p>CONTINUING THE FIGHTING IS DESTABLIZING TO THE REGION AND </p><p>RISKS AN ETHNIC DIVISION OF THE COUNTRY.   THE RUSSIANS AND </p><p>THE CENTRAL ASIANS HAVE ALL REACTED STRONGLY TO THE </p><p>PERCEIVED TALIBAN THREAT.   POST SHOULD INQUIRE AS TO SAUDI </p><p>PLANS TO ENGAGE WITH THE TALIBAN AUTHORITIES IN KABUL. </p><p>POST MAY WISH TO DRAW ON GENERAL TALKING POINTS TO BE SENT </p><p>BY SEPTEL,  PREVIOUS GUIDANCE IN REFS A AND B AND THEN FOCUS </p><p>ON THE SUGGESTED POINTS BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C)  SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RUSSIAN AND CENTRAL ASIAN CONCERNS </p><p> </p><p>--   THE RUSSIANS AND THE CENTRAL ASIAN STATES HAVE ALL </p><p>CONVEYED TO US THEIR CONCERNS OVER THE TAKEOVER OF KABUL BY </p><p>THE TALIBAN AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF TALIBAN RULE IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN FOR REGIONAL STABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>--   THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE MOVES NORTHWARD, </p><p>PARTICULARLY TOWARD THE TAJIK BORDER.   IN RESPONSE, </p><p>PRESIDENT YELTSIN CALLED A SUMMIT OF THE CIS STATES THAT </p><p>WAS HELD IN ALMATY OCTOBER 4-5. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE SUMMIT CALLED ON THE AFGHAN RIVAL PARTIES TO STOP </p><p>THE FIGHTING AND TO NEGOTIATE.   THE CIS LEADERS WARNED </p><p>THAT THEY WILL TAKE MEASURES TO REINFORCE THEIR BORDERS, </p><p>AND THEY RESERVED THE RIGHT TO "TAKE ADEQUATE MEASURES" </p><p>SHOULD AFGHANISTAN\'S HOSTILITIES SPILL OVER THE BORDER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>URGE AN END TO THE FIGHTING </p><p> </p><p>--   WE RECENTLY SPOKE WITH A TALIBAN REPRESENTATIVE IN </p><p>ISLAMABAD.   WE URGED THE TALIBAN IMMEDIATELY TO REACH A </p><p>POLITICAL ACCOMMODATION WITH BOTH DOSTAM AND MASOOD. </p><p> </p><p>--   WE ARGUED THAT AN EXPANSION OF THE FIGHTING INTO </p><p>NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN WOULD COMPOUND THE ANXIETIES OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN\'S NORTHERN NEIGHBORS WHO ALREADY PERCEIVE THE </p><p>TALIBAN TO BE A THREAT TO THEIR STABILITY AND WAY OF LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>--   WE ALSO WARNED THAT CONTINUED FIGHTING COULD </p><p>PRECIPITATE AN UNWANTED INTERVENTION BY RUSSIA,  IRAN, OR </p><p>SOME OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN STATES.   SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD </p><p>NOT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF EITHER THE TALIBAN OR </p><p>AFGHANISTAN AS A WHOLE. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE TALIBAN REPRESENTATIVE\'S RESPONSE WAS THAT THE </p><p>TALL BAN HAVE "NO PROBLEM" WITH EITHER DOS TAM OR THE AFGHAN </p><p>TAJIKS.   HOWEVER, THEY DO NOT TRUST MASOOD AND INSISTED HE </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH.   DOSTAM WOULD NEED TO DISARM </p><p>HIS FORCES AS PART OF A DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN.   AT THE </p><p>PRESENT TIME, THE TALIBAN ARE NOT PLANNING TO PUT ?RESSURE </p><p>ON THE HAZARA SHIAS. </p><p> </p><p>--   THIS RESPONSE IS LESS THAN REASSURING TO US AND OTHERS </p><p>WHO FEAR THE SPREAD OF GREATER INSTABILITY IN THE REGION </p><p>AND WHO BELIEVE THAT A MILITARY SOLUTION IS NOT A LONG TERM </p><p>SOLUTION FOR AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>--   WE ASK THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT USE WHATEVER INFLUENCE IT </p><p>HAS WITH THE TALL BAN TO STRESS THAT CONTINUED FIGHTING </p><p>INVITES GREATER INSTABILITY,  POSSIBLE ACTIVE INTERVENTION </p><p>BY FOREIGN POWERS AND RISKS AN ETHNIC DIVISION OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>--   WE ALSO SEEK YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>ENCOURAGING THE TALIBAN TO CLOSE TERRORIST/MILITANT </p><p>TRAINING CAMPS IN TERRITORY THEY CONTROL AND TO EXPEL NON- </p><p>AFGHANS INVOLVED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>--   WE HAVE HEARD CONFLICTING REPORTS ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF </p><p>OSAMA BIN LADEN.   HE MIGHT STILL BE IN TALIBAN-CONTROLLED </p><p>TERRITORY.   WE HAVE CONVEYED TO THE TALIBAN AND OTHER </p><p>AFGHAN LEADERS THAT THE PRESENCE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN IS NOT </p><p>HELPFUL TO AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH </p><p> </p><p>--   ON ONE FINAL MATTER REGARDING FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH, </p><p>WE WISH TO CLARIFY OUR POSITION ON HIS POSSIBLE RETURN TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.   WE DO NOT OPPOSE HIS DESIRE TO RETURN TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN TO HELP REUNIFY THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN FACT, WE WOULD NOT OPPOSE THE EFFORTS OF ANY </p><p>INDIVIDUAL WHO COULD BRING ABOUT A PEACEFUL AFGHANISTAN </p><p>UNDER A STABLE, REPRESENTATIVE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TALBOTT </p><p></p></div>
