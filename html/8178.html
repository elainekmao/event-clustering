ACTION: THIS CABLE IS FOR AMBASSADOR J. SULLIVAN\'S </p><p>IMMEDIATE ATTENTION FOR USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS TDY </p><p>CONSULTATIONS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary: The final Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment </p><p>Committee (ZIMVAC) April (2003) update and joint U.N. World </p><p>Food Programme (WFP) and Food and Agriculture Organization </p><p>(FAO) Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM) report </p><p>have not yet been released, despite promises of release for </p><p>the past several weeks.  According to highly reliable </p><p>sources, Zimbabwe\'s total maize production for the </p><p>recent/current (2002/03) harvest is estimated at 820,000 </p><p>Metric Tons (MT), an approximately 65 percent (%) increase </p><p>over last year\'s result.  When combined with the estimated </p><p>production levels of other cereal crops (wheat, millets), </p><p>total cereals production in 2002/03 is estimated at </p><p>1,035,000 MT.  Adding various modest amounts of estimated </p><p>carryover stocks, winter maize production, remaining food </p><p>aid (pipeline) stocks and other miscellaneous on-farm stocks </p><p>results in an estimated 950,000 MT of total available maize </p><p>and 1,200,000 MT of all cereals for the 2003/04 </p><p>marketing/consumption year. </p><p> </p><p>3. Applying the new reduced population estimate from the </p><p>latest census in 2002, Zimbabwe\'s projected food needs in </p><p>2003/04 are estimated at 1,675,000 MT for maize only, and </p><p>2,205,000 MT for all cereals.  If one reduces these figures </p><p>to human consumption requirements only, total national </p><p>requirements for maize are estimated at 1,425,000 MT, and </p><p>human requirements for all cereals are estimated at </p><p>1,955,000 MT. </p><p> </p><p>4. Based on these figures, Zimbabwe\'s estimated food gap </p><p>amounts to 725,000 MT for maize only, and about 1 million MT </p><p>for all cereals for the 2003-04 marketing/consumption year </p><p>(through April 2004).  Similarly, if one removes the non- </p><p>human (livestock/other) portion of these amounts, the 2003- </p><p>04 maize gap is reduced to about 485,000 MT, and the total </p><p>cereals gap to about 725,000 MT.  Finally, accounting for </p><p>approximately 275,000 MT of already confirmed/planned food </p><p>imports from various sources, the final projected Zimbabwe </p><p>maize deficit would be 485,000 MT (235,000 MT without </p><p>livestock/other non-human requirements), and 725,000 MT for </p><p>all cereals (475,000 MT without livestock/other non-human </p><p>requirements). </p><p> </p><p>5. At current international market rates, these imports will </p><p>cost approximately US$100 million for maize, and $150 </p><p>million for all cereals.  Given the current sorry state of </p><p>GOZ finances, it remains highly questionable how much of </p><p>this food import requirement the government will be able to </p><p>meet.  The Mission hopes to have preliminary estimates of </p><p>this amount shortly.  Until we receive this information, it </p><p>will remain difficult to determine projected international </p><p>and USG food assistance requirements for this year. </p><p>However, although clearly less than last year\'s </p><p>requirements, the magnitude and localized geographic and </p><p>socio-economic distribution of the need, in combination with </p><p>failed local markets, suggest that food aid will continue to </p><p>be required in 2003/04.  If one assumes that a 50/50 split </p><p>between government and international donors might be a </p><p>reasonable estimate for meeting this food gap, international </p><p>donor food aid requirements would amount to approximately </p><p>250,000 MT for maize, and 375,000 MT for all cereals. </p><p>Assuming the USG maintains its contribution at its current </p><p>40% share of the total requirements, USG food assistance to </p><p>Zimbabwe would amount to between 100,000 and 150,000 MT of </p><p>food, valued at between approximately US$55 and $82 million. </p><p>The emphasis for such assistance would be on the southern </p><p>and western areas of the country, which experienced large- </p><p>scale or total crop failures this year, and on specific </p><p>highly vulnerable groups. </p><p> </p><p>6. The Mission will provide more details on these subjects </p><p>as soon as the aforementioned final ZIMVAC and CFSAM reports </p><p>are released.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>THE 2002/03 CROP HARVEST FORECAST </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. Although the final ZIMVAC April 2003 update and the </p><p>WFP/FAO CFSAM report are not yet officially released, the </p><p>2003/04 crop production and vulnerability estimates for </p><p>Zimbabwe are close to final.  According to highly reliable </p><p>sources, the projected 2002/03 production figure for maize </p><p>will be about 820,000 MT.  Although 65% higher than last </p><p>year\'s dismal production (498,500 MT), this total remains </p><p>only 55% of production in 2000/01 (1,476,240 MT) and less </p><p>than half (48%) of Zimbabwe\'s 1990s average maize production </p><p>(1,705,825 MT), signifying the continuing negative impact of </p><p>erratic weather, the government\'s chaotic land </p><p>redistribution program and its gross policy failures over </p><p>the past several years affecting all aspects of the </p><p>agricultural production system including on-farm operations, </p><p>producer incentives and shortages of essential agricultural </p><p>inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and draught power (fuel). </p><p>Other cereals\' production (wheat, millet) is expected to be </p><p>similar to last year\'s levels (150,000 MT and 65,000 MT, </p><p>respectively).  This yields a total projected cereal </p><p>production for 2002/03 in Zimbabwe of 1,034,500 MT (over 40% </p><p>higher than last year\'s 726,000 MT, but also less than half </p><p>of normal/average cereal production in Zimbabwe).  When one </p><p>adds modest amounts of estimated carryover stocks (maize - </p><p>26,000 MT, all cereals - 62,000 MT), an estimated 10,000 MT </p><p>of winter maize production, about 93,000 MT of available </p><p>food aid (pipeline) stocks and a small amount (3,000 MT) of </p><p>unmonitored on-farm stocks to these totals, total maize </p><p>availability for 2003/04 in Zimbabwe rises to about 950,000 </p><p>MT, and the availability of all cereals increases to </p><p>1,202,000 MT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>THE PROJECTED 2003/04 FOOD AID NEEDS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. Applying the new reduced population estimate from the </p><p>latest (2002) census of 11,770,000 people (reduced from </p><p>13,600,000 population figure used last year), Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>projected food needs in 2003/04 are estimated at 1,675,000 </p><p>MT for maize only, and 2,205,000 MT for all cereals, </p><p>including 177,000 MT of millet and 341,000 MT of wheat, as </p><p>well as 250,000 MT of maize for livestock and other non- </p><p>human purposes.  If one reduces these figures to human </p><p>consumption requirements only, total national maize </p><p>requirements are estimated at 1,425,000 MT, and all cereals </p><p>human requirements are estimated at 1,955,000 MT.  Note: </p><p>Although some have questioned the methodology of the census </p><p>and, hence, the accuracy of the reduced population figures, </p><p>these reduced numbers are widely accepted by donors in light </p><p>of the rapid increase in outward migration and increased </p><p>deaths from HIV/AIDS.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>9. Based on these figures, Zimbabwe\'s estimated food gap </p><p>amounts to 725,000 MT for maize only, and about 1 million MT </p><p>for all cereals for the 2003-04 marketing/consumption year </p><p>(through April 2004).  Similarly, if one removes the non- </p><p>human (livestock/other) portion of these amounts, the 2003- </p><p>04 maize gap is estimated at 485,000 MT, and the total </p><p>cereals gap at 725,000 MT.  Note: While this gap compares </p><p>favourably to last year\'s estimated deficit of approximately </p><p>1.3 million MT for maize and approximately 1.5 million MT </p><p>for all cereals, a large proportion of this reduction is </p><p>attributable to the reduced national consumption requirement </p><p>due to the revised population figure noted above.  Hence, </p><p>the significant reduction in the estimated 2003/04 food gap </p><p>is attributable both to increased supply, through the </p><p>increased production (+65%) in the 2002/03 growing season, </p><p>as well as reduced demand, through the decreased national </p><p>consumption requirement (-17%) for the 2003/04 </p><p>marketing/consumption year.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>10. Best available estimates indicate that approximately </p><p>275,000 MT of imports have already been purchased/programmed </p><p>for Zimbabwe for arrival over the coming months.  This total </p><p>projected import figure includes approximately 95,000 MT of </p><p>food aid (including 80,000 MT of maize and 15,000 MT of </p><p>millets) and 180,000 MT of commercial imports (including </p><p>160,000 MT of maize and 20,000 MT of wheat).  Note: </p><p>Reliable figures are not yet available for wheat due to the </p><p>later timing and increased uncertainty regarding this winter </p><p>crop, grown primarily by Zimbabwe\'s former white commercial </p><p>farmers.  However, preliminary figures estimate an </p><p>approximate 163,000 MT deficit for this critical urban </p><p>market commodity this marketing/consumption year.  End Note. </p><p>Taking these confirmed import plans into account yields a </p><p>final projected Zimbabwe maize deficit of 485,000 MT (or </p><p>235,000 MT without livestock/other non-human requirements), </p><p>and 725,000 MT for all cereals (or 475,000 MT without </p><p>livestock/other non-human requirements).  Note:  The </p><p>projected food aid imports appear to be reasonable on the </p><p>basis of available country information.  However, the </p><p>commercial import numbers remain to be verified, principally </p><p>with the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) parastatal Grain </p><p>Marketing Board (GMB).  Also, these figures include no </p><p>provision for any strategic food reserve or buffer/carryover </p><p>stocks at the end of the marketing/consumption year in April </p><p>2004.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>VULNERABLE POPULATIONS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. According to reliable sources, the April ZIMVAC update </p><p>will indicate that a total estimated maximum of 3.9 million </p><p>rural Zimbabweans would be at severe risk due to food </p><p>insecurity by the end of the 2003/04 marketing/consumption </p><p>year.  Note:  The ZIMVAC did not explicitly assess urban </p><p>population needs, which, according to reasonable estimates, </p><p>could add as many as 1 million additional people to this </p><p>figure.  End Note.  As might be expected, given local </p><p>planting/harvest seasons, the total estimated numbers of </p><p>vulnerable people increase throughout the year, from a low </p><p>of 600,000 people in April/May 2003 to the 3.9 million </p><p>maximum starting in January 2004.  Geographically, these </p><p>people are primarily situated in the poorer, drier and </p><p>chronically food insecure regions of southern and western </p><p>Zimbabwe, including Matebeleland North and South and some of </p><p>the central and southern parts of Midlands, Masvingo, and </p><p>Manicaland Provinces.  However, "pockets" of severe </p><p>vulnerability also exist within other similarly poor areas </p><p>of the country that experienced major/total crop failures </p><p>this year (e.g., northern areas of the Mashonaland, Midlands </p><p>and Manicaland Provinces), as well as within specific socio- </p><p>economic groups, such as ex-commercial farm workers, "fast- </p><p>track" resettlers and the urban poor. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>EXISTING COUNTRY CONSTRAINTS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. GOZ Finances: The above estimates suggest that Zimbabwe </p><p>will require a total of 725,000 MT of maize imports in the </p><p>2003/04 marketing consumption year, including 485,000 MT of </p><p>new/additional imports (including 250,000 MT of </p><p>livestock/other non-human requirements).  Similarly, the </p><p>country will require a total of about 1 million MT of all </p><p>cereals imports this year, including about 725,000 MT of </p><p>new/additional imports (including 250,000 MT of </p><p>livestock/non-human requirements).  At current international </p><p>market rates, these additional food imports will cost </p><p>approximately US$100 million for maize (@ US$ 200/MT), and </p><p>$150 million for all cereals (applying the current estimated </p><p>commercial market cost of wheat for Zimbabwe of US$ 200/MT </p><p>for the additional "other cereal" amounts, as wheat will </p><p>comprise the bulk of these additional requirements).  Given </p><p>the current sorry state of GOZ finances, it remains highly </p><p>questionable how much of this additional FX food import </p><p>requirement the government will be able to meet.  The </p><p>Mission hopes to have preliminary estimates of this amount </p><p>shortly. </p><p> </p><p>13. Domestic Markets: Given the significant remaining </p><p>numbers of vulnerable populations and their localized </p><p>geographic and socio-economic situation, it remains highly </p><p>doubtful that significant quantities of grain from surplus- </p><p>producing areas in the north will be effectively </p><p>redistributed at affordable prices to those most in need in </p><p>the southern and western grain-deficit areas of the country. </p><p>This doubt stems from several factors.  First, although the </p><p>GOZ has raised producer prices for the major cereals to more </p><p>attractive levels, these new prices still fall well short of </p><p>international/regional market parity.  Hence, it remains </p><p>questionable how much "surplus" grain will actually be sold </p><p>to/purchased by the GMB for redistribution through market </p><p>channels (as opposed to being retained for own/family use </p><p>and/or sold through illicit black market or cross-border </p><p>channels).  Second, the significant "distortions" observed </p><p>in last year\'s food markets, through such practices as </p><p>hoarding, corruption, black marketeering and </p><p>biased/selective sales/distributions, raise serious doubts </p><p>regarding whether this year\'s markets will function any more </p><p>effectively under even more localized conditions of </p><p>continuing food scarcity.  As a result, the reduced gap </p><p>cited above may not necessarily translate into increased </p><p>access for Zimbabwe\'s most vulnerable populations.  Third, </p><p>any limited quantities of food which do become available for </p><p>sale through local normal (or black) markets will likely be </p><p>unaffordable for the vulnerable target population, who have </p><p>already depleted most of their limited assets and exhausted </p><p>most other coping mechanisms.  And, finally, </p><p>continued/increasing FX and fuel shortages are expected to </p><p>place continuing severe constraints on government efforts to </p><p>transport food to where it is required.  For these reasons, </p><p>continued, more targeted food assistance will be required to </p><p>help address these market failures and ensure that those </p><p>particular vulnerable groups and areas that truly need help </p><p>can get it. </p><p> </p><p>14. Urban Requirements:  Wheat - a primary food staple of </p><p>the urban poor - is already in extremely short supply in </p><p>Zimbabwe (with formal opening stocks estimated at about </p><p>28,000 MT or about one month\'s supply).  With no significant </p><p>harvest expected for this winter crop until October (2003), </p><p>this situation is only expected to worsen over the coming </p><p>months.  In the absence of affordable wheat, urban consumers </p><p>will have no choice but to continue to substitute available </p><p>maize meal to meet their daily food requirements.  This </p><p>additional demand (estimated as high as 15,000 MT/month) </p><p>will place significant pressure on the limited maize stocks </p><p>that do manage to make it into local markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>PROJECTED DONOR FOOD RELIEF REQUIREMENTS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. In the absence of stated government plans for projected </p><p>additional commercial food imports, it is difficult to </p><p>determine what the total international food relief </p><p>requirements will be over the 2003/04 marketing/consumption </p><p>year.  However, although clearly less than last year\'s </p><p>requirements, the magnitude and localized geographic and </p><p>socio-economic distribution of the need, in combination with </p><p>failed local markets, suggest that food aid will continue to </p><p>be required in 2003/04, especially during the "hungry" </p><p>season when this year\'s harvests run out.  If one assumes a </p><p>reduced government capacity to meet these continuing </p><p>substantial food import requirements this year, a 50/50 </p><p>split between government and international donors might be a </p><p>reasonable estimate for meeting this food gap (as opposed to </p><p>the approximate 3/1 split which occurred last year). </p><p>According to this "ballpark" estimate, international donor </p><p>food aid requirements would amount to approximately 250,000 </p><p>MT for maize, and 375,000 MT for all cereals.  Assuming </p><p>further that the USG maintains its contribution at its </p><p>current 40% share of total requirements, USG food assistance </p><p>to Zimbabwe would amount to between 100,000 and 150,000 MT </p><p>of food, valued at between approximately US$55 and $82 </p><p>million.  Note:  The increased cost of this USG assistance </p><p>relative to the global commercial estimates cited above </p><p>results from the additional international transport, </p><p>shipping and handling/management (ITSH) costs associated </p><p>with official USG assistance.  End Note.  For comparative </p><p>purposes, these estimated requirements are approximately </p><p>between 50% and 75% of total USG contributions to Zimbabwe </p><p>over the past year. </p><p> </p><p>16. The emphasis of food assistance over the coming year </p><p>should be on the southern and western areas of the country </p><p>which experienced large-scale or total crop failures this </p><p>year, and on specific highly vulnerable groups, such as </p><p>children (especially, but not exclusively under five years </p><p>of age), pregnant and/or lactating mothers, the elderly, </p><p>chronically ill and disabled, female and child-headed </p><p>households, those affected and infected by HIV/AIDS, and </p><p>special socio-economic groups such as ex-commercial farm </p><p>workers and the urban poor.  Based primarily on the ZIMVAC </p><p>results noted above, revised eligibility criteria and </p><p>targeting procedures are now being developed in accordance </p><p>with these more selective food aid targeting requirements. </p><p>Note:  The controversial issue of international assistance </p><p>for newly resettled "fast-track" farmers remains a subject </p><p>which needs to be addressed; however, it is significant to </p><p>note that needs appear to be minimal among this group with </p><p>only 20% of the population reported to require external </p><p>assistance.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MISSION COMMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. While the country\'s food security situation is certainly </p><p>much improved over this time last year, the magnitude and </p><p>nature of the needs suggests that food assistance will </p><p>continue to be required over the next marketing/consumption </p><p>year, especially during the "hungry" season when this year\'s </p><p>harvests run out.  The major outstanding question is what </p><p>proportion of the estimated food gap/import requirements </p><p>will government be able to cover through its own means, </p><p>given the deplorable state of the country\'s finances and </p><p>credit, and the many critical competing demands on scarce </p><p>available FX.  Government is currently reviewing these </p><p>figures, and we hope to receive a response to this question </p><p>in the near future.  The Mission will advise on this </p><p>information as soon as it is received. </p><p> </p><p>18. Note: The Mission has just learned that government is </p><p>disputing some of the figures in ZIMVAC cited above.  While </p><p>it is unclear exactly which numbers the government is </p><p>contesting, given the politics surrounding the current </p><p>country situation, the Mission expects that the basic </p><p>(maize) production figures cited above are at the center of </p><p>this dispute.  While this predictable development will </p><p>probably serve to delay the release of the final ZIMVAC </p><p>update report, it is not/not expected to significantly alter </p><p>the estimates provided herein (which are also well supported </p><p>by the anticipated WFP/FAO CFSAM results).  Hence, the </p><p>Mission recommends that, at least for the time being, these </p><p>numbers remain the focus of future USG planning discussions </p><p>for the on-going food security crisis in Zimbabwe.  End </p><p>Note.  #Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
