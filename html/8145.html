<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000911 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W </p><p>STATE PASS CDC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AMED, TBIO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: WGSARS01: NIGERIA REPORTS SARS FATALITY IN KANO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. A Ministry of Health official confirmed media reports that </p><p>a Taiwanese businessman died of SARS May 9 in Kano. The </p><p>official told Emboff May 15 that six workers at the hospital </p><p>that treated the businessman subsequently had fallen ill, but </p><p>all have since recovered. The Ministry has reported this case </p><p>to the World Health Organization (WHO), the official noted. </p><p>He said two alleged cases in Port Harcourt reported by the </p><p>media have not been confirmed. The Ministry did not believe </p><p>these were SARS cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The Ministry of Health\'s Emergency Procedures and Response </p><p>Division has established a SARS surveillance program in </p><p>coordination with the WHO. The official noted that should </p><p>SARS spread in the general population, it will be difficult </p><p>to quarantine carriers of the virus from others suffering </p><p>from diseases with similar symptoms, such as malaria. </p><p>Comment: Most Nigerian medical facilities are unlikely to </p><p>have sufficient technical capacity to definitively diagnose </p><p>SARS. In fact, it is our understanding that the case reported </p><p>to the WHO was based on a symptomatic rather than laboratory </p><p>diagnosis. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
