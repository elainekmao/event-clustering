<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003071 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR EB/IP, AF/W AND PLEASE PASS TO FTC FOR RDAMTOFT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN ANTI-TRUST BILL WENDING WAY THROUGH </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY: FTC HELP REQUESTED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 200906 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  The following answers are cued to questions in paragraph </p><p>three of reftel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a.  The September conference that Basil Udotai referred to in </p><p>his communication with the FTC was the first of four seminars </p><p>on competition policy that the Executive and Legislative </p><p>branches of the Niegrian Government are holding.  Udotai is a </p><p>lawyer who is helping to organize the conference in </p><p>affiliation with the Attorney General\'s office.  Also </p><p>involved are individuals in the Presidency, Vice President\'s </p><p>office and Ministry of Commerce and Industry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. Dr. Abdul Muyassir Ladan is unknown to House of </p><p>Representatives Privatization Committee Chair Chidi Duru. </p><p>Our contacts at the Ministry of Commerce were unavailable to </p><p>confirm his bona fides.  We will provide more information if </p><p>it becomes available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c.  Doyin Oyetunde and the Law Union are also organizers of </p><p>the four seminars mentioned in (a) above.  The second seminar </p><p>is scheduled for December 5-6 in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. We have learned that the Privatization Committee of the </p><p>House of Representatives is "gazetting" draft anti-trust </p><p>legislation and expects to have the first reading of the Bill </p><p>before Christmas adjournment.  A vote presumably would come </p><p>around mid-2002. The Mission encourages whatever support the </p><p>FTC can lend to the development and implementation of a </p><p>competition policy in Nigeria.  Chidi Duru has told us that </p><p>the GON would value FTC participation in the seminar series </p><p>(the last two will be in Abuja in February and May of 2002) </p><p>and FTC advice on implementing the new legislation when it </p><p>becomes law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3, Embassy Abuja contact is Economic Officer Tim Smith, </p><p>234-9-670-0375, (H) 234-9-413-5698 and e-mail </p><p>TFSmith52@aol.com. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
