<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004423 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: KERAK: A CASE STUDY OF THE WOMEN\'S QUOTA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM David Hale for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On July 7, Poloff paid a call to Zakeyeh Shamayleh, </p><p>one of the newly-elected women to Parliament who benefited </p><p>from the women\'s quota.  Shamayleh, a retired principal, is a </p><p>member of a small tribe near Kerak, which saw the women\'s </p><p>quota as an opportunity to elect one of its members to </p><p>Parliament.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>QUOTA BENEFITS WOMEN...AND SMALL TRIBES </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloff visited Zakeyeh Shamayleh in Kerak on July 7 to </p><p>congratulate her on her Parliamentary victory.  Poloff found </p><p>Shamayleh reticent and a bit overwhelmed by her new-found </p><p>status.  Already she is exhausted by the job and complained </p><p>to Poloff that she had lost five kilos since the election </p><p>because of stress.  While Shamayleh bustled around the house </p><p>for tea and sweets, her husband explained the benefits of the </p><p>quota for women, especially those who live outside of Amman. </p><p>After tea and sweets, Poloff asked Shamayleh about her agenda </p><p>for Parliament and what she would bring to the seat. </p><p>Shamayleh appeared a bit unfocused and mentioned the poverty </p><p>in her area and bringing jobs to her constituents, but no </p><p>specific agenda, particularly with regards to women\'s issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Poloff then asked what inspired Shamayleh to run for </p><p>Parliament, as she had no previous political experience. </p><p>Shamayleh told Poloff that she was approached by tribal </p><p>leaders who asked her to run.  Her tribe, numbering roughly </p><p>2,500, is too small to elect a member for a non-quota seat, </p><p>so the tribe used the women\'s quota as a means to secure </p><p>representation for its members in Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Shamayleh\'s example is not the only case where the </p><p>quota became part of a tribes\' election strategy.  Dr. Falak </p><p>Jamaani, from Madaba, is the daughter of a tribal sheikh. </p><p>During a July 1 meeting, she told Poloff that she would have </p><p>won far more votes on election day, but at mid-day, tribal </p><p>leaders told members entering polling stations not to vote </p><p>for Dr. Jamaani and instead vote for the tribe\'s other </p><p>candidate.  Their strategy?  To win two seats--one women </p><p>quota seat and one non-quota seat.  The strategy was </p><p>successful--now the tribe has two members seated in </p><p>Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While the women\'s quota was conceived to increase </p><p>women\'s representation in the political process, so far, it </p><p>has been shown mostly to be an election tool of the East Bank </p><p>tribes.  If Shamayleh is any example, women Parliamentarians </p><p>are likely to be primarily stronger advocates for their tribe </p><p>than their gender. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
