<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006157 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, XA, ZF, XW, CF, JO, SU, LY </p><p>SUBJECT: KING ABDULLAH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFO ON DROC </p><p>PRESIDENT KABILA\'S VISIT TO JORDAN; QADDAFI\'S "MEDDLING" IN </p><p>SUDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6073 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Congo/Kabila Visit </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) During an October 19 dinner with visiting NEA A/S </p><p>Burns, King Abdullah again raised the September 16-18 visit </p><p>to Jordan of DROC President Joseph Kabila.  The King said </p><p>"Kabila came to see me mostly about how to create a channel </p><p>to the British but also to the Americans."  The King said he </p><p>had conveyed this request to the British who sent a message </p><p>back that said \'this may be the right time to open up on the </p><p>Congo.\' The King said he noted to Kabila that Congo faced a </p><p>number of internal problems that might cause the US/UK </p><p>difficulties in reestablishing relations.  Kabila, according </p><p>to the King, replied: "I know what my problems are, but I </p><p>need a dialogue." </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Qaddafi/Sudan </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Later in the dinner, the King noted that "someone came </p><p>to me just today from Qaddafi, wanting to talk about the </p><p>Sudan.  I got the feeling Qaddafi wants to meddle in this." </p><p>The King said he felt the best chance is in Sudan\'s "honest </p><p>dialogue with the U.S.."  The King went on to say "we have </p><p>purposefully not seen Qaddafi recently, even though he called </p><p>at the time of the UNGA."  The King doubted that anything </p><p>would come of the previous Libyan offers of assistance, </p><p>especially on the Disi (water) project. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) A/S Burns cleared this message. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
