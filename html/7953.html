<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 003059 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP (GGLASS) S/CT, EUR/SE AND EUR/WE </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL (DAUFHAUSER), OFAC DIRECTOR </p><p>(NEWCOMB), AND TREASURY TASK FORCE FOR TERRORIST FINANCING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PTER, PREL, CVIS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: TURKISH REACTION TO BATASUNA </p><p>DESIGNATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 118179 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On May 9, MFA Deputy DG for intelligence and </p><p>research Hakan Okcal told us the MFA had circulated </p><p>interagency reftel information about additional names </p><p>affiliated with ETA (Batasuna, Euskal Herritarrock and Herri </p><p>Batasuna).  If GOT agencies found assets owned or controlled </p><p>by these additional entities, they would blocked such assets </p><p>using administrative means, he said.  The GOT would not be </p><p>able to formally designate these names on its terrorist </p><p>finance freeze list, Okcal explained, because the GOT only </p><p>designates names that are on the consolidated list of the UN </p><p>sanctions committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Okcal said Batusuna was well known in Turkey </p><p>because Turks see parallels between ETA/Batasuna and </p><p>KADEK/HADEP - both are political wings of terrorist groups, </p><p>he claimed.  He hastened to add that the GOT doesn\'t expect </p><p>the designation of Batasuna to lead to similiar action on </p><p>HADEP; rather he said he was characterizing private views of </p><p>some Turks on the KADEK/HADEP connection. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
