<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 000745 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/PD; EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, OPRC, ASEC, PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  ANTI-U.S. E-MAIL CAMPAIGN IN WAKE OF MEDIA </p><p>SMEAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:A) STATE 23898, B) ANKARA 704, C) ANKARA 618, D) </p><p>ANKARA 549 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. In the wake of recent anti-American stories in the </p><p>Turkish press (RefTels), Embassy has received, via the </p><p>Embassy web-site, a substantial number of e-mails </p><p>claiming that the Ambassador and other U.S. officials </p><p>are "no longer welcome" in Turkey.  To date, the </p><p>Embassy has received around 200 identical letters that </p><p>are clearly part of an organized campaign to stir anti- </p><p>American sentiment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Embassy translation of the letter follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Letter to the Ambassador: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Pearson, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As a citizen of the Republic of Turkey, I have been </p><p>observing recent events toward war in the Middle East </p><p>with an increasing level of worry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It has become obvious to almost every sensible citizen </p><p>on the planet that the group that has usurped power in </p><p>your country has made up its mind to change the rules, </p><p>the map, and the dynamics of the world on a large </p><p>scale.  It is also becoming clearer each day that my </p><p>country has a central place in the grand plan of this </p><p>team, whether it be as a means or an end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Following the tragic events of September 11, your </p><p>country has proven that despite its enormous resources, </p><p>it is incapable of leading the world towards a better </p><p>future both intellectually and spiritually.  It would </p><p>not surprise us that, as an American, your grasp of </p><p>world history, culture, and geography has limitations. </p><p>But I would like to remind you that my country bears </p><p>dynamics beyond your comprehension which will make it </p><p>impossible for you to realize your plans - whether it </p><p>be your plan A, plan B, or plan Z. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I am a part of that dynamic! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hereby, as an owner of this land, this history, </p><p>culture, and geography, I warn you that you are trying </p><p>to buy the land from the wrong owners.  Any politician, </p><p>bureaucrat, or institution which allows you to set foot </p><p>on this soil with your men and machinery has by default </p><p>foregone his right to this country, thereby putting you </p><p>in the awkward position of buying from the unlawful </p><p>owner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I am sorry to inform you that my country is not for </p><p>sale or rent.  It has become obvious that the power of </p><p>words has failed to convince you to change your </p><p>manners, which is doomed to put the whole region into </p><p>the fire.  We will stop the talk and do the walk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>From now on, you and your men are not welcome in my </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Please don\'t take our hospitality for granted.  We have </p><p>other characteristics as a nation which certainly you </p><p>should get a better grasp of. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End translation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The letter is being distributed widely throughout </p><p>Ankara via e-mail, with a message encouraging </p><p>recipients to forward it to the embassy web-site.  As </p><p>part of the message, recipients are encouraged to </p><p>attach a red and white ribbon to their cars as a sign </p><p>of protest against "the deployment of foreign troops on </p><p>Turkish soil and a war that targets Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
