<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 000908 </p><p> </p><p>D FOR BARRY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, SY, LE </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: LEBANESE SPEAKER BERRI DISCUSSES SHI\'ITE </p><p>RESPONSE TO WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) BEIRUT 896 (B) BEIRUT 899 (C) STATE 77620 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT M. BATTLE; REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR MET WITH LEBANESE PARLIAMENT </p><p>SPEAKER NABIH BERRI MARCH 31.  DISCUSSIONS CENTERED AROUND </p><p>AMERICAN-LEBANESE RELATIONS, THE WAR IN IRAQ AND SHI\'ITE </p><p>REACTION TO THE COALITION\'S CAMPAIGN, THE ROADMAP, AND USG </p><p>WARNINGS TO SYRIA REGARDING TRANSSHIPMENTS TO IRAQ.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  MEETING WITH SPEAKER BERRI MARCH 31, AMBASSADOR </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON (GOL) ACTORS </p><p>TO RECOGNIZE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANTI-WAR AND </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN RHETORIC IN MAKING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE WAR, AS </p><p>HE HAD PREVIOUSLY WITH OTHER GOL LEADERS (REFS A AND B). </p><p>BERRI RESPONDED POSITIVELY -- "I AM WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED </p><p>PERCENT" CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED STRONG </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS, HE SAID, ADDING THAT HE HAD TOLD THE </p><p>BRITISH AMBASSADOR THE SAME THING EARLIER THAT MORNING. </p><p>HOWEVER, BERRI CONTINUED, THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE ACCEPT OR </p><p>EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>"THANKS TO YOU, SADDAM IS A HERO" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  AMBASSADOR ASKED THE SPEAKER WHY ANTI-WAR SENTIMENT </p><p>COULD BE SO EASILY TRANSLATED INTO SUPPORT FOR SADDAM, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AMONG SHI\'ITES, GIVEN THE IRAQI REGIME\'S HISTORY </p><p>OF ATROCITIES AND REPRESSION AGAINST ITS OWN SHI\'A </p><p>POPULATION.  BERRI RESPONDED "NO WAY, WE ARE WITH THE IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE," NOT SADDAM, ADDING THAT SHI\'ITE PARTICIPANTS IN </p><p>ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS IN LEBANON HAVE REFUSED TO CARRY </p><p>PICTURES OF SADDAM.  AMBASSADOR PRESSED THE SPEAKER TO </p><p>EXPLAIN WHY LEBANESE SHI\'ITES ARE BOARDING BUSES TO IRAQ AS </p><p>VOLUNTEER FIGHTERS ON THE SIDE OF SADDAM.  BERRI EMPHATICALLY </p><p>DENIED THAT ANY AMAL SUPPORTERS WERE AMONG THIS GROUP, BUT </p><p>DID ACCEDE THAT HE CANNOT SPEAK FOR ALL SHI\'ITES (READ </p><p>HIZBALLAH).  TO EXPLAIN ARAB ANTI-WAR FEELINGS TURNING </p><p>PRO-SADDAM -- THE SPEAKER OFFERED THAT "YOU ARE MAKING HIM A </p><p>HERO."  AS FOR THE SHI\'ITES IN SOUTHERN IRAQ, BERRI </p><p>CONTINUED, THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WOULD WELCOME COALITION </p><p>FORCES AS LIBERATORS AND FIGHT ALONG SIDE THEM BELIES RECENT </p><p>HISTORY.  FOLLOWING DESERT STORM, THE U.S. HAD TURNED A BLIND </p><p>EYE TO THE REPUBLICAN GUARD MASSACRE OF IRAQI SHI\'ITES WHO </p><p>REBELLED AGAINST SADDAM. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ IS A PENCIL, ISRAEL A CANNON </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  BERRI REITERATED THE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED </p><p>BELIEF IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL REGIONAL ISSUE </p><p>IS THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT, NOT IRAQ.  "IRAQ IS A </p><p>PENCIL, ISRAEL A CANNON" SAID BERRI, IN REFERENCE TO THE SIZE </p><p>OF THE PROBLEM.  ARABS CANNOT SUPPORT U.S. ACTION IN IRAQ </p><p>WHEN THE U.S. LISTENS ONLY TO THE ISRAELIS AND NOT TO ITS </p><p>ARAB FRIENDS.  YOU CANNOT EXPECT THE ARAB WORLD TO ACCEPT </p><p>AMERICA AS THE JUDGE OF THE IRAQI REGIME, THE SPEAKER </p><p>CONTINUED, WHEN THE U.S. IGNORES THE INJUSTICES IN PALESTINE. </p><p> AS FOR THE ROADMAP, BERRI COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH ARAFAT HAS </p><p>AGREED TO THE CHANGED CONSTITUTION AND ABU MAZEN HAS AGREED </p><p>TO BE PRIME MINISTER, "STILL, SHARON WILL NEVER ACCEPT IT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)   BERRI RAISED SECRETARY RUMSFELD\'S WARNING TO SYRIA </p><p>ON TRANSSHIPMENTS OF MILITARY MATERIAL TO IRAQ.  HE OPINED </p><p>THAT THE SECRETARY WAS ATTEMPTING TO DEFLECT BLAME FOR THE </p><p>CURRENT COURSE OF THE WAR IN IRAQ.  AMBASSADOR ASSURED THE </p><p>SPEAKER THAT, TO THE CONTRARY, THE USG HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A </p><p>LONG AND INTENSE DIALOGUE WITH SYRIA THAT PRECEDES THE </p><p>COMMENCEMENT OF HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ.  THE SPEAKER REMAINED </p><p>UNCONVINCED, ADVISING THAT, GIVEN ITS POWER AND IMPORTANCE IN </p><p>THE WORLD, "THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT GO AROUND ACCUSING </p><p>SMALLER NATIONS OF THINGS UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  COMMENT:  BERRI EXPRESSED VIEWS WHICH PARALLEL HIS </p><p>RECENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS.  IN RESPONSE TO SECRETARY </p><p>RUMFIELD\'S WARNING TO SYRIA, BERRI STATED MARCH 29 "THE REAL </p><p>SMUGGLING ACTIVITIES TAKE PLACE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION, </p><p>FROM ISRAEL TO THE UNITED STATES -- ISRAEL IS SMUGGLING IDEAS </p><p>THAT EMBROIL THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION IN IRAQ."  BERRI </p><p>DISCUSSED WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE A FAILURE ON THE PART OF </p><p>ARABS TO EMPLOY ARAB CAPITAL PRESENT IN THE U.S. TO INFLUENCE </p><p>WASHINGTON, ADDING "I JUST HOPE I LIVE TO SEE THE DAY WHEN </p><p>THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WAKE UP FROM ISRAELI PROPAGANDA."  THE </p><p>SPEAKER WAS UPBEAT, HOWEVER, ABOUT THE FUTURE OF </p><p>U.S.-LEBANESE RELATIONS.  HE SEEMED QUITE GENUINE IN HIS LACK </p><p>OF ANIMOSITY AS HE REFLECTED ON WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE </p><p>CONSECUTIVE AMERICAN MISTAKES LEADING TO THE CURRENT STATE OF </p><p>U.S.-ARAB RELATIONS AS WELL AS THE COURSE OF THE WAR IN IRAQ. </p><p> END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BATTLE </p><p></p></div>
