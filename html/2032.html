<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002520 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/PD, IIP/G/AF </p><p>LAGOS FOR PAS, POL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OIIP, SCUL, PREL, PROP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE TERROR ATTACKS AND U.S. POLICY IN THE </p><p>NIGERIAN MEDIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  This cable provides a thumbnail summary of </p><p>trends in the Nigerian media since the terror attacks on </p><p>New York and Washington on September 11.  On the whole, </p><p>Nigerians were as shocked by the attacks as Americans.  The </p><p>media accurately reported the story and the immediate </p><p>condemnations of the terror attacks by Nigerian leaders. </p><p>They reported that there were also Nigerian casualties. </p><p>Media and commentators in the south have tended to be very </p><p>supportive of the U.S.  While also indicting the terrorism, </p><p>media in the north have urged restraint and caution, and </p><p>they have demanded proof that Osama bin Laden authored the </p><p>attacks.  North or south, there has been a generous amount </p><p>of "yes, but" commentary.  (Yes, we condemn the attacks, </p><p>but the U.S. must change its policies.)  In recent days, </p><p>some northern newspapers have begun to include anti-Semitic </p><p>propaganda.  The first column outrightly supporting the </p><p>Taliban and Osama Bin Laden also has appeared.

The news story of the attacks on New York and </p><p>Washington was so overwhelming that it took up to 2/3 of </p><p>the domestic TV news for several days.  Nigerians know what </p><p>happened, and they are keen to learn what the U.S. response </p><p>will be. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The newspapers gave generous ink to the big story, with </p><p>many running sensational front page color photos each day </p><p>during the first two weeks after the attacks.    Several </p><p>leading dailies continue to fill 2-6 inside pages daily </p><p>with news related to terrorism, the U.S. response, and the </p><p>results of the investigations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  More or less sound stories have, however, often been </p><p>preceded by inaccurate, yellow journalism headlines that </p><p>would make William Randolph Hearst proud.  In the </p><p>headlines, the war tocsins are sounding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The media gave full coverage when Nigeria\'s government </p><p>and the nation\'s political, religious, and social leaders, </p><p>north and south, Chrisian and Muslim, expressed their </p><p>condemnation of the attacks.  The Embassy has reported that </p><p>the early reports of jubilation in Zamfara State were </p><p>baseless -- an unverified report by a rookie BBC stringer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Most of the news coverage has come from the </p><p>international wires, and from the international papers and </p><p>newsmagazines (summary articles, "culled from ---" in the </p><p>local argot).  The use of the international wires is good </p><p>news for the maturing of journalism in Nigeria, but it </p><p>initially depressed PAS placements.  We are putting out </p><p>half a dozen Washington File articles a day to 20 major </p><p>newspapers -- but for the first two weeks after the attacks </p><p>we had barely half a dozen direct placements.  Editors are </p><p>relying on the wires to report U.S. policy, not the </p><p>Embassy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Nigerians have also gotten the message that non- </p><p>Americans were killed in the attacks.  Nigerians know that </p><p>compatriots are among the victims, but because many of </p><p>these victims were illegally in the U.S., using false </p><p>names, the specific number and identities of Nigeria\'s </p><p>losses are unknown. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Serious reportage and commentary shares the pages with </p><p>lighter fare.  Many articles have explained to readers how </p><p>the attacks were predicted by ... Nostradamus ... the Bible </p><p>... the Blessed Mother ... the Koran ... and/or various </p><p>contemporary prophets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>South and North </p><p>--------------- </p><p>9.  It must be recalled at all times that the media in </p><p>Nigeria reflect the ethnic and religious diversity of the </p><p>country.  Also, the attacks on the U.S. occurred just as </p><p>Nigeria was undergoing a cycle of social/ethnic/religious </p><p>tension.  Our best estimate is that 2300 people died in the </p><p>violence in Jos, which began four days before the attacks. </p><p>This no doubt colors individual Nigerian perceptions of the </p><p>terrorist attacks and the possible U.S. response thereto. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Some regional differences in the amount of coverage </p><p>are evident.  Most of the major newspapers in Lagos covered </p><p>the story with eye-catching photos and headlines, with </p><p>several inside pages developing the story along different </p><p>lines.  Their pages included dozens of columns, mostly </p><p>expressing sympathy for the U.S.  In many of the Lagos </p><p>papers, there is an undertone of "we\'ve been telling you </p><p>so" about religious extremists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  The state government-owned newspapers in Nigeria\'s </p><p>largely Muslim north -- the Triumph in Kano, the New </p><p>Nigerian in Kaduna, the Path in Sokoto -- have given the </p><p>story conspicuously less news coverage.  Columns initially </p><p>emphasized the need for American restraint, asked for clear </p><p>proof of Osama bin Laden\'s involvement, and advised against </p><p>a hasty U.S. response.  As the shock of the initial attacks </p><p>wears off, however, a few northern columnists are voicing </p><p>harsher criticisms of the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  South or north, however, it would be wrong to say that </p><p>Nigerian news has been crowded out.  The news of the </p><p>attacks and the U.S. response competes for reader attention </p><p>with the normal, contentious political news of the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Focus on the Critics </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>13.  Most editorial comment and most columnists -- south </p><p>and north -- fall into the "yes, but" category.  Yes, the </p><p>attacks have been a terrible tragedy for the U.S. and the </p><p>world.  Yes, we condemn the perpetrators.  But ... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... the United States has been humbled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... the United States, all now can see, is not as powerful </p><p>as its image. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... the United States is rushing to judgment against Osama </p><p>bin Laden when there is no real proof of his involvement, </p><p>violating its own democratic precept that one is innocent </p><p>until proven guilty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... the attacks expressed in a terrible way ... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... how much the U.S. is hated for its unilateralism </p><p>and its arrogance in international affairs, or </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... how some have reacted to America\'s one-sided </p><p>support of Israel and its sanction of Israeli violence </p><p>against the Palestinians, or </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... how America deserves punishment for being the </p><p>world\'s worst terrorist (either by act or by silence), in </p><p>the Gulf War, in Sudan, against the Iraqi people, against </p><p>the Palestinians, etc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The United States should not rush to judgment against Osama </p><p>bin Laden.  Remember that the Oklahoma city bombing was </p><p>carried out by an American.  Remember that one of those </p><p>tried for the Lockerbie bombing was found innocent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The United States cannot act ... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... unless it gives the world conclusive proof that bin </p><p>Laden ordered the attacks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... if any innocents will be harmed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The killings, assaults, mosque bombings, burnings of </p><p>businesses and homes, and racial profiling of Muslims in </p><p>the United States are shameful indications of deep American </p><p>hostility toward Islam. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The attacks are a consequence of the rich curtain of </p><p>dishonesty in the 2000 American election, which put George </p><p>Bush in the White House even though he had not been elected </p><p>by the majority of the people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theories </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>14.  Newspapers over the weekend included some new </p><p>conspiracy theories pointing the finger toward Israel and </p><p>the Jews as the true perpetrators of the attack.  The </p><p>independent Weekly Trust -- citing Jordan\'s Al-Watah -- </p><p>reported that 4000 Israelis, tipped off by the Israeli </p><p>government, stayed away from work on September 11.  The </p><p>tabloid News Express, reporting the same story, simply said </p><p>4000 Jews stayed home.  It also reported conspiratorily </p><p>that "the 14 story adjoining edifice to the WTC-owned by </p><p>the well known Jewish firm of Solomon & Co. was sold off </p><p>suddenly about 2 weeks prior to the attack."  These </p><p>unfortunate stories indicate that a minority of Nigerian </p><p>journalists are tuned in to criticisms of the U.S. </p><p>emanating from the Middle East and journalistic sources </p><p>there.  We may need to consider how OIIP can counter this </p><p>kind of disinformation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The First Expression of Support for Bin Laden </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>15.  In its Sunday edition the independent Weekly Trust, </p><p>published in Abuja, printed a "Friday discourse" by Dr. </p><p>Aliyu Tilde.  It is, to our knowledge, the first outright </p><p>expression of support for Bin Laden.  "While we sympathize </p><p>with all nations and families that lost their members in </p><p>the WTC attack and hope that actual truth behind it will </p><p>one day be discovered, we have chosen today to side with </p><p>the Taliban and pray for the safety of Bin Laden or his </p><p>martyrdom.  America has accused them unjustifiably." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  Tilde, an educator from Bauchi State, has been known </p><p>for many years as a strong critic of the West.  This column </p><p>is not yet on his web page, www.fridaydiscourse.com. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Visible Elite Opinion and </p><p>Village, Market, and Street Opinion </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>17.  The newspapers and the television tend to capture </p><p>elite opinion -- the views of those who speak and write </p><p>English and read newspapers.  The government and prominent </p><p>Nigerians who have spoken have roundly condemned the </p><p>attacks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  We believe, in this instance, elite opinion reflects </p><p>general public opinion.  Nonetheless, currents less </p><p>sympathetic to the U.S. are visible.  What reading and </p><p>listening can\'t tell us, however, is precisely how </p><p>widespread this negative reaction is at the popular level - </p><p>- in streets and markets.  Media coverage generally does </p><p>not reveal what the imam may say at Friday prayers, or the </p><p>deacon when speaking to fellow congregants.  They don\'t </p><p>offer much about how the attacks and American reaction may </p><p>affect the matrix of pre-existing social, ethnic, and </p><p>religious tensions in Nigeria.  The appearance of anti- </p><p>Semitic disinformation and a column in support of Bin Laden </p><p>may, or may not, be the first in-print expressions of a </p><p>more volatile, minority segment of public opinion that </p><p>lurked below the surface immediately after the attacks.  We </p><p>will be alert for further trends. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
