<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001081 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, EAID, ECON, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: BAUCHI: A STATE THAT WORKS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter visited Bauchi State from February </p><p>10-12, accompanied by USAID A/DIR Suggs and Pol/OFF Kinder. </p><p>In addition to private meetings with Governor Mu\'azu, the </p><p>Ambassador and his team visited several development projects </p><p>including the Yankari Game Reserve, paid a courtesy call on </p><p>the Emir, attended a state banquet and addressed the Bauchi </p><p>State Executive Council.  The Ambassador also visited four </p><p>local industries.  The trip was a success on two major </p><p>fronts:  First, it dispelled perceptions of USG indifference </p><p>toward Northern  Nigeria; secondly it enabled us to see </p><p>first-hand the accomplishments of a state that works. End </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Introduction </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU)  Ending a ten year hiatus since the last </p><p>Ambassadorial visit, Ambassador Jeter and Embassy staff </p><p>visited Bauchi February 10th.  While in Bauchi, the </p><p>Ambassador received a bird\'s eye view of the many </p><p>developmental projects being undertaken by the State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A State on the Move </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) The Bauchi State Government has implemented a number of </p><p>development projects aimed at reviving the state\'s agrarian </p><p>economy and improving the welfare of the State\'s poor.  Major </p><p>projects in the areas of rural road construction, village </p><p>electrification, primary and secondary health care, and </p><p>education are among the State\'s major accomplishments. </p><p>Progress on rural road and electrification projects was </p><p>evident as the team traveled far from Bauchi\'s capital. </p><p>While rural electrificaion is often rare in Nigeria and in </p><p>West Africa in general, over 100 of Bauchi\'s 200 villages </p><p>have electricity. The roads the team traveled were also in </p><p>extraordinarily good shape. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) The Mission group also visited the State Hospital.  The </p><p>hospital was attractive and well equipped. Some Nigerian </p><p>hospitals are well equipped, but lack adequately trained </p><p>staff to operate the equipment.  Governor Mu\'azu has avoided </p><p>this trap by using the lure of State pride and his personal </p><p>charisma to attract qualified medical personnel to Bauchi, </p><p>including professional indigenes of the State who have </p><p>returned from overseas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(U)  The team also visited one of the Bauchi\'s three new </p><p>model schools.  The schools were established to address an </p><p>abysmal record of academic achievement in the State\'s primary </p><p>and secondary schools.  According to Governor Mu\'azu, only </p><p>eight of the 8,000 students passed who sat for the Senior </p><p>Secondary School Certificate Examination in 1999. Soon </p><p>thereafter, the Governor began a program to revamp the entire </p><p>state school system. The model schools represent one step in </p><p>this process. The model schools enroll the state\'s "best and </p><p>brightest", in order to train and prepare the most gifted </p><p>students for future leadership positions within Bauchi and </p><p>throughout Nigeria.  The team visited the girls\' magnet </p><p>school where they were greeted by a lively school body.  What </p><p>the school lacked in facilities, the students made up with </p><p>enthusiasm. The Ambassador used this occasion to inform the </p><p>government of The Ambassador\'s Special Self- Help Program, </p><p>and suggested the school apply to the program to procure </p><p>reference books for its library. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Come To Bauchi </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(U) Bauchi projects itself as "the Pearl of Tourism". While </p><p>the sobriquet may be a bit hyperbolic, there is a grain of </p><p>truth to it. Showcasing Bauchi\'s tourist industry, senior </p><p>State government officials expertly served as tour guides to </p><p>Yankari Game Park.  The game park has been under federal </p><p>management since 1976.  According to Mu\'azu, the number of </p><p>visitors has declined during this period and the central </p><p>government has done precious little to halt this slide or to </p><p>maintain the facility. Governor Mu\'azu believes that the </p><p>state can do better and is attempting to regain control. He </p><p>claims to have potential investors prepared to finance </p><p>improvements, once the park is handed to the State </p><p>government.  Mu\'azu is optimistic that a radical facelift can </p><p>be achieved in two years. The State has already begun </p><p>modernizing guest accommodations, which when completed will </p><p>offer a much more attractive and comfortable option for </p><p>tourists.  The park has much potential, with over 50 species </p><p>of wild animals and a plethora of wild birds.  While it will </p><p>never rival the parks of Southern and Eastern Africa, </p><p>Yankari\'s potential to attract domestic and regional tourists </p><p>is large. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Putting the People to Work </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(U) Visiting four local business ventures, the Embassy </p><p>group was able to see the challenges to Bauchi\'s development </p><p>but also the state\'s potential, particularly in </p><p>agro-industry. </p><p>8.(U) The Bauchi meat processing plant has received a TDA </p><p>grant to conduct a feasibility study on the steps needed to </p><p>modernize the facility and bring it to full production.  The </p><p>cattle industry is an important sector of Bauchi\'s economy, </p><p>yet the plant is barely functioning, processing less than a </p><p>score of cattle each day. A/DIR Suggs raised the possibility </p><p>of using USAID\'s Farmer-to-Farmer program to bring </p><p>consultants to advise on management of the plant.  The </p><p>current facilities are sound but much of the equipment, while </p><p>serviceable, is outdated.  Once the study is complete and the </p><p>plant is retooled, the marriage of cattle-rearing and </p><p>industry should be a good one.  Revival of the meat </p><p>processing plant will open significant export opportunities </p><p>for Bauchi, including halal meat exports to traditional </p><p>markets in North Africa and perhaps the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(U) The Bauchi Fertilizer Blending Company is another </p><p>industry not yet meeting its full potential. Prior to </p><p>Governor Mu\'azu taking office, fertilizer was distributed </p><p>based on personal loyalties rather than utility or </p><p>maximization of output. As a result, the company fell </p><p>dormant.  Noting that much of Bauchi\'s future lay in </p><p>agriculture, the Governor arranged a N2.5 million soft loan </p><p>for the company, which returned to operation during his first </p><p>year in office. Morover, the governor has recently renewed </p><p>subsidies to state farmers and established other controls to </p><p>ensure equitable distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(U) The Ambassador also visited the Ramadan printing </p><p>company.  The company was fully operable, with every </p><p>available space filled with functioning equipment and busy </p><p>employees.  The quality of the work was high.  Although it </p><p>was February, the company was busy preparing 2002 calendars. </p><p>There is no way of knowing if the printer was behind or if </p><p>the orders came in late.  The printers, however, showed that </p><p>they can move quickly by producing a booklet of the Embassy\'s </p><p>visit prior to departure on February 12. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(U) The last industry visited was Alind Nigeria,Ltd., </p><p>makers of cable and conductors.  This company received a loan </p><p>of N3.5 million from the Bauchi State Government.  The </p><p>company\'s physical plant was fairly modern; however, it </p><p>seemed poorly staffed and appeared to be at partial </p><p>production. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Governor Mu\'azu--Trying Hard </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(SBU) Governor Mu\'azu is the main force behind this </p><p>activity.  A self-made, wealthy businessman, Mu\'azu has a </p><p>nationwide reputation as a hard worker.   This was evident </p><p>when he returned to work for several hours after the State </p><p>banquet he hosted for Ambassador Jeter, which lasted until </p><p>11pm.  The Governor also has a reputation for fairness--only </p><p>awarding contracts to companies with proven records, rather </p><p>than using contracts to curry political favors.  Mu\'azu has </p><p>also surrounded himself with a progressive, well-educated and </p><p>dedicated State Council.  The only woman on the Council, an </p><p>activist Muslim, spoke out forcefully on the need for more </p><p>female representation on the Executive Council and gently </p><p>chided Governor Mu\'azu for not doing more to make this </p><p>happen.  State workers are paid on time and Mu\'azu has also </p><p>repaid much of the salary arrears due civil servants from </p><p>previous administrations. A member of the PDP, Mu\'azu </p><p>campaigned hard for President Obasanjo during the last </p><p>election and helped him carry the Northeast.  He believes </p><p>that President Obasanjo can win the 2003 election, but must </p><p>recover from the mistakes he has made handling recent crises, </p><p>particularly the explosions in Lagos. Young, intelligent and </p><p>personable Mu\'azu is frequently mentioned as a potential </p><p>presidential candidate for 2007 and beyond. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(U) With corruption, violence, and a basic lack of </p><p>infrastructure prevalent in too many areas throughout </p><p>Nigeria, the trip to Bauchi state was a welcome change. We </p><p>were able to see many examples of how State and Local </p><p>government in Nigeria can be a catalyst to make things work </p><p>if the requisite political will is present.  No doubt there </p><p>remains much to do in Bauchi; however, important first steps </p><p>have been taken on what will be a long path to real </p><p>development.  Mu\'azu is proud of these achievements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.(SBU) The Ambassador was able to encourage the Governor </p><p>and his Council to continue their hard work, and offered to </p><p>assist where possible.  In the final analysis this trip </p><p>helped to eliminate the perception that the USG is </p><p>disinterested in Bauchi, and more generally the North. </p><p>Moreover, the trip was helpful in reinforcing our growing </p><p>perception that development is more likely to occur when </p><p>initiated at the local and state levels in Nigeria, </p><p>particularly when there is good governance,honest leadership </p><p>and public-private partnership. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
