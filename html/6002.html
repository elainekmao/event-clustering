SECSTATE 43684 </p><p>     B. 02 ROME 844 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  MISSION ITALY RECOMMENDS THAT ITALY REMAIN ON </p><p>THE 301 WATCH LIST. OVERALL FREQUENCY OF COPYRIGHT PIRACY HAS </p><p>LEVELED OFF OR FALLEN SLIGHTLY SINCE 2000, WHEN ITALY\'S NEW </p><p>COPYRIGHT LAW WAS ENACTED.  NONETHELESS, TOTAL LOSSES DUE TO </p><p>PIRACY ARE MOUNTING AND ITALY\'S PIRACY AND COUNTERFEITING </p><p>RATES REMAIN AMONG THE HIGHEST IN WESTERN EUROPE.  LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT IN SOME CITIES IS AGGRESSIVE. OFTEN, HOWEVER, </p><p>THEY ARE OUTPACED BY ORGANIZED CRIME NETWORKS THAT USE NEW </p><p>COPYING AND COUNTERFEITING TECHNOLOGIES AND DISTRIBUTION </p><p>MODALITIES TO EVADE THE LAW. TENACIOUS PROBLEMS REMAIN </p><p>REGARDING THE JUDICIARY, CERTAIN MUNICIPAL LEADERS, AND THE </p><p>SIAE (ITALY\'S COPYRIGHT ROYALTY COLLECTION AGENCY). </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE IPR SITUATION IN ITALY IMPROVED ONLY SLIGHTLY IN </p><p>2002, WITH PIRACY LEVELS REMAINING THE SAME IN MOST SECTORS </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ALLIANCE </p><p>(IIPA).  THE ENACTMENT OF THE 2000 COPYRIGHT LAW IN SEPTEMBER </p><p>2001 RAISED CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND LED TO INCREASED AWARENESS </p><p>AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND THE PUBLIC THAT PIRACY IS </p><p>A CRIME.  2002 HAS BEEN AMONG THE BEST YEARS FOR PIRACY </p><p>ENFORCEMENT IN ITALY.  FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED </p><p>AND 2 MILLION CDS WERE SEIZED.  HOWEVER, MOST OF THOSE </p><p>ARRESTED WERE IMMEDIATELY RELEASED.  ALMOST ALL OF THOSE </p><p>SENTENCED RECEIVED NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AND SERVED NO TIME </p><p>IN JAIL.  OF MANY RECENT RAIDS, ONE IN NOVEMBER 2002 SHUT </p><p>DOWN AN INTERNET PIRACY RING WITH REVENUES OF 60 MILLION USD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00834  01 OF 02  280639Z </p><p>PER YEAR.  THE RING WAS PIRATING A LARGE VARIETY OF ITEMS </p><p>SUCH AS CAD SOFTWARE WITH A RETAIL VALUE OF 20,000 USD PER </p><p>TITLE.  MORE ARRESTS HAVE STEMMED CERTAIN FORMS OF PIRACY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN CITIES WHERE THE MAYORS AND PREFECTS SUPPORT </p><p>POLICE EFFORTS.  BUT PIRATES ARE ALSO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>NEW, MORE DISPERSED DUPLICATION TECHNOLOGIES AND DISTRIBUTION </p><p>NETWORKS WHICH ARE LESS VULNERABLE TO POLICE SEIZURES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ENFORCEMENT VARIES FROM CITY TO CITY, DEPENDING UPON </p><p>MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE MAYOR AND PREFECT IN </p><p>ROME HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO ALLOW POLICE TO ACT AGAINST </p><p>STREET VENDORS OF PIRATED MATERIAL.  AS A RESULT, SUCH STREET </p><p>SALES HAVE CONTINUED UNIMPEDED.  OFFICIALS IN CERTAIN CITIES </p><p>HAVE ATTEMPTED TO STOP LOCAL CARABINIERI FROM ACTING.  ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, TRIESTE CITY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE. </p><p> AS A RESULT, IN THAT CITY, STREET VENDORS OF PIRATED </p><p>MATERIAL HAVE ALMOST DISAPPEARED AND PIRACY RATES ARE </p><p>EXTREMELY LOW. </p><p> </p><p>4.   PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES VARY IN QUALITY AS WELL.  MOST </p><p>PROSECUTORS ARE UNWILLING TO BRING CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST </p><p>STREET VENDORS, FACTORY WORKERS OR SHOP WORKERS.  JUDGES ARE </p><p>USUALLY UNWILLING TO CONVICT, ARGUING THAT "MINOR" ECONOMIC </p><p>CRIMES DO NOT JUSTIFY CRIMINAL TREATMENT. </p><p> </p><p>USE / PROCUREMENT OF GOVERNMENT SOFTWARE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE HAVE RECEIVED NO COMPLAINTS/INFORMATION REGARDING </p><p>GOVERNMENT USE OF PIRATED SOFTWARE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00834  01 OF 02  280639Z </p><p> </p><p>LEGISLATION </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  ITALY AMENDED THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS TO THE 2000 </p><p>COPYRIGHT LAW IN EARLY 2003 TO PERMIT ROUTINE EXEMPTIONS FROM </p><p>THE SIAE STICKER FOR BUSINESS SOFTWARE.  THE ITALIAN </p><p>PARLIAMENT APPROVED THE 2001 EU DIRECTIVES OMNIBUS BILL, </p><p>WHICH DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE GOI TO INTEGRATE EU RULES </p><p>GOVERNING COPYRIGHT INTO THE ITALIAN LEGAL CODE. IN 2002 THE </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT PASSED LEGISLATION, INITIATED BY THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY, WHICH CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF A DOZEN </p><p>NEW SPECIALIZED ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL IPR COURT SECTIONS, </p><p>ALLOCATES FIVE MILLION EURO TO THE MODERNIZATION OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, AND CLEARS THE WAY FOR </p><p>THE RATIONALIZATION OF ITALY\'S PATENT AND TRADEMARK LAW.  THE </p><p>COMING YEAR WILL TELL WHETHER THESE INITIATIVES WILL BE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>SIAE: WHERE DO THE COLLECTIONS GO? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

SO FAR, SIAE HAS </p><p>BEEN MORE AN OBSTACLE THAN AN ALLY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN ACCORD WITH ARTICLE 11 OF THE 2000 COPYRIGHT LAW, SIAE </p><p>IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANTI-PIRACY EFFORTS IN ITALY.  BECAUSE </p><p>SIAE RECEIVES ALL REVENUES FROM ITS STICKER, WHICH IS </p><p>REQUIRED FOR COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS UNDER THE LAW (WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF BUSINESS SOFTWARE), IT HAS ADEQUATE RESOURCES </p><p>FOR THESE EFFORTS.  HOWEVER, SIAE APPEARS TO DIRECT ITS </p><p>EFFORTS SOLELY AT INSPECTING LEGITIMATE COPYRIGHTED GOODS TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT THESE CARRY A SIAE STICKER. SIAE HAS DONE </p><p>NOTHING, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, TO ACT AGAINST ILLEGALLY PRODUCED </p><p>COPYRIGHTED GOODS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  INDUSTRY AND EMBASSY EFFORTS AT IPR EDUCATION AND </p><p>ENFORCEMENT, WHILE EXTENSIVE, ARE NOT ENOUGH.  OUR COMBINED </p><p>EFFORTS HAVE IMPROVED THE SITUATION, PARTICULARLY WITH LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT AND, IN SOME CASES, WITH THE JUDICIARY.  HOWEVER, </p><p>SIAE HAS THE NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE RESOURCES.  WE </p><p>HAVE PRESSED SIAE TO INVOLVE ITSELF IN EDUCATION AND </p><p>ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS, BUT HAVE SEEN NO ACTION YET. </p><p> </p><p>WIPO TREATIES </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  ITALY HAS NOT YET RATIFIED THE 1996 WIPO COPYRIGHT </p><p>TREATY NOR THE WIPO PERFORMANCE AND PHONOGRAMS TREATY. </p><p> </p><p>OPTICAL MEDIA PIRACY (CDS, VCDS, DVDS) </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00834  02 OF 02  280639Z </p><p>11.  OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE LEVEL OF PIRACY HAS REMAINED </p><p>ALMOST UNCHANGED, BUT THE METHOD OF PIRACY HAS CHANGED FROM </p><p>LARGER VENUES TO SMALL-SCALE OPERATIONS USING COMMERCIAL CD-R </p><p>BURNERS. PIRACY ACCOUNTS FOR AN ESTIMATED 23 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>OVERALL MARKET IN ITALY, AND 50 PERCENT IN THE SOUTH OF </p><p>ITALY.  BURNED DVDS ARE QUICKLY REPLACING PIRATED VIDEOS. THE </p><p>ESTIMATED LOSS TO THE U.S. MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY DUE TO </p><p>AUDIOVISUAL PIRACY IN ITALY IS ESTIMATED TO BE 140 MILLION </p><p>USD.  DVD PIRACY IS EXPECTED TO GROW IN 2003, REQUIRING </p><p>GREATER VIGILANCE BY THE POLICE AND DETERRENT SENTENCES BY </p><p>THE COURTS.  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE OFTEN EMPLOYED TO SELL </p><p>THE PIRATED GOODS ON STREET CORNERS THROUGHOUT ITALY.  THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN INCREASED MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE ISSUE, AND JUDGES </p><p>ARE BEGINNING TO HAND DOWN SERIOUS SENTENCES FOR PIRACY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE IIPA RECOMMENDS THAT ITALY REMAIN ON THE WATCH LIST. </p><p> IPR INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES HERE SHARE THAT ASSESSMENT.  WE </p><p>AGREE.  AS ITALY BEGINS TO IMPLEMENT ITS TOUGH COPYRIGHT LAW, </p><p>THE SITUATION IS IMPROVING, BUT MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE.  WE </p><p>NEED TO KEEP OUR MARKER DOWN AND VISIBLE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00834 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
