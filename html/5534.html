<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 09 USUN NEW YORK 000299 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PTER, UNSC, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: UNSC/IRAQ:  SECRETARY POWELL MAKES THE CASE; THE </p><p>COUNCIL DELIVERS PRELIMINARY RESPONSES </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SECRETARY POWELL MADE AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN </p><p>MINUTE-PRESENTATION FEBRUARY 5 TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>(SC) IN WHICH HE OUTLINED, IN DETAIL: IRAQI EFFORTS TO DEFEAT </p><p>UNMOVIC AND IAEA INSPECTIONS; IRAQ\'S FAILURE TO ACCOUNT FOR </p><p>WMD AND OTHER MATERIALS IT WAS KNOWN TO HAVE POSSESSED; AND </p><p>IRAQ\'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE AL-QAEDA TERRORIST NETWORK, WITH </p><p>PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE ACTIVITIES OF AL-QAEDA OPERATIVE </p><p>ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI.  USING A COMBINATION OF TRANSLATED </p><p>INTERCEPTS, SATELLITE IMAGERY, AND REPORTS FROM HUMAN </p><p>SOURCES, THE SECRETARY, FLANKED BY AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE AND </p><p>CIA DIRECTOR TENET, LAID OUT THE U.S. POSITION THAT UN </p><p>INSPECTIONS WERE NOT WORKING, AND COULD NOT SUCCEED, IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF ACTIVE IRAQI COOPERATION.  IN THE POST-SEPTEMBER </p><p>11 ENVIRONMENT, HE WARNED, THE USG COULD NOT EXPOSE ITS </p><p>CITIZENS TO THE KIND OF DANGERS POSED BY A NEXUS BETWEEN </p><p>IRAQI WMD AND TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL, HE </p><p>WARNED, HAD TO FACE UP TO THE CHALLENGES POSED BY IRAQI </p><p>NON-COMPLIANCE OR FACE "IRRELEVANCE."  REACTIONS FROM COUNCIL </p><p>MEMBERS WERE MUTED, IN PART BECAUSE THEY HAD HAD NO ADVANCE </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONTENTS OF THE SECRETARY\'S BRIEFING.  SOME </p><p>EXISTING FAULT LINES IN THE COUNCIL REMAINED CLEAR, WITH </p><p>CHINA, GERMANY, SYRIA, AND PAKISTAN ARGUING THAT MORE TIME </p><p>SHOULD BE ALLOTTED TO THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS.  SPAIN AND </p><p>CHILE EXPRESSED EXASPERATION WITH IRAQI NON-COMPLIANCE BUT </p><p>DID NOT GO AS FAR AS BULGARIA, WHICH DECLARED IRAQ IN </p><p>MATERIAL BREACH OF UNSCR 1441.  ANGOLA, CAMEROON, AND GUINEA </p><p>FIRMLY FENCE-STRADDLED WHILE FRANCE APPEARED TO EMBRACE ALL </p><p>OPTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY.  FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER DE VILLEPIN </p><p>MADE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STRENGTHENING THE </p><p>INSPECTIONS REGIME WHILE DEMANDING AT THE SAME TIME </p><p>"IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE" IRAQI COMPLIANCE WITH UN </p><p>INSPECTIONS.  IRAQI PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE AL-DOURI ROUNDLY </p><p>REJECTED THE ENTIRE U.S. PRESENTATION AND ALLEGED THAT ISRAEL </p><p>REPRESENTS THE "REAL WMD THREAT" IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL MAKES THE CASE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE SECRETARY BEGAN HIS DETAILED, ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN </p><p>MINUTE PRESENTATION BY FOCUSING ON IRAQ\'S EFFECTS TO DECEIVE </p><p>UN INSPECTORS.  HE PLAYED SEVERAL RADIO INTERCEPTS, DETAILING </p><p>EFFORTS BY IRAQI MILITARY OFFICERS TO HIDE ITEMS FROM </p><p>INSPECTORS.  HE OUTLINED THE SCALE OF GOI GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>EFFORTS TO MISLEAD INSPECTORS AND SHOWED SATELLITE PHOTOS </p><p>DETAILING IRAQI MILITARY ACTIVITY IN ADVANCE OF THE ARRIVAL </p><p>OF INSPECTORS.  HE ALSO DESCRIBED THE THREATS MADE BY THE GOI </p><p>TO IRAQI SCIENTISTS TO PRECLUDE THEIR COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE SECRETARY THEN GAVE A SENSE OF IRAQI WMD </p><p>STOCKPILES AND EXPLAINED WHY THEY WERE OF CONCERN: </p><p> </p><p>--  BIOLOGICAL:  IRAQ HAS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF </p><p>BIOLOGICAL AGENTS.  THE SECRETARY HELD UP A TEASPOON OF </p><p>ANTHRAX SIMULANT, DESCRIBED HOW AN EQUIVALENT QUANTITY MAILED </p><p>IN AN ENVELOPE HAD SHUT DOWN THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN </p><p>2001, AND NOTED THAT THE UNDECLARED IRAQI AMOUNTS EQUATED TO </p><p>TENS UPON TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TEASPOONFULS. THE SECRETARY </p><p>ALSO EXPLAINED IRAQI PROGRAMS TO MAKE THEIR BIOLOGICAL </p><p>PROGRAMS MOBILE, AND SHOWED CONCEPTUAL IMAGES OF IRAQI LABS </p><p>LOCATED ON ORDINARY TRUCKS AND TRAINS. </p><p> </p><p>-- CHEMICAL:  THE SECRETARY PROVIDED A SENSE OF HOW MANY </p><p>IRAQI CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE MISSING, CITING THE NUMBER USED </p><p>IN THE PRESIDENT\'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AND RECENT USG </p><p>STATEMENTS. HE EXPLAINED THAT IRAQ HAD SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED </p><p>ITS DUAL-USE FACTORIES TO WITHSTAND INSPECTION, WHICH MEANT </p><p>THAT IRAQI CW PRODUCTION DID NOT HAVE TO BE MOBILE.  THE </p><p>SECRETARY DISPLAYED SATELLITE IMAGERY OF AN IRAQI CW </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT AREA THAT HAD BEEN BULLDOZED AND DENUDED OF </p><p>TOPSOIL TO ENSURE THAT INSPECTORS DID NOT DETECT ANY CW </p><p>TRACES IN THE SOIL.  HE PLAYED ANOTHER INTERCEPT OF IRAQI </p><p>MILITARY OFFICERS DISCUSSING NERVE AGENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- NUCLEAR:  THE SECRETARY DESCRIBED IRAQI MOVES TO KEEP </p><p>THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM ALIVE, SAYING THEY LACKED ONLY FISSILE </p><p>MATERIAL, HAVING MAINTAINED CADRES OF NUCLEAR SCIENTISTS AND </p><p>NUCLEAR BOMB DESIGNS.  HE DESCRIBED IRAQI NUCLEAR-RELATED </p><p>PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS ACQUISITION OF NUCLEAR TUBES, </p><p>BALANCING MACHINES, AND SPECIALIZED MAGNETS.  HE REMINDED THE </p><p>WORLD THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD UNDERESTIMATED THE </p><p>IRAQI NUCLEAR PROGRAM BEFORE AND CHALLENGED IT NOT TO DO SO </p><p>AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>--  DELIVERY SYSTEMS: THE SECRETARY EXPLAINED GOI WORK ON </p><p>BALLISTIC MISSILES AND UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES (UAVS).  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED IRAQI HOLDINGS OF AL-SAMOUD AND AL-FATAH MISSILES, </p><p>EXPLAINING THAT BOTH HAVE RANGES EXCEEDING UN LIMITS AND THAT </p><p>THEY ARE THEREFORE PROHIBITED.  HE NOTED IRAQI EFFORTS TO </p><p>ILLEGALLY IMPORT MISSILE COMPONENTS SUCH AS SA-2 ROCKET </p><p>ENGINES, AND TOLD THE COUNCIL THAT SOME HAD BEEN ACQUIRED </p><p>AFTER THE PASSAGE OF UNSCR 1441.  HE DESCRIBED THE IRAQI UAV </p><p>PROGRAMS, QUOTING EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF UAV DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>DEPLOYMENT, AND ABILITY  TO DISTRIBUTE BIOLOGICAL AND </p><p>CHEMICAL AGENTS.  HE DESCRIBED A RECENT IRAQI UAV FLIGHT THAT </p><p>STRETCHED FOR 500 KILOMETERS, VIOLATING UN RANGE LIMITS, AND </p><p>REMINDED THE COUNCIL THAT IRAQ HAD NOT PROVIDED UAV </p><p>INFORMATION IN ITS DECEMBER 7 DECLARATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) TURNING TO TERRORISM, THE SECRETARY DESCRIBED IRAQ\'S </p><p>LONG-STANDING TIES TO PALESTINIAN TERROR GROUPS.  HE NOTED </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS COMMITTED IN EUROPE BY THE IRAQI INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SERVICE.  THE SECRETARY DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IRAQ\'S LINKS WITH </p><p>AL-QAEDA OPERATIVE ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI, OUTLINING HIS </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN BAGHDAD, THE LACK OF IRAQI RESPONSE TO REQUESTS </p><p>FOR HIS DETENTION AND EXTRADITION, AND HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF U.S. DIPLOMAT LAURENCE FOLEY IN JORDAN IN </p><p>2002.  HE EXPLAINED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN AL-QAEDA AND </p><p>AL-ZARQAWI WITH TERRORIST ACTIONS IN THE UK, SPAIN, ITALY, </p><p>GERMANY, AND RUSSIA.   HE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL AL-QAEDA\'S </p><p>EFFORTS IN GAINING WMD ASSISTANCE FROM IRAQ, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>OBTAINING TRAINING IN THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF CHEMICAL AND </p><p>BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  THE SECRETARY CONCLUDED BY DESCRIBING IRAQ\'S </p><p>DEPLORABLE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD, INCLUDING ATROCITIES </p><p>COMMITTED AGAINST THE KURDS, SHIA, AND MARSH ARABS.  HE </p><p>REMINDED THE COUNCIL THAT SADDAM HAS ATTEMPTED TO INTIMIDATE </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS AND OF HIS DETERMINED </p><p>EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MORE WMD.  HE ASKED THE COUNCIL WHETHER </p><p>THE WORLD SHOULD TAKE THE RISK THAT IRAQ WOULD USE WMD IN A </p><p>TIME AND PLACE OF ITS CHOOSING, AT A FUTURE POINT WHEN THE </p><p>WORLD WAS IN A MUCH WEAKER POSITION TO RESPOND TO IRAQI </p><p>ACTIONS.  HE DECLARED THAT THE U.S. WILL NOT AND CAN NOT RUN </p><p>SUCH A RISK, SAID IRAQ HAD PLACED ITSELF IN DEEPER MATERIAL </p><p>BREACH UNDER UNSCR 1441, AND CHALLENGED THE WORLD NOT TO </p><p>SHRINK FROM WHATEVER IS AHEAD OF IT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATEMENTS BY THE PERMANENT FIVE MEMBERS: </p><p> </p><p>FRANCE: WE DO NOT RULE OUT ANY OPTION </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER DE VILLEPIN SAID THE </p><p>SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION CONTAINED ELEMENTS OF INTEREST THAT </p><p>THE INSPECTORS SHOULD ASSESS.  IN RESPONSE TO THE SECRETARY\'S </p><p>INDICTMENT OF IRAQI NON-COOPERATION WITH UN INSPECTIONS, </p><p>VILLEPIN STRESSED THAT, BY ADOPTING UNSCR 1441, THE COUNCIL </p><p>HAD REAFFIRMED RELIANCE ON AN INSPECTIONS PROCESS, AND </p><p>ASSERTED THAT THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION PROVIDED FURTHER </p><p>JUSTIFICATION "TO THE COURSE OF THE UN" AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>INSPECTIONS.  HE ARGUED THAT, THROUGH THE INSPECTIONS REGIME, </p><p>RESULTS HAD BEEN ACHIEVED:  UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA WERE BOTH IN </p><p>IRAQ AT WORK, THERE HAS BEEN A MULTIPLICATION OF SITES </p><p>INSPECTED, AND THERE WERE MORE THAN 100 INSPECTORS ON THE </p><p>GROUND.  "GOOD PROGRESS" HAD BEEN ACHIEVED IN DEEPENING THE </p><p>IAEA\'S KNOWLEDGE OF IRAQI NUCLEAR CAPACITY, ACCORDING TO </p><p>EL-BARADEI, AND ACCORDING TO BLIX, THERE HAD BEEN NO TRACE OF </p><p>CBW MATERIALS IN THE TRACE SAMPLES TAKEN TO DATE.  BUT, </p><p>VILLEPIN SAID, "IRAQI COOPERATION CONTAINED GREY AREAS."  THE </p><p>JANUARY 27 BLIX REPORT CONTAINED EVIDENCE OF REAL PROBLEMS IN </p><p>THIS AREA. TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF COOPERATION, FRANCE </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO PASS INFORMATION TO FACILITATE THE </p><p>INSPECTIONS, HE ADDED.  THE ABSENCE OF LONG-RANGE DELIVERY </p><p>SYSTEMS HAS, TO DATE, LARGELY CONTAINED THE THREAT OF CBW, </p><p>BUT THERE WERE "DISTURBING INDICATIONS ABOUT ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>ACQUIRE SUCH SYSTEMS." HE ALSO STRESSED A NEED TO "KEEP AN </p><p>EYE ON" THE ALUMINUM TUBES ISSUE AND WHAT THEY MIGHT SIGNIFY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) THE COUNCIL AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST </p><p>DELIVER A DIFFICULT MESSAGE TO IRAQ, VILLEPIN STATED. THE USE </p><p>OF FORCE WAS THE FINAL RECOURSE, AND WHY GO TO WAR, HE ASKED, </p><p>IF THERE IS "UNUSED SPACE" IN UNSCR 1441?   VILLEPIN ARGUED </p><p>THAT THE COUNCIL MUST DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT THE "NATURE </p><p>AND SCOPE" OF IRAQI VIOLATIONS JUSTIFIED THE USE OF FORCE, </p><p>DECLARING "WE WILL NOT RULE OUT ANY OPTION, AS WE HAVE SAID </p><p>ALL ALONG." VILLEPIN MADE THE FOLLOWING KEY POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>--THE UN MUST BE AT THE CENTER OF THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE </p><p>TO IRAQ, AS A MEANS TO GUARANTEE THE UNITY OF IRAQ, ASSURE </p><p>REGIONAL STABILITY, PRESERVE INTERNATIONAL UNITY, AND PROTECT </p><p>CIVILIAN POPULATIONS; </p><p> </p><p>--THERE SHOULD BE "DECISIVE REINFORCEMENT OF THE MEANS OF </p><p>INSPECTIONS."  THIS WOULD INCLUDE INCREASING BY TWO TO THREE </p><p>TIMES THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS, ESTABLISHING SURVEILLANCE OF </p><p>SITES INSPECTED BY INTERNATIONAL FORCES, DEPLOYING AERIAL </p><p>SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT, AND CREATING A COORDINATING AND </p><p>PROCESSING CENTER FOR RELEVANT INTELLIGENCE; </p><p> </p><p>--WE SHOULD LIST AND "RANK" UNRESOLVED DISARMAMENT QUESTIONS; </p><p> </p><p>--THERE MUST BE REGULAR PROGRESS IN DISARMAMENT.  IT WOULD BE </p><p>USEFUL TO ESTABLISH A POSITION FOR A NEW DISARMAMENT </p><p>COORDINATOR IN BAGHDAD TO COORDINATE WITH BLIX AND </p><p>EL-BARADEI; </p><p> </p><p>--IRAQ MUST "IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLETELY" COMPLY BY AGREEING </p><p>TO U-2 FLIGHTS, ADOPTING A LEGAL PROHIBITION ON WMD, AND </p><p>HANDING OVER ALL PROBABLE INFORMATION ON CBW PROGRAMS; AND </p><p> </p><p>--BAGHDAD MUST ALSO NOW PROVIDE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS </p><p>RAISED BY SECRETARY POWELL\'S BRIEFING.  BY THE NEXT REPORT OF </p><p>THE INSPECTORS ON FEBRUARY 14, IRAQ MUST HAVE DEMONSTRATED </p><p>THAT IT IS PROVIDING CONCRETE SUPPORT AND COOPERATION. </p><p>FRANCE HAS A "MORAL AND POLITICAL DUTY TO DIRECT MORAL AND </p><p>POLITICAL ENERGY" TO ENSURE THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RUSSIA: NO CONCRETE TIME LIMITS TO 1441, </p><p>BUT IT\'S TIME FOR BAGHDAD TO GET THE MESSAGE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) FM IVANOV NOTED RUSSIA\'S DESIRE FOR A POLITICAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT TO THE IRAQ CRISIS AND CALLED ON IRAQ TO FULLY AND </p><p>UNCONDITIONALLY COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF UNSCR 1441. </p><p>HE STATED THAT GIVEN THE UNANIMOUS DESIRE OF THE COUNCIL TO </p><p>DEAL WITH WMD CONCERNS WORLD-WIDE, IT WAS IN THE INTEREST OF </p><p>ALL MEMBERS TO WORK TOGETHER THROUGH THE COUNCIL AND THE UN </p><p>TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL WAS SERIOUS AND REQUIRED THOROUGH STUDY BY MOSCOW. HE </p><p>ASKED THAT THIS INFORMATION ALSO BE HANDED OVER TO THE </p><p>INSPECTORS, IN ORDER TO ALLOW IRAQ AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND </p><p>TO THE QUESTIONS RAISED. IVANOV URGED THE COUNCIL TO DO </p><p>EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE </p><p>INSPECTORS--RUSSIA, HE NOTED, FOR ITS PART WAS READY TO </p><p>PROVIDE AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE PLANES AND ADDITIONAL </p><p>INSPECTORS AS NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  IVANOV STATED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR BAGHDAD TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THE SITUATION. HE POINTED </p><p>OUT "IRAQ SHOULD BE THE FIRST CONCERNED" WITH PROVIDING FINAL </p><p>CLARITY TO ACHIEVE A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT AND THAT THE END OF </p><p>SANCTIONS RESTED IN IRAQ\'S WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE.  HE ALSO </p><p>STATED THAT, ALTHOUGH HE HAS OFTEN HEARD THAT "TIME IS </p><p>RUNNING OUT" FOR IRAQ, THERE ARE NO CONCRETE TIME LIMITS </p><p>ATTACHED TO UNSCR 1441, AND THE COUNCIL SHOULD NOT RULE OUT </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE--OR MORE--RESOLUTIONS. IN CLOSING, </p><p>IVANOV OPINED THAT THE MORE SERIOUS CHALLENGE FACING THE </p><p>WORLD--INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM--WAS BEING DEALT WITH </p><p>EFFECTIVELY AS A RESULT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND </p><p>UNITY. HE URGED THE MEMBERS TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE IN THE </p><p>SAME MANNER. </p><p> </p><p>UK: IRAQ HAS FAILED THE TEST, </p><p>COUNCIL ON THE EDGE OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) UK FM STRAW WELCOMED THE POWERFUL AND AUTHORITATIVE </p><p>EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE U.S. AND STATED THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OWED THANKS TO SECRETARY POWELL FOR </p><p>ILLUSTRATING THE GRAVE DANGERS POSED BY IRAQ.  STRAW NOTED </p><p>THAT THE COUNCIL HAD GIVEN IRAQ ONE LAST CHANCE TO COMPLY </p><p>FULLY WITH ITS DISARMAMENT OBLIGATIONS IN UNSCR 1441--A </p><p>RESOLUTION TO WHICH SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD RESPONDED WITH THE </p><p>SAME CONTEMPT AS THE MANY RESOLUTIONS BEFORE IT. STRAW STATED </p><p>THAT IRAQ HAD VIOLATED BOTH "TESTS" SET FORTH IN OP 4 OF </p><p>1441--NAMELY THE OMISSION OF INFORMATION IN ITS DECLARATION, </p><p>AND ITS UNWILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE AND DISARM WILLINGLY, </p><p>INCLUDING ITS REFUSAL TO PERMIT U-2 FLIGHTS. STRAW DECLARED </p><p>THAT IRAQ\'S ACTION TO DATE COULD ONLY BE INTERPRETED AS </p><p>FURTHER MATERIAL BREACH AND,  WHILE THE UK DOES NOT WANT WAR, </p><p>HMG DOES WANT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE UN SYSTEM TO BE UPHELD. </p><p>STRAW NOTED THAT, WHILE SADDAM HUSSEIN AND THE GOI HAD </p><p>SERIOUS CHOICES TO MAKE, THE COUNCIL HAD A SERIOUS CHOICE AS </p><p>WELL. CITING THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE FAILURES OF THE </p><p>LEAGUE OF NATIONS, HE OBSERVED THAT THE COUNCIL WAS AT RISK </p><p>OF SLIPPING DOWN THE SAME SLOPE IF IT CHOSE INACTION.  WE OWE </p><p>IT TO HISTORY, HE SAID, NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>CHINA: AVOID WAR IF POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IS AT ALL POSSIBLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER TANG UNDERSCORED THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S DESIRE TO MAINTAIN COUNCIL UNITY </p><p>AND COOPERATION ON THE ISSUE OF IRAQ.  TANG NOTED THAT THE </p><p>U.S. INITIATIVE TO PROVIDE THE COUNCIL AND THE INSPECTORS </p><p>WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT OF </p><p>UNSCR 1441, AND HE URGED ALL OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW THE U.S. </p><p>EXAMPLE.  HE FURTHER NOTED THAT THE COUNCIL\'S UNITED GOAL TO </p><p>DISARM IRAQ WAS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF </p><p>UNSCR 1441, AND HE CALLED ON IRAQ TO ADHERE TO ITS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES TO FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>MEASURES CALLED FOR IN THAT RESOLUTION.  TANG ALSO STATED </p><p>THAT THE UNIVERSAL DESIRE FOR A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT SHOULD </p><p>BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE UN FRAMEWORK AND HE URGED THE </p><p>COUNCIL TO AVOID WAR IF A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT WAS EVEN </p><p>REMOTELY POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE ELECTED TEN MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL: </p><p> </p><p>GERMANY: VITAL TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE INSPECTIONS REGIME </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER FISCHER AFFIRMED THAT THE </p><p>UNSC SHOULD BE PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN DECISION MAKING ON </p><p>IRAQ.  THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION WARRANTED CAREFUL </p><p>EXAMINATION AND A QUICK AND CLEAR RESPONSE BY IRAQ.   FOR </p><p>INSPECTIONS TO BE BETTER TARGETED, DETAILED INFORMATION WAS </p><p>NECESSARY.  FISCHER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IRAQ HAS REPEATEDLY </p><p>FLOUTED UNSCRS OVER THE TWELVE-YEAR SPAN IN WHICH IT HAS </p><p>FIGURED ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA; HE SAID IRAQ WAS A BRUTAL </p><p>REGIME THAT HAD ATTACKED IRAN, KUWAIT, ISRAEL, AS WELL AS THE </p><p>KURDS, AND IT WAS THAT AGGRESSION THAT JUSTIFIED THE </p><p>IMPOSITION OF NO-FLY ZONES.  WHILE THE PRESENCE OF INSPECTORS </p><p>IN IRAQ HELPED CONTAIN THE DANGER, LASTING DISARMAMENT </p><p>REMAINED THE TRUE OBJECTIVE.  THE INSPECTIONS REQUIRED </p><p>GREATER REINFORCEMENT AND, ABOVE ALL, MORE TIME.  THE </p><p>UPCOMING TRIP OF BLIX AND EL-BARADEI TO BAGHDAD WAS A CRUCIAL </p><p>CHANCE FOR IRAQ TO DISPEL SUSPICIONS ABOUT THEIR PROGRAMS AND </p><p>CAPACITIES.  WARNING AGAINST THE "CLEAR DANGERS" OF MILITARY </p><p>ACTION, FISCHER CALLED FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE </p><p>CRISIS WITHIN THE UN FRAMEWORK. IT WAS VITAL TO EXPAND AND </p><p>ENHANCE THE INSPECTIONS REGIME OF UNSCR 1441 WHICH, FISCHER </p><p>SUGGESTED, COULD PROVE A PARADIGM FOR APPROACHING CRISES </p><p>ELSEWHERE.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT IRAQ MUST COMPLY WITHOUT DELAY </p><p>WITH UNSCR 1441. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>MEXICO: POWELL\'S PRESENTATION VALUABLE </p><p>TO PROCESS OF DISARMING IRAQ </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) MEXICAN MINISTER OF STATE (FOREIGN MINISTER) DERBEZ </p><p>SAID THAT THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION HAD CONTAINED VALUABLE </p><p>MATERIAL TO DETERMINE AND SHAPE THE PROCESS OF DISARMING </p><p>IRAQ, AND HE REINFORCED THE NEED TO DEVELOP VERIFIABLE IRAQI </p><p>COOPERATION.  HE UNDERSCORED THAT MEXICO\'S OBJECTIVE WAS THE </p><p>UNEQUIVOCAL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ BY PEACEFUL MEANS, WITHOUT </p><p>UNDERMINING THE BATTLE ON TERRORISM.  MEXICO HAD DIRECTLY </p><p>APPROACHED IRAQ TO "ENCOURAGE" COOPERATION WITHOUT DELAY, AND </p><p>HE REITERATED THE CALL "TO THE IRAQI REPRESENTATIVE AT THIS </p><p>TABLE" TO ACTIVELY AND GENUINELY COOPERATE ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>PROVISIONS OF UNSCR 1441.  HE LATER "REITERATED THE DEMAND TO </p><p>THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THAT THEY WORK URGENTLY TO MAKE ALL </p><p>FACILITIES" ACCESSIBLE TO THE INSPECTORS.  CONCLUDING, HE </p><p>STRESSED MEXICO\'S DESIRE FOR A MULTILATERAL APPROACH TO </p><p>RESOLVING THE IRAQ CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA:  COUNCIL SHOULD PERMIT MORE TIME FOR INSPECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  SYRIAN PERMREP WEHBE, READING A STATEMENT ON BEHALF </p><p>OF FOREIGN MINISTER AL-SHARA\', SIDESTEPPED DIRECT COMMENT ON </p><p>SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION BY RECOMMENDING THAT THE INFORMATION </p><p>IT CONTAINED  SHOULD BE REVIEWED BY UNMOVIC AND IAEA.  HE </p><p>APPEALED TO OTHER MEMBER STATES ALSO TO SUBMIT RELEVANT </p><p>INFORMATION.  HE NOTED SYRIA HAD JOINED CONSENSUS ON UNSCR </p><p>1441 AFTER RECEIVING GUARANTEES FROM UNNAMED PERMANENT </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL THAT THE RESOLUTION WOULD NOT BE USED </p><p>AS A PRETEXT FOR WAR.  WEHBE SAID THAT SYRIA INTERPRETED </p><p>ONGOING DISCUSSIONS OF A SECOND RESOLUTION AS CONFIRMATION OF </p><p>THOSE ASSURANCES.  URGING THE SC TO FIND A PEACEFUL </p><p>RESOLUTION OF THE CRISIS, WEHBE DECRIED CONSIDERATION OF WAR </p><p>AS AN INDICATION OF THE  FAILURE OF UNSCR 1441 AND, MORE </p><p>GENERALLY, OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL ITSELF.  AVERTING CONFLICT </p><p>WAS IMPERATIVE IN ORDER TO SPARE THE LIVES OF IRAQI </p><p>CIVILIANS, AS WELL AS THE "LIVES OF THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD </p><p>TRAVELED TO THE REGION." IRAQ -- "UNLIKE ISRAEL" -- NEITHER </p><p>OCCUPIED TERRITORY ILLEGALLY NOR POSED A DANGER TO </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES; INSPECTIONS WOULD ALWAYS INVOLVE </p><p>HITCHES, YET THESE HITCHES DID NOT JUSTIFY WAR.  THE COUNCIL </p><p>SHOULD PERMIT MORE TIME FOR INSPECTIONS AND ALL MEMBER STATES </p><p>SHOULD ACTIVELY COOPERATE WITH UNSCR 1441  BY PROVIDING </p><p>INFORMATION TO INSPECTORS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PREVIOUS </p><p>RESOLUTIONS, THE COUNCIL SHOULD LIFT SANCTIONS ON IRAQ AND </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE CALL FOR A WMD-FREE ZONE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p>WEHBE LAUDED REGIONAL EFFORTS TOWARDS  A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION, </p><p>AND STRESSED THAT ANY MILITARY OPTION SHOULD ONLY BE </p><p>EXERCISED WITHIN AN INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK. </p><p> </p><p>PAKISTAN: INSPECTORS\' REPORTS </p><p>SHOULD CONSTITUTE BASIS FOR SC DECISION </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  PAKISTANI FOREIGN MINISTER KASURI DESCRIBED THE DAY </p><p>AS A CRITICAL AND HISTORIC MOMENT IN INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND </p><p>SECURITY, AND HE WELCOMED THE U.S. "DETERMINATION IN WORKING </p><p>THROUGH THE UN VIA UNSCR 1441."  SECRETARY POWELL HAD </p><p>PROVIDED CONSIDERABLE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>THE PROVISIONS OF 1441, WHICH SHOULD ENHANCE THE INSPECTORS\' </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS.  SUCH ENHANCEMENT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP </p><p>FORWARD IN ELIMINATING IRAQ\'S WMD PROGRAMS.  HE HOPED THE </p><p>"CONCERNS" RAISED WOULD RECEIVE "CREDIBLE ANSWERS."  THE </p><p>PROVISIONS OF UNSCRS 687, 1284, AND 1441 WERE ALL CLEAR, HE </p><p>STRESSED.  THE COUNCIL BROADLY SHARED THE VIEW THAT MORE </p><p>ACTIVE COOPERATION WAS REQUIRED, AND IN THAT CONTEXT, BLIX </p><p>AND EL-BARADEI HAD SET OUT THREE CONDITIONS: USE OF UNMANNED </p><p>AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES (UAVS); PRIVATE INTERVIEWS; </p><p>AND IRAQI LEGISLATION.  IRAQ SHOULD MOVE SWIFTLY TO MEET </p><p>THESE REQUIREMENTS AND TO RESPOND TO ANY SUBSEQUENT </p><p>REQUIREMENTS.  KASURI ASSERTED THAT THE JANUARY 27 BRIEFINGS </p><p>TO THE COUNCIL WERE NOT MEANT TO BE CONCLUSIVE.  THE </p><p>INSPECTORS\' REPORTS SHOULD CONSTITUTE THE CENTRAL BASIS ON </p><p>WHICH A UNSC DECISION WOULD BE PREDICATED, CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>THE OBJECTIVES OF EARLY COMPLIANCE BY IRAQ, AMELIORATION OF </p><p>THE SUFFERING OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, THE PRESERVATION OF IRAQ\'S </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, AND THE PRESERVATION </p><p>OF PEACE IN THE REGION, "INCLUDING THE DISPUTE OVER JAMMU AND </p><p>KASHMIR." </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN: IRAQ VIOLATED 1441, </p><p>OPTION FOR PEACE RESTS WITH SADDAM </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (U)  SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER PALACIOS RECOGNIZED THAT, </p><p>ONCE AGAIN, THE U.S. HAD COME TO THE FRAMEWORK OF THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS BY BRINGING IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL.  SECRETARY POWELL HAD SET COMPELLING DATA BEFORE THE </p><p>COUNCIL:  THE EXISTENCE OF WMD PROGRAMS AND CONFIRMATION OF </p><p>IRAQI DECEPTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  PALACIOS </p><p>SAID THAT IRAQ HAD VIOLATED ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER UNSCR 1441. </p><p> THE COUNCIL COULD NOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO ACQUIRE WEAPONS OF </p><p>MASS DESTRUCTION, AS SUCH ACQUISITION WOULD ENDANGER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY.  IT JEOPARDIZED THE VERY </p><p>EXISTENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  ONLY ONE </p><p>EXPLANATION OF THE IRAQI RESPONSE TO UNSCR 1441 WAS POSSIBLE: </p><p> SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS NOT RENOUNCED HIS PLANS TO USE SUCH </p><p>WEAPONS AS HE HAS USED THEM IN THE PAST.  SPAIN WAS GREATLY </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THESE WEAPONS MIGHT ALSO FALL INTO THE HANDS </p><p>OF A TERRORIST. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U) INSPECTIONS COULD ONLY BEAR FRUIT IF IRAQ COOPERATED </p><p>ACTIVELY, SHE STRESSED.  IT WAS TIME FOR IRAQ TO VOLUNTARILY </p><p>DISARM, AND THE INSPECTORS WERE THERE TO WITNESS DISARMAMENT </p><p>ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  BUT SADDAM HUSSEIN </p><p>LACKS THE WILL TO RESPECT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>DEMAND FOR DISARMAMENT WITHOUT DELAY AND WITHOUT CONCEALMENT. </p><p>ALTHOUGH INSPECTIONS WERE A VALUABLE INSTRUMENT, IN TWELVE </p><p>YEARS, IRAQ HAS STILL NOT DISARMED.  IT WAS TIME FOR A CLEAR </p><p>MESSAGE THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S PROGRAMS WERE A THREAT TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY, AND THAT DISARMAMENT MUST </p><p>BE IMMEDIATE, COMPLETE, AND FINAL.  DESPITE IRAQ\'S CONTINUED </p><p>NON-COMPLIANCE, THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE FOR PEACE IF IRAQ </p><p>RADICALLY MODIFIED ITS BEHAVIOR.  THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>PEACE IN IRAQ RESTS WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN.  THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY IS OFFERING ONE LAST CHANCE UNDER 1441 FOR PEACEFUL </p><p>DISARMAMENT, SHE WARNED. </p><p> </p><p>CHILE: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE VIOLATES UNSCR 1441, </p><p>COUNCIL MUST USE ALL MEANS AVAILABLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U)  CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER VALENZUELA SAID THE </p><p>SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION POINTED TO A PATTERN OF DEFIANCE AND </p><p>RESISTANCE TO UNCONDITIONAL, IMMEDIATE, AND COMPLETE </p><p>DISARMAMENT, AS FIRST CALLED FOR UNDER UNSCR 687.  UNSCR 1441 </p><p>GAVE ONE LAST OPPORTUNITY FOR DISARMAMENT, YET A REGIME THAT </p><p>HAD DRAGGED THE IRAQI PEOPLE INTO TWO WARS AND A SANCTIONS </p><p>REGIME WAS TAKING MAJOR RISKS AGAIN.  PARTIAL COMPLIANCE IN A </p><p>"PIECEMEAL" WAY AND THE NEGOTIATIONS OVER EVERY PIECE OF </p><p>INFORMATION PROVIDED, INSTEAD OF PRESENTING IT VOLUNTARILY, </p><p>WERE ALL IN VIOLATION OF 1441.  SUCH A MENTALITY DERIVED FROM </p><p>A TOTALITARIAN REGIME, SHE EMPHASIZED, QUOTING BLIX\'S </p><p>STATEMENT THAT IRAQ HAD NOT ARRIVED AT A GENUINE ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF ITS OBLIGATION TO DISARM. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U) VALENZUELA NOTED THAT CHILE STILL SUPPORTED </p><p>INSPECTIONS.  INSPECTIONS ALONE COULD "IMPOSE THE LOGIC OF </p><p>PEACE" IF PRESSURE WAS KEPT UP ON IRAQ.  IT WAS UP TO UNMOVIC </p><p>UNDER OP11 OF 1441 TO INFORM THE COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY OF ANY </p><p>INTERFERENCE OR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE </p><p>INSPECTIONS, AND SECRETARY POWELL\'S ACCUSATIONS REQUIRED A </p><p>FULL AND URGENT EXPLANATION BY IRAQ.  CHILE SUPPORTED </p><p>"RETAINING MULTILATERAL CONTROL IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS;" </p><p>THE PASSAGE OF 1441 WAS A DEMONSTRATION OF UNITY, AND THE </p><p>COUNCIL SHOULD CONTINUE TO BUILD UNITY IN THE CRUCIAL </p><p>SITUATION AHEAD.  THE IRAQI PEOPLE HAD SUFFERED OVER THE LONG </p><p>TERM UNDER SANCTIONS.  IF THERE WAS NO "RADICAL CHANGE" IN </p><p>IRAQ\'S ATTITUDE, THE COUNCIL MUST USE "ALL MEANS AVAILABLE." </p><p> </p><p>BULGARIA: IRAQ IN MATERIAL BREACH, </p><p>ALL MEANS SHOULD BE USED TO DISARM IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) BULGARIAN FOREIGN MINISTER PASSY SAID THAT "THE FACT </p><p>THE U.S. HAD COME WITH STRONG, COMPELLING EVIDENCE SHEDS </p><p>ADDITIONAL LIGHT ON IRAQI FAILURE IN IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR </p><p>1441." HE HOPED THE INFORMATION COULD BE USED TO ASSIST </p><p>UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA.  THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION WOULD </p><p>HAVE THE SAME "MOBILIZING EFFECT" ON THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY AS UNSCR 1441, REAFFIRMING TO THE IRAQIS THAT THIS </p><p>WAS THEIR LAST CHANCE FOR DISARMAMENT BY PEACEFUL MEANS.  THE </p><p>JANUARY 27 UNMOVIC AND IAEA REPORTS TO THE COUNCIL NOTED THAT </p><p>ACTIVE COOPERATION WAS A PREREQUISITE TO 1441, AND THE IRAQI </p><p>LEVEL OF COOPERATION WAS NOT SATISFACTORY.  BULGARIA INSISTED </p><p>THAT IRAQ SUPPLY ALL INFORMATION ABOUT WEAPONS PROGRAMS AND </p><p>PROVIDE EVIDENCE IT HAD UNCONDITIONALLY AND FULLY CHANGED ITS </p><p>ATTITUDE TO INSPECTIONS.  IRAQ WAS IN MATERIAL BREACH OF </p><p>PREVIOUS COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS, INCLUDING UNSCR 1441, AND </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL HAD PROVIDED NEW EVIDENCE OF THAT BREACH TO </p><p>THE COUNCIL IN HIS PRESENTATION.  ALL MEANS SHOULD BE USED TO </p><p>DISARM IRAQ, AND PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT WAS STILL POSSIBLE.  IF </p><p>THE INSPECTORS DO NOT REPORT IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT IRAQ HAS </p><p>CHANGED ITS ATTITUDE, HOWEVER, THE SECURITY COUNCIL MUST TAKE </p><p>UP ITS RESPONSIBILITIES, HE CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>CAMEROON: WAR IS NOT INEVITABLE, </p><p>ANNAN SHOULD GO TO BAGHDAD </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21. (U)  CAMEROONIAN MINISTER NGOUBEYOU STATED THAT THE </p><p>INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SECRETARY WAS "TROUBLING," AND HE </p><p>URGED THE U.S. TO PROVIDE THE INSPECTORS THIS INFORMATION AS </p><p>SOON AS POSSIBLE.  HE ALSO URGED THE COUNCIL TO GIVE THE </p><p>INSPECTORS ADEQUATE TIME TO STUDY AND USE THIS INFORMATION. </p><p>NGOUBEYOU NOTED THAT, WHILE THE COUNCIL IS NOT OBLIGED TO </p><p>DEAL WITH PUBLIC OPINION, IT WAS UNDENIABLE THAT THE ISSUE OF </p><p>IRAQ HAD BECOME A HIGH PROFILE ISSUE GLOBALLY. AT STAKE, HE </p><p>SAID, WAS THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY </p><p>AND THE RESPECT OF THE UN AS A WHOLE.  FOR THIS REASON, HE </p><p>WAS CONVINCED, HE SAID, THAT THE U.S. AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY WOULD PROCEED IN THE SPIRIT OF THE UN CHARTER AND </p><p>WOULD SOLVE THIS ISSUE THROUGH THE COUNCIL.  NGOUBEYOU ALSO </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT, GIVEN THE GRAVITY OF THIS ISSUE, THE SYG BE </p><p>ASKED TO GO TO IRAQ TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE IRAQIS, IN ORDER TO </p><p>ALLOW A SPEEDY RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.  DESPITE THE </p><p>SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION, HE CLAIMED, WAR WAS NOT </p><p>INEVITABLE. </p><p> </p><p>ANGOLA: COMPELLING INTELLIGENCE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) ANGOLAN DFM CHIKOTY STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S INITIATIVE TO SEND SECRETARY POWELL TO THE </p><p>COUNCIL, "TO SHARE WITH US THE COMPELLING INTELLIGENCE JUST </p><p>SEEN."  FOR TWENTY YEARS, IRAQ HAD BEEN AT THE CENTER OF THE </p><p>WORLD\'S SECURITY CONCERNS.  THE JANUARY 27 REPORT TO THE </p><p>COUNCIL, WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL PRESENTATION BY THE U.S., </p><p>ENABLED THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO TAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. </p><p>THE INFORMATION PRESENTED TODAY BROUGHT NEW ELEMENTS, WHICH </p><p>MUST BE ADDRESSED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL.  THE IMPORTANCE OF INSPECTORS SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>MINIMIZED, AS ONLY THROUGH COOPERATION WITH THEM COULD IRAQ </p><p>PROVE ITSELF READY TO EMBARK ON A DISARMAMENT PROGRAM. </p><p>COUNTRIES SHOULD URGENTLY PURSUE PROVIDING INFORMATION TO </p><p>UNMOVIC, HE ADDED.  PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT WAS STILL POSSIBLE, </p><p>AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD NOT EXHAUSTED ALL THE </p><p>OPTIONS BEFORE RESORTING TO WAR, HE CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>GUINEA: LIFT SANCTIONS TO INDUCE IRAQI COOPERATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>23.  (U)  GUINEAN PERMREP TRAORE, SPEAKING IN THE ABSENCE OF </p><p>HIS FOREIGN MINISTER, PRAISED THE SECRETARY\'S INITIATIVE IN </p><p>MAKING HIS PRESENTATION.  HE SAID THAT THE JANUARY 27 BLIX </p><p>/EL-BARADEI PRESENTATION REVEALED SOME IMPROVEMENT IN IRAQI </p><p>COOPERATION, YET CLEARLY THERE WERE SUBSTANTIVE DEFICITS. </p><p>IRAQ MUST OFFER COGENT EVIDENCE ON THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS </p><p>WMD, ENCOURAGE PRIVATE INTERVIEWS WITH SCIENTISTS, PROVIDE A </p><p>CREDIBLE UPDATED LIST OF SCIENTISTS, AND AUTHORIZE U-2 </p><p>OVERFLIGHTS.  ITS PAST FAILURE TO COOPERATE  DEMONSTRATED </p><p>THAT THE COUNCIL COULD NOT  ACCEPT MERE WORDS.  LIFTING </p><p>SANCTIONS, HE SUGGESTED, WOULD ENCOURAGE IRAQI COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ SPEAKS LAST </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  (U) IRAQI PERMREP AL-DOURI COMPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT </p><p>HAVE EQUAL TIME TO REBUT THE U.S. PRESENTATION, WHICH HE </p><p>DECRIED AS "UTTERLY UNRELATED TO THE TRUTH."  THE SECRETARY </p><p>HAD PRESENTED NO NEW INFORMATION, MERELY SOUND RECORDINGS </p><p>WHOSE AUTHENTICITY COULD NOT BE ASCERTAINED, HE ASSERTED.  HE </p><p>AVERRED THAT THE SOLE AIM OF THE U.S. WAS TO JUSTIFY WAR; BUT </p><p>IRAQ IS WMD-FREE, AS NUMEROUS IRAQI OFFICIALS HAVE REPEATED </p><p>FOR MORE THAN A DECADE.  MOREOVER, THE SECRETARY SHOULD HAVE </p><p>SPARED HIMSELF THE EFFORT OF APPEARING BEFORE THE COUNCIL BY </p><p>TAKING THE PRESENTATION DIRECTLY TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA, IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH OP10 OF UNSCR 1441, THUS ALLOWING THE </p><p>INSPECTORS TO "PROCEED WITH THEIR WORK IN PEACE AND QUIET." </p><p>THE FEBRUARY 8-9 VISIT TO IRAQ BY BLIX AND EL-BARADEI OFFERED </p><p>AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO ASCERTAIN THE VALIDITY OF THE U.S. </p><p>ALLEGATIONS, HE ADDED, CLAIMING THAT THE INSPECTORS HAD </p><p>PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED THE "FALSITY" OF U.S. AND UK </p><p>ALLEGATIONS.  AS PROOF OF IRAQI COOPERATION, HE REFERRED TO </p><p>IRAQ\'S 12,000 PAGE DECEMBER 7 DECLARATION, THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>MORE THAN 250 INSPECTORS IN IRAQ, AND THE 575 INSPECTIONS </p><p>COMPLETED AT MORE THAN 300 SITES AS OF FEBRUARY 4.  UNMOVIC </p><p>AND IAEA ANALYSES HAD CONFIRMED THE ABSENCE OF ANY PROSCRIBED </p><p>WMD AGENTS, HE STATED.  MOREOVER, BLIX HAD NOT FOUND ANY </p><p>EVIDENCE OF MOBILE LABS AND BLIX HAD DISCOUNTED THE ASSERTION </p><p>THAT IRAQI AGENTS WERE POSING AS SCIENTISTS IN A NEW YORK </p><p>TIMES PIECE PUBLISHED ON JANUARY 30, HE ADDED.  IRAQ HAD NO </p><p>OBJECTION TO U-2 OVERFLIGHTS IN PRINCIPLE;  HOWEVER, THESE </p><p>COULD NOT GO FORWARD UNTIL THE U.S. AND UK SUSPENDED THEIR </p><p>"ILLEGAL" NO-FLY ZONES. </p><p> </p><p>25.  (U)  AL-DOURI REJECTED U.S. EVIDENCE OF IRAQI </p><p>CONCEALMENT AND TRUCK TRANSPORTATION OF INCRIMINATING </p><p>MATERIALS PRIOR TO INSPECTIONS, DECLARING THAT INSPECTIONS </p><p>WERE TAKING PLACE WITHOUT ADVANCE WARNING.  MOREOVER, </p><p>UNMOVIC, THANKS TO ITS HELICOPTERS AND OTHER RESOURCES, WAS </p><p>TOO WELL-INFORMED FOR SUCH ALLEGED CONCEALMENT TO ELUDE </p><p>NOTICE, HE SAID.  WMD PROGRAMS "WERE NOT ASPIRIN PILLS THAT </p><p>COULD BE EASILY HIDDEN."  ON THE CONTRARY, THE U.S. EVIDENCE </p><p>"COULD EASILY BE FABRICATED."  AL-DOURI REPUDIATED ANY </p><p>LINKAGE BETWEEN IRAQ AND AL-QAEDA, CITING NEW YORK TIMES </p><p>REPORTING ON COMPLAINTS BY CIA ANALYSTS THAT THE U.S. </p><p>EXAGGERATED EVIDENCE ON AL-QAEDA TO BOLSTER ITS CASE FOR WAR. </p><p> SIMILARLY, HE ACCUSED FM STRAW OF WILLFULLY IGNORING UK </p><p>ANALYSIS CASTING DOUBTS ON A LINKAGE TO AL-QAEDA.   AGAIN </p><p>QUOTING THE NEW YORK TIMES,  HE ASSERTED THAT THE USG HAD </p><p>KNOWN, SINCE 1988, THAT IRAQ HAD NOT, IN FACT, DEPLOYED </p><p>CHEMICAL AGENTS. THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION WAS DESIGNED TO </p><p>SELL U.S. AND WORLD PUBLIC OPINION ON THE CASE FOR WAR IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF CONVINCING LEGAL, MORAL, OR POLITICAL </p><p>JUSTIFICATIONS, HE ALLEGED.  IRAQ, HOWEVER, OFFERED A PATH OF </p><p>PEACE, HE CONCLUDED, APPENDING A LAST COMMENT THAT IT WAS </p><p>ISRAEL THAT POSED THE REAL WMD THREAT IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEGROPONTE </p><p></p></div>
