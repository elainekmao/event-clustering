<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000829 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, USAID/FFP/EB, IO, AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR C&MP AND EC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETTC, EAID, EAGR, ETRD, IZ, VM, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM ON OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 82506 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an action request -- see para 10. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  SUMMARY:  Vietnam is interested in continuing its </p><p>exports of rice until the Oil for Food (OFF) Program, </p><p>especially in quickly fulfilling outstanding rice contracts, </p><p>but has concerns about insurance costs and port access.  The </p><p>MFA stressed that Vietnam\'s participation would not/not be </p><p>affected by the expressed opposition of Iraq to UNSCR 1472. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  VINAFOOD 1:  Agatt and AgSpec on April 1 discussed </p><p>the OFF Program with Luong The Phiet, Deputy General </p><p>Director of  Vietnam Northern Food Corporation (Vinafood 1 - </p><p>- the GVN\'s parastatal agricultural exporting agency) and </p><p>Dinh Cong Chinh of its Foreign Economic Department.  They </p><p>welcomed the clear USG statements supporting the OFF </p><p>program, and said they were eagerly awaiting shipping </p><p>information from the UN\'s OFF Office. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  OUTSTANDING:  Phiet confirmed that Vinafood had </p><p>been a major supplier of rice to Iraq over the last 10 </p><p>years, exporting more than 840,000 metric tons of rice to </p><p>Iraq in 2002 alone.  He added Vinafood was eager to fulfill </p><p>the outstanding (not yet shipped) rice contracts, amounting </p><p>to another 450,000 metric tons.  Vinafood is ready to ship </p><p>that rice after resolving issues of insurance and port </p><p>facilities. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  INSURANCE:  Phiet expressed concern over whether </p><p>insurance could be purchased to cover both the commodity </p><p>(rice) and the vessels going to Iraq.  He welcomed the </p><p>information that the U.S. Maritime Administration has war </p><p>risk insurance, but asked if that insurance would cover the </p><p>value of the commodity as well as the vessel.  Furthermore, </p><p>he asked how high the premiums might be. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  PORT FACILITIES:  Vietnam has routinely shipped </p><p>rice to the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr and has been in touch </p><p>with port contacts, who had expressed worries about </p><p>submerged mines damaging or destroying any large vessels </p><p>trying to berth.  He was aware that one or two small vessels </p><p>had docked, but noted that larger vessels might still </p><p>confront a dangerous situation. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  OTHER ISSUES:  Phiet also noted there was a host of </p><p>smaller concerns that would probably have to be addressed by </p><p>the UN\'s Office of the Iraq Program.  Among those concerns: </p><p>--  adjustments to the outstanding contracts and letters of </p><p>credit necessitated by delays in shipping (note:  some of </p><p>which stem from Vietnam\'s inability to ship in late 2002 due </p><p>to lack of stocks, and others due to insurance and port </p><p>access issues); </p><p>--  concerns regarding which company would be the new UN </p><p>Independent Inspection Agent (replacing, if necessary, </p><p>Cotecna); </p><p>--  who would be the buyer.  In the past, the Grain Board of </p><p>Iraq had been the buyer of record. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  FUTURE:  Phiet emphasized that, in addition to </p><p>fulfilling outstanding contracts, Vietnam would welcome new </p><p>oil-for-food business as well.  He noted that the rice </p><p>supplies were now available (the Winter-Spring rice harvest </p><p>is underway).  If vessels were willing, Vietnam could export </p><p>rice to Iraqi ports in three weeks. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  MFA:  In a separate meeting on April 3, Pol/C </p><p>conveyed reftel points to MFA West Asia and Africa </p><p>Department Deputy Director General Doan Ngoc Boi.  Boi </p><p>expressed appreciation for the US support for OFF, but </p><p>wondered whether this interest in humanitarian programs for </p><p>Iraq was not rather new.  Pol/C reviewed briefly US support </p><p>for solutions to Iraq\'s humanitarian problems over the past </p><p>decade and commitment to ensuring better lives for the Iraqi </p><p>people.  Boi noted that the Iraqi Government had expressed </p><p>its opposition to UNSCR 1472; when questioned, he assured </p><p>Pol/C that the GVN would not/not side with the GOI on this </p><p>and would welcome the opportunity both to complete past OFF </p><p>contracts and to compete for new ones under the new UN </p><p>arrangements.  He noted over USD400 million in OFF contracts </p><p>with Vietnam in the works for 2003. </p><p>10.  (U)  ACTION REQUESTED:  Please clarify issues regarding </p><p>insurance and port access, and provide any other additional </p><p>information of relevance. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
