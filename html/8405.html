(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid, in a 5/31 </p><p>meeting with the Ambassador (other topics covered </p><p>septel), provided a brief readout on an earlier </p><p>meeting between former Iraqi Foreign Minister Adnan </p><p>Pachachi and UAE President Zayid bin Sultan Al- </p><p>Nahyan.  Pachachi and Zayid met for over an hour to </p><p>review events in Iraq.  Pachachi was reportedly </p><p>very positive about the U.S. role in Iraq, noting </p><p>that he had met with U.S. and UK officials there </p><p>and that he greatly valued these exchanges. </p><p>Pachachi acknowledged that absent the strong and </p><p>helpful U.S. presence, the country would be plunged </p><p>into chaos and that a "catastrophe" would ensue. </p><p>Hamdan noted that in the UAE\'s view, Pachachi had </p><p>emerged as one of the only viable Iraqi political </p><p>leaders, though he admitted that Pachachi\'s </p><p>advanced age (he recently turned 80) would limit </p><p>his ability to serve publicly beyond a couple of </p><p>years.  (Comment:  We pass on this readout because </p><p>in past public statements, Pachachi has been quite </p><p>critical of what he has termed the U.S. </p><p>"occupation."  It is clear that having spent some </p><p>time on the ground in Baghdad -- after an absence </p><p>of over thirty years -- Pachachi perhaps has come </p><p>to appreciate the complexity of the situation.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hamdan went on to reiterate continuing </p><p>Emirati concern, outlined by COS Muhammad bin Zayid </p><p>during his recent Washington visit, about Iranian </p><p>meddling in Iraq.  Hamdan said it was "very scary" </p><p>to see what the Iranians were doing and the </p><p>Emiratis are watching events with increasing alarm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
