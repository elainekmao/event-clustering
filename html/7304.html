<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002317 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT CONTINUES TO DELAY ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ANKARA 8534 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons 1.5 (b and d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Action request--para 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Feza Ozturk, head of the MFA International Political </p><p>Organizations Department, told us April 7 the MFA has put its </p><p>consideration of a draft bilateral Article 98 agreement on </p><p>hold.  Ozturk attributed the hold to "the situation in Iraq." </p><p> He averred that the MFA supports an agreement in principle, </p><p>but does not want to expose the GOT to speculation about why </p><p>it is signing such an agreement during the war.  We responded </p><p>that the USG is looking for areas of cooperation it can point </p><p>to in its relationship with Turkey.  Ozturk replied that MFA </p><p>DG for Multilateral Political Affairs Batibay has decided </p><p>against signing an agreement until after the conflict in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment and action request: Once again the GOT has </p><p>given a reason to delay an agreement.  Until such time as EU </p><p>members begin to accept agreements we believe Turkey will </p><p>continue to avoid concluding an agreement with us.  A </p><p>sustained, high-level effort might gain traction, but we </p><p>would welcome information on the status of Article 98 </p><p>discussions with the EU and leading EU members. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
