(SBU) Summary.  Despite the precision in the French </p><p>adoption agreement with Vietnam, French adoptions are </p><p>encountering problems at the provincial levels.  Significant </p><p>problems include demands for donations/fees in excess of </p><p>those set in the French agreement, unclear origins of </p><p>adoptive children (some of whom are rumored to have been </p><p>trafficked from China or Cambodia), and the withholding of </p><p>children pending the finalization of an MOU with the </p><p>Americans - because the Americans "will pay much more." </p><p>Central authorities reportedly are investigating such </p><p>concerns, but often lack the power to halt problems at the </p><p>provincial level.  A French adoption official in Hanoi fears </p><p>that a premature agreement between the U.S. and Vietnam </p><p>could serve to exacerbate the problems on the ground.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTING FRENCH ADOPTIONS OFFICIAL </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On July 25th, Consul spoke with the departing </p><p>official responsible for international adoptions at the </p><p>French Embassy, Pierrette Collomb.  Collomb had been in this </p><p>position for three years, focusing solely on adoptions. </p><p>During her tenure, she served as the point-person throughout </p><p>the negotiation of the French agreement, processed adoptions </p><p>for French adoptive parents, maintained relations with </p><p>provincial and central government authorities, investigated </p><p>fraud, and visited orphanages regularly. </p><p> </p><p>DESPITE TOUGH FRENCH AGREEMENT - PROBLEMS PERSIST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Collomb described the French agreement as having </p><p>tight controls.  All French adoptive parents must make a USD </p><p>3000 `donation\' to the GVN. This amount is established in </p><p>the French agreement and covers the expenses of the </p><p>orphanage as well as the processing expenses of the </p><p>provincial and central government.  Any indication that an </p><p>amount larger than the set donation has been paid is grounds </p><p>for nullifying an adoption.  In addition, the GOF also </p><p>retains the authority to approve all adoption agencies and </p><p>facilitators - called "associations" - that can operate in </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Despite these strictures in the French agreement, </p><p>Collomb has encountered a number of problematic adoption </p><p>dossiers.  The primary anomaly, encountered in many </p><p>dossiers, was requests for donations or payment of fees in </p><p>excess of the pre-determined US$3000. Another very </p><p>disturbing problem is the lack of clear history for the </p><p>children up for adoption in many provinces.  Documents </p><p>demonstrating their biological parentage, those parent\'s </p><p>ties to the province, or those parent\'s intent to relinquish </p><p>the children are often unavailable or questionable.  In </p><p>provinces where donations or documentation are consistent </p><p>problems, Collomb reports that she consistently sees the </p><p>same signatures (of provincial level officials) with </p><p>inordinate frequency.  Collomb also believes rumors that </p><p>many children continue to be trafficked across provincial </p><p>borders (which is not allowed) and even transnational </p><p>borders.  (Note:  Rumors have abounded for years that many </p><p>children adopted from Vietnam were trafficked to Vietnam </p><p>from China or Cambodia.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Finally, and of particular concern, Collomb was </p><p>eager to report that many provinces simply refuse to make </p><p>children available because "they are waiting for the </p><p>Americans who will pay much more." </p><p> </p><p>6.  She identified a non-comprehensive list of provinces </p><p>from which dossiers tend toward such anomalies and </p><p>hindrances - Ba Ria Vung Tau, Ho Chi Minh, Da Nang, Ha Noi, </p><p>Ha Tay, Hai Phong, Bac Giang, and Thai Nguyen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SPECIFICS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Collomb did cite some examples from specific </p><p>provinces.  In Bac Giang, a province in which U.S. adoptive </p><p>parents previously encountered difficulties, the MOJ is </p><p>investigating claims that children are being smuggled from </p><p>China.  Adoptions are currently halted in Bac Giang pending </p><p>the investigation.  In Hanoi, adoption officials have been </p><p>the most blatant in declaring that they will wait for the </p><p>American agreement and the associated money. In Thai Nguyen </p><p>Province, Collomb has seen a disproportionate number of </p><p>girls being made available for adoption.  She indicates that </p><p>most legitimate orphans are simply third or subsequent </p><p>children that families cannot afford, and thus are equally </p><p>likely to be boys.  However, as boys are traditionally </p><p>expected to provide for their parents, if biological parents </p><p>are being `convinced\' to give up children, it is easier to </p><p>convince them to give up girls than boys.  This may also </p><p>indicate a possible link to trafficking in children from </p><p>China, where girls are frequently "given up" in preference </p><p>for a boy.  Finally, she reported a case in Hai Phong in </p><p>which, when asked in the final stages of processing the </p><p>adoption, the mother did not consent (and said she had never </p><p>consented) to relinquish the child.  Here Collomb said the </p><p>system worked and the adoption did not go through, but she </p><p>also expressed concern that this demonstrated that </p><p>provincial and orphanage officials are willing to indicate </p><p>that a child was available when the child was clearly not. </p><p> </p><p>SUPPLY HAS SHRUNK </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Significantly, Collomb noted that while orphanages </p><p>were crowded prior to the implementation of Decree 68 </p><p>(described in ref D), when "fees" were paid freely, there </p><p>are few children in the orphanages now.  She says that while </p><p>approximately 400 adoptions have gone through since the </p><p>French agreement was ratified, there are still 1000 cases of </p><p>adoptive parents to whom children have not been made </p><p>available.  She feels that this is due to the relatively low </p><p>set donation - the market incentive is just not there. </p><p> </p><p>GVN RESPONSE TO PROBLEMS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Collomb believes that the problems lie in the </p><p>provinces.  She says that the central authorities are </p><p>generally quite good at pursuing cases when anomalies arise, </p><p>but that they simply don\'t have the power, means, or </p><p>authority to halt these inaccuracies and abuses.  The </p><p>central authorities investigate many cases and questionable </p><p>results often result in nullification of the adoption, but </p><p>some cases do go through.  Collomb indicated that the MOJ </p><p>sent letters to provinces that were particularly problematic </p><p>(she did not indicate which provinces), and those provinces </p><p>now simply refuse to work with French adoptive parents. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Collomb did applaud the GVN\'s efforts to reduce </p><p>abuse of international adoptions through Decree 68 and the </p><p>establishment of new authorities and procedures.  She feels </p><p>that the GVN has moved far forward in the time she was here. </p><p>Unfortunately, her general conclusion is that despite the </p><p>GVN\'s progress and good intentions, the legal systems are </p><p>not in place, the central authorities do not have enough </p><p>power, and "Vietnam is just not ready."  Likely in reference </p><p>to the American dollars which provincial level official </p><p>associate with American adoptions, she added:  "An American </p><p>agreement will only exacerbate the problems we are </p><p>encountering.  When Vietnam is ready to deal with these </p><p>problems, it will be ready to join the Hague." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  The central authorities\' inability to enforce </p><p>policies at the provincial levels is endemic in Vietnam. </p><p>Recent examples include BTA implementation and treatment of </p><p>ethnic minorities.  In addition, it bears mentioning that </p><p>the central authorities related to international adoption </p><p>are in flux as reported in refs A and B.  The future </p><p>reaction of these as yet unnamed officials to similar </p><p>anomalies cannot be predicted. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) While the views reported in this cable are only </p><p>one official\'s views, that official has worked on this issue </p><p>intensively for three years.  In addition, Collomb\'s views </p><p>are simply further corroboration of the findings uncovered </p><p>and reported by DHS/HCMC over the past three years.  It was </p><p>DHS/HCMC\'s findings that spurred the GVN to pass Decree 68. </p><p>The potential for such problems to arise should be kept in </p><p>mind as we continue to work for progress on seeking a new </p><p>arrangement with Vietnam to allow international adoptions </p><p>with the United States. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
