<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 002384 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, PMAT; OSD FOR ISA AND ISP; JCS </p><p>FOR J5; EUCOM FOR J5, POLAD; CENTCOM FOR J5 AND POLAD; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ, PKK </p><p>SUBJECT: REFUTING THE TURKISH ALLEGATION OF SPE KHALILZAD </p><p>MEETING WITH THE PKK/KADEK </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 93831 B) ANKARA 2330 C) ANKARA 2362 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(u) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) DCM called on MFA Director General for Bilateral </p><p>Affairs Burcuoglu to refute strongly the Turkish allegations </p><p>of a March 29 meeting between SPE Khalilzad and PKK/Kadek </p><p>(ref a).  DCM also presented Burcuoglu with a diplomatic note </p><p>containing language drawn from ref a.  DCM stressed that the </p><p>information contained in TGS\'s letter was baseless and that </p><p>the USG should not have to respond to such spurious </p><p>allegations.  Burcuoglu replied he was unaware that TGS had </p><p>sent such a letter and, having not seen its contents, could </p><p>not comment at the present time.  He asked the DCM provide </p><p>him a copy of TGS\'s letter (which we later did), and said he </p><p>would respond to the Embassy\'s diplomatic note with a formal </p><p>response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Speaking in general terms, Burcuoglu said it was </p><p>important for the GOT to relay reports of incidents of </p><p>concern in northern Iraq, and asked the USG to continue to </p><p>respond to such requests in order to keep the channels of </p><p>communication open.  The DCM said it was one thing for the </p><p>USG and the GOT to cooperate in order to verify the accuracy </p><p>of reports of possible early-warning events in northern Iraq. </p><p> It was another thing for a senior TGS officer to make such </p><p>baseless allegations against a senior USG official, and to </p><p>make those allegations in writing through military channels. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
