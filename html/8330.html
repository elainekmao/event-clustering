End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On May 26, Ambassador paid a congratulatory call on </p><p>newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of </p><p>Planning and International Cooperation Ahmed Sofan.  Sofan </p><p>was promoted in the recently formed cabinet from Minister of </p><p>Planning and Development to Deputy Prime Minister and his </p><p>ministry was given new oversight authority over international </p><p>cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>New Agenda: Economics and Combating Terrorism </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Sofan highlighted three priorities for the new </p><p>government\'s agenda: economic reforms, implementation of the </p><p>poverty reduction strategy formulated by the World Bank, and </p><p>enhancing counterterrorism activities. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Expressing concern over the effect of declining oil </p><p>prices on the Yemeni economy, Sofan said that if oil prices </p><p>fall below 25 USD a barrel the ROYG may seek donor support. </p><p>Even now, he added that the public may be surprised at next </p><p>year\'s budget, implying that there may be cuts.  Adding that </p><p>regional economic cooperation has not fulfilled expectations, </p><p>Sofan said that the Yemeni public may see a disconnect </p><p>between their social welfare needs and the current economic </p><p>reality. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Sofan predicted that he thought Yemen would be more </p><p>forthcoming in the political realm of combating terrorism by </p><p>making its position very clear to the public.  On a related </p><p>issue, the Ambassador raised the long-delayed gun control </p><p>legislation -- which inter alia could ban private ownership </p><p>of MANPADS -- and noted its passage would be an "important </p><p>step." Sofan responded by saying that he thought they were </p><p>going to succeed in gaining its passage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Free Trade Agreement: Supportive, but </p><p>Regional Integration Faces Hurdles </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Sofan supports President Bush\'s Middle East Free Trade </p><p>Initiative because he believes it will offer better </p><p>assistance to the private sector than other USG assistance </p><p>projects.  He specifically asked for an American firm to help </p><p>with Yemen\'s public relations and complained that the ROYG </p><p>received very little assistance in that area from other </p><p>donors. Programs funded by the USG through the National </p><p>Democratic Institute to facilitate democracy, Sofan added, </p><p>were helping Yemen\'s reputation.  However, he repeated, an </p><p>American PR firm was the best solution to promote Yemen\'s </p><p>tourism, business and image abroad. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Turning to the possibility of regional free trade </p><p>agreements, Sofan recalled that in the past, internal Arab </p><p>politics had frustrated regional trade promotion programs. </p><p>Recalling the first Arab Free Trade Agreement in 1958, Sofan </p><p>declared that no progress has been made since then to </p><p>facilitate trade. Moreover, the U.S. Free Trade Agreement </p><p>with Jordan has hurt Egyptian textile trade with the U.S. </p><p>Sofan noted that the Gulf countries have similar economies </p><p>and must compete against each other for business. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Instead, Sofan encouraged the USG to consider short </p><p>term initiatives that would help the Yemeni economy and </p><p>pledged that he would work with the USG to determine what was </p><p>needed. For example, he thought the Ministry of Trade and </p><p>Industry may need special experts on preparation of documents </p><p>for World Trade Organization accession. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Civil Service Reform: The Slower Approach </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Sofan reinforced the new government\'s committment to </p><p>civil service reform, saying there was "no question of not </p><p>doing it." Suggesting that as many as 300,000 civil servants </p><p>would eventually have to be laid off, and that salaries would </p><p>have to be raised to ten times the amount presently offered, </p><p>Sofan said the new government would embark, of necessity, on </p><p>a "slower approach" to civil service reform.  The government </p><p>will focus on encouraging employees to retire, ending "double </p><p>dippers" (people who hold jobs at more than one ministry) and </p><p>minimizing the bureaucracy. Sofan added that the World Bank </p><p>program on civil service reform would not be sufficient to </p><p>carry out a complete overhaul of the civil serve and there </p><p>may be areas for future USG cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Encouraging Increased Interaction </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Positively assessing USG and ROYG assistance </p><p>cooperation, Sofan pledged to continue USG and ROYG close </p><p>interaction, especially with the imminent arrival of USAID. </p><p>Ambassador described the process that determines whether </p><p>Yemen qualifies for the Millennium Challenge Account and </p><p>pointed out that he may return to Sofan and ask for his </p><p>specific help in certain categories where Yemen may fall </p><p>short. Sofan agreed and pledged to work closely on MCA. </p><p>Sofan closed by explaining that his new Ministry was created </p><p>to centralize all interaction on assistance, with the goal of </p><p>stemming corruption. Before, he added, too many Ministries </p><p>were involved in making decisions on assistance and this </p><p>process allowed for corruption. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
