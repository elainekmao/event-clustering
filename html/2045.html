<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 176819 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AF, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE (CORRECTED COPY) </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A)STATE 175414 (NOTAL), (B)ISLAMABAD 5601 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY: CHRISTINA B. ROCCA, ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS; REASON: 1.5 (B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>(U) THIS IS A CORRECTED COPY OF CABLE PREVIOUSLY SENT WITH </p><p>SAME SUBJECT. (MRN NOT AVAILABLE) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ACTION ADDRESSEES SHOULD DRAW FROM POINTS BELOW IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS REGARDING U.S. VIEWS ON </p><p>THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. NOTING SPECIFICALLY </p><p>THAT THESE ARE PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS, ACTION ADDRESSEES </p><p>SHOULD REQUEST HOST COUNTRY INPUT. EMBASSY ISLAMABAD HAS </p><p>MADE A SIMILAR APPROACH (REF A) TO THE GOP BUT MAY USE </p><p>THESE EXPANDED POINTS TO AMPLIFY ITS DISCUSSION. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BACKGROUND: </p><p> </p><p>-- AFGHANISTAN\'S STABILITY IS PREDICATED UPON HAVING A </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITHOUT TERRORIST TIES, FRIENDLY TO ITS </p><p>NEIGHBORS, ABLE TO GOVERN, AND ENGAGED IN OVERALL REGIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION AND ECONOMIC REHABILITATION. A FUTURE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL LIKELY EMERGE FROM THE "SUPREME COUNCIL" </p><p>UNDER FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH\'S SYMBOLIC LEADERSHIP WITH </p><p>NORTHERN ALLIANCE, MAJOR ETHNIC, PARTICULARLY PASHTUN, AND </p><p>SECTARIAN GROUPS. AFGHANISTAN WILL NEED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE WITH A SECURITY ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD PROVIDE </p><p>STABILITY FOR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL RECOVERY, </p><p>INCLUDING HOLDING KABUL AND OTHER URBAN AREAS, AND PROTECT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WORKERS FROM </p><p>THOSE THAT SEEK TO CONTINUE THE CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>-- AFGHANS WILL NEED HELP TO FORM A GOVERNMENT THAT IN </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN CLOSE </p><p>DOWN TERRORISTS\' OPERATIONS, ADHERES TO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>NORMS AND PRACTICES, PARTICULARLY HUMAN RIGHTS AND ISSUES </p><p>CONCERNING WOMEN, AND FACILITATES SAFE DELIVERY OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE. CONSULTATIONS WITH </p><p>COALITION PARTNERS, PARTICULARLY ISLAMIC COUNTRIES AND </p><p>REGIONAL STATES, WILL BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTING A SECURITY ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD BE WELCOMED </p><p>BY THE "SUPREME COUNCIL" AND A FUTURE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) TALKING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- WITH EVENTS MOVING RAPIDLY, WE BELIEVE IT IMPERATIVE TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. WE </p><p>ANTICIPATE MANY FUTURE, DETAILED EXCHANGES </p><p>OF VIEWS ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AS EVENTS PROCEED. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT </p><p>INTEND TO, NOR DO WE BELIEVE WE COULD, DETERMINE THIS </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS YOU KNOW WE ARE PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN AID TO COMBAT </p><p>THE PRESENT CRISIS. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COULD WORK TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY </p><p>IN A FUTURE AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- USG WELCOMES APPOINTMENT OF AMBASSADOR LAKHDAR BRAHIMI </p><p>AS SECRETARY GENERAL\'S SPECIAL ENVOY FOR AFGHANISTAN AND </p><p>LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM. WE EXPECT TO ENGAGE IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM IN THE NEAR FUTURE REGARDING HIS </p><p>ROLE. WE ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO BE IN CONTACT WITH HIM AS </p><p>WELL. </p><p> </p><p> -- WE BELIEVE YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS A KEY ROLE TO PLAY IN </p><p>SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF AFGHANISTAN. WE WELCOME INCREASED </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE FORMER KING AND BROADENED CONTACTS WITH </p><p>AFGHANS TO ENCOURAGE ANTI-TALIBAN UNITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE HAVE ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE FORMER KING AT A </p><p>HIGH LEVEL AND EXPECT TO BE ENGAGING IN SIMILAR </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND OTHER </p><p>INDEPENDENT AFGHANS, PARTICULARLY PASHTUNS, INSIDE AND </p><p>OUTSIDE AFGHANISTAN. WE WELCOME THE FORMATION OF A </p><p>SUPREME COUNCIL FOR NATIONAL UNITY OF AFGHANISTAN </p><p>COMBINING THE ROME GROUP WITH THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND </p><p>OTHER AFGHAN GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE ARE LOOKING AT PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE </p><p>ROME GROUP TO DEFRAY IMMEDIATE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. </p><p> </p><p>-- ULTIMATELY, IT IS UP TO THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN TO </p><p>DETERMINE THEIR OWN FUTURE. THAT SAID, WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>THERE ARE CERTAIN GENERALLY ACCEPTED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRINCIPLES WHICH ANY GOVERNMENT WILL NEED TO ADHERE TO. IT </p><p>WILL NEED TO BE BROAD-BASED, MULTI-ETHNIC, AND GENERALLY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE, RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, END ALL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TERRORISM, AND FOLLOW ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>-- BY DEFINITION, ANY TRANSITION OR FUTURE GOVERNMENT </p><p>COULD NOT BE COMPOSED OF JUST ONE AFGHAN FACTION. TO BE </p><p>SPECIFIC, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE </p><p>(COMPOSED LARGELY OF TAJIKS AND UZBEKS) ALONE COULD OR </p><p>SHOULD RULE AFGHANISTAN GIVEN ITS LIMITED ETHNIC </p><p>COMPOSITION. THE NA WILL, OF COURSE, HAVE A ROLE IN ANY </p><p>FUTURE GOVERNMENT, AS SHOULD OTHER SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF </p><p>AFGHAN SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT AFGHANISTAN\'S NEIGHBORS HAVE </p><p>LEGITIMATE NATIONAL INTERESTS RELATING TO AFGHANISTAN. WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT ANY FUTURE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE THOSE </p><p> </p><p>INTERESTS INTO ACCOUNT. PAKISTAN DOES NOT WANT TO BE FACED </p><p>WITH A HOSTILE AFGHANISTAN WITH TERRITORIAL CLAIMS. IRAN </p><p>WANTS THE SHI\'A PROTECTED AND NO DRUGS. PAKISTAN AND IRAN </p><p>WANT REFUGEES TO RETURN HOME. UZBEKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, </p><p>AND TAJIKISTAN WANT PEACEFUL BORDERS. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE WOULD NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT OTHER NEIGHBORING </p><p>COUNTRIES ALSO HAVE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS IN THE FUTURE </p><p>POLITICAL SETUP IN AFGHANISTAN. WE DO NOT SEE ANY </p><p>IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT AMONG THESE INTERESTS AS LONG AS </p><p>AFGHANS AND OUTSIDE INTERESTS ARE FLEXIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE HAVE MADE THESE POINTS TO OUR AFGHAN CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- YOUR COOPERATION IS VITAL AND WELCOMED ON ALL </p><p>FRONTS. WE EXPECT TO BE IN FREQUENT CONTACT WITH YOU ON </p><p>THIS TOPIC AND WELCOME YOUR VIEWS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BELOW ADDRESSEES SHOULD ADD THE FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>FOR SIX PLUS TWO MEMBERS: </p><p> </p><p>-- YOUR COUNTRY, ALONG WITH AFGHANISTAN\'S OTHER NEIGHBORS, </p><p>HAS LEGITIMATE NATIONAL INTERESTS RELATING TO AFGHANISTAN </p><p>THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. YOUR COOPERATION IS </p><p>VITAL TO THE EMERGENCE OF A FUTURE PEACEFUL, STABLE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE ARE CONSIDERING WHEN AND AT WHAT LEVEL THE SIX PLUS </p><p>TWO MIGHT MEET TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>FOR EMBASSY NEW DELHI: </p><p> </p><p>-- INDIA HAS A LONG HISTORY WITH AFGHANISTAN AS WELL AS </p><p>KEY INTERESTS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. INDIA, </p><p>LIKE PAKISTAN, SHOULD NOT BE FACED WITH A HOSTILE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- INDIA\'S COOPERATION IS VITAL AND WELCOMED. WE </p><p>ANTICIPATE A DIALOGUE WITH INDIA ON REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS </p><p>OF THIS TOPIC AS THE SITUATION DEVELOPS. </p><p> </p><p>FOR EMBASSY TOKYO: </p><p> </p><p>-- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR STRONG INTEREST IN THE </p><p>ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE VALUE OUR BILATERAL EXCHANGES ON THIS ISSUE, BOTH IN </p><p>TOKYO AND IN WASHINGTON, AS WELL AS ON THE MARGINS OF </p><p>RECENT MEETINGS IN BERLIN AND GENEVA. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE ALSO THINK YOUR SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN AS IT GRAPPLES </p><p>WITH ITS ECONOMIC NEEDS IS VERY HELPFUL, ESPECIALLY AS </p><p>PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF HAS BEEN TAKING RISKS DOMESTICALLY BY </p><p>JOINING OUR INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE VIEW YOU AS AN INTEGRAL PARTNER AS WE FOCUS ON AN </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND POLITICAL/ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN FOR A </p><p>FUTURE AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>FOR EMBASSY PARIS: </p><p> </p><p>-- WE WERE DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT, IN YOUR EXCELLENT PLAN </p><p>FOR ASSISTING AFGHANISTAN, YOU ARE CONCENTRATING ON THE </p><p>SAME AREAS OUR OWN THINKING ENCOMPASSES. FRENCH </p><p>LEADERSHIP ON THHIS ISSUE WILL ASSURE THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ADDRESSES THESE URGENT TASKS </p><p>EFFICIENTLY AND WELL. WE SHOULD STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH ON </p><p>THE WAY FORWARD. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE SHARE YOUR PARTICULAR CONCERNS REGARDING ERADICATION </p><p>OF OPIUM POPPY CULTIVATION. </p><p> </p><p>--WE BELIEVE FRANCE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE EU HAVE AN </p><p>IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN PROVIDING A BETTER FUTURE FOR </p><p>THE AFGHAN PEOPLE AND WELCOME THE EU\'S EXPERTISE IN </p><p>DEVISING A RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) DUSHANBE MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
