<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000343 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES ELECTION OBSERVATION, ELECTION </p><p>PROSPECTS AND POST-ELECTION PLANNING WITH BRITISH OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HARARE 315 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  C)  THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER TO ZIMBABWE, BRIAN DONNELLY, </p><p>JOINED BY FCO DIRECTOR FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA ANDREW POCOCK AND IAN </p><p>BAILEY FROM THE BRITISH CABINET OFFICE CALLED ON THE AMBASSADOR ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 6.  THE AMBASSADOR WAS ACCOMPANIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DONNELLY REPORTED THAT THE EU HAD BEEN GIVEN AN UNSIGNED </p><p>LETTER BY FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE ON FEBRUARY 5 INVITING THE EU </p><p>AND ACP TO SEND AN OBSERVER DELEGATION.  HE SAID THE WORDING OF THE </p><p>INVITATION WAS STRANGE, SAYING  "THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE WOULD </p><p>BE HONORED IF THE EU-ACP DELEGATION INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING NINE </p><p>COUNTRIES..."  THE SIX EU MEMBERS NOT LISTED, DONNELLY SAID, WERE </p><p>THE UNITED KINGDOM, GERMANY, DENMARK, SWEDEN, FINLAND, AND THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS.   THE EU, POCOCK NOTED, NOW NEEDS TO DETERMINE WHETHER </p><p>THE LATTER SIX COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN DEFINITIVELY RULED OUT OR </p><p>WHETHER THE GOZ HAS SIMPLY EXPRESSED A PREFERENCE THAT THEY NOT </p><p>PARTICIPATE. POCOCK SAID HE ASSUMED THAT IMPOSITION OF TARGETED </p><p>SANCTIONS BY THE EU WOULD LIKELY PRECLUDE AN EU OBSERVER MISSION, </p><p>SO IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO HOLD BACK ON A SANCTIONS DECISION AT </p><p>LEAST UNTIL THE FULL DELEGATION WAS IN PLACE.  DONNELLY ADDED THAT </p><p>MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAD TOLD THEM THAT MORNING THAT </p><p>GETTING OBSERVERS ON THE GROUND SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00343  01 OF 02  071428Z </p><p>AND HAD URGED THE EU TO KEEP THE POSSIBILITY OF SANCTIONS PENDING </p><p>AND HANGING OVER THE GOZ FOR NOW.  POCOCK SAID THE GERMANS AND THE </p><p>DANES ARE THE EU\'S HARDLINERS ON ZIMBABWE AND ARE PUSHING FOR AN </p><p>IMMEDIATE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS. (LATE ON FEBRUARY 6, DONNELLY </p><p>TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE EU RECEIVED THE FINAL, SIGNED VERSION </p><p>OF THE MUDENGE LETTER WHICH ADDS EXTRA SALT TO THE MIX BY INSISTING </p><p>THAT THE ACP HEAD THE EU DELEGATION.  BRITISH HC TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT THIS ADDED INSULT COULD SWING THE EU MINISTERIAL </p><p>MEETING OF FEB 8 AGAINST ACCEPTING SUCH AN OBSERVATION INVITATION </p><p>AND IN FAVOR OF SANCTIONS, SINCE GERMANY AND OTHERS WERE ALREADY </p><p>ARGUING IN FAVOR OF SANCTIONS.) THE AMBASSADOR REPORTED THAT MDC MP </p><p>DAVID COLTART HAD IMPRESSED UPON HIM THE DAY BEFORE THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF ENSURING THAT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS BE PRESENT AT ALL 120 </p><p>COUNTING CENTERS, AND THAT THEY BE DEPLOYED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE </p><p>TO TROUBLE SPOTS OF MOUNT DARWIN, BEITBRIDGE, AND GOKWE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN NOTED THAT A TEAM OF FOUR PEOPLE FROM </p><p>THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT HAD ARRIVED IN HARARE THE PREVIOUS DAY </p><p>AS THE ADVANCE PARTY OF THE COMMONWEALTH OBSERVER MISSION.  WE HAD </p><p>BEEN TOLD BY JOHN SHEPPARD, THE LEADER OF THE ADVANCE GROUP, THAT </p><p>SIX OBSERVERS WOULD ARRIVE BY FEBRUARY 11 AND THAT THE ENTIRE </p><p>DELEGATION OF 30 OBSERVERS AND 15 SUPPORT STAFF WOULD BE IN PLACE </p><p>BY FEBRUARY 23.  THE AMBASSADOR QUESTIONED WHETHER SUCH A </p><p>DELEGATION MIGHT BE TOO SMALL TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT AND </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THE UK MIGHT ASSIST IN PROVIDING FUNDS TO BEEF UP THE </p><p>SIZE.  POCOCK WAS NOT SURE, BUT REPORTED THAT THE COMMONWEALTH </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL HAD CIRCULATED A LETTER TO MEMBERS REQUESTING </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF 400,000 POUNDS TO FINANCE THE COSTS OF THE </p><p>OBSERVER DELEGATION.  WHILE SOME EARLY COMMONWEALTH OBSERVERS ARE </p><p>ON THE GROUND, WE HEARD FROM THE NIGERIAN HC THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>CONTINUE PLAYING FOR TIME, INSISTING THAT THE NIGERIAN MEMBER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00343  01 OF 02  071428Z </p><p>THE OBSERVATION MISSION MAY NOT COME UNTIL THE LETTER OF INVITATION </p><p>IS RECEIVED IN COMMONWEALTH HEADQUARTERS, A DELIVERY WHICH IS </p><p>REGULARLY DELAYED, </p><p> </p><p>MDC\'S PROSPECTS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) POCOCK SAID TSVANGIRAI SEEMED GENUINELY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT </p><p>HIS CHANCES OF UNSEATING PRESIDENT MUGABE.  HE REPORTEDLY BELIEVES </p><p>THE MDC HAS GAINED SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT IN THE ZANU-PF STRONGHOLDS </p><p>OF MASHONALAND -- PARTLY A PRODUCT OF INTENSIVE LOBBYING OF THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL LEADERS IN THAT REGION.  TSVANGIRAI SAID HE THOUGHT THE </p><p>MDC COULD WIN AS MANY AS HALF THE VOTES IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL </p><p>PROVINCE AND IN THE LOW 40 PERCENT RANGE IN MASHONALAND EAST. </p><p>(NOTE:  THOSE FIGURES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S SPECIAL ADVISOR -- SEE REFTEL.  END NOTE.)  CEPHAS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MSIPA, GOVERNOR OF MIDLANDS PROVINCE, PREDICTED TO OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS THAT THE MDC WOULD LIKELY WIN MIDLANDS.  (COMMENT: </p><p>MSIPA\'S PREDICTION IS REMARKABLE FOR TWO REASONS:  THE GOVERNOR IS </p><p>A SENIOR OFFICAL IN ZANU-PF, AND THE RULING PARTY WON 62 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE VOTE IN MIDLANDS IN THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.

END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IN A SEPARATE MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR ON FEBRUARY 5, </p><p>COLTART, WHO HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN A PESSIMIST IN THE PAST, WAS QUITE </p><p>BUOYANT.  HE NOTED THAT THE MDC NOW HAD THE LIST OF 6 MILLION </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS, AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN 700,000 FROM TWO YEARS </p><p>AGO, THEREBY OBVIATING EARLIER FEARS THAT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF </p><p>VOTERS HAD BEEN DISENFRANCHISED AND INDICATING A HIGH INTENTION TO </p><p>VOTE.  COLTART STATED THAT THE SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE </p><p>DISENFRANCHISED FOR DUAL CITIZENSHIP WAS COMPARATIVELY </p><p>INSIGNIFICANT.  THE MDC WAS UNDERTAKING TO DELIVER ITS CAMPAIGN </p><p>MATERIAL TO EACH OF THE SIX MILLION REGISTERED VOTERS. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO AN MDC GOVERNMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  WITH HIS BRITISH INTERLOCUTORS, THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT AN </p><p>MDC GOVERNMENT WOULD FACE A RANGE OF SERIOUS CHALLENGES AND WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT-TERM.  HE NOTED THAT THE USG HAS DONE </p><p>SOME THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN RESPOND QUICKLY TO A NEW MDC </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S MOST CRITICAL NEEDS AND ASKED WHETHER THE UK HAS </p><p>ENGAGED IN A SIMILAR PROCESS.  DONNELLY NOTED THAT THE MDC HAS </p><p>IDENTIFIED FIVE PRIORITY AREAS FOR ATTENTION DURING THE TRANSITION </p><p>PERIOD:  SECURITY; THE ECONOMY; SOCIAL REHABILITATION (INCLUDING </p><p>HIV/AIDS); GOOD GOVERNANCE (INCLUDING JUDICIAL REFORM, WALKING BACK </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S MORE REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION, AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM); </p><p>AND LAND REFORM (ALTHOUGH THIS LATTER POINT, TSVANGIRAI TOLD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00343  02 OF 02  071428Z </p><p>DONNELLY, IS THE LEAST URGENT OF THE FIVE).  POCOCK SAID THE UK IS </p><p>LOOKING AT HOW IT COULD QUICKLY BOOST DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE "BACK </p><p>TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE." IN ADDITION, THE UK IS PRESSING THE IFI\'S </p><p>TO BE PREPARED TO RESPOND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE EU TO BE </p><p>RESPONSIVE "UNDER THE COTONOU AGREEMENT."  (NOTE:  PRESUMABLY THE </p><p>LATTER POINT REFERS TO A RESTORATION OF SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE </p><p>LEVELS AND TRADE PRIVILEGES.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
