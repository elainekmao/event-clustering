<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003181 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, MARR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SEEBRIG ASSURANCES: GOT STRESSES ITS SIGNATURE TO </p><p>AGREEMENT IS FORTHCOMING </p><p> </p><p> (U)  Classified by Political-Military Counselor Stuart </p><p>Brown.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C)  On May 12 and 14, Polmiloff spoke with MFA NATO </p><p>Department Second Secretary Oya Ergin to inquire about the </p><p>status of Turkey\'s anticipated signature of the SEEBRIG </p><p>Assurances.  She informed us that everything is on track and </p><p>that "normal procedures" are in process.  The paper work is </p><p>currently in the Prime Minister\'s office, awaiting his </p><p>signature for approval.  Polmiloff pressed her to accelerate </p><p>the process, indicating that Washington as well as other </p><p>participants of the Communication Information System (CIS) </p><p>for SEEBRIG are becoming increasingly anxious that deadlines </p><p>will not be met if Turkey does not immediately sign the </p><p>agreement.  Ergin assured us that Turkey views the CIS as </p><p>extremely important and has no problems with the agreement. </p><p>She then continued to say that "it would be wrong to push the </p><p>Prime Ministry or the TGS at this point as they have just </p><p>received the paperwork."   She said she is hopeful the </p><p>process will be completed shortly.  Polmiloff said she would </p><p>convey this message to the Department, but that many in </p><p>Washington were beginning to question Turkey\'s commitment to </p><p>this project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
