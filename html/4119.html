TRIVELLI/PIERCE E-MAIL 10/25 </p><p> </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 2928 </p><p>     C. TEGUCIGALPA 1342 </p><p>     D. TEGUCIGALPA 1298 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Chief Francisco Palmieri; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On October 24-25 several thousand demonstrators that </p><p>included the loose political alliance known as the Popular </p><p>Block, the labor union SITRASANAA, secondary teachers </p><p>(COPEMH), and three Democratic Unification Party (UD) </p><p>congressmen clashed with police in violent demonstrations </p><p>that included the reported use of Molotov cocktails.  The </p><p>demonstrators protested against a number of issues, including </p><p>the pay packages for teachers and other workers, the possible </p><p>purchase of GOH housing bonds by teachers\' pension funds, the </p><p>installation of fences outside the entrances to Congress, and </p><p>opposition to proposed GOH policies on municipal water, </p><p>forests, and education as well as proposed regional free </p><p>trade agreements. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Demonstrators threw rocks at police vehicles, ripped </p><p>down the Congressional fences, and damaged vehicles and </p><p>private businesses, including a Pizza Hut restaurant.  Police </p><p>were forced to use tear gas, fire hoses, and rubber bullets </p><p>against the demonstrators outside of Congress, and several </p><p>policemen, demonstrators, and journalists were injured.  Only </p><p>two protesters were arrested.  Embassy security company </p><p>Inter-Con confirmed that gang members were also among the </p><p>demonstrators.  It is not known if their presence was </p><p>organized or opportunistic. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The demonstrations came on the heels of the October 23 </p><p>approval by a divided Congress to revise the teachers\' </p><p>statute to codify the May accords between primary school </p><p>teachers and the GOH.  The May agreement provides for a 12 </p><p>percent salary increase and delinks teacher salaries from the </p><p>minimum wage, thereby ending a key but controversial </p><p>provision in a 1997 law which generously indexed teachers\' </p><p>pay to five times the minimum wage (refs C and D).  President </p><p>Ricardo Maduro\'s National Party supported the bill, which was </p><p>opposed by the Liberal Party, Party of Innovation and </p><p>National Unity (PINU), and UD.  Secondary school teachers </p><p>continue to demand the 40 percent increase provided under the </p><p>original 1997 statute.  In September the Supreme Court ruled </p><p>that the part of the teachers\' statute that linked teacher </p><p>salaries to minimum wage was unconstitutional, which </p><p>observers had thought would set the stage for wrapping up the </p><p>strike.  The secondary school teachers pledge to continue </p><p>their protests and to strike until their demands are met. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The demonstrations followed an October 11 </p><p>demonstration outside the Embassy (ref B), and a string of </p><p>false bomb threats in the country, including one on October </p><p>23 at the Congress.  There are reports of another possible </p><p>Popular Block demonstration October 30 against the IMF and </p><p>proposed GOH privatization policies. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Minister of the Presidency Luis Cosenza termed the </p><p>protesters actions "vandalism" and Minister of Public </p><p>Security Oscar Alvarez said that the GOH would maintain a </p><p>"firm hand" against violent demonstrators.  President Maduro, </p><p>in a speech to the nation October 28, pledged that the GOH </p><p>would not back down in the face of violent protests.  Maduro </p><p>specifically defended the GOH\'s decision to provide up to </p><p>30,000 lempiras (USD 1,818) in subsidies for a low income </p><p>family to buy a house.  While open to dialogue, Maduro said </p><p>that this openness should not be confused with weakness nor </p><p>fear. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT:  Unlike the tame October 11 demonstration, </p><p>the GOH has reason to be worried about this violent turn of </p><p>events.  Notwithstanding their public belief and private </p><p>comments that these protests are being orchestrated to </p><p>undermine the Maduro government, many leading GOH officials </p><p>acknowledge that there are even tougher times ahead.  A </p><p>pending agreement to negotiate with the IMF, approval of the </p><p>2003 austerity budget, the next round of minimum wage </p><p>negotiations - all could serve to spark further public unrest. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  President Maduro called WHA/CEN </p><p>Director Trivelli October 25 and told him that the </p><p>demonstrations were disturbing and that the protesters\' use </p><p>of Molotov cocktails was a particularly bad sign. Maduro said </p><p>he suspected Liberal Party agitation was behind the </p><p>demonstrations, citing in particular Jorge Arturo Reina, who </p><p>was quoted in the press calling the teachers\' law a "blow" to </p><p>the constitution.  Maduro\'s advisors also acknowledge that </p><p>elements of their own party are fomenting some of the unrest. </p><p> Post believes that there remains a larger untapped sentiment </p><p>of discontent in the country.  However, historically the </p><p>Honduran public has been lethargic and apathetic about </p><p>demanding public policy changes.  The Maduro government </p><p>should be able to manage the situation if it continues to act </p><p>decisively and to demonstrate its engagement.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
