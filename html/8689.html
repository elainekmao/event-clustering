<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001506 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, PARM, MNUC, IR, NL, IAEA </p><p>SUBJECT: IAEA/IRAN:  FOLLOW-UP DEMARCHE WITH DUTCH ON IRAN </p><p>AT IAEA BOARD MEETING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 158048 </p><p> </p><p>     B. DEAN-KESSLER STUIII FAX </p><p>     C. THE HAGUE 1434 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DANIEL RUSSEL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B AN </p><p>D D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) AMBASSADOR MADE REF A DEMARCHE TO DUTCH MFA POLITICAL </p><p>DIRECTOR HUGO SIBLESZ ON JUNE 12.  SIBLESZ SAID HE SAW NO GAP </p><p>BETWEEN U.S. AND DUTCH VIEWS ON IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, ONLY </p><p>A DIFFERENCE OVER TACTICS.  THE DUTCH PREFERENCE FOR THE JUNE </p><p>16 IAEA BOARD OF GOVERNORS\' MEETING IS FOR SOME FORM OF </p><p>CHAIRMAN\'S CONCLUSIONS AS OPPOSED TO A RESOLUTION, WHICH </p><p>"LEAVES NO OTHER EXIT THAN REFERENCE TO THE UNSC."  THE </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THOSE CONCLUSIONS ARE LARGELY THE SAME (THAT IRAN </p><p>HAS A NUMBER OF NONCOMPLIANCE PROBLEMS, THAT THERE ARE A </p><p>RANGE OF QUESTIONS IRAN MUST ANSWER, THAT IRAN SHOULD SIGN UP </p><p>TO AN ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL).  SIBLESZ NOTED THAT IRAN WOULD BE </p><p>ON THE AGENDA FOR THE JUNE 16 EU FOREIGN MINISTERS\' MEETING </p><p>AND THAT THE NETHERLANDS SEEKS A STRONG MESSAGE OUT OF THAT </p><p>EVENT.  GIVEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS BELIEVES THAT THE EU SHOULD DELAY ITS CURRENT </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS ON A TRADE AND COOPERATION AGREEMENT (TCA) WITH </p><p>IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ACTING POLCOUNS ALSO REVIEWED REF A WITH MFA ACTING </p><p>NONPROLIFERATION DIRECTOR PETER POTMAN (PROTECT).  POTMAN </p><p>SHARED A COPY OF A NONPAPER THAT THE IRANIAN AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS HAD RECENTLY PRESENTED TO THE DUTCH MFA </p><p>(CONVEYED TO NP/RA PER REF B) JUSTIFYING THE IRANIAN PROGRAM, </p><p>AND STATING IRAN WOULD ACCEPT ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL IN EXCHANGE </p><p>FOR GUARANTEES OF AN END TO "ALL PROPAGANDA ABOUT IRAN\'S </p><p>NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND RESTRICTIONS AGAINST IRAN\'S FULL ACCESS </p><p>TO NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES."  POTMAN SAID </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS THOUGHT THE BOARD SHOULD UNITE BEHIND </p><p>CHAIRMAN ELBARADEI\'S REPORT, EXPRESS ITS CONCERN, CALL ON </p><p>IRAN TO COOPERATE FULLY, AND FOR THE IAEA TO FURTHER </p><p>INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
