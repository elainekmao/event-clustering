FOR INL/LP, DRL/PHD, WHA/CEN, AND INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PGOV, KCRM, KJUS, PHUM, PINR, PREL, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MUSICAL CHAIRS:  WHO\'S WHO IN HONDURAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>COUNTERNARCOTICS LEADERSHIP POSITIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires, a.i., Roger Pierce; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Several high-profile Honduran </p><p>counternarcotics agencies are receiving a leadership </p><p>makeover.  Gustavo Alfredo ((Landaverde)) Hernandez is </p><p>leaving the Executive Secretary position at the National </p><p>Council Against Narcotrafficking (CNCN), and has been </p><p>replaced by the Direction in the Fight Against </p><p>Narcotrafficking (DLCN) Acting Director Ofelia Margarita </p><p>((Gutierrez)) Gonzalez.  In turn, taking Gutierrez\'s place at </p><p>the DLCN will be retired Army Brigadier General Julian </p><p>Aristides ((Gonzalez)) Irias.  Profiled below are the key </p><p>players in these counternarcotics organizations.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Gustavo Alfredo ((Landaverde)) Hernandez </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Landaverde was the Executive Secretary of the </p><p>National Council Against Narcotrafficking (CNCN) until April </p><p>30.  Landaverde, a Liberal party member, was dismissed due to </p><p>ongoing public disagreements with the Nationalist Maduro </p><p>Administration over counternarcotics policy.  A specific </p><p>example was his criticism of Vice President Armida Lopez </p><p>Contreras regarding her decision to leave her deputy, Manuel </p><p>Euceda, in office after his indictment on fraud charges. </p><p>Landaverde has a long-standing political career in Honduras </p><p>and is an intelligent and outspoken person.  He was one of </p><p>the founding members of the Honduran Christian Democratic </p><p>Party (PDCH) and served as its President at one time. </p><p>Landaverde also served in Congress while a member of the </p><p>PDCH, before becoming a Liberal Party member.  He remains a </p><p>close contact of the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Ofelia Margarita ((Gutierrez)) Gonzalez </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  In March 2000 Gutierrez began her work with the </p><p>Direction in the Fight Against Narcotrafficking (DLCN), an </p><p>office which reports to the Attorney General, as Sub Director </p><p>under Fidel Omar ((Borjas)) Flores, and later Wilfredo </p><p>Alvarado.  Gutierrez has been the Acting Director since </p><p>Alvarado left the DLCN in September 2002.  With Landaverde\'s </p><p>April 30 departure from the CNCN, she is also serving as the </p><p>acting Executive Secretary of that organization.  Gutierrez </p><p>graduated with a bachelor\'s degree from the Honduran National </p><p>University (UNAH) in 1994 and obtained a law degree from UNAH </p><p>April 30, 2002.  Gutierrez has a legal background and worked </p><p>as a legal counsel at the National Preventative Police (PNP). </p><p> She is the widow of a police officer who died in the line of </p><p>duty.  While she has not been particularly effective as </p><p>Acting Director of the DLCN in mounting narcotics </p><p>investigations, she has been cooperative and honest in </p><p>implementing U.S. assistance projects, such as our maritime </p><p>and canine units. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Julian Aristides ((Gonzalez)) Irias </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Brigadier General Gonzalez, the new Director of the </p><p>DLCN, is a 30-year military veteran with numerous awards and </p><p>decorations.  Although in the past there were media </p><p>allegations of corruption related to the military pension </p><p>fund, throughout his military career General Gonzalez </p><p>developed a reputation as a competent, results-oriented but </p><p>stern and demanding field commander.  Prior to his mandatory </p><p>retirement on December 11, 2002, General Gonzalez served as </p><p>Special Assistant to Minister of Defense Federico Breve </p><p>Travieso.  In July 1998 Gonzalez was named Deputy Minister of </p><p>Defense in a controversial appointment.  His predecessor was </p><p>suddenly removed from office by General Mario Hung Pacheco </p><p>without approval or consultation with then President Carlos </p><p>Flores.  There were allegations that Pacheco used this </p><p>appointment to advance officials considered close to him.  A </p><p>succession of promotions for Gonzalez continued as follows: </p><p>July 1999 to Vice Chief of Joint Staff where he ran the </p><p>day-to-day operations of the HOAF and then October 2001 to </p><p>General. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Born in La Ceiba, Honduras on February 24, 1952; he </p><p>is married to Leslie Ondina Portillo Andino with whom he has </p><p>one daughter.  His resume boasts of extensive military </p><p>education and training in Taiwan and at the School of the </p><p>Americas in the U.S.  Areas of study include airborne </p><p>training, national security, anti-terrorism, and crisis </p><p>management.  He holds Engineering and History degrees from </p><p>the Honduran National University (UNAH) and has studied </p><p>International Relations and Diplomacy at the Catholic </p><p>University.  Gonzalez speaks Spanish, English, and Portuguese. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Gonzalez brings some baggage to the position (he was </p><p>particularly dogmatic while in the military that the Armed </p><p>Forces did not have Constitutional authority to carry out </p><p>counternarcotics activities).  However, Post is hopeful that </p><p>Gonzalez will bring order and enhanced command and control to </p><p>what has been an ineffective law enforcement agency.  In </p><p>order to do this, he will have to clean house in the DLCN. </p><p>Gonzalez brings to the DLCN a strong operational background </p><p>and superb organizational skills.  He also will benefit from </p><p>the essential contacts within the Ministries of Defense and </p><p>Public Security that he holds.  Post supported his </p><p>appointment for exactly this reason and with the hope that he </p><p>might bring the zeal of a convert to the nation\'s </p><p>counternarcotics efforts.  However, he will face strong </p><p>resistance from the leadership of the Public Ministry that </p><p>preferred an insider for the position of DLCN Director. </p><p>Currently, more than 80 percent of the DLCN budget goes to </p><p>personnel costs.  Gonzalez will have to change this ratio if </p><p>he hopes to be successful.  If Gonzalez fails to invigorate </p><p>the DLCN, it could be on the chopping block for elimination </p><p>when a new Attorney General is appointed in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Embassy Thoughts on the Changes </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  COMMENT:  Post was not surprised to see Landaverde </p><p>ousted at the CNCN and is not particularly enthused with </p><p>Gutierrez as his replacement.  Landaverde was often a </p><p>solitary voice, praising the recent INCSR report and </p><p>disputing official GOH criticism of the USG counternarcotics </p><p>assistance.  He was an excellent source on the Honduran </p><p>counternarcotics community.  As noted, Gonzalez may be the </p><p>last (somewhat) best hope for the DLCN, which has become a </p><p>major disappointment to the Embassy.  Post is increasingly </p><p>focusing counternarcotics cooperation on the Frontier Police </p><p>due to the ineffectiveness of the DLCN. Only new vigorous </p><p>leadership at the DLCN might be able to reverse this new </p><p>Embassy focus.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
