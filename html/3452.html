<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001441 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL; NSC </p><p>FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08-06-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, PREL, CE, Elections, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Government and president headed for a </p><p>showdown, with a snap election possible </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 08-05-02 telecon </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 1433, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  President Kumaratunga and Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe are headed for a showdown.  In </p><p>an August 5 conversation with the Ambassador, G.L. </p><p>Peiris, a senior minister, said the GSL plans to demand </p><p>that Kumaratunga agree to a constitutional provision </p><p>voiding her right to call a parliamentary election.  If </p><p>she does not agree, the GSL plans to call snap polls </p><p>now.  One factor that apparently precipitated the </p><p>government\'s decision to force a showdown was its belief </p><p>that Kumaratunga was about to hatch an elaborate plan to </p><p>topple the PM.  Our assessment is that an election would </p><p>prove disruptive for the peace process.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Headed for a Showdown </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) As foreshadowed in Ref B, the tense cohabitation </p><p>relationship between President Kumaratunga and Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe is headed for a showdown.  In an </p><p>August 5 conversation with the Ambassador, G.L. Peiris, </p><p>a senior minister, said the GSL is planning to demand </p><p>that Kumaratunga agree to a constitutional provision </p><p>voiding her right to call a parliamentary election. </p><p>(Note:  Per her constitutional prerogatives, the </p><p>president could call for a new election at any point one </p><p>year after the last election, which took place in </p><p>December 2001.)  She must also agree not to take </p><p>punitive action against MPs of her party who support the </p><p>GSL\'s bill on this issue.  If she does not agree to </p><p>these terms, the GSL plans to call snap polls now. </p><p>(Note:  An election would take place about six weeks to </p><p>two months after being called.  The rough contours of </p><p>Peiris\' comments to the Ambassador regarding the </p><p>possibility of snap polls were published in daily </p><p>newspapers on August 6 in blaring headlines.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Peiris said the PM will present this ultimatum </p><p>to former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a key </p><p>associate of Kumaratunga\'s, late August 6, and request </p><p>that Kumraratunga reply in short order.  In doing so, </p><p>Peiris noted that the PM will stress that if she agrees </p><p>to the above points he will instruct his United National </p><p>Front (UNF) party members to tone down criticism of her </p><p>and her People\'s Alliance (PA) party. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The decision to press for a showdown was not </p><p>easily taken, Peiris remarked.  Key figures in the UNF </p><p>government, including PM Wickremesinghe, had met late </p><p>August 5 and come to the decision only after extensive </p><p>debate, including frantic talks throughout the weekend. </p><p>The general feeling from all shades of party opinion -- </p><p>not only from diehard opponents of Kumaratunga\'s -- was </p><p>that the UNF had to do something to constrain her now </p><p>because the current situation was not sustainable.  In </p><p>particular, a memo purportedly prepared by the PA that </p><p>was leaked to the press and published on August 4 had </p><p>deeply worried the UNF, as it set out a near-term plan </p><p>to topple Wickremesinghe\'s government (see more below). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) When asked, Peiris replied that he thought an </p><p>election was "likely" and he predicted that the UNF </p><p>could pick up 12-15 seats.  Such a gain would give the </p><p>UNF a commanding position in Parliament vis-a-vis the </p><p>president, he felt.  That said, it was possible that </p><p>Kumaratunga might agree to the terms proffered or </p><p>perhaps try to negotiate a different solution.  Many </p><p>members of her party did not want an election, fearing </p><p>they would lose their seats.  Their views might have an </p><p>affect on her.  The UNF would carefully review her </p><p>response in any case.  The Ambassador underscored that </p><p>the U.S. continued to urge both sides to show restraint </p><p>and not to divert focus from key issues, such as the </p><p>peace process and economic reforms. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Purported PA Memo Stirs Debate </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) As noted by Peiris and touched on in Ref B, one </p><p>of the recent events that have apparently galvanized the </p><p>GSL to action involves a memo allegedly drafted by the </p><p>PA and then leaked to the press.  The memo sets out a </p><p>scheme in which the PA topples Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe and then forms a government headed by </p><p>former Foreign Minister Kadirgamar.  The memo is </p><p>somewhat lurid, with sentences like, "We must plan a </p><p>constitutional coup using executive powers to the </p><p>maximum..." and "A case must be built rapidly against </p><p>the present PM facilitating his removal from office, </p><p>enabling the president to appoint a PM of her choice." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) The exact provenance of the memo is unclear. </p><p>The UNF has been shouting from the ramparts that it is </p><p>evidence of a "plot" by the PA and Peiris told the </p><p>Ambassador that the document was "spirited away" from </p><p>the desk of Mangala Sameeraweera, a senior PA MP.  For </p><p>its part, the PA has denied all involvement, with </p><p>Kadirgamar stating that he knows not a wit about it and </p><p>that his name was taken in vain. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) We doubt that Kumaratunga will react well to an </p><p>ultimatum designed to limit her powers.  The GSL seems </p><p>serious, however, and a snap election appears to be a </p><p>real possibility.  There has been a slew of editorials </p><p>urging the two sides to ratchet down the rhetoric and it </p><p>is still possible that cooler heads will prevail.  It\'s </p><p>important that that happens.  With Colombo fixated on </p><p>its domestic machinations, little attention is being </p><p>paid to crucial issues, such as the peace process and </p><p>economic reforms.  An election would prove even more </p><p>disruptive, especially because the GSL is now closely </p><p>engaged in the sensitive process of trying to set up </p><p>negotiations with the Tigers later this year.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
