<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000240 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, VM, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  VVAF AND MOD SIGN HISTORIC AGREEMENT TO CONDUCT </p><p>LANDMINE/UXO SURVEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Another small, but historic step in the bilateral </p><p>relationship took place in Hanoi on January 27, when the </p><p>Ministry of Defense (MOD) signed an MOU for a survey of </p><p>landmines and UXO with the Vietnam Veterans of America </p><p>Foundation.  The Director of Defense Ministry\'s Demining </p><p>Command (BOMICO), Senior Colonel Bui Minh Tam, signed for </p><p>MOD, and David Holdridge, VVAF Country Representative and a </p><p>veteran, signed for the United States.  DCM and DATT </p><p>attended. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Department\'s Humanitarian Demining Program (HDP) </p><p>set aside $6 million for the Vietnam Level-One survey, </p><p>formally known as the Vietnam Landmine/UXO Impact Assessment </p><p>and Survey Project.  It includes data collection, field </p><p>surveys to verify the data, and data analysis.  Phase one of </p><p>the survey will last 12 months and cover the provinces of </p><p>Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Ha Tinh, all in central Vietnam. </p><p>Phase two will include other contaminated provinces and </p><p>occur after both parties review the results of phase one. </p><p>Results will be consolidated into narrative reports and </p><p>digital maps.  VVAF will implement the project on behalf of </p><p>the Department. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The GVN-controlled local press gave the signing </p><p>ceremony good coverage, another sign of the significance of </p><p>the event for the GVN.  This followed in the wake of two </p><p>\'prep\' articles that were published last week in the Army </p><p>Newspaper and Vietnam News.  At the annual meeting between </p><p>the Committee for Foreign NGO Affairs and Foreign NGOs, </p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Le Van Bang interrupted his 25- </p><p>minute prepared speech to speak extemporaneously in support </p><p>of the groundbreaking signing.  At the same event, the </p><p>President of the Vietnam Union of Friendship Organizations, </p><p>Mr. Vu Xuan Hong, also specifically focused on the signing, </p><p>stating that he very much appreciated the understanding, </p><p>determination and patience of VVAF and that this was a very </p><p>important event. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Comment:  Negotiations on the MOU began in May 2001 </p><p>and took a long 20 months, stalled in part on GVN/PAVN </p><p>sensitivities over where the survey would be conducted and </p><p>the need for it to avoid sensitive border areas.  Agreement </p><p>to sign the MOU clearly came from the top of the GVN and </p><p>Communist Party.  Negotiations over phase two of the project </p><p>could also be difficult.  Nonetheless, the fact that the MOD </p><p>and an American veterans organization could reach agreement </p><p>to sign the MOU is another positive sign for US-Vietnam </p><p>relations and, hopefully, help reduce the lingering </p><p>suspicion caused by the war.   The event also marks the </p><p>first time that the Defense Ministry has signed an agreement </p><p>with an NGO.  BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
