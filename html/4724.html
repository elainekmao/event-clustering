<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 003313 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/10/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, SOCI, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA--AN IMPEACHMENT POST-MORTEM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD JETER. </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (B) & (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Roughly a month has passed since the </p><p>impeachment threat against Obasanjo was effectively </p><p>shelved; however, its repercussions continue to be </p><p>felt throughout the Nigerian polity. President </p><p>Obasanjo has been made painfully aware of his </p><p>electoral vulnerabilities, and is trying to </p><p>dramatically change his political style.   With the </p><p>PDP convention less than three weeks away, he seems to </p><p>have done more politicking and outreach in the past </p><p>month than all the previous months of the year put </p><p>together. A gradual d ente between Obasanjo and his </p><p>Vice President would enhance re-nomination prospects </p><p>and one appears to be emerging. Most insiders report </p><p>Atiku has decided to cast his lot with Obasanjo. </p><p>Nevertheless, opponents were encouraged by the </p><p>impeachment drama. Other PDP candidates have emerged, </p><p>Second Republic Vice President Alex Ekweume being the </p><p>most formidable. Outside the PDP, the ANPP is </p><p>canvassing the Southeast in search of a Southeast- </p><p>North presidential ticket to oppose Obasanjo. The </p><p>impeachment battle further accentuated regional </p><p>politics and exposed latent fissures in the National </p><p>Assembly. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>President Obasanjo - Wounded and Wary </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The impeachment threat against Obasanjo was </p><p>doused because of the sustained intervention of PDP </p><p>party officials and former Heads of State Yakubu Gowon </p><p>and Shehu Shagari. Even with the intercession of these </p><p>former leaders, the settlement cost Obasanjo more than </p><p>just his political standing and embarrassment. After </p><p>acting dismissively toward the National Assembly for </p><p>three years, he was compelled to assent to Assembly </p><p>demands, inter alia, to increase spending on capital </p><p>projects while also suspending the controversial </p><p>privatization sales of rickety Nigerian Airways and </p><p>the National Mint Company. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) True, ending the impeachment threat </p><p>temporarily decreased the level of political suspense </p><p>but did little to erase underlying tensions that led </p><p>to the move in the first place. In reality, the </p><p>impeachment threat was nothing more than the </p><p>continuation of electoral politics by other means. </p><p>Thus, while escaping this challenge, Obasanjo was in </p><p>position to revel his survival.  More than any other </p><p>event during his Presidency, the impeachment showed </p><p>Obasanjo the limits of presidential power and the </p><p>depths of his unpopularity among the political elite, </p><p>including those in his own party.  Obasanjo was unable </p><p>to repel the threat unilaterally. He needed the </p><p>intervention of Gowon and Shagari to pacify the </p><p>maverick PDP-dominated Assembly.  Smugly ensconced in </p><p>the lap of incumbency, Obasanjo had been guilty of </p><p>hubris up to this point. Now he has taken on the </p><p>contrite posture of a man who needed the help of Good </p><p>Samaritans and passers-by to squelch a house fire </p><p>willfully ignited by his own relatives, i.e. PDP </p><p>National Assembly Members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Some of the support Obasanjo received during </p><p>the impeachment was double-edged, however. As </p><p>individuals and groups stood up to criticize the </p><p>impeachment challenge, some Obasanjo advisors thought </p><p>they could turn this to his electoral advantage. Their </p><p>mistake was assuming a tight correlation between </p><p>opposition to impeachment and support for reelection. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, membership in the former group </p><p>was larger than the latter.  Several groups, including </p><p>the Nigeria Bar Association and the "Patriots" group </p><p>issued public statements opposing impeachment but </p><p>endorsing a constitutional amendment for a five-year </p><p>term for the President and Governors.  These public </p><p>statements particularly hurt; both groups have strong </p><p>Yoruba contingents and are dominated by Southerners. </p><p>The most important Yoruba social group, "Afenifere," </p><p>also opposed impeachment but was non-committal on </p><p>Obasanjo\'s reelection. At least, the Bar Association </p><p>and "Afenifere" members agreed to meet the President. </p><p>"Ohaneze Ndigbo," the pre-eminent Igbo political </p><p>organization, not only asked Obasanjo to step aside, </p><p>they refused his invitation to meet. In a protocol </p><p>conscious society, that rebuff was almost </p><p>unprecedented.  Instead of meeting Obasanjo as a </p><p>group, Ohaneze sent former Biafran leader Ojukwu to </p><p>talk to the President, symbolically a jab at Obasanjo, </p><p>who, as a general, had led the defeat of Ojukwu and </p><p>his Biafran succession. ("Ohaneze" claims the </p><p>objective of an Igbo President is sine qua non for </p><p>2003. For them, there is no way the Yoruba Obasanjo </p><p>can change his ethnic stripes.) </p><p>5. (C) Comment: Obasanjo is especially indebted to </p><p>Gowon and Shagari for their roles in ending the </p><p>impeachment drive.  However, the President would </p><p>rather not be indebted to these two Northern </p><p>stalwarts. In the public eye, they could hold a </p><p>special leverage over him. He would be very sensitive </p><p>to a call from either or both for him to step down. </p><p>People would give their statements much more credence </p><p>since these men were allies who so recently and </p><p>energetically fought for Obasanjo. They would see any </p><p>negative reaction by Obasanjo to these statesmen as </p><p>symptomatic of a person afflicted with a stubborn lust </p><p>for office and power. Now with Alex Ekweume entering </p><p>the race, Obasanjo has to be concerned that Shagari </p><p>may ultimately be compelled to publicly support his </p><p>former Vice President. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The impeachment showed several weaknesses in </p><p>Obasanjo\'s Administration.  Few of his Cabinet </p><p>Ministers and others rose to his defense. Their </p><p>relative silence was resounding and demonstrated a </p><p>lack of deeply committed politically support. Second, </p><p>his public relations machinery was languid. His spin- </p><p>doctors seemed to suffer from professional anemia; </p><p>their passivity allowed the President\'s opponents to </p><p>control the media agenda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) However, all has not been gloomy for Obasanjo. </p><p>In fact, his stock is better than it was in mid- </p><p>November. Given the frenetic pace of events, the </p><p>effect of many of the negative public statements made </p><p>in November and October will have been dulled by the </p><p>January 3-5 PDP national convention.  Moreover, </p><p>Obasanjo has been actively politicking and has </p><p>replaced his general\'s scowl with a politician\'s </p><p>smile.  His triumphal visits to Osun, Oyo and Lagos </p><p>states created positive press, varnished his </p><p>Presidential patina and solidified his base in the </p><p>Southwest. He was buoyed by the public exclamation of </p><p>Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu that Obasanjo could </p><p>count as his the "5 million" voters in Lagos State. </p><p>Tinubu\'s statement indicates that Obasanjo must have </p><p>made electoral peace with the AD Governors of the </p><p>Southwest, presumably eliciting their support by </p><p>promising not to actively oppose their reelection.  If </p><p>so, Obasanjo has gone far in securing his Yoruba home </p><p>turf. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Obasanjo also formally jumpstarted his PDP re- </p><p>nomination campaign in Enugu, in the Igbo Southeast. </p><p>The symbolism could not be more apparent.  In doing </p><p>so, he was extending a hand in hopes of minimizing </p><p>Igbo defections from his camp.  (Igbos voted massively </p><p>for Obasanjo in the 1999 election.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT ATIKU: PERHAPS NOT SO EAGER TO BOLT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Governor Tinubu\'s endorsement of Obasanjo, if </p><p>genuine, would indicate Vice President Atiku was </p><p>having second thoughts about challenging his boss for </p><p>the PDP nomination. Tinubu and Atiku are close friends </p><p>and political allies albeit in different parties. </p><p>Tinubu probably would not have so extravagantly lauded </p><p>Obasanjo without a nod from Atiku. The Lagos </p><p>Governor\'s statement could be unmitigated flimflam; </p><p>however, that is unlikely.  Stooping to such a crass, </p><p>public deception would border the unconscionable even </p><p>by Nigeria\'s forgiving standards of political </p><p>misconduct. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) There is other evidence that Atiku does not </p><p>appear as eager to bolt as he did one month ago. </p><p>Realization of his own political liabilities might </p><p>have tempered the Vice-President\'s ambitions. </p><p>Moreover, several sources have informed us Obasanjo </p><p>recently confronted Atiku with a dossier of financial </p><p>improprieties to be made public should the Vice </p><p>President defect. Atiku apparently did not purchase a </p><p>presidential nomination application, a requisite to </p><p>contesting as PDP standard-bearer in the upcoming </p><p>convention. Although a Northerner, Atiku did not raise </p><p>a peep when the PDP announced that it had "zoned" the </p><p>presidency to the South, a move that would eliminate </p><p>him from contention.  He likely came to understand </p><p>that many "supporters" were trying to inveigle him, </p><p>hoping that an Obasanjo versus Atiku collision for the </p><p>PDP nomination would disable them both. Instead of </p><p>acting prematurely in the 2003 election, Atiku might </p><p>now think he should bide his time until 2007. One of </p><p>Atiku\'s fears has been that Obasanjo might dump him. </p><p>Reverend Yusuf Obaje, Obasanjo\'s Chaplain, told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter that recent conversations between </p><p>Atiku and Obasanjo have helped clear the air: If he </p><p>actively supports Obasanjo, Atiku will remain on the </p><p>ticket. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Obasanjo\'s olive leaf to Atiku was not the </p><p>product of altruism. Given the strength of Atiku\'s </p><p>position within the PDP and the Ekwueme\'s candidacy </p><p>(which surprised Obasanjo), Obasanjo needs Atiku more </p><p>than ever to be re-nominated. However, complete trust </p><p>between the two will be very difficult to restore. </p><p>Atiku and his supporters remain wary that Obasanjo </p><p>might retain him just long enough to win renomination, </p><p>then dump him. (Comment: This post-nomination ejection </p><p>seems unlikely as it would hurt Obasanjo in the </p><p>general election by splitting the party and further </p><p>undermine Obasanjo in the Northeast. Moreover, </p><p>Obasanjo\'s reputation for loyalty is already suspect; </p><p>dropping the Vice President after using him to win the </p><p>nomination would paint Obasanjo with the brush of </p><p>ruthlessness, undermining the dual image of reform and </p><p>new-found affability he is trying to convey.  End </p><p>comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Sensing that Obasanjo is wounded, several </p><p>candidates have emerged in the PDP, none more </p><p>formidable than current PDP Board of Trustees Chairman </p><p>and former Vice President Alex Ekweume.  That the </p><p>urbane Ekweume, a Southeastern Igbo, made his public </p><p>announcement from Minna, the home of former Heads of </p><p>State Babangida and Abdulsalaam, was symbolic.  It was </p><p>intended to convey that Ekweume, not Obasanjo, has the </p><p>backing of these two former leaders.  This is an </p><p>important omen to PDP watchers; if true, it represents </p><p>a change in fortunes from 1999 when Babangida\'s </p><p>intervention allowed Obasanjo to snatch the PDP </p><p>nomination from Ekweume\'s hands at the eleventh hour </p><p>of the party convention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. However, the fact that Babangida absented himself </p><p>from Minna the day of Ekweume\'s declaration might have </p><p>diluted the intended message, leaving everyone still </p><p>wondering about Babangida\'s intentions. Ironically, </p><p>Ekweume\'s candidacy might push some Igbos toward </p><p>Obasanjo. There are several younger Igbos who desire </p><p>to be Nigeria\'s First Citizen, but see 2007 or 2011 as </p><p>their dates with destiny. If Ekweume wins in 2003, </p><p>another Igbo might not get a chance to contest for the </p><p>presidency for nearly twenty years given the </p><p>predilection to "zone" offices among the six </p><p>geopolitical regions on a rotational basis. End </p><p>Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>THE ANPP: COURTING THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH-SOUTH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Meanwhile, the leading opposition party, the </p><p>ANPP, moved to capitalize on the anti-Obasanjo </p><p>sentiment exposed during the impeachment drama. </p><p>Ironically, the ANPP has been attempting to shed its </p><p>image as a Northern-dominated party by acknowledging </p><p>its Northern domination.  The party is using the </p><p>carrot of its solid support in the North to entice </p><p>politicians in the Southeast and South-South to </p><p>abandon the PDP.  Consequently, the ANPP held large </p><p>rallies in Port Harcourt (South-South) and Enugu </p><p>(Southeast) in late November.  Additionally, the ANPP </p><p>has been courting the leadership of "Ohaneze Ndigbo" </p><p>and various South-South groups, dangling before them </p><p>the possibility of a Southeast/North or a South- </p><p>South/North presidential ticket to oppose Obasanjo. </p><p>Moderate ANPP Northerners hope this tack of keeping </p><p>the Presidency in the South in 2003 would attract </p><p>anti-Obasanjo Southerners to the party. The presidency </p><p>would then be zoned to the North in 2007. This would </p><p>suit the likes of players like ANPP acting National </p><p>Chairman, Sokoto State Governor Bafarawa, who </p><p>reportedly have their eyes on the 2007 ANPP </p><p>nomination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The ANPP stands to gain defectors from PDP </p><p>National Assembly Members who openly endorsed </p><p>Obasanjo\'s impeachment. These PDP Members fear for </p><p>their careers should they remain in the PDP and </p><p>Obasanjo win re-nomination. Already, former Senate </p><p>President Okadigbo has bolted to the ANPP.  Current </p><p>Senate President Anyim and others have been </p><p>contemplating the move for months. They might find a </p><p>safe place to land in the ANPP.  Devoid of serious </p><p>candidates in many areas of the Southeast and South- </p><p>South, the ANPP has been offering many PDP office </p><p>holders the counterpart ANPP nominations if they </p><p>crossed the carpet.  In the final analysis, the ANPP </p><p>stands to gain numerous defections and win more </p><p>support in the Southeast and South-South unless </p><p>Obasanjo convinces mutinous National Assembly Members </p><p>that he will not act vindictively if he wins. For his </p><p>part, Ekwueme need to keep as many National Assembly </p><p>Members as possible in the PDP; he will need their </p><p>voted at the national convention where they are ex </p><p>officio delegates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>CHARGES AND COUNTER-CHARGES IN THE UPPER CHAMBER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) From the looks of things in the Senate, it </p><p>appears that Obasanjo is not very interested in </p><p>mending fences with the National Assembly leadership </p><p>and those members who advocated his ouster.  During </p><p>the impeachment drive, the Assembly leadership not </p><p>only attacked Obasanjo but also removed his real and </p><p>suspected supporters from key committee memberships. </p><p>Obasanjo supporters sought retribution through the </p><p>Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC).  A </p><p>House Member filed a petition against House Speaker </p><p>Na\'Abba for allegedly diverting government funds to </p><p>private purposes.  In a much more sensational move, </p><p>Senator Arthur Nzeribe filed a petition with ICPC </p><p>claiming he distributed over 300 million Naira to </p><p>Senators, including the Senate leadership, in bribes </p><p>to end the Obasanjo impeachment.  The amoral Nzeribe </p><p>filed the petition after being suspended from the </p><p>Senate when his attempt to impeachment Senate </p><p>President Anyim failed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Anyim and Na\'Abba rushed to court in late </p><p>November, obtaining injunctions to suspend the ICPC </p><p>investigations.  They also hurriedly established </p><p>special committees to consider repealing the ICPC </p><p>enabling legislation.  In an act of nearly </p><p>unparalleled shamelessness, the two lawmakers filed </p><p>suit to have the law establishing the ICPC declared </p><p>unconstitutional; this despite the fact that they were </p><p>the ones who shepherded the measure through their </p><p>respective Chambers. Sadly, the politicization of the </p><p>ICPC, which was to be the GON\'s anti-corruption </p><p>flagship, has been an unfortunate offshoot of the </p><p>impeachment machinations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>A RISE IN REGIONALISM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) While most of the intrigue has been among the </p><p>political elite, public psychology also has been </p><p>influenced. Perhaps the most noticeable consequence </p><p>has been the exacerbation of regional identification. </p><p>Part of the reason Obasanjo could solidify his base in </p><p>the Yoruba Southwest was that Yorubas saw impeachment </p><p>as an attempt by Northerners to snatch power not just </p><p>from Obasanjo but from them. Many non-Yoruba </p><p>Southerners also saw it as a Northern ploy to wrest </p><p>power. Yet, instead of rallying around Obasanjo, these </p><p>non-Yoruba measured Obasanjo\'s popularity, found it </p><p>wanting and sensed he could be defeated.  Thus, many </p><p>politicians in other areas of the South began to </p><p>clamor more loudly for a Southern President other than </p><p>Obasanjo.  In the North, the impeachment reinforced </p><p>negative views of Obasanjo held by large swaths of the </p><p>population.  The sense that the president was weakened </p><p>and susceptible to further embarrassment by his </p><p>opponents might also have indirectly encouraged the </p><p>instigators of the Kaduna and Abuja anti-Miss World </p><p>protests, and the rioting that ensued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) The impeachment and developments surrounding </p><p>it have brought the challenges to Obasanjo\'s re- </p><p>nomination into sharper focus. He has a better sense </p><p>of his allies, opportunistic straphangers, his enemies </p><p>and the questions that must be answered if his re- </p><p>nomination run is to be successful. Obasanjo was </p><p>clearly wounded by the impeachment. It was akin to </p><p>dropping a weight on the foot of an unsuspecting </p><p>sprinter as he approached the starting line. However, </p><p>the benefits and trappings of incumbency and his </p><p>influence over the electoral bodies make Obasanjo\'s </p><p>race to the finish line shorter than his opponents\'. </p><p>While he is far from a shoe-in, there is a sense that </p><p>he has rebounded to some extent.  If Obasanjo can </p><p>retain Atiku\'s allegiance and minimize Babangida\'s </p><p>dabbling in the PDP, he still has the inside track to </p><p>the nomination, albeit with the well-respected Ekweume </p><p>close on his heels. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
