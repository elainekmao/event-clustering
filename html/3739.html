<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 001734 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA, PRM/POP AND SA/INS </p><p>TREASURY FOR GEETHA RAO </p><p>MANILA FOR USADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAID, ECON, PHUM, MV, UNDP, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  UNDP AND UNFPA COUNTRY PROGRAMS FOR MALDIVES </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  STATE 175157 </p><p> </p><p>UNDP program </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  Post endorses UNDP country program for Maldives for 2003- </p><p>2007.  UNDP\'S overall objectives of reducing poverty and </p><p>disparities are in line with national priorities of </p><p>equitable development identified by the Government of the </p><p>Republic of Maldives (GORM) in its sixth national </p><p>development plan (6NDP) and 2020 vision.  Although Maldives </p><p>has seen rising per capita income, the data masks </p><p>significant disparities in income and development especially </p><p>in the outer atolls.  Therefore, the UNDP\'s focus on </p><p>development of the less privileged populations in the outer </p><p>islands, together with GORM programs and a proposed Regional </p><p>Development Project funded by the Asian Development Bank, </p><p>could make an appreciable difference in the lives of people </p><p>living in atolls. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNDP efforts to improve the focus and relevance of </p><p>income generating activities through micro credit will also </p><p>help meet a much needed requirement of the Maldives to find </p><p>employment avenues for the unemployed. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The UNDP resident representative plays a useful and </p><p>important role in coordinating UN system agencies; UNDP is </p><p>one of a few UN or international agencies with a physical </p><p>presence in Maldives. </p><p> </p><p>UNFPA program </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Post also supports the UNFPA country program for </p><p>Maldives, which focuses on the following areas: national </p><p>reproductive health program, access to reproductive health </p><p>services in atolls, adolescent sexual and reproductive </p><p>health, inter-sectoral collaboration in population and </p><p>development, community based initiatives for women\'s </p><p>empowerment, and the use of mass media in advocating gender </p><p>equality.  The focus of UNFPA programs is in line with </p><p>population sector priorities identified by the GORM in the </p><p>UNDP.  In particular, reproductive health programs are vital </p><p>for Maldives as a large portion of the population is still </p><p>below 30 and has the potential for a rapid expansion of </p><p>population.  The proposed program deals adequately with </p><p>Women\'s socio-economic status. </p><p> </p><p>5.  USAID has not been operating any programs in the </p><p>Maldives recently. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
