O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe\'s Ailing Economy: Where It Stands </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The Zimbabwean economy has plummeted </p><p>more than anyone thought possible, the curious tragedy of </p><p>a place that had all the right stuff - fertile land </p><p>packed with minerals, sophisticated infrastructure run by </p><p>well-educated populace, high-income tourist destinations </p><p>- now in disintegration.  As it stands in mid-2003, </p><p>meaningful policy shift is only imaginable after </p><p>political change.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Broad Picture </p><p>----------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Although statistics are sketchy, the formal </p><p>Zimbabwean economy has probably shed 40 percent, from </p><p>approximately US$ 7 to 4.3 billion.  Inflation is 365 </p><p>percent (year-on-year), real interest rates negative-300 </p><p>percent and the Zimdollar trading at 3350:US$1 (up 200- </p><p>fold from 17:1 in 1998).  Without Western food </p><p>assistance, most Zimbabweans would suffer severe </p><p>undernourishment. (U.S. food aid alone totaled US$ 115 </p><p>million last year, or about 3 percent of GDP.)  Perhaps 7- </p><p>8 percent of the population has emigrated.  The country\'s </p><p>infrastructure - education, transport, energy, </p><p>telecommunications, law enforcement - is in shambles. </p><p> </p><p>What Has Sustained It? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) First and foremost, indirect assistance from the </p><p>West, Libya, South Africa and emigrants has propped up a </p><p>teetering economy.  In addition to the West\'s food aid, </p><p>Libya\'s TAMOIL donated approximately US$ 350 million </p><p>through fuel in 2001-02 and South Africa\'s ESKOM close to </p><p>US$ 50 million through electricity since 2002 - all </p><p>without payment, or prospect thereof.  Remittances </p><p>account for annual inflows of US$ 500 million, according </p><p>to the local Western Union rep. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Secondly, there is a vibrant informal economy </p><p>not captured by official data.  Few companies do not </p><p>stray occasionally into this Neverneverland.  Motorists </p><p>now depend exclusively on informal fuel networks, and </p><p>dealing in scarce banknotes is but one of many lucrative </p><p>rent-seeking opportunities.  Almost everything for sale </p><p>in Zimbabwe is technically contraband, exceeding the </p><p>GOZ\'s whimsically-enforced and unrealistic price limits </p><p>(e.g., a US$.08 bread loaf or US$.12 liter of gas). </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Thirdly, many exporters are doing well </p><p>exploiting Zimbabwe\'s low-cost environment.  In </p><p>agriculture, this means cotton and horticulture (often </p><p>raised by increasingly efficient small-scale farmers); in </p><p>minerals, ferroalloys; in manufacturing, a real mixed </p><p>bag.  We have visited plants that successfully export </p><p>furniture, bus-windshields, khaki slacks and wooden doors </p><p>to the U.S.  Needless to say, exporters routinely shelter </p><p>foreign exchange earnings from the GOZ in off-shore </p><p>accounts. </p><p> </p><p>The Shrinking Economy </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU) The rest of the formal economy is in dismal </p><p>shape, however.  The cattle herd has been decimated. </p><p>Beneficiaries of land reform, which has dispossessed </p><p>about 4,000 white farmers, add little to the agricultural </p><p>output. The size of this year\'s tobacco harvest will be </p><p>80-90 million kgs, higher than initially expected but a </p><p>far cry from 1999 when Zimbabwean grew 237 million kgs </p><p>and led the world in exports.  The official press </p><p>recently acknowledged that farmers had sent to the Grain </p><p>Marketing Board only 33,500 out of this year\'s projected </p><p>930,000 tons of maize production. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Zimbabwe\'s once strong textile producers have </p><p>laid off 12,000 of 30,000 workers, losing countless </p><p>contracts to AGOA-qualified countries.  JCPenney and the </p><p>GAP have already left, and one local producer said he was </p><p>barely holding on to Target. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Zimbabwe\'s convoluted export policies, energy </p><p>rationing and erratic railway service have taken their </p><p>toll on mineral production.  Coal producer Wankie </p><p>Colliery is operating at 40 percent capacity.  Gold </p><p>production is down 50 percent since 1999, causing </p><p>Zimbabwe to fall from third to sixth in Sub-Saharan </p><p>rankings.  Investment in Zimbabwe\'s all-important </p><p>platinum reserves lags South Africa and Russia. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Finally, tourism is nearly lifeless.  Most high- </p><p>priced safari lodges remain empty.  And even domestic </p><p>tourism has been crippled by the gasoline scarcity. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>10. (SBU) It\'s doubtful the paralytic GOZ can address </p><p>more than one economic crisis at a time.  For the moment, </p><p>the banknote squeeze gets top attention.  As for </p><p>management of other crises, the GOZ seems confident of </p><p>free electricity from South Africa and free food from the </p><p>West.  In spite of GOZ\'s best efforts, market forces are </p><p>resolving the fuel crisis, although conventional gas </p><p>stations like Mobil, Caltex and BP are being squeezed out </p><p>of the market. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Otherwise, there is little to cheer: </p><p> </p><p>- With no chance of formal employment, perhaps half the </p><p>population has resigned itself to minimal subsistence </p><p>dependent on food donations.  (Low-skilled jobs are </p><p>available in cities, but salaries often do not cover </p><p>transport and lunch.) </p><p> </p><p>- President Mugabe has asked ZANU-PF stalwart Charles </p><p>Utete to oversee a land reform review, but we cannot </p><p>easily envisage the GOZ publicizing and acting upon a </p><p>report that spells out abuses by many cabinet ministers. </p><p>With each passing month, it becomes less likely that a </p><p>substantial number of the 4,000 dispossessed farmers will </p><p>return to farms. </p><p> </p><p>- Sources close to the GOZ report that businessman Gideon </p><p>Gono is front-runner for Reserve Bank President.  As </p><p>major shareholder in a private bank and owner of the </p><p>business newsweekly, he is a walking conflict-of- </p><p>interest.  We would expect him to be neither independent </p><p>nor outspoken. </p><p> </p><p>Only through political change, it seems, does Zimbabwe </p><p>stand any chance of stemming its broad economic decline. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
