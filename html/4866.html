Some of the </p><p>details leaked to the press are correct, some are wrong, </p><p>Yakis said.  Prime Minister Gul said that Turkey would wait </p><p>to see the report by UN arms inspectors.  Ankara\'s decision </p><p>will be shaped at the Supreme Military Council (YAS) meeting </p><p>today, and the National Security Council (MGK) meeting </p><p>tomorrow, papers agree. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Milliyet" claims the U.S. has asked for Turkey\'s support on </p><p>logistics, communication, and intelligence.  The U.S. has </p><p>also asked that Turkish troops speaking Kurdish and Arabic </p><p>should guide them in Northern Iraq.  The U.S. is planning to </p><p>use Turkish railroads to transport personnel and armored </p><p>vehicles, according to Milliyet.  "Vatan" reported that the </p><p>U.S. is pressuring Ankara to allow deployment of 80,000 U.S. </p><p>troops in the southeastern towns Sirnak and Silopi, whereas </p><p>Ankara is inclined to permit only small special teams. </p><p>Vatan also notes that Ankara has agreed to allow the U.S. </p><p>access to three Turkish ports in the Mediterranean. </p><p>According to "Yeni Safak," the U.S. wants to establish </p><p>military rule in Northern Iraq, where it is planning to stay </p><p>for at least five years to ensure political stability in the </p><p>region.  "Cumhuriyet" reports on its front page that the </p><p>U.S. has offered Turkey a "war bribe" of $5 billion in the </p><p>short-term, and $15-20 billion in the long term in exchange </p><p>for cooperation.  In an effort to keep the Kurds and British </p><p>troops away from Mosul and Kirkuk, Turkey wants to establish </p><p>"red lines" around the two Northern Iraqi towns, "Hurriyet" </p><p>claims.  Safeen Dizayee, the KDP representative in Ankara, </p><p>criticized Turkey in "Zaman" on Wednesday by saying that </p><p>Ankara exaggerated the situation in Northern Iraq.  Dizayee </p><p>warned that regional countries would not remain indifferent </p><p>to a unilateral Turkish intervention, which could draw Iran </p><p>into the conflict.  He noted that KDP leader Barzani would </p><p>visit Turkey next week.  A "Radikal" commentary claimed that </p><p>Ankara will give passive support to the U.S. by opening its </p><p>airbases, airspace, and territory.  The town of Silopi is </p><p>expected to become the operational headquarters and the </p><p>point for processing refugees.  Turkey is considering </p><p>setting up a buffer zone 30-40 km. deep in Northern Iraq; </p><p>this zone would ease the passage of U.S. and allied troops </p><p>and facilitate Turkish control over the region.  Ankara\'s </p><p>official position will be finalized at the NSC meeting on </p><p>Friday, and the government will seek parliamentary approval </p><p>for the deployment of foreign troops, the paper reported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Constitutional amendments: While the parliament is searching </p><p>for ways to override the  president\'s veto and enact </p><p>constitutional changes, the High Election Board (YSK) has </p><p>announced the calendar for the Siirt elections.  Elections </p><p>are set for February 9, and the  deadline for candidate </p><p>applications is January 23.  President Sezer will have to </p><p>sign the constitutional amendments by that time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The 80 thousand US soldiers" </p><p>Chief Columist of mass appeal Hurriyet, Oktay Eksi opined </p><p>(12/26): "It would be very foolish to believe that the US </p><p>intention is to bring democracy to Iraq and to the region. </p><p>When Kuwait was saved from the Iraq occupation in 1991, the </p><p>US did not care about democracy at all.  This is simply </p><p>because the operation was meant to prevent Iraq\'s control of </p><p>Kuwaiti oil reserves. . This is the very time to be </p><p>realistic and act accordingly.  Turkey, under the current </p><p>circumstances, has no chance to refuse to support the US. </p><p>Yet we better design Turkey\'s support to be as limited as </p><p>possible.  For instance, plans to station US soldiers in </p><p>Turkey and have them stay here for 5 years are totally </p><p>unacceptable." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Saddam should go" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief of mass appeal Milliyet, Mehmet Yakup Yilmaz </p><p>wrote (12/26): "Turkey\'s interest is in lasting stability </p><p>and a peaceful atmosphere in the region.  Yet this goal </p><p>cannot be achieved as long as Saddam remains in charge.  . </p><p>Opposing a war is certainly correct from the humanitarian </p><p>point of view, but when the situation makes war inevitable </p><p>there is no room for emotionalism.  Romantic stances do not </p><p>work, particularly in international relations.  . Let\'s hope </p><p>that Saddam realizes the fact that war is imminent and will </p><p>cost a colossal number of Iraqi lives." </p><p>"The Permanent Trouble" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(12/26): "A close look at Afghanistan will give us a clue </p><p>about US intentions in Iraq.  The US plans to remain in the </p><p>region permanently.  The Afghan operation helped the US to </p><p>expand its military presence from Pakistan to the </p><p>Philippines and Georgia.  In the event of an Iraq operation, </p><p>Turkey will be assuming Pakistan\'s role.  The roles of the </p><p>Philippines and Georgia will be given to Qatar, Saudi </p><p>Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. . All organs of the Turkish </p><p>state mechanism, particularly the parliament, should pay </p><p>utmost attention to US intentions for this region.  Turkey </p><p>should not be put in the position of introducing a </p><p>`permanent\' problem into the region." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
