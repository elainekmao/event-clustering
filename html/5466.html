<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 000745 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: THOUSANDS OF JORDANIANS ATTEND PEACEFUL ANTI-WAR </p><p>DEMONSTRATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  On February 1, several thousand demonstrators </p><p>participated in a short anti-war march through the Shmeisani </p><p>district of Amman.  The demonstration, organized by the </p><p>Opposition Parties Higher Coordination Committee, was </p><p>approved by the government and proceeded amidst a large and </p><p>visible police presence.  Press estimates of crowd size range </p><p>from 3,000 to 10,000 (with embassy contacts reporting 3,000 </p><p>to be the more accurate estimate).  The demonstration was the </p><p>largest since May 2002.  There were no reports of arrests or </p><p>violence. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The demonstrators hoisted pictures of King </p><p>Abdullah, Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein, chanted anti-war </p><p>slogans and listened to anti-Israeli and anti-US speeches. </p><p>Various media reports showed placards of Saddam Hussein </p><p>hoisting an AK-47 or puffing on a large cigar, alongside </p><p>signs which read "no to attacking Iraq."  Islamic Action </p><p>Front Secretary General Hamzeh Mansour addressed the crowd, </p><p>engaging in explicitly anti-American rhetoric: "Our message </p><p>to the American administration and the Zionist enemy is that </p><p>your war will not only be with Palestine and Iraq, but the </p><p>entire (Arab) nation." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT.  The march and rally were fully </p><p>choreographed in advance between the GOJ and the rally </p><p>sponsors.  While the rhetoric was sometimes heated (including </p><p>calls for Iraq to strike Tel Aviv), the protest remained </p><p>orderly and peaceful, and provided an opportunity for </p><p>opponents of war to vent some steam.  While permitting some </p><p>expressions of public dissatisfaction, the GOJ will likely </p><p>continue to restrict permits for protests and carefully </p><p>regulate those it does allow to go forward. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
