<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/IL, EB, WHA/PPC, WHA/EPSC, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB </p><p>USDA FOR FAS </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR AGATT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EAGR, EINV, ETRD, PHUM, PGOV, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: LABOR/MANAGEMENT RELATIONS EXCELLENT AT STANDARD </p><p>FRUIT (DOLE) IN HONDURAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 TEGUCIGALPA 3276 </p><p>     B. 02 TEGUCIGALPA 1861 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Standard Fruit (Dole) and its union </p><p>maintain good relations, with both sides saying that the two </p><p>have worked closely together since Hurricane Mitch in 1998. </p><p>In fact, Dole has announced an expansion of its investment in </p><p>Honduras.  While the union has declined in numbers and </p><p>strength, it remains a key player in Honduran labor, and is </p><p>the base of the important FESITRANH federation which in turn </p><p>controls the CTH confederation.  It is ironic that Standard </p><p>Fruit, long criticized for its actions in this former "banana </p><p>republic," now is an excellent example of harmonious </p><p>labor/management relations and the benefits foreign </p><p>investment can bring to Honduras when both sides bring a </p><p>constructive attitude to the table.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Dole Management: No Problems with Labor Unions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador, Econ Counselor, AID Director, and LabAtt </p><p>met with Gerald Brunelle, General Manager, and other top </p><p>officials Dole\'s Honduran subsidiary Standard Fruit of </p><p>Honduras and toured Dole\'s pineapple plantations, processing </p><p>plants, and laboratories in La Ceiba May 15.  Dole officials </p><p>said the Maya Division, which includes both Honduras and </p><p>Guatemala, employed 5,500 workers who belonged to five </p><p>different unions (the main union being SUTRASFCO).  Dole had </p><p>approximately 769 salaried personnel and also contracted with </p><p>independent producers.  Dole\'s Maya Division produces 10 </p><p>million boxes of bananas per year and independent banana </p><p>producers 4-5 million boxes per year for Dole.  Dole also </p><p>produces four million boxes of pineapples per year. </p><p>Pineapple workers were mainly contract labor (in the past </p><p>they had been unionized).  Dole recently announced an </p><p>important expansion of investment in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Dole officials said the company had excellent </p><p>relations with its unions, especially SUTRASFCO, and noted </p><p>that Hurricane Mitch had brought management and labor closer </p><p>and had led to improved productivity at the company. </p><p>Unionized workers receive some of the best pay and benefits </p><p>for workers in Honduras (housing, medical care, etc.); </p><p>non-unionized pineapple workers made considerably less (some </p><p>only approximately USD 1/day). </p><p> </p><p>Labor Union Praises Dole and Calls for More Investment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) LabAtt met May 15 with the main Standard Fruit Company </p><p>Workers\' Union (SUTRASFCO), led by President Carlos Lopez. </p><p>SUTRASFCO is a key union in the Federation of Workers\' Unions </p><p>of Honduras (FESITRANH), the base of power for Confederation </p><p>of Workers of Honduras (CTH) Secretary General Dinora </p><p>Aceituno.  (Note:  The CTH is one of three Honduran labor </p><p>confederations and is affiliated with the International </p><p>Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).  End Note.) </p><p>SUTRASFCO leadership confirmed that the union had had good </p><p>relations with Dole ever since Hurricane Mitch in 1998, with </p><p>the two sides working together to improve the company and </p><p>labor/management relations.  The union, which has an upcoming </p><p>election, is currently negotiating a new three-year </p><p>collective bargaining agreement.  The contract will cover </p><p>1,300 permanent workers, and for the first time will cover </p><p>some temporary workers.  Like Chiquita\'s union (ref A), </p><p>Dole\'s union leaders bemoaned the slow but steady decline in </p><p>jobs at Dole, which in turn led to the relative decline of </p><p>the union.  From 18,000 members in 1954 to 5,000 workers in </p><p>1975 (when the railroad and the port in La Ceiba were </p><p>nationalized), the union continued to decline, and lost 550 </p><p>jobs after the devastation of Hurricane Mitch. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) While there are of course minor problems, union </p><p>officials said they had no major problems with Dole.  The </p><p>major problem was a lack of any other job opportunities in </p><p>the La Ceiba area besides Dole.  With only a couple of </p><p>maquilas in the area, union officials gave an impassioned </p><p>pitch for increased private investment. </p><p> </p><p>Pesticide Court Case Continues to Block Settlement </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Over the past two presidential administrations, the </p><p>GOH has been coordinating tripartite negotiations for an out </p><p>of court settlement of workers and ex-workers affected by </p><p>DibromoChoropropane, or Nemagon, a pesticide used on Dole </p><p>banana plantations in the 1960s and 1970s (ref B).  In a 1997 </p><p>judgment against Shell Oil Company, Dow Chemical, and </p><p>Occidental Chemical Corporation, a U.S. court charged Nemagon </p><p>producers USD 41.5 million for damages due to sterility of a </p><p>few hundred Honduran workers, and another 25,000 workers in </p><p>11 countries worldwide.  Most of the Honduran plaintiffs have </p><p>already received payments as a result of this settlement. </p><p>However, a larger number of Honduran workers suffering a </p><p>wider array of claimed side-effects have been clamoring for </p><p>some form of workers\' compensation from Dole.  A class action </p><p>suit against Dole remains in the U.S. courts and has impeded </p><p>any national resolution.  Despite efforts by a </p><p>government-sponsored commission of management, labor, and </p><p>government officials from the Ministries of Justice, Labor, </p><p>and Health, and a desire by Dole to settle the lawsuit, the </p><p>class action suit in U.S. courts has yet to be dropped by the </p><p>workers.  This has impeded Dole from proceeding with an out </p><p>of court settlement in Honduras.  SUTRASFCO officials said </p><p>they understood Dole\'s position and hoped that a settlement </p><p>could be reached. </p><p> </p><p>Standard Fruit a Positive Example </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment.  It is somewhat ironic that it Standard </p><p>Fruit, long criticized for its actions in this former "banana </p><p>republic," is now an excellent example of harmonious </p><p>labor/management relations and the benefits foreign </p><p>investment can bring to Honduras when both sides bring a </p><p>constructive attitude to the table.  Not unique in their </p><p>devastation from Hurricane Mitch, Dole and Chiquita both have </p><p>invested to rebuild their Honduran operations in contrast to </p><p>several Honduran banana companies that did not.  If workers </p><p>drop their U.S. lawsuit, an out of court settlement of the </p><p>pesticide case would then solve the only outstanding labor </p><p>issue.  End Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
