RANGOON 846 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 30 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary: In the absence of a reliable method for </p><p>remitting foreign exchange, the "hundi" system flourishes in </p><p>Burma.  The system is used by nearly everyone in the country </p><p>who needs to get dollars in or out, from NGOs to military </p><p>officers.  Though hundi in Burma is undoubtedly used to </p><p>facilitate drug trafficking, we\'ve no evidence to date that </p><p>it\'s being used to finance terrorism or anti-American groups </p><p>in Burma.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Never Did Trust Those Banks </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Though hundi is best known in Burma as a way to send </p><p>and receive foreign exchange without dealing with burdensome </p><p>and extortionate regulations, the system is also fairly well </p><p>established as a way for buyers and sellers to move kyat </p><p>around the country.  This latter system has been </p><p>reinvigorated since the decline of the private banking system </p><p>this year. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The international hundi system in Burma has been alive </p><p>and well since the Socialist era (1962-88) when no private </p><p>banking existed, and locals were not allowed to hold any </p><p>foreign currency.  Burmese working abroad (especially </p><p>merchant seamen) availed themselves regularly of hundi as </p><p>they were legally obliged to remit their dollars to family </p><p>members\' accounts at government banks.  Account holders could </p><p>withdraw the money, but only in kyat at the overvalued </p><p>official 6 kyat/dollar rate. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The SPDC (nee SLORC) takeover in 1988, ostensibly </p><p>ushered in a new era of "market reforms," where private </p><p>companies, organizations, and individuals who earned foreign </p><p>exchange were allowed to open foreign exchange accounts at </p><p>the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank and the Myanmar Investment and </p><p>Commercial Bank.  However, in a typically counterintuitive </p><p>policy, Burmese nationals were still prohibited from holding </p><p>foreign exchange.  When the Foreign Exchange Certificate </p><p>(FEC) was introduced in 1993, Burmese nationals were allowed </p><p>to withdraw their foreign exchange in that form.  However, at </p><p>market rates the FEC is worth about 10-40 percent less than </p><p>the still proscribed greenback.  Furthermore, the government </p><p>takes an automatic 10 percent tax off the top of any foreign </p><p>exchange deposits. </p><p> </p><p>How Does it Work? </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Dealers in transnational hundi operate in a similar </p><p>fashion to their American counterparts.  A Burmese expatriate </p><p>or foreign business person in Rangoon will approach a dealer </p><p>to have their dollars transferred to the dealer\'s counterpart </p><p>at the other end of the network.  The dealers will arrange </p><p>with their counterpart some verification method to ensure the </p><p>right person gets the transferred funds.  Money arriving in </p><p>Burma via hundi is paid out in kyat, at a market-based </p><p>exchange rate.  The settlement of the dealers\' accounts of </p><p>either end of the transaction can occur in many ways, </p><p>depending on whether the relationship of the dealers is </p><p>familial or business. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Hundi dealers operating in Burma are widespread and </p><p>can be part of a large, global, family network or merely a </p><p>one-man operation.  Local brokers tend to work as money </p><p>changers, gold or gem merchants, traders, or travel agents. </p><p>Hundi is also run on occasion by individuals out of their </p><p>homes.  The hundi network in Burma is found primarily in the </p><p>Chinatown section of Rangoon, along the Thai and Chinese </p><p>borders, and in the country\'s commercial hub Mandalay.  The </p><p>system is clearly illegal, violating the government\'s very </p><p>strict foreign exchange control regulations. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Hundi operators in Burma rely on both direct and </p><p>hub-and-spoke transfers of cash, depending on how large their </p><p>particular network is.  One of the larger family-based </p><p>networks has affiliates in Rangoon, Mandalay, Chiang Mai, </p><p>Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Kunming, and San Francisco. </p><p>Smaller brokers, or those without ties, will use Bangkok or </p><p>Singapore as hubs to get money forwarded all over the world. </p><p>Though Burmese migrant workers in the Middle East also use </p><p>the hundi system, we\'ve heard no allegations of major hundi </p><p>operators in Rangoon with direct ties to those countries. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Hundi dealers earn fees in three primary ways, and </p><p>often in combination.  First, they might take a percentage of </p><p>the transaction -- usually around 5 to 6 percent.  A second </p><p>option is for the dealer to offer a skewed exchange rate and </p><p>rake in the difference.  Finally, the user and dealer might </p><p>cut some side business deal. </p><p>9. (SBU) Businessmen complain that the Burmese transnational </p><p>hundi system is expensive, and not always run by honest </p><p>brokers.  However, they admit that businesses and individuals </p><p>have little choice when they need to get cash overseas. </p><p>Since there is no legal recourse if a dealer doesn\'t hold up </p><p>his end of the bargain, hundi dealers are known to abscond </p><p>from time to time with the money with which they have been </p><p>entrusted.  Rumors that a hundi dealer along the Chinese </p><p>border had disappeared with millions of dollars worth of Asia </p><p>Wealth Bank\'s (AWB) wealth helped spark the initial run on </p><p>that bank, and the subsequent general banking crisis, in </p><p>February 2003. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Dishonesty in the Burmese hundi system is fueled by </p><p>a number of country-specific ingredients.  First is the </p><p>users\' lack of legal alternatives to transfer funds overseas. </p><p> Second, someone intent on stealing a "shipment" of foreign </p><p>exchange in cash poor Burma, would need only one large score </p><p>to ensure a comfortable underground retirement.  Finally, </p><p>Burma\'s convoluted economic system encourages patronage, </p><p>corruption, "working the system," and making a quick buck. </p><p>Thus, making a killing in the underground hundi market makes </p><p>as much sense to a budding "entrepreneur" as trading in cell </p><p>phones or presenting fraudulent import invoices. </p><p> </p><p>Who\'s Using Hundi? </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Over the past decade, the expansion of Burma\'s </p><p>international trade, the slow but steady intrickle of </p><p>international NGOs and small investors, and the continuing </p><p>disincentives to use the formal system have allowed hundi to </p><p>flourish.  It is impossible to know exactly how much flows in </p><p>and out through this illegal, and thus very private, system. </p><p>However, we\'ve heard estimates from knowledgeable sources </p><p>that from $600-800 million per year comes into the country, </p><p>and at least $600 million streams out.  This is notable in </p><p>contrast to the IMF\'s CY 2002 estimates of $470 million in </p><p>foreign exchange reserves, and $1 billion in total money </p><p>supply. </p><p> </p><p>-- Burmese seamen and expatriates use hundi to remit dollars </p><p>to their economically ravaged families.  It\'s estimated that </p><p>50,000 Burmese are working overseas now (15,000 are seamen). </p><p> </p><p>-- Exporters, faced with a 10 percent tax on export earnings, </p><p>often underinvoice and instruct their overseas buyers to </p><p>deposit the difference informally into offshore bank accounts </p><p>(usually in Singapore).  These traders then use the hundi </p><p>system to repatriate this money from their offshore accounts </p><p>when they need to convert their dollars to kyat. </p><p> </p><p>-- Importers, who must have offsetting export income for all </p><p>imports, also often underinvoice to maximize the amount they </p><p>can bring in or to avoid customs duties and other taxes.  The </p><p>importers then settle the difference with their overseas </p><p>sellers informally using hundi.  It\'s been alleged that the </p><p>government turns a blind eye to this use of hundi for large </p><p>corporations involved in priority construction projects. </p><p> </p><p>-- Foreign investors and international NGOs use hundi to get </p><p>money into the country, evading the 10 percent tax on foreign </p><p>exchange deposited the government banks.  By avoiding the </p><p>banks, investors and NGOs also evade the requirement of </p><p>withdrawing their foreign exchange deposits in FEC.  Though </p><p>it would be possible for local Muslim charities to use the </p><p>hundi system to bring funds into the country, we have no </p><p>evidence that they are doing so. </p><p>-- Wealthy individuals in Burma use hundi to illegally </p><p>expatriate their hidden dollar assets and/or send money to </p><p>children living and studying overseas.  The student visa </p><p>function here is complicated as even the wealthiest </p><p>prospective student\'s ability to pay for schooling often </p><p>defies documentation requirements. </p><p> </p><p>Guns, Drugs, and Terror? </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Because the hundi system in Burma is widespread with </p><p>many small-scale operators, it can be easily used for </p><p>nefarious purposes.  Though authorities keep an eye on the </p><p>larger hundi dealers, it is very difficult for them to </p><p>consistently crack down on all dealers.  There is also the </p><p>question of conflict of interest.  Military Intelligence (MI) </p><p>is charged with keeping an eye on the hundi and black market </p><p>currency exchange dealers (usually the same people) to </p><p>enforce currency laws, adjust the dollar/kyat exchange rate, </p><p>and monitor significant inflows of foreign exchange destined </p><p>for anyone affiliated with known insurgents or other </p><p>"destructionists."  However, these same MI officials are </p><p>often making money from this same hundi system, either as </p><p>operators or by taking bribes from operators.  Furthermore, </p><p>MI, and other government officials to the highest levels, </p><p>rely on these hundi/currency exchange dealers, just like </p><p>everyone else, for their services. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) We have evidence that the hundi system in Burma is </p><p>used to facilitate the narcotics trade.  For example, drug </p><p>traffickers in Thailand or Hong Kong will send funds via </p><p>hundi into Burma to pay the local suppliers or producers. </p><p>However, dealers involved in this type of hundi are more </p><p>often than not guilty only of a sin of ignorance.  Dealers </p><p>rarely explore the source of the funds flowing through their </p><p>shops or the backgrounds of their customers. </p><p> </p><p>14. (S) We\'ve no evidence that the hundi system here is being </p><p>used for external financing of any terrorist network.  While </p><p>the potential is there should such a network emerge in Burma, </p><p>we think the chances are relatively slim.  Though MI\'s </p><p>involvement in the hundi system creates a certain amount of </p><p>moral hazard, and the risk is always present of an individual </p><p>MI officer taking a bribe to turn the other way on a </p><p>dangerous transaction, we believe MI\'s shadowy presence in </p><p>hundi, and Burmese people\'s instinctive fear of MI scrutiny, </p><p>would dissuade most provocateurs from trying to funnel in </p><p>large sums using hundi.  Funding for any potential terrorist </p><p>activity is much more likely to come in via courier; also an </p><p>easy proposition considering the porous borders, often </p><p>outside government control, and notoriously venal customs and </p><p>regional military officers. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
