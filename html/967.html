<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 003592 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA: 1998 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 202128, (B) COLOMBO 2736 </p><p> </p><p>1.   THE FOLLOWING IS POST\'S RESPONSE TO REF A </p><p>REQUESTING INPUT FOR THE DEPARTMENT\'S 1998 ANNUAL </p><p>TERRORISM REPORT.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA (GSL) </p><p>CONTINUED TO BATTLE THE SEPARATIST LIBERATION TIGERS </p><p>OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE), THE ONLY TERRORIST GROUP </p><p>CURRENTLY BELIEVED TO BE ACTIVE IN SRI LANKA.  ON </p><p>OCTOBER 8, 1997, THE DEPARTMENT DESIGNATED THE LTTE AS </p><p>A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION UNDER PROVISIONS OF </p><p>THE ANTI-TERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF </p><p>1996.  THROUGHOUT 1998 THE GSL CONTINUED INTENSIFIED </p><p>MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST THE LTTE.  BETWEEN MAY </p><p>1997 (WHEN THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED A MAJOR OFFENSIVE </p><p>TO OPEN A LAND-ROUTE TO JAFFNA) AND THE END OF 1998, </p><p>OVER 5000 COMBATANTS ON BOTH SIDE COMBINED WERE KILLED </p><p>IN THE FIGHTING.  LTTE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES CONTINUED </p><p>DURING THE YEAR, WITH, FOR EXAMPLE, A SHIP HIJACKING, </p><p>A TRUCK BOMBING AT THE PRINCIPAL BUDDHIST TEMPLE IN </p><p>SRI LANKA, ANO A VEHICLE BOMBING IN COLOMBO WHICH LEFT </p><p>28 CIVILIANS DEAD.  THERE IS ALSO COMPELLING EVIOENCE </p><p>THE LTTE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SHOOTING DOWN A CIVILIAN </p><p>AIRCRAFT ON SEPTEMBER 29, KILLING ALL 55 PASSENGERS </p><p>AND CREW ONBOARD.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THE LTTE WAS </p><p>USING THE INTERNET TO ATTACK GSL EMBASSIES OR OTHER </p><p>TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS A </p><p>THROUGH K IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (A)  THERE WERE NO GSL PROSECUTIONS OF PEOPLE </p><p>INVOLVEO IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SIGNIFICANT </p><p>ACTS OF OOMESTIC TERRORISM.  MANY SUSPECTEO MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE LTTE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND DETAINED UNDER THE </p><p>EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM </p><p>ACT AND SOME HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH RELATIVELY MINOR </p><p>OFFENSES SUCH AS WITHHOLDING INFORMATION.  NO </p><p>IMPORTANT LTTE LEADER HAS EVER BEEN APPREHENDED AND </p><p>PROSECUTED.  LTTE HEAD VELUPILLAI PRABHAKARAN AND NINE </p><p>OTHER LTTE MEMBERS REMAIN INDICTED FOR COMPLICITY IN </p><p>THE JANUARY 31, 1996 CENTRAL BANK BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>(B)  THE GSL DID NOT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION </p><p>DURING THE YEAR.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DID NOT REQUEST </p><p>ANY EXTRADITIONS OR ASK FOR ASSTSTANCE IN TERRORIST </p><p>CASES.  IN JUNE 1995, THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA </p><p>REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF LTTE HEAD PRABHAKARAN AND </p><p>TWO OTHER SENIOR LTTE MEMBERS (INTELLIGENCE CHIEF </p><p>POTTU AMMAN AND WOMEN\'S WING LEADER AKILA, THE LATTER </p><p>OF WHOM IS NOW BELIEVED DEAD) FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF </p><p>RAJIV GANDHI.  EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS HAVE NOT BEGUN, </p><p>AND IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THESE LTTE LEADERS WILL BE </p><p>APPREHENDED IN ANY EVENT. </p><p> </p><p>(C)  POST IS AWARE OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO </p><p>GSL PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS.  THE GSL, HOWEVER, WOULD LIKE TO NEGOTIATE </p><p>A NEW EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE USG SINCE THE </p><p>CURRENT TREATY PRE-DATES SRI LANKA\'S INDEPENDENCE AND </p><p>HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO INCREASING LEGAL CHALLENGES DURING </p><p>COURT CASES IN SRI LANKA.  IN SRI LANKA, TERRORISM IS </p><p>ILLEGAL UNDER THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT.  SRI </p><p>LANKAN EXTRADITION LAW PERMITS EXTRADITION OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS TO OTHER COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES. </p><p>MOREOVER, SRI LANKA IS A SIGNATORY TO THE 1988 SOUTH </p><p>ASIAN ASSOCIATION FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION (SAARC) </p><p>REGIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORISM, </p><p>WHICH DESIGNATES CERTAIN ACTS SPECIFICALLY AS </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS AND NOT AS POLITICAL ACTS, THEREBY </p><p>NULLIFYING ATTEMPTS BY TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS TO </p><p>CLAIM POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS FOR VIOLENCE.  THE GSL </p><p>THEREFORE SEEMS OBLIGED TO COOPERATE WITH THE REQUESTS </p><p>FROM INDIA FOR THE EXTRADITION OF PRABHAKARAN AND </p><p>POTTU AMMAN, THOUGH IT IS LIKELY THAT ITS OWN </p><p>PROSECUTION WOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE -- ESPECIALLY NOW </p><p>THAT PRABHAKARAN HAS ACTUALLY BEEN INDICTED FOR A </p><p>TERRORIST ACT. </p><p> </p><p>(0)  ITSELF A TARGET OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, THE </p><p>GSL HAS BEEN STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF TERRORISM.  THE GSL </p><p>COOPERATED FULLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IN THEIR </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF THE RAJIV GANDHI ASSASSINATION.  SRI </p><p>LANKA HAS BEEN QUICK TO CONOEMN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, AND IS A </p><p>SIGNATORY TO THE TOKYO, THE HAGUE AND MONTREAL </p><p>CONVENTIONS AGAINST TERRORISM, AND HAS PASSED THE </p><p>NECESSARY ENABLING LEGISLATION FOR ALL THREE </p><p>PROTOCOLS. </p><p> </p><p>(E)  THE GSL IS CONDUCTING ONGOING COUNTER-TERRORIST </p><p>ANO COUNTER-INSURGENCY OPERATIONS AGAINST THE LTTE, </p><p>INCLUOING MILITARY ACTIONS AND SPECIAL MEASURES TO </p><p>PROTECT URBAN AREAS, IMPORTANT INSTALLATIONS ANO </p><p>GOVERNMENT LEADERS.  THESE ARE AIMED AT WEAKENING THE </p><p>LTTE AND INHIBITING ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS AS WELL AS MILITARY OPERATIONS.  THE GSL </p><p>ADDRESSED TERRORISM ISSUES THIS YEAR IN SEVERAL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA INCLUDING THE UNGA IN NEW YORK AND </p><p>THE UNHRC IN GENEVA. </p><p> </p><p>(F)  THE GSL DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>(G)  THE GSL HAS MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM </p><p>ISSUE.  HOWEVER, IT HAS NOT ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION OF THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES </p><p>OF LIBYA, IRAQ, IRAN AND SUDAN.  THE GSL\'S SUPPORT OF </p><p>U.S. STRIKES AGAINST TERRORIST TARGETS IN SUDAN AND </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WAS ONLY LUKEWARM, WITH THE GSL STATING </p><p>THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>SHOULD BE CONDUCTEO "NOT BY UNILATERAL ACTION BUT IN </p><p>FULL CONFORMITY WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE PRINCIPLES </p><p>OF THE UN CHARTER AND RESPECT FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY AND </p><p>TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ALL STATES" (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>(H)  THE GSL VIEWS THE OCTOBER 8, 1997 USG DESIGNATION </p><p>OF THE LTTE AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AS A </p><p>MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN ITS ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS.  THE </p><p>USG DESIGNATION HAS ENCOURAGED THE GSL TO MAINTAIN ITS </p><p>APPROACH TO COMBATING TERRORISM BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY. </p><p> </p><p>(I)  THE GSL HAS ACCEPTED THE U.S. OFFER OF INCREASED </p><p>ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM </p><p>(ATA).  IN 1998, SRI LANKAN SECURITY FORCES PERSONNEL </p><p>TOOK PART IN SEPARATE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN EXPLOSIVE </p><p>INCIDENT COUNTERMEASURES, VITAL INSTALLATION SECURITY, </p><p>AND POST-BLAST INVESTIGATION.  THE GSL HELPED DRAFT </p><p>AND WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY TO SIGN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PROTOCOL AGAINST BOMBING AT THE UN IN JANUARY (THE USG </p><p>SIGNED SECOND).  IN 1997, SRI LANKA RATIFIED THE 1988 </p><p>PROTOCOL FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF UNLAWFUL ACTS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AT AIRPORTS SERVING INTERNATIONAL CIVIL </p><p>AVIATION.  IN ADDITION, IT IS EITHER A SIGNATORY, OR </p><p>HAS TAKEN THE NECESSARY INTERNAL STEPS TO BECOME A </p><p>SIGNATORY, TO THE 1979 CONVENTION AGAINST THE TAKING </p><p>OF HOSTAGES, AND THE 1979 CONVENTION ON THE PHYSICAL </p><p>PROTECTION OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS.  THOUGH THE GSL HAS </p><p>YET TO RATIFY THE 1991 CONVENTION OF THE MARKING OF </p><p>PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES FOR THE PURPOSES OF OETECTION, ANO </p><p>THE 1988 CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF UNLAWFUL </p><p>ACTS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF MARITIME NAVIGATION, THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS INDICATED THAT THE GSL </p><p>IS RECEPTIVE TO BECOMING A SIGNATORY. </p><p> </p><p>(J-1)  THE GSL HAS COOPERATED FULLY WITH U.S. </p><p>OFFICIALS INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF U.S. </p><p>LAW BY INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>(J2)  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CONFIRMED CASES OF TERRORIST </p><p>ACTS DIRECTED AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS IN SRI LANKA. </p><p> </p><p>(K)    THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SEVERAL REQUESTS </p><p>TO THE GSL FOR ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES FOR U.S- </p><p>PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES IN SRI LANKA.  ALL REQUESTS </p><p>HAVE BEEN MET EXPEOITIOUSLY BY THE GSL.  THESE </p><p>REQUESTS WERE MADE TO ENHANCE SECURITY IN GENERAL AND </p><p>NOT IN RESPONSE TO ANY IDENTIFIABLE THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>DONNELLY </p><p></p></div>
