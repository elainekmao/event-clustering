<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TOKYO 00364 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR OES/OFA/OPA, EAP/J </p><p>USDOC FOR NOAA ADMINISTRATOR CALIO AND FOR </p><p>NOAA/NMFS TO PASS TO F/M321 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  EFIS, JA, IWC-2 </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOJ WHALING </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 5140 </p><p>- </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  POST DELIVERS WHALE TALKING POINTS </p><p>IN REFTEL TO GOJ OFFICIALS IN MOFA.  MOFA OFFICIALS </p><p>QUESTION USG CALCULATION OF GOJ QUOTA UNDER "PAST </p><p>PRACTICES" FORMULA.  GOJ HAS NOT MADE DECISION </p><p>REGARDING ACTUAL NUMBER OF WHALES TO BE HARVESTED </p><p>BY ANTARCTIC FLEET THIS SEASON, BUT GOJ AND USSR </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE EXCHANGED "EXPRESSIONS OF INTENTION" </p><p>NOT TO EXCEED LAST YEAR\'S HARVESTS.  TOTAL COASTAL </p><p>SPERM WHALE CATCH AS OF JANUARY 7 IS 106 WHALES. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  (C) ON JANUARY 8, REGFISHATT MET WITH SUSUMU </p><p>AKIYAMA AND KENRO IINO, DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>RESPECTIVELY OF THE FISHERY DIVISION OF THE ECONOMIC </p><p>AFFAIRS BUREAU OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MOFA), </p><p>AND DELIVERED A COPY OF THE FIVE TALKING POINTS </p><p>GIVEN IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL.  BOTH INDICATED THE </p><p>TALKING POINTS WOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER WITHIN </p><p>MOFA AND WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FISHERY AGENCY OF </p><p>JAPAN (FAJ).  IINO NOTED IMMEDIATELY THAT FAJ </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>CONSULTATIONS REGARDING THE WHALING ISSUE WITH USG </p><p>OFFICIALS.  AKIYAMA STATED THAT "NO DECISION HAS </p><p>BEEN MADE" IN GOJ REGARDING THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF </p><p>WHALES TO BE HARVESTED IN THE ANTARCTIC BY THE </p><p>JAPANESE FLEET THIS SEASON.  HE MENTIONED THREE </p><p>FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DECIDING AN "APPROPRIATE" </p><p>HARVEST AS FOLLOWS: </p><p>- </p><p>(A) THE MOST RECENT HARVEST LEVELS SET BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION (IWC) THAT HAD </p><p>BEEN ACCEPTED BY GOJ (I.E., THE 1984 SEASON OVERALL </p><p>QUOTA OF 3,027); </p><p>- </p><p>(B) CONSULTATIONS WITH CONCERNED COUNTRIES; AND </p><p>- </p><p>(C) THE FINDINGS OF THE IWC SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE </p><p>AT THE 1984 IWC MEETING. </p><p>- </p><p>HE FURTHER MENTIONED HIS "PERSONAL VIEW" THAT THE </p><p>MOST IMPORTANT OF THE CONSULTATIONS WOULD BE THOSE </p><p>WITH THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT GOJ WOULD OFFICIALLY </p><p>RESPOND LATER TO THE U.S. BELIEF THAT "THERE IS NO </p><p>NEED FOR CONSULTATIONS."  AKIYAMA ALSO POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT JAPAN HAS NO INTENTION OF TAKING AN UNLIMITED </p><p>NUMBER OF WHALES EVEN THOUGH THE FILING OF AN </p><p>OBJECTION WITH THE IWC MEANS GOJ IS NOT BOUND TO </p><p>ANY SPECIFIC QUOTA. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  (C) AKIYAMA SAID THAT GOJ AND THE SOVIET UNION </p><p>HAVE EXCHANGED "EXPRESSIONS OF INTENTION" TO CONDUCT </p><p>THIS SEASON\'S WHALING FOR MINKE WHALES IN THE </p><p>ANTARCTIC IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE TOTAL CATCH WILL NOT </p><p>EXCEED LAST SEASON\'S HARVEST LEVELS OF 3,027 WHALES </p><p>FOR JAPAN AND 3,028 WHALES FOR THE SOVIET UNION. </p><p>AKIYAMA NOTED THAT THE EXCHANGE OF INTENTIONS WITH </p><p>THE SOVIET UNION CORRESPONDED TO THE ARRANGEMENT </p><p>REACHED BETWEEN THE USSR, GOJ, AND BRAZIL </p><p>REGARDING LAST SEASON\'S ANTARCTIC HARVEST, A </p><p>COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE IWC SECRETARIAT. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  (C) SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE POSED REGARDING </p><p>THE TALKING POINTS: </p><p>- </p><p>(A) IINO REFERRED TO THE LAST TALKING POINT, AND </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE ESTABLISHES A 1984/85 </p><p>HARVEST OF 342 WHALES FOR BRAZIL INSTEAD OF THE </p><p>376 USED BY THE USG.  AKIYAMA THOUGHT THAT THE 376 </p><p>FIGURE PROBABLY INCLUDES THE TEN PERCENT IWC </p><p>MARGIN OF ERROR THAT IS ALLOWED FOR WHALING IN </p><p>AREA II, BUT HE POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE </p><p>OF THE USSR/GOJ/BRAZIL AGREEMENTS HAS  BEEN NOT </p><p>TO PROVIDE FOR ANY MARGIN OF ERROR FOR THE </p><p>HARVEST IN AREA II.  THUS, IN THE 1983/84 SEASON </p><p>THE FIVE PERCENT MARGIN OF ERROR ALLOWED BY THE </p><p>IWC FOR AREA II WOULD HAVE ALLOWED A BRAZILIAN </p><p>HARVEST OF 630 MINKE WHALES, BUT THE GOJ/USSR/BRAZIL </p><p>ARRANGEMENT LIMITED BRAZIL\'S HARVEST TO 600 WHALES. </p><p>SIMILARLY, FOR THE 1984/85 SEASON, BRAZIL WILL </p><p>HARVEST 342 WHALES IN AREA II, NOT 342 PLUS TEN PERCENT, </p><p>OR 376 WHALES.  ACCORDINGLY, GOJ\'S QUOTA UNDER THE </p><p>IWC GUIDELINES SHOULD BE 1,941 MINKE WHALES, NOT </p><p>1,924. AKIYAMA AND IINO WANTED TO BE SURE THAT THE </p><p>USG REALIZED THAT A "PAST PRACTICE" CALUCATIONS </p><p>WOULD ALLOW GOJ A HARVEST QUOTA OF 1,941 FOR THIS </p><p>SEASON. </p><p> </p><p>(B) THE FISHERY DIVISION OFFICIALS ALSO ASKED FOR </p><p>USG CLARIFICATION OF THE REFERENCE IN THE SECOND </p><p>TALKING POINT TO THE NOVEMBER 13, 1984, LETTER OF THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF COMMERCE REGARDING THE PHRASE "IN </p><p>EXCESS OF THE 1984/85 QUOTA FOR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE </p><p>MINKE WHALES."  IN PARTICULAR, GOJ WANTS TO KNOW IF </p><p>GOJ IS SAFE FROM THE THREAT OF CERTIFICATION UNDER </p><p>THE PACKWOOD AMENDMENT TO THE MAGNUSON FISHERY </p><p>CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT (MFCMA) IF GOJ </p><p>HARVESTS FOR ANTARCTIC MINKE WHALES DO NOT EXCEED </p><p>A CEILING OF 1,924 (OR 1,941) WHALES.  FURTHER </p><p>ELABORATION ON THE SAME QUESTION WAS RAISED </p><p>WITH THE COMMENT THAT USSR AND GOJ WHALERS BOTH </p><p>OPERATE IN AREAS 4 AND 6 BUT ONLY GOJ OPERATIONS </p><p>OCCUR IN AREA 5.  AS A RESULT, AKIYAMA AND IINO </p><p>WONDERED IF THE TALKING POINTS WERE ONLY REFERRING TO </p><p>AN OVERALL ANTARCTIC QUOTA FOR GOJ OF </p><p>1,924 (OR 1,941) OR WHETHER THE QUOTA FOR EACH </p><p>AREA WOULD BE EXAMINED IN ANY USG EVALUATION OF </p><p>WHETHER MINKE CATCH LIMITS ARE BEING EXCEEDED THIS </p><p>SEASON. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  (U) REGARDING REFTEL\'S PARA 5, AKIYAMA </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT 106 SPERM WHALES, ALL MALES, </p><p>HAD BEEN HARVESTED BY THE JAPANESE COASTAL </p><p>WHALING FLEET THROUGH JANUARY 7. </p><p>- </p><p>CLARK </p><p></p></div>
