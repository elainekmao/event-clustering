<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 000885 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PM/DTC, WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 532/OEA </p><p>COMMERCE FOR BUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY: BNILSSON AND </p><p>DHOOKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KOMC, PREL, PHUM, PARM, ETTC, ETRD, BEXP, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS IN HONDURAS; PROBLEMS WITH </p><p>LA ARMERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 TEGUCIGALPA 3428 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 SECSTATE 113261 </p><p>     C. LYNN-CUMMINS EMAIL 03APR2003 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: La Armeria (The Armory), the only certified </p><p>firearms distributor in Honduras, continues to exhibit </p><p>difficulties in complying with State Department guidance </p><p>regarding the importation of commercial firearms.  In </p><p>December 2002 Post recommended that State deny La Armeria\'s </p><p>request to import pistols, revolvers, rifles, and the </p><p>corresponding ammunition.  This recommendation was supported </p><p>by a variety of factors, including the inordinately high rate </p><p>of violent crime in Honduras, the lack of any meaningful arms </p><p>control or regulation by the government, and because La </p><p>Armeria continues to do business without firm purchase </p><p>orders, sales contracts, or import licenses.  Recently, La </p><p>Armeria contacted Post expressing an interest in once again </p><p>importing firearms and ammunition for commercial use.  Post </p><p>reiterated the legal requirements with which La Armeria must </p><p>comply before any import license can be approved.  Post also </p><p>notes its concurrence with PM/DTC that all Honduran </p><p>applications must have a specific import certificate and that </p><p>verification of end use is an important aspect of defense </p><p>trade controls that continues to be problematic in Honduras. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>OAS Model Regulations </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Government of Honduras (GOH) is a signator of </p><p>the OAS Model Regulations for the Control of the </p><p>International Movement of Firearms, although it has yet to </p><p>ratify the agreement.  Nevertheless, the MFA has informed </p><p>Post that it considers the OAS regulations legally binding </p><p>and that the GOH will comply with its regulations.  The </p><p>agreement requires that the GOH establish an effective import </p><p>regime and that all firearms import requests be accompanied </p><p>by a GOH import certificate. To date, it appears that the GOH </p><p>has yet to establish such a regime.  Also, Post is not aware </p><p>that the GOH has ever issued an import certificate. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) PM/DTC has indicated that it will not consider </p><p>Honduran firearm and ammunition license applications which </p><p>are not accompanied by a GOH import certificate.  La Armeria </p><p>has been made aware of this requirement (ref C). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Purchase Orders and/or Sales Contracts </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Post understands that in order to obtain a license </p><p>from the Department of State, a U.S. firm or individual </p><p>seeking an export license must have a firm purchase order or </p><p>sales contract from the buyer (ref B).  Letters of intent, </p><p>invoices, unconfirmed statements of purchase projections, or </p><p>likely purchases are not sufficient to meet the requirements </p><p>for issuance of such a license.  It has been the standard </p><p>operating procedure of La Armeria not to enter into firm </p><p>contracts of sale or purchase orders, but rather to routinely </p><p>make projections of arms and munitions that they might or </p><p>might not purchase.  Past investigations at Post have </p><p>indicated that many times La Armeria obtains "quotes" or </p><p>"bids" from more than one arms manufacturer for exactly the </p><p>same product.  Thereafter, they might or might not purchase </p><p>the arms from one of more of the companies that gave them </p><p>quotes (ref A).  Post has informed La Armeria that future </p><p>applications must contain firm purchase orders and/or sales </p><p>contracts.  La Armeria acknowledges that past applications </p><p>have lacked firm purchase orders or sales contracts and has </p><p>indicated that all future orders will comply with this </p><p>requirement. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>La Armeria\'s Position </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Article 292 of the Honduran Constitution grants the </p><p>Honduran Armed Forces the exclusive right of "fabrication, </p><p>importation, distribution, and sale of firearms, ammunition, </p><p>and similar items."  The constitutional powers of the armed </p><p>forces in the specific cases of commercial and sporting </p><p>activities have been delegated to the Institute of Military </p><p>Provision through a dependency called La Armeria.  This makes </p><p>La Armeria the sole distributor of commercial and sporting </p><p>firearms in Honduras.  La Armeria (run by active-duty </p><p>military officers) has stated that its special relationship </p><p>granted under the Honduran constitution exempts the </p><p>organization from the requirement to have import certificates </p><p>issued by the GOH. Post notes that in the past, La Armeria </p><p>has been hampered by corruption. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>End Use and Security Considerations </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Post understands that verification of end use is an </p><p>important aspect of defense trade controls and that Post </p><p>plays a critical role in this effort.  Post carefully </p><p>analyzes all applications whereby sales are being proposed </p><p>for "uncontrolled" sales for public use.  Recent applications </p><p>for export licenses to Honduras have indicated that firearms </p><p>and ammunition were intended for commercial resale to retail </p><p>customers or governmental agencies.  Post understands that </p><p>the appropriate standard to apply in situations such as this </p><p>is whether or not the conditions in the country warrant the </p><p>described sale. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Honduras has no effective arms control or </p><p>regulation.  Honduran armed forces continue to be deployed to </p><p>augment police units throughout Honduras in an effort to </p><p>combat crime and provide a modicum of security.  Honduras has </p><p>one of the highest homicide rates in the Western Hemisphere </p><p>and gang violence continues to be a serious issue.  There is </p><p>also a high rate of extrajudicial killings, especially of </p><p>adolescents and young adults, mostly by firearms.  Finally, </p><p>President Maduro has publicly raised concerns about the </p><p>proliferation of weapons in Honduras and illicit arms </p><p>trafficking remains a problem.  La Armeria has been informed </p><p>that Post must take local considerations into account when </p><p>considering whether or not to recommend a particular export </p><p>license, regardless of whether the proper documentation has </p><p>been submitted to State for consideration. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) PolOff and A/DATT are attempting to arrange a meeting </p><p>with La Armeria representatives at the earliest possible </p><p>convenience in order to convey once again the legal and </p><p>procedural requirements necessary to import firearms and </p><p>ammunition from the United States. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
