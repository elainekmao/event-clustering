<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004212 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, EAID, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  Jordan Takes Major Step in Its Education </p><p>Initiative </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY:  The Jordanian Cabinet approved an $80 </p><p>million project as the first step in the provision of </p><p>providing broadband connectivity to all learning centers in </p><p>the country.  The centerpiece of the Jordan Education </p><p>Initiative (JEI), launched by King Abdullah at the World </p><p>Economic Forum (WEF) on June 21, the broadband project will </p><p>transform ninety-six "Discovery Schools" into model </p><p>facilities where information and communication technologies </p><p>(ICT) are innovatively integrated with education.  The JEI </p><p>relies heavily on US private sector participation for both </p><p>project formulation and implementation during the </p><p>preliminary stages.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On June 19, 2003 the Jordanian Cabinet approved an </p><p>$80 million project as part of its Jordan Broadband </p><p>Learning and Educational Network.   The proposed broadband </p><p>network initiative would upgrade the existing ADSL network, </p><p>currently connecting 1000 schools, by laying 5000 </p><p>kilometers of fiber to supply up to one gigabyte connection </p><p>speed.  The Ministry of Information and Communication </p><p>Technology (MOICT) hopes to have the 8 public universities </p><p>wired by September 2003, and the remaining 3000 schools, 23 </p><p>community colleges and 75 learning stations by fall 2006. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) During the final WEF Digital Divide Task Force </p><p>meeting in January 2003, a roundtable of IT and telecom </p><p>leaders selected Jordan to spearhead an education </p><p>initiative.  The JEI was the final project of the WEF </p><p>Digital Divide Task Force before its three  year mandate </p><p>expired.  King Abdullah officially launched the JEI at the </p><p>Extraordinary Annual Meeting of the WEF at the Dead Sea on </p><p>June 21, with IT luminaries Hewlett Packard CEO Carly </p><p>Fiorina and Sun Microsystems Chief Researcher John Gage in </p><p>attendance. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The JEI has three tracks: Discovery Schools, </p><p>Lifelong Learning, and Jordan ICT Industry Development. </p><p>The Discovery Schools track is designed to construct and </p><p>test a new model of ICT-enabled learning that other </p><p>developing countries can replicate.  The initiative uses </p><p>ninety-six schools as pilots to demonstrate how ICT can </p><p>facilitate learning, creativity and innovation.  The GOJ </p><p>has partnered with the Cisco Learning Institutes to develop </p><p>an e-curriculum, Intel to provide teacher training, and </p><p>Hewlett Packard to provide the in-classroom technology, </p><p>with other companies providing a variety of additional </p><p>support.  The GOJ challenged its private sector partners to </p><p>invent bold ways of utilizing technologies in the Discovery </p><p>Schools to facilitate educational reform in Jordan.  The </p><p>Lifelong Learning and ICT Industry Development tracks are </p><p>still being formulated. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Emile Cubeisy, Chief Information Officer at the </p><p>MOICT, expressed his appreciation to EconOff for the strong </p><p>level of participation from US private sector companies in </p><p>the Jordan Education Initiative.  He stressed the </p><p>sustainability of the JEI, citing an agreement between </p><p>Cisco and the GOJ that provides Cisco with a royalty from </p><p>software that is developed and sold as a result of the JEI. </p><p>He also noted that USAID funded programs such as INTAJ </p><p>(Jordanian IT business association) and INJAZ (a youth </p><p>entrepreneurship program) were playing a role in the JEI. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) COMMENT:  The MOICT plans to showcase the JEI at the </p><p>upcoming UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) </p><p>and is actively working with its Irish counterparts to </p><p>determine if the JEI can be used as a model for the broader </p><p>Irish and Swedish E-Schools initiative.  Although the MOICT </p><p>is beginning to implement the JEI, the success of the </p><p>initiative will not be evident by the time of the WSIS. </p><p>However, by December 2003, the private sector participants </p><p>will have cemented their contributions to the JEI, and </p><p>their willingness and methodology for engagement in this </p><p>innovative educational reform program will be apparent. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
