Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, the President of the UAE </p><p>General Women\'s Union and the wife of the President of the </p><p>UAE, has invited National Security Advisor Dr. Condoleezza </p><p>Rice and NEA Deputy Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Cheney to </p><p>attend the "First Economic Businesswomen Forum" in Abu </p><p>Dhabi scheduled for October 7 to October 10, 2003.  The </p><p>forum is cosponsored by the Arab League Council for Arab </p><p>Business Women, the General Women\'s Union, and the Abu </p><p>Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The topic of the </p><p>forum is "Projects for Businesswomen: Reality and </p><p>Ambitions," and it is designed to encourage further </p><p>participation by Arab women in the economies of their </p><p>respective countries. </p><p> </p><p>2. We understand that this forum replaces a long planned </p><p>conference, scheduled for October 5-6, hosted by the Abu </p><p>Dhabi World Trade Center and the Abu Dhabi Businesswomen\'s </p><p>Council, on "Arab Women in the 21st Century: First Economic </p><p>and Political Conference." The organizers have told Post </p><p>that, given the conflicting time schedule between the two </p><p>conferences, they have cancelled the October 5-6 </p><p>conference. </p><p> </p><p>3. According to the preliminary schedule provided by the </p><p>Women\'s Union, the conference will begin with a reception </p><p>followed by a dinner on October 6.  Work sessions are </p><p>scheduled for October 7 and 8 covering issues relating to </p><p>investment and women in business.  A trip to UAE President </p><p>Sheikh Zayed\'s nature reserve Sir Bani Yas Island is </p><p>scheduled for October 9.  A trip to Dubai - with shopping </p><p>and dinner - is scheduled for October 10. </p><p> </p><p>4. Post will pouch letters of invitation and a copy of the </p><p>schedule to the Department.  It is possible that some </p><p>details may change.  The Ambassador will engage with the </p><p>conference arrangers in the next week in order to obtain </p><p>more details.  A copy of the preliminary schedule will be </p><p>faxed to NEA/ARP. </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
