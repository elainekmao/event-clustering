<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000540 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, AF, CA, ISAF </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA SEARCHING FOR PARTNERS FOR ISAF IV AND V </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 435 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Since Defense Minister McCallum\'s February 12 </p><p>announcement that Canada would contribute a battalion and </p><p>brigade headquarters to ISAF IV and V (reftel), the GoC has </p><p>been busy seeking potential partners.  The GoC has stressed </p><p>that it does not have the resources to lead ISAF alone, and </p><p>it hopes to get confirmation in the next few weeks that </p><p>Germany will help lead ISAF IV.  For ISAF V, Canada is </p><p>looking at either Italy or Spain.  McCallum has spoken with </p><p>Italian Defense Minister Martino, and will be lobbying him </p><p>again during a June visit to Ottawa.  Canadian officials tell </p><p>us that while Spain\'s Parliament had decided not to </p><p>participate, during the Munich meetings German Defense </p><p>Minister Struck got his Spanish counterpart Trillo to agree </p><p>to take another look. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Canada wants quickly to begin negotiations on a </p><p>Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. military on support </p><p>for this mission, and is pushing for NATO support as well. </p><p>McCallum has said NATO participation is needed to help ensure </p><p>ISAF continuity.  Meanwhile, there continue to be misgivings </p><p>in the Canadian Forces about their ISAF contribution because </p><p>of its size and duration.  MGEN Cam Ross, Department of </p><p>National Defense (DND) Director General for International </p><p>Security Policy, resigned (effective in June) after the ISAF </p><p>announcement to protest what he saw as an over-commitment of </p><p>Canadian troops.  Ironically, Ross is leading a DND team that </p><p>is visiting Italy, Spain, and possibly Germany and NATO this </p><p>week to discuss ISAF force structure.  While Canada needs </p><p>another major partner for ISAF IV and V, DND also wants to </p><p>ensure that it has an appropriate tactical and leadership </p><p>role. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) To complement Canada\'s military contribution to ISAF, </p><p>Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) is pushing to open a diplomatic </p><p>mission in Kabul.  Cabinet has approved the concept of such a </p><p>mission, but DFAIT is now in a battle with the Treasury Board </p><p>over funding.  DFAIT currently covers Afghanistan from its </p><p>Embassy in Islamabad. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Critics of the GoC\'s ISAF commitment point to </p><p>the fact that Canada was unable to replace a battalion that </p><p>it pulled out of Afghanistan (where it was part of Operation </p><p>Enduring Freedom) after a 6-month stint last year.  While DND </p><p>did better than expected in the GoC budget announced earlier </p><p>this month - an increase of 7%, or $530 million, plus $215 </p><p>million additional for contingency operations - a 12-month </p><p>commitment to ISAF will be a major drain on the Canadian </p><p>Forces.  Canada will need all the help it can get from Allies </p><p>and, ideally, from NATO itself. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
