<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000484 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p>USUN FOR TWINING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSK GIVES PRESS A DOWNBEAT ASSESSMENT OF HER YEAR </p><p>OF FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  Aung San Suu Kyi told reporters and </p><p>diplomats April 23 that her trips to various regions of the </p><p>country reassured her that ethnic groups are anxious for </p><p>national reconciliation.  She provided details on how the </p><p>trips had been marred by attempts to intimidate NLD </p><p>supporters.  ASSK also said there has been no progress on her </p><p>dialogue with the SPDC and that relations have actually </p><p>"digressed" somewhat.  It is becoming clear, she said, that </p><p>the SPDC is simply not interested in national reconciliation. </p><p> She reiterated that basic NLD policies - on tourism, </p><p>sanctions, investment assistance - will not change until </p><p>there is real dialogue; however, the NLD stands ready to </p><p>cooperate on humanitarian assistance.  Publicly critical of </p><p>the regime for the first time since her release, ASSK </p><p>appeared to be ratcheting up the pressure, if only slightly, </p><p>for the regime to act on commitments for political </p><p>transition.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>One-year Assessment </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  In a press conference on April 23 at NLD </p><p>headquarters, Aung San Suu Kyi provided an assessment of </p><p>events since her release from house detention almost one year </p><p>ago, on May 6, 2002.  She divided her remarks into two </p><p>general themes: her travels around the country; and the </p><p>status of NLD relations with the regime.  Her travels, she </p><p>said, had demonstrated that the ethnic groups continue to </p><p>have a strong desire to work toward national reconciliation </p><p>if given a chance to participate in a "true union" of Burma. </p><p>She also cited examples, however, of how the trips have been </p><p>marred by authorities harassing her party and intimidating </p><p>people interested in seeing her.  Photos of her recent visit </p><p>to Chin State were on display showing, among other things, </p><p>the large crowds that turned out and the six offices that she </p><p>opened.  Also shown were photos of large logs laid across the </p><p>road to impede her progress by Union Solidarity and </p><p>Development Association (USDA) members and a group of USDA </p><p>members who confronted her party on several occasions.  ASSK </p><p>said that it was obvious that the USDA and Ministry officials </p><p>who visited Chin State to discourage people from turning out </p><p>for her visit were under orders from Rangoon.  She called on </p><p>the SPDC to clarify the role of the USDA and explain why it </p><p>has the power to take such actions if it is, as is claimed, </p><p>only a social and welfare organization. </p><p> </p><p>No Progress On Reconciliation </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  ASSK said it was very disappointing that since her </p><p>release last May, the SPDC has not made any attempts to move </p><p>forward with discussions on national reconciliation.  She </p><p>said that her release was supposed to mark a shift from </p><p>confidence building to more substantive exchanges including </p><p>discussions on national reconciliation.  Instead, relations </p><p>have been static and the SPDC seems to want to avoid any </p><p>motion towards national reconciliation.  ASSK made the </p><p>analogy of a child making excuses for not taking a bath; </p><p>after a point it becomes clear that the child just does not </p><p>want the bath.  She said that, based on the SPDC\'s continued </p><p>avoidance of discussions on national reconciliation the NLD </p><p>has had to conclude that the regime is just not interested. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  ASSK honed in on the insincerity of the SPDC\'s </p><p>claims that it wants national reconciliation by noting that </p><p>there has been no mention of the NLD or the SPDC\'s actions </p><p>towards the party in the local media.  The regime\'s comments </p><p>on reconciliation are always directed at the international </p><p>press and diplomats, she claimed, indicating that the </p><p>comments are intended only to mitigate international </p><p>criticism.  She called on the SPDC to explain why it has </p><p>never published any reports on confidence building, her </p><p>trips, or national reconciliation, in the local press. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  ASSK also took the SPDC to task for its poor </p><p>treatment of UN Special Envoy Razali, noting that if the </p><p>authorities were serious about achieving reconciliation they </p><p>would not restrict his travel to or activities within Burma. </p><p>Specifically, ASSK said the SPDC should not have blocked </p><p>Razali from visiting her in Taunggyi (Shan State) in November </p><p>2002 or delayed his visits to the country, as they are </p><p>reportedly currently doing. </p><p> </p><p>Policies Will Not Change Without Dialogue; Offer Stands For </p><p>Cooperation On Assistance </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  ASSK reiterated that with no dialogue on national </p><p>reconciliation, the NLD will not change its basic policies on </p><p>tourism, investment, sanctions, and assistance.  She noted </p><p>that the NLD has continued to make it known that it would </p><p>like to cooperate with the SPDC on humanitarian assistance </p><p>projects but, even on high visibility problems such as </p><p>HIV/AIDS, the authorities have indicated "they are not </p><p>interested in working together." </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  In response to a question from an Australian </p><p>reporter (ABC) on the Australian government\'s decision to </p><p>move toward engagement with the SPDC while the EU and U.S. </p><p>appear to be heading toward tighter sanctions, ASSK said she </p><p>had clearly communicated her disappointment to the Australian </p><p>government on its shift in policy.  She said the SPDC needs </p><p>to be reminded that maintaining the status quo is not </p><p>possible, change is inevitable and they should not attempt to </p><p>block it (noting that as Buddhists they should know and </p><p>accept this). </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Comment:  This was a more confrontational approach </p><p>from ASSK than we have seen since confidential talks began in </p><p>October 2000.  The lack of progress on dialogue one year </p><p>after her release from house detention, coupled with </p><p>continued and perhaps more systematic harassment on her trips </p><p>around the country, apparently prompted a slight shift in </p><p>strategy.  Still, she was somewhat cautious in her remarks </p><p>and reiterated several times that there are no personal </p><p>animosities between her and the SPDC and that she wants to </p><p>work together for national reconciliation.  She appeared to </p><p>be ratcheting up the pressure, albeit only slightly, for the </p><p>regime to act on previous commitments for political </p><p>transition.  We expect the regime will respond shortly with a </p><p>press conference of its own.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
