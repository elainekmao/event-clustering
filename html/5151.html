<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000094 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, T, PM, IO, DS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  01-16-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KTIA, MV, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  ICC Article 98:  Foreign Minister assures </p><p>Ammbassador that Maldives is actively reviewing proposal </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 26 (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) 02 Colombo 2323, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message contains Action Requests -- </p><p>Please see Paras 4-5. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador Wills spoke to Maldivian Foreign </p><p>Minister Fathulla Jameel on the telephone on January 16. </p><p>The Ambassador reiterated the U.S. proposal that the </p><p>Maldives sign as soon as possible a bilateral Article 98 </p><p>non-surrender agreement with the U.S.  The Ambassador </p><p>reviewed core U.S. points arguing for the proposal, </p><p>noting that Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, and Afghanistan in </p><p>the South Asian region have all signed non-surrender </p><p>agreements with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Foreign Minister Jameel replied that the </p><p>Maldivian government continued to review the U.S. </p><p>proposal actively.  It was being studied closely by the </p><p>MFA\'s legal department and other government offices. </p><p>The review was taking some time, but the government was </p><p>doing its very best.  Jameel added that he wanted the </p><p>U.S. to know that the Maldivian government would never </p><p>turn over a U.S. national to the International Criminal </p><p>Court (ICC).  The Maldivian government would not sign </p><p>the ICC treaty and would not respect its claim to </p><p>universal jurisdiction.  That said, the Foreign Minister </p><p>realized that the U.S. wanted something in writing.  He </p><p>said he would have something more definitive on the U.S. </p><p>proposal when the Ambassador visited Male on February 4. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT/ACTION REQUESTS:  As a very small country </p><p>with limited capacity, things move slowly in the </p><p>Maldives and this matter is going to take some more </p><p>time.  Mission will continue to press it at every </p><p>opportunity.  One possible next step may be for </p><p>Washington to provide Mission a copy of what India </p><p>signed with the U.S., which we understand did not </p><p>mention the ICC at all.  (Note:  We already provided the </p><p>GoRM a copy of what Sri Lanka signed with us.)  As the </p><p>Maldives models its foreign policy on New Delhi\'s to </p><p>some extent, it is possible that it would prefer to do </p><p>exactly what the GoI did.  In any case, providing the </p><p>GoRM a copy of what the Indians signed might be a good </p><p>way of continuing the dialogue until the Ambassador\'s </p><p>visit to Male in early February. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Mission also requests any releasable information </p><p>on where things stand re Pakistan and Bangladesh, two </p><p>South Asian countries that apparently have not signed </p><p>bilateral agreements.  Jameel expressed an interest in </p><p>this subject.  END COMMENT/ACTION REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
