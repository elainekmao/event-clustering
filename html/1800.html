IN AN INTERVIEW WITH CENTER- </p><p>LEFT ITALIAN DAILY "LA REPUBBLICA," THE CARDINAL DESCRIBED </p><p>THE "SEATTLE PEOPLE" AS A NEW CULTURAL PHENOMENON.

A 400-PAGE </p><p>REPORT, THE THIRD OF ITS KIND, PROVIDED INFORMATION OF THE </p><p>STATUS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN EACH OF THE WORLD\'S NATIONS. </p><p>IT ALSO PROVIDED STATISTICAL INFORMATION ON NUMBERS OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS AND REFUGEES. AID TO THE CHURCH IN NEED </p><p>ESTIMATES THAT 165,000 CHRISTIANS WERE KILLED LARGELY ON </p><p>ACCOUNT OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS DURING 2000. THE VIOLENCE </p><p>WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN INDONESIA, SUDAN, EAST TIMOR, INDIA </p><p>AND EGYPT. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, DISCRIMINATION AND LEGAL </p><p>SANCTIONS AGAINST CHRISTIANS WERE MOST OBVIOUS IN CHINA, </p><p>SUDAN, INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND TURKMENISTAN.

THE POPE </p><p>SAID XENOTRANSPLANT RESEARCH WAS IN THE INTEREST OF HUMANITY </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS LACK OF AVAILABLE HUMAN ORGANS, WHICH </p><p>HAS LED TO MANY TRANSPLANT PATIENTS DYING WHILE STILL ON </p><p>WAITING LISTS.
