The Customs Department report shows that Abu </p><p>Dhabi\'s oil exports continue to be the main engine of </p><p>the economy, in sharp contrast to better diversified </p><p>Dubai, where non-oil exports heavily exceed petroleum </p><p>sector revenues. Total Abu Dhabi non-oil exports for </p><p>the quarter were 96 million USD and re-exports 107 </p><p>million USD.  [Although we would hope that these </p><p>figures are accurate, there is a tendency here to </p><p>assign exaggerated valuations to the latter.] High oil </p><p>prices in the first quarter of 2003 also resulted in </p><p>greater income for Abu Dhabi, which no doubt inflated </p><p>the difference in comparison to the non-oil sector, </p><p>but the difference with regard to Dubai still remains </p><p>stark. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
