HUNDREDS OF MONTHS LATER, WE RECALL </p><p>THIS TO THE ARAB MINISTERS WHO CAME BACK FROM </p><p>WASHINGTON BEARING THE AFFIRMATIONS OF PRESIDENT BUSH, </p><p>HIS OPTIMISM, AND HIS CLARITY THAT THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>STATE WOULD BE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THREE YEARS, PROVIDED </p><p>THAT THE COUNTRIES WHO HAD ACCEPTED LORD CARADON\'S </p><p>INITIATIVE WOULD ONLY ACCEPT TO END TERRORISM, END </p><p>CORRUPTION, AND PRODUCE AN ACCEPTABLE PALESTINIAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP.

IS IT SUFFICIENT FOR THE U.S. </p><p>TO DICTATE THIS POSITION TO ARAB MINISTERS WHILE </p><p>ISRAELI EXPANSION AND SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY CONTINUE? </p><p>WHAT GUARANTEES DO THE PARTICIPATING ARAB COUNTRIES </p><p>OFFER US THAT THE REQUIRED ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL WOULD </p><p>TAKE PLACE, AND THAT PALESTINIANS WOULD RECOVER THEIR </p><p>LEGITIMATE RIGHTS? WHAT ARE THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS THAT </p><p>THE MINISTERS TALK ABOUT, WHICH NO ONE OTHER THAN THEM </p><p>CAN SEE IN THE AMERICAN POSITION THAT IS TOTALLY BIASED </p><p>TO ISRAEL AND THAT CALLS FOR ENDING PALESTINIAN </p><p>NATIONAL REPRESENTATION?" </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TRIPARTITE DELEGATION RETURNS OPTIMISTIC </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST JAMIL AL-NIMRI WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY 22: "THE MAIN </p><p>POINT SCORED BY THE DELEGATION IS THAT THEY MOVED BUSH </p><p>AWAY FROM HIS INSISTENCE ON REMOVING ARAFAT, IN FAVOR </p><p>OF A FORMULA WHEREBY HE WOULD HAVE DIMINISHED POWER. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WOULD BE AN AMERICAN-ARAB </p><p>MANDATE ON PALESTINIAN REFORMS.
