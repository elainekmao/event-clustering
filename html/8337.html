<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000910 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, EUR/NB, EAP/J; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 05/29/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, EAID, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Norwegians deliver GSL proposal re assistance </p><p>to the Tigers, who indicate they need time to review it </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 897 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 874 </p><p>-      (C) Oslo 1049 </p><p>-      (D) Tokyo 3334 (All Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Norwegian facilitators delivered </p><p>the latest GSL proposal re assistance to the Tigers late </p><p>May 28.  The Tigers indicated that they need time to </p><p>review it.  The government is only beginning to brief </p><p>the public on the matter, but, based on what we are </p><p>hearing, the proposal would go some way toward providing </p><p>the Tigers an important -- if not dictatorial -- voice </p><p>in assistance delivery in the north/east.  Whether the </p><p>proposal suits the Tigers\' fancy and gets them to the </p><p>upcoming Tokyo conference remain unclear.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Norwegians deliver Proposal to LTTE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Norwegian government facilitators delivered the </p><p>latest GSL proposal re assistance delivery to the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) late May 28. </p><p>(Note:  The proposal forms the GSL\'s response to the </p><p>LTTE\'s recent demand for an "interim administrative </p><p>structure" in the north/east that would control </p><p>assistance delivery and that would be dominated by the </p><p>group -- see Refs A-B.  See below for more on the nature </p><p>of the proposal.)  From our understanding, the stop by </p><p>the Norwegian Embassy representatives, including </p><p>polchief Tomas Stangeland, in the LTTE-controlled </p><p>northern Sri Lanka town of Kilinochchi was quite brief. </p><p>The Norwegians reportedly got off the Sri Lankan </p><p>government helicopter to deliver the document to the </p><p>LTTE political office and then got back on for the </p><p>flight back to Colombo.  On receipt of the document, </p><p>LTTE officials indicated that the group would need at </p><p>least several days to study it before responding. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) (((Note:  Norwegian Special Envoy Erik Solheim, </p><p>who left Colombo bound for Europe last night, did not </p><p>travel to Kilinochchi.  It was originally envisaged that </p><p>Solheim -- who has long experience in dealing with the </p><p>Tigers -- would provide the proposal to the LTTE on </p><p>May 27.  The Tigers postponed that meeting for reasons </p><p>that remain unclear.  It is possible, but not confirmed, </p><p>that Solheim may meet the LTTE\'s London-based spokesman </p><p>Anton Balasingham soon.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Proposal\'s Elements become Clearer </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The exact contents of the government\'s proposal </p><p>to the LTTE have not yet been published, but its key </p><p>elements -- if not the precise details -- are becoming </p><p>available.  Minister for Economic Reform Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, for example, chaired a meeting of donor and </p><p>international financial institution (IFI) </p><p>representatives on May 28 to review the matter.  (Note: </p><p>Moragoda left Colombo later in the day bound for Tokyo </p><p>to review preparations for the donors conference with </p><p>the Japanese government.)  At Moragoda\'s request, Peter </p><p>Harrold, World Bank representative, briefed on the GSL </p><p>response to LTTE demands for more control of assistance </p><p>projects.  (Note:  The document Harrold briefed on -- </p><p>which was apparently the text of what was provided by </p><p>the Norwegians to the Tigers -- was not provided to </p><p>those at the meeting.  Moragoda said the government did </p><p>not want to release the document at this time, as it was </p><p>still under review by the LTTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In his briefing, Harrold sketched out a complex </p><p>scheme explaining the GSL\'s proposed assistance </p><p>"delivery mechanism."  (Note:  In its rough form, the </p><p>scheme Harrold previewed seemed to have a lot in common </p><p>with what the Ambassador heard in a May 24 meeting </p><p>chaired by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe -- see Ref B.) </p><p>Harrold said there would be an "apex" body, appointed by </p><p>both parties (government and LTTE), which would set </p><p>policy and priorities for assistance.  This body would </p><p>also provide oversight of North-East Reconstruction Fund </p><p>(NERF) projects, and other projects funded by donors who </p><p>cannot contribute to NERF.  (Note:  The general idea is </p><p>to give the LTTE a "major" but not a "majority" say in </p><p>what happens to the aid to the NE.)  An institutional </p><p>structure headed by a "commissioner" would carry out the </p><p>work through GSL agencies and donors.  Finally, a </p><p>"consultative committee" of donors would review progress </p><p>and ensure the inclusion of all communities (especially </p><p>Muslims, who are threatened by the LTTE in the east and </p><p>feel left out of the peace process).  When queried as to </p><p>whether the proposal might be acceptable to the LTTE, </p><p>Norwegians representatives at the meeting said they did </p><p>not expect a quick response from the group, but hoped </p><p>for a substantive counterproposal. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Japanese Embassy representative at the </p><p>meeting also provided a document containing general </p><p>information on the Tokyo conference, which is scheduled </p><p>to take place June 9-10.  (Note:  This document has been </p><p>faxed to SA/INS.)  The Japanese representative said 56 </p><p>countries and 20 international organizations had said </p><p>they would likely attend the conference.  Only one seat </p><p>at the table, and two seats behind that, would be </p><p>available for each delegation in the conference hall, </p><p>the GoJ emboff related.  Other delegates would have to </p><p>watch the proceedings in a nearby "monitoring room." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  Those present at the May 28 meeting </p><p>were also briefed on a document, which essentially </p><p>bridges the "Regaining Sri Lanka" initiative and the </p><p>recent IFI assessment of needs in the north and east, </p><p>by combining them.  This document has also been faxed to </p><p>SA/INS.  Significant in it is the estimate of the gap in </p><p>GSL financing for 2003-2006.  Coverage of these totals </p><p>is what the government will be seeking in Tokyo. </p><p>Deficits range from $441 - $551 million each year.))) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>GSL begins to sell Proposal to the Public </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) While gliding lightly over the complex </p><p>details, the government has begun to review its </p><p>potentially controversial proposal with the Sri Lankan </p><p>public.  In widely quoted remarks made on May 28, </p><p>government spokesman and Minister of Constitutional </p><p>Affairs G.L. Peiris said he hoped the LTTE accepted the </p><p>GSL\'s proposal and agreed to come to the Tokyo </p><p>conference.  Re the proposal, he commented that the GSL </p><p>had "formulated a set up of ideas for the creation of a </p><p>development oriented structure in the northeast for the </p><p>effective implementation of the rehabilitation and </p><p>reconstruction of the region."  Peiris went on to insist </p><p>that the GSL\'s proposal was well within Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>legal system and was fully consistent with the current </p><p>constitution.  (Note:  In May 29 public remarks, PM </p><p>Wickremesinghe urged the Tigers to be flexible and "more </p><p>understanding," so as to allow the peace process to move </p><p>forward.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Whether the government\'s latest proposal suits </p><p>the Tigers\' fancy and gets them to the upcoming Tokyo </p><p>conference are still very unclear.  The group has made </p><p>some tough demands and the GSL\'s current proposal does </p><p>not seem to give them the almost total control of </p><p>assistance delivery in the north/east that they want. </p><p>That said, the government has certainly come a long, </p><p>long way and the LTTE will probably review the proposal </p><p>quite closely.  Getting the Tigers to climb out of the </p><p>hole they have dug themselves in time for Tokyo may be </p><p>difficult, however.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
