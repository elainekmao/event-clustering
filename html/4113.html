<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002022 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, PM, PM/HDP </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PHUM, PREF, KPAO, EAID, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  U.S.-sponsored Quick Reaction Demining Force </p><p>successfully completes operations in Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1415, and previous </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- </p><p>Please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) After approximately seven months of operations, </p><p>the U.S.-sponsored Quick Reaction Demining Force (QRDF) </p><p>has wrapped up its work in Sri Lanka.  On October 24-25, </p><p>the QRDF turned over two plots of land cleared to </p><p>international humanitarian demining standards to GSL </p><p>authorities. (Note:  The QRDF-demined land was the first </p><p>ever cleared in Sri Lanka to humanitarian mine clearance </p><p>standards.)  The land was located in the Sarasalai area </p><p>of Jaffna near the war-torn town of Chavakachcheri.  The </p><p>final figures for the QRDF demining operation were: </p><p> </p><p>-- 122,348 square meters cleared </p><p>-- 980 anti-personnel mines removed </p><p>-- 42 pieces of unexploded ordnance (UXO) removed </p><p> </p><p>As part of the turnover, the QRDF gave the GSL about </p><p>USD 15,000 worth of generators, demining explosives, and </p><p>other items. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  Mission is faxing SA/INS copies of the QRDF\'s </p><p>completion records, including a list of the items given </p><p>to the GSL.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The QRDF effort has received widespread </p><p>acclaim in Sri Lanka.  It began its operations in April </p><p>in response to a specific request made by Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe to SA A/S Rocca during her March visit to </p><p>Jaffna.  While performing practical work that is </p><p>allowing for the safe return of displaced persons to the </p><p>demined area, the QRDF became a symbol of U.S. support </p><p>for the peace process, engendering highly positive press </p><p>coverage for the U.S. in the process.  Deputy Secretary </p><p>Armitage\'s widely publicized August visit to the QRDF\'s </p><p>demining site in Jaffna encapsulated all of these </p><p>positive threads.  The U.S. has reaped these kudos all </p><p>to itself; despite repeated requests by the GSL, no </p><p>other country has pitched in to help in actual demining </p><p>other than the U.S.  (Note:  The UN demining effort </p><p>continues to tread water, while a HALO Trust operation </p><p>is just starting up.)  With the QRDF\'s departure, the </p><p>next step in U.S. demining assistance is a large-scale </p><p>DoD-run training program for Sri Lankan military </p><p>personnel and civilians that is slated to start in early </p><p>2003.  (Note:  Mission has also requested FY-04 funds </p><p>for additional demining projects.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) To commemorate the QRDF and outline next steps </p><p>in U.S. support, Mission plans to issue a press release </p><p>along the following lines on October 30: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN DRAFT TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>U.S. DEMINING GROUP SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES OPERATIONS </p><p> </p><p>The U.S.-sponsored Quick Reaction Demining Force (QRDF) </p><p>has completed its work in Sri Lanka.  On October 24-25, </p><p>the QRDF turned over two plots of land cleared of mines </p><p>and explosives to Sri Lankan government authorities. </p><p>The demined land was the first ever cleared in Sri Lanka </p><p>to humanitarian mine clearance standards, allowing </p><p>civilians to return to their land without fear.  The </p><p>cleared land was located in the Sarasalai area of Jaffna </p><p>near the town of Chavakachcheri.  The final figures for </p><p>the QRDF demining operation were: </p><p> </p><p>- 122,348 square meters cleared to a humanitarian </p><p>standard </p><p>- 980 anti-personnel mines removed </p><p>- 42 pieces of unexploded ordnance (UXO) removed </p><p> </p><p>As part of the turnover, the QRDF provided about </p><p>USD 15,000 worth of items to Sri Lankan authorities for </p><p>use in its demining effort. </p><p>The U.S. remains fully committed to supporting </p><p>humanitarian mine clearance in Sri Lanka, which we see </p><p>as serving to reinforce the peace process.  The next </p><p>step in U.S. demining assistance is establishment of a </p><p>humanitarian mine clearance training program for </p><p>Sri Lankan civilians and military personnel that is </p><p>scheduled to begin operations in early 2003. </p><p> </p><p>END DRAFT TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
