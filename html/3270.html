<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 003716 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM AND NEA; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRWA BRIEFING HIGHLIGHTS USD 55.7 MILLION IN NEW </p><p>NEEDS, HINTS AT INCREASED ISRAELI COOPERATION ON </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ACCESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2999 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM GREG BERRY, PER 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  On July 2, UNRWA Deputy Commissioner </p><p>General Karen AbuZayd briefed donors on UNRWA\'s USD 55.7 </p><p>million in new financial needs following the March-April </p><p>military operations in the West Bank and Gaza.  UNRWA warned </p><p>that its 2002 emergency appeal remains severely underfunded, </p><p>with pledges of only USD 53.2 million of the original USD 117 </p><p>million appeal.  Without significant new contributions, UNRWA </p><p>warned that it will be unable to implement emergency programs </p><p>after September 30.  UNRWA also reported that it has seen </p><p>signs that Israel may be attempting to resolve the agency\'s </p><p>longstanding humanitarian access difficulties; following </p><p>meetings with IDF and MATAK officials (held at their </p><p>request), UNRWA finally received permission to deliver to </p><p>Gaza 42 tons of medical supplies that had been held at </p><p>UNRWA\'s Jerusalem warehouse for the last 22 months.  UNRWA </p><p>West Bank Director Cook also reported that MATAK has asked </p><p>UNRWA to institute regularly scheduled meetings to resolve </p><p>such disputes.  While our interlocutors found the news </p><p>encouraging, some skeptics questioned the Israelis\' motives </p><p>-- especially given recent Israeli government statements </p><p>critical of UNRWA.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On July 2, UNRWA Deputy Commissioner General Karen </p><p>AbuZayd briefed donors in Jerusalem and Amman on UNRWA\'s USD </p><p>55.7 million in new financial needs following the March-April </p><p>military operations in the West Bank and Gaza.  AbuZayd was </p><p>accompanied by West Bank Director Richard Cook and Gaza </p><p>Deputy Director Kris Nordahl, who provided detailed updates </p><p>on the humanitarian situation in their respective fields. </p><p>Regional refugee coordinator and refugee assistant attended </p><p>the Amman briefing. </p><p> </p><p>GRIM FINANCIAL PICTURE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Deputy ComGen Karen AbuZayd reported that UNRWA\'s </p><p>original 2002 emergency appeal remains severely underfunded, </p><p>with pledges to date of only USD 53.2 million of the original </p><p>USD 117 million appeal.  Without significant new pledges, she </p><p>warned, UNRWA will be unable to implement emergency programs </p><p>after September 30.  Due to both limited financial resources </p><p>and the curfews and closures in the West Bank, UNRWA has been </p><p>able to implement only 22 percent of its job creation </p><p>programs, one-third of its community works programs, 28 </p><p>percent of its emergency health programs and one of its two </p><p>scheduled food distributions in the West Bank.  In Gaza, </p><p>UNRWA\'s short-term employment programs can continue through </p><p>October, but the agency will be unable to distribute </p><p>emergency food assistance after September. </p><p> </p><p>MADE STILL WORSE BY ADDITIONAL NEEDS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In a supplemental appeal issued on June 20, UNRWA </p><p>reported that it faces USD 55.7 million in additional </p><p>financial needs resulting from the March-April military </p><p>operations in the West Bank and Gaza.  The majority of these </p><p>new needs, some USD 28 million, is required to rebuild Jenin </p><p>refugee camp.  West Bank Director Cook reported that these </p><p>reconstruction expenses (which include infrastructure and </p><p>administrative support costs) should be covered by a still </p><p>unconfirmed USD 30 million pledge by the UAE.  (UNRWA still </p><p>is negotiating with the UAE over the expenses that will be </p><p>covered by the donation.  The UAE insists that only </p><p>construction costs should be covered, while UNRWA is pushing </p><p>for social services costs as well.)  Other significant new </p><p>needs include USD 6.9 million in additional shelter </p><p>reconstruction in Gaza; USD 2.5 million in West Bank shelter </p><p>reconstruction and repairs outside Jenin camp; USD 2.4 </p><p>million in non-Jenin infrastructure repairs in the West Bank </p><p>and USD 1.25 million in additional emergency food aid for the </p><p>West Bank. </p><p> </p><p>SITUATION IN WEST BANK "VERY, VERY DIFFICULT" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) UNRWA West Bank Director Richard Cook told donors </p><p>that although the intensity of fighting had diminished in the </p><p>West Bank, the situation is still "very, very difficult," as </p><p>the West Bank is undergoing the "tightest, most intense and </p><p>prolonged closure" UNRWA has ever known.  Due to daily IDF </p><p>incursions and curfews throughout the West Bank, it is nearly </p><p>impossible for UNRWA\'s 4,200 Palestinian staff to move around </p><p>the West Bank or report to the Jerusalem field office.  Cook </p><p>added that the 392 Jerusalem permits required for UNRWA\'s </p><p>West Bank field office staff still have not been renewed. </p><p>Nevertheless, an average of ten staff per day manage to reach </p><p>the field office from the West Bank, in violation of Israeli </p><p>laws and at great personal risk.  To manage operations </p><p>without those who are unable to reach Jerusalem, UNRWA has </p><p>set up internet workstations in some of its West Bank </p><p>installations, enabling employees to telecommute where </p><p>possible.  To lead convoys and conduct food distributions, </p><p>the West Bank field still is relying on 12 international </p><p>drivers provided by the Swedish consulate. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Cook said the continued closures are affecting </p><p>"every aspect of life" in the West Bank.  Although UNRWA had </p><p>made plans to extend the school year by 10 to 30 days in the </p><p>West Bank, to make up for the tens of thousands of teacher </p><p>days lost to closures, the continued tight closures and </p><p>curfews are making it impossible for teachers to reach their </p><p>schools.  In response to a donor question, Cook said that </p><p>UNRWA probably will be able to make up for lost classroom </p><p>time in the next school year -- assuming the school year </p><p>proceeds without significant closures or curfews -- but that </p><p>the lost classroom time will have a significant, </p><p>unrecoverable effect on students if such disruptions continue </p><p>beyond this summer. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In the health sector, Cook reported that the </p><p>continued closures are having a particularly difficult effect </p><p>on refugees with chronic illnesses such as cancer, kidney </p><p>failure or heart disease who require regular treatments.  In </p><p>the last seven days of June, for example, 33 of UNRWA\'s 34 </p><p>West Bank health centers were closed for at least one day. </p><p>UNRWA also is coping with an increased number of refugees in </p><p>need of physical therapy.  Cook reported that 80 refugees </p><p>resident in the West Bank are in need of life-time physical </p><p>rehabilitation care following the March-April incursions, </p><p>including 46 in Jenin camp. </p><p> </p><p>JENIN CAMP UPDATE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Due to the continuing problems of unexploded </p><p>ordnance (UXO) and ongoing IDF incursions into Jenin, UNRWA\'s </p><p>reconstruction efforts are proceeding slowly, often only at </p><p>three to four-hour intervals per day.  At this rate, and </p><p>without the necessary UXO removal equipment (ref), UNRWA </p><p>estimates that it will take at least nine months to remove </p><p>all of the rubble from Jenin refugee camp.  In the meantime, </p><p>a total of 35 Palestinian refugees have been wounded and two </p><p>killed by UXO since mid-April. </p><p> </p><p>GAZA CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) UNRWA\'s Deputy Gaza Director Kris Nordahl reported </p><p>that the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to </p><p>deteriorate.  215 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since </p><p>March 1, and the demolition and bulldozing of Palestinian </p><p>refugees\' property continues.  516 Palestinian refugee </p><p>shelters have been demolished since September 2000, including </p><p>418 families still in need of new shelter.  From early March </p><p>until early May, the Gaza Strip was trisected by Israeli </p><p>checkpoints and 750 UNRWA employees were unable to report to </p><p>work.  As a result, the Gaza Men\'s and Women\'s Training </p><p>Centers were closed for 60 days.  UNRWA\'s medical specialists </p><p>(cardiologists, ob/gyns and opthamologists), who work in </p><p>clinics throughout Gaza, also were unable to work for 60 </p><p>days.  Now that Gaza is only bisected by checkpoints, UNRWA </p><p>staff and Training Center students are able to move through </p><p>the Strip, although it can take four to seven hours to make a </p><p>one-way journey.  Nordahl reported that UNRWA\'s food </p><p>distribution program was severely delayed by the closures, as </p><p>UNRWA was not allowed to import commodities until May 29. </p><p>Due to the internal closures, UNRWA still is not allowed to </p><p>distribute food to the impoverished southern al-Mawassi </p><p>enclave.  Nordahl reported also that Gaza\'s already weakened </p><p>economy deteriorated still further following the March-May </p><p>closures, as even internal construction projects Gaza ground </p><p>to a halt.  UNRWA has increased its selective cash assistance </p><p>in Gaza by 45 percent to combat growing unemployment, and </p><p>seeks an additional USD 1 million in emergency funding to </p><p>further increase this assistance. </p><p> </p><p>SOME SIGNS ACCESS MAY BE IMPROVING, BUT PROBLEMS REMAIN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) UNRWA reported that it has seen some signs that </p><p>Israel may be attempting to resolve the agency\'s longstanding </p><p>access difficulties.  During the week of June 24, former </p><p>MATAK commander General Spiegel met with UNRWA officials as </p><p>part of the Israeli Government\'s ongoing review of IDF </p><p>actions during Operation Defensive Shield.  West Bank </p><p>Director Richard Cook reported that Spiegel listened </p><p>carefully to UNRWA\'s complaints, took notes, and made no </p><p>attempt to argue or defend IDF actions that violated UNRWA\'s </p><p>immunities or mandate.  UNRWA\'s regular IDF liaison and the </p><p>MATAK West Bank Commander then followed up with separate </p><p>requests for briefings and regularly scheduled meetings with </p><p>UNRWA officials.  Cook told donors that he has had more </p><p>contact with MATAK and the IDF in the last few days than he </p><p>had had during his previous five years of service in the West </p><p>Bank.  He also reported that, as a result of these meetings, </p><p>Israeli authorities finally granted UNRWA permission to </p><p>deliver to Gaza the 42 tons of medical supplies held in </p><p>UNRWA\'s Jerusalem warehouse since September 2000 due to </p><p>Israeli security restrictions.  In Gaza, although UNRWA </p><p>continues to have internal distribution and staff access </p><p>problems, UNRWA reported that Israeli authorities have opened </p><p>Sufa crossing exclusively for UNRWA containers.  According to </p><p>Gaza Deputy Director Nordahl, the Israelis have not allowed </p><p>any other organization to import containers into Gaza. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) While our interlocutors at the briefing found the </p><p>reports of increased Israeli cooperation on humanitarian </p><p>access issues encouraging, some skeptics questioned Israeli </p><p>motives -- especially given recent Israeli government </p><p>statements critical of UNRWA.  Following the briefing, for </p><p>example, one host country representative speculated to </p><p>refcoord that perhaps the Israelis were easing restrictions </p><p>on UNRWA as part of their master plan to displace Arafat -- </p><p>as it would be impossible for the Palestinians (and Israel) </p><p>to weather such a political crisis without a fully </p><p>functioning international relief system. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
