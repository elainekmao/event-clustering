REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN AN HOUR-LONG MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN ON </p><p>OCTOBER 18, PRESIDENT MUGABE THANKED THE U.S. FOR ITS ROLE IN </p><p>SUPPORTING ZIMBABWEAN INDEPENDENCE AND FOR ITS SIGNIFICANT </p><p>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SINCE 1980.  HE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON AND PROMISED </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S COOPERATION IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM.  MUGABE </p><p>DELIVERED A 40-MINUTE HISTORY LESSON ON THE LAND QUESTION, IN </p><p>WHICH THE BRITISH WERE THE PRIMARY VILLAINS.  HE REJECTED </p><p>CRITICISM THAT ZIMBABWE IS PLAGUED BY LAWLESSNESS, BLAMING THAT </p><p>PERCEPTION ON BRITISH PROPAGANDA, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THE OCCURRENCE </p><p>OF "ISOLATED INCIDENTS." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT RECALLED THAT ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>HAD BEEN WELCOMED IN EVERY ELECTION SINCE INDEPENDENCE, BUT HE WAS </p><p>SUSPICIOUS THAT SOME IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SEEMED "TOO </p><p>EAGER" TO OBSERVE THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL VOTE.  HE SAID THE GOZ </p><p>WOULD ALSO WELCOME OBSERVERS THIS TIME, BUT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE </p><p>IMPARTIAL, AND SAID THE ELECTION WOULD BE HELD ON TIME, BEFORE THE </p><p>END OF MARCH 2002.  AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN PRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>NON-VIOLENCE IN LAND REFORM AND THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN, AND </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF PERMITTING THE PARTICIPATION OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS.  HE DESCRIBED THE BONA FIDES OF </p><p>THE U.S.-BASED INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR ELECTION SYSTEMS </p><p>(IFES), AND ADVOCATED THAT ITS ADMISSION TO ZIMBABWE WELL IN </p><p>ADVANCE OF THE ELECTION WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE GOZ\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03131  01 OF 04  191134Z </p><p>CONDUCTING A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION.

(U) AFTER PRESENTING HIS CREDENTIALS TO PRESIDENT MUGABE ON </p><p>OCTOBER 18, AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN MET WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT </p><p>FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR.  THE PRESIDENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER MUDENGE, MFA DIRECTOR OF PROTOCOL NGONI CHIDEYA, AND MFA </p><p>AMERICAS DESK OFFICER RICHARD CHIBUWE.  THE AMBASSADOR WAS JOINED </p><p>BY THE DCM, PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER, DATT, ACTING USAID DIRECTOR, </p><p>AND POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. - ZIMBABWE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE WELCOMED AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN TO ZIMBABWE </p><p>AND CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS APPOINTMENT.  HE PRAISED THE UNITED </p><p>STATES\' ROLE IN HELPING FOSTER ZIMBABWEAN INDEPENDENCE, AND </p><p>EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. SUPPORT SINCE 1980.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>SULLIVAN AGREED THAT THE UNITED STATES AND ZIMBABWE HAVE ENJOYED </p><p>GOOD RELATIONS OVER THE YEARS.  WE HAD OPPOSED THE IAN SMITH </p><p>REGIME, HE RECALLED, AND HAVE PROVIDED MORE THAN $700 MILLION IN </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO ZIMBABWE SINCE INDEPENDENCE.  THE USG, HE CONTINUED, </p><p>WAS CURRENTLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE GOZ IN THE AREAS OF </p><p>INFECTIOUS DISEASES, DEMINING, AND PARLIAMENTARY STRENGTHENING. </p><p> </p><p>WAR AGAINST TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUGABE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE GOZ, HE SAID, HAD WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03131  01 OF 04  191134Z </p><p>EMBASSY TO STRENGTHEN SECURITY AFTER THE 1998 ATTACKS ON EMBASSIES </p><p>NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM, AND STILL HAS THE SAME INCLINATION TO </p><p>COOPERATE.  MUGABE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PRESENCE IN ZIMBABWE OF SOME </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT WANT TO ENGAGE IN UNSAVORY ACTIVITIES, BUT </p><p>HE URGED THAT "WE WATCH THEM CLOSELY TOGETHER."  HE EXPRESSED </p><p>WORRY ABOUT THE GROWING ANTHRAX THREAT, NOTING THAT SEVERAL </p><p>MEMBERS OF HIS OWN FAMILY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN INFECTED WITH THE </p><p>DISEASE.  AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN THANKED MUGABE FOR THE OUTSTANDING </p><p>SUPPORT THE EMBASSY HAS RECEIVED FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION (CIO) AND THE ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE (ZRP)IN HELPING </p><p>US FEEL MORE SECURE IN OUR FACILITIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE AFTERMATH OF </p><p> </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11.  HE URGED THE GOZ TO TAKE OTHER CONCRETE STEPS IN </p><p>THE BROADER WAR AGAINST TERRORISM, SUCH AS RATIFYING THE REMAINING </p><p>NINE UN COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS IT HAS NOT YET RATIFIED. </p><p>MUGABE WAS NONCOMMITTAL, NOTING THAT RATIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONVENTIONS REQUIRED A PROTRACTED AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>LAND </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MUGABE BEGAN WITH HIS DETAILED PERSPECTIVE ON THE HISTORY </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE\'S LAND QUESTION.  HE NOTED THAT "WE WEREN\'T QUITE </p><p>HAPPY" WITH THE LANCASTER HOUSE CONSTITUTION FOR SEVERAL REASONS, </p><p>INCLUDING ITS PROVISIONS ON LAND.  FOR INSTANCE, IT REQUIRED THAT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO1931 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03131  02 OF 04  191134Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------31BD14  191134Z /38 </p><p>P 191101Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0073 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 003131 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 10/19/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MUGABE AND AMBASSADOR DISCUSS TERRORISM, LAND, </p><p>AND ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03131  02 OF 04  191134Z </p><p>THE ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR THE PURPOSES OF RESETTLEMENT BE </p><p>IMPLEMENTED ON A "WILLING SELLER, WILLING BUYER" BASIS, WHICH </p><p>PLACED SERIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S CAPACITY TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT LAND REFORM.  THE UNITED STATES, MUGABE SAID, HAD HELPED </p><p>BREAK THE DEADLOCK IN NEGOTIATIONS BY PROMISING TO SUPPLEMENT </p><p>BRITISH ASSISTANCE FOR LAND REFORM AND TO ENCOURAGE OTHER DONORS </p><p>TO CONTRIBUTE.  IN THE EARLY 1990\'S, GOVERNMENT PASSED THE LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION ACT, WHICH ALLOWED THE GOVERNMENT TO ACQUIRE LAND SO </p><p>LONG AS IT WAS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST.  IT DID NOT "TAMPER" WITH </p><p>THE REQUIREMENT FOR COMPENSATION, AS GOVERNMENT EXPECTED THE </p><p>UNITED KINGDOM TO HONOR ITS LANCASTER HOUSE COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE </p><p>THE NECESSARY FUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ACCORDING TO MUGABE, MARGARET THATCHER DID HER BEST TO </p><p>HONOR THE BRITISH COMMITMENT BY PROVIDING SOME ASSISTANCE, BUT </p><p>THOSE FUNDS SOON RAN OUT.  ZIMBABWE WAS THEN FACED WITH HAVING TO </p><p>COMPENSATE FARMOWNERS WHO HAD NEVER BOUGHT THEIR LAND IN THE FIRST </p><p>PLACE.  OUR VIEW, MUGABE EMPHASIZED, WAS AND REMAINS THAT </p><p>PROVIDING SUCH COMPENSATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BRITISH. </p><p>FORMER BRITISH PM JOHN MAJOR RECOGNIZED THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND </p><p>WAS WORKING ON A GOOD ASSISTANCE PACKAGE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE WHEN HE WAS DEFEATED FOR REELECTION.  HIS SUCCESSOR TONY </p><p>BLAIR REFUSED TO HONOR THE COMMITMENTS OF HIS CONSERVATIVE PARTY </p><p>PREDECESSORS.  IN A FURTHER SLAP TO THE GOZ, BLAIR\'S DEVELOPMENT </p><p>MINISTER CLARE SHORT DISMISSED THE IDEA THAT BRITAIN WAS OBLIGATED </p><p>TO PAY COMPENSATION, POINTING OUT THAT, AS AN IRISHWOMAN, SHE HAD </p><p>HAD HER OWN EXPERIENCES WITH COLONIALISM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) AT THAT POINT, MUGABE EXPLAINED, THE GOZ DECIDED TO </p><p>PROCEED ON ITS OWN TERMS.  IT WOULD PROVIDE COMPENSATION ONLY FOR </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS TO ACQUIRED LAND AND WOULD APPROPRIATE THE FARMS ONLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03131  02 OF 04  191134Z </p><p>OF THOSE OWNERS POSSESSING MULTIPLE PROPERTIES.  IN MOST CASES, </p><p>NEITHER OWNERS OF SINGLE FARMS NOR OF AGRO-INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS </p><p>WOULD BE AFFECTED.  IN RARE CIRCUMSTANCES, SINGLE FARM-OWNERS </p><p>MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR PROPERTY IF IT IS ADJACENT TO A </p><p>COMMUNAL AREA, BUT THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS SITUATION </p><p>WOULD BE GIVEN ANOTHER FARM ELSEWHERE.  NO FARMER, MUGABE </p><p>INSISTED, WOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT ANY PROPERTY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR CONVEYED THE USG\'S STRONG BELIEF IN THE </p><p>NEED TO ADDRESS THE HISTORICAL INEQUITIES IN LAND OWNERSHIP, AND </p><p>SAID WE WOULD LIKE TO BE SUPPORTIVE.  THE USG, HOWEVER, COULD ONLY </p><p>SUPPORT A NON-VIOLENT LAND REFORM PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED WITHIN A </p><p>LEGAL FRAMEWORK SUCH AS THE ABUJA AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>RULE OF LAW </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE HAD HOSTILE WORDS FOR THE BRITISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND TONY BLAIR IN PARTICULAR, WHOM HE CALLED THAT </p><p>"MADMAN AT NUMBER 10 DOWNING STREET."  BLAIR, HE SAID, DESCRIBES </p><p>ZIMBABWE AS A VIOLATOR OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OF HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT </p><p>THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER SHOULD "READ OUR HISTORY." DURING THE </p><p>IAN SMITH REGIME, MUGABE RECALLED, HE HAD SPENT ELEVEN YEARS IN </p><p>PRISON, AND HIS MOTHER NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE REASON WHY.  THERE WAS </p><p>NO RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS THEN, BUT THE BRITISH DID NOT SEEM </p><p>CONCERNED.  "DO YOU THINK I CAN LISTEN TO SUCH CRITICISM FROM TONY </p><p>BLAIR," THE PRESIDENT ASKED, "WHEN I KNOW THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN </p><p>IN THIS COUNTRY?"  BLAIR AND HIS ADVISORS, MUGABE SAID </p><p>DISMISSIVELY, WERE IN SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS FIGHTING FOR </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, AND "NOW THEY THINK THEY ARE OUR MASTERS." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03131  02 OF 04  191134Z </p><p>11.  (C) MUGABE SAID HE WANTED DEMOCRACY FOR EVERY ZIMBABWEAN.  HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE MIGHT BE ISOLATED INCIDENTS OF LAWLESSNESS </p><p>"HERE AND THERE" AND THAT HE DISAPPROVED OF THEM.  THE PEOPLE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE WOULD BE PROSECUTED WHENEVER POSSIBLE.  IT WAS A </p><p>MISTAKE, HOWEVER, TO CHARACTERIZE ISOLATED INCIDENTS AS </p><p>GENERALIZED LAWLESSNESS.  ZIMBABWE, HE SAID, FELT UNFAIRLY TREATED </p><p>BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  ZIMBABWE\'S DIFFICULTIES WERE </p><p>RELATED TO LAND, PURE AND SIMPLE.  HE SAID HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND </p><p>WHY THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE PERSUADED TO TAKE THE SIDE OF THE </p><p>UNITED KINGDOM WITHOUT DOING ITS OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION </p><p>ON THE GROUND.  THERE WAS STILL TIME TO DO SUCH AN ASSESSMENT, HE </p><p>DECLARED.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE MIGHT BE TIMES WHEN THE GOZ </p><p>NEEDS TO "ADJUST" ITS ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) TURNING TO THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, MUGABE </p><p>SAID SOME IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ARE PUSHING TO </p><p>"SUPERVISE" IT.  THE GOZ FEELS INSULTED BY THIS, BECAUSE ZIMBABWE </p><p>HAS HELD ELECTIONS REGULARLY SINCE INDEPENDENCE.  WHY, HE ASKED, </p><p>WOULD WE SUDDENLY TURN UNDEMOCRATIC SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS AN </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY, WHEN THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSITION PARTIES </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE.  MUGABE INSISTED THAT THE GOZ HAD NEVER CHEATED IN </p><p>ITS ELECTIONS -- THERE IS NO HISTORY OF THAT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7804 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03131  03 OF 04  191135Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------31BD34  191135Z /38 </p><p>P 191101Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0074 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 003131 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 10/19/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MUGABE AND AMBASSADOR DISCUSS TERRORISM, LAND, </p><p>AND ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03131  03 OF 04  191135Z </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) THE USG IS NOT INTERESTED IN LECTURING ZIMBABWE ABOUT HOW </p><p>TO RUN ITS ELECTIONS, THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED.  HE INFORMED </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE THAT THE UNITED STATES WELCOMES OBSERVERS FOR </p><p>MOST OF OUR NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL ELECTIONS, AS DO ALMOST ALL </p><p>SADC COUNTRIES.  INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, HE CONTINUED, CAN PLAY </p><p>AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE ROLE, INCLUDING IN HELPING DISCOURAGE </p><p>VIOLENCE ON ALL SIDES.  THE WESTMINSTER FOUNDATION IN LONDON, </p><p>MUGABE RETORTED, IS GIVING FUNDS TO THE OPPOSITION MDC, WHILE THE </p><p>BRITISH GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGES OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DO THE SAME.  HOW, THEN, CAN THE </p><p>GOZ ALLOW THE BRITISH TO OBSERVE ZIMBABWE\'S ELECTION?  THE GOZ </p><p>WILL WELCOME OBSERVERS, HE SAID, BUT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE IMPARTIAL. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THAT THE U.S. NGO INTERESTED IN </p><p>OBSERVING ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION -- THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FOUNDATION FOR ELECTION SYSTEMS (IFES) -- IS NON-PARTISAN AND IS </p><p>WELL-KNOWN FOR ITS EXPERTISE IN ELECTION ADMINISTRATION.  IT </p><p>TYPICALLY HAS EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH ELECTORAL COMMISSIONS </p><p>IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND HAD RECENTLY INVITED ZIMBABWE\'S REGISTRAR- </p><p>GENERAL TO OBSERVE THE UPCOMING STATE-WIDE ELECTIONS IN VIRGINIA. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT THE GOZ WOULD BE RECEPTIVE </p><p>TO THE PARTICIPATION OF IFES IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.   IF IT WAS </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S INTENTION TO HOLD A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION </p><p>WITHOUT VIOLENCE, AND IT HAD NOTHING TO HIDE, IT COULD DEMONSTRATE </p><p>THIS IN A POWERFUL WAY BY WELCOMING THE PARTICIPATION OF GROUPS </p><p>SUCH AS IFES. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE INTERJECTED THAT ZIMBABWE HAS </p><p>ALWAYS WELCOMED INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  WHY HAS THIS BECOME SUCH </p><p>AN IMPORTANT CONCERN FOR THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION, HE ASKED?  YES, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03131  03 OF 04  191135Z </p><p>MUGABE AGREED, CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS SEEM "TOO EAGER" TO SEND </p><p>OBSERVERS THIS TIME.  WHY IS THIS ELECTION SO SPECIAL, HE </p><p>WONDERED?  THE MDC, HE SAID, WON A NUMBER OF SEATS IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS LAST YEAR, BUT ARE CHALLENGING 37 SEATS </p><p>THEY LOST ON "SMALL TECHNICALITIES."  THE OPPOSITION PARTY, HE </p><p>INSISTED, IS PURSUING THAT APPROACH PURELY AS A POLITICAL GIMMICK </p><p>TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE </p><p>JUNE 2000 ELECTIONS WERE NOT FREE AND FAIR.  WE HAVE NOTHING TO </p><p>HIDE, THE PRESIDENT ASSERTED.  WE KNOW THE "DIRTY TRICKS" THE MDC </p><p>PLAYED TO WIN AS MANY PARLIAMENTARY SEATS AS THEY DID, SUCH AS </p><p>WORKING CLANDESTINELY THROUGH NGOS AND BRIBING TRADITIONAL CHIEFS </p><p>TO ENSURE THAT THEIR SUBJECTS VOTED FOR THE OPPOSITION PARTY. </p><p>MUGABE DISMISSED THE MDC AS A PARTY IN DISARRAY. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE STRESSED THAT THE GOZ HAS NEVER </p><p>POSTPONED ELECTIONS, AND NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE MUST BE </p><p>HELD IN 2002 PRIOR TO THE END OF MARCH.  HE SAID THE RULING PARTY </p><p>WOULD WALK "CLEAR, TRANSPARENT STEPS" IN THE ELECTION SO LONG AS </p><p>THE OTHER SIDE DOES THE SAME. </p><p> </p><p>DRC </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) ON THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC), MUGABE SAID HE </p><p>WAS BAFFLED BY THE CRITICISM ZIMBABWE HAS ENDURED BECAUSE OF ITS </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THAT CONFLICT.  HE FELT STRONGLY AS THOUGH ZIMBABWE </p><p>HAD DONE THE RIGHT THING BY GOING TO THE AID OF A FELLOW SADC </p><p>GOVERNMENT UNDER THREAT.  THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT THE UNITED </p><p>STATES IS WORKING WITH ALL INVOLVED PARTIES, INCLUDING JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA\'S GOVERNMENT, TO HELP FORGE A LASTING PEACE IN THE DRC. </p><p>THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN THE RIGHT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03131  03 OF 04  191135Z </p><p>DIRECTION.  ANOTHER CRITICAL ELEMENT IN THE SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION </p><p>IS THE DISARMING AND DEMOBILIZATION OF THE EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE, AND </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR URGED THE GOZ TO COOPERATE ON THIS ISSUE AND TO </p><p>PRESS PRESIDENT KABILA TO DO THE SAME. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE CLEARLY MADE AN EFFORT TO BE FRIENDLY, </p><p>POSITIVE, SEPARATE US FROM THE BRITISH, AND OPEN CHANNELS AS HE </p><p>WOULD PUT IT "TO CORRECT THE DISTORTED VIEWS OF ZIMBABWE WHICH THE </p><p>BRITS ARE SELLING TO THE WORLD."  HIS MIND REMAINS AS SHARP AS </p><p>EVER AND HIS MEMORY UNFAILINGLY SELECTIVE.  HE IS MUCH MORE </p><p>INTERESTED WHEN HE IS TALKING HIMSELF THAN WHEN HE IS LISTENING, </p><p>BUT DID FOCUS IN WHENEVER THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO LAND OR </p><p>ELECTIONS.  HE APPEARED PHYSICALLY VIGOROUS AS WELL, PARTICULARLY </p><p>IMPRESSIVE GIVEN THAT HE HAD BEEN CONDUCTING CREDENTIALING </p><p>CEREMONIES WITHOUT A BREAK SINCE EARLY MORNING (WE COMPLETED OUR </p><p>MEETING IN MID-AFTERNOON, AND I WAS THE SEVENTH OF EIGHT </p><p>AMBASSADORS TO PRESENT CREDENTIALS THAT DAY.) </p><p> </p><p>19.
