The general consensus among reporters </p><p>is that the talks centered on Turkey\'s willingness to </p><p>cooperate with the US in a possible operation in Iraq, and </p><p>the US list of demands and offers of compensation in return. </p><p>The demands are listed as follows: Turkey should allow its </p><p>bases and ports to be used by US troops and aircrafts. </p><p>Turkey should be a logistical base and supply center in the </p><p>event of a military strike.  Turkey should be prepared to </p><p>serve as a second operational headquarters after Tampa, </p><p>Florida.  The option for allowing Turkish troops to join </p><p>British and American troops in northern Iraq should also be </p><p>considered by Turkey.  In exchange for meeting these </p><p>demands, Wolfowitz and Grossman reportedly offered a total </p><p>of 3.5 billion dollars in aid.  Some papers talk about an </p><p>additional 20 billion dollars of aid as well.  The support </p><p>will be given within a three-year period, and will also </p><p>include the forgiveness of Turkey\'s FMS debts, the </p><p>establishment of qualifying industrial zones, encouraging US </p><p>investments in Turkey, and some favors on trade quotas. </p><p>Reports also noted that the US affirmed its commitment to </p><p>prevent a separate Kurdish state in northern Iraq.  The U.S. </p><p>stance against a Kurdish state came as a relief to Turkish </p><p>officials, and made Ankara more willing to allow use of its </p><p>base facilities.  All papers report the `breaking news\' that </p><p>Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis, following his meeting with </p><p>British Foreign Minister Straw, said that Turkey will open </p><p>its airbases and facilities for the US in the event of a </p><p>military operation.  However, mass appeal "Hurriyet" fronts </p><p>a flashy story that referred to the issue as a `base </p><p>crisis.\'  According to "Hurriyet," Yakis\' announcement </p><p>caused serious concerns among military officials and Foreign </p><p>Ministry bureaucrats.  Deputy Chief of General Staff Gen. </p><p>Buyukanit told "Hurriyet" that permission for use of the </p><p>airbases requires a political decision, and that the </p><p>military is not aware that such a decision has been taken. </p><p>General Buyukanit said that the FM\'s statement `might be his </p><p>personal opinion.\'  In a press release issued after </p><p>midnight, the MFA clarified the Foreign Minister\'s remarks, </p><p>saying that `Turkey has not committed itself.  Minister </p><p>Yakis was talking about possible options in the spirit of </p><p>good, friendly relations with the US.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reports also note that both Wolfowitz and Grossman </p><p>reiterated strong US support for Turkey\'s EU accession, and </p><p>underlined the importance of settling the Cyprus issue as </p><p>soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan to Washington:  All papers report that AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan received an official invitation from the White </p><p>House.  The date of Erdogan\'s meeting with President Bush </p><p>has been set for December 10. The invitation was extended to </p><p>Erdogan during the dinner at the American Embassy residence </p><p>in honor of Wolfowitz and Grossman.  Erdogan changed his </p><p>travel plans immediately, and decided to go to Denmark </p><p>before the EU summit and fly to Washington from there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU Reforms: The AKP government has prepared a series of </p><p>legal reforms and sent the reform package to Parliament for </p><p>final consideration.  The package would make closure of </p><p>political parties more difficult, bring tougher measures to </p><p>prevent torture, and ease the restrictions on minority </p><p>foundations wishing to acquire property.  The changes will </p><p>also pave the way for Erdogan to become eligible to run for </p><p>parliament. </p><p></p></div>
