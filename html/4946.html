<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000016 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP (LMALENAS), NEA/P (ACASPER), NEA/PPD </p><p>(JDAVIES, WMOONEY, CBOURGEOIS), INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  A YEAR\'S REFLECTIONS ON MEPI, IRAQ, </p><p>AND DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  UAE MEDIA COMMENTED ON WHAT IT CALLED PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH\'S POSITIVE STATEMENT ON IRAQ.  HOWEVER, LOCAL MEDIA ALSO </p><p>LABELED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENTS ON IRAQ AND NORTH KOREA AS </p><p>CONTRADICTORY.  AN "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIAL HOPED PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH\'S STATEMENTS REPRESENT A NEW AMERICAN START TO REMOVE THE </p><p>SPECTER OF WAR HOVERING IN THE REGION.  MEANWHILE, "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>ARGUED CONTRADICTORY POSITIONS AND VAGUE QUESTIONS REFLECT A U.S. </p><p>POLICY LACKING BALANCE AND REASON.  RESPONDING TO THE THREAT OF </p><p>WAR, "AL BAYAN" CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONFRONT </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S NEW POLICY OF DOMINATION.  CONSIDERING SUCH A </p><p>SCENARIO UNLIKELY, CHIEF EDITOR OF "AL BAYAN" DELIBERATED ON </p><p>WHETHER OR NOT SADDAM WOULD SURPRISE EVERYONE BY CHOOSING SELF- </p><p>EXILE.  DEMOCRACY WAS ALSO A FOCUS OF SOME DAILIES, WHO REPORTED </p><p>NO ACHIEVEMENTS TOWARDS DEMOCRACY IN THE ARAB WORLD DURING 2002. </p><p>REFLECTING ON 2002, AN "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIAL NOTED THERE </p><p>WERE NO SERIOUS EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRACY OR DEVELOP CIVIC </p><p>INSTITUTIONS IN THE ARAB WORLD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  REVIEWING THE EVENTS OF 2002, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB </p><p>"AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/1: </p><p> </p><p>"...DURING 2002, WE DID NOT SEE SERIOUS ARAB EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND BUILD INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY, EXCEPT IN ONE </p><p>OR TWO PLACES IN THE ENTIRE ARAB WORLD.  POLITICAL TRANQUILITY IS </p><p>DOMINANT, THUS, OPENING THE DOOR FOR EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE, THE </p><p>MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH IS SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL\'S </p><p>INITIATIVE FOR DEMOCRACY IN THE ARAB WORLD..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S POSITIVE STATEMENTS ON IRAQ, </p><p>"AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/4: </p><p> </p><p>"... WE HOPE PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENTS ARE A START OF AMERICAN </p><p>STEPS TO REMOVE THE SPECTER OF WAR FROM THE REGION.  THE </p><p>STATEMENTS MUST BE COMBINED WITH PRACTICAL STEPS ON THE GROUND BY </p><p>DISCONTINUING THE FEVER OF THE CONTINUOUS MILITARY BUILD-UP (IN </p><p>THE GULF) THAT TAKES PLACE DAY AND NIGHT..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMPARING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DON RUMSFELD\'S TONE TOWARDS </p><p>IRAQ IN 1983 AND AT PRESENT, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 1/1: </p><p> </p><p>"... RUMSFELD IS PUSHING FOR A DESTRUCTIVE WAR AGAINST THE IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE, PRETENDING TO REMOVE WMD, (WHILE AT THE SAME TIME) THE </p><p>SAME PERSON WHO FACILITATED PROVIDING BAGHDAD WITH DOUBLE-USE </p><p>WEAPONS WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ... THE QUESTION TO BE ASKED IS </p><p>WHAT KIND OF DOUBLE STANDARD IS CONTROLLING THE POLICY OF SUCH A </p><p>LARGE COUNTRY CLAIMING - IN A FAKE MANNER - TO BE COMMITTED TO </p><p>SECURITY, STABILITY, LEGITIMACY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS? ... RUMSFELD\'S </p><p>SCANDAL UNCOVERED (IN A RECENT ARTICLE) BY THE \'WASHINGTON POST\' </p><p>ON HELPING BAGHDAD ACQUIRE WEAPONS DURING THE 1980\'S IS NEITHER </p><p>THE FIRST NOR THE LAST ONE.  HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD BE A NEW LESSON </p><p>FOR ARAB COUNTRIES NOT TO TRUST THE U.S. OR ITS PROMISES, </p><p>FRIENDSHIP, OR ALLIANCE, ESPECIALLY IF THIS ALLIANCE IS AGAINST </p><p>AN ARAB COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON WHAT IT CALLED CONTRADICTIONS IN PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH\'S POSITION TOWARDS IRAQ AND NORTH KOREA, "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 1/2: </p><p> </p><p>"... AFTER PRESIDENT BUSH ADMITS SADDAM HUSSEIN DOES NOT POSSESS </p><p>WMD, HE MENTIONS THE POSSIBILITY OF SADDAM ATTACKING THE U.S. AND </p><p>DAMAGING ITS ECONOMY PERSONALLY OR THROUGH AN AGENT.  HOW CAN THE </p><p>IRAQI PRESIDENT ATTACK THE U.S., WITH WHAT KIND OF WEAPON, AND </p><p>WHO IS THIS AGENT?  NEVERTHELESS, AS FAR AS NORTH KOREA IS </p><p>CONCERNED, BUSH EMPHASIZES IT POSSESSES TWO NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT </p><p>LEAST BUT STILL BELIEVES THE SITUATION CAN BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY </p><p>THROUGH DIPLOMATIC MEANS.  THE QUESTION IS WHY CAN THE NORTH </p><p>KOREAN CASE BE SOLVED PEACEFULLY BUT NOT THE IRAQI? ... </p><p>CONTRADICTING STANCES AND VAGUE QUESTIONS REFLECT A U.S. POLICY </p><p>LACKING BALANCE AND REASON." </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "DOMINATION IS REJECTED", DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/4: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. PRESIDENT TRIES TO APPLY NEW RULES IN AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL POLICY GIVING WASHINGTON THE RIGHT TO CHANGE </p><p>REGIMES THAT DO NOT MOVE IN ITS ORBIT, AND REPLACE THEM WITH MORE </p><p>COOPERATIVE ONES.  THE TERM OF COOPERATION IN THE AMERICAN </p><p>CONCEPT IS TO BE ON THE LIST OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE ORDERS AND </p><p>EXECUTE THEM WITHOUT HESITATION.  THUS, THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY MUST CONFRONT THIS NEW POLICY..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENTING ON TERRORISM BETWEEN 2002 AND 2003, COLUMNIST </p><p>AHMED AL KANANI ARGUED IN "AL BAYAN" ON 1/3 THAT ARABS AND </p><p>AMERICAN HAVE EACH ACCUSED THE OTHER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR 9/11: </p><p> </p><p>"... IF ARABS AND AMERICANS CHANGE THEIR ROLES, EACH SIDE WILL </p><p>SEE THE REALITY OF THE PROBLEM AND DISCOVER THE REASONS BEHIND </p><p>IT.  THE TWO SIDES ARE BOTH RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED.  THE </p><p>U.S. DISREGARD FOR ARAB RIGHTS AND BIAS TO ISRAEL GENERATE ANGER </p><p>AND HATRED AMONG ARABS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, ARABS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, FAIL TO PROMOTE TOLERANCE BASED ON FREEDOM, </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE, AND PROTECTION FROM - </p><p>GOVERNMENT-DESIRED - SUBJUGATION TO WASHINGTON ... ARAB </p><p>OFFICIALS\' ADAPTATION TO THE AMERICAN RULES OF THE WAR ON SO- </p><p>CALLED TERRORISM CONTROL OF THE FUTURE OF THE ARAB WORLD ... THIS </p><p>WAR CARRIES AN ABSENCE OF SOVEREIGNTY, EXECUTION WITHOUT TRIAL, </p><p>AND WILL MAKE ARAB BLOOD PUBLIC.  WHAT HAPPENED IN YEMEN IS THE </p><p>BEST EVIDENCE OF THIS.  IT MEANS THE INCREASE OF (U.S.) STATE </p><p>TERRORISM CONFRONTING INDIVIDUAL TERRORISM I.E. TERRORISM AND </p><p>COUNTER TERRORISM..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  REVIEWING 2002 AND COMMENTING ON THE US DEPARTMENT OF STATE </p><p>SPOKESMAN\'S SUPPORT FOR SADDAM\'S SELF-EXILE, "AL BAYAN" EDITOR-IN- </p><p>CHIEF KHALED MOHAMMED AHMED WROTE IN 1/4: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE NEW YEAR UNDOUBTEDLY CARRIES SURPRISES.  NEWS ON SADDAM </p><p>LEAVING IRAQ FOR ANOTHER COUNTRY HAS INCREASED RECENTLY.  DESPITE </p><p>NEWS ON THE \'EXILE,\' IS THERE GOING TO BE A \'SURPRISE?\'  LET\'S </p><p>WAIT AND SEE." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
