<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001069 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WIN DAYTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: MNANGAGWA SPEAKS ON SUCCESSION, PARTY TALKS, AND </p><p>MASS ACTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 HARARE 2127 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER KIMBERLY C. JEMISON FOR REASONS 1.5 C/ </p><p>D. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY. 1. At a meeting on May 28, 2003 Speaker of </p><p>Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa preferred to review Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>history rather than offering much insight into party </p><p>succession activities, reopening a dialogue between ZANU-PF </p><p>and MDC leadership, and likely ZANU-PF reactions to the </p><p>impending mass action. He did, however, suggest that party </p><p>talks might resume if attention could be shifted from </p><p>recognizing President Robert Mugabe as the head of state to </p><p>addressing the flawed electoral process and the conclusion of </p><p>the second land audit as a minimum condition for Mugabe to </p><p>step down.  Mnangagwa also stated that GOZ would react </p><p>peacefully to MDC demonstrations.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>LAND STILL AN ISSUE </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador, visiting AF/S Director Scott DeLisi, </p><p>and PolOff met with Speaker of the Parliament Emmerson </p><p>Mnangagwa on May 28, 2003.  Mnangagwa spent well over half of </p><p>the meeting reciting the history of Zimbabwe and extolling </p><p>the necessity and success of the land reform program, </p><p>proclaiming that, because of land redistribution, the future </p><p>was bright for Zimbabwe.  He did admit, as he had in an </p><p>earlier meeting (See Reftel), there were some allocation </p><p>problems but then maligned the first land audit saying the </p><p>same people who were guilty of taking multiple farms </p><p>researched and wrote it.  (COMMENT: Flora Buka, Minister of </p><p>State for Land Reform Program, supervised the first land </p><p>audit, which was leaked to the international press.  Much of </p><p>her information came from the Commercial Farmers Union. </p><p>Since the report, Buka has been shut out of the party inner </p><p>circle. END COMMENT.) He claimed that the current </p><p>"independent" audit would be a more accurate portrayal of the </p><p>problem and should be completed in July. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>LIMITED POSSIBILITY OF RESUMING INTER-PARTY DIALOGUE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>3. (U) When asked about resuming the dialogue between MDC and </p><p>ZANU-PF, Mnangagwa claimed that ZANU-PF was ready to talk at </p><p>all levels but presidential.  Talks at that level, however, </p><p>would be contingent upon Morgan Tsvangirai recognizing Robert </p><p>Mugabe as President.  Mnangagwa told us soon after the </p><p>presidential elections in March 2002, the Nigerians and South </p><p>Africans told him that MDC Secretary General Welshman Ncube </p><p>had said the MDC took issue with the process of the election, </p><p>maintaining that the process was flawed and should have been </p><p>brought before the Electoral Supervisory Commission. </p><p>Mnangagwa said that Ncube never relayed this information to </p><p>him or ZANU-PF and that such an overture might help reopen </p><p>the lines of communication. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>AGREES ON PRINCIPLE OF PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>4. (U) Regarding the mass action, Mnangagwa dismissed the war </p><p>veterans, threats to break up any opposition-led </p><p>demonstrations, characterizing it as a campaign tactic by </p><p>Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans\' Association head, </p><p>Patrick Nyaruwata.  Mnangagwa maintained that it was better </p><p>to have peaceful demonstrations now than for the people to </p><p>have pent up frustrations, which could manifest in more </p><p>violent ways. He agreed with the U.S. stance that </p><p>demonstrations should be non-violent and that GOZ authorities </p><p>should react peacefully. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>LAND IS KEY TO SUCCESSION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) When asked whether he would elaborate on the </p><p>succession issue beyond what has been reported in the press, </p><p>Mnangagwa maintained that he had told the truth in the press </p><p>and there was nothing more to add.  The Ambassador\'s </p><p>subsequent attempts to elicit more information were not </p><p>successful.  Mnangagwa would only say that the party could </p><p>not have a new president until the land business was </p><p>finished, thereby securing Mugabe\'s legacy as the champion of </p><p>land reform.  He claimed the second land audit was the final </p><p>step. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>6.  (C) Mnangagwa\'s comments regarding the MDC/ZANU-PF talks </p><p>suggest there may be a way to resume talks if the focus of </p><p>contention moves from recognizing Mugabe as President to </p><p>addressing the flawed electoral process.  At a cocktail </p><p>reception on May 28, Paul Themba Nyathi, MDC MP for Gwanda </p><p>North and party spokesman, stated that the party\'s early </p><p>refusal to accept Mugabe as President was ill-conceived and </p><p>has made it more difficult to facilitate talks between the </p><p>two parties. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Mnangagwa\'s two statements that ZANU-PF could only </p><p>elect a new president after the land reform has been </p><p>completed and that the second land audit is the final step, </p><p>combined with Mugabe\'s recent calls for an open dialogue on </p><p>succession suggest the "Old Man" may be willing to step down. </p><p> In a meeting with PolOff, Victor Chitongo, ZANU-PF MP for </p><p>Murewa North who claims to speak with Politburo members </p><p>regularly, also confirmed behind the scenes jockeying for </p><p>leadership and the desire for Mugabe to conclude the land </p><p>redistribution before he seriously considers stepping down. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
