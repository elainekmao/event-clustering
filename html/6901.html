(U) To our knowledge, no new SARS cases were reported on </p><p>March 28 (but Mission was unable to get a hold of WHO in Hanoi by </p><p>COB today to verify this information).  The French Hospital </p><p>discharged another four persons on the evening of March 27 for a </p><p>total of 13 cases discharged since the beginning of the outbreak. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Australian Embassy reports that it is providing </p><p>prospective travelers to Vietnam with information from the World </p><p>Health Organization\'s website and is advising that Australians </p><p>concerned at the risks presented by SARS in certain countries </p><p>should reconsider their need to travel.  Denmark and the United </p><p>Kingdom also are providing information based on the WHO website. </p><p>The Canadian Embassy provides SARS information from its Health </p><p>Canada website.  The French Embassy is sending out warden </p><p>messages almost everyday and is also posting information on its </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.  The Czech Republic\'s </p><p>Embassy is advising Czech citizens to defer all non-essential </p><p>travel to Vietnam and is cautioning about secondary effects due </p><p>to the reduction of available medical facilities in Hanoi. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In our message to non-official American citizen wardens </p><p>on March 17, Mission advised that American citizens should avoid </p><p>visiting hospitals or clinics.  We no longer believe this </p><p>precaution is necessary.  Clinics have instituted careful </p><p>screening procedures to separate any potential SARS cases from </p><p>the general population in waiting rooms.  In addition, barring a </p><p>new introduction of SARS from outside of Vietnam, it appears that </p><p>SARS continues to be confined to the health care community in </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
