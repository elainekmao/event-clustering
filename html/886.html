<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L LIMA 004928 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:6/5/07 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PMIL, PE </p><p>SUBJECT: SENDERO LUMINOSO LEADER "FELICIANO" CORNERED -- YET AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY JAMES F. MACK, DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION, </p><p>AMERICAN EMBASSY, LIMA.  REASON 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  A PERUVIAN MILITARY OFFICER IN THE AYACUCHO </p><p>REGION RECENTLY TOLD US THAT HIS UNIT BELIEVES OSCAR RAMIREZ DURAN </p><p>(A.K.A. "FELICIANO"), THE MOST IMPORTANT SENDERO LUMINOSO (SHINING </p><p>PATH - SL) LEADER OUTSIDE OF JAIL, IS STILL CORNERED WITH THIRTY TO </p><p>FIFTY CADRES IN A BROKEN, WOODED REGION NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF </p><p>THE MONTARO AND APURIMAC RIVERS.  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT </p><p>PERUVIAN OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR BELIEF THAT THE SL LEADER </p><p>WAS TRAPPED  -- SOMEHOW IN THE PAST HE HAS ALWAYS MANAGED TO </p><p>ESCAPE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COLONEL DARWIN RENGIFO RIOS, SECOND IN COMMAND AT THE </p><p>AYACUCHO MILITARY BASE, TOLD US JUNE 4 THAT THE PERUVIAN MILITARY </p><p>HAD SUCCEEDED IN CORNERING SENDERO LUMINOSO (SL) LEADER "FELICIANO" </p><p>WITH THIRTY TO FIFTY SHINING PATH CADRES IN THE TRIANGULAR REGION </p><p>SOUTHWEST OF THE INTERSECTION OF THE APURIMAC AND MONTARO RIVERS. </p><p>THE ROUGHLY 900 SQUARE KILOMETER AREA IS HEAVILY WOODED, LIGHLY </p><p>POPULATED AND CHARACTERIZED BY EXTREMELY BROKEN TERRAIN.  THERE IS </p><p>NO COCA CULTIVATION IN THE REGION; AS A RESULT, THE ARMY BELIEVES </p><p>"FELICIANO\'S" GROUP IS UNABLE TO LIVE OFF WAR TAXES.  RENGIFO </p><p>STATED THAT THE PERUVIAN MILITARY HAD LAUNCHED A NUMBER OF </p><p>OPERATIONS INTO THE AREA IN RECENT MONTHS BUT HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN </p><p>CAPTURING THE SL LEADER.  MILITARY FORCES RAIDED "FELICIANO\'S" CAMP </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS VACATED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND ONCE EVEN </p><p>CAPTURED THE SL LEADER\'S BED.  THE MILITARY ALSO DESTROYED OVER TEN </p><p>SEPARATE FARMING SITES, WHERE SHINING PATH HAD SOWN YUCA AND OTHER </p><p>CROPS AS FOODSTUFFS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE COLONEL ASSERTED THAT AFTER YEARS OF SL ATROCITIES, </p><p>VILLAGERS THROUGHOUT THE REGION ARE FIRMLY ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>SIDE AGAINST THE TERRORIST GROUP.  HE OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE NOW </p><p>OVER 120,000 RONDEROS (VILLAGE CIVIL DEFENSE MEMBERS) WITH OVER </p><p>6,000 WEAPONS IN THE AYACUCHO MILITARY DISTRICT.  IF "FELICIANO" </p><p>AND THE SENDERO CADRES ATTEMPT TO FLEE THEIR CURRENT HIDEOUT, THEY </p><p>WILL BE QUICKLY SPOTTED IN THE TREELESS TERRAIN WHICH SURROUNDS THE </p><p>AREA, RENGIFO CLAIMED.  HE ALSO SAID "FELICIANO" CANNOT HIDE OUT IN </p><p>ANY OF THE VILLAGES IN THE REGION BECAUSE THE RONDEROS WOULD </p><p>QUICKLY REPORT HIS PRESENCE.  THE MILITARY IS REPOPULATING VILLAGES </p><p>WHICH HAD BEEN ABANDONED EARLIER DURING THE HEIGHT OF TERRORIST </p><p>VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO FURTHER REDUCE "FELICIANO\'S" FREEDOM OF </p><p>ACTION.  IN MID-JUNE, THERE ARE PLANS TO REPOPULATE TIRCOS, A </p><p>VILLAGE DUE WEST OF SAN FRANCISCO IN HUANTA PROVINCE, RENGIFO SAID. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  "FELICIANO" AND HIS GROUP FACE A DISMAL FUTURE, WITH FOOD </p><p>RUNNING OUT AND NOWHERE TO OBTAIN SUPPLIES, ACCORDING TO RENGIFO. </p><p>HE EXPRESSED HIS BELIEF THAT THE GROUP WILL EITHER (1) MAKE A BREAK </p><p>FOR IT AND EXPOSE ITSELF TO MILITARY ACTION, (2) BREAK UP AND </p><p>DISPERSE, OR (3) SUFFER A VIOLENT INTERNAL CONFRONTATION IN WHICH </p><p>SOME SL MEMBERS ARE KILLED.  "I CAN\'T SAY THAT WE WILL CAPTURE </p><p>\'FELICIANO\' TOMORROW, IN THE NEXT WEEK OR EVEN IN THE NEXT YEAR," </p><p>HE SAID, "BUT TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR SENDERO LUMINOSO HERE." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  COMMENT:  PERUVIAN MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR </p><p>BELIEF THAT SL LEADER "FELICIANO" HAS BEEN CORNERED MANY TIMES IN </p><p>RECENT YEARS.  WE CANNOT CONFIRM, HOWEVER, THAT "FELICIANO" IS IN </p><p>FACT IN THE TRIANGULAR REGION DESCRIBED BY REGIFO; LOCAL MEDIA </p><p>REPORTS HAVE PLACED HIM IN CUSCO, LIMA, THE UPPER HUALLAGA VALLEY </p><p>AND OTHER LOCATIONS IN RECENT MONTHS.  DESPITE FREQUENT REPORTS OF </p><p>HIS IMMINENT ARREST, "FELICIANO" HAS SO FAR ESCAPED THE ARMY\'S NET. </p><p> </p><p>JETT </p><p></p></div>
