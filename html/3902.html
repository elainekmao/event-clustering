<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001858 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10-07-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PINR, PHUM, CE, Political Parties, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  To ease cohabitation tensions, president and </p><p>PM Wickremesinghe agree to "joint" meetings </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1848, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  The Ambassador met Minister Milinda </p><p>Moragoda and Norwegian Ambassador Westborg on October 5. </p><p>In a wide-ranging discussion, Moragoda reviewed his </p><p>recent meeting with President Kumaratunga, and said the </p><p>two sides had agreed to hold regular high-level </p><p>discussions on peace process and national security </p><p>issues.  Re dealings with the Tamil Tigers, Westborg </p><p>commented that the GSL was probably wise to focus on </p><p>small, meliorative steps and not structural "big </p><p>picture" matters that could prove controversial at this </p><p>stage.  While the news re "joint" meetings was positive, </p><p>it is hard to be optimistic about this latest effort to </p><p>bridge the cohabitation divide.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Moragoda reviews meeting with Kumaratunga </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador, DCM, and polchief met October 5 </p><p>with Milinda Moragoda, a minister and key player for the </p><p>GSL on peace process issues, and Norwegian Ambassador </p><p>Jon Westborg.  Moragoda, when he was not on his cell </p><p>phone with the prime minister, reviewed his October 4 </p><p>meeting with President Kumaratunga and former Foreign </p><p>Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a key adviser.  Much of </p><p>the two-and-a-half hour meeting with the president was </p><p>taken up with what Moragoda called "a history lesson," </p><p>as Kumaratunga reviewed how cohabitation ties had </p><p>reached their currently parlous state.  Moragoda </p><p>stressed that he had tried hard to understand </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s litany of complaints, but admitted he had </p><p>difficulty making sense of it all. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) (((Note:  Moragoda said Kumaratunga had repeated </p><p>her long-standing complaint that her son had not been </p><p>admitted to a well-known local high school some 15 years </p><p>ago when PM Wickremesinghe was Education Minister.  In </p><p>doing this, she apparently did not repeat her </p><p>controversial public charge last week that </p><p>Wickremesinghe and his staff had demanded a bribe in </p><p>exchange for support for her son\'s application -- see </p><p>Reftel.  Also see Westborg\'s comments below re another </p><p>of the president\'s complaints, e.g., that the GSL should </p><p>allow her to have a representative on its peace </p><p>negotiation team.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Two Sides agree to "Joint" meetings </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Despite the complaints from Kumaratunga, </p><p>Moragoda indicated that the meeting turned out to be </p><p>productive.  After obtaining the prime minister\'s </p><p>approval, Moragoda related that he had proposed that the </p><p>two sides hold regular "joint" meetings to discuss peace </p><p>process and national security issues.  The president had </p><p>accepted the offer.  Reviewing the proposal with </p><p>Ambassador Wills, Moragoda related that he would join </p><p>with the PM and Defense Minister Marapana to form the </p><p>GSL team, while the president would be accompanied by </p><p>Kadirgamar and one other (as yet unnamed) adviser.  It </p><p>was not clear how often the meetings would be held, but </p><p>Moragoda indicated that he was thinking they would take </p><p>place every couple of weeks, and before and after the </p><p>upcoming rounds of talks with the Tamil Tigers. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ambassador Wills commented that the idea of </p><p>holding the joint meetings was a positive development, </p><p>which perhaps would lead to a long-term cooling down in </p><p>tensions between the two sides.  In response, Moragoda </p><p>said he sincerely hoped that it worked.  There were </p><p>still outstanding tensions on other issues, however.  He </p><p>noted that the GSL continued to pursue parliamentary </p><p>agreement on a proposed constitutional amendment that </p><p>would rein in the president\'s powers to call new </p><p>elections and allow crossover voting.  Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>Supreme Court was examining various petitions related to </p><p>the government\'s proposed bill at this time.  Depending </p><p>on how the Supreme Court handles the many petitions, </p><p>including one that demands a popular referendum on the </p><p>amendment, an up-or-down vote might take place in </p><p>Parliament sometime in the next several weeks.  It was </p><p>still up in the air whether the government had the two- </p><p>thirds support necessary to win the vote, according to </p><p>Moragoda.  The GSL had the support of the Tamil parties, </p><p>but it was not yet clear whether enough members of the </p><p>president\'s People\'s Alliance party intended to defect. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Dealing with the Tigers </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Switching focus, the conversation turned to the </p><p>status of the peace process.  Moragoda noted that the </p><p>GSL was working hard to gain the release of six Sri </p><p>Lankan soldiers held by the Tamil Tigers in Trincomalee </p><p>District.  (Note:  The Tigers released one of the </p><p>soldiers last week.  The other six soldiers have been </p><p>detained since September 25 -- see Reftels.)  The Tigers </p><p>were driving a hard bargain, demanding the release of </p><p>two of their cadre held by the GSL.  The government </p><p>hoped to resolve the issue and was putting pressure on </p><p>the judiciary to give bail to the two LTTE cadre.  In </p><p>any case, tensions in the east were hot over the issue </p><p>and many roads in Trincomalee had been closed down by a </p><p>strike on October 4.  In other parts of the east, </p><p>Muslims were upset over Tiger activities, as well as </p><p>other issues. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  Moragoda noted that he planned to </p><p>visit Trincomalee on October 6 to check on the problems </p><p>there.  In an October 7 meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>General Balagalle, the Army chief, said he had </p><p>accompanied Moragoda on his trip to Trincomalee.  He </p><p>said Moragoda had faced harsh questions about the </p><p>soldiers\' situation from many Sinhalese.  Moragoda had </p><p>handled himself well, the general remarked, but there </p><p>was a lot of tension in the air.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Ambassador Wills asked Westborg about Tiger </p><p>spokesman Anton Balasingham\'s recent comments made after </p><p>the mid-September talks in Thailand that seemed to edge </p><p>away from separatism.  Westborg replied that Balasingham </p><p>and the Tigers now seemed to support the idea of </p><p>achieving regional autonomy (as opposed to outright </p><p>independence) via negotiations.  In any case, the </p><p>government seems to be making a wise choice in not </p><p>pressing the Tigers for agreement on wide-ranging </p><p>constitutional issues at this time, Westborg remarked. </p><p>These issues made the Tigers uncomfortable and would </p><p>force them to define their terms, which was something </p><p>the group did not want to do at this stage in the </p><p>negotiations.  In its past discussions with the Tigers </p><p>over the course of many years, the government had always </p><p>pressed the group on complex "big picture" </p><p>constitutional proposals re regional devolution and the </p><p>like.  The Tigers had been scarred away.  Better for the </p><p>GSL to proceed as it is by gaining agreement first on </p><p>smaller, practical issues, such as the lifting of </p><p>restrictions on travel and other confidence-building </p><p>measures. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The Ambassador also asked Westborg about the </p><p>president\'s request to attach a representative to the </p><p>government\'s peace negotiation team.  Westborg said this </p><p>idea would only work out if both the president and the </p><p>PM made the choice of who the representative would be. </p><p>There was no way the Tigers would accept working with a </p><p>person who was identified as the president\'s </p><p>representative alone.  The group did not trust her. </p><p>They felt that she was surrounded by Sinhalese </p><p>extremists, and it was an unfortunate fact of the peace </p><p>process that the Tigers often acted emotionally and </p><p>irrationally to any hint of Sinhalese chauvinism </p><p>emanating from the south. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) (((Note:  Although Westborg did not explicitly </p><p>mention it, it is well-known that the Tigers will not </p><p>sit down in any room with former Foreign Minister </p><p>Kadirgamar, who is otherwise a logical choice for any </p><p>presidential appointment to the negotiating team.  As </p><p>Kadirgamar is Tamil, the Tigers consider him to be a </p><p>traitor to their cause.  Westborg did note that </p><p>Kadirgamar, beyond his sometimes hard-edged stance re </p><p>the peace process, had revealed himself to be deeply </p><p>committed to the plight of Tamils, feeling that the </p><p>community had indeed suffered severe persecution at the </p><p>hands of the Sinhalese.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The news that the two sides have agreed to </p><p>"joint" meetings is constructive.  That said, it is hard </p><p>to be optimistic about this latest effort to bridge the </p><p>cohabitation divide.  Our assessment is that the </p><p>tensions between the two sides are so endemic and so </p><p>personalized at this point that we do not see them going </p><p>away anytime soon.  The ongoing debate over the proposed </p><p>bill limiting her powers could prove the catalyst for </p><p>renewed cohabitation combat, for example. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Moragoda deserves praise for winning the </p><p>president\'s agreement to the proposal involving regular </p><p>meetings with the PM.  He really seems to understand the </p><p>need to cool down tensions to the extent possible for </p><p>the sake of the peace process.  (Note:  He also seems a </p><p>good choice as interlocutor with Kumaratunga.  In one of </p><p>those rare asides in which you briefly glimpse the </p><p>"real" Sri Lanka, Moragoda told the Ambassador that he </p><p>shared a caste background with Kumaratunga, a fact which </p><p>she had told him was important to her.  Both his </p><p>grandfather and Kumaratunga\'s slain husband were members </p><p>of the "Durawe," a caste traditionally involved in </p><p>"toddy tapping," the first step in brewing a popular </p><p>alcoholic beverage called arrack.  Such is the stuff of </p><p>better cohabitation ties!) </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) With respect to the peace process, Westborg\'s </p><p>comments that the government should continue its current </p><p>focus on small, meliorative steps were perceptive.  The </p><p>Tigers seem to be reacting well to the government\'s </p><p>current policy of moving toward what we call a "sloppy </p><p>solution" in which the two sides build up trust over a </p><p>long period through an established pattern of </p><p>confidence-building measures.  As Westborg has noted, </p><p>past peace processes have been literally blown apart by </p><p>GSL efforts to get the Tiger\'s to agree first (and on </p><p>the dotted line) to "big picture" structural issues, </p><p>such as what the north and east might look like down the </p><p>road following a peace accord.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
