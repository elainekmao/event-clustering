<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HO CHI MINH CITY 000251 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREF, MOPS, SOCI, PGOV, PREL, KIRF, VM, HUMANR, ETMIN, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: MENNONITES TURN UP THE VOLUME ON COMPLAINTS OF </p><p>PERSECUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HCMC 0111 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  In a flurry of conversations with ConGenoffs over the </p><p>past week, a Mennonite church leader and several of his colleagues </p><p>have lodged serious complaints of stepped-up religious repression </p><p>by government officials.  The allegations include arrests, </p><p>beatings, destruction of property, and six cases of poisoning. </p><p>The pastors also asked for assistance in following up on three </p><p>possible POW/MIA cases.  Post is endeavoring to verify the more </p><p>specific allegations, but finds some of them initially more </p><p>credible than others.  However, this pastor has accurately </p><p>reported on specific incidents of GVN harassment in the past.  The </p><p>Mennonites currently claim ten pastors serving 10,000 believers </p><p>nationwide. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Increased Surveillance in HCMC </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Last week, Post\'s primary contact on Mennonite issues </p><p>initiated a rather hurried conversation with an FSN he had met in </p><p>the past.  When they met in a coffee shop the next day, he </p><p>explained that his activities were being closely monitored and he </p><p>didn\'t feel comfortable mentioning any foreign names.  In addition </p><p>to the claims of around-the-clock surveillance, he believed that </p><p>local gangs were cooperating with the police to intimidate him. </p><p>As proof, he pointed to four vehicular accidents in the past two </p><p>weeks, including one incident where the other driver had yelled: </p><p>"Go to hell.  You\'re dead."  Two local police had recently visited </p><p>him at home to tell him that he was being closely watched.  The </p><p>officers left with sinister threats to return in force, once their </p><p>superiors had given them the green light. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Border Guard Turned Pastor </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  A day after this secretive meeting with FSN, the same </p><p>pastor and a colleague apparently felt comfortable enough to meet </p><p>with Poloff at the Consulate General.  He had visited the ConGen </p><p>just a few weeks earlier with several other pastors as well </p><p>(reftel).  This time, he brought along a Mennonite leader from the </p><p>Central Highlands.  This other pastor had been a member of the </p><p>border police until losing his job for sympathizing with </p><p>Christians in 1989.  (His former boss, a Colonel, lost his job in </p><p>1990 for the same reason.)  Since 2000, he had been working </p><p>closely within the Mennonite movement in Dak Lak, Kon Tum, and Gia </p><p>Lai.  He claimed that the provincial authorities had encouraged </p><p>him to register his churches, only to reject the applications </p><p>without explanation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The Central Highlands pastor had been detained and </p><p>beaten several times over the last 13 years for his religious </p><p>activities.  (He casually remarked that police had beaten him </p><p>about the face two days earlier, although ConGenoffs did not </p><p>observe any marks or bruises, or difficulty in speaking.) </p><p>Moreover, the government had repeatedly refused his applications </p><p>for a residency permit and ID.  (Both pastors asked the ConGen to </p><p>confront provincial authorities on this issue.)  Pressure on his </p><p>Mennonite congregations had forced them to disperse, something he </p><p>was trying to reverse.  In February of this year, police had </p><p>disrupted a service at his home and confiscated religious articles </p><p>and several motorcycles.  (He intimated that the motorcycles may </p><p>have been improperly registered.)  The worshippers were able to </p><p>convince the police not to arrest him, but he was forced to move. </p><p>The house where he now lived with his relatives was under </p><p>extremely close surveillance.  Local officials had threatened to </p><p>prevent the children of those relatives from sitting for the </p><p>national university entrance examination as long as he remained in </p><p>their home. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Repression in the Central Highlands </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The two pastors elaborated on a host of charges over </p><p>the past week, including claims that government officials </p><p>continued to beat and threaten Protestant Banar, Ede, and Gia Rai </p><p>ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands in an effort to </p><p>suppress their religious beliefs.  They accused the GVN of sending </p><p>in military forces to reinforce local police units in enforcing </p><p>restrictions, and pointed to an organized campaign to promote the </p><p>restoration of traditional, ritualistic (i.e., not Christian) </p><p>practices.  While they were short on specifics, and many of the </p><p>abuses cited occurred as long as two years ago, they did offer to </p><p>provide proof.  Unfortunately, their offers to provide evidence in </p><p>the past have sometimes failed to materialize. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  In one particular case, the pastors asked ConGen to </p><p>intercede on behalf of over 450 Hmong ethnic minority families who </p><p>had moved from Son La in the North to Dak Lak over the past year </p><p>to escape arrest and persecution for their religious beliefs.  The </p><p>new migrants had reportedly asked the pastors if they should </p><p>resort to using violent means, behavior that the pastors claimed </p><p>to have discouraged as unchristian.  The pastors were proud to say </p><p>that, while the GVN was convinced of their involvement in some of </p><p>the ethnic violence that has plagued the Central Highlands over </p><p>the past two years, they had never pursued such methods.  When </p><p>asked if the congregations were apolitical or non-FULRO, however, </p><p>they were quick to add that while they had never sought out former </p><p>FULRO members for their church, they had never discriminated </p><p>against them either.  In fact, they proudly claimed to have </p><p>trained "both former FULRO members and CPV cadres to become </p><p>leaders of Mennonite congregations." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>A New Province is Heard From </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The pastors made quite specific claims of GVN </p><p>mistreatment of 700 Xtieng ethnic minority households in Binh </p><p>Phuoc Province, located along the Cambodian border.  According to </p><p>the pastors, nearly 3000 Xtieng in Loc Ninh District had been </p><p>encouraged by the GVN to register their seven Mennonite "sub- </p><p>associations" (house churches).  Instead of legal recognition, </p><p>however, they had incurred greater repression in the form of </p><p>arrests and beatings.  Recently, police and military units had </p><p>bulldozed over 100 hectares of rice fields, leaving the villagers </p><p>to live on just four meals per week.  The pastors promised to </p><p>provide photographs. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  In between the two meetings at the ConGen, the pastors </p><p>somehow managed to attend a conference in Loc Ninh that had been </p><p>in the planning stages for some time.  While 150 village leaders </p><p>were able to gather, police prevented another 150 from reaching </p><p>the site.  (In an interesting footnote, the pastors noted that </p><p>police who had ringed the area throughout the meeting were invited </p><p>to join the villagers for lunch while the pastors slipped away.) </p><p>They acknowledged that some of the villagers were "former FULRO </p><p>members," and that the Mennonites had used the village in the past </p><p>as a training site. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Troubling Allegations of Poisonings </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  The pastors cited six cases of poisonings by government </p><p>agents.  Three of the six were pastors who had been imprisoned in </p><p>Buon Me Thuot in late 2002 and were now dead.  Three other ethnic </p><p>minority religious workers from Kon Tum had lost their memories </p><p>and ability to function after government agents posing as visitors </p><p>from their home villages had poisoned them in Cambodia.  They were </p><p>now living with their families in Pleiku, where the pastors </p><p>claimed to visit them regularly.  (Their local interpreter, also </p><p>an ethnic minority pastor, is a former FULRO member.)  The pastors </p><p>asked for ConGen assistance in arranging blood tests, because they </p><p>were certain they could arrange for ConGenoffs to meet with the </p><p>victims in either HCMC or Pleiku.  Both pastors pointed out that </p><p>such acts of poisoning were common in the Quang Ngai area, the </p><p>home province of several government officials in the Central </p><p>Highlands. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Testing the Waters on POW/MIA Issues </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  The pastors shared information and photographs they </p><p>had received from various sources purporting to show the remains </p><p>of two American servicemen in the Dalat area.  They had also been </p><p>in contact with someone who claimed to know of an American </p><p>serviceman living with his Vietnamese wife and children in the </p><p>area between Lam Dong and Binh Thuan provinces.  (ConGen is </p><p>already aware of a similar-sounding case that the Joint Task Force- </p><p>Full Accounting investigated last year.)  The pastors expressed </p><p>deep concern that possession of this information might cause </p><p>serious problems for them and their sources.  Poloff promised to </p><p>put the sources in direct contact with someone from JTF-FA at </p><p>Embassy Hanoi. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Much of the information provided by these two contacts </p><p>contains sufficient detail to be verifiable, but gaining access to </p><p>some of the sites and individuals described will be easier said </p><p>than done.  While some of the information on poisonings appears to </p><p>be new and troubling, most responsible observers have already </p><p>debunked a similar story about three fatal poisonings in Dak Lak. </p><p>The fact that they didn\'t know the names of the three surviving </p><p>victims was inconsistent with their claims to have visited the men </p><p>regularly now, and been their spiritual guides in the past.  Also </p><p>startling was the emphasis on efforts to legalize the status of </p><p>Mennonite sub-associations, a 180-degree reversal of their policy </p><p>to oppose any accommodation with the GVN.  More troubling was the </p><p>open flaunting of FULRO connections (as "former" as they may be), </p><p>i.e., the frequent references to FULRO members and violence. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  While we have enjoyed a generally good relationship </p><p>with Mennonite leaders in the past, the sudden spike in the level </p><p>of histrionics over the past few weeks, coupled with the apparent </p><p>policy reversal on seeking legal recognition and sudden interest </p><p>in POW/MIA cases, leaves Post to wrestle with interesting </p><p>questions of veracity and motive.  Certainly, for the level of </p><p>surveillance they claim to be under, these individuals seem very </p><p>comfortable with coming to the ConGen and traveling widely </p><p>throughout some of the more sensitive regions in the South.  The </p><p>Mennonites have asked the USG to go to bat for them on all of </p><p>these issues and promised to provide evidence.  For now, Post will </p><p>attempt to verify as much of the information as possible and raise </p><p>appropriate points with the relevant local authorities. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
