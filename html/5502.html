<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000887 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY:  IS THE DEAL ON PAMUK AND YAPI </p><p>KREDI A SHOW STOPPER FOR THE IMF? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 676 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  As details of the Banking Board\'s January </p><p>31 deal with Cukurova Group emerge, it looks like bail-out of </p><p>the group.  The deal reschedules Cukurova\'s $5 billion debt </p><p>to two banks (Pamuk and Yapi Kredi) on favorable terms, </p><p>without requiring the group to put any cash upfront. </p><p>Furthermore, the two banks sell their 20 percent of Turkcell </p><p>(Turkey\'s largest cellphone operator) back to the group in </p><p>exchange for more debt.  IMF management has complained about </p><p>the deal to the government.  IMF staff is not yet addressing </p><p>whether this deal prevents them from completing the Fourth </p><p>Review, given other issues left to resolve (especially on the </p><p>budget), but this is a likely conclusion, per the IMF resrep. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Where\'s the Money? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On January 31, the Banking Regulation and </p><p>Supervision Board (BRSA) signed an agreement with the </p><p>Cukurova Group to resolve Cukurova\'s $5 billion debt to two </p><p>banks previously owned by Cukurova  - Pamuk and Yapi Kredi. </p><p>These two banks together represent about 20 percent of </p><p>Turkish bank assets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On February 2, BRSA released the broad outlines of </p><p>the deal to the public, which we reported last week (reftel): </p><p> Cukurova will repay a $3 billion debt to Pamukbank over 15 </p><p>years, with 3 years grace period on principal, at LIBOR plus </p><p>0.5 percent; Cukurova will repay a $2 billion debt to Yapi </p><p>Kredi over 9 years, 3 years grace on principal, at LIBOR plus </p><p>3.5 percent.  Cukurova will pledge as collateral other group </p><p>assets, most importantly its shares in Turkcell (Turkey\'s </p><p>largest cellphone operator). Cukurova will not give cash up </p><p>front, but will give Yapi Kredi Bank 50 percent of the shares </p><p>of ATEL (a prepaid phone card business) in exchange for </p><p>forgiving about $300 million of its debt to Yapi (bringing </p><p>that debt down to $2 billion).  Finally, Cukurova drops its </p><p>legal challenge to BRSA\'s take-over of the insolvent </p><p>Pamukbank, and agrees to sell its 45 percent stake in Yapi </p><p>Kredi in two years (down from an initial three years under </p><p>the draft protocol agreement in reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On February 3, BRSA Vice President Ceyla </p><p>Pazarbasioglu provided us additional information about the </p><p>deal: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--   The payment schedule for the $5 billion debt:  Cukurova </p><p>will make payments twice a year, with annual payments of only </p><p>$145 million in the first two years (during the grace period </p><p>on principal payments), rising to $460 million in year 3 and </p><p>peaking at $887 million in year 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--   Collateral pledged to secure the $5 billion debt, most </p><p>importantly Cukurova\'s 42 percent stake in Turkcell:  This 42 </p><p>percent of Turkcell includes nearly 20 percent that was owned </p><p>by the two bank subsidiaries of Cukurova Pamuk and Yapi </p><p>Kredi.  (Note: Turkcell\'s market valuation is currently about </p><p>$4 billion, down from a high of about $17 billion in 2000.) </p><p>The two banks agreed as part of this rescheduling to sell </p><p>their shares back to Cukurova, and add the sales price to the </p><p>existing debt owed by the holding company.  The theory is </p><p>that Cukurova is best situated to maximize the income stream </p><p>from Turkcell, and thus use this income to pay back its bank </p><p>debts.  (Comment;  In effect, this constitutes another loan </p><p>from the banks to Cukurova. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Yapi Kredi\'s cash position:  Rescheduling the $2 billion </p><p>debt improves Yapi\'s balance sheet (from insolvent to nearly </p><p>13 percent capital adequacy), but doesn\'t change its cash </p><p>position.  Giving Yapi non-marketable shares in ATEL also </p><p>doesn\'t translate into cash.  If Yapi\'s capital adequacy </p><p>falls below 10 percent, the deal calls for  BRSA to inject </p><p>capital into the bank and dilute Cukurova\'s 45 percent </p><p>interest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Management of Yapi Kredi. Though Cukurova will continue </p><p>owning its Yapi Kredi shares for two years (down from an </p><p>initial three years in the draft protocol agreement), BRSA </p><p>will have complete management control, and will select a </p><p>consulting firm to recommend replacements to both Yapi\'s </p><p>board and senior management.  The goal is to replace the </p><p>Cukurova people who approved the lending to the holding </p><p>company. </p><p>--  Criminal prosecution option.  BRSA waives its right to </p><p>take Cukurova to bankruptcy court, but doesn\'t waive its </p><p>rights to prosecute Cukurova or owner Karamehmet for criminal </p><p>fraud. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Asked if BRSA had looked at the option of taking over </p><p>Yapi Kredi Bank, Pazarbasioglu made the point that Cukurova </p><p>would block such a move in court, just as he had with </p><p>Pamukbank.  Noone would buy either bank with Cukurova\'s legal </p><p>claim outstanding.  The weakness of Turkey\'s legal system </p><p>dictated this kind of negotiated deal with Cukurova, </p><p>according to Pazarbasioglu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment:  Pazarbasioglu is right about the Turkish </p><p>legal system, but that still doesn\'t explain why Cukurova </p><p>wasn\'t required to put any money into either bank upfront </p><p>(and why it acquires the two banks\' shares of Turkcell in a </p><p>new loan), while its existing loan is rescheduled on </p><p>favorable terms.  The deal requires two leaps of faith: </p><p>first, that Cukurova will gain the capacity to service $450 </p><p>million plus in debt service within two years (which assumes </p><p>its telecom and high tech businesses recover); second, that </p><p>Cukurova\'s owner Karamehmet has the intention to repaying </p><p>this debt even if he does gain the capacity to do so (he </p><p>hasn\'t shown this intention previously).  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The IMF Reaction, and Press Leak </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) IMF resrep and resident banking expert tell us this </p><p>deal presents serious problems, but they need to see the </p><p>complete details  before reaching a conclusion.  Given the </p><p>lack of progress over other issues (agreement on the 2003 </p><p>budget and draft amendments to the Public Procurement Law </p><p>which would gut this reform), the Fund staff are not yet </p><p>taking the position that this deal would prevent a completion </p><p>of the Fourth Review.  But they might well reach this </p><p>conclusion, per IMF resrep.  IMF Europe Director Deppler </p><p>called BRSA Chairman Akcakoca to warn the BRSA on January 30 </p><p>not to sign the Cukurova deal until the Fund had the chance </p><p>to study the details.  IMF Managing Director Koehler followed </p><p>up with a letter to PM Gul, also faxed to Treasury and BRSA, </p><p>and then an angry phone call to Gul, asking the GOT to tell </p><p>BRSA not to sign the agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The Koehler letter was leaked to the press, and AK </p><p>Chairman Erdogan commented to the press that the IMF was </p><p>finally agreeing with AK that there were problems with the </p><p>independent regulatory boards, and that they need more </p><p>central government supervision.  (Comment:  This exchange has </p><p>further reduced the credibility and independence of the </p><p>BRSA.)  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The Pamuk and Yapi Kredi deal is signed.  Unlike </p><p>the budget and Public Procurement Law amendment impasses, it </p><p>would be difficult if not impossible for the GOT to walk it </p><p>back.  The deal at a minimum is highly favorable to Cukurova, </p><p>and looks like a partial bail-out of the group (injection of </p><p>$2.7 billion of GOT paper into Pamuk, regulatory forbearance </p><p>and possible future injection into Yapi Kredi). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
