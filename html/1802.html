(U)  FLOODING IN NORTHERN VIETNAM:  RAINY SEASON IS UPON </p><p>US.  TYPHOON NO. 2 (DURIAN) WAS DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL </p><p>DEPRESSION JUST BEFORE IT HIT THE MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS OF </p><p>NORTHERN VIETNAM JULY 2-4 CAUSING FLOODING AND MUDSLIDES, </p><p>KILLING AT LEAST 30 PEOPLE AND DAMAGING NEARLY OVER 30,000 </p><p>HOMES.  HARDEST HIT, BY WHAT IS BEING CALLED THE WORST </p><p>FLOODING TO HIT NORTHERN VIETNAM IN YEARS, ARE THE REGIONS </p><p>BORDERING THE THAI NGUYEN, CAU AND LO RIVERS, AND AT LEAST </p><p>SIX PROVINCES HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY AFFECTED.  LOCAL DISASTER </p><p>RELIEF EFFORTS ARE REACHING OUT TO THE VICTIMS.  THE GVN HAS </p><p>NOT ISSUED A CALL FOR INTERNATIONAL DISASTER RELIEF.  BUT, </p><p>TYPHOON NO. 3 (UTOR), WHICH WREAKED HAVOC IN THE PHILIPPINES </p><p>AND TAIWAN, HIT CHINA LAST FRIDAY, AND ALTHOUGH IT TOO WAS </p><p>DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION, IT APPEARS TO BE HEADED </p><p>TO HIT NORTHERN VIETNAM SHORTLY.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS WARNED </p><p>PEOPLE TO BE PREPARED.  THE QUESTION REMAINS JUST HOW MUCH </p><p>MORE RAIN THE WATER-LOGGED HILLSIDES AND SWOLLEN RIVERS CAN </p><p>MANAGE WITHOUT CAUSING A MORE WIDESPREAD DISASTER.  HYDRO- </p><p>METEOROLOGY OFFICE PERSONNEL TELL US, HOWEVER, THERE IS NO </p><p>IMMEDIATE THREAT IN THE RED RIVER (HANOI AREA) DESPITE THE </p><p>GENERALLY RISING WATERS IN NORTHERN RIVERS.  POST WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE SITUATION CLOSELY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) SON LA HYDROELECTRIC FACILITY APPROVED: AFTER YEARS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01629  01 OF 02  091052Z </p><p>OF DEBATE, VIETNAM IS COMING CLOSER TO CONSTRUCTING A HUGE </p><p>NEW HYDROELECTRIC FACILITY IN SON LAW PROVINCE.  IN THE </p><p>CLOSING DAYS ITS MOST RECENT SESSION, VIETNAM\'S NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY OFFICIALLY "APPROVED IN PRINCIPLE" CONSTRUCTION OF </p><p>THE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR SON LA HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT, </p><p>WHILE STILL RESERVING ON HOW BIG THE DAM PROJECT WILL </p><p>ACTUALLY BE.  TWO WEEKS BEFORE, THE POLITBURO HAD APPROVED </p><p>THE PROJECT.  AND DESPITE VOCAL OBJECTIONS FROM A NUMBER OF </p><p>ASSEMBLY DELEGATES, VIETNAM\'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP PRESSED </p><p>FORWARD WITH THE VOTE.  THE DAM AND POWER FACILITY ARE TO BE </p><p>LOCATED ON THE DA RIVER UPSTREAM FROM THE HOA BINH </p><p>HYDROELECTRIC DAM.  THREE OPTIONS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THE </p><p>LARGEST OF WHICH WOULD INUNDATE 440 SQ. KILOMETERS, DISPLACE </p><p>UP TO 100,000 OF THE MOSTLY INDIGENOUS LOCAL POPULATION, AND </p><p>COST UP TO US$ 4 BILLION.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOW PRODUCE </p><p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON EACH OF THE OPTIONS, AND THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL HOLD A FINAL VOTE DURING ITS FALL </p><p>SESSION.  AT PRESENT, PLANS ARE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT BY </p><p>2016. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) SON LA DAM CON\'T:  SUPPORTERS ARGUE THAT VIETNAM </p><p>URGENTLY NEEDS EXPANDED ELECTRICITY GENERATING CAPACITY AND </p><p>SHOULD NOT RELY ONLY ON GAS-FIRED POWER FACILITIES WHICH </p><p>HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE VUNG TAU-BA RIA AND </p><p>WILL USE GAS FROM THE HUGE NAM CON SON GAS FIELD.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THEY ARGUE THAT THIS DAM WILL BE USED FOR </p><p>IRRIGATION IN THE SURROUNDING PROVINCES AND TO CONTROL </p><p>FLOODING DOWNSTREAM ON THE RED RIVER AND THAI BINH DELTAS </p><p>DURING THE RAINY SEASON. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) SON LA DAM CON\'T:  BUT THE DELEGATES IN OPPOSITION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01629  01 OF 02  091052Z </p><p>VOICED MANY OF THE SAME OBJECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN VOICED FOR </p><p>YEARS.  FIRST, IT IS ARGUED THERE WILL BE VAST ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>DAMAGE IN THE CATCHMENT AREAS SURROUNDING THE DAM DUE TO </p><p>FLOODING AND TREE LOSS AS WELL AS DOWNSTREAM.  SAFETY </p><p>CONCERNS ARE PERHAPS EVEN MORE PRESSING.  THE DAM WOULD BE </p><p>LOCATED IN AN EARTHQUAKE PRONE REGION AND IT IS FEARED THAT </p><p>A BREACH IN THE DAM WOULD CAUSE THE HOA BINH DAM TO </p><p>COLLAPSE, INUNDATING HANOI IN UP TO FIVE STORIES OF WATER IN </p><p>A MATTER OF HOURS.  THESE ARGUMENTS GAINED GREATER CREDENCE </p><p>EARLIER THIS YEAR AFTER NEAR-BY LAI CHAU PROVINCE WAS HIT </p><p>WITH AN EARTHQUAKE MEASURING 5.3 ON THE RICHTER SCALE AND </p><p>CAUSING SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF STRUCTURAL DAMAGE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  SON LA DAM CON\'T:  OTHERS ARGUE THAT THERE HAS NOT </p><p>BEEN SUFFICIENT THOUGHT GIVEN TO THE LOGISTICS AND FINANCES </p><p>REQUIRED TO RELOCATE ALL THOSE THAT WILL BE DISPLACED. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, MANY WORRY THAT THE CURRENT PLAN TO SEND THE </p><p>DISPLACED POPULATION TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WILL FURTHER </p><p>DESTABILIZE THIS REGION WHICH WAS ROCKED BY PROTESTS ON THE </p><p>PART OF SOME OF THE REGION\'S INDIGENOUS POPULATION IN </p><p>FEBRUARY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  SON LA DAM CON\'T:  FINALLY, THERE ARE SERIOUS </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW VIETNAM WILL FINANCE THE PROJECT.  IN </p><p>THE PAST, THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT HAS INDICATED IT WILL </p><p>FINANCE THE PROJECT OUT OF THE STATE BUDGET.  HOWEVER, MORE </p><p>RECENTLY VIETNAM NEWS QUOTED ONE OFFICIAL AS SAYING THAT 30 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE FUNDING WOULD COME FROM FOREIGN LOANS. </p><p>HOWEVER,  WORLD BANK AND OTHER DONORS WILL BE UNLIKELY TO </p><p>PROVIDE FUNDING GIVEN CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY, THE ENVIRONMENT </p><p>AND DISPLACED PERSONS.  AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS UNLIKELY </p><p>TO BE AN OPTION, EVEN IF THE GVN IS WILLING TO CONSIDER </p><p>PERMITTING IT, GIVEN THE PROBLEMS VIETNAM HAS HAD IN THE </p><p>PAST COMING TO AGREEMENT WITH PRIVATE INVESTORS ON OTHER </p><p>ELECTRICITY GENERATION PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) SON LA DAM - COMMENT: FOR NOW AT LEAST, THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP SEEMS DETERMINED TO IGNORE THE </p><p>QUESTIONS AND MOVE FORWARD.  BUT EVENTUALLY, THESE CONCERNS </p><p>WILL HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED.  ONE HOPES THAT THIS OCCURS </p><p>SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WHEN CONSTRUCTION IS STARTED, </p><p>PEOPLE ARE MOVING AND FUNDS BEING SPENT.  COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
