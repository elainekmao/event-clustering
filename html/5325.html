<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 07 ABUJA 000159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: 2002 INCSR SUBMISSION </p><p> </p><p>The following is Post\'s submission of the 2002 Nigeria </p><p>INCSR Chapter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria remains a hub of narcotics trafficking and money </p><p>laundering activity. Nigerian organized criminal groups </p><p>dominate the African drug trade and transport narcotics to </p><p>markets in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa. </p><p>Some of these criminal organizations are engaged in </p><p>advance-fee fraud, commonly referred to in Nigeria as "419 </p><p>Fraud," and other forms of defrauding U.S. citizens and </p><p>businesses. Years of military rule and an associated </p><p>economic decline contributed significantly to the expansion </p><p>of drug trafficking and criminality in Nigeria. The </p><p>resulting severe unemployment and widespread corruption </p><p>provided both an incentive and a mechanism for Nigerian </p><p>criminal groups to capitalize on Nigeria\'s central location </p><p>along the major drug routes and access to global narcotics </p><p>markets. Nigeria remains one of the world\'s most corrupt </p><p>nations, according to Transparency International, a well </p><p>respected international NGO.  The democratically elected </p><p>government of President Olusegun Obasanjo has faced steep </p><p>challenges in checking organized crime emanating from </p><p>Nigeria.  Southeast and Southwest Asian heroin smuggled via </p><p>Nigeria accounts for a significant portion of the heroin </p><p>imported into the United States. Nigerian criminal elements </p><p>operating in South America trans-ship cocaine through </p><p>Nigeria to Europe, Asia, and Africa. South Africa is a </p><p>major destination for Nigerian-trafficked cocaine within </p><p>Africa.  Nigerian-grown marijuana is exported to </p><p>neighboring West African countries and to Europe, but not </p><p>in significant quantities to the United States. Aside from </p><p>marijuana, Nigeria does not produce any of the drugs that </p><p>its nationals traffic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Commitments to confronting organized crime and drug </p><p>trafficking made by the Administration of President </p><p>Obasanjo led to several watershed events in 2002 including </p><p>the first extradition of a U.S. fugitive in August and the </p><p>passage of crucial money laundering legislation in </p><p>December.  On January 14, 2003, the instruments of </p><p>ratification of the U.S.-Nigerian Mutual Legal Assistance </p><p>Treaty (MLAT) were formally exchanged and the Treaty was </p><p>entered into force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, throughout the year, the looming April 2003 </p><p>elections demanded increasing attention by senior elected </p><p>GON officials.  As a result, the fulfillment of previous </p><p>law enforcement commitments diminished.  A 2002 budget </p><p>battle between the executive and legislative branch -- </p><p>provoked largely by the looming elections -- resulted in an </p><p>impasse and caused funding shortfalls for key law </p><p>enforcement agencies such as the Independent Corrupt </p><p>Practices and Other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC) and </p><p>the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).  The </p><p>former, Nigeria\'s fledgling agency charged with addressing </p><p>the country\'s image as the world\'s most corrupt nation, </p><p>received far less funding that it had requested to build a </p><p>dedicated staff and bring high-level corrupt officials to </p><p>justice.  Similarly, the NDLEA, Nigeria\'s sole anti-drug </p><p>agency, suffered from far below-normal operational funding </p><p>through most of the year, though it was given a special </p><p>allocation by President Obasanjo in the final quarter of </p><p>the year.  Nigeria\'s drug enforcement performance has not </p><p>advanced significantly from past years, in part due to this </p><p>funding problem.  Major traffickers remain difficult to </p><p>reach by the GON\'s investigative and prosecution efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Kanu Agabi became Attorney General in March 2002, filling a </p><p>void in the top law enforcement position created by the </p><p>December 2001 assassination of the late Bola Ige.  Strong </p><p>law enforcement cooperation begun under Ige\'s tenure </p><p>continued and is expanding under Attorney General Agabi\'s </p><p>strong leadership.   We are concerned, however, about the </p><p>Nigerian Government\'s inability to solve the murder of its </p><p>top law enforcement official, who was killed over a year </p><p>ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite budgetary shortfalls and challenges to its </p><p>authority from legislative members under investigation for </p><p>corruption, Nigeria\'s anti-corruption commission -- the </p><p>ICPC -- produced significant gains in 2002.  Nigeria </p><p>instituted a campaign to root out corruption that started </p><p>shortly after President Obasanjo\'s inauguration in May </p><p>1999, a campaign that was sustained and strengthened in </p><p>2001. In late 2001, the ICPC hired 93 investigators, </p><p>prosecutors, and administrators, its first contingent of </p><p>personnel not detailed from other agencies. The Obasanjo </p><p>administration supports the domestically controversial 1990 </p><p>NDLEA Act Number 33. This law dictates that Nigerians </p><p>convicted of drug offenses abroad will be arrested upon </p><p>their deportation back to Nigeria, and, if convicted, will </p><p>be liable for a maximum of five years additional </p><p>imprisonment for harming the reputation of Nigeria.  Use of </p><p>this law, however, has diminished; only one conviction was </p><p>handed down in 2002.  Corruption embedded over 16 years of </p><p>continuous military rule continues to be a problem for the </p><p>Obasanjo government, with the administration itself having </p><p>suffered from a number of corruption scandals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the NDLEA encountered limited success in combating </p><p>the various elements of the drug trade.  Typically, street </p><p>pushers and trafficker "mules" were apprehended; the effort </p><p>against large-scale traffickers, however, was less </p><p>effective. While operational efforts against the drug trade </p><p>remain modest, the Obasanjo government in 2002 made good on </p><p>previous commitments to create a structure to identify and </p><p>interdict the proceeds of crime -- a major criminal issue </p><p>in Nigeria, as highlighted by the Financial Action Task </p><p>Force (FATF).    This body, the Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission, will be established through the December 14, </p><p>2002 enactment of the Terrorism, Economic and Financial </p><p>Crimes Commission Act.  Moreover, the Obasanjo government </p><p>introduced, and the National Assembly in December passed, </p><p>legislation to improve the existing 1995 Money Laundering </p><p>Act that had previously only criminalized money laundering </p><p>related to drug trafficking. Asset forfeiture has not been </p><p>a successful deterrent against money laundering or drug </p><p>trafficking activities. Corruption among enforcement </p><p>officials and the judiciary raises serious questions about </p><p>whether this particular sanction can be applied </p><p>consistently enough to have a salutary effect, quite apart </p><p>from the technical difficulty of putting together a </p><p>particular case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Interdiction and enforcement efforts are complicated by an </p><p>absence of inter-agency cooperation and a serious lack of </p><p>resources. Years of neglect by successive military regimes </p><p>left the law enforcement community demoralized and ill- </p><p>equipped to deal with sophisticated international criminal </p><p>networks. This problem is compounded by pervasive </p><p>corruption throughout all levels of government. There have </p><p>been a few arrests of major traffickers; however, it can </p><p>take years for a case to come to trial and no mechanism </p><p>exists to track cases. Cases are often "systematically </p><p>lost" within Nigeria\'s judicial system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>II. Status of Country </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria produces no precursor chemicals or drugs that have </p><p>a significant effect on the United States, but it remains a </p><p>major drug-transit country. In addition, Nigerian criminal </p><p>elements operate global trafficking/criminal networks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NLDEA is the law enforcement agency with sole </p><p>responsibility for combating narcotics trafficking and drug </p><p>abuse. It was established in 1989, and works alongside </p><p>Nigerian Customs, the State Security Service, the National </p><p>Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control </p><p>(NAFDAC), the National Police, and the Nigerian Immigration </p><p>Service at various ports of entry. The NDLEA\'s most </p><p>successful interdictions have taken place at Nigeria\'s </p><p>international airports, with over 50 percent of  hard drug </p><p>seizures (e.g. cocaine and heroin) at the Lagos </p><p>international airport.  The agency has successfully </p><p>apprehended individual drug couriers transiting these </p><p>airports and some of the drug traffickers sponsoring these </p><p>couriers. An improved interdiction effort at the Lagos </p><p>international airport during 2001 has forced some smugglers </p><p>to change tactics and ship contraband via Nigeria\'s five </p><p>major seaports or to neighboring countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NDLEA seizures of hard drugs in 2002 were modest; no one </p><p>seizure exceeded 15 kilograms, unlike its success in 2001 </p><p>in seizing a shipment of 60 kilograms of cocaine at the </p><p>Lagos port and despite continuing evidence of large drug </p><p>shipments transiting Nigeria en route to the United States </p><p>and Europe.  Prosecutions of drug couriers -- those </p><p>carrying small amounts of hard drugs in baggage or </p><p>internally ingested -- remained strong, while  prosecution </p><p>of major drug barons evidenced little progress. The </p><p>improved access of the NDLEA to Nigeria\'s major seaports, </p><p>as granted by Presidential decree in 2001, has not resulted </p><p>in  any significant improvement in drug enforcement at </p><p>these key interdiction points, in part due to the under- </p><p>funding of the NDLEA and resistance to NDLEA operations by </p><p>the Nigerian Customs Service. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigerian criminal organizations, sophisticated specialists </p><p>in moving narcotics and other contraband,  are heavily </p><p>involved in corollary criminal activities such as document </p><p>fabrication, illegal immigration, and financial fraud. </p><p>Their ties to criminals in the United States, Europe, South </p><p>America, Asia, and South Africa are well documented. </p><p>Nigerian poly-crime organizations exact significant </p><p>financial and societal costs, especially among West African </p><p>states with limited resources for countering these </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>III. Country Actions Against Drugs in 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Policy Initiatives. In 2002, the democratically elected </p><p>Obasanjo Administration pushed forward a number of new </p><p>legislative and executive initiatives to combat narcotics </p><p>trafficking and organized crime. These initiatives </p><p>included: the passage of new money laundering legislation </p><p>and the creation of an Anti-Terrorism, Economic and </p><p>Financial Crimes Commission to coordinate government-wide </p><p>efforts against money laundering and financial crimes. </p><p>The draft bill to create an Anti-Terrorism, Economic and </p><p>Financial Crimes Commission shows the government\'s </p><p>commitment to meeting its international obligations, </p><p>particularly the criteria of the FATF. Nigeria\'s counter- </p><p>narcotics policy is based on the National Drug Control </p><p>Master Plan (NDCMP), which has been in place since 1998. </p><p>This plan assigns responsibilities to various government </p><p>Ministries and agencies as well as NGOs and other interest </p><p>groups. The Master Plan also outlines basic resource </p><p>requirements and time-frames for the completion of </p><p>objectives. Many of these goals have not yet been met. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Both chambers in the National Assembly have Narcotics </p><p>Affairs Committees, which monitor the performance of the </p><p>NDLEA and implementation of Nigeria\'s counter-narcotics </p><p>strategy. While frequent leadership changes at the NDLEA </p><p>impaired the agency\'s effectiveness in the past, the </p><p>current NDLEA Chairman, Alhaji Bello Lafiaji, who assumed </p><p>office in October 2000, has given the agency new life and </p><p>much greater direction. Chairman Lafiaji has declared an </p><p>all-out offensive against drug trafficking and has </p><p>instituted a number of internal reforms to improve the </p><p>professionalism of NDLEA staff, including the retirement of </p><p>officials suspected of corruption and improved training and </p><p>benefits for NDLEA personnel. Chairman Lafiaji also has </p><p>called for harmonization of Nigeria\'s narcotics legislation </p><p>and has sought increased international assistance for his </p><p>agency. The NDLEA has also embarked upon a publicity </p><p>campaign to combat narcotics trafficking and drug abuse by </p><p>staging various contraband destruction events around the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Accomplishments.  The increased level of drug enforcement </p><p>begun in 2001 was sustained but not improved in 2002.  With </p><p>assistance from the Department of State\'s Bureau for </p><p>International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) </p><p>and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the NDLEA </p><p>was given enhanced capacity to launch more aggressive drug </p><p>interdiction campaigns and investigative efforts against </p><p>drug barons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Nigerian government also improved its record of drug- </p><p>related prosecutions. Using special drug courts, a more </p><p>energetic effort by the NDLEA to prosecute drug traffickers </p><p>efficiently and successfully produced over 2,000 </p><p>convictions in 2001.  The NDLEA also demonstrated stronger </p><p>efforts to enforce Nigeria\'s money laundering law; by the </p><p>end of 2002, five banks were under NDLEA investigation for </p><p>alleged complicity in the laundering of drug proceeds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NDLEA has also proven itself as an effective drug </p><p>enforcement leader in the region.  With DEA assistance, the </p><p>NDLEA created the West African Joint Operation (WAJO) </p><p>initiative, bringing together drug enforcement personnel </p><p>from 15 countries in the region to improve regional </p><p>cooperation.  Several WAJO meetings organized by the NDLEA </p><p>and DEA during 2002 culminated in a month-long joint </p><p>interdiction operation in ten countries, leading to </p><p>cumulative seizures of hard drugs totaling more than 50 </p><p>kilograms.  The NDLEA remains committed to continued </p><p>regional cooperation and also has expanded counter- </p><p>narcotics cooperation with the police in South Africa, </p><p>where Nigerian criminal organizations are responsible for </p><p>the bulk of drug trafficking.  In 2002, NDLEA attended the </p><p>International Drug Enforcement Conference (IDEC) in Santa </p><p>Cruz, Bolivia and became the first African permanent member </p><p>of this forum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Nigeria also pledged to design a </p><p>mechanism to process U.S. extradition requests </p><p>expeditiously while observing due process under Nigerian </p><p>law, in accordance with the Nigerian constitution. This </p><p>mechanism will include the creation of an exclusive </p><p>extradition team of public prosecutors and the designation </p><p>of a High Court judge dedicated to extradition cases. In </p><p>December 2001, the (late) Attorney General designated a </p><p>High Court judge exclusively to hear extradition cases. </p><p>While extradition requests were formerly heard in any </p><p>court, including lower magistrates courts, the government </p><p>has now centralized the handling of all U.S. extradition </p><p>requests in the Federal High Court of Abuja.  In late 2002, </p><p>Gabriel Umoh was extradited to the United States to serve a </p><p>prison sentence for financial fraud.  This marked the first </p><p>judicial extradition of a U.S. fugitive from Nigeria in </p><p>over 10 years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At Nigeria\'s initiative, a high level U.S.-Nigeria law </p><p>enforcement dialogue began in 2001. The first meeting of </p><p>this semi-annual forum, the Bilateral Law Enforcement </p><p>Committee, took place on November 9 in Washington, D.C. and </p><p>was followed by a second meeting in Abuja in December 2002. </p><p>These meetings covered the full range of U.S. and Nigerian </p><p>law enforcement interests: drug control; financial fraud; </p><p>trafficking in persons; corruption; immigration crimes; </p><p>police reform; extradition; and money laundering. The </p><p>dialogue has already led to commitments by Nigeria to take </p><p>significant steps toward mutually agreed goals by March </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Law Enforcement Efforts. Nigerian counter-narcotics efforts </p><p>primarily focus on the interdiction of couriers transiting </p><p>Nigeria\'s air and seaports as well as a public campaign </p><p>focused on destroying plots of cultivated marijuana </p><p>throughout the country.  Improved drug interdiction efforts </p><p>at the Lagos airport and seaports led to a 40 percent </p><p>increase in total drug seizures over 2000.  91.79 kilograms </p><p>of heroin and 24.04 kilograms of cocaine were seized during </p><p>2002, as compared with 43 kilograms of heroin and 98 </p><p>kilograms of cocaine seized in 2001.  Combined hard drug </p><p>seizures declined 20 percent in 2002. The number of drug- </p><p>related arrests fell to 1,960 from 3,592 in 2001, and 915 </p><p>drug convictions were handed down during 2002, compared to </p><p>2,041 in 2001.  Major narcotics smugglers and their </p><p>networks continue to elude arrest and prosecution, despite </p><p>a NDLEA commitment to  launch an intensified effort to </p><p>investigate major international drug traffickers operating </p><p>in Nigeria.  Attempts by the NDLEA to arrest and prosecute </p><p>major traffickers and their associates often fail in </p><p>Nigeria\'s courts, which are subject to intimidation and </p><p>corruption. Asset seizures from narcotics traffickers and </p><p>money launderers, while permitted under Nigerian law, have </p><p>never been systematically utilized as an enforcement tool, </p><p>but some convicted traffickers have had their assets </p><p>forfeited over the years. The number of traffickers so far </p><p>penalized, however, remains small. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corruption. Corruption is pervasive in Nigerian society and </p><p>a systemic problem in Nigeria\'s government. Estimated </p><p>unemployment is over 25 percent. Civil servants\' salaries </p><p>are low. In addition, salaries are frequently months in </p><p>arrears, compounding the corruption problem. After its </p><p>inauguration, the Obasanjo Administration embarked on a </p><p>public anti-corruption campaign. Legislation was enacted </p><p>and the ICPC was formed. This commission began prosecution </p><p>of several minor officials on corruption charges, and </p><p>initiated investigations into allegations of high-level </p><p>corruption, but has been stymied by slow recruitment, </p><p>inadequate federal funding, and a series of court </p><p>challenges questioning the legitimacy legality of the </p><p>Commission.  The ICPC hired its first non-seconded staff of </p><p>prosecutors, investigators, and administrators in 2001 but </p><p>has been unable to expand its staff further in 2002.. The </p><p>U.S. Department of Justice, with INL funding, is providing </p><p>the ICPC with training and technical assistance for its new </p><p>staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Obasanjo Administration, unfortunately, has made </p><p>limited progress toward transparency and openness in its </p><p>contracting and decision making process. A number of </p><p>criminal cases, launched by the Anti-Corruption Commission </p><p>against public officials accused of bribe-taking, are </p><p>moving forward and are expected to conclude early in 2002, </p><p>although an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the </p><p>ICPC\'s constitutionality has delayed these cases. </p><p>Meanwhile, corruption remains a significant obstacle to </p><p>counter-narcotics efforts, especially in the courts. While </p><p>the NDLEA has attempted to purge its ranks of officers </p><p>suspected of corrupt practices, a fear of corruption </p><p>hampers inter-agency cooperation as agencies are often </p><p>distrustful and unwilling to share information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agreements and Treaties. Nigeria is a party to the 1988 UN </p><p>Drug Convention, the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic </p><p>Drugs, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, and the 1971 UN </p><p>Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  Nigeria has signed </p><p>the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, </p><p>the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in </p><p>Persons, the Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants, </p><p>and the Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and </p><p>Trafficking in Firearms. The 1931 U.S.-UK Extradition </p><p>Treaty, which was made applicable to Nigeria in 1935, is </p><p>the legal basis for pending U.S. extradition requests. In </p><p>1989, the United States and Nigeria entered into a mutual </p><p>cooperation agreement for reducing demand, preventing </p><p>illicit use, and combating illicit production and </p><p>trafficking in drugs. The United States and Nigeria also </p><p>signed in 1989 a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), </p><p>which was ratified in 2001 and is entered into force on </p><p>January 14, 2003.  Nigeria is a party to the World Customs </p><p>Organization\'s Nairobi Convention, Annex on Assistance in </p><p>Narcotics Cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cultivation/Production. Cannabis is the only illicit drug </p><p>produced in any large quantities in Nigeria. The drug is </p><p>cultivated in all 36 states. Major cultivation takes place </p><p>in central and northern Nigeria and in Delta and Ondo </p><p>states in the south. Marijuana, or "Indian Hemp" as it is </p><p>known locally, is sold in Nigeria and exported throughout </p><p>West Africa and into Europe. To date, there is no evidence </p><p>of significant marijuana imports from Nigeria into the </p><p>United States. The NDLEA has been engaged in an active </p><p>eradication campaign. Throughout 2002, the NDLEA claimed to </p><p>have seized more than 304 metric tons of cannabis, a slight </p><p>increase from the 290 metric tons seized in 2001.  In June </p><p>2002, the NLDEA invited dignitaries and the diplomatic </p><p>corps to a narcotics destruction ceremony in Lagos to </p><p>highlight the agency\'s seizures of illicit drugs throughout </p><p>the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Drug Flow/Transit. Nigeria is a major staging point for </p><p>Southeast and Southwest Asian heroin smuggled to Europe and </p><p>the United States and for South American cocaine trafficked </p><p>to Europe. While Nigeria remains Africa\'s drug transit hub, </p><p>there are indications that the preferred methods of trans- </p><p>shipment have changed. Improvement of the overall security </p><p>posture at Lagos\' Murtala Mohammed International Airport </p><p>has prompted some drug traffickers to ship more narcotics </p><p>through Nigerian seaports, concealing large quantities of </p><p>contraband in shipping containers. They also use other West </p><p>African airports and sea ports with more lax security </p><p>controls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Domestic Programs (Demand Reduction). Local production and </p><p>use of marijuana have been a problem in Nigeria for some </p><p>time; however, according to the NDLEA and NGOs, the abuse </p><p>of harder drugs (e.g., cocaine, heroin) is now on the rise. </p><p>Heroin and cocaine are readily available in many of </p><p>Nigeria\'s larger cities. Law enforcement officials admit </p><p>that Nigeria remains a major narcotics trans-shipment </p><p>point, but some officials deny that domestic drug abuse is </p><p>on the rise. U.S. officials and training instructors find </p><p>that many Nigerian officials do not understand that by </p><p>serving as a transit point, Nigeria may itself begin to </p><p>suffer significant drug abuse problems, like many other </p><p>similar transit points worldwide. The NDLEA continues to </p><p>expand its counter-narcotics clubs at Nigerian universities </p><p>and distribute counter-narcotics literature. The NDLEA also </p><p>has instituted a teacher\'s manual for primary and secondary </p><p>schools, which offers guidance on teaching students about </p><p>drug abuse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IV. U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Policy Initiatives. U.S.-Nigerian counter-narcotics </p><p>cooperation focuses on interdiction efforts at major </p><p>international entry points and on professionalizing the </p><p>NDLEA and other law enforcement agencies. U.S. training and </p><p>material assistance have continued, with the NDLEA as the </p><p>primary target. The DEA office in Nigeria deals with a </p><p>small group of NDLEA representatives to lessen the chance </p><p>of compromise by corrupt individuals. USG working-level </p><p>representatives enjoy good excellent access to their </p><p>counterparts and there is an evident desire on both sides </p><p>to strengthen these relationships. The current NDLEA </p><p>chairman appears committed to meeting agency goals and </p><p>improving the morale of NDLEA officers. The United States </p><p>and Nigeria signed a Letter of Agreement covering many </p><p>aspects of law enforcement assistance, including a new </p><p>U.S.-funded police reform program in 2002. The Nigerian </p><p>government has reviewed plans for reform and U.S. agencies </p><p>have presented their own suggestions for ways to proceed, </p><p>but the task will be formidable as the police lack so much </p><p>in the way of equipment, logistical support and a living </p><p>wage.  Police morale has suffered over the years as the </p><p>situation deteriorated. For example, salaries, in addition </p><p>to being low, are frequently months in arrears. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral Accomplishments. In 2001, at the request of the </p><p>GON, a U.S.-Nigeria Bilateral Law Enforcement Committee was </p><p>created to advance mutual drug and crime control issues. </p><p>Co-chaired by Nigeria\'s Attorney General and the State </p><p>Department\'s Assistant Secretary for International </p><p>Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, the group met for </p><p>the first time in November 2001 in Washington.  A second </p><p>meeting convened in Abuja in December 2002.  These meetings </p><p>produced joint declarations containing Government of </p><p>Nigeria pledges to: introduce new money laundering </p><p>legislation; begin investigations of  major drug </p><p>traffickers in cooperation with DEA; commence extradition </p><p>proceedings of individuals wanted for prosecution by the </p><p>U.S. government; and boost resources for the new Anti- </p><p>Corruption Commission.  Most of these benchmarks have been </p><p>met and some have been exceeded. Meanwhile, the DEA office </p><p>in Nigeria continues to work with the NDLEA on expanding </p><p>their relationship. New Department of State assistance to </p><p>the NDLEA allowed for a stronger interdiction posture at </p><p>the Lagos international airport, Nigeria\'s largest drug </p><p>transit point, forcing many traffickers to route drug </p><p>shipments through neighboring countries. Department of </p><p>State assistance and U.S. Secret Service operational </p><p>support have also been provided to the Nigerian Police </p><p>Force to improve investigations and enforcement operations </p><p>against criminal organizations involved in advance fee or </p><p>419 Fraud, which largely targets American citizens and </p><p>businesses and other Western nationals. The United States </p><p>also provided training for NDLEA personnel on general </p><p>investigative techniques and embarked on a project to </p><p>support the NDLEA\'s training academy in Jos, Plateau State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Road Ahead. After yeas of non-cooperation, the U.S.- </p><p>Nigerian relationship expanded after the 1999 </p><p>reintroduction of democratic government in Nigeria. Despite </p><p>a prolonged budgetary impasse in 2002 that limited most GON </p><p>agencies to operating budgets of 40-50 percent of  2001 </p><p>levels, President Obasanjo demonstrated his commitment to </p><p>the international drug fight by granting the NDLEA a </p><p>special allotment exceeding the NDLEA\'s 2001 budget. </p><p>Nevertheless, federal funding for the NDLEA and other key </p><p>Nigerian law enforcement agencies remains insufficient and </p><p>erratic in disbursement.  This inadequate funding is </p><p>believed partially the cause of key weaknesses -- including </p><p>the processing of U.S. extradition requests and the local </p><p>prosecution of major drug traffickers -- that need to be </p><p>addressed by the Nigerian Government. As noted elsewhere in </p><p>this report, the narcotics and crime problems in Nigeria </p><p>are deeply rooted in Nigeria\'s present governmental system, </p><p>and in Nigerian society. It will require strong and </p><p>sustained political will and continued international </p><p>assistance for any Nigerian government to confront these </p><p>difficult issues and bring about meaningful change. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. government has expanded aid to Nigeria\'s counter- </p><p>narcotics efforts; anti-drug assistance provided since </p><p>February 2001 now totals over $1.2 million.  Another area </p><p>of  key concern is the performance of Nigeria\'s judiciary. </p><p>Law enforcement efforts are often stymied by the slow pace </p><p>of the judicial system, which can be attributed to both </p><p>intimidation and corruption of the judiciary by criminal </p><p>organizations. The U.S. Agency for International </p><p>Development is expanding a "rule of law" program with the </p><p>Nigerian government to help strengthen and professionalize </p><p>the judiciary. Through the framework of the new Bilateral </p><p>Law Enforcement Committee, the Nigerian government has made </p><p>good on its commitment to the establishment of a reliable </p><p>extradition process that allows extradition requests to be </p><p>heard expeditiously and fairly. Nevertheless, many U.S. </p><p>extradition requests for narcotics traffickers have been </p><p>outstanding for years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although Nigeria does not produce reliable crime </p><p>statistics, most observers agree that public security </p><p>deteriorated throughout the country in 2002.  The police </p><p>remain grossly mistrusted by the Nigerian populous and </p><p>organized crime groups exploited that mistrust by preying </p><p>on citizens throughout the nation, but particularly in key </p><p>urban areas such as Lagos, Enugu, Port Hartcourt, Jos, Kano </p><p>and Kaduna. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In early 2002 the Inspector General of Police was removed </p><p>by the President, a move widely believed to have been </p><p>linked to the IGP\'s alleged corruption and the failure to </p><p>contain un unprecedented December 2001-January 2002 police </p><p>strike over unpaid salaries and allowances.  A newly </p><p>appointed IGP, Tafa Balogun, began his tenure by announcing </p><p>an eight-point plan to tackle corruption and crime, </p><p>including an approach to dealing with violent criminals he </p><p>termed "Fire-for-Fire"  This was later followed by a </p><p>"Shoot-To-Kill" policy announced by the Inspector General. </p><p>These policies, while designed to address aggressively </p><p>violent crime, resulted in a dramatic increase in the </p><p>excessive use of force by police officers and the killing </p><p>of numerous innocent civilians throughout the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigerian police are poorly trained.  Most new constables </p><p>and corporals -- the bulk of the force -- have never </p><p>qualified in the use of a firearm, yet they are given </p><p>automatic weapons and the implicit and explicit license to </p><p>use excessive force.  A standing internal police order </p><p>allows police personnel confronting an unarmed riotous </p><p>group to use firearms if they feel threatened. </p><p>Implementation of a 2001 Presidential order to recruit </p><p>40,000 new police constables each year exacerbates the </p><p>problem of absorbing poorly trained police into the force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In late 2002 the U.S. government embarked on a project to </p><p>assist the Nigerian Police Force in addressing fundamental </p><p>problems caused or exacerbated by 16 years of military </p><p>rule, during which the Police Force was denied material and </p><p>human resources.  This project seeks to provide the </p><p>Nigerian Police with a roadmap for adopting reforms that </p><p>will provide greater transparency and checks and balances </p><p>to current management practices, and reorient police </p><p>officers to community policing.  While President Obasanjo </p><p>and his advisors are aware of the need to modernize the </p><p>police as a key pillar of democratic consolidation, little </p><p>has been done to address key issues such as a living wage </p><p>for the police and other law enforcement personnel. Salary </p><p>arrears also remain a problem. The Government of Nigeria </p><p>needs to demonstrate a commitment of its own resources to </p><p>reorienting the police to serve the public rather than </p><p>preying on the population to earn a living. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. government will continue to actively engage </p><p>Nigeria on the issues of counter-narcotics and money </p><p>laundering. There have been important successes in the last </p><p>year, but long-term progress will only come through the </p><p>continuation of serious dialogue and cooperation, and a </p><p>willingness on the part of Nigeria\'s government to confront </p><p>difficult issues. The underlying institutional and societal </p><p>factors that contribute to narcotics-trafficking and money- </p><p>laundering activities in Nigeria are deep-seated and </p><p>require comprehensive, long-term solutions.  Progress can </p><p>only be made through sustained effort, political will, and </p><p>support by Nigeria\'s friends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
