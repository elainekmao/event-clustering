(C) SUMMARY.  IN THE BUILD-UP TO PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MAY </p><p>27-28 VISIT TO ROME, THE GOI GOT BUSY ON BIOTECH.  PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI HAD MFA GIN-UP AN INTERAGENCY PROCESS TO </p><p>CONSIDER THE GOI CORN BAN, THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE\'S </p><p>MISGUIDED WHITE PAPER, AND A POTENTIAL USG-GOI RESEARCH </p><p>ACCORD.  THE PM TOLD THE MINISTERS OF AGRICULTURE, HEALTH, </p><p>AND ENVIRONMENT TO GO INTO A CORNER AND WORK OUT THEIR </p><p>BIOTECH DIFFERENCES.  BIOTECH, AS IT TURNS OUT, WAS NOT A </p><p>MAJOR TOPIC OF DISCUSSION AT THE SUMMIT.  IN ITS AFTERMATH, </p><p>VARIOUS GOI CONTACTS ASSURE US THAT THEY HAVE HEARD OUR </p><p>COMPLAINTS AND THAT, AT A MINIMUM, SCIENCE WILL BE A MORE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF THE FORTHCOMING GOI AND PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>BIOTECH DEBATE.  IN DISCUSSIONS WITH VISITING EB ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY, SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS DISMISSED THE MOA WHITE PAPER </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AS MERELY ONE VIEWPOINT AND NOT EVEN AN OFFICIAL ONE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED.  PM BERLUSCONI SEEMS IN NO HURRY TO </p><p>CLARIFY THE STATE OF GOI BIOTECH POLICY.  SPEAKING BESIDE </p><p>ALEMANNO AT A JUNE 3 PRESS CONFERENCE, THE POLITICALLY NIMBLE </p><p>PM SAID ITALY SHOULD GO FORWARD ON BIOTECH RESEARCH "WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02765  01 OF 03  080706Z </p><p>MUCH CAUTION, BUT WITHOUT CLOSING THE DOOR TO TECHNICAL </p><p>PROGRESS AND WATCHING WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER COUNTRIES."  ONE </p><p>THING IS CERTAIN -- ALEMANNO\'S AGGRESSIVE COUNTDOWN TO </p><p>BIOTECH POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION IS ON HOLD.  HE </p><p>HAD HOPED TO SPARK PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE THIS MONTH.  NOW HE </p><p>SPEAKS BRAVELY OF HAVING A COHERENT GOI BIOTECH POLICY IN </p><p>PLACE BEFORE NEXT SPRING\'S PLANTING SEASON.  WE WILL KEEP THE </p><p>PRESSURE ON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) LOOKING TO REMOVE A POTENTIAL TRADE IRRITANT FROM </p><p>THE AGENDA FOR PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MAY 27-28 VISIT TO ROME, </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI HASTILY ORCHESTRATED OSTENSIBLE </p><p>MOVEMENT ON BIOTECH IN THE RUN-UP TO THE SUMMIT.  HE HAD THE </p><p>ITALIAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, NEVER MORE THAN </p><p>RELUCTANTLY ENGAGED ON THE ISSUE, CONVOKE AN INTERMINISTERIAL </p><p>PROCESS TO CONSIDER GOI BIOTECH POLICY AND, MORE </p><p>PARTICULARLY, TO REVIEW THE ITALIAN AUGUST 2000 BAN ON FOUR </p><p>BIOTECH CORN VARIETIES APPROVED BY THE EU, THE POLICY WHITE </p><p>PAPER LOOSELY AUTHORED BY THE AGRICULTURE MINISTRY, AND A </p><p>PROPOSED USG-GOI ACCORD ON BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH.  CALLS </p><p>FROM SEVERAL GOI OFFICIALS JUST BEFORE THE SUMMIT ASSURED </p><p>EMBOFFS THAT A MAY 22 MEETING OF THE MFA-LED AD HOC GROUP HAD </p><p>PRODUCED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PM THAT WOULD PLEASE US -- </p><p>CALLS TO REVOKE THE CORN BAN, DAMPEN THE WHITE PAPER, AND </p><p>PROCEED WITH THE BILATERAL ACCORD. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) BIOTECHNOLOGY WAS BRIEFLY MENTIONED DURING THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S 50 MINUTE BILATERAL MEETING WITH THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER WITH THE LEADERS AGREEING TO DEFER THE SUBJECT UNTIL </p><p>THE FOLLOW-ON DINNER.  OTHER BUSINESS, HOWEVER, ATE UP THE </p><p>TIME. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02765  01 OF 03  080706Z </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) VISITING EB ASSISTANT SECRETARY TONY WAYNE AND </p><p>ECONOFF MET WITH MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR EUROPE ROCCO </p><p>CANGELOSI AND PM DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR AND G-8 SHERPA GIOVANNI </p><p>CASTELLANETA ON MAY 30.  CANGELOSI HOSTED THE MAY 22 </p><p>INTERMINISTERIAL MEETING ON BIOTECH AND CASTELLANETA ACCEPTED </p><p>THE GROUP\'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PRIME MINISTER. </p><p>A/S WAYNE EXPRESSED TWO USG CONCERNS REGARDING GOI BIOTECH </p><p>POLICY: THE FAILURE OF THIS GOI TO REPEAL THE UNJUSTIFIED </p><p>CORN BAN ENACTED BY ITS PREDECESSOR AND THE STATUS OF THE </p><p>MOA\'S OVERTLY ANTI-BIOTECH WHITE PAPER AS THE DE FACTO CENTER </p><p>OF GOI BIOTECH DEBATE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) PERHAPS REFLECTING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE </p><p>HERETOFORE ATTACHED TO THE SUBJECT BY BERLUSCONI (WHO WEARS </p><p>BOTH THE PM AND FM HATS), CASTELLANETA AND CANGELOSI WERE </p><p>EACH WELL-VERSED ONLY ON NARROW AREAS OF THE BIOTECH DEBATE. </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE CORN BAN LACKS ANY GROUNDING IN </p><p>SCIENCE, CASTELLANETA SPOKE OF THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL </p><p>DIFFICULTY OF REPEALING IT.  HE REVEALED THAT BERLUSCONI HAS </p><p>ISSUED A HURRY-UP ORDER FOR A RECOMMENDATION FROM HIS CABINET </p><p>ON NEXT STEPS.  COMMENT.

THERE NEVER HAS BEEN ANY </p><p>SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR THE BAN.  END COMMENT.  CASTELLANETA </p><p>SAID BERLUSCONI HAS INSTRUCTED AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO </p><p>AND HEALTH MINISTER SIRCHIA TO ENGAGE ONE ANOTHER WITH A VIEW </p><p>TO FINDING COMMON GROUND ON THE CORN BAN AND BIOTECH POLICY </p><p>MORE GENERALLY.  LOOKING TO STRIKE A POSITIVE NOTE ON </p><p>BIOTECH, HE SAID THE PM\'S BIOTECHNOLOGY COMMISSION AND THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY ARE HOT TO INK A RESEARCH COOPERATION </p><p>ACCORD WITH THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) A/S WAYNE THANKED CANGELOSI FOR THE MFA\'S RECENT </p><p>EFFORT TO CONVOKE AN INTERMINISTERIAL PROCESS TO FOSTER A </p><p>BALANCED BIOTECH DISCUSSION.  NOTE.  THE GOI HAVING NO </p><p>INSTITUTIONALIZED INTERMINISTERIAL STRUCTURE, EFFORTS TO </p><p>BRING MINISTRIES TOGETHER ARE NECESSARILY AD HOC AND </p><p>LABOR-INTENSIVE.  END NOTE.  CANGELOSI SUMMARILY DISMISSED </p><p>THE WHITE PAPER AS AN UNSIGNED POSITION PAPER SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>DESIGNED TO STIMULATE DEBATE.  HE SAID THE PAPER HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>FORMALLY INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT AND DID NOT SEE ITS </p><p>INFORMAL CIRCULATION AS UNDULY INFLUENCING INTERMINISTERIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02765  02 OF 03  080756Z </p><p>DELIBERATIONS, WHICH HE SAID WOULD CONTINUE.  CANGELOSI\'S </p><p>DEPUTY, RITA MANNELLA, TOLD ECONOFF ON JUNE 6 THAT </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR ORGANIZING ANY FURTHER INTERMINISTERIAL </p><p>MEETINGS ON BIOTECH HAS BEEN SHIFTED TO THE PM\'S OFFICE AND </p><p>THAT NO FOLLOW-UP MEETING HAD BEEN SCHEDULED.  COMMENT. </p><p>ALTHOUGH WE WELCOME MFA\'S ENTRY INTO THE BIOTECH FRAY, </p><p>MANNELLA\'S COMMENTS CONFIRM THAT THE MINISTRY SEES ITSELF IN </p><p>A CAMEO ROLE.  PRIOR TO THE SUMMIT, SHE MADE CLEAR THAT MFA\'S </p><p>MANDATE FROM THE PM WAS TO DEFUSE THE BIOTECH ISSUE IN AN </p><p>EFFORT TO GET IT OFF THE VISIT AGENDA.  ABSENT FURTHER </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS FROM BERLUSCONI, MFA WILL BE LOOKING TO FADE </p><p>AWAY AGAIN RATHER THAN TO DEVELOP THE IN-HOUSE EXPERTISE </p><p>NECESSARY TO SHEPHERD AN ONGOING GOI BIOTECH DEBATE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) SINCE THE BIOTECH HICCUP BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL VISIT, THE AGRICULTURE MINISTRY HAS REASSERTED </p><p>ITSELF AS THE PRIMARY GOI ACTOR ON THE FILE, ALBEIT WITH </p><p>IMPORTANT CHANGES.  AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO HAD LONG </p><p>TARGETED A JUNE 4 MEETING OF THE "TAVOLO AGROALIMENTARE" (A </p><p>LOOSELY KNIT FORUM OF AGRICULTURE STAKEHOLDERS) FOR BRINGING </p><p>HIS WHITE PAPER ON BIOTECH POLICY OUT OF THE CLOSET. </p><p>(CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS REPORTED SEPTEL.)  INSTEAD, IN A JUNE </p><p>3 PRESS CONFERENCE HE REFERRED TO THE WHITE PAPER AS A WORK </p><p>IN PROGRESS, EXPRESSLY ALLOWING THAT  "WE WILL INCLUDE </p><p>PROPOSALS, IDEAS, AND EVERYTHING THAT CAN HELP CHECK GMO\'S </p><p>OUT SCIENTIFICALLY IN THE WHITE PAPER."   AT THE SAME PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE, ALEMANNO CALLED FOR A "MORATORIUM ON GMO\'S" BUT </p><p>EXPRESSLY QUALIFIED HIS OPPOSITION TO BIOTECH PRODUCTS AS </p><p>BASED "PRIMARILY ON ECONOMIC GROUNDS" (COMMENT. I.E., NOT ON </p><p>SCIENCE.  END COMMENT. ) AND INFLUENCED HEAVILY BY POLLS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02765  02 OF 03  080756Z </p><p>SHOWING THAT  "70 PERCENT OF (ITALIAN) CONSUMERS ARE AGAINST </p><p>THEIR USE." ALEMANNO SAID HE HOPES TO HAVE A POLICY PAPER TO </p><p>SUBMIT TO PARLIAMENT BY THE END OF THE SUMMER WITH A VIEW TO </p><p>ENACTMENT OF ITALIAN LEGISLATION BEFORE NEXT GROWING SEASON. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) APPEARING AT THE SAME PRESS CONFERENCE, PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI OFFERED WOBBLY GUIDANCE, SAYING "WE MUST UNDERTAKE </p><p>TO GO FORWARD WITH (GMO) RESEARCH, WITH MUCH PRUDENCE, BUT </p><p>WITHOUT CLOSING THE DOORS TO TECHNICAL PROGRESS AND WATCHING </p><p>WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER COUNTRIES."  COMMENT. WE KNOW OF NO </p><p>PRIVATE BERLUSCONI WORDS THAT CLARIFY HIS TERSE PUBLIC </p><p>COMMENT.  OUR GOI CONTACTS ARE TRYING TO PARSE THE ABOVE </p><p>SENTENCE FOR HIDDEN MEANING JUST AS WE ARE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  ALEMANNO\'S FAILURE TO LAUNCH HIS </p><p>TWICE RE-WRITTEN WHITE PAPER AS SCHEDULED IS WELCOME NEWS AND </p><p>A VALIDATION OF USG EFFORTS TO PRESSURE THE GOI TO CONDUCT A </p><p>SCIENCE-BASED DEBATE THAT WOULD INFORM PUBLIC OPINION RATHER </p><p>THAN MERELY REACT TO IT.  THE MINISTER CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS </p><p>THAT HIS EFFORT TO END-RUN ITALIAN SCIENTISTS AND THE GOI </p><p>STRAIGHT TO PARLIAMENT HAS FAILED.

COMMENT CONTINUED.  ALEMANNO\'S COUCHING OF HIS BIOTECH </p><p>OBJECTIONS IN ECONOMIC TERMS GREATLY RESTRICTS THE ARGUMENTS </p><p>AVAILABLE TO HIM.  HE HAS NEVER GIVEN INDICATION THAT HIS </p><p>GRASP OF ECONOMICS IS ANY BETTER THAN HIS GRASP OF SCIENCE. </p><p>WE KNOW OF NO STUDY, FOR EXAMPLE, SUPPORTING HIS VIEW THAT </p><p>OPENING THE ITALIAN MARKET TO BIOTECH PRODUCTS WOULD TAINT </p><p>THE IMAGE OF ITALIAN QUALITY PRODUCTS WITH RESULTANT ECONOMIC </p><p>HARM.  AT A MINIMUM, ALEMANNO HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO ALLOW THE </p><p>LEVEL OF DEBATE TO RISE FAR ABOVE THE SOPHISTRY OF THE </p><p>OUTSTANDING WHITE PAPER.  WE REALIZE THAT THE MINISTER IS NOT </p><p>ABOUT TO ABANDON HIS PURITY-OF-THE-MOTHERLAND AND TRADITIONAL </p><p>PRODUCTS RHETORIC IN FAVOR OF SUBSTANTIVE DEBATE, BUT HE IS </p><p>AT LEAST BEING FORCED TO LET OTHERS STAKEHOLDERS TALK.  WE </p><p>ANTICIPATE, GIVEN THAT ALEMANNO IS A PARTICULARLY ASTUTE </p><p>POLITICIAN, THAT WITH EVERY STEP FORWARD PRO-BIOTECH FORCES </p><p>ACHIEVE, THE MORE DEMAGOGIC AND RADICALIZED ALEMANNO\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02765  03 OF 03  080800Z </p><p>RHETORIC AND RESPONSE WILL BE.
