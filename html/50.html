(U) EFFORTS TO HALT THE DETERIORATION OF THE </p><p>SITUATION IN SOUTH LEBANON PREOCCUPIED LEBANESE </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL, POLITICAL, AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND.  ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS, FOLLOWING A MEETING ON MARCH 30, </p><p>PRESIDENT GEMAYEL, PRIME MINISTER KARAMI, AND </p><p>SENIOR LAF OFFICERS DECIDED TO REINFORCE LEBANESE </p><p>ARMY UNITS IN THE SOUTH, IN PART WITH EQUIPMENT </p><p>NOW BEING DELIVERED FROM THE U.S.  MINISTERS HOSS </p><p>AND BARRI, WHO TRAVELED TO DAMASCUS MARCH 31 TO </p><p>MEET WITH SARG VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM AND DRUZE </p><p>LEADER JUMBLATT, HAVE DEMANDED SUCH A </p><p>REINFORCEMENT OF LAF UNITS IN THE SOUTH FOR </p><p>SEVERAL WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) FOLLOWING THE MARCH 30 MEETING, PRIME </p><p>MINISTER KARAMI ACCUSED ISRAEL OF PROVOKING THE </p><p>VIOLENCE IN SIDON "IN THE HOPE OF OBTAINING A NEW </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION (ON A CONFESSIONAL </p><p>BASIS) AND EVENTUALLY ESTABLISHING A BUFFER ZONE </p><p>(ALONG THE BORDER STRIP)."  STATING THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN THE SOUTH MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE </p><p>REGIONAL CONTEXT, KARAMI SAID THAT THE GOL WOULD </p><p>UNDERTAKE CONTACTS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS WHICH </p><p>HAVE INFLUENCE IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) NOTING THAT "THE UNITED STATES IN </p><p>PARTICULAR CAN ACT TO CLEAN UP THE SITUATION," </p><p>KARAMI ADDED THAT THE GOL HAD NOT/NOT BEEN </p><p>INFORMED OF A VISIT TO LEBANON BY ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY MURPHY DURING THE LATTER\'S FORTHCOMING </p><p>TRIP TO THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  SHIITE AMAL LEADER NABIH BARRI DENOUNCED </p><p>THE INTENSIFICATION OF FIGHTING IN SIDON IN </p><p>ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WORDS AS KARAMI.  "ISRAEL," </p><p>HE SAID, "AIMS AT PROVOKING A NEW DEMOGRAPHIC </p><p>REDISTRIBUTION AND TO RESHAPE ITS FRONTIER WITH </p><p>LEBANON SO THAT THE CHRISTIANS IN SIDON AND JEZZIN </p><p>ARE MOVED TO THE BORDER ZONE AND THAT THE MUSLIMS, </p><p>MORE PRECISELY THE SHIITES, ARE FORCED BACK INTO </p><p>THE INTERIOR OF LEBANON."  "IT IS IN THIS </p><p>CONTEXT," BARRI ADDED, "THAT ONE CAN UNDERSTAND </p><p>THE RECENT EVENTS IN SIDON AND ORDERS WHICH WERE </p><p>GIVEN TO THE \'INTIFADA\' (I.E., JA\'JA\'S CHRISTIAN </p><p>DECISION MOVEMENT)..." </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) IN A MARCH 31 TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH </p><p>SARG PRESIDENT ASSAD, PRESIDENT GEMAYEL AGREED TO </p><p>RECEIVE A SYRIAN ENVOY TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN </p><p>SIDON AS WELL AS RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  SYRIAN MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CHIEF GENERAL KHOLI IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>MEET WITH GEMAYEL TODAY, APRIL 1. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) COMMENT.  THE CONTRADICTORY AND </p><p>TENDENTIOUS REPORTS REACHING BEIRUT ABOUT THE </p><p>FIGHTING IN SIDON ARE DIFFICULT TO UNRAVEL AND </p><p>EVALUATE.  PALESTINIAN UNITS DO APPEAR TO BE </p><p>TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN THE CLASHES.  IN SHORT, </p><p>THE SITUATION IN THE SOUTH APPEARS TO BE </p><p>DETERIORATING, AS EVERYONE HAD FEARED, INTO A </p><p>HEIGHTENED LEBANESE/ISRAELI CONFLICT AND BITTER </p><p>INTERCOMMUNAL CLASHES WITH PALESTINIAN </p><p>INVOLVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>LYNE </p><p></p></div>
