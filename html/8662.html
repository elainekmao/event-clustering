Dailies regard the </p><p>`warm\' letter by Powell as an indication of easing tensions </p><p>in U.S.-Turkey relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Armenians might demand compensation from Turkey: The </p><p>Assembly of Turkish-American Associations (ATAA) said that </p><p>some insurance policies given to Armenians during the </p><p>Ottoman period are currently being held by American and </p><p>French insurance companies, "Hurriyet" reports.  The </p><p>Governor of California, Gray Davis, has announced that he </p><p>believes the papers are still effective, and ATAA warns that </p><p>Turkey might be obliged to pay billions of dollars to </p><p>Armenians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. urges the EU to back Turkey: U.S. Special Cyprus </p><p>Coordinator Thomas Weston said at meetings with EU officials </p><p>Verheugen and Solana in Brussels on Tuesday that the EU </p><p>should extend support to the Turkish government\'s reform </p><p>efforts.  Weston also voiced support for the EU financial </p><p>aid package for Turkish Cypriots, and urged Ankara to exert </p><p>pressure on Denktas to continue with the UN-sponsored peace </p><p>plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraqi business delegation in SE Turkey: Mosul\'s Turkmen </p><p>deputy governor Ibrahim Arafat, accompanied by a 40-strong </p><p>delegation of Iraqi businessmen, paid a business visit to </p><p>Turkey\'s southeastern border town of Sirnak.  The Iraqi </p><p>delegation conveyed to Turkish officials and businessmen a </p><p>message of goodwill and cooperation from Mosul\'s Arab </p><p>governor, who has urged Turks to pursue increased levels of </p><p>bilateral trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TGS rejects  `harassment\' allegation: Dailies cite Greek </p><p>press reports claiming a vast increase in Turkish military </p><p>jets\' violation of Greek airspace.  The Greek defense </p><p>minister reportedly complained that dialogue with Turkish </p><p>politicians has produced no results because political </p><p>control in Turkey remains in the hands of the military.  A </p><p>TGS statement said on Tuesday that a military jet passing a </p><p>passenger plane at a ten kilometer distance cannot be </p><p>defined as harassment.  Dailies speculate that Athens is </p><p>playing a game to ensure that the Aegean dispute is carried </p><p>to the EU agenda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p>Middle East/US policy in the post war Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Where do we stand on the Pax Americana?" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna warned in the mass appeal-conservative Turkiye </p><p>(6/11): "Sometimes it is very hard for nations to comprehend </p><p>the realities of international politics, even though these </p><p>realities present themselves very clearly.  The `Pax </p><p>Americana\' is a reality of this century that will continue </p><p>to increase in importance because it has not yet been </p><p>concluded.  Take Syria, for example, which used to be </p><p>strongly anti-American.  Today, however, the Damascus regime </p><p>has completely changed its tune. . Eventually, both Saudi </p><p>Arabia and Syria will bow to US policies without the need </p><p>for a war.  There will inevitably be, however, a military </p><p>operation against Iran.  Yet Iran too will eventually </p><p>reconcile with the US.  After Iran, the US focus will be on </p><p>the Asian continent in an effort to expand the Pax </p><p>Americana.  It is worrying to see that many in Turkey keep </p><p>their heads under the sand and remain blind to world </p><p>realities." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yet another test for US-Turkey relations" </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever stated in mass appeal Hurriyet (6/11): </p><p>"Turkish-American relations are on the eve of another test. </p><p>The US will give Turkey a litmus test, especially on Iran, </p><p>Syria, and the Israel-Palestinian dispute in connection with </p><p>the American plan to reshape the Middle East region. . In </p><p>the US view, Iran and Syria have anti-American regimes that </p><p>incite terrorism.  There is still a chance to change both </p><p>regimes without the need for a military operation.  A new </p><p>order for the Middle East requires a lasting solution to the </p><p>Israel-Palestine issue. . Thus the visit of Undersecretary </p><p>Ziyal to Washington will take place at a very critical time, </p><p>especially for the future of Turkish-American relations. </p><p>The US is looking for a clear and precise stance from Turkey </p><p>with regard to Iran and Syria. . Turkey failed to pass the </p><p>credibility test before, and it remains to be seen what the </p><p>result will be this time." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
