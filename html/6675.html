<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, CASC, CVIS, EAIR, ECON, EWWT, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 8 (3/23 1600 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS GMP20030322000228 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  The GOJ this afternoon publicly announced (confirmed </p><p>by the Foreign Minister to the Ambassador) the expulsion of </p><p>five Iraqi diplomats "for security reasons and for performing </p><p>actions that contradict the nature of their work as </p><p>diplomats".  The Minister said they would be asked to leave </p><p>the country. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Embassy resumed many public services today, </p><p>although activities at ancillary facilities (the American </p><p>Language Center, Peace Corps office) remain suspended. </p><p>American personnel were encouraged to stagger their arrival </p><p>and departure to/from work and, although standfast has been </p><p>lifted, are limited to essential movements. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The vast majority of Jordanians remain angry, </p><p>frustrated and completely unconvinced by the U.S. rationale </p><p>for war.  Although the GOJ continues to keep a tight lid on </p><p>public displays of opposition to the war (allowing some </p><p>demonstrations but always with a large security presence), </p><p>private conversations with Jordanians reveal an unprecedented </p><p>level of anger with both the U.S. and with Arab leaders who </p><p>are seen as abetting a new "colonization of Arab lands." </p><p>Many contacts described the King\'s 3/21 speech to the nation </p><p>(and his subsequent comments on 3/22 (see below)), in largely </p><p>negative, dismissive and derogatory terms. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As of 1200 noon local time, PSD reports that a number </p><p>of student demonstrations are currently ongoing at several </p><p>Jordanian universities.  These include 3,000 at Jordan </p><p>University for Science and Technology in Irbid, 1,000 at </p><p>al-Yarmouk University in Irbid, and several hundred each at </p><p>universities in Ma\'an and on the outskirts of Amman. PSD </p><p>personnel are present at all these sites and report that the </p><p>gatherings have been peaceful.  Intermittent demonstrations </p><p>by groups of youths at the Baqa\'a refugee camp continue today </p><p>as well. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Jordanian press reported today on the return of </p><p>the body of the Jordanian taxi driver allegedly killed on the </p><p>road from Baghdad near Ramadi by a coalition missile.  The </p><p>press also reported today that four Jordanians were killed in </p><p>a car accident near Mosul, although rumors abound </p><p>(particularly via mobile phone text messages and a story on </p><p>al-Jazeera TV) that they too were hit by U.S. ordnance.  The </p><p>MFA confirmed that four Jordanians had died near Mosul, but </p><p>did not have specific information on the circumstances of the </p><p>incident. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Financial markets continue to take events in stride. </p><p>The Amman Stock Exchange recorded a 1 percent gain Sunday. </p><p>Queen Alia International Airport continues to operate </p><p>normally.  Alitalia resumed its Amman service, joining Air </p><p>France, which restored its service yesterday.  Other European </p><p>carriers are assessing security and market conditions before </p><p>they restore service to Amman.  KLM has indicated it will not </p><p>resume operations before April 14. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Port of Aqaba authorities said "business as usual" </p><p>continues at the port.  Officials said that none of the big </p><p>shipping lines have indicated reductions or cancellations in </p><p>calls or loads.  However, Ministry of Transportation, </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and shipping associations are </p><p>working with international insurance companies to ensure that </p><p>Aqaba is not designated as part of the war zone.  Inclusion </p><p>in the war zone could translate into additional insurance </p><p>costs of up to USD 4000 per ship and up to USD 150-250 per </p><p>container. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  No new issues.  Consular inquiries remain light. </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Petra news service reported that, in a March 22 </p><p>cabinet meeting, King Abdullah stressed the importance of </p><p>maintaining domestic security and stability in the current </p><p>crisis.  He added that any expressions of anger should be </p><p>non-violent.  Also in the cabinet meeting, PM Abul Ragheb </p><p>said the government had taken measures to mitigate the impact </p><p>of the war on sensitive economic sectors including tourism, </p><p>transport and exports.  Abul Ragheb noted Jordan\'s monetary </p><p>situation is stable, with foreign currency reserves remaining </p><p>high. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  No new issues.  GOJ protection of the chancery </p><p>compound remains at a heightened state. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  As of 1200 noon, IOM reports that a total of 651 </p><p>TCNs have crossed into Jordan from Iraq since the beginning </p><p>of hostilities (51 overnight). IOM continues to evacuate </p><p>TCNs.  All Sudanese who had previously said that they wanted </p><p>to claim asylum have now agreed to return to Sudan.  IOM </p><p>continues to organize their departure via charter and </p><p>commercial flights.  Currently 291 TCNs remain in the </p><p>Ruweished transit camp.  No Iraqi asylum seekers have yet </p><p>tried to enter Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) CNN reporters who were expelled by the Iraqi </p><p>authorities and arrived at Ruweished on 3/22 told UNHCR that </p><p>the Iraqi side of the border is open, the road from Baghdad </p><p>to the Jordanian border remains clear, they did not see </p><p>anything that could prevent Iraqis from leaving the country, </p><p>and that they did not come across any population movements </p><p>along the road.  TCNs, however, report rumors of missile </p><p>strikes on vehicles attempting to transit the Baghdad-Amman </p><p>highway.  However, a group of South Africans who made the </p><p>journey late on 3/22 corroborated the account of the CNN team </p><p>that they saw no evidence of injured civilians or blockages </p><p>along the road. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) UNHCR also reports that the GOJ has restricted access </p><p>to all points east of Safawiye and had turned back UN </p><p>officials who lacked proper documentation.  UNHCR reports </p><p>also that a zone 5 KM from the Iraqi-Jordanian border is now </p><p>officially off-limits to journalists. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Local Arabic press coverage continues to focus on the </p><p>bravery and resistance of Iraqi troops, along with pictures </p><p>of civilian casualties, rather than the speed and might of </p><p>the U.S. military.  Cartoonists depict scenes such as </p><p>President Bush tossing a bomb out of a plane and saying </p><p>"Here, have a little more Democracy."  The Arabic daily </p><p>Al-Dustour ran a gruesome above-the-fold front page color </p><p>photo of an Iraqi child allegedly killed by coalition </p><p>bombing.  Editorialists vary between articles hailing King </p><p>Abdullah\'s determination to end the war as soon as possible </p><p>and protect Jordan\'s interests, and a mantra that the war is </p><p>being waged by the Zionist lobby and oil interests. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
