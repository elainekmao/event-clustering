PFLAUMER </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WIN DAYTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI TALKS ABOUT MASS ACTION, REGIONAL </p><p>INITIATIVES, LEGAL WOES, AND TRANSITIONAL PERIOD NEEDS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER KIMBERLY JEMISON FOR REASONS 1.5 C/D </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) At a meeting on May 28, 2003, MDC leader Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai and MDC deputy Secretary General Gift Chimanikire </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>discussed the impending mass action, the status of the </p><p>Mbeki-Muluzi-Obasanjo initiative, the court cases, and </p><p>transitional period needs.  Tsvangirai seemed confident that </p><p>the June mass action would be both non-violent and controlled </p><p>and would push ZANU-PF hardliners closer to the negotiating </p><p>table.  He seemed less optimistic about the success of the </p><p>regional initiative to get ZANU-PF and MDC talking and the </p><p>likelihood of the judge granting an acquittal in his treason </p><p>case.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>MASS ACTION </p><p>----------- </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador, AF/S Director Scott DeLisi, and PolOff </p><p>met MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and MDC deputy Secretary </p><p>General Gift Chimanikire on May 28,2003, a day after </p><p>Tsvangirai briefed G8 representatives on the MDC,s position </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>vis--vis various current issues, including plans for mass </p><p>action (See Reftel).  Tsvangirai said there has been a </p><p>progressive frustration and anger among the Zimbabwean people </p><p>and he expected a high level of participation in the mass </p><p>action.  When asked what form the mass action would take, he </p><p>said he had asked MDC supporters whether they preferred a </p><p>stayaway or demonstration.  He said the overwhelming majority </p><p>preferred the demonstration option.  Tsvangirai told us the </p><p>MDC leadership had been preaching non-violence in preparation </p><p>for the demonstration and believed it would be able to </p><p>control the crowds.  Both the Ambassador and DeLisi </p><p>reiterated the U.S. position that demonstrations should be </p><p>non-violent and every precaution should be undertaken to </p><p>ensure they remain non-violent. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In spite of this confidence in being able to control </p><p>the crowds, Tsvangirai expressed concern about the youth </p><p>getting out of control, particularly if the war veterans </p><p>decide to take on the demonstrators.  Ironically, Tsvangirai </p><p>was also concerned that if the police and/or military did not </p><p>react to the demonstrations with force, the marchers would </p><p>feel emboldened and expand the scope of activities and get </p><p>out of control. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) When asked where the demonstrations were likely to </p><p>take place--city center or high-density suburbs--Tsvangirai </p><p>said the city center was an option.  He said a march on State </p><p>House was not planned.  Both he and Chimanikire seemed to </p><p>believe the police and military (and most likely the MDC </p><p>youth) would be less likely to behave in an unruly fashion or </p><p>destroy the infrastructure in the city center than if they </p><p>were in the high-density areas. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a separate conversation May 28, Gibson Sibanda, </p><p>Vice-President of the MDC, told the Ambassador that the MDC </p><p>was doing all in its power to keep its supporters under </p><p>control.  MDC marshals will attend each rally and leaders at </p><p>each event will remind people to remain peaceful.  The MDC </p><p>does believe that the war veterans have been issued weapons </p><p>and are planning to run an ad asking them not to interfere. </p><p>(NOTE: In the past, rumors that war veterans were being armed </p><p>have been false. END NOTE.)  Sibanda said the MDC was also </p><p>planning to be on the lookout for potential infiltrators </p><p>hoping to stir up trouble. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>REGIONAL INITIATIVE ON HOLD </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) Turning to the regional initiative and his meeting </p><p>with Malawian President Bakili Muluzi, Tsvangirai said the </p><p>planned meeting had to be cancelled because he needed to </p><p>apply to the court to travel to Malawi and knew he would </p><p>never get approval.  Tsvangirai also claimed that Mugabe </p><p>expressed reservations about him going out of the country and </p><p>was suspicious of the host,s and invitee,s intentions. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Tsvangirai commented that Mugabe met with Mozambican </p><p>President Joachim Chisamo, Muluzi, South African President </p><p>Thabo Mbeki, and other regional foreign ministers and heads </p><p>of state at the Walter Sisulu funeral to discuss ways to </p><p>resolve the Zimbabwe crisis.  According to Tsvangirai, these </p><p>leaders were disappointed with the outcome because Mugabe was </p><p>not willing to negotiate and offered no suggestions on how to </p><p>resolve the situation.  As a result of the meeting, the </p><p>regional initiative is on hold.  In spite of the failed </p><p>talks, Tsvangirai feels it is important the region keep up </p><p>the momentum and pressure on Mugabe.  Both the Ambassador and </p><p>DeLisi commented that it might be necessary to regenerate the </p><p>momentum first. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>COURT CASES </p><p>----------- </p><p>8. (C) Regarding the treason trial, Tsvangirai thought the </p><p>prosecution would wrap up its case in two or three weeks.  He </p><p>said the MDC attorneys were planning to apply for an </p><p>acquittal.  He said if the judge grants the acquittal then </p><p>the trial is over but the judge may decide he wants to hear </p><p>all the evidence before making a decision.  In that case, the </p><p>defendants would most likely take the stand. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Tsvangirai said the election challenge was on hold for </p><p>two reasons.  One, the MDC was trying to get another judge to </p><p>preside over the case.  At the moment, Garwe, the judge who </p><p>is presiding over the treason trial, is slated to hear </p><p>arguments.  Two, Mugabe has said in a defense filing the </p><p>trial is not an emergency, hence, it will not be tried soon. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>TRANSITION </p><p>---------- </p><p>10. (C) The Ambassador remarked that the U.S. was interested </p><p>in Zimbabwe\'s needs during a transition phase.  He asked </p><p>Tsvangirai for recommendations for support.  Tsvangirai </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>responded that energy and food needs would be paramount but </p><p>it would take at least two years before the agricultural </p><p>sector would be up to par.  He revealed that the MDC is </p><p>finalizing a recovery economic plan, which he would make </p><p>available to the Embassy upon its completion in the first </p><p>week of June. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Prior to the Ambassador,s specific questions on </p><p>transition, Tsvangirai identified immediate changes that </p><p>would need to occur if Mugabe were to step down.  He said the </p><p>parties would need to agree on a transition strategy, be it </p><p>what is already described in the Constitution or something </p><p>new.  He thought ZANU-PF would like a shorter transition </p><p>period before elections while MDC would like a longer period </p><p>in order to build confidence in the process.  Whatever the </p><p>method, Tsvangirai maintained that before any new elections, </p><p>the militias would have to be dissolved in order to minimize </p><p>the possibility of violence and Parliament would need to </p><p>repeal repressive legislation, such as the Public Order and </p><p>Security Act and the Access to Information and Protection of </p><p>Privacy Act, and amend the Electoral Act to allow for </p><p>independent and terror-free election education and </p><p>campaigning.  (COMMENT: Tsvangirai, in effect, confirmed that </p><p>his new public position against a transitional authority is </p><p>merely a negotiating ploy to respond to hardened ZANU-PF </p><p>public positions.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>12.  (C) After weeks of speculation, it seems that the MDC is </p><p>finally ready to move to the next stage in its campaign to </p><p>force change.  The party leadership,s confidence in a </p><p>successful mass action, the increased regional interest in </p><p>resolving the crisis in Zimbabwe, and the belief that the </p><p>treason trial may result in an acquittal, seem to have </p><p>bolstered the confidence of the party.  Nonetheless, there </p><p>are two serious risks here--the risk that the public will not </p><p>turn out in the face of government threats and the risk that </p><p>the confrontation between MDC demonstrators and government </p><p>security forces will result in serious violence and massive </p><p>arrests, including of MDC leaders--that jeopardize the </p><p>efficacy of the mass action.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
