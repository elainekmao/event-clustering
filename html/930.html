<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 002617 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  COPY (PARAGRAPH MARKINGS) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  04/06/03 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN TESTS "GHAURI" MISSILE </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  CLASSIFIED BY CDA ALAN EASTHAM, 1.5D. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMAD SUMMONED P-5 CHIEFS </p><p>OF MISSION ON A HALF-HOUR\'S NOTICE APRIL 6 TO INFORM US OF THE </p><p>"SUCCESSFUL TEST" OF THE "INDIGENOUS" GHAURI MISSILE, WHICH HE SAID </p><p>HAD A 1,500 KM RANGE FOR A 700 KG PAYLOAD.  HALF HIS PRESENTATION </p><p>WAS ON THE MISSILE; THE OTHER HALF WAS AN INDIA-CENTRIC </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR MISSILE TESTING.  CHARGE\' OFFERED AN INFORMAL </p><p>IMMEDIATE REACTION IN PRIVATE, NOTING THAT THE TEST WAS </p><p>INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUGGESTION FOR RESTRAINT MADE IN THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE\'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMAD CALLED IN THE AMBASSADORS </p><p>OF RUSSIA, U.K. AND FRANCE AND THE CHINESE AND AMERICAN CHARGES ON </p><p>APRIL 6.  FOLLOWING IS A DIGEST OF HIS PRESENTATION: </p><p> </p><p>--  I HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME TO INFORM YOU THAT AS A PART OF </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S INTEGRATED MISSILE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, </p><p>TODAY WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY FLIGHT-TESTED THE SURFACE-TO-SURFACE </p><p>"GHAURI" MISSILE IN THE HATF SERIES.  (COMMENT: AN ACCOMPANYING </p><p>PRESS RELEASE CALLS THIS MISSILE THE "HATF-FIVE" (ROMAN NUMERAL </p><p>HATF-V). </p><p> </p><p>--  THIS MISSILE HAS A RANGE OF 1,500 KM AND A PAYLOAD OF 700KG. </p><p> </p><p>--  THIS TEST REPRESENTS A STEP FORWARD IN OUR INDIGENOUS MISSILE </p><p>AND SATELLITE LAUNCH PROGRAMS.  WE HAVE ACHIEVED THIS INDIGENOUS </p><p>CAPABILITY THROUGH THE COMMITMENT OF PAKISTANI SCIENTISTS AND </p><p>ENGINEERS. </p><p> </p><p>--  WE DO NOT HAVE TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY REGARDING INDIAN FLIGHT </p><p>TESTS.  INDIA HAS CONDUCTED 16 TESTS OF THE PAKISTAN-SPECIFIC </p><p>PRITHVI MISSILE AND HAS ALREADY DEPLOYED IT ALONG OUR BORDERS. </p><p>INDIA HAS ALSO TESTED THE AGNI MISSILE FOUR TIMES. </p><p> </p><p>--  IN SPITE OF THE INDIAN PROVOCATIVE TESTS IN THEIR NUCLEAR AND </p><p>BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE EXERCISED EXTREME RESTRAINT. </p><p>BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT ABOUT PAKISTAN\'S SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>--  LET ME REITERATE THAT PAKISTAN WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW RESTRAINT. </p><p>WE DO NOT WANT TO SPARK A NUCLEAR AND MISSILE ARMS RACE IN SOUTH </p><p>ASIA. </p><p> </p><p>--  WE HAVE ALREADY MADE FORMAL PROPOSALS TO INDIA FOR MUTUAL AND </p><p>EQUITABLE RESTRAINT IN THE NUCLEAR AND MISSILE AREA WITHOUT </p><p>RECEIVING ANY RESPONSE.  WE ARE PREPARED TO ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITH INDIA ON NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC MISSILE ISSUES AS AN INTEGRAL </p><p>PART OF OUR BILATERAL DIALOGUE, WHICH AS YOU KNOW REMAINS </p><p>STALEMATED BECAUSE OF PROCEDURAL DIFFICULTIES. </p><p> </p><p>--  ON OUR PART WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO OVERCOME THESE PROCEDURAL </p><p>DIFFICULTIES;  WE HOPE WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME IN THE NEAR </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER ASKED WHERE THE TEST HAD </p><p>BEEN CARRIED OUT; THE FS SAID "IN PAKISTAN, ON LAND."  SUBSEQUENT </p><p>QUESTIONS FROM THE GROUP REVOLVED AROUND THE DIALOGUE WITH INDIA, </p><p>WITH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY OFFERING NOTHING NEW.  ACCOMPANYING </p><p>PRESS RELEASE (FAXED TO SA/PAB) ADDS NOTHING TO WHAT IS REPORTED </p><p>ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  FOLLOWING THE GROUP SESSION, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY ASKED </p><p>TO SEE CHARGE\' PRIVATELY TO DISCUSS ANOTHER MATTER.  IN HIS OFFICE, </p><p>CHARGE\' SAID THAT NEWS OF THIS TEST MAY BE TAKEN BADLY IN </p><p>WASHINGTON, SINCE IT DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE\'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  THE </p><p>U.S. BELIEVES THE DECISION TO TEST A NEW MISSILE COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>POSTPONED IN ORDER TO LET THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT ESTABLISH </p><p>ITSELF.  HOW THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT WILL REACT IS UNPREDICTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE FOREIGN SECRETARY RESPONDED BY REITERATING THE POINTS </p><p>CITED ABOVE ON INDIAN TESTS, ADDING THAT "NO ONE EVER SAID </p><p>ANYTHING" ABOUT INDIAN MISSILE TESTING. CHARGE\' SAID THAT OF COURSE </p><p>IT WAS UP TO PAKISTAN HOW PAKISTAN TOOK CARE OF ITS OWN SECURITY, </p><p>BUT FROM HIS RECOLLECTION IT HAD BEEN SEVERAL YEARS SINCE THE </p><p>INDIANS HAD COMPLETED THE "TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION" PHASE OF AGNI </p><p>TESTING.  THE DIFFICULTY OF MISSILE SYSTEMS WAS THEIR DESTABILIZING </p><p>EFFECT IN TIMES OF TENSION.  ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TARIQ ALTAF </p><p>QUICKLY ADDED THAT THE BJP PLATFORM CALLED FOR "INDUCTING" NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS TO INDIA\'S FORCES, A POINT WHICH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY </p><p>QUICKLY ENDORSED.  CHARGE\' CLOSED THE SESSION BY SAYING THAT AS THE </p><p>SECRETARY HAD SUGGESTED IN HER LETTER AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD </p><p>ACCEPTED IN HIS REPLY, THIS WOULD CERTAINLY BE A SUBJECT FOR </p><p>DISCUSSION DURING THE VISIT OF AMBASSADORS RICHARDSON AND </p><p>INDERFURTH AND MR. RIEDEL. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD USE AMBASSADOR </p><p>KHOKHAR\'S CALL ON ASSISTANT SECRETARY INDERFURTH TODAY TO CONVEY </p><p>MORE FORMAL REGRETS ABOUT PAKISTAN\'S DECISION TO TEST THIS MISSILE, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE SECRETARY\'S LETTER SPECIFICALLY </p><p>REQUESTING RESTRAINT IN MISSILE TESTING.  (FYI, WE HAD A SUGGESTION </p><p>FROM ANOTHER SENIOR PAKISTANI OVER THE WEEKEND THAT SOME AT LEAST </p><p>THINK PAKISTAN DID EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN NOT TESTING BEFORE MARCH </p><p>23 AND IN NOT DISPLAYING THE MISSILE THAT DAY DURING THE PAKISTAN </p><p>DAY PARADE.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) NOTE ALSO THAT THIS IS DESCRIBED AS A "FLIGHT TEST," AND </p><p>NOT/NOT AS INDUCTION OF THE MISSILE INTO PAKISTAN\'S ARMED FORCES. </p><p>THE PAKISTANIS VIEW THIS AS CATCHING UP TO THE INDIANS, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO AGNI, AND NOT AS LEAPFROGGING THEIR </p><p>MISSILE CAPABILITIES.   THE TIMING IS CLEARLY RELATED TO THE </p><p>ARRIVAL OF THE BJP GOVERNMENT IN INDIA AND EXTREME PAKISTANI </p><p>NERVOUSNESS ABOUT BJP PRONOUNCEMENTS IN THE NUCLEAR AREA, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY THE DECLARATIONS OF THE INTENTION TO "INDUCT" NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS.  THE PAKISTANIS DECIDED TO LAY DOWN A FIRM MARKER BOTH TO </p><p>THE INDIANS AND THE PAKISTANI PUBLIC THAT PAKISTANI CAPABILITIES IN </p><p>THIS FIELD ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT.  THIS TEST WILL PRESENT THE BJP- </p><p>LED GOVERNMENT IN INDIA WITH A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN THE </p><p>SECURITY FIELD AT THE MOMENT IT IS ESTABLISHING ITSELF IN DELHI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EASTHAM </p><p></p></div>
