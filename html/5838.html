<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000202 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: RELIGIOUS MINORITIES APPREHENSIVE OF LATEST </p><p>FOUNDATION REGULATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ANKARA 8881 </p><p>     B. 02 ANKARA 7290 </p><p>     C. 02 ANKARA 6116 </p><p>     D. 02 STATE 44732 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL DAVID ARNETT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The General Directorate for Foundations </p><p>recently enacted regulations that were expected to allow </p><p>community (i.e. non-Muslim religious) foundations to reclaim </p><p>seized properties.  The new regulations are part of the </p><p>EU-harmonization reforms aimed at enhancing religious </p><p>minority rights and, it was hoped, allowing foundations to </p><p>reclaim seized properties.  Reaction from non-Muslim </p><p>community leaders ranged from outrage to indifference to </p><p>near-contentment, depending upon a community\'s reading of the </p><p>regulations and the amount of each community\'s disputed </p><p>property.  However, one fact is unquestioned: property </p><p>acquisition and registration remains squarely in the </p><p>unsupervised hands of the General Directorate for </p><p>Foundations, the very body accused of appropriating many of </p><p>the properties to begin with.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE NEW REGULATIONS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The new regulations, published in the Official </p><p>Gazette January 24, address three different issues: how </p><p>community foundations can acquire property, how they may use </p><p>such property, and how they may register "property already at </p><p>their disposal" (i.e. occupied but unregistered property). </p><p>Each portion of the regulation has its own ambiguities and </p><p>legal complexities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In the case of acquisition, it is unclear whether </p><p>newer religious community foundations, not currently on the </p><p>list, will be allowed to acquire further property as their </p><p>community grows.  In the case of older communities with </p><p>shrinking populations, it is not clear if they will have the </p><p>option of acquiring new properties at all, as they will have </p><p>to explain, even if the property is willed or donated, what </p><p>"religious, charitable, social, educational, cultural, and </p><p>health needs" the new property will meet.  The Ecumenical </p><p>Patriarchate and other communities with rapidly dwindling </p><p>populations fear that the General Directorate for </p><p>Foundations, the arbiter of whether the property may be </p><p>acquired, will deny them the inheritance, saying their needs </p><p>are already met by current properties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In the case of disposition of property already owned </p><p>and properly registered, the foundations are allowed to </p><p>"exercise their power of disposition of the property" in </p><p>order to meet the needs listed above.  However, "the exercise </p><p>of real rights shall be subject to the permission of the </p><p>General Directorate for Foundations."  Thus, rental or sale </p><p>of an existing property is not an unsupervised right. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In the case of registration of currently owned </p><p>property, the regulation seems to preclude the possibility of </p><p>restitution for properties seized by the GoT between 1935 and </p><p>the present.  Though the regulation is generous as to what </p><p>documents can be used to buttress an application for </p><p>registration (including utility bills, Ottoman deeds and </p><p>registries, and unapproved deed inspection records), the </p><p>caveat that the property must be "under the disposal of the </p><p>foundation" suggests that only property with documentation </p><p>problems, rather than property expropriated by the State, </p><p>will be covered under the law.  Thus, one major point it was </p><p>hoped the new law would ameliorate is not addressed by the </p><p>regulation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>GENERAL REACTIONS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  Poloff spoke with representatives of all major </p><p>communities affected by the new regulations (the Ecumenical </p><p>Patriarchate, Armenian Orthodox Patriarchate, Suriyani </p><p>Orthodox Metropolitan, Jewish Community, and Chaldean </p><p>Catholics).  Since the law is written specifically for </p><p>community foundations, the list of relevant groups was </p><p>appended to the regulation, though there is no mention of </p><p>what inclusion on the list of 160 foundations means.  Whether </p><p>or not these are the only parties who can make use of the law </p><p>is unclear.  The portion of the law related to registration </p><p>of currently owned property covers the years 1935 to present </p><p>(and the list of foundations is roughly accurate for those </p><p>registered in 1936).  However, it is unclear if newer </p><p>foundations, such as the Istanbul Protestant Church </p><p>Foundation, can make use of the new "acquisition" regulations </p><p>or not, as they were not listed in the appendix. </p><p>7. (U) Of the total 160 foundations listed, the Ecumenical </p><p>Patriarchate has 74.  The Armenian Orthodox Patriarchate has </p><p>34 foundations.  The Jewish Community has 18, Suriyanis 6, </p><p>and Chaldean Catholics 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Reactions to the regulation diverge widely. </p><p>Metropolitan Meliton of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, who has </p><p>principal responsibility for property issues, argues the </p><p>regulations are "one step forward, three steps back," in that </p><p>they fail to recognize or give status to the Patriarchate, </p><p>split Halki into two foundations, and make no provision for </p><p>the re-acquisition of expropriated property.  Armenian </p><p>Orthodox, Suriyani and Chaldean Catholic churches are also </p><p>pessimistic about the regulations\' limitations to varying </p><p>degrees, but suggest that the law may open some possibilities </p><p>for normalization of unresolved property problems and new </p><p>property acquisition.  Finally, the Jewish Community is most </p><p>optimistic, seeing no new problems created by the law, and </p><p>some utility in the registration process.  Except for the </p><p>Armenians and Greeks, all the communities with which post met </p><p>agreed that the appended foundation list was complete. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>SPECIFIC CONCERNS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) "A Patriarch is not a Foundation": Greek and Armenian </p><p>Orthodox churches hold that their patriarchs, and the </p><p>immediate facilities in which they reside and work, are not </p><p>foundations, but simply patriarchates.  As such, they should </p><p>be allowed to own and acquire property, as well as register </p><p>the property they now inhabit, in their own right (in both </p><p>cases, the patriarchates do not have any legal status or </p><p>deed, despite centuries of residence).  Unlike the </p><p>Hahamhanesi (Chief Rabbinate), they have no established </p><p>foundation for the patriarchate itself, and argue that a </p><p>foundation is unacceptable because the patriarch alone </p><p>decides how the property should be administered, not a </p><p>committee (as is required in the law governing foundations). </p><p>This political and semantic fight prevents both parties from </p><p>coming to a modus vivendi with the GoT under the new </p><p>regulations, and continues a decades-old stand-off over what, </p><p>exactly, a patriarch is under Turkish law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) "Applying to the Thief": Greek and Armenian Orthodox </p><p>and Chaldean Catholic churches all see restitution of </p><p>expropriated property as impossible under this law.  Legal </p><p>problems "created" (in their terms) by the GoT in the </p><p>thirties prevented non-Muslim communities from either </p><p>registering properties or forming their own foundations. </p><p>Accordingly, over the course of the next 60 years, their </p><p>properties were taken over by the General Directorate of </p><p>Foundations.  No mention is made in the regulation of how to </p><p>apply for restitution of properties which were seized, only </p><p>how to register properties which are still in the </p><p>communities\' possession, but lack proper documentation. </p><p>Though all concede that the law technically could be </p><p>interpreted to allow for some form of restitution, such an </p><p>application must be approved by the General Directorate for </p><p>Foundations, the very body which took the properties to begin </p><p>with.  In the words of Fr. Francois Yakan of the Chaldean </p><p>Catholic Church, "that would be like applying to the thief to </p><p>get your wallet back." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The regulations fall well short of providing a </p><p>transparent and efficient means to reconcile property </p><p>seizures that the GoT itself recognizes were unlawful. </p><p>Normalization of the status of property already in the hands </p><p>of the foundations demands a willingness on the part of the </p><p>foundation to accommodate to the General Directorate\'s </p><p>willful interpretations of the law.  The Jewish Community </p><p>long ago elected to accommodate itself.  The Greek and </p><p>Armenian Orthodox churches continue to hold their political </p><p>ground in the interests of establishing a transparent and </p><p>reliable approach on the part of the General Directorate. </p><p>End comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
