SUMMARY:  THE WAR IN IRAQ, IRAQI CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, AND </p><p>U.S. PLANS FOR POST-WAR IRAQ DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA. </p><p>"AL KHALEEJ" AND "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALS CRITICIZED AMERICAN AND </p><p>BRITISH TROOPS TREATMENT OF CIVILIANS IN IRAQ.  IN AN "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" OP-ED, ABDULLAH RASHEED LAMBASTED ARAB SATELLITE TV </p><p>CHANNELS FOR THEIR "STUPID" COVERAGE AND MANIPULATION AT THE </p><p>HANDS OF THE IRAQI REGIME.  UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN BLASTED </p><p>U.S. ACTIONS AND POST-WAR PLANS FOR IRAQ IN "AL BAYAN."  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "INNOCENT BLOOD," DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS- </p><p>ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 4/02: </p><p> </p><p>"THE CURRENT WAR AGAINST IRAQ HAS ENTERED A GRAVE STAGE ... WE </p><p>ARE CONTENT WITH THE REMARKS MADE BY TWO BRITISH SOLDIERS WHO RAN </p><p>AWAY FROM THE BATTLES IN IRAQ.  THEY ASSERTED THEIR DISAPPROVAL </p><p>IN TAKING PART IN THIS \'DIRTY\' WAR AIMED AT KILLING INNOCENT </p><p>CIVILIANS." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN IRAQ, SHARJAH-BASED </p><p>PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 4/02: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE APOLOGIES ANNOUNCED BY BRITISH AND AMERICAN OFFICIALS </p><p>ARE SIMILAR TO KILLING SOMEONE AND LATER TAKING PART IN HIS </p><p>FUNERAL, ESPECIALLY WHEN EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE IS WRONG, </p><p>AND WHAT IRAQ HAS BEEN FACING SINCE MARCH 20TH IS A SCANDAL AND A </p><p>CRIME AT THE SAME TIME ... EVERY DAY THAT PASSES CARRIES WITH IT </p><p>MORE SCANDALS AND CRIMES." </p><p> </p><p>4.  CRITICIZING ARAB SATELLITE TV CHANNELS, UAE COLUMNIST ABDULLA </p><p>RASHEED WROTE IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" ON </p><p>4/02: </p><p> </p><p>"... SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF THE WAR, SADDAM AND HIS REGIME, WHO </p><p>HAVE BEEN SHOWING THEIR MUSCLE ON THESE STUPID (ARAB) SATELLITE </p><p>CHANNELS, ARE LIVING UNDERGROUND IN BUNKERS THAT CAN RESIST AND </p><p>SURVIVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ... THE BEST THING THESE STUPID SATELLITE </p><p>STATIONS CAN DO FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE IS TO SHUT DOWN.  OUR </p><p>DISGUST FOR YOU HAS BECOME UNSPEAKABLE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  DISPARAGING THE IRAQI OPPOSITION, UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN </p><p>WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" ON 4/02: </p><p> </p><p>"... SO THE IRAQI PEOPLE, NOT THE IRAQI OPPOSITION, WILL RESIST </p><p>THE INVADERS IF THEY THINK OF OCCUPYING IRAQ!  SO WHAT ARE THE </p><p>AMERICANS DOING IN IRAQ NOW?  AREN\'T THEY OCCUPYING IT RIGHT IN </p><p>FRONT OF THE EYES OF THE WHOLE WORLD, AREN\'T THEY DESTROYING IT </p><p>IN ORDER TO REBUILD IT, AND THEREFORE DOUBLE THEIR PROFIT?  THE </p><p>ESTIMATED COST OF THE WAR AS GRANTED BY CONGRESS IS 75 BILLION </p><p>DOLLARS, MONEY LATER TO BE TAKEN FROM IRAQI OIL REVENUES.  IRAQ </p><p>IS BEING DESTROYED BY THE AMERICANS, AND LATER ON, ALL THE </p><p>REBUILDING CONTRACTS FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WILL BE GIVEN TO </p><p>TEXAS COMPANIES ... BRITISH AND AMERICANS ARE DIVIDING IRAQ:  ITS </p><p>LAND, OIL, AND MONEY.  THEY ARE ALSO DIVIDING THE KILLING OF </p><p>IRAQIS.  ISRAEL ALSO HAS A SHARE AND IS THINKING OF REOPENING THE </p><p>HAIFA-MOSUL PIPELINE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THEIR DESIRE FOR THE </p><p>LAND \'FROM THE NILE TO THE EUPHRATES.\'  ALL THIS IS HAPPENING </p><p>WHILE THE OPPOSITION REMAINS HOPEFUL TO RULE IRAQ!" </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
