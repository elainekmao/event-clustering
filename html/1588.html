TO ASSESS BUSINESS AND OPERATING CONDITIONS OF LARGE </p><p>EMPLOYERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL CITY, ON MARCH 5-7 </p><p>EMBASSY ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL OFFICERS VISITED THREE </p><p>BUSINESSES IN THE SOUTHERN MASVINGO PROVINCE OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p>THE COMPANY/OPERATIONS WERE: </p><p> </p><p>=  RAILWAY BLOCK CHROMIUM MINE, SHURUGWE, 750 EMPLOYEES </p><p>=  BATA SHOE MANUFACTURING, GWERU, 3500 EMPLOYEES </p><p>=  SHABANI ASBESTOS MINE, ZVISHAVANE, 3800 EMPLOYEES </p><p> </p><p>ALL THE BUSINESSES ARE THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THEIR AREA, </p><p>AND BOTH MINES HAVE BEEN OPERATING FROM THE TURN OF THE LAST </p><p>CENTURY.  ALL REPRESENT VERY SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS, AND </p><p>THEIR SHUTDOWN WOULD HAVE SEVERE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES WITH </p><p>WIDE-RANGING RIPPLE EFFECTS.  ALL THREE OPERATIONS PROVIDE </p><p>HOUSING, UTILITIES, EDUCATION AND MEDICAL FACILITIES FOR </p><p>THEIR EMPLOYEES AND DEPENDENTS, AND HAVE SEEN THEIR OPERATING </p><p>COSTS RISE AND MARGINS SLIP IN RECENT TIMES DUE TO HIGH </p><p>DOMESTIC INFLATION.  THE FUEL SHORTAGE HAS ALSO NEGATIVELY </p><p>IMPACTED THEIR OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE MINES, WHICH HAVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01032  151636Z </p><p>TO PROMISE AND PROVIDE FUEL TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD TO </p><p>SECURE SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>EXPORTING IS THE KEY TO SURVIVAL </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. MANAGEMENT AT ALL THREE OPERATIONS TOLD US THAT THE KEY TO </p><p>THEIR VIABILITY IN TODAY\'S HARSH ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IS </p><p>THEIR EXPORT SALES, AND THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE </p><p>DISPOSITION OF A MAJORITY OF THE HARD CURRENCY THEY EARN. </p><p>ALL THREE ARE PURELY PRIVATE-SECTOR OPERATIONS.  BOTH OF THE </p><p>MINING COMPANIES ALLOCATE ABOUT 25 PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL </p><p>FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS TO GOVERNMENT PARASTATALS, </p><p>PRIMARILY THE NATIONAL RAILROAD AND THE NATIONAL ELECTRICITY </p><p>AUTHORITY (BOTH MINES ARE LARGE POWER CONSUMERS AND THE </p><p>RAILROAD TRANSPORTS THE ORE AND THE COAL THEY NEED AS WELL AS </p><p>THE FINISHED PRODUCT).  THEY DO SO ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS TO </p><p>AVOID A GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVE THAT MIGHT ALLOCATE MORE OF </p><p>THEIR EARNINGS, AND THEY WERE HORRIFIED BY THE SHORT-LIVED </p><p>RESERVE BANK DIRECTIVE THAT SEIZED 100 PERCENT OF THEIR </p><p>EXPORT EARNINGS FOR A FEW DAYS IN FEBRUARY (REFTEL).  THE </p><p>EXPORT PERCENTAGES AND EARNINGS OF THE THREE ARE: </p><p> </p><p>=  FERRO-CHROME MINE, EXPORTS 100 PERCENT OF OUTPUT (ABOUT 15 </p><p>TONS/ANNUM OF REFINED CHROME), VALUE: ABOUT U.S. $5 MILLION </p><p>AT CURRENT WORLD PRICES; </p><p>=  BATA SHOES, EXPORTS AN AVERAGE 10 PERCENT OF BATA LABEL </p><p>PRODUCTION (ABOUT 13 MILLION PAIRS/ANNUM) AND 100 PERCENT OF </p><p>NIKE-LICENSED PRODUCTION (VOLUME NOT PROVIDED), VALUE </p><p>OF BATA EXPORTS: ABOUT U.S. 4 MILLION (OFFICIAL RATES); </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01032  151636Z </p><p>=  SHABANIE ASBESTOS MINE, EXPORTS 88 PERCENT OF OUTPUT </p><p>(72,000 TONS/ANNUM OF FIBER), VALUE: ABOUT U.S. $30 MILLION </p><p> </p><p>3. THEREFORE, BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO EXPORT AND COLLECT </p><p>HARD CURRENCY, THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE, ALBEIT </p><p>TENUOUSLY WITH HIGH DOMESTIC INFLATION AND LENDING RATES, </p><p>REDUCED SUPPLIER CREDIT, THE GROWING GULF BETWEEN THE </p><p>OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE, AND CASH FLOW </p><p>DIFFICULTIES.  IF THE GOVERNMENT REPEATS ITS GRAB OF HARD </p><p>CURRENCY FROM EXPORTERS, OR ELIMINATES FOREIGN CURRENCY </p><p>ACCOUNTS ALTOGETHER, THESE COMPANIES WILL CEASE OPERATIONS, </p><p>AS HAS BEEN THE CASE OVER THE LAST YEAR WITH MANY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S GOLD PRODUCERS.  (COMMENT: GOLD PRODUCTION IN 2000 </p><p>WAS DOWN OVER 20 PERCENT FROM THE YEAR BEFORE, FROM 28 TONS </p><p>TO ABOUT 22 TONS, IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>RELEASE OF ONLY 20 PERCENT OF THE HARD CURRENCY EARNED BY </p><p>GOLD SALES TO THE MINING COMPANIES.  END COMMENT.)  THE LOSS </p><p>OF OVER 8,500 JOBS WOULD BE TRAGIC FOR ZIMBABWE, AND FOR NOW </p><p>THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL THREE COME TO WORK EVERY MORNING WITH </p><p>ONLY ONE GOAL IN MIND -- SURVIVAL. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
