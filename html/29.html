<p>S E C R E T MOGADISHU 01643 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SD, UR, US </p><p>SUBJECT: REPORT OF SOMALI OVERTURE T0 SOVIETS </p><p> </p><p>1. (SECRET/NOFORN/WNINTEL/NO CONTRACT/ORCON-ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2. AN ARAB AMBASSADOR TOLD ME FEBRUARY 1T THAT </p><p>SOVIET AMBASSADOR ILICHEV HAD TOLD HIM OF BEING </p><p>APPROACHED RECENTLY BY THE SOMALIS ON THE QUESTION </p><p>OF NORMALIZING RELATIONS. ILICHEV REPORTEDLY </p><p>SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN INVITED TO DINNER BY A RANKING </p><p>OFFICER OF THE SOMALI FOREIGN MINISTRY, WHO HAD WITH </p><p>HIM TWO OTHER MFA OFFICERS. THE SOMALI\'S </p><p>MESSAGE TO ILICHEV HAD BEEN THAT SOMALIA WAS FULLY </p><p>READY TO NORMALIZE ITS RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION. ACCORDING TO MY ARAB SOURCE, ILICHEV SAID </p><p>THAT HE HAD RESPONDED THAT THE SOVIETS WERE READY </p><p>BUT SEVERAL THINGS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE. THE </p><p>SOMALIS WOULD HAVE TO TREAT HIM PRDPERLY AS AN </p><p>AMBASSADOR; THEY WOULD HAVE TD STOP THEIR ANTI- </p><p>SOVIET COMPAIGN; THEY WOULD HAVE TD CALL OFF THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES WHICH HAD PRACTICALLY BUILT A </p><p>WALL AROUND HIS EMBASSY; AND TASS AND THE SOMALI </p><p>NEWS AGENCY SHOULD EXCHANGE CORRESPONDENTS. ILICHEV </p><p>REPORTEDLY SAID THAT SO FAR THE SOMALIS HAD NOT RE- </p><p>SPONDED TO HIS SUGGESTIONS. (I RECALL SIRO\'S APM-2452 </p><p>WHICH MIGHT BE REFERRING TO THE SAME SOMALI-SOVIET </p><p>CONTACT, REPORTING THAT IN MID-JANUARY ILICHEV WAS </p><p>APPROCHED BY THE RECENTLY APPOINTED SOMALI AMBASSADOR </p><p>TO MOSCOW, ABDULLAHI SHEIKH ISMAIL, AND THEN BY THE </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE MPAS ASIA AND SOCIALIST COUNTRIES </p><p>DEPARTMENT, ABDULLAHI EGAL NUR, TO SEEK SOVIET ASSIS- </p><p>TANCE IN CONVINCING ETHIOPIA TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH SOMALIA TO ATTEMPT T0 RESOLVE THE SOMALI- </p><p>ETHIOPIAN CONFLICT.) </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3. AT THE OPENING SESSION OF PARLIAMENT ON </p><p>THE EVENING OF FEBRUARY 11, PRESIDENT SIAD BARRE </p><p>DID NOT MENTION THE UNITED STATES OR WESTERN </p><p>EUROPE BUT SPOKE HARSHLY ABOUT ETHIOPIAN EFFORTS </p><p>TO DESTABLIZE SOMALIA; HE ALSO CRITICIZED SOMALI </p><p>DISSIDENTS WITHOUT NAMING THEM AS SUCH. HE WENT </p><p>ON TO SAY (ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION; A </p><p>WRITTEN TEXT IS NOT YET AVAILABLE) THAT THE </p><p>ETHIOPIANS WERE RECEIVING EXTENSIVE SUPPORT FROM </p><p>THE SOVIET REGIME AND ITS ALLIES. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4. COMMENT: THE REPORT FROM THE ARAB </p><p>AMBASSADOR SOUNDS CREDIBLE. DESPITE HIS STATEMENT </p><p>IN PARLIAMENT, SIAD BARRE MADE A PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT LAST WEEK (MOGADISHU 1520) OF HIS READINESS </p><p>TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW; MOREOVER, </p><p>AS WE NOTED, THIS WAS NOT A NEW DEPARTURE IN SIAD\'S </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS. WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT MOTIVE </p><p>SIAD BARRE MIGHT HAVE FOR MAKING A PRIVATE </p><p>APPROACH TO THE SOVIETS ON NORMALIZATION. MY </p><p>ARAB SOURCE SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS TO </p><p>GOAD US INTO PROVIDING MORE ASSISTANCE, SINCE </p><p>SIAD WOULD ASSUME THAT WE WOULD BECOME AWARE OF </p><p>THE APPROACH. BUT I THINK IT IS ALSO CONCEIVABLE </p><p>THAT EVEN IF SIAD SEES NO POSSIBILITY OF RECEIVING </p><p>FUTURE MILITARY OR DEVELOPMENT AID FROM THE SOVIETS, </p><p>HE MIGHT THINK IT POSSIBLE TO GET THE SOVIETS TO </p><p>RESTRAIN THE ETHIOPIANS FROM PUTTING PRESSURE ON </p><p>HIS BORDERS. </p><p> </p><p>BRIDGES </p><p></p></div>
