<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001276 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/ESC/ESP AND S/CT; GENERAL COUNSEL </p><p>(DAVID AUFHAUSER) AND TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST FINANCING; </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFFICE OF U/S FOR ENFORCEMENT (MICHAEL LEARY); </p><p>OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (MUNRO); OFFICE OF </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (SCHROEDER); DOJ FOR CRIMINAL </p><p>DIVISION/SECTION ON ASSET FORFEITURE (SUZANNE HAYDEN) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2006 </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, EFIN, ETTC, PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: DISCUSSIONS OF CHECHEN AND </p><p>OTHER DESIGNATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) SECSTATE 48257 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 1158 </p><p>     C. (C) ANKARA 126 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) Summary: On February 25, we met with Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs (MFA) Deputy Director General for Research </p><p>and Intelligence Hakan Okcal and his associate Firat Sunel to </p><p>discuss past, recent and upcoming US/UN designations of </p><p>terrorist financiers.  We noted that the US designation of </p><p>three Chechen groups (SECSTATE 48257) is scheduled for </p><p>February 28, and stressed the importance of the GOT </p><p>designating these groups.  Okcal said the GOT would designate </p><p>them as soon as possible after a formal UN designation. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) We began by asking Okcal about follow up GOT action to </p><p>the USG recommendation made in the December 2002 visit of our </p><p>C/T finance experts (ref C).  Okcal said the MFA has recently </p><p>proposed an amendment to existing counterterrorist </p><p>legislation, aimed at expediting the GOT\'s currently </p><p>cumbersome process of terrorist financier designations.  (We </p><p>have not seen the proposed amendment but will follow up </p><p>septel.)  The MFA had not yet received comments from other </p><p>agencies, though Okcal understands informally that MASAK </p><p>(Financial Crimes Investigation Board) and the Finance </p><p>Ministry will support it.  At present, each designation </p><p>requires a Council of Ministers decree, meaning each minister </p><p>must approve.  The MFA is preparing the latest Cabinet </p><p>decree, and Okcal stated that it would include some 20 names, </p><p>including groups/individuals recently designated by the USG </p><p>(Lashkar i Jhangvi, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and Ansar al-Islam). </p><p> However, the Cabinet has not issued a decree for designating </p><p>terrorist financiers since before the AK Party took power in </p><p>November.  Okcal commented that this would be the first C/T </p><p>finance decree for the AK Government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Chechen Designations </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) We shared with Okcal information in ref A previously </p><p>passed to MFA (ref B).  Okcal acknowledged that Turkey is a </p><p>focal point for Chechen support and contains a significant </p><p>Chechen diaspora.  He pointed out that some politicians, </p><p>including Deputy PM Abdullatif Sener, were of Caucasian or </p><p>Chechen descent.  He also noted the importance of not </p><p>designating "the whole nation" (referring to Chechnya)  a </p><p>terrorist group (we pointed out that Chechen separatist </p><p>leader Aslan Maskhadov was not included in the designation). </p><p>Okcal, however, emphasized that the GOT\'s secular </p><p>establishment had every intention of freezing funding of all </p><p>UN-designated terrorist groups, including these Chechen </p><p>groups.  He said that if the UN designation immediately </p><p>followed the US designation on February 28, he would </p><p>undertake to include the Chechens in the latest Cabinet </p><p>decree, which the MFA was planning to circulate interagency </p><p>this coming weekend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ETIM </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) We also queried whether the GOT had seized any assets </p><p>in Turkey belonging to the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement </p><p>(ETIM), a group that was designated by the UN in September </p><p>2002.  Okcal said ETIM was designated in the GOT\'s last </p><p>Cabinet decree of October 2002.  As for ETIM asset seizure, </p><p>"Nothing has been reported to us," Okcal said, adding that </p><p>the Chinese Embassy has been vocal about pushing the GOT but </p><p>had not provided any specific intel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yasin al-Kadi </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Finally, Okcal said that al-Qaida financier Yasin </p><p>al-Kadi had lost his appeal in Turkey.  The appellate court </p><p>decision noted that any name designated by the UN would be </p><p>designated in Turkey, "end of story."  Okcal said that this </p><p>decision establishes a useful judicial precedent for future </p><p>cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Comment:  We will work closely with USUN later this </p><p>week to get an assessment of when exactly the UN will move </p><p>forward with Chechen designation.  In addition, we will </p><p>continue to monitor progress on their draft Cabinet decree, </p><p>including the Chechen groups. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
