<p>S E C R E T TEGUCIGALPA 003206 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR WHA, WHA/CCA, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>STATE FOR INR, S/CT, AND DS/ICI/ITA </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: X1, X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, PGOV, ETTC, PINR, ASEC, HO, CU </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN FM TELLS AMBASSADOR GOH HAS ACCEPTED </p><p>CUBAN AMBASSADORIAL NOMINEE POLANCO </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. CARHART/PALMER E-MAIL NOVEMBER 19 </p><p> </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 3145 </p><p>     C. PIERCE/FISK E-MAIL NOVEMBER </p><p>     D. TEGUCIGALPA 3076 </p><p>     E. STATE 205386 (ALL NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer; Reasons 1.5 (B), (C) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador met with Honduran Foreign Minister </p><p>Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias November 21 at Perez-Cadalso\'s </p><p>request.  FM Perez-Cadalso told Ambassador that the GOH had </p><p>decided to accept the Cuban nomination of Dr. Elis Alberto </p><p>Gonzalez Polanco, Chief of the Cuban Medical Brigade, as the </p><p>first Cuban ambassador to Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The GOH approved Polanco despite the fact that ORCA </p><p>sources have indicated that the Honduran Armed Forces had </p><p>urged President Maduro not to approve Polanco\'s nomination </p><p>because of Polanco\'s alleged activities for Cuban </p><p>intelligence.  (Note: As noted in ref A, ORCA has not been </p><p>able to independently confirm that Polanco is a Cuban </p><p>intelligence officer, but ORCA would not dispute that some of </p><p>the Cuban "doctors" sent to Honduras may be Cuban </p><p>intelligence officers.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) FM Perez-Cadalso announced the news of the GOH\'s </p><p>acceptance of Polanco to reporters shortly after meeting with </p><p>Ambassador.  Perez-Cadalso said that the GOH would not name a </p><p>Honduran ambassador to Cuba until 2003.  Cuban diplomatic </p><p>sources had previously leaked the news of the GOH\'s </p><p>acceptance of Polanco to the press and it was reported in </p><p>Honduran papers the morning of November 21, prior to </p><p>Ambassador\'s meeting with Perez-Cadalso. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Comment:  Post notes that the MFA obeyed the letter </p><p>but not the spirit of President Ricardo Maduro November 12 </p><p>pledge to Ambassador to consult with the Embassy prior to any </p><p>announcement of the acceptance of a Cuban ambassador (ref B). </p><p> Since the news of the GOH\'s acceptance of Polanco had </p><p>already been leaked to the press prior to the FM\'s meeting </p><p>with Ambassador, the meeting was more of a formal </p><p>notification than a consultation.  Post is disappointed that </p><p>Maduro did not continue to delay a decision or reject </p><p>Polanco\'s nomination outright.  Post notes that </p><p>Perez-Cadalso\'s statement that the GOH will not name a </p><p>Honduran ambassador to Cuba until 2003 is in line with </p><p>Maduro\'s statements to Ambassador November 12.  Post also has </p><p>heard rumors that former Human Rights Ombudsman Leo </p><p>Valladares may be under consideration for the post.  If true, </p><p>his appointment would highlight the USG\'s and GOH\'s human </p><p>rights concerns in Cuba.  End Comment. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
