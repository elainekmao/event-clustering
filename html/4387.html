After the </p><p>Prime Minister-designate Abdullah Gul presented the new </p><p>government list to President Sezer, the President made some </p><p>adjustments on the list , mainly on the key ministries such </p><p>as education, defense and interior.  Sezer\'s only rejection </p><p>was of the proposed education minister Besir Atalay.  Besir </p><p>Atalay had been  sacked from his post as Rector of Kirikkale </p><p>University by the Higher Education Board for fundamentalism. </p><p>The education ministry has been given to former ANAP deputy </p><p>Erkan Mumcu.  Initially, the number of the ministers in the </p><p>new cabinet was expected to be 23 plus the Prime Minister. </p><p>However, the number became 24 in the last minute when Vecdi </p><p>Gonul was given a ministerial post after Bulent Arinc\'s </p><p>demand for the Parliament Speaker post.  Observers say that </p><p>the new cabinet is moderate and reasonable.  The list of new </p><p>cabinet members is as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prime Minister : Abdullah Gul </p><p>Deputy PM: Abdullatif Sener </p><p>Deputy PM:Mehmet Ali Sahin </p><p>Deputy PM: Ertugrul Yalcinbayir </p><p>State Minister: Mehmet Aydin </p><p>State Minister: Besir Atalay </p><p>State Minister: Ali Babacan </p><p>State Minister: Kursat Tuzmen </p><p>Education: Erkan Mumcu </p><p>Interior: Abdulkadir Aksu </p><p>Foreign: Yasar Yakis </p><p>Justice: Cemil Cicek </p><p>Defense: Vecdi Gonul </p><p>Finance: Kemal Unakitan </p><p>Housing: Zeki Ergezen </p><p>Health: Recep Akdag </p><p>Transport: Binali Yildirim </p><p>Agriculture: Sami Guclu </p><p>Labor and Social Security: Murat Basesgioglu </p><p>Industry: Ali Coskun </p><p>Energy: Hilmi Guler </p><p>Culture: Huseyin Celik </p><p>Tourism: Guldal Aksit </p><p>Forestry: Osman Pepe </p><p>Environment: Imdat Sutluoglu </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan in Athens, Madrid: All papers front a warm welcome </p><p>given to AKP leader Erdogan in Athens as he continues the EU </p><p>lobbying for Turkey.  Erdogan\'s statement in Athens about </p><p>the AKP\'s desire to solve the Cyprus issue and readiness to </p><p>negotiate the UN\'s Cyprus peace plan are the major </p><p>highlights in Turkish reports.  Papers also noted that Prime </p><p>Minister Simitis pledged Greek support for Turkey\'s EU </p><p>membership while advising Erdogan to only expect a `date for </p><p>setting a negotiation date\', not a negotiating date, for </p><p>Turkey during the upcoming Copenhagen summit.  A large </p><p>number of columnists as travelling press for the Erdogan </p><p>visit emphasize that Erdogan and Simitis had a long tete-a- </p><p>tete meeting without participation of both sides\' Foreign </p><p>Ministry delegations.  Reports note that following a </p><p>delegation to delegation meeting in Madrid, Erdogan is </p><p>expected to visit EU headquarters in Brussels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus:  Papers welcome the EU Commission\'s announcement to </p><p>defer the implementation of the enlargement plan until May </p><p>1, 2003.  Although Brussels announcement cites `due to </p><p>budgetary reasons,\' Turkish papers and television reports </p><p>attribute this decision to the Cyprus issue and the UN peace </p><p>plan in particular.  The overall approach is the </p><p>interpretation of EU\'s delay as `we are deferring our </p><p>decision so that you can reach a settlement on Cyprus.\' </p><p>Reports note that the new government is to take an </p><p>initiative on the Cyprus issue and might declare its </p><p>official position on the Cyprus plan once the cabinet starts </p><p>functioning.  The Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas is quoted </p><p>as saying `they need some time to evaluate and come up with </p><p>a final decision\'.  The Greek Cypriot side has already </p><p>committed itself to negotiate the UN plan, and so will the </p><p>Turkish Cypriot side, the reports surmise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq:  Foreign affairs pages focus on the arrival of UN arms </p><p>inspectors in Baghdad.  Apart from Hans Blix\'s remarks, the </p><p>reports also note that formal inspection is to start </p><p>November 27 and the first results of the inspection to be </p><p>reported to the UN on January 27, 2003. </p><p>International news pages also highlight a NY Times story </p><p>which talks about Washington\'s plan to comfort Turkey and </p><p>Israel\'s worries.  Apart from an extensive aid package for </p><p>Turkey, the Pentagon also plans to station US soldiers to </p><p>the oil-rich region of Kirkuk in order to prevent any </p><p>attempts by locals to establish a separate Kurdish state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p>New Turkish Government/U.S.-Turkey/Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No government has ever been as lucky as the AKP" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand noted the foreign support in mass </p><p>appeal/sensational Posta (11/19): "One of the facts which </p><p>make the AKP government a very lucky one is that it comes </p><p>with US support.  Due to the Iraq issue, AKP has received </p><p>instant support from Washington.  Thus its religious </p><p>tendencies have not even been questioned.  . On the Cyprus </p><p>issue, the AKP is lucky as well.  After years of great </p><p>efforts by Denktas and by the Turkish Foreign Ministry </p><p>bureaucrats, we have reached the current stage that calls </p><p>for a final step to be taken.  That requires courage.  Yet </p><p>the current stage comes along with a very lucky climate as </p><p>well.  If the Turkish side manages to achieve what it wants </p><p>in Cyprus, Turkey\'s horizon will be cleared incredibly." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Dream Might Come True in Cyprus" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief Mehmet Y. Yilmaz wrote in mass appeal </p><p>Milliyet (11/19): "Turkish people want to see a settlement </p><p>in Cyprus.  Turkish people want to see Turkey in the EU. </p><p>And as for the Turkish Cypriots, they do not want to be left </p><p>out while the Greek Cypriots join the European Union.  . </p><p>This common desire calls Denktas to evaluate the UN plan </p><p>very seriously.  An experienced leader like Denktas has the </p><p>ability to perform a diplomatic juggling act and he is </p><p>capable of correcting some mistakes in the plan at the </p><p>negotiation table.  If Denktas believes he does not want to </p><p>discuss this plan at the negotiation table, then I think, he </p><p>should retire." </p><p></p></div>
