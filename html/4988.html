The generals warned that eastern </p><p>Turkey falls within the scope of Iraqi weapons of mass </p><p>destruction, and asked the parliament to approve deployment </p><p>of additional troops in Northern Iraq.  The U.S. is planning </p><p>to attack Iraq from Turkey, Jordan, and Kuwait, and is </p><p>planning to stay in the region for a long time in order to </p><p>restructure the Middle East, TGS officers reportedly said. </p><p>The U.S. has asked Ankara for permission to transfer 80,000 </p><p>troops to Iraq via Turkey, the deployment of 5,000-6,000 </p><p>special troops in Turkish territory, and permission to use </p><p>bases and airports at Incirlik, Batman, Diyarbakir, Corlu, </p><p>Afyon, and Istanbul as well as the ports in Mersin and </p><p>Iskenderun.  The U.S. is also waiting for Ankara\'s approval </p><p>to send 60 trucks of weapons from Incirlik to the Northern </p><p>Iraqi Kurds, papers claim.  The U.S. has been notified that </p><p>Turkey will send 20,000 troops to Northern Iraq in the event </p><p>of war, in addition to the 2,000 soldiers already stationed </p><p>there.  Ankara is planning to set up 18 camps - 13 on the </p><p>Iraqi side of the border - to cope with  an estimated </p><p>250,000 refugees, according to papers.  The TGS has </p><p>announced that 150 U.S. experts were given permission on </p><p>December 16 for site surveys on Turkish bases, and said that </p><p>work would begin in a few days.  Prime Minister Gul said </p><p>upon arrival from his tour of the Middle East that the legal </p><p>disagreement between the U.S. and Turkey over site surveys </p><p>has been resolved.  General Bekir Kalyoncu of the TGS </p><p>Operations and Planning Department is quoted as saying that </p><p>Mosul and Kirkuk should not be given to the Kurds.  Kalyoncu </p><p>said that the U.S. should not launch an operation without a </p><p>second UN resolution, and that the Turkish government needed </p><p>parliamentary approval to participate in a war in Iraq. </p><p>Citing a NYT article speculating about U.S. and UK ambitions </p><p>on Iraqi oil, "Yeni Safak" says on its front page that the </p><p>U.S. would keep Ankara out of the process of reconstructing </p><p>Iraq after Saddam Hussein is toppled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In a press conference following his meetings in Jordan, </p><p>Prime Minister Gul said that the main responsibility for </p><p>working out a peaceful solution to the crisis belongs to </p><p>Saddam Hussein.  In a `surprising statement,\' Gul said he </p><p>might meet Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in order to avert war, </p><p>dailies report.  Gul also said that regional countries </p><p>should use all means to prevent war, and should take joint </p><p>action at the UN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s rights over Iraqi oil: Responding to "Hurriyet"s </p><p>questions regarding Turkey\'s rights over Iraqi oil, former </p><p>diplomats said that an agreement reached in 1926 between </p><p>Britain, Iraq, and Turkey gave Ankara a ten percent share of </p><p>Iraqi oil revenues for 25 years.  Payments to Turkey were </p><p>halted in 1955 following arbitrary payments for 13 years, </p><p>and Ankara can still demand payment for the remaining 12 </p><p>years, the diplomats said.  Turkey\'s former Ambassador to </p><p>Baghdad, Nuzhet Kandemir estimates that Iraq owes Turkey $30 </p><p>billion from the 1926 agreement.  However, Kandemir affirmed </p><p>that Iraq\'s natural resources belong to the Iraqi people, </p><p>and said that Turkey should not claim rights over them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Two opinion polls on the UN-sponsored Cyprus peace </p><p>plan by two Turkish Cypriot dailies produced conflicting </p><p>results.  According to the "Kibris" newspaper survey of 1194 </p><p>Turks between December 27-January 3, 65.4 percent of Turkish </p><p>Cypriots support the UN plan, and 28.2 percent are opposed. </p><p>A survey by the daily "Volkan" on December 25 showed that </p><p>79.8 percent of Turkish Cypriots are against the Annan plan. </p><p>"Aksam" reports on two maps that will reportedly be offered </p><p>by Denktas for a division of Cyprus: The first map offers </p><p>the Karpaz province in the north to the Greek Cypriots, and </p><p>the other envisions Maras to be settled by Turks and Greeks </p><p>under UN security guarantees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq/Saddam Hussein\'s defiant remarks </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Saddam Husssein waits for war" </p><p>Mehmet Barlas opined in mass appeal Aksam (1/7): "Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s message for the Army Day celebration clearly </p><p>defies the US and calls for a holy war.  He accused </p><p>everyone, including the UN inspectors now in Iraq.  The gist </p><p>of this `army day\' message is as follows: Iraq is ready for </p><p>war.  Saddam knows that war is imminent, thus his propaganda </p><p>position is to welcome it.  If only PM Gul were visiting </p><p>Baghdad instead of Syria and Egypt." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Saddam has hurt Gul\'s campaign" </p><p>Ilnur Cevik wrote in English language Turkish Daily News </p><p>(1/7): "The remarks of Saddam Hussein that the UN weapons </p><p>inspectors are spying has come as a blow to those who wanted </p><p>to find a peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis.  The </p><p>efforts of PM Gul to rally support for his peace crusade in </p><p>Syria, Egypt, and Jordan have actually gone down the drain. </p><p>Saddam Hussein is notorious for misreading reality and </p><p>taking the wrong steps.   You just have to look at how he </p><p>waged a war against Iran, and how he invaded Kuwait and then </p><p>refused to withdraw. ... Whatever the reason, the Iraqi </p><p>leader has only strengthened the hand of the Americans, who </p><p>are already massing troops and military hardware in the </p><p>region." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
