<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 HANOI 001615 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; INL/AAE; L/LEI (Sandage) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, EAID, VM, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  GVN RESPONSE TO DRAFT LOA </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Wise/Gatz fax of 6/27/03 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see paragraph </p><p>3. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Embassy received MFA\'s long-awaited response to </p><p>the draft LOA on counternarcotics on June 26.  It appears </p><p>that the USG and GVN views still differ in the areas of </p><p>taxes, immunities, certification, and Leahy.  Full text </p><p>of GVN response in para 5. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests that Department </p><p>consider the GVN response and provide a formal response. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  While there is still a long way ago, </p><p>we find it mildly encouraging that the MFA finally </p><p>responded.  The detailed and lengthy response may </p><p>demonstrate that the GVN, while still holding its ground </p><p>on what it views as the key issues, is at least making a </p><p>good faith effort to keep the process moving. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Begin Text -- </p><p> </p><p>DRAFT LETTER OF AGREETMENT ON US-VN COUNTERNARCOTICS </p><p>COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam has carefully studied the latest draft Letter of </p><p>Agreement on Counter-Narcotics Cooperation between the </p><p>USG and the GVN (LOA) presented by the US and the </p><p>accompanying non-paper. </p><p> </p><p>Actually, a number of consultations on the papers have </p><p>been held between the two sides. Vietnam has expressed </p><p>and shared the need to enhance cooperation of the two </p><p>countries, including in this field. </p><p> </p><p>In the discussions, Vietnam has also explained its points </p><p>and made suggestions that it believes to have taken care </p><p>of the legitimate concerns and interests of both sides. </p><p> </p><p>Again, Vietnam wishes to share the following comments and </p><p>suggestions in the hope that this would further speed up </p><p>the concurrence of the two sides. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS </p><p> </p><p>TITLE OF THE LOA </p><p>-    The addition of `and Law Enforcement\' is newly added </p><p>and needs to be clarified as it may expand the scope of </p><p>the LOA beyond counternarcotics cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>-    The Title should be kept as: `Letter of Agreement on </p><p>Counternarcotics Cooperation between the Government of </p><p>the United States of America and the Government of the </p><p>Socialist Republic of Vietnam,\' which would already cover </p><p>the law enforcement element of counternarcotics </p><p>cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>Part I: General </p><p>-    It is proposed to place the 2nd and 3rd sentences in </p><p>paragraph 2 (`Total US assistance... Law Enforcement </p><p>Affairs\') as a 3rd paragraph of Part II (`Project </p><p>Description\'), as they relate directly to the proposed </p><p>projects and their possible extension (future funding). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STANDARD PROVISIONS </p><p>3.  Property and Personnel </p><p> </p><p>3.A. Property: </p><p> </p><p>-    Paragraph 1, last sentence: The `sale of property\' </p><p>in this paragraph should be read together with the </p><p>`import and disposition of property\' in 7.A. </p><p> </p><p>-    While the property imported into Vietnam is free of </p><p>taxes (7.A.), it is not always true that the funds </p><p>derived from the sale of such property could be all </p><p>designated as from the project.  The price of certain </p><p>items of such imported property, if sold on Vietnam\'s </p><p>market, could be much more appreciated because of the </p><p>taxes.  Let\'s give a technical example to clarify this: </p><p> </p><p>A car imported into Vietnam free of taxes: 10,000 USD </p><p>--     Import tax (10,000 x 100%):         10,000 USD </p><p>--     Special excise/VAT (2x10,000x100%): 20,000 USD </p><p>--     Actual market value at import:      40,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>(30,000 USD different and not from the project, if sold </p><p>in Vietnam) </p><p> </p><p>70%  Original value after 2 years:          7,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>70% Actual market value after 2 years:     28,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>(21,000 USD different and not from the project, if sold </p><p>in Vietnam) </p><p>In both cases, the difference is the tax to be paid by </p><p>the purchaser, not the seller, and is the tax revenue of </p><p>the GVN. </p><p> </p><p>-    The last sentence of 3.A.1. should be then revised </p><p>to take care of the above distorted price, for example: </p><p>`Funds, which are to be derived from the sale of any </p><p>property furnished by the USG to a project in accordance </p><p>with the provisions of 7.A., shall be used in the </p><p>furtherance of the objectives of that project.\' </p><p> </p><p>-    See also comments and suggestions on 7.A. on the </p><p>sale/disposition of the property: the law of Vietnam </p><p>provides that such property is to be taxed on the part of </p><p>the purchaser if sold in Vietnam and is to be tax exempt </p><p>if re-exported.  As result, it must be understood that </p><p>the property imported tax-free, if sold on Vietnam\'s </p><p>market, can only be bought at a price equivalent to </p><p>`actual market price minus eligible tax\' and the </p><p>purchaser, not the seller, shall be obliged to pay this </p><p>tax amount. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.B. Personnel: Paragraph 1 </p><p>-    See comments and proposals on Annex 1 </p><p>(Certification). </p><p> </p><p>3.B. Personnel:  Paragraph 2 </p><p>-    The last sentence is not what had been previously </p><p>consulted and agreed and it is unreasonable to require </p><p>written agreement of the USG in this case (of positioning </p><p>Vietnamese officials). </p><p> </p><p>-    Vietnam proposes to retain the previously agreed </p><p>wording: `This requirement may be waived by appropriate </p><p>notification to the USG by the GVN.\'  Vietnam can also </p><p>accept the addition of `written\' before `notification\' if </p><p>the US so wishes. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Applicable Laws: Paragraph B: </p><p> -   Vietnam prefers to retain what had been previously </p><p>consulted and agreed with regard to the last phrase: `or </p><p>otherwise agreed by both parties\' (instead of the </p><p>currently revised wording: `or otherwise authorized by </p><p>the USG\'). </p><p> </p><p>7.  Taxes: Paragraph A: </p><p>-    The `disposition\' of property in this paragraph </p><p>should be viewed in the context of the comments made on </p><p>the last sentence of 3.A.1. above. </p><p> </p><p>-    The law of Vietnam provides that such property is to </p><p>be taxed on the part of the purchaser if sold in Vietnam </p><p>and is to be tax exempt if re-exported.  As a result, the </p><p>property imported tax-free, if sold on Vietnam\'s market, </p><p>can only be bought at a price equivalent to `actual </p><p>market price minus eligible tax\' and the purchaser, not </p><p>the seller, shall be obliged to pay this tax amount. </p><p> </p><p>-    Paragraph A should be revised as follows: Delete the </p><p>two words `disposition\' in the paragraph and add the </p><p>following to the end of the paragraph: `and the </p><p>disposition of any such property shall be made in </p><p>accordance with the law of the Socialist Republic of </p><p>Vietnam, which provides for the exemption of taxes if re- </p><p>exported or the obligation of the purchaser to pay the </p><p>required taxes if sold in Vietnam.\' </p><p> </p><p>7.  Taxes:  Paragraph B: </p><p>-    The provision in this paragraph is not justified and </p><p>is beyond the law of Vietnam and usual international </p><p>practices. </p><p> </p><p>-    Under law, Vietnam can only provide preferential </p><p>taxation treatment similar to that applicable to ODA </p><p>projects and in the case of double taxation avoidance </p><p>agreement, even in the absence of such an agreement </p><p>between the two countries. Paragraph B should be revised </p><p>accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Status of USG Personnel in Vietnam: Paragraph A: </p><p>-    It is unreasonable to demand the full privileges and </p><p>immunities equivalent to the staff of the US Embassy </p><p>(diplomatic mission) to the `persons\' mentioned in this </p><p>paragraph who are not related to any diplomatic </p><p>responsibilities, are only on short-term missions (few </p><p>days to one or two weeks) and may include consulting firm </p><p>personnel from the US or third countries. </p><p> </p><p>-    Vietnam proposes that: these `persons\' shall be </p><p>accorded with the privileges and immunities similar to </p><p>those granted to personnel of other countries working </p><p>with an ODA project.  This provision, as in the case of </p><p>other countries, would adequately ensure the full </p><p>discharge of their missions under the LOA. </p><p> </p><p>-    (It should be noted that initially there had been a </p><p>provision included in the draft which would stipulate: </p><p>the USG personnel working in Vietnam under the agreement </p><p>shall observe the laws effective in Vietnam). </p><p> </p><p>8.  Status of USG Personnel in Vietnam: Paragraph B: </p><p>-    As explained on 8.A. above, Vietnam proposes that: </p><p>such personnel shall be accorded preferential taxation </p><p>treatment similar to that granted to personnel of other </p><p>countries working with an ODA project. </p><p> </p><p>-    In the current draft: The addition of `and not </p><p>resold in Vietnam\' is welcome but that alone is not yet </p><p>adequate.  It is not justifiable to request the same </p><p>import tax exemption treatment as is accorded to </p><p>diplomatic agents of the US Embassy and the exemption of </p><p>income tax with respect to `income earned while in </p><p>Vietnam\' (this may apply only to the income earned from </p><p>the project). </p><p> </p><p>9.  Annex Two: </p><p>-    See comments and suggestions on Annex 2. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Termination:  Paragraph B: </p><p>-    Paragraph B is totally new and the addition has not </p><p>been consulted.  Further, this paragraph is just to re- </p><p>incorporate the problematic elements of the proposed US </p><p>exclusive right to terminate, which would bring the </p><p>drafting back to the initial stage of the discussions in </p><p>the 1990s.  The US had dropped it years ago.  Vietnam had </p><p>then explained that both sides would equally have `the </p><p>right to terminate\' their respective obligations under </p><p>the agreement and this would be covered by 10.A. </p><p> </p><p>-    Vietnam again insists on the deletion of this </p><p>Paragraph B. </p><p> </p><p>Annex One (Certification): </p><p>-    Vietnam holds that the law of Vietnam, not that of </p><p>the US, applies here, especially in the case of criminal </p><p>prosecution (all acts and activities serving as grounds </p><p>for prosecution would be on the territory of Vietnam, not </p><p>that of the US, including the training to be provided </p><p>under the LOA).  The GVN would subject its personnel to </p><p>the law of Vietnam only, while it shall ensure the </p><p>nomination of `qualified\' personnel. </p><p> </p><p>-    On the other hand, the US concerns would be already </p><p>guaranteed in all stages of consultations on considering, </p><p>granting and execution of the training, by rejecting a </p><p>nominee or terminating the training of a person </p><p>concerned. </p><p> </p><p>-    Vietnam therefore proposes: either not to annex such </p><p>a provision of certification; or, to revise Annex One as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>(i) Delete the Notice and its two footnotes; and, </p><p>(ii) Replace the current paragraph 2 with a new one: `I </p><p>understand that the USG and the GVN may terminate my </p><p>training if it is determined that I engaged in the above </p><p>conduct during the last ten years or during my training </p><p>funded under the LOA.\' </p><p> </p><p>-    Proposed revision (i) is to solve the issue of the </p><p>applicability of law especially in the case of criminal </p><p>prosecution; proposed revision (ii) is to stipulate the </p><p>natural and legitimate right of both Vietnam and the US </p><p>to terminate a person\'s training, especially when the </p><p>training is expected to be on the territory of Vietnam </p><p>and for personnel from Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>-    Vietnam had earlier proposed to have both GVN and </p><p>USG personnel to execute a certification, which is not </p><p>included here, but is still seen as relevant as all </p><p>involved in one same exercise, either with one role or </p><p>the other, would be so required. </p><p> </p><p>Annex Two (Leahy Amendment): </p><p>-    As consistently explained, Vietnam recognizes the </p><p>importance of protecting human rights but rejects the use </p><p>of human rights as a condition for aid provision and as a </p><p>pretext for inference in the internal affairs of states. </p><p> </p><p>-    Vietnam prefers the deletion of this Annex from the </p><p>LOA. If the US finds it mandatory to stipulate its </p><p>responsibility under its law, this stipulation should </p><p>only be a statement of the fact and should be general in </p><p>nature to serve the purpose of stipulating that fact. </p><p> </p><p>-    Vietnam therefore proposes the Annex to be as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>\'Annex Two </p><p>The USG and the GVN recognize the importance of </p><p>protection of human rights and this Annex is made </p><p>pursuant to the provisions of Article 9 of the LOA. </p><p> </p><p>On the US Leahy Amendment Provisions </p><p>The USG holds that the protection of human rights is an </p><p>important element of any bilateral agreement of this </p><p>nature.  It is bound by the US Leahy Amendment </p><p>Provisions, which stipulate that USG narcotics (and </p><p>crime) control assistance is conditioned on the active </p><p>protection of human rights on the part of recipient </p><p>governments.\' </p><p> </p><p>-    Vietnam believes that the above has adequately taken </p><p>care of the USG responsibility. Vietnam cannot accept the </p><p>current paragraph B of the Annex. The following will be </p><p>subjected to further consultations: If the US really </p><p>needs it and as an accommodation, Vietnam could, at the </p><p>most, consider a following addition: </p><p> </p><p>`and that, in certain cases, USG assistance or funds, </p><p>including the funds covered by this agreement and its </p><p>annexes, may not be provided to a foreign government, </p><p>unless the US Secretary of State certifies otherwise.\' </p><p> </p><p>-    The above proposals are for the purpose of </p><p>accommodation. In all cases, Vietnam had wished and had </p><p>proposed either to delete the Annex or to add in the </p><p>Annex the following: `No governments, agencies or </p><p>individuals, including those of the US and Vietnam, are </p><p>entitled to interpret this Annex on the US Leahy </p><p>Amendment Provisions as to make an assessment or judgment </p><p>on human rights of other states, or to use them as a </p><p>condition for assistance or as a pretext for interference </p><p>in the internal affairs or affairs under the jurisdiction </p><p>of other states.\' </p><p> </p><p>Annex Three (Projects): </p><p>-    While the `Standard Provisions\' of the LOA are yet </p><p>to be discussed and agreed, the projects proposed in the </p><p>Annex have not been touched upon.  Those projects, both </p><p>the content and scope, shall be subject to later </p><p>consultations by the two sides. </p><p> </p><p>-    The US has also recognized that the US Department of </p><p>State does not prepare project documents and that once </p><p>the LOA is concluded, the scope, timing, and </p><p>implementation of the proposed projects can be determined </p><p>by the implementing agencies of the two sides. </p><p> </p><p>*** </p><p> </p><p>The discussion of this issue between the USG and the GVN </p><p>has been initiated at least since 1997. Understanding has </p><p>been reached, progress has been made and concurrence has </p><p>been achieved on both the need to enhance cooperation in </p><p>this field and on many elements in the drafting. </p><p> </p><p>This should be built upon to expedite the drafting of the </p><p>LOA. In particular, at this stage of consultation, the </p><p>two sides should devote their focus, on the one hand, on </p><p>the main elements directly related to counternarcotics </p><p>cooperation, and on the other, on how best ensure and </p><p>accommodate the legitimate concerns of both sides, rather </p><p>than just to re-institute what is termed as `standards\' </p><p>but has no relevance in the case. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam respectfully presents the above comments and </p><p>proposals out of the will of accommodation and in the </p><p>hope to facilitate the early conclusion of the drafting </p><p>of the LOA on counternarcotics cooperation of the two </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam hopes that they would be accepted or otherwise </p><p>commented in the same spirit of understanding and </p><p>accommodation. </p><p>(Hanoi, June 2003) </p><p>End text </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
