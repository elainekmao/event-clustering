<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004724 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, August 21, focuses </p><p>on Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb\'s visit to Syria and </p><p>his talks with the Syrian President regarding regional </p><p>and bilateral issues.  Another major story highlights </p><p>Israel\'s assassination of the brother of Ahmad Saadat, </p><p>a leader of the Palestine Front for the Liberation of </p><p>Palestine (PFLP) currently in Palestinian custody. </p><p>All papers report, without comment, the end of the </p><p>Iraqi embassy hostage situation in Germany. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "An enemy does not become a brother" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/21):  "Had we felt even for one moment that the </p><p>Israelis really want peace and that a historical </p><p>reconciliation restoring freedom and land to the </p><p>Palestinians is the solution, we would have called for </p><p>giving peace a chance and we would have urged everyone </p><p>to stop the resistance.  But the number of those </p><p>[Israelis] who believe in peace is minute.  There is </p><p>no point in looking for ways to convince the Israelis </p><p>of peace or to give compromises in order to prove to </p><p>them that the Palestinians want peace.  There is no </p><p>other way for the Palestinians but to continue their </p><p>resistance in the absence of international pressures </p><p>on the enemy.  Anything being said or done that does </p><p>not ultimately support the resistance makes a reward </p><p>for the occupation and the occupiers." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
