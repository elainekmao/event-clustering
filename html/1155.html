<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001797 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR D, T, P, EUR, PM, EUR/RPM, EUR/UBI </p><p>OSD FOR ISA/NATO, ASD GANSLER, DASD VOLKMAN, PASS DSCA </p><p>JCS FOR J-5 EUR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/15/2010 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, ETTC, MCAP, ETRD, KSEP, PREL, NL, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH INITIAL REACTIONS TO DTSI, MORE ON F-16 MNCP </p><p>POSS PURCHASE OF PGM\'S </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 97186 </p><p>     B. BERLIN 2441 </p><p>     C. SECSTATE 101175 </p><p>     D. USNATO 1315 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY A/POLCOUNS E. LUNDBERG; REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U)  ACTION REQUEST - SEE PARA. 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  SUMMARY:  AT FIRST GLANCE, THE DUTCH "WELCOME" THE </p><p>DTSI AND SEE IT AS A "POSITIVE STEP IN TRANSATLANTIC DEFENSE </p><p>TRADE."  NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE RESERVING OVERALL JUDGMENT ON </p><p>THE PROPOSALS UNTIL THEY LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM. THEY ARE ALSO </p><p>EAGER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THE DTSI AND THE EXISTING </p><p>GLOBALIZATION TALKS RELATE TO EACH OTHER. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C)  EMBASSY POLITICAL AND ODC REPS MET ON 6/13 WITH MFA </p><p>AND MOD OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS INITIAL DUTCH REACTIONS TO THE </p><p>DEFENSE TRADE SECURITY INITIATIVE.  DUTCH ECONOMICS MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIALS PREVIOUSLY HAD ATTENDED A DUTCH INTERNAL MEETING </p><p>AND THEIR COMMENTS WERE PASSED ON BY MFA OFFICIALS. </p><p>CAVEATING THAT THEIR REACTIONS WERE ONLY "INITIAL AND NOT YET </p><p>AUTHORITATIVE," DUTCH DEPUTY SECURITY POLICY PDAS GAIUS </p><p>SCHELTEMA AND DAS FOR EXPORT CONTROLS JOHAN COERT "WELCOMED </p><p>THE DTSI" AS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN THE TRANSATLANTIC </p><p>TRADE MARKETPLACE. SCHELTEMA SAID THAT THE "SPECIFIC LINK TO </p><p>THE DCI IS ALSO POSITIVE AND IMPORTANT."  COERT ADDED THE </p><p>DUTCH RECOGNIZED THAT MANY OF THE DTSI ELEMENTS WERE KEYED TO </p><p>MOU GROUP LONG-STANDING TOPICS.  ASKED BY POLOFF, COERT ADDED </p><p>THAT INFORMAL DISCUSSION AMONG MOU GROUP MEMBERS IN </p><p>WASHINGTON WAS ALSO "POSITIVE AND DEEMED A REAL STEP FORWARD." </p><p>COERT ALSO ADDED THAT THE DUTCH ECONOMICS MINISTRY AEROSPACE </p><p>DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR HAD JUST REPORTED TO HIS MFA AND MOD </p><p>COLLEAGUES THAT DUTCH DEFENSE-RELATED COMPANIES WERE </p><p>IMPRESSED BY THE INITIATIVE AND GENUINELY SENSED NEW </p><p>POTENTIAL MARKET ACCESS AND TEAMING OPPORTUNITIES AS A RESULT </p><p>OF THE DTSI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C)  DUTCH MOD REP H.J. JANSEN EXPRESSED A KEEN INTEREST, </p><p>SECONDED BY THE MFA, IN LEARNING HOW THE EXISTING OSD-LED </p><p>GLOBALIZATION DIALOGUE RELATED TO THE DTSI.  POLOFF EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT DTSI PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE EXPORT-CONTROL AND </p><p>SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGY/INFORMATION SAFEGUARDING ELEMENTS ON THE </p><p>GLOBALIZATION PILLAR STRUCTURE, BUT THAT THE TWO PROCESSES </p><p>WERE STILL DIFFERENT.  THE DUTCH NOTED THAT DASD VOLKMAN </p><p>ALREADY HAD INVITED MOD\'S DIRECTOR FOR PLANS AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MATERIEL RELATIONS, BGEN TEUSSINK, TO JULY 11 </p><p>TALKS IN WASHINGTON TO FURTHER EXPLORE A POSSIBLE </p><p>U.S.-NETHERLANDS DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES FOR DEFENSE </p><p>EQUIPMENT AND INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION (DOP).  THEY SAID THAT </p><p>THEY HOPED TO HEAR MORE DETAILS THEN ON WHEN INDIVIDUAL </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE DTSI WOULD BECOME OFFICIAL, HOW THEY WOULD </p><p>RELATE TO THE DOP PROCESS AND WHAT SPECIFICALLY WAS EXPECTED </p><p>OF DUTCH TO COMPLY WITH ASPECTS OF THE OPPORTUNITIES OUTLINED </p><p>IN THE DOP AND DTSI DIALOGUES. (EMBASSY COMMENT;  THIS WOULD </p><p>BE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR PM PDAS SUCHAN TO BRIEF DUTCH </p><p>OFFICIALS ON THE DTSI, AS NOTED IN REF.B. END COMMENT.)  BOTH </p><p>MOD AND MFA INTERLOCUTORS ALSO SUGGESTED THE U.S. USE </p><p>COMBINATIONS OF A WEBSITE, REGULAR MOU GROUP BRIEFINGS, AND </p><p>BOTH BACKGROUND NATO COMMITTEE AND POLITICAL LEVEL GATHERINGS </p><p>TO REPORT PROGRESS. THEREBY, THEY INDICATED, THE ALLIANCE </p><p>COULD USE PEER PRESSURE AS A CATALYST FOR BUILDING AND </p><p>MAINTAINING MOMENTUM FOR THE PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C)  EMBASSY OFFICIALS THEN REVIEWED THE DTSI ELEMENTS, WIT </p><p>THE DUTCH PROBING TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED OF THE </p><p>DUTCH GOVERNMENT, EITHER IN POLITICAL COMMITMENTS, REGULATORY </p><p>ADJUSTMENTS OR NEW LEGISLATION, TO RESPOND TO THE U.S. </p><p>OVERTURES.  WE EXPLAINED THAT THEY SHOULD RECONSIDER THEIR </p><p>PAST REFUSAL TO SIGN ONTO A BLANKET ASSURANCES AND ADVANCE </p><p>CONSENT FOR THIRD COUNTRY TRANSFER OF USG-SOLD OR GRANTED </p><p>DEFENSE ARTICLES STATEMENT.  THE MFA SECURITY POLICY LAWYERS </p><p>WERE NON-COMMITTAL IN RESPONSE, BUT HEARD OUT OUR ARGUMENTS </p><p>ABOUT HOW IT WOULD STREAMLINE LICENSING, REDUCE RISKS FOR </p><p>CAPITAL INVESTORS IN DEFENSE PROGRAMS AND BE A CATALYST FOR </p><p>MORE PREDICTABLE TRANSATLANTIC MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS, ALL </p><p>CATALYSTS TO BETTER NATO DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION. </p><p>(NOTE:  THE DUTCH CHAMPIONED MOU GROUP REVIEW OF THIS MEASURE </p><p>SEVERAL YEARS AGO ONLY TO REFUSE TO SIGN ONTO SUCH LANGUAGE </p><p>AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH THE USG. END NOTE). </p><p>WE ALSO NOTED THAT THEY ALREADY OPERATE A SPECIAL EMBASSY </p><p>LICENSING PROGRAM.  THE DUTCH SEEMED MOST INTERESTED IN </p><p>LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE MAJOR PROJECT AND GLOBAL COOPERATIVE </p><p>PROGRAM AUTHORIZATIONS AS WELL AS WHAT ROLE THEY MIGHT PLAY </p><p>IN FACILITATING DUTCH BUSINESSES PARTICIPATING IN THE TECH </p><p>DATA EXPORT AUTHORIZATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C)  SEPARATELY, DUTCH DEPUTY CHOD VAN BAAL DISCUSSED THE </p><p>F-16 MNCP POSSIBLE JOINT ACQUISITION OF U.S. PGMS WITH POLOFF </p><p>ON 6/14, NOTING IT COULD BE WORTH UP TO USD 400 MILLION IN </p><p>EVENTUAL PURCHASES. HE SOUGHT ASSURANCES THAT THE DTSI COULD </p><p>ACCOMMODATE THE LIKELY NECESSARY WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION </p><p>PERMISSIONS AND MULTIPLE DESTINATION LICENSES.  POLOFF </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE ITEMS WERE HLSG-LISTED PRIORITIES AND THUS </p><p>A KEY FOCUS OF THE DTSI. WHILE OFFERING NO SPECIFIC, BINDING </p><p>ASSURANCE, POLOFF NOTED THE SORT OF "JOINT BUY" PROPOSED ON </p><p>THE NATO DEFMIN MARGINS WOULD BE THOSE WE HOPE TO EXPEDITE </p><p>WITH THE FMS REFORMS.  VAN BAAL SEEMED CONTENT WITH ANSWER </p><p>AND INDICATED THAT HE MIGHT SUGGEST TO BGEN TEUSSINK THAT </p><p>THIS ISSUE BE ADDRESSED IN THE JULY 11 MEETINGS WITH DASD </p><p>VOLKMAN.  VAN BAAL ALSO NOTED THAT, WHILE THE DANES STILL </p><p>NEEDED MORE TIME TO EXAMINE SOME OF THE "VIRTUAL WAREHOUSING" </p><p>PROPOSALS AND COST FIGURES, HE FORESAW AN EARLY FALL 2000 </p><p>TIMEFRAME FOR THE MNCP COUNTRIES TO FINALIZE THEIR PROPOSAL </p><p>FOR THE JOINT PGM ACQUISITION.  HE ADDED THAT THE FIRST </p><p>WORKING GROUP IMPLEMENTATION MEETING WOULD BE "NEXT WEEK" IN </p><p>LEUVEN BELGIUM.  HE ALSO ELABORATED THAT THE MNCP COUNTRIES </p><p>WERE ALL SEEKING LANTIRN AND WOULD FOCUS THEIR VIRTUAL </p><p>WAREHOUSING ACQUISITIONS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE NEW </p><p>GPS-GUIDED FAMILY OF PGM\'S.  "THIS WAY WE CAN BUY INTO THE </p><p>U.S. WAR STOCKS FOR CRISIS SITUATIONS," HE SUMMARIZED," AND </p><p>YOU CAN BE REASSURED THAT WE WILL NOT BUY THESE SORTS OF </p><p>BOMBS ELSEWHERE." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
