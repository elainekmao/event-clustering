<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BRUSSELS 003186 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, CU, EUN, USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>SUBJECT: EU CUBA POLICY: EMPHASIZING THE "CRITICAL" IN THE </p><p>EU\'S "CRITICAL DIALOGUE" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) STATE 163468 </p><p>     B. B) ATHENS 2081 </p><p>     C. C) WARSAW 2299 </p><p>     D. D) VILNIUS 758 </p><p>     E. E) HAVANA 9549 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: USEU Poloff Todd Huizinga, </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action message. See para 10. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary: On June 18, Poloff delivered reftel </p><p>demarche (ref a) and discussed the EU\'s announced </p><p>reevaluation of its common position on Cuba.  Karl Buck </p><p>(protect) of the EU Council Secretariat, said that the </p><p>visit to Cuba of the Austrian Justice Minister </p><p>Boehmdorfer (ref a) was in line with the EU\'s announced </p><p>policy of limiting, but not banning, high-level EU visits </p><p>to Cuba.  Buck said that he was drafting a reevaluation </p><p>of EU Cuba policy that was slated to serve as the basis </p><p>for a new common position to be approved by EU foreign </p><p>ministers at the July 22 General Affairs and External </p><p>Relations Council (GAERC).  He said his recommendation </p><p>would likely be to continue the EU\'s "critical dialogue" </p><p>with Cuba, but with a greater emphasis on the "critical." </p><p>With the policy revision just beginning, Department may </p><p>want to urge EU member states and institutions via </p><p>political-level demarches to formulate a Cuba policy that </p><p>foresees real consequences for Cuba\'s continued flouting </p><p>of international norms.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>EU Secretariat: Austrian Cuba Visit </p><p>Puzzling, But In Line with </p><p>Restrictions on High-Level Contacts </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Karl Buck (protect), Head of the Latin America </p><p>Division in the EU Council Secretariat, told Poloff that, </p><p>while he was somewhat puzzled that an EU member-state </p><p>minister would visit Cuba at this moment, the EU\'s </p><p>limitation of high-level contacts with Cuba did not </p><p>preclude Boehmdorfer\'s visit.  In fact, Buck stressed, </p><p>the Austrians had consulted him on that very question to </p><p>be sure they would not be breaking with the EU decision. </p><p>Buck said that, although he had not been privy to </p><p>Boehmdorfer\'s talking points, he was certain that </p><p>Boehmdorfer would deliver a firm message to the GOC </p><p>reiterating that the recent crackdown and the June 12 </p><p>public denigration of Berlusconi and Aznar were </p><p>unacceptable.  However, Buck allowed that the USG view as </p><p>expressed in reftel demarche made sense from our </p><p>perspective, and promised to share the USG points with </p><p>his counterparts in member-state ministries. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>New Common Position Planned for July 22: </p><p>Continued Critical Dialogue Likely </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Buck said he would be the principal drafter of a </p><p>proposed revised common position on Cuba.  His paper is </p><p>due for presentation to the EU Latin America Working </p><p>Group (COLAT), which coordinates working-level policy </p><p>formulation among member states, on July 1.  In mid-July, </p><p>a COLAT-revised version will then go to the Political and </p><p>Security Committee (PSC) to prepare it for final approval </p><p>by EU FonMins at the July 22 GAERC. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Cautioning that he was just beginning to draft, </p><p>Buck said the paper would have two main sections.  One </p><p>part would examine whether current EU development </p><p>assistance activity in Cuba was effectively promoting EU </p><p>objectives there (peaceful transition to democracy, </p><p>economic reform, respect for human rights).  That </p><p>section, said Buck, would be drafted by EU member-state </p><p>development officials.  Buck added that he had "no idea </p><p>what each of the member states is doing on development in </p><p>Cuba." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Buck said the section he is preparing would </p><p>propose restructuring the EU\'s critical dialogue with </p><p>Cuba so as to promote more effectively the EU\'s unchanged </p><p>objectives there (see para 4 above).  When pressed for </p><p>specifics, Buck remained vague.  It appears, though, that </p><p>Buck is planning to suggest, when all is said and done, </p><p>more of what the EU has announced in recent statements: </p><p>a tougher line on GOC repression and specific signals of </p><p>the EU\'s disapproval of Cuba\'s actions within the </p><p>framework of a continued EU-Cuba "critical dialogue." </p><p>The three measures announced on June 5, limiting high- </p><p>level governmental visits, reducing the profile of member </p><p>states\' participation in cultural events, and inviting </p><p>Cuban dissidents at national day celebrations may be </p><p>reiterated, but Buck did not share specifics of any new </p><p>ideas. </p><p>COLAT Consensus:  Don\'t Isolate Cuba </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>7. (C) Buck noted his impression that the Cuban attempt </p><p>to humiliate Aznar and Berlusconi had brought the member </p><p>states closer together in mutual support, regardless of </p><p>"opinions you or I may have about Berlusconi."  He said </p><p>that, while he perceived shades of difference among </p><p>member states on how tough they wanted to get with Cuba, </p><p>"no one" had advocated cutting off dialogue.  He said the </p><p>sense remained within the COLAT that isolating Cuba would </p><p>only play into the hands of the regime\'s hardliners. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>EU Approach to Remain Distinct </p><p>From That of U.S. </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Several times, Buck averred that USINT Havana\'s </p><p>recent tough criticism of the regime had provided Castro </p><p>with a cover and a justification for his actions.  (Buck </p><p>did not specify which actions.)  His impression was that </p><p>some U.S. "hardliners" thought that the EU might be </p><p>coming around to an approach more supportive of the U.S. </p><p>embargo.  He stressed that that was not the case, and </p><p>implied that part of the EU motivation for reevaluating </p><p>its Cuba policy was to avoid getting squeezed between </p><p>"hardliners in the U.S. and hardliners in Cuba" towards </p><p>cutting lines of communication with Cuba. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Buck said, however, that he believed that the </p><p>statement of the EU\'s revised common position would avoid </p><p>criticism of the U.S. embargo.  He said he doubted that </p><p>the statement would mention any third parties at all, but </p><p>that if the U.S. were mentioned, it would likely not be </p><p>in name, but indirectly in an assertion of the EU\'s </p><p>intention to work together with its partners to promote </p><p>democracy in Cuba. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Comment:  USG May Want to Push </p><p>for Tougher EU Cuba Policy </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The EU has repeatedly taken a tough line toward </p><p>Cuba recently, culminating in declarations on June 5 and </p><p>June 16 limiting contacts with Cuba and declaring Cuban </p><p>behavior toward the EU unacceptable.  As USINT Havana </p><p>points out (ref e), the GOC\'s recent taunts of the EU </p><p>virtually dare it to take a stronger position against the </p><p>regime.  Nonetheless, it appears that the new common </p><p>position on Cuba could well become, for all practical </p><p>purposes, more of the same:  continuation of EU dialogue </p><p>with Cuba interspersed with regular, perhaps harsher but </p><p>basically inconsequential, declarations condemning GOC </p><p>repression.  With the reformulation of EU Cuba policy in </p><p>its beginning stages, this may be the time for us to push </p><p>the EU to back up its words with actions.  To that end, </p><p>post asks Department to consider approaching member and </p><p>accession states and EU institutions at the political </p><p>level to urge them that their common position on Cuba </p><p>include real consequences for Cuba\'s continued failure to </p><p>live up to international norms.  With the regime\'s anti- </p><p>EU antics, with Italy taking up the EU presidency on July </p><p>1, and with many of the Central European EU accession </p><p>states expressing strong aversion to GOC actions (refs c </p><p>and d), a high-level demarche could carry considerable </p><p>weight.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>FOSTER </p><p></p></div>
