(C) ON MARCH 9, ACTING PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY (PDAS) MARK BELLAMY, CHARGE EARL IRVING, AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ECONOFF (NOTETAKER) MET WITH STERNFORD MOYO, PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE LAW SOCIETY OF ZIMBABWE AND A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>JUDICIAL SERVICES COMMISSION, AND BEATRICE MTETWA, THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN LAWYER WHO IS COORDINATING THE OPPOSITION </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE\'S (MDC) LEGAL CHALLENGES </p><p>TO LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>STATE OF THE JUDICIARY IN ZIMBABWE.  BELLAMY EXPRESSED </p><p>THE USG\'S CONCERN THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) </p><p>IS SELECTIVELY APPLYING THE RULE OF LAW, AND IS </p><p>THREATENING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY.  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISES </p><p>AFFECTING ZIMBABWE, AND THE GOZ\'S REACTIONS TO THESE </p><p>CRISES, THE USG WAS RE-EVALUATING ITS POLICIES TOWARDS </p><p>THE GOZ.  MOYO AND MTETWA AGREED THAT THE SITUATION IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS DETERIORATING, AND THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS </p><p>ACTIVELY UNDERMINING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. </p><p>MOYO PINPOINTED THE THREAT TO THE JUDICIARY\'S </p><p>INDEPENDENCE TO HAVE BEGUN IN EARNEST IN FEBRUARY 2000 </p><p>AFTER A MAJORITY OF ZIMBABWEAN VOTERS REJECTED THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION SUPPORTED BY MUGABE.  WITH THE FINAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01026  01 OF 03  151129Z </p><p>AGREEMENT ON THE RESIGNATION OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT ON MARCH 2, MOYO FEARS THAT THE CONTINUED </p><p>INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY IS EXTREMELY PRECARIOUS. </p><p>THE LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT INDICATED THAT THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>THE MEMBERS OF THE ZIMBABWE LEGAL PROFESSION OPPOSE </p><p>THESE DEVELOPMENTS.  MOYO IS ALSO COORDINATING EFFORTS </p><p>TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A WAY TO BLOCK MUGABE\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU, THE JUDGE PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE HIGH COURT, AS THE NEXT CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT.  IN A SEPARATE MEETING WITH BELLAMY ON </p><p>MARCH 10, CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY SAID THAT HE NOW </p><p>BELIEVES MUGABE IS DETERMINED TO ELIMINATE THE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, AND THAT HE WILL NOT GIVE </p><p>UP POWER, EVEN IF HE LOSES THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>BELLAMY EXPRESSES USG CONCERNS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BELLAMY OPENED THE MEETING BY EXPRESSING THE </p><p>HEIGHTENED USG CONCERN WITH DEVELOPMENTS THAT APPEAR TO </p><p>THREATEN ZIMBABWE\'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  BELLAMY </p><p>SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE BOMBING OF "THE DAILY NEWS" </p><p>PRINTING PRESS, THE FORCED RESIGNATION OF THE CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT, ANTHONY GUBBAY, AND THE </p><p>EXPULSION OF TWO FOREIGN JOURNALISTS, AS PARTICULARLY </p><p>ALARMING DEVELOPMENTS.  HE STATED THAT WASHINGTON </p><p>WORRIED THAT THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE WAS </p><p>DETERIORATING RAPIDLY, AND SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE </p><p>USG CONCERN THAT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01026  01 OF 03  151129Z </p><p>APPEARS THREATENED.  HE ASKED MOYO AND MTETWA WHAT THEY </p><p>FELT WOULD BE PROPER RESPONSES BY THE USG TO THIS </p><p>SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>A LONG TRADITION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MOYO LAID OUT THE HISTORY OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE GOING BACK TO THE COLONIAL PERIOD.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT EXCEPT FOR SPECIFIC CASES DURING THE </p><p>COLONIAL, UNILATERAL DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND </p><p>POST-INDEPENDENCE PERIODS, THE JUDICIARY HAS ALWAYS </p><p>MAINTAINED ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM THE EXECUTIVE AND </p><p>LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF THE GOZ.  AT THE TIME OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE IN 1980, THE JUDICIARY DECIDED </p><p>THAT JUDGES COULD SERVE THE NEW GOVERNMENT REGARDLESS OF </p><p>WHO WAS IN POWER.  FOLLOWING THE 1980 ELECTIONS, THERE </p><p>WAS A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NEW MUGABE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THE JUDICIARY OVER WHOM WOULD BECOME THE CHIEF JUSTICE. </p><p>THE JUDICIARY WANTED TO FOLLOW THE RULE THAT THE SENIOR </p><p>APPELLATE JUDGE WOULD BECOME CHIEF JUSTICE.  THE THEN </p><p>PRIME MINISTER MUGABE, ON THE OTHER HAND, WANTED TO MAKE </p><p>A POLITICAL APPOINTEE CHIEF JUSTICE.  IN THE END, A </p><p>COMPROMISE WAS REACHED WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF A JUSTICE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2112 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01026  02 OF 03  151130Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  BBG-00   R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------D20CE5  151130Z /38 </p><p>R 151126Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8434 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 001026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/15/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KJUS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE LEGAL COMMUNITY IS EXTREMELY CONCERNED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01026  02 OF 03  151130Z </p><p>THAT MUGABE IS SUBVERTING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE </p><p> </p><p>WHO HAD RESIGNED FROM THE RHODESIAN SUPREME COURT IN </p><p>1968, FOLLOWING DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE UDI GOVERNMENT </p><p>OVER LEGAL RULINGS, AND HAD RETURNED TO THE UNITED </p><p>KINGDOM.  MOYO CONCLUDED THAT UP UNTIL A YEAR AGO, WITH </p><p>A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS RELATED TO COURT DECISIONS </p><p>DURING THE 1983-87 REPRESSION OF THE NDEBELE IN SOUTHERN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, THE GOZ HAD LARGELY RESPECTED THE JUDICIARY\'S </p><p>INDEPENDENCE AND HAD ENFORCED COURT RULINGS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>THE ASSAULT ON THE JUDICIARY BEGINS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO MOYO, THE GOZ ASSAULT ON THE </p><p>JUDICIARY BEGAN IN EARNEST FOLLOWING THE VOTER REJECTION </p><p>OF THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION IN FEBRUARY 2000.  MOYO </p><p>BELIEVES THAT MUGABE AND THE GOZ PANICKED FOLLOWING THIS </p><p>VOTE, AND BEGAN TO SEE ENEMIES IN EVERY CORNER OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  WHEN THE GOZ-SPONSORED FARM INVASIONS BY "WAR </p><p>VETS" AND SQUATTERS BEGAN IN EARNEST FOLLOWING THE "NO" </p><p>VOTE ON THE CONSTITUTION, COURT RULINGS AGAINST THESE </p><p>INVASIONS PUT THE JUDICIARY ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH </p><p>MUGABE AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE GOZ.  SINCE LAST </p><p>FEBRUARY THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF SUPREME COURT AND </p><p>HIGH COURT RULINGS THAT HAVE ORDERED THE GOZ TO EVICT </p><p>THE "WAR VETS" AND SQUATTERS FROM OCCUPIED FARMS, AS </p><p>WELL AS TO FOLLOW EXISTING LAW IN UNDERTAKING LAND </p><p>REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT.  MOYO ADDED THAT OVER THE PAST </p><p>YEAR THE GOZ HAS (IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01026  02 OF 03  151130Z </p><p>FARMERS UNION) AGREED TO TWO SUPREME CONSENT ORDERS (ONE </p><p>IN MARCH 2000, THE OTHER IN NOVEMBER 2000) THAT STATED </p><p>THAT THE GOZ WAS NOT FOLLOWING ITS OWN LAWS IN PURSUING </p><p>THE "FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, AND THAT IT </p><p>SHOULD BEGIN TO DO SO BY REMOVING THE OCCUPIERS. </p><p>FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER CONSENT ORDER, "WAR VETS" BEGAN </p><p>TO THREATEN THE SUPREME COURT JUDGES, AND THE GOZ BEGAN </p><p>A FULL-COURT PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN THAT CLAIMED THE </p><p>JUDICIARY WANTED TO BRING BACK "WHITE SETTLER" RULE AND </p><p>AGAIN MAKE ZIMBABWE A COLONY OF BRITAIN.  THIS CAMPAIGN </p><p>RESULTED IN CHIEF JUSTICE GUBBAY REQUESTING A MEETING </p><p>WITH ACTING PRESIDENT SIMON MUZENDA (MUGABE WAS OUT OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY).  AT THIS MEETING, GUBBAY REQUESTED THAT </p><p>THE GOZ OFFER ADDITIONAL PROTECTION TO THE JUSTICES, AND </p><p>IF THEY WOULD NOT, GUBBAY STATED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO </p><p>RESIGN.  MOYO OPINED THAT THE GOZ SEIZED ON THIS </p><p>STATEMENT, AND FORCED GUBBAY TO TENDER HIS RESIGNATION </p><p>TWO DAYS LATER. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>APPOINTING A RUBBER STAMP CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AFTER CONSIDERABLE WRANGLING, A FINAL AGREEMENT </p><p>WAS REACHED ON MARCH 2 BETWEEN THE GOZ AND GUBBAY, </p><p>WHEREBY THE LATTER WOULD GO ON LEAVE FROM THE BEGINNING </p><p>OF MARCH UNTIL THE END OF JUNE.  PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD, </p><p>AS A RESULT, BE FREE TO APPOINT AN ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, </p><p>BUT COULD NOT APPOINT A NEW CHIEF JUSTICE UNTIL JULY 1. </p><p>MUGABE QUICKLY NOMINATED THE JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE HIGH </p><p>COURT, GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU, AS THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01026  02 OF 03  151130Z </p><p>ON MARCH 9, AND HE WAS SWORN IN ON MARCH 13. </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU HAD LONG BEEN RUMORED TO BE MUGABE\'S CHOICE </p><p>FOR CHIEF JUSTICE DUE TO HIS LONG HISTORY AS A LOYAL </p><p>SUPPORTER OF ZANU-PF.  (NOTE: CHIDYAUSIKU HEADED THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION THAT PREPARED THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION THAT WAS REJECTED IN THE FEBRUARY 2000 </p><p>REFERENDUM.  ZIMBABWEAN CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS HAD </p><p>PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM </p><p>PROCESS HAD BEEN HIJACKED BY THE GOZ AND THE FINAL </p><p>VERSION DID NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>SOCIETY.  END NOTE.)  MOYO ADMITTED THAT MUGABE HAD THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO APPOINT WHOMEVER HE CHOSE AS </p><p>ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE.  HOWEVER, HE STATED THAT THE ISSUE </p><p>IS NOT CLEAR FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A CHIEF JUSTICE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MOYO, THE JUDICIAL SERVICES COMMISSION </p><p>(JSC), OF WHICH HE IS A MEMBER, HAS A KEY ROLE IN </p><p>ADVISING THE PRESIDENT ON THE APPOINTMENT OF A CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE.  HE MADE CLEAR THAT MEMBERS OF THE JSC WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO BLOCK CHIDYAUSIKU\'S APPOINTMENT AS </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE.  MOYO IS CONCERNED THAT IF CHIDYAUSIKU IS </p><p>APPOINTED CHIEF JUSTICE HE WILL BE IN A POSITION TO HELP </p><p>MUGABE REMOVE OTHER SUPREME COURT AND HIGH COURT </p><p>JUSTICES, AND REPLACE THEM WITH JUDGES WHO WILL BE </p><p>COMPLIANT WITH MUGABE AND ZANU-PF.  THIS WOULD, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MOYO, MARK THE END OF ANY HOPE FOR A TRULY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2113 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01026  03 OF 03  151130Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  BBG-00   R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------D20CEF  151130Z /38 </p><p>R 151126Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8435 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 001026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/15/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KJUS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE LEGAL COMMUNITY IS EXTREMELY CONCERNED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01026  03 OF 03  151130Z </p><p>THAT MUGABE IS SUBVERTING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE </p><p> </p><p>DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION IN ZIMBABWE.

(C) BELLAMY AND CHARGE CALLED ON CHIEF JUSTICE GUBBAY </p><p>AT HIS HOME MARCH 10.  THE SOFT-SPOKEN JUDGE RECOUNTED </p><p>HOW WAR VETERANS HAD INVADED THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ITS </p><p>DECISIONS ON THE "FAST-TRACK" PROGRAM AND THE FARM </p><p>INVASIONS.  GUBBAY POINTED OUT THAT ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>DECISIONS HAD BEEN LABELED "RACIST" BY THE GOZ, THEY HAD </p><p>ACTUALLY BEEN MADE BY NON-WHITE JUDGES.  GUBBAY ADDED </p><p>THAT WHITE JUDGES ARE A MINORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF BOTH </p><p>THE HIGH AND SUPREME COURTS, BUT THE GOZ DOES NOT LIKE </p><p>TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS.  GUBBAY CONFIRMED THAT VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT MUZENDA HAD REFUSED TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF </p><p>JUSTICES FROM THE "WAR VETS".  MINISTER OF JUSTICE </p><p>PATRICK CHINAMASA TOLD GUBBAY THAT IT WAS "NORMAL" FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01026  03 OF 03  151130Z </p><p>"WAR VETS" TO REACT BADLY TO THE COURT\'S DECISIONS, AND </p><p>THAT THE JUSTICES SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED THIS.  GUBBAY </p><p>SAID HE HAD DESPAIRED AT HIS INABILITY TO REASON WITH </p><p>MUZENDA AND CHINAMASA.  GUBBAY INDICATED THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE LEGAL COMMUNITY DID NOT RATE HIGHLY JUDGE </p><p>PRESIDENT CHIDYAUSIKU IN TERMS OF EITHER EXPERTISE OR </p><p>IMPARTIALITY.  HE ADDED THAT THE REMAINING FOUR SUPREME </p><p>COURT JUSTICES - ALL OF WHOM GUBBAY PRAISED FOR THEIR </p><p>PROFESSIONALISM AND ETHICS - WOULD ACT AS A BRAKE ON THE </p><p>NEW CHIEF JUSTICE FOR AT LEAST A WHILE.  GUBBAY REVEALED </p><p>THAT THERE IS NO GOOD LEGAL WAY FOR PRESIDENT MUGABE TO </p><p>OUST THE REMAINING JUSTICES AND THAT HE WOULD MOST </p><p>LIKELY INSTEAD ATTEMPT TO PACK THE COURT WITH ZANU-PF </p><p>LOYALISTS.  (NOTE: THE ZIMBABWE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT </p><p>SET A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. </p><p>END NOTE.)  THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS CONVINCED THAT MUGABE </p><p>WILL NOT RELINQUISH POWER EVEN IF HE LOSES THE NEXT </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  HE ADDED THAT HE IS DEEPLY </p><p>SADDENED THAT ZIMBABWE\'S HIGHEST COURTS, WHICH HAD FOR </p><p>TWENTY YEARS OPERATED AS A STRONG CONSTITUTIONAL CHECK </p><p>AGAINST ABUSES OF EXECUTIVE POWER, APPEARED TO BE </p><p>NEARING AN END AS AN INDEPENDENT BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.

THE GOZ AGREED IN ITS </p><p>MARCH 2 SETTLEMENT WITH GUBBAY TO REFRAIN FROM ATTACKING </p><p>JUSTICES THROUGH GOZ-CONTROLLED MEDIA (WE DOUBT THAT THE </p><p>GOZ WILL HONOR THIS AGREEMENT.)
