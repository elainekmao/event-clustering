<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000105 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR D, NEA/FO, NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA, IO/UNP </p><p>GENEVA FOR STONECIPHER </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR OFRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPOW, IZ, KU, ICRC </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) GULF WAR MISSING:  1/22 MEETING WILL BE THE </p><p>TEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 KUWAIT 5611 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION:  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and </p><p>Iraq held a meeting of the Technical Sub-Committee (TSC) of </p><p>the Tripartite Commission on Gulf War POWs and Missing (TPC) </p><p>January 8 in Amman, Jordan.  The process got off to a </p><p>reasonably constructive start but will only begin to tackle </p><p>substance at the next meeting, in Amman on January 22.  At </p><p>that time, the parties are to discuss specific cases, </p><p>respecting the previously-agreed quotas.  They also agreed to </p><p>identify in advance which cases to discuss, selecting the </p><p>ones most likely to yield results, with input from the </p><p>investigating party.  Areas of disagreement remain:  Iraq </p><p>refuses to hold subsequent meetings at the border, and the </p><p>Kuwaitis refuse to meet in Baghdad or Kuwait City, but Riyadh </p><p>remains a possible venue.  Kuwait wants TSC meetings every </p><p>two weeks through mid-April, whereas Iraq wants 3 weeks </p><p>between meetings to allow more time for preparation.  In the </p><p>face of heavy media interest, the parties respected the </p><p>confidentiality required by the Rules of Procedure.  END </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) PolChief discussed the January 8 TSC meeting with </p><p>ICRC Regional Representative Michel Meyer and, separately, </p><p>with Rabea al-Adsani, Director General of Kuwait\'s National </p><p>Committee for Missing and POW Affairs (NCMPA), both of whom </p><p>participated in the Amman meeting.  Both assessed that the </p><p>process had gotten off to a reasonably constructive start. </p><p>Meyer added that the atmosphere warmed during the meeting, so </p><p>that by the end, the Kuwaitis and Iraqis were speaking to </p><p>each other during breaks, and even shook hands on parting. </p><p>That said, both Meyer and Adsani acknowledged that it is not </p><p>yet possible to judge whether Iraq is serious about making </p><p>substantive progress, because the meeting -- the first in </p><p>over four years -- was strictly procedural.  The test will </p><p>come on January 22, when the parties are to discuss specific </p><p>cases.  These cases are to be selected on the basis of being </p><p>especially promising, i.e. cases for which the investigating </p><p>party has material information.  At Kuwait\'s suggestion, the </p><p>investigating party is to propose certain cases; this is an </p><p>attempt to avoid past problems in which the submitting party </p><p>raises a case, only to be told the other side has no </p><p>information on it. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Adsani explained that he was extremely busy because </p><p>January 13 is the date by which all three countries, in their </p><p>capacity as investigating parties, are to provide ICRC their </p><p>selected cases for half the quotas.  (NOTE:  as previously </p><p>agreed, the quotas (maximum numbers of cases) for any TSC </p><p>meeting are:  24 Kuwaiti cases, 10 Iraqi cases, and 6 Saudi </p><p>cases, for a total of 40.  Under the new arrangement, by </p><p>January 13 Iraq is to select 12 Kuwaiti and 3 Saudi cases; </p><p>Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are to select between them 5 Iraqi </p><p>cases.  Kuwait will select 3 of the 5, Saudi the other 2 (out </p><p>of a total of 102 Iraqi cases that have been submitted to the </p><p>TSC:  68 submitted to Kuwait, 34 to Saudi Arabia). </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) By January 15, Adsani continued, the submitting </p><p>parties are to respond to these proposed selections, either </p><p>approving them or substituting different cases.  Thus, on </p><p>January 22 all parties should be prepared to delve into the </p><p>substance of the most promising cases.  That, according to </p><p>Adsani, will be the litmus test of Iraq\'s intentions. </p><p>Adsani assured that Kuwait will be able to show real progress </p><p>on at least 3 Iraqi cases, which it continued to work on over </p><p>the past four years even though Iraq was boycotting the </p><p>entire TPC process. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) As reported reftel, Kuwait wanted to hold a total of </p><p>seven TSC meetings before the next TPC meeting April 16, and </p><p>wanted most of the sessions to take place on the border, </p><p>partly because this would make it easier to bring witnesses </p><p>to testify before the TSC.  The Iraqis did not accept to meet </p><p>at either border (Kuwaiti or Saudi), claiming that US </p><p>military action has cut off communication links between the </p><p>border and Baghdad, but their delegation head gave assurances </p><p>that it would bring witnesses to whatever venue was selected. </p><p> Interestingly, it was Iraq that proposed holding subsequent </p><p>TSC meetings in the respective capitals.  According to Meyer, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the Kuwaiti delegation said it was not empowered to make a </p><p>decision on that; Adsani subsequently told PolChief that it </p><p>is "out of the question" to meet in Baghdad or Kuwait City. </p><p>The GOK has no objection to Riyadh if the Saudis accept, but </p><p>there is no ICRC office there, and according to Meyer, the </p><p>Iraqis only agreed to meet at ICRC premises. </p><p>6.  (C) Kuwait pressed for follow-up TSC meetings every two </p><p>weeks, but the Iraqis wanted three weeks between meetings, to </p><p>allow more time for preparation.  Thus, the only thing that </p><p>has been decided regarding future meetings is to hold the </p><p>next one in Amman on January 22.  Adsani said he suggested </p><p>holding one meeting in Geneva piggy-backing on the worldwide </p><p>conference on missing persons that ICRC is hosting February </p><p>19-21.  (NOTE:  We understand the USG is invited to that </p><p>conference and will send a delegation from Washington.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  Adsani said he also suggested holding a TSC meeting </p><p>in Geneva just before the April 16 TPC, in hopes that this </p><p>might entice the Iraqis to attend the TPC rather than </p><p>participate remotely as they did December 18. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Meyer noted that the January 8 meeting drew heavy </p><p>media attention.  He estimated that between 50 and 100 </p><p>reporters, photographers and cameramen staked out the ICRC </p><p>office.  He noted approvingly that despite the media crush, </p><p>the parties respected the confidentiality of the substance of </p><p>the TSC meeting, as required by the Rules of Procedure. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  The Iraqis garnered favorable publicity </p><p>just by participating in the January 8 meeting.  Given the </p><p>confidentiality rule, it should be easy for them to continue </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to reap p.r. benefits without acting in good faith, but </p><p>thanks to Kuwait\'s ingenious suggestion to have the </p><p>investigating party propose some cases, the January 22 </p><p>meeting should provide a strong indication of whether Baghdad </p><p>has any intention of making progress towards resolving any of </p><p>these humanitarian cases.  For our part, we have already laid </p><p>down the marker that extension of the temporary rule </p><p>suspension under which the TSC is meeting depends on it </p><p>yielding substantive results. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
