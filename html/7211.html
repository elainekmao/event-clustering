<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000439 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Human Rights, ASSK, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: REGIME EASES UP ON ASSK HARASSMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: NLD spokesman U Lwin told Poloff on April </p><p>7 that ASSK and party were harassed by SPDC and local </p><p>authorities representatives for the first few days of their </p><p>visit to Chin State.  However, Military Intelligence (MI) </p><p>officials, who provided earlier assurances that there would </p><p>be no such harassment, have apparently stepped in to prevent </p><p>further incidents.  The sequence of events indicates that the </p><p>SPDC is still working out how best to manage relations with </p><p>the NLD within Senior General Than Shwe\'s overarching </p><p>hard-line policy.  End Summary. </p><p>2. (SBU)  In spite of the authorities, efforts to prevent </p><p>people from turning out for ASSK as she traveled through </p><p>Magwe Division to Chin State, NLD spokesman U Lwin told </p><p>Poloff that large crowds chose to risk official threats of </p><p>"serious consequences" to greet her.  He cited as an example, </p><p>a town in Chin State in which the community turned out in a </p><p>silent candle vigil along the roadside to welcome ASSK and </p><p>her party as they arrived late at night.  According to U </p><p>Lwin, harassment during the first four days of the visit </p><p>included the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- local authorities played loud recordings of Buddhist </p><p>prayers and sermons denouncing ASSK as an enemy and stating </p><p>that she was unwelcome; </p><p> </p><p>-- the Minister of Information and Deputy Ministers of Home </p><p>Affairs, Religious Affairs, and Mines visited the area just </p><p>ahead of ASSK telling their local employees and other </p><p>residents along her route to stay home during her visit. </p><p>They threatened serious actions against any employees and </p><p>their families who showed support for the NLD, noting that </p><p>videotapes would be taken to identify those who turned out to </p><p>see ASSK; </p><p> </p><p>-- the Deputy Minister for Mines told his Ministry\'s </p><p>employees that there would be no dialogue with the NLD or </p><p>transfer of power (Note: This echoes similar remarks </p><p>attributed to Secretary Two Lt. General Soe Win at a USDA </p><p>gathering in Pyay about two months ago.  End Note); </p><p> </p><p>--  local authorities believed to be USDA members used </p><p>abusive language to disburse crowds gathering to meet ASSK </p><p>and threatened actions against locals painting signs wishing </p><p>ASSK good health. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)    U Lwin said he reported these abuses as he </p><p>learned of them to the NLD\'s MI liaison, Brigadier General </p><p>Than Tun, who had earlier provided assurances to U Lwin and </p><p>ASSK personally that there would be no such harassment on </p><p>this trip.  U Lwin told Poloff that Than Tun appeared </p><p>genuinely surprised that the harassment was occurring, and </p><p>that it was being directed by SPDC Ministers and Deputy </p><p>Ministers.  A turning point apparently came on April 6, </p><p>according to U Lwin, when election committee authorities </p><p>(under the Ministry of Home Affairs) in Haka, the capitol of </p><p>Chin State, refused to allow ASSK to open the NLD office </p><p>there.  Prior to the trip, MI had agreed to allow ASSK to </p><p>open six NLD offices during her trip, including the office in </p><p>Haka.  U Lwin said he reported the incident to MI at noon and </p><p>within 15 minutes, the NLD party in Haka called to tell him </p><p>they had received word that they could open the office. </p><p>Since that time, U Lwin told Poloff, the harassment of ASSK </p><p>and her party appears to have ended, and she opened another </p><p>township office early on April 7 without incident. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Comment: Although ASSK will be traveling for </p><p>approximately five more days and more harassment could occur, </p><p>U Lwin appeared hopeful that MI has now stepped in to ensure </p><p>the rest of the trip goes smoothly.  The SPDC\'s handling of </p><p>the trip highlights continuing internal differences on how </p><p>best to handle relations with the NLD.  The dispatching of </p><p>the Minister of Information and several Deputy Ministers to </p><p>the area to whip up public sentiment against ASSK and </p><p>threaten those interested in turning out to see her is </p><p>consistent with the hard-line that Senior General Than Shwe </p><p>appears to have laid down on no dialogue or power sharing </p><p>with ASSK.  These actions indicate little interest in </p><p>pursuing the non-confrontational relations between the SPDC </p><p>and NLD that Special Envoy Razali has tried to nurture since </p><p>late 2000.  However, MI appears to be pursuing a less harsh </p><p>approach, perhaps hoping to avoid negative international </p><p>press such as that received after the harassment of ASSK on </p><p>her Rakhine trip late last year.  While MI must conform to </p><p>the Senior General\'s overall hard-line stance, its efforts to </p><p>coordinate ASSK\'s travel, even if only to avoid bad press, </p><p>provide her the opportunity to continue to rebuild the party </p><p>structure and patiently but consistently push for democratic </p><p>reform. End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
