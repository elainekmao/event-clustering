<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004196 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT CIRCULAR ON ARMENIAN "GENOCIDE" SEEN AS </p><p>ANTI-REFORM EFFORT </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Turkish Education Ministry has urged all </p><p>fifth- and seventh-graders to write an essay arguing that </p><p>allegations that the Ottomans committed genocide against </p><p>Armenians are "baseless."  The Ministry also asked schools to </p><p>organize conferences on the issue, and seven teachers have </p><p>been indicted for comments made during one such conference. </p><p>Our contacts, both in and outside the GOT, are mostly </p><p>embarrassed by these measures, but the chairman of the </p><p>parliamentary Human Rights Committee defended the essays. </p><p>Academics and human rights activists said they believe the </p><p>military-dominated National Security Council (NSC) is behind </p><p>the measures.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Students Urged to Write About "Baseless" Allegations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Education Minister Celik in April issued a circular </p><p>urging all schools in Turkey to have their fifth- and </p><p>seventh-graders prepare a one-page essay arguing that the </p><p>allegations that Turkey committed genocide against Armenians </p><p>are "baseless."  The essays have been submitted to the </p><p>Education Ministry, which will review them and announce in </p><p>September the winners of the national competition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Armenian Schools Ignoring Contest </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Turkey\'s Armenian schools were included in the </p><p>distribution of the circular.  However, Hrant Dink, editor of </p><p>the Istanbul-based Armenian newspaper Agos, told us the </p><p>Armenian schools are not participating in the voluntary essay </p><p>competition.  Still, he said, knowledge of the competition is </p><p>a kind of "psychological torture" for Turkish Armenians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Teachers Arrested at Conference </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The circular also asked schools to organize </p><p>conferences on the "baseless" allegations.  At one such </p><p>conference, seven teachers were arrested June 2 in the </p><p>southeastern province of Kilis when one teacher, Hulya </p><p>Akpinar, got into a dispute with the speaker and was joined </p><p>by six others when she walked out in protest.  Prosecutors </p><p>have indicted the seven teachers, and accuse Akpinar of </p><p>claiming during the conference that the Ottoman State had </p><p>massacred 800,000 Armenians as part of a deliberate policy. </p><p>According to press reports, however, the dispute began after </p><p>Akpinar asked the speaker whether the GOT had a policy on how </p><p>it would respond if the Armenian lobby managed to persuade </p><p>many countries to accept the genocide allegations.  Akpinar </p><p>has reportedly been dismissed from her job. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Parliamentary and GOT Reactions Mixed </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We have raised concerns about the circular and the </p><p>indictment with a number of GOT contacts and other public </p><p>figures.  Most were visibly embarrassed by the issue, but </p><p>Mehmet Elkatmis, president of the parliamentary Human Rights </p><p>Committee, defended the measures.  Elkatmis argued that the </p><p>Education Minister "did the right thing" by encouraging </p><p>students to "study" the Armenian accusations.  When we noted </p><p>that the circular required students to reach a specific </p><p>conclusion, Elkatmis argued that was justified, given the </p><p>GOT\'s policy on the issue.  Elkatmis further averred that the </p><p>arrest of the teachers was "not an international incident" </p><p>and noted that the teachers were "only under investigation" </p><p>and that none remained in detention.  (Note: It was clear to </p><p>us that Elkatmis had not been aware of the issue; his </p><p>responses were prompted by an advisor who whispered in his </p><p>ear.  End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) However, Koksal Toptan, chairman of the parliamentary </p><p>Justice Committee, said the circular and the indictment </p><p>reflect the fact that human rights reform in Turkey is </p><p>incomplete.  "We have deficiencies in implementation (of </p><p>reforms)," he said.  "There is no question about that." </p><p>Toptan predicted that the charges against the teachers will </p><p>be dropped.  Abdulkadir Kaya, Justice Ministry Director </p><p>General for International Relations, called the indictment of </p><p>the teachers "stupid, unacceptable," but said the Justice </p><p>Ministry does not have the authority to intervene in the </p><p>case.  "We are stuck with it for now," he lamented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Others Blame NSC and Reform Opponents </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Prominent political reformer and civil society </p><p>activist Berna Turkili, pointing to what she called the </p><p>"Soviet-like" line on her identity card listing religion, </p><p>sees the contest as a reflection of continuing paranoia on </p><p>the part of an Establishment which wants to keep Turkey </p><p>anchored in the revolutionary nationalist fervor of the </p><p>Republic\'s initial period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Suavi Aydin, Hacettepe University anthropology </p><p>professor and expert on Anatolian minorities; Baskin Oran, </p><p>Ankara University international relations professor; and </p><p>Yavuz Onen, Human Rights Foundation chairman, all told us </p><p>they blame the NSC for the measures (Note: We have no </p><p>information confirming NSC involvement.  End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) "There is no way the Education Minister did this on </p><p>his own," Aydin claimed.  Aydin argued that the circular is a </p><p>reaction by establishmentarian elements of the State opposed </p><p>to human rights reform and EU membership.  These elements </p><p>seek to delay the reform process by pumping life into </p><p>traditional Turkish paranoia over issues such as Armenian </p><p>genocide allegations, Cyprus, and relations with Greece, he </p><p>said.  Onen believes the circular has two purposes: 1) to </p><p>warn the GOT against any effort to radically change policies </p><p>toward Armenia, and 2) to ensure that the next generation of </p><p>Turks accepts the State view of the genocide allegations. </p><p>Oran characterized the circular as a typically clumsy effort </p><p>by the Establishment, and predicted the backlash will </p><p>actually prove beneficial.  "We have to thank the opposition </p><p>(to reform) for being stupid," he said.  Public reaction to </p><p>the arrest of the teachers will generate more open debate </p><p>about the genocide allegations, and relations with Armenia, </p><p>just as the GOT\'s crackdown on Kurdish cultural expression </p><p>has broadened the debate on the Kurdish issue, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Editor of intellectual center-left "Radikal" Ismet </p><p>Berkan, whose wife is of Armenian descent and whose May 15 </p><p>column sharply criticized the essay contest, differed on the </p><p>contest\'s origin.  Responding to our comment that Education </p><p>Minister Celik (from Van, which had a sizable Armenian </p><p>population until 1915) has long been a contributor to the </p><p>genocide denial camp, Berkan averred that the stimulus for </p><p>the contest came from lower-level retrograde Ministry </p><p>officials trying to curry favor with Celik. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Turkish authorities have long made legal arguments </p><p>for rejecting the term "genocide," and otherwise handled the </p><p>question in a short-sighted, hyper-defensive manner, for </p><p>example by issuing counter accusations of an Armenian </p><p>"genocide" of Turks.  More and more Turks appear to us to </p><p>have an inkling of what happened on both sides, and have </p><p>begun to argue that this issue should be left for historians. </p><p> It is reprehensible, therefore, to ask young students to </p><p>take on this burden, especially considering that Turkish </p><p>textbooks provide nothing but propaganda on the question. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
