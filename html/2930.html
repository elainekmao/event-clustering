<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001139 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND SCHLACHTER, </p><p>AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ZIM/FRENCH ELECTIONS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Europe\'s double standards exposed" the </p><p>   government-controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail" dedicated </p><p>   its May 12 editorial to stating that circumstances </p><p>   surrounding the outcome of the French election are no </p><p>   different from the disputed presidential poll in Zimbabwe. </p><p>   Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .The just-ended presidential elections in France </p><p>   made it very clear for everyone to see Europe\'s double </p><p>   standards.  In the elections. . .President Chirac won </p><p>   over 82 percent of the votes against Le Pen\'s 18 </p><p>   percent.  What is interesting in the elections is the </p><p>   way the whole of Europe united in making sure that Le </p><p>   Pen loses the elections.  Even the French media united </p><p>   in making sure that Le Pen, who they consider to be </p><p>   threat to their country\'s interests, loses the </p><p>   elections. </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .By fighting to make sure that Le Pen loses, the </p><p>   people of France were defending their country\'s </p><p>   interests and what they did is exactly what the people </p><p>   of Zimbabwe did when they voted for President Mugabe. . </p><p>   .   Mr. Tsvangirai is Zimbabwe\'s version of France\'s Le </p><p>   Pen.  While the French describe Le Pen as a \'xenophobic </p><p>   candidate,\' Zimbabweans describe Mr. Tsvangirai as a </p><p>   \'sellout. . .\'  It has been said before that Americans </p><p>   would not salute Osama Bin Laden if he wins elections in </p><p>   their country and surely there is nothing wrong when </p><p>   Zimbabweans say a British-sponsored party will never </p><p>   rule in Zimbabwe. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
