<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000768 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, ASEC, EPET, ENRG, ECON, PINS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DISGRUNTLED OIL WORKERS HOLD </p><p>17 AMERICAN HOSTAGES </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Since April 16, disgruntled Nigerian oil </p><p>service workers have held hostage as many as 97 </p><p>expatriates, including 23 U.S.-citizens on four </p><p>offshore oil rigs beyond the eastern Niger Delta. </p><p>Transocean Sedco Forex, a Houston-based, Cayman </p><p>Island-registered oil service company, operates the </p><p>rigs. As of April 29, company officials report 6 U.S. </p><p>citizens were released, leaving 17 on the rigs. Post </p><p>is actively monitoring the situation and encouraging </p><p>the GON and labor organizations to find a negotiated </p><p>solution to the stand-off. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The company\'s managing director in Nigeria, Ian </p><p>Clarke, told the Ambassador that on April 16, about </p><p>100 disgruntled oil workers took over four oil rigs </p><p>(Sedco 709, Trident 6 & 8 and NG Holme) to protest the </p><p>dismissal of five workers accused of theft. He said a </p><p>total of 372 persons were on the four platforms at the </p><p>time of the incident, including 97 foreign workers. </p><p>Clarke said 23 were U.S. citizens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Clarke later told Econoff that as of the evening of </p><p>April 29, his company had negotiated the release of 6 </p><p>U.S citizens, leaving 17 on the rigs. Of the </p><p>approximately 272 hostages taken, 32 have been </p><p>released, leaving 240 on the rigs, in addition to the </p><p>100 disgruntled oil workers turned captors. Clarke </p><p>reported that the released hostages are in good health </p><p>and that the situation on the platform was calm. He </p><p>added that the remaining hostages are in no immediate </p><p>danger and have sufficient quantities of food and </p><p>water. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The disgruntled workers are all member of the </p><p>National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers </p><p>(NUPENG); however, NUPENG opposes this wildcat </p><p>takeover. Joseph Akinlaja, General Secretary of </p><p>NUPENG, told Poloff on April 28 that the Transocean </p><p>Sedco Forex workers were dismissed a few days before </p><p>the April 16 takeover for theft of company property. </p><p>The company obtained a Federal High Court order </p><p>demanding the accused workers vacate the premises; </p><p>however, co-workers of the employees prevented the </p><p>bailiff from serving the court documents. Akinlaja </p><p>said that shortly thereafter, about 70 coworkers and </p><p>fellow NUPENG members began a solidarity protest in </p><p>support of the dismissed workers and eventually blocked </p><p>the platforms\' helicopter landing pads. Akinlaja said </p><p>his office declined a request by the aggrieved workers </p><p>for NUPENG\'s intervention and emphasized that "NUPENG </p><p>will not support such irresponsible acts by any of its </p><p>members." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment: Transocean Sedco Forex officials continue </p><p>to negotiate with the disgruntled employees turned </p><p>captors; however, the company\'s position is that </p><p>negotiations should take place in Port Harcourt, not </p><p>on the oil rigs. The employees fear that if they </p><p>abandon their positions they will be fired. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Labor disputes such as this erupt periodically at </p><p>oil facilities. Usually they are resolved peacefully </p><p>and without GON intervention. At this juncture, the </p><p>hostages appear to be in no imminent danger. This </p><p>takeover, although discomforting, seems no different </p><p>than the others that have ended without incidents of a </p><p>violent nature. In his conversation with the Ambassador, </p><p>Clarke emphasized that no threats of violence had been </p><p>made by the offedning Nigerian employees. There has been </p><p>no destruction of property </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Transocean Sedco Forex Managing Director Ian Clarke </p><p>will meet the Ambassador on April 30 to discuss avenues </p><p>for peaceful resolution of the dispute, including the </p><p>involvement of the Ministry of Labour, National Labour </p><p>Congress (the national labor organization of which </p><p>NUPENG is a member), and NUPENG. It is positive that </p><p>the leadership of NUPENG has disassociated itself from </p><p>what amounts to an illegal strike. Additionally, </p><p>NUPENG leadership may be helpful in talking down the </p><p>local members involved. For now, the GON, including the </p><p>National Security Agency, is also monitoring the situation </p><p>and does not appear ready to become actively involved </p><p>unless requested by Transocean Sedco Forex. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
