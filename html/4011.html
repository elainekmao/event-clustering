<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002871 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OPDAT--SILVERWOOD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/17/2017 </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PGOV, KJUS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION\'S PROGRESS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY:  The two year-old Independent Corrupt </p><p>Practices and Related Offenses Commission (ICPC) recently </p><p>obtained its first conviction of a public official under the </p><p>2000 Anti-Corruption law.  The number of ICPC cases under </p><p>investigation or submitted to courts for prosecution has </p><p>doubled in the last six months thanks in large measure to new </p><p>staff and USG-provided training.  Additional funding is </p><p>needed to expand the Commission,s work outside of Abuja; </p><p>this will be a key indicator of GON support for a sustained </p><p>anti-corruption drive.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) During an October 11 meeting with RNLEO, Ali Aku, the </p><p>Special Assistance to the Chairman of the ICPC, provided an </p><p>update on the Commission,s activities.  Aku disclosed the </p><p>Commission has 127 cases it is handling.  Court proceedings </p><p>have been completed in 10 cases (verdicts rendered in three; </p><p>decisions pending in the other seven).  19 cases are </p><p>currently in court or close to trial.  The remaining cases </p><p>are in various stages of investigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Aku allowed RNLEO to review some ICPC internal </p><p>documents on the status of current cases.  Police </p><p>investigators assigned to the Commission have done work in </p><p>100 cases.  The remaining 27 cases are deemed politically </p><p>sensitive, involving serving Governors or Police officials, </p><p>and are being investigated by agents of the State Security </p><p>Service (SSS) assigned to the Commission.  Nine state </p><p>Governors -- one fourth of the total -- are being </p><p>investigated for misappropriating state funds, according to </p><p>the documents.  These are the Governors of:  Kogi, Ondo, </p><p>Anambra, Niger, Zamfara, Bayelsa, Edo, Nassarawa and Lagos </p><p>states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First Three Prosecutions Concluded </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) The first three verdicts of ICPC prosecutions were </p><p>handed down by High Courts in the last month.  Aku </p><p>highlighted news of the Commission,s first conviction ) the </p><p>conviction of a Local Government Area (LGA) Chairman in Kogi </p><p>state for misappropriating state funds.  The LGA Chairman was </p><p>sentenced to three years in jail and fined 100,000 naira </p><p>(equivalent to USD 800), mandated by minimum sentencing </p><p>guidelines in the 2000 law.  The Commission had two other </p><p>cases that produced acquittals at the same time.  A High </p><p>Court Judge in Kano, charged with receiving bribes to </p><p>influence his judgments, was acquitted by a fellow Kano </p><p>judge.  Similarly, a separate Kano High Court judge acquitted </p><p>a LGA Chairman of Kano State charged with misappropriation of </p><p>government funds.  Aku stated the  Commission is appealing </p><p>both decisions and he blamed the acquittals on corruption </p><p>among the judges handling the cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shooting High </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(S) Documents produced by Aku revealed that the Commission </p><p>is investigating the President and Vice President for alleged </p><p>corruption related to contracts.  The Commission is also </p><p>investigating Speaker of the House, Ghali Umar Na,Abba, for </p><p>corruption.  News of the latter investigation appeared </p><p>recently in the local press, prompting angry outbursts from </p><p>the Speaker, a letter from him to the ICPC Chairman demanding </p><p>an explanation, and an injunction he filed against the ICPC. </p><p>Na,Abba,s theatrics notwithstanding, the Commission </p><p>continues the investigation, according to Aku.  (Note: All </p><p>members of the National Assembly, like the Governors, Vice </p><p>President and President, are immune from prosecution under </p><p>the 2000 Corruption Act, but only so long as they hold </p><p>office; once out of office, they can be prosecuted for prior </p><p>crimes.  End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New Staff to Build Capacity </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) The Commission has had to delay and modify its </p><p>recruitment of additional staff originally planned for </p><p>December 2002, Aku disclosed.  The unresolved FY02 GON budget </p><p>impasse, which allows for the disbursement of only 50% of </p><p>agencies, funds, has forced the Commission to delay the </p><p>recruitment until the first or second quarter of 2003.  To </p><p>save funds, the Commission will not have a new testing and </p><p>interviewing process for candidates, but rather will draw </p><p>from the list of 1,000 (out of 27,000) candidates that passed </p><p>the 2001 exam and were interviewed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Aku relayed expressions of gratitude from the ICPC </p><p>Chairman, Justice Mustapha Akanbi, for the continued USG </p><p>support to the Commission in the form of INL-funded training </p><p>provided by DOJ,s Overseas Prosecutorial Development, </p><p>Assistance and Training (OPDAT) Program and the U.S. </p><p>Treasury,s Office of Technical Assistance (OTA).  Aku stated </p><p>that the Commission is ready to received the third phase of </p><p>OPDAT/OTA training ) to focus on advance criminal </p><p>investigative procedures ) in November.  A fourth phase in </p><p>December or January will offer select ICPC investigators or </p><p>instructors a comparative exchange with Hong Kong,s </p><p>Anti-Corruption Commission.  RNLEO queried Aku about a recent </p><p>press report that quoted ICPC Chairman Akanbi as expressing </p><p>appreciation for the provision of USD 300 million in </p><p>assistance to the Commission by an unidentified foreign </p><p>donor.  Aku laughed, explaining that the figure was a </p><p>misquote and meant to be USD 300,000 and the donor to whom </p><p>the Chairman was referring was OPDAT/OTA and INL but the </p><p>Chairman has difficulty citing correctly the several long </p><p>names of USG agencies involved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) If the Commission could actively move on its </p><p>high-profile cases in a non-partisan manner, it might begin </p><p>to silence criticism that it is a tooth-less body lacking the </p><p> bite to bring senior-level officials to justice, unless at </p><p>the behest of the Presidency.  The conviction of a LGA </p><p>Chairman is a symbolic first step.  Nigeria,s 774 Local </p><p>Government Areas receive significant federal funds for local </p><p>development but corruption at this level is serious.  A key </p><p>test of the President,s and National Assembly,s commitment </p><p>to a sustained, serious anti-corruption drive will be whether </p><p>the Commission is provided the critical funding to open and </p><p>staff its new zonal offices, so that the Commission can </p><p>really take its anti-corruption campaign outside of Abuja. </p><p>So far, Chairman Akanbi has succeeding in blocking attempts </p><p>to politicize the Commission, though there is an effort by </p><p>those involved in the current Presidential impeachment </p><p>contest to use the Commission for political ends, and this </p><p>includes accusations against the Chairman himself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
