<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000135 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, EAIR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AIR ZIM STRIKE OVER, BUT LITTLE RELIEF EXPECTED FOR </p><p>OTHER GOVT WORKERS </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: A GOZ compromise and end to the high-profile </p><p>strike by Air Zimbabwe engineers offers little spillover for </p><p>other disgruntled government workers.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Press reports indicate that the four-month strike of Air </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s engineers\' has been resolved after the GOZ </p><p>"intervened and met their demands."  Although Air Zim had </p><p>suspended the 140 engineers without pay and benefits, the </p><p>terms of the new agreement indicate that the GOZ has acceded </p><p>to or exceeded all of the engineers\' demands:  increases of </p><p>the basic salary to Z$200,000 - $430,000 monthly (about </p><p>US$135 - $289 at the fluctuating parallel rate), a 15 </p><p>percent "critical allowance," and full back-pay of all wages </p><p>and benefits while the engineers were on strike.  Tellingly, </p><p>one engineer stated that this was "a good starting point" </p><p>which should be open to continuing dialogue, since most of </p><p>the gains have already been eroded by inflation. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>3.  While news of the "breakthrough" in the engineers\' </p><p>strike might suggest a weakening in the GOZ\'s position </p><p>toward labor in general, several factors indicate that this </p><p>translates into little relief for domestic sectors.  First, </p><p>the Air Zim situation is high profile -- the safe operation </p><p>of the national airline is a strategic issue.  Every time </p><p>the safety of Air Zim equipment is called into question, the </p><p>GOZ looks bad.  Second, the cost of a continued strike was </p><p>expensive.  The GOZ was reduced to sending the aircraft to </p><p>neighboring countries for routine service, or hiring South </p><p>African or other regional engineering crews who would simply </p><p>refuse to service the aircraft and leave (as did the SA </p><p>engineers recently) if pay was not forthcoming.  Third, the </p><p>money demanded by the relief engineers had to be paid in </p><p>forex, since the regional substitutes would not accept </p><p>payment in Zim dollars, further straining the forex </p><p>situation.  All things considered, the cost of meeting the </p><p>Air Zim engineers\' demands was ultimately cheaper than </p><p>limping along without them, even though Air Zim officials </p><p>tell us they only need 60 percent of the engineers at </p><p>present service levels. </p><p> </p><p>4.  It does not seem likely that local employees or local </p><p>concerns -- such as the teachers or nurses -- will benefit </p><p>from similar considerations.   There is less immediate </p><p>damage if the educational system in underfunded, and the GOZ </p><p>is not sourcing forex in order to pay replacements. </p><p>Healthcare workers might benefit more from factors similar </p><p>to those affecting the airplane engineers, but not much. </p><p>The high-profile PR ploy of bringing in MDs from Cuba does </p><p>cost more money than increasing pay for local MDs (pay in </p><p>forex along with expensive "home leave" annually), which </p><p>could tip the balance for the doctors.  However, the GOZ is </p><p>not really doing much to replace the other unhappy medical </p><p>personnel, such as X-ray techs, lab techs, nurses and </p><p>pharmacists. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
