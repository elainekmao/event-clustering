<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KISL, IZ, JO, OIC </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: DEMARCHE TO OIC ON IRAQ ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 55532 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  A/DCM covered ref points on the Iraq discussion at </p><p>the OIC summit with Ali al-Ayed, personal assistant to </p><p>Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher.  A/DCM emphasized that UNSCR </p><p>1441 found Iraq in material breach and that Iraq must comply </p><p>immediately and fully with 1441.  It is also crucial that any </p><p>OIC statement send the clear message that the only way for </p><p>Iraq to avoid serious consequences is to comply immediately, </p><p>actively, and unconditionally with 1441.  Ayed noted that </p><p>Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb and Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaher Bak would represent Jordan in Doha. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Al-Ayed called back March 5 to report that the U.S. </p><p>perspective had been well aired in the OIC discussions in </p><p>Doha.  In fact, he said with some glee, the Kuwaiti and Iraqi </p><p>representatives had gotten into a heated exchange on live TV, </p><p>with the Iraqi calling the Kuwaiti "kelb (dog) and worse." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
