<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004098 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/04/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, PTER, IZ, JO, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN ACTION ON IRAQI ASSETS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 186972 </p><p>     B. STATE 173353 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  According to a senior Jordanian finance </p><p>ministry official, the GOJ -- using an April 24 law under </p><p>which the GOJ took ownership of $463 million in funds frozen </p><p>in Iraqi bank accounts -- is working hard to reimburse </p><p>private Jordanians who have submitted claims for unpaid </p><p>deliveries of goods to Iraq before the new Parliament meets </p><p>July 15.  The ministry had not received Secretary Snow\'s </p><p>recent letter, but will examine it closely and reply.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Econ/C called on Finance Ministry Secretary General </p><p>Moh\'d Abu Hammour July 2 to discuss Jordan\'s actions and </p><p>intentions vis a vis official Iraqi assets frozen in </p><p>Jordanian banks.  Abu Hammour, who is the number two official </p><p>in the Ministry of Finance, said that he had not seen the </p><p>letter from Secretary Snow to Finance Minister Marto (ref a). </p><p> He read the letter carefully and said he would discuss it </p><p>with Minister Marto.  It was Jordan\'s highest priority, he </p><p>said, to comply with all UN Security Council resolutions. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Abu Hammour said that he had been put in charge of </p><p>the inter-ministerial technical committee that is </p><p>implementing the April 24 law (text of law emailed to </p><p>NEA/ARN) under which the Government of Jordan took ownership </p><p>of Iraqi assets frozen in Iraqi banks.  Other members of the </p><p>committee come from the Central Bank, Ministry of Industry </p><p>and Trade, Ministry of National Economy, and Ministry of </p><p>Planning.  Abu Hammour said the total amount of frozen assets </p><p>was JD 328 million ($463 million).  The funds were for the </p><p>most part held in commercial bank accounts in the name of </p><p>Iraqi embassy employees, not official GOI institutions or </p><p>high-level officials.  Nevertheless, it was clear that the </p><p>accounts had been managed on behalf of the Saddam Hussein </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Approximately, 60-70% of the frozen accounts were in </p><p>the Jordan National Bank, the Amman branch of the Rafidain </p><p>Bank, and the Housing Bank.  The remainder was spread among </p><p>smaller banks.  Abu Hammour said that the largest Jordanian </p><p>bank, the Arab Bank (of which he is a board member) did not </p><p>have any such accounts and had been careful to avoid doing </p><p>business with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Under the terms of the April 24 law, approximately </p><p>130 private Jordanians have submitted claims to the technical </p><p>committee for reimbursement out of the frozen funds.  These </p><p>claims amount to 60-70% of the JD 328 million total.  These </p><p>claims were for goods that had been delivered to Iraq under </p><p>the terms of the bilateral oil for goods protocol, but for </p><p>which payment had not been authorized by the Iraqi government </p><p>(acting through the embassy employees) before the accounts </p><p>were frozen at the start of the war.  The committee is moving </p><p>quickly to validate claims and make reimbursements before the </p><p>new Parliament comes into session July 15, after which he </p><p>feared political interference by deputies. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Abu Hammour also noted that the April 24 law </p><p>entitled the Central Bank of Jordan to submit claims against </p><p>the frozen funds.  However, it was Abu Hammour\'s feeling that </p><p>the CBJ\'s JD1.1 billion claim should be dealt with </p><p>multilaterally along with other official claims under Paris </p><p>Club procedures.  (Indeed, Abu Hammour was personally worried </p><p>-- please protect -- that paying private claims under the </p><p>April 24 law would expose the Jordanian government to claims </p><p>by a future Iraqi government.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  Comment.  As shown by Jordan\'s cooperation with the </p><p>Treasury-led interagency team that came to Amman to track </p><p>Iraqi assets, Abu Hammour is undoubtedly correct that Jordan </p><p>does not want to get on the wrong side of the United States </p><p>or UN resolutions on this subject.  It does not seem, </p><p>however, that the April 24 law has been examined in light of </p><p>the UNSCR 1483 requirement to turn frozen GOI funds over to </p><p>the Development Fund for Iraq.  The Jordanians might be able </p><p>to argue that the April 24 law constitutes a "prior judicial </p><p>judgment" under para 23(b) of the resolution (which the </p><p>Security Council approved May 22).  Post would be pleased to </p><p>facilitate further communications with the Jordanians on this </p><p>subject. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
