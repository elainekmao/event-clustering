<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003794 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE EUR, NEA AND PM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PREL, IZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: KDP\'S CONTINUED PRACTICE OF CHARGING FEES AT </p><p>BORDER THREATENS TO STALL EFFORTS TO FACILITATE FLOW OF </p><p>GOODS TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3731 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Recent reports that the KDP intends to continue </p><p>charging taxes/fees for goods crossing the Turkish-Iraqi </p><p>border threatens to stall our ability to facilitate the flow </p><p>of goods to Iraq and could hamper our overall reconstruction </p><p>efforts.   It is our understanding that CPA Ambassador Bremer </p><p>and other US officials in Iraq have called on all Iraqi </p><p>groups to implement a &tax holiday8 while we attempt to </p><p>devise a uniform plan for the entire country.  Despite this </p><p>request, GOT officials, Turkish businessmen and sources in </p><p>Iraq report that Kurdish groups continue to charge fees for </p><p>trucks coming across the border.  The local KDP </p><p>representative confirmed these reports June 9 and said the </p><p>KDP intends to continue the practice, although under a </p><p>slightly different formula.  (reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We view the KDP,s insistence on continuing charging </p><p>fees along the border as an unilateral move by one Iraqi </p><p>group that would appear to run counter to the CPA,s policy </p><p>of a &tax holiday8 and, if left unchecked, could threaten </p><p>our larger objective of increasing the flow of goods to Iraq. </p><p> While the local KDP rep assures us there are no fees on </p><p>World Food Program (WFP) shipments entering Iraq from Turkey, </p><p>WFP Ankara told us the WFP is required to pay the KDP $20 per </p><p>truck and that only aid shipments entering Iraq from Turkey </p><p>are subject to fees.  Last week, a truckers\' strike against </p><p>an attempt by the KDP to increase fees temporarily halted UN </p><p>shipments from Turkey to Iraq, as the Financial Times </p><p>reported.  While trucks carrying fuel and LPG via the Ground </p><p>Line of Communication (GLOC) between Turkey and Iraq </p><p>reportedly are presently not being charged fees, we have no </p><p>assurances this will not change down the road if Kurdish </p><p>groups continue to be permitted to implement their own fee </p><p>system.  Furthermore, we suspect that some GOT officials are </p><p>hiding behind the fee issue before agreeing to implement the </p><p>necessary procedures (including new import guidelines) that </p><p>will facilitate the flow of goods and services between Turkey </p><p>and Iraq.  As long as the Kurdish groups in the north </p><p>continue to &run8 an independent fee collection policy </p><p>along the border, we can expect the Turks to drag their feet </p><p>on implementing the steps they need to take to open up their </p><p>side of the border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Action request:  Embassy will continue to press the </p><p>GOT hard to open its border fully to two-way trade.  It is </p><p>already open to the flow of humanitarian assistance.  We </p><p>recommend that Washington agencies and the CPA continue to </p><p>press hard on senior KDP and other Iraqi leaders to implement </p><p>the &tax holiday8 plan.  If these groups resist, we </p><p>recommend that Washington consider instructing US officials </p><p>in Iraq to immediately assume administrative and security </p><p>control of the Turkish-Iraqi border crossings to ensure </p><p>proper implementation of Coalition policy. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
