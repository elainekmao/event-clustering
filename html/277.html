<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SHENYANG 01285 </p><p> </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS ELECTRONICALLY TO USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL/OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, CH </p><p>SUBJECT:  BACK TO SCHOOL -- NORTHEAST CHINA STREETS ARE </p><p>QUIET AS STUDENTS AND THEIR MOVEMENT RETURN TO CAMPUSES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  SHENYANG 01251, AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  LIFE IN THE NORTHEAST HAS BEEN DRIFTING </p><p>BACK TO NORMAL.  THERE HAS NOT BEEN A PUBLIC STUDENT </p><p>DEMONSTRATION SINCE MONDAY, MAY 29, WHEN SMALL BANDS OF </p><p>SHENYANG AND CHANGCHUN STUDENTS STAGED FUNERAL MARCHES </p><p>(WEARING WHITE HEADBANDS AND CARRYING WREATHS).  HARD </p><p>CORE GROUPS OF MORE COMMITTED ACTIVISTS CONTINUE THE </p><p>STRUGGLE AT SHENYANG\'S NORTHEAST UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY </p><p>AND CHANGCHUN\'S JILIN UNIVERSITY.  THE MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>STUDENTS ARE TURNING THEIR ATTENTION TO CLASSES WHILE </p><p>WAITING FOR SIGNALS FROM BEIJING STUDENTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>STUDENTS KEEP FLAMES BURNING ON CAMPUSES </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  STUDENTS ARE BEGINNING TO RETURN TO CLASSES IN THE </p><p>NORTHEAST.  OTHER THAN IN A FEW ISOLATED SCHOOLS -- </p><p>WHERE STUDENT LEADERS CONTINUE TO LEAD CLASS BOYCOTTS -- </p><p>CLASSROOMS ARE BEGINNING TO FILL UP WITH STUDENTS BACK </p><p>FROM BEIJING, BACK FROM LOCAL DEMONSTRATIONS, OR BACK </p><p>FROM HOME WHERE THEY SAT OUT THE MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING POCKETS OF ACTIVITY IS </p><p>SHENYANG\'S NORTHEAST UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (NEUT) </p><p>WHERE THE INDEPENDENT STUDENT UNION WAS MAKING DEMANDS </p><p>AS LATE AS YESTERDAY (JUNE 1) FOR ACCESS TO THE CAMPUS </p><p>RADIO STATION, A PROMISE OF NO RETRIBUTION AGAINST </p><p>STUDENT LEADERS OF THE MOVEMENT, THE DISMISSAL OF THE </p><p>HEAD OF THE STUDENT UNION WHO DID NOT SUPPORT THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS, AND THE REMOVAL FROM THE PARTY OF THOSE </p><p>STUDENT PARTY MEMBERS WHO DID NOT SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT. </p><p>THE INDEPENDENT STUDENT UNION HAS ALSO CALLED FOR A </p><p>CONTINUED BOYCOTT OF CLASSES UNTIL JUNE 20TH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  EVENING GATHERINGS OF NEARLY A THOUSAND PEOPLE AT </p><p>CHANGCHUN\'S JILIN UNIVERSITY TO HEAR THE LATEST VOA AND </p><p>BBC BROADCASTS AS TRANSLATED BY JILIN UNIVERSITY </p><p>STUDENTS ALSO CONTINUE.  IN SPITE OF THIS SPARK THAT </p><p>HAS NOT GONE OUT, THE UNIVERSITY HAS SEEN MORE AND MORE </p><p>STUDENTS RETURNING TO THEIR STUDIES. </p><p> </p><p>BACK TO BOOKS, WAIT AND SEE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  SHENYANG APPEARS QUIET, OTHER THAN THE ACTIVITY </p><p>AT NEUT.  BY MONDAY MORNING (MAY 29), LEAFLETS AND POSTERS </p><p>WERE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN IN TOWN OUTSIDE OF UNIVERSITY </p><p>WALLS.  THE LUXUN ACADEMY OF ART -- WHICH WAS A MAJOR </p><p>POINT OF INFORMATION DISSEMINATION TO THOUSANDS DAILY </p><p>VIA POSTERS CHANGED EVERY FEW HOURS -- HAS NOT SEEN </p><p>ANY ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AMERICAN TEACHERS IN DALIAN REPORTED THAT THERE </p><p>HAS NOT BEEN A DEMONSTRATION THERE SINCE MONDAY (MAY </p><p>29).  THE CHIEF ISSUE AT DALIAN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY </p><p>IS WHETHER SCHOOL WILL BE EXTENDED INTO AUGUST TO MAKE </p><p>UP FOR THE TIME LOST DUE TO THE STUDENT MARCHES.  IN </p><p>HARBIN (HEILONGJIANG), STUDENTS ARE SLOWLY RETURNING </p><p>TO CLASS.  ATTEMPTS BY STUDENT LEADERS THERE TO CONTINUE </p><p>CLASS BOYCOTTS HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  NORTHEAST STUDENTS -- WITH THE POSSIBLE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF NEUT -- SEEM TO BE MARKING TIME, WAITING </p><p>FOR A CUE FROM BEIJING STUDENTS.  FAILING THAT, SOME </p><p>LOOK FORWARD TO THE MEETING OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE </p><p>OF THE PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 20TH. </p><p>THE LIAONING UNIVERSITY STUDENT COMMITTEE, HOWEVER, </p><p>HAS TOLD ITS STUDENTS TO RETURN TO CLASS IN PREPARATION </p><p>FOR "THE NEXT STRUGGLE" AND FOR THE MEAN TIME TO </p><p>ANALYZE WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN\'T.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HARRIS </p><p></p></div>
