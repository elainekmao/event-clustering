<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000819 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EPET, YM, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESS PLAYS ON EXAGGERATED ECONOMIC FEARS, ROYG </p><p>PUNCHES BACK </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by A/DCM Ken McKune for reasons 1.5 b. and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: Grave economic consequences from the war in </p><p>Iraq have been predicted in both official and unofficial </p><p>Yemeni press. However, most of the articles have been based </p><p>on conjecture and faulty math. In response, ROYG officials </p><p>have been reinforcing positive economic news and developing </p><p>new trade and supply policies to assure the public that the </p><p>economy is stable. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Press reports in both the official and opposition </p><p>media have run several stories  projecting a severe negative </p><p>impact to the economy of Yemen from the war in Iraq. One </p><p>popular scenario predicts budget losses to the ROYG economy </p><p>if oil drops to $8 a barrel. Another, repeated frequently in </p><p>the English language press, is that the Ministry of Industry </p><p>and Trade has launched an initiative to fix the prices on </p><p>thirteen essential commodities. To counter this, the ROYG </p><p>officials have been promoting a new trade and supply policy, </p><p>making several statements affirming that there are no food </p><p>shortages, and announcing new oil finds. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>8 USD per Barrel of Oil ? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Dr. Muhammed Al-Maytami, a professor of Economics at </p><p>the University of Sanaa, published an article in Al-Hayat on </p><p>March 2nd that outlined three scenarios for Yemen if the </p><p>price of oil drops to 20, 18 and 8 USD a barrel.  According </p><p>to Dr. Al-Maytami\'s math, if oil drops below 20 USD per </p><p>barrel,  Yemen would likely lose 500 million USD a year. </p><p>However, his worst case scenario has oil dropping below 8 USD </p><p>per barrel,and Yemen losing 1.2 billion USD a year. The $1.2 </p><p>billion figure for loss has been repeated by al-Jazeera, </p><p>al-Thawra, al-Hayat and the Yemen Times, often without any </p><p>reference to the fact that this figure is based on an 8 USD </p><p>per barrel price. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) According to Dr. Al-Maytami, the sole strategy of the </p><p>U.S. war on Iraq was to protect oil prices and keep them </p><p>under twenty dollars a barrel.  In all three price scenarios, </p><p>implementation of the ROYG\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy would </p><p>be delayed because much of the money planned to finance this </p><p>project was to originate from oil revenue. While most </p><p>government officials stayed away from such speculation, Under </p><p>Secretary for Planning and Development  Mutahhar al-\'Abbasi </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>told Al-Hayat that Yemen\'s 4-5 percent growth rate could be </p><p>eliminated if the price of oil continues to fall, and added </p><p>that this loss could have a negative affect on the ability of </p><p>the ROYG to meet their poverty eradication goals. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: According to the World Bank statistics, </p><p>Yemen\'s budget is based on the price of oil being 21 dollars </p><p>a barrel. As this cable is written, oil is about 29 USD per </p><p>barrel. Therefore, the price can fall much farther without </p><p>significant harm to the ROYG\'s budget planning. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Price Fixing by the Ministry of Industry and Trade </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Claiming a crisis in foodstuffs and supplies, the </p><p>Yemen Times ran a story on April 6, repeated by several </p><p>internet news outlets, stating that the Ministry of Industry </p><p>and Trade had resorted to price fixing to control food </p><p>shortages.  Arab Bank Manager Mahdi Allawi told Pol/Econoff </p><p>that his business contacts were incredulous over the idea of </p><p>price fixing, and thought the ROYG was not powerful enough to </p><p>enforce such an economic agenda. He later confirmed that </p><p>there were no such price fixing plans by the ROYG. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Post obtained a copy of trade and supply proposal and </p><p>confirms that there are no subsidies or price restrictions </p><p>discussed in the plan. However, the Ministry of Industry and </p><p>Trade has been given authority to oversee production to </p><p>ensure that there are no food shortages. An Embssy FSN </p><p>recently traveled to Al-Jowf, a rural northern governorate, </p><p>and reports that he saw no food shortages.  Some businessmen </p><p>Pol/econoff have spoken with have reported that business is </p><p>indeed down because of the war, but there have been no </p><p>accounts of empty shelves and wide-spread hoarding of food by </p><p>Yemenis. Comment: While misrepresented, the new supply </p><p>proposal is most likely an effort to assure the average </p><p>citizen that the war will not drastically affect their </p><p>day-to-day lives. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>ROYG Pushes Economic Success Stories </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In an effort to get out in front of the dire </p><p>predictions, several government officials have reinforced </p><p>positive economic news. Prime Minister Ba Jammal affirmed on </p><p>several occasions that there were no food shortages in Yemen. </p><p> Later, Minister of Oil and Minerals Rashid Salih said his </p><p>ministry would soon declare new oil discoveries in Hadhramout </p><p>and Shabwah. On April 3, he told Yemen\'s Sabaa news agency </p><p>that "oil sales, navigation and even investments didn\'t get </p><p>affected by the war."  Reinforcing the message, Minister of </p><p>Trade and Industry Muhammed Uthman noted on several occasions </p><p>that food supplies were stable and even threatened to punish </p><p>those who raise prices to gain economic advantage as a result </p><p>of the war. </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) Comment: Economic worries over a significant drop in </p><p>oil prices and food shortages reflect greater concerns over </p><p>long-term economic stability in Yemen.  It is widely </p><p>understood that oil revenues account for approximately 35% of </p><p>GDP, although some of the articles referred to in this piece </p><p>claim that 95% of Government revenue comes from oil.  Many </p><p>Yemenis Pol/Econoff has spoken to, including several FSNs, </p><p>believe part of the U.S. strategy behind the war in Iraq is </p><p>securing cheap oil. Therefore articles that emphasize drastic </p><p>price drops in oil and the subsequent harm to the Yemeni </p><p>economy, however farfetched, are likely to resonate with the </p><p>average Yemeni citizen. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
