Stemming from reports of the widespread sale of </p><p>humanitarian food aid in Iraq, particularly in Baghdad </p><p>markets, members of USAID\'s Disaster Assistance Response </p><p>Team (DART) conducted a rapid survey at food markets in </p><p>Baghdad, Al Hillah, As Sulaymaniyah, and Arbil in an effort </p><p>to determine the reasons for and scale of these sales. </p><p>Since late-1990, Iraqis have become largely dependent on </p><p>food rations distributed through the country\'s Public </p><p>Distribution System (PDS).  Up to 60 percent of the Iraqi </p><p>population of 27 million is thought to depend entirely on </p><p>the food and non-food items distributed monthly through the </p><p>PDS.  The World Food Program (WFP) was given the mandate to </p><p>observe the food distribution process in Iraq, as well as </p><p>implement it on behalf of the Government of Iraq in the </p><p>northern three governorates.  Using a ration card system, </p><p>food and non-food items are distributed monthly to all </p><p>Iraqis through the PDS.  The first post-conflict ration </p><p>distribution began June 1, and appears to have been </p><p>successful.  Though difficult to estimate the total tonnage </p><p>of ration items present in each of the four markets </p><p>surveyed, numerous vendors are selling wheat flour in WFP </p><p>and USA marked bags.  Between 50 and 80 percent of the wheat </p><p>flour available in the four markets had the WFP/USA markings </p><p>on the bags.  Other items from the ration mix were also </p><p>found for sale in the markets, yet not to the extent of the </p><p>wheat flour. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The rapid survey found that most of the wheat flour </p><p>found in the local markets had originated with the ration </p><p>recipients themselves, collected by small-scale traders who </p><p>circulate through neighborhoods and purchase bags of wheat </p><p>flour (and other ration items).  The commodities collected </p><p>are then sold to local vendors and wholesalers who </p><p>consolidate the ration items and sell them in larger </p><p>quantities to mobile traders who move the goods to areas </p><p>paying a premium for the commodities.  Baghdad, where prices </p><p>are 20 percent higher than most other parts of the country, </p><p>is the primary destination.  Relative to other times of the </p><p>year, the quantity of wheat flour in the markets may be </p><p>elevated presently due the recent completion of the June PDS </p><p>ration distribution, residual stocks from extra rations </p><p>distributed before the conflict, the bumper wheat harvest in </p><p>Iraq this year, and the fact that wheat flour sales are more </p><p>common in the summer than winter due to spoilage.  A limited </p><p>degree of food commodity trading at the household level is </p><p>considered acceptable and generally expected, provided there </p><p>is no large-scale diversion or detrimental effects on the </p><p>health/nutritional status of the community.  Despite the </p><p>seeming prevalence of humanitarian food aid (particularly </p><p>wheat flour) in the markets of the four cities surveyed, </p><p>there is no indication of an organized, large-scale </p><p>diversion of food aid from the PDS for commercialization in </p><p>urban markets. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND RATIONS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Following the imposition of international sanctions in </p><p>August 1990, the Government of Iraq introduced a food </p><p>distribution system that included the country\'s 27 million </p><p>inhabitants.  Under the United Nations Oil-for-Food (OFF) </p><p>Program, introduced in 1996 and implemented in 1997, the </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT) has contracted and distributed </p><p>nearly 500,000 MT per month of food commodities through the </p><p>PDS.  The MOT manages all aspects of the distribution in </p><p>Southern and Central Iraq, while in the three northern </p><p>governorates of Dahuk, Arbil, and Sulaymaniyah WFP is </p><p>responsible for the internal transport, handling and </p><p>monitoring of the food distributions, in collaboration with </p><p>the Kurdish Regional Government\'s (KRG) Ministries of </p><p>Finance. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Under its current six-month emergency operation, WFP </p><p>plans to bring in about 2.2 million MT of food commodities </p><p>to Iraq, largely to support the PDS.  The first post-war </p><p>ration distribution began June 1, and appears to have been </p><p>successful.  The tonnage distributed is still being compiled </p><p>by the MOT.  The July distribution has been announced, and </p><p>MOT and WFP expect to have adequate resources for the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Using a ration card system, rations are distributed </p><p>monthly to all registered Iraqis.  In July, for example, </p><p>rations will include wheat flour, rice, sugar, tea, milk </p><p>powder, cooking oil, soap, detergent, and pulses (e.g. chick </p><p>peas).  Households with infants should also receive infant </p><p>formula, and a separate allotment of detergent, and soap. </p><p>Rations are distributed to final beneficiaries through a </p><p>network of food and flour agents (FAs), numbering </p><p>approximately 44,000 nationwide.  FAs sell rations to </p><p>beneficiaries at a nominal price.  The ration price in the </p><p>southern and central governorates is 250 Iraqi Dinars (ID) </p><p>(equiv. USD .18), while the price in the northern three </p><p>governorates is 2.5 Swiss Dinars (SD) (equiv. USD .41). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>SALE OF HUMANITARIAN RATIONS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Humanitarian food aid commodities, primarily bags of </p><p>wheat flour with WFP markings, for sale in commercial </p><p>markets have been observed by USAID DART members and others </p><p>over the last month, in addition to being reported in the </p><p>press.  DART Food Officers conducted rapid surveys at food </p><p>markets in Arbil, As Sulaymaniyah, Al Hillah, and Baghdad in </p><p>an effort to determine the reasons for and scale of these </p><p>sales. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In these four cities, numerous shops are selling wheat </p><p>flour in WFP and USA marked 45-50 kg bags.  Approximately 50- </p><p>75 percent of the wheat being sold in the Arbil and As </p><p>Sulaymaniyah markets was marked WFP or USA, while the </p><p>proportion of wheat flour being sold in one large Baghdad </p><p>market was estimated at 75 percent.  Wheat flour in Al </p><p>Hillah markets with the WFP/USA markings is estimated to be </p><p>over 80 percent of the total available observed for sale. </p><p>Other items from the ration mix were found for sale in the </p><p>markets, yet not to the extent of the wheat flour. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The sale of humanitarian food aid is a common occurrence </p><p>among vulnerable populations receiving food aid assistance, </p><p>such as refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). </p><p>Reasons for selling rations range from the ration being </p><p>inappropriately selected for local tastes, to the ration </p><p>being the recipient\'s sole economic or liquid asset.  A </p><p>limited degree of food commodity trading at the household </p><p>level is generally accepted by the international </p><p>humanitarian community, provided there is no large-scale </p><p>diversion or detrimental effects on the health/nutritional </p><p>status of the community.  Certain commodities may have a </p><p>potentially higher resale value, and the resale of these </p><p>commodities may allow beneficiaries to purchase other </p><p>essential food items - such as meat, fruits and vegetables - </p><p>that are not available through the ration. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Based on discussion with the beneficiaries of rations </p><p>distributed through the PDS in Iraq, rations are being sold </p><p>for one or more of the following reasons: people need money </p><p>to pay the fee to the food/flour agent for ration, they need </p><p>money to pay for other food items, or they need money to pay </p><p>for non-food items.  Very few interviewed indicated that </p><p>their household was sufficiently food secure or with </p><p>adequate disposable income such that they simply did not </p><p>need the rations.  Thus, excess food and non-food items at- </p><p>home is not thought to be a significant reason for sale of </p><p>rations.  In Arbil, for example, beneficiaries noted all </p><p>three reasons for selling parts of their rations.  Moreover, </p><p>ration quality reportedly varies by month, and rations of </p><p>sub-par quality are often sold in order to purchase higher </p><p>quality items, though at a lower quantity. </p><p> </p><p>10.  When asked, both merchants and customers in Al Hillah </p><p>accepted the sale of PDS commodities as a necessary coping </p><p>mechanism for many people who had no other real source of </p><p>income.  The sale of food aid intended for vulnerable </p><p>groups, however, triggered an angry reaction from both the </p><p>merchants and customers interviewed. Merchants reported </p><p>ambulances selling truckloads of biscuits and similar </p><p>stories of food meant for IDPs being sold by those trusted </p><p>with the distribution. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>SOURCE OF MARKETED FOOD AID </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Approximately 90 percent of the WFP/USA marked wheat </p><p>flour found in Arbil\'s local market is reportedly sourced </p><p>from the ration recipients.  In Al Hillah and As </p><p>Sulaymaniyah, vendors also indicated that the overwhelming </p><p>majority of PDS commodity sales were made by households who </p><p>needed the money to pay food agents for rations, or to </p><p>purchase other food or non-food items.  In Baghdad the </p><p>repeated explanation regarding the source of the WFP wheat </p><p>flour is that traders purchase directly from the </p><p>beneficiaries, or it is trucked in from outside the city. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Items distributed as rations are usually sourced for </p><p>the markets by small-scale traders (often boys or young men </p><p>with handcarts) who roam neighborhoods offering to buy the </p><p>rations from recipients.  Wheat flour is the most prevalent </p><p>item purchased, followed by vegetable oil and rice.  The </p><p>neighborhood collection seems to occur most vigorously soon </p><p>after a month\'s PDS distributions.  The small traders </p><p>purchase mainly unopened bags from beneficiaries.  These </p><p>small-scale traders then sell the rations items, including </p><p>wheat flour, to local shop-based vendors or wholesalers who </p><p>specialize in food items.  The vendors and wholesalers then </p><p>sell the flour in original, unopened bags to mobile traders </p><p>who move the flour (generally using Iraqi registered trucks) </p><p>to towns having a higher market price for flour, such as </p><p>Baghdad where prices hold an approximately 20 percent </p><p>premium to the rest of the country.  In Baghdad, traders </p><p>indicated that most of the WFP-sourced wheat flour in the </p><p>market had been purchased in the northern governorates. </p><p> </p><p>13.  In some instances, beneficiaries do report selling </p><p>their flour entitlements directly to flour agents (FAs), who </p><p>in turn sell it to traders.  According to certain </p><p>interviewees in Baghdad and Arbil, some FAs sell the higher </p><p>quality wheat flour in the market and, in turn, purchase and </p><p>distribute cheaper flour to recipients.  Additionally, it </p><p>was reported that in order to compensate for the higher </p><p>transport and loading/off-loading costs, some food agents </p><p>are charging more than the allowed 250 ID/2.5 DS per person </p><p>and ration. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>PRICE AND QUANTITY OF WHEAT FLOUR IN MARKETS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  As in the northern governorates, prices for wheat flour </p><p>in the southern and central regions are significantly lower </p><p>than they are in Baghdad.  Although vendors in Al Hillah had </p><p>some difficulty giving an exact figure, they estimated a 500- </p><p>1,000 ID difference per 50 kg bag of wheat flour when sold </p><p>in Baghdad.  Traders in Arbil indicated a 2-4 SD (equiv. 460- </p><p>920 ID) difference in the price of a bag of wheat flour if </p><p>sold in Baghdad or Mosul. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Despite this continued price differential, merchants </p><p>report that an apparent glut of wheat flour in the Jameela </p><p>market in Baghdad has caused prices to drop by 50 percent </p><p>since food aid wheat flour became available at the end of </p><p>April.  This reflects a general decreasing price trend for </p><p>wheat flour in the surveyed cities since the PDS restarted. </p><p> </p><p>16.  When asked, traders had strong feelings about the </p><p>variable quality of distributed WFP wheat flour by country </p><p>of origin, and how this corresponds to their customers\' </p><p>baking preferences and product demand.  One of the </p><p>preferences relates to how well a particular wheat flour </p><p>makes the breads suiting local tastes.  Apparently, the USA </p><p>marked wheat flour is of good quality, but not the most </p><p>desirable for making the local flat bread, and it is often </p><p>mixed with courser wheat flour to make it more suitable. </p><p>The more finely milled WFP wheat flour is considered the </p><p>best for commercial baking flour of leavened products.  Most </p><p>non-WFP/USA wheat flour is of Turkish origin, and variable </p><p>in quality and price. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Wheat flour prices by quality: </p><p> </p><p>ARBIL </p><p>WFP wheat flour - high: 40-43 SD/equiv. 9,200 ID </p><p>WFP wheat flour - mid: 19-23 SD </p><p>WFP wheat flour - low: 10-20 SD </p><p>Non-WFP wheat flour - all: 10-50 SD </p><p> </p><p>AS SULAYMANIYAH </p><p>WFP wheat flour - high: 40 SD/equiv. 9,200 ID </p><p>WFP wheat flour - mid: 26-28 SD </p><p>Non-WFP wheat flour - all: 8-45 SD </p><p> </p><p>AL HILLAH </p><p>WFP wheat flour - high: 10,500 ID/equiv. 45 SD </p><p>WFP wheat flour - mid: 7,000 ID </p><p>Non-WFP wheat flour - all: 2,000 ID </p><p> </p><p>BAGHDAD </p><p>WFP wheat flour - high: 12,600 ID/equiv. 55 SD </p><p>WFP wheat flour - mid: 7,000 ID </p><p>Non-WFP wheat flour - all: 14,000-17,500 ID </p><p> </p><p>*Est. exchange rate (July 1, 2003): </p><p>$1: 6.1 SD </p><p>$1: 1,400 ID </p><p>1 SD: 230 ID </p><p> </p><p>18.  Given the rapid survey approach taken by the teams in </p><p>Arbil, As Sulaymaniyah, Al Hillah, and Baghdad, it is </p><p>difficult to estimate overall quantities of wheat being sold </p><p>in these markets and nationwide.  The total PDS distribution </p><p>of wheat flour nationwide to FAs for June is roughly </p><p>estimated to be 237,000 MT (updated daily).  For </p><p>perspective, on the day of the DART survey in Baghdad, </p><p>approximately 300 MT of wheat flour was thought to be on </p><p>sale in the Jameela open market.  As previously noted, about </p><p>75 percent of this flour was marked as WFP/USA. </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  Despite the prevalence of humanitarian food aid </p><p>(particularly wheat flour) observed in the markets of the </p><p>four cities surveyed, there is no indication of an </p><p>organized, large-scale diversion of food aid from the PDS </p><p>for commercialization in urban markets.  Moreover, relative </p><p>to other times of the year, the quantity of wheat flour in </p><p>the markets may be elevated presently due to the recent </p><p>completion of the June PDS ration distribution, residual </p><p>stocks from extra rations being distributed before the </p><p>conflict, the bumper wheat harvest in Iraq this year, and </p><p>the fact that wheat flour sales are more common in the </p><p>summer than winter due to spoilage.  To track trends in the </p><p>sale of humanitarian food aid, continued monitoring of the </p><p>prevalence and pricing of PDS ration items in local markets </p><p>by WFP and USAID/DART is strongly recommended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p></div>
