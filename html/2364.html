<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 000076 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 003/02 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: ANGELO SCOLA: NEW PATRIARCH AND NOW PAPABILE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS APPOINTED A NEW PATRIARCH </p><p>TO LEAD THE CATHOLIC ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION OF VENICE, </p><p>ITALY. 60 YEAR OLD BISHOP ANGELO SCOLA IS ALREADY BEING </p><p>TOUTED AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE NEXT PAPACY. VENICE HAS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00076  071456Z </p><p>PRODUCED THREE RECENT POPES WHO WERE PATRIARCHS PRIOR TO </p><p>ELECTION - PIUS X, JOHN XXIII, AND JOHN PAUL I. SCOLA\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT TO VENICE IS A SIGN OF THE PRESENT PONTIFF\'S </p><p>GREAT ESTEEM FOR THE NEW PATRIARCH. IT REPRESENTS A </p><p>CONSOLIDATION OF THE CONSERVATIVE BLOC WITHIN THE ITALIAN </p><p>BISHOPS CONFERENCE AND ENHANCES THE CHANCE OF AN ITALIAN </p><p>EVENTUALLY REPLACING JOHN PAUL II. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION: ANGELO SCOLA WAS BORN </p><p>NOVEMBER 7, 1941 IN MALGRATE, ITALY. AFTER OBTAINING A </p><p>DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY FROM THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF THE </p><p>SACRED HEART IN MILAN, HE BEGAN HIS THEOLOGICAL STUDIES AT </p><p>SEMINARIES IN SARONNO AND VENEGONO, EVENTUALLY EARNING A </p><p>DOCTORAL DEGREE IN THEOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF FRIBOURG </p><p>IN SWITZERLAND. ACADEMICALLY BRILLIANT, SCOLA WAS ORDAINED A </p><p>PRIEST ON JULY 18, 1970. HIS PRIESTLY CAREER INCLUDED </p><p>UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSHIPS IN SWITZERLAND AND ITALY, </p><p>CULMINATING WITH HIS APPOINTMENT IN 1995 AS RECTOR OF THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL LATERAN UNIVERSITY IN ROME. SCOLA WAS APPOINTED </p><p>BISHOP OF THE ITALIAN DIOCESE OF GROSETTO IN 1991, BUT </p><p>REMAINED THERE A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME BEFORE MOVING ON TO </p><p>THE LATERAN. HE HAS SERVED AS AN ADVISOR TO CARDINAL JOSEPH </p><p>RATZINGER AT THE VATICAN OFFICE FOR DOCTRINAL ORTHODOXY. </p><p>SCOLA IS COSMOPOLITAN, AFFABLE, INTELLIGENT, AND HAS A WARM </p><p>AND FRIENDLY PERSONALITY. HE IS FIERCELY LOYAL TO POPE JOHN </p><p>PAUL II AND THE TENETS OF CATHOLICISM BUT WITHOUT THE </p><p>HANDICAP OF BEING A DEMAGOGUE - PREFERRING TO ENGAGE OTHERS </p><p>BY REASON AND DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) COMMENT: SCOLA\'S APPOINTMENT TO VENICE IS ANOTHER </p><p>STEP ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATED CAREER. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00076  071456Z </p><p>THE FACT THAT HE IS THEOLOGICALLY AND POLITICALLY LINKED TO </p><p>SUCH VATICAN ILLUMINATES AS SECRETARY OF STATE SODANO, </p><p>ORTHODOXY CZAR RATZINGER, AND THE POPE\'S DEPUTY FOR THE </p><p>DIOCESE OF ROME, RUINI AUGURS WELL FOR THE CENTRISTS AT THE </p><p>NEXT PAPAL CONCLAVE. SCOLA\'S ROOTS IN THE COMMUNION AND </p><p>LIBERATION MOVEMENT MAKE HIM A DARLING OF THE CONSERVATIVE </p><p>SECULAR POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. </p><p>IN THIS TWILIGHT ERA OF JOHN PAUL II\'S PONTIFICATE PATRIARCH </p><p>SCOLA, THE POLYGLOT WITH A BRILLIANT THEOLOGICAL REPUTATION, </p><p>WILL BE WORTH KEEPING AN EYE ON. END COMMENT. MERANTE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA00076 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
