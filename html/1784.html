(U) AMBASSADOR HOOKS ATTENDED A DINNER ON JUNE 26 HOSTED BY </p><p>HIS SWEDISH COUNTERPART, LENNARTH HJELMAKER, IN HONOR OF VISITING </p><p>EU GREAT LAKES ENVOY ALDO AJELLO.  ALSO IN ATTENDANCE WERE UNDP </p><p>RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE VICTOR ANGELO AND THE CHIEFS OF MISSION </p><p>FROM AUSTRALIA, DENMARK, NORWAY, AND CANADA, AS WELL AS AJELLO\'S </p><p>TWO ASSISTANTS. </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR HJELMAKER INFORMED THE GROUP THAT AJELLO AND HE </p><p>HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DELIVER TO THE GOZ A LETTER FROM THE EU </p><p>GENERAL AFFAIRS COUNCIL EXPRESSING UNHAPPINESS OVER THE LACK OF </p><p>PROGRESS IN THE ARTICLE 8 DIALOGUE (REFTELS).  THE SWEDISH </p><p>AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED THE FEELING OF DEEP FRUSTRATION FELT BY EU </p><p>MINISTERS GATHERED IN BRUSSELS, AMONG WHOM THERE HAD BEEN COMPLETE </p><p>UNANIMITY ON THE NEED TO SEND THE LETTER AND TO IMPOSE A TWO-MONTH </p><p>DEADLINE FOR ACHIEVEMENT OF SATISFACTORY PROGRESS.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE, HE SAID, MUST MEET THE CONDITIONS IN THE LETTER </p><p>WITHIN TWO MONTHS OR THE EU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY MOVE TO ARTICLE </p><p>96.  HE NOTED THAT EU AMBASSADORS IN HARARE PREFER A MORE MEASURED </p><p>APPROACH, BUT THE MINISTERS ARE DETERMINED TO TAKE A TOUGHER TACK. </p><p>HJELMAKER AND AJELLO PLANNED TO PRESENT THE LETTER TO PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE THE FOLLOWING DAY, ON JUNE 27. </p><p> </p><p>DRC </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AJELLO REPORTED THAT HE HAD MET ON JUNE 25 WITH FM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02012  271453Z </p><p>MUDENGE, WHO FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DRC AND AVOIDED </p><p>DISCUSSION OF ZIMBABWE\'S INTERNAL SITUATION.  MUDENGE CRITICIZED </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR LETTING DOWN THE DRC AND DISMISSED </p><p>EFFORTS TO ARRANGE THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, SAYING THEY WOULD NOT </p><p>SUCCEED.  WHEN AJELLO INQUIRED ABOUT KETUMILE MASIRE\'S RECENT </p><p>VISIT, MUDENGE BURST OUT LAUGHING.  ASKED WHY HE WAS LAUGHING, </p><p>MUDENGE CONTINUED GUFFAWING, BUT FINALLY COMPOSED HIMSELF ENOUGH </p><p>TO COMMENT THAT MASIRE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THE NATIONAL </p><p>DIALOGUE, AND IT WOULD FAIL.  MUDENGE INSISTED THAT ZIMBABWE IS </p><p>NOT REQUIRED TO WITHDRAW ITS TROOPS BECAUSE THEY WERE INVITED INTO </p><p>THE DRC.  AJELLO HAD BEEN TOLD HE COULD MEET ON JUNE 26 WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE BUT WAS KEPT WAITING ALL DAY.  THE MUGABE MEETING </p><p>WAS RESCHEDULED FOR THE MORNING OF JUNE 27. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SHARING HIS OWN VIEWS ON THE DRC, AJELLO SAID KABILA AND </p><p>HIS ALLIES ARE DELIBERATELY PUSHING NEGATIVE FORCES (RWANDAN EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERAHAMWE) TO THE EAST.  HE REJECTED MUDENGE\'S CONTENTION </p><p>REGARDING THE WITHDRAWAL OF ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS, SAYING THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER SEEMED TO HAVE OVERLOOKED THE FACT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>SIGNED THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  REGARDING THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, THE EU </p><p>ENVOY DECLARED THAT MASIRE IS GOING ABOUT IT THE WRONG WAY AND </p><p>REFUSES TO ACCEPT ANY ADVICE.  HE LAMENTED THAT THE PROCESS COULD </p><p>DRAG ON FOR YEARS.  TWO FUNDAMENTAL OBSTACLES TO THE NATIONAL </p><p>DIALOGUE, ACCORDING TO AJELLO, ARE THAT THE REBELS WILL NOT ACCEPT </p><p>KABILA AS PRESIDENT, AND KABILA WILL NOT COMMIT POLITICAL SUICIDE </p><p>BY ENGAGING TOO SERIOUSLY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUDENGE\'S REPORTED CLAIM THAT ZIMBABWE IS NOT REQUIRED TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02012  271453Z </p><p>WITHDRAW ITS TROOPS IS TROUBLING AND REFLECTS A DELIBERATE </p><p>MISINTERPRETATION OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  HIS REMARK, HOWEVER, IS </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH RECENT COMMENTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS, INCLUDING SENIOR DEFENSE FORCE LEADERS.  THEIR REMARKS </p><p>SUGGEST A DETERMINATION TO LEAVE BEHIND AT LEAST A SMALL MILITARY </p><p>CONTINGENT TO PROTECT ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMIC INTERESTS, IRRESPECTIVE </p><p>OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE OTHER ALLIED FORCES OR THE LANGUAGE </p><p>CONTAINED IN THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  ZIMBABWE IS ALSO RELUCTANT TO </p><p>GIVE UP ITS INFLUENCE OVER THE NEW KABILA REGIME, SOMETHING ITS </p><p>TROOP PRESENCE ENSURES.  THAT SAID, WE REMAIN CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>GOZ HOPES TO BRING HOME MOST OF ITS TROOPS PRIOR TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION EXPECTED IN EARLY 2002.  AJELLO WAS </p><p>CONTEMPTUOUS OF MASIRE\'S APPROACH TO THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE AND HAD </p><p>NO EXPECTATION THAT HIS EFFORTS WOULD BEAR FRUIT. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
