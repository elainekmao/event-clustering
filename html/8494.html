<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002474 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/BRUMFIELD </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL/IL AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ECON, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT:  PENSION REFORM:  NERO\'S ORCHESTRA PRACTICING FOR </p><p>UPCOMING PERFORMANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 1899 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  Like many of its European partners, the Berlusconi </p><p>government is struggling to reform Italy\'s generous pension </p><p>system and control anticipated runaway growth in pension </p><p>expenditures in the coming years.  At this stage, it\'s not </p><p>at all clear the government will succeed.  There\'s </p><p>widespread agreement that the current system, if not yet </p><p>broken, will break down shortly.  But every self-styled </p><p>mechanic has a different solution, one that reflects, </p><p>naturally, its own priorities.  The competing interests, </p><p>both across society and within the Berlusconi government\'s </p><p>coalition, have marched steadily toward confrontation.  The </p><p>unknown variable, at this point, is Berlusconi, who has </p><p>espoused a variety of views on both the content and timing </p><p>of concluding a reform package wending its way through </p><p>parliament.  His real position on the issue, one that </p><p>truncated his first stint as prime minister, will determine </p><p>whether the current reform package comes to fruition or goes </p><p>up in smoke.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FROM ECONOMIC MILLSTONE... </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Italy\'s pension system suffers from the same structural </p><p>problems plaguing those in many other advanced industrial </p><p>European economies: an overly generous defined-benefit </p><p>scheme that is not sustainable with the country\'s aging </p><p>population.  Too few workers are paying for too many </p><p>retirees; those pensioners are living longer than ever and, </p><p>consequently, taking far more out of the pension system than </p><p>they ever put into it.  The current system, which allows </p><p>many Italians to retire as early as age 57 on as much as 75 </p><p>percent of their high salary range, sucks up 13.9 percent of </p><p>GDP (second only to Austria).  Absent substantial reforms </p><p>that delay eligibility, reduce benefits or both, the pension </p><p>millstone will grow to 16 percent of GDP in 2033.  It\'s no </p><p>wonder the subject is enough to send most politicos and </p><p>government budget officials running for the hills. </p><p> </p><p>3. In 1995, then-Prime Minister Dini completed the first </p><p>substantial reforms to the system, launching a gradual shift </p><p>from a defined-benefit to defined-contribution scheme, </p><p>raising the retirement age for many to 65 and creating a </p><p>"second pillar" in the pension system, private pension </p><p>funds.  These important structural changes yielded over 28 </p><p>billion euros in savings from 1996-2000, saving the public </p><p>system from insolvency.  But the real pain necessary for </p><p>long-term sustainability -- reduced pensions (and the </p><p>attendant popular outcry) -- was deferred until 2005, when </p><p>the formulae/coefficients used to calculate annuities may </p><p>first be "reevaluated" (i.e., lowered).  Moreover, Italy\'s </p><p>undercapitalized securities markets, dominated by a small </p><p>coterie of companies, have generated neither the returns nor </p><p>the stability and confidence required to attract workers\' </p><p>retirement savings.  Less than ten percent of eligible </p><p>workers have money invested in the 44 collective private </p><p>pension funds established through labor-management </p><p>negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>...TO ELECTORAL CORNERSTONE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. Prime Minister Berlusconi made pension reform a </p><p>cornerstone of his 2001 electoral "contract with Italy" to </p><p>revitalize the economy, improve government services and, in </p><p>general, make Italy more competitive.  Two years later, the </p><p>government has shown little progress on this piece of the </p><p>economic reform puzzle.  Despite a substantial parliamentary </p><p>majority, reform legislation languished in committee until </p><p>late February, when a modest package cleared the lower </p><p>Chamber of Deputies.  That slow pace reflected both the </p><p>explosive nature of the issue and the lack of consensus, </p><p>either within the government or between the government, </p><p>employers and unions -- over the best package of reform </p><p>measures.  Italy\'s three major union confederations agree on </p><p>little else these days, but they have forged a common </p><p>position on pension reform.  Labor ministry officials have </p><p>told us that it also reflected a tactical decision to await </p><p>help from Brussels, in the form of EU recommendations on </p><p>further reducing Italy\'s public debt and revamping the </p><p>pension system, that it could use in developing a consensus. </p><p> </p><p>INTERIM SOLUTION DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. In the meantime, the government is pursuing a two-pronged </p><p>interim solution: energizing private pension funds by </p><p>injecting additional capital, and improving incentives for </p><p>employees to defer retirement and reducing their pension </p><p>contributions.  Though many judged the reform proposal that </p><p>passed the Chamber in late February surprisingly modest, its </p><p>provisions bundled measures to accomplish these objectives </p><p>with sweeteners to secure the acceptance of employers, who </p><p>are most concerned with excessively high overall labor </p><p>costs.  The legislation: </p><p> </p><p>-- abolishes mandatory retirement at 65; </p><p> </p><p>-- creates additional incentives for employees to continue </p><p>working past 65, primarily by reducing their payroll tax </p><p>rate for social security (and thereby raising their take- </p><p>home wages) and maintaining provisions of the standard labor </p><p>contract as well; </p><p> </p><p>-- provides employers additional incentives to hire new </p><p>workers, lowering employers\' contribution to public pension </p><p>funds for new young workers by up to 5 percent; </p><p> </p><p>-- requires employers to transfer severance pay (which they </p><p>currently hold in escrow pending employee\'s departure) to </p><p>private pension funds. </p><p> </p><p>Implied but unspoken in the legislation is the government\'s </p><p>intended second step: an actual reduction of public </p><p>pensions, perhaps either via adjustment of the annuity </p><p>coefficients during the 2005 review required under the Dini </p><p>reform package or pro-rata extension of the defined- </p><p>contribution scheme to all workers.  Some analysts believe </p><p>the Berlusconi government thinks it will be able to weather </p><p>public opposition to reduced benefits under the new defined- </p><p>benefit scheme if it has succeeded in creating an </p><p>alternative private system to provide additional retirement </p><p>income to offset the loss of public pension money. </p><p> </p><p>6. Not surprisingly, both employers and unions found plenty </p><p>objectionable in the draft legislation.  Employers are </p><p>unenthused by the prospect of relinquishing management of </p><p>the severance pay, which has provided a handy working </p><p>capital fund for many companies (since they must set aside </p><p>severance for all employees but only pay out a small portion </p><p>to those employees who depart in a given year). </p><p>Confindustria, the largest employers\' association, was </p><p>unhappy with the proposal but ultimately accepted it because </p><p>it was accompanied by reductions in employers\' overall labor </p><p>costs.  But the organization continues to call for more </p><p>radical reform, including use of disincentives (reduced </p><p>annuities) to discourage workers from retiring early. </p><p> </p><p>LABOR\'S SUPPORT FOR DIFFERENT PLAN </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. Labor, meanwhile, has a radically different set of </p><p>priorities and proposed solutions.  The unions agree that </p><p>excessively high labor costs are stifling business growth </p><p>and, to varying degrees, support long-term structural </p><p>changes to the public pension system.  But with roughly half </p><p>their collective membership drawn from the ranks of retired </p><p>workers, the unions strongly oppose any short-term </p><p>reductions in pensions -- or any structural changes that </p><p>might make future reductions (say, when the annuity </p><p>coefficients are reevaluated in 2005) easier.  After months </p><p>of independent action, the three confederations hammered out </p><p>a joint position in March that: </p><p> </p><p>--  opposes a mandatory shift of severance pay; instead, </p><p>workers would retain the choice but be encouraged to shift </p><p>their severance to the private funds through tax breaks; </p><p> </p><p>-- proposes additional incentives to funnel severance pay </p><p>into "closed" pension funds, established on a sectoral or </p><p>company basis and managed jointly by employers and unions; </p><p> </p><p>-- opposes reductions in employer contributions to public </p><p>pensions; </p><p> </p><p>-- suggests reducing employers\' labor costs by reducing </p><p>contributions to other social programs, such as maternity </p><p>leave, instead of to the pension system. </p><p> </p><p>POSSIBLE JUNE CONFRONTATION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. For all of the maneuvering, there is still no clear </p><p>impetus, or reason, for early resolution.  Berlusconi has </p><p>blown hot and cold, spending much of the spring underscoring </p><p>the imperative of rapid agreement of the package, then </p><p>announcing May 22 that pension reform was a "European </p><p>problem" whose repair should await Italy\'s EU presidency </p><p>tenure.  The main force for early agreement appears to be </p><p>Labor Minister Maroni (one of three ministers from the </p><p>idiosyncratic, regionally-focused Northern League), who </p><p>spent much of the last month in serial sessions with both </p><p>employers and unions.  Maroni had sought to reassure labor </p><p>and coax some flexibility from it by suggesting that one </p><p>possible fix -- disincentives for early retirement, in the </p><p>form of reduced annuities -- was off the table.  In early </p><p>May, though, PM Berlusconi showed one of his cards in </p><p>declaring his support for disincentives, comments that were </p><p>echoed by Deputy Prime Minister Fini (head of the second </p><p>largest coalition partner, National Alliance) and </p><p>Confindustria head D\'Amato.  D\'Amato is the other force </p><p>driving for early resolution, urging the government to </p><p>conclude the reform package before parliament is embroiled </p><p>in its annual budget battles. </p><p> </p><p>9. In response, Maroni sought, and secured, Berlusconi\'s </p><p>agreement to a cabinet meeting to reaffirm a unified </p><p>government position on the draft legislation -- and </p><p>reiterated his position that the final package would not </p><p>include disincentives.  In the run-up to the cabinet </p><p>meeting, the unions are holding firm to their position, </p><p>promising coordinated general strikes in late June if the </p><p>legislation is not modified to reflect their position. </p><p> </p><p>WHICH LEAVES US...HANGING </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. Whichever metaphor one prefers, it\'s not at all clear </p><p>how this will play out.  Despite near-universal agreement </p><p>that the pension system needs fixing, the substantial </p><p>differences among the various self-styled mechanics makes a </p><p>compromise difficult.  Maroni continues to insist that a </p><p>workable compromise is achievable, but one wonders if he\'s </p><p>trying to convince himself as much as the wider audience. </p><p>How the battle over the reform legislation plays out will go </p><p>a long way to determining how much stomach the government </p><p>has to tackle the heart of meaningful pension reform  -- </p><p>reduced public annuities-- that looms toward the end of its </p><p>expected term in office. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02474 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
