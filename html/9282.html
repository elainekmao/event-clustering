<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004157 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, July 9, are </p><p>reports about the Palestinian Prime Minister\'s threat </p><p>to resign as the head of the Palestinian government </p><p>amidst tension within the Palestinian leadership over </p><p>negotiations with Israel.  Front pages also report on </p><p>the situation in Iraq highlighting Iraqi "guerilla" </p><p>attacks against Coalition forces and the latest audio </p><p>tape, claimed to have been made by Saddam Hussein, </p><p>urging Iraqis to launch "covert" attacks as "the best </p><p>way to end the occupation". </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The stage of difficult tests" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(07/09) editorializes:  "Facts on the ground in the </p><p>Palestinian territory seems to be very complicated and </p><p>difficult..  The suffering of Palestinian Prime </p><p>Minister Mahmoud Abbas seems quite evident as he tries </p><p>to reconcile between the various contradictions on the </p><p>Palestinian front and manage negotiations with the </p><p>Israeli side that continues to carry out maneuvers in </p><p>an attempt to jeopardize everything that Mr. Abbas is </p><p>trying to achieve..  The Islamic Jihad Movement did </p><p>well to declare that the latest operation, which was </p><p>done by one of its members, had not been part of its </p><p>program and that it is committed to the truce.  Yet, </p><p>as important as this clarification is, there has to be </p><p>total control over such action, in order not to give </p><p>the Israelis the pretext or the justification for </p><p>refusing the release of prisoners who belong to those </p><p>Palestinian factions..  We continue to urge the </p><p>Palestinian factions to block Israel\'s way and call </p><p>for further American follow-up and direct mediation in </p><p>order to remove the obstacles that Israel is placing </p><p>in the path to peace and help everyone overcome this </p><p>stage of difficult tests". </p><p> </p><p>-- "When Mahmoud Abbas resigns" </p><p> </p><p>Semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai (07/09) </p><p>editorializes:  "The resignation of the Palestinian </p><p>Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas from Fateh takes the </p><p>Palestinian domestic front back to square one, just </p><p>when things have started to look like they were </p><p>heading towards calm and quiet..  Pushing Abbas </p><p>against the wall and tying his hands behind his back </p><p>achieves nothing but what we think would be a not so </p><p>noble objective, simply because it means suicide. </p><p>This is because the hole that would be left by Abbas\' </p><p>resignation from government will prove to be a success </p><p>and an opportunity for the Sharon government to </p><p>portray itself as the one that wants peace and the </p><p>Palestinians as wanting nothing but extremism and </p><p>terrorism; Israeli charges by all means".
