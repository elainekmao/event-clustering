<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, DRL, DRL/CRA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  07-28-13 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PINS, CE, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  Human rights update:  Court convicts five for </p><p>role in massacre; Security crackdown nets Tamils </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1290, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F. Entwistle, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of the human rights situation in </p><p>Sri Lanka reviews the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Police officers and Sinhalese civilians sentenced in </p><p>connection with killings of Tamils in 2000 </p><p> </p><p>-- Alleged ringleader of killings of Muslims on election </p><p>day 2001 gets bail </p><p> </p><p>-- Tamils detained in Colombo during security crackdown </p><p> </p><p>-- Commission\'s findings re bloody `83 riots begin to </p><p>leak out </p><p> </p><p>CONVICTIONS IN MASSACRE OF TAMILS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (U) Two Sri Lankan police officers and three </p><p>Sinhalese civilians were sentenced to death on July 1 </p><p>for their involvement in the October 2000 slayings of 27 </p><p>Tamils.  (Note:  The death sentences were later </p><p>ratcheted down to 23 years imprisonment.  While the </p><p>death penalty remains on the books in Sri Lanka, it has </p><p>not been imposed in years -- see Reftels.)  The case </p><p>involves a large-scale attack by local villagers on a </p><p>rehabilitation camp for former child soldiers of the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) located in Uva </p><p>Province in the southeast.  (Note:  The villagers were </p><p>infuriated that a camp for former Tamil Tiger militants </p><p>was located in their home area.)  The police in charge </p><p>of guarding the camp allowed the villagers to enter and </p><p>massacre the detainees.  All those convicted were </p><p>Sinhalese. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  The convictions of the five men is an </p><p>important event, representing as it does one of the few </p><p>times that Sinhalese have been held accountable for the </p><p>deaths of Tamils during the course of the 1983-2001 </p><p>ethnic conflict.  In particular, the convictions of the </p><p>two police officers underscores the widening cracks in </p><p>the climate of impunity which for so long protected </p><p>government officials from prosecution.  The sad fact, </p><p>however, is that only three villagers were convicted in </p><p>the attacks, which involved dozens, if not hundreds, of </p><p>locals.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION DAY KILLING OF MUSLIM CAMPAIGN WORKERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>4.  (SBU) Anuruddha Ratwatte, a well-connected former </p><p>deputy defense minister, was released on bail July 11 </p><p>for his alleged role in the killings of ten Muslims in </p><p>December 2001.  Ratwatte\'s two sons and 12 other </p><p>defendants were also released on bail.  Ratwatte was </p><p>released on cash bail of Rs. 25,000 (approx. 250 USD) </p><p>and Rs. 100,000 personal bail (approx. 1000 USD).  The </p><p>case stems from the massacre of ten campaign workers for </p><p>the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) on election day, </p><p>December 5, 2001.  The incident took place near Kandy </p><p>city in central Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  The killings of the Muslims sparked </p><p>large protests in that community, with the government </p><p>forced to impose a curfew in much of the country to curb </p><p>disturbances.  Muslim anger over what transpired still </p><p>simmers -- and Ratwatte\'s release is controversial.  His </p><p>trial court judge had repeatedly turned down his request </p><p>for bail, citing the severity of the crimes.  The </p><p>Supreme Court intervened, however, and granted bail. </p><p>Several observers have questioned the impartiality of </p><p>the Supreme Court\'s decision, noting that the court is </p><p>generally considered pro-President Kumaratunga and that </p><p>Ratwatte is a close relative of the president\'s.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>TAMIL YOUTHS DETAINED IN COLOMBO </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (U) A recent security crackdown in Colombo has </p><p>resulted in a sharp jump in the number of Tamils </p><p>detained for questioning by police.  Police contacts </p><p>report that from early June through July over five </p><p>hundred people were arrested for failure to produce </p><p>national identity cards or "on suspicion."  The vast </p><p>majority of those detained were quickly released, though </p><p>a handful were kept incarcerated for further </p><p>questioning.  Interior Minister John Amaratunga, seeking </p><p>to defuse tensions in the Tamil community (which </p><p>represents over 20 percent of Colombo\'s population), </p><p>told the press June 28 that the recent crackdown was not </p><p>meant to target Tamils, but to increase security and </p><p>curb crime in the capital.  The intensity of the </p><p>security crackdown has largely leveled off since mid- </p><p>July. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  In mandating the security crackdown, </p><p>the GSL was reacting to a spate of recent assassinations </p><p>of opponents of the LTTE which have taken place in </p><p>Colombo and elsewhere (see Reftels).  It is not clear </p><p>whether the government\'s effort led to the arrest of any </p><p>armed LTTE cadre, though it may have scared some off. </p><p>While aware of the danger that LTTE elements pose, human </p><p>rights activists expressed concern that the GSL\'s </p><p>actions were a return to the widespread "cordon and </p><p>search" operations of the past in which thousands of </p><p>Tamils were detained for long stretches, especially </p><p>after LTTE terrorist attacks.  These operations </p><p>alienated many in the Tamil community.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS OF REPORT ON `83 RIOTS LEAK OUT </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>8.  (U) Although it has not been officially released, </p><p>the contents of the final report of the Presidential </p><p>Truth Commission on Ethnic Violence in Sri Lanka have </p><p>been leaking out in recent days.  (Note:  The </p><p>commission, which consists of former jurists and </p><p>lawyers, was appointed by President Kumaratunga in 2001 </p><p>to delve into the causes of the communal riots that </p><p>shook Sri Lanka in the early 1980s.  The most serious of </p><p>these took place in Colombo in July 1983 -- see </p><p>Reftels.)  English-language newspapers, for example, </p><p>have been regularly serializing the report, which is </p><p>largely a factual rundown of what the commission </p><p>believed occurred at that time. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Human rights activists have been </p><p>impressed by the sections of the report that have been </p><p>published thus far.  The commission seems to have done a </p><p>careful job in turning up the facts in what were often </p><p>murky incidents.  Moreover, the commission appears to </p><p>have steered away from trying to place "blame" per se. </p><p>This non-accusatory approach has been welcomed in light </p><p>of fears that the commission, which had been appointed </p><p>by the president, might simply bash her political </p><p>opponents and not much else.  It is not clear when the </p><p>commission\'s report will be officially released or if </p><p>its final recommendations will be implemented by the </p><p>government.  (Note:  One newspaper on July 27 published </p><p>the report\'s 12 recommendations, which focus on </p><p>everything from the need for ethnic reconciliation to </p><p>possible reparations for victims.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
