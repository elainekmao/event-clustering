<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001232 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR E, EB/OMA, EUR/ERA; TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/08/2011 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, IT, IDA, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI ON EU/USG IMPASSE ON IDA GRANTS NEAR </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERCOME </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER COUNSELOR MARGARET DEAN FOR REASONS 1. </p><p>5 (B). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01232  081641Z </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. THE EU\'S POSITION ON AN ENHANCED IDA GRANT </p><p>PROGRAM IS CLEAR: SUCH A PROGRAM MUST BE VERY LIMITED IN </p><p>SCOPE, TARGETED FOR BASIC NEEDS (E.G. HEALTH AND EDUCATION), </p><p>AND TESTED OVER SEVERAL YEARS. LORENZO BINI SMAGHI, DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL FOR INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS AT ITALY\'S </p><p>FINANCE MINISTRY, TOLD ECMIN THAT THE DIVERGENT VIEWS BETWEEN </p><p>THE U.S. AND EUROPE MAY NOT BE RECONCILABLE.  FURTHER U.S. </p><p>INSISTENCE MAY PROMPT SOME MEMBER STATES TO RETRACT THEIR </p><p>SUPPORT FOR A BEEFED UP GRANT PROGRAM, AT ANY LEVEL, HE </p><p>WARNED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POST MET WITH BINI SMAGHI, ITALY\'S FINANCIAL SHERPA, </p><p>WHO OVERSEES ALL INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL POLICY, TO DISCUSS </p><p>IDA AND OTHER FINANCIAL ISSUES. TREASURY U/S TAYLOR AND HE </p><p>HAVE BEEN IN FREQUENT CONTACT ON IDA GRANTS AND OTHER ISSUES. </p><p> BINI SMAGHI SAID THE EU, WHICH CONTRIBUTES NEARLY 50 PERCENT </p><p>TO IDA, HAS MET THE UNITED STATES PART WAY ON THE ISSUE OF </p><p>IDA GRANTS.  THERE IS NO WAY THE U.S.- DESIRED TARGET LEVELS </p><p>FOR IDA GRANTS CAN BE REACHED IN SUCH A SHORT TIME, BINI </p><p>SMAGHI ARGUED.  NO CERTAINTY EXISTS THAT AN ENHANCED PROGRAM, </p><p>AT THE LEVELS IDENTIFIED BY THE USG, WOULD BE EFFECTIVE, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STRONG, WELL-DEFINED AND </p><p>ENFORCED CONDITIONALITY.  PREVIOUS LENDING POLICIES SHOULD </p><p>NOT BE ABANDONED OVERNIGHT, HE CONTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE EU\'S POSITION HAS NOT BEEN STATIC. "WE ARE NOW </p><p>WILLING TO CONSIDER FOR CERTAIN GROUPS OF COUNTRIES -- </p><p>PERHAPS FOR THOSE WITH A PER CAPITA OF US ONE DOLLAR A DAY OR </p><p>LESS -- A GRANT PROGRAM OF 50 PERCENT, TARGETED FOR HEALTH </p><p>AND EDUCATION. IN POST-CONFLICT AND NATURAL DISASTER CASES, A </p><p>GRANT PROGRAM OF 100 PERCENT COULD EVEN BE CONSIDERED," </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01232  081641Z </p><p>STATED BINI SMAGHI.  THIS SHOULD BE THE FRAMEWORK FOR AN </p><p>ENHANCED IDA GRANT PROGRAM.  IF THE PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL, BY </p><p>MEASURES STILL TO BE DEFINED, THE LEVEL OF GRANTS COULD BE </p><p>INCREASED AT A FUTURE DATE, TO MIRROR THE LEVELS THE USG NOW </p><p>PROPOSES.  BINI SMAGHI BELIEVES A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS IS </p><p>REQUIRED TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A RECONSTITUTED GRANT </p><p>PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) RATHER THAN INSISTING ON GREATER MOVEMENT BY EUROPEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, THE USG SHOULD RECOGNIZE AND ACCEPT THE PROGRESS </p><p>MADE WITH EU MEMBER STATES.  THE USG SHOULD NOT IGNORE THE </p><p>CONTENTIOUSNESS OF THIS ISSUE, AND THE SERIOUS OPPOSITION </p><p>FROM SEVERAL COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN SCANDINAVIA, TO ANY </p><p>INCREASE IN GRANTS, BINI SMAGHI COMMENTED.  THE USG\'S </p><p>RELENTLESS PRESSURE ALMOST CAUSED NORWAY, SWEDEN AND A FEW </p><p>OTHERS TO RETRACT THEIR SUPPORT FOR EVEN A LIMITED, TARGETED </p><p>50 PERCENT GRANT PROGRAM. BINI SMAGHI ASSERTED THAT IT WAS </p><p>ONLY BECAUSE ITALY, AS A G7 MEMBER, EXERTED PRESSURE ON </p><p>SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS THAT EU CONSENSUS KEPT FROM BREAKING </p><p>DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THERE\'S A PERCEPTION AMONG EU MEMBERS THAT THE USG </p><p>DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, BINI SMAGHI </p><p>REMARKED.  GRANTS ARE THE PREFERRED MECHANISM FOR BILATERAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, AND EU GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE </p><p>UNDP.  "SO, CLEARLY, WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO GRANTS IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE," HE ARGUED.  FOR EU GOVERNMENTS, HOWEVER, IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE DIVISION OF LABOR </p><p>BETWEEN THE WORLD BANK AND THE UNITED NATIONS, BETWEEN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND BILATERAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>PROGRAMS. MOREOVER, THE WORLD BANK DOES NOT HAVE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01232  081641Z </p><p>NECESSARY EXPERTISE TO ESTABLISH AND MONITOR THE IMPOSITION </p><p>OF EFFECTIVE CONDITIONALITY. (NOTE: MOST OF ITALY\'S BILATERAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE ALSO IS IN GRANT FORM.  ITALY HAS, HOWEVER, A LOW </p><p>LEVEL OF OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, JUST .14 PERCENT OF </p><p>GDP IN 2001.  THE GOI HAS MADE SOME NOISE ABOUT UPPING THIS </p><p>TO .7 PERCENT OF GDP BY 2006, BUT NO ROAD MAP TO THAT TARGET </p><p>YET EXISTS.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: BINI SMAGHI IS CLEARLY PESSIMISTIC THAT THE </p><p>IMPASSE BETWEEN THE USG AND THE EU WILL BE BROKEN IF WE </p><p>CONTINUE HARD OVER ON OUR WAY. HE WAS WILLING TO HEAR OUR </p><p>ARGUMENTS, BUT DID NOT DEVIATE FROM THE EU COMMON POSITION. </p><p>ITALY WHOLEHEARTEDLY SHARES THE EU CONSENSUS AND A PHASED </p><p>APPROACH TO INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF GRANTS.  THEY WILL </p><p>USE THEIR INFLUENCE, AS THEY HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED, TO </p><p>KEEP THE EU CONSENSUS AT 50 PERCENT, WITH CONDITIONS FOR </p><p>CERTAIN COUNTRIES.  THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN BROKERING </p><p>ANYTHING BEYOND THIS. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>POPE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01232 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
