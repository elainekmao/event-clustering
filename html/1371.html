(C) SUMMARY: THE RULING PARTY ZANU-PF CANDIDATE WON </p><p>THE BY-ELECTION FOR THE MARONDERA WEST PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>SEAT HELD NOVEMBER 25 AND 26.  VOTING WAS PEACEFUL, BUT </p><p>THE TURNOUT WAS LOW - JUST UNDER A THIRD OF THE </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS.  DISTRICT RESIDENTS TOLD EMBASSY AND </p><p>NGO PERSONNEL ON NOVEMBER 25 THAT THERE HAD BEEN A HIGH </p><p>DEGREE OF INTIMIDATION OF VOTERS IN THE RUN-UP TO THE </p><p>BY-ELECTION BY ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS, WAR VETERANS, AND THE </p><p>POLICE AND MILITARY THAT RESULTED IN ONE DEATH. </p><p>INTIMIDATION OF VOTERS WAS NOT EVIDENT TO US ON THE </p><p>VOTING DAYS OF NOVEMBER 25 AND 26.  POLL WATCHERS FOR </p><p>BOTH ZANU-PF AND MDC WERE ALLOWED TO MONITOR THE VOTING </p><p>AND SAFEGUARD THE BALLOT BOXES, BUT DUE TO THE PRE- </p><p>ELECTION INTIMIDATION, THE ELECTION CANNOT BE CONSIDERED </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN FREE AND FAIR IN OUR JUDGEMENT.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE WINS, BUT WITH A SMALLER MAJORITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE IN THE MARONDERA WEST BY- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06658  01 OF 02  282215Z </p><p>ELECTION, AMBROSE MUTINHIRI, A RETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL </p><p>AND FORMER AMBASSADOR TO YUGOSLAVIA, WON THE ELECTION, </p><p>BUT GARNERED FAR FEWER VOTES THAN HIS PREDECESSOR, WHOSE </p><p>DEATH IN A CAR ACCIDENT IN JULY BROUGHT ABOUT THE BY- </p><p>ELECTION.  THE NOVEMBER 28 ISSUE OF THE GOZ-CONTROLLED </p><p>"THE HERALD" NEWSPAPER REPORTED MUTINHIRI RECEIVED 7,376 </p><p>VOTES VERSUS 4,366 VOTES FOR THE MDC CANDIDATE SHADRECK </p><p>CHIPANGURA.  MUTINHIRI RECEIVED ALMOST 4,000 FEWER VOTES </p><p>THAN THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE IN LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION, WHILE THE MDC CANDIDATE ONLY RECEIVED 200 </p><p>FEWER VOTES.  THIS LOWERED VOTE TALLY OCCURRED EVEN </p><p>THOUGH ZANU-PF PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS IN THE CAMPAIGN, </p><p>WITH BIASED MEDIA COVERAGE, THE USE OF WAR VETERANS TO </p><p>PROMOTE THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE AND INTIMIDATE MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS, AND PERSONAL CAMPAIGNING BY CHENJERAI </p><p>"HITLER" HUNZVI, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ZIMBABWE NATIONAL </p><p>LIBERATION WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION, AND RETIRED ZDF </p><p>GENERAL AND ZANU-PF HEAVYWEIGHT SOLOMON MUJURU. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>MARONDERA WEST BY-ELECTION HELD ON UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ECONOFF, THE USAID DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE </p><p>OFFICER, A USAID FOREIGN SERVICE NATIONAL AND A SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA-BASED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE OBSERVED THE BY-ELECTION ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 25 AND 26.  CANDIDATES FROM THREE PARTIES RAN </p><p>FOR THE VACANT SEAT, BUT THE RACE REALLY BOILED DOWN TO </p><p>A CONTEST BETWEEN THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE AND THE MDC </p><p>CANDIDATE.  THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE ZDF HAD SENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06658  01 OF 02  282215Z </p><p>SOLDIERS TO CAMPAIGN FOR MUTINHIRI, AND THAT THE RULING </p><p>PARTY BROUGHT IN SUPPORTERS FROM NEIGHBORING AREAS TO </p><p>CAMPAIGN AND POSSIBLY EVEN VOTE ILLEGALLY FOR HIM. </p><p>THERE WERE ALSO ALLEGATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S (GOZ) MINISTRY OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, GENDER </p><p>AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION HAD BOUGHT THE VOTES OF YOUTH </p><p>AND OTHER VOTERS IN THE DISTRICT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE MDC HAS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A CONCERTED </p><p>CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION IN THE WEEKS PRECEDING THE BY- </p><p>ELECTION.  THIS ALLEGEDLY INCLUDED MILITARY AND POLICE </p><p>PERSONNEL GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE AT NIGHT </p><p>INTIMIDATING THE OCCUPANTS.  WAR VETERANS WERE ALSO OUT </p><p>IN FORCE, AND WERE STILL SEEN BY US CAMPED OUT IN THE </p><p>DISTRICT ON NOVEMBER 25 AND 26.  WAR VETS ALLEGEDLY </p><p>ATTACKED AND BROKE THE LEGS OF TWO MDC SUPPORTERS THE </p><p>DAY BEFORE THE ELECTIONS.  ON NOVEMBER 25, CHENJERAI </p><p>"HITLER" HUNZVI ALLEGEDLY HELD A PISTOL TO THE HEAD OF </p><p>AN MDC POLL WATCHER, AND THEN CHASED THE POLL WATCHER </p><p>AND ANOTHER MDC SUPPORTER AWAY FROM THE POLLING STATION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO A EUROPEAN UNION ELECTION OBSERVER.  OUR </p><p>SOURCE TOLD US THAT A ZIMBABWEAN WHO OBSERVED THIS </p><p>INCIDENT SAID TO HUNZVI "ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS IN A </p><p>CIVILIZED MANNER?", TO WHICH HUNZVI ANGRILY REPLIED "I </p><p>AM NOT A CIVILIZED PERSON."  BOTH HUNZVI AND RETIRED </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES GENERAL SOLOMON MUJURU WERE SEEN </p><p>BY THE MISSION OBSERVERS IN THE DISTRICT ON NOVEMBER 25. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9047 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06658  02 OF 02  282215Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------A4EBE6  282340Z /38 </p><p>R 281458Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7725 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006658 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AND AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p> </p><p>NNEWMAN </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06658  02 OF 02  282215Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/28/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF WINS MARONDERA WEST BY-ELECTION; LOW </p><p>TURNOUT LIKELY THE RESULT OF PRE-ELECTION INTIMIDATION </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>VOTING IN BY-ELECTION IS PEACEFUL </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE VOTING TOOK PLACE IN A PEACEFUL MANNER ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 25 AND 26.  OUR OBSERVERS DID NOT WITNESS ANY </p><p>CLEAR INTIMIDATION OF VOTERS ON THESE TWO DAYS.  THEY </p><p>WERE NOT ACCREDITED BY THE GOZ, AND THEREFORE OBSERVED </p><p>VOTING ON AN UNOFFICIAL BASIS.  ON NOVEMBER 25, THEY </p><p>ENTERED A NUMBER OF POLLING STATIONS AND WERE ABLE TO </p><p>VERIFY THAT POLL WATCHERS FOR BOTH ZANU-PF AND THE MDC </p><p>WERE PRESENT AT ALL STATIONS VISITED.  POLICE AND </p><p>ELECTION OFFICIALS WERE GENERALLY FRIENDLY WHEN </p><p>APPROACHED.  THE OBSERVERS ALSO VISITED THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMAND STATION FOR THE ELECTION, AND WERE INTRODUCED TO </p><p>THE HEAD ELECTION OFFICIAL, WHO STATED THAT HE WAS FROM </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION.  (NOTE: THE GOZ MINISTRY OF </p><p>INFORMATION NO LONGER EXISTS, AS IT WAS RECENTLY FOLDED </p><p>INTO THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE.  END NOTE.)  MISSION </p><p>OBSERVERS HAD TO SIGN THEIR NAMES ON VISITORS\' ROLLS AT </p><p>TWO OF THE POLLING STATIONS VISITED, AND POLL OFFICIALS </p><p>NOTED THAT THE PERSONNEL WERE FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY.  ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 26, THE ATTITUDE AND RECEPTION AT THE POLLING </p><p>STATIONS TOWARD THE AMERICAN OBSERVERS WAS NOTABLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06658  02 OF 02  282215Z </p><p>FROSTIER.  IT APPEARED THAT POLLING OFFICIALS AND </p><p>POLICEMEN HAD RECEIVED WORD NOT TO INTERACT OR TALK WITH </p><p>THE OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>LOW TURNOUT FOR THE BY-ELECTION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE BY-ELECTION HAD BEEN TOUTED AS A TEST OF </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S, AND INDIRECTLY PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S, STRENGTH </p><p>AND POPULARITY VERSUS THE MDC.  THERE WAS AN INTENSE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN PERIOD MARRED BY VIOLENCE BETWEEN </p><p>ZANU-PF AND MDC SUPPORTERS, WHICH CULMINATED IN A </p><p>CONFRONTATION THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF A BYSTANDER, </p><p>KILLED BY A STRAY BULLET.  A PLANNED VISIT TO THE </p><p>DISTRICT BY MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TO ADDRESS A </p><p>CAMPAIGN RALLY WAS CANCELLED, BECAUSE OF CONCERN THAT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S SAFETY COULD NOT BE GUARANTEED AND THAT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>VIOLENCE MIGHT ERUPT.  AFTER THIS INTENSE CAMPAIGN, LESS </p><p>THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE REGISTERED VOTERS WENT TO THE </p><p>POLLS.  THE NOVEMBER 28 ISSUE OF "THE HERALD" REPORTED </p><p>THAT 12,322 VOTERS OUT OF 37,600 REGISTERED VOTERS, OR </p><p>32.88 PERCENT OF THE ELECTORATE, CAST THEIR VOTE.  THIS </p><p>COMPARES TO 16,947 VOTES CAST IN THE DISTRICT IN THE </p><p>JUNE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: WHILE THE VOTING OCCURRED IN A </p><p>RELATIVELY PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT WITH POLL WATCHERS FROM </p><p>BOTH ZANU-PF AND MDC ABLE TO MONITOR THE VOTING, THE </p><p>FACT THAT THE BALLOT WAS PRECEDED BY BIASED MEDIA </p><p>COVERAGE AND A TWO-WEEK CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06658  02 OF 02  282215Z </p><p>VIOLENCE CHIEFLY BY ZANU-PF AND ITS SUPPORTERS, STRONGLY </p><p>SUGGESTS THIS WAS NOT A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IN OUR </p><p>JUDGEMENT.  THE PREVAILING VIEW OF THE MISSION OBSERVERS </p><p>WAS THAT THE PRE-ELECTION INTIMIDATION CLEARLY PLAYED A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PART IN REDUCING VOTER TURNOUT.  EVEN WITH </p><p>THIS PRE-ELECTION INTIMIDATION, AND THE PERSONAL </p><p>INVOLVEMENT OF "HITLER" HUNZVI AND SOLOMON MUJURU, THE </p><p>ZANU-PF CANDIDATE RECEIVED ALMOST 4,000 FEWER VOTES THAN </p><p>HIS PREDECESSOR, WHILE THE MDC CANDIDATE RECEIVED ONLY </p><p>200 FEWER VOTES THAN IN LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  TO US, THIS IS AN INDICATION THAT THE MDC </p><p>HAS HELD ONTO ITS CORE SUPPORT UNDER DIFFICULT </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, WHILE ZANU-PF\'S SUPPORT HAS ERODED.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
