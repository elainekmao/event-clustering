<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 005396 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/25/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MEPP, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: SALEH\'S RHETORIC OVER THE TOP, BUT POLICY UNCHANGED </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 220986 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR BARBARA K. BODINE, REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IN A MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER BA </p><p>JAMMAL NOVEMBER 20, THE AMBASSADOR CONVEYED U.S. CONCERNS </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT SALEH\'S RECENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE </p><p>EXACERBATING AN ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION.  AT SUCH A TENSE </p><p>TIME, THE ROYG SHOULD BE PUBLICLY URGING BOTH SIDES TO RETURN </p><p>TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, NOT FANNING THE FLAMES OF PAN-ARAB </p><p>ANGER.  THE PRESIDENT\'S EXCESSIVE COMMENTS WILL ONLY </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF REJECTIONISTS ON BOTH SIDES.  BA </p><p>JAMMAL EXPLAINED THAT SALEH\'S RHETORICAL EXTRAVAGANCE WAS </p><p>NECESSARY TO SATISFY PRO-PALESTINIAN YEMENI PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>AND FILL A VACUUM THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE FILLED BY THE </p><p>OPPOSITION.  HE STRESSED THAT THE ROYG\'S SUPPORTIVE POLICY </p><p>FOR THE MEPP HAD NOT AND WOULD NOT CHANGE.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>CONTINUED THAT THE GAP BETWEEN YEMENI POLICY AND PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>RHETORIC WAS GROWING TOO WIDE TO BE SUSTAINABLE AS SIMPLY FOR </p><p>DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION.  IT WAS NOT IN THE REGION\'S, THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS\' OR YEMEN\'S BEST INTEREST THAT THIS CONTINUE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>U.S. RESERVATIONS ON RECENT RHETORIC </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DURING HER NOVEMBER 20 MEETING WITH DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER/FOREIGN MINISTER ABDUL QADIR BA JAMMAL (OTHER TOPICS </p><p>SEPTEL), AMBASSADOR, PER REFTEL, RAISED GROWING U.S. CONCERNS </p><p>OVER THE INCREASINGLY SHARP TONE OF PRESIDENT SALEH\'S PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS ON REGIONAL ISSUES IN GENERAL AND THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>PEACE PROCESS IN PARTICULAR.  THE PRESIDENT\'S RECENT COMMENTS </p><p>ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF JIHAD, HIS ASSERTION THAT ARMED </p><p>RESISTANCE WAS THE ONLY VIABLE PALESTINIAN OPTION AND HIS </p><p>PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF REGRET -- REPEATED ON AT LEAST TWO </p><p>OCCASIONS -- THAT YEMEN DID NOT BORDER ISRAEL AND THEREFORE </p><p>COULD NOT PROVIDE ARMS FOR THE INTIFADA, WERE </p><p>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO STOP THE </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  THEY ALSO APPEARED TO </p><p>CONTRADICT OFFICIAL ROYG POLICY OF SUPPORT FOR THE MEPP. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>BA JAMMAL:  IT\'S RHETORIC, NOT SUBSTANCE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  BA JAMMAL DOWNPLAYED THE SERIOUSNESS OF SALEH\'S </p><p>REMARKS, ESPECIALLY THOSE EXPRESSING REGRET AT YEMEN\'S NOT </p><p>BEING A BORDERLINE STATE, ADDING THAT HE HAD QUICKLY </p><p>CLARIFIED THE LATTER IN SUBSEQUENT PRESS INTERVIEWS, DENYING </p><p>THAT YEMEN WAS CALLING FOR WAR AND RESTATING THAT THE </p><p>PEACEFUL RECOGNITION OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS REMAINED A </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL PRECEPT OF YEMENI FOREIGN POLICY.  HE EXPLAINED </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S RHETORICAL EXTRAVAGANCE AS AN UNAVOIDABLE </p><p>POLITICAL REALITY:  AS AN ARAB LEADER, SALEH IS OBLIGED TO </p><p>ENTHUSIASTICALLY EMBRACE PAN-ARAB SOLIDARITY DURING PERIODS </p><p>OF PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CONFRONTATION.  ALSO, THE YEMENI </p><p>PUBLIC IS OUTRAGED OVER WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS ISRAEL\'S USE OF </p><p>EXCESSIVE FORCE AGAINST PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS; TO APPEAR SOFT </p><p>ON ISRAEL WOULD OPEN THE GOVERNMENT TO ATTACKS FROM THE </p><p>DOMESTIC OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR:  RHETORIC MATTERS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR CHARACTERIZED SALEH\'S RECENT PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS AS FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE AND INTOLERANT THAN THEY </p><p>HAD EVER BEEN AND WELL BEYOND THOSE EMANATING FROM MOST OTHER </p><p>ARAB CAPITALS.  IN FACT, BA JAMMAL HAD HIMSELF EARLIER </p><p>DISPARAGED IRAQ\'S CALLING FOR A JIHAD AND A WAR OF AGGRESSION </p><p>AGAINST ISRAEL.  REGRETTABLY, PRESIDENT SALEH\'S PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS WERE PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO BAGHDAD\'S. THIS HAD BEEN </p><p>NOTICED IN WASHINGTON, WHERE EVENYEMEN\'S FRIENDS WERE </p><p>BECOMING INCREASINGLY WORRIE ABOUT THE EXTREME NATURE OF </p><p>SOME OF SALEH\'S COMENTS.  SUCH STRIDENT RHETORIC ONLY SERVED </p><p>TO ENCURAGE VIOLENT REJECTIONISTS ON THE PALESTINIAN SID </p><p>AND CONFIRM HARD-LINE ISRAELI CLAIMS THAT ALL AABS WANT WAR </p><p>WITH ISRAEL.  GIVEN THE VOLATILITY O THE CURRENT SITUATION, </p><p>OFFICIAL ROYG STATEMENTSSHOULD BE URGING BOTH SIDES TO </p><p>RETURN TO PEACEFU NEGOTIATION, NOT EXHORTING MUSLIMS TO </p><p>JIHAD OR ALESTINIANS TO VIOLENT RESISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>ROYG POLICY UNCHANGED:  SUPPORT FOR THE MEPP </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  BA JAMMAL DEMURRED, CLAIMING THAT OTHER ARAB EADERS </p><p>HAD ISSUED SIMILARLY STRONG PUBLIC STATEMNTS.  SALEH </p><p>SHOULDN\'T BE SINGLED OUT.  POINTING OT THAT HE HAD </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY PREVENTED ANTI-MEPP LNGUAGE FROM BEING INCLUDED </p><p>IN THE OIC SUMMIT\'S FNAL COMMUNIQUE, BA JAMMAL INSISTED THAT </p><p>THE ROYGS SUPPORTIVE POLICY FOR THE PEACE PROCESS HAD NOT </p><p>AND WOULD NOT CHANGE.  PEACEFUL NEGOTIATION WAS TH ONLY WAY </p><p>TO ACHIEVE A JUST, LASTING PEACE BETWEN ISRAEL AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  AT THE SAME TIME THE U.S. MUST UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT THE YEMENI LEADERHIP IS UNDER TREMENDOUS PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>PRESSURE;THE YEMENI STREET HAS TO BE APPEASED.  SALEH\'S </p><p>REENT RHETORIC REFLECTS A "COMPETITION" BETWEEN THE ROYG AND </p><p>THE DOMESTIC OPPOSITION FOR THE PUBLIC\'S FAVOR, NOT A POLICY </p><p>SHIFT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR WARNED BA JAMMAL THAT A CONTINUATION </p><p>OF SALEH\'S RHETORIC RISKED BEING INTERPRETED IN WASHINGTON AS </p><p>AN INDICATION THAT ROYG POLICY HAS CHANGED OR IS IN THE </p><p>PROCESS OF CHANGING.  BA JAMMAL TOOK THE POINT, BUT </p><p>DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN ROYG STRATEGY (OVERALL SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>MEPP AND PEACEFUL NEGOTIATION) AND TACTICS (BUYING TIME BY </p><p>APPEASING PUBLIC ANGER).  THE AMBASSADOR CONCLUDED BY </p><p>SUGGESTING THAT IT WOULD BE IN EVERYONE\'S INTEREST IF THE </p><p>ROYG BEGAN TO FOCUS ON STRATEGY RATHER THAN TACTICS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  SALEH\'S DESIRE TO BURNISH HIS PAN-ARAB CREDENTIALS </p><p>AND AVOID OPENING HIMSELF TO ATTACKS FROM THE OPPOSITION IS </p><p>PREDICTABLE, IF LAMENTATBLE.  OPPOSITION (AND ESPECIALLY </p><p>ISLAAH) CRITICISM OF THE ROYG\'S DECISION EARLIER THIS YEAR TO </p><p>REVISE ITS TRAVEL POLICY TO ALLOW YEMENI-ORIGIN ISRAELIS TO </p><p>RETURN HOME ON LAISSEZ-PASSER WAS PARTICULARLY NASTY.  AS A </p><p>RESULT, THE NEW POLICY HAD TO BE SUSPENDED.  SALEH MUST ALSO </p><p>CAREFULLY MANAGE THE PUBLIC OPINION ASPECTS OF THE U.S. </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE PRESENCE IN YEMEN FOLLOWING THE OCTOBER 12 </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE USS COLE IN ADEN HARBOR.  TAKING </p><p>HARD-LINE STANCES ON REGIONAL ISSUES GIVES SALEH THE </p><p>POLITICAL COVER HE NEEDS FOR THE CLOSE AND ONGOING </p><p>YEMENI-U.S. JOINT INVESTIGATION.  THAT SAID, HIS RECENT </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON IRAQ AND THE MEPP ARE WELL BEYOND THE </p><p>PALE EVEN IF THEY REFLECT SALEH\'S MERCURIAL AND COMBATIVE </p><p>NATURE RATHER THAN A SHIFT IN ROYG POLICY.  AMBASSADOR HAS </p><p>REQUESTED AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT TO DISCUSS U.S. </p><p>CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BODINE </p><p></p></div>
