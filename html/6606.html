(U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PLEASE PROTECT </p><p>ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary and Introduction: DUSTR Jon Huntsman led </p><p>the U.S. delegation and Vice Minister of Trade Luong Van Tu </p><p>headed the GVN side at the plenary session of the second </p><p>annual meeting of the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) Joint </p><p>Committee in Hanoi March 10. Expert level sessions led by </p><p>Elena Bryan, USTR Senior Director for Southeast Asia and the </p><p>Pacific, and Nguyen Thu Do, Deputy Director, Office of the </p><p>Government for the GVN were held March 4-5.  Other USG </p><p>participants in the Joint Committee meetings included </p><p>Ambassador, EconCouns, USPTO, DOC, US Customs, and Emboffs. </p><p>The GVN participants included representatives from the </p><p>Ministries of Finance, Planning and Investment, Trade, </p><p>Fisheries, Culture and Information and Justice.  The U.S. </p><p>side emphasized that it had fully implemented all of its BTA </p><p>obligations upon entry-into-force of the agreement.  The </p><p>GVN, while acknowledging shortcomings in implementing some </p><p>obligations, pointed out it has made significant progress in </p><p>implementing its BTA obligations and frequently cited its </p><p>ongoing cooperation with USG technical assistance providers. </p><p>The U.S. side focused on issues related to GVN </p><p>implementation of BTA commitments on transparency, </p><p>intellectual property rights (IPR), market access for </p><p>services, investment, and trade in goods.  The GVN focused </p><p>on issues related to business facilitation, trademark </p><p>applications, anti-dumping, textiles and sanitary and phyto- </p><p>sanitary (SPS) measures.  This cable summarizes the Joint </p><p>Committee\'s review of BTA implementation chapter by chapter. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>Chapter I:  Trade in Goods </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) SPS:  The GVN delegation noted the continued </p><p>interest in working with USG technical assistance providers </p><p>to learn how to implement the SPS provisions in the BTA. </p><p>The GVN also expressed an interest in discussing a bilateral </p><p>protocol on SPS.  The U.S. delegation noted that SPS is an </p><p>important area both in terms of BTA implementation as well </p><p>as WTO accession. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) CUSTOMS VALUATION:  The U.S. side emphasized that </p><p>customs valuation is a key BTA obligation and strongly urged </p><p>the GVN to begin working now to have all the necessary </p><p>legislation (including implementing legislation) in place to </p><p>begin applying transaction value by the end of 2003.  The </p><p>GVN stated it would start to implement this obligation </p><p>toward the end of 2003, but admitted it did not know how </p><p>long it would take to implement.  The GVN also said it had </p><p>instructed Vietnam\'s Customs authority to be prepared to </p><p>meet this obligation and asserted that the GVN would be </p><p>ready to begin using transaction value by the end of 2003, </p><p>as obligated under the BTA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) TARIFFS:  The U.S. delegation raised concerns about </p><p>a lack of transparency regarding tariff rates.  The lack of </p><p>an applied tariff schedule creates uncertainty for U.S. </p><p>traders and many have complained to the USG that Vietnam\'s </p><p>tariff rates change with little or no notice.  The GVN </p><p>responded that it is policy to provide 30 days notice of </p><p>tariff rate changes (excluding petroleum tariffs), but noted </p><p>that problems with customs classification and inspections </p><p>have made it difficult to ensure that 30 days notice is </p><p>always given.  The GVN also advised the best way to </p><p>determine a specific tariff rate in Vietnam is to check with </p><p>customs officials at the port of entry.  The GVN added that </p><p>whenever tariff rates are changed, the GVN publishes the new </p><p>rates in newspapers and an official digest.  The U.S. side </p><p>responded that the GVN needs to be more transparent about </p><p>tariff rates and advised the GVN to put the applied rates on </p><p>a website traders could refer to easily. </p><p> </p><p>Chapter II: Intellectual Property Rights </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) LEGISLATION:  The GVN noted it had passed and </p><p>amended various IP-related legislation in 2002 including </p><p>legislation related to copyright royalties, plant variety </p><p>registration, copyright for architectural works, layout </p><p>designs and integrated circuits.  In addition, the GVN </p><p>described activities it had undertaken to increase public </p><p>and official awareness of IPR issues including training, </p><p>seminars, and workshops. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) ENFORCEMENT:  The U.S. delegation emphasized that </p><p>IPR is a very important issue to the U.S. and the USG places </p><p>a lot of emphasis on effective enforcement.  IP enforcement </p><p>is also critical not only to attracting and retaining </p><p>investment, but also to facilitating development of IT, arts </p><p>and other sectors.  The U.S. side asserted that Vietnam </p><p>should have the capacity for strong enforcement of IPR given </p><p>that the GVN is already very effective at keeping </p><p>"culturally offensive" items out of stores.  The U.S. side </p><p>noted that raids on stores selling pirated Microsoft goods </p><p>in 2002 were a good start, but these raids also clearly </p><p>demonstrated weaknesses in Vietnamese enforcement tactics as </p><p>only a few stores were targeted, not all materials were </p><p>confiscated, and the stores quickly re-opened and resumed </p><p>selling pirated goods.  The U.S. delegation also highlighted </p><p>that in other countries IPR crime is often linked to illicit </p><p>trafficking of drugs and weapons.  Thus, as other countries </p><p>in the region improve their legislation and enforcement </p><p>activities, Vietnam may find these criminals moving to </p><p>Vietnam because they believe it is relatively easier to </p><p>function there.  The U.S. delegation also noted that other </p><p>countries have found it useful to form a committee composed </p><p>of representatives of the various ministries responsible for </p><p>IP enforcement to oversee enforcement efforts. </p><p>8. (SBU) TRADEMARK REGISTRATION IN THE U.S.:  The U.S. </p><p>delegation briefed the GVN on the procedures for registering </p><p>trademarks in the U.S., including providing information on </p><p>the procedures for dealing with competing applications for </p><p>the same trademark.  The U.S. side offered to organize a </p><p>video teleconference for GVN officials with the U.S. Patent </p><p>and Trademark Office as well as training on how to access </p><p>and use the USPTO website.  The GVN asked questions about </p><p>"cyber-squatting" and the costs associated with registering </p><p>a trademark in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>Chapter III: Services </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) FINANCIAL SERVICES:  The U.S. side noted that the </p><p>GVN has not fulfilled a BTA obligation (Annex G, Part 6, </p><p>item E) to allow U.S. bank branches to accept deposits from </p><p>Vietnamese "natural persons" in a ratio of 100 percent of </p><p>paid-in-capital.  The GVN responded that it would raise the </p><p>issue with the State Bank. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) DECREE ON LAWYERS:  The GVN informed the U.S. side </p><p>that the GVN expects to submit the draft Decree on Lawyers </p><p>to the National Assembly in June 2003.  The U.S. noted our </p><p>concern that the last draft provided had included a non-BTA </p><p>compliant provision that would prohibit Vietnamese lawyers </p><p>hired by a foreign law firms from arguing cases in court, </p><p>thus in effect disenfranchising Vietnamese lawyers who work </p><p>for foreigners.  The GVN informed the U.S. that, in response </p><p>to concerns raised by the U.S. and foreign lawyers, this </p><p>earlier provision had in fact been removed from the final </p><p>draft.  In addition, the GVN, in cooperation with U.S. </p><p>technical assistance providers, has been providing training </p><p>and information to legal officers in Hanoi as well as in the </p><p>provinces. </p><p> </p><p>Chapter IV: Investment </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) IMPROVEMENTS TO INVESTMENT REGIME:  The GVN cited </p><p>numerous changes it has made to fulfill its obligations </p><p>under the Investment chapter of the BTA.  These included: </p><p>phasing out regulations on foreign exchange 5 years earlier </p><p>than required; authorizing land use rights for credit </p><p>institution joint ventures three years earlier than </p><p>required; taking steps toward unifying dual pricing for </p><p>water, electricity and transportation; and allowing 100 </p><p>percent U.S.-owned insurance companies to operate.  (Note: </p><p>only one U.S. insurance company has been granted a license </p><p>to operate, three other applications from U.S. firms are </p><p>pending approval.)  The GVN also noted that a new decree </p><p>allowing foreign joint ventures to be joint stock companies </p><p>would be promulgated soon.  The GVN said that it planned to </p><p>unify foreign and domestic investment laws.  In the interim, </p><p>the GVN had submitted amendments to Decree 24 (guidelines on </p><p>permissible foreign investment) to address shortcomings in </p><p>current foreign investment law, although, the GVN admitted, </p><p>the changes in Decree 24 are not "fully satisfactory" to </p><p>meet BTA obligations (e.g. do not address board of directors </p><p>and exchange of shares issues). </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) FORD/GM AND AUTO TARIFFS:  The U.S. side argued </p><p>that a draft Ministry of Finance decision to raise import </p><p>duties on auto parts and increase the special consumption </p><p>tax on domestically produced autos will make it difficult </p><p>for the 11 major auto manufacturers currently in Vietnam to </p><p>remain in the market.  The U.S. delegation urged the GVN to </p><p>continue its dialogue with representatives of the auto </p><p>sector to find a way forward that works for both sides.  It </p><p>emphasized that the outcome of the auto issue will be an </p><p>early example of how well the U.S.-Vietnam commercial </p><p>relationship will progress. The U.S. side also noted that </p><p>the MOF decision raises questions about the GVN\'s </p><p>"preservation of investor rights" and TRIMs obligations </p><p>under the BTA and could negatively impact Vietnam\'s WTO </p><p>accession.  The GVN responded that it had consulted with the </p><p>auto producers and that it would be difficult to find a </p><p>solution that will satisfy all parties. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) MCCULLAGH/KRONG ANA:  The U.S. side noted the case </p><p>where a U.S. company (McCullagh) had the approval of the </p><p>Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) to buy out its </p><p>local partner but was being obstructed by the provincial </p><p>government.  The U.S. side thanked MPI for its efforts to </p><p>resolve this case over the past year and urged MPI to submit </p><p>the case to a higher authority for resolution.  The U.S. </p><p>side noted that although the U.S. investor in this case had </p><p>lost faith in the provincial government, it had not yet lost </p><p>confidence in the ability of the central government to </p><p>resolve the case.  The U.S. side also emphasized that the </p><p>central government bears full responsibility for ensuring </p><p>the BTA is implemented - even at the provincial level.  The </p><p>GVN noted that the Prime Minister had just sent a dispatch </p><p>to the Dak Lak provincial authorities asking them to resolve </p><p>the issue. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) ENFORCEMENT OF ARBITRAL AWARDS/TYCO:  The U.S. </p><p>side complemented the landmark decision of the Economic </p><p>Court in HCMC to enforce an arbitral award for a U.S. </p><p>company (Tyco) and noted that this action had been viewed </p><p>widely by the international community as a very important </p><p>event in Vietnam.  However, the Supreme Court\'s subsequent </p><p>decision to overturn the Economic Court\'s decision may lead </p><p>U.S. investors to question whether or not they will be able </p><p>seek protection under the BTA and the New York Convention. </p><p>The U.S. side expressed hope that upon higher review of the </p><p>case, Tyco will be treated fairly and in a transparent </p><p>manner.  The U.S. side also offered to provide additional </p><p>training for judicial officials on arbitration procedures. </p><p>The GVN said it would appoint staff to watch the case but </p><p>noted that, as in the U.S., judicial decisions are subject </p><p>to Vietnamese law and the GVN cannot override them. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) DECISION 718/TRIMS:  The U.S. noted that at the </p><p>first BTA Joint Committee, we had raised the issue of the </p><p>December 2001 Decision 718 which increased the number of </p><p>sectors where foreign investments are subject to export </p><p>requirements and noted this decision contradicted BTA TRIMs </p><p>obligations.  The U.S expressed its pleasure that no U.S. </p><p>firm had reported that the GVN had tried to apply this </p><p>decision, but noted it was still on the books without any </p><p>clarification that it did not apply to U.S. companies per </p><p>the BTA.  The GVN agreed to provide clarification in writing </p><p>to the Embassy that the export requirements put in place in </p><p>December 2001 (under Decision 718) in sectors not explicitly </p><p>included in Vietnam\'s national treatment exceptions under </p><p>the BTA would not apply to U.S. companies. </p><p> </p><p>Chapter V:  Business Facilitation </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) VISAS:  The GVN argued that since September 11, </p><p>2001 it has become more difficult for Vietnamese in general </p><p>and Vietnamese enterprises in particular to get visas to do </p><p>business in the U.S.  While acknowledging U.S. security </p><p>concerns, the GVN emphasized that new visa procedures make </p><p>it difficult for Vietnamese enterprises to take advantage of </p><p>opportunities created by the BTA.  The GVN specifically </p><p>cited long waiting periods, last-minute notifications and </p><p>vague reasons for refusal.  The Vietnamese side noted that </p><p>its embassy in Washington was making efforts to facilitate </p><p>business travel to Vietnam and usually issued business visas </p><p>within 24-48 hours.  The U.S. side agreed that this was a </p><p>serious issue, noted that the new rules applied to all </p><p>countries, not just Vietnam, said the Embassy facilitates </p><p>visa issuances in accordance with U.S. law and noted that </p><p>issuance of business visas in Hanoi and HCMC has actually </p><p>increased 35-40 percent in 2002.  The U.S. side also noted </p><p>that in 2002 only 30 cases in HCMC and 27 cases in Hanoi </p><p>were seriously delayed because of the clearance process. </p><p> </p><p>Chapter VI:  Transparency </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) REVISED LAW ON LAWS:  The U.S. side noted that the </p><p>revised Law on the Promulgation of Legal Normative Documents </p><p>("Law on Laws") does not define official letters, </p><p>instructions or guidelines as legal normative documents and </p><p>asked whether the GVN planned to make these kinds of </p><p>documents public as required under the BTA\'s transparency </p><p>obligations.  The GVN responded that although the revised </p><p>Law on Laws was the result of cooperation between the GVN </p><p>and Vietnamese and international legal experts, both U.S. </p><p>and Vietnamese experts were not yet satisfied with the law. </p><p>The GVN is working with the U.S. Support for Trade </p><p>AcceleRation (STAR) project to identify shortcomings in the </p><p>revised law and to introduce provincial-level versions of </p><p>the Law on Laws.  The Vietnamese side noted that introducing </p><p>transparency is a "process" that takes time and needs to be </p><p>done step by step to ensure Vietnamese law is in compliance </p><p>with international practices. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) The U.S. side welcomed the positive steps taken on </p><p>transparency but advised the GVN that Vietnam\'s transparency </p><p>obligations were due upon entry-into-force of the BTA </p><p>(December 2001) and the USG expects BTA-level treatment to </p><p>apply to all U.S. firms and investors.  The U.S. delegation </p><p>also noted that transparency is critical for attracting </p><p>foreign investment.  Investors want to know what the rules </p><p>and regulations are and be sure that they will be </p><p>consistently applied.  The GVN responded that there had been </p><p>changes to the way legislation is drafted.  Draft </p><p>legislation is open for comment from the public and </p><p>enterprises before it is submitted to the National Assembly, </p><p>which also accepts additional comments on draft legislation. </p><p> </p><p>Other Issues </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) "CATFISH":  The GVN noted the "catfish" situation </p><p>has "gotten worse" since the first meeting of the BTA Joint </p><p>Committee in 2002.  The Department of Commerce ruling that </p><p>Vietnam is a non-market economy (NME) is unfair and the </p><p>preliminary tariff rates (although some had been adjusted </p><p>down) are too high.  The GVN cited several reasons why </p><p>Vietnamese frozen fish companies are not guilty of dumping </p><p>their product in the U.S. market:  1) Vietnamese enterprises </p><p>are too poor to dump their product; 2) Vietnamese fish </p><p>companies benefit from good technology and low production </p><p>costs; 3) the price of Vietnamese catfish in the U.S. market </p><p>is the same or higher than the price of Vietnamese catfish </p><p>in other markets; and 4) catfish producers do not receive </p><p>state subsidies.  The GVN urged the DOC to take a fairer </p><p>approach to calculating the costs, particularly with respect </p><p>to 1) ensuring the DOC takes into account all stages </p><p>involved in the process of producing frozen fish fillets and </p><p>2) using the retail, not wholesale price when calculating </p><p>costs in the surrogate country.  The GVN also raised </p><p>concerns about a potential dumping case against Vietnamese </p><p>exports of shrimp.  The U.S. delegation noted its </p><p>willingness to listen to GVN concerns about the catfish case </p><p>but clarified that 1) this was not a BTA issue and 2) </p><p>dumping investigations follow an established legal process </p><p>and the GVN needs to continue to deal directly with ITA on </p><p>anti-dumping issues.  Separately, the U.S. side explained </p><p>that recent dumping decisions in neighboring countries (e.g. </p><p>China/honey) could have an adverse impact on Vietnam if it </p><p>becomes a transshipment location and advised the GVN to </p><p>report any cases of suspected transshipment of goods (to </p><p>avoid anti-dumping charges against Vietnam) to Customs via </p><p>the Embassy in Hanoi. </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) CHLORAMPHENICOL:  The GVN raised concerns that the </p><p>U.S. (and EU) are using standards on levels of </p><p>Chloramphenicol in seafood as a "hidden excuse" to protect </p><p>the U.S. domestic seafood industry.  The U.S. delegation </p><p>responded that this is a health and safety issue and the </p><p>U.S. does not use SPS procedures to hinder trade. </p><p> </p><p>21. TEXTILES:  The GVN asked that the USG reconsider </p><p>including extraneous issues such as labor in a bilateral </p><p>textile agreement.  Bilateral discussion on labor issues </p><p>should be conducted in the context of the USDOL-Ministry of </p><p>Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) bilateral MOU on </p><p>labor.  The GVN also argued that textile quota levels should </p><p>be based on Vietnamese production capacity.  The GVN noted </p><p>that it had already proposed to have the second round of </p><p>negotiations take place in the first half of April in </p><p>Washington and it was currently working on a counter- </p><p>proposal on quota levels.  The U.S. side responded that </p><p>these textile negotiations are taking place against a </p><p>backdrop of economic difficulty for the U.S. textile </p><p>industry.  In the last 15 months more than 50 textile </p><p>factories have closed in the U.S. and Vietnam\'s textile </p><p>exports have already surpassed other exporting countries in </p><p>the region, like Indonesia and the Philippines.  The U.S. </p><p>side urged the GVN to provide a counter proposal to USTR </p><p>quickly.  The U.S. side also noted that the proposed labor </p><p>language in the draft textile agreement is a positive </p><p>affirmation of Vietnam\'s commitment to progress on labor </p><p>issues and will reassure importers that Vietnamese factories </p><p>will respect minimum labor standards. </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) WTO ACCESSION:  The U.S. side noted that </p><p>implementation of the BTA provides a solid foundation for </p><p>Vietnam\'s WTO accession.  The pace of accession is up to the </p><p>GVN but the U.S. is willing to help in any way it can.  The </p><p>U.S. side encouraged the GVN to work with WTO members and </p><p>respond quickly to questions. </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU) DISPUTE SETTLEMENT:  The GVN suggested </p><p>establishing a subcommittee to handle dispute settlement as </p><p>bilateral issues arise.  The U.S. side responded that </p><p>"dispute settlement" has a very specific legal meaning in </p><p>the WTO context that is not appropriate for bilateral </p><p>commercial disputes.  In addition, aside from a provision </p><p>for arbitration of commercial disputes, the BTA does not </p><p>contain a dispute settlement mechanism.  The U.S. side </p><p>noted, however, that it is always willing to discuss issues </p><p>of bilateral concern. </p><p> </p><p>MINUTES </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>24. (U) The following is the official text of the minutes of </p><p>the Joint Committee meeting. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>Joint Committee on Development of Economic and Trade </p><p>Relations Between Vietnam and the United States </p><p>Second Working Session Minutes </p><p> </p><p>Hanoi, 4-10 March 2003 </p><p> </p><p>From 4-10 March 2003, the second working session of the </p><p>Joint Committee on Development of Economic and Trade </p><p>Relations between Vietnam and the United States was co- </p><p>chaired in Hanoi by Vice Minister of Trade of Vietnam Mr. </p><p>Luong Van Tu and Deputy United States Trade Representative </p><p>Mr. Jon Huntsman, Jr.  A list of delegates and participants </p><p>who represent various ministries and agencies relating to </p><p>the implementation of the agreement is provided in the </p><p>attached annex. </p><p> </p><p>The two sides reviewed the implementation process in the </p><p>year 2002 and discussed progress and challenges of </p><p>implementation and ways in which to address issues of mutual </p><p>concern.  The U.S. side acknowledged Vietnam\'s efforts to </p><p>comply with BTA provisions and committed to further support </p><p>Vietnam in this process.  The U.S. side urged Vietnam to </p><p>continue its efforts to meet the timetable for </p><p>implementation contained in the BTA. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. emphasized the importance of IPR enforcement.  The </p><p>U.S. side was pleased to hear of Vietnam\'s determination to </p><p>enforce IPR and to learn of recent enforcement actions by </p><p>Vietnam to establish order in this area. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam expressed its desire to actively start discussions </p><p>towards a Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary trade protocol. </p><p> </p><p>The two sides recognized the importance of BTA </p><p>implementation as a contribution to WTO accession.  The U.S. </p><p>side reiterated its support for Vietnam\'s efforts to join </p><p>the WTO.  The two sides looked forward to the WTO working </p><p>party meeting in May 2003 and bilateral discussions at that </p><p>time. </p><p> </p><p>The two sides reviewed the status of bilateral textile </p><p>negotiations and expressed a desire to work together to meet </p><p>a mutually satisfactory result. </p><p> </p><p>The Vietnamese side highlighted its concerns and </p><p>frustrations with the ongoing anti-dumping investigation </p><p>against Vietnam\'s exports of frozen fish fillets (tra and </p><p>basa) to the U.S.  The U.S. side encouraged Vietnam to </p><p>continue working with the U.S. Department of Commerce\'s </p><p>Import Administration on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>The two sides discussed a variety of issues of concern to </p><p>businesses in the two countries and agreed to consult on </p><p>such matters on a regular basis in order to facilitate and </p><p>strengthen the bilateral economic relationship.  They agreed </p><p>to use all available channels of communication, including </p><p>through their embassies in both capitals, to accomplish </p><p>this. </p><p> </p><p>The two sides appreciated the quality discussions of the </p><p>second working session, and strongly believed the U.S.- </p><p>Vietnam economic and trade relations will continue to be </p><p>strengthened on the basis of the BTA. </p><p> </p><p>The two sides agreed that the third working session of the </p><p>U.S. Vietnam Joint Committee will be held in the United </p><p>States in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. side appreciated the hospitality and preparation </p><p>made by Vietnam toward a successful working session. </p><p> </p><p>Signed in Hanoi, 10th MArch 2003. </p><p> </p><p>For the Government of Vietnam </p><p>Luong Van Tu </p><p>Vice Minister of Trade </p><p> </p><p>For the Government of the United States of America </p><p>Jon M.
