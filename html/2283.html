<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIJING 011971 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: CHINA: 2001 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 198912 </p><p> </p><p>1.  BELOW IS THE 2001 TERRORISM REPORT FOR CHINA. </p><p>RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REFTEL PARAGRAPH TWO </p><p>REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  A)  CHINA STRONGLY AND PROMPTLY CONDEMNED THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, WHICH PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN </p><p>DESCRIBED ON SEPTEMBER 12 AS AN ATTACK BOTH ON THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND ON WORLD PEACE.  IT PROVIDED STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE PASSAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1368 </p><p>AND 1373.  AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF U.S. MILITARY </p><p>ACTION IN AFGHANISTAN, THE MFA STATED THAT CHINA </p><p>SUPPORTED ACTION THAT STRIKES AT TERRORISM, WHILE NOTING </p><p>THAT RELATED MILITARY ACTIVITY SHOULD BE DIRECTED AT </p><p>SPECIFIC TARGETS AND AVOID HURTING INNOCENT CIVILIANS. </p><p>CHINA ALSO TOOK STEPS TO TIGHTEN CONTROL OF ITS BORDERS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN.  AS HOST </p><p>OF THE 2001 ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION FORUM, </p><p>CHINA JOINED IN THE APEC LEADERS\' STATEMENT ON </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM, WHICH CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, </p><p>PLEDGED TO FULLY IMPLEMENT UNSCRS 1368 AND 1373, AND </p><p>CALLED FOR THE EARLY RATIFICATION OF THE UNIVERSAL ANTI- </p><p>TERRORIST CONVENTIONS.  AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, THE PRC </p><p>AGREED TO UNDERTAKE REGULAR COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES TO DISCUSS WAYS TO </p><p>IMPROVE BILATERAL COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM.  TWO </p><p>ROUNDS HAVE BEEN HELD THUS FAR. </p><p> </p><p>B)  N/A </p><p> </p><p>C)  THERE WERE NO ACTS OF TERRORISM COMMITTED IN CHINA </p><p>THIS YEAR AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THERE WERE A FEW REPORTS OF BOMBINGS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF </p><p>CHINA DURING THE YEAR, THESE APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>CRIMINAL ACTS, RATHER THAN POLITICAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>D,E)  EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY EXTRADITIONS OR REQUESTS </p><p>FOR EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS TO OR FROM CHINA IN 2001. </p><p>THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY IN FORCE BETWEEN THE U.S. </p><p>AND CHINA.  ON MARCH 8, A MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA ENTERED INTO FORCE. </p><p>THE MLAA WILL ALLOW FOR ENHANCED COOPERATION IN THE </p><p>APPREHENSION AND PROSECUTION OF CRIMINALS, INCLUDING </p><p>TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>F)  AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, CHINA SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED </p><p>INFORMATION SHARING IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, INCLUDING </p><p>THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT CHANNELS, CONCERNING PERSONS </p><p>POSSIBLY RELATED TO TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>G)  CHINA HAS REPEATEDLY EXPRESSED IN INTERNATIONAL FORA </p><p>ITS OPPOSITION TO TERRORISM.  IN ADDITION TO THE PRC\'S </p><p>REACTION TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, CHINESE </p><p>OFFICIALS CONSISTENTLY EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO ACTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND </p><p>OTHER CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES, CHINA IS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>SHANGHAI COOPERATION ORGANIZATION, WHOSE STATED </p><p>OBJECTIVES INCLUDE COMBATING TERRORISM.  CHINA ALSO </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ITS DISCUSSIONS OF </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES IN ITS BILATERAL DIPLOMATIC </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>H)  CHINA DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORISM, TERRORISTS OR </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS, BUT IT DOES MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES DESIGNATED BY THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>I)  CHINA HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENT IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>J)  CHINA BEGAN PLACING A HIGHER PRIORITY ON </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS EVEN PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 11. </p><p>THIS WAS PROBABLY THE RESULT OF UNEASE ABOUT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN, CENTRAL ASIA, AND NEARBY </p><p>AREAS, INCLUDING NORTHWEST CHINA, AND OVER CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT POSSIBLE TERRORIST THREATS TO THE 2001 APEC FORUM </p><p>IN SHANGHAI AND THE BEIJING OLYMPICS IN 2008.  AFTER THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, THE PROMINENCE AND INTENSITY OF </p><p>CHINA\'S COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>K)  AS DISCUSSED IN SECTION A ABOVE, THE U.S. AND CHINA </p><p>HAVE HELD TWO ROUNDS OF COUNTERTERRORISM CONSULTATIONS </p><p>SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, AND ARE COOPERATING TO SHARE </p><p>INFORMATION AND FURTHER COUNTERTERRORISM WORK IN THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS.  CHINA HAS ALSO PLEDGED TO FULLY </p><p>IMPLEMENT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF UNSCR 1373, INCLUDING </p><p>THE FREEZING OF TERRORISTS\' ASSETS.  ON DECEMBER 6, THE </p><p>MFA ANNOUNCED THAT A "SERIOUS INVESTIGATION" HAD </p><p>DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO ASSETS LINKED TO </p><p>TERRORISTS IN CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>L)  N/A </p><p> </p><p>M)  AT U.S. REQUEST, CHINESE AUTHORITIES CLOSED </p><p>SIDEWALKS AND STREETS AROUND U.S. GOVERNMENT FACILITIES </p><p>IN CHINA AFTER SEPTEMBER 11.  CHINESE AUTHORITIES ALSO </p><p>PLEDGED TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TO SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR </p><p>ACTIONS, AND DID SO ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MARINE </p><p></p></div>
