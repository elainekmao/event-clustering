THE </p><p>SPEECH RECEIVED FRONT-PAGE COVERAGE IN ALL OF JORDAN\'S </p><p>ARABIC DAILIES ON THE 13TH, WITH REPORTING BASED ON </p><p>WIRE SERVICE REPORTS.   SUBSEQUENTLY, THE INITIATIVE </p><p>HAS BEEN A MAIN SUBJECT FOR JORDANIAN COMMENTATORS. </p><p>EARLY REPORTING CARRIED STATEMENTS BY JORDAN\'S KING </p><p>ABDULLAH II WELCOMING THE INITIATIVE, AND INDICATING </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN SUPPORTS THE MAIN AIMS OF </p><p>THE INITIATIVE AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST.  COMMENTARY HAS BEEN MIXED, WITH MANY </p><p>WRITERS WELCOMING THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IDEAS </p><p>INFORMING THE INITIATIVE INTO PUBLIC DEBATE, WHILE </p><p>REMAINING SUSPICIOUS OF ULTIMATE U.S. MOTIVES AND </p><p>CALLING FOR GREATER "BALANCE" IN U.S. POLICIES TOWARD </p><p>THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARY </p><p> </p><p>-- "MEPI AND THE NEED FOR REFORM" </p><p> </p><p>PROMINENT DAILY COLUMNIST URAIB AL-RANTAWI WROTE IN </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR </p><p>(12/14): "THE NEED FOR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE, AND FISCAL REFORM IN THE ARAB WORLD IS </p><p>REAL, EVEN IF IT IS THE AMERICANS THAT TELL US ABOUT </p><p>IT.  WE SHOULD NOT SUSPEND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WAITING </p><p>FOR A SOLUTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT." </p><p> </p><p>-- "THE ROAD MAP TO DEMOCRACY" </p><p> </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST JAMIL AL-NIMRI WROTE IN INDEPENDENT, </p><p>MASS-APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM (12/14): "WE </p><p>WELCOME THIS POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE POSITION BECAUSE </p><p>WE VALUE DEMOCRACY AND YEARN TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT. </p><p>WE CHALLENGE THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>THIS INITIATIVE AS A PACKAGE, AND WE SHALL ASSUME THAT </p><p>POWELL\'S WORDS SPRING FROM A CONVICTION.  BUT WE MUST </p><p>REPEAT TO THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION FOR THE THOUSANDTH </p><p>TIME THAT THE KEY TO GAINING THE CONFIDENCE OF THE ARAB </p><p>PEOPLES IS THROUGH SOLVING THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM. </p><p>THIS IS NOT NEW, SO WILL THE DIALOGUE OF THE DEAF </p><p>CONTINUE?  ARAB INTELLECTUALS ARE NOW CONVINCED THAT </p><p>THE PROBLEM IS NOT ONE OF CONVINCING THE AMERICAN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, BUT THE LACK OF AN AMERICAN WILL THAT </p><p>IS INDEPENDENT OF ISRAEL\'S WISHES. IN THIS CONTEXT, ANY </p><p>PRESSURE ON ARAB REGIMES WILL FAIL BECAUSE IT WILL BE </p><p>SEEN AS ZIONIST PRESSURE FOR SUSPECT REASONS, AND EVEN </p><p>DEMOCRATS WILL FEEL THE NEED TO ATTACK IT." </p><p> </p><p>-- "MEPI, AN ATTEMPT TO FILL THE GAP OF HOPE" </p><p> </p><p>RAMADAN RAWASHDEH WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI (12/14): "INTERNATIONAL POLITICS IS </p><p>NO LONGER CONCERNED WITH WHAT IS CALLED NATIONAL </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY, BECAUSE GLOBALIZATION ALLOWS THE  FLOW OF </p><p>FUNDS AND INFORMATION WITHOUT CENSORSHIP OR BORDERS AND </p><p>WITHOUT THE CONTROL OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS </p><p>LOSING MUCH OF ITS PREROGATIVES TO BUSINESS GROUPS, </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTIONS, AND THE FREE MEDIA." </p><p> </p><p>-- "THE AMERICAN PROGRAM TO REFORM AND IMPROVE LOGIC" </p><p> </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MAZEN AL-SAKET WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR (12/14): "THE </p><p>PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT SHOULD NOT BE A COVER TO ADDRESS </p><p>THE CAUSES OF HATRED AND ENMITY TOWARDS AMERICAN </p><p>POLICY.

WE WISH SINCERELY THAT HIS CALL IS </p><p>SINCERE, BUT WE ARE CONVINCED THAT IT IS NOTHING BUT A </p><p>SPECIOUS PROPAGANDA EXERCISE TO EMBELLISH THE IMAGE OF </p><p>THE UGLY AMERICAN.  IT IS NOT A CALL FOR GOOD, BUT A </p><p>WAVING OF THE STOUT STICK.  IS DEVELOPMENT IN PALESTINE </p><p>TO BE ACHIEVED BY REOCCUPYING THE LAND AND DESTROYING </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS\' AUTHORITY?  IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE </p><p>SEEKS WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF IRAQIS, WHEN HE </p><p>IS THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SECRETARY WHO SAID OPENLY THAT </p><p>THE DEATH OF HALF A MILLION IRAQI CHILDREN IS </p><p>ACCEPTABLE?  CAN THE LEBANESE BE ASKED TO COOPERATE </p><p>WITH AN INITIATIVE THAT DICTATES TO THEM AND THAT DUBS </p><p>THE HEROES THAT LIBERATED THE SOUTH OF LEBANON AS </p><p>TERRORISTS?  WOULD THIS NOT BE A CALL FOR THE RETURN OF </p><p>THE OCCUPATION?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "WHO IS PREVENTING PALESTINIAN ELECTIONS?" </p><p> </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MAHMOUD AL-RIMAWI WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI (12/14): </p><p>"SINCE SECRETARY POWELL\'S INITIATIVE CALLS FOR REFORMS </p><p>IN THE ARAB WORLD, WE SHOULD TAKE NOTE THAT PEOPLE OF </p><p>THE REGION SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE ELECTIONS. </p><p>IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPOSE THE ONGOING (US-ISRAELI) </p><p>COLLUSION THAT PREVENTS THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST BANK AND </p><p>GAZA FROM HAVING THEIR ELECTIONS.  THIS CONSTITUTES A </p><p>FLAGRANT CONTRADICTION WITH THE AIMS OF THE PRESENT </p><p>INITIATIVE." </p><p> </p><p>-- "ONE MORE ABOUT MEPI" </p><p> </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST URAYB RINTAWI IN CENTER-LEFT </p><p>INFLUENTIAL AL-DUSTOUR ARABIC DAILY COMMENTED FOR A </p><p>SECOND CONSECUTIVE DAY ON MEPI (12/15).  HE VIEWS THE </p><p>THREE "PILLARS" OF THE INITIATIVE, ECONOMIC REFORM, </p><p>POLITICAL REFORM AND EDUCATIONAL REFORM, AND SAYS THAT </p><p>THAT THE AMERICAN VIEWPOINT OF THE ARAB WORLD IN THESE </p><p>FIELDS IS JUSTIFIED.  ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT, RINTAWI </p><p>SAYS THAT THE "ARAB IMAGE THAT SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>PORTRAYED IS AS SHAMEFUL AS IT CAN BE" AND GOES ON TO </p><p>REVIEW THE SECRETARY\'S STATISTICS ABOUT THE </p><p>DETERIORATION OF ARAB ECONOMIES.  ON THE POLITICAL </p><p>FRONT, RINTAWI SAYS THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE.  ON THE </p><p>EDUCATION FRONT, RINTAWI SAYS THE SAME THING.  RINTAWI </p><p>MOVES ON TO JORDAN AND SAYS THAT THE SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>DID NOT MENTION JORDAN WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT PROMISING </p><p>COUNTRIES IN THE FIELD OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM AND </p><p>WONDERS WHETHER "THE PROBLEM IS WITH POWELL OR WITH </p><p>US". </p><p> </p><p>-- "POWELL AND THE ARABS: INCREASING DEMOCRATIC </p><p>IMMUNITY!" </p><p> </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST YASER ZAATREH WRITES IN AL-DUSTOUR </p><p>ABOUT MEPI (12/15).  HE BEGINS BY VIEWING THE ECONOMIC </p><p>STATISTICS QUOTED BY SECRETARY POWELL AND THE CLAIM </p><p>THAT THE DETERIORATION IN THE ARAB WORLD PRODUCED THE </p><p>9/11 ATTACKERS.  ZAATREH ARGUES THAT THE 9/11 ATTACKERS </p><p>DID NOT SUFFER FROM UNEMPLOYMENT OR POVERTY, AND THAT </p><p>THE FACT THAT THEY WERE "LOW ON DEMOCRACY" SHOULD HAVE </p><p>COMPELLED THEM TO ATTACK THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS RATHER </p><p>THAN THE U.S.  HE ASKS SECRETARY POWELL: "DIDN\'T YOUR </p><p>ADVISORS TELL YOU THAT SUCH A DEMOCRACY WILL BRING MORE </p><p>CONTEMPT FOR THE UNITED STATES?"  HE GOES ON TO SAY </p><p>THAT THE US ADMINISTRATION REFUSES TO DEAL WITH FACTS </p><p>ON THE GROUND THAT LED TO THE 9/11 ATTACKS, NAMELY THE </p><p>FACT THAT "THE CONTEMPT FOR THE UNITED STATES STEMS </p><p>ONLY FROM THE UNITED STATES\' HUMILIATION OF ARABS AND </p><p>MUSLIMS, FROM STEALING THEIR WEALTH AND FORTUNE AND </p><p>FROM SUPPORTING THE KILLING OF THEIR CHILDREN IN </p><p>PALESTINE, THE MOST SACRED AND MOST IMPORTANT CAUSE FOR </p><p>THE MUSLIMS." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A FAILING RECIPE FOR A DISTORTED SITUATION" </p><p> </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MUSA HAWAMDEH IN AL-DUSTOUR (12/15) </p><p>ARGUES THAT THE U.S. IS ONLY INTERESTED IN DEMOCRACY IN </p><p>AS FAR AS IT SERVES ITS OWN INTERESTS, THAT THE </p><p>"DEMOCRACY THAT WASHINGTON WANTS IS A DISTORTED KIND OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO OPEN THE ARAB </p><p>LANDS FOR AMERICA FIRST, THEN IT WANTS TO GIVE ORDERS </p><p>AND TO GET RID OF  ANYTHING THAT COULD CREATE ANIMOSITY </p><p>FOR THE UNITED STATES."  HAWAMDEH CONCLUDES THAT THE </p><p>UNITED STATES "WOULD SAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF IT </p><p>WOULD DEAL WITH THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION AS A SOURCE OF </p><p>TERROR AND WORRY, AND IF IT WOULD CONSIDER THE IDEA </p><p>THAT ITS INTERESTS MAY NOT NECESSARILY COME INTO </p><p>CONFLICT WITH ARAB INTERESTS IF IT WOULD BECOME AN </p><p>HONEST COUNTRY AND APPLY UN RESOLUTIONS" TO ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>-- "AN IMPOSED PARTNERSHIP?" </p><p> </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST HILMI AL-ASMAR IN AL-DUSTOUR WONDERS </p><p>(12/15) WHETHER MEPI IS AN "IMPOSED" PARTNERSHIP AND </p><p>WHETHER THE "OTHER PARTNER", THE ARABS, WANTS THAT </p><p>PARTNERSHIP.  AL-ASMAR SAYS THAT HE DOES "NOT HOLD ANY </p><p>PERSONAL GRUDGE AGAINST AMERICA AND ITS CITIZENS.  IN </p><p>FACT I AM JEALOUS OF THEIR GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS AND THEIR </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROGRESS OF HUMANITY."  HE ADDS </p><p>THAT "AT THE SAME TIME, I BELONG TO A PEOPLE WHO SEE </p><p>THEMSELVES AS VICTIMS OF AMERICA, JUST AS MUCH AS THEY </p><p>SEE THEMSELVES VICTIMS OF DILAPIDATING ARAB AND ISLAMIC </p><p>REGIMES WHO ACQUIRED THEIR OPPRESSIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE </p><p>\'LEGITIMACY\' FROM AMERICA\'S UNLIMITED SUPPORT". </p><p> </p><p>-- "WHAT HINDERS DEMOCRACY IN THIS REGION?" </p><p> </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST JAMIL NIMRI WRITES (12/15) IN AL-ARAB </p><p>AL-YAWM ABOUT THE OBSTACLES OF DEMOCRACY IN THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD.  HE SAYS THAT "IF THE REGIMES IN THIS REGION </p><p>WERE TO ABIDE BY WHAT POLLS AND BALLOTS TELL THEM, THEY </p><p>WOULD BE FACING A REAL DISASTER, BECAUSE THE PUBLIC </p><p>WANTS WHAT THESE REGIMES CANNOT ACCEPT, SUCH AS </p><p>FIGHTING ISRAEL AND THE AMERICAN ANTICIPATED WAR ON </p><p>IRAQ."  NIMRI MAINTAINS THAT "THE REGIMES HAVE </p><p>DEVELOPED AN IRON GRIP ON AUTHORITY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT </p><p>TRUST, IN VIEW OF THEIR CURRENT POLICIES THAT ARE </p><p>\'REQUIRED BY THE WEST\', THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO STAY </p><p>IN POWER FOR A DAY IF THE FINAL WORD IS GIVEN BACK TO </p><p>THE PEOPLE."  NIMRI CONTINUES TO ARGUE THAT "NATIONAL </p><p>AND RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM FEEDS OFF THE CONFLICT IN </p><p>PALESTINE" AND THAT "SINCE THE CALL [FOR DEMOCRACY] IS </p><p>COMING FROM THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL\'S ALLY WHO </p><p>ACCEPTS EVEN SHARON\'S BLOODY POLICIES, IT IS DIFFICULT </p><p>TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUPPORT OF DEMOCRACY WITHOUT </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO RESOLVING THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--THE PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE, WHY DID THE REGIMES FAIL </p><p>TO PRODUCE ONE? </p><p> </p><p>COLUMNIST JAMAL AL-TAHAT WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON DECEMBER 16: "THE </p><p>VALUE OF THE INITIATIVE DOES NOT LIE IN THE FUNDS </p><p>ALLOCATED TO IT, BUT IN THE IDEA ON WHICH IT IS BASED. </p><p>BUT IT IS ALSO AN EXPRESSION OF THE TOTAL ARAB FAILURE, </p><p>TO THE POINT WHERE IT SEEMS AS IF THE U.S. IS SIDING </p><p>WITH THE ARABS AGAINST A BACKWARDNESS THAT IS OF THEIR </p><p>MAKING." </p><p> </p><p>-- JORDAN AND THE PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p>PROMINENT DAILY COLUMNIST URAIB AL-RANTAWI WROTE IN </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON </p><p>DECEMBER 16: "JORDAN HAS A NATIONAL INTEREST IN THE </p><p>SUCCESS OF THE AGENDA, REGARDLESS OF WHAT POWELL SAID </p><p>OR DID NOT SAY, AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT ANY OTHERS MAY </p><p>SAY.  ONE SHOULD NOT REST ON THE ASSURANCE OF AMERICA\'S </p><p>FRIENDSHIP BECAUSE NO COUNTRY WAS A CLOSER FRIEND OF </p><p>THE U.S. THAN SAUDI ARABIA, AND RELATIONS BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO HAVE NOW DETERIORATED.  ONE WOULD BE WISE TO SET </p><p>ONE\'S HOUSE IN ORDER BEFORE HE IS COMPELLED TO SET THEM </p><p>IN ORDER ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS." </p><p> </p><p>-- POWELL\'S UNLIMITED COMPANY </p><p>COLUMNIST USAMA AL-SHARIF WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON DECEMBER 16: </p><p>"THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS NO ARAB PROPOSAL </p><p>THAT WE MAY RAISE IN THE FACE OF SECRETARY POWELL TO </p><p>SAY TO HIM: `THESE ARE OUR TERMS TO ENTER INTO YOUR </p><p>COMPANY.\'  THEN AGAIN, DOES HE EXPECT A RESPONSE, OR </p><p>WOULD HE IMMEDIATELY POINT TO GENERAL FRANKS AND HIS </p><p>BIG STICK?  THIS IS NOT ROME OF CAESAR, IT IS NOT THE </p><p>CRUSADERS\' EMPIRE, IT IS NOT THE HORDES OF MONGOLS, NOR </p><p>IS IT THE SYKES-PICOT ACCORD AND THE BALFOUR </p><p>DECLARATION.  IT IS ALL OF THEM TOGETHER." </p><p> </p><p>-- POWELL\'S PROJECT IS DOOMED TO FAILURE, AND THE PROOF </p><p>IS JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>COLUMNIST FAHED AL-KHITAN WROTE IN INDEPENDENT, MASS- </p><p>APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM ON DECEMBER 16: </p><p>"AMERICA WILL SPEND MUCH MONEY WITHOUT RETURNS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE ROAD TO GAINING THE HEARTS OF THE ARAB </p><p>PUBLIC WOULD COST IT NOT A PENNY.  IT ONLY NEEDS TO </p><p>CHANGE ITS POLICY IN THE REGION AND THEN IT WOULD SEE </p><p>NOT ONLY AN IMPROVEMENT IN SENTIMENTS TOWARDS IT, BUT </p><p>THE PROGRESS OF DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THE REGIMES WOULD </p><p>THEN LOSE THE PRETEXTS OF SECURITY AND CONFRONTING </p><p>ISRAEL."
