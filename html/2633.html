(SBU) SUMMARY.  CHINESE HEAD OF STATE AND PARTY JIANG </p><p>ZEMIN VISITED VIETNAM FEBRUARY 27 TO MARCH 1 IN HIS FIRST </p><p>FOREIGN TRIP OF THE YEAR AND HIS FIRST TO VIETNAM SINCE </p><p>1994.  WHILE THERE WAS NO FORMAL JOINT COMMUNIQU FROM THE </p><p>VISIT, A GVN COMMUNIQU CONDEMNED TERRORISM WHILE ODDLY </p><p>OMITTING A REFERENCE TO "ONE CHINA."  THE VISIT APPARENTLY </p><p>BROKE NO NEW GROUND BUT REAFFIRMED EARLIER AGREEMENTS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE LAND BORDER TREATY, TONKIN GULF AGREEMENT, AND </p><p>D </p><p>THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES COOPERATION.  THERE ARE STILL </p><p>"SIGNIFICANT ISSUES" CONCERNING THE GULF OF TONKIN AND </p><p>FISHERIES AGREEMENTS.  WORKING-LEVEL INTER-MINISTERIAL </p><p>MEETINGS TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES "WILL CONTINUE."  THE MFA </p><p>DISMISSED REPORTS OF DISSENT OVER THE LAND BORDER AS </p><p>"OVERBLOWN."    END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>FRIENDLY TALKS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS AND PRC EMBASSY FIRST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00614  01 OF 04  151753Z </p><p>SECRETARY XI HUI, THE TRIP WAS A "GREAT SUCCESS."  MFA CHINA </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DESK DIRECTOR TRAN DUY HAI SEPARATELY TOLD POLOFF THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT JIANG HAD "FRIENDLY MEETINGS" WITH "ALL THE TOP </p><p>LEADERSHIP," INCLUDING CPV GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH, </p><p>PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG, PRIME MINISTER PHAM VAN KHAI, AND </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY NGUYEN VAN AN.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, HE ALSO MET WITH FORMER GENERAL SECRETARIES OF THE </p><p>CPV CENTRAL COMMITTEE DO MUOI AND LE KHA PHIEU.  HAI SAID </p><p>THE MEETINGS WITH THE FORMER GENERAL SECRETARIES WERE </p><p>ESSENTIALLY "COURTESY CALLS," SINCE JIANG HAD WORKED WITH </p><p>THEM CLOSELY DURING THEIR TENURES AND WANTED TO "PAY HIS </p><p>RESPECTS."  PRC EMBOFF XI SAID THAT THE VISIT HAD </p><p>"REAFFIRMED THE STRONG BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP."  ACCORDING </p><p>TO XI, JIANG FOUND RELATIONS "MUCH BETTER" THAN ON HIS </p><p>PREVIOUS VISIT IN 1994.  DEPUTY MILITARY ATTACHE LIEUTENANT </p><p>COLONEL ZHEN ZHONG XING OF THE PRC EMBASSY, WHO ACCOMPANIED </p><p>JIANG DURING MOST OF THE VISIT, CLAIMED THAT JIANG HAD BEEN </p><p>"GRATIFIED" BY WARM RECEPTION OF THE GVN\'S LEADERS AND THE </p><p>PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>NO JOINT COMMUNIQUE AND NO MENTION OF ONE CHINA POLICY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  IN CONTRAST TO THE JOINT DECLARATION THE TWO </p><p>SIDES ISSUED AFTER GENERAL SECRETARY MANH\'S NOVEMBER 2001 </p><p>VISIT TO THE PRC, THIS TIME THERE WAS ONLY A SINGLE </p><p>COMMUNIQU ISSUED BY VIETNAM\'S MFA.  ACCORDING TO PRC EMBOFF </p><p>XI, THE LEADERS HAD AGREED THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ANOTHER </p><p>JOINT DECLARATION SO SOON AFTER THE MANH VISIT.  THE </p><p>INSTITUTE OF CHINA STUDIES\' DR. NGUYEN HUY QUY SUGGESTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00614  01 OF 04  151753Z </p><p>THAT, SINCE VIETNAM HOSTED THE VISIT, IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR </p><p>THE HOST MFA TO ISSUE THE COMMUNIQU. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE MFA COMMUNIQU FAILED TO REAFFIRM VIETNAM\'S </p><p>ONE CHINA POLICY, NOR WAS VIETNAM\'S POSITION ON ONE CHINA </p><p>DESCRIBED IN MEDIA ACCOUNTS OF THE VISIT.  ROBERT HSIEH BOR- </p><p>HUEI OF THE TAIPEI ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL OFFICE (TECO) SAID </p><p>THAT FROM TAIWAN\'S PERSPECTIVE, THIS WAS "POSITIVE."  PRC </p><p>EMBOFF XI SAID THAT CHINA "KNOWS" THE GVN SUPPORTS THE ONE </p><p>CHINA POLICY AND IS SATISFIED WITH VIETNAM\'S "NORMAL </p><p>ECONOMIC RELATIONS" WITH TAIWAN.  DR. QUY STATED THAT THE </p><p>ONE CHINA POLICY HAS BEEN REAFFIRMED "MANY TIMES" IN THE </p><p>PAST.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT VIETNAM HAD NOT WISHED TO HAVE THE </p><p>ONE CHINA POLICY CITED IN THE JOINT COMMUNIQU FOLLOWING </p><p>NONG DUC MANH\'S VISIT BUT THAT THE PRC "STRONGLY REQUESTED" </p><p>THAT IT BE INCLUDED.  SINCE THE CHINESE DID NOT REQUEST IT </p><p>THIS TIME, VIETNAM WAS ABLE TO OMIT IT.  THIS ALLOWED </p><p>ED </p><p>VIETNAM TO "BE NICE" TO TAIWAN WITHOUT CONFRONTING THE PRC, </p><p>HE CLAIMED.  THE MFA\'S HAI SEPARATELY AFFIRMED THAT THE </p><p>ISSUE OF TAIWAN DID NOT EVEN COME UP DURING THE VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>TERRORISM CONDEMNED </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTO0094 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00614  02 OF 04  151753Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AIT-03   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  C-00     USNW-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  ECA-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /016W </p><p>                  ------------------7572B9  151754Z /38 </p><p>R 151726Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5835 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMCONSUL GUANGZHOU </p><p>AMCONSUL SHANGHAI </p><p>AMCONSUL SHENYANG </p><p>AMCONSUL CHENGDU </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0684 </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ABLAGG// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 HANOI 000614 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00614  02 OF 04  151753Z </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/CM </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  THE GVN\'S COMMUNIQU CONDEMNED "ALL FORMS OF </p><p>TERRORISM" AND PLEDGED TO COOPERATE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY IN ANTITERRORISM ACTIVITIES "ON THE BASIS OF THE </p><p>UN CHARTER AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAW."  ACCORDING TO THE MFA\'S HAI, BOTH SIDES ALSO PLEDGED </p><p>TO CONTRIBUTE TO INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO AID THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  THE INSTITUTE OF CHINA STUDIES\' DR. QUY TOLD </p><p>POLOFF THAT THESE STATEMENTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS </p><p>DECLARATIONS CONDEMNING TERRORISM, ESPECIALLY THE EMPHASIS </p><p>ON THE NEED TO "WORK WITHIN AN INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK." </p><p>DR. QUY ADDED THAT VIETNAM HAD CONSISTENTLY SHOWN CONCERN </p><p>FOR THE FATE OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT SITUATIONS. </p><p>THIS IS PROBABLY A "LEGACY OF THE AMERICAN WAR," HE OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>REASONS FOR THE VISIT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  DR. QUY SAID THE LEADERS DID NOT BREAK NEW GROUND </p><p>ON THIS VISIT; RATHER THEY FOCUSED ON "REAFFIRMING" PREVIOUS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00614  02 OF 04  151753Z </p><p>AGREEMENTS AND DECLARATIONS.  HE SUGGESTED SEVERAL REASONS </p><p>FOR THE VISIT AT THIS TIME: </p><p>--  TO RECIPROCATE NONG DUC MANH\'S NOVEMBER VISIT AND </p><p>CONTINUE THE SERIES OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS; </p><p>--  TO CONTINUE THE FOCUS ON INCREASING BILATERAL ECONOMIC </p><p>ACTIVITY.  THE MFA\'S HAI POINTED OUT THAT TRADE IN 2001 </p><p>REACHED CLOSE TO USD 2.8 BILLION AND THE GOAL IS TO REACH </p><p>USD 3.5 BILLION THIS YEAR AND USD 5 BILLION BY 2005; AND, </p><p>--TO "REAFFIRM" BOTH COUNTRIES\' DETERMINATION TO "CONTINUE </p><p>TO RESOLVE REMAINING ISSUES" ON PREVIOUSLY-SIGNED </p><p>AGREEMENTS, SUCH AS THE LAND BORDER TREATY, TONKIN GULF </p><p>AGREEMENT, AND THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  SINGAPORE EMBASSY\'S FIRST SECRETARY DARRYL LAU </p><p>KAI MUN TOLD POLOFF THERE ARE STILL "SIGNIFICANT ISSUES" </p><p>CONCERNING THE GULF OF TONKIN AND FISHERIES AGREEMENTS. </p><p>THESE CENTER AROUND MARITIME DEMARCATION AND THE NUMBER AND </p><p>SIZE OF FISHING VESSELS ALLOWED IN THE COMMON GROUND. </p><p>COLONEL TRAN NHUNG, DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT </p><p>FOR "PEOPLES\' ARMY" NEWSPAPER, SAID THAT THE "LARGE NUMBER" </p><p>OF FISHING VESSELS CHINA WANTS TO HAVE IN THE "OVERLAPPING" </p><p>AREAS IS "UNACCEPTABLE" TO VIETNAM.  PRC EMBOFF XI SAID </p><p>WORKING-LEVEL INTER-MINISTERIAL MEETINGS TO RESOLVE THESE </p><p>ISSUES "WILL CONTINUE." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  PRC EMBOFF XI SAID THAT THAT THE TWO SIDES HAD </p><p>SIGNED TWO DOCUMENTS DURING THE VISIT.  ONE WAS A NON- </p><p>REPAYABLE LOAN OF ABOUT USD 6.2 MILLION.  THE OTHER WAS A </p><p>FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE A PREFERENTIAL LOAN FOR TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR THE SAME AMOUNT.  ONE SPECIFIC USE OF THE </p><p>LOANS IS TO SUPPORT BILATERAL YOUTH EXCHANGES.  PRC EMBOFF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00614  02 OF 04  151753Z </p><p>XI WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE SPECIFICS REGARDING THE TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE ASPECT.  DR. QUY SAID THESE LOANS WOULD BE </p><p>VALUABLE FOR VIETNAM AND THAT INCREASING ECONOMIC </p><p>COOPERATION WILL "INEVITABLY" LEAD TO FURTHER POLITICAL </p><p>COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  BOTH DR. QUY AND XI HUI POINTED TO THE VISIT\'S </p><p>FOCUS TOWARDS YOUTH.  ASIDE FROM THE YOUTH EXCHANGE SUPPORT, </p><p>DURING THE VISIT JIANG ALSO ADDRESSED STUDENTS AT THE HANOI </p><p>NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, WHERE HE URGED YOUNG PEOPLE TO "TAKE </p><p>OVER THE BATON" OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND </p><p>"FURTHER THE CAUSE OF PEACE" IN ASIA AND THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>VISIT NOT A SURPRISE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  JIANG\'S VISIT APPEARED WELL PLANNED AND INCLUDED </p><p>A LARGE ENTOURAGE, ACCORDING TO DR. QUY.  PRC EMBOFF XI TOLD </p><p>POLOFF LAST DECEMBER THAT JIANG WAS EXPECTED TO VISIT DURING </p><p>2002.  DR. QUY VIEWED THE VISIT AS PART OF THE PATTERN OF </p><p>REGULAR, SENIOR-LEVEL BILATERAL VISITS.  DR. QUY SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT SINCE JIANG WILL SOON BE RETIRING, THIS VISIT COULD </p><p>ALSO HAVE BEEN A "FAREWELL" TO THE PRESENT VIETNAMESE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8445 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00614  03 OF 04  151753Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AIT-03   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  C-00     DINT-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /016W </p><p>                  ------------------7572C7  151753Z /38 </p><p>R 151726Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5836 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMCONSUL GUANGZHOU </p><p>AMCONSUL SHANGHAI </p><p>AMCONSUL SHENYANG </p><p>AMCONSUL CHENGDU </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0685 </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ABLAGG// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 HANOI 000614 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00614  03 OF 04  151753Z </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/CM </p><p> </p><p>LEADERS, SOME OF WHOM WILL CHANGE FOLLOWING THE MAY NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>DISSENT OVER LAND BORDER "OVERBLOWN" </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  THE MFA\'S HAI SAID BOTH SIDES REAFFIRMED THE </p><p>COMMITMENT TO FINISH MARKING THE LAND BORDER "ON TIME." </p><p>WHEN ASKED ABOUT REPORTS THAT THERE ARE SOME GROUPS WHO </p><p>ACCUSE THE GVN OF GIVING AWAY TOO MUCH TO CHINA IN THE LAND </p><p>BORDER TREATY, HAI SAID THAT "OUTSIDE GROUPS" ARE THE SOURCE </p><p>FOR THESE REPORTS, WHICH ARE "OVERBLOWN."  IN DR. QUY\'S </p><p>VIEW, DISSENT COULD BE DUE TO "LOCAL SENSITIVITIES," SINCE </p><p>SOME PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES ON THE "WRONG SIDE" OF THE </p><p>BORDER.  DR. QUY SAID THAT WHILE THE LAND BORDER ISSUE "IS </p><p>SETTLED," IT IS NECESSARY TO "STABILIZE" THE POPULATION BY </p><p>PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE LAND FOR DISPLACED FAMILIES.  HE SAID </p><p>IT WAS ALSO IMPORTANT TO (1) FINISH THE BORDER DEMARCATION </p><p>"AS SOON AS POSSIBLE" AND (2) EDUCATE PEOPLE "BETTER TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND" THE BORDER ARRANGEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00614  03 OF 04  151753Z </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>CAM RANH BAY/SOUTH CHINA SEA </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  SOURCES HERE WERE UNABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE </p><p>LEADERS HAD DISCUSSED THE FUTURE OF CAM RANH BAY (AS NOTED </p><p>IN EMBASSY BEIJING\'S EXCELLENT WRAP-UP OF THE VISIT - </p><p>REFTEL); THE ISSUE WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE GVN COMMUNIQU </p><p>OR PRESS ACCOUNTS.  HOWEVER, TECO\'S HSIEH SAID THAT IT </p><p>SEEMED UNLIKELY THAT THERE HAD BEEN ANY MEANINGFUL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT.  GIVEN CAM RANH BAY\'S PROXIMITY </p><p>TO THE DISPUTED SPRATLY ISLAND CHAIN, VIETNAM "WILL NEVER" </p><p>GRANT CHINA ACCESS TO THE BASE, HE PREDICTED.  THE TWO SIDES </p><p>DID REITERATE THEIR DESIRE FOR "PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS" TO </p><p>SETTLE OUTSTANDING SOUTH CHINA SEA ISSUES.  WHILE PRC EMBOFF </p><p>XI SAID THE TWO SIDES "MADE SOME PROGRESS" ON THIS ISSUE, </p><p>SHE WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE SPECIFICS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PARTY DISCUSSION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  COLONEL NHUNG OF THE "PEOPLES ARMY" SAID THAT </p><p>JIANG HAD ALSO BRIEFED GVN LEADERS ABOUT THE UPCOMING 16TH </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS AND DISCUSSED SOME POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS OF </p><p>PARTY PHILOSOPHY, SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE NEED TO </p><p>"CONSIDER THE BASIC INTERESTS OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE" AND TO </p><p>EMPHASIZE THAT THE PARTY SHOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT IT </p><p>REPRESENTS "CHINESE CULTURE."  ACCORDING TO COLONEL NHUNG, </p><p>THIS REPRESENTS SOME IDEOLOGICAL CHANGE FROM THE PARTY\'S </p><p>PRIMARY FOCUS ON THE STRUGGLE OF THE WORKERS.  COLONEL NHUNG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00614  03 OF 04  151753Z </p><p>OPINED THAT IT IS HIS SENSE THE CCP IS GRADUALLY CHANGING </p><p>ITS IDEOLOGICAL FOCUS AND JIANG WANTED TO CONVEY THIS </p><p>MESSAGE TO HIS COUNTERPARTS IN VIETNAM.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN THE CPV HAD "NOTICED" THIS, BECAUSE THEY PAY </p><p>"VERY CLOSE ATTENTION" TO WHATEVER GOES ON IN CHINA. </p><p>COLONEL NHUNG SAID THAT THE CPV LEADERSHIP HAD FORMED "FOCUS </p><p>GROUPS" TO STUDY THESE CHANGES AND TO JUDGE WHAT EXTENT THEY </p><p>COULD APPLY TO VIETNAM.  THE LEADERSHIP IN VIETNAM WILL TAKE </p><p>A "CAUTIOUS APPROACH," HE PREDICTED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  THE JIANG VISIT APPEARS TO HAVE SERVED ITS BASIC </p><p>PURPOSE OF REAFFIRMING THE INCREASINGLY STRONG BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, ALTHOUGH WE AGREE WITH EMBASSY BEIJING THAT </p><p>THE VISIT WAS MORE ABOUT FORM THAN SUBSTANCE.
