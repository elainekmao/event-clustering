<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001605 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  G8; MIDDLE EAST; IRAQ; U.S. ECONOMIC POLICY </p><p> </p><p>G8 </p><p>1.   "We\'d be better off with the G-Zero." </p><p>Columnist William Watson noted in the conservative </p><p>English-language daily the Montreal Gazette (6/3): "The </p><p>big news story in France yesterday was the </p><p>length of the handshake on Sunday when Jacques Chirac </p><p>welcomed George W. Bush to the G8 summit. The French </p><p>press considered it too short, even if it was followed </p><p>a little later by a friendly pat on the back from Mr. </p><p>Bush - a pat on the back with no concealed weapon, </p><p>unlike the backstabbing the Americans feel  Mr. Chirac </p><p>gave them over Iraq.... Whether in handshakes or </p><p>meetings, Bush\'s preference is clearly for brevity. </p><p>Thus he left the G8 sessions yesterday afternoon, just </p><p>halfway through the agenda. This was widely regarded as </p><p>a snub to Chirac, which it probably was, but it\'s also </p><p>consistent with Bush\'s well-known impatience with </p><p>talkfests. Loquacious Bill Clinton would have loved 48 </p><p>hours of meetings. Taciturn George W. Bush evidently </p><p>did not.... With the U.S. skipping half the meeting, </p><p>this year the G8 was the G7.5. It\'s a step in the right </p><p>direction. If more members could be persuaded to do the </p><p>same, we might eventually get down to the G-0. It\'s </p><p>hard to believe the world would be worse." </p><p> </p><p>MIDDLE EAST </p><p>2.   "Bush puts his prestige on the line" </p><p>Editorial writer David Warren commented in the </p><p>conservative National Post and the nationalist Ottawa </p><p>Citizen (6/4): "...Those who do not grasp by now </p><p>that the President means what he says may be fairly </p><p>dismissed as impenetrable. Such commentators exist on </p><p>both left and right, and indeed both ends of the </p><p>political spectrum seem now to be convinced that Mr. </p><p>Bush is, with Ariel Sharon in carriage, purposely </p><p>advancing a `road map\' so little different from the old </p><p>failed Oslo process that he must be expecting </p><p>it to fail, leaving Israel free, when it does, to </p><p>settle matters by force. This is, however, a complete </p><p>misreading of Mr. Bush. He may be foolish, but </p><p>he is not cynical. He has put his money where his mouth </p><p>was a sufficient number of consecutive times, and been </p><p>sufficiently transparent about his intentions, to be </p><p>relieved of the latter charge.... Notwithstanding, Mr. </p><p>Bush is putting the credibility of the United States, </p><p>and his own prestige, on the line. He is banking on the </p><p>new leverage the United States has as a regional power </p><p>in its own right - it has occupied Iraq - and on the </p><p>cumulative effect of the trauma in the Arab world of </p><p>watching Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s statue come down, and absorbing that </p><p>occupation.... Israel most certainly risks getting </p><p>burned, for the peace Mr. Bush seeks is regional not </p><p>local.... This is a Herculean task: cleaning the Augean </p><p>stables, changing the very nature of Arab politics. Mr. </p><p>Bush believes it cannot be avoided, </p><p>and he is right in the middle of it now." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "New credo" </p><p>Jean-Marc Salvet, chief editorialist at the centrist Le </p><p>Soleil, wrote (6/4): "Many pundits were wrong in </p><p>believing George W. Bush would shy away from the </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict.... The world\'s first </p><p>power has accepted the idea that a firm commitment on </p><p>its part would increase the chances of reaching a </p><p>political settlement in the Mid-East.... Nothing better </p><p>illustrates the new American determination than the </p><p>Aqaba summit where the Israeli and Palestinian prime </p><p>ministers will meet President Bush.... The agreements </p><p>in principle obtained so far are important but fragile. </p><p>That is why Washington must see to it that the Road Map </p><p>is applied and that its interlocutors do not deviate </p><p>from it." </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>4.   "A just war regardless" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "Whether WMDs are found or not, </p><p>the allies need offer no apologies for liberating </p><p>Iraq," the conservative National Post opined </p><p>(6/4): "...As Mr. Bush himself has plainly admitted, </p><p>the war was always about more than WMDs. It was about </p><p>creating a new political environment in the Middle </p><p>East, destroying the cult of militant Arabism that kept </p><p>the Palestinian-Israeli conflict simmering, </p><p>extinguishing a possible nexus between rogue power and </p><p>terrorism; and, perhaps, in the long term, </p><p>democratizing the Arab world. Given that these are </p><p>large, ambitious projects, the U.S. and British leaders </p><p>would have had a difficult time using them as an </p><p>explicit basis to justify war. Thus the two  government </p><p>focused, perhaps overly so, on the threat of WMDs and </p><p>links to al-Qaeda - which are simpler, more tangible </p><p>themes. But over time, as the larger benefits of Iraq\'s </p><p>liberation unfold, we are confident the paucity of WMDs </p><p>found in the country will come to be regarded in the </p><p>West as an insignificant footnote to the region\'s </p><p>history - much as it already is to the many ordinary </p><p>Iraqis freed of Saddam\'s tyranny." </p><p> </p><p>U.S. ECONOMIC POLICY </p><p>5.   "U.S. manufacturing could rescue Canada." </p><p>Columnist Jay Bryan observed in the nationalist Ottawa </p><p>Citizen (6/3): "It\'s an obscure number, and much of the </p><p>time justifiably so, but when the U.S. is faltering in </p><p>its job as global economic locomotive, the Institute </p><p>for Supply Management\'s measure of manufacturing </p><p>health, best known as the ISM index, </p><p>can become a critically important indicator of where </p><p>the economy is going.... As the Canadian economy </p><p>staggers under the weight of Toronto\'s SARS episode, </p><p>Alberta\'s mad cow scare and a darkening domestic </p><p>economic landscape, the importance of exports to the </p><p>U.S. has become critical.... That\'s why the apparent </p><p>revival in U.S. manufacturing couldn\'t be more </p><p>welcome. Since Canada\'s rising interest rates and </p><p>dollar are acting to squeeze our still-robust growth </p><p>rate, a reviving U.S. economy is our best hope for a </p><p>healthy economy this time next year." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
