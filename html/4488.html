<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002689 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, OI/UN, AND DS </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ODIP, EAID, ASEC, ZI, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: FURTHER DEVELOPMENT ON DETENTION OF US/UN STAFF IN </p><p>MELFORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 2529 B) HARARE 2628 C) 2624 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY DCM REWHITEHEAD DUE TO 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c) Summary.  The November 15 detention of a U.S. </p><p>diplomat, a UN officer, and two Zimbabwean nationals (ref a) </p><p>continues to reverberate.  Following Ambassador\'s meeting </p><p>with the MFA (ref b), GOZ official also met with UNDP Deputy </p><p>Resident Representative after the latter submitted a note of </p><p>protest parallel to the one submitted by us.  The meeting, </p><p>during which the UN threatened to scale back activities if </p><p>security issues cannot be resolved, received equally slanted </p><p>coverage in the GOZ press.  The GOZ appears unwilling to take </p><p>the necessary punitive action against the "war veterans" </p><p>responsible for the detention and had instead embarked on a </p><p>strategy of obfuscation and disinformaton that has further </p><p>damaged its credibility and strained its relations with the </p><p>diplomatic corps.  The EU and some African colleagues have </p><p>expressed displeasure with the GOZ\'s instruction that </p><p>henceforth diplomats must notify the MFA before traveling </p><p>outside of greater Harare.  We see this as something of a </p><p>side-show and remain convinced that forcing the GOZ to face </p><p>up to its responsibilities is far more important, especially </p><p>should this occur in broader United Nations Security Council </p><p>(UNSC) discussions of the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>UN Faces Off Against the GOZ </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c) On November 21, in the wake of a meeting between the </p><p>U.S. and GOZ diplomats, MFA Europe and Americas Director Joey </p><p>Bihma also met with UNDP Deputy Resrep Bernard Mokam at </p><p>Bihma\'s request.  According to Mokam, the encounter was </p><p>considerably tougher than our session.  Bihma complained </p><p>about the tone of the diplomatic note of protest that the </p><p>UNDP submitted following the Melfort incident and blamed the </p><p>visiting diplomats for provoking the incident.  Mokam in turn </p><p>warned that if the security issue is not resolved, the UN </p><p>would have no choice but to heighten its security posture, </p><p>limit travel of staff to the field, and as a result reduce or </p><p>curtail some programs.  He also warned that GOZ inaction on </p><p>assuring the security of diplomats would have an adverse </p><p>impact on overall donor support for Zimbabwe.  Following the </p><p>encounter, Mokam expressed particular displeasure with GOZ </p><p>press coverage of the meeting, specifically the Herald\'s </p><p>allegation that Mokam had admitted that the UN had failed to </p><p>inform the GOZ, as required by (non-existent) MFA circular </p><p>note D61, prior to the visit in Melfort.  The UN sent a </p><p>follow-up diplomatic note objecting to the statements </p><p>attributed to GOZ officials in the Herald report and </p><p>providing a detailed summary of the meeting, for the record. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Covering Their Tracks, Poorly </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c) The GOZ approach to the Melfort incident is clearly </p><p>one of misdirection.  Instead of disavowing the actions of </p><p>the war vets involved, and taking punitive action against </p><p>them, the GOZ has attempted to shift the blame.  In doing so, </p><p>GOZ officials have resorted not so much to disinformation as </p><p>outright lies, and increasingly damaged what little </p><p>credibility they have left.  On November 22, most members of </p><p>the diplomatic community received MFA circular (secular, </p><p>according to the GOZ press) note D61.  The note claims to be </p><p>a reminder of an earlier note that required all diplomats to </p><p>notify (as opposed to request permission) 48-hours before </p><p>traveling more than 40 kilometers beyond greater Harare. </p><p>This "reminder" presumably refers to the June 22 circular </p><p>(secular) note cited in GOZ press coverage of our meeting, a </p><p>note that in fact was never sent.  No one in the diplomatic </p><p>corps received such a note in June (although the British </p><p>received a similar note in September).  The note, which was </p><p>clearly rushed out the door to support the alleged existence </p><p>the earlier non-existent note, is sloppily written.  If does </p><p>not clarify exactly who must notify, nor whether this refers </p><p>to official travel.  Attempts by various diplomats to clarify </p><p>these points with the MFA have engendered contradictory </p><p>responses. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c) Not surprisingly, the GOZ\'s clumsy approach has </p><p>provoked a mixture of smiles and frowns from the donor </p><p>community.  A number of our colleagues have pointed out that </p><p>Melfort lies within 40-kilometers of greater Harare, thus </p><p>having obviated the then non-existent need to inform before </p><p>visiting.  Charges of the U.S./UN group throwing food out the </p><p>window of their car and filming the ensuing food fight has </p><p>also inspired considerable mirth.  The EU and other </p><p>diplomats, however, have expressed disbelief and ire at the </p><p>GOZ\'s latest blundering.  There is a move afoot to send the </p><p>acting dean of the diplomatic corps, the Zambian High </p><p>Commissioner, to protest the notification requirement and </p><p>request clarification on exactly what it means.  Later today, </p><p>the far more serious issue of failing to take the necessary </p><p>steps to protect diplomats risks becoming the central point </p><p>of discussion in a meeting at UNDP between the donors and the </p><p>GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>COMMENT: Next Steps </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c) While we think reciprocal restrictions on Zimbabwean </p><p>diplomats in Washington and New York might be in order at the </p><p>appropriate moment, we think it important first to define </p><p>clearly just who is being restricted and how, particularly </p><p>since U.S. diplomats have far more at stake than Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>tiny diplomatic staff, and more importantly, to keep the </p><p>focus on GOZ responsibility to ensure protection and </p><p>diplomatic privileges rather than let the GOZ change the </p><p>subject to a dispute over travel restrictions.  Several of </p><p>our diplomatic colleagues are also anxious to give our </p><p>African colleagues an opportunity to convince the GOZ to </p><p>abandon its position.  We also note that the notification </p><p>requirement does not constitute GOZ permission to travel, </p><p>which we would strongly protest, and is little more than a </p><p>paperwork exercise.  The GOZ failure to protect diplomats </p><p>involved in humanitarian actions is an altogether different </p><p>and more serious matter.  We continue to believe that the </p><p>best approach to the Melfort incident, and similar problems, </p><p>would be to package this within a UNSC special session on the </p><p>humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe.  In that context, the GOZ </p><p>would find is very difficult to hide its failure to respect </p><p>its responsibilities behind the usual veil of obfuscation and </p><p>untruth </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
