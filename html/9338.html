<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001777 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DS/ICI/PII, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/EUR, DS/ICI/CI, </p><p>DS/IP/FPO,DS/DSS/OSAC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, NL </p><p>SUBJECT:  TELEPHONIC BOMB THREAT FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS IN </p><p>ROTTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS ON 07/11/03 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) SUMMARY. On July 11, 2003, at approximately 1300 </p><p>hours an embassy telephone operator at the U.S. Embassy The </p><p>Hague received a telephonic bomb threat from a male </p><p>individual stating he was a member of the activist group </p><p>called RA-RA and stated that maybe we will blow up the </p><p>American Express in Rotterdam, today or tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) The conversation went as follows: </p><p> </p><p>    Caller: Stated asked if the operator spoke Dutch, when </p><p>    he replied in the affirmative the caller said quote </p><p>    don\'t take this personally, this is agency (group) Ra- </p><p>    RA (at this point the operator began recording)- I am </p><p>    against discrimination and economic warfare, you must </p><p>    take this seriously - we thought about bombing the </p><p>    American Express in Rotterdam today or tomorrow, </p><p>    unquote. The caller immediately hung up. </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) The RSO notified The Hague Police who in turn </p><p>notified the Rotterdam Police. Rotterdam Police were to </p><p>notify American Express. Unlike the 07/09 call which </p><p>announced a detonation in 30 minutes and due to the </p><p>indefinite nature of the threat, quote we thought about </p><p>bombing unquote, and the very similar hoax call of 07/09 we </p><p>did not directly notify the Security Chief at American </p><p>Express in the Netherlands. The Hague Intel Unit responded </p><p>and obtained a copy of the embassy\'s recording. The Hague </p><p>Police promised to advise of developments in their </p><p>investigation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Our Sr. FSNI described the caller as a native Dutch </p><p>speaker who is well spoken and well educated, without an </p><p>identifiable regional accent. Our FSNI opined that there was </p><p>a high crank quotient to this call and doubts the callers </p><p>alleged connection to RA-RA. Our former long time telephone </p><p>operator, now in HR, thought the caller was one of our </p><p>regular crank/disgruntled callers after reviewing the </p><p>recording. </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) RA-RA, the Revolutionary Anti-Racism Alliance, is an </p><p>ultra leftist group first organized to protest South African </p><p>apartheid and racist sentiment in the Netherlands.  This </p><p>group was violently opposed to restrictions on granting </p><p>refugee status. Although the organization has been inactive </p><p>for approximately three years in the Netherlands, they have </p><p>used arson and bombs in the past.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>BAILY </p><p></p></div>
