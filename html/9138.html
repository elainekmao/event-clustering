<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State for IIP/F/AF Esquetini; AF/PD Amirthanayagam </p><p>Lagos for PAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, SCUL, OEXC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: "If only Ms. Foster had come before the </p><p>elections" - Nigerian Women lamented after Speaking </p><p>tour of Stephenie Foster, President of Georgetown </p><p>Strategies. </p><p> </p><p>Summary: Ms. Stephenie Foster, President of Georgetown </p><p>Strategies, was on a speaking tour of Nigeria between </p><p>May 8 and 17, 2003. During this tour, Ms. Foster </p><p>addressed different women\'s groups including NGO </p><p>leaders, academics, lawyers, journalists, and party </p><p>activists on lobbying, advocacy, message development, </p><p>and coalition building in Kaduna, Kano, Lagos, Enugu </p><p>and Port Harcourt. Additionally, a "Women In </p><p>Governance" conference organized by the National </p><p>Center for Women Development in Abuja presented a </p><p>target-of  portunity for Ms. Foster to address about </p><p>150 women from all over Nigeria on strategies and </p><p>programs to empower women to participate effectively </p><p>in the political process. End summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Date: May 7 - 17, 2003 </p><p>   Fiscal Year: FY - 2003 </p><p>   Quarter: Third </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Description of activity: Ms. Foster held roundtable </p><p>discussions with women activists in Kaduna and Kano </p><p>with advocacy and campaign skills as key concerns. </p><p>Other issues raised include election irregularities, </p><p>funding and resources for women political candidates, </p><p>cultural barriers and family issues, need for </p><p>empowerment of the girl-child, civic education at an </p><p>early age, and better statistics on women. Ms. Foster </p><p>also granted interviews to the "Daily Trust" and the </p><p>"New Nigerian," the two largest newspapers in Northern </p><p>Nigeria. The sessions in Enugu and Port Harcourt were </p><p>training sessions, while Lagos and Abuja featured </p><p>breakfast and lunch with opinion leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Justification and objective: Although women were </p><p>active in civic, political, and non governmental </p><p>organizations that worked assiduously for the return </p><p>of democracy in Nigeria, very few of them offered </p><p>themselves as candidates in the 1999 and 2003 general </p><p>elections. Even the few women who contested for </p><p>elective positions did not fare well at the polls. </p><p>Since representative democracy takes cognizance of </p><p>both majority and disadvantaged groups, the issue of </p><p>women\'s participation in the political process has </p><p>been of concern to political observers in the country. </p><p>PAS Nigeria invited Ms. Foster to share her vast </p><p>experience, in both Congressional and Presidential </p><p>election campaigns, with Nigerian women who have </p><p>already begun organizing themselves to tackle problems </p><p>inhibiting women\'s participation in politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MPP umbrella themes: Strengthening democracy, </p><p>especially widening the political spectrum and </p><p>democratizing the political process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Result/impact: Excellent. "If only Ms. Foster had come </p><p>before the elections" was the lament after every event </p><p>at all program locations across the country, </p><p>indicating that women would have fared better in the </p><p>elections if they had the knowledge they gained at the </p><p>sessions with Ms. Foster. They were, however, </p><p>encouraged by the consensus that by lobbying and </p><p>advocating for women\'s issues they can keep their </p><p>political aspirations alive and simultaneously work at </p><p>the grassroots level to build support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>An immediate fallout of Ms. Foster\'s speaking </p><p>engagement was the decision by three women at the Kano </p><p>session to seek elective positions in the 2007 general </p><p>elections. It is expected that more women will take up </p><p>the challenge. Furthermore, the program brought </p><p>together, for the first time, after the elections, the </p><p>leadership of the women\'s wing of the ruling Peoples\' </p><p>Democratic Party (PDP) and the opposition All Nigeria </p><p>Peoples\' Party (ANPP) Ms. Foster received wide </p><p>coverage in both print and the electronic media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Non-USG sources of support: An umbrella organization </p><p>of women activists in Kano provided venue and snacks </p><p>at the one-day session for about twenty participants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Quality of agency support: Post salutes IIP/F/AF for </p><p>selecting such an effective speaker and for recruiting </p><p>her on such short notice Jeter </p><p></p></div>
