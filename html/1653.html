IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) BOTSWANA\'S PRESIDENT, FESTUS MOGAE, ARRIVED IN </p><p>HARARE ON APRIL 25 FOR A FOUR-DAY STATE VISIT, THE </p><p>STATED PURPOSE OF WHICH IS FOR THE BOTSWANA CHIEF </p><p>EXECUTIVE TO OPEN THE ZIMBABWE INTERNATIONAL TRADE FAIR </p><p>IN BULAWAYO.  THIS IS MOGAE\'S SECOND WORKING VISIT IN 8 </p><p>MONTHS; HE WAS LAST HERE IN AUGUST TO OPEN AN </p><p>AGRICULTURAL EXHIBIT IN HARARE.  THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS CONVOKED HEADS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS TO MEET </p><p>THE PRESIDENT AT THE AIRPORT, A RARE HONOR GRANTED TO </p><p>VISITING HEADS OF STATE IN ZIMBABWE.  THE AIRPORT </p><p>CEREMONY ENTAILED A TWENTY-ONE-GUN SALUTE AND AN HONOR </p><p>GUARD REVIEW.  THE TWO PRESIDENTS MET PRIVATELY FOR </p><p>THREE HOURS IN THE AFTERNOON AND, INTER ALIA, SIGNED A </p><p>TRADE AGREEMENT DESIGNED TO EASE RESTRICTIONS ON CROSS- </p><p>BORDER MOVEMENT OF MANUFACTURING INPUTS.  INDUSTRY AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE MINISTER NKOSANA MOYO INFORMED US </p><p>THAT HE ORGANIZED THE VISIT AT THE LAST MOMENT AND WAS </p><p>SURPRISED THAT IT ACTUALLY HAD COME TOGETHER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) IN THE EVENING, PRESIDENT MUGABE HOSTED A SET- </p><p>PIECE STATE DINNER FOR HIS BOTSWANA COUNTERPART.  THE </p><p>GUEST LIST CONSISTED MOSTLY OF DIPLOMATIC HEADS OF </p><p>MISSION, SELECTED MINISTERS, AND ZANU-PF LUMINARIES, </p><p>HALF OF WHOM DID NOT SHOW JUDGING FROM THE MASS OF EMPTY </p><p>TABLES.  THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT DELIVERED A TWENTY- </p><p>MINUTE WELCOME SPEECH IN WHICH HE ADDRESSED MOGAE IN </p><p>CLOYING TERMS -- "MY DEAR BROTHER" BEING ONE OF THE LESS </p><p>SACCHARINE -- AND PLEDGED ETERNAL FRIENDSHIP.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01419  260833Z </p><p>SPEECH CONTAINED A NUMBER OF BRICKBATS FOR THE WEST, AND </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE BRITISH, FOR DISTORTING THE NATURE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  HE WAS </p><p>DISMISSIVE OF THOSE WHO CLAIMED THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE SINCE 1999 BOILED DOWN TO A PROBLEM OF BASIC </p><p>GOVERNANCE AND A THREAT TO THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE </p><p>JUDICIARY.  HE CLAIMED ZIMBABWE WAS READY TO ENGAGE </p><p>BRITAIN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AS DISPLAYED IN </p><p>ITS RESPONSE TO THE LETTER OF UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MARK </p><p>MALLOCH-BROWN.  HE THANKED BOTSWANA FOR ITS HELP IN </p><p>GETTING VITAL FUEL AND OTHER SUPPLIES TO ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>CONDEMNED THE "VIRTUAL SANCTIONS IMPOSED FROM THE WEST," </p><p>ON WHICH HE PARTIALLY BLAMED ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT BAD </p><p>ECONOMIC PATCH.  "WE ARE A DETERMINED NATION; AS GALLANT </p><p>FIGHTERS WE SHALL NEVER ALLOW OUR ECONOMY TO COLLAPSE." </p><p>MUGABE EXPRESSED CERTAINTY THAT WITH THE FORMATION OF </p><p>THE AFRICAN UNION IN JULY IN LUSAKA, THE IMF, WORLD BANK </p><p>AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION WOULD BE OBLIGED TO TAKE </p><p>THE CONTINENT SERIOUSLY.  MOGAE RESPONDED LARGELY WITH </p><p>PLEASANTRIES, CONCLUDING HIS REMARKS BY THANKING MUGABE </p><p>FOR THE "FULL BRIEFING" HE GAVE ON THE CHALLENGES </p><p>ZIMBABWE FACES AND THE MEASURES ITS GOVERNMENT IS TAKING </p><p>TO ADDRESS THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: MOGAE IS THE SECOND AFRICAN HEAD OF </p><p>STATE TO VISIT ZIMBABWE IN THE LAST MONTH: THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\'S JOSEPH KABILA WAS </p><p>HERE MARCH 25-27.  MUGABE REGALED BOTH VISITORS WITH </p><p>HOSPITALITY SO LAVISH IT BORDERED ON THE OBSCENE, GIVEN </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  IT HAS NOT GONE </p><p>UNNOTICED.  MOST HEADS OF MISSION HERE ATTRIBUTE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01419  260833Z </p><p>LATEST STAGED HOOPLA TO MUGABE\'S WISH TO COURT THE </p><p>PEACEABLE MOGAE.  BOTSWANA PROVIDES A LIFELINE FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE, SUPPLYING INPUTS THAT ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF </p><p>THIS COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY AND REMITTANCES FROM ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>LIVING AND WORKING IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY.  BOTSWANA </p><p>ALSO CHAIRS THE COMMONWEALTH MINISTERIAL ACTION GROUP </p><p>THAT CURRENTLY WISHES TO SEND A MISSION TO ZIMBABWE TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE THE REIGN OF TERROR BEING UNLEASHED AGAINST </p><p>SUSPECTED OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, THE JUDICIARY, THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT PRESS AND MOST RECENTLY, COMPANY MANAGERS IN </p><p>URBAN AREAS.  THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE (MDC) HAS COURTED THE MOGAE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ASSIDUOUSLY -- A STRATEGY THAT HAS BEGUN TO PAY </p><p>DIVIDENDS -- AND MUGABE LIKELY HOPES TO PREVENT THAT </p><p>RELATIONSHIP FROM GETTING ANY WARMER.  MUGABE SPENT </p><p>CONSIDERABLE TIME TELLING MOGAE THAT ALL WAS WELL IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, BUT HEARD NO PUBLIC STATEMENT FROM HIS GUEST </p><p>ENDORSING THE FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
