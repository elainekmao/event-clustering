<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002435 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR BURCKY </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: Italy\'s Finance Police See IPR Protection as Key </p><p> </p><p>(U) This cable is sensitive but Unclassified.  Please </p><p>Protect Accordingly.  Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: In a recent discussion with Emboffs, </p><p>Major General Nino di Paolo underscored the commitment of </p><p>Italy\'s Finance Police (FP) to fighting IPR piracy.  IPR </p><p>protection has become a top priority for the FP as it has </p><p>focused on the links between IPR pirates and organized </p><p>crime.  Di Paolo said that law enforcement has sufficient </p><p>legal tools to investigate and arrest offenders.  He saw </p><p>magistrates, however, as either unwilling (in some cases) </p><p>or too overworked (more often) to deal effectively with </p><p>IPR criminals.  The far more fundamental problem, in his </p><p>view, is the pervasive lack of understanding and support </p><p>from the Italian political elites and the public. </p><p>Changing this will require long-term, systematic </p><p>education and outreach efforts. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On May 12, Guardia di Finanza (Finance Police - </p><p>FP) Major General Nino di Paola hosted a luncheon for </p><p>ECMIN, Econcouns and Econ Specialist.  Also participating </p><p>from the FP were Brigadier General Francesco Polella, </p><p>head of international affairs, and Colonel Paolo Granata, </p><p>head of the Antifraud and International Cooperation </p><p>office.  The FP handles financial and economic crimes, </p><p>including terrorism finance, money laundering, smuggling, </p><p>tax evasion, counterfeiting and IPR piracy.  Di Paola is </p><p>the third most senior official nationally in the FP. </p><p>3. (SBU) Di Paolo stated flatly that IPR protection is a </p><p>top priority for the FP.  The FP, he stressed, sees IPR </p><p>piracy (copyright and trademark in particular) not as </p><p>simple fraud or tax evasion, but as an integral part of </p><p>organized crime.  In fact, in certain areas of the </p><p>country criminal organizations have used IPR piracy </p><p>earnings to replace lost revenues from traditional but </p><p>declining illegal activities, such as cigarette </p><p>smuggling, with copyright and trademark piracy.  Di Paolo </p><p>expressed his conviction that treating piracy as a petty </p><p>offence was a major mistake. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The laws now on the books in Italy are adequate </p><p>and provide enforcement agencies with sufficient legal </p><p>tools, in Di Paolo\'s view.  He argued that higher </p><p>criminal penalties would not prove a significant </p><p>deterrent to piracy.  He pointed out that criminals are </p><p>often involved not only in piracy but also arms </p><p>trafficking, money laundering and other crimes, and </p><p>sentences are already significant for those crimes. </p><p>Those not involved in other criminal acts, however, </p><p>tended to be lower level pirates, whom magistrates are </p><p>reluctant to sentence to jail time. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) "Piracy can only be fought effectively if the </p><p>Italian people\'s cultural approach to piracy is changed," </p><p>stressed Di Paolo.  His proposal was to initiate a </p><p>systematic, long-term information and sensitization </p><p>campaign -- starting with primary schools.  Criminal and </p><p>civil penalties, he said, are ineffective and difficult </p><p>to implement "if a crime is not perceived as a threat and </p><p>penalties are deemed inappropriate by the people." Di </p><p>Paolo said that when his men raid arms dealers, </p><p>bystanders on the scene applaud.  However, when the same </p><p>officers raid music and video pirates, bystanders object </p><p>and argue. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Di Paolo recognized that some magistrates tend </p><p>to treat piracy as minor offences.  He maintained, </p><p>however, that many judges do recognize the seriousness of </p><p>IPR crimes, yet must set them aside to handle murders and </p><p>other violent crimes.  In fact, Di Paolo explained, </p><p>piracy is so closely linked to organized crime that major </p><p>trademark and copyright piracy tends to be centered in </p><p>areas of high criminal incidence.  Naples, for example, </p><p>is the top area for criminal piracy and also a center of </p><p>organized crime violence.  Magistrates under crushing </p><p>workloads understandably give priority to murders and </p><p>other violent crimes. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Di Paolo and ECMIN agreed that the Embassy and </p><p>the FP would work to deepen and reinforce our mutual </p><p>efforts in the fight against IPR piracy.  Working with </p><p>our consulates and the IPR industry, we agreed to renew </p><p>our plan of action against piracy, in light of lessons </p><p>learned over the past few years. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Di Paolo thanked ECMIN for the Embassy\'s </p><p> </p><p>services in support of an important voluntary visitor </p><p>program for senior FP officers conducted in April and for </p><p>the continued inclusion of FP officers in the </p><p>International Visitors program.  Underscoring the </p><p>longstanding and active collaboration between the FP and </p><p>Embassy officials, Di Paolo expressed satisfaction that </p><p>the relationship had expanded from enforcement activities </p><p>to policy dialogue on issues such as money laundering and </p><p>IPR protection. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Comment: Under General Di Paolo\'s leadership, </p><p>the FP has led Italy\'s fight against IPR piracy.  We have </p><p>found them both committed and realistic in their efforts, </p><p>but largely unsupported by the public and political </p><p>elites. We hear frequently from IPR industry </p><p>representatives about excellent cooperation from the FP, </p><p>which is subsequently undermined by magistrates\' </p><p>unwillingness to prosecute and convict.  Di Paolo\'s less </p><p>critical view of the magistrates may be simply a </p><p>realistic assessment that he can expect no more. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02435 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
