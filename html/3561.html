<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001925 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT MUGABE ATTACKS WEST; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The August 23rd edition of the government- </p><p>      controlled daily "Herald" gave prominent coverage to </p><p>      the Government of Zimbabwe\'s reaction to recent US </p><p>      criticism of the Mugabe regime. Under headline </p><p>      "President raps West" the paper ran two, page-one, </p><p>      above-the-fold stories detailing GoZ rejection of US </p><p>      criticism.  Copies of the stories have been faxed to </p><p>      AF/S and AF/PD.  Excerpts follow. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "President Mugabe yesterday accused the United </p><p>      States, Britain and white members of the Commonwealth </p><p>      of conducting a racist campaign to undermine the </p><p>      Zimbabwean government.  `Today, Britain, Australia, </p><p>      New Zealand. . .what color are they?  They are white </p><p>      and are the ones leading the fight against Zimbabwe.\' </p><p>      The President said these countries were resisting the </p><p>      completion of the independence process began in 1980 </p><p>      in order to protect their kith and kin. . .  They </p><p>      don\'t want us to be economically independent.  They </p><p>      want us to be beggars. . .coming to them everyday with </p><p>      a bowl asking for help.  No. . .we have our resources </p><p>      here.  They belong to us and we are taking and giving </p><p>      them to our people. . .  The people of Zimbabwe are </p><p>      the only makers of the leadership, the only makers of </p><p>      our government.  We are not made as a government in </p><p>      Washington.  Let Mr. Bush know that. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under the sub-head "Demand Explanation from US, </p><p>      State Urged" the "Herald" also published Information </p><p>      Minister Jonathan Moyo\'s reaction to A/S Kansteiner\'s </p><p>      August 20 press briefing.  Excerpts follow. </p><p> </p><p>      "ZANU PF yesterday urged the government to </p><p>      demand an explanation from the U.S. over its </p><p>      announcement that it was working with SADC </p><p>      countries to topple President Mugabe.  In a </p><p>      statement, the party\'s deputy secretary for </p><p>      information and publicity Professor Jonathan </p><p>      Moyo said the claims by the U.S. constituted a </p><p>      clear threat to regional peace, stability, </p><p>      solidarity and good neighborliness.  `The widely- </p><p>      publicized and shockingly scandalous claims by </p><p>      the American Assistant Secretary of State (for </p><p>      African Affairs), Walter Kansteiner, that the U. </p><p>      S. is working with `South Africans, Botswanas </p><p>      (sic) and Mozambicans\' to topple President </p><p>      Mugabe have let the cat out of the bag.  Now we </p><p>      know.  As ZANU PF, we call on the government to </p><p>      demand a full explanation and get to the bottom </p><p>      of the matter given the seriousness of the </p><p>      claims and their grave implications,\' said Prof </p><p>      Moyo. </p><p> </p><p>      "He said the fact that Mr. Kansteiner had no </p><p>      qualms about making such an outrageous statement </p><p>      implicating `our very friendly neighbors </p><p>      demonstrates that either he is hopelessly </p><p>      incompetent and immature or the Bush Government </p><p>      is very contemptuous of South Africa, Mozambique </p><p>      and Botswana.  `We have the highest respect for </p><p>      the national leadership in South Africa, </p><p>      Mozambique, Botswana and we have no doubt </p><p>      whatsoever that they are not among the type of </p><p>      people who can be used for imperialist and </p><p>      racist objectives in the pursuit of an American </p><p>      foreign policy that has clearly gone mad.\'  On </p><p>      Mr. Kansteiner\'s nonsense that the Bush </p><p>      government does not see President Mugabe as </p><p>      democratically-elected," Prof. Moyo said it was </p><p>      a fact that the whole world including Americans </p><p>      knew that President George Bush was not </p><p>      democratically-elected as he was chosen by a </p><p>      partisan Republican appointed court which gave </p><p>      him victory in a controversial 5-4 decision. </p><p>      "It is therefore clear that, like his </p><p>      Bushmaster, Kansteiner lives in the bush of </p><p>      racist fantasies and delusions that have nothing </p><p>      to do with democracy or democratic elections. </p><p>      For these reasons we are outraged by the cowboy </p><p>      tactics that Bush\'s men are trying to introduce </p><p>      into our country and our region. </p><p> </p><p>      "Prof Moyo said the Bush government needed to be </p><p>      told in the strongest possible terms that just </p><p>      like Zimbabweans will never ever entertain </p><p>      America\'s puppets disguised as human rights </p><p>      activists or democrats, southern Africa would </p><p>      not tolerate the same.  `Each time America </p><p>      preaches about democracy and human rights, </p><p>      Africans are reminded of the racist brutality </p><p>      that the people of color have endured slavery </p><p>      days but particularly under the Bush Government </p><p>      following the tragic events of September 11 now </p><p>      being used as a cover to assault and dehumanize </p><p>      Africans and others." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
