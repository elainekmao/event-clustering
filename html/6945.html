<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001882 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>TREASURY FOR MILLS, CHANG </p><p>TDA FOR SIGLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ECPS, PREL, KPAO, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: VENTING ON THE WEB: JORDAN INTERNET USE </p><p>SURGES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The two major Internet providers in Jordan </p><p>report a sharp upsurge in Internet use, particularly email </p><p>traffic, over the past week.  Technical support managers said </p><p>that sophisticated software is allowing users to access and </p><p>download inflammatory TV news reports, which are then given </p><p>broad circulation via email.  Despite an increase in traffic </p><p>that has at times reached 95% of capacity, providers report </p><p>no problems providing uninterrupted service.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Hamed Ghamam, Technical Support Director for </p><p>Cyberia, Jordan\'s largest internet provider, told us March 27 </p><p>that Internet use had surged since the conflict with Iraq </p><p>began one week ago.  He said that while most users accessed </p><p>the Web to check on the news throughout the day, there has </p><p>been an unusually high increase in email traffic.  Ghamam </p><p>said that he was now receiving 50 emails per day, up from 20 </p><p>as recently as last week.  Judging by the content of emails </p><p>he has received lately from contacts around the region, </p><p>senders have become more sophisticated in their ability to </p><p>download television news programs and "rebroadcast" them to </p><p>friends and family.  He said the messages he has received </p><p>feature footage from Al Jazeera or Iraqi TV, showing </p><p>particularly incendiary clips.  Ghamam said that the tone of </p><p>the mail has been "extremely angry and growing moreso day by </p><p>day."  He added that he has also seen an increase in </p><p>individual calls for a boycott of American and British goods, </p><p>but stressed that "there is no organized character to it as </p><p>of yet." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Likewise, Adel Uzaizi, Technical Support Manager </p><p>for Batelco (the other leading ISP), said that his company </p><p>has also seen a recent increase in traffic.  He said that </p><p>many subscribers take advantage of Internet access at work to </p><p>read the news and send emails in reaction.  He broadly echoed </p><p>Ghamam\'s comments, and said that there was "lots of anger out </p><p>there and this is the only way some people can vent."  Uzaizi </p><p>said that it was relatively easy, if one had the right </p><p>software, which is easily obtainable, to pull newscasts right </p><p>of the Internet and send them around.  Uzaizi said, too, that </p><p>mobile text messaging was being utilized the same way. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Both managers said their networks can easily handle </p><p>the traffic, although Ghamam said that at peak times, from </p><p>8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. during the week, Cyberia had reached </p><p>95% of its capacity, up from 80% one week ago, with no </p><p>problems.  He said that levels of use are lowest on Friday </p><p>and rise a bit on Saturday.  Uzaizi said that Hashem One, the </p><p>main link for the Internet in Jordan, is maintained by Jordan </p><p>Telecom, and "has been pretty dependable" throughout busy </p><p>times, such as the Eid holiday and Ramadam. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) COMMENT: As long as the war goes on, and probably </p><p>after, Jordanians will use the Internet to vent their </p><p>feelings and share news and opinions.  Unless it is used to </p><p>organize and incite violence, this medium is probably </p><p>perceived by the Government of Jordan as a tolerable, and </p><p>preferable, way for people to let off steam.  We know of only </p><p>one U.S.-based, Arabic website, www.arabnews.com, that </p><p>appears to be blocked by the GOJ for political content. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
