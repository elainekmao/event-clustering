<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004110 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S OPPOSITION CHP STILL WALKING TIGHTROPE ON </p><p>SUPPORT FOR EU REFORM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 3732 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 3974 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter. </p><p>Reason: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: AK government says it will pursue as one or </p><p>two additional EU reform packages (the seventh and eighth) </p><p>before Parliament goes on delayed recess this summer. </p><p>Opposition CHP supported the sixth package in June 20 vote, </p><p>but is now attempting to put the breaks on the government\'s </p><p>reform drive.  CHP is in a bind: the party does not want to </p><p>appear to be on the wrong side of pro-reform public opinion, </p><p>but it also wants to reflect military-Turkish State equities </p><p>-- and is loath to get too far ahead of the generals and </p><p>other elements of the Establishment.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Package in Sezer\'s Hands </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Parliament last week adopted the sixth EU reform </p><p>package, which President Sezer now must either sign or send </p><p>back to the legislature by 4 July.  The package included most </p><p>of what the ruling AK Party had originally proposed, minus </p><p>some proposals that main opposition CHP had raised with us </p><p>previously as redlines (ref A).  Building on this momentum, </p><p>AK has promised a seventh -- and possibly an eighth -- </p><p>package of comprehensive reforms including legislation that </p><p>would: 1) formally reduce the role of the military in </p><p>politics (ref B); and 2) make sweeping but as yet unspecified </p><p>constitutional changes, before Parliament goes on recess in </p><p>August. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Baykal Speaks </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Partly in order to break AK\'s momentum, CHP ("the </p><p>Party of Ataturk") is now expressing reservations about the </p><p>need for further reform so quickly.  In a June 24 press </p><p>interview, CHP leader Baykal averred that his party will not </p><p>support, at least for now, a seventh or eighth package of </p><p>EU-related legislation.  Baykal offered the following reasons: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- There is no need for further changes to the constitution </p><p>in order for Turkey to get a date to begin EU negotiations. </p><p>"When Portugal began negotiating with the EU, there was still </p><p>a clause in its constitution giving \'intervention authority\' </p><p>to the military."  Moreover, "(German Chancellor) Schroeder </p><p>and (French President) Chirac have already said it is all </p><p>done," he said; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The government should now focus on implementation of </p><p>existing reforms vice trying to push through more proposals; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHP will not endorse amending the constitution unless the </p><p>government first agrees to restrict parliamentary immunity, </p><p>which has protected M.P.s from prosecution for corruption or </p><p>other criminal charges. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Baykal Praises TGS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In his June 24 speech before the CHP parliamentary </p><p>group, Baykal led off with particularly strong praise for the </p><p>military\'s ostensible support for reform, including the </p><p>General Staff\'s recent decision to reduce length of </p><p>obligatory military service for conscripts.  Baykal expressed </p><p>the timing of the decision as "perfect," and as "a decision </p><p>that suits the Armed Forces."  (Note: some mainstream press </p><p>commentators suggest that the TGS made the move now in part </p><p>to undercut increasingly vocal calls for budgetary and other </p><p>military-related reforms.  The idea has been a pet project of </p><p>TGS Chief Gen. Ozkok for years, however.  The military began </p><p>staff action on the issue as soon as Ozkok assumed office </p><p>last year.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>M.P.s Falling In </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In separate meetings June 25, CHP M.P.s Mehmet </p><p>Yildirim and Engin Altay confirmed to poloff that while CHP </p><p>wholeheartedly supports EU membership, the party will not </p><p>back additional reform packages as they are currently </p><p>envisioned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Both objected to the government couching the reforms in EU </p><p>terms only, and said that the government "should focus on </p><p>those things that are good for the country, not just good for </p><p>EU membership."  Altay, member of the Human Rights Committee, </p><p>explained that "Turkey should make these changes because it </p><p>is good for the Turkish people, not because the EU wants </p><p>Turkey to."  (Note: PM Erdogan and AK say the same thing, </p><p>even as they support rapid reform.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Echoing Baykal -- and each other -- the M.P.s lamented </p><p>that AK had not yet addressed immunity, which they insist </p><p>should be AK\'s first priority before undertaking more changes </p><p>to the constitution. </p><p>-- Both claimed that one of CHP\'s objections is that AK does </p><p>not share enough information with the opposition (note: a </p><p>charge CHP also leveled at AK during the run-up to the </p><p>negative 1 March vote on deployment of U.S. troops.  End </p><p>note).  Yildirim, a garlic grower from Kastamonu province </p><p>with ties to Baykal going back two decades, averred that CHP </p><p>never knows what AKP will try to include in the reform </p><p>packages.  As an example, Yildirim pointed to AK\'s apparent </p><p>desire to increase by several thousand the number of </p><p>employees at the Religious Affairs Directorate (Diyanet -- </p><p>septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In citing the importance of implementation of existing </p><p>reforms, Baykal makes an important point.  However, whether </p><p>this objection and CHP\'s attempt to force AK to amend the </p><p>constitution to lift parliamentary immunity legitimize CHP\'s </p><p>policy of legislative delay are another matter.  On the </p><p>reform issue, CHP is caught in a bind.  On the one hand, it </p><p>wants EU membership and therefore must be careful not to be </p><p>seen as opposing Turkey\'s EU drive.  On the other hand, CHP </p><p>-- already gearing up for local elections, which must be held </p><p>by April 2004 -- wants to prevent AK from taking too much </p><p>credit.  Moreover, the party is: 1) highly sensitive to </p><p>arguments espoused in military and other Establishment </p><p>circles about the potential danger to the status quo </p><p>presented by EU-related reforms; and 2) temperamentally </p><p>ill-suited to getting ahead of the rest of the Establishment </p><p>on such issues.  As always, CHP will listen intently for cues </p><p>from such circles while formulating its approach. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
