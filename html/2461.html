<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000586 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ECPS, ECPS, IT, ITECON </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S LUNCH WITH MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U)  DURING HIS INITIAL MEETING WITH THE MINISTER OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00586  01 OF 02  061352Z </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS, THE AMBASSADOR PROMOTED MOTOROLA\'S BID FOR </p><p>THE TENDER FOR A NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY DIGITAL MOBILE </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, SOUGHT FAIR MARKET ACCESS FOR U.S. </p><p>FIRMS, AND OUTLINED THE U.S. MILITARY\'S NEED FOR RADIO AND </p><p>TELEVISION COMMUNICATIONS FREQUENCIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U)  MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, MAURIZIO GASPARRI, </p><p>HOSTED THE AMBASSADOR AT LUNCH THURSDAY, JANUARY 31. </p><p>UNDER-SECRETARY GIANCARLO INNOCENZI AND MIN. GIANFRANCO </p><p>GIORGOLO, THE DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, DCM POPE, AND ECMIN DEAN </p><p>ALSO ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>AFNS </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U)  THE AMBASSADOR USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THE </p><p>NEED OF THE US AMERICAN FORCES NETWORK SOUTH (AFNS) TO </p><p>PROVIDE RADIO AND TELEVISION COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS TO THE </p><p>U.S. MILITARY COMMUNITY IN ITALY (AROUND 65,000 PEOPLE) AS </p><p>NECESSARY FOR FORCE PROTECTION AND FOR MORALE.  SINCE THE </p><p>ITALIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE WILL NOT EXTEND LOANER </p><p>FREQUENCIES BEYOND THE END OF 2002, DOD IS CONCERNED THAT WE </p><p>MAY LOSE OUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH OFF-DUTY MILITARY </p><p>AND THEIR FAMILIES.  THE MINISTER SAID THAT HE WOULD LOOK </p><p>INTO IT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) ON FRIDAY, FEB. 1, ING. GIGANTINO FROM THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF COMMUNICATION AND THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE FOR TRACKING </p><p>THE AFNS ISSUE, CALLED US SENDING STATE OFFICE AND THE </p><p>ECONOMIC MINISTER SEPARATELY TO SAY THAT THE MINISTRY WOULD </p><p>HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND ITALIAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00586  01 OF 02  061352Z </p><p>DEFENSE GENERAL STAFF (IDGS) EXTENDING THE LOAN OF THE </p><p>FREQUENCIES BEYOND THE END OF THE YEAR AS LONG AS THE MOD AND </p><p>IDGS AGREED.  THE MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATION, HOWEVER, HAS NO </p><p>CIVILIAN FREQUENCIES THAT THEY COULD LEND.  THE MINISTRY </p><p>WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE U.S. PROPOSALS WERE FOR A SOLUTION </p><p>WHEN THE LOAN PERIOD EXPIRES AT THE END OF THE YEAR. </p><p>(COMMENT:  DESPITE THE MINISTER\'S OPTIMISTIC VIEW THAT HE </p><p>COULD FIX THIS, THE FOLLOW-UP CALL INDICATES ESSENTIALLY NO </p><p>PROGRESS.) </p><p> </p><p>FAIR MARKET ACCESS FOR U.S. FIRMS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR ALSO EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO HAVE A </p><p>LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IN THE BUSINESS WORLD.  ITALY AND THE </p><p>U.S. ARE IN AN INCREASINGLY GLOBAL MARKET PLACE AND THE RULES </p><p>NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT AND FAIR.  IF IT TAKES ONLY TWO DAYS </p><p>FOR AN AMERICAN TO SWITCH TELEPHONE PROVIDERS, AND 12 DAYS IN </p><p>EUROPE, IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT SHOULD 28-35 DAYS IN </p><p>ITALY.  SUCH DELAYS LOOK LIKE A BARRIER TO THOSE COMPANIES </p><p>WHO WISH TO PROVIDE COMMERCIAL ALTERNATIVES TO THE MONOPOLY </p><p>PROVIDER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER AS AN </p><p>EXAMPLE WHERE THE U.S. WAS LOOKING FOR TOP QUALITY PARTNERS, </p><p>THOSE WHO PRODUCE TOP-NOTCH PRODUCTS.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO </p><p>ITALY\'S BECOMING A PARTNER IN THE JSF.  EVERYONE WOULD BE </p><p>ABLE TO COMPETE FOR CONTRACTS, AND THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO SEE ON ITALY\'S SIDE. </p><p> </p><p>MOTOROLA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00586  01 OF 02  061352Z </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) REINFORCING THE EMBASSY\'S ADVOCACY WITH ITALY FOR </p><p>MOTOROLA TO WIN AN ITALIAN INTERIOR MINISTRY TENDER FOR A </p><p>NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY DIGITAL MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR AGAIN EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR \'BUYING THE </p><p>BEST\' AND \'MOTOROLA TECHNOLOGY IN THIS FIELD IS THE BEST\'. </p><p>THE MINISTER UNDERLINED THAT THIS IS NOT A MINISTRY OF </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS DECISION, BUT THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S CONCERN THAT THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS BE OPEN. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR REITERATED THAT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ALSO </p><p>REQUIRES AN OPENNESS IN TENDERING AND MAKING SELECTION </p><p>DECISIONS.  (COMMENT:  EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A MINISTRY OF </p><p>INTERIOR DECISION, WE BELIEVE THAT GASPARRI IS LIKELY TO BE A </p><p>KEY PLAYER IN THE SELECTION PROCESS.) </p><p> </p><p>WIRELESS LOCAL LOOP </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) GASPARRI NOTED THAT THEY WERE HAVING A COMPETITION </p><p>FOR THE FIXED TELEPHONE WIRELESS LOCAL LOOP WHICH SHOULD </p><p>IMPROVE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER.  IN MOBILE TELEPHONY THERE </p><p>ARE FOUR COMPETITORS AND SO SERVICE IS GOOD, BUT IN FIXED </p><p>TELEPHONY THERE IS A DOMINANT OPERATOR WHO CONTROLS THE </p><p>MARKET AND SO THERE IS LITTLE COMPETITION AND LESS SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2952 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00586  02 OF 02  061352Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CIP-00   COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  FCC-01   VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PM-00    ACE-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  SNIS-00 </p><p>      NISC-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------62D6D5  061352Z /38 </p><p>R 061330Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 1995 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000586 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ECPS, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S LUNCH WITH MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS </p><p> </p><p>HE THOUGHT IT IS NECESSARY TO LIBERALIZE THE MARKET AND </p><p>IMPROVE THE CHOICES AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>BIO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00586  02 OF 02  061352Z </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>9.
