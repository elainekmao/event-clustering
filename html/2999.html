<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001237 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, AS KANSTEINER AND PDAS BELLAMY; ALSO FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAGR, ECON, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MAY 22 DISCUSSIONS WITH MDC MP DAVID COLTART </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM REWhitehead due to 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (c)  Summary:  Ambassador and DCM met with MDC MP and </p><p>shadow justice minister David Coltart over breakfast on May </p><p>22.  Coltart addressed his personal security and his upcoming </p><p>trip abroad, then described developments in the MDC\'s legal </p><p>challenge of the results of the March 2002 presidential </p><p>election.  Coltart also described his recent meetings with </p><p>commercial farmers and a dawning GOZ awareness of the </p><p>ramifications of its wayward agricultural policies.  He noted </p><p>that certain, more radical elements of the MDC favor mass </p><p>action, but he expressed his belief that this would not </p><p>succeed and that attempts to impose quick fixes are </p><p>unrealistic.  Coltart concluded with comments on outstanding </p><p>legal cases that pit the MDC against ZANU-PF.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Security Concerns </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c) The Ambassador recounted to Coltart his recent </p><p>conversation with Congressman Royce in which the latter had </p><p>described credible death threats against Coltart relayed to </p><p>Royce by Orange County constituents of Zimbabwean origin. </p><p>The Ambassador observed that Royce felt that Coltart\'s best </p><p>option was to leave Zimbabwe.  Coltart replied that he did </p><p>not think that he was in any clear danger; instead, he viewed </p><p>the ZANU-PF threats as mind games.  The Ambassador asked </p><p>Coltart about the whereabouts of his family and whether </p><p>threats had been directed toward them.  Coltart responded </p><p>that they were at home in Bulawayo, and that there had been </p><p>only "indirect" threats. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Plans to Travel Abroad </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c) Coltart continued that while he had no intention to </p><p>"go hide overseas," he did intend to leave on May 26 for a </p><p>month-long trip to the UK, USA, and Canada.  He planned to be </p><p>in Washington between June 10 and 14 and hoped to meet with </p><p>Assistant Secretary Kansteiner, PDAS Bellamy, various human </p><p>rights groups, the American Bar Association, and the </p><p>International Bar Association.  His goal was to recruit </p><p>outside observers to attend the upcoming MDC challenge before </p><p>the High Court of ZANU-PF\'s victory in the March 2002 </p><p>Presidential Election. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c) He readily admitted that the MDC expected the GOZ to </p><p>steer the case to a High Court judge sympathetic to ZANU-PF </p><p>in order to shield the Supreme Court and Mugabe-appointed </p><p>Chief Justice Chidyausiku from dealing with the case.  What </p><p>MDC sought was high-level international attention to the case </p><p>that would bring pressure to bear on the Zimbabwean </p><p>judiciary.  To this end, the MDC was in contact with an </p><p>eminent South African lawyer named Gauntlet who had been </p><p>recommended to Coltart by the ANC.  Coltart said that the </p><p>Rhodesian born Gauntlet had left Rhodesia as a young man </p><p>because of his father\'s rejection of Ian Smith\'s UDI regime. </p><p>A Rhodes scholar with offices in both Johannesburg and </p><p>London, Gauntlet was widely viewed in Southern Africa as one </p><p>of the finest trial lawyers on the scene.  Coltart said that </p><p>he would meet with Gauntlet later in the day to discuss the </p><p>possibility of "Operation Gauntlet," an MDC initiative to </p><p>turn the legal challenge into a media event that would </p><p>embarrass ZANU-PF and maintain an international focus on </p><p>Zimbabwe.  He cautioned that scant MDC resources could be the </p><p>limiting factor in what looked to be an eight-week long trial, </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c) Coltart said that abundant evidence was pouring in, </p><p>so much that it would be necessary to do a legal triage to </p><p>avoid the abundance of facts from obscuring the central </p><p>themes.  The MDC planned to forward constitutional arguments, </p><p>especially on Mugabe\'s unconstitutional use of statutory </p><p>instruments.  They would supplement this with irrefutable </p><p>technical arguments, such as the Registrar General\'s failure </p><p>to produce the voters\' rolls.  The MDC legal team would steer </p><p>clear of basing their case on pre-electoral violence, since </p><p>this could only produce a series of witnesses pitting one\'s </p><p>word against the other\'s. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>The Food Crisis </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c) The Ambassador noted that Zimbabwe\'s looming food </p><p>crisis would once again focus international attention on </p><p>Zimbabwe; should Coltart engage the press while abroad, he </p><p>should stress the rich contribution of errant GOZ </p><p>agricultural policies to the crisis, both in Zimbabwe and </p><p>regionally.  Coltart said that it appeared that the enormity </p><p>of the crisis had finally begun to dawn on GOZ leadership. </p><p>In Chinhoyi, Mashonaland West Governor Chinetsa recently met </p><p>with war vets and police and instructed them to let </p><p>commercial farmers return to farming.  Last weekend, Mugabe </p><p>and several of his ministers had toured farming areas and met </p><p>with several commercial farmers.  Mugabe had urged them to </p><p>put in the winter wheat crop and -- according to another </p><p>source -- expressed surprise and then chastised his entourage </p><p>when a farmer informed him that he could not undertake </p><p>farming activities because he had received a Section Eight </p><p>acquisition notice and because all of his irrigation pipes </p><p>had been stolen. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c) Coltart observed that the apparent ZANU-PF change of </p><p>heart was too late -- the final date for putting in winter </p><p>wheat had already passed.  In addition, necessary inputs are </p><p>not available.  The government had approached the leading </p><p>irrigation equipment dealer from Bulawayo with open </p><p>pocketbook only to learn it would take him a minimum of two </p><p>months to import enough material to put irrigated commercial </p><p>agriculture back on its feet.  Coltart said that his own </p><p>recent tour of the farming heartland around Gweru and Kwekwe </p><p>had revealed the low morale of the commercial farmers, many </p><p>of whom are planning to leave.  He added that it was </p><p>difficult to say exactly how many farmers remained </p><p>countrywide on their farms.  In Matebeleland South, only five </p><p>farmers had been evicted.  In Marondera, 23 or 24 farmers had </p><p>vacated. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c) Coltart charged that the Commercial Farmers\' Union </p><p>had not provided strong leadership.  The MDC has sought to </p><p>champion the farmers\' cause by drafting a contract that sets </p><p>three basic pre-conditions:  an all or nothing approach that </p><p>exempts all commercial farmers from harassment; the </p><p>unhindered access of farmers to their fields, and a </p><p>concomitant return to rural rule of law; and the removal of </p><p>Section Eight provisions.  Coltart said that at this juncture </p><p>few farmers are willing to risk a Section Eight provision </p><p>that mandates two-years\' imprisonment for any farmer who </p><p>attempts to till his land after a Section Eight has been </p><p>served.  He added that this amendment rammed through by </p><p>Justice Minister Chinamasa in the most recent rump session of </p><p>Parliament was doomed to be stricken down by the courts, </p><p>since once again Chinamasa had suspended procedural rules and </p><p>rammed the amendment through absent the legally constituted </p><p>Legal Committee of three that must review the law. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Prospects for Mass Action </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c) The Ambassador cited newspaper reports on calls for </p><p>mass action and asked Coltart if he thought this constituted </p><p>a viable option.  Coltart replied that he did not believe </p><p>that it could work and that, in fact, it would probably play </p><p>to Mugabe\'s strength.  He mused that perhaps a two-day </p><p>stay-away might prove the point that the population is </p><p>unhappy.  Coltart said that based on their most recent </p><p>conversation, Morgan Tsvangirai shared this view.  However, </p><p>there is a minority of MDC hawks who favor muscular action </p><p>now.  Coltart noted that almost all of these were Shona, </p><p>mostly from Harare.  He felt that it was possible that some </p><p>of these might be agent provocateurs planted by ZANU-PF.  The </p><p>Ambassador said that we are concerned about Tsvangirai\'s </p><p>ability to control violent outbreaks that the GOZ could use </p><p>as a pretext to move against the MDC.  Coltart responded that </p><p>there is no quick fix solution to Zimbabwe\'s woes.  However, </p><p>it is essential to hold out some minimal hope.  This was one </p><p>reason why the MDC continued to pursue its legal challenge to </p><p>Mugabe\'s election "victory." </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Legal Skirmishes </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (c) Coltart described the ongoing legal tit for tat </p><p>between ZANU-PF and MDC.  He observed that the GOZ has shown </p><p>no enthusiasm for pressing forward on the treason case </p><p>against Tsvangirai.  The GOZ also continues to harass Coltart </p><p>and other Bulawayo based MDC leaders charged with either </p><p>weapons violations or the 2001 murder of ZANU-PF activist </p><p>Cain Nkala, but they have brought none of these cases to </p><p>trial.  Coltart said that this may be partly due to the fact </p><p>that the courts have not yet acted on the disapperance case </p><p>of Coltart\'s polling agent Patrick Nabanyama, who was </p><p>abducted by three men in front of his family in June 2000 and </p><p>then turned over to other ZANU-PF supporters who allegedly </p><p>murdered him.  The body has never been found, and now the </p><p>prosecution has released the alleged killers and charged the </p><p>four kidnappers with murder, but not kidnapping.  In the </p><p>absence of the body or any corroborating evidence, Coltart </p><p>said, the three men cannot be convicted, and everyone will go </p><p>free.  Once the prosecutors have disposed of this case, </p><p>predicted Coltart, they will set their sights on the MDC </p><p>supporters accused of murdering Nkala. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (c) Coltart was surprisingly upbeat about the reigning </p><p>situation.  He seems prepared to take a peaceful, tactical </p><p>approach that will prolong ZANU-PF\'s international isolation </p><p>and wait for the inevitable results of GOZ policy </p><p>mismanagement, including the food crisis, to further weaken </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s base of support.  Coltart clearly appreciates that </p><p>failed mass action risks undermining the credibility of the </p><p>MDC, and fracturing its disparate base of support.  On his </p><p>own safety, Coltart still believes that intimidation and not </p><p>elimination is the ZANU-PF strategy.  Fellow MDC MP Roy </p><p>Bennett expressed the same views during a separate meeting </p><p>with DCM and Poloff on May 22, although he admitted that </p><p>certain hard-line elements of ZANU-PF can be very </p><p>unpredictable. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
