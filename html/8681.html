<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003814 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: IR, KNNP, MNUC, PARM, IAEA </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT FULLY CONCURS WITH USG ASSESSMENT OF DG </p><p>ELBARADEI\'S REPORT, PROMISES FULL SUPPORT AT THE JUNE 16 </p><p>BOG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 158048 </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 152375 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 3751 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On June 12, we delivered ref A demarche, following up </p><p>on ref B demarche (reported in ref C). The GOT has gone over </p><p>ElBaradei\'s report with great care and fully concurred with </p><p>USG concerns over Iran\'s pattern of deception with regard to </p><p>its nuclear program. MFA Disarmament Head Ibrahim Yagli </p><p>promised full support for the USG approach for the June 16 </p><p>Board of Governors meeting. He also expressed thanks for the </p><p>non-paper, noting that it would be valuable in the crafting </p><p>of the GOT\'s national statement for the June 16 meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Yagli also stressed the need for appropriate follow-up </p><p>to the June 16 meeting, to ensure that the issue of Iran\'s </p><p>nuclear program continues to receive close attention by the </p><p>Board. He concurred with the proposal in ref A for another DG </p><p>report to a special Board session before the next regularly </p><p>scheduled Board meeting. However, he suggested that the Board </p><p>go one step further by also requesting more frequent, </p><p>"informal," reports on inspections in Iran by the IAEA </p><p>Secretariat (whether orally, in written format, or both). </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>These "spot" reports would lead up to the formal DG report. </p><p>(COMMENT: We believe Yagli\'s suggestion is quite useful and </p><p>recommend full consideration by Washington.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
