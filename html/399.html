<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 04818 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356 DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:PREL, MOPS, CASC, PINS, SHUM, SREF, KU, IZ, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT:TFKUO1: TIGHTENING THE NOOSE ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  NOW THAT WE HAVE OBTAINED UNSC RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE </p><p>USE OF FORCE TO ENFORCE THE SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ, I PRESUME </p><p>THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO KEEP THE UNSC ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND </p><p>RATCHET UP THE REAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE ON IRAQ AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME.  FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IT APPEARS THAT THIS MIGHT BE </p><p>DONE BY BEGINNING TO SET UP MECHANISMS TO HOLD THE GOI AND </p><p>IDENTIFIABLE GOI OFFICIALS COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE LAW OF </p><p>NATIONS AND SPECIFIC UNSC RESOLUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AS A FIRST CUT, IT SEEMS FROM HERE THAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER </p><p>TWO DISTINCT TRACKS SEPERATELY OR IN TANDEM: </p><p> </p><p>   -- CRIMES AGAINST INTERNATIONAL LAW, HUMANITY AND WAR CRIMES: </p><p>      THE FIRST TRACK WOULD BE A TRIBUNAL, BASED UPON THE </p><p>      NUREMBURG PRECENDENT, TO TRY PERSONS CRIMINALLY WHO </p><p>      FORMULATE, PUBLICIZE, IMPLEMENT OR JUSTIFY ACTIONS IN </p><p>      CONTRAVENTION OF POSITIVE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND NORMS OF </p><p>      COMITY.  THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGN NATIONALS IN IRAQ AND </p><p>      IRAQI-OCCUPIED KUWAIT, AGAINST KUWAITIS AS A RESULT OF </p><p>      THE IRAQI AGGRESSION, FORCED LABOR, DENIAL OF CRITICAL </p><p>      MEDICAL CARE AND TREATMENT, ETC.  WOULD FALL WITHIN THIS </p><p>      CATEGORY. </p><p> </p><p>   -- REPARATIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF KUWAIT, FOREIGN </p><p>      GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE KUWAITI AND FOREIGN CITIZENS FOR </p><p>      LOSSES, THEFT, WRONGFUL IMPRISONMENT, ETC. SUCH ACTIVITY </p><p>      WOULD HELP TO DRIVE HOME TO THE IRAQI REGIME THAT THE </p><p>      INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NOT ONLY WILL NOT PERMIT IT TO RETAIN </p><p>      OR BENEFIT FROM ITS AGGRESSION AGAINST KUWAIT, BUT WILL HOLD IT </p><p>      LIABLE FOR THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER HARM DONE BY ITS ANNOUNCED </p><p>      POLICIES.  IT WOULD ALSO LAY THE BASIS FOR THE USG, AND OTHER </p><p>      GOVERNMENTS, TO RECOVER COSTS OF DESTRUCTION, EVACUATION, ETC. </p><p>      AND GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND PRIVATE CITIZENS TO RECOVER LOSSES </p><p>      OF PERSONAL PROPERTY RESULTING FROM THE IRAQI INVASION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOWELL </p><p></p></div>
