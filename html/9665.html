<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 HARARE 001503 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, OES </p><p>USAID FOR AFR/SA, AFR/SD </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>DEPT OF INTERIOR FOR USFWS, DFERGUSON AND KSTROMAYER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, EINV, ETRD, SENV, ZI, Environment </p><p>SUBJECT: Environmental Impact of the Current Crises on </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s Wildlife </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  This report, focusing on the status of wildlife </p><p>in Zimbabwe, will be the first of several related reports on </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s deteriorating environmental situation.  The </p><p>combination of land seizures, economic pressure, general </p><p>lawlessness, and hunger have taken a heavy toll on </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s wildlife.  Attempts to quantify the situation are </p><p>difficult, but at the most basic level, it is possible to </p><p>estimate the impact of poaching on Zimbabwe as follows, from </p><p>least affected to most affected: </p><p>--  large animals in national parks </p><p>    (negligible impact, possibly 2.5%); </p><p>--  large animals in conservancies </p><p>    (minimal impact, possibly 5%); </p><p>--  protected animals (e.g., black rhino) in national parks </p><p>    (limited impact, possibly 4-5%); </p><p>--  protected animals (e.g., black rhino) in conservancies </p><p>    (limited impact, possibly 5-6%); </p><p>--  plains animals in national parks </p><p>    (significant impact, in some areas as high as 30-40%); </p><p>--  plains animals in conservancies </p><p>    (high impact, in some areas as high as 60%); </p><p>--  plains animals on private farms in commercial </p><p>    agricultural regions </p><p>    (catastrophic impact, upwards of 90%). </p><p>Although these numbers and percentages are estimates, and </p><p>subject to the inaccuracies inherent in estimation, the </p><p>scope of the problem cannot be overstated.  Unless steps are </p><p>taken to limit the impact of the current depredation on </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s wildlife, the country will face a bleak </p><p>environmental future when the dust finally settles.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  While Zimbabwe has received widespread condemnation for </p><p>the devastating impact of poaching on wildlife, few reports </p><p>have documented the full extent of the damage.  Poaching -- </p><p>both on private and public land -- has escalated </p><p>dramatically due to numerous factors, including widespread </p><p>hunger, movement of "settlers" into lands previously </p><p>dedicated to wildlife, and the general breakdown of law and </p><p>order.  Many poachers kill animals in an attempt to feed </p><p>their families.  Many settlers kill animals while clearing </p><p>new land and attempting to establish dominion over newly- </p><p>occupied territory.  In other incidents, commercial </p><p>operators are taking advantage of the relative chaos by </p><p>marketing "bush meat" and smuggling rhino horns.  Some </p><p>highly subjective claims, such as one group\'s allegations </p><p>that "Ninety percent of Zimbabwe\'s wildlife has been </p><p>slaughtered," have gained widespread circulation despite the </p><p>lack of empirical evidence.  However, while it is clear that </p><p>wildlife has suffered from the current political crisis, </p><p>quantifying the damage remains a Herculean task. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Many poachers throughout the country rely on wire </p><p>snares, which indiscriminately kill any animal unfortunate </p><p>enough to stray within reach.  In other areas, communal </p><p>farmers or settlers use packs of hunting dogs to flush and </p><p>run down antelope, zebra, or other plains animals.  Some </p><p>landowners have reported a pattern of settler activity in </p><p>which a settler will build a small stick-and-thatch hut as a </p><p>hunting base, and proceed to poach all animals within range </p><p>of that hut.  Once the easy poaching is finished, the </p><p>settler will move on, clear enough woodland for a new hut, </p><p>and begin poaching the new territory.  Although some of this </p><p>meat is undoubtedly filling the pot of hungry settlers, much </p><p>of this meat has reportedly made it to commercial butcheries </p><p>in the large towns.  Some recent reports indicate that </p><p>poaching is reaching commercial proportions with </p><p>international implications.  Several rhino poachers arrested </p><p>in July are suspected to be Zambians.  Also in July, a group </p><p>of twelve South African sport hunters was arrested while </p><p>trying to export over 400 kg of game meat reportedly taken </p><p>on an occupied farm. Despite claims that their permits were </p><p>in order, there is no evidence of compliance with any of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s strict statutory requirements for international </p><p>hunters. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>QUANTIFYING THE DAMAGE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Wildlife in Zimbabwe can be classified by its size, its </p><p>protected/non-protected status, and its location, all of </p><p>which affect the impact of poaching.  First, large animals, </p><p>such as elephant and buffalo, are more resistant to random </p><p>poaching due to their sheer size and strength.  A great deal </p><p>of Zimbabwe\'s widespread poaching is opportunistic, and what </p><p>is killed depends upon which animals stray into the </p><p>thousands of wire snares littering the bush.  Large animals </p><p>which can break out of such snares might still die if snare </p><p>wounds become infected, but many survive with few ill </p><p>effects.  Second, some animals, such as rhinos, cheetahs, </p><p>painted hunting dogs, and pangolins, are protected (to some </p><p>degree) by the GOZ; other animals, such as antelope, </p><p>giraffes, lions, and leopards, are not.   Much of the non- </p><p>protected wildlife, particularly "plains animals" such as </p><p>impala, eland, kudu, sable, wildebeest, and zebra, are </p><p>widely hunted for food, while others are highly valued as </p><p>trophies.  Some of the protected wildlife is hunted </p><p>opportunistically, while others -- such as rhinos -- offer </p><p>poachers commercial benefit, but require deliberate and well- </p><p>equipped pursuit.  Finally, some wild animals inhabit state- </p><p>owned parks or privately-owned conservancies, while many </p><p>others previously lived on privately-owned commercial farms. </p><p>Even now, some animals in parks and conservancies have </p><p>escaped wholesale slaughter, while wildlife which inhabited </p><p>regions formerly dominated by commercial farms has been </p><p>almost completely hunted out. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SIZE </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  The size of an animal has a direct impact on its </p><p>susceptibility to the opportunistic poaching taking place in </p><p>many wildlife areas.  Although neither elephant nor buffalo </p><p>are specifically protected under Zimbabwean law, both </p><p>require deliberate and well-armed pursuit; needless to say, </p><p>snaring has a limited effect such animals. (Rhinos are </p><p>considered separately, below.)  In Save Conservancy, for </p><p>instance, while carcasses of 715 poached impala have been </p><p>recovered by game scouts, only 6 poached elephant and 3 </p><p>poached buffalo have been identified.  Some large animals </p><p>simply are not hindered by snares set low enough for the </p><p>small plains game; other large animals become entangled, but </p><p>manage to break out of the snare.  Sometimes such snare </p><p>wounds fester and finally kill the animal; in some </p><p>instances, elephants have been found with severed trunks. </p><p>In other cases the snares are shaken off and the animals </p><p>recover with few side effects.  Pursuit with dogs, </p><p>similarly, is a tactic suitable for smaller animals, but </p><p>dangerous for larger, stronger and more aggressive animals. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Elephant is one of the few species which has actually </p><p>increased in number, even in the chaotic and lawless </p><p>situation prevalent in much of Zimbabwe\'s rural lands. </p><p>Conservationists estimate that although the Zimbabwe has a </p><p>carrying capacity for about 45,000 elephants, the current </p><p>population is more than double that number.  The most recent </p><p>survey, conducted in 2001, indicated herds of around 89,000. </p><p>Using a growth rate 3-4%, Dr. Cumming, previously the Chief </p><p>Research Officer and Deputy Director of the National Parks, </p><p>estimates that the herds now comprise more than 100,000 </p><p>animals.  The largest factor underlying this phenomenal </p><p>growth, in addition to the elephant\'s relative </p><p>imperviousness to casual poaching, is the international </p><p>Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species </p><p>(CITES) ban on the ivory trade.  Under that ban, countries </p><p>such as the U.S. prohibit the importation of ivory and other </p><p>elephant products.  Despite the ban, however, hunters (even </p><p>American hunters) are still allowed to kill trophy </p><p>elephants, and the current rate for trophy bulls is held at </p><p>about .5% of the population -- which maintains both the </p><p>population as well as the trophy quality. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>PROTECTED STATUS -- RHINOS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Black rhinos, one of the most endangered species </p><p>worldwide and one of the few species to have officially </p><p>protected status in Zimbabwe, have also been somewhat spared </p><p>from the widespread devastation.  Under Zimbabwean law, </p><p>wildlife belongs to no individual, but a property owner or </p><p>occupier can use whatever wildlife that can be captured or </p><p>"possessed" on his property.  Rhinos, however, officially </p><p>belong to the GOZ.  There have been a number of successful </p><p>black rhino translocations, but even where the animals have </p><p>been placed on private land, the private landowner is merely </p><p>a custodian and not an owner.  When Zimbabwe achieved </p><p>independence in 1980, it was home to approximately 2,000 </p><p>black rhino, with a concentration of about 1,400 -- the </p><p>largest population in the world -- in the Zambezi valley. </p><p>Widespread commercial poaching (defined as poaching in which </p><p>the horn is removed for sale) decimated the black rhino </p><p>population in the late 1980\'s throughout Zimbabwe, and the </p><p>number declined to about 370.  The GOZ established four </p><p>Intensive Protection Zones (IPZs) in state land areas, to </p><p>concentrate available government anti-poaching resources on </p><p>the few relatively high-density rhino populations that </p><p>survived the waves of poaching.  These four IPZs are </p><p>Sinamatella (in Hwange National Park), Matusadona (on the </p><p>southern shore of Lake Kariba), Matobo (near Bulawayo) and </p><p>Chipinge (on the eastern side of Zimbabwe).   Due to the </p><p>intensive conservation measures undertaken, Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>population increased to about 520 black rhinos by 2000. </p><p> </p><p>8.   Prior to the land invasions, almost 75% of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>black rhinos inhabited commercial farms and conservancies, </p><p>with approximately 200 in the Lowveld conservancies of Save </p><p>Valley and  Bubiana.  According to conservation experts with </p><p>the World Wide Fund for Nature, "Since early 2000, the rhino </p><p>custodianship scheme has been greatly undermined because of </p><p>large-scale invasions by subsistence farmers into areas of </p><p>commercial ranching land, throughout Zimbabwe.  Peasant </p><p>subsistence farming and rhino conservation are mutually </p><p>exclusive activities.  Hence the invasions into at least a </p><p>third of the total area of the rhino custodianship areas in </p><p>southern Zimbabwe have displaced significant numbers of </p><p>rhinos out of their home ranges and thereby stimulated </p><p>fighting between the animals, leading to many injuries and </p><p>the deaths of at least two black rhinos. Habitats are being </p><p>cleared for patchy settlement and extensive bush fires that </p><p>have arisen in this process have swept through </p><p>conservancies, killing at least one black rhino calf. " </p><p> </p><p>9.  Despite the increased pressure on the habitat of rhinos </p><p>and the competition between animals and settlers, there have </p><p>only been a handful of documented commercial rhino poaching </p><p>incidents since 2000.  Four incidents were confirmed on the </p><p>Bubiana Conservancy, eight incidents were confirmed in </p><p>Hwange National Park, and one incident was confirmed in </p><p>Matusadona National Park.  Several other incidents have been </p><p>alleged but not confirmed.  Many factors contribute to the </p><p>increase in rhino poaching, despite an international </p><p>moratorium on the sale of rhino horns.  Conservationists </p><p>implemented a massive de-horning campaign in the mid-1990s, </p><p>but most animals\' horns have since grown back, making them </p><p>once again attractive targets.  The lack of resources to </p><p>support game scouts and anti-poaching units has decreased </p><p>their effectiveness; the increasing "war-lord" mentality of </p><p>many rural areas, where a powerful local man can take what </p><p>he wants, has also been noted.  Additionally, heavily armed </p><p>"military" personnel were implicated in several of the </p><p>poaching incidents around the Sinamatella camp in Hwange. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The total black rhino loss due to land invasions and </p><p>associated snaring within Save Valley and Bubiana </p><p>Conservancies is probably 15-20 animals.  Losses in other </p><p>areas, such as Gourlays, Hwange and Matusadona, could be as </p><p>high.  Recent press statements have suggested that some 50 </p><p>rhinos, black and white, have been poached during the land </p><p>invasions.  The known losses due to poaching (as of early </p><p>April, 2003) are less than this figure and do not include </p><p>any white rhinos, but there will definitely be some rhino </p><p>snaring cases that have not yet been detected or reported. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>LOCATION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  NATIONAL PARKS.  Zimbabwe has approximately 49,000 </p><p>square kilometers (km2) of state-owned "protected areas." </p><p>Under Zimbabwe\'s framework, these protected areas are </p><p>delineated as follows:  national parks, safari areas (or </p><p>parks which allow hunting), recreational parks, sanctuaries, </p><p>botanical gardens, botanical reserves, and forestry lands. </p><p>Protected areas in Zimbabwe currently break down into </p><p>several major clusters, in which a national park is </p><p>surrounded by safari areas, recreational parks, and forest </p><p>lands.  The most significant of these are: the northwestern </p><p>Matabeleland cluster (Hwange/Kazuma/Zambezi National Parks, </p><p>surrounded by the Matetsi and Deka Safari Areas); the </p><p>southeastern Gona-Re-Zhou National Park (now part of the </p><p>Transfrontier Park between Zimbabwe, South Africa, and </p><p>Mozambique, along with several neighboring private </p><p>conservancies); and the northeastern Zambezi Valley cluster </p><p>(Matusadona and Mana Pools National Parks, surrounded by </p><p>Charara, Sibilobilo, Hurungwe, Sapi, Chewore, Dande, and </p><p>Doma Safari Areas). </p><p> </p><p>12.  Although parks have traditionally offered some </p><p>protection from poaching to resident animals, that </p><p>protection has evaporated under the current economic and </p><p>political crisis.   Dr. David Cumming notes that the </p><p>international standard for effective park management runs at </p><p>about US $200-250 per km2.  The extreme range is represented </p><p>by white rhino conservancies in the KwaZuluNatal province of </p><p>South Africa, some of which reportedly spend about US $6,000 </p><p>per km2.  By comparison, he reports, the current Zimbabwe </p><p>budget allocates about US $10 per km2.  Combined with the </p><p>current political and economic meltdown, this lack of funds </p><p>translates directly into less protection for animals:  fewer </p><p>game scouts, fewer anti-poaching units, fewer vehicles, less </p><p>fuel, minimal interest in pursuing poachers, and minimal </p><p>sentences for those actually convicted. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Dr. Cumming cites, for example, the situation at the </p><p>Sengwa research center, located in the Charisa Safari Area. </p><p>Dr. Cumming lived at this location for almost twelve years, </p><p>and has taken groups of graduate students to the research </p><p>center for fieldwork for many years.  The research center is </p><p>surrounded by Chizarira National Park, Chete Safari Area, </p><p>and communal farmlands.  While the area has for many years </p><p>enjoyed an abundance of wildlife, Dr. Cumming reports that </p><p>it is almost completely decimated as of 2003.  When asked </p><p>whether wildlife could have moved elsewhere, he states that </p><p>the lack of animals is certainly due to poaching.  He notes </p><p>that most Zimbabwean animals are prevented from large-scale </p><p>migratory movements, such as those observed in Tanzania and </p><p>parts of Kenya, by the geographical differences between the </p><p>two regions.  He also notes that Zimbabwean wildlife </p><p>movement is limited by animals\' territorial attachments to </p><p>home ranges, dependence upon limited water sources, and </p><p>circumscription by surrounding hunting and farming areas. </p><p>Given that there is no place for the animals to have gone, </p><p>coupled with the hundreds of snares recovered in the area, </p><p>he concludes that they have been hunted to annihilation. </p><p> </p><p>14.  PRIVATELY-OWNED CONSERVANCIES.   Prior to the </p><p>commencement of the Land Resettlement Program, there were at </p><p>least five officially-recognized, privately-owned </p><p>conservancies (the multiple-property developments at Save </p><p>Valley Conservancy, Bubiana Conservancy, Chiredzi River </p><p>Conservancy, and the Bubi River Conservancy, and the single- </p><p>property resort of Malilangwe Conservancy).  The GOZ has </p><p>sometimes refused to recognize the legitimacy of other </p><p>conservancies, claiming that singly-owned conservancies such </p><p>as Gourlays Ranch or Amcit-owned Twin Springs Wildlife </p><p>conservancy did not meet the "official" definition of a </p><p>conservancy.  In reality, both Gourlays Ranch and Twin </p><p>Springs occupy coveted property, while many of the </p><p>"recognized" conservancies occupy marginal land in the </p><p>drought-prone lowveld. (Note:  In fact, when questioned </p><p>about the status of single-property conservancies, GOZ </p><p>officials usually launch into a history lesson and defense </p><p>of the entire land resettlement program, claiming that the </p><p>tendency of private landowners to go into wildlife </p><p>operations in the 1990s actually threatened Zimbabwe\'s food </p><p>security, necessitating the land-grab and redistribution </p><p>exercise.  The fact that food security was not at risk until </p><p>after the land resettlement program devastated agricultural </p><p>production is apparently moot.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>15.  Information provided by conservationists indicates that </p><p>several of the privately-owned conservancies have been </p><p>poached almost to extinction, while several others seem to </p><p>be maintaining some of their wildlife.  Gourlays Ranch and </p><p>Twin Springs Conservancy have been heavily poached, while </p><p>Gourlays has been occupied and both have been targeted for </p><p>acquisition under the Land Resettlement Program.  Chiredzi </p><p>River Conservancy and the Bubi River conservancy, although </p><p>not formally designated for acquisition, have been partially </p><p>settled and almost completely poached of plains animals. </p><p>Bubiana Conservancy reports that it has also been partially </p><p>settled and heavily poached in the northern section, </p><p>although conservation groups state that most of the rhino </p><p>population has been pushed into the southern section.  The </p><p>pressure of this displacement on Bubiana\'s male rhinos -- </p><p>which are territorial and solitary -- has led to fighting, </p><p>injury, and several documented deaths, while there are </p><p>several reports of commercial rhino poaching on the </p><p>conservancy. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Both Malilangwe and the Save Conservancy have been </p><p>accorded different treatment, and incurred different </p><p>damages.  Malilangwe, a 480-km2 conservancy which is singly- </p><p>owned by a trust (in which an Amcit is heavily involved), is </p><p>a very high-profile retreat which previously boasted an </p><p>international jet-set clientele, and that factor may account </p><p>for the difference in treatment from that accorded Gourlays </p><p>Ranch and Twin Springs Conservancy.  The manager of </p><p>Malilangwe reports that while poaching has been an issue in </p><p>outlying border areas, there have been no egregious </p><p>incidents recently and there is currently no occupation or </p><p>settlement. However, in a widely-publicized incident in </p><p>January 2003, provincial governor Josiah Hungwe sent a </p><p>letter to Malilangwe\'s Board of Directors demanding that two </p><p>Zanu-PF connected Zimbabwean businessmen be co-opted into </p><p>its Board of Directors.  The management at Malilangwe </p><p>reportedly forwarded this demand to the Board of Trustees </p><p>who have not taken any further action, although they </p><p>perceive this as an attempt to strong-arm money and gain </p><p>influence within the not-for-profit organization. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Save Conservancy is a 321,355 hectare project which is </p><p>jointly owned by twenty-three landowners (including an </p><p>Amcit) who have dedicated their properties to wildlife </p><p>production and management.  Each property owner retains </p><p>separate ownership, and each is allocated separate hunting </p><p>quotas, although all internal fences have been removed in </p><p>order to facilitate the free movement of animals between the </p><p>properties.  Several of the constituent farms have been </p><p>heavily invaded by settlers, and several have received </p><p>either preliminary or final notices of GOZ acquisition under </p><p>the Land Resettlement Program.  War veterans and other </p><p>occupiers have declared at least five of the occupied </p><p>properties along the outside borders "no-go" areas, and </p><p>conservancy managers and game scouts cannot even estimate </p><p>the losses on those properties.  The entire western game </p><p>fence -- in excess of 80 km of fence, comprising 1280 km of </p><p>wire -- has been cut down and transformed into wire snares, </p><p>which now permeate parts of the conservancy.  Conservancy </p><p>managers have documented the impact of occupation through </p><p>overflight game counts and settler/hut/domestic animal </p><p>counts, and have confirmed the inverse relationship between </p><p>settler presence and wildlife presence, with almost no </p><p>wildlife visible on the "no-go" farms.  Since August 2001, </p><p>Save monitors have documented several thousand animals </p><p>poached, over twenty thousand snares recovered, hundreds of </p><p>poachers\' dogs shot, and over a thousand poachers arrested - </p><p>- without even taking into account the most heavily </p><p>"settled" farms.  Characteristically, the largest animals -- </p><p>elephant, buffalo, and rhino -- have been the least </p><p>affected, while the "meat" animals -- impala, kudu, eland, </p><p>warthog, wildebeest, zebra, and other small animals -- have </p><p>been the most heavily poached. </p><p> </p><p>18.  It is interesting to note that the GOZ has consistently </p><p>promised the publication of a "Wildlife-Based Plan for Land </p><p>Resettlement," supposedly addressing the claims and needs of </p><p>private conservancies, since the land invasions were first </p><p>initiated by the government in 2000.  To date, no formal </p><p>statement has been forthcoming, and private conservancies </p><p>continue to struggle against the tide of occupation, extra- </p><p>legal land grabs, and continued poaching. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  Conservationists note that natural resources are a </p><p>safety net in hard times; it seems that the current hard </p><p>times may have destroyed the resiliency of that net, at </p><p>least from the wildlife perspective.  The bitter struggle </p><p>between new land claimants and title-deed holders has left </p><p>many animal populations completely unprotected and subject </p><p>to random depredation.  While some specific segments of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s wildlife environment have been spared </p><p>devastation, the environment as a whole has suffered damage </p><p>which could take generations to repair.  It will be little </p><p>consolation to a future GOZ to possess 500 black rhino, or </p><p>100,000 elephants, if the ecology is so damaged that the </p><p>land cannot sustain them.  Tourism is one of the engines </p><p>which could pull Zimbabwe out of an economic morass -- but </p><p>only if Zimbabwe retains attractions and infrastructure </p><p>sufficient to catch the attention of tourists.  Continued </p><p>destruction of wildlife resources could cause severe delays </p><p>in the eventual recovery of the tourism sector. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
