"Hurriyet" </p><p>reports that Prime Minister Erdogan, Chief of General Staff </p><p>General Ozkok, Interior Minister Aksu, Defense Minister </p><p>Gonul, Foreign Minister Gul, FM Under Secretary Ziyal, and </p><p>Intelligence Undersecretary Atasagun attended the two-hour </p><p>meeting.  In a written statement released after the meeting, </p><p>officials said they had made preliminary assessments about </p><p>Iraq.  "Milliyet" reports that officials agreed in principle </p><p>at the meeting that a new motion is needed for troop </p><p>deployment in Iraq.  Parliament is expected to convene in an </p><p>extraordinary session in September to address the troop </p><p>issue.  The motion will be presented to the Parliament as a </p><p>way `to contribute to Iraq\'s peace and stability.\'  "Zaman" </p><p>reports that officials analyzed the political and military </p><p>risks of a possible deployment.  All participants agreed </p><p>that Turkey cannot send troops to Iraq while Northern Iraq </p><p>remains a threat to Turkish security.  According to "Zaman," </p><p>Turkey will lay down five conditions for the sending of </p><p>Turkish troops: Turkey will not be involved only in security </p><p>matters but in political issues and the reconstruction of </p><p>Iraq as well; Turkey will not send troops to Iraq before the </p><p>PKK/KADEK threat in Northern Iraq is eliminated by the US; </p><p>Turkey must convince regional and EU countries to support </p><p>the deployment; an invitation is needed from members of the </p><p>interim Iraqi Council including Barzani and Talabani; </p><p>finally, the US must meet the expenses of the Turkish </p><p>deployment.  While "Hurriyet" and "Milliyet" report that </p><p>Turkey will send troops to Iraq, "Radikal" remains cautious, </p><p>arguing that Ankara will insist on a UN decision first. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economic News: Turkey\'s papers continue to report on </p><p>positive developments in the financial markets.  Economy </p><p>Minister Babacan said that there are `no obstacles\' standing </p><p>in the way of the $8.5 billion credit freom the US.  A </p><p>Turkish delegation will go to Washington August 18 to </p><p>determine the conditions for the loans.\'  Babacan added that </p><p>the credit was not vital for Turkey, but noted that it would </p><p>ease pressure on interest rates.  "Yeni Safak" reports that </p><p>within one week interest rates on Treasury Bond has declined </p><p>by 4.5 points.  Now it is expected that the Central Bank </p><p>will respond to the positive mood in the markets by making </p><p>further cuts in interest rates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Uzan Family:  Today\'s papers report on a Swiss court </p><p>decision to freeze the Uzans\' $800 million in assets held by </p><p>Swiss Banks.  Papers note that the decision came as a second </p><p>blow to the Uzans, following a US court ruling against the </p><p>family earlier this week.  Genc Party Leader Cem Uzan </p><p>cancelled a planned meeting with party leaders, and the </p><p>Isparta Genc Party provincial chairman and 62 party members </p><p>resigned from the Party  "Vatan" reports that the Uzans\' </p><p>application to the Swiss Court revealed that the family had </p><p>transferred much of its wealth abroad.  The Uzans have $800 </p><p>million in assets in Switzerland and $125 million in the US </p><p>and Britain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A new Vietnam syndrome" </p><p>Zafer Atay commented in the economic-political Dunya (8/6): </p><p>"The current situation in Iraq for the US is reminiscent of </p><p>the `Vietnam syndrome\' in the 1960s.  Yet the problems in </p><p>Vietnam began after some years of a US presence there.  In </p><p>Iraq, the problems started immediately after the US </p><p>operation. . The initial planning for a post-war Iraq does </p><p>not seem to be working.  The US was hoping to see a smooth </p><p>transition period after the war, but now must deal with </p><p>attacks against American soldiers. . It is interesting to </p><p>read the comments of US soldiers serving in Iraq, who openly </p><p>argue with the reasons for their presence there. The US is </p><p>seeking military support from its allies, but has yet to </p><p>receive an answer.  In the meantime, families in the US are </p><p>marching to protest the loss of lives.  Moreover, the war </p><p>budget for Iraq has become inadequate as monthly spending </p><p>has jumped to 4 billion dollars.  These are all signals that </p><p>the Vietnam syndrome has returned for the US." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sending Turkish troops to Iraq" </p><p>Kamuran Ozbir noted in the nationalist Ortadogu (8/6): </p><p>"Before discussing whether or not to send Turkish troops to </p><p>Iraq, we better analyze the situation there.  The Iraq case </p><p>has proven the argument that the establishment of peace is </p><p>more difficult than winning a war.  Washington has found </p><p>itself in a serious deadlock, and the foreseeable future </p><p>does not give much hope for democracy, peace, and stability. </p><p>Under these circumstances, Turkey should not be in a hurry </p><p>to send its troops to Iraq.  The decision process should </p><p>weigh all the pros and cons.  Moreover, the US does not seem </p><p>to be pushing Turkey for a quick decision." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
