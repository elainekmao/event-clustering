<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001530 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL UPHOLDS BAR AGAINST RIOS MONTT </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1479 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) By a three to two vote on June 12 the Supreme </p><p>Electoral Tribunal (TSE) upheld a ruling from the Registry of </p><p>Citizens (reported RefTel) barring President of Congress </p><p>Efrain Rios Montt from running for president.  The ruling was </p><p>based on Article 186 (a) of the Constitution.  Rios Montt has </p><p>announced he will appeal this ruling to the TSE, and if </p><p>reaffirmed, to the Supreme Court.  Constitutional experts </p><p>estimate that the full appeal process including the Supreme </p><p>and Constitutional Courts could take at least another month </p><p>to complete. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Before announcing the ruling, TSE President Oscar </p><p>Bolanos privately expressed concern to us about recent </p><p>threats to his family\'s security.  He received a call on the </p><p>eve of the ruling detailing all of his daughter\'s movements </p><p>the day before.  The Ambassador called Bolanos to express </p><p>concern over the threats Bolanos has been receiving, and to </p><p>tell him that we expedited a visa for Bolanos\' daughter to </p><p>travel to the U.S. on June 12. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In another electoral development, Romeo Alvarado </p><p>Polanco, one of five Constitutional Court magistrates who </p><p>will ultimately have to rule on Rios Montt\'s eligibility to </p><p>run, resigned on June 12.  Alvarado had been appointed to the </p><p>court by President Portillo and had voted in favor of several </p><p>resolutions favoring views of the governing Guatemalan </p><p>Republican Front (FRG), including the GOG\'s controversial </p><p>Euro-bond issue.  The President has constitutional authority </p><p>to name a replacement for Alvarado.  The other four </p><p>Constitutional Court justices were selected by the Supreme </p><p>Court, Congress, the High Council of the University of San </p><p>Carlos, and the Bar Association, respectively. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The TSE ruling bolsters the rule of law and took </p><p>courage.  The desertion from the Constitutional Court appears </p><p>to reflect the opposite.  His sudden departure will be read </p><p>by most observers as indicating that pressure and threats, </p><p>like those received by Bolanos, are starting to weigh on all </p><p>those who have to decide this controversial case. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
