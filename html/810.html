DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON </p><p>THE BALKANS PEACE AGREEMENT AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION.  PAVLETIC SAID THAT THE AGREEMENT OFFERS </p><p>THE BASIS FOR ALL THREE ETHNIC GROUPS TO RESOLVE THEIR </p><p>DIFFERENCES.  BECAUSE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO PEACE </p><p>WITHOUT THE U.S. INITIATIVE, PAVLETIC STRESSED THAT IT IS </p><p>VITAL FOR CONTINUED U.S. ASSISTANCE IN IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THERE IS MUCH UNFINISHED </p><p>BUSINESS, INCLUDING CREATING A CIVIL SOCIETY, THE RETURN </p><p>OF A MULTI-ETHNIC SOCIETY, AND A RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM </p><p>OF THOSE WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED </p><p>THAT PEACE WILL NOT BE REAL AND HEALING CANNOT BEGIN UNTIL </p><p>A FINAL ACCOUNTING IS DONE AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR </p><p>CRIMES -- ON ALL SIDES -- HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.0N DECEMBER 14 AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH PAID A COURTESY </p><p>CALL ON THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>VLATKO PAVLETIC (CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION -- HDZ). </p><p>PAVLETIC FOCUSED HIS COMMENTS ON THE SIGNING OF THE </p><p>BALKANS PEACE AGREEMENT IN PARIS AND NOTED THAT, AS </p><p>DIFFICULT AS THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS WAS, IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>WILL BE HARDER.  HE SAID THAT THE CRUEL WAR OF THE LAST </p><p>FIVE YEARS HAS BROUGHT A PEACE THAT THAT IS ALMOST AS </p><p>CRUEL TO ITS VICTIMS.  HE LAMENTED THAT WHILE THE VIOLENCE </p><p>HAS ENDED, HATRED AND INTOLERANCE PERSIST.  A DIFFICULT </p><p>JOB LIES AHEAD TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR CROATS, SERBS, </p><p>AND MUSLIMS TO LIVE TOGETHER AGAIN.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT FINDING A FORMULA TO BUILD TRUST WILL BE MORE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  05177  01 OF 02  181254Z </p><p>DIFFICULT THAN FINDING THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO REBUILD </p><p>VUKOVAR. </p><p> </p><p>3.PAVLETIC ADDED THAT THE PEACE AGREEMENT OFFERS THE </p><p>BASIS FOR ALL THREE ETHNIC GROUPS TO RESOLVE THEIR </p><p>DIFFERENCES.  HOWEVER, THE ENTIRE FORMULA COULD PROVE </p><p>UNWORKABLE IF ONE PARTY VIOLATES IT.  HE SAID THIS WAS A </p><p>SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO LEADERS IN SECTOR EAST WHO HAVE </p><p>PUBLICLY INTERPRETED THE AGREEMENT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE </p><p>GOC (NOTE: LEADERS IN EASTERN SLAVONIA HAVE SAID THAT </p><p>CROATIAN DISPLACED PERSONS WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED TO RETURN </p><p>WHEN SERBS BEGIN TO COME BACK TO FORMER SECTORS NORTH AND </p><p>SOUTH).  PAVLETIC WARNED THAT IF SUCH ATTITUDES PERSIST, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AND HDZ WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN </p><p>CONTINUED PUBLIC OR PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>AGREEMENT.  (PAVLETIC ALSO UNDERLINED THAT THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES\' WERE SEEKING AN IDEAL SOLUTION AND SAID THAT ONLY </p><p>THE HDZ, WITH A REALISTIC VIEW OF THE PROBLEM AT HAND, </p><p>CARRIED THE VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE AGREEMENT.)  EVEN WITHOUT </p><p>THE UNHELPFUL STANCE OF SOME EASTERN SLAVONIAN LEADERS, </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION WILL NOT BE EASY OR SWIFT.  THERE COULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN NO PEACE WITHOUT THE U.S. INITIATIVE AND BECAUSE </p><p>OF ITS INFLUENCE, PAVLETIC STRESSED, IT IS VITAL FOR </p><p>CONTINUED U.S. ASSISTANCE IN IMPLEMENTATION.  PAVLETIC </p><p>SAID IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO REINTRODUCE LAW AND ORDER, </p><p>SINCE FORMER INSTITUTIONS HAVE VANISHED WITH THE MASS </p><p>MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND LOSS OF PROPERTY. </p><p> </p><p>4.THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THERE IS MUCH UNFINISHED </p><p>BUSINESS, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT, </p><p>CREATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY, THE RETURN OF MULTI-ETHNIC </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  05177  01 OF 02  181254Z </p><p>SOCIETY, AND A RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO HAVE </p><p>DISAPPEARED.  HE STRESSED THAT PEACE WILL NOT BE REAL AND </p><p>HEALING CANNOT BEGIN UNTIL A FINAL ACCOUNTING IS DONE AND </p><p>THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR CRIMES -- ON ALL SIDES -- HAVE </p><p>BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  THE AMBASSADOR THANKE </p><p>D PAVLETIC </p><p>FOR HIS SUPPORT OF THE DAYTON AGREEMENT AND SAID THAT </p><p>WHILE IT DID NOT GIVE CROATIA EVERYTHING IT WANTED, </p><p>CROATIA MET MORE OF ITS GOALS THAN THE OTHER PARTIES IN </p><p>THE CONFLICT.  THE AGREEMENT GUARANTEES CROATIA\'S </p><p>TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY WITHIN ITS INTERNATIONALLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED BORDERS AND, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BOSANSKA </p><p>POSAVINA, ALMOST ALL BOSNIAN CROATS LIVE IN THE </p><p>FEDERATION.  HE NOTED THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE AN </p><p>AGREEMENT THAT FULLY SATISFIES ONE SIDE, THAT PEACE </p><p>REQUIRES COMPROMISES. EVEN THOUGH THE CROATS OF BOSANSKA </p><p>POSAVINA ARE NOT IN THE FEDERATION, THEY STILL HAVE THE </p><p>RIGHT TO RETURN, RECOVER PROPERTY, AND VOTE.  BY VOTING </p><p>THEY COULD CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THE SERB ENTITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.
