<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 008150 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EB/IFD/ODF, SA/AR, SA/PAB AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EAID, PREL, AF, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON TURKEY\'S CONTRIBUTION TO AFGHANISTAN </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 7410 </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 200660 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  EmbOffs met with MFA\'s Afghan Reconstruction Coordinator </p><p>Ambassador Refat Okcun 11/12 for an update on Turkey\'s </p><p>reconstruction efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Okcun confirmed that Turkey\'s completed reconstruction </p><p>efforts now total $1.8 million, up from $1.6 reported Ref A. </p><p>By year\'s end, that figure should reach $2.5 million, well </p><p>ahead of Turkey\'s pledge of $5 million over five years. </p><p>Okcun holds another $4.5 million aside, should he be unable </p><p>to drum up outside sources that keep Turkey apace or ahead of </p><p>its projected giving schedule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  A number of projects are in Healthcare.  Turkey is about </p><p>to build its fourth hospital in Afghanistan (including </p><p>Kabul\'s Children\'s Hospital, which Turkey built in 1980) and </p><p>is seeking approval for a clinic in Bamiyan.  The Bamiyan </p><p>clinic will increase the number of Turkish healthcare </p><p>facilities to nine, including ones in Herat, Jalalabad and </p><p>Kandahar.  The Turks also continue to train medical </p><p>professionals (another 41 doctors just trained in Turkey) and </p><p>will send three teams of three Turkish physicians each (a </p><p>surgeon, an internal medicine specialist, an ob/gyn) to </p><p>Afghanistan soon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Turkey is considering diverting one of its two satellites </p><p>towards Afghanistan to provide a television signal that can </p><p>bring information, news, educational and other programming to </p><p>Afghans.  No decision has been made yet on how to transmit </p><p>the signal on the ground -- via local transmitting stations </p><p>or through the purchase of individual dishes.  In any case, </p><p>television programming will have to wait until electrical </p><p>power becomes more universally available. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
