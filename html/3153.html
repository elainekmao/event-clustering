<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001448 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI, MDC, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT, RUNNING SCARED, RENEWS </p><p>CRACKDOWN ON MDC </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Todd Faulk for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: In the last week, the Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>(GOZ) has renewed its crackdown on the opposition Movement </p><p>for Democratic Change (MDC), which is still considering some </p><p>sort of mass action to force the GOZ to rerun the flawed </p><p>March presidential election.  Police have arrested hundreds </p><p>of MDC supporters and activists in Manicaland following an </p><p>attempted MDC rally in Mutare, and police beat up and </p><p>arrested more than 80 MDC members attempting to hold a public </p><p>meeting in Harare on June 16.  The Harare detainees, </p><p>including an MDC Member of Parliament, have spent a second </p><p>night in jail and police denied medical attention to six who </p><p>were seriously injured in the beatings.  Police also set up </p><p>large-scale roadblocks around the capital on June 17 in an </p><p>attempt to deter further political gatherings.  The GOZ is </p><p>running scared, knowing that it is bankrupt of new ideas to </p><p>stop the country\'s precipitous economic slide, and the </p><p>citizenry is increasingly hungry and impatient. </p><p>Consequently, the GOZ is increasingly reliant on repression </p><p>and the security forces to prevent popular protest from </p><p>taking hold.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Crackdown in Manicaland </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Over the last several weeks, the opposition MDC has </p><p>been exploring ways to mobilize some sort of mass action </p><p>against the GOZ, whether it be a limited stay-away or </p><p>large-scale demonstrations.  Even though the MDC National </p><p>Executive decided June 9 that it was not yet ready to </p><p>undertake a nationwide mass action, MDC President Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai may nonetheless be testing the waters for a mass </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>action by gauging the reaction of the GOZ and the public.  On </p><p>June 12, riot police and ax-wielding ZANU-PF youth occupied </p><p>the venue for an MDC rally in Mutare South that Tsvangirai </p><p>was due to address, and prevented any gathering from taking </p><p>place, according to the June 13 edition of the independent </p><p>"Daily News."  Learnmore Jongwe, MDC Secretary for Public </p><p>Information and a National Executive member, told poloff June </p><p>18 that 100 MDC members were arrested in Chibunji, in </p><p>southern Manicaland, after MDC supporters allegedly burned </p><p>down a bottle store on June 10 belonging to Bernard Makuwe. </p><p>Makuwe, the ZANU-PF chairman for Buhera, was named as a </p><p>defendant in the petrol-bomb murder of Tsvangirai\'s driver </p><p>and another MDC member in April 2000, but has so far refused </p><p>without consequences to appear in court.  Jongwe also told </p><p>poloff that the last 138 of the 170 MDC supporters who were </p><p>beaten up and arrested on June 12 in the town of Birchenough </p><p>Bridge, were released on bail.  They were arrested after </p><p>holding a public meeting in the town.  These actions followed </p><p>a police raid on MDC headquarters in Mutare and the Mutare </p><p>offices of two prominent MDC MPs on May 31.  The police, </p><p>claiming to be looking for plans or weapons to "oust the </p><p>government or force a rerun of the presidential election," </p><p>went away with nothing. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Crackdown Extends to Harare </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On June 16, about 85 MDC members and supporters </p><p>attempted to meet in Harare Gardens, the extensive park </p><p>across the street from the U.S. Embassy.  The police quickly </p><p>got wind of their activities, and descended on the gathering. </p><p> They told the leaders that the park was not suitable for </p><p>such a meeting, ordered them to disperse, and attacked those </p><p>gathered with truncheons.  According to Jongwe, they </p><p>attempted to regroup at the MDC\'s Harare provincial </p><p>headquarters downtown, but were thwarted there as well. </p><p>Police continued to beat people, including MDC MP for </p><p>Highfield Munyaradzi Gwisai and a "Daily News" reporter, and </p><p>a total of about 80 were taken into custody.  Jongwe reported </p><p>that when Gwisai\'s attorney saw him in jail, Gwisai was </p><p>bleeding profusely and may have had a broken rib.  A doctor </p><p>who examined the detainees the night of June 16 said that six </p><p>of them, including Gwisai, required hospitalization, but </p><p>police refused to release them, according to the June 18 </p><p>"Daily News."  The detainees were held a second night June </p><p>17, but were due to appear in court on June 18.  Alarmed by </p><p>the attempted gathering in Harare, police erected large-scale </p><p>roadblocks on major thoroughfares leading into central Harare </p><p>on the morning of June 17.  Unlike with previous roadblocks, </p><p>where police would wave most vehicles through, nearly every </p><p>vehicle was stopped and nearly every driver questioned, which </p><p>led to unprecedented backups and traffic snarls in the </p><p>morning rush-hour.  Police confirmed to us that preventing </p><p>civil protest was the objective of the roadblocks.  As of </p><p>June 18, roadblocks remained in place, but vehicles were </p><p>being stopped less frequently. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Comment: GOZ is Running Scared </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Given the police\'s swift and heavy-handed reaction to </p><p>attempted, small-scale gatherings in Manicaland and Harare, </p><p>the GOZ is clearly becoming more concerned about some kind of </p><p>MDC-sponsored mass action, the National Executive\'s earlier </p><p>decision notwithstanding.  The GOZ is using all of the means </p><p>at its disposal to head-off and disrupt any kind of gathering </p><p>lest it erupt into a demonstration or riot that might spark a </p><p>larger uprising.  Mugabe and his backers evidently believed </p><p>that after the flawed presidential election, they could go </p><p>back to business as usual; instead things have only gotten </p><p>worse.  They may be starting to realize that the economic </p><p>slide, with spiraling inflation, dried-up forex flows, and </p><p>growing food shortages, has become so acute that even if </p><p>ZANU-PF was willing to reverse its damaging policies now, it </p><p>would not be enough to prevent widespread hunger and </p><p>continued economic decline.  Combined with deep pools of </p><p>disillusionment and anger, the hunger could become a </p><p>dangerous catalyst for an explosion that the GOZ might have </p><p>difficulty controlling.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
