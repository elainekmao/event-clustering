<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001167 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WGSARS, OES/PCI, WHA/CAN (RUNNING) </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, OFFICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (STEIGER) </p><p> </p><p>CDC for Global Health Office (Cox) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, AMED, CA, SARS, Health </p><p>SUBJECT: WGSARS: Canada-wide Status Report April 25 </p><p>(Number 7) </p><p> </p><p>Ref. (A) Ottawa 1155 (SARS Canada-wide Report #6) </p><p> </p><p>     (B) Toronto 1210(Ontario SARS Update #17) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. Health Canada provides domestic travel advisory with </p><p>the message: "It\'s safe to come to Toronto"; federal </p><p>cabinet to meet in Toronto on April 29 to lead by </p><p>example.  Total cases in Ontario continue to drop, but </p><p>there has been an increase in suspect cases in British </p><p>Columbia.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Domestic Travel Advisory </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. In an unprecedented step, on April 25, Health Canada </p><p>issued a domestic travel advisory regarding SARS and </p><p>Toronto.  The text reads "Health Canada advises </p><p>Canadians that travel to any destination in Canada is </p><p>safe and may be undertaken in the same manner as one </p><p>usually would with respect to transport, accommodation, </p><p>meals, entertainment, business and family engagements, </p><p>whether arriving from overseas or traveling </p><p>domestically". </p><p> </p><p>3. Health Canada does not normally issue travel advice </p><p>with respect to domestic travel.  Canadian Health </p><p>authorities believe, however, that this domestic travel </p><p>advice will provide Canadians with the most accurate </p><p>assessment of the Canadian SARS situation.  The Travel </p><p>Advice can be accessed at: </p><p> </p><p>http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/tmp- </p><p>pmv/2003/sarsdomestic_e.html </p><p> </p><p>4. For the first time since the WHO Travel Advisory was </p><p>released, Prime Minister Chrtien made remarks on SARS. </p><p>In his April 25 remarks in Ottawa at a Genome Science </p><p>exposition, Chrtien noted that Canada is working in </p><p>close partnership with the United States Centers for </p><p>Disease Control and that Canada is very appreciative of </p><p>the CDC effort. </p><p> </p><p>5. He noted too, the fact that the GoC believes that </p><p>the World Health Organization came to the wrong </p><p>conclusion and that Toronto is a safe city.  Chretien </p><p>announced a "marketing campaign for Toronto and Ontario </p><p>and indeed all of Canada" to demonstrate there is no </p><p>threat.  The GoC will contribute C$10 million to the </p><p>effort. </p><p> </p><p>6. Moreover, the federal cabinet will meet in Toronto </p><p>on April 29 to demonstrate in a very public way the GoC </p><p>commitment to not let fears about SARS prevail.  The PM </p><p>will also stay Monday night at a Toronto hotel. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>SARS Figures </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. As of 13:00 Eastern Daylight Saving Time, April 24, </p><p>2003 Health Canada has received reports of 327 probable </p><p>or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome </p><p>(SARS) in Canada (A net increase Canada-wide of 1 case </p><p>since our Report #6).  There have been 16 deaths </p><p>attributed to SARS linked to the Toronto nexus.  To </p><p>date, transmission has been limited to specific </p><p>transmission settings such as households, hospitals and </p><p>specific community settings. The details of the cases </p><p>to date are as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-- Ontario is reporting 136 probable and 121 suspect </p><p>cases.  This is a decrease of 1 suspect case since </p><p>Report #6.  (See Toronto reporting for greater detail.) </p><p> </p><p>-- British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 54 </p><p>suspect cases. This is an increase of 7 suspect cases </p><p>since Report #6.  See paragraph 4. </p><p> </p><p>-- New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases. (No </p><p>change.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case. (No </p><p>change.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases. (No change) </p><p>-- Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases. </p><p>(No change.) </p><p> </p><p>8. The new suspect cases in British Columbia (BC) were </p><p>passengers on the flight from New Delhi via Taipei that </p><p>arrived in Vancouver on April 19.  In an April 24 press </p><p>release Dr. Monika Naus of the BC Centre for Disease </p><p>Control noted that  "There are many causes for fever </p><p>and cough in a returning traveler, India is not </p><p>considered a SARS-affected area by the World Health </p><p>Organization and there was only a brief stopover in </p><p>Taipei. The risk may be low that these individuals have </p><p>SARS, but we don\'t want to take any chances. If there </p><p>are other passengers who were on this flight who are </p><p>ill, we want to know about it." </p><p> </p><p>9. In the press release Naus states "We have been </p><p>notified of 10 people in eight different families who </p><p>have reported these symptoms.  Two have been </p><p>hospitalized (Ref A) but none have required ICU care or </p><p>assistance to breathe."  "We are asking that any other </p><p>passengers with flu-like illness who were on these </p><p>flights call ahead and notify their personal doctor. </p><p>Their doctor should then notify public health." </p><p> </p><p>10.  The BC Centre for Disease Control will be directly </p><p>contacting residents of B.C. who were on the China Air </p><p>flight.  Passengers who may have gone on to other </p><p>provinces will be notified by that province. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
