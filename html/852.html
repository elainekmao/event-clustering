<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L JERUSALEM 003094 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEA FOR VERSTANDIG; SMEC FOR ROSS; INR FOR ENSLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DNG:  11/08/06 </p><p>TAGS: KPAL, KWBG, KISL, PTER </p><p>SUBJECT: HAMAS BIDING ITS TIME </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY CONSUL GENERAL EDWARD G. ABINGTON, JR.  REASON </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BIR ZEIT UNIVERSITY POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR HISHAM </p><p>AHMAD TOLD POLOFF THAT HAMAS IS LAYING LOW FOLLOWING CRACKDOWNS BY </p><p>THE PA AND ISRAELI SECURITY AFTER TERRORIST ATTACKS EARLIER THIS </p><p>YEAR.  IN HIS VIEW, HAMAS IS CURRENTLY BIDING ITS TIME AND WAITING </p><p>FOR THE STREET TO BECOME FRUSTATED ENOUGH WITH THE CLOSURE AND LACK </p><p>OF PROGRESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS TO, IF NOT WELCOME A RESUMPTION OF </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS, AT LEAST "SYMPATHIZE" WITH THEM.  AHMAD BELIEVES </p><p>A "HARDCORE" OF HAMAS OPERATIVES AND PLANNERS REMAIN TO GUIDE </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO RECRUIT MEMBERS, </p><p>DESPITE DAMAGE DONE TO ITS INFRASTRUCTURE DURING EARLIER </p><p>CRACKDOWNS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>HAMAS LAYING LOW FOR NOW.... </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) POLOFF MET WITH DR. HISHAM AHMAD, AN AMCIT BIR ZEIT </p><p>POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR, TO DISCUSS WEST BANK POLITICAL </p><p>OPPOSITION GROUPS.  (NOTE: AHMAD IS THE AUTHOR OF THE 1994 PASSIA </p><p>STUDY ON HAMAS ENTITLED "HAMAS: FROM RELIGIOUS SALVATION TO </p><p>POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION: THE RISE OF HAMAS IN PALESTINIAN </p><p>SOCIETY").  AHMAD TOLD POLOFF THAT HAMAS\' LACK OF ACTIVISM DURING </p><p>THE LATE SEPTEMBER ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CLASHES INDICATED ITS </p><p>CURRENT STRATEGY OF LAYING LOW AND WAITING FOR POPULAR FRUSTRATION </p><p>TO BUILD AS A NATURAL OUTGROWTH OF EVENTS ON THE GROUND.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT HAMAS IS CONDUCTING ITS ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS RECRUITING AND </p><p>MOBILIZING MEMBERS AND RUNNING ITS SOCIAL-WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS IN </p><p>THE WEST BANK, IN A MORE LOW-KEY FASHION.  THIS IS A RESULT OF THE </p><p>PA AND ISRAELI CRACKDOWNS ON ITS ORGANIZATION FOLLOWING SUICIDE </p><p>BOMB ATTACKS EARLIER THIS YEAR AS WELL AS TO AVOID HARASSMENT FROM </p><p>THE PA.  AHMAD OPINED THAT HAMAS CURRENTLY SEES NO NEED TO WHIP UP </p><p>THE STREET BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY FRUSTRATED AND ON EDGE.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS IS A TIME-HONORED TACTIC THAT HAMAS USES - TO LET THE PLO OR </p><p>ISRAEL MAKE MISSTEPS OR CREATE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND THAT </p><p>FACILITATE HAMAS\'S GOAL OF DISCREDITING THE PA AND THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>...BUT STILL A LURKING THREAT OF TERRORISM </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (C) AHMAD SAID THAT HE IS CONCERNED THAT HAMAS\'S RELATIVE QUIET </p><p>IS ONLY TEMPORARY AND THAT IT WILL RESUME ATTACKS AS POPULAR </p><p>FRUSTRATION OVER LACK OF MOVEMENT IN THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE </p><p>NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT\'S POLICIES CONTINUE TO BUILD.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>HAMAS TERRORIST OPERATIVES LEARNED THEIR LESSON FROM THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PUBLIC\'S CONDEMNATION OF ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS IN 1995 </p><p>AND EARLY 1996 AND THE RESULTING HARDSHIP VISITED UPON THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS THROUGH TIGHTENED ECONOMIC CLOSURES; THEIR OBJECTIVE </p><p>NOW IS TO RESUME TERRORIST ATTACKS WHEN POPULAR FRUSTRATION BECOMES </p><p>GREAT ENOUGH SO THAT THE PUBLIC WILL NOT CONDEMN SUCH A RESUMPTION. </p><p>HE SAID THERE IS A "HARDCORE" OF HAMAS TERRORIST PLANNERS AND </p><p>OPERATIVES IN PLACE.  (NOTE: LIKE OTHER CONGEN CONTACTS, AHMAD </p><p>COULD NOT QUANTIFY OR SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THIS "CRITICAL MASS" OF </p><p>PUBLIC DISCONTENT). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>EFFECTS OF CLOSURE AND CRACKDOWNS ON HAMAS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>5.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO POLOFF\'S QUESTIONS, AHMAD SAID THAT HAMAS IS </p><p>CONTINUING TO RECRUIT MEMBERS, ALTHOUGH THE CRACKDOWNS IN MARCH </p><p>WEAKENED ITS INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOME HAMAS MEMBERS CRITICIZED THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S RELATIVELY LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE DURING THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER CLASHES.  IN RESPONSE TO POLOFF\'S QUESTION, AHMAD SAID </p><p>THAT THE CLOSURE IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR HAMAS: IT MAKES IT </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT FOR HAMAS OPERATIVES TO PLAN AND EXECUTE TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS, BUT THE CLOSURE AND ATTENDANT ECONOMIC HARDSHIP ARE </p><p>DECREASING PATIENCE ON THE STREET AND INCREASING FRUSTRATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AHMAD PREDICTED THAT ALLEVIATING THE SOURCES OF PALESTINIAN </p><p>FRUSTRATION WOULD "PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER HAMAS".  IF HAMAS </p><p>WERE TO STAGE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN AN IMPROVED ECONOMIC AND </p><p>POLITICAL CLIMATE, AHMAD PREDICTED THAT PUBLIC OPINION WOULD NOT </p><p>SUPPORT HAMAS-INSPIRED VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  WHILE IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DISCERN WHAT </p><p>HAMAS\'S SHADOWEY OPERATIONAL ELEMENTS ARE UP TO AND TO PREDICT </p><p>THEIR FUTURE PLANS, AHMAD\'S ANALYSIS SEEMS REASONABLE FROM OUR </p><p>POINT OF VIEW.  A PRODUCT OF THE POLITICALLY ACTIVE DHEISHEH </p><p>REFUGEE CAMP NEAR BETHLEHEM, AHMAD IS A CREDIBLE COMMENTATOR ON </p><p>HAMAS THROUGH HIS ACADEMIC BACKGROUND AND HIS CONTACTS IN THE LOCAL </p><p>COMMUNITY.  AS FRUSTRATED AS THE PALESTINIAN STREET IS, IT IS </p><p>INTERESTING THAT AHMAD DID NOT FORESEE THAT HAMAS WOULD ENJOY A </p><p>LARGE BOOST IN POPULARITY IF IT WERE TO RESUME TERRORIST ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ABINGTON </p><p></p></div>
