(U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE RICHARD ALBRIGHT FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) A/DCM conveyed reftel concerns May 21 to </p><p>UAE Central Bank Financial Intelligence Unit Chief </p><p>Abdul-Rahim Sinkais Al-Awadhi.  A/DCM noted that we </p><p>had a single, uncorroborated report that as much as </p><p>one billion USD in cash had moved into accounts </p><p>here belonging to the Al-Wasl and Babel Trading </p><p>Company.  Al-Awadhi promised to check with the </p><p>Central Bank Governor and get back to us. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  On May 25, Al-Awadhi told A/DCM that, </p><p>after consultations with the Governor, he was </p><p>authorized to state that the UAEG has no </p><p>information to support the allegation.  Large </p><p>movements of cash of the nature described would </p><p>immediately come to the attention of the Central </p><p>Bank, and would in any case be reported by the </p><p>relevant banks here to the authorities, since large </p><p>cash deposits would automatically trigger reporting </p><p>requirements.  Al-Awadhi suggested that the source </p><p>of the information was likely not familiar with the </p><p>relatively small size of the UAE financial sector, </p><p>nor the oversight of that sector exercised by </p><p>government authorities.  While hundreds of millions </p><p>of dollars might be overlooked in New York or </p><p>London, such substantial deposits into the UAE </p><p>banking system would have instant visibility. </p><p>A/DCM expressed appreciation for this information. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
