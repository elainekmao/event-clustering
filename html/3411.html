SUMMARY. ON 24 AUGUST A/ECMIN VISITED THE PRIOLO </p><p>INDUSTRIAL AREA IN SOUTHERN SICILY TO MEET WITH DOW ITALIA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03755  01 OF 02  011426Z </p><p>AND POLIMERI EUROPA, TOUR THEIR FACILITIES, AND ACQUIRE </p><p>GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMPANIES TO PAVE THE WAY FOR </p><p>FUTURE DISCUSSIONS ON EU CHEMICALS POLICY.  DOW IS THE </p><p>LARGEST CHEMICAL COMPANY OPERATING IN ITALY, AND POLIMERI </p><p>EUROPA IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF POLYETHYLENES IN EUROPE. </p><p>THE VERY DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL STRUCTURES AND STYLE OF THE </p><p>COMPANIES SUGGESTS THAT WE MAY FIND DIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE </p><p>ABOUT THE EU PROPOSALS; PE PLANTS FUNCTION AS PRODUCTION </p><p>UNITS WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF POLICY OR MANAGEMENT ISSUES, </p><p>WHEREAS DOW HAS INTEGRATED ITS PRODUCTION/RESEARCH </p><p>FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL INTO OVERALL CORPORATE MANAGEMENT. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p>2. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTION OF PRIOLO WAS BUILT AS A SINGLE, </p><p>MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPLEX IN THE 1950S BY THE GOI, THEN </p><p>PRIVATIZED IN THE EARLY 1960S. THE PRIOLO SITE, WHICH </p><p>OCCUPIES 900 HECTARES NORTH OF SYRACUSE, CONTAINS PLANTS </p><p>OWNED BY AGIP, ENICHEM, DOW, POLIMERI EUROPA, ERG, AND ESSO. </p><p>SOME OF THESE COMPANIES FUNCTION INTERDEPENDENTLY AT THE </p><p>PRIOLO SITE, TRANSPORTING PRODUCTS AND/OR INTERMEDIATES TO </p><p>OTHER COMPANIES IN THE VICINITY.  THE PRIOLO PLANTS SHARE AN </p><p>EXTENSIVE SECURITY SYSTEM AND THE SAME SHIPYARD FOR </p><p>TRANSPORTATION OF MATERIALS. IN ADDITION, THEY ALL BELONG TO </p><p>CIPA, THE INDUSTRIAL CONSORTIUM FOR ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>PROTECTION, AND SHARE A COMMON BIOLOGICAL PLANT FOR </p><p>TREATMENT OF WASTEWATER (IAS), WHICH IS THE LARGEST OF ITS </p><p>KIND IN EUROPE AND THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD.  IAS\'S </p><p>CURRENT GOAL IS TO RECYCLE THREE MILLION CUBIC METERS OF </p><p>WASTEWATER FROM INDUSTRY; ITS FUTURE GOAL WILL BE TEN </p><p>MILLION CUBIC METERS. </p><p> </p><p>3. A/ECMIN FIRST MET WITH POLIMERI EUROPA (PE) PERSONNEL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03755  01 OF 02  011426Z </p><p>FROM PRIOLO. PE, BASED IN MILAN, PRODUCES TWENTY DIFFERENT </p><p>LOW-DENSITY LINEAR POLYETHYLENE (LDLPE) PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS </p><p>PROPYLENE, CUMENE, AND AROMATICS SUCH AS BENZENE, ORTHO- AND </p><p>PARA- XYLENE, AND TOLUENE.  PE HAS TWO OTHER SICILIAN PLANTS </p><p>AT GELA AND RAGUSA; BOTH PRODUCE LDLPES, AND GELA ALSO </p><p>PRODUCES SMALL AMOUNTS OF ETHYLENE AND PROPYLENE. THE PRIOLO </p><p>FACILITY IS THE LARGEST OF THE THREE IN TERMS OF BOTH SIZE </p><p>AND OUTPUT, OCCUPYING THREE MILLION SQUARE METERS OF LAND </p><p>AND PRODUCING 745 KILOTONS OF ETHYLENE, 440 KTN OF </p><p>PROPYLENE, 440 KTN OF BENZENE, AND 200 KTN OF LDLPE PER </p><p>YEAR. IT HAS 565 EMPLOYEES AND A STORAGE CAPACITY OF 98,000 </p><p>CUBIC METERS.  THE AROMATICS PLANT WAS INSTALLED FROM 1964- </p><p>1971, AND THE CRACKING PLANT IN 1981.  THE EQUIPMENT IN THE </p><p>ETHYLENE PLANT, WHERE PE IS GRADUALLY EMPLOYING MORE </p><p>ADVANCED COMPUTERIZED CONTROLS AND MONITORING SYSTEMS, WAS </p><p>INSTALLED IN 1987.  THERE IS NO PE RESEARCH UNIT AT THE </p><p>PRIOLO SITE; RESEARCH INTO AROMATICS AND CRACKING TAKES </p><p>PLACE AT A MILAN FUNCTIONARY. </p><p> </p><p>4. PE RECEIVES MONOMERIC ETHYLENE AND PROPYLENE FROM ENICHEM </p><p>PRIOLO, WHICH CAN THEN BE SUBJECTED TO VINYL POLIMERIZATION/ </p><p>ZIEGLER-NATTA CATALYSIS, CREATING A STRONG LINEAR </p><p>POLYETHYLENE.  PE ALSO RECEIVES AROMATIC C-6 FRACTIONS FROM </p><p>ERG, HYDROGEN FUEL GAS FROM ESSO PRIOLO, AND TRANSPORTS </p><p>MONOMERIC ETHYLENE AND AMMONIA VIA PIPELINE TO THE PLANTS AT </p><p>GELA AND RAGUSA. </p><p> </p><p>5. A/ECMIN JOINED NAPLES CONGEN CLYDE BISHOP AT THE DOW </p><p>ITALIA POLYURETHANES SITE TO MEET WITH DOW PERSONNEL FROM </p><p>PRIOLO AND MANAGEMENT FROM DOW\'S MILAN HEADQUARTERS. THIS </p><p>PARTICULAR PLANT WAS ACQUIRED FROM ENICHEM\'S POLYURETHANES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03755  01 OF 02  011426Z </p><p>DIVISION IN 2001, WHICH HAD ACQUIRED IT FROM UNION CARBIDE </p><p>IN 1990.  AT THIS TIME, DOW ALSO ACQUIRED OTHER ENICHEM </p><p>POLYURETHANES PLANTS, ALL EQUIPPED WITH RESEARCH FACILITIES, </p><p>IN BRINDISI, PORTO MARGHERA (NEAR VENICE), AND TERTRO, </p><p>BELGIUM.  WITH THESE ACQUISITIONS, DOW IS NOW THE LARGEST </p><p>CHEMICAL COMPANY OPERATING IN ITALY.  THE PRIOLO SITE\'S </p><p>PRINCIPAL MARKETS LIE IN NORTH AFRICA, TURKEY, AND ITALY. </p><p>THE PLANT, WHICH HAS 97 EMPLOYEES, PRODUCES ETHYL OXIDES </p><p>(ETHERS), GLYCOLS, POLYGLYCOLS, AND POLYOLS.  THESE PRODUCTS </p><p>ARE USED FOR COOLING FLUIDS, PHARMACEUTICALS, OIL FIELDS, </p><p>COATINGS, AGRICULTURE, SHOE SOLES, AND AS RAW MATERIALS FOR </p><p>POLYURETHANE SYNTHESIS.  WHEN MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT FROM </p><p>DOW MILAN, A/ECMIN SUGGESTED DISCUSSION OF SUSTAINABLE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IN ADDITION TO PREVIOUS PLANS FOR A SEPTEMBER </p><p>MEETING ON EU CHEMICALS POLICY.  DOW MILAN SEEMED EAGER AND </p><p>PREPARED TO DISCUSS AT A LATER DATE. </p><p> </p><p>6. COMMENT: A/ECMIN PLANS TO USE THESE SITE VISITS AS </p><p>STARTING POINTS FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EU CHEMICALS WHITE </p><p>PAPER AND DERIVATIVE TEXTS.

POLIMERI </p><p>EUROPA PRIOLO IS A PRODUCTION UNIT THAT RECEIVES </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS FROM ITS MILAN HEADQUARTERS.  THEIR HQ DOES NOT </p><p>CONSULT REGULARLY WITH PRODUCTION LEADERS, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03755  02 OF 02  011426Z </p><p>AND THE PLANT </p><p>RECEIVES NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS DECIDED BY MILAN (AS NOTED, </p><p>THEY HAVE NO ON-SITE RESEARCH FACILITY). ACCORDINGLY, WE </p><p>WILL DIRECT OUR EFFORTS TO THE MILAN HEADQUARTERS OF THE </p><p>COMPANY.   IN CONTRAST, DOW MANAGEMENT INTERACTS WITH ITS </p><p>PRIOLO PLANT PERSONNEL, WHO ARE WELL VERSED ON POLICY ISSUES </p><p>AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY.  ON SITE, DOW WAS A </p><p>CORPORATE CULTURE TEAM THAT WAS INTEGRATING THE DOW GLOBAL </p><p>MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY WITH THE STYLE INHERITED FROM ENICHEM. </p><p>DOW MANAGEMENT IS CLEARLY ATTENTIVE TO CHANGES IN THE POLICY </p><p>ARENA WHICH MAY AFFECT THEIR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN EUROPE </p><p>AND ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>7.
