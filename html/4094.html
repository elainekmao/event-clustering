<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 001378 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR PINHEIRO BRIEFS DIPLOMATS ON </p><p>VISIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 1354 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: At an October 28 briefing, UN Special </p><p>Rapporteur Pinheiro told diplomats in Rangoon that during his </p><p>12-day visit to Burma he strongly encouraged the SPDC to </p><p>address continuing human rights abuses.  He also encouraged </p><p>the international community to implement programs that will </p><p>promote human rights in Burma (citing Australia\'s human </p><p>rights training program as an example), or conditions will </p><p>get much worse.  Democratic reform, in his view, is not in </p><p>the offing and human rights problems in Burma are too </p><p>pressing to wait for this change.  Pinheiro said Secretary </p><p>One Khin Nyunt was "not negative" in response to his call for </p><p>action on abuses and was proud of the SPDC\'s successes.  Khin </p><p>Nyunt cited actions to combat narcotics, trafficking in </p><p>persons, and HIV/AIDS as evidence of progress.  Pinheiro said </p><p>the SPDC has been responsive to ICRC recommendations for </p><p>improvements in prisons and conditions for political </p><p>prisoners, in particular, have improved as a result. </p><p>Pinheiro proposed to the SPDC the expansion of ICRC </p><p>monitoring to areas of continuing conflict.  He also </p><p>encouraged the SPDC to endorse one of three options for an </p><p>international assessment of the alleged systematic rapes by </p><p>the military in Shan State.  While Pinheiro\'s briefing was </p><p>characteristically upbeat - designed to keep the door open </p><p>with the regime - he privately expressed his frustration to </p><p>COM Martinez, noting that he does not know how much longer he </p><p>will continue as SR if the regime does not address continuing </p><p>serious abuses.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>General Assessment </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On October 28, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights </p><p>in Burma Paulo Sergio Pinheiro (SR) briefed the diplomatic </p><p>corps here at the completion of his 12-day visit, the fourth </p><p>visit since he was appointed.  The SR said that the SPDC had </p><p>cooperated fully in his requests for meetings and assisted </p><p>him in all logistical aspects of the visit.  He had met with </p><p>Secretary One Khin Nyunt, the Foreign Minister, Deputy </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Foreign Minister, the Ministry of Home Affairs and other SPDC </p><p>officials in Rangoon and at the regional level when he </p><p>traveled to Mon State.  The SR said he carried the same </p><p>message to all these officials at each meeting: the SPDC </p><p>needs to do more now to address the serious human rights </p><p>abuses in the country.  He characterized the officials\' </p><p>responses to this appeal as "not negative."  He said that </p><p>while they did not make any specific commitments in response, </p><p>they did not harshly rebut his statement that problems exist; </p><p>he took this as a positive indication.  Secretary One </p><p>described to the SR how the SPDC had taken many positive </p><p>steps, citing in particular, progress in combating narcotics, </p><p>trafficking in persons, and HIV/AIDS.  The SR was surprised </p><p>by Secretary One\'s openness compared with previous meetings </p><p>in discussing political prisoners.  Rather than denying the </p><p>existence of political prisoners as he had done in the past, </p><p>Secretary One said the GOB has released over 400 political </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>prisoners in "direct response" to the SR\'s requests, and </p><p>readily discussed with the SR remaining categories and </p><p>subcategories of political prisoners. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  SR Pinheiro appealed to the international community </p><p>to "cooperate now" with the SPDC on ways to improve human </p><p>rights in the country.  He said there is no reason to hope </p><p>for democratic change anytime soon - "democracy (at least the </p><p>Western version) is far away in the minds of these gentlemen" </p><p>- and conditions demand action now on programs that will </p><p>improve human rights.  Pinheiro emphasized that "if there is </p><p>not greater cooperation now things will get much worse."  He </p><p>cited the Australian human rights workshops for SPDC </p><p>officials as an example of an activity that has been </p><p>criticized but which he endorses because it sensitizes </p><p>trainees to international human rights standards.  He </p><p>strongly encouraged the international community to "engage" </p><p>by identifying community activities in cooperation with the </p><p>NLD that will secure better human rights. </p><p> </p><p>ICRC Gets High Marks </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  SR Pinheiro said his visits to prisons indicate that </p><p>the International Committee for the Red Cross is continuing </p><p>to make good progress in improving prison conditions.  He </p><p>said the ICRC has made over 200 visits to 80 facilities in </p><p>the last two years, and prisoners confirm to him that, as a </p><p>result, conditions have greatly improved.  Pinheiro said that </p><p>he has heard no reports of abuses of political prisoners in </p><p>the last two years.  He noted that while prison conditions </p><p>for the general prison population are now generally worse </p><p>than that of political prisoners, the conditions are not that </p><p>bad compared to some others in the world (e.g. he cited the </p><p>deplorable conditions in some lock-ups in Sao Paulo.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Hoping to build on the ICRC\'s successes in prisons, </p><p>Pinheiro proposed to the SPDC (after previously clearing with </p><p>ICRC) that ICRC be allowed to establish a presence in all </p><p>areas of armed conflict to report on abuses in </p><p>confidentiality to the SPDC.  He did not yet have a response </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to the proposal. </p><p> </p><p>Follow-up on Shan Rape Allegations </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Pinheiro said the SPDC had thoroughly briefed him </p><p>their latest investigation into the Army\'s alleged use of </p><p>systematic rape in Shan State.  He said that while the </p><p>investigation appeared to be professional and the SPDC had </p><p>apparently put a lot of energy into it, he told them that no </p><p>one would believe it because it was done by the military. </p><p>Warning SPDC officials that if they persisted in just denying </p><p>the allegations they would face serious consequences from the </p><p>international community, he offered three options for an </p><p>independent assessment (as reported in reftel).  The options </p><p>were: </p><p> </p><p>-- a national Ombudsman or Commission (composed of opposition </p><p>and government members) created with the assistance of the </p><p>UNHRC (which ASSK agreed to participate in although she was </p><p>skeptical if it could work, he said); </p><p> </p><p>-- a team of experts led by the SR to investigate the </p><p>charges; and </p><p> </p><p>-- a Commission of Inquiry with a mandate from the UN </p><p>Secretary General or UNHRC. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Pinheiro said he believes the second option would be </p><p>the most effective and he had told the SPDC this.  He noted </p><p>that a prerequisite for any of the options would be </p><p>sufficient funding from the international community (Note: </p><p>COM Martinez told the group the U.S. would support the idea </p><p>but pressed others, not just the EU but ASEAN and other </p><p>neighboring countries, to also provide resources so that it </p><p>did not appear to be a U.S. controlled activity.  End Note.) </p><p>Pinheiro also said that any inquiry should not be limited to </p><p>just the Shan State rape allegations but should address </p><p>abuses in general in areas of conflict; "black areas."  He </p><p>emphasized that abuses by armed insurgent groups must also be </p><p>addressed in the inquiry, as this is a problem that is rarely </p><p>mentioned. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Pinheiro said he will not mention these options in </p><p>the press briefing on his trip (wanting to give the SPDC </p><p>flexibility in its response) but he told the SPDC that if </p><p>they do not express a preference to him by the time of his </p><p>report on November 6, he is prepared to initiate option two </p><p>(in which he would personally participate).  He said the </p><p>regime appears seriously concerned about international </p><p>criticism regarding the allegations and he thinks the SPDC </p><p>will allow some independent assessment, although they have </p><p>previously stated this was out of the question. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  While Pinheiro\'s briefing to the diplomatic corps was </p><p>characteristically upbeat (he wants to keep the door open </p><p>with the regime in order to continue to push for reforms), he </p><p>has privately expressed his frustration to COM Martinez </p><p>regarding the regime\'s lack of action to curb continuing </p><p>abuses.  He told the COM early in the visit that he came to </p><p>Burma with a view to keeping communications open with the </p><p>regime and giving them the benefit of the doubt whenever </p><p>possible.  He said his patience is running out as he sees </p><p>very little progress on curbing serious human rights abuses, </p><p>especially in areas of conflict.  He said he does not </p><p>believe, on balance, that abuses of religious freedom or </p><p>prisoners for instance make Burma the "world champions" </p><p>compared to abuses in other countries, but he does find the </p><p>pervasive SPDC control over every citizen\'s life oppressive </p><p>and the abuses against citizens deemed enemies of the state </p><p>unacceptable.  It is these abuses, unfortunately, that the </p><p>SPDC seems least willing to address.  Pinheiro told the COM </p><p>that he may not continue as SR if he does not see some change </p><p>by the SPDC in the near future.  He quipped that they would </p><p>be sorry to lose him, someone who has been willing to try to </p><p>work with them, if he is replaced by an SR from a country </p><p>with a less flexible Burma policy than Brazil, i.e., the </p><p>Scandinavians or EU. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
