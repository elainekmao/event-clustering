<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008363 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/20/2010 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, SOCI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: LOCAL IMPORTER SUSPECTED OF CRIMINALITY </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Many long-standing Kinshasa businesses are </p><p>complaining about Congo Futur, an importer that has expanded </p><p>rapidly since it started operations less than three years ago </p><p>and is now the largest food supplier in Kinshasa. </p><p>Established businesses accuse Congo Futur of various </p><p>illegalities.  Congo Futur\'s general manager claims his </p><p>company has thrived because of its efficiency. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>We Need Protection </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Manufacturers in Kinshasa have a long tradition of </p><p>blaming their problems on low-priced imports.  At various </p><p>times during the last year, local producers of textiles, </p><p>batteries, razors, palm oil and flour have all briefed </p><p>econoff on the unfair competition they face and the need for </p><p>protectionist policy to preserve jobs.  This complaint has </p><p>now spread to importers, and their accusations center on a </p><p>company that has been doing business in Kinshasa for less </p><p>than three years, called Congo Futur. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Business contacts say that Congo Futur has become </p><p>Kinshasa\'s largest importer of dry staples (e.g. flour, rice, </p><p>salt and sugar) and the second largest importer of frozen </p><p>food.  Its volume has increased from less than 4000 tons in </p><p>1998 to over 90,000 tons in 2000.  A manufacturer of sacks </p><p>told the Ambassador that his largest clients, a local flour </p><p>mill and the national sugar company, were reducing </p><p>production, severely cutting his business.  The largest </p><p>importer of frozen foods to Kinshasa told Econoff that Congo </p><p>Futur had cut prices so far that he was being forced to sell </p><p>below cost to stay in business.  He speculates that Congo </p><p>Futur must be laundering money and/or trying to drive out </p><p>competitors to secure a monopoly.  Other contacts acknowledge </p><p>the weakness of these two hypothesese, since converting </p><p>dollars to Congolese francs is an expensive laundering </p><p>mechanism and low barriers to entry mean that a monopoly </p><p>would provide at best small and fleeting profits.  They </p><p>wonder if Congo Futur is buying diamonds or smuggling </p><p>Congolese francs to rebel occupied zones, where the franc is </p><p>worth almost twice as much as in Kinshasa.  All assume that </p><p>Congo Futur has corrupted tax and customs authority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Customs Director Defensive </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On December 13, the Director General of the Congolese </p><p>Customs Agency, an Embassy contact who is generally </p><p>considered a competent professional, called Econoff to ask </p><p>her to come to his office.  Expecting a visa referral </p><p>request, she complied.  Instead of inquiring about a visa, </p><p>the Customs director said that he wanted to assure the </p><p>Embassy that, regardless of what they heard, he had not been </p><p>corrupted by Congo Futur.  He did not rule out the </p><p>possibility that some of his subordinates were giving the </p><p>company favorable treatment, and said he had initiated a </p><p>discreet inquiry.  He implied that the subject required </p><p>careful handling because of the possibility that powerful </p><p>political figures were somehow behind the company\'s success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Congo Futur\'s Story </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On December 15 Econoff called on Ahmed Tajideen, the </p><p>General Manager of Congo Futur, to get his views on the </p><p>Kinshasa market and his response to these suspicions. </p><p>Tajideen was somewhat surprised at the Embassy\'s interest, </p><p>but acknowledged that he was aware of the rumors circulating </p><p>about his company.  After a nervous start, he seemed pleased </p><p>to have the opportunity to explain how he operated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) According to Tajideen, Congo Futur is the subsidiary </p><p>of an Antwerp-based family business called Soafrimex which is </p><p>also a major importer in Angola, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, </p><p>Ghana and the Gambia.  The company decided to move into Congo </p><p>because it saw profit opportunity in the relatively high </p><p>prices it saw in Congolese markets.  He attributed the </p><p>company\'s success to a combination of efficiency and a high </p><p>volume strategy.  To show the gains from efficiency, he said </p><p>the company had lost 6 percent of the first shipment of food </p><p>imported through the port of Matadi, presumably to theft. </p><p>Congo Futur now has seven expatriate (Lebanese) employees </p><p>permanently assigned to Matadi and theft loss is down to 0.5 </p><p>percent.  The company responded to the unreliability of </p><p>transportation from Matadi to Kinshasa by establishing its </p><p>own trucking firm, Trans M, and now owns 60 trucks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Tajideen said that high volume gives his company a </p><p>competitive advantage in transportation and allows him to </p><p>make healthy profits with a small mark-up.  To demonstrate </p><p>his transportation cost savings, he used the example of wheat </p><p>flour.  He said that because of storage limitations, no one </p><p>can import more than 5000 tons of flour to Congo.  A small </p><p>shipload of flour might entail transportation costs of USD 60 </p><p>per ton.  His company loads a boat with 12,000-16,000 tons of </p><p>flour, reducing transportation costs to about 35 dollars a </p><p>ton.  The flour is shared between Soafrimex subsidiaries in </p><p>Angola, Mozambique and Congo.  This means that his product </p><p>delivered to Matadi costs at least 10 percent less than his </p><p>competitors\'.  He then uses a 5 to 15 percent mark-up when </p><p>the norm in Kinshasa might be 30 or 40 percent.  His vertical </p><p>integration extends to the consumer market, providing further </p><p>benefits; Congo Futur owns a bakery and indirectly owns a </p><p>chain of retail outlets.  (One of the accusations of </p><p>competitors is that bypassing the wholesale system is illegal </p><p>in the DRC.  Tajideen acknowledged this when he said Congo </p><p>Futur "indirectly" owns these retail outlets.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Tajideen said that his attention to the market also </p><p>contributes to his success; he said he spent most of the day </p><p>out of the office gathering information.  Because even market </p><p>middlemen are suffering declining purchasing power, he is </p><p>bringing in goods in smaller sacks.  He is confident that the </p><p>Kinshasa market is all about price, rather than quality, so </p><p>he seeks out the cheapest rice available on world markets, </p><p>instead of bringing in quality rice from Thailand.  Tajideen </p><p>told econoff that he pays all his taxes and even pays a duty </p><p>premium.  He said that Congolese customs authorities are used </p><p>to seeing documents reporting a 20 percent higher cost for </p><p>rice.  Instead of arguing with them about the actual price he </p><p>pays for the rice, Tajideen said he pays duty based on this </p><p>higher price. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Are They Crooks? </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Tajideen was animated and excited when talking about </p><p>his business strategy and he convinced econoff that he </p><p>aggressively pursues cost-savings.  It is hard, however, to </p><p>dismiss the certainty of his competitors that his prices are </p><p>patently below cost.  The Embassy FSN who arranged econoff\'s </p><p>interview reported that Congo Futur runs a side business </p><p>changing money at the parallel exchange rate.  He reported </p><p>that people with money in hard currency bank accounts who </p><p>transferred funds to Congo Futur accounts received either </p><p>Congolese francs or dollar cash at a discount of 3 to 5 </p><p>percent.  The Customs Director\'s sensitivity also suggests </p><p>that something more than just good practices underlies the </p><p>company\'s success.  Post would be interested in any </p><p>information Maputo, Luanda, Banjul or Accra might have on </p><p>Soafrimex and its subsidiaries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
