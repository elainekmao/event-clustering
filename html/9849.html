<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 002198 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PM, INL, EB, NEA AND WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, KCRM, KJUS, IZ, CA, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION: CANADIAN PERSONNEL FOR </p><p>BAGHDAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST - SEE PARA 3. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Canada has committed to providing US$215 million in </p><p>humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for post-conflict </p><p>Iraq, with emphasis on access to basic services (water, </p><p>sanitation, health care); building democratic institutions; </p><p>reforming judicial, police and correctional services; </p><p>strengthening civil society; and promoting human rights.  As </p><p>part of this effort, the GoC is trying to deploy two </p><p>officials to Baghdad who would serve as a national liaison to </p><p>the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and as police </p><p>advisor to the CPA, respectively. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ann Flanagan, Deputy Director of Foreign Affairs\' </p><p>Middle East Division, has requested our assistance in getting </p><p>CPA approval for these Canadian officers.  The GoC has </p><p>proposed that FSO Ben Rowswell be attached to the CPA as </p><p>Canadian national liaison, and that RCMP officer David Beer </p><p>be deployed as police advisor to the CPA.  Beer was part of </p><p>the multinational police assessment team that visited Iraq </p><p>for 4 weeks in June, during which time he served for 3 weeks </p><p>as principal advisor to the Chief of Police for Baghdad West. </p><p> Both Rowswell and Beer are available to deploy immediately, </p><p>and they have already been proposed by the Canadian Embassy </p><p>in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Please advise ASAP on the Canadians\' </p><p>proposals to deploy Rowswell and Beer to the CPA.  Having </p><p>these two individuals in place will help bolster policing </p><p>efforts and speed the delivery of Canadian assistance, </p><p>especially given the absence of a Canadian Embassy in Baghdad. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
