MADAGASCAR IS THE WORLD\'S FOURTH LARGEST ISLAND AND ONE </p><p>OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.  THREE OUT OF FOUR </p><p>MALAGASY HOUSEHOLDS FALL BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL.  THE </p><p>COUNTRY IS DIVIDED INTO SIX REGIONAL PROVINCES, WHICH ARE </p><p>FURTHER DIVIDED INTO ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN DISTRICTS.  EACH </p><p>PROVINCE IS LEAD BY A REGIONAL GOVERNOR APPOINTED BY THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER.  MADAGASCAR REGULARLY EXPERIENCES NATURAL </p><p>DISASTERS, SPECIFICALLY DROUGHTS, CYCLONES AND LOCUSTS. </p><p>DROUGHTS ARE A HAZARD OF THE SOUTH, WHERE THEY LEAD TO THE </p><p>STRUGGLE TO HARVEST WATER FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, CROPS AND </p><p>LIVESTOCK.  CYCLONES CAN STRIKE THE ISLAND FROM ANY COAST, </p><p>BUT PRIMARILY INFLICT DAMAGE ALONG THE COUNTRY\'S EAST COAST, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05132  01 OF 05  220709Z </p><p>WHERE THEY DESTROY HOMES AND CROPS AND FURTHER ERODE THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ALREADY CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE.  LOCUSTS </p><p>TRADITIONALLY ATTACK CROPS IN THE SOUTH BEFORE SPREADING TO </p><p>OTHER PARTS OF THE ISLAND, PARTICULARLY THE WEST AND CENTRAL </p><p>REGIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MADAGASCAR HAS 9KM OF PAVED ROAD AND 60KM OF DIRT ROADS </p><p>FOR EVERY 100 SQUARE KM.  DURING THE RAINY SEASON, ENTIRE </p><p>REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY BECOME INACCESSIBLE BECAUSE OF POOR </p><p>ROAD CONDITIONS.  MADAGASCAR IS EMERGING FROM A POLITICAL </p><p>CRISIS THAT LEFT ROADS AND PORTS BLOCKED AND NATURAL </p><p>DISASTER MITIGATION AND RESPONSE SYSTEMS PARALYZED (REFTEL). </p><p>TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, CYCLONE KESINY STRUCK THE ISLAND </p><p>DURING THE MIDST OF THE POLITICAL CRISIS, MAKING AN ALREADY </p><p>TENUOUS SITUATION - IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTING FOOD AID - </p><p>WORSE. </p><p> </p><p>6.

WFP MADAGASCAR EMPLOYS NEARLY 20 UNITED NATION\'S </p><p>VOLUNTEERS (UNVS)AND FIELD MONITORS TO OVERSEE ITS </p><p>OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>WFP WAREHOUSING </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  MISSION VISITED WFP WAREHOUSES AND TRANSITIONAL STORAGE </p><p>SPACES IN THE AREA AROUND FORT-DAUPHIN IN THE SOUTHEAST AND </p><p>IN TAMATAVE IN EAST CENTRAL MADAGASCAR.  ROUGH TERRAIN AND </p><p>TIME CONSTRAINTS PREVENTED A VISIT TO TULEAR. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WFP RECEIVES COMMODITIES FROM TWO PRIMARY PORTS: </p><p>TAMATAVE IN EAST CENTRAL MADAGASCAR; AND TULEAR IN THE </p><p>SOUTHWEST.  THE PORT AT TAMATAVE IS THE LARGEST AND MOST </p><p>ACTIVE.  DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE POLITICAL CRISIS, FACTIONS </p><p>LOYAL TO THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION CONTROLLED THIS PORT </p><p>AND EFFECTIVELY PREVENTED THE RECEIPT AND DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>SHIPPED COMMODITIES (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>11.  AT THE TIME OF INSPECTION, WFP\'S FACILITIES WERE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05132  02 OF 05  220709Z </p><p>STOCKED WITH RICE, CORN SOY BLEND, AND BEANS FROM VARIOUS </p><p>DONORS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT (USG), THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN (GOJ) AND GOVERNMENT OF DENMARK (GOD). </p><p> </p><p>12.  COMMENT:  IN ADDITION TO USAID/MADAGASCAR AND </p><p>WFP/MADAGASCAR STAFF, MISSION WAS ACCOMPANIED ON A TOUR OF </p><p>THE TAMATIVE WAREHOUSE BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM CARE AND </p><p>ADRA. THE ADRA REPRESENTATIVE EXPRESSED GREAT SURPRISE AT </p><p>THE AMOUNT OF WFP COMMODITIES CURRENTLY WAREHOUSED.  HE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THAT WFP WAS AWAITING THE DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES </p><p>RELATED TO AN UPCOMING EMERGENCY APPEAL (EMOP) AND THAT HE </p><p>COULD NOT REQUEST COMMODITIES UNTIL THAT TIME BECAUSE NONE </p><p>WOULD BE AVAILABLE.  THIS POINTS TO A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING </p><p>OF WFP\'S OPERATIONAL METHODS AND POOR INFORMATION SHARING </p><p>BETWEEN WFP AND AN IMPLEMENTING PARTNER. </p><p> </p><p>13.  MISSION OBSERVED THE THEFT OF WFP COMMODITIES WHILE </p><p>TOURING THE TAMATAVE PORT STORAGE FACILITY.  WFP LOGISTICS </p><p>STAFF WAS PRESENT AND CONFIRMED THAT THEFT IS A PROBLEM AT </p><p>THE FACILITY AND CONFIRMED WFP\'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO RESOLVE </p><p>THE ISSUE WITH THE WAREHOUSE MANAGER.  MISSION LATER LEARNED </p><p>FROM ANOTHER WFP LOGISTICS OFFICER THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF </p><p>WFP COMMODITIES ARE CONTAINERIZED, AND ARE THEREFORE THEFT </p><p>RESISTANT.  APPARENTLY, IT WAS JUST THIS MOST RECENT </p><p>SHIPMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN THAT WAS NOT </p><p>CONTAINERIZED. </p><p> </p><p>14.  MINOR COMMODITY LOSS DUE TO RODENT INFESTATION AND </p><p>WATER DAMAGE WERE OBSERVED.  THE ROOF ON ONE WFP-UTILIZED </p><p>WAREHOUSE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING REPAIRED DURING </p><p>MISSION\'S VISIT.

WFP COMMODITIES WERE SUPPORTING TWO DISTINCTIVE WATER- </p><p>HARVESTING SITES.  THE FIRST SITE PROVIDES COMMODITIES TO </p><p>WORKERS WHO HAVE DUG A WELL SOME FIFTY FEET INTO THE EARTH. </p><p>HARVESTERS RETRIEVED WATER FROM THIS WELL BY EITHER </p><p>DESCENDING A SERIES OF STEPS CARVED OUT OF THE EARTH OR </p><p>THROUGH A PATH CUT THROUGH THE EARTH AND LEADING DOWN INTO </p><p>THE WELL.  EITHER ENTRY POINT REPRESENTED AN IMPROVEMENT </p><p>OVER PREVIOUS WELLS DUG WITHOUT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF </p><p>WFP.  IN THE OLDER WELLS, WOMEN AND CHILDREN FACED STEEP AND </p><p>OFTEN PERILOUS INCLINES LEADING TO THE WATER BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>17.

MISSION ALSO WITNESSED FFW ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORTED </p><p>ROAD REHABILITATION AND CONSTRUCTION.  ALONG THE EAST COAST, </p><p>THESE ACTIVITIES INVOLVE THE CLEARING OF TREES AND OTHER </p><p>FALLEN DEBRIS LEFT IN THE CYCLONE\'S WAKE.  THEY ALSO INVOLVE </p><p>REMOVING TONS OF EARTH THAT RENDER NATIONAL, SECONDARY AND </p><p>TERTIARY ROADS IMPASSABLE AS A RESULT THE MUDSLIDES CAUSED </p><p>BY THE HEAVY RAINS ASSOCIATED WITH A CYCLONE. </p><p> </p><p>19.  IN THE SOUTH, WFP\'S FFW PROJECTS ARE USED TO CARVE </p><p>ROADS THOUGH THE OTHERWISE FORBIDDING BUSH.  THESE ROADS </p><p>HELP TO LINK COMMUNITIES, WHOSE INHABITANTS PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>WFP SCHOOL FEEDING PROGRAMS, OR PROVIDE EASIER ACCESS TO </p><p>WATER-HARVESTING POINTS THROUGHOUT THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>DISASTER MITIGATION AND PREPAREDNESS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>20.

THIS PLAN, KNOWN </p><p>AS THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT, WAS </p><p>DEVELOPED IN 2000 AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING PASSED </p><p>INTO LAW WHEN THE POLITICAL CRISIS BEGAN. </p><p> </p><p>21.  THE GOM\'S STRATEGY IS COORDINATED THROUGH THE NATIONAL </p><p>DISASTER RELIEF COMMITTEE OR CNS.  THE STRATEGY RECOGNIZES </p><p>THAT MADAGASCAR IS BOTH DISASTER PRONE AND RESOURCE POOR AND </p><p>SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A WORKABLE FRAMEWORK ON THE NATIONAL, </p><p>PROVINCIAL, LOCAL AND COMMUNITY LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>22.  THE STRATEGY IDENTIFIES A GOVERNMENTAL LEAD AGENCY AS </p><p>WELL AS SUPPORT AGENCIES SPECIFIC TO A PARTICULAR EMERGENCY. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR TAKES THE LEAD WITH </p><p>RESPECT TO CYCLONES AND DROUGHT, WHILE THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE IS THE LEAD AGENCY IN RELATION TO LOCUSTS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO SUPPORTING EACH OTHER, THESE AGENCIES RECEIVE </p><p>SUPPORT FROM OTHER GOM MINISTRIES, PARTICULARLY </p><p>TRANSPORTATION. </p><p> </p><p>23.  ON THE LOCAL AND COMMUNITY LEVELS, THE STRATEGY WORKS </p><p>WITH UN VOLUNTEERS TOWARDS SENSITIZING THE POPULATION AND </p><p>HELPING THEM PREPARE FOR DISASTERS.  THE STRATEGY ALSO </p><p>EMPLOYS A DISASTER PREPAREDNESS CURRICULUM THAT HAS BEEN </p><p>USED IN SCHOOLS. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>LOCUSTS </p><p>-------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05132  03 OF 05  220709Z </p><p> </p><p>24.  LOCUSTS ARE A SPECIALIZED TYPE OF GRASSHOPPER.  THEY </p><p>OCCUR EVERY YEAR IN THE SOUTH OF MADAGASCAR, PRINCIPALLY ON </p><p>THE HOROMBE PLATEAU, WHERE THEY ARE INDIGENOUS.  THE TWO </p><p>MOST COMMON SPECIES, RED LOCUSTS AND THE MADAGASCAR </p><p>MIGRATORY LOCUSTS ARE TYPICALLY IN THE SOLITARY, NON- </p><p>MIGRATORY FORM, AND SELDOM CAUSE ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT </p><p>CROP DAMAGE WHEN IN THIS RECESSIONAL PHASE. </p><p> </p><p>25.  HOWEVER, WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BECOME OPTIMAL, </p><p>THESE LOCUSTS MULTIPLY RAPIDLY AND DEVELOP INTO A MORE </p><p>ROBUST MIGRATORY FORM.  IN THIS PHASE, BOTH SPECIES CAN </p><p>MIGRATE GREAT DISTANCES, AND SO BECOME A MAJOR THREAT TO </p><p>CROPS, PARTICULARLY IN THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL REGIONS WHERE </p><p>RICE IS A MAJOR CROP.  LOCUSTS PLAGUES CAN AND HAVE IN THE </p><p>PAST UNDERMINED THE FOOD SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>26.  BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL CRISIS PREVENTATIVE MEASURES </p><p>LIKE THE SPRAYING OF PESTICIDES COULD NOT BE TAKEN TO DEAL </p><p>WITH THE COUNTRY\'S LOCUST PROBLEM (REF TEL).  HAD IT BEEN </p><p>POSSIBLE TO SPRAY CROPS BETWEEN JANUARY AND JUNE, THE </p><p>LOCUSTS COULD HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED.

THESE DECISIONS ARE FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE REALITY </p><p>THAT LOCUSTS ARE USED AS A FOOD COMMODITY FOR CERTAIN TRIBES </p><p>OF MALAGASY. </p><p> </p><p>30.

MADAGASCAR\'S POOR INFRASTRUCTURE RENDERS POCKETS OF THE </p><p>POPULATION SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOOD INSECURITY, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>ISOLATED, REMOTE AREAS.

WFP/MADAGASCAR SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD </p><p>IN THIS TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>41.  WFP SHOULD IMPROVE INFORMATION SHARING WITH ITS </p><p>IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS RELATIVE TO THE LEVEL OF AVAILABLE </p><p>COMMODITIES IN-COUNTRY AND IN-WAREHOUSE AT ANY GIVEN TIME. </p><p>THIS WOULD BETTER FACILITATE THE COMMODITY REQUEST PROCESS </p><p>BETWEEN WFP AND ITS IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS. </p><p> </p><p>42.

THIS </p><p>INDICATES POOR COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE </p><p>GOM AND IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS.  ACTIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO </p><p>CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>45.
