<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002707 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT U. S./U. K. UNDER FIRE, HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.  Under headline "Are the U.K. and U.S. moving </p><p>      against Zimbabwe7" the independent daily the </p><p>      "The Daily News" published a November 25 op-ed </p><p>      by "Ann Talbotr" (sic) accusing the United </p><p>      States and Britain of "using starvation. . .as a </p><p>      means of tightening their grip on Africa." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.  "Amid speculation about the possible actions of </p><p>      the Britain and the United States, Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      petrol pumps have run dry, deepening the crisis </p><p>      already caused by the famine and threatening </p><p>      emergency food deliveries. . .  Whatever form </p><p>      the intervention takes, it will represent an </p><p>      implicit threat to the whole of Africa.  The </p><p>      increasingly belligerent attitude of the Bush </p><p>      administration towards Zimbabwe follows its </p><p>      attempts to establish much greater control over </p><p>      the oil reserves of West Africa.  The conclusion </p><p>      that Africa faces a new wave of imperial </p><p>      expansion is inescapable.  It is a threat that </p><p>      Mugabe and other African nationalist leaders are </p><p>      incapable of averting...  His [Bush\'sl political </p><p>      thuggery and manipulation of food aid have only </p><p>      served to provide a pretext for intervention... </p><p>      The U.S. and U.K. are blaming Mugabe for the </p><p>      situation in Zimbabwe, but they have done </p><p>      nothing to alleviate the hunger in these other </p><p>      countries where Mugabe cannot be held </p><p>      responsible.  Instead the imperialist powers are </p><p>      using starvation. for which they are largely </p><p>      responsible, as a means of tightening their grip </p><p>      on Africa.  The present famines are the direct </p><p>      result of International Monetary Fund policies </p><p>      that have left African governments unable to buy </p><p>      food that is in plentiful supply outside the </p><p>      re&ions immediately hit by drou&ht and wars, </p><p>      which have been fomented by the West." </p><p> </p><p>  3.  [omment.  The ill-informed, anti-West sentiments </p><p>      in this op-ed are not standard fare for the </p><p>      independent "Daily News."  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
