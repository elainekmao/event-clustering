Whitehead DUE TO 1.5 (b) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Summary:  Experience gained from last June\'s &Final </p><p>Push8 attempt at mass action has altered the strategic </p><p>vision for those promoting and organizing non-violent protest </p><p>in Zimbabwe.  An accurate assessment of the situation and </p><p>temperament of the Zimbabwean population points away from a </p><p>&Serbian style8 mass uprising that aims at the immediate </p><p>downfall of the ZANU (PF) regime.  More realistically, civil </p><p>society and the MDC have concluded that they must plan for a </p><p>longer-term struggle that engages and empowers the population </p><p>to undertake a lower intensity but sustained campaign of </p><p>peaceful protest, defiance, and non-cooperation to </p><p>demonstrate the regime,s lack of popular support and thereby </p><p>encourage negotiations and democratic reforms.  As in the </p><p>cases of organized political resistance movements in other </p><p>countries, a successful mass action campaign in Zimbabwe will </p><p>require long-term strategic planning, widespread grassroots </p><p>training in non-violent action, and a phased approach of </p><p>low-risk, confidence building actions leading gradually to </p><p>larger and stronger acts of political defiance.  A hasty </p><p>campaign of mass action risks failure and is not the best </p><p>course of action at this time.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> 2. (SBU) Non-violent resistance has been embraced by most </p><p>proponents of democratic reform in Zimbabwe as the best </p><p>strategy for influencing the course of a political transition </p><p>and for preparing Zimbabweans to defend themselves against </p><p>future state oppression.  The opposition party, trade unions, </p><p>and civil society organizations have over the last six months </p><p>employed many mass action tactics, including marches, </p><p>strikes, and a street art campaign.  Except for the MDC and </p><p>ZCTU-called strikes that were widely observed across the </p><p>country, the mass actions to date have been relatively small, </p><p>localized, and focused on selective political issues, such as </p><p>the protests organized around the international cricket </p><p>matches in Bulawayo, the Mother,s Day march organized by </p><p>Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA), and the religious services </p><p>for victims of human rights held by Archbishop Pius Ncube. </p><p>cc). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU )  The MDC-led &Final Push8 campaign in June, 2003 </p><p>attempted unsuccessfully to escalate this nascent but growing </p><p>pattern of selective resistance to a mass movement of popular </p><p>political defiance that would challenge the authority of the </p><p>GOZ.  The nationwide strike, the passive aspect of the mass </p><p>action, was an overwhelming success with as much as 90% of </p><p>businesses closed in major urban areas during the course of </p><p>the week.  However, the disappointing turnout for the planned </p><p>street marches illustrated definitively that the population </p><p>was not yet prepared to suddenly undertake high-risk activist </p><p>behavior in defiance of the regime.  Subsequent analyses of </p><p>the &Final Push8 by the MDC and civil society observers </p><p>concluded that more groundwork would be required for such </p><p>ambitious action to succeed.  Experience in other countries </p><p>has conclusively shown that political defiance against a </p><p>violent regime requires careful planning and preparation. </p><p>First and foremost, prospective participants must understand </p><p>what is expected of them; they must have enough successful </p><p>experience with non-violent mass action that fear is lessened </p><p>or controlled; and they must have well-trained, disciplined </p><p>street-level organizations and leadership to guide them. </p><p>These pre-requisites for successful mass protest are all in </p><p>the early stages of development in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Zimbabwe does not have a history of non-violent </p><p>political mobilization or widespread civic participation and </p><p>organization.  The few times that specific grievances have </p><p>resulted in spontaneous street action, such as the July 1960 </p><p>protests against the Whitehead government or the 1998 food </p><p>riots, the population has been violently suppressed.  Many </p><p>older Zimbabweans also too clearly remember the brutal </p><p>methods which both the UDI Government and liberation forces </p><p>used against those whose political allegiance was suspect. </p><p>Political violence over the last three years has reaffirmed </p><p>the ruthlessness of the government in the minds of the </p><p>people.  Such liberal use of force has created a climate of </p><p>fear and powerlessness among all sectors of society that must </p><p>be overcome before a successful nation-wide resistance </p><p>campaign can be effectively launched.  As a major </p><p>complicating factor, the organizational structures of society </p><p>do not reach very deep.  Even the unions have historically </p><p>neglected to organize and empower their members at the level </p><p>of the shop floor.  The Rhodesian government and the Zanu </p><p>(PF) regime both discouraged independent social groupings and </p><p>institutions.  Civil society organizations in general are </p><p>consequently relatively new, weak, and focused on advocacy </p><p>rather than activism.  Thus, people at the grassroots have </p><p>very little experience of and very little institutional </p><p>support for organizing collective action. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Bridging the gap between fear and action will require </p><p>a civic education campaign designed specifically to spread </p><p>the idea of non-violent action and to impart skills of </p><p>community organizing.  Several civic groups as well as the </p><p>MDC expect to focus their efforts on this critical training </p><p>process over the coming months in hopes of producing a core </p><p>of disciplined and committed non-violent activists and </p><p>community organizations capable of defending their political </p><p>space and constitutional rights.  In recognition of the need </p><p>for very basic capacity building, the goals of such training </p><p>have been broadened from narrow partisan organizing to </p><p>general community empowerment.  In addition to a focus on </p><p>strengthening geographical communities, it is also envisioned </p><p>that existing organizations, such as student groups, local </p><p>church groups, and unions will be targeted for more systemic </p><p>training and organizational strengthening.  In keeping with </p><p>this new strategic focus, public calls for mass action will </p><p>most likely decline in the near term although small, limited </p><p>actions will continue.  Low-risk, community-based activities </p><p>such as street-art and graffiti messages, "resistance" music </p><p>creation and dissemination,  community "clean-up" campaigns, </p><p>community meetings and small, localized marches are planned. </p><p>Organizers hope that through such activities, communities </p><p>will become more comfortable engaging the authorities and </p><p>gain experience in organizing themselves for political </p><p>actions and exercising their political rights. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)   Coordination between the civics and the opposition </p><p>party will likely impact the speed at which this plan for </p><p>broad civic education and grassroots organizing can occur. </p><p>Over the last few months, informal links have developed </p><p>between the MDC mass action committee and civil society </p><p>groups working on mass action strategies.  Although there is </p><p>some lingering mutual suspicion of one another\'s motives and </p><p>disagreement over strategic focus and tactical approach, i.e. </p><p>short-term vs. long-term objectives and top-down vs. </p><p>bottom-up organizing, information sharing about activities </p><p>and objectives has increased.  Because the MDC suspects that </p><p>civil society is organizing another political party and civil </p><p>society believes that the MDC is only interested in co-opting </p><p>them for partisan objectives and hijacking their scarce </p><p>resources, it has been difficult for them to forge close </p><p>links.   After the "Final Push," civil society mass action </p><p>organizers, who disagreed with such a quick escalation of </p><p>mass action but supported the effort against their own better </p><p>judgement, indicated that they will not support any similar </p><p>actions in the near future.  However, MDC\'s own experience </p><p>with the "Final Push" finally convinced them of the need to </p><p>move more slowly and deliberately.  Thus, MDC and civil </p><p>society are now moving along separate but parallel tracks </p><p>that can be mutually supportive as long as </p><p>information-sharing continues. </p><p> </p><p>7. Comment:  (C) Once the concept of non-violent strategies </p><p>and community defense is grasped by a critical mass of </p><p>people, time and experience will still be needed to increase </p><p>the capacity and confidence of communities to act.  As in </p><p>other effective non-violent political struggles, a strategy </p><p>of selective resistance comprising small, local actions must </p><p>cumulatively grow into a resistance movement that encompasses </p><p>more and more areas of society.  The USG should support this </p><p>more patient course of social transformation in Zimbabwe. </p><p>While it may not be the immediate solution to the current </p><p>political impasse in the country, it can gradually bring </p><p>greater pressure to bear on the regime, channel discontent in </p><p>positive directions and promote future democratic </p><p>development.  On the other hand basing U.S. expectations for </p><p>change in Zimbabwe on a sweeping, organized or spontaneous </p><p>near-term campaign of non-violent mass action is a dubious </p><p>strategy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
