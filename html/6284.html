<p>UNCLAS SANAA 000481 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR OGC TUCKER ESKEW; DEPARTMENT FOR PA A/S </p><p>BOUCHER FROM AMBASSADOR HULL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SCUL, IZ, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ON IRAQ: YEMENI IDEAS </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) I spent two days this week in Aden publicizing U.S. </p><p>development and security projects to remind the Yemeni </p><p>government and public of their stake in our bilateral </p><p>relationship as we move toward conflict in Iraq.  One of my </p><p>more interesting encounters was with the editors of Al Ayyam </p><p>newspaper, an independent with the country\'s largest </p><p>circulation. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) During my visit, Al Ayyam not only featured U.S. </p><p>development and security projects, but also showcased an </p><p>interview with me that allowed me to put US-Iraqi policy in </p><p>the best possible light.  I was surprised to find the </p><p>newspaper\'s leadership strongly supportive of the US </p><p>commitment to removing Saddam Hussein and allowing the Iraqi </p><p>people to develop a democracy. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) As we discussed the probable conflict, Al Ayyam\'s </p><p>editors had some pointed suggestions for cushioning the </p><p>impact on Yemenis and other Arabs.  They recalled photos of </p><p>American Muslim GI\'s cleaning a mosque in Afghanistan and </p><p>then praying in it.  They also recalled a photo of American </p><p>Muslim soldiers praying on an aircraft carrier.  Both images, </p><p>they said, sent strongly positive images to Muslims.  They </p><p>also welcome President Bush\'s continuing expressions of </p><p>respect for Islam, e.g., visits to Islamic centers, meetings </p><p>with American Muslims, messages on Islamic occasions.  A </p><p>third suggestion they made was to emphasize the positive </p><p>effects of previous US military interventions in Kosovo and </p><p>in Afghanistan on the daily lives of Muslims in those </p><p>countries.  Our message: in Iraq, as in Kosovo and </p><p>Afghanistan, Muslims can look forward to better lives as a </p><p>result of US intervention. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) I very much appreciated an opportunity to meet with </p><p>you during the recent NEA Chief of Mission conference and </p><p>hope the above thoughts are helpful to you as we explain our </p><p>intervention in Iraq. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
