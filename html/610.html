<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L YEREVAN 002697 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PREL, PTER, AM, TU </p><p>SUBJ: PKK "SUPPORT" FROM ARMENIAN SOURCES </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) STATE 220237  B) YEREVAN 1701  C) YEREVAN 0165 </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. REFTEL (A) ASKED FOR A REPORT ON "POSSIBLE PKK- </p><p>ARMENIAN" LINKS AND INSTRUCTED EMBASSY YEREVAN TO </p><p>"CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION CLOSELY AND TO KEEP </p><p>US INFORMED."  WE RAISED THE SUBJECT WITH FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER PAPAZYAN JULY 26 AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN </p><p>ASKED THE SAME THING BY JOURNALISTS DURING HIS RECENT </p><p>TRIP TO THE U.S.  HIS ANSWER IS  (AND WAS) THAT "THERE </p><p>ARE NO LINKS OF ANY KIND BETWEEN THE PKK AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ARMENIA, ALTHOUGH THERE MIGHT BE SUCH </p><p>LINKS BETWEEN CERTAIN OPPOSITION GROUPS SUCH AS THE </p><p>DASHNAKS."  WHEN WE ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WAS TALKING </p><p>ABOUT THE DASHNAKS HERE OR THOSE AT PARTY HEADQUARTERS </p><p>IN ATHENS, HE REPLIED "THERE\'S NO DIFFERENCE." </p><p> </p><p>3. THIS REPLY IS CONSISTENT WITH RESPONSES WE HAVE </p><p>GOTTEN FROM SENIOR GOA OFFICIALS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR </p><p>NOW, NOT ONLY REGARDING THE PKK BUT ALSO REGARDING ALL </p><p>SORTS OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, AND PARTICULARLY THE </p><p>ASALA.  REFTEL (B) WAS THIS EMBASSY\'S ATTEMPT TO TRACK </p><p>DOWN THE BASIS OF RUMORS IN TURKEY ABOUT A PKK MAGAZINE </p><p>BEING PUBLISHED IN ARMENIA.  IT TURNS OUT THAT THE </p><p>MAGAZINE ONLY PUBLISHED TWO ISSUES, THAT THE VAST </p><p>MAJORITY OF THE KURDS IN ARMENIA ARE NON-MUSLIM (AND </p><p>APOLITICAL) YEZIDIS, AND THAT THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF </p><p>THIS MAGAZINE - ALTHOUGH PRONE TO EXAGGERATE THE LEVEL </p><p>OF POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AMONG ARMENIA\'S SMALL </p><p>KURDISH COMMUNITY - ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS NO PKK </p><p>ACTIVITY INSIDE ARMENIA.  (COMMENT:  THIS MAKES SENSE; </p><p>AT A TIME WHEN THE GOA IS TRYING TO DO ALL WITHIN ITS </p><p>POWER TO ACHIEVE NORMAL RELATIONS WITH TURKEY, WHY </p><p>WOULD IT WANT TO PROVOKE TURKEY BY ALLOWING PKK </p><p>ACTIVITY WITHIN ITS BORDERS?  FURTHERMORE, THE GOA IS </p><p>MAKING A MAXIMUM EFFORT TO CONFISCATE WEAPONRY OF ALL </p><p>TYPES FROM CIVILIANS AND PUT IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE </p><p>"PROPER" AUTHORITIES;  WHY WOULD IT COUNTENANCE THE </p><p>TRAINING OF TERRORISTS WHO COULD ONE DAY BE TURNED </p><p>AGAINST ANY TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY?) </p><p> </p><p>4. REFTEL (C) WAS AN OFFER TO DEMARCHE THE GOA ABOUT </p><p>THE ALEGED PKK PRESENCE IN A SPECIFIC REGION AS </p><p>REPORTED BY EMBASSY BAKU IN BAKU 0070.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>OUR RECORDS, THE DEPARTMENT NEVER REPLIED TO THIS </p><p>MESSAGE.  BUT WE HAVE BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT OF </p><p>TERRORISM ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH A RANGE OF SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS, ALL OF WHOM CONDEMN THE ASALA AND ALL OF ITS </p><p>COUSINS IN THE TERRORIST WORLD.  THEIR ONE REGRET IN </p><p>THIS AREA IS THAT -- AS THEY SEE IT -- THERE IS </p><p>PRECIOUS LITTLE THEY CAN DO IF, FOR EXAMPLE,  THE </p><p>DASHNAKS LIVING IN IRAN WANT TO FINANCE, TRAIN, OR </p><p>EQUIP TERRORIST UNITS OPERATING - ILLEGITIMATELY AND IN </p><p>DIRECT OPPOSITION TO GOA POLICY - IN THE NAME OF THE </p><p>ARMENIAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GILMORE </p><p></p></div>
