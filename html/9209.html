(SBU) Following the reported release of detained Turkish </p><p>special forces in northern Iraq, both Kellogg, Brown and Root </p><p>(KBR) and the World Food Program told us that the Habur </p><p>border crossing with Iraq returned to normal operation at </p><p>approximately midday on July 7.  KBR advised that some 300 </p><p>fuel trucks held up at the border were now being allowed to </p><p>cross, and the company has resumed loading of fuel for export </p><p>from Turkey.  WFP also reported that the border has reopened, </p><p>but that it could take as long as a week to clear the </p><p>accumulated backlog of trucks.  WFP reports that an </p><p>18-kilometer line of trucks is currently waiting to cross </p><p>into Iraq.  The U.S. Movement Control Team on the Iraqi side </p><p>of the gate also confirmed that the border was apparently </p><p>opened completely at about 13:00 July 7. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
