<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002970 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 09/28/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC MP PREDICTS JANUARY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN JANUARY? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A BRIEF SEPTEMBER 27 CONVERSATION WITH POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF, MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) MEMBER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT DAVID COLTART SHARED HIS VIEWS ON SEVERAL SIMMERING </p><p>POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS.  REGARDING THE STILL UNSCHEDULED 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE MDC MP SAID IT WOULD BE VERY CLOSE, AND </p><p>MOBILIZATION OF VOTERS WAS CRUCIAL FOR BOTH ZANU-PF AND THE MDC. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT THE ELECTION BE HELD </p><p>WITHIN 90 DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>MANDATE.  SINCE MUGABE\'S MANDATE EXPIRES ON APRIL 1, 2002, THE </p><p>ELECTION MUST BE HELD BETWEEN JANUARY 1 AND MARCH 31.   CURRENT </p><p>ELECTORAL LAW REQUIRES ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE ELECTION BETWEEN FIVE </p><p>AND EIGHT WEEKS IN ADVANCE, AND COLTART SAID SEVERAL SIGNS POINTED </p><p>TO AN EARLY JANUARY ELECTION.  FIRST, IT WILL BE EASIER FOR RURAL </p><p>VOTERS -- ZANU-PF\'S TRADITIONAL STRONGHOLD -- TO GET TO POLLING </p><p>STATIONS IN JANUARY, WHEN THERE IS NORMALLY A LAPSE IN THE RAINY </p><p>SEASON, AS OPPOSED TO FEBRUARY AND MARCH, WHEN THE RAINS ARE </p><p>HEAVIEST.  IN ADDITION, THE IMPENDING MAIZE SHORTAGE IS EXPECTED </p><p>TO HIT HARDEST TOWARD THE END OF THE 90-DAY PERIOD.  THIRD, IT </p><p>MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO MOUNT AN EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVATION </p><p>EFFORT SO SOON AFTER THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS.  LAST, IF THE RESULTS </p><p>OF A JANUARY ELECTION ARE INCONCLUSIVE, MUGABE WOULD HAVE TWO </p><p>MONTHS -- UNTIL HIS TERM EXPIRES -- TO MANIPULATE THE PROCESS IN </p><p>HIS FAVOR. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTORAL MISCHIEF </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ACCORDING TO COLTART, ZANU-PF\'S BOTTOM-LINE STRATEGY IS TO </p><p>INCREASE THE VOTE IN COMMUNAL FARMING AREAS --- WHERE ITS SUPPORT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02970  01 OF 02  051316Z </p><p>IS STRONGEST -- AND TO SUPPRESS THE URBAN, COMMERCIAL FARMER, AND </p><p>FARMWORKER VOTE -- AMONG WHOM THE MDC ENJOYS SOLID SUPPORT. </p><p>COLTART HAD THE DAY BEFORE VISITED HWEDZA, A TOWN APPROXIMATELY </p><p>150 KM SOUTHEAST OF HARARE TORN IN RECENT WEEKS BY AN INTENSIFIED </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST FARMERS AND FARMWORKERS.  FARMING ACTIVITY HAD </p><p>CEASED ENTIRELY ON 24 OF THE 45 COMMERCIAL FARMS IN THE AREA, </p><p>COLTART REPORTED.  ON 19 OF THOSE 24, THERE WERE NO WORKERS LEFT, </p><p>AS THEY HAD BEEN FORCQINTO HIDING BY ZANU-PF\'S MILITIA.  COLTART </p><p>SAID HE HAS TOLD THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) LEADERSHIP </p><p>THAT THEY MUST DO MORE TO PUBLICIZE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN HWEDZA </p><p>AND IN OTHER AREAS.  TOWARD THAT END, HE SUGGESTED THAT THE CFU </p><p>HOLD WEEKLY NEWS CONFERENCES AT WHICH THEY SHOW VIDEO FOOTAGE, BUT </p><p>HE SAID THE ORGANIZATION PREFERS TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE AND AVOID </p><p>BURNING ITS BRIDGES WITH GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ASKED WHETHER VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION WOULD KEEP URBAN </p><p>VOTERS AWAY FROM THE POLLS, COLTART SAID NO, BUT MENTIONED OTHER </p><p>TACTICS WHICH COULD KEEP THEM AT HOME ON ELECTION DAY.  ONE WOULD </p><p>BE TO REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY THE NUMBER OF POLLING STATIONS IN URBAN </p><p>AREAS, MAKING ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WITHOUT </p><p>RELIABLE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION.  HE NOTED THAT 170 POLLING </p><p>STATIONS WERE USED IN BULAWAYO FOR THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN </p><p>JUNE 2000, IN CONTRAST TO 71 FOR THE SEPTEMBER 2001 MAYORAL VOTE, </p><p>ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE LOW TURNOUT IN THE LATTER </p><p>ELECTION.  COLTART ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT ZANU-PF MIGHT </p><p>ARRANGE FOR ITS SUPPORTERS TO DOUBLE- OR TRIPLE-VOTE.  ONE </p><p>APPROACH THEY MIGHT EMPLOY, COLTART SURMISED, WOULD BE TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT SELECTED POLLING STATIONS ARE SUPERVISED BY SYMPATHETIC </p><p>PRESIDING OFFICERS WILLING TO OVERLOOK THE INDELIBLE INK PLACED ON </p><p>VOTERS\' HANDS WHEN THEY CAST A BALLOT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02970  01 OF 02  051316Z </p><p>U.S. TRIP </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) COLTART MENTIONED THAT HE WOULD BE IN NEW YORK ON PERSONAL </p><p>BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL DAYS BEGINNING OCTOBER 9.  HE ALSO PLANS TO </p><p>VISIT WASHINGTON OCTOBER 15-16, WHEN HE WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR </p><p>MEETINGS WITH USG OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE RULING PARTY\'S STRATEGY OF INCREASING TURNOUT IN RURAL </p><p>COMMUNAL AREAS AND SUPPRESSING THE URBAN VOTE IS PROBABLY THE BEST </p><p>METHOD AVAILABLE TO ZANU-PF IN ITS QUEST TO RETAIN POWER.  URBAN </p><p>VOTERS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE DETERRED, HOWEVER, BY MANY OF THE </p><p>OBSTACLES THROWN IN THEIR WAY, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO TURN OUT IN </p><p>LARGE NUMBERS ON ELECTION DAY.  THE RESIDENTS OF CITIES AND TOWNS </p><p>HAVE THUS FAR BORNE THE BRUNT OF ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, AND </p><p>THEY ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) REGARDING THE TIMING OF THE ELECTION, COLTART MAKES A </p><p>LOGICAL CASE FOR EARLY JANUARY.  HOWEVER, A LAPSE IN THE RAINY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8801 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02970  02 OF 02  051317Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------2A5A7D  051317Z /07 </p><p>P 050807Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9893 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002970 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 09/28/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC MP PREDICTS JANUARY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>SEASON IS FAR FROM A SURE THING; IN 2000, A DRY SPELL OCCURRED IN </p><p>DECEMBER AND NONE AT ALL THE YEAR BEFORE THAT.  ZANU-PF\'S CHIEF </p><p>WHIP IN PARLIAMENT, JORAM GUMBO, TOLD US ON OCTOBER 2 THAT THE </p><p>RULING PARTY WOULD NOT BE READY FOR A JANUARY ELECTION AND NOTED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02970  02 OF 02  051317Z </p><p>THAT A THIRD OF THE COUNTRY LIKELY WOULD BE INACCESSIBLE THEN, </p><p>MAKING CAMPAIGNING -- AND VOTING -- IMPOSSIBLE IN ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>HEARTLAND.  GUMBO SAID THE PARTY\'S PREFERENCE WOULD BE APRIL (N.B. </p><p>WHICH WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL), BY WHICH TIME THE RAINS USUALLY </p><p>HAVE SLACKENED.  WE CAN ONLY SURMISE THAT GUMBO HAS YET TO FACTOR </p><p>THE LOOMING FOOD SHORTAGES EXPECTED NEXT SPRING INTO HIS CALENDAR. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
