<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000813 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PGOV, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: QUIET REIGNS ON STRIKE\'S THIRD DAY </p><p> </p><p>REFERENCE: KATHMANDU 804 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  The third day of a Maoist-declared </p><p>general strike passed relatively quietly, with ever more </p><p>businesses and vehicles daring to risk retaliation from </p><p>the insurgents.  Three bomb blasts were reported in the </p><p>capital - including a petrol bomb attack on a motorcyclist </p><p>who broke the strike - but no injuries resulted. </p><p>Throughout Nepal long distance traffic remained suspended. </p><p>Citizens rallied to protest the Maoists action.  Although </p><p>more residents are defying the strike each day, the </p><p>insurgents have shown a willingness to escalate their </p><p>violence and intimidation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Quiet, but Scattered Incidents Mar Third Day </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The third day of the five-day April 23-27 general </p><p>strike called by Maoist insurgents passed relatively </p><p>quietly.  More traffic - including some public buses - </p><p>plied Kathmandu\'s streets, and fewer businesses stayed </p><p>shuttered.  As of COB three serious incidents were </p><p>reported in the capital.  Late in the morning a bomb was </p><p>set off in a bus parked at the old bus station near Ratna </p><p>Park in the center of the city.  No one was on the bus at </p><p>the time, and no injuries were reported.  Around two hours </p><p>later a group of three men threw a petrol bomb at a </p><p>motorcycle passing by a major intersection.  The </p><p>motorcyclist escaped injury, but the men escaped. </p><p>Finally, at around 4 p.m. a bomb reportedly exploded in </p><p>the New Baneshwor neighborhood, although when contacted </p><p>police sources were unable to confirm the incident. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Reports from outlying provinces indicate that life </p><p>has mostly returned to normal with the notable exception </p><p>of inter-city traffic.  Long distance bus and trucking </p><p>services remained at a standstill throughout the country. </p><p> </p><p>Don\'t Try This At Home </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In addition to the April 24 incidents reported </p><p>Reftel, two Maoists died that day when explosive devices </p><p>they were attempting to set went off prematurely.  One </p><p>Maoist hurt himself trying to throw a Molotov at an </p><p>electricity transmitter in Kathmandu.  He was taken to a </p><p>hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries.  The </p><p>second perished while hanging a bomb from an electric pole </p><p>in Lalitpur district, adjacent to the capital.  Four other </p><p>Maoists were caught in flagrante delicto when trying to </p><p>plant a bomb at the "SOS Children\'s Home," or orphanage, </p><p>in the Koteshwor area of Kathmandu.  [Note:  At an April </p><p>24 dinner hosted by Chief of Army Staff Rana, senior RNA </p><p>officers told Emboffs that security forces had made </p><p>significant progress in arresting individuals responsible </p><p>for acts of intimidation and terror in the capital.  End </p><p>Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Urbanites Take to Streets in Protest </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Groups of citizens from both Kathmandu and </p><p>neighboring Patan held rallies April 25 to protest the </p><p>Maoists\' actions and to call for peace.  About one hundred </p><p>politicians and intellectuals started the day by holding a </p><p>peace rally that trailed through the narrow lanes of </p><p>historic Patan.  Then businessmen who occupy a shopping </p><p>center in the midst of Kathmandu\'s business district </p><p>convened a meeting for unity against the Maoist strike. </p><p>After the meeting adjourned the businessmen held a </p><p>motorcycle and vehicle rally in the city center. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) As Post predicted, observation of the strike fell </p><p>sharply on the third day.  The self-immolation of a few </p><p>hapless Maoists notwithstanding, the continued bomb blasts </p><p>and the arrests of Maoists caught in the act of bomb- </p><p>throwing or other intimidation suggest that the insurgents </p><p>will continue to use violent tactics to intimidate the </p><p>public into going along with their general strike.  As </p><p>today\'s rallies illustrate, the chorus of voices </p><p>complaining about the effects of the bandh - and </p><p>especially the economic costs - continues to grow.  The </p><p>Nepalese seem eager to get back to business. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
