<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001369 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION AU SUMMIT; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "AU must make a stand" the independent </p><p>      daily "The Daily News" dedicated its July 3 editorial to </p><p>      urge the African Union (AU) - meeting in Maputo, </p><p>      Mozambique, next week for its second summit - to "publicly </p><p>      and firmly denounce Harare" for human rights abuses, the </p><p>      erosion of the rule of law and bad governance in Zimbabwe. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The AU will next week have another chance to put its </p><p>      high ideals to the test by boldly condemning Harare\'s naked </p><p>      abuse of power and flouting of internationally accepted </p><p>      norms of good governance. . .Next week\'s Mozambican summit </p><p>      coincides with the first visit to the continent of American </p><p>      President George Bush, who has not minced his words in </p><p>      condemning the blatant repression of its people by a </p><p>      government that is determined to hold on to power at all </p><p>      costs.  It would be a shameful act on the part of Africa\'s </p><p>      leaders if they failed to take a stand on the basic issues </p><p>      that have been highlighted by those bodies that have been </p><p>      voluble in their criticism of the rights abuses in </p><p>      Zimbabwe. . .They are especially crucial for the AU, which </p><p>      has adopted as its economic program the New Partnership for </p><p>      Africa\'s development (NEPAD), which is anchored in the </p><p>      observance by African governments of the rule of law and </p><p>      good governance to reverse the continent\'s economic </p><p>      decline, endemic poverty and costly civil wars.  African </p><p>      leaders will best serve their own cause and the cause of </p><p>      democracy in Zimbabwe if they publicly and firmly denounce </p><p>      Harare for failing to live up to the principles espoused by </p><p>      the AU and NEPAD. . .If the AU fails to vigorously meet the </p><p>      challenge presented by Zimbabwe, it will merely become </p><p>      another albatross around the continent\'s neck." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
