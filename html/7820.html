Please provide a short evaluative narrative of </p><p>host government commitment to fiscal transparency and </p><p>accountability (not to exceed two or three </p><p>paragraphs). </p><p> </p><p>-- Sri Lanka has achieved a substantial degree of </p><p>fiscal transparency in areas such as legal and </p><p>administrative framework, compilation and reporting of </p><p>fiscal accounts for the central government, and </p><p>explicit separate and aggregate accounts for the </p><p>public corporations.  This framework has been enhanced </p><p>by a new Fiscal Responsibility (Management) Act.  The </p><p>Act lays out clear obligations for budget preparation, </p><p>monitoring and parliamentary review with explicit </p><p>medium term targets. Success will depend on the </p><p>effective implementation of this law. </p><p> </p><p>To achieve full transparency, additional reforms are </p><p>needed.  These include the proposed multiyear program </p><p>budget framework, provision of data on accounts </p><p>payable and commitments, and publication of intra-year </p><p>data in a timely manner.  Consolidated general </p><p>government accounts need to be prepared and relations </p><p>between government and public enterprises further </p><p>clarified.  The government has moved recently to </p><p>improve the oversight role of parliament and this </p><p>could be enhanced by strengthening the audit process. </p><p> </p><p>N.  Please list U.S. government-sponsored programs and </p><p>activities that promote accurate disclosure of </p><p>revenues and expenditures in the national budgets of </p><p>your host country. Please also summarize the results </p><p>of those programs and activities (not to exceed two or </p><p>three paragraphs). </p><p> </p><p>--U.S. Treasury will provide technical assistance to </p><p>the Sri Lanka Ministry of Finance with an advisor in </p><p>governmental budgeting for a one-year period from </p><p>April, 2003.  The advisor will focus broadly on </p><p>revising the budget process to become a management and </p><p>policy implementation tool.  An advisor is also </p><p>envisioned in the area of government Debt Management, </p><p>and it is expected that his work will also result in </p><p>greater accountability and transparency on the debt </p><p>aspects of the budget. </p><p> </p><p>USAID has funded two Technical Assistance advisors who </p><p>have counseled the government on overall economic </p><p>strategy and reforms. This counsel, we believe, has </p><p>influenced the recent moves toward greater openness. </p><p> </p><p>End Questionnaire. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
