On January 23, new Minister of </p><p>Communications Miro Teixeira proposed that the GoB form an </p><p>inter-ministerial group to study and present findings on </p><p>the viability of a made-in-Brazil digital television (DTV) </p><p>standard.  The announcement immediately followed Teixeira\'s </p><p>review of a CPqD (Centro de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento em </p><p>Telecomunicacoes) report espousing the benefits of an </p><p>n </p><p>indigenous standard (Note. CPqD is an independent research </p><p>institute based in Campinas, Sao Paulo.  End Note.) </p><p>Although Teixeira had previously made statements that </p><p>Brazil should go it alone on DTV, most informed sources </p><p>assumed the new minister was still in his reading-in </p><p>period.  Teixeira\'s declared intention is to produce a </p><p>definitive GoB decision on DTV in the next six months, with </p><p>implementation to start in 2005.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) BACKGROUND.  The GoB has been debating the DTV </p><p>decision for the past several years.  In 2000, Globo </p><p>sponsored a series of tests that supposedly established the </p><p>Japanese standard as the "technically superior" model based </p><p>on its alleged mobile capabilities (reftel D).  Since that </p><p>time, the debate within ANATEL and Ministry of </p><p>Communications (MOC) circles turned from technical points </p><p>to discussion about the need to define the "business model" </p><p>and solicit "offsets."  In April 2002, then-Minister of </p><p>Communications Juarez Quadros told Ambassador the MOC </p><p>viewed the technical capabilities of all three standards as </p><p>approaching parity, and therefore a non-issue (reftel C). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In September 2002, the outgoing GoB sang its swan </p><p>song on the subject by publishing an official strategy </p><p>defining technical requirements, outlining desirable </p><p>"deliverables" to be negotiated, and expanding </p><p>participation in the process to several ministries (reftel </p><p>B).  As we commented at the time, in so doing the GoB </p><p>brought the DTV process in effect back to square one.  END </p><p>BACKGROUND. </p><p> </p><p>ENTER THE NEW BOSS, NOT ENTIRELY LIKE THE OLD BOSS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>4. (U) Shortly after being sworn-in as Minister of </p><p>Communications, Miro Teixeira (bio in reftel A) suggested </p><p>that Brazil develop its own DTV standard, perhaps in </p><p>partnership with China and/or India.  Although many </p><p>informed insiders believed the Minister was simply not up </p><p>to speed on the issue, CPqD subsequently gave force to his </p><p>assertions by presenting a report on the feasibility of the </p><p>indigenous standard concept.  According to the CPqD report, </p><p>a Brazilian DTV standard could be created within a year and </p><p>be ready for debut in mid-2005.  The quoted R$100 million </p><p>cost would be financed by FUNTTEL (Fund for </p><p>Telecommunications Technological Development.)  Proponents </p><p>of the report claim Brazil could reduce unit cost by </p><p>avoiding royalties, while creating a potential export </p><p>platform for other countries that might adopt the Brazilian </p><p>standard.  (Comment:  CPqD is a former government research </p><p>institute that underwent phased-privatization over a number </p><p>of years, and now must seek its own financing sources.  The </p><p>credibility of the organization is unclear.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THOSE WHO CANNOT REMEMBER THE PAST. </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) Teixeira, in making his earlier comments and now </p><p>in announcing the inter-ministerial study, risks repeating </p><p>a historical mistake.  In the 1960s, when world governments </p><p>were choosing color television standard, Brazil\'s military </p><p>dictators decided to go it alone by creating the PAL-M </p><p>standard.  Contrary to the GoB hope, PAL-M did not widely </p><p>expand beyond Brazil and resulted in higher unit costs. </p><p>(Note: Econoffs have heard ANATEL officers joke about the </p><p>failure of the PAL-M system many times over the course of </p><p>the last year.)  Convincing GoB officials that choosing an </p><p>indigenous DTV standard would be to tread down the same </p><p>false path twice will be one of Post\'s strategies in any </p><p>upcoming debate on the subject. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  MISSION RESPONSE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Minister\'s announcement indicated that the </p><p>inter-ministerial group, to include the Ministry of </p><p>Communications, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the </p><p>Ministry of Trade and Development, and the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Relations, would conclude a study and present </p><p>findings leading to a decision within the next six months. </p><p>This affords ample mission time to engage the GoB on the </p><p>merits of CPqD\'s paper, and to continue arguing that the </p><p>ATSC standard presents the best path to achieving Brazilian </p><p>social and economic goals.  We will not be alone in </p><p>pointing out the defects of a native Brazilian standard. </p><p>There have already been editorials in Folha and the Sao </p><p>Paulo Jornal da Tarde (left-leaning regional newspaper) </p><p>calling Teixeira\'s concept "extreme" in the case of the </p><p>former, and asserting the decision "would trade probable </p><p>profits for certain losses" in the case of the latter. </p><p>Informal meetings between Consulate Rio and high-level </p><p>ANATEL advisors indicate similar sentiment, and ABERT </p><p>(Associacao Brasilia de Emissoras de Radio e Televisao, </p><p>whose largest member is Globo) has also already voiced </p><p>concerns. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The MOC\'s door is open.  Advisors in the MOC say </p><p>that Teixeira is interested in obtaining more information </p><p>on ATSC, and is looking forward to a courtesy call with the </p><p>Ambassador.  Post strategy will be to stick to arguments </p><p>concerning the potential economic gains available with ATSC </p><p>while avoiding any sidetracking to technical aspects of the </p><p>four potential standards, which has proven to be an </p><p>unproductive red herring in the past.  We will focus on </p><p>convincing the GoB that North America is already the most </p><p>well-developed market, and that neither the U.S. nor Canada </p><p>produce televisions or place onerous barriers on their </p><p>importation.  On a practical level, we will maintain our </p><p>relationship with the ATSC forum, placing them in contact </p><p>with appropriate GoB decision-makers, and working toward </p><p>facilitating information flow through frequent contact and </p><p>visitor exchanges.  Post suggests that continuation of last </p><p>year\'s superb bilateral exchanges is also vital to </p><p>maximizing communications and credibility. </p><p> </p><p>8.
