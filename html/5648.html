<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000284 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FCC FOR BOATENG, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECPS, ECON, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TELECOMMUNICATIONS EXPANSION A SUCCESS </p><p>STORY; USG CAN TAKE SOME CREDIT </p><p> </p><p> 1.  Summary: While there is still a long way to go to </p><p>bridge the telecommunications divide between Nigeria and </p><p>the developed world -- or even between Nigeria and the rest </p><p>of Africa -- the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) </p><p>has made a promising start.  Quiet support from </p><p>USAID/Nigeria, the Leland Initiative and the Federal </p><p>Communications Commission has helped the NCC create a pro- </p><p>competition and more transparent regulatory environment, </p><p>raise more than USD 1 billion for the government budget, </p><p>triple teledensity, develop a strategy for reaching rural </p><p>agricultural communities and better harmonize a regional </p><p>telecommunications policy harmonization across ECOWAS </p><p>member-states.  This Global Development Alliance centered </p><p>on the leadership role of the USAID-supported Nigerian </p><p>Communications Commission (NCC).  The USG can claim some of </p><p>the credit for making telecommunications the fastest </p><p>growing business sector in Nigeria, and after petroleum, </p><p>the sector with the greatest foreign investment.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Poor Communications Plague Nigerian Economy and Development </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Low-cost reliable telecommunications services are </p><p>accelerating sustainable development around the world.  The </p><p>weakness of the telecom sector has been a major obstacle in </p><p>the way of economic and social development in Nigeria. </p><p>When U.S. development assistance programs returned to </p><p>Nigeria in 1999, installed telephone lines for the </p><p>country\'s 120 million people numbered 700,000 of which only </p><p>450,000 lines were estimated to work. The </p><p>telecommunications sector suffered from gross mismanagement </p><p>by the state-owned monopoly carrier, NITEL; service </p><p>delivery was poor and corruption endemic.  NITEL </p><p>had invested in expensive capital  projects </p><p>which failed to expand network capabilities, </p><p>increased operating costs, and proved incapable of </p><p>collecting its bills.  The Abubakar transitional government </p><p>of 1998-99 decreed NITEL would be subject to competition in </p><p>the telecom sector and the Obasanjo government (1999 to </p><p>date) accelerated telecom liberalization.  The NCC, though </p><p>hampered by a lack of regulatory authority over NITEL, has </p><p>emerged as an effective regulatory body by regulating the </p><p>new competition.  It has won the confidence of the local </p><p>and international business community and has begun to </p><p>protect consumer interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NCC Goes from Potemkin Agency to Promote Telecom Growth </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The United States, through USAID, has played an advisory </p><p>role with the NCC and other telecom entities as Nigeria </p><p>works toward effective regulation of the telecommunications </p><p>sector.  Thanks to that assistance, the NCC has established </p><p>clear objectives: a) increased teledensity  (telephones per </p><p>person); b) increased geographic spread of Nigeria\'s public </p><p>and private telephone network; and c) enhanced </p><p>telecommunications access in Nigeria\'s agricultural </p><p>communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The Government of Nigeria (GON) established the Nigerian </p><p>Communications Commission (NCC) as the telecommunications </p><p>regulatory authority in 1992.  This was one of the reforms </p><p>that then Head of State Ibrahim Babangida instituted as </p><p>part of his putative transition to democracy.  While the </p><p>establishment of the NCC should have signaled the </p><p>liberalization of the communications industry, it in fact </p><p>made almost no impact.  The NCC was understaffed, without </p><p>any authority over NITEL, dominated by a Ministry of </p><p>Communications rife with corruption.  Much of the NCC\'s </p><p>authority in licensing and control of the broadcast </p><p>spectrum was contested by the Nigerian Broadcasting </p><p>Commission (NBC).  Furthermore, the promised award of </p><p>broadcast and frequency licenses to private sector </p><p>companies was delayed throughout the Abacha period (1993- </p><p>1998). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  In 1998, transitional Head of State Abdulsalami </p><p>Abubakar issued a decree that revoked those legislative </p><p>obstacles to telecommunications competition.  He also </p><p>released the first (and to date largest) group of private </p><p>television and radio broadcast licenses.  The newly elected </p><p>Obasanjo government followed up on these earlier reforms </p><p>and by early 2000, targeted improvements in </p><p>telecommunications as a major "democracy dividend."  A </p><p>critical decision made the NCC the preeminent agency for </p><p>telecommunications and Obasanjo lured Engineer Ernest </p><p>Ndukwe away from the private sector to become the NCC\'s </p><p>Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NCC Objectives and Accomplishments </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The major objectives of the NCC are to: </p><p>-     Create a regulatory environment for the supply of </p><p>telecommunication services and facilities and the </p><p>promotion of fair competition and efficient market </p><p>conduct; </p><p>- Facilitate entry into markets for telecommunication </p><p>services and facilities of persons and organizations </p><p>wishing to supply such services; </p><p>- Protect licensees and the public from unfair conduct </p><p>of service providers with regard to service quality </p><p>and payment of tariffs; </p><p>- Promote the development of the telecommunication </p><p>sector of the Nigerian economy; and, </p><p>- Establish technical standards and promote the </p><p>development of Nigerian telecommunication </p><p>capabilities, industries, and skills. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. NCC achievements to date are: </p><p>- The GSM cellular auction in January 2001, described </p><p>by observers as the best-run in Africa, raised USD </p><p>855 million for the government budget and licensed </p><p>3 national digital cellular operators; </p><p>- Fixed wireless local loop licenses were auctioned </p><p>for all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory </p><p>(Abuja), raising $11.3 million; </p><p>- A second national operator (Globacom, Limited) was </p><p>licensed in August 2002, raising $200 million; </p><p>- Competition was increased by licensing 29 private </p><p>networks; </p><p>- Twenty-seven licenses for the provision and </p><p>operation of community telecommunications were </p><p>issued; </p><p>- Two licenses for the provision and operation of </p><p>national long distance communication were issued; </p><p>- One license for global mobile personal </p><p>communications by satellite was issued; </p><p>- Establishment of the consumer affairs bureau which </p><p>increased protection of consumer interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Telecommunication Reform as a Democracy Dividend </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Changes in the telecom sector have been dramatic.  NCC </p><p>actions have made possible increased cellular coverage from </p><p>25,000 lines to over 1.2 million within the first year, </p><p>with a corresponding increase in mobile teledensity from </p><p>0.04 telephone lines per hundred persons to 1.7 lines per </p><p>hundred persons.  This is a more than forty-fold increase </p><p>in the number of lines.  NCC actions have also generated </p><p>more than US $70 million a month in revenue for the </p><p>cellular companies.  Another sign of the NCC\'s growing </p><p>success is the GON decision to transfer management of </p><p>commercial frequencies from the Ministry of Communications </p><p>to NCC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Nonetheless, the NCC has had its failures.  Unable to </p><p>regulate NITEL (except in GSM cellular communications for </p><p>which NITEL had to apply to the NCC to get a license), the </p><p>NCC has not resolved interconnection problems of cost and </p><p>inoperability.  This has compelled many users, particularly </p><p>business people to have with them at all times a NITEL land </p><p>line, an Econet or MTN GSM phone, and a fixed wireless </p><p>phone as back-up to the unreliable NITEL land line. NITEL </p><p>has limited interconnection for ECONET and MTN to 10,000 </p><p>lines--though some complain that the number is really </p><p>lower--and has the highest interconnection costs in the </p><p>world. (These are reported as high as 65 Naira per minute </p><p>though a final rate is yet to be agreed between NITEL and </p><p>GSM providers.)  It is also generally believed that NITEL </p><p>favors its own GSM service for connection to landlines, and </p><p>in fact uses this as a major selling point.  The expense of </p><p>GSM tariffs has meant most Nigerians cannot afford them, </p><p>and many who buy the line and handset must sparingly use </p><p>the pay-as-you-go service.  GSM service is still limited to </p><p>major urban centers although as prices come down, the </p><p>service is becoming increasingly affordable to lower-income </p><p>users. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USG Projects in Support of Nigerian Telecom Expansion </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. USG assistance to the NCC has been led by USAID </p><p>Nigeria working through the Leland Initiative and Telecom </p><p>Leadership Program, providing support through a series of </p><p>capacity-building and technical assistance programs dating </p><p>from the arrival of Vice Chairman Ndukwe at the NCC.   Key </p><p>partners in this process include the FCC, National </p><p>Telecommunications Cooperative Association (NTCA), the </p><p>National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, </p><p>the Public Service Commissions of the District of Columbia </p><p>and Oregon and the Center to Bridge the Digital Divide at </p><p>Washington State University.  The Trade and Development </p><p>Agency (TDA) has also provided funds for a spectrum survey </p><p>and analysis of secondary wired backbones and the Embassy\'s </p><p>Public Affairs Section, using Education for Development and </p><p>Democracy Initiative (EDDI) funds, has established an </p><p>office (the Nigerian-American Information Initiative- NAII) </p><p>to publicize bilateral cooperation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  USAID projects included policy workshops at Afrinet </p><p>2000 and 2002 on licensing, interconnection, e-commerce and </p><p>rural access; consultations between key FCC leadership and </p><p>senior NCC staff; support for NCTA planning for community- </p><p>based telecommunications licensing; training in the U.S. </p><p>and Nigeria on pro-competition policy for NCC commissioners </p><p>and senior staff; technical assistance in drafting a model </p><p>code of regulations; and  staff training in consumer </p><p>affairs, licensing, policy and planning, and spectrum </p><p>pricing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. USG assistance projects have produced concrete results. </p><p>The NCC Consumer Bureau, modeled on that of the FCC, is </p><p>functional and providing the regulatory body with for </p><p>improving service.  As it becomes more effective, the </p><p>Consumer Bureau should increase transparency and enhance </p><p>consumer protection.  The NCC published and made publicly </p><p>available it regulatory code, another significant step in </p><p>increasing transparency and predictability for the </p><p>investment climate.  The USG has involved the NCC from the </p><p>beginning in plans for the West African Telecommunications </p><p>Regulators Association (WATRA) which was formally chartered </p><p>in November 2002. The NCC will host the first Annual </p><p>General Meeting in Abuja in March, 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. USAID plans to build on the leadership of the NCC, and </p><p>will extend its engagement to additional public and private </p><p>sector entities.  Major new initiatives include: </p><p>a) Effective regulation: USAID will continue its technical </p><p>assistance based on requests from the NCC to strengthen </p><p>the NCC\'s capacity for effective regulation.  Priority </p><p>areas are: strategic planning, market analysis, spectrum </p><p>pricing, tariff principles and practices, regulatory </p><p>accounting, and training for judges and legislators on </p><p>legal issues related to Telecoms. </p><p>b) African Telecoms Institute:  The NCC has acquired a </p><p>building and initiated plans for a state of the art </p><p>facility for training using traditional and on-line </p><p>distance technologies.   USAID will assist the NCC to </p><p>conduct a feasibility study and support to bring in non- </p><p>traditional and private sector partners.  USAID will also </p><p>bring the NCC and other Nigerian partners into </p><p>nettel@africa (the Network for Capacity Building and </p><p>Knowledge Exchange).  Nettel components include an </p><p>extensive training program on ICT policy and regulation. </p><p>Peer-to-peer exchange programs between Africa and the </p><p>U.S. regulatory entities, and a research program to </p><p>develop case studies that look at performance in the </p><p>telecommunication sector are other elements of future </p><p>assistance. </p><p>c) Rural Access: Technical assistance will be provided </p><p>through the NTCA to prepare community-based operators for </p><p>licensing and identification of sources of capital, </p><p>including oil companies, other industries and Nigerians </p><p>living abroad. NCC plans that leverage existing Universal </p><p>Service Funds to provide greater access to capital will </p><p>also be supported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  Comment: The Global Development Alliance (GDA) put </p><p>together for Nigerian telecommunications exemplifies the </p><p>development model recently praised by Secretary of State </p><p>Powell and USAID Administrator Natsios.  USG assistance to </p><p>the telecommunications sector in Nigeria brings together </p><p>new partners, new models and new resources to enhance the </p><p>sector and its role in development.  As a result non-USG </p><p>resources have exceeded the financial and human resources </p><p>provided by USAID and other USG agencies.  Exciting new </p><p>ways to bridge the digital telecommunication divide in </p><p>Nigeria are now being implemented.   End comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
