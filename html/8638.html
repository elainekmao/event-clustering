<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0155 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          JUNE 10, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for June 10, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete/Turkiye: Ali Keles, </p><p>the headman of Dosekkaya village in Bingol, was </p><p>kidnapped from his home by a group of eight </p><p>PKK/KADEK militants and killed in the countryside </p><p>last night. The security forces established </p><p>contact with a group of PKK/KADEK members near </p><p>Bingol yesterday, but militants, taking the </p><p>advantage of the forest and darkness, vanished in </p><p>the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Turkiye: The security forces found weapons </p><p>and ammunition in the terrorist organization\'s </p><p>shelters in Hakkari. The governor\'s office </p><p>disclosed that two Kalashnikov weapons, five </p><p>drums for those weapons, one Maouser weapon, two </p><p>backpacks, and one pair of binoculars that </p><p>belonged to PKK/KADEK militants were seized. A </p><p>large- scale operation is continuing in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Milliyet: In Adilcevaz, a coastal township </p><p>near Lake Van, jandarma arrested forty-one </p><p>Pakistanis and twelve Afghans who illegally </p><p>entered Turkey from Baskale township of Van. </p><p>During their interrogations, the Pakistanis said </p><p>they paid three thousand USD for smugglers to </p><p>Greece via Istanbul. They said they sailed Lake </p><p>Van and later, were dropped at Adilcevaz and told </p><p>they had arrived in Greece. The Afghans said they </p><p>paid seven hundred USD per person to be smuggled </p><p>into Greece. The fugitives were expelled from the </p><p>border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Evrensel: An interview with people from </p><p>different walks of life in Sanliurfa revealed </p><p>that people are expecting a general amnesty </p><p>rather than a repent law from the government to </p><p>solve the Kurdish issue. The interviewers </p><p>expressed that the repent law would deepen the </p><p>Kurdish question, and the reconciliation could be </p><p>realized only by declaring a non-discriminatory </p><p>general amnesty. They also added that the views </p><p>of all the Turkish governments about the Kurds </p><p>was the same, and emphasized that the governments </p><p>should change their mentality toward the Kurds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Bolge/Turkiye: Based on a tip, jandarma at </p><p>Incirlik found two grams of powdered hemp in the </p><p>glove compartment of the car of a US citizen, </p><p>Ursula Fara Tyson, who works as a teacher at the </p><p>base. Mrs. Tyson had notified the prosecutor\'s </p><p>office on May 27 that her husband, Orcan </p><p>Fikridanis, who does not want to divorce her, was </p><p>going place drugs in her car, and he should be </p><p>held responsible for anything that would happen </p><p>to her. During her interrogation at jandarma, </p><p>Mrs. Tyson said she had filed a petition with the </p><p>court to divorce her husband. She said her </p><p>husband constantly threatened her by stating he </p><p>would place drugs in her car and house so that </p><p>she would not divorce him. Mrs. Tyson was taken </p><p>to the court after the interrogation. The court </p><p>released Mrs. Tyson but started an investigation </p><p>on Fikridanis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Milliyet/Tercuman: The Micro-credit Project </p><p>initiated by Grameen Bank in Bengal will be </p><p>applied in Elibol village of Diyarbakir on June </p><p>11. The project is known as the "poor peoples\' </p><p>bank." The bank will give unlimited loans to </p><p>villagers establishing their own businesses </p><p>without requiring a letter of credit or </p><p>guarantor. The reimbursement of the loan will be </p><p>made weekly. Regarding the issue, Aziz Akgul, a </p><p>member of parliament (MP) from Diyarbakir, said </p><p>they would take the credit to the villagers and </p><p>would also take into account the people on the </p><p>Social Assistance and Solidarity Foundation\'s </p><p>Incentive Fund\'s list for determining who would </p><p>qualify for the loan. Akgul said there was a </p><p>great demand from Istanbul for the loans, and </p><p>thirty-two sub-governors from Istanbul attended </p><p>the bank\'s meeting there yesterday. MP Akgul said </p><p>they have already raised forty thousand USD for </p><p>the project in Diyarbakir, and that a foundation </p><p>wanted to contribute three hundred thousand USD </p><p>to the fund. Akgul said they would start the </p><p>project in Siirt, Trabzon, Agri, and Istanbul </p><p>after Diyarbakir. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
