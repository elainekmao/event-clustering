<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 03471 </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINS, PGOV, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: WHY HAS THE FARC DECLARED A UNILATERAL TRUCE? </p><p> </p><p>REF: BOGOTA 3191 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: THE FARC\'S CEASEFIRE ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 28 (REFTEL) HIGHLIGHTED THAT GROUP\'S ONGOING </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO PRESSURE THE GOC INTO DECLARING ITS OWN </p><p>CEASEFIRE AND FORCE IT INTO ENGAGING IN PEACE TALKS WITH </p><p>ALL FOUR GUERRILLA GROUPS IN THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA </p><p>COORDINATOR (SBGC).  THE FARC STRATEGY STEMS FROM </p><p>POLITICAL AS WELL AS MILITARY IMPERATIVES.  THE GOC IS </p><p>NOT BUYING IT.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>THE FARC PLOY; THE GOC RESPONSE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2.  THE FARC WANTS THE GOC TO CALL OFF THE TROOPS AND </p><p>ENGAGE IN PEACE TALKS WITH THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA </p><p>COORDINATOR (SBGC).  ITS DECISION TO DECLARE A </p><p>UNILATERAL TRUCE FOLLOWING THE APPOINTMENT OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION OF NOTABLES IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE </p><p>THAT GOAL, AS IS ITS LATEST TACTIC OF SENDING A LETTER </p><p>TO THE PRESIDENTS OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT IN HOPES OF </p><p>ENLISTING THEIR SUPPORT TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON BARCO TO </p><p>OPEN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SBGC.  THE GOC HAS REFUSED TO </p><p>BE PRESSURED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE GUERRILLA STRATEGY TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT INTO </p><p>DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS HAS BEEN EVIDENT SINCE AT LEAST MID </p><p>1988, WHEN THE M-19 FORCED THE CREATION OF THE COMMITTEE </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE AS THE PRICE FOR THE RELEASE </p><p>OF ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO.  THE GOC SUCCESSFULLY WITHSTOOD </p><p>THE M-19 PLOY AND THEN BEGAN A MORE PLANNED APPROACH OF </p><p>ITS OWN TO REGAIN POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE PEACE ISSUE. </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1988, THE GOC CODIFIED AND PUBLICLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED THE POLICY IT HAD IN ESSENCE BEEN FOLLOWING </p><p>SINCE BARCO CAME INTO OFFICE IN AUGUST 1986; TO WIT: WE </p><p>WILL NOT TALK FOR THE SAKE OF TALK (IMPLICATION -- AS </p><p>BETANCUR DID), BUT MUST DEMAND PROOF BY WORD AND DEED </p><p>THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING PEACE. </p><p>ONCE THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WE WILL TALK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE GOC IS TALKING WITH THE M-19 BECAUSE THAT GROUP </p><p>DECLARED ITS TRUCE OVER SIX MONTHS AGO.  THIS, COMBINED </p><p>WITH THE GOC\'S DESIRE TO SHOW THAT ITS PEACE PLAN WILL </p><p>WORK, MOTIVATED THE GOVERNMENT TO UNDERTAKE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WITH THE M-19.  THE GOC FEELS UNDER NO PRESSURE TO RUSH </p><p>INTO TALKS WITH THE FARC AND CAN POINT TO ITS TRACK </p><p>RECORD VIS A VIS THE M19 TO DEFEND ITS POSITION. </p><p>RAFAEL PARDO TOLD THE PRESS IN MEXICO MARCH 4 THAT "THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AGREES WITH DIRECT PEACE TALKS WITH THE </p><p>GUERRILLA.  IT INITIATED THEM IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR </p><p>WITH THE M-19 BECAUSE THAT GROUP HAD DEMONSTRATED OVER </p><p>THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS A SINCERE DESIRE FOR PEACE.  THE </p><p>FARC DECLARED ITS TRUCE ONE WEEK AGO.  WE HAVE NOTHING </p><p>AGAINST SUCH A DECLARATION, BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT </p><p>GOING TO INITIATE ANY DIALOGUE WITH ANY GUERRILLA </p><p>ORGANIZATION IF IT CONTINUES ITS TERRORISM, KIDNAPPINGS, </p><p>AMBUSHES AND EXTORTION."  IN ESSENCE, THE GOVERNMENT CAN </p><p>SIT BACK AND WAIT TO SEE IF THE FARC COMPLIES WITH ITS </p><p>PROMISE TO END HOSTILITIES, INCLUDING EXTORTION. </p><p> </p><p>THE MILITARY MOTIVATION </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5.  IT APPEARS THAT THE FARC DECLARATION OF A UNILATERAL </p><p>CEASEFIRE HAD ROOTS IN MILITARY EVENTS AS WELL. </p><p>MILITARY SOURCES SPECULATE THAT THE FARC WAS HURT WHEN </p><p>IT LOST AN IMPORTANT ARMS SHIPMENT IN JANUARY (SEE </p><p>BOGOTA 315) AND, IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS, HAS INCURRED </p><p>MORE CASUALTIES THAN EXPECTED.  IN ADDITION, CAMPESINOS </p><p>IN KEY AREAS HAVE BEGUN SUPPORTING THE ARMY AND ITS </p><p>ANTI-SUBVERSIVE OPERATIONS MORE THAN IN THE PAST -- AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL SETBACK TO THE FARC. </p><p> </p><p>6.  DEFENSE ATTACHE CONTACTS IN THE ARMED FORCES BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE FARC\'S CEASEFIRE AND ITS INSISTENCE ON DIALOGUE </p><p>WITHOUT DISARMAMENT IS A POLITICAL PLOY TO GAIN "TIME </p><p>AND SPACE" TO BUILD UP THEIR FORCES.  ACCORDING TO THEM, </p><p>1989 IS A CRITICAL YEAR FOR THE FARC, ONE IN WHICH IT </p><p>HOPES TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD LEAD TO </p><p>"GENERAL INSURRECTION" IN 1990.  THESE SOURCES SHARE </p><p>PRESIDENT BARCO\'S SUSPICIONS (REFTEL, PARA. 4) THAT THE </p><p>FARC IS USING THE TRUCE AND PEACE DIALOGUE AS PRETEXTS </p><p>TO GAIN A BREATHING SPELL AND COME BACK STRONGER IN LATE </p><p>1989. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN CONCLUSION, THE ONUS IS ON THE FARC TO PROVE IT </p><p>IS SERIOUS ABOUT PEACE.  FARC LEADERS WILL LIKELY FIND </p><p>IT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THEIR SPREAD OUT AND </p><p>DECENTRALIZED FRONTS, ESPECIALLY PREVENTING THEM FROM </p><p>CARRYING OUT THEIR NORMAL "TAX" COLLECTIONS.  IF THE </p><p>FARC CAN MAINTAIN THE CEASEFIRE, PRESSURE WILL MOUNT ON </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TO OPEN TALKS.  IF IT CANNOT, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL BE FREE TO PURSUE ITS CURRENT PEACE PLAN </p><p>WHILE KEEPING THE MILITARY PRESSURE ON THE FARC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCNAMARA </p><p></p></div>
