<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Africa must resist West\'s </p><p>      machinations" the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      dedicated its July 3 editorial to accusing Washington of </p><p>      conspiring to unseat Robert Mugabe and his government. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .Mr. Bush\'s African visit. . .seems to have </p><p>      renewed the puppet (opposition Movement for </p><p>      Democratic Change ) party\'s false hopes of entering </p><p>      State House through the backdoor. . .America, which </p><p>      claims to be the champion of democracy, is calling </p><p>      for the toppling of the constitutionally elected </p><p>      government of Zimbabwe. . .Is the violent removal of </p><p>      a democratically elected government not terrorism of </p><p>      the worst kind?  America claims to be fighting </p><p>      terrorism on one hand and openly declaring </p><p>      intentions to topple legitimately elected </p><p>      governments on the other.  The world has had enough </p><p>      of these double standards.  We salute the position </p><p>      taken by Botswana and Zambia that the two </p><p>      neighboring countries would not allow their </p><p>      countries to be used as launch pads by the </p><p>      blood-thirsty America in its bid to effect regime </p><p>      change in Zimbabwe.  For how long should America be </p><p>      left to abuse its superiority and bully other </p><p>      nations with impunity?" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
