<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002899 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: 1999 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 204472 </p><p> </p><p>1.   THE FOLLOWING IS POST\'S RESPONSE TO REFTEL </p><p>REQUESTING INPUT FOR THE DEPARTMENT\'S 1999 ANNUAL </p><p>TERRORISM REPORT.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA (GSL) </p><p>CONTINUED TO BATTLE THE SEPARATIST LIBERATION TIGERS OF </p><p>TAMIL EELAM (LTTE), THE ONLY TERRORIST GROUP CURRENTLY </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE ACTIVE IN SRI LANKA.  ON OCTOBER 8, THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT RE-DESIGNATED THE LTTE AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE ANTI-TERRORISM AND </p><p>EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF 1996.  THROUGHOUT 1999 THE </p><p>GSL CONTINUED MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST THE LTTE.  A </p><p>SERIES OF OFFENSIVES BEGINNING IN MARCH AND A </p><p>COUNTEROFFENSIVE BY THE LTTE IN NOVEMBER LED TO SEVERAL </p><p>THOUSAND CASUALTIES FROM BOTH GROUPS.  LTTE TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES CONTINUED DURING THE YEAR, WITH, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>THE ASSASSINATION BY THE LTTE ON JULY 29 OF MODERATE </p><p>TAMIL POLITICIAN DR. NEELAN TIRUCHELVAM, THE SEPTEMBER 18 </p><p>KILLING OF MORE THAN FIFTY CIVILIANS IN THE AMPARAI </p><p>DISTRICT IN RETALIATION FOR A SRI LANKAN AIR FORCE ATTACK </p><p>IN THE NORTH, AND THE SEPTEMBER HIJACKING OF A CHINESE </p><p>VESSEL WHICH HAD COME TOO CLOSE TO THE SRI LANKAN </p><p>COASTLINE. </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS A THROUGH </p><p>K IN PAR-A 3 OF REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (A) THERE WERE NO GSL PROSECUTIONS OF PEOPLE </p><p>INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS </p><p>OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  MANY SUSPECTED MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>LTTE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND DETAINED UNDER THE EMERGENCY </p><p>REGULATIONS AND THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT AND SOME </p><p>HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH RELATIVELY MINOR OFFENSES SUCH AS </p><p>WITHHOLDING INFORMATION.  NO IMPORTANT LTTE LEADER HAS </p><p>EVER BEEN APPREHENDED AND PROSECUTED.  LTTE HEAD </p><p>VELUPILLAI PRABHAKARAN AND NINE OTHER LTTE MEMBERS REMAIN </p><p>INDICTED FOR COMPLICITY IN THE JANUARY 1996 CENTRAL BANK </p><p>BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>(B)  THE GSL DID NOT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION </p><p>OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR. </p><p>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DID NOT REQUEST ANY EXTRADITIONS OR </p><p>ASK FOR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES.  IN JUNE 1995, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF INDIA REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF LTTE </p><p>HEAD PRABHAKARAN AND TWO OTHER SENIOR LTTE MEMBERS </p><p>(INTELLIGENCE CHIEF POTTU AMMAN AND WOMEN\'S WING LEADER </p><p>AKILA, THE LATTER OF WHOM IS NOW BELIEVED DEAD) FOR THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF RAJIV GANDHI.  EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS </p><p>HAVE NOT BEGUN, AND IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THESE LTTE LEADERS </p><p>WILL BE APPREHENDED IN ANY EVENT. </p><p> </p><p>(C)  POST IS AWARE OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO GSL </p><p>PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p>IN FACT, EXTRADITION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND SRI LANKA WAS </p><p>FACILITATED BY THE SEPTEMBER 30 SIGNING OF A GENERAL </p><p>EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, REPLACING A </p><p>1932 TREATY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND UK, THE THEN COLONIAL </p><p>POWER.  TERRORISM IS ILLEGAL UNDER THE PREVENTION OF </p><p>TERRORISM ACT.  SRI LANKAN EXTRADITION LAW PERMITS </p><p>EXTRADITION OF INDIVIDUALS TO OTHER COMMONWEALTH </p><p>COUNTRIES.  MOREOVER, SRI LANKA IS A SIGNATORY TO THE </p><p>1988 SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>(SAARC) REGIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF </p><p>TERRORISM, WHICH DESIGNATES CERTAIN ACTS SPECIFICALLY AS </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS AND NOT AS POLITICAL ACTS, THEREBY </p><p>NULLIFYING ATTEMPTS BY TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS TO CLAIM </p><p>POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS FOR VIOLENCE.  THE GSL THEREFORE </p><p>SEEMS OBLIGED TO COOPERATE WITH THE REQUESTS FROM INDIA </p><p>FOR THE EXTRADITION OF PRABHAKARAN AND POTTU AMMAN, </p><p>THOUGH IT IS LIKELY THAT ITS OWN PROSECUTION WOULD TAKE </p><p>PRECEDENCE -- ESPECIALLY NOW PRABHAKARAN HAS ACTUALLY </p><p>BEEN INDICTED FOR A TERRORIST ACT. </p><p> </p><p>(D)  ITSELF A TARGET OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, THE GSL </p><p>HAS BEEN STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF TERRORISM.  THE GSL COOPERATED </p><p>FULLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IN ITS INVESTIGATION </p><p>OF THE RAJIV GANDHI ASSASSINATION.  SRI LANKA HAS BEEN </p><p>QUICK TO CONDEMN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS IN OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES, IS A SIGNATORY TO THE TOKYO, THE HAGUE AND </p><p>MONTREAL CONVENTIONS AGAINST TERRORISM, AND HAS PASSED </p><p>THE NECESSARY ENABLING LEGISLATION FOR ALL THREE </p><p>PROTOCOLS. </p><p> </p><p>(E)  THE GSL IS CONDUCTING ONGOING COUNTER-TERRORIST AND </p><p>COUNTER-INSURGENCY OPERATIONS AGAINST THE LTTE, INCLUDING </p><p>MILITARY ACTIONS AND SPECIAL MEASURES TO PROTECT URBAN </p><p>AREAS, IMPORTANT INSTALLATIONS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS. </p><p>THESE ARE AIMED AT WEAKENING THE LTTE AND INHIBITING ITS </p><p>ABILITY TO CONDUCT TERRORIST ATTACKS AS WELL AS MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS.  THE GSL ADDRESSED TERRORISM ISSUES THIS YEAR </p><p>IN SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL FORA INCLUDING THE UNGA IN NEW </p><p>YORK (WHERE IT TOOK A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN DRAFTING THE </p><p>RECENT CONVENTION RESTRICTING FINANCING OF TERRORISM) AND </p><p>THE UNHRC IN GENEVA. </p><p> </p><p>(F)   THE GSL DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>(G)   THE GSL HAS MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p>HOWEVER, IT HAS NOT ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION OF THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>LIBYA, IRAQ, IRAN AND SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>(H)  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN 1999.  THE GSL VIEWS THE </p><p>CONTINUING USG DESIGNATION OF THE LTTE AS A FOREIGN </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN ITS </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS.  THE USG DESIGNATION HAS </p><p>ENCOURAGED THE GSL TO MAINTAIN ITS APPROACH TO COMBATING </p><p>TERRORISM BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.  THE GSL </p><p>USES THE U.S. DESIGNATION TO URGE OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH </p><p>AS THE UK, TO RESTRICT THE LTTE LIKEWISE. </p><p> </p><p>(I)  THE GSL HAS ACCEPTED THE U.S. OFFER OF INCREASED </p><p>ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM </p><p>(ATA).  IN 1999, NINETEEN SRI LANKAN SECURITY FORCES </p><p>PERSONNEL WERE TO TAKE PART IN A SENIOR CRISIS MANAGEMENT </p><p>SEMINAR UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  DUE TO REVERSES IN THE WAR, </p><p>HOWEVER, SRI LANKA CANCELLED ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>EVENT.  IN 1998, SRI LANKAN SECURITY FORCES PERSONNEL </p><p>TOOK PART IN SEPARATE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN EXPLOSIVE </p><p>INCIDENT COUNTERMEASURES, VITAL INSTALLATION SECURITY, </p><p>AND POST-BLAST INVESTIGATION.  THE GSL HELPED DRAFT AND </p><p>WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY TO SIGN THE INTERNATIONAL PROTOCOL </p><p>AGAINST BOMBING AT THE UN IN JANUARY 1998 (THE USG SIGNED </p><p>SECOND).  IN 1997, SRI LANKA RATIFIED THE 1988 PROTOCOL </p><p>FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF UNLAWFUL ACTS OF VIOLENCE AT </p><p>AIRPORTS SERVING INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, IT IS EITHER A SIGNATORY, OR HAS TAKEN THE </p><p>NECESSARY INTERNAL STEPS TO BECOME A SIGNATORY, TO THE </p><p>1979 CONVENTION AGAINST THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES, AND THE </p><p>1979 CONVENTION ON THE PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF NUCLEAR </p><p>MATERIALS.  THOUGH THE GSL HAS YET TO RATIFY THE 1991 </p><p>CONVENTION OF THE MARKING OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES FOR THE </p><p>PURPOSES OF DETECTION, AND THE 1988 CONVENTION FOR THE </p><p>SUPPRESSION OF UNLAWFUL ACTS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF </p><p>MARITIME NAVIGATION, THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE GSL IS RECEPTIVE TO BECOMING A </p><p>SIGNATORY. </p><p> </p><p>(J-1) THE GSL HAS COOPERATED FULLY WITH U.S. OFFICIALS </p><p>INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF U.S. LAW BY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>(J2) THERE HAVE BEEN NO CONFIRMED CASES OF TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>DIRECTED AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS IN SRI LANKA. </p><p> </p><p>(K)  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SEVERAL REQUESTS TO THE </p><p>GSL FOR ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES FOR U.S. PERSONNEL </p><p>AND FACILITIES IN SRI LANKA.  ALL REQUESTS HAVE BEEN MET </p><p>EXPEDITIOUSLY BY THE GSL.  THESE REQUESTS WERE MADE TO </p><p>ENHANCE SECURITY IN GENERAL AND NOT IN RESPONSE TO ANY </p><p>IDENTIFIABLE THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>DONNELLY </p><p></p></div>
