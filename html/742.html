<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 002189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE - CHRIS HOH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 6/7/05 </p><p>TAGS: War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL-INFORMAL NO. 7 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SAKIC RUMOR: (FOR CHRIS HOH FROM RICK HOLTZAPPLE) I </p><p>HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH CICAK TO SEE WHAT HE HAS </p><p>HEARD, BUT I ASKED SLAVKO GOLDSTEIN (A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>CROATIAN HELSINKI COMMITTEE\'S BOARD, A CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF </p><p>CICAK, AND A PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE ZAGREB JEWISH </p><p>COMMUNITY) IF HE HAD HEARD ANY RUMORS THAT SAKIC HAD </p><p>SURFACED IN CROATIA.  GOLDSTEIN SAID HE HAD NOT HEARD ANY </p><p>SUCH RUMORS, AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD THEM IF THEY </p><p>WERE CIRCULATING IN ZAGREB.  (NOTE: IF CICAK WERE </p><p>SPREADING THESE RUMORS, GOLDSTEIN WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY </p><p>HAVE HEARD THEM.) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02189  071609Z </p><p>3.  GOLDSTEIN, AND OTHERS I ASKED WHO FOLLOW THE PRESS </p><p>CLOSELY, RECALLED THAT SAKIC GAVE AN INTERVIEW IN BUENOS </p><p>AIRES TO A LOCAL JOURNALIST WHO ACCOMPANIED TUDJMAN ON HIS </p><p>TRIP TO ARGENTINA A FEW MONTHS BACK.  (I GATHER SAKIC IS </p><p>NOT EXACTLY IN HIDING IN ARGENTINA; HE CLAIMS HE HAS </p><p>POWERFUL FRIENDS IN THE ARMY AND LEGISLATURE.)  IN THAT </p><p>INTERVIEW, SAKIC SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO VISIT CROATIA, </p><p>BUT THAT HE KNEW IT WOULD BE AN IMPOLITIC THING TO DO, </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS PAST.  BUT SAKIC SAID, "I HOPE THAT THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR I WILL BE ABLE TO COME AND STAY. </p><p>WE WILL SEE."  GOLDSTEIN SAID HE ALSO VAGUELY RECALLED A </p><p>SUBSEQUENT PRESS REPORT OF AN (UNCONFIRMED) COMMENT BY </p><p>CROATIAN HEALTH MINISTER HEBRANG THAT THERE WAS NO REASON </p><p>SAKIC SHOULD NOT TRAVEL TO CROATIA, SINCE HE HAD NEVER </p><p>BEEN CONVICTED OF WAR CRIMES.  BUT GOLDSTEIN SAID THAT </p><p>THIS COMMENT WAS AN UNOFFICIAL STATEMENT, AND HE WAS NOT </p><p>EVEN SURE HEBRANG HAD REALLY SAID IT. (NOTE: HEBRANG\'S </p><p>FATHER, A LEADING PARTISAN, WAS PART OF A PRISONER </p><p>EXCHANGE ORGANIZED BY SAKIC IN WWII.) </p><p> </p><p>4. OUR FBIS FSN ALSO TOLD ME THAT HE THOUGHT TANJUG HAD </p><p>RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SAKIC HAD COME TO ZAGREB.  POSSIBLY </p><p>THAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE RUMOR THAT SAKIC HAS NOW COME TO </p><p>ZAGREB. </p><p> </p><p>5. BY THE WAY, IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE COMMANDANT </p><p>OF JASENOVAC WAS A MAN NAMED MAX LUBURIC (WHOSE SISTER IS </p><p>MARRIED TO SAKIC), AND SAKIC WAS THE CAMP\'S DEPUTY </p><p>COMMANDER (AND CHIEF EXECUTIONER). </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02189  071609Z </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
