<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GABORONE 005064 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR AF - SCHNEIDMAN, AF/S - RENDER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SADC, EAID, KDEM, PGOV, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: STRENGTHENING MULTIPARTY DEMPOCRACY IN SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 119706, B) GABORONE 1355, C) GABORONE 5057 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  IN THE PAST YEAR SOUTHERN AFRICA HAS WITNESSED A </p><p>SERIES OF ELECTIONS.  SOME, SUCH AS THOSE IN MOZAMBIQUE, </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AND TANZANIA, HAVE BEEN HOTLY CONTESTED IN SOME </p><p>AREAS, WITH QUESTIONS RAISED AS TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS.  OTHERS, SUCH AS THOSE IN BOTSWANA, </p><p>NAMIBIA, AND MAURITIUS, HAVE BEEN GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS </p><p>MODELS OF ELECTORAL LEGITIMACY.  THE ATTENTION GIVEN TO </p><p>THESE ELECTIONS, COUPLED WITH THE EMERGENCE OF </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITIONS IN SEVERAL </p><p>COUNTRIES, HAS GIVEN RISE TO A NUMBER OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN- </p><p>LED INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE MULTI-PARTYISM AND DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PERFORMANCE IN THE REGION.  THIS PROVIDES US A UNIQUE AND </p><p>TIMELY OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THESE DEVELOPMENTS.  WE </p><p>RECOMMEND DOING SO, AND PROPOSE THAT THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>ALLOCATE $250,000 IN FY01 ESF TO HELP ESTABLISH A </p><p>PERMANENT CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE OF POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>AND TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY TRAINING INSTITUTE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  OUR REQUEST FOLLOWS THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE </p><p>"ENGINEERING DEMOCRATIC CHANGE: THE EXPERIENCE OF </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA" CONFERENCE HELD </p><p>SEPTEMBER 28-30 IN WINDHOEK USING FY00 ESF (REF C).  THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS ORGANIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF NAMIBIA, </p><p>THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WESTERN CAPE, AND THE NATIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS </p><p>(UNAM/UWC/NDI GROUP), AND WAS ATTENDED BY POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>LEADERS FROM GOVERNING AND OPPOSITION PARTIES AROUND THE </p><p>REGION.  THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS ISSUED AN EIGHT- </p><p>POINT CONSENSUS DOCUMENT THAT OUTLINES THEIR DECISION TO </p><p>FORM A CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA (CCPP) AND TO EXPLORE THE IDEA OF FORMING </p><p>A REGIONAL POLITICAL PARTY TRAINING INSTITUTE.  THE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS ALSO PROPOSED THAT THE UNAM/UWC/NDI GROUP </p><p>ORGANIZE A MEETING IN MARCH 2001 TO OFFICIALLY LAUNCH THE </p><p>CCPP AND THE INSTITUTE.  BOTH INITIATIVES WILL EMBRACE </p><p>GOVERNING AND OPPOSITION PARTY LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM, WITH THE AIM OF IMPROVING POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES\' ABILITY TO FUNCTION AS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>OUR PROPOSAL </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.   USAID\'S REGIONAL CENTER FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA (RCSA) </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN FOLLOW-ON MEETINGS WITH THE UNAM/UWC/NDI </p><p>GROUP IN CAPE TOWN ON OCTOBER 18 AND WITH UNAM IN </p><p>GABORONE ON OCTOBER 27.  THESE MEETINGS REAFFIRMED THE </p><p>GROUP\'S RESOLVE TO CARRY THE PROCESS THROUGH TO THE MARCH </p><p>2001 MEETING AND BEYOND.  WE WOULD LIKE TO BUILD ON OUR </p><p>INITIAL ESF INVESTMENT IN THIS PROCESS AND ENCOURAGE THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE OF POLITICAL PARTIES FROM THROUGHOUT THE SADC </p><p>REGION BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ESF FUNDING IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>THESE EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN REGIONAL DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PERFORMANCE.  WE PROPOSE THAT THE DEPARTMENT ALLOCATE </p><p>$250,000 IN FY01 ESF TO ALLOW RCSA TO: </p><p> </p><p>-- SUPPORT THE MARCH 2001 MEETING; </p><p> </p><p>-- ASSIST IN ESTABLISHING THE CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE OF </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE FORMALIZED AT </p><p>THAT MEETING; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- INVESTIGATE MECHANISMS FOR ESTABLISHING SUSTAINABLE </p><p>TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  OF THIS AMOUNT, WE PROPOSE THAT APPROXIMATELY </p><p>$100,000 BE USED TO SUPPORT PREPARING AND CONVENING THE </p><p>MARCH 2001 MEETING, $100,000 TO HELP TO ESTABLISH THE </p><p>CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE, AND $50,000 TO CONTRIBUTE TO </p><p>EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH THE TRAINING INSTITUTE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE UNAM/UWC/NDI GROUP\'S INITIATIVE COMES AT AN </p><p>IMPORTANT INTER-ELECTION PERIOD, WHEN ROLES AND </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GOVERNING AND OPPOSITION PARTIES </p><p>WILL BE FORMULATED AND CONSOLIDATED, AND CAN EVOLVE INTO </p><p>INFLUENTIAL, POSITIVE CODES OF CONDUCT FOR POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY ACTION DURING THE NEXT ROUND OF ELECTIONS.  THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD IN </p><p>PROMOTING DEMOCRATIC NORMS FOR POLITICAL BEHAVIOR IN </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA.  IN OUR VIEW, THE INITIATIVE HAS THE </p><p>POTENTIAL TO AMELIORATE DISCORD CAUSED BY A "WINNER-TAKE- </p><p>ALL" MENTALITY AND TO DEMONSTRATE REAL POLITICAL WILL BY </p><p>THE REGION\'S PARTY LEADERS TO WORK TOGETHER FOR THE </p><p>PUBLIC INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>DELISI </p><p></p></div>
