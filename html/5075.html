<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 000075 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. </p><p>MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 01/13/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  PEACE PROCESS UPDATE:  LTTE NEGOTIATOR SPEAKS </p><p>OUT; UN SYG ANNAN TO VISIT; FEDERALISM EXPLORED </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 01/13/03 fax </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 52, and previous (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY LEWIS AMSELEM, DEPUTY CHIEF OF </p><p>MISSION.  REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process reviews </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- LTTE negotiator Balasingham speaks out </p><p> </p><p>-- Norwegian Prime Minister responds to president\'s </p><p>charges </p><p> </p><p>-- Kofi Annan to visit in February; Japanese Special </p><p>Envoy Akashi also on the way </p><p> </p><p>-- Exploring federalism </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>LTTE NEGOTIATOR SPEAKS OUT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) senior </p><p>negotiator Anton Balasingham has received widespread </p><p>press coverage in Sri Lanka of late.  The coverage has </p><p>been generated by his remarks at the press conference </p><p>that took place after the completion of the fourth round </p><p>of talks last week and in two press interviews, one with </p><p>the BBC and one with a local paper.  Overall, </p><p>Balasingham used the three occasions to emphasize the </p><p>LTTE\'s commitment to the ongoing peace process.  On a </p><p>more negative note, he also went on to stress that the </p><p>LTTE would not consider disarming until much further </p><p>down the road.  Highlights of Balasingham\'s comments </p><p>included: </p><p> </p><p>-- BBC TV interview (telecast on January 7):  During </p><p>this interview with BBC Sri Lanka correspondent Frances </p><p>Harrison, Balasingham underscored that he did not </p><p>believe that the war would return because "both parties </p><p>are seriously committed to peace."  In response to a </p><p>question, he stressed that the Tigers had no intention </p><p>of disbanding the "Black Tiger" suicide squads at this </p><p>time, stating:  "All LTTE units are now observing the </p><p>ceasefire, but they are also the bargaining power of the </p><p>Tamil people.  We have to keep them to pressurize the </p><p>government to bring about a settlement.  When this </p><p>situation is reached, then we will consider disarming </p><p>these units." </p><p> </p><p>-- (After-the-talks) press conference (January 9):  When </p><p>queried once again on the issue of disarmament, </p><p>Balasingham replied:  "Some people are under the </p><p>impression that we are like the IRA or some other </p><p>organization which has a few weapons lying here or </p><p>there.  That is wrong.  The LTTE has a formidable </p><p>military machine, a conventional army that has fought </p><p>this war for 20 years...we will not disarm, until the </p><p>aspirations of the Tamil people are met.  (Until this </p><p>happens) disarming would be suicidal."  Balasingham went </p><p>on to deny that the Tigers were holding any Sri Lankan </p><p>military POWs or that there were any MIAs, stating </p><p>"Unfortunately, they (the Sri Lankan soldiers) all died </p><p>on the battlefield."  He estimated that 25,000 GSL </p><p>soldiers were killed in the war along with 17,500 LTTE </p><p>cadre. </p><p> </p><p>-- Interview in the SUNDAY LEADER (published </p><p>January 12):  During this interview with editor Lasantha </p><p>Wickremetunge, Balasingham underscored that the LTTE </p><p>wanted to see progress made in solving the issue of the </p><p>Sri Lankan military\'s "high security zones" in Jaffna. </p><p>The LTTE was not demanding that the GSL withdraw from </p><p>all of these security zones, but it wanted them </p><p>relocated or reduced in size.  In any case, the LTTE had </p><p>no intention to move heavy weapons into any areas that </p><p>were eventually vacated by the military.  He asserted </p><p>that the military -- as opposed to Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe\'s government -- was being "rigid" on the </p><p>security zone matter.  In response to a question, he hit </p><p>out at President Kumaratunga, asserting that the LTTE </p><p>could not work with her, remarking:  "If she </p><p>(Kumaratunga) takes power (by regaining control of the </p><p>government), I don\'t think there will be any peace </p><p>negotiations because she is committed to war."  (Note: </p><p>the text of this interview is contained in Ref A.) </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  Although he is technically spokesman </p><p>of the LTTE (among many other titles), Balasingham -- </p><p>befitting an organization that remains highly secretive </p><p>-- does not interact with the press all that much.  His </p><p>latest comments, particularly those published in the </p><p>SUNDAY LEADER, were some of the most extensive a LTTE </p><p>official has made since the peace process began, </p><p>however.  (Note:  His appearance with LTTE leader V. </p><p>Prabhakaran at a press conference in April 2001 was also </p><p>a major media event.)  In general via his comments, </p><p>Balasingham appeared to be trying to seem moderate and </p><p>to assure the south of the LTTE\'s commitment to peace. </p><p>That said, his obvious attempts to divide the south into </p><p>elements the LTTE can work with (e.g., the GSL) and </p><p>those it cannot work with (e.g., Kumaratunga/the </p><p>military) were a bit unsettling and probably too clever </p><p>by half.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>NORWEGIAN PM RESPONDS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Norwegian Prime Minister Bondevik has responded </p><p>to President Kumaratunga\'s complaints about GoN </p><p>involvement in a recent incident involving the import of </p><p>radio equipment for the LTTE.  (Note:  On January 1, </p><p>Kumaratunga sent Bondevik a letter questioning the </p><p>Norwegian role in this matter, especially the </p><p>involvement of Ambassador Jon Westborg -- see Ref B.) </p><p>In a letter dated January 6 that received front-page </p><p>coverage in the local press, the Norwegian PM noted that </p><p>the GSL had already explained the circumstances </p><p>surrounding the import of the equipment and that the GoN </p><p>did not have anything else to add to this explanation. </p><p>(Note:  PM Wickremesinghe recently sent Kumaratunga an </p><p>extensive letter explaining GSL involvement in the </p><p>matter, noting that the Norwegian embassy had only </p><p>gotten involved at the specific request of the GSL.) </p><p>Ambassador Westborg was open to briefing the president </p><p>on the matter if she wished, Bondevik noted.  The letter </p><p>went on to praise Kumaratunga\'s involvement in </p><p>initiating and supporting the peace process.  Asked </p><p>about the letter, Oddvar Laegried, DCM at the Norwegian </p><p>Embassy, told us that the letter was carefully </p><p>calibrated not to anger Kumaratunga and Norway hoped she </p><p>would put the matter behind her. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  It is possible that the controversy </p><p>over the radio equipment will come to a close with this </p><p>missive from Prime Minister Bondevik.  The letter was </p><p>drafted with the utmost care and seemed to hit all the </p><p>right notes, especially in its salutes to Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>(rather large) ego.  In the meantime, anti-peace process </p><p>elements -- and those who are merely skeptical like the </p><p>president -- seem to have wrung just about every last </p><p>bit of blood they can out of this matter.  In the </p><p>process, they seem to have scored some points on the </p><p>government and the GoN -- but not too many.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>UN SYG, GOJ SPECIAL ENVOY TO VISIT </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The Sri Lankan MFA has announced that UN </p><p>Secretary General Kofi Annan will visit Sri Lanka from </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>February 26-27.  According to UN sources, the focus of </p><p>the visit will be Sri Lanka\'s peace process, and ways to </p><p>address the humanitarian situation in the north and </p><p>east.  While plans for the visit are still being put </p><p>together, it will center around meetings with GSL </p><p>officials in Colombo.  It is also possible that a visit </p><p>to war-ravaged Jaffna will be arranged. </p><p>7.  (SBU) In another visit related to the peace process, </p><p>Japan\'s Special Envoy for Sri Lankan peace process </p><p>humanitarian issues Yasushi Akashi plans to visit, </p><p>January 15-20.  The primary reason for the visit, </p><p>according to Koji Yagi, a poloff at the Japanese </p><p>Embassy, is for Akashi to attend the "Sub-Committee on </p><p>Immediate Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs" (SIHRN) </p><p>meeting being held in the LTTE-controlled Wanni region. </p><p>(Note:  Akashi is acting as principal advisor to the </p><p>sub-committee, which was formed at the second round of </p><p>GSL-LTTE talks in November.)  According to press </p><p>reports, Akashi may meet with LTTE leader Prabhakaran </p><p>during his stop in the Wanni, but Yagi said he did not </p><p>think that Akashi would be participating in any such </p><p>meeting.  Akashi is also planning to visit sites in </p><p>southern Sri Lanka.   (Note:  Akashi is scheduled to </p><p>meet Ambassador Wills on January 17.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  Annan\'s visit will be the first by a </p><p>UN SYG since U Thant\'s in 1967.  With the GSL\'s peace </p><p>initiative now over a year old, Annan clearly wants to </p><p>try to reinforce the process to the full extent </p><p>possible.  It will be interesting to see who in the LTTE </p><p>he might meet with, if anyone.  As for Akashi, as </p><p>mentioned in Ref B, Japan has been trying to play a more </p><p>important role in Sri Lanka\'s peace process for some </p><p>time.  FM Kawaguchi\'s recent visit to Sri Lanka fit into </p><p>that mold, as does Akashi\'s involvement.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>EXPLORING FEDERALISM </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) In an effort to increase understanding of </p><p>federalist models of government, a German NGO called </p><p>"PeaceTalk" has invited ten Sri Lankans on a ten-day </p><p>tour of Italy, Austria, Germany, and Belgium.  (Note: </p><p>Mission is trying to find out more information about </p><p>this NGO.)  Representatives of most major parties in the </p><p>south, including the governing United National Party and </p><p>the opposition People\'s Alliance, are reportedly slated </p><p>to participate in the study, as is the LTTE.  The </p><p>radical, Sinhalese extremist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) has reportedly turned down an invitation to </p><p>participate.  Gajan Ponnambalam, a Tamil National </p><p>Alliance MP who plans to join the study tour, told us </p><p>that the primary focus of the trip would be ways to </p><p>apply federalist models to the Sri Lankan situation. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Once extremely controversial, </p><p>federalism is now clearly a growth business in Sri </p><p>Lanka.  Since the LTTE announced at the third round of </p><p>talks in December that it was willing to explore </p><p>federalist options, numerous NGOs have offered to work </p><p>with the two sides in developing ideas on this issue. </p><p>(Note:  Essentially the issue under discussion is the </p><p>Sri Lankan constitution, which is unitary in structure, </p><p>and would need to be revamped or rewritten to allow some </p><p>sort of federalist structure to emerge.)  The study tour </p><p>to Europe is part of this general educational effort, as </p><p>was a conference held in December in Switzerland </p><p>sponsored by a Swiss NGO.  We also understand that at </p><p>the recently concluded fourth round of talks there were </p><p>many meetings on the margins on this topic, including </p><p>some involving the Forum of Federations, a Canadian NGO. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
