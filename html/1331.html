(C) AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF (NOTETAKER), </p><p>MET SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA NOVEMBER 1 </p><p>TO CONVEY USG CONCERN OVER RECENT REPORTS OF ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN NEW FIGHTING IN THE DRC.  MNANGAGWA, WHO </p><p>IS STILL ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN MANAGING ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS IN THE DRC, PROFESSED </p><p>IGNORANCE OF AN OFFENSIVE BY FAC FORCES IN KATANGA </p><p>PROVINCE.  HE ALSO SAID IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN FORCES TO BE ASSISTING IN ANY OFFENSIVE NEAR </p><p>LAKE TANGANYIKA BECAUSE 1) ZIMBABWE NO LONGER HAS AN </p><p>AIRLIFT CAPABILITY IN THE DRC, AND 2) ZIMBABWEAN FORCES </p><p>PULLED OUT OF KALEMIE ON LAKE TANGANYIKA LONG AGO. </p><p>MNANGAGWA REITERATED A POINT HE HAS MADE TO US BEFORE </p><p>THAT KABILA OFTEN GOES BEHIND HIS ALLIES\' BACKS ON NEW </p><p>MILITARY OPERATIONS AND THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THEIR </p><p>BIGGEST QUARRELS WITH HIM. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED THAT MONUC\'S MANDATE </p><p>EXPIRES DECEMBER 15 AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO STOP </p><p>FIGHTING SO THAT MONUC OBSERVERS CAN FULLY DEPLOY.  THE </p><p>USG IS TELLING RWANDA AND UGANDA THE SAME THING AND </p><p>URGING THEM NOT TO TRY TO RETAKE LOST TERRITORY SO THAT </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS STAYS ON TRACK.  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE </p><p>MEETING, MNANGAGWA TELEPHONED GENERAL VITALIS </p><p>ZVINAVASHE, COMMANDER OF THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06175  011533Z </p><p>(ZDF), TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE KATANGA CLASHES. </p><p>ZVINAVASHE CONFIRMED THAT AN "INCIDENT" HAD TAKEN PLACE </p><p>IN KATANGA, BUT THAT IT INVOLVED FAC AND INTERAHAMWE </p><p>FORCES, AND NOT ZIMBABWEAN FORCES.  NONETHELESS, THE ZDF </p><p>COMMANDER WAS GOING TO TALK TO HIS COMMANDERS IN THE DRC </p><p>AND PERSONALLY VISIT THE REGION ON NOVEMBER 3, ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE SPEAKER.  THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS </p><p>SOME LOCAL ZIMBABWEAN COMMANDERS WERE ACTING ON THEIR </p><p>OWN IN HELPING THE CONGOLESE, TO WHICH MNANGAGWA REPLIED </p><p>THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT WAS OCCURRING SINCE THE ZDF </p><p>IS A VERY DISCIPLINED FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  MNANGAGWA, EVER COY WITH US ON DRC </p><p>MATTERS, ALMOST CERTAINLY PRETENDED TO BE IGNORANT OF </p><p>THE FIGHTING IN KATANGA.  HE PERSONALLY HAS TOO MANY </p><p>FINANCIAL INTERESTS AT STAKE TO BE UNAWARE OF WHAT\'S </p><p>GOING ON, ESPECIALLY WITH HIS EASY ACCESS TO GENERAL </p><p>ZVINAVASHE.  NONETHELESS, MNANGAGWA, WHO REMAINS ONE OF </p><p>OUR FEW AUTHORITATIVE CONTACTS ON THE DRC IN THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT, APPEARED TO TAKE OUR CONCERNS ON </p><p>BOARD.  IF ZVINAVASHE INTENDS TO GO TO KATANGA THIS </p><p>WEEK, IT IS A SIGN THAT, AT A MINIMUM, ZIMBABWEAN FORCES </p><p>ARE THREATENED BY THE RECENT CLASHES.  WE WILL BE </p><p>CONTACTING MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>NICHOLAS GOCHE, WHEN HE RETURNS LATER THIS WEEK, TO GET </p><p>AN ADDITIONAL READ ON THE DRC FIGHTING.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFID </p><p></p></div>
