HE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT JMC </p><p>AND MONUC NEED TO COOPERATE, AND THAT, IN FACT, WHAT HE </p><p>CALLED "POINTLESS SQUABBLING" CAN WEAKEN THE JMC </p><p>SYSTEMS.

ON A POSITIVE NOTE, WHILE </p><p>MWEDZI IS NOT GOING TO REVEAL ANYTHING OF HIS OWN </p><p>THINKING TO US, HIS ASSESSMENT THAT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE </p><p>DAYS AFTER APRIL 14 WILL BE TELLING AND HIS ASSERTION THAT </p><p>THE GOZ IS EAGER TO PUSH THE PROCESS FORWARD PROBABLY </p><p>REFLECT THINKING HERE AT  THE HIGHEST LEVELS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
