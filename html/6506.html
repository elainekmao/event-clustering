<p>UNCLAS ADANA 0079 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, TU, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  NEWROZ CELEBRATIONS IN SE TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Newroz (Turkish spelling "Nevruz") </p><p>falls on Friday, March 21.  This spring festival </p><p>is the most important holiday for Kurds, and </p><p>since the 1990s has become increasingly linked to </p><p>Kurdish political aspirations.  Our contacts in </p><p>the region predict large public celebrations will </p><p>take place.  While our contacts in both the </p><p>Kurdish community and the GOT emphasize they want </p><p>the celebrations to remain peaceful and lawful, </p><p>the imminence of war in Iraq could spark trouble. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  DEHAP officials in Adana have applied </p><p>to the provincial governor and security director </p><p>for permission to hold Newroz celebrations.  As </p><p>of yesterday, no answer has been received.  DEHAP </p><p>says it is in control of its rank-and-file and </p><p>has warned against responding to "provocations". </p><p>They expect a crowd of up to 100,000 people in </p><p>Adana for a celebration to be held at a large </p><p>vacant lot off a main thoroughfare in Adana. </p><p>(Note:  Last year\'s Newroz celebration in Adana </p><p>drew approximately 50,000 people.  End note.) </p><p>The Security Directorate for Adana told us he did </p><p>not anticipate any violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Similarly, DEHAP in Diyarbakir is also </p><p>expecting a response from GOT provincial </p><p>officials to a request to hold Newroz festivities </p><p>there.   Timing is important, because, according </p><p>to the law, such permission has to be obtained 48 </p><p>hours in advance.  Last year, Newroz was </p><p>celebrated by more than 300,000 people at a </p><p>fairground some 15-km outside Diyarbakir on the </p><p>way to Elazig.  This year, DEHAP has requested to </p><p>use open land in the Huzurevleri neighborhood of </p><p>Diyarbakir municipality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)   Newroz could not be coming at a more </p><p>sensitive time, given the imminence of war.  Both </p><p>Kurdish and GOT interlocutors are pledging a non- </p><p>confrontational approach.  That said, the </p><p>potential is there for things to spin out of </p><p>control.  It should be recalled that the Newroz </p><p>holiday - celebrated by Kurds everywhere - is not </p><p>only a spring festival but also part of the </p><p>Kurdish people\'s foundation mythology, </p><p>celebrating a successful rebellion against an </p><p>ancient evil tyrant named Dahhak. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
