<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001135 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, INR AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/30/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PINS, EPET, ENRG, ASEC, CASC, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FUEL STRIKE SLOWS COUNTRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 1091 (B) ABUJA 1107 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The promised nation-wide strike by the </p><p>Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) over fuel price increases began </p><p>June 30. While the strike did not completely shut down the </p><p>country or any of its major cities, streets throughout </p><p>Nigeria were less busy than normal, as many workers stayed </p><p>home. A protest at the Federal Secretariat in Abuja was </p><p>broken up by tear gas and police reportedly arrested some of </p><p>the demonstrators.  Minor, scattered violence by strike </p><p>sympathizers has been reported, but we have no reports of </p><p>fatalities or significant property damage. Domestic flights </p><p>were canceled in the morning but some resumed in the </p><p>afternoon. Meanwhile, talks continue between the NLC and the </p><p>GON. NLC officials remain adamant that the strike will </p><p>continue until the fuel price increase is reduced.  Thus far, </p><p>the GON has characterized the price increase as </p><p>non-negotiable. This confrontation continues to present an </p><p>opportunity for Obasanjo\'s political opponents to press their </p><p>grievances by riding labor\'s coat-tails. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NLC Follows Through on Strike Threat </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Last-minute negotiations between the NLC and GON </p><p>failed over the weekend, and on June 30 the NLC went forward </p><p>with the nation-wide strike. The NLC refused to obey a </p><p>federal court injunction issued in Lagos enjoining the strike. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Crude Still Pumping </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas </p><p>Workers (NUPENG) officials reported June 30 that both </p><p>upstream and downstream workers are on strike. Chevron </p><p>officials say only 10 percent of Chevron\'s Lagos workforce </p><p>reported for work, but claim business as usual at its </p><p>Escravos facility. Mobil\'s head office is open and appears to </p><p>be normally staffed; however, some workers did not report at </p><p>its Apapa, Lagos, facility. An oil service representative in </p><p>Port Harcourt reported business as usual. There, union </p><p>leaders have told workers to support the strike yet ensure </p><p>that all essential work is performed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lagos Domestic Airport Closed; Streets Quiet </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In Lagos, streets were much quieter than usual for a </p><p>Monday. Although among the most vocal opponents to the fuel </p><p>price increases, transportation workers and owners continue </p><p>to ply the streets, but in far fewer numbers than usual. Gas </p><p>stations and banks in Lagos were reported closed or operating </p><p>with mostly management-level staff. Observers report that </p><p>many other businesses are closed either because workers could </p><p>not get to the office or stayed home for fear of violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The NLC had roadblocked many of the arteries to Lagos </p><p>domestic airport. Most domestic flights were canceled this </p><p>morning because jet-fuel deliveries were delayed, but some </p><p>flights resumed in the afternoon. International flights to </p><p>Lagos arrived this morning as scheduled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Scattered violence was reported on Lagos\' mainland, </p><p>including barricaded streets and burning tires. Columns of </p><p>police marching toward major demonstration points have been </p><p>reported in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Police Disperse Demonstrations in Abuja </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) In Abuja, NLC members and strike sympathizers </p><p>disrupted the morning commute by blocking major roads into </p><p>the capital with vehicles and burning tires. Over 1,000 </p><p>protesters rallied in front of the Federal Secretariat early </p><p>in the day.  By mid-morning, Police used tear gas to disperse </p><p>the crowd; some protesters were arrested.  Two journalists </p><p>were also arrested at the rally, but have reportedly been </p><p>released. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Other Cities Quiet </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) In Kano, over 2,000 students and workers protested the </p><p>fuel price increase by marching on Government House; however, </p><p>no violence was reported.  In Kaduna, Katsina and Zaria </p><p>public transport operators stayed home and observers describe </p><p>the cities as ghost towns. Observers reported some fighting </p><p>between strikers and police in Asaba, capital of Delta State </p><p>early in the day.  According to reports, Asaba is now calm </p><p>but traffic and business remains subdued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NLC Officials Call Strike A Success </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Senior NLC officials told Econoff that they were </p><p>satisfied with workers\' adherence to the strike on its first </p><p>day. NLC General Secretary John Odah said by bringing the </p><p>country to a standstill, President Obasanjo has no choice but </p><p>to negotiate with labor. Odah added that the NLC would likely </p><p>meet Obasanjo this afternoon; he was unsure whether the NLC </p><p>and GON could reach an agreement. Before the NLC would halt </p><p>the strike, he added, the GON must rescind the fuel price </p><p>increase and enter into a dialogue with labor over any </p><p>proposed fuel price increase. The GON would then have to </p><p>explain to labor why the four GON-operated oil refineries are </p><p>operating at less than 50 percent capacity or not at all, </p><p>Odah concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Post transmitted a message on the warden system </p><p>notifying U.S. citizens to exercise caution due to increased </p><p>tensions caused by the strike.  No incidents involving U.S. </p><p>citizens have been reported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) On it first day, the strike did not bring the country </p><p>to a halt. However, worker obeisance was substantial and </p><p>widespread.  The strike has caused disruption because of this </p><p>initial relative success, and therefore, has a chance of </p><p>gaining traction. Conversely, it also could fizzle in two or </p><p>three days.  Much will depend on the lessons the GON and NLC </p><p>learn this first day and on their perception of which of them </p><p>has the upperhand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) A meeting between the President and Oshiomhole was </p><p>scheduled later today. Oshiomhole - recently disparaged in a </p><p>major newspaper as a "former labor leader and the current </p><p>Special Advisor to the President on Strike Matters" - is in a </p><p>difficult situation.  He must balance his political affinity </p><p>to the Government with his obligation to the millions of </p><p>workers he represents. The strike presents a new opening for </p><p>Obasanjo\'s opponents to press their grievances over the April </p><p>elections. Barely one month into his new Administration </p><p>Obasanjo has taken a major step toward economic reform but </p><p>one that is politically unpopular. Should workers continue to </p><p>strike, Obasanjo might have to partially relax this </p><p>economically warranted move to get a political respite. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
