<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000140 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 01/24/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Next round of talks in Europe, as status of </p><p>LTTE senior negotiator\'s health sparks concerns </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Oslo-Colombo 01/23/03 e-mail </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-SA/INS 01/23/03 e-mail </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 120, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Lewis Amselem. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Norway has announced that the next </p><p>round of GSL-LTTE talks will take place in Europe, </p><p>February 7-8, not Thailand.  The exact venue has not yet </p><p>been formally set, but Berlin looks a strong bet.  The </p><p>switch was necessitated by the health condition of LTTE </p><p>negotiator Balasingham, who lives in London, and wants </p><p>the talks to be nearby.  The GoN also confirmed that the </p><p>February talks will focus on human rights and </p><p>humanitarian issues.  Given Balasingham\'s key role in </p><p>the peace process, the status of his health is sparking </p><p>increased concerns.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>Next Stop Europe </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Norwegian Embassy in Colombo sent out a </p><p>press release on January 23 officially announcing that </p><p>the fifth round of Sri Lankan government - Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) talks will take place in </p><p>Europe and not in Thailand as previously planned. </p><p>(Note:  This shift was foreshadowed in Ref C.)  The </p><p>dates of the talks will be February 7-8, a timeframe </p><p>truncated from the original February 7-10 dates. </p><p>(Note:  The Norwegian government\'s press release was </p><p>passed to SA/INS in Ref B.) </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>Berlin Seems Likely Venue </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The exact venue of the talks has not yet been </p><p>formally set.  According to contacts in the GSL and the </p><p>Norwegian Embassy, possible choices for the next </p><p>location include Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, and </p><p>Norway, where the third round of talks took place in </p><p>early December 2002.  Late January 24, Mission was told </p><p>by Norwegian Embassy poloff Tomas Stangeland that the </p><p>talks would probably be held in Berlin at the Norwegian </p><p>Embassy there.  The Berlin venue has not yet been </p><p>officially announced, Stangeland said, but it will </p><p>probably be set soon. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) As noted in Refs A and C, the UK is also a </p><p>possibility, as it is where LTTE senior negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham lives (his health condition precipitated the </p><p>change in venue -- see below).  Given the UK\'s legal </p><p>proscription of the LTTE, however, UK visas for Sri </p><p>Lanka-based LTTE delegation members might be difficult </p><p>to obtain.  (Note:  While not part of the official </p><p>rounds of talks, senior GSL Minister Milinda Moragoda </p><p>held a highly-publicized Norwegian-facilitated meeting </p><p>with Balasingham in London in July 2002.) </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>LTTE requests Change </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Although the GoN press release did not </p><p>specifically say it, contacts confirm that Balasingham\'s </p><p>health was the key factor in the change of venue and </p><p>dates.  (Note:  Balasingham has a serious kidney problem </p><p>that demands constant medical care, including dialysis.) </p><p>Stangeland of the Norwegian Embassy told us that </p><p>Balasingham himself requested the changes about ten days </p><p>ago.  Confirming information in Ref A, Stangeland said </p><p>Balasingham\'s health had not seriously deteriorated, but </p><p>that he was very tired from the long plane flights to- </p><p>and-from Asia.  By having truncated talks at a European </p><p>venue, he hoped to rest up for future trips, including </p><p>to the LTTE-controlled Wanni region to meet with Tiger </p><p>leaders ahead of the March round of talks in Japan. </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>Focus of February Talks </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The GoN press release also confirmed that the </p><p>February talks will focus on human rights and </p><p>humanitarian issues.  GSL and Norwegian contacts have </p><p>told us that the exact agenda regarding these topics had </p><p>not yet been developed.  Ian Martin, a former high- </p><p>ranking member of Amnesty International, will serve as </p><p>coordinator for the discussions on human rights issues, </p><p>which will focus on LTTE actions, including its forcible </p><p>recruitment of children (see Ref C).  We have also been </p><p>told by GSL contacts that the two sides may work to </p><p>ensure that the February talks steer away from </p><p>controversial topics such as the security zones in </p><p>Jaffna, so as to make the discussions less onerous on </p><p>Balasingham. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Norwegians seem to be trying their best to </p><p>assure one-and-all that Balasingham\'s long-standing </p><p>health problems are not worsening and that he is only </p><p>tired.  That may well be the case, but concerns are </p><p>increasing that Balasingham\'s tiredness is part-and- </p><p>parcel of a seriously deteriorating renal condition -- </p><p>and that he may be on his way toward being </p><p>incapacitated.  Given the secrecy of the Tigers, </p><p>Mission, unfortunately, has little way to confirm such a </p><p>dire prognosis.  That said, if Balasingham is somehow </p><p>sidelined, it raises real question marks about the </p><p>future of the peace process.  Balasingham is close to </p><p>LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran and also has extensive </p><p>international exposure, qualities that few others in the </p><p>LTTE have (no close matches come to mind, in fact). </p><p>Given the potential stakes, the GSL is clearly worried </p><p>about the issue.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
