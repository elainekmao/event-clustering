<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002891 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL, SIMS AND AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT: NYAROTA FIRED; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HARARE 2616 </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Geoffrey Nyarota (52), award-winning Editor-in-Chief </p><p>      of the "Daily News," has been fired by the newspaper\'s </p><p>      board of directors.  His deputy, Davison Maruziva, who had </p><p>      been asked to step in as acting editor by management, has </p><p>      also resigned in protest against Nyarota\'s dismissal. </p><p>      Circumstances leading to Nyarota\'s separation from </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s only independent daily newspaper are still </p><p>      murky, but seem to be linked to an ongoing labor dispute </p><p>      between journalists and management. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   In today\'s paper, Sam Nkomo, chairman of Associated </p><p>      Newspapers of Zimbabwe (parent company of the "Daily </p><p>      News"), states that Nyarota was terminated by the board </p><p>      with immediate effect, but fails to provide a reason for </p><p>      his dismissal.  According to the BBC, Nyarota denies having </p><p>      been fired and says he "resigned for the good of the </p><p>      paper."  Many sources say that Nyarota\'s dismissal has to </p><p>      do with an ongoing strike by the paper\'s staff, who are </p><p>      seeking a 150% cost of living salary increase.  The "Daily </p><p>      News" has been crippled by the industrial action, failing </p><p>      to produce a paper December 21 - 30, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   In March 1999 Nyarota, together with other local and </p><p>      foreign investors, launched the "Daily News," a newspaper </p><p>      that now has the highest circulation in Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>      paper has generally lived up to its motto of "telling it </p><p>      like it is."  Its principled, tenacious, independent style </p><p>      of journalism has earned praise at home and abroad. </p><p>      Nyarota himself has been the recipient of numerous </p><p>      international awards, including the World Association of </p><p>      Newspapers\' annual press freedom award in May 2002. </p><p>      Despite death threats, arrests and the bombing of his </p><p>      newspaper\'s printing press in January 2001, Nyarota </p><p>      continued to publish articles critical of the Mugabe </p><p>      administration.  Under his stewardship, the newspaper </p><p>      incurred the wrath of the government of Zimbabwe, which has </p><p>      accused it of being a mouthpiece for the opposition </p><p>      Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), a charge Nyarota </p><p>      strongly denies. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   The Daily News is back on the streets today, printing </p><p>      for the first time since December 21.  Today\'s paper is </p><p>      however far shorter than usual  (only 12 pages) and has </p><p>      very little advertising.  Today\'s edition breaks the story </p><p>      of Nyarota\'s dismissal and announces a new editorial team </p><p>      to be lead by John Gambanga, Acting Editor.  Nyasha </p><p>      Nyakunu, has been elevated to the position of News Editor </p><p>      with immediate effect.  Other appointments include Tendayi </p><p>      Nyakunu as Assistant Editor, Pedzisayi Ruhanya as Deputy </p><p>      News Editor, and Bill Saidi as Managing Editor.  Both </p><p>      Gambanga (April 1999) and Nyakunu (September 2002) are </p><p>      former participants in the Department\'s International </p><p>      Visitor program. </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Comment: The "Daily News" is the second of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      four independent newspapers to undergo an editorial shake- </p><p>      up in the past six weeks.  The highly respected weekly </p><p>      "Financial Gazette" lost veteran editor Francis Mdlongwa in </p><p>      late November after a change in ownership of the paper\'s </p><p>      parent company. (See reftel for additional details.) </p><p>      Readers will be watching both the "Daily" and the "Fingaz" </p><p>      for signals that the either paper\'s fiercely independent </p><p>      editorial stance has shifted under new leadership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
