SUMMARY. A HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER AT THE MAIN PARTY SCHOOL </p><p>HAS FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS BEEN UNDERTAKING A UNIQUE </p><p>EFFORT TO EDUCATE OFFICIALS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00156  01 OF 02  240242Z </p><p>CONCEPTS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS.  THIS LONG-TERM PROCESS </p><p>MERITS OUR ATTENTION AND POSSIBLY SUPPORT, DESPITE ONGOING </p><p>DIFFERENCES OF VALUES AND APPROACHES TO THIS DELICATE TOPIC. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE HO CHI MINH POLITICAL ACADEMY -- THE CENTRAL PARTY </p><p>SCHOOL OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) -- HAS SINCE </p><p>1994 INCLUDED A RESEARCH CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  ITS </p><p>DIRECTOR, DR. CAO DUC THAI, TOLD POL/C ON JANUARY 23 THAT </p><p>ITS MAJOR FUNCTIONS ARE TO: </p><p>--  CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THE HISTORY AND THEORY OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS, BASED PRIMARILY ON INTERNATIONAL LAW; </p><p>-- UNDERTAKE RESEARCH PROJECTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATIONS </p><p>"AROUND THE WORLD," INCLUDING IN THE U.S.; </p><p>--  TEACH STUDENTS AT THE ACADEMY -- THE ALREADY ELITE AND </p><p>THE UP-AND-COMING OF THE CVP, AT NATIONAL AS WELL AS </p><p>PROVINCIAL LEVELS -- ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES AND THEIR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS; </p><p>--  DISSEMINATE HUMAN RIGHTS DOCUMENTS TO TARGETED GROUPS </p><p>WITHIN VIETNAM; </p><p>-- ADVISE THE GVN AND CPV ON LEGISLATION WITH HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>IMPLICATIONS; AND, </p><p>--  STRENGTHEN COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS, NGOS, </p><p>AND UNIVERSITIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE CENTER CURRENTLY HAS AN IN-HOUSE STAFF OF 16, </p><p>INCLUDING FOUR WITH DOCTORATES AND SIX WITH MASTER\'S DEGREE, </p><p>MOSTLY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW.  (ONE RESEARCHER/LECTURER WHO </p><p>SAT IN ON THE MEETING HAD AN LL M -- MASTER\'S IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW -- FROM A UNIVERSITY IN </p><p>SWEDEN.)  ANOTHER TWO DOZEN OR SO RESEARCHERS ARE ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00156  01 OF 02  240242Z </p><p>TEMPORARY LOAN FROM OTHER GVN AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE </p><p>MINISTRIES OF JUSTICE, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, AND PUBLIC SECURITY, </p><p>AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, DR. THAI SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALL STUDENTS AT THE ACADEMY (USUALLY 2-3,000 IN ANY </p><p>GIVEN YEAR) IN PRINCIPLE TAKE ONE COURSE ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW, ACCORDING TO DR. THAI (WHO </p><p>TEACHES THE COURSE), BUT THE CENTER DOES NOT NOW OFFER A </p><p>BROADER CURRICULUM.  IT PUBLISHES A REGULAR BULLETIN WITH </p><p>ARTICLES BY ITS RESEARCHERS;  DR. THAI PROMISED HE WOULD ASK </p><p>FOR PERMISSION TO INCLUDE EMBASSY ON ITS DISTRIBUTION.  HE </p><p>EXPRESSED A HOPE EVENTUALLY TO TRANSFORM THE BULLETIN INTO A </p><p>MAINLINE JOURNAL, WHILE ADMITTING THE DIFFICULTY IN </p><p>SUSTAINING SUCH AN EFFORT ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS.  UNESCO </p><p>UNDERWRITES ANOTHER OF THE CENTER\'S PROGRAMS, PUBLISHING </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS DOCUMENTS AIMED AT CHILDREN, HE NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE CENTER HAD ADVISED THE GVN AND </p><p>CPV ON LEGISLATION, DR. THAI CITED EVOLVING NATIONAL POLICY </p><p>ON PEOPLE WITH AIDS.  HE NOTED THE REAL PROBLEM OF SOCIETAL </p><p>DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THIS POPULATION AND THE NEED FOR </p><p>LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THEIR LEGITIMATE AND EQUAL RIGHTS </p><p>BASED ON THE CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  DR. THAI CLAIMED THAT THE "SENIOR PARTY LEADERSHIP" WAS </p><p>VERY INTERESTED IN THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, HENCE THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS CENTER.  HE NOTED SPECIFICALLY THAT </p><p>MANY OTHER GVN OFFICIALS AND CPV CADRES DID NOT YET </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OR THE LEGAL BASIS -- IN BOTH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL TERMS -- FOR THESE RIGHTS.  THE </p><p>CHALLENGE FOR THE CENTER, HE SAID, WAS TO HELP IMPROVE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00156  01 OF 02  240242Z </p><p>LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS GENERALLY AND </p><p>SPECIFICALLY IN VIETNAM.  HE DESCRIBED THE CENTER AS THE </p><p>"UNIQUE AGENCY" IN VIETNAM TO UNDERTAKE THIS TASK.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT INTEREST AND UNDERSTANDING IN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>WITHIN VIETNAM WAS "INCREASING" AND ATTITUDES OF OFFICIALS </p><p>WERE GRADUALLY MORE "POSITIVE" AND "OPEN." HE ADMITTED, </p><p>HOWEVER, DIFFERING LEVELS OF INTEREST AMONG OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT FREQUENT COMPLAINTS FROM VIETNAMESE </p><p>ABOUT "INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS" WHEN OUTSIDE </p><p>OBSERVERS COMMENTED ON ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN </p><p>VIETNAM, DR. THAI CITED A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN RESEARCH </p><p>AND REPORTING ON HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ACTUAL INTERVENTION IN A </p><p>LOCAL SITUATION.  HE CLAIMED TO BE A FAITHFUL READER OF THE </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT\'S HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ON VIETNAM, AND </p><p>PROMISED TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK FROM THIS YEAR\'S REPORT.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE CENTER HAD NO/NO CONTACTS WITH INTERNATIONAL </p><p>GROUPS SUCH AS AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL OR HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH, </p><p>WHILE UNDERTAKING EXCHANGES WITH GROUPS IN AUSTRALIA, </p><p>SWEDEN, AND DENMARK. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WHILE ADMITTING THAT US AND VIETNAMESE PERCEPTIONS ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS WERE OFTEN AT ODDS, HE NONETHELESS CLAIMED THAT </p><p>OUR DIFFERENCES ON THIS ISSUE WERE NOT REALLY SO GREAT.  THE </p><p>PRIMARY DIFFERENCE RELATED TO LIMITATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL </p><p>FREEDOMS, WHICH WERE STILL IMPORTANT TO BOTH PEOPLES.  FOR </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4913 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00156  02 OF 02  240242Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------5C44C9  240242Z /38 </p><p>R 240226Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5297 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 000156 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>EXAMPLE, HE SAID THAT IN THE U.S., EVEN IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, PEOPLE COULD BUY AND WEAR T-SHIRTS WITH OSAMA </p><p>BIN LADEN\'S IMAGE ON IT, WHILE THIS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00156  02 OF 02  240242Z </p><p>VIETNAM.  (ACCORDING TO A JANUARY 22 REUTERS REPORT, POLICE </p><p>IN THE SOUTHERN COAST CITY OF NHA TRANG SEIZED A BATCH OF </p><p>SUCH T-SHIRTS, WITH ONE POLICE INSPECTOR QUOTED AS SAYING </p><p>"WE HAVE TO STEP IN TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THIS IMAGE OF </p><p>TERROR.")  DR. THAI NONETHELESS POINTED WITH PRIDE TO THE </p><p>MAJOR STRIDES IN PERSONAL LIBERTIES OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS </p><p>IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  POL/C ENCOURAGED DR. THAI TO INTENSIFY INTERACTION </p><p>BETWEEN THE EMBASSY AND THE CENTER AND NOTED AMBASSADOR </p><p>BURGHARDT\'S INTEREST IN VISITING THE CENTER AT A LATER DATE. </p><p>DR. THAI ACCEPTED WITH ALACRITY AND SAID THAT HE WOULD VALUE </p><p>SUCH ENHANCED CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT:  THE VIETNAMESE VIEWPOINT ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>REMAINS WIDELY DIVERGENT FROM OUR OWN, AND RESPECT FOR CORE </p><p>VALUES SADLY INADEQUATE IN BOTH POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p>IT IS NONETHELESS STRIKING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN THE </p><p>VERY BOWELS OF THE CPV WHO ARE STEADILY IMPLANTING THE </p><p>CONCEPT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS DO NOT STEM FROM AN ALIEN-IMPOSED </p><p>VALUE SYSTEM, AND THAT RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS DEEPLY </p><p>IMBEDDED IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND IN VIETNAM\'S OWN EXPLICIT </p><p>COMMITMENTS TO VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND ITS OWN </p><p>CONSTITUTION.  THAT THE CPV ITSELF IS FOSTERING THIS </p><p>INTERNAL REVOLUTION OF THINKING PERHAPS REVEALS AN INHERENT </p><p>RECOGNITION THAT BLUSTER AND DENIAL OVER HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ALLEGATIONS ARE NOT IN VIETNAM\'S LONG-TERM INTEREST, AND </p><p>THAT ONLY A CAREFUL LONG-TERM EDUCATION CAMPAIGN CAN </p><p>ADEQUATELY CHANGE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BOTH OFFICIALS AND </p><p>CITIZENS THROUGHOUT THE NATION.
