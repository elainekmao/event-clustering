<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001485 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, MOPS, MARR, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: CODEL WEXLER PRESSES RULING AK PARTY LEADER </p><p>ERDOGAN FOR ACCELERATED RE-VOTE ON U.S. TROOP DEPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: AK Party leader Erdogan initially told Codel </p><p>Wexler March 8 he may need several weeks (until end March) to </p><p>create the right conditions for parliamentary passage of a </p><p>resolution permitting deployment of U.S. troops through </p><p>Turkey.  When Codel and Ambassador pushed back that Turkey </p><p>must take the decision the week of March 10, Erdogan </p><p>countered that he will need "ten days" (until March 17 or </p><p>18).  Ambassador asked to meet with Erdogan quickly to clear </p><p>up directly all of Erdogan\'s misunderstandings.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In an extended meeting with ruling AK Party chairman </p><p>Erdogan evening March 8, Codel Wexler (Turkey Caucus </p><p>co-chairmen Wexler (D-FL) and Winfield (R-KY) and Caucus </p><p>member Rogers (R-MI)): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--underscored that they had come to Turkey to express their </p><p>concern at the potential damage to a six-decade friendship </p><p>and alliance from the Turkish parliament\'s March 2 vote </p><p>against U.S. troop deployment; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--pointed out that the American people would be mindful of </p><p>the reason for higher losses of U.S. troops if Turkey were </p><p>not a part of the coalition; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--emphasized that it would be inconceivable for the House of </p><p>Representatives to turn down the mooted economic assistance </p><p>package for Turkey if Turkey were in the coalition before an </p><p>operation began; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--noted that time is very short and pressed for a </p><p>parliamentary re-vote the week of March 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Acknowledging he is focused on his campaign for </p><p>election to parliament March 9 and subsequent assumption of </p><p>the prime ministership sometime in late March, Erdogan said </p><p>he does not want to risk a second, and fatal negative vote by </p><p>rushing the re-submission of the deployment resolution.  He </p><p>will need sufficient time to create the right atmosphere and </p><p>then to plan next steps.  Some members of the current AK </p><p>government cabinet voted against the resolution, a situation </p><p>he does not want to re-occur.  One cannot trust the current </p><p>government, which in any event will only be interim once P.M. </p><p>Gul resigns after the election, to pass the resolution. </p><p>Therefore it may be necessary to await formation of the new </p><p>government.  Timing depends not only on unavoidable </p><p>constitutional procedures but also on the willingness of </p><p>President Sezer quickly to give Erdogan the mandate to form a </p><p>new government.  The re-vote would thus come in about three </p><p>weeks, i.e., at the end of March. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Erdogan amplified his views with assertions that his </p><p>task is compounded by problems in U.S.-Turkish communications </p><p>and on political, military, and economic questions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) U.S.-Turkish communications: At the moment when he and </p><p>the GOT leadership were exposing themselves to great </p><p>political risk by pushing the resolution in the face of </p><p>opposition from political parties, NGOs, and the public, </p><p>"ugly anti-Erdogan, anti-AK, and anti-Turkish cartoons" </p><p>appeared in the U.S. press, Erdogan stated.  These cartoons </p><p>became convenient material for the opposition CHP to use to </p><p>humiliate AK M.P.s and change votes.  The USG has the power </p><p>and influence to inform the U.S. media in the way it wants to </p><p>(a remark which provoked disbelieving laughter from the </p><p>Codel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Political dimension: AK M.P.s were taken aback by the </p><p>news which swept the assembly chamber before the vote that no </p><p>Turkmen rep had been included in the six-man opposition </p><p>leadership council announced by the opposition conference in </p><p>Salahadeen, Erdogan said.  It is unacceptable for Turks to </p><p>see the Turkmen not given equal status with the Arabs and </p><p>Kurds as principal ethnic groups in Iraq.  In addition, AK </p><p>M.P.s were embittered by the news of the burning of a Turkish </p><p>flag by Kurdish demonstrators in N. Iraq.  They were angered </p><p>by provocative statements by KDP leader Barzani, who has </p><p>benefited from Turkish protection, and has traveled on a </p><p>Turkish diplomatic passport, for more than a decade.  Rumors </p><p>are now rampant that the U.S. is behind such anti-Turkish </p><p>displays by the Kurds.  The U.S. must above all prevent </p><p>Barzani from making such statements.  Then there was the </p><p>March 8 statement by UK P.M. Blair that the coalition will </p><p>block the occupation of N. Iraq by Turkish troops.  You want </p><p>Turkey in the coalition but then use a stick to threaten us. </p><p>We have a very weighty State tradition and we regret these </p><p>kinds of statements.  We are watching carefully.  We will </p><p>wait until the situation settles down to bring the resolution </p><p>to the floor again, he asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Military dimension: The citizens of Turkey had been </p><p>under the impression that the 42,000 U.S. logistics troops </p><p>would be based in N. Iraq.  When the news suddenly broke that </p><p>they would be based in S.E. Turkey, there was a negative </p><p>public reaction, and the opposition CHP and media immediately </p><p>allied against such a deployment.  The negative campaign was </p><p>compounded by U.S. demands to use airfields far from the </p><p>front.  The negotiations thus did not create confidence, </p><p>Erdogan averred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Economic dimension: The U.S. side pushed the most </p><p>important issues to a later date and refused to de-link the </p><p>aid package from IMF conditionality.  How could the U.S. </p><p>insist on maintaining such linkage on the eve of a war with </p><p>all the risks that entails, Erdogan asked.  Then the U.S. </p><p>objected to paying $100,000 (sic) in taxes.  The package\'s </p><p>credit line will depend on Congressional approval.  But </p><p>Congress won\'t approve the package -- if at all -- until two </p><p>months after the operation begins, an operation that will </p><p>last only a week.  Turkey will face immediate needs but will </p><p>have to await the by-no-means certain outcome of Congress\'s </p><p>deliberations.  What if Turkey takes advantage of the offer </p><p>of an $8.5 billion bridge loan but then Congress fails to </p><p>pass the package?  How will Turkey repay this loan? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Codel and Ambassador Pearson rejoined that: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The bridge loan will be available the day the operation </p><p>starts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Speaker of the House Hastert gave Fonmin Yakis and State </p><p>Minister for the Economy Babacan a commitment -- </p><p>unprecedented in the Ambassador\'s memory -- that if President </p><p>Bush wants the package, it will pass the House. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The USG has persuasive answers for all the questions </p><p>Erdogan raised, and it is clear the two sides need to sit </p><p>down so that the U.S. can clear up any misunderstandings on </p><p>the Turkish side.  Ambassador told Erdogan he would meet him </p><p>at any time the weekend of March 8-9 if necessary to clear up </p><p>all the remaining misunderstandings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) In a subsequent pull-aside between Erdogan and the </p><p>Ambassador and Codel, Ambassador said that, according to the </p><p>extended timetable Erdogan laid out, the coalition may be in </p><p>Baghdad before the Turkish parliament reconsiders the </p><p>deployment resolution.  Time is of the essence.  Turkey needs </p><p>to take the decision soonest.  Erdogan replied that he will </p><p>need "ten days" (until March 17 or 18). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
