<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003353 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DOJ FOR ICITAP -- Eric Beinhart </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PGOV, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA/POLICE REFORM:  FIRST QUARTER REPORT </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) SUMMARY:  Progress in implementing the INL/ICITAP </p><p>Police Reform project in Nigeria has been encouraging, </p><p>particularly given the past challenges in starting the </p><p>project.  A collaborative foundation among ICITAP advisors </p><p>and GON partners has been built and the forecast for </p><p>training and change management activities is good, provided </p><p>that commitments made to date by GON counterparts are </p><p>realized.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Building Relationships </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) The ICITAP Police Advisor/Project Manager arrived </p><p>at Post in mid-August, along with two Jos-based ICITAP </p><p>technical advisors (contractors) and immediately began </p><p>building working relationships with senior Police managers </p><p>at Police Headquarters in Abuja and the instructor training </p><p>center in Jos.  ICITAP staff has found a key partner in </p><p>Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Musa Abdulkadir, </p><p>who overseas all of the Police Training schools and </p><p>administration of the training curriculum. Abdulkadir </p><p>agrees with the USG project\'s goals of change in Police </p><p>training and has provided crucial, efficient support to the </p><p>ICITAP team.  Support at the Central Planning and Training </p><p>Unit (CPTU) in Jos -- charged with training of Police </p><p>Trainers and updating the various Police curricula -- has </p><p>been less even, though new instructors are eager to work </p><p>with ICITAP in implementing the new Basic Recruit </p><p>curriculum.  The Director of the CPTU has just been removed </p><p>and the Deputy Inspector General for Training guarantees </p><p>the ICITAP PA/PM that the new Director will be more </p><p>motivated to his task of training reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Inspector General of Police (IG) Tafa Balogun </p><p>supports the project in principle but has not been as </p><p>active as he could be.  From numerous candid accounts by </p><p>his staff, Balogun apparently remains suspicious of USG </p><p>intentions and reluctant to quickly and fully embrace </p><p>comprehensive reforms in Nigeria Police management. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) The immediate work goals of reviewing and </p><p>redesigning the basic recruit curriculum and instructor </p><p>development curriculum have been achieved.   ICITAP </p><p>technical advisors assigned to work the NP\'s CPTU staff in </p><p>Jos have designed curricula for both basic recruits and the </p><p>instructors who train those recruits.  Jos has proven a </p><p>good base from where current and future training efforts </p><p>can be centralized.   At the CPTU facility on the Jos </p><p>Police College campus, ICITAP has an office with computers, </p><p>training aides, and a photocopier -- all with generator </p><p>support.  Operating costs are lower than elsewhere in the </p><p>country and the College campus offers a ready learning </p><p>center where officers can reside while receiving training </p><p>or working with ICITAP on additional curricula reforms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Next Step:  Kaduna </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) The ICITAP Facility in Jos will serve to train </p><p>basic recruit instructors there and conduct elections </p><p>security training and the CDM training for the Jos unit </p><p>(both discussed below).  Completion of the basic recruit </p><p>curriculum, however, allows the project to move to the next </p><p>planned phase of direct training of a new batch of basic </p><p>recruits at the Kaduna Police College, to be carried out by </p><p>two ICITAP trainers overseeing newly trained NP instructors </p><p>at that College.  Currently, a batch of 500 new recruits </p><p>enters the College each month for a training course of six </p><p>months.  Few recruits fail their basic training, in order </p><p>to satisfy the Federal Government\'s order for a nationwide </p><p>recruitment drive of 40,000 new recruits each year. </p><p>Complementing this effort will be a Field Officer training </p><p>activity to prepare the front-line supervisors of the </p><p>recruits who will graduate and be posted to Kaduna.  A six- </p><p>to eight-month presence in Kaduna by two long-term advisors </p><p>is envisioned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) Kaduna Police officials, including the Commandant </p><p>of the Police College and the Commissioner of Police for </p><p>the State, have voiced their support for the project\'s </p><p>goals in Kaduna.  Kaduna State Governor Makarfi has </p><p>supported this effort since he was first briefed two years </p><p>ago; he reaffirmed this commitment in a meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador, RNLEO and ICITAP Project Manager on December </p><p>11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Civil Disorder Training . . in time for elections? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) Second year funding for the project includes </p><p>activities for elections security ($250,000) and Civil </p><p>Disorder Management (CDM) training.   Both have been moved </p><p>to the front of the queue for implementation before other </p><p>activities funded in the project\'s first fiscal year in </p><p>order to have impact, albeit very limited, on security </p><p>during the local and national elections scheduled for March </p><p>and April 2003.   Elections security training will take </p><p>place in early January 2003 for 80 NPF trainers -- two from </p><p>each of the countries 36 states and the Federal Capital </p><p>Territory and four from the CPTU.  This will be two weeks </p><p>of training on the precepts of controlling polling stations </p><p>to prevent disorder.  This is distinct from the more </p><p>operational training of the Civil Disorder Management </p><p>Units. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) Civil Disorder Management training to build </p><p>demonstration units in key urban areas with records of </p><p>civil unrest had been planned as part of the project </p><p>independent of the upcoming elections.  However, we hope to </p><p>commence training four units -- agreed to by the NP </p><p>managers -- in late January, contingent upon arrival in- </p><p>country of equipment to be provided to these units.  ICITAP </p><p>Trainers will visit Jos, Kaduna and Kano to offer four </p><p>weeks of intensive training of newly created CDM units of </p><p>50 policemen/women each.  A double-size unit of 100 will be </p><p>trained in Lagos for the CDM unit there.  The ICITAP </p><p>curriculum developed for this training is in line with ICRC </p><p>and UNHCR standards and will emphasize minimal use of force </p><p>-- without the lethal tools that most Police currently use </p><p>on crowd control situations.   If the schedule is </p><p>maintained, the four units will be ready for deployment in </p><p>late March -- in time for the national elections and </p><p>perhaps in time for the local elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(SBU) Key to the success of these units is that they will </p><p>operate largely independent of conventional police units </p><p>around them and will use amended Police Force Orders. </p><p>(Note: Current Force Orders authorize excessive use of </p><p>force to break up riots and crowds. End Note)  Once trained </p><p>on responsible techniques for handling unrest with </p><p>restraint and accountability, these units should not be </p><p>faced with contradicting orders from commanding officers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Change Management -- the Toughest Challenge </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(SBU)  The ICITAP Advisor has been able to build an </p><p>increasingly firm base of Police support for training </p><p>efforts and revisions to basic recruit training and </p><p>operations (e.g. Civil Disorder Management).  However, </p><p>acceptance of fundamental changes in the management and </p><p>oversight of the Police is hard to find.  The IGP seems </p><p>resistant to the planned activity of creating a Police </p><p>Modernization Committee composed of key stakeholders in </p><p>Police reform (the Police, NGOs, the media, community </p><p>groups, the National Assembly and the Police Service </p><p>Commission) to offer guidance and oversight to the process </p><p>of reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(SBU) We see the fledgling Police Service Commission, </p><p>inaugurated in late 2001 and mandated by the Constitution, </p><p>as key to prodding the Nigeria Police toward reform. </p><p>Assistance to help build the PSC\'s capacity will be </p><p>provided with FY02 ESF.   Key to the success of the change </p><p>management efforts of our project will be the forging of a </p><p>productive relationship between the Police hierarchy and </p><p>the PSC and among the two and other stakeholders in the </p><p>Police Reform process.  It is too early to gauge the </p><p>prospects for this success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sustainability -- the Key Issue </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(SBU) Cooperation and commitment from the Police have </p><p>been good to this point.  The INL/ICITAP project will soon </p><p>test the depth of that commitment as it advances to the </p><p>next stage of demanding change in the deployment and </p><p>behavior of personnel trained under the new curriculum </p><p>developed and implemented jointly by ICITAP and NPF </p><p>instructors.  An example of this test will be the desire </p><p>that most or all of the 500 new recruits to be trained (a </p><p>six month period) at the Kaduna College be deployed within </p><p>Kaduna City -- a break from traditional practice of </p><p>deploying new recruits throughout the country -- and </p><p>allowed to operate along the newly designed guidelines </p><p>developed through the Field Officer training activity.  If </p><p>these requirements are met, this Kaduna deployment has a </p><p>high chance of success and could in Phase Two of the </p><p>project be replicated in the other three Police Colleges of </p><p>the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(SBU) While the lack of funding and equipment are </p><p>serious deficiencies, some of the other problems </p><p>undermining the performance of the Nigeria Police are based </p><p>in the outdated curricula and regulations of the Force and </p><p>in the attitudes of senior managers.  Too many senior </p><p>Police officers and outside policy-makers believe the </p><p>solution lies within increased recruitment of police </p><p>personnel and the provision of additional equipment. </p><p>Acknowledging the priority of improving the quality of new </p><p>recruits and their training and reform of the procedures </p><p>governing those new recruits\' behavior (including the </p><p>acceptance of outside accountability) will be a long-term </p><p>process but a process essential for these efforts to take </p><p>and hold. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
