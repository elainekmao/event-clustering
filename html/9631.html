<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001888 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PINS, PREL, PHUM, KDEM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: CONSTITUTIONAL COURT UPHOLDS APPEAL IN RIOS MONTT </p><p>CASE; STREET PROTESTS BY RIOS MONTT SUPPORTERS EXPECTED </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1862 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Constitutional Court met on July 23 to hear the </p><p>FRG\'s appeal ("ocurso" in Spanish) to the appeal filed by two </p><p>political parties against the earlier Constitutional Court </p><p>decision which allowed former de facto President Efrain Rios </p><p>Montt to become a presidential candidate (reftels).  Again, </p><p>one permanent magistrate recused himself, and an alternate </p><p>(Gloria Melgar) replaced him.  When the President of the </p><p>Court called the vote, three magistrates (including the newly </p><p>added alternate) voted to uphold the Supreme Court\'s decision </p><p>to accept the appeal, i.e. ruling against Rios Montt.  The </p><p>President of the Constitutional Court and the other </p><p>magistrate who voted for Rios Montt are reported to have </p><p>stormed out of the session, refusing to sign the court\'s </p><p>decision.  The newest decision by the Constitutional Court </p><p>does not resolve the case against the General, but by </p><p>upholding the Supreme Court\'s right to hear the appeal it </p><p>threatens to prolong the legal debate and makes it clear that </p><p>the ruling FRG might not be able to control the </p><p>Constitutional Court\'s ultimate decision. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Rios Montt had earlier told the press that, in the </p><p>event his candidacy continued to suffer legal hurdles, he </p><p>could not control his supporters who would likely protest in </p><p>the streets.  Many opposition leaders saw this as a </p><p>not-too-thinly veiled threat of violence.  Following the </p><p>ruling of the Constitutional Court, opposition party leaders </p><p>have told us that they have heard radio reports calling for </p><p>protests on July 24 in the departmental capitals of Santa </p><p>Cruz del Quiche and Coban, as well as in the capital.  In </p><p>Santa Cruz del Quiche, pro-Rios Montt protesters were </p><p>reportedly summoned to protest in front of the Pollo Campero </p><p>(owned by opposition financier Dionisio Gutierrez). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: The Ambassador and A/DCM have placed calls </p><p>to leading FRG legislators (who are all huddled in a closed </p><p>door meeting) to urge them to restrain their followers and </p><p>ensure that there is no violence.  The calls had not been </p><p>returned as of the transmission of this cable, but we will </p><p>continue pressing for a response. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
