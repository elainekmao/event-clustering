<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 002600 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>S/CPR for Eubanks, WHA/CEN for Trivelli and Lang, CA/VO </p><p>for Barry </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, PREL, ASEC </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAS TRIES AN END RUN TO NAME CONSUL IN </p><p>MOBILE; POST RECOMMENDS DEPARTMENT SAY NO TO GOH NOMINEE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Post was notified on August 1, that the </p><p>GOH was attempting to name U.S. legal permanent resident, </p><p>Elena Maria Diaz Marinakys de Szydel, as Consul General </p><p>of Honduras in Mobile, Alabama.  In addition to the fact </p><p>that no Honduran Consulate currently exists in Mobile, </p><p>Post has derogatory information concerning Mrs. Szydel\'s </p><p>activities in Honduras during 2000 and 2001, when she was </p><p>the dependent spouse the Area Engineer for the U.S. Army </p><p>Corps of Engineers (USACE). We believe that her conduct </p><p>during the time her husband was assigned to this Embassy </p><p>should make her unacceptable as a Consul General and </p><p>member of the Diplomatic Corps. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The proposed appointment came to Post\'s attention </p><p>when a citizen and resident of Panama, Ana Isabel </p><p>Pascual, applied for a visa on August 1, to work as a </p><p>domestic employee for Elena Maria Diaz Marinakys in </p><p>Mobile Alabama.  The same day, the Consular Section </p><p>received a call from Honduran Vice President, Alberto </p><p>Diaz Lobo.  Mr. Diaz Lobo said his daughter, Elena Maria </p><p>Diaz Marinakys, had been appointed as the new Honduran </p><p>Consul General in Mobile, Alabama and wanted to take the </p><p>applicant to the U.S. as her domestic servant.  When </p><p>informed that the Department of State had not given its </p><p>permission for Honduras to open a Consulate in Mobile, </p><p>Mr. Diaz said that there had been a Consul in Mobile for </p><p>years and his daughter was simply replacing the old </p><p>Consul. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Mrs. Marinakys later called the Consul General to </p><p>ask for a special appointment for her maid because she </p><p>was traveling with three small children and needed </p><p>assistance.  She further said that the applicant had been </p><p>working for her in the U.S. for the last year.  An </p><p>examination of the applicant\'s passport indicated that </p><p>she had been granted a B-1 visa in Tegucigalpa, on June </p><p>11, 2001 annotated to read, " Personal or domestic </p><p>servant travel only with the family of Kevin and Elena </p><p>SZYDEL".  Her most recent trip to the U.S. had been from </p><p>Feb. 19, 2002, until July 4, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) It became apparent that Elena Szydel and Elena </p><p>Maria Diaz Marinakys were one and the same.  On August 6, </p><p>Ms. Marinakys again called the Consular Section to </p><p>inquire about the visa.  She admitted that she was a </p><p>Legal Permanent Resident of the U.S., living in Mobile, </p><p>she was married to U.S. citizen, and all three of their </p><p>children were American citizens.  She said the GOH was </p><p>going through the process of getting Mobile approved for </p><p>opening a Consulate and that she would then follow </p><p>through to get a diplomatic visa for the applicant. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) A group of USACE contractors, from Mobile, </p><p>Alabama, including the Szydel family, were expelled from </p><p>Honduras by the Ambassador in 2001.  As USACE contractors </p><p>and direct employees of the Eterna Corporation, they </p><p>committed gross financial irregularities, tax </p><p>improprieties, customs violations, fraud, </p><p>misrepresentation, malfeasance and misfeasance.  An </p><p>investigation of their activities was conducted by the </p><p>Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and the Inspector </p><p>General of the U.S. Army.  The entire group of Eterna </p><p>contractors, and the Szydel family in particular, were </p><p>found to be deeply involved in questionable activities </p><p>during their stay in Honduras.  Specifically, the Szydel </p><p>family defrauded the USG by engaging in a rental </p><p>reimbursement scheme.  They lived in a house owned by </p><p>Mrs. Szydel\'s mother.  They lived there rent-free. </p><p>However, they submitted vouchers and received </p><p>reimbursements for rental expenses.  They shared the </p><p>reimbursements with Mrs. Szydel\'s sister, who represented </p><p>herself as owner of the property.  They committed fraud </p><p>and abused their tax exempt status by importing a luxury </p><p>automobile, a 2000 Lexus, for their personal use, while </p><p>fraudulently describing it on shipping manifests as </p><p>construction equipment.  They then imported a second </p><p>vehicle for personal use by taking it to Panama, removing </p><p>Mrs. Szydel\'s name, retitling it in her husband\'s name </p><p>and bringing it back into the country exempt from </p><p>taxation.   They ordered handmade furniture from a </p><p>manufacturing firm owned by her father and charged it to </p><p>the USG as as part of their household expenses.  All of </p><p>these activities were discovered during the U.S. Army </p><p>investigations.  Mr. Szydel was reprimanded and punished </p><p>by the USACE.  Mrs. Szydel refused to cooperate with U.S. </p><p>investigators and was not prosecuted under Honduran law. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Based on the the specific activities of Mrs. </p><p>Szydel, and her active involvement in defrauding the U.S. </p><p>Government, we request the Protocol office to find Elena </p><p>Maria Diaz Marinakys de Szydel unacceptable to serve as a </p><p>Consul General of Honduras in Mobile.  We also request </p><p>that she be found unacceptable as a member of the </p><p>Diplomatic Corps in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
