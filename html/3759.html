HANOI 2272    B.  HANOI 1189 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RAYMOND BURGHARDT, </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN A DISCUSSION WITH AMBASSADOR AND POL/C ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 18, COLONEL TRAN NHUNG (PROTECT), DIRECTOR OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF QUAN DOI NHAN DAN (THE </p><p>"PEOPLE\'S ARMY" NEWSPAPER), CONFIRMED REF A SPECULATION </p><p>THAT MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE GENERAL TRA WOULD NOT </p><p>TRAVEL TO THE U.S. IN 2002.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>MILITARY LEADERSHIP HAD DECIDED THAT GENERAL TRA WAS </p><p>"TOO BUSY" TO GO THIS YEAR, ESPECIALLY GIVEN ONGOING </p><p>"PROBLEMS" IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  WHEN ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY DID NOT PLAY </p><p>THE PREDOMINANT SECURITY ROLE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, </p><p>COLONEL NHUNG INSISTED THAT MND RETAINED A "VERY </p><p>IMPORTANT ROLE" IN THAT TROUBLED REGION.  COLONEL NHUNG </p><p>ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT MINISTER TRA WOULD PROBABLY </p><p>NONETHELESS VISIT THE U.S. SOMETIME IN 2003.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT MINISTER TRA WAS ONLY EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN HIS </p><p>POSITION FOR TWO YEARS, DESPITE HIS RE-ELECTION AT THE </p><p>RECENT 11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY INAUGURAL MEETING.  TRA </p><p>AND PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI WOULD BOTH RETIRE IN </p><p>2004, HE PREDICTED. (NOTE: MANY OTHER INFORMED </p><p>OBSERVERS HAVE MADE THE SAME ASSESSMENT.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COLONEL NHUNG DESCRIBED ONE OF THE MAJOR </p><p>PROBLEMS IN US-VIETNAM RELATIONS AS "FEAR" OF THE U.S. </p><p>BY SENIOR MND OFFICIALS.  HE CLAIMED THAT "WHENEVER YOU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02277  191026Z </p><p>SEE A POSITIVE EDITORIAL ON THE U.S., THAT </p><p>REFLECTS MY VIEWS; WHENEVER IT IS NEGATIVE, THAT COMES </p><p>FROM THE MINISTRY\'S LEADERSHIP."  HE ADMITTED THAT THE </p><p>MND WOULD NEVER ALLOW PUBLICATION IN QDND OF AN OP ED </p><p>PIECE WRITTEN BY THE AMBASSADOR.  (NOTE:  QDND EDITOR- </p><p>IN-CHIEF TOLD AMBASSADOR MAY 9 THAT HIS NEWSPAPER WOULD </p><p>WELCOME PAS-PRODUCED MATERIALS, AS LONG AS THEY FIT </p><p>GENERAL EDITORIAL POLICY -- REF B.)  ONE MAJOR REASON </p><p>FOR ANTI-U.S. SENTIMENT WAS CONCERN ABOUT THE </p><p>DIMINISHING ROLE OF THE MND, HE SAID.  HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>MND LEADERS BELIEVED THAT CONTINUED ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT -- AND CORRESPONDINGLY HIGHER LEVELS OF </p><p>TRADE AND INVESTMENT WITH THE U.S. -- WOULD FURTHER </p><p>WEAKEN MND\'S INFLUENCE WITHIN THE GVN.  HE DISMISSED AS </p><p>IRRELEVANT COMPARISONS WITH THE PRC, WHERE DEFENSE </p><p>OFFICIALS HAD OVER THE PAST DECADE PARLAYED GREATER </p><p>LEVELS OF NATIONAL PROSPERITY INTO HIGHER BUDGETS FOR </p><p>NATIONAL DEFENSE AND ACQUISITION OF MORE SOPHISTICATED </p><p>WEAPONS SYSTEMS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  AN OFTEN FRANK INTERLOCUTOR OUTSIDE </p><p>THE EARSHOT OF HIS COLLEAGUES, COLONEL NHUNG </p><p>UNWITTINGLY ECHOED VICE FOREIGN MINISTER LE VAN BANG\'S </p><p>REMARKS TO AMBASSADOR (REF A) THAT BOTH SIDES NEED TO </p><p>MAKE SURE THEIR RESPECTIVE MILITARIES WERE ON BOARD AS </p><p>DIPLOMATS SOUGHT FURTHER TO IMPROVE BILATERAL TIES.  IT </p><p>IS NO SURPRISE THAT SUSPICION AND CONSERVATISM REMAIN </p><p>THE HALLMARKS OF MANY SENIOR MND OFFICIALS, DESPITE </p><p>WHAT HAS BECOME ROUTINELY GOOD COOPERATION WITH THE US </p><p>MILITARY ON THE SEARCH FOR MISSING-IN-ACTION, MEDICAL </p><p>RESEARCH, AND DEMINING.  INTERESTINGLY, COLONEL NHUNG </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02277  191026Z </p><p>DID NOT CITE WAR MEMORIES AS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN MND </p><p>NEGATIVISM VIS-.-VIS THE U.S., BUT THIS LIKELY REMAINS </p><p>AN ISSUE FOR THE ELDER GENERATION OF ACTIVE AND RETIRED </p><p>GENERALS.  BUILDING UP OUR MILITARY-TO-MILITARY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH VIETNAM TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS IS AND </p><p>MUST BE A KEY GOAL FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, BUT IT </p><p>WILL NOT BE AN EASY TASK.  NASCENT MILITARY COOPERATION </p><p>WITHIN THE ASEAN FRAMEWORK, AS WELL AS NEW US-ASEAN </p><p>COOPERATION IN MANY FORMS AGAINST TERRORISM, MAY PROVE </p><p>TO BE HELPFUL BUILDING BLOCKS IN ADDITION TO OUR </p><p>UNILATERAL EFFORTS. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
