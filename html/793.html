<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 004502 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 11/8/02 </p><p>TAGS: War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT:  (U) CRIMES IN KRAJINA -- REPORT ON ARRESTS, </p><p>          CHARGES </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT P. FINN, DCM, PER 1(5)(B). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  AFTER CONSIDERABLE PRODDING, THE GOC </p><p>HAS PROVIDED US A REPORT INDICATING THAT AS OF OCTOBER </p><p>31, A TOTAL OF 19 PERSONS ARE UNDER CRIMINAL </p><p>INVESTIGATION FOR MURDERS COMMITTED IN THE "KRAJINA." </p><p>1260 PERSONS ARE BEING PROCESSED IN 779 CASES OF </p><p>LOOTING, AND ELEVEN PERSONS ARE UNDER SUSPECION OF </p><p>ARSON (THOUGH THERE MAY BE MANY MORE).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 7, A CONTACT AT THE GOC MINISTRY OF </p><p>INTERIOR PROVIDED US (AFTER TWO WEEKS\' DELAY) A REPORT </p><p>OFFERING DETAILS BEHIND SOME OF THE NUMBERS ANNOUNCED </p><p>EARLIER FOR JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING CRIMES IN </p><p>FORMER SECTORS NORTH AND SOUTH.  AS THERE WAS </p><p>APPARENTLY SOME HESITANCY ON THE PART OF OUR CONTACT IN </p><p>DIVULGING THIS MATERIAL, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT </p><p>HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR USG </p><p>BACKGROUND USE ONLY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, 19 PERSONS HAVE SO FAR </p><p>BEEN TURNED OVER TO INVESTIGATIVE COURT FOR POSSIBLE </p><p>CHARGES OF MURDER.  (NOTE: THE ACTUAL TOTAL APPEARS TO </p><p>BE 26 BECAUSE SOME INDIVIDUALS WERE INVOLVED IN MORE </p><p>THAN ONE OF THE CRIMES.)  OTHER CASES ARE STILL UNDER </p><p>"INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION."  SPECIFICALLY, THE CASES </p><p>INVOLVE MURDERS IN: </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  04502  091836Z </p><p>KOLARNA (1 PERPETRATOR/L VICTIM) </p><p>BRIBIRSKE MOSTINE (1/1) </p><p>JOSANI (1/1) </p><p>CAKICI (1/1) </p><p>ZRMAJNJA (2/1) </p><p>GOSIC (4/7) </p><p>VARIVODE (4/9) </p><p>OCESTOVO (3/1) </p><p>OCESTOVO (1/1 - ATTEMPTED MURDER) </p><p>RUDELE/TISMA (1/1) </p><p>STRMICA/DRONJCI (1/2 - POSSIBLE MANSLAUGHTER) </p><p>STUPNO (1/1) </p><p>MOSCENICA (1/1 & 2 WOUNDED) </p><p>BOBOVAC (1/1) </p><p>PLACE NOT GIVEN (3/2 & 1 WOUNDED; 2 SUSPECTS STILL AT </p><p>      LARGE). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE MOI FURTHER STATES THAT AT LEAST 2787 CASES </p><p>OF "FIRES, MAINLY IN RESIDENCES AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>BUILDINGS," HAVE BEEN REPORTED, BUT THAT BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>TIME REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FIRES WERE </p><p>CAUSED BY ARSON OR WAR DAMAGE, ONLY 11 PERSONS HAVE SO </p><p>FAR BEEN CHARGED.  THE RECORD IS BETTER ON FELONY THEFT </p><p>(LOOTING), WHERE 1054 CASES ARE UNDER REVIEW, OF WHICH </p><p>779, INVOLVING 1260 SUSPECTED INDIVIDUALS, HAVE BEEN </p><p>TURNED OVER FOR CRIMINAL PROCESSING (I.E., </p><p>INVESTIGATION). </p><p>- </p><p>6. (C)  COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH THE MOI HAD EARLIER RELEASED </p><p>SOME FIGURES ON TOTAL ARRESTS, THIS IS THE FIRST DETAIL </p><p>TO EMERGE CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE CHARGES AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  04502  091836Z </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, WHICH REPORTED CASES OF MURDER WERE </p><p>INVOLVED.  THE MOI SAYS IT IS CONTINUING TO INVESTIAGTE </p><p>ALL LEADS.  IN ANY EVENT, THIS REPORT IS THE FIRST </p><p>CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT THE GOC IS PROCEEDING, IN AT </p><p>LEAST SOME CASES, TO TRY TO PROSECUTE SOME OF THE </p><p>DOCUMENTED MURDERS AND OTHER CRIMES COMMITTED IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF "OPERATION STORM" IN AUGUST. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
