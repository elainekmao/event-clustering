<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001766 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF DECLARED WINNER OF KADOMA MAYORAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Chief of Pol Section Matt Harrington. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (c) Summary:  ZANU-PF was declared the winner of the July </p><p>27-28 Kadoma mayoral election by a slim margin.   The </p><p>pre-election period was marred by incidents of sporadic </p><p>violence and the mass arrest of prominent Kadoma MDC members </p><p>two days before the vote.  On the voting days themselves </p><p>independent local observers noted that substantial numbers of </p><p>individuals from outside of Kadoma were bused into the area </p><p>and that many of them joined the lines of voters at polling </p><p>stations.  MDC officials suspect that these individuals were </p><p>allowed to vote even though their names did not appear on the </p><p>official voters roll, and the officials criticized the use of </p><p>supplementary rolls which were not made available for public </p><p>scrutiny.  There were sufficient incidents of irregularities </p><p>to cast doubt on whether this outcome genuinely reflected the </p><p>will of Kadoma\'s residents.  The MDC has publicly denounced </p><p>the results of the election. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF WINS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c) Zanu-PF won the Kadoma mayoral election by a slim </p><p>margin.  ZANU-PF candidate Fani Phiri polled 6,886 votes </p><p>compared to 6,214 votes for MDC candidate Editor Matamisa.MDC </p><p>Secretary-General, Welshman Ncube publicly declared the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>results fraudulent because of what he described as widescale </p><p>irregularities on both polling days.  This was the first time </p><p>the MDC has lost a mayoral election in the six races it has </p><p>fielded candidates, beginning in May 2001. </p><p> </p><p>PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) On July 29, poloff spoke separately with </p><p>representatives from the Zimbabwe Election Support Network </p><p>(ZESN) and Silas Matamisa, Chairman of the MDC,s Mashonaland </p><p>West chapter, about the Kadoma election. Matamisa noted that </p><p>there was sporadic violence in Kadoma in the run-up to the </p><p>election.  On June 25, suspected ZANU-PF supporters </p><p>firebombed the residence of initial MDC mayoral candidate </p><p>Daniel Mugomba.  On July 22, MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai </p><p>was forced to cancel his appearance at a rally for Editor </p><p>Matamisa in Kadoma when ZANU-PF supporters took over the </p><p>rally site and assaulted several MDC members. In the week </p><p>preceding the polling, police arrested Kadoma MP Austin </p><p>Mapandawana and ten other MDC members at an election rally </p><p>that turned violent when ZANU-PF youth attempted to forcibly </p><p>disperse the gathering.  Mapandawana and the other MDC </p><p>members remained in police custody until the Friday before </p><p>the election. Matamisa commented that the detentions and </p><p>incidents of pre-election violence were aimed at disrupting </p><p>the MDC,s ability to successfully mount an election </p><p>campaign, and discouraging potential MDC voters from </p><p>participating in the voting. </p><p> </p><p>TURN-OUT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c) Out of 38,739 registered voters, 13,161 cast ballots </p><p>in the election, which represents 33.9% of eligible </p><p>voters.This compares to the 45.3% of registered voters who </p><p>voted in the 2000 parliamentary election in Kadoma,which the </p><p>MDC won by 12,049 votes to 5,666. ZESN National Chairman, </p><p>Reginald Matchaba Hove, speculated that the relatively low </p><p>turn-out could be attributed to the episodes of pre-election </p><p>violence and intimidation.  The turn-out in Kadoma was </p><p>slightly higher, however, than voter participation in other </p><p>mayoral elections in the past two years.  In the 2001 </p><p>Bulawayo mayoral race, for example, only 20% of voters </p><p>participated, while in the mayoral elections in Masvingo and </p><p>Chegutu,between 27% and 28% of registered voters cast </p><p>ballots.The 38,739 voters on the roll in the municipality of </p><p>Kadoma is remarkably close to the 40,882 voters on the roll </p><p>for the much larger district of Kadoma Central in the 2002 </p><p>presidential election, raising suspicions about possible </p><p>inflation of the numbers. </p><p> </p><p>5. (c) While both Matamisa and the ZESN observers agreed that </p><p>the turn-out was heaviest on Saturday, the first day of </p><p>polling, there were voting irregularities on both polling </p><p>days that might well have inflated the number of registered </p><p>voters that took part in the election. ZESN observer Prisca </p><p>Mukwengi noted that on both days people from as far away as </p><p>Chinhoyi (165km) and Sanyati (80km) were bussed into the </p><p>area.  When ZESN observers questioned these individuals about </p><p>what they were doing in the area, they replied that they </p><p>&were going shopping8.  The observers  later saw many of </p><p>these individuals blending into the lines outside of the </p><p>polling stations.   Matamisa noted that on the polling days </p><p>some ZANU-PF supporters were seen with supplementary voters </p><p>roll,that had not been made available to his party or the </p><p>general public.  He surmised that non-Kadoma residents were </p><p>able to successfully cast ballots because their names </p><p>appeared on these &unofficial8 rolls. </p><p> </p><p>KADOMA RESIDENTS TURNED AWAY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c) There were reports of individuals being turned away </p><p>from polling stations during the elections.  The ZESN </p><p>observers confirmed that a relatively small number of </p><p>individuals were denied the opportunity to vote,but,at </p><p>present, they could not give exact figures.  Mukwengi and </p><p>Chiseya noted that most individuals were turned away because </p><p>they either could not produce proper identification or they </p><p>were not on the official voters roll. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c) ZANU-PF ran a vintage campaign in Kadoma.  While the </p><p>relative lack of violence on the polling days was </p><p>positive,there are many troubling aspects of the election. </p><p>The arrest of Mapandawana and other prominent opposition </p><p>members in advance of the election was </p><p> a clear attempt by the ruling party to hamper the MDC,s </p><p>ability to successfully mobilize the vote.  In addition, the </p><p>presence of significant numbers of non-residents at polling </p><p>stations, and the allegations of supplementary voter rolls, </p><p>along with the pre-election incidents of violence, raises </p><p>doubts that the election results genuinely reflected the will </p><p>of Kadoma\'s residents. These irregularities also belie </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s claims that the Kadoma victory marks a fundamental </p><p>shift in its fortunes in urban areas.  ZANU-PF may have been </p><p>declared the winner, but true to form, they muddied the </p><p>waters to the extent that the legitimacy of the outcome </p><p>remains in doubt. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
