REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>REFS: HARARE 5337 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) IN AN INTERIM RESPONSE TO THE LAWSUIT FILED </p><p>RECENTLY BY THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU), THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT ON SEPTEMBER 26 RULED THAT FARMERS MUST BE </p><p>NOTIFIED 90 DAYS PRIOR TO THEIR EVICTIONS FROM ACQUIRED </p><p>FARMS.  IN ADDITION, THE COURT ALSO SCHEDULED A FULL </p><p>HEARING OF THE SUIT FOR NOVEMBER 6, 7, AND 8.  THE COURT </p><p>RULING DOES NOT HALT THE GOZ\'S "FAST TRACK" PROGRAM, BUT </p><p>IT SHOULD SLOW DOWN THE RESETTLEMENT PROCESS SOMEWHAT, </p><p>CERTAINLY UNTIL THE SUPREME COURT HEARS THE CFU\'S </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE IN NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) RICHARD AMIOT OF THE CFU TOLD ECONOFF ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 27 THAT THIS INTERIM RULING IS IMPORTANT FOR </p><p>TWO REASONS.  IT LIFTS THE IMMINENT THREAT OF EVICTION </p><p>THAT SOME FARMERS WERE FACING AT THE END OF THIS MONTH, </p><p>AND IT INDICATES THAT THE COURT IS GOING TO REQUIRE THAT </p><p>THE GOZ\'S "FAST TRACK" PROGRAM BE CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN LAW. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: THIS INTERIM COURT RULING COULD BUY SOME </p><p>TIME FOR THE CFU AND THE GOZ TO TRY AND REACH AGREEMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05469  281014Z </p><p>ON A RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM THAT BOTH CAN SUPPORT. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE GOZ HAS SHOWN LITTLE WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>COMPROMISE IN THE PAST, THE FACT THAT THE ATTORNEY </p><p>GENERAL\'S OFFICE AT LEAST PAID LIP SERVICE TO THE </p><p>COURT\'S RULING IS AN ENCOURAGING SIGN. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
