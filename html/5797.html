<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000427 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MCAP, PTER, ETTC, GT, PARMS </p><p>SUBJECT: MANPADS THREAT CONSIDERED MINOR IN GUATEMALA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 38880 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Robert E. Copley for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The information below is keyed by paragraph number </p><p>to reftel questions. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 7. General Information: To our knowledge, the </p><p>Government of Guatemala (GOG) does not possess MANPADS. </p><p>However, black and gray arms markets exist in Guatemala and </p><p>exotic weapons systems are said to occasionally move </p><p>through them.  Given the involvement of a Guatemala-based </p><p>arms dealer in the recent diversion of Nicaraguan assault </p><p>rifles to Colombian rebels and rumors of surplus MANPADS in </p><p>the region due to internal conflicts, we cannot rule out </p><p>the possibility that a very small number of MANPADS may be </p><p>held or obtained by non-state groups in Guatemala. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 8. Government Cooperation: The GOG can be </p><p>expected to cooperate in the effort to control MANPADS, </p><p>especially if we can provide it with specific information </p><p>about the existence of such weapons.  Guatemala\'s export </p><p>control regulations would technically prohibit transfers </p><p>but enforcement mechanism are inadequate and further </p><p>limited by rampant corruption at all levels of the GOG. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 9. Feasible Arguments: The GOG will be receptive </p><p>to the need for responsible action against the MANPADS </p><p>threat and will appreciate the magnitude of liability if a </p><p>successful MANPADS attack were to be traced to its failure </p><p>to take action.  Guatemala does not have a state-sponsored </p><p>air carrier, but depends heavily on tourism for foreign </p><p>exchange earnings. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 10. Financial Incentives:  Not applicable since </p><p>Guatemala does not have an official MANPADS stockpile to be </p><p>destroyed. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 11. Other Incentives: The bilateral relationship </p><p>is currently more fluid than usual.  This is an election </p><p>year and Guatemala was recently decertified for lack of </p><p>cooperation against narcotics.  Some, but not all, parts of </p><p>the GOG are anxious to cooperate with the USG.  The GOG </p><p>faces large and growing internal dissent which will tend to </p><p>focus its attention on elections above all else. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 12.  Government Contacts and Engagement </p><p>Activities:  The Ministers of Defense, Interior, and </p><p>Foreign Relations are the appropriate officials to contact </p><p>regarding this initiative.  Guatemala has appointed an </p><p>Inter-Institutional Coordinator for Security, roughly </p><p>equivalent to a Terrorism Czar.  The May 2003 Special </p><p>Conference on Security in Mexico would be an excellent </p><p>venue for approaching Guatemalan officials on this issue. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
