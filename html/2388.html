Rasheed met with Embassy EconOff regarding steps the </p><p>Central Bank might take in response to Refs A, B and C </p><p>regarding the Patriot Act and additional terrorist lists. </p><p>Rasheed reported that the Central Bank would issue circulars </p><p>requesting all banks to examine whether they hold accounts by </p><p>terrorist entities identified Ref A and C.  The CBN would </p><p>issue a separate circular requesting all Nigerian banks to </p><p>immediately communicate with U.S. correspondent banks and </p><p>provide them with the information required by the Patriot </p><p>Act, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.

Rasheed </p><p>commented that the CBN had initiated investigations into </p><p>Africa International Bank and Habib Bank based on suggestions </p><p>that they may have ties to the Middle East.  However, no </p><p>terrorist-held accounts have been discovered as of January 15. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Rasheed, as former CBN Director of International </p><p>Operations, had worked with the U.S. Embassy and Treasury </p><p>Department extensively in the past, in particularly on 419 </p><p>issues.  He said that the CBN wants to take a leadership role </p><p>in West Africa and on the continent in fighting terrorism. </p><p>He has very strong personal feelings, having lunched on the </p><p>top floor of the World Trade Center on September 7. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
