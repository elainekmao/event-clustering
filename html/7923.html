(C) Summary:  Since Turkey\'s financial crisis in early </p><p>2001, OYAK, the Turkish military pension fund, has been one </p><p>of the country\'s most profitable companies (it was the most </p><p>profitable in 2001.)  Its critics accuse OYAK of having </p><p>unfair tax advantages, and see OYAK\'s prominence as the </p><p>military\'s influence on the economy.  This report examines </p><p>OYAK\'s businesses (focused on auto manufacturing and </p><p>banking), and finds its recent success owes more to its savvy </p><p>management team under CEO Coskun Ulusoy than to any special </p><p>GOT benefits.  OYAK made a killing in the financial markets </p><p>in 2001 because Ulusoy predicted the devaluation and switched </p><p>from lira to dollar investments.  He is currently making </p><p>money the old-fashioned Turkish way (investing in T-bills). </p><p>But OYAK is not just another private sector Turkish firm </p><p>invested in T-bills - its initial source of liquidity is its </p><p>10 percent levy on military officers\' salaries.  OYAK\'s </p><p>success is helping a privileged group -- Turkish military </p><p>officers -- enjoy even more benefits.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What is OYAK? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Founded in 1961 to deal with the grievances of </p><p>underpaid military officers following the 1960 military coup, </p><p>OYAK (a Turkish acronym for the "Armed Forces Pension Fund") </p><p>is a supplementary social security institution for more than </p><p>200,000 active duty officers (160,000) and retired pensioners </p><p>(40,000).   Its initial source of income is a compulsory 10 </p><p>percent levy on the net salary of all military officers </p><p>(additional premiums, paid on an optional basis, provide life </p><p>insurance and disability benefits).  Pensions are paid to all </p><p>discharged members who have fulfilled at least 10 years of </p><p>service with the military.  Retirees then have the option of </p><p>reinvesting a portion or the entire amount of their benefits </p><p>back into the fund.  In 2002, OYAK paid out to its members an </p><p>average return of 41 percent (30 percent inflation) while in </p><p>2001 the average return was 95 percent (69 percent </p><p>inflation), according to OYAK annual reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In addition to portfolio investments in Turkish stocks </p><p>and government securities, OYAK is an unusual pension fund </p><p>that directly manages most of the 27 companies it invests in. </p><p> Its companies span the sectors of financial services, </p><p>automotive, cement, food and chemicals, and various services. </p><p> Its subsidiaries\' total asset value in 2002 was TL 5.9 </p><p>quadrillion ($4 billion).  Its annual profits in 2001 were TL </p><p>594 trillion ($486 million), a year-on-year increase of 173 </p><p>percent; annual profits in 2002 were TL 495 trillion ($329 </p><p>million). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) For most of OYAK\'s history, its top breadwinner has </p><p>been its partnership with French automotive giant Renault. </p><p>In 2001, this joint venture produced 170,000 vehicles and </p><p>registered gross sales of $766 million, becoming Turkey\'s top </p><p>auto producer.  However, revenues have decreased heavily </p><p>since the country\'s economic downturn the past two years.  In </p><p>the past three years, OYAK-Renault has gone from exporting 40 </p><p>percent of its vehicles three years ago to exporting 90 </p><p>percent of its vehicles in the first four months of 2003. </p><p>Since 2001, most of OYAK\'s 27 companies have struggled (like </p><p>most Turkish companies), and new investment has largely been </p><p>halted. (Comment:  The high rates of return on government </p><p>T-bills act as a disincentive for holding groups like OYAK to </p><p>invest in companies. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) As the company\'s new diamond in the rough, OYAK Bank </p><p>is the sole OYAK subsidiary receiving substantial investment </p><p>this year (mainly to build a more advanced information </p><p>technology backbone between all branches).  In August 2001, </p><p>OYAK purchased Sumerbank from the Banking Regulation and </p><p>Supervision Board (BRSA); Sumerbank was itself the  product </p><p>of a merger of six smaller failed banks that had been taken </p><p>over by the BRSA. According to a Moody\'s report of November </p><p>2002, OYAK was fortunate not to have had much retail lending </p><p>prior to the 2001 financial crisis, and did not experience </p><p>spread deficiency rates as large as those of other banks when </p><p>the crisis hit.  OYAK Bank expanded its retail lending only </p><p>after the official acquisition of SumerBank in January 2002. </p><p>With just $20 million to get SumerBank running again, OYAK </p><p>over the past 16 months has gone from a mere 11 branches to </p><p>230, and has gone from a virtually unprofitable institution </p><p>to a bank that today is worth $400-600 million and is still </p><p>growing, according to Ergun Okur, OYAK executive vice </p><p>president.  It is currently the 8th largest bank in Turkey - </p><p>OYAK plans to make it the fifth largest in the next few </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taking Advantage of the 2001 Financial Crisis </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) While not nearly as big as Turkey\'s famed Koc and </p><p>Sabanci holding companies, OYAK was more profitable than </p><p>either of them in 2001, and was among the top five most </p><p>profitable Turkish firms in 2002.  This is due primarily to </p><p>OYAK\'s savvy investment policy under CEO Coskun Ulusoy (and </p><p>also partly to the liquidity advantage of the 10 percent levy </p><p>on officers\' salaries).  Hired in 2000, Ulusoy immediately </p><p>overhauled the management of OYAK\'s companies, canceling $120 </p><p>million in planned investments, opting instead to invest in </p><p>stocks and securities.  (Note: Ulusoy has a PhD in economics </p><p>from the University of Pittsburgh, and is a former banking </p><p>executive at Citibank, KocBank, and later Ziraat Bank.  He </p><p>has the reputation of a bottom-line, American-style business </p><p>manager.  He resigned as CEO of Ziraat Bank rather than give </p><p>concessional loans to political cronies.  He was a protg of </p><p>Turgut Ozal, and has close contacts with retired generals </p><p>disillusioned with the present government. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) According to Executive VP Okur, Ulusoy anticipated in </p><p>early February 2001 that devaluation was near and, thus, </p><p>wanted to maintain as much liquidity as possible.  In OYAK\'s </p><p>2001 annual report, Ulusoy says that it was within Turkey\'s </p><p>"extraordinary economic conditions" that OYAK weathered the </p><p>storm and posted a net profit of nearly $500 million.  What </p><p>the report does not say is that Ulusoy got out of many of the </p><p>firm\'s lira investments before the devaluation.  In February </p><p>2001, OYAK immediately sold large portions of its Turkish </p><p>lira for dollars, going from 5 percent dollar assets prior to </p><p>the crisis to 45 percent following it.  Okur dismisses </p><p>allegations made by some newspapers at the time that OYAK was </p><p>tipped off to the devaluation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) OYAK has been thriving ever since, investing in </p><p>government securities with interest rates that have </p><p>consistently been at least twice as high as real interest </p><p>rates over the past two years.  With the exception of OYAK </p><p>Bank, Ulusoy has continued to halt new investments in its </p><p>companies, choosing instead to allow the company\'s portfolio </p><p>managers to invest as much liquid capital as possible into </p><p>government securities.  Okur shuns accusations of OYAK having </p><p>special advantages or insider information, though he admits </p><p>that this bonanza cannot last forever.  "We\'re earning lots </p><p>of money on interest rates and we realize that someday the </p><p>government will say \'sorry, we can\'t pay this anymore.\' We </p><p>all know the end of the movie.  But when it ends, I don\'t </p><p>know," he stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Does Military Influence Give OYAK Added Perks? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) OYAK is governed by Law No. 205, enacted in March </p><p>1961, which dictates that a Board of Representatives, </p><p>comprised of 75 retired military officers, oversee a General </p><p>Assembly, comprised of 20 Army officers and 20 civil </p><p>servants, which, in turn, oversees the Board of Directors, </p><p>comprised of three active generals, two retired generals, two </p><p>civilians, and CEO Ulusoy.  The law requires three auditors </p><p>to oversee the Board\'s monthly meetings - one elected by </p><p>OYAK\'s General Assembly, one assigned by the Prime Ministry, </p><p>and one assigned by the Banks Union of Turkey.  Says Okur, </p><p>this independent audit board is designed to prevent military </p><p>brass from unduly influencing OYAK\'s bottom-line goal of </p><p>making profits. </p><p>10.  (U) OYAK\'s critics allege that it is a tool the military </p><p>uses to consolidate its power, accusing it of having tax </p><p>advantages vis-a-vis competitors and, more sinisterly, of </p><p>using its influence to militarize the economy.  For example, </p><p>former Le Monde journalist and former French Ambassador to </p><p>Turkey and Egypt Eric Rouleau has written in Foreign Affairs </p><p>magazine that OYAK is exempt from all taxes and duties. </p><p>While it is true that military officers enjoy greater </p><p>privileges than civil servants at the same level (higher pay, </p><p>subsidized military stores, ability to obtain lower-interest </p><p>housing loans), this criticism of OYAK is simply not true. </p><p>All of OYAK\'s economic enterprises pay corporate taxes, and </p><p>any tax advantages it does have are similar to those of other </p><p>pension funds.  Our contacts at the GOT Ministry of Finance </p><p>and the EU mission in Ankara say they have never found OYAK </p><p>to enjoy special advantages because of its military links. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Critics such as Rouleau also allege that OYAK is </p><p>closely linked to its "sister firm," the TSKGV (Foundation </p><p>for the Strengthening of the Turkish Armed Forces), which </p><p>raises money through donations and invests in companies </p><p>exclusively devoted to arms production.  Because TSKGV </p><p>receives much of its income through charitable contributions, </p><p>the TSKGV enjoys a number of tax benefits.  These benefits, </p><p>however, do not extend to OYAK.  Okur claims that, though it </p><p>is not stated in Law No. 205, OYAK\'s company policy has </p><p>always been to avoid all arms contracts, citing </p><p>anti-competition factors as the reason.  He said that there </p><p>have been instances in the past when the TSKGV has taken </p><p>majority ownership of companies in which OYAK had a small </p><p>share.  Wanting to avoid the perception that it is involved </p><p>in war profiteering, OYAK would immediately sell off its </p><p>shares.  This was the case, said Okur, when the TSKGV bought </p><p>Aselsan Electronic Industries. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
