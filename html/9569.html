<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004583 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH NGO ASAM ARGUES FOR GREATER ROLE FOR </p><p>TURKMEN IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4544 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4550 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass. Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a July 16 meeting, Umit Ozdag, Director of the </p><p>Center for Eurasian Strategic Studies (ASAM -- a leading </p><p>Establishment think-tank), offered poloff his take on the </p><p>July 4 incident in Iraq and the way forward in U.S.-Turkey </p><p>relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ozdag called the July 4 incident, in which U.S. troops </p><p>detained Turkish Special Forces in N. Iraq, "unacceptable," </p><p>echoing a line from the military, President Sezer, and </p><p>opposition CHP.  Ozdag, who admitted he is considering </p><p>standing for election as chairman of the ultranationalist </p><p>MHP, asked, "How can something like this happen between </p><p>allies?"  In a conspiratorial tone, Ozdag argued that he </p><p>found it hard to believe that the decision to detain the </p><p>Turks could have been made by a local U.S. commander. </p><p>Instead, he averred, the operation "must have been </p><p>retaliation against the Turkish military directed by the </p><p>Pentagon." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ozdag conceded that the Turkish Special Forces may </p><p>have been pursuing "independent activities" in Iraq, which, </p><p>he said, is a clear indication that the Turkish General Staff </p><p>(TGS) does not fully trust the U.S. to protect Turkey\'s </p><p>interests in the region.  He claimed that USG policy toward </p><p>the Turkmen had raised alarm bells in TGS -- even more than </p><p>the PKK/KADEK issue.  As evidence, Ozdag pointed to the </p><p>absence of a senior Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) official on the </p><p>Iraqi Governing Council.  He also referred to the MOU text </p><p>negotiated before March 1, which mentioned "Assyrians and </p><p>Nestorians" as constituent groups in Iraq.  The inclusion of </p><p>these much smaller groups had left the impression among some </p><p>government and military officials that the USG intended to </p><p>shove the Turkmen aside, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In order to overcome the lack of trust, Ozdag argued </p><p>that "before anything else, the U.S. needs to apologize" for </p><p>July 4.  "The U.S. should make a gesture to the Turkmen," </p><p>Ozdag added without elaborating.  Explaining Turkish policy </p><p>on Iraqi Turkmen, Ozdag referred to an academic study of Iraq </p><p>published in the late 1950s, in which the population of </p><p>Kirkuk is described as "mostly Turkmen."  This, he claimed, </p><p>suggests that the population of Turkmen in Iraq could be as </p><p>high as 3 million, while "there are only 4 million or so </p><p>Kurds."  An accurate census in Iraq would confirm these </p><p>numbers and underscore the central role Turkmen should play </p><p>in administering the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The nominally "independent" ASAM in fact has long had </p><p>ties -- financial and other -- to the Turkish military and </p><p>bureaucracy, including widespread reports of direct funding </p><p>from TGS (ref A).  Consequently, over the years Embassy has </p><p>often sought ASAM\'s view as a reliable indicator of </p><p>Establishment thinking on a wide variety of issues.  In this </p><p>context several points are worth clarifying.  First, </p><p>throughout the meeting, Ozdag referred to himself as a </p><p>"Eurasianist" ("Avrasyaciyim") -- a code word often used to </p><p>indicate a perceived need to re-orient Turkish foreign policy </p><p>toward Central Asia and Russia, a position Ozdag shares with </p><p>some military hard-liners including NSC SecGen Gen. Kilinc </p><p>(ref B and previous).  Second, Ozdag is considering running </p><p>for leadership in MHP, a party known for its strong interest </p><p>in "Eurasia."  MHP is also assiduously trying acquire a more </p><p>sophisticated gloss (partly by seeking out people like </p><p>Ozdag), and is promoting the question of the Iraqi Turkmen as </p><p>a wedge issue between the U.S. and Turkey in a bid to </p><p>position itself as the TGS\' potential best political friend </p><p>and alternative to the ruling AK Party.  Finally, we note </p><p>Ozdag\'s insistence that the "independent activities" of </p><p>Turkish Special Forces occurred in a wider framework of </p><p>alleged TGS distrust of the USG, and thus that the July 4 </p><p>incident reflected an anti-Turkish plot from the highest </p><p>levels in the Pentagon.  We suspect this perspective owes a </p><p>great deal to the mirror-imaging often misapplied by Turks </p><p>when looking at the USG. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
