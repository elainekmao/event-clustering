<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003937 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EUR/PGI, OES/PCI </p><p>PLEASE PASS EPA/OIA (HHUYNH, WFREEMAN) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS NEEDS TO BE </p><p>STRENGTHENED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF. ANKARA 2712 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary. Even though Turkey\'s environmental laws are </p><p>written to produce environmentally sound economic </p><p>development, regulations fall short of providing the uniform </p><p>standards and technical criteria for preparing environmental </p><p>impact assessments (EIAs). The government\'s technical staff </p><p>is insufficiently trained to assess EIAs and developers seek </p><p>to circumvent the process.  As a result, many facilities in </p><p>Turkey are constructed without a professional environmental </p><p>review.  Turkey needs to strengthen its EIA infrastructure </p><p>to foster sustainable economic development. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Since 1993, the Ministry of Environment (now Ministry of </p><p>Environment and Forestry (MOEF)) has reviewed 815 EIAs. </p><p>Only 20 have been rejected. Turkey updated its 1993 EIA </p><p>regulations in 1997 and then again in 2002 but the new </p><p>regulations do not provide sufficient guidance for </p><p>professionals to produce effective EIAs, according to </p><p>several professional engineers who write EIAs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONCERNS WITH EIA REGULATIONS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The biggest flaw in the regulations, according to a </p><p>consulting engineer from ENCON, is that the regulations </p><p>include no guidelines, review criteria or technical </p><p>specifications for EIA preparation.  This makes EIA </p><p>approvals arbitrary and subject to corruption.  The </p><p>regulations diminish the EIA process, equating it with a </p><p>common permit-issuing system.  Most importantly, they do not </p><p>allow an EIA to focus on its intended goals -- identifying </p><p>and mitigating potential negative environmental impacts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Environmental engineers identified many other concerns </p><p>with existing regulations: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Double standards seem to apply, as only projects that </p><p>receive international funding require a second environmental </p><p>review (by the international funder). Locally funded </p><p>projects are reviewed only by the MOEF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The regulations are fraught with exemptions for favored </p><p>industries and projects.  Among the favored are floating and </p><p>mobile power plants and oil and mineral exploration.  In </p><p>protest, the Chamber of Environmental Engineers filed nearly </p><p>a dozen legal suits in the past two years targeting each </p><p>type of exemption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Time allotted for public discussion is limited to what </p><p>another consulting engineer referred to as "an impossible 30 </p><p>work days."  Public discussion on large public works </p><p>projects (pipelines, power plants) can require up to six </p><p>months for adequate public review and discussion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The regulations require the MOEF, headquartered in </p><p>Ankara, to audit EIAs.  To former consultant to Parliament\'s </p><p>Environment Commission Nuran Talu, the absence of on-site </p><p>auditing forces an unhealthy reliance on written reports and </p><p>detracts from the effectiveness of the EIA process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The regulations include no provision for the government </p><p>to fortify its central human resource pool. The level of </p><p>expertise varies dramatically among provincial experts who </p><p>are also required to review EIAs. The head of an </p><p>environmental consulting firm said he spends a good chunk of </p><p>his time teaching EIA reviewers and government officials </p><p>about what to look for in an EIA review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Since project owners must finance their EIAs, many seek </p><p>to circumvent what they consider a burdensome, non- </p><p>productive barrier that can delay a project by a year and </p><p>cost tens of thousands of dollars.  This obviates the </p><p>government\'s ability to review environmental impact and </p><p>implement planned development.  When combined with a large </p><p>number of projects legally exempt from EIA preparation, </p><p>projects completed without EIAs further frustrate progress </p><p>towards sustainable economic development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHAT\'S NEXT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Turkey is moving towards requiring an even more </p><p>demanding version of the EIA, the Strategic Environmental </p><p>Assessment (SEA).  Turkish engineers expressed concern that </p><p>their lawmakers do not fully comprehend the burden of the </p><p>stringent requirements, the breadth of the SEA, or the </p><p>expertise required to administer the program effectively. </p><p>SEAs require a very geographically broad review of an </p><p>expanded array of potential impacts.  If Turkey cannot </p><p>adequately manage its existing EIA responsibilities, </p><p>effective implementation of SEA requirements is doubtful, </p><p>one engineer commented.  However, Turkey was not among the </p><p>35 countries that signed the SEA protocol at the Kiev </p><p>Environment for Europe Ministerial last month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S CONNECTION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Three of Turkey\'s hottest EIAs under current </p><p>consideration involve or could involve U.S. companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Yusufeli Dam.  The Yusufeli Dam is one of 10 projects on </p><p>the Coruh River on the eastern Black Sea coast.  The </p><p>efficient operation of all projects is dependent on </p><p>Yusufeli\'s future energy generation. France, Spain, Belgium </p><p>and Britain had considered funding the project, then </p><p>declined.  U.S. companies may be approached to provide </p><p>funding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Hydropower Plants.  Alparslan-II and Durak are two BOT </p><p>hydropower plants that were awarded to consortia that </p><p>include Harza Engineering, a U.S. company.  No EIA has yet </p><p>been prepared for either project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- BTC.  Although the EIA process for the BTC pipeline was </p><p>completed and construction began in April 2003, </p><p>consultations continue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT.  Turkey\'s most vexing environmental issues </p><p>arise from uncontrolled development and urbanization. </p><p>Heeding the advice of environmental engineers and other </p><p>concerned professionals -- to strengthen the EIA </p><p>infrastructure further -- could fortify Turkey\'s ability to </p><p>achieve sustainable economic development </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
