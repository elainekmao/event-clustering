(U) Following is Post\'s submission for the third annual </p><p>Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report.  Embassy point of </p><p>contact for the report is Political/Economic Officer Sarah </p><p>Welborne (tel: 977-1-411-179, fax: 977-1-410-723, e-mail: </p><p>welbornese@state.gov). </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) OVERVIEW </p><p> </p><p>-- A. Nepal is a country of origin for international </p><p>trafficking of women and children.  Some trafficking also </p><p>occurs within the country.  The majority of those trafficked </p><p>are poor, undereducated young women, though trafficking in </p><p>boys also has been reported.  Girls as young as nine years </p><p>old have been trafficked. </p><p> </p><p>The magnitude of the problem remains difficult to measure, </p><p>as reliable data are not available.  The most widely quoted </p><p>NGO statistics state that 5,000 to 7,000 girls are </p><p>trafficked to India for prostitution each year, but these </p><p>figures are extrapolated, based on a number of assumptions, </p><p>and do not take into account any victims who are trafficked </p><p>for purposes other than prostitution. The GON does not keep </p><p>official statistics on the number of victims trafficked. </p><p> </p><p>An ILO-IPEC Rapid Assessment Survey (2002) on Trafficking in </p><p>Girls with Special Emphasis on Prostitution estimated that </p><p>12,000 girls are trafficked every year.  The study targeted </p><p>populations including "at-risk" girls, girls who had been </p><p>trafficked within Nepal, and those who had returned from </p><p>India.  Though trafficking is prevalent in many castes and </p><p>ethnic groups, the ILO assessment concluded that those most </p><p>at risk are members of lower castes and ethnic groups </p><p>traditionally resident in Nepal\'s hilly regions. </p><p> </p><p>Discrimination based on caste and ethnicity, though illegal </p><p>in Nepal, is imbedded in economic and social structures. </p><p>Gender-based discrimination is widespread, deeply rooted in </p><p>tradition and sometimes supported by law.  Women and girls </p><p>from lower castes or "hill" ethnic groups therefore can be </p><p>subject to double or triple marginalization, increasing </p><p>their vulnerability to exploitative practices such as </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>Additionally, an ongoing Maoist insurgency has disrupted </p><p>government control in some of the country\'s remote areas. </p><p>Economic insecurity, political instability and physical </p><p>danger as a result of the armed conflict have displaced </p><p>thousands of women and children from the poorest sectors of </p><p>society.  Threats of abduction by the Maoists have compelled </p><p>large numbers of children to leave their homes to avoid </p><p>forced conscription.  Death of one or both parents has </p><p>lowered an already poor standard of living for many </p><p>children, forcing them to work outside the home or fend for </p><p>themselves on the street.  NGOs report that trafficking is </p><p>on the rise in these vulnerable populations. </p><p> </p><p>-- B. The Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare </p><p>(MWCSW) has identified 26 high-priority districts for anti- </p><p>trafficking interventions, most of which are in Nepal\'s </p><p>hilly, undeveloped regions.  Most trafficking victims </p><p>originate in these high-priority districts.  Women and </p><p>children who have migrated to Kathmandu and other urban </p><p>areas to find work also reportedly have been trafficked. </p><p> </p><p>Nepali trafficking victims are most often taken overland to </p><p>India for work in that country\'s sex industry and for bonded </p><p>labor.  Some victims are also trafficked to Hong Kong, Saudi </p><p>Arabia and other countries in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p>-- C. No significant changes in the direction or extent of </p><p>trafficking have been reported in the last year. </p><p> </p><p>-- D.  Nepal\'s Institute for Integrated Development Studies </p><p>(IIDS) conducted a study entitled "Status and Dimension of </p><p>Trafficking Within Nepal" with UNIFEM support under the </p><p>South Asian Regional Initiative for Gender Equity </p><p>(SARI/Equity) program in 2002.  Supported by The Asia </p><p>Foundation, the Center for Legal Research and Resource </p><p>Development (CeLLRD) completed a baseline survey in five </p><p>districts. </p><p> </p><p>Also in 2002, ILO/IPEC published reports on Trafficking in </p><p>Girls with Special Reference to Prostitution, Trafficking </p><p>and Sexual Abuse Among Street Children in Kathmandu, Cross </p><p>Border Trafficking of Boys and Internal Trafficking Among </p><p>Children Engaged in Prostitution. </p><p> </p><p>-- E. Not applicable.  Nepal is not a destination country </p><p>for trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>-- F. Government officials, police and NGOs suspect that </p><p>organized criminal groups and "marriage brokers" are the </p><p>main traffickers in Nepal.  Though most are Nepali, they </p><p>have links with brothels in Mumbai and other cities in </p><p>India.  The traffickers typically target high-vulnerability </p><p>groups like those listed in para A.  NGOs have found that </p><p>once prevention programs are instituted in a district, </p><p>traffickers move on to other locations. </p><p> </p><p>In general, the main factors contributing to trafficking in </p><p>women and girls from Nepal are poverty, lack of alternative </p><p>employment opportunities in the countryside, illiteracy, </p><p>ignorance about the dangers of prostitution, family </p><p>disharmony, domestic violence and gender discrimination. </p><p>Contributing factors to the smaller phenomenon of </p><p>trafficking of boys for exploitative labor include poverty </p><p>and lack of alternative employment opportunities, as well as </p><p>a traditional pattern of male migration for employment. </p><p> </p><p>NGOs estimate that approximately half of victims are lured </p><p>to India with the promise of a good marriage and/or job, but </p><p>many others are sold by family members.  A small number are </p><p>kidnapped.  No firm numbers are available. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal and India have an open border.  Traffickers typically </p><p>move their victims overland on secondary roads or via public </p><p>transportation. </p><p> </p><p>-- G. Political will to combat trafficking exists at the </p><p>highest levels of government, and the GON is making a good- </p><p>faith effort to seriously address the problem.  The MWCSW </p><p>has instituted a National Task Force Against Trafficking to </p><p>coordinate government response, and is working with the ILO, </p><p>UNDP and other international organizations to increase GON </p><p>capacity to prevent trafficking and prosecute offenders. </p><p>Directly and through district-level task forces, the </p><p>Ministry coordinates with NGOs to rehabilitate and assist </p><p>victims.  There are programs in place to train police forces </p><p>and the judiciary to deal effectively with trafficking </p><p>cases. </p><p> </p><p>The MWCSW has drafted strengthened anti-trafficking </p><p>legislation to assist in the prosecution of offenders.  The </p><p>legislation has not yet passed. </p><p> </p><p>The current Assistant Minister for Women, Children and </p><p>Social Welfare, Ms. Anuradha Koirala, is an internationally </p><p>recognized anti-trafficking activist and head of a well- </p><p>known NGO in the field, Maiti Nepal.  One of the highest- </p><p>ranking police officers in the country, Dr. Govinda Prasad </p><p>Thapa, has been vocal in support and active in development </p><p>of national and regional anti-trafficking initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>-- H.  There is no documented evidence that government </p><p>authorities or individual members of government facilitate </p><p>trafficking, condone trafficking or are otherwise complicit </p><p>in such activities.  However, government authorities such as </p><p>immigration officials, police and judges do engage in graft </p><p>and corruption, and these practices no doubt play a role in </p><p>some trafficking cases.  There have been no reported </p><p>instances of prosecution or conviction of government </p><p>officials on trafficking-related charges. </p><p> </p><p>-- I.  One of the poorest countries in the world, Nepal </p><p>lacks the resources to address many of the underlying causes </p><p>of trafficking.  Under-funded government welfare agencies </p><p>are generally incapable of delivering effective outreach </p><p>programs or assistance to trafficking victims.  As a result, </p><p>anti-trafficking efforts have been primarily the domain of </p><p>NGOs and bilateral donors. </p><p> </p><p>Institutional capacity to address the trafficking problem is </p><p>weak.  In particular, the police lack both training and </p><p>resources, and the courts are overburdened and susceptible </p><p>to corruption. </p><p> </p><p>Political instability has also hampered GON anti-trafficking </p><p>efforts.  Several governments have come and gone in rapid </p><p>succession, and since the dissolution of the last parliament </p><p>in May 2002, no elections have been held.  As a result, </p><p>draft legislation to increase penalties for trafficking- </p><p>related offenses has yet to be passed, and the "National </p><p>Plan of Action" to combat trafficking has yet to be </p><p>implemented completely. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) PREVENTION </p><p> </p><p>-- A.  The Government of Nepal has acknowledged publicly </p><p>that trafficking is a problem.  Prime Ministers, political </p><p>party leaders, parliamentarians and ministry officials have </p><p>stated publicly that trafficking is a national problem. </p><p>Former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba affirmed during his </p><p>tenure that "the government has taken trafficking as a </p><p>serious problem," and "a serious crime."  Pledging to seek </p><p>stronger laws to prosecute traffickers, Deuba also said the </p><p>government must address the underlying causes. </p><p> </p><p>-- B.  The MWCSW has primary responsibility for the </p><p>development and coordination of the GON\'s anti-trafficking </p><p>efforts.  In addition, the MWCSW has instituted a National </p><p>Task Force Against Trafficking that includes personnel from </p><p>the National Planning Commission, the Nepal Police and the </p><p>Ministries of Labor and Transportation Management; Home; </p><p>Foreign Affairs; Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs; </p><p>Education and Sports; and Health.  The ILO, UNICEF and two </p><p>representative NGOs are also members. </p><p> </p><p>Additionally, the Nepal Police have established local-level </p><p>Women and Children Service Centers as part of their </p><p>community policing efforts.  The Centers operate with a </p><p>combined mandate of law enforcement, counseling and public </p><p>awareness. </p><p> </p><p>-- C.  The MWCSW, NGOs and UNIFEM have all implemented </p><p>local, regional and national information campaigns about </p><p>trafficking in persons.  The GON has prepared radio </p><p>programs, audio-visual presentations, booklets, pamphlets </p><p>and signboards aimed at preventing trafficking among </p><p>vulnerable groups.  "Village Vigilance Committees" (VVCs) </p><p>have been established as pilot projects in some districts, </p><p>training local residents to recognize possible trafficking </p><p>cases and rescue potential victims before they can be moved </p><p>across the border.  Though no statistics are available, the </p><p>GON reports that the VVCs have been successful in stopping a </p><p>number of attempts to traffic girls to India. </p><p>-- D.  Under a new GON initiative, announced in January </p><p>2003, all workers traveling overseas will be required to </p><p>attend an orientation session explaining worker rights, </p><p>safety issues and relevant regulations.  A labor office will </p><p>be established at the airport to reinforce the message.  The </p><p>12-point program also abolished a five-year-old rule </p><p>prohibiting Nepali women from working in Gulf countries. </p><p>The ban was imposed in 1998 after reports of hardship and </p><p>abuse from returning women workers.  Women\'s activists had </p><p>voiced concerns that while the law did not prevent Nepali </p><p>women from clandestinely departing from India for work in </p><p>the Gulf, it restricted women\'s access to information about </p><p>their destinations and prevented them from attending </p><p>orientation classes, putting them at risk of exploitation. </p><p> </p><p>The MWCSW publishes a newsletter addressing issues of </p><p>concern to women and children, and operates a program in 47 </p><p>districts to emphasize to parents the importance of sending </p><p>their children to school.  Encouraging children to stay in </p><p>school is also a large component of the government\'s </p><p>campaign to eliminate child labor, currently being carried </p><p>out under the auspices of a USDOL-funded Timebound Project. </p><p> </p><p>Government-initiated income-generation projects have been </p><p>introduced in more than 3900 villages, providing micro- </p><p>credit loans, administering savings programs and encouraging </p><p>banks to support women entrepreneurs in almost all districts </p><p>of the country. </p><p> </p><p>--E.  The GON is unable to support financially most </p><p>prevention programs, but is very receptive to private </p><p>efforts.  The government makes its personnel readily </p><p>available to take part in anti-trafficking training </p><p>programs, provides government facilities for outreach </p><p>programs and training, and otherwise supports private </p><p>initiatives to the best of its ability.  The Ministry, with </p><p>technical assistance from the Center for Population and </p><p>Development Activities (CEDPA) and funding from USAID/W, has </p><p>prepared a national Informal Education and Communication </p><p>(IEC) strategy.  The MWCSW provides additional funding in </p><p>priority districts. </p><p> </p><p>-- F.  The MWCSW fosters a collaborative relationship with </p><p>donors and NGOs in joint pursuit of anti-trafficking goals. </p><p>For example, "Beyond Trafficking -- A Joint Initiative in </p><p>the Millennium Against Trafficking of Girls and Women (JIT)" </p><p>is a collaborative effort of the MWCSW, UN System Task Force </p><p>Against Trafficking and other donors.  In addition to </p><p>cooperative work on the JIT and IEC, the Ministry has also </p><p>worked collaboratively with CEDPA and the ILO to establish a </p><p>Documentation and Information Center on trafficking and </p><p>developed software to manage information.  An Office of the </p><p>National Rapporteur has been set up with input from UNDP. </p><p> </p><p>-- G.  Nepal\'s open land border with India does not allow </p><p>for stringent monitoring.  One NGO has had some success at </p><p>monitoring the border independently, and UNICEF has provided </p><p>training for police and immigration officials to help them </p><p>identify potential trafficking victims at border crossings. </p><p> </p><p>-- H.  See para B for information about GON anti-trafficking </p><p>task force.  The Commission for the Investigation of the </p><p>Abuse of Authority investigates public corruption. </p><p>-- I.  At a South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation </p><p>(SAARC) Summit held in January, 2002, Nepal, together with </p><p>India and other South Asian countries, signed the SAARC </p><p>Convention on Preventing and Combating the Trafficking in </p><p>Women and Children for Prostitution.  Together with other </p><p>SAARC countries, Nepal has agreed to establish SAARCPOL, a </p><p>regional body to fight trafficking and other transnational </p><p>crimes.   Nepal and India have agreed to form a Joint Cross </p><p>Border Committee Against Trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal is a party to the Convention on Elimination of All </p><p>Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEADAW), the UN </p><p>Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ILO Minimum Age </p><p>Convention, the ILO Convention on the Prohibition and </p><p>Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of </p><p>Child Labor, the ILO Forced Labor Convention and the </p><p>Convention on the Abolition of Slavery. </p><p> </p><p>-- J.  The GON\'s National Plan of Action to combat </p><p>trafficking was developed in consultation with the ILO, NGOs </p><p>and relevant government agencies.  It has not yet been fully </p><p>implemented. </p><p> </p><p>-- K.  The MWCSW\'s National Task Force Against Trafficking </p><p>is responsible for developing anti-trafficking programs </p><p>within the GON. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS </p><p> </p><p>-- A.  No new anti-trafficking laws have been enacted, </p><p>though draft legislation exists and is expected to be </p><p>brought before a new session of Parliament, following as-yet </p><p>unannounced national elections. </p><p> </p><p>The Human Trafficking Control Act of 1986 is the current </p><p>anti-trafficking legislation.  It prohibits: </p><p> - Selling of a human being for any purpose; </p><p> - Taking any person to a foreign territory with an </p><p>intention of selling that person to a third party; </p><p> - Involving any woman in prostitution by enticement, </p><p>allurement, fraud, threat, coercion or any other means; </p><p> - Abetting, assisting, conspiring or attempting to carry </p><p>out any of the above acts. </p><p> </p><p>The 1986 Act is flawed in several ways.  It does not </p><p>criminalize the separation of a minor from his or her legal </p><p>guardian with the intent of trafficking the minor, nor does </p><p>it criminalize the receipt of a trafficked person.  Under </p><p>the terms of the Act, no crime occurs until the victim and </p><p>perpetrator are outside Nepali jurisdiction.  The Act makes </p><p>no provision for the compensation or protection of </p><p>trafficking victims.  Victims are often reluctant to </p><p>testify, because trials are held in open court and there is </p><p>no legal protection for witnesses.  Local police cannot </p><p>investigate trafficking complaints without permission from </p><p>prosecutors, and the resultant delay gives perpetrators time </p><p>to flee. </p><p> </p><p>-- B.  The 1986 Act provides for jail terms of up to 20 </p><p>years for traffickers, but penalties are often much less. </p><p>Approximately 38% of traffickers receive minimum sentences </p><p>when convicted. </p><p> </p><p>-- C.  Penalties for rape vary with the age of the victim. </p><p>If the victim is under 16, jail sentences of up to ten years </p><p>are possible.  For victims 16 and over, sentences can be up </p><p>to five years.  In either case, the court may order a </p><p>convicted rapist to give half of his property to the victim. </p><p>NGOs state that victims are not detained, jailed or </p><p>deported.  If the victim is a foreigner, he or she will be </p><p>handed over to the concerned Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>-- D.  During FY 2002, 92 cases of trafficking were reported </p><p>to the police.  2002 prosecution statistics are not yet </p><p>available. (Post will provide them septel prior to March </p><p>publication of TIP report.) </p><p> </p><p>-- E.  Government officials, police and NGOs suspect that </p><p>organized criminal groups and "marriage brokers" are the </p><p>primary perpetrators of trafficking in Nepal.  They note </p><p>that parents and other relatives of trafficking victims are </p><p>often complicit as well. </p><p> </p><p>-- F.  By its own admission, the government lacks the </p><p>trained manpower necessary to investigate effectively cases </p><p>of trafficking.  While no legal restrictions prevent the </p><p>police from conducting covert operations or electronic </p><p>surveillance, poor training, rudimentary equipment and </p><p>procedural inertia prevent the techniques from being </p><p>utilized. </p><p> </p><p>-- G.  As part of an anti-trafficking initiative begun in </p><p>1996, the Nepal Police have occasionally trained a limited </p><p>number of personnel in the investigation of trafficking. </p><p>However, most training programs of this type are developed </p><p>and administered by NGOs.  The GON supports programs to the </p><p>best of its ability by providing facilities and making its </p><p>personnel available to attend. </p><p> </p><p>-- H.  In October, 2000, Nepal\'s Home Ministry, the UN </p><p>Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and NGOs hosted a </p><p>regional workshop for senior police officers to enhance </p><p>cross-border anti-trafficking collaboration.  Several follow- </p><p>up meetings involving Nepal and India have taken place. </p><p> </p><p>-- I.  Nepal and India, are currently discussing their </p><p>bilateral extradition treaty, signed in 1955.  The treaty is </p><p>being updated to address transnational crimes more </p><p>effectively.  Nepali law does not prohibit the government </p><p>from extraditing its own nationals, but the GON has not had </p><p>occasion to do so in connection with trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>-- J.  Post has no evidence that, as a matter of policy, GON </p><p>authorities facilitate, condone or are otherwise complicit </p><p>in human trafficking.  However, local anti-trafficking NGOs </p><p>report that individual local officials and border police </p><p>sometimes accept bribes in exchange for allowing the </p><p>traffickers and their victims to cross Nepal\'s border with </p><p>India.  The Commission for the Investigation of the Abuse of </p><p>Authority (CIAA) has the power to investigate incidences of </p><p>corruption by public officials. </p><p> </p><p>-- K.  No GON officials have been prosecuted for involvement </p><p>in trafficking or trafficking-related corruption. </p><p> </p><p>-- L.  Nepal ratified ILO Convention 29 on Forced Labor on </p><p>January 3, 2002, and ratified ILO Convention 182 on </p><p>September 13, 2001.  Nepal has not yet ratified ILO </p><p>Convention 105. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal has not ratified the Sale of Children Protocol, which </p><p>supplements the Rights of the Child Convention; or the </p><p>Protocol to Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, </p><p>Especially Women and Children, which supplements the UN </p><p>Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS </p><p> </p><p>-- A.  Questions regarding residency status and relief from </p><p>deportation do not appear to apply to Nepal, as Nepal is not </p><p>a destination country for international trafficking in </p><p>persons.  For victims of internal trafficking, victim care </p><p>facilities are limited, and are run primarily by NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>-- B.  The GON provides limited funding to local NGOs to </p><p>provide assistance to victims of trafficking with </p><p>rehabilitation, medical care and legal services.  The GON </p><p>does not fund foreign NGOs.  Bilateral and multilateral </p><p>donors, working with the GON through the MWCSW, do fund </p><p>local and foreign NGOs to provide victim assistance. </p><p> </p><p>-- C.  The government of Nepal does protect the rights of </p><p>victims.  Trafficking victims are not detained, jailed, or </p><p>deported, nor are they, as trafficking victims, prosecuted </p><p>for violations of other laws. </p><p> </p><p>-- D.  While the GON has not actively encouraged trafficking </p><p>victims to file civil suits or seek legal action against </p><p>traffickers, once the victim does file a civil suit or make </p><p>a criminal complaint, the GON will prosecute the case at no </p><p>cost to the victim.  The Nepal Police have initiated a </p><p>"Women\'s Cell," aimed at assisting victims of trafficking </p><p>and domestic violence. </p><p> </p><p>-- E.  There is no provision for the government to provide </p><p>protection to victims or witnesses. </p><p> </p><p>-- F.  As part of the new foreign employment initiative </p><p>announced in January 2003 (see Prevention, para D), the GON </p><p>intends to open an Embassy in Kuala Lumpur and to appoint </p><p>labor attaches to Malaysia and UAE, both of which have large </p><p>concentrations of Nepali workers.  The government has also </p><p>initiated a request for Saudi Arabia and Malaysia to open </p><p>consular sections in Kathmandu.  A welfare fund will be </p><p>established to assist workers injured on overseas jobs. </p><p> </p><p>Government representatives at Consulates in India, the </p><p>destination country for most of Nepal\'s trafficking victims, </p><p>do not receive special training in protection.  However, </p><p>they assist with the repatriation of victims to Nepal if </p><p>cases are brought to their attention. </p><p> </p><p>-- G.  In May 1999, the MWCSW opened the Women\'s Skill </p><p>Development Center, a rehabilitation and skills training </p><p>center for women returned from being trafficked and for </p><p>women at risk of being trafficked.  Most "safe houses" and </p><p>rehabilitation centers are run by NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>-- H.  There are more then 40 national-level NGOs working on </p><p>the issues of trafficking.  With the GON\'s endorsement, many </p><p>NGOs conduct public information and outreach campaigns in </p><p>rural areas.  They also provide prevention education, micro- </p><p>finance, rehabilitation, advocacy and legal assistance.  Two </p><p>representative NGOs are members of the MWCSW\'s National Task </p><p>Force, and the GON works closely with NGOs to provide </p><p>services to victims and assist in the implementation of the </p><p>National Plan of Action. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) OMB Reporting Requirements:  One FS-03 officer spent </p><p>14 hours drafting and clearing this year\'s TIP report.  One </p><p>FS-01 officer spent one hour, one FS-02 officer spent 15 </p><p>minutes, and DCM spent 30 minutes clearing the report.  One </p><p>FSN-11 USAID employee spent five hours researching </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
