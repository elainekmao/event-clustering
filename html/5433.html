The National Security Council on Friday </p><p>afternoon will discuss the issue of Iraq, and alternative </p><p>war plans drafted by the TGS.  Papers regard today\'s NSC </p><p>meeting as `critical\' because the Council is expected to </p><p>evaluate U.S. demands from Turkey, and to  come up with a </p><p>response regarding Turkey\'s involvement in a possible </p><p>military action against Iraq.  The NSC will discuss the </p><p>possible deployment of U.S. troops  in Turkey, and regional </p><p>countries\' reaction to Turkey\'s likely presence in Northern </p><p>Iraq in the event of war.  The NSC will advise the </p><p>government to seek parliamentary approval for Turkey\'s </p><p>involvement in war.  The NSC will also decide on U.S. </p><p>requests for construction work to upgrade Turkish bases. </p><p>Papers report that the U.S. Ambassador to Ankara, Robert </p><p>Pearson, paid a visit to Prime Minister Gul on Thursday to </p><p>warn him that time is running short.  Pearson urged Turkey </p><p>to take a decision as soon as possible  regarding its </p><p>involvement in a possible operation.  Dailies carry a WP </p><p>article saying that in an effort to ease Ankara\'s concerns, </p><p>the U.S. will warn the Northern Iraqi Kurdish groups not to </p><p>enter Mosul and Kirkuk.  "Radikal" quotes a `high-level\' </p><p>Northern Iraqi official as saying that 2,000 U.S. troops and </p><p>intelligence personnel will enter the region from Turkey and </p><p>be stationed around Duhok, Erbil and Sulaimanija. </p><p>Meanwhile, dailies report Iraqi Ambassador Talib Salih\'s </p><p>warnings to the Turkish government not to open bases to the </p><p>U.S..  The Americans cannot succeed without Turkey\'s </p><p>support, Salih said, and if Turkey allows U.S. troops to </p><p>wage war against Iraq, the Iraqi nation will never forget </p><p>it.  Meanwhile, 35 Turkish citizens have volunteered to join </p><p>Mike Nichols O\'Keefe\'s group of human shields, who will be </p><p>traveling from London to Istanbul.  The groups will leave </p><p>for Baghdad on February 5 to stay there for two months.  We </p><p>are not going there to support Saddam, the volunteers said, </p><p>and if we feel we are being exploited by the Iraqi regime, </p><p>we will immediately leave Iraq. </p><p>Turkey, EU Troika meeting: Greek and Italian Foreign </p><p>Ministers Papandreou and Frattini, and EU representative </p><p>Solana came to Ankara on Thursday.  Papandreou said after a </p><p>meeting with Foreign Minister Yakis on Thursday that a </p><p>compromise between Ankara and Athens would serve as a model </p><p>for the sides in Cyprus.  Papandreou noted that political </p><p>will was essential for a solution to the Cyprus problem, </p><p>which he said is `very near.\'  However, Turksih Cypriot </p><p>leader Denktas sounded a pessimistic note, saying that even </p><p>is there is an agreement between the two sides on the </p><p>island, it will be difficult for the two communities to live </p><p>together.  Papers quote EU\'s expansion chief Verheugen as </p><p>stressing that even if no compromise is reached on the </p><p>island by February 28, the Greek Cypriot side will be </p><p>admitted to the EU as a full member in May 2003.  Verheugen </p><p>added that the EU prefers to see a united Cyprus as a full </p><p>member of the EU family. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This support is good enough for Bush" </p><p>Erdal Guven wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal (1/31): </p><p>"Following the declaration of support by eight members of </p><p>the EU for a US operation against Iraq, it seems that the </p><p>French-German bloc is isolated. . This is the kind of </p><p>support that will make President Bush very happy and will be </p><p>good enough to go ahead with his Iraq plan.  . As a result </p><p>of this support, we can conclude that the EU has not yet </p><p>developed a unified foreign policy; France and Germany are </p><p>the `engine\' but not the `brain\' for the Union.  We also can </p><p>infer that the EU enlargement process seems to be working </p><p>for the US benefit rather than the European Union\'s." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Waiting for February 5" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in conservative-mass appeal Turkiye </p><p>(1/31): "It remains to be seen whether Secretary Powell\'s </p><p>arguments and the proof that he will present will be </p><p>convincing enough for the members of the UN Security </p><p>Council, especially France, Germany, Syria, Russia, China </p><p>and Pakistan.  It does not appear that they will take the </p><p>evidence as the basis for granting full support to a US </p><p>military action against Iraq.  The UNSC members will most </p><p>likely work on the middle-way formula, asking Iraq to comply </p><p>and suggesting additional time for the inspectors. . </p><p>Nothing, however, will be able to change the US position. </p><p>The US will act the way it plans, and reactions from the </p><p>world will be doomed to remain irrelevant.  The US is on the </p><p>path of no return.  The operation will happen.  It is a </p><p>matter of the welfare of the American people and the </p><p>protection of the Pax-Americana." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
