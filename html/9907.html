<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001849 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (OHILTON); IIP/G/WHA DIPASQUALE; EB/EPPD DCLUNE; USTR </p><p>AGASH </p><p>INFO IIP/T/ES </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOs, IOs </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA, ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON CAFTA, AUGUST 4, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Article in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on </p><p>8/2 entitled "The crucial issues will be discussed in future </p><p>rounds". "The sixth round of CAFTA negotiations came to an end </p><p>with progress in some regulatory issues of the treaty, but the </p><p>negotiators couldn\'t reach an agreement on some key issues that </p><p>will be discussed in the next three rounds." </p><p> </p><p>"The negotiators have already concluded negotiations in two </p><p>chapters: electronic trade and customs procedures and trade </p><p>facilitation, but there was no consensus around the most </p><p>sensitive issues, such as agricultural products, textiles, </p><p>patents and trade sanctions related to labor and environmental </p><p>violations." </p><p> </p><p>"The US was clear that their positions will be flexible, but it </p><p>also wants reciprocity in access to Central American markets. On </p><p>this issue, the lead US negotiator Regina Vargo said, `we want </p><p>reciprocity and also some flexibility. although we don\'t </p><p>necessarily mean reciprocity in the sense of exchanging one thing </p><p>for another." </p><p> </p><p>2. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on </p><p>8/4 entitled "Progress of CAFTA". "The most positive result from </p><p>the sixth round of the CAFTA negotiations was that the isthmus </p><p>kept the unified position it should have had from the beginning, </p><p>after the Guatemalan reconsideration. The negotiations themselves </p><p>progressed on some regulatory principles, but the discussions on </p><p>key issues were left for the last three rounds." </p><p> </p><p>"Meanwhile, the Bush administration celebrated the Congressional </p><p>ratification of the FTA with Chile, the first the U.S. has signed </p><p>with a South American country, which improves the possibility of </p><p>achieving the goal of establishing a free trade agreement region </p><p>in the Americas by the year 2005." </p><p> </p><p>"We hope that in the seventh round of negotiations, the US goes </p><p>further than the `flexibility\' shown last week, to progress on </p><p>the most sensitive issues such as agricultural products, textiles </p><p>and patents. In the interim, the Central American negotiators </p><p>should work together and stay alert because it\'s up to them to </p><p>sign a good or bad agreement with the utmost and unique global </p><p>superpower." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
