<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 02486 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, LE </p><p>SUBJECT: FALLOUT FROM SIDON </p><p> </p><p>REF: BEIRUT 2456 </p><p> </p><p>1.  C-ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CONFUSION CONTINUES ABOUT EXACT SITUATION IN VILLAGES </p><p>EAST OF SIDON (REFTEL) WITH BEIRUT PARTIES PLAYING USUAL </p><p>ROLES IN GREEK CHORUS ON SIDELINES.  PALESTINIAN AND </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIM FORCES APPARENTLY CONTINUE TO OCCUPY </p><p>SEVEN CHRISTIAN TOWNS THEY SEIZED EAST OF SIDON.  REPORTS </p><p>FILTER IN ABOUT SOME 25,000 TO 75,000 CHRISTIAN REFUGEES </p><p>FROM REGION FLEEING TO EITHER JEZZIN OR BEIRUT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MEANWHILE, ESLEWHERE: </p><p>-  ASL COMMANDER LAHAD REPORTEDLY ISSUED STATEMENT 26 </p><p>APRIL THREATENING TO SHELL SIDON UNLESS PALESTINIANS AND </p><p>MUSLIM MILITIA CEASE OFFENSIVE.  HE ALSO IS QUOTED AS </p><p>WARNING LAF AGAINST SENDING TROOPS TO JEZZIN "BEFORE </p><p>BRINGING THE SECURITY SITUATION IN SIDON UNDER CONTROL AND </p><p>FORCING THE PALESTINIANS BACK INTO THEIR CAMPS." </p><p> </p><p>-  PRESIDENT GEMAYEL TELEPHONED SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD TO </p><p>BRIEF HIM ON DEVELOPMENTS IN SIDON; TWO LEADERS AGREED </p><p>TO KEEP IN TOUCH. </p><p> </p><p>-  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS MET 26 FRIDAY AND DEPLORED </p><p>SITUATION IN SIDON, CALLED ON FRIENDLY COUNTRIES </p><p>("PARTICULARLY SYRIA"), "ALL FREE NATIONS", AND POPE TO </p><p>HELP.  OTHER CHRISTIAN LEADERS, LED BY CAMILLE CHAMOUN, </p><p>ISSUED SIMILAR STATEMENTS </p><p> </p><p>-  GEMAYEL, PARLIAMENT SPEAKER HUSSEINI, AND PM KARAMI </p><p>MET 26 APRIL TO REVIEW SITUATION.  KARAMI AFTER MEETING </p><p>COMMENTED IN PART THAT RECENT ATTACKS IN SIDON WERE </p><p>"REACTIONS WHICH EXPOSED OUR BROTHERS...TO WHAT HAD </p><p>HAPPENED TO THEIR BROTHERS IN SIDON", COMMENT WHICH </p><p>SPARKED SHARP CHRISTIAN REACTION AGAINST WHAT THEY </p><p>VIEWED AS EXAMPLE OF KARAMI\'S LACK OF CONCERN FOR </p><p>CHRISTIANS WOES.  REMAINDER OF KARAMI\'S REMARKS AND THOSE </p><p>OF HUSSEINI AND OTHER MUSLIM LEADERS WERE DUTIFULLY </p><p>SOLEMN. </p><p> </p><p>-   SIDON DEPUTY NAZIH BIZRI ISSUED A STATEMENT </p><p>CONGRATULATING THE INHABITANTS OF SIDON FOR </p><p>THEIR, "VICTORY AGAINST THE LEBANESE FORCES AND </p><p>THE AGENTS OF ISRAEL."  ACCORDING TO BIZRI, </p><p>"WHAT HAS COME TO PASS IS THE WORK OF </p><p>SIDONIANS," NOT OF ARAFAT PALESTINIANS.  HE </p><p>CALLED THE EXODUS OF CHRISTIAN VILLAGERS AN </p><p>"ISRAELI PLOT," AND CALLED ON THE REFUGEES TO </p><p>RETURN TO THEIR HOMES. </p><p> </p><p>-  JA\'JA\'S CALL FOR A GENERAL STRIKE IN EAST </p><p>BEIRUT FOR APRIL 27 AS A PROTEST AGAINST SIDON </p><p>EVENTS, A CALL IN WHICH THE PHALANGE PARTY </p><p>JOINED 26 APRIL, HAS PROVED SUCCESSFUL, WITH </p><p>ONLY OCCASIONAL GAS STATIONS, BAKERIES, MOM AND </p><p>POP CORNER GROCERY STORES, PHARMACIES, AND </p><p>SIDEWALK NEWSTANDS OPERATING. </p><p> </p><p>-   CHRISTIAN STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS 26 APRIL </p><p>NUMBERING AN ESTIMATED 500 STUDENTS, MOSTLY FROM </p><p>THE SOUTH, MARCHED ON THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE TO </p><p>CRITICIZE THE FAILURE OF LAF TO DEPLOY TO </p><p>PROTECT THE VILLAGES AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE </p><p>LEBANESE FORCES.  DELEGATIONS OF DEMONSTRATORS </p><p>MET WITH LAF COMMANDER GENERAL A\'OUN.  THE ONLY </p><p>LAF REACTION THUS FAR HAS BEEN A CALL BY GENERAL </p><p>A\'OUN FOR LAF SOLDIERS IN THE SIDON REGION TO </p><p>REPORT TO THEIR UNITS. </p><p> </p><p>-  ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION BY SOUTHERNERS </p><p>RESIDING IN BEIRUT OCCURRED 26 APRIL ON THE </p><p>AUTOSTRADE NORTHEAST OF THE CAPITAL, WITH </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS BLOCKING ROADS, BURNING TIRES, AND </p><p>FIRING IN THE AIR.  OTHER DEMONSTRATIONS IN EAST </p><p>BEIRUT ARE REPORTEDLY SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 27. </p><p> </p><p>-   APPARENTLY AS THE RESULT OF AMAL LEADER </p><p>BARRI WORKING WITH CHRISTIAN LEADERS, AMAL HAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY DEPLOYED IN STRENGTH OUTSIDE THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN VILLAGE OF MAGHDUSHAH (POP. 8000) NEAR </p><p>MIYAH MIYAH TO PROVIDE PROTECTION TO THE VILLAGE </p><p>AGAINST ADVANCING PALESTINIAN/MUSLIM FORCES. </p><p>MAGHDUSHAH REMAINS CALM AND SECURE 27 APRIL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT.  ESTIMATES OF NUMBERS OF REFUGEES </p><p>APPEAR EXAGGERATED, AS DO LOCAL STORIES OF </p><p>"PALESTINIAN HORDES LOOTING AND BURNING." </p><p>NONETHELESS, THIS PERSPECTIVE REFLECTS DEEP </p><p>CHRISTIAN ANXIETY OVER THE SIDON EVENTS.  THE </p><p>MAIN TARGETS FOR CHRISTIAN REACTION ARE LAF, FOR </p><p>ITS FAILURE TO DEPLOY AS AGREED TO REPLACE </p><p>DEPARTING LF FORCES, AND MUSLIM LEADERS FOR </p><p>"FAILING TO KEEP THEIR WORD" TO PROTECT </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN THE SOUTH AS AGREED ALSO AS THE </p><p>PRICE OF LF PULLOUT.  BARRI\'S AMAL GETS GRUDGING </p><p>CREDIT FOR DEPLOYING OUTSIDE MAGHDUSHAH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  LAF DEPLOYMENT AWAITS "POLITICAL COVER" </p><p>WHICH A\'OUN TRIES TO INSIST ON BEFORE ACTING. </p><p>SATURDAY, APRIL 27, IS FULL OF MEETINGS, </p><p>CONSULTATIONS, TRAVELS, ETC., TRYING TO SET UP </p><p>BACKSTAGE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH WOULD PROVIDE SUCH </p><p>COVER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SOME CHRISTIANS INTERPRET THE ABSENCE OF </p><p>"POLITICAL COVER" FOR LAF DEPLOYMENT AS A </p><p>REFLECTION OF AN AGREEMENT TO COMPENSATE THE </p><p>SUNNIS IN SIDON FOR WHAT THEY LOST IN WEST </p><p>BEIRUT.  THE MAIN WINNER THUS FAR, HOWEVER, </p><p>APPEARS TO BE THE ARAFATI PLO, WHICH HAS </p><p>EXPANDED ITS CONTROL AND STRENGTHENED ITS </p><p>POSITION AROUND THE CAMPS, A RESULT WHICH </p><p>PRESUMABLY WILL NOT WARM ASSAD\'S HEART. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE PHALANGE\'S JOINING IN THE CALL FOR A </p><p>GENERAL STRIKE IN PROTEST AGAINST THE SIDON </p><p>EVENTS AND GOVERNMENT/LAF INACTION MAKES IT MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO PORTRAY BEIRUT DEMONSTRATIONS AS </p><p>LF-INTIFIDA ALONE DEFENDING CHRISTIAN INTERESTS, </p><p>BUT FASTER REACTION WOULD HAVE GAINED THEM MORE </p><p>CREDIT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
