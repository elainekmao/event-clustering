O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EMIN, ZI, ENGR </p><p>SUBJECT: Top Coal Exec Throws in Towel </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Dominant coal producer Wankie suffers </p><p>from an acute lack of foreign exchange that could </p><p>ultimately hamper Zimbabwe\'s energy output.  Top-of-the- </p><p>line Caterpillar haulers and Bucyrus-Erie Draglines sit </p><p>idle due to the costliness of imported parts.  Meanwhile, </p><p>the GOZ insists that Wankie sell coal at a loss to the </p><p>country\'s largest power station.  Outgoing Managing </p><p>Director Kudzai Bwerinofa told us the GOZ\'s unworkable </p><p>policies have prompted him to take early retirement. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>A 100-year old firm struggles </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Even outside the context of Zimbabwe\'s modest US$ </p><p>4 billion (and shrinking) economy, Wankie passes as a </p><p>serious enterprise.  The mining firm is the supplier of </p><p>coal to Hwange Power Station, which generates 60 percent </p><p>of Zimbabwe\'s energy, as well as smaller thermal stations </p><p>in Harare, Bulawayo and Munyati.  It trades on </p><p>Johannesburg, London and Harare equity exchanges.  After </p><p>independence, the GOZ believed so strongly in Wankie\'s </p><p>role that it acquired a 39 percent stake. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Given the GOZ\'s minority ownership, it is ironic </p><p>that public policy is running Wanke into the ground. </p><p>Managing Director Bwerinofa, a 20-year company veteran, </p><p>told us he cannot bear to administer a firm that has </p><p>become a hopeless case.  He is retiring 3-4 years ahead </p><p>of schedule.  The GOZ began to cap the price Wanke may </p><p>charge domestic customers for coal about a year ago -- at </p><p>a level below cost.  So the company has been losing money </p><p>domestically but managed to stay afloat through export </p><p>profits.  For Bwerinofa, the 2003 budget, which forces </p><p>Wanke to surrender up to 100 percent of export earnings </p><p>for exchange at the official rate (nearly 1/30 of the </p><p>market rate), was the final blow.  Wanke no longer has </p><p>foreign exchange to buy parts for expensive machinery. </p><p>Only 3 of 10 haulers, 4 of 12 dump trucks, 2 of 4 rope </p><p>shovels, 1 of 3 front-end loaders and 61 of 84 vehicles </p><p>were operational when we visited.  Admirably, opencast </p><p>operations are still running at 80 percent of capacity. </p><p>Without backup support, however, Bwerinofa says </p><p>production will continue to drop. </p><p> </p><p>Logistics hurdles </p><p>----------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) But Wanke\'s headaches do not stop there.  As one </p><p>of Zimbabwe\'s largest fuel consumers, Wanke has been hit </p><p>hard by the shortage.  Due to the National Railway of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s (NRZ) deterioration, however, Wanke must now </p><p>transport most coal by road.  NRZ is providing only one- </p><p>third the daily wagons that Wanke requires.  Road rather </p><p>than rail transport to Harare doubles the cost of coal. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (SBU) Like many companies in Zimbabwe, Wanke is now </p><p>operating within government-imposed constraints that </p><p>guarantee it will lose money.  The best management can </p><p>accomplish is slow the depletion of shareholder assets </p><p>and hope Wanke is still viable when policies change.  The </p><p>consequences of Wanke\'s potential demise are more </p><p>damaging than a run-of-the-mill business, since it </p><p>supplies the critical input for most of Zimbabwe\'s energy </p><p>(and stockpiles a mere 2-day reserve).  If there is a </p><p>shortage of coal, parastatal ZESA will have to import </p><p>electricity or limit services. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
