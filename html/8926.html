Nearly 400 WFP-contracted trucks from Syria with </p><p>approximately 16,000 metric tons (MT) of bulk wheat grain </p><p>have arrived at the Kirkuk silo complex since 12 June.  WFP </p><p>expects to be able soon to offload 6,000 MT per day at the </p><p>Kirkuk silo.  Food distributions are proceeding apace in </p><p>Kirkuk and Mosul.  Local purchase of the wheat harvest has </p><p>not yet begun in earnest because silos in the Kirkuk area </p><p>are apparently still not ready to receive wheat.  Food </p><p>distributions are continuing without major problems in As </p><p>Sulaymaniyah governorate, with May\'s wheat flour </p><p>distribution approximately 65 percent complete.  WFP wants </p><p>to incorporate vulnerability assessments into its monthly </p><p>monitoring activities in the three northern governorates. </p><p>As Sulaymaniyah farmers continue to harvest a bumper wheat </p><p>crop, but are pessimistic about other marketing </p><p>possibilities in Iran.  Populations in the former Ansar al- </p><p>Islam areas are pleased that radical elements have departed, </p><p>although residents are concerned about housing, employment, </p><p>and food distributions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Bulk Wheat Grain Arrives in Kirkuk </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   DART Team North food officer traveled to Kirkuk on 14 </p><p>June and found the World Food Program (WFP) receiving a </p><p>portion of 135,000 MT of bulk wheat grain.  The 135,000 MT </p><p>of wheat grain will be stored at the main Kirkuk silo </p><p>complex, which is being guarded by Coalition forces. </p><p>Approximately 20,000 MT has been offloaded and WFP- </p><p>contracted trucks from Syria are waiting outside the silo </p><p>for their turn to empty their load.  An estimated 390 </p><p>trucks, with approximately 16,000 MT of wheat grain have </p><p>arrived since 12 June.  The silo has been unable to receive </p><p>this quantity of wheat grain in a timely manner.  On 12 </p><p>June, WFP was able to offload 3,250 MT during the hours the </p><p>silo was operating. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Vacuvators to Increase the Speed of Grain Offloading </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3.   WFP recently airlifted four new vacuvators from Belgium </p><p>and one additional vacuvator is expected soon for the Kirkuk </p><p>silo.  The five vacuvators are expected to triple the </p><p>offload capacity of the silo, but so far have not performed </p><p>to this level.  The vacuvators\' performance is improving </p><p>daily as the technician who accompanied the four vacuvators </p><p>works to increase their off-take.  WFP has not paid for the </p><p>vacuvators, and payment is contingent on them operating as </p><p>per the performance specifications.  WFP expects that by </p><p>getting the vacuvators to work more efficiently, and by </p><p>leasing other equipment, it can increase offload capacity to </p><p>6,000 MT per day.  WFP has provided USD 5,000 for repairs to </p><p>the silo and for a new generator. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Public Distribution System Status for Kirkuk and Mosul </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   The Public Distribution System (PDS) is continuing </p><p>apace, with Kirkuk having completed distributions for </p><p>approximately 40 percent of wheat flour and other ration </p><p>commodities except rice, which is just starting to be </p><p>distributed.  Mosul has distributed approximately 50 percent </p><p>of wheat flour, 25 percent of other ration commodities, and </p><p>is also just beginning the rice distributions.  In a move to </p><p>begin shifting responsibility for the PDS back to the </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT), WFP in Kirkuk has signed over </p><p>responsibility of all ration commodities to the MOT, and is </p><p>now implementing only primary transport, offloading, and </p><p>monitoring.  WFP and the MOT sign the waybills for receipt </p><p>at the silo or warehouse, and MOT is then responsible for </p><p>coordinating food agents\' transport and distributions. </p><p>However, WFP remains ultimately accountable to its donors </p><p>for ensuring that the commodities are distributed properly. </p><p>Hence, WFP maintains its monitoring function. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Central versus Governorate MOT Responsibilities </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5.   WFP is getting along with the Kirkuk MOT but not so </p><p>well with the Mosul MOT, which is in direct contrast from </p><p>the situation several weeks ago.  WFP has still not been </p><p>able to sign over commodity responsibilities for wheat flour </p><p>and bulk wheat to the MOT in Mosul, due to the lack of clear </p><p>and timely instructions received from the Central MOT in </p><p>Baghdad.  The MOT\'s departmental capacities at the </p><p>governorate level vary widely as to how much responsibility </p><p>the governorates are prepared to take on without continually </p><p>expecting Baghdad to provide guidance.  The MOT in Mosul </p><p>seems to be especially dependent on Baghdad for guidance. </p><p>WFP does expect the official handover to be complete in </p><p>Mosul and Tikrit within the coming days, even though WFP </p><p>international staff is prevented from going to Tikrit due to </p><p>continued security restrictions.  DART Team North food </p><p>officer reports, however, that the WFP national staff in </p><p>Tikrit is doing a very efficient job. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Local Purchase Preparations </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   DART Team North food officer recently visited the </p><p>Riyadh silo, located approximately 40 kilometers southwest </p><p>of Kirkuk, near the town of Al Hawijah.  There is no actual </p><p>silo, but rather 30 open bins with a large holding capacity </p><p>of more than 100,000 MT.  Two bins are filled with last </p><p>year\'s wheat harvest.  Coalition forces are guarding the </p><p>silo compound.  Farmers have been asking silo staff when </p><p>they will be able to deliver their harvested wheat. </p><p>However, the weighing scales, laboratory testing equipment, </p><p>and office furniture were stolen and have not yet been </p><p>replaced.  The main constraint to starting the delivery of </p><p>wheat to the silo is the missing scales.  Staff at the silo </p><p>complex was unaware when this equipment will be replaced, </p><p>whether the USD 50,000 from the Office of the Coalition </p><p>Provisional Authority (OCPA) for the use by the MOT to make </p><p>preparations for the wheat harvest had been received or if </p><p>the MOT funds can provide for replacement of the scales, </p><p>laboratory equipment, and office furniture. (Note: DART Team </p><p>North reports that it is not aware of the USD 50,000 </p><p>payments being received by any MOT office in the northern </p><p>governorates.  End Note.)  When farmers may be able to </p><p>deliver their harvest to this reception site is still </p><p>uncertain.  DART Team North Food Officer expects to assess </p><p>whether other silo complexes in At Tamim governorate may be </p><p>better prepared to receive the local wheat harvest. </p><p> </p><p>7.   The local guard at the silo complex was concerned that </p><p>other silo employees had received the USD 20 payment and the </p><p>subsequent USD 30 emergency payments, but he had received </p><p>nothing.  As guards were apparently not listed on the former </p><p>regime\'s payrolls, they did not receive payments.  DART Team </p><p>North reports it has heard this concern time and again from </p><p>security guards.  (Comment:  This non-payment issue is </p><p>ironic because the silo guards seem to be the only warehouse </p><p>and silo employees who continually report for a full </p><p>workday.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>As Sulaymaniyah PDS Distributions and Assessments </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>8.   DART Team North Food Officer traveled to As </p><p>Sulaymaniyah governorate on 10-11 June, and visited </p><p>locations including Chwarta, Penjwin, Halabja and the former </p><p>Ansar al-Islam areas of Biara and Tewalla.  The head of </p><p>WFP\'s sub-office in As Sulaymaniyah reported that PDS </p><p>distributions were proceeding efficiently, and that May\'s </p><p>wheat flour distributions were approximately 65 percent </p><p>complete.  Other food ration commodities are delayed pending </p><p>secondary transport contracted by the local authorities and </p><p>paid for by the food agents.  Once the wheat flour </p><p>distribution is nearly complete, transport availability will </p><p>increase, and the additional food ration commodities can be </p><p>distributed within a short period. </p><p> </p><p>9.   The head of WFP\'s sub-office in As Sulaymaniyah stated </p><p>that WFP staff in the three northern governorates wants to </p><p>begin to incorporate detailed vulnerability assessments into </p><p>its monthly monitoring.  The assessments will determine </p><p>where needs may continue after the PDS ends, and if in fact </p><p>there are still critical needs to be met.  DART Team North </p><p>supports WFP\'s interest in conducting vulnerability </p><p>assessments.  These assessments provide an excellent </p><p>opportunity for WFP to begin looking at future needs while </p><p>still having a large experienced team in place already </p><p>monitoring needs on a regular basis. </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Chwarta/Penjwin/Halabja </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  According to the DART Team North food officer, farmers </p><p>and other beneficiaries in the eastern As Sulaymaniyah </p><p>governorate towns of Chwarta, Penjwin, and Halabjah reported </p><p>that they had received only wheat flour from WFP since </p><p>March.  Some but not all farmers were aware of the $105 per </p><p>MT wheat offer for this year\'s harvest.  A significant </p><p>number of farmers stated that they would not sell their </p><p>wheat for this price, given the high costs for harvesting </p><p>the grain and transporting it (up to 200 kilometers) for </p><p>sale in Kirkuk, the nearest sanctioned reception site.  A </p><p>number of farmers reported that any wheat available above </p><p>the level necessary to feed their families would become </p><p>fodder for their livestock.  Penjwin is located on the </p><p>Iranian border, but local farmers reported that there is </p><p>very little cross-border trading for selling their wheat </p><p>inside Iran. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Former Ansar Areas: Biara/Tewella </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Ansar al-Islam was a radical Islamic group that </p><p>controlled a number of villages on the Iranian border, </p><p>including the towns of Biara and Tewella.  These areas were </p><p>isolated from the rest of Kurdistan, so visitors and traders </p><p>were not able to easily access the area, but WFP commodities </p><p>were regularly permitted entry.  DART Team North food </p><p>officer reports that there appears to be very little </p><p>commercial or other business activity in these areas. </p><p>Locals stated that trade with Iran is nearly non-existent, </p><p>although many homes in the border town of Tewella did have </p><p>satellite dishes.  According to residents, Ansar al-Islam </p><p>had Turkish, Bangladeshi, Afghani, Syrian, and Palestinian </p><p>elements, including Kurds, until they were recently forcibly </p><p>evicted.  Being isolated from the remainder of Iraqi </p><p>Kurdistan, the Islamic authorities had reportedly banned </p><p>alcohol, music, and satellite TV, except apparently for the </p><p>Al Jazeera channel.  Even smoking and participating in </p><p>sports were forbidden.  Most of the Ansar group were said to </p><p>have now fled into Iran, only meters from Tewella town. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Tewella residents expressed concern that food </p><p>commodities were delayed due to the need to contract "PUK" </p><p>vehicles.  As stated above, secondary transport is </p><p>contracted by the local authorities on behalf of the food </p><p>agents, and therefore is often seen as PUK-friendly </p><p>transporters.  DART Team North will assess whether the need </p><p>to contract PUK vehicles is indeed causing transport delays. </p><p>Approximately 200 families from Biara are currently living </p><p>in tents outside the town due to the recent fighting that </p><p>destroyed their homes. </p><p> </p><p>13.  WFP staff also noted that even in the former Ansar al- </p><p>Islam areas of control, WFP was always able to deliver food </p><p>through local transporters, though WFP staff was unable to </p><p>monitor distributions.  The PKK, the Turkish Kurd rebel </p><p>group, has some supporters in the far northern governorate </p><p>of As Sulaymaniyah, and the area remains a dangerous place. </p><p>The WFP staff is still unable to access deep into these </p><p>areas for monitoring purposes, although deliveries do </p><p>continue. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
