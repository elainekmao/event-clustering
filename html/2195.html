FAULK FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY\'S ANNUAL </p><p>CONFERENCE HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 13-16 IN </p><p>VICTORIA FALLS.  NO MAJOR CHANGES IN THE ZANU-PF </p><p>LEADERSHIP ARE EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED, AND THE </p><p>CONFERENCE IS LIKELY TO REAFFIRM PRESIDENT MUGABE AS THE </p><p>PARTY\'S CANDIDATE FOR NEXT YEAR\'S ELECTION.  OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS TELL US THAT THE DATES OF THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ANNOUNCED UNTIL AFTER </p><p>ZANU-PF WRAPS UP ITS ANNUAL DOG AND PONY SHOW.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN THE WORKS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) FRED SHAVA, ZANU-PF\'S DIRECTOR OF </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, CONFIRMED WITH POLOFF ON NOVEMBER 13 </p><p>THAT ZANU-PF\'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD IN </p><p>VICTORIA FALLS DECEMBER 13-16.  ABOUT 7,000 DELEGATES </p><p>REPRESENTING ALL 10 PROVINCES (THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILS </p><p>WILL SELECT THEIR DELEGATES OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS) </p><p>WILL BE ASSEMBLED UNDER A GIGANTIC TENT ON THE GOLF </p><p>COURSE OF A LOCAL RESORT.  HARARE DIPLOMATS WILL BE </p><p>INVITED TO ATTEND THE OPENING CEREMONY -- LIKELY TO BE </p><p>HELD DECEMBER 14, A DAY AFTER REGISTRATION IS COMPLETED </p><p>-- AND EMBASSIES SHOULD RECEIVE THEIR INVITATIONS BY THE </p><p>END OF THE MONTH, THE DIRECTOR NOTED.  SHAVA DESCRIBED </p><p>THE CONFERENCE AS THE PARTY\'S ANNUAL "MANAGEMENT </p><p>REVIEW," WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM A FIVE-YEAR CONGRESS. </p><p>A CONGRESS IS TASKED WITH ELECTING THE PARTY\'S 280- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03410  01 OF 02  151326Z </p><p>MEMBER CENTRAL COMMITTEE, WHEREAS NO LEADERSHIP CHANGES </p><p>CAN BE MADE AT A CONFERENCE, SHAVA ASSERTED.  DEPUTY </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER PAUL MANGWANA TOLD POLOFF NOVEMBER 1 </p><p>THAT IT IS AGAINST ZANU-PF\'S CONSTITUTION TO CHANGE THE </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP OUTSIDE OF A FIVE-YEAR CONGRESS. </p><p>CHANGES IN THE POLITBURO WERE MADE AT LAST YEAR\'S </p><p>CONGRESS ONLY BECAUSE THE PARTY CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN </p><p>CHANGED TO PERMIT IT.  (NOTE: LAST YEAR\'S ANNUAL </p><p>GATHERING QUALIFIED AS A "SPECIAL" CONGRESS TO CONCLUDE </p><p>UNFINISHED BUSINESS FROM 1999\'S FIVE-YEAR CONGRESS.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS YEAR\'S AGENDA, SHAVA COYLY </p><p>REMARKED THAT IT HAS NOT COME OUT YET, BUT SAID A </p><p>"REAFFIRMATION" OF MUGABE\'S CANDIDACY FOR NEXT YEAR\'S </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS LIKELY. </p><p> </p><p>A FEW LAST-MINUTE ADJUSTMENTS? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE OCTOBER 26 EDITION OF THE "ZIMBABWE </p><p>INDEPENDENT" CLAIMED THAT THE ZANU-PF POLITBURO WILL BE </p><p>EXPANDED AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE TO BRING IN MORE HELP </p><p>FOR THE ELECTION.  THE ARTICLE CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>COMMISSARIAT, WHICH DIRECTS ELECTION EFFORTS, WILL BE </p><p>EXPANDED WITH TWO NEW DEPUTY SECRETARIES, INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO WILL HEAD A NEW INFORMATION, </p><p>EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AND COMMISSARIAT SUB-COMMITTEE, AND </p><p>NICHOLAS GOCHE WILL DIRECT A NEW TRANSPORT AND SECURITY </p><p>SUB-COMMITTEE.  IDEN WETHERELL, EDITOR OF THE </p><p>"INDEPENDENT," TOLD POLOFF NOVEMBER 6 THAT NOW IS NOT </p><p>THE TIME FOR MUGABE TO REDUCE THE POLITBURO OR PUNISH </p><p>ENEMIES WITHIN THE PARTY -- HE NEEDS ALL THE HELP HE CAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03410  01 OF 02  151326Z </p><p>GET.  THE ZANU-PF POLITBURO NOW FUNCTIONS AS THE </p><p>NATION\'S CABINET -- THE REAL CABINET, IN MUGABE\'S VIEW, </p><p>IS FILLED WITH "WEAKLINGS AND LIGHTWEIGHTS" -- AND IT </p><p>WILL BE EXPANDED TO MEET THE ELECTORAL CHALLENGE AHEAD, </p><p>WETHERELL OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN SPEAKING TO ACTING PARTY COMMISSAR SIKHANYISO </p><p>NDLOVU ON NOVEMBER 8, POLOFFS LEARNED THAT MUGABE </p><p>PROBABLY WILL APPOINT A NEW COMMISSAR AT THE ZANU-PF </p><p>CONFERENCE, BUT NDLOVU REFUSED TO SPECULATE WHETHER IT </p><p>WOULD BE HIM.  WHEN ASKED IF NEW YOUTH DEVELOPMENT </p><p>MINISTER ELLIOT MANYIKA WAS FAVORED FOR THE KEY POST, </p><p>NDLOVU SAID HE WAS A POSSIBILITY.  WITH A TOUCH OF </p><p>BITTERNESS, THE ACTING COMMISSAR COMPLAINED ABOUT </p><p>WORKING FOR FORMER COMMISSAR BORDER GEZI, WHO DIED IN AN </p><p>APRIL CAR ACCIDENT.  HE DESCRIBED GEZI AS UNEDUCATED AND </p><p>IMMATURE.  NDLOVU NOTED THAT HE WAS NOW CONDUCTING A </p><p>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF ZIMBABWE\'S DEMOGRAPHICS TO LEARN </p><p>WHICH AREAS AND GROUPS ARE BEST TO TARGET FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS WERE RUN BASED ON THE OUTDATED 1992 CENSUS, </p><p>BUT THAT MISTAKE WOULD NOT BE MADE THIS TIME, HE ASSURED </p><p>US. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8285 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03410  02 OF 02  151326Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------3EA740  151326Z /38 </p><p>P 151242Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0287 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003410 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/15/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: FEW CHANGES EXPECTED AT UPCOMING </p><p>ZANU-PF CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION DATE STILL A MYSTERY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03410  02 OF 02  151326Z </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE TIMING OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, DIRECTOR SHAVA STATED THAT IT WAS </p><p>"ENTIRELY UP TO THE PRESIDENT\'S DISCRETION."  HE REFUSED </p><p>TO ELABORATE ON WHEN THE DATE MIGHT BE ANNOUNCED, </p><p>STATING THAT THE WINDOW FOR THE ELECTION WAS WELL- </p><p>DEFINED BY THE CONSTITUTION.  SHAVA THEN VOLUNTEERED </p><p>THAT IT IS WITHIN THE PRESIDENT\'S AUTHORITY TO DELAY AN </p><p>ELECTION, AND EFFECTIVELY EXTEND HIS TENURE, IF THE </p><p>COUNTRY IS AT WAR, THERE IS A NATURAL DISASTER THAT </p><p>PREVENTS VOTERS FROM GOING TO THE POLLS, OR A STATE OF </p><p>EMERGENCY IS DECLARED.  IDEN WETHERELL REMARKED THAT HE </p><p>DOES NOT BELIEVE MUGABE WILL ANNOUNCE THE ELECTION DATE </p><p>DURING THE ZANU-PF CONFERENCE BECAUSE HE "DOESN\'T WANT </p><p>TO PUT ALL HIS CARDS ON THE TABLE."  INSTEAD, HE WILL </p><p>WAIT AS LONG AS LEGALLY POSSIBLE.  MUGABE WILL STAND FOR </p><p>RE-ELECTION, THE EDITOR OFFERED, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT </p><p>IS CONVINCED THAT HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SEE "THE </p><p>REVOLUTION" THROUGH.  NDLOVU TOLD US A MARCH DATE HAD </p><p>BEEN RECOMMENDED TO THE PRESIDENT BUT THAT MUGABE HAS </p><p>NOT YET MADE A DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THIS YEAR\'S ZANU-PF CONFERENCE IS SHAPING UP TO </p><p>BE AN EVEN BIGGER NON-EVENT THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. </p><p>GONE ARE EVEN THE USUAL RUMORS OF WHOLESALE CHANGES IN </p><p>THE PARTY LEADERSHIP OR "YOUNG TURK" REVOLTS.  ZANU-PF </p><p>MEMBERS APPEAR RESIGNED TO THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03410  02 OF 02  151326Z </p><p>MUGABE AT THE HELM AND ARE STAKING THEIR POLITICAL </p><p>FUTURES ON HIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY.  ALTHOUGH A FEW </p><p>MINOR RESHUFFLES OR ADDITIONS TO THE POLITBURO MAY OCCUR </p><p>-- ELLIOT MANYIKA LOOKS LIKE A SHOE-IN FOR PARTY </p><p>COMMISSAR -- MUGABE IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE TACK SO NEAR </p><p>THE END OF THE RACE, EVEN IF THE BOAT IS TAKING ON </p><p>WATER.  THE CONFERENCE WILL LIKELY SERVE AS ANOTHER </p><p>AVENUE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO WHIP UP SUPPORT FOR HIS LAND </p><p>PROGRAM AND TO REENERGIZE THE PARTY FAITHFUL.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
