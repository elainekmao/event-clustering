<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOGADISHU 11003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINS, PHUM, MOPS, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  DISCUSSION WITH MANIFESTO SIGNERS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2.  ON DECEMBER 17, DCM HOSTED A LUNCHEON FOR </p><p>SEVERAL SIGNERS OF THE MAY MANIFESTO.  THEY ARE: </p><p>GENERAL ABDULAHI MOHAMED HASSAN, FORMER COMMANDER </p><p>OF THE SOMALI POLICE AND A MAJERTAIN (BIO DETAILS </p><p>FOLLOW SEPTEL); MOHAMOUD SALAH NOOR, ADOLBAHANTE </p><p>AND FORMER LABOR OFFICIAL; ABDULAZIZ NOOR HERSI, </p><p>A LAWYER AND MEMBER OF THE MAJERTAIN CLAN, </p><p>AND MOHAMED GIAMA, A MAJERTAIN AND FORMER AMBASSADOR </p><p>TO THE EC AND FORMER MINISTER OF COMMERCE.  ALSO </p><p>PRESENT WERE OSMAN SAMANTAR, A PROMINENT MAJERTAIN </p><p>BUSINESSMAN, AMBASSADOR BISHOP AND POLOFF. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  PEACEFUL RECONCILIATION.  THE GUESTS WERE </p><p>DISCOURAGED BY THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE CAIRO </p><p>ROUND TABLE TALKS, AND BLAMED IT ON THE GSDR </p><p>FOR HAVING ISSUED A STRICT NEW SECURITY DECREE </p><p>AND HAVING ARRESTED SEVERAL MANIFESTO SIGNERS </p><p>(NOTE.  AMBASSADOR GIAMA WAS ONE OF THREE </p><p>MANIFESTO SIGNERS DETAINED FOR APPROXIMATELY </p><p>TWO DAYS DURING THE VIOLENCE IN MOGADISHU TWO </p><p>WEEKS AGO).  ALTHOUGH THOSE DETAINED WERE NOW FREE, </p><p>THE GROUP MADE CLEAR THAT DIALOGUE WITH THE GSDR </p><p>WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS THE SECURITY DECREE </p><p>IS IN FORCE.  MOREOVER, THEY SAID, THEY HAD </p><p>RECEIVED NO INDICATION THAT CHARGES AGAINST </p><p>THE DETAINEES HAD BEEN DROPPED. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  THE MANIFESTO GROUP HAD BELIEVED THE NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTION TO BE A STEP FORWARD; BUT NOW, THEY </p><p>SAID, PRESIDENT SIAD HAD BLOCKED THE PATH OF </p><p>PEACEFUL RECONCILIATION, LEAVING ONLY VIOLENCE </p><p>AS A MEANS OF RESOLVING SOMALIA\'S CRISIS. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THEY STILL BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT </p><p>A PEACEFUL, NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  ROLE OF THE U.S.  THE GROUP EXPRESSED THANKS </p><p>FOR THE USG HAVING CUT AID TO THE GSDR.  BY CONTRAST, </p><p>THEY CRITICIZED THE GULF STATES AND ITALY FOR THEIR </p><p>CONTINUED AID TO THE SIAD GOVERNMENT.  THEY ASKED </p><p>THE U.S. TO PERSUADE THE GULF STATES NOT TO AID THE </p><p>GSDR, AT LEAST NOT BY GIVING CASH, WHICH IS USED </p><p>ONLY FOR WEAPONS PURCHASES AND PERSONAL ENRICHMENT. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THE LOGIC BEHIND THE GULF </p><p>STATES AIDING THOSE GOVERNMENTS THAT SUPPORT THE </p><p>POSITION OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND THAT HAVE BEEN </p><p>HURT ECONOMICALLY BY THE GULF CRISIS.  HE ALSO </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE GULF STATES ANNOUNCED THEIR </p><p>USD 70 MILLION AID FOR SOMALIA AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM LOOKED MORE PROMISING THAN </p><p>IT DOES NOW. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  THE GUESTS ALSO ASKED THE U.S. TO CONTINUE </p><p>TO PERSUADE BOTH THE GSDR AND THE VARIOUS </p><p>OPPOSITION GROUPS TO NEGOTIATE WITH ONE ANOTHER. </p><p>MOHAMOUD SALAH NOOR DISAGREED WITH THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>REMARK THAT U.S. INFLUENCE WITH THE GSDR WAS NOW </p><p>LIMITED PRECISELY BECAUSE WE HAD SLASHED AID. </p><p>NOOR MAINTAINED THAT THE OPPOSITE WAS TRUE: WITHOUT </p><p>U.S. AID, SIAD\'S POSITION WAS MORE DESPERATE THAN </p><p>EVER.  HE WOULD THUS BE WILLING TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING </p><p>TO GET THE MONEY FLOWING AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.  FEDERALISM AND SOMALIA.  THE GUESTS ALL </p><p>SEEMED TO HAVE READ DAS HICKS\' SPEECH ON </p><p>FEDERALISM AND THE HORN OF AFRICA (USIS HAS </p><p>DISTRIBUTED MORE THAN 100 COPIES, AND CONTINUES </p><p>TO RECEIVE REQUESTS FOR MORE).  DESPITE ARGUMENT </p><p>TO THE CONTRARY, ALL SOMALIS PRESENT SEEMED TO </p><p>EQUATE FEDERALISM WITH PARTITION, WHICH THEY DO NOT </p><p>WANT FOR SOMALIA.  ONE PARTICIPANT MAINTAINED THAT A </p><p>FEDERAL SYSTEM WOULD INVITE THE SNM AND OTHERS BENT ON </p><p>SECESSION TO DESTROY THE UNITY OF SOMALIA. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  THE MILITARY SITUATION.  SAMANTAR, WHO IS </p><p>A CLANSMAN AND CLOSE FRIEND OF GENERAL MORGAN, </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE GENERAL HAD LEFT MOGADISHU FOR </p><p>THE CENTRAL REGIONS ON DECEMBER 16, ACCOMPANYING </p><p>TWO CONTAINERS FILLED WITH SOMALI SHILLINGS (SOSH). </p><p>THE MONEY, ACCORDING TO SAMANTAR, WOULD BE DISHED </p><p>OUT 100,000 SOSH PER DEAD BODY, TO THOSE WHO KILLED </p><p>THE ENEMY.  SAMANTAR SAID MORGAN HAD ONLY 1,000 </p><p>POORLY-TRAINED RECRUITS AT HIS COMMAND FOR HIS </p><p>CENTRAL REGION OFFENSIVE.  MOST OF THEM ARE OGADENI, </p><p>HOT TO REVENGE HAWIYE ATTACKS ON THEIR REFUGEE </p><p>CAMPS IN THE CENTRAL REGION. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>9.  SAMANTAR ALSO CLAIMED THAT GENERAL MORGAN </p><p>WOULD SOON TRAVEL TO CAIRO, AND THAT THE ROUND </p><p>TABLE TALKS WOULD BE RESCHEDULED FOR MID-JANUARY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>10.  COMMENT.  LATER THE SAME DAY, THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR TOLD AMBASSADOR BISHOP THAT THE GOE </p><p>WOULD SOON LAUNCH A UNILATERAL PEACE INITIATIVE, </p><p>CONSISTING OF INVITING THE VARIOUS PARTIES OF </p><p>THE SOMALI CONFLICT ONE-BY-ONE TO CAIRO FOR </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MORGAN\'S VISIT </p><p>TO CAIRO WILL FALL WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK.  ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, HE MIGHT SIMPLY INTEND TO ASK FOR ARMS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>11.  WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING CONFLICTING INFORMATION </p><p>ON THE PROGRESS OF GENERAL MORGAN\'S OFFENSIVE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH NONE OF IT POINTS TO SUCCESS.  NUMEROUS </p><p>SOMALI ARMY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN FLOWING BACK INTO </p><p>MOGADISHU AND THERE ARE REPORTS OF RENEWED FIGHTING </p><p>NEAR JOHAR AND MAHADE WEYNE, ABOUT 100 KM FROM THE </p><p>CAPITAL. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>12.  THE GROUP\'S RESPONSE TO DAS HICKS\' SPEECH IS </p><p>TYPICAL OF THOSE WE HAVE RECEIVED SO FAR:  PLEASURE </p><p>THAT SOMEONE IS GIVING SERIOUS THOUGHT TO THE </p><p>HORN AND ITS PROBLEMS, GREAT INTEREST IN THE SPEECH, </p><p>BUT STRONG RESISTANCE TO THE IDEA OF FEDERALISM FOR </p><p>THIS COUNTRY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
