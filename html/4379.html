Summary: President Mugabe\'s fast track land reform ranks </p><p>among the most emotionally-charged and polemical policies in </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s 22-year history.  Given the small number of new </p><p>farmers who have taken control of plots, the undermining of </p><p>due process, the politicized and untransparent manner of </p><p>reallocation, the resulting food crisis and losses in </p><p>productivity, employment and export earnings, it is </p><p>difficult to view the program as anything but a short-term </p><p>failure. It is unclear, but doubtful, if the longer-term </p><p>outlook will be better.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Problems on the Farms </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2. The Mugabe government argues that the country could not </p><p>escape some transitional discomfort as it passed farmland </p><p>from white to black ownership.  It has already declared land </p><p>reform a success based on the number of farms allocated to </p><p>black Zimbabweans, figures we will review septel.  The </p><p>government is also quick to point out that Zimbabwe already </p><p>has a working model for communal farming that yields, in a </p><p>rainy year, more than half the country\'s corn production. </p><p>After having spoken with several agricultural experts and </p><p>visiting some new communal farms, we nonetheless see nothing </p><p>but problems in the near-term: </p><p> </p><p>- Loss of Tobacco Revenue.  Because it is a capital- </p><p>intensive, sophisticated crop, few new farmers occupying </p><p>former commercial tobacco farms will continue to grow this </p><p>cash crop.  This is a tragic loss for a country that became </p><p>the world\'s top tobacco exporter in the late-1990s. </p><p>Production will have dropped next year from 232 to as low as </p><p>70 million kg since 2000, according to the Zimbabwe Tobacco </p><p>Association.  Tobacco was the private sector\'s largest </p><p>employer, and Zimbabwe\'s largest foreign exchange earner. </p><p>At the same time, tobacco took up only 3 percent of the </p><p>country\'s arable land, using sandy areas not ideally-suited </p><p>for corn, so the trade-off in land gain for new farms is </p><p>modest.  Raising corn in these sandy areas will also require </p><p>extra fertilizer, a heavy burden on new farmers.  (All of </p><p>the calcium and one-third of the ammonium nitrate used in </p><p>fertilizer is not produced domestically and quite expensive </p><p>at present.) </p><p> </p><p>- Destruction and Ecological Damage.  Former commercial </p><p>farms now resemble a war-zone.  "War Veterans" and others </p><p>who took over the farms burnt crops, killed livestock, </p><p>poached or snared wildlife, felled trees (including the </p><p>common mopane that require two centuries to mature in </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s arid conditions) and destroyed high-tech farm </p><p>equipment.  This is devastation that, in the best of </p><p>circumstances, will take decades to overcome. </p><p> </p><p>- Low Interest or Skills of New Farmers.  In a typical </p><p>former commercial farm, based on our observation, only 15-25 </p><p>percent of assigned plots are actually occupied.  Some new </p><p>farmers, often urbanites, have already given up trying to </p><p>raise crops, while others are simply unwilling to take up </p><p>residence there.  On smaller A1 or even larger A2 farms, it </p><p>is rare to see even four rows of crop.  The GoZ has not </p><p>enforced deadlines for new A2 farmers to take residence on </p><p>redistributed land. </p><p> </p><p>- Displaced Workers.   At the same time, hundreds of </p><p>thousands of farm workers are now unemployed.  (They were </p><p>almost never offered new farms.)   To varying degrees, </p><p>commercial farms had provided workers with adequate food and </p><p>housing (often with electricity and plumbing).  Commercial </p><p>tobacco farms alone may have housed 2-3 percent of the </p><p>country\'s population.  Many were born on the commercial </p><p>farms and will be unable to find new jobs, an enormous and </p><p>lasting economic burden. </p><p> </p><p>- Lack of Creditworthiness of New Farmers.  Most new farmers </p><p>are unable to borrow enough to finance production.  This </p><p>seems to apply as much to larger A2 as to smaller A1 farms. </p><p>The GoZ has not given title to the new farmers, depriving </p><p>them of their most important collateral. </p><p> </p><p>- Absence of Farming Inputs.  Without collateral, new </p><p>farmers are unable to acquire the necessary inputs for </p><p>farming.  Given fertilizer\'s imported components and the </p><p>Zimdollars\' rapid devaluation, the cost of fertilizer has </p><p>increased 7-fold in a year.  Seed supply is also low due to </p><p>the disruption of seed-producing commercial farms.  As a </p><p>result, new farmers are dependent on the GoZ for input </p><p>assistance.  In the Nov 14 budget presentation, the GoZ </p><p>proposed an additional Z$ 15 billion (US$  9 million) to </p><p>assist new farmers, but it is difficult to imagine how this </p><p>small amount of money will make much of a difference. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>----------- </p><p>3. In economic terms, fast-track land reform has been a </p><p>disaster for almost all concerned.  Commercial farm workers </p><p>are destined for chronic unemployment.  Zimbabwean consumers </p><p>must now pay higher prices than ever for staples such as </p><p>corn, whose production dropped from 2.15 million tons in </p><p>1999/2000 to 500,000 tons in 2001/02, drought admittedly </p><p>playing some part in the precipitous decline.  White </p><p>commercial farmers became among the most productive </p><p>agrarians in the world; in a matter of months, they have </p><p>lost nearly everything.  New settlers seem unable to raise </p><p>enough food for even their own consumption and generally </p><p>live in crude shacks with no amenities.  Only a smaller </p><p>group of settlers, often political, police or civil service </p><p>higher-ups, have done well, acquiring larger plots or well- </p><p>appointed former family farmhouses. </p><p> </p><p>4. Will the new farms ever become productive?  If the GoZ </p><p>grants new farmers titles to their properties, allows farms </p><p>to freely change hands, eventually falling to "new farmers" </p><p>willing to actually farm, we could envision these </p><p>enterprises one day reaching subsistence levels with modest </p><p>surplus for domestic sale.   For one who places the greatest </p><p>stock in indigenous ownership, this may qualify land reform </p><p>as a success.  However, more profitable crops and economies </p><p>of scale -- the keys to export earnings -- will only return </p><p>if the GoZ adopts another framework for land reform that can </p><p>provide the foundation for a functioning formal economy. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
