<p>S E C R E T THE HAGUE 001920 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PM, EUR/UBI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, CD, LI, ML, MR, NG, XY, NL, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: LIBERIA: DUTCH WILL CONTRIBUTE EURO 500,000 FOR </p><p>MALI VIA ECOWAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 219151 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/PolCouns Kami A. Witmer Reasons 1.5 (a), (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) Summary:  The GoNL plans to contribute euro 500,000 </p><p>via ECOWAS to Mali to support Mali\'s military contribution to </p><p>an ECOWAS force in Liberia.  Such financial support will be </p><p>dependent upon a "believable arrangement" that Taylor will </p><p>leave country and will not be absolved of his war crimes </p><p>indictment from the Special Court for Sierra Leone.  The </p><p>Dutch are also prepared to donate euro 500,000 for </p><p>humanitarian assistance via UN and/or established </p><p>humanitarian organizations once stability is reached.  Dutch </p><p>military support is unlikely.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) PolOff and DATT delivered reftel to MFA Marc </p><p>Bentinck, MFA Division head for Conflict Prevention, Peace </p><p>Operations, and Military and Civil Cooperation, and R. van </p><p>der Veen, Deputy Director for West Africa.  Bentinck stated </p><p>the Government of Mali recently approached the GoNL, asking </p><p>for financial support of Mali\'s military contribution to an </p><p>ECOWAS mission.  The GoNL is prepared to donate euro 500,000 </p><p>to fulfill this request.  However, the Dutch insist that the </p><p>contribution go through ECOWAS.  To date, the GoNL has </p><p>not/not received a formal request from ECOWAS.  Upon receipt </p><p>of such request, the Dutch could provide funding within a </p><p>matter of days.  Van der Veen said that the GoNL will attach </p><p>two conditions to its contribution.  Taylor must leave, or </p><p>there must be a "believable arrangement" that he will depart </p><p>country.  Secondly, his departure cannot include any </p><p>arrangement that would negate his indictment for war crimes </p><p>under the Special Court for Sierra Leone. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) Due to participation in other overseas military </p><p>operations and defense budget cuts, Bentinck does not </p><p>anticipate a GoNL military contribution to an international </p><p>coalition of peacekeeping forces in Liberia at this time. </p><p>(Note:  Post concurs with this assessment; military support </p><p>from the Dutch is unlikely.)  He will, nevertheless, discuss </p><p>options within the GoNL.  Bentinck was open to the DATT\'s </p><p>suggestion to at least consider providing airlift support on </p><p>an ad-hoc basis in the future. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) The Dutch have set aside euro 500,000 for </p><p>humanitarian assistance for Liberia.  It is prepared to </p><p>contribute such funds via UN or other established </p><p>humanitarian agencies once the situation on the ground is </p><p>stable.  Van der Veen commented that additional financial </p><p>assistance might be possible in the future. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
