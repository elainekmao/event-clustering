REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE UN ANNOUNCED AT A DONORS\' MEETING </p><p>JUNE 9 THAT IT WAS WITHDRAWING ITS ELECTORAL SUPPORT UNIT. </p><p>THE UN CITED THREE REASONS: CHANGES IN ELECTORAL </p><p>REGULATIONS GIVING A GOZ BODY CONTROL OVER ACCREDITATION </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, WHICH THE UN HAD PLANNED TO </p><p>COORDINATE; A NOTE VERBALE FROM THE GOVERNMENT ASKING THE </p><p>UN TO FIELD AN OBSERVER MISSION, A ROLE IT SAYS IT HAD </p><p>NEVER OFFERED OR EXPECTED TO PLAY; AND THE SLOWNESS OF </p><p>DONORS TO PROVIDE FULL ASSISTANCE FOR THE UN MISSION.  THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF THE UN MISSION IN ITSELF IS NOT AN </p><p>INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM FROM A LOGISTICAL POINT OF VIEW, </p><p>SINCE THE EU HAS OFFERED TO PROVIDE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO </p><p>SMALLER MISSIONS.  HOWEVER, THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED BY THE </p><p>PROPOSED UN COORDINATING FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY </p><p>COMPROMISED AS NO SINGLE DONOR CAN DO THIS FOR ALL THE TEN </p><p>MISSIONS.  SPECIFICALLY, THE CIVIL SOCIETY-INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION INTERFACE, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR JOINT </p><p>BRIEFINGS/DEBRIEFINGS, AND SHARING OF DRAFT STATEMENTS NOW </p><p>WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO </p><p>ACCOMPLISH.  SOME INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS BELIEVE, </p><p>PLAUSIBLY IN OUR VIEW, THAT THE SUDDEN ISSUANCE OF THE </p><p>ELECTION REGULATIONS, AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S LACK OF CLARITY </p><p>ON WHAT THEY MEAN IN PRACTICAL TERMS, REPRESENT A </p><p>DELIBERATE EFFORT ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S PART TO IMPEDE THE </p><p>WORK OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  AT A DONORS\' MEETING JUNE 9, UNDP RESREP CARLOS </p><p>LOPES ANNOUNCED THAT THE UN ELECTORAL ASSISTANCE MISSION </p><p>WAS PLANNING TO SHUT DOWN.  LOPES CITED THREE REASONS FOR </p><p>THE MISSION\'S WITHDRAWAL: </p><p> </p><p>1) NEW ELECTORAL REGULATIONS GAZETTED BY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>JUNE 7 HAD ASSIGNED TO THE ELECTION DIRECTORATE, AN INTER- </p><p>MINISTERIAL GOZ BODY, RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACCREDITING </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS (REFTEL).  THE UN HAD ANTICIPATED THAT </p><p>IT WOULD COORDINATE THE ACCREDITATION OF OBSERVERS, SUBJECT </p><p>TO APPROVAL BY THE ELECTION DIRECTORATE OR ANOTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENT BODY. </p><p> </p><p>2) THE GOZ HAD, IN A JUNE 8 NOTE VERBALE, ASKED THE UN FOR </p><p>THE FIRST TIME TO FIELD AN ELECTION OBSERVER MISSION -- A </p><p>ROLE THAT THE UN SAYS IT HAD NEVER PLANNED, OR WANTED, TO </p><p>PLAY.  DESPITE THE UN\'S LONGSTANDING (SINCE DECEMBER) </p><p>POSITION THAT IT WOULD NOT PLAY A FORMAL LEADERSHIP ROLE </p><p>FOR THE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS (IO\'S), DONORS HAD ASKED </p><p>UNDP TO PLAY A COORDINATING ROLE AND TO NEGOTIATE A </p><p>FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT WITH THE GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>3) DONORS WERE STILL SOME USD 55,000 SHORT OF THE USD </p><p>400,000 BUDGET FOR THE ELECTION ASSISTANCE UNIT.  HOWEVER, </p><p>IF THE UN HAD STAYED, THE FUNDING WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED, </p><p>SINCE THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT DECIDED ON JUNE 9 THAT IT </p><p>WOULD MEET ANY SHORTFALL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  LOPES TOLD THE DONORS THAT THE INSTRUCTION TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03166  01 OF 02  131551Z </p><p>TERMINATE THE ELECTORAL SUPPORT OPERATION HAD COME DIRECTLY </p><p>FROM THE UNSYG.  UNDP HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED BY NEW YORK NOT </p><p>EVEN TO PLAY THE TYPE OF COORDINATION ROLE IT MIGHT HAVE </p><p>PLAYED IN THE ABSENCE OF A UN ELECTION ASSISTANCE UNIT. </p><p>HOWEVER, LOPES SAID THAT UNDP WILL, AS USUAL, STILL HOST </p><p>PERIODIC INFORMAL INFORMATION MEETINGS OF DIPLOMATIC </p><p>MISSIONS TO ASSESS THE POLITICAL SITUATION.  THE EUROPEAN </p><p>UNION OBSERVER MISSION, WHICH HAS BY FAR THE LARGEST </p><p>DELEGATION (APPROXIMATELY 150 MEMBERS), HAS VOLUNTEERED TO </p><p>DO WHAT IT CAN TO FACILITATE COORDINATION AND TO PROVIDE </p><p>LOGISTICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALLER MISSIONS.  (NOTE: USAID </p><p>HAS OFFERED TO UNDP TO SUPPORT THE COSTS OF A SHARED IO </p><p>MISSION VENUE FOR MEETING AND COORDINATING DURING THE </p><p>ACTUAL POLLING DAYS.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE UN PULLOUT, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER MISSIONS HAVE STRUGGLED TO COMPLY </p><p>WITH NEW PROCEDURES FOR ACCREDITATION, WHICH ARE LENGTHY, </p><p>CUMBERSOME, AND UNCLEAR.  THE TEAM FROM THE NATIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE AND INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE </p><p>(NDI/IRI), WHICH UNLIKE OTHER MISSIONS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT DELEGATION, IS HAVING PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF ITS </p><p>NON-GOVERNMENTAL STATUS (SEPTEL).  DOMESTIC OBSERVERS ALSO </p><p>FACE NEW COMPLICATIONS.

OBSERVER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ARE STRUGGLING TO MOBILIZE THEIR MEMBERS TO </p><p>COMPLY WITH THIS REQUIREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  EMBASSY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>DEPARTURE OF THE UN ELECTORAL ASSISTANCE UNIT, IN ITSELF, </p><p>WILL HAVE MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON THE OBSERVER MISSIONS FROM A </p><p>LOGISTICAL POINT OF VIEW.  MANY OF THE MISSIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE EU DELEGATION AND THE USAID-FUNDED IRI/NDI DELEGATION, </p><p>HAD PLANNED ALL ALONG TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE UN. </p><p>IN ADDITION, THE UN MISSION HAD GOTTEN OFF TO A BAD START </p><p>WITH DOMESTIC OBSERVERS, WHO WERE HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE </p><p>MISSION\'S UNWILLINGNESS TO PRESS FOR A STRONGER ROLE FOR </p><p>THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION IN THE OBSERVER </p><p>ACCREDITATION PROCESS (REFTEL).  HOWEVER, THE OPPORTUNITY </p><p>PROVIDED BY THE PROPOSED UN COORDINATING FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN </p><p>SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED AS NO SINGLE DONOR CAN DO THIS FOR </p><p>ALL THE IO MISSIONS.  SPECIFICALLY, THE CIVIL SOCIETY-IO </p><p>INTERFACE, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR JOINT BRIEFINGS/DEBRIEFINGS, </p><p>AND SHARING OF DRAFT STATEMENTS NOW WILL BE EXTREMELY </p><p>DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOMPLISH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  FURTHERMORE, THE GOZ\'S LAST-MINUTE CHANGES HAVE </p><p>BROADER IMPLICATIONS.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE, PLAUSIBLY IN </p><p>OUR VIEW, THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S SUDDEN INTRODUCTION OF THE </p><p>NEW REGULATIONS, AND ITS SUBSEQUENT LACK OF CLARITY AS TO </p><p>HOW OBSERVERS ARE TO COMPLY WITH THEM, REPRESENT A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03166  02 OF 02  131552Z </p><p>DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO KEEP OBSERVERS FROM DOING AN </p><p>EFFECTIVE JOB OF MONITORING THE POLITICAL SITUATION.  CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY CONTACTS BELIEVE THE GOZ\'S GOAL, IN PART, WAS TO </p><p>IMPEDE THE CHANCES OF A PERCEIVED UN-LED CONDEMNATION OF </p><p>THE ELECTIONS AS NOT FREE AND FAIR.  THE GOZ\'S ACTIONS HAVE </p><p>FURTHER ENSURED THAT EACH MISSION WILL ISSUE ITS OWN, AND </p><p>POSSIBLY LESS COORDINATED, STATEMENT ON THE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  IN OUR VIEW THE UN MADE THE RIGHT DECISION GIVEN </p><p>THE TIMING OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE ELECTION REGULATIONS </p><p>AND THE GOZ\'S CHANGED GOALPOST FOR THE UN ROLE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
