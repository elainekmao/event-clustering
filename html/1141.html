IRVING, DCM.  REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS AN ACTION REQUEST; </p><p>SEE PARAS 8-10. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  OBSERVER DELEGATIONS FROM THE </p><p>NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE (NDI) AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE (IRI) ARE </p><p>FACING BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES THAT SO FAR HAVE </p><p>PREVENTED THEM FROM RECEIVING ACCREDITATION FROM </p><p>THE GOZ.  BOTH GROUPS HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY WILL </p><p>HAVE TO REASSESS HOW TO PROCEED IF THEY DO NOT </p><p>RECEIVE ACCREDITATION SOON.  THE PROBLEMS STEM </p><p>FROM NEW ELECTORAL REGULATIONS (REFTEL) THAT </p><p>APPARENTLY PROVIDE NO MECHANISM FOR ACCREDITATION </p><p>OF FOREIGN NGO\'S.  A SENIOR MFA OFFICIAL, WHO WAS </p><p>AWARE OF THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL STATUS OF THE </p><p>IRI/NDI TEAMS, SUGGESTED TO DCM THAT THEY COULD </p><p>RECEIVE ACCREDITATION IF THE EMBASSY INCLUDED THE </p><p>GROUPS IN A DIPLOMATIC NOTE LISTING THEM AS </p><p>OFFICIAL USG OBSERVERS.  HOWEVER, THIS POSES A </p><p>NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS FOR BOTH THE USG AND </p><p>NOI/IRI, INCLUOING THE FACT THAT THE USG WOULD BE </p><p>IOENTIFIED WITH THE GROUPS\' CONCLUSIONS.  OTHER </p><p>POSSIBILITIES INCLUDE RAISING THE ISSUE WITH THE </p><p>ELECTION DIRECTORATE (TO WHICH MFA IS REFERRING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03168  01 OF 03  131650Z </p><p>NGO APPLICATIONS) AND OTHER RELEVANT OFFICIALS, </p><p>AND A USG ASSESSMENT THAT IT IS TOO LATE FOR </p><p>FURTHER INTERVENTION.  EMBASSY REQUESTS </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S GUIDANCE ON HOW TO PROCEED.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NEW REGULATIONS COMPLICATE ACCREDITATION </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE PUBLICATION OF NEW REGULATIONS </p><p>SETTING OUT ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES FOR ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVERS (REFTEL), AND THE LACK OF CLEAR </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE GOVERNMENT ON HOW TO COMPLY </p><p>WITH THEM, HAVE CREATED CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION ON </p><p>THE PART OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>OBTAIN ACCREDITATION.  MONITORING TEAMS DIRECTLY </p><p>AFFILIATED WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE 150- </p><p>STRONG EU OBSERVER MISSION, FACE A CUMBERSOME BUT </p><p>RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD PROCESS.  THEY ARE </p><p>REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE NAMES OF THEIR TEAM </p><p>MEMBERS UNDER COVER OF A DIPLOMATIC NOTE, RECEIVE </p><p>APPROVAL FROM THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, AND THEN </p><p>APPLY TO THE ELECTION DIRECTORATE (AN INTER- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL BODY WHICH OVERSEES THE </p><p>ACCREDITATION OFFICE) FOR CREDENTIALS.  EU </p><p>ACCREDITATION IS APPARENTLY PROCEEDING FAIRLY </p><p>SMOOTHLY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SEVERAL KENYANS, </p><p>WHOSE ELIGIBILITY TO TAKE PART IN THE DELEGATION </p><p>THE GOZ HAS QUESTIONED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  HOWEVER, THERE IS APPARENTLY NO PROCEDURE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03168  01 OF 03  131650Z </p><p>IN PLACE FOR REGISTRATION OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVER TEAMS WHICH ARE NOT OFFICIAL DELEGATIONS </p><p>OF GOVERNMENTS, MISSIONS, OR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  THIS INCLUDES THE NDI/IRI TEAMS, </p><p>WHICH ARE FUNDED BY USAID.  (NOTE: THERE IS A </p><p>PROCEDURE FOR REGISTRATION OF DOMESTIC NGO\'S, BUT </p><p>IT IS ONLY OPEN TO ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  WHEN IRI AND NDI REPORTED TO THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY FOR ACCREDITATION ON JUNE 12, THEY WERE </p><p>TOLD THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REGISTER </p><p>UNLESS THE EMBASSY SENT A LETTER INCLUDING THE </p><p>NAMES OF ALL AMERICAN OBSERVERS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>NDI/IRI TEAMS.  THE EMBASSY CALLED THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY SEVERAL TIMES THAT DAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>CLARIFY THE ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS, AND </p><p>RECEIVED A NUMBER OF CONTRADICTORY RESPONSES. </p><p> </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH MFA </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  DCM AND POLOFF CALLED ON DR. NGONI </p><p>CHIDEYA, DIRECTOR OF THE MFA\'S OFFICE ON EUROPE </p><p>AND THE AMERICAS, ON JUNE 13 TO ASK HOW THE </p><p>NDI/IRI TEAM\'S ACCREDITATION COULD BE </p><p>FACILITATED.

END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  MFA, CHIDEYA CONTINUED, HAS NO MECHANISM </p><p>FOR ACCREDITING FOREIGN NGO\'S.  HE NOTED THAT HE </p><p>HAD REFERRED, OR WAS PLANNING TO REFER, SEVERAL </p><p>SUCH APPLICATIONS FROM NGO\'S (INCLUDING ONE FROM </p><p>THE FRIEDRICH NAUMANN STIFTUNG, A GERMAN </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY-AFFILIATED NGO WITH FUNCTIONS </p><p>SIMILAR TO THOSE OF NDI AND IRI) TO THE ELECTION </p><p>DIRECTORATE FOR FURTHER ACTION.  CHIDEYA </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE GOZ WOULD BE ABLE TO APPROVE </p><p>ACCREDITATION FOR THE NDI/IRI TEAM MEMBERS IF </p><p>THEIR NAMES WERE SUBMITTED, ALONG WITH THOSE OF </p><p>EMBASSY PERSONNEL PLANNING TO ACT AS OBSERVERS, </p><p>UNDER COVER OF A DIPLOMATIC NOTE STATING THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03168  02 OF 03  131651Z </p><p>THESE PEOPLE CONSTITUTED AN OFFICIAL USG </p><p>DELEGATION.  (COMMENT:  WE ASSUME THAT THE REASON </p><p>THAT DR. CHIDEYA DID NOT REFER NDI AND IRI TO THE </p><p>ELECTION DIRECTORATE ALONG WITH OTHER NGO\'S WAS </p><p>HIS PURPORTED UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE PART </p><p>OF THE "OFFICIAL" USG DELEGATION.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>IRI\'S AND NDI\'S VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  DCM AND POLOFFS BRIEFED NDI AND IRI </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES ON THE MEETING WITH CHIDEYA JUNE </p><p>13.  BOTH ORGANIZATIONS TOLD US THAT BEING </p><p>PORTRAYED AS AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT DELEGATION </p><p>WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW. </p><p>BOTH IRI AND NDI TOLD US THAT IF THEY ARE NOT </p><p>ABLE TO REGISTER IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO THEY WILL </p><p>HAVE TO REASSESS THEIR PLANS.  A PARTICULAR WORRY </p><p>FOR IRI IS THE GOVERNMENT\'S RECENT DECISION TO </p><p>SHUT DOWN THE ACCREDITATION CENTER ON JUNE 22. </p><p>REGISTRATION IS A TWO-DAY PROCESS, FOR WHICH </p><p>OBSERVERS MUST BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT, AND THE IRI </p><p>OBSERVERS ARRIVING FROM OVERSEAS ARE NOT </p><p>CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE UNTIL JUNE 21. </p><p>NDI, FOR ITS PART, IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>SECURITY OF ITS OBSERVERS, WHO WERE ALREADY IN- </p><p>COUNTRY WHEN THE NEW REGULATIONS WERE INTRODUCED. </p><p>THE NDI REPRESENTATIVE NOTED THAT THE OBSERVERS\' </p><p>SECURITY, ALREADY A CONCERN, IS FURTHER </p><p>ENDANGERED BY THEIR INABILITY TO OBTAIN </p><p>ACCREDITATION.  NDI INFORMED US ON THE EVENING OF </p><p>JUNE 13 THAT IT HAD RAISED THE ACCREDITATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03168  02 OF 03  131651Z </p><p>ISSUE WITH THE ELECTION DIRECTORATE, BUT HAD BEEN </p><p>REFERRED BACK TO THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. </p><p> </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  EMBASSY SEES THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO </p><p>PROCEED WITH THE ACCREDITATION ISSUE, NONE OF </p><p>THEM VERY PROMISING: 1) SUBMIT THE NAMES OF THE </p><p>IRI/NDI OBSERVERS, AS WELL AS THOSE OF EMBASSY </p><p>PERSONNEL ACTING AS OBSERVERS, UNDER COVER OF A </p><p>DIPLOMATIC NOTE, POSSIBLY INCLUDING WORDING </p><p>CLARIFYING THAT THE IRI AND NDI OBSERVERS ARE NOT </p><p>DIRECTLY AFFILIATED WITH THE USG; 2) ATTEMPT TO </p><p>INTERVENE WITH DR. NZUWAH OF THE ELECTION </p><p>DIRECTORATE, AND WITH OTHER APPROPRIATE </p><p>GOVERNMENT INTERLOCUTORS, TO OBTAIN OBSERVER </p><p>STATUS FOR IRI/NDI; OR 3) DETERMINE THAT THERE </p><p>ARE NO REALISTIC MECHANISMS FOR FURTHER </p><p>INTERVENTION BY THE USG ON THE ACCREDITATION </p><p>ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  THE FIRST OPTION POSES A NUMBER OF </p><p>PROBLEMS, IN EMBASSY\'S VIEW.  INCLUDING THE </p><p>IRI/NDI DELEGATIONS IN A LIST OF U.S. OBSERVER </p><p>WOULD PROBABLY GIVE THE GROUP OFFICIAL STATUS IN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6555 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03168  03 OF 03  131651Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-01  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  DODE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------6258B4  131651Z /38 </p><p>O 131655Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6313 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003168 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CORRECTED COPY OF HARARE 3167, RIGHT MARGIN </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR P/DAS POWELL AND DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.

THIS </p><p>WOULD PROBABLY CAUSE THE GOZ TO IDENTIFY THE </p><p>DELEGATIONS\' FINDINGS WITH USG OPINION.  (WE NOTE </p><p>THAT NDI HAS ALREADY STATED PUBLICLY THAT THE </p><p>ELECTIONS CANNOT BE FREE AND FAIR.)  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>IF THE DIPLOMATIC NOTE DID C </p><p>LARIFY THE NON- </p><p>OFFICIAL STATUS OF NDI/IRI, IT IS QUITE LIKELY </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REFUSE TO ACCREDIT THE </p><p>GROUP.  DEPARTMENT MAY BE AWARE OF ADDITIONAL </p><p>COMPLICATIONS THAT WOULD SURROUND THE </p><p>ACCREDITATION OF IRI/NDI AS PART OF AN OFFICIAL </p><p>USG OBSERVER MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  THE SECOND OPTION IS, IN EMBASSY\'S </p><p>ASSESSMENT, LESS PROBLEMATIC.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE </p><p>ELECTION DIRECTORATE\'S NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO NDI, </p><p>AND MORE GENERALLY THE APPARENT LACK OF </p><p>PROCEDURES IN PLACE ON ACCREDITATION OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NGO\'S BY THE DIRECTORATE, IT IS NOT </p><p>AT ALL CLEAR THAT SUCH INTERVENTION WOULD YIELD </p><p>PROMPT AND POSITIVE RESULTS.  INDEED, THE </p><p>ELECTION DIRECTORATE MAY DELAY MAKING A DECISION </p><p>UNTIL IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE IRI </p><p>OBSERVERS TO BE ACCREDITED IN TIME.  THE THIRD </p><p>OPTION MAY BE THE MOST REALISTIC, BUT COULD </p><p>CREATE AN IMPRESSION THAT THE USG DID NOT DO ALL </p><p>IT COULD TO FACILITATE ACCREDITATION FOR IRI/NDI. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03168  03 OF 03  131651Z </p><p> </p><p>11.
