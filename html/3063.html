<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002892 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, JA, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: KING, PM AND FONMIN PITCH A/S BURNS ON DEBT RELIEF </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2725 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb and Foreign </p><p>Minister Marwan Muasher asked A/S Burns and the Ambassador </p><p>June 2 for greater U.S. support for Jordan\'s request for a </p><p>reprofiling of its debt.  Abul Ragheb said that Muasher\'s </p><p>just-concluded meetings in Japan on debt had not gone well, </p><p>with the Japanese arguing that Jordan\'s economic situation </p><p>does not justify this type of treatment.  The Japanese </p><p>told Muasher that they will support a two-year rescheduling </p><p>of pre-cutoff debt and will provide USD 16 million in grant </p><p>assistance and financing for a wastewater treatment plant </p><p>in Zarqa this year, but will not support long-term debt </p><p>rescheduling or reprofiling. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  In the ensuing discussion, the Foreign Minister </p><p>and Prime Minister debated the most effective way to </p><p>clarify and press Jordan\'s argument.  Muasher emphasized </p><p>the "political argument" -- the importance of the </p><p>commitment of U.S. leaders to helping Jordan economically. </p><p>Abul Ragheb stressed instead the economic value of </p><p>reprofiling, saying that Jordan\'s budgetary dependence </p><p>on foreign grant assistance should be taken into account </p><p>and should strengthen the economic rationale for </p><p>reprofiling.  A generous debt relief package would set </p><p>the stage for stronger growth and get Jordan out of the </p><p>trap of having to return to the IMF and Paris Club </p><p>every few years.  Abul Ragheb said King Abdullah would </p><p>be traveling to the UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, and </p><p>Austria in June and would raise debt issues. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  In a later meeting June 2 with A/S Burns and the </p><p>Ambassador, King Abdullah said that all of the social </p><p>liberalization and economic programs he is trying to </p><p>implement risk being trapped under Jordan\'s debt burden. </p><p>He urged the U.S. to work with other Paris Club nations </p><p>for more generous rescheduling terms for Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  A/S Burns responded that the President wants to </p><p>be helpful on this issue.  The U.S. understands Jordan\'s </p><p>needs, but we see no meaningful support for debt </p><p>reprofiling.  Washington is prepared right now to </p><p>support a generous two-year Paris Club rescheduling. </p><p>Although there is a political argument for debt relief, </p><p>Jordan needs also to make a strong economic case and </p><p>should work with the IMF to complete its report on </p><p>Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  The Jordanians are clearly very </p><p>committed to obtaining something more from the Paris Club </p><p>than a two to three year flow rescheduling.  They are </p><p>working with the IMF to develop the economic arguments </p><p>that will supplement Jordan\'s political case for a </p><p>"reprofiling" of its stock of debt (including the large </p><p>post-cutoff date debts mainly owed to Japan).  It plans </p><p>to present these arguments to Paris Club creditors over </p><p>the next month.  Given the interest that we and other </p><p>Paris Club members share in Jordan\'s success in the </p><p>region as a model of good economic policy, we believe </p><p>that it will be important for our partners to hear </p><p>Jordan\'s case and treat it seriously before coming to </p><p>definitive decisions on positions in Paris Club </p><p>negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  A/S Burns has cleared this message. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
