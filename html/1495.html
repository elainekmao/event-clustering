<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 000440 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/25/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: POST-KABILA:  FASHIONING A NEW REGIME </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) WITH THE INITIAL SHOCK OF KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION, AND </p><p>NOW HIS BURIAL, BEHIND THEM, THE CONGOLESE POWER STRUCTURE IS </p><p>STRUGGLING TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THEIR NEW SITUATION AND MOVE </p><p>AHEAD. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) KABILA\'S ADVISERS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>IN THIS CONNECTION, PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA HAS ASSEMBLED AS </p><p>ADVISERS A SMALL GROUP OF MILITARY MEN AROUND HIM, INCLUDING: </p><p>GENERAL KALUME, MINISTER OF PLANNING AND RECONSTRUCTION; FAC </p><p>GENERAL OLENGO; AND COLONEL EDDY KAPEND, AIDE-DE-CAMP UNDER </p><p>LAURENT KABILA.  ON THE CIVILIAN SIDE, HE HAS ALSO BEGUN TO </p><p>ASSEMBLE ABLE TECHNOCRATS SUCH AS LAWYER JEAN MBUYU (WHOM WE </p><p>REGARD HIGHLY AND WHO, WE UNDERSTAND, ALSO WROTE KAKUDJI\'S </p><p>REMARKS AT THE FUNERAL). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) A PROMISING INAUGURAL ADDRESS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THESE ADVISERS -- AND THAT OF SOME OF </p><p>THE LEADERS HERE FOR THE FUNERAL, SUCH AS BELGIAN DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER LOUIS MICHEL -- JOSEPH KABILA IS PRESENTLY </p><p>PREPARING HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, WHICH HE EXPECTS TO DELIVER </p><p>BEFORE THE WEEKEND.  ONE OF OUR SOURCES, WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE </p><p>SEEN AN INITIAL DRAFT OF KABILA\'S REMARKS, TOLD US THAT HE IS </p><p>IMPRESSED.  EMPHASIS WILL BE ON OPENING UP THE PROCESS, BOTH </p><p>WITH REGARD TO THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, LIBERALIZING DECREE 194 </p><p>WHICH IMPOSES HEAVY LIMITS ON POLITICAL PARTY ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>AND ACTIVITIES; AND STRENGTHENING THE GOVERNMENT\'S HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS RECORD.  THE INAUGURAL ADDRESS WILL ALSO MAKE AN </p><p>URGENT APPEAL FOR A REVIVAL OF THE PEACE EFFORT BASED ON </p><p>LUSAKA, AT LEAST AS A REFERENCE POINT, AND MAKE A </p><p>CONCILIATORY GESTURE, UNDEFINED, TOWARD NATIONAL DIALOGUE </p><p>FACILITATOR MASIRE.  WE UNDERSTAND, FURTHER, THAT THE </p><p>POSTPONEMENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION FROM JANUARY 24 </p><p>TO JANUARY 25 OR 26 WAS DUE TO LAST DITCH EFFORTS BY </p><p>HARD-LINERS, NOTABLY JUSTICE MINISTER MWENZE KONGOLO AND </p><p>OTHERS, TO WATER DOWN KABILA\'S CONSTRUCTIVE, FORWARD-LOOKING </p><p>MESSAGE (RATHER THAN TECHNICAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL REASONS). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>4. (C) WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>THE MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IN MOVING AHEAD IS THAT OF THE </p><p>NATURE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE KABILA IS TO ASSUME, AND </p><p>THREE MODELS ARE BEING DISCUSSED: </p><p> </p><p>-- BE SWORN IN NOW AS A "FULL" PRESIDENT WITH AN OPEN-ENDED </p><p>TERM AND DEAL WITH OTHER ISSUES OR PROBLEMS THIS MAY POSE </p><p>LATER; </p><p> </p><p>-- AGREE TO BE A TRANSITIONAL "INTERIM" PRESIDENT; OR, </p><p> </p><p>-- BECOME A "FULL" PRESIDENT WITH A STRICTLY LIMITED TERM OF </p><p>OFFICE, THAT IS, ELECTIONS TO BE HELD WITHIN TWO YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA AND HIS ADVISERS APPARENTLY PREFER THE LAST </p><p>OPTION, AND WE AND MOST OTHER DIPLOMATS HERE CONSIDER IT THE </p><p>LEAST PROBLEMATICAL AND MOST LIKELY TO PROMOTE RECONCILIATION </p><p>AND STABILITY IN THE INTERIM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) THE QUESTION OF LEGITIMACY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>BELGIAN AMBASSADOR NIJSKENS TOLD AMBASSADOR SWING EVENING OF </p><p>JANUARY 24 THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD RESEARCHED THE QUESTION OF </p><p>SUCCESSION AND HAD CONCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-- DECREE NUMBER THREE OF MAY 1997 (ISSUED JUST DAYS AFTER </p><p>KABILA TOOK POWER) IS SILENT ON THE QUESTION OF PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>SUCCESSION. </p><p> </p><p>-- HOWEVER, THE DECREE DOES PROVIDE THAT, ANY ISSUE WHICH </p><p>DECREE 3 DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS IS TO BE COVERED BY </p><p>THE "TRANSITIONAL ACT"; AND, </p><p> </p><p>-- ARTICLE 54 OF THE "ACTE DE TRANSITION" PROVIDES THAT WHEN </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT DETERMINES THAT THE PRESIDENCY IS "VACANT", </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT AND SUPREME COURT DECIDE IN WHOM THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS OF THE PRESIDENCY ARE TO BE INVESTED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED THE BELGIAN POSITION </p><p>WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF LEGITIMACY AND THE MANNER IN </p><p>WHICH THE GDRC IS PROCEEDING TO INAUGURATE JOSEPH KABILA AS </p><p>FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA HAS CREATED </p><p>A SITUATION OF URGENCY IN THE CONGO WHICH REQUIRES CONTINUITY </p><p>AND SECURITY; </p><p> </p><p>-- GIVEN THAT THE ISSUE OF LEGITIMACY IS POSED, HOWEVER, A </p><p>POLICY OF POLITICAL OPENNESS IS CRITICAL; </p><p> </p><p>-- IN THIS REGARD, EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON BEGINNING </p><p>THIS POLICY OF OPENNESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL (WHILE POLITICIANS </p><p>ARE ENGAGING IN THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, THERE SHOULD BE </p><p>SIMULTANEOUS EFFORTS TO BEGIN ORGANIZING LOCAL ELECTIONS); </p><p>AND, </p><p> </p><p>-- FINALLY, THE SEARCH FOR PEACE SHOULD BE PERMANENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE CHALLENGE WITH WHICH THE CONGOLESE ARE GRAPPLING IS THAT </p><p>OF HOW TO PRESERVE THE LEGACY OF LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA WHILE, </p><p>SIMULTANEOUSLY, INSTITUTING THE COURSE CORRECTIONS REQUIRED </p><p>TO PROPEL THE COUNTRY FORWARD TOWARD PEACE AND STABILITY AND </p><p>POLITICAL OPENNESS.  JOSEPH KABILA IS CRITICAL TO MEETING </p><p>THIS CHALLENGE SUCCESSFULLY.  THIS IS THE CASE BOTH BECAUSE </p><p>OF HIS NAME, AS WELL AS HIS POSITION IN THE MILITARY, AND HIS </p><p>OWN APPARENT DESIRE TO MOVE BEYOND THE CURRENT IMPASSE FACING </p><p>THE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
