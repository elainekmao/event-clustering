<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 FRANKFURT 000401 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, GM </p><p>SUBJECT:  FDP CHIEF WESTERWELLE FAILS TO LEAD PARTY OUT OF </p><p>CRISIS AT NATIONAL MEETING IN STUTTGART </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The Free Democratic Party\'s (FDP) </p><p>traditional Three Kings gathering in Stuttgart (January 5-6) </p><p>is one of the first major national political conventions in </p><p>the new year and generates a lot of media interest. </p><p>National Party Chief Guido Westerwelle was under pressure to </p><p>deliver a speech guiding his party out of its current </p><p>crisis.  Although he satisfied many delegates by presenting </p><p>a clear list of policy themes, including a return to free </p><p>market economic ideas, social welfare reform, and better </p><p>education, Westerwelle disappointed many with an overly- </p><p>idealistic view that the FDP should try to be a large "party </p><p>of the people" like the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) or </p><p>the Social Democratic Party (SPD).  FDP floor leader </p><p>Wolfgang Gerhardt, generally thought of as a foreign policy </p><p>expert, actually received the strongest response, </p><p>occasioning speculation that he could potentially replace </p><p>Westerwelle (though Gerhardt has repeatedly stated that he </p><p>is not interested in being party chief).  Gerhardt blasted </p><p>the SPD-Green government\'s incompetence in economic and </p><p>foreign affairs, and stressed the relevance of FDP expertise </p><p>in these areas.  Gerhardt also made several pro-U.S. </p><p>statements.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Westerwelle Outlines Five Themes, But Disappoints </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Expectations were high on January 6 in Stuttgart. </p><p>Over a thousand guests and party members at the Stuttgart </p><p>opera house wanted to hear FDP National Party Chief Guido </p><p>Westerwelle provide policy direction to lead the party out </p><p>of its current doldrums.  The FDP party\'s traditional Three </p><p>Kings gathering in Stuttgart (January 5-6) is one of the </p><p>first major national political conventions in the new year </p><p>and generates a lot of media interest.  The FDP has been </p><p>hurt in recent months by a scandal related to North Rhine </p><p>Wesphalia (NRW) party leader Juergen Moellemann\'s anti- </p><p>Semitic flyer shortly before the September 2002 national </p><p>elections.  A controversy over the brochure\'s financing, and </p><p>Moellemann\'s quarrels with the Central Council of German </p><p>Jews damaged the FDP\'s reputation.  A campaign initiated by </p><p>Westerwelle and Moellemann, seen by many as based more on </p><p>public relations antics than substance, irritated the </p><p>party\'s traditional supporters particularly in the business </p><p>sector. "Project 18," the failed campaign to get 18 percent </p><p>of the national vote in September 2002 elections also cost </p><p>the party credibility.  The FDP managed a mere 1.4 percent </p><p>gain in the 2002 national elections over its dismal 1998 </p><p>results. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In his one-hour address, Westerwelle missed a </p><p>chance to reinvigorate the party.  Without mentioning </p><p>"Project 18," he spent much time defending the FDP as an </p><p>alternative to the SPD and CDU.  Westerwelle said the FDP </p><p>needed to become a party for all people since liberal ideas </p><p>are "good for Germany."  The FDP should be more broadly </p><p>based as a party of the people and be at "eye-level" with </p><p>the CDU and SPD.  Other party leaders and supporters have </p><p>told us that they view this as unrealistic, and that it was </p><p>thus deeply disappointing for many. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Westerwelle described five core FDP policy themes: </p><p>a renewal of free market economics; a reform of Germany\'s </p><p>social welfare system -- with the recognition that things </p><p>could become uncomfortable for awhile; a strengthening of </p><p>education, including research and development; continuity </p><p>and dependability in foreign affairs; and a healthy debate </p><p>on traditional values in Germany (i.e. that traditional </p><p>values are not old-fashioned, but relevant and essential </p><p>today).  Westerwelle\'s speech failed, however, to address </p><p>the FDP\'s lack of clear policy goals, something that has </p><p>upset the party\'s traditional support base.  He seemed to be </p><p>focusing on the ideal, rather than managing the party\'s </p><p>current difficulties. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On economic issues, Westerwelle called for tax </p><p>reductions to stimulate growth and a withdrawal of state </p><p>involvement in the private sector.  He criticized the </p><p>national government\'s holding of shares in over 400 private </p><p>enterprises.  Westerwelle also demanded more flexibility in </p><p>the labor market, restructuring of the social welfare </p><p>system, and a more flexible tariff system.  He also stated </p><p>the party should point out the positive impacts of </p><p>globalization.  On state support, Westerwelle emphasized </p><p>that whoever receives financial or educational support from </p><p>the state should have to make a contribution back to the </p><p>state, but did not outline specifics.  Westerwelle also </p><p>suggested the reintroduction of demographic factors in the </p><p>pension and healthcare systems to more accurately assess the </p><p>impact of an aging population with fewer younger workers to </p><p>support it. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On foreign policy, Westerwelle stressed the need to </p><p>act as a reliable alliance partner.  He chastised Schroeder </p><p>for using the misleading phrase "German way."  Germany\'s </p><p>foreign policy must be compatible with European foreign </p><p>policy.  He also stated that there is not "too much America </p><p>in international politics but rather not enough Europe." </p><p>Westerwelle received polite applause for his one-hour </p><p>address. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>The Resurrection of Wolfgang Gerhardt </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The best speech of the day was delivered by FDP </p><p>Bundestag floor leader Wolfgang Gerhardt, who received a </p><p>standing ovation.  In a rousing address, Gerhardt asserted </p><p>the liberal principles the FDP should stand for.  The over- </p><p>burdened social welfare systems must be cut back: they are </p><p>the biggest obstacles to creating new jobs.  He demanded </p><p>more individual responsibility, a renewal of free market </p><p>economics, improvements in education, a reshaping of </p><p>Germany\'s social systems, fair competition and international </p><p>cooperation in foreign policy matters.  He pointed out that </p><p>he agrees with Westerwelle that the FDP has to increase its </p><p>membership, but without compromising the party\'s character </p><p>or traditional principles. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Gerhardt sharply attacked the SPD-Green national </p><p>government for allegedly hiding the extent of the country\'s </p><p>budget deficits before the election.  He predicted that the </p><p>next national budget is already out of balance since it is </p><p>based on faulty economic predictions.  In reference to the </p><p>upcoming state elections in Hesse and Lower Saxony, Gerhardt </p><p>called out to the audience "Vote yourself free on February </p><p>2!"  He described Schroeder as the most unprincipled </p><p>Chancellor since the beginning of the Federal Republic. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Gerhardt also delivered several strong pro-U.S. </p><p>statements.  He reminded the audience of the "Speech of </p><p>Hope," delivered by U.S. State Secretary James F. Byrnes on </p><p>September 6, 1946 at the Stuttgart opera house which </p><p>encouraged German citizens after the devastation of war. </p><p>Gerhardt said that gratitude has to remain an aspect of </p><p>foreign policy.  He chastised Schroeder and Foreign Minister </p><p>Fischer for using anti-American rhetoric in their election </p><p>campaign and damaging Germany\'s reputation abroad. </p><p>"American soldiers died to save us from the Nazis, and we </p><p>must never forget that," he said, "A former U.S. President, </p><p>the first President Bush, supported our reunification when </p><p>we needed help."  Concerning Iraq, Gerhardt noted that his </p><p>party would support an intervention without a UN mandate but </p><p>that differences of opinion with the U.S. could be managed </p><p>in a friendlier atmosphere. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>A Bad Day for Doering </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Along with Westerwelle, another leading FDP </p><p>politician had a bad day.  On January 5, at the traditional </p><p>Baden-Wuerttemberg (B-W) state party convention preceding </p><p>the annual Three Kings Gathering, B-W State Chair and </p><p>Economic Minister Walter Doering got a black eye from his </p><p>rank and file in his bid to remain State Chair, receiving </p><p>nearly 20 percent less support than in 2001.  Although he </p><p>was reelected for another two years to lead the B-W FDP, </p><p>Doering received only 77 percent of the votes and was </p><p>visibly disappointed.  Contacts told us that many delegates </p><p>are still upset over the B-W government coalition agreement </p><p>reached with the CDU in which FDP issues are almost non- </p><p>existent. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Comment: The 2003 Three Kings Meeting in Stuttgart </p><p>was not the much awaited turning point for the FDP. </p><p>Westerwelle could not - or did not want - to deliver a </p><p>speech that would carve out big themes for the future. </p><p>Instead, he seemed determined to continue with the strategy </p><p>of turning the FDP into a "people\'s party" with a larger </p><p>base like the CDU or SPD.  "It is not the objective of the </p><p>FDP to support one of the other two big parties."  In the </p><p>wake of the failed "18 percent" campaign, this seems to many </p><p>supporters overly optimistic.  However, with two important </p><p>state elections (Hesse and Lower Saxony) on February 2, the </p><p>assembled leadership of the FDP could do little else than </p><p>demonstrate solidarity with Westerwelle. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Comment - Continued:  How long this solidarity </p><p>will last will depend on the outcome of the February 2 state </p><p>elections.  With his fiery and well-received speech in </p><p>Stuttgart, Gerhardt has revived speculation that he may be </p><p>an alternative to Westerwelle.  It was also noteworthy that </p><p>several of the speakers mentioned the importance of the </p><p>German-U.S. relationship and the need to improve </p><p>transatlantic relations in the wake of Schroeder\'s damaging </p><p>comments during the campaign last year.  End Comment </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) This message has been coordinated with Embassy </p><p>Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
