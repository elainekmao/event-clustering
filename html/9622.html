The Ambassador </p><p>U.S. Embassy </p><p>Kuwait </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Jones </p><p> </p><p>As you may know, Kuwait Airways Corporation "KAC" which is </p><p>solely owned by the Government of the State of Kuwait, lost </p><p>most of its stock of Aircraft spare parts, engines, and </p><p>equipments as a result of the unlawful take over and </p><p>conversion acts by Iraqi Airways Company "IAC", during the </p><p>invasion of the State of Kuwait in 1990-91. </p><p> </p><p>As it is worth mentioning that, after the liberation of </p><p>Kuwait, IAC returned some of these spares through the United </p><p>Nation\'s Sanctions Commission, the fact remains that the </p><p>major part of KAC spares was never retrieved.  The Government </p><p>of Kuwait was informed lately by KAC Management that truthful </p><p>sources indicated that part of the KAC lost spares are laid </p><p>in Baghdad International Airport and specifically in IAC </p><p>bonded spares stores and that other considerable quantities </p><p>of expensive spares were loaded by direct orders of high IAC </p><p>officials in 6 containers and dispersed in two locations in </p><p>Baghdad suburban area, so to be kept away from the U.S. </p><p>Forces. </p><p> </p><p>To the effect, the Government of the State of Kuwait would </p><p>highly appreciate your kind assistance in taking the </p><p>appropriate measures to advise the U.S. Civil Authorities in </p><p>Iraq to enable KAC recuperating its lost spares that are </p><p>located in Baghdad Intl. Airport (IAC Stores) and in other </p><p>locations in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>The Government of the State of Kuwait will arrange, upon your </p><p>prompt and positive reply, for a KAC Technical Team to reach </p><p>Baghdad and liaise with the U.S. Forces in a joint team, in </p><p>order to locate, identify and transport -as soon as possible- </p><p>to Kuwait, all spares that are identified and proven to be </p><p>KAC property according to the KAC List of Lost Spares that </p><p>will be presented as evidence on their undisputed property </p><p>ship. </p><p> </p><p>END text. </p><p> </p><p>6.
