<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 012144 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, NEA/IAI, AND SMEC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/26/09 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PTER, KPAL, KWBG, PREL, PHUM, GZ, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: HAMAS DEBATES FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEL AVIV 10899 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) OUR CONTACTS IN GAZA HAVE PRESENTED DIFFERING </p><p>VIEWS OVER NEXT STEPS BEING CONTEMPLATED BY HAMAS.  A </p><p>SENIOR FATAH LEADER AND MEMBER OF THE FATAH CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE, HANI AL-HASSAN, TOLD US RECENTLY THAT HAMAS </p><p>WAS PLANNING AN "ELECTION" FOR MEMBERS OF ITS POLITBURO </p><p>AND CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY.  AL-HASSAN SAID HE WAS </p><p>SEEKING TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, WHICH, </p><p>HE SAID, WOULD PIT OUTSIDERS AGAINST INSIDERS.  AL- </p><p>HASSAN SAID HE FEARD THAT HAMAS COULD SPLIT FOLLOWING </p><p>THE ELECTION, LEAVING THE MORE RADICAL ELEMENT OF HAMAS </p><p>IN UNCERTAIN HANDS.  BY CONTRAST, ISLAMIST WEEKLY "AL- </p><p>RISALLAH" EDITOR GHAZI HAMAD, TOLD US THAT WHILE HAMAS </p><p>IS INDEED DEBATING ITS FUTURE, NO ELECTION WILL BE </p><p>HELD IN THE NEAR TERM.  HAMAD SAID HAMAS FACED INTERNAL </p><p>DIFFICULTIES AND SAID THAT YASIN WAS FACING A "HEAVY </p><p>BURDEN" TO ATTEMPTING TO MANTAIN UNITY AND INFLUENCE </p><p>HIS ORGANIZATION\'S FUTURE COURSE.  BOTH HAMAD AND AL- </p><p>HASSAN SAID THEY DID NOT FORESEE "MILITARY OPERATIONS" </p><p>IN THE NEAR TERM, ALTHOUGH THEY OFFERED DIFFERENT </p><p>REASONS FOR THEIR VIEWS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>AL-HASSAN: GET READY FOR SEPTEMBER 19 </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) EMBASSY CONTACTS IN GAZA HAVE PROVIDED DIFFERING </p><p>VIEWS OF HAMAS\' NEAR-TERM STRATEGY.  HANI AL-HASSAN, A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE FATAH CENTRAL COMMITTEE WHO HAS MAINTAINED </p><p>CLOSE LINKS TO PALESTINIAN ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS THROUGH </p><p>HIS FORMER MEMBERSHIP IN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN TO US THAT HAMAS FACED A SPLIT IN </p><p>THEIR ORGANIZATION.  AL-HASSAN SAID HAMAS WAS PLANNING </p><p>TO HOLD AN ELECTION ON SEPTEMBER 19 FOR ITS POLITBURO </p><p>AND MAJLIS SHURA (CONSULATIVE ASSEMBLY). (COMMENT: OTHER </p><p>AGENCY REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE SEPTEMBER 19TH DATE HAS </p><p>ALREADY SLIPPED, PERHAPS AS FAR BACK AS DECEMBER.  DELAY </p><p>UNTIL DECEMBER MAY PLACE THE ELECTIONS NEAR </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2ND PHASE OF WYE, POSSIBLY NOT A </p><p>PROPITIOUS TIME FOR AN ELECTION FROM HAMAS\' POINT OF </p><p>VIEW IF THINGS ARE GOING WELL IN THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>PLACE OF THE ELECTION IS NOT KNOWN.  END COMMENT.)  THE </p><p>ELECTION WOULD PIT KHALID MISH\'AL AGAINST ABU MARZOUK </p><p>FOR THE HEAD OF THE POLITBURO.  AL-HASSAN SAID HE WAS </p><p>WORKING UNDER ARAFAT\'S ORDERS TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME </p><p>OF THE ELECTION AND TO PREVENT A SPLIT IN HAMAS THAT </p><p>COULD LEAVE THE RADICALS WITHOUT THE MORE "MODERATE" </p><p>POLITICAL CONTROL OF SHEIKH YASIN.  "IRAN WILL GAN THE </p><p>UPPER HAND," AL-HASSAN SAID IF THERE IS A SPLIT IN THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  (COMMENT:  AL-HASSAN\'S COMMENTS RUN </p><p>COUNTER TO THE POLICY TH PA HAS BEEN TELLING US THEY </p><p>ARE FOLLOWING TOWARD HAMAS, I.E., O SPLIT OFF THE </p><p>MODERATES, ISOLATE THE RADICALS AND MOVE AGAINST THEM. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>MISH\'AL LEADS THE CHARGE AGAINST YASIN </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO AL-HASSAN, THE KEY DYNAMIC INSIDE </p><p>HAMAS WAS AN EFFORT BY KHALID MISH\'AL TO SEIZE CONTROL </p><p>OF THE PARTY FROM YASIN.  AT THE ELECTION, YASIN WILL </p><p>TRY TO PUSH FORWARD A CHANGE TO HAMAS\' OPERATING </p><p>PROCEDURES THAT WOULD REQUIRE EXPLICIT BLESSINGS OF THE </p><p>INSIDE LEADERSHIP BEFORE CONDUCTING "OPERATIONS." </p><p>(COMMENT: WE DO NOT SEE THE LOGIC OF SUCH A MOVE.  WHILE </p><p>ON ITS FACE, IT MIGHT GIVE YASIN GREATER SPECIFIC </p><p>AUTHORITY TO CONTROL "OPERATIONS," THERE IS A CLEAR </p><p>DOWNSIDE. IF KNOWN, IT WOULD EXPLICITLY TIE THE INSIDE </p><p>LEADERSHIP TO ANY FUTURE TERRORIST OPERATION AND LEAD TO </p><p>AN EVEN HEAVIER CRACKDOWN AGAINST HAMAS OPERATIVES IN </p><p>AREAS UNDER PA CONTROL.)  AL-HASSAN SAID THAT THE </p><p>MISH\'AL FACTION CURRENTLY ENJOYS A TWO-PERSON ADVANTAGE </p><p>IN THE POLITBURO.  YASIN WAS CONTEMPLAING SENDING </p><p>MAHMOUD ZAHHAR AND POSSIBLY ISMAIL ABU SHANAB TO </p><p>INFLUENCE HAMAS MEMBERS IN THE GULF AND ELSEWHERE TO </p><p>SUPPORT YASIN IN THE ELECTION.  (COMMENT: PERHAPS THE </p><p>USG FACES A TERMINOLOGICAL PROBLEM IN REFERRING TO </p><p>"INSIDERS" AND "OUTSIDERS."  WE TEND TO THINK OF </p><p>OUTSIDERS AS BEING MORE HARDLINE AND CLOSER TO THE </p><p>MISH\'AL POSITION.  IN FACT, IF WHAT AL-HASSAN SAYS IS </p><p>TRUE, YASIN BELIEVES HE CAN INFLUENCE THE OSTENSIBLY </p><p>"OUTSIDER" VOTE TO SUPPORT HIS MORE "MODERATE" </p><p>POSITION.) </p><p> </p><p>AL-HASSAN ON WHO\'S HOT AND WHO\'S NOT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SPEAKING ABOUT VARIOUS HAMAS PERSONALITIES, AL- </p><p>HASSAN SAID THAT MAHMOUD ZAHHAR IS CLOSELY TRUSTED BY </p><p>YASIN.  IN THE WEST BANK, YASIN RELIES ON JAMAL MANSOUR </p><p>FROM NABLUS.  AL-HASSAN SAID THAT FUGITIVE MOHAMMED DEIF </p><p>WAS STILL AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF HAMAS, BUT FOLLOWED </p><p>ORDERS FROM YASIN WHO, ACCORDING TO AL-HASSAN, IS </p><p>AGAINST "OPERATIONS" AT THIS TIME.  DIF IS VERY </p><p>INTELLIGENT AND AL-HASSAN SAID HE WAS CONTINUALLY </p><p>CUTTING OFF CONTACT WITH THOSE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO LEAD </p><p>THE PA TO HIM.  AL-HASSAN ALSO SAID THAT SAID BAREKAT, </p><p>FORMERLY OF THE PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ), IS </p><p>INCREASINGLY INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE PEACE POCESS AND IS </p><p>NOW ACTIVE IN A GROUP FOUNDED BY AL-HASSAN THAT HAS MET </p><p>WITH ISRAELIS IN THE PAST.  AMONG OTHER PIJ MEMBERS, AL- </p><p>HASSAN CHARACTERIZED SHELLAH AS "NOT A REAL FIGHTER" AND </p><p>SAID THAT RAMADAN "COULD BE EASILY BOUGHT OFF." </p><p> </p><p>HAMAD: NO ELECTIONS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ALTHOUGH HAMAD AGREED THAT HAMAS IS FACING SOME </p><p>DIFFICULT DECISIONS, HE SAID THERE WERE NO PLANS TO HOLD </p><p>ELECTIONS.  UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, HAMAD SAID, AN </p><p>ELECTION WOULD MERELY FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE DIVISIONS </p><p>WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND WAS THEREFORE UNWISE.  HAMAS </p><p>IS FACING THE SAME ISSUES IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERING FOR </p><p>THE PAST YEAR.  CHIEF AMONG THEM IS HAMAS\' RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH THE PA AND THE DEBATE OVER HOLDING "MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS."  YASIN IS TRYING TO REPAIR THE BREACHES IN </p><p>THE WALLS OF HAMAS UNITY AND FEELS INCREASINGLY THAT HE </p><p>IS UNDER A HEAVY BURDEN.  YASIN, WHILE NOT RENOUNCING </p><p>TERROR ATTACKS, WANTS TO MOVE HAMAS INTO A MORE PURELY </p><p>POLITICAL DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS\' LONG-TERM STRATEGY </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) HAMAD SAID THAT PERSONALLY HE DID NOT FORESEE </p><p>RENEWED TERRORIST ATTACKS, DESPITE CONTINUED CLAIMS OF </p><p>HAMAS\' ALLEGIANCE TO "ARMED STRUGGLE."  HAMAD ADDED THAT </p><p>IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HAMAS "TO REMAIN QUIET" IN THE FACE </p><p>OF ARRESTS AND CONTINUED DETENTION OF THEIR MEMBERS. </p><p>BUT IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, HAMAS UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>CRACKDOWNS THAT WOULD FOLLOW ANY ATTACKS WERE A HIGH </p><p>PRICE TO PAY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) POLITICALLY, HAMAD DISCOUNTED THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>A SPLIT WITHIN HAMAS.  AS HAMAD HAS SAID IN THE PAST, </p><p>HAMAS DIFFERS INTERNALLY ON THE QUESTION OF TACTICS, BUT </p><p>REMAINED COMMITTED TO THE "IDEA OF HAMAS" (I.E., </p><p>OPPOSITION TO OSLO AND TO ANY COMPROMISE ITH ISRAEL). </p><p>HAMAD SAID THAT THE BASIC HAMAS STRATEGY WAS TO WAIT FOR </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS TO FAIL.  AT THAT POINT, IT WOULD NOT </p><p>BE AN ISSUE OF HAMAS TAKING UP ARMED STRUGGLE ALONE, ALL </p><p>PALESTINIANS WOULD TAKE UP ARMED STRUGGLE AND HAMAS </p><p>WOULD BE THE BEST POSITIONED TO LEAD IT. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAD ON HAMAS PERSONALITIES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) HAMAD ALSO COMMENTED ON SOME HAMAS </p><p>PERSONALITIES.  ON DEIF, HAMAD SAID THAT HE REMAINED </p><p>"BELOVED" AMONG PALESTINIANS BECAUSE OF THE TOLL HE </p><p>EXACTED FROM ISRAEL.  BUT HE CHARACTERIZED DEIF AS BEING </p><p>"OUT OF THE PICTURE" FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.  HAMAD ALSO </p><p>SAID THAT RANTISSI, DESPITE HIS RE-ARREST, REMAINED VERY </p><p>STRONG AND THAT TIME IN JAIL WOULD NOT DIMINISH HS </p><p>STRENGTH. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ISRAELIS ARE WORRIED THAT THE RECENT UPSWING IN </p><p>SMALL-SCALE OERATIONS PORTENDS A MUCH LARGER WAVE OF </p><p>ATTACKS TO COME.  ACCORDING TO OUR INTERLOCUTORS IN </p><p>GAZA, SUCH IS NOT THE CASE.  RATHER THEY POINT TO THE </p><p>RE-ARREST OF RANTISSI, THE BRIEF INARCERATION OF ISMAIL </p><p>ABU SHANAB, AND EVEN 12 HOURS HAMAD HIMSELF SPENT </p><p>ENJOYING JIBALI\'S HOSPITALITY AS EVIDENCES OF A PA </p><p>CRACKDOWN.  (HAMAD WAS DETAINED AFTER HE QUOTED NEW PA </p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL ZOUHAIR SOURANI CRITICIZING THE STATE </p><p>SECURITY COURTS.)  ALSO, PA OFFICIALS ARE QUTED IN THE </p><p>ISRAELI MEDIA AS SAYING THEY HAVE DETAINED 90 HAMAS </p><p>ACTIVISTS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IN RESPONSE TO HAMAS </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO ATTACK ISRAELIS.  ON TE QUESTION OF </p><p>ELECTIONS, WE TEND TO CREDIT HAMAD.  HAMAS LEADERSHIP </p><p>WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY TRY TO WORK OUT DIFFERENCES </p><p>PRIVATELY RATHER THAN ALLOW DIFFERENCES TO AIR IN ANY </p><p>SORT OF SEMI-PUBLIC MANNER.  IF AND WHEN YASIN MANAGES </p><p>TO SORT OUT THESE DIFFERENCES, AN ELECTION MIGHT SERVE </p><p>HIS INTERESTS BY DEMONSTRATING HIS CONTINUING CONTROL </p><p>OVER THE ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>SCHWARTZ </p><p></p></div>
