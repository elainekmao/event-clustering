<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000990 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ASEC, CASC, ECON, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: OIL COMPANY SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Ambassador Jeter, Consul General </p><p>and CG Lagos staff met EXXON/MOBIL, Halliburton and </p><p>ChevronTexaco Managing Directors on May 27 to </p><p>encourage more timely notification of the Mission in </p><p>the event of hostage-takings, occupation of </p><p>facilities, or interruption of oil company operations. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) During a meeting hosted at Embassy request by </p><p>the ChevronTexaco Managing Director Jay Pryor, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter expressed concern about the lack of </p><p>timely Embassy notification of security crises in </p><p>which American citizens and oil production facilities </p><p>are involved.  Most recently, the Transocean rig </p><p>takeover in April 2003 was not reported to Post until </p><p>almost one week after the crisis began.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter told the representatives that the Mission could </p><p>be helpful in resolving future crises just as it was </p><p>helpful in enlisting National Labour Congress </p><p>President Adams Oshiomole to end the Transocean </p><p>platform occupations and hostage-takings.  He noted </p><p>that the Embassy could also engage the Government of </p><p>Nigeria (GON) at the highest levels including the </p><p>President, National Security Advisor, State Security </p><p>Service and others, as it did during the Transocean </p><p>crisis.  In that instance, Embassy intervention may </p><p>have preempted plans to use military force that might </p><p>have proved dangerous for the hostages.  Post also </p><p>kept Washington and other official players well </p><p>informed with up-to-the-minute analysis of the </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Company representatives expressed reluctance </p><p>to share immediate information with Post, fearing that </p><p>the Freedom of Information Act (FIA) requirements </p><p>might require the release of the information to </p><p>others, including the media. They pointed out that the </p><p>immediate aftermath of an incident was a critical </p><p>negotiating period when publicity could prove harmful. </p><p>Unless serious injury is imminent, companies prefer to </p><p>negotiate without Embassy intervention unless </p><p>intervention could be discreet.  The companies would </p><p>be willing to be more forthcoming with information if </p><p>given assurances that the USG would not release </p><p>information into the public domain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Despite their reservations about </p><p>confidentiality, the companies want to maintain </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>frequent contact with the Mission on security matters. </p><p>All agreed that meetings to discuss security issues at </p><p>the level of the Ambassador and Managing Directors </p><p>should be held every two months.  In addition, there </p><p>are regularly scheduled OSAC meetings for company </p><p>security directors, which are fully endorsed and </p><p>supported by company Managing Directors.  The next </p><p>such meeting is scheduled for June 10.  Finally, </p><p>company representatives were encouraged to engage the </p><p>re-elected Obasanjo Administration on problems in the </p><p>Niger Delta, particularly on security and the </p><p>breakdown of law and order, which have accelerated in </p><p>recent months.  The three companies agreed that due to </p><p>this increase in crime, conducting business in safety </p><p>and security has become more precarious and difficult. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Embassy will be looking at ways in which </p><p>oil and oil service companies and the Mission can </p><p>exchange information in real time.  It was agreed that </p><p>information received in a timely manner is the only </p><p>way to maintain the appropriate level of security. It </p><p>also was agreed that future meetings should be </p><p>expanded to include other major oil producers, such as </p><p>Shell and Agip.  Future meetings will focus on </p><p>modalities for improving security for the oil </p><p>community, Nigeria\'s law enforcement capabilities to </p><p>combat rising crime levels, development of a Code of </p><p>Conduct for local oil company employees, and the role </p><p>of the Embassy\'s Corporate Responsibility Officer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT: The Managing Directors were very </p><p>grateful for this meeting.  Noting that this was the </p><p>first time that the Embassy had taken such an </p><p>initiative to systematically explore ways of improving </p><p>oil company security.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
