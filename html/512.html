BELOW IS THE LETTER ADDRESSED TO PRESIDENT BUSH. </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00558  01 OF 02  141320Z </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH </p><p>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA </p><p> </p><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: </p><p> </p><p>THE NUMBER OF CEASE-FIRE VIOLATIONS AND ESCALATING </p><p>ATTACKS ON CROATIAN CITIES AND VILLAGES, AS WELL AS </p><p>EXPULSIONS OF REMAINING CROATIAN AND NON-SERBIAN </p><p>POPULATIONS FROM THE OCCUPIED AREAS OF THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>CROATIA, IS ASSUMING ALARMING PROPORTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, OUR FEARS ABOUT THE WAR SPREADING TO </p><p>NEIGHBOURING BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA HAVE BEEN REALIZED. </p><p>THERE, THE SAME SCENARIO AND THE SAME TERRITORIAL </p><p>PRETENSIONS ARE BEING INFLICTED UPON THE CROATIAN AND </p><p>MOSLEM POPULATIONS.  HORRIBLE CRIMES ARE BEING </p><p>UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PERPETRATED AGAINST THEM AND THEY ARE BEING EXPELLED </p><p>FROM THEIR HOMES IN ORDER TO ETHNICALLY "PURIFY" THE </p><p>TERRITORY FOR A GREATER SERBIA.  THESE ACTIONS </p><p>ENDANGER THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>PEACE-KEEPING FORCES, THE PEACE CONFERENCE ON </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA, AND STABILITY IN THIS PART OF EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>THE ALREADY-EXISTING 600,000 REFUGEES IN CROATIA HAVE </p><p>BEEN JOINED IN THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS BY 65,000 MORE </p><p>FROM BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, AND THE NUMBERS ARE </p><p>INCREASING DAILY.  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>CROATIA IS DOING ALL POSSIBLE TO ASSIST THOSE AFFECTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00558  01 OF 02  141320Z </p><p>BY THIS SENSELESS WAR, BUT DUE TO THE DESTRUCTION </p><p>WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED AND THE NUMBER OF </p><p>REFUGEES WITHIN CROATIA, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO </p><p>RESOLVE THE HUMANITARIAN PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE </p><p>ESCALATION OF THE CONFLICT IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA </p><p>WITHOUT YOUR AID. </p><p> </p><p>WE APPEAL TO YOU TO USE YOUR PERSONAL INFLUENCE AND </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION YOUR COUNTRY ENJOYS TO </p><p>ACTIVATE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO UNDERTAKE </p><p>ENERGETIC MEASURES AGAINST SERBIA, MONTENEGRO AND THE </p><p>YUGOSLAV NATIONAL ARMY, IN ORDER TO BRING TO A </p><p>PERMANENT END THE AGGRESSION AND DEATH OF INNOCENT </p><p>PEOPLE.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MECHANISM FOR HALTING THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATES OF CROATIA AND </p><p>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA BE APPLIED. </p><p> </p><p>MORE CONCRETELY, IT IS NECESSARY TO SPEED UP THE </p><p>DEPLOYMENT DATE ENVISIONED FOR THE PEACEKEEPING TROOPS </p><p>AND THE RETREAT OF THE YUGOSLAV NATIONAL ARMY FROM THE </p><p>ENTIRE TERRITORY OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA;  TO LIFT </p><p>ALL AIR, SEA AND LAND BLOCKADES;  AND TO GUARANTEE THE </p><p>RETURN OF ALL REFUGEES.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONSIDER A PEACE-KEEPING PLAN AND </p><p>OPERATION IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA.  IT IS ALSO </p><p>IMPERATIVE TO CONCLUDE THE PROCESS OF INTERNATIONALLY </p><p>DE-RECOGNIZING YUGOSLAVIA. </p><p> </p><p>HONOURABLE MR.

ON THE CONTRARY, SERBIA, </p><p>UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>MONTENEGRO, AND THE YUGOSLAV NATIONAL ARMY HAVE </p><p>EXTENDED THEIR VIOLENCE TO BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA IN ORDER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00558  02 OF 02  141320Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  C-01     DODE-00  HA-09 </p><p>      H-01     INRE-00  INR-01   L-03     ADS-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-02    PM-01    PRS-01   P-02     SCT-03   SNP-01 </p><p>      SP-01    SSO-00   SS-01    TRSE-00  T-01     USIE-00    /032W </p><p>                  ------------------26F2FD  141321Z /38 </p><p>O 141317Z APR 92 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0747 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 00558 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, YO </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIAN PRESIDENT FRANJO TUDJMAN\'S LETTER TO </p><p>PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH </p><p> </p><p>TO PREVENT THE CONVENING OF TALKS ON THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AND THE </p><p>CONCLUSION OF THE PEACE CONFERENCE IN BRUSSELS.
