<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000657 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: REPORTS OF AL-QAIDA ARRESTS IN YEMEN </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM: AGMISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Eleven persons with suspected links to the al-Qaida </p><p>terror network, including two of the Yemeni government\'s </p><p>most-wanted terror suspects, have been arrested in various </p><p>parts of Yemen, according to an April 1 Associated Press </p><p>report datelined Sanaa.  Citing a Yemeni security official, </p><p>AP reported that the eleven suspects are now detained in the </p><p>intelligence prison in Sanaa, and that the two most-wanted </p><p>suspects were arrested last week, but further details were </p><p>not available. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/Noforn) The two "most-wanted suspects" referenced in </p><p>the AP report in all likelihood are Fawaz al-Rabai\'e (aka </p><p>Furqan) and Hamza al-Majali, and ORCA has reported in its </p><p>channels about their recent arrests by Yemeni authorities. </p><p>Identities of the remaining nine suspects, as well as timing </p><p>and circumstances of their arrests are unclear.  The Yemenis </p><p>may have arrested nine new individuals recently; it is just </p><p>as plausible that these "nine" could represent a Yemeni spin </p><p>on their combined total of successful moves against specific </p><p>Al-Qaida individuals over some recent period, or perhaps even </p><p>since August 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) We have no doubt that the AP report was generated by </p><p>sources close to President Salih, likely either Mohamed Sudam </p><p>or Fares Sanibani.  Its purpose was to underline -- for </p><p>anyone to see -- that the ROYG remains firmly committed to </p><p>the pursuit of Al-Qaida terrorists in Yemen (which is clearly </p><p>perceived both in Yemen and across the region as a joint CT </p><p>effort with the USG), notwithstanding ROYG views regarding </p><p>the war with Iraq. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
