<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000048 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TH, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: THAI MINISTERS POISED TO OVERRUN RANGOON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary; At least six Thai ministers and the Chiefs of </p><p>the Thai Armed Services will all parade through Burma during </p><p>January in pursuit of agreements on trade and illegal </p><p>workers, among other issues.  There may also be some action </p><p>on the border in early February between the Burmese and the </p><p>Shan State Army (South). End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Visits </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) There will be a parade of Thai ministers in Rangoon in </p><p>January.  According to Thai Embassy sources, between January </p><p>17 and January 27, the Thai Ministers of Education, Commerce, </p><p>Labor, and Science and Technology, the Chiefs of the Thai </p><p>Armed Services, and Deputy Prime Ministers Chavalit and Korn </p><p>will all visit Burma.  The Thai Minister of Defense and </p><p>Supreme Commander Surayud may also accompany the two Prime </p><p>Ministers. </p><p> </p><p>History </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Education Minister will focus on the treatment of </p><p>Thai/Burmese history in each nation\'s textbooks.  He </p><p>reportedly led the effort to purge Thai textbooks of a lot of </p><p>their anti-Burmese venom and plans to urge the Burmese to </p><p>take similar steps in regard to the anti-Thai propaganda that </p><p>pollutes many of their history books. </p><p> </p><p>Border Trade </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Commerce Minister will try to reach agreement on </p><p>settlement arrangements for border.  The Thai have been </p><p>pushing for some time for an arrangement that would allow the </p><p>settlement of accounts on border trade only once every six </p><p>months, rather than on a transaction-by-transaction basis. </p><p>Normally this would work to Burma\'s benefit, because it would </p><p>allow Burma to run an automatically financed deficit in its </p><p>trade with Thailand, but. given current Burmese efforts to </p><p>crack down on over- and under-invoicing, and on capital </p><p>flight through trade channels, the proposal had not sparked </p><p>much interest among the Burmese.  The Commerce Minister hoped </p><p>to change this during his visit. </p><p> </p><p>Illegal Workers </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Two Deputy Prime Ministers and the Labor Minister </p><p>will focus on illegal Burmese workers in Thailand.  Thailand </p><p>submitted a draft MOU on the repatriation of illegal workers </p><p>to Burma on October 7, but had not received a response. </p><p>Meanwhile, NaSaKa (Burmese border police) officers had begun </p><p>to raise questions about procedures for the return of illegal </p><p>workers.  Basically, NaSaKa wanted to apply the same </p><p>procedures now used on the Bangladeshi border with refugees </p><p>to ensure that all persons who were sent back from Thailand </p><p>really were Burmese citizens.  They also wanted to open only </p><p>one repatriation point (at Myawaddy), rather than the three </p><p>requested by Thailand.  The Thais believed that the Burmese </p><p>procedures were impractical, and hoped to talk them out of </p><p>them during the upcoming meeting.  If they were successful, </p><p>they would sign the MOU on January 27.  If not -- and right </p><p>now that seemed most probable -- then they would talk some </p><p>more. </p><p> </p><p>Insurgents and NGOs </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On other issues, the Thai Embassy sources said that </p><p>the Royal Thai Army had pushed many of the Shan State </p><p>Army-South\'s largest armed units into Burma and was now </p><p>waiting for the Burmese to finish them off, probably with an </p><p>attack in early February.  The Thai sources said that the RTA </p><p>would not block the border, but would not allow the SSA units </p><p>to re-enter Thailand armed.  If they fled the Burmese, they </p><p>would have to leave their arms behind.  As for the NGOs on </p><p>the border, Prime Minister Thaksin had ordered that the rules </p><p>and regulations governing their operations be "streamlined" </p><p>and enforced.  This had spooked some of the NGOs and led to </p><p>protests by many of the European embassies in Bangkok. </p><p>However, there was no intent to shut the NGOs down </p><p>completely, the Thai sources said.  The RTG only wished to </p><p>ensure that they operated fully in accordance with the law. </p><p>The Shan Rape Cases </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Thai Embassy sources also confirmed that the RTG </p><p>had never raised the Shan rape cases with the GOB.  Asked </p><p>why, given the close ethnic relations between the Thai and </p><p>the Shan (Shan is the Burmese word for Siam), the Thai </p><p>officers said that the RTG had questions about the </p><p>reliability of the NGO reports.  The Thai government knew the </p><p>political background of both the Shan Human Rights Foundation </p><p>and the Shan Women\'s Action Network and was not prepared to </p><p>rely on their reports on such inflammatory issues.  The only </p><p>statement on the case to date had been made by the Chairman </p><p>of the Thai Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Committee, but he </p><p>had been speaking individually, not on behalf of the RTG. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  The Thais and Burmese are almost a classic case of </p><p>historic enemies trying to feel their way to a new </p><p>relationship, with Thais, at least for the moment, the </p><p>suitors.  Nothing is easy; every issue is emotionally </p><p>fraught.  Nevertheless, the two sides are making progress. </p><p>If they can strike some agreements in January on the </p><p>treatment of history, border trade and/or illegal workers, </p><p>then the next round of talks should be that much easier. </p><p>However, there is a lot of history to overcome and there is </p><p>always the chance that untoward events will derail the entire </p><p>process. End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
