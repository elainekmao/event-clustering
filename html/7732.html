<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000735 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, DRL </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  04-30-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Reports steadily mount that Tigers are </p><p>assassinating Tamil opponents </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 728, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Reports are steadily mounting that the </p><p>Tigers are assassinating Tamil opponents, especially </p><p>military informants and those in anti-Tiger political </p><p>parties.  The government has been slow in investigating </p><p>the cases, but has recently formed a commission to look </p><p>into the matter.  While the Tigers have killed many </p><p>opponents in the past, the latest attacks seem to have </p><p>shattered a peace process-induced lull.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Alleged Killings by Tigers </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Reports are steadily mounting that the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are assassinating Tamil </p><p>opponents.  The slayings seem to break down distinctly </p><p>into two sorts of victims:  Tamil informants working for </p><p>the military and Tamils working for anti-LTTE political </p><p>parties. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) With respect to the informants, there have been </p><p>two particularly high-profile incidents that have </p><p>recently taken place in the greater Colombo area.  In </p><p>the latest, a Tamil informant working for the Sri Lanka </p><p>Army (SLA) was gunned down in the greater Colombo area </p><p>city of Dehiwala on April 26.  The victim was killed </p><p>just after meeting with his SLA handlers.  Witnesses </p><p>recall seeing a three-wheel taxi roar away right after </p><p>the shots were fired.  A Tamil informant was also killed </p><p>on March 18 in Mount Lavinia, another city located </p><p>immediately south of Colombo.  No one has been arrested </p><p>in either of these killings (see below).  Aside from </p><p>these headline-grabbing incidents, there have been a </p><p>handful of other cases in recent months of Tamil </p><p>military informants (some former, some current) being </p><p>killed in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In terms of Tamil political opponents, the LTTE </p><p>is apparently targeting members of the Eelam People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party (EPDP) and the Tamil Eelam Liberation </p><p>Organization (TELO), two pro-government, anti-LTTE </p><p>former paramilitary groups.  Two prominent EPDP figures, </p><p>for example, were killed in April in the east by pistol </p><p>shots fired at close range.  One of the EPDP members </p><p>killed was an elected official, a councilman for a local </p><p>body in Batticaloa District.  TELO members have also </p><p>been victims of armed attacks, with at least three to </p><p>four slain in the north and east in past weeks. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GSL Slow on the Uptake </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In investigating what has happened, the </p><p>government has been slow on the uptake, and, as far as </p><p>Mission is aware, only three people have been arrested </p><p>in connection with all the killings, and they were soon </p><p>released.  In explaining the GSL\'s apparent inaction re </p><p>the killings, contacts have told us that it is very </p><p>difficult to probe killings in the Tamil community. </p><p>Many Tamils, fearing LTTE retribution, simply refuse to </p><p>speak to the police, for example.  Following the most </p><p>recent incident in the Colombo area, however, the Prime </p><p>Minister -- reacting to a firestorm of public protest </p><p>over the attack -- announced that a commission was being </p><p>set up to investigate the killings of SLA informants. </p><p>The commission is tasked with reporting on what is </p><p>transpiring and who might be to blame in short order. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) (((Note:  Not surprisingly, the LTTE is not </p><p>admitting to the killings.  Pro-LTTE Tamils, in fact, </p><p>have told us that they believe the killings could well </p><p>be a "conspiracy" by the GSL and anti-LTTE Tamils to </p><p>discredit the LTTE.  All that said, however, contacts </p><p>have pointed out that a LTTE official reportedly made a </p><p>statement recently to the effect that "traitors must </p><p>die."  This statement reportedly has acted a spur to </p><p>LTTE cadre to perform such killings.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  One question that has deeply disturbed </p><p>the government and military is how the LTTE might be </p><p>learning the identities of GSL informants in the Tamil </p><p>community.  In answering this question, observers are </p><p>placing the spotlight on a raid by the police on a SLA </p><p>safehouse near Colombo in December 2001.  At the time, </p><p>the raid, which pitted the police versus the army, was a </p><p>cause celebre example of two parts of government failing </p><p>to liaison and work together.  Only later did it turn </p><p>out that information on SLA informants found in the raid </p><p>had apparently fallen into the hands of the LTTE, which </p><p>has allegedly been using the information to bump off </p><p>opponents.   Even more remarkably, some of this </p><p>information reportedly had to do with the super- </p><p>sensitive "deep reconnaissance patrols" that were </p><p>developed to target LTTE leaders.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) While the Tigers have killed many opponents in </p><p>the past, the latest killings seem to have shattered a </p><p>peace process-induced lull.  Given the lack of clear </p><p>evidence and the lack of arrests, however, it is </p><p>difficult to prove Tiger involvement, but all signs </p><p>point in that direction.  After weeks of seemingly </p><p>ignoring the growing problem, it is illustrative of the </p><p>importance of proximity that it was only the killings </p><p>that occurred near the capital of Colombo that stirred </p><p>the government to look at the matter further.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
