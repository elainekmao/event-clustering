DISCUSSIONS INCLUDED AN </p><p>UPDATED APPRAISAL OF WFP\'S OPERATIONAL NEEDS AND THE </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF HUMANITARIAN FACILITIES (PORTS, STORAGE, ICT, </p><p>PARTNERSHIPS, ETC.) AND ITS PLAN FOR AUGMENTED/NEW CAPACITY. </p><p>SEVERAL KEY ISSUES EMERGED:  A) HOW QUICKLY SHOULD WFP PLAN </p><p>ON BEING ABLE TO MOVE CARGOES BY TRUCK INTO THE 18 </p><p>GOVERNORATES; B) PROCEDURES FOR ADDRESSING POTENTIAL </p><p>IN-COUNTRY CBW CONTAMINATION OF TRUCKS; C) CLARIFICATION ON </p><p>POCS FOR BORDER CONTROL ISSUES - INSPECTION REGIMES AND </p><p>CUSTOMS PROCEDURES; D) FEASIBILITY OF HUMANITARIAN SHIPPING </p><p>IN THE GULF AND MODALITIES FOR ESTABLISHING AIR CORRIDORS FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS; AND E) THE NEED TO FINALIZE A COMMON </p><p>DEFINITION OF WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A SAFE AND SECURE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD PERMIT UN HUMANITARIAN PERSONNEL TO </p><p>DEPLOY/RE-DEPLOY INTO IRAQ.

(C)  STRESSING THAT ALTHOUGH NO DECISION HAS YET BEEN </p><p>MADE TO UNDERTAKE MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ, AND THAT TIME FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN CONTINGENCY PLANNING IS RUNNING SHORT, THE HPT </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR WFP TO VERIFY WITH UNSECOORD THE </p><p>COMPLETENESS OF DATA PROVIDED TO THE USG ON WFP ASSET </p><p>LOCATION WITHIN IRAQ, INCLUDING OFFICES, WAREHOUSING </p><p>FACILITIES, TRUCK DEPOTS, NAMES OF PERSONNEL EMPLOYED, ETC. </p><p>WFP AGREED TO DO SO.  IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT, IN MANY OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT WAREHOUSING COMPLEXES IN THE CAPITALS </p><p>OF THE 18 GOVERNORATES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE OFF RATION </p><p>DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, WFP HAD ACCESS TO/KNOWLEDGE OF ONLY </p><p>THOSE PARTS OF THE COMPLEXES WHICH DEALT WITH FOOD STORAGE </p><p>AND MOVEMENT.  THE HPT EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR THE USG TO </p><p>HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THE </p><p>SENSITIVITY OF HAVING IT PASSED TO THE USG BY WFP. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ISSUES REVIEWED </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.
