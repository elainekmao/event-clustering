SUMMARY:  WAR IN IRAQ DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND </p><p>ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  A PROMINENT THEME OF EDITORIALS IS "U.S. </p><p>NEGLIGENCE OF ALL INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS."  AN \'AL </p><p>ITTIHAD\' EDITORIAL STRESSED THE URGENCY OF PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN </p><p>AID FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  AN \'AKHBAR AL ARAB\' EDITORIAL </p><p>DESCRIBED THE ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS AROUND THE WORLD AS "A </p><p>VOLCANO OF ANGER."   UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN LASHED OUT IN AN </p><p>OP-ED AGAINST ARAB IMPOTENCE IN THE CURRENT SITUATION.  ALL LOCAL </p><p>ENGLISH AND ARABIC DAILIES GAVE POSITIVE COVERAGE TO ANTI- </p><p>AMERICAN AND ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY </p><p>THOSE IN THE ARAB WORLD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN A REFERENCE TO REMARKS BY U/S MARC GROSSMAN AT THE FOREIGN </p><p>PRESS CENTER ON MARCH 19, THE NUMBER TWO FRONT-PAGE HEADLINE IN </p><p>PAN-ARAB \'AL KHALEEJ\' ON 3/22 READ: "U.S. WANTS A \'NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT\' (OF IRAQ) WHICH WILL RECOGNIZE ISRAEL." </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON 3/22, ENGLISH AND ARABIC DAILIES HIGHLIGHTED, WITH COLOR </p><p>PHOTOGRAPHS, THE HOISTING OF THE AMERICAN FLAG AT UM QASR PORT. </p><p>DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED \'AL BAYAN,\' \'AL KHALEEJ,\' AND DUBAI- </p><p>BASED ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY \'GULF NEWS\' CARRIED EDITORIALS, OP- </p><p>EDS AND NEWS REPORTS THAT THE U.S. IS DETERMINED TO OCCUPY, </p><p>RATHER THAN LIBERATE, IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON AMERICAN CONCERN FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE, \'AL </p><p>KHALEEJ\' EDITORIALIZED ON 03/22: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. BELIEVES THAT SAVING THE PEOPLE OF A COUNTRY MEANS </p><p>KILLING THEM, THEN DESTROYING THEIR COUNTRY AS A PRELUDE TO </p><p>OCCUPYING IT ... THE REASON FOR THE BUSH-BLAIR WAR IS TAKING UP </p><p>COLONIAL RESIDENCE IN THE HEART OF THE ARAB REGION, AS IF ISRAEL </p><p>AND ALL THE CATASTROPHES IT HAS BROUGHT TO THIS REGION FOR THE </p><p>LAST 55 YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH." </p><p> </p><p>5.  DESCRIBING THE WORLDWIDE DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE WAR IN </p><p>IRAQ AS "A VOLCANO OF ANGER," "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 03/22: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT IS VERY FRIGHTENING IS THAT THE U.S. IS ACTING WITH NO </p><p>CONSIDERATION FOR ANY INTERNATIONAL LAWS.  DURING THE OLD DAYS OF </p><p>OCCUPATION, THERE WERE NO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN </p><p>SECURITY IN THE WORLD, AS OPPOSED TO NOW, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS NOT </p><p>EASY AT THAT TIME TO REPEL THE OCCUPIERS.  HISTORY INFORMS US </p><p>THAT MOST COLONIAL NATIONS AGREED AMONGST THEMSELVES TO DIVIDE UP </p><p>THE WORLD AND ITS RESOURCES.  IT SEEMS THAT THE U.S. HAS </p><p>ABANDONED ITS BETTER NATURE, AND INSTEAD OF SERVING AS A ROLE </p><p>MODEL FOR OTHER COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF ITS POWER IN THE WORLD, IT </p><p>IS ABANDONING ALL INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  THE </p><p>"VOLCANO OF ANGER" (THE DEMONSTRATIONS) WILL SPREAD ALL OVER THE </p><p>WORLD, IF NOT ONLY FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE, THEN ALSO FOR THE </p><p>DIGNITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS BEEN MORTALLY </p><p>WOUNDED BECAUSE OF THE U.S. ATTACKS ON IRAQ" </p><p> </p><p>6.  NOTING THAT THERE ARE TWO LOSERS IN THIS WAR, ABU DHABI-BASED </p><p>PAN-ARAB DAILY \'AKHBAR AL ARAB\' EDITORIALIZED ON 03/22: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE SURE THING IS THAT THE FIRST LOSER AND VICTIM OF THIS </p><p>WAR IS THE POOR IRAQI PEOPLE, WHO HAVE FACED THREE WARS DURING </p><p>THE PAST TWO DECADES AND PAID THE PRICE IN THEIR OWN BLOOD AND </p><p>RESOURCES FOR THE DEADLY MISTAKES OF THEIR REGIME ... AS FOR THE </p><p>SECOND LOSER, IT IS DEFINITELY THE UN AND ALL ITS COMPONENTS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE SECURITY COUNCIL; THE US, UK, AND SPAIN HAVE </p><p>HAMMERED THE FIRST AND PERHAPS LAST NAIL INTO ITS COFFIN ... </p><p>DIVIDING IRAQ INTO SMALL ETHNIC AREAS WILL NOT BENEFIT THE </p><p>REGION, NOT EVEN THE U.S.  THE ONLY BENEFICIARY OF THIS IS </p><p>ISRAEL, WHICH ALWAYS LOOKS TO PROFIT FROM SUCH CRISES IN ORDER TO </p><p>MOVE BEYOND THE BORDERS OF PALESTINE ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  EMPHASIZING THE URGENT NEED FOR HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>AND AID TO REACH THE IRAQI PEOPLE, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT \'AL ITTIHAD\' EDITORIALIZED ON 03/22: </p><p> </p><p>"... MOST IMPORTANT IS TO OBTAIN A SERIOUS AND SPEEDY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MOVE TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN AID SUCH AS FOOD AND </p><p>MEDICINE TO IRAQ AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THIS WILL REQUIRE </p><p>COOPERATION FROM ALL WORLD DONORS AND A QUICK RESPONSE IN ORDER </p><p>TO START THE NECESSARY HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS ..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN AN IMPASSIONED CRITIQUE OF ARAB IMPOTENCE, UAE COLUMNIST </p><p>AYSHA IBRAHIM SULTAN WROTE IN \'AL BAYAN\' ON 3/22: </p><p> </p><p>"... FORGIVE US, OH IRAQ, AS PALESTINE FORGAVE US BEFORE, BUT OUR </p><p>HEARTS ARE WITH YOU, WE PRAY FOR YOU ... YOU, OH IRAQ, WHO IS </p><p>PAYING THE BILL OF CENTURIES INSTEAD OF US ... FIRST CAME THE </p><p>TATARS AND FINALLY CAME THE (U.S.) LATTER-DAY TATARS TO TEACH YOU </p><p>A LESSON AND STOP YOU FROM RAISING YOUR HEAD WITH GLORY ... TODAY </p><p>WE ARE ALL IRAQ, AND IRAQ HAS REACHED OUT ITS HANDS FOR OUR HELP; </p><p>HOW WILL WE ATONE FOR OUR DISGRACE?" </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
