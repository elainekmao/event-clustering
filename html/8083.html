<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 003206 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF READOUT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  IMF resident rep in Ankara briefed us May </p><p>13 on the status of the Fifth Review.  Given the number of </p><p>unmet conditions at this point, the earliest date for the </p><p>Fifth Review Board meeting is likely to be early July.  While </p><p>the GOT may meet its primary surplus criterion, there are </p><p>underlying fiscal weaknesses, exacerbated by plans for more </p><p>amnesties (especially an amnesty on employers payments of </p><p>social security premiums).  On structural reforms, the </p><p>parliament passed the direct tax reform law, but there are </p><p>delays on eliminating  public sector redundancies.  The Turk </p><p>Telekom privatization plan adopted by the Counci of Ministers </p><p>doesn\'t pass Fund or Bank muster. Resrep was fairly </p><p>optimistic about growth (meeting the 5 percent target should </p><p>be achievable) and guarded on inflation (too early to revise </p><p>the 20 percent CPI target).   But the Fifth Review could well </p><p>be difficult, given the amnesty talk by the GOT.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In a May 13 meeting, IMF resrep briefed us on the </p><p>status of the Fifth Review.   The staff mission will begin on </p><p>May 21 and  end by May 31 (since outgoing Turkish Mission </p><p>Chief Kahkonen takes up a new job on June 2.)   Resrep </p><p>believes Fund staff will not be in a position to recommend a </p><p>Board date by the end of this Mission, given the large number </p><p>of outstanding conditions detailed below. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Resrep was generally optimistic about Turkey\'s </p><p>macroeconomic performance.  On growth, even if Turkey only </p><p>stays at the level of fourth quarter 2002 GNP, it will obtain </p><p>about 2 percent growth over 2003; preliminary indications </p><p>show growth above the fourth quarter baseline.   Growth </p><p>remains uneven, with export industries performing well, and </p><p>many domestically oriented companies still stagnant. </p><p>Reaching the 20 percent year-end CPI inflation target will be </p><p>challenging, given 10 percent cumulative inflation in thie </p><p>first four months.  This means averaging about one percent </p><p>CPI inflation per month for th rest of the year.  But Fund </p><p>staff are unlikely to recommend revising the target at this </p><p>point. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Quantitative Targets - Focus on The Budget </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Resrep said Turkey had met all monetary targets. </p><p>The debt ceiling numbers were not yet in, but he believes </p><p>those will be met as well.   The primary surplus performance </p><p>criterion is the big question, and the final numbers </p><p>(including state economic enterprise balances) will not be in </p><p>until mid-June.   Resrep opined that it appeared from </p><p>preliminary data that the GOT would met the primary surplus </p><p>condition, owing to better-than-projected revenue in April </p><p>from the tax amnesty.   However, there was continuing </p><p>weaknesses in other areas, particularly in the social </p><p>security funds.   Employers\' premium payments have dropped </p><p>off considerably (because of talk of another amnesty on </p><p>arrearages), forcing greater transfers from the budget to </p><p>keep the funds solvent.  If the GOT met the end April primary </p><p>surplus condition through one-off measurse like the tax </p><p>amnesty and its partial spending freeze, with ongoing </p><p>weaknesses, then the budgetary balances looking forward would </p><p>be problematic, per Resrep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU) The Fund is unhappy with the GOT\'s proposed </p><p>amnesties/reschedulings of social security and electricity </p><p>arrearages, which conflict with its commitment, in the Letter </p><p>of Intent, not to engage in general reschedulings of public </p><p>sector receivables.  ResRep said Deputy Managing Director </p><p>Krueger had been tough on this issue during her recent visit, </p><p>warning that it would complicate the Fifth Review, but GOT </p><p>officials had insisted they would go ahead anyway.  State </p><p>Planning Organization Deputy U/S Birol Aydemir had explained </p><p>to Fund staff that the social security amnesty was not a </p><p>general rescheduling but rather a specific one.  ResRep said </p><p>he has already received a copy of proposed legislation on </p><p>social security arrears. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Resrep acknowledged that revenues from Turkey\'s </p><p>"tax peace" would be higher than the Fund had estimated, as </p><p>payments totaling TL 800 trillion had already been made in </p><p>April.  Nonetheless, he predicted that, because local tax </p><p>officials had taken a heavy handed approach, many of those </p><p>who had signed up would drop out during the year.  He </p><p>confirmed what we had been told earlier by Finance Ministry </p><p>U/S  - that the majority of any additional revnues, beyond </p><p>the amount projected in the budget, would be used to pay down </p><p>domestic debt.  In addition, some TL 310 trillion would be </p><p>spent on relief for farmers, specifically a diesel fuel </p><p>subsidy.   Resrep noted two problems with this subsidy. </p><p>First, the World Bank wanted aid to farmers to be channeled </p><p>into the currentl under-funded Direct Income Support program, </p><p>which is more efficient; the GOT was characterizing the </p><p>diesel fuel subsidy as part of this program when it clearly </p><p>wasn\'t.   Second, this subsidy from the IMF point of view was </p><p>an ad hoc spending measure outside the budget and undermined </p><p>the budget prioritization process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Structural Reforms </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Resrep gave a status report, showing mixed results, </p><p>on the major structural conditions (both performance criteria </p><p>and benchmarks) in the Fifth Review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Public Sector Reforms: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Parliamentary passage of the direct tax reform law was </p><p>completed April 9. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Parliamentary passage by end June of the Public Financial </p><p>Management Law, which will make the budget much more </p><p>transparent (it will include for instance the military </p><p>procurement spending):  the legislation has been drafted and </p><p>is circulating among the Council of MInister prior to </p><p>submission to parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Parliamentary passage of Bankruptcy law amendments by end </p><p>May:  some delay, but law is in parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Parliamentary passage of amendments to the State Economic </p><p>Enterprise governance laws, in June, which is intended to </p><p>make the SEEs more autonomous from political control:  draft </p><p>now in parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Reduce 9,900 redundant public sector jobs by end June: </p><p>only about 2,000 jobs eliminated thus far.  The GOT has </p><p>delegated the downsizing to state enterprise managers, but PM </p><p>Erdogan will need to exert continued pressure to achieve the </p><p>condition, per Resrep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Banking Sector Reforms: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Announce sale by end June of first tranche of $250 </p><p>million in assets from the intervened banks:  some resistance </p><p>in BRSA until the new bankruptcy law is in place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Prepare legislation by end June to strengthen BRSA\'s </p><p>ability to intervene failed banks (by limiting the period of </p><p>legal appeals):  BRSA has prepared a draft. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Develop an action plan by end May to reduce financial </p><p>intermediation costs:  some resistance from the Finance </p><p>Ministry to reducing transaction taxes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Private Sector Enhancements: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Council of MInisters approval of Turk Telekom </p><p>privatization plan by end April:  the plan adopted doesn\'t </p><p>meet World Bank or IMF standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Parliamentary passage of new Foreign Direct Investment law </p><p>by end-April:  the law is in parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) ResRep said AK plans to amend the public </p><p>procurement law were problematic.   The amendments are being </p><p>done at AK party headquarters, outside the GOT.  At a </p><p>minimum, the GOT needs to consult with the World Bank and </p><p>Fund before going forward with the amendments.  There are, he </p><p>admitted, technical problems with implementing some </p><p>provisions of the Public Procurement Law, and the IFIs want </p><p>to help the GOT establish standards that conform with EU </p><p>practice.   The bottom line, however, is that AK has to </p><p>coordinate with the IFIs, which it is not doing, he </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New Treasury Undersecretary Reaffirms Commitment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Treasury U/S Ibrahim Canakci told us May 13 that </p><p>Prime Minister Erdogan had made a strong commitment to IMF </p><p>Deputy Managing Director Krueger to implement the reform </p><p>program fully.  Erdogan, briefed by Krueger on the welter of </p><p>pending conditions in the Fifth Review, had instructed State </p><p>Minister Babacan and Canakci to make it happen.  Canakci said </p><p>he thought Turkey was in good shape on its macro targets and </p><p>was making good progress on most structural reforms, though </p><p>he acknowledged they had identified some problem areas. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
