<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000666 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W AND DRL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, EPET, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: RIVERS STATE VIOLENCE COULD IMPACT OIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) In an April 4 conversation with Embassy CRO, Movement </p><p>for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) representative </p><p>Chris Newsom (New Zealand national), warned of a dramatic </p><p>increase in electoral violence in Rivers State due primarily </p><p>to hotly contested gubernatorial and local races. According </p><p>to Newsom, violence against opposition ANPP candidates had </p><p>reached very serious levels.  Only a few of the more dramatic </p><p>examples of this have reached the international media (e.g. </p><p>the March 29 attack on an ANPP rally in Baraka, a few </p><p>kilometers outside of Port Harcourt).  However, thugs </p><p>frequently disrupted ANPP rallies, but these incidents go </p><p>unreported, he claimed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Newsom predicted that the aftermath of the election </p><p>will be a continuation of the violence that preceded it. </p><p>Whoever wins, the loser will be angry and blame his loss on </p><p>the victor\'s fraudulent influences over the election. </p><p>Ethnicity will play a role in this because Governor Odili </p><p>knows the Ogoni oppose his return.  Newsom also echoed a </p><p>familiar refrain heard among the opposition: the Governor, </p><p>Deputy Governor and National Assemby members will fight tooth </p><p>and nail to retain office so that they can ensure their </p><p>immunity from prosecution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) On April 9 CRO visited ANPP gubernatorial candidate </p><p>Chief Sergeant Awuse in Mgbuetor, on the outskirts of Port </p><p>Harcourt.  Awuse was angry about reports received only an </p><p>hour earlier of an attack on houses in Mgbeutor, including </p><p>the houses of his relatives and his personal assistant. </p><p>Awuse claimed this attack was carried out by PDP supporters. </p><p>CRO later visited the affected neighborhood, taking </p><p>photographs of the damaged buildings and vehicles (digital </p><p>vehicles will be e-mailed to DRL and AF/W). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) According to several residents interviewed, </p><p>approximately 20 young men from neighboring villages came in </p><p>with guns, large sticks and knives and began breaking </p><p>windows, doors, appliances and furniture in the houses.  The </p><p>attackers reportedly told the residents they would be back </p><p>that night to inflict more damage.  CRO saw several residents </p><p>packing personal belongings into vehicles, saying they were </p><p>afraid to remain in the village.  Some residents claimed the </p><p>attackers were looking for Awuse personal assistant. Visibly </p><p>enraged by the attack on his and his parents\' home, the </p><p>assistant stated that he could "not let this attack go </p><p>without a response."  "His boys" would counter-attack, he </p><p>vowed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Newsom claimed that established civil society groups in </p><p>Port Harcourt are pessimistic about peaceful elections in </p><p>Rivers.  He said Rivers indigenes were watching the Warri </p><p>crisis closely.  People were predicting that the electoral </p><p>violence and underlying tensions could erupt into an outburst </p><p>similar to Warri -- where a group might try to shut-down oil </p><p>production in an attempt to advance their cause. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6.(C)  Newsom is a relative newcomer to Nigeria and is wedded </p><p>to MOSOP, the best known and most influential , but not the </p><p>only community organization among the Ogoni.   There is no </p><p>love lost between MOSOP and Governor Odili and, by extension, </p><p>between MOSOP and most of the PDP in the state.  Thus, what </p><p>Newsom says must be taken with a grain of salt.  His general </p><p>characterization of political violence in Rivers State is </p><p>accurate but the instigation of it is not as one-sided as </p><p>Newsom described. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Talk among local thugs about shutting down oil </p><p>production maybe be braggadocio or an attempt to extort local </p><p>authorities and the oil companies; however, such talk cannot </p><p>be dismissed summarily.  As both we and the GON have fear, </p><p>the situation in Warrai could be repeated elsewhere in the </p><p>volatile Niger Delta. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
