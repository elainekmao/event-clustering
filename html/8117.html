<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003268 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, AJ, GG, ETTC, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA RAISES KIRKUK-YUMARTALIK PIPELINE AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3036 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Couns Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This cable contains an action request.  See para 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Deputy Under Secretary for Economic Affairs Alev </p><p>Kilic and Director General For Energy Hakki Akil told Econ </p><p>Couns May 15 that, as the MFA had told us previously </p><p>(reftel), the lack of oil flow in the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik </p><p>pipeline was having a corrosive affect on the pipe and the </p><p>storage tanks at Ceyhan.  Econ Couns emphasized that the </p><p>quickest way to get Iraqi oil flowing again was passage of </p><p>the U.N. sanctions lift resolution, and again urged full </p><p>Turkish support of that resolution.  Kilic and Akil responded </p><p>that the corrosive affect was increasingly daily and this </p><p>could not wait "two to three weeks." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Action request:  We cannot confirm that the corrosive </p><p>impact is significant and increasingly daily, as the MFA </p><p>claims.  Post would appreciate any guidance Department could </p><p>provide to the MFA\'s inquiry on this issue, and on the </p><p>technical aspects of the MFA\'s claim. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
