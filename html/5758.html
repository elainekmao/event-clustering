<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000453 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR P, IO/UNP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/16/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, CA, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: SECRETARY POWELL\'S ADDRESS TO SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL FEBRUARY 14 </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 44441 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires a.i. Stephen R. Kelly, Reasons:  1.5 ( </p><p>B and D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Charge contacted Canadian Political Director Jim </p><p>Wright Feb. 16 to urge that Canada make a statement on Iraq </p><p>during the Feb. 18 UNSC Open Meeting.    Wright said he had </p><p>already drafted such a statement for Foreign Minister Graham </p><p>- one which tracks very well with the talking points reftel - </p><p>and was recommending that Canada use this chance to put its </p><p>views before the entire UNSC.  Wright said he would let the </p><p>minister know we had indeed urged Canada to take this step. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Wright said his draft statement makes the following </p><p>points: </p><p> </p><p>--    Canada believes the fundamental issue is that Iraq has </p><p>not accepted the need to disarm itself. </p><p> </p><p>--    Intensified inspections are not the answer.  The answer </p><p>is a change in attitude on the part of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--    If Iraq was providing willing, active and transparent </p><p>cooperation to the inspectors, the inspection process could </p><p>be very short. </p><p> </p><p>--    Canada continues to say it wants the issued resolved </p><p>through the United Nations. </p><p> </p><p>--    A divided UNSC serves no one\'s purposes. </p><p> </p><p>--    Time is clearly running out. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)   Wright said he had followed the Secretary\'s Feb. 14 </p><p>statement very closely.  He was urging FM Graham to use the </p><p>Open Meeting as an opportunity for Canada to put its views </p><p>before all the UNSC members before they meet on a possible </p><p>second resolution, with the intention of putting the onus of </p><p>action on the council and the Iraqis..  He said he would have </p><p>a chance to discuss this more with the U.S. this week in </p><p>Paris at the G-8 political directors meeting, where he would </p><p>see Under Secretary for Political Affairs Marc Grossman. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Comment:  Wright stressed that Graham had not yet </p><p>signed off on his draft, nor definitively decided to make a </p><p>statement.  But on the latter point he asked, "Why wouldn\'t </p><p>we?", and on the former, he implied his minister would be on </p><p>board.  End Comment. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
