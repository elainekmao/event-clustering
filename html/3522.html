<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002415 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF, AF/W, AF/RA AND CA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: CASC, PREL, OPRC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING EVOKES STRONG POLITICAL REACTION IN </p><p>NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: BROWNE-EPSTEIN E-MAILS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASONS 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The August 8 State Department Travel Warning has </p><p>evoked highly negative reactions in Nigeria.  Many in the </p><p>Nigerian Government (GON) are interpreting the travel </p><p>warning as a sign of deep U.S. disappointment and </p><p>dissatisfaction with the Obasanjo Administration and a </p><p>deliberate and even hostile act.  The administration\'s </p><p>opponents are pointing to the Travel Warning as a sign that </p><p>President Obasanjo is no longer in good favor with the </p><p>United States.  Reports on the Travel Warning were carried </p><p>in ten newspapers over the August 10-11 week-end, and was </p><p>the lead story on radio and TV; commentary and editorials </p><p>have continued throughout the week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Nigerian Foreign Minister Sule Lamido and ruling </p><p>PDP Party Chairman Audu Ogbeh spoke publicly with passion </p><p>about the Travel Warning, and expressed their </p><p>disappointment with the United States, a country, they </p><p>said, Nigeria has considered a close friend and ally.  A </p><p>Special Assistant in the Office approached the Ambassador </p><p>on August 14, asking "why does America hate Nigeria so </p><p>much," and pointed out the damaging effect that the Travel </p><p>Warning would have on Nigeria\'s fledgling efforts to </p><p>attract foreign investment.  (Comment: the August 14 "New </p><p>Nigerian" newspaper claimed that the Australian Government </p><p>recalled two trade missions that were already in Nigeria, </p><p>claiming that the country was not safe.  End comment.)  The </p><p>sponsors of an upcoming arts festival called the Ambassador </p><p>to request a letter to the invited American participants to </p><p>assure them that it was still possible to visit Nigeria for </p><p>the event, and that their lives would not be in danger. </p><p>(COMMENT:  Prince Pat Abii, National Coordinator for the </p><p>Obasanjo/Atiku Peoples Democratic Project, one of the </p><p>informal groups established to promote Obasanjo\'s </p><p>reelection, confided to PolCouns that FM Lamido had </p><p>privately told her that the Travel Warning was factual and </p><p>that he had no personal qualms with it. However, given the </p><p>political storm it has caused, Lamido felt compelled to </p><p>make a public comment in an attempt to pre-empt critics of </p><p>the administration.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Timing more than content of the Travel Warning was </p><p>what seemed to rankle GON officials most.  The Travel </p><p>Warning followed a string of bad press on Nigeria in recent </p><p>weeks, including a stinging CNN report on 4-1-9, a "Money </p><p>magazine" article on financial fraud, and internet-posted </p><p>comments from a recent Center for Strategic and </p><p>International Studies (CSIS) meeting on Nigeria that </p><p>painted a gloomy picture of Nigeria\'s upcoming 2003 </p><p>elections and prejudged their credibility.  The August 13 </p><p>release of Nigeria\'s Human Rights Report, which </p><p>characterized the GON\'s human rights record as "poor," </p><p>contributed to this already defensive environment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Political opponents of Obasanjo have applauded and </p><p>welcomed the Travel Warning, saying that it confirms how </p><p>discredited the Obasanjo Administrations really is.  This </p><p>comes at a time when the National Assembly, angry at the </p><p>President for holding the line on government spending, has </p><p>called on Obasanjo to resign and passed a motion for his </p><p>impeachment (septel).  Senate President Anyim, once an </p><p>Obasanjo ally, cited the warning as a reason for the </p><p>National Assembly to hold a session to debate the </p><p>administration\'s performance on internal security.  The </p><p>President\'s Special Assistant also claimed that the Warning </p><p>has also played into the hands of some of Nigeria\'s most </p><p>corrupt legislators who will use it to leverage concessions </p><p>from the President not to oppose their bids for re- </p><p>election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Drawing on the Department\'s press guidance, the </p><p>Embassy has issued a press statement explaining the purpose </p><p>of the Travel Warning and debunking charges that the </p><p>warning was an effort to harm Nigeria.  The statement was </p><p>welcomed by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs who has requested that we post it on the </p><p>Internet.  The Ambassador also plans to hold an interview </p><p>with three of Nigeria\'s leading dailies on Monday, August </p><p>19, in an effort to clear the air. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  GON anger over the August 8 Travel Warning </p><p>eventually will pass, although it has generated suspicions, </p><p>within the administration and among its critics, that the </p><p>U.S. is distancing itself from the embattled Obasanjo </p><p>government.  The uproar over the Travel Warning </p><p>demonstrates and highlights the enormous sensitivities </p><p>inherent in Nigeria\'s current political environment.  In </p><p>the local context, our Travel Warning became a political </p><p>statement, not an advisory to American citizens.  The </p><p>sensitivity will only increase as elections draw nearer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Embassy first learned about the release of the </p><p>Travel Warning from the August 10-11 reports in the </p><p>Nigerian press.  While most of the content of the Warning </p><p>is not in dispute, the Embassy could have lessened the </p><p>negative impact of its release through advance consultation </p><p>and an opportunity to brief senior GON officials ahead of </p><p>its release.  Moreover, the timing of the Warning\'s release </p><p>could no have been worse, given the domestic political </p><p>situation in Nigeria.  As it stands, the unanticipated </p><p>release of this Warning supports the growing belief in the </p><p>Obasanjo government that the USG is complicit in an effort </p><p>to undermine the GON\'s credibility on the approach to the </p><p>2003 elections. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
