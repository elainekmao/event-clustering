Paul Bremer </p><p>Office of the Coalition Provisional Authority </p><p>Baghdad - Iraq </p><p> </p><p>Subject:  Baghdad Commercial Air Service </p><p> </p><p>Dear Sir, </p><p> </p><p>We are pleased to write you with reference to the notice </p><p>issued by your office, OCPA, on July 2nd, inviting airlines </p><p>interested in providing scheduled passenger commercial air </p><p>transport to and from Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>Alitalia, Linee Aeree Italiane S.p.A., hereby submits its </p><p>application to perform scheduled air services between Italy </p><p>and Baghdad, reinstating an air link which in the past has </p><p>proven to be very important for the development of economic </p><p>and cultural ties between Iraq and the Republic of Italy. </p><p> </p><p>Alitalia-Linee Aeree Italiane S.p.A., is a company organized </p><p>and existing under the laws of the Italian Republic, having </p><p>its Head Office at Viale Alessandro Marchetti 111-00148 Rome </p><p>and has a fleet of 170 aircraft, ranging from regional, </p><p>short-medium haul to long haul equipment. </p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, Alitalia has developed over the years a </p><p>widespread system of bilateral and multilateral partnerships, </p><p>which enable us to offer seamless service to a broad range of </p><p>destinations:  the core of this strategy is the membership in </p><p>the SkyTeam Alliance, whose other members are Delta Airlines, </p><p>Air France, Korean Air, Aeromexico, Czech Airlines. </p><p> </p><p>Alitalia is the Italian designated airline under the </p><p>Italy-Iraq Air Services Agreement, as signed in 1963 and </p><p>amended in 1976.  Pursuant to such ASA, Alitalia has been </p><p>performing scheduled air services operating two wide body </p><p>frequencies per week from Italy to Baghdad till the early </p><p>\'80s. </p><p> </p><p>Alitalia is a signatory of the IATA Intercarrier Agreement on </p><p>Passenger Liability and of the IATA Agreement on Measures to </p><p>Implement the IATA Intercarrier Agreement.  Alitalia also </p><p>meets US FAA International Aviation Safety requirements and </p><p>regulations, operating out of an FAA Category 1 country and </p><p>holds the insurance coverage required by the Italian and </p><p>International laws and regulations. </p><p> </p><p>In light of the foreseen reopening of Baghdad International </p><p>Airport, Alitalia, wishing to effectively support the </p><p>reconstruction and development of the civil aviation in Iraq, </p><p>is requesting to reinstate its operations, in the course of </p><p>the upcoming IATA Winter Season 2003/2004; as we expect a </p><p>meaningful growth of air services demand due to the global </p><p>effort, we plan to reach, within approximately two IATA </p><p>seasons from start up, a daily service pattern, possibly in </p><p>code-sharing cooperation with our Sky Team Alliance partners. </p><p> </p><p>Depending on the operational and logistical capabilities of </p><p>Baghdad International Airport, the starting operational </p><p>pattern shall be performing on a three weekly services basis, </p><p>on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, deploying either B767 or </p><p>A320 equipment. </p><p> </p><p>The routing being considered, based on the information </p><p>currently available and taking into account the goodwill and </p><p>flexibility of neighbouring nations, provides for a direct or </p><p>via intermediate point service from Rome/Milan to Baghdad; </p><p>the operational as well as infrastructural capabilities of </p><p>Baghdad International Airport will also play a key role when </p><p>firming timings and scheduling details.  In any case, flight </p><p>schedules will aim to adequately satisfy the demand of </p><p>traffic flows originating and terminating in Iraq or in </p><p>Italy, as well as traffic flows connecting through Italy to </p><p>destinations worldwide. </p><p> </p><p>We take the liberty to underline that Italy appears, for the </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>above mentioned historical and economic reasons, on top of a </p><p>fortunate geographic location, as the most suitable gateway </p><p>between Iraq and the western world. </p><p> </p><p>Fare structures currently being considered, take into account </p><p>the social and economical environment and reflect standard </p><p>Alitalia practice within the region. </p><p> </p><p>Alitalia, in light of the need to provide an efficient, safe </p><p>and reliable air tranportation service, will need to verify </p><p>in place, with a specific team, all issues regarding </p><p>logistical, crews and aircraft assistance requirements, in </p><p>close cooperation with your office and local authorities. </p><p> </p><p>Thanking you in advance for the attention and support you </p><p>will give to Alitalia\'s application, Alitalia would like to </p><p>reiterate its willingness in assisting and actively </p><p>participating in the ongoing effort to reconstruct and </p><p>develop the economy of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Yours Sincerely, </p><p>(signed) </p><p>Francesco Mengozzi </p><p>Managing Director and CEO </p><p>Alitalia </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03109 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
