THE VATICAN\'S CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM ABOUT BIOTECHNOLOGY WAS </p><p>GIVEN A BOOST BY A JULY 5 MEETING POST ORGANIZED BETWEEN </p><p>SENIOR GOVERNMENT EXPERTS AND DR. CHANNAPATNA PRAKASH, </p><p>PROFESSOR OF PLANT MOLECULAR GENETICS AT TUSKEGEE </p><p>UNIVERSITY, ALABAMA AND MEMBER OF THE USDA\'S AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THE VATICAN CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>IT HAS FEWER PROBLEMS WITH THE SCIENCE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY THAN </p><p>WITH THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ETHICAL ISSUES LINKED TO THE </p><p>PROCESSES. THE PROTAGONISTS AGREED THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY HAD </p><p>THE POTENTIAL TO COMBAT WORLD HUNGER BY DEVELOPING DISEASE </p><p>AND PEST RESISTANT PLANTS. VATICAN OFFICIALS EXPRESSED </p><p>PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE PROCESSES TO INCREASE THE </p><p>NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF SOME GRAINS AND PLANTS. THE VATICAN </p><p>APPROACH TO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIO-ETHICS IN GENERAL IS BASED </p><p>ON "REASONABLE PRUDENCE." POST ARRANGED VATICAN MEDIA EVENTS </p><p>TO FURTHER DISSEMINATE PRAKASH\'S MESSAGE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>LOVE THE IDEA, BUT... </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   MEMBERS AND CONSULTANTS OF THE VATICAN\'S BIO-ETHICAL </p><p>INSTITUTE, THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE, DISCUSSED THE </p><p>PROS AND CONS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY WITH PROFESSOR CHANNAPATNA </p><p>PRAKASH DURING A JULY 5 MEETING ORGANIZED BY POST IN VATICAN </p><p>CITY. THE SCIENTIFIC ENCOUNTER WAS CHAIRED BY THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03621  01 OF 02  091519Z </p><p>"MINISTER" FOR BIO-ETHICAL ISSUES, BISHOP ELIO SGRECCIA. </p><p>SGRECCIA WELCOMED THE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>REFLECTION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FROM THE START OF THE </p><p>MEETING IT WAS CLEAR THAT VATICAN PARTICIPANTS WERE, IN </p><p>THEORY, FAVORABLE TO THE BENEFITS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY FOR DEVELOPING NATIONS. THE SCIENTISTS DID </p><p>EXPRESS CONCERN OVER THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF GMOS AS </p><p>PRODUCTS OF DOMINEERING WESTERN MULTINATIONALS, OFTEN </p><p>LABELED AS "DIABOLICAL." PONTIFICAL ACADEMY MEMBERS </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT DEVELOPING NATIONS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED AND </p><p>ASSISTED TO DEVELOP IN-HOUSE SOLUTIONS TO THEIR FOOD AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE PROBLEMS. THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT ABOUT THE </p><p>POTENTIAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY BUT THE VATICAN DELEGATION </p><p>INSISTED ON ADEQUATE CONTROLS TO MANAGE EXTRINSIC RISKS. </p><p>PRAKASH POINTED OUT THAT IN THE US THE EPA, USDA AND FDA </p><p>KEEP CLOSE SCRUTINY ON NEW BIOTECH PRODUCTS. ALL AGREED THAT </p><p>KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING IMPACTED DIRECTLY ON THE PUBLIC </p><p>PERCEPTION OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GMOS. </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE VATICAN DELEGATION INSISTED THAT EACH NEW BIOTECH </p><p>PRODUCT SHOULD RECEIVE A SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT AND APPROVAL. </p><p>IT REJECTED THE IDEA OF A GENERAL APPROVAL OF GMOS. THEY </p><p>ALSO CALLED FOR COUNTRY SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT AND APPROVAL. </p><p>ONE ACADEMICIAN POINTED OUT THAT ONLY 20 PERCENT OF U.S. </p><p>LAND IS DEDICATED TO AGRICULTURE COMPARED TO 80 PERCENT OF </p><p>ITALY\'S. HE OPINED THAT THE RISK FACTOR IN A NEW BIOTECH </p><p>PRODUCT WAS GREATER FOR A COUNTRY LIKE ITALY THAN FOR THE </p><p>US. THE VATICAN DELEGATES SAID THEIR APPROACH TO GENETIC </p><p>SCIENCES IN GENERAL WAS GLOBAL IN NATURE AND THAT THEY </p><p>CONSISTENTLY PUT THE INTERESTS OF PEOPLE FIRST. THE MEETING </p><p>CONCLUDED WITH A WORKING LUNCH HOSTED BY BISHOP SGRECCIA. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03621  01 OF 02  091519Z </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>MEDIA COVERAGE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.

PRAKASH\'S VISIT WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED BY THE VATICAN, </p><p>HAVING BEEN PREVIOUSLY SANCTIONED BY THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS. PONTIFICAL ACADEMY EXPERT, BISHOP ELIO SGRECCIA, </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION THAT POST HAD FACILITATED A </p><p>SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ENCOUNTER TO FURTHER THE PONTIFICAL </p><p>ACADEMY\'S REFLECTION ON THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY.
