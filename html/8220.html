<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003078 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN ELECTION MISCELLANY: END OF WEEK ONE </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2559-02 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>This cable provides a wrap-up of election-related stories in </p><p>the run-up to Parliamentary elections on June 17. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>TOUJAN FAISAL\'S APPLICATION REJECTED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) At the end of the May 18-20 registration period, 821 </p><p>candidates had registered nationwide for the 110 Lower House </p><p>seats to be contested.  In a move that surprised few, the </p><p>Amman governor and the head of the elections committee </p><p>rejected Toujan Faisal\'s application for participation in the </p><p>Parliamentary elections (see reftel).   The election law </p><p>states that no candidate sentenced to more than a year in </p><p>prison for a non-political crime is eligible to run.  Faisal </p><p>was sentenced by the court to serve one-and-a-half years in </p><p>prison last year for non-political crime.  Even though the </p><p>King eventually pardoned her, her conviction still stands. </p><p>In a public statement, Faisal admitted that she knew she </p><p>would not be granted permission to run, but wanted to force </p><p>the issue publicly.  Faisal has appealed the decision and the </p><p>court is expected to rule within three days. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>MINISTRY OF INTERIOR ACCUSED OF FAVORING CANDIDATES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Minister of Interior denied allegations on Jordan </p><p>television (JTV) that his Ministry provided some candidates </p><p>with constituency lists of their districts.  The constituency </p><p>list would allow the candidates to direct their efforts </p><p>towards the heads or leaders of certain key families or </p><p>tribes.  In a three week campaign period, such lists would </p><p>provide those candidates with an advantage over those who </p><p>rely on door to door campaigning.  Nuha Ma\'aita, a candidate </p><p>in the third district, raised the issue with Poloff on May </p><p>20.  She told Poloff she did not receive a list, but claimed </p><p>at least one candidate in her district had.  She opined that </p><p>since elections themselves would be much more transparent </p><p>this year, the GOJ was stacking the deck before election day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Poloff has heard some anecdotal stories of the GOJ\'s </p><p>tight control of the voter I.D. cards.  One candidate </p><p>reported that after the recent death of her father, she had </p><p>to turn in his voter I.D. card before the government would </p><p>issue a death certificate. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>CANDIDATE PROFILES </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Poloff met with Rashed al-Breisha, a former member of </p><p>parliament running in the first district of Amman.  His major </p><p>campaign slogan is "your brother, Attorney Rashed",  and he </p><p>estimates he needs 4,000 to 5,000 votes to win.  The major </p><p>issues concerning his constituents are unemployment, </p><p>corruption, the recent increase in taxes and prices, </p><p>temporary laws and the current cabinet.  He believes the </p><p>Islamic Action Front (IAF) party will win 18-21 seats in the </p><p>next Parliament.  Al-Breisha is the consummate politician and </p><p>told Poloff, "if my constituents require that I attack my </p><p>father, if that is what it takes to win, I will attack my </p><p>father."  To underscore the point, Rashed explained, he feels </p><p>compelled to attack the Jordanian Government and the U.S. to </p><p>compete with the IAF.  He would have preferred holding </p><p>elections around November to allow anti-government and </p><p>anti-US sentiment to subside. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>BANNERS: CAMPAIGNS FOCUSING ON LOCAL ISSUES </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In a May 22 drive around Amman covering the second, </p><p>third, and fifth election districts, a snapshot of campaign </p><p>banners--the main vehicle of campaign advertising--suggests </p><p>that local issues, not regional issues are the focus of the </p><p>campaign.  Only one in roughly four banners alluded to </p><p>Palestine, including "Jordan and Palestine are twins" and </p><p>"Support the Intifada".  Several banners focused on economic </p><p>issues or the need for better governance.  Examples include: </p><p>"Freedom, education, and democracy"; "No to nepotism"; and </p><p>"No to bureaucracy, no to corruption."  Some banners offered </p><p>a more esoteric message such as: "Hand in hand, we will stay </p><p>together." </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Poloffs saw only two banners attributed to IAF </p><p>candidates, one with Koranic verses and the message that </p><p>"Islam is the solution", and a second that called for "No </p><p>occupation of Iraq"--the only Iraqi-related banner Poloffs </p><p>saw.  By the end of the first week of campaigning, Polfsn </p><p>noted that the number of banners is far less than what was </p><p>seen during the 1997 elections.  Certain areas, such as </p><p>downtown, which was a hub of election-related activity during </p><p>the 1997 elections, had very few banners. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) JTV on May 21 began a program to allow candidates to </p><p>meet with some of their constituents to discuss elections </p><p>issues.  The program allows candidates to introduce </p><p>themselves, present their ideas, and answer questions </p><p>directly from constituents.  So far, the program has covered </p><p>Aqaba and Ma\'an. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
