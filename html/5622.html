<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000676 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/NGA, SA/PAB AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UN, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAEG WELCOMES SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION </p><p>          BUT PUBLIC REACTION MIXED; DERISIVE </p><p>          RITTER SOUNDS OFF IN ABU DHABI </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Abu Dhabi 629 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Thomas </p><p>Williams for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>UAEG PRIVATELY SUPPORTIVE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Initial UAEG reaction to the Secretary\'s presentation </p><p>has been very encouraging. UAE Information Minister Shaykh </p><p>Abdullah Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, who was in London on a private </p><p>visit, contacted the Ambassador in the U.S. to note that the </p><p>facts presented were "credible and convincing."  The </p><p>Secretary\'s inclusion of Saddam\'s human rights abuses at the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>end "completed the package."  Abdullah advised the USG to </p><p>flood the Arabic media in order to underscore the </p><p>Secretary\'s message.  He said the UAEG intended to release a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>public statement supportive of the presentation (see below). </p><p>We separately received positive feedback from Chief of Staff </p><p>Shaykh Muhammad Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (via his Amcit military </p><p>advisor who conveyed points to NEA/ARP Director and </p><p>Polchief).  MbZ (the UAE\'s de facto Defense Minister) </p><p>thought the speech was very powerful and depicted the real </p><p>picture of the Iraqi regime.  He wished that the Secretary </p><p>had not made a connection between Saddam and Palestinian </p><p>"terrorism" and underlined his oft-mentioned concerns that </p><p>the optics of any potential conflict will be key in keeping </p><p>a lid on popular Arab anger. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>SEMI-GOVERNMENTAL PAPER TAKES STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE </p><p>EDITORIAL STANCE.... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The semi-governmental Abu Dhabi-based Arabic </p><p>language daily "Al-Ittihad" (widely viewed as the UAEG\'s </p><p>mouthpiece) on 2/6 issued a strongly supportive editorial, </p><p>placing the onus entirely on Saddam (reftel).  Noting that </p><p>the Secretary had made a very tight case, "Al-Ittihad" </p><p>commented that the presentation highlighted the very real </p><p>limitations of the inspections\' process, particularly in a </p><p>country in which the regime has made an "art of survival." </p><p>As the editorial put it, "The American submission, supported </p><p>by images, phone intercepts, and detailed charts, left no </p><p>room for extending the inspectors\' mission and put extensive </p><p>pressure on the Security Council to take urgent action to </p><p>implement the serious consequences which the UNSC warned of </p><p>if 1441 was violated."  (Note:  In our view, this editorial </p><p>may well be the promised UAEG statement.  Shaykh Abdullah is </p><p>chairman of the board of the "Al-Ittihad" parent company </p><p>Emirates\' Media International and, in that capacity, is able </p><p>to exercise considerable editorial authority.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>...IN STARK CONTRAST TO OTHER, VERY NEGATIVE, REACTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The "Al-Ittihad" stance was not reflected in the </p><p>editorial pages of the UAE\'s other papers.  The 2/7 English- </p><p>language "Gulf News" editorial, titled "Powell found </p><p>wanting," charged that the Secretary\'s "swish" presentation </p><p>had "all of the hallmarks of Hollywood and Steven Spielberg. </p><p>But this was one spiel that did not travel well, probably </p><p>little further than the doors of the Pentagon, the White </p><p>House and 10 Downing Street."  The editorial cast doubt on </p><p>the credibility of the satellite photographs and telephone </p><p>intercepts and noted that "it beggars belief that Iraq, </p><p>known to have sophisticated intelligence systems themselves </p><p>(sic), would not be conscious of the fact that all </p><p>electronically transmitted messages would be liable to </p><p>interception."  The "Gulf News" editorial line was mirrored </p><p>by the Sharjah-based Arabic daily "Al-Khaleej," which has </p><p>traditionally taken a very critical, anti-American stance. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Although he did not comment on the Secretary\'s </p><p>presentation itself, longtime Mission contact and Dubai </p><p>corporate leader Khalaf Al-Habtoor, in a 2/7 "Gulf News" op- </p><p>ed, registered concern over what he described as the USG\'s </p><p>post 9/11 spurning of multilateralism and embrace of the </p><p>"first strike option."  In Al-Habtoor\'s view, the mere </p><p>threat of U.S. military action will be enough to force a </p><p>regime change in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>MIXED PUBLIC REACTION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) While many of our interlocutors were critical of </p><p>the presentation and used it as an opportunity to vent on </p><p>U.S. policy towards the Middle East peace process, others </p><p>took a more nuanced view.  Several expatriates and Emiratis </p><p>-- convinced that war is inevitable -- were alarmed by the </p><p>mostly negative international reaction.  In their view, the </p><p>risks of inaction now solidly outweigh the risks of action. </p><p>Our Iraqi expatriate interlocutors have been the most vocal, </p><p>expressing irritation at the reaction of their fellow Arabs </p><p>and advising us to just ignore the naysayers and get on with </p><p>the job. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>SCOTT RITTER SOUNDS OFF AT THE ARAB LEAGUE\'S ZAYID CENTER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Former UNSCOM inspector Scott Ritter found a largely </p><p>receptive audience during a 2/8 lecture at the Zayid Center </p><p>for Coordination and Follow-Up, an Arab League "research </p><p>center" funded by UAE Deputy Prime Minister Shaykh Sultan </p><p>Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan.  Sultan attended the lecture, in a rare </p><p>public appearance.  Addressing the diplomatic and press </p><p>corps, Ritter predictably derided the Secretary\'s "smoke and </p><p>mirrors" presentation, noting that the U.S., bent on regime </p><p>change, is determined to undermine the inspections\' process. </p><p>Ritter posited that as long as the U.S. focus is on regime </p><p>change, the international community must remain suspicious </p><p>of U.S. policy and all Americans assigned to inspection </p><p>teams in Iraq should be considered intelligence agents.  He </p><p>described U.S. Iraq policy as being part of a grander design </p><p>aimed at regional transformation and took issue with what he </p><p>characterized as our unilateralist approach.  Ritter </p><p>predicted a popular Iraqi uprising against a U.S. occupation </p><p>of Iraq, coupled with broader instability in the region </p><p>which could result in the downfall of some Arab governments. </p><p>Ritter\'s apocalyptic vision, and particularly his brash </p><p>statements on the likely reaction of Iraqis led one Iraqi </p><p>expat, a long-term resident here, to comment skeptically and </p><p>rather indignantly to poloff in an aside "just who does </p><p>Ritter think he is to speak for Iraqis" </p><p> </p><p>WILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
