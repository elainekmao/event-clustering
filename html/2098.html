IN THE LAST WEEK ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE HAVE </p><p>   ARRESTED A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPER VENDORS ON WORKING </p><p>   HARARE\'S STREETS.  POLICE CLAIM THEY ARE ARRESTING </p><p>   PEOPLE FOR "BLOCKING PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES."  A COMMON </p><p>   SIGHT IN THE MORNING RUSH HOUR, NEWSPAPER VENDORS STAND </p><p>   IN THE MIDDLE OF STREETS NEAR MAJOR INTERSECTIONS, </p><p>   DARTING INTO TRAFFIC TO SELL PAPERS TO PASSING </p><p>   COMMUTERS.  OFFICIALS AT THE PRIVATELY OWNED "DAILY </p><p>   NEWS" TELL US THAT THEIR SALES HAVE BEEN HURT BY THE </p><p>   ARRESTS.  EDITORS AND PUBLISHERS OF PRIVATELY OWNED </p><p>   MEDIA SEE THE CRACKDOWN AS PART OF A GOVERNMENT PLAN TO </p><p>   RESTRICT THE DISTRIBUTION OF NEWS, ALTHOUGH OUR </p><p>   ANECDOTAL INFORMATION INDICATES THAT ALL NEWSPAPER </p><p>   VENDORS, NOT JUST THOSE SELLING PRIVATELY OWNED </p><p>   NEWSPAPERS, WERE AFFECTED.  AS OF OCT. 24, MOST VENDORS </p><p>   APPEAR TO HAVE RETREATED TO THE RELATIVE SAFETY OF </p><p>   CURBS AND TRAFFIC ISLANDS. </p><p> </p><p>2.   IN RESPONSE TO THE POLICE EFFORTS TO GET VENDORS </p><p>   OFF THE STREETS, THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" </p><p>   DEDICATED ITS OCTOBER 23 EDITION TO PROTEST AGAINST THE </p><p>   HARASSMENT OF NEWSPAPER VENDORS BY THE POLICE.  UNDER </p><p>   HEADLINE "ZIMBABWE SLOWLY SLIDING INTO AUTHORITARIAN </p><p>   RULE," THE PAPER COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>3.   "THE CRACKDOWN ON NEWSPAPER VENDORS BY THE POLICE </p><p>   IS </p><p>   PART OF A STRATEGY TO ENSURE THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>   MOUTHPIECES, THE ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION </p><p>   (THE SOLE BROADCASTER IN THE COUNTRY) AND ZIMBABWE </p><p>   NEWSPAPERS (PUBLISHERS OF "THE HERALD," THE SUNDAY </p><p>   MAIL," "THE CHRONICLE," AND THREE OTHER TITLES), ARE </p><p>   THE ONLY ONES ZIMBABWEANS WILL LISTEN TO AND READ. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03197  250547Z </p><p>   ONLY THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO REFLECT THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>   REALITY, ACCORDING TO ZANU PF.  EVEN IAN SMITH WAS </p><p>   NOT AS VINDICTIVE AS ZANU PF SOMETIMES SHOWS ITSELF </p><p>   TO BE.  THE SUGGESTION THAT THE POLICE ARE ARRESTING </p><p>   NEWSPAPER VENDORS FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY IS AS BIZARRE </p><p>   AS IT IS ABSURD. . . </p><p> </p><p>   THE PRACTICE ALL OVER THE WORLD IS THAT NEWSPAPER </p><p>   VENDORS SELL THEIR PRODUCTS ON STREET CORNERS. . . </p><p>   THAT VENDORS THREATEN THE SAFETY OF MOTORISTS IS A </p><p>   LIE.  NEWSPAPERS THREATEN THE GOVERNMENT\'S DESIRE TO </p><p>   CLING TO POWER.  THE SELLING OF NEWSPAPERS HAS NOT </p><p>   CREATED A CRISIS ON THE STREETS.  NO ACCIDENTS HAVE </p><p>   BEEN REPORTED. . . </p><p> </p><p>   OBVIOUSLY, THE STRATEGY IS NOT JUST TO DISRUPT THE </p><p>   SALES OF NEWSPAPERS.  IT SEEKS TO LIMIT THE </p><p>   INFLUENCE OF NEWSPAPERS IN INFORMING ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>   ABOUT THE UNFOLDING TRAGEDY IN THEIR COUNTRY.  THIS </p><p>   IS A DECLARATION OF A NEWS BLACKOUT.  . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
