<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003605 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PREL, PHUM, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: ISLAMIST COMMENTATORS TAKE AIM AT EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM John G. Moran, for reasons 1.5 b,d </p><p> </p><p> (C) Summary:  Criticism by Kuwaiti Islamists of the </p><p>US-Kuwait bilateral relationship and of the US Embassy has </p><p>increased significantly over the past weeks.  In a series of </p><p>vitriolic op/eds, a local Islamist (and known al-Qaeda </p><p>sympathizer) has harshly criticized the ambassador and the </p><p>embassy public affairs section for "interfering" in Kuwaiti </p><p>affairs and darkly cautioned the ambassador to keep a low </p><p>profile lest he become a victim of terrorist attack. </p><p>Commentary by another Islamist also falsely accuses the </p><p>Ambassador of inappropriate intervention, while a recently </p><p>elected Islamist member of parliament argues that the US has </p><p>"marginalized" Kuwait\'s role in the reconstruction of </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq.  While Islamist broadsides are nothing new </p><p>in Kuwait, the frequency of these pieces and their ad hominem </p><p>nature has the air of a media campaign.  Also noteworthy has </p><p>been the absence of a strong counter-attack in defense of the </p><p>embassy by Kuwaiti liberals.  While we attribute this largely </p><p>to summer leave and post-war/post-election fatigue, we are </p><p>monitoring this trend and will report as appropriate. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a series of op/eds in leading Kuwaiti Arabic daily </p><p>"Al Rai al-Amm," Islamist commentator and occasional </p><p>al-Jazeera talking head Mohammed al-Awadi has sharply </p><p>criticized Ambassador Jones\' presence at diwaniyas (Kuwaiti </p><p>social events) and accused the ambassador of the "criminal </p><p>project" of seeking Kuwaiti concurrence in a plan to turn </p><p>Mecca and Medina into an "international zone like the </p><p>Vatican": an absurd canard that some credulous Kuwaitis are </p><p>nonetheless likely to accept.  Al-Awadi, who is alleged by </p><p>one PAS contact to have traveled to Afghanistan to meet with </p><p>Osama bin Ladin before September 11, 2001, also cautioned the </p><p>ambassador to lower his profile as "Kuwait cannot afford the </p><p>(political) cost" if the ambassador were to be attacked by </p><p>"someone who lost control" after being angered by the </p><p>Ambassador\'s attempts to influence those opposed to women\'s </p><p>rights.  Post has learned that the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry </p><p>was incensed by al-Awadi\'s veiled threat and considered </p><p>calling him in for questioning, but apparently concluded that </p><p>such a move would only serve to raise his media profile. </p><p>Al-Awadi has since published several other op/eds that among </p><p>other things criticize the embassy public affairs section for </p><p>allegedly attempting to push Islamist students into an </p><p>unwanted dialogue.  In typical fashion, his version of events </p><p>surrounding our Ramadan outreach programs turned the facts on </p><p>their head. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Other Islamists have also written editorials </p><p>criticizing the ambassador and the embassy.  In an op/ed in </p><p>leading Kuwaiti Arabic daily "Al Rai al-Amm," Islamist writer </p><p>Sami Nasser asks rhetorically, "Why is the MFA not doing </p><p>anything about the US ambassador\'s interference and </p><p>undesirable presence in every Diwaniya in Kuwait?"  (Note: </p><p>There has been no change in the ambassador\'s public profile. </p><p>End note.)  In a July 19 interview in local Arabic daily "Al </p><p>Siyassa," Islamist MP Yousef Zalzalleh argues that American </p><p>hubris and interventionist tendencies have led the U.S. to </p><p>"marginalize" Kuwait\'s role in the reconstruction of </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Although it comes as no surprise that Islamists would </p><p>take the offensive once the threat from Saddam was ended, the </p><p>evolving dynamic of Kuwaiti domestic politics might be a </p><p>factor in this sudden late-summer offensive.  While the </p><p>recent Kuwaiti National Assembly elections were widely </p><p>interpreted by Western journalists as a defeat for liberalism </p><p>in Kuwait, the fact remains that the principal Islamist bloc </p><p>in Parliament, the Muslim Brotherhood-sponsored Islamic </p><p>Constitutional Movement (ICM), suffered devastating setbacks, </p><p>losing four of its six seats, including that of its leader. </p><p>While newly elected conservatives filled the void, these new </p><p>members come chiefly from the tribal and Bedouin areas south </p><p>and west of Kuwait City and are not members of the ICM or </p><p>Salafis of the Popular Islamic Grouping, the two best </p><p>organized Islamist political blocs in Kuwait.  In the days </p><p>following the elections, Kuwaiti media reported meetings by </p><p>ICM and Salafi leaders urgently seeking a strategy to </p><p>reconstitute a united Islamist presence in the National </p><p>Assembly.  While it is unclear to what extent their efforts </p><p>will be successful, we conjecture that the ambiguity of the </p><p>elections came as something of a surprise for Islamists in </p><p>Kuwait, and that the current campaign might be related to a </p><p>general strategy to foster unity among widely disparate </p><p>conservative constituencies by rallying them against a </p><p>supposedly common American foe. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) If the current campaign is indeed related to an </p><p>effort by Islamists to recoup lost political capital after </p><p>the elections, they could not have chosen a better time.  A </p><p>plateau period in relations usually follows any great </p><p>bilateral effort in a joint cause, and Kuwait is no exception </p><p>to this rule.  In the period since President Bush announced </p><p>the end of formal hostilities in Iraq, Kuwaitis have begun to </p><p>grumble that they have not received their "fair share" of </p><p>contracts for the rebuilding of Iraq or otherwise have not </p><p>benefited in a manner that proportionately reflects the </p><p>enormous size of their contributions to the war effort. </p><p>(Note: Our reminders to them that their guaranteed continued </p><p>national existence for the foreseeable future should be </p><p>considered a significant benefit has not gained traction, and </p><p>we are currently in the process of putting together a list of </p><p>more tangible benefits that Kuwait has or will accrue as a </p><p>result of OIF. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) There has also been an increase in public concern </p><p>over the fate of Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo.  National </p><p>Assembly Speaker Jassim al-Khorafi recently issued a public </p><p>rebuke of the U.S. on this issue, accusing us of violating </p><p>international law and arguing that Kuwaiti prisoners at </p><p>Guantanamo be either brought to trial immediately or </p><p>released, and his remarks have struck a chord here, forcing </p><p>the FM to issue a statement referencing "secret meetings" </p><p>between Kuwait and the U.S. to urge us to "solve" the </p><p>Guantanamo detention issue out of humanitarian </p><p>considerations.  Reports of alleged mistreatment of Kuwaiti </p><p>students who were returned to Kuwait after being turned away </p><p>at US ports of entry by the INS have also generated </p><p>resentment (Note: Septel report on our consular and public </p><p>affairs sections efforts on this issue is in the works.  End </p><p>note.)  An editorial in the August 3 edition of liberal </p><p>"al-Qabas" expresses anger over U.S. pressure on Gulf </p><p>governments to monitor charities, asking if the U.S. now </p><p>views the feeding of orphans and the needy as a threat to </p><p>national security. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) This critical reportage and commentary has not yet </p><p>elicited the normally spirited counter-attack by liberal </p><p>Kuwaitis, who in the past have usually wasted little time in </p><p>taking on the conservatives.  Only a handful of op/eds from </p><p>well-known stalwarts have stood up for the U.S.  Summer leave </p><p>plans and post-war/post-election fatigue have undoubtedly </p><p>played a part, as well as the calculation that responding to </p><p>somebody like al-Awadi would be counter-productive.  Yet </p><p>there does seem to be something missing in our conversations </p><p>with Kuwaiti liberals these days.  Our PAS section reports </p><p>that meetings with liberal NGO leaders and other progressives </p><p>appear to be marked by a general lassitude and lack of </p><p>interest in US Speakers, American studies initiatives and </p><p>other joint programs.  One women\'s rights leader expanded on </p><p>this, telling us that Kuwaiti liberals excel at denouncing </p><p>Islamist youth programs and other conservative initiatives, </p><p>but never manage to translate their indignation into action </p><p>by putting together programs of their own. Again, this is </p><p>clearly at least in part the result of collective burnout </p><p>after a year that has seen terrorist attacks, Iraqi missile </p><p>launches and governmental inaction and gridlock, but this </p><p>lack of progressive dynamism, when contrasted with the energy </p><p>with which Islamists are framing issues in Kuwaiti society, </p><p>is a source of concern. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) At this point we would agree with our friends at the </p><p>MOI that a direct response to obvious fictions by the embassy </p><p>would only serve to raise the profile of Islamist windbags </p><p>like al-Awadi.  Our strategy so far has involved media </p><p>interviews with Ambassador Jones and embassy officers </p><p>(al-Qabas published last week a two-page interview with the </p><p>Ambassador in which he addressed the economic benefits for </p><p>Kuwait from OIF, visa issues, the Guantanamo detainees and </p><p>other high profile issues), op-eds, receptions for students </p><p>and our continued presence on the Diwaniyah circuit.  We are </p><p>looking to MEPI programs for help with high-profile youth </p><p>exchanges, essay contests and support for programs focusing </p><p>on women\'s political empowerment in Kuwait.  Over time we </p><p>will see the Kuwaitis playing a more active, successful role </p><p>in Iraqi reconstruction, and we will look at ways to </p><p>publicize US/Kuwaiti cooperation.  These initiatives should </p><p>help to remind Kuwaitis of the depth of the bilateral </p><p>relationship and will hopefully put the histrionics of </p><p>conservatives seeking to drive a wedge between the U.S. and </p><p>Kuwait into perspective.  However, we should continue to </p><p>monitor the situation and not hesitate to take more active </p><p>measures if circumstances warrant. </p><p> </p><p>Jones </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
