Radikal: Jandarma Master Sergeant Ilhan </p><p>Kayikci and Private Salih Sancar were arrested </p><p>for killing Cetin Kahraman by gunfire on the </p><p>grounds that Kahraman disobeyed a "halt warning" </p><p>while driving from Baskale to Van the previous </p><p>morning. Seven people had already been detained </p><p>for attacking the police with stones and clubs as </p><p>the police took Kahraman\'s body from the </p><p>hospital; they were released by the court on the </p><p>condition that they voluntarily appear before the </p><p>court when needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.

Two Turkish </p><p>Parliamentarians accompanied the humanitarian </p><p>relief convoy. The Turkish Foreign Ministry (FM) </p><p>announced hundreds of trucks carrying </p><p>humanitarian relief goods had already been moved </p><p>to Iraq. The FM also announced aircraft and </p><p>health teams would be dispatched from Turkey to </p><p>Iraq for the treatment of some wounded persons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.

She said she was visiting </p><p>the region as someone in charge of the </p><p>humanitarian relief program. She also received </p><p>information regarding Iraq from the UN officials. </p><p>During her meeting with Diyarbakir\'s governor, </p><p>Roth expressed that she was happy because the </p><p>wave of migration everybody had feared did not </p><p>happen, and there is a calm situation in northern </p><p>Iraq. She also told the governor that </p><p>broadcasting in the mother tongue, particularly </p><p>in Kurdish, should be allowed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Evrensel: On March 1, Zamanhan Kaya, Mehmet </p><p>Bakis, Bilal Yakis, and Suat Kucuk went to </p><p>Nusaybin in Mardin to sell detergents.

Later, the court released </p><p>them but they were never heard from again after </p><p>they were set free. Kaya\'s father claimed he </p><p>received a letter 15 days ago, undersigned by an </p><p>Ibrahim, stating his son and his three friends </p><p>were under arrest in Nusaybin and would be </p><p>released shortly. Kaya\'s father feared his son </p><p>and the others would be kidnapped, and therefore </p><p>applied to Diyarbakir State Security Court (SSC) </p><p>and Diyarbakir HRA to help find out whereabouts </p><p>of his son and his friends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.

He said many people </p><p>were disabled by the explosion of land mines </p><p>while going out for a walk or walking from one </p><p>village to another. Calli also stated the area </p><p>must be cleared of land mines so people could </p><p>return to their villages. </p><p>7.  Evrensel: On May 1, the Turkish Labor Day, </p><p>meetings will be held between the political </p><p>parties and labor unions in almost every town. In </p><p>Adana, the meeting will start at 11:00 a.m. at </p><p>Mimiar Sinan Open Air Theater and continue with a </p><p>march to the Ugur Mumcu Square by the railway </p><p>station. In Van, after a long absence, the </p><p>festivities will be held for the first time. The </p><p>May 1 meeting will also be held in Diyarbakir, </p><p>Malatya, Mardin, Tunceli, Mersin, Gaziantep, </p><p>Adiyaman, Batman, Elazig, and Sanliurfa provinces </p><p>in Adana\'s consular district. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.

Keskin said, </p><p>despite all precautions, mouth-and-foot disease </p><p>was determined in five quarters of Seyhan and </p><p>Yuregir districts because of unregistered </p><p>livestock and the unauthorized movement of </p><p>livestock. Pursuant to this issue, the Director </p><p>of Provincial Animal Health Section, Enver Ozbek, </p><p>said, they launched an inoculation campaign that </p><p>began on March 01 and would last until May 15. </p><p>They have already given shots to 56,804 animals </p><p>in the province. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
