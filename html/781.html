<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEL AVIV 016873 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SMEC AND NEA/IAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  10/23/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, KPAL, KWBG, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  HAMAS JAILBREAK:  YOU CAN HIDE, BUT YOU CAN\'T RUN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  THREE HAMAS ACTIVISTS ESCAPED FROM THE MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE WING OF GAZA CENTRAL PRISON OCTOBER 22.  TWO OF </p><p>THEM, YUSEF MALAHI AND OSAMA ABU TAHA, HAD BEEN IMPLICATED IN </p><p>LETHAL ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS AND HAD BEEN SENTENCED TO 12 YEAR </p><p>SENTENCES BY THE PALESTINIAN SECURITY COURT.  THE THIRD, IMAD </p><p>AQIL, HAD BEEN ARRESTED WHILE ATTEMPTING TO CARRY OUT A SUICIDE </p><p>ATTACK AGAINST AN ISRAELI SETTLEMENT IN GAZA.  AQIL TURNED </p><p>HIMSELF INTO POLICE A LITTLE OVER 24 HOURS AFTER THE ESCAPE. </p><p> </p><p>NOWHERE TO RUN </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) ATTORNEY GENERAL KHALID AL </p><p>QIDRAH TOLD POLOFF OCTOBER 23, (EVEN BEFORE AQIL TURNED HIMSELF </p><p>IN) THAT A SEARCH AND INVESTIGATION WERE UNDERWAY AND HE DID NOT </p><p>EXPECT THE TWO REMAINING ESCAPEES TO REMAIN AT LARGE FOR LONG. </p><p>"GAZA IS SMALL AND THEY ARE WELL-KNOWN."  GAZA REUTERS CHIEF </p><p>TAHER SHRITEH, WHO MAINTAINS CONTACTS WITH HAMAS MEMBERS, </p><p>DISAGREED WITH AL QIDRAH ABOUT WHETHER ABU TAHA AND MALAHI COULD </p><p>REMAIN AT LARGE FOR LONG.  CITING WANTED PALESTINIANS\' ABILITY TO </p><p>AVOID CAPTURE UNDER ISRAELI RULE, HE ADDED THAT EVEN TRAPPED IN </p><p>GAZA, UNLESS THE TWO TURNED THEMSELVES IN, THE SEARCH COULD BE </p><p>LENGTHY.  BOTH AL QIDRAH AND SHRITEH SAID THEY BELIEVED THAT SOME </p><p>OF THE GUARDS WERE PROBABLY SYMPATHETIC TO HAMAS AND HELPED IN </p><p>THE ESCAPE.  LOCAL MEDIA REPORTED THAT FIVE PA MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO THE </p><p>ESCAPE. </p><p> </p><p>GOI KEEPS AN OPEN MIND, BUT WARY OF PA/HAMAS INTENTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ARAB AFFAIRS ADVISOR SHALOM HARARI (PROTECT) TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT THE GOI HAD NO "PROOF" THAT THERE WAS PA COLLUSION IN THE </p><p>ESCAPE, OR EVEN THAT SENIOR OFFICIALS IN HAMAS SUPPORTED THE </p><p>ESCAPE.  HE SAID THE GOI WOULD WATCH TO SEE HOW THE INCIDENT </p><p>PLAYED OUT, BUT THE FACT WAS THAT SUCH THINGS HAPPEN.  HE </p><p>RECALLED A 1987 PRISON BREAK BY FOUR ISLAMIC JIHAD TERRORISTS WHO </p><p>ESCAPED FROM AN ISRAELI PRISON INSIDE GAZA.  "THEY JUMPED OVER </p><p>TWO FENCES AFTER GETTING OUT OF THE PRISON!  IT HAPPENS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ACCORDING TO HARARI, THE GOI REMAINS SUSPICIOUS BECAUSE </p><p>ARAFAT IS AT SUCH A DELICATE POINT IN HIS NEGOTIATIONS.  THE </p><p>CLOSURE ON GAZA WILL CONTINUE TO BE TIGHT BECAUSE ARAFAT HAS NOT </p><p>REACHED FINAL AGREEMENT WITH HAMAS.  "THEY HAVE NOT DECIDED TO </p><p>END ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS."  ARAFAT IS MAINTAINING AN </p><p>"EXTREMELY COMPLEX BALANCING ACT" AND THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR </p><p>HIM TO MISCALCULATE.  ON THE ONE HAND HE HAS THE GOI, THE USG AND </p><p>PALESTINIAN PUBLIC OPINION WHICH NO LONGER SUPPORTS THE SUICIDE </p><p>ATTACKS, AND ON THE OTHER THE STRATEGIC NEGOTIATIONS WITH HAMAS. </p><p>FOR THESE NEGOTIATIONS HE MUST LOOSEN AS WELL AS TIGHTEN THE </p><p>NOOSE AROUND HAMAS.  A MISTAKE ON THE STRENGTH OF THE NOOSE COULD </p><p>LET AN ATTACK SLIP THROUGH. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  HARARI WAS SURPRISINGLY CHARITABLE IN DESCRIBING ARAFAT\'S </p><p>NEED TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN TOUGHNESS AND FLEXIBILITY IN HIS </p><p>DEALINGS WITH HAMAS.  THE DOMINANT AND AUTHORITATIVE ISRAELI </p><p>POSITION AT THIS TIME, VOICED BY RABIN AND OTHERS IN THE POLICY </p><p>LOOP, IS THAT ARAFAT\'S SECURITY EFFORTS HAVE SLACKENED IN RECENT </p><p>WEEKS AND THAT HE MUST DO BETTER IF HE WANTS THE CLOSURE LIFTED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INDYK </p><p></p></div>
