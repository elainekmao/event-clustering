<p>UNCLAS RIYADH 002627 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01: SAUDI REACTION TO SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: RIYADH 2620 </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL SAG REACTION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  ON THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 11, THE SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNMENT ISSUED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT (UNOFFICIAL </p><p>TRANSLATION): </p><p> </p><p>THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA EXPRESSES ITS CONDEMNATION </p><p>OF THE REGRETTABLE AND INHUMAN EXPLOSIONS AND ATTACKS </p><p>WHICH OCCURRED AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK </p><p>AND THE PENTAGON IN WASHINGTON IN THE U.S.A.  THE </p><p>KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA STRONGLY CONDEMNS ACTS SUCH AS </p><p>THESE WHICH ARE IN CONFLICT WITH ALL RELIGIOUS VALUES </p><p>AND SOCIAL AND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.  THE KINGDOM </p><p>OFFERS ITS SINCERE CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF THE </p><p>VICTIMS, TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, AND TO THE </p><p>AMERICAN PEOPLE.  THE KINGDOM REITERATES ITS </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM AND WILL CONTINUE TO ACT </p><p>ALONG WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COMBAT </p><p>TERRORISM IN ALL OF ITS FORMS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SAUDI MEDIA COVERAGE WILL BE REPORTED SEPTEL, BUT </p><p>THE STORY DOMINATES WITH A SOMBER EDITORIAL TONE </p><p>EXPRESSING SHOCK, GLOOM, SADNESS AND DEPRESSION. </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC REACTION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  MOVING ABOUT RIYADH ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER 11, </p><p>POLOFF OBSERVED A BEEFED-UP SAG SECURITY PRESENCE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AROUND THE DIPLOMATIC QUARTER.  LOCAL </p><p>STORES WERE BUSY, THOUGH FEW WESTERN EXPATS WERE </p><p>SHOPPING.  POLOFF HAD SEVERAL CHANCE ENCOUNTERS WITH </p><p>SAUDIS AND NON-WESTERN EXPATS, ALL OF WHOM EXPRESSED </p><p>CONDOLENCES AND OFFERED SYMPATHY.  AN ENCOUNTER </p><p>OUTSIDE OF A LARGE SHOPPING MALL WAS REPRESENTATIVE. </p><p>A GROUP OF FOUR THIRTY-ISH SAUDI MALES EXPRESSED </p><p>CONDOLENCES, THEN ONE COMMENTED THAT HE WAS CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, ESPECIALLY REGARDING WHAT </p><p>HE FELT WOULD BE AN INEVITABLE BACKLASH AGAINST ARABS </p><p>AND MUSLIMS.  ANOTHER SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF ACTION </p><p>WAS UNCALLED FOR IN ANY SITUATION AND ASSERTED THAT </p><p>"TRUE MUSLIMS" WOULD NOT HESITATE IN CONDEMNING THE </p><p>ACTION.  STILL, THEY SAID, THE ONGOING INTIFADA IN THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES HAD CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF </p><p>RANCOR TOWARDS THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.  THEY IMPLIED </p><p>THAT THE U.S. SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED A RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>GROWING TENSION GIVEN ALL THE WARNINGS SENT FROM THE </p><p>ARAB WORLD ABOUT THE DETERIORATING SITUATION.  WHILE </p><p>IN NO WAY JUSTIFYING THE ATTACKS OR SHOWING ANY </p><p>SATISFACTION, THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR: "WE TOLD YOU SO." </p><p> </p><p>4.  SHORTLY AFTER NEWS OF THE ATTACKS WAS BROADCAST ON </p><p>LOCAL MEDIA, AN AMCIT EXECUTIVE AT A LARGE SAUDI </p><p>COMPANY REPORTED THAT HIS SAUDI COLLEAGUES AND </p><p>SUBORDINATES REACTED WITH MIXED EMOTIONS: SOME </p><p>EXPRESSED SHOCK AND SYMPATHY, OTHERS REACTED WITH </p><p>GRATIFICATION THAT "AMERICA IS FEELING PAIN," WHILE </p><p>STILL OTHERS VOICED CONCERN THAT THE INCIDENTS MIGHT </p><p>SOMEHOW INTERFERE WITH THE U.S. VISA ISSUANCE PROCESS </p><p>AND THEIR FUTURE TRAVEL TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ANOTHER CONTACT WHO HAS BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING </p><p>PAN-ARAB SATELLITE VERNACULAR NEWS COVERAGE AND </p><p>ARABIC-LANGUAGE INTERNET MESSAGE BOARDS STATED THAT </p><p>SAUDIS AND OTHER ARABS ARE GINNING UP NUMEROUS </p><p>CONSPIRACY THEORIES WHICH ATTRIBUTE RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>THE ATTACKS TO VIRTUALLY EVERYONE EXCEPT ARABS (MOSSAD </p><p>AGENTS, MILOSEVIC-SUPPORTING YUGOSLAVS, AND UNDERLINGS </p><p>OF A RECENTLY-EXTRADITED COLOMBIAN DRUG LORD ARE THE </p><p>PRIME SUSPECTS).  A NUMBER OF APPARENTLY INACCURATE </p><p>REPORTS (E.G. EXPLOSION AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, </p><p>DELIBERATE USG SHOOT-DOWN OF AIRLINER NEAR PITTSBURGH, </p><p>ATTACK ON CAMP DAVID) REMAIN IN CIRCULATION.  FEARS OF </p><p>AN ANTI-ARAB/ANTI-MUSLIM BACKLASH IN THE U.S. APPEAR </p><p>WIDESPREAD. </p><p> </p><p>6.  EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS AND </p><p>E-MAIL MESSAGES FROM SAUDI, WESTERN, AND DIPLOMATIC </p><p>COLLEAGUES EXPRESSING SHOCK AND HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES. </p><p> </p><p>SCOBEY </p><p></p></div>
