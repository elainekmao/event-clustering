<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002365 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS-MANIGAULT </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZIER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/09/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: A ZAMBIAN TAKE ON ZIMBABWE SITUATION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM ROBERT E. WHITEHEAD FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  DCM PAID A COURTESY CALL ON ZAMBIAN </p><p>COUNTERPART BEN SHAWA ON AUGUST 9.  THE EXCHANGE WAS </p><p>SURPRISINGLY FRANK AND PRODUCTIVE, WITH SHAWA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02365  01 OF 02  091356Z </p><p>PROVIDING HIS TAKE ON ELECTION PROSPECTS, SADC </p><p>ELECTORAL MONITORING, NDEBELE RUMBLINGS, ZDERA, AND </p><p>THE IMPACT OF EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE ON ZAMBIA.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>FREE AND FAIR NOT IN THE CARDS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SHAWA EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT FREE AND FAIR </p><p>2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  HE </p><p>PREDICTED WIDESPREAD GOZ-SPONSORED VIOLENCE IN AN </p><p>ATTEMPT TO INTIMIDATE WOULD-BE MDC VOTERS INTO EITHER </p><p>VOTING ZANU-PF OR STAYING AWAY FROM THE POLLS </p><p>ALTOGETHER.  THE MUGABE STRATEGY, HE CONTINUED, WAS TO </p><p>ENGINEER AN ELECTORAL VICTORY, AT WHICH TIME HE </p><p>PLANNED TO REIN IN THE WAR VETERANS AND LAUNCH A CHARM </p><p>OFFENSIVE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE TO REHABILITATE </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S IMAGE AND IMPROVE ITS PROSPECTS FOR RENEWED </p><p>ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE.  SHAWA DOUBTED THAT MUGABE COULD </p><p>ACHIEVE THE LATTER AND WAS EQUALLY DUBIOUS ON THE </p><p>SECOND POINT.  HE CONCLUDED THAT THE PERCEPTION OF A </p><p>STOLEN ELECTION RISKED SPARKING SERIOUS OUTBREAKS IN </p><p>URBAN AREAS, WHERE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE </p><p>TO LOSE AND ACTUALLY WELCOME FACE-OFFS WITH SECURITY </p><p>FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>TOOTHLESS SADC ELECTION MONITORS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02365  01 OF 02  091356Z </p><p>3.  (C) DCM ASKED IF SADC WOULD MOUNT AN ELECTION </p><p>MONITORING EXERCISE AS IT HAD DONE FOR PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  SHAWA CONFIRMED THAT THIS WOULD CERTAINLY </p><p>HAPPEN, ALTHOUGH NO PLAN HAD YET BEEN FINALIZED.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT THE GRZ WOULD PUSH FOR THIS OUTCOME, SINCE </p><p>IT FAVORED THE "SOFT, TOOTHLESS" APPROACH OF SADC, A </p><p>LA MBEKI, RATHER THAN MORE RIGOROUS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SCRUTINY.  HE PREDICTED THAT THE GOZ WOULD ORGANIZE A </p><p>DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE TO ENSURE THAT OTHER SADC STATES </p><p>STAYED IN LINE.  HE NOTED THAT THE MDC\'S ATTEMPT TO </p><p>ARRANGE TOP-LEVEL MEETINGS FOR TSVANGIRAI IN SADC </p><p>CAPITALS HAD PROMPTED THE DISPATCH OF GOZ TEAMS TO </p><p>PRESSURE WOULD-BE HOSTS ON THIS POINT.  A NUMBER OF </p><p>SADC COUNTRIES HAD SUBSEQUENTLY DUCKED THE MEETINGS. </p><p>IN ZAMBIA, TSVANGIRAI HAD BEEN SHUNTED OFF TO MMD </p><p>HATCHET MAN MICHAEL SATA, WHOM SHAWA (PROTECT) TERMED </p><p>"OUR (ZAMBIA\'S) OWN WAR VET." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL NDEBELE DISCONTENT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SHAWA SAID THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RIFTS AT </p><p>THE TOP OF ZANU-PF, AND THAT ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CLEAVAGES RUNS ALONG ETHNIC LINES.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED A RECENT APPROACH BY MEMBERS OF THE KAFELA </p><p>TRUST, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS AN NDEBELE FOUNDATION. </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA, HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER NKOMO, AND </p><p>MINISTER MOYO (HE DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH ONE) </p><p>APPROACHED THE ZAMBIAN HIGH COMMISSION WITH A REQUEST </p><p>TO SEND ARCHIVISTS AND CAMERAMEN TO ZAMBIA TO SEARCH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02365  01 OF 02  091356Z </p><p>FREEDOM HOUSE AND MILITARY ARCHIVES FOR DOCUMENTS </p><p>CHRONICLING ZIPRA\'S ROLE IN THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE. </p><p>THEY COMPLAINED THAT OFFICIAL GOZ CHRONICLES OF THE </p><p>WAR EMPHASIZED THE CENTRAL ZANLA ROLE AND RELEGATED </p><p>ZIPRA TO THE FOOTNOTES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SHAWA SAID THAT THE UNITY AGREEMENT WAS SHAKY </p><p>AND POSITED THAT THE KAFELA TRUST INITIATIVE MIGHT BE </p><p>A HARBINGER OF A MOVEMENT TO RECREATE A ZAPU </p><p>ORGANIZATION AS OPPOSED TO THE ZAPU 2000 PARTY FORMED </p><p>BEFORE THE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, THAT FAILED TO </p><p>GARNER WIDESPREAD SUPPORT IN MATEBELELAND.  THE </p><p>ZAMBIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER REQUESTED THAT THEY PUT </p><p>THEIR REQUEST THROUGH OFFICIAL GOZ CHANNELS, TO AVOID </p><p>ACCUSATIONS AFTER THE FACT THAT THE GRZ WAS PLAYING A </p><p>DOUBLE GAME.  SHAWA ADDED IRONICALLY THAT WHATEVER THE </p><p>OUTCOME OF THE INITIATIVE, THE GRZ WOULD ENSURE THAT </p><p>NO ONE FROM A KAFELA TRUST DELEGATION WENT TO </p><p>BAROTSELAND. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3286 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02365  02 OF 02  091357Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------0FC844  091357Z /38 </p><p>O 091357Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9437 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002365 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS-MANIGAULT </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZIER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/09/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: A ZAMBIAN TAKE ON ZIMBABWE SITUATION </p><p> </p><p>ZDERA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DCM NOTED BROAD LOCAL PRESS COVERAGE OF SENATE </p><p>PASSAGE OF ZDERA AND ASKED SHAWA WHAT HIS ZAMBIAN </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS WERE SAYING ABOUT THE BILL.  SHAWA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02365  02 OF 02  091357Z </p><p>REPLIED THAT THE OVERWHELMING SENTIMENT AMONG THE </p><p>LITERATE CLASS WAS THAT IF ZDERA HASTENED MUGABE\'S </p><p>DEPARTURE FROM THE SCENE, THEN THEY WERE FOR IT. </p><p>ZANU-PF PROPAGANDA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE WITH THE LESS </p><p>EDUCATED, HOWEVER, MANY OF WHOM TAKE AT FACE VALUE </p><p>CLAIMS THAT THE LEGISLATION IS PART OF AN MDC PLOT TO </p><p>ISOLATE AND IMPOVERISH THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ZAMBIA KEEPS ITS HEAD IN THE SAND </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) DCM QUERIED SHAWA ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON ZAMBIA </p><p>OF THE GROWING CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE.  SHAWA OBSERVED </p><p>THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CONCERN IN LUSAKA THAT THE </p><p>UNREST WOULD CROSS THE BORDER.  LAND IS NOT AN ISSUE </p><p>IN ZAMBIA, RACIAL/ETHNIC CLEAVAGES RUN LESS DEEP, AND </p><p>THE WAR VETERAN PHENOMENON IS NON-EXISTENT.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN SOUTH AFRICA, WHERE THERE </p><p>IS FERTILE SOIL FOR SIMILAR UNREST.  DCM POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT WHILE ZAMBIA MAY NOT BE POLITICALLY VULNERABLE TO </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE DISEASE, IT IS NOT IMMUNE TO AN ECONOMIC </p><p>DOWNTURN IN A MAJOR TRADING PARTNER, POSSIBLE </p><p>INTERRUPTION OF VITAL TRANSPORTATION LINKS, OR EVEN </p><p>POTENTIAL REFUGEE FLOWS.  SHAWA REPEATED THAT THE GRZ </p><p>IS NOT DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE </p><p>CRISIS, INCLUDING REFUGEE FLOWS.  CLEAR-THINKING </p><p>REFUGEES WOULD HEAD SOUTH, NOT NORTH. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02365  02 OF 02  091357Z </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THERE WAS NOT MUCH SURPRISING HERE OTHER THAN </p><p>EX-ZIPRA MEMBERS LOOKING TO SET THE HISTORICAL RECORD </p><p>STRAIGHT.  WE CANNOT COMMENT ON SHAWA\'S "ZAPU REBORN" </p><p>THEORY, ALTHOUGH IT IS WORTH CONSIDERING THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT NDEBELE MEMBERS OF ZANU-PF MIGHT BE </p><p>EXAMINING THEIR OPTIONS.  SHAWA\'S COMMENTS ON THE SADC </p><p>ELECTION MONITORING MECHANISM WERE NOT ENCOURAGING. </p><p>CONCERTED EFFORT IN ALL SADC CAPITALS TO COUNTER GOZ </p><p>PRESSURE MAY BE ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT A SADC MONITORING </p><p>EXERCISE FROM BECOMING A ZANU-PF RUBBER STAMP. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
