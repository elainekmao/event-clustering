(SBU) SUMMARY: In a July 17 meeting with Minister of </p><p>Trade Truong Dinh Tuyen, the Ambassador noted that GVN </p><p>efforts to raise auto tariffs, impose tariff-rate quotas </p><p>(TRQs) on a number of agricultural products, and reorganize </p><p>the agencies responsible for protection of intellectual </p><p>property rights have created doubts regarding the Government </p><p>of Vietnam\'s (GVN) commitment to acceding to the WTO by </p><p>2005.  The Minister reiterated his interest in meeting with </p><p>USTR Zoellick and DOC Secretary Evans during his trip to the </p><p>U.S. in September, sought U.S. support for Vietnam\'s </p><p>continued participation in the Oil for Food program, and </p><p>complained about the Vietnam Human Rights act. At the </p><p>conclusion of the meeting, Ambassador and Minister Tuyen </p><p>signed the bilateral textile agreement.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>VISIT TO THE U.S. </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) At the invitation of the Chicago Council on Foreign </p><p>Relations, Minister Tuyen plans to travel to the U.S. in </p><p>September to attend the "Chicago Conference on the Global </p><p>Economy."  Minister Tuyen told Ambassador that the </p><p>conference alone is not a sufficient reason for the Prime </p><p>Minister to approve his trip to the U.S. and asked the </p><p>Ambassador to support his requests for meetings with USTR </p><p>Zoellick and DOC Secretary Evans.  Ambassador commented that </p><p>the conference presented a good opportunity for travel to </p><p>the U.S., told Minister Tuyen that Ambassador Zoellick had </p><p>already agreed to meet with him (tentatively on September </p><p>18), and assured the Minister that he would continue to </p><p>support efforts to arrange the meeting with Secretary Evans. </p><p>Ambassador also urged Minister Tuyen to coordinate plans for </p><p>his trip with the other Cabinet ministers (i.e. the </p><p>Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Planning and Investment, and </p><p>Defense), all of whom will also be traveling to the U.S. in </p><p>the fall. </p><p> </p><p>OIL FOR FOOD </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Minister Tuyen told the Ambassador that Vietnam is </p><p>still awaiting instructions from U.N. Committee 661 on </p><p>exporting goods to Iraq under the Oil for Food program and </p><p>asked for U.S. support within this Committee.  In addition </p><p>to priority goods, the Minister noted, the GVN is also </p><p>hoping for approval of contracts for export of tea to Iraq. </p><p>Tea cultivation is part of a poverty reduction program in </p><p>Vietnam and the exports to Iraq are a critical component of </p><p>that program, the Minister added.  After noting that </p><p>Vietnam\'s past position on Iraq has not been helpful, </p><p>Ambassador described the current procedure in place for </p><p>approving contracts.  Given the kinds of products Vietnam </p><p>wishes to export, the Ambassador noted, most of Vietnam\'s </p><p>contracts should get priority, and some individual contracts </p><p>may already have been approved.  The Ambassador advised the </p><p>Minister to have Vietnam\'s mission to the U.N. contact the </p><p>U.N. Office of Iraq Programs.  Minister Tuyen provided </p><p>Ambassador with a copy of a letter MOT sent the Office of </p><p>Iraq Programs in the U.N.  (Note:  A copy of the letter has </p><p>been faxed to EAP/BCLTV.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>VHRA </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Minister Tuyen expressed his objections to the </p><p>passage of the VHRA amendment to the State Department </p><p>Authorization bill by the U.S. House of Representatives. </p><p>The Minister noted that, while this topic is not one that a </p><p>Trade Minister would normally raise, he felt a need to </p><p>express his views on the issue as a Communist Party of </p><p>Vietnam Central Committee member.  Minister Tuyen advised </p><p>Ambassador that if the VHRA is approved, there will be a </p><p>very negative impact on the bilateral relationship, "even in </p><p>areas of particular interest to the U.S."  He also said he </p><p>believed that forces exist in the U.S. that oppose the </p><p>further development of the bilateral relationship. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Ambassador responded by highlighting the connection </p><p>between human rights and Vietnam\'s investment climate.  When </p><p>investors see that the legal system is biased and people can </p><p>be thrown in jail for expressing their opinions, they </p><p>consider investment to be risky, he said.  Foreign investors </p><p>want an independent legal system that is not controlled by </p><p>one political party.  They also want access to the Internet </p><p>unimpeded by firewalls, legislation governing content, or </p><p>police screening email.  Vietnam cannot separate human </p><p>rights and economic issues, the Ambassador advised. </p><p> </p><p>WTO ACCESSION </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Ambassador told Minister Tuyen that some recent </p><p>GVN decisions have caused him to question Vietnam\'s </p><p>commitment to accede to the WTO in 2005.  First, the </p><p>imposition of TRQs on certain agricultural products that </p><p>have not been subject to quota is a step in the wrong </p><p>direction, he said.  Before Vietnam enters the WTO, it will </p><p>have to eliminate the TRQs.  The GVN\'s imposition of TRQs </p><p>creates a new obstacle that must be negotiated away. </p><p>Second, raising auto tariffs is another step backward. </p><p>Normally, as countries prepare to accede to the WTO, they </p><p>lower tariffs.  Harmonization should result in decreasing, </p><p>not increasing, tariff rates.  Additionally, the Ambassador </p><p>pointed out that efforts to force companies to have greater </p><p>local content are also counter to WTO principles.  (Ref A </p><p>includes Ambassador\'s discussion of these issues with the </p><p>Ministry of Finance.)  Finally, the Ambassador noted that </p><p>the recent reorganization of agencies administering </p><p>intellectual property rights (IPR) (ref B) could make it </p><p>more difficult for Vietnam to enforce IPR than before.  The </p><p>GVN has taken half of the National Office of Intellectual </p><p>Property\'s (NOIP) portfolio and moved it to MOT, despite the </p><p>significant investment donors have made in enhancing NOIP\'s </p><p>capacity.  The Ambassador asked how effectively Vietnam will </p><p>be able to handle trademark registration now. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Minister Tuyen affirmed that the GVN has </p><p>comprehensively reviewed its position on WTO accession and </p><p>wants to accelerate the process.  There is a "strong </p><p>determination from other agencies and me" to make progress, </p><p>the Minister asserted.  However, even in that context, it </p><p>should be noted that non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and TRQs </p><p>need to be addressed appropriately.  The BTA includes NTBs, </p><p>and other countries continue to use them.  With respect to </p><p>TRQs, the Minister noted that China was allowed to retain a </p><p>TRQ on soybeans.  Vietnam is in a better position than </p><p>China, as the GVN does not use quantitative restrictions and </p><p>imposed the TRQs only as a transition measure.  In response </p><p>to the Ambassador\'s question regarding how long the TRQs </p><p>would be in place, Minister Tuyen responded that the GVN </p><p>would make this decision "within the context of WTO </p><p>negotiations." </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Regarding auto tariffs, the Minister asserted that </p><p>the foreign-invested companies need to think long-term. </p><p>While the tariffs may cause the companies some short-term </p><p>harm, the tariffs will benefit both the companies and </p><p>Vietnam\'s growth and development in the long run.  The </p><p>imposition of higher auto tariffs was not designed to </p><p>protect domestic producers, the Minister argued.  No </p><p>domestic manufacturer can produce enough spare parts to </p><p>satisfy demand.  The only players in the market are the </p><p>foreign-invested companies, and the policy was designed for </p><p>them.  With respect to Ford in particular, the Minister </p><p>argued that if Ford invests more in Vietnam, it will find </p><p>good conditions for its investment.  The only real problem </p><p>Ford (and the other auto manufacturers) face is the small </p><p>scale of Vietnam\'s internal market.  In response to </p><p>Ambassador\'s remark that parts manufactured in ASEAN </p><p>countries will face lower tariffs, thereby benefiting auto </p><p>parts producers in Thailand and elsewhere, the Minister </p><p>simply responded that the GVN would need to have a final </p><p>review of the policy. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) On the reorganization of IPR agencies, Minister </p><p>Tuyen noted that it was Vietnam\'s earlier centrally planned </p><p>economic hierarchy that had decided to give responsibility </p><p>for IPR to the Ministry of Science and Technology rather </p><p>than to the Ministries of Trade or Industry, which is the </p><p>norm in most countries.  Because MOT already has the Market </p><p>Management Police who are responsible for investigating </p><p>counterfeit goods in the marketplace, it will be "more </p><p>reasonable and more effective" to have trademarks under MOT. </p><p>Minister Tuyen added that it would have made more sense to </p><p>move all of NOIP\'s responsibilities (trademarks and patents) </p><p>to MOT, but he was "not a complete winner."  (Note: NOIP </p><p>retained control over patents.  End note.)  The Ambassador </p><p>noted that he hoped to see more crackdowns under MOT </p><p>leadership and suggested that the two sides revisit the </p><p>issue in six months to see if IPR enforcement had improved. </p><p> </p><p>TEXTILE SIGNING </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) At the end of the meeting, Ambassador and Minister </p><p>Tuyen signed the bilateral textile agreement that had been </p><p>initialed in Washington in April.  The original signed </p><p>agreement has been pouched to EAP/BCLTV. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) COMMENT: Despite Minister Tuyen\'s assurances to </p><p>the contrary, the commitment of officials at the highest </p><p>levels of the government and the party to making the hard </p><p>decisions necessary to move Vietnam\'s WTO accession forward </p><p>remains unclear.  Minister Tuyen, like all the other GVN </p><p>officials with whom we have raised the auto tariff and TRQ </p><p>issues, artfully ignored the strong link the Ambassador drew </p><p>between the GVN\'s backward policies and (lack of) progress </p><p>on WTO accession.  We will continue to raise these issues </p><p>with the GVN.  On IPR, we will hold Minister Tuyen to his </p><p>pledge that MOT will now do a better job of clearing </p><p>counterfeit goods from the marketplace.   We will not, </p><p>however, be holding our breath. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
