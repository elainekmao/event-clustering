<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001929 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 22 (4/01 1200 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) FBIS GMP20030331000233 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) FBIS GMP200303331000231 </p><p>     C. (C) AMMAN 1898 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Embassy is operating on a normal schedule April 1. </p><p> Consular services are open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center remain suspended, and there is only </p><p>restricted activity by FSN\'s at the Peace Corps office. </p><p>Movements of American staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Embassy received information from the Department </p><p>that a group of 13 Amcit peace activists affiliated with the </p><p>group "Voices in the Wilderness" would be departing Baghdad </p><p>for Amman on the morning of April 1 via three minibuses. </p><p>This information has been passed to Task Force West (TF-W) in </p><p>the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) King Abdullah and Queen Rania offered condolences </p><p>March 31 to the families of the five Jordanians killed in two </p><p>separate incidents in Iraq.  All Jordanian dailies provided </p><p>page one, above the fold, coverage of this event in their </p><p>April 1 editions.  According to the official press reports, </p><p>the King "reiterated Jordan\'s rejection of the war on Iraq </p><p>and his deep concern for the fate of innocent civilians -- </p><p>the victims of the ongoing war." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In response to press reports that British troops had </p><p>discovered an arms cache near Basra marked "Jordan Armed </p><p>Forces, the government-affiliated Jordan Times April 1 quoted </p><p>Minister of Information Mohammed al-Adwan as saying "we </p><p>cannot confirm that this information is accurate.  And if any </p><p>old stocks are found, they certainly date back to the period </p><p>when there was no embargo on Iraq and consequently no embargo </p><p>on shipments of military equipment." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Jordanian Arabic daily al-Arab al-Yawm reported in </p><p>its March 31 edition an interview by FM Muasher with the </p><p>al-Arabia Satellite television station in which Muasher </p><p>reiterated again publicly that "Jordanian airspace is not </p><p>open to U.S. aircraft" and reaffirmed that "the presence of </p><p>U.S. forces in Jordan is for training and defense purposes </p><p>and that Jordan would not be a platform for launching any </p><p>attacks from its territory against Iraq."  Muasher also </p><p>asserted that "contacts between the Jordanian and Iraqi </p><p>governments are continuing" pointing to the "230 Jordanian </p><p>trucks carrying goods and medicines that have gone to Baghdad </p><p>since the start of military operations."  Muasher stated as </p><p>well that Jordanian elections "would be held on the date the </p><p>government has fixed." (ref A) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Jordanian Arabic daily al-Dustur reported that an </p><p>unnamed Iraqi diplomat told the paper that "his country </p><p>started to supply Jordan once again with crude oil and fuel </p><p>oil as of yesterday after resolving technicalities that had </p><p>prevented the loading of Jordanian oil tankers."  The Iraqi </p><p>diplomat claimed that "a number of Jordanian oil tankers </p><p>arrived at an oil and fuel loading point west of Baghdad </p><p>yesterday and were loaded as usual." (ref B)  It should be </p><p>noted that the assertion of the quoted Iraqi diplomat runs </p><p>counter to the information the Ambassador received from </p><p>Minister of Information Mohammed al-Adwan in a private </p><p>conversation March 30, in which al-Adwan said that seven </p><p>Jordanian oil tank trucks had been dispatched to Iraq but had </p><p>returned to Jordan empty and that Jordan would make no </p><p>further attempts to import Iraqi crude. (ref C)  The Foreign </p><p>Minister assured the Ambassador on April 1, that he would </p><p>watch carefully any developments in this issue; he knew of no </p><p>new plans to lift Iraqi crude and would alert the Ambassador </p><p>should he hear otherwise. "There will be no surprises." </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) No new issues. </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) No new issues. </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>9. (SBU) The Jordan-Iraq border remains open.  UNHCR reports </p><p>that six TCNs crossed into Jordan from Iraq overnight March </p><p>31/April 1 and one person with document problems remains in </p><p>no-man\'s land at the border.  Separately, IOM officials asked </p><p>refcoord to postpone today\'s planned monitoring trip to the </p><p>Ruweished transit camp.  Refcoord will report details septel. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) According to UNHCR, Reuters carried a news report </p><p>overnight that US military forces had taken over the Iraqi </p><p>side of the Trebil border crossing into Jordan.  GOJ border </p><p>officials told UNHCR this morning that Iraqi officials </p><p>remained in control of the Iraqi side of the border crossing </p><p>but that US military forces "possibly" could be 60 km from </p><p>the border crossing. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) No new issues. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
