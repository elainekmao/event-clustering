<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 001762 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: SPECULATON BUILDS FOR POSSIBLE ROYAL INTERVENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0740 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1008 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 1316 </p><p>     D. (D) KATHMANDU 1748 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL PMAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The Embassy believes that King Gyanendra is now </p><p>actively considering use of his Constitutional authority to </p><p>dismiss the current government, appoint an interim </p><p>government, and postpone general elections scheduled for </p><p>November 13.  The King\'s decision is likely shaped by </p><p>numerous factors, including the deteriorating security </p><p>situation and declining confidence in Prime Minister Deuba </p><p>and his troubled Cabinet.  The King will probably weigh </p><p>reactions from foreign allies important to Nepal, such as the </p><p>U.S., UK, Japan, India, and China, before making a final </p><p>decision.  We believe that the King may elicit USG reaction </p><p>during a September 12 meeting (arranged at the request of the </p><p>Palace) with the Ambassador.  The Ambassador is also meeting </p><p>with the Prime Minister the morning of September 12, where </p><p>the same subject may arise.  Department is requested to </p><p>review suggested Para 13 talking points on this subject and </p><p>convey any changes to Embassy by COB September 11.  End </p><p>summary and action request. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ELECTION PREPARATIONS: </p><p>PLODDING AT BEST </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Since the May 22 dissolution of Parliament, </p><p>preparations for mid-term national elections, scheduled for </p><p>November 13, have proceeded haltingly at best.  Campaigning </p><p>has been hindered by the unpredictable security situation, as </p><p>well as by the bitter fight between rival factions of Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s own Nepali Congress Party. </p><p>Despite frequent suggestions from within the government, the </p><p>security forces, political parties, and NGOs that voting will </p><p>be held in staggered phases across the country to minimize </p><p>the security risk, the Election Commission has yet to </p><p>announce such a schedule.   (Note:  We have just heard the </p><p>schedule may be out before the end of the week.  End note.) </p><p>Many sources point to the Commission\'s continued failure to </p><p>publish an election schedule--as well as its apparent </p><p>procrastination in deciding which rival Nepali Congress </p><p>faction is legitimate--as evidence of increasing uncertainty </p><p>that polls can be held by the November 13 date. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Overshadowing any preparation for elections is the </p><p>very real threat of Maoist violence directed against </p><p>candidates, voters, and election officials.  Maoist </p><p>insurgents have pledged to disrupt the elections, and the </p><p>sharp, recent surge in violence has demonstrated their </p><p>apparently undiminished ability to do so.  Attacks against </p><p>local-level mainstream political cadre are increasing.  A </p><p>human rights activist who recently held public programs in </p><p>Syangja and Pyuthan Districts told us that local Maoists were </p><p>poised to disrupt the programs until they learned the topic </p><p>was human rights, rather than elections.  (One Maoist cadre </p><p>reportedly told the organizer, "We\'re not against human </p><p>rights.  We\'re just against free and fair elections.")  A </p><p>former MP who flew into Gorkha District to inspect damage to </p><p>a bridge said he was immediately surrounded by armed Maoists </p><p>upon landing.  Once the Maoists learned he was not there to </p><p>promote the elections, however, they let him continue his </p><p>visit. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>DEUBA\'S DECLINING STOCK </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Despite this grim scenario, Prime Minister Deuba </p><p>claims to be as committed as ever to beginning </p><p>elections--even if only partial elections--by November 13. </p><p>Sources close to the PM indicate that he feels he has staked </p><p>his credibility as a leader on keeping to the November 13 </p><p>deadline--however unrealistic it may be.  Elections held on </p><p>this date run a substantial risk of being flawed, incomplete, </p><p>and marred by violence. If he is unable to hold elections by </p><p>that date, he has told the British DCM, he will step down. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Deuba\'s insistence on holding the elections, viewed </p><p>against the backdrop of mounting security concerns both </p><p>within and outside of Kathmandu, may do little to promote </p><p>public confidence in his judgment.  For many observers, ugly </p><p>intra-party feuds and petty partisan squabbling seem to have </p><p>commanded most of the PM\'s attention over the past few </p><p>months, rather than more pressing matters of general national </p><p>concern, such as the insurgency or the troubled economy. </p><p>Recent corruption scandals sparked by the widely applauded </p><p>new anti-corruption bill have spotligthed a variety of pulic </p><p>officials, including one of his closest advisors (Ref D), and </p><p>have focused popular dissatisfaction on the widely perceived </p><p>lack of good governance in successive governments since the </p><p>restoration of democracy 12 years ago. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>DECLINING OPTIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Ref C outlined three possible scenarios after the </p><p>dissolution of Parliament:  a) flawed and/or partial </p><p>elections beginning o/a November 13; b) indefinite </p><p>postponement of the elections, pending improvements in the </p><p>security situation; and c) royal intervention under Clause </p><p>127 of the Constitution.  Given the sharp deterioration in </p><p>the security climate since the summer and given Deuba\'s </p><p>reported unwillingness to postpone elections, the Embassy </p><p>finds increasing evidence that royal intervention is under </p><p>active consideration. (Comment:  Clause 127 grants the King </p><p>broad authority to "issue necessary Orders to remove (any) </p><p>difficulty" that may arise in the implementiation of the </p><p>Constitution.  The language is sufficiently vague to appear </p><p>to give the King ample latitude to take any steps he deems </p><p>necessary--possibly including the dissolution of a sitting </p><p>government--to restore order.  End comment.)  Many observers </p><p>believe that if elections do begin by November 13, the </p><p>Constitution may be interpreted as requiring the current </p><p>government to step down.  (Note:  This last is subject to </p><p>judicial interpretation.  The Constitution contains no </p><p>specific provision for what happens in the event elections </p><p>are not held on time.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)   The military, motivated by increasing concerns </p><p>about its ability to provide security for elections, may also </p><p>be advising the King to take action to defer the November 13 </p><p>polling date.  The Election Commission has revised an earlier </p><p>estimate of polling places needed for the election upward </p><p>from 7,000 to 10,000.  One high-ranking military officer said </p><p>privately that the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) would be hard </p><p>pressed to provide adequate security for so many additional </p><p>polling places.  The main public line of the RNA to us and </p><p>others, however, is that the military will be ready and able </p><p>to provide security. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)   The King had previously told the Ambassador that he </p><p>agreed to Deuba\'s request to dissolve Parliament contingent </p><p>upon the PM\'s formation of a smaller, more capable Cabinet, </p><p>free from chronic political in-fighting and committed to </p><p>tackling corruption (Ref B).  The ongoing inner Nepali </p><p>Congress Party squable between Deuba and Party President </p><p>Koirala has kept the Prime Minister from acting on the King\'s </p><p>request, however.  Instead, the PM has clung to his allies </p><p>that remain in the Cabinet, the seniormost member of which is </p><p>now deeply embroiled in a corruption scandal himself.  Palace </p><p>sources have told the Japanese embassy that Deuba\'s position </p><p>is growing increasingly "weaker."  The King, through his </p><p>advisors (Ref C), has also intimated in the past that he was </p><p>considering using Clause 127 to postpone elections until the </p><p>security situation improves and form an interim government </p><p>focused on addressing the nation\'s most pressing problems. </p><p>Over the past week, speculation among a variety of </p><p>well-placed sources that the King may be ready to act has </p><p>become louder.  Sepculation regarding the composition of such </p><p>an interim government (alternatively described as </p><p>multi-partisan, non-partisan technocrats, or some combination </p><p>of the two) also abounds.  Today\'s rumors include former </p><p>Prime Minister Chand or former Prime Minister and former </p><p>Leader of the Opposition Madhav Nepal to head a new </p><p>government.  (Comment:  Chand, who served as Prime Minister </p><p>three times previously and who is associated with the old and </p><p>discredited panchatat system would be hard for many Nepalis </p><p>to swallow.  Nepal heads the major opposition party, but the </p><p>Nepali Congress Party had a majority in the Parliament that </p><p>was dismissed in May.  Thus the choice of either could be </p><p>problematic.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  A reliable source close to the King has told us that </p><p>the King would want the major political parties to come to </p><p>him with the suggestion that he bless an interim government. </p><p>On September 10 a military advisor to the King told DATT that </p><p>the King is contemplating invoking his authority under Clause </p><p>127, but would consult with the U.S., UK, and Japan before </p><p>doing so (septel IIR).  On September 11 the Palace notified </p><p>the Ambassador that the King wishes to meet him the evening </p><p>of September 12.  He also will be meeting with the British </p><p>Ambassador that same day (at British request, however).  We </p><p>expect the King to elicit USG reaction to invocation of </p><p>Clause 127 during this meeting.  (Note:  The Ambassador and </p><p>the British Ambassador are also scheduled to meet the Prime </p><p>Minister the morning of September 12.  We expect the same </p><p>topic may arise during the meeting with the Prime Minister as </p><p>well.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY, CONSENSUS ARE KEY </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Recent Maoist success in staging large-scale attacks </p><p>against the Army and police in different parts of the </p><p>country, combined with a series of bomb explosions in the </p><p>heart of Kathmandu, have made the GON\'s ability to hold free </p><p>and fair elections more questionable than ever.  Holding </p><p>elections in the current environment seems certain to put </p><p>voters, candidates, and election officers at significant </p><p>risk.  Maoist intimidation, moreover, will doubtless depress </p><p>voter turn-out substantially.  In some areas, it remains </p><p>doubtful that polling can take place outside of district </p><p>headquarters.  Elections held under such circumstances are </p><p>almost certain to be flawed, undermining the legitimacy of </p><p>any government so elected.  Should the current government </p><p>postpone elections, however, Deuba\'s personal </p><p>credibility--and possible motives of self-interest in </p><p>postponing facing disgruntled voters in the polls--could be </p><p>questioned. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Of the three possible scenarios outlined in Para 6 </p><p>above, royal intervention under Clause 127 of the </p><p>Constitution may be the most practical, provided three </p><p>factors are observed.  First, the intervention should be </p><p>performed in strict accordance with the (admittedly broad) </p><p>provisions of the Constitution.  Second, the King should </p><p>attempt to obtain multi-partisan national consensus for such </p><p>action.  Third, the King should emphasize that his </p><p>intervention is a temporary measure, necessitated by the </p><p>critical security situation confronting the country, and </p><p>announce a date for elections as soon as possible, preferably </p><p>within one year. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  In previous conversations with the Ambassador, the </p><p>King has emphasized his commitment to democracy (Refs A and </p><p>B).  We have no reason to believe he is dissembling. Although </p><p>public suspicions about his possible role in his late </p><p>brother\'s death have substantially subsided, we believe that </p><p>the King remains sensitive to this early popular mistrust and </p><p>will work hard to avoid re-igniting it.  He is perceived to </p><p>be above partisan politics, and may thus be the only national </p><p>figure capable of uniting the fractious mainstream parties to </p><p>develop a strategy to address the root causes of the </p><p>insurgency and, perhaps ultimately, a strategy for possible </p><p>future negotiations with the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  Embassy requests Department clearance by COB </p><p>September 11 on the talking points below in the event that </p><p>the subject of royal intervention is raised in the </p><p>Ambassador\'s September 12 meetings with the Prime Minister </p><p>and the King. </p><p> </p><p>Begin suggested talking points: </p><p> </p><p>--The security climate raises significant doubt that free and </p><p>fair elections can be safely held according to the stipulated </p><p>schedule. </p><p> </p><p>--Any action taken by the King to intervene should be done in </p><p>strict accord with the Constitution. </p><p>--We suggest seeking advice from the Supreme Court before </p><p>taking such action. </p><p> </p><p>--The King should emphasize the temporary nature of the </p><p>intervention, perhaps by appending a future date for national </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>--Multi-partisan consensus on royal intervention will be </p><p>crucial to the success of this action. </p><p> </p><p>End text of suggested talking points. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
