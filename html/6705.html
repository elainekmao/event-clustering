<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001770 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, EFIN, ETRD, CASC, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 9 (3/24 1600 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS GMP20030323000339 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The Embassy continues on a normal schedule, with </p><p>consular services open.  Services at ancillary facilities -- </p><p>the Peace Corps office and the American Language Center -- </p><p>remain suspended. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A large demonstration (3,000 students) at Amman\'s </p><p>Jordan University on 3/23 became unruly according to </p><p>international television reports.  PSD security personnel </p><p>used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators </p><p>after they attempted to leave the campus. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Companies operating in Jordan\'s Qualifying Industrial </p><p>Zones (QIZs) report no order cancellations or other problems </p><p>since the beginning of U.S. military action against Iraq. QIZ </p><p>businesses are operating as normal. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Bilateral Debt Agreement Signed:  Local Arabic </p><p>language newspapers covered in their economic pages the March </p><p>23 signing of a bilateral debt rescheduling agreement by </p><p>Ambassador Gnehm and Finance Minister Marto.  Reporting was </p><p>factual, emphasizing assistance that the U.S. has provided </p><p>Jordan and including the Ambassador\'s comments emphasizing </p><p>the strength of the U.S.-Jordan relationship.  All the </p><p>articles commented that this was part of an ongoing U.S. </p><p>commitment to support Jordan and that war-specific aid is </p><p>planned, but has not yet been approved. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Japanese Economic Assistance to Jordan:  The </p><p>Japanese Embassy confirmed that the Japanese government </p><p>intends to provide $100 million to Jordan to mitigate adverse </p><p>economic impacts on Jordan of the conflict in Iraq, </p><p>particularly the disruption of oil supplies and trade with </p><p>Iraq.  The assistance will be provided in the form of Yen 6 </p><p>billion (about $50 million) in a non-project grant, with the </p><p>remainder project-based assistance.  Specific projects to be </p><p>covered by this commitment have yet to be determined. </p><p>Foreign Minister Kawaguchi provided this commitment to </p><p>Foreign Minister Muasher. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ministry of Industry and Trade reported that 120 </p><p>tractor trailer trucks carrying UN-approved food, medicine </p><p>and other humanitarian goods to Iraq under the Oil-for-Food </p><p>program have returned to Amman following the withdrawal of UN </p><p>Cotecna inspectors from Iraq.  Additional shipments are being </p><p>held in Amman.  The Ministry is now having to deal with </p><p>exporting companies who are upset at the financial losses </p><p>they and their employees face.  The Ministry told us that </p><p>alternative markets for the goods, some of which are </p><p>perishable, are not easy to identify. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Queen Alia Airport Director Nasri Nowar told econoff </p><p>March 23 that "7 or 8" Iraqis who arrived in Amman on the </p><p>last RJ flight from Baghdad (Amman 1661) remained at the </p><p>airport.  He said they were awaiting transit to third </p><p>countries, including a few to the United States.  He added </p><p>that they held valid visas, and said they were going for </p><p>training.  The remainder, he said, were bound for Lebanon or </p><p>Africa.  Nowar said that passenger traffic continued to </p><p>improve, and that normal operations continued. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.

NIV applicant </p><p>numbers are up from yesterday, although still fewer than </p><p>normal. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) PM Abul Ragheb, FM Muasher and Minister of Information </p><p>al-Adwan held a joint press conference on the evening of </p><p>3/23.  Abul Ragheb: </p><p>-- stated that Jordan is seeking "to present new ideas and </p><p>opinions that would be acceptable to the parties concerned in </p><p>order to stop the military operations and save Iraq and the </p><p>lives of its citizens." </p><p> </p><p>-- reiterated the GOJ\'s long held public posture that Jordan </p><p>"is not party to the ongoing war and will never be used as a </p><p>launching pad for a military operation against Iraq." </p><p>-- categorically denied that U.S. military operations in </p><p>Iraq\'s western desert had been launched from Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>-- publicly confirmed that shipments of Iraqi crude had </p><p>stopped and </p><p>-- said the GOJ had asked the Iraqi Embassy to remove five of </p><p>its diplomats for "performing acts that were incompatible </p><p>with their diplomatic status and affect Jordan\'s security." </p><p>(today\'s newspapers quote Abul Ragheb as saying that Jordan </p><p>later allowed two of the five to remain.) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Demonstration by approximately 400 persons currently </p><p>underway at Al-Zaytouna University on the airport highway </p><p>outside Amman on the morning of March 24.

PSD is attempting </p><p>to track down the source of the leaflets. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.

(C) IOM reports that a second group of some 150 Sudanese </p><p>left the Ruweished transit camp Sunday en route to Khartoum </p><p>via an IOM-chartered RJ flight. 11 Egyptians were scheduled </p><p>to leave Aqaba via bus that same evening. South African </p><p>officials were scheduled to pick up eight "human shields" who </p><p>arrived Saturday night. The camp population will be down to </p><p>less than 100 after the above departures.
