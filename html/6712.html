Under headline "What will this war achieve?" the </p><p>      pro-government "Daily Mirror" dedicated its </p><p>      March 24 editorial to denouncing the war against </p><p>      Iraq, saying, "Instead of freeing the Iraqis, he </p><p>      (President George W. Bush) is ensnaring them </p><p>      into deeper poverty and distress."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .It is becoming clear that instead of </p><p>      delivering the world from danger, Bush is </p><p>      endangering the world more.  Instead of freeing </p><p>      the Iraqis, he is ensnaring them into deeper </p><p>      poverty and distress.  Iraq is a country already </p><p>      struggling under-year-old international </p><p>      sanctions, with levels of poverty having already </p><p>      reached alarming proportions, according to the </p><p>      U.N.  A worse catastrophe is the mounting death </p><p>      toll directly related to military operations. </p><p>      For how long can the world afford this killing </p><p>      and destruction of a city and a country that was </p><p>      once the capital of the Islamic world. . .?  As </p><p>      we have said before, the real objectives of this </p><p>      war are being ignored.  President Bush himself </p><p>      stated last week that the so-called allies </p><p>      wanted to replace the present administration </p><p>      with a U.S.-led military dictatorship before </p><p>      installing a puppet government run by local </p><p>      people.  That is hardly the way to create a </p><p>      democracy.  What this will only achieve is the </p><p>      looting of resources of the world\'s eighth </p><p>      largest oil producer and boost the egos of the </p><p>      Bush clan, which felt embarrassed about failing </p><p>      to topple Saddam during the Gulf War.  The rest </p><p>      of the story is about murder and mayhem." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
