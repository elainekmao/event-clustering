<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MANILA 006761 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/20/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, MOPS, PREL, KISL, PGOV, RP </p><p>SUBJECT: MISUARI TO USG "I\'M NO TERRORIST" </p><p> </p><p>REF: MANILA 6730 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR STEVEN E. ZATE, REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: NUR MISUARI HAS DECIDED TO REVERT BACK TO HIS </p><p>ARMED SEPARATIST WAYS, BUT HAS SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES CLAIMING THAT HE WILL NEVER BE A TERRORIST AND </p><p>HAS NOT ALLIED HIS FORCES WITH THOSE OF THE ABU SAYYAF GROUP </p><p>(ASG).  A MISUARI EMISSARY HAS TOLD EMBASSY MANILA HE INTENDS </p><p>TO BE AN "HONEST ADVERSARY" IN HIS RENEWED FIGHT AGAINST THE </p><p>PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT (GOP) BUT EVEN NOW IS OPEN TO A REAL </p><p>AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR "TRUE AUTONOMY" FOR MUSLIMS.  THE </p><p>MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT - MISUARI FACTION (MNLF-MF) </p><p>MESSENGER INDICATED THAT A FULL POLITICAL AND MILITARY </p><p>ALLIANCE BETWEEN HIS GROUP AND THE ARMED MORO ISLAMIC </p><p>LIBERATION FRONT (MILF) IS IMMINENT AND THAT JOINT MNLF/MILF </p><p>OPERATIONS AGAINST GOP FORCES HAVE ALREADY BEGUN IN CENTRAL </p><p>MINDANAO.  THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR - MISUARI HAS AGAIN TAKEN TO </p><p>THE HILLS BUT HE DOES NOT WANT TO MAKE AN ENEMY OF THE U.S. </p><p>OR BE BRANDED AS AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GET THE WORD TO THE US </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) POLOFF MET NOVEMBER 21 WITH REV. ABSALOM CERVEZA, A </p><p>PROTESTANT CLERGYMAN WHO IS DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE SOUTHERN </p><p>PHILIPPINES COUNCIL FOR PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT (SPCPD) UNDER </p><p>THE OFFICE PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT MACAPAGAL-ARROYO.  CERVEZA IS </p><p>A LONG TIME SUPPORTER OF MNLF FOUNDER (AND SUSPENDED MUSLIM </p><p>REGIONAL GOVERNOR) NUR MISUARI AND WAS APPOINTED BY MISUARI </p><p>TO HIS CURRENT POST.  HE REMAINS MISUARI\'S CLOSE CONFIDANT </p><p>AND ADVISOR.  CERVEZA SAID MISUARI HAD ASKED HIM TO PASS </p><p>SEVERAL MESSAGES TO THE EMBASSY AND THE USG.  HE TOLD US THAT </p><p>MISUARI HAS DECIDED THAT THERE IS NO CURRENT HOPE THAT THE </p><p>GOP WILL TRULY HONOR ITS COMMITMENTS TO GRANT TRUE AUTONOMY </p><p>TO THE MUSLIMS - AS CALLED FOR IN THE TRIPOLI AGREEMENT OF </p><p>1976 AND THE PEACE AGREEMENT OF 1996 SIGNED BY BOTH PARTIES. </p><p>SINCE THAT IS THE CASE, MISUARI HAS DECIDED TO GO BACK TO THE </p><p>HILLS AND LEAD HIS REJUVENATED MNLF FACTION IN THE "ONLY </p><p>NEGOTIATION THE GOP TRULY UNDERSTANDS - ARMED WARFARE." </p><p>CERVEZA SAID THAT MISUARI, WHO REMAINS WITH HIS FIGHTERS IN </p><p>SULU PROVINCE, WANTS THE USG TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS </p><p>"NO TERRORIST," AND "HAS NO LINKS WITH THE TERRORIST ABU </p><p>SAYYAF."  MISUARI\'S MAN NOTED THAT HIS LEADER HAS </p><p>"CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNED THE ASG AND THEIR UN-ISLAMIC BANDITRY </p><p>AGAINST INNOCENTS." </p><p> </p><p>"IT\'S THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAULT" </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CERVEZA SAID THAT MISUARI BELIEVES THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO HAS RECEIVED BAD ADVICE FROM SEVERAL </p><p>MEMBERS OF HER CABINET LED BY HER PEACE ADVISER EDUARDO </p><p>ERMITA, SPECIAL PROJECTS ADVISER NORBERTO GONZALES, AND </p><p>DEFENSE SECRETARY ANGELO REYES.  THESE THREE HAD CONSPIRED </p><p>WITH MEMBERS OF MISUARI\'S MNLF CENTRAL COMMITTEE LED BY </p><p>PAROUK HUSSIN TO OUST HIM AND MANIPULATE THE NOVEMBER 26 </p><p>ELECTIONS IN THE AUTONOMOUS REGION OF MUSLIM MINDANAO (ARMM) </p><p>TO ENSURE A HUSSIN WIN.  ACCORDING TO CERVEZA THIS WAS THE </p><p>LAST STRAW IN A LONG-RUNNING GOP CAMPAIGN TO DEMOLISH </p><p>MISUARI\'S REPUTATION AND DIGNITY AND TO BRING HIM DOWN IN THE </p><p>EYES OF HIS SUPPORTERS AND ALL MUSLIMS.  "MISUARI IS A PROUD </p><p>MAN AND WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS DISHONOR, WHILE AT 60 HE IS </p><p>NOT YOUNG, HE IS OUT TO PROVE THAT HE STILL ENJOYS THE </p><p>SUPPORT OF MANY MUSLIMS," CERVEZA SAID.  TO PROVE THIS, </p><p>MISUARI HAS SENT HIS FAMILY OUT OF THE COUNTRY, HAS PICKED UP </p><p>HIS ASSAULT RIFLE, HAS REFURBISHED HIS MILITARY COMMAND </p><p>STRUCTURE, AND IS FINALIZING A FORMAL RECOMBINING OF THE MNLF </p><p>AND THE MILF LED BY HASHIM SALAMAT.  (NOTE: SALAMAT BROKE </p><p>WITH THE MNLF IN THE LATE 1970S AFTER DISAGREEMENTS WITH </p><p>MISUARI OVER HOW TO PUSH FOR MUSLIM INDEPENDENCE AND A MORE </p><p>ISLAMIC UNDERPINNING FOR THE SEPARATIST MOVEMENT.  END NOTE.) </p><p> ACCORDING TO CERVEZA THIS AMALGAMATION IS IMMINENT AND MILF </p><p>AND MNLF-MF FORCES HAVE ALREADY COOPERATED IN JOINT </p><p>OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES (AFP) </p><p>IN SULU AND IN CENTRAL MINDANAO. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CERVEZA ASSERTED THAT THE GOP SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT </p><p>MISUARI WOULD JUST GO AWAY, AS THEY EXPECTED HIM TO DO.  "THE </p><p>MAN IS NOT STUPID.  HE COULDN\'T BE BOUGHT OFF WITH AN </p><p>AMBASSADORSHIP IN SAUDI ARABIA OR TURKEY," CERVEZA SAID. </p><p>"NOW THAT MISUARI IS MAKING HIMSELF A MILITARY FORCE TO BE </p><p>RECKONED WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHAT TO </p><p>DO," HE CLAIMED.  "THEY HAVE NO PLAN AND HAVE LEFT MISUARI NO </p><p>CHOICE BUT TO RETURN TO THE HILLS."  CERVEZA ADDED THAT </p><p>MISUARI BELIEVES THAT HE WILL FORCE THE GOP TO DEAL WITH HIM </p><p>AND HIS FOLLOWERS POLITICALLY TO ASSURE TRUE AUTONOMY ONLY IF </p><p>HE NOW PURSUES THE MILITARY OPTION.  MISUARI\'S MAN INDICATED </p><p>THAT THE GOP WILL NOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN ARMED MNLF AGAIN </p><p>BECAUSE IT FAILED AT DEALING WITH UNARMED MUSLIMS WHO WANTED </p><p>A STRAIGHT POLITICAL SHAKE FOR THE "MORO NATION." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) HUBRIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PRICKLY MISUARI\'S BIGGEST </p><p>FAILING, AND THIS HAS PROMPTED HIM TO TRY AND REVIVE HIS PAST </p><p>GLORY AS A TOUGH LEADER OF AN ARMED SEPARATIST MOVEMENT.  THE </p><p>GOP, IN TURN, UNDERESTIMATED HIS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>BE A PLAYER.  A GENUINE MNLF (SULU-BASED AND MOSTLY ETHNIC </p><p>TAUSUG) TIE-UP WITH THE MILF (MOSTLY CENTRAL MINDANAO-BASED </p><p>MAGUINDANAOS AND MARANAOS) IS A DAUNTING PROSPECT AND SHOULD </p><p>GIVE GOP MILITARY PLANNERS AND POLITICAL POLICY-MAKERS PAUSE. </p><p> MISUARI IS THE MAJOR POWER BROKER IN THE ISLAND PROVINCE OF </p><p>SULU AND THE GOP HAS ITS HANDS FULL WITH THE ASG IN BASILAN </p><p>TO THE NORTH.  AN MILF/MNLF ALLIANCE IS NOT A DONE DEAL </p><p>BECAUSE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT LED TO THEIR SPLIT REMAIN. </p><p>IN ADDITION, THE MILF LEADERSHIP REMAINS IN PEACE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOP, AND WHILE THESE TALKS ARE </p><p>PROCEEDING SLOWLY, THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>OPENING OF ANOTHER SEPARATIST FRONT THROUGH MILF/MNLF </p><p>COOPERATION IN CENTRAL MINDANAO WILL NOT BE GOOD FOR THE </p><p>CREAKY, POORLY LED, AND RESOURCE-POOR AFP.  THE AFP STILL HAS </p><p>TO CONTEND WITH A NAGGING COMMUNIST INSURGENCY IN SCATTERED </p><p>PARTS OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND HAVING TO BATTLE ON TOO MANY </p><p>FRONTS LEAVE IT STRETCHED EXTREMELY THIN.  PRESIDENT </p><p>MACAPAGAL-ARROYO RETURNS TO THE COUNTRY FROM THE US AND </p><p>MEXICO ON NOVEMBER 22.  THIS ITEM WILL BE AT THE TOP OF HER </p><p>NOW EVEN MORE PRESSING SECURITY AGENDA.  WITH ALL THE RECENT </p><p>PUBLICITY ABOUT US ASSISTANCE TO DESTROY THE ASG, MISUARI MAY </p><p>HAVE WANTED TO EXPLAIN HIS MOTIVES IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID </p><p>HAVING IS RE-ARMED SEPARATIST FORCES BECOME ANOTHER DIRECT </p><p>(OR INDIRECT) US TARGET.  PROBABLY A WISE MOVE. </p><p> </p><p>FITTS </p><p></p></div>
