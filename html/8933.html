Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" </p><p>on 6/23 entitled "Chandelier". "President Bush is trying to </p><p>reconfigure the U.S.\'s alliances with its southern </p><p>neighbors. Bush visited Europe to reunite with his </p><p>colleagues from the G-8; tensions decreased between France </p><p>and Germany, yet it seems Bush and Chirac do not have enough </p><p>chemistry. A few weeks later the European Union, imposed </p><p>sanctions on Cuba because of this country\'s political </p><p>opposition, in a move that some have interpreted as an </p><p>action to get closer to Washington." </p><p> </p><p>"The U.S. and Brazil are enhancing their bilateral </p><p>relationship, and to prove that, President Bush agreed to </p><p>aid President Lula in his `Zero Hunger Project\'. Although, </p><p>the Brazilian press has noted that Lula has slighted his </p><p>deal because Bush did not compromise to the Brazilian </p><p>aspiration to become a member of the U.N. Security Council. </p><p>Chile has already signed a FTA with the U.S. Even though </p><p>some Central American countries are part of the `coalition\' </p><p>and are sending troops to aid in Iraq\'s reconstruction, they </p><p>still cannot sign a CAFTA agreement because the Central </p><p>American countries have not yet agreed on a common </p><p>proposal." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
