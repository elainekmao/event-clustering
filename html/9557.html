<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 003267 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, JULY 14-21: WOMEN\'S </p><p>POLITICAL RIGHTS; AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO KUWAIT; IRAQ; </p><p>GUANTANAMO BAY; A/S BURNS VISIT TO KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: On July 14, Kuwaiti Islamist commentator (and </p><p>regular al-Jazeera talking head) Mohammed al-Awadi wrote an </p><p>editorial directed at US Ambassador to Kuwait Richard H. </p><p>Jones, urging the Ambassador to stop "interfering" in </p><p>Kuwait\'s internal affairs, warning that "someone might lose </p><p>control and try to assassinate you." Liberal editorialists </p><p>defended the Ambassador as "a dear friend" who has </p><p>"contributed to maintaining good relations between the two </p><p>countries." Another Islamist writer calls on Ambassador </p><p>Jones to convert to Islam. </p><p> </p><p>On July 21, all newspapers carry Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah </p><p>Al-Ahmad\'s statement that "women\'s rights are our goal." </p><p>While one Islamist MP states that the participation of women </p><p>in parliament is "prohibited by religion," other </p><p>commentators believe that Kuwait\'s democracy and overall </p><p>development will be "crippled" without the full </p><p>participation of women in society. </p><p> </p><p>One newspaper reported increased security along Kuwait\'s </p><p>border with Iraq to prevent Saddam loyalists from entering </p><p>Kuwait. A Kuwaiti delegation is reported to be heading to </p><p>Guantanamo Bay to meet with Kuwaiti detainees and US </p><p>officials. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: On July 21, all newspapers front-page </p><p>Prime Minister Shiekh Sabah Al-Ahmad\'s statement that, </p><p>"women\'s rights are our goal." Al-Qabas reports that </p><p>Islamist MP Daifallah Bou Ramia stated that the </p><p>participation of women in the Parliament is "prohibited by </p><p>religion." Independent Shiia MP Dr. Yousef Zalzala </p><p>reportedly said that, "democracy will remain crippled </p><p>without the participation of women." </p><p> </p><p>Interior Minister Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad denied reports that </p><p>Iran had asked Kuwait to receive Al-Qaeda spokesman Suleiman </p><p>Abu Ghaith, Al-Seyassah reports on July 19. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas newspaper reports that a delegation from the </p><p>Ministry of Interior will be departing for Guantanamo Bay </p><p>within two weeks to meet with Kuwaiti detainees there and to </p><p>discuss their situation with American officials. </p><p> </p><p>A "security source" tells Al-Anba that security along </p><p>Kuwait\'s northern border with Iraq has been increased due to </p><p>concerns that supporters of Saddam Hussein may attempt to </p><p>enter Kuwait to carry out sabotage operations. </p><p> </p><p>The most important challenges facing education in Kuwait are </p><p>the elimination of the word "Jihad" from the curriculum and </p><p>the raising of "an aware generation" of students, Al-Qabas </p><p>reports. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that the National Union of Kuwait Students- </p><p>U.S. branch is closely monitoring the cases of Kuwaiti </p><p>students who did not register with the Department of </p><p>Homeland Security before leaving the United States. </p><p> </p><p>On July 17, Al-Rai Al-Aam carried comments by American </p><p>Ambassador to Kuwait, Richard H. Jones, in response to an </p><p>editorial by an Islamist writer (see para 3). Ambassador </p><p>Jones stated that "my hopes for women reflect the principles </p><p>I believe in." </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Stay at Your Embassy and Leave Us in Peace" </p><p>Islamist columnist Mohammed Al-Awadi wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Rai Al-Aam (7/14): "Perhaps it has become known by now that </p><p>the [June 24-25] visit by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State </p><p>William Burns was not a visit of apology [for the </p><p>postponement of President Bush\'s visit]. but rather to </p><p>encourage the political rearrangement of Kuwait. . This door </p><p>has to be closed otherwise interventions will increase </p><p>quantitatively and qualitatively. . The actions of the </p><p>American Ambassador in Kuwait are no less sensitive than </p><p>what was done by [Assistant Secretary] Burns. The American </p><p>Ambassador in Kuwait visited MPs who are against the entry </p><p>of women into the Kuwaiti parliament. [and] a number of </p><p>electoral headquarters of Islamist MPs who won in the recent </p><p>parliamentary elections. . If the objective is acquisition </p><p>by women of the right to vote and to stand for office, this </p><p>question will be addressed. . Oh Ambassador, we do not </p><p>believe in violence. We, as Islamists, do not accept what </p><p>was done on September 11 or the blasts in Morocco and Riyadh </p><p>as a means to accomplish change. But you know well how </p><p>people are angry at America, the supporter of Israeli </p><p>terror. .  What if one of our citizens looses control of </p><p>himself at one of the electoral tents or diwaniyas and </p><p>attacks you and attempts to assassinate you? You will shake </p><p>the security of our country and lead us to countless numbers </p><p>of problems. Oh Ambassador, stay at your embassy and leave </p><p>us in peace." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "We Welcome Our Friend, Richard Jones" </p><p>Mohammad al-Qadairi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (7/19): </p><p>"The people of Kuwait need to learn about the views of the </p><p>US administration through its Ambassador. . The admiration </p><p>of Kuwaiti people [for Ambassador Jones] has increased due </p><p>to his comments in the fields of economics, politics and </p><p>development. In such a democratic society, we need sound </p><p>advice to find solutions for the greater interests of </p><p>Kuwait. Therefore, it is illogical, or even illegal, to </p><p>attack his activities. We welcome our dear friend Ambassador </p><p>Jones to Kuwait\'s diwaniyas [men\'s gatherings] and its </p><p>political forums." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Ambassadors and Colleagues" </p><p>Sami Al-Nisef wrote in independent Al-Anba (7/19):  "Many </p><p>Kuwaitis were sad for the offense addressed to the </p><p>Ambassador of the friendly United States by one of our </p><p>colleagues. The American Ambassador is known for his good </p><p>manners and his contribution to maintaining good relations </p><p>between the two countries." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "To the American Ambassador: I Call on You to Enter </p><p>Islam" </p><p>Islamist Hamed Al-Ali wrote in independent Al-Watan (7/19): </p><p>"I do not believe that the American Ambassador needs a long </p><p>time to find how generous and kind the Kuwaiti people are. </p><p>Our vision would not be completed if we not call upon him to </p><p>enter Islam. Therefore, in my name and the name of the </p><p>Kuwaiti people, I call upon you to recognize Islam, to </p><p>become a Muslim and to defend issues of concern to Muslims </p><p>and put an end to the greediness of great power nations." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "The New MPs and Women\'s Political Rights" </p><p>Hassan Al-Musawi wrote in independent Al-Qabas (7/17): </p><p>"Efforts to ignore women\'s political rights will negatively </p><p>affect the country\'s development process. Some people </p><p>believe women\'s political rights are based on `imported\' </p><p>Western thought. Such logic is completely wrong given the </p><p>fact granting women their political rights is based on a </p><p>pure, fair Islamic vision." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "The Iraqi Human Being" </p><p>Dr. Ahmad Al-Baghdadi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(7/21):  "It is obvious that the Iraqis are not civilized </p><p>people. They have looted their museums and institutions </p><p>instead of protecting them. Iraqis had no rights and lived </p><p>in fear of Saddam\'s regime, but now, after the coalition </p><p>forces allowed them to breathe in freedom, they curse them. </p><p>Religious scholars in Iraq are agitating Iraqis to kill </p><p>coalition soldiers. Iraqis have disclosed their true </p><p>character after having had the world believe that they are </p><p>civilized people. In fact, they have proven that they are </p><p>not concerned with their country and have no appreciation </p><p>for the allied forces or Kuwait which helped them in their </p><p>liberation." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
