(C) SUMMARY: ASSISTANT SECRETARY SUSAN E. RICE MET </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ON NOVEMBER 16.  TSVANGIRAI OFFERED FOUR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SCENARIOS UNDER WHICH THE CURRENT POLITICAL CRISIS COULD </p><p>UNFOLD.  HE BELIEVES A TRANSITIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>THE BEST WAY OUT OF THE CRISIS PITTING THE PEOPLE </p><p>AGAINST THEIR UNPOPULAR LEADER.  MASS ACTION WILL BE </p><p>CONSIDERED INITIALLY AT THE MDC\'S NATIONAL COUNCIL </p><p>MEETING NOVEMBER 24.  MASS ACTION WOULD BE INTENDED TO </p><p>PRESSURE PRESIDENT MUGABE TO RESIGN.  THE MDC </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THE SERIOUS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MASS </p><p>ACTION, TSVANGIRAI PROFESSED, AND RECOGNIZES THAT IT IS </p><p>IN THE COUNTRY\'S BEST INTEREST TO AVOID BLOODSHED. </p><p>EVERYONE IS FOCUSED ON SEEING MUGABE GO, BUT IT WILL </p><p>PROBABLY TAKE A CONVERGENCE OF OPPOSITION FROM ZANU-PF, </p><p>THE MILITARY, AND REGIONAL LEADERS TO FORCE HIM OUT. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 16, ASSISTANT SECRETARY SUSAN E. </p><p>RICE, HER DELEGATION, AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, DCM, AND </p><p>POLOFF (NOTETAKER) HAD A BREAKFAST MEETING WITH MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI.  TSVANGIRAI WAS ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY MDC NATIONAL CHAIRMAN ISAAC MATONGO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06677  01 OF 03  291400Z </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>TSVANGIRAI LOOKS INTO THE CRYSTAL BALL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) TSVANGIRAI BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HE SEES THREE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE: LAWLESSNESS, THE LAND </p><p>QUESTION, AND THE ECONOMY, AND EMPHASIZED THAT THE </p><p>ECONOMY IS THE MOST DIRE PROBLEM.  HE ALSO STATED THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) IS TRYING TO POLARIZE </p><p>THE POLITICAL PLAYERS IN THE COUNTRY.  THE MDC LEADER </p><p>SEES FOUR POTENTIAL SCENARIOS EMERGING FROM THE CURRENT </p><p>POLITICAL CRISIS: 1) THE PEOPLE WAIT 18 MONTHS TO VOTE </p><p>MUGABE OUT--THIS IS THE MOST CONSTITUTIONAL, BUT LEAST </p><p>LIKELY SCENARIO.  2) THERE IS AN ACCELERATED, BUT STILL </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL, PROCESS WHEREBY MUGABE RESIGNS OR IS </p><p>EASED OUT AT THE DECEMBER ZANU-PF CONGRESS.  THIS IS NOT </p><p>VERY LIKELY EITHER SINCE MUGABE HAS OUSTED THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY EXECUTIVES THAT MIGHT CHALLENGE HIS </p><p>INTENTION TO RUN AGAIN IN 2002.  3) MASS ACTION IS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN, FORCING MUGABE TO LEAVE THE SCENE EARLY. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI STATED THAT THIS OPTION MUST BE CAREFULLY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CONSIDERED, AND HE ASKED RHETORICALLY: DO WE WANT TO </p><p>PUSH OUT AN ELECTED PRESIDENT BEFORE HIS TERM IS UP?  4) </p><p>AN ARMY COUP THAT REMOVES MUGABE, POSSIBLY WITH A GREAT </p><p>DEAL OF BLOODSHED, FROM WHICH IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT </p><p>FOR ZIMBABWE TO RECOVER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IDEALLY, TSVANGIRAI CONTINUED, THE MDC WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO SEE A TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENT FOR THE NEXT TWO </p><p>YEARS WHERE ZANU-PF REMAINED IN CONTROL OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT BUT BROUGHT IN MDC MINISTERS--ESSENTIALLY, A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06677  01 OF 03  291400Z </p><p>COALITION GOVERNMENT.  THE GOAL OF A TRANSITIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD BE TO ARREST THE ECONOMIC DECLINE, </p><p>RESTORE INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE IN ZIMBABWE, AND </p><p>ESTABLISH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS FOR PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>FIRST TO MAKE A COALITION GOVERNMENT MORE FEASIBLE, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI STATED THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROCESS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SHOULD BE BROAD-BASED AND WELL-CONSIDERED. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO GO THROUGH </p><p>THAT PROCESS NOW.  HE SAID THE ECONOMY IS THE PRIORITY </p><p>ISSUE BECAUSE CONFIDENCE MUST BE RESTORED IN IT BEFORE </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN 2002.  IT DOESN\'T MAKE </p><p>SENSE TO TALK ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION WHILE THE PEOPLE </p><p>ARE SUFFERING. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>MASS ACTION IS ON THE TABLE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE OPPOSITION LEADER WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE </p><p>COUNTRY CANNOT CONTINUE AS IT HAS FOR ANOTHER SIX </p><p>MONTHS.  WE KNOW THAT ZIMBABWE IS NOT LIKE YUGOSLAVIA, </p><p>BUT THE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING CHANGE BEFORE THE SITUATION </p><p>GETS WORSE, HE PROFESSED.  UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, </p><p>THE MDC WOULD WAIT UNTIL 2002 FOR CHANGE, BUT THE </p><p>ECONOMIC DECLINE IS SO STEEP THAT IF IT WAITS THAT LONG, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1865 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06677  02 OF 03  291401Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------A54E56  291401Z /38 </p><p>O 291359Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7739 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 006677 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/29/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ECON, PINR, ZI, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSISTANT SECRETARY MEETS WITH ZIMBABWE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06677  02 OF 03  291401Z </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADER </p><p> </p><p>THERE WILL BE "NOTHING TO VOTE FOR" BY THE TIME THE </p><p>ELECTION ARRIVES.  THE MDC\'S NATIONAL COUNCIL , AT LEAST </p><p>INITIALLY, WILL MEET NOVEMBER 24 TO CONSIDER MASS </p><p>ACTION.  IF THE EXECUTIVE DECIDES TO CONDUCT A MASS </p><p>ACTION, IT WILL MOST LIKELY BE IN THE FORM OF GENERAL </p><p>STRIKE TO BEGIN IN MID-DECEMBER WHEN CHILDREN ARE HOME </p><p>FROM SCHOOL AND BUSINESSES BEGIN TO CLOSE ANYWAY FOR THE </p><p>CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY.  THIS WOULD MINIMIZE THE ECONOMIC </p><p>IMPACT ON THE POPULATION, TSVANGIRAI BELIEVES.  (NOTE: </p><p>THE MDC\'S NATIONAL COUNCIL CANCELLED PLANS FOR MASS </p><p>ACTION AT ITS NOVEMBER 24 MEETING.  SEE REFTEL.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  HE SAID THE MDC UNDERSTANDS THE MAGNITUDE AND </p><p>SERIOUSNESS OF MASS ACTION, AND IT HAS TRIED TO POSTPONE </p><p>IT FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, BUT THE POPULAR SENTIMENT IS </p><p>TO DO IT.  A GENERAL STAY-AWAY IS PREFERABLE TO </p><p>CONFRONTATION SINCE IT IS NOT IN THE COUNTRY\'S BEST </p><p>INTEREST TO HAVE VIOLENCE OR BLOODSHED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ON THE GOZ\'S REACTION TO A MASS DEMONSTRATION IN </p><p>HARARE, TSVANGIRAI BELIEVED THE ARMY WOULDN\'T HESITATE </p><p>TO SHOOT A LOT OF PEOPLE.  HE THOUGHT ITS REACTION WOULD </p><p>BE LESS SEVERE IN OTHER CITIES LIKE BULAWAYO AND MUTARE, </p><p>WHERE THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IS MUCH FEWER AND THEIR </p><p>LOYALTY TO MUGABE MORE QUESTIONABLE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>HE SEES THE MILITARY AS DIVIDED.  MUGABE HAS </p><p>APPROPRIATED THE TOP BRASS FOR HIS OWN ENDS, AND THEY </p><p>ARE LOYAL TO HIM.  HOWEVER, THE BULK OF THE MILITARY\'S </p><p>LOWER RANKS DO NOT SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT, TSVANGIRAI </p><p>CLAIMED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06677  02 OF 03  291401Z </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>HOW TO GET MUGABE OUT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE MILITARY IS ONE OF THE THREE MAJOR </p><p>INFLUENCES ON MUGABE, TSVANGIRAI CONTINUED.  THE OTHER </p><p>TWO ARE ZANU-PF AND REGIONAL LEADERS.  IF MUGABE IS TO </p><p>BE PRESSURED TO LEAVE THE SCENE, ALL THREE MUST TURN </p><p>AGAINST HIM, THE OPPOSITION LEADER DECLARED.  WHEN ASKED </p><p>WHAT ELSE MIGHT INDUCE MUGABE TO STEP DOWN, TSVANGIRAI </p><p>SAID THE PRESIDENT WILL DO SO ONLY AFTER HE HAS HAD HIS </p><p>REVENGE AGAINST THE WHITES AND ONLY AFTER HE HAS REIGNED </p><p>IN ZANU-PF DISSIDENTS AND UNIFIED HIS PARTY.  MUGABE IS </p><p>A VINDICTIVE PERSON, TSVANGIRAI PROFESSED.  FOR ITS </p><p>PART, THE MDC RECOGNIZES MUGABE AS THE NATION\'S FIRST </p><p>LEADER AND A VERY IMPORTANT ONE IN ITS HISTORY.  THE MDC </p><p>WON\'T ENGAGE IN RETRIBUTION AGAINST MUGABE AND HIS </p><p>SUPPORTERS, TSVANGIRAI HINTED, BECAUSE "WE CAN\'T FOCUS </p><p>ON THE PAST IF WE ARE TO MOVE FORWARD."  WHILE MUGABE IS </p><p>PRESIDENT, THE MDC LEADERSHIP WON\'T MAKE PERSONAL </p><p>COMMENTS ABOUT HIM, AS THAT WOULD JUST INFLAME THE </p><p>SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ROLE OF REGIONAL LEADERS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY ASKED THE MDC LEADER </p><p>ABOUT THE ROLE REGIONAL LEADERS COULD PLAY IN RESOLVING </p><p>THE SITUATION.  TSVANGIRAI STATED THAT AFTER INITIALLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06677  02 OF 03  291401Z </p><p>SHOWING AMBIVALENCE TOWARD ZIMBABWE, SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI HAS RECENTLY STARTED TO TALK MORE FIRMLY </p><p>AND IS SHOWING SIGNS HE WILL NO LONGER TOLERATE THE </p><p>SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE.  TSVANGIRAI MENTIONED THAT ON HIS </p><p>LAST VISIT TO SOUTH AFRICA, HE MET WITH FORMER PRESIDENT </p><p>MANDELA--WHO STILL EXERTS GREAT INFLUENCE IN SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA, HE STATED--AND URGED THE LEADER TO INTERVENE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  HE DID NOT RECEIVE A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM </p><p>MANDELA, HOWEVER, AND DID NOT SEE MBEKI.  ZAMBIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT CHILUBA HAS BEEN DISTANT WITH THE MDC.. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>MDC\'S VIEW ON LAND ISSUE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ON THE LAND ISSUE, TSVANGIRAI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>LAND REFORM WAS "UNFINISHED" BUSINESS AND MUST BE </p><p>ADDRESSED SERIOUSLY BY ANY GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p>HOWEVER, EQUITY, LEGALITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY MUST BE </p><p>KEYSTONES TO ANY SUCCESSFUL LAND REFORM PROGRAM.  THE </p><p>MDC SUPPORTS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LAND COMMISSION TO </p><p>OVERSEE THE REDISTRIBUTION OF LAND.  THE MDC ALSO SEES </p><p>THE 1998 DONORS CONFERENCE AS THE STARTING POINT FOR </p><p>LAND REFORM, AND IT WOULD SUPPORT THE UNDP LAND </p><p>INITIATIVE, THE OPPOSITION LEADER STATED.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>SAID THAT WHEN HE WAS IN THE UK RECENTLY, HE TOLD THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1866 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06677  03 OF 03  291401Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------A54E5D  291401Z /38 </p><p>O 291359Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7740 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 006677 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/29/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ECON, PINR, ZI, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSISTANT SECRETARY MEETS WITH ZIMBABWE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06677  03 OF 03  291401Z </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADER </p><p> </p><p>BRITISH TO REFRAIN FROM MAKING PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON LAND </p><p>REFORM IN ZIMBABWE AND TO USE ITS INFLUENCE BEHIND THE </p><p>SCENES TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>ZIMBABWE NEEDS A PEACEFUL TRANSITION </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF A PEACEFUL POLITICAL TRANSITION TO THE OPPOSITION </p><p>LEADER.  THE USG SEES HUGE RISKS--WITH FEW, IF ANY, </p><p>UPSIDES--TO MASS ACTION, AND URGED THE MDC TO MANAGE THE </p><p>POLITICAL TRANSITION CAREFULLY.  WE HAVE URGED THE GOZ </p><p>NOT TO USE LETHAL FORCE ON DEMONSTRATORS, AND WE URGE </p><p>THE OPPOSITION NOT TO GET IN A SITUATION WHERE LETHAL </p><p>FORCE MIGHT BE USED, THE SECRETARY SAID.  THE USG ALSO </p><p>WANTS TO ENCOURAGE THE MDC TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>MODERATES IN ZANU-PF, EVEN IF PRIVATELY.  A/S RICE </p><p>AFFIRMED THE USG\'S WILLINGNESS TO FACILITATE SUCH </p><p>CONTACTS, IF DESIRED.  SHE ALSO PUSHED THE MDC TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH ITS </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL PRESENCE IN PARLIAMENT, AND LAMENTED THE MDC </p><p>FAILURE TO ENGAGE IN THE PREPARATION OF THE BUDGET, </p><p>DESPITE THE FINANCE MINISTER\'S SOLICITATION OF MDC </p><p>INPUT.  SUCH ENGAGEMENT, RICE ARGUED, WOULD SHOW THAT </p><p>THE MDC IS A SERIOUS AND CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO ZANU- </p><p>PF.  TSVANGIRAI, WHEN PRESSED, RELUCTANTLY TOOK THIS </p><p>POINT ON BOARD. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06677  03 OF 03  291401Z </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT: TSVANGIRAI WAS FRANK, CONFIDENT AND </p><p>RELAXED.  HOWEVER, HE DID NOT CONVINCE US THAT THE MDC </p><p>HAS A CLEAR OR WELL-THOUGHT-OUT PLAN FOR MASS ACTION OR </p><p>WHAT IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH.  HIS COMMENTS SUGGESTED THE </p><p>MDC IS PINNING HOPE ON INTERNAL ZANU-PF MACHINATIONS TO </p><p>FORCE MUGABE FROM POWER.  HIS PUBLIC APPROVAL OF FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER MAKONI\'S BUDGET, AS REPORTED IN THE NOVEMBER 17 </p><p>"THE DAILY NEWS," MAY BE AN INDICATION OF HIS </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE CREDIBLE </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERSHIP.  TSVANGIRAI IS CLEARLY UNDER </p><p>PRESSURE FROM THE PUBLIC TO LEAD A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p>OTHER INTERLOCUTORS HAVE TOLD US THAT IF HE DOES NOT DO </p><p>SO SOON, HE HIMSELF MAY BE FORCED FROM THE PARTY </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  NOW THAT THE QUESTION OF MASS ACTION IS </p><p>MOOT FOR THE TIME-BEING, IT WILL BE UP TO TSVANGIRAI TO </p><p>CHANNEL THE PEOPLE\'S, AND HIS OWN PARTY MEMBERS\', </p><p>FRUSTRATION INTO CONSTRUCTIVE CHANGE.  IF TSVANGIRAI CAN </p><p>DO THAT, HIS POSITION WILL BE STRENGTHENED IMMEASURABLY, </p><p>BOTH HERE AND ABROAD.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.
