<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001922 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR CINDY COURVILLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NI, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO\'S ROLE IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: JETER-COURVILLE TELCON 7/30/01 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a July 31 meeting scheduled to discuss other issues </p><p>(septel), Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by EconOff </p><p>(notetaker), raised with President Obasanjo, as promised in </p><p>reftelcon, Nigeria\'s continuing role in addressing the </p><p>deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe. Obasanjo was very </p><p>forthcoming as he explained the leadership role he has played </p><p>so far, in cooperation with Mbeki and others, in resolving </p><p>tensions between the UK and Zimbabwe over land seizures and </p><p>other issues.  From his animation on this issue, it is clear </p><p>that Obasanjo will remain deeply and personally engaged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Obasanjo commented that he first intervened in this </p><p>issue in December 1999 after a meeting with Robin Cook where </p><p>the Foreign Secretary had expressed deep dissatisfaction with </p><p>Mugabe\'s unwillingness to work with the UK on the issue of </p><p>voluntary sales/transfers of white-owned land to rural </p><p>Zimbabweans.  Obasanjo was later able to bring Mugabe and </p><p>Cook together to begin a constructive dialogue.  The </p><p>President emphasized that Zimbabwe\'s neighbors, particularly </p><p>South Africa and Namibia, are "frightened stiff" over the </p><p>spill-over effect the land seizures could have on their own </p><p>countries.  Obasanjo claimed that while Mugabe believed land </p><p>seizures were bringing him significant domestic political </p><p>mileage, Obasanjo thought this political mileage was at the </p><p>expense of the country\'s economic and social development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) President Obasanjo recommended that land seizures </p><p>would be more effectively addressed within a forum that also </p><p>included discussion of human rights, rule of law, and </p><p>democracy issues in Zimbabwe.  The President declared that </p><p>although Mugabe was not initially in favor of such an </p><p>approach, he had since acquiesced.  Obasanjo claimed that </p><p>Mugabe had also agreed to stop additional land seizures, </p><p>although the Zimbabwean President ultimately will seek to </p><p>claim an additional 1.5 million hectares for a total of 5 </p><p>million hectares of land available for sale/transfer to rural </p><p>Zimbabweans. </p><p>4. (C) Obasanjo mentioned that "they" (apparently a reference </p><p>to himself and Mbeki) are now looking at proposals to </p><p>establish a financing mechanism to pay for the 3.5 million </p><p>hectares already seized.  Obasanjo alluded to a UK land fund, </p><p>and mentioned others in the international community, </p><p>including the U.S. and EU, who might be approached to help </p><p>cover payment for 2.5 million hectares.  Although the </p><p>President did not give a monetary figure to the hectare </p><p>purchases, he said that Mugabe wants "adequate compensation;" </p><p>Obasanjo said that he favors the "willing-buyer, </p><p>willing-seller" approach.  Mugabe, he said, has agreed not to </p><p>grab additional land until the funds are available to pay for </p><p>it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Obasanjo chided Mugabe for seeking to address this </p><p>issue through the OAU, and the inclusion of states such as </p><p>Libya.  The OAU effort had gone nowhere and lacked </p><p>credibility.  Instead, Obasanjo said he had recommended that </p><p>next steps on Zimbabwe be pursued through the Commonwealth </p><p>with the following countries participating: Nigeria, Jamaica, </p><p>United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>Commonwealth Secretary General would also take part. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment.  The UK DCM in Abuja has told us that HMG </p><p>does not believe the GON is an effective "honest broker" </p><p>because public comments made by Nigerian FM Sule Lamido </p><p>appear too supportive of Mugabe and GOZ hard-liners. </p><p>Nevertheless, Obasanjo is likely to remain personally engaged </p><p>on this issue, given his animation when addressing the </p><p>subject and his penchant for involvement on issues of "high </p><p>politics".  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
