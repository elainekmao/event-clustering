<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 004003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y - TEXT </p><p> </p><p>CINCPAC/CENTCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05/29/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MNUC, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN:  PM\'S MAY 28 LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLCOUNS DAN MOZENA.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THIS MESSAGE CONVEYS FOR THE RECORD THE TEXT OF PRIME </p><p>MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF\'S MAY 28 LETTER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON.  THE </p><p>LETTER HAD EARLIER BEEN FAXED TO SA/PAB; THE ORIGINAL IS BEING SENT </p><p>BY POUCH. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>28TH MAY 1998 </p><p>HIS EXCELLENCY </p><p>MR. WILLIAM J. CLINTON </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, </p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. </p><p> </p><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, </p><p> </p><p>I WISH TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERILOUS </p><p>SITUATION RESULTING FROM INDIA\'S NUCLEAR TESTS.  OUR TELEPHONIC </p><p>CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST FORTNIGHT CONVINCED ME OF YOUR SINCERITY </p><p>AND YOUR GENUINE CONCERN FOR PAKISTAN\'S SECURITY AND THE STABILITY </p><p>OF THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>THE OVERT NUCLEAR WEAPONIZATION OF INDIA HAS CREATED A STRATEGIC </p><p>IMBALANCE, EMBOLDENING INDIAN LEADERSHIP TO HOLD OUT THREATS OF </p><p>NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL AGAINST PAKISTAN AND AGGRESSION ACROSS THE LINE </p><p>OF CONTROL IN KASHMIR. </p><p> </p><p>AS ADVISED BY YOU AND OUR OTHER FRIENDS, WE PONDERED HARD AND </p><p>DELIBERATED CAREFULLY ON OUR DIRE SECURITY PREDICAMENT.  DETERMINED </p><p>TO ACT WITH UTMOST RESPONSIBILITY, DESPITE GRAVE PROVOCATIONS, WE </p><p>ALSO CLOSELY EVALUATED THE INTERNATIONAL REACTION, WHICH </p><p>REGRETTABLY DID NOT FACTOR THE THREAT TO OUR SECURITY AND TO </p><p>REGIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE I WAS DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR PERSONAL UNDERSTANDING OF </p><p>OUR SECURITY CONCERNS, THE OVERALL INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO </p><p>INDIA\'S CROSSING OF THE NUCLEAR THRESHOLD WAS REGRETTABLY </p><p>DEFERENTIAL, BORDERING ON ACQUIESCENCE.  WE SAW A FAMILIAR PATTERN, </p><p>WHEREBY INDIA\'S INCREMENTAL STEPS ON THE NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC </p><p>LADDER HAD ONLY GENERATED PRESSURES AND EVEN PUNITIVE ACTIONS </p><p>AGAINST PAKISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS, PAKISTAN ADVOCATED, IN ALL EARNEST, THE </p><p>GOAL OF NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION.  OUR IMPECCABLE RECORD OF </p><p>RESTRAINT AND RESPONSIBILITY NEVER EARNED US ANY APPROBATION. </p><p>SELECTIVE SANCTIONS ONLY SERVED TO DEGRADE OUR CONVENTIONAL </p><p>CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCED A TOTALLY UNTENABLE SECURITY EQUATION </p><p>BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA. </p><p> </p><p>THE EVIDENT SELECTIVITY IN THE PURSUIT OF THE GLOBAL NON- </p><p>PROLIFERATION GOALS, WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THE UNDERLYING SECURITY </p><p>PROBLEMS THAT IMPEL PROLIFERATION, HAD INCENSED OUR PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE, AT WHICH OUR VERY LIFE AND EXISTENCE ARE </p><p>AT STAKE, THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN WERE UNANIMOUS IN DEMANDING THAT </p><p>WE SEEK TO RECTIFY THE STRATEGIC IMBALANCE RESULTING FROM NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONIZATION BY INDIA. </p><p> </p><p>HAVING EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS AND LEFT WITH NO CHOICE, WE HAVE IN </p><p>OUR SUPREME NATIONAL INTEREST DECIDED TO EXERCISE THE NUCLEAR </p><p>OPTION.  THIS DECISION, WHICH I HAVE TAKEN WITH A HEAVY HEART, WAS </p><p>NECESSITATED BY THE IMPERATIVES OF SELF-DEFENCE AND TO DETER </p><p>AGGRESSION AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY, INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL </p><p>INTEGRITY OF OUR COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE NEED FOR URGENT STEPS TO BRING ABOUT NUCLEAR </p><p>STABILIZATION BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA.  I HAVE, THEREFORE, </p><p>OFFERED TO DISCUSS WITH INDIA, ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE REGION AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR </p><p>BILATERAL DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>WE TRUST THAT THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER MAJOR POWERS WILL </p><p>ENCOURAGE AND FACILITATE NOT ONLY THE RESUMPTION OF THE PAKISTAN- </p><p>INDIA TALKS BUT EARLY CONCLUSION OF MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE RESTRAINTS, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY CONFIDENCE ENHANCING MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>WE WOULD ALSO URGE YOU TO FULLY ENDORSE AND SUPPORT OUR PROPOSAL </p><p>FOR A NON-AGGRESSION PACT BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA, ON THE BASIS </p><p>OF AN EXPEDITIOUS SETTLEMENT OF THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR DISPUTE. </p><p> </p><p>I AM ALSO REQUESTING THE LEADERS OF THE OTHER G-8 COUNTRIES TO </p><p>SERIOUSLY CONSIDER COLLECTIVELY INITIATING EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH </p><p>PAKISTAN AND INDIA TO URGENTLY ADDRESS STABILIZATION MEASURES SO AS </p><p>TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE AND TO REDUCE THE </p><p>DANGERS OF A NUCLEAR CONFLICT IN SOUTH ASIA. </p><p></p></div>
