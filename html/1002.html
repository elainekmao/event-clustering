(U) CLASSIFIED BY CONSUL GENERAL JOHN E. HERBST, </p><p>REASON 1.5(B). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  PALESTINIANS INCREASINGLY COMPLAIN THAT </p><p>ARAFAT\'S COTERIE OF "GATEKEEPERS" ARE EXERCISING A </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF POWER AND PREVENTING PEOPLE </p><p>WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WITH ARAFAT FROM GETTING </p><p>AN AUDIENCE.  MANY PALESTINIANS BELIEVE THIS GROUP IS </p><p>PREVENTING ARAFAT FROM HEARING FROM KEY CONSTITUENTS </p><p>WHO COULD GIVE HIM A SENSE OF THE DEEP LEVEL OF </p><p>MISTRUST AND ALIENATION THAT MANY PALESTINIANS FEEL </p><p>TOWARD THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA).  ONE GATEKEEPER </p><p>-- "ABU SAOOD" -- PULLS A PARTICULARLY NEGATIVE </p><p>REACTION.  HE IS A THIRD GRADE DROP OUT WHO STARTED AS </p><p>A COFFEE BOY WITH FATAH IN AMMAN THIRTY YEARS AGO AND </p><p>HAS NOW RISEN TO A POSITION OF CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE. </p><p>ABU SAOOD\'S RECENT CONFRONTATION WITH FATAH WEST BANK </p><p>HIGHER COMMITTEE HEAD MARWAN BARGHOUTI AND THE </p><p>POLITICAL BATTLE IT HAS HELPED KICKED OFF IS ONLY THE </p><p>LATEST EXAMPLE OF THIS GROUP\'S INFLUENCE.  THE </p><p>FOLLOWING PIECE PROFILES ABU SAOOD.  IT IS GLEANED FROM </p><p>THE COMMENTS AND INFORMATION GATHERED BY CONGEN FSN. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>WHO IS ABU SAOOD? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  SA\'ED ZAHRAN ALLAAN, KNOWN COMMONLY BY HIS NOM </p><p>DE GUERRE "ABU SAOOD," WAS BORN AROUND 1949 INTO A </p><p>FAMILY OF NINE IN THE WEST BANK VILLAGE OF DEIR ABU </p><p>MASH\'AL, LOCATED NORTHWEST OF RAMALLAH NEAR THE GREEN </p><p>LINE.  HIS FATHER, A PEASANT, WANTED HIM TO GET A GOOD </p><p>EDUCATION AND SENT HIM TO SCHOOL IN THE NEIGHBORING </p><p>VILLAGE OF ABOUD.  AFTER FAILING TWICE TO PASS THE </p><p>THIRD GRADE, HE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AND JOINED HIS </p><p>FATHER IN WORKING THE LAND. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 20, ABU SAOOD MOVED TO AMMAN </p><p>ON THE ADVICE OF A RELATIVE WHO TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD </p><p>FIND HIM A JOB IN SAUDI ARABIA OR KUWAIT.  THE PROMISED </p><p>JOB NEVER MATERIALIZED AND THE DESTITUTE ABU SAOOD WAS </p><p>FORCED TO WORK AT DAILY LABOR JOBS IN AMMAN\'S VEGETABLE </p><p>MARKET TO SUPPORT HIMSELF.  THROUGH A RELATIVE, HE </p><p>MANAGED TO LAND A JOB WITH FATAH IN THE LATE 60\'S AS </p><p>THE COFFEE SERVER IN THE OFFICE OF THE LATE FATAH </p><p>LEADER SALAH KHALAF (ABU IYAD).  (NOTE: COFFEE AND TEA </p><p>SERVERS ARE FOUND IN VIRTUALLY ALL PALESTINIANS OFFICES </p><p>IN DEFERENCE TO THE ARAB CUSTOM OF SERVING VISITORS </p><p>REFRESHMENT.  COFFEE SERVERS CAN BE AGING MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE OFFICE WHO STILL NEED A STIPEND OR AMBITIOUS YOUNG </p><p>OPERATORS SEEKING UPWARD MOBILITY THROUGH DAILY CONTACT </p><p>WITH THEIR BOSSES.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>ABU SAOOD\'S CLIMB </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) FOLLOWING THE PLO\'S EXPULSION FROM JORDAN IN </p><p>1970, ABU IYAD AND ABU SAOOD RELOCATED TO BEIRUT.  HE </p><p>WAS PROMOTED TO MESSENGER BOY, WHICH REQUIRED HIM TO </p><p>DELIVER MESSAGES AND LETTERS FROM ABU IYAD TO THE </p><p>DIFFERENT PLO OFFICES, INCLUDING ARAFAT\'S.  FATAH </p><p>CONTACTS AND MEMBERS OF ARAFAT\'S OFFICE SAY THAT </p><p>WHENEVER THE OUT-GOING ABU SAOOD WENT TO ARAFAT\'S </p><p>OFFICE HE SPENT EXTRA TIME BUILDING FRIENDSHIPS WITH </p><p>THE CHAIRMAN\'S STAFF AND BODY GUARDS.  HE ALSO REPORTED </p><p>THE GOINGS-ON AT THE ARAFAT OFFICE TO ABU IYAD.  IT IS </p><p>SAID THAT DR. RAMZI KHOURY, A KEY FIGURE AT THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN\'S OFFICE AND LONG-TIME CONFIDANT ARAFAT, </p><p>BECAME AWARE OF ABU SAOOD\'S REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p>KHOURY DECLINED TO TURN ABU SAOOD IN TO ARAFAT, AND </p><p>INSTEAD OFFERED HIM A GOOD JOB IN ARAFAT\'S OFFICE IN </p><p>THE FUTURE IF HE BEGAN REPORTING ON ABU IYAD\'S OFFICE. </p><p>ABU SAOOD ACCEPTED AND BEGAN INFORMING ON ABU IYAD TO </p><p>KHOURY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  IN THE LATE 1970\'S, ABU SAOOD MOVED TO </p><p>ARAFAT\'S OFFICE, AS KHOURY HAD PROMISED.  DURING HIS </p><p>INITIAL STINT, HE ANSWERED TELEPHONE CALLS, RECEIVED </p><p>GUESTS AND SHOWED THEM TO THE CHAIRMAN\'S OFFICE.  HE </p><p>WAS NOT GIVEN ANY OFFICIAL TITLE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MOHAMMED ADWAN, THE HEAD OF FOREIGN MEDIA RELATIONS FOR </p><p>ARAFAT\'S OFFICE, ABU SAOOD PROVED HIMSELF USEFUL TO </p><p>ARAFAT THROUGH HIS ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BETWEEN </p><p>PLO FIGHTERS AND MEMBERS OF THE CHRISTIAN PHALANGIST </p><p>MILITIA, MANY OF WHOM HE HUNG OUT WITH IN BEIRUT\'S BARS </p><p>AND BROTHELS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE MOST FAMOUS (AND COLORFUL) STORY ABOUT </p><p>THIS PERIOD IN ABU SAOOD\'S LIFE ALSO LED TO HIS NEXT </p><p>"PROMOTION."  ACCORDING TO THE STORY/LEGEND, DURING THE </p><p>PLO\'S BEIRUT DAYS ARAFAT BECAME VERY AGITATED WITH </p><p>SA\'AD SALAAM, THE EDITOR OF A MAJOR CHRISTIAN NEWSPAPER </p><p>WHO CONSTANTLY WROTE DISPARAGING STORIES ABOUT HIM. </p><p>DURING A DINNER WITH HIS AIDES, THE CHAIRMAN COMPLAINED </p><p>ABOUT THE CHRISTIAN EDITOR AND ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE </p><p>DONE WITH HIM.  WHILE SOME OF THE CHAIRMAN\'S AIDES </p><p>HELPFULLY VOLUNTEERED TO ASSASSINATE THE EDITOR, ABU </p><p>SAOOD SOUGHT THE CHAIRMAN OUT WITH ANOTHER IDEA IN </p><p>MIND.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD OF ARAFAT\'S DISPUTE </p><p>WITH QLAAM QOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  HE TOLD A </p><p>DISBELIEVING ARAFAT THAT HE WOULD BRING THE EDITOR, IN </p><p>PERSON, TO THE HIS OFFICE AND HAVE HIM APOLOGIZE TO HIM </p><p>AND PROMISE NEVER TO WRITE ANYTHING INSULTING AGAINST </p><p>THE CHAIRMAN AGAIN.  THE CHAIRMAN IS SAID TO HAVE </p><p>LAUGHED AT ABU SAOOD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE NEXT DAY, HOWEVER, ABU SAOOD SHOWED UP AT </p><p>THE CHAIRMAN\'S OFFICE ACCOMPANIED BY THE EDITOR.  TRUE </p><p>TO ABU SAOOD\'S PLEDGE, THE EDITOR APOLOGIZED TO ARAFAT </p><p>AND PROMISED NOT TO WRITE ANYTHING INSULTING ABOUT HIM </p><p>AGAIN.  AFTER THE EDITOR LEFT ARAFAT\'S OFFICE, THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN DEMANDED THAT ABU SAOOD REVEAL HOW HE MANAGED </p><p>TO INDUCE THE EDITOR TO APOLOGIZE.  ABU SAOOD REPORTEDLY </p><p>REVEALED THAT HE HAD BLACKMAILED THE EDITOR OVER A </p><p>SEXUAL INDISCRETION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ABU SAOOD OBTAINED HIS CURRENT TITLE AND A NEW </p><p>LEVEL OF INFLUENCE IN 1992 IN AN EQUALLY DRAMATIC </p><p>FASHION -- HE LITERALLY PUT HIS LIFE ON THE LINE FOR </p><p>THE CHAIRMAN.  ABU SAOOD WAS TRAVELING WITH ARAFAT WHEN </p><p>HIS PLANE CRASHED IN THE LIBYAN DESERT.  REALIZING THAT </p><p>A CRASH WAS IMMINENT, ABU SAOOD REPORTEDLY RUSHED THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN TO THE TAIL SECTION OF THE AIRPLANE AND </p><p>MOBILIZED ARAFAT\'S BODYGUARDS TO SURROUND THE CHAIRMAN, </p><p>ACTING ESSENTIALLY AS "HUMAN PILLOWS."  ABU SAOOD </p><p>HIMSELF EMBRACED ARAFAT TO HELP ABSORB THE SHOCK OF </p><p>IMPACT.  ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS ARAFAT DID AFTER HIS </p><p>RECOVERY WAS AWARD ABU SAOOD THE OFFICIAL TITLE OF </p><p>"HEAD OF PUBLIC RELATIONS AND PROTOCOL" AT HIS OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>REACHING THE PINNACLE, OR THIS IS NOT A MERITOCRACY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  ABU SAOOD, A SHORT, PORTLY MAN WITH A GRUFF </p><p>DEMEANOR, IS NOW WELL-KNOWN TO ANYONE WHO VISITS </p><p>ARAFAT\'S OFFICE.  HE DETERMINES -- FOR MOST VISITORS -- </p><p>WHETHER THEY GET AN AUDIENCE WITH THE CHAIRMAN.  AS HIS </p><p>POWER HAS GROWN, HE HAS ALSO BEGUN TO BE DISPATCHED TO </p><p>EVENTS TO "REPRESENT" ARAFAT\'S OFFICE.  WHEN HE ATTENDS </p><p>AN EVENT IT IS UNIVERSALLY INTERPRETED AS A NOT-SO- </p><p>SUBTLE MEANS OF INTIMIDATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE APPEARED </p><p>AT THE PALESTINIAN COUNCIL SESSIONS LAST SUMMER WHEN </p><p>THE COUNCIL WAS BALKING AT APPROVING ARAFAT\'S NEW </p><p>CABINET.  WHEN HEATED DEBATES ERUPTED, ABU SAOOD WOULD </p><p>SHOW UP TO "LOBBY" QUARRELING COUNCIL MEMBERS.  COUNCIL </p><p>MEMBERS UNANIMOUSLY SAW ABU SAOOD\'S PRESENCE AS BOTH A </p><p>SIGN OF HOW SERIOUSLY ARAFAT WAS ABOUT SECURING </p><p>APPROVAL FOR HIS CABINET AND A CLEAR INDICATION THAT </p><p>VOTING THE WRONG WAY WOULD CARRY A HIGH POLITICAL </p><p>PRICE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  MORE RECENTLY, ABU SAOOD WAS INVOLVED IN A </p><p>CONFRONTATION WITH FATAH WEST BANK HIGHER COMMITTEE </p><p>HEAD MARWAN BARGHOUTI (REF).  THE EVENT HELPED UNLEASH </p><p>THE CURRENT ROUND OF INTENSE POLITICAL WRANGLING THAT </p><p>IS SEEING ELEMENTS IN ARAFAT\'S OLD GUARD TRY TO </p><p>MANEUVER GRASSROOTS FATAH ACTIVISTS OUT OF POSITIONS OF </p><p>POWER.  IN A SIGN OF THE DISTRUST WITH WHICH ABU SAOOD </p><p>IS VIEWED, MANY PALESTINIANS SEE HIM AS ACTING </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY AGAINST BARGHOUTI IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE </p><p>SELF-APPOINTED OVERSEER OF THE PALESTINIAN DOMESTIC </p><p>POLITICAL SCENE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  THE FACT THAT ABU SAOOD EITHER WIELDS THIS </p><p>KIND OF POWER, OR IS ONLY PERCEIVED TO, PROVOKES A </p><p>CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FEAR AND LOATHING AMONG MANY </p><p>POLITICALLY ACTIVE PALESTINIANS.  A NUMBER OF </p><p>PALESTINIANS HAVE RECENTLY INSISTED THAT EVEN MOHAMMED </p><p>RASHID, ARAFAT\'S POWERFUL ECONOMIC ADVISOR, HAS HAD </p><p>TROUBLE GETTING PAST ABU SAOOD.  WHILE THIS IS HARD FOR </p><p>US TO BELIEVE, IT DOES UNDERSCORE THE EPIC NATURE OF </p><p>ABU SAOOD\'S REPUTATION AMONG PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) ABU SAOOD\'S RISE FROM UNEDUCATED MANUAL </p><p>LABORER AND COFFEE BOY TO ONE OF ARAFAT\'S MOST TRUSTED </p><p>AIDES OFFERS A SNAPSHOT OF THE HIGHLY PERSONALIZED WAY </p><p>THAT ARAFAT DOES BUSINESS AND THE DIVIDENDS THAT </p><p>LOYALTY CAN PAY.  ABU SAOOD IS A FREQUENT </p><p>TARGET OF CRITICISM FROM PALESTINIANS WHO BELIEVE THIS </p><p>IS A POOR WAY TO CONDUCT AFFAIRS.  THE CRITICISM ALSO </p><p>STEMS FROM PALESTINIANS\' PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH HIM </p><p>AS A NASTY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS MOST COMMONLY DESCRIBED BY </p><p>CONSULATE CONTACTS AS A "THUG."  (BIONOTE: ABU SAOOD IS </p><p>MARRIED AND HAS ONE OR TWO DAUGHTERS.  HE DOES NOT </p><p>SPEAK ENGLISH.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HERBST </p><p></p></div>
