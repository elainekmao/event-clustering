<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 002766 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, IS, KPAL, EG, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PM BERLUSCONI\'S VISIT TO THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 2495 </p><p> </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 106646 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ACTING POL MC JOHN BASS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>BERLUSCONI SEEING NEITHER ABU MAZEN NOR ARAFAT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) PM Berlusconi\'s swing through the Middle East (Israel, </p><p>Jordan, and Egypt June 9-11) ruffled (French) feathers only </p><p>because some chose to misconstrue Italian motives, </p><p>Berlusconi\'s deputy diplomatic advisor told us June 18. </p><p>Scarante said French FM de Villepin\'s criticism of </p><p>Berlusconi\'s decision not to see Arafat was off-base.  The </p><p>three visits were bilateral in nature; thus there was no </p><p>obligation for Berlusconi to see either Abu Mazen or Arafat. </p><p>Moreover, added Scarante, even though the EU feels that </p><p>Arafat is an important symbol of the Palestinian cause, there </p><p>is no common formal EU position on meeting with Arafat.  The </p><p>EU recognizes that Abu Mazen is the head of the Palestinian </p><p>Government and deals with him in such capacity.  Berlusconi </p><p>had asked to meet with Abu Mazen.  When Abu Mazen told him he </p><p>should also see Arafat, the PM decided to keep his word to </p><p>President Bush (ref B), not see any Palestinian officials, </p><p>keep the visit to Israel strictly bilateral, and invite Abu </p><p>Mazen to Italy soon. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>PRESIDENCY CONTACTS WITH ARAFAT GOVERNED BY EU POSITION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Scarante said the Berlusconi government would have to </p><p>determine how to handle contacts with Arafat during its EU </p><p>Presidency if the EU ever reached a common formal position, </p><p>implying it would be highly unlikely to do so.  As President </p><p>of the EU, Berlusconi would have to respect any formal </p><p>position the EU reaches on Arafat.  So far however, stressed </p><p>Scarante, the only common position on Arafat is that he </p><p>should play a symbolic role and the real power should be in </p><p>the hands of Abu Mazen.  Scarante did not expect much </p><p>discussion of Abu Mazen/Arafat/the MEPP at the June 20-21 EU </p><p>Summit in Thessalonika. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>BERLUSCONI SATISFIED WITH HIS VISIT </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During his three days in the Middle East, Berlusconi </p><p>sought local perspective on the situation in the Middle East </p><p>from PM Sharon, King Abdullah, and President Mubarak.  He </p><p>also wanted to develop the positive personal rapport with </p><p>these key leaders that would help Italy carry out its mission </p><p>as EU President within the Quartet.  Sharon told Berlusconi </p><p>that he welcomed greater EU involvement in the MEPP as long </p><p>as the EU position was well-balanced.  Mubarak remained </p><p>convinced that Arafat could still play an important role and </p><p>cautioned against relying solely on Abu Mazen who, according </p><p>to Mubarak, is too weak politically within the territories </p><p>and does not have the means necessary to combat terrorism by </p><p>himself.  Berlusconi stressed to the three leaders that a </p><p>"Marshall Plan" type of economic aid package to the </p><p>Palestinian economy was not only an economic tool but also a </p><p>mandatory political tool needed to reach a comprehensive </p><p>peace in the region.  The three leaders agreed on the need to </p><p>revive the Palestinian economy.  Berlusconi also offered to </p><p>host the first international peace conference called for in </p><p>the roadmap during the Italian Presidency in Erice, Sicily. </p><p>Sharon did not object to the idea as long the situation on </p><p>the ground actually mirrored what to be expected at the end </p><p>of the first phase of the roadmap. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Berlusconi and Frattini continue to publicly </p><p>maintain that the PM\'s trip to the Middle East June 9-11 was </p><p>at the request of the President.  By casting it in this </p><p>light, Berlusconi avoided an embarrassing court hearing he </p><p>was supposed to attend in Italy June 11 on a pending </p><p>corruption case (ref A). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment continued: "Don\'t meet Arafat" is probably the </p><p>message we have delivered most often to senior Italian </p><p>officials in the past months.  Italian officials assured us </p><p>before the PM\'s visit that he was not going to see Arafat </p><p>(ref A).  The President\'s reiteration of this point just </p><p>prior to Berlusconi\'s departure ended any remote possibility </p><p>he would have considered seeing Arafat.  Even though the EU </p><p> </p><p>does not have a common formal position in favor of seeing </p><p>Arafat, it did ruffle some feathers; but this is clearly a </p><p>price Berlusconi was willing to pay.  Berlusconi\'s decision </p><p>underscores the respect he has for the President.  It also </p><p>shows his desire to play an important part in the Quartet, </p><p>not only by having a more balanced position on the </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian issue than previous Italian governments </p><p>have, but also by being closer to the US position.  This will </p><p>not make his job any easier with some EU countries, but it is </p><p>certainly a good sign on his ability to work well with us in </p><p>the Quartet.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02766 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
