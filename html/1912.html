<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GOVERNOR OF KEBBI\'S THOUGHTS ON THE </p><p>NIGERIAN POLITICAL SCENE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1446 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: The Governor of Kebbi, Mohammed Aleiro, </p><p>called on Ambassador Jeter on August 26.  Aleiro was in Abuja </p><p>prior to his trip with President Obasanjo to China.  In </p><p>addition to a discussion of Kebbi-specific issues, Aleiro </p><p>stated that he did not believe Babangida would run against </p><p>Obasanjo in 2003.  He also said rumors that Governor Makarfi </p><p>would challenge the Vice President for his position were </p><p>untrue.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Governor of Kebbi, Mohammed Aleiro, called on </p><p>Ambassador Jeter on August 26.  Aleiro thanked the Ambassador </p><p>for his June trip to Kebbi State (Reftel), and hoped to have </p><p>further discussions regarding agriculture, education, and </p><p>health care for Kebbi.  The Ambassador informed the Governor </p><p>about the Embassy\'s Self-Help program, the recently signed </p><p>USD 18.5m agreement between USAID and the National Planning </p><p>Commission and other assistance efforts by the Mission.  The </p><p>Ambassador also offered to arrange a meeting for the Governor </p><p>and his staff with USAID to discuss agricultural development, </p><p>education and healthcare.  Aleiro asked about the value of a </p><p>trip to the United States to seek investment and cooperative </p><p>agreements for Kebbi.  Ambassador Jeter noted that other </p><p>governors had done so with some success, and offered to help </p><p>arrange a visit if the Governor was so inclined. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador mentioned his desire to recommend to </p><p>the President a national conference on HIV/AIDS, which would </p><p>include all of Nigeria\'s governors and relevant Cabinet </p><p>officials, to sensitize the Nigerian populace on the issue. </p><p>Governor Aleiro was extremely supportive, and stated that he </p><p>would begin discussing this idea with his fellow governors. </p><p>The Ambassador also mentioned that it appeared as though </p><p>Peace Corps would be returning to Nigeria, and offered that </p><p>Kebbi State might be a good place for the Corps to consider, </p><p>once it begins to expand its operations out of Plateau State. </p><p> Aleiro agreed, and pointed out that Kebbi did not suffer </p><p>from the type of security concerns of many other states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador, noting that he understood that </p><p>President Obasanjo had originally been the "candidate of the </p><p>North," asked if it was true that the President was now </p><p>unpopular in the North.  Aleiro, who belongs to the </p><p>"opposition APP party," said this was "quite true," but </p><p>opined that there was no viable alternative to Obasanjo. </p><p>Obasanjo had kept Nigeria united and had sustained democracy. </p><p> Aleiro further explained that there was a "certain group in </p><p>the North" that had always been in or been connected to power </p><p>in Nigeria, but were not in power now.  This group, the </p><p>Governor lamented, was agitating against the President. </p><p>However, Obasanjo had opposed resource control efforts by the </p><p>South-South states, a position supported by Northerners, and </p><p>many in the South-East.  Obasanjo\'s strong federalism was </p><p>also in the interest of the North, the Governor added.  While </p><p>Obasanjo had demonstrated poor performance on roads, </p><p>electricity, universal basic education and security thus far, </p><p>the Governor praised the President\'s firm support for </p><p>stability and national unity, positions that were critical </p><p>for Nigeria, especially now.  Thus, Aleiro wanted Obasanjo to </p><p>continue as President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador asked whether the Governor believed </p><p>former Head of State Babangida (IBB) would run against </p><p>Obasanjo in 2003.  Aleiro said no, and flatly remarked, </p><p>"(His) record in government is nothing to write home about." </p><p>Aleiro said IBB might push a candidate he could control, but </p><p>thought most of IBB\'s political machinations were for his own </p><p>security and assets; a hedge against any who might try to use </p><p>him as a political scapegoat.  Eventually, all of IBB\'s </p><p>political associations would merge with PDP (the President\'s </p><p>party), Aleiro thought.  He added that the south-west, and in </p><p>fact all of Nigeria, would never forget Babangida\'s annulment </p><p>of the election in 1993, which had been accepted as free and </p><p>fair throughout Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador Jeter asked the Governor about complaints </p><p>of the North being marginalized in Nigerian politics.  Aleiro </p><p>dismissed this as a "misperception of time and situation" </p><p>among certain groups in the North.  The North had ruled </p><p>Nigeria for a long time, and now had to accept that power </p><p>needed to be shared in the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador then asked if the Governor believed the </p><p>President might select another running-mate in the place of </p><p>Vice President Atiku Abubakar, such as Governor Makarfi of </p><p>Kaduna State.  Aleiro stated that a lot of influential </p><p>individuals were pushing Makarfi to challenge the Vice </p><p>President, but he did not believe Makarfi would do so. </p><p>(Makarfi, in fact, has publicly disavowed any intention of </p><p>challenging the VP.)  First, Atiku was a consummate </p><p>politician, and the President could not run a campaign </p><p>successfully without him.  The VP had huge political backing </p><p>from many within the PDP, formerly the People\'s Democratic </p><p>Movement, and was seen as the political successor of the late </p><p>Shehu Yusa Yar\'adua.  The VP was also extremely loyal to the </p><p>President.  Secondly, according to Aleiro, Makarfi had stated </p><p>both to the VP directly and to others that he would not </p><p>campaign for the VP\'s job.  According to Aleiro, Makarfi had </p><p>said he was not interested in the job as long as Atiku was in </p><p>it, and was more focused on continuing as governor in his </p><p>State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: Aleiro\'s comments were revealing.  It was a </p><p>surprise to hear a Northern Governor, and a member of the APP </p><p>party, unambiguously and strongly state his support for </p><p>President Obasanjo.  His criticisms, as well as his </p><p>compliments, of the present Administration were thoughtful, </p><p>and seemed to be an honest assessment.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
