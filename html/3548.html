<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001901 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, PHUM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP-DONOR MEETING:  MORE DOOM AND GLOOM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM REWhitehead due to 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  UNDP Resrep (and newly-named UN </p><p>Humanitarian Affairs Coordinator) to Zimbabwe Victor Angelo </p><p>met with donors on August 20 in a refreshingly frank session. </p><p> He listed upcoming events, including a proposed regional </p><p>scientific conference on GMO issues, and detailed where food </p><p>imports and agricultural production stand.  None of the news </p><p>was good.  Angelo announced a greater UN focus on monitoring </p><p>and a new UN and, allegedly, GOZ focus on displaced farm </p><p>workers.  Angelo stressed that he continues to press to no </p><p>avail through his increasingly frayed lines of communications </p><p>with the GOZ for rational responses on policy questions, and </p><p>he asked for donor advice on what next steps he should </p><p>consider.  There were comments from many donors about how </p><p>recent GOZ counter-sanctions could affect bilateral </p><p>humanitarian assistance programs.  We approached Angelo to </p><p>discuss the details of the GMO conference, including </p><p>potential pitfalls.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Where Things Stand, What Waits Ahead </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Just returned from his holidays, Angelo said that he </p><p>would re-engage Minister of Public Service, Labor and Social </p><p>Welfare July Moyo in discussions on food assistance later in </p><p>the week.  He described donor response to the humanitarian </p><p>food appeal as positive ) 43 percent of the total is </p><p>presently pledged ) but noted that the response to requests </p><p>for various health inputs (including drugs, foot and mouth </p><p>medicine, supplemental child feeding, and various non-food </p><p>commodities) has been anemic.  He said that from June 1 to </p><p>August 6 the GOZ had brought in 153,000 MT of maize and had </p><p>taken delivery of an additional consignment of 200,000 MT in </p><p>the port of East London.  He was skeptical about GOZ claims </p><p>that it will import 1,000,000 MT of maize during the calendar </p><p>year.  Angelo doubted that there will be sufficient forex  to </p><p>achieve this goal, despite GOZ exploration of ways to raise </p><p>additional forex, including taking advances on planned </p><p>exports and seizing the tobacco remaining on Section 8 farms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Angelo listed upcoming UN/UNDP events of interest. </p><p> </p><p> -- SADC health ministers will meet here next week to examine </p><p>the health dimensions of the regional crisis. </p><p> </p><p>-- UNSYG Special Envoy to the region for humanitarian </p><p>affairs, WFP Director James Morris, will visit in early </p><p>September and is tentatively scheduled to meet with Mugabe on </p><p>September 5. </p><p> </p><p>-- UNDP will host a September 8-11 Scientific Conference on </p><p>GMO issues that will bring together the GOZ Biosafety Board, </p><p>WHO, FAO, the GOZ Research Council, and representatives of </p><p>neighboring countries.  The GOZ is sponsoring the conference </p><p>that will bring in "top scientists" for informed policy </p><p>dialogue.  Angelo invited countries who wish to be involved </p><p>to contact him.  (See comment.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The next agenda item was the situation in the </p><p>agriculture sector.  Angelo presented a bleak picture, as </p><p>follows. </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOZ would need Zimbabwe dollar $70 billion </p><p>(approximately US $100 million at the parallel rate, and US </p><p>$1.27 million at the official exchange rate) to handle the </p><p>needs of the newly resettled; they have been able to mobilize </p><p>only $8.5 billion. </p><p> </p><p>-- There is sufficient maize seed in country, but price </p><p>controls are such that the seed companies are reluctant to </p><p>sell.  An increase in prices would put the seed out of reach </p><p>of many small farmers. </p><p> </p><p>-- There will be at least a 200,000 MT shortfall of </p><p>fertilizer, since there is no forex available to import the </p><p>raw materials. </p><p> </p><p>-- The most optimistic estimate for tobacco next year </p><p>foresees a minimum forty percent decline over the current </p><p>season,s already reduced output.  Hectarage planted will </p><p>fall from 60-65,000 hectares to 30,000. </p><p> </p><p>-- Only thirty percent of the recipients of A2 farms are </p><p>resident on the land and beginning to make preparations to </p><p>grow something next year.  The quality of their production </p><p>poses another unanswered question. </p><p>-- There is no reliable figure for smaller A1 resettled </p><p>farmers who have taken plots of varying sizes on 3,160 </p><p>sub-divided farms. </p><p> </p><p>-- Winter wheat cultivation was initially estimated at </p><p>100,000 MT produced on 20,000 hectares.  Recent farm </p><p>evictions will reduce this by probably fifty percent.  Some </p><p>farmers have arranged locally to harvest their wheat before </p><p>they are forced to leave; the GOZ plans to take over the </p><p>crops in other areas. </p><p> </p><p>Monitoring </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) During the agenda discussion of policy issues, the </p><p>question of food distribution monitoring arose.  The British </p><p>High Commissioner asked for a readout on the distribution </p><p>mechanism of the Grain Marketing Board (GMB), as opposed to </p><p>the WFP program.  A WFP representative said that the GMB sold </p><p>the subsidized grain/meal for cash, some of which was a </p><p>monthly Zimbabwe dollar $1,500 payment to families enrolled </p><p>in the government\'s food-for-work program on public works </p><p>projects.  (Angelo added that while the work had been done, </p><p>in many areas payment was behind schedule.)  The WFP </p><p>representative continued that WFP is targeting the most </p><p>vulnerable population with free food in 19 districts, which </p><p>WFP hopes to expand to 53 when sufficient resources are </p><p>available.  The DFID representative inquired about global </p><p>monitoring of all food distribution, noting that it was </p><p>essential the GMB distribution system as well as that of </p><p>donors be scrutinized in order to assist those who, for </p><p>whatever reason, do not benefit from the GMB sales. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Angelo responded that UNDP fully agrees.  He said </p><p>that he had repeatedly told senior GOZ  officials that the UN </p><p>would be watching, and that partisan distribution of food was </p><p>unacceptable.  He said that the GOZ reaction was that since </p><p>it was their money supplying the GMB operation, they would </p><p>distribute the food as they saw appropriate.  For this </p><p>reason, it would be necessary to monitor as closely as </p><p>possible food distribution on all levels.  Angelo did not </p><p>refer to the details of the monitoring mechanism. </p><p> </p><p>Commercial Farm Workers/Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Angelo expressed some optimism about the UN\'s </p><p>ability to address the plight of commercial farm workers. </p><p>After months of avoiding the issue, or rejecting it as </p><p>irrelevant, his GOZ contacts now seemed ready to discuss ways </p><p>forward, and the topic had come under discussion in the </p><p>GOZ-owned press.  Angelo said that the UN hopes to identify </p><p>as soon as possible qualified NGOs to undertake program </p><p>implementation with farm workers.  Angelo said that most farm </p><p>workers remained in place on their farms, although there was </p><p>a modest but growing migration toward communal and urban </p><p>areas.  As the Section 8 evictions go forward, the potential </p><p>for clashes between commercial farm workers and the new </p><p>settlers who have been allocated farm worker housing will </p><p>increase.  Angelo said that he had heard over the weekend </p><p>that the USG has offered to fund a senior OCHA official who </p><p>would work in Angelo\'s office, preferably by September 1, </p><p>with primary responsibility for farm worker/IDP issues. </p><p>(Request confirmation from the Department/USAID that this </p><p>information is accurate.) </p><p> </p><p>The Implications of  Counter Sanctions on Travelers for Donor </p><p>Implementation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The DFID representative observed that recent </p><p>developments at the Harare International Airport could </p><p>potentially pose problems for DFID activities, including </p><p>humanitarian programs, in Zimbabwe.  Fifteen non-UK national </p><p>DFID employees from countries as far away as Asia, and two UK </p><p>consultants, had been turned back by immigration authorities </p><p>without explanation on August 19.  They had come to undertake </p><p>a training session.  Most participants were from African </p><p>countries, and several held valid visas.  Angelo responded </p><p>that he had heard about such problems in passing and asked </p><p>what other nationalities had been affected.  Responses follow. </p><p> </p><p>-- Sweden:  Two students with visas were turned back on </p><p>August 19. </p><p> </p><p>-- UK:  Four additional persons had been turned back, </p><p>including a military officer who had come to wed his fiance, </p><p>a tourist, and a policeman who was told "wrong job" by the </p><p>immigration officer in charge. </p><p> </p><p>-- Germany:  Two persons, including a tourist holding a visa </p><p>and the sister of a permanent resident in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Netherlands:  A consultant with a local NGO who had </p><p>come to undertake an evaluation. </p><p> </p><p>-- Australia:  A recruiter for an Australian university who </p><p>had arrived from Nairobi to interview potential scholarship </p><p>candidates. </p><p> </p><p>-- USA:  Four Americans on August 15, including a woman </p><p>holding a valid visa who was interviewing to head an HIV/AIDs </p><p>project, a dance student with a valid visa, and a researcher </p><p>for an NIH-funded HIV/AIDS project who was bringing in </p><p>HIV/AIDs test kits.  (We have since heard that a fifth Amcit </p><p>(working for OXFAM) was turned back on August 19 and we are </p><p>seeking to confirm.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada:  Immigration officials attempted to turn back a </p><p>newly-arrived member of the Canadian High Commission with a </p><p>valid diplomatic visa, who eventually managed to talk his way </p><p>through. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Belgian Ambassador said that several EU nations, </p><p>including Belgium, have already issued travel advisories </p><p>warning business visitors as well as tourists that possession </p><p>of a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Zimbabwe, and </p><p>recommending against travel here.  The UK High Commissioner </p><p>reiterated that a continued refusal to grant entry to </p><p>official travelers could imperil British assistance programs </p><p>in Zimbabwe, including humanitarian programs.  Angelo replied </p><p>that he had urged the GOZ to approve registration of all </p><p>legitimate international NGOs interested in humanitarian </p><p>activities regardless of the location of their headquarters. </p><p>He requested details about any additional problems and said </p><p>that he would raise with Minister July Moyo this week the </p><p>urgency of rectifying this issue, and clarifying any new </p><p>procedures. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment: This particular meeting was different from </p><p>most donor conclaves in that it descended from the usual </p><p>platform of diplomatic niceties.  Angelo, who admitted that </p><p>he feels trapped "between the sword and the wall," was blunt </p><p>and offered nothing in the way of apologies for the GOZ </p><p>behavior or policies.  He said that his instructions from the </p><p>UNSYG are to "keep open the channels of communication," even </p><p>though little meaningful interchange appears to be moving </p><p>through those channels.  His view of the likely evolution of </p><p>events was as bleak as that of the rest of the participants. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  We approached Angelo after the meeting to request </p><p>further information on the Scientific Conference on GMO, </p><p>including who will be invited to present.  We reminded him of </p><p>the public debate-turned-debacle on GMO in Zambia and </p><p>cautioned that the event should be managed in such a way as </p><p>to avoid any negative fallout here and, by extension, </p><p>regionally.  Angelo offered to provide us full information on </p><p>the event at a meeting later this week, which we will share </p><p>with the Department.  Depending upon where this stands, we </p><p>may wish to identify additional participants who can offer </p><p>accurate, balanced and informed insights into the complex </p><p>biotech issue.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
