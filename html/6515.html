(C) The treason trial of Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC) officials Morgan Tsvangirai, Welshman Ncube, and Renson </p><p>Gasela, which entered its fifth week on March 10, took a step </p><p>forward with the completion of the questioning of Ari Ben- </p><p>Menashe, the state\'s star witness.  The pace of the trial </p><p>quickened considerably once the next witness, Ben-Menashe,s </p><p>personal assistant, Tara Thomas, took the stand.  At first, </p><p>her testimony seemed to favor the prosecution\'s case, but by </p><p>week\'s end it was difficult to tell which side was benefiting </p><p>from her testimony.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>No More Ben-Menashe </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On March 11, lead defense attorney George Bizos, </p><p>Deputy Attorney General Bharat Patel, and Presiding Judge </p><p>Garwe completed their questioning of the state\'s star </p><p>witness, Ari Ben-Menashe.  Bizos completed his </p><p>cross-examination on March 10, after asking Ben-Menashe final </p><p>questions about Dickens and Madson,s (D&M) amateurish </p><p>production of the videotape, requesting the original </p><p>videotape and some faxes, and objecting to Ben-Menashe </p><p>leaving the court without first submitting these pieces of </p><p>evidence.  Patel began the re-direct examination on March 10 </p><p>with questions about Ben-Menashe,s educational and </p><p>professional background, clearly trying to prove the </p><p>witness\'s competence to manage a political consulting firm. </p><p>He finished on March 11 asking questions about passages on </p><p>the videotape, the affidavit Ben-Menashe gave to the police, </p><p>Foreign Agents Registration Act registration, and what D&M </p><p>would be expected to do if hired by the MDC. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Witness Number 2: Tara Thomas </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On March 11, the state called its next witness, Tara </p><p>Thomas, personal assistant to Ben-Menashe.  Thomas appeared </p><p>to be a much better witness than Ben-Menashe.  She was </p><p>relaxed and respectful to the court, unlike Ben-Menashe. </p><p>During the direct examination, Thomas seemed composed and </p><p>tried to be as specific in her details as possible, although </p><p>she did often confused testimony several times.  Patel asked </p><p>Thomas about the audiotaped meeting with Tsvangirai in </p><p>England and the transcript of the meeting.  Patel went over </p><p>the second transcript of the Montreal meeting with her and </p><p>also reviewed the videotape. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On March 12, the defense brought a motion before the </p><p>judge to have Thomas view the videotape using a clean </p><p>transcript rather than the annotated one she had been using, </p><p>which appeared to have been guiding her testimony.  Garwe </p><p>upheld the defense objection and the prosecution had to find </p><p>a clean copy.  Patel asked her several speculative questions </p><p>about what she thought Alexander Legault, his business </p><p>partner, Ben-Menashe, and Morgan Tsvangirai were thinking or </p><p>meant to say.  Bizos objected that the witness could not </p><p>possibly know what the various speakers were thinking, but </p><p>his objections were overruled.  Thomas confirmed that the </p><p>transcript was not accurate because they could not understand </p><p>everything on the tape. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) On March 14, the defense began its cross examination. </p><p> During the cross-examination, Thomas contradicted some of </p><p>the evidence that had been given by Ben-Menashe.  Thomas </p><p>confirmed that a signed agreement between the MDC and </p><p>Ben-Menashe was legitimate, contrary to Ben-Menashe,s </p><p>testimony, and she contradicted Ben-Menashe on the number of </p><p>employees at D&M and what they do. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Interest Waning </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The courtroom was sparsely populated this past week. </p><p>The MDC mobilized a group of 30 or so female members aged 45 </p><p>to 60 to attend the trial to show support.  They were present </p><p>for at least two days.   If it weren\'t for these women, the </p><p>lower gallery would have been half full.  The upper gallery </p><p>was empty.  The press area had no more than 7 reporters </p><p>present on average. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Tara Thomas made for a refreshing change from </p><p>Ben-Menashe.  The pace of the trial picked up considerably </p><p>without the frequent adjournments caused by Ben-Menashe\'s </p><p>diatribes.  While Thomas was not necessarily more credible </p><p>than Ben-Menashe, she appeared much more calm and less </p><p>combative.  This could help create a sense that she is more </p><p>believable, regardless of the substance of her testimony. </p><p>The court continued to allow the prosecution\'s witness </p><p>unusual latitude and did not seem to be enforcing any </p><p>acknowledged rules of evidence.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
