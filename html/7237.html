<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002131 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 31 (4/08 1700 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2117 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  The Embassy is operating on a normal schedule April </p><p>8.  Consular services are open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center remain suspended, and there is only </p><p>restricted activity by FSNs at the Peace Corps office. </p><p>Movements of American staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S)  The Ambassador raised with Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher April 8 continued U.S. concerns over the unbalanced </p><p>coverage in the Jordanian media of events in Iraq (reftel). </p><p>The Ambassador cited for Muasher several examples of </p><p>factually incorrect coverage in the Jordanian media of </p><p>alleged coalition military actions, as well as examples of a </p><p>distinctly pro-Iraq slant in coverage that is otherwise </p><p>factually true.  He argued that such coverage only fans the </p><p>flames of anti-U.S. hatred and could make it more difficult </p><p>for the U.S. to sustain its important programs in the long </p><p>term. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The situation remains calm. Two small gatherings </p><p>planned for the evening of April 8: A pro-Iraq gathering </p><p>inside the Labor Complex in Irbid and a mid-afternoon </p><p>demonstration following prayers at the main Mosque in Salt. </p><p>Both are expected to be peaceful. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  On the heels of a strong performance Monday, the </p><p>Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) saw a slight drop-off in trading </p><p>but still closed up .86% on Tuesday.  Iraqi reconstruction </p><p>continued to be the focus of traders as they continued to buy </p><p>shares in industrial sector enterprises analysts believe are </p><p>well-placed to play a prominent post-war role. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  Two Iraqi refugees entered Jordan late on April 7. </p><p>They were temporarily admitted to the TCN transit camp but </p><p>are being moved to the UNHCR refugee camp this afternoon. </p><p>According to UNHCR, the two Iraqis hold valid documents and </p><p>tickets for onward travel to the UAE and wanted to join a </p><p>third family member in Amman before leaving for the UAE.  The </p><p>GOJ would not allow the Iraqis to stay temporarily in Amman </p><p>and instead offered either direct transfer to Queen Alia </p><p>airport or temporary accommodations in the refugee camp.  A </p><p>third Iraqi national with document problems is being held in </p><p>"no-man\'s land" at the border.  No TCNs crossed into Jordan </p><p>in the last 24 hours.  UNHCR reports that the border remains </p><p>open. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  Also late on April 7, the GOJ allowed all 22 </p><p>Palestinians who had been held at "no-man\'s land" to enter </p><p>the transit camp, bringing the total number of Palestinians </p><p>temporarily admitted to Jordan to 40.  In a related move, </p><p>local press reported that King Abdullah allowed 13 </p><p>Palestinians holding Iraqi or Egyptian travel documents to </p><p>move from the transit camp to Amman on April 7.  The 13 all </p><p>have direct family ties (spouses/children) to Jordanian </p><p>citizens and have been granted permission to stay only until </p><p>they are able to return to Iraq. </p><p>9. (U)  Fierce sandstorms overnight destroyed one Rubb Hall </p><p>at the UNHCR refugee camp and severely damaged two medical </p><p>tents at the JRCS transit camp.  At the request of IOM, </p><p>CARE/Australia is today setting up replacement Rubb Halls at </p><p>the transit camp.  In the meantime, UNHCR-implementing </p><p>partner Japan Platform is providing medical care at the </p><p>transit camp until JRCS can re-establish its medical </p><p>services.  Strong winds and sandstorms continue to buffet </p><p>Ruweished today; UNHCR reports that many TCNs are huddled in </p><p>IOM buses, hoping to wait out the poor weather. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  The April l8 killing of Al Jazeera journalist Tareq </p><p>Ayoub in Baghdad, allegedly during a coalition "rocket </p><p>attack," is the biggest story of the day.  Ayoub, a Jordanian </p><p>citizen, was well regarded and liked in both the journalist </p><p>and diplomatic community.  We anticipate harsh criticism and </p><p>anger from the press corps here, as Al Jazeera has claimed </p><p>the "coalition attack" on their office in Baghdad was </p><p>deliberate. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  On April 7 we held a press conference at the USAID </p><p>relief warehouse.  While the Jordan Times covered the </p><p>conference with a large article on page 3, the Arab language </p><p>papers ignored it.  Without mentioning the press conference, </p><p>an editorial by Nabil Shareef, editor of Al Destour, decried </p><p>the "hypocrisy" of humanitarian efforts at a time when the </p><p>"real issue" is stopping the massacre of Iraqi civilians. </p><p>The Arab media also carried articles critical of Jay Garner, </p><p>with many alleging his "close friendship" with Ariel Sharon. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
