<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000154 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEW DELHI PLEASE PASS TO SA/INS DIRECTOR DAVID GOOD FROM </p><p>CHARGE LEWIS AMSELEM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  01/28/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ECON, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Scenesetter for SA/INS Director Good\'s </p><p>upcoming visit to Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Lewis Amselem. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  We warmly welcome your upcoming visit. </p><p>It comes at an exciting time, with many of the positive </p><p>trends we discussed with you during your visit last fall </p><p>gaining increased traction.  A ceasefire has been in </p><p>place since December 2001, and the government and the </p><p>Tamil Tigers continue to hold constructive Norwegian- </p><p>facilitated talks.  The situation remains highly fluid, </p><p>however, with the intentions of the Tigers still </p><p>unclear.  The peace process could also be undermined by </p><p>domestic problems, such as cohabitation stresses and a </p><p>delicate economic situation.  This period remains one of </p><p>tremendous promise and your visit will help cement the </p><p>gains made in U.S.-Sri Lankan relations.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>Status of the Peace Process </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) We look forward to your February 4-7 visit to </p><p>Sri Lanka.  It comes at an exciting time.  As you know, </p><p>the United National Front (UNF) government led by Prime </p><p>Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has taken an activist </p><p>posture regarding the peace process since it assumed </p><p>power in December 2001.  In short order, the government </p><p>and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) re- </p><p>initiated the stalled Norwegian government facilitation </p><p>effort and put unilateral ceasefires into effect.  A </p><p>formal Norwegian-monitored ceasefire accord was signed </p><p>in February 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Continuing the positive trend, the two sides met </p><p>in Thailand in September 2002 for their first round of </p><p>peace talks since 1995.  Before the talks took place, </p><p>the GSL met the long-standing demand of the LTTE and </p><p>lifted its ban on the organization.  The LTTE, </p><p>subsequently, edged away from its long-standing demand </p><p>for a separate state.  Since September, the government </p><p>and the LTTE have held three more rounds of talks, most </p><p>recently in early January.  In addition, donor countries </p><p>met at a conference in Oslo in November 2002, with the </p><p>Deputy Secretary in attendance.  Japan is scheduled to </p><p>host another donors\' conference in June. </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>LTTE Intentions not clear </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Despite so much progress in so short a time, the </p><p>situation remains highly fluid, with the LTTE\'s long- </p><p>term commitment to the peace process in some question. </p><p>It is possible that the group may be using the peace </p><p>process as a test to see if it can get what it wants </p><p>(i.e., power in the north and east) without the </p><p>inconvenience of war.  Some of the LTTE\'s policy </p><p>pronouncements raise red flags, including its apparent </p><p>lack of interest in disarmament and demobilization.  The </p><p>forced recruitment of children is also a major human </p><p>rights issue.  There are signs of late that the LTTE is </p><p>also driving a harder bargain in the face-to-face talks. </p><p>Before and during the January talks, for example, the </p><p>group pressed hard for a reduction in the size of the </p><p>GSL\'s security zones in Jaffna.  Although the two sides </p><p>agreed to continue discussing the issue, a feeling is </p><p>developing that the talks are losing some of their </p><p>initial momentum.  All this said, the peace process is </p><p>moving forward; the pattern of LTTE activities do not </p><p>lead to blue sky optimism, however. </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>Cohabitation and Eastern problem </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Another factor that could unravel the peace </p><p>process is domestic opposition in the south.  While </p><p>playing to a small audience thus far, Sinhalese </p><p>chauvinists have engaged in rallies against the peace </p><p>process.  A potentially more ominous threat is President </p><p>Kumaratunga, who has sent mixed signals, at times </p><p>constructive, at times critical.  Kumaratunga\'s attitude </p><p>seems largely bound up in the cohabitation tensions that </p><p>flare between her and the government.  In addition to </p><p>the cohabitation problem, the Muslim community and the </p><p>LTTE share a tense relationship in the ethnically mixed </p><p>east, with communal violence a real possibility. </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>Economic Issues </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Another factor that could work to hurt the peace </p><p>process is Sri Lanka\'s economic situation, which is </p><p>quite delicate.  Although it has the most open economy </p><p>in South Asia and a relatively high per capita income </p><p>(USD 837), economic growth has been uneven and is mostly </p><p>confined to the greater Colombo region.  The UNF </p><p>government appears committed to putting the right </p><p>policies in place to re-ignite economic growth, but it </p><p>has moved haltingly.  If economic progress is not made, </p><p>opponents of the government could gain political </p><p>traction, a situation that could easily cascade to the </p><p>detriment of the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Meanwhile, our trade relationship with Sri </p><p>Lanka entered a new phase with the signing of a </p><p>bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement </p><p>(TIFA) in July 2002.  The first TIFA council meeting </p><p>took place in November during a visit to Sri Lanka by </p><p>Deputy USTR Ambassador Huntsman.  The U.S. intends to </p><p>use the TIFA process to improve the investment climate </p><p>here and win greater business for American firms. </p><p> </p><p>========== </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>========== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) This exciting period in Sri Lanka provides many </p><p>opportunities for the U.S.  Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe has worked hard to move closer to the </p><p>U.S. (e.g., he played a key role in the GSL\'s signing of </p><p>an ICC Article 98 non-surrender agreement in November). </p><p>Per the recent policy review, the U.S. has taken steps </p><p>to enhance its engagement with the GSL, and various USG </p><p>agencies have visited to review commercial, economic, </p><p>and defense issues.  Your visit will help underline </p><p>strong U.S. support for the peace process and our hope </p><p>for even closer bilateral ties. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) We suggest that you make the following key </p><p>points in your meetings with Sri Lankan officials: </p><p> </p><p>-- Express strong U.S. support for the peace process and </p><p>Norwegian facilitation. </p><p> </p><p>-- GSL needs to keep up momentum;  Sri Lanka is a vital </p><p>symbol of movement toward peace and stability in a </p><p>troubled South Asian region. </p><p> </p><p>-- All parties should work in national interest in </p><p>regard to the peace process and economic reform.  It is </p><p>important that peace process not falter because of </p><p>political infighting. </p><p> </p><p>-- Express appreciation to Sri Lanka for its support of </p><p>the global campaign against terrorism.  Review with </p><p>government our Iraq policy and our hope for Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>support in this vital area. </p><p> </p><p>-- Express appreciation to GSL for signing an ICC </p><p>Article 98 non-surrender agreement with U.S. and our </p><p>hope for even closer bilateral ties. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
