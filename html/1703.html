<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001133 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KISL, SOCI, EAID, NI, ASEC </p><p>SUBJECT: KANO HOTEL BURNED BY SHARI\'A ENFORCERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 762 (B) ABUJA 358 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Charge Tim Andrews for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: In a recent crackdown, the Government of </p><p>Kano State authorized the quasi-vigilante enforcement of the </p><p>State\'s new liquor law by sending the Deputy Governor, </p><p>accompanied by Hisbah members (Shari\'a enforcers) to five </p><p>hotels to enforce a ban on the sale or purchase of alcohol by </p><p>Muslims.  Some of the Hisbah became aggressive and broke </p><p>liquor bottles, then burned an Igbo hotel two nights later. </p><p>This action appears to have been an attempt by Governor </p><p>Kwankwaso to deflect criticism from Muslim leaders that the </p><p>State was not serious in its efforts to enforce Shari\'a. </p><p>Over 90 percent of Kwankwaso\'s constituents are Muslim, and </p><p>while many are concerned about Shari\'a implementation, none </p><p>feel free to openly criticize it.  Unfortunately, this action </p><p>has increased insecurity among the Igbo and Yoruba </p><p>communities in Kano, while unofficially sanctioning vigilante </p><p>action by Muslims.  The Governor assured Poloff that the </p><p>perpetrators of the arson have been arrested, and held </p><p>without bail.  He claimed they could not be brought to trial </p><p>without causing further protest by Muslims, and potential </p><p>unrest.  Governor Kwankwaso stopped short of admitting it, </p><p>but his control of Kano State appears to be steadily eroding. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Enforcing Shari\'a </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  During a two-day trip to Kano May 11 and 12, Poloff </p><p>met with law enforcement, religious, civil society and </p><p>Government leaders to verify reports of recent Hisbah </p><p>enforcement activities.  Nigerian media reported last month </p><p>that Deputy Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje led a group of </p><p>Hisbah Shari\'a enforcers and Nigerian Police to five of </p><p>Kano,s biggest hotels on April 14 to "order" them not to </p><p>sell alcohol.  During the raids, Hisbah enforcers broke </p><p>liquor and beer bottles and engaged in minor vanalism.  Two </p><p>days later, some Hisbah youths came back and burned down the </p><p>Henzino Hotel, a prominent Igbo/Yoruba social gathering </p><p>place.  Contrary to published reports, Deputy Commissioner of </p><p>Police Ezozue was not involved in any of these incidents.  He </p><p>said the Deputy Governor had not informed him or the </p><p>Commissioner prior to the raids on the hotels, and commented </p><p>on the "dangerous" precedent set by this action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Background </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  There are currently two groups of Hisbah enforcers in </p><p>Kano.  The official group, created in November, 2000, is led </p><p>by Sheikh Abubakar Ameen Al-Deen, reports to the Police and </p><p>co-ordinates its activities with the State Government. </p><p>Several months after the largely ceremonial "launching" of </p><p>Shari\'a last June, some Kano Muslims, impatient with the </p><p>Government\'s inaction, created their own independent Shari\'a </p><p>enforcement organization unaffiliated with State Government. </p><p>These groups overlap somewhat, but the Governor claims that </p><p>the unofficial Shari\'a enforcers were responsible for the </p><p>property damage to the hotels, and for the arson.  On April </p><p>7, Kano\'s Independent Shari\'a Committee, a group of Ulama who </p><p>are critical of the Governor,s handling of Shari\'a, gave </p><p>Kano authorities a one-week ultimatum to order hotels to stop </p><p>selling alcohol.  In response, Governor Kwankwaso said that </p><p>he ordered Deputy Governor Ganduje to make a symbolic </p><p>demonstration against the hotels and order them to stop </p><p>selling alcohol.  While State-sanctioned Hisbah enforcers and </p><p>a few police from the Government House guard-force </p><p>accompanied Ganduje, several rowdies from the independent </p><p>Hisbah took advantage of the opportunity to wreak havoc. </p><p>Fortunately, only liquor stocks were damaged on the 14th. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Governor Kwankwaso said that a group of the </p><p>Independent Hisbah returned on the 16th and burned the </p><p>Henzino Hotel.  He said the Hotel was located in a Muslim </p><p>residential neighborhood, and that there had been a long </p><p>history of conflicts with the neighbors, largely because the </p><p>Hotel was a large commercial establishment, surrounded by a </p><p>Hausa residential neighborhood.  He reported that his </p><p>intelligence on the incident indicated that some of the </p><p>Hotel\'s neighbors contacted the unofficial Hisbah, and asked </p><p>them to burn the Hotel.  The Governor said that he was </p><p>"gravely concerned" about the hotel-burning, and that six of </p><p>the perpetrators had been arrested.  He confided  that they </p><p>were being held by police without bail, but could not be </p><p>brought to trial at this time because of the potential for </p><p>protests by other Hisbah members and Shari\'a supporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Poloff observed that the new modus operandi for </p><p>hotels is that no liquor or beer bottles are left on the </p><p>tables.  Most nightclubs have closed, and the beer parlors in </p><p>Sabon Gari, the predominantly Christian/Southern neighborhood </p><p>of roughly 500,000 inhabitants, are being more discreet. </p><p>Kwankwaso said that the Government has no intention of </p><p>prohibiting alcohol sale or consumption by Christians, as </p><p>long as it is done with "discretion."  The unofficial policy </p><p>is now that alcohol may be served as long as bottles or cans </p><p>are not readily visible.  The Central Hotel, traditionally </p><p>one of Kano\'s busiest night-club venues, was nearly deserted </p><p>on a Friday night.  The burning of the Henzino has made other </p><p>Kano hotelliers understandably nervous, and they are now </p><p>reluctant to risk serving alcohol openly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment: Most people in Kano view this action as a </p><p>political move by the Deputy Governor to position himself for </p><p>the PDP gubernatorial nomination in 2003.  Ganduje has in </p><p>fact become much more popular than the Governor following the </p><p>raids, and his Abubakar Rimi-led faction of the PDP may </p><p>succeed in wresting the PDP nomination from Kwankwaso. </p><p>Kwankwaso is accurately viewed by his constituents as </p><p>reluctant to enforce Sharia, and his popularity has suffered. </p><p> It was not surprising, however, that Kwankwaso claimed to </p><p>have organized the D.G.\'s outing in order to "do something" </p><p>to appease Shari\'a supporters.  Aminu Wali, the President\'s </p><p>liaison to the National Assembly and a Kano political brahmin </p><p>with a profound knowledge of the intricacies of its politics, </p><p>confirmed to us that both Kwankwaso and the D.G. knew in </p><p>advance of the "raids."  In any event, Kwankwaso would not be </p><p>able to publicly criticize or reprimand his Deputy. </p><p>Enforcing the State\'s drinking laws through the Hisbah rather </p><p>than the National Police sets the rather unfortunate </p><p>precedent that Kano State permits vigilante Shari\'a </p><p>enforcement.  Given the fact that one hotel was burned </p><p>immediately after the raids, this policy may be very </p><p>difficult for civil authorities to reverse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  Comment Continued:  This incident has added </p><p>significantly to the existing tensions in Kano between </p><p>Northern and Southern ethnic groups.  Southerners took note </p><p>of the fact that the one hotel that was burned belonged to an </p><p>Igbo, and served as a central social meeting-place for Igbo </p><p>and Yoruba.  However, the fact that alcohol is still </p><p>available under the rather transparent "cover" of cups but no </p><p>bottles means that even ardent Shari\'a enforcers still have </p><p>their limits.  Post will follow with a broader analysis of </p><p>Shari,a and the security situation in Kano septel. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
