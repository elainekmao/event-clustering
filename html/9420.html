<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001996 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CA </p><p>SUBJECT:  CANADA\'S PROVINCIAL PREMIERS TAKE A STAND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Canadian premiers met for their annual </p><p>conference on July 9-11 at Charlottetown, Prince Edward </p><p>Island (PEI).  The tone was upbeat.  The premiers went </p><p>beyond the ritual criticism of federal heavy-handedness and </p><p>demands for more funding out of Ottawa and focused on ways </p><p>to make their collective voice better heard.  Their </p><p>frustration over the perceived domination by Ottawa of the </p><p>common agenda provided impetus for their proposal for a new </p><p>Council of the Federation, a regular gathering of the </p><p>provincial and territorial premiers to hammer out common </p><p>positions on the major shared issues facing the provinces </p><p>and territories.  The premiers, buoyed by the welcome </p><p>participation of the newly elected federalist Premier of </p><p>Quebec, Jean Charest, have taken an impressive first step </p><p>toward the establishment of a more balanced consensual joint </p><p>governance.  The GOC has not given the proposed Council much </p><p>consideration, as new leadership will soon take command and </p><p>have to deal with the challenge.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Canada\'s provincial and territorial premiers met July 9- </p><p>11 in Charlottetown, PEI, for their annual gathering. Three </p><p>main themes dominated the discussion:  provincial/federal co- </p><p>operation, the role of the premiers in Canadian-U.S. </p><p>relations, and a more equitable sharing of federal- </p><p>controlled resources in support of provincial </p><p>responsibilities.  The highlight was the group\'s attempt, </p><p>led by newly elected Quebec Premier Jean Charest, to inject </p><p>more provincial input into the national agenda, heretofore </p><p>largely dominated by the federal government.  The vehicle is </p><p>to be a newly created "Council of the Federation."  The goal </p><p>is to give the premiers a forum to discuss and hash out </p><p>common positions on key Canadian issues under their purview </p><p>and, as a result, reassert provincial prerogatives.  The </p><p>thirteen premiers will initially meet alone, excluding the </p><p>Prime Minister and the federal government until the Council </p><p>decides to invite them.  It is particularly noteworthy that </p><p>the impetus for this initiative was the newly elected Quebec </p><p>Premier, Jean Charest, a federalist without the anti-federal </p><p>baggage of some previous Quebecois premiers.  This </p><p>impressive display of national leadership from Quebec bodes </p><p>well for inter-provincial cooperation vis-a-vis Ottawa, </p><p>which has been impeded for at least the past decade by </p><p>Quebecois determined non-participation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Council intends, most basically, to improve federal </p><p>and provincial co-operation.  It is a renewed expression of </p><p>provincial strength and unity that may replace the annual </p><p>premiers\' meetings.  The exuberant premiers termed the </p><p>establishment of the Council (which, however, will not </p><p>require an amendment to the Canadian Constitution) as </p><p>approaching in importance the historic 1864 meeting in </p><p>Charlottetown, which set the basic outline for the creation </p><p>of the Canadian Confederation.  Despite the headlines, </p><p>however, it is very much a work in progress, and it is far </p><p>from clear what the Council will do for the ordinary </p><p>citizen.  The follow-up meeting of the premiers and </p><p>territorial leaders on October 24 in Quebec City will </p><p>indicate what kind of legs, if any, the Council has.  It </p><p>will meet perennially and likely have a small secretariat to </p><p>help organize the agenda, but will primarily serve the role </p><p>of a think-tank to help the premiers focus on and consult </p><p>over such issues as health care, inter-provincial trade, and </p><p>mobility rights. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The premiers also discussed their potential role in </p><p>Canadian-U.S. relations.  International affairs have not </p><p>fallen within provincial jurisdiction in the past, but they </p><p>argued that they can act as effective interlocutors with </p><p>their counterparts in the U.S. states.  The Canadian federal </p><p>government, they argue, could use help on the various issues </p><p>that affect the provinces and territories directly, such as </p><p>BSE-related embargoes of Canadian beef, softwood lumber, </p><p>pipeline construction, cross-border pollution, SARS, wheat </p><p>exports, and fisheries.  They contend the governors and </p><p>legislators, including Federal Senators and Congressmen from </p><p>U.S. states that have similar issues, would be more likely </p><p>to be receptive to their arguments than Washington. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The flow of funding from the federal government to the </p><p>provinces has been a constant source of friction. </p><p>Constitutionally, the federal government has greater tax </p><p>powers, but the provinces have the responsibility for </p><p>providing costly services such as roads, health insurance, </p><p>and education.  Typically, after such gatherings, the </p><p>meeting ended with a call for Ottawa to inject an already </p><p>promised C$3 billion into the healthcare system over the </p><p>next two years and to make good on federal promises to top </p><p>this up with some C$2 billion in surplus revenues projected </p><p>for the current year. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment:  To claim that the creation of the Council of </p><p>the Confederation will represent a serious challenge to </p><p>federal authority would greatly overstate the meaning of the </p><p>recent provincial premiers\' meeting.  However, Premier </p><p>Charest, throwing Quebec\'s newfound federalist weight into </p><p>the mix, has energized his provincial colleagues and has set </p><p>in train an interesting and potentially significant positive </p><p>development.  This fresh attempt to redefine federal- </p><p>provincial relations, while it may come too late to be </p><p>implemented by the outgoing Prime Minister, will pose his </p><p>successor with an interesting option.  Will he (or she) be </p><p>tempted to underplay this potential challenge to federal </p><p>authority, or be tempted to deal with it in a positive, </p><p>creative manner, one which might well lead toward a </p><p>constructive redefinition of the federal-provincial </p><p>partnership?  Prime Minister Chretien has not responded to </p><p>the proposed Council of the Federation; however, Liberal </p><p>Party leader Paul Martin, the suspected future PM, continues </p><p>to give this proposal thoughtful consideration. </p><p></p></div>
