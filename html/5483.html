<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 000861 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY:  TREASURY VIEWS OF DOMESTIC DEBT </p><p>MARKET </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Good Demand in February 3 Auction </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On January 3, Turkish Treasury auctioned a </p><p>three-month T-bill to strong demand, selling TL 955 trillion </p><p>(on total bids of TL 1.8 quadrillion) at the annually </p><p>compounded rate of 47 percent.  Note:  This was a quarterly </p><p>"reference rate auction," used to determine the interest </p><p>rates for quarterly coupons on Treasury\'s floating rate </p><p>notes.  The amount sold at such auctions is fixed at 15 </p><p>percent of the related month\'s domestic debt redemptions, and </p><p>the rates are generally well under the prevailing market </p><p>rates on longer term bills. End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Higher than Expected January Inflation - </p><p>But Likely Limited Effect on Feb 4 Auctions </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On February 3, the State Statistics Institute </p><p>released January inflation:  CPI came in slightly under </p><p>market expectations at 2.6 percent; but WPI was much higher </p><p>at 5.6 percent.  Istanbul market analyst Murat Ucer </p><p>attributes three factors to the WPI rate:  the usual </p><p>mid-winter jump in agricultural prices; a long-delayed rise </p><p>in state-controlled prices, especially in energy; and </p><p>exchange rate pass-through, given the lira\'s 6 percent </p><p>depreciation in January. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment: Several market participants told us they </p><p>don\'t believe the financial markets will react strongly to </p><p>the January inflation results.  JP Morgan/Chase treasurer </p><p>Sinan Gumisdis sees a limited effect on tomorrow\'s auctions - </p><p>i.e., 58 percent annually compounded rather than 57 percent. </p><p>Our contacts believe the February 4 auctions will find </p><p>sufficient demand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Treasury: To Continue Debt Roll-overs </p><p>into March, GOT Needs to Reduce Uncertainties </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Treasury Deputy DG for Public Finance Volkan Taski </p><p>was fairly confident Feb. 3 about Treasury\'s ability to </p><p>roll-over the debt this week.  Treasury plans to auction a </p><p>five-month bill and one-year bond on February 4, and targets </p><p>a total of TL 4 quadrillion (about $2.4 billion).   Taskin </p><p>told us two public institutions (the Unemployment Fund and </p><p>the Central Bank\'s Employee Pension Fund) have already agreed </p><p>to roll-over their debt, adding up to TL 1 quad, with the </p><p>other TL 3 quad to come from the market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Taskin told us Treasury\'s main focus is to </p><p>maintain strong demand, rather than to keep rates low, in the </p><p>current climate of market uncertainty.  T-bill investments at </p><p>57-58 percent give a higher yield than the overnight money </p><p>market (about 54 percent in annual compounded terms). </p><p>Nevertheless, there is now about TL 11 quadrillion in </p><p>liquidity sitting in the lira overnight market, Taskin </p><p>continued, a testament to investors\' concerns about the </p><p>maturity risks of holding T-bills.   A decrease in </p><p>uncertainty will bring some of this overnight liquidity in to </p><p>the T-bill market, he believes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) A decrease in uncertainty would also unlock some </p><p>additional foreign demand.  There is limited foreign interest </p><p>at present, mainly hedge funds attracted by the Turkish </p><p>T-bills nearly 30 percent real rate of return. Taskin\'s </p><p>figures show that in January only about TL 2.4 quad or 5.5 </p><p>percent of the TL 42 quad in marketable domestic debt stock </p><p>was held by foreign investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Looking to March, Taskin sees two big domestic debt </p><p>redemption dates:  March 5 (TL 3.9 quad or $2.4 billion to </p><p>the market); and March 19 (TL 4.0 quad).  To maintain the </p><p>current generally positive market sentiment into March, </p><p>Taskin believes the GOT needs to clear up relations with the </p><p>IMF.  Investors have largely priced in Turkey\'s cooperation </p><p>with the U.S. on Iraq, per Taskin. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
