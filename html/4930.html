<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000007 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, CA, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA\'S VIEWS ON PROPOSED U.S. TRIPS MORATORIUM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 265619 </p><p> </p><p>1. Post delivered reftel letter from USTR Zoellick to </p><p>Minister for International Trade Pettigrew, with copies to </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Graham and Minister of Health </p><p>McLellan.  On December 30, Suzanne Vinet, Director General </p><p>for Service, Investment and Intellectual Property at the </p><p>Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade called </p><p>to clarify some of the points in the letter. </p><p> </p><p>2. Vinet was interested in whether the letter was to Canada </p><p>only, and wondered if we were asking other countries for </p><p>support of the moratorium.  We explained that the letter had </p><p>been sent by Ambassador Zoellick to all his WTO counterparts. </p><p> Although we welcome support, we had only been asked to </p><p>provide host country reaction.  The Canadian embassy in </p><p>Washington had already seen the proposal on the USTR  website </p><p>and in "Inside US Trade."  We clarified that although the </p><p>proposal is public, it would not be formally presented to the </p><p>WTO until early January.  DG Vinet, who has only been in her </p><p>current job for two weeks and had not yet studied the </p><p>proposal, said she would consult within the GOC once </p><p>colleagues return from leave. </p><p>YOUNG </p><p></p></div>
