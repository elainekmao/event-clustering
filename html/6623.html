HARARE 515 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d. </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) There are credible reports that the GOZ has undertaken </p><p>a campaign of retribution against MDC activists and </p><p>supporters across the country since the first day of the </p><p>MDC-organized stayaway on March 18.  Police have arrested </p><p>over a hundred MDC supporters, and the Zimbabwean Defense </p><p>Forces (ZDF), ZRP, and ZANU-PF youths have beaten dozens of </p><p>perceived MDC supporters.  We anticipate that the GOZ may </p><p>continue to use the stayaway as an excuse to arrest </p><p>ever-higher MDC officials in the coming weeks.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Harare </p><p>------ </p><p>2. (U) By March 21, according to the MDC and independent </p><p>press, police in Harare had arrested over 100 suspected MDC </p><p>activists and supporters.  The government-owned The Herald </p><p>reported that only 53 people were arrested in Harare for </p><p>incidents relating to the mass action.  The MDC also reported </p><p>on March 21 that 83 supporters had sought medical help from </p><p>the MDC social welfare division, and had received vouchers </p><p>for medical services at a Harare hospital.  Other observers </p><p>reported seeing dozens of people seeking medical attention </p><p>for beating wounds at local clinics.  Military helicopters </p><p>were still patrolling the skies over Harare on March 21. </p><p> </p><p>Kadoma </p><p>------ </p><p>3. (U) On March 19, according to the official press and MDC </p><p>sources police in Kadoma arrested the MDC MP for Kadoma </p><p>Austin Mupandawana and about 33 MDC youths who were marching </p><p>in Kadoma with anti-Mugabe banners and placards.  The MDC </p><p>made efforts to contact Mupandawana and the youths; however, </p><p>they were apparently transferred to undisclosed police </p><p>stations and their whereabouts were still unknown as of March </p><p>21. </p><p> </p><p>Masvingo </p><p>-------- </p><p>4. (U) On March 18 police arrested and released on the same </p><p>day the MDC MP for Masvingo Central Silas Mangono with other </p><p>MDC youths in Masvingo.  Mangono was arrested and released </p><p>again on March 19. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) By March 21 the independent press and the MDC reported </p><p>that ZDF soldiers beat about 10 people in Masvingo in </p><p>incidents related to the stayaway.  On March 19 ZANU-PF </p><p>youths stoned and destroyed the house of the MDC provincial </p><p>chairman for Masvingo, Ms. Masekesa. </p><p> </p><p>Mutare </p><p>------ </p><p>6. (U) On March 19 according to the independent and official </p><p>press, and MDC sources, police arrested the MDC MP for Mutare </p><p>North and MDC Shadow Minister of Defense Giles Mutsekwa and </p><p>eight other MDC supporters.  Police accused Mutsekwa of </p><p>helping to organize the stayaway, at that point in its second </p><p>day, and questioned him about its planning.  He was still in </p><p>police custody on March 21. </p><p> </p><p>One Dead </p><p>-------- </p><p>7. (U) On March 18, suspected CIO officers abducted Steven </p><p>Tonera and two other workers from MDC MP for Chimanimani Roy </p><p>Bennett\'s commercial farm near Epworth (a suburb of Harare) </p><p>accusing them of burning a parastatal Zimbabwe United </p><p>Passenger Company (ZUPCO) bus earlier that day in Epworth. </p><p>All three were beaten severely, Tonera died during the </p><p>beating.  On March 19, 50-60 ZDF soldiers arrived at the farm </p><p>and beat 30 other workers, some severely, including a 55-year </p><p>old woman, with batons and batons covered with barbed wire. </p><p> </p><p>Other Areas </p><p>----------- </p><p>8. (U) By March 21 the independent and official press, and </p><p>the MDC, reported that police had arrested 18 people in </p><p>Gweru, and 13 in Bulawayo in incidents related to the </p><p>stayaway. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) By March 21, the MDC reported that police, ZANU-PF </p><p>youth, and ZDF soldiers had arrested, beaten, and destroyed </p><p>the homes of dozens of MDC provincial chairman, MDC </p><p>officials, lawyers, supporters and activists in the past </p><p>2-days, accusing them of helping to plan and carry out the </p><p>March 18-19 mass stayaway. </p><p>Comment: </p><p>10. (C) The GOZ appeared taken aback by the success of the </p><p>March 18 - 19 stayaway and now seems determined to exact </p><p>retribution from those responsible for organizing it.  The </p><p>Herald reported that police were moving in on the MDC </p><p>leadership who organized it, and we would anticipate that the </p><p>GOZ will continue to use the stayaway as an excuse to crack </p><p>down on ever higher MDC officials in the coming weeks, most </p><p>likely accusing them under the draconian Public Order and </p><p>Security Act, (POSA) of instigating public violence.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
