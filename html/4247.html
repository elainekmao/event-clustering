Sezer will wait for </p><p>the official announcement of poll results and for the oath </p><p>ceremony to decide about a new Prime Minister, papers say. </p><p>The two are expected to discuss the Cyprus problem, and </p><p>President Sezer will ask Erdogan and CHP leader Baykal to </p><p>make a joint statement about Cyprus, reports claim.  Dailies </p><p>note AKP officials were busy drafting formulas for </p><p>constitutional changes that would lift the political ban on </p><p>Erdogan.  If AKP fails to do so, Abdullah Gul will become </p><p>the Prime Minister, and Erdogan will become a super minister </p><p>with wide authority, "Cumhuriyet" claims.  Papers also </p><p>report an `action plan\' by AKP, which will reduce the number </p><p>of state ministries from 17 to 3, with a total of 23 </p><p>ministers in the cabinet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan, EU, Cyprus: Papers report that EU accession is the </p><p>top issue on the AKP agenda.  After receiving a briefing </p><p>from MFA on key international issues, Erdogan met with the </p><p>ambassadors of 15 EU countries on Wednesday evening. </p><p>Erdogan outlined for the EU envoys AKP priorities: ending </p><p>torture, ensuring freedom of expression, scrapping </p><p>investigations against religious foundations, and </p><p>implemention of regulations on Kurdish language broadcasts </p><p>and education.  The EU ambassadors voiced optimism after </p><p>meeting Erdogan, and EU Turkey representative Ambassador </p><p>Kretschmer issued a statement of cooperation, papers say. </p><p>Erdogan is expected to visit the Turkish Republic of </p><p>Northern Cyprus on November 15 before going to Athens on </p><p>November 18.  After the MFA briefed Erdogan and his staff on </p><p>Wednesday, the AKP official for foreign relations, retired </p><p>ambassador Yasar Yakis, said the Belgian model could not be </p><p>applied in Cyprus.  "Radikal" believes AKP was forced by the </p><p>MFA to make `adjustments\' to its earlier remarks on Cyprus. </p><p>MFA Spokesman Buluc said on Wednesday that Turkey was </p><p>against  the Belgian model for Cyprus, and that Ankara </p><p>supported the views of Denktas.  MFA officials will </p><p>accompany Erdogan on his visit to Greece, even tough MFA </p><p>Spokesman Buluc has said Erdogan would go there as party </p><p>leader, not as a representative of Turkey, "Radikal" adds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>General Ozkok in U.S.: Dailies report that TGS Chief General </p><p>Ozkok has started a tour of U.S. military facilities after </p><p>meeting with Vive President Cheney, National Security </p><p>Advisor Rice and Secreatary Powell the other day.  A senior </p><p>U.S. official is quoted as saying that the Americans were </p><p>impressed by Gen. Ozkok\'s determination regarding Turkey\'s </p><p>integration with the EU and Turkey\'s place in the West.  The </p><p>official reportedly said the U.S. has not yet made a </p><p>decision on Iraq.  Papers claim the U.S. has prepared a </p><p>financial support package for Turkey, and is confident that </p><p>Ankara will support a possible action against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. wraps up aid package for Turkey: Papers and </p><p>broadcasters report the U.S. Congress was busy preparing a </p><p>package of direct and indirect military and economic aid for </p><p>Turkey.  Sources close to the Washington Administration </p><p>reportedly said the package would amount to $4-6 billion. </p><p>Reuters reported that the U.S. Eximbank might extend a $4.2 </p><p>billion military loan to Turkey.  However, legal obstacles </p><p>must be lifted to enable  Eximbank to extend credit for </p><p>military sales, reports note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Turkish Elections </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The West and the AKP" </p><p>Hadi Uluengin wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (11/7): "The AKP </p><p>has an enormous chance because its government is going to </p><p>take charge with significant support from the Western, </p><p>Christian if you will, world.  . The Copenhagen summit is </p><p>likely to set a date for Turkey unless AKP makes a crucial </p><p>mistake.  The EU, contrary to common opinion, will not </p><p>pursue a completely negative attitude against the AKP.  On </p><p>the contrary, Turkey will be treated with more care because </p><p>it might serve as an alternative model to the conflict of </p><p>civilizations.  Therefore, the results of November 3 provide </p><p>a historic chance to the AKP which could benefit both Turkey </p><p>and all of humanity." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Cast Aside the Old Molds" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in mass appeal/sensational Posta </p><p>(11/7): "The AKP will not be able to change the secular </p><p>system.  If and when they attempt any such thing, we would </p><p>confront them, defending the system.  . We should act with </p><p>self-confidence and try not to live in fear.  If these guys </p><p>have bad intentions, if they want to deceive us, we will </p><p>find that out soon enough. . As ANAP did in 1993, AKP will </p><p>now start drawing the line it is going to follow.  This is </p><p>because they know that the pro-Islamic votes do not amount </p><p>to more than 10 to 15 percent, that a large part of the </p><p>votes they received came from different directions. Will </p><p>they want to be a party of the center and rule the country </p><p>for years?  Or will they take a radical stance, unable to </p><p>withstand the pro-Islamic pressure exerted by a minority </p><p>that forms part of their grassroots?  If they choose the </p><p>second path, they will end up as losers." </p><p></p></div>
