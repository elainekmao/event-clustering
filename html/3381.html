(C) SUMMARY. FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL DIOUF IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>SEND A LETTER TO UN UNDERSECRETARY OSHIMA CORRECTING HIS </p><p>PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE AND STATING THAT THE CARTAGENA </p><p>PROTOCOL DOES NOT STIPULATE MILLING OF GM COMMODITIES TO </p><p>PREVENT PLANTING.  COPIES OF THE CORRESPONDENCE SHOULD BE </p><p>SENT TO SOUTHERN AFRICAN FAO REPS AS WELL. WHILE FAO </p><p>RECOGNIZES THAT IT MADE A FACTUAL ERROR IN THE ORIGINAL </p><p>CORRESPONDENCE, THE PRIMARY FAO CONCERN (AS EXPRESSED BY FAO </p><p>DEPUTY HARCHARIK) IS THAT IT IS BEING "UNFAIRLY SCAPEGOATED" </p><p>IN THIS MATTER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) ALTERNATE PERM REP AND HUMANITARIAN ATTACHE </p><p>DISCUSSED REFTEL (A) DEMARCHE WITH THE FAO\'S DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL, DAVID HARCHARIK, ON MONDAY JULY 22.  WE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE FAO WAS APPARENTLY PROVIDING INCORRECT RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL AND </p><p>THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE DISASTROUS IMPLICATIONS IN </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA.  HARCHARIK WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER </p><p>BUT PROMISED TO LOOK INTO IT IMMEDIATELY. </p><p> </p><p>THE FAO RESPONSE </p><p>---------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03676  01 OF 02  262053Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ALTERNATE PERM REP FOLLOWED-UP WITH HARCHARIK BY </p><p>PHONE ON 7/23, 7/24 AND 7/25. AS OF THE LAST CONVERSATION, </p><p>THE SITUATION IS AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE FAO RECOGNIZES THAT THE LETTER TO UN UNDERSECRETARY </p><p>OSHIMA WAS INCORRECT. </p><p> </p><p>-- A NEW LETTER WILL BE TRANSMITTED SHORTLY TO UNDERSECRETARY </p><p>OSHIMA.  WE UNDERSTAND THE LETTER WILL SAY, IN REFERENCE TO </p><p>THE FAO\'S PREVIOUS LETTER, THAT THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL DOES </p><p>NOT STIPULATE MILLING OR ADVANCE INFORMED AGREEMENT (AIA) FOR </p><p>FOOD OR FEED. HOWEVER, (PER HARCHARIK), THE LETTER WILL NOT </p><p>SAY THAT "GMO\'S ARE SAFE" OR "NOT SAFE" BUT WILL REFER TO THE </p><p>PREVIOUS LETTER\'S STATEMENT THAT THE "PREVAILING SCIENTIFIC </p><p>OPINION IS THAT THEY ARE AS SAFE AS THEIR CONVENTIONAL </p><p>COUNTERPARTS." THE LETTER MAY GO OUT LATE TODAY OR TOMORROW </p><p>(FRIDAY 7/26). </p><p> </p><p>-- A COPY OF THE LETTER SHOULD BE SENT TO THE FAO COUNTRY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>-- ALTHOUGH EXPLICITLY ASKED, HARCHARIK WOULD NOT AGREE TO </p><p>SHARE THE NEW LETTER WITH THE MISSION SO WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT </p><p>THE EXACT CONTENTS WILL BE. HARCHARIK STATED THAT THE LETTER </p><p>HAS BEEN DELAYED IN PART BECAUSE "DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) DIOUF </p><p>WANTS TO ADD SOME OTHER THINGS." (THE DG IS CURRENTLY IN </p><p>SENEGAL.) </p><p> </p><p>THE FAO GRIPE </p><p>------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03676  01 OF 02  262053Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  HARCHARIK\'S BIGGEST CONCERN, HOWEVER, WAS THAT THE </p><p>FAO WAS BEING "SCAPEGOATED" IN THIS AFFAIR.  HARCHARIK NOTED </p><p>THAT THE ORIGINAL REQUEST FROM OSHIMA WAS FOR UN AGENCY INPUT </p><p>IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A COMMON UN POLICY. IN FACT, NO UN POLICY </p><p>HAD EMERGED FROM OSHIMA, AND, ACCORDING TO HARCHARIK, "LEAKED </p><p>FAO LETTERS" WERE BEING USED TO "UNFAIRLY IDENTIFY FAO AS THE </p><p>CULPRIT." </p><p> </p><p>FAO IN THE FIELD (MAPUTO) </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ALTERNATE PERM REP RESPONDED THAT THE REAL PROBLEM </p><p>WAS NOT WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN NEW YORK, BUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING </p><p>IN THE FIELD, AND PARTICULARLY THE ROLE OF THE FAO </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES AND THE ADVICE THAT THEY WERE PROVIDING TO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS.  IN THIS CONNECTION HARCHARIK MENTIONED THAT HE </p><p>HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE FAO REP IN MAPUTO, MR. PETER </p><p>VANDOR, WHO APPARENTLY "WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS TO SAY." </p><p>HARCHARIK REPORTED THAT HE HAD HAD TOLD VANDOR TO "HOLD OFF," </p><p>BUT ADDED THAT VANDOR HAD ASSURED HIM THAT: </p><p> </p><p>1) THERE WAS SUFFICIENT MILLING CAPACITY IN MOZAMBIQUE AND </p><p> </p><p>2) THAT WFP HAD "DEFERRED" TO THE FAO IN THIS MATTER IN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5366 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03676  02 OF 02  262054Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   COME-00  CTME-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     TEDE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /004W </p><p>                  ------------------D0DF23  262054Z /21 </p><p>R 251357Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5091 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY DAR ES SALAAM </p><p>AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003676 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA HAYMOND AND JOHNSON, EB/KLEMM AND HAUSER </p><p>STATE PASS TO USDA FAS WASHDC </p><p>OES/ETC FOR DRISCOLL AND FOSTER </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/HUGUES, APHIS DUNAHAY </p><p>USAID FOR JOSETTE LEWIS </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2007 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03676  02 OF 02  262054Z </p><p>TAGS: AORC, FAO, WFP, ETRD, EAGR, EAID, MZ </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON GMO FOOD AID </p><p> </p><p>MAPUTO. </p><p> </p><p>WFP ACTION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.

LAVELLE QUOTED TO LEWIS </p><p>THE WFP\'S JUNE 28 LETTER TO OSHIMA ON THIS MATTER WHICH </p><p>STATED "THE UN SHOULD NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PROMOTE THE </p><p>IDEA THAT ALL GM COMMODITIES IMPORTED EITHER COMMERCIALLY OR </p><p>AS FOOD AID NEED TO BE MILLED.  MILLING SHOULD BE TREATED </p><p>ONLY AS AN OPTION FOR GOVERNMENTS WHICH PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON </p><p>GM FOOD IMPORTS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) HUMANITARIAN ATTACHE SUGGESTED THAT THE WFP EXECUTIVE </p><p>DIRECTOR, JAMES MORRIS CALL FAO DG DIOUF AND RECOMMEND THAT </p><p>FAO OFFICERS THROUGH SOUTHERN AFRICA ADOPT A "MUTED" STANCE </p><p>ON GM MATTERS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p>8.

IN THIS REGARD WE NOTE THAT THE UNSYG </p><p>ANNAN APPOINTED ON JULY 23 WFP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MORRIS AS </p><p>HIS SPECIAL ENVOY ON THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AFRICA. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03676  02 OF 02  262054Z </p><p>TAMLYN </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03676 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
