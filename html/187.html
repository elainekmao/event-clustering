<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 034351 </p><p> </p><p>FOR AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NG, MR </p><p>SUBJECT: LIBYA: THE VIEW FROM QADHAFI\'S BACK PORCH </p><p> </p><p>1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF STATE 14270 TO CAIRO (DATED </p><p>JANUARY 16, 1988) REPEATED FOR YOUR INFO.  BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  QADHAFI IS MAKING SOLID GAINS IN THE MAGHREB.  HIS </p><p>RAPPROCHMENT WITH ALGERIA IS BEARING FRUIT--THOUGH NOT YET </p><p>THE FULL-BLOWN UNION HE IS SEEKING.  THE PROCESSION OF CHAD </p><p>DEFEATS HAS ENDED; AND HE IS SLOWLY STRENGTHENING HIS LINKS </p><p>WITH NEIGHBORING AFRICAN STATES.  AS A RESULT, HIS </p><p>SELF-CONFIDENCE IS RISING, AND WE EXPECT HIM GRADUALLY TO </p><p>SHIFT TO A HIGHER PROFILE STANCE IN COMING MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>MAGHREB THE JEWEL IN THE GROWN? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>4.  (C)  QADHAFI CONTINUES TO DIGEST THE LESSONS HE LEARNED </p><p>FROM OUR AIRSTRIKE IN 1986.  HE CANNOT COUNT ON OUTSIDE </p><p>SUPPORT IF HE GETS IN DIFFICULTY BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN TO OUT </p><p>OF STEP WITH HIS FELLOW ARABS.  TO REMEDY THIS WEAKNESS IN </p><p>HIS POSITION, HE HAS BEEN EAGERLY RESPONDING TO ALGERIAN </p><p>OVERTURES FOR HALF A YEAR.  WHILE HE HAS ON OCCASION </p><p>STARTLED THE ALGERIANS WITH TOO AVID A COURTSHIP--HE HAS </p><p>SETTLED INTO MORE DURABLE STEPBY-STEP MILITARY, BUSINESS </p><p>AND "PARLIAMENTARY" EXCHANGES.  HE HAS MET ALGERIA\'S </p><p>INSISTENCE THAT HE RENEW RELATIONS WITH TUNISIA.  HE MAY </p><p>EVEN HAVE ARRESTED THE EROSION OF RELATIONS WITH MOROCCO BY </p><p>MONEY AS WELL AS WORDS CRITICAL OF THE POLISARIO. </p><p> </p><p>------------"--------- </p><p>FRIENDSHIP ON THE DOTTED LINE </p><p>---------"------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  IF QADHAFI ACCEDES TO ALGERIA\'S SECOND </p><p>CONDITION"LIBYAN MEMBERSHIP IN THE TRIPARTITE ACCORD OF </p><p>1983 WHICH ENSURED (PAPER) CORDIALITY BETWEEN ALGERIA, </p><p>MAURITANIA, AND TUNISIA--HE WILL GET APPLAUSE FROM LIBYANS </p><p>AND , THAT MOST ELUSIVE OF GOALS, LEGITIMACY IN THE </p><p>REGION.  QADHAFI LOVES SIGNED STATEMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP, </p><p>ALMOST AS MUCH AS "UNION" PACTS; HE WILL ACCEPT HALF A LOAF </p><p>BY JOINING THE MAGHREB CLUB, RELISHING ITS PROPAGANDA VALUE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY EXPLOIT HIS NEW ROLE TO TAUNT </p><p>THE US, WHICH GIVES HIM CLOUT WITH SOME ARABS WHILE </p><p>DISMAYING HIS OLD ENEMY, EGYPT.  HE WILL CERTAINLY USE THE </p><p>RELAXATION OF VISA RESTRICTIONS FOR ITS INTELLIGENCE VALUE </p><p>OF HAVING UNDERCLARED AGENTS ON THE GROUND IN TUNIS, </p><p>NOUAKCHOTT, AND ALGIERS.  ECONOMICALLY, HE MAY SUGGEST </p><p>"JOINT VENTURES" WITH HIS NEWFOUND PARTNERS, WHICH COULD </p><p>AFFECT CURRENT US BUSINESS VENTURES WITH MAGHREB STATES, OR </p><p>GIVE HIM ACCESS TO US TECHNOLOGY.  EVERYONE ELSE IN THE </p><p>ACCORD IS CASH-POOR AND OPEN TO LIBYAN LARGESSE.  QADHAFI </p><p>MAY ALSO BE LOOKING AT SECURITY IMPLICATION, I.E. TURNING </p><p>ANY FUTURE US THREATS OF HOSTILE ACTION AGAINST HIM INTO </p><p>"THREATS AGAINST THE ACCORD" </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>QUIET ALONG THE SOUTHERN FLANK </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MEANWHILE, QADHAFI\'S DIPLOMATS ARE PLAYING A </p><p>WAITING GAME WITH THE OAU ON CHAD.  THE LONGER THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS OVER WHO OWNS HOZOU ARE DRAGGED OUT, THE </p><p>FIRMER ARE LIBYAN SOUTHERN DEFENCES AGAINST HABRE\'S </p><p>WARRIORS.  LIBYAN ENVOYS TO NIGER HAVE PROMISED TO MAKE </p><p>GOOD SOME 1973 URANIUM DEBTS, PROBABLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>FACILITATE ACCESS TO THE CHADIAN FRONT.  LIKEWISE IN SUDAN, </p><p>QADHAFI CONTINUES TO PLY SADIQ-AL-MAHDI WITH GOODIE BAGS OF </p><p>ARMS, MEDICINE, AND AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT--MEANWHILE </p><p>CONTINUING TO SEND LIBYANBACKED MERCENARIES IN THE </p><p>TRACKLESS CORNER OF SUDAN NEAR CHAD.  IN UGANDA, QADHAFI </p><p>EXPLOITS A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH MUSEVENI, KEEPING </p><p>MILITARY HARDWARE AND TRAINING FLOWING--OR DID UNTIL LAST </p><p>WEEK WHEN SOME UGANDANS, UPSET ABOUT TOO CLOSE AN EMBRACE, </p><p>KILLED A LIBYAN OPERATIVE.  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>SHULTZ </p><p></p></div>
