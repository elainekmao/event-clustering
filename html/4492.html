<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006878 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECSTATE FOR NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KPAO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN REACTION TO AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE AND </p><p>PEACE CORPS DEPARTURE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Haynes Mahoney, PAO, Reason 1.5 b and d </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary.  Jordanian official and public reactions to </p><p>the announcement of authorized departure and the departure of </p><p>the Peace Corps are mixed.  While GOJ leaders and many </p><p>businessmen express regret but "understanding" for the </p><p>decisions, the columnists and some of our contacts say they </p><p>are confused, suspicious and resentful over a move which they </p><p>believe will undermine Jordan\'s reputation as a safe place </p><p>for tourism and business.  "Do you know what you\'re doing to </p><p>Jordan?" one journalist contact asked angrily, predicting </p><p>that the already troubled economy would take more hits and </p><p>for no good reason.  Foreign Minister Muasher and Information </p><p>Minister Adwan tried to minimize the impact, stressing that </p><p>the departure policy is voluntary and limited in scope and </p><p>predicting that the Peace Corps\' absence is temporary. </p><p>Ambassador Gnehm plans to clarify misunderstandings about the </p><p>nature of the decisions when he speaks to Jordan\'s Petra News </p><p>Agency today.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Official Reaction:  What You Had To Do </p><p>Senior officials up to King Abdullah (septel) expressed </p><p>regret over the conditions behind the authorized departure </p><p>decision and the temporary removal of the Peace Corps, and </p><p>repeated their assurance that the GOJ would do everything it </p><p>could to ensure the security of Embassy personnel and other </p><p>American citizens.  Nevertheless, they said they understood </p><p>our responsibility to make hard choices to protect the lives </p><p>of American citizens.  "You must do what you have to do," one </p><p>senior GOJ official told the Ambassador.  The head of </p><p>Jordan\'s security apparatus, the Public Security Division, </p><p>told emboffs that he was regretful but "relieved" over the </p><p>departure of the Peace Corps volunteers, whose locations </p><p>among poor communities scattered throughout the country posed </p><p>special challenges. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Media Grumbling </p><p>Though all major papers have prominently reported the </p><p>authorized and Peace Corps departures, mainly drawing on the </p><p>Foreign and Information Ministers\' statements, press </p><p>commentary has been limited but critical. One column called </p><p>the departure policies "baseless and unjustifiable," stating </p><p>that by exaggerating threats to Americans the U.S. was taking </p><p>away with one hand the considerable aid it gives with the </p><p>other, and blaming this paradox on unidentified "elements in </p><p>the U.S. administration" with an anti-Jordanian agenda. </p><p>Another columnist complained that the measure was hurting </p><p>Jordan\'s trade and investment climate even before the </p><p>expected war in Iraq.  Both commentaries echoed the </p><p>Information Minister\'s message that Jordan is one of "the </p><p>safest places on earth." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Anxiety Levels Up, Though Businessmen Calm </p><p>Our FSNs received numerous calls over the weekend following </p><p>the authorized departure announcement in Washington, asking </p><p>whether all Americans were evacuating Jordan, and whether </p><p>this step was the first move in the anticipated Iraq war. </p><p>Our explanation that the departures are voluntary, limited in </p><p>time and would not interfere with routine Mission services </p><p>seemed to calm people somewhat though there is still a </p><p>considerable amount of anxiety and resentment over these </p><p>highly publicized events.  With reports of renewed violence </p><p>in the southern town of Ma\'an, Jordanians feel that the </p><p>departure of diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers will not </p><p>enhance their country\'s reputation or stability.  However a </p><p>quick, informal poll of businessmen shows that most do not </p><p>believe the decisions will have a significant impact on their </p><p>business. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: </p><p>Most of our contacts assumed from first reports that the </p><p>decision would lead to a large drawdown of staff and a </p><p>reduction of programs.  As it becomes clear that this is not </p><p>the case, we expect that the anxiety over the decision will </p><p>lessen considerably. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
