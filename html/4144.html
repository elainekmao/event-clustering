<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 005346 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE MENNUTI, IO/ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: AORC, KSCA, PREL, VT, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON CLONING CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) STATE 209737 </p><p>     B. B) VATICAN 4241 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON.  REASON:  1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) EMBASSY APPROACHED HOLY SEE DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>MIGLIORE OCTOBER 25 TO REQUEST HOLY SEE DEMARCHES TO </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF ISLAMIC CONFERENCE (OIC) MEMBER STATES IN </p><p>ORDER TO SECURE BROADER SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.-SPONSORED </p><p>RESOLUTION BANNING ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING.  MIGLIORE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05346  311458Z </p><p>INDICATED HE WOULD CONSIDER THE U.S. PROPOSAL AND REQUESTED </p><p>DCM REVIEW ISSUE WITH HIM OCTOBER 29.  AT THAT MEETING, DCM </p><p>REITERATED THE U.S. VIEW THAT THE HOLY SEE MIGHT BE ABLE TO </p><p>REINFORCE OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD SUPPORT AMONG OIC COUNTRIES. </p><p>DCM NOTED THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S BELIEF THAT HUMAN CLONING </p><p>REPRESENTS AN ASSAULT ON HUMAN DIGNITY WOULD RESONATE WITH </p><p>OIC COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) MIGLIORE RESPONDED THAT THE HOLY SEE STRONGLY </p><p>SUPPORTED A COMPLETE BAN, AND WAS WORKING ACTIVELY TO ACHIEVE </p><p>IT.  HE INDICATED THAT THEY WERE LOBBYING ACTIVELY IN LATIN </p><p>AMERICA, AFRICA, AND EUROPE, AS WE HAD URGED IN AN EARLIER </p><p>APPROACH.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE CAUTIONED THAT THE HOLY SEE </p><p>CONTINUED TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN TO ALTERNATIVES SHORT OF A </p><p>TOTAL BAN, AS LONG AS THEY RESPECTED MORAL PRINCIPLES.  HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED, AS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY (REF B), THAT THE HOLY SEE </p><p>DID NOT WANT TO BE LEFT WITH NOTHING IN THE EVENT A TOTAL BAN </p><p>COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) REGARDING THE U.S. REQUEST FOR THE HOLY SEE TO </p><p>APPROACH OIC COUNTRIES, MIGLIORE SAID THE HOLY SEE BELIEVED </p><p>THAT THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN </p><p>BUILDING SUPPORT AMONG OIC COUNTRIES.  "WE CANNOT CREATE </p><p>SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A HOLY ALLIANCE," HE ASSERTED.  DCM </p><p>NOTED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD WORKED EFFECTIVELY WITH OIC </p><p>COUNTRIES IN 1994 AT THE UN POPULATION CONFERENCE IN CAIRO, </p><p>AND THAT WE BELIEVED SIMILAR MORAL ISSUES WERE AT STAKE IN </p><p>THIS CASE.  MIGLIORE INSISTED THAT THIS CASE WAS DIFFERENT </p><p>THAN 1994 BECAUSE AT THAT TIME THERE HAD BEEN TREMENDOUS TIME </p><p>PRESSURE.  IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS MORE TIME AND THERE WERE </p><p>BETTER OPTIONS ON THE TABLE.  PRESSED FURTHER, MIGLIORE SAID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05346  311458Z </p><p>THE HOLY SEE HAD TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT ITS INTERNATIONAL IMAGE. </p><p> "WE DON\'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT OUR VIEWS AND </p><p>THOSE OF THE MUSLIM WORLD ARE ONE AND THE SAME." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) REGARDING THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY, MIGLIORE </p><p>ELABORATED ON THE HOLY SEE\'S PERSPECTIVE AND STRATEGY LEADING </p><p>UP TO WHAT THEY UNDERSTOOD WOULD BE A FEBRUARY VOTE ON THE </p><p>RESOLUTION.  INITIALLY, THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO LOBBY HARD FOR </p><p>A TOTAL BAN.  IF IT APPEARED THAT THE VOTES FOR SUCH A BAN </p><p>WOULD NOT BE THERE, THEY WOULD CONSIDER SUPPORTING A MODIFIED </p><p>FRENCH/GERMAN TEXT THAT RESPECTED MORAL PRINCIPLES.  SUCH A </p><p>TEXT: 1) MUST NOT CLOSE THE MANDATE OF THE COMMITTEE, WHICH </p><p>MUST BE ABLE TO REOPEN AND BROADEN; 2) MUST INCLUDE WORDING </p><p>TO MAKE CLEAR THAT AGREEMENT ON THE PARTIAL BAN DOES NOT </p><p>IMPLY APPROVAL OF THERAPEUTIC CLONING. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MIGLIORE SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS CONCERNED THAT AN </p><p>INCREASING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, INCLUDING JAPAN, CHINA, </p><p>SINGAPORE, AND THE UK WERE ALREADY USING THERAPEUTIC CLONING, </p><p>AND THAT THIS WAS BECOMING A REALITY THAT WOULD BE HARD TO </p><p>PUT BACK IN THE BOTTLE.  HE EXPECTED THAT THESE COUNTRIES </p><p>WOULD STRONGLY RESIST EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A TOTAL BAN. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05346 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
