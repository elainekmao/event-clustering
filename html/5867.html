<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/IP/SA AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, NP, Political Parties, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: LOCAL POLITICAL PARTIES STAGE ANTI-AMERICAN </p><p>PROTEST -- KATHMANDU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  On Tuesday, 18 February, a group of ten leftist political </p><p>parties staged an anti-American protest, culminating with the </p><p>delivery of a protest letter to the Embassy.  The crowd </p><p>numbered around 100.  Their slogans decried US war with Iraq </p><p>and North Korea, and US Imperialism.  The protest was </p><p>peaceful and short-lived.  It was consistent with past </p><p>protests against the USG, such as those that took place in </p><p>the aftermath of our bombing campaign in Afghanistan just </p><p>over a year ago. </p><p> </p><p>2.  As usual, Post received excellent support from the Nepal </p><p>Police assigned to control the protest.  The police contained </p><p>the protesters outside direct line of sight of the Embassy, </p><p>allowing only two of the groups\' representatives to come </p><p>forward and present their protest letter as agreed in advance </p><p>by Post. The protest took place without violence or other </p><p>incident. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
