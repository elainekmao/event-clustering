<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000855 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: USINT BAGHDAD PERSONNEL DEPART IRAQ; ARRIVE SAFELY </p><p>IN AMMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry. Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) All four Polish diplomats representing the U.S. </p><p>Interests Section in Baghdad (along with two spouses) </p><p>departed Iraq February 5 and have arrived safely in Amman. </p><p>They are scheduled to fly on to Warsaw on Sunday, February 9. </p><p> In a meeting with poloff February 6, USINT Baghdad chief </p><p>Krzysztof Bernacki recounted his staff\'s final tension-filled </p><p>week in the Iraqi capital and its culmination with a sunset </p><p>border crossing into Jordan the night before. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>The Sun Sets . . . For Now </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Bernacki said that he had been notified by the Polish </p><p>MFA on Thursday, January 30 that USINT\'s Polish staff should </p><p>depart Baghdad on February 5.  In the intervening week they </p><p>had been working long hours shredding documents, </p><p>disassembling equipment and packing official USG items as </p><p>well as their personal belongings.  He prepared a diplomatic </p><p>note that his local staff will deliver to the Iraqi MFA on </p><p>Saturday February 8 that will inform the GOI officially that </p><p>USINT has "suspended operations" effective that day.  He said </p><p>that he understood that the Department will announce this </p><p>publicly in Washington on 2/8 as well. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Bernacki said that neither he nor his Polish </p><p>colleagues had slept more than 3 hours per night since being </p><p>instructed to depart, both because of the amount of work they </p><p>had to do and the level of stress they were under (he noted </p><p>that he had lost more than 10 pounds during that time alone). </p><p> Until they crossed the border last night, they were unsure </p><p>whether the Iraqis would let them out or not. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The USINT convoy (4 vehicles all driven by the Poles </p><p>themselves) had planned to depart Baghdad early morning </p><p>February 5 in order to ensure that they would arrive in Amman </p><p>by sundown.  However, at 2200 on February 4, Bernacki said </p><p>that he "received an encrypted message" asking him to obtain </p><p>the GPS coordinates for a number of Foreign Embassies in </p><p>Baghdad.  In order to carry out this final task, he had to </p><p>delay his own departure "by a few hours" while he collected </p><p>that information (which he passed on to our DAO).  The rest </p><p>of the convoy had departed the center of Baghdad without him </p><p>and waited at the checkpoint on the outskirts of the city </p><p>until he rejoined them.  From that point on, he said that the </p><p>drive to the border was uneventful.  Traffic was light and </p><p>they saw very few military vehicles. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The convoy arrived at the Iraqi side of the border </p><p>(which was empty of other travelers) at approximately 1630 </p><p>where he noticed "a lot of mukhabarat (secret police) </p><p>observing us.  Clearly they knew who we were and that we were </p><p>all leaving."  Bernacki said that he believed the reason they </p><p>were not hassled on departure was because of the presence of </p><p>UNMOVIC inspectors in the country: "they (the GOI) didn\'t </p><p>want a controversy now, so they let us go.  If the inspectors </p><p>weren\'t there, I think it would have been different."  After </p><p>finishing border formalities on the Iraqi side, the convoy </p><p>crossed over to Jordan about 1730, just as the sun was going </p><p>down over the Iraqi desert.  After a short rest they </p><p>continued on for the final 3 1/2 hour drive to Amman. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>In Baghdad, Iraqis Wait for the Inevitable </p><p>and Hunger for Information </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Regarding final impressions, Bernacki said that the </p><p>mood in Baghdad now is "very, very heavy.  People are tired </p><p>and are waiting for a war that they believe is inevitable and </p><p>unavoidable.  They feel that if its going to happen, let it </p><p>happen."  He noted that "everything seems to be in suspended </p><p>animation . . . even the smuggling.  Businesspeople -- </p><p>legitimate or otherwise -- are worried about importing goods </p><p>that might get destroyed or looted" should military action </p><p>begin. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In this environment, Bernacki offered that the U.S. </p><p>should step up its propaganda efforts with the Iraqi public </p><p>now, before any military action commences: "Make it clear </p><p>that they are not the target and that their future will be </p><p>better than what they\'ve lived under.  Do it by radio.  It\'s </p><p>the most efficient and best way to reach all Iraqis and they </p><p>are hungry for independent information." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Future Plans: A Hope To Return </p><p>One More Time And Turn Over the Keys </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Bernacki is in the process of turning over all four </p><p>USINT Baghdad vehicles to Embassy Amman, along with the keys </p><p>to the Baghdad facilities and other USG equipment.  After he </p><p>arrives in Poland, he intends to take a few days of leave and </p><p>will then debrief the Polish MFA and call on Embassy Warsaw </p><p>to discuss next steps.  As our discussion concluded, Bernacki </p><p>stressed -- as he has in every meeting with us since he took </p><p>on the responsibilities of USINT Chief in January 2001 -- </p><p>that he would like nothing more than the honor of handing </p><p>over the keys to the Interest Section to a U.S. diplomat when </p><p>it becomes -- once again -- the U.S. Embassy to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
