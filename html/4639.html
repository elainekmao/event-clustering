<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 007130 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR MILLS/PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, EPET, ETTC, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S ENERGY MINISTER ON TANKERS AND PIPELINES </p><p>AND PRICE HIKES (OH MY!) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge D\'Affaires Gregory Berry, reasons 1.5 (b.d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p>1.  (s)  Energy Minister Mohammed Bataineh updated DCM </p><p>December 4 on a number of developments in Jordan\'s energy </p><p>sector.  The Minister commented on challenges facing the GOJ </p><p>in maintaining a floating oil reserve in a tanker in Aqaba, </p><p>discussed latest developments on the al-Arish-Aqaba gas </p><p>pipeline, and reviewed the kingdom\'s ongoing efforts to </p><p>privatize the energy sector and to marketize prices for </p><p>petroleum products.  The updates portray a ministry that is </p><p>committed to diversifying and marketizing.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Tanker Update </p><p> </p><p>2.  (s)  Following discussions of Jordan\'s negotiations with </p><p>Iraq on the annual trade and oil protocol (septel), Energy </p><p>Minister Mohammed Bataineh briefed the DCM on developments in </p><p>a range of activities under the ministry\'s supervision. </p><p>Bataineh said the oil tanker Jordan has purchased as a </p><p>floating oil storage facility is roughly one-third filled </p><p>(80,000 tons out of a capacity of 260,000 tons).  This </p><p>initial inflow had been accomplished by emptying the existing </p><p>storage tanks in Aqaba into the ship.  Additional filling of </p><p>the ship, he said, would be much slower, owing to logistical </p><p>constraints -- the rate at which tanker trucks could off-load </p><p>into either the Aqaba storage tanks or the ship itself, plus </p><p>a recent problem removing 50,000 tons of ballast water from </p><p>some of the tanker\'s receptacles (in an environmentally </p><p>friendly way) to make room for additional oil.  Bataineh said </p><p>oil for the ship is being received from Iraq at the rate of </p><p>about 3,800 tons per day, meaning it will take at least </p><p>another 48 days before the tanker is fully loaded. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (s)  Complicating this calculation, said Bataineh, is the </p><p>fact that Jordan has only one oil jetty that also functions </p><p>as the sole jetty for vegetable oil, Liquid Propane Gas (LPG) </p><p>and sulpho-chemicals.  Every time another ship needs to use </p><p>the jetty, the tanker must be moved at a cost of $50,000 in </p><p>fuel oil and gasoil (used to fire the inefficient steam </p><p>engines of the tanker).  Bataineh said the GOJ had considered </p><p>"banking" the ships, i.e., holding multiple ships in parallel </p><p>at the jetty and running hoses across the decks of the </p><p>close-to ships out to the outlying ships.  However, while </p><p>this proved a workable solution for vegetable oil, safety </p><p>concerns precluded using this method to load/offload LPG or </p><p>sulpho-chemicals.  Bataineh said the GOJ is now looking into </p><p>transforming an existing jetty currently used for offloading </p><p>timber (south of the main port) into a second oil jetty.  The </p><p>main problem so far, he said, was that the draft at the </p><p>timber jetty was only 6.5 meters, compared to the 12 meters </p><p>needed to house oil tankers.  Bataineh said the GOJ would be </p><p>interested in examining the potential for dredging the timber </p><p>jetty, but did not have the expertise or equipment to do so. </p><p> </p><p>Al Arish Proceeding Apace </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Bataineh said the gas pipeline project between al </p><p>Arish gas field in Egypt and Aqaba was on schedule, with gas </p><p>delivery to the Aqaba power plant planned to begin in June </p><p>2003.  The Aqaba plant generates 40% of Jordan\'s power needs, </p><p>and currently accounts for 14% of Jordan\'s oil consumption. </p><p>The next step, said Bataineh, is to negotiate the terms for </p><p>extending the pipeline from Aqaba to northern Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>Price Hikes In The Offing </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Bataineh confirmed that the GOJ is looking ahead to </p><p>raising prices for certain petroleum products in the coming </p><p>months.  Gasoline prices, according to Bataineh, are roughly </p><p>at world market levels (note: $1.45/gallon for leaded regular </p><p>at the pump.  End note.).  Thus the GOJ is focusing on </p><p>heavily-subsidized products, including LPG, gasoil and </p><p>kerosene.  Bataineh said a plan is in the works to phase out </p><p>subsidies for LPG over two years.  Currently, consumers pay </p><p>approximately $3.52 for a bottle of LPG that costs the GOJ </p><p>$4.93 to produce.  The government\'s aim is to eliminate that </p><p>cost to the government by slowly rationalizing prices. </p><p>However, Bataineh stressed, the GOJ was loathe to undertake </p><p>price hikes immediately in advance of elections (currently </p><p>scheduled for spring 2003). </p><p> </p><p>Privatizations: Rolling, Rocky </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Bataineh said privatization plans for Jordan\'s </p><p>electrical power generation and distribution operations are </p><p>proceeding as planned.  He expected the GOJ to be ready to </p><p>issue RFP\'s for the two operations by the end of January </p><p>2003, and noted several multinationals had expressed interest </p><p>(though he did not name them).  At the same time, plans long </p><p>underway to build the al-Samra independent power project </p><p>(IPP) in northern Jordan have fallen into disarray after </p><p>Belgian energy giant Tractebel pulled out of its pledge to </p><p>take on the project at the eleventh hour.  Bataineh said </p><p>Tractebel blamed a 44% decline in its share prices for its </p><p>decision to pull out of the IPP as well as a $2 billion </p><p>refinery project in Abu Dhabi.  The GOJ\'s back-up plan, he </p><p>said, was to task CEGCO, the government-owned generation </p><p>company, to build the plant.  It was unclear what impact on </p><p>CEGCO\'s own privatization such a new project might have. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7.  (s)  Jordan continues to move forward on a number of </p><p>fronts both to diversify its sources of energy and to get the </p><p>government out of the energy subsidy business, which is in </p><p>all cases a loss-making operation.  Bataineh said the GOJ </p><p>would welcome any offered assistance on plans to study </p><p>dredging the timber jetty. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  He also said the GOJ would welcome TDA or other </p><p>USG assistance to study Jordan\'s future energy infrastructure </p><p>- what its capacity would be, how to organize the various </p><p>power generation facilities (oil, gas, wind, solar), and what </p><p>likely national and regional demand is likely to be.  In this </p><p>regard, he praised TDA assistance earlier this year on </p><p>Jordan\'s wind farms. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
