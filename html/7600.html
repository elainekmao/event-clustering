(Refer to Septel.) </p><p>The trip focused on health, development and cultural issues </p><p>in the region and provided the opportunity for Post to </p><p>emphasize work being funded by the U.S. Government in Marib. </p><p>In order to highlight project funding in the area, three </p><p>journalists and one photographer accompanied the Ambassador </p><p>on the trip.  The journalists attended all events on both </p><p>days of the trip and have since positively reported on Post\'s </p><p>development projects in Marib.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Journalists </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. Journalists accompanying Ambassador were Mohammed bin </p><p>Sallam from the Yemen Times (Yemen\'s principle English </p><p>language, quasi-independent weekly), Mohammed Fare </p><p>Al-Shaibani from Al-Ayyam (Aden-based independent), and </p><p>Abdullah Hizam, editor, and Abdul Aziz Omer Abdul Aziz, </p><p>photographer, from Saba News Agency (Yemen\'s main source of </p><p>official news information). </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Site Visits </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. During the trip, the Ambassador signed an agricultural </p><p>agreement with the Governor of Marib, Abdulla Ali Al-Nassi, </p><p>and visited future agricultural/farm development sites. </p><p>Ambassador also visited a school with new desks funded by the </p><p>U.S. Government, discussed a future museum in Marib to </p><p>protect ancient artifacts found in the region and visited the </p><p>President\'s Hospital where he spoke with students who are </p><p>receiving scholarships from the U.S. Government to study </p><p>various medical fields.  Upon completion of their studies, </p><p>the students will return to Marib to work at the President\'s </p><p>Hospital. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Reporting </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>4. Reporting to date has been immensely positive and has </p><p>covered most of the development sites visited during the trip. </p><p> </p><p>5. On April 20, Yemen TV reported on the visit of the U.S. </p><p>Ambassador and stated that the focus of the trip was on </p><p>development and cultural issues in the area.  The news </p><p>broadcast specifically mentioned the signing of an </p><p>agricultural agreement and the future building of a museum in </p><p>Marib. </p><p> </p><p>6. Also on April 20, Al-Thawra (privately owned independent) </p><p>reported two stories regarding the signing of the </p><p>agricultural agreement and U.S. development aid to Yemen. </p><p>Al-Ayyam carried a front page story that covered the signing </p><p>of the agricultural agreement with the Governor of Marib and </p><p>a press conference held by Ambassador on the afternoon of the </p><p>trip.  In the interview, one of the reporters asked, "Why </p><p>Marib?" as a place for U.S. funding.  The Ambassador\'s </p><p>response of the importance of their being "no development </p><p>without security and no security without development" was </p><p>quoted in the paper. </p><p> </p><p>7. On April 21, both Al-Thawra and Al-Ayyam reported </p><p>additional details of the Ambassador\'s visit.  Al-Ayyam </p><p>carried a story on the front page with two photos of the </p><p>Ambassador and information regarding the U.S.-funded projects </p><p>in Marib. </p><p> </p><p>8. Post expects additional coverage will be forthcoming once </p><p>the reporters who accompanied the Ambassador on the trip have </p><p>had time to process photographs and write additional story </p><p>lines.  The Yemen Times is published only once per week and </p><p>the Yemen Times reporter indicated that the newspaper will be </p><p>reporting on the trip the following Sunday. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Post PD Follow-Up to the Visit </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. Post will be issuing additional press releases in the </p><p>up-coming week on each of the four funding initiatives </p><p>covered on the recent trip.  The press releases will focus </p><p>mainly on the problem, how Yemenis are being incorporated </p><p>into the development projects addressing these issues and </p><p>what the U.S. Government is doing to provide development </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
