<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0082 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MARCH 19, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1. This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for March 19, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Milliyet/Turkiye/Tercuman/Dunya/Hurriyet: </p><p>Kurds in northern Iraq who are afraid that Saddam </p><p>may launch a chemical attack started fleeing </p><p>toward the Turkish and Iranian borders. The </p><p>number who have left their houses has reached </p><p>20,000 people. Thousands of people leaving </p><p>Kirkuk, Mosul, Dohuk and its townships moved </p><p>toward locations close to the Turkish border, </p><p>such as Selidiza, Sersing, Batufa, Begopva, and </p><p>Bamerni. While some of the Kurds stay with their </p><p>relatives in those places, the others set up </p><p>tents. In the meantime, Kurdish holders of </p><p>passports with dual citizenship entered Turkey </p><p>from Habur border gate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet: Turkey is considering setting up </p><p>camps in northern Iraq to help thousands of </p><p>refugees in the war. Turkey is not planning to </p><p>seal its borders but will allow "controlled </p><p>passes" into Turkey. Iran announced that it would </p><p>not except refugees into the country but would </p><p>help them on the Iraqi side of the border. While </p><p>civilians in Kirkuk try to go to safer </p><p>mountainous Kurdish region in the North, it is </p><p>reported that the Iraqi soldiers in Kirkuk are </p><p>demoralized and ready to surrender.  It has been </p><p>announced from that municipality\'s loudspeakers </p><p>that anyone who went out of their houses would be </p><p>shot during the war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Tercuman: The Red Cross and Red Crescent </p><p>Federation announced that it has prepared the </p><p>largest emergency relief operation in its </p><p>history. The Federation has units poised in Iraq </p><p>and neighboring countries to supply refugees\' </p><p>needs, including field hospitals, potable water, </p><p>toilet facilities, and other urgent necessities. </p><p>The Federation expects to give services to at </p><p>least one million people a month in those units. </p><p>The Federation has prepared sheltering facilities </p><p>for up to 250,000 refugees who might flee from </p><p>Iraq to Iran, Jordan, Syria, and Turkey. The </p><p>camps on the Turkish side have been rechecked and </p><p>any shortcomings have been rectified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Milliyet/Radikal/Sabah/Tercuman: In a joint </p><p>meeting of representatives from the US, Turkey, </p><p>and Iraqi Kurds and Turkmens in Ankara, it was </p><p>agreed that the Kurds will not enter Mosul and </p><p>Kirkuk.  The US will administer the region. </p><p>Turkmens will be included in Iraq\'s new </p><p>administration.  An independent Kurdish will not </p><p>be founded.  The US envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, </p><p>warned the Kurds against rioting. Turkey said it </p><p>could unilaterally enter northern Iraq to stop </p><p>refugee flows; the Kurds rejected Turkey\'s </p><p>possible unilateral incursion. Khalilzad </p><p>announced Turkey should act in harmony with the </p><p>coalition forces, and urged a "commission of five </p><p>parties" under US leadership - and including </p><p>Turkey, IKDP, PUK, and Turkmens -- to be </p><p>established to deal with migration, combating </p><p>terrorism, and other issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Cumhuriyet/Radikal: It is reported that the </p><p>"Repubblica Drima" Italian-flag vessel was not </p><p>allowed to offload six of its containers, </p><p>including ammunitions for Stinger missiles and </p><p>tanks. Stingers had been offloaded some time ago </p><p>from a different freighter for the protection of </p><p>US bases in Turkey. Based on instructions by the </p><p>Turkish General Staff, the lids of the freighter </p><p>were kept locked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Cumhuriyet/Radikal/Evrensel: Based on </p><p>increased tension and security concerns the </p><p>Department of State announced a public warning </p><p>that US citizens in 23 provinces in Southeast </p><p>Turkey should leave the region and postpone any </p><p>nonessential travel there. While the Department </p><p>of State initiated authorized departure from the </p><p>Consulate in Adana, the Pentagon authorized </p><p>voluntary departure of dependents of military </p><p>personnel at Incirlik AB. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Cumhuriyet/Radikal/Sabah/Tercuman/Dunya/Hurri yet: </p><p>As tension has mounted prior the war, Incirlik AB </p><p>was put on alert status "Charlie", the status </p><p>before the war.  The announcement of the next </p><p>level, "Delta", will mean war has started. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Evrensel: "Regional Crisis Management </p><p>Centers" have been established in the provinces </p><p>in the region.  The purpose of these centers is </p><p>coordinate relief operations together with </p><p>international relief organizations.  In addition, </p><p>it has been announced that press members without </p><p>credentials are prohibited from working in </p><p>Diyarbakir, Mardin, Batman, Sirnak, Hakkari and </p><p>Van provinces.  The credentials cards issued by </p><p>the Diyarbakir Press Center will be valid for a </p><p>period of two months and should be carried with a </p><p>valid ID card or passport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Evrensel: It has been announced by Adana\'s </p><p>Labor, Peace and Democracy Block, made up of </p><p>DEHAP, EMEP, labor unions, and NGOs, that Newroz </p><p>festivities will be held at the Yuregir </p><p>Secondhand Auto Market Lot in Adana at 10:00 a.m. </p><p>on March 21. Various concerts will play Turkish, </p><p>Kurdish, and Arabic tunes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Evrensel: On the grounds of being </p><p>unproductive, the Vocational School of </p><p>Agriculture along the Van-Ercis highway is being </p><p>turned into F-type prison. No new students have </p><p>been enrolled for the past two years, and the </p><p>school currently has only 16 students. Of the </p><p>school\'s 12,700 acres, only 750 acres will be </p><p>left to the school while the remainder will be </p><p>turned over to the Justice Ministry for prison. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Turkiye: Based on a tip, jandarma arrested </p><p>nine persons in Sati village of Diyarbakir. While </p><p>searching the car of one of the detainees, </p><p>jandarma found 300 grams of heroin in secret </p><p>compartments of the vehicle. In Malatya, the </p><p>police seized 4 kilograms of heroin in a house. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
