<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002836 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State for ECA/A/E/USS Taylor; AF/PD Skop; </p><p>IIP/G/AF Danz; Info AF/W </p><p>Lagos for PAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, SCUL, OEXC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: Annual American Studies Conference </p><p>in Nigeria Focuses on Religion in American </p><p>Society. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref: A) State 104708 B) Abuja 171 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: Highlighting "Religion in the </p><p>US," American Studies specialists discussed </p><p>religion and American society at the recent </p><p>8th Annual Conference of the American </p><p>Studies Association of Nigeria (ASAN) held </p><p>in Jos.  Unlike previous seminars, this </p><p>year\'s gathering was more effective because </p><p>fewer papers were presented which allowed </p><p>for in-depth discussions and exchange of </p><p>ideas.  The participation of Professor David </p><p>Harrell, who teaches the history American </p><p>religion at Auburn University, kept the </p><p>deliberations on the theme of the conference </p><p>on track.  Professor Harrell\'s in-depth </p><p>analysis of the dynamics of American </p><p>religious life won the respect of both </p><p>Christian and Muslim intellectuals who </p><p>attended the conference.  Harrell\'s </p><p>presentation, "Awash in a Sea of Faith," </p><p>provided a strong base for a stimulating </p><p>discussion throughout the three-day seminar. </p><p>This is a GPRA report.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Description of Activity: A three-day </p><p>conference of the American Studies </p><p>Association of Nigeria (ASAN).  The theme </p><p>for the seminar was "Religion in the United </p><p>States."  Professor David Harrell, who </p><p>teaches American religious history, served </p><p>as the lead speaker during the conference. </p><p>He was joined by other Nigerian American </p><p>Studies specialists and commentators who </p><p>delivered papers on various aspects of </p><p>religion in the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Dates: August 13 - 15, FY 2001, 4th Qtr </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Justification/Objective: Since it was </p><p>founded about 10 years ago, the American </p><p>Studies Association of Nigeria (ASAN) has </p><p>continued to demonstrate a genuine interest </p><p>in promoting American Studies program in </p><p>Nigerian universities. By focusing on </p><p>religion in the US during this year\'s </p><p>conference, ASAN wanted to stimulate a </p><p>healthy and vibrant discussion with </p><p>academics, religious intellectuals, </p><p>influential politicians and journalists on </p><p>an important issue that is worthy of study </p><p>in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  MPP Umbrella Themes/Audience Reached: </p><p>NI-PD-07 (Strengthening Institutions that </p><p>Bear on the Understanding of the US).  Over </p><p>100 participants, representing the various </p><p>ASAN chapters from 22 federal, state and </p><p>private universities attended the seminar. </p><p>Also in attendance were representatives of </p><p>Christian and Muslim groups, journalists and </p><p>students.  The Deputy Governor of Plateau </p><p>State and several high-level members of his </p><p>cabinet attended the opening ceremony. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Result/Impact: Excellent.  The </p><p>association\'s decision to address religion </p><p>in the United States at the conference was </p><p>good.  For the first time in recent years, </p><p>Nigerian intellectuals were able to reflect </p><p>on religious tolerance in the Nigerian </p><p>context in an environment devoid of any </p><p>religious zeal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Non-USG Funding: N/A. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Quality of US Support: Excellent.  Post </p><p>thanks ECA/A/E/USS for funding Professor </p><p>David Harrell to attend the conference and </p><p>for providing ASAN with a grant to host the </p><p>program.  The ASAN executive committee </p><p>members and most participants pointed out </p><p>that the participation of an American expert </p><p>on religion was a good idea and contributed </p><p>greatly in the success of the conference. </p><p>Harrell\'s comments, especially his assertion </p><p>that religion was hale and hearty in </p><p>America, asopposed to its declining </p><p>condition in Europe where government had </p><p>sheltered it, were well received and </p><p>generated lively debates at the conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Comment: The quality of discussion at </p><p>the conference was excellent.  Most of the </p><p>papers presented were of high academic and </p><p>professional standards.  Given the diverse </p><p>representation of scholars throughout </p><p>Nigerian universities at the seminar, it is </p><p>now clear that American Studies has not only </p><p>become relevant but acceptable among faculty </p><p>members and students in this important </p><p>African country.  The next seminar will take </p><p>place in the Eastern City of Calabar in </p><p>August 2002.  Post again would like to </p><p>solicit the support of ECA/A/E/USS in </p><p>advance in funding the project and in </p><p>recruiting a US keynote speaker to </p><p>participate in the conference. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
