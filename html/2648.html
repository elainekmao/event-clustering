HUSSEIN </p><p>AIDID IS THE HEAD OF THE SOMALI RECONCILIATION AND </p><p>RESTORATION COUNCIL (SRRC) FACTION BUT HAS NO REAL CLAIM TO </p><p>BEING PRESIDENT OF SOMALIA.  EXPRESSING EXTREME DISTRUST OF </p><p>ITALIAN AND EUROPEAN INTENTIONS, MS. AIDID SOUGHT A "NEW </p><p>PARTNERSHIP" BETWEEN SOMALIA AND THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MFA, MS. AIDID HAS A NUMBER OF BEEFS AGAINST </p><p>THE GOI, PRINCIPALLY THAT SHE IS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE SOMALI </p><p>EMBASSY AND ITS BANK ACCOUNT.  SHE MADE A NUMBER OF SERIOUS </p><p>AND INCREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE GOI, INCLUDING THAT </p><p>THE GOI HAD STOLEN SOMALI GOVERNMENT PROPERTY, PERMITTED ARMS </p><p>TO BE SMUGGLED INTO SOMALIA, AND SENT ASSASSINS TO KILL HER </p><p>BROTHER.

(C) MS. AIDID IS THE DAUGHTER OF ASSASSINATED WARLORD </p><p>GENERAL AIDID AND SISTER OF "SOMALI PRESIDENT" HUSSEIN </p><p>MOHAMED AIDID.  ACCORDING TO MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR EAST </p><p>AFRICAN AFFAIRS PAOLA IMPERIALE, HUSSEIN AIDID REPRESENTS </p><p>HIMSELF INSIDE SOMALIA AS THE HEAD OF THE ETHIOPIAN-ALLIED </p><p>SRRC, NOT CHIEF OF STATE.  HIS ONLY CLAIM TO BEING </p><p>"PRESIDENT" IS PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>PALACE.  IMPERIALE DISMISSED HIM AS NOT EVEN A PARTICULARLY </p><p>INFLUENTIAL WARLORD.  STILL MORE ODDLY, HUSSEIN HAD RECENTLY </p><p>BYPASSED HIS SISTER AND CANNATA TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE GOI </p><p>VIA ANOTHER ITALIAN.  (THE MESSAGE STATED THAT HE WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO CONSULT WITH THE GOI REGARDING THE UPCOMING NAIROBI PEACE </p><p>CONFERENCE, IN WHICH THE SRRC HAS AGREED TO PARTICIPATE. </p><p>IMPERIALE NOTED THAT THE GOI HAD SENT TWO MESSAGES TO </p><p>ETHIOPIA, THE FIRST ENCOURAGING ETHIOPIA TO PARTICIPATE AND </p><p>THE SECOND RECOGNIZING ITS INFLUENCE OVER CERTAIN </p><p>PARTIES--READ SRRC--AND ASKING IT TO CONVINCE THEM TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) ACCORDING TO BACKGROUND INFORMATION FROM IMPERIALE, </p><p>MS. AIDID AND CANNATA--WHO IS EITHER HER HUSBAND OR LIVE-IN </p><p>PARTNER--WENT TO THE MFA PROTOCOL OFFICE LATE LAST YEAR TO </p><p>REQUEST THAT A POLICE ESCORT BE PROVIDED SO THAT SHE COULD </p><p>OCCUPY THE SOMALI EMBASSY.  THE FORMER CONSUL GENERAL (A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LATE AIDID SR.\'S GOVERNMENT) LIVES IN </p><p>THE EMBASSY AS A CARETAKER AND GUARDIAN OF ITS SECRET FILES. </p><p>PROTOCOL INFORMED MS. AIDID THAT IT WOULD BE UNABLE TO HELP </p><p>HER ACCESS THE EMBASSY, SINCE SHE WAS NO LONGER AN ACCREDITED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01402  01 OF 03  191616Z </p><p>DIPLOMAT IN ITALY AND THE GOI DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN SOMALIA.  IN EARLY DECEMBER, JUST BEFORE </p><p>SENDING HER MEETING REQUEST TO US, AIDID ASKED THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE TO PROVIDE HER ACCESS TO THE SOMALI </p><p>EMBASSY\'S BANK ACCOUNT.  AIDID WAS INFORMED THAT THE MINISTRY </p><p>DID NOT KNOW IF OR WHERE THE EMBASSY STILL HAD FUNDS IN </p><p>ITALY.  IN ANY CASE, IT WOULD BE UNABLE TO OBLIGE A BANK TO </p><p>PROVIDE ACCESS TO HER WITHOUT EITHER WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM </p><p>THE ACCOUNT SIGNATORIES OR INSTRUCTIONS FROM A RECOGNIZED </p><p>SOMALI GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.

AIDID PROVIDED POST WITH A DOCUMENT THAT </p><p>INDICATES THAT SHE CAME TO ITALY IN 1986 AS AN ACCREDITED </p><p>THIRD SECRETARY AT THE EMBASSY; SHE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONTINUALLY RESIDENT HERE SINCE.  MS. AIDID ALSO PRESENTED A </p><p>COURT DECISION STATING THAT IN JUNE 2000, THE PREFECT OF </p><p>VITERBO ORDERED HER DEPORTED FOR REMAINING WITHOUT APPLYING </p><p>FOR RESIDENCY.  HE APPARENTLY BELIEVED THAT HER DIPLOMATIC </p><p>VISA WAS NO LONGER VALID, SINCE SHE DID NOT REPRESENT A </p><p>RECOGNIZED GOVERNMENT.
