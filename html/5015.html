<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000057 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ETRD, MOPS, SNAR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERGER SUPPORTS CAFTA AND A </p><p>REDUCTION OF THE MILITARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  In a tour d\'horizon with the Ambassador on </p><p>January 7, PAN Presidential candidate Oscar Berger said that </p><p>the PAN believes it will win the 2003 national elections, and </p><p>that their priorities as a government would be completing </p><p>negotiation of a free trade agreement with us, "rightsizing" </p><p>the military and implementing the 1996 Peace Accords (without </p><p>calling it that).  The Ambassador told Berger that addressing </p><p>Guatemala\'s growing problem of violent common crime and the </p><p>influence of the criminal mafias would be critical for the </p><p>success of the next government, whoever is elected.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador and A/DCM had breakfast with </p><p>center-right Partido Accion Nacional (PAN) presidential </p><p>candidate Oscar Berger, and his campaign manager Eduardo </p><p>Gonzalez on January 7.  Most polls show Berger significantly </p><p>ahead of all other potential candidates in public preference; </p><p>Guatemalan polls are notoriously inaccurate, however, and the </p><p>elections remain almost ten months away.  Gonzalez noted, in </p><p>that connection, that current polling is like asking a person </p><p>who isn\'t hungry what he wants for dinner, implying that the </p><p>PAN realizes current numbers are soft.  Berger enjoys </p><p>considerable financial support from the private sector and </p><p>growing popular support from those opposed to the ruling </p><p>Frente Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG). </p><p> </p><p>THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>3. (C)  Berger expressed confidence that the PAN will win the </p><p>2003 national elections, noting that the polls show him </p><p>considerably ahead of other potential contenders.  He </p><p>believes FRG Secretary General and former strongman Efrain </p><p>Rios Montt will not be a candidate, choosing instead to </p><p>protect his legal immunity by running again for Congress </p><p>where he is certain to win a seat.  Berger and Gonzalez both </p><p>expressed concern that the ruling FRG would use government </p><p>resources to leverage public support in the elections, and </p><p>argued that OAS election observation needs to begin long </p><p>before election day (Note: we understand the local OAS office </p><p>is already in talks with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal on </p><p>the possibility of an early OAS observation role in the </p><p>elections. end note).  Berger believes the FRG will try to </p><p>use financial payments to the former civil patrol members </p><p>(ex-PACs) to buy their votes, and will manipulate the ongoing </p><p>census to increase the FRG\'s representation in the </p><p>legislature. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s question regarding </p><p>public divisions in the PAN, Berger remarked that he had </p><p>decided, against the advise of some of this collaborators, to </p><p>make concessions to party Secretary General Leonel Lopez in </p><p>order to heal the wounds still dividing the party from the </p><p>recent primary election.  He implied that he is prepared to </p><p>offer Lopez much of the patronage he sought.  It was apparent </p><p>from Gonzalez\'s reaction to this statement that the decision </p><p>to make concessions to Lopez continues to divide Berger\'s </p><p>team.  Berger also commented that he is meeting with small </p><p>political parties from the full range of the political </p><p>spectrum seeking to build a broad base of support.  He noted </p><p>that he has already had positive responses from emerging </p><p>political leaders Otto Perez Molina and Jorge Briz. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Berger believes that his election would ensure that </p><p>all the countries of Central America have forward-looking </p><p>pragmatic leaders, commenting that, following the elections </p><p>of Maduro and Bolanos, the Portillo administration is last of </p><p>a breed of populist authoritarians that used to rule the </p><p>isthmus. </p><p> </p><p>CAFTA </p><p>----- </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador told Berger that we believe a free </p><p>trade agreement between Central America and the United States </p><p>will revolutionize the countries of the isthmus, and will </p><p>offer unprecedented opportunities for economic growth and </p><p>poverty reduction.  Berger agreed, and said his presidency </p><p>would fully support expedited negotiation of CAFTA, and </p><p>expressed regret that the Portillo government has not </p><p>invested more effort in the regional negotiation.  Berger, </p><p>who travels frequently to El Salvador and maintains a strong </p><p>relationship with President Flores, opined that El Salvador </p><p>is significantly ahead of Guatemala in preparations for </p><p>CAFTA, and argued that Guatemala had suffered from "a poor </p><p>negotiating team" and lack of interest on the part of </p><p>Portillo.  He promised that a PAN government would make CAFTA </p><p>one of its highest priorities. </p><p> </p><p>THE FUTURE OF THE ARMED FORCES AND FIGHTING CRIME </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>7. (C) Prompted by the Ambassador, Berger mused about the </p><p>future of the military in Guatemala, arguing that they </p><p>currently have no role which justified their consumption of </p><p>such a considerable part of the government\'s budget.  He said </p><p>his own inclination is to eliminate the military altogether </p><p>or turn it into a national guard "like in Costa Rica," but </p><p>his advisors disagree with him.  He said that if the military </p><p>can not be abolished, it should be given a crime fighting </p><p>role "as in Honduras."  He said Portillo has come up with a </p><p>plan to put 15,000 soldiers in a modified uniform on the </p><p>streets to control crime, and Berger thinks that is a good </p><p>idea.  The Ambassador noted that using the military in a </p><p>police support role would violate the Peace Accords, and </p><p>asked if that job could not better be done by the police. </p><p>Berger took the point, but said that he believed military </p><p>discipline was necessary to confront the overwhelming problem </p><p>of violent crime. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Ambassador asked Berger how he envisioned </p><p>combating the organized crime mafias which currently have so </p><p>much influence with the government, noting that the success </p><p>of the next government will depend to a large extent on </p><p>bringing violent crime and organized crime under control. </p><p>Berger acknowledged that controlling the influence of </p><p>organized crime is not going to be easy.  He said that when </p><p>he travels for campaign rallies to Peten, Izabal and Zacapa </p><p>(the heartland of narcotrafficking) he has to be very careful </p><p>about who offers him security and who wants to be </p><p>photographed with him, as he does not know to distinguish </p><p>between local supporters and local druglords.  He said his </p><p>own local campaign organizers are totally intimidated by the </p><p>criminal mafias and often are scared to shield him from them </p><p>when they want to participate in his rallies.  Berger said </p><p>that his campaign would set up an intelligence section which </p><p>would vet all names for public positions, so that his </p><p>government would not come to power with debts or promises to </p><p>give jobs to narco-traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE PEACE ACCORDS (BY ANOTHER NAME) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>9. (C) Berger said that the party is working diligently on </p><p>drawing up a plan of government, and that the basis for the </p><p>PAN campaign platform would be the "essence" of the 1996 </p><p>Peace Accords.  Berger commented that there was no national </p><p>consensus to back the accords, generating resistance to plans </p><p>which bear the "Peace Accord" label.  He said that the PAN </p><p>platform would parallel the Peace Accords closely, but that </p><p>it would not make explicit reference to the Accords. </p><p> </p><p>REGIONAL INTEGRATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>10. (C) Berger disparaged the Central American Parliament </p><p>(PARLACEN) for not being anything more than a hide out for </p><p>third rate politicians and crooks.  He said that it was the </p><p>most worthless of the more than 60 Central American </p><p>integration organizations, and it absorbed more money than </p><p>all the other institutions put together.  He said that </p><p>governments found it to be a convenient way of providing </p><p>patronage, however, and he does not see any initiative to </p><p>abolish it. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>11. (C) Berger was very much at ease, and discussed his goals </p><p>for addressing national issues with greater depth and </p><p>self-confidence than in the earlier stages of his campaign. </p><p>He wanted to project himself as someone who shares many of </p><p>our same values, and someone we could work with to transform </p><p>Guatemala through free trade and greater cooperation against </p><p>transnational crime.  Despite early poll results favorable to </p><p>Berger, the outcome of the election is far from predictable. </p><p>That said, disaffection with the current FRG government has </p><p>led many, at this early stage of the campaign, to see Berger </p><p>as the most viable alternative. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
