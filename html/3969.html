<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002837 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.: DECL: 10/11/12 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: ABACHA FAMILY\'S TIGHT GRIP ON LOOT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) ABUJA 01028 B) ABUJA 02276 (C) ABUJA 02767 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMB. HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASON 1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Chances are fleeting that President </p><p>Obasanjo will see USD 1.2 billion in stolen Abacha </p><p>loot.  Under pressure from Northern political leaders, </p><p>Obasanjo released late military leader Sani Abacha\'s </p><p>son Mohammed from prison September 24. With Mohammed\'s </p><p>release, Obasanjo surrendered his best leverage over </p><p>the Abacha family.  Obasanjo, who hoped for both </p><p>political and federal budgetary benefits from the </p><p>purported "Mohammed\'s release for USD 1.2 billion" </p><p>exchange, may now end up empty-handed. With Mohammed\'s </p><p>release, the Abachas will likely use some of the </p><p>purloined funds to finance Obasanjo\'s political </p><p>enemies.  This would be akin to an insurance policy </p><p>against Obasanjo\'s recouping the entire USD 1.2 </p><p>billion. If Obasanjo is defeated in his reelection </p><p>bid, the Abachas can be fairly certain that the </p><p>election victors will not pursue them, and definitely </p><p>not with the alacrity of Obasanjo.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Obasanjo\'s Gamble </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) After almost three years of incarceration, Sani </p><p>Abacha\'s eldest son Mohammed was released to a hero\'s </p><p>welcome (by almost exclusively Northern well-wishers) </p><p>on September 24.  His release resulted from the public </p><p>agitation of many of Obasanjo\'s Northern political </p><p>foes, led by House Speaker Ghali Na\'Abba. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The private intervention of other Northern </p><p>leaders such as Emir Bayero of Kano and the Kano State </p><p>Governor Kwankwaso, an Obasanjo ally, were also </p><p>crucial.  In effect, Obasanjo\'s political foes had </p><p>successfully turned Mohammed\'s detention into a </p><p>political rallying point in the North.  Mohammed </p><p>symbolized Obasanjo\'s and the South\'s attempted </p><p>"subjugation" of the North.  With Mohammed turning </p><p>into a martyr in the North, Obasanjo\'s few allies in </p><p>the region came under heat to pressure the President </p><p>to give Mohammed his freedom. (Comment: That the </p><p>agitation for Mohammed\'s release came now was not </p><p>coincidental.  Believing Obasanjo was on the ropes </p><p>because of the impeachment attempt, his foes did not </p><p>want him to score a political or budgetary benefit by </p><p>getting his hands on the Abacha trove. Adding insult </p><p>to Obasanjo\'s injury, The Abachas apparently are </p><p>pursuing a lawsuit to thwart Obasanjo\'s attempt to </p><p>freeze their foreign bank accounts. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) (Note: As part of an earlier deal to release </p><p>Mohammed, the Abacha family agreed to return USD 1.2 </p><p>billion taken during Sani\'Abacha\'s regime.  The GON </p><p>also agreed to dismiss the murder charges against </p><p>Mohammed for the assassination of Kudirat Abiola. </p><p>When the murder charges were dismissed, the GON kept </p><p>Mohammed in detention because the family did not hand </p><p>over the USD 1.2 billion. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Since Mohammed\'s release, the Abacha mansion in </p><p>Kano has received an endless stream of visitors.  Most </p><p>have been politicians seeking publicity and many no </p><p>doubt rushed there hoping to get their eager fingers </p><p>on some Abacha loot. Some have even urged Mohammed to </p><p>run for office.  While Mohammed probably will demur, </p><p>the family will likely channel money to one of the </p><p>anti-Obasanjo parties. In that former head of state </p><p>Babangida supports the UNPP and NDP, chances are the </p><p>Abachas will direct their support to the ANPP, and </p><p>they may end up supporting its most salient candidate, </p><p>former military ruler Mohammadu Buhari, another </p><p>popular figure in Kano.  However, House Speaker Ghali </p><p>Na\'Abba has his eyes on the presidency and his remote </p><p>dark horse chance in the PDP can be boosted by an </p><p>injection of funds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Comment: Abachas Play for Time </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) It looks like Obasanjo has been finessed by the </p><p>Abacha family and their allies.  Due to pressure from </p><p>Northern politicians, Obasanjo released Mohammed, </p><p>giving up the only real leverage he had to get the </p><p>funds. In exchange, the Abacha clan gave him promises </p><p>of questionable legal enforceability.  Additionally, </p><p>it would be politically awkward for Obasanjo to </p><p>publicly acknowledge that all he had in hand was an </p><p>agreement but no money. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) From the Abacha perspective, there is no </p><p>incentive to hand Obasanjo USD 1.2 billion. Obasanjo </p><p>is an embattled president facing a serious impeachment </p><p>threat.  Moreover, his term is up in several months </p><p>and people are telling the Abachas that Obasanjo will </p><p>not be re-elected.  Thus the Abachas\' interests are </p><p>better served by temporizing with Obasanjo while using </p><p>a portion of the money to fund his opposition to </p><p>better ensure Obasanjo\'s defeat.  Given Nigeria\'s </p><p>monetized politics, a portion of the USD 1.2 billion </p><p>would make the Abacha family major stakeholders in the </p><p>upcoming elections.  This would be an ironic, </p><p>unfortunate twist of fate from 1998 when Sani Abacha\'s </p><p>death placed the family in disrepute and opened the </p><p>door to democratic elections that brought Obasanjo to </p><p>office.  End Comment </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
