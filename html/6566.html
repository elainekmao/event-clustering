<p>UNCLAS STATE 072939 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, CASC, KPAO, OIIP, PREL, PTER, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT IN ADDRESS TO THE NATION 19 </p><p>MARCH 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. THE FOLLOWING TEXT IS A TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>REMARKS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MAY BE USED AS TALKING </p><p>POINTS WHEN DISCUSSING THE MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ THAT </p><p>BEGAN 19 MARCH 2003. </p><p> </p><p>2. BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: THE PRESIDENT:  MY FELLOW CITIZENS, </p><p>AT THIS HOUR, AMERICAN AND COALITION FORCES ARE IN THE </p><p>EARLY STAGES OF MILITARY OPERATIONS TO DISARM IRAQ, TO </p><p>FREE ITS PEOPLE AND TO DEFEND THE WORLD FROM GRAVE DANGER. </p><p> </p><p>ON MY ORDERS, COALITION FORCES HAVE BEGUN STRIKING </p><p>SELECTED TARGETS OF MILITARY IMPORTANCE TO UNDERMINE </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S ABILITY TO WAGE WAR.  THESE ARE OPENING </p><p>STAGES OF WHAT WILL BE A BROAD AND CONCERTED CAMPAIGN. </p><p>MORE THAN 35 COUNTRIES ARE GIVING CRUCIAL SUPPORT  -- </p><p>FROM THE USE OF NAVAL AND AIR BASES, TO HELP WITH </p><p>INTELLIGENCE AND LOGISTICS, TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF COMBAT </p><p>UNITS.  EVERY NATION IN THIS COALITION HAS CHOSEN TO BEAR </p><p>THE DUTY AND SHARE THE HONOR OF SERVING IN OUR COMMON </p><p>DEFENSE. </p><p> </p><p>TO ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES </p><p>NOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE PEACE OF A TROUBLED WORLD AND </p><p>THE HOPES OF AN OPPRESSED PEOPLE NOW DEPEND ON YOU.  THAT </p><p>TRUST IS WELL PLACED. </p><p> </p><p>THE ENEMIES YOU CONFRONT WILL COME TO KNOW YOUR SKILL AND </p><p>BRAVERY.  THE PEOPLE YOU LIBERATE WILL WITNESS THE </p><p>HONORABLE AND DECENT SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY.  IN </p><p>THIS CONFLICT, AMERICA FACES AN ENEMY WHO HAS NO REGARD </p><p>FOR CONVENTIONS OF WAR OR RULES OF MORALITY.  SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN HAS PLACED IRAQI TROOPS AND EQUIPMENT IN CIVILIAN </p><p>AREAS, ATTEMPTING TO USE INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN </p><p>AS SHIELDS FOR HIS OWN MILITARY  --  A FINAL ATROCITY </p><p>AGAINST HIS PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>I WANT AMERICANS AND ALL THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT COALITION </p><p>FORCES WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SPARE INNOCENT CIVILIANS </p><p>FROM HARM.  A CAMPAIGN ON THE HARSH TERRAIN OF A NATION AS </p><p>LARGE AS CALIFORNIA COULD BE LONGER AND MORE DIFFICULT </p><p>THAN SOME PREDICT.  AND HELPING IRAQIS ACHIEVE A UNITED, </p><p>STABLE AND FREE COUNTRY WILL REQUIRE OUR SUSTAINED </p><p>COMMITMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WE COME TO IRAQ WITH RESPECT FOR ITS CITIZENS, FOR THEIR </p><p>GREAT CIVILIZATION AND FOR THE RELIGIOUS FAITHS THEY </p><p>PRACTICE.  WE HAVE NO AMBITION IN IRAQ, EXCEPT TO REMOVE A </p><p>THREAT AND RESTORE CONTROL OF THAT COUNTRY TO ITS OWN </p><p>PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>I KNOW THAT THE FAMILIES OF OUR MILITARY ARE PRAYING THAT </p><p>ALL THOSE WHO SERVE WILL RETURN SAFELY AND SOON.  MILLIONS </p><p>OF AMERICANS ARE PRAYING WITH YOU FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR </p><p>LOVED ONES AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INNOCENT.  FOR </p><p>YOUR SACRIFICE, YOU HAVE THE GRATITUDE AND RESPECT OF THE </p><p>AMERICAN PEOPLE.  AND YOU CAN KNOW THAT OUR FORCES WILL BE </p><p>COMING HOME AS SOON AS THEIR WORK IS DONE. </p><p> </p><p>OUR NATION ENTERS THIS CONFLICT RELUCTANTLY  --  YET, OUR </p><p>PURPOSE IS SURE.  THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND OUR </p><p>FRIENDS AND ALLIES WILL NOT LIVE AT THE MERCY OF AN OUTLAW </p><p>REGIME THAT THREATENS THE PEACE WITH WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>MURDER. WE WILL MEET THAT THREAT NOW, WITH OUR ARMY, AIR </p><p>FORCE, NAVY, COAST GUARD AND MARINES, SO THAT WE DO NOT </p><p>HAVE TO MEET IT LATER WITH ARMIES OF FIRE FIGHTERS AND </p><p>POLICE AND DOCTORS ON THE STREETS OF OUR CITIES. </p><p> </p><p>NOW THAT CONFLICT HAS COME, THE ONLY WAY TO LIMIT ITS </p><p>DURATION IS TO APPLY DECISIVE FORCE.  AND I ASSURE YOU, </p><p>THIS WILL NOT BE A CAMPAIGN OF HALF MEASURES, AND WE WILL </p><p>ACCEPT NO OUTCOME BUT VICTORY. </p><p> </p><p>MY FELLOW CITIZENS, THE DANGERS TO OUR COUNTRY AND THE </p><p>WORLD WILL BE OVERCOME.  WE WILL PASS THROUGH THIS TIME OF </p><p>PERIL AND CARRY ON THE WORK OF PEACE.  WE WILL DEFEND OUR </p><p>FREEDOM.  WE WILL BRING FREEDOM TO OTHERS AND WE WILL </p><p>PREVAIL. </p><p> </p><p>MAY GOD BLESS OUR COUNTRY AND ALL WHO DEFEND HER.  END </p><p>TRANSCRIPT. </p><p> </p><p>3. MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
