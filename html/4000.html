COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.    AT A RECENT CONFERENCE IN ITALY ON NORTH KOREAN ENERGY </p><p>NEEDS, THE DPRK DELEGATION APPEARED TO SIGNAL UNUSUAL </p><p>OPENNESS.  ITS PRESENCE AT A CONFERENCE WITH USG AND ROK </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES WAS ITSELF REMARKABLE, AND ITS FRANK </p><p>DISCUSSION OF SHORTCOMINGS AND REFORMS WAS MORE SO.  DPRK </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES HOPED FOR BUT FAILED TO OBTAIN AID </p><p>ASSURANCES.  IN A MEETING AT THE MFA, EAST ASIAN DIRECTOR </p><p>MARIO ROSSO AND INR TDYER ALLISON HOOKER SHARED INFORMATION </p><p>ABOUT THE POSITIVE VISIT BY JAPANESE PM JUNICHIRO KOIZUMI TO </p><p>THE DPRK, AS WELL AS THE USG\'S AND GOI\'S RESPECTIVE CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT PROLIFERATION.  ROSSO OBSERVED THAT THE DPRK\'S CHARM </p><p>OFFENSIVE IS AIMED AT OBTAINING AID, PARTICULARLY FOR A </p><p>TECHNOLOGY CENTER.  THIS ITSELF INDICATES MATURATION ON THE </p><p>PART OF THE REGIME, WHICH APPEARED TO BE SEEKING WAYS TO END </p><p>ITS ISOLATION.  ROSSO REQUESTED ONGOING CONSULTATION WITH THE </p><p>U.S. ON THE DPRK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>CONFERENCE PROVIDES FRANK DISCUSSION ON ENERGY, U.S. POLICY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) INR/EAP TDYER ALLISON HOOKER AND EMBASSY ESTOFF </p><p>LORENZO MARTINI ATTENDED A COMO, ITALY CONFERENCE ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05079  01 OF 02  171439Z </p><p>SEPTEMBER 19 AND 20 ENTITLED "DPR OF KOREA:  UPGRADING AND </p><p>INTEGRATING ENERGY SYSTEMS."  ORGANIZED BY THE LANDAU NETWORK </p><p>OF CENTRO VOLTA (LNCV) AND SUPPORTED BY THE MFA, THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS DESIGNED TO BRING TOGETHER NORTH AND SOUTH </p><p>KOREAN ENERGY EXPERTS WITH WESTERN COUNTERPARTS.  THIS WAS NO </p><p>EASY TASK.  THE ORGANIZATION\'S SECRETARY GENERAL, MAURIZIO </p><p>MARTELLINI, WORKED FOR OVER A YEAR TO GET THE DPRK TO ACCEPT </p><p>HIS INVITATION.  (LNCV IS AN ITALIAN POLICY THINK TANK ON </p><p>ARMS CONTROL, COUNTER-PROLIFERATION AND WMD DISARMAMENT THAT </p><p>FREQUENTLY PROVIDES CONSULTANT CONTRACTOR SERVICES TO THE </p><p>MFA.  IT IS ALSO WORKING ON PROLIFERATION ISSUES IN </p><p>INDIA/PAKISTAN AND IRAN.) </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) HAVING ACCEPTED, HOWEVER, THE DPRK REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>PREPARED THOROUGHLY AND BROUGHT SPECIFIC PROPOSALS BASED ON </p><p>THE LATEST RESEARCH.  MORE THAN ADVICE, THEY WERE HOPING THAT </p><p>WESTERN GOVERNMENTS WOULD FIX THEIR ENERGY PROBLEMS OR AT </p><p>LEAST PROVIDE A $50,000 GOI/EU AID PACKAGE.  THAT WAS NOT TO </p><p>BE.  THE CONFERENCE WAS AIMED AT DISCUSSING POTENTIAL </p><p>TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, NOT INTENSIVE ASSISTANCE.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>THE DPRK REPS SHOWED AN UNUSUALLY OPEN AND FRANK DEMEANOR </p><p>BOTH IN THEIR PRESENTATIONS AND IN SIDELINE DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>HOOKER. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) DURING THE CONFERENCE, A NON-PROFIT AMERICAN THINK </p><p>TANK WAS THE ONLY PARTICIPANT TO RAISE THE SENSITIVE SUBJECT </p><p>OF THE DPRK\'S NUCLEAR ENERGY PROGRAM AND WEAPONS </p><p>PROLIFERATION. </p><p>AT A CONCLUDING ROUNDTABLE, U.S. POLICY WAS TAKEN TO TASK FOR </p><p>DELAYING THE LIGHT WATER REACTOR PROJECT, PUSHING THE NUCLEAR </p><p>AND PROLIFERATION ISSUES, AND PROHIBITING NGO WORK ON DPRK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05079  01 OF 02  171439Z </p><p>ENERGY PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>MFA:  DPRK OPENING TO THE WORLD </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.    IN A SEPTEMBER 24 MEETING WITH MFA DIRECTOR FOR EAST </p><p>ASIAN AFFAIRS RENZO MARIO ROSSO, HOOKER AND ROSSO EXCHANGED </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPENNESS DISPLAYED BY THE DPRK AT THE </p><p>CONFERENCE.  HOOKER NOTED THAT KIM SONG, THE DELEGATION\'S </p><p>HEAD, SET THE EXAMPLE FOR AN UNUSUALLY OPEN DIALOGUE BY </p><p>SPEAKING FRANKLY ABOUT THE DILAPIDATED CONDITION OF THE DPRK </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE.  EACH DPRK PRESENTER DISCUSSED HIS/HER </p><p>RESEARCH FREELY AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS DIRECTLY, WITHOUT </p><p>WAITING FOR GUIDANCE.  MOREOVER, THE DELEGATION SPOKE OPENLY </p><p>ABOUT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, USING THE WORD "REFORM," PERHAPS FOR </p><p>THE FIRST TIME, IN PUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>6.    (C) ROSSO, WHO HAD NOT ATTENDED THE CONFERENCE, SHARED </p><p>INFORMATION WITH HOOKER FROM THE CONFIDENTIAL READOUT HE HAD </p><p>RECEIVED FROM CONFERENCE ORGANIZER MARTELLINI.  THE NORTH </p><p>KOREANS OPPOSED THE CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE LINKING THE </p><p>BUILDING OF LIGHT-WATER REACTORS TO NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS BY </p><p>THE IAEA.  NONETHELESS, THEY SEEMED READY TO ACCEPT THE </p><p>INSPECTORS.  HOOKER NOTED THAT IN HER SIDE CONVERSATIONS WITH </p><p>THE DELEGATION, SHE HEARD THE DPRK WAS LOOKING FOR ASSURANCES </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0050 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05079  02 OF 02  171439Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      C-00     DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     CAC-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03 </p><p>      OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     EPAE-00  SSD-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /017W </p><p>                  ------------------F9328E  171504Z /38 </p><p>R 171355Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6387 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>CIA WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005079 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/17/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ENRG, EAID, PARM, KN, IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05079  02 OF 02  171439Z </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTH KOREANS SIGNAL NEW OPENNESS AT ENERGY </p><p>CONFERENCE IN COMO, ITALY </p><p> </p><p>THAT AFTER INSPECTIONS THE PROJECT WOULD BE COMPLETED WITHOUT </p><p>FURTHER CONDITIONS.  HER NORTH KOREAN INTERLOCUTORS ALSO </p><p>DISCUSSED INTERNAL OPPOSITION TO REFORM, AND THEIR HOPE FOR </p><p>RAPID PROGRESS ON THE ISSUE IN ORDER TO OVERCOME OBJECTIONS </p><p>RAISED BY HARD-LINERS. </p><p> </p><p>7.    (C) RELATIONS BETWEEN THE DPRK AND JAPAN WERE ON THE </p><p>UPSWING AFTER THE VISIT OF KOIZUMI, ROSSO STATED.  IN THE </p><p>OFFING WERE NEW COMMERCIAL DEALS, INFORMATION ABOUT JAPANESE </p><p>ABDUCTEES, AND FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE EXTRADITION TO JAPAN </p><p>OF JAPANESE RED ARMY (JRA) MEMBERS.  ON THE MARGINS OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE, DELEGATION MEMBERS HAD EXPRESSED THEIR HOPE THAT </p><p>THE RETURN OF JRA MEMBERS WOULD RESULT IN THE REMOVAL OF THE </p><p>DPRK FROM THE U.S. LIST OF STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>WHAT IS PYONGYANG AFTER--AND WHAT WILL IT DO TO GET IT? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>8.    (C) ACCORDING TO ROSSO, THE DPRK IS SEEKING AID AND </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, </p><p>AS WELL AS THE ACTIVATION OF A SUBSTANTIAL EU SCHOLARSHIP </p><p>PROGRAM FOR RESEARCHERS.  IN PARTICULAR, PYONGYANG WANTS </p><p>FUNDING TO BUILD A PLANNED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CENTER. </p><p> </p><p>9.    (C) IT APPEARS THAT TO OBTAIN THESE, NORTH KOREA MAY BE </p><p>SEEKING TO ASSUAGE INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT WEAPONS </p><p>PROLIFERATION.  ROSSO RECALLED THAT DURING KOIZUMI\'S VISIT, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05079  02 OF 02  171439Z </p><p>THE DPRK ANNOUNCED A MORATORIUM AFTER 2003 ON ALL MISSILE </p><p>PRODUCTION AND TESTING.  IN EXCHANGE FOR MODERNIZATION AID, </p><p>HE BELIEVES, THE DPRK IS READY TO BAN THE PRODUCTION AND </p><p>EXPORT OF MEDIUM AND LONG-RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILES.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HOOKER NOTED THAT THE USG IS CURRENTLY NOT SUPPORTIVE OF </p><p>PROVIDING COMPENSATION FOR ASSURANCES THAT MISSILE PRODUCTION </p><p>WILL CEASE, AND SAID THAT SHE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY USG PLANS TO </p><p>ASSIST IN BUILDING THE TECHNOLOGY CENTER. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>RESPONDING TO THE NEW AND IMPROVED DPRK </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.   (C) ROSSO AGREED THAT THE TECHNOLOGY CENTER IDEA WAS </p><p>"TOO NEW" BUT OBSERVED THAT THE DIFFUSION OF TECHNOLOGY WAS </p><p>NECESSARY FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION.  THE FACT </p><p>THAT PYONGYANG WAS PURSUING THIS APPROACH INDICATED THAT </p><p>EITHER THE REGIME WAS MORE CONFIDENT THAN BEFORE OR HAD </p><p>REALIZED THAT TECHNOLOGY WAS IN ITS INTERESTS.  HOOKER </p><p>OBSERVED THAT OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS RUSSIA, WERE </p><p>INTERESTED IN VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR NORTH KOREA </p><p>BUT FINDING MONEY FOR THOSE PROJECTS WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM. </p><p>HOWEVER, BECAUSE NORTH KOREA HAD BEEN WILLING TO RESPOND TO </p><p>JAPANESE CONCERNS ABOUT ABDUCTEES, JAPAN MIGHT BE WILLING TO </p><p>PUSH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK TO FUND DPRK PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>11.   (C) ROSSO STATED THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN PERIODICALLY </p><p>CONSULTING AND COORDINATING POLICIES ON THE DPRK, GIVING </p><p>HOOKER AN OPENING TO ASK WHY NORTH KOREA WAS IMPORTANT TO </p><p>ITALY.  GIVING HIS "PERSONAL OPINION," ROSSO REPLIED THAT </p><p>ORIGINALLY THE IDEA OF NEW DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS (I.E., </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05079  02 OF 02  171439Z </p><p>OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZING THE DPRK) WAS A BIPARTISAN ONE LED BY </p><p>THE FORMER CENTER-LEFT FONMIN, LAMBERTO DINI.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>CURRENT CENTER-RIGHT GOVERNMENT WAS COOLER TO NORTH KOREA, </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT CONTRADICTING THE U.S. STAND ON THE "AXIS OF </p><p>EVIL," AND THUS NOT PARTICULARLY ENGAGED.  AN MFA OFFICER WHO </p><p>JOINED THE MEETING BRIEFLY ADDED THAT EUROPE WAS TRYING TO </p><p>FIND A STRATEGY IN RESPONSE TO THAT DECLARATION.  THE </p><p>QUESTION WAS WHETHER TO TRY TO BALANCE PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>APPROACH OR SUPPORT IT.  ROSSO AGREED THAT THE EU POLICY WAS </p><p>IN FLUX.  IN THE PAST, THE EU\'S ROLE WAS TO PURSUE DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH THE DPRK.  "IT WAS THE BEST WE COULD DO AT THE TIME," HE </p><p>SAID. </p><p> </p><p>12.   (C) IN CONTRAST TO THE PERIOD OF OVER A YEAR IN WHICH </p><p>THE DPRK SITUATION WAS PRACTICALLY STUCK, ROSSO SUMMARIZED, </p><p>NOW NORTH KOREA WAS GIVING POSITIVE SIGNALS AND SEEKING </p><p>DIALOGUE AND REESTABLISHED LINKS WITH SOUTH KOREA.  WHILE </p><p>THIS AND KOIZUMI\'S VISIT SUGGEST A THAWING, SETBACKS COULD </p><p>STILL EMERGE.  HOOKER AGREED, REMEMBERING THE NAVAL CLASH </p><p>WITH SOUTH KOREA ON JUNE 29 THAT PROBABLY DISRUPTED THE </p><p>DPRK\'S PLANS TO ANNOUNCE CHANGES.  SHE STATED THAT POLICY </p><p>MAKERS HAVE BEEN WATCHING WITH INTEREST THE RECENT CHANGES IN </p><p>THE DPRK AND CONSIDERING HOW TO MOVE AHEAD WITH US-DPRK </p><p>RELATIONS.  NOTING THAT THE GOI AND PRC HAD RECENTLY AGREED </p><p>TO SHARE INFORMATION ON THE DPRK, ROSSO REPEATED THAT HE </p><p>HOPES TO CONTINUE CONSULTATIONS WITH US AS WELL. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05079 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
