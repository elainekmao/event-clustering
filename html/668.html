SEOUL 57989  B. TOKYO 9565 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  THE DEATH OF KIM IL SUNG HAS MONOPOLIZED </p><p>MEDIA, GOVERNMENT, AND PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS IN SOUTH KOREA </p><p>SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON JULY 9.  ROKG POLICY PLANNERS </p><p>CONTINUE TO DISCUSS OFFICIAL REACTIONS, INCLUDING AT A </p><p>PRIME MINISTER-CHAIRED POLICY COORDINATION MEETING TODAY. </p><p>FM HAN SUNG JOO TOLD US THAT THE ROKG EXPECTS PYONGYANG TO </p><p>SEEK A SOUTH-NORTH SUMMIT AS SOON AS THE SUCCESSION IS </p><p>SETTLED.  THE ROK WILL BE WILLING TO DISCUSS ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>FOR A SUMMIT AFTER THAT HAPPENS.  DOMESTIC POLITICAL </p><p>REACTION HAS SUPPORTED THE ADMINISTRATION TO DATE, WITH </p><p>MOST POLITICIANS STATING THEIR BELIEF THAT KIM JONG IL </p><p>WILL CONTINUE THE POLICIES OF HIS FATHER, IN ORDER TO LEND </p><p>LEGITIMACY TO HIS RULE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER HAN\'S VIEWS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  AS EXPECTED BOTH KOREAS CONTINUE TO BE FULLY ABSORBED </p><p>BY THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEATH OF KIM IL SUNG.  DURING A </p><p>LATE AFTERNOON MEETING WITH CHARGE (SEPTEL), FM HAN SUNG </p><p>JOO CONFIRMED ROKG RECEIPT OF DPRK WORKERS PARTY SECRETARY </p><p>KIM YOUNG SUN\'S LETTER EXPRESSING DPRK DESIRE TO POSTPONE </p><p>THE PLANNED JUNE 25-27 SUMMIT.  HAN TOLD CHARGE THAT THE </p><p>ROKG IN ITS RESPONSE WILL EXPRESS ITS COMMITMENT TO THE </p><p>"SPIRIT AND PRINCIPLE" OF THE SUMMIT AGREEMENT, AND THAT </p><p>ONCE THE SITUATION STABILIZES AND THE ROKG KNOWS WHO IS IN </p><p>CHARGE IN NORTH KOREA THE ROKG WILL BE WILLING TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF A SUMMIT.  HAN PREDICTED THAT THE NORTH </p><p>KOREANS WOULD WANT TO QUICKLY ESTABLISH A DATE FOR THE </p><p>SUMMIT; THE ROK WOULD NOT BE IN A HURRY, HE SAID, ALTHOUGH </p><p>SEOUL WOULD NOT REFUSE OR UNNECESSARILY DELAY SUCH A </p><p>MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN RESPONSE TO CHARGE\'S QUERY, HAN SAID THAT THE ROKG </p><p>HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE OTHER THAN KIM JONG </p><p>IL WOULD ASSUME POWER IN NORTH KOREA.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT KIM MIGHT ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR MEETING FOREIGNERS TO SOMEONE ELSE, GIVEN KIM\'S </p><p>COMPLETE LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS REGARD.  IN THIS </p><p>CONTEXT, HAN NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS SPECULATION </p><p>THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SEPARATE HEAD OF STATE VERSUS LEADER </p><p>OF THE PARTY, THE ROKG INCLINATION WAS TO BELIEVE THAT KIM </p><p>WOULD ASSUME BOTH POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FINALLY, HAN COMMENTED ON THE EXISTENCE OF </p><p>AUTHORITATIVE VOICES IN THE KOREAN GOVERNMENT WHO WOULD </p><p>PREFER A MORE MEASURED USG APPROACH TOWARD NORTH KOREA TO </p><p>AVOID ENABLING PYONGYANG TO FEEL OVERCONFIDENT ABOUT ITS </p><p>NEW POSITION IN THE AFTERMATH OF KIM IL SUNG\'S DEATH. </p><p>STRESSING THE UNUSUAL PSYCHOLOGY OF THE REGIME IN </p><p>PYONGYANG, HAN CITED THE EXAMPLE OF OUR EXTENSION OF </p><p>CONDOLENCES TO THE KOREAN PEOPLE AS SOMETHING THE REGIME </p><p>MIGHT MISREAD IN A WAY TO DIMINISH THE RESPECT PYONGYANG </p><p>MIGHT HOLD FOR US IN OUR FUTURE DEALINGS.  HAN ALSO CITED </p><p>HIS VIEW THAT IT WAS USEFUL FOR CHINA TO MAINTAIN GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE NEW REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT.  HAN IS FEELING SOME PRESSURE, PERHAPS FROM </p><p>MND, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EXPRESSION OF CONDOLENCES.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED THE KOREANS AS SPLIT BETWEEN THOSE WHO REVILE </p><p>KIM AND THOSE WHO ARE MORE FORWARD-LOOKING.  THE FORMER </p><p>MAY BLAME HIM FOR NOT PREVENTING ANY EXPRESSION OF </p><p>CONDOLENCE FROM THE U.S.  HAN\'S COVERSATION WITH SECRETARY </p><p>OF STATE CHRISTOPER HELPED HIM, AND THERE MAY BE AN EFFORT </p><p>TO HAVE PRESIDENT KIM SPEAK TO PRESIDENT CLINTON ON THE </p><p>TELEPHONE LATER IN THE WEEK.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT NEXT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  SOUTH KOREAN MEDIA HAVE CONCENTRATED ON ALL ASPECTS OF </p><p>THE ISSUE TO THE VIRTUAL EXCLUSION OF OTHER STORIES, WHILE </p><p>THE NORTH IS STEEPED IN MOURNING AND, PRESUMABLY, </p><p>BEHIND-THE-SCENES CONSOLIDATION OF POLITICAL POWER AROUND </p><p>HEIR-APPARENT KIM JONG IL.  THE DPRK HAS YET TO MAKE A </p><p>MAJOR POLICY STATEMENT SINCE THE SENIOR KIM\'S DEATH. </p><p>ANALYSTS IN SOUTH KOREA PREDICTED SUCH A STATEMENT WILL BE </p><p>MADE WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  KIM IL SUNG\'S FUNERAL WILL BE HELD ON JUL 17, WITH NO </p><p>FOREIGN DELEGATIONS EXPECTED TO BE INVITED OR ALLOWED. </p><p>THE DPRK REFUSED AN OFFER OF A "CONDOLENCE VISIT" FROM </p><p>PRESIDENT CARTER (THEN IN TOKYO) ON SATURDAY (REF B), </p><p>ALTHOUGH YONHAP REPORTED JULY 11 THAT THE DPRK INTENDS TO </p><p>INVITE PRESIDENT CARTER TO THE FUNERAL.)  A SENIOR ROKG </p><p>OFFICIAL SPECULATED THAT THE DPRK MAY EXCLUDE FOREIGN </p><p>DELEGATIONS BECAUSE IT IS AFRAID THAT IF INVITED, THEY </p><p>WILL NOT COME, THUS EXPOSING TO THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE </p><p>THE LIE OF KIM IL SUNG AS A WORLD-REVERED GREAT LEADER. </p><p> </p><p>KIM JONG IL SUCCESSION PROGRESSES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  KIM JONG IL HAS NOT YET APPEARED IN PUBLIC, NOR HAS </p><p>THERE BEEN A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS SUCCESSION TO THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE DPRK.  NEVERTHELESS, INDICATIONS </p><p>CONTINUE TO PILE UP THAT THE TRANSFER OF POWER TO KIM IL </p><p>SUNG\'S OLDEST SON AND HEIR APPARENT IS PROCEEDING.  DPRK </p><p>MEDIA HAVE PRODUCED A STEADY STREAM OF LAUDATORY COMMENTS </p><p>ON THE JUNIOR KIM, AS WELL AS PUBLIC PLEDGES OF LOYALTY BY </p><p>VARIOUS OFFICIALS OF THE DPRK GOVERNMENT AND PARTY </p><p>HIERARCHY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ALL MEMBERS OF THE WORKERS PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>AND THE SUPREME PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY WERE TOLD TO GATHER IN </p><p>PYONGYANG BY JULY 11 FOR CONDOLENCES.  IT WOULD BE </p><p>REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THEY WILL ELECT KIM JONG IL TO </p><p>THE TWO TOP POSITIONS OF PRESIDENT AND WORKERS PARTY </p><p>SECRETARY.  (OF COURSE, HE ALREADY HOLDS THE THIRD TOP </p><p>POSITION OF CHAIRMAN OF THE MILITARY AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OF </p><p>THE WORKERS PARTY.) </p><p> </p><p>NORTH-SOUTH SUMMIT "POSTPONED" </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  ON THE MORNING OF JULY 11, THE DPRK SENT A VERY BRIEF </p><p>MESSAGE TO THE ROKG STATING THAT IN LIGHT OF KIM IL SUNG\'S </p><p>DEATH, THE SUMMIT "COULD NOT BUT BE POSTPONED."  THE </p><p>MESSAGE WAS SENT TO ROK DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FOR </p><p>UNIFICATION LEE HONG-KU FROM HIS COUNTERPART AT THE </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL TALKS OF JUNE 28, DPRK WORKERS PARTY SECRETARY </p><p>KIM YOUNG-SUN. </p><p> </p><p>12.  DURING A BRIEFING FOR THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS HELD ON </p><p>MONDAY AFTERNOON, ASSISTANT MINISTER CHOI DONG JIN </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE ROKG\'S BASIC PRINCIPLES ON PEACE, </p><p>SECURITY AND COOPERATION ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA REMAIN </p><p>THE SAME, AND THE ROK LEADERSHIP HOPES THAT BOTH SIDES CAN </p><p>RESUME PLANNING FOR A SUMMIT "IF OR WHEN A NEW ENVIRONMENT </p><p>IS CREATED THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO HOLDING A SUMMIT." </p><p> </p><p>13.  ROKG PUBLIC STATEMENTS HAVE CONTINUALLY STRESSED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CONFIDENCE IN ITS READINESS TO RESPOND TO ALL </p><p>EVENTUALITIES.  APPEARING BEFORE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON </p><p>JULY 11, DPM LEE PREDICTED A "QUIET FRONT" IN THE DPRK </p><p>WHILE THE TRANSFER OF POWER IS COMPLETED AND THE NEW </p><p>REGIME STABILIZED.  HE FORESAW NO MAJOR CHANGES IN </p><p>NORTH-SOUTH RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>DOMESTIC POLITICAL REACTION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>14.  A STAFF ASSISTANT TO FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE </p><p>AND OPPOSITION LEADER KIM DAE JUNG SPOKE WITH POLOFF TODAY </p><p>AND LAID OUT KIM\'S ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>NORTH.  KIM BELIEVES THAT KIM JONG IL WILL STAY WITH THE </p><p>COURSE SET BY HIS FATHER, AS THIS WILL BE THE SUREST WAY </p><p>TO LEGITIMIZE HIS RULE.  IF HE IS INCLINED TO PURSUE HIS </p><p>OWN POLICIES, HE WILL NOT DO SO UNTIL HE FIRMLY </p><p>ESTABLISHES HIS RULE. </p><p> </p><p>15.  KIM DAE JUNG SEES TWO PRIORITIES FOR KIM JONG IL ONCE </p><p>HE ASSUMES POWER.  HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WILL BE TO </p><p>RESUME TALKS WITH THE USG, BECAUSE OF THE INSPECTION </p><p>DEADLINE RELATING TO THE SPENT FUEL RODS.  SECONDLY, KIM </p><p>WILL NEED TO IMPROVE HIS CREDIBILITY AS A LEADER BY </p><p>PROVIDING IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE PEOPLE.  THE </p><p>EASIEST WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WOULD BE TO IMPROVE </p><p>ECONOMIC TIES WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.  THUS, KIM DAE JUNG </p><p>IS OPTIMISTIC THAT KIM JONG IL WILL CONTINUE DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>THE US., WITH THE HOPE OF OBTAINING ECONOMIC </p><p>CONCESSIONS.  THE CHIEF OBSTACLE KIM SEES AT THE MOMENT, </p><p>HOWEVER, IS THE ROKG.  KIM IS CONCERNED THAT THE SOUTH MAY </p><p>SEIZE THIS PERIOD AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE DPRK, AND </p><p>ADD MORE CONDITIONS TO THE TALKS.  IF SO, KIM BELIEVES </p><p>THAT RATHER THAN ACQUIESCE TO FURTHER DEMANDS, THE NORTH </p><p>WOULD RETRENCH, AND HOPES FOR A RESOLUTION OF THE NUCLEAR </p><p>PROBLEM WOULD BE RUINED. </p><p> </p><p>16.  REP. PARK CHUNG SOO, A RULING DEMOCRATIC LIBERAL </p><p>PARTY (DLP) ASSEMBLYMAN, AND MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE, SPOKE WITH POLOFF AND ECHOED KIM DAE JUNG\'S </p><p>ANALYSIS.  ADDITIONALLY, PARK STATED THAT THE PARTY FELT </p><p>THAT IF AND WHEN NORTH KOREA PROPOSES ANOTHER SUMMIT, THE </p><p>FORMAT MUST BE REEVALUATED COMPLETELY.  ALTHOUGH MEMBERS </p><p>SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF A SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG IL, IT WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO BE HELD IN ANOTHER LOCATION, AND WITH A DIFFERENT </p><p>AGENDA. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>STATEMENT BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>17.  THE MAIN OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC PARTY (DP) PROVIDED </p><p>THE EMBASSY WITH THE FOLLOWING ENGLISH TEXT ON THE </p><p>AFTERNOON OF JULY 11: </p><p> </p><p>"1.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE AND </p><p>NEGOTIATION POSITIVELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASIC </p><p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN SOUTH AND NORTH KOREA FOR SUMMIT TALKS. </p><p>THOUGH THERE COULD BE SOME DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION AND </p><p>OPINIONS ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NORTH KOREA\'S REGIME, IT </p><p>IS UNDER THE CONTEXT THAT REGIME UNDER KIM JONG IL COULD </p><p>STILL BE THE OBJECT OF NEGOTIATION AND DIALOGUE WHEN THE </p><p>KIM JONG IL\'S REGIME WILL BE IN POWER IN THE CASE OF LATE </p><p>KIM IL SUNG. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO REFRAIN FROM ANY PROVOCATIVE </p><p>ACTIONS OF POLITICAL AND MILITARY AREAS AGAINST NORTH </p><p>KOREA UNTIL NORTH KOREA RESTORES THE PEACE WITHIN THE </p><p>REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO SHOW ANY POSTURE WHICH </p><p>MAY INFLUENCE ON NORTH KOREA\'S POWER FORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>(ISSUED BY THE FOREIGN RELATION\'S COMMITTEE OF THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PARTY.)" </p><p> </p><p>18.  COMMENT:  THE INSISTENCE BY THE DP THAT THE SUMMIT GO </p><p>AHEAD AS SCHEDULED RUNS AT ODDS WITH PUBLIC SENTIMENT. </p><p>SOUTH KOREANS DO NOT HOLD A SOFT SPOT FOR THE YOUNGER KIM, </p><p>AND A TRIP BY KIM YOUNG SAM TO PYONGYANG TO MEET WITH </p><p>SOMEONE HIS JUNIOR IN BOTH AGE AND LEADERSHIP TENURE WOULD </p><p>INVITE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC CRITICISM.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>QUOTE OF THE DAY </p><p>---------------- </p><p>19.  EMBOFF WAS TOLD BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER IS NOW REFERRED TO IN ROKG CIRCLES </p><p>AS "THE ANGEL OF DEATH." </p><p> </p><p>KARTMAN UNQUOTE </p><p> </p><p>TALBOTT </p><p></p></div>
