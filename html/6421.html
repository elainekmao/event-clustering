<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000503 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP (GGLASS), S/CT (FOX), NEA (GRAPO AND </p><p>HEFFERNAN), TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL (DAUFHAUSER), OFAC </p><p>DIRECTOR (RNEWCOMB), DAS FOR TERRORISM AND VIOLENT CRIMES </p><p>(JZARATE), AND TASK FORCE ON TERRORISM FINANCING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, ETTC, EFIN, PTER, PREL, KVPR, YM, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: NEXT STEPS REGARDING SABAA BANK </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2002 STATE 252456 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB: EJHULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Embassy Sanaa has now reviewed the targeting </p><p>report noted in para three/reftel.  While the report cited </p><p>several disturbing examples that may implicate Saba Islamic </p><p>Bank (SIB) in supporting terrorist financing, the report also </p><p>stated that the USG had information only on a few specific </p><p>transactions through SIB by terrorists and that these did not </p><p>specify complicity of bank officials.  Embassy Sanaa believes </p><p>that it would not/not be prudent to designate SIB without </p><p>more and better information to substantiate its possible role </p><p>in terrorist financing. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Embassy Sanaa will review and follow up on the </p><p>various sub-reports cited in the targeting report; we note </p><p>that these were submitted over several years and may involve </p><p>issues of context, changed circumstances, and information </p><p>overtaken by events.  We will seek additional,up-to-date </p><p>information on the ownership of SIB and the activities of </p><p>Hamid Al-Ahmar in particular. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) We assume as well that U.S. investigators working </p><p>the cases of Sheikh Mohammed Hasan Ali Al-Moayad and the </p><p>so-called "Yemeni money-laundering" ring in the U.S. will be </p><p>seeking any information that might substantiate SIB and </p><p>Al-Ahmar activities in terrorist financing.  We note that the </p><p>targeting report, which was compiled prior to the arrest of </p><p>Sheikh Al-Moayad and to publication of news about the </p><p>money-laundering case, made reference to both of these. </p><p>Further investigation along these lines may therefore be </p><p>directly relevant. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) As Embassy Sanaa noted in our previous message on </p><p>this issue (2002 Sanaa 3726), we believe that designation of </p><p>Shaykh \'Abd al-Majid Al-Zindani could serve U.S. </p><p>counter-terrorism interests, especially if we can tie him to </p><p>Al-Qa\'ida, and get UN endorsement.  Our belief is that USG </p><p>efforts should give primary focus to Shaykh Al-Zindani\'s </p><p>history and activities, and that this is more likely to </p><p>produce results that could lead to ROYG decisions in our </p><p>mutual interests.  Hamid Al-Ahmar and Sabaa Islamic Bank may </p><p>be secondary/secondary targets for subsequent action as </p><p>further supporting information becomes available. In any </p><p>event, prior to possible designation of Al-Zindani, Hamid </p><p>Al-Ahmar, and/or Sabaa Islamic Bank, we need to develop </p><p>additional evidence, and follow where that evidence may lead </p><p>with appropriate decisions. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
