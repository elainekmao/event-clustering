HARARE 1097 </p><p>     B. HARARE 1081 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The MDC planned stayaway has been largely successful </p><p>with 80 - 95% of shops and businesses closed on June 2 in </p><p>Harare and Bulawayo.  There was very visible police and </p><p>military presence in both cities starting on May 31, with </p><p>several arrests and a few reports of beatings.  ZANU-PF </p><p>members distributed leaflets throughout Harare encouraging </p><p>people to go to work, and the police obtained a High Court </p><p>ruling on May 31 outlawing the mass action.  Police arrested </p><p>and released MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai.  GOZ forceful </p><p>counter measures have succeeded in preventing demonstrations </p><p>so far, and leave Mugabe as entrenched as ever after day one </p><p>of this mass action, albeit sitting on an increasingly </p><p>fragile economic and political situation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Riot Police Disperse Students </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) By about 11:00 a.m. riot police with shields and </p><p>helmets had dispersed a few hundred students at the </p><p>University of Zimbabwe campus with tear gas.  Gate guards at </p><p>the University\'s several entrances refused to allow any </p><p>vehicles to enter campus citing the disturbance, and police </p><p>later confined students to their dormitories.  According to a </p><p>student organizer, the students planned to assemble on campus </p><p>and march to the city center to join with marchers. </p><p> </p><p>Two Deaths? </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) There were several unconfirmed reports that police </p><p>shot at least three people at a demonstration in the </p><p>high-density suburb of Highfield.  Two were reportedly </p><p>killed; one was wounded and is said to be currently receiving </p><p>treatment at a local clinic. </p><p> </p><p>Intimidating Police and Military Presence </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) During the morning of June 2 there were several other </p><p>reports that hundreds and sometimes even thousands of people </p><p>were gathering at various locations in the Harare area in </p><p>order to demonstrate.  Poloffs investigated several of these </p><p>locations as the reports surfaced and found no increased </p><p>crowds present.  At some of these locations there were </p><p>significant police presences. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Over the weekend May 31 - June 1 convoys of tanks and </p><p>military vehicles were seen traveling around various areas of </p><p>Harare.  According to MDC Presidential Advisor Gandi </p><p>Mudzingwa, the vehicles, loaded with soldiers, would </p><p>generally travel around the high-density suburbs at night and </p><p>return to their barracks during the day.  Emboffs observed </p><p>mounted police patrols during daylight hours on both May 31 </p><p>and June 2. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Poloffs observed groups of 5 - 8 police officers on </p><p>many blocks throughout downtown Harare in the morning of June </p><p>2.  In Africa Unity Square, the proposed location of a </p><p>demonstration, Poloffs observed a group of at least 15 </p><p>officers.  RSO later observed police beating about 30 - 40 </p><p>people they had detained and had ordered to lay face down on </p><p>the sidewalk near the Square.  According to Mudzingwa, the </p><p>MDC had planned a large demonstration at the Square, but had </p><p>subsequently canceled it because transport was not </p><p>functioning to bring enough attendees into town. </p><p> </p><p>Disturbances Downtown </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) During clashes with what appeared to be MDC youth, </p><p>police in downtown Harare fired tear gas in the morning of </p><p>June 2.  The Embassy\'s PAS office, located near the MDC\'s </p><p>headquarters, was contemplating closure at midday on June 2 </p><p>due to these disturbances, but ultimately remained open. </p><p>Also located downtown, the Swedish Embassy closed at </p><p>mid-morning on June 2 due to similar fears. </p><p> </p><p>Bulawayo: Demonstrators Dispersed, Stayaway Successful </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>8. (SBU) According to Sheba Dube, head of the Bulawayo </p><p>chapter of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA), in Bulawayo, </p><p>police were present since the early hours of June 2 at </p><p>Queen\'s Park in the downtown area - the site of a planned </p><p>demonstration.  Although about 200 people did gather police </p><p>reportedly disbursed the crowd beating several people in the </p><p>process.  Police also arrested about ten MDC officials and </p><p>activists from around the Bulawayo area on June 1 - 2; many </p><p>were still in custody in the afternoon of June 2. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Dube reported that many shops and businesses in </p><p>Bulawayo were reportedly closed in the morning, but some </p><p>grocery stores opened in the afternoon of June 2.  In general </p><p>more than 80% of businesses remained closed with very light </p><p>pedestrian and vehicle traffic present in downtown Bulawayo. </p><p> </p><p>GOZ Counter-Measures </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) In addition to obtaining the May 31 High Court ruling </p><p>outlawing the planned mass action, the GOZ also printed and </p><p>distributed leaflets encouraging Zimbabweans to ignore the </p><p>stayaway.  In the days before the mass action, the government </p><p>press reported that the GOZ would revoke business licenses of </p><p>companies that did not open and that anyone demonstrating </p><p>would be defying the High Court order.  The GOZ propaganda </p><p>machine also gave major publicity to war-vet threats to </p><p>demonstrators. </p><p> </p><p>Police Arrest MDC Leaders </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) In addition to the arrest of MDC President Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai on the morning of June 2, around midday police </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>arrested MDC Shadow Minister of Home Affairs, Tendai Biti. </p><p>Tsvangirai was charged with contempt of court for going ahead </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>with the mass action, there was no confirmation of charges </p><p>against Biti at the time of writing.  Police actually </p><p>released Tsvangirai so that he could attend his treason trial </p><p>at 10:00 on June 2.  There were unconfirmed reports that a </p><p>few MDC officials in Bulawayo, and a few MDC MPs in Harare </p><p>were also arrested. </p><p> </p><p>Stayaway Successful </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Although there were a fair number of people milling </p><p>around downtown Harare on the morning of June 2, Poloffs saw </p><p>almost no shops open, and only a handful of business open. </p><p>Some public busses were running but the commuter bus pick-up </p><p>areas had about 15% of the normal crowd present.  Other </p><p>Emboffs traveled around downtown Harare on the afternoon of </p><p>June 2 and found almost no one present. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) By deploying tanks and other intimidating military </p><p>hardware and personnel in the Harare area, the GOZ has </p><p>succeeded so far in quashing nascent gatherings that could </p><p>turn into marches or demonstrations before they have really </p><p>gained momentum.  The MDC is likely to claim victory for the </p><p>stayaway and for the gatherings that were supposed to be </p><p>demonstrations, but nothing has yet happened on a massive </p><p>scale that would boost public confidence that the time is </p><p>shortening for the Mugabe regime.  While it is likely the </p><p>stayaway will continue for a few more days, and </p><p>demonstrations are still possible, the GOZ has demonstrated </p><p>on day one, for its part, that it will use whatever force is </p><p>necessary to assure that no serious threat to its power can </p><p>gain momentum.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
