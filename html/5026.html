Turkish </p><p>officials recalled the dispute between Turkey and Britain </p><p>over Iraqi oil in 1924, and assessed that the nation\'s </p><p>sensitivity prevented them from allowing Turkish facilities </p><p>to be used by the UK.  "Radikal" believes that Hoon was not </p><p>given a clear response, and that TGS told him that the </p><p>decision would be made by the government.  "Sabah" says that </p><p>Hoon has asked for transit passage of 10,000 British troops </p><p>to Northern Iraq via Turkey.  "Milliyet" claims that UK </p><p>officials urged Ankara to make a decision before January 27, </p><p>warning that if Turkey refuses to join the international </p><p>coalition, its role in restructuring a future Iraq would be </p><p>diminished.  Dailies echo U.S. disappointment over Turkey\'s </p><p>reluctance for cooperation against Iraq.  The U.S. is also </p><p>upset about the upcoming Turkish delegation trip to Baghdad, </p><p>and Prime Minister Gul\'s recent Middle East tour, reports </p><p>say.  "Milliyet" quotes Washington sources as complaining </p><p>that compared to Turkey, Arab countries have taken a clearer </p><p>and more positive position on the issue.  The same sources </p><p>said that the Congress might react to Turkish non- </p><p>cooperation by blocking financial assistance with Turkey. </p><p>"Vatan" reports a senior State Department official as saying </p><p>that  Turkey will be denied a share in Iraq\'s </p><p>reconstruction, and won\'t be allowed to continue military </p><p>incursions into Northern Iraq.  "Cumhuriyet" says that </p><p>Ankara has presented Washington a list of prospective </p><p>Turkish support in the event of war.  The U.S. will be able </p><p>to use Turkish bases and ports, but will not be allowed to </p><p>station large numbers of troops.  The `modus operandi\' for </p><p>site surveys will be agreed soon, and 150 U.S. experts will </p><p>begin inspections, according to Cumhuriyet.  Meanwhile, </p><p>Northern Iraqi KDP leader Barzani arrived in Ankara on </p><p>Wednesday for talks.  "Zaman" comments that Turkey\'s </p><p>military presence in Northern Iraq was covered extensively </p><p>by the press, and no international reaction came.  Turkey, </p><p>backed by the U.S. and UK over the issue of Iraq\'s </p><p>territorial integrity, is now in a strong position to </p><p>question Barzani regarding Kurdish intentions for a federal </p><p>Iraq, and the status of the Turkomen, Zaman reports. </p><p>"Radikal" claims that the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs </p><p>of Staff, General Richard Myers, will visit Turkey on </p><p>January 24.  Dailies expect Gen. Myers to demand a clear </p><p>response from Ankara regarding the use of bases and ports, </p><p>and note that the U.S. sees the Myers visit as the last </p><p>chance for working out a compromise with Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Papers report that Turkey has made `historic\' </p><p>changes to its Cyprus policy by abandoning plans of </p><p>integration with the Turkish Cypriot sector.  AKP\'s new </p><p>Cyprus approach has dictated changes at the MFA, according </p><p>to the reports.  An MFA spokesman said on Wednesday that the </p><p>government will make new arrangements within the framework </p><p>of negotiations on the UN-sponsored Cyprus plan.  Papers </p><p>report that the Greek Cypriot Administration has welcomed </p><p>Turkey\'s declaration of change, and urged rapid </p><p>implementation.  Papers also report Turkish Cypriot leader </p><p>Denktas as saying that the economic imbalance between Turks </p><p>and Greeks on the island requires that any  agreement on </p><p>Cyprus should not be implemented before Turkey achieves full </p><p>EU membership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TGS Chief slams Gul: Dailies extensively cover TGS Chief </p><p>General Ozkok\'s warning to  Prime Minister Gul for allegedly </p><p>`encouraging fundamentalists.\'  Papers say that the military </p><p>is responding to Gul\'s stated objections to the TGS decision </p><p>to expel fundamentalist officers from the army at the High </p><p>Military Council (YAS) meetings in December.  Prime Minister </p><p>Gul and Defense Minister Gonul have signed the YAS decision </p><p>to expel fundamentalist officers, with a protest note </p><p>claiming that decisions taken by the military council should </p><p>be open for appeal in the courts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Plane crash: A Turkish Airlines (THY) RJ-100 passenger plane </p><p>crashed while trying to land in Diyarbakir airport in thick </p><p>fog, killing 75 of the 80 passengers and crew on board. </p><p>Reports see the reason for the crash as the lack of </p><p>Instrument Landing System (ILS) equipment in Diyarbakir. </p><p>Such equipment enables planes to land in unsuitable weather </p><p>conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"US implicitly threatens Turkey" </p><p>Yasemin Congar wrote from Washington in mass appeal </p><p>"Milliyet" (1/9): "Turkey\'s decision to wait for the UN </p><p>report before determining the extent of its cooperation with </p><p>the US has caused a potential problem between the two </p><p>countries.  Washington is disappointed both in Ankara\'s </p><p>current Iraq policy as well as the decision to send a </p><p>Turkish trade delegation headed by State Minister Tuzmen to </p><p>Baghdad.  Officials in Washington note that this </p><p>disappointment could be reflected when Congress takes up the </p><p>issues of economic, military, and commercial aid to Turkey. </p><p>A US diplomatic source warns that `the degree of US </p><p>cooperation with the Arab world seems to becoming more </p><p>significant than with Turkey.\'  . Sources close to the </p><p>Washington administration comment that due to Ankara\'s </p><p>reservations and `wait-and-see\' attitude, the goal of </p><p>creating a deterrent show of force against Iraq has not been </p><p>achieved.  It seems that the visit of General Myers to </p><p>Ankara will play a determining factor for Washington in </p><p>deciding whether or not to include the northern front in the </p><p>war scenario." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What kind of policy?" </p><p>Sami Kohen criticized in mass appeal Milliyet (1/9): "It is </p><p>quite possible to believe that the AKP government does not </p><p>have an Iraq policy.  There are many conflicting statements </p><p>from various official bodies, and it is mind-boggling to try </p><p>to figure out which is the real policy. . On the other hand, </p><p>we should also see that developments related to Iraq have </p><p>caught the government in a helpless position.  The `great </p><p>advantage\' of Turkey, its geo-strategic location, has now </p><p>become a painful liability for Ankara.  Because of Turkey\'s </p><p>location and political ties, as well as its current economic </p><p>situation, it is not possible to define Turkey\'s role with a </p><p>`yes-or-no\' kind of clarity.  Thus Ankara is trying to shape </p><p>its policy based on developments, keeping its options open </p><p>and maintaining flexibility. . Turkish officials note that </p><p>Ankara does not want to hurry, but that the plan for a front </p><p>in northern Iraq will be taken into consideration `when the </p><p>time comes.\'  Reacting to Washington\'s complaints about </p><p>Turkey\'s position, one Turkish official said that the </p><p>problem stems from the definition of time limits.  Ankara </p><p>wants to shape things in the course of time, while </p><p>Washington is asking for an immediate answer." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
