<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000205 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PD, NEA/NGA; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  02-06-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAO, CE, MV, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  Low key reaction to Secretary\'s UN Security </p><p>Council speech on Iraq so far in Sri Lanka and Maldives </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 185 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 170 </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 24 </p><p>-      (D) 02 Colombo 1879, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Reaction to the Secretary\'s speech to </p><p>the UN Security Council has been low key in Sri Lanka </p><p>and the Maldives.  Press coverage was limited to wire- </p><p>service reports.  Neither the GSL nor GoRM have issued </p><p>public statements as of yet.  With the speech wrapping </p><p>up very late February 5 local time, our assessment is </p><p>that reaction will take several days to roll in.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Reaction to the Secretary\'s speech to the UN </p><p>Security Council has been low key in Sri Lanka and the </p><p>Maldives, thus far.  The speech wrapped up very late </p><p>February 5 local time.  Our assessment is that its </p><p>contents are just being digested and that reaction will </p><p>take time to develop. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) OFFICIAL REACTION:  We have checked with Sri </p><p>Lankan MFA and Office of the Prime Minister contacts, </p><p>and they report that the GSL has not developed an </p><p>official reaction to the speech as of yet.  (Note:  Last </p><p>week, the GSL issued a constructive statement re Iraq -- </p><p>see Ref B.)  It is possible that a GSL press statement </p><p>will be forthcoming, but contacts are not sure, given </p><p>that key ministers, including senior government </p><p>spokesman G.L. Peiris, are in Berlin for talks with the </p><p>Tamil Tigers.  Harim Peiris, a press spokesman for the </p><p>Office of President Kumaratunga, said he had "no </p><p>comment" on the speech at this time.  Mission also </p><p>contacted the Maldivian MFA in Male, which reported that </p><p>it had no plans to issue a statement right away.  Dr. </p><p>Shaheed, the MFA\'s Permanent Secretary, added that his </p><p>government was still reviewing the Secretary\'s comments. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) MEDIA REACTION:  There is no locally-generated </p><p>media reaction to share at this point.  Knowing that the </p><p>speech was scheduled, however, the English-language -- </p><p>although not the vernacular -- press saved a few front- </p><p>page inches for wire-feed (Reuters, etc.) coverage under </p><p>headlines such as "Powell plays UN tapes suggesting </p><p>Iraqi evasion" (ISLAND, opposition English daily) and </p><p>"Don\'t shrink from disarming Iraq:  Powell" (DAILY </p><p>MIRROR, independent English daily).  Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>substantive media reaction (editorials, op-ed pieces, </p><p>etc.) will probably not be available until the weekend. </p><p>Mission also did not notice any coverage of Secretary </p><p>Powell\'s speech in the official Maldivian government </p><p>website "Haveeru," nor in the anti-GoRM website, </p><p>"Sandhaanu." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) That said, Mission is doing everything that it </p><p>can to get the story out.  We are making tapes of the </p><p>speech available to Sri Lanka\'s government-owned and </p><p>independent TV channels for telecast prime time tonight </p><p>(2/6).  We are also turning Washington File materials -- </p><p>articles, visuals, etc. -- into press releases for </p><p>distribution to the media.  Additionally, we are sending </p><p>out a press release reviewing the highlights of the </p><p>speech and making its text widely available. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  As mentioned above, we expect that </p><p>media and other reaction to the speech will take several </p><p>days to roll in.  Per Ref B, the situation in the Gulf </p><p>region has been receiving increased press and public </p><p>attention in Sri Lanka of late.  There is some concern </p><p>bubbling up, for example, that a possible war could </p><p>cause oil shortages and a collapse in remittances from </p><p>overseas workers.  Despite the recent spurt in interest, </p><p>however, our assessment is that Sri Lankans seem </p><p>preoccupied with their very delicate peace process. </p><p>(Note:  The fifth round of GSL and Tamil Tiger talks is </p><p>taking place in Berlin, February 7-8.)  Given this </p><p>situation, Iraq does not appear destined to become a </p><p>major issue.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
