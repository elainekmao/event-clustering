<p>UNCLASSIFIED BUENOS AIRES 2481 </p><p> </p><p>Original Telegram was Confidential but has since been </p><p>de-classified </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Copy from the National Archives </p><p>RG 59: General Records of the Department of state </p><p>1964-66 Central Foreign Policy File </p><p>File: POL 33-4 ARG </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: DECLASSIFIED BY NARA 09/02/2009 </p><p>TAGS: EFIS, PBTS, AR </p><p>SUBJECT:  EXTENDED NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS OVER HIGH SEAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 106206 CIRCULAR; STATE CA-3400 NOV 2, 1966 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  PRESS REPORTS AND VARIETY EMBASSY SOURCES CONFIRM </p><p>NEW ARGENTINE LEGISLATION UNILATERALLY CHANGING SEAS JURIS- </p><p>DICTION NOW UNDER ADVANCED REVIEW.  REPORTEDLY LAW WOULD </p><p>ESTABLISH SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA, PLUS ANOTHER SIX MILES </p><p>OF EXCLUSIVE FISHING JURISDICTION, PLUS ANOTHER EXTENDED ZONE </p><p>OF "PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION" FOR FISHING PURPOSES.  DRAFT- </p><p>LAW UNDER CONSIDERATION IN ARGENTINE SENATE BEFORE JUNE 28 </p><p>COUP WOULD HAVE DEFINED ZONE OF PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION </p><p>AS "EPICONTINENTAL SEA OUT TO 200 METER ISOBAR".  IN SOUTHERN </p><p>ARGENTINA THIS ZONE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES WIDE AND BLANKETS </p><p>FALKLAND ISLANDS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  NAVATT STATES ARGENTINE NAVY THINKING OF PREFERENTIAL </p><p>JURISDICTION OUT TO 200 MILES (AS IN PERU, ECUADOR, CHILE) </p><p>RATHER THAN EPICONTINENTAL SEA.  200 MILE LIMIT DOES NOT </p><p>RPT NOT REACH FALKLANDS.  ARGENTINE NAVY OFF TOLD NAVATT </p><p>"200 MILE LIMIT SOON WILL BE STANDARD THROUGH HEMISPHERE". </p><p> </p><p>3.  FONOFF OFFICIALS REFERRING TO RECENT BRAZILIAN AND US </p><p>LEGISLATION HAVE INFORMALLY INDICATED DECISION ALREADY </p><p>FINAL RE SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA PLUS SIX MILE EXCLUSIVE </p><p>FISHING JURISDICTION, BUT THAT "PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION" </p><p>STILL UNDER STUDY.  TWO FONOFF MEN VOLUNTARILY AND INFORMALLY </p><p>SOUGHT EMBASSY REACTION TO POSSIBLE EXTENDED PREFERENTIAL </p><p>JURISDICTION BY SUGGESTING THAT US IN FACT HAS ACCEPTED </p><p>UNILATERALLY CREATED ECUADORIAN, PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN 200 MILE </p><p>LIMITS.  EMBOFF REJECTED IDEA US ACCEPTS THESE LIMITS IN ANY </p><p>WAY AND POINTED OUT 1965 AMENDMENTS TO AID LEGISLATION AIMED </p><p>AT FURTHER PROTECTING US FISHING RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  FONOFF LEGAL ADVISOR CONCEDES DISTINCTION BETWEEN </p><p>"EXCLUSIVE" AND "PREFERENTIAL" FISHING JURISDICTION A SEMANTIC </p><p>NICETY.  HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IN ZONE OF "PREFERENTIAL" JURIS- </p><p>DICTION ARGENTINA WOULD CLAIM RIGHT TO TAX, LICENSE AND OTHER- </p><p>WISE CONTROL ALL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EXPLOITATION OF </p><p>RESOURCES OF SEA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DRAFT LEGISLATION ON SEAS JURISDICTION LAY DORMANT UNTIL </p><p>SUDDEN AND SUBSTANTIAL IN FISHIN ARGENTINE EPICONTINENTAL SEAS </p><p>BY CUBAN AND EAST EUROPEAN (ESPECIALLY SOVIET) VESSELS PAST </p><p>SIX MONTHS ALARMED ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES.  (SEE NAVATT IR </p><p>5-804-0-140-66 OF NOV 18) NOT RPT NOT ALL SOVIET VESSELS WERE </p><p>FISHING OR FACTORY TYPES.  FONOFF SOURCES INFORMALLY STATE </p><p>ARMED FORCES PRESSURE MAKES EMISSION NEW LAW IMPERATIVE, QUITE </p><p>POSSIBLY APPEARING WITHIN NEXT FEW WEEKS.  WHEN ASKED BY FONOFF </p><p>MEN ABOUT "SECURITY PROBLEMS CREATED BY SOVIET TRAWLERS OFF US </p><p>COAST", EMBASSY OFF REPLIED US DID NOT RPT NOT SEE THAT </p><p>UNILATERAL ATTEMPT TO EXTEND SEAS JURISDICTION OFFERED ANY </p><p>REALISTIC SOLUTION FOR POSSIBLE SECURITY PROBLEMS, WHILE SUCH </p><p>ACTION COULD CREATE NEW SOURCES POSSIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING AND </p><p>CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  RE PAR 3 STATE 106206 BELIEVE OUTLINED PROPOSAL MIGHT </p><p>FORESTALL UNILATERAL ARGENTINE ATTEMPT TO SUBSTANTIALLY EXTEND </p><p>"PREFERENTIAL" FISHING JURISDICTION ONLY IF EMBASSY CAN BE </p><p>AUTHORIZED DISCUSS IDEA WITH ARGENTINES IMMEDIATELY. EVEN THEN </p><p>CHANCES SUCCESS LIMITED BY (A) ADVANCED STAGE PROPOSED ARGENTINE </p><p>LAW AND (B) PRIMACY SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ARGENTINE THINKING. </p><p>WE WOULD BENEFIT SOME FROM FONOFF LEGAL ADVISORS\' QUALMS ABOUT </p><p>UNILATERAL ACTION, AND FROM RESTRAINT OF RECENT BRAZILIAN </p><p>LEGISLATION WHICH DID NOT RPT NOT GO BEYOND 12-MILE LIMIT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  FOR DISCUSSION WITH ARGENTINES WOULD MODIFY TEXT IN STATE </p><p>10942 CIRCULAR TO:  (A) MAKE ALL REFERENCES TO ARGENTINA, VICE </p><p>CANADA; (B) REFER TO PROPOSED ARGENTINE CLAIMS OF PREFERENTIAL </p><p>JURISDICTION OVER WATERS WE REGARD AS HIGH SEAS; (C) ELIMINATE </p><p>REFERENCES TO "TRADITIONAL DISTANT WATER FISHERIES", SINCE </p><p>ARGENTINE COAST NOT RPT NOT TRADITIONAL FISHING ZONE (WHEREAS </p><p>NO. 3);  (D) ADD NOTATION THERE NO TRADITIONAL FISHING AND </p><p>CONFINE OPERATIVE AGREEMENT TO PROVISIONS FOR NON-TRADITIONAL </p><p>FISHING; (E) ELIMINATE LAST THREE PARS OF AIDE-MEMOIRE HANDED </p><p>TO CANADIAN AMB. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IF AUTHORIZED, ENVISAGE TWO-STEP APPROACH TO FONOFF. </p><p>FIRST, INFORMAL AND ORAL, STRESSING OUR INTEREST IN FREEDOM OF </p><p>HIGH SEAS, NOTING EARLIER FONOFF CONFIRMATION NEW LAW UNDER </p><p>STUDY, OUTLINING OUR PROPOSAL IN GENERAL TERMS.  ON BASIS </p><p>FONOFF REACTION, WE WOULD THEN COUCH AIDE-MEMOIRE IN TERMS </p><p>WHICH WOULD APPEAR MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED. </p><p> </p><p>GP-3 </p><p>SACCIO </p><p></p></div>
