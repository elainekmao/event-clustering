(C) SUMMARY:  On July 28 Honduran authorities seized </p><p>approximately 525 kilos of cocaine from a Colombian go-fast </p><p>boat that was forced to beach near the remote northern </p><p>coastal region of Limon, Colon.  The vessel was first </p><p>interdicted by the Honduran Navy at approximately 17:45, some </p><p>nine nautical miles off the Honduran coast.  Preliminary </p><p>reports indicate that as the Colombian vessel attempted to </p><p>escape, crew members opened fire on the Honduran Navy. </p><p>Honduran Navy personnel returned fire, apparently mortally </p><p>wounding one Honduran crew member.  The Honduran Navy pursued </p><p>the vessel to the shore where they were able to arrest two </p><p>other Colombian crew members while two other unidentified </p><p>individuals escaped.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) On July 28 Honduran authorities seized approximately </p><p>525 kilos of cocaine from a Colombian go-fast boat that was </p><p>forced to beach near the remote northern coastal region of </p><p>Limon, Colon.  The vessel originally departed Colombia\'s </p><p>Caribbean coast on July 27 and was tracked to Honduras by USG </p><p>assets.  On July 28 JIATF-S provided TAT Honduras information </p><p>regarding the location of the vessel; TAT Honduras then </p><p>relayed the information to Honduran authorities. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Government of Honduras (GOH) authorities then deployed </p><p>all of their navy assets from Puerto Castilla, Colon in an </p><p>effort to interdict the vessel.  A Honduran Navy patrol boat </p><p>made contact with the vessel at approximately 17:45, some </p><p>nine nautical miles off the coast, at which point it </p><p>apparently instructed the intruding go-fast to surrender for </p><p>boarding.  In an effort to escape, the vessel\'s crew then </p><p>reportedly opened fire on the Honduran patrol boat.  Honduran </p><p>Navy personal returned fire and pursued the go-fast, </p><p>eventually forcing the vessel to beach. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The go-fast reportedly had a crew of five.  Of those: </p><p>one was mortally wounded in the fire-fight; two were brought </p><p>into custody; and two unidentified individuals escaped after </p><p>the vessel beached.  Initial reports named the deceased as </p><p>Tito Montes, a Honduran national and possible brother or son </p><p>of well-known Honduran drug trafficker Carlos Montes who was </p><p>recently released from a Honduran jail.  The two other </p><p>individuals taken into custody were Manuel Salvador Guzman </p><p>Miranda and Blas Guzman Miranda, both Colombian nationals. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) TAT Honduras reports that this particular load was </p><p>possibly owned by Rodrigo Cadena, a high-ranking AUC </p><p>Colombian paramilitary officer.  Apparently when the vessel </p><p>departed Colombia it was believed to be carrying </p><p>approximately 1,600 kilos of cocaine.  It is thought that the </p><p>missing kilos may have already been off-loaded (in a possible </p><p>drugs-for-arms deal) before the go-fast returned to sea for </p><p>refueling. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) This latest seizure brings the total amount of cocaine </p><p>seized this year in Honduras to approximately 4,500 kilos. </p><p>This is more than double what has been seized in the last </p><p>three years combined. </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
