<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000394 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, PTER, BG, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BANGLADESH PRIME MINISTER LOOKS EASTWARD, </p><p>DISCOVERS BURMA </p><p> </p><p>REF: HANOI 694 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Summary: Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia\'s </p><p>three day visit to Burma produced understandings on trade, </p><p>transport connections, and refugees.  Terrorism was not </p><p>discussed, but, according to the Bangladeshi Defense Attache, </p><p>Bangladesh has continued with efforts to clean up its side of </p><p>the border. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The visit of Bangladesh\'s Prime Minister Khaleda Zia </p><p>went very well, according to Bangladesh\'s Defense Attache, </p><p>Brigadier Salim Akhtar.  The visit was meant to reciprocate </p><p>Than Shwe\'s December 2002 visit to Bangladesh and underline </p><p>Bangladesh\'s new interest in relations with Burma and the </p><p>other states of Southeast Asia.  Begum Zia met with Than Shwe </p><p>for about 90 minutes on March 20 and agreed on a number of </p><p>key points, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- A Road Connection between Dhaka and Rangoon:  According to </p><p>Brigadier Salim this will involve construction of a small </p><p>bridge upstream on the Naaf River and a short stretch of road </p><p>in Burma\'s Rakhine State.  If all goes well, construction on </p><p>the bridge and road will start this year. </p><p> </p><p>-- Coastal Shipping: An MOU signed on March 20 will allow </p><p>direct service between Chittagong and Rangoon.  Until now, </p><p>cargoes between the two states were shipped via Singapore, </p><p> </p><p>-- Trade: A second MOU established a joint trade commission </p><p>and a bilateral trading account.  Both arrangements are </p><p>intended to facilitate trade. </p><p> </p><p>-- Refugees: Essentially, the two sides agreed to let the </p><p>Rohingya Muslim refugee issue die.  Burma recommitted itself </p><p>to accepting back all refugees who could establish their </p><p>credentials as genuine residents of Burma; Bangladesh made no </p><p>commitments, but implicitly agreed to accomodate any refugees </p><p>who could not or would not return to Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Burmese Business Community Bullish on Bangladesh </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to members of the Union of Myanmar Chamber </p><p>of Commerce and Industry (UMCCI), the trade fair that </p><p>accompanied PM Zia\'s visit may lead to better ties.  Burma\'s </p><p>exports to Bangladesh now largely consist of smuggled goods </p><p>(mostly rice) or transhipped consumer products from China. </p><p>While the business leaders don\'t believe improved trade ties </p><p>will end smuggling, they do hope for some increase in legal </p><p>trade (e.g.; agricultural and wood products from Burma in </p><p>return for pharmaceuticals and cement from Bangladesh). </p><p> </p><p>False Rumors </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Salim, the two sides did not discuss any </p><p>plans for energy cooperation.  U.S. companies in Bangladesh </p><p>(meaning UNOCAL) had attempted to promote a pipeline from a </p><p>prospective gas field off Burma\'s Rakhine State to Bangladesh </p><p>and then onwards to India, but there has been no official </p><p>backing for the proposal from either Burma or Bangldesh. </p><p>Similarly, according to Salim and the UMCCI representatives, </p><p>news stories of Burmese plans to lease rice cultivation land </p><p>to Bangladeshi entrepreneurs appeared to reflect only the </p><p>musings of Bangladeshi private sector interests.  There had </p><p>been no discussion at all of that possibility during the </p><p>official talks. </p><p> </p><p>Terrorism </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Salim also said that the two sides did not get into </p><p>any serious discussion of terrorism along their common </p><p>border.  However, he said that the Burmese were aware of </p><p>Bangladeshi efforts to clean up the area.  Salim said that </p><p>the Bangladeshi Army had run sweeps through the area in June </p><p>2002, December 2002, and February 2003.  The target was </p><p>gun-running by the Rohingya Solidarity Organization (RSO), </p><p>which he said was funneling arms from Thailand to criminal </p><p>gangs in Bangladesh.  Salim noted that the RSO had only 150 </p><p>to 200 men under arms and were more a nuisance than a serious </p><p>threat to anyone.  Nevertheless, the BDG was determined to </p><p>deal with the problem and to bring it to an end by June 2003, </p><p>if possible. </p><p>Strategy </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Salim said that this new openness in relations with </p><p>Burma was part of Bangladesh\'s own "Look Eastward" policy. </p><p>Just as India had reopened relations with Burma out of an </p><p>early 1990s fear of encirclement by China and its allies, so </p><p>Bangladesh has taken the same step out of a similar fear of </p><p>encirclement by India and its allies.  According to Salim, </p><p>there was also the lure of trade with Southeast Asia.  For </p><p>too long, he said, Bangladesh had focussed its foreign policy </p><p>on India, China, and the West, without ever considering the </p><p>opportunities in Southeast Asia.  This visit, together with </p><p>the exchange of visits between Begum Zia and Thailand\'s Prime </p><p>Minister Thaksin in December 2002, were steps towards a </p><p>broader and more balanced set of relations for Bangladesh. </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Bangladesh is the latest of the regional states to </p><p>discover Burma.  Like China, India, and Thailand before it, </p><p>Bangladesh has evidently come to the conclusion that there is </p><p>more to be gained from dealing with Burma than from shunning </p><p>it.  From the Burmese side, there\'s no arguing that the SPDC, </p><p>increasingly isolated politically by the West, is having </p><p>signficant diplomatic success in improving its economic and </p><p>political relations with neighbors and ASEAN partners.  The </p><p>visit of Prime Minister Zia, on the heels of a trip by Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe to Vietnam, demonstrates that this </p><p>diplomatic campaign, at first focused on the major players </p><p>(India, China, and Thailand), is now expanding to countries </p><p>with which Burma has not had historically strong ties.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) This cable has been cleared with Embassy Dhaka. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
