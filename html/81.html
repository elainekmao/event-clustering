<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ALEXANDRIA 00547 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/IL AND NEA/RA - HOLLY </p><p>DEPT PLS PASS DEPT OF LABOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, ELAB, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  MORE ON LABOR STRIKE IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ALEXANDRIA 524 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SINCE SUBMISSION OF REFTEL, ANOTHER LOCAL SECURITY </p><p>OFFICIAL HAS CONFIRMED TO US THAT A LABOR STRIKE OCCURRED </p><p>IN MID-JUNE AT THE NEARBY ABU KIR ENGINEERING INDUSTRIES </p><p>FACTORY, RESULTING IN AUTHORITIES\' CLOSING IT FOR TWO </p><p>DAYS--JUNE 19-20.  THE OFFICIAL CONFIRMED THAT POLICE </p><p>INTERVENED TO BREAK UP THE STRIKE, BUT LIKE THE SECURITY </p><p>CONTACT CITED IN REFTEL, SAID HE KNEW NOTHING OF ARRESTS </p><p>OR INJURIES.  INTERESTINGLY, THE LATTER SOURCE INDICATED </p><p>THAT CONTRARY TO OUR UNDERSTANDING, THE ABU KIR FACTORY </p><p>IS RUN BY THE MILITARY, ALTHOUGH THE WORKERS ARE </p><p>CIVILIAN.  WHILE DENYING THE OCCURRENCE OF A SECOND </p><p>STRIKE, AT THE MOHARREM BEY DEFENSE PLANT, HE DID SAY </p><p>THAT, AS PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, FOLLOWING THE ABU KIR </p><p>INCIDENT, SECURITY POLICE WERE DEPLOYED AROUND THE </p><p>MOHARREM BEY FACILITY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN ADDITION TO THE NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE UNIONIST </p><p>GROUPING PARTY\'S WEEKLY, AL-AHALI, ANOTHER OPPOSITION </p><p>JOURNAL, THE SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY\'S ASH-SHAAB, ALSO </p><p>REPORTED ON ALEXANDRIA\'S LABOR TROUBLE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>ASH-SHAAB, IT WAS AT THE INSTRUCTION OF THE GOE\'S </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE FOR MILITARY PRODUCTION, GAMAL IBRAHIM, </p><p>THAT THE ABU KIR PLANT WAS CLOSED FOR TWO DAYS, IN </p><p>REACTION TO THE STRIKE OVER NON-PAYMENT OF WORKERS\' </p><p>BONUSES. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  WITH OUR SECURITY SOURCES REPORTING THAT ALL IS NOW </p><p>BACK TO NORMAL AT THE ABU KIR FACTORY, THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PRESS ALSO SEEMS TO CONSIDER THE MATTER CLOSED:  NEITHER </p><p>ASH-SHAAB NOR AL-AHALI CONTAINED A FOLLOW-UP STORY ON </p><p>THE INCIDENT IN THEIR LATEST EDITIONS, JUNE 25 AND 26, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  THE INCIDENT AT THE ABU KIR FACTORY SEEMS </p><p>TO FIT THE PATTERN OF THE FEW LABOR STRIKES THAT OCCUR </p><p>IN EGYPT:  A BRIEF FLARE-UP OF WORKER UNREST, CONFINED </p><p>TO A SPECIFIC FACTORY, AND FOCUSED ON BREAD-AND-BUTTER </p><p>ISSUES.  WHAT IS NOT TYPICAL ABOUT THIS STRIKE IS THAT </p><p>IT APPARENTLY INVOLVED THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY, WHICH WOULD </p><p>ACCOUNT FOR THE B BWPID RESPONSE BY THE AUTHORITIES--AT </p><p>BOTH THE ABU KIR AND MOHARREM BEY SITES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COOK </p><p></p></div>
