<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002243 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI, Media and Communications </p><p>SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS CHALLENGE MEDIA </p><p>CONTROL LAW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Journalists working for the privately owned media </p><p>      in Zimbabwe have filed an urgent application with the </p><p>      Supreme Court of Zimbabwe to challenge certain </p><p>      sections of the controversial Access to Information </p><p>      and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA).  Lawyers </p><p>      representing the Independent Journalists Association </p><p>      of Zimbabwe (IJAZ) describe the Act as a "sudden leap </p><p>      into autocracy."  The legal challenge focuses on those </p><p>      sections of the Act that require journalists to </p><p>      register with the government, and that prescribe </p><p>      penalties (up to two years in prison) for "abuse of </p><p>      journalistic privilege" and "publishing falsehoods." </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under AIPPA, all journalists and privately owned </p><p>      media organizations are required to register with the </p><p>      government by October 31, 2002.  State-owned media </p><p>      organizations are exempted from this requirement. </p><p>      Consensus among the independent media is that the </p><p>      organizations will register, but individual </p><p>      journalists will not.  This opens the possibility that </p><p>      journalists working for the privately owned media </p><p>      could be arrested on November 1.  The legal challenge </p><p>      brought by IJAZ is partially intended to relieve that </p><p>      threat. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
