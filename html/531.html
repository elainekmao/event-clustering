<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 BOGOTA 10667 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y (TEXT THROUGHOUT) </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KPRP. PINR, PINS, PGOV, CO </p><p>SUBJECT:  "SNOW WHITE AND THE FOUR DWARFS" -- BIOS OF </p><p>FARC\'S 5-MAN SECRETARIAT </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE HIGHEST DECISION-MAKING BODY OF THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC), COLOMBIA\'S </p><p>OLDEST AND LARGEST GUERRILLA GROUP, IS ITS FIVE-MEMBER </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARIAT, COMPOSED SINCE AUGUST 1990 OF </p><p>LEGENDARY FARC HEAD MANUEL MARULANDA VELEZ ("TIROFIJO"), </p><p>POLITICAL CHIEF ALFONSO CANO, RAUL REYES, TIMOLEON JIMENEZ </p><p>AND IVAN MARQUEZ.  THE FIVE COME FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, </p><p>AND THE FARC\'S HISTORICAL DISTINCTIONS -- CAMPESINOS VS. </p><p>INTELLECTUALS, OLDTIMERS VS. NEWCOMERS -- ARE EVIDENT </p><p>AMONG THEM.  THE SECRETARIAT, WHICH HAS BEEN REFERRED TO </p><p>AS "SNOW WHITE AND THE FOUR DWARFS" TO ILLUSTRATE THE </p><p>DIFFERENCE IN STATURE BETWEEN MARULANDA AND THE REST, CAN </p><p>ALSO BE CHARACTERIZED AS FOUR HARDLINERS VS. ONE MODERATE, </p><p>CANO.  A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE FARC IS THAT THERE </p><p>APPEARS TO BE NO ONE CAPABLE OF REPLACING MARULANDA, THE </p><p>GLUE THAT HOLDS THE FARC TOGETHER.  THIS CABLE PROVIDES </p><p>BIOGRAPHIES OF THE FIVE FARC SECRETARIAT MEMBERS, AND </p><p>FULFILLS THE POST REPORTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS FOR BIOS ON </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT (JUNE) AND MARULANDA (AUGUST).  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  POLOFF GLEANED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FROM MANY </p><p>CONVERSATIONS OVER THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR WITH SEVERAL </p><p>CONTACTS, INCLUDING, FIRST AND FOREMOST, COLOMBIAN </p><p>BUSINESSMAN MORITZ AKERMAN.  AKERMAN IS AN EX-COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY ACTIVIST WHO IS CLOSE TO ALFONSO CANO AND KNOWS IVAN </p><p>MARQUEZ.  INFORMATION WAS ALSO DERIVED FROM CANO\'S </p><p>BROTHER, ROBERTO SAENZ (HIMSELF A COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST </p><p>UNTIL NOVEMBER 1991); CARLOS EDUARDO JARAMILLO, A GOC </p><p>PEACE NEGOTIATOR FOR FIVE YEARS WHO KNOWS CANO AND MARQUEZ </p><p>WELL AND HAS MET MARULANDA AND THE REST AT THE FARC\'S </p><p>FORMER CASA VERDE SANCTUARY; ACADEMIC GUERRILLA EXPERT </p><p>EDUARDO PIZARRO, EX-COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST AND BROTHER </p><p>OF ASSASSINATED M-19 HEAD CARLOS PIZARRO, AND OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BECAUSE OF THEIR WORK AS GUERRILLA PEACE NEGOTIATORS </p><p>FRON, JUNE 1991-JUNE 1992, CANO AND MARQUEZ ARE WELL-KNOWN </p><p>OUTSIDE OF THE FARC.  CANO IS BY FAR THE BEST-KNOWN </p><p>SECRETARIAT MEMBER IN BOGOTA, DESPITE HIS DOZEN YEARS IN </p><p>CLANDESTINITY.  AKERMAN, PIZARRO AND JARAMILLO WERE </p><p>NATIONAL UNIVERSITY CLASSMATES OF CANO\'S.  MARULANDA, A </p><p>LIVING LEGEND, OBVIOUSLY IS WELL-KNOWN.  RAUL REYES IS </p><p>KNOWN IN BOGOTA BECAUSE OF HIS LINKS TO THE PARTY\'S </p><p>HIERARCHY.  THE LEAST KNOWN BY FAR (AT LEAST IN THE </p><p>CAPITAL) IS TIMOLEON JIMENEZ, A CAMPESINO WHO GREW UP IN </p><p>THE INSURGENCY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MANUEL MARULANDA:  MORE CAMPESINO THAN COMMUNIST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>5.  THE FARC HAS BEEN CALLED AN ARMY OF SEVERAL COLONELS </p><p>BUT ONLY ONE GENERAL;  MANUEL MARULANDA VELEZ IS THAT </p><p>GENERAL.  AT 64, MARULANDA IS LATIN AMERICA\'S OLDEST AND </p><p>MOST EXPERIENCED GUERRILLA LEADER.  HE\'S BEEN AN INSURGENT </p><p>FOR 43 YEARS, SINCE BEFORE CASTRO\'S REVOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN 1949, DURING COLOMBIA\'S LIBERAL/CONSERVATIVE CIVIL </p><p>WAR, KNOWN AS "LA VIOLENCIA," MARULANDA (REAL NAME PEDRO </p><p>ANTONIO MARIN), JOINED THE LIBERAL GUERRILLA OPPOSITION TO </p><p>THE CONSERVATIVE DICTATORSHIP.  WHILE MARULANDA BEGAN AS A </p><p>LIBERAL GUERRILLA, BY THE TIME LA VIOLENCIA HAD ENDED HE </p><p>HAD BECOME A COMMUNIST REBEL LEADER.  LIKE MANY OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST INSURGENCY\'S EARLY LEADERS, MARULANDA HAILS FROM </p><p>AND BEGAN HIS GUERRILLA CAREER IN TOLIMA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE NOM DE GUERRE MANUEL MARULANDA VELEZ WAS ADOPTED </p><p>FROM THE COMMUNIST LABOR LEADER OF THE SAME NAME, A </p><p>PARTICIPANT IN THE VIOLENT 1925 LABOR STRIFE AND LATER A </p><p>FOUNDER OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCC).  THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES GAVE MARULANDA (MARIN) THE </p><p>NICKNAME "TIROFIJO" (SURE SHOT), WHICH HAS STUCK.  INSIDE </p><p>THE INSURGENCY, HOWEVER, WHERE IT\'S CONSIDERED SOMEWHAT </p><p>PEJORATIVE, NO ONE CALLS HIM THAT; HE\'S "COMANDANTE </p><p>MARULANDA" TO HIS FARC UNDERLINGS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THERE ARE MANY SIDES TO MARULANDA.  HE\'S A CAMPESINO, </p><p>GUERRILLA, COMMUNIST, SOLDIER, POLITICIAN, ALL ROLED INTO </p><p>ONE.  HE IS, HOWEVER, A CAMPESINO LEADER FIRST, A </p><p>COMMUNIST SECOND; MORE ZAPATA OR PANCHO VILLA THAN LENIN </p><p>OR STALIN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT SINCE LEADING HIS </p><p>OWN "GREAT MARCH" OF HUNDREDS OF FOLLOWERS AFTER THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES\' EXPLUSION OF THE FARC FROM ITS CASA VERDE </p><p>SANCTUARY IN DECEMBER 1990 (FOUR MONTHS AFTER BECOMING FARC </p><p>HEAD) MARULANDA HAS BEEN FEELING MESSIANIC AND SOMEWHAT </p><p>LIKE MAO, WHOSE 1949 REVOLUTION STRONGLY INFLUENCED THE </p><p>PCC AND FARC. </p><p> </p><p>10.  AN UNEDUCATED CAMPESINO, MARULANDA IS RESPECTED BOTH </p><p>INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE INSURGENCY FOR HIS MILITARY SKILLS, </p><p>BUT HAS NEVER PROFESSED TO HAVE POLITICAL SAVVY.  NOR DOES </p><p>HE HAVE POLITICAL AMBITIONS; HE HAS NO INTEREST IN A </p><p>POST-INSURGENCY POLITICAL CAREER. </p><p> </p><p>11.  MARULANDA HAS NEITHER A GRAND VISION FOR COLOMBIA, </p><p>NOR A SPECIFIC POLITICAL AGENDA.  HE DOESN\'T KNOW </p><p>PRECISELY WHAT HE\'S FIGHTING FOR.  HIS MOTIVATION IS THE </p><p>WELFARE OF "HIS PEOPLE," I.E., CAMPESINOS.  WHILE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TALKS ABOUT ENDING THE INSURGENCY, MARULANDA\'S </p><p>CONCERN IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO CAMPESINOS IF THEIR </p><p>SELF-DEFENSE ARMY (THE FARC) DISAPPEARS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  OTHER THAN HIS ADOPTED COMMUNISM, MARULANDA HAS NO </p><p>FIRM POLITICAL BELIEFS.  HE USUALLY SIDES WITH FARC/PCC </p><p>HARDLINERS, BUT A MORE PROMINENT FEATURE OF HIS </p><p>PERSONALITY APPEARS TO BE HIS MALLEABILITY; MARULANDA IS </p><p>OPEN TO PERSUASION.  HE VARYINGLY HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE </p><p>A HARDLINER AND TO HAVE BEEN WON OVER TO HIS POLITICAL </p><p>CHIEF ALFONSO CANO\'S PRO-NEGOTIATED-PEACE POSITION.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, HE HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE MORE UNDER THE </p><p>INFLUENCE OF BOTH THE PCC AUD THE ELN THAN HIS </p><p>PREDECESSOR, JACOBO ARENAS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  INDEED, ONE CRITICISM OF MARULANDA IS THAT HE HAS </p><p>PRESIDED OVER THE "ELENIZATION" OF THE FARC, I.E., THAT </p><p>UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP (BEGINNING WITH THE DEATH OF JACOBO </p><p>ARENAS IN AUGUST 1990) THE FARC HAS ADOPTED MANY OF THE </p><p>ELN\'S MILITARY TACTICS (E.G., ECONOMIC TERRORISM) WHILE </p><p>MARULANDA HIMSELF HAS FALLEN INCREASING UNDER ELN HEAD </p><p>MANUEL PEREZ\' IDEOLOGICAL/POLITICAL INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  ONE PERSON\'S ADVICE MARULANDA NEVER HAS SOUGHT IS </p><p>FIDEL CASTRO\'S.  MARULANDA NEVER HAS HAD VERY CLOSE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE CUBAN LEADER, WHOM MARULANDA PREDATES </p><p>AS A GUERRILLA AND NEVER HAS FIGURED HE HAD MUCH TO LEARN </p><p>FROM.  MARULANDA HAS TURNED DOWN SEVERAL INVITATIONS TO </p><p>VISIT CUBA.  ONE RESULT IS THAT, TYPICAL OF FARC MILITARY </p><p>LEADERS, MARULANDA HAS NO FORMAL MILITARY TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>15.  VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE TALKED ABOUT MARULANDA\'S </p><p>ISOLATION IN THE JUNGLE; HE IS SAID TO BE OUT OF TOUCH </p><p>WITH REALITY.  MARULANDA RECEIVES VERY LITTLE INFORMATION </p><p>FROM THE WORLD OUTSIDE HIS JUNGLE RETREATS OTHER THAN THAT </p><p>EDITED BY HIS PCC VISITORS.  CANO IS SAID TO BE UNABLE TO </p><p>COMMUNICATE TO HIM WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE </p><p>HIS JUNGLE HAUNTS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  MARULANDA LAST VISITED A CITY, NEIVA IN HUILA </p><p>DEPARTMENT (1985 POP. 178,000; HARDLY A METROPOLIS), IN </p><p>1963.  HE REPORTEDLY NEVER HAS FLOWN ON AN AIRPLANE, NEVER </p><p>LEFT COLOMBIA.  ONE REASON HE REFUSES TO COME DOWN FROM </p><p>THE MOUNTAINS IS HIS PARANOID FEAR FOR HIS LIFE.  HE IS </p><p>SAID TO FULLY TRUST NO ONE.  THE PERSONS HE TRUSTS MOST </p><p>ARE THOSE FEW FELLOW FARC GUERRILLAS WITH HIM SINCE THE </p><p>EARLY YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  FARC CONFIDANT MORITZ AKERMAN RELATED THE STORY OF </p><p>HOW MARULANDA ONCE RECEIVED A GIFT BOTTLE OF WHISKEY (HIS </p><p>FAVORITE DRINK) FROM CASTRO.  FEARING BEING POISONED, </p><p>TIROFIJO REFUSED TO DRINK IT, INSISTING ON THE BOTTLE </p><p>BEING BROKEN IN FRONT OF HIM.  TIROFIJO ALSO, ACCORDING TO </p><p>AKERMAN, REFUSED TO TAKE PILLS CANO BROUGHT BACK FOR HIM </p><p>FROM HIS NOVEMBER 1991 VISIT TO CUBA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALFONSO CANO:  CITY-SMART BOY STUCK IN A CAMPESINO ARMY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>18.  THE FARC\'S SECRETARIAT CAN BE VIEWED IN GENERAL AS </p><p>FOUR PRO-ARMED STRUGGLE HARDLINERS AGAINST ONE </p><p>PRO-NEGOTIATED PEACE MODERATE, ALFONSO CANO.  GUILLERMO </p><p>LEON SAENZ VARGAS (ALIAS ALFONSO CANO) IS THE SECOND IN </p><p>COMMAND AND THE FARC\'S IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL LEADER. </p><p>CANO, MID-40S, IS FROM BOGOTA, WHERE HE STUDIED </p><p>ANTHROPOLOGY AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, WHERE THE BEST </p><p>BRAINS IN A GENERATION OF COLOMBIAN LEFTISTS WERE </p><p>GATHERED.  AT THE TIME, SAENZ (THE NON DE GUERRE WAS </p><p>ADOPTED WHEN HE JOINED THE INSURGENCY) WAS ACTIVE IN THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY\'S YOUTH MOVEMENT, JUCO.  IN THE </p><p>EARLY 1980S, JUST BEFORE COMPLETING HIS STUDIES, CANO LEFT </p><p>TO JOIN THE FARC\'S RURAL INSURGENCY. </p><p> </p><p>19.  CANO HAS NEVER COMMANDED A FRONT; INDEED, HE HAS NO </p><p>MILITARY EXPERIENCE.  FROM DAY ONE, HIS JOB HAS BEEN TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE CAMPESINO ARMY WITH POLITICAL LEADERSHIP.  HE </p><p>REPORTEDLY WAS CLOSE TO FARC HEAD JACOBO ARENAS UNTIL HIS </p><p>AUGUST 1990 HEART-ATTACK DEATH, AT WHICH TIME CANO </p><p>REPLACED ARENAS AS THE FARC\'S POLITICAL/IDEOLOGICAL CHIEF. </p><p> </p><p>20.  CANO WAS THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST OF A CROP OF JUCO </p><p>ACTIVISTS THE PARTY SENT TO THE FARC IN THE EARLY 1980S </p><p>OSTENSIBLY TO PROVIDE THE GUERRILLA GROUP WITH POLITICAL </p><p>ADVICE, BUT ACTUALLY TO MAINTAIN THE PARTY\'S INFLUENCE </p><p>OVER THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING INSURGENCY. </p><p> </p><p>21.  ARENAS\' DEATH LEFT CANO FAR AND AWAY THE MOST </p><p>INTELLECTUALLY CAPABLE GUERRILLA LEADER, FARC OR ELN. </p><p>THAT SUPERIOR INTELLECT, HOWEVER, COMBINED WITH HIS LACK </p><p>OF MILITARY SKILLS AND THE FACT THAT HE IS AN EDUCATED </p><p>"CITY BOY" IN A CAMPESINO ARMY, HAS STEERED HIM TOWARD </p><p>BECOMING A SPOKESMAN/NEGOTIATOR/DIPLOMAT FOR THE </p><p>INSURGENCY, RATHER THAN A LEADER OF IT.  (FOR EXAMPLE, A </p><p>PROBLEM FOR THE PEACE TALKS IS THAT CANO HAS LACKED </p><p>DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY.) </p><p> </p><p>22.  SEVERAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED CANO TO BE THE </p><p>CONSUMATE DIPLOMAT, NEVER LOSING CONTROL OF HIMSELF OR </p><p>HIS TEMPER, ALWAYS CHOOSING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY.  THAT\'S </p><p>EVIDENT IN BROADCAST INTERVIEWS.  CARLOS EDUARDO </p><p>JARAMILLO, WHO AS A GOC NEGOTIATOR SAT ACROSS THE TABLE </p><p>FROM CANO FROM JUNE-NOVEMBER 1991 IN CARACAS, CREDITED </p><p>CANO WITH KEEPING THE NEGOTIATING SESSIONS MOVING </p><p>FORWARD.  BY CONTRAST, JARAMILLO CHARACTERIZED THE OTHER </p><p>CGSB NEGOTIATORS, INCLUDING IVAN MARQUEZ, AS "MILITARY </p><p>TYPES" WHO WOULD STATE THEIR POSITION, THEN REFUSE TO </p><p>BUDGE.  HE CREDITED CANO WITH ALWAYS MANEUVERING TO AVOID </p><p>OR RESOLVE QUARRELS. </p><p></p><p>23.  EVERYONE AGREES CANO IS THE CGSB\'S MOST ACTIVE </p><p>CATALYST FOR A NEGOTIATED END TO THE INSURGENCY.  CANO </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THAT THE INSURGENCY IS DEFEATED POLITICALLY, </p><p>IF NOT YET MILITARILY.  HE KNOWS THE ARMED STRUGGLE HAS NO </p><p>FUTURE, NOR HE IN IT.  CANO ALSO MAY BE EXPERIENCING A </p><p>"MID-LIFE CRISIS," DREADING SPENDING THE REST OF HIS LIFE </p><p>AS A GUERRILLA, AS DID ARENAS.  HE WOULD LIKE TO DO </p><p>SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE IT\'S TOO LATE.  AS AKERMAN ONCE TOLD </p><p>POLOFF, "CANO WOULD RATHER BE NO. 50 IN SOMETHING THAT HAS </p><p>A FUTURE THAN NO. 2 IN A DEAD-END VENTURE."  CANO WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO TRY HIS HAND AT POLITICS, BUT IS TRAPPED IN THE </p><p>INSURGENCY.  HE REALIZES THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT </p><p>ALIVE IS TO BRING THE REST OF THE FARC WITH HIM, I.E., TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE AN END TO THEIR ARMED STRUGGLE.  BECAUSE HE IS </p><p>THE INSURGENCY\'S MOST PRO-PEACE LEADER, THE GOC WOULD </p><p>PREFER TO DEAL WITH CANO THAN ANY OTHER GUERRILLA. </p><p> </p><p>24.  CANO HAS HIS FOLLOWERS IN THE FARC, AND IF HE LEFT </p><p>THE INSURGENCY, POSSIBLY COULD TAKE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION </p><p>(ESTIMATES VARY FROM 30-70 PERCENT) OF THE GUERRILLA GROUP </p><p>WITH HIM.  CANO, HOWEVER, PREFERS TO STRUGGLE FROM WITHIN </p><p>TO DRAG TIROFIJO AND THE ENTIRE FARC INTO A PEACE </p><p>AGREEMENT.  THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE.  IN TAKING THE SLOW, </p><p>INTEGRAL APPROACH, CANO RISKS LOSING THE GOVERNMENT ALONG </p><p>THE WAY (AS THE RECENT GOC TURN TOWARD A MORE MILITARISTIC </p><p>APPROACH HAS SHOWN).  AKERMAN HAS COUNSELED CANO THAT "HE </p><p>HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN 30,000 INSURGENTS/SYMPATHIZERS AND </p><p>30 MILLION COLOMBIANS." </p><p> </p><p>25.  CANO\'S PERSISTENCE IN PUSHING A NEGOTIATED END TO THE </p><p>INSURGENCY HAS EARNED HIM THE WRATH OF HIS HARDLINE </p><p>COMRADES IN BOTH THE FARC AND THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY (PCC).  THE PARTY IS NO MORE MONOLITHIC THAN THE </p><p>FARC, HOWEVER, AND DEPENDING ON THE ISSUE, CANO </p><p>OCCASIONALLY ENJOYS THE PARTY\'S SUPPORT.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>BOTH CANO AND THE PARTY (HISTORICALLY, THE "BRAINS" OF THE </p><p>CAMPESINO ARMY) FEAR THEIR LOSS OF INFLUENCE AS MARULANDA </p><p>HAS TURNED TOWARD GREATER IDEOLOGICAL AND TACTICAL ACCORD </p><p>WITH THE ELN. </p><p> </p><p>26.  FEBRUARY\'S DISAPPEARANCE OF CANO\'S ASSISTANT IN </p><p>PUSHING PEACE, FARC MEMBER DANIEL GARCIA, IS EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>FARC/PCC HARDLINERS ARE WILLING TO GET TOUGH.  SHORTLY </p><p>BEFORE HE VANISHED, GARCIA (WHOM THE FARC "TRIED" TWICE </p><p>FOR THE BOTCHED 1989 "COPACABANA" ARMS DEAL) REPORTEDLY </p><p>SAID HIS ORDEAL WAS "THE FIRST CHAPTER IN A BOOK ABOUT </p><p>CANO."  AT THE JULY 4 RECEPTION, GEN. MANUEL BONNET, THE </p><p>PREVIOUS HEAD OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, TOLD POLOFF HE </p><p>COULDN\'T BELIEVE CANO RECENTLY HAD OPTED TO RETURN TO HIS </p><p>GUERRILLA COMRADES IN THE COLOMBIAN JUNGLE.  CANO, WHO WAS </p><p>VILIFIED (ALONG WITH GARCIA) AND TEMPORARILY DUMPED AS </p><p>FARC NEGOTIATOR AT A JOINT FARC/PCC MEETING THE LAST TIME </p><p>HE RETURNED HOME, IS KNOWN TO FEAR THAT EACH RETURN TO THE </p><p>BUSH COULD REPRESENT THE BOOK\'S FINAL CHAPTER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RAUL REYES:  THE PARTY\'S MAN </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>27.  RAUL REYES, THE FARC\'S THIRD-RANKING LEADER, IS IN </p><p>CHARGE OF LOGISTICS AND FINANCES.  IT\'S REYES WHO </p><p>DISPENSES FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE PCC AND THE FARC\'S URBAN </p><p>FRONTS.  LIKE CANO, REYES IS A POLITICAL LEADER WITH NO </p><p>MILITARY EXPERIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>28.  REYES IS THE KEY MAN INSIDE THE FARC IN THE GUERRILLA </p><p>GROUP\'S SIBLING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY.  WHILE ALL FIVE FARC SECRETARIAT MEMBERS ARE PCC </p><p>MEMBERS, REYES SERVES AS "THE PARTY\'S MAN" INSIDE THE </p><p>FARC.  WHILE HIS FELLOW SECRETARIAT MEMBERS, WHETHER </p><p>MILITARY OR POLITICAL TYPES, WHETHER CAMPESINOS OR </p><p>INTELLECTUALS, HAVE CLOSER TIES TO THE INSURGENCY THAN TO </p><p>THE PARTY, REYES IS MORE COMMUNIST THAN GUERRILLA.  IN </p><p>THAT RESPECT, REYES IS UNIQUE IN THE FARC HIERARCHY.  FROM </p><p>JACOBO ARENAS TO ALFONSO CANO, THE PARTY, AS A RULE, HAS </p><p>LOST CONTROL OVER THE YOUNG ACTIVISTS IT HAS SENT TO THE </p><p>FARC TO MAINTAIN ITS CONTROL OVER THE INSURGENCY. </p><p> </p><p>29.  REYES IS LINKED TO THE PARTY\'S MOST INFLUENTIAL AND </p><p>RADICAL FACTION, LED BY PARTY SECRETARIAT MEMBER MANUAL </p><p>CEPEDA.  REYES\' MAIN POINT OF CONTACT IN THE PCC IS PARTY </p><p>ORGANIZATION SECRETARY (AND CEPEDA-FACTION NUMBER) MILLER </p><p>CHACON ("MISAEL"), WHO REGULARLY TRAVELS FROM BOGOTA TO </p><p>THE FARC\'S SECRETARIAT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TIMOLEON JIMENEZ:  A BROWN-NOSE TO HIS MENTOR, TIROFIJO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>30.  TIMOLEON JIMENEZ ("TIMOCHENCO") IS FOURTH IN COMMAND </p><p>AND IN CHARGE OF MILITARY OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>31.  A CAMPESINO, JIMENEZ JOINED THE FARC AT 13, AND EARLY </p><p>WAS "ADOPTED" BY MARULANDA, WITH WHOM HE HAS BEEN EVER </p><p>SINCE.  THE ADOLESCENT JIMENEZ FIRST WAS USED AS A GOPHER </p><p>FOR THE SECRETARIAT, THEN LATER AS A COURIER.  AS A </p><p>TEEN-AGER, JIMENEZ SERVED AS A "STAFF ASSISTANT" TO THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT.  HE GREW UP WITH THE SECRETARIAT, AT </p><p>TIROFIJO\'S SIDE. </p><p> </p><p>32.  WHILE MARULANDA HAS MANY SONS IN THE FARC, NONE HAVE </p><p>SPENT AS MUCH TIME WITH HIM OR ARE AS CLOSE TO HIM AS </p><p>JIMENEZ, HIS CHOSEN PROTEGE.  THERE IS LIKELY NO ONE THE </p><p>PARANOID TIROFIJO TRUSTS MORE.  JIMENEZ IS THE ONE MEMBER </p><p>OF THE SECRETARIAT WHO IS NEVER SEPARATED FROM TIROFI)O. </p><p>33.  JIMENEZ IS A REPLICA OF MARULANDA.  LIKE HIS MENTOR, </p><p>JIMENEZ IS AN UNEDUCATED CAMPESINO; A MILITARY LEADER (AND </p><p>A NOTED ONE) NOT A POLITICAL ONE.  LIKE TIROFIJO, JIMENEZ </p><p>HAS NO FORMAL MILITARY TRAINING, AND HAS NEVER TRAVELED TO </p><p>CUBA OR THE EAST BLOC. </p><p> </p><p>34.  WHILE FAR FROM BRILLIANT, JIMENEZ IS SMART ENOUGH TO </p><p>KNOW WHAT SIDE HIS BREAD IS BUTTERED ON.  HE ALWAYS AGREES </p><p>WITH TIROFIJO.  MARULANDA BELIEVES IN CONTINUING THE ARMED </p><p>STRUGGLE, THEREFORE SO DOES JIMENEZ. </p><p> </p><p>35.  WHILE JIMENEZ IS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS FELLOW </p><p>SECRETARIAT MEMBERS CANO, REYES AND MARQUEZ, HE REPRESENTS </p><p>A DIFFERENT CURRENT OF GUERRILLA LEADER.  WHILE THEY </p><p>JOINED THE FARC AFTER UNIVERSITY STUDIES AND CIVIL </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVISM, JIMENEZ AND OTHERS OF HIS ILK ARE </p><p>CAMPESINOS WHO GREW UP IN THE INSURGENCY. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>IVAN MARQUEZ:  "MORE AMBITION THAN BRAINS" </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>36.  WHEN FARC HEAD JACOBO ARENAS DIED IN AUGUST 1990, AND THE </p><p>REMAINING FOUR FARC GENERAL SECRETARIAT MEMBERS ALL MOVED </p><p>UP A NOTCH (WITH SECOND-IN-COMMANDER MARULANDA REPLACING </p><p>ARENAS), IVAN MARQUEZ WAS ELEVATED TO THE GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARIAT\'S FIFTH AND LOWEST POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>37.  THE SECRETARIAT\'S NEWEST MEMBER IS UNIQUE IN HAVING </p><p>BOTH MILITARY AND POLITICAL CAPABILITY.  MARQUEZ IS A </p><p>PROVEN MILITARY LEADER WITH POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, HAVING </p><p>SERVED BOTH AS A PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) CONGRESSMAN AND A </p><p>CGSB/FARC NEGOTIATOR IN BOTH THE CARACAS AND TLAXCALA </p><p>ROUNDS OF THE PEACE TALKS.  AS HEAD OF THE FARC\'S SOUTHERN </p><p>BLOC IN HIS NATIVE CAQUETA DEPARTMENT BEFORE JOINING THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT, MARQUEZ EARNED RESPECT FOR HIS MILITARY </p><p>LEADERSHIP CAPABILITIES, HAVING ONCE WIPED OUT A </p><p>PARAMILITARY GROUP IN PUTUMAYO DEPARTMENT LINKED TO </p><p>MEDELLIN CARTEL CAPO GONZALO RODRIQUEZ GACHA. </p><p> </p><p>38.  MARQUEZ ALSO IS THE SECRETARIAT\'S MOST ENIGMATIC </p><p>MEMBER.  SOURCES HAVE DIFFERED OVER WHETHER HE IS A </p><p>HARDLINER.  AMONG THOSE DENYING MARQUEZ IS A WARMONGER IS </p><p>FORMER COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST ROBERTO SAENZ, BROTHER OF </p><p>MARQUEZ\' NEGOTIATING PARTNER, ALFONSO CANO.  PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>PEACE ADVISER GONZALO DE FRANCISCO HAS DESCRIBED MARQUEZ </p><p>AS "A HARDLINER THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO BUSINESS WITH." </p><p> </p><p>39.  THE TRUTH MAY BE, AS ACADEMIC GUERRILLA EXPERT AND </p><p>EX-COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST EDUARDO PIZARRO HAS </p><p>REPORTED, THAT MARQUEZ "IS NOT A MAN TO LET HIS HEART GET </p><p>IN THE WAY OF HIS AMBITION."  PEACE PROCESS PUSHER MORITZ </p><p>AKERMAN, WHO KNOWS MARQUEZ, HAS CHARACTERIZED HIM AS FIRST </p><p>AND FOREMOST AN AMBITIOUS OPPORTUNIST WHO "BLOWS WITH THE </p><p>PREVAILING WIND."  PIZARRO THINKS THAT MARQUEZ SHARES </p><p>CANO\'S BELIEF THAT THE INSURGENCY IS A DEAD-END, BUT THE </p><p>PREVAILING WIND HAPPENS TO COME FROM THE DIRECTION OF </p><p>DOMINANT FARC/PCC HARDLINERS, AND THUS SO BLOWS MARQUEZ. </p><p> </p><p>40.  MARQUEZ HAS VARIOUSLY BEEN REPORTED TO BE IN ACCORD </p><p>WITH CANO, HIS FELLOW FARC NEGOTIATOR, AND AT ODDS WITH </p><p>HIM, WHETHER OUT OF CONVICTION OR BECAUSE OF COMPETING </p><p>AMBITIONS.  MARQUEZ REPORTEDLY SHARES CANO\'S DREAM OF A </p><p>POST-INSURGENCY, POLITICAL CAREER; HOWEVER, WHILE CANO IS </p><p>INTELLECTUALLY BRILLIANT, MARQUEZ IS MEDIOCRE.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>NOT AN UNEDUCATED CAMPESINO LIKE MARULANDA, MARQUEZ LACKS </p><p>CANO\'S INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT.  AKERMAN HAS DESCRIBED </p><p>MARQUEZ AS HAVING "MORE AMBITION THAN BRAINS.\'\' </p><p> </p><p>41.  MARQUEZ REPORTEDLY WAS NAMED TO THE FARC NEGOTIATING </p><p>TEAM (A) BECAUSE OF HIS POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, (B) BECAUSE </p><p>HE WANTED THE CHANCE IN THE LIMELIGHT, AND (C) TO KEEP AN </p><p>EYE ON CHIEF FARC NEGOTIATOR CANO, WHO\'S TOO MODERATE TO </p><p>HAVE THE FULL CONFIDENCE OF HIS FELLOW SECRETARIAT MEMBERS </p><p>AND THE PCC.  WHEN AFTER THE CARACAS TALKS CANO WAS </p><p>VILIFIED AND TEMPORARILY YANKED AS THE FARC NEGOTIATOR FOR </p><p>BEING TOO SOFT, MARQUEZ WAS NAMED TO HEAD THE NEW HARDLINE </p><p>FARC DELEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>42.  MARQUEZ\' AMBITIONS ARE POLITICAL, NOT MILITARY; HE </p><p>WANTS TO BE THE NEXT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, NOT REPLACE </p><p>TIROFIJO.  IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT HE VIEWS CANO </p><p>(RATHER THAN, FOR EXAMPLE, TIMOLEON JIMENEZ) AS HIS RIVAL, </p><p>EVEN IF THEY MAY BE IN IDEOLOGICAL ACCORD. </p><p> </p><p>43.  MARQUEZ, WHO RECENTLY TOLD AKERMAN HE RECEIVED </p><p>TRAINING IN THE SOVIET UNION,  REPORTEDLY HARBORS DEEP </p><p>HATRED FOR COLOMBIA\'S SECURITY FORCES, WHO TORTURED AND </p><p>KILLED A NON-GUERRILLA BROTHER OF HIS IN CAQUETA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSION:  NONE OF THE DWARFS CAN REPLACE SNOW WHITE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>44.  DURING HIS LATE JUNE TRIP TO TLAXCALA, MEXICO, </p><p>AKERMAN FOR THE FIRST TIME HEARD FARC GUERRILLAS TALKING </p><p>ABOUT SUCCESSION TO MARULANDA.  OVER A MEAL, FARC </p><p>NEGOTIATORS PABLO CATATUMBO AND TOMAS LINCE -- BOTH CANO </p><p>SUPPORTERS -- SAID THE PERSON MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED </p><p>MARULANDA WAS TIMOLEON JIMENEZ.  JIMENEZ WAS SAID TO ENJOY </p><p>THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING MARULANDA\'S MOST TRUSTED </p><p>CONFIDANT, AND OF HAVING THE SUPPORT OF JORGE BRICENO </p><p>SUAREZ ("MONO JOJOY"), HEAD OF THE ESTADO MAYOR DEL BLOQUE </p><p>ORIENTAL (EMBO), THE FIVE FARC FRONTS WHOSE PRINCIPAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT THE FARC GENERAL SECRETARIAT. </p><p> </p><p>45.  CATATUMBO AND LINCE NAMED MONO JOJOY AS THE SECOND </p><p>MOST LIKELY TO REPLACE MARULANDA (AFTER JIMENEZ).  MONO </p><p>JOJOY REPORTEDLY IS THE SECRETARIAT\'S FIRST ALTERNATE, </p><p>MEANING HE\'S NEXT IN LINE TO ASCEND TO THE FIVE-MEMBER </p><p>BODY.  JIMENEZ AND MONO JOJOY ARE THE FARC\'S SECOND AND </p><p>THIRD RANKING MILITARY LEADERS BEHIND MARULANDA.  THE </p><p>FARC\'S ESTADO MAYOR (SECOND-TIER LEADERSHIP BODY) AND </p><p>CAMPESINO RANK AND FILE APPEAR TO HAVE A BIAS IN FAVOR OF </p><p>CAMPESINO/MILITARY LEADERS OVER INTELLECTUAL/POLITICAL </p><p>ONES (LIKE CANO AND REYES). </p><p> </p><p>46.  THERE IS A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN STATUTE INSIDE THE </p><p>FARC, HOWEVER, BETWEEN MARULANDA AND THE OTHER FOUR </p><p>SECRETARIAT MEMBERS.  AKERMAN HAS REFERRED TO THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT AS "SNOW WHITE AND THE FOUR DWARFS" TO </p><p>ILLUSTRATE THAT DIFFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>47.  THE FARC FACES A LONG-TERM PROBLEM OF SUCCESSION FOR </p><p>WHICH THERE APPEARS TO BE NO SOLUTION.  MARULANDA, AS </p><p>RESPECTED AS HE IS INSIDE THE FARC, IS INCAPABLE OF FULLY </p><p>REPLACING ARENAS, WHO WAS A MILITARY, POLITICAL AND </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL GIANT.  THERE IS NO ONE, HOWEVER, TO REPLACE </p><p>MARULANDA.  CANO OR REYES, AS INTELLECTUALS IN A CAMPESINO </p><p>ARMY, NEVER WOULD BE ACCEPTED BY THE RANK AND FILE. </p><p>JIMENEZ, WHILE CUT FROM THE SAME MOLD AS MARULANDA, LACKS </p><p>TIROFIJO\'S SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE.  IT IS THE HISTORICAL </p><p>FIGURE OF MARULANDA THAT HAS HELD THE FARC TOGETHER SINCE </p><p>ARENAS\' DEATH.  IN AN ARMY WITH ONE GENERAL AND SEVERAL </p><p>COLONELS, THE COLONELS WILL PROBABLY GO THEIR SEPARATE </p><p>WAYS ONCE THE GENERAL HAS DEPARTED THE SCENE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BUSBY </p><p></p></div>
