<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001952 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, PHUM, KJUS, KDEM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: RIOS MONTT REGISTERED AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1944 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affiars David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and ( </p><p>d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: FRG leader Efrain Rios Montt was registered </p><p>as a presidential candidate on July 31, following a ruling by </p><p>the Constitutional Court ordering the electoral institutions </p><p>to carry out its decision to that effect of July 14 and void </p><p>all appeals.  Opposition and civil society leaders called the </p><p>decision "illegitimate" and "the beginning of electoral </p><p>fraud," and presidential candidates called on the people to </p><p>defeat Rios Montt at the ballot box.  OAS Electoral </p><p>Observation Mission reps expect the decision to put an </p><p>effective end to legal challenges to Rios Montt\'s candidacy. </p><p>While recognizing the lack of transparency of the decision, </p><p>the OAS reps did not question its constitutionality.  With </p><p>the standoff over Rios Montt\'s participation in the elections </p><p>now, apparently, resolved, attention will shift from the </p><p>courts to the campaign trail.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On July 30, the Constitutional Court ordered the </p><p>Registry of Persons and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to </p><p>enforce its decision of July 14, allowing the registration of </p><p>former General Efrain Rios Montt as a presidential candidate </p><p>in the upcoming elections.  The decision of the high court </p><p>further instructed the Supreme Court to dismiss all appeals </p><p>against this ruling, and to not accept further appeals which </p><p>would frustrate the ruling of the Constitutional Court.  The </p><p>Constitutional Court ordered the lower courts to comply with </p><p>this decision within twelve hours. The Supreme Electoral </p><p>Tribunal and Registry of Persons convened during the night of </p><p>July 30 to carry out its instruction.  Rios Montt was given </p><p>his credentials as a presidential candidate before the 6 a.m. </p><p>deadline. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Opposition and civil society leaders immediately </p><p>criticized the court\'s decision.  The decision was described </p><p>as "partisan" and "illegitimate" by practically all </p><p>opposition leaders quoted in the press, and some called it </p><p>"the beginning of electoral fraud."  GANA presidential </p><p>candidate Oscar Berger told reporters that "the resolution </p><p>may be legal, but it is illegitimate.  Our strategy should be </p><p>to win at the ballot box on November 9."  Presidential </p><p>candidates Bueso and Paiz said that the decision was a bad </p><p>one, but said it had to be accepted ("acatado").  Others in </p><p>civil society argued that the ruling was unconstitutional, </p><p>and that no one was obligated to carry out illegal orders. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Members of the Dialogue Group (made up of Ambassadors </p><p>of donor nations and heads of international organizations and </p><p>international financial institutions) were meeting at the </p><p>time the Constitutional Court\'s decision was announced.  The </p><p>unexpected decision by the court was viewed across the board </p><p>as a manipulation by the FRG, but there was a consensus that </p><p>resolving the issue once and for all -- even in Rios Montt\'s </p><p>favor -- did less violence to the electoral process than the </p><p>possibility of endless appeals and potential legal actions </p><p>against other candidacies. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) OAS Election Observation Mission member Moises Benamor </p><p>told us on the evening of July 30 that they believe the </p><p>Constitutional Court\'s decision will effectively put an end </p><p>to legal challenges to Rios Montt\'s candidacy.  While there </p><p>are other appeals that could be filed and courts that may be </p><p>prepared to accept them, the Constitutional Court\'s decision </p><p>will put Rios Montt on the ballot and will deprive further </p><p>appeals of their basis in law.  Benamor believes the Court\'s </p><p>finding will increase the level of political tension and </p><p>distrust in the electoral process, but stopped short of </p><p>questioning its constitutionality. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Constitutional Court\'s unexpected July 30 ruling </p><p>came about when the FRG filed a motion calling on the high </p><p>court to enforce its ruling of July 14.  To hear this </p><p>request, the Court held a lottery (note: there is some debate </p><p>about the transparency of this lottery. End note) to select </p><p>an alternate justice to replace recused judge Saul Dighero. </p><p>Francisco Palomo (an FRG loyalist) was selected  (Note: </p><p>Anti-FRG justices had been selected in the two previous </p><p>lotteries.  With two out of five alternate magistrates being </p><p>supporters of the FRG, it was only a matter of time before a </p><p>lottery selected one of them, giving Rios Montt a 3-to-2 </p><p>majority. End note).  This newly conformed Court voted to </p><p>have the original members who issued the July 14 decision </p><p>resolve the FRG\'s request to have its decision enforced. </p><p>Predictably enough, they voted to order the Supreme Electoral </p><p>Tribunal and Registry of Persons to implement their decision. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) There has been little popular reaction to this latest </p><p>development.  News reports claim that FRG leaders met at the </p><p>Presidential Palace on the night of July 30 to celebrate. </p><p>There were also unconfirmed reports of small numbers of FRG </p><p>supporters gathered at the Supreme Electoral Tribunal on the </p><p>morning of July 31 to celebrate.  There have been no reports </p><p>of opposition protests. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment:  As one presidential candidate told </p><p>reporters, "nothing should surprise us anymore."  The legal </p><p>actions for and against Rios Montt\'s candidacy have broken </p><p>new ground and stretched the interpretations of Guatemala\'s </p><p>constitution in precedent-setting ways.  Those who have used </p><p>the courts to challenge Rios Montt\'s candidacy can be </p><p>expected to continue seeking legal avenues for their appeal. </p><p>However, the Constitutional Court\'s decision will effectively </p><p>move the debate from the legal arena to the campaign trail. </p><p>LINDWALL </p><p></p></div>
