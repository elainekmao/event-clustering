<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 001869 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS TO PEACE CORPS DIRECTOR GADDI </p><p>VASQUES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, AMGT, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  REOPENING IN SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  As you know, a security assessment team visited Sri </p><p>Lanka a few months ago to investigate whether the Peace </p><p>Corps could safely reopen its mission here.  At the </p><p>moment, we are awaiting a second inspection of Sri Lanka </p><p>by members of your staff who can determine the </p><p>programmatic and administrative priorities should a </p><p>mission by reestablished.  I want to reiterate how </p><p>important I and our Country Team regard the Peace Corps\' </p><p>returning to Sri Lanka.  Although it is too early to </p><p>predict confidently that a peace agreement will be signed </p><p>between the government and the LTTE, it appears very </p><p>likely that a prolonged period of ceasefire is in </p><p>prospect.  Already, eight months have passed without </p><p>violence.  The new government of Sri Lanka has repeatedly </p><p>asked me to urge an early return by the Peace Corps.  The </p><p>Prime Minister himself has frequently raised the subject </p><p>with me, and in particular sees a vital role for the Peace </p><p>Corps in teaching English and perhaps business education. </p><p> </p><p>2.  I know you face many pressures to reopen the Peace </p><p>Corps or expand its operations in various countries.  I </p><p>sincerely hope you will determine soon that the Peace </p><p>Corps should reopen in Sri Lanka ASAP.  The Peace Corps is </p><p>one of America\'s noblest endeavors internationally and it </p><p>certainly has that reputation here from its many years of </p><p>service to Sri Lanka and the United States. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
