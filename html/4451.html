(C) The Honduran state-owned electricity company ENEE </p><p>announced that Honduran company Lufussa was the winner of the </p><p>210MW electricity tender, ignoring Lufussa\'s failure to </p><p>comply with bid requirements and serious allegations of </p><p>impropriety.  ENEE\'s decision represents a heavy blow for </p><p>U.S. company AES, which seeks to build a USD 600 million </p><p>combined cycle plant producing 850 MW of energy, fueled by </p><p>liquefied natural gas.  AES has identified a number of </p><p>weaknesses in the decision and plans to challenge the </p><p>contract award through administrative and judicial channels, </p><p>if necessary.  The GOH has not adequately explained these </p><p>apparent discrepancies to date.  Embassy recommends that the </p><p>USG support AES in its challenge of the bid results.  While </p><p>post does not necessarily recommend a direct linkage between </p><p>this issue and USG assistance, it would be helpful to delay </p><p>any announcements of new assistance or initiatives at this </p><p>time.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>ENEE ANNOUNCES LUFUSSA BEAT OUT AES, WITHOUT SUBSTANTIATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On November 15, the Board of Directors of the </p><p>state-owned electricity company ENEE announced Honduran </p><p>company Lufussa (owned by the Kafie family) was the winner of </p><p>the 210MW electricity tender.  ENEE indicated that Lufussa </p><p>had provided the lowest evaluated price per kilowatt hour of </p><p>$.04638, followed by Comercial Laeisz at $.04797, AES at </p><p>$.04825, ENERSA at $.04847, NAINSA at $.05078 and El Triunfo </p><p>at $.05337.  No documentation was provided on the assumptions </p><p>underlying these calculations.  The official notification of </p><p>the results was delivered to the bidders on November 19. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ENEE\'s decision, if not overturned, represents a heavy </p><p>blow for U.S. company AES, which seeks to build a USD 600 </p><p>million combined cycle plant producing 850 MW of energy, </p><p>fueled by liquefied natural gas.  Successful acquisition of </p><p>this contract would have provided AES sufficient security of </p><p>demand, along with its contracts in El Salvador, to complete </p><p>financing arrangements and begin construction of the plant </p><p>and LNG terminal.  AES is concerned about perceived </p><p>irregularities and a lack of transparency in the evaluation </p><p>process.  They continue to seek the supporting documentation. </p><p> Post expects the company to issue a challenge to the bid </p><p>award by November 26.  If the appeal is denied and AES </p><p>decides to sue in the courts for redress, this challenge </p><p>could tie up the tender for months or even years, thus </p><p>delaying the GOH\'s phase-out of extremely expensive </p><p>short-term electricity contracts. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The USG (both at the Embassy and in Washington) has </p><p>heavily advocated for a fair and transparent process (ref c). </p><p> In the past month, Embassy approaches have been complemented </p><p>by letters from Commerce Secretary Evans and Under Secretary </p><p>of State for Economic, Business and Agricultural Affairs Alan </p><p>Larson.  EmbOffs have been repeatedly assured by numerous </p><p>high level Honduran officials, including President Maduro, of </p><p>their commitment to a transparent and technically correct </p><p>process.  Nonetheless, serious flaws in the GOH\'s management </p><p>of the process have emerged. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On November 18, Minister of the Presidency Luis </p><p>Cosenza and presidential counselor Ramon Medina Luna met with </p><p>Ambassador and DCM to explain the GOH\'s position on the </p><p>results of the project.  Cosenza started by explaining the </p><p>process used to ensure fairness and transparency - the </p><p>Evaluation Committee included representatives from Probidad </p><p>Administrativa (the GOH\'s ethics office), the Attorney </p><p>General\'s office, and the Controleria (akin to the OMB or </p><p>GAO).  A transparency committee of outside observers was also </p><p>formed to certify that all procedures were followed </p><p>correctly.  There was unanimity among all the representatives </p><p>on the results of the bid.  Given this unanimity, Cosenza </p><p>asserted that there was no defendable way for the Board of </p><p>Directors of ENEE to disregard the recommendation or for the </p><p>President to refuse to sign off on it.  Cosenza also </p><p>explained that there was a five-week delay in announcement of </p><p>the bid results to accommodate a request from new officials </p><p>in Probidad Administrativa to have time to review the whole </p><p>process.  Although the GOH was aware that the delay would add </p><p>to questions about the fairness of the process, it was </p><p>necessary to let Probidad\'s review take its course. </p><p>6. (C) During the meeting with Cosenza, Ambassador and DCM </p><p>questioned the lack of availability of the data on which the </p><p>decision was based, the lack of action on allegations of </p><p>impropriety, and the failure to disqualify national firms </p><p>early in the process who failed to meet the minimum </p><p>requirements of the bid.  Cosenza was apparently nervous and </p><p>defensive throughout the meeting, but did not acknowledge GOH </p><p>failings in these areas.  At the end of the meeting, Cosenza </p><p>offered to send the members of the transparency committee to </p><p>the Embassy to brief the Ambassador personally.  The meeting </p><p>is scheduled to take place on Friday morning, November 22. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>AREAS OF CONCERN </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) AES has identified a number of categories of problems </p><p>in the transparency and fairness of the bid process, </p><p>including lack of transparency and data, unfair evaluation </p><p>criteria, and a lack of action by the GOH on possible </p><p>corruption among the participants in the evaluation.  The </p><p>GOH\'s responses have been legalistic and vague, to date. </p><p> </p><p>Unsubstantiated Price Calculations </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) AES alleges a lack of transparency and fairness on the </p><p>calculation of evaluated price: no documentation regarding </p><p>price analysis or methodology has been received to date.  In </p><p>response to separate Embassy and AES inquiries, the GOH has </p><p>promised that the transparency committee, established by ENEE </p><p>to monitor the evaluation committee\'s work, will give </p><p>briefings on the process.  This clearly begs the question. </p><p>Customarily, an evaluation of price consists of application </p><p>of a formula based on price bids, estimates on fuel costs and </p><p>estimates of transmission loss. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) AES calculates that with some assumptions, Lufussa </p><p>could have had a lower evaluated price before transmission </p><p>loss, but after transmission loss is taken into account </p><p>(since its transmission losses should be about 20 percent </p><p>lower than Lufussa\'s) AES would come into first place albeit </p><p>at a small margin.  According to AES\' calculations, there are </p><p>no scenarios under which Comercial Laiesz could have had a </p><p>lower cost.   Note: Minister of the Presidency Cosenza and </p><p>ENEE General Manager Botazzi, although both are electrical </p><p>engineers, have professed lack of familiarity with the </p><p>evaluation formula and the results.  They claim to have </p><p>relied totally on the results of the Evaluation Committee and </p><p>the Transparency Committee.  AES terms it "incredible" that </p><p>the GOH would have announced a winner without even doing a </p><p>cursory view of the calculations or having the information </p><p>ready.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>Lack of Disqualification of top bidders for failures of their </p><p>bids to meet tender package requirements </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) AES has strongly argued all along that Lufussa should </p><p>have been disqualified by ENEE for failure to include in its </p><p>offer a transmission line and all related infrastructure. </p><p>Clause 2.1 of the draft contract and Addendum 4 of the </p><p>package, required transmission lines and all related </p><p>infrastructure needed to deliver committed capacity and </p><p>energy be included.  According to AES, Lufussa did not make a </p><p>commitment to build the $20 million transmission line until </p><p>it received the second round of requests for clarification by </p><p>the evaluation committee.  In the case of Comercial Laeisz, </p><p>AES believes that the company\'s offer of 155 separate 1.7 MW </p><p>motors does not meet the intent of the ENEE to receive bids </p><p>for "base load" capacity. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) GOH officials (including Cosenza, ENEE leadership and </p><p>all participants in the evaluation and transparency </p><p>committees) are insisting that Honduran law allows Lufussa to </p><p>remedy the initial lack of transmission capability in a later </p><p>round of clarifications.  AES flatly refutes this, noting </p><p>that transmission capability was a required technical </p><p>parameter and a variable that impacts the economic offer and </p><p>that Lufussa should have been disqualified at that point. </p><p>The GOH has given no explanation of the lack of </p><p>disqualification of Comercial Laiesz. </p><p> </p><p>Price Evaluation Methodology </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ENEE issued changes to the price evaluation </p><p>methodology throughout the spring of 2002, in light of </p><p>comments and questions made by participants in the tender. </p><p>AES contested the key points in the methodology (fuel </p><p>evaluation, variable costs, economic dispatch and others) in </p><p>a letter on June 5 but received no response from ENEE as </p><p>required under bid terms. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) AES complains that one of these changes allowed high </p><p>fuel prices in April 2002 to give a 16 percent advantage on </p><p>variable fuel costs to the evaluated prices of bidders using </p><p>bunker fuel (a counterintuitive result since high oil prices </p><p>should not make a bidder more attractive).   Variable fuel </p><p>costs represent approximately one-half of the overall price. </p><p>AES\' competitors were also given a large advantage when ENEE </p><p>decided not to take into account the fact that AES\' total </p><p>variable costs are 45 percent lower than Lufussa because of </p><p>the efficiency of combined cycle technology.  The GOH\'s bland </p><p>response to these arguments is that ENEE tried to be balanced </p><p>in deciding on the evaluation criteria, adding that "while </p><p>some decisions may have worked to AES\' disadvantage, others </p><p>worked in their favor" (e.g. the decision to allow 24 months </p><p>for plant construction). </p><p> </p><p>GOH Allowed Opportunities for Manipulation of the Process </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) AES reports that on at least four separate occasions, </p><p>individuals purporting to either represent other bidders or </p><p>to have influence with the GOH have contacted AES regarding </p><p>the possibility of a negotiated solution, such as dividing </p><p>the bid among certain participants or suggesting that AES </p><p>Honduras could be allowed to win, for a fee.  On two other </p><p>occasions, internal documents belonging to the evaluation </p><p>committee were offered for sale to AES Honduras (and </p><p>refused).  GOH officials acknowledged that they were aware of </p><p>these allegations but because "they did not affect the final </p><p>decision" took no action to investigate.  AES argues that </p><p>this lack of action, combined with the GOH\'s continuous </p><p>insistence that the process was transparent, sent a message </p><p>that there would be no serious consequences for such action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AES had the better project </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) AES argues that any of the above factors should have </p><p>allowed the ENEE and GOH to award the contract to AES.  In </p><p>addition, AES thinks that the government should have </p><p>considered the additional benefits of the AES project: the </p><p>AES project would entail a USD 600 million investment, three </p><p>times the size of the closest competition, with attendant </p><p>benefits for government tax revenue, export promotion, </p><p>foreign exchange earnings, regional integration, energy </p><p>diversification and competitiveness of Honduran industry. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) GOH officials, however, have not been in agreement </p><p>with this concept.  In conversations with Ambassador and DCM </p><p>over the last few months, they have repeatedly emphasized </p><p>that the bids need to be decided on the basis of the </p><p>evaluation criteria established in the tender package.  This </p><p>argument is somewhat disingenuous.  ENEE is a state-owned </p><p>company and should have designed evaluation criteria that </p><p>would attract the best possible project. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>PUBLIC REACTION AND PRESS COVERAGE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) Reporting on this issue ranges from straight </p><p>reporting to wait-and-see to critical.  El Heraldo and La </p><p>Prensa have been especially caustic, reporting that the </p><p>winning company had failed to meet the requirements of the </p><p>solicitation and that it should never have been allowed to </p><p>participate.  Reporting on the Ambassador\'s comments to media </p><p>following his November 18 meeting with Cosenza and Medina, an </p><p>HRN radio editorial agreed with the Ambassador that the </p><p>decision could have an adverse impact on foreign investment </p><p>and would make it more difficult for average citizens to </p><p>receive a low-priced, efficient and environmentally clean </p><p>energy system.  HRN also said that it had warned people that </p><p>various sectors of society had an interest in having the </p><p>contract go to Lufussa, in spite of its failure to comply </p><p>with the norms.  The program director of Hoy Mismo, a widely </p><p>respected national television news program, discussed the </p><p>Ambassador\'s comments with COHEP president Regalado on the </p><p>evening program yesterday.  The director said that there were </p><p>many questions about the process, among them the question of </p><p>who had appointed the Commission on Transparency and what </p><p>their qualifications were.  He asked why COHEP was not asking </p><p>some of the same questions about the process and was told </p><p>that the government had assured COHEP that the process was </p><p>transparent and fair. </p><p>18. (U) An editorial in his newspaper, Tiempo, by Jaime </p><p>Rosenthal -- Congressional deputy, businessman and long-time </p><p>critic of the AES project -- predicted that within a year, </p><p>the government would open another bidding process for an </p><p>additional 200 megawatts, since he doesn\'t think that Lufussa </p><p>can produce additional electricity with the outdated plants </p><p>that they will have to continue using.  He also said that a </p><p>culture of suspicion is the sad reality of Honduras and </p><p>worse, that the trials take place in the media, (not in the </p><p>courts). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>NEXT STEPS OPEN TO AES </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) AES and other bidders have the right to appeal the </p><p>tender award within five to ten days of the official </p><p>notification of the result.  The appeal would be decided by </p><p>the Board of Directors of ENEE.  Once the appeal is received, </p><p>ENEE would have 40 to 60 days to decide on the motion.  Once </p><p>administrative procedures are completed, AES would be free to </p><p>present its case to the lower courts and eventually the </p><p>Supreme Court. (Note: the periods and procedures listed here </p><p>are imprecise because attorneys are uncertain of the effect </p><p>of a newly adopted Simplification of Administrative </p><p>Procedures law, which is only now entering into force). </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) Upon announcement of the decision on November 15, </p><p>members of the transparency committee took it upon themselves </p><p>to discourage any challenges by losing companies.  AES has </p><p>taken exception to this action.  Luis Cosenza told Ambassador </p><p>on November 18 that this discouragement of appeals was </p><p>regrettable.  The GOH reasserted the right of all bidders to </p><p>pursue potential administrative and legal avenues. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) AES Honduras representatives are in close and </p><p>frequent contact with the Embassy.  They have asked for </p><p>continued support and advocacy, and in particular, to </p><p>highlight in our public statements our concerns about </p><p>potential discrepancies.  While their first impulse is to </p><p>appeal the decision both administratively and legally, </p><p>company representatives also are starting to think about </p><p>creative redress solutions that could be negotiated (such as </p><p>a second tender offer for fuel sources other than bunker and </p><p>diesel). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>EMBASSY COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) The Embassy has always viewed this electricity </p><p>contract as a bellwether project.  If done correctly, the </p><p>government\'s management of this process could have held the </p><p>potential to reduce electricity costs dramatically, improve </p><p>government finances, improve Honduran competitiveness, </p><p>provide a large infusion of investment at a time of stagnant </p><p>economic activity, and in addition demonstrate to the inward </p><p>looking private sector that rent-seeking behavior would no </p><p>longer be tolerated. </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) Instead, the GOH has now painted itself into a corner </p><p>from which no easy escape appears possible.  First, by </p><p>failing to provide clear leadership and guidance in the </p><p>development of the evaluation criteria, the GOH has allowed </p><p>ENEE to tilt the playing field toward the domestic companies. </p><p> Representatives of Duke Energy, another U.S. company that </p><p>had been following the tender with interest, told </p><p>then-Ambassador Almaguer in March that the company would </p><p>probably not participate in the tender because of this </p><p>tendency (and Duke in fact decided not to bid).  Second, by </p><p>allowing Lufussa to win the bid despite an obvious attempt to </p><p>escape a commitment to build the costly transmission lines, </p><p>the GOH seriously discredits government procurement rules. </p><p>Third, by not making available the data on which the </p><p>evaluated prices were determined, the government has raised </p><p>the specter of real manipulation of the numbers (with the </p><p>collusion of all parts of the GOH) while at the same time </p><p>undermining its constant assertions that the process was </p><p>transparent.  Fourth, the GOH has requested USG assistance on </p><p>many economic fronts (a donation of wheat, help in urging </p><p>flexibility with the IMF, technical assistance in trade </p><p>capacity building, money laundering, tax administration, and </p><p>in a variety of other fields) at the same time that it </p><p>appears to be placing domestic political accommodation above </p><p>fairness to U.S. investors. </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) Embassy recommends that the USG support AES in its </p><p>challenge of the bid results.  The USG should be supportive </p><p>of AES\' attempt to obtain the documentation underlining the </p><p>ENEE decision and continue to highlight publicly our </p><p>questions about the fairness of the process.  We will also </p><p>encourage the GOH to review the decision carefully and to be </p><p>willing to overturn it if mistakes were made.  Allegations of </p><p>impropriety should be investigated by the GOH ambitiously. </p><p>While Post does not necessarily recommend a direct linkage </p><p>between this issue and USG assistance or support with </p><p>international financial institutions, it would be helpful to </p><p>delay any announcements of new assistance or initiatives at </p><p>this time. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
