<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000655 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ELAB, ECON, ASEC, CASC, PREF, PHUM, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: WEAVING TERROR: MAOIST ATTACKS ON CARPET INDUSTRY </p><p>CONTINUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 01 KATHMANDU 2352 </p><p>     B. 01 KATHMANDU 1321 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI, REASONS 1.5(B),(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  For five minutes on the evening of March 25, </p><p>forty to fifty suspected Maoist youths terrorized a carpet </p><p>business at the edge of Nepal\'s capital city, setting fires </p><p>and causing extensive property damage.  No one was injured. </p><p>Now fearful and discouraged, the owner of the business </p><p>expressed bitterness because no one had contacted him to get </p><p>his story but added that he was too afraid to talk to anyone. </p><p> The firm had recently refused to allow radical trade union </p><p>organizers into their shop and had received written threats </p><p>and requests for money from the Maoists.  The March 25 attack </p><p>was the second in a month against Tibetan-owned carpet </p><p>businesses and continued a string of attacks stretching back </p><p>to last summer.  Nepal\'s carpet industry may never recover. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Raid on Carpet Manufacturer </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Between forty and fifty suspected Maoists invaded </p><p>the compound of the Himali Rug House in the Boudha area of </p><p>Kathmandu just after 6:00 p.m. on March 25.  In their raid, </p><p>which lasted barely five minutes, the Maoists threw a dozen </p><p>"petrol bombs" (Molotov cocktails), damaging USD thousands </p><p>worth of carpets and a new Toyota automobile.  The damage </p><p>would have been much worse but the Maoists, petrol bombs </p><p>managed to penetrate only one window - bottles thrown towards </p><p>the owner,s office missed their target - and the firm had </p><p>sent out a large shipment of carpets the day before.  No one </p><p>was injured.  It was the second attack on Kathmandu\'s carpet </p><p>firms in March. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The firm,s compound, containing the owner,s home, </p><p>a warehouse for sorting dyed wool, housing for employees, and </p><p>carpet showrooms, sits at the edge of a densely populated </p><p>area but borders an expanse of rice paddy.  A national </p><p>forest, Gokarna, lies just beyond the fields. </p><p> </p><p>Young and Out of Nowhere </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) According to eyewitnesses, the mob of Maoists was </p><p>made up of youths, none more than 25 years old, and included </p><p>six or seven girls.  They appeared as if from nowhere, </p><p>apparently having approached the scene from several </p><p>directions at once, including across the forest and through </p><p>the paddy.  After charging the gate, a few members of the </p><p>gang restrained the single guard on duty and about a dozen </p><p>stood sentinel outside while the rest rampaged through the </p><p>compound.  They asked for the boss - who was out on an errand </p><p>- but not by name. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) After consummating their terror, the mob scattered, </p><p>some running down the crowded street that leads to Boudha </p><p>stupa.  Two Bihari employees of the firm followed, screaming </p><p>to passers-by to stop the vandals, who, they yelled out, were </p><p>Maoists.  No one responded. </p><p> </p><p>No Contact </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Aside from the police, the owner had not received </p><p>inquiries from any other quarter, including journalists, </p><p>human rights organizations, victims groups, or the Office of </p><p>Tibet.  (The owner is an ethnic Tibetan holding a Nepali </p><p>passport.)  Although local newspapers covered the story, </p><p>quoting police sources, they did not contact the firm for </p><p>confirmation or comment.  The owner criticized one paper in </p><p>particular because it had put the number of invaders at only </p><p>fifteen.  Even so, he expressed a reluctance to speak with </p><p>human rights or victims groups, saying he was too scared to </p><p>talk to anyone.  The owner,s family has gone to live with </p><p>relatives.  He himself spends nights at the homes of friends, </p><p>or in hotels.  "They,re looking for me," he said.  He felt </p><p>insecure, and helpless, and could not eat. </p><p> </p><p>Labor Problems, Threats, Preceded Raid </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The owner also admitted that he had had labor problems </p><p>in the past.  When approached recently by leaders of a </p><p>radical labor union, he had declined to allow them to </p><p>organize in his shops.  He had also been solicited for </p><p>donations to the Maoist cause, and had been threatened when </p><p>he refused to pay.  Nonetheless, he did not report these </p><p>incidents to the police because he felt that they would not </p><p>be responsive, and that if he did make a report it might </p><p>cause trouble for him.  After the Maoists, raid, the police </p><p>began sending two officers to pass the night on the compound, </p><p>in the room closest to the gate. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The firm exports primarily to the U.S.; its main buyer </p><p>has been an up-scale carpet store off Union Square in New </p><p>York City.  The owner\'s daughter, age four, was born in New </p><p>York and is an American citizen.  His son, age three, holds </p><p>Nepalese citizenship. </p><p> </p><p>Carpet Makers Weaving in Terror </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The March 25 incident was the second attack on the </p><p>Kathmandu valley,s Tibetan-owned carpet businesses in the </p><p>month of March.  On March 7, a package containing explosives </p><p>was left outside a carpet showroom in the Jawalakhel area of </p><p>Patan.  Security forces moved the bomb to a nearby field, </p><p>where it detonated.  At another carpet showroom just down the </p><p>street, a similar explosive package blew up at another carpet </p><p>showroom December 3, killing two (Ref A).  And in an incident </p><p>much like the March 25 attack, several dozen suspected </p><p>Maoists in July, 2001 raided a carpet factory in Thimi, a few </p><p>miles east of the capital, setting fire to piles of carpets </p><p>with petrol bombs (Ref B).  The owner of the Thimi factory </p><p>was an ethnic Newar. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The string of attacks on carpet firms over the past </p><p>year has increasingly demoralized an industry already </p><p>suffering from sagging sales abroad and uncertain political </p><p>conditions at home.  Whether the attackers were Maoist </p><p>regulars, sympathetic unionists, or merely opportunistic </p><p>troublemakers, carpet manufacturers now live in fear, both </p><p>for their own safety and that of their families.  In most </p><p>cases, their enterprises have taken decades to build up; </p><p>employ thousands of Nepalese workers; and generate about </p><p>twenty percent of Nepal,s foreign currency earnings.  Under </p><p>current conditions, Nepal\'s carpet producers do not see how </p><p>they can reestablish reliable chains of production.  Losing </p><p>one of its few viable industries will accelerate Nepal\'s </p><p>economic disintegration and further cripple its state </p><p>finances. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
