<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LAGOS 001479 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: Attempted Coup in Anambra State: Harbinger of </p><p>Things to Come? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  A mid-July attempt by a cadre of </p><p>business and political leaders to surreptitiously </p><p>unseat a recently-elected state governor has created an </p><p>ongoing political imbroglio and leaves Nigerians and </p><p>Nigeria watchers asking if, instead of the military </p><p>coups of the past, leaders here now face gangster-style </p><p>threats to their power and safety.  Chris Ngige is back </p><p>in power in Anambra state, but for how long and to what </p><p>extent remains to be seen.  "Coup" plotters have been </p><p>expelled from the ruling party and mostly removed from </p><p>office, and prosecutors publicly state their intention </p><p>to pursue criminal charges.  Meanwhile, a federal court </p><p>has issued an injunction barring Ngige from acting as </p><p>governor, pending a lawsuit filed by those who </p><p>attempted to oust him.  President Obasanjo and his </p><p>closest advisors have remained mostly out of the public </p><p>fray, but the botched "civilian coup" continues to keep </p><p>his party and political leaders at both the federal and </p><p>state level reeling.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Introduction.  On July 10, Chris Ngige, governor </p><p>of Anambra State, was taken into custody and held </p><p>incommunicado by police officers led by Raphael Ige, </p><p>Assistant Inspector General of the national police for </p><p>the region.  Simultaneously, State Assembly Speaker </p><p>Eucharia Azodo delivered to legislators a purported </p><p>letter of resignation from Ngige, and the Anambra State </p><p>Assembly assented to the swearing-in by the state </p><p>attorney general of the deputy governor, Okey Udeh, as </p><p>new governor.  Later in the day, Ngige managed to call </p><p>supporters and denied that he had resigned.  He was </p><p>eventually released and regained control of the state\'s </p><p>affairs the following day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) April pre-electoral environment. Anambra State </p><p>has long been the setting for particularly </p><p>dysfunctional politics, and past events presaged what </p><p>occurred on July 10. Former Governor Chinwoke </p><p>Mbadinuju\'s relationship with the State\'s power brokers </p><p>had been as difficult as any during the last decade. </p><p>Initially beholden to political godfather Sir Emeka </p><p>Offor, Mbadinuju had refused to toe the line during </p><p>1999-2003, essentially at the expense of the common </p><p>people.  The closure of schools for a year, salary </p><p>arrears stretching ten months, and chronic </p><p>individualized and group violence characterized the </p><p>Anambra State pre-electoral environment in April 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Changing of the Guard.  Given Mbadinuju\'s </p><p>unwillingness to comply with the wishes of the ruling </p><p>power brokers, the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) </p><p>twice blocked his re-election bid for governor early in </p><p>2003. Three weeks before the April 19 gubernatorial </p><p>election, the PDP chose Ngige to run against several </p><p>contenders including Peter Obi of the All Progressives </p><p>Grand Alliance (APGA), who by some accounts would have </p><p>carried the vote had it not been for fraud perpetrated </p><p>by the PDP.  Pre-election side-deals with party power </p><p>brokers represented the price Ngige had to pay for PDP </p><p>support.  These deals would have benefited business </p><p>mogul Chris Uba, the most recently self-anointed </p><p>kingmaker in Anambra State.  Following Ngige\'s </p><p>questionable victory (which his rival is contesting), </p><p>Uba expected to name Anambra State commissioners and </p><p>other prominent members of the state government, as </p><p>well as members of Ngige\'s personal staff.  Uba also </p><p>anticipated lucrative contracts and payment of three </p><p>billion naira (approximately $24 million USD), which he </p><p>said Ngige owed for services related to his election </p><p>victory. Reports indicate Uba intended to arrange for </p><p>Ngige to eventually cede the governorship to Deputy </p><p>Governor Okechukwu Udeh.  Ngige publicly admitting </p><p>having signed a letter of resignation and preparing a </p><p>videotaped resignation before he took the oath of </p><p>office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Settlement of political debts.  Uba had thus </p><p>expected deference and a free hand to conduct business </p><p>as usual.  Once in office, Ngige punctured Uba\'s </p><p>expectations, failing to make expected payments and </p><p>maintaining control of the auspices of the governor\'s </p><p>office.  Uba responded by sending Ngige\'s purported </p><p>letter of resignation to the Speaker of the Anambra </p><p>House of Assembly, Eucharia Azodo, who is Uba\'s cousin. </p><p>Expecting to reap benefits from this raw power play, </p><p>the House quickly legitimized the attempted coup and </p><p>designated Deputy Governor Udeh, Governor. Meanwhile, </p><p>Assistant Police Inspector General Raphael Ige </p><p>dispatched 200 anti-riot police to Ngige\'s office, </p><p>abducted him, and held him in the hotel where he </p><p>resided until Ngige called for help via an unnoticed </p><p>cell phone.  Subsequent media reports generated a </p><p>public outcry that facilitated Ngige\'s return to office </p><p>on July 11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Presidency and the PDP.  In testimony </p><p>before an investigative committee of the Senate, </p><p>Governor Ngige stated that Inspector General Ige told </p><p>him the orders to restrain him came from "the big men" </p><p>in Abuja.  However, immediately after it appeared that </p><p>the attempted coup in Anambra State had failed, the </p><p>Presidency and the PDP denounced it. (Comment. A </p><p>recurring complaint heard by Emboffs is that Obasanjo </p><p>did not personally condemn the attempt, but only said </p><p>"differences should be handled within the party."  End </p><p>comment.) We have heard that at the insistence of VP </p><p>Atik, the PDP dismissed the putschists from the party, </p><p>and PDP governors called for a judicial commissio of </p><p>inquiry to probe the botched abduction of Ngge. </p><p>Professor Itse Sagay, a well-known constitutonal </p><p>lawyer in Lagos, has suggested that such a tep would </p><p>only serve to postpone and delay the cause of justice. </p><p>What the country faces, he said, s not a political </p><p>crisis, but a crime against th Constitution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Critics at large.  In letters to the editors </p><p>and other channels, critics have roundly condemned the </p><p>bungled coup.  They consider it an affront to </p><p>democracy, and many wonder how long Nigeria will </p><p>continue to be held hostage by "money-bags" who care </p><p>little about their people\'s general welfare.  For </p><p>example, novelist and political commentator Okey Ndibe </p><p>told Econoff that the link between the attempted ouster </p><p>of Ngige and President Obasanjo is clear.  Ndibe, a </p><p>former Fulbright scholar, resides mostly in the U.S. </p><p>but writes for the Guardian newspaper while in Nigeria. </p><p>Ndibe insists that Uba\'s wealth, his business dealings </p><p>with Stella Obasanjo, the President\'s wife, and his </p><p>brother\'s status as one of Obasanjo\'s personal </p><p>assistants gives him easy access to the President, who, </p><p>according to Ndibe, knew full well that members of his </p><p>party were planning an ouster of an uncooperative </p><p>governor.  Ndibe wrote a scathing editorial to this </p><p>effect on July 17 in the Guardian. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Possible legal actions.  Section 1(2) of the </p><p>1999 Nigerian Constitution stipulates that "the Federal </p><p>Republic of Nigeria shall not be governed nor shall any </p><p>part thereof, except in accordance with the provisions </p><p>of the Constitution."  And Section 41(B) of Nigeria\'s </p><p>Criminal Code stipulates "any person who forms an </p><p>intention to effect the removal of a governor of a </p><p>state during his tenure in office is guilty of a </p><p>felony."  Relying on these provisions, Bukhari Bello, a </p><p>constitutional lawyer and Executive Secretary of the </p><p>National Human Rights Commission, states there is </p><p>enough evidence to bring charges of treason against Ige </p><p>and others.  Many of the players may benefit from </p><p>immunity, however.  Section 308 of the 1999 </p><p>Constitution protects Deputy Governor Udeh from </p><p>criminal and civil prosecution, if not investigation, </p><p>unless he is impeached; currently an unlikely prospect </p><p>given the extent of support he received from the state </p><p>Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Political accommodation.  On July 14 Obasanjo </p><p>met with twenty-one PDP governors to review </p><p>developments in Anambra State, and the next day he </p><p>invited key players to Abuja.  On July 17 the PDP\'s </p><p>National Working Committee dismissed from the party </p><p>several of the actors involved in the attempt to remove </p><p>Ngige from office, including Deputy Governor Udeh and </p><p>Speaker of the Assembly Azodo.  The Anambra State </p><p>Assembly also removed Azodo from the Speaker\'s chair. </p><p>According to Presidential insiders, Police Inspector </p><p>General Tafa Balogun ordered Assistant Inspector </p><p>General Ige to retire, a rather cosmetic gesture since </p><p>Ige had planned to retire soon, and reorganized the </p><p>security teams assigned to the Government House in </p><p>Anambra.  Anambra state prosecutors have stated they </p><p>intend to file criminal charges against the plotters </p><p>behind the governor\'s kidnapping and attempted removal. </p><p>But on July 22, Justice Wilson Egbo-Egbo of the Federal </p><p>High Court in Abuja issued an injunction preventing </p><p>Ngige from acting as governor, and the PDP from taking </p><p>action against the coup plotters, until a hearing is </p><p>held on a lawsuit filed by Uba.  Ngige vowed to ignore </p><p>the ruling as inoperable against a sitting governor. </p><p>Earlier, the PDP leadership had also censured Ngige, </p><p>expressing "deep disappointment" with his </p><p>"comportment." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Comment.  Chris Ngige is a medical doctor by </p><p>profession and a political novice.  He may be back in </p><p>charge of Anambra State, but given the scope of the </p><p>plot against him, it is unlikely that he will be able </p><p>to muster support or maintain authority if he does not </p><p>learn to play ball with to those who put him in power. </p><p>It is probable that he will have to struggle for his </p><p>position in the state and in his party unless he makes </p><p>amends quickly.  His personal safety may also be in </p><p>jeopardy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Comment continued.  While the Presidency has </p><p>condemned the coup attempt, the President himself has </p><p>been strangely mute on the issue except to say that the </p><p>PDP should deal with the "disagreement" as if were a </p><p>family affair. Observers of the Nigerian political </p><p>scene will be scrutinizing subsequent developments to </p><p>see if the cabal will get away with what nearly became </p><p>the hijacking of Anambra State.  Should they remain </p><p>immune to the law, plotters with far greater ambitions </p><p>will be scanning the political horizon for similar </p><p>opportunities on a broader field.  This incident has </p><p>reflected politics in its crudest form, and revealed </p><p>that the underlying system of political payoff that </p><p>seems to be part of Nigeria\'s burgeoning democratic </p><p>process may crack the stoic veneer the ruling party has </p><p>tried to apply to its second term in power. What has </p><p>been described as an attempted civilian coup d\'tat at </p><p>the state level suggests that the country\'s democratic </p><p>framework is shakier than its leaders acknowledge.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hinson-Jones </p><p></p></div>
