Buyukanit said. He warned against using the EU as a </p><p>domestic policy tool, papers note.  "Cumhuriyet" comments </p><p>that Gen. Buyukanit has issued a warning to the </p><p>fundamentalists attempting to exploit EU norms and values in </p><p>order to make their goal a reality.  Gen. Buyukanit is </p><p>against broadcast in mother tongues, particularly in Kurdish </p><p>until the terror threat is brought to an end, papers say. </p><p>`It\'s impossible to control broadcasts in Kurdish, even on </p><p>state TV,\' Buyukanit stressed.  Meanwhile, objections from </p><p>the military wing of the National Security Council (NSC) </p><p>obliged the government to delay the EU adjustment package </p><p>until July, dailies say.  The government was planning to </p><p>enact the reforms just before the June 21 EU summit in </p><p>Thessalonica, Greece reports underline.  Foreign Minister </p><p>Gul and some cabinet members are reported as voicing the </p><p>government determination to pass the reforms as soon as </p><p>possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TUSIAD in U.S.; Gul: All papers report the visiting TUSIAD </p><p>delegation\'s call on NYT\'s William Safire in New York on </p><p>Thursday.  TUSIAD Chairman Ozilhan told Safire that some </p><p>minor disagreements should not disrupt relations between </p><p>U.S. and Turkey, according to papers.  Safire, as appeared </p><p>in an op-ed, reportedly told the delegation that the GOT </p><p>should do something to eliminate the senseless Kurdish </p><p>phobia in Turkey, adding that Ankara should put an end to </p><p>domestic pressure on Kurdish culture and language.  Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul, on his way back from the OIC meetings in </p><p>Tehran, criticized Ozilhan\'s notice to the government that </p><p>time was not yet appropriate for a high-level official </p><p>Turkish visit to the U.S. Gul reportedly said that `Turkey </p><p>has an ambassador in Washington.  Channels between U.S. and </p><p>Turkey are not blocked.  People in Turkey should cease </p><p>taking initiative for the sake of their own PR.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Foreign Minister Gul said on Thursday that he might </p><p>have the opportunity of meeting with Secretary Powell at the </p><p>NATO summit in Madrid.  Responding to a question about </p><p>Poland\'s invitation for Turkey to the international </p><p>peacekeeping mission around the Iraqi towns Najaf and </p><p>Karbala, Gul said (although not very enthusiastically) that </p><p>Turkey would consider contribution for the sake of stability </p><p>in Iraq.  Meanwhile, "Yeni Safak" reports the Northern Iraqi </p><p>KDP leader Barzani as welcoming the election of a Kurd mayor </p><p>for Kirkuk, and as stressing that he would support the </p><p>return of exiled Kurds to Kirkuk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. warns against immunity of diplomats in Iraq: Papers </p><p>report on a U.S. Administration announcement that the U.S. </p><p>would not recognize the diplomatic status of foreigners in </p><p>Iraq.  State Spokesman Boucher said the U.S. reserved the </p><p>right to deport `unwanted persons\' from Iraq, and advised </p><p>diplomats not to go there until a new administration is set </p><p>up.  Turkey\'s Baghdad embassy might be closed, papers think. </p><p>"Zaman" predicts a new `diplomatic crisis\' between </p><p>Washington and Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraqi rebuilding: "Milliyet" reports a Bechtel Corp. </p><p>announcement saying its subcontractors would be given Iraqi </p><p>reconstruction jobs between $300,000 - $1 million.  Turkey\'s </p><p>Constructors\' Association said current conditions in Iraq </p><p>are discouraging, and that the best business with the war </p><p>ravaged country would be exports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A general view </p><p>Cengiz Candar wrote in mass appeal DB-Tercuman (5/30): </p><p>"There are signals that the damaged relationship between </p><p>U.S. and Turkey can be repaired.  For instance, Turkish </p><p>troops might take part in an international peacekeeping </p><p>force for Iraq. .  However, Ankara must stay away from </p><p>meaningless and dangerous formulations such as offering to </p><p>police the holy Iraqi Shiite towns Najaf and Karbala, which </p><p>have the potential to draw Turkey into a regional blood </p><p>feud.  Foreign Minister Gul\'s OIC speech in Tehran, in which </p><p>he urged the Islamic world for reforms regarding human </p><p>rights and democracy, and his call for a search to explore </p><p>the origins of violence, can be read as an effort to repair </p><p>the strain in ties with the U.S.  Apparently, the addressee </p><p>was Washington rather than Muslims." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Changing alliances </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli commented in the tabloid Star (5/30): </p><p>"Foreign Minister Gul has supported democracy and </p><p>transparency in messages  for the Muslims at the OIC </p><p>meetings.  American sources say that lately, AKP has been </p><p>sending `back-channel\' messages to Washington, to the effect </p><p>that the U.S. can trust Turkey on Iran. .  During the </p><p>Israeli Defense Minister\'s call on Ankara earlier this week, </p><p>the AKP government and Israel have decided to carry out </p><p>`espionage cooperation\' against the Iranian threat and </p><p>terror. .  The  cold winds between Turkey\'s military and EU </p><p>seemingly affected our army\'s relationship with the U.S. as </p><p>well.  The U.S. wants a `reliable ally\' in the fragile Iraqi </p><p>geography, which is totally at odds with the Turkish army\'s </p><p>Kurdish policy.  NSC Secretary Gen. Kilinc said a year ago </p><p>that Turkey could form an alliance with Russia and Iran. </p><p>Washington, believing it was said on behalf of the Turkish </p><p>military, carefully noted that statement.  TGS Chief Ozkok\'s </p><p>latest assertion highlighting the significance that Turkey </p><p>attributes to the strategic partnership with U.S. might not </p><p>be enough to change the picture in the short term." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
