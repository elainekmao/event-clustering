<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001328 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PDA (MBUCKLEY); WHA/CEN, PD TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON ARTICLE 98, JUNE 9, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Regular columnist Ramon Villeda Bermudez on liberal daily </p><p>"La  Tribuna", Tegucigalpa based 6/7 entitled: "International </p><p>Disgrace". "The Government of Honduras has committed  one  of </p><p>the   most   degrading  acts  by  approving  a  "dishonorable </p><p>agreement"  with  the  United  States  (Article   98).   This </p><p>agreement prohibits both countries from turning over  to  the </p><p>International  Criminal Court (ICC)  any  citizen  from  both </p><p>countries  that  is  accused  of  genocide,  crimes   against </p><p>humanity or war crimes. This degrading act violates the  Rome </p><p>Statute of the ICC, which had been approved unanimously by  a </p><p>past legislature." </p><p> </p><p>"The  manner  in which this agreement was approved  was  also </p><p>irregular.  First  at  all, the bill  was  submitted  to  the </p><p>National  Congress past-midnight during the final session  of </p><p>the  legislature, after the agreement was kept in secret  for </p><p>more  than eight months since President Maduro signed  it  on </p><p>September 2002. Furthermore, this agreement was approved by a </p><p>simple   majority  of  deputies  of  the  National  Congress, </p><p>violating  a  Constitutional clause that states that  a  two- </p><p>thirds  majority  in Congress must approve all  international </p><p>agreements." </p><p> </p><p>"A  significant segment of deputies and other  social  groups </p><p>have  condemned this decision, which makes clear  the  scarce </p><p>self-esteem and sovereignty of Honduras. It is time  to  show </p><p>our gratitude to the global superpowers with more dignity." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
