(U) SUMMARY:  A year after the implementation of </p><p>Honduras\' new Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), opinions </p><p>regarding its level of success are positive overall, but </p><p>critics remain.  Supporters cite the commencement of oral </p><p>trials under the new system in 2002 as evidence of the </p><p>Code\'s success.  Critics, however, contend that the changes </p><p>have not done enough to eliminate corruption in the judicial </p><p>system and that the new Code is already in need of reform. </p><p>The current independent Supreme Court, which represents </p><p>another separate milestone in Honduran judicial reform, has </p><p>strongly embraced the Code.  Post is optimistic about the </p><p>potential long-term benefits of the new Criminal Procedure </p><p>Code.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Until February 2002, the Honduran justice system </p><p>operated under a criminal procedure code that was still </p><p>based in part upon Spanish colonial law.  It did not provide </p><p>for oral trials; cases were resolved based on written </p><p>submissions.  The system was slow, subject to corruption, </p><p>and not transparent.  In the mid-1990\'s, the United States </p><p>first began supporting efforts to create a new CPC.  Since </p><p>1997, the U.S. has contributed approximately USD 12.5 </p><p>million for judicial reform in Honduras, with a particular </p><p>focus on the CPC.  On December 30, 1999, due in large part </p><p>to U.S. policy initiatives, the Honduran Congress approved a </p><p>new Criminal Procedure Code.  The new code came into full </p><p>effect on February 20, 2002.  It introduced wholesale change </p><p>into the criminal justice system, including oral trials, an </p><p>adversarial trial process, increased protections for </p><p>defendants, and overall changes intended to facilitate the </p><p>growth of a more transparent and effective system.  The CPC </p><p>also introduced a strong prosecutorial function similar to </p><p>that of the United States, whereby the prosecutor has </p><p>significant discretion in terms of moving a case forward. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) According to the Honduran Interinstitutional Criminal </p><p>Justice Commission (CIJP), since the implementation of the </p><p>new Code, there have been 3,341 preliminary hearings, 3,989 </p><p>initial hearings, and 1,184 pleadings.  The majority of </p><p>trials have involved prosecution of crimes such as homicide, </p><p>rape, drug possession, and drug trafficking.  Of the limited </p><p>cases processed thus far, approximately 6.6 percent have </p><p>resulted in convictions and 9.4 percent have resulted in </p><p>acquittals. Thirty-eight percent of cases have been resolved </p><p>through plea bargaining and 45 percent were dismissed due to </p><p>lack of evidence or technical reasons.  In cases of drug </p><p>trafficking and financial fraud, there is a much higher </p><p>conviction rate (52 percent), with 28 percent of cases </p><p>resulting in acquittal and just 20 percent dismissed. </p><p>Resolved cases have been processed with far greater </p><p>efficiency under the CPC, in contrast to the former system </p><p>in which cases languished for years. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Despite these advances, there are many challenges </p><p>that the judicial system has yet to overcome.  Foremost </p><p>among these, according to the CIJP, is the attitude of </p><p>judicial officials.  While the Code calls for impartial </p><p>public judgment, the often secretive attitude of the older, </p><p>written system sometimes prevails.  Second, effective </p><p>investigation of crimes is an ongoing problem.  Poor </p><p>coordination with police on investigations means few cases </p><p>requiring significant investigation are ever brought to </p><p>court.  As listed above, 45 percent of all cases since the </p><p>inception of the CPC have been dismissed (not all because of </p><p>poor investigations, but many have been).  Most prosecutions </p><p>are based on cases in which the accused is caught in the act </p><p>or which are resolved within 24 hours of the crime.  Lack of </p><p>sufficient forensic medicine resources or lack of discretion </p><p>in using those resources, including a morgue that is still </p><p>housed in a tiny post-Hurricane Mitch "temporary" facility, </p><p>also contribute to a continually low case closure rate.  A </p><p>third challenge facing the new Code lies in the opposition </p><p>to some of its policies, particularly those that allow the </p><p>release of suspects before trial.  Advocates for the </p><p>revision of the new Code, including the Minister of Public </p><p>Security and other law enforcement officials, appear to be </p><p>gaining momentum. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Supreme Court also faces challenges in the </p><p>Congress and in the media.  Perhaps due to its increased </p><p>status and greater independence, the Supreme Court came </p><p>under attack this year from the Congress.  In August 2002, </p><p>in an apparent attempt to undermine the power of the </p><p>judiciary, the Congress approved a constitutional amendment </p><p>appropriating to itself the power to interpret the </p><p>Constitution.  A legal challenge to this move is pending </p><p>with the Supreme Court (reftel) and the amendment must still </p><p>be ratified before it becomes law.  As the judiciary </p><p>increases in strength and independence, similar attacks from </p><p>the legislative and executive powers should be expected.  In </p><p>another highly publicized controversy, Vilma Morales, </p><p>President of the Supreme Court and a Nationalist Party </p><p>nominee, has been criticized for supposedly partisan </p><p>dismissal of Liberal judges. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT:  Post foresees many challenges ahead for </p><p>the CPC.  It is clear that there must be constant vigilance </p><p>against corruption if the justice system is to effectively </p><p>utilize the new CPC to the benefit of the population. </p><p>Public confidence in the system is also vital if the CPC is </p><p>to be a success.  Both the controversy over the partisan </p><p>dismissal of judges and legislative challenges to judicial </p><p>power, combined with reports of pervasive corruption, will </p><p>continue to undermine public confidence in the judicial </p><p>system and, by proxy, the new Code.  However, Post is </p><p>pleased with the progress the courts have made in </p><p>implementing the CPC thus far.  The Ambassador and all </p><p>elements of the mission have strong relations with the </p><p>Supreme Court and other judicial system actors.  USAID </p><p>support for the CPC is ongoing, despite limited funds. </p><p>Because Honduras is a high-crime country, Post believes that </p><p>a more efficient criminal justice system that provides for </p><p>fair process is critical to efforts to increase citizen </p><p>security.  If the CPC is successful in improving public </p><p>perceptions of justice and law enforcement, the CPC may also </p><p>play a role in the reduction of the high rate of </p><p>extrajudicial killings in Honduras.  Moreover, since the </p><p>current security situation dissuades investors, a more </p><p>secure environment will lower the risk to investors and may </p><p>ultimately help to attract much-needed foreign capital.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
