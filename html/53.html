<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CAIRO 09867 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, SOCI, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISLAMIC SHARIA DEBATE--WORDS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER </p><p>STALL </p><p> </p><p>REF:  CAIRO 6360 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2.  BEGIN SUMMARY.  THE MAY DEBATE IN THE PEOPLES </p><p>ASSEMBLY ON ISLAMIC SHARIA WILL PRODUCE NO IMMEDIATE </p><p>RESULTS, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL SOURCES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE OPPOSITION.  IT IS LIKELY TO LAUNCH A </p><p>REVIEW PROCESS LASTING SEVERAL YEARS TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>EXISTING LEGISLATION IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA.  THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE OPPOSITION NEW WAFD PARTY AND OF THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ARE ON BOARD ABOUT THIS PROCESS, </p><p>AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF POSSIBLE TACIT COMPROMISES </p><p>BETWEEN THE GOVERNING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (NDP) </p><p>AND WAFD ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF SHARIA ISSUES. </p><p>ALTHOUGH MAJOR POLITICAL FORCES HAVE APPARENTLY </p><p>ESTABLISHED A "DETENTE" OVER SHARIA, HOWEVER, ISLAMIC </p><p>DEMAGOGUERY AND VIOLENCE BY UNDERGROUND ISLAMIC </p><p>EXTREMISTS ARE DANGERS THAT WILL PERSIST EVEN AS THE </p><p>SHARIA PROCESS ROLLS FORWARD IN THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC </p><p>CONDITIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>3.  SINCE OUR RECENT REPORT ON THE COMING PEOPLES </p><p>ASSEMBLY DEBATE OF ISLAMIC SHARIA (KORANIC LAW) IN MAY </p><p>(SEE REF A), IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT THIS DEBATE WILL </p><p>PRODUCE NO IMMEDIATE RESULTS.  ACCORDING TO A RANGE OF </p><p>WELL-PLACED SOURCES, THE ASSEMBLY DISCUSSIONS WILL LEAD </p><p>TO A LAW-BY-LAW REVIEW OF EXISTING LEGISLATION TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT EACH AND EVERY LAW IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA </p><p>PROVISIONS.  THIS PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO TAKE AT LEAST </p><p>SEVERAL YEARS.  LEADING ELEMENTS OF THE NEW WAFD PARTY, </p><p>AND OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD NOW ALLIED TO IT, HAVE </p><p>CONFIRMED PRIVATELY TO US THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND </p><p>ACCEPTANCE OF THIS DELIBERATE PROCESS.  THEIR AGREEMENT, </p><p>ADDED TO THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY\'S DOMINATION IN </p><p>THE ASSEMBLY, ROBS THE COMING DEBATE OF SOME OF ITS </p><p>DRAMA AND DECREASES THE CHANGES OF NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.   THIS SCENARIO REFLECTS THE TACTICS OF PRESIDENT </p><p>MUBARAK, ABLY SUPPORTED BY HIS SPEAKER OF THE PEOPLES </p><p>ASSEMBLY, RIFAAT EL MAHGOUB; THEY ARE WILLING TO LET </p><p>ISLAMIC SENTIMENT BE EXPRESSED FREELY, BUT NOT TO THE </p><p>POINT OF THREATENING THE POLITICAL STATUS QUO.  GOVERN- </p><p>MENT AND NDP CIRCLES HAVE BEEN SPREADING THE WORD QUIETLY </p><p>BUT FIRMLY THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NO INTENTION OF LETTING </p><p>THE SHARIA ISSUE GET OUT OF CONTROL.  COMMENTING IN A </p><p>PRESS INTERVIEW ON A DEMAND BY GAD AL-HAQ, THE GRAND </p><p>SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR (WHO OCCUPIES THE MOST PROMINENT </p><p>ISLAMIC POST IN EGYPT), FOR THE APPLICATION OF ISLAMIC </p><p>SHARIA, MUBARAK STATED THAT EGYPTIAN LAWS "DO NOT CONFLICT </p><p>IN ANY WAY WITH THE ISLAMIC RELIGION AND ARE 99 PERCENT </p><p>IN ACCORDANCE WITH ISLAMIC SHARIA."  MUBARAK DID NOT GET </p><p>INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THE REMAINING "ONE PERCENT," OR THE </p><p>EXTENT OF CHANGES IN LAWS REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AS </p><p>BANKING PRACTICES OR ISLAMIC PUNISHMENTS.  (WE HEAR FROM </p><p>OTHER SOURCES THAT "TINKERING" WITH EGYPTIAN LEGISLATION </p><p>WILL FOCUS IN THE BANKING AREA, WITH THE SUBSTITUTION </p><p>OF "FEES" AND "SHARED OWNERSHIP" FOR INTEREST; ISLAMIC </p><p>PUNISHMENTS ARE SAID TO BE OUT OF THE QUESTION.) </p><p>MUBARAK\'S POINT, OF COURSE, IS THAT NOTHING MUCH NEEDS </p><p>TO BE ALTERED. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  THIS VIEWPOINT IS DRAMATICALLY OPPOSED TO THAT OF </p><p>SHARIA PROPONENTS, WHO WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO </p><p>THROW OUT THE ENTIRE EGYPTIAN LEGAL SYSTEM--WITH ALL OF </p><p>ITS FOREIGN ACCRETIONS--AND REPLACE IT WITH "THE FULL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF ISLAMIC SHARIA."  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>ORIGINATOR OF THIS "99 PERCENT" REASONING, STATE SECURITY </p><p>COURT CHIEF JUSTICE SAID AL-ASHMAWY, MUBARAK\'S ADOPTION </p><p>OF HIS STAND SHOWS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY </p><p>DETERMINED NOT TO ALLOW "THE SHEIKHS" TO GAIN CONTROL OF </p><p>EGYPTIAN LAW. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  AL-ASHMAWY ALSO TOLD US THAT HIS ARGUMENTS AGAINST </p><p>"FULL SHARIA" HAVE RECENTLY WON SUPPORT IN THE WAFD PARTY </p><p>AS IT PREPARES FOR THE ASSEMBLY DEBATE.  HE MENTIONED </p><p>THE NAMES OF MUMTAZ NASSAR AND WAHEED RAAFAT, TWO SENIOR </p><p>PARTY FIGURES AND BOTH LEGAL EXPERTS, SUGGESTING AN </p><p>INFORMAL UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE DELIBERATE PACE OF VERY </p><p>LIMITED LEGAL CHANGE.  MUMTAZ NASSAR, WAFD LEADER IN THE </p><p>PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, RECENTLY TOLD US HIMSELF THAT THE WAFD </p><p>AGREES WITH THE LENGTHY TIMETABLE FOR SHARIA REVIEW. </p><p>PRAISING PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S "DEMOCRATIC" APPROACH </p><p>(COMPARED TO THAT OF SADAT AND NASSER),  NASSAR IMPLIED </p><p>THAT ACCEPTABLE  COMPROMISES BETWEEN THE WAFD AND THE </p><p>NDP ARE ALREADY IN SIGHT OVER THE QUESTION OF THE BANKING </p><p>SYSTEM AND ISLAMIC SHARIA. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.  COMMENT.  WE SENSE A CERTAIN SATISFACTION IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND SECULAR POLITICAL CIRCLES OVER PROSPECTIVE </p><p>SUCCESS IN CONTAINING THE SHARIA DEBATE, WITH THE WAFD </p><p>AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD LEADERSHIP EVIDENTLY ON BOARD. </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY.  HAVING A KIND </p><p>OF  DETENTE BETWEEN THE MAJOR LICENSED POLITICAL ORGANI- </p><p>ZATIONS DOES NOT RULE OUT ISLAMIC DEMAGOGUERY OR VIOLENCE </p><p>INSTIGATED BY EXTREMIST ISLAMIC GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  ADDED COMMENT.  SHARIA PROPONENTS HAVE BEEN THROUGH </p><p>THIS BEFORE.  SADAT\'S RESPONSE TO THEIR DEMANDS WAS TO </p><p>ESTABLISH COMMITTEES AND LET THEM DRAFT LAWS, A PROCESS </p><p>WHICH LASTED FIVE YEARS AND ENDED WITH NO LEGISLATION </p><p>BEING PASSED.  NOW, IT SEEMS WE ARE TO SEE A REVERSE </p><p>PROCESS:  MORE COMMITTEES TO STUDY EXISTING LAWS AND </p><p>AGAIN, LITTLE REAL CHANGE IN THE LEGAL STATUS QUO.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT CAN BE EXPECTED TO MAKE THE MOST OF MARGINAL </p><p>ISLAMIC IMPROVEMENTS TO CURRENT LAW, SO AS TO PREVENT </p><p>THE SHARIA ISSUE FROM STRIKING AN ISLAMIC SPARK AMONG </p><p>THE MUSLIM MASSES.  THIS MAY MEAN A POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE </p><p>AND LEGAL STRUCTURE WITH MARGINALLY MORE ISLAMIC COLORA- </p><p>TION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VELIOTES </p><p></p></div>
