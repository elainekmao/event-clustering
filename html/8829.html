SUMMARY: Op/ed by Ambassador Jones on the Middle East </p><p>Roadmap receives fulsome coverage in today\'s print media, </p><p>including four Arabic and two English newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>Charges of corruption and governmental malfeasance dominate </p><p>all Arabic dailies over the past week as the country </p><p>prepares for July 5 parliamentary elections.  Indignation </p><p>against the government for preferring charges against a </p><p>Kuwaiti editor for slandering the ruling family continues </p><p>apace, with liberal Kuwait University professor Ahmed al- </p><p>Baghdadi--himself once imprisoned for lese majeste--penning </p><p>a harsh attack on the Minister of Information for allegedly </p><p>asserting that the ruling family of Kuwait "gave" the </p><p>country democracy. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  HEADLINES: </p><p> </p><p>--All newspapers (6/16):  De facto Prime Minister and </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed, called </p><p>for combating wasta (influence) in the government body and </p><p>said that:  "for every wasta, someone\'s right goes to </p><p>waste." </p><p> </p><p>--All newspapers (6/16):  Cabinet discussed corruption </p><p>issues and the freezing of recent decision undertaken by </p><p>elected Ministers who will be running for elections. </p><p> </p><p>--All newspapers (6/16):  National Assembly Speaker, Jassim </p><p>Al-Khorafi, also a candidate for parliamentary elections </p><p>called on the ruling family to settle any issues they have </p><p>through decisive decisions.  Al-Khorafi argued that the </p><p>National Assembly was beginning to lose its credibility with </p><p>Kuwaiti citizens. </p><p> </p><p>--Al-Watan (6/14):  Journalists without Borders sent a </p><p>letter to Minister of Information, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahd, </p><p>expressing concern for referring Editor-in-Chief of Arabic </p><p>daily Al-Watan, Mohammed Al-Jassim, to the Public </p><p>Prosecutor.   (Front page) </p><p> </p><p>--Al-Qabas (6/14):  conducted a poll among 800 Kuwaitis </p><p>whereby 85% said they think that corruption in Kuwait is </p><p>"extremely serious" or "serious". </p><p> </p><p>--All newspapers (6/18):  the Kuwaiti Journalists </p><p>Association called on Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed to withdraw the </p><p>government\'s claim against the editor-in-chief of Al-Watan </p><p>newspaper who was recently referred to the Public Prosecutor </p><p>and charged with contesting the Amir\'s authorities.  The </p><p>association argued that the decision reflects negatively on </p><p>Kuwait\'s democratic image, especially during the elections </p><p>time. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Liberal Saud Al-Samaka wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(6/18):  Influence (wasta) has reached the core the core of </p><p>this society and has contaminated it with corruption.. </p><p>Influence has deprived our youths of the spirit of </p><p>initiation and national loyalty.  It has also shed a </p><p>negative light on society to the extent that our country is </p><p>now being characterized as anarchic and as a society of </p><p>thieves and bribes.." </p><p> </p><p>4.  Liberal Nabeel Al-Fadl wrote in independent Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam (6/18):  "We must agree that funding election campaigns </p><p>is a legitimate right and a proper application of the </p><p>democratic process.  The President of the United States has </p><p>earned his elected office through funding by various groups </p><p>that saw him as their best representative.  This is the same </p><p>for all members of the Congress and the Senate..  Therefore, </p><p>funding election campaigns is a legitimate, democratic </p><p>process in principle.  Yet, what is forbidden is using </p><p>public funds or charity donations to fund these campaigns. </p><p>The money paid must come from private sources and donations </p><p>by those who see that the candidate represents their best </p><p>interests.  Even such donations must have a ceiling in order </p><p>not to exceed the real need of election campaigns and </p><p>therefore deviate from their proper cause and legitimate </p><p>path..  In order to achieve that, we must have transparency </p><p>and must announce the source of funding and the amount of </p><p>each donation in comparison with the actual expenses of the </p><p>campaign.  This process must also be monitored by a judicial </p><p>committer to monitor and audit." </p><p> </p><p>5.  Kuwait University professor, Hasan Abdulla Abbas, wrote </p><p>in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (6/16):  "We never expected the </p><p>government to accuse elected ministers of being deficient in </p><p>their duties and that corruption has dominated their </p><p>ministries due to election interests...  Unfortunately, </p><p>corruption has spread throughout the government body and </p><p>from the top to the bottom of the ministerial hierarchy.. </p><p>It is also disgusting to witness the class system in our </p><p>National Assembly.  Members of parliament are more biased </p><p>towards their blue blood, instead of defending principles </p><p>and the rights of citizens." </p><p> </p><p>6.  Parliament in Kuwait Lacks a Vision and Opposes Reform </p><p>Liberal political science professor, Dr. Shafeeq Al-Ghabra, </p><p>wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (6/16):  "Kuwait is </p><p>carrying heavy burdens that are hindering its development. </p><p>Its first burden is a parliament that lacks reform and where </p><p>many of its members do not believe in freedom of thought and </p><p>equality, not only between men and women, but also between </p><p>one human being and the other.  What is more dangerous is </p><p>that the nature of the election system (vote buying and lack </p><p>of laws that allow political parties) is in dire need for </p><p>reform." </p><p> </p><p>7.  Liberal Kuwait University Political Science professor, </p><p>Dr. Ahmed Al-Baghdadi, wrote in independent Al-Seyassa </p><p>(6/16):  "The Minister of Information is trying, through his </p><p>statements, to state that the democracy enjoyed by the </p><p>Kuwaiti people since 1963 was brought on by the ruling </p><p>family.  This is a flagrant canard that the ruling family </p><p>should not allow the young minister to foist onto the </p><p>Kuwaiti people..  It is not the right of the Minister of </p><p>Information or others to present democracy as if it had been </p><p>bestowed on us.  Unfortunately, the Kuwaiti people have lost </p><p>their courage in defending their constitutional rights.  In </p><p>reality, I am not astonished by the statements made by the </p><p>Minister of Information.  It seems that excessive contact </p><p>with the religious current leads to such thoughts, </p><p>especially impatience with democracy..  The Kuwaiti people </p><p>do not beg for their democracy from you Mr. Minister. </p><p>Instead, they derive it from the constitution that holds you </p><p>accountable.  Yet, if your statements are derived from your </p><p>capacity as a member of the ruling family, then know that </p><p>the constitution does not grant you this right, neither does </p><p>it grant it to others regardless of their power." </p><p></p></div>
