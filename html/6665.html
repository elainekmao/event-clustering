SUMMARY: Kuwaiti commentators complain that Arab world </p><p>media continue to be biased towards Kuwait, and ask </p><p>rhetorically why other Arabs do not decry Iraq\'s launching </p><p>of surface to surface missiles against Kuwait in recent </p><p>days. One commentator lauds Kuwaitis for their behavior on </p><p>the first night of the war writing, "Every single person was </p><p>at his or her post, unlike what happened in 1990." </p><p> </p><p>Photos of US and British medics treating injured Iraqi POWs </p><p>were featured prominently in all Kuwaiti newspapers. Kuwaiti </p><p>dailies report that the GOK will donate a total of USD 12 </p><p>million for aid to the Iraqi people. Kuwaiti cooperatives </p><p>(grocery stores) have begun to make gas masks available to </p><p>the general public, and all newspapers report huge crowds in </p><p>front of the Saudi Embassy seeking visas to leave Kuwait by </p><p>land (Note: Most Kuwaitis appear today to believe that the </p><p>threat from Iraq has receded.) End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. News stories: All newspapers prominently published </p><p>photos, some on the front pages, of US and British soldiers </p><p>offering medical treatment to Iraqi POWs. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassa and Al-Anba learned that Kuwaiti authorities </p><p>captured seven Iraqi soldiers on Kuwait\'s Warba Island after </p><p>their boat came under attack by coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report Ministry of Defense spokesman Col. </p><p>Yousef Al-Mulla\'s announcement that three Kuwaiti Patriot </p><p>missiles successfully destroyed an Iraqi SCUD missile </p><p>launched towards Kuwait on March 21. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report that Kuwait\'s Permanent Representative </p><p>to the UN Mission in Geneva, Ambassador Darrar Al-Rozouqi, </p><p>announced that Kuwait will donate USD 2 million to UNHCR to </p><p>aid Iraqi refugees. Al-Seyassa daily also reports that the </p><p>Director of the Humanitarian Aid Center, retired General Ali </p><p>Al-Moumen, said that Kuwait will be sending USD 10 million </p><p>in installments to aid the Iraqi people. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report that the Ports Authority of the </p><p>Ministry of Interior announced that expatriates in Kuwait </p><p>without a valid visa will be allowed to leave without paying </p><p>a fine. </p><p> </p><p>Thousands of expatriates queued in front of the Saudi </p><p>Embassy yesterday for visas to transit by land through Saudi </p><p>Arabia to their home countries, all newspapers report. </p><p> </p><p>Secretary-General of the Kuwait Journalist Association, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Faisal Al-Qanaie, in comments published in Al-Rai Al-Aam and </p><p>Al-Qabas, questioned why there were no demonstrations in any </p><p>Arab country denouncing Iraqi missile attacks on Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>Arab League Secretary-General, Amr Moussa, described Iraq\'s </p><p>missile attacks against Kuwait as a "negative development," </p><p>and stressed that the Arab league does not approve of these </p><p>attacks, Al-Qabas and Al-Watan report. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report that cooperatives (grocery stores) in </p><p>Manusira and Abdulla Al-Salem areas of Kuwait City announced </p><p>they will be selling one thousand gas masks to Kuwaiti </p><p>citizens residing in the two areas; other cooperatives are </p><p>also making plans to sell gas masks. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials </p><p> </p><p>3.  "The First Day of War" </p><p>MP Ahmad Al-Rubei wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/22):  "We </p><p>should be proud of how the first day of the war went </p><p>domestically. Every single person was at his or her post, </p><p>unlike what happened in 1990 when we were invaded by Iraq. </p><p>We lived with the sounds of [air raid] sirens on the first </p><p>day of the war, and we succeeded in dealing with them. This </p><p>current war is an opportunity to regain the trust in our </p><p>government, our military institutions and ourselves." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Kuwait and the Media War" </p><p>MP Abdelmohsen Jamal wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/22): </p><p>"At this time of war, we need a distinctive media plan. to </p><p>focus on the Iraqi missile aggressions against Kuwait, and </p><p>to realize that the Iraqi regime will not hesitate to </p><p>threaten Kuwait in any possible way. We have to inform the </p><p>world that the Iraqi media is lying by denying such attacks </p><p>against Kuwait. Our official media must be transparent and </p><p>balanced in order to win this media war." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The Media of Defeat" </p><p>Dr. Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/22): </p><p>"As was expected, the allied forces led by the US were able </p><p>to occupy a big part of Iraq without resistance.  but we </p><p>were astonished at how some media were not objective in </p><p>presenting facts and figures. It was very obvious that the </p><p>Arab media were siding with Iraq-- which is normal because </p><p>they reject any aggression on any Arab country-- but to </p><p>broadcast lies denying what other foreign media were </p><p>reporting is not acceptable. The Arab satellite channels </p><p>were not subjective in their analysis and they used </p><p>sentimental language in their reporting. Therefore, the </p><p>foreign media reporting was more truthful, realistic and </p><p>more credible because they broadcast facts as they happen." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Fall of Basra: How and When" </p><p>Abdelrahman Al-Ajmi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/22): </p><p>"America and Britain will be in an embarrassing situation if </p><p>Basra does not fall quickly into the hands of their forces </p><p>this week. This situation will result in putting both </p><p>countries under international pressure. It is also certain </p><p>that the American and British forces are concerned about </p><p>minimizing their loses and about the safety of the Iraqi </p><p>people also." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "A War On the Dark World" </p><p>Abdelamir Al-Torki wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/22): </p><p>"The war is not against Iraq. It is a war against the dark </p><p>world, which failed to establish justice, democracy and </p><p>freedom. The war is against Saddam Hussein, the biggest </p><p>tyrant and oppressor. The war is against the Arab regimes </p><p>that are living, in the dark ages. The war on Saddam is a </p><p>war against the world, which rejects globalization and the </p><p>establishment of a new world system. We thank God that the </p><p>war on Saddam has been initiated from Kuwait to put an end </p><p>to Arab dark regimes." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
