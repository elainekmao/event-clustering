<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 08873 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP EXCLUSIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, NL </p><p>SUBJECT:  ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 371962, (B) STATE 371963, </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  EMBASSY HAS DISCUSSED ISSUE OF ABU NIDAL </p><p>TERRORISM (REFTELS) WITH APPROPRIATE MFA OFFICIALS. </p><p>THE INITIAL MFA RESPONSE INDICATED THE DUTCH RECOGNIZE </p><p>THE DANGER OF ABU NIDAL GROUP AND ARE PREPARED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN A "POLITICAL DIALOGUE" WITH THE US AND </p><p>OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO CONSIDER POSSIBLE JOINT </p><p>ACTION.  NONETHELESS, THERE IS NO CLEAR IDEA WITHIN THE </p><p>MINISTRY AS TO HOW SUCH A DIALOGUE MIGHT BE STRUCTURED </p><p>AND WHAT CHANNELS OF COORDINATION WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. </p><p>THE DUTCH ALSO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF OUR DEMARCHE TO PASS </p><p>ON INFORMATION CONCERNING A POSSIBLE AMAL TERRORIST </p><p>ACTION WHICH THE MFA RECEIVED CONFIDENTIALLY FROM TWO </p><p>LIBYAN GOVERNMENT SOURCES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMBASSADOR RAISED ISSUE OF ABU NIDAL TERRORISM </p><p>(REFTELS) WITH MFA DIRECTOR FOR MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA </p><p>AFFAIRS JAN HORAK AND EMBASSY OFFICER FOLLOWED UP IN </p><p>GREATER DETAIL WITH AREND HUITZING, HEAD, MFA MIDDLE </p><p>EAST OFFICE, AND JOOP VAN BOSSE, HEAD, NORTH AFRICA </p><p>OFFICE.  WE EXPLAINED USG INTEREST IN INCREASED INTER- </p><p>NATIONAL COOPERATION AGAINST ABU NIDAL, DRAWING ON </p><p>POINTS REF A, AND PROVIDED MFA WITH US INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ASSESSMENT ON THE SUBJECT (REF B).  WE ARE ALSO </p><p>PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT TO DUTCH INTELLIGENCE </p><p>AGENCIES VIA SIRO LIAISON CHANNELS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  HUITZING AND VAN BOSSE INDICATED THAT GON IS CON- </p><p>CERNED ABOUT ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION, WHICH WAS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR BOMBING OF AN EL AL OFFICE IN </p><p>AMSTERDAM IN SEPTEMBER.  HUITZING NOTED THAT </p><p>NETHERLANDS AND US ARE ALREADY EXCHANGING INFORMATION </p><p>ON TERRORISM THROUGH APPROPRIATE CHANNELS AND HE DOUBTS </p><p>THERE WAS MUCH NEW THE DUTCH COULD OFFER IN THIS AREA. </p><p>HE DID THINK, HOWEVER, THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR A </p><p>"POLITICAL DIALOGUE" BETWEEN THE US AND CONCERNED </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO SEE WHAT CONCRETE DIPLOMATICC </p><p>SECURITY MEASURES WE COULD JOINTLY TAKE TO DEAL WITH THE </p><p>ABU NIDAL THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE ASKED HUITZING AND VAN BOSSE IF THEY HAD ANY </p><p>SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE BEST FORUM FOR SUCH A DIALOGUE. </p><p>THE TWO MEN DISAGREED IN THEIR RESPONSES.  HUITZING </p><p>FAVORED DEALING WITH THE ISSUE AT NATO, WHILE </p><p>VAN BOSSE THOUGHT A US DIALOGUE WITH THE EC "TREVI" </p><p>GROUP DEALING WITH TERRORISM MIGHT BE BETTER. </p><p>HUITZING\'S PREFERENCE FOR NATO SEEMED BASED ON HIS </p><p>DESIRE TO GIVE PREEMINENCE TO THE POLITICAL/ </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ASPECTS OF SUCH A DIALOGUE, WHILE VAN BOSSE </p><p>FELT THE TREVI GROUP COULD BETTER DEAL WITH THE LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT SIDE OF THE TERRORISM ISSUE.  BOTH MEN </p><p>AGREED THE MFA LACKS A CLEAR POINT OF CONTACT FOR </p><p>COORDINATING TERRORISM POLICY COMPARABLE TO THE </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT\'S M/CT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WE ALSO ASKED VAN BOSSE ABOUT INFORMATION PROVIDED </p><p>TO US  THAT A NUMBER OF DUTCH TRAVELING TO </p><p>LIBYA HAD TWO PASSPORTS, ONE OF WHICH WAS OFTEN </p><p>SEIZED BY LIBYAN AUTHORITIES.  VAN BOSSE CLARIFIED </p><p>THAT SUCH SEIZURES USUALLY ONLY OCCUR WHEN THE </p><p>LIBYANS HAVE AN UNRESOLVED COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL </p><p>CLAIM AGAINST THE DUTCH CITIZEN IN QUESTION.  THE </p><p>PASSPORTS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS RETURNED </p><p>EVENTUALLY BY THE LIBYANS, VAN BOSSE SAID, AND THERE </p><p>IS NO EVIDENCE THEY HAVE BEEN USED TO FACILITATE </p><p>ILLEGAL TRAVEL BY TERRORISTS.  HUITZING NOTED THAT </p><p>IT WOULD BE FAR EASIER FOR THE LIBYANS TO OBTAIN </p><p>DUTCH PASSPORTS ON THE "BLACK MARKET" FROM AMONG </p><p>PASSPORTS REPORTED LOST OR STOLEN WITHIN THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS THAN TO ATTEMPT TO USE ONE OF THE FEW </p><p>SEIZED DIRECTLY BY THEIR AUTHORITIES, SINCE THE </p><p>DUTCH KEEP A CLOSE WATCH ON THOSE PASSPORTS AND </p><p>WOULD BE AWARE IMMEDIATELY OF LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IF THEY SHOWED UP IN THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  VAN BOSSE ALSO USED THE OPPORTUNITY OF OUR </p><p>DEMARCHE TO PASS TO US INFORMATION RECEIVED IN CONFI- </p><p>DENCE FROM TWO DIFFERENT LIBYAN DIPLOMATS REGARDING </p><p>POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  VAN BOSSE SAID THE </p><p>DUTCH EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI HAD BEEN TOLD IN JULY THAT </p><p>THE AMAL GROUP IN LEBANON WAS PLANNING A POSSIBLE AIR </p><p>HIJACKING OF A DUTCH AND/OR LIBYAN AIRCRAFT.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE LIBYAN SOURCES, THE TERRORISTS WOULD BE USING </p><p>FORGED LEBANESE OR LIBYAN PASSPORTS.  VAN BOSSE </p><p>ADMITTED THE INFORMATION WAS RATHER DATED, BUT HE </p><p>PRESENTED IT TO US TO UNDERSCORE THE DUTCH MFA ARGUMENT </p><p>THAT MAINTAINING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH LIBYA CAN </p><p>OCCASIONALLY YIELD VALUABLE INFORMATION OF USE TO THE </p><p>WEST\'S EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  VAN BOSSE AND HUITZING CONCLUDED BY SAYING THEY </p><p>WOULD BRING OUR DEMARCHE ON ABU NIDAL TO THE ATTENTION </p><p>OF SENIOR MFA OFFICIALS AND WOULD BE IN TOUCH WITH US IF </p><p>THE MINISTRY HAD ANY ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS ON POSSIBLE </p><p>FUTURE COOPERATION IN THIS AREA. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT: VAN BOSSE\'S AND HUITZING\'S READY </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THE VALUE OF A STEPPED-UP WESTERN </p><p>POLITICAL DIALOGUE ON TERRORISM IS ENCOURAGING. </p><p>WE WILL BE FOLLOWING UP TO FOMENT  SIMILAR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING AT SENIOR MFA LEVELS.  EVEN WITH SUCH </p><p>UNDERSTANDING, HOWEVER, IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO </p><p>TURN WESTERN DIALOGUE INTO OUR OBJECTIVE OF JOINT </p><p>OR PARALLEL PRESSURES BY THE DUTCH UPON LIBYA AND </p><p>SYRIA.  WHAT WE NEED AS A FIRST STEP IS TO IDENTIFY </p><p>A WESTERN FORUM FOR DIALOGUE WHERE WE COULD BUILD </p><p>MOMENTUM FOR JOINT ACTION IN WHICH WE COULD CATCH </p><p>UP THE DUTCH AND OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BREMER </p><p></p></div>
