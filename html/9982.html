<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 005002 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR ERRION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ETRD, TU, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA READOUT OF SYRIAN P.M. MIRO\'S VISIT TO </p><p>ANKARA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by A/DCM Scot Marciel. Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) In a readout of Syrian P.M. Miro\'s July 29-30 visit </p><p>to Ankara, MFA Acting Head of Department for the Middle East </p><p>Kemal Tuzun told us Miro\'s visit was significant as the first </p><p>visit of a Syrian P.M. in 17 years.  As a result of the </p><p>visit, Tuzun said, Turkey has invited Syrian President Assad </p><p>to visit Ankara in the "near future -- perhaps by the end of </p><p>the year."  The Syrians have not yet responded to the Turkish </p><p>invitation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Economic Agreements </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Tuzun claimed discussions focused on further </p><p>developing bilateral economic ties, since Miro\'s portfolio is </p><p>primarily an economic one.  Miro\'s delegation, which included </p><p>several Syrian cabinet ministers, signed agreements with the </p><p>Turks on four economic and trade-related issues: 1) the </p><p>formation of a Joint Economic Council; 2) health services; 3) </p><p>greater customs/border cooperation; and 4) mining, petroleum </p><p>and other energy related projects.  The two sides agreed to </p><p>work on technical agreements regarding double taxation and </p><p>encouraging investment, which suffered as a result of </p><p>bilateral tensions during the 1990s, when Syria actively </p><p>supported the PKK.  State Minister for Trade Kursad Tuzmen </p><p>told the press that Turkey was interested in pursuing a free </p><p>trade agreement with Syria, but Foreign Trade officials </p><p>acknowledged privately that Turkey\'s Customs Union agreement </p><p>with the EU would make an FTA difficult if not impossible. </p><p>(Note: The officials said bilateral trade totaled only $762 </p><p>million in 2002. End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Middle East Peace and Iraq </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On Middle East peace and Iraq, Miro offered "nothing </p><p>new," according to Tuzun.  Miro used the "standard Syrian </p><p>talking points," saying Syria will not be an obstacle to the </p><p>Road Map and claiming that "peace is now a strategic </p><p>objective" for the Syrian government.  Tuzun asserted that </p><p>the Turks encouraged the Syrians to participate more actively </p><p>in building peace and urged that Syria should use its </p><p>influence to push Lebanon to do more to promote peace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Offering a different take on Miro\'s approach, MFA DG </p><p>for the Middle East Burcuoglu claimed to Charge that Syria\'s </p><p>position on Israel-Palestine issue has "radicalized" of late, </p><p>e.g., the Syrians\' statement that that Jerusalem should be </p><p>the capital of a Palestinian state and Syria\'s support for </p><p>the right of return for all Palestinian refugees. </p><p>5. (C) While Burcuoglu indicated to Charge that the Syrians </p><p>could be a stumbling block to Arab League efforts to work </p><p>with the Iraqi Governing Council, Tuzun described Miro\'s </p><p>statements on Iraq as the "typical Syrian approach."  Miro </p><p>merely underscored what Syria has said before, Tuzun </p><p>explained, namely that: a) Iraq must determine its own </p><p>future; b) the entire region should work toward peace in </p><p>Iraq; c) foreign militaries must leave Iraq at the earliest </p><p>opportunity; and d) Turkey can play an important role. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
