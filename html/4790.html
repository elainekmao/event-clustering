<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002835 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S AND AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EFIN, ETRD, AMGT, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Harare\'s Fuel Lines: It\'s Not Pretty </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 2809 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: An informal poll of Embassy staff today </p><p>indicates that it remains very difficult to obtain fuel </p><p>in Harare. Nonetheless, several stations are pumping and </p><p>vehicles on the road have increased from approximately 25 </p><p>to 50 percent of normal. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Local staff say it has taken from 2-24 hours in line </p><p>to purchase fuel over the past few days.  Many leave cars </p><p>unattended in gas lines and pay local "touts" to contact </p><p>them when the precious stuff arrives.  There are reports </p><p>of frustratingly-long unfruitful stints.  Here\'s what a </p><p>few local employees told us today: </p><p> </p><p>"This morning I had to pass through one of the few </p><p>service stations which had the precious liquid to give a </p><p>friend some food. He slept there last night having joined </p><p>the queue at about 3:00 pm yesterday.  When I saw him at </p><p>seven in the morning he had been in that one place for </p><p>sixteen hours. For the whole time there was no fuel. It </p><p>was expected at about eight o\'clock this morning.  The </p><p>fuel station as is expected, is owned by a member of the </p><p>ruling regime." </p><p> </p><p>"Last Sunday I waited for 5 hours at a service station </p><p>but got nothing.  A lot of people are waiting for under </p><p>two hours and getting nothing." </p><p> </p><p>"Some of my colleagues have had to spend the whole night </p><p>at these queues hoping that fuel will be delivered the </p><p>next day.  On average one would need to spend 12 to 18 </p><p>hours queuing for the precious liquid." </p><p> </p><p>"I have been looking for diesel since Saturday last week. </p><p>I spent 3 hours on Saturday and the product ran out two </p><p>cars before I could be served.  On Sunday, I spent 2 </p><p>hours at [one station] and another 3 hours at [another </p><p>station] and again diesel ran out before I could be </p><p>served. The same story happened on Tuesday and Wednesday </p><p>night after work." </p><p> </p><p>Note: The Embassy sells fuel to employees, but at about </p><p>10-fold the local subsidized price.  For that reason, </p><p>many employees still try to procure it on the economy. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>3. It seems every Zimbabwean motorist has a fresh battle </p><p>story to tell.  Parastatal NOCZIM is importing fuel but </p><p>unable to satisfy the heavy pent-up demand.  Black-market </p><p>transactions are becoming more common, public transport </p><p>is sketchy and taxis have begun to charge about 5-times </p><p>the normal fare.  We will continue to track this </p><p>important issue. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
