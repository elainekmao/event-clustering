<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 000308 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EAP/PIMBS </p><p>SINGAPORE FOR ARMA </p><p>CINCPAC ALSO FOR FPA - AMB. SALMON </p><p>NSC FOR ASIA DIRECTOR SANDRA KRISTOFF </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  4/25/16 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, BX </p><p>SUBJECT:  BRUNEI:  A FRIEND WORTH CULTIVATING </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR THERESA A. TULL. </p><p>REASONS:  1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  BRUNEI HAS PROVEN INCREASINGLY </p><p>OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT IT IS A FRIEND OF </p><p>THE UNITED STATES, GRATEFUL FOR OUR FORWARD </p><p>DEPLOYED PACIFIC PRESENCE, AND COOPERATIVE IN </p><p>OUR EFFORTS ON SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL ISSUES, </p><p>INCLUDING KEDO, BOSNIA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  FOR VERY LITTLE ADDITIONAL </p><p>INVESTMENT IN TIME AND FUNDS, THE UNITED STATES </p><p>COULD ENHANCE ITS BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>BRUNEI AND, I AM CONFIDENT, GENERATE EVEN MORE </p><p>COOPERATION FROM THIS OIL-RICH SULTANATE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AS I CONCLUDE MY TOUR IN BRUNEI, I RECOMMEND </p><p>(A) THAT THE PRESIDENT GIVE THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI </p><p>SOME "FACE" TIME, BEGINNING WITH SCHEDULING A </p><p>BILATERAL ON THE FRINGES OF THE MANILA APEC </p><p>LEADERS MEETING, AND POSSIBLY INCLUDING A </p><p>POST-ELECTION WASHINGTON INVITATION; (B) TO </p><p>FURTHER INCREASE BILATERAL INTERACTION, THAT THE </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT OFFER TO ESTABLISH A JOINT </p><p>COMMISSION WITH BRUNEI, AND THAT SENIOR USG </p><p>OFFICIALS FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT </p><p>VISIT BRUNEI OCCASIONALLY, AND THAT THEIR </p><p>BRUNEIAN COUNTERPARTS BE INVITED MORE OFTEN TO </p><p>THE UNITED STATES; AND (C) THAT A MINIMUM </p><p>INTERNATIONAL VISITOR GRANT AND FULBRIGHT </p><p>PROGRAM BE RETAINED FOR BRUNEI, DESPITE USIA </p><p>BUDGET CUTBACKS.  GIVEN THE SULTAN\'S </p><p>PREDISPOSITION TOWARDS A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH THE U.S., THIS MODEST EFFORT WOULD PAY </p><p>DIVIDENDS IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL COOPERATION, </p><p>INCLUDING FINANCIAL, ON BRUNEI\'S PART IN CAUSES </p><p>OF IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED STATES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. ECLIPSING GREAT BRITAIN AS IMPLICIT </p><p>GUARANTOR OF BRUNEIAN SECURITY </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  GREAT BRITAIN CONTINUES TO LOOM LARGE IN </p><p>BRUNEI, WITH THE RESIDUAL GURKHA PRESENCE, ITS </p><p>LOAN OFFICERS IN SERVICE WITH THE BRUNEIAN </p><p>MILITARY, AND THE TIES OF A CENTURY OF THE </p><p>BRITISH PROTECTORATE, REINFORCED BY BRUNEIAN </p><p>LINKS TO BRITISH UNIVERSITIES--AND ASSIDUOUS </p><p>CULTIVATION OF THE WEALTHY SULTAN BY BRITISH </p><p>ROYALTY.  BUT GREAT BRITAIN DOES NOT HAVE THE </p><p>SEVENTH FLEET, AND IS NOT VIEWED AS THE </p><p>STABILIZER OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, OR AS THE </p><p>BENIGN PROVIDER OF SECURITY IN THE UNCERTAIN </p><p>DAYS AHEAD AS CHINA DEVELOPS AS A SUPERPOWER AND </p><p>FLEXES ITS MUSCLES IN THE REGION.  INCREASINGLY </p><p>I SENSE THAT FOR BRUNEI, THE UNITED STATES IS </p><p>REGARDED AS THE ULTIMATE GUARANTOR OF ITS </p><p>SECURITY--NOT THAT BRUNEI NECESSARILY EXPECTS </p><p>THE U.S. TO COME TO THE RESCUE IF INVADED, BUT </p><p>IN THE SENSE THAT THE U.S. PRESENCE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE FORM OF THE SEVENTH FLEET, </p><p>WILL KEEP POTENTIALLY AGGRESSIVE REGIONAL POWERS </p><p>AT BAY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  BRUNEI\'S APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. PRESENCE </p><p>WAS HEIGHTENED BY CHINA\'S RECENT AGGRESSIVE </p><p>BEHAVIOR TOWARDS TAIWAN.  IN RECENT WEEKS </p><p>SEVERAL SENIOR BRUNEIAN OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>SULTAN, HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN TO ME ABOUT </p><p>CHINA\'S INTENTIONS, AND GRATITUDE FOR THE U.S. </p><p>RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>BRUNEI\'S COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. INCREASING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, BRUNEI HAS INCREASED </p><p>ITS COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN KEY AREAS. </p><p>FIRST, WE CONCLUDED A LONG-STALLED NEGOTIATION </p><p>AND IN NOVEMBER 1994 SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF </p><p>UNDERSTANDING ON DEFENSE COOPERATION, ON TERMS </p><p>FAVORABLE TO THE U.S. WITH REGARD TO CRIMINAL </p><p>PROCEEDINGS AGAINST POSSIBLE U.S. MILITARY </p><p>OFFENDERS--BETTER TERMS, I BELIEVE, THAN </p><p>SINGAPORE WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT.  DESPITE SOME </p><p>RESIDUAL BRUNEIAN NERVOUSNESS THAT THE TINY </p><p>COUNTRY NOT BE SEEN (BY ITS POTENTIALLY </p><p>AGGRESSIVE NORTHERN NEIGHBOR) AS TOO CLOSELY </p><p>LINKED WITH THE UNITED STATES, AT THE VERY TOP </p><p>LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT IT WAS DECIDED THAT A CLOSER </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BENIGN PROVIDER OF </p><p>SECURITY IN THE REGION, THE UNITED STATES, WAS </p><p>WORTH THE RISK OF AROUSING CONCERN IN CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  BRUNEI HAS ALSO MARKEDLY INCREASED ITS </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN.  THE </p><p>COUNTRY HAS RESPONDED GENEROUSLY TO OUR APPEALS </p><p>FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE KOREAN </p><p>PENINSULA ENERGY DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION </p><p>(KEDO), FOR AID TO THE PALESTINIANS IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS, </p><p>AND HAS SUPPORTED THE BOSNIAN MUSLIMS, MOST </p><p>RECENTLY WITH A US $8 MILLION DOLLAR PLEDGE FOR </p><p>REFUGEE RELIEF AT THE BRUSSELS CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN APEC AND IN ASEAN, BRUNEI HAS BEEN </p><p>GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. GOALS.  BRUNEI\'S </p><p>SKILLFUL DIPLOMACY IN THE CRITICAL INITIAL </p><p>STAGES HELPED SHAPE THE ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM IN </p><p>DIRECTIONS COMPATIBLE WITH U.S. AIMS FOR THIS </p><p>IMPORTANT FORUM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  BRUNEI HAS ALSO GIVEN U.S. BIDDERS VALUABLE </p><p>CONTRACTS IN RECENT MONTHS (SIKORSKY, BOEING </p><p>ARGOSYSTEMS, AIRWAYS ENGINEERING).  MCDONNELL </p><p>DOUGLAS AND RAYTHEON ARE COMPETING FOR SHIPBOARD </p><p>MISSILE SALES AND APPEAR TO HAVE A GOOD CHANCE </p><p>OF WINNING THE CONTRACTS. </p><p> </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENHANCE COOPERATION </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  ALL OF THIS COOPERATION LEADS TO ONE </p><p>CONCLUSION:  FOR THE U.S., BRUNEI IS </p><p>INCREASINGLY A FRIEND, AND ONE WORTH CULTIVATING </p><p>A BIT MORE THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST.  WITH A </p><p>VERY SMALL INVESTMENT IN TIME, EFFORT, AND </p><p>FUNDS, THE U.S. COULD SOLIDIFY THIS COOPERATION, </p><p>AND MOST LIKELY GAIN MORE, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL </p><p>FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL CAUSES </p><p>OF MUTUAL CONCERN, AND POSSIBLY SOME MORE </p><p>LUCRATIVE CONTRACTS FOR AMERICAN FIRMS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  I OFFER THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>A.  REQUEST BILATERAL FOR THE SULTAN WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT CLINTON ON THE MARGINS OF THE MANILA </p><p>APEC LEADERS MEETING, TO REPLACE THE ABORTED </p><p>OSAKA BILATERAL.  PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE SO </p><p>IMPORTANT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>BRUNEI.  THE SULTAN FEELS A RAPPORT WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT, WHICH BEGAN WITH THE SEATTLE APEC </p><p>LEADERS SUMMIT.  A SMALL MEASURE OF PERSONAL </p><p>CONTACT WITH THE PRESIDENT WOULD MAKE THE SULTAN </p><p>EVEN MORE RESPONSIVE TO OUR APPEALS FOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>B.  INVITE THE SULTAN FOR AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON.  I BELIEVE THAT BRUNEI IS THE ONLY </p><p>ASEAN COUNTRY (EXCEPT NEWLY ADMITTED VIETNAM) </p><p>WHOSE HEAD OF STATE AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER HAS </p><p>NOT BEEN INVITED TO WASHINGTON.  ONE RESPECTED </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIAL TOLD ME THAT PERHAPS IF THE </p><p>SULTAN MADE NASTY PUBLIC SPEECHES AGAINST THE </p><p>U.S., HE, LIKE MALAYSIA\'S MAHATIR, MIGHT ALSO BE </p><p>INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.  THE ABSENCE OF AN </p><p>OFFICIAL INVITATION IS AWKWARD BECAUSE THE </p><p>SULTAN WAS IN FACT INVITED ORALLY BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HIMSELF DURING THE SEATTLE LEADERS </p><p>MEETING.  PROVING THAT THIS WAS NOT JUST A </p><p>CASUAL "HOPE YOU CAN COME TO MY COUNTRY </p><p>SOMETIME" REMARK, PRESIDENT CLINTON REPEATED THE </p><p>INVITATION TO BRUNEI\'S AMBASSADOR WHEN HE </p><p>PRESENTED CREDENTIALS AT THE WHITE HOUSE A </p><p>COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER THE SEATTLE MEETING.  I </p><p>RECOMMEND THAT THE PRESIDENT, IN 1997, EXTEND A </p><p>FORMAL INVITATION TO THE SULTAN TO VISIT </p><p>WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>C.  ESTABLISH A JOINT COMMISSION BETWEEN THE </p><p>U.S. AND BRUNEI TO REVIEW ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THE </p><p>OVERALL STATE OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. </p><p>BRUNEI HAS THESE JOINT COMMISSIONS WITH MANY </p><p>COUNTRIES, INCLUDING CHINA, OMAN, PAKISTAN, </p><p>ETC.  THE MEETINGS ARE USUALLY CHAIRED AT THE </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY LEVEL, AND ARE HELD IN </p><p>ALTERNATE CAPITALS.  THE COMMISSIONS CONSIDER </p><p>WAYS TO ENHANCE COOPERATION IN THE POLITICAL, </p><p>ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL </p><p>FIELDS.  FOR THE U.S., A COMMISSION WOULD BE A </p><p>MEANS TO SHOW BRUNEI THAT WE BELIEVE THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP TO BE MORE THAN A SERIES OF TIN CUP </p><p>EXERCISES.  IT WOULD BRING THE ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY TO BRUNEI BIANNUALLY FOR BILATERAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS, GIVING VISIBLE EVIDENCE THAT WE </p><p>CARE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>D.  SCHEDULE MORE FREQUENT VISITS BY SENIOR USG </p><p>CIVILIAN OFFICIALS TO BRUNEI FOR BILATERAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  (U.S. SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS </p><p>VISIT BRUNEI REGULARLY; THESE VISITS SHOULD BE </p><p>MAINTAINED AT CURRENT LEVELS.)  THESE SHOULD </p><p>INCLUDE THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE, DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE (AND THE SECRETARY, IF HE IS </p><p>TOURING THE REGION), THE USTR, AND OUR </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS.  AGAIN, THESE </p><p>OCCASIONAL VISITS WOULD HAVE AS THEIR GOAL </p><p>SIMPLY SHOWING BRUNEI THAT WE DO NOT TAKE THEM </p><p>FOR GRANTED.  WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT IMMEDIATE </p><p>TANGIBLE BENEFITS, BUT OVER TIME SHOWING THAT WE </p><p>TAKE BRUNEI SERIOUSLY WILL, I AM CONFIDENT, PAY </p><p>DIVIDENDS IN TERMS OF INCREASED COOPERATION.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD INVITE SENIOR BRUNEIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS TO THE U.S. MORE FREQUENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>E.  FUND A SMALL INTERNATIONAL VISITOR AND </p><p>FULBRIGHT PROGRAM.  USIA STOPPED FUNDING THE </p><p>SMALL USIS EFFORT IN BRUNEI JANUARY 1, 1996. </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS EFFORT, I HAVE </p><p>CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN THE RUDIMENTS OF A USIS </p><p>OPERATION, SUCH AS DISTRIBUTING THE WIRELESS </p><p>FILE AND MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH BRUNEI\'S ONE </p><p>UNIVERSITY, DRAWING FROM THE EMBASSY\'S MINISCULE </p><p>BUDGET.  WE HAVE TWO INTERNATIONAL VISITOR </p><p>CANDIDATES IN THE PIPELINE FOR FY-96 PROGRAMS. </p><p>AT PRESENT WE HAVE AN OUTSTANDING FULBRIGHT </p><p>PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY, AND A SIMILARLY </p><p>OUTSTANDING USIA-PROVIDED LIBRARY FELLOW HELPING </p><p>TO ESTABLISH THE LIBRARY AT THE NEW UNIVERSITY </p><p>CAMPUS.  THE BRUNEIAN GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR ALL </p><p>EXPENSES FOR THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS, EXCEPT FOR </p><p>THEIR STIPEND.  DESPITE USIA\'S SHRINKING BUDGET, </p><p>FUNDS SHOULD BE FOUND TO CONTINUE A MODEST IV </p><p>AND FULBRIGHT PROGRAM HERE.  THREE IV GRANTS PER </p><p>YEAR, AND ONE FULBRIGHTER, WOULD COST THE USG NO </p><p>MORE THAN $100,000 PER YEAR, AND WOULD BE MONEY </p><p>WELL SPENT.  EXPOSURE TO THE US BY MID-LEVEL </p><p>BRUNEIAN OFFICIALS, AND THE REGULAR INCLUSION OF </p><p>A FULBRIGHT PROFESSOR ON THE FACULTY OF THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY, WHICH IS UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE </p><p>TO "ISLAMICIZE", YET WANTS TO EXPAND AND GROW </p><p>ACADEMICALLY, WOULD BE MONEY WELL SPENT. </p><p>FURTHER, STOPPING THESE PROGRAMS COULD BE VIEWED </p><p>BY THE BRUNEIAN GOVERNMENT AS A SNUB AND COULD </p><p>IMPACT NEGATIVELY ON THEIR WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>INCREASE COOPERATION WITH US IN OTHER AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THESE ARE MODEST PROPOSALS--A LITTLE FACE </p><p>TIME, A MODEST USIA EFFORT.  I URGE THAT THEY BE </p><p>FAVORABLY CONSIDERED, AND WISH MY SUCCESSOR WELL </p><p>IN BRINGING THEM TO FRUITION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TULL </p><p></p></div>
