<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR H. THOMAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, PHUM, PARM, ECON, ETRD, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA: DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE HEARS HOPES </p><p>FOR THE FUTURE DESPITE DISCOURAGING EVENTS IN THE PRESENT </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Deputy Secretary Armitage had four brief </p><p>"pull-aside" meetings at the start of a reception held in </p><p>his honor, August 22, with the Leader of the PA </p><p>Opposition the Maldivian High Commissioner, Tamil </p><p>National Alliance representatives, and the Leader of the </p><p>Muslim Congress.  D heard from three different Sri Lankan </p><p>political perspectives hopes that cohabitation might </p><p>still be possible and that the peace talks could bear </p><p>fruit.  He also heard the doubts of these groups about </p><p>the sincerity and abilities of each other, the GSL, and </p><p>the LTTE.  In all meetings, D explained his visit was a </p><p>result of President Bush\'s belief that, because of the </p><p>GSL\'s bold decisions on peace and economic reform, it is </p><p>time for the US to play a larger role in Sri Lanka.  D </p><p>questioned interlocutors on their opinions of the </p><p>appropriate role for the US at this time.  Most wanted </p><p>the US to expand its involvement and strongly support the </p><p>peace process.  Bilateral issues, including security </p><p>cooperation and Article 98 agreement on ICC dominated the </p><p>discussions with the Maldivian HC. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Opposition Leader Mahinda Rajapkase </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) People\'s Alliance (PA) Leader Mahinda Rajapakse </p><p>began by saying that everyone, PA included, wants peace, </p><p>but that most people in the South have reservations about </p><p>the sincerity of LTTE leader Prabhakaran.  Rajapakse </p><p>noted that previous peace efforts had failed, and many </p><p>believe that Prabhakaran, leader of the LTTE, is using </p><p>this ceasefire interval to build up his strength, and </p><p>will eventually take over the disputed areas. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On cohabitation between the President and the </p><p>prime Minister, Rajapakse said it would not work unless </p><p>the two leaders cooperate.  He continued that he was not </p><p>sure if enough MPs would vote with the government on a </p><p>Constitutional amendment to limit the President\'s power </p><p>to dissolve Parliament, but it was possible.  He referred </p><p>to recent meetings with MPs and the Party Secretary on </p><p>this issue and said he will meet with the President </p><p>immediately upon her return from the UK, and inform her </p><p>that some in the PA will vote with the PM\'s UNF. </p><p>Responding to a comment from D on the President\'s </p><p>possible dissolution of Parliament, Rajapakse said, "if </p><p>there are elections, there will be a bloodbath" because </p><p>people in the villages use the occasion to address </p><p>personal and political rivalries.  President Kumaratunga </p><p>will have to compromise, he said. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Rajapakse, areas where the US could </p><p>help are addressing the problems with the JVP, which is </p><p>now going into trade unions and organizing strikes; </p><p>speaking out for cohabitation; and getting India more </p><p>involved.  India would be seen as a counterweight to what </p><p>some perceive as a sympathetic bent toward the LTTE by </p><p>the Norwegians. </p><p> </p><p>Maldivian High Commissioner A. Azeez Yousef </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) After wishing Azeez luck on his imminent return to </p><p>Male\' after eight years in Colombo, D said he wanted the </p><p>Maldivian government to understand what US intentions </p><p>were in Sri Lanka, and explained the purpose of his </p><p>visit.  D then requested that Azeez ask his government to </p><p>consider entering into a bilateral agreement on the ICC </p><p>under Article 98.  The Ambassador noted previous </p><p>discussions on the topic with the government in Male\', </p><p>and that no decision had been conveyed yet. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Azeez said he had spoken with the President, who </p><p>had asked him to express the Maldivians\' gratitude for </p><p>the close relations between the U.S. and Maldives, </p><p>especially the bilateral cooperation on defense, saying </p><p>it gave them a sense of security.  He also conveyed the </p><p>GORM\'s appreciation for US support in resisting calls </p><p>within ECOSOC for its graduation from LDC status. </p><p>Finally, he noted the efforts for a Fulbright program in </p><p>the Maldives and asked for more support to send students </p><p>abroad for high school and higher education. </p><p> </p><p>Tamil National Alliance (TNA) </p><p>(comprised of smaller Tamil parties) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>7.  (C) R. Sampathan, Secretary General of the Tamil </p><p>United Liberation Front, started by saying that although </p><p>the ceasefire agreement was basically implemented, the </p><p>TNA\'s major concern remained that people could not yet </p><p>return to their homes.  He said when the military moves </p><p>out of a school or temple, as outlined in the MOU, they </p><p>frequently just go to the adjoining property.  In his </p><p>opinion, that does not constitute removal of forces. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Talking about the substance of a future </p><p>agreement, Sampathan said the TNA was against dividing </p><p>the country, but was compelled to call for separatism in </p><p>the past because the government was not ready to </p><p>restructure itself to include all citizens.  If the </p><p>country is not to be divided, the center should hold only </p><p>enough power -- in defense, foreign affairs and currency </p><p>-- to keep it from dividing.  In his opinion, the </p><p>government was not yet thinking about this.  He said that </p><p>the Tamils have no problem with the peace process since </p><p>the LTTE is on board, but that many Sinhalese are against </p><p>it.  He said if the country is to stay whole, the GSL </p><p>must recognize the Tamils as a distinct people with a </p><p>distinct heritage, and give them a devolved ability to </p><p>govern themselves and enough control to rehabilitate </p><p>their areas. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) N. Raviraj, a TULF member from Jaffna described </p><p>problems in his district that started with the ceasefire. </p><p>He stated that the army\'s new high security zones </p><p>incorporate people\'s property.  Most houses are destroyed </p><p>in these areas, he said, and the army occupies the ones </p><p>that aren\'t.  People in Jaffna are worried, he continued, </p><p>because they don\'t think the army will ever leave.  K. </p><p>Ponnambalam of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress followed up </p><p>by saying some families are moved out of their house so </p><p>the army can move in, and they only receive meager </p><p>rations to survive.  The TNA tries to show support for </p><p>the government, especially on the peace process, but it </p><p>is difficult, he said, and the alliance endures much </p><p>political pressure to withdraw that support.  T. </p><p>Thangavadivel, from Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization </p><p>noted that many steps have been taken, but the Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and some in the PA are trying to </p><p>spoil the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Sampathan said that in the TNA\'s meetings with </p><p>the LTTE, democracy and respect for minorities are </p><p>discussed, as is the belief that, "we don\'t want to treat </p><p>others the way the Sinhalese have treated us".  The </p><p>responsibility now is on the Sinhalese side, said </p><p>Sampathan.  When D countered that the TNA has </p><p>responsibilities too, including to the Muslims, Sampathan </p><p>said they would ensure their safety, rights, security and </p><p>even power sharing.  On a role for the US, Sampathan said </p><p>the US should be seen as evenhanded.  D explained that </p><p>the US would continue to condemn human rights abuses, and </p><p>will attempt to use economic programs to raise the level </p><p>of all in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>Ports Minister and </p><p>Leader of the Muslim Congress Rauf Hakeem </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>11.  (C) After giving D a brief historical view of Muslim </p><p>relations in Sri Lanka, Hakeem described his meeting with </p><p>Prabhakaran on April 13, saying he thought they came to </p><p>an agreement that the LTTE would not try to impose its </p><p>will on the Muslim communities.  Although Muslims realize </p><p>peace will not be easy to attain, they had some hope </p><p>after this meeting. Their experience since the ceasefire, </p><p>however, has not been good.  The violent incidents that </p><p>occurred against Muslims caused them to lose confidence </p><p>in Prabhakaran\'s control of his cadres.  The basic </p><p>problem, in Hakeem\'s view, has been the Muslims\' refusal </p><p>to be assimilated by the Tamils, and both groups\' desire </p><p>to assert themselves politically.  Problems are also </p><p>economic - fighting for scarce resources, he said. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The Muslims don\'t want to open another front in </p><p>the East, he said, but the LTTE wants to unite the north </p><p>and east to concentrate their power.  People are fearful </p><p>of the future, he continued, but the US public statements </p><p>to date have helped.  He said, "we depend on the US to </p><p>see that we get a fair deal.  We know you will stand for </p><p>what is right." </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
