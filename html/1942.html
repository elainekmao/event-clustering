<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002235 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ECON, OVIP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CODEL WATTS AND BIZDEL DISCUSS INVESTMENT </p><p>CLIMATE WITH PRESIDENT OBASANJO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: Ambassador Jeter accompanied Codel Watts, AUSTR </p><p>Whitaker and executives from Phillips Petroleum, Syntroleum, </p><p>Proctor and Gamble and Qualcomm to breakfast with President </p><p>Obasanjo.  Pointing to the need for foreign investment in </p><p>non-oil sectors, the President encouraged the U.S. companies </p><p>present to invest in solid minerals, telecommunications, </p><p>information technology, agricultural processing, and </p><p>manufacturing.  Obasanjo was extremely engaged throughout the </p><p>meeting, asking questions regarding AGOA and supporting </p><p>resolution on P&G\'s advocacy requests.  Following the </p><p>breakfast, Nigeria\'s President met with the entire business </p><p>delegation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On August 30, Congressmen J.C. Watts (R-Oklahoma), John </p><p>Lewis (D-Georgia), William Jefferson (D-Louisiana) and Eva </p><p>Clayton (D-North Carolina) joined President Obasanjo for </p><p>breakfast at his residence.  Ambassador Howard Jeter, AUSTR </p><p>Whitaker and visiting executives from Phillips, Syntroleum, </p><p>Proctor and Gamble and Qualcomm executives accompanied the </p><p>congressional delegation.  EconOff attended as notetaker. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Obasanjo welcomed the U.S visitors and thanked them for </p><p>traveling to Nigeria at an "auspicious time" for foreign </p><p>investment, as Nigeria "moves away from the ills of the </p><p>past."  The GON was in the process of reconstituting both </p><p>Nigeria,s human and physical capital infrastructure, he </p><p>said.  However, Nigeria was "not only looking inward, but </p><p>outward."  Obasanjo expressed the need for Nigeria to engage </p><p>foreign investors outside the oil and gas sector -- in </p><p>telecommunications, information technology, manufacturing and </p><p>the exploitation of solid minerals.  Employing all the right </p><p>buzzwords, Nigeria\'s President stated that the Nigerian </p><p>market needs more "purchasing power" in order to be more </p><p>active in the world economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Congressman Watts thanked the President for returning </p><p>early from China to host the delegation.  The Congressman </p><p>explained that he was pleased to have fulfilled the promise </p><p>made during his May visit to Abuja that he would return with </p><p>potential U.S. investors.  In order to fulfill his </p><p>commitment, Watts said, he had brought together the "Trade </p><p>Aid Coalition," comprised of U.S. companies with an interest </p><p>in promoting trade between the United States and Africa.  The </p><p>purpose of the Coalition would be to enhance trade with, and </p><p>economic growth in, Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Looking around the room inquiringly, the President noted </p><p>that no serious U.S. construction companies were now active </p><p>in Nigeria.  Ambassador Jeter responded that, while no U.S. </p><p>construction companies had entered the Nigerian market, U.S. </p><p>companies were attempting to enter other non-oil sector </p><p>markets.  The Ambassador specifically pointed to a U.S. </p><p>telecommunications company (read Motorola) that had </p><p>unsuccessfully attempted to enter the market for supplying </p><p>GSM equipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Philippe Bovay of Proctor and Gamble noted his company,s </p><p>interest in investing USD 30 million in a new manufacturing </p><p>facility in Ibadan.  Bovay commented that he was currently </p><p>working with the Federal Ministry of Industries to resolve </p><p>the problems of high tariffs on P&G,s manufacturing inputs </p><p>and on one P&G product -- Ariel detergent.  The President </p><p>became immediately engaged, began discussing the particulars </p><p>of the proposed investment and said, &I want resolution on </p><p>this issue.8  Bovay explained that P&G had asked for a </p><p>tariff reduction from 30 to zero percent on the manufacturing </p><p>equipment and inputs for its proposed facility.  Although the </p><p>GON had agreed to reduce these tariffs to 10 percent, P&G </p><p>would still like the tariffs reduced to zero.  P&G had also </p><p>requested lower tariffs on its high-quality detergent, Ariel, </p><p>which it would like to manufacture at the new facility. </p><p>Bovay said that P&G had sent a letter asking for resolution </p><p>on this issue in July to the Minister of Industries, but had </p><p>not yet received a response.  Obasanjo commented that he had </p><p>received a similar letter from Proctor and Gamble and </p><p>reiterated that he would like resolution on this issue as </p><p>soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  The President then turned to the need to resolve the </p><p>remaining issues for Nigeria\'s compliance with the textile </p><p>visa requirements under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act </p><p>(AGOA).  Ambassador Jeter noted that Nigeria was very close </p><p>to completing the AGOA requirements.  The Ambassador </p><p>commented on the benefits that AGOA could provide within the </p><p>textile manufacturing sector and asked AUSTR Rosa Whitaker to </p><p>explain further.  Whitaker cited Lesotho, a small land-locked </p><p>African nation, as an excellent example: Lesotho had </p><p>attracted over USD 100 million of investment in its textile </p><p>industry in the past several months because of AGOA. </p><p>Whitaker agreed that Nigeria was very close to fulfilling the </p><p>textile visa requirements, explaining that the one unresolved </p><p>issue involved the penalties applied to illegal transshipment </p><p>of goods.  Currently, Whitaker said, Nigeria,s customs code </p><p>only imposed a duty of one-half of the value of the goods ) </p><p>not a sufficient deterrent.  She noted that the countries </p><p>that have successfully met AGOA,s requirements were imposing </p><p>a penalty of at least three times the value of the goods. </p><p>The President reiterated his desire to reach resolution on </p><p>these issues and said that once a bill revising the customs </p><p>code was drafted, he would personally take it to the National </p><p>Assembly and see that it was enacted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Henry McGee of Phillips Petroleum introduced himself and </p><p>said that his company expected to sign the LNG proposal with </p><p>NNPC as early as the week of September 3.  (NOTE.  The MOU </p><p>was signed on September 5.  END NOTE.)  Seemingly familiar </p><p>with the project, President Obasanjo asked whether Phillips </p><p>would be able to complete the project by 2005.  McGee replied </p><p>that the target date was late 2006/early 2007.  However, if </p><p>all project phases proceed smoothly, Phillips could possibly </p><p>shave six to nine months off that time and complete the </p><p>project by early 2006.  President Obasanjo appeared pleased </p><p>with this news. </p><p>9.  Larry Weick of Syntroleum then took the opportunity to </p><p>introduce his company as a prospective investor.  He </p><p>explained that his company could assist Nigeria in three </p><p>areas: to reduce gas flaring, to increase electricity </p><p>production as a byproduct of flared gas, and to more </p><p>effectively use Nigeria,s natural resources through the </p><p>production of clear diesel fuel.  He described Syntroleum\'s </p><p>Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) process as one that uses air and, </p><p>therefore, was safer than other GTL processes.  President </p><p>Obasanjo held up the small clear vial of Syntroleum,s diesel </p><p>and appeared amazed at how clean the fuel looked.  Obasanjo </p><p>asked whether the fuel would be targeted for export.  Weick </p><p>replied that the diesel could be for both domestic </p><p>utilization and for export to markets in the U.S. and Europe. </p><p> Obasanjo inquired what quantity of electricity could be </p><p>produced from such a project.  Weick responded that it would </p><p>be dependent upon the location of the projects, adding that </p><p>the NNPC was choosing possible sites based on the need for </p><p>electricity.  Obasanjo asked how expensive the clear diesel </p><p>process was compared with normal diesel refining.  Weick </p><p>replied that Syntroleum\'s diesel fuel was competitive with </p><p>world oil prices of $18-$20 per barrel.  Seemingly pleased by </p><p>these answers, Obasanjo commented that OPEC was trying to </p><p>maintain prices at roughly $27/barrel, which would make this </p><p>venture worthwhile. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  After breakfast, President Obasanjo led the group to his </p><p>Council chambers where the remaining members of the business </p><p>delegation were present.  At this larger meeting, which Vice </p><p>President Atitku Abubakar also attended, President Obasanjo </p><p>again welcomed the Congressional and trade delegations to </p><p>Nigeria and noted the need for Nigeria to institute changes </p><p>on the inside while the international community helped </p><p>Nigeria from the outside.  He identified the sectors in </p><p>Nigeria that might most attract foreign investment: </p><p>infrastructure, where he said rehabilitation was already </p><p>underway; agriculture ("ready for modernization"); solid </p><p>minerals, such as aluminum, lead, and zinc; and oil and gas, </p><p>"although more gas than oil," he said.  The President </p><p>explained that the GON was working hard to take advantage of </p><p>the benefits offered by AGOA.  He said he wanted to take all </p><p>steps necessary to make Nigeria internationally competitive. </p><p>The President asked that those present not hesitate to let </p><p>him know, directly or through the U.S. Ambassador, what </p><p>Nigeria needed to do to attract foreign investment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Because Congressman Watt,s was indisposed at this time, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter offered remarks on his behalf.  The </p><p>Ambassador said that, during his visit in May, Congressman </p><p>Watts had promised to return to Nigeria with a trade </p><p>delegation.  With this trip in August, Watts had fulfilled </p><p>that commitment.  The Ambassador commented that there was </p><p>nothing else he would rather see than an increase in U.S. </p><p>investment in Nigeria.  He admitted that there were </p><p>peculiarities to the Nigerian market that had to be overcome. </p><p> However, the U.S. ) Nigeria strategic relationship must </p><p>include a greater commercial relationship with an emphasis on </p><p>developing the non-oil sectors of the economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. President Obasanjo then opened the floor to comments or </p><p>questions from the 30-plus business representatives.  One </p><p>U.S. businessman asked about the legal and regulatory issues </p><p>surrounding the privatization of the national </p><p>telecommunications company, NITEL.  Obasanjo commented that </p><p>the GON had ensured that the future of Nigeria\'s </p><p>telecommunications market would be driven by the private </p><p>sector; three of the four GSM licenses were granted to </p><p>private companies with one reserved for NITEL.  The President </p><p>referred the legal and regulatory question to Vice President </p><p>Abubakar in his role as Chairman of the National Council on </p><p>Privatization.  Abubakar explained that the GON had already </p><p>received expressions of interest in NITEL from eleven </p><p>international telecommunications companies.  Meanwhile, the </p><p>National Council on Privatization had forwarded to the </p><p>National Assembly a draft bill to strengthen the regulatory </p><p>authority of the Nigerian Communications Commission.  Once </p><p>NITEL had been privatized, the Vice President explained, a </p><p>second carrier would be licensed to establish strong </p><p>competition in the domestic telecommunication market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Comment.  Having just returned from China at 4:00am that </p><p>morning, President Obasanjo surprisingly remained highly </p><p>engaged throughout the meetings.  He was well versed in the </p><p>issues raised by the U.S. companies present at the breakfast </p><p>and expressed strong interest in seeing these issues </p><p>resolved.  The high level of access granted to visitors and </p><p>Mission officers is consistent and demonstrates the emphasis </p><p>that the Obasanjo Administration places on increasing </p><p>bilateral trade and investment with the United States.  Post </p><p>was very pleased to host the U.S. business delegation in </p><p>Abuja.  The wide-ranging interests of participants made it </p><p>difficult to effectively "match-make" them with Nigerian </p><p>businessmen and GON officials, however.  A tighter focus on a </p><p>few specific sectors, such as those identified by the </p><p>President -- agriculture/processing, solid minerals, </p><p>telecommunications and infrastructure -- would make future </p><p>trade delegations even more effective tools for strengthening </p><p>bilateral economic relations.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  This cable was not cleared with the CODEL. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
