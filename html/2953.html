<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002432 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KISL, SOCI, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SENIOR ISLAMIC FIGURES PRAISE CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM </p><p>COOPERATION, BUT SHOW DEEP MISTRUST OF ISRAEL AND JUDAISM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm for Reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The Chief Justice of the Sharia Court and the Mufti </p><p>of the Kingdom recently expressed to us their strong </p><p>condemnation of Israeli violence in the West Bank and of </p><p>suicide bombings, but asked that the U.S. adopt a "more just" </p><p>position defending the rights of Palestinians against Israeli </p><p>occupation.  Both praised the piety and religious tolerance </p><p>of Americans, noting that their offices spend much of their </p><p>time dealing with the personal problems of expatriate </p><p>Jordanians living in the West.  Both emphasized </p><p>Christian-Muslim understanding and cooperation in Jordan. </p><p>Unfortunately, both also drew on Quranic verses and popular </p><p>myths about Judaism to underscore their mistrust of Israel. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>YES TO PALESTINIANS, NO TO TERRORISM </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  During recent separate meetings with PolCouns, the </p><p>Chief Justice of the Sharia Court, Sheikh Izzeddine </p><p>al-Tamimi, and the Mufti of the Kingdom, Sheikh Said </p><p>al-Hijjawi, both flagged the continuing Israeli occupation of </p><p>the West Bank and Gaza and recent "aggression" into </p><p>Palestinian cities as the most important political issue </p><p>facing their flock.  Both Tamimi and Hijjawi asserted that </p><p>Israel\'s use of U.S.-provided F-16\'s, Apache helicopters, and </p><p>missiles have convinced average Jordanians and Muslims that </p><p>the U.S. supports Israeli killing of Palestinians.  Hijjawi </p><p>argued that the U.S. must use the principles of religion to </p><p>develop a "more just" policy that supports the rights of </p><p>innocent Palestinians against Israeli occupation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Both were quick, however, to reject the killing of </p><p>civilians in the name of Islam, quoting verses of the Quran </p><p>which call for the protection of civilians in times of war. </p><p>The Quran does not permit suicide bombings against innocent </p><p>civilians, Tamimi argued, although he said that the U.S. and </p><p>Israel must understand that the long Israeli occupation has </p><p>convinced many Palestinians that they have no other way to </p><p>oppose the occupation.  Hijjawi strongly rejected the </p><p>philosophy of Osama Bin Laden, saying that Bin Laden had </p><p>hijacked the peaceful spirit of Islam and used it to </p><p>implement his violent, hateful agenda.  The West, and </p><p>especially the U.S., should not mistake Bin Laden\'s misdeeds </p><p>for the true Islam, which respects the three monotheistic </p><p>religions:  Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>ISLAM IN THE U.S. </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4  (C)  PolCouns explained that, despite the secular nature </p><p>of the U.S. government, religious faith is an important and </p><p>deeply rooted element in American society.  Americans are </p><p>free to worship in the way that they choose, and the vast </p><p>majority of Americans also respect that others have the same </p><p>right.  It is this religious freedom and tolerance that have </p><p>permitted Islam and other religions to flourish in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Both Tamimi and Hijjawi expressed admiration for the </p><p>religious freedom enjoyed in the United States.  Tamimi said </p><p>that Jordanian Sharia courts deal extensively with Islamic </p><p>centers in the United States to obtain or verify birth, </p><p>death, marriage, and divorce records.  He praised the </p><p>professionalism of American Islamic Centers, noting that </p><p>nearly all of these centers comment favorably on their close </p><p>and cooperative relations with local American governmental </p><p>authorities. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>ISLAM IN THE MODERN WORLD </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The Chief Justice said that Jordanian Sharia courts </p><p>deal largely with personal status issues (marriage, divorce, </p><p>death, inheritance) for Muslim citizens.  These issues have </p><p>become more complicated as Jordanian Muslims have traveled </p><p>abroad, and met and married people of other faiths in civil </p><p>ceremonies.  In contrast, the Mufti explained that his office </p><p>has a broad -- in fact, borderless -- mandate:  to provide </p><p>proper Islamic guidance to average citizens who have </p><p>questions about how to deal with personal problems.  Most </p><p>questions -- the proper way to treat new relatives in a </p><p>marriage or the need to maintain personal financial </p><p>discipline -- are easy to link to the Quran and the hadith </p><p>(the collected sayings of the Prophet Mohammed).  However, </p><p>the Mufti admitted, the researchers in his office spend a lot </p><p>of time answering e-mailed questions from Jordanians living </p><p>in the West about typically modern problems -- for example, </p><p>what to do about incorrect credit card charges, regulating </p><p>their children\'s viewing of cable or satellite television, </p><p>and non-Muslim peer pressure on teenage Muslims to date and </p><p>drink alcohol. </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>TOLERANT OF CHRISTIANITY, LESS SO OF JUDAISM </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Both Tamimi and Hijjawi emphasized the strong </p><p>Jordanian tradition of tolerance and understanding between </p><p>Muslims and Christians.  Hijjawi commented that he and a </p><p>prominent activist Eastern Catholic (Malkite) priest (who is </p><p>well and favorably known to the Embassy) were </p><p>"co-conspirators" on several projects to promote </p><p>Muslim-Christian understanding.  Tamimi, too, talked of the </p><p>long-standing cooperation between Christians and Muslims, </p><p>saying that the Christian sects who control Jerusalem\'s </p><p>Church of the Holy Sepulcher have entrusted the keys of the </p><p>Church to a Muslim. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Unfortunately, these positive feelings were not </p><p>nearly as strong with regard to Judaism.  Why is it that Jews </p><p>demand a "Jewish state" in Jerusalem, Hijjawi asked, when </p><p>there is no archeological proof that a Jewish temple ever </p><p>existed under the Haram al-Sharif (the Muslim complex </p><p>containing the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque on top of </p><p>Temple Mount)?  From there, Hijjawi wove a familiar web of </p><p>suspicion of Israel based on half-truths and popular </p><p>misconceptions.  Tamimi, as well, criticized "Zionist </p><p>extremists" for perpetuating the "Jewish occupation" of the </p><p>West Bank and Gaza, and cited verses from the Quran advising </p><p>that Muslims use great caution in dealing with Jews. </p><p>PolCouns responded that Arabs and Muslims would have to deal </p><p>with Jewish beliefs just as they asked Israel to deal with </p><p>Islamic beliefs. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Both Tamimi and Hijjawi are moderate, establishment </p><p>Islamic figures who represent mainstream Jordanian Sunni </p><p>thought.  Both expressed admiration for the piety and freedom </p><p>of Americans, are strong advocates for Muslim-Christian </p><p>understanding in Jordan, and publicly condemned (and continue </p><p>to condemn) the September 11 attacks as un-Islamic.  Hijjawi </p><p>recalled his experience leading a delegation of Muslim </p><p>officials to pay respects to the Ambassador at the Embassy\'s </p><p>condolence tent after the attacks. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  However, even while rejecting Bin Laden\'s message </p><p>against Christians and Jews, both revealed in a matter of </p><p>fact way their suspicion of Israel based both in Quranic </p><p>passages critical of Jews and popular misconceptions of </p><p>Judaism and Israel.  This attitude on the part of the two </p><p>most senior Islamic officials in Jordan gives some indication </p><p>of how deep this current runs in Jordanian society. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
