<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003412 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CY, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S CYPRUS POLICY:  WHAT NOW? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. NICOSIA 901 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 2155 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 2431 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Assessments of how Turkey should move on </p><p>Cyprus vary in both the GOT and Turkish State.  Some (e.g., </p><p>FonMin Gul) are working to overcome what they recognize as </p><p>pressure on Turkey\'s interests following the failure of the </p><p>UN-sponsored Cyprus talks and the EU\'s decision to accept a </p><p>divided Cyprus as a member.  However, while promoting the </p><p>recent series of Turkish and Turkish Cypriot </p><p>confidence-building initiatives, others in the MFA </p><p>bureaucracy and elsewhere remain reluctant to take bold steps </p><p>toward a comprehensive solution, even though they recognize </p><p>that such moves would help improve Turkish-EU and </p><p>U.S.-Turkish relations.  These holdouts continue to reject </p><p>the UNSYG plan (Annan III) as the basis for further </p><p>negotiations.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Pyrrhic Victory for the Establishment? </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Turkey (both GOT and elements of the State) put itself </p><p>in a bind by insisting it could not handle Iraq and Cyprus </p><p>simultaneously, and then failing to take clear and beneficial </p><p>decisions on both. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On Cyprus policy, The ability of the pro-status-quo </p><p>camp in Ankara to prevent Erdogan from embracing Annan III </p><p>appeared at first to be a victory for an Establishment that </p><p>fears the AK Party and P.M. Erdogan as existential threats to </p><p>its dominance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- TGS J5 Lt. Gen Turgut told visiting DAS Pascoe May 22 that </p><p>the key to a successful resolution of the Cyprus problem was </p><p>ensuring that the Turkish and Cypriot communities live on the </p><p>island as equal partners.  Turgut said that if Turkey had </p><p>accepted the Annan III plan, in ten years time, there would </p><p>not be any Turkish residing on the island.  All of the "rich" </p><p>would buy all of the land the "poor" would be left with </p><p>nothing, forced to leave.  Turgut predicated that in the end, </p><p>"you would have another Palestine."  He added that Turkish </p><p>Cypriots who demonstrated against Denktas and the status quo </p><p>are "communists." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Erdogan initially strongly criticized Denktas and the </p><p>GOT\'s business-as-usual approach on Cyprus, but ultimately </p><p>succumbed to Establishment pressure and backed off. </p><p>Erdogan\'s May 9 visit to Cyprus reflected this retreat as he </p><p>called simultaneously for both Annan III and a "sovereign </p><p>TRNC" in an attempt to placate both hard liners and those </p><p>looking for a new opening.  Now, however, the Erdogan </p><p>government, with FonMin Gul taking the lead, is once again </p><p>looking for room to maneuver. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- At the same time, as the draftsman of Turkey\'s Cyprus </p><p>diplomacy, the MFA, though charged with damage control and </p><p>responding to a barrage of international criticism, is </p><p>ultimately hewing to its Establishment line, one that FonMin </p><p>Gul criticized as a "non-solution solution" in the beginning </p><p>of his short tenure as P.M.  MFA officials are trying to </p><p>shift blame for the failure of the talks from Turkey and </p><p>Denktas, and toward the UN and EU for seeking too high a </p><p>price from Ankara.  They argue that progress on Cyprus </p><p>requires keeping the door open to an Annan Plan -- even as </p><p>they reject the plan itself as a basis for negotiations (ref </p><p>C). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Trying a different tack on May 22, MFA U/S Ziyal </p><p>asserted to Ambassador and DAS Pascoe that the principal </p><p>reason Turkey ultimately rejected the Annan Plan was its </p><p>"unacceptable" requirement that "100 thousand Turkish </p><p>Cypriots" -- 50% of the population, according to Ziyal -- </p><p>would eventually have to leave home.  Ambassador Pearson </p><p>replied that the figure cited by Ziyal does not coincide with </p><p>our understanding, and that Turkish and U.S. diplomats in </p><p>Ankara should be willing to conduct a review of the numbers </p><p>-- and what was or was not called for under the plan.  Cyprus </p><p>DG Apakan later reiterated Ziyal\'s point, adding that it is </p><p>also "too much" to expect that Turkey and the "TRNC" would </p><p>simultaneously accept the return of "85-90 thousand" Greek </p><p>Cypriots to the north. </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>GOT Taking Steps -- or Walking in Place? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) According to Apakan, Turkey is evaluating its Cyprus </p><p>policy in the wake of the failed talks on three "fronts": the </p><p>UN, the EU, and the "realities on the ground" on the island. </p><p>The GOT is trying to change the environment on Cyprus </p><p>through measures that "do not substitute, but will </p><p>facilitate" and reinvigorate efforts to find a comprehensive </p><p>settlement, he said.  Denktas, he stated, has taken the </p><p>initiative in recent weeks by opening the "TRNC" border to </p><p>Greek Cypriot tourists, allowing them to visit their former </p><p>homes for the first time since 1974 and generating good will </p><p>on the island.  DAS Pascoe responded that the evident good </p><p>will on both sides gives the lie to the arguments that Greek- </p><p>and Turkish-Cypriots could never get along -- and </p><p>demonstrates instead the desire on both sides to cut a deal. </p><p>Apakan demurred.  Apakan also noted the GOT\'s decision, </p><p>announced by Erdogan May 16, to allow Greek Cypriots to </p><p>travel to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The next step, Apakan argued, should be taken by the </p><p>other side -- to end the de facto embargo of the north. </p><p>"There is neither an EU nor UN decision imposing a formal </p><p>embargo on the \'TRNC,\'" he said.  An axiom of the methodology </p><p>of conflict resolution holds that settlements are reached </p><p>between equal sides, Apakan asserted.  To redress the </p><p>imbalance and as a prerequisite for a solution on Cyprus, the </p><p>"TRNC" should be allowed direct access to the wider world. </p><p>"End the embargo and the Cyprus problem will be settled," he </p><p>opined. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Implications </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) At a political level the GOT recognizes it is in a </p><p>bind over Cyprus.  At the same time, the MFA\'s impulse is </p><p>directed primarily toward damage control, not by any sense </p><p>that Turkish policies are a dead end.  Opening the "TRNC" </p><p>border and allowing Greek Cypriots to travel to Turkey, </p><p>though laudable, do not signal a sea-change in Turkey\'s </p><p>approach to Cyprus.  In fact, the rigidity of the TGS and MFA </p><p>approach to Cyprus policy is a manifestation of a wider, </p><p>systemic problem of State Establishment (vice civilian </p><p>government) dominance of government policymaking, and of the </p><p>alignment of political players in Turkey\'s rough-and-tumble </p><p>domestic political theater.  Those without strong emotional, </p><p>political, or pecuniary ties to Denktas and the current </p><p>GOT-"TRNC" machinery, e.g., Erdogan and Gul, have </p><p>demonstrated that they want to make a breakthrough.  At the </p><p>same time, those who rigidly adhere to traditional Turkish </p><p>State policy -- and those who recognize the tactical problems </p><p>associated with appearing opposed to change but continue </p><p>nevertheless to hew to the Establishment line -- have the </p><p>upper hand, discouraging the kind of comprehensive </p><p>risk-taking that might pave the way for a solution on Cyprus. </p><p> Consequently, Turkish flexibility on Cyprus may only be </p><p>possible as an outcome of AK\'s ongoing effort to crack the </p><p>Establishment\'s policymaking dominance. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
