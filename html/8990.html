END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A) Description of the Activity: Dr. David E. Lewis, Vice </p><p>President of Manchester Trade, Ltd., visited Honduras June 1- </p><p>7, 2003, as a U.S. Speaker on the U.S.-Central American Free </p><p>Trade Agreement (US-CAFTA). During his weeklong program, </p><p>sponsored by PAS for the first three days and by </p><p>USAID/Honduras the other two days, he spoke to private </p><p>sector organizations, senior and mid-level government </p><p>officials, academics, members of the Honduran Congress, </p><p>labor union representatives, and the general public.  He </p><p>also participated in a PAS-organized press conference, a </p><p>live morning TV talk show with the Minister of Industry and </p><p>Commerce, and was guest of honor at a luncheon hosted by the </p><p>PAO. </p><p> </p><p>B) Date: June 1 - 4, 2003 </p><p>   Fiscal year: FY-03, Third Quarter </p><p> </p><p>C) Justification and Objective: To discuss with Honduran </p><p>audiences the benefits of free trade in promoting economic </p><p>growth and development. </p><p> </p><p>D) Tracker No. 17827; MPP Goal: Regional Stability, U.S. </p><p>Exports, Economic Development and Mutual Understanding. </p><p>Audience reached: Approximately 350 people directly, </p><p>including representatives from the public and private </p><p>sectors; members of the labor unions; students and </p><p>professors from the National Autonomous University\'s Central </p><p>American Graduate Program in Economics and Development </p><p>Planning (POSCAE); and the general public.  His </p><p>participation in a live TV program with nationwide coverage </p><p>and a PAS-arranged press conference allowed Dr. Lewis to </p><p>reach a large number of the general public. </p><p> </p><p>E)  Result/Impact: Excellent/Excellent </p><p> </p><p>The post fully met its objective for this program by </p><p>providing forums in which to discuss the opportunities, </p><p>challenges and benefits for Honduras in the CAFTA, what U.S. </p><p>business seeks, the importance of Central American </p><p>integration, and the fact that CAFTA is only the first step </p><p>in a long-term trade relationship with the U.S.  Most </p><p>important of all, Dr. Lewis stressed that CAFTA is an </p><p>opportunity to reform the economy and the legal system.  He </p><p>also noted that it was the Central American countries who </p><p>had requested a FTA with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>Dr. David Lewis conducted an intensive program during his </p><p>visit to Honduras in his dual role as a U.S. Speaker on the </p><p>U.S.-Central American Free Trade Agreement and a consultant </p><p>with USAID/Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>On his first program day, Dr. Lewis lectured 20 students and </p><p>faculty (among them Dr. Hugo Noe Pino, former Honduran </p><p>Ambassador to the U.S.) at the POSCAE, was briefed by the </p><p>DCM and other Embassy officials, and was guest of honor at a </p><p>lunch hosted by the Honduran-American Chamber of Commerce </p><p>(AMCHAM).  At the end of the day, he held a roundtable </p><p>discussion with members of the Honduran Council for Private </p><p>Enterprise (COHEP). </p><p> </p><p>The following day, Dr. Lewis appeared on "Frente a Frente," </p><p>the interview segment of Honduras\'s most watched morning TV </p><p>news program, with Minister of Industry and Commerce Norman </p><p>Garcia.  During the 45-minute program, he made the point </p><p>that Central America needs to identify what the U.S. market </p><p>demands and find out how they can supply it, that Central </p><p>America is negotiating with two fronts - the internal </p><p>process among the five countries and with the U.S., and that </p><p>nothing is final until the negotiations end. The program </p><p>moderator expressed appreciation of the U.S. Embassy\'s </p><p>outreach with publications such as IIP\'s "The Language of </p><p>Commerce" and the brochure "US-CAFTA." </p><p> </p><p>Afterwards, Dr. Lewis held a roundtable discussion with the </p><p>Vice Minister of Finance, the Director of the Income Tax </p><p>Bureau and Customs officials to discuss how lower tariffs </p><p>will reduce government income and how to substitute for </p><p>them.  He also stressed the political decisions that will </p><p>have to be taken to make the adjustments and noted that </p><p>standardized import/export procedures are an incentive for </p><p>foreign investment. </p><p> </p><p>Following this meeting, Dr. Lewis held a press conference in </p><p>PAS, which was featured in all four newspapers and on </p><p>national TV and four major radio stations </p><p> </p><p>PAO hosted a luncheon for David Lewis with members of the </p><p>Honduran Congress, labor union leaders and representatives </p><p>of private sector organizations.  During the lunch, labor </p><p>union officials asked if we could schedule a meeting with </p><p>Dr. Lewis so that their leadership and the Minister of Labor </p><p>could discuss their concerns in depth.  In addition, one of </p><p>the congressmen attending decided to arrange a meeting with </p><p>the President of the National Congress and several members </p><p>of the Commission on Trade. </p><p> </p><p>Dr. Lewis participated in a public program at the </p><p>Tegucigalpa Chamber of Commerce, using his PowerPoint </p><p>presentation "CAFTA and Honduras: Challenges and </p><p>Opportunities" to address the background and issues </p><p>surrounding CAFTA and initiate a discussion on how </p><p>agricultural, small business and other sectors could take </p><p>advantage of CAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>The following day, Dr. Lewis traveled to the northern city </p><p>of San Pedro Sula, accompanied by the PAO and a USAID </p><p>official, to meet with the Honduran Apparel Manufacturers </p><p>Association ("Maquiladores") and the Cortes Chamber of </p><p>Commerce and Industry (CCIC) and to participate in a public </p><p>program.  The "Maquiladores," by far the best-prepared </p><p>sector in the negotiations, discussed the textile proposal </p><p>on the table vis--vis CBI and GSP benefits and their hope </p><p>that the U.S. would present a more liberal proposal. </p><p> </p><p>Upon returning to Tegucigalpa, Dr. Lewis continued his </p><p>program with USAID/Honduras, meeting with the Minister of </p><p>Industry and Commerce and members of the Honduran </p><p>negotiating team, the President and Vice President of the </p><p>Honduran Congress, and representatives from the labor </p><p>unions. </p><p> </p><p>Throughout his presentations, Dr. Lewis tried to make the </p><p>following points with all his audiences: (1) an FTA is an </p><p>instrument for economic development, not a replacement for a </p><p>national economic development plan to overcome poverty; (2) </p><p>Honduras needs to invest in its human resources; (3) in </p><p>international negotiations each nation must be aware of its </p><p>important national interests in order to get the greatest </p><p>benefit for its economy; (4) Honduras needs to decide where </p><p>it wants to be 50 years from now; (5) CBI and GSP are </p><p>government-to-government agreements and can be cancelled </p><p>anytime, whereas an FTA is a contractual commitment that </p><p>involves all sectors; and (6) countries need to find out </p><p>what the market demands and how they can supply it. </p><p> </p><p>PAS Tegucigalpa highly recommends Dr. Lewis for future </p><p>programs.  His vast experience in international trade and </p><p>his knowledge of Latin America, plus his fluent Spanish and </p><p>hard-working disposition, make him an ideal speaker.  He </p><p>immediately establishes excellent rapport with his audiences </p><p>and manages to keep the discussion on track.  We would </p><p>welcome him back at any time. </p><p> </p><p>Post distributed copies of IIP handouts, a pamphlet </p><p>promoting our IRC, and Dr. Lewis\'s presentation at all the </p><p>venues. </p><p> </p><p>F) Non-USG Sources of In-country Funding/In-kind Support and </p><p>Amount: The private sector organizations provided venues and </p><p>coffee breaks for the conferences, and the other host </p><p>institutions provided conference facilities for their </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>G) Quality of U.S. Support and IIP Offices Involved:  Very </p><p>Good.  Post appreciates Gloria Lloyd and Camille Barone\'s </p><p>assistance in making financial arrangements for this </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
