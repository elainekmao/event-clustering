O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, EFIN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Banknote Shortage Still Acute </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: It has become exceedingly difficult to secure </p><p>paper money in Zimbabwe.  Bank lines stretch to several </p><p>blocks, with angry account-holders occasionally resorting </p><p>to violence.  The GOZ is blaming the Reserve Bank, </p><p>opposition party and several others, but taking no </p><p>visible action to alleviate the crisis.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Banknotes now earn a premium of 15-40 percent when </p><p>exchanged for checks.  It appears the Reserve Bank </p><p>started to run short of funds for imported ink and paper </p><p>to print money in March.  Some local observers suggest </p><p>the tightening of the M1 monetary aggregate developed </p><p>into a misguided attempt to rein in inflation or shore up </p><p>the Zimdollar.  In fact, Zimbabwe\'s currency has devalued </p><p>from Z$ 690 to Z$ 3350 : US$1 since a year ago, making it </p><p>prohibitively expensive to print Z$ 500 notes, the </p><p>highest in circulation.  (It now costs over Z$ 1,000 to </p><p>print a Z$ 500 note worth 17 U.S. cents.) </p><p> </p><p>Potential for Violence </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>3. The poor are bearing the brunt of the crisis, since </p><p>the better-heeled can fulfill most consumption needs </p><p>through check or debit-card.  Lower-income Zimbabweans </p><p>either do not qualify for these instruments or shop at </p><p>places that do not accept them.  Thursday is month-end </p><p>payday for many Zimbabweans; financial institutions are </p><p>bracing for a potentially explosive situation.  Many </p><p>banks are already limiting withdrawals to Z$ 10,000 or Z$ </p><p>5,000 - an agonizing wait for one buck-seventy in US$ </p><p>terms. </p><p> </p><p>4. There is no indication the economy has begun to </p><p>dollarize (or "randize"), even though large quantities of </p><p>forex are flowing through Zimbabwe.  One U.S. firm, </p><p>Cargill, has circulated its own Z$ 10,000 note, backed by </p><p>deposits at Standard Chartered, but the new notes have </p><p>drawn both counterfeiters and the GOZ\'s ire. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. The banknote crisis strikes a lasting blow to the </p><p>integrity of the Zimbabwe\'s relatively sophisticated </p><p>banking system.  That the GOZ will not opt for the </p><p>obvious short-term solution - print a larger note with </p><p>fewer security features - speaks volumes about its </p><p>mindset and decision-making paralysis.  By producing a </p><p>banknote of reasonable tender (e.g., Z$ 50,000, worth US$ </p><p>17), the GOZ feels it would recognize openly the </p><p>devastation of the currency and, by extension, the </p><p>economy.  The GOZ prefers to treat foreign currency in </p><p>abstract terms, or at unsupported official exchange </p><p>rates.  It talks of introducing a Z$ 1,000 note, but as </p><p>in negotiations to normalize the fuel price, moves so </p><p>languidly that it forever chases ever-worsening costs. </p><p>In a collapsing economy, last month\'s medicine does </p><p>little for today\'s pain. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
