<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 008527 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2010 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: THE NEW GOVERNMENT\'S ECONOMIC TEAM STARTS WORK, </p><p>CLARIFIES PORTFOLIOS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Prime Minister Gul announced the portfolios </p><p>of the  state ministers, dividing supervision of the economic </p><p>agencies between Deputy PM Abdullatif Sener (privatization, </p><p>banking and capital markets boards), State Minister Ali </p><p>Babacan (Treasury, Central Bank and main state banks), and </p><p>State Minister Kursat Tuzmen (foreign trade).  Babacan, with </p><p>his office in the Treasury, is likely to inherit the Dervis </p><p>role of coordinating with the IMF and World Bank, and being </p><p>the economic program\'s public spokesman, though Sener and </p><p>Finance Minister Unakitan are both close to AK Chairman </p><p>Erdogan, and will have key roles in economic policy-making. </p><p>Treasury U/S Oztrak told us he is impressed with Babacan, </p><p>though he gives an initial mixed review on AK policy </p><p>positions.  The new team is good on privatization and foreign </p><p>direct investment, but "need education" on IMF relations, tax </p><p>reform, disinflation target, and banking sector reform.  The </p><p>last issue is critical, and Oztrak said he warned Erdogan in </p><p>his initial briefing that the government must keep its hands </p><p>off the BRSA.  At a DCM-hosted iftar for AK parliamentarians </p><p>this week, the deputies voiced differences on the primary </p><p>surplus target of 6.5 percent of GNP.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Treasury Undersecretary Impressed with New Team; </p><p>But More "Education" Work Ahead </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On November 19, Treasury U/S Oztrak told us his </p><p>first contacts with the newly elected AK parliamentarians and </p><p>new ministers were positive.  At his and Central Bank </p><p>Governor Serdengecti\'s initial briefing of senior AK </p><p>officials,  including Erdogan, they listened carefully, took </p><p>notes and asked good questions. Oztrak meets daily with State </p><p>Minister Babacan who "talks the same language as me, learns </p><p>quickly and is very sensitive to market reactions." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Oztrak is also optimistic about progress on the </p><p>macro targets.  This year\'s growth could reach 6 percent of </p><p>GNP (the formal target was increased from 3 to 4 percent last </p><p>month).  The growth story is a healthy mix of exports and </p><p>pick-up of domestic demand.  But 6 percent growth may raise </p><p>concerns of the economy over-heating, he continued, thus </p><p>providing another reason for keeping a high primary surplus </p><p>of 6.5 percent of GNP for 2003.  On meeting the year-end </p><p>primary surplus, Oztrak said that last week\'s state </p><p>enterprise price increases (tobacco and alcohol products, </p><p>tea, and sugar) will "keep us close to the 6.5 percent </p><p>target."  (Comment:  IMF resrep told us separately this is a </p><p>"positive spin.")   If the GOT keeps the 6.5 percent primary </p><p>surplus in 2003, and markets stay positive, then Oztrak sees </p><p>a chance to reduce public sector debt to GNP ratio - from the </p><p>current target of 77 percent at year-end 2003 to the low 70s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On policy issues, Oztrak gave a preliminary mixed </p><p>review of the new team.  On the positive side, they sounded </p><p>good on pushing the foreign direct investment and </p><p>privatization agendas.   There are, however, some concerns: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  IMF relations.  Oztrak understands the political need for </p><p>calling for a new reform program, but he thinks the GOT </p><p>should say:  "the general framework of the existing program </p><p>is working and we will preserve it."  Within that framework, </p><p>there is room per Oztrak to put more emphasis on socially </p><p>vulnerable groups, to improve public sector governance and </p><p>the investment environment.  On scheduling an IMF mission, </p><p>Oztrak wants to quickly finish the outstanding Fourth Review </p><p>conditions before discussing the 2003 program.  He believes </p><p>Babacan wants a mid-December IMF mission to combine both the </p><p>Fourth Review and also a detailed program for 2003. </p><p>(Comment: Babacan told us he wants to hold informal talks </p><p>with the IMF on the 2003 program without the Treasury staff </p><p>and before a formal Mission, reftel.  This may be </p><p>unrealistic, since Babacan doesn\'t have all the information </p><p>and numbers at his fingertips, like the Treasury staff.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Disinflation. The GOT program needs to continue focusing </p><p>on disinflation, per Oztrak, though the new ministers are not </p><p>mentioning it. (Note:  The pro-Islamist business association </p><p>MUSIAD on November 20 announced that the 2003 GOT program </p><p>should focus on "growth not inflation.")   Current Central </p><p>Bank projections, based on core inflation trends, show a 2003 </p><p>year-end 26 percent CPI, whereas the program calls for 20 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Tax Reform.  Oztrak said instead of annulling the </p><p>"financial year zero law," the new GOT should delay its </p><p>scheduled January 1, 2003 implementation, and make it part of </p><p>a direct tax reform package to be introduced in 2003.  (Note: </p><p> The financial year zero law, adopted in July 1998, is </p><p>intended to register the underground economy.  The law\'s </p><p>implementation has been delayed and is now scheduled to enter </p><p>into force on January 1, 2003, and gives Turkish residents a </p><p>certain period to report to their local tax offices their </p><p>unrecorded wealth without penalty.  Septel covers the debate </p><p>on this law.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Banking Sector Reform.  "AK is confused about the BRSA," </p><p>Oztrak said.  "I told Erdogan openly that continued </p><p>restructuring of the sector is a key benchmark for the local </p><p>and international financial communities.  We can\'t afford any </p><p>perception of flexibility."  Oztrak said the concern is with </p><p>Yapi Kredi, and he sees the problem as affecting Treasury\'s </p><p>debt management capability:  "If there\'s a sick player in the </p><p>system, holding our papers, this puts pressures on the player </p><p>to sell the papers, which increases the risk premium for </p><p>everyone holding the papers."  The banking sector\'s financial </p><p>mediation role is key to growth in 2003, per Oztrak, thus the </p><p>need to keep the GOT\'s hands off of the BRSA.  (Comment:  The </p><p>new government has recently backed away from earlier </p><p>criticism of BRSA.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Oztrak is uncertain of his future in the government. </p><p>"They have to have confidence in me, and I have to have </p><p>confidence in them."  He told us PM Gul was the most </p><p>reasonable person in the 1996/97 Refah-Yol government.  "We </p><p>in the bureaucracy used to come to him to solve all sorts of </p><p>problems."  On the other hand, DPM Sener (formerly Finance </p><p>Minister) "just accepted whatever instructions Erbakan gave </p><p>him." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reinforcing the Issues with AK Parliamentarians </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Oztrak\'s mixed review of the new team\'s policy </p><p>positions was reinforced during an iftar for AK </p><p>parliamentarians hosted by the DCM.  We heard some </p><p>differences on economic policy between younger MPs Reha </p><p>Denemec and Ibrahim Ozal, and the "old guard" Minister of </p><p>Industry Ali Coskun.   Ozal and Denemec thought the 2003 </p><p>budget needed to keep the 6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus, </p><p>whereas Coskun focused on the need for "pump priming." </p><p>Coskun proposed that the primary surplus could be lowered, </p><p>because real interest rates were coming down (he said the </p><p>target was 10 percent) and the budget would cut public </p><p>investment and agency spending.  DCM suggested that the GOT </p><p>budget needed to show fiscal discipline, and that the GOT </p><p>shoudn\'t plan to spend savings that hadn\'t yet materialized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) On the positive side, Industry Minister Coskun said </p><p>the new GOT was committed to resolving foreign investment </p><p>disputes.  The draft Foreign Direct Investment law now in </p><p>parliament would be revised "to be more liberal."  The new </p><p>GOT was putting together a list of 18 FDI disputes for </p><p>immediate resolution.  "You\'ll come to thank us," Coskun </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State Ministers\' Portfolios Announced </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) On afternoon of November 21, PM Abdullah Gul </p><p>announced the portfolios of the seven State Ministers (three </p><p>of whom are also Deputy Prime Ministers).  Following are the </p><p>portfolios of the three with economic policy </p><p>responsibilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State Minister and Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>Abdullatif Sener: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Directly supervises the State Planning Organization and </p><p>the Privatization Administration </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Reports to Cabinet on following independent agencies: </p><p>Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency; Capital Markets </p><p>Board; Turkish Development State Bank </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State Minister Ali Babacan: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Directly supervises the Treasury Undersecretariat </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Reports to Cabinet on following independent agencies: </p><p>Central Bank; Ziraat and Halk State Banks </p><p>State Minister Kursat Tuzmen: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Directly supervises the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat and </p><p>the Customs Undersecretariat </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Reports to Cabinet on following independent agency: </p><p>Turkish Ex-Im Bank </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
