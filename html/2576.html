<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000611 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, DAS BELLAMY; AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>CAPETOWN FOR A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/08/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DESPITE BEHIND THE SCENES SCHEMES, A PAN- </p><p>         AFRICAN ELECTION WHITEWASH UNLIKELY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 591 B) HARARE 603 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM REWHITEHEAD DUE TO 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) WE HAVE PICKED UP A NUMBER OF REPORTS THAT THERE </p><p>ARE MOVES AFOOT TO LINE UP AFRICAN ELECTION OBSERVATION </p><p>DELEGATIONS TO AGREE TO A COMMON POST-ELECTORAL </p><p>STATEMENT FAVORABLE TO ROBERT MUGABE.  DEPUTY ELECTIONS </p><p>SUPERVISION COMMISSIONER\'S NYIKAYARAMBA INVITATION TO </p><p>AFRICAN CHIEFS OF MISSION AND THE HEAD OF AFRICAN </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVATION DELEGATIONS TO A FOLLOW-UP MEETING </p><p>TO THE ESC PRE-ELECTION BRIEFING (REFTELS) TURNED OUT TO </p><p>BE AN INVITATION TO MEET WITH MDC LEADERSHIP, INCLUDING </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) REPORTS ON THE MEETING FROM CONTACTS WITHIN THE </p><p>AFRICAN DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY REVEAL THAT THERE ARE TWO </p><p>UNDERLYING CONCERNS AMONG MANY AFRICAN DELEGATES. </p><p>FIRST, THERE IS WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE OF THE ZANU-PF </p><p>CREDO THAT THE LAND ISSUE -- NOT THE RULE OF LAW OR THE </p><p>PRINCIPLE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGN WILL -- LIES AT THE HEART </p><p>OF THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  SECONDLY, THERE IS A FEELING </p><p>THAT THE MDC MAY NOT BE QUALIFIED TO TAKE UP THE REINS </p><p>OF POWER, REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICAL HANKERINGS OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DUKE LEFHOKO, HEAD OF THE SADC-PF DELEGATION AND </p><p>THUS FAR THE STRAIGHTEST SHOOTER OF THE AFRICAN MISSION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00611  01 OF 02  071508Z </p><p>HEADS, REPORTEDLY WARNED MDC BEFORE THE MEETING NOT TO </p><p>AGREE TO ANY CONDITIONS OFFERED BY THE AFRICAN GROUP. </p><p>IN FACT, THERE WAS REPORTEDLY A SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPT BY </p><p>CERTAIN DELEGATES TO GET TSVANGIRAI TO STATE THAT HE </p><p>WOULD ACCEPT THE ANNOUNCED OUTCOME, WHATEVER THIS MIGHT </p><p>BE, A POSITION THAT TSVANGIRAI WOULD NOT ACCEPT.  TWO </p><p>ANC MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION PRESSED </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ON EXACTLY THE SAME POINT DURING A PUBLIC MDC </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BRIEFING EARLY LAST WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE NDI\'S DENNIS KADEMA (PROTECT), WHO IS </p><p>ADVISING THE SADC-PF DELEGATION, INFORMED DCM ON MARCH 7 </p><p>THAT THE AU IS TAKING A VERY STRONG PRO-MUGABE STANCE. </p><p>A WOMAN FROM THE AU DELEGATION MET WITH SADC-PF SYG </p><p>MUTUKWA AND LEFHOKO EARLY THIS WEEK AND STRONGLY PRESSED </p><p>THEM TO AGREE TO SIGNING ON TO A JOINT, ALL-AFRICAN POST </p><p>ELECTORAL STATEMENT FAVORABLE TO MUGABE.  THEY REFUSED, </p><p>AND OTHER DELEGATIONS HAVE REPORTEDLY ALSO BALKED AT THE </p><p>NOTION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AFRICAN CONCERNS ABOUT LAND AND THE MDC\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO GOVERN DO NOT APPEAR TO REFLECT AN ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF ZANU-PF\'S SLASH AND BURN APPROACH TO ELECTIONEERING. </p><p>THE NIGERIANS AND SOUTH AFRICANS HAVE BOTH TOLD US THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF VIOLENCE AND BLATANT DISREGARD FOR THE RULES IS </p><p>APPALLING.  OTHER DELEGATIONS HAVE EXPRESSED SIMILAR </p><p>SENTIMENTS.  THREE DELEGATES FROM GHANA -- TWO MPS WHO </p><p>FORMERLY WERE IN OPPOSITION AND A WELL QUALIFIED </p><p>ELECTION COMMISSIONER -- DESCRIBED TO THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>THEIR REPULSION AT THE WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE, PROCEDURAL </p><p>WEAKNESSES, AND GOZ MEDIA DISTORTION.  HOWEVER, THEY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00611  01 OF 02  071508Z </p><p>INSISTED THAT THEY ARE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THEIR </p><p>INVITATION AND ARE UNABLE TO SPEAK OUT UNTIL AFTER THE </p><p>ELECTION IS DONE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT.  WE DO NOT THINK THAT ATTEMPTS TO FORGE </p><p>A PAN-AFRICAN, PRO-MUGABE POSITION WILL PREVAIL DESPITE </p><p>QUESTIONS BY SOME DELEGATIONS ABOUT THE LAND ISSUE AND </p><p>THE MDC\'S CAPACITY TO GOVERN (WHICH, WE NOTE, SHOULD IN </p><p>DEMOCRATIC TERMS BE THE BUSINESS OF THE ZIMBABWEANS AND </p><p>NO ONE ELSE).  AS NOTED IN EARLIER REPORTS, A NUMBER OF </p><p>AFRICAN BILATERAL DELEGATIONS -- AND CLEARLY THE AU -- </p><p>HAVE NOT COME HERE TO FIND FAULT WITH A MUGABE VICTORY, </p><p>HOWEVER THIS MAY BE OBTAINED.  HOWEVER, OUR </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF OTHER AFRICAN DELEGATIONS, </p><p>AND THE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE OF SOME OF THEIR OBSERVERS </p><p>IN THE FIELD AS REPORTED BY OUR OBSERVER TEAMS, LEAD US </p><p>TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER, MORE BALANCED </p><p>VOICES.  IN THE EVENT OF AN ANNOUNCED MUGABE VICTORY, </p><p>THE FINAL PUBLIC POSITIONS OF THE NIGERIANS AND THE </p><p>SOUTH AFRICANS WILL BE CRUCIAL TO WHETHER OR NOT THE </p><p>AFRICANS AT LARGE RETREAT TO THE UNFORTUNATE "QUIET </p><p>DIPLOMACY" OF AFRICAN SOLIDARITY THAT HAS TOO FREQUENTLY </p><p>PREVAILED IN THE PAST.
