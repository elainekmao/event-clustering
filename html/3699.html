WE WERE GETTING MORE COMFORTABLE WITH </p><p>EXCHANGING INFORMATION WITH PARTNER COUNTRIES BUT HAD TO DO A </p><p>BETTER JOB OF PROVIDING IT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN A </p><p>MANNER THAT DID NOT COMPROMISE SOURCES AND METHODS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) THE PM REPLIED THAT GOH INTEL OFFICIALS ALREADY </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN EXCHANGES WITH THE USG, BUT HE COULD SAFELY </p><p>SAY THAT IF THERE COULD BE EVEN CLOSER COOPERATION, IT WOULD </p><p>BE A PLEASURE TO OFFER IT.  THE GOH HAD A STRONG ANALYTICAL </p><p>CAPACITY, AND THE INTEL RELATIONSHIP WAS VERY GOOD AND VERY </p><p>PROFESSIONAL.

THERE WAS NO NEXUS AT </p><p>ALL BETWEEN USAMA BIN LADEN\'S TYPE OF TERROR AND POVERTY; </p><p>ELIMINATING POVERTY WORLDWIDE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A NOBLE GOAL, </p><p>BUT IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>=================================== </p><p>IRAQ:  GOH APPEAL FOR CONSULTATIONS </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) IN RESPONSE TO MEDQYESSY\'S QUESTION ON USG POLICY </p><p>TOWARD IRAQ, RIDGE NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD BEGUN </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>IN THE PAST WEEK, AND WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE IN HIS </p><p>FORTHCOMING UNGA SPEECH.  THESE ACTIONS WOULD HELP DISPEL THE </p><p>MISTAKEN SPECULATION ABOUT USG PLANS TO ACT UNILATERALLY. </p><p>RIDGE CAUTIONED THE PM NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO MEDIA </p><p>REPORTS OF DISAGREEMENTS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION.  AS </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL HAD SAID, SOME OF THE REPORTED DIFFERENCES </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WERE REAL, SOME PERCEIVED, AND SOME IMAGINARY.  THE PRESIDENT </p><p>WAS A DECISIVE LEADER WHO ENCOURAGED OTHERS TO EXPRESS </p><p>DIVERGENT VIEWS, BUT THERE WAS NO DISAGREEMENT AT ALL THAT </p><p>SADDAM\'S PURSUIT OF WMD CONSTITUTED A MENACE NOT JUST TO THE </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        ROME  04424  121327Z </p><p>U.S. BUT TO THE ENTIRE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) MEDQYESSY SAID HE EXPECTED SADDAM TO TRY AND BUY TIME </p><p>BY ALLOWING UN INSPECTORS BACK INTO IRAQ, ALTHOUGH HE DOUBTED </p><p>SADDAM WAS THINKING MUCH BEYOND THAT NEXT MOVE.  THE PM </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE TIMING OF USG CONSULTATIONS WITH ITS NATO </p><p>ALLIES ABOUT ANY USE OF FORCE WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT </p><p>ISSUE; AKOTS, WHO HAD NOT SAID A WORD UP TO THIS POINT, ADDED </p><p>EMPHATICALLY, "YOU ASKED HOW YOU COULD HELP US?  DON\'T TAKE </p><p>US BY SURPRISE."  GOVERNOR RIDGE AND CDA ASSURED MEDQYESSY </p><p>THAT THE CIRCLE OF CONSULTATION WOULD WIDEN BEYOND THE PERM </p><p>FIVE.  AKOTS SAID THE GOH REALIZED CONSULTATIONS WOULD </p><p>NATURALLY TAKE PLACE ON MANY LEVELS -- THE UN, NATO, </p><p>BILATERALLY -- AND HOPED THE USG RECOGNIZED THAT EACH SET OF </p><p>CONSULTATIONS SERVED A DISTINCT PURPOSE AND SO WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>BE APPROACHED DIFFERENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>12 (C) THE PM CONCLUDED THE DISCUSSION ON IRAQ BY TELLING </p><p>GOVERNOR RIDGE "WE ARE AND WILL BE RELIABLE PARTNERS; YOU CAN </p><p>COUNT ON US."
