<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001852 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/PPD; NEA/ARP; PA; IIP/G/NESA; NEA/EX; NEA/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  GETTING THE PRESIDENT\'S MESSAGE OUT: WINNING </p><p>MINDS, BUT NOT HEARTS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  SECSTATE 96192 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  TO GET THE PRESIDENT\'S MESSAGE OUT, THE </p><p>ABU DHABI PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION ENGAGED KEY UAE MEDIA </p><p>ON MULTIPLE LEVELS PRIOR TO AND DURING THE WAR.  PD </p><p>EFFORTS INCLUDED INTENSIVE TARGETED OUTREACH WITH KEY </p><p>PUBLIC DIPLOMACY MATERIALS, ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATIONS </p><p>WITH UAE NATIONALS, ARAB EXPATRIATES, AND LOCAL IRAQIS, </p><p>AND AMBASSADORIAL PRESS ROUNDTABLES.  DUE TO WIDESPREAD </p><p>ARAB OPPOSITION TO THE WAR, SUCCESS IN BUILDING SUPPORT </p><p>FOR U.S. POLICY IN THE REGION WILL BE MEASURED BY WHAT </p><p>WE DO IN THE FUTURE: HOW WELL WE ARE ABLE TO HELP BUILD </p><p>A DEMOCRATIC IRAQ, MOVE THE PEACE PROCESS FORWARD, AND </p><p>WITHDRAW OUR TROOPS FROM THE REGION.  WHILE GRAPHIC </p><p>IMAGES ON TELEVISION AND IN PRINT MEDIA HAVE STOKED ANTI- </p><p>AMERICAN FEELINGS, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR COLLECTIVE PD </p><p>EFFORTS HAVE NONETHELESS HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR </p><p>AUDIENCES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOR THE LAST MONTH AND MORE, THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS </p><p>SECTION IN ABU DHABI ENGAGED KEY UAE MEDIA, ACADEMIC, </p><p>AND GOVERNMENT INTERLOCUTORS IN A VARIETY OF MEANS, AND </p><p>CONTINUES TO DO SO.  THESE EFFORTS SUPPORTED OBJECTIVE </p><p>VOICES IN THE DEBATE AND HELPED PRESENT MORE BALANCED </p><p>REPORTING.  THEY INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>- AMBASSADORIAL PRESS ROUNDTABLES WITH UAE ELECTRONIC </p><p>AND PRINT MEDIA IN ABU DHABI AND DUBAI, WITH A </p><p>PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE ARAB SATELLITE MEDIA; </p><p>--INTENSIVE EFFORTS TO HELP ABU DHABI TV GET IMBEDDED </p><p>WITH COALITION TROOPS AND GET ACCESS TO ACCURATE WAR </p><p>FOOTAGE TO COUNTER AL-JAZEERA; </p><p>- A NEW EMAIL LISTSERV THROUGH WHICH PAS DISSEMINATED </p><p>KEY POLICY STATEMENTS, POSITIVE PHOTOGRAPHS, WASHINGTON </p><p>FILE ARTICLES, AND OTHER PD ITEMS TO IMPORTANT MEDIA, </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND ACADEMIC CONTACTS DAILY; </p><p>- AN SMS TEXT MESSAGING SERVICE THROUGH WHICH PAS </p><p>NOTIFIED KEY CONTACTS OF ITEMS MENTIONED ABOVE; </p><p>- FREQUENT MEETINGS BY PAS STAFF WITH KEY JOURNALISTS, </p><p>IRAQI AND ARAB EXPATRIATES, UAE NATIONALS, AND OTHER </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS TO DISCUSS PUBLIC OPINION AND TO SOLICIT </p><p>INPUT ON HOW TO SHAPE OUR MESSAGE; </p><p>- DAILY MEDIA REACTION REPORTING; </p><p>- DAILY IRAQ PD TASKFORCE REPORTING; </p><p>- PAS STAFF UPDATED EMBASSY WEBSITE DAILY WITH IMPORTANT </p><p>POLICY STATEMENTS, KEY SPEECHES, IMPORTANT PD DOCUMENTS, </p><p>AND POSITIVE PHOTOGRAPHS. </p><p>- PLANNING A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY </p><p>ARMITAGE FOR AL-KHALEEJ ARABIC DAILY, THE MOST ANTI- </p><p>AMERICAN UAE DAILY, SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 18. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE CHALLENGES REMAIN MANY.  FIRST, WE COMMEND THE </p><p>IRAQ PD TASKFORCE AND STATE FOR TIMELY ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>PROVIDING A WEALTH OF KEY PD MATERIALS.  THE IRAQ PD </p><p>TASKFORCE FOLLOWED UP SWIFTLY ON POST\'S REQUESTS AND </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS WITH DOD, CENTCOM, AND USAID; THE TURN- </p><p>AROUND WAS EXTRAORDINARY.  TO FURTHER IMPROVE THIS </p><p>EFFORT, WE RECOMMEND THAT KEY STATE OFFICIALS CONTINUE </p><p>CURRENT PRESS OUTREACH EFFORTS WITH ARABIC TRANSLATIONS </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL MEDIA PLACEMENT. </p><p>LIKEWISE, MORE ARABIC TRANSLATIONS ARE NEEDED THE SAME </p><p>DAY OF IMPORTANT SPEECHES AND FOR IMPORTANT PD </p><p>DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS MISINFORMATION/DISINFORMATION </p><p>REPORTS, PHOTOGRAPH CAPTIONS, AND TALKING POINTS FOR </p><p>POST PRINCIPALS.  POSTS HAVE HAD TO TRANSLATE THESE </p><p>LOCALLY, WITH INADEQUATE TIME AND STAFF. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN THIS EMOTIONAL CLIMATE, SYMBOLIC IMAGES AND </p><p>GESTURES TAKE ON EVEN MORE IMPORTANCE THAN USUAL. </p><p>IMAGES OF THE RAISING OF AN AMERICAN FLAG, THE LOOTING </p><p>OF THE BAGHDAD MUSEUM, OR THE BURNING OF THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>IRAQI LIBRARIES ARE DEEPLY DISTURBING TO OUR AUDIENCES </p><p>IN THE UAE.  THEY PLAY INTO POPULAR FEARS THAT OUR TRUE </p><p>AIM IS TO SUBJUGATE AND HUMILIATE THE ARABS AND DESTROY </p><p>IRAQ\'S NATIONAL IDENTITY.  VISIBLE GESTURES SUCH AS THE </p><p>PROMPT DISPATCH OF A TEAM OF ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND </p><p>CONSERVATIONISTS TO IRAQ TO SALVAGE REMAINING </p><p>ANTIQUITIES WOULD RESONATE WITH OUR AUDIENCES MORE THAN </p><p>OFFICIAL STATEMENTS THAT WE ARE DOING ALL WE CAN.  IN </p><p>THE WORDS OF ONE IRAQI EXPATRIATE, "JUSTICE MUST BE SEEN </p><p>TO BE DONE, NOT JUST DONE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  OUR SUCCESS IN GETTING THE PRESIDENT\'S MESSAGE OUT </p><p>SO FAR HAS BEEN LINKED TO THE EMOTIVE IMAGES UAE </p><p>NATIONALS AND ARAB EXPATRIATES SEE THROUGH ARAB </p><p>ELECTRONIC AND PRINT MEDIA.  FOOTAGE OF DEAD OR WOUNDED </p><p>IRAQI CIVILIANS AND DEMOLISHED PALESTINIAN HOMES </p><p>GENERATED OUTRAGE AND REDUCED THE IMPACT OF OUR MESSAGE. </p><p>DESPITE THIS, TARGETED PLACEMENT OF KEY PD ITEMS, ONE-ON- </p><p>ONE INTERACTION WITH KEY INTERLOCUTORS, AND </p><p>AMBASSADORIAL OUTREACH HAVE ENSURED OUR VOICE WAS HEARD. </p><p>ALTHOUGH EMOTIONS HERE WILL CONTINUE TO RISE AND FALL </p><p>TOGETHER WITH DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ AND ISRAEL, MORE </p><p>THOUGHTFUL MINDS ARE INCREASINGLY CONNECTING COALITION </p><p>ACTIONS TO BUILD A DEMOCRATIC IRAQ TO THE HOPE OF A </p><p>BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
