(U) ON JUNE 19, THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\' UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY FOR EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS JONATHAN WUTAWUNASHE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CONVOKED POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF TO DELIVER A LETTER FROM </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE TO SECRETARY POWELL.  THE SIGNED </p><p>ORIGINAL HAS BEEN POUCHED TO AF/S.  THE TEXT OF THE LETTER </p><p>FOLLOWS BELOW: </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p>18 JUNE, 2001 </p><p> </p><p>MR. SECRETARY </p><p> </p><p>I WISH TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR EFFORTS TO RAISE THE PROFILE OF </p><p>AFRICA BY VISITING SOME AFRICAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THOSE </p><p>IN OUR SUB-REGION, SO EARLY IN THE LIFE OF THE PRESENT U.S. </p><p>ADMINISTRATION. YOUR VISIT WOULD, OF COURSE, HAVE BEEN MOST </p><p>WELCOME, HAD YOUR SCHEDULE ALLOWED YOU TO VISIT ZIMBABWE </p><p>BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE ENABLED YOU TO FORM FIRST HAND </p><p>IMPRESSIONS OF THE CHARACTER OF OUR NATION, ITS HISTORICAL </p><p>EXPERIENCES AND ASPIRATIONS.  IT WILL CERTAINLY BE MY </p><p>PLEASURE TO RECEIVE YOU SHOULD SUCH A VISIT BE IN PROSPECT. </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA WAS THE LAST FRONTIER IN THE EPIC STRUGGLE </p><p>FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE AFRICAN PEOPLE FROM THE BRUTAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01955  01 OF 02  221832Z </p><p>SCOURGES OF COLONIALISM, DISPOSSESSION AND MARGINALISATION. </p><p>IT STILL BEARS THE SCARS OF THAT STRUGGLE, AND IN MANY WAYS </p><p>IT STILL HAS TO RESOLVE MANY UNFINISHED ASPECTS OF THAT </p><p>STRUGGLE, ESPECIALLY IN THE REALM OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC JUSTICE </p><p>FOR ALL ITS PEOPLE.  BUT THERE IS STIFF RESISTANCE, BOTH </p><p>INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL, ESPECIALLY ON SUCH ISSUES AS LAND </p><p>REFORM IN ZIMBABWE.  WE HAVE WITNESSED A VIGOROUS </p><p>DELIBERATE OBFUSCATION OF THIS STRUGGLE FOR EQUITY FROM </p><p>CERTAIN QUARTERS ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE THROUGH THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF EXTRANEOUS ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>THOSE OPPOSED TO THE STRUGGLE HAVE RESORTED TO A CAMPAIGN </p><p>OF DISTORTION OF THE FACTS ON THE LAND REFORM PROGRAMME IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AND ARE BUSY CARICATURING OUR LEADERS WHO ARE </p><p>CHAMPIONING THAT CAUSE. UNFORTUNATELY, THESE DEMONISED </p><p>IMAGES OF OUR LEADERS, WHEN DISSEMINATED THROUGH SUCH A </p><p>POWERFUL CHANNEL AS THE GLOBAL MEDIA, HAVE TREMENDOUS </p><p>INFLUENCE IN THE SHAPING OF OPINIONS AT ALL LEVELS.  TODAY, </p><p>ZIMBABWE FINDS ITSELF A SUBJECT OF SUCH MANIPULATION, WHERE </p><p>THE VICTIM IS TURNED INTO THE VILLAIN. </p><p> </p><p>DURING THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE, PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE, </p><p>WHO LED THE FORCES THAT BROUGHT FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY AND THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW TO OUR COUNTRY AFTER YEARS OF ILLEGALITY AND </p><p>RACIST OPPRESSION, WAS THE TARGET OF SUCH A VICIOUS RACIST </p><p>SMEAR CAMPAIGN BY THE ADVERSARIES OF FREEDOM AND </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  THOSE SAME NEGATIVE FORCES HAVE NEVER </p><p>FORGIVEN HIM FOR HIS ROLE IN THE DEMISE OF THEIR HEGEMONY </p><p>AND HAVE NOW REGROUPED AND SEIZED ON HIS EFFORTS TO EFFECT </p><p>A FAIR AND JUST LAND REFORM TO ORCHESTRATE A VICIOUS AND </p><p>MALICIOUS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01955  01 OF 02  221832Z </p><p>FRUSTRATE HIS EFFORTS TO CORRECT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE </p><p>GROTESQUE AND SKEWED LAND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN THIS </p><p>COUNTRY, WHERE ONE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION (THE WHITE </p><p>COMMUNITY) OWNS 70% OF THE ARABLE LAND.  PERCEPTIONS ARE </p><p>BEING CREATED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE, WHOSE MANDATE THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE OVERWHELMINGLY RENEWED IN </p><p>SUCCESSIVE ELECTIONS HELD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION OF OUR COUNTRY AND ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE FREE AND </p><p>FAIR BY ALL, IS "REFUSING TO GO".  THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE IS SERVING A TERM OF OFFICE TO WHICH THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE ELECTED HIM, AND THAT THE SAME PEOPLE WILL, NEXT </p><p>YEAR, EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ELECT A </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THEIR CHOICE IS BEING CYNICALLY IGNORED. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS IN THE LIGHT OF THESE OBSERVATIONS THAT WE REGRETTED </p><p>THE FACT THAT COMMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO YOU, MR. SECRETARY, </p><p>DURING YOUR RECENT VISIT TO SOUTH AFRICA APPEARED NOT TO BE </p><p>ENRICHED WITH THIS ZIMBABWEAN PERSPECTIVE. IT OCCURS TO ME </p><p>NOW THAT PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THE SENSE OF SHOCKED </p><p>SURPRISE THAT WAS EXPERIENCED HERE AND ELSEWHERE WHEN WE, </p><p>AS THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT IN THIS COUNTRY, HEARD THOSE </p><p>COMMENTS, HAD WE SOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH </p><p>THE INFORMATION ON THE REALITIES AND ASPIRATIONS OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND ITS PEOPLE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, PRIOR TO YOUR </p><p>VISIT TO THE REGION, ESPECIALLY AS WE WERE AWARE THAT YOU </p><p>HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO INCLUDE ZIMBABWE IN YOUR ITINERARY </p><p>THIS TIME ROUND.  SINCE ZIMBABWE IS COMMITTED TO </p><p>MAINTAINING A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH YOUR COUNTRY, WE </p><p>HAVE NOT ALLOWED OUR DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THOSE COMMENTS TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HARARE  01955  01 OF 02  221832Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9949 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01955  02 OF 02  221838Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  CPR-02 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSC-01   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------FC8129  221839Z /38 </p><p>O 191504Z JUN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9138 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001955 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y (CLASS BY ADDEED ON SECT 01) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, OPDC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  LETTER FROM ZIMBABWEAN FM MUDENGE TO SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01955  02 OF 02  221838Z </p><p> </p><p>AFFECT OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS AND I AM, THEREFORE, AT YOUR </p><p>DISPOSAL FOR AN EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND VIEWS ON THIS </p><p>AND OTHER TOPICS IN KEEPING WITH THE LONG-STANDING GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE ACCEPT, MR. SECRETARY, THE ASSURANCES OF MY HIGHEST </p><p>CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>/S/ </p><p> </p><p>I.S.G. MUDENGE </p><p>MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE SUBSTANCE OF FM MUDENGE\'S LETTER -- PORTRAYING </p><p>ZIMBABWE AS A VICTIM OF EXTERNAL PREDATORS -- IS CONSISTENT </p><p>WITH THE REFRAIN THAT WE REGULARLY HEAR FROM SENIOR </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN OFFICIALS.  THAT SAID, HOWEVER, WE CONSIDER IT A </p><p>POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT THAT MUDENGE HAS DECIDED TO REACH OUT </p><p>TO SECRETARY POWELL.  TAKEN TOGETHER, THE MUDENGE LETTER, </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S RECENT WARM MESSAGE OF CONGRATULATIONS </p><p>TO BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR ON HIS ELECTION </p><p>VICTORY, AND INDICATIONS THAT HARARE MIGHT HAVE MOVED </p><p>TOWARD ACCEPTING AN "INVESTIGATORY" MISSION OF THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH MINISTERIAL ACTION GROUP (CMAG), SUGGEST THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE MIGHT BE CHANGING TACTICS </p><p>SLIGHTLY IN ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY.  WE ARE NOT CONVINCED, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01955  02 OF 02  221838Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO MOVE BEYOND APPEARANCES AND LIP </p><p>SERVICE TO ADDRESS GENUINELY THE CRITICAL ISSUES OF </p><p>CONCERN TO ZIMBABWE\'S NEIGHBORS AND THE BROADER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  WE WOULD RECOMMEND A RESPONSE </p><p>FROM SECRETARY POWELL THAT WELCOMES MUDENGE\'S INTEREST IN </p><p>MAINTAINING AN OPEN DIALOGUE BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, BUT </p><p>WHICH EMPHASIZES OUR SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASING </p><p>LAWLESSNESS AND RAPID ECONOMIC DECLINE.  SUCH A RESPONSE </p><p>MIGHT EMPHASIZE THAT THE USG EXPECTS THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO BE FREE AND FAIR, LAY OUT </p><p>PRECISELY WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT, AND MAKE CLEAR WHAT THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES WILL BE FOR OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP IF </p><p>THOSE STANDARDS ARE NOT ADHERED TO. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
