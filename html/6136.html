<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001419 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: PARLIAMENT FEELING ITS OATS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1350 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 808 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (C) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Building on the March 1 defeat of the government </p><p>proposal regarding U.S. and Turkish troop deployments to Iraq </p><p>(reftel), Parliamentary leaders and other influential M.P.s </p><p>are sketching out an ambitious agenda that will, if carried </p><p>out, aggrandize the institution and make it a more permanent, </p><p>and independently powerful, policymaking organ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Emin Sirin, Deputy Chairman of the Parliament\'s Foreign </p><p>Affairs Committee (and a notorious "no" voter on March 1), </p><p>characterized the vote to us on March 4 as marking the rise </p><p>of Parliament and the emergence of an "understanding" with </p><p>the opposition CHP.  As a result, Parliament is preparing </p><p>constitutional amendments that will enhance its ability to </p><p>act more independently of the government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Salih Kapusuz, the powerful AK Parliamentary Group Deputy </p><p>Chief, elaborated on March 5 that the constitutional and </p><p>other legal changes now quietly being prepared by AK include </p><p>promoting: 1) greater "real" Parliamentary oversight of GOT </p><p>decisionmaking and areas, such as military budgeting, long </p><p>left relatively free from civilian scrutiny; and 2) greater </p><p>local-level government control of its own activities. </p><p>Kapusuz described the AK vision as one that would help </p><p>transform Parliament into something more along the lines of </p><p>the U.S. Congress in its power to set and control the </p><p>legislative agenda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turhan Comez, AK leader Erdogan\'s former Chef de Cabinet </p><p>and now an M.P. representing Balikesir, noted to us March 5 </p><p>that Parliament has "self-promoted" its role since the Nov. 3 </p><p>elections.  He intimated that, given AK\'s huge majority and </p><p>the fact that there is no national election necessary until </p><p>2007, M.P.s are freer now than ever before to act as they see </p><p>fit.  "The culture of one-man rule over a party is beginning </p><p>to change," Comez added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Opposition CHP polling guru and senior M.P. Bulent Tanla </p><p>told us March 5 that "this marked the first time in recent </p><p>memory that discipline in a dominant party had broken down." </p><p>(Fellow CHPer Emin Koc noted that this unravelling was due in </p><p>part to non-party organizations -- the tarikats -- that </p><p>provisionally support AK.)  Years from now, Tanla predicted, </p><p>people will look back on March 1 as "the beginning" of </p><p>Parliament\'s ascendancy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Some legislators are clearly feeling their oats since </p><p>the Parliament\'s ambitious Speaker, Bulent Arinc, helped </p><p>engineer the failure of the Government\'s March 1 proposal. </p><p>While that foray in power politics was in part an intramural </p><p>affair aimed at rival elements within the AK Party apparatus, </p><p>it was clearly a watershed in Turkish legislative history. </p><p>Whether this new independent streak can be sustained is an </p><p>open question of considerable significance.  This is so </p><p>particularly given: 1) what we expect will be the eventual </p><p>anti-Arinc counterattack from Erdogan, Gul or both; and 2) </p><p>the almost certain negative reaction (particularly involving </p><p>military budgeting) to such a parliamentary power play by a </p><p>TGS already viscerally opposed to AK and to Arinc. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
