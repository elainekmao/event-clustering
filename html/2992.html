(C)  The talks between ZANU-PF and the MDC have collapsed </p><p>for now, as President Mugabe insisted the ruling party would </p><p>not participate until after the courts rule on the </p><p>opposition\'s legal challenge of the presidential election </p><p>results.  MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai subsequently declared </p><p>that mass action is now unavoidable and inevitable since the </p><p>population is "combative and defiant" and refused to </p><p>recognize Mugabe\'s legitimacy.  The objective of mass action </p><p>would be to make the country ungovernable and force a new </p><p>election, but an MDC advisor said the party needed at least </p><p>six more months to lay sufficient groundwork for such an </p><p>effort to be successful.  An independent political analyst </p><p>thought that the MDC would not be able to sustain effective </p><p>mass action and should concentrate instead on strengthening </p><p>its own structures, devising appealing policy alternatives, </p><p>and intensifying efforts to build bridges to the continent, </p><p>particulary to South Africa.  Taking these steps, while </p><p>letting food shortages and economic decline take their </p><p>inevitable toll on the current government, might be the best </p><p>of Tsvangirai\'s narrowing options.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Interparty talks collapse </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  After several days of energetic attempts by the </p><p>South African and Nigerian facilitators to jump start the </p><p>nascent dialogue between ZANU-PF and the MDC, it appears that </p><p>the talks have collapsed before they ever really began.  As </p><p>reported in reftels, the ruling party requested a suspension </p><p>of the dialogue (which had, to date, produced only an </p><p>agreement on agenda items) until the MDC\'s legal challenge of </p><p>the election results was completed, and President Mugabe </p><p>refused to budge from this position in a subsequent </p><p>discussion with the facilitators.  We understand that MDC </p><p>leader Morgan Tsvangirai plans to phone Nigerian President </p><p>Obasanjo, presumably to follow up on the latter\'s promise to </p><p>travel to Harare personally to ensure continuation of the </p><p>dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Prominent political analyst (and occasional advisor </p><p>to the MDC leadership)Brian Raftopoulos told us that the MDC </p><p>needs the talks more than the ruling party.  The dialogue </p><p>gives the MDC visibility, and the longer the opposition party </p><p>is out of the public spotlight, the more they lose </p><p>credibility and relevance. </p><p> </p><p>Mass action "inevitable" </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In a May 18 interview with an independent weekly </p><p>newspaper, MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai said mass action </p><p>now appears to be the only feasible alternative left for the </p><p>opposition party.  "We have come to a stage where non-violent </p><p>action has to be taken.  It is evident that mass action is </p><p>unavoidable.  It is now inevitable."   He reiterated some of </p><p>the points that he made with us on May 14 (reftel), namely </p><p>that the party has engaged in nationwide consultations on the </p><p>way forward, and that the mood around the country is </p><p>"combative and defiant."  He implied that, ultimately, the </p><p>achievement of peaceful change depends upon Zimbabweans </p><p>themselves, not on the international community. Throwing down </p><p>the rhetorical gauntlet, Tsvangirai insisted that "The people </p><p>are refusing to accept Mugabe as their president and as a </p><p>responsible leadership we are going to channel their emotions </p><p>in a positive way that will resolve the crisis this country </p><p>is in." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Gandi Mudzingwa, Tsvangirai\'s special advisor, told </p><p>us on May 21 that the objective of mass action would be to </p><p>make the country ungovernable, and create an imperative for </p><p>an election rerun by forcing Mugabe from office.  Sufficient </p><p>groundwork, however, has not yet been laid for mass action to </p><p>be successful, according to Mudzingwa.  Although the party </p><p>had completed consultations with its own structures around </p><p>the country, it had only just begun to confer with </p><p>broad-based civic organizations -- such as the Zimbabwe </p><p>Congress of Trade Unions and the Zimbabwe National Students </p><p>Association -- whose participation would be critical to the </p><p>success of such an endeavor.  In addition, the MDC must also </p><p>concentrate on demoralizing members of the armed forces, </p><p>reducing their inclination to fire on protestors, a factor </p><p>which will depend in large measure on the passage of time, as </p><p>the economy continues to deteriorate and affects soldiers and </p><p>their families.  Mudzingwa estimated that the party would not </p><p>be ready to launch mass action for at least six months. </p><p>Asked whether Tsvangirai agreed with that assessment or was </p><p>inclined to act much sooner, Mudzingwa said it was unclear, </p><p>and that the MDC leader is under tremendous pressure to act. </p><p>In a separate conversation, MDC Member of Parliament David </p><p>Coltart told us some form of limited mass action was </p><p>necessary, as it would send a signal to the region and </p><p>international community of continuing unhappiness with the </p><p>election outcome.  He thought the party could and should shut </p><p>down the country for two days, but that anything longer than </p><p>that would be unsustainable and would simply play into </p><p>Mugabe\'s hands. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Raftopoulos maintained that the MDC currently does </p><p>not have the muscle to mount effective mass action.  The </p><p>ruling party, he said, has succeeded in neutralizing </p><p>influential civic groups that are key to a successful </p><p>mobilization effort and has the MDC and its leadership very </p><p>much on the ropes.  An attempt to organize a broad-based and </p><p>sustained anti-government campaign would, therefore, almost </p><p>certainly fail, and lead the GOZ to engage in a no-holds </p><p>barred effort to crush the opposition leadership. </p><p>Raftopoulos thought Tsvangirai might go for broke, anyway, </p><p>since he is under enormous pressure to channel the anger of </p><p>his supporters and demonstrate the party\'s capacity to </p><p>deliver, but the consequences of failure are very high.  In </p><p>order to avoid erosion of its influence and bargaining power, </p><p>Raftopoulos believes the MDC must concentrate on </p><p>strengthening its organizational structures, regularly devise </p><p>dynamic policy positions, particularly on land, maintain its </p><p>international stature as a credible alternative to ZANU-PF, </p><p>and intensify efforts to build political bridges on the </p><p>continent, particulary with South Africa. </p><p> </p><p>Mugabe to "deal with" the MDC </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Meanwhile, President Mugabe\'s remarks on May 15 to a </p><p>national gathering of ZANU-PF youth made clear that the MDC </p><p>must tread very carefully.  Using the truculent language </p><p>typical of his rantings against his political opposition, </p><p>Mugabe said his government would not tolerate further </p><p>"nonsense and rubbish" from the MDC.  He warned that "if they </p><p>choose violence, then we will deal with them effectively," </p><p>and described the organization of mass action as a "dangerous </p><p>undertaking" that would not be tolerated.   The President </p><p>once again cautioned Zimbabweans against allowing the </p><p>assumption of power by a party he claimed is funded and </p><p>manipulated by the British. </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Morgan Tsvangirai\'s latitude for maneuver is </p><p>narrowing.  He faces on one side large numbers of disgruntled </p><p>supporters who are fed up with ZANU-PF\'s economic </p><p>mismanagement and lawlessness and are leaning heavily on the </p><p>MDC to do something to extricate them from increasing misery. </p><p> Failure in the near term to demonstrate that the party is a </p><p>force to be reckoned with could relegate it to irrelevance. </p><p>At the same time, President Mugabe knows that large-scale </p><p>demonstrations could quickly get out of hand and lead to </p><p>consequences he cannot control.  We have no doubt, therefore, </p><p>that he will use all necessary force to crush demonstrations </p><p>even before they begin.  Under these circumstances, we doubt </p><p>there is a critical mass of people willing to risk their </p><p>necks without some realistic possibility it would lead to </p><p>positive change, an outcome which Tsvangirai cannot </p><p>guarantee. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The MDC leader thus finds himself in a box with few </p><p>good policy options.  His best course of action may be simply </p><p>to bide his time, focusing on strengthening his party </p><p>organizationally and staying in the public spotlight by </p><p>holding regular rallies and proposing appealing, realistic </p><p>policy alternatives to those being pursued by ZANU-PF.  In </p><p>the meantime, worsening food shortages and continued economic </p><p>deterioration will generate their own pressures on the </p><p>current regime, making Mugabe\'s position domestically and in </p><p>the region increasingly untenable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
