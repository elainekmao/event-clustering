<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001982 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-23-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Peace Process Update:  Norwegian envoy visits; </p><p>LTTE official meets leaders; Epicenter of Muslim anger </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1975, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process reviews </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister visits north and </p><p>south in run-up to second round of talks </p><p> </p><p>-- Senior Tiger negotiator Balasingham continues </p><p>consultations with leadership </p><p> </p><p>-- New poll highlights strong support for peace process, </p><p>as well as ethnic divisions </p><p> </p><p>-- The Flavor of the Peace Process:  Akkaraipattu, the </p><p>epicenter of the Muslim meltdown in the east </p><p> </p><p>====================== </p><p>Norwegian Envoy Visits </p><p>====================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Vidar </p><p>Helgesen is now in Sri Lanka for an October 20-24 visit. </p><p>During the trip, Helgesen, the chief of the Norwegian </p><p>peace facilitation effort, will be making stops </p><p>throughout the island, including Colombo for meetings </p><p>with GSL officials and the Wanni region in the north for </p><p>meetings with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE).  In a first during one of his periodic visits, </p><p>Helgesen also visited Sri Lanka\'s deep south.  In </p><p>visiting the southern district of Hambantota on October </p><p>20, Helgesen called attention to Norway\'s long-term </p><p>interest in development of the south.  Before proceeding </p><p>to the Wanni region to meet LTTE leader Prabhakaran and </p><p>senior negotiator Balasingham (see below), Helgesen also </p><p>stopped in Jaffna on October 22. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In making the visit, Norwegian Embassy political </p><p>officer Tomas Stangeland told us that Helgesen has three </p><p>major objectives:  (1) To set up an agenda for the </p><p>second round of peace talks slated to take place in </p><p>Thailand from October 31 - November 3; (2) To make </p><p>progress in forming a GSL-LTTE "Joint Task Force" on </p><p>humanitarian issues; and (3) To cement plans for a </p><p>conference of donors that will be held in Oslo in late </p><p>November.  Helgesen also planned to discuss the ongoing </p><p>LTTE-Muslim tensions in the east. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  As reviewed by Stangeland, Helgesen\'s </p><p>agenda is quite an ambitious one, with the Norwegians </p><p>having to accomplish a lot in very little time.  The </p><p>idea of sending Helgesen to southern Sri Lanka was a </p><p>solid one and garnered him good press.  Amid the </p><p>discussion about assisting the war-torn north and east, </p><p>many Sinhalese want to make sure that the underdeveloped </p><p>south is not forgotten and Helgesen effectively made </p><p>that point.  (Note:  Not everyone was impressed; a group </p><p>of demonstrators from the anti-peace process Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna came out to protest against Helgesen </p><p>during the Hambantota stop.)  (Note:  We have heard that </p><p>Helgesen is annoyed that President Kumaratunga could not </p><p>meet him because of a "busy schedule.")  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>======================================= </p><p>Senior Tiger Official Meets his Leaders </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Since arriving in Sri Lanka on October 15 (see </p><p>Reftels), the LTTE\'s London-based senior negotiator </p><p>Anton Balasingham has reportedly been engaged in </p><p>numerous meetings with his leadership.  Tamil contacts </p><p>have told us that Balasingham has held long meetings </p><p>with LTTE leader Prabhakaran and political chief Thamil </p><p>Chelvan about the peace process.  (Note:  Thamil Chelvan </p><p>is reportedly planning to participate in the next round </p><p>of talks.)  The press has also reported that Balasingham </p><p>has met with LTTE "Sea Tiger" commander Soosai and other </p><p>military wing officials, including Colonel Banu.  There </p><p>is no indication whether Balasingham has met with LTTE </p><p>leaders from the east, such as Paduman from the </p><p>Trincomalee area, and Karuna from the Batticaloa/Ampara </p><p>area.  Balasingham\'s wife, Adele, an Australian national </p><p>who is a member of the LTTE, has also been engaged in </p><p>meetings focused on women\'s issues. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT.  Little is known about the LTTE\'s inner </p><p>dynamics, but Balasingham is considered by most </p><p>observers to be more in favor of the peace process than </p><p>some others in the group.  Apropos of this point, most </p><p>of Balasingham\'s meetings seem to have been held in the </p><p>town of Mullaitivu where much of the military leadership </p><p>is believed to spend time, as opposed to Kilinochchi, </p><p>the nominal headquarters of the LTTE.  This may indicate </p><p>that he is lobbying military officials, some of whom are </p><p>reportedly very concerned about the direction of the </p><p>peace process.  It would be positive if he also met </p><p>members of the eastern leadership, as it is from that </p><p>area where many problems arise, especially with Muslims </p><p>(see Paras 9-10, for example).  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>Poll re Peace Process </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The latest tracking poll by the Center for </p><p>Policy Alternatives (CPA), a well-regarded local think- </p><p>tank, reported the following key findings: </p><p> </p><p>- Overwhelming public support for the peace process </p><p>continues. </p><p>- A majority of Sri Lankans continue to approve of </p><p>Norway\'s role as peace facilitator. </p><p>- There has been a steady decline in the belief that the </p><p>LTTE "goes in for talks to fool the people." </p><p>- There has been a steady increase in the number of </p><p>people who believe that the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission </p><p>(SLMM) is not "effective."  Many Sinhalese hold this </p><p>view, while Tamils generally do not. </p><p>- The vast majority of Tamils say that the LTTE is the </p><p>"sole representative" of the Tamil community, an </p><p>assertion rejected by most Sinhalese. </p><p>- Most Sri Lankans do not believe that the LTTE should </p><p>be left in control of an interim administration set up </p><p>for the north and east.  The majority of Sinhalese and </p><p>Muslims are opposed to LTTE control, while most Tamils </p><p>are in favor. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  We are faxing the CPA poll results to SA/INS. </p><p>Mission will also provide SA/INS the results of a recent </p><p>poll it commissioned regarding Sri Lankans attitudes </p><p>toward the U.S.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  The poll\'s findings essentially </p><p>confirm what we have heard anecdotally, i.e., there is </p><p>widespread support for the peace process.  It has also </p><p>long been said that there is a chasm dividing Tamil and </p><p>Sinhalese perceptions, with the latter group somewhat </p><p>more skeptical toward the process mainly due to concerns </p><p>regarding the LTTE.  The poll tends to bear this out. </p><p>In any case, the poll indicates there is close to zero </p><p>support for a return to war even among the skeptics. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Muslim Meltdown in Akkaraipattu </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In this edition of the flavor of the peace </p><p>process, Mission turns the spotlight on the town of </p><p>Akkaraipattu in the eastern district of Ampara.  Of </p><p>late, Akkaraipattu has been the epicenter of much of the </p><p>anger that many eastern Muslims feel toward the peace </p><p>process (see Reftels).  (Note:  Akkaraipattu has about </p><p>35,000 residents of which over 90 percent are Muslim.) </p><p>Earlier in the month, for example, fighting broke out </p><p>between police and Tamils near the town leaving seven </p><p>dead.  This incident led to Muslim and Tamil clashes in </p><p>the town.  In addition, after Muslims were abducted </p><p>purportedly by the LTTE, clashes broke out on the </p><p>outskirts of the town between Muslims and Tamils last </p><p>week, which led the government to impose a curfew for </p><p>several days.  There has also reportedly been some </p><p>Muslim extremist activity in the area, including reports </p><p>that A.L.M. Athaullah, an MP from Akkaraipattu, was </p><p>involved in stirring things up.  (Note:  Athaullah has </p><p>recently been at odds with the leader of his party, Rauf </p><p>Hakeem of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, over the peace </p><p>process -- see Reftel.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT:  Clues as to why Akkaraipattu is so </p><p>tense are not hard to find.  The town is surrounded by </p><p>Tamil communities, leaving the pocket of Muslims in </p><p>Akkaraipattu feeling isolated and vulnerable.  When </p><p>Mission team visited the town in June, it met with many </p><p>Muslims who were extremely worried that the government\'s </p><p>peace initiative was a "sell out" to the LTTE (see </p><p>Reftels).  Despite the government\'s best efforts, every </p><p>indication is that this feeling is stronger than ever. </p><p>In an October 23 meeting, for example, Chandra Nehru, a </p><p>Tamil National Alliance MP from near the town, told us </p><p>that the situation in the Akkaraipattu area remained </p><p>extremely tense and was even explosive.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
