(C) THE VATICAN ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 28 THAT IT HAS </p><p> INVITED THE LEADERS OF THE DIFFERENT CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES </p><p> IN THE HOLY LAND TO A MEETING ON DECEMBER 13. THE VATICAN </p><p> PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT CATEGORIZES THE MEETING AS PURELY </p><p> "PASTORAL" IN NATURE. </p><p> </p><p> 2. (C) DCM SPOKE WITH HIS ISRAELI COUNTERPART NOVEMBER 29. </p><p> ISRAELI DCM SAID THAT HIS EMBASSY HAS DISCOVERED THAT THE </p><p> MEETING IS BEING ORGANIZED BY THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, </p><p> AND NOT ONE OF THE VATICAN COUNCILS (I.E. MINISTRIES) WHICH </p><p> WOULD NORMALLY BE INVOLVED IN RELIGIOUS/PASTORAL AFFAIRS. </p><p> IN ADDITION, THE ISRAELIS BELIEVE THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p> THE MEETING WAS MEANT TO COINCIDE WITH A DOCUMENT ISSUED BY </p><p> THE CHRISTIAN LEADERS IN ISRAEL AND THE TERRITORIES </p><p> CONDEMNING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NAZARETH MOSQUE. </p><p> </p><p> 3. (C) COMMENT: THE TIMING OF THIS MEETING, COUPLED WITH </p><p> THE VATICAN\'S REQUEST FOR A MEETING WITH SECRETARY POWELL </p><p> IS A STRONG INDICATION THAT THE VATICAN IS PREPARED TO </p><p> BEGIN ACTIVELY PUSHING WHAT IT CONSIDERS ITS INTERESTS IN </p><p> THE MEPP.  IT IS LIKELY THAT IT SEES AN OPENING CREATED BY </p><p> THE WAR ON TERRORISM TO PRESSURE THE ISRAELIS ON THE ISSUE </p><p> OF INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES FOR THE RELIGIOUS SHRINES.  IT </p><p> IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THAT FOREIGN MINISTER WILL RAISE THE </p><p> ISSUE OF THE NAZARETH MOSQUE WHEN HE MEETS THE SECRETARY ON </p><p> DECEMBER 4.
