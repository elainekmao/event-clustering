JAKARTA 15387, B. JAKARTA 15051, C. JAKARTA </p><p>14905, D. JAKARTA 14491 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>:SUMMARY </p><p>:------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  INDONESIAN NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF KUNARTO TOLD </p><p>REPORTERS DEC. 28 THAT CAPTURED EAST TIMOR GUERRILLA </p><p>LEADER JOSE "XANANA" GUSMAO WOULD BE TRIED ON A NUMBER OF </p><p>CRIMINAL CHARGES; HE DID NOT MENTION ANY CHARGES UNDER </p><p>THE ANTI-SUBVERSION LAW.  KUNARTO SAID THE TRIAL WOULD </p><p>PROBABLY BE HELD IN DILI AND WOULD BEGIN IN JANUARY IF </p><p>THE POLICE INVESTIGATION IS CONCLUDED ON SCHEDULE.  A </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER WITH THE INDONESIAN BAR ASSOCIATION </p><p>(IKADIN) TOLD EMBOFF GUSMAO\'S WIFE HAD DESIGNATED THE </p><p>INDONESIAN LEGAL AID INSTITUTE (LBH) TO DEFEND HER </p><p>HUSBAND, BUT LBH HAD SO FAR BEEN UNABLE TO INFORM GU"MAO </p><p>OF THIS.  THE LAWYER FEELS KUNARTO\'S ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>PROBABLY REFLECTS THE OFFICIAL GOI DETERMINATION </p><p>REGARDING CHARGES; WHEN HE VISITED POLICE HEADQUARTERS </p><p>TWO WEEKS AGO, A DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO CHARGE </p><p>GUSMAO WITH SUBVERSION WAS STILL PENDING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>POLICE CHIEF ANNOUNCES CHARGES </p><p>:----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  CHIEF OF THE INDONESIAN NATIONAL POLICE (POLRI) GEN. </p><p>(POL.) KUNARTO TOLD REPORTERS DEC. 28 THAT CAPTURED </p><p>FRETILIN LEADER GUSMAO WOULD BE CHARGED UNDER THE </p><p>INDONESIAN CRIMINAL CODE (KUHP).  ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS, KUNARTO SAID THE PRINCIPAL CHARGE AGAINST GUSMAO </p><p>WOULD BE FILED UNDER CHAPTER 106 OF KUHP (CONSPIRACY TO </p><p>PLACE ALL OR PART OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY UNDER THE </p><p>CONTROL OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OR TO SEPARATE PART OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL TERRITORY), WHICH REPORTEDLY CARRIES A </p><p>MAXIMUM PENALTY OF LIFE IN PRISON.  SUBSIDIARY CHARGES </p><p>WILL REPORTEDLY BE FILED UNDER CHAPTER 108 (ARMED </p><p>OPPOSITION TO INDONESIAN AUTHORITY) AND CHAPTER 110 OF </p><p>KUHP, AND UNDER EMERGENCY LAW NO. 12 OF 1951 (ILLEGAL </p><p>STOCKPILING OF FIREARMS).  PRESS REPORTS DID NOT MENTION </p><p>ANY REFERENCE BY KUNARTO TO CHARGES UNDER THE </p><p>ANTI-SUBVERSION LAW OF 1963. </p><p> </p><p>4.  KUNARTO ALSO WAS QUOTED AS SAYING GUSMAO WOULD </p><p>"PROBABLY" BE TRIED IN DILI, CONFIRMING EARLIER GOI </p><p>STATEMENTS.  PROVIDED THE ONGOING POLICE INVESTIGATION OF </p><p>GUSMAO IS CONCLUDED ON SCHEDULE, KUNARTO SAID, THE CASE </p><p>SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO PROSECUTORS SHORTLY, AND THE </p><p>TRIAL WOULD BEGIN IN JANUARY.  ASKED ABOUT PERMISSION TO </p><p>INTERVIEW GUSMAO, KUNARTO TOLD JOURNALISTS NOT JUST </p><p>ANYONE COULD MEET WITH THE FRETILIN LEADER, ADDING THERE </p><p>WERE ALSO PROBLEMS WITH LANGUAGE. </p><p> </p><p>:HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS SEEK ACCESS </p><p>:-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  FRANS HENDRA WINARTA, A PROMINENT HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER </p><p>WHO WAS PART OF THE IKADIN-LBH TEAM WHICH DEFENDED </p><p>TIMORESE TRIED FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THE DEMONSTRATION WHICH </p><p>PRECEDED THE KILLINGS IN DILI ON NOV. 12, 1991, AND A </p><p>SUBSEQUENT PROTEST IN JAKARTA, TOLD EMBOFF A FAX FROM </p><p>GUSMAO\'S WIFE IN AUSTRALIA HAD BEEN RECEIVED APPOINTING </p><p>LBH TO DEFEND HER HUSBAND.  ON THE BASIS OF THIS FAX, </p><p>WINARTA AND LAWYERS FROM LBH VISITED POLRI HEADQUARTERS </p><p>TWO WEEKS AGO IN A VAIN ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO </p><p>GUSMAO.  THEY WERE TOLD GUSMAO HAD ALREADY APPOINTED </p><p>ANOTHER ATTORNEY TO DEFEND HIM.  (PRESS REPORTS HAVE </p><p>MENTIONED SOEDJONO, A JAKARTA LAWYER, AS THE COUNSEL </p><p>PURPORTEDLY CHOSEN BY GUSMAO.)  ACCORDING TO WINARTA, </p><p>HOWEVER, LBH HAS RELIABLY CONFIRMED THAT GUSMAO HAS NOT </p><p>YET APPOINTED DEFENSE COUNSEL. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WINARTA SAID HE WAS TOLD AT THE TIME OF HIS VISIT TO </p><p>POLRI HEADQUARTERS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET </p><p>DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT TO CHARGE GUSMAO WITH SUBVERSION. </p><p>HE FEELS KUNARTO\'S STATEMENT AS REPORTED IN THE PRESS </p><p>PROBABLY REFLECTS THE GOI\'S DECISION ON THE MATTER. </p><p>WINARTA HAS HEARD GUSMAO WILL ALSO BE CHARGED WITH MURDER </p><p>(CHAPTER 338 OF KUHP).  HE DESCRIBED THE APPARENT </p><p>DECISION NOT TO FILE SUBVERSION CHARGES AS "FUNNY," </p><p>CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS IN DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>ALLEGEDLY "MASTERMINDED" BY GUSMAO WERE TRIED AND </p><p>CONVICTED OF SUBVERSION EARLIER THIS YEAR.  HE SPECULATED </p><p>THE GOI\'S DECISION WAS THE PRODUCT OF NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE GOI AND ANOTHER PARTY OR PARTIES, POSSIBLY </p><p>INCLUDING GUSMAO HIMSELF.  WINARTA SAID HE HOPES TO </p><p>REPRESENT GUSMAO IN HIS TRIAL BUT ADMITS LANGUAGE COULD </p><p>POSE DIFFICULTIES, SINCE HE SPEAKS NEITHER PORTUGUESE NOR </p><p>TETUN. </p><p> </p><p>:COMMENT </p><p>:------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  KUNARTO\'S ENUMERATION OF CHARGES AGAINST GUSMAO </p><p>APPEARS TO CONFIRM REPORTS THE FRETILIN LEADER WOULD BE </p><p>TRIED ONLY ON CRIMINAL CHARGES (REF C).  WINARTA\'S AND </p><p>LBH\'S DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING ACCESS TO GUSMAO, AND THE </p><p>APPARENT EFFORT TO DESIGNATE A DEFENSE COUNSEL FROM </p><p>OUTSIDE THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITY, ARE REMINISCENT OF </p><p>THE EARLY STAGES OF LAST SPRING\'S SUBVERSION TRIALS IN </p><p>DILI.  WINARTA HAS PROMISED TO KEEP US UP-TO-DATE ON </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS ON THIS FRONT, AND WE WILL CHECK IN WITH LBH </p><p>WHEN ITS MEMBERS RETURN FROM VACATION ON JAN. 4.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BARRY </p><p></p></div>
