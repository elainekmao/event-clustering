<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002685 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR DEPARTMENT, PLEASE PASS TO EXIM, USTDA, USAID, USTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EINV, ECON, ETRD, ECIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT </p><p>REGIONAL CAPITAL MARKET CLEARING SYSTEM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  In mid-August, Special Advisor for the </p><p>Department of the Treasury\'s Government Debt Issuance and </p><p>Management (GDIM) program, Thomas Briggs visited Nigeria, </p><p>presenting a proposal on the establishment of a regional </p><p>securities clearing and settlement facility for sub-Saharan </p><p>Africa to senior Government of Nigeria officials, private </p><p>sector leaders and senior U.S. mission personnel.  Briggs\' </p><p>model, AfriClear, would help open the door to the level of </p><p>capital in-flows necessary to spur greater private sector on </p><p>the continent.  Because the feasibility study for such a </p><p>clearing mechanism would require a high degree of cooperation </p><p>among relevant USG agencies, post strongly recommends that </p><p>State, USAID, Treasury, USTR, EXIM, and other relevant </p><p>offices consider this project as a priority item for further </p><p>development. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Thomas Briggs visited Nigeria during the week of August </p><p>18, 2002 to discuss with various stakeholders a proposal to </p><p>establish a regional securities clearing and settlement </p><p>facility for Sub-Saharan African countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   Briggs has dubbed the proposal Africlear.  It would </p><p>establish an international/regional clearing and settlement </p><p>facility for Africa, similar to Euroclear and Clearstream, </p><p>the international central securities depositories (ICSDs) </p><p>that serve the northern hemisphere international capital </p><p>markets.  The proposed system would be a capital markets </p><p>clearing and settlement facility operating across Africa to </p><p>provide access to African capital markets for investors from </p><p>the rest of the world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Briggs believes current technical barriers to capital </p><p>market development in Africa are not amenable to bilateral, </p><p>private or public sector solutions by any individual actor. </p><p>These technical barriers must be overcome to realize any hope </p><p>of cross-border liquidity and significant portfolio </p><p>investment inflows. The AfriClear initiative would ease the </p><p>way of capital flows into Africa, and lay the necessary </p><p>financial groundwork for the kind of private-sector led </p><p>growth experienced in Latin America and Southeast Asia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Nigeria as a Part of AfriClear </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Nigeria is one of three potential stakeholder countries </p><p>for the proposed facility.  It possesses the second largest </p><p>securities market in the region (after South Africa) and </p><p>could potentially contribute, along with South Africa, the </p><p>transactions volume that could make the facility </p><p>self-sustaining. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Furthermore, Nigeria, and especially President Olusegun </p><p>Obasanjo, are leaders of the New Partnership for Africa,s </p><p>Development (NEPAD).  The NEPAD agenda specifically lists as </p><p>key priorities "the deepening of financial markets ( </p><p>cross-border harmonization and integration ( risk reduction </p><p>and speeding up of financial market integration through </p><p>establishing an international standard legislative and </p><p>regulatory framework and creating a single African trading </p><p>platform.8 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Results of Meetings </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Briggs separately met chief executives/senior </p><p>representatives of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Central </p><p>Securities Clearing System,  Economic Community of West </p><p>African States (ECOWAS), Ministry of Integration and </p><p>Cooperation in Africa,  New Partnership for African </p><p>Development (NEPAD), Office of the President of the </p><p>Government of Nigeria, and the United States Agency for </p><p>International Development (USAID). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The reaction of Nigerian interlocutors to AfriClear was </p><p>universally positive.  Executives from the Nigerian Stock </p><p>Exchange discussed the utility and relevance of AfriClear to </p><p>plans to grow their market.  The exchange has already begun </p><p>cross-border listing initiatives with the Johannesburg Stock </p><p>Exchange, the kind of synergies that would be enhanced with a </p><p>facility such as AfriClear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The chief executive of the Central Securities Clearing </p><p>System (CSCS), the organization responsible for clearing </p><p>securities transactions generated on the floor of the </p><p>Nigerian Stock Exchange, welcomed the prospect of feeding </p><p>CSCS into a wider regional securities settlement network. He </p><p>also discussed present difficulties in attempts by smaller </p><p>regional players to piggy-back on Nigeria,s stock market </p><p>operations infrastructure. The CSCS Chief Exceutive believes </p><p>a facility like AfriClear would address these types of </p><p>constraints and facilitate cross-border transaction flows. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Minister for Integration and Cooperation in Africa, Dr. </p><p>Bimbo Ogunkelu, as well as the head of Nigeria,s NEPAD team, </p><p>Ambassador Isaac Aluko-Olokun, were receptive to the proposal </p><p>and agreed it would enhance economic development and directly </p><p>promote regional integration.  In separate meetings, they </p><p>both recommended the initiative as a NEPAD agenda item. </p><p>Ambassador Aluko-Olokun subsequently discussed the idea with </p><p>NEPAD counterparts in South Africa, and issued a formal </p><p>invitation letter asking for the proposal to be presented for </p><p>discussion at the Africa Union/NEPAD Regional Conference in </p><p>Cameroon in October 2002 </p><p>8. Briggs met Steven Oronsaye, Principal Secretary to the </p><p>President, and Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, Special Adviser to the </p><p>President on Budget Matters.  Oronsaye said he would bring </p><p>the proposal to the attention of President Obasanjo with a </p><p>recommendation that he support it for its potential impact on </p><p>portfolio investment into the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Ambassador Jeter and the USAID Mission Country Director </p><p>lend their support to including this project in our efforts </p><p>to assist economic development and integration in Africa. It </p><p>is hard to overestimate the role that private sector </p><p>investment might play in Africa.  AfriClear would make </p><p>private sector direct and portfolio investment attractive not </p><p>only to foreign investors, but also to the Nigerians and </p><p>other African investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The feasibility study for such a clearing mechanism would </p><p>require considerable technical expertise, much of which </p><p>resides in differing USG agencies. Post believes this is a </p><p>worthwhile project and would ask that relevant USG agencies, </p><p>including State, USAID, Treasury, USTR, and EXIM, take it </p><p>under consideration as a priority item for further </p><p>development. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
