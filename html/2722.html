<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001723 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE AND EUR/RPM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IT, PREL, RS, PREL, RS, NATO, MEPPIT, NATO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: READOUT OF BERLUSCONI-PUTIN SUMMIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 43835 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01723  01 OF 02  051649Z </p><p>1.  (C) ON APRIL 5, PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI\'S SENIOR </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA, TOLD POLMINCOUNS </p><p>TOM COUNTRYMAN THAT THE APRIL 2-3 BERLUSCONI-PUTIN SUMMIT WAS </p><p>THE MOST SUCCESSFUL RUSSIA-ITALY BILATERAL MEETING EVER HELD. </p><p> PUTIN MADE CLEAR TO BERLUSCONI HIS DESIRE TO ENHANCE AND </p><p>EXPAND UPON THE "SPECIAL PARTNERSHIP" ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO COUNTRIES.  NEXT TO GERMANY, ITALY IS RUSSIA\'S MAIN </p><p>TRADING PARTNER, AND PUTIN WANTS TO USE GERMANY AND ITALY AS </p><p>HIS MAIN CONNECTION TO AND SUPPORT IN THE EU.  AN INDICATION </p><p>OF THE SPECIAL PLACE ITALY HOLDS IN RUSSIA\'S FOREIGN </p><p>RELATIONS IS THE FACT THAT BERLUSCONI IS THE FIRST FOREIGN </p><p>LEADER TO BE INVITED TO PUTIN\'S DACHA IN SOCHI, WHERE THE </p><p>FIRST DAY\'S MEETINGS WERE CONDUCTED.  ON APRIL 3 THE SUMMIT </p><p>SHIFTED TO MOSCOW, AND BERLUSCONI WAS JOINED BY THE MINISTERS </p><p>OF FINANCE, INTERIOR, PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES, AND CULTURAL </p><p>HERITAGE.  THE SECOND DAY WAS CUT SHORT BY THE EMERGENCY EU </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING IN LUXEMBOURG. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CASTELLANETA TEMPERED BERLUSCONI\'S VERY POSITIVE </p><p>PUBLIC COMMENTS ON RUSSIA\'S EVENTUAL MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU AND </p><p>EVEN NATO BY EMPHASIZING THAT THE PM WAS REFERRING TO THE </p><p>VERY LONG TERM.  BERLUSCONI DOES SEE ROOM FOR QUICKER </p><p>MOVEMENT IN THE MEDIUM TERM, THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>COMMON EUROPEAN ECONOMIC SPACE.  THIS WILL BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS THE EU EXPANDS TO INCLUDE POLAND </p><p>AND THE BALTICS, ENVELOPING KALININGRAD IN THE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>NATO-RUSSIA </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01723  01 OF 02  051649Z </p><p>3.  (C)  ACCORDING TO CASTELLANETA, PUTIN CALLED PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH DURING BERLUSCONI\'S VISIT, AND DISCUSSED HIS DESIRE FOR </p><p>ACCELERATED NATO-RUSSIA NEGOTIATIONS, CULMINATING IN A TREATY </p><p>TO BE SIGNED IN ROME ON MAY 29.  THE CHOICE OF DATE WAS BASED </p><p>ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S TRAVEL TO RUSSIA 23-26 MAY, AND PUTIN\'S </p><p>REQUIREMENT TO BE IN MOSCOW ON MAY 28 FOR THE RUSSIA-EU </p><p>SUMMIT.  FOR THIS TIMING TO WORK, ADDED CASTELLANETA, THE </p><p>DOCUMENT NEEDS TO BE IN FINAL FORM FOR FMS TO APPROVE IN </p><p>REYKJAVIK ON MAY 15. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  CASTELLANETA SAID THAT PUTIN TOLD BERLUSCONI THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GO TO THE NOVEMBER NATO SUMMIT </p><p>IN PRAGUE "AS THINGS ARE TODAY."  CASTELLANETA SAID THAT A </p><p>NATO-RUSSIA AGREEMENT IN ROME WOULD HELP PUTIN TO JUSTIFY HIS </p><p>PRESENCE IN PRAGUE. (SEPTEL REPORTS RELATED CONVERSATION </p><p>BERLUSCONI HAD WITH AMBASSADOR SEMBLER WHEN THE FORMER </p><p>RETURNED FROM MOSCOW). </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>MEPP </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  BERLUSCONI AND PUTIN SHARE PRESIDENT BUSH\'S POSITION </p><p>ON THE NEED FOR A MEDIATED PEACE PROCESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p>PUTIN IS AWARE OF THE NEED TO TREAD CAREFULLY AND AVOID </p><p>PUSHING ISRAEL TO THE WALL, AND WANTS TO FIND THE RIGHT </p><p>BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES, AS DOES BERLUSCONI. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>IRAN/IRAQ </p><p>----------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01723  01 OF 02  051649Z </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  CASTELLANETA SAID THAT BERLUSCONI, AS REQUESTED BY </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH (REFTEL), CARRIED THE U.S. MESSAGE OF CONCERN </p><p>REGARDING WMD, STRESSING THE GOI WAS WORRIED THAT THE </p><p>TRANSFER OF SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGIES FROM RUSSIA TO IRAN WAS </p><p>AIDING IRAN\'S ATTEMPTS TO BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  BERLUSCONI </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THE GOI HAD INFORMATION (WITHOUT NAMING THE </p><p>SOURCE) THAT IRAN HAD AN ACTIVE PROGRAM TO DEVELOP BOTH </p><p>NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND BALLISTIC MISSILES.  PUTIN DISMISSED </p><p>THESE CONCERNS, ASSURING BERLUSCONI THAT RUSSIA SOLD ONLY </p><p>CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS TO IRAN, AND SAID THAT THERE WERE STRICT </p><p>CONTROLS ON ALL DUAL-USE AND NON-CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES. </p><p>PUTIN SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO SELL </p><p>SUCH CAPABILITIES TO IRAN, WHEN RUSSIA ITSELF COULD BE THE </p><p>FIRST TARGET. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  PUTIN EXPRESSED TO BERLUSCONI HIS CONCERN ABOUT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF A U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ, NOTING THAT </p><p>RUSSIA WANTS TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT ON IRAQ\'S HEAVY BILATERAL </p><p>DEBT.  PUTIN STRESSED THE NEED TO USE THE UN TO DEAL WITH </p><p>IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3519 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01723  02 OF 02  051649Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DS-00    OIGO-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00   M-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  PM-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------7FBC4A  051649Z /38 </p><p>O 051600Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO AMEMBASSY MOSCOW IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 3127 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001723 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE AND EUR/RPM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IT, NATO, PREL, RS, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: READOUT OF BERLUSCONI-PUTIN SUMMIT </p><p> </p><p>BALKANS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  PUTIN TOLD BERLUSCONI THAT THE CAPABILITY OF RUSSIA </p><p>TO COOPERATE WITH THE ESDP PROCESS WOULD REMAIN LIMITED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01723  02 OF 02  051649Z </p><p>BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS TAKING KOSOVO IN A </p><p>DIRECTION THAT RUSSIA CAN\'T ACCEPT.  ACCORDING TO PUTIN, THIS </p><p>IS THE MAIN REASON THAT RUSSIA WILL GRADUALLY REDUCE THE </p><p>NUMBER OF ITS TROOPS COMMITTED TO KOSOVO. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>AFGHANISTAN </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  PUTIN REITERATED TO BERLUSCONI HIS SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>OEF ALLIANCE\'S GOALS IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT WOULD NOT COMMIT </p><p>RUSSIAN TROOPS TO THE EFFORT.  HE EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT, GIVEN THE SOPHISTICATION OF U.S. WEAPONS </p><p>ALREADY USED IN AFGHANISTAN, THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE THE USE </p><p>OF TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>WARHEAD REDUCTION </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  PUTIN TOLD BERLUSCONI THAT NUCLEAR WARHEAD </p><p>REDUCTION TALKS WITH THE U.S. WERE CLOSE TO SUCCESSFUL </p><p>CONCLUSION.  ONE AREA OF CONCERN FOR THE RUSSIANS IS THE U.S. </p><p>PREFERENCE TO STOCKPILE, RATHER THAN DESTROY, THE EXCESS </p><p>WARHEADS.  PUTIN CITED THE HIGH COST OF STORING WARHEADS, BUT </p><p>SAID THAT IF THE U.S. INSISTS, THE RUSSIANS WILL GO ALONG. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>DEBT </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01723  02 OF 02  051649Z </p><p>11.  (C) PUTIN TOLD BERLUSCONI THAT HE WELCOMED THE IDEA OF </p><p>"TEN PLUS TEN OVER TEN".  PUTIN WOULD PREFER, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THE DENOMINATOR OF THE EQUATION BE REDUCED TO FIVE YEARS. </p><p>CASTELLANETA TOLD COUNTRYMAN THAT ITALY SUPPORTS THE IDEA IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE, BUT WOULD PREFER A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, RATHER </p><p>THAN USING NEW MONEY AS PROPOSED BY GERMANY.  THE G-8 HAS </p><p>TAKEN UP THIS ISSUE. PUTIN ASKED BERLUSCONI TO CONSIDER </p><p>DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR ADDRESSING RUSSIA\'S DEBT TO ITALY. </p><p>NOTE: RUSSIAN DEBT TO ITALY, APPROXIMATELY 9.2 BILLION, IS </p><p>SECOND ONLY TO ITS DEBT TO GERMANY.  OF THAT AMOUNT, NEARLY </p><p>USD 7.6 BILLION IS SOVIET-ERA DEBT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01723 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
