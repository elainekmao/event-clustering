Summary: Evidence suggests the GoZ understates the </p><p>country\'s inflation, as the Central Statistical Office (CSO) </p><p>relies on an outdated Consumer Price Index (CPI) and </p><p>disregards product availability.  However, data are </p><p>unavailable to determine how far inflation runs beyond the </p><p>official rate, currently 140 percent. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. We recently hashed over inflation data with officials at </p><p>CSO, the rough equivalent of the U.S. Bureau of Labor </p><p>Statistics and sole GoZ organ that gathers monthly CPI data. </p><p>We are not aware of an independent body, other than our </p><p>USAID mission (more below), that tracks price changes. </p><p> </p><p>Methodology Flaws </p><p>----------------- </p><p>3. CSO\'s indexing process has two glaring shortcomings. </p><p>First, it has not adjusted CPI weights in the basket of </p><p>goods and services since 1995, when Zimbabwe enjoyed a more </p><p>robust economy.  The present CPI assumes that food accounts </p><p>for just 33.6 percent of household purchases, although </p><p>Zimbabwean families now spend the bulk of their income on </p><p>diet.  Furthermore, at a time when half the country\'s </p><p>population is threatened by famine, the CPI seems to </p><p>overemphasize clothing and footwear (6.9 percent), furniture </p><p>(7.5 percent) and entertainment (1.2 percent). </p><p> </p><p>4. Second, CSO data do not reflect black-market food cost. </p><p>Surveyors visit shops that list only official prices.  They </p><p>do not check for product availability, a common problem in </p><p>today\'s Zimbabwe, so there is no mechanism for determining </p><p>repressed inflation or product substitution. </p><p> </p><p>5. Given that a) food should now dominate the CPI and b) its </p><p>yearly increase is certainly higher than the reported 125.5 </p><p>percent, we unscientifically conclude that overall inflation </p><p>exceeds 140 percent.  As peripheral evidence, we note that </p><p>annual monetary expansion is running at 102 percent and the </p><p>Zimdollar has lost 70 percent in parallel markets since </p><p>October 2001. </p><p> </p><p>So How High is Inflation? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>6. The USAID Mission economist has developed an intriguing </p><p>"back of the envelope" model that elevates CPI weights for </p><p>food, housing and transport/communications (though without a </p><p>household survey).  USAID staffers collect data, taking into </p><p>account official as well as black-market prices for goods </p><p>and services.  Findings through September 2002 indicate an </p><p>annual inflation rate of 316 percent using controlled prices </p><p>and 422 percent using parallel market prices.  We consider </p><p>the USAID model a useful counterpoint to the official CPI, </p><p>but feel the products and services included (e.g., "Ortho </p><p>King" bed, lounge suite, international phone call, etc.) may </p><p>be import-heavy and skewed toward middle-class buying </p><p>patterns. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. When pressed, CSO statisticians acknowledged the </p><p>shortcomings of their CPI process, but argued they may also </p><p>be exaggerating inflation in some areas by overweighing CPI </p><p>groups dominated by imports (such as electronics).  This is </p><p>no doubt true.  However, if you elevate food\'s share of the </p><p>CPI from 33.6 to, say, 60-80 percent and use international </p><p>norms to determine price fluctuation, your net effect will </p><p>still be far steeper than reported inflation.  Thus while </p><p>the oft-cited official inflation rate is conservative, we </p><p>are unable to calculate how much higher it should be. </p><p>Zimbabweans, of course, do not need an accurate CPI to tell </p><p>them their standard of living is disintegrating.  (Per </p><p>capita GDP will have fallen from US$ 736 in 1997 to US$ 273 </p><p>by the end of the year.) </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
