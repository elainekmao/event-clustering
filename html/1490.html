<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 000419 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/24/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: KABILA LAID TO REST </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>IN A DIGNIFIED, WELL ORGANIZED SIX-HOUR CEREMONY, PRESIDENT </p><p>LAURENT KABILA WAS BURIED JANUARY 23 IN THE PRESENCE OF SIX </p><p>AFRICAN PRESIDENTS, AND NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>FOREIGN DELEGATIONS ALMOST ALL OF WHOM DEPARTED KINSHASA </p><p>BEFORE NIGHTFALL.  SECURITY WAS TIGHT AROUND THE NEW </p><p>PRESIDENT, JOSEPH KABILA, WITH ANGOLAN AND ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>REINFORCEMENTS FORMING ITS BACKBONE, AND, WHILE THERE WERE </p><p>TENSE MOMENTS AMONG THE HUGE CROWD LINING THE STREETS, THERE </p><p>WERE NO MAJOR INCIDENTS.  OFFICIAL EULOGIES, OVERALL, WERE </p><p>CONCILIATORY.  AFTER THE FUNERAL, THE GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY </p><p>BEGAN PREPARATIONS FOR THE INAUGURATION OF JOSEPH KABILA.. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>2. (C) STRONG FOREIGN PARTICIPATION </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>SIX AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE ATTENDED THE FUNERAL SERVICE AT </p><p>THE PALAIS DU PEUPLE AND BURIAL AT A NEW MAUSOLEUM IN FRONT </p><p>OF THE PALAIS DE LA NATION.  BESIDES THE DRC\'S THREE SADC </p><p>ALLIES -- DOS SANTOS OF ANGOLA, MUGABE OF ZIMBABWE, AND </p><p>NUJOMA OF NAMIBIA -- ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT CHILUBA, AND THE </p><p>SUDANESE AND MALAWIAN HEADS OF STATE ALSO ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER DELEGATIONS INCLUDED:  FORMER NIGERIAN HEAD OF STATE </p><p>ABUBAKAR; THE VICE PRESIDENTS OF SOUTH AFRICA AND KENYA; </p><p>BELGIAN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER LOUIS MICHEL; AS WELL AS </p><p>MINISTERIAL DELEGATIONS FROM GUINEA/CONAKRY; EQUATORIAL </p><p>GUINEA; MOROCCO; TANZANIA; LIBYA; IRAN; CUBA; BENIN; CHAD; </p><p>AND CONGO/BRAZZAVILLE; AND THE OAU DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>3. (S) SECURITY TIGHT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUNERAL AND BURIAL WERE TIGHT. </p><p>ANGOLA FLEW IN SEVERAL HUNDRED REINFORCEMENTS, INCLUDING A </p><p>NUMBER OF THEIR OWN POLICE VEHICLES, AND ZIMBABWE MADE </p><p>IMPRESSIVE FIGHTER PLANE FLYOVERS DURING POIGNANT MOMENTS, </p><p>INCLUDING AT THE TIME KABILA\'S BODY WAS PLACED IN A MARBLE </p><p>MAUSOLEUM, HASTILY CONSTRUCTED IN THE DAYS SINCE HIS </p><p>ASSASSINATION. </p><p> </p><p>AT A RUMP SESSION OF WESTERN AMBASSADORS FOLLOWING THE </p><p>FUNERAL AND BURIAL, THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR ASSERTED THAT, WITH </p><p>VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS, BOTH THE CONGO\'S RAPID INTERVENTION </p><p>POLICE AND THE FAC MILITARY HAD BEEN DISARMED, PUTTING </p><p>SECURITY AT PRESENT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OF THE </p><p>ANGOLANS AND ZIMBABWEANS. </p><p> </p><p>EMOTIONS WERE RUNNING HIGH THROUGHOUT THE DAY, CAUSING US AS </p><p>WELL AS THE FRENCH AND SEVERAL OTHER EMBASSIES TO PUT OUT AN </p><p>"ALL CALL" RADIO MESSAGE TO WARDENS AND OTHER CITIZENS TO </p><p>STAY OFF THE STREET FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.  SOME IN THE </p><p>CROWDS THICKLY LINING THE STREETS YELLED INSULTS AT DIPLOMATS </p><p>AS THEIR CARS PASSED, AND THERE WERE ISOLATED INSTANCES OF </p><p>STONES BEING THROWN AT DIPLOMATIC VEHICLES, INCLUDING THAT OF </p><p>BELGIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ON HIS WAY TO THE AIRPORT. </p><p> </p><p>THERE WERE NO SERIOUS INCIDENTS, HOWEVER, AND NO ONE OF WHOM </p><p>WE ARE AWARE WAS INJURED.  IN GENERAL, SECURITY AUTHORITIES </p><p>DID A COMMENDABLE JOB OF MAINTAINING ORDER, ESPECIALLY GIVEN </p><p>THE RECORD NUMBER OF PERSONS ON THE STREET.  (IN CONTRAST TO </p><p>THE FUNERAL AT THE "PALAIS DU PEUPLE", CROWDS WERE EXCLUDED </p><p>FROM APPROACHING THE BURIAL SITE AT THE DOWNTOWN "PALAIS DE </p><p>LA NATION".) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>4. (S) EULOGIES TO A SLAIN LEADER </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>OVERALL, THE PUBLIC EULOGIES TO KABILA WERE CONCILIATORY AND </p><p>FORWARD-LOOKING.  THE MAJOR EXCEPTION WAS THAT OF THE </p><p>"TRANSITIONAL PARLIAMENT" (ACL-PT) REPRESENTATIVE WHICH </p><p>LARGELY REHASHED THE STANDARD FARE CONCERNING RWANDAN/UGANDAN </p><p>AGGRESSION.  MINISTER OF STATE KAKUDJI, WHILE BLAMING ALL OF </p><p>THE CONGO\'S CURRENT PROBLEMS ON THE WAR, DID ENDORSE A </p><p>DIALOGUE AMONG THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE "ONCE ORDER HAS BEEN </p><p>RESTORED."  THE WAR, HE SAID, HAD "UNFORTUNATELY" RUINED THE </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR KABILA\'S PROGRAM OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORMS.  HE RECEIVED LOUD APPLAUSE WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT WOULD SPARE NO EFFORT IN CONDUCTING A THOROUGH </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION, BUT NO APPLAUSE ON EITHER </p><p>OF THE TWO OCCASIONS WHEN BE REFERRED TO JOSEPH KABILA AS THE </p><p>NEW PRESIDENT.  KAKUDJI CALLED ON MONUC TO DEPLOY AND FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THE UNSC RESOLUTIONS </p><p>ARE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. </p><p> </p><p>THE CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP, CARDINAL ETSOU, MADE THE MOST </p><p>THOUGHTFUL AND COURAGEOUS ELOCUTION OF THE DAY, CONDEMNING </p><p>ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE IN PURSUIT OF, OR TO CONSERVE, POWER. </p><p>HE URGED A SINCERE, FRANK DIALOGUE AMONG THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE </p><p>"WITHOUT EXCLUSION," IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A STATE OF LAW AND </p><p>PROSPEROUS NATION, AND APPEALED TO ALL THE BELLIGERENTS TO </p><p>END THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>5. (S) COMMENT: </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>WE, AND OUR DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES, CONTINUE TO BE IMPRESSED </p><p>WITH THE SMOOTH, EFFICIENT MANNER IN WHICH THE INTERIM </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS CONDUCTING THE AFFAIRS OF STATE, AT LEAST ON </p><p>TECHNICAL MATTERS SUCH AS FUNERAL AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. </p><p>THEY ARE NOW BUSILY PREPARING THE INAUGURATION OF JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA AS HIS FATHER\'S SUCCESSOR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
