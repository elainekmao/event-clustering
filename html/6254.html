<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000567 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, MARR, SNAR, KCRM, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  REVIEWING BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH DPM DUNG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary.  DPM Dung expressed general satisfaction </p><p>with US-Vietnam relations, especially regarding trade and </p><p>investment ties, along with the desire to do more to push </p><p>the relationship further.  He complained about the recent </p><p>flag cases, catfish, and the US desire for a textile </p><p>agreement, which he claimed the US negotiator had promised </p><p>the US would not pursue if Vietnam bought Boeing aircraft. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Senior Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung </p><p>requested a meeting with Ambassador March 10 to exchange </p><p>views on how further to strengthen the bilateral </p><p>relationship.  Septels will cover Iraq, the new Chancery </p><p>site, and intelligence sharing. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Ambassador noted his efforts over the past 15 </p><p>months to implement the US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade </p><p>Agreement, including through a variety of USG-funded </p><p>programs, in order to help Vietnam better integrate into the </p><p>international community and prepare itself for eventual </p><p>accession to the World Trade Organization.  He also noted </p><p>that he has encouraged non-governmental organizations, </p><p>businesses, universities, and other private entities </p><p>establish their own links with Vietnam to promote better </p><p>ties and understanding.  He pointed to the success of the </p><p>recent Asia Society corporate conference, the upcoming </p><p>opening of the Vietnam exhibition at the American Museum of </p><p>Natural History in New York, and the appointment of an </p><p>executive director for the Vietnam Educational Foundation as </p><p>concrete examples of progress in the latter field. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Ambassador cited three areas where much more needs </p><p>to be accomplished to move our relationship to a more truly </p><p>normal basis:  mil-to-mil ties, law enforcement cooperation, </p><p>and intelligence sharing, all of which are among the most </p><p>sensitive aspects in our still new relationship.  He noted </p><p>that the time had come to move our relationship beyond just </p><p>economic interests and the need by Vietnam for access to the </p><p>US market in order to look for ways to develop a more </p><p>comprehensive and strategic relationship. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  On the military side, the prospect of a visit this </p><p>year to the U.S. by Defense Minister Tra, ongoing </p><p>discussions about US Navy ship visits, and greater access </p><p>granted to our Defense Attache are welcome developments.  On </p><p>a more negative note, we were disappointed with the last </p><p>minute cancellation of a scheduled meeting with the </p><p>Vietnamese Defense Ministry\'s Deputy Chief of General Staff </p><p>for intelligence with the visiting Defense Intelligence </p><p>Agency\'s chief of staff.  On the law enforcement side, </p><p>despite the successful May 2002 conference bringing together </p><p>a variety of related agencies from both governments, little </p><p>progress has been made.  DEA\'s contacts and information </p><p>sharing with the Ministry of Public Security remain very one- </p><p>sided, demonstrating a continued reluctance by MPS to share </p><p>information even about narcotics. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  DPM Dung noted that Vietnam had been "encouraged" </p><p>with the results of the BTA implementation so far, and </p><p>underscored the priority Vietnam attaches to trade and </p><p>investment both in the present and in the long-term.  He </p><p>complimented Ambassador for his personal role in BTA </p><p>implementation.  He stressed that greater cooperation on the </p><p>BTA was not just important for economic reasons, but also as </p><p>a way of bringing our two countries and peoples together, </p><p>improving mutual understanding, and building a long-standing </p><p>friendship. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  DPM Dung noted ongoing problems to solve, notably </p><p>catfish and textiles;  resolution would require that both </p><p>sides really listen to each other\'s viewpoints.  He noted </p><p>that many Vietnamese felt that recent US decisions on these </p><p>issues in particular had been "discriminatory" as well as </p><p>bad for bilateral relations, and had especially been </p><p>"lacking in goodwill."  He urged Ambassador to take personal </p><p>responsibility for dealing with these issues.  On textiles, </p><p>he claimed that then-Deputy USTR Fisher had "promised" </p><p>during BTA negotiations that, if Vietnam agreed to buy </p><p>Boeing aircraft, the US would not pursue a textile </p><p>agreement.  Ambassador indicated surprise at such a claim, </p><p>but DPM Dung said that Fisher had personally made this </p><p>commitment to him in the same room in which we were now </p><p>sitting.   Ambassador noted that, in any event, textile </p><p>agreements were fairly routine, and would have only a short </p><p>lifespan given the WTO decision to abolish them in 2005 </p><p>among members.  Once Vietnam acceded, it would have full </p><p>access to this US market.   He noted that current </p><p>uncertainty among US garment buyers could only hurt </p><p>Vietnam\'s longer-term interests.  He stressed that purchases </p><p>of Boeing aircraft made good sense in their own right.  He </p><p>cited discriminatory actions on the side of the GVN -- film </p><p>censorship, restrictions on certain areas of investment. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  DPM Dung complained also about recent legislation </p><p>in Virginia and California mandating use of the Republic of </p><p>Vietnam flag.  While saying that he understood that the </p><p>State Department\'s ability to stop such legislation was </p><p>constitutionally limited, he stressed that such decisions </p><p>have a "harmful" impact on international affairs and </p><p>bilateral relations, and the State Department would be more </p><p>active in opposing them.  Ambassador noted that the bottom </p><p>line problem was that the GVN had not been more aggressive </p><p>in reaching out to the Viet Kieu community in the United </p><p>States.  He urged the GVN to take more steps toward </p><p>reconciliation, such as sending out SRV Embassy and Congen </p><p>staff to meet with them, or even inviting former South </p><p>Vietnamese Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky to visit.  DPM Dung </p><p>reacted emotionally, noting that the officials of the former </p><p>regime in Saigon had been responsible for bringing in 1 </p><p>million US troops and resulting in the death of 3 million </p><p>Vietnamese; they are "criminals" and would never be welcomed </p><p>back.  He agreed with Ambassador\'s comment that, in that </p><p>case, reconciliation would require "generations." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  DPM Dung pledged that Vietnam would continue to try </p><p>to improve cooperation and broaden the relationship, </p><p>including in areas such as education and training, cultural </p><p>exchanges, and dealing with the legacy of the war (Agent </p><p>Orange, landmines, MIAs on both sides).  He noted that </p><p>Defense Minister Tra indeed planned to visit the US, along </p><p>with other probable visits by the National Assembly Chairman </p><p>and DPM Vu Khoan.  He pointed to more joint efforts on </p><p>military training.  He cited information sharing related to </p><p>counter-terrorism.  He described Vietnam\'s commitment to </p><p>combating narcotics, and said that only a few minor </p><p>obstacles remained related to taxes paid by US staff. </p><p>(Note:  an apparent reference to long-standing negotiations </p><p>over a Counter-narcotics agreement with State\'s INL.  End </p><p>note) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Ambassador noted that he had yet to meet with </p><p>General Secretary Nong Duc Manh, the first time in his 32 </p><p>years as a diplomat that he had not met the most senior </p><p>political figure in a country.  DPM Dung said that GS Manh </p><p>had agreed to the meeting in principle, that he would </p><p>personally again forward the request, and that it was only a </p><p>matter of scheduling at this point. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Comment:  While sometimes a feisty interlocutor, </p><p>DPM Dung appeared extremely well-briefed on bilateral ties, </p><p>as well as sincerely dedicated to further improvement of </p><p>relations.  Ambassador will attempt to seek more regular </p><p>exchanges such as this one to get over some of our mutual </p><p>misunderstandings and to clarify Vietnamese attitudes in the </p><p>interests of promoting stronger and deeper ties. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
