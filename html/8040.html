<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001243 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, PREL, PINR, KDEM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT OF SUPREME ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL DISCUSSES </p><p>UPCOMING ELECTIONS WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AIDOFF Todd Amani for reason 1.5 (b)(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  During a courtesy call by the Ambassador, </p><p>the President of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) </p><p>indicated his belief that General Rios Montt is prohibited by </p><p>law from being a candidate for president, but noted that if </p><p>the TSE is asked to decide this question, other magistrates </p><p>may have different views.  He stated that the TSE would be </p><p>seeking a decision from the Constitutional Court to force the </p><p>Congress to name a new magistrate to fill the position left </p><p>open when one of the original magistrates selected by the </p><p>Congress refused to take the position.  He also indicated </p><p>that the Carter Center had sought him out to discuss an </p><p>election observation mission. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>TSE Position on Rios Montt Candidacy </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador paid a courtesy call on President of </p><p>Guatemala\'s Supreme Electoral Tribunal Oscar Bolanos on May </p><p>7, 2003 to express support for their efforts and review </p><p>current issues facing the Tribunal.  In response to a </p><p>question about what the TSE will do if General Rios Montt </p><p>attempts to register as a candidate, Bolanos indicated that </p><p>he believes it is clear under the law that he cannot be a </p><p>candidate.  When asked how other magistrates feel about the </p><p>issue, Bolanos indicated that he had spoken to two of them </p><p>and believes there may be some willingness by others on the </p><p>TSE to approve Rios Montt as a candidate.  (COMMENT:  Bolanos </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>position on this issue could be important if the TSE must </p><p>rule on Rios Montt\'s candidacy.  Observers believe two of the </p><p>current magistrates may have links to the FRG, while the </p><p>remaining two seem to operate more independently.  Thus, </p><p>Bolanos\' position on the five-person tribunal could be the </p><p>determining vote.  Even if the TSE were to disapprove a Rios </p><p>Montt candidacy, it would likely be appealed to the </p><p>Constitutional Court which could well approve his candidacy. </p><p>END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>Addressing Disputed TSE Position </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ambassador raised the issue of the TSE position </p><p>that was not filled after the new TSE was initially named, </p><p>noting that an OAS legal review suggested that Congressional </p><p>failure to select a new magistrate could leave the TSE open </p><p>to legal challenges at any point during the election process. </p><p>  Bolanos indicated that the TSE has pressed this issue with </p><p>Congressional leaders repeatedly since they took office but </p><p>have been told that Congress is unable to get the two-thirds </p><p>vote needed to name a new magistrate.   Referring to the law, </p><p>he noted that he believes the current situation whereby a </p><p>suplente has filled the position is defensible legally (as </p><p>the FRG leadership has stated to Embassy officers), but the </p><p>TSE believes the questions raised about this situation could </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>damage the credibility of the institution during the election </p><p>period.  He noted confidentially that the TSE would be </p><p>seeking a ruling from the constitutional court the following </p><p>day to force the hand of the Congress on this issue. </p><p>(COMMENT:  Legal opinions on this matter seem to differ, but </p><p>Bolanos is probably right that this issue needs to be </p><p>addressed for political reasons.  Court action may put </p><p>increased pressure on the Congress to get the few remaining </p><p>votes needed to name a new magistrate and resolve this </p><p>situation. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>Carter Center Interest In Observation Mission </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In response to a question about various planned </p><p>observation missions to be carried out by the OAS, EU, and </p><p>local civil society groups, Bolanos noted that he had been </p><p>sought out by the Carter Center while observing the Argentina </p><p>election process regarding a possible observation mission to </p><p>Guatemala.  He noted that the TSE is generally supportive of </p><p>these efforts.  (COMMENT:  Embassy was not aware of Carter </p><p>Center plans for an observation mission, but welcomes their </p><p>involvement if they have funding from other sources.  At this </p><p>point we do not have resources available to fund a Carter </p><p>Center observation effort.) </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
