IRVING FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 16 THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSION HERE SHARED WITH </p><p>US THE TEXT OF THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE SENT TO LONDON FEBRUARY 15 </p><p>REPORTING ON MORGAN TSVANGIRAI\'S OBSERVATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ZANU-PF </p><p>OVERTURES TO HIS PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZANU-PF OVERTURES TO TSVANGIRAI </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>1. TSVANGIRAI OPENING DIALOGUE WITH GOVERNMENT; BUT NOT TALKING </p><p>ABOUT GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY.  EARLY DAYS; NOT YET </p><p>DISCUSSED WITH MDC EXECUTIVE.  SAYS HE IS AWARE OF THE DANGERS </p><p>BUT HAS TO RESPOND TO OVERTURES FROM GOZ IN THE INTERESTS OF </p><p>THE NATION. </p><p> </p><p>DETAIL </p><p> </p><p>2. ON 15 FEBRUARY SECOND SECRETARY LINDSAY CALLED ON MDC PRESIDENT TSVA </p><p>NGIRAI </p><p>TO DISCUSS INFORMATION WE HAD RECEIVED ABOUT OVERTURES </p><p>MADE BY ZANU-PF TO THE MDC.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THAT THE COUNTRY WAS </p><p>IN A DEEP CRISIS; ZANU-PF COULD NOT SURVIVE WITHOUT REPRESSION AND </p><p>THE MDC COULD NOT WIN BY CONFRONTING THAT REPRESSION.  IT WAS IN THE NA </p><p>TIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00760  01 OF 02  160929Z </p><p>INTEREST THAT THEY EMBARK UPON DIALOGUE; BUT THE ONUS WAS </p><p>ON ZANU-PF.  HE ADDED THAT ZANU-PF WAS ON ITS KNEES ECONOMICALLY, </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT WAS STILL STRONG POLITICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>3. TSVANGIRAI REITERATED HIS CONVICTION THAT HE WOULD WIN A </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2002, BUT NOTED THAT WINNING THE ELECTION </p><p>WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WINNING POWER.  WE SHOULD NOT DISMISS </p><p>MUGABE\'S RHETORIC WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW TSVANGIRAI </p><p>TO BECOME PRESIDENT.  THE MDC ALREADY HAD GOOD CONTACTS WITHIN THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES BUT MUGABE HAS CREATED ALTERNATIVE MILITIAS WHICH </p><p>COULD VERY QUICKLY CREATE CHAOS.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THAT MASS ACTION </p><p>WOULD ONLY BE LEGITIMATE IF HE WON THE ELECTION AND WAS NOT ALLOWED </p><p>TO ASSUME POWER.  EVEN IF HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE POWER TSVANGIRAI </p><p>WONDERED WHAT WOULD BE LEFT OF THE COUNTRY IN FIFTEEN MONTHS TIME. </p><p>HE AGREED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP </p><p>A GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO SENSIBLE PROGRAMMES OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY </p><p>AND REFORM BUT IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN ON THE FIRST DAY AND HE WOULD </p><p>NEED BREATHING SPACE. </p><p> </p><p>4. FOR THESE REASONS TSVANGIRAI SAID IT WAS SENSIBLE TO HAVE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  BUT THESE WERE AT AN EMBRYONIC </p><p>STAGE; THERE HAD BEEN A SERIES OF OVERTURES FROM ZANU-PF BUT NOTHING </p><p>CONCRETE.  TSVANGIRAI MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE MDC WERE NOT INITIATING AN </p><p>YTHING, AND THEY WERE NOT NEGOTIATING.  THEY HAD ALREADY SPECIFIED </p><p>THAT IF THEY WERE TO ENTER DISCUSSIONS IT WOULD BE AS AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>PARTY - EVERYONE KNEW HOW ZAPU HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP BY ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>5. LINDSAY ASKED HOW WIDELY THIS HAD BEEN DISCUSSED WITHIN THE MDC. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SAID THAT THE ONLY WAY TO PROCEED WAS THROUGH OPEN DEBATE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IN THE EXECUTIVE, BUT THIS HAD NOT YET BEGUN.  NOBODY WOULD BE FORCED </p><p>DOWN THIS ROUTE AND HE EXPECTED SOME VERY STRONG OPPOSITION FROM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00760  01 OF 02  160929Z </p><p>WITHIN HIS PARTY - BUT HE WELCOMED SOME HEALTHY DEBATE.  LINDSAY </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THEY BELIEVED THE OVERTURES TO BE GENUINE; ALL THE </p><p>RHETORIC AND ACTIONS FROM ZANU-PF OVER THE LAST SIX WEEKS INDICATED </p><p>A HARDENING OF THEIR POSITION AND INCREASING POLARISATION OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.  TSVANGIRAI CONCURRED, BUT SAID THAT THE MDC </p><p>HAD A NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO EXPLORE ANY OPPORTUNITIES; THERE </p><p>HAD TO BE NATIONAL CONSENSUS OVER THE ISSUES OF RULE OF LAW, LAND </p><p>AND THE ECONOMY.  THEY WOULD TEST THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE APPROACH </p><p>BY DEMANDING AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO THE RULE OF LAW.  HE WAS </p><p>EMPHATIC THAT HE WAS NOT THROWING A LIFELINE TO ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>6. ON 14 FEBRUARY CLIVE PUZEY, A PROMINENT WHITE BUSINESSMAN WHO </p><p>SUPPORTS THE MDC HAD BRIEFED US ABOUT THESE DEVELOPMENTS, </p><p>APPARENTLY WITH TSVANGIRAI\'S BLESSING.  HE WENT INTO MORE DETAIL </p><p>WITH A STORY ABOUT FINDING AN OFFSHORE LOCATION FOR SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSS </p><p>IONS, </p><p>USING THE VATICAN AS AN INTERMEDIARY, AND A </p><p>FAR-FETCHED SCHEME BY THE MDC TO FLATTER MUGABE ON HIS BIRTHDAY </p><p>(21 FEBRUARY).  HE SAID THAT THE ULTIMATE AIM OF PARTICIPATING </p><p>IN THIS DIALOGUE WOULD BE TO EXPOSE THE DIVISIONS WITHIN ZANU-PF </p><p>AND TO ENSURE MUGABE\'S DEMISE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2710 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00760  02 OF 02  160929Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------C68A58  160929Z /38 </p><p>R 160929Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8237 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000760 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X5 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BRITISH REPORT ON ZANU-PF OVERTURES TO THE MDC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00760  02 OF 02  160929Z </p><p> </p><p>7. TSVANGIRAI APPEARED CONFIDENT AND RELAXED DISCUSSING THIS </p><p>SUBJECT.  HIS PERSONAL ADVISER GANDI MUDZINGWA WAS ALSO PRESENT </p><p>AND LATER TOLD LINDSAY THAT THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY </p><p>FROM THE WHITE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, WHO THOUGHT THEY COULD BROKER </p><p>A DEAL BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES.  THE MDC HAD TO SEE WHAT THEY </p><p>COULD OFFER, AND EXPLORE ALL AVENUES. </p><p> </p><p>8. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT.  IF THE OVERTURES FROM </p><p>ZANU-PF ARE GENUINE IT REVEALS A REAL CONCERN ABOUT THEIR </p><p>RE-ELECTION CHANCES.  BUT WE THINK IT MORE LIKELY THAT THEY ARE </p><p>TRYING TO MANUFACTURE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE MDC.  WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI UNDERESTIMATES THE DANGER THIS COULD POSE TO THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>UNITY OF HIS PARTY, AND WE EMPHASISED TO HIM THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>WIDE INTERNAL CONSULTATION BEFORE EMBARKING UPON ANY SUBSTANTIVE DISCUS </p><p>SIONS. </p><p>HE DID CONCEDE THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE MDC\'S </p><p>ELECTORAL INTEREST TO WORK TO IMPROVE THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY, </p><p>BUT REPEATED THAT IT WAS A NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>IS EITHER VERY NAIVE; DEEPLY IN THRALL TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY </p><p>WHO ONLY SEE CHAOS AND BANKRUPTCY IF THE PRESENT IMPASSES </p><p>CONTINUES; OR PLAYING A MORE SUBTLE GAME TRYING TO FIND DIVISIONS </p><p>WITHIN ZANU-PF.  WE THINK HE IS TRYING TO PURSUE BOTH OF THE </p><p>LATTER TWO OPTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ORIGINATOR: RICHARD LINDSAY, SECOND SECRETARY POLITICAL </p><p> </p><p>LONGWORTH </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00760  02 OF 02  160929Z </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: WE AGREE WITH THE BRITISH ASSESSMENT ABOUT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S POLITICAL NAIVETE AND ZANU-PF\'S PROBABLE INTENTION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OF SPLITTING THE MDC.  ON THE OTHER HAND, SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT </p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, WHO INITIATED THE CONTACTS WITH THE MDC, </p><p>IS A SHREWD POLITICAL PLAYER.  HE MAY BE EXPLORING ALTERNATIVES </p><p>TO THE CURRENT COURSE ON WHICH THE RULING PARTY IS TAKING THE </p><p>COUNTRY, WEIGHING THE OPTIONS FOR THE GOOD OF ZANU-PF AND, NOT </p><p>THE LEAST, HIMSELF AS PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S HEIR APPARENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
