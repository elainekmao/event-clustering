FOR </p><p>THAT REASON, THE VATICAN CONTINUES TO FAVOR THE CONVENING OF </p><p>A PEACE CONFERENCE AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY.  THE HOLY SEE </p><p>ALSO BELIEVES THAT SOME FORM OF INTERNATIONAL FORCE IS NEEDED </p><p>TO SEPARATE THE TWO SIDES AND PROVIDE A BREATHING SPACE TO </p><p>DAMPEN CURRENT HIGH EMOTIONS.  TAURAN REITERATED THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S MOUNTING CONCERN FOR THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT\'S RECENT </p><p>ACTIONS TO DENY VISAS TO ARCHBISHOP MAZUR AND TO RESTRICT </p><p>VISAS FOR OTHER CATHOLIC PRIESTS.

SHARON HAD OBSERVED THAT CHRISTIANS AND JEWS LIVING IN </p><p>A HOSTILE ARAB SEA COULD ONLY SURVIVE BY BEING IN A </p><p>CONTINUOUS STATE OF WAR.  TAURAN WRYLY REMARKED THAT THIS HAD </p><p>BEEN TRIED CENTURIES BEFORE DURING THE CRUSADES, BUT THE </p><p>RESULTS DID NOT LEND MUCH SUPPORT SHARON\'S THESIS.  THE HOLY </p><p>SEE SEES LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT SHARON HAS CHANGED HIS VIEWS, </p><p>AND REMAINS SKEPTICAL THAT SHARON IS COMMITTED TO A POLITICAL </p><p>SOLUTION.
