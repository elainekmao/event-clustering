O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe\'s Looming Default Crisis </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Once this - or a future - GOZ </p><p>eliminates negative real interest rates, local bankers </p><p>expect borrowers to default en masse.  The coming default </p><p>crisis underlines how difficult it will be to rationalize </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s distortion-laden economy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Only Decent Investment is Red Ink </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) In real terms, interest rates are a whopping 200 </p><p>percent negative (subtracting 250 percent inflation from </p><p>a 50 percent nominal interest rate).  One of the few good </p><p>investments in this collapsing economy has been </p><p>borrowing, then converting to hard currency.  (The </p><p>Zimdollar has fallen from Z$ 346 to 2100:US$ 1 in exactly </p><p>one year.)  Someday a GOZ will recognize the downsides of </p><p>negative rates and allow them to rise above inflation. </p><p>At that point, the President of the Zimbabwe Bankers </p><p>Association believes few businesses or homeowners will be </p><p>able to service debts (almost all carry variable rates). </p><p>He expects massive foreclosures. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) How could the GOZ allow interest rates to get so </p><p>out of sync with inflation?  To some extent, it has </p><p>relied on misguided economic counsel.  Samuel Undenge, a </p><p>rare economist in GOZ good graces, is frequently touted </p><p>as an economic expert in the official press.  He is such </p><p>an evangelical believer in low borrowing rates that he </p><p>took out newspaper advertisements in July 2002 arguing </p><p>"it is lending rates which will stimulate the economy." </p><p>He still insists the GOZ could turn this near-comatose </p><p>economy around by dropping lending rates from 75 to 25 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) No need to recite elementary economic theory </p><p>here.  Suffice it to say the economy has already milked </p><p>any growth benefits from cheap financing.  Now it is </p><p>suffering the more damaging consequences of:  a) capital </p><p>flight to safe investment venues (banks in neighbor South </p><p>Africa offer some of the world\'s highest real interest </p><p>rates), b) resource diversion to unproductive activities, </p><p>c) GOZ addiction to low-interest debt and d) depletion of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s once enviable savings rate.  In sum, negative </p><p>real interest rates have been a major cause of the </p><p>plummeting Zimdollar.  Sadly, it is unclear whether a </p><p>post-Mugabe GOZ will be able to float interest rates </p><p>upward while protecting vulnerable companies and </p><p>homeowners. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
