END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DURING MAY 28 SECURITY COUNCIL INFORMAL </p><p>CONSULTATIONS, THE SWEDISH, COSTA RICAN, JAPANESE, </p><p>BRAZILIAN AND OTHER DELEGATIONS RAISED THE PAKISTANI </p><p>NUCLEAR TESTS.  THEY SAID THE PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR </p><p>CAPABILITIES BY INDIA AND PAKISTAN WAS A THREAT TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND CALLED ON THE COUNCIL </p><p>PRESIDENT TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS "AT A </p><p>MINIMUM."  AMBASSADOR RICHARDSON AND RUSSIAN PERMREP </p><p>LAVROV AGREED.  THE COUNCIL MUST ACT QUICKLY, HE SAID, </p><p>BUT THE REACTION SHOULD BE A BALANCED, CAREFUL ONE.  HE </p><p>RECOMMENDED A PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ALONG THE LINES OF </p><p>THE ONE CONCERNING INDIA, ISSUED MAY 14.  HE CIRCULATED </p><p>A DRAFT STATEMENT WORKED OUT WITH THE U.S. DELEGATION. </p><p>THE DRAFT TEXT IS BASED ON THE 14 MAY STATEMENT AND THE </p><p>TEXT OF A SUBSEQUENT U.S./RUSSIAN DRAFT (WHICH HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN INTRODUCED) THAT CALLS FOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN INDIA </p><p>AND PAKISTAN.  AMBASSADOR RICHARDSON SUPPORTED </p><p>IMMEDIATE ADOPTION OF THE STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CALLS FOR MORE-ENCOMPASSING COUNCIL ACTION </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AMBASSADOR OWADA (JAPAN) SAID THAT IN ADDITION </p><p>TO ACTION ON THE PAKISTANI NUCLEAR TEST, THE COUNCIL </p><p>SHOULD ADDRESS THE COMBINED EFFECT OF BOTH INDIA\'S AND </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S NUCLEAR EFFORTS.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL -- </p><p>AND THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- MUST NOW </p><p>BEGIN TO LOOK AT NON-PROLIFERATION ISSUES IN A NEW </p><p>WAY.  THE COUNCIL MUST BEGIN CONSIDERATION OF A </p><p>RESOLUTION THAT CONVEYS THIS BROADER VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AMBASSADOR DAHLGREN (SWEDEN AGREED WITH NEED </p><p>FOR URGENT COUNCIL ACTION.  HE SAID HE HAD INSTRUCTIONS </p><p>TO PUSH FOR A SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>(SWEDISH/JAPANESE DRAFT RESOLUTION FAXED TO IO/UNP.) </p><p> </p><p>RICHARDSON CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  AMBASSADOR RICHARDSON SAID THAT PAKISTAN\'S </p><p>DECISION TO DETONATE A NUCLEAR DEVICE WAS A "LOST </p><p>OPPORTUNITY."  HE RECOUNTED INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. </p><p>EFFORTS TO AVOID THE PRESENT CRISIS.  WHAT WAS NEEDED </p><p>NOW WAS RAPID, CONCRETE ACTION.  INDIA AND PAKISTAN </p><p>MUST SIGN THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY, BEGIN A </p><p>DIALOGUE, AND REVERSE THE ARMS RACE THEY STARTED.  IN </p><p>THE MEANTIME, THE COUNCIL NEEDS TO RESPOND TO THE </p><p>PAKISTANI TEST TODAY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ONLY THE CHINESE RESISTED.  IN A MORNING </p><p>MEETING OF EXPERTS, THEY ATTEMPTED TO MODIFY THE </p><p>LANGUAGE TO SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD THE </p><p>INDIANS.  NO DELEGATION ACCEPTED THEIR PROPOSALS.  IN </p><p>AFTERNOON CONSULTATIONS, THEY AGAIN ARGUED THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS FROM BEIJING.  IN A </p><p>SUBSEQUENT P-5 MEETING, THE CHINESE AGREED AD REF TO A </p><p>TEXT.  THE COUNCIL CONVENED AT LO:30 P.M. TO APPROVE </p><p>IT, BUT THE CHINESE SAID THAT, IN SPITE OF HAVING MADE </p><p>A POSITIVE RECOMMENDATION TO BEIJING, THEY STILL HAD NO </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS TO AGREE.  THEY MADE NO SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>OBJECTIONS.  THE COUNCIL WILL RECONVENE MAY 29 A.M. </p><p>(TEXT AT PARA 11 BELOW.) </p><p> </p><p>STATEMENT BY SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  BEGIN SYG\'S STATEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>I DEPLORE BOTH THE INDIAN AND PAKISTANI TESTS.  THEY </p><p>EXACERBATE TENSION IN AN ALREADY DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>I CALL ON BOTH GOVERNMENTS TO SIGN THE COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>TEST BAN TREATY.  THEY MIGHT ALSO SIGN A NO-FIRST-USE </p><p>PLEDGE WITH EACH OTHER. </p><p> </p><p>FINALLY, BOTH NATIONS SHOULD FREEZE THEIR NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.  THE NUMBER OF NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS SHOULD DECREASE, NOT INCREASE. </p><p> </p><p>AS WE APPROACH THE NEW CENTURY, WE SHOULD BE ASKING HOW </p><p>BEST TO PRESERVE LIFE, CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION, NOT </p><p>HOW TO BECOME MORE DESTRUCTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>END SYG STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRESS STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) BEGIN PRESS STATEMENT OF COUNCIL PRESIDENT: </p><p> </p><p>THE COUNCIL STRONGLY DEPLORED THE TWO UNDERGROUND </p><p>NUCLEAR TESTS CONDUCTED BY PAKISTAN ON 28 MAY 1998, </p><p>DESPITE THE INTERNATIONAL CALL FOR RESTRAINT.THEY </p><p>CALLED UPON PAKISTAN AND INDIA TO STOP ALL NUCLEAR </p><p>TESTING AND RELATED ACTIVITY IMMEDIATELY.  THE COUNCIL </p><p>IS WORKING ON A FORMAL REACTION IN THE FORM OF A </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT PROBABLY TODAY. </p><p> </p><p>END SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT\'S PRESS STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>DRAFT PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT TEXT </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  THE LATEST DRAFT PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT TEXT </p><p>FOLLOWS:: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN DRAFT STATEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL STRONGLY DEPLORES THE UNDERGROUND </p><p>NUCLEAR TESTS THAT PAKISTAN CONDUCTED ON 28 MAY 1998, </p><p>DESPITE OVERWHELMING INTERNATIONAL CONCERN AND CALLS </p><p>FOR RESTRAINT.  REAFFIRMING ITS 14 MAY PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>STATEMENT (S/PRST/12) ON THE INDIAN NUCLEAR TESTS OF 11 </p><p>AND 13 MAY, THE SECURITY COUNCIL STRONGLY URGES INDIA </p><p>AND PAKISTAN TO REFRAIN FROM ANY FURTHER TESTS.  IT IS </p><p>OF THE VIEW THAT TESTING BY INDIA AND THEN BY PAKISTAN </p><p>IS CONTRARY TO THE DE FACTO MORATORIUM ON THE TESTING </p><p>OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR OTHER NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, </p><p>AND TO GLOBAL EFFORTS TOWARDS NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION </p><p>AND NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT.  THE COUNCIL ALSO EXPRESSES </p><p>ITS CONCERN AT THE EFFECTS OF THIS DEVELOPMENT ON PEACE </p><p>AND STABILITY IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL REAFFIRMS THE CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION ON NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS (NPT) AND THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY </p><p>(CTBT).  THE COUNCIL APPEALS TO INDIA AND PAKISTAN, AND </p><p>ALL OTHER STATES WHICH HAVE NOT YET DONE SO, TO BECOME </p><p>PARTIES TO THE NPT, AND TO THE CTBT, WITHOUT DELAY AND </p><p>WITHOUT CONDITIONS.  THE COUNCIL ALSO ENCOURAGES INDIA </p><p>AND PAKISTAN TO PARTICIPATE, IN A POSITIVE SPIRIT, IN </p><p>THE PROPOSED NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER STATES FOR A </p><p>FISSILE MATERIAL CUT-OFF TREATY IN GENEVA WITH A VIEW </p><p>TO REACHING EARLY AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL CALLS UPON ALL PARTIES TO EXERCISE </p><p>MAXIMUM RESTRAINT AND TO TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO REDUCE </p><p>AND REMOVE TENSIONS BETWEEN THEM.  THE COUNCIL </p><p>REAFFIRMS THAT THE SOURCES OF TENSION IN SOUTH ASIA </p><p>SHOULD BE REDUCED AND ELIMINATED ONLY THROUGH PEACEFUL </p><p>DIALOGUE AND NOT BY THE USE OF FORCE OR OTHER MILITARY </p><p>MEANS. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL URGES INDIA AND PAKISTAN TO RESUME </p><p>THEIR DIALOGUE ON ALL OUTSTANDING BILATERAL ISSUES, </p><p>INCLUDING ALL THOSE THAT THE PARTIES HAVE ALREADY </p><p>DISCUSSED, IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE TENSIONS BETWEEN THEM </p><p>AND TO ENHANCE THEIR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>COOPERATION.  THE COUNCIL CALLS UPON INDIA AND PAKISTAN </p><p>TO AVOID ANY STEPS OR STATEMENTS THAT COULD LEAD TO </p><p>FURTHER INSTABILITY OR IMPEDE THEIR BILATERAL DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL WILL REMAIN SEIZED OF THE MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>END DRAFT PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>RICHARDSON </p><p></p></div>
