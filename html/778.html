HE MADE </p><p>A STRONG PLEA FOR LAW AND ORDER, CONDEMNING THE "CRIMINAL </p><p>ELEMENTS" WHICH HAD VIOLATED THE LAW IN THE KRAJINA. </p><p>TUDJMAN NOTED THAT CROATIA HAS BECOME A REGIONAL POWER, </p><p>CREATING AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES\' PEACE </p><p>INITIATIVE COULD OPERATE.  TUDJMAN SAID CROATIA WAS </p><p>WILLING TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER NATIONS AS AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>STATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.
