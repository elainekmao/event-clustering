Significant truck delays at the </p><p>Turkish border have recently been addressed by changing the </p><p>Peshmerga "parking fee" from Swiss dinars to U.S. dollars. </p><p>Government fuel pumps in the north are now charging </p><p>customers in old Iraqi dinars, i.e., Saddam dinars, under an </p><p>agreement with the Coalition, marking the first time this </p><p>currency has been used in the north since 1991.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THREE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  As previously reported, since last fall the three </p><p>northern Governorates of Dahuk, Arbil, and As Sulaymaniyah </p><p>received single rations of wheat flour whereas central/south </p><p>received double rations each month.  Further compounding the </p><p>differences between the north and central/south, even the </p><p>single rations of wheat flour in February and March were not </p><p>complete in the north, meaning that people either received </p><p>less than the full one month\'s ration of wheat flour or that </p><p>some areas received no wheat flour at all.  In contrast, all </p><p>central/south governorates have received wheat flour rations </p><p>through July, and most in central/south have now received </p><p>the August ration of wheat flour.  (Note:  Some governorates </p><p>in central/south have even received wheat flour and other </p><p>commodities through October.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  Since April, the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) has been </p><p>working to address the northern shortfalls in wheat flour, </p><p>and it is currently being distributed in the three northern </p><p>governorates for May.  The distributions are approximately </p><p>30 percent complete.  Beans and vegetable oil are being </p><p>distributed for June/July; rice, tea, and sugar have been </p><p>distributed through July.  There is currently no weaning </p><p>cereal, infant formula, soap, or detergent available. </p><p>Although this distribution is being billed as the official </p><p>June countrywide ration, northern beneficiaries know they </p><p>are still behind central/south, as evidenced by their ration </p><p>cards.  The DART reports, however, that distributions are </p><p>proceeding smoothly. </p><p> </p><p>4.  To address the discontentment among the population of </p><p>the three northern governorates caused by their knowledge </p><p>that they have received less than the rest of the country, </p><p>WFP is beginning to put the word out that because </p><p>central/south experienced a higher amount of turmoil and </p><p>looting during and after the war, it is fair that they have </p><p>recently received additional commodities. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The DART reports that the population in the three </p><p>northern governorates is extremely happy to be receiving </p><p>better quality commodities, as there had been a number of </p><p>complaints over the years about the quality of rice and </p><p>sometimes also flour.  They are especially pleased to </p><p>receive vegetable oil rather than ghee for the first time. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>NINAWA GOVERNORATE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  The public distribution system (PDS) should begin in </p><p>Ninawa Governorate on or about 3 June with wheat flour and </p><p>sugar.  Distributions of other commodities will follow as </p><p>they are received.  WFP is especially pleased with strong </p><p>Coalition and Ministry of Trade (MOT) support, and believes </p><p>the distributions should go fairly smoothly, pending </p><p>availability of all commodities.  The fraudulent 40- </p><p>commodity public distribution system (PDS) list, which </p><p>apparently originated in Mosul, does not appear to be </p><p>affecting distribution preparations at this time.  Mosul </p><p>residents have reported that they have seen television </p><p>notices regarding the USD 105 per metric ton (MT) as the </p><p>sale price for the wheat harvest, but no details were given </p><p>about procedures. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In the contested areas, such as Ninawa-Dahuk (e.g., </p><p>Shekhan) and Ninawa-Arbil (e.g., Makhmur), the food agents </p><p>will continue to pick up their rations from the same points </p><p>as before, which in general is Mosul.  WFP believes that </p><p>approximately 400,000 people would be affected in making </p><p>changes to the current boundaries.  Such a major shift would </p><p>involve a massive operation to alter ration cards, something </p><p>WFP wants to avoid at this time.  Once the border issues are </p><p>officially resolved, ration cards can be changed </p><p>accordingly, if in fact, the PDS is still providing a ration </p><p>to every Iraqi at that point. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>AT\'TAMIM GOVERNORATE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  In At\'Tamim Governorate, the PDS was scheduled to begin </p><p>on 5 June in Kirkuk with wheat flour and sugar.  As in </p><p>Mosul, distributions of other commodities will follow as </p><p>they are received.  Unfortunately, Kirkuk is less prepared </p><p>than Mosul to re-start the PDS.  The Kurdish authorities </p><p>installed new MOT managers who had with little experience </p><p>and no institutional knowledge of the PDS.  Even so, WFP was </p><p>trying to work with the former managers, and reported that </p><p>Coalition forces had not taken a strong stand to support the </p><p>positions of the old managers leading up to the June </p><p>distribution.  The DART reports that on 2 June, Coalition </p><p>forces reinstated the previous head of the MOT, and assigned </p><p>the Kurdish man from As Sulaymaniyah to be the deputy.  WFP </p><p>and the DART feel this appointment will be helpful in </p><p>getting the PDS on track in At\'Tamim. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SALAH AD DIN GOVERNORATE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  WFP is storing some commodities for Tikrit in Dahuk, and </p><p>last week, WFP began delivering food directly to Tikrit, </p><p>using commercial trucks.  On 30 May, the DART traveled to </p><p>Tikrit, where Civil Military Operations Center (CMOC) </p><p>personnel noted that they had deemed the city\'s security </p><p>status permissive.  However, with Tikrit being the last </p><p>governorate capital to become permissive, it is behind the </p><p>rest of the country in PDS preparations.  (Note:  Not all </p><p>parts of Salah ad Din Governorate have been declared </p><p>permissive.)  For the U.N., however, Tikrit remains off </p><p>limits.  The DART urged the U.N. Security Coordinator </p><p>(UNSECOORD) to conduct a security assessment of Tikrit, </p><p>which took place on 4 June.  WFP international logistics and </p><p>program staff hope to access the area on or about 7 June. </p><p> </p><p>10.  On 3 June, the DART returned to Tikrit and met with </p><p>Coalition forces (including the U.S. military governor and </p><p>Civil Affairs [CA] personnel), WFP national staff, and the </p><p>MOT head of the food department.  WFP currently has </p><p>approximately 10,000 MT of stocks in Tikrit: 5,500 MT wheat </p><p>flour (almost enough for June), 4,035 MT rice, and </p><p>approximately 600 MT of lentils.  In addition, the MOT has </p><p>enough tea and soap for the June distribution and very large </p><p>stocks of sugar.  The MOT also expects to receive 950 MT </p><p>ghee or vegetable oil, 450 MT detergent, and 40 MT infant </p><p>formula in the coming days from southern Iraq.  Beans will </p><p>still be somewhat short, and beneficiaries in Tikrit prefer </p><p>beans to lentils.  The DART will be discussing beans options </p><p>with WFP for the July distribution.  This will be dependent, </p><p>however, on availability of other types of beans. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The WFP Tikrit national staff team leader (a Ph.D.- </p><p>holding former diplomat) and his team were found to be doing </p><p>an excellent job managing both the commodities and relations </p><p>with Coalition forces and the MOT -- despite lacking any </p><p>supervision, communication, or transport.  The public </p><p>distribution is scheduled to begin in Salah Ad Din </p><p>Governorate on or about 5 June, and is expected to proceed </p><p>rather smoothly, according to Coalition forces and WFP </p><p>sources, given the continuity and competence of most MOT </p><p>staff in the Governorate.  The arrival of WFP international </p><p>staff will build on the strong MOT and WFP team already in </p><p>place. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Coalition forces are guarding MOT stocks with soldiers </p><p>and three armored personnel carriers.  However, WFP\'s </p><p>warehouses at the grain silo are not yet protected.  DART </p><p>and CA personnel impressed upon the governor the importance </p><p>of having Coalition forces guard the WFP stores, and he </p><p>agreed to follow up. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Among other issues raised, the governor noted the </p><p>importance of salary payments for ex-soldiers, many of whom </p><p>had abandoned their posts as directed by Coalition forces. </p><p>The governor felt this to be particularly important in an </p><p>area such as Tikrit, where a large percentage of the </p><p>population served in the former military.  Regarding this </p><p>and a number of other issues that were raised, Coalition </p><p>forces in Tikrit believe that opening an Office of the </p><p>Coalition Provisional Authority (OCPA) in Tikrit would be </p><p>especially beneficial to them and to the area.  The DART is </p><p>following up with OCPA/North to arrange a Tikrit visit in </p><p>order to meet with military and other personnel there. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The Tikrit MOT Grain Board is functional, and is aware </p><p>of the USD 105 per MT wheat purchase price, but still awaits </p><p>detailed guidance from Baghdad regarding the procedures. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>PROBLEMS AT THE TURKISH BORDER </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  Recently, Turkish drivers protested the rising fees </p><p>they had been forced to pay the Peshmergas as they enter </p><p>Iraq.  The protests caused huge delays at the border.  Due </p><p>to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar against the Swiss </p><p>dinars, the "parking fee" collected in Swiss dinars went </p><p>from USD 20 to USD 80 in recent days.  During the height of </p><p>the delays last weekend, there were 2,800 trucks blocked at </p><p>the border crossing.  On 1 June, the issue was resolved </p><p>between WFP and the local authorities with an agreement to </p><p>pay USD 20 for the parking fee at the border.  This saves </p><p>the truckers from having to change U.S. dollars to Swiss </p><p>dinars to pay the fee. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Government fuel pumps in the north are now charging </p><p>customers in old Iraqi dinars, i.e., Saddam dinars, under an </p><p>agreement with the Coalition.  This marks the first time </p><p>this currency has been used in the north since 1991.  (Note: </p><p>While government stations are using the Saddam notes, most </p><p>fuel is still sold or resold on city sidewalks in Swiss </p><p>dinars.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
