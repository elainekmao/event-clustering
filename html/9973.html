<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001509 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, DRL, PLEASE PASS TO USAID/ANE </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KCOR, NP, PINR, Human Rights, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION </p><p>CRITICIZED FOR CORRUPTION, MAOIST SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  National Human Rights Commission member </p><p>Indira Rana (please protect) has made serious allegations </p><p>against some of her fellow members, accusing them of gender </p><p>discrimination, corruption and bias in favor of the Maoists. </p><p>In a July 31 meeting, Rana claimed that Sushil Pyakurel, an </p><p>active member of Nepal\'s main communist party, maintains </p><p>close contact with Maoist political leader Baburam Bhattarai </p><p>and uses his position within the Commission to provide </p><p>information to the insurgents.  Rana also complained that the </p><p>Commission is channeling funds from some European donors to </p><p>leftist, CPN-UML-affiliated NGOs as well as using the money </p><p>for personal benefit.  Rana\'s complaints echo those by other </p><p>respected members of Nepal\'s political elite who believe some </p><p>of the many European donors are too sympathetic to the </p><p>Maoists.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 31, PolOff met with Indira Rana, one of five </p><p>members appointed by the King to sit on the National Human </p><p>Rights Commission.  In June, Rana had publicly aired her </p><p>disagreements with the other members of the Commission and </p><p>accused them of corruption, gender discrimination and </p><p>ineffectiveness.  According to Rana, the Commission Chairman </p><p>and former Supreme Court judge, Nayan Bahadur Khatri, is now </p><p>"in the pocket" of fellow Commission member Sushil Pyakurel </p><p>former head of INSEC, a Nepali human rights NGO, and a leader </p><p>of the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(CPN-UML).  Rana alleged that Pyakurel has offered Khatri a </p><p>Cabinet-level appointment should there be a UML-led </p><p>government.  Rana suggested that, along with Dr. Gauri </p><p>Shankar Lal Das, these three members tightly control the </p><p>activities of the Human Rights Commission.  The fifth member, </p><p>Kapil Shrestha, has been sidelined, with his responsibilities </p><p>curtailed, as a result of a sex scandal last year. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Rana claimed that Pyakurel is extremely sympathetic to </p><p>the Maoist cause, maintains close contact with Maoist </p><p>political leader Baburam Bhattarai, and uses his position </p><p>within the Commission to provide information to the </p><p>insurgents.  According to Rana, in late 2002, Pyakurel </p><p>harbored a Maoist leader who had been charged by the </p><p>Government of Nepal with serious crimes.  She claimed that, </p><p>after the Maoist was released on one charge and before the </p><p>police could re-arrest him on the other two charges, Pyakurel </p><p>himself drove to the courthouse, picked up the insurgent and </p><p>sheltered him in the Human Rights Commission building </p><p>overnight.  The next day, he drove the Maoist leader to the </p><p>house of a UML Member of Parliament.  Rana suspects that </p><p>Pyakurel has assisted other Maoist leaders, although he has </p><p>not again used the Commission building, perhaps because, Rana </p><p>said, she confronted him about the issue. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Over the following months, Rana became increasingly </p><p>vocal about the absence of administrative procedures and </p><p>oversight within the Commission.  According to Rana, Pyakurel </p><p>colluded with the Commission\'s Secretary on hiring staff for </p><p>the new Commission.  Together they rigged the examination </p><p>process in order to hire family members and UML-affiliated </p><p>contacts.  As a result, the staff is incompetent, Rana said, </p><p>and the Commission has had to hire computer and </p><p>administrative trainers -- the same people that had applied </p><p>for staff positions and been rejected. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Rana also witnessed impropriety with the Commission\'s </p><p>handling of donor funds.  Rana claimed that all donor </p><p>funding, but particularly that from Norway and Denmark, had </p><p>been channeled only to UML-affiliated NGOs and also had been </p><p>used for personal profit by other Commission members.  In </p><p>particular, she cited a Norwegian project worth USD 25,000 to </p><p>advance the status of dalit, or low-caste, members of </p><p>society.  Led by Kapil Shrestha, the project produced no </p><p>results, she said, noting that Shrestha did not even provide </p><p>a written report of the project. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Rana also believed that Pyakurel Lal Das and Khatri </p><p>have used donor funding for extensive traveling.  She </p><p>mentioned that the new Secretary to the Commission, Kadar </p><p>Poudel had gone abroad nine times in the past nine months. </p><p>The other members of the Commission regularly spend weekends </p><p>at nice hotels for so-called "retreats," she said.  Rana also </p><p>mentioned that Pyakurel allocates himself 10,000 Rupees per </p><p>diem for his travel within Nepal as compared with the </p><p>standard GON per diem of 1,000 Rupees.  After Rana questioned </p><p>the appropriateness of this higher per diem, Pyakurel claimed </p><p>that, as a politician, he must "wine and dine" political </p><p>contacts and, therefore, required more per diem.  Rana also </p><p>noted that, before working as head of INSEC, Pyakurel was </p><p>poor.  Now, however, he owns two homes in Kathmandu as well </p><p>as two rental properties, she said. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) After months of observing and criticizing this </p><p>behavior, Rana said she became increasingly sidelined by the </p><p>Commission\'s Chairman, Pyakurel and Lal Das.  Her </p><p>responsibilities have been taken over by Pyakurel and she is </p><p>no longer invited to meetings nor is she permitted to see the </p><p>Commission\'s budget or minutes of the meetings.  Rana\'s </p><p>responsibility for overseeing the prison system is now </p><p>conducted by Pyakurel   Rana claimed that Pyakurel uses his </p><p>visits to prisons in order to meet jailed Maoist cadres and </p><p>later provides information to the Maoist leadership on their </p><p>status.  Pyakurel also uses his visits to RNA and police </p><p>posts to provide sensitive information to the Maoist </p><p>leadership, she claimed. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Biographic note:  Indira Rana is a well-respected </p><p>lawyer and dynamic human rights activist.  She received an </p><p>MPH in Law and Population from Harvard University.  Rana has </p><p>served the Government of Nepal for 35 years in many </p><p>capacities, including Secretary to the Judicial Council and </p><p>Judicial Service Commission, District Court Judge and as an </p><p>advocate to the Supreme Court.  She is an activist for human </p><p>rights and women\'s empowerment and has traveled extensively </p><p>for conferences related to women, law and criminal justice. </p><p>Rana was a member of the international election observation </p><p>team for the 1999 Presidential election in Sri Lanka.  She is </p><p>unmarried and her English is very good.  End Biographic note. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment.  Indira Rana\'s reports on the Commission\'s </p><p>misuse of donor funds and Maoist sympathies could be </p><p>motivated, in part, by her resentment at being marginalized </p><p>and isolated.  However, her allegations are consistent with </p><p>other reports Post has received.  In fact, the Commission to </p><p>Investigate Abuses of Authority is examining a case against </p><p>Pyakurel for improper use of funds.  Sadly, many of the other </p><p>self-proclaimed human rights organizations in Nepal suffer </p><p>from similar problems of corruption, nepotism and political </p><p>partisanship. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment Continued:  The National Human Rights </p><p>Commission, encouraged and supported by donor countries since </p><p>its inception in 2000, appears to be totally dysfunctional. </p><p>Its bias toward the Maoists has made it unsuitable as a </p><p>mediating institution in peace talks between the government </p><p>and Maoists.  Post is particularly concerned that European </p><p>donor governments could harm the peace process by channeling </p><p>funds through organizations like the Human Rights Commission </p><p>without providing sufficient oversight to ensure that the </p><p>funds are not used in direct support of the Maoists.  In </p><p>fact, Post has learned that certain European donors are </p><p>pushing the GON to authorize the Commission to monitor all </p><p>violations of the cease-fire code of conduct.  While such a </p><p>monitoring mechanism is probably a good idea, Post does not </p><p>believe the Commission can effectively or fairly play this </p><p>role.  Rana\'s complaints echo those by other respected </p><p>members of Nepal\'s political elite who believe many European </p><p>donors are too sympathetic to the Maoists (septel), giving </p><p>the rebels a false sense of international acceptability that </p><p>aggravates their aggressiveness in talks with the GON.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
