<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001759 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR CA/OCS/CI, CA/OCS/ACS/EAP, CA/OCS/PRI, </p><p>CA/VO/F/P AND EAP/BCLTV, L/EAP, Bangkok for DHS/DD, Ho Chi </p><p>Minh City for CONS and DHS OIC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KOCI, CVIS, CASC, PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM:  MEETING WITH JUSTICE MINISTRY ON </p><p>ADOPTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) Diplomatic Note, Vann-Savage email June 19th, 2003, </p><p> </p><p>B) draft Protocol, Vann-Savage email June 19th, 2003, C) </p><p>State 177624 and previous </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Summary.  Consul delivered the diplomatic note and </p><p>revised protocol (refs A and B) to Ministry of Justice (MOJ) </p><p>official on July 1.   The official noted that the relevant </p><p>section in MOJ that handles adoptions is reorganizing.  It </p><p>is possible that this reorganization will cause delays and </p><p>backtracking.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>DIPNOTE </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Consul delivered the Embassy\'s diplomatic note (ref </p><p>A) and the revised "Protocol" on adoptions (ref B) to Mr. </p><p>Binh, Vice Director of the International Cooperation of MOJ </p><p>on July 1, 2003.  She expressed the USG\'s hope to move </p><p>forward carefully, but as quickly as possible to reach </p><p>concurrence on a document that will protect the interests of </p><p>the children and adoptive parents alike. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In turning over the diplomatic note, Consul briefly </p><p>highlighted the reasons why the USG is required to work </p><p>towards some form of document other than an "agreement." </p><p>She requested confirmation in writing from the MOJ that a </p><p>document other than a bilateral agreement will be </p><p>acceptable.  She also stated that the diplomatic note </p><p>verifies the authority of employees of the US Embassy and </p><p>Consulate to negotiate this document with the guidance of </p><p>the Ambassador and certain offices of the USG.  In addition, </p><p>Consul encouraged the GVN to accede to the Hague Convention </p><p>on International Adoptions. </p><p> </p><p>NEW DRAFT PROTOCOL </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) At the same meeting Consul delivered the new draft </p><p>(ref B) noting its new title ("protocol") and more formal </p><p>format.  She also told Binh about the extensive references </p><p>to US and GVN laws which confirm the legal authority of this </p><p>document and that it will be fully acceptable throughout the </p><p>USG. </p><p> </p><p>REACTION </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Binh said that he would study the documents with the </p><p>relevant authorities from other ministries, and respond. </p><p>Binh welcomed the diplomatic note and the suggestion of a </p><p>new title and format for the document.  He also agreed that </p><p>the best way to negotiate is with Embassy officials.  As </p><p>reported earlier, he confirmed that negotiations are carried </p><p>out at the expert level (first round), government level </p><p>(designated by the Prime Minister), and state level </p><p>(designated by the President).  Acquiring GVN designation </p><p>for the government and state level rounds is a lengthy </p><p>process.  According to Binh, the most critical negotiation </p><p>is the first negotiation at the expert level, and he is </p><p>hopeful that negotiations can be completed in this round. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Binh promised that the relevant authorities would </p><p>study the Protocol at earliest time possible, but he noted </p><p>that due to an ongoing reorganization at MOJ, getting </p><p>attention to the document might take a bit longer than </p><p>usual. </p><p> </p><p>REORGANIZING AT MOJ </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) During the meeting, Binh described the ongoing </p><p>reorganization of the international adoptions function at </p><p>MOJ.  He stated that his Department, International </p><p>Cooperation, would be divided into 3 bureaus - International </p><p>Relations, International Law, and a Bureau for International </p><p>Adoptions, according to Decree 62, which was issued </p><p>approximately two weeks ago.  (A copy will be provided </p><p>separately.)  This decree will be effective as of July 12, </p><p>2003.  He noted that the reorganization is still unclear and </p><p>MOJ will have to issue decisions stipulating the structures, </p><p>rights and responsibilities of these new offices.  The </p><p>Bureau of International Adoptions will be responsible for </p><p>negotiating and signing adoption `agreements\'.  Until July </p><p>12th, Binh will remain responsible for adoptions </p><p>negotiations.  Binh thinks that because thus far he has only </p><p>worked as a negotiation team leader, he may not be assigned </p><p>to the new Bureau.  He does believe that even if not </p><p>assigned permanently, he will be asked to serve as an </p><p>advisor and consultant for the Bureau during its first days. </p><p>Binh stated that although the structure of MOJ is changing, </p><p>work continues. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Comment.  This reorganization may cause delays and </p><p>backtracking, particularly if written confirmation of GVN </p><p>willingness to proceed on a document that is not an </p><p>"agreement" is not received by the July 12th changeover </p><p>date.  A worst-case scenario would be that we have to start </p><p>over again at square one.  The GVN is known to change its </p><p>mind from day-to-day with the only rationale being, `that </p><p>was yesterday, this is today\'.  Until a decision is </p><p>confirmed in writing, it cannot be taken as a certainty. </p><p>Delays will certainly occur as new staff are identified and </p><p>get up to speed.  Mission intends to update adoptions </p><p>information on our websites to reflect the likelihood of </p><p>increased delays before any potential protocol can be signed </p><p>with the GVN.  End comment. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
