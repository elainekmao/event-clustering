<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002544 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EPET, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. OIL FIRMS COULD GET SQUEEZED </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2397 </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Summary: Indigenous firms are pressing the GoZ to let </p><p>them take over business from foreign oil firms, according to </p><p>Mobil officials.  However, the company reps were subsequently </p><p>encouraged by subsequent GoZ assurances on Tuesday that </p><p>multinational investment should be protected. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Fuel Import: Transition to What? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) Mobil officials updated Amb Sullivan and econoff on </p><p>developments since President Mugabe announced two weeks ago </p><p>that the GoZ can no longer subsidize fuel imports (ref). </p><p>Through parastatal NOCZIM, Zimbabwe currently absorbs about </p><p>90 percent of the fuel cost, enabling operators to sell </p><p>unleaded gas for about U.S.$.16/gallon.  Since Mugabe\'s </p><p>remarks, Energy Minister Nicholus Kitikiti has hosted a </p><p>series of meetings with the 5 multinationals and 16 </p><p>indigenous operators.  According to Mobil, these encounters </p><p>turned progressively rancorous, with indigenous firms </p><p>advocating fiercely for expanded market share and </p><p>multinationals insisting that they had to operate within </p><p>their existing framework agreement with Government. </p><p>Indigenous operators and ZANU-PF MP Philip Chiyanguta was </p><p>allocated major air time on state TV to argue that indigenous </p><p>operators should receive all of NOCZIM\'s fuel imports and </p><p>that multinationals should sell off their service stations to </p><p>indigenous operators.  Multinationals -- which include Mobil </p><p>(ExxonMobil) and Caltex (ChevronTexaco) -- walked out of a </p><p>Nov. 8 meeting that ended in a shouting match.  Indigenous </p><p>operators apparently accused the Energy Minister of </p><p>undermining Mugabe\'s new fuel policy.  In a separate meeting </p><p>without indigenous firms on Tuesday, the Minister apologized </p><p>and agreed that foreign investment should be protected. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Mobil reps were pleased by the Minister\'s reaction, </p><p>hoping it reflects a change-of-heart by President Mugabe </p><p>since they had in the interim passed their analysis to him in </p><p>a special channel.  However, they still fear the GoZ could </p><p>decide to subsidize fuel only for indigenous operators.  That </p><p>would mean gas stations owned by multinationals would sell </p><p>fuel for 6-10 times as much as those owned by locals setting </p><p>the stage for a poisonous situation.  As the lines for </p><p>cheaper fuel grew unbearable at indigenous stations, the GoZ </p><p>could argue that multinational stations were underutilized </p><p>and turn them over to local companies. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (C) Should such a scenario come to pass, Mobil reps </p><p>indicated they may ask the Embassy to "go to bat" for the </p><p>company.  While expropriation is only one of many scenarios, </p><p>an uncompensated expropriation of Mobil or Caltex assets </p><p>would be a grave matter.  As an additional complicating </p><p>factor, Mobil officials felt the 5 multinationals may not </p><p>remain unified throughout a shake-down, so conceivably Mobil </p><p>and Caltex could end up on different sides, as could Total, </p><p>BP and Shell. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In any event, we cannot emphasize enough the </p><p>seriousness of Zimbabwe\'s fuel shortage.  Companies are </p><p>currently being allocated about 50 percent of their needs by </p><p>NOCZIM.  Any international price increase resulting from a </p><p>Persian Gulf war would further exacerbate the crisis. Mobil </p><p>reps estimate that the GoZ\'s fuel subsidy presently costs US$ </p><p>30 million/month.  Annualized, that\'s as much as 8 percent of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s rapidly shrinking GDP.  Unless the GoZ can locate </p><p>a new source of fuel or foreign exchange, the subsidy is </p><p>unsustainable. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
