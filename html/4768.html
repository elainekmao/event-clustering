Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  In November 2002, the Government of </p><p>Turkey agreed to remove a number of non-tariff barriers on </p><p>banana imports in response to a WTO case initiated by the </p><p>Government of Ecuador.  Although the barriers were </p><p>eliminated, the GOT raised import tariffs by 29% from an </p><p>already high 120%.  Problems with Turkey\'s import regime </p><p>have also discouraged companies from investing in Turkey. </p><p>However, Turkey\'s eventual membership in the European Union </p><p>may revive interest in investment in the food sector.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>The Banana Wars </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On December 12, AgCounselor met with a banana </p><p>importer to discuss resolution/withdrawal of a WTO case </p><p>initiated by the Government of Ecuador against Turkey. Since </p><p>November 1999, companies had complained that the GOT has </p><p>restricted imports of bananas using a number of non-tariff </p><p>barriers.  Among the barriers used by Turkey were delays in </p><p>issuing certificates of control up to 45 days; issuing </p><p>licenses only for small uneconomical amounts (10,000 boxes </p><p>or 50 tons, in the case of bananas); and lastly, limiting </p><p>the time required for completing pesticide applications </p><p>which proved difficult for many importers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Let\'s go to Geneva </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In response to exporter complaints, Ecuador wanted </p><p>the WTO to address these issues.  Over the past two years, </p><p>Ecuador and Turkey had consulted on the issue. According to </p><p>one importer, the Ministry of Foreign Trade realized that </p><p>they would lose the case and might be  subject to sanctions. </p><p>As a result, in November 2002, the GOT agreed to eliminate </p><p>all the barriers.  However, as a concession to the Ministry </p><p>of Agriculture, the GOT raised tariffs on banana imports </p><p>from 120 percent to 149 percent which is Turkey\'s bound </p><p>rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Why We Have No Bananas </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The banana case illustrates the extent of the </p><p>GOT\'s desire to protect local industry.  Turkish banana </p><p>production meets only about 15 percent of total demand. </p><p>Given climate and soil conditions, Turkish producers cannot </p><p>significantly increase production to any great extent. </p><p>According to one importer, Turkey is now producing bananas </p><p>in green houses, which given energy costs is extremely </p><p>uneconomical.  In fact, the high tariffs penalize the </p><p>Turkish consumer who must pay more a great deal more for </p><p>bananas. Turkish producers generally increase their own </p><p>prices to those of the imported bananas and reap the </p><p>profits. Tariffs on other fruits (apples and pears) are </p><p>about 60 - 65 % and are applied seasonally.  It is </p><p>difficult, as far as importers are concerned, to see why a </p><p>country needs 149 or even 120 percent tax to protect its </p><p>industry.  The tariff is even more costly since the season </p><p>for bananas is only 3 months while the tariff remains in </p><p>place for the entire year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Effect still undetermined </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In 2001, banana imports decreased by 30 percent, </p><p>although this decline was attributed more to the economic </p><p>downturn rather than the tariffs.  The import problems have </p><p>discouraged companies from investing in any facilities in </p><p>Turkey.  Now, however given the possibility of Turkish EU </p><p>membership on the rise, companies may again explore the </p><p>possibility of investing in this market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Will the new government be better? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (SBU) There is a general feeling among traders that the </p><p>situation may improve with the new government. In November </p><p>2002 after the withdrawal of the non-tariff barriers, </p><p>certificates of control were issued in a week and for </p><p>unlimited quantities.  Pesticide requirements also have </p><p>become somewhat more flexible.  Under the previous </p><p>government, the MHP party viewed all imports as a threat to </p><p>Turkish agriculture.  Although the jury is still out, people </p><p>are hopeful that the situation will change for the better. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Comment: Agriculture - Problems but Hope for the Future? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) In general, the worst problems in U.S.-Turkish </p><p>bilateral trade are in the agriculture sector.  For the most </p><p>part, non-tariff barriers are more prevalent in agriculture </p><p>products versus industrial products.  The banana affair is </p><p>good example of Turkey\'s approach to trade.  The threat of </p><p>WTO action compelled the GOT to resolve the trade dispute. </p><p>Of course, in the case of bananas, it took the GOT 2 years </p><p>to reach that point.  At the same time, the GOT will often </p><p>go to great lengths to protect its domestic agriculture </p><p>often at the expense of the Turkish consumer who spends </p><p>close to 50% of his/her income on food.  Trade problems seem </p><p>to have discouraged foreign companies from investing in </p><p>Turkey fearing similar problems with Turkey\'s application of </p><p>investment rules.  It\'s a good sign that, at least </p><p>initially, companies believe that the new government will </p><p>create a more positive atmosphere for trade and investment. </p><p>In addition, potential EU membership may encourage companies </p><p>to invest here in the hope of basing food production and </p><p>processing facilities in Turkey to supply EU countries with </p><p>food products. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
