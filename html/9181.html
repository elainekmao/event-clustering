<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 001262 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, INR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINR, PREL, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: REPORT ON TRAVEL FROM CENTRAL NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT BOGGS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  On June 23-25, PolOff visited Bharatpur, </p><p>headquarters of Chitwan district in Nepal\'s central lowlands, </p><p>and Dhadingbesi, headquarters of Dhading district in the </p><p>central hills.  Officials in both districts reported that </p><p>Maoist activity, including extortion and training, continues. </p><p>Neither district has experienced clashes between the Maoists </p><p>and security forces since the cease-fire was declared in </p><p>January 2003.  Nine Village Development Committee (VDC) areas </p><p>in Chitwan and thirty VDCs in Dhading are considered </p><p>Maoist-affected, with most government buildings and many </p><p>telephone towers destroyed.  However, since the cease-fire, </p><p>government administration officials and most political party </p><p>leaders have been able to work in even the most remote areas. </p><p> District officials also reported that active Maoist cadres </p><p>have returned to their home areas to visit their families, </p><p>but stay for only a day or two before returning to their </p><p>post.  There is no indication that Maoist cadre are </p><p>reintegrating with the communities in either district.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Chitwan District </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Predominately flat jungle land in southern Nepal, </p><p>Chitwan is home to the Chitwan National Park, a popular </p><p>tourist destination.  With a population of roughly 400,000 </p><p>people, the district is comprised of 36 Village Development </p><p>Committee (VDC) areas, only nine of which are in Nepal\'s hill </p><p>region, and two municipalities (Bharatpur and Birendranagar). </p><p> Even the most remote VDC area is not more than one day\'s </p><p>walk from Bharatpur, the district headquarters.  (Note: </p><p>Before local officials\' terms lapsed in July 2002, Village </p><p>Development Committees were led by an elected Chairman and </p><p>Vice Chairman responsible for daily administration and </p><p>development project implementation within their VDC area. </p><p>Now, however, each VDC Area is being administered by the VDC </p><p>Secretary, a civil servant.  On June 30, Prime Minister Thapa </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>extended the VDC Secretaries\' mandate for an additional year. </p><p> End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>---  Maoist Activity  ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Chitwan\'s acting Chief District Officer (ACDO) Lok </p><p>Bahadur Khatri reported that the Maoists are most active in </p><p>the nine hilly VDC areas, mainly in training and extorting </p><p>money from local villagers and Nepalese involved in local </p><p>development projects.  Maoists also regularly harass </p><p>government vehicles traveling through the hill areas, </p><p>demanding payment for passage.  There were two cases of </p><p>Maoists stealing motorbikes from government workers.  More </p><p>seriously, Chitwan\'s Superintendent of Police Pratap Singh </p><p>Thapa reported hearing that the Maoists have recruited </p><p>several local villagers, but he was not sure if the people </p><p>were abducted forcefully or if they left voluntarily. </p><p>Superintendent Thapa said he could not file formal cases of </p><p>abduction because of lack of evidence.  Villagers are too </p><p>afraid to provide evidence against the Maoists, he said. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the hill areas where they are most active, the </p><p>Maoists typically stay in local villagers\' homes for one </p><p>night, moving on to a different village for the following </p><p>night, ACDO Khatri said.  As a security precaution, he </p><p>reported, the insurgents do not take food from the same house </p><p>in which they stay.  Khatri also claimed that Maoists, whose </p><p>families live in Chitwan, have returned for short visits (1-2 </p><p>days) during the cease-fire, but are not reintegrating with </p><p>their home communities.  Superintendent Thapa reported that </p><p>Maoist leaders Prachanda and Badal had returned twice to </p><p>their homes in Chitwan since the cease-fire took hold. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Superintendent Thapa also indicated that Maoist </p><p>activists hold regular demonstrations and cycle rallies in </p><p>the streets of Bharatpur and in villages.  But the </p><p>demonstrations last no more than 10 minutes, he said, and are </p><p>typically over by the time the police arrive.  Thapa said </p><p>that Maoists also held a mass meeting outside Bharatpur in </p><p>April to discuss their demands for a constituent assembly, </p><p>but attendance was low.  Through reports from the meeting, </p><p>Thapa heard the Maoists claim that "they will not return to </p><p>the jungle" and that "the current cease-fire must be </p><p>successful."  Thapa suspected that the Maoists and local </p><p>political party leaders have met secretly two or three times </p><p>since the cease-fire and cooperate informally on an ongoing </p><p>basis.  At the student level, the Maoists and the five </p><p>agitating political parties conduct joint protests, Thapa </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Thapa indicated that the Maoists in Chitwan appear to </p><p>be taking this cease-fire more seriously by operating more </p><p>openly than they did in the last cease-fire.  On the other </p><p>hand, Thapa later claimed that most of the Maoist cadres </p><p>remain underground, but estimated that perhaps 100 militants </p><p>were operating in the district with many more non-militant </p><p>Maoists also active in the district.  Thapa also said that </p><p>Maoist supporters (not active members) have been much less </p><p>vocal in their support of the Maoist cause during this </p><p>cease-fire compared with the first cease-fire. </p><p> </p><p>---- Security Forces and Local Administration ---- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Neither the police nor the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) have </p><p>a permanent presence in the nine hilly VDC areas, said </p><p>Khatri.  Superintendent Thapa reported that there are 400 </p><p>police officers at 15 posts in the district with 160 officers </p><p>in the two municipalities and the remaining 240 officers at </p><p>VDC-level posts.  Thapa explained that there is roughly one </p><p>police post for every 4 VDC areas, not including the hill </p><p>areas where there is no presence.  Thapa said, however, that </p><p>the police have conducted patrols in the Maoist-affected </p><p>areas since the cease-fire without incident.  The police have </p><p>conducted only two joint patrols with the RNA in Chitwan </p><p>since the cease-fire.  Two RNA battalions are present in </p><p>Chitwan, one in Bharatpur and one within the Chitwan National </p><p>Park. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Despite the lack of security forces, most Nepalese are </p><p>able to travel freely throughout the Maoist-affected areas, </p><p>which is a significant departure from before the cease-fire. </p><p> On June 11, district administration officials and National </p><p>Police and RNA officers provided social services, such as </p><p>road building and medical treatment, without incident. </p><p>(Note.  The RNA and Police have been carrying out social </p><p>welfare programs throughout the 75 Districts in Nepal. Some </p><p>have resulted in clashes with the Maoists.  End Note.) </p><p>Moreover, according to Khatri, all 36 VDC Secretaries are </p><p>present in the VDCs, although the nine Secretaries in the </p><p>hill areas return to Bharatpur at night.  All VDCs have </p><p>received the federal government\'s allotment of 250,000 rupees </p><p>for development projects, he said.  ACDO Khatri explained </p><p>that Chitwan\'s good road network keeps the Maoists confined </p><p>to the more remote, hill areas of the district. </p><p> </p><p>---- Political Parties ---- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) There are three active political parties in Chitwan: </p><p>Nepali Congress (NC), United-Marxist Leninist (UML) and </p><p>People\'s Front Nepal (PFN).  In the last elected government, </p><p>UML held 25 and NC held 11 of the 36 VDC Chairmanship </p><p>positions.  However, the four national level constituencies </p><p>were all won by Nepali Congress.  Nepali Congress District </p><p>President Krishna Lal Sapkota claimed that the UML held a </p><p>local-level majority only because of UML ballot rigging at </p><p>the 1997 elections. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) NC President Sapkota reported that the three </p><p>political parties present in Chitwan are conducting regular </p><p>protests at the district level based on the national </p><p>agitation program.  In addition, the party-affiliated student </p><p>unions are very active in Chitwan district and have been </p><p>participating in the national school lockout program.  He </p><p>said that Chitwan\'s Nepali Congress chapter has fully </p><p>supported the ongoing student strike.  Sapkota indicated that </p><p>party leaders in Chitwan are not able to travel to the remote </p><p>hill areas of the district due to fear of Maoist reprisals. </p><p>Sapkota cited an armed Maoist gathering held June 23 in one </p><p>of the hilly VDC areas: a dangerous situation for Nepali </p><p>Congress leaders, he said. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Sapkota claimed that government administration at the </p><p>district level was not running effectively, in part because </p><p>of political party agitation within the district.  He </p><p>complained of corruption within the current administration at </p><p>the VDC level, particularly in the selling of passports and </p><p>citizenship cards. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) United Marxist Leninist (UML) District Secretary Hari </p><p>Sapkota claimed the cease-fire was going very well in </p><p>Chitwan.  Contrary to the Nepali Congress report, the UML </p><p>Secretary suggested that UML party members could travel </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>freely throughout Chitwan district and had no fear at night </p><p>of Maoist reprisals.  Seemingly more sympathetic to the </p><p>Maoists, UML Secretary Sapkota claimed that the insurgents </p><p>were not extorting money from businesses or villagers in </p><p>Chitwan.  UML\'s support for the student union protests, he </p><p>said, was not strong in Chitwan, although 50 schools in </p><p>Chitwan have been closed on a trial basis.  He suggested that </p><p>the student unions, except for the Maoist-wing ANNISU-R, were </p><p>not as active in Chitwan as other districts. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Dhading District </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) In Dhadingbesi, district headquarters for Dhading </p><p>District, Poloff met with Chief District Officer Jeevan </p><p>Prasad Woli, Inspector of Police Gopi Man Shrestha and </p><p>leaders of all four active political parties: Nepali </p><p>Congress, RPP, UML and People\'s Front Nepal.  Dhading has a </p><p>population of 338,513 people within 50 VDC areas, 30 of which </p><p>are Maoist-affected.  All VDC administration and police </p><p>buildings, telephone towers and local phone booths in the 30 </p><p>Maoist-affected VDC areas were destroyed prior to the </p><p>cease-fire and have not been rebuilt.  Poloff later drove by </p><p>an Agriculture Development Office in Simile VDC area located </p><p>just off the main highway 30 kilometers outside the Kathmandu </p><p>Valley that the Maoists had destroyed by fire. </p><p> </p><p>---- Maoist Activity ---- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The CDO and Inspector of Police both described </p><p>northern Dhading district as a primary training ground for </p><p>newly recruited Maoist cadre.  Other ongoing Maoist activity </p><p>in Dhading includes recruitment and extortion.  The Maoists </p><p>reportedly demand from 500 to 2000 rupees (USD 6.70 to 26.70) </p><p>from villagers and local businesses, forcing them to accept </p><p>receipts and Maoist \'membership cards\' in return.  Maoists </p><p>also require all development programs, most of which are </p><p>funded by the central government, to pay a 5-10 percent </p><p>commission of the total cost of the program.  Only a small </p><p>handful of international NGOs operate in Dhading, including </p><p>the Red Cross and the NGO Federation (International Labor </p><p>Organization, Save the Children and the Asia Foundation) </p><p>working mainly on women and children issues, particularly </p><p>trafficking in persons.  Inspector Shrestha had no reports of </p><p>Maoists threatening these organizations. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Since the cease-fire took hold, CDO Woli reported, </p><p>Maoists whose homes are in Dhading have returned for short </p><p>visits with their families, but stay for only one or two </p><p>days.  There is no indication that Maoists are reintegrating </p><p>with local communities in Dhading.  Maoists have held two </p><p>large mass meetings in the district, one in Khahare in late </p><p>April and the second in the district headquarters of </p><p>Dhadingbesi in late May.  Approximately 200-300 people </p><p>attended both meetings, but most were forced to attend, </p><p>according to Inspector Shrestha.  The joint local government, </p><p>police and RNA program to provide social services on June 11 </p><p>went without incident, CDO Woli said. </p><p> </p><p>---- Security Forces and Local Administration ---- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) There are 250 Civilian Police officers and 200 RNA </p><p>soldiers in Dhading district.  During the last state of </p><p>emergency, the district\'s 26 police posts were consolidated </p><p>into only 3 posts in three of the main towns: Dhadingbesi, </p><p>Kanekhola and Ghajuri.  Police and RNA units conduct regular </p><p>and ongoing patrols throughout the district, Inspector </p><p>Shrestha said.  However, no clashes between security forces </p><p>and the Maoists have occurred in Dhading since the </p><p>cease-fire, he reported. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) The cease-fire has allowed government administration </p><p>officials and political party leaders to travel freely </p><p>throughout the District.  CDO Woli claimed that, since the </p><p>cease-fire, all VDC Secretaries and government officials from </p><p>the Ministry of Agriculture, the Postal Service and others </p><p>have been able to conduct their business with only slight </p><p>harassment by the Maoists.  Political party leaders averred, </p><p>however, that VDC Secretaries and other officials do not </p><p>spend the night in their VDC area due to fear of Maoist </p><p>reprisals.  All political parties in Dhadingbesi claimed they </p><p>could travel throughout Dhading during the day, but would </p><p>return to district headquarters at night. </p><p>18. (C) CDO Woli indicated that all schools in the district </p><p>are staffed, although many have only temporary teachers.  The </p><p>CDO requires all teachers to report to district headquarters </p><p>once every month in order to report on Maoist activity. </p><p>However, many teachers appear to be sympathetic with the </p><p>Maoists or are reluctant to provide the local government with </p><p>information for fear of reprisals, he said. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) Reports of ongoing extortion, recruitment and </p><p>training by the Maoists in Chitwan and Dhading districts </p><p>align with reports received from other districts in Nepal. </p><p>Clearly, government administration officials would like to </p><p>give the impression that they are able to administer </p><p>effectively to the people.  The reality is probably much less </p><p>sanguine.  Post suspects that in the Maoist affected areas, </p><p>particularly in Dhading, the insurgents are much more in </p><p>control -- or more disruptive -- in many areas than local </p><p>administrators claim.  This assessment is consistent with the </p><p>demonstrated absence of government offices at the local level </p><p>and the reluctance of villagers and teachers to cooperate </p><p>with government administrators.  However, at least the </p><p>cease-fire has brought relative stability and peace to </p><p>residents of Dhading and Chitwan as well as some hope for the </p><p>future.
