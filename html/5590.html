(SBU) Summary: Can there really have been 500,000 foreign </p><p>tourists, including 15,000 Americans, in Burma last year? </p><p>Despite the GOB\'s triumphant claims, we think not.  Evidence </p><p>from the local tourism industry, the Embassy\'s Consular </p><p>Section, and a measure of plain common sense, suggest a much </p><p>smaller number of U.S. tourists.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Americans Flocking to Burma? </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Burmese Ministry of Hotels and Tourism (MOHT) </p><p>recently trumpeted a victory for the 2002 tourist season. </p><p>The country, so the Ministry claimed, finally achieved the </p><p>long sought after goal of 500,000 foreign visitors.  Because </p><p>of severe shortages of flight capacity, and the very limited </p><p>tourist season, we are dubious of the overall numbers. </p><p>However, even if we take them at face value they are not as </p><p>impressive as they initially seem.  According to MOHT </p><p>accounts, there were 270,000 entries by travelers from China, </p><p>Thailand, Laos, and India who crossed the border by land for </p><p>a day or two.  Of the remaining 230,000 visitors, 218,000 </p><p>came by air from other Asian countries (including 23,000 from </p><p>Taiwan and 21,000 from Japan). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Ministry also took much pleasure in announcing an </p><p>alleged increase in U.S. visitors to Burma.  One of the </p><p>regime\'s newspapers, The Myanmar Times, reported, </p><p>"Surprisingly give (sic) the U.S. Government\'s harsh stance </p><p>on Myanmar; it was American tourists who visited most </p><p>frequently from the western nations" (about 14,500 entries in </p><p>2002 according to the MOHT).  Though this number is still </p><p>less than 3 percent of all purported visitors to Burma, it </p><p>would indicate a sharp increase in U.S. tourism to Burma over </p><p>the last three years. </p><p> </p><p>Wishful Thinking </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Though we have no way to conclusively verify or </p><p>disprove the MOHT\'s claims, we are very skeptical.  Tourism </p><p>from Europe may have increased, due to expanded flight </p><p>capacity in 2002 from Italy and Austria.  However, tourism </p><p>industry sources here say that the Burmese government has </p><p>been known to inflate the number of western tourist entries </p><p>for reasons of national pride and in order to bolster claims </p><p>of respectability.  Another possibility is that the MOHT </p><p>statistics were taken wholesale from the Immigration Service </p><p>with no effort to break them down by the visitors\' status or </p><p>length of stay.  Therefore U.S. passport holders who are </p><p>long-term residents of Burma would be counted as one </p><p>"visitor" each time they re-entered the country. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Embassy\'s consular statistics tend to bear out </p><p>these assumptions.  Only a couple of hundred U.S. citizens </p><p>registered at the Embassy in 2002 (a small percentage of the </p><p>alleged 14,500 at a time when U.S. travelers are eager to </p><p>register when they travel abroad).  In 2002 there was only a </p><p>single death of a U.S. citizen tourist, no arrests of U.S. </p><p>tourists, about 20 welfare/whereabouts cases involving </p><p>short-term U.S. visitors, and only four U.S. tourists seeking </p><p>a replacement passport.  If the 14,500 number were accurate, </p><p>these low consular data would make Burma a statistical </p><p>anomaly in the consular world. </p><p> </p><p>How Many Then? </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The accurate number of U.S. tourists, and overall </p><p>visitors to Burma, is impossible to know.  For evacuation </p><p>purposes, the Embassy recently made a very generous estimate </p><p>of 10,000 U.S. tourists in Burma during 2002.  Anecdotal </p><p>evidence from hoteliers and travel agents in Rangoon suggests </p><p>an even lower figure of around 7,000 or 8,000.  Whatever the </p><p>true number of tourists, it is even less important than the </p><p>small number the GOB claims.  In any case, the plain fact is </p><p>that U.S. tourism contributes very little to the Burmese </p><p>economy. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
