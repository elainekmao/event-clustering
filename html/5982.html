<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001303 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, PKK </p><p>SUBJECT: OCALAN\'S CONTINUED ISOLATION, POSSIBLE RETURN OF </p><p>OHAL COULD SPARK TROUBLE IN SOUTHEAST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 972 </p><p>     B. ADANA 44 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Relatives and attorneys remain unable to </p><p>visit jailed PKK leader Ocalan; the last visit took place </p><p>November 27.  The official GOT line is that stormy weather </p><p>has grounded the boat that takes visitors to Ocalan\'s island </p><p>prison, but some GOT officials privately acknowledge there </p><p>must be other factors at play.  Human rights and Kurdish </p><p>activists have protested the situation, and there has been a </p><p>series of demonstrations over Ocalan\'s situation, sometimes </p><p>involving violence.  GOT officials say the Government is </p><p>preoccupied with Iraq and Cyprus and is unlikely to address </p><p>the problem at this time.  Meanwhile, there are concerns that </p><p>a return to a state of emergency in the southeast in the </p><p>event of war in Iraq will further stir tensions in the </p><p>region.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Ocalan\'s Isolation Continues </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Jandarma officials continue to prevent lawyers and </p><p>relatives from visiting jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan; </p><p>the last such visit took place November 27 (reftels).  The </p><p>GOT maintains that stormy weather has grounded the boat used </p><p>to shuttle visitors every Wednesday to Imrali Island in the </p><p>Sea of Marmara, where Ocalan is the only prisoner.  The GOT </p><p>arranged for representatives of the European Committee for </p><p>the Prevention of Torture (CPT) to visit Ocalan by helicopter </p><p>February 17.  The CPT officials reported Ocalan to be in good </p><p>health, but told reporters they did not believe weather was </p><p>the sole reason for his isolation.  Demonstrations, sometimes </p><p>violent, protesting Ocalan\'s isolation continue across the </p><p>southeast (reftel B), as well as in Istanbul, Ankara and </p><p>other cities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>HRA Investigates </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Husnu Ondul, president of the Human Rights Association </p><p>(HRA), told Poloff February 26 that HRA investigated Ocalan\'s </p><p>situation at the request of relatives and attorneys.  Ondul </p><p>said he and other HRA officials met for one hour with the </p><p>Chief Public Prosecutor of Bursa, who has authority over the </p><p>Imrali prison.  The Jandarma commander in Gemlik, who </p><p>controls transportation to the island, refused to meet them. </p><p>Ondul noted the close ties between the Jandarma and the </p><p>Turkish General Staff (TGS), and argued that the military is </p><p>blocking access to Ocalan in a deliberate effort to stir </p><p>tension in the Kurdish community.  It is true that the </p><p>Marmara is often subject to high winds during the winter </p><p>months, but the Jandarma could easily guarantee access to </p><p>Ocalan by providing a larger boat.  While the small boat used </p><p>by Ocalan\'s visitors has been grounded the past three months, </p><p>thousands of Jandarma and prison officials have traveled to </p><p>the island in larger boats.  Ondul said the visitors\' boat is </p><p>unsafe for the five-hour trip to Imrali.  The Gemlik Jandarma </p><p>commander February 26 allowed visitors to set sail for Imrali </p><p>for the first time in three months, but the boat was forced </p><p>to turn back, supposedly because of high waves.  Two of </p><p>Ocalan\'s attorneys told Poloff the boat could have made the </p><p>trip. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Official GOT Line Appears Dubious </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Kaan Esener, head of the MFA\'s Department of Council </p><p>of Europe Affairs, insisted in a meeting with Poloff that </p><p>weather was the sole reason for Ocalan\'s isolation.  He </p><p>acknowledged Poloff\'s concerns about the demonstrations </p><p>sparked by the situation, and said he spent five days </p><p>arranging the CPT visit in an attempt to lower tensions.  He </p><p>said he believed attorneys and relatives might be able to </p><p>finally visit Ocalan March 5, though he declined to </p><p>elaborate.  However, Inan Ozyildiz, foreign affairs advisor </p><p>to the President, told Poloff separately the weather </p><p>explanation was "silly."  He speculated that the military </p><p>might be concerned about Ocalan passing messages to PKK </p><p>terrorists (Note: According to a press report, one of </p><p>Ocalan\'s Imrali-bound lawyers was caught February 26 carrying </p><p>PKK-related documents hidden inside a newspaper.  Ocalan </p><p>attorneys deny it.  End Note).  A Danish diplomat told Poloff </p><p>that, according to an AK Party contact, AK Chairman Erdogan </p><p>first learned of the Ocalan situation in mid-February and </p><p>angrily demanded it be resolved.  If so, his demand has been </p><p>studiously ignored. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>State of Emergency Could Return to Southeast </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ondul said he is also concerned about press reports </p><p>that the TGS has sent a letter to the Prime Ministry </p><p>recommending that a state of emergency be declared in six </p><p>southeastern provinces in the event of war in Iraq.  He said </p><p>the southeast had been under some form of martial law for 24 </p><p>years, and was finally freed when the state of emergency was </p><p>phased out November 30.  A return to curfews, roadblocks and </p><p>intrusive searches could snuff out the people\'s newfound hope </p><p>and bring back the tensions of the mid-90s.  Although a new </p><p>state of emergency would be tied to a war in Iraq, it could </p><p>easily be extended.  The previous state of emergency was </p><p>introduced as a temporary measure, but was renewed for years </p><p>at four-month intervals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ozyildiz and Esener -- as well as Interior Ministry </p><p>Secretary General Nazih Dogan -- asserted they are not aware </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>of a proposal for a war-related state of emergency, while </p><p>acknowledging such a move would not surprise them.  Despite </p><p>concerns about tensions in the southeast, Ozyildiz and Esener </p><p>claimed the Ocalan situation and the possibility of a state </p><p>of emergency are not among the GOT\'s main concerns at this </p><p>time.  Esener does not believe the Ocalan situation can be </p><p>resolved while so many other high-profile issues are on the </p><p>agenda.  "The government is worried about Iraq and Cyprus. </p><p>The last thing they want to hear about is Ocalan," he averred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) There is clearly more than weather behind the policy </p><p>of isolating Ocalan.  Speculation has centered on two </p><p>theories: 1) the military wants to prevent the PKK leader </p><p>from delivering messages; and 2) the military wants to </p><p>provoke conflict in order to justify a crackdown.  Both of </p><p>these arguments appear to carry weight with elements of the </p><p>TGS and Jandarma.  The people of Turkey\'s southeast do not </p><p>trust the government and will fear that any reimposition of a </p><p>state of emergency will mean a crackdown against them.  For </p><p>this reason, it is especially important for the GOT to allow </p><p>Ocalan\'s visits to resume and lower tensions.  Embassy will </p><p>continue to raise this issue with contacts. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
