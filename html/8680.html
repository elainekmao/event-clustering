<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 002663 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS APPOINTED HIS NUNCIO TO ERITREA, </p><p>ETHIOPIA AND DJIBOUTI, ARCHBISHOP SILVANO TOMASI (AN </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZEN), AS THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER AT </p><p>THE UN OFFICES AND SPECIALIST AGENCIES, AND TO THE WORLD </p><p>TRADE ORGANIZATION IN GENEVA.  TOMASI REPLACES ARCHBISHOP </p><p>DIARMUID MARTIN WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED TO DUBLIN, IRELAND </p><p>    AS AN ASSISTANT BISHOP WITH RIGHT OF SUCCESSION. </p><p> </p><p>2. SILVANO TOMASI WAS BORN IN CASONI DI MUSSOLENTE, IN THE </p><p>NORTHERN ITALIAN PROVINCE OF VICENZA ON OCTOBER 12, 1940. </p><p>HE ENTERED THE SEMINARY OF THE CONGREGATION OF THE </p><p>MISSIONARIES OF ST. CHARLES OR "SCALABRINIS" IN NEW YORK </p><p>CITY AND WAS ORDAINED A PRIEST IN 1965. (NOTE. THE </p><p>SCALABRINIS PROVIDE SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL CARE FOR </p><p>MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES.  THEY OPERATE IN 24 NATIONS ON ALL </p><p>FIVE CONTINENTS RUNNING SHELTERS FOR REFUGEES, MIGRANTS IN </p><p>TRANSIT, AND DEPORTED ALIENS.  THEY ALSO PROVIDE SEAFARER </p><p>CENTERS, RETIREMENT VILLAGES FOR ELDERLY MIGRANTS, AND </p><p>CENTERS FOR MIGRATION STUDIES.  THE SCALABRINIS ALSO </p><p>PUBLISH NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES AND PRODUCE RADIO AND </p><p>TELEVISION PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY FOR MIGRANT POPULATIONS. </p><p>END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>3. TOMASI HOLDS A DOCTORATE IN SOCIAL SCIENCES FROM NEW </p><p>YORK\'S FORDHAM UNIVERSITY.  FROM 1965 UNTIL 1974 HE WORKED </p><p>IN PAROCHIAL MINISTRY, LECTURED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE </p><p>CITY OF NEW YORK, WAS DIRECTOR OF NEW YORK\'S CENTER FOR </p><p>MIGRATION STUDIES AND EDITOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION </p><p>REVIEW.  FROM 1975-1980 AND 1987-1989 TOMASI SERVED AS </p><p>SUPERIOR OF THE NEW YORK PROVINCE (U.S. EAST COAST, CANADA, </p><p>VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA) OF THE SCALABRINI MISSIONARIES. IN </p><p>1983 HE BECAME THE FIRST DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. BISHOPS </p><p>CONFERENCE OFFICE FOR THE PASTORAL CARE OF MIGRANTS AND </p><p>REFUGEES.  TOMASI WAS CALLED TO ROME IN 1989 TO SERVE AS </p><p>SECRETARY (NUMBER TWO) AT THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PASTORAL CARE OF MIGRANTS AND ITINERANT PEOPLES.  POPE JOHN </p><p>PAUL II APPOINTED HIM AS NUNCIO IN ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA IN </p><p>    1996.  TOMASI WAS ORDAINED AN ARCHBISHOP THE SAME YEAR.  IN </p><p>2000 HIS ACCREDITATION WAS EXTENDED TO DJIBOUTI.  HE ALSO </p><p>SERVED AS THE HOLY SEE\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION FOR AFRICAN UNITY.  THE POPE NOMINATED HIM AS </p><p>THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER AT THE UN OFFICES AND </p><p>SPECIALIST AGENCIES AND TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION IN </p><p>GENEVA ON JUNE 10, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>4. COMMENT:  GIVEN ARCHBISHOP TOMASI\'S STRONG INTEREST IN </p><p>MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES, WE EXPECT HIM TO BE A FORCEFUL </p><p>ADVOCATE ON THOSE ISSUES AT THE UNHCR AND RELATED AGENCIES. </p><p>TOMASI, LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR MARTIN, STANDS OUT AMONG HOLY </p><p>SEE DIPLOMATS IN THAT HE DID NOT PASS THROUGH THE </p><p>ECCLESIASTICAL ACADEMY -- THE VATICAN\'S PRESTIGIOUS </p><p>DIPLOMATIC TRAINING SCHOOL.  HIS BACKGROUND IS MORE WITHIN </p><p>THE CHURCH\'S "GRASS ROOTS."  THE ARCHBISHOP IS KNOWN TO BE </p><p>A REALIST, BUT QUINTESSENTIALLY DIPLOMATIC.  HIS TERM IN </p><p>ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA HAS MADE HIM PARTICULARLY ATTUNED TO </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE SITUATION OF DEVELOPING NATIONS. </p><p>VATICAN WATCHERS SAY TOMASI WILL BRING FLAIR TO HIS WORK, </p><p>COMBINING AMERICAN REALISM WITH ITALIAN SUBTLETY -- TRAITS </p><p>THAT STOOD OUT WHEN HE SERVED ON THE HOLY SEE\'S ACTIVE </p><p>DELEGATION AT THE UN\'S 1994 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON </p><p>POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN CAIRO.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA02663 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
