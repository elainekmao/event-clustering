<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001092 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD; NEA/RA, INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  OIC SUMMIT UAE INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE OIC SUMMIT IN DOHA RECEIVED PRIMARY AND </p><p>EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN THE LOCAL MEDIA.  NEWS REPORTING AND </p><p>EDITORIALS STRESSED THAT THE ISSUE OF PALESTINE SHOULD ALSO BE A </p><p>MAIN CONCERN OF THIS SUMMIT.  EDITORIALS CONDEMNED ARAB AND </p><p>MUSLIM ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE SITUATION IN PALESTINE.  AN "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE ARAB SUMMIT\'S RESPONSE </p><p>TO THE UAE INITIATIVE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON THE OIC SUMMIT IN DOHA, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT "AL-ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/05: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE OIC SUMMIT IN DOHA COMES RIGHT AFTER THE ARAB SUMMIT, </p><p>WHICH DID NOT ADD ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS THAT FACES THE </p><p>ARAB AND ISLAMIC WORLDS.  THE SUMMIT ALSO DID NOT DEAL PROPERLY </p><p>WITH THE ONLY INITIATIVE (THE UAE\'S INITIATIVE) THAT AIMS TO END </p><p>THE CRISIS WE ARE ALL FACING.  THIS INITIATIVE STATED CLEARLY THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF TAKING A UNIFIED AND COURAGEOUS STAND, FAR FROM ANY </p><p>CONTROVERSY, IN ORDER TO SAVE THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND LANDS FROM ANY </p><p>CONSPIRACIES THAT THREATEN ITS PRESENT AND FUTURE ... WILL THE </p><p>OIC SUMMIT REACH THE LEVEL OF CHALLENGES IT FACES, OR WILL IT </p><p>REMAIN LIKE ANY OTHER ARAB AND ISLAMIC SUMMIT?" </p><p> </p><p>3.  ASSERTING THE OIC SUMMIT\'S OBLIGATION TOWARDS THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>CAUSE, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/05: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE OIC SUMMIT IN DOHA SHOULD ALSO BE CONCERNED WITH THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAUSE SINCE IT IS AN ARAB AND ISLAMIC CAUSE.  THIS </p><p>SUMMIT SHOULD REALIZE THAT WHAT\'S HAPPENING ON THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>LANDS WITH NO ARABIC OR ISLAMIC REACTION WILL LEAD TO A CRISIS </p><p>WORSE THAN THAT WHICH OCCURRED IN 1948 ... THE ACTS OF SHARON\'S </p><p>CABINET TO KILL THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE AND PEOPLE HAVE REACHED A </p><p>VERY CRUCIAL LEVEL ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  DESCRIBING THE ROLE OF THE U.S. IN THE PALESTINIAN CRISIS, </p><p>DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/05: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN PALESTINE </p><p>SINCE IT IS THE COUNTRY THAT HAS THE AUTHORITY IN THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL.  WHENEVER THE WORLD COMMUNITY WAKES UP TO MAKE ISRAEL </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS DEEDS, THE U.S. THREATENS THIS WITH THE </p><p>WEAPON OF ITS VETO.  IT IS SHAMEFUL FOR THE U.S. TO ASK ISRAEL </p><p>ONLY FOR SELF-RESTRAINT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT ISRAELI VIOLENCE </p><p>AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON THE SITUATION IN PALESTINE, "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/04: </p><p> </p><p>"... HOW DO WE EXPECT ISRAEL TO CHANGE THE BLOODY POLICY SEEING </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL REACTION TOWARDS ITS KILLING OF UNARMED </p><p>PALESTINIANS AS MERE STATEMENTS OF CONDEMNATIONS FROM POWERLESS </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NO REAL EFFECT ON THE ISRAELI POLICY.  SINCE </p><p>ISRAEL HAS THE APPROVAL AND FULL SUPPORT OF THE U.S. FOR KILLING </p><p>PALESTINIAN CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND ELDERS WITH \'M-16\'S PROVIDED BY </p><p>THE U.S., ISRAEL DOES NOT CARE AND HAS NO RED LINES TO INVADE THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP AND MUSLIM HOLY SITES IN OCCUPIED </p><p>JERUSALEM... IT IS NOT ONLY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY, BUT ALSO THAT OF THE ARABS..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  NOTING INCREASING SUPPORT FOR SHEIKH ZAYED\'S INITIATIVE IN </p><p>THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, "AL-ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/04: </p><p> </p><p>"... WITH THE INCREASED VOICES REQUESTING A THOROUGH REVISION OF </p><p>THE TECHNIQUES ADOPTED AT ARAB SUMMITS, WHICH USUALLY ONLY LEAD </p><p>TO FURTHER DIFFERENCES ... IN THE LATEST SUMMIT, THE UAE </p><p>INITIATIVE IS THE ONLY HOPE LEFT FOR ARABS TO DEAL WITH THEIR </p><p>PROBLEMS IN AN OBJECTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE WAY, FAR FROM THE </p><p>TYPICAL COURTEOUS BEHAVIOR FOR WHICH THE ARAB PEOPLE HAVE BEEN </p><p>PAYING A DEAR PRICE ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE,"  ENGLISH-DAILY, </p><p>DUBAI-BASED GULF NEWS EDITORIALIZED ON 03/05: </p><p> </p><p>"IRAQ IS DELIBERATELY TRYING THE PATIENCE OF THE HAWKS IN THE </p><p>AMERICAN AND BRITISH ADMINISTRATIONS, WHICH IS A DANGEROUS THING </p><p>TO DO AT SUCH AS SENSITIVE TIME.  THE MAJORITY OF WORLD OPINION </p><p>IS SIDED WITH THE IRAQI PEOPLE, WAR IS NOT A PLEASANT THING TO </p><p>CONTEMPLATE AND MERELY ILLUSTRATES THE INABILITY OF THE SO-CALLED </p><p>CIVILIZED SOCIETY TO RESOLVE THEIR DISPUTES ...  IT SEEMS HISTORY </p><p>TEACHES US NOTHING ...  THE ARGUMENT FOR GOING TO WAR HAS NOT </p><p>BEEN MADE:  THE PUBLIC REMAINS UNCONVINCED.  ALTERNATIVE </p><p>SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED, THEY SHOULD BE EXAMINED FIRST, </p><p>BEFORE ANY RUSH TO WAR." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
