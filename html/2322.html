<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 003228 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/19/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NEW ELECTORAL LAW SPARKS CONTROVERSY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: President Obasanjo signed the controversial </p><p>electoral law on December 6.   By shifting local government </p><p>elections from 2002 to 2003, the measure has pitted the </p><p>National Assembly against the state governors in a struggle </p><p>to gain influence over local governments and electoral </p><p>politics in general.  By signing the legislation, President </p><p>Obasanjo allied with the Assembly against the governors who </p><p>publicly have dared to challenge the President on resource </p><p>allocation and revenue-sharing issues.  At Obasanjo\'s </p><p>insistence, the law was amended to restrict the participation </p><p>of new political parties in the 2003 electoral season solely </p><p>to local government contests.  The bill also expanded INEC\'s </p><p>powers regarding the qualification of new parties and </p><p>candidates.  While given the breath of life in the </p><p>President\'s office, the new law seems destined to spend much </p><p>of its infancy in court.  State Governors will likely </p><p>challenge the Assembly\'s authority to stretch the tenure of </p><p>local governments.  Meanwhile, human </p><p> rights activists and out-of-favor politicians also have </p><p>questioned the constitutionality of its restrictive aspects. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  President Obasanjo signed the hotly debated electoral </p><p>law only a few days after receiving the measure.  The law had </p><p>been in joint committee for several weeks as Senate and House </p><p>conferees reconciled differences in their respective </p><p>versions.  While both versions delayed local government </p><p>elections from 2002 to 2003, their most salient difference </p><p>was that the Senate wanted a staggered 2003 election schedule </p><p>while the House preferred that all elections take place the </p><p>same day.  The final product incorporated the Senate </p><p>preference.  Other key provisions of the new electoral </p><p>measure are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The sequencing of elections in three stages: National, </p><p>State and Local; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The restriction of new political parties to participation </p><p>only in local elections for the 2003 electoral cycle; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Designation of the INEC as the final authority to </p><p>determine the qualification of parties and candidates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Most electoral experts agree that changing the local </p><p>elections to 2003 made sense on two counts. First, </p><p>preparations to hold local elections in early 2002 were </p><p>negligible. Time was swiftly running out to adequately </p><p>prepare for the elections.  Second, contemporaneous or </p><p>simultaneous elections were more efficient technically and </p><p>much more economical than the original schedule which </p><p>bifurcated the local races from the other elections. </p><p>However, passage of the new law was not driven by the advice </p><p>of these experts.  Their advice simply provided a rationale </p><p>for what the National Assembly might have done anyway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Delaying local elections a year basically was a child </p><p>of power politics disguised as a  technical fix.  Elected </p><p>officials in Abuja, from the National Assembly to the </p><p>Presidency (hereinafter referred to as "the Abuja Group"), </p><p>have grown wary of the power and independence exhibited by </p><p>state governors.  Given the governor\'s control over state and </p><p>local purse strings, the Abuja Group feared that local </p><p>elections in 2002 would give the governors undue political </p><p>advantage.  They worried a governor would use his position as </p><p>the state Chief Executive to funnel patronage at the local </p><p>level and thus control the outcome of local contests.  By </p><p>controlling the local electoral apparatus, the governors </p><p>would not only safeguard their incumbency, but would enhance </p><p>their influence over subsequent party Presidential and </p><p>National Assembly nominations as well as the 2003 general </p><p>elections for these offices.  In short, the Abuja group </p><p>feared the governors would become independent king-makers, </p><p>not beholden to the center or </p><p>the President. Any national office contestant seeking votes </p><p>in a particular state would be compelled to pay homage and </p><p>perhaps something more pecuniary to enlist the governor\'s </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) During a December 5 conversation with PolCouns, </p><p>Representative Suleiman Isiyaku (PDP-Yobe) acknowledged that </p><p>the primary motivation behind the law was to undercut the </p><p>governors\' growing power.  On issues such as resource </p><p>allocation and revenue sharing between the Federal Government </p><p>and the states, governors had become too demanding and </p><p>vociferous, he maintained.  While the governors caviled that </p><p>the Federal Government was not passing sufficient revenues to </p><p>them, too many governors were behaving dictatorially toward </p><p>local governments.  The very heavy-handedness they decried in </p><p>the Federal Government, many governors were applying to local </p><p>governments with even greater conviction and force. Not only </p><p>were many governors tightly controlling local government </p><p>expenditures to ensure their cronies handsome dollops from </p><p>the bursary, numerous governors also were unilaterally firing </p><p>elected local officials, contravening both state and federal </p><p>constitutions, Isiyaku stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to the Representative, the governors\' most </p><p>unforgivable infraction was to pressure members of the </p><p>National Assembly.  Many Assembly members, he declared, had </p><p>been threatened by governor\'s to hew the voting line </p><p>prescribed by governors on certain issues or risk the loss of </p><p>support at the local government level come legislative </p><p>elections.  The electoral law was passed in large measure to </p><p>stem the state executive\'s ability to control the political </p><p>and electoral apparatus at the local level, and thus wield </p><p>this sword in the face of Assembly members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Although governors would not dare lean on the </p><p>President as they had Assembly members, the Presidency was </p><p>aware of these machinations, Isiyaku asserted.  Aso Rock </p><p>realized the governors would eventually seek leverage over </p><p>the President.  The Villa wanted to avoid the situation where </p><p>carrying the Presidential sweepstakes in a particular state </p><p>would depend on the candidate being in the governor\'s good </p><p>graces.  The Presidency wanted the opposite dynamic, where </p><p>gubernatorial candidates needed the President\'s blessing. </p><p>The first step toward this objective was pushing the local </p><p>elections to 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The corollary was sequencing the 2003 elections so </p><p>that the national elections (Presidential and National </p><p>Assembly) preceded the state and local contests.  This </p><p>scenario complicates the governor\'s quest to wrest control of </p><p>the local areas before the Presidential elections.  Under the </p><p>new law, local incumbents will remain insulated until their </p><p>elections, which fall after to the national contests. </p><p>Additionally, the new sequencing compels a degree of </p><p>bottom-up party loyalty.  Given the bandwagon effect in </p><p>Nigeria, the party winning the Presidency will likely win </p><p>most state and local races.  To buoy their chances of </p><p>victory, state and local aspirants now will find it in their </p><p>interests to ensure the success of their party\'s Presidential </p><p>nominee.  (Comment: The amended electoral schedule represents </p><p>the convergent interests of nationally elected officials in </p><p>minimizing the political power of state executives, and </p><p>secondarily, of state legislatures.  The local government </p><p>incumbents, whose tenure has been ex </p><p>tended by a year, also aligned themselves with the national </p><p>elected officials.  One national representative admitted that </p><p>officials of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria </p><p>(ALGON) had visited the Capitol in Abuja, doling out </p><p>contributions to ensure Assembly Members passed the electoral </p><p>measures. End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The law\'s passage will not mute the governors and </p><p>state assemblies.  While the measure was still working its </p><p>way through the National Assembly, Governors and State </p><p>Assemblies launched an aggressive, often confrontational </p><p>public relations blitz to discourage the law\'s passage.  The </p><p>Governors trashed the measure as an usurpation of power, </p><p>arguing the constitution conferred the authority to extend </p><p>local government tenures to state governments not to the </p><p>National Assembly.  State assemblies threatened </p><p>constitutional standoffs by vowing to dissolve Local </p><p>Government Councils and hold elections in 2002, </p><p>notwithstanding the bill.  (Comment:  The Governor\'s exegesis </p><p>is not unreasonable. The constitution gives State Assemblies </p><p>authority over the establishment of local governments, while </p><p>it provides the National Assembly general authority to </p><p>establish electoral laws.  The document does not explicitly </p><p>grant to any arm of government the power to extend local </p><p>government tenures. Both sides argue the constitution sho </p><p>uld be read in way that gives them the power. Many prominent </p><p>legal minds believe the constitutional interpretation </p><p>emanating from the State Assemblies -- that the </p><p>"establishment clause" gives the power to the states -- is </p><p>more compelling than the arguments being mustered in Abuja. </p><p>End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) After the bill was passed, Obasanjo huddled selected </p><p>Governors and National Assembly leaders together in an </p><p>apparent effort to forge a compromise.  However, there was no </p><p>visible exit from the legal and political tangle the </p><p>collective public hectoring and posturing had wrought.  The </p><p>Governors had offered not to object to the bill and the 2003 </p><p>local elections if the federal government would allow the </p><p>dissolution of the Local Government Councils in 2002.  The </p><p>governors would then hand pick the interim local officials. </p><p>At that point, the Governors\' arguments for constitutional </p><p>propriety rang hollow, Isikayu declared.  By requesting the </p><p>power to unilaterally fill elected positions, the Governors\' </p><p>solution would cause more wreckage than the flaw it sought to </p><p>repair, he claimed. Rejecting the proposal as an unwise </p><p>augmentation in gubernatorial power, the Assembly passed the </p><p>bill, sending it to the President for signing on December 3. </p><p>By December 6, Obasanjo signed the measure, stating that </p><p>whomever felt ag </p><p>grieved should take the matter to court. Governors are </p><p>scheduled to meet December 19 to discuss a collective course </p><p>of action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>New Parties Put on a Short, Local Leash </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In addition to shifting the local elections, the law </p><p>restricts newly registered parties to participation solely in </p><p>local elections.  Only those new parties that win at least 15 </p><p>percent of local government chairmanships in two thirds of </p><p>the states in 2003 will be allowed to contest in national and </p><p>state elections come 2007.  The ostensible reason for this </p><p>provision is to ensure stability by limiting the propagation </p><p>of small, parochial groups that would only exacerbate ethnic </p><p>and regional tensions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Critics upbraid the provision as undermining the </p><p>freedom of association.  Limiting the new parties to local </p><p>government elections, which are now the caboose of the </p><p>electoral train, discourages formation of new parties. </p><p>People eyeing national or state office would be penalized by </p><p>joining a new organization; now, these office-seekers must </p><p>affiliate with an existing group. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Most observers see the measure as Obasanjo\'s attempt </p><p>to fence in PDP members and power-brokers who have become </p><p>disenchanted with his Administration.  Rumors abound about </p><p>Northern heavyweights, including former Head of State </p><p>Babangida, being seized with displeasure over Obasanjo\'s </p><p>failure to consult them regularly and his perceived tilt </p><p>toward his Southwest homeland.  Some Governors and National </p><p>Assembly members also dislike Obasanjo.  This restrictive </p><p>provision will prevent this corps of disgruntled politicos </p><p>from bucking the PDP to form parties that could influence </p><p>national and state election outcomes.  By limiting the field </p><p>to extant parties, the new legislation benefits the ruling </p><p>PDP and, by extension, President Obasanjo should he seek a </p><p>second term.  The argument that this change was made to </p><p>prevent defections from the PDP is bolstered by the fact that </p><p>it came at the Presidency\'s behest.  Apparently, the clause </p><p>was inserted at the thirteenth hour, after the law had </p><p>already been adopted by both ho </p><p>uses. This inclusion would appear to be a procedural </p><p>irregularity. However, since the bill suited their interests, </p><p>few in the Assembly seem to mind this procedural blemish. The </p><p>law may also keep centrifugal forces within the opposition </p><p>APP and AD in check.  Riven by internal factionalism, they </p><p>stand a better chance of survival if potential defectors face </p><p>political irrelevance as a price for leaving.  However, </p><p>opposition leaders also realize the new measure might drive </p><p>defectors into the governing PDP instead of the new parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>INEC\'s Influence Rises </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  The electoral law significantly expands INEC </p><p>authority to disqualify candidates and parties.  Previously, </p><p>INEC was delegated the authority to render administrative </p><p>determinations about a party\'s or candidate\'s eligibility. </p><p>Disputes would go to the courts.  The new law ejects the </p><p>courts from its normal jurisdiction to hear these disputes. </p><p>INEC will be the final arbiter.  Although the courts are not </p><p>immune to political pressure, opponents of this provision </p><p>consider INEC as more susceptible than the judiciary to </p><p>bending to the Executive\'s will.  These opponents fear Aso </p><p>Rock will influence INEC\'s determination, which, as the law </p><p>now stands, are not subject to review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>The Disaffected and Dismayed </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) While signatories to the law are congratulating </p><p>themselves for protecting their incumbencies, opponents are </p><p>huddling together to blunt the effect of the legislation. </p><p>The opponents make an incongruous army: Officials of the </p><p>Yoruba-based AD, leaders of prospective political parties, </p><p>state Governors, legislators and a coterie of the nation\'s </p><p>best know human rights attorneys and activists have been the </p><p>most vocal critics.  The list of activists who oppose the </p><p>bill reads like a Who\'s Who of Human Rights in Nigeria: </p><p>Constitutional Rights Project leader Clement Nwankwo, Civil </p><p>Liberties Organization founder Olisa Agbakoba, Beko </p><p>Ransome-Kuti, the irascible Femi Falana and the irrepressible </p><p>Gani Fawehinmi. Fawehinmi\'s distaste for the bill was such </p><p>that he resigned as an attorney for the House of </p><p>Representatives.  Attacking on several fronts, the human </p><p>rights activists believe the law is infirm because the </p><p>National Assembly overstepped constitutional bounds by </p><p>extending the tenure of local governments.  Secon </p><p>d, they join in lambasting the restrictions on new parties as </p><p>anti-democratic.  Third, the designation of the INEC as the </p><p>final arbiter of electoral qualifications is considered both </p><p>an improper usurpation of the judiciary\'s constitutional </p><p>mandate and a thinly veiled device to enable the Presidency </p><p>to exert significant influence over which parties and </p><p>candidates get the green light from the INEC.  In short, they </p><p>are convinced that the law\'s unconstitutional and restrictive </p><p>(undemocratic) bent far outweigh the logistical and economic </p><p>benefits of grouping the elections closer together. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) During the past six weeks, the electoral law has been </p><p>a genuine political tug of war. As with most issues that </p><p>reach this level of controversy, a politician\'s viewpoint is </p><p>shaped more by self-interest than principle.  Those who stand </p><p>to gain, ignore the law\'s possible shortcomings; those who </p><p>are undercut by the law\'s passage, see only warts. Yet, the </p><p>controversy reveals a dynamic made possible by the new </p><p>democratic dispensation in Nigeria.  Usually, the political </p><p>fault lines are drawn by ethnicity, region or religion -- by </p><p>those immutable characteristics that define "who you are." </p><p>This time, battlements are delineated more by "what office </p><p>you fill." Governors, regardless of region, state size, and </p><p>ethnicity hold a unified view.  Likewise, National Assembly </p><p>members see things similarly despite their many differences </p><p>and despite acrimony over previous issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 17. (C) In some ways, it is a positive development to see </p><p>the debate fashioned by the actor\'s position in the political </p><p>constellation and not by intrinsic factors that are more or </p><p>less unchangeable. In a certain sense, the emergence of new </p><p>political alliances that cut across traditional ethnic and </p><p>regional lines is a sign of democratization. The downside is </p><p>that this competition over the electoral law primarily </p><p>represents the continuation of power politics by other means. </p><p>The alliances are based almost solely on self-interested </p><p>electoral considerations. Now, they have allied to protect </p><p>their positions.  The competition also leaves the </p><p>psychological impression that the law generally pits the </p><p>"ins" against the "outs," often a source of disequilibrium </p><p>when a nation embraces a new political system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Using this legal device to gain higher ground in an </p><p>essentially political battle may produce some unintended </p><p>casualties.  The overt infighting within the political class </p><p>affirms the public\'s perception that Nigerian politicians </p><p>cannot effectively govern their own appetites, let alone </p><p>govern the nation.  Some of the law\'s provisions also seem to </p><p>challenge the sanctity of the constitution.  Everyone praises </p><p>the constitution; yet, in the next breath, many are ready to </p><p>jettison one of the document\'s provisions if the excision </p><p>suits their immediate interests.   The manner in which the </p><p>measure was passed did not advance the rule of law and may </p><p>have weakened it, to a degree. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) The brouhaha will likely be cast to the judiciary, </p><p>giving the Supreme Court a chance to affirm its position as </p><p>final arbiter of constitutional issues. If called upon, the </p><p>judiciary will need to exert its independence by impartially </p><p>deciding the Act\'s constitutionality.  If so, the Court would </p><p>have taken a key step in what promises to be the lengthy </p><p>journey of defining the parameters in which the political </p><p>game can be played responsibly in Nigeria.  The Court\'s </p><p>decision could seminally influence the contours of Nigerian </p><p>federalism as much as John Marshall\'s decisions shaped </p><p>American federalism during the early years of our Republic. </p><p>Still, the larger question looms: does the law increase the </p><p>prospects for  the elections of 2003 to be superior to those </p><p>of 1999?  While too early to venture a guess, the measure </p><p>establishes salient observations points from which we can </p><p>gauge the process as events unfold.  For example, the </p><p>independence and impartiality of the INEC loom more </p><p>importantly in view of the INEC\' </p><p>s increased power to determine who can enter the electoral </p><p>fray.  Also, in that few political parties will be allowed to </p><p>contest in national elections, intra-party mechanisms to </p><p>ensure participation and access will weigh heavily.  Last, by </p><p>signing the law, Obasanjo tacitly indicated he is considering </p><p>a second term and is positioning himself accordingly. In the </p><p>short term, the law strengthens Obasanjo. However the more </p><p>people see Obasanjo as a candidate and because of the </p><p>restrictive aspects of the law, the more important it will be </p><p>for him to act in a manner showing Executive branch </p><p>commitment to honest elections. If he does not act to soothe </p><p>ruffled feathers and co-opt some of the law\'s critics, then </p><p>opposition to the law might intensify and that would wound </p><p>Obasanjo in the longer term. </p><p>20  ( C) In the end, electoral considerations make for </p><p>strange bedfellows. A year ago, the relationship between the </p><p>President and the National Assembly was rancorous. Now, they </p><p>have allied to help protect each other\'s electoral chances. </p><p>This might reflect a one- time meeting of the minds or it </p><p>could represent a deeper recognition between the Presidency </p><p>and the Assembly of the need to cooperate, to the extent </p><p>possible, during the pre-election period. How the Assembly </p><p>treats the budget debates when it reconvenes early next year </p><p>will be a major indication of which description is more apt. </p><p>End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
