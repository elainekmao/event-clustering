<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001763 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, INL, DS/ATA AND S/CT </p><p>FBI FOR FBIHQ/ITAU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/13/08 </p><p>TAGS: PTER,PREL,PARM,PGOV,PBTS,ETTC,EAIR,ELTN,TC </p><p>SUBJECT: CT TRAINING STRATEGY FOR UAEG: STRATEGIC </p><p>DIALOGUE FOLLOW-UP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 16509       B) STATE 71265 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) As a "next steps" follow-up to the U.S.-UAE </p><p>Strategic Dialogue (see ref A), we have met with UAEG </p><p>officials and identified UAE law enforcement training </p><p>needs in counter-terrorism cooperation.  Training </p><p>needs include courses directly addressing counter- </p><p>terrorism as well as basic law enforcement training to </p><p>enhance the UAE\'s ability to combat terrorism and </p><p>cooperate with us in the Global War On Terrorism </p><p>(GWOT) and the fight against other transnational </p><p>crimes.  We note that enhanced UAEG counter-terrorism </p><p>capability continues to be a strong U.S. national </p><p>security interest in that it serves and promotes the </p><p>U.S.-led GWOT.  The UAEG has been a pro-active partner </p><p>in GWOT.  Facilitating CT training for the UAE is a </p><p>matter of utmost importance to the bilateral </p><p>relationship.  We request the Department\'s early </p><p>consideration of our proposed training strategy. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Training Needs </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) USG CT training for the UAEG to-date has been </p><p>well-received, and Post appreciates the offer of the </p><p>Terrorism Investigations Training Course (ATA-4173) </p><p>scheduled for 28 June - 23 July (see septel for Post\'s </p><p>formal response to offer). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Responding to the bilateral Strategic Dialogue </p><p>"next steps" regarding counter-terrorism cooperation </p><p>(ref A, pars. 13-14), the UAEG has prioritized </p><p>continuing CT training needs for law enforcement and, </p><p>concomitantly, we have identified CT training needs </p><p>for various UAE agencies. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Monitoring entry and egress at the UAE\'s many </p><p>airports, seaports and land border stations continues </p><p>to be the UAE\'s overriding law enforcement weakness. </p><p>A number of UAEG federal ministries and emirate-level </p><p>departments, including State Security, the Ministry of </p><p>Interior and its immigration department, as well as </p><p>emirate-level civil aviation, police and immigration </p><p>departments, are all involved in this effort.  The UAE </p><p>Armed Forces physically monitors the land borders, and </p><p>the UAE\'s long coastline is patrolled by the UAE Navy </p><p>and Coast Guard. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) To meet the UAEG\'s training needs in counter- </p><p>terrorism and to enhance its ability to cooperate with </p><p>us in matters of U.S. national security, we propose </p><p>four ATA training courses, three of which are directly </p><p>related to border security issues as well as Weapons </p><p>of Mass Destruction Phase 2 (Note: The WMD Phase 1 was </p><p>held January 2001. End note.). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) It is Post\'s opinion that the UAE law </p><p>enforcement community lacks some fundamental law </p><p>enforcement skills necessary for effective </p><p>investigations in counter-terrorism.  To increase the </p><p>efficacy of our previous and future CT training, it is </p><p>imperative that we supplement the currently existing </p><p>CT training with training in basic law enforcement. </p><p>This basic-skills training would greatly enhance the </p><p>UAE\'s ability to combat counter-terrorism and </p><p>cooperate with us in the GWOT and the fight against </p><p>other transnational crimes. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Proposed Training Strategy </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) We propose a 3-year training strategy to </p><p>accomplish the objectives of protecting U.S. national </p><p>security interests in fighting the GWOT and meeting </p><p>UAEG CT and basic law enforcement needs so that they </p><p>can ably help us achieve this end: </p><p> </p><p>2003 </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>ATA </p><p> </p><p>-- Terror Investigations (ATA-4173 -- Ref B) </p><p>-- Airport Security </p><p> </p><p>FBI </p><p>[Note: The following schedule has been coordinated </p><p>with FBIHQ/International Training and Assistance Unit </p><p>(ITAU), pending INL approval and funding, i.e., travel </p><p>and per diem.
