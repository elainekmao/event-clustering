SUMMARY:  EMBASSY VATICAN HOSTED A ONE-DAY SEMINAR ON </p><p>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD JANUARY 27 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00504  01 OF 02  071112Z </p><p>AIMED AT OFFERING AFRICAN PERSPECTIVES ON BIOTECH </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS TO KEY HOLY SEE OFFICIALS, NGO REPRESENTATIVES, </p><p>AND DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES ACCREDITED TO THE HOLY SEE </p><p>FROM MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  THE PANELISTS -- INCLUDING </p><p>FARMERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ACTIVISTS AND SCIENTISTS -- </p><p>MADE CLEAR THEIR BELIEF THAT AFRICA NEEDS TO AVAIL ITSELF OF </p><p>BIOTECH CROPS IN ORDER TO SECURE A HEALTHY AND PROSPEROUS </p><p>FUTURE FOR ITS PEOPLE.  IN THE FACE OF PERSISTENT SUSPICION </p><p>OF ECONOMIC MOTIVES BEHIND U.S. PROMOTION OF BIOTECH FOODS, </p><p>THE COMPELLING MESSAGE ARTICULATED BY THE AFRICAN PANELISTS </p><p>LEFT PARTICIPANTS WITH A CLEAR SENSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR </p><p>BIOTECH FOODS NOT ONLY TO RELIEVE THE CURRENT FAMINE, BUT </p><p>ALSO TO CONTRIBUTE TO MORE EFFICIENT, SELF-SUSTAINING </p><p>AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>ECONOMIC BENEFITS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   CONTINUING EMBASSY VATICAN\'S ADVOCACY FOR BIOTECH FOODS </p><p>WITH THE HOLY SEE AND AFFILIATED AGENCIES (REFTEL), MISSION </p><p>HOSTED A CONFERENCE IN COORDINATION WITH AFRICABIO AND THE </p><p>ITALIAN ASSOCIATION OF BIOTECH COMPANIES AIMED AT BROADENING </p><p>OUR DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE BEYOND IMMEDIATE FAMINE RELIEF </p><p>TO LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF BIOTECH CROPS. </p><p>CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT THE ECONOMIC </p><p>BENEFITS BIOTECH CAN OFFER AFRICA, ASIA AND OTHER DEVELOPING </p><p>AREAS.  ONE SOUTH AFRICAN FARMER AND BIOTECH PIONEER </p><p>(BUTHELIZI) TOLD HIS STORY OF OVERCOMING SKEPTICISM TOWARD </p><p>BIOTECH CROPS THROUGH HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE MORE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00504  01 OF 02  071112Z </p><p>PROFITABLE SEED.  WHEN FIRST OFFERED BIOTECH SEED, HE DECIDED </p><p>TO SPLIT HIS CROP 50-50 BETWEEN BIOTECH AND TRADITIONAL </p><p>MAIZE.  THAT FIRST YEAR, HIS REGION EXPERIENCED HEAVY RAINS </p><p>AND FLOODING WHICH PROVED DISASTROUS FOR HIS TRADITIONAL </p><p>CROPS (EATEN BY PESTS) BUT HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON HIS </p><p>PEST-RESISTANT BIOTECH CROP.  BUTHELIZI AND MOST OF HIS </p><p>NEIGHBORS NOW UTILIZE BIOTECH CROPS, AS THEY PREFER THE </p><p>RELIABLE PRODUCTION AND ABILITY TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. </p><p>RESPONDING TO ONE OF THE FREQUENT ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD </p><p>AGAINST BIOTECH SEEDS, BUTHELIZI SAID IT WAS WORTH THE </p><p>INITIAL HIGHER COSTS TO PURCHASE BIOTECH SEED BECAUSE THE </p><p>BIOTECH PLANTS REQUIRED LESS MANUAL LABOR, FERTILIZER, AND </p><p>PESTICIDES, WHILE PROVIDING HIGHER YIELD CROPS.  AN INDIAN </p><p>COTTON FARMER, JAYAPAL REDDY, ECHOED BUTHELIZI\'S COMMENTS, </p><p>AND INSISTED THAT PEOPLE IN THE WEST SHOULD "LET THE WISDOM </p><p>OF INDIAN FARMERS DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO USE BIOTECH." </p><p> </p><p>3.  BINTONY KUTSAIRA, A MEMBER OF MALAWI\'S PARLIAMENT, </p><p>OUTLINED THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS BIOTECH CROPS WOULD HAVE </p><p>FOR AFRICA.  HE POINTED OUT THAT 80 PERCENT OF AFRICA\'S </p><p>POPULATION IS ENGAGED IN FARMING, BUT CANNOT MANAGE TO </p><p>PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED ITS PEOPLE, WHEREAS, LESS THAN 10 </p><p>PERCENT OF EUROPE\'S POPULATION IS ENGAGED IN FARMING YET </p><p>PRODUCES ENOUGH TO MEET ITS OWN DIETARY NEEDS AND EXPORT ON A </p><p>COMMERCIAL SCALE (IN THE U.S. THE FIGURE IS LESS THAN 1 </p><p>PERCENT).  KUTSAIRA BLAMED AFRICA\'S CHRONIC UNDERDEVELOPMENT </p><p>IN PART ON THIS LACK OF EFFICIENCY IN THE AGRICULTURAL </p><p>SECTOR.  AS LONG AS SO MANY OF AFRICA\'S PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON </p><p>SUBSISTENCE FARMS, EKING OUT A BASIC LIVING FROM ONE CRISIS </p><p>TO ANOTHER, HE CONCLUDED, AFRICA WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO </p><p>ADVANCE ECONOMICALLY. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00504  01 OF 02  071112Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  REFLECTING THE PERVERSE MENTALITY OF "SUPPORT" FROM SOME </p><p>IN THE WEST, ONE JESUIT CURIA REPRESENTATIVE SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>INCREASED AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY FROM BIOTECH CROPS WOULD </p><p>LEAD TO GREATER UNEMPLOYMENT IN AFRICA BY DISPLACING WORKERS </p><p>FROM THE FARMS.  PROFESSOR DIRAN MAKINDE FROM THE UNIVERSITY </p><p>OF VENDA IN SOUTH AFRICA, COUNTERED THAT THE LACK OF </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY WAS LEADING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO DESERT THE </p><p>FARMS FOR CITIES ANYWAY, DESPITE LIMITED PROSPECTS.  GREATER </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY, HE NOTED, WOULD EVENTUALLY ALLOW MORE SKILLED </p><p>WORKERS TO MOVE "FROM THE FIELD INTO THE FACTORY" TO PRODUCE </p><p>GOODS WITH A HIGHER ADDED VALUE.  PROFESSOR MAKINDE </p><p>UNDERSCORED HIS FRUSTRATION WITH ARGUMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY </p><p>SAID AFRICA SHOULD REMAIN TRAPPED IN A CHRONIC UNDERDEVELOPED </p><p>STATE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>HEALTH BENEFITS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  PANEL MEMBERS ALSO EMPHASIZED POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS </p><p>THAT BIOTECH CROPS WOULD BRING TO AFRICA, NOTING THAT BIOTECH </p><p>FOODS COULD HELP SECURE A CONSISTENT, NUTRITIONAL DIET TO </p><p>HELP IN THE STRUGGLES AGAINST AIDS, MALARIA AND TUBERCULOSIS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4683 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00504  02 OF 02  071113Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EXME-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  ECA-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------3291BC  071113Z /38 </p><p>R 071029Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 000504 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

HE STRESSED THAT BIOTECH CROPS NEEDED TO </p><p>BE UTILIZED NOW BY AFRICA IN ORDER TO MEET THE DIETARY NEEDS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00504  02 OF 02  071113Z </p><p>OF AFRICANS.  THE FARMER,BUTHELIZI, EXPLAINED HOW BIOTECH </p><p>CROPS HAVE LED HIM TO USE FEWER PESTICIDES, SO THAT HE AND </p><p>HIS EMPLOYEES -- AS WELL AS CONSUMERS -- BENEFIT FROM LESS </p><p>EXPOSURE TO THE CHEMICALS.  PROFESSOR MAKINDE CONCLUDED THAT </p><p>AFRICA COULD NOT AFFORD TO MISS OUT ON BIOTECH AS IT HAD </p><p>MISSED THE FIRST \'GREEN REVOLUTION.\' </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>GETTING FACTS STRAIGHT ON BIOTECH </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  ALL PANEL MEMBERS AGREED THAT AFRICA AND THE WEST HAVE TO </p><p>GET THEIR FACTS STRAIGHT ON BIOTECH.  MP KUTSAIRA OBSERVED </p><p>THAT AFRICANS NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT FOOD AID IS </p><p>NOT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION; SELF-SUFFICIENCY IS.  PROFESSOR </p><p>L.E. MUMBA OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ZAMBIA, SAID THAT AFRICA HAS </p><p>TO DEVELOP ITS CAPACITY IN BIOTECH RESEARCH, BIOTECH </p><p>MARKETING, AND IN PREDICTING AND ADAPTING TO WEATHER BEFORE </p><p>IT CAN BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT.  PROFESSOR JAMES OCHANDA OF </p><p>THE UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>CLARIFYING THE INFORMATION ABOUT BIOTECH FOODS CIRCULATING IN </p><p>AFRICA, ADDING THAT TOO MUCH MISINFORMATION IS BEING SPREAD, </p><p>WHICH IS GENERATING SIGNIFICANT CONFUSION.  PROFESSOR JOCELYN </p><p>WEBSTER, A SOUTH AFRICAN AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AFRICABIO, </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS AND AGRICULTURAL </p><p>LOBBIES HAVE BEEN INFLUENCING AFRICANS FOR YEARS WITH </p><p>INCOMPLETE OR FALSE INFORMATION.  SHE RELATED A PERSONAL </p><p>EXPERIENCE TRYING TO SELL SOUTH AFRICAN BT FEEDCORN TO A </p><p>NAMIBIAN CATTLE OPERATION.  THE NAMIBIANS REFUSED IT BECAUSE </p><p>THEIR EUROPEAN END-USERS HAD SAID THEY WOULD NOT RISK </p><p>IMPORTING BT-FED BEEF GIVEN THE CURRENT ANTI-BIOTECH CLIMATE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00504  02 OF 02  071113Z </p><p>IN EUROPE.  RESPONDING TO THE OFT HEARD ARGUMENT THAT THERE </p><p>WAS NO NEED FOR BIOTECH FOODS BECAUSE THERE IS ENOUGH FOOD IN </p><p>THE WORLD ALREADY, PROFESSOR OCHANDA SAID THAT THE WORLD </p><p>NEEDED TO ACCEPT THAT THE REDISTRIBUTION OF FOOD WAS NOT </p><p>WORKING.  MOST FOOD IS CONSUMED WHERE IT IS GROWN AND </p><p>REDISTRIBUTION IS MORE OF A BAND-AID THAN A SOLUTION FOR THE </p><p>RECURRING CRISES IN AFRICA.  HE LIKENED BIOTECH TO THE KEY </p><p>THAT WOULD FREE AFRICA FROM THE RECURRING CYCLES OF FEAST OR </p><p>FAMINE.  BUTHELIZI SAID THAT THE WORLD, EUROPE IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>NEEDED TO LET AFRICANS USE THEIR OWN JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE </p><p>HOW BEST "TO FEED OUR PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS AFTER THE CONFERENCE, HOLY SEE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS APPEARED TO BE OPEN TO THE AFRICANS\' ARGUMENTS </p><p>AND WELCOMED THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR "THE OTHER SIDE OF THE </p><p>STORY."  WE NOTE THAT BOTH THE JESUITS -- WHO HAVE BEEN THE </p><p>SOURCE OF CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS IN ZAMBIA -- AND CARITAS </p><p>EUROPE HAVE PUBLISHED POSITION PAPERS OPPOSED TO </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY IN AFRICA.  THIS MEETING EXPOSED THEIR HEAD </p><p>OFFICES TO THE "GOOD NEWS" ON AG-BIOTECH AND ITS POTENTIAL TO </p><p>HELP COMMUNITIES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, AND HOPEFULLY WILL </p><p>FOSTER A REASSESSMENT THAT COULD EVENTUALLY MAKE ITS WAY TO </p><p>THE FIELD.  THE MESSAGE THEY HEARD FROM THE AFRICANS AND </p><p>ASIANS WAS CONSISTENT AND CLEAR:  THEY WANT DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHAT IS IN THEIR OWN BEST </p><p>INTEREST AND THEY WANT AN END TO DESTRUCTIVE OUTSIDE </p><p>INFLUENCES. THEY ALSO MADE A STRONG BID FOR MORE ASSISTANCE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00504  02 OF 02  071113Z </p><p>IN DEVELOPING THEIR CAPACITY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. </p><p>WITH 90 PERCENT OF AFRICAN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS DESTINED FOR </p><p>EUROPE, A RECURRING THEME WAS FOR EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TO </p><p>STOP BLOCKING BIOTECH ADVANCEMENTS BY KEEPING THEIR MARKETS </p><p>CLOSED TO BIOTECH PRODUCTS.  TO THE AFRICAN PANELISTS, </p><p>EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS ARE SEEN AS PREVENTING ECONOMIC </p><p>ADVANCEMENT IN AFRICA BY THREATENING TO KEEP AFRICAN BIOTECH </p><p>PRODUCTS OUT OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA00504 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
