Gul said that it </p><p>would not be in the U.S. interest to provoke anti- </p><p>American sentiment in an ally like Turkey.  He added </p><p>that Turkey would keep its troops in Northern Iraq </p><p>until security conditions improve.  U.S. Ambassador </p><p>Robert Pearson told the semi-official Anatolian Press </p><p>agency that preliminary information had been given to </p><p>the Turkish side regarding the detentions in </p><p>Suleymaniye.  Pearson added that any dialogue with the </p><p>PKK/KADEK would take place in coordination with the </p><p>Turkish government.  EUCOM General James Jones arrived </p><p>in Ankara on Tuesday to defuse tensions between the two </p><p>NATO allies.  During his call on the TGS, General Jones </p><p>was given the message that Turkish troops in Northern </p><p>Iraq would retaliate to new attacks.  The TGS told the </p><p>American side that Turkish troops had the right to stay </p><p>in Northern Iraq in order to eliminate threats from </p><p>terrorist groups based in the region.  General Jones </p><p>and the Turks agreed to discuss the matter in Ankara on </p><p>Wednesday at a joint commission with officials from </p><p>both sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hurriyet" says the U.S. Administration has no </p><p>intention to apologize over the Suleymaniye incident. </p><p>U.S. officials are complaining about unacceptable </p><p>activities by Turkish troops in Northern Iraq, and </p><p>demanding the withdrawal of soldiers from the region. </p><p>Papers believe that the GOT, alarmed by the incident in </p><p>Northern Iraq and the Armenian genocide bill, will </p><p>review Turkey\'s strategic cooperation with the U.S. at </p><p>the National Security Council (NSC) meeting later this </p><p>month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Armenian genocide draft: Dailies believe that the </p><p>Armenian genocide bill submitted to the Senate for </p><p>approval could contribute to a further souring of ties </p><p>between the U.S. and Turkey.  Vice President Cheney has </p><p>been working to ensure a rejection of the bill. </p><p>Justice Minister and government spokesman Cemil Cicek </p><p>reportedly said that the genocide issue was an </p><p>opportunity for the U.S. to repair the strain in its </p><p>ties with Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Israeli President in Turkey: Visiting Israeli President </p><p>Katzav said after meeting with his Turkish counterpart </p><p>Sezer and Prime Minister Erdogan on Tuesday that Turkey </p><p>could mediate to help improve Israel\'s ties with the </p><p>Arabs.  Katzav also responded warmly to Erdogan\'s offer </p><p>to host a summit meeting between Israel and Palestine </p><p>in Turkey.  Katzav stressed the significance of the </p><p>U.S.-Israeli-Turkish strategic partnership for peace in </p><p>the region, and asked for Ankara\'s support against </p><p>Iranian nuclear programs targeting Israel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Turkish Relations/N. Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Strategic Tuning" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (7/9): "The </p><p>incident in northern Iraq is clearly the end of the </p><p>strategic partnership between the two countries.  The </p><p>detention of Turkish soldiers is like `putting the nail </p><p>in the coffin\' of the partnership.  The concept of </p><p>strategic partnership was created in the post-cold war </p><p>era and developed over the course of time.  However, </p><p>the Iraq crisis has put an end to this concept, which </p><p>actually means that the ties were never at the level of </p><p>a genuine partnership. . The Turkish military presence </p><p>in northern Iraq is designed to address three goals: </p><p>the elimination of the PKK/KADEK; the monitoring of </p><p>political and military activities of the Kurds; and </p><p>providing assistance to the Turkomen. . Rhetorically, </p><p>the US does not have a different position from Turkey\'s </p><p>in any of these three areas.  Yet in practice we see </p><p>some differences stemming from skepticism or mistrust. </p><p>These differences can be eliminated as long as Ankara </p><p>and Washington agree on the fundamental parameters. </p><p>Both countries are in need of strategic fine-tuning." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What the US is doing?" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in mass appeal-conservative Turkiye </p><p>(7/9): "It seems credible that the US is actually </p><p>trying to give a clear warning to Turkey in order to </p><p>get Ankara on its side in upcoming operations against </p><p>Iran and Syria.  The US wants Ankara to realize that </p><p>there is no room for neutrality in this game. </p><p>Washington has been issuing indirect or verbal </p><p>warnings, yet Ankara did not take them seriously to </p><p>this point.  In a possible operation against Iran, it </p><p>is very likely that the US will ask Turkey to join. </p><p>There is one more possibility which is also credible: </p><p>The US may be trying to eliminate the Turks in the area </p><p>and weaken the Turkomans and Arabs in order to pave the </p><p>way for an autonomy for its loyal allies Barzani and </p><p>Talabani. . The incident in northern Iraq is </p><p>unacceptable and incompatible with the spirit of the </p><p>NATO alliance.  This incident is only turning the US </p><p>into a loser.  The US captured Iraq very quickly, but </p><p>what comes next is unknown even to the US.  Such </p><p>policies will make it even harder for the US to retain </p><p>its hegemony in the region." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
