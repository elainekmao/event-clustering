<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000388 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL/CRA, DRL/PHD, and EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, ELAB, KDEM, KSEP, XG, VM, HUMANR, ETMIN, TIP </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM:  USG HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 13786 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Ambassador and other Embassy and Consulate General </p><p>officers demarched and spoke with GVN authorities at the </p><p>national, provincial, and local levels numerous times </p><p>throughout the year on various human rights issues including </p><p>religious freedom as well as the status of persons of </p><p>concern detained, imprisoned, harassed, or otherwise abused </p><p>by authorities.  Results include GVN issuance of passports </p><p>to over two dozen Montagnard families, allowing them to take </p><p>advantage of their eligibility for various U.S. refugee </p><p>programs.  Some had been waiting over three years for </p><p>passports.  A Chinese national who had entered Vietnam </p><p>illegally was allowed to depart under a US refugee program </p><p>and join his asylee parents in the U.S.  Other intervention </p><p>resulted in improved GVN treatment of some other persons of </p><p>concern, such as a prominent actor and a controversial Hoa </p><p>Hao monk. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy and Consulate General officers visited political </p><p>activists and leaders of non-government recognized religious </p><p>groups throughout the year, particularly following instances </p><p>of government harassment or as a pre-emptive measure after </p><p>others were harassed or detained.  These visits demonstrated </p><p>that the USG took their welfare seriously and in some cases </p><p>may have delayed or discouraged action against them. </p><p>Beneficiaries included activists Nguyen Dan Que and Nguyen </p><p>Thanh Giang, unregistered Buddhist church leader Thich Huyen </p><p>Quang, and two Mennonite Sunday school teachers.  ConGenoffs </p><p>demonstrated interest in the latter by circling the police </p><p>station where they were detained in the Consul General\'s </p><p>vehicle -- no flags flying, but with unmistakable diplomatic </p><p>plates.  Police released the teachers the next day. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy and Consulate General arranged the visits of </p><p>members of the U.S. Commission on International Religious </p><p>Freedom as well as the Ambassador-at-Large for Religious </p><p>Freedom, including formal meetings with a wide variety of </p><p>GVN officials as well as religious leaders.  The Embassy </p><p>also facilitated the visit to the U.S. of GVN religious </p><p>affairs officials and religious leaders. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy officers for the first time ever visited Vietnamese </p><p>prisons -- twice during the year -- to investigate prison </p><p>conditions and demonstrate US interest and concern. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy initiated a mid-level human rights channel with the </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs that provided an effective means </p><p>to raise concerns and obtain official information about </p><p>persons of concern, including activist Pham Hong Son. </p><p> </p><p>Department of Labor (DOL), with Embassy assistance, launched </p><p>four projects with human rights dimensions.  While freedom </p><p>of association remained a problem, the GVN agreed to a DOL </p><p>program improving industrial relations through dispute </p><p>prevention and settlement.  It will train representatives of </p><p>seventy enterprises in collective bargaining, problem </p><p>solving, and dispute resolution as well as establish </p><p>industrial relations advisory centers and a national </p><p>training institute.  A second program will improve </p><p>employment opportunities for people with disabilities </p><p>through a review of relevant legislation, remodeling ten </p><p>Employment Service Centers, training their staffs, and </p><p>raising public awareness.  A third project, launched on </p><p>February 19, 2003), will address the prevention, withdrawal, </p><p>and rehabilitation of child labor through strengthening the </p><p>capacity of government agencies.  A fourth, begun in early </p><p>2003, will establish policies to prevent discrimination in </p><p>the workplace against HIV/AIDS positive employees. </p><p> </p><p>The USG-funded Support for Trade Acceleration (STAR) </p><p>Project, to facilitate the implementation of the U.S.- </p><p>Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement, includes components aimed </p><p>at promoting transparency and rule of law that benefit human </p><p>rights.  STAR trains lawyers and judges; the project has </p><p>stimulated greater efforts to ensure that new and amended </p><p>laws conform to international treaties and has achieved </p><p>significant concrete results.  Full implementation of the </p><p>BTA will have a substantial impact on Vietnam\'s system of </p><p>governance.  Required legal reforms specifically mandate </p><p>greater transparency and due process in the legal system. </p><p>Although it will take some time for a reformed legal sector </p><p>to function as a protector of human rights, many of the </p><p>basic components will be put in place as a result of BTA </p><p>compliance. </p><p> </p><p>Post-obtained grant funding from EAP/RSP allowed the </p><p>International Organization for Migration (IOM) and The Asia </p><p>Foundation to carry out projects to combat trafficking in </p><p>persons.  The IOM project opened a shelter in Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City for underage trafficking victims who have been </p><p>repatriated from brothels in Cambodia and began expansion of </p><p>a reception center for trafficking victims closer to the </p><p>Cambodian border.  The Asia Foundation project, which </p><p>continued through year-end, worked with various government </p><p>and civil society organizations to highlight the dangers of </p><p>trafficking at the community level and provided economic </p><p>alternatives for high-risk groups. </p><p> </p><p>The Mission\'s Public Affairs Sections sponsored </p><p>International Visitors on human rights-related programs </p><p>including "Grassroots Democracy in the U.S.," "Laws and </p><p>Policies on Persons with Disabilities," and "The Role of the </p><p>Media in Promoting Civil Society."  PAS is sponsoring five </p><p>provincial workshops on grassroots democracy, which include </p><p>developing, publishing, and distributing pamphlets on human </p><p>rights, women\'s rights, children\'s rights, and legal rights. </p><p>PAS administered a grant-funded program that provided gender </p><p>education and women\'s leadership training in three </p><p>provinces.  PAS translated and distributed print and </p><p>electronic journals and documents on human rights themes. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
