MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In a June 29 meeting with the Ambassador, Finance </p><p>Minister Dr. Prakash Chandra Lohani said that the Government </p><p>of Nepal (GON) is preparing for another round of negotiations </p><p>with the Maoists and making some headway in persuading </p><p>political parties to join the new government.  He said that </p><p>while all parties may accept the need for social and </p><p>political change in Nepal, questions remain about the exact </p><p>nature of the change needed and how to manage it.  He </p><p>welcomed USG proposals to provide technical assistance to the </p><p>GON on WTO accession and undertook to look into the </p><p>contractual dispute between a U.S. investor and the Nepal </p><p>Electricity Authority.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>PEACE TALKS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Accompanied by DCM Robert Boggs and newly arrived </p><p>USAID Mission Director Donald Clark, on June 29 the </p><p>Ambassador called on newly appointed Finance Minister Dr. </p><p>Prakash Chandra Lohani.  Lohani, who received his MBA from </p><p>Indiana University and his PhD. from UCLA, has also been </p><p>named to head the Government of Nepal (GON) team to negotiate </p><p>with the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  According to Lohani, the two-man GON team has </p><p>already held two quiet, informal meetings with Maoist </p><p>representatives outside the glare of the media.  He remarked </p><p>that the Maoists recently have been "fairly aggressive" in </p><p>their claims that the GON is backtracking on commitments--for </p><p>example, the 5-km restriction for the Army (Ref A)--allegedly </p><p>made by the former GON team during the two previous rounds of </p><p>dialogue.  Since there was no written record kept of either </p><p>round, reconstructing what was said has been difficult, </p><p>Lohani said.  The new team has met with former GON </p><p>negotiators Ramesh Nath Pandey and Narayan Singh Pun, </p><p>however, and has concluded that the GON did not agree to the </p><p>5-km restriction. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Before embarking on a third round of dialogue, the </p><p>GON is in the process of working out basic, non-negotiable </p><p>long-term goals, Lohani said, which thus far include the </p><p>integrity of the nation, progressive social change, and </p><p>"saving the nation from plunging into further chaos."  In </p><p>their discussions with the Maoists, the GON team has proposed </p><p>putting aside the controversy about the 5-km restriction for </p><p>now, to which the Maoists provisionally agreed, Lohani </p><p>reported.  Maoist distrust of the GON persists, however, </p><p>Lohani observed, adding that the insurgents fear that "we\'re </p><p>trying to outwit them."  At the same time, the security </p><p>forces worry that the Maoists may be planning to break off </p><p>negotiations with a series of devastating surprise attacks as </p><p>they did in November 2001.  Despite this mutual mistrust, </p><p>Lohani described himself as "cautiously optimistic" about the </p><p>peace process, but added that he remains worried by Maoist </p><p>activism--specifically, continued extortion, conscription and </p><p>training--during the ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GON SEEKS PARTY PARTICIPATION FROM </p><p>"INSTITUTIONS," NOT "INDIVIDUALS" </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Lohani said the two-man GON negotiating team had been </p><p>kept small to allow room for representatives from other </p><p>political parties, should they decide to join the government. </p><p> The GON wants all the political parties to work together in </p><p>order to make elections possible, he asserted.  While </p><p>second-rank leaders seem more flexible about compromise than </p><p>their leadership, the GON has given up the idea of trying to </p><p>"break people out" of party ranks to join the Cabinet, he </p><p>said.  The GON now realizes that persuading individuals, </p><p>rather than the institutions themselves, to join a Cabinet is </p><p>neither productive nor desirable. </p><p>6.  (C)  The GON is gradually making progress toward this </p><p>goal, Lohani reported.  The parties are beginning to realize </p><p>that their street protests are not working and that only the </p><p>Maoists are benefiting from the poisonous political </p><p>atmosphere.  "Our arguments are having an effect," he </p><p>asserted.  The incestuous nature of Nepali domestic politics </p><p>helps in this regard, he observed.  Since "everyone is </p><p>related to everyone else" and Kathmandu is so small, rival </p><p>politicians still have ample opportunity to meet socially and </p><p>discuss otherwise sensitive matters amicably. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  He indicated that there is a certain amount of </p><p>hypocrisy among the parties as well.  Even though politicians </p><p>"talk a good game" about democratic ideals, as soon as they </p><p>get into power they immediately abandon this idealism and </p><p>insist on conformity with the party line. Nepali political </p><p>parties use democracy more as a campaign slogan than as an </p><p>operating principle, he charged.  While all parties accept </p><p>the idea that the Nepali political system is "too centralized </p><p>and feudal," there remains substantial debate about how best </p><p>to reform it.  Although the current system is unsatisfactory, </p><p>the Westminster system is "too formal for us."  Most </p><p>mainstream politicians seem to agree tht basic change to the </p><p>political system is needed, but disagree about the degree of </p><p>change needed, as well as how to manage and channel such </p><p>reform, he concluded. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>TRADE AND INVESTMENT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The Ambassador underscored USG support for Nepal\'s </p><p>attempts to accede to WTO, but noted that substantial </p><p>progress still must be made before accession is likely.  The </p><p>USG has offered the GON technical assistance on both customs </p><p>valuation and sanitary and phytosanitary measures but has yet </p><p>to receive the written requests needed before such aid can be </p><p>initiated.  Lohani promised to ensure that the necessary </p><p>request letters are sent soon.  The Ambassador also asked for </p><p>Lohani\'s assistance in helping to resolve the outstanding </p><p>contractual dispute between the Nepal Electricity Authority </p><p>(NEA) and the Bhote Koshi Power Company, in which the U.S. </p><p>company Panda holds a majority share.  (Note:  As Finance </p><p>Minister, Lohani sits on the NEA Board of Directors.  End </p><p>note.)  Some progress toward resolving the dispute amicably </p><p>had been made at the behest of former Water Resources </p><p>Minister Deepak Gyawali, the Ambassador said, but since the </p><p>June 4 Cabinet change the efforts seem to have stalled. </p><p>Lohani undertook to give his attention to the matter.  Lohani </p><p>also promised to waive the customs duty on ten electric </p><p>vehicles produced by REVA, an Indian/US joint venture. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Lohani is a thoughtful and engaging interlocutor who </p><p>is friendly toward the U.S.  We welcome his observation that </p><p>attempting to lure away individual second-tier leaders from </p><p>the recalcitrant parties could backfire.  Sources in contact </p><p>with the Maoists report their suspicion that the new </p><p>government and negotiating team will attempt to revisit </p><p>concessions already made--or purportedly made--by the </p><p>previous GON team.  Whether or not GON negotiators made the </p><p>5-km concession as the Maoists claim, we believe that </p><p>controversial issue should be walked back. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
