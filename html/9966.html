<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 002236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: LIBERIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIBERIA </p><p>1.   "Share the burden" </p><p>The conservative National Post opined (8/1): "Liberia\'s </p><p>14-year-old civil war may finally be ending. Last </p><p>Wednesday, the country\'s giant neighbour, </p><p>Nigeria, agreed to send 1,300 peacekeepers to help end </p><p>hostilities.... On Monday, the European Union voiced </p><p>support for a multilateral intervention -- but did not </p><p>promise funding for it. Also on Monday, Ottawa pledged </p><p>$1.75-million in humanitarian assistance to displaced </p><p>Liberians. We find it interesting, however, that these </p><p>moves came only after George W. Bush\'s July 4 decision </p><p>to send military observers to the war-plagued nation. </p><p>Two thousand U.S. Marines and three U.S. naval ships </p><p>are now en route to West Africa. This sequence of </p><p>events typifies the international community\'s standard </p><p>operating procedure when it comes to humanitarian </p><p>emergencies. It waits for the United States to agree to </p><p>do the heavy lifting, and then parcels out the less </p><p>onerous tasks. But U.S. manpower, capital and political </p><p>will have limits. Washington cannot be expected to bear </p><p>the burden of intervention during every crisis. What </p><p>the world needs is what international relations </p><p>theorists call \'burden sharing.\' Responsibility for </p><p>global public goods - such as international stability, </p><p>or the care and feeding of refugees - must be be </p><p>carried by a coalition of wealthy, Western states.... </p><p>Today\'s burden shirking may exact a high price </p><p>tomorrow. Isolationism always has a significant </p><p>constituency in the United States. And if ordinary </p><p>Americans gets the sense that their country\'s goodwill </p><p>is being exploited by other nations, they will retreat </p><p>from trouble spots like sub-Saharan Africa and the </p><p>Balkans entirely - emerging only to fight wars that </p><p>suit Washington\'s self-interest. The better strategy is </p><p>for Europe and Canada to ante up now, before it\'s too </p><p>late." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
