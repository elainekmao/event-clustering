<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 008165 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/13/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>SUBJECT: CAN AK PARTY REMOVE OBSTACLES TO PARTY LEADER </p><p>ERDOGAN\'S BECOMING P.M.? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 6856 ANKARA 6683 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On the surface of it, and given AK Party\'s </p><p>strong parliamentary majority, there should be a </p><p>straightforward, if sequential, legal way ahead for </p><p>disenfranchised AK Party chairman Erdogan to reclaim his </p><p>political rights, gain election to Parliament, and be </p><p>appointed Prime Minister.  However, resistance by some </p><p>elements of the Kemalist State and Establishment political </p><p>considerations cloaked in legalisms render the process, </p><p>timing, and result uncertain.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Nov. 14 the 550 M.P.s of Turkey\'s 22nd parliament take </p><p>their oath of office.  Directly thereafter, AK Party chairman </p><p>Erdogan, ruled ineligible to run for Parliament, and thus </p><p>ineligible for the prime-ministership under the current </p><p>constitution, is expected to meet President Sezer to try to </p><p>reach an understanding on whom Sezer will pick from AK to </p><p>form the next government.  Sezer is expected to give the </p><p>mandate Nov. 15 or 16; he will need to balance his right to </p><p>choose against Erdogan\'s desires as leader of a party with an </p><p>overwhelming parliamentary majority.  Forming the government, </p><p>including the built-in procedures for holding a vote of </p><p>confidence, could take two to three weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Given Erdogan\'s ambition to recover his political </p><p>rights and become Prime Minister, and AK voters\' expectation </p><p>that this will happen, the questions are (1) can AK blaze a </p><p>way for Erdogan through Turkey\'s thorny constitutional and </p><p>judicial thickets? and (2) will the Kemalist State tolerate </p><p>such a challenge, even if made slowly? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE LEGAL BARRIERS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The obstacles in Erdogan\'s way are Article 312(2) of </p><p>the Turkish Penal Code (TPC), Articles 76, 78 and 109 of the </p><p>1982 Constitution, and -- as AK vice chairmen Mercan and Aksu </p><p>acknowledged to us Nov. 12 and 13 -- resistance on the part </p><p>of what they called "certain power centers". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Erdogan was convicted in 1998 under Article 312(2) for </p><p>"inciting religious hatred" by reciting a poem in a 1997 </p><p>speech.  Article 312(2) was revised as part of the EU-related </p><p>reform package passed in August 2002, and a Diyarbakir State </p><p>Security Court ruled in September that Erdogan\'s record </p><p>should be erased because his speech no longer constituted a </p><p>crime under the revised language.  However, the High Court of </p><p>Appeals overruled the lower court decision; subsequently the </p><p>Supreme Election Board determined Erdogan ineligible to run </p><p>in the November 3 elections (reftels).  Article 76 of the </p><p>Constitution states that anyone convicted of "ideological" or </p><p>"anarchistic" activities, generally interpreted as including </p><p>anyone convicted under Article 312(2), is not eligible to be </p><p>elected to Parliament, even if pardoned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Article 78 of the Constitution states that </p><p>by-elections to the Parliament cannot be held until 30 months </p><p>have elapsed since the general elections, unless 5% (28) of </p><p>the seats are vacant, in which case they can be held </p><p>beginning three months after the general elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Article 109 of the Constitution states that the </p><p>President shall appoint the P.M. from among the members of </p><p>Parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Erdogan, therefore, cannot currently be named P.M. </p><p>because he is not a member of Parliament.  He cannot run for </p><p>the current Parliament unless his political rights are </p><p>restored and by-elections can be conducted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>KEMALIST RELUCTANCE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Kemalist State, which in Turkey is in some ways </p><p>markedly separate from, and more powerful than, the political </p><p>party arena (septel), is at best wary toward moves to enable </p><p>Erdogan to become P.M.  President Sezer has publicly warned </p><p>that attempts to change laws or amend the constitution for </p><p>the benefit of specific individuals would politicize the Law. </p><p> Sezer is also concerned that amending Article 109 to permit </p><p>someone not in Parliament to be nominated as P.M. would </p><p>fundamentally alter the parliamentary character of Turkey\'s </p><p>political system.  Echoing this latter concern, one leading </p><p>Establishment press commentator declared that such an </p><p>amendment would leave Turkey with a "half-breed" system, </p><p>neither parliamentary nor presidential.  Opposition CHP </p><p>leader Baykal has voiced opinions parallel to those of Sezer; </p><p>Baykal\'s expression of willingness to consider ways to help </p><p>Erdogan is ringed with conditions which AK is likely to find </p><p>unpalatable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) On one level of rectitude, Sezer\'s argument </p><p>concerning the consequences for Turkey\'s parliamentary system </p><p>is logical.  Making this argument also allows him to hint </p><p>that AK\'s choice of this route could provoke the kind of </p><p>political confrontation AK does not want between a highly </p><p>popular (though indirectly elected) President and a highly </p><p>popular (though unelected) party chairman whose constituents </p><p>want to see as P.M. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) However, concerning the politicization of the Law, </p><p>senior AK officials as well as a broad section of Turkish </p><p>society consider the Turkish constitution and laws already </p><p>subject to arbitrary and political interpretation.  One </p><p>recent example cited in the press and on the street: Erdogan </p><p>was ruled ineligible to run for Parliament in a controversial </p><p>decision while Motorola deadbeat Cem Uzan was allowed to run </p><p>a campaign which violated the election and broadcasting laws </p><p>in a wholesale manner.  AK vice chairman Aksu also voiced to </p><p>us the party\'s view that Sezer has politicized his office and </p><p>in doing so has given the impression that he favors the </p><p>Establishment CHP, which is the sole opposition party in the </p><p>new Parliament.  AK is still wont to argue that since the </p><p>President of Turkey can be elected from outside Parliament </p><p>(e.g., Sezer), criteria for selecting the P.M. should be no </p><p>different. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Another contact, a former National Security Council </p><p>staffer who served in the military\'s West Working Group </p><p>(WWG), which helped execute the "post-modern" coup to remove </p><p>then-P.M. Erbakan from power in 1997, observed to us Nov. 8 </p><p>that there are "hard-line" senior Turkish military officers </p><p>who will not willingly come to terms with Erdogan or other </p><p>top AK officials formerly associated with Erbakan.  He </p><p>claimed that the WWG, under a new name, has been up and </p><p>running again in a monitoring mode since May 2002.  On the </p><p>other hand, TGS Chief Gen. Ozkok has made it clear here and </p><p>in his just-concluded U.S. trip that the Turkish military </p><p>accepts AK\'s victory and will work with the new government </p><p>(AK vice chairman Aksu told us Ozkok sent a congratulatory </p><p>telegram to Erdogan).  Other high-ranking TGS generals had </p><p>said the same, and told us the view was widespread within the </p><p>General Staff, even before the election when it was clear AK </p><p>would gain a plurality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Other challenges face Erdogan.  He is still a </p><p>defendant in several trials brought by the State against him </p><p>for alleged corruption as mayor of Istanbul 1994-98.  Any </p><p>conviction would render him ineligible to restore his </p><p>political rights for a further three years beyond the end of </p><p>a new sentence.  At the same time, the Chief Prosecutor is </p><p>seeking to force Erdogan to resign as party chairman; if </p><p>Erdogan were to restore his political rights and get into </p><p>Parliament as an ordinary member of AK, he might not benefit </p><p>from the customary practice that the President gives the </p><p>mandate to form a government to the (M.P.) chairman of the </p><p>largest party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>POSSIBLE LEGAL REMEDIES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Opinions are divided among the legal experts we have </p><p>consulted, but it may not be necessary for AK to revise </p><p>Article 312(2) further in order for Erdogan to become </p><p>eligible to run for Parliament.  Those convicted under </p><p>Article 312 can apply to a civil court to win back their </p><p>right to run for office three years after serving their </p><p>sentence.  Erdogan will be able to apply to have his rights </p><p>restored in February 2003. </p><p>15. (U) Although AK has not formally indicated its </p><p>intentions, the party is considering options including </p><p>amending constitutional Articles 76 and 78 and possibly 109, </p><p>as well as TCP Article 312 as insurance against legal </p><p>challenges by the Chief Prosecutor which AK and many others </p><p>expect.  Article 76 prohibits those pardoned for certain </p><p>crimes from running for office; a court decision restoring </p><p>Erdogan\'s political rights would appear to be different from </p><p>a pardon, but AK may try to amend both Article 76 and Article </p><p>312 to eliminate any possible doubts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) AK is also considering whether to seek amendment of </p><p>Article 78 in order to hold by-elections sooner than in three </p><p>months and without having to vacate 5% of the seats, a number </p><p>which would, vice chairman Aksu acknowledged, give the </p><p>by-elections the character of a referendum on the </p><p>government\'s performance.  If AK is successful in amending </p><p>Article 78, it would plan to vacate one seat and have Erdogan </p><p>run.  An alternative is to challenge the voting results in </p><p>Siirt province, where a significant number of voters was </p><p>reportedly denied access to the polling booths, although the </p><p>Supreme Election Board\'s Nov. 9 certification of the results </p><p>and other factors make it improbable that such a challenge </p><p>would stand.  If Erdogan were elected to Parliament in a </p><p>by-election, he could arrange to have the government resign </p><p>and then expect be appointed P.M., although Sezer would not </p><p>be constitutionally bound to select him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) Regarding a constitutional amendment, AK has 363 </p><p>votes, thus 33 more than the minimum needed, although with </p><p>330 to 366 votes an amendment is automatically subject to a </p><p>national referendum.  AK will need four of the nine </p><p>independent M.P.\'s votes to pass an amendment with a </p><p>two-thirds majority (367), which still leaves the amendment </p><p>subject to a national referendum if the President insists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) A solution which both satisfies Erdogan\'s and his </p><p>grassroots\' aspirations and keeps the State calm depends on: </p><p>(a) Erdogan\'s ability to control his impatience, to move at a </p><p>judicious if steady pace, and to avoid being seen as </p><p>confronting basic symbols of the Kemalist State; (b) Sezer\'s </p><p>ability to temper his prerogatives, statist views and </p><p>wariness of AK with political realism in the face of a party </p><p>which has won an overwhelming parliamentary majority owing to </p><p>the popularity of its leader. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
