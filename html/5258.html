<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ISTANBUL 000096 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EFIN, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S JANUARY 14 EXCHANGES WITH ISTANBUL </p><p>BUSINESS, ACADEMIC AND MEDIA LEADERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 392 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In a series of January 14 discussions, the </p><p>Ambassador reassured prominent Turkish businessmen, </p><p>academics, and journalists that there is no crisis in </p><p>U.S.-Turkish relations.   He outlined in general terms the </p><p>USG-GOT discussions on Iraq, and made the case that the </p><p>status quo in Iraq is detrimental to Turkey\'s long-term </p><p>interests.  He criticized wildly inflated estimates of damage </p><p>from an Iraq operation that have appeared in the Turkish </p><p>media.   Ultimately, he said, the U.S. will accept whatever </p><p>Turkey decides and plan accordingly, but the window for a </p><p>Northern Flank option is narrowing rapidly.  His </p><p>interlocutors made clear that the Iraq operation, and </p><p>particularly the introduction of U.S. ground troops through </p><p>Turkey, will be a tough sell, but that a UN mandate and </p><p>broader European and Middle East support would aid the </p><p>effort.  All three groups were critical of GOT Iraq policy, </p><p>however, as contradictory, indecisive, and short on vision. </p><p>And despite negative public opinion, all recognized that if a </p><p>conflict is inevitable, Turkey\'s interests would be best </p><p>served by cooperating with the anti-Iraq coalition.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In each discussion, Ambassador stressed that despite </p><p>sensationalist press stories, there is no crisis in </p><p>U.S.-Turkish relations.  He expressed confidence that the two </p><p>sides will reach a mutually acceptable arrangement on support </p><p>for a U.S. operation.  Continuance of the status quo is </p><p>clearly not in Turkey\'s interest, he argued, suggesting that </p><p>there are clear benefits that would flow to Turkey from a </p><p>regime change in its southern neighbor.  He challenged his </p><p>interlocutors to think proactively about Turkey\'s future </p><p>international role and to take a strategic, long-term </p><p>approach to regional stability.  He also asked for support in </p><p>calming fears about the potential impact on Turkey of an </p><p>operation, noting that estimates of USD 100-140 billion in </p><p>damage are wildly exaggerated.  The U.S., he stressed, is </p><p>committed to providing aid that will effectively address the </p><p>impact an operation might have on Turkey (leading investment </p><p>houses estimate the impact at 4-15 billion USD).  The </p><p>assistance numbers, while large, will not resonate unless </p><p>current exaggerated public fears are addressed, he stressed. </p><p>Ultimately, he said, the U.S. will accept Turkey\'s decision </p><p>and plan accordingly, but the window for a Northern Flank </p><p>option is narrowing rapidly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to the businessmen, academics, and </p><p>journalists, the task of selling an operation to the Turkish </p><p>public will be difficult: not only are over 80 percent of </p><p>Turks opposed, but the newly-elected Justice and Development </p><p>(AK) Party\'s base consists of the strongest opposition.  As </p><p>Yeni Safak columnist Cengiz Candar put it, "Given their </p><p>mindset and upbringing, these guys never imagined that they </p><p>might be the ones to invite U.S. troops into the region." </p><p>While no one disputed the Ambassador\'s characterization of </p><p>the damage estimates on the Turkish economy as "inflated," </p><p>some voiced skepticism about the USG\'s ability to shepherd a </p><p>package through the Congress (the Ambassador remarked that </p><p>early, whole-hearted Turkish cooperation would help make that </p><p>task easier).  Most were somewhat critical of the AK </p><p>government\'s recent indecision and mixed messages, pointing </p><p>particularly to State Minister Tuzman\'s visit to Iraq and the </p><p>failure to begin preparing public opinion for a decision to </p><p>cooperate on Iraq.  Turkish conglomerate head Sakip Sabanci </p><p>questioned the government\'s difficulty in choosing between </p><p>its "loyal" ally in Washington and Baghdad and expressed </p><p>whole-hearted support for TUSIAD President Ozilhan\'s January </p><p>13 critique of the government (reftel).  In the end, most </p><p>agreed that assuming a war is inevitable, Turkey will suffer </p><p>economically whether it participates or not.  Personal views </p><p>on Iraq aside (Bilgi University professor Soli Ozel opined </p><p>that "the U.S. has not yet made a case for a just war"), </p><p>Turkey will be best served by cooperating.   The consensus, </p><p>however, was that another UNSCR and wide European and Middle </p><p>East support will be crucial to getting Turkish support, </p><p>although opening bases to U.S. ground troops may still be too </p><p>tall an order for the AK government. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
