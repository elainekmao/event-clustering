The trial of American citizen Andrew Meldrum, the </p><p>   Zimbabwe correspondent for "The Guardian," begins on </p><p>   June 12 at the Harare Magistrate\'s Court.  Meldrum was </p><p>   charged with "publishing falsehoods," a violation of </p><p>   the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy </p><p>   Act (AIPPA) after reporting the now-disproved story of </p><p>   a woman beheaded by ruling party supporters. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Meldrum\'s lawyer believes the case would be </p><p>   dismissed quickly under normal circumstances.  We </p><p>   know, however, that there is high-level Government of </p><p>   Zimbabwe interest in the case that may make normal </p><p>   court proceedings difficult. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Meldrum and two other journalists working for the </p><p>   international media have filed a suit challenging the </p><p>   constitutionality of sections of AIPPA.  If decided in </p><p>   the applicants\' favor, that case would render moot the </p><p>   outcome of Meldrum\'s trial before the Harare </p><p>   magistrate.  The High Court, however, decided that the </p><p>   constitutional challenge to AIPPA was not urgent.  We </p><p>   will report on further developments as necessary. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
