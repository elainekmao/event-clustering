<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 000053 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB/TPP </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, ECON, BM, Economy, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: WHAT\'S BEST FOR BURMA? UNCLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 45 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. During a conversation with David Rockefeller </p><p>at the Chief of Mission\'s residence on January 12th, Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi talked about the need for a speedy transition, the </p><p>dangerous state of the nation\'s education system, and her </p><p>growing public support outside Rangoon.  Unfortunately, ASSK </p><p>had little to say to Mr. Rockefeller\'s repeated question: </p><p>"what can we do to help?"  However, she made it evident that </p><p>she still opposed "engagement," though additional blanket </p><p>sanctions were also not the answer.  She did tout working </p><p>with the International Labor Organization (ILO) to identify </p><p>and punish export-focused factories with unacceptable working </p><p>conditions.  However until there is a clear public </p><p>pronouncement from her, we see little chance that the </p><p>international community will alter its varied interpretations </p><p>of what\'s "best" for Burma.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Rockefeller Comes to Rangoon </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) David Rockefeller and his traveling party came to </p><p>Burma for a 10-day tourist trip throughout the country. </p><p>While here he took the opportunity to meet with local </p><p>business leaders and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK), and plans </p><p>to meet with Secretary One, General Khin Nyunt.  ASSK joined </p><p>the Rockefeller party at the Chief of Mission\'s residence for </p><p>an informal Sunday tea and discussion about the current </p><p>situation in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Sanctions: Psychological Not Economic Damage </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Three times David Rockefeller, and other members of </p><p>his party, pressed ASSK about "what the United States </p><p>could/should be doing" to help expedite change here.  Though </p><p>ASSK was adamant that "speedy change" was essential, she did </p><p>not give specific prescriptions for how U.S. policy could </p><p>force the issue.  She mentioned only that there should be </p><p>better policy coordination between nations and between </p><p>international organizations. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On sanctions, ASSK was more specific.  She insisted </p><p>that while sanctions caused minimal economic damage to the </p><p>regime, the "psychological impact" has been significant.  She </p><p>pointed to the informal boycott of tourism as helping to foil </p><p>the regime\'s ballyhooed efforts to make Burma a major tourist </p><p>destination.  Such a boycott, she said, also has an impact on </p><p>the government\'s pocketbook and has the residual benefit of </p><p>preventing Burma from being a country over reliant on tourism </p><p>for hard currency earnings.  ASSK did admit that there was </p><p>some benefit to travelers coming to Burma if they take the </p><p>time to "learn as much as possible about the country." (Note: </p><p>despite ASSK\'s support of the informal boycott, she has told </p><p>us on several occasions she opposes an outright tourism ban. </p><p>We note that despite her reluctance to have Burma become </p><p>reliant on tourism, currently the industry provides one of </p><p>the very few relatively well-paying job opportunities for </p><p>English speaking young people.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On the question of textile sanctions, ASSK was a bit </p><p>less sanguine about their benefits.  She does not support </p><p>full-scale sanctions because of the disproportionate damage </p><p>they would cause to working people.  Instead, she said, more </p><p>creative solutions were needed to focus as much as possible </p><p>on helping the workers while attacking the regime.  One idea, </p><p>she suggested, was to team up with the International Labor </p><p>Organization (ILO) to require inspections of all </p><p>export-producing garment factories in Burma.  Only those that </p><p>the ILO certified as providing healthy working environments </p><p>would be allowed to export to the United States.  She added </p><p>that exports could be banned outright from the few factories </p><p>that were controlled in whole or in part by the government. </p><p>(Note: we\'d heard indirectly of this proposal before, but it </p><p>was the first time she\'d mentioned to us directly.  It shows </p><p>a clear position of ASSK against broad trade sanctions that </p><p>would hurt labor-intensive industries.  However, as </p><p>inspections are not part of the ILO\'s mandate here we will </p><p>have to follow up with the local ILO representative to assess </p><p>the feasibility of this idea.) </p><p>International Community is Losing its Way </p><p>6. (C) ASSK had sharp words for countries that she saw moving </p><p>toward policies of engagement with the SPDC regime.  She said </p><p>that engagement with the regime helped its efforts to justify </p><p>its own existence and policies, making it harder to convince </p><p>the SPDC to step down.  She singled out Japan and Australia </p><p>for having "less than helpful" attitudes.  Specifically she </p><p>criticized Japan\'s "reluctance to offend" and recent decision </p><p>to forgive $1.3 billion in debt (see reftel).  She said this </p><p>move, along with China\'s offer to give $200 million in soft </p><p>loans to Burma, will give a large psychological (though not a </p><p>large economic) boost to the regime.  Australia, she said, </p><p>while giving "lip service" to democracy is actually more </p><p>"ASEAN than ASEAN" in its relations with the regime and its </p><p>reluctance to rock the boat.  (Note: ASSK was likely </p><p>referring to the Australians\' work with the regime on a human </p><p>rights training program.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ASSK was less critical of ASEAN members and China. </p><p>She said that none of these countries actively supports </p><p>democracy in Burma, but at least they are "honest" about </p><p>their true positions.  Twice she mentioned the PRC, saying </p><p>that while it is no friend of democracy, it is very pragmatic </p><p>and appreciates stability.  She thought it would be </p><p>worthwhile to work with China to convince them to take "a </p><p>more pragmatic approach" at least to border issues (e.g., </p><p>drug production and smuggling).  It will also be important, </p><p>she said, to include China in international cooperative </p><p>efforts to make change here. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) She was slightly less charitable about Malaysian </p><p>leader Dr. Mahatir, who was not given permission to see ASSK </p><p>during his latest trip to Rangoon.  She said that she was </p><p>unhappy he did not take the initiative to come and see her, </p><p>instead asking the regime for permission.  In addition, it </p><p>was a "pity," she said, that following his visit Dr. Mahatir </p><p>did not come out publicly to express his disappointment about </p><p>his treatment by the regime. </p><p> </p><p>Political Situation: Improving, But too Slow </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Rockefeller group was interested generally in the </p><p>current political state of play.  She said that repression of </p><p>the people has decreased since she and the SPDC began their </p><p>"exchange of views" in September 2000.  She was also </p><p>encouraged by seeing on her travels the amount of grassroots </p><p>support for her and the NLD.  On her recent trips to Shan and </p><p>Arakan States, she said that she was received even more </p><p>warmly than she had been during her travels in 1988-89, just </p><p>prior to the 1990 elections.  Another difference from \'88-\'89 </p><p>is the increased support she\'s noticed from young people and </p><p>members of various ethnic nationalities.   On a negative </p><p>note, she insisted that the regime\'s talk of change is only </p><p>superficial, aimed cynically only at improving its </p><p>international image. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Despite the positives, ASSK was very concerned that </p><p>change was coming far too slowly.  She joked about those who </p><p>advise her to be "patient" or "go slow," saying "slow is one </p><p>thing, a snail\'s pace is another."  The longer change takes, </p><p>she warned, the more difficult it will be to restart the </p><p>country under a new government.  She said that this was a </p><p>particular problem because of the current state of the </p><p>education system.  Very few young people today, except those </p><p>affiliated with the military or those who can study abroad, </p><p>are getting a quality education.  There is a very real </p><p>concern that Burma will soon become a country of "uneducated </p><p>people," with terrible consequences for the nation\'s </p><p>political and economic future.  She said that the current </p><p>regime\'s hostility toward education and economic reform is </p><p>the primary reason that Burma cannot develop along the lines </p><p>of other previously military-ruled Asian nations (namely </p><p>Taiwan and South Korea), where government support for </p><p>education remained strong. </p><p> </p><p>Policy Changes Apparent, but Not Public </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Based on this discussion, and others we\'ve had with </p><p>her in recent months, ASSK\'s position may be shifting ever so </p><p>slightly.  She recognizes the increasing humanitarian </p><p>catastrophe that is occurring here because of the regime\'s </p><p>neglect.  She is skittish of additional sanctions because of </p><p>their huge economic impact on the people, and limited </p><p>economic impact on the regime.  One of ASSK\'s economic </p><p>advisors has told us privately that he is pushing her hard to </p><p>publicly open up for additional international assistance </p><p>(carefully monitored and disbursed so as to avoid the </p><p>government) for education and basic healthcare.  ASSK did </p><p>not, however, take the opportunity of having a supportive and </p><p>sympathetic Mr. Rockefeller on hand to clearly propose any </p><p>significant new directions.  We have told ASSK, and will </p><p>continue to do so, that it is essential that she speak out </p><p>directly if she wants the international community to follow </p><p>her lead in revising its collective Burma policies.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
