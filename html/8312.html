<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 002293 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/PPD, NEA/ARP, INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) GOK PUSH TO AMEND PRESS LAW:  CAUSE FOR CONCERN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON: 1.6X6 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The GOK is making a strong push to gain </p><p>passage of a new press law before the  National Assembly </p><p>session ends June 10.  The bill contains a number of </p><p>provisions that would restrict current press freedoms. </p><p>Ruling-family politics appear to be a factor in this latest </p><p>push to amend the press law -- one of several since </p><p>Liberation.  In what may be a sign that the GOK is willing to </p><p>play hardball, on May 19 it froze the assets of Shaykh Ali </p><p>al-Khalifa al-Sabah, principal owner of the newspaper whose </p><p>publisher most vociferously opposes the draft law, ostensibly </p><p>because it just now decided there are serious allegations </p><p>against Shaykh Ali that need to be investigated in relation </p><p>to a scandal that broke ten years ago over events dating back </p><p>to 1984.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Local media have carried a number of articles in </p><p>recent weeks regarding the GOK\'s draft Press and Publications </p><p>Law.  In a meeting with PAO, PAS FSN and PolChief May 20, </p><p>Mohammed al-Jassem (protect throughout), publisher and </p><p>editor-in-chief of the daily newspaper Al-Watan, said that </p><p>he, as a trained lawyer, has taken the lead in critiquing the </p><p>bill, drawing up a memorandum to the Minister of Information </p><p>that was signed by all the editors-in-chief of Kuwaiti </p><p>dailies in January 2002.  Key elements: </p><p> </p><p>- The Prosecutor General would have the power to suspend </p><p>publication of a newspaper without filing criminal charges, </p><p>if he determined that it published anything against Kuwait\'s </p><p>interest or worked for another country.  (Al-Jassem commented </p><p>that these criteria are so vague they could encompass </p><p>anything the Government wanted them to.  He said the current </p><p>law requires a decision by the entire Council of Ministers in </p><p>order to close down a newspaper.) </p><p> </p><p>- The Prosecutor General could veto any advertisements, which </p><p>would put the financial health of newspapers at his mercy. </p><p> </p><p>- The Minister of Information would have the power to close </p><p>down printing presses. </p><p> </p><p>- Publication of any article would be subject to prior </p><p>censorship. </p><p> </p><p>- Publication of the proceedings of closed sessions of </p><p>parliament or the Cabinet would be prohibited.  (Al-Jassem </p><p>said this provision is in response to court rulings affirming </p><p>the right and responsibility of the press to report on closed </p><p>sessions.) </p><p> </p><p>- The ban on offending Islam, God or the Prophet Mohammed </p><p>would be reinforced with stiffer fines and expanded to </p><p>encompass offenses to "the foundations of doctrine" (a </p><p>worrisomely vague term, in Al-Jassem\'s estimation, who noted </p><p>that the editors-in-chief\'s joint memorandum called for </p><p>eliminating "hisba," the right of any Muslim to file criminal </p><p>charges against anyone who defames Islam). </p><p> </p><p>- Offending a judicial person would be banned. </p><p> </p><p>- The editor-in-chief as well as the author of an offending </p><p>article would both be liable, even if the editor-in-chief was </p><p>out of the country at the time the article was published. </p><p>(Al-Jassem said this provision is based on the principle of </p><p>"presumed responsibility" which has been found </p><p>unconstitutional in Egypt.) </p><p> </p><p>- The bill recommends that no new licenses be issued for </p><p>newspapers.  (Al-Jassem said his newspaper supports the </p><p>principle of competition, therefore it opposes this </p><p>provision.) </p><p> </p><p>- A recent addition to the draft would prohibit press </p><p>"campaigns," which could mean as few as two or three articles </p><p>on a given subject.  (Al-Jassem gave an example:  one article </p><p>criticizing Syria would be acceptable, but two would be a </p><p>campaign.  He said this provision is a reaction to what the </p><p>GOK perceives as US media campaigns against Saudi Arabia.) </p><p> </p><p>- On the positive side, the bill would eliminate jail </p><p>sentences for press offenses (except for affronts to </p><p>religion), but it would increase fines to as much as 10,000 </p><p>Kuwaiti Dinars (approx. USD 33,000). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Al-Jassem summarized the saga of the Press and </p><p>Publications bill as follows:  it is essentially the same </p><p>text that every Information Minister since Liberation has </p><p>tried to push through the National Assembly.  The current </p><p>Information Minister, the young Shaykh Ahmed al-Fahd al-Ahmed </p><p>al-Sabah, whose main interest was sports until he was </p><p>handpicked by his uncle First Deputy Prime Minister and </p><p>Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmed, is now trying to </p><p>prove his worth to Shaykh Sabah, "an enemy of the press," in </p><p>hopes of gaining a more prestigious portfolio in the Cabinet </p><p>reshuffle that will follow the July 5 National Assembly </p><p>general election.  Faced with the united opposition of the </p><p>editors, Shaykh Ahmed went directly to the Kuwait Journalists </p><p>Association to obtain support, and misled the National </p><p>Assembly\'s Committee on Education, Culture and Guidance into </p><p>believing the bill enjoyed broad acceptance.  When disabused </p><p>by the editors, the Committee agreed to freeze consideration </p><p>of the bill until after the general election.  Now, to </p><p>everyone\'s surprise, the GOK is making a fresh push to gain </p><p>passage, even though there are only four more days of </p><p>scheduled sessions on the National Assembly\'s calendar before </p><p>it adjourns for the elections.  Al-Watan is putting editorial </p><p>pressure on key MPs to try to prevent the bill from passing. </p><p>Al-Jassem thought he would succeed in blocking the GOK, </p><p>because the MPs know his newspaper could "destroy" them if </p><p>they abet the regime\'s attempt to muzzle the press. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In response to Emboffs\' questioning, Al-Jassem gave </p><p>details of GOK action taken the previous day against the </p><p>owner of Al-Watan, Shaykh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, who was </p><p>Minister of Oil in 1990.  He said Shaykh Ali was banned from </p><p>traveling outside the country (although he is already in the </p><p>US to attend his son\'s graduation), his personal assets were </p><p>frozen (not including Al-Watan, which he owns indirectly in </p><p>conjunction with 35 partners), and two men were appointed to </p><p>manage his assets.  All these actions were taken because the </p><p>GOK just now decided that serious allegations exist against </p><p>Shaykh Ali that require investigation, in connection with the </p><p>so-called "oil tankers case" which erupted in 1993 regarding </p><p>events dating back to 1984.  Al-Jassem was </p><p>uncharacteristically reluctant to accuse the GOK of trying to </p><p>get at him through Shaykh Ali, but he allowed that the timing </p><p>was remarkably coincidental after all these years.  He </p><p>further claimed that a ten-year statute of limitations </p><p>applies.  (Comment:  To be fair to the GOK this case was </p><p>given new impetus lately with the extradition of a key figure </p><p>in the investigation from the U.S.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Throughout the conversation with Emboffs, Al-Jassem </p><p>portrayed himself as the only person in Kuwait who dares </p><p>speak scathingly of Shaykh Sabah to his face.  He claimed to </p><p>have told the 74-year-old de facto ruler that he was "too </p><p>old" to be governing the country. He also claimed to have </p><p>told Shaykh Ahmed al-Fahd that he had a great future as one </p><p>of the few younger-generation members of the ruling family </p><p>who could revitalize Kuwait, but that he was throwing away </p><p>his future by tying himself to Shaykh Sabah, whose enmity for </p><p>the media and for democracy would destroy the country. </p><p>Almost as an aside, Al-Jassem remarked that Al-Watan was the </p><p>only newspaper that supported last summer\'s parliamentary </p><p>"grilling" of then-Finance Minister Yusuf al-Ibrahim. </p><p>(COMMENT:  If successful, the grilling could have forced </p><p>al-Ibrahim out of office, or even brought down the entire </p><p>Cabinet.  In the event, al-Ibrahim survived the vote of </p><p>no-confidence, though he has since resigned.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  There is obviously a great deal of personal </p><p>enmity in Al-Jassem\'s account, but the specific elements he </p><p>cited as points of concern regarding the draft Press and </p><p>Publications Law track with our own understanding.  He also </p><p>shared copies of matrices showing differences between the </p><p>current law and the bill, and between the bill and the </p><p>parliamentary committee\'s position.  (We have no reason to </p><p>doubt the veracity of this analysis.)    Without getting </p><p>embroiled in local politics, we will endeavor to find ways to </p><p>remind the GOK of the centrality of press freedom in our </p><p>values and in US foreign policy.  If nothing else this will </p><p>put the lie to any malicious allegations of U.S. acceptance </p><p>of or complicity in this misbegotten GOK initiative. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
