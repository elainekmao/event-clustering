<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 220237 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, TU, AM </p><p>SUBJECT:  PKK SUPPORT FROM ARMENIAN SOURCES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ADANA 369 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  DEPARTMENT HAS SEEN REPORTS OF PRIVATE ARMENIAN </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE PKK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THIS IS CAUSE OF CONCERN TO THE DEPARTMENT.  AS THE </p><p>PKK IS A KNOWN TERRORIST GROUP, ANY TYPE OF ARMENIAN </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE PKK WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OPINION OF ARMENIA AND ARMENIAN CAUSES.  ARMENIAN CONTACTS </p><p>WITH THE PKK WOULD HAVE DETRIMENTAL CONSEQUENCES FOR GOA </p><p>RELATIONS WITH TURKEY.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE </p><p>TURKISH PUBLIC WILL FAIL TO MAKE ANY DISTINCTION BETWEEN </p><p>PRIVATE ARMENIAN EFFORTS TO HELP THE PKK AND OFFICIAL GOA </p><p>BACKING OF THE PKK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  DEPARTMENT WOULD APPRECIATE AN EMBASSY REPORT ON </p><p>POSSIBLE PKK-ARMENIAN LINKS, AND ASKS EMBASSY YEREVAN TO </p><p>CONTINUE MONITORING THE SITUATION CLOSELY AND TO KEEP US </p><p>INFORMED.  WE WANT TO WEIGH IN FIRMLY WITH YEREVAN IF </p><p>THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE OF TRAINING, SANCTUARY OR EVIDENCE </p><p>OF AID FOR THE PKK MATERIALIZING IN ARMENIA.  WE WILL OF </p><p>COURSE, HOLD OFF MENTIONING THIS TO THE TURKS UNTIL WE </p><p>HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE ARMENIANS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON A SEPARATE TOPIC, DEPARTMENT WOULD APPRECIATE </p><p>EMBASSY\'S INSIGHTS ON PRESIDENT TER-PETROSYAN\'S ATTENDANCE </p><p>OF ASALA MAMBER MONTE MELKONIAN\'S FUNERAL.  WHAT ARE THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF TER-PETROSYAN\'S PRESENCE?  IS ASALA </p><p>REGARDED AS A LEGITIMATE ENTITY IN ARMENIA?  PRESIDENT </p><p>TER-PETROSYAN\'S PRESENCE AT THE FUNERAL OF A KNOWN ASALA </p><p>TERRORIST IS LIKELY TO INFLAME TURKISH PUBLIC OPINION AND </p><p>COULD SERVE AS ANOTHER EXCUSE TO POSTPONE NORMALIZATION OF </p><p>TURKISH-ARMENIAN RELATIONS.  WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY LIGHT </p><p>EMBASSY CAN SHED ON TER-PETROSYAN\'S MOTIVATION IN </p><p>ATTENDING THE FUNERAL, THE GOA VIEW OF DIASPORA ARMENIANS </p><p>WITH TERRORIST CONNECTIONS, AND GOA ACTIONS, IF ANY, TO </p><p>REASSURE THE TURKS ON THIS MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTOPHER </p><p></p></div>
