<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001351 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WIN DAYTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ASEC, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC REQUESTS MEETINGS WITH POTUS DELEGATION IN RSA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request; please see paragraph two. </p><p> </p><p>Summary and Action Request: </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MDC Presidential Advisor, Gandi Mudzingwa, requested </p><p>meetings with member(s) of the POTUS delegation at whatever </p><p>level would be appropriate for an MDC delegation that will be </p><p>traveling to South Africa soon.  Mudzingwa said the main </p><p>message the MDC would like to convey is that the MDC is open </p><p>to restarting dialogue with Mugabe, but Mugabe has scuttled </p><p>all initiatives in this vein.  We provisionally recommend a </p><p>meeting with AS Kansteiner.  End Summary and Action Request. </p><p> </p><p>Meetings in RSA Requested </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 1 MDC Presidential Advisor, Gandi Mudzingwa, </p><p>requested meetings at whatever level would be appropriate for </p><p>an MDC delegation that will be traveling to South Africa for </p><p>the POTUS visit.  MDC Deputy Secretary General, Gift </p><p>Chimanikire is heading a political delegation that will also </p><p>include Shadow Minister of Justice, David Coltart, and </p><p>Secretary for Economic Affairs, Tendai Biti.  Paul </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Themba-Nyathi, MDC spokesperson, is also heading a separate </p><p>public affairs delegation. </p><p> </p><p>Roadmap to Peace? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Although a June 27 Reuters article reported that the </p><p>party\'s President Morgan Tsvangirai said the MDC was </p><p>developing a "roadmap to peace" to present to the Bush </p><p>delegation, the following is all that has evolved of this </p><p>initiative thus far: </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The two sides in Zimbabwe are not talking (this is in </p><p>response to news reports of Mbeki\'s comments that ZANU-PF and </p><p>MDC are talking).  The MDC believes that ZANU-PF would like </p><p>to manage the crisis and buy time and ensure ZANU-PF </p><p>succession, rather than solve the crisis.  Rather than </p><p>opening up to talks, Mugabe has in fact scuttled various </p><p>initiatives at restarting dialogue, or played one off the </p><p>other.  The MDC, in contrast, is open to dialogue. </p><p>Tsvangirai has requested a meeting with the Ambassador for </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>July 4 in which Mudzingwa said Tsvangirai plans to deliver </p><p>the MDC message to us in greater detail. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Mudzingwa said that domestically, the MDC is looking </p><p>for a formula to restart negotiations with Mugabe.  In </p><p>response to conflicting reports that the MDC would both </p><p>support and not support a unity government with the ruling </p><p>party, Mudzingwa did not clarify adequately.  (Note: It is </p><p>possible the MDC is still working out language / policy on </p><p>this.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) It is not yet clear whether the MDC really plans to </p><p>put forward a roadmap to peace with any reasonable level of </p><p>detail.  So far, their planned pitch to the POTUS delegation </p><p>remains uncertain.  However, we anticipate they will flesh </p><p>out the plan by July 4, and we would recommend consideration </p><p>of a meeting with AS Kansteiner.  We will report back on the </p><p>July 4 meeting, including any roadmap specifics that come up. </p><p> We did not find out from the MDC if they have informed South </p><p>Africans of their desire to meet with members of the POTUS </p><p>delegation, and this should be clarified.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
