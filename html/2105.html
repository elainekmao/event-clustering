(U) SUMMARY:  A WAVE OF CRITICISM HAS REPLACED THE </p><p>POSITIVE COMMENTARY HEARD IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCTOBER </p><p>18 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE UPC COALITION AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ALLEGE WIDESPREAD HARASSMENT AND </p><p>UNREASONABLE ARRESTS SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE </p><p>OFFICIAL ELECTION RESULTS AND CALL ELECTION AUTHORITIES </p><p>INEFFICIENT AND CORRUPT.  OTHER OPPOSITION PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS HAVE NOT BEEN TARGETED AS OF YET.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>UPC COALITION ACCUSES APRC OF HARASSMENT </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) WIDESPREAD AND FAIRLY CREDIBLE REPORTS INDICATE </p><p>THAT UPC SUPPORTERS AND THEIR HOMES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED </p><p>SINCE THE FINAL ELECTION RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED FRIDAY. </p><p>UNIFORMED POLICE AND ARMY HAVE ALLEGEDLY ARRESTED OVER </p><p>SIXTY KNOWN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS AND TAKEN THEM TO </p><p>POLICE STATIONS OR THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY </p><p>(NIA) HEADQUARTERS.  IN ADDITION, CIVILIAN MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE APRC, ALSO RUMORED TO BE MEMBERS OF THE RATHER MORE </p><p>SINISTER JULY 22 MOVEMENT, HAVE REPORTEDLY ASSAULTED </p><p>OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) SPECIFICALLY, UPC OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THAT APRC </p><p>MILITANTS ATTACKED THE HOMES OF THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE: </p><p>UDP ORGANIZING SECRETARY LAMIN WAA JUWARA, UDP </p><p>COALITION CAMPAIGN COORDINATOR FOR WESTERN DIVISION </p><p>ALHAJI DEMBO JATTA, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEMBO </p><p>BOJANG, AND OMAR JALLOW (OJ). </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) WELL-KNOWN DETAINEES INCLUDE DR. MOMODOU LAMIN </p><p>MANNEH, AN OPPOSITION SUPPORTER WHO RETURNED TO THE </p><p>GAMBIA TO CAMPAIGN AFTER BEING GRANTED ASYLUM IN THE </p><p>U.S., CITIZEN FM RADIO DIRECTOR GEORGE CHRISTENSEN AND </p><p>MUHAMMED LAMIN SILLAH, COORDINATOR OF THE COALITION OF </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF AMNESTY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL\'S GAMBIA CHAPTER.  THE THIRTEEN-YEAR OLD </p><p>BROTHER OF ONE OF POST\'S SECURITY LES STAFF WAS ALSO </p><p>TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT THE NIA DURING THE POLITICAL </p><p>CLASHES IN TALLINDING ON OCTOBER 16.  AS OF OCTOBER 24, </p><p>HE HAD NOT BEEN RELEASED AND HIS FAMILY HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>ALLOWED TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM.  POST WILL TRANSMIT AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL LIST OF DETAINEE NAMES SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ACCORDING TO UDP COALITION PARTY LEADERS, THEY </p><p>HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE </p><p>INTERIOR, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE, AND APRC </p><p>PARTY LEADERS, TO NO AVAIL.  THEY WOULD LIKE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OR THE APRC TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT ON </p><p>RADIO OR TELEVISION CONDEMNING HARASSMENT OF OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORTERS AND DIRECTING ALL APRC `MILITANTS\' TO </p><p>EXERCISE RESTRAINT UNDER THREAT OF PUNISHMENT.  THE </p><p>COALITION PARTY LEADERS STATE THEY HAVE RECEIVED NO </p><p>RESPONSE TO THEIR REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) COALITION LEADERS REPORT THAT THEIR MEMBERS ARE </p><p>GETTING RESTLESS AND FRUSTRATED, AND WITHOUT ACTION </p><p>FROM THE APRC OR GOVERNMENT, COALITION LEADERS CANNOT </p><p>GUARANTEE THEIR SUPPORTERS\' CONTINUED CALM.  MORE </p><p>OMINOUSLY, ONE COALITION REPRESENTATIVE SAID, "IF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SECURITY FORCES CANNOT PROTECT US, WE WILL </p><p>DEFEND OURSELVES." </p><p> </p><p>UDP COALITION CRITICIZES IEC ELECTION MANAGEMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) THE UDP COALITION HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 24, TO PUBLICIZE ITS ACCUSATIONS OF </p><p>APRC HARASSMENT, AND USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CRITICIZE </p><p>SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE ELECTION PROCESS, FROM </p><p>REGISTRATION ONWARD.  ONE REPORTER ASKED THE REASONABLE </p><p>QUESTION, "IF YOU OBJECTED TO HOW THE ELECTION WAS RUN, </p><p>WHY DID YOU RUSH TO CONGRATULATE THE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION BEFORE ALL OF THE </p><p>COUNTS WERE EVEN REPORTED?"  THE RESPONSE WAS A) "THE </p><p>GAMBIA IS LARGER THAN OUSAINOU DARBOE OR THE UDP," AND </p><p>DARBOE NEEDED TO EXERCISE LEADERSHIP AND ACCEPT THE </p><p>RESULTS TO ENSURE PEACE AND TRANQUILITY AFTER THE </p><p>ELECTIONS; AND B) THE COALITION BECAME AWARE OF MANY OF </p><p>THE ALLEGED ELECTION IRREGULARITIES ONLY IN THE DAYS </p><p>AFTER THE ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) COMMENT: THE POINT THAT DARBOE HAD TO ACCEPT THE </p><p>ELECTION RESULTS TO MAINTAIN PEACE IN THE GAMBIA IS </p><p>WELL-TAKEN; COALITION SUPPORTERS WERE ON-RECORD </p><p>DECLARING THAT THEY WOULD `FIGHT IN THE STREETS\' IF </p><p>THEIR CANDIDATE DID NOT WIN.  HOWEVER, IF THE COALITION </p><p>IS AS RESTLESS AND FRUSTRATED AS THEIR LEADERS </p><p>INDICATE, PUBLICLY LAMBASTING THE GOVERNMENT, THE APRC </p><p>AND ELECTION AUTHORITIES IS AS DANGEROUS AND </p><p>INFLAMMATORY NOW AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON ELECTION DAY. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) THE COALITION\'S STATEMENT AND PRESS RELEASE RE- </p><p>VISITED THE CONTROVERSIAL PROBLEM OF VOTERS WHO HAD </p><p>VOTER REGISTRATION CARDS BUT WERE NOT LISTED ON THE </p><p>COMPUTER PRINTOUT OF THE VOTER REGISTRATION LIST. </p><p>DARBOE LEVELED THE ACCUSATION THAT THE FINAL DECISION </p><p>TO ALLOW SUCH VOTERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION WAS </p><p>MADE BY INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION (IEC) CHAIR </p><p>GABRIEL ROBERTS AT THE BEHEST OF THE APRC AND WITHOUT </p><p>THE CONSENT OF THE REST OF THE IEC.  HE ALSO POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT ALTHOUGH THE VOTING PUBLIC HAD THE OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO OBJECT TO ANY NAME ON THE VOTER REGISTRATION LIST </p><p>THAT WAS PUBLISHED BEFORE THE ELECTIONS, THEY DID NOT </p><p>HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBJECT TO THE PEOPLE WHOSE </p><p>NAMES WERE ADDED WHEN THEY WERE ALLOWED TO VOTE ON </p><p>ELECTION DAY. DARBOE CHARGED THAT THE POLICY THUS </p><p>DENIED THE VOTING PUBLIC ONE OF THE RIGHTS GUARANTEED </p><p>UNDER THE ELECTION CODE OF CONDUCT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) IEC OFFICIAL SAID YUSUPH ADMITTED AT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THE ENTIRE VOTER </p><p>REGISTRATION PROCESS WAS CARRIED OUT HURRIEDLY IN A </p><p>SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, LEAVING SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY </p><p>FOR ERROR. MR. YUSUPH EXPLAINED THAT `YOUNG LADIES, </p><p>FRESH FROM SCHOOL, WHO MAYBE DID NOT APPRECIATE THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING\', ENTERED THE VOTER </p><p>REGISTRATION DATA INTO THE COMPUTER.  ACCORDING TO MR. </p><p>YUSUPH, ALTHOUGH THE IEC FOUND ERRORS IN THE DATABASE, </p><p>THEY DECIDED IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR TO DISENFRANCHISE </p><p>VOTERS WHO HAD LEGITIMATELY COMPLETED THE REGISTRATION </p><p>PROCESS ON THE BASIS OF DATA ENTRY ERRORS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) DARBOE FURTHER ALLEGED THAT THE ELECTORAL </p><p>PROCESS WAS CORRUPTED FROM THE BEGINNING BY THE VOTER </p><p>REGISTRATION PROCESS.  HE STATED THAT MANY NON-GAMBIANS </p><p>HAD OBTAINED NATIONAL ID CARDS AND USED THEM TO </p><p>REGISTER TO VOTE, AND THAT REGISTRATION HAD OCCURRED IN </p><p>SECRET OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICIAL REGISTRATION PERIOD AT </p><p>UNOFFICIAL PREMISES.  HE THEN PRODUCED THE SENEGALESE </p><p>NATIONAL ID CARD AND GAMBIAN VOTER REGISTRATION CARD OF </p><p>A MAN NAMED EBOU COLI, AND SAID IT WAS BUT ONE EXAMPLE </p><p>OF MANY.  HE CLAIMED THE IEC HAD NOT ACTED TO CORRECT </p><p>THE PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH THE OPPOSITION ALERTED THE IEC </p><p>TO THE CASE OF EBOU COLI AND MANY OTHERS BEFORE THE </p><p>ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) COMMENT: WHILE SOME IMPERFECTIONS, </p><p>IRREGULARITIES, AND EVEN INTENTIONAL MANIPULATION OF </p><p>THE ELECTORAL PROCESS WERE INEVITABLE, THE NEWS OF </p><p>ASSAULTS AND ARRESTS IS ALARMING.  THE APRC HAS WON THE </p><p>ELECTIONS, AND PRESUMABLY HAS NO MORE NEED TO </p><p>INTIMIDATE COALITION SUPPORTERS.  THE TARGETING OF THE </p><p>UDP COALITION AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS FOR THESE </p><p>ASSAULTS AND ARRESTS UNDERLINES THE RETALIATORY NATURE </p><p>OF THE APRC/GOVERNMENT ACTIONS.  THIS UNABASHED AND (SO </p><p>FAR) UNCHECKED ABUSE OF POWER HINTS AT THE SENSE OF </p><p>IMPUNITY FELT BY LOYALISTS UNDER THE APRC UMBRELLA. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TITUS </p><p></p></div>
