<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006581 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E STAFF - LISA COEN </p><p>STATE FOR EB/CBA - MERMOUD AND NEA/PPD - BOURGEOIS </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>STATE PASS USPTO FOR JOELLEN URBAN </p><p>CUSTOMS FOR FARAH NAIM AND CRAIG WALKER </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p>OPIC FOR JIM HANSLEY AND ABED TARBUSH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, KPAO, JO, OPIC </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S JOINT COMMISSION AGENDA </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6517 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Summary:  Jordan\'s government and private sector </p><p>have developed an ambitious schedule of events in support of </p><p>the December 11 U.S.-Jordan FTA Joint Commission meeting </p><p>(detailed schedule below).  Their plan envisages three days </p><p>of FTA-related meetings and press events to raise awareness </p><p>of the FTA among a broader U.S. audience.  Jordanian </p><p>Ambassador to the U.S. Karim Kawar will be a central </p><p>organizing point for the Jordanians and is likely to contact </p><p>addressees to begin organizing many of these events.  We will </p><p>continue to support JC preparations as we count down to </p><p>December 11.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Following is an outline of the GOJ\'s and the </p><p>Jordanian private sector\'s proposals for the Joint Commission </p><p>and related events.  We have tried to highlight areas of </p><p>Washington agency interest/assistance, and we will be happy </p><p>to help coordinate these events as well.  Please note that, </p><p>prior to the JC events, the private sector delegation will </p><p>have been participating in a USAID-funded study tour </p><p>targeting capacity-building for Jordanian trade associations. </p><p> Stops in the study tour prior to the JC include a meeting </p><p>with the Economic Club of Detroit, at which Jordanian Trade </p><p>Minister Salah al Bashir is slated to give an address. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Begin Washington Agenda: </p><p> </p><p>Wednesday, December 11 (OFFICIAL JC DATE AS PROPOSED BY MoIT) </p><p> </p><p>0900 - Digital video conference.  The technical details of </p><p>the conference are being handled by the Jordan Investment </p><p>Board (Lama Mahadeen, email: lama(at)jib.com.jo).  The DVC </p><p>will link Amman with Washington and five regional Arab </p><p>capitals.  The DVC concept is to start with introductory </p><p>remarks by King Abdullah, followed by brief remarks by USTR </p><p>Zoellick and Minister Bashir, followed by three pre-scripted </p><p>questions from remote participants, which either Zoellick or </p><p>Bashir will answer.  Total time for the event would be about </p><p>30 minutes. FOLLOW-UP ACTION REQUIRED:  We need confirmation </p><p>that a DVC facility will be reserved for that day/time, and </p><p>we need to get the DVC technical team in Washington in </p><p>contact with Mahadeen in Amman. </p><p> </p><p>0930-1230 - Joint Commission Senior-Level Meeting.  We have </p><p>been promised a detailed agenda by the GOJ by the end of the </p><p>week, which we will forward to Washington soonest.  We expect </p><p>this meeting to end with a press event.  Bashir has suggested </p><p>that the press event could include announcements by PhRMA and </p><p>Albemarle about their activities in Jordan.  Albemarle has </p><p>recently begun exporting bromine from its Dead Sea facility, </p><p>and is looking for a public forum to announce the </p><p>development, while PhRMA reps informed the Ambassador in </p><p>October that several member companies are ready to announce </p><p>new cooperative ventures with Jordanian partners.  In </p><p>addition to this, we expect there will be some sort of joint </p><p>statement issued by USTR and the Jordanian delegation </p><p>following the JC talks.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION REQUIRED: </p><p>Ambassador Kawar should be in contact soon with USTR staff to </p><p>work out the press event.  We will forward the GOJ\'s agenda </p><p>and official delegation list as soon as we receive them.  If </p><p>there will be a joint statement, we should be prepared to </p><p>share a draft with Bashir soonest. </p><p> </p><p>1230-1430 - Lunch co-hosted by JABA (Jordan\'s local Amcham) </p><p>and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (tentative).  JABA is trying </p><p>to schedule this lunch, but has received a lukewarm response </p><p>from the Chamber due to the Chamber\'s sensitivity over labor </p><p>and environmental provisions of the FTA and their impact on </p><p>new FTA\'s.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION:  We suggest that State </p><p>coordinate with the U.S. Chamber to secure agreement to hold </p><p>the lunch.  A senior USG official (tbd) is likely to be asked </p><p>by the U.S. Chamber to make remarks. </p><p> </p><p>1430-1730 - Joint Commission technical-level meetings.  The </p><p>GOJ has indicated an interest in conducting working-level </p><p>discussions on (at least) rules of origin and environmental </p><p>issues as provided for in the FTA text and side letters. </p><p>FOLLOW-UP ACTION REQUIRED:  We will forward the GOJ\'s </p><p>delegation list and proposed agenda as soon as we receive it, </p><p>and will coordinate meetings with GOJ counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>December 11 Afternoon (time tbd) - Globe Trade Event at </p><p>Jordanian Embassy.  This is primarily a match-making event </p><p>for the private sector, organized by the Jordanian Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>Thursday, December 12 </p><p> </p><p>0900-1100 - DoC-hosted roundtable for Jordanian trade </p><p>associations and U.S. counterparts.  We have forwarded a </p><p>concept paper to DoC to begin thinking on organizing such an </p><p>event, which would focus on FTA awareness-raising, </p><p>association-level matchmaking, and promotion of the </p><p>American-Jordanian Exhibition slated for March 2003.  The GOJ </p><p>expressed hope Secretary Evans would have time to briefly </p><p>address the roundtable alongside Minister Bashir.  There </p><p>would also be a public statement following the event, </p><p>optimally to announce the creation of a U.S. counterpart to </p><p>the Jordanian FTA coordinating committee ("TIJARA"), which is </p><p>comprised of interested Jordanian trade and professional </p><p>associations.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION REQUIRED: Once we have </p><p>received the Jordanian delegation list, we will work with DoC </p><p>to identify appropriate U.S. association counterparts and </p><p>encourage their participation. </p><p> </p><p>Lunchtime - Minister Bashir address to National Press Club </p><p>(tentative) - Bashir has expressed interest in addressing the </p><p>Club.  Ambassador Kawar should follow up from the Jordanian </p><p>embassy to coordinate this event. </p><p> </p><p>Additional events:  Bashir is seeking meetings with OPIC, </p><p>USDA, and Treasury, probably to discuss project finance, food </p><p>aid, and bilateral tax treaties, respectively.  OPIC, USDA </p><p>and Treasury should expect calls from Ambassador Kawar to </p><p>arrange those meetings, likely on the 12th.  We have conveyed </p><p>to Bashir the complexities of starting negotiations on a tax </p><p>treaty, and expect him to name a legal expert to the </p><p>delegation for that purpose. </p><p> </p><p>Friday, December 13 </p><p> </p><p>Breakfast co-hosted by the World Trade Centers (WTC), the </p><p>National U.S.-Arab Chambers of Commerce (NUSACC), and the </p><p>National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC).  This event is being </p><p>coordinated through the Amman World Trade Center and the </p><p>Jordanian embassy in Washington.  USG officials will likely </p><p>be invited. </p><p> </p><p>1000-1215 - QIZ event hosted by Dept of State (tentative). </p><p>Per Ref A, a group of QIZ managers, investors, and GOJ </p><p>officials, including Bashir, are interested in holding a QIZ </p><p>event to jump-start investment and allay retailer concerns </p><p>about political risk factors in Jordan.  The group hopes to </p><p>secure the participation of U/S Larson in this event. </p><p>FOLLOW-UP ACTION REQUIRED:  State to coordinate event with </p><p>help from Embassy Amman. </p><p> </p><p>Afternoon - JABA-led "door knock" on Capitol Hill </p><p>(tentative).  This will be coordinated by JABA and the </p><p>Jordanian embassy in Washington.  We will also pass to State </p><p>a list of Hill leaders the delegation would like to meet once </p><p>we receive it.   Please note Bashir has expressed interest in </p><p>attending the door knock. </p><p> </p><p>End agenda. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Press plan:  Embassy is preparing a press plan for </p><p>the lead-up to the JC, JC-related events, and follow-up press </p><p>coverage in Jordan.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION REQUIRED:  The JC is an </p><p>excellent opportunity to highlight Jordan as a successful </p><p>example of USG trade policy.  We recommend PA officers from </p><p>interested Washington agencies coordinate with the Jordanian </p><p>embassy press office to ensure adequate coverage of the JC. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
