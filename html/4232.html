<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006535 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ISLAMIST ABU SAYYAF POSES CHALLENGE TO GOJ IN MA\'AN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 341 B. FBIS GMP20021031000084 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ ENCOUNTERS TROUBLE IN MA\'AN...AGAIN </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Jordanian Security Forces are currently engaged in a </p><p>tense standoff with Islamist activist Mohammad Shalibi aka </p><p>Abu Sayyaf, which started when the PSD attempted to take Abu </p><p>Sayyaf into custody on October 29, at a road block on the </p><p>Desert Highway near Ma\'an in Southern Jordan.  Abu Sayyaf </p><p>(accused of being the local leader of the rejectionist </p><p>Islamic group takfir wa hijra) has been wanted by the </p><p>Jordanian authorities for his involvement in stirring up </p><p>protests in Ma\'an--a city with a history of  anti-government </p><p>unrest--after a January incident involving the death of a </p><p>local boy in police custody (see ref A).  Abu Sayyaf resisted </p><p>arrest and a firefight ensued in which Abu Sayyaf and two PSD </p><p>officers were injured.  PSD were unable to arrest Abu Sayyaf, </p><p>who escaped with the help of heavily armed local tribesmen </p><p>and he remains at large in the Ma\'an area.  According to RSO </p><p>contacts in the PSD, the PSD has no evidence linking Abu </p><p>Sayyaf with the Foley assasination and Abu Sayyaf has </p><p>publicly denied any connection to it (although he was quoted </p><p>in al-Quds al-Arabi as saying he was pleased with the </p><p>"operation"--Ref B).  The current situation poses a difficult </p><p>challenge of authority for the King in a city that has </p><p>periodically over the past two decades, seen similar tensions </p><p>erupt. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>KING PREPARED TO ACT WITH FORCE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  British Ambassador Prentice told the Ambassador </p><p>November 6 that he had raised the situation in Ma\'an during a </p><p>dinner conversation with King Abdullah on November 5.  The </p><p>King was well briefed on the situation, and understood the </p><p>actions and statements of Abu Sayyaf and his supporters to be </p><p>a direct challenge to government authority in the city.  The </p><p>King commented that his security officials had tried thus far </p><p>to deal with the Ma\'an situation with a "light approach" </p><p>given the interplay of tribal and religious factors.  "But </p><p>enough is enough," the King told Prentice.    Murderers and </p><p>those responsible for public disorder must be brought to </p><p>heel, he said. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  The King said he understood that Abu Sayyaf and his </p><p>men were well armed, including with rocket propelled grenades </p><p>(RPG\'s).  Possession of RPG\'s, the King commented, is </p><p>illegal, and if the government does not deal with the </p><p>situation, it will only get worse.  The King told Prentice </p><p>that he had ordered security agencies to give Abu Sayyaf </p><p>forty eight hours to surrender himself to the police.  If he </p><p>did not, the King said, he had ordered the security forces to </p><p>resolve the standoff with force. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Ma\'an -- an economically depressed area with strong </p><p>tribal views and a significant presence of Salafi and Takfiri </p><p>adherents -- has long been a center of opposition to the </p><p>government.  Over the past twenty years, Ma\'an has been the </p><p>scene of unrest and rioting over bread and gasoline price </p><p>increases.  We have been watching the current difficulties </p><p>brew over the past week, and believe they may soon reach a </p><p>crisis point. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  That said, we do not see any popular reverberation </p><p>of recent events in Ma\'an in other areas of Jordan, nor do we </p><p>feel a groundswell of similar anti-government feeling in </p><p>other population centers.  Nor should we connect these events </p><p>to the tragic murder of USAID Officer Larry Foley (although </p><p>some in the press have done so, and may again).  In the end, </p><p>these latest troubles in Ma\'an are a serious, but local, </p><p>challenge to government authority from a town that has </p><p>periodically challenged the government in the past. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
