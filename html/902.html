THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF AMCITS ON </p><p>BOARD.  BY LATE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 9, THE </p><p>SHIP\'S ENGINE ROOM WAS REPORTEDLY ON FIRE AND </p><p>THE SHIP IN DANGER OF SINKING.  SRI LANKAN </p><p>NAVY PERSONNEL WERE ATTEMPTING TO EXTINGUISH </p><p>THE FIRE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE M/V CORDIALITY IS REPORTEDLY </p><p>OWNED BY THE CHINA OCEAN SHIPPING COMPANY, A </p><p>CHINESE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE; IT WAS </p><p>REGISTERED IN PANAMA AND FLYING A PANAMANIAN </p><p>FLAG.

END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SMYTH </p><p></p><p></p></div>
