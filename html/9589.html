<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 002091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MANLEY DROPS OUT OF </p><p>LEADERSHIP RACE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) John Manley, Canada\'s Deputy Prime Minister and </p><p>Finance Minister, withdrew from the Liberal Party leadership </p><p>race on July 22, saying that Paul Martin\'s lead is </p><p>insurmountable.  Manley said that his campaign reviewed party </p><p>membership lists over the weekend, and determined that it </p><p>would not have been supported by more than 15-20% of the </p><p>delegates at party caucus meetings in September.  He endorsed </p><p>Paul Martin\'s candidacy, saying that Martin will make an </p><p>excellent Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Manley said that his campaign had accomplished its </p><p>mission of putting out his message and ensuring healthy </p><p>debate in the leadership race.  He told reporters that the </p><p>"numbers aren\'t there for me this time," an indication that </p><p>he plans to seek the leadership again in the future.  The </p><p>only other candidate still in the race now is Heritage </p><p>Minister Sheila Copps, who has a small core of supporters in </p><p>the left wing of the party. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Paul Martin is expected to win an overwhelming </p><p>majority of delegates to the party leadership convention in </p><p>November, and to take over as Prime Minister some time </p><p>between then and February.  Prime Minister Chretien\'s staff </p><p>maintains that he will not be stepping down until February, </p><p>but he could decide to leave earlier - perhaps after the </p><p>December 5-8 Commonwealth Summit in Nigeria.  Martin is </p><p>expected to seek his own mandate from the voters by calling a </p><p>national election in Spring 2004. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Given the weakness of the opposition parties, </p><p>the Liberals - Canada\'s only party that is truly competitive </p><p>nation-wide at this point - are expected to win again in </p><p>2004.  Despite Manley\'s strong performance in the Chretien </p><p>Cabinet, including his oversight of U.S.-Canada border </p><p>issues, his candidacy for the party leadership was a long </p><p>shot from the start.  Martin, who served as Chretien\'s </p><p>Finance Minister from 1993 until 2002, had a huge advantage </p><p>in organization and funding, while Manley had little grass </p><p>roots support outside of Ottawa.  Manley also had a difficult </p><p>time differentiating himself from Martin; both are party </p><p>centrists who want to keep the budget balanced and improve </p><p>relations with the U.S. after the strains caused over Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT CONT\'D:  It is unclear if Martin will keep </p><p>Manley on in a new government.  Manley certainly would not </p><p>remain as Deputy Prime Minister, nor would he have the vast </p><p>portfolio he has held over the past year under Chretien.  But </p><p>his early withdrawal from the race and endorsement of Martin </p><p>increases his chances of being kept on in some capacity. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
