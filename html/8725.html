(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) The Ambassador told MFA Minstate Hamdan </p><p>bin Zayid June 10 that the authorities in Dubai </p><p>had confirmed that the 43.5 million USD in illicit </p><p>Iraqi missile money had been released by the Dubai </p><p>court several months previously and returned to </p><p>the majority Emirati owned Wasl and Babel company. </p><p>We now needed the assistance of the UAEG to </p><p>examine the financial records of Wasl and Babel to </p><p>determine whether these funds were still in the </p><p>UAE banking system.  If so, the monies should be </p><p>frozen since they represent illicit assets of the </p><p>previous Iraqi regime.  If the funds have been </p><p>transferred elsewhere, we would appreciate access </p><p>to account records and other information which </p><p>might assist us in identifying the destination of </p><p>the 43.5 million usd, and possibly other illicit </p><p>transactions by the former Iraqi regime. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) Shaykh Hamdan indicated that he fully </p><p>understood the importance of following up on this </p><p>matter and said he would request the information </p><p>from the Central Bank and pass it to us through </p><p>liaison to ORCA. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
