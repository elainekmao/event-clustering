<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000704 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: DENYING ALLEGED USG-PKK </p><p>CONTACTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 23898 B. ANKARA 0618 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Jan. 28 we delivered ref (A) talking points to MFA DDG </p><p>for Counterterrorism Kemal Asya.  Asya replied that, in </p><p>response to our ref (B) protest over the recent press </p><p>campaign accusing the U.S. of cooperating with the PKK, MFA </p><p>had submitted a request to the Turkish General Staff </p><p>requesting the TGS file alleged to contain USG-PKK contacts. </p><p>TGS had not yet responded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Asya opened further that (a) this campaign should not </p><p>affect bilateral relations and (b) perhaps there have been </p><p>official USG contacts with the PKK anyway, contacts which it </p><p>would be natural for a global power to have.  We rejoined </p><p>that Washington remains dismayed at lingering anti-U.S. </p><p>suspicions in certain Turkish agencies and that we have no </p><p>interest in contacts with PKK/KADEK since their nature as </p><p>terrorist organizations remains unchanged. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
