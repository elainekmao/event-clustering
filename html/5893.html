<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 001157 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR SAUMS </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>TREASURY FOR MILLS, CHANG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN STALLS ON BIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01/28/03 SVAT/ROGERS TELCON </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: FM Muasher told the Ambassador that he </p><p>wants a three month delay in the Exchange of Instruments of </p><p>Ratification that would bring the Bilateral Investment Treaty </p><p>(BIT) into force in order to allow the government time to </p><p>assess the Treaty\'s impact on a pending investment dispute </p><p>with an Italian firm.  Further delay in the Exchange will </p><p>send a bad message to investors at a critical time for </p><p>Jordan, particularly given the role FDI could play in </p><p>mitigating the long-term economic impact of a military </p><p>conflict with Iraq.  Following up on his discussions in </p><p>Jordan in October, we recommend U/S Larson raise this concern </p><p>with the Jordanian Trade and Foreign Ministers.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>NOW YOU SEE IT; NOW YOU DON\'T </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In a meeting with the Ambassador January 19, FM </p><p>Muasher said Jordan would like a three month delay in the </p><p>Exchange of Instruments of Ratification that would bring the </p><p>BIT into force.  Muasher said MFA and outside lawyers advised </p><p>him to postpone the Exchange pending resolution of an </p><p>International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes </p><p>(ICSID) case brought against Jordan by two Italian companies </p><p>due to fears that the companies could take advantage of Most </p><p>Favored Nation (MFN) status under the Jordan-Italy BIT once </p><p>the U.S. BIT enters into force.  Muasher suggested that </p><p>Jordanian and U.S. lawyers get together to resolve the </p><p>question of the U.S. BIT\'s applicability. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) MFA Legal Affairs Director Naber called Econoff </p><p>February 20 to elaborate on the reasons for the Minister\'s </p><p>delay.  He said the counsel for the GOJ, Imam Odeh of the </p><p>Sheif Ali Zoubi law firm, sent a letter to Minister of Water </p><p>and Irrigation (MWI) Nasser suggesting that he request, via </p><p>the MFA, a three month delay in the entry into force of the </p><p>BIT.  He suggested that this could enhance the Ministry\'s </p><p>legal position regarding an ICSID complaint filed by the two </p><p>Italian companies against the MWI.  Odeh argued that the </p><p>delay was desirable because the companies were currently </p><p>submitting the facts of the case to ICSID under the Italian </p><p>BIT, which permits ICSID intervention only as a method of </p><p>last resort.  He said he was concerned that an entry into </p><p>force of the American BIT at this time would enable them to </p><p>use MFN status to more readily access the ICSID mechanism via </p><p>the American BIT.  Once the facts of the case are presented, </p><p>the case is "locked", according to Odeh, and the companies </p><p>would be unable to invoke the American BIT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Naber was at pains to stress that this was not an </p><p>open-ended matter, and that the MFA fully expected the issue </p><p>to be resolved soon and the entry into force to proceed.  He </p><p>said, "It is not our intention to delay putting into place </p><p>the last big piece of the jigsaw we have put together,"  but </p><p>added that "for a small economy like ours, $28 million (the </p><p>amount claimed by the Italians) is a lot of money."  Naber </p><p>added that he and other MFA advisors met with Odeh to "see if </p><p>there might be another way" and avoid this problem, but could </p><p>find none.  He said that he, and Odeh, were open to </p><p>discussing their concerns with lawyers from the Department. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>THE ITALIAN CONNECTION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The dispute with the MWI was brought to ICSID by </p><p>Italian construction companies Salini Construtorri and </p><p>Italstrade against the Jordanian government in November, 2002 </p><p>under the terms of the Jordan-Italy BIT.  However, in a </p><p>discussion with Italian Embassy Econoff Nicola Lener, we </p><p>learned the Italian companies plan to use most favored nation </p><p>treatment accorded to it by the Italian BIT to gain access to </p><p>the ICSID mechanism once our BIT is in force.  (ICSID is a </p><p>measure of last resort in the Italian BIT, but available to </p><p>investors at any point under the U.S. treaty.)  Lener </p><p>confirmed that the company is strictly Italian, with no </p><p>American connection or investors.  He said the complaint </p><p>centers on cost overruns allegedly incurred by the companies </p><p>in the construction of the Karameh dam project in the mid-90s </p><p>for which they have not been reimbursed. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Naber had brought the Italian case to our attention </p><p>in mid-January, upon receiving our diplomatic note proposing </p><p>minor technical changes to the Jordanian-Arabic text of the </p><p>BIT (changes that were agreed to by both parties in direct </p><p>discussions in December in Washington).  Post then consulted </p><p>with L and EB (REFTELCON) and were advised that BIT </p><p>provisions only apply after entry into force, thirty days </p><p>after the Exchange of Instruments of Ratification.  We passed </p><p>this information along to Naber late January, who expressed </p><p>appreciation, and assured us an MFA response to the Dip Note </p><p>would soon be forthcoming and that we could soon proceed on </p><p>setting up a ceremony for the Exchange.  As recently as </p><p>February 17, a Jordan Investment Board (JIB) official told us </p><p>she was expecting the draft copy of the response to our Dip </p><p>Note from the MFA. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  We expect that regime change in Iraq will </p><p>considerably improve Jordan\'s attractiveness as a destination </p><p>for foreign investment.  The combination of greater regional </p><p>stability and the preferential access Jordan enjoys to the </p><p>U.S. and European markets would put Jordan in a unique </p><p>position to stand out in the region as an FDI recipient. </p><p>Indeed, an increase in FDI flows could well be an important </p><p>factor in helping Jordan adjust over time to the loss of its </p><p>special oil relationship with Iraq and otherwise offset the </p><p>negative economic impact on Jordan of a military conflict. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Given the role FDI could play, the idea that </p><p>Jordan would not allow an investment treaty to enter into </p><p>force because there is a chance its provisions might actually </p><p>be used in a particular case is shortsighted.  In addition to </p><p>a BIT being an important asset in attracting foreign </p><p>investment, potential foreign investors are likely to look </p><p>especially poorly on legalistic maneuvers like the one </p><p>proposed by Muasher in order to avoid obligations to </p><p>investors.  (In fact, the GOJ has already argued that a case </p><p>brought to ICSID by the U.S.-U.K. company Jacobs Engineering </p><p>under the UK BIT is not valid because the UK BIT was not </p><p>properly ratified.  This assertion was quickly disproved by </p><p>the UK embassy.)  Furthermore, we note that an investment </p><p>chapter was not included in the U.S.-Jordan FTA on the </p><p>expectation that the BIT would provide sufficient protections. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Post will vigorously pursue this issue with </p><p>Muasher and senior ministers responsible for economic </p><p>matters.  Even though the question of the BIT\'s applicability </p><p>to the Italian case should not bear on the GOJ\'s policy </p><p>making, we would also be happy to facilitate contacts between </p><p>USG and Jordanian lawyers if the Department thinks it would </p><p>be useful.  In addition, we think it could be helpful for U/S </p><p>Larson to include this issue in his discussions with </p><p>Jordanian officials on the impact on Jordan of a conflict. </p><p>Letters from U/S Larson to Muasher and to Industry and Trade </p><p>Minister Salah al-Bashir along the lines of the text </p><p>suggested below would reinforce the high-level USG economic </p><p>interest in seeing this treaty in force without further </p><p>delay. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Begin text of proposed draft letter. </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Minister: </p><p> </p><p>A theme of my meetings with you and other Jordanian officials </p><p>and the business sector in Amman last October was the </p><p>economic potential Jordan enjoys given its outstanding record </p><p>of economic reform and the preferential access it enjoys to </p><p>the U.S., EU and other markets.  Jordan\'s attractiveness as a </p><p>destination for foreign direct investment will be a key </p><p>ingredient of its capacity to mitigate the economic impact of </p><p>disruptions in the region and to achieve its full economic </p><p>potential. </p><p> </p><p>Because of the central role foreign direct investment plays </p><p>in economic growth and development, I am concerned that the </p><p>United States and Jordan have not been able to bring into </p><p>force the Bilateral Investment Treaty that was signed in 1997 </p><p>and ratified by the Jordanian Parliament in 1998 and the U.S. </p><p>Senate in 2000.  Since U.S. and foreign investors look to the </p><p>assurances provided by such treaties when making investment </p><p>decisions, I hope that we can bring this agreement into </p><p>effect without further delay.  I understand that once a few </p><p>technical adjustments have been made to the Arabic text, </p><p>Ambassador Gnehm is prepared to exchange instruments of </p><p>ratification with Jordan\'s designated official. </p><p>I look forward to hearing from you about this important </p><p>issue.  With this key complement to our Free Trade Agreement </p><p>in place, I believe that we will have created a legal </p><p>structure that will allow the economic relationship between </p><p>the United States and Jordan to continue to grow and flourish. </p><p> </p><p>End Text </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
