<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000484 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI TRIAL: BEN-MENASHE STILL UNDER CROSS </p><p>EXAMINATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 360 </p><p> </p><p>     B. HARARE 313 </p><p>     C. HARARE 259 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER KIMBERLY JEMISON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) A </p><p>ND (D) </p><p> </p><p>Summary.  1.  (C) The treason trial of Movement for </p><p>Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC) officials Morgan Tsvangirai, Welshman Ncube, and Renson </p><p>Gasela resumed on March 3, after a one-week recess. </p><p>Cross-examination of the state,s star witness, Ari </p><p>Ben-Menashe, entered its seventeenth day on March 7.  Court </p><p>time was divided between questioning Ben-Menashe about </p><p>portions of the infamous videotape and dealing with </p><p>Ben-Menashe,s conduct.  The judge and the lawyers were </p><p>visibly tired of Ben-Menashe and the slow pace of the trial, </p><p>and the judge even met with the attorneys on more than one </p><p>occasion to discuss ways to speed it up.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Bizos Picks Apart Videotape </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Lead defense attorney George Bizos resumed his </p><p>cross-examination on March 3, after a one-week recess granted </p><p>at the behest of Ari Ben-Menashe.  Bizos, questioning </p><p>focused on pointing out irregularities between Ben-Menashe,s </p><p>testimony and the videotape and on showing the court how </p><p>Ben-Menashe and his associates tried to entrap Tsvangirai, </p><p>Ncube, and Gasela.   Bizos made it very clear that Tsvangirai </p><p>used the word "eliminate" only once, and only after ABM had </p><p>used it over and over again. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Bizos asked Ben-Menashe to decipher the conversation </p><p>between him, his business partner Alexander Legault, and </p><p>purported CIA Deputy Director Simms when Tsvangirai and </p><p>Johnson left the room at one point during their December 2001 </p><p>meeting in Montreal.  Bizos also questioned Ben-Menashe about </p><p>passages in which Ben-Menashe pretended to be on </p><p>Tsvangirai,s side for the purposes of entrapment. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Ben-Menashe reiterated previous claims that Tsvangirai had </p><p>wanted Dickens and Madson to secure the CIA\'s help in </p><p>assassinating Mugabe.  He also claimed that, for the first </p><p>time during the trial and without any corroboration from the </p><p>videotape, Tsvangirai also planned to kill some of Mugabe\'s </p><p>ministers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ben-Menashe Wasting Court,s Time </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The court has spent an inordinate amount of time </p><p>arguing over Ben-Menashe,s compliance with court orders and </p><p>dealing with his over-the-top behavior. Before the recess, </p><p>Ben-Menashe was ordered to produce several documents </p><p>including a certificate of registration and financial data </p><p>for Dickens and Madsen (see reftel A).  On March 3, Bizos </p><p>questioned Ben-Menashe about these documents and pressed the </p><p>court to find Ben-Menashe in noncompliance of the court order </p><p>to produce these items.  On the morning of March 4, Presiding </p><p>Judge Paddington Garwe deliberated for more than an hour on </p><p>whether the documents Ben-Menashe provided complied with the </p><p>court order.  At the end of the deliberations, Garwe decided </p><p>Ben-Menashe should explain what was produced and why some </p><p>things were missing.  During the afternoon, Bizos argued once </p><p>more how Ben-Menashe was not in compliance. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Court proceedings were held up several times because </p><p>of Ben-Menashe,s conduct.  On the afternoon of March 5, </p><p>court adjourned half an hour early (before 16h00) as a result </p><p>of Ben-Menashe,s comments about Morgan Tsvangirai.  During </p><p>the cross-examination, Ben-Menashe insulted Tsvangirai by </p><p>saying "The future president of Zimbabwe is nuts."  Bizos </p><p>told the court that he would sit down until the court </p><p>addressed the matter.  Garwe cautioned Ben-Menashe to watch </p><p>his language, reminding him that they had been through this </p><p>before.  Ben-Menashe then apologized, after which Bizos asked </p><p>if the apology were extended to his client.  Ben-Menashe </p><p>replied no and Bizos insisted that an apology be extended to </p><p>his client forthwith.  Garwe looked at his watch and declared </p><p>that court would adjourn until the following morning. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The March 6 morning session opened with Garwe </p><p>strongly castigating Ben-Menashe.  He made the following </p><p>points: </p><p> </p><p>--despite numerous warnings, the state\'s witness continues to </p><p>use inappropriate and insulting language; </p><p>--in a court of law virtually everywhere in the world, </p><p>certain rules of decorum must be observed; </p><p>--lawyers are expected to behave according to the ethics of </p><p>their profession; </p><p>--when a witness derides the accused, it is not acceptable </p><p>and contemptuous of the proceedings; </p><p>--I hope this final warning will suffice and be taken </p><p>seriously. </p><p>Despite this castigation, Garwe had to instruct Ben-Menashe </p><p>during the afternoon session on March 6 not to call the </p><p>accused criminals but to refer to them as the accused. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Court was held up again for half an hour during the </p><p>afternoon session on March 6 when Ben-Menashe asked the judge </p><p>to dismiss him from the stand and allow him to return to </p><p>Canada, claiming abuse from both the defense and the state. </p><p>Ben-Menashe argued that the state had a vested interest in </p><p>his being on the stand and that the defense was trying to win </p><p>through a technicality and that was why he had been </p><p>questioned for several weeks.  Ben-Menashe also complained </p><p>about having to answer questions repeatedly and accused the </p><p>defense of prolonging the trial. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Bizos emphatically rejected the suggestion that he </p><p>was responsible for the protracted trial and cited examples </p><p>where catering to Ben-Menashe had delayed the proceedings. </p><p>Deputy Attorney General Patel also rejected the suggestion </p><p>that he was trying to drag the trial out, citing examples </p><p>when he had objected to the defense,s line of questioning. </p><p>Garwe said he would make a ruling on the petition March 7, </p><p>but that Ben-Menashe would testify through the day. </p><p> </p><p>Interest Dwindling and Patience Thin </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>9. (U) The week saw a marked decrease in the number of </p><p>visitors in the courtroom.  The lower gallery was between </p><p>half and three quarters full.  The upper gallery was </p><p>relatively empty before the recess.  The press area has been </p><p>partially full with at least two-thirds occupancy.  In </p><p>addition to dwindling interest, the two weeks of rain and </p><p>exasperation with Ben-Menashe could also factor into the </p><p>reduced participation. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Garwe is clearly getting fed up with Ben-Menashe (and </p><p>the slow pace of the trial), but still stopped short of </p><p>spelling out the consequences of inappropriate behavior.  He </p><p>has tried to speed up the trial by discussing--so far, </p><p>without success--ways to do so with opposing attorneys in </p><p>chambers. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The judge and lawyers are visibly tired of dealing </p><p>with Ben-Menashe and the slow pace of the trial.  Both Bizos </p><p>and Patel sigh loudly and show other signs of exasperation </p><p>when Ben-Menashe goes off on a tangent, as he does in his </p><p>responses to virtually every question.  Earlier in the week, </p><p>defense counsel thought they would have completed the </p><p>cross-examination by March 5 but given the constant </p><p>interruptions and lack of cooperation by Ben-Menashe and </p><p>Garwe,s lack of control over the witness, the </p><p>cross-examination could go on for another week.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
