(C) SUMMARY:  Father Harry Miller (AMCIT -- strictly </p><p>protect), a Catholic priest and resident of Sri Lanka </p><p>for almost 55 years, is changing his tune on the human </p><p>rights situation in Sri Lanka.  Prior to the start of </p><p>the peace process in December 2001, Miller was for many </p><p>years harshly critical of the GSL\'s human rights record. </p><p>More recently, however, Miller has become worried about </p><p>the Tamil Tigers and its nefarious activities, including </p><p>the forcible recruitment of children.  Miller\'s shift in </p><p>emphasis places a spotlight on a larger trend we are </p><p>seeing among human rights activists -- and many Tamils, </p><p>who are increasingly worried about the LTTE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ABOUT THE FATHER:  Father Harry Miller, 77, is </p><p>a Catholic priest who has lived in Batticaloa in eastern </p><p>Sri Lanka, since leaving his Jesuit seminary in New </p><p>Orleans in 1948, the year of Sri Lanka\'s independence. </p><p>For years, Miller served as a teacher and administrator </p><p>at St. Michael\'s School in Batticaloa town, a </p><p>prestigious local elementary-to-high school.  In </p><p>addition, he managed a coconut farm located just outside </p><p>Batticaloa town, which is part of the Jesuit Mission to </p><p>Sri Lanka and helps support Roman Catholic academic </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Through the years as ethnic tensions in Sri </p><p>Lanka flared into confrontation and violence, Miller </p><p>became increasingly involved in human rights issues.  In </p><p>1983, he helped form the Batticaloa Peace Committee, a </p><p>local human rights organization.  More recently, Miller </p><p>became a local representative for the Norwegian-run Sri </p><p>Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), which is charged with </p><p>monitoring adherence to the February 2001 ceasefire </p><p>accord between the Sri Lankan government and the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  Due to his </p><p>length of service in Batticaloa and the multiple </p><p>organizations he remains involved in, Miller is a well- </p><p>regarded local fixture in the east, and a consistently </p><p>well-informed interlocutor for diplomats and the </p><p>international press. (Note:  Aside from his comments re </p><p>human rights and local politics, he will also tell you </p><p>entertaining family stories about the "Yankee" troops </p><p>entering Louisiana in the Civil War.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A LONG-TIME CRITIC OF THE GSL:  For years after </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s conflict began in 1983, Miller was extremely </p><p>critical of the government and its security forces. </p><p>(Note:  Miller was also highly critical of the Indian </p><p>Peace-keeping Force, "IPKF," which was deployed in Sri </p><p>Lanka from 1987 to 1990.  His opinions on IPKF-LTTE </p><p>fighting and the human rights fallout are widely quoted </p><p>in a well-known book on Sri Lanka called "Only Man is </p><p>Vile" by William McGowan.)  On countless occasions </p><p>through the years, he accused the security forces of </p><p>involvement in human rights violations in the war </p><p>against the LTTE.  In doing this, he has often publicly </p><p>contradicted the military\'s official statements about </p><p>incidents in the east.  An example of this was his </p><p>description of the May 17, 2000, "Vesak Day" (a Buddhist </p><p>holiday) bombing in Batticaloa that killed 18 people, </p><p>including 9 children.  The military investigation into </p><p>the incident found that all of the deaths were due to </p><p>the initial bomb blast, which was almost certainly set </p><p>by the LTTE.  Miller maintained, however, that the </p><p>children, and some of the adults, were killed when </p><p>security forces arrived and indiscriminately opened </p><p>fire. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In criticizing the government, Miller often made </p><p>clear his view that the way the GSL was fighting the </p><p>war, which included overlooking human rights violations </p><p>by its troops, was helping provoke Tamils to join the </p><p>LTTE.  That said, he was never an apologist for the </p><p>LTTE, and its use of violence and terrorism.  In myriad </p><p>conversations with emboffs, once he had finished </p><p>criticizing the security forces, Miller would lambaste </p><p>the LTTE.  At the same time, the overall trend of </p><p>Miller\'s comments -- and the lack of balance in the </p><p>passion with which those views were delivered -- almost </p><p>seemed to gloss over LTTE actions in favor of hitting </p><p>out at the government. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) A SHIFT:  With the advent of the peace process in </p><p>December 2001, Miller\'s steady diet of criticism for the </p><p>government has dramatically morphed into a focus on the </p><p>poor human rights record of the LTTE.  Per Reftels, in a </p><p>recent meeting with emboffs, Miller slammed the LTTE for </p><p>forcibly abducting children for its armed forces and for </p><p>placing burdensome taxes on civilians.  (Note:  On the </p><p>topic of forcible recruitment of children, Miller was </p><p>recently quoted in The New York Times as stating that </p><p>the LTTE "have thousands of children, and they\'re still </p><p>taking them.  We haven\'t gotten any back.")  He went on </p><p>to specifically complain about an incident in late 2002 </p><p>in which LTTE cadre forced St. Michaels\' schoolchildren </p><p>to work on one of the group\'s farms, noting that one of </p><p>the children died in a fall from a tractor.  He also </p><p>complained that the LTTE was seizing houses in the </p><p>Batticaloa area for use by its cadre, and that members </p><p>of the group were stealing coconuts from the farm he </p><p>manages and using the tractor there without permission. </p><p>He has also asserted that the Batticaloa Peace Committee </p><p>cannot do its work because of a complete lack of </p><p>cooperation from the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Although Miller has not said it explicitly, his </p><p>deeper concern seems to be that the LTTE is now running </p><p>amok in the east and little is being done to stop it. </p><p>At times, he even expresses concerns that the security </p><p>forces he once loathed seem to have thrown in the towel </p><p>by retreating into their garrisons.  While he does not </p><p>say it, perhaps because it is too sharp a departure from </p><p>his previous years of hitting out at the GSL, Miller </p><p>seems a man worried that the government in Colombo plans </p><p>to give up the east, leaving the LTTE in unfettered </p><p>charge. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  Miller\'s dramatic shift in perspective </p><p>places a spotlight on a larger trend we are seeing among </p><p>human rights activists -- and many Tamils.  While Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s security forces have a well-documented history </p><p>of human rights violations, it is the case that this </p><p>record gradually improved (largely thanks to </p><p>international pressure) as the government and judiciary </p><p>increased oversight, and the military provided better </p><p>training. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) With the focus on the government diminishing, </p><p>the LTTE is being recognized as the major human rights </p><p>violator in the country.  More generally, human rights </p><p>activists and many Tamils are newly aware that the north </p><p>and the east may well have to live with the LTTE being </p><p>the major political force in those areas for some time </p><p>to come.  This recognition is not a positive one, </p><p>creating a classic "be careful what you wish for because </p><p>it might come true" situation.  In essence, Miller and </p><p>those like him got what they want in that the government </p><p>has improved its record but, in the process, they are </p><p>now stuck with the LTTE, which is much, much less </p><p>amenable to change.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
