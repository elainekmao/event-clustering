<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 005257 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/FO - AMBASSADOR D. JOHNSON </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR NEA </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USAID </p><p>KABUL FOR AMBASSDOR TAYLOR </p><p>TREASURY FOR UNDER SECRETARY TAYLOR AND OASIA </p><p>MANILA FOR ADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, ECON, KU, AF </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHAN ASSISTANCE: KUWAIT PREPARED TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN ROAD PROJECT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 5018 </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) On December 2, post received a copy of a fax message </p><p>addressed to Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan Finance Minister, from </p><p>Hisham Al-Waqayan, Deputy Director General for Operations and </p><p>Disbursement at the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development </p><p>(KFAED).  The letter was a response to Ghani\'s letter of </p><p>November 17 urging Kuwait to consider funding the </p><p>Kandahar-Spin Boldak road project to fulfill the country\'s </p><p>commitment for project finance assistance.  A copy of the </p><p>letter was apparently also sent to the Asian Development Bank </p><p>headquarters in Manila. </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) The letter conveys to Ghani KFAED\'s "willingness, in </p><p>principle, to consider contributing towards co-financing the </p><p>above mentioned project."  The letter goes on to request </p><p>Ghani to "instruct the concerned authorities to despatch all </p><p>available economic, financial and technical feasibility </p><p>studies relating to the said project as soon as possible." </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) Comment:  It appears that the visit of Ambassadors </p><p>Taylor and Johnson (reftel) seems to have successfully walked </p><p>Kuwait back from its plan to donate two used 747\'s to </p><p>Afghanistan and shifted the government\'s focus onto the ring </p><p>road project.  We are also pleased to have been able to </p><p>facilitate communications between the Afghan and Kuwaiti </p><p>governments, and are prepared to carry on that role as long </p><p>as necessary.  End comment. </p><p>RJONES </p><p></p></div>
