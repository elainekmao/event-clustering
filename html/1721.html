<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BANJUL 000327 </p><p> </p><p>KINSHASA FOR D. TITUS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/16/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, LI, SN, GA </p><p>SUBJECT: THE GAMBIA -- JAMMEH\'S WEST AFRICA POLICY </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR GEORGE W. HALEY FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ALTHOUGH HE HAS NOT DEVELOPED A </p><p>COHERENT STRATEGY FOR WEST AFRICAN REGIONAL </p><p>SECURITY, PRESIDENT JAMMEH WANTS TO BE A MORE </p><p>VISIBLE PLAYER IN SUB-REGIONAL DIPLOMACY. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, JAMMEH IS KEEN ON DEVELOPING A </p><p>REPUTATION AS AN INFLUENTIAL PEACE BROKER.  WITH </p><p>EFFORTS IN THE CASAMANCE STYMIED DUE TO SENEGALESE </p><p>PRESIDENT WADE\'S SPHINX-LIKE SILENCE TO BANJUL\'S </p><p>OVERTURES, JAMMEH PICTURES THE MANO RIVER AS HIS </p><p>NEW WADING POOL.  SINCE PRESIDENT TAYLOR VISITED </p><p>BANJUL LATE MARCH, THE GAMBIA HAS BEEN MORE </p><p>INVOLVED IN ECOWAS DELIBERATIONS AND IN BILATERAL </p><p>CONTACTS WITH MONROVIA.  THE SOPHOMORIC JAMMEH MAY </p><p>BE OVER HIS HEAD AND WIND UP FLAILING IN THE MANO </p><p>RIVER TURBULENCE.  HIS INTERVENTION WILL LIKELY BE </p><p>INEFFECTUAL AND MAY ADD CONFUSION TO A MATTER </p><p>ALREADY FLUSH WITH TROUBLE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE PERSON AS POLICY </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE GAMBIA HAS NO ARTICULATED SUB-REGION </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY NOR STRATEGY.  JAMMEH AND COHORTS </p><p>HANDLE ISSUES ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  THEY </p><p>APPARENTLY HAVE EMBRACED THE WORKING ASSUMPTION </p><p>THAT A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY WOULD NOT EXCEED THE </p><p>SUM OF ITS COMPOSITE PARTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE LODESTAR OF GAMBIAN FOREIGN POLICY IS </p><p>JAMMEH\'S APPETITE FOR INFLUENCE, HIS DESIRE TO BE A </p><p>SUB-REGIONAL PLAYER OF SOME ACCOUNT.  BECAUSE THE </p><p>GAMBIA IS SMALL, WEAK AND POOR, JAMMEH HAS FEW </p><p>UTENSILS TO ACHIEVE HIS GOAL.  THUS, HE HAS USED </p><p>THE GAMBIA\'S RELATIVE DOMESTIC STABILITY AND ITS </p><p>INHERENT GEOPOLITICAL IMPUISSANCE TO WIGGLE HIMSELF </p><p>INTO THE MOLD OF A PEACE BROKER.  HOWEVER, CREATION </p><p>OF A REGIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF DURABLE PEACE AND </p><p>CONFLICT PREVENTION SEEMS LESS AN IMPERATIVE THAN </p><p>BEING PERCEIVED AS A CHARISMATIC LEADER CAPABLE OF </p><p>ENGINEERING DRAMATIC BREAKTHROUGHS.  DIPLOMACY AND </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY ARE CONDUCTED IN THE REALM OF </p><p>PERSONAL CONTACTS AND CHEMISTRY, NOT OBJECTIVE </p><p>NATIONAL INTERESTS.  DRUM ROLLS AND FANFARE LOOM </p><p>MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THE SUBSTANCE OF PEACE.  THE </p><p>BIRTHPLACE OF GAMBIAN FOREIGN POLICY SEEMS TO BE </p><p>MORE INTESTINAL THAN INTELLECTUAL. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THAT MILITARY CONFLICTS HAD VISITED GAMBIA\'S </p><p>IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS GAVE JAMMEH READY VENUES TO </p><p>PRACTICE HIS BRAND OF PERSONALIZED DIPLOMACY. </p><p>AFTER TRANSIENT SUCCESSES MEDIATING DISPUTES IN </p><p>GUINEA-BISSAU AND THE CASAMANCE IN 1999, JAMMEH\'S </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY HAS FOUNDERED LATELY.  HIS INFLUENCE </p><p>IN BISSAU AND DAKAR HAS WANED SINCE THE ELECTIONS </p><p>OF PRESIDENT YALA AND WADE, RESPECTIVELY.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>YALA AND WADE HAVE THEIR INTERNAL PROBLEMS AND </p><p>THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH EACH OTHER, JAMMEH </p><p>INCREASINGLY HAS BEEN THE ODD MAN OUT IN THIS PART </p><p>OF THE WEST AFRICAN NEIGHBORHOOD. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IN HIS LATEST ATTEMPT TO AVOID THIS DE FACTO </p><p>ISOLATION, JAMMEH HAS COURTED NOUAKCHOTT AS EVINCED </p><p>BY HIS EARLY MAY VISIT TO MAURITANIA WHERE SEVERAL </p><p>BILATERAL AGREEMENTS ON ECONOMIC COOPERATION WERE </p><p>EXECUTED.  IN PART THE DALLIANCE WITH NOUAKCHOTT IS </p><p>A CLUMSY ATTEMPT TO MAKE DAKAR "JEALOUS" AND THUS </p><p>PAY MORE ATTENTION TO BANJUL. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) JAMMEH REMAINS FOCUSSED ON MAXIMIZING HIS </p><p>INFLUENCE IN THE CASAMANCE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, WADE\'S INSCRUTABILITY HAS BEEN TOUGH </p><p>TO MAW.  THE GAMBIAN FEARS THAT WADE IS </p><p>COMMUNICATING WITH MFDC MODERATES WHILE KEEPING THE </p><p>GAMBIA OUT OF THE LOOP. CONSEQUENTLY, THE DYNAMIC </p><p>BETWEEN WADE AND JAMMEH REMAINS PRIMARILY </p><p>CENTRIFUGAL.  THE MORE WADE SEEMS TO KEEP JAMMEH </p><p>SIDELINED, THE MORE JAMMEH WANTS WADE TO FAIL. </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO VAULT INDIVIDUAL </p><p>PIQUE OVER NATIONAL INTERESTS, JAMMEH MAY FEEL </p><p>COMPELLED TO SYMPATHIZE WITH MFDC HARDLINERS AND </p><p>THEIR MUSCLE-FLEXING REACTIONS TO WADE\'S PEACE </p><p>STRATAGEM.  AS LONG AS WADE DOES NOT LET THE GAMBIA </p><p>MEDIATE THE NEGOTIATIONS, JAMMEH\'S ATTITUDE WILL BE </p><p>ONE OF SCHADENFREUDE NOT OF STATESMANSHIP IN </p><p>SCULPTING A GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY THAT ACTUALLY </p><p>PROMOTES A CASAMANCE PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>WADING INTO DEEP WATER - THE MANO RIVER FRAY </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DENIED HIS DESIRED ROLE IN THE CASAMANCE, </p><p>JAMMEH NOW PEERS AT THE MANO RIVER IMBROGLIO AS A </p><p>POTENTIAL VEHICLE TO SECURE HIS MANTLE AS PEACE </p><p>BROKER.  JAMMEH IS ALSO ENERGIZED BY THE BELIEF </p><p>THAT HE HAS THE INSIDE TRACK ON THE ECOWAS CHAIR </p><p>ONCE PRESIDENT KONARE COMPLETES THIS TERM. </p><p>CURRENTLY, JAMMEH SEES NO BETTER WAY TO PREPARE </p><p>HIMSELF FOR THIS ASCENSION THAN VISIBLE INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUE FACING THE SUB-REGION. </p><p>PRESIDENT TAYLOR\'S LATE MARCH VISIT TO BANJUL WAS </p><p>NOT A WHIM.  AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, TAYLOR LIKELY </p><p>HAD TWO RELATED OBJECTIVES.  FIRST, HE RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT JAMMEH MAY BE IN LINE FOR THE ECOWAS -- HE </p><p>WANTED TO CULTIVATE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP PRIOR </p><p>TO JAMMEH\'S TENURE.  SECOND, TAYLOR WANTED ECOWAS </p><p>TO BE A DIVIDED HOUSE REGARDING SANCTIONS AGAINST </p><p>LIBERIA.  REALIZING THAT MOST ECOWAS COLLEAGUES ARE </p><p>AGAINST HIM, TAYLOR SEEKS A SYMPATHETIC MINORITY TO </p><p>PREVENT ECOWAS CONSENSUS WHICH, IN TURN, WILL </p><p>IMPEDE ANTI-LIBERIA ACTION BY THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ALSO, THE COMMONALTIES BETWEEN THE TAYLOR </p><p>AND JAMMEH CANNOT BE IGNORED.  BOTH ARE DISLIKED BY </p><p>IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS.  BOTH BASICALLY ASSUMED POWER </p><p>BY THE MUSKET AND THUS ARE BETE NOIRE TO THEIR </p><p>COUNTRIES\' POLITICAL INTELLIGENCIA.  BOTH HAVE </p><p>STRONG ANTI-WESTERN STREAKS AND LONG STANDING TIES </p><p>TO LIBYA.  TAYLOR AND BABA JOBE, ARGUABLY THE </p><p>SECOND MOST POWERFUL FIGURE IN THE GAMBIA, TRAINED </p><p>TOGETHER IN LIBYA IN THE 1980S.  PREDICTABLY, JOBE </p><p>IS ENMESHED IN ALL FORMS OF SKULLDUGGERY.  WE </p><p>SUSPECT TAYLOR AND HIS COMPANIONS MAY HAVE EXPLORED </p><p>WITH JAMMEH AND JOBE THE USE OF THE GAMBIA AS A </p><p>POSSIBLE BACK ALLEY FOR COMMERCE TO ESCAPE UN </p><p>SANCTIONS.  BABA JOBE\'S ALMOST INNATE CRIMINALITY </p><p>WOULD LEAD HIM TO ACCEPT SUCH AN OFFER.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED BY ANY BANGLES AND </p><p>TRINKETS TAYLOR MIGHT HAVE OFFERED, JAMMEH WOULD BE </p><p>MORE CAUTIOUS THAN JOBE.  NONETHELESS, THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC OPENING BETWEEN BANJUL AND MONROVIA </p><p>PAVES THE ROAD FOR MORE CONTACTS AND THIS INCREASES </p><p>THE CHANCE OF ILLICIT COMMERCE FOR THERE ARE FEW </p><p>THINGS THAT THE LIBERIAN TOUCHES WHICH DO NOT </p><p>BECOME SULLIED. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) ALREADY, THE GAMBIA\'S VOCABULARY TOWARD </p><p>LIBERIA HAS CHANGED.  MONTHS AGO, FM SEDAT JOBE </p><p>WOULD IMPRECATE TAYLOR THE MOMENT THE LIBERIAN </p><p>ISSUE WAS RAISED.  DURING A MID-MAY CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH AMBASSADOR HALEY, JOBE GROANED THAT SANCTIONS </p><p>AGAINST LIBERIA WERE INIMICAL TO PEACE.  JOBE </p><p>PROTESTED THAT TRAVEL SANCTIONS WERE PARTICULARLY </p><p>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THEY WOULD PREVENT TAYLOR </p><p>FROM ATTENDING PEACE CONFERENCES.  JOBE WENT SO FAR </p><p>AS TO LABEL GUINEAN PRESIDENT CONTE, NOT TAYLOR, AS </p><p>THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO PEACE.  (COMMENT: THAT JOBE </p><p>WOULD UTTER SUCH AN IMPOVERISHED RATIONALE REVEALS </p><p>THE EXTENT THAT HE HAS RECEIVED NEW MARCHING ORDERS </p><p>REGARDING LIBERIA.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE GAMBIANS, SEEMINGLY OBLIVIOUS TO THE </p><p>RECENT HISTORY OF THE TROUBLED MANO RIVER UNION, </p><p>APPARENTLY BELIEVE THEY CAN SUCCEED WHERE OTHERS </p><p>HAVE WRECKED -- IN DISCOVERING A FORMULA THAT WILL </p><p>PERSUADE TAYLOR TO NEGOTI9E IN GOOD FAITH.  THE </p><p>FIRST STEP, ACCORDING TO THE GAMBIANS IS THE </p><p>HOLDING OF A TAYLOR-CONTE SUMMIT AIMED AT </p><p>PACIFICATION OF THE GUINEA-LIBERIA BORDER. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY THE GAMBIANS BLAME CONTE\'S REFUSAL TO </p><p>MEET TAYLOR AS THE MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK TO THEIR </p><p>APPROACH.  WE HAVE REMINDED THE GAMBIANS ABOUT THE </p><p>NUMEROUS MEETINGS ATTENDED BY BOTH CONTE AND TAYLOR </p><p>AND THE MANY COMMUNIQUQS BOTH HAVE SIGNED.  EVERY </p><p>KNOWN PLATITUDE AND BROMIDE KNOWN TO DIPLOMATIC MAN </p><p>HAS BEEN USED -- TO NO AVAIL.  WE ADVISED THAT </p><p>PUSHING FOR A SUMMIT IN THE ABSENCE OF ADEQUATE </p><p>PREPARATORY WORK WOULD RAISE EXPECTATIONS UNDULY. </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT WAS INEVITABLE BECAUSE THE GULF </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS IS MUCH TOO VAST TO BRIDGE </p><p>IN ONE HIGHLY VISIBLE MEETING.  INSTEAD, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS AND TECHNICAL EXPERTS NEED TO MEET TO </p><p>LESSON THE DIFFERENCES AND IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS </p><p>NEEDING PRESIDENTIAL RESOLUTION.  JOBE SAID HE </p><p>WOULD INCORPORATE THIS RECOMMENDATION IN THE </p><p>GAMBIA\'S APPROACH.  WE WILL SEE. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT: IN BOTH THE CASAMANCE AND THE MANO </p><p>RIVER PROCESSES, THE GAMBIA SEEKS A DRAMATIC </p><p>BREAKTHROUGH.  JAMMEH\'S EFFORTS ARE DRIVEN MORE BY </p><p>HIS ITCH TO BE A STAR THAN HIS DESIRE TO BE A </p><p>STATESMAN.  THEREFORE, HE SEEKS TO MAKE A BIG </p><p>SPLASH, GIVING SECONDARY CONSIDERATION TO WHETHER </p><p>HE IS JUMPING INTO SAFE WATERS OR A HOT CAULDRON. </p><p>EQUIPPED WITH NO REAL STRATEGY, JAMMEH\'S EFFORTS </p><p>LIKELY WILL NOT ADVANCE PEACE IN THE CASAMANCE NOR </p><p>LIBERIA.  UNFORTUNATELY, JAMMEH\'S MEDDLING IN THE </p><p>MANO RIVER FISTICUFFS WILL LIKELY SERVE TAYLOR\'S </p><p>AIMS.  JAMMEH\'S DIPLOMATIC EXPLOITS MAY CLOUD AND </p><p>WEAKEN ANY ECOWAS POLICY CONSENSUS REGARDING </p><p>SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBERIA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HALEY </p><p></p></div>
