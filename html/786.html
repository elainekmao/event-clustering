<p>S E C R E T STATE 260249 </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR SANDS/LEHR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 11/3/05 </p><p>TAGS:    PINR, PGOV, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: // INR ASSESSMENT // - NORTH KOREA - DANGER IN THE WIND </p><p> </p><p>DOD/ISA/AP FOR EIKENBERRY, NSC FOR ROTH/SUETTINGER, NSA </p><p>FOR LANDIS, DIA FOR NIXON, CIA WASHDC, LONDON FOR HALL, </p><p>ROME PLEASE PASS EMBASSY VATICAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FOLLOWING INR ASSESSMENT WAS PRODUCED BY THE </p><p>OFFICE OF EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC AND IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR </p><p>INFORMATION AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SUMMARY) PYONGYANG\'S ECONOMIC DISTRESS AND </p><p>CONTINUING POLITICAL PARALYSIS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>WHETHER THE CURRENT NORTH KOREAN REGIME CAN LAST THE </p><p>WINTER. IF PRAGMATISTS IN THE LEADERSHIP ARE UNABLE TO </p><p>SHOW TANGIBLE BENEFITS FROM THE AGREED FRAMEWORK SOON, </p><p>CONTINUED DETERIORATION OF THE ECONOMY AND WORSENING FOOD </p><p>SHORTAGES COULD PROMPT A TAKEOVER BY MILITARY HARDLINERS. </p><p> </p><p>THE NORTH KOREAN MILITARY ARE NOT "MODERNIZERS"--THEIR </p><p>COMING TO POWER WOULD GREATLY RAISE TENSIONS AND SHARPLY </p><p>INCREASE THE DANGER OF WAR. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF CONCERN </p><p>WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP OVER THE MILITARY\'S INTENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. WE DISAGREE WITH ASSESSMENTS, PRIMARILY FROM SOUTH </p><p>KOREA, THAT PERSONNEL CHANGES IN THE NORTH IN MID-OCTOBER </p><p>HAVE ALREADY PUT THE MILITARY IN CONTROL. THE NORTH\'S </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH KEDO AND THE CLEAR, CONSISTENT SIGNALS </p><p>IT IS SENDING SUPPORTING THE AGREED FRAMEWORK SUGGEST </p><p>THAT, SO FAR, THE AGREEMENT\'S FOES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>DERAIL IT OR SIGNIFICANTLY IMPEDE ITS IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>UNCOMMON FLEXIBILITY. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE NORTH\'S DELEGATES TO THE KEDO TALKS INSISTED </p><p>CRITICS WERE PRESSING THEM TO SECURE AN LWR SUPPLY </p><p>AGREEMENT, BUT USED THE POINT LESS TO PRESSURE KEDO THAN </p><p>AS A RATIONALE FOR MODIFYING THEIR OWN NEGOTIATING </p><p>POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>6. OTHER SIGNALS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THIS </p><p>INTERPRETATION. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE PARTY\'S 50TH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY FETE ON OCTOBER 10, THE MAIN SPEECH, </p><p>DELIVERED BY THE NEW DEFENSE MINISTER, CRITICIZED NEITHER </p><p>THE US OR THE AGREED FRAMEWORK. </p><p> </p><p>KEEPING A FIREBREAK. </p><p> </p><p>7. THOSE BACKING THE AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ISOLATE </p><p>THE KEDO TALKS FROM THE HARSH RHETORICAL EXCHANGES </p><p>BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH. THE NORTH\'S VENOMOUS </p><p>RESPONSE TO PROVOCATIVE ROK STATEMENTS HAS NOT KEPT IT </p><p>FROM NEGOTIATING ACROSS THE TABLE WITH ROK DELEGATES. </p><p>SUCH COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF ISSUES IS RARE DURING A TRUE </p><p>CRISIS OR POLICY REVERSAL. </p><p> </p><p>LEADERSHIP LOGJAM. </p><p> </p><p>8. WE BELIEVE THE DPRK LEADERSHIP IS SHARPLY DIVIDED, </p><p>AND THAT THE FRAMEWORK IS A SYMBOL OF WHAT ITS CRITICS </p><p>FEAR (AND ITS PROPONENTS HOPE) WILL BECOME THE NEW </p><p>REGIME\'S DIRECTION ON A BROAD RANGE OF FOREIGN AND </p><p>DOMESTIC ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>9. PRAGMATISTS SEEM TO FEAR A LOSS OF MOMENTUM IN THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK PROCESS, WHICH WOULD UNDERCUT THEIR ARGUMENT </p><p>THAT THE AGREEMENT BRINGS TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO THE NORTH. </p><p>THEY APPARENTLY SOLD THE AGREED FRAMEWORK AS A GOOD </p><p>BARGAIN--THE START OF A PROCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A </p><p>LESSENING OF MILITARY PRESSURES AND INCREASED FOREIGN </p><p>ECONOMIC COOPERATION. NOW, THEY ARE UNDER ATTACK FOR </p><p>HAVING COMPROMISED DPRK SECURITY AND GAINED LITTLE IN </p><p>RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>10. SHOWDOWN APPROACHING? A LENGTHY ARTICLE IN THE </p><p>PARTY NEWSPAPER EARLY THIS MONTH SUGGESTS THAT A SHOWDOWN </p><p>IS NEARING. IN DISCUSSING THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION, THE ARTICLE ALLUDED TO KHRUSHCHEV\'S DE </p><p>STALINIZATION CAMPAIGN, ARGUING THAT "ENEMIES AT HOME AND </p><p>ABROAD, USING THE ALLEGED PERSONALITY CULT AS AN EXCUSE, </p><p>LAUNCHED ATTACKS AND COMMITTED TRAITOROUS ACTS TO DAMAGE </p><p>HIS (STALIN\'S) AUTHORITY; THE COUNTRY WAS RUINED WHEN HIS </p><p>IDEAS AND ACHIEVEMENT WERE COMPLETELY REJECTED AND </p><p>NEGATED."  THE ARTICLE WENT ON TO WARN AGAINST HAVING </p><p>"ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE ENEMY\'S CONSPIRATORIAL PEACE </p><p>OVERTURES." </p><p> </p><p>11. THE ARTICLE APPEARS TO BE AN ESCALATION OF THE LONG- </p><p>RUNNING DEBATE BETWEEN THE REGIME\'S PRAGMATISTS AND </p><p>HARDLINERS. IN THE CURRENT SITUATION, REFERENCES TO A </p><p> "PERSONALITY CULT" AND DE-STALINIZATION COUPLED WITH </p><p>WARNINGS ABOUT THE ENEMY\'S "PEACE STRATEGY" ARE THE </p><p>POLITICAL EQUIVALENT OF NUCLEAR WARFARE. THE ARTICLE </p><p>NECESSARILY RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHO--ASSUMING IT IS </p><p>NOT KIM JONG IL--IS BEING SET UP TO PLAY THE ROLE OF </p><p>KHRUSHCHEV. </p><p> </p><p>12. SUCH RHETORIC SUGGESTS THAT THE SITUATION IS MOVING </p><p>TOWARD A SHOWDOWN. KIM JONG IL, WHOM INR BELIEVES LEANS </p><p>TOWARD HIS MORE PRAGMATIC ADVISORS, WOULD NO DOUBT LIKE </p><p>TO RESOLVE IT WITHOUT FIREWORKS. NEVERTHELESS, EVERYONE </p><p>IN THE LEADERSHIP (KIM MOST OF ALL) KNOWS THAT KIM IL </p><p>SUNG HAD TO PUT DOWN SEVERAL COUP ATTEMPTS IN THE LATE </p><p>195 OS BEFORE FIRMLY ESTABLISHING HIS POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>13. PRESSURE INCREASING. THE CHANCES OF A NEARTERM </p><p>SHOWDOWN ARE INCREASED BY UNREMITTING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>STRAINS AND POLITICAL PRESSURES GENERATED BY THE SLOW- </p><p>MOTION SUCCESSION. A HARSH WINTER, PUSHING THE ECONOMY </p><p>AND SOCIAL CONTROLS TO THE BREAKING POINT, WOULD PROBABLY </p><p>BE MORE THAN THE FRAGILE POLITICAL SYSTEM COULD ENDURE. </p><p>BY SPRING, FOOD SHORTAGES MAY BE THE WORST SINCE THE </p><p>KOREAN WAR. </p><p> </p><p>14. PARTICULARLY DISTURBING IS EVIDENCE THAT THE CENTER </p><p>IS NO LONGER ABLE TO HANDLE THE FOOD SITUATION AND IS </p><p>TELLING LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT THEY ARE ON THEIR OWN. </p><p>THAT MESSAGE WILL SEND SHOCKWAVES THROUGH THE POLITICAL </p><p>SYSTEM AND SORELY TEST SOCIAL CONTROL MECHANISMS. </p><p> </p><p>15.   WILL THE GENERALS STEP IN? SUCH A SCENARIO IS </p><p>UNLIKELY TO LEAD TO A SOFT LANDING"--THAT IS, PEACEFUL </p><p>TRANSFORMATION AND EVENTUAL REUNIFICATION WITH THE SOUTH. </p><p>RATHER, A SHARPLY DETERIORATING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>SITUATION IS LIKELY TO TRIGGER A TAKEOVER BY HARDLINE </p><p>MILITARY ELEMENTS--"TRUE BELIEVERS," FOR WHOM DISCIPLINE </p><p>AND MORAL RECTITUDE CAN OVERCOME ANY ADVERSITY, AND WHO </p><p>SEE COMPROMISE WITH "EVIL" AS DEFEAT. </p><p> </p><p>16.   FOR YEARS, THESE HARDLINERS HAVE BEEN CHAFING AT </p><p>WHAT THEY SEE AS A DANGEROUS DRIFT TOWARD POLICIES OF </p><p>OPENING AND REFORM.  THEY HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY ALARMED BY </p><p>EVENTS SINCE THE DEATH OF KIM IL SUNG. NEVER HAPPY WITH </p><p>THE SUCCESSION PLANS, THEY HAVE WATCHED WITH </p><p>CONSTERNATION AS KIM JONG IL HAS MOVED STEP-BY-STEP </p><p>TOWARDS AN ACCOMMODATION WITH THE US AND EXPERIMENTATION </p><p>WITH ECONOMIC REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>17.   UP TO NOW, KIM, LIKE HIS FATHER, HAS BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>KEEP THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS IN LINE. BUT </p><p>PRAGMATISTS IN THE REGIME FEAR THAT, IF THINGS REMAIN AS </p><p>THEY ARE, HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO MUCH LONGER. A </p><p>HIGH-RANKING PARTY OFFICIAL RECENTLY WARNED A FOREIGN </p><p>ACADEMIC THAT AN INTERNAL CRISIS WAS APPROACHING; HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THE MILITARY WAS DOMINATED BY DOGMATISTS </p><p>WHO LOOK ONLY TO VIOLENCE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. EARLIER </p><p>THIS MONTH, A DPRK DIPLOMAT TOLD A US OFFICIAL THAT THE </p><p>MILITARY WAS DETERMINED THAT ANY COLLAPSE OF THE NORTH </p><p>"WOULD NOT BE PEACEFUL." EVEN A HIGH-LEVEL KOREAN </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ARMY OFFICER PRIVATELY WARNED A FEW MONTHS AGO </p><p>THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO START US-DPRK MILITARY CONTACTS </p><p>BECAUSE THE ARMY WAS BECOMING RESTLESS AND HAD DANGEROUS </p><p>PLANS. (SECRET) (RCARLIN/JMERRILL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTOPHER </p><p></p></div>
