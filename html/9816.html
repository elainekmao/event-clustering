<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 001718 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BK, HR, Regional Issues </p><p>SUBJECT: ASHDOWN IN ZAGREB </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 1674 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR RALPH FRANK FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) DURING A JULY 30 VISIT TO ZAGREB, HIGH REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>ASHDOWN PRAISED THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S PRODUCTIVE POLICY </p><p>TOWARD BOSNIA OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AND EXPRESSED HOPE </p><p>    THAT THE POLICY WOULD CONTINUE AFTER UPCOMING ELECTIONS IN </p><p>CROATIA.  HE REFUSED TO BE ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATIONS ON THE </p><p>STATUS OF THE PORT OF PLOCE AND ON A ROAD CONSTRUCTION </p><p>PROJECT IN THE REGION OF NEUM, BIH, AND ENCOURAGED THE SIDES </p><p>TO WORK THROUGH THESE BILATERAL ISSUES THEMSELVES.  IN A </p><p>PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, ASHDOWN DESCRIBED OHR\'S </p><p>AMBITIOUS WORK PLAN FOR THIS AUTUMN AND ASKED THAT WE URGE </p><p>CROATIAN POLITICIANS TO ABSTAIN FROM CAMPAIGN RHETORIC WHICH </p><p>COULD AFFECT PROGRESS IN BIH.  HE AGREED TO CONTINUE TO PRESS </p><p>OTHER INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ACTORS TO ENSURE THE GOC MEETS </p><p>REFUGEE RETURN IMPLEMENTATION BENCHMARKS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) HIGH REPRESENTATIVE PADDY ASHDOWN VISITED ZAGREB ON </p><p>JULY 30 AT THE INVITATION OF THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT.  IN </p><p>MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT MESIC, PM RACAN, WITH </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS AND WITH THE PRESS, ASHDOWN PRAISED THE </p><p>RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S "PRODUCTIVE" POLICY TOWARD BIH AND </p><p>PRESIDENT MESIC\'S MORAL LEADERSHIP IN THE REGION.  IN HIS </p><p>MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, ASHDOWN THANKED THE USG FOR ITS </p><p>STEADFAST SUPPORT OF OHR\'S MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ASHDOWN SAID THAT HE REJECTED EFFORTS BY BOTH RACAN </p><p>AND MESIC TO GET OHR TO ENGAGE ON THE CORRIDOR 5C ROAD </p><p>PROJECT AND ON THE STATUS OF THE PORT OF PLOCE, BOTH ISSUES </p><p>ASHDOWN BELIEVES SHOULD REMAIN BILATERAL ISSUES.  AS HE DID </p><p>DURING HIS MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR (REF), RACAN TOLD </p><p>ASHDOWN THAT HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SPECTER OF "ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDING" FOR THE IMPORTANT ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AND </p><p>THOUGHT THAT THE TENDERING PROCESS WOULD BE BIASED TOWARD A </p><p>MAYLAYSIAN FIRM.  ASHDOWN SAID HE ASSURED RACAN THAT THE </p><p>BIDDING FOR THE PROJECT WOULD BE TO EUROPEAN STANDARDS AND </p><p>    THAT CONCERNS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE GOBIH, NOT TO OHR. </p><p>ASHDOWN SAID HE WAS PLEASED THAT IT APPEARED THE TWO SIDES </p><p>WERE COMING TO CLOSURE ON THE ISSUE OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT </p><p>ON THE STATUS OF THE PORT OF PLOCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ASHDOWN SAID HE WAS VERY RELIEVED TO HEAR CONFIDENT </p><p>PREDICTIONS FROM THE CURRENT COALITION ABOUT THE LIKELY </p><p>OUTCOME OF CROATIA\'S NEXT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT FOR ALL ITS FAULTS, THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY TOWARD </p><p>BIH HAS BEEN A "RAY OF LIGHT" IN THE REGION.  ASHDOWN </p><p>DESCRIBED A SERIES OF PROJECTS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING </p><p>NATIONAL-LEVEL BIH INSTITUTIONS WHICH OHR HOPES TO PRESS </p><p>FORWARD IN THE COMING MONTHS.  HE ALERTED THE AMBASSADOR THAT </p><p>NATIONALIST-LEANING POLITICIANS IN CROATIA MAY OBJECT TO SOME </p><p>OF THESE REFORMS; HE ASKED THAT THE USG URGE POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS TO ABSTAIN FROM MAKING THEM ISSUES IN THE UPCOMING </p><p>ELECTION CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ASHDOWN SAID THAT HE PLANNED A NEW REGIONAL </p><p>INITIATIVE TO RE-OPEN TRADE CORRIDORS FROM THE BIH REGION IN </p><p>TREBINJE TO THE CROATIAN CITY OF DUBROVNIK.  TREBINJE\'S </p><p>PROXIMITY TO DUBROVNIK AND THE "DE FACTO ECONOMIC BLOCKADE" </p><p>OF TRADE INTO CROATIA HAS TURNED THE TREBINJE REGION OF BIH </p><p>INTO A "NEST OF THIEVES."  HE HOPES TO ENGAGE WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO URGE THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES -- </p><p>ESPECIALLY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS -- TO DUBROVNIK.  ASHDOWN </p><p>SAID HE EXPECTED A FAIR HEARING IN ZAGREB, BUT HAD FEW HOPES </p><p>THAT DUBROVNIK MAYOR SUICA (HDZ) WOULD BE RECEPTIVE TO THE </p><p>INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>    6.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD ASHDOWN THAT REFUGEE RETURN AND </p><p>REINTEGRATION ISSUES REMAIN A TOP USG CONCERN FOR THE REGION. </p><p> DESPITE POSITIVE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW PROJECTS AND </p><p>CROSS-BORDER MEETINGS, THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS THE </p><p>GOC FOR PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION BEFORE GIVING CROATIA </p><p>CREDIT FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED </p><p>ASHDOWN TO ENSURE THAT IN MEETINGS WITH EU COLLEAGUES, HE </p><p>PRESS THEM TO INSIST ON RESULTS ON THE GROUND, NOT </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENTS IN ZAGREB.  ASHDOWN READILY AGREED THAT THE </p><p>TIME TO APPLY LEVERAGE IS NOW, AND SAID HE WOULD RAISE THE </p><p>ISSUE, ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE EU COUNTRIES LESS LIKELY TO HOLD </p><p>CROATIA ACCOUNTABLE. </p><p>FRANK </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
