<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002894 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: IMF SAYS REAL GDP TO CONTRACT 0.9 PERCENT </p><p>IN 2002 </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. An IMF team in Nigeria for Article IV consultations </p><p>reported that real GDP will fall by 0.9 percent in 2002, with </p><p>the oil sector contracting by 14 percent and the non-oil </p><p>sector--agriculture, manufacturing, and services--growing by </p><p>about 5 percent. The team says that a growing government </p><p>budget deficit will spell trouble for the economy by 2003, </p><p>but the Fund and Nigeria are unlikely to reach any agreement </p><p>on a new arrangement until after the April 2003 elections. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Visits Nigeria </p><p>------------------ </p><p>2. IMF Country Representative for Nigeria Gary Moser and </p><p>Washington-based IMF Assistant Director for West Africa </p><p>Menachem Katz on October 18 briefed the diplomatic community </p><p>on the Fund\'s Article IV review of Nigeria. The IMF and </p><p>Nigeria began these consultations in June 2002, but according </p><p>to Katz, they were postponed so that the team could get a </p><p>better idea of how the GON,s 2002 budget was being </p><p>implemented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Oil and Gas Slipping, Other Sectors Faring Better </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>3. Katz said the real economy would contract by 0.9 percent </p><p>in 2002. He noted that even with Nigerian crude selling at </p><p>close to $30/barrel, the oil and gas sector is expected to </p><p>contract by 14 percent in 2002 as a result of the much lower </p><p>output level that Nigeria negotiated with its OPEC partners. </p><p>Nigeria agreed to a quota of 1.787 million barrels per day </p><p>beginning 2002, down from 2.075 the previous year. Recent </p><p>investments in gas production are only beginning to bear </p><p>fruit and in 2002 were not enough to prop up the petroleum </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The IMF team reported that agriculture, manufacturing, and </p><p>services are faring much better in 2002. The forecast for </p><p>real growth in these non-oil sectors is between 5.0 and 5.3 </p><p>percent for 2002. Katz attributes most of the success in this </p><p>sector to a bumper crop on the agricultural side as well as </p><p>sustained demand for consumer goods and telecommunications </p><p>services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Inflation under Control, Exchange Rate Stable . . . </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>5. The IMF team reported that year-on-year inflation for 2002 </p><p>will be about 13.4 percent, down from about 18.9 in 2001. </p><p>Katz credited most of the decrease in the rate of inflation </p><p>to the rise in agricultural output, which resulted in lower </p><p>prices for food items. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Meanwhile, the IMF says that the introduction of the Dutch </p><p>Auction System has made for a dramatic improvement in </p><p>exchange rate policy. The Naira now trades at between 127 and </p><p>128 to the dollar, about 5.0 percent depreciation from before </p><p>the auction was introduced in July 2002, when it traded at </p><p>about 121. The team noted that there is still room for </p><p>improvement, however, suggesting that the 9.0 percent </p><p>differential between the parallel market and Central Bank </p><p>rates was still unacceptable. Moser previously told econoffs </p><p>that the IMF has recommended to Nigeria that there be no </p><p>differential, and the markets should be unified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Comment: That Nigeria unify its foreign exchange markets </p><p>is a long-standing demand of the IMF, but it is unlikely to </p><p>happen any time soon. Were it to happen, the Central Bank </p><p>would quickly run through its foreign exchange in an attempt </p><p>to prop up the naira. The alternative, allowing the naira to </p><p>depreciate, would not be tolerated by the political elite who </p><p>believe it is a symbol of Nigerian economic power and, maybe </p><p>more to the point, depend on it for cheap imports. End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> . . . but Government Deficit Could Reverse those Trends </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>8. The IMF team expressed concern that the large 2002 budget </p><p>deficit could spell serious macroeconomic problems. The IMF </p><p>considered the President\'s budget too expansionary; the </p><p>budget put forward by the National Assembly was even more so. </p><p>Katz said President Obasanjo had recognized that the budget </p><p>put forward by the legislature was unrealistic and had </p><p>ratcheted down spending considerably; even so, Katz estimates </p><p>that the 2002 deficit will be 5.7 percent of GDP, up from 4.0 </p><p>percent in 2001. He explained that the fall in revenues </p><p>caused by the contraction in the oil sector is not the real </p><p>problem--actual government oil revenues for 2002 are well </p><p>above the amount budgeted. Unconstrained--that is, more than </p><p>budgeted for--spending on civil service wages and pensions as </p><p>well as on capital projects is to blame, according to Katz. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. The question is, how will the GON finance the budget </p><p>deficit? Katz suggested two possibilities. The Central Bank </p><p>can monetize the deficit by buying debt from the GON and </p><p>paying for it with freshly minted naira. If the Central bank </p><p>were to decide to defend the naira in response to the </p><p>increasing inflation that would result from monetizing the </p><p>deficit, the end result would be a significant fall in the </p><p>bank\'s foreign exchange reserves. The other option is to </p><p>securitize the government\'s debt. Under this scenario, the </p><p>Central Bank might sit back and watch interest rates rise as </p><p>a result of the growing government budget deficit; with a </p><p>larger supply of government debt on the market, the interest </p><p>rate on that debt will be forced up to attract buyers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Katz explained that, in either case, the result will be a </p><p>fall in investment and trouble down the line for the real </p><p>economy. With high inflation, the cost of inputs would </p><p>increase; with high interest rates, financing would be more </p><p>expensive. In either case, output would fall. Comment: It is </p><p>extremely difficult to stabilize the macroeconomy in an </p><p>resource-dependent developing country. A sharp increase or </p><p>decrease in either output or prices might dramatically alter </p><p>macroeconomic scenarios. End comment. </p><p>Now What? </p><p>--------- </p><p>11. Moser said that the IMF Board of Directors will meet on </p><p>December 18 to review the Fund\'s Article IV consultations </p><p>with Nigeria. Implying that the Fund has no plans to renew </p><p>its program with Nigeria in the short term, Moser said the </p><p>Directors would likely discuss a future engagement with </p><p>Nigeria to begin after April 2003 presidential elections. </p><p>(Comment: The sentiment among the GON leadership is that </p><p>Nigeria doesn\'t need another IMF program and can move forward </p><p>on its own. Moser told us that President Obasanjo becomes </p><p>annoyed at the mere mention of the IMF. It will probably take </p><p>a crisis, economic or otherwise, to force the GON back to the </p><p>table with the IMF. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>12. Diversifying the economy, by using the proceeds of oil </p><p>and gas production to create a better climate for investment </p><p>in other sectors, remains the most pressing challenge for GON </p><p>economic management--as it has for over thirty years. </p><p>However, the non-oil economic growth that occurred in </p><p>2002--bumper crops in agriculture due mainly to good weather </p><p>and windfall profits in telecommunications reaped as Nigerian </p><p>GSM service catches up with the rest of the first-tier </p><p>developing countries--is not the kind of diversification that </p><p>is needed. The GON\'s medium-term development plan--unveiled </p><p>by President Obasanjo\'s Chief Economic Advisor Magnus Kpakul </p><p>at the Ninth Nigerian Economic Summit--is a good step toward </p><p>conceptualizing what needs to be done to reduce dependence on </p><p>oil.  Sustainable growth calls for the GON to improve </p><p>Nigeria\'s non-oil infrastructure, harmonize and stabilize its </p><p>fiscal and monetary policies, and establish a regulatory and </p><p>legal environment that encourages competition in key sectors </p><p>of the economy (Lagos septel). End comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
