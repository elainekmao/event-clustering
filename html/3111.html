<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001398 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF AND AF/S </p><p>USAID FOR AA/AFR, AA/DCHA, LPA </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT HINDERING FOOD DELIVERIES IN </p><p>OPPOSITION STRONGHOLD - A PORTENT OF POLICY PROBLEMS AHEAD </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1307 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Todd Faulk for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Assertions of humanitarian food aid </p><p>manipulation for political purposes have been increasingly </p><p>frequent in recent weeks.  Investigations have tended to </p><p>indicate that such abuses are episodic rather than centrally </p><p>manipulated.  However, recent reports from the Matabeleland </p><p>town of Binga have confirmed a serious and significant </p><p>attempt to deprive the needy of food aid for political and </p><p>historical reasons.  This is worrisome in the context of </p><p>recent discussions between staff members of the House </p><p>International Relations Committee (HIRC) and Minister of </p><p>Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare July Moyo (reftel), </p><p>who implied that the GOZ is willing to accept food aid, but </p><p>only on its owns terms.  There is the appearance that the GOZ </p><p>is playing poker with the donors, staking the welfare of </p><p>food-vulnerable Zimbabweans against donor demands for </p><p>responsible policy reform on the assumption that the donors </p><p>will fold in the face of impending humanitarian catastrophe </p><p>for which they will be blamed.  This approach, if pushed to </p><p>its limit, poses a serious dilemma for U.S. policy toward the </p><p>humanitarian relief program in Zimbabwe.  It will be </p><p>important to continue to do what we can to prevent human </p><p>suffering, but simultaneously we cannot lose sight of the </p><p>fact that yielding to GOZ demands that we play by their rules </p><p>will be at best a palliative, but not a curative, measure. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Situation in Binga </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In an effort to assert greater control over who </p><p>receives increasingly scarce food in Zimbabwe, the </p><p>Government, with the aid of war veterans and others, is </p><p>disrupting food deliveries in Binga, a predominantly Ndebele </p><p>district and opposition stronghold in Matabeleland North </p><p>province.  In a speech on May 18 in Binga town, Local </p><p>Government Minister Ignatius Chombo ordered the Catholic </p><p>Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP), an NGO distributing </p><p>food relief in Binga, to close down its operations in Binga </p><p>because it had created structures that compete with the </p><p>government\'s, according to the June 5 edition of the </p><p>independent "Daily News."  War veterans subsequently </p><p>surrounded the CCJP\'s food warehouse in Binga town, at the </p><p>southern end of Lake Kariba, to prevent any food supplies </p><p>from leaving the premises.  The CCJP feeding program </p><p>distributes food purchased by the British Catholic charity </p><p>CAFOD.  (Note: U.S. assistance distributed through WFP and </p><p>cooperating NGOs has not been similarly affected as yet.  End </p><p>note.)  On June 5, poloff spoke to Tarcisius Zimbiti, acting </p><p>director of CCJP, who verified that the story is essentially </p><p>true, and added that the war veterans took action only after </p><p>Chombo made his speech.  Zimbiti stated that although CCJP </p><p>cannot get any more food out of the warehouse in town, it is </p><p>still able to conduct limited food relief operations in rural </p><p>areas of Binga district using whatever supplies were already </p><p>outside the warehouse.  Zimbiti was unsure of the number of </p><p>people affected in the district because of the war veterans\' </p><p>actions, but confirmed that CCJP was unable to continue </p><p>supplying hospitals and schools in the district.  CCJP is </p><p>seeking a court injunction against the war veterans to compel </p><p>them to lift their siege, and it has repeatedly sought a </p><p>meeting with Minister Chombo, only to be told he is </p><p>"unavailable" until next week.  An American priest based in </p><p>Binga and the Apostolic Nuncio have also expressed concern </p><p>about restrictions on church feeding programs.  The Nuncio </p><p>intended to inform the Vatican and complain to the Foreign </p><p>Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The disruption of Binga food deliveries is not only a </p><p>Government attempt to control food distribution but it is an </p><p>extension of the Government\'s hostility toward Catholic and </p><p>other religious institutions critical of the Government\'s </p><p>human rights abuses, according to Shari Eppel, director of </p><p>Amani Trust/Matabeleland, a widely respected human rights </p><p>organization based in Bulawayo.  In addition to the CCJP </p><p>warehouse, the war vets barricaded the Catholic church in </p><p>Binga and prevented the priests there from leaving for </p><p>several days.   Nearly every day, the government-owned </p><p>Bulawayo "Chronicle" comes out with an article blasting </p><p>Bulawayo Archbishop Pius Ncube or the Catholic Church for </p><p>their critical statements, Eppel stated.  According to </p><p>another embassy source, the current standoff in Binga may be </p><p>an extension of a long-time feud between local war veterans </p><p>and the CCJP, which drafted the "Breaking the Silence" report </p><p>that exposed the government-ordered "Gukurahundi" massacres </p><p>of the 1980s in which thousands died. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) When asked about looming starvation in Binga, Eppel </p><p>iterated that food shortages are very serious throughout </p><p>Matabeleland North.  Some areas have not received any </p><p>deliveries for three weeks, and CCJP is now a major source of </p><p>food for many people, especially in areas far from Grain </p><p>Marketing Board silos.  People are undoubtedly dying, Eppel </p><p>stated, but so far, it is mainly the sick and elderly.  It is </p><p>difficult to say whether AIDS, old age, or the lack of food </p><p>is the primary cause of death.  "Would they have lived </p><p>another six months or a year had they had access to adequate </p><p>food?  It is hard to tell," she said. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>GOZ Puts on Poker Face and Sings "I\'ll Do It My Way" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a May 31 meeting with Minister of Public Service, </p><p>Labor and Social Welfare July Moyo (reftel), HIRC staffers </p><p>Pearl Alice Marsh and Malik Chaka posed several pointed </p><p>questions about the root causes and likely GOZ responses to </p><p>the growing food aid crisis.  Moyo\'s responses were </p><p>instructive as to government thinking, or the lack thereof, </p><p>on what should be their number-one policy priority for the </p><p>short term.  Moyo sought to keep Zimbabwe in the regional </p><p>herd by noting that all countries in the region are suffering </p><p>to some extent from drought, and he downplayed the role of </p><p>farming disruption caused by the ongoing "fast-track" </p><p>exercise.  He noted several times that no farmer had been </p><p>forced from his/her land and deprived of the opportunity to </p><p>produce, an assertion that is patent absurdity when examined </p><p>in the light of corroborated fact.  Moyo retreated to </p><p>standard ZANU-PF rhetoric, implying that other versions of </p><p>reality were largely a public relations ploy by Commercial </p><p>Farmers\' Union (CFU) members seeking to enlist popular </p><p>support for a land reform effort more to the CFU\'s liking. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) True to form, Moyo also saved some criticism for the </p><p>international donor community, characterizing their response </p><p>to the crisis as "low."  He acknowledged the severity of the </p><p>crisis and the need for assistance but fell back to the </p><p>position that the GOZ would, absent sufficient outside help, </p><p>do what was necessary to avoid famine and death from </p><p>starvation.  He recited the litany of agricultural pipe </p><p>dreams stored in the GOZ\'s rhetorical pouch - resettler wheat </p><p>production, winter maize, increased agricultural inputs for </p><p>next year - without ever admitting that basic policy reform </p><p>is necessary to reverse the crisis.  Moyo did not address the </p><p>potential private sector role in resolving the supply crisis </p><p>and did not link admitted funding constraints caused by forex </p><p>shortages to artificial exchange rates and similar policy </p><p>failures. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Challenged to explain Zimbabwe\'s huge grain deficit </p><p>in comparison to other countries in the region, Moyo </p><p>rationalized that Zimbabwe\'s "fall" from a relatively better </p><p>position than its neighbors exacerbated this impression.  In </p><p>perhaps his most shocking statement, Moyo asserted that a </p><p>more robust humanitarian response by donors would provide the </p><p>GOZ resources to rebuild the country.  The sub-text was clear </p><p>- the GOZ wants more donor assistance, but without strings </p><p>and on GOZ terms.  The refrain was equally clear - if donor </p><p>assistance under these conditions is not forthcoming, the </p><p>international community will share blame with the GOZ for the </p><p>humanitarian disaster that will follow. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The case of Binga, where the GOZ at best is not </p><p>stopping its supporters from preventing humanitarian food </p><p>relief for the vulnerable for political reasons, is </p><p>especially troubling in the context of the responsible </p><p>minister asserting that as far as donor food relief is </p><p>concerned, it\'s the GOZ\'s way or it\'s the highway.  While we </p><p>do not want to read too much into his words, Moyo seemed to </p><p>be implying an unstated strategy of calling the international </p><p>community\'s bluff by demanding that they deliver food aid on </p><p>GOZ terms or be willing to shoulder the blame for the </p><p>disaster that would follow.  The implication of this for USG </p><p>food aid policy in Zimbabwe is profound.  It is not in our </p><p>interest to permit starvation to spread, but it is not in our </p><p>power to prevent this if food aid, and the ability to use </p><p>this to punish opposition supporters, is left in the hands of </p><p>a government that to date has shown itself obsessed with </p><p>political vindictiveness and totally indifferent to the </p><p>welfare of the population, fairness, or policy reform.  To </p><p>yield to an attempted GOZ bluff might be a palliative measure </p><p>for some, but it would not offer any guarantees for all, and </p><p>in the final analysis it could never be curative absent </p><p>necessary policy reform.  From where we stand, it is a bluff </p><p>we must call. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment continued: For the above reasons, we </p><p>recommend plain speaking now about the reasons for Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>food crisis, and the need for impartial distribution of all </p><p>food assistance and complementary policy reforms.  Unlike its </p><p>neighbors, the GOZ has been unwilling to engage in a </p><p>constructive discussion with donors over how to address the </p><p>emerging crisis.  Thus, it is important to maintain a </p><p>distinction between the food crisis in Zimbabwe and that in </p><p>neighboring countries.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
