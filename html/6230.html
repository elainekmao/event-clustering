Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  There are concerns that Tamils may be </p><p>subject to communal attacks on the margins of a </p><p>demonstration by Opposition elements in Colombo today </p><p>(March 10).  A letter from the president to the PM </p><p>helped spark these concerns.  Mission has spoken to </p><p>contacts and urged that Tamils be given full protection, </p><p>and -- as of late afternoon March 10 -- we have not </p><p>heard of any incidents.  A renewal of inter-ethnic </p><p>violence would seriously undermine the peace process. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Opposition Demonstration </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Key elements of the Opposition are holding a </p><p>large demonstration in Colombo today (March 10).  The </p><p>demonstration is being sponsored by the Sri Lanka </p><p>Freedom Party (SLFP), the largest constituent element </p><p>within the president\'s People\'s Alliance (PA) party, and </p><p>the radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party.  The </p><p>small Sinhalese extremist Sihala Urumaya (SU) party is </p><p>also participating in the rally. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The demonstration has been called by the SLFP </p><p>and the JVP to protest against cost of living increases </p><p>and the GSL\'s peace initiative.  The SLFP and the JVP </p><p>have made a comprehensive effort to turn out a large </p><p>crowd, but it is not yet clear how many people plan to </p><p>participate.  The number should be in the thousands </p><p>based on the turnout of previous Opposition rallies held </p><p>earlier this year.  Police are worried enough by the </p><p>potential size of the crowd and the potential for </p><p>trouble that some roads are being closed.  Parents are </p><p>also bringing their children home from school early. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Concern about Possible Communal Attacks </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) There are concerns that Tamils may be subject to </p><p>communal attacks on the margins of the demonstration. </p><p>These concerns were largely sparked by a letter that </p><p>President Kumaratunga sent to Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe late March 7.  The letter related that </p><p>the president had heard that pro-GSL elements were </p><p>planning attacks on Tamils, and that there was a plan </p><p>afoot to blame any such incidents on the demonstrators </p><p>(and thus the Opposition).  The letter went on to urge </p><p>that the PM look into the reports and put a stop to the </p><p>alleged plans.  (Note:  The letter has not been </p><p>released, but the press has reported on its contents and </p><p>contacts have told us about it.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Although the president\'s letter asserts that </p><p>GSL supporters would be the source of any problems, word </p><p>on the street is that it is the demonstrators themselves </p><p>that may try to attack Tamils.  It is not clear what the </p><p>source of this "street" information is, but the </p><p>president\'s letter seems to be the main source, along </p><p>with other (unidentified) reports.  In any case, Tamils </p><p>have told us they are very worried about the situation, </p><p>especially in light of the past history of communal </p><p>violence in Colombo.  (Note:  Colombo has a large Tamil </p><p>minority, which has been the victim of communal attacks </p><p>many times before.  Most notorious was the July 1983 </p><p>riot in which hundreds of Tamils were killed by </p><p>rampaging Sinhalese mobs.  The intensification of the </p><p>country\'s ethnic problems into large-scale armed </p><p>conflict dates from this riot.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Commenting on the situation, Desmond Fernando, a </p><p>well-known, well-connected human rights lawyer, told us </p><p>that all the concern was merited.  The president\'s </p><p>letter, he felt, seemed to insert a discordant communal </p><p>note into the peace process debate.  He thought it was </p><p>possible that members of her party might be planning to </p><p>cause communal problems at the March 10 demonstration or </p><p>later.  He said he had spoken with the PM, who had </p><p>assured him that the government was taking all steps </p><p>necessary to protect Tamils and their property. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) (((Note:  As of late afternoon March 10, </p><p>Mission has heard no reports of anti-Tamil incidents. </p><p>The demonstration seems to be large, but orderly, thus </p><p>far.))) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Mission Presses Contacts </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In response to the concerns, Mission has </p><p>approached contacts in the government and the </p><p>Opposition.  The Ambassador spoke with Milinda Moragoda, </p><p>the Minister of Economic Reforms and a key adviser to </p><p>the PM, and urged that the GSL take all steps necessary </p><p>to protect Tamils and their property.  Moragoda replied </p><p>that the GSL was doing this.  He noted that he did not </p><p>believe that Tamils were in danger and was not worried </p><p>about the situation.  Polchief also spoke to Harim </p><p>Peiris, an assistant to President Kumaratunga.  Peiris </p><p>said demonstrators had no plans to attack Tamils.  That </p><p>said, he remarked that it was vital for the government </p><p>to ensure that the demonstration was not interfered </p><p>with.  If it was, there could be some problems between </p><p>police and demonstrators.  Poloff also spoke to </p><p>Norwegian Embassy contact Tomas Stangeland, who </p><p>expressed concern about the reports, but said he had no </p><p>further information. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Since the advent of the government\'s peace </p><p>initiative in December 2001, we have not heard any </p><p>serious rumblings of an anti-Tamil communal nature, </p><p>which is why the latest reports are so striking.  Thus </p><p>far, opponents of the GSL\'s peace initiative in the </p><p>south have been very careful not to make their cause an </p><p>anti-Tamil one.  That said, the rhetoric of those who </p><p>are against the peace initiative is steadily </p><p>intensifying.  Anura Bandaranaike, a senior PA MP and </p><p>the president\'s brother, for example, was cited last </p><p>week as stating that if the Opposition came to power it </p><p>would seek an immediate "end" to the peace process. </p><p>Certainly, a renewal of inter-ethnic violence would </p><p>seriously undermine the peace process.  Whether there </p><p>are some who want to play such a dangerous game for </p><p>political gain is not yet clear, but needs continued </p><p>monitoring -- especially given the latest reports and </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s past record of communal violence.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
