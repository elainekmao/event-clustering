OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED INCREASE </p><p>IN SPECULATIVE, IMAGINARY AND FALSE ARTICLES BY THE SO- </p><p>CALLED INDEPENDENT MEDIA BOTH INTERNALLY AND </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY, ON THE STATUS AND OPERATIONS OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS.  THESE STATEMENTS HAVE </p><p>CAUSED INSECURITY, UNCERTAINTY, CONFUSION AND HAVE IN THE </p><p>MAIN TARNISHED THE CREDIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ARMS </p><p>OF THE STATE OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>2. ALL THESE MACHINATIONS HAVE PROMPTED THE CONVENING OF </p><p>THIS PRESS BRIEF TO ARTICULATE THE POSITION OF THE SECURITY </p><p>FORCES WHOSE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IS THE DEFENSE OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>AND ITS INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. ZIMBABWEANS FOUGHT A BITTER AND PROTRACTED STRUGGLE TO </p><p>LIBERATE THEMSELVES FROM IMPERIALISM, COLONIALISM, </p><p>SETTLERISM AND ALL FORMS OF NEO-COLONIALISM.  THE OBJECTIVE </p><p>OF THIS BITTER STRUGGLE WAS TO ATTAIN POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, </p><p>SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY.  THIS </p><p>WOULD ENSURE THAT ZIMBABWEANS RESTORE THEIR DIGNITY, </p><p>RESPECT, FREEDOM AND SECURITY LONG DENIED THEM BY THEIR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00107  01 OF 03  101512Z </p><p>SETTLER COLONIZERS.  IN THE PROCESS OF STRIVING TO ACHIEVE </p><p>THESE VALUES, OVER 50,000 ZIMBABWEANS PERISHED, THOUSANDS </p><p>WERE JAILED, MAIMED AND MANY MORE LEFT HOMELESS AND WITHOUT </p><p>PARENTS OR CHILDREN DURING THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE. </p><p> </p><p>4. TO SAFEGUARD OUR HISTORY, INDEPENDENCE, SOVEREIGNTY, </p><p>TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL HERITAGE AND </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS, THE </p><p>SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS COMPRISING THE ZNA, AFZ, POLICE, CIO </p><p>AND THE PRISON SERVICE WERE ESTABLISHED AS PROVIDED FOR IN </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION OF ZIMBABWE.  THIS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION </p><p>IS NOT ONLY APPLICABLE TO ZIMBABWE BUT IS UNIVERSALLY </p><p>ACCEPTED AND PRACTICED. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE </p><p>SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS IS TO ENSURE THAT OUR HARD-WON </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, SOVEREIGNTY, NATIONAL HERITAGE, DIGNITY, </p><p>CULTURE, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED AT ALL </p><p>COSTS.  FORTUNATELY FOR ZIMBABWEANS, THE SECURITY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS HAVE A LEADERSHIP THAT WAS PART OF THE BITTER </p><p>STRUGGLE FOR LIBERATION.  THIS STRUGGLE DEVELOPED POLITICAL </p><p>CADIES WHO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF ZIMBABWE\'S HISTORY, </p><p>VALUES AND DESTINY.  HIGH TRAINING STANDARDS AND IRON-CLAD </p><p>DISCIPLINE HAS CREATED HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL ARMS OF SECURITY </p><p>WHICH HAVE GENERATED A SENSE OF SECURITY AND TRUST AT HOME, </p><p>AND HIGH REGARD INTERNATIONALLY. </p><p> </p><p>6. ANY NATION, AND ZIMBABWE IS NO EXCEPTION, HAS SECURITY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE GOVERNED BY LAWS, RULES AND </p><p>REGULATIONS DEFINED BY THE CONSTITUTION TO STREAMLINE AND </p><p>ENHANCE THEIR OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES.  THESE SYSTEMS ARE NOT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00107  01 OF 03  101512Z </p><p>ESTABLISHED BY INDIVIDUALS OR INCUMBENTS HOLDING EXISTING </p><p>POSTS BUT ARE MEANT TO SERVE SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS.  SO </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS SHOULD KNOW THAT THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE AT THE </p><p>MOMENT ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THE </p><p>CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ZIMBABWEANS. </p><p> </p><p>7. THERE IS THEREFORE NEED FOR ZIMBABWEANS TO RESPECT THESE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALLY ESTABLISHED SYSTEMS BECAUSE FAILURE TO DO </p><p>SO WOULD RESULT IN INSTABILITY, LAWLESSNESS AND ULTIMATELY, </p><p>ANARCHY.  THE IMPACT OF MALICIOUS DISRESPECT AND GENERALIZED </p><p>MALIGNING OF SECURITY ARMS OF THE STATE IS THAT SOCIETY </p><p>LOSES CONFIDENCE IN THE SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT THEREBY </p><p>UNDERMINING THE SECURITY OF THE NATION. </p><p> </p><p>8. GIVEN THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE </p><p>LEARNT A LOT OF LESSONS FROM SITUATIONS OF ANARCHY </p><p>REGIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY: FOR EXAMPLE IN SOMALIA, </p><p>RWANDA, ANGOLA, SIERRA LEONE, KOSOVO, EAST TIMOR AND DRC, </p><p>THEY NATURALLY, CANNOT ALLOW SUCH SITUATION TO DEVELOP IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  OUR RECORD IN CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE IN NEARLY ALL </p><p>THESE COUNTRIES BEARS TESTIMONY TO OUR CAPABILITIES.  ALL </p><p>THIS CLEARLY AND IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS DEFINE THE HISTORY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND ITS PEOPLE, FOR A PEOPLE WITHOUT A HISTORY ARE </p><p>A PEOPLE WITHOUT A DESTINY.  EQUALLY, A PEOPLE WITHOUT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2115 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00107  02 OF 03  101512Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------55E899  101512Z /38 </p><p>O 101406Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0710 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, PREL, MARR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TRANSCRIPT OF THE JANUARY 9 PRESS BRIEF BY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00107  02 OF 03  101512Z </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN SECURITY CHIEFS </p><p> </p><p>PEACE, LAW AND ORDER CANNOT DEVELOP. </p><p> </p><p>9. WHILE IT IS THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA TO INFORM AND EDUCATE </p><p>THE PUBLIC, THERE IS NEED FOR THE MEDIA TO UNDERSTAND THE </p><p>FOLLOWING WITH REGARDS TO SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>  A.   THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLITICAL AND </p><p>     SECURITY SYSTEMS.  IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS THAT IN THE PROCESS </p><p>     OF PROVIDING INFORMATION, THE MEDIA MUST SEPARATE THE TWO. </p><p> </p><p>  B.   ATTACKS ON INDIVIDUALS BASED ON CONTRIVED INFORMATION </p><p>     BY THE MEDIA USING EXISTING SECURITY ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS </p><p>     BREED MISUNDERSTANDINGS, MISTRUST, DIVISIONS AND UNDERMINE </p><p>     THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS.  TYPICAL </p><p>     EXAMPLES ARE: </p><p> </p><p>       (1)  COUP REPORT BY RAY CHOTO/MARK CHAVHUNDUKA </p><p>(2)  THE ALLEGED BURIAL OF A SOLIDER WITHOUT A HEAD BY GRACE </p><p>KWINJEH </p><p>(3)  DRC REPORTS ON ALLEGED LOOTING BY ZIMBABWEAN MILITARY </p><p>AND POLITICAL LEADERSHIP </p><p>(4)  ATTACKS ON THE PERSON AND OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT </p><p>(5)  MASARA-NYAROTA REPORT </p><p>(6)  ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICAL VICTIMIZATION BY PRISON </p><p>OFFICERS. IN ALL THESE CASES, NO IOTA OF EVIDENCE WAS </p><p>PROVIDED. </p><p>(7)  FINGAZ REPORT BY DAVID MASUNDA ALLEGING THAT THE </p><p>SECURITY CHIEFS HAD ADVISED THE PRESIDENT TO GO. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00107  02 OF 03  101512Z </p><p>  C.   WHILST IT IS KNOWN THAT MEDIA HOUSES ARE IN BUSINESS, </p><p>     THEY MUST NOT GENERATE PROFITS OUT OF FALSE REPORTS THAT </p><p>     DISCREDIT THE LEADERSHIP AND MEMBERSHIP OF SECURITY </p><p>     ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>  D.   SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS BY THEIR NATURE ARE SENSITIVE </p><p>     INSTITUTIONS AND THE SAME APPLIES TO THE INCUMBENT </p><p>     LEADERSHIP.  THIS IS NOT A NEW POINT TO MAKE AS THIS </p><p>     SENSITIVITY IS KNOWN AND RESPECTED IN AND BY ALL SOCIETIES </p><p>     OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING INSTITUTIONS I THOSE SOCIETIES.  IT </p><p>     IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT THAT MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS VERIFY </p><p>     REPORTS ON SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS PRIOR TO THEIR </p><p>     PUBLICATION.  MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT </p><p>     INDIVIDUALS IN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS </p><p>     LIKE ANY OTHER CITIZEN OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>  E.   THE MEDIA SHOULD NOT CREATE SITUATIONS THAT INVITE THE </p><p>     SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS TO BE INVOLVED.  OUR EXPERIENCES HAVE </p><p>     SHOWN THAT WHEN SITUATIONS DETERIORATE AND SECURITY FORCES </p><p>     ARE CALLED UP, IT IS USUALLY THE INNOCENT MAJORITY WHO </p><p>     SUFFER MOST.  FURTHERMORE, EXPERIENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT </p><p>     MISREPRESENTATION OF FACTS BY THE MEDIA HAVE RESULTED IN </p><p>     CONFLICTS. </p><p> </p><p>10. WE ARE THEREFORE ADVISING ALL CITIZENS OF ZIMBABWE THAT </p><p>ANY REPORTS AND ACTIONS DESIGNED TO CREATE INSTABILITY IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE WILL BE MET BY THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW.  THIS </p><p>WILL INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT, WHERE IT IS DEEMED NECESSARY. </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ANSWERABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.  THE LAW </p><p>WILL TAKE ITS COURSE TO ENSURE THAT ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE, </p><p>TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY, WHICH TO A LARGE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00107  02 OF 03  101512Z </p><p>EXTEND DEPEND ON UPHOLDING THE VALUES AND GOOD NAME OF THE </p><p>SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRESERVED. </p><p> </p><p>11. SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE THEREFORE APPEALING TO OUR </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS TO ENACT LAWS THAT PROTECT OUR SOVEREIGNTY </p><p>AND INDEPENDENCE AND THAT SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE </p><p>MAJORITY OF ZIMBABWEANS. </p><p> </p><p>12. THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS WANT ZIMBABWEANS TO CAMPAIGN </p><p>AND VOTE IN A PEACEFUL MANNER.  THERE SHOULD BE NO </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT OF VIOLENCE AND POLITICAL LEADERS AND THEIR </p><p>FOLLOWERS SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.  SECURITY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RESOLVED TO PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT </p><p>CONDUCIVE TO A PEACEFUL ELECTORAL PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>13. IN PURSUING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, THE SECURITY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ARE GUIDED BY TWO CRUCIAL VALUES.  THE FIRST </p><p>AND MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT THOSE WHO FOUGHT AND DIED FOR THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF ZIMBABWE DID NOT DO SO IN VAIN.  SECONDLY, ANY </p><p>CHANGE DESIGNED TO REVERSE THE GAINS OF THIS REVOLUTION WILL </p><p>NOT BE SUPPORTED. </p><p> </p><p>14. AS WE CONCLUDE THIS PRESS BRIEF, WE WISH TO MAKE IT VERY </p><p>CLEAR TO ALL ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS THAT THE SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2116 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00107  03 OF 03  101512Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------55E89B  101512Z /38 </p><p>O 101406Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0711 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, PREL, MARR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TRANSCRIPT OF THE JANUARY 9 PRESS BRIEF BY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00107  03 OF 03  101512Z </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN SECURITY CHIEFS </p><p> </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS WILL ONLY STAND IN SUPPORT OF THOSE POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS THAT WILL PURSUE ZIMBABWEAN VALUES, TRADITIONS AND </p><p>BELIEFS FOR WHICH THOUSANDS OF LIVES WERE LOST, IN PURSUIT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE\'S HARD WON INDEPENDENCE, SOVEREIGNTY, </p><p>TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND NATIONAL INTERESTS.
