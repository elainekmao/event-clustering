<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000259 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TREASON TRIAL OF MDC PRESIDENT ENTERS THIRD DAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 230 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>Trial proceeds slowly </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The treason trial of three Movement for Democratic </p><p>Change (MDC) leaders -- President Morgan Tsvangirai, </p><p>Secretary-General Welshman Ncube, and Member of Parliament </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Renson Gasela -- began as scheduled in Zimbabwe\'s High Court </p><p>on February 3 and is now in its third day on February 5.  On </p><p>the first day, GOZ deputy attorney-general Bharat Patel </p><p>summarized the state\'s case, which is that the three MDC </p><p>leaders hired a Canadian political consulting firm -- Dickens </p><p>and Madson -- to arrange the assassination of President </p><p>Mugabe.  Patel indicated that state witnesses would include, </p><p>inter alia, Dickens and Madson director Ari Ben-Menashe, Air </p><p>Force Commander Perence Shiri, and Central Intelligence </p><p>Director Happyton Bonyongwe.    In his summary, the lead </p><p>counsel for the accused -- renowned South African attorney </p><p>George Bizos -- emphasized that his clients belong to a </p><p>political party which is committed to the rule of law and to </p><p>the achievement of change via a constitutional process and </p><p>declared that the charges had been filed to discredit and </p><p>embarrass the accused.  Bizos acknowledged that Tsvangirai </p><p>had met with Ben-Menashe, but said he had done so at the </p><p>request of Dickens and Madson, which had pressed the MDC </p><p>President to enter into a political consultancy arrangement. </p><p> </p><p>Ari Ben-Menashe </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The second and third days of the trial (February 4 and </p><p>5) have been consumed by the state\'s questioning of its star </p><p>witness, Ari Ben-Menashe and examination of the infamous </p><p>videotape, in which the "elimination" of President Mugabe was </p><p>allegedly discussed.  The prosecutor walked Ben-Menashe </p><p>through how he was introduced to Tsvangirai and his MDC </p><p>colleagues, and what was discussed at each of their meetings. </p><p> Ben-Menashe claimed that it was the MDC who sought a </p><p>relationship with his company and that it was Tsvangirai who </p><p>asked for his company\'s help in arranging the assassination </p><p>of Mugabe.   Ben-Menashe did admit to signing a contract with </p><p>the GOZ for provision of consultancy services, but only in </p><p>January 2002, after the videotape of his final meeting with </p><p>Tsvangirai was made.  He said the government had agreed to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>pay him U.S. $1,000,000 for his services and had disbursed </p><p>only about U.S.$400,000 of that sum to date.   Ben-Menashe </p><p>claimed that he had informed the U.S. Government of the plot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The prosecution spent half of February 4 and all of </p><p>February 5 eliciting Ben-Menashe\'s commentary -- in agonizing </p><p>detail -- on the grainy videotape of the fateful meeting. </p><p>Much of what is said on the videotape is unintelligible, and </p><p>it is impossible to make out most of the faces of those who </p><p>attended the meeting.   (Comment:  Ben-Menashe has appeared </p><p>to be reading from a ZANU-PF script -- his testimony was </p><p>sprinkled with such familiar phrases as "the MDC represents </p><p>its masters, the UK government and white Rhodesians," and </p><p>"Tony Blair\'s imperialism."  Ben-Menashe came across mostly </p><p>as an unprincipled buffoon, and his testimony regularly </p><p>elicited derisive laughter or whistling from the crowd.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Ben-Menashe has stated that he plans to depart </p><p>Zimbabwe on February 7, but the presiding judge -- Paddington </p><p>Garwe -- has not indicated whether he will permit this.  The </p><p>MDC is planning to cross-examine Ben-Menashe for up to two </p><p>weeks, and his departure on Friday would provide only a day </p><p>for cross-examine.  In a conversation with us, Bizos called </p><p>Ben-Menashe "a cross-examiner\'s dream," and said his early </p><p>departure would seriously prejudice the defense\'s case. </p><p> </p><p>Access problems </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Obtaining access to the courtroom was much smoother </p><p>after the chaotic first day of the trial, when large numbers </p><p>of journalists, diplomats, MDC officials, and members of the </p><p>general public were denied entry.  On the second and third </p><p>days, police presence for blocks around remained heavy, but </p><p>all interested diplomats were admitted, along with a number </p><p>of international journalists -- AP, Reuters, The Guardian, </p><p>and stringers for a number of international news services. </p><p>Each day, the GOZ has packed a number of seats with security </p><p>service members while continuing to restrict access by </p><p>members of the general public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
