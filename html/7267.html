(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: Post has engaged UAE officials </p><p>at all levels of government regarding humanitarian assistance </p><p>since the onset of war in Iraq began. In line with the UAEG\'s </p><p>preference to provide assistance-in-kind rather than cash </p><p>donations, the UAEG is facilitating the shipment of </p><p>humanitarian supplies to Iraq. The UAE Red Crescent Authority </p><p>(headquartered in Abu Dhabi) and the Mohammed Bin Rashid </p><p>Al-Maktoum Charity and Foundation in Dubai are coordinating </p><p>the outpouring of donations from the Emirati public.  We will </p><p>continue to report the activities of these charities and the </p><p>UAEG as they support the humanitarian effort in Iraq.  End </p><p>summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Per refs B and C, UAE Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs has noted to the Ambassador on several occasions that </p><p>the UAE RCA had purchased about $3 million USD in medical </p><p>supplies and other necessities just prior to the war and </p><p>delivered the goods to Iraqi hospitals.  Most recently, the </p><p>office of UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Shaykh Mohammed bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nahyan on 4/6 requested Post\'s assistance to </p><p>coordinate the delivery of 700 tons of foodstuffs, and nine </p><p>vehicles (including four water tankers and an ambulance) </p><p>with the Humanitarian Operations Center and the ICRC </p><p>representative in Kuwait.  UAE First Lady Shaykha Fatima this </p><p>week donated an approximate $2 million USD to the UAE RCA for </p><p>the Iraqi people. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In Dubai, the Shaykh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum </p><p>Charity and Humanitarian Foundation (whose patron is the UAE </p><p>Defense Minister and Dubai Crown Prince) continues to collect </p><p>cash donations and humanitarian supplies on behalf of the 16 </p><p>charities in the UAE that it represents, and has expressed </p><p>an interest in sending these supplies to Iraq soon. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In addition, the UAE Foreign Ministry signed in late </p><p>March an agreement with the United Nations World Food Program </p><p>(WFP) formalizing WFP\'s regional office in Dubai.  The WFP </p><p>office has been operating in Dubai for some time, however, </p><p>and recent press reports indicate that the WFP facility in </p><p>Dubai will be a major transshipment point for humanitarian aid </p><p>destined to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
