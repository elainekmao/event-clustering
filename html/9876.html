The military opposes AKP plans to </p><p>trim the powers of the NSC by transforming the council into </p><p>an advisory body.  Deputy Chief of TGS, General Yasar </p><p>Buyukanit, has been promoted as commander of the First Army. </p><p>General Buyukanit is set to become the chief of TGS </p><p>following General Ozkok\'s retirement in 2006.  Commanders </p><p>strongly warned Prime Minister Erdogan against the ruling </p><p>AKP\'s anti-secularist policies, according to press reports. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" slams the government for attempting to acquire </p><p>full control of the state structure to change the regime. </p><p>Erdogan and the Minister of Defense, Vecdi Gonul, objected </p><p>to the YAS decision to expel 20 fundamentalist officers from </p><p>the army.  Erdogan and Gonul signed the decision, but said </p><p>the dismissed officers should be given a right to appeal. </p><p>TGS Chief General Ozkok said at the meeting that such </p><p>objections by the ruling party would encourage </p><p>fundamentalists in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New Invitation for International troops to Iraq: Washington </p><p>is about to renew, through the Iraqi Temporary Council, its </p><p>appeal for troops from countries which have displayed a </p><p>reluctance to join peacekeeping operations in Iraq, Monday\'s </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" reports.  The Iraqi Governing Council is </p><p>particularly interested in participation by India and </p><p>Pakistan.  Turkey had earlier told the U.S. that Ankara </p><p>would prefer to deploy troops in Iraq under a UN or NATO </p><p>umbrella, or through the direct invitation of the Iraqi </p><p>Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economy: The decrease in the inflation rate continued in </p><p>July, as wholesale prices (WPI) for the month fell by 0.5 </p><p>percent, and consumer price inflation (CPI) dropped by 0.4 </p><p>percent.  Annually, the WPI was estimated at 25.6 percent, </p><p>and CPI at 27.4 percent.  Exports have increased by 31.2 </p><p>percent annually.  IMF board praised recent economic reforms </p><p>by the GOT, and released a $476 million loan, which had been </p><p>delayed pending the outcome of the fifth review.  The IMF </p><p>board also approved a delayed payment schedule for Turkey\'s </p><p>$16 billion loan package, which will effectively decrease </p><p>Turkey\'s repayment burden by about $11 billion in 2004 and </p><p>2005.  Weekend papers hailed the decision, calling it a </p><p>`kiss of life\' for Turkey\'s economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President Sezer losing support - Poll: A survey by the ANAR </p><p>service concluded that 66.7 percent of Turks believe that </p><p>President Sezer did not show sufficient interest in the </p><p>detention of Turkish troops in Suleymaniye, according to </p><p>Monday\'s "Yeni Safak."  68 percent of those surveyed oppose </p><p>the deployment of Turkish troops in Iraq.  42 percent </p><p>support the Repentance Law for defectors from terrorist </p><p>organizations, while 41 percent are opposed.  Another </p><p>survey, conducted by the Verso organization, reported that </p><p>57.4 percent of Turks believe that the Suleymaniye event had </p><p>a very damaging effect on Turkish-U.S. relations.  If </p><p>general elections were held today, AKP would get 42.2 </p><p>percent of the vote.  Other political parties trail far </p><p>behind: CHP 16.3, DYP 12.8, Genc Party 11.6, and DEHAP 7.9 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Differences between Afghanistan and Iraq" </p><p>Ferai Tinc wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (8/4): "The </p><p>establishment of the international security force in </p><p>Afghanistan, to which Turkey is one of the contributors, is </p><p>based on a genuine international consensus.  Moreover, this </p><p>force will soon be under a NATO umbrella.  . The case of </p><p>Iraq, as far as Turkey is concerned, presents a very </p><p>different picture from that in Afghanistan.  Unlike </p><p>Afghanistan, Turkey has not established a relationship with </p><p>all the Iraqi groups and clans on an equal basis.  For the </p><p>people of Iraq, Turkey represents both positive as well as </p><p>negative images.  Thus it is not possible to believe that </p><p>all of the Iraqi groups will happily accept a Turkish </p><p>presence in the peacekeeping mission.  A Turkish military </p><p>presence in Iraq must be implemented under an international </p><p>umbrella.  Otherwise, it will harm not only Turkey, but the </p><p>US as well." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Seeing the picture correctly" </p><p>Erdal Guven opined in the liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(8/3): "The main motive for the US military operation </p><p>against Iraq was neither the threat of WMD nor the link of </p><p>Iraq with international terrorism.  These are secondary </p><p>reasons.  The main reason stems from the US strategy to </p><p>stabilize the Middle East region, at least for the next </p><p>decade or so, to make it free from groups such as those who </p><p>organized the 9/11 attacks.  This strategy has become the </p><p>moving force behind US security considerations.  Afghanistan </p><p>was first on the list, Iraq was next, and there will be more </p><p>to come.  Currently the US priority is to stabilize Iraq </p><p>first, then provide the Iraqi people with both greater </p><p>welfare and more democracy.  Those who believe that this </p><p>plan will be invalid once the Bush administration is gone </p><p>are making a big mistake.  . Turkey is currently discussing </p><p>whether or not to send Turkish soldiers to Iraq.  Yet the </p><p>real issue is whether Turkey realizes that there is a </p><p>process underway to re-shape the Middle East." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
