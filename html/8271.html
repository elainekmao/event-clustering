<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000873 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, EUR/NB, EAP/J; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 05/27/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, EAID, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Norwegians set to try again with Tigers; </p><p>President criticizes the group\'s latest demands </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) OpsCenter-Colombo 05/24/03 telecon </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 868, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In the latest effort to convince the </p><p>Tigers to come to the Tokyo conference, a Norwegian </p><p>envoy is working with the GSL on ways to meet the </p><p>group\'s demands re control of assistance funds.  Sharply </p><p>curbing the GSL\'s room for compromise on the matter, the </p><p>president has harshly criticized the Tigers\' demand for </p><p>an interim structure in the north/east.  In other news, </p><p>the Tigers have been earning some rare plaudits for </p><p>their recent meeting with eastern Muslims and their </p><p>sending of flood aid to the south.  Although the GoN is </p><p>giving it another try, getting the Tigers to Tokyo still </p><p>seems a long shot.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) NORWEGIAN ENVOY ARRIVES:  Norwegian envoy </p><p>Erik Solheim arrived in Colombo on May 25 in the latest </p><p>effort to convince the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) to come to the Tokyo donors conference, which is </p><p>scheduled for June 9-10.  (Note:  The LTTE announced in </p><p>late April that it was pulling out of the peace talks </p><p>and would not go to Tokyo.  Since that time, Norwegian </p><p>and Japanese officials have been engaged in a full-court </p><p>press aimed at convincing the LTTE to reconsider.)  From </p><p>what Mission understands, Solheim was in close </p><p>consultation with GSL officials, including Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe, during the first part of his </p><p>visit.  The focus of these meetings was to fine-tune the </p><p>government\'s reaction to the latest LTTE demand that an </p><p>"interim administrative structure" be set up in the </p><p>north/east to distribute assistance funding.  (Note: </p><p>The LTTE demands that whatever structure is formed also </p><p>be basically under its control -- See Reftels.)  Solheim </p><p>is expected to take the GSL\'s counter-proposals to the </p><p>LTTE-controlled Wanni region soon and review them with </p><p>Tiger officials at that time.  (Note:  We have heard </p><p>late reports that the essence of the GSL\'s proposals </p><p>have already been provided to the LTTE and that Solheim </p><p>will review the details whenever he visits the Wanni.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) (((Note:  The GSL\'s exact counter-proposals have </p><p>not been publicized as of yet.  Per Septel, however, we </p><p>understand that the government is recommending to the </p><p>LTTE that a new entity be created to deal with all </p><p>aspects of development and reconstruction in the NE, </p><p>replacing the joint Sub-Committee on Immediate </p><p>Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs for the North and </p><p>East, "SIHRN."  The new entity would be quite complex, </p><p>with various units, including an "apex" council.  The </p><p>general idea is that the LTTE would have a "major" role </p><p>in the delivery of assistance in the NE, but not a </p><p>"majority" voice.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) (((Note:  The Department\'s May 23 announcement </p><p>that the Deputy Secretary would be attending Tokyo </p><p>received a great deal of press play in Sri Lanka.  Local </p><p>reaction was highly favorable.  A media reaction cable </p><p>is being sent Septel.))) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) PRESIDENT HITS OUT:  Sharply curbing the GSL\'s </p><p>room for compromise, the president has harshly </p><p>criticized the Tigers\' demand for an interim structure </p><p>in the north/east.  President Kumaratunga, addressing a </p><p>foreign correspondents\' dinner late May 23, flatly </p><p>rejected the Tiger demands for an interim administration </p><p>and stated:  "I have not heard of any self-respecting </p><p>sovereign government anywhere in the world agreeing to </p><p>act outside its own constitution at the request of </p><p>anyone."   The president went on to criticize the </p><p>Norwegian effort as going beyond facilitation and stated </p><p>that she did not know what Japan\'s exact role in the </p><p>process was.  The president\'s People\'s Alliance (PA) </p><p>party also hit out hard against the LTTE\'s demands and </p><p>starkly warned the PM about the matter, stating, "The PA </p><p>rejects totally the LTTE\'s demands and warns the Prime </p><p>Minister that if he continues, his government will be in </p><p>peril."  In the meantime, the radical, anti-peace </p><p>process Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party also </p><p>joined in the hue and cry, characterizing any attempt to </p><p>create an interim administration as nothing but a move </p><p>toward "Tamil Eelam" in disguise.  In its statement, the </p><p>JVP slammed the government, claiming that the GSL had </p><p>achieved nothing in its months of negotiations with the </p><p>LTTE, and accused "Western interests" of acting in </p><p>concert with the LTTE to "trap" the government. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) SOME POSITIVE NEWS RE THE LTTE:  Of late, most </p><p>reports regarding the LTTE\'s activities have been highly </p><p>negative.  (Note:  Much of the reporting, for example, </p><p>has focused on the group\'s pullout from the talks and </p><p>the Tokyo conference, and on clear indications that the </p><p>group is assassinating Tamil opponents, etc.)  There </p><p>have been some slight recent bright spots, however, </p><p>including the fact that local Tiger leaders met with </p><p>local Muslim leaders in the eastern town of Mutur on May </p><p>21.  (Note:  Mutur was the scene of serious communal </p><p>violence between pro-LTTE Tamils and Muslims in mid- </p><p>April.)  In a show of communal solidarity, the two sides </p><p>discussed ways to avoid conflict in the future, even </p><p>agreeing to form a committee on the matter.  (Note: </p><p>FYI.  Muslim leader Rauf Hakeem has reviewing peace </p><p>process issues with the Norwegian government in Oslo for </p><p>the past several days.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In other positive news re the LTTE, the Tigers </p><p>donated six truckloads of dry rations (rice, lentils, </p><p>etc.) to flood victims in the south on May 22.  LTTE </p><p>political wing officials accompanied the aid -- which </p><p>was reportedly worth about USD 35,000 -- on its trek to </p><p>the south.  This gesture netted significant (and rare) </p><p>positive press coverage for the LTTE in the south. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  Although the Norwegians are giving it </p><p>another try, getting the Tigers to Tokyo still appears a </p><p>long shot.  The pressure on the GSL is considerable, </p><p>with the LTTE setting tough conditions on one flank and </p><p>the president/JVP criticizing whatever the government </p><p>does on the other.  Coming up with a workable compromise </p><p>on aid delivery in the north/east that is politically </p><p>palatable in the south (and legal per Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>complex constitution) normally would take weeks and </p><p>months to work out.  It is certainly very, very </p><p>difficult to do so in several days.  All that said, the </p><p>fact that Tokyo is moving forward and that the U.S. will </p><p>be there has given the government more breathing space </p><p>to try to work things out.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
