<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001240 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MASS, LI, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LIBERIA DEMARCHE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 207082 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) A/DCM delivered reftel demarche July 18 to Foreign </p><p>Affairs Permanent Secretary Daniel Hart.  Ambassador Hart </p><p>said the USG position that the Nigerian contingent to be </p><p>deployed to Liberia should be comprised of battalions </p><p>trained under Operation Focus Relief (OFR) made "good </p><p>sense."  A/DCM Browne also expressed the need for as much </p><p>clarity as possible in the total number of troops ECOWAS </p><p>envisioned for the deployment and a precise breakdown of </p><p>how many troops were to come from ECOWAS countries and how </p><p>many were expected from outside ECOWAS.  A/DCM emphasized </p><p>to Hart that we had not made any decision on deployment of </p><p>U.S. troops or any other assistance we might supply to the </p><p>Liberian deployment, but that precise information on the </p><p>composition of the proposed force was vital to U.S. </p><p>planning.  Hart said he would contact us after conferring </p><p>with the Chief of Defense Staff on both issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Finally, Ambassador Hart agreed all ECOWAS states </p><p>must stop the flow of arms to Liberia and must exert </p><p>pressure on the LURD and MODEL not to take action that </p><p>would damage the cease-fire.  He stated that the reason </p><p>underlying President Obasanjo\'s recent visit to Conakry was </p><p>to persuade the Guineans to use their influence to </p><p>encourage the LURD behave responsibly.  He recognized that </p><p>fellow ECOWAS states must mount a sustained effort to </p><p>preach this message to Conakry as well as to Abidjan with </p><p>regard to Liberia\'s other anti-Taylor faction, MODEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Discussion of recent developments in Sao Tome and </p><p>Principe to be reported SEPTEL. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
