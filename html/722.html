<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUALA LUMPUR 001919 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EAP/PIMBS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, MY </p><p>SUBJECT:  TIME UPSETS MAHATHIR </p><p> </p><p>1.  PRIME MINISTER MAHATHIR RESPONDED WITH ANTI-WEST </p><p>RHETORIC TO AN ARTICLE IN THE APRIL 10 ISSUE OF TIME </p><p>MAGAZINE WHICH ALLEGED THAT ABU SAYYAF, A SMALL MUSLIM </p><p>EXTREMIST GROUP BASED IN THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES, WAS </p><p>RECEIVING ARMS, MONEY AND TRAINING FROM ISLAMIC GROUPS </p><p>IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES INCLUDING MALAYSIA.  THE ARTICLE </p><p>ALSO REPORTED THAT "THE GROUP USES TRAINING CAMPS IN </p><p>MALAYSIA AND IS EXPECTING ARMS SHIPMENTS FROM </p><p>SUPPORTERS THERE."  THE PRIME MINISTER DESCRIBED THE </p><p>PIECE AS A "PART OF A CAMPAIGN BY THE WESTERN MEDIA TO </p><p>DISCREDIT MALAYSIA" TO "DETER PEOPLE FROM INVESTING </p><p>AND VISITING HERE, GENERALLY AIMED AT UNDERMINING THE </p><p>NATION\'S ECONOMY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT."  PEOPLE UNHAPPY </p><p>WITH MALAYSIA\'S "VOCIFEROUS" STAND ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ISSUES, HE EXPLAINED, WERE BEHIND THE WESTERN MEDIA\'S </p><p>CONSPIRACY.  HE ALSO CONFIDENTLY CHALLENGED TIME TO </p><p>"COME TO MALAYSIA AND MAKE A REPORT HERE" THAT </p><p>MALAYSIA IS TRAINING TERRORISTS.  THE INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER ECHOED THE PM\'S LINE.  NO ONE FROM THE GOM </p><p>HAS FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE </p><p>ARTICLE TO US.  SEVERAL OF OUR MALAYSIAN CONTACTS ARE </p><p>CURIOUS ABOUT THE STORY -- THEY WANT TO KNOW IF IT\'S </p><p>TRUE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENT:  MAHATHIR WAS STILL ANXIOUS ABOUT THE </p><p>NEGATIVE IMPACT OF A RECENT FORTUNE ARTICLE WHICH </p><p>DESCRIBED THE MALAYSIAN CURRENCY AS AT RISK </p><p>POST-MEXICO, WHEN THE TIME PIECE CAME OUT.  HE ORDERED </p><p>A DELAY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TIME ISSUE BUT DID </p><p>NOT BAN IT.  (OBSERVERS EXPECT THE MAGAZINE WILL BE </p><p>ALLOWED ON THE SHELVES IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.)  WITH </p><p>THE GENERAL ELECTION JUST AROUND THE CORNER, HIS </p><p>RHETORIC WAS VERY MUCH EXPECTED SINCE CONSPIRACY </p><p>THEORIES STILL HAVE A FOLLOWING HERE.  HOWEVER, AS </p><p>COMPARED TO HIS PREVIOUS BOUTS WITH WESTERN MEDIA </p><p>(MOST NOTABLY, DENYING CONTRACTS TO BRITISH FIRMS IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO AN UNFLATTERING ARTICLE IN THE BRITISH </p><p>PRESS), THE PM\'S REACTION TO FORTUNE AND NOW TIME </p><p>PIECES HAS BEEN MODERATE AND APPARENTLY SHORT LIVED. </p><p>THERE MAY BE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS.  DIFFERENT FROM </p><p>PREVIOUS CASES, MAHATHIR WAS NOT PERSONALLY MENTIONED </p><p>IN THE STORIES.  FURTHER, THE LAST TWO ANTI-BRITISH </p><p>AND ANTI-AUSTRALIAN OUTINGS HAVE NOT BEEN VIEWED AS </p><p>CLEAR-CUT VICTORIES FOR THE PM.  FINALLY, GIVEN THE </p><p>MURKY GENERAL HISTORY OF MORO-MALAYSIAN DEALINGS, HE </p><p>MAY FEEL IT BEST NOT TO GO INTO TOO MANY DETAILS.  THE </p><p>FACT THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED ALMOST NO QUERIES FROM THE </p><p>PRESS IS FURTHER INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES </p><p>NOT WISH TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF THIS AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHAMBERLIN </p><p></p></div>
