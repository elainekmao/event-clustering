(C) ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ANOTHER OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>CABINET HOLDS THE PRESIDENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S MALAISE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. INTRODUCTION:  OVER LUNCH DECEMBER 19, ABDIRAHMAN </p><p>JAMA MOHAMED, MINISTER OF LIVESTOCK,FORESTRY AND RANGE, </p><p>IDENTIFIED PRESIDENT SIAD BARRE AS THE PRINCIPAL STUMBLING </p><p>BLOCK TO PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF SOMALIA\'S MOUNTING </p><p>POLITICAL TURMOIL.  AN ISSAK FROM HARGESIA, THE </p><p>YOUTHFUL MINISTER WARMLY BUT PRIVATELY ENDORSED FORMER </p><p>PRIME MINISTER MOHAMMED EGAL\'S PUBLIC CALL THIS WEEK </p><p>FOR SIAD\'S RESIGNATION.  ABDIRAHMAN SAID HE FOUND EGAL\'S </p><p>PROPOSED SUCCESSION SCENARIO QUITE REASONABLE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>WHEN ASKED IF HE THOUGHT SIAD BARRE WOULD AGREE TO </p><p>STEP DOWN, ABDIRAHMAN SHOOK HIS HEAD SLOWLY AND SADLY. </p><p>ASKED WHAT PROCEDURE CURRENTLY EXISTS FOR PEACEFUL </p><p>RESOLUTION OF OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE REGIME </p><p>AND THE REBELS, THE MINISTER SAID SOURCES WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT STATE THAT THE CAIRO ROUNDTABLE HAS BEEN </p><p>RESCHEDULED FOR MID-JANUARY.  I THEN BRIEFED HIM ON MY </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH THE EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR, WHO TOLD ME </p><p>THAT NO NEW DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR THE PUTATIVE TALKS </p><p>IN THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  CAIRO CONFERENCE:  IN DISCUSSING THE POSTPONEMENT OF </p><p>THE MEETING IN CAIRO, THE MINISTER SAID THE ORDERS TO </p><p>ARREST THE MANIFESTO GROUP MEMBERS CAME DIRECTLY FROM </p><p>SIAD.  HE WAS ANGRY WHEN HE DISCOVERED THEY INTENDED TO </p><p>CONSULT WITH THE SNM IN LONDON EN ROUTE TO CAIRO.  WHEN </p><p>IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TWO GROUPS </p><p>CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE MET IN CAIRO AND THAT SENIOR GSDR </p><p>OFFICIALS ROUTINELY CONTACT SENIOR SNM OFFICIALS WHEN </p><p>IN LONDON, ABDIRAHMAN SMILED WEAKLY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5. VIOLENCE:  IN AN EXCHANGE ON THE VIOLENCE WHICH HAS </p><p>PROMPTED THE EVACUATION OF SO MANY FOREIGN ASSISTANCE </p><p>PERSONNEL, THE MINISTER BLAMED THE SOMALI MILITARY FOR </p><p>THE ONGOING MURDERS AND ROBBERIES.  HE OPINED THAT THE </p><p>DETACHMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR SIAD\'S PROTECTION, NOW </p><p>COMPOSED SOLELY OF MAREHAN TRIBE MEMBERS, SEES THE END </p><p>OF THE REGIME AND THEIR OWN PROTECTED STATUS COMING. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, THEY ARE TRYING TO BUILD UP PERSONAL </p><p>FINANCIAL RESERVES BY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.  HE CLAIMED </p><p>THAT EVEN SIAD BARRE HAS HAD PERSONAL VEHICLES STOLEN </p><p>BY SOLDIERS ASSIGNED TO GUARD HIM.  THE MINISTER SUBSE- </p><p>QUENTLY REQUESTED MY ASSISTANCE OBTAINING VISAS FOR </p><p>YOUNG RELATIVES HE WANTED TO HELP LEAVE SOMALIA TO AVOID </p><p>BOTH VIOLENCE AND BEING IMPRESSED INTO THE SOMALI </p><p>NATIONAL ARMY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6. AID SUSPENSION:  ABDIRAHMAN TOOK THE OCCASION TO WARN </p><p>ME THAT MANY SENIOR MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT HOLD ME PER- </p><p>SONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUSPENSION OF AMERICAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE, WHICH THEY CONSIDER AN OVER-REACTION TO THE </p><p>ONGOING VIOLENCE.  HIS ACCOUNT WAS SIMILAR TO THAT GIVEN </p><p>ME A FEW DAYS EARLIER BY THE MINISTER OF MINERAL RESOURCES </p><p>(REFTEL C).  HE ADVISED ME TO SEE THE PRIME MINISTER TO </p><p>TRY TO CLEAR THE AIR. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7. NATIONAL PROSPECTS:  THE MINISTER\'S DOWNBEAT </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT SCENE GAVE RISE TO EVIDENT </p><p>PESSIMISM ABOUT SOMALIA\'S FUTURE.  HE RULED OUT </p><p>FEDERALISM AS INCONSISTENT WITH SOMALIA\'S POVERTY, </p><p>FACTIONALISM AND THE NOMADIC LIFESTYLE OF MOST OF ITS </p><p>PEOPLE.  BUT HE RELENTED WHEN IT WAS NOTED THAT </p><p>FEDERALISM COULD MEAN NO MORE THAN TWO FEDERATED POLITICAL </p><p>UNITS.  HE HAD PRESUMED IT MUST ENTAIL THE ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF ELABORATE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES IN EACH OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S 20 REGIONS.  HE DID STATE HIS BELIEF THAT BOTH </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER AND FINANCE MINISTER JAMA BARRE HAVE </p><p>NATIONAL INTERESTS AT HEART, AND HE URGED THAT I WORK </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THEM. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:  IN REVIEWING WHAT DIVIDES </p><p>SOMALIS, THE MINISTER FOCUSED ON THE DIFFERENT VALUE </p><p>SYSTEMS TO WHICH SOMALIS WERE EXPOSED IN BRITISH AND </p><p>ITALIAN ADMINISTERED SOMALIA.  NORTHERNERS FIND IT </p><p>IRKSOME, HE UNDERLINED, TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOUTHERNERS, </p><p>BECAUSE THEY APE THE ITALIANS\' CORRUPTION, INCOMPETENCE, </p><p>AND TOLERANCE FOR SHODDY WORK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
