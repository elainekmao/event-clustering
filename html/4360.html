(U) SUMMARY: Parliament resumed November 12 after a </p><p>3-week adjournment and Government ministers took advantage of </p><p>the opportunity to turn up the heat on groups it accuses of </p><p>supporting the opposition, such as Amani Trust and SW Radio </p><p>Africa.  The actions suggest ZANU-PF is forging ahead in its </p><p>bid to re-create a one-party state.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT TRYING TO CRUSH DISSENTING VIEWS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (U) Parliament resumed on November 12 with ZANU-PF </p><p>ministers stepping up attacks on groups it accuses of </p><p>supporting the opposition.  The Government has been </p><p>threatening NGOs since mid-September, when it issued a note </p><p>for all NGOs to register with the Ministry of Social </p><p>Welfare--in compliance with the Private Voluntary </p><p>Organizations Act (PVO)--or cease operations.  The GOZ has </p><p>taken particular interest in NGOs it perceives to be hostile </p><p>to ZANU-PF.  The state-controlled newspaper, The Herald, </p><p>criticized Amani Trust, a prominent human rights organization </p><p>that counsels torture victims and publicizes human rights </p><p>violations, several times in October, most recently accusing </p><p>it of being illegal. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In the November 12 parliamentary session, Minister of </p><p>Public Service, Labor, and Social Welfare, July Moyo, said </p><p>Amani Trust was not properly registered and its leadership </p><p>risked being arrested.  Minister of State Security, Nicholas </p><p>Goche, chimed in that Amani Trust, as well as Westminster </p><p>Foundation for Democracy, Zimbabwe Democracy Trust, and </p><p>Southern Africa Media Development Fund, was engaging in </p><p>activities intended to unseat the government. Patrick </p><p>Chinamasa, Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary </p><p>Affairs, defended the GOZ decision to list Zimbabwean </p><p>citizens among the sanctions list of people banned from </p><p>visiting Zimbabwe.  On November 8, The Herald published a </p><p>list of people prohibited from entering the country.  Seven </p><p>people from SW Radio Africa--an independent radio station </p><p>that broadcasts out of London--were on the list.  Chinamasa </p><p>told Parliamentarians that Zimbabweans on the list would be </p><p>arrested if they came back to Zimbabwe saying, &we cannot </p><p>have these people demonizing the government every day on the </p><p>radio...They will be welcome in our prisons." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Brian Raftopoulos, a political commentator at the </p><p>University of Zimbabwe, said the trend is clearly towards a </p><p>one-party state.  The GOZ decision to ban Zimbabweans from </p><p>freely coming back home could be a precursor to increased </p><p>internal migration restrictions.  Raftopoulos said the GOZ </p><p>could begin restricting people from leaving the country also. </p><p> Regarding GOZ plans to enforce the PVO Act, Raftopoulos said </p><p>the GOZ seems to be stepping up its efforts to rid the </p><p>country of human rights and democracy NGOs and civic groups. </p><p>Raftopoulos said some civic groups are developing contingency </p><p>plans in case the GOZ forces them to cease operations. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT: Through its parliamentary majority, ZANU-PF </p><p>seems to be consolidating its power by passing more </p><p>restrictive legislation and recent GOZ rhetoric suggest </p><p>certain NGOs are the next imminent targets.  The decision to </p><p>ban from the country Zimbabweans who criticize the Government </p><p>seems to be a particularly egregious step, and we would </p><p>appreciate Department\'s guidance on whether it violates any </p><p>international agreements to which Zimbabwe is a party. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
