OF THOSE THAT DID, </p><p>COMMENTATORS CRITICIZED REPORTS THAT THE U.S. WOULD </p><p>RESUME THE INTERCEPTION OF SHIPS IN AND OUT OF AQABA, </p><p>AND THE U.S. DOMINATION OF THE UN.  ONE EDITORIALIST </p><p>ADVISED PALESTINIANS NOT TO RETALIATE AGAINST THE </p><p>ISRAELI RAID ON GAZA BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE SWALLOWING </p><p>SHARON\'S BAIT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWS REPORTS </p><p> </p><p>THE LEAD STORY IN ALL JORDANIAN DAILIES ON JULY 29 WAS </p><p>KING ABDULLAH\'S INTERVIEW WITH CNN AFTER HIS MEETING </p><p>WITH THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER AND BEFORE HIS MEETING </p><p>WITH PRESIDENT BUSH.  THE NEWSPAPERS HIGHLIGHTED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING QUOTES: </p><p>-  DIALOGUE IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE WAY TO DEAL WITH THE </p><p>IRAQI SITUATION </p><p>-  WE HAVE NOT AND WILL NOT DISCUSS WITH THE U.S. THE </p><p>USE OF JORDANIAN TERRITORY FOR A STRIKE AGAINST IRAQ </p><p>-  WE HAVE RECEIVED AN APOLOGY FROM U.S. OFFICIALS FOR </p><p>CIRCULATING RUMORS ABOUT THE USE OF JORDANIAN TERRITORY </p><p>FOR MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ </p><p>-  WE ARE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GETTING INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>WEST BANK BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO SEND THE WRONG </p><p>MESSAGE </p><p>-  PALESTINIANS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE CONCERNED WITH </p><p>THEIR POLITICAL OPTIONS AND THEY SHOULD DECIDE THEIR </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALL DAILIES CARRIED ON THEIR FRONT PAGES AGENCY REPORTS </p><p>THAT IRAQ HAS MADE PREPARATIONS TO CONFRONT THE </p><p>"AMERICAN AGGRESSION." </p><p> </p><p>SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI PLAYED </p><p>DOWN, WHILE OTHER DAILIES REPORTED ON THE FRONT PAGES </p><p>REPORTS ABOUT THE ISRAELI ATTACK ON HEBRON, UNDER </p><p>HEADLINES SUCH AS: "ISRAEL TERRORISM SACKS HEBRON." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SIEGE OF AQABA AGAIN </p><p>LEADING JORDANIAN DAILY COLUMNIST FAHED AL-FANEK WROTE </p><p>IN SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON </p><p>JULY 29: "THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THE U.S. RED SEA FLEET </p><p>PLANS TO REINSTATE THE SIEGE ON AQABA, GIVING ITSELF </p><p>THE RIGHT TO INTERCEPT AND SEARCH SHIPS ENTERING OR </p><p>LEAVING THE PORT TO ASSURE THAT THE RULES OF THE SIEGE </p><p>ON IRAQ ARE RESPECTED. IF TRUE, THIS STUPID AMERICAN </p><p>DECISION DESERVES THE STRONGEST CONDEMNATION BECAUSE IT </p><p>MEANS THAT THE U.S., DOES NOT TRUST JORDAN DESPITE THE </p><p>LATTER\'S RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL RESOLUTIONS, UNJUST </p><p>THOUGH THEY ARE.  TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, WE DO NOT SEE </p><p>THE U.S. IMPOSE A SIMILAR SIEGE ON THE PORTS OF SYRIA, </p><p>TURKEY, IRAN, OR THE EMIRATES.  IT SINGLES OUT JORDAN, </p><p>WHICH SHOWS DISRESPECT FOR THIS COUNTRY\'S SOVEREIGNTY." </p><p> </p><p>-- SHARON BOMBED A READY PALESTINIAN SECURITY PLAN </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST SULTAN HATTAB WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY 29: "WHEN </p><p>EXTREMIST ELEMENTS IN ISRAEL LEARNED THAT THERE WAS A </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF THE SUCCESS OF THE PALESTINIAN PLAN THAT </p><p>WAS WORKED OUT UNDER ARAB AND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, </p><p>AND WITH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INTERNATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>AGENCIES, THESE ISRAELI AGENCIES, WITH THE COLLUSION OF </p><p>SHARON, WORKED TO ABORT THE PLAN BY CONDUCTING THE RAID </p><p>ON GAZA.  SHARON NOW WANTS MORE ISRAELIS TO BE KILLED, </p><p>AND HE WANTS PALESTINIAN RETALIATIONS, THE SEEDS OF </p><p>WHICH HE SOWS BY HIS AGGRESSION, BECAUSE THIS PROLONGS </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT\'S LEASE OF LIFE AND THE CONTINUATION OF </p><p>HIS PLANS OF USURPING PALESTINIAN RIGHTS AND PREVENTING </p><p>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PALESTINIAN STATE." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UN, OWNED BY THE U.S. </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MAZEN AL-SAKET WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON JULY 29: "WHEN </p><p>COUNTRIES DECLARE THEMSELVES OPPOSED TO MILITARY ACTION </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ, AND OUT OF FEAR OF THEIR AMERICAN MASTERS </p><p>THEY SHYLY HIDE BEHIND THE LACK OF A UN RESOLUTION, THE </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THIS ORGANIZATION HASTENS TO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SUSPEND TALKS WITH IRAQ.  AFTER THE ISRAELI MASSACRE IN </p><p>GAZA, THE U.S. LAID A CONDITION TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>THAT ANY RESOLUTION ON THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE SHOULD </p><p>CONDEMN PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE AND DESCRIBE IT AS </p><p>TERRORISM.
