<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000067 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EU, IT, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: THERE HE GOES AGAIN:  WHITHER RUGGIERO, II? </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2001 ROME 6573 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM WILLIAM P. POPE, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ITALY\'S FOREIGN MINISTER HAS AGAIN </p><p>GENERATED TURMOIL BY PUBLICLY CHASTISING HIS FELLOW CABINET </p><p></p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00067  070638Z </p><p>MEMBERS -- AND SOME SUGGEST EVEN HIS PRIME MINISTER -- FOR </p><p>FAILING TO BE SUFFICIENTLY VOCAL IN THEIR SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>LAUNCH OF THE EURO.  IS RUGGIERO SEEKING HIS OWN PREMATURE </p><p>OUSTER?  IS HE SIMPLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE GOI REMAINS </p><p>FIRMLY ON THE EU TRACK IN PREPARATION FOR ITS UPCOMING TURN </p><p>AT THE PRESIDENCY?  WE AREN\'T SURE WHAT RUGGIERO IS UP TO, </p><p>BUT FOR THE TIME BEING IT APPEARS PM BERLUSCONI HAS CHOSEN TO </p><p>KEEP PEACE IN THE FAMILY, AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE </p><p>STRONGEST FEELINGS TO DIE DOWN.  HE HAS, HOWEVER, SUMMONED </p><p>RUGGIERO FOR A "TETE-A-TETE" ON JANUARY 7.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  ITALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER RENATO RUGGIERO HAS AGAIN </p><p>SPOKEN OUT FRANKLY -- TOO FRANKLY FOR THE LIKING OF SOME OF </p><p>HIS MINISTERIAL COLLEAGUES.  RUGGIERO WAS WIDELY QUOTED IN </p><p>THE MEDIA FOLLOWING THE INAUGURATION OF THE EURO AS </p><p>CRITICIZING NOT ONLY HIS FELLOW CABINET MEMBERS, BUT EVEN </p><p>(THIS INDIRECT "CRITICISM" IS OPEN TO INTERPRETATION) PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI AS BEING LUKEWARM IN THEIR SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>EURO AND THUS IN THEIR SUPPORT OF EUROPE.  RUGGIERO\'S </p><p>STATEMENTS DREW THE IMMEDIATE IRE OF, ESPECIALLY, FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER TREMONTI (FORZA ITALIA), MINISTER FOR DEVOLUTION </p><p>BOSSI (LEGA NORD), AND MINISTER FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS </p><p>BUTTIGLIONE (CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION).  BOSSI INTENSIFIED </p><p>HIS (RELATIVELY) MILD COMMENTS REPORTED REFTEL CALLING </p><p>RUGGIERO A "PROVOCATEUR, REPRESENTING BUREAUCRATS AND </p><p>TYRANTS, WITH A FATAL ATTRACTION FOR THE LEFT." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  FOR THE TIME BEING, BERLUSCONI POURED OIL ON THE </p><p>TROUBLED WATERS AND DECLINED TO CRITICIZE HIS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER.  HIS SPOKESPERSON NOTED THAT DISSENT AND </p><p>CONTROVERSY ARE HEALTHY IN A GOVERNMENT.  THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>STATED, HOWEVER, THAT HE CONTROLS ITALY\'S FOREIGN POLICY, </p><p>THAT HE IS THE GUARANTOR OF THE COUNTRY\'S POLITICAL </p><p>DIRECTION, AND THAT AS SUCH HE ASSURES THERE IS CONTINUITY IN </p><p>THE GOI TOWARD EUROPE.  BERLUSCONI DENIED THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT SOMETHING SAID BY RUGGIERO, WHOM HE DEFINED AS A </p><p>"TECHNOCRATIC MINISTER," COULD HAVE POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS </p><p>AND DECLINED TO SPECULATE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGES IN </p><p>HIS CABINET.  FINALLY, BERLUSCONI ANNOUNCED THAT HE AND </p><p>RUGGIERO WOULD MEET ON JANUARY 7, WHEN THEY WOULD "CLARIFY </p><p>EVERYTHING." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  NATURALLY, SPECULATION ON RUGGIERO\'S INTENT IS </p><p>RAMPANT.  SOME SPECULATE THAT HE IS ANGLING TO GET OUT OF HIS </p><p>18-MONTH COMMITMENT AS MINISTER AND MOVE ON TO SOMETHING </p><p>ELSE.  (ONE JOURNALIST EVEN SUGGESTED RUGGIERO NOW WANTS TO </p><p>BECOME A UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE IN AFGHANISTAN.)  OTHERS </p><p>SUGGEST THE FOREIGN MINISTER IS SIMPLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>THE GOI STAYS FIRMLY PLACED ON THE EU TRACK, READYING IT TO </p><p>FULFILL ITS ROLE IN THE PRESIDENCY, SOMETHING THAT TRACKS </p><p>MORE CLOSELY WITH RUGGIERO\'S OWN COMMENTS.  THERE ARE ALSO </p><p>THEORIES -- MAINLY AMONG RIGHT-WINGERS -- OF A LEFTIST PLOT </p><p>TO "CAPTURE" THE FOREIGN MINISTRY (OR MORE). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  WE AREN\'T YET READY TO PULL OUT OUR </p><p>CRYSTAL BALL ON RUGGIERO\'S FUTURE.  HIS STATEMENTS DON\'T </p><p>STRIKE US AS ALL THAT EXTREME, BUT ANY PUBLIC CRITICISM OF </p><p>ONE\'S OWN GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER HOW MILD, IS CORROSIVE. </p><p>WE\'LL STAY TUNED FOR MONDAY\'S MEETING. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002ROME00067 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
