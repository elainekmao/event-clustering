<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001666 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PDA (JGREENBLATT); WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON DRUG TRAFFICKING, JULY 12, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Op-ed by Guillermo Castellanos Enamorado on Tegucigalpa-based </p><p>moderate daily "El Heraldo" on 7/12 entitled "Narco trafficking </p><p>and Congressmen". "The cases of the member of the Central </p><p>American Parliament detained in Nicaragua and the Honduran </p><p>Congressman arrested in Olancho have brought forward once again </p><p>the declarations made by the US Ambassador Larry Palmer, who </p><p>stated that he hasn\'t seen any `powerful figure\' being prosecuted </p><p>for any crime and that it is the duty of the proper authorities </p><p>to investigate the authenticity of any report on drug </p><p>trafficking". </p><p> </p><p>"Among the `powerful\' Mr. Palmer refers to, besides Congressmen, </p><p>we can find ministers, high-ranking public officials, executive </p><p>directors of decentralized institutions and other big fish that I </p><p>have no idea of who can also be drug carriers for narco </p><p>traffickers." </p><p> </p><p>"How is it possible that such people can become members of </p><p>National Congress or of that white elephant called the Central </p><p>American Parliament? Even though we already knew that this </p><p>institution has become the safe haven for the debris of the </p><p>Central American political elites". </p><p> </p><p>"Anyway, I still wonder, how do these people sneak in? Is it </p><p>possible that the political parties don\'t check and re-check the </p><p>kind of people they include in their electoral ballots?" </p><p> </p><p>"For these and many more other reasons, it is urgent to approve </p><p>the political reforms promised by the political parties during </p><p>the last electoral campaign, to create effective mechanisms to </p><p>avoid these scandals in the future." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
