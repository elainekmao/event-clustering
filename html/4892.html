(S)  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS POSED IN REF A, ROLES AND </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE U.N.

WFP PLAYS AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN </p><p>THE SYSTEM IN THE NORTH AND PROVIDES OVERSIGHT IN </p><p>SOUTH/CENTRAL, BUT IT IS A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM.  ESTIMATES ARE </p><p>GIVEN FOR STOCKPILES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, ALBEIT </p><p>SKETCHY FOR THE INSIDE.  WFP HAS VERY LITTLE EQUIPMENT/ASSETS </p><p>OF ITS OWN IN IRAQ.

(S)  AS REPORTED IN REF C, WFP PLAYS A MUCH GREATER ROLE </p><p>IN THE NORTH THAN IN THE SOUTH/CENTRAL REGIONS, BUT EVEN IN </p><p>THE NORTH, WFP IS NOT IN CONTROL OF THE ENTIRE OPERATION.  IN </p><p>THE NORTH, WFP MANAGES THE EXTENDED DELIVERY POINT (EDP) </p><p>WAREHOUSES IN DAHUK, ARBIL, AND SULAYMANIAH, CONTRACTS FOR </p><p>THE TRUCKING FROM THE TRANSIT WAREHOUSES IN MOSUL AND KIRKUK </p><p>TO THE NORTH AND THE TRUCKS FROM THE EDPS TO THE FOOD/FLOUR </p><p>AGENTS, AND MAINTAINS THE DATABASE OF BENEFICIARIES.  AS IT </p><p>DOES IN SOUTH/CENTRAL, WFP ALSO OBSERVES ALL LOADING OF </p><p>COMMODITIES, CHECKS THE BOOKS OF THE FOOD/FLOUR AGENTS, </p><p>OVERSEES THE DISTRIBUTIONS, AND CONDUCTS POST-DISTRIBUTION </p><p>MONITORING IN THE HOUSEHOLDS.  IN NONE/NONE OF THE COUNTRY, </p><p>DOES WFP DECIDE THE DATES OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS, MAKE TENDERS </p><p>FOR FOOD PURCHASES, CONTRACT OUTSIDE TRANSPORT, PLAY ANY ROLE </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06153  01 OF 05  301327Z </p><p>IN THE MILLING OPERATION (OTHER THAN OVERSEEING IT), WORK </p><p>WITH ANY NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) FOR THE </p><p>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION, DO ANY DISTRIBUTIONS--EVEN IN THE </p><p>NORTH, OR MANAGE THE FOOD PIPELINE.  THE MOT PERFORMS ALL THE </p><p>TASKS THAT WFP DOES NOT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE MOT SERVES AS THE INTERNATIONAL PROCUREMENT AGENT </p><p>FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND ARRANGES FOR THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TRANSPORT OF COMMODITIES.

(S) WFP ESTIMATES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THERE IS </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 450,000 METRIC TONS (MT), WHICH IS ALMOST </p><p>ENOUGH TO CONDUCT ONE MONTH\'S DISTRIBUTION.  TOTAL TONNAGE </p><p>DISTRIBUTED PER MONTH IN THE NORTH IS 50,000-60,000 MT PER </p><p>MONTH AND IN THE SOUTH/CENTRAL REGIONS IS 400,000-420,000 MT </p><p>PER MONTH, TOTALING 25.8 MILLION BENEFICIARIES IN NOVEMBER. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06153  02 OF 05  301328Z </p><p>WFP\'S EDP WAREHOUSES IN THE NORTH ARE RATHER SMALL.  THE </p><p>DAHUK WAREHOUSE HOLDS ONLY 3,000-4,000 MT, THE ONE IN ARBIL </p><p>IS A BIT LARGER, AND THE ONE IN SULAYMANIAH CAN STOCK FOR ONE </p><p>MONTH.  THIS MEANS THE NORTH CANNOT/CANNOT CURRENTLY STORE </p><p>EVEN ONE MONTH\'S OF FOOD.  SINCE A TWO-MONTH DISTRIBUTION WAS </p><p>GIVEN IN DECEMBER (FOR FEBRUARY AND MARCH), WFP REPORTS THE </p><p>WAREHOUSES CURRENTLY HAVE VERY LITTLE.  TEA AND SUGAR </p><p>PRIMARILY. </p><p> </p><p>   B.  (C) WFP ALSO RELAYED THAT IT NEVER/NEVER STORES WHEAT </p><p>FLOUR IN THE NORTH, AS IT IS TRANSPORTED DIRECTLY FROM THE </p><p>MILLS IN MOSUL AND/OR KIRKUK TO THE EDP POINTS, WHERE IT IS </p><p>TRANS-SHIPPED ONTO SMALLER TRUCKS WITH THE OTHER COMMODITIES </p><p>FOR DELIVERY TO THE  FOOD/FLOUR AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>   C.  (C) OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, WFP HAS OVER 6,000 MT </p><p>BISCUITS STORED IN TURKEY AND 3,000 MT RICE THAT WILL BE </p><p>STORED IN JORDAN (ON ITS WAY FROM VIET NAM).  THESE FOODS ARE </p><p>FOR WFP\'S NUTRITIONAL PROJECT (PRRO 6085 - WHICH ENDS JUNE </p><p>30, 2003) BUT WFP HAS PURCHASED A LARGER QUANTITY AS A </p><p>CONTINGENCY MEASURE.  WFP HAS PUT INTO PLACE NOW ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>WITH SYRIA TO BORROW 40,000 MT OF WHEAT FORM ITS NATIONAL </p><p>STOCKS.  A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE WITH A </p><p>PARASTATAL IN TURKEY FOR 4,000 MT WHEAT.  DISCUSSIONS </p><p>CONTINUE WITH THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT REGARDING LOANS OF </p><p>WHEAT.  WFP ALSO SIGNED A LETTER OF INTENT WITH THE IRAN RED </p><p>CRESCENT WHEREBY IT AGREED TO PROVIDE A FULL RATION TO </p><p>250,000 PEOPLE FOR ONE MONTH.  WFP\'S EMERGENCY OPERATION </p><p>(EMOP) FOR IRAQ WAS SIGNED ON DECEMBER 23.  IT REQUESTS </p><p>PULSES AND OIL, WHICH WOULD COMPLEMENT THE WHEAT LOANS, FOR </p><p>900,000 BENEFICIARIES FOR TEN WEEKS. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06153  02 OF 05  301328Z </p><p> </p><p>D.  (C) IN THE NORTH, WFP CONTROLS ACCESS TO THE THREE </p><p>WAREHOUSES IN THE NORTH; THE MOT CONTROLS ACCESS TO ALL OTHER </p><p>WAREHOUSES, MILLS, AND SILOS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) QUESTION 3.2 IN REF A.  WHO CONTROLS THE COMPILATION </p><p>OF, AND ACCESS TO, THE BENFICIARY RATION LISTS?  WFP </p><p>MAINTAINS THE BENEFICIARY DATABASE IN THE NORTH AND THE MOT </p><p>MAINTAINS THE LISTS FOR SOUTH/CENTRAL.  WITH THAT SAID, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE MOT EXERTS CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.  AS </p><p>REPORTED IN REF B, THE GOI IS CURRENTLY EXPELLING KURDS FROM </p><p>THE KIRKUK AREA AND SENDING THEM NORTH.  WFP IS INTERVENING </p><p>WITH THE MOT ON THE KURDS\' BEHALF TO HAVE THE DISPLACED </p><p>KURDS\' NAMES REMOVED FROM THE GOI FOOD DISTRIBUTION LISTS IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL REGION SO THEY CAN BE ADDED TO WFP\'S LISTS IN THE </p><p>NORTH.  AND AS STATED ABOVE, THE MOT DETERMINES THE NORTH\'S </p><p>MONTHLY FOOD SHIPMENT BASED ON THE LISTS.  IF WFP ADDED THE </p><p>DISPLACED KURDS TO ITS LISTS WITHOUT NOTIFYING THE MOT, WFP </p><p>WOULD NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH RATIONS FOR ALL BENEFICIARIES. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET        PTQ4265 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  06153  03 OF 05  301329Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00  L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      NEA-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00   SAS-00   SWCI-00    /004W </p><p>                  ------------------1E161F  301329Z /07 </p><p>O 301137Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7513 </p><p>AMEMBASSY AMMAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERLIN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KUWAIT </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>COMJSOC FT BRAGG NC//J2// </p><p>COMJSOC FT BRAGG NC </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3037 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06153  03 OF 05  301329Z </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T SECTION 03 OF 05 ROME 006153 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>JOINT STAFF FOR JE/J4/J5 </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, EUR/WE, EUR/NE, SA/INS, IO/EDA </p><p>USAID FOR A/AID, AA/DCHA, DCHA/OFDA, DCHA/FFP, AA/ANE, </p><p>PPC/DP, PPC/DC </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEU </p><p>USUN FOR MLUTZ </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAGR, EAID, KUNR, PHUM, PREF, WFP </p><p>SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING WFP AND FOOD </p><p>DISTRIBUTION IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>LOGISTICS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  QUESTION 3.3. PART ONE.  WHAT ASSESTS/FACILITIES </p><p>DOES THE UN OWN IN IRAQ THAT ARE USED BY WFP?  WHAT </p><p>IRAQI-OWNED FACILITIES/ASSETS ARE USED FOR WFP?  COULD </p><p>REPLACEMENTS BE FOUND?  THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OR THE MOT OWN </p><p>EVERYTHING THAT WFP USES EXCEPT FOR WFP\'S STAFF VEHICLES AND </p><p>COMPUTERS AND OTHER GENERAL OFFICE EQUIPMENT.

IS ACCESS TO THE WFP DELIVERY </p><p>AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, WAREHOUSES, AND FOOD/FLOUR AGENTS </p><p>LIKELY TO BE AVAILABLE TO INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES </p><p>IN A POST-CONFLICT ENVIRONMENT?   AS STATED IN REF TELS, </p><p>THERE IS NO/NO WFP DELIVERY AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. THERE </p><p>IS ONLY THE MOT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, TO WHICH WFP PROVIDES </p><p>OVERSIGHT IN SOUTH/CENTRAL, AND PLAYS A MORE INTEGRAL ROLE IN </p><p>THE NORTH.  PLEASE SEE PARA 2 ABOVE.  THE WAREHOUSE SPACE </p><p>BEING USED BY WFP IN THE NORTH IS MINIMAL, SO THERE IS NO </p><p>UNUSED SPACE AVAILABLE TO OTHER INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN </p><p>AGENCIES.  WFP, HOWEVER, COULD CONSTRUCT TEMPORARY </p><p>WAREHOUSES, I.E. RUBB HALLS, AS IT DOES IN PLACES AROUND THE </p><p>WORLD THAT COULD BE SHARED WITH OTHERS.  PERHAPS, OTHERS </p><p>COULD USE THE FOOD/FLOUR AGENTS TO DISTRIBUTE NON-FOOD ITEMS, </p><p>HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT THE AGENTS ARE SMALL </p><p>SHOP OWNERS, SO THEY DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF STORAGE SPACE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>PORT UMM QASR </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S) QUESTION 4.1.  APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY WFP PERSONNEL </p><p>WORK AT THE UMM QASR FACILITY?  WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS AND </p><p>DISTRIBTION OF PERSONNEL, INTERNATIONAL VERSUS NATIONAL, </p><p>CROSS-REFERENCED BY ROLE.  COULD OTHER PERSONNEL FILL IN FOR </p><p>THE UN IF NEEDED?  WFP REPORTS THAT NO/NO WFP PERSONNEL WORK </p><p>IN THE PORT UMM QASR.

(S) QUESTION 4.2  HOW DO THE BULK OF THE IRAQ NATIONAL </p><p>WORKING WITH WFP GET PAID?  WHAT IS TH WAGE FOR A PORT </p><p>WORKER, TRUCK DRIVER, CRANE OPEATOR, ETC.?  WFP\'S NATIONAL </p><p>STAFF GET PAID IN USDOLLARS, IN CASH, ON A MONTHLY BASIS. </p><p>WFP\'S BAGHAD OFFICE SENDS THE STAFF HOURS TO WFP\'S REGIONALOFFICE IN CAIR </p><p>O.  WFP/CAIRO SENDS THE REQUEST FOR UNDS TO </p><p>OIP.  OIP DISBURSES THE MONEY TO U.N. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM </p><p>(UNDP) IN BAGHDAD, WHO IN TURN GIVES THE DOLLARS TO THE </p><p>WFP/BAGHDAD.   SINCE WFP HAS NO NATIONAL STAFF AT THE PORT, </p><p>NO AVERAGE WAGES CAN BE PROVIDED FOR PORT STAFF. THE </p><p>FUNCTIONS MENTIONED ABOVE ARE FILLED BY THE MOT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (S)QUESTION 4.3.

(C) AS REPORTED IN REF B, WFP HAS FORMED A TASK FORCE </p><p>THAT HAS HELD TWO MEETINGS THUS FAR.  THE NEXT MEETING IS ON </p><p>JANUARY 2.  ONE OF ITS FIRST TASKS HAS BEEN TO IDENTIFY </p><p>POTENTIAL STAFF THAT COULD BE PULLED FROM OTHER OPERATIONS. </p><p>IT IS COMPILING A ROSTER AND NOTIFYING THE STAFF REGARDING </p><p>THEIR POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT IN A POTENTIAL WFP GULF </p><p>OPERATION.  THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND DIRECTOR OF </p><p>OPERATIONS, JEAN-JACQUES GRAISSE, IS ALSO BECOMING VERY </p><p>PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE CONTINGENCY PLANNING ASPECTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>VIEWS ON RE-ESTABLISHING THE CURRENT SYSTEM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) THE KEY TO RE-STARTING THE CURRENT FOOD DISTRIBUTION </p><p>SYSTEM, IF THE ENTIRE OR PARTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE DERAILED, IS </p><p>THE MOT AND THE WFP NATIONAL STAFF.  AS STATED IN REF B AND </p><p>REITERATED IN PARA 3 ABOVE, THE MOT PLAYS A TREMENDOUS ROLE </p><p>IN THE SYSTEM, FROM START TO FINISH.  IF POSSIBLE AT THIS </p><p>STAGE, U.S. MISSION RECOMMENDS THE USG CONTEMPLATE HOW BEST </p><p>TO CONTACT THESE INDIVIDUALS IF THERE IS A REGIME CHANGE, IN </p><p>ORDER TO ASK/ENCOURAGE THEM TO RESUME THEIR PRIOR DUTIES. </p><p>THESE STAFF KNOW THEIR JOBS WELL, AND AS IT IS DESCRIBED, THE </p><p>CURRENT SYSTEM IS A WELL OILED-MACHINE THAT REQUIRES MINIMUM </p><p>DAILY MAINTENANCE TO KEEP IT GOING, BUT THE MOT STAFF ARE </p><p>KEY. </p><p> </p><p>14. (S) WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WFP ADAPT THE SAME DUTIES FOR </p><p>THE SOUTH/CENTRAL REGION THAT IT CURRENTLY ASSUMES IN THE </p><p>NORTH, WITH SOME ADDITIONAL ONES.  THE MOT STAFF COULD </p><p>CONTINUE THEIR SAME DUTIES BUT WITH CLOSER OVERISIGHT AND </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06153  04 OF 05  301329Z </p><p>DIRECTION FROM WFP.  THESE DUTIES WOULD INCLUDE MAKING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL (IF SANCTIONS WERE LIFTED) TENDERS </p><p>FOR THE FOOD, CONTRACTING THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL </p><p>TRANSPORT, MANAGEMENT OF THE PIPELINE, MAINTENANCE OF THE </p><p>BENEFICIARY DATABASE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, AND OVERSEEING </p><p>THE MILLING AND STORAGE OPERATION.  (NOTE:  WE UNDERSTAND </p><p>THERE IS SOME SKIMMING TAKING PLACE ON THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PURCHASES.  WFP WOULD HAVE THE TOUGH JOB OF CLEANING THIS UP. </p><p> END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>15. (S) IN ORDER FOR WFP TO HAVE MONEY FOR THE FOOD </p><p>PURCHASES, THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL NEEDS TO GIVE WFP LEGAL </p><p>OWNERSHIP OF THE CURRENT OIP FOOD CONTRACTS.  AND AS REPORTED </p><p>IN REF B, WFP NEEDS TO AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN A </p><p>POST-CONFLICT ZONE DETERMINE THE STATUS OF EACH OF THE </p><p>FOLLOWING: 1)  HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY; 2) WHAT IS LEFT OF </p><p>THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN EACH AREA; 3)  THE INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CAPACITIES OF THE VARIOUS OFFICES OF THE MOT; 4) CURRENT </p><p>STOCKS IN COUNTRY AND WHAT IS IN THE OFF PIPELINE.  TO THE </p><p>EXTENT POSSIBLE, USG PERSONNEL SHOULD ASSIST WFP IN THESE </p><p>TASKS. </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET        PTQ4272 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  06153  05 OF 05  301331Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00  L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      NEA-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00   SAS-00   SWCI-00    /004W </p><p>                  ------------------1E165F  301331Z /07 </p><p>O 301137Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7515 </p><p>AMEMBASSY AMMAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERLIN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KUWAIT </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>COMJSOC FT BRAGG NC//J2// </p><p>COMJSOC FT BRAGG NC </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3039 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06153  05 OF 05  301331Z </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T SECTION 05 OF 05 ROME 006153 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>JOINT STAFF FOR JE/J4/J5 </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, EUR/WE, EUR/NE, SA/INS, IO/EDA </p><p>USAID FOR A/AID, AA/DCHA, DCHA/OFDA, DCHA/FFP, AA/ANE, </p><p>PPC/DP, PPC/DC </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEU </p><p>USUN FOR MLUTZ </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAGR, EAID, KUNR, PHUM, PREF, WFP </p><p>SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING WFP AND FOOD </p><p>DISTRIBUTION IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>16.
