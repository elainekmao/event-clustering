<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL -- MAXSTADT </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, MOPS, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NAVY MINISTER: NOTHING WILL HAPPEN ON </p><p>BENUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 205 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 228 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During a January 23 conversation with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, Minister of State for Defense (Navy) Chris Agbobu </p><p>commented on the October 2001 Benue massacre.  Agbobu did </p><p>not expect anyone to be held accountable. Agbobu said </p><p>while "everyone knows what happened (at Benue)" nothing </p><p>would come of the government\'s investigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Agbobu remarked that defeated PDP presidential </p><p>aspirant and Benue native Barnabas Gemade\'s unsuccessful </p><p>attempt to use the Benue incident to weaken Obasanjo during </p><p>the PDP convention proved that the people of Benue did not </p><p>blame the government for the killings.  According to </p><p>Agbobu, most people realized that the massacre would not </p><p>have happened if "criminals" had not killed and mutilated </p><p>19 soldiers. Implying that he thought the attack on Zaki </p><p>Biam had been  authorized by someone within the senior </p><p>levels of the military or government,  Agbobu said the </p><p>military acted correctly and that the Army would have </p><p>reacted even more forcefully if the decision had been his. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: Agbobu became the naval Minister of State </p><p>only last month and was at the Ministry of Agriculture when </p><p>the massacre happened.  In that position, he was well known </p><p>to the Ambassador, and following his appointment to the MOD </p><p>called on the Ambassador at the Embassy on January 23. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Agbobu\'s implication that the attack on Zaki Biam </p><p>was authorized at a level significantly higher than that of </p><p>those in immediate command of the offending soldiers is </p><p>troubling; however, Agbobu is neither a military insider, </p><p>nor was he at the MOD at the time of the Benue incident. </p><p>He appears to be giving us his opinion more than anything </p><p>else.  His belief that the GON will never hold anyone </p><p>accountable for Benue may also be his personal view but it </p><p>is one shared by many Nigerians.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
