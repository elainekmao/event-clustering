IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A MAY 22 MEETING WITH VISITING INR POLITICAL- </p><p>MILITARY AFFAIRS SPECIALIST STEVE WEIGERT, SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND ZANU-PF SECRETARY OF ADMINISTRATION </p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA EXPOUNDED ON RECENT EVENTS IN THE </p><p>DRC, AND TOUCHED ON LAND REFORM ISSUES, WAR VETERANS, </p><p>AND PROSPECTS FOR THE MDC.  POLOFF ACCOMPANIED WEIGERT, </p><p>AND MNANGAGWA WAS JOINED BY HIS DEPUTY SECRETARY OF </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, WITNESS MANGWENDE, AND ADMINISTRATION </p><p>DIRECTOR FRED SHAVA IN HIS ZANU-PF HEADQUARTERS OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MNANGAGWA, WHO OVERSEES ZANU-PF\'S SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>BUSINESS INTERESTS IN THE DRC, SAID ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM THAT COUNTRY WAS CONTINUING. </p><p>HE WAS SATISFIED WITH MONUC\'S DEPLOYMENT OF OBSERVERS </p><p>AND PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A COMPLETE RETURN TO </p><p>PEACE BY NEXT YEAR.  THE SPEAKER NOTED AMUSEDLY THAT IN </p><p>RWANDAN PRESIDENT KAGAME\'S MAY 7 VISIT TO HARARE </p><p>(REFTEL), THE LATTER APPEARED TO BE TRYING TO BUILD A </p><p>BRIDGE TO ZIMBABWE, SUGGESTING A RWANDAN INTEREST IN </p><p>JOINING SADC.  MNANGAGWA CLAIMED KAGAME WAS MAKING </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANS IN THE EVENT THAT UGANDA/RWANDA </p><p>RELATIONS DETERIORATED FURTHER AND UGANDA INVADED </p><p>RWANDA.  SADC MEMBERSHIP WOULD PRESUMABLY PERMIT KIGALI </p><p>TO CALL FOR REGIONAL MILITARY SUPPORT.  ON THE ISSUE OF </p><p>POSSIBLE ZIMBABWE/ANGOLA DIFFERENCES IN THE DRC, </p><p>MNANGAGWA STATED THAT ANGOLA\'S INTERESTS IN THE DRC WERE </p><p>SPECIAL AND COMPLICATED AND CLAIMED THAT UNITA BASES IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01730  300946Z </p><p>THE DRC WERE A REMAINING CONCERN, EVEN THOUGH THE UNITA </p><p>ISSUE WAS NOT A PART OF THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>ALSO MADE A PASSING REFERENCE TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF PEACE </p><p>TALKS AND EVENTUAL ELECTIONS IN ANGOLA, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>SUGGESTED THIS WAS NOT A NEAR-TERM DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON THE LAND REFORM ISSUE, MNANGAGWA DELVED INTO </p><p>THE TIRED HISTRIONICS OF LAND OWNERSHIP IN ZIMBABWE, </p><p>ESPOUSING THE GOVERNMENT POSITION VERBATIM.  ON THE </p><p>QUESTION OF WAR VETERANS, THE SPEAKER EXPLAINED WITH </p><p>SOME TESTINESS THAT MANY EMPLOYEES HAD ASKED THEM TO </p><p>RESOLVE LONG-OUTSTANDING DISPUTES THAT THE ZCTU HAD </p><p>NEGLECTED, BUT A FEW ROGUE ELEMENTS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>THE SITUATION BY INTIMIDATING AND KIDNAPPING PEOPLE, AND </p><p>THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO BOOK.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE </p><p>MDC\'S PROSPECTS, MNANGAGWA ACKNOWLEDGED, WITHOUT RANCOR, </p><p>THAT THE MDC WOULD CONTINUE TO DO WELL IN URBAN </p><p>ELECTIONS, AND INTIMATED THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO BE A </p><p>FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: MNANGAGWA WAS CORDIAL AND, FOR THE MOST </p><p>PART, REASONED IN HIS RESPONSES.  HE APPEARS TO BE ON A </p><p>CHARM OFFENSIVE WITH THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS IN AN ATTEMPT </p><p>TO SOFTEN HIS GOVERNMENT\'S, AND HIS OWN, IMAGE.  HE </p><p>CONVENED THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS LAST WEEK TO CALL </p><p>ATTENTION TO PARLIAMENTARY REFORMS.  IN A MEETING </p><p>BETWEEN SHAVA AND POLOFF ON MAY 18, SHAVA OFFERED TO </p><p>ARRANGE THE MEETING WITH MNANGAGWA, AND THE SPEAKER </p><p>AGREED.  THIS CORE ZANU-PF CADRE APPEARED GENUINELY </p><p>PLEASED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO AMERICANS, AND </p><p>REFRAINED FROM THE INVECTIVE THAT HAS CHARACTERIZED OUR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01730  300946Z </p><p>RECENT MEETINGS WITH GOZ OFFICIALS.
