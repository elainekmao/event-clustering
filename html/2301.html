(C) DURING HIS DECEMBER 10-11 VISIT TO HARARE, AF </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY MET WITH A RANGE OF INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING MDC LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, SUPREME </p><p>COURT JUSTICE WILSON SANDURA, UNDP RESREP VICTOR ANGELO, </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) OFFICIALS, AND </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS AND OTHER NGOS. </p><p>KANSTEINER HEARD A CONSISTENT REFRAIN THAT ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>POLITICAL CRISIS AND ECONOMIC MESS WILL CONTINUE TO WORSEN </p><p>IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION AND THAT THE GOZ/ZANU-PF ARE </p><p>EMPLOYING A RANGE OF TACTICS TO INCREASE THEIR PROSPECTS IN </p><p>NEXT YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND LIMIT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SCRUTINY OF THEIR ACTIONS.  ON ZDERA, TSVANGIRAI RECOGNIZED </p><p>THE THREAT OF IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE RULING ELITE </p><p>COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE ACTION, BUT HE HOPED THE </p><p>USG WOULD IMPLEMENT AT LEAST ONE RESTRICTION TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>THAT IT MEANS BUSINESS.  A PROMINENT HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST </p><p>ASSERTED THAT, SINCE THE JUDICIARY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED, </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS NOW MUST COUNT ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03730  01 OF 05  141045Z </p><p>TO HOLD THE ZANU-PF LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS ACTIONS. </p><p>UNDP RESREP REPORTED THAT WFP IS READY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, BUT THE GOZ HAS NOT SIGNED THE </p><p>LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE IT DISAGREES WITH WFP\'S </p><p>ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF THE FOOD CRISIS, AND BECAUSE THE </p><p>TWO SIDES HAVE NOT AGREED ON THE DELIVERY MECHANISM. (NOTE: </p><p>THE LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING WAS SIGNED SUBSEQUENT TO THIS </p><p>MEETING.)  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL GIFT CHIMANIKIRE AND ELECTIONS </p><p>DIRECTOR PAUL THEMBA-NYATHI, TOLD KANSTEINER THAT HIS PARTY </p><p>IS UNABLE TO CAMPAIGN IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY MASHONALAND CENTRAL AND PARTS OF MASHONALAND </p><p>WEST.  ASKED HOW THE MDC GOT ITS MESSAGE TO THE RESIDENTS </p><p>OF THOSE AREAS, TSVANGIRAI SAID SUPPORTERS GO IN UNDER THE </p><p>COVER OF NIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE PAMPHLETS, NOT, HE POINTED </p><p>OUT, AN APPROACH ONE WOULD EXPECT IN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. </p><p>HE ADDED THAT THE BREAK BETWEEN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS </p><p>IN JUNE 2000 AND NEXT YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAS </p><p>ENABLED THE PARTY TO PENETRATE AREAS FORMERLY CLOSED TO IT, </p><p>AND GIVEN THEM TIME TO CONVINCE ZIMBABWEANS THAT THE ONLY </p><p>WAY TO STOP THE VIOLENCE IS TO VOTE OUT THE CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  TSVANGIRAI PREDICTED THAT THE MDC WOULD HAVE </p><p>LOST IF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAD BEEN HELD IN JUNE </p><p>2000.  THE PARTY\'S VICTORY IN THE CHEGUTU MAYORAL RACE IS A </p><p>GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE BENEFITS OF THAT BREAK IN THE ACTION, </p><p>AND PROVIDED A HUGE PSYCHOLOGICAL BOOST TO THE PARTY AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03730  01 OF 05  141045Z </p><p>ITS SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) TSVANGIRAI SAID THE CHALLENGE FOR THE MDC IS TO </p><p>STAY FOCUSED ON WINNING THE ELECTION AND NOT ALLOW ITSELF </p><p>TO BE DISTRACTED BY INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE </p><p>SADC EFFORT WHICH, FROM THE GOZ PERSPECTIVE, ARE ONLY MEANT </p><p>TO BUY TIME.  HE REPORTED THAT ZANU-PF ELDER STATESMAN </p><p>EDDISON ZVOBGO\'S ESTRANGEMENT FROM MUGABE IS PROVING </p><p>HELPFUL TO THE MDC\'S PROSPECTS IN PIVOTAL MASVINGO </p><p>PROVINCE.  ASKED WHETHER ZVOBGO, WHO IS THE KINGMAKER IN </p><p>MASVINGO, IS TELLING HIS SUPPORTERS TO VOTE FOR THE MDC, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SAID HE IS TELLING THEM TO GO AND VOTE, BUT NOT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>FOR MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE MDC LEADER RAISED ZDERA, SAYING HE THOUGHT ITS </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE CAUGHT THE GOZ BY SURPRISE, AND KEY </p><p>LEADERS ARE IN A PANIC AT THE POSSIBILITY THEY MIGHT BE </p><p>TARGETED.  HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE THREAT MAY BE MORE </p><p>EFFECTIVE THAN THE IMPOSITION, BUT HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE </p><p>NECESSARY FOR THE USG TO IMPLEMENT AT LEAST ONE RESTRICTION </p><p>IN ADVANCE OF THE ELECTION TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT MEANS </p><p>BUSINESS.  KANSTEINER RESPONDED THAT WE DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY </p><p>IN SELECTING WHOM WOULD BE TARGETED AND IN OUR CHOICE OF </p><p>EITHER TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS OR ASSET SEIZURE, OR BOTH.

TSVANGIRAI SUGGESTED  KANSTEINER </p><p>COULD LESSEN THAT RISK BY EMPHASIZING IN HIS PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE LATER THAT DAY THAT ZDERA DOES NOT IMPOSE </p><p>SANCTIONS AGAINST THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE, WHICH THE USG </p><p>CONTINUES TO HELP WITH SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THEMBA-NYATHI URGED THE UNITED STATES TO COORDINATE </p><p>CLOSELY WITH ZIMBABWE\'S SADC NEIGHBORS.  WE ARE DOING THAT </p><p>ON SEVERAL LEVELS, KANSTEINER REPLIED.  HE SAID HE HAD MET </p><p>AT UNGA WITH SADC FOREIGN MINISTERS, AND THAT ALL OF THEM, </p><p>WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF ANGOLA AND NAMIBIA, AGREED </p><p>WITH THE U.S. APPROACH TOWARD ZIMBABWE.  PRESIDENTS BUSH </p><p>AND MBEKI HAD ALSO HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT ZIMBABWE </p><p>AND, ON THE MARGINS, HE HAD PRESSED FM ZUMA ON THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF SOUTH AFRICA TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN </p><p>ADDRESSING THE CRISIS CONSUMING ITS NORTHERN NEIGHBOR. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) TURNING TO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, THEMBA-NYATHI </p><p>RECALLED  MINISTER OF JUSTICE CHINAMASA\'S STATEMENT IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT THAT THE GOZ DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO </p><p>PURCHASE TRANSLUCENT BALLOT BOXES BUT WOULD ACCEPT </p><p>DONATIONS FROM THE UNDP FOR THIS PURPOSE, AND HE URGED THAT </p><p>WE CALL CHINAMASA\'S BLUFF.  THE AMBASSADOR AGREED TO MAKE </p><p>SUCH AN OFFER TO THE UNDP (WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY OFFERED UNDP </p><p>FUNDING TO CHINAMASA).  POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF RECALLED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03730  02 OF 05  141045Z </p><p>THAT ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION (ESC) CHAIRMAN GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE HAD DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS IN A RECENT MEETING </p><p>WITH US TO ACCEPT THE INPUT OF POLITICAL PARTIES.  IF THE </p><p>ESC WAS SERIOUS ABOUT SUCH AN OFFER, TSVANGIRAI REJOINED, </p><p>IT WOULD INVITE PARTY REPRESENTATIVES TO SIT ON THE </p><p>COMMISSION.  TWO ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS, THEMBA-NYATHI </p><p>COMMENTED, ARE THE ESC\'S ABDICATION OF MUCH OF ITS </p><p>AUTHORITY TO THE PARTISAN REGISTRAR-GENERAL, AND THE </p><p>ELECTORAL ACT\'S VESTING OF TOO MUCH POWER IN THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>WHO IS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE VIEW FROM CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN A LUNCH WITH HUMAN RIGHTS AND OTHER CIVIC </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, KANSTEINER NOTED THE CRUCIAL ROLE THEY PLAY </p><p>IN A DEMOCRACY, PRAISED THEM FOR THEIR COURAGE UNDER </p><p>DIFFICULT CONDITIONS, AND EXPRESSED U.S. SUPPORT FOR THEIR </p><p>EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) REGINALD MATCHABE-HOVE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>ELECTION SUPPORT NETWORK (ZESN), EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE ELECTORAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF </p><p>PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE ELECTORAL ACT.  PROVISIONS OF </p><p>PARTICULAR CONCERN WERE REQUIREMENTS THAT: ONLY CIVIL </p><p>SERVANTS WOULD SERVE AS MONITORS; ALL FUNDING FOR VOTER </p><p>EDUCATION MUST GO THROUGH THE GOZ-APPOINTED ESC; THE </p><p>REGISTRAR-GENERAL AND HIS OFFICERS WILL BE EMPOWERED TO </p><p>ALTER THE VOTERS ROLL AT ANY TIME; AND ONLY DIPLOMATS AND </p><p>SOLDIERS WOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE BY ABSENTEE BALLOT, </p><p>POTENTIALLY DISENFRANCHISING UP TO ONE MILLION ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03730  02 OF 05  141045Z </p><p>LIVING ABROAD.  EILEEN SAWYER, EXECUTIVE-DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>LEGAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION, SAID THE CITIZENSHIP ACT, WHICH </p><p>REQUIRES ZIMBABWEAN DUAL CITIZENS TO RENOUNCE THEIR FOREIGN </p><p>CITIZENSHIP, COULD DISENFRANCHISE UP TO TWO MILLION PEOPLE, </p><p>PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL FARMWORKERS OF MOZAMBICAN, MALAWIAN, </p><p>AND BOTSWANAN ORIGIN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) TONY REELER, DIRECTOR OF THE WELL-RESPECTED HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ORGANIZATION, AMANI TRUST, SAID IT IS CLEAR FROM THE </p><p>PENDING LEGISLATION THAT GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO CLOSE DOWN </p><p>PUBLIC SPACE.  IN ADDITION TO THE BILLS DESCRIBED ABOVE, </p><p>REELER DECRIED THE PENDING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND </p><p>PROTECTION OF PRIVACY ACT, WHICH COULD DO AWAY WITH </p><p>INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS, AND THE "DRACONIAN" PUBLIC ORDER </p><p>AND SECURITY BILL, WHICH WILL GREATLY INCREASE THE POWERS </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT TO SQUELCH DISSENT.  ACCORDING TO REELER, </p><p>VIOLENCE IS SPREADING, NOT DIMINISHING, THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  THE ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS PERPETRATING THE </p><p>PREPONDERANCE OF THE VIOLENCE HAVE SET UP BASE CAMPS </p><p>NATIONWIDE, AND MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN DRAWN FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RECENTLY-INAUGURATED NATIONAL YOUTH SERVICE </p><p>TRAINING PROGRAM.  IN ADDITION, THE GOZ HAS ACCELERATED ITS </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MDC AT EVERY LEVEL.  LYDIA ZIGOMO, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE ZIMBABWE WOMEN LAWYERS\' ASSOCIATION, SAID </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3697 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03730  03 OF 05  141046Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------4B7533  141046Z /38 </p><p>P 140948Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0547 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 05 HARARE 003730 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03730  03 OF 05  141046Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 12/04/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  A/S KANSTEINER DELIVERS MESSAGE OF SUPPORT TO </p><p>OPPOSITION AND CIVIL SOCIETY REPRESENTATIVES </p><p> </p><p>IT IS HARD TO GET A GOOD SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THE </p><p>VIOLENCE, AND TO MEASURE ITS FULL IMPACT, BECAUSE SO MANY </p><p>RURAL AREAS HAVE BEEN DECLARED OFF-LIMITS TO ANYONE OTHER </p><p>THAN ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) KANSTEINER ASKED AT WHAT POINT CIVIL SOCIETY WOULD </p><p>DECIDE THAT THE ELECTION CANNOT POSSIBLY BE FREE AND FAIR. </p><p>ANDREW NGONGO, DIRECTOR OF TRANSPARENCY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL/ZIMBABWE, SAID THE FOCUS OF MOST CIVIC </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS HAS BEEN ON PRESSING THE GOZ TO ABIDE BY </p><p>MINIMUM ELECTORAL STANDARDS, SUCH AS AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>ELECTION COMMISSION AND BALANCED ACCESS TO THE MEDIA, BUT </p><p>HE AGREED THAT CIVIC GROUPS NEED TO CONSIDER THE POINT </p><p>KANSTEINER RAISED.  NGO REPRESENTATIVES RECOGNIZED THAT THE </p><p>MDC WAS COMMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS, COME </p><p>WHAT MAY, AND THAT CIVIL SOCIETY COULD NOT UNDERCUT THEIR </p><p>DECISION TO CONTEST. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) BRIAN KAGORO, A LEADING LAWYER AND COORDINATOR OF </p><p>THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE TASK FORCE, DECLARED THAT THE GOZ IS </p><p>PURSUING A "TOTAL STRATEGY" THAT WILL KEEP THEM IN POWER </p><p>WELL BEYOND THE ELECTION.  THE RESTRICTIVE LAWS WILL REMAIN </p><p>IN PLACE, YOUTHS IN THE NATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAM ARE </p><p>RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING, WAR VETERANS ARE BEING ISSUED </p><p>GUNS; THESE ARE THE ACTIONS OF A GOVERNMENT PLANNING FOR </p><p>THE LONGER TERM, NOT JUST FOR AN ELECTION WHICH IS ONLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03730  03 OF 05  141046Z </p><p>MONTHS AWAY.  GOVERNMENT, HE ASSERTED, IS "TRYING TO TAKE </p><p>US BACK TO 1965 AND RESUSCITATE RHODESIA," BY CLOSING DOWN </p><p>THE ECONOMY AND POLITICAL AND CIVIC SPACE.  REELER LAMENTED </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWEANS CAN NO LONGER DEPEND ON THE COURTS TO ACT </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY AND MUST NOW DEPEND ON THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO HOLD ZANU-PF LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR </p><p>ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>JUSTICE SANDURA </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SANDURA IS ZIMBABWE\'S SENIOR </p><p>BLACK JUDGE AND HAS SERVED ON THE SUPREME COURT SINCE 1998. </p><p>HE WAS WIDELY CONSIDERED THE LEADING CANDIDATE TO REPLACE </p><p>FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE GUBBAY BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT\'S MOVE TO </p><p>STACK THE COUNTRY\'S HIGHEST BENCH WITH SYMPATHETIC JURISTS. </p><p>SANDURA WAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF HIS NEW COLLEAGUES\' DECEMBER 3 </p><p>RULING ENDORSING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE FAST TRACK </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND AGREEING THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAD </p><p>BEEN RESTORED ON COMMERCIAL FARMS (REF C).  THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW, HE SAID, PREVAILS NOWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT ON </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS AND NOT IN URBAN AREAS.  CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU\'S  JUDGMENT IN THE CASE WAS MERELY A POLITICAL </p><p>STATEMENT WHICH IGNORED THE LEGAL ISSUES.  IN ORDER TO </p><p>CLAIM THAT IT WAS ABIDING BY THE RULE OF LAW, THE GOZ HAD </p><p>LEGALIZED THE OCCUPATION OF FARMS.  "HOW CAN YOU PASS A LAW </p><p>SAYING THAT A TRESPASSER WHO COMES INTO YOUR HOUSE CAN STAY </p><p>THERE UNTIL YOU FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PUT HIM?"  THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS WHAT IS DRIVING FAST TRACK, </p><p>SANDURA SAID, AS GIVING LAND TO THE PEOPLE IS THE ONLY </p><p>ISSUE MUGABE HAS TO TALK ABOUT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03730  03 OF 05  141046Z </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) SANDURA DESCRIBED THE CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION </p><p>AGAINST THE JUDICIARY DURING THE PAST YEAR, INCLUDING THE </p><p>INVASION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN DECEMBER 2000 AND THE </p><p>THREATS BY WAR VETERANS TO KILL JUDGES IN THEIR HOMES. </p><p>POINTING OUT THAT NOT A SINGLE GOVERNMENT MINISTER </p><p>CRITICIZED THESE DEVELOPMENTS, SANDURA ASKED WHAT MESSAGE </p><p>THAT SENT TO THE WAR VETERANS.  ASKED WHETHER HE OR OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO </p><p>ADDITIONAL INTIMIDATION SINCE GUBBAY\'S FORCED RESIGNATION </p><p>IN JULY, SANDURA SAID NO, BECAUSE THE GOZ HAD ACHIEVED ITS </p><p>OBJECTIVE OF APPOINTING FOUR NEW JUSTICES WHO WILL DO WHAT </p><p>THEY ARE TOLD. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF NOTED THAT GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>LIKELY UNHAPPY WITH SANDURA\'S RECENT DECISION THAT THE </p><p>HARARE MAYORAL ELECTION MUST BE HELD BY FEBRUARY 11.  THE </p><p>JUSTICE REPLIED THAT THE LAW WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND </p><p>PROVIDED LITTLE LATITUDE FOR RULING ANY OTHER WAY.

HE ADDED THAT AN MDC PRESIDENT AND HIS CABINET WOULD </p><p>HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY GETTING ANY LAWS PASSED THROUGH </p><p>PARLIAMENT, GIVEN ZANU-PF\'S MAJORITY IN THE LEGISLATIVE </p><p>BODY.  A PRESIDENT TSVANGIRAI WOULD HAVE LITTLE CHOICE, </p><p>THEREFORE, BUT TO CALL FOR A NEW PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, </p><p>WHICH IS A CLEAR PRESIDENTIAL PREROGATIVE UNDER THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) CFU ACTING PRESIDENT DOUG TAYLOR AND DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR MALCOLM VOWLES PROVIDED A BLEAK ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>EXPECTED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.  MAIZE PRODUCTION WOULD </p><p>LIKELY BE 25% OF NORMAL LEVELS, WHILE SOYBEAN AND WHEAT </p><p>PLANTINGS ARE EACH DOWN 60%.

(C) UNDP RESREP VICTOR ANGELO TOLD KANSTEINER THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ROAD IN TERMS OF </p><p>POLITICAL CRISIS AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.  ACCESS TO FOOD IS </p><p>ALREADY BECOMING DIFFICULT IN RURAL AREAS.  FARMERS ARE </p><p>EITHER HOLDING ONTO THEIR GRAIN OR FEEDING IT TO THEIR </p><p>ANIMALS BECAUSE OF THE LOW PRICES BEING OFFERED BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  ASKED WHETHER THE GOZ HAS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES </p><p>TO IMPORT GRAIN OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS, ANGELO SAID THE </p><p>FOREX SHORTAGE POSES A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE.  THEY HAVE </p><p>RECENTLY IMPORTED 100,000 TONS OF MAIZE FROM SOUTH AFRICA, </p><p>WHICH WILL ONLY MAKE THE LOOMING MAIZE SHORTAGE "LESS </p><p>DRAMATIC."  WFP IS READY TO MOVE, BUT THE GOZ HAS NOT </p><p>SIGNED THE LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING (LOU) BECAUSE IT </p><p>DISAGREES WITH WFP\'S ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF THE FOOD </p><p>CRISIS AND BECAUSE THE TWO SIDES HAVE YET TO AGREE ON A </p><p>DELIVERY MECHANISM.  WFP\'S POSITION ON THE LATTER POINT IS </p><p>CLEAR, ACCORDING TO ANGELO: THAT WFP MUST MAINTAIN CONTROL </p><p>OVER FOOD DELIVERIES, WHICH CANNOT BE USED BY EITHER MAJOR </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY TO LOBBY FOR VOTES.  IF THE LOU WERE SIGNED </p><p>TODAY, ANGELO SAID WFP COULD HAVE AN OPERATION IN PLACE </p><p>WITHIN TWO WEEKS, AND WOULD BEGIN BY DRAWING DOWN SOME </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3702 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03730  05 OF 05  141046Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------4B755C  141046Z /38 </p><p>P 140948Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0549 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 05 OF 05 HARARE 003730 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03730  05 OF 05  141046Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 12/04/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  A/S KANSTEINER DELIVERS MESSAGE OF SUPPORT TO </p><p>OPPOSITION AND CIVIL SOCIETY REPRESENTATIVES </p><p> </p><p>STOCKS IN MOZAMBIQUE.  (NOTE:  THE LOU HAS BEEN SIGNED </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY, WITH THE GOZ AGREEING TO WFP TERMS.) </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) TURNING TO INTERNAL POLITICS, ANGELO SAID A </p><p>GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITHIN ZANU-PF REALIZE THE RULING </p><p>PARTY IS ON A SUICIDAL PATH, BUT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO </p><p>STAND UP TO PRESIDENT MUGABE.  POLICY IS DETERMINED BY A </p><p>SMALL GROUP OF HARDLINERS AROUND MUGABE, WHO ARE ENERGETIC </p><p>AND VOCAL.  ANGELO INCLUDED IN THIS GROUP INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO; JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA; </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT MINISTER IGNATIUS CHOMBO ("VERY TOUGH AND </p><p>AMBITIOUS, A STRATEGIC THINKER, COMES FROM THE SAME REGION </p><p>AS MUGABE"); POLICE COMMISSIONER AUGUSTINE CHIHURI; AIR </p><p>FORCE COMMANDER PERENCE SHIRI; AND CHARLES UTETE ("A KEY </p><p>PLAYER; BECAUSE OF HIS TRAINING IN THE U.S., HE UNDERSTANDS </p><p>THE NEED TO COMPROMISE AND WOULD BE READY TO DO BUSINESS.") </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THE MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP WOULD CUT MUGABE </p><p>LOOSE, ANGELO SAID YES, BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE LAWS OF HUMAN </p><p>NATURE, THAT MUGABE WILL GO SOONER OR LATER.  THE MEMBERS </p><p>OF THIS GROUP ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THREE ISSUES: </p><p>THE ELECTION, SUCCESSION, AND PROTECTION (OF ASSETS AND </p><p>FROM PROSECUTION).  UNLESS THESE THREE ISSUES ARE </p><p>ADDRESSED, ANGELO EMPHASIZED, WE WILL NOT SEE ANY CHANGE IN </p><p>THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>21.

THE UN HAD TOLD THE </p><p>GOZ IT WANTED AN INVITATION BY SEPTEMBER BECAUSE IT DID NOT </p><p>WANT A TEAM TO COME IN AT THE LAST MINUTE MERELY TO ENDORSE </p><p>A FLAWED PROCESS.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID SOME ANALYSTS </p><p>CONTEND THAT THE GOZ IS EMPLOYING A COMPREHENSIVE, WELL- </p><p>COORDINATED STRATEGY TO ENSURE IT WINS THE ELECTION.  IS </p><p>THE STRATEGY REALLY THAT WELL-ORCHESTRATED, OR IS IT MOSTLY </p><p>CONFUSION AND DISORDER?  A COMBINATION OF THE TWO, ANGELO </p><p>REPLIED.  THE GOZ IS DOING THINGS LIKE MAKING IT VERY </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR YOUNG, URBAN VOTERS TO REGISTER BUT WILL </p><p>FIND, IN THE END, THAT IT IS NOT EASY TO MANAGE THE VOTE- </p><p>COUNTING PROCESS TO ITS SATISFACTION.  THE GOZ, HE SAID, </p><p>COULD EXPERIENCE "A VERY COLD SHOWER" ONCE THE VOTES ARE </p><p>COUNTED.  THE ANTI-ZANU-PF PROTEST VOTE IS GROWING DAILY </p><p>ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE REALIZE THEIR </p><p>COUNTRY IS BEING RUINED AND DO NOT WANT ZIMBABWE TO BECOME </p><p>THE LATEST FAILED AFRICAN STATE. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C) COMMENT: IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>FOLLOWING A/S KANSTEINER\'S DEPARTURE, ANGELO AGREED TO CALL </p><p>CHINAMASA\'S BLUFF ON TRANSLUCENT BALLOT BOXES.  HE REPORTED </p><p>BACK THAT CHINAMASA ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND HAD PROMISED TO </p><p>SEND AN OFFICIAL REQUEST.  WHEN AND IF THIS ARRIVES, WE </p><p>HAVE PRE-PROGRAMMED ESF WITH WHICH TO PROVIDE PARTIAL </p><p>FUNDING FOR THIS COMMODITY THROUGH UNDP.
