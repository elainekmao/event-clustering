(U) SUMMARY: TWO HIGH-RANKING GVN OFFICIALS, ONE THE </p><p>     NUMBER TWO PROSECUTOR AND ANOTHER A CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>     MEMBER, HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>     SOME PARTY POSITIONS FOR SUSPECTED COMPLICITY WITH AN </p><p>     ALLEGED MAJOR CRIMINAL FIGURE.    THESE MOVES ARE </p><p>     EXPECTED TO FACILITATE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE </p><p>     CASE, WHICH SO FAR HAS INVOLVED MORE THAN 100 ALLEGED </p><p>     ACCOMPLICES, REPORTEDLY INCLUDING POLICEMEN AND </p><p>     JOURNALISTS.  THIS WELL-PUBLICIZED EFFORT NONETHELESS </p><p>     WILL LIKELY BE INSUFFICIENT IN CONVINCING THE PUBLIC </p><p>     THAT CPV AND GVN ACTIONS AGAINST WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION </p><p>     AND GROWING CRIME ARE EFFECTIVE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>     2. (U) ON MAY 31, STATE PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG </p><p>     ORDERED THE SUSPENSION OF PHAM SY CHIEN, DEPUTY HEAD OF </p><p>     THE SUPREME PEOPLE\'S PROCURACY.  ON THE SAME DAY, PRIME </p><p>     MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI AUTHORIZED THE SUSPENSION OF </p><p>     TRAN MAI HANH FROM HIS POSITION AS GENERAL DIRECTOR OF </p><p>     VIETNAM STATE RADIO. (NOTE:  THE SUPREME PEOPLE\'S </p><p>     PROCURACY REPORTS TO THE STATE PRESIDENT RATHER THAN </p><p>     THE PRIME MINISTER.  END NOTE.)  THE TWO DECISIONS CAME </p><p>     AFTER THE CPV POLITBURO AND SECRETARIAT HAD ENDORSED </p><p>     RECOMMENDATIONS TO SUSPEND CHIEN AND HANH FROM THEIR </p><p>     SEATS ON THE POLITBURO-APPOINTED SUPREME PEOPLE\'S </p><p>     PROCURACY PARTY COMMITTEE AND THE POLITBURO-APPOINTED </p><p>     VOICE OF VIETNAM PARTY COMMITTEE, RESPECTIVELY. </p><p>     EARLIER, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY STANDING COMMITTEE AND </p><p>     NATIONAL ELECTION COUNCIL HAD ORDERED THAT HANH\'S NAME </p><p>     BE DROPPED FROM THE LIST OF FINAL CANDIDATES ONLY THREE </p><p>     DAYS BEFORE THE MAY 19 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION </p><p>     (REFTEL).  HANH HAS FOR NOW NOT LOST HIS SEAT ON THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01485  01 OF 02  070942Z </p><p>     CPV CENTRAL COMMITTEE, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>     3.  (SBU)  THESE CASES STEM FROM ALLEGED CONNECTIONS </p><p>     WITH AND ASSISTANCE TO TRUONG VAN CAM, AKA "NAM CAM," </p><p>     ROUTINELY DESCRIBED AS A MAJOR HO CHI MINH CITY (HCMC) </p><p>     CRIME SYNDICATE BOSS.  IN MAY 1995, NAM CAM HAD </p><p>     RECEIVED A THREE-YEAR ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION TERM, </p><p>     BUT WAS RELEASED IN OCTOBER 1997.  CHIEN AND HANH </p><p>     REPORTEDLY ISSUED A NUMBER OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AT </p><p>     THAT TIME ASKING NAM CAM\'S EARLY RELEASE, ALLEGEDLY </p><p>     ONLY AFTER NAM CAM\'S WIFE SPENT "BILLIONS" OF </p><p>     VIETNAMESE DONG TO SECURE HIS FREEDOM.  ONE SENIOR </p><p>     SUPREME PEOPLE\'S PROCURACY OFFICIAL COMMENTED PRIVATELY </p><p>     TO EMBOFF THAT NAM CAM\'S RELEASE WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>     "IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT INTERVENTION OF PHAM SY CHIEN, AND </p><p>     THOSE FROM OTHER CENTRAL OFFICES LIKE HANH." </p><p> </p><p>     4.  (U)  ACCORDING TO LOCAL OBSERVERS, THIS IS THE </p><p>     FIRST TIME IN VIETNAM THAT HIGH-RANKING GVN OFFICIALS </p><p>     HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT -- HOWEVER </p><p>     INDIRECT -- IN VIOLENT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>     GVN HAS IN THE PAST TAKEN ACTION AGAINST OFFICIALS </p><p>     INVOLVED IN FRAUD AND CORRUPTION.  "AN NINH THE GIOI," </p><p>     THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY\'S NEWSPAPER, TOUTED THE </p><p>     SUSPENSIONS OF CHIEN AND HANH AS EXAMPLES OF THE CPV </p><p>     AND GVN ACTING TO STEM THE "MORAL DEGRADATION OF STATE </p><p>     OFFICIALS."  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN MEDIA EXPOSES OF </p><p>     CHIEN\'S ALLEGED "HUGE" ASSETS; SOURCES IN THE CPV </p><p>     INVESTIGATION COMMISSION HAVE LEAKED TO THE PRESS THAT </p><p>     CHIEN HAD NOT DECLARED MANY OF THESE ASSETS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01485  01 OF 02  070942Z </p><p>     5.  (U)  POLICE RE-ARRESTED NAM CAM IN DECEMBER 2001 </p><p>     BASED ON A TIP-OFF THAT HE HAD ORDERED THE MURDER OF </p><p>     RIVAL ORGANIZED CRIME BOSS "DUNG HA."  SO FAR, MORE </p><p>     THAN 100 ALLEGED ACCOMPLICES HAVE ALSO BEEN ARRESTED; A </p><p>     SENIOR MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY (MPS) OFFICIAL IN </p><p>     LATE MAY TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE INVESTIGATION WOULD </p><p>     LIKELY LAST UNTIL AT LEAST OCTOBER, WITH MORE ARRESTS </p><p>     EXPECTED TO FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>     6.  (SBU)  COMMENT: THESE SUSPENSIONS AND WELL- </p><p>     PUBLICIZED CAMPAIGNS AGAINST CHIEN, HANH, AS WELL AS </p><p>     NAM CAM HIMSELF ARE LIKELY DESIGNED TO CONVINCE THE </p><p>     PUBLIC THAT THE CPV AND GVN ARE RESOLUTE IN MOVING </p><p>     AGAINST BOTH ORGANIZED CRIME AND OFFICIAL CORRUPTION. </p><p>     THE MEDIA ATTENTION IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE RESULT OF AN </p><p>     EXPLICIT CPV DECISION, NOT THE RESULT OF INDEPENDENT </p><p>     INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM, WHICH IS VIRTUALLY NON- </p><p>     EXISTENT IN VIETNAM.  THE CPV IS TRYING TO CONVINCE THE </p><p>     PUBLIC BY THESE ACTS THAT, AS A RECENTLY REPORTED CPV </p><p>     GUIDELINE STATED, THERE IS "NO FORBIDDEN AREA" IN </p><p>     INVESTIGATING AND PUNISHING CPV MEMBERS AND GVN </p><p>     OFFICIALS WHO COMMIT MISTAKES AND ENGAGE IN WRONGDOING. </p><p>     GIVEN WIDESPREAD PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT MALFEASANCE AND </p><p>     GROWING CRIME, HOWEVER, IT IS DOUBTFUL IF THESE TOKEN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1302 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01485  02 OF 02  070942Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    ED-01    FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------B99FBF  070942Z /38 </p><p>R 070937Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6696 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 001485 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>     CASES WILL GO VERY FAR IN RE-BUILDING PUBLIC TRUST IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01485  02 OF 02  070942Z </p><p>     EITHER GVN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OR IN THE CPV\'S </p><p>     ABILITY TO POLICE ITSELF. </p><p>     PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
