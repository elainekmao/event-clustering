<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0147 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MAY 29, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for May 29, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Turkiye: During regular checks at the </p><p>entrance of Ercis township of Van, the jandarma </p><p>teams arrested Halise Batgi, a woman alleged to </p><p>be a PKK member. Carrying a false ID, Batgi was </p><p>planning to go to Ankara. It is claimed that she </p><p>would attend the PKK\'s organizational activities </p><p>and undertake terrorist attacks. Based on the </p><p>information obtained from Batgi during her </p><p>interrogation, another person, Sedat Senay, was </p><p>also arrested. Batgi and Senay were taken to the </p><p>State Security Court in Van after their </p><p>interrogations were concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet: The Assyrian origin citizens, who </p><p>migrated from Sarikoy village in Sirnak in the </p><p>mid-1990s due to terrorist events, are afraid to </p><p>return to their village because of the village </p><p>guards. The citizens, with Bishop Samuel Aktas in </p><p>Midyat of Mardin acting as the intermediary, </p><p>asked the governor to expel the village guards </p><p>from their houses. Assyrians have begun to return </p><p>due to the June 12, 2001 circular by former Prime </p><p>Minister Ecevit ordering the facilitation of the </p><p>return of Assyrians. The Assyrians are uneasy </p><p>about returning because of the obstacles created </p><p>by the village guards. In their petitions to the </p><p>governor, the villagers claimed the village </p><p>guards had occupied their homes and had been </p><p>cultivating their land and orchards, and their </p><p>property rights were also violated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Cumhuriyet: Sanliurfa, the "City of </p><p>Prophets," is expecting to be included in </p><p>UNESCO\'s decision determining the cities included </p><p>in the World Cultural Heritage Program. UNESCO </p><p>will evaluate sixteen cities in this category, </p><p>including Sanliurfa and Mardin, in its convention </p><p>between June 29-July 5. Sanliurfa and Mardin are </p><p>considered as important places for religious </p><p>tourism. Ismail Demir, Sanliurfa\'s Chamber of </p><p>Commerce and Industry President, and Sabri </p><p>Kurkcuglu, head of cultural and historical </p><p>studies on Sanliurfa, called upon all organized </p><p>institutions in town to be sensitive about the </p><p>issue prior UNESCO\'s decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Cumhuriyet: Members of the "Bible Society" </p><p>are delivering Kurdish copies of the Bible at a </p><p>stand they opened in Diyarbakir because of the </p><p>Cultural Festival in town. The Bible Society </p><p>publicizes the Bible, the Old Testament, and the </p><p>New Testament throughout the world. The </p><p>representative of the Bible Society, Behnan </p><p>Komutgan, said it was unfair to label them as </p><p>missionaries because the Bible Society members </p><p>are honorable Turkish citizens. Komutgan said the </p><p>first four chapters of the Bible were translated </p><p>into Kurdish under the name of "Mizgin" (Good </p><p>News), and the translation into Kurdish of the 27 </p><p>chapters of the entire Bible would be completed </p><p>by the end of the year. Komutgan added that the </p><p>Holy Books had been translated into 2,040 </p><p>different languages and accents in the world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Hurriyet/Radikal: Following the May 1 </p><p>earthquake in Bingol, 713 of 1,770 teachers in </p><p>Bingol province applied for a transfer to other </p><p>regions. As the Provincial Education Directorate </p><p>failed to persuade the teachers to stay in the </p><p>area for another year, the teachers\' petitions </p><p>for transfers will be submitted to the Ministry </p><p>of National Education on May 30. It is reported </p><p>that all of the teachers who have asked for a </p><p>transfer are homeless. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Hurriyet/Bolge: Because of demand by women, </p><p>the Adana City Council\'s Women Committee, the </p><p>Women Consultation Center, and the Association to </p><p>Establish Women Shelter Houses are working </p><p>together to open a "Women\'s Shelter House" in </p><p>Adana. The president of the association, Nurten </p><p>Mersinli, said the Adana Municipality promised to </p><p>support their efforts. </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Bolge: Adana\'s Provincial Director of the </p><p>Labor and Employment Department, Hasim Meydan, </p><p>said 7,783 workers were laid off during the first </p><p>four months of 2003. Meydan added his Department </p><p>had paid a total amount of three million USD to </p><p>eligible workers since the enforcement of the </p><p>"Unemployment Insurance Law."  Meydan gave the </p><p>number of registered jobless persons as 18,568 </p><p>compared to 16,770 last year. Meydan also </p><p>mentioned that his Department had found jobs for </p><p>2,807 persons in private and public sectors </p><p>during the same period. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
