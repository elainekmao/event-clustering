REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05581  01 OF 03  291557Z </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A SEPTEMBER 29 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, </p><p>MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI CALLED THE BOMBING OF MDC </p><p>HEADQUARTERS AND SUBSEQUENT RAIDS ON ITS OFFICES </p><p>"AMATEURISH."  THE GOZ HAS NO EVIDENCE AGAINST THE MDC </p><p>LEADERSHIP BUT WOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO PAINT THE PARTY </p><p>AS A SUBVERVISE ORGANIZATION.  TSVANGIRAI AGREED THAT THE </p><p>GOZ WAS TRYING TO USE THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT AS A </p><p>SCAPEGOAT, BUT THE MDC WOULD TRY TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT.  HE </p><p>LAMENTED THAT ZANU-PF MPS HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH THE MDC ON ISSUES OF CRITICAL NATIONAL </p><p>IMPORTANCE.  TSVANGIRAI EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE GOZ IS </p><p>USING WAR VETERANS AS A RESERVE ARMY, INDICATED BY THEIR </p><p>RECENT PLACEMENT UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>DEFENSE.  THE MDC PRESIDENT REPORTED THAT THE MDC IS </p><p>PLANNING A RALLY IN HARARE ON SEPTEMBER 30 TO CELEBRATE </p><p>THE PARTY\'S ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.  THE PARTY\'S EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE WOULD MEET SUBSEQUENTLY TO DISCUSS ORGANIZING </p><p>MASS ACTION.  THE AMBASSADOR URGED TSVANGIRAI TO EXERCISE </p><p>RESTRAINT AND CAUTION WHEN ORGANIZING SUCH ACTIVITIES. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI CALLED ON </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ON SEPTEMBER 29.  HE WAS ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY MDC CHAIRMAN ISAAC MATONGO AND SENIOR ADVISOR GANDI </p><p>MUDZINGWA.  THE AMBASSADOR WAS JOINED BY THE DCM AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05581  01 OF 03  291557Z </p><p>POLOFF. </p><p> </p><p>BOMBING AND RAIDS OF MDC OFFICES </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) TSVANGIRAI SAID HE HAD REQUESTED THE MEETING </p><p>BECAUSE HE WANTED TO TOUCH BASE AND TO RAISE SEVERAL </p><p>SPECIFIC POINTS.  FIRST, HE SAID, THE RECENT BOMBING OF </p><p>MDC HEADQUARTERS AND THE SUBSEQUENT SEARCH OF THE PARTY\'S </p><p>OFFICES HAD SIMPLY BEEN A PRETEXT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE </p><p>MDC\'S RECORDS AND STRATEGIES.  TSVANGIRAI REPORTED THAT </p><p>TWO PEOPLE HAD BEEN CHARGED IN THE CASE (NOTE: ON TWO </p><p>COUNTS OF TERRORISM AND SABOTAGE UNDER THE LAW AND ORDER </p><p>MAINTENANCE ACT. END NOTE) -- A SERVING POLICE OFFICER </p><p>(ZACHARIA NKOMO) AND AN MDC SECURITY OFFICIAL (SOLOMON </p><p>CHIKOWERO).  NKOMO, WHO ALLEGEDLY THREW THE GRENADE, HAD </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE MDC\'S YOUTH MOVEMENT BUT HAD NEVER </p><p>DONE SECURITY WORK FOR THE PARTY, AS ALLEGED BY THE GOZ. </p><p>THE GOZ, TSVANGIRAI INSISTED, WAS TRYING TO FABRICATE A </p><p>LINKAGE BETWEEN NKOMO AND CHIKOWERO, WHOM IT HAS ACCUSED </p><p>OF GIVING THE GRENADE TO NKOMO.  TSVANGIRAI SCOFFED AT </p><p>THE CHARGES AGAINST CHIKOWERO, WHO HAS BEEN RELEASED ON </p><p>BAIL, SAYING THE GOZ HAD NO EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM AND WAS </p><p>TRUMPING UP CHARGES AGAINST HIM TO JUSTIFY FURTHER ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE OPPOSITION PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  WHAT STEPS WAS THE GOZ PLANNING TO TAKE NEXT </p><p>AGAINST THE MDC, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED?  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>DESCRIBED THE WHOLE BOMBING INCIDENT AND SUBSEQUENT RAID </p><p>AS "AMATEURISH."  THE GOZ IS TRYING TO PAINT THE MDC AS A </p><p>SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION SO THAT IT CAN ARREST THE PARTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05581  01 OF 03  291557Z </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THEIR ATTEMPT HAS FAILED, AS THEY HAVE NO </p><p>EVIDENCE, BUT THEY WILL TRY AGAIN.  ASKED BY THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR WHETHER HE FEELS INCREASINGLY THREATENED, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI REPLIED THAT SOME IN THE GOZ WOULD LOVE TO SEE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HIM "DISAPPEAR FROM THE EARTH."  BRINGING THAT ABOUT, </p><p>HOWEVER, WOULD BE VERY RISKY FOR THE GOZ.  THE MDC WANTS </p><p>TO IMPROVE THE PROTECTION OF ITS LEADERSHIP, TSVANGIRAI </p><p>NOTED, AND HE HOPED HIS SECURITY DIRECTOR COULD CONTINUE </p><p>TO SEEK ADVICE FROM THE EMBASSY\'S NEW REGIONAL SECURITY </p><p>OFFICER, AS WAS DONE WITH HIS PREDECESSOR.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR STATED THAT, WITHIN OUR LIMITATIONS, WE WOULD </p><p>BE PLEASED TO CONTINUE TO ASSIST. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) TSVANGIRAI SAID ZIMBABWEANS ARE GETTING </p><p>INCREASINGLY ANGRY ABOUT THE CONTINUED DETERIORATION OF </p><p>THE ECONOMY.  THERE HAD BEEN SOME HOPE, HE NOTED, WHEN </p><p>THE NEW CABINET WAS APPOINTED, BUT THE ECONOMY HAS ONLY </p><p>WORSENED.  ALTHOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>SIMBA MAKONI AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INDUSTRY </p><p>MINISTER NKOSANA MOYO WERE CAPABLE, THEY ARE PART OF A </p><p>CORRUPT SYSTEM AND WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE NECESSARY </p><p>AUTHORITY TO MAKE DECISIONS.  THE MDC HAD PROVIDED THAT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3194 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05581  02 OF 03  291557Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------8BAED5  291557Z /38 </p><p>O 291559Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7241 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 005581 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/15/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MDC PRESIDENT TSVANGIRAI CALLS ON AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>ASSESSMENT TO THE IMF TEAM DURING ITS RECENT VISIT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05581  02 OF 03  291557Z </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) TSVANGIRAI RAISED THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT </p><p>(ZDA), NOTING THE GOZ\'S ATTEMPTS TO PORTRAY IT AS A </p><p>SANCTIONS BILL WHICH UNDERMINES THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY.  THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT GOZ OFFICIALS </p><p>HAVE TRIED TO USE THE ZDA AS A SCAPEGOAT FOR PROBLEMS OF </p><p>THEIR OWN MAKING.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THE ZDA CONVEYS A </p><p>VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE WHICH THE GOZ SHOULD TAKE TO </p><p>HEART.  ACCORDING TO TSVANGIRAI, THE MDC POSITION IS THAT </p><p>THE BILL LAYS OUT, ACCURATELY, THE UNFORTUNATE CURRENT </p><p>FACTS OF LIFE IN ZIMBABWE.  THE OPPOSITION PARTY, HE </p><p>SAID, WOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S REFUSAL TO </p><p>RESTORE AND ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW. </p><p> </p><p>PARLIAMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  TSVANGIRAI NOTED THAT THE MDC MEMBERS OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT HAD BEEN "RAISING LOTS OF VOICES," AND HE </p><p>APPEALED FOR ASSISTANCE AIMED AT STRENGTHENING PARLIAMENT </p><p>AS AN INSTITUTION.  THE AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED THE MDC\'S </p><p>WINNING OF 57 SEATS IN JUNE AS A VERY POSITIVE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT BUT EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT IT MAY BE </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR DEMOCRACY TO TAKE HOLD UNDER THE CURRENT </p><p>SERIOUS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  ZANU-PF, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI REPLIED, HAS NOT ACCEPTED THE ELECTION RESULTS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AND THAT IS WHY THE RULING PARTY CONTINUES TO BE SO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05581  02 OF 03  291557Z </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL.  HE LAMENTED THAT ZANU-PF MPS HAVE </p><p>EVINCED NO WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN BIPARTISAN </p><p>COOPERATION, EVEN ON ISSUES OF CRITICAL NATIONAL </p><p>IMPORTANCE, SUCH AS LAND, ECONOMY, AND RESTORATION OF THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW. </p><p> </p><p>WAR VETERANS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) TSVANGIRAI CLAIMED THAT THE GOZ IS USING WAR </p><p>VETERANS AS A RESERVE ARMY BECAUSE PRESIDENT MUGABE DOES </p><p>NOT TRUST THE REGULAR ARMY TO DO HIS DIRTY WORK. </p><p>THE RECENT PLACEMENT OF THE WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION </p><p>UNDER THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, HE SAID, FORMALIZES THEIR </p><p>MILITARY ROLE, WHICH WORRIES THE MDC A GREAT DEAL.  IN </p><p>THE MEANTIME, THE LAWLESSNESS CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>COUNTRY AND THE GOZ IS MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO CONTROL IT. </p><p> </p><p>MASS ACTION </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED TSVANGIRAI TO COMMENT ON </p><p>REPORTS OF THE MDC\'S INTENTION TO ORGANIZE SOME SORT OF </p><p>MASS ACTION.  THE PARTY, TSVANGIRAI REPLIED, IS PLANNING </p><p>TO HOLD A MID-DAY RALLY IN HARARE\'S RUFARO STADIUM ON </p><p>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 30 (NOTE: MDC CHAIRMAN ISAAC MATONGO </p><p>LATER TOLD DCM AND POLOFF THAT THE PARTY EXPECTS 50- </p><p>60,000 PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY TO ATTEND.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  THE PURPOSE OF THE RALLY IS TO CELEBRATE THE ONE- </p><p>YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE PARTY\'S FOUNDING, TO THANK MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR COURAGE DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05581  02 OF 03  291557Z </p><p>DISCUSS THE PARTY\'S NEXT STEPS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ASKED WHETHER STAYAWAYS WOULD BE ORGANIZED AFTER </p><p>THE RALLY, TSVANGIRAI SAID THEY WERE UNAVOIDABLE BUT THAT </p><p>NOTHING HAD BEEN PLANNED.  THE AMBASSADOR URGED THE MDC </p><p>TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT AND CAUTION IN PLANNING THE NEXT </p><p>STEPS.  THE OPPOSITION PARTY, HE POINTED OUT, HAS BEEN </p><p>SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT HAS MAINTAINED PUBLIC FOCUS ON </p><p>ISSUES WHICH MATTER TO MOST ZIMBABWEANS, WITHOUT TRYING </p><p>TO INFLAME AN ALREADY EXPLOSIVE SITUATION.  HE EXPRESSED </p><p>HOPE THAT THE PARTY WOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE THIS APPROACH </p><p>AND WOULD NOT GIVE THE GOVERNMENT AN EXCUSE TO CRACK </p><p>DOWN.  TSVANGIRAI ACCEPTED THE POINT, BUT SAID HE WAS IN </p><p>A DELICATE POSITION -- PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE </p><p>ANGRY AND ARE DEMANDING ACTION, AS THE CURRENT COURSE OF </p><p>EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE IS UNSUSTAINABLE.  THE SEPTEMBER 30 </p><p>RALLY, HE SAID, WOULD SET THE TONE FOR A SUBSEQUENT </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING, WHICH WOULD DECIDE ON THE </p><p>PARTY\'S FUTURE ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE DCM ASKED FOR TSVANGIRAI\'S ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S CURRENT THINKING ON THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION -- IS HE CONSIDERING STEPPING DOWN </p><p>OR WOULD HE SERVE OUT HIS TERM.  HE HAS SEEN NO </p><p>INDICATION, TSVANGIRAI RESPONDED, THAT MUGABE WILL STEP </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3196 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05581  03 OF 03  291557Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------8BAEDD  291557Z /38 </p><p>O 291559Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7242 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 005581 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/15/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MDC PRESIDENT TSVANGIRAI CALLS ON AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>DOWN.  THE ZANU-PF EXTRAORDINARY CONGRESS LATER THIS YEAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05581  03 OF 03  291557Z </p><p>WOULD FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE SUCCESSION ISSUE, AND WAS </p><p>POTENTIALLY A WATERSHED EVENT.  HE THOUGHT MUGABE WOULD </p><p>SERVE OUT HIS TERM BUT WOULD AGREE THAT SOMEONE ELSE -- </p><p>UNDER HIS CONTROL OR INFLUENCE -- SHOULD CONTEST THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE DCM EXPRESSED SOME SKEPTICISM </p><p>ABOUT THAT SCENARIO, EMPHASIZING THAT A DECISION TO SERVE </p><p>OUT HIS TERM BUT NOT TO STAND FOR REELECTION COULD MAKE </p><p>MUGABE A LAME DUCK DURING HIS FINAL TWO YEARS IN OFFICE. </p><p>ASKED WHETHER MUGABE IS GROOMING FINANCE MINISTER MAKONI </p><p>AS HIS SUCCESSOR, TSVANGIRAI WAS DOUBTFUL, SAYING THAT </p><p>MAKONI DOES NOT HAVE A STRONG POLITICAL BASE.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>AFFIRMED THAT MUGABE\'S DEPARTURE IS INEVITABLE AND THAT </p><p>HE MUST BE PERSUADED TO RETIRE.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT HE </p><p>HAS NOTHING TO LOSE BY EMPLOYING CONFRONTATION AND WILL </p><p>ONLY RESPOND TO PRESSURE.  THAT, TSVANGIRAI STRESSED, IS </p><p>WHY MASS ACTION IS NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) TSVANGIRAI WAS SOMEWHAT CALMER THAN THE LAST </p><p>TIME WE MET WITH HIM, BUT CLEARLY VERY WORRIED ABOUT </p><p>RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS.  IT WAS </p><p>OBVIOUS FROM HIS COMMENTS THAT THE MDC IS FEELING INTENSE </p><p>PRESSURE FROM ITS SUPPORTERS NATIONWIDE TO TAKE A FIRM </p><p>STAND AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO TURN THE </p><p>ECONOMY AROUND AND TO RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW.  HE IS </p><p>UNDERSTANDABLY RELUCTANT, HOWEVER, TO ENCOURAGE LARGE- </p><p>SCALE PROTESTS FOR FEAR OF UNLEASHING A GOVERNMENT </p><p>CRACKDOWN THAT COULD TURN BLOODY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE </p><p>MDC RISKS LOSING LEGITIMACY IF IT DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05581  03 OF 03  291557Z </p><p>ANGER AND FRUSTRATION OF ITS CONSTITUENTS.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>AND THE REST OF THE MDC ARE CLEARLY BETWEEN A ROCK AND A </p><p>HARD PLACE.  THE SEPTEMBER 30 RALLY, AND THE LIKELY </p><p>DEMANDS FOR ACTION BY THOSE IN ATTENDANCE, WILL BE A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT TEST OF THE MDC LEADERSHIP\'S METTLE. </p><p>MEANWHILE, WE HAVE ADVISED EMBASSY STAFF AND THE AMERICAN </p><p>COMMUNITY TO AVOID THE AREA NEAR THE STADIUM ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>30. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
