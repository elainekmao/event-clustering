<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002232 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES/STC HART, OES/ENV RICHARD, OES/PCI PAYNE, </p><p>NEA/ARN ZIADEH </p><p>DEPT PASS USAID EGAT WILSON </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR SAUMS </p><p>DEPT PASS USEPA/OIA FERRANTE, PASAREW </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: TSPL, SENV, ETRD, AMGT, APER, KSCA, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  JORDAN - REQUEST FOR 2003 EMBASSY SCIENCE </p><p>FELLOW </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 53545 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  Post welcomes the opportunity to further USG </p><p>environmental and trade objectives in Jordan and requests </p><p>an Embassy Science Fellow from EPA for up to three months </p><p>during the summer of 2003.  The fellow will provide </p><p>technical assistance to the recently created Ministry of </p><p>Environment, particularly focusing on helping Jordan </p><p>develop the most effective and efficient environmental </p><p>regulatory agency.  All anticipated work and meetings </p><p>with Jordanian officials could be conducted in English. </p><p>(Please note that, because of regional security concerns, </p><p>Embassy Amman is currently on authorized departure.  The </p><p>security situation is under continuous review, and </p><p>decisions about summer staffing will reflect an up-to- </p><p>date assessment of the situation.)  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO FTA ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Environmental regulatory policy has become an </p><p>increasingly important bilateral issue in the context of </p><p>U.S. trade agreements.  To wit, the Jordan FTA has an </p><p>annex and side agreement which obligate the parties to </p><p>uphold and enforce existing environmental laws and </p><p>regulations.  The Joint Environmental Forum, a component </p><p>of the FTA environmental commitments, is expected to meet </p><p>within the next few months to discuss how best to address </p><p>the FTA obligations.  Some of those discussions will </p><p>cover capacity-building needs of the new Ministry of </p><p>Environment.  Having an EPA science fellow on the ground </p><p>in Amman this coming summer would be an excellent </p><p>opportunity to push forward our agenda.  Based on the </p><p>Environmental Forum discussions, post\'s Environmental HUB </p><p>office -- with input from the USAID Mission\'s water and </p><p>economic opportunity offices -- will develop a detailed </p><p>set of work objectives for the fellow. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>BUILDING JORDAN\'S ENVIRONMENTAL CAPACITY </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. Post is keen to recruit an EPA fellow to help advise </p><p>the new Ministry of Environment on its mission, </p><p>organizational structure, substantive components, budget </p><p>allocations, human resources and capacity.  Additionally, </p><p>the fellow could help Jordanian environment officials </p><p>build effective working relationships with other </p><p>Jordanian agencies with economic policy responsibilities. </p><p>Taking a global look at the state of environmental </p><p>governance in Jordan, the science fellow should have the </p><p>general expertise necessary to counsel the government on </p><p>how to structure an effective and efficient environmental </p><p>regulatory body.  Perhaps drawing on EPA\'s experience in </p><p>other developing countries seeking to build appropriate </p><p>environment ministries, the fellow could offer some </p><p>models Jordan may wish to consider. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The successful EPA candidate can also draw on a </p><p>recent assessment of Jordan\'s environmental management </p><p>capacity conducted by an USAID contractor to gain a </p><p>better understanding of environmental governance in </p><p>Jordan and to determine areas and issues that need the </p><p>most immediate attention.  We would expect the EPA fellow </p><p>to have daily contact with Jordanian Ministry of </p><p>Environment personnel, as well as routine interaction </p><p>with other government officials, members of Jordan\'s </p><p>environmental NGO community and academics.  Meetings can </p><p>be conducted in English. </p><p> </p><p>5.  With EPA\'s vast expertise in environmental regulation </p><p>and enforcement, particularly the international work it </p><p>has done to build the capacity of foreign environmental </p><p>agencies, we expect our science fellow to bring unique </p><p>and valuable consultations to Jordan, one of our most </p><p>strategic partners in the Middle East.  Conversely, this </p><p>fellowship offers the selected candidate an excellent </p><p>opportunity for additional international experience, </p><p>networking, and high-level policy dialog. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Point of contact:  NEA Regional Environment Officer </p><p>Paul Malik. </p><p>Email:  malikp@state.gov </p><p>Tel:  962-6-592-0101 ext 2621 </p><p>Fax:  962-7-592-7653 </p><p>Workweek is Sunday-Thursday </p><p> </p><p>7.  Office Space/Security Clearances:  Post can provide </p><p>office space and unclassified computer access.  The </p><p>science fellow is required to have a secret clearance for </p><p>unescorted access within the embassy. </p><p> </p><p>8. Housing/Transportation:  Post will make an effort to </p><p>offer embassy housing to the science fellow, utilizing a </p><p>vacated apartment during the summer turnover season. </p><p>However, post will have to confirm housing availability </p><p>as the fellowship approaches. </p><p> </p><p>9. Embassy Services:  The science fellow will have access </p><p>to post medical services, CLO, APO, check-cashing </p><p>services, and for a fee can join AECSA-the recreational </p><p>association-with access to the commissary, pool, and </p><p>snack bar. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
