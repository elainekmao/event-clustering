<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000462 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, CU, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM: CASTRO VISITS HANOI - ACCORDING TO A </p><p>--          (HASTY) SCRIPT </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  Hanoi 264 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Cuban President Fidel Castro and an </p><p>entourage of over 100 government and business officials made </p><p>a "successful" and carefully scripted visit to Hanoi from </p><p>February 21-23, on his way to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) </p><p>summit in Kuala Lumpur.  This was Castor\'s third visit to </p><p>Vietnam (previous visits were in 1973 and 1995).  The </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) announced the visit only </p><p>24 hours in advance.  The visit generated significant press </p><p>coverage but there did not appear to be much interest among </p><p>the general public.  Castro\'s visit "cemented bonds" between </p><p>two traditional friends.  "Multi-faceted" bilateral </p><p>cooperation, especially on the political and economic </p><p>fronts, appeared to be the main focus; Castro also found </p><p>time to denounce US policy on Iraq.  Communist Party of </p><p>Vietnam (CPV) General Secretary Nong Duc Manh called for an </p><p>"immediate end" to the Cuban embargo.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>VISIT A SURPRISE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The MFA announced on the afternoon of February 20 </p><p>that Castro would be visiting Hanoi February 21-23.  Even by </p><p>GVN standards, this was exceptionally short notice for a </p><p>major state visit.  Several third country embassy contacts </p><p>as well as senior UN officials said that they were also </p><p>surprised by the MFA\'s announcement.  An MFA Americas Desk </p><p>official who was not directly involved in the visit claimed </p><p>that the short notice was "not significant."  According to </p><p>the Americas Desk, the visit had been planned for a long </p><p>time, but the exact timing was in doubt until very recently. </p><p>Colonel Tran Nhung, International Department Director of the </p><p>"People\'s Army" newspaper said that even the GVN\'s top </p><p>leadership only knew about the visit three days in advance. </p><p>Colonel Nhung opined that the main reasons for the short </p><p>notice were (1) Cuban "obsession" with security and (2) the </p><p>Cuban government\'s "typical indecisiveness as reflected by </p><p>Castro\'s working style."  A contact at the Mexican Embassy </p><p>suggested that the current Cuban ambassador, who is "very </p><p>close to Fidel," might have influenced him to stop in Hanoi </p><p>on his way to the NAM summit. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Despite the apparently short notice, the GVN put </p><p>together a very busy program for Castro, who looked "quite </p><p>frail" according to press reports.  The program included a </p><p>series of meetings with top officials, including CPV General </p><p>Secretary Nong Duc Manh; Prime Minister Phan Van Khai; State </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>President Tran Duc Luong; and National Assembly Chairman </p><p>Nguyen Van An.  Castro also met with former CPV General </p><p>Secretaries Do Muoi and Le Kha Phieu; former President Le </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Duc Anh, and General Vo Nguyen Giap, according to press </p><p>reports.  Other events included a cultural performance at </p><p>the Hanoi Opera House; ceremonies at the Ho Chi Minh </p><p>mausoleum and Jose Marti statue; a visit to an electronics </p><p>plant on the outskirts of Hanoi; and a speech to students at </p><p>the Hanoi Polytecnic University. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>DISCUSSION TOPICS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  MFA Latin American Desk officials involved in the </p><p>Castro visit told Pol FSN they are all "too busy" to discuss </p><p>the substance, if any, to the visit.  However, it appears </p><p>that Castro\'s meetings focused mainly exchanging ideas on a </p><p>number of bilateral issues.  One unconfirmed rumor picked up </p><p>by the embassy is that Castro made a plea to the GVN senior </p><p>leadership for additional economic assistance due to the </p><p>dire state of Cuba\'s economy.  (Note:  During PM Khai\'s </p><p>visit to Cuba in October 2002 (reftel), Vietnam agreed to </p><p>sell additional rice to Cuba.  In 2002, Vietnam exported </p><p>125,000 tons of rice to Cuba; the total volume for 2003 is </p><p>expected to rise to 150,000 tons, apparently on "easy </p><p>payment" terms.  (End Note)  According to Colonel Nhung, </p><p>Castro\'s meetings with the GVN and CPV leadership included: </p><p>(1) exchanging views on the NAM summit; (2) discussing </p><p>Vietnam\'s views on current issues such as Iraq and North </p><p>Korea; and (3) obtaining the GVN\'s thoughts on how Vietnam\'s </p><p>economic renovation policies might be applied to Cuba. </p><p>While other areas, such as economic cooperation, received </p><p>some attention, Colonel Nhung said that he "doubted" that </p><p>those discussions were "more than general;" as far as he </p><p>knew, there were no concrete bilateral agreements.  The </p><p>bilateral relationship is "strong and established and there </p><p>are really no outstanding bilateral issues between us, </p><p>Colonel Nhung claimed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  According to press reports, both sides would like </p><p>to improve two-way trade, which amounted to only about USD </p><p>48 million in 2002.  However, Colonel Nhung said that </p><p>"substantial improvement" in this sector is "unlikely in the </p><p>near future" due to the ailing Cuban economy.  He opined </p><p>that the US embargo has "really hurt" Cuba\'s economy. </p><p>Indeed, during the visit, CPV General Secretary Manh </p><p>denounced the US embargo and said that it should "be ended </p><p>immediately," according to a press report.  Le Linh Lan, </p><p>head of the MFA\'s Institute of International Relations </p><p>Institute for International Relations Center for Euro - </p><p>American Studies said separately that the visit was "mainly </p><p>symbolic."  Lan opined that, while there were "probably a </p><p>few minor interministerial agreements as well as "some" </p><p>business contracts, the poor state of Cuba\'s economy is an </p><p>overriding factor that limits the possibility of a stronger </p><p>economic relationship. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>IRAQ DISCUSSION - AS EXPECTED </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  According to Colonel Nhung and press reports, </p><p>Castro and Vietnam\'s leadership discussed Iraq.  One press </p><p>report noted that both sides called for a diplomatic </p><p>solution based on "respect for Iraq\'s independence, </p><p>sovereignty, and territorial integrity, in keeping with the </p><p>UN Charter and international laws."  (Comment:  This is very </p><p>much in line with prior GVN statements on the Iraq issue. </p><p>End Comment)  Colonel Nhung claimed that both sides </p><p>"completely agree" on Iraq; he predicted that the NAM summit </p><p>will also reflect their "solidarity" concerning Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>VISIT GENERATED LITTLE PUBLIC INTEREST </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  While State-controlled broadcast and print media </p><p>gave the Castro visit widespread coverage, there appeared </p><p>little discernable public interest.  At the Hanoi Opera </p><p>House cultural performance on February 22, poloff observed a </p><p>"crowd" of perhaps 250 people waiting on sidewalks adjacent </p><p>to the Opera House for Castro\'s arrival.  About 10-15 </p><p>percent appeared to be tourists from nearby hotels.  Two </p><p>university students said that they "were excited" about the </p><p>visit because "Fidel is a great friend of Vietnam."  The </p><p>event, attended by many senior diplomats was scheduled to </p><p>begin at 9:00 PM; however, the guest of honor, preceded by </p><p>the GVN and CPV leadership and accompanied by what looked </p><p>like a platoon of very large Cuban security personnel, did </p><p>not arrive until nearly 10:30.  The ambassador of Japan </p><p>apparently ran out of patience and was seen leaving the </p><p>venue at about 9:40.  Reportedly, a number of senior </p><p>diplomats chose not to attend the performance due to the </p><p>last minute invitations.  At the February 23 ceremony at the </p><p>Ho Chi Minh mausoleum, poloff observed perhaps 50 onlookers, </p><p>(kept at least 250 meters from the mausoleum); at least 20 </p><p>were PRC tourists on a group tour.  Castro\'s speech at the </p><p>Hanoi Polytechnic University on February 23 drew a crowd of </p><p>students and government officials estimated at 3,000, but, </p><p>according to a press report, many of the attendees were </p><p>"encouraged" to attend the event.  Colonel Nhung attributed </p><p>the lack of demonstrative public interest to (1) a decline </p><p>in Cuba\'s relevancy to Vietnam over the past 15 years and </p><p>(2) people generally have become more used to "all types of </p><p>foreign visits." </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>WHAT\'S NEXT? </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Reftel reported that Party Secretary Manh may </p><p>visit Cuba in 2003.  According to press reports, Castro </p><p>reiterated the invitation and Manh "happily accepted." </p><p>Colonel Nhung predicted that Manh\'s visit is "more likely" </p><p>to take place in 2004 because National Assembly Chairman </p><p>Nguyen Van An "will probably" visit Cuba in late March or </p><p>early April in conjunction with his attending the April 6-12 </p><p>Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Santiago, Chile. </p><p>Following the NAM summit, Castro will visit China.  Although </p><p>not announced in the local press, Castro will also visit </p><p>Japan on March 1 and 2, according to Japanese emboffs. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  The last minute nature of this visit invites </p><p>speculation that Castro needed some convincing to visit </p><p>arguably his oldest friend, despite having visited here only </p><p>twice since he came to power in 1959.  In contrast, another </p><p>"old friend," Palestine Authority President Yasser Arafat, </p><p>has visited Vietnam about 20 times.  While it seems likely </p><p>that the close bilateral relationship (as well as the </p><p>solidarity rhetoric) between two of the five remaining </p><p>communist countries will continue, we predict that Vietnam </p><p>will maintain its path of trying to become a more </p><p>significant player in the mainstream diplomatic community, </p><p>focusing on oft-stated goals such as WTO accession and a </p><p>seat on the UN Security Council. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
