<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008740 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/29/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: DESPITE REFORM EFFORTS, HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITY </p><p>WARY OF NEW GOT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8586 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Turkey\'s three leading human rights </p><p>organizations are wary of the new GOT, despite its nascent </p><p>reform efforts (reftel).  One of the groups, which is </p><p>Islam-oriented, suspects the ruling AK Party will avoid </p><p>promoting Islamic rights; the others, leftist and Kurdish </p><p>oriented, fear AK will pursue a hidden Islamic agenda at </p><p>their expense.  A controversial police inspector report may </p><p>present the first test of the GOT\'s commitment to progress on </p><p>human rights.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>MAZLUM-DER: AK IGNORING ISLAMIC ISSUES </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Yilmaz Ensaroglu, chairman of Mazlum-Der, an </p><p>Islam-oriented human rights organization, told poloff he is </p><p>not convinced that the ruling AK Party, despite its perceived </p><p>Islamist roots, will promote religious freedom.  He said AK </p><p>leaders are making every effort to avoid issues related to </p><p>Islam, such as the wearing of headscarves in universities and </p><p>government offices.  He noted that the new government </p><p>includes more ministers formerly from the center-right ANAP </p><p>party than from the (now closed) Islamist Fazilet Party. </p><p>Even the openly Islamist former PM Erbakan made no progress </p><p>on the rights of Muslims -- during his brief tenure large </p><p>numbers of students were expelled from universities for </p><p>wearing Islamic headcover -- and it is unlikely AK will do </p><p>better.  The GOT\'s proposed legislative reform package does </p><p>not appear to include many Islam-related issues.  AK Party, </p><p>he said, appears more focused on staying in power than on </p><p>promoting the rights of pious Muslims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) When pressed, however, Ensaroglu acknowledged there </p><p>are indications the new administration could be more </p><p>supportive of human rights reform than its predecessor, even </p><p>if reform is not focused on Islamic issues.  He is very </p><p>pleased that DPM Yalcinbayir was given the human rights </p><p>portfolio.  He said Yalcinbayir was a strong advocate of </p><p>human rights reform during his tenure on the parliamentary </p><p>Constitutional Committee, often clashing with ANAP leader </p><p>Mesut Yilmaz, who was less supportive of human rights in </p><p>Ensaroglu\'s view.  The current 550-member Parliament includes </p><p>10-15 deputies sensitive to human rights issues; if the right </p><p>people are selected for the key committees, they could make </p><p>an impact.  He said an "outrageous" report by police </p><p>inspectors released November 28 presents the new </p><p>administration with its first human rights test.  The report </p><p>absolves police officers from charges of beating a student </p><p>during a November demonstration in Ankara, despite the fact </p><p>that the incident was captured by TV cameras, and instead </p><p>blames the police official who freed the student.  He said </p><p>the government\'s response to this travesty will provide an </p><p>indication of its sincerity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>HRA/HRF: AK HAS HIDDEN ISLAMIC AGENDA </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Husnu Ondul, chairman of the leftist, Kurdish oriented </p><p>Human Rights Association, and Yavuz Onen, chairman of the </p><p>Human Rights Foundation (affiliated with the Association) </p><p>view the issue of AK and Islam from the opposite angle.  They </p><p>suspect AK has a hidden Islamic agenda.  Obviously, they </p><p>argue, AK is planning Islam-related reforms, but no one knows </p><p>what they are.  Ondul was the most dismissive of the proposed </p><p>reform package, asserting that no administration could </p><p>introduce a package without the endorsement of the Deep </p><p>State.  New legislation might look good on paper, but would </p><p>not be faithfully implemented.  Onen noted that the reform </p><p>package did not appear to address many Kurdish issues, or the </p><p>problems of the southeast in general.  AK does not have a </p><p>good image among the Kurds, having opposed previous reforms </p><p>relating to Kurdish language rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Though HRA, HRF, and Mazlum-Der are broad-based, </p><p>nationwide organizations, each has a discrete agenda.  They </p><p>are reluctant to recognize reforms not focused on the issues </p><p>most important for their members.  They are also </p><p>understandably skeptical of AK\'s ability to implement its </p><p>proposals, having been burned by past reform efforts that </p><p>failed to live up to expectations. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
