<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ROME 005198 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE; EUR/ERA; EB/ECS; NEA/NGA; NEA/ENA </p><p>DEPT PLS PASS TO IRAN COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05/19/07 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PREL, UNSC, PTER, KPRP, IR, IZ, LY, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY: A MORE ACTIVIST POLICY TOWARD ROGUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ROME 167; (B) ROME 269; (C) ROME 565; (D) ROME 2005; </p><p>(E) ROME 4433; (F) ROME 3754; (G) ROME 4195; (H) ROME 2752 </p><p>(AND PREVIOUS); (K) ROME 3498; (L) ROME 1952; (M) ROME 2566; </p><p>(N) 96ROME12210; (O) 96ROME10301; (P) ROME 4641 (Q) 96ROME 9494 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY:  DCM JAMES CUNNINGHAM.  REASON 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  RECENT GOI ACTIVITY SUGGESTS ITALY IS </p><p>PURSUING MORE ACTIVIST POLICIES TOWARD THE SO-CALLED "ROGUE" </p><p>STATES:  IRAN, IRAQ, AND LIBYA.  ACCORDING TO THE MFA, ITALY </p><p>HAS, IN FACT, A SINGLE, BROAD POLICY FOR THESE COUNTRIES, </p><p>CENTERED UPON THE BELIEF THAT ENGAGEMENT, NOT ISOLATION, IS </p><p>THE BEST WAY TO MODERATE "ROGUE" BEHAVIOR AND SPURRED ON BY </p><p>THE DESIRE TO PROMOTE FUTURE ECONOMIC/COMMERCIAL TIES AS WELL </p><p>AS SECURE ITALIAN ENERGY SUPPLIES.  FOREIGN MINISTER DINI HAS </p><p>SAID ISOLATING TEHRAN, BAGHDAD, AND TRIPOLI WILL NOT SOLVE </p><p>ANYTHING -- AND THAT A "GLOBAL AND PRODUCTIVE APPROACH BASED </p><p>ON DIALOGUE" IS NEEDED.  ITALY\'S DESIRE TO EXPAND COMMERCIAL </p><p>TIES, ALONG WITH ITS ENERGY DEPENDENCE, COMPLEMENT DINI\'S </p><p>PERSPECTIVE.  THE GOI KNOWS THAT ITS POSITIONS VIS-A-VIS IRAN, </p><p>IRAQ, AND LIBYA IRRITATE THE U.S., AND HAS BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO </p><p>PUSH THE ENVELOPE TOO FAR.  ITALY BELIEVES ITS POLICIES ARE IN </p><p>LINE WITH THE ACTIONS OF OTHER EU MEMBERS, SUCH AS GERMANY AND </p><p>FRANCE, AND IS NEWLY WILLING TO CHARACTERIZE POLICY </p><p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE U.S. AS "IRRECONCILABLE."  WE ARE NOT </p><p>GOING TO FIND MUCH TO AGREE ON WHEN WE GET BEYOND </p><p>GENERALITIES.  WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS, NONETHELESS, IN DEFLECTING </p><p>ITALIAN POLICY, AND BY CONTINUING TO LEAN INTO ITALIAN </p><p>POLITICIANS, AND BY REMINDING THEM OF THEIR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBLIGATIONS, WE CAN CONTINUE TO CONDITION ITALIAN </p><p>BEHAVIOR...UP TO A POINT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DINI\'S PERSPECTIVE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) FM DINI OUTLINED HIS VIEW TOWARD THE ROGUE STATES IN A </p><p>DECEMBER 1996 ARTICLE (WRITTEN BY MFA MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR </p><p>CLAUDIO PACIFICO AND HIS DEPUTY, DIEGO BRASIOLI) IN THE TRADE </p><p>MAGAZINE "ENERGY."  IN SHORT, DINI SAID THAT ISOLATING IRAN, </p><p>IRAQ, AND LIBYA BEHIND "HIGH WALLS OF SAND" WILL NOT SOLVE </p><p>ANYTHING -- AND THAT A "GLOBAL AND PRODUCTIVE APPROACH BASED </p><p>ON DIALOGUE" IS NEEDED.  OTHERWISE, HE ARGUED, THERE\'S A RISK </p><p>THAT A DIVIDE WILL DEVELOP ON "DEMOGRAPHIC, CULTURAL, AND </p><p>ECONOMIC" LINES BETWEEN THE TWO SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. </p><p>DINI OUTLINED THE "INTERESTS IN PLAY," NOTING THAT SIX OF </p><p>ITALY\'S TOP SEVEN OIL SUPPLIERS ARE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND </p><p>NORTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAN: MYKONOS DELAYS REOPENING? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE MYKONOS TRIAL VERDICTS HAVE INTERRUPTED THE EU\'S </p><p>RELATIONS WITH IRAN, AND HAVE SLOWED -- FOR NOW -- ITALY\'S </p><p>PUSH FOR BROADER ECONOMIC/COMMERCIAL RELATIONS THERE.  THE GOI </p><p>WAS NOT DISPLEASED TO FIND ITSELF FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME </p><p>IN MAY AS THE ONLY EU PARTNER WITH AN AMBASSADOR IN PLACE BUT </p><p>WAS DEEPLY PUZZLED BY IRANIAN FM VELAYATI\'S REFUSAL TO SEE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ORTONA.  (NOTE: ORTONA WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECALLED TO </p><p>SUPPORT EU SOLIDARITY.)  IN JANUARY, VELAYATI MADE A HIGHLY </p><p>PUBLICIZED TRIP TO ROME WHERE HE MET WITH PRIME MINISTER PRODI </p><p>AND DINI (REFS A-B).  THE APPARENT PURPOSE OF THE VISIT WAS TO </p><p>RELAUNCH BILATERAL ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS.  ONE </p><p>PRESS REPORT INDICATED THAT POLITICAL APPROVAL HAD BEEN GIVEN </p><p>FOR A GRADUAL AND LIMITED OPENING OF EXPORT CREDIT INSURANCE </p><p>BY ITALY\'S EXPORT CREDIT AGENCY, SACE.  VELAYATI TOLD THE </p><p>PRESS THAT "ITALY CAN BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL, </p><p>ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PARTNERS OF IRAN."  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>PRESS, IRAN WOULD OFFER ITALY CONTRACTS FOR USD 12 BILLION AS </p><p>PART OF IRAN\'S 1995-2000 DEVELOPMENT PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BEFORE THE MYKONOS VERDICTS, THE GOI WAS EXPLORING HOW </p><p>IT MIGHT REOPEN OFFICIAL TRADE CREDITS TO TEHRAN WITHOUT </p><p>UPSETTING THE U.S. (REF C).  AMONG THE OPTIONS, THE MFA WAS </p><p>WEIGHING ROLLING OVER IRANIAN DEBT REPAYMENTS INTO NEW TRADE </p><p>COVERAGE TO BOOST EXPORTS AND TO HELP EASE ITALY\'S USD 1.2 </p><p>BILLION TRADE IMBALANCE WITH IRAN, AS WELL AS TO AVOID </p><p>DISRUPTION OF IRAN\'S DEBT REPAYMENTS TO ITALY.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE HAD BEEN PREPARING TO LEAD AN </p><p>ITALIAN DELEGATION TO THE FIRST MEETING IN SEVEN YEARS OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN-IRANIAN MIXED ECONOMIC COMMISSION IN TEHRAN (REF D). </p><p>MFA "NEA" ECONOMIC DIRECTOR FRANCESCO TRUPIANO TOLD EMBOFFS IN </p><p>MID-MAY THAT BECAUSE OF MYKONOS, THE GOI WAS NOT/NOT </p><p>CONSIDERING NEW OFFICIAL CREDITS (INCLUDING ROLLING OVER </p><p>REPAYMENTS) AND THAT THE MIXED COMMISSION WAS INDEFINITELY </p><p>SUSPENDED.  TRUPIANO CONFIRMED THIS WAS STILL THE CASE JUNE 5, </p><p>NOTING THAT HE DISAGREED WITH ITALIAN PRESS REPORTS THAT THE </p><p>RECENT IRANIAN ELECTION REPRESENTED A MAJOR POSITIVE CHANGE; </p><p>HE WILL WANT TO WAIT AND SEE HOW IRANIAN POLICIES ACTUALLY </p><p>CHANGE IN PRACTICE BEFORE MAKING SUCH A CONCLUSION.  IF </p><p>POLITICAL CONDITIONS DO IN FACT IMPROVE, HE SAID, THE GOI WILL </p><p>RE-EXAMINE THE QUESTION OF EXPORT CREDITS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DESPITE THE MAY 19 SECOND RECALL OF AMBASSADOR ORTONA </p><p>FROM IRAN (REF E), ORTONA\'S INITIAL QUICK RETURN TO IRAN AFTER </p><p>MYKONOS ILLUSTRATES GOI DESIRE TO RESUME BUSINESS AS USUAL </p><p>WITH TEHRAN.  BEFORE ORTONA\'S RETURN, MFA OFFICIAL TRUPIANO </p><p>TOLD EMBOFFS THAT HE PERSONALLY HOPED ORTONA WOULD REMAIN IN </p><p>TEHRAN -- IF ONLY FOR ECONOMIC REASONS.  ANOTHER MFA POLITICAL </p><p>DIRECTORATE SOURCE TOLD US ITALY HOPED, BY KEEPING ORTONA IN </p><p>PLACE, EVEN TO PICK UP LUCRATIVE CONTRACTS GERMAN COMPANIES </p><p>MAY LOSE BECAUSE OF THE FREEZE IN GERMAN-IRANIAN RELATIONS. </p><p>TRUPIANO REITERATED FAMILIAR MFA THEMES THAT IRAN OWES 4.5 </p><p>TRILLION LIRE (USD 3 BILLION) TO SACE, PLUS ANOTHER USD 1 </p><p>BILLION TO ITALIAN FIRMS FROM THE SHAH PERIOD.  FOR THE </p><p>MOMENT, IRAN IS MEETING ITS DEBT REPAYMENTS IN FULL -- </p><p>INCLUDING PRINCIPAL -- BUT IF ITALY PULLS BACK FROM IRAN, IT </p><p>FEARS TEHRAN WILL CUT ITS REPAYMENTS.  TRUPIANO COMMENTED THAT </p><p>IT WAS EASY FOR DENMARK AND SWEDEN TO CALL FOR TOUGH EU </p><p>MEASURES AGAINST TEHRAN BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY AN </p><p>ECONOMIC PRICE AS ITALY WOULD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OPENLY SEEKING BUSINESS WITH IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ITALY IS LOOKING TO POSITION ITSELF COMMERCIALLY IN </p><p>BAGHDAD -- THE MOMENT UN SANCTIONS ARE LIFTED.  THE MFA LIKES </p><p>TO REMIND US THAT IRAQ WAS AN IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNER AND </p><p>ENERGY SOURCE FOR ITALY BEFORE THE GULF WAR.  OVER THE LAST </p><p>MONTH, TWO HIGH-PROFILE IRAQI DELEGATIONS HAVE VISITED ROME, </p><p>OSTENSIBLY TO DISCUSS PERMITTED COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES UNDER </p><p>UNSCR 986 (REFS F-G).  IRAQI OIL MINISTER AMIR RASHID WAS THE </p><p>MOST NOTABLE VISITOR.  FM DINI AND INDUSTRY MINISTER BERSANI </p><p>MET RASHID AFTER "PRESSURE" FROM ITALIAN OIL INTERESTS AND </p><p>IRAQ, ACCORDING TO MFA ECONOMIC DG DI ROBERTO; RASHID ALSO </p><p>CALLED ON THE PRESIDENT OF PARASTATAL PETROLEUM PRODUCER AGIP. </p><p>DI ROBERTO AND INDUSTRY DG FOR BASIC ENERGY ETTORE ROSSONI </p><p>SAID RASHID\'S DISCUSSIONS INCLUDED NOT ONLY UNSCR 986, BUT </p><p>POST-SANCTIONS OIL IMPORTS AND NEW OIL PRODUCTION FACILITIES </p><p>IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) IRAQ\'S DEPUTY OIL MINISTER -- SAMI SHARUF SHEBAB -- </p><p>FOLLOWED UP RASHID\'S VISIT WITH A SERIES OF MAY 14 MEETINGS </p><p>WITH ITALIAN BUSINESSMEN AND PARLIAMENTARIANS.  U/S PATRICIA </p><p>TOIA SAW SHEBAB AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY BUT, ACCORDING TO AN </p><p>MFA SOURCE, DECLINED TO ATTEND A LATER PRESS CONFERENCE WITH </p><p>SHEBAB AS SCHEDULED DUE TO HIS "ABRASIVENESS" DURING THE </p><p>MEETING.  THIS SOURCE CALLED SHEBAB "AGGRESSIVE" IN HIS </p><p>INSISTENCE THAT ITALY DO AS MUCH AS FRANCE, CHINA AND RUSSIA </p><p>TO HAVE SANCTIONS LIFTED.  NONETHELESS, TOIA REPORTEDLY TOLD </p><p>SHEBAB THAT SHE WELCOMED ADDITIONAL IRAQI DELEGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE GOI WOULD PROBABLY NOT OBJECT IF AGIP SIGNED AN </p><p>EXPLORATION OR PRODUCTION CONTRACT WITH IRAQ WHILE UNSC </p><p>SANCTIONS ARE IN PLACE, MFA OFFICIAL TRUPIANO TOLD ECOUNS JUNE </p><p>5, AS LONG AS THE CONTRACT DID NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE </p><p>SANCTIONS WERE LIFTED.  TRUPIANO NOTED THAT FRENCH PRODUCER </p><p>TOTAL HAD RECENTLY MADE JUST SUCH A DEAL WITH BAGHDAD.  (NOTE: </p><p>OFFICIALS FROM ENI, AGIP\'S PARENT, TOLD ECOUNS JUNE 6 THEY </p><p>WERE NOT AWARE THAT TOTAL HAD ACTUALLY SIGNED A DEAL WITH </p><p>IRAQ.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THESE IRAQI VISITS FOLLOW ON THE HEELS OF THE OPENING </p><p>OF AN ITALIAN INTERESTS SECTION IN BAGHDAD (REF H), AND THE </p><p>FEELING AMONG ITALIAN FIRMS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MISSING OUT ON </p><p>FUTURE BUSINESS DEALS IN IRAQ UNDER UNSCR 986.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>TRUPIANO, ITALY HAS RECEIVED ONLY FOUR CONTRACTS OUT OF 355 </p><p>APPROVED BY THE UNITED NATIONS UNDER UNSCR 986 -- ALL OF WHICH </p><p>WENT TO A SINGLE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY.  TRUPIANO INDICATED </p><p>THAT THIS SENSE OF UNFAIRNESS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO EXISTING </p><p>"SANCTIONS FATIGUE" IN ITALY.  THE GOI AND ITALIAN BUSINESS </p><p>SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE "GIANT" FRENCH INTEREST SECTION </p><p>IN BAGHDAD AND THE LARGE NUMBER OF 986 CONTRACTS WON BY FRENCH </p><p>FIRMS, TRUPIANO SAID; THE GOI ALSO CANNOT IGNORE THE REOPENING </p><p>OF THE SPANISH EMBASSY THERE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) PARLIAMENT HAS ALSO PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN </p><p>SHAPING GOI POLICY TOWARD IRAQ.  ON APRIL 15, THE SENATE </p><p>PASSED MOTIONS CALLING ON THE GOI TO UNDERTAKE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AND BILATERAL INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE LIVING CONDITIONS THERE </p><p>(REF K).  ON MAY 14, U/S TOIA MET WITH A GROUP OF SENATORS </p><p>FROM ACROSS POLITICAL LINES WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE GOI </p><p>WAS DOING IN RESPONSE TO THE MOTIONS.  A GROUP OF SEVEN AN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS VISITED IRAQ MAY 24 - 27, EVEN MEETING WITH </p><p>TARIQ AZIZ; LARGER PARLIAMENTARY AND BUSINESS DELEGATIONS ARE </p><p>SCHEDULED JUNE 22 -27, AND JULY 5 - 10 RESPECTIVELY.  "NEA" </p><p>ECONOMIC DEPUTY DIRECTOR FEDERICO FAILLA SAID THERE WAS STRONG </p><p>SENTIMENT AMONG THE POLITICAL LEFT AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN </p><p>FAVOR OF EASING IRAQI SUFFERING, ESPECIALLY AMONG CHILDREN. </p><p>HE COMMENTED THAT IT WOULD BE A "BIG" [DOMESTIC] POLITICAL </p><p>MISTAKE TO SHOW INSENSITIVITY TOWARD THIS SUFFERING.  "NEA" </p><p>POLITICAL DEPUTY BRASIOLI AGREED, CALLING THE ITALIAN URGE TO </p><p>ASSIST THE IRAQI PEOPLE AS BOTH "CULTURAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL." </p><p>HE NOTED THE "HUNDREDS OF LETTERS" THE MFA RECEIVES EACH MONTH </p><p>URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO DO SOMETHING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ITALY IS LIBYA\'S "FIRST PARTNER ECONOMICALLY" </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)   ITALY CONSIDERS ITSELF LIBYA\'S "FIRST PARTNER" </p><p>ECONOMICALLY AND IS THE WORLD\'S LARGEST EXPORTER TO THE </p><p>COUNTRY, ACCOUNTING FOR 21 PERCENT (USD 1.2 BILLION) OF ITS </p><p>TOTAL 1995 IMPORTS.  THE MFA\'S TRUPIANO SAYS ITALY WANTS TO </p><p>NARROW ITS USD 3 BILLION ANNUAL TRADE DEFICIT WITH LIBYA.  MFA </p><p>ECONOMIC DG DI ROBERTO AND "NEA" ECONOMIC DIRECTOR TRUPIANO </p><p>TRAVELLED TO TRIPOLI THE WEEK OF MAY 18-24.  THE NUMBER ONE </p><p>AGENDA ITEM WAS LIBYAN REPAYMENT OF CIRCA USD 1 BILLION IN </p><p>OUTSTANDING DEBT.  IN PREPARATION, ITALIAN AND LIBYAN </p><p>NEGOTIATORS MET MAY 15 TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION -- THE FIRST </p><p>TIME THE LIBYANS HAVE AGREED TO SUCH MEETINGS.  TRUPIANO TOLD </p><p>ECOUNS JUNE 5 THAT HE WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT A TECHNICAL MEETING </p><p>THE WEEK OF JUNE 9 COULD MAKE PROGRESS THAT MIGHT ALLOW THE </p><p>REPAYMENT OF ABOUT HALF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL "SOON."  DG </p><p>DI ROBERTO, HOWEVER, SAID HE WAS FAR LESS SANGUINE THAT ITALY </p><p>WOULD SEE REPAYMENTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) BEFORE LEAVING FOR TRIPOLI, TRUPIANO HAD TOLD EMBOFFS </p><p>THAT LIBYA CONTINUALLY ASKS ITALY TO EXPAND THE BILATERAL </p><p>COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP; ITALY REFUSES TO DO SO, HOWEVER, </p><p>UNTIL LIBYA MAKES GOOD ON ITS DEBT.  STILL, ITALY IS ANXIOUS </p><p>FOR LIBYA TO RE-JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- AND HAS </p><p>TOLD LIBYAN OFFICIALS THAT IT WILL HELP, IF LIBYA FIRST HELPS </p><p>ITSELF.  THE MFA FEELS THAT QADDHAFI HAS INDEED "CHANGED" AND </p><p>USES AS EVIDENCE HIS ATTENDANCE AT THE JUNE 1996 ARAB SUMMIT </p><p>IN CAIRO, HIS MORE "HUMANITARIAN" ATTITUDE TOWARD THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN COMMUNITY IN LIBYA AND HIS "COOPERATION" WITH </p><p>RECENT EGYPTIAN INSPECTION TEAMS AT TARHUNAH.  ITALIAN MFA </p><p>OFFICIALS CITE STEADY PRESSURE TO HELP GET THE SANCTIONS </p><p>LIFTED FROM MAGHREB STATES, ALL OF WHOM REPORTEDLY BELIEVE </p><p>QADDHAFI HAS TURNED A NEW LEAF. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  ITALY WILL NOT ALTER ITS DEPENDENCE ON LIBYAN OIL; </p><p>REPLACING IT WOULD BE COSTLY IN TERMS OF LOST INVESTMENTS, </p><p>HIGHER PETROLEUM PRICES, AND FUTURE TRADE TIES.  IN FACT, </p><p>ITALIAN DEPENDENCE ON LIBYAN ENERGY COULD INCREASE BY EARLY </p><p>NEXT CENTURY, WHEN LIBYA COULD SUPPLY EIGHT PERCENT OF ITALY\'S </p><p>NATURAL GAS.  STATE-OWNED AGIP -- THE LARGEST FOREIGN OIL </p><p>COMPANY IN LIBYA -- IS POISED TO BUILD A GAS PIPELINE BETWEEN </p><p>LIBYA AND SICILY WHICH MAY GO INTO OPERATION IN THE YEAR 2000. </p><p>CONSTRUCTION HAS NOT YET STARTED DUE, WE BELIEVE, TO AGIP AND </p><p>GOI UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE APPLICABILITY OF THE IRAN-LIBYA </p><p>SANCTIONS ACT, BUT ARE NOT SANGUINE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE </p><p>PUT OFF FOREVER. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) WITH LIBYA, AS WITH THE OTHER "ROGUES," WE CAN EXPECT </p><p>ITALY TO OBSERVE THE LETTER OF THE LAW WITH REGARD TO UNSC- </p><p>MANDATED SANCTIONS, BUT NOT GO AN INCH FURTHER.  ITALY CAN BE </p><p>EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO INTERPRET GRAY AREAS OF SANCTIONS </p><p>RESOLUTIONS IN LIBYA\'S FAVOR, AS IT DID WITH REGARD TO THE </p><p>INVESTMENT OF LIBYAN OIL REVENUES IN UNBLOCKED ITALIAN </p><p>ACCOUNTS (REF L). </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON ROGUES </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) THE ITALIANS KNOW THAT WE ARE IRRITATED BY THEIR CLOSE </p><p>TIES WITH THE "ROGUES," AND POLITELY DISAGREE WITH MANY OF OUR </p><p>POLICY PROPOSALS.  THE POWER OF THESE DISAGREEMENTS IS THAT </p><p>THEY ARISE FROM A DEEP BELIEF AND A PROFOUND NEED, ONE </p><p>PHILOSOPHICAL, THE OTHER COMMERCIAL. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) PHILOSOPHICALLY, THE ITALIANS, LIKE MANY OF THEIR </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS, BELIEVE THAT DIALOGUE, RATHER THAN </p><p>ISOLATION, IS THE KEY TO MODERATING THE BEHAVIOR OF PROBLEM </p><p>STATES.  THE GOI DOES HAVE A "ROGUE STATES" POLICY, AN MFA </p><p>CONTACT TOLD POLOFF RECENTLY, AND DINI SPELLED IT OUT IN THE </p><p>"ENERGY" ARTICLE (PARA 4).  COMMERCIALLY, ITALIANS HAVE REAL, </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS INTERESTS IN THESE COUNTRIES THAT WOULD </p><p>BE PUT AT RISK BY POLICIES MORE TO OUR LIKING.  ADOPTING A US- </p><p>STYLE POLICY OF ISOLATION WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE REPAYMENT OF AT </p><p>LEAST USD 5 BILLION IN OUTSTANDING DEBTS FROM IRAN AND LIBYA, </p><p>AND REQUIRE THE COUNTRY TO FIND A NEW SOURCE FOR NEARLY HALF </p><p>ITS PETROLEUM IMPORTS (REF P).  IN ADDITION, DESPITE A USD 60 </p><p>BILLION WORLDWIDE TRADE SURPLUS IN 1996, THE GOI CLEARLY FEELS </p><p>DRIVEN TO BRING MORE BALANCE TO TRADE ACCOUNTS WITH OIL- </p><p>EXPORTING COUNTRIES WHERE IT SEES LARGE DEFICITS.  IT THUS </p><p>WOULD NOT WANT TO TAKE ANY STEPS THAT MIGHT WORSEN THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT FOR INCREASING ITALIAN EXPORTS TO THESE STATES. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) THE ITALIANS INSIST THAT THEY ARE NOT "DOING </p><p>ANYTHING" TO VIOLATE COMMITMENTS MADE WITHIN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONTEXTS.  HOWEVER, IN THE WAKE OF EU FURY OVER ILSA AND </p><p>HELMS-BURTON, THEY HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY WILLING TO </p><p>CHARACTERIZE U.S. POLICIES OF ISOLATION AND IMPOSITION OF </p><p>SANCTIONS AS "IRRECONCILIABLE" AND MISGUIDED AND TO ARGUE </p><p>AGAINST SUCH WITHIN THE EU.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE GOI\'S </p><p>UNDISGUISED OPENNESS IN LOOKING FOR A COMPROMISE SOLUTION TO </p><p>THE "PAN AM PROBLEM," AND TO PROMOTING ALTERNATIVES, AS IT DID </p><p>AT THE RECENT WORKING GROUP MEETING IN BRUSSELS MAY 24, </p><p>EXPLAIN QADDHAFI\'S PERSISTENT USE OF ITALY AS LIBYA\'S </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IRAN HAS NEVER </p><p>GONE OFF THE GOI\'S RADAR, AND AS MFA OFFICIALS PUT IT "THE </p><p>GERMANS ARE JUST AS ANXIOUS TO GO BACK AS WE ARE!"  THE JUNE 2 </p><p>GENERAL AFFAIRS COUNCIL DECISION TO CONTINUE TO INDEFINITELY </p><p>POSTPONE THE RETURN OF EU AMBASSADORS WILL REQUIRE AL EU </p><p>PARTNERS TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER FOR THE BRIGHTER RELATIONSHIP </p><p>THEY ENVISION WITH NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT KHATAMI. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
