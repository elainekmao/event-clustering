<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BRASILIA 002500 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/BSC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BR, ECON, ELAB, PGOV, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: PENSION REFORM CLEARS HURDLE IN BRAZILIAN CHAMBER </p><p>OF DEPUTIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: BRASILIA 2407 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Early on 6 August the Chamber of Deputies </p><p>(the lower house of Brazil\'s congress) passed a </p><p>constitutional amendment bill that, if it ultimately becomes </p><p>law, would radically change Brazil\'s public sector pension </p><p>system. Key features of the measure are analyzed in reftel </p><p>and para 4 below. Passage of the proposal has become a test </p><p>of the Lula government\'s will and capacity to make </p><p>fundamental reforms in Brazil. Possible "destaques" </p><p>("observations") on the text -- some of them controversial -- </p><p>will be debated later in the plenary, but congressional </p><p>sources believe the government has the votes to defeat these </p><p>challenges, despite continuing protests by public sector </p><p>employees.  The final text will be put to an obligatory </p><p>second vote in the plenary later this month, and if again </p><p>supported, will move to the Brazilian Senate. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>The Process </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) To carry the measure, the government needed a </p><p>three-fifths majority (308 votes). The amendment bill passed </p><p>by a 358-126 vote margin, with nine abstentions.  About 100 </p><p>"destaques" ("observations" or "highlights") to the text were </p><p>proposed throughout August 5, but only 14 reportedly survived </p><p>for debate later (time not yet set) in the plenary.  These </p><p>"destaques" deal with controversial aspects of the amendment, </p><p>including contributions to the retirement system by </p><p>inactive/retired employees, and modifications to contribution </p><p>requirements for individuals with multiple income sources. </p><p>While these will be hotly debated, one congressional source </p><p>told poloffs the government coalition has sufficient votes to </p><p>defeat these challenges.  Large-scale demonstrations occurred </p><p>around the congress in Brasilia throughout the day on 6 </p><p>August, as different interest groups sought to put pressure </p><p>on legislators and the GOB. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Constitutional amendments require two plenary votes, </p><p>separated in time by at least five plenary sessions, but the </p><p>second vote normally serves to formalize the text (plus </p><p>agreed-to "highlights") approved in the first round of </p><p>voting.  A second and final vote could occur as early as next </p><p>week, or as late as the first week in September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Substance </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Reftel provides details of the bill voted this week. </p><p>Substantively, the bill\'s latest version incorporated GOB </p><p>concessions arising from negotiations with government allies. </p><p>The key change was GOB acceptance of a sub-ceiling for state </p><p>judiciary salaries (85.5 percent of federal salaries), </p><p>somewhat higher than what was originally offered (75 </p><p>percent).  The compromise came after Lula himself publicly </p><p>dug in his heels against the 90-plus percent demanded by the </p><p>state judges.  Other eleventh-hour adjustments were: (1) more </p><p>generous guidelines for survivor benefits; (2) a higher floor </p><p>for taxation of pensions, now to begin at 1,200 rather than </p><p>the 1,058 reals per month that had been proposed; (3) an 11 </p><p>percent pay premium for the 100,000-plus public sector </p><p>workers who already qualify for retirement under existing age </p><p>and time of service requirements (as an incentive for them </p><p>not to retire before they satisfy the bill\'s new minimum </p><p>limits). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment: Further pitfalls remain.  One </p><p>controversial point for debate, and a possible judicial </p><p>challenge later, will be the provision to begin taxing </p><p>pensions.  Former President Cardoso\'s effort along those </p><p>lines were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. </p><p>Pension reform is a vital necessity for Brazil\'s long-term </p><p>economic health, since the country cannot sustain the huge </p><p>fiscal deficits due in considerable measure to paying highly </p><p>generous benefits to retired civil servants.  In its eight </p><p>years in office, the Cardoso Administration was unable to </p><p>secure significant public sector pension change. The reform </p><p>measure passed Aug. 6 goes to the heart of long-standing </p><p>entitlements viewed as sacred by employees in Brazil\'s huge </p><p>public sector.   If a meaningful bill survives the political </p><p>and judicial challenges that still loom, the Lula government </p><p>will deserve major credit for demonstrating both the </p><p>political courage to take on this critical issue and the </p><p>skill to see it through. The jury is still out on that latter </p><p>quality.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Hrinak </p><p></p></div>
