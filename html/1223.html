VIETNAM\'S FIRST OFFICIAL STOCK MARKET, THE HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY SECURITIES TRADING CENTER (STC), OPENED JULY 20 WITH </p><p>GREAT FANFARE.  ALTHOUGH THE OPENING OF A SECURITIES MARKET, </p><p>ESPECIALLY SINCE IT CAME ON THE HEELS OF SIGNING THE </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, IS SIGNIFICANT AS A SYMBOL OF </p><p>CONTINUED ECONOMIC REFORM, ITS PRACTICAL IMPACT LIKELY WILL </p><p>BE NEGLIGIBLE IN THE SHORT-TERM.  ONLY FOUR COMPANIES WILL </p><p>BE LISTED INITIALLY, FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IS LIMITED, </p><p>FLUCTUATION MARGINS ARE TIGHTLY CONTROLLED, AND BALANCE </p><p>SHEETS OF LISTED COMPANIES WILL REMAIN OPAQUE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>STOCK MARKET OPENS </p><p>------------------ </p><p>2.  THE HO CHI MINH CITY SECURITIES TRADING CENTER (STC) </p><p>OPENED JULY 20 IN AN AS-YET UNREFURBISHED 85-YEAR-OLD </p><p>BUILDING LOCATED IN THE HEART OF THE CITY.  ACTING CONSUL </p><p>GENERAL JOHN ATTENDED THE OPENING, WHICH FEATURED A RIBBON- </p><p>CUTTING LED BY FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND PARTY ADVISOR VO </p><p>VAN KIET, AND AN OPENING SPEECH BY FIRST DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG. THE EVENT, WHICH ATTRACTED A LARGE </p><p>AUDIENCE OF LOCAL AND FOREIGN BUSINESSMEN, THE CONSULAR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01176  01 OF 02  212139Z </p><p>CORPS, AND INTERNATIONAL PRESS, TOOK PLACE AMIDST UNUSUALLY </p><p>TIGHT SECURITY, WITH SURROUNDING STREETS BLOCKED TO NORMAL </p><p>TRAFFIC. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DPM DUNG TOLD THE AUDIENCE THAT THE OPENING OF THE STC </p><p>DEMONSTRATED THE GVN\'S "FIRM DETERMINATION TO BUILD EVER </p><p>UNIFORM MARKET COMPONENTS OF THE ECONOMY."  THIS SENTIMENT </p><p>WAS ECHOED IN THE INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS BY NGUYEN DUC QUANG, </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION, WHO NOTED THAT </p><p>THE CREATION OF THE STC WAS THE NATURAL NEXT STEP IN </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR VIETNAM.  QUANG CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE TWO YEARS PREPARATORY PERIOD FOR THE OPENING WAS </p><p>INADEQUATE FOR SUCH A LARGE TASK, BUT THAT THE LIMITED </p><p>OPENING WAS "AN IMPORTANT REHEARSAL FOR A MODERN AND </p><p>DEVELOPED STOCK MARKET IN THE FUTURE." </p><p> </p><p>NUMEROUS CONSTRAINTS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>4.  AS REPORTED IN REFTEL, THE MARKET WILL OPERATE UNDER </p><p>NUMEROUS TRADING CONSTRAINTS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THAT </p><p>ONLY FOUR COMPANIES WILL BE LISTED INITIALLY.  PRICES WILL </p><p>NOT BE PERMITTED TO FLUCTUATE MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT DAILY, </p><p>AND STRINGENT CAPS WILL BE SET ON FOREIGN OWNERSHIP. </p><p>MOREOVER, THESE CAPS DICTATE THAT IT WILL BE VIRTUALLY </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE MANDATED SINGLE PRICE ON SHARES, </p><p>SINCE THEY CREATE A VIRTUAL SECOND MARKET FOR FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTORS. </p><p> </p><p>OPINIONS OF FOREIGN BANKERS MIXED </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>5.  A SEASONED AMERICAN BANKER TOLD ACG ON THE EVE OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01176  01 OF 02  212139Z </p><p>OPENING THAT THE STOCK MARKET "WAS A JOKE."  THIS OBSERVER </p><p>FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON THE PROBLEMS CITED ABOVE, BUT ALSO ON </p><p>THE OPAQUE NATURE OF VIETNAMESE BOOKKEEPING STANDARDS. </p><p>UNTIL TRANSPARENCY IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, FOREIGN INVESTORS </p><p>WOULD LIKELY IGNORE THE STC.  HOWEVER, ANOTHER AMERICAN </p><p>MERCHANT BANKER (WHO WAS DISTRIBUTING FLYERS FOR HIS </p><p>MERCHANT BANK AT THE OPENING CEREMONY) TOLD ACG THAT THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR THE MARKET 24 MONTHS OUT WAS SIGNIFICANT.  HE </p><p>PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD BE 150 TO 200 COMPANIES LISTED BY </p><p>THAT TIME, AND THAT INDUSTRY AND SECTORAL FUNDS, SUCH AS </p><p>HIS, WOULD BE REWARDING FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: A POSITIVE START; SUBSTANCE TO FOLLOW? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>6.  COMING ON THE HEELS OF THE SIGNING OF THE BTA, THE </p><p>OPENING OF THE STOCK MARKET ATTRACTED SIGNIFICANT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESS ATTENTION THAT CENTERED ON VIETNAM\'S </p><p>TRANSFORMING ECONOMY.  ALTHOUGH THE OPENING OF THE MARKET IS </p><p>SYMBOLICALLY SIGNIFICANT, REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND </p><p>CORPORATE PRACTICES INDICATE THAT THE MARKET WILL HAVE </p><p>MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE VIETNAMESE ECONOMY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p>VIETNAM WILL HAVE TO WORK HARD ON SUPERVISING THE NEW </p><p>MARKET.  IF THE NEW MARKET CAN CAPTURE SOME OF THE INFORMAL </p><p>TRADING ACTIVITY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKING PLACE, ALL THE </p><p>BETTER.  THAT HO CHI MINH CITY IS THE VENUE FOR VIETNAM\'S </p><p>FIRST STOCK MARKET IS ALSO GOOD.  DESPITE THE PERSISTENT </p><p>BACKWARDNESS OF ECONOMIC THEORY IN THE NORTH, HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY\'S ECONOMY IS `DE FACTO\' TAKING ON MANY OF THE </p><p>CHARACTERISTICS OF MARKET ORIENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>JOHN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
