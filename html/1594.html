IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) THE MARCH 18 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE (GOZ)-CONTROLLED "THE SUNDAY MAIL" RAN A FRONT- </p><p>PAGE STORY STATING THAT THE JUST-ELECTED LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE CONFEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS (ZCTU), </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENT UMBRELLA LABOR ORGANIZATION, WAS </p><p>BEING PRESSURED TO HOLD NEW ELECTIONS BECAUSE OF </p><p>IRREGULARITIES AT ITS FEBRUARY 23-24 FIVE-YEAR CONGRESS. </p><p>NO OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE REPORTED ON THIS </p><p>ALLEGED DEVELOPMENT.  THE ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES ARE NOT </p><p>RELATED TO THE ELECTION OF THE NEW ZCTU NATIONAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  RATHER, THE IRREGULARITIES ARE THAT THE </p><p>JUST-COMPLETED CONGRESS FAILED TO CONFIRM OR REJECT </p><p>AMENDMENTS AND CORRECTIONS MADE TO THE ZCTU CONSTITUTION </p><p>AT THE 1995 CONGRESS.  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE, 15 OF </p><p>THE 32 UNIONS AFFILIATED TO THE ZCTU ARE NOW CLAIMING </p><p>THAT THE ELECTIONS OF THE NEW LEADERSHIP ARE NULLIFIED, </p><p>AND DEMANDING THAT NEW ELECTIONS BE HELD. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) LABOFF, THOUGH UNABLE TO REACH ANYONE AT THE </p><p>ZCTU, DID TALK WITH GEBRE GEBREMARIAM (PROTECT), THE </p><p>AMCIT REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AFL-CIO SOLIDARITY </p><p>CENTER IN HARARE, WHO MAINTAINS CLOSE TIES WITH THE ZCTU </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  GEBREMARIAM STATED THAT THE ARTICLE WAS, TO </p><p>THE BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE, GOZ PROPAGANDA AIMED AT </p><p>DISCREDITING THE NEW ZCTU EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP (WHOSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01054  191807Z </p><p>MEMBERS ALL SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE).  HE OPINED THAT THE ALLEGED </p><p>IRREGULARITIES MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE, EVEN IF TRUE, </p><p>WOULD NOT NECESSITATE THE HOLDING OF NEW ELECTIONS FOR </p><p>THE ZCTU LEADERSHIP.  HE WAS ALSO VERY SKEPTICAL THAT 15 </p><p>OF THE 32 AFFILIATED UNIONS DESIRED THAT NEW ELECTIONS </p><p>BE HELD. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: "THE SUNDAY MAIL" ARTICLE DEFINITELY </p><p>SMACKS OF A GOZ/ZANU-PF PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT </p><p>THE NEW ZCTU LEADERSHIP.  THE ZCTU IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE POLITICS, AND COULD HOLD A VERY INFLUENTIAL, IF </p><p>NOT DECISIVE, ROLE IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THE GOZ/ZANU-PF ARE STILL FUMING THAT, </p><p>HAVING FUNDED THE PAYMENT OF BACK-DUES OF UNIONS TO THE </p><p>ZCTU AND, ALLEGEDLY, BRIBING INDIVIDUAL UNION DELEGATES </p><p>IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE ZCTU ELECTIONS, NOT ONE PRO- </p><p>ZANU-PF CANDIDATE WAS ELECTED TO THE ZCTU LEADERSHIP. </p><p>THEY WOULD DEARLY LOVE TO HAVE ANOTHER SHOT AT GAINING </p><p>CONTROL OF THE ZCTU, AND THE HOLDING OF NEW ELECTIONS </p><p>FOR THE ZCTU LEADERSHIP WOULD PRESENT THIS OPPORTUNITY. </p><p>WHILE "THE SUNDAY MAIL" ARTICLE IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT </p><p>FORCING NEW ELECTIONS, WE STRONGLY DOUBT IT WILL BE THE </p><p>LAST.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
