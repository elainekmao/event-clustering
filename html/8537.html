HARARE 1149 </p><p>     B. HARARE 1136 </p><p>     C. HARARE 1122 </p><p>     D. HARARE 1101 </p><p>     E. HARARE 1097 </p><p>     F. HARARE 1081 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Due to an overwhelming youth militia presence in </p><p>downtown Harare on June 6, the MDC planned to call off </p><p>planned marches for Harare.  Business and traffic activity </p><p>seemed close to normal on June 6, albeit slightly reduced </p><p>from the previous day.  In calling for a march, and then not </p><p>making any visible appearance, we cannot help but wonder </p><p>whether the MDC has lost further political capital today. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>No Marches Anticipated in Harare </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In driving around Harare on the morning of June 6, </p><p>Poloffs counted at least 200 youth militia members wearing </p><p>white t-shirts on which were imprinted "No to Mass Action". </p><p>Also visible were numerous groups of 3 - 4 police officers. </p><p>According to a Canadian diplomat walking through Africa Unity </p><p>Square later, at least 500 youth militia members had </p><p>converged at Africa Unity Square in the center of Harare, the </p><p>proposed destinations of the main MDC march in Harare.  The </p><p>diplomat said about 100 police officers, some armed, were </p><p>surrounding the Square.  According to an organizer, this </p><p>pro-government group planned to hold a rally with speeches in </p><p>the Square shortly.  Job Sikhala, MP for St. Mary\'s (a </p><p>high-density suburb of Harare) said that soldiers in military </p><p>vehicles had been deployed in St. Mary\'s for the past two </p><p>days.  He said, due to their presence, the likelihood of MDC </p><p>members marching in the streets was nil. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Gandi Mudzingwa, MDC Presidential </p><p>Advisor, due to the overwhelming presence of youth militia </p><p>members in downtown Harare, (he estimated the number to be </p><p>2000) the MDC would call off marches for June 6 in Harare. </p><p>He said up to 3000 MDC members were standing in bank or </p><p>transport queues in downtown Harare waiting for the call to </p><p>march, but instead would receive a stand down order as any </p><p>attempt to march would certainly lead to violent clashes with </p><p>the militia members.  He considered their effort nonetheless </p><p>a success for having elicited a major youth militia response </p><p>from the GOZ.  Mudzingwa said they had not yet made decisions </p><p>on whether to go ahead with marches in other cities around </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>Stayaway Better than June 5 </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Driving around Harare on June 6, Poloffs observed </p><p>about 20 percent of shops in downtown Harare, and 90 percent </p><p>of businesses in the light industrial areas of Harare were </p><p>closed.  Pedestrian and vehicle traffic in downtown Harare </p><p>seemed normal.  Activity in the high-density suburb of Mbare </p><p>seemed normal. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) According to Richard Pope, a furniture manufacturer in </p><p>Bulawayo, about 22 percent of his workers did not show up on </p><p>June 6.  He said many other factories nearby were open and </p><p>operating, most with an average of 75 percent of their normal </p><p>workforces.  He said business and street traffic around </p><p>Bulawayo seemed almost normal. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In driving around Harare Poloff\'s did not observe </p><p>anyone who appeared to be gathering for a march.  In calling </p><p>for a march, and then not making any visible appearance, we </p><p>cannot help but wonder whether the MDC has lost further </p><p>political capital.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
