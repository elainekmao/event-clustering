<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 007739 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ELECTION INTERFERENCE FEARS IN COUNTRYSIDE </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) SUMMARY: While political leaders acknowledge </p><p>that the restrictions in expression in Turkey\'s </p><p>Southeast have generally loosened, villagers remain </p><p>concerned that their voices will not be heard in </p><p>Ankara. Based on conversations with politicians, </p><p>business leaders, and NGO representatives, several </p><p>social divides appear to strongly influence the outcome </p><p>of the upcoming vote in Southeast Turkey.  Urban-rural </p><p>differences couple with ethnic divides, most likely </p><p>resulting in DEHAP and AK being the big regional </p><p>winners.  Interference by local jandarma and village </p><p>guards, as well as the effect of the baraj, could </p><p>significantly influence the region\'s parliamentary </p><p>representation.  However, human rights organizations </p><p>and DEHAP officials report significantly less </p><p>interference in pro-Kurdish political expression </p><p>compared to elections in 1995 and 1999.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>WILL DEHAP SWEEP THE SOUTHEAST? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) Though no reliable figures exist for ethnic </p><p>population statistics, estimates suggest approximately </p><p>15 million Turkish citizens of Kurdish descent living </p><p>in Turkey\'s Southeast.  A large number of these Kurds </p><p>plan to vote for DEHAP (Democratic People\'s Party), the </p><p>successor party to HADEP.  In an October 15 decision, </p><p>DEHAP got a green light for participation in the </p><p>upcoming elections.  Election preparations continue </p><p>apace.  Many small villages in the region boast only </p><p>one party office, DEHAP\'s.  In larger towns and cities </p><p>throughout the Southeast, DEHAP leaders believe they </p><p>are poised to take a considerable portion of the vote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) Several obstacles exist to DEHAP entering </p><p>parliament.  First, and most significant for Turkish </p><p>political development, DEHAP is being intentionally </p><p>hampered, often by jandarma and village guards.  These </p><p>allegations come from Diyarbakir and Mardin human </p><p>rights advocates, as well as DEHAP leaders throughout </p><p>the Southeast.  DEHAP members are regularly harassed by </p><p>jandarma and security officials, including verbal </p><p>threats, arbitrary arrest at rallies, and detention at </p><p>checkpoints (in one case, a group of DEHAP leaders from </p><p>Diyarbakir was detained for seven hours at a checkpoint </p><p>in Sirnak without any explanation, according to DEHAP </p><p>Sirnak Chairman Resul Sadak). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Security forces also regularly harass </p><p>villagers they believe are sympathetic to DEHAP. </p><p>Mazlum-Der, Human Rights Association (HRA) and DEHAP </p><p>officials throughout the region report cases of </p><p>jandarma and village guards threatening villagers not </p><p>to vote for DEHAP.  The villagers are warned that, </p><p>should DEHAP win the vote from that area, the town may </p><p>be burned, re-evacuated, or denied services (such as </p><p>electricity or water).  Diyarbakir\'s HRA also reports </p><p>one case in which a village was told by jandarma, if </p><p>they really wanted to show their support for DEHAP, </p><p>that was fine, but only one person, the village sheikh, </p><p>should vote symbolically on behalf of the whole </p><p>village.  Of course, in reality, the vote would only </p><p>count for one vote, not hundreds.  Ultimately, DEHAP is </p><p>most concerned that these same security officials will </p><p>be ensuring the sanctity of the ballot box.  DEHAP </p><p>fully expects vote tampering to take place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>AK IS AN URBAN PHENOMENON </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) AK is, by all current estimations, leading the </p><p>polls throughout Turkey.  In the Southeast, this </p><p>popularity, while significant, is largely confined to </p><p>larger urban centers.  Only in Diyarbakir and Gaziantep </p><p>does AK currently expect to lead the pack, with DEHAP </p><p>also getting a strong showing.  In smaller cities such </p><p>as Mardin (where DEHAP and ANAP seem, currently, to be </p><p>running first and second) and Hakkari, AK barely shows </p><p>up on the radar.  In fact, though socially very </p><p>conservative, leaders throughout the region seem vastly </p><p>more concerned with security and ethnic issues rather </p><p>than the possible impact of an Islamically-minded </p><p>party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE BARAJ IS CRUCIAL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) What does this mean for a future Turkish </p><p>parliament?  If DEHAP takes ten percent of the national </p><p>vote, the number of parliament seats per party will </p><p>come close to the Southeast popular vote.  If, however, </p><p>DEHAP does not make the cutoff, huge sections of the </p><p>region will be unrepresented.  Diyarbakir\'s AK Parti </p><p>leader, Nezir Koclardan, admits as much.  Though he </p><p>believes AK will take only 30 percent of the popular </p><p>vote, he expects this to yield seven of Diyarbakir\'s </p><p>ten seats, betting that DEHAP, though beating them </p><p>locally, will not cross the national threshold.  In </p><p>Sirnak, where DEHAP believes it can muster 70 percent </p><p>of the total vote, ANAP could benefit enormously. </p><p>ANAP, which has historically had strong backing in </p><p>Sirnak, could reap windfall parliamentary seats should </p><p>DEHAP not clear the baraj.  If neither party crosses </p><p>the baraj, however, a small fraction of the popular </p><p>vote (as little as 15 percent) could take all the </p><p>province\'s seats. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Despite a seemingly endless list of </p><p>grievances, Kurdish leaders freely admit that the </p><p>situation in the region is more accepting of DEHAP </p><p>(previously HADEP) than at any time in the past. </p><p>Registering the party and its candidates is done freely </p><p>throughout the region.  Party headquarters are opened </p><p>with minimal interference.  Rallies often are given </p><p>permission by the local governor.  However, local </p><p>security officials, acting on their own authority, </p><p>frequently seek to dampen enthusiasm for DEHAP. </p><p>Crossing the critical ten percent baraj will be a tight </p><p>squeeze for DEHAP, but would result in a very different </p><p>TBMM.  In such a tight contest, piecemeal interference </p><p>by local officials could thus have significant national </p><p>impact.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Holtz </p><p></p></div>
