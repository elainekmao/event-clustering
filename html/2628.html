<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000852 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: A SNAPSHOT OF OBASANJO\'S ELECTORAL PROSPECTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 829 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Three years ago, Obasanjo rode into office </p><p>on a wave of optimism: Gone was the military; democratic rule </p><p>had returned. Now, with a year until the elections, </p><p>Obasanjo\'s prospects are uncertain.  His abrupt manner, </p><p>callous public remarks, and unwillingness to listen have </p><p>alienated key opinion-makers and former supporters.  If </p><p>elections were today, he might lose regions and votes won in </p><p>1999 and could well lose the entire contest if faced with </p><p>credible opposition. In fact, the PDP nomination is not a </p><p>sure bet, as House Speaker Ghali Na\'Abba and others are </p><p>fomenting rebellion within the party to spoil Obasanjo\'s bid. </p><p> On the positive side for Obasanjo, the power of incumbency </p><p>is very formidable in Nigeria. Also, Obasanjo probably can </p><p>count on support in the Northeast as long as Vice President </p><p>Atiku remains on the ticket and might be able to finesse the </p><p>Southwest if he can reach a modus vivendi with Alliance for </p><p>Democracy (AD) Governors and moderates within the most </p><p>influential Yoruba organization, Afenifere.  Ultimately, one </p><p>of his biggest electoral asset may be a negative one -- the </p><p>lack of an alternative around whom his various opponents can </p><p>easily rally.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>WHERE ARE ALL MY FRIENDS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In 1999, President Obasanjo won a landslide victory, </p><p>with widespread support in the North and Southeast. Obasanjo </p><p>could not replicate that feat today, and he need not look </p><p>beyond the closest mirror to identify the main cause of his </p><p>diminished prospects. He came to office because others lent </p><p>their power bases and constituencies.  However, as with any </p><p>loan, there was interest to be paid. Obasanjo owed his </p><p>powerful supporters access and the legitimate political </p><p>fruits that come with backing a winner in any democratic </p><p>system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Instead, Obasanjo increasingly has been a one-man </p><p>show. To many Nigerian political figures, Obasanjo is an </p><p>arrogant know-it-all who eschews dialogue, siphons </p><p>independent minds from the Administration and upbraids those </p><p>bold enough to express different points of view.  When a </p><p>situation beckons suasion or cajolery, Obasanjo wields either </p><p>mace or mallet.  He behaves like a general in civilian </p><p>President\'s clothing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A born again Christian, Obasanjo also has a </p><p>self-righteous, almost messianic streak.  Part of him </p><p>believes he has been divinely anointed; thus, he need not </p><p>listen to the counsel of most mortals, especially given that </p><p>he has steered the Nigerian ship of State before.  Since he </p><p>gives no ear to the counsel of others, they are unforgiving </p><p>in their evaluation of his performance.  Unfortunately, the </p><p>Government\'s performance has earned it and him many demerits; </p><p>because he mostly has gone it alone, he must shoulder the </p><p>blame alone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>The Election Map Does Not Lie </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) If hired by Obasanjo, a conscientious campaign </p><p>manager would suffer an acute migraine gazing at the </p><p>electoral map.  Regions and groups Obasanjo carried by wide </p><p>margins in 1999 are tilting against him in the run-up to </p><p>2003.  Regaining positive balance in these areas will take </p><p>guile, money and luck. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A) Where He is Weak: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Northwest: This is the political heart of the North.  No </p><p>one has become Head of State without the support or </p><p>acquiescence of this region.  Here, unfortunately, Obasanjo </p><p>has lost the most ground.  He has alienated key figures like </p><p>former Heads of State Babangida, Abubakar, and Buhari.  The </p><p>revered Emir of Kano has publicly criticized Obasanjo\'s </p><p>performance.  The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), the </p><p>region\'s preeminent association of luminaries, is a house </p><p>divided regarding Obasanjo.  However, the anti-Obasanjo camp </p><p>is more numerous, vocal and active.  The powerful Arewa elite </p><p>still bristles over his removal of senior Northern officers </p><p>from the military.  They also complain that his government is </p><p>corrupt, his economic mismanagement has decimated </p><p>agriculture, the paramount sector in that region, and that he </p><p>has given too many key positions to fellow Yorubas at the </p><p>expense of Northern interests (when the Southwest arrayed </p><p>against him in 1999).  Last, a PDP gadfly, former Kano </p><p>Governor Abubakar Rimi is contesting for the Party\'s </p><p>nomination.  While Rimi has a snowball\'s chance of winning, </p><p>Obasanjo may further offend Northerners if he mishandles </p><p>Rimi\'s challenge by attacking him too heavily since no one </p><p>likes to see a family member publicly upbraided by an </p><p>outsider. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Southeast:  This area voted overwhelmingly for Obasanjo in </p><p>1999.  Two reasons for Obasanjo\'s reversal of fortune are the </p><p>Administration\'s insensitivity to Igbo political aspirations </p><p>and perceived federal inattention to economic development in </p><p>the densely populated region.  In addition to his politically </p><p>costly, yet unnecessary, war of words with popular Abia State </p><p>Governor Orji Kalu, Obasanjo has criticized </p><p>Igbo-organizations (Ohaneze Ndigbo, for example) for </p><p>undermining security and national unity.  Other </p><p>Administration officials have been more acrid, labeling </p><p>soldiers who fought on the Biafran side of the civil war </p><p>"traitors" and deriding calls for an Igbo President as </p><p>foolish. (These calls are indirect attacks against the Yoruba </p><p>Obasanjo seeking a second term. Discarding the Obasanjo-Atiku </p><p>ticket, opens the door to an Igbo as number one or two on the </p><p>presidential ticket.) These statements by government </p><p>officials cut deep into Igbo sensitivities, giving substance </p><p>to Igbo grievances that they have not been reintegrated into </p><p>the national political system as full partners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Middle Belt: The western Middle Belt, e. g. Niger and </p><p>Kwara, is tied to the Northwest. Obasanjo suffers the same </p><p>afflictions there as in the Northern heartland.  In the </p><p>Eastern Middle Belt, he is in hot water with the Tivs, the </p><p>Middle Belt\'s most populous and politically agile group. </p><p>Tivs are bitter over the October 2001 massacre of Tiv </p><p>villagers by federal government troops. They also suspect the </p><p>Government of siding with their ethnic rivals, the Jukun, </p><p>because Defence Minister Danjuma, a close Obasanjo ally, is </p><p>Jukun. However, to Obasanjo\'s benefit,fundamentalist </p><p>Christians (whether Tiv or of another ethnicity) are numerous </p><p>in this area, and many would tend to vote Obasanjo over most </p><p>Muslim alternatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Finding Some Support: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Southwest:  Obasanjo lost here in 1999; taking it this </p><p>time will require walking a delicate tightrope, something </p><p>Obasanjo does not do particularly well.  Slain Justice </p><p>Minister Bola Ige, a stalwart of Yoruba politics, was making </p><p>inroads toward rehabilitating Obasanjo in this region despite </p><p>belonging to an opposition party (the AD). However, as Ige\'s </p><p>assassination shows, the Southwest is not monolithic, and </p><p>Yoruba politics can be fractious, even dangerous.  Yet, many </p><p>Yorubas are willing to support Obasanjo out of ethnic unity; </p><p>they realize the President in 2003 either will be Obasanjo or </p><p>a non-Yoruba.  However, Obasanjo\'s desire to control the </p><p>Southwest through the PDP fouls majority Yoruba sentiment. </p><p>It is a case of right ethnic group, wrong party.  His best </p><p>bet for winning the region is to cut an "incumbents deal" </p><p>with AD Governors: in such a deal, he would promise not to </p><p>actively support their PDP opponents; in exchange the </p><p>Governors would tacitly endorse, at least not actively </p><p>oppose, him in their states.  However, if he continues to </p><p>press for PDP primacy in these states, support based on </p><p>ethnic solidarity will yield to each AD governor\'s individual </p><p>interests in his political self-preservation.  Initial signs </p><p>are not positive.  One of Obasanjo\'s Special Advisers is </p><p>running for Governor of Ogun, and there is no sign that he </p><p>objects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Northeast: Primarily because of Vice President Atiku, who </p><p>hails from Adamawa, the ticket should do well in the </p><p>Northeast.  Yet, Atiku\'s loyalty may be frangible.  Many </p><p>believe Atiku is double-dealing and would gladly pull the rug </p><p>from under Obasanjo if that would give Atiku the party\'s </p><p>nomination.  In any event, the Northeast is not as pivotal as </p><p>the Northwest or Southeast,  and Atiku still is in trouble </p><p>with many Northern leaders over his waffling over the </p><p>introduction of criminal Sharia in the North. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. A Toss-Up </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- South/South: This area is tougher than the others to read </p><p>because there is no one dominant group.  Obasanjo has some </p><p>powerful detractors here but also has wheeler-dealer Works </p><p>Minister Tony Anenih, an unabashed political operator who </p><p>apparently believes that, no matter how bad things are, </p><p>elections can be bought.  While he may not be viewed with </p><p>much respect elsewhere, Anenih has sway here.  Much will </p><p>depend on the deals Anenih can work with state governors and </p><p>other political leaders.  Because most oil facilities are </p><p>here, revenue and resource allocation questions between the </p><p>federal and state governments will loom large in the lead-up </p><p>to elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ENEMIES TO THE NORTH OF HIM </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) After Obasanjo, former Head of State Babangida is the </p><p>most discussed political figure in Nigeria.  Because IBB </p><p>helped bankroll the President in 1999 and because he is one </p><p>of few Nigerians who casts a nationwide shadow, the </p><p>withdrawal of his support is a major blow.  Obasanjo will be </p><p>hurt more if reports of Babangida\'s active opposition prove </p><p>true.  A close associate of both Babangida and VP Atiku, </p><p>recently informed us that OO and IBB had a very stormy </p><p>telephone conversation in January after the President accused </p><p>Babangida of fueling National Assembly opposition to him. </p><p>The two hung up on each other.  Reportedly, Obasanjo later </p><p>tried to make amends but Babangida has resisted detente. </p><p>Babangida is said to have responded with cold silence when </p><p>Atiku asked if he would back Obasanjo-Atiku in 2003.  Several </p><p> IBB-for-President campaigns are underway. while the Man from </p><p>Minna does not acknowledge any of them,  it is widely </p><p>believed he funds them, if for no other reason than to keep </p><p>the political pot bubbling.  Babangida reportedly is also </p><p>funds two unregistered political parties, the UNDP and NDP, </p><p>both of which have support in the North and Southeast.  The </p><p>Southeast is a region where Babangida has assiduously </p><p>cultivated support.  Abacha-era Minister, former Senator from </p><p>Akwa Ibom and current UNDP stalwart Don Etiebet said in early </p><p>March that the party\'s Presidential nomination awaited </p><p>Babangida if he wanted it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Other Northern interests, including the ACF, are </p><p>sending out feelers to other areas of the country; their </p><p>liaison with groups in other regions, particularly the </p><p>Southeast, spells trouble for Obasanjo.  ACF leaders have </p><p>journeyed to the Southeast several times, ostensibly to </p><p>discuss ethno-religious violence.  The ACF has inserted </p><p>itself as a mediator in the Tiv-Jukun feud in the eastern </p><p>Middle Belt.  In both cases, talks may have veered toward </p><p>politics and toward channeling local disgruntlement with </p><p>Obasanjo into real political opposition.  In early March, it </p><p>was announced that Northern and Southeastern leaders would </p><p>meet in Abia State to discuss national unity and internal </p><p>violence.  Curiously, leaders from the Southwest were not </p><p>invited to this session hosted by Obasanjo antagonist, Abia </p><p>Governor Orji Kalu, who also  has links to Banbangida.  This </p><p>line-up suggests that conference organizers may be exploring </p><p>the potent North-Southeast axis that has decided previous </p><p>Presidential elections while keeping Yoruba-centric </p><p>candidates, e.g. Awolowo, from realizing their aspirations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Enemies from Within </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Obasanjo faces a growing rebellion within the PDP led </p><p>by House Speaker Na\'Abba.  Personal animosity dates back to </p><p>2000 when the Presidency unsuccessfully tried to dump Na\'Abba </p><p>as Speaker.  Since the electoral controversy erupted last </p><p>December, Na\'Abba has challenged Obasanjo on a variety of </p><p>issue from fuel price hikes, the January police strike, </p><p>disclosure of Assembly Members salaries, to the federal </p><p>budget.  Na\'Abba orchestrated a public debate in the House </p><p>which blamed Obasanjo for Nigeria\'s woes and labeled his </p><p>leadership inept.  That debate has the markings of the </p><p>opening salvo of a concerted effort to keep Obasanjo from the </p><p>party\'s nomination. Since then Na\'Abba not only has </p><p>pinpricked Obasanjo whenever he can on substantive issues </p><p>like the budget and the threatened police strike, but the </p><p>Speaker has been at the forefront of efforts to unite party </p><p>dissidents in order to make a public statement against </p><p>Obasanjo\'s candidacy.  Perhaps even more troubling for </p><p>Obasanjo, PDP Chairman Audu Ogbeh appears to be listening to </p><p>the malcontents.  Recently, Ogbeh felt compelled to state </p><p>publicly that no candidate is preordained, and that he would </p><p>not allow any party nomination to be orchestrated in </p><p>frustration of the majority\'s will.  (Having helped  Ogbeh to </p><p>the Chairmanship less than six months ago, Obasanjo cannot </p><p>readily dump him now.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>DON\'T COUNT HIM OUT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) .  Given a few months of relative peace without major </p><p>communal violence, if the economy does not dip, and if he </p><p>learns to listen and accept a little help from his friends, </p><p>Obasanjo\'s popularity perhaps can bounce back.  Additionally, </p><p>the aura of incumbency is very strong in Nigeria.  While </p><p>everyone  may  grumble, the benefits that accrue from being </p><p>on the right side of that power and the hardships of being on </p><p>the wrong side will keep many people from breaking formation. </p><p> Last, some Obasanjo opponents hate each other as much as </p><p>they dislike the President.  While agreeing Obasanjo should </p><p>walk the plank, they will have a tough time agreeing who </p><p>should take his place.  The Obasanjo camp will try to exploit </p><p>these cleavages to keep the opposition from coalescing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Obasanjo is in deep trouble.  His popularity has </p><p>declined and he is estranged from much of the political </p><p>class, particularly in the all-important North.  Opponents </p><p>know that Obasanjo rode the bank accounts and goodwill of </p><p>others into office.  With many of his former backers now </p><p>angered by his brusque manner and unremarkable job </p><p>performance, these opponents feel Obasanjo is very vulnerable </p><p>as they do not believe he has a loyal political machine or </p><p>constituency to call his own.  However, by virtue of his very </p><p>office, Obasanjo has a political machine -- the federal </p><p>government.  If used prudently, this is the most powerful, </p><p>influential machine in the nation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Comment Continued.  For Obasanjo to bounce back  will </p><p>require a level-headed strategy.  The outlines of that </p><p>strategy  must include an attempt to regain some support in </p><p>the North and Southeast by making amends with members of the </p><p>political elites in both regions who have not completely </p><p>written him off.  Additionally, he will have to avoid </p><p>fighting with AD Governors and Afenifere in the Southwest. </p><p>Obasanjo should also try to douse the ardor of his strong </p><p>adversaries by breaking bread with some key figures that </p><p>oppose him.  Last, and more importantly, he must govern </p><p>better.  This means a lot less international junketing and a </p><p>stronger focus on two key domestic issues -- internal </p><p>insecurity/communal violence and the struggling economy, </p><p>particularly the near-moribund agricultural and manufacturing </p><p>sectors. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
