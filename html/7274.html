<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 001728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR TO HR/OE DOUG FRANK; NEA/SA/EX BILL </p><p>HUDSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: APER, AFIN, AMGT </p><p>SUBJECT: URGENT NEED FOR FSN HEALTH INSURANCE, UAE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE LEVEL OF HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE UAE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS (WHO COMPRISE 100 </p><p>PERCENT OF OUR FSN STAFF) HAS DIMINISHED SO RAPIDLY IN </p><p>THE PAST MONTHS THAT THE NEED FOR A HEALTH INSURANCE </p><p>PROGRAM FOR OUR STAFF HAS NOW BECOME URGENT. </p><p> </p><p>CALLS TO THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) REVEAL THAT NOT </p><p>EVEN THE MINISTER\'S PERSONAL AIDE CAN EXPLAIN EXACTLY </p><p>WHAT BENEFITS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE HEALTH CARD. </p><p>ONE EMPLOYEE IS CHARGED AED 20 FOR TWO INOCULATIONS AND </p><p>A CONSULTATION.  ANOTHER IS CHARGED AED 200 TO SET A </p><p>BROKEN ARM.  ANOTHER IS CHARGED FULL COST FOR AN MRI AND </p><p>A CAT SCAN (RUNNING INTO THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS). </p><p>LINES AT THE ONLY HOSPITALS APPROVED FOR USE WITH THE </p><p>CARD ARE NOTORIOUS; THE WAIT IS USUALLY SEVERAL HOURS. </p><p>EMPLOYEES WAIT TWO MONTHS FOR ROUTINE EXAMINATIONS AND </p><p>NOT-SO-ROUTINE CHECKS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME FOR EXPATRIATES </p><p>IS IN CHAOS.  WE SEE PRESS PIECES THAT THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>LABOR PLANS TO IMPLEMENT MANDATORY PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR </p><p>ALL EXPATRIATES BY MAKING ISSUANCE OF A LABOR PERMIT </p><p>CONTINGENT ON PROOF OF SUCH.  BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT RAPID </p><p>PROGRESS, BECAUSE OF  THE POLITICAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF </p><p>IMPOSING PRIVATE INSURANCE ON ALL COMPANIES.  THE VAST </p><p>MAJORITY OF THE UAE LABOR FORCE IS EXPATRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>THE ONLY CLEAR TREND IS THE RAPID UNDERMINING OF THE </p><p>BENEFITS OFFERED BY THE UAE GOVERNMENT.  POST EXPECTS TO </p><p>SUBMIT THE UPDATED INSURANCE COMPANY SURVEY (THREE </p><p>COMPANIES) IN TWO WEEKS.  I WOULD APPRECIATE A </p><p>COMMITMENT BY HR/OE AND NEA/SA/EX TO MOVE FORWARD </p><p>RAPIDLY ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND BEST REGARDS. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
