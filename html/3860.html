<p>UNCLAS ROME 004755 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDA FOR FSIS SCARBROUGH </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA SETH WINNICK, EB HANS KLEMM </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAGR, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT:  EC MEMBERSHIP IN FAO CODEX COMMISSION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  SECSTATE 191031 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. MISOFF SHARED </p><p>REFTEL INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04755  020543Z </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>(FAO) CODEX ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION WITH CANADIAN DEPUTY </p><p>PERM REP (DPR).  CANADA CURRENTLY REPRESENTS NORTH </p><p>AMERICA ON THE FAO\'S COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND </p><p>LEGAL MATTERS WHERE THIS ISSUE WILL BE DISCUSSED OCTOBER </p><p>2-3, 2002.  CANADIAN DPR STATED THAT HIS OWN INSTRUCTIONS </p><p>WERE DIFFERENT FROM U.S. INSTRUCTIONS AND PROMISED TO </p><p>CONSULT OTTAWA.  WASHINGTON MAY WISH TO DISCUSS THIS AS </p><p>WELL WITH CANADIAN COUNTERPARTS SO THAT U.S. AND CANADIAN </p><p>POSITIONS ARE AS SYNCHRONIZED AS POSSIBLE BEFORE THE </p><p>OPENING OF THE CCLM.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) MISOFF SHARED INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMISSION (EC) MEMBERSHIP IN THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S (FAO) CODEX ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION WITH </p><p>CANADIAN DEPUTY PERM REP (DPR).  CANADA CURRENTLY </p><p>REPRESENTS NORTH AMERICA ON THE FAO\'S COMMITTEE ON </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL MATTERS WHERE THIS ISSUE WILL BE </p><p>DISCUSSED OCTOBER 2-3, 2002. CANADIAN DPR STATED THAT HIS </p><p>OWN INSTRUCTIONS WERE DIFFERENT FROM U.S. INSTRUCTIONS </p><p>AND PROMISED TO CONSULT OTTAWA IMMEDIATELY (CONTACT IN </p><p>OTTAWA IS CHRIS MORAN, TEL 944-4847). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) ISSUE ONE:  EC MEMBER STATES DEVELOPING OR </p><p>SUPPORTING THE POSITION OF THE EC WITHIN ITS COMPETENCE: </p><p>CANADA IS PREPARED TO ACCEPT.  PER REFTEL, U.S. WOULD NOT </p><p>SUPPORT, BUT CONSIDER A "SPECIAL PROVISION."  SUCH A </p><p>PROVISION MIGHT ALLOW MEMBER STATE REPRESENTATIVES TO </p><p>SPEAK AS PART OF THE EC DELEGATION WITHIN EXISTING FAO </p><p>RULES, PARTICULARLY IN CLARIFYING COMPLICATED TECHNICAL </p><p>MATTERS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04755  020543Z </p><p> </p><p>RECOMMENDATION:  SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH OTTAWA TO COME </p><p>TO COMMON POSITION ALONG THE LINES OF U.S. POSITION. </p><p>U.S. POSITION RESPECTS PRINCIPLE OF "NO ADDITIONALITY" </p><p>WHICH IS THE BASIS OF CURRENT FAO PRACTICE AS REGARDS THE </p><p>EC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) ISSUE TWO:  EC PRESENCE DURING VOTE:  CANADA IS </p><p>PREPARED TO ACCEPT EC MEMBER ABSENCE FROM ROOM DURING EC </p><p>VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>RECOMMENDATION:  CCLM PAPER PREPARED BY FAO LEGAL OFFICE </p><p>RECOMMENDS THAT THIS ISSUE BE DECIDED IN THE CODEX </p><p>COMMISSION ITSELF; U.S. SUPPORTS THIS ADVICE. IN </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH CANADIAN DPR, CANADA APPEARS WILLING TO </p><p>ACCEPT DEFERRING A DECISION ON THIS TO THE COMMISSION. </p><p>THIS NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED WITH OTTAWA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) ISSUE THREE:  EC PARTICIPATION IN THE CODEX </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  CANADA IS PREPARED TO SUPPORT </p><p>ALLOWING EC TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMITTEE CONSISTENT </p><p>WITH CURRENT FAO PRACTICE.  U.S. PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE </p><p>THAT THE EC REP BE RECOGNIZED TO SPEAK AS A MEMBER OF </p><p>WHATEVER EU DELEGATION WAS A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>RECOMMENDATION:  THE FAO PROPOSAL IS IN LINE WITH CURRENT </p><p>PRACTICE AT THE FAO, WHERE THE EC PARTICIPATES IN THE FAO </p><p>COUNCIL AND IN OTHER LIMITED MEMBERSHIP BODIES SUCH AS </p><p>FAO DRAFTING COMMITTEES.  IN THESE INSTANCES THE EC IS </p><p>NOT CONSIDERED AN "ELECTED MEMBER" AND IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04755  020543Z </p><p>SERVE ON BUREAU POSITIONS; IT IS, HOWEVER, RECOGNIZED AS </p><p>THE EC AND GIVEN THE FLOOR ON ITEMS WHERE IT HAS DECLARED </p><p>COMPETENCE.  IN THESE SITUATIONS THE MEMBER STATE WHICH </p><p>IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LIMITED MEMBERSQ BODY DOES NOT </p><p>SPEAK ON THE SAME ISSUE.  THE CCLM IS LIKELY TO CONCLUDE </p><p>THAT THE U.S. PROPOSAL IS A DEVIATION FROM THE CURRENT </p><p>FAO PRACTICE.  IN DISCUSSING WITH CANADIANS, THE U.S. </p><p>MIGHT SUGGEST THAT A STALEMATE AT THE CCLM IS A PREFERRED </p><p>OUTCOME (WITH THE ISSUE BEING SENT BACK TO THE CODEX </p><p>COMMISSION FOR DISCUSSION AND/OR DECISION.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE ACTIONS OF THE </p><p>CODEX COMMISSION, AS A STANDARD SETTING BODY RECOGNIZED </p><p>BY THE WORLDQADE ORGANIZATION, ARE OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF </p><p>IMPORTANCE THAN MOST OF THE DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE FAO </p><p>GOVERNING BODIES.  NONETHELESS, FODAG\'S EXPERIENCE ON THE </p><p>GROUND IS THAT THE CURRENT FAO PRACTICE RESPECTS THE </p><p>PRINCIPLE OF "NO ADDITIONALITY" AND THAT EU MEMBER STATES </p><p>THEMSELVES ARE AN EFFECTIVE WATCHDOG IN ENSURING THAT THE </p><p>EC DOES NOT STRAY BEYOND ITS AREA OF COMPETENCE.  HALL </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04755 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
