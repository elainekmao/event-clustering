<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000809 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POST-ELECTIONS MEETING WITH NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY ADVISOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary:  Although admitting significant manipulation </p><p>of the presidential and  gubernatorial elections in some </p><p>states, National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed pointed to </p><p>the electoral tribunals as the appropriate channel for </p><p>resolution of these problems.  Mohammed said Obasanjo clearly </p><p>won the presidential contest; he dismissed ANPP candidate </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari\'s claims of victory. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Ambassador, accompanied by RAO Chief and CRO, met </p><p>National Security Advisor General (retired) Aliyu Mohammed </p><p>April 22 to review the April 19 presidential and </p><p>gubernatorial elections.  Mohammed appeared relaxed and in </p><p>good spirits.  The Ambassador asked for a comparison between </p><p>this election and the 1983 contest.  Mohammed noted that </p><p>General Buhari overthrew the democratically elected </p><p>government of Shehu Shegari in 1983, then "did nothing for 18 </p><p>months" except jail political opponents.  Mohammed pointed to </p><p>the irony of Buhari\'s current situation; Buhari, the leader </p><p>of the 1983 coup that toppled Nigeria\'s last civilian </p><p>government, was now complaining of democratic malpractices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C). Mohammed scoffed that Buhari "will make a lot of noise </p><p>now," but eventually will recede from prominence.  In </p><p>appraising Buhari\'s bid for the Presidency, Mohammed opined </p><p>that Buhari made a fundamental error by basing his campaign </p><p>on religion.  This, claimed Mohammed, limited Buhari\'s </p><p>appeal, confining his support to a group of northern states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) The Ambassador asked the NSA if President Obasanjo will </p><p>concede Buhari\'s status as king-maker in the north or if he </p><p>might have more decisive say in the formation of the new </p><p>Obasanjo Administration.  Mohammed rejected the </p><p>characterization of Buhari as the preeminent leader in </p><p>northern Nigeria.  That title still belonged to former </p><p>military Head of State, Ibrahim Babangida.  However, he </p><p>conceded that Buhari is a force to be reckoned with.  The NSA </p><p>predicted that, as was the case after the 1999 elections, </p><p>Obasanjo will bring into his government select members of the </p><p>defeated opposition parties.  The President will include some </p><p>members of Buhari\'s ANPP, but will do this "on his own terms, </p><p>not Buhari\'s." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C)  Pointing out that the ANPP has rejected the vote </p><p>results and threatened "mass action," the Ambassador asked if </p><p>the Presidency expects serious resistance from the main </p><p>opposition party.  Mohammed affirmed the likelihood of </p><p>resistance in parts of the Northwest where unemployment and </p><p>religion will fuel agitation.  The militant Odua People\'s </p><p>Congress (OPC) and other groups of unemployed youth will be </p><p>the basis for unrest in the Southwest, he predicted.  In </p><p>response to the Ambassador\'s question on how the Federal </p><p>Government will respond to such resistance, the NSA vaguely </p><p>said "we have our ways," but would not amplify any further. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) The Ambassador noted that international observers saw </p><p>severe irregularities in several parts of the country on </p><p>April 19; statements by IRI, NDI and the EU reflect this.  As </p><p>an example, he disclosed that he had photographic evidence of </p><p>stolen ballot boxes that were dumped in a ravine in Rivers </p><p>State.    Mohammed agreed there were problems in the </p><p>South-South and Southeast, citing Rivers, Bayelsa and Enugu </p><p>states specifically.  "I question some of these results </p><p>myself," he admitted.  The NSA expressed particular concern </p><p>over Rivers State, asserting that the Rivers controversy </p><p>needs to be taken to the electoral tribunal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Reviewing results from the Yoruba-dominated Southwest, </p><p>Mohammed admitted surprise at the large PDP gains made at the </p><p>expense of the AD.  He agreed with the conclusion that this </p><p>could be a mortal blow for Afenifere, the Yoruba </p><p>social-political organization, which the NSA characterized as </p><p>a gerontocracy that was too tribal-focused and out of touch </p><p>with the general populace in the Southwest.  Bola Tinubu, </p><p>though a top Yoruba politician, won the only Southwestern </p><p>state (Lagos) for the AD because he succeeded in appealing to </p><p>the cosmopolitan mix of voters in West Africa\'s largest </p><p>metropolis, concluded Mohammed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) Responding to the Ambassador\'s request for a summary </p><p>judgment on the elections, Mohammed proclaimed his support </p><p>for President Obasanjo, "based on the candidates available" </p><p>and predicted that Buhari would "go to the streets" and </p><p>attempt to call out the military to take over.  In response </p><p>to the Ambassador\'s request for any message to Washington on </p><p>the elections, Mohammed laughed and stated "you should </p><p>remember Florida in 2001 when Gore was gracious in accepting </p><p>defeat and in congratulating Bush . . .you should </p><p>congratulate Obasanjo."  Mohammed in turn asked the </p><p>Ambassador who from the USG should be invited to President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s May 29 inauguration, which the Ambassador </p><p>deflected by noting that this is for the GON to decide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) The NSA disclosed that he had written Obasanjo a </p><p>memorandum the previous day recommending that the President </p><p>meet with Ambassador Jeter, the UK High Commissioner and the </p><p>head of the EU Mission to discuss the elections aftermath and </p><p>the President\'s plans for his new term.  Mohammed hoped that </p><p>this meeting would take place later in the week.  (Note: This </p><p>meeting has yet to take place. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WARRI CRISIS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) Turning to the ongoing crisis in the oil-producing </p><p>area of Warri in Delta state,  Jeter gave Mohammed a letter </p><p>informing the Federal Government of our intent to provide </p><p>disaster relief assistance to Ijaw and Itsekiri villagers </p><p>displaced by the fighting and asking for approval to deliver </p><p>the aid in the Warri communities.  CRO emphasized that the </p><p>assistance is purely humanitarian -- food, clothing and </p><p>bedding -- and would be distributed equitably through a U.S. </p><p>non-governmental organization already operating in the Warri </p><p>area.  The NSA expressed appreciation for the humanitarian </p><p>initiative (and provided the requested approval in an April </p><p>27 letter), but cautioned that such efforts must be seen as </p><p>non-partisan, helping all affected parties.  In resolving the </p><p>stalemate in the region, the NSA claimed that force would not </p><p>be used unless necessary, but quickly added that "we cannot </p><p>allow a gang of thugs to terrorize the area."  Mohammed also </p><p>cited the serious problem of illegal bunkering of oil from </p><p>the area, a diversion of as much as 10 percent of Nigeria\'s </p><p>crude oil production to the black market.  Some of this </p><p>stolen crude is shipped to a refinery in Cote d\'Ivoire, where </p><p>oil is traded for weapons and sent back to the Ijaw militants </p><p>in the Warri area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) The meeting concluded with Mohammed noting that he </p><p>would be stepping down as National Security Advisor at the </p><p>time of President Obasanjo\'s May 29 inauguration but would </p><p>not offer any hints of possible continued public service in </p><p>the new Administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) Comment:  Mohammed\'s relationship with Obasanjo has </p><p>been rocky.  Neither trust the other and Obasanjo probably </p><p>feels that Mohammed always remained more loyal to Babangida </p><p>than to him.  However, in the contest against Buhari, both </p><p>Obasanjo and Mohammed were fellow travelers. Obasanjo wanted </p><p>to win; more than Obasanjo winning, Mohammed wanted Buhari to </p><p>lose.  A Buhari loss might just keep Babangida as the </p><p>strongest star in the northern political environment.  Now, </p><p>with the job done, Mohammed will exit the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration but this will not be the last we hear from </p><p>him.  However, the next time we see him, we expect that he </p><p>will be walking close to Babangida. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
