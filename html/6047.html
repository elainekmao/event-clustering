Summary.  Post recommends that Brazil remain on the </p><p>Priority Watch List for the 2003 Special 301 Review.  New </p><p>attention to entrenched IPR problems, particularly in the </p><p>copyright area, may be forthcoming under the new Lula </p><p>government.  Driven largely by concern over lost tax </p><p>revenues, impact on formal sector jobs, and harm to Brazilian </p><p>artists, the new administration, which assumed office January </p><p>1, has publicly acknowledged rampant piracy and </p><p>counterfeiting to be a Brazilian problem, and has vowed </p><p>action.  However, it is too early to assess the GOB\'s new </p><p>level of commitment.  Furthermore, despite some positive </p><p>groundwork laid by the Cardoso administration, the level of </p><p>IPR enforcement within Brazil remained grossly inadequate </p><p>during the last year.  Despite its new leadership and </p><p>staffing, the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Fighting Piracy </p><p>(IMC) has not yet proven its capacity for effecting </p><p>substantial, tangible improvements in copyright enforcement. </p><p>Likewise, the backlog of pharmaceutical patents continues to </p><p>grow due to the two-step patent application process, which </p><p>requires Ministry of Health approval, and insufficient </p><p>resources within Brazil\'s patent institute.  Maintaining the </p><p>status-quo on Special 301 status for Brazil strikes the </p><p>appropriate balance between recognition of a continued poor </p><p>IPR record, hopes that the new government will tackle the </p><p>issue in earnest, and reinforcement of the USG message that </p><p>IPR remains a priority within our bilateral agenda. </p><p> </p><p>Copyright - The Groundwork </p><p> </p><p>- Inter-Ministerial Committee: An Enigma or Force for Change? </p><p> </p><p>2.  As IIPA notes in its submission, much stock was placed in </p><p>the creation of the Inter-Ministerial Committee to Fight </p><p>Piracy (IMC) in March 2001.  There was an expectation that </p><p>the IMC would provide the vehicle through which the GOB could </p><p>finally articulate and act on a national strategy for </p><p>copyright enforcement.  However, far from being a dynamic </p><p>force for change, the IMC was not a functioning entity in </p><p>2001.  Even GOB officials have acknowledged the IMC\'s less </p><p>than stellar 2001 performance, during a November 2002 </p><p>Bilateral Consultative Mechanism meeting and more recently in </p><p>meetings with DOC A/S Lash on February 27.  While copyright </p><p>industries are correct in asserting that tangible results </p><p>still remained elusive in 2002, the following changes in the </p><p>IMC should be noted as having positive potential. </p><p> </p><p>3. In March 2002, a new coordinator, Clovis da Silva </p><p>Monteiro, was named to head the IMC.  Monteiro was tasked </p><p>solely with running the IMC, in contrast to his predecessor, </p><p>who had retained his drug-fighting responsibilities as a </p><p>senior police official in Rio de Janeiro during his IMC </p><p>tenure.  Monteiro established within the Ministry of Justice </p><p>an IMC office staffed with four assistants, and had managed </p><p>to convene 10 IMC meetings by the end of 2002, many with </p><p>private sector representatives.  In November 2002, the IMC </p><p>produced an action plan for 2003 (USTR received a copy during </p><p>the Bilateral Consultative Mechanism meeting the same month). </p><p> </p><p>4. The action plan, a nine-page document, on first read </p><p>appears to suffer from over-generality; actions are only </p><p>described in broad terms.  For example, one action item is to </p><p>examine existing proposals for legislative reform and to </p><p>identify the need to improve other legal texts.  The item </p><p>fails to provide IMC views on specific IPR legislative </p><p>proposals or to identify actions to promote their adoption or </p><p>defeat.  This generality, at least in part, reflects the fact </p><p>that the IMC is a coordinating body ) it does not have the </p><p>authority to direct action by any other government body. </p><p> </p><p>5. As explained by Elza Marcelino de Castro, chief of </p><p>Itamaraty\'s Intellectual Property Division and Itamaraty\'s </p><p>representative to the IMC, specific actions are not </p><p>identified in the IMC action plan because implementation is </p><p>the responsibility of the individual ministries that comprise </p><p>the group.  She notes, for instance, that after IMC </p><p>discussions and consensus, Itamaraty recently sent a note to </p><p>the Brazilian Congress urging action on long-pending </p><p>legislation on integrated circuitry.  She also claims that an </p><p>action plan with greater specificity exists, but is not </p><p>public.  Likewise, it is difficult to find the imprint of the </p><p>IMC on police enforcement actions.  Monteiro, who hails from </p><p>the Federal Police corps, claims to be intimately involved in </p><p>promoting and coordinating police activity country-wide.  He </p><p>admits, however, that he generally obtains results more from </p><p>drawing on his personal credibility and experience within law </p><p>enforcement than as head of the IMC. </p><p> </p><p>6. Monteiro has apparently succeeded in elevating IPR as an </p><p>issue within Mercosul.  Due to his efforts, IPR was included </p><p>for the first time within a Mercosul Presidential Declaration </p><p>during the group\'s summit in Brasilia in December 2002. </p><p>Itamaraty has confirmed that the issue is on the Mercosul </p><p>agenda for follow-up at the ministerial level.  Brazil\'s </p><p>actions in this regard are driven by its concern over pirated </p><p>materials being smuggled across its borders, principally from </p><p>Paraguay. </p><p> </p><p>7. Another action under IMC discussion is formation of a task </p><p>force to deal with counterfeit products.  In a conference on </p><p>IPR enforcement held in Rio de Janeiro in late November 2002, </p><p>tax losses and potential harm to consumers from counterfeit </p><p>products figured prominently.  A representative of Receita </p><p>Federal, the GOB\'s IRS, was quoted extensively on the </p><p>substantial tax losses from counterfeit products, principally </p><p>cigarettes and gasoline.  Given the federal government\'s </p><p>tight budget situation and focus on tax issues, greater GOB </p><p>attention can logically be expected in this area during the </p><p>coming months. </p><p> </p><p>8. The Ministry of Justice is reportedly looking into the </p><p>possibility of forming a task force comprised of </p><p>representatives from the country\'s various police units. </p><p>This would be a welcome complement to the more </p><p>policy-oriented IMC.  Monteiro also claims that the IMC is </p><p>encouraging other municipalities to establish IPR task </p><p>forces, similar to Sao Paulo\'s, but admits that convincing </p><p>local authorities with tight resources that investments </p><p>should be made in this area is an uphill battle. </p><p> </p><p>9. An area of increasing focus by some of the copyright </p><p>industries is Brazil\'s judicial system, in particular, the </p><p>lack of convictions and of deterrent sentencing.  According </p><p>to Itamaraty\'s de Castro, while establishment of separate IPR </p><p>courts is not envisioned, the IMC is discussing how to </p><p>cultivate IPR expertise within the judicial system.  She </p><p>notes, however, that executive branch initiatives in this </p><p>area are not always welcomed by the independent judiciary. </p><p> </p><p>10. While the IMC\'s lack of overarching authority will </p><p>continue to undermine its ability to forcefully carry out a </p><p>nation-wide strategy for improving IPR protection within </p><p>Brazil, it still represents the best vehicle at present for </p><p>focusing IPR enforcement issues at the federal level. </p><p>Private sector associations interested in IPR issues are </p><p>seeking increased involvement in the work of the IMC, with </p><p>some requesting a seat on the committee.  Enhanced </p><p>involvement in the IMC by the private sector could lead to </p><p>better focus and more concrete results. </p><p> </p><p>-Optical Media: New Digital Codes Requirement </p><p> </p><p>11. The promulgation of Presidential Decree 4533 on December </p><p>19, 2002 provides implementing regulations for Article 113 of </p><p>Brazil\'s 1998 Copyright Law concerning identification codes </p><p>for copyright products.  The decree requires that music and </p><p>audiovisual works, whether optically read or not, include </p><p>codes identifying the original work, the production company, </p><p>catalogue number, the lot code and number of copies contained </p><p>within the lot, as well as an International Standard </p><p>Recording Code providing information on the respective </p><p>artists and other information provided by the producer.  The </p><p>decree is due to become effective April 22, 2003. Local </p><p>industry is divided on whether or not this requirement will </p><p>prove to be an effective IPR enforcement tool, or merely a </p><p>mechanism for better accounting between production companies </p><p>and artists.  The local software industry association (ABES), </p><p>for instance, opposes the decree.  However, Castro argues </p><p>that the decree will help reduce illegal sales of works that </p><p>are stolen from legitimate production facilities, which she </p><p>claims have been significant. </p><p> </p><p>Patents ) No Recovery Expected Soon </p><p> </p><p>12.  Despite GOB officials -- such as the acting head of </p><p>Brazil\'s National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI), </p><p>Minister Furlan who oversees INPI as the head of the Ministry </p><p>of Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC), Under-Secretary </p><p>Hugueney of Itamaraty\'s U/S of Integration, Economics and </p><p>Trade, and Senator Mercadante (PT)- recently acknowledging </p><p>the magnitude of the problem, no immediate reduction in the </p><p>pharmaceutical patent backlog is expected.  Firm figures on </p><p>INPI\'s pending patent applications are hard to come by, but </p><p>PhRMA\'s estimate of 45,000 pending patent applications, of </p><p>which approximately 18,000 are pharmaceutical patents, </p><p>appears reasonable. </p><p> </p><p>13. INPI claims the backlog is due to its lack of resources; </p><p>INPI currently has 80 examiners and only a few computer </p><p>terminals.  INPI has requested approval from the central GOB </p><p>to hire 350 examiners over the next five years and expand its </p><p>number of computers.  However, the government\'s tight budget </p><p>situation casts doubt on the likelihood of this occurring. </p><p>Even Itamaraty\'s de Castro admitted to econoff that without a </p><p>dramatic increase in resources for INPI, the patent backlog </p><p>will persist for many years.  INPI is currently training 27 </p><p>new examiners, 20 of which will reportedly focus on </p><p>pharmaceutical patents.  The required approval of the </p><p>Ministry of Health\'s regulatory agency, ANVISA, in addition </p><p>to raising TRIPS compliance concerns, also adds to patent </p><p>processing uncertainty and delays.  However, in a February 27 </p><p>meeting with DOC A/S Lash, Hugueney reported that the GOB </p><p>will be initiating a review in March of its policy regarding </p><p>ANVISA\'s role in the patent approval process. </p><p> </p><p>Biotechnology </p><p> </p><p>14. As noted in the American Soybean Association\'s (ASA) </p><p>Special 301 submission, piracy associated with Roundup Ready </p><p>has been a burgeoning trend.  Past denial by the GOB of the </p><p>existence of illegal plantings of Roundup Ready, which is </p><p>estimated to have reached as high as 70 to 90 percent of the </p><p>soybean crop in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, has hindered </p><p>Monsanto\'s ability to exercise its patent rights.  The Lula </p><p>administration has recently recognized the widespread use of </p><p>Roundup Ready and is deliberating on what to do about the </p><p>"illegal" GMO plantings within the 2002-2003 crop.  It is </p><p>unclear at this point to what extent if any this </p><p>acknowledgment of the pervasive use of Roundup Ready will </p><p>assist Monsanto in pursuing its patent claims. </p><p> </p><p>TRIPS Compliance: Data Confidentiality </p><p> </p><p>15. On December 17, 2002, the Brazilian Congress passed Law </p><p>10,603 intending to bring the data confidentiality portions </p><p>of the industrial property law fully in line with TRIPS.  The </p><p>law provides data protection for 10 years from the date of </p><p>patent registration for products utilizing new chemical </p><p>molecules or new biological organisms or until the first </p><p>release of the information by the patent holder, with a </p><p>minimum guaranteed period of protection of one year.  For </p><p>products not utilizing new molecule or organisms, the period </p><p>of protection is five years or until the first release of </p><p>information by the patent holder with a one-year minimum </p><p>period of protection.  For data generated after patent </p><p>registration, the period of protection will coincide with the </p><p>patent period or one year from when the data was divulged, </p><p>whichever is longer.  USTR is evaluating whether or not the </p><p>legislation is TRIPS compliant. </p><p> </p><p>Treaty Ratification </p><p> </p><p>16. Itamaraty has confirmed that the GOB does not currently </p><p>have plans to ratify the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty or the </p><p>WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation </p><p> </p><p>17. Post believes that the lack of tangible improvements in </p><p>IPR protection and enforcement in the last year manifestly </p><p>precludes lowering Brazil\'s Special 301 status.  We concur </p><p>with industry submissions that suggest that retaining Brazil </p><p>as a Priority Watch List country will appropriately highlight </p><p>for the new government the importance of the issue in our </p><p>bilateral relationship, without appearing to prejudge its </p><p>policies and actions in this area.  Nonetheless, we request </p><p>that, should Brazil\'s status be maintained, USTR\'s </p><p>announcement highlight the USG\'s recognition of the positive </p><p>intentions expressed by the Lula administration regarding IPR </p><p>and the USG\'s desire to work collaboratively with it to </p><p>improve its IPR regime in the coming year. </p><p>GOUGHNOUR </p><p></p></div>
