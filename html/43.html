MOD SOURCES HAVE INFORMED EMBASSY OF THE </p><p>FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>SYRIAN LINES IN THE NORTH HAVE NOT REPEAT NOT </p><p>CHANGED.  HOWEVER, REDISPOSITION OF UNITS HAS </p><p>TAKEN PLACE TO INCLUDE POSITIONING OF TWO STALIN </p><p>MULTIPLE 36 TWO ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND A PLATOON </p><p>(5) OF TANKS ON KEY TERRAIN FEATURE (OVERLOOKING </p><p>VILLAGE OF IBRIE WHICH FACES THE CAZA OF </p><p>JUBAYL (BYBLOS) WHICH IS JA\'JA\'S TURF.)  ADDITIONALLY, </p><p>WHAT APPEARS TO BE SYRIAN ARMORED BATTALION (20- </p><p>25 TANKS) HAS TAKEN UP POSITIONS BETWEEN BATROUN </p><p>AND SHIKA.  3,000 TROOPS OF THE PALESTINE LIBERATION </p><p>ARMY ALSO HAVE MOVED INTO POSITIONS AROUND </p><p>BISHRI, WHICH IS HOME VILLAGE OF JA\'JA\', AND THEY </p><p>ARE FORTIFYING THESE POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.

BUT IF THE SYRIANS USE FORCE </p><p>AGAINST THE DISSIDENTS IT WILL HAVE DEVASTATING </p><p>IMPACT ON THE ENTIRE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY AND COULD </p><p>WELL FORCE THEM TO RALLY ROUND THE FLAG CARRIED </p><p>BY THE JA JA GROUP.  WE WOULD ALSO BE BLAMED </p><p>BY SOME--CITING OUR "DEFACTO ALLIANCE" WITH THE </p><p>SYRIANS AGAINST THE DISSIDENTS--AND SUBJECTED TO </p><p>APPEALS TO INTERCEDE WITH THE SYRIANS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SYRIA MAY, INDEED, BE ONLY RATTLING ITS </p><p>SABER AT THIS POINT.  WASHINGTON AND DAMASCUS </p><p>MIGHT NONETHELESS CONSIDER APPROACHING SARG </p><p>TO CITE REPORTS OF SYRIAN REDISPOSITIONS AND TO </p><p>SAY THAT CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IS WORKING POLITICAL </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL DISPUTE AND SYRIAN USE </p><p>OF FORCE WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND </p><p>DAMAGING FOR UNITY AND STABILITY OF LEBANON.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DAO REPORT IRR 6 857 0135 85 CONTAINS FURTHER </p><p>INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
