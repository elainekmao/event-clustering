<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 008356 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND GUNARATNE </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AK PARTY BEGINS TO ENGAGE ON THE ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 7549 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 6259 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  In the past week, AK Party moved to </p><p>inject discipline into its public statements on the economy, </p><p>initiated contacts with the economic bureaucracy, and </p><p>reiterated its intention to work with the IMF.  AK Economic </p><p>Coordinator Ali Babacan sought to reassure us that, despite </p><p>some unfortunate public statements, AK had no intention of </p><p>pursuing populist policies or weakening independent </p><p>regulatory boards.  Vice Chairman Ali Coskun said the new </p><p>government would annul the financial amnesty law (scheduled </p><p>to take effect January 2003), move quickly to pass a budget </p><p>and a tax reform law, and accelerate privatization.  Anxious </p><p>to avoid the perception that they are accepting IMF dictates, </p><p>the incoming government hopes to quietly negotiate an IMF </p><p>agreement and present it as the national program. There are </p><p>differences among the AK officials with whom we met on policy </p><p>details - announcing the ministerial appointments, which </p><p>could begin next week, will lead to greater clarity on the </p><p>economic policy direction of the new government.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  In a series of meetings November 11 - 13, we met </p><p>with several AK candidates for ECON-related ministerial jobs: </p><p> AK Vice Chairman Ali Coskun; head of AK\'s Econ coordinating </p><p>committee Ali Babacan; head of AK party operations Abdullatif </p><p>Sener.  All three stressed AK\'s interest in engaging the </p><p>international financial community, both the markets and the </p><p>IFIs, and all spoke about an AK government program under </p><p>development.  It was clear that ministerial appointment </p><p>decisions had not yet been made. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First Steps:  Greater Discipline with Press; </p><p>Meeting with Bureaucrats </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Ali Babacan is the most "market friendly" AK </p><p>figure, per banking and market contacts.  He told us several </p><p>post-election statements of AK figures had been </p><p>"unfortunate," referring to statements on the banking board, </p><p>tax cuts and agricultural subsidies.  These statements </p><p>reflect people jockeying for ministerial jobs, he continued, </p><p>not AK policy.  At November 8 and 9 AK meetings of the </p><p>governing board and senior advisors, Erdogan had reined in </p><p>such statements, saying that only Abdullah Gul was authorized </p><p>to talk about the economy.  "You won\'t see much in the media </p><p>from now on," Babacan said, stressing the need for perception </p><p>management. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On November 14, Gul gave a short statement to the </p><p>press, following AK\'s first meeting on the economy.  AK </p><p>Chairman Tayyip Erdogan and 25 AK deputies attended the </p><p>meeting including Gul.  They were briefed by Central Bank </p><p>Governor Serdengecti and Treasury U/S Oztrak.  In a brief </p><p>statement, Gul told the press that one-party rule provides </p><p>Turkey a good chance, that the new government would continue </p><p>structural reforms, and that he expected the IMF Fourth </p><p>Review to take place in January.  (Note:  IMF resrep told us </p><p>that Babacan later clarified that Gul meant that the IMF </p><p>board meeting for the Fourth Review should take place in </p><p>January.)  In response to a press question on whether AK </p><p>would replace senior bureaucrats, Gul said: "We will take  an </p><p>objective view of the public sector.  We will work with </p><p>bureaucrats who are hard-working, know their jobs well, and </p><p>share our enthusiasm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  After the AK briefing, Central Bank Governor </p><p>Serdengecti told us he was impressed with the level of </p><p>preparation of the AK deputies.  They listened carefully, </p><p>took notes, and asked "intelligent" questions.  While </p><p>Serdengecti has the impression that some in the AK leadership </p><p>"don\'t get it," many others do.  Serdengecti was particularly </p><p>supportive of AK\'s plan to come up with its own reform plan, </p><p>i.e., take full ownership of a plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Next Steps - National Economic Reform Program </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Babacan told us Abdullah Gul was heading AK\'s </p><p>efforts to develop a detailed action plan for the new </p><p>government on the full range of issues.  This action plan </p><p>would detail steps in the first month, first two months, </p><p>first three months, etc..  As part of this project, AK would </p><p>meet with other bureaucrats, in the Finance Ministry and </p><p>independent boards.  In the meantime, Babacan cautioned, the </p><p>only definitive AK policy statement is contained in its </p><p>election platform, which Babacan had helped draft. </p><p>7.  (SBU)  In separate meetings, our AK interlocutors </p><p>stressed the need for the new government to present its own </p><p>"national economic program," in which AK would be fully </p><p>vested.  They added that this would be done in consultation </p><p>with the IMF.  Sener noted that "90 percent of AK voters" </p><p>don\'t like the IMF, but AK intentionally didn\'t feed this </p><p>sentiment, and was clear during the election campaign that </p><p>the new government needed to work with the IMF and other </p><p>international financial institutions.  Babacan envisioned a </p><p>process whereby AK starts informal talks with the IMF </p><p>immediately, and not include the bureaucrats, who might leak </p><p>things to the press before they are agreed.  The goal would </p><p>be to have IMF agreement on the broad outlines of a program, </p><p>then invite the IMF mission for official talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Policies Still Unclear </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) We heard a variety of somewhat differing ideas in </p><p>separate meetings with Coskun, Babacan and Sener on the </p><p>substance of economic policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  On fiscal policy, all noted that AK was careful during </p><p>elections not to promise government hand-outs, and that the </p><p>new GOT would focus on expenditure cuts.  Erdogan proposed to </p><p>the AK parliamentary deputies that they forego their GOT </p><p>housing as a symbolic gesture, and the proposal had been </p><p>adopted by acclamation.  Babacan said Erdogan had been </p><p>pressed hard on hazel nut support prices, and now regretted </p><p>saying anything about it (note: Erdogan had told the press </p><p>November 8 that hazelnut support prices for some Black Sea </p><p>provinces would continue).  Babacan said the new GOT would </p><p>avoid populist measures.  On the other hand, Coskun said one </p><p>of the priorities of the new GOT would be a package of </p><p>measures to stimulate the real sector, without specifying </p><p>these measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Both Coskun and Babacan confirmed an intention to offer a </p><p>limited tax amnesty, which they clarified would be intended </p><p>to reschedule debts for back taxes.  Coskun estimates that </p><p>back taxes amount to TL 9.5 quadrillion, and the new law is </p><p>intended to collect some of it.  (Comment:  Finance Ministry </p><p>experts tell us that the main problem at present in meeting </p><p>this year\'s primary surplus target is a slowing of tax </p><p>collection efforts, based on a perception that an amnesty is </p><p>around the corner.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Coskun also spoke of annulling or delaying enforcement of </p><p>a "financial year zero" law, enacted in 1998 and scheduled to </p><p>come into effect on January 1, 2003.  This law requires </p><p>Turkish residents to declare the sources of their financial </p><p>holdings starting in 2003.  Coskun said the law when enacted </p><p>had resulted in capital outflows; annulling it now would </p><p>bolster market morale. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  On the BRSA and other independent agencies, they said AK </p><p>would make  changes, but per Babacan "whatever we do will </p><p>ensure greater independence, more transparency, more timely </p><p>reporting."  Coskun and others criticized the excessive </p><p>spending of the independent boards.  (Comment:  BRSA </p><p>officials tell us that Yapi Kredi Bank owner Mehmet Emin </p><p>Karamehment has broken off talks with BRSA about his </p><p>estimated $2 billion in unpaid loans to the bank. </p><p>Karamehment is instead lobbying AK members, and holding out </p><p>for a better deal.  Yapi Kredi applied to the Capital Markets </p><p>Board for a 15 day delay in releasing its third quarter </p><p>financials, and the application was accepted November 15. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Other priorities mentioned by AK interlocutors include </p><p>passing a tax reform law (note: submitting such a law to </p><p>parliament is a Fourth Review condition); accelerating </p><p>privatization (Coskun was critical of the government\'s </p><p>performance on privatization); and removing obstacles to </p><p>foreign investment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) AK\'s greater discipline on press statements </p><p>demonstrates a sharp learning curve, and the normally </p><p>critical Central Bank Governor is impressed with the </p><p>seriousness of AK\'s leadership.  The markets remain buoyed by </p><p>the prospects of a strong government implementing a reform </p><p>program in harmony with the IMF.  But without an econ team in </p><p>place, and with the policies of the new government still </p><p>unclear, the market\'s two-week rally remains fragile.  Our </p><p>discussions this week reveal differences among the AK </p><p>economic team; appointments expected next week should clarify </p><p>at least the personalities who will be involved. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
