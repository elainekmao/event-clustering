SIMEST ALSO UNDERTAKES SPECIAL </p><p>CUSTOMIZED SEARCHES FOR POTENTIAL PARTNERS OR PROJECTS ON BEHALF OF </p><p>ITALIAN COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>C) ORIGINALLY, THERE WAS AN ICE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE FOR 400.000 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00642  02 OF 02  081650Z </p><p>ITALIAN LIRE (ABOUT USD 200) THAT ENTITLED SUBSCRIBERS TO A 30 PERCEN </p><p>DISCOUNT ON ALL SERVICES.  THERE WAS NO CHARGE FOR REPORTS, STUDIES </p><p>AND STATISTICS, ONLY FOR ASSISTED SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>THE ARE TWO TYPES OF ASSISTED SERVICES:  SPECIALIZED AND PERSONALIZED </p><p>ALTHOUGH THESE NAMES ARE CONSIDERED AMBIGUOUS AND WILL PROBABLY CHANG </p><p>IN THE FUTURE.  SPECIALIZED SERVICES ARE DOCUMENTS, STUDIES, AND </p><p>CONSULTATIONS THAT ARE SOLD AT FIXED PRICES.  PERSONALIZED SERVICE </p><p>PRICES ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON PERSONNEL-HOURS AND COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>ICE HAS DEVELOPED A LIST OF CITIES WHERE IT HAS OFFICES, DEFINING </p><p>THESE CITIES AS BEING IN DEVELOPING, NEWLY INDUSTRIALIZED, AND </p><p>INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES.  WHEN ICE WAS QUESTIONED ON HOW THE CRITERI </p><p>FOR THESE CATEGORIES WERE DETERMINED, IT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO </p><p>HARD AND FAST RULE.  SOME OF THESE ARE FAIRLY OBVIOUS, BUT OTHERS SEE </p><p>RATHER ARBITRARY.   MONTREAL AND AMSTERDAM ARE ON THE "NEWLY </p><p>INDUSTRIALIZED LIST," FOR EXAMPLE.  IT SEEMS THAT, BECAUSE THE LISTS </p><p>ARE USED TO CALCULATE COSTS, COST OF LIVING IS THE BOTTOM LINE.  COST </p><p>PER PERSON/DAY FOR ICE SERVICES IS AS FOLLOWS:  IN DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES, 260 EUROS (ABOUT 260 USD); IN NEWLY INDUSTRIALIZED </p><p>COUNTRIES, 300 EUROS (ABOUT 300 USD); AND IN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES </p><p>360 EUROS (ABOUT USD).  SERVICES IN COUNTRIES NOT ON THE LIST HAVE TH </p><p>SAME COST AS THEIR SO-CALLED COUNTRY OF JURISDICTION. </p><p> </p><p>THE DOWNSIDE OF CHARGING FOR PRODUCTS THAT ONCE WERE FREE OF CHARGE, </p><p>ICE OFFICIALS SAY, IS THE DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR THESE PRODUCTS. </p><p>HOWEVER, THESE PRODUCTS ARE VIEWED AS A NEW SOURCE OF REVENUE, WHICH, </p><p>IT IS HOPED, WILL INCREASE OVER TIME.  BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS STILL </p><p>QUITE NEW, IT IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE SUCCESS AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>ICE IS NOT ENGAGED IN SERIOUS COST-RECOVERY (ALTHOUGH IT HAS TAKEN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00642  02 OF 02  081650Z </p><p>LIMITED STEPS TO CHARGE FEES IN PROPORTION TO COST).  COST-RECOVERY I </p><p>NOT THE MAJOR CONCERN TO THE GOI THAT IT IS TO THE USG IN SUCH AREAS. </p><p>IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ICE TO DO A ROBUST COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF ITS </p><p>SERVICES, FOR LAST YEAR\'S PRIVACY LAW ALLOWS IT ACCESS ONLY TO </p><p>AGGREGATE DATA RATHER THAN TO INFORMATION REGARDING PARTICULAR </p><p>TRANSACTIONS THAT MIGHT FLOW FROM, FOR EXAMPLE, AN ICE TRADE SHOW. </p><p> </p><p>D) THE ICE PRE-PAID "SERVICE CARD" IS AVAILABLE IN THREE CATEGORIES </p><p>AND IS VALID FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE.  EACH LEVEL IS WORT </p><p>A CERTAIN NUMBER OF POINTS THAT CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE ON-LINE </p><p>SERVICES (TRADE LEADS, INFORMATION ON TENDERS, PURCHASE OF STUDIES, </p><p>DOCUMENTS, AND STATISTICS) AND OFFERS DISCOUNTS ON PERSONALIZED </p><p>SERVICES AT ANY OF THE ICE OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THE BASIC </p><p>LEVEL IS WORTH 250 POINTS, OFFERS A 10 PERCENT DISCOUNT, AND COSTS 13 </p><p>EUROS (ABOUT USD 125).  SUPER IS WORTH 500 POINTS, OFFERS A 15 PERCEN </p><p>DISCOUNT, AND COSTS 230 EUROS (ABOUT USD 220).  GLOBAL IS WORTH 1000 </p><p>POINTS, OFFERS A 25 PERCENT DISCOUNT, AND COSTS 400 EUROS (ABOUT USD </p><p>380). </p><p> </p><p>CARDS CAN BE OBTAINED ONLINE USING A CREDIT CARD OR BY MAILING OR </p><p>FAXING THE REQUEST FORM TO ICE\'S OFFICE.  CUSTOMERS CAN PURCHASE </p><p>DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS ONLINE OR MAY REQUEST BOUND COPIES OF THESE </p><p>MATERIALS FROM ICE FOR A HIGHER PRICE.  THE PROGRAM IS STILL NEW </p><p>(INITIATED IN OCTOBER 2001), BUT IT SEEMS THAT FORMER SUBSCRIPTION </p><p>HOLDERS ARE BUYING THE CARDS.  ICE WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA IN THE </p><p>FUTURE AS TO WHETHER THE NEW PROGRAM HAS DRAWN NEW CUSTOMERS. </p><p> </p><p>(ORIGIN: FCS ROME/ECOLOMBO/BMCCLEARY) </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00642  02 OF 02  081650Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00642 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
