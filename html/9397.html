<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001797 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KWMN, PGOV, SOCI, VM, TIP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW EFFORTS TO COMBAT PROSTITUTION IN VIETNAM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary.  A new ordinance should strengthen efforts </p><p>aimed at combating prostitution in Vietnam and its related </p><p>effects.  The most striking point of the new ordinance is </p><p>its inclusion of purchasers of sex, specifically focusing on </p><p>government officials, thus expanding prohibited acts to </p><p>include demand-side offenders.  Doubts remain about its </p><p>practical application, however.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On March 17, the National Assembly Standing </p><p>Committee (NASC) passed a new Ordinance on Prostitution </p><p>Prevention and Combat, which came into effect July 1. </p><p>According to Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social </p><p>Affairs (MOLISA) official Nguyen Thi Hue, previous laws and </p><p>regulations had been insufficient, overlapping, or even </p><p>conflicting.  This new ordinance aims at rectifying gaps in </p><p>the Criminal Code and at unifying overall policy, with an </p><p>emphasis on prevention and education. </p><p> </p><p>THE ORDINANCE AND IMPLICATIONS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The ordinance\'s Article 4 provides a broad listing </p><p>that "strictly prohibits buying and selling sex, harboring </p><p>or organizing prostitution activities, forcing, brokering, </p><p>or protecting prostitution, abusing the service business for </p><p>prostitution activities, as well as other acts related to </p><p>prostitution activities as prescribed by law."  "Buying" is </p><p>the new element here; previous legislation failed to </p><p>designate purchasing sex as an offense.  The ordinance </p><p>defines "sex" as "sexual intercourse." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Although the ordinance breaks no new ground on </p><p>criminal liability, it does define cases that entail </p><p>administrative penalties.  Article 22 provides that "sex </p><p>buyers shall, depending on the nature and seriousness of </p><p>their violations, be administratively handled in the form of </p><p>caution and fine."  For public officials, the measures </p><p>become even sterner:  Article 27 requires that "officials, </p><p>public employees and/or people\'s armed force personnel who </p><p>commit acts violating law provisions on prostitution </p><p>prevention and combat shall, apart from being handled under </p><p>the provisions prescribed in articles of the ordinance, have </p><p>their acts notified to the heads of their competent managing </p><p>agencies, organizations or units for education and </p><p>disciplining . . .  [and] during the period of being </p><p>disciplined, not be appointed nor stand for election . . . </p><p>nor be appointed or re-appointed to equivalent or higher </p><p>posts in the State agencies or the people\'s armed forces." </p><p>According to the media, the NASC decided against a </p><p>requirement to inform family members of cases in which </p><p>government officials were caught with prostitutes. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The ordinance reaffirms penal liability for buyers </p><p>of "sex with minors" and for those who "though being aware </p><p>of their HIV infection, deliberately transmit the disease." </p><p>It also specifically reiterated penal liabilities for those </p><p>who engage in trafficking in women and/or children, as well </p><p>as those who act as "go-betweens for" or harbor or coerce </p><p>prostitution.  The ordinance retains existing administrative </p><p>sanctions, including possible re-education and/or medical </p><p>treatment, for prostitutes themselves. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The ordinance tasks MOLISA with "formulating, and </p><p>organizing the implementation of, policies and plans on </p><p>prostitution prevention and combat" in coordination with </p><p>other agencies and organizations.  The Ministry of Public </p><p>Security (MPS) "shall have to organize the prevention and </p><p>combat of crimes of prostitution and trafficking in women </p><p>and children in service of prostitution activities as well </p><p>as law violations related to prostitution."  MPS shall also </p><p>coordinate with MOLISA and other agencies "in directing, </p><p>guiding and organizing the community-based management and </p><p>education of prostitutes as well as persons committing </p><p>prostitution-related acts."  Article 24 defines persons </p><p>committing prostitution-related acts as "those who protect </p><p>prostitution, contribute capital for use for prostitution </p><p>purposes."  This latter group shall be administratively </p><p>sanctioned or examined for penal liability "depending on the </p><p>nature and seriousness of their violations." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) According to media, USD$1.5 million will be </p><p>allocated for implementation of this ordinance, which one </p><p>MOLISA official admitted to reporters was a "very </p><p>insufficient" sum. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Comment:  The GVN takes seriously its efforts to </p><p>combat trafficking in persons, although it remains </p><p>chronically strapped for operational funds.  Both the GVN </p><p>and Communist Party of Vietnam have also spoken repeatedly </p><p>and forcefully about the need to improve the moral tone of </p><p>officials and to ensure more suitable conduct in order to </p><p>preserve the dignity and authority of the State and Party. </p><p>Given the ever-more open nature of Vietnamese society, </p><p>endemic corruption, and access to prostitution and other </p><p>"social evils," there are widespread doubts that even this </p><p>new ordinance will prove particularly effective in dealing </p><p>with the general problem of prostitution, however. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
