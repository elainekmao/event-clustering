(C) An interagency delegation led by PRM Assistant </p><p>Secretary Arthur Dewey discussed a range of Iraq-related </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>humanitarian planning issues with the GOT, humanitarian </p><p>organizations and representatives of the two </p><p>Kurdish-administered areas of northern Iraq.  Dewey </p><p>emphasized the U.S. interest in working through UN agencies </p><p>in providing relief, and sought Turkish cooperation in </p><p>allowing transit of humanitarian relief to Iraq.  He also </p><p>maintained that any role for the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) </p><p>in northern Iraq would have to be coordinated with the </p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and with the </p><p>UN.  Dewey proposed to MFA a tripartite, civilian mechanism </p><p>with representatives of the GOT, UN, USG and possibly other </p><p>humanitarian organizations and donors to coordinate aid </p><p>through Turkey.  MFA responded favorably to the proposal, but </p><p>advised that it would need to consult with other agencies </p><p>before providing an authoritative response.  MFA also agreed </p><p>that ICRC and UN agencies would have the mandate for relief </p><p>in northern Iraq.  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Kurdistan </p><p>Democratic Party and UNICEF representatives emphasized the </p><p>hostility of the population in northern Iraq to Turkish </p><p>intervention.  The International Federation of Red Cross/Red </p><p>Crescent Societies representative said he has raised concerns </p><p>about the TRC,s planned role in northern Iraq with the TRC </p><p>leadership, but fears that the Turkish military may force </p><p>TRC,s hand.  UN representatives raised a number of concerns, </p><p>including anticipated delays in restarting the Oil for Food </p><p>Program after the onset of a conflict.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Assistant Secretary for Population, Migration and </p><p>Refugees Arthur Dewey, accompanied by Lawrence Bartlett, </p><p>Deputy Director, PRM/ANE; Dr. Joseph Collins, Deputy </p><p>Assistant Secretary of Defense; William Garvelink, USAID </p><p>Deputy Assistant Administrator; Richard Owens, Deputy </p><p>Coordinator for Humanitarian Assistance, Defense Department </p><p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance; and </p><p>David Tarantino, Office of the Secretary of Defense; </p><p>discussed contingency planning and humanitarian assistance </p><p>issues in Ankara March 12 and 13.  Military Coordination and </p><p>Liaison Command (MCLC) Commanding General Peter Osman joined </p><p>in the delegation,s meetings with the GOT.  The group met </p><p>with a GOT interagency group led by the Deputy Undersecretary </p><p>of Foreign Affairs Nabi Sensoy; Major General Suphi Acar, </p><p>Turkish General Staff, J-5; UN agency representatives in a </p><p>meeting led by Resident Coordinator Alfredo Witschi-Cestari; </p><p>and Turkish Red Crescent President Ertan Gonen.  A/S Dewey </p><p>also met with Carl Naucler, Head of Delegation, International </p><p>Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC); </p><p>Safeen Dizayee, Ankara Representative, Kurdistan Democratic </p><p>Party (KDP), and Bahros Galali, Ankara Representative, </p><p>Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK); and Jean-Marie Fakhouri, </p><p>UNHCR Regional Coordinator for the Iraq Situation, Amin Awad, </p><p>UNHCR Deputy Regional Coordinator for the Iraq Situation, and </p><p>Gesche Karrenbrock, UNHCR Turkey Representative on March 13. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOT Interagency Meeting </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The U.S. delegation held a wide-ranging discussion </p><p>on assistance issues with an interagency group chaired by </p><p>Deputy Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Nabi Sensoy.  The </p><p>Turkish side included representatives of the Prime </p><p>Ministry,s Emergency Management General Directorate, TGS, </p><p>and Customs, but only MFA officials addressed our delegation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Outlining USG priorities in humanitarian assistance </p><p>for Iraq and its neighbors, A/S Dewey stated that the U.S. </p><p>sought to share the costs of providing aid with other donors, </p><p>primarily through the UN system.  He noted that the UN </p><p>Regional Humanitarian Coordination Office in Cyprus, which he </p><p>had just visited, is now in place, and that the USG sought to </p><p>create the conditions which would allow a swift return of UN </p><p>personnel to Iraq after the potential conflict is over. </p><p>Dewey maintained that the World Food Program (WFP) would be </p><p>critical in restarting the Oil for Food (OFF) Program, which </p><p>would likely be disrupted with the onset of hostilities.  The </p><p>key problem now is funding the relief effort.  He noted that </p><p>solving the food issue and ensuring that the Iraqis feel </p><p>secure that relief will come to them timely is essential to </p><p>preventing mass population movements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Coordination Mechanism:  Dewey also noted that the </p><p>U.S. ) Kuwaiti Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) had been </p><p>activated and would help the humanitarian effort, but that a </p><p>different mechanism should be adopted in Turkey.  He </p><p>suggested a civilian, trilateral mechanism with the GOT, UN </p><p>agencies and USG as the key participants, but which could </p><p>include other relevant humanitarian organizations and donors. </p><p> Dewey suggested that the group meet at the policy level in </p><p>Ankara, and that subgroups working on more operational issues </p><p>meet in Diyarbakir and perhaps Silopi.  Sensoy responded that </p><p>the GOT would consider the issue and respond to us quickly. </p><p>Note:  MFA officials subsequently told us that they accepted </p><p>this proposal, but needed to consult within the GOT before </p><p>providing us with a definitive response.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Sensoy noted that, following the March 1 vote on </p><p>deployment of U.S. troops, Turkey,s role in the Iraq crisis </p><p>was not clear, but he assured us that regardless of whether </p><p>Turkey is a member of the military coalition or not, the GOT </p><p>would like to cooperate on humanitarian issues.  He also </p><p>provided an overview of humanitarian logistics and routes, </p><p>and passed us list of storage facilities, ports, airports, </p><p>and roads designated for HA (septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Turkish Plans for Camps in Northern Iraq:  Recalling </p><p>Turkey,s refugee debacle in 1991, Sensoy maintained that the </p><p>GOT was determined to prevent a recurrence.  He noted the </p><p>geographic limitation to Turkey\'s accession to the Geneva </p><p>Refugee Convention, and said the Turks expect third countries </p><p>to resettle refugees/asylum-seekers entering Turkey from </p><p>Iraq.  MFA confirmed the GOT intends to set up 12 camps </p><p>(Humanitarian Assistance Collection Zones ) HACZs) inside </p><p>Iraq, and six additional camps in Turkey as a last resort. </p><p>In response to a question from the U.S. delegation, Sensoy </p><p>stated that the 12 camps in Iraq would be located 45 to 50 </p><p>kilometers away from the Turkish border, unless Turkey is not </p><p>part of the military coalition.  In that case, the camps </p><p>would be located in the immediate vicinity of the border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Sensoy said the GOT plans to assist up to 138,000 to </p><p>170,000 displaced persons (DPs).  This will utilize about 60 </p><p>percent of the Turk Red Crescent (TRC) resources.  TRC will </p><p>hold back other 40 percent for domestic natural disaster </p><p>contingencies.  TRC may dip into these stocks if it receives </p><p>guarantees of replenishment from IFRC or another source. </p><p>Note:  The GOT has said it is planning the capacity to </p><p>provide for 276,000 DPs.  Sensoy,s figure of 170,000, which </p><p>is just over 60 percent of 276,000, probably corresponds to </p><p>TRC,s need to reserve 40 percent of capacity.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) NGO Access:  NGOs seeking to assist in the HACZs </p><p>must apply to MFA and sign an MOU defining their activities </p><p>with the GOT.  Sensoy emphasized that MFA would be </p><p>&selective8 with respect to security concerns in vetting </p><p>NGOs.  NGOs intending to cross the frontier to provide goods </p><p>and assistance in Iraq beyond Turkey,s camps must apply to </p><p>MFA, but will not need to sign an MOU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Northern Iraq Relief Mandate:  Dewey laid down the </p><p>marker that the ICRC and UNHCR would have the mandate for </p><p>relief activity on the Iraqi side of the border, and that any </p><p>TRC assistance would have to proceed in coordination with </p><p>those organizations.  Sensoy stated that the GOT would </p><p>coordinate with ICRC and UNHCR, and that it would only build </p><p>camps in northern Iraq if they were needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) HDRs:  Turks Propose Local Procurement:  Collins </p><p>raised longstanding U.S. request to site one million </p><p>humanitarian daily rations (HDRs) in Turkey.  Sensoy </p><p>responded that Turkey had the ability to produce HDRs locally </p><p>and that this would likely be more cost-effective.  The </p><p>Turkish delegation provided a brochure issued by Unifo Food </p><p>Industry and Trading Company describing its Meals Ready to </p><p>Eat (MREs).  He suggested the USG buy Turkish HDRs as part of </p><p>the economic compensation package (which he claimed had not </p><p>been finalized).  Dewey agreed that we would look at this </p><p>possibility, but asked for an answer on our HDR request. </p><p>Note:  MFA subsequently told us orally that they are inclined </p><p>to approve siting of HDRs, but that further intra-GOT </p><p>consultation was required on this issue before the Turks can </p><p>provide a definitive answer.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) WFP Issues:  Dewey raised several potential </p><p>problems facing the WFP\'s plan to supply food via Turkey to </p><p>Iraq.  He noted that WFP planned to import wheat for milling </p><p>in Turkey, and urged that Turkey facilitate this as much as </p><p>possible by reducing bureaucratic formalities and by </p><p>refraining from collection of customs or other duties.  He </p><p>also raised a potential problem with truck standards. </p><p>Finally, Dewey suggested that it might become useful to </p><p>channel WFP supplies through Turkey but using Syrian ports, </p><p>and asked the MFA to consider this.  Sensoy responded that he </p><p>did not foresee customs problems with wheat imports.  Turkey </p><p>had sufficient trucks meeting Turkish standards to carry out </p><p>WFP,s mission.  Sensoy added that he would have to look into </p><p>the question of shipping through Syrian ports.  While Mersin </p><p>and Iskenderun ports are now designated for aid use, Sensoy </p><p>raised the possibility that WFP activities might have to </p><p>shift from either or both ports, if they were needed for </p><p>military use, to other facilities, such as Toros (private </p><p>port). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish General Staff </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) A/S Dewey, accompanied by MCLC Maj. General Osman, </p><p>met with Maj. General Suphi Acar, of the Turkish General </p><p>Staff J5.  Acar seemed reluctant to discuss humanitarian </p><p>planning and Turkish intentions in northern Iraq, and a </p><p>junior MFA representative who was present in the meeting </p><p>repeatedly took the initiative in responding to the U.S. </p><p>delegation.  Acar stated that the Turkish army did not plan </p><p>to go &too deep8 into Iraq, but that its role would be </p><p>limited to protecting the Turcoman and fighting terrorists. </p><p>He added that TGS would like to coordinate with the USG on </p><p>humanitarian assistance and more generally on its presence in </p><p>northern Iraq.  A/S Dewey emphasized that the USG will </p><p>coordinate its humanitarian assistance through the UN </p><p>agencies and ICRC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) TRC President Ertan Gonen told A/S Dewey that his </p><p>organization was capable of providing blankets, heating, food </p><p>and hygiene kits for 100,000 DPs.  He explained that, if all </p><p>TRC resources were deployed, the organization could handle </p><p>276,000 DPs, but that TRC needed to keep a portion of its </p><p>resources in reserve for domestic contingencies.  Gonen </p><p>acknowledged ICRC,s mandate to provide aid in conflict </p><p>zones, and said that if ICRC lacked resources, TRC stood </p><p>ready to assist.  He maintained that security (e.g. </p><p>terrorism) was Turkey,s greatest concern in connection with </p><p>any DP crisis, based on the experience of 1991.  Gonen also </p><p>said that a protocol with UN agencies might be signed March </p><p>14.  Note:  The protocol has not yet been signed.  End Note. </p><p>Gonen told A/S Dewey that TRC enjoyed close cooperation with </p><p>the American Red Cross, and that U.S. NGO Americare had </p><p>visited TRC recently. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Update on UN Agencies, Contingency Planning </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The U.S. delegation met over lunch with members of UN </p><p>Turkey,s country team, led by Resident Coordinator Alfredo </p><p>Witschi-Cestari.  Andre LaPerriere, UNICEF Northern Iraq </p><p>Erbil Office Coordinator, Jean-Marie Fakhouri, UNHCR Regional </p><p>Coordinator for the Iraq Situation, and Amin Awad, UNHCR </p><p>Deputy Regional Coordinator for the Iraq Situation, also </p><p>participated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Coordination:  Witschi-Cestari told the delegation </p><p>that the UN is concerned about security, and that it asked </p><p>U.S. military not to site its offices (possible Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance Coordination Center ) HACC) in Dyarbakir in the </p><p>same building now housing UN emergency offices.  Dewey </p><p>described his proposal to set up a civilian coordination </p><p>mechanism including the GOT, UN agencies and the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) UNICEF on Northern Iraq:  LaPerriere said that </p><p>UNICEF had developed a plan for northern Iraq that sought to </p><p>make each of the three governorates self-sustaining in the </p><p>event of a disruption in the supply chain.  He noted that the </p><p>Syrian route may be a problem as the GOS has been insisting </p><p>on a fee of USD 400 per truck for transit.  In northern Iraq, </p><p>there are five sites for prepositioned supplies (medicine, </p><p>blankets, winter clothes, water purification equipment). </p><p>LaPerriere said that the estimated displacement in the north </p><p>was likely to amount to about 250,000 persons, with the </p><p>greatest problems in Zakho and Mosul.  He estimated that </p><p>about 40 percent of these DPs could be absorbed by local </p><p>families.   Shelter, fuel, and water are now the chief </p><p>concerns, though the Iranians may be able to supply some </p><p>fuel.  UNICEF said that each governorate in N. Iraq has an </p><p>emergency committee and they have worked with UNICEF to train </p><p>people for emergency response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) LaPerriere emphasized Kurdish hostility to Turkish </p><p>intervention in the region, opining that the Kurds in </p><p>northern Iraq would prefer to be subject to the Baghdad </p><p>regime than to the Turks.  He stated the Turks are in fact </p><p>building some camps in northern Iraq, and that some appeared </p><p>to be completed, but UN staff were denied access to them. </p><p>(See also septel on USAID/DART meeting with LaPerriere.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) World Food Program Issues in Turkey:  WFP Emergency </p><p>Coordinator John Murray stated that WFP\'s registration in </p><p>Turkey lapsed in the 1990,s and that WFP was experiencing </p><p>significant delays in its attempt to reregister.  However, </p><p>WFP has been able to operate effectively in Turkey under UNDP </p><p>cover.  Murray said that WFP planned to import wheat flour, </p><p>rather than wheat, in the first two months following </p><p>disruption of the OFF Program.  WFP inquired with the Turkish </p><p>Grain Board about procuring wheat locally, but it has not </p><p>received a response from the agency.  Murray said that there </p><p>may be tax consequences for WFP if it mills wheat in Turkey. </p><p>He also noted the intermittent closure of the Turkish-Iraqi </p><p>border to WFP trucks, and said that only 28 of its 41 trucks </p><p>had made it across. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) Kirkuk/Mosul:  In a follow up meeting on March 13, </p><p>Jean-Marie Fakhouri, UNHCR Regional Coordinator for the Iraq </p><p>Situation, Amin Awad, UNHCR Deputy Regional Coordinator for </p><p>the Iraq Situation, told A/S Dewey that the return of </p><p>primarily Kurdish displaced persons to Kirkuk and Mosul could </p><p>spark conflict.  Fakhouri said that available information </p><p>indicated that some 100,000 to 200,000 DPs have made </p><p>preparations and are poised to move quickly.  He asked the </p><p>USG to provide advance warning of those movements if at all </p><p>possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) UN Responsibilities in Iraq:  On the UN plan to give </p><p>the UN Office of Project Services (UN OPS) protection </p><p>responsibilities for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in </p><p>northern Iraq and IOM responsibility for the center and </p><p>south, Fakhouri expressed some skepticism that these agencies </p><p>were prepared for these duties.  (In his meeting with the </p><p>previous day, Witschi-Cestari shared the same concerns about </p><p>IOM and UN Habitat.  Habitat would have responsibility to </p><p>provide some shelter for IDPs.  Neither UN OPS nor UN Habitat </p><p>has extensive experience as an emergency responder.  IOM has </p><p>no international staff inside Iraq, and will have to rely on </p><p>local agents to implement their mandate to protect IDPs.) </p><p>Fakhouri said that UNHCR has been focused on its mission to </p><p>provide assistance and protection in neighboring countries </p><p>and along Iraq,s borders to refugees and displaced persons, </p><p>but it is not well prepared to deal with DPs in Iraq and </p><p>would prefer to work through the ICRC there.  Nonetheless, he </p><p>noted that the Secretary General may task UNHCR to redirect </p><p>its aid from the borders to IDPs within Iraq.  Fakhouri also </p><p>expressed concern about restarting the OFF Program during and </p><p>after the conflict, noting that it would take about 8 weeks </p><p>for the UN WFP to take over the program from the GOI.  WFP,s </p><p>planned 120,000 tons per month of food rations are a fraction </p><p>of the current 500,000 tons imported and not all households </p><p>have laid aside food reserves.  Food shortages are possible </p><p>before the OFF is fully operational again.  Fakhouri pointed </p><p>to the potential for terrorist activity in Kuwait, which </p><p>could launch an unexpected movement of persons within Kuwait </p><p>and from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IFRC on Turkish Red Crescent, ICRC Relations with the GOT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) A/S Dewey met with Carl Naucler, Head of </p><p>Delegation, International Federation of Red Cross and Red </p><p>Crescent Societies (IFRC), on March 13 to discuss TRC,s role </p><p>in providing humanitarian assistance in northern Iraq, and </p><p>the International Committee of the Red Cross, (ICRC,) </p><p>relations with the GOT.  Naucler told us that IFRC had </p><p>pressed TRC President Gonen not to cross into northern Iraq </p><p>to provide aid in violation of the rules and principles of </p><p>the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, but opined that TRC </p><p>could be &pushed8 into northern Iraq by the GOT. </p><p>23. (SBU) Naucler said the ICRC had sent a letter to TRC </p><p>explaining that a TRC presence in Iraq would be fully legal </p><p>only under the following circumstances:  as a uniformed </p><p>auxiliary to the Turkish armed forces responsible only for </p><p>medical support; with the consent of the Iraqi Red Crescent </p><p>(which he noted is completely hostile to a TRC presence in </p><p>Iraq); or in coordination with the ICRC.  The letter reminded </p><p>TRC that, even with ICRC permission, TRC would merely have </p><p>the status of a &Participating National Society8 and could </p><p>be one of several national societies authorized to provide </p><p>relief.  According to Naucler, TRC,s written reply </p><p>acknowledged the requirement to coordinate with the ICRC, but </p><p>said it would do so when IFRC provided logistical support, </p><p>implying that TRC did not fully understand or accept ICRC,s </p><p>lead role.  Naucler has suggested to Gonen that he get in </p><p>touch with ICRC to discuss TRC,s possible role in providing </p><p>aid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (SBU) Naucler told Dewey that IFRC would not support TRC </p><p>activities in northern Iraq unless it obtains a clear mandate </p><p>to operate there, although he hinted that IFRC could show </p><p>flexibility if TRC operated close to the frontier and if the </p><p>circumstances (difficult terrain, lack of alternatives) </p><p>required TRC to respond on Iraqi rather than Turkish </p><p>territory.  He said IFRC would primarily have a </p><p>monitoring/reporting role for other donors with respect to </p><p>TRC, and might also deploy several media and logistical </p><p>specialists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. (SBU) ICRC Status:  Naucler told us that the GOT agreed </p><p>to ICRC,s request to open a temporary office in Turkey, but </p><p>imposed a number of conditions that would make it impossible </p><p>for ICRC to fulfill its mandate.  He said that ICRC would </p><p>post someone to Turkey during a possible conflict in Iraq, </p><p>with or without formal status from the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. (SBU) TRC Preparedness:  According to Naucler, TRC staff </p><p>are prepared and well-trained to cope with disasters, but he </p><p>fears that they are susceptible to Turkish military </p><p>interference.  He said TRC has not moved supplies into </p><p>northern Iraq, but has stockpiled goods in Silopi. </p><p>Naucler,s deputy, who is in Silopi, reported that some of </p><p>the camp locations on Turkish territory are now under two </p><p>meters of snow and are not suitable locations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. (SBU) IFRC also criticized the TRC,s/GOT,s </p><p>uncoordinated appeal for relief supplies.  Naucler noted that </p><p>the Turks had requested tents from NATO to shelter 276,000 </p><p>persons, and had also requested supplies from other donors </p><p>(septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KDP/PUK on Possible Turkish Military Intervention, Appeal for </p><p>Humanitarian Supplies </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28. (C) Safeen Diyazee, Ankara Representative, Kurdistan </p><p>Democratic Party, and Bahros Galali, Ankara Representative, </p><p>Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, expressed concern about </p><p>possible Turkish intervention in northern Iraq and outlined </p><p>their humanitarian contingency planning.   Galali noted that </p><p>the Turks cite Kurdish designs on Kirkuk and Mosul as a </p><p>rationale for Turkish military intervention.  However, he </p><p>emphasized that some 250,000 displaced Kurds are only seeking </p><p>return to their homes, that the KDP and PUK do not oppose the </p><p>return of Iraqis of Arab, Turkmen and other ethnic origin to </p><p>their homes in Kirkuk and Mosul, and that the oil resources </p><p>of this region belong to all the people of Iraq.  Diyazee </p><p>told Dewey that the Turks were using humanitarian concern as </p><p>a pretext for intervention, and that there would be no wave </p><p>of displaced persons from the PUK and KDP regions.  He added </p><p>that Turkish intervention was an unnecessary distraction from </p><p>the war against Baghdad.  Based on their contacts with senior </p><p>Iraqi military officers, Dizayee does believe the Iraqi army </p><p>would destroy the oilfields in Kirkuk and Mosul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. (SBU) Dizayee said that the KDP had developed extensive </p><p>contingency plans for humanitarian assistance and that these </p><p>had been shared with USAID and the Humanitarian Planning </p><p>Team, but emphasized that resources were urgently needed. </p><p>KDP has identified potential camp locations for displaced </p><p>persons from central Iraq as well as for Iraqi POWs and </p><p>defectors.  Dizayee pointed out that Baghdad has blocked some </p><p>supplies (particularly food and fuel) for northern Iraq under </p><p>the OFF Program, and that the north has thus not been able to </p><p>build stocks in preparation for a possible conflict.  He </p><p>added that non-emergency medical treatment was being deferred </p><p>to conserve medicine.  Dizayee stated that Peace Wind, a </p><p>Japanese NGO, had pledged USD 2.6 million in assistance in </p><p>the event of a crisis.  He said KDP had provided an inventory </p><p>of needed relief materials to USAID and said he expected help </p><p>in filling those gaps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment/Recommendation </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>30. (C) Embassy will follow up with MFA and resident UN </p><p>agencies to secure agreement to the proposed humanitarian </p><p>coordination mechanism and to storing HDRs in Turkey, but the </p><p>GOT may not formally respond and go on a crisis footing until </p><p>and unless hostilities in Iraq begin.  Fakhouri,s comment </p><p>that delays in restarting the OFF under WFP management could </p><p>leave the Iraqi population short of food is worrisome and we </p><p>would encourage Washington agencies to address the issue on </p><p>an urgent basis. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
