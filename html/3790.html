A MAN </p><p>WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS NGUYEN VAN DUNG, DEPUTY CHIEF OF </p><p>POLITICAL SECURITY, LED THE OPERATION AND DID MOST OF THE </p><p>TALKING FOR THE NEXT FOUR HOURS.  UPON ARRIVAL, DUNG </p><p>FLASHED AN OFFICIAL LOOKING DOCUMENT AND DEMANDED THAT QUE </p><p>ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE POLICE STATION.  CITING ILL HEALTH AND </p><p>THE LACK OF A VALID LEGAL DOCUMENT ALLEGING SPECIFIC </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF VIETNAMESE LAW, QUE REFUSED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) DEPUTY CHIEF DUNG ACCUSED DR.

AFTER ATTEMPTING </p><p>TO PRESSURE QUE\'S WIFE AND TWO ADULT SONS TO CONVINCE HIM </p><p>TO GIVE IN, DEPUTY CHIEF DUNG AND COMPANY FINALLY DEPARTED, </p><p>LEAVING SEVERAL OFFICERS BEHIND.

(SBU) DR. QUE REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZED THAT HE HAD NO IDEA </p><p>WHAT MIGHT HAVE TRIGGERED THIS SUDDEN BURST OF INTEREST </p><p>FROM THE AUTHORITIES.  ONE POSSIBILITY HE MENTIONED, </p><p>HOWEVER, WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTING A VISIT </p><p>FROM PHIL FISHMAN AND TIM RYAN OF THE AFL-CIO.  BUT THEY </p><p>HAD NOT ACTUALLY MADE CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE </p><p>QUE\'S PHONE SERVICE HAD BEEN INTERMITTENTLY CUT OFF.  AS </p><p>POLOFF WAS LEAVING, QUE SAID THAT HE HAD RECENTLY RECEIVED </p><p>A LAPTOP COMPUTER FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF </p><p>SCIENCES AND ASKED IF THE CONSULATE GENERAL COULD ASSIST </p><p>HIM IN CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET.

QUE HAS RECEIVED </p><p>CONGENOFFS AND OTHER AMERICAN VISITORS FAIRLY REGULARLY. </p><p>WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PHONE SERVICE CUTOFFS, HE HAS NOT </p><p>COMPLAINED TO US OF SPECIFIC POLICE HARASSMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2388 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HO CHI  00966  02 OF 02  240817Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    JUSE-00  L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /008W </p><p>                  ------------------EBD9C5  240817Z /38 </p><p>R 240812Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6825 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000966 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00966  02 OF 02  240817Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
