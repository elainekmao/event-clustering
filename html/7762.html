<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000955 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN,S ELECTION:  CITIZENS BET ON DEMOCRACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  The April 27 parliamentary election </p><p>demonstrated significant progress in Yemen\'s democratic path </p><p>despite some flaws.  Obvious enthusiasm and interest by </p><p>voters in the campaign, including more than 75% turnout on </p><p>election day, indicate a healthy appetite for democracy in </p><p>Yemen.  The preliminary results contain little change, with </p><p>the ruling party maintaining a wide majority of more than 70% </p><p>of the seats.  The Islah party, however, made surprising </p><p>gains in the urban city of Sanaa.  In a region with a noted </p><p>lack of healthy democratic trends, this exercise in democracy </p><p>represents an important example.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Progress on the Road to Democracy </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Yemen,s third parliamentary election since </p><p>unification represents another milestone in movement towards </p><p>full democracy despite flaws in its election and political </p><p>processes, as noted by the National Democratic Institute </p><p>(NDI) and other political observers (see paragraph 10 below). </p><p> The campaign period saw a palpable sense of enthusiasm and </p><p>participation, culminating in a huge turnout of 76% of </p><p>registered voters on election day.  With a 40% increase in </p><p>women registered to vote over the last registration, massive </p><p>numbers of women exercised their right to freely choose their </p><p>representatives.  As NDI reports, citizens\' "deepening sense </p><p>of democratic entitlement is an important indication of </p><p>Yemen,s progress. . ." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  President Saleh played a constructive and important </p><p>role in encouraging the democratic process.  His comments at </p><p>several press conferences before and during the election made </p><p>several key points that were important for the peaceful </p><p>nature of election day and for setting the tone of democratic </p><p>rights.  He said on April 27, "we have to accept defeat or </p><p>victory with a democratic spirit."  Election day was </p><p>relatively peaceful compared to past elections, owing in part </p><p>to the prominence placed on a "weapons free day."  He also </p><p>made a comparison to Iraq, saying that he did not want </p><p>"99.9%" of the vote for the ruling party, and noted that a </p><p>strong democratic showing would ensure that Yemen was safe </p><p>from actions similar to what happened in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Results Show Little Change; </p><p>Islah Gains in Urban Areas </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The Supreme Commission for Elections and Referenda </p><p>(SCER) announced official results on April 30, under the </p><p>72-hour deadline mandated by election law.  Out of 301 </p><p>constituencies, final results are known in 280 while 21 </p><p>remain under dispute.  The ruling General People\'s Congress </p><p>(GPC) garnered an overwhelming majority with 214 seats so </p><p>far, more than 70%.  The opposition Islah party gained 40 </p><p>seats (13%), the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) 7 seats (2%), </p><p>and independents and smaller parties 19 seats.  One woman of </p><p>the 11 female candidates won, marking a decrease from the </p><p>last parliament, which had two women. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The SCER did not give specific details about the </p><p>problems holding up the disputed constituencies but noted </p><p>that some might require by-elections.  Observers note that </p><p>these constituencies face problems such as counting </p><p>commissioners who refuse to complete the count and stolen </p><p>ballot boxes. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Many observers were surprised that the opposition </p><p>parties, particularly Islah, did not do better in the </p><p>election.  During the campaign, it appeared that the </p><p>opposition parties would increase their seats, particularly </p><p>Islah.  However, only in Sanaa city did Islah make noticeable </p><p>gains, increasing their number from one to over half of the </p><p>constituencies.  This result in a major urban area surprised </p><p>many because Islah\'s strongholds tend to be in traditional </p><p>tribal areas.  Some observers were shocked as well that the </p><p>Islah won in what is called the "unity constituency," where </p><p>President Saleh votes and where his son last held the seat. </p><p>While difficult to confirm, some observers believe that fraud </p><p>and political intimidation did effect the outcome of the </p><p>election in GPC\'s favor in some constituencies outside of </p><p>Sanaa. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Political observers believe that Islah\'s gains in </p><p>Sanaa were a result of dissatisfaction with the government, </p><p>Islah\'s message of change resonating with voters, a </p><p>well-organized campaign and poor GPC candidate selection. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Campaign Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  "Bread and butter" issues dominated the election, </p><p>with economic and law and order issues prevalent. </p><p>Anti-corruption and anti-government messages were popular </p><p>among opposition parties.  Although observers had thought </p><p>that the war in Iraq and ongoing U.S.-Yemeni counterterrorism </p><p>cooperation would become big issues, the fall of Baghdad </p><p>three weeks before election day largely diminished the issue. </p><p> As one Yemeni observer said, "when people are hungry, they </p><p>don\'t care about foreign policy." </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>9.  (U)  While far from perfect, these elections demonstrated </p><p>an entrenchment of political rights by Yemeni citizens that </p><p>sets an example for future democratic trends in the region. </p><p>The flaws in the process must be vigorously addressed before </p><p>the next election in 2006, with the help of the international </p><p>community, to avoid backsliding in Yemen\'s democratic </p><p>progress. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>NDI Report:  Significant Step Forward Despite Flaws </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  As NDI described in its preliminary statement on </p><p>April 29, both positive and negative developments </p><p>characterized the elections.  The full report, with specific </p><p>examples and anecdotal evidence, was sent to NEA/ARP and is </p><p>also available at www.ndi.org.  The positive developments </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p>-- a relatively peaceful election, with fewer injuries and </p><p>deaths due to violent clashes than in previous elections; </p><p> </p><p>-- full participation by all major political parties allowing </p><p>for increased competition and a further entrenchment of the </p><p>multi-party system; </p><p> </p><p>-- a well-administered and organized balloting process on </p><p>election day; </p><p> </p><p>-- significant professional improvements by the Supreme </p><p>Commission for Elections and Referenda (SCER); </p><p> </p><p>-- close and constructive cooperation between international </p><p>actors, including NDI, International Foundation for Electoral </p><p>Systems (IFES) and the UN Development Program (UNDP), and the </p><p>SCER, resulting in significant administrative and political </p><p>improvements. </p><p> </p><p>Despite many positive developments, significant flaws remain </p><p>that must be addressed vigorously in future election </p><p>processes, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- evidence of election law violations, primarily but not </p><p>exclusively by the GPC, including political intimidation, </p><p>underage voting, inappropriate behavior by security forces </p><p>and vote buying on election day; </p><p> </p><p>-- obstruction by counting commissioners that has caused the </p><p>results of more than 20 constituencies to go unannounced 72 </p><p>hours after the end of voting, calling into question the </p><p>credibility of results in these areas. </p><p> </p><p>For example, </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
