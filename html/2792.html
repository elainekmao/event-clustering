HANOI 3601 (1999)  B. HANOI 1755 (1999) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: THE SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE 22,000-STRONG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00400  01 OF 02  190630Z </p><p>FULL GOSPEL ASSEMBLIES OF GOD (AOG) IN VIETNAM SAID HE WOULD </p><p>WELCOME GOVERNMENT RECOGNITION OF THE GROUP, BUT EXPECTED IT </p><p>TO REMAIN AN "UNDERGROUND ORGANIZATION" FOR YEARS TO COME. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT STILL "REPRESSES" THE AOG, HE CLAIMED, BUT NO </p><p>LONGER IMPRISONS AOG BELIEVERS OR PASTORS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>"SOPHISTICATED REPRESSION" IN THE NORTH </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) REVEREND DUONG THANH LAM, GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT </p><p>FOR THE FULL GOSPEL ASSEMBLIES OF GOD (AOG) IN VIETNAM MET </p><p>WITH POLOFF ON APRIL 15, THE FIRST CONTACT MISSION HAS HAD </p><p>WITH THE AOG LEADER.  [NOTE: MISSION\'S ONLY PREVIOUS CONTACT </p><p>WITH THE AOG OCCURRED WHEN POLICE DETAINED REVEREND TRAN </p><p>DINH "PAUL" AI IN MID-1999 FOR TAKING PART IN A BIBLE </p><p>MEETING IN HANOI.  MISSION LATER ASSISTED AI IN OBTAINING A </p><p>RELIGIOUS WORKER (R) VISA, WHICH HE AND HIS FAMILY USED TO </p><p>TRAVEL TO THE U.S. IN DECEMBER 1999 (SEE REFTELS).] </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) LAM SAID HE HAS SERVED AS AOG GENERAL </p><p>SUPERINTENDENT SINCE 1997.  HE STATED THAT HE HAS ONLY 30 </p><p>PASTORS (10 OF WHOM ARE ORDAINED, THE OTHER 20 FULLY TRAINED </p><p>BUT NOT YET ORDAINED) TO MINISTER TO 22,000 AOG FOLLOWERS IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  HE SAID THE RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF AOG </p><p>FOLLOWERS (COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 800,000 PROTESTANT </p><p>BELIEVERS NATIONWIDE) WAS DUE TO SEVERE REPRESSION OF THE </p><p>AOG AFTER 1975.  HE SAID THE CHURCH REORGANIZED ITSELF IN </p><p>1989, AND HAS SINCE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY.  MOST OF THE </p><p>GROUP\'S 225 HOUSE CHURCHES ARE IN HCMC.  THE NEXT LARGEST </p><p>CONCENTRATION OF AOG WORSHIPPERS IS AMONG THE K\'HO AND EDE </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS IN LAM DONG AND DAK LAK PROVINCES IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF THAI, H\'MONG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00400  01 OF 02  190630Z </p><p>AND OTHER ETHNIC MINORITY PERSONS PARTICIPATE IN AOG HOUSE </p><p>CHURCH SERVICES IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES BORDERING CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) LAM SAID HIS GROUP FACES ITS SEVEREST PERSECUTION </p><p>IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES.  HE SINGLED OUT LAI CHAU AND LANG </p><p>SON PROVINCES AS THE MOST REPRESSIVE.  IN SOME VILLAGES IN </p><p>LAI CHAU, LAM ASSERTED, NON-UNIFORMED SECURITY PERSONNEL </p><p>STAY IN CHRISTIAN HOMES TO PREVENT THEM FROM CARRYING OUT </p><p>WORSHIP SERVICES.  POLICE SUMMON FOR QUESTIONING PERSONS </p><p>SUSPECTED OF ORGANIZING HOUSE CHURCH SERVICES ON AN ALMOST </p><p>DAILY BASIS.  DISTRICT OFFICIALS ALLEGEDLY ORGANIZE MEETINGS </p><p>WHERE AOG FOLLOWERS ARE COERCED INTO SIGNING DOCUMENTS </p><p>PLEDGING TO ABANDON CHRISTIANITY.  LAM MENTIONED THAT THOSE </p><p>WHO RENOUNCE THEIR FAITH SOMETIMES DRINK ANIMAL BLOOD, BUT </p><p>NOTED THIS IS A COMMON PRACTICE AMONG CERTAIN ETHNIC GROUPS. </p><p>THE ACT IN THIS CONTEXT DEMONSTRATES A RETURN TO TRADITIONAL </p><p>BELIEFS AND PRACTICES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) LAM GAVE POLOFF A COPY OF A DOCUMENT PURPORTEDLY </p><p>USED FOR RENUNCIATION IN DIEN BIEN PHU IN LAI CHAU PROVINCE. </p><p>THE SIGNATORY AGREES TO FIVE CONDITIONS, THE THIRD OF WHICH </p><p>TRANSLATES AS FOLLOWS: "WE WILL NOT FOLLOW ANY RELIGION, WE </p><p>WILL NOT READ THE BIBLE, WE WILL NOT SING RELIGIOUS SONGS, </p><p>AND WE WILL NOT GATHER IN A GROUP TO PRAY WITHOUT THE </p><p>PERMISSION OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES."  ACCORDING TO LAM, </p><p>SINCE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES NEVER GIVE PERMISSION, </p><p>SIGNING THE DOCUMENT AMOUNTS TO A RENUNCIATION OF FAITH. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) LAM SAID THAT UNTIL TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, POLICE </p><p>IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES OFTEN BEAT OR IMPRISONED AOG </p><p>PASTORS AND BELIEVERS, BUT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO AOG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00400  01 OF 02  190630Z </p><p>PASTORS OR BELIEVERS IMPRISONED.  OFFICIALS USE "OTHER MEANS </p><p>OF INTIMIDATION."  HOUSEHOLDERS WHO REFUSE TO RECANT THEIR </p><p>FAITH MAY LOSE THEIR JOBS, OR THEIR CHILDREN MAY BE </p><p>FORBIDDEN TO ATTEND SCHOOL.  THEY MAY HAVE THEIR PROPERTY </p><p>CONFISCATED, OR BE OSTRACIZED IN THEIR OWN VILLAGE.  LAM </p><p>WORRIED THAT THIS "SOPHISTICATED REPRESSION" WAS MORE </p><p>EFFECTIVE THAN PHYSICAL ABUSE OR IMPRISONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MORE TOLERANCE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) LAM SAID CONDITIONS FOR ETHNIC MINORITY AOG </p><p>BELIEVERS HAVE IMPROVED IN THE LAM DONG AND DAK LAK </p><p>PROVINCES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, SINCE THE ETHNIC UNREST </p><p>LAST FEBRUARY.  MANY H\'MONG FAMILIES FROM LANG SON PROVINCE </p><p>IN THE NORTH HAVE MIGRATED TO DAK LAK.  LAM ADMITTED </p><p>ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY WAS A STRONG MAGNET FOR MIGRATION, BUT </p><p>INSISTED GREATER RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE WAS ALSO AN IMPORTANT </p><p>REASON FOR MOVING TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  OTHER </p><p>PROTESTANT CONTACTS HAVE NOTED THAT H\'MONG AND OTHER </p><p>NORTHERN ETHNIC MINORITIES, WHO HAVE MIGRATED TO DAK LAK, </p><p>LAM DONG AND BINH PHUOC PROVINCES, SAY THEY FACE LESS </p><p>RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THAN THEY DID IN THE NORTH. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) BUT THE AOG ALSO FACES PROBLEMS IN THE FAR SOUTH. </p><p>LAM CLAIMED THAT DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL, TIEN GIANG </p><p>PROVINCE IN THE MEKONG DELTA BROADCAST A TELEVISION SPOT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00400  02 OF 02  190631Z </p><p>THAT CALLED THE AOG A "COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY RELIGION OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES," AND CALLED ON PEOPLE TO REPORT AOG MEMBERS </p><p>OR ACTIVITIES TO THE AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>NO LEGAL STATUS ANYTIME SOON </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>9. (SBU) LAM ASSERTED THAT THE AOG WOULD NEVER REGISTER WITH </p><p>THE NEWLY RECOGNIZED SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM </p><p>BECAUSE OF DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCES.  HE WOULD WELCOME SEPARATE </p><p>LEGAL RECOGNITION, BUT ONLY IF THE GVN ALLOWED THE AOG TO </p><p>FUNCTION FREE OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL AND CENSORSHIP.  SINCE </p><p>THIS IS NOT LIKELY, HE SAID HE EXPECTED THE AOG TO REMAIN AN </p><p>"UNDERGROUND ORGANIZATION" FOR YEARS TO COME. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) ALONG WITH OTHER "CHARISMATIC" DENOMINATIONS, THE </p><p>AOG ACTIVELY EVANGELIZES IN VIETNAM.  THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL </p><p>NUMBERS DO NOT REFLECT THE VIGOR WITH WHICH THEY SEEK NEW </p><p>CONVERTS, ESPECIALLY AMONG ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS.  THEY ARE </p><p>THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT WITHIN VIETNAM\'S PROTESTANT </p><p>COMMUNITY, WHICH MAY ALSO EXPLAIN WHY AUTHORITIES IN VIETNAM </p><p>-- WHERE PROSELYTIZING IS ILLEGAL -- ARE WARY AND MONITOR </p><p>THEM CLOSELY. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
