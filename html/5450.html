Bush </p><p>President of the United States of America </p><p> </p><p>Greetings: </p><p> </p><p>Subject: Urgent Appeal by Families of Kuwait POWs </p><p>"Salvaging Kuwait POWs and Hostages in Iraq...At The Last </p><p>Moment" </p><p> </p><p>We, families and relatives of Kuwait POWs in Iraq, extend to </p><p>you our highest thanks and gratitude for the cooperation and </p><p>support you have shown towards the top issue of Kuwait\'s </p><p>government and people ) the Kuwait POWs issue, and we </p><p>congratulate you on the advent of the New Year and wish you </p><p>many happy and healthy returns of the occasion. </p><p> </p><p>Your Excellency: </p><p> </p><p>We, families of the POWs, have doubts that the issue of our </p><p>sons the POWs gets the concern it deserves despite its deep </p><p>humanitarian dimensions. It is a thorny issue and its </p><p>progress over the past twelve years was slow and </p><p>unsatisfactory for us and for all Kuwaitis.  As you know, </p><p>Your Excellency, within the context of this ongoing campaign </p><p>against the Iraqi regime, the souls of our sons the POWs </p><p>would undoubtedly be in danger and they would be under the </p><p>mercy of the thorny circumstances in the event of launching </p><p>any military attack on Iraq, which has become the most likely </p><p>scenario for the coalition countries led by the United States </p><p>of America. </p><p> </p><p>As you know, Your Excellency, the issue of Kuwait POWs </p><p>figures high on and tops the priorities of the agendas of </p><p>meetings of the official Kuwaiti delegations, be they </p><p>governmental or popular. The international charters, notably </p><p>the UN Human Rights Charter, impose on countries respect for </p><p>human rights, particularly the civilian prisoners during the </p><p>period of captivity. </p><p> </p><p>Your Excellency: </p><p> </p><p>The United States is in the process of completing its </p><p>leadership for defeating terror wherever it is, and it is in </p><p>the process of striking the terror of the Iraqi regime soon </p><p>) if it does not comply with the international charters ) </p><p>as has been declared. It is not ruled out that the troops of </p><p>the Iraqi regime would take revenge on the Kuwait POWs </p><p>languishing in Iraqi prisons under the harsh circumstances of </p><p>captivity, which have undoubtedly weakened their powers and </p><p>frustrated their determination. Therefore, we hereby </p><p>underscore the significance of safeguarding the safety of </p><p>Kuwait POWs in Iraqi prisons during and after directing the </p><p>military blow at Iraq. We appeal to Your Excellency to lay </p><p>down a humanitarian emergency plan, as we have been </p><p>accustomed to see you do in such cases, for the protection of </p><p>the souls of our POWs and to transport them to safe places in </p><p>the event of the potential military strike, especially with </p><p>the supposition of the revenge by the Iraqi regime upon them, </p><p>based on response to the aggression and getting rid of the </p><p>problem. </p><p> </p><p>Based on the love and appreciation the Kuwaiti people harbor </p><p>for your country and people, we would like to affirm to Your </p><p>Excellency, our support for your constructive role as a </p><p>pioneering state, leading the campaign for eliminating terror </p><p>and enmity to rights of states and human rights. Our </p><p>confidence in the role of the United States of America in </p><p>putting an end to this ordeal is not but in completion of the </p><p>pioneering role undertaken by your father in the liberation </p><p>of Kuwait and recovering the rights of its people in the year </p><p>1991. We are certain that our sons the POWs have lived on </p><p>this hope over the past twelve years and we hope that your </p><p>wise leadership would not disregard this appeal. </p><p> </p><p>We hope that this appeal would receive your support and </p><p>sympathy with the tragedy of the people of Kuwait and the </p><p>affliction of the families of Kuwait POWs. We thank Your </p><p>Excellency for being generous enough to respond to us and </p><p>keep us posted of developments relating to our sons the POWs. </p><p> </p><p>For A Group of Relatives of Kuwait POWs </p><p>Dr. Fatima Khadhir Al-Abdali </p><p>Fax No. (965) 561-6412 </p><p>Or (965) 398-3614 </p><p>Tel.
