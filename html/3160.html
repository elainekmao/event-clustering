<p>S E C R E T KATHMANDU 001201 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PM/CPP AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL REQUEST FOR MILITARY INFORMATION SUPPORT </p><p>TEAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 22974 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: MAJ PETE FOWLER, ODC. REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Embassy Kathmandu requests Military </p><p>Information Support Team (MIST) to assist the RNA in </p><p>planning information strategies, developing PSYOP </p><p>campaigns and programs.  Embassy Kathmandu sees a three </p><p>to four man element training the Royal Nepalese Army </p><p>for up to four months. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/REL NP) The Government of Nepal (GON) has been </p><p>combating a serious Maoist insurgency for the last six </p><p>years.  Recently, the level of violence has increased </p><p>to the point that the Royal Nepalese Army has been </p><p>deployed nation-wide.  As of 26 NOV 01 the GON has </p><p>declared a state of emergency in response to the </p><p>growing Maoist problem.  Counter-insurgency (COIN) </p><p>operations are new territory for the RNA.  Recently, in </p><p>APR 02, PACOM conducted an assessment of the RNA to </p><p>include their PSYOP capability.  The RNA organized a </p><p>PSYOP section for the first time just six months ago </p><p>and is conducting a limited PSYOP campaign focusing on </p><p>counter-propaganda. However, the PSYOP section requires </p><p>training assistance in the following areas: development </p><p>of an information strategy, identifying target </p><p>audiences and their vulnerabilities, media distribution </p><p>methods, and campaign effectiveness assessment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NOFORN) Specific objectives: </p><p> a.  Assist and advise the RNA in developing a national </p><p>information strategy; </p><p> b.  Assist the RNA in PSYOP theme development, target </p><p>audience analysis, and media distribution; </p><p> c.  Expand awareness of human rights; </p><p> d.  Enhance awareness of the military\'s responsibility </p><p>to serve civil society; </p><p> e.  Support the necessity of free and fair elections </p><p>in a democratic society; </p><p> f.  Expand awareness of government development </p><p>projects; and </p><p> g.  Expand awareness of Maoist human rights atrocities </p><p>and infrastructure destruction </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  This is a unique opportunity for Special </p><p>Operation Forces soldiers to build from scratch a PSYOP </p><p>capability for a nation which desperately needs </p><p>information warfare skills.  The RNA is a professional </p><p>force that is doing a lot with very little, but so is </p><p>their foe.  The MIST\'s efforts would be greatly </p><p>appreciated by the GON, RNA, people of Nepal, and the </p><p>country team. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
