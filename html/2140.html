THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" DEDICATED </p><p>   ITS NOVEMBER 3 EDITORIAL TO THE RECENT DEFAULT JUDGEMENT </p><p>   AGAINST PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE ISSUED BY AN U.S. </p><p>   FEDERAL COURT.  THE RULING THAT PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE, </p><p>   IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE FIRST SECRETARY OF THE RULING </p><p>   ZANU-PF PARTY, IS LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RELATED TO </p><p>   POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE WAS NOT WELL RECEIVED BY </p><p>   THE PAPER.    UNDER HEADLINE "U. S. COURT\'S RULING </p><p>   DEFIES LOGIC," THE PAPER COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "THE RECENTLY PASSED U. S. FEDERAL COURT\'S RULING </p><p>   DECLARING THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE CAN BE SUED IN THAT </p><p>   COUNTRY AS THE FIRST SECRETARY OF ZANU PF, DEFIES ALL </p><p>   LOGIC AND IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF AMERICAN ARROGANCE </p><p>   TOWARDS THE REST OF THE WORLD. . .  BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT </p><p>   THE MEANING OF JUSTICE AND FAIR PLAY HAS A DIFFERENT </p><p>   INTERPRETATION IN AMERICA TO THAT OF THE REST OF THE </p><p>   WORLD.  OTHERWISE, WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD WOULD A </p><p>   LEARNED JUDGE PASS SUCH JUDGEMENT WITHOUT GIVING </p><p>   AUDIENCE TO THE OTHER PARTY?  ANY PROPERLY CONSTITUTED </p><p>   COURT WITH THE DESIRE TO UPHOLD THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE </p><p>   WOULD, BEFORE HEARING SUCH A CASE, EQUIP ITSELF WITH </p><p>   UNBIASED EVIDENCE OF THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND ON THE </p><p>   GIVEN COUNTRY. . .  IN THIS CASE IT SEEMS THE PRESIDING </p><p>   JUDGE ALREADY HAD A PRECONCEIVED IDEA ABOUT ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>   SAW IT FIT TO DISREGARD THE RULES OF JUSTICE.  DESPITE </p><p>   THE LAID-DOWN RULES, THE U. S. COURT ISSUED A DEFAULT </p><p>   JUDGEMENT AGAINST ZANU PF WITHOUT ENSURING THAT THE </p><p>   RESPONDENT HAD BEEN PROPERLY SERVED. . .  THEREFORE, </p><p>   SINCE IT IS QUITE APPARENT THAT SERVICE WAS NOT PROPERLY </p><p>   EFFECTED, THE COURT SHOULD HAVE REFUSED THE HEAR THE </p><p>   MATTER. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03301  051421Z </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
