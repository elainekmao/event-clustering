<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000796 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: EXPORTS REMAIN STRONG, BUT LIRA WORRIES PERSIST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: New figures released by the Turkish </p><p>Exporters Assembly (TIM) on June 2 show that Turkey\'s </p><p>exporters withstood the challenge of a strengthening lira and </p><p>set a new monthly export record of USD 3.9 billion in May, a </p><p>30.7 percent increase over 2002.  For the year ending May 31, </p><p>exports were USD 40.7 billion, up 28 percent from the </p><p>previous 12 month period.  Meanwhile, however, declining </p><p>tourism revenues and an even sharper pickup in imports led </p><p>the GOT to revise its 2003 current account deficit projection </p><p>from USD 3.7 billion to 6.1 billion.  Exporters warned too </p><p>that the appreciating lira threatens their competitiveness </p><p>and added their voice to calls on the Central Bank for a </p><p>decline in interest rates and more consistent exchange rate </p><p>policy.  Central Bank officials counter that continued low </p><p>unit labor costs and productivity increases are keeping </p><p>Turkish exports competitive, and that exporters are focusing </p><p>excessively on the lira-dollar rate, which--for trade </p><p>purposes--is much less important than the lira-Euro rate, </p><p>where the lira\'s appreciation has been much smaller.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) A new record: The statistics unveiled June 2 in </p><p>Istanbul show Turkish exports moving from record to record, </p><p>with April\'s USD 3.74 billion giving way to May\'s 3.916 </p><p>billion, despite the lira\'s appreciation.  For the first five </p><p>months of the year exports were USD 17.9 billion (versus </p><p>13.36 billion in the same period last year), while for the </p><p>last twelve months they totalled USD 40.7 billion.  The </p><p>record was paced by sharp gains in exports of textiles (up </p><p>28.6 percent to USD 993 million) and automotive products (up </p><p>48.4 percent to USD 596 million). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) But a widening deficit: Even with the export record, </p><p>however, the GOT also moved on June 2 to revise Turkey\'s </p><p>projected 2003 current account deficit up to USD 6.1 billion. </p><p> While projected exports were revised up to 40.6 billion from </p><p>39.4 billion, even more quickly growing imports and a </p><p>projected decline in tourism revenues (though of a lesser </p><p>magnitude than was predicted earlier in the year) account for </p><p>the widening gap.  In announcing the shift, State Minister </p><p>Babacan also pointed to the impact of the strong lira and </p><p>what he characterized as strong private sector demand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Statistical Anomolies: While a welcome and positive </p><p>development, commentators argue that the headline export </p><p>figure is not necessarily as impressive as it first appears. </p><p>Given that the bulk of Turkey\'s exports (nearly 66 percent) </p><p>goes to the European Union and is priced in Euros, "Sabah\'s" </p><p>Abdurrahman Yildirim noted, a portion of the January-May </p><p>increase (perhaps as much as a quarter by our rough </p><p>calculations) stems from the Euro\'s increase in value against </p><p>the dollar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Shoals Ahead: In announcing the May figures, TIM </p><p>Chairman Oguz Satici warned that notwithstanding the positive </p><p>results of the last five months, export growth is becoming </p><p>unsustainable because of the appreciating lira.  May\'s </p><p>figures, he said, reflect orders placed in the first three </p><p>months of the year, while currently exporters are coming to a </p><p>situation where they "cannot accept orders" because the </p><p>appreciating exchange rate does not permit them to accurately </p><p>predict costs and income, and consequently prices.  Arguing </p><p>that the current rate serves the interests of "rentiers" and </p><p>not the real economy, he called for an exchange rate "in the </p><p>same line as inflation and input costs," and warned the </p><p>Central Bank that "those who avoid responsibility even though </p><p>they have authority will be called to account." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: Central Bank officials question exporters\' </p><p>arguments.  First, they point out that, while the lira-dollar </p><p>exchange rate is important in financial markets, the </p><p>lira-Euro rate is much more significant for trade.  Although </p><p>the lira has appreciated against the Euro, its rise has been </p><p>much more modest than against the dollar.  Furthermore, </p><p>imported inputs for exports tend to be priced in dollar </p><p>terms, so the lira\'s appreciation against the dollar is not a </p><p>complete negative for exporters.  In addition, these </p><p>officials point out, Turkish exporters continue to benefit </p><p>from low unit labor costs, which still have not recovered </p><p>from the 2001 crisis, and from rising productivity.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
