<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 003057 </p><p> </p><p>JEDDAH FOR STEINGER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/12/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ECON, LE, IR, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: BERRI ON HIZBALLAH, THE REGION AND THE ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. BEIRUT 3002 </p><p>     B. BEIRUT 2965 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM CAROL R. KALIN.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  IN DISCUSSING HIZBALLAH\'S SIGNIFICANCE WITH </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR DECEMBER 7, SPEAKER BERRI SAID THAT AMAL WAS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL "ACTIONS" PRIOR TO ISRAEL\'S 1984 </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM BEIRUT.  HE PREDICTED THAT HIZBALLAH WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO LAUNCH CROSS-BORDER ATTACKS UNTIL A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>PEACE WAS REACHED.  BERRI ARGUED THAT ARAFAT WAS TOO WEAK TO </p><p>COMBAT TERRORISM, AND WARNED OF CIVIL WAR AMONG THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  ON THE ECONOMY, BERRI CLAIMED THAT HE DID NOT </p><p>OPPOSE PRIVATIZATION, BUT WOULD USE HIS ROLE AS SPEAKER TO </p><p>INFLUENCE THE PRIORITIZATION OF ECONOMIC REFORM MEASURES. </p><p>BERRI THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS DECEMBER 3 TOUR OF SOUTH </p><p>LEBANON FOCUSED ON DEMINING ISSUES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) HIZBALLAH\'S ROLE:  DURING A DECEMBER 7 MEETING WITH </p><p>SPEAKER NABIH BERRI, AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY LEBANON DESK </p><p>OFFICER TIM POUNDS AND POLOFF, SOLICITED BERRI\'S VIEW ON </p><p>WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT HIZBALLAH MAY BE REASSESSING ITS </p><p>TACTICS.  BERRI SAID THAT THE PATH HIZBALLAH CHOOSES WOULD </p><p>DEPEND ON THE COURSE OF U.S.-IRANIAN RELATIONS. RECALLING </p><p>HIZBALLAH SYG\'S DECEMBER 1 REMARKS THAT SHEBA\' FARMS WERE NOT </p><p>THE ONLY OCCUPIED LEBANESE TERRITORY (REF A), BERRI PREDICTED </p><p>THAT THERE WOULD BE NO END TO CROSS-BORDER ATTACKS UNTIL </p><p>THERE WAS A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AGREEMENT.  HE ASSERTED THAT </p><p>"THE ISSUE IS WITH THE SYRIANS," AND GIVEN SYRIA\'S INFLUENCE </p><p>IN LEBANON, THEIR "BROTHERLY RELATIONS" AND THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES\' REJECTION OF SEPARATE PEACE AGREEMENTS, A </p><p>CESSATION OF ATTACKS WAS UNLIKELY.  BERRI SAID THAT ISRAEL </p><p>HAS INFLATED HIZBALLAH\'S STANDING BY CREDITING IT WITH ACTS </p><p>COMMITTED BY AMAL OR OTHER GROUPS.  BERRI VOLUNTEERED THAT </p><p>AMAL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL "ACTIONS" PRIOR TO THE 1984 </p><p>ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM BEIRUT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BERRI NOTED THAT THE TRADITIONAL RIVALRY BETWEEN </p><p>HIZBALLAH AND AMAL HAS STRENGTHENED THE GOL\'S ROLE IN THE </p><p>SOUTH.  FOLLOWING ISRAEL\'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE SOUTH, HE </p><p>SAID, THE TWO GROUPS AGREED THAT THEY WOULD LEAVE SECURITY </p><p>ISSUES TO GOL AUTHORITIES, IN ORDER TO AVOID OPEN CONFLICT </p><p>BETWEEN THEM.  AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS ARRANGEMENT, HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE ISF HAD BEEN THE ORGANIZATION TO RESPOND TO A RECENT </p><p>INCIDENT IN MARJAYOUN IN WHICH A FORMER SLA MEMBER WAS </p><p>ATTACKED. HE ALSO CITED THE ISF\'S ROLE IN ENSURING SMOOTH </p><p>MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) REGIONAL VIOLENCE:  THE AMBASSADOR UPDATED BERRI ON </p><p>SPECIAL ENVOY ZINNI\'S WORK IN THE REGION, AND A/S BURNS\' </p><p>PLANS TO VISIT BEIRUT ON DECEMBER 14. BERRI SAID THAT HE DOES </p><p>NOT BELIEVE SHARON WANTS PEACE.  THE AMBASSADOR ARGUED THAT </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO A SERIES OF SIGNIFICANT U.S. MOVES ON THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS AND THE DISPATCH OF ZINNI AND BURNS TO THE </p><p>REGION, PALESTINIANS HAD LAUNCHED A SERIES OF TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS.  BERRI ACCEPTED THE AMBASSADOR\'S POINT, BUT WARNED </p><p>THAT ARAFAT WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN FACING A CIVIL WAR OR A WAR </p><p>WITH ISRAEL.  ARAFAT IS WEAK, HE SAID, AND DOES NOT HAVE THE </p><p>ABILITY TO DO MORE.   "IF WE END UP WITH HAMAS AND SHARON, IT </p><p>WILL BE A DISASTER,"  HE SAID.  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT </p><p>ARAB LEADERS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT ARAFAT AND </p><p>ENCOURAGE HIS COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE ECONOMY:  TURNING TO THE ECONOMY, BERRI CLAIMED </p><p>THAT ALTHOUGH HE FAVORS PRIVATIZATION, AS A TACTICAL MOVE, HE </p><p>WAS HOLDING UP PRIVATIZATION OF TELECOMMS UNTIL THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MOVED AHEAD ON THE MOST COSTLY SECTORS, SUCH AS </p><p>THE ELECTRICAL UTILITY, EDL.  HOWEVER, BEFORE PRIVATIZATION </p><p>OF EDL BEGAN, BERRI ADDED, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD FIRST </p><p>COLLECT THE THOUSANDS OF UNPAID ELECTRICAL BILLS.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT REALIZED AN ANNUAL INTAKE OF $400 MILLION FROM </p><p>TELEPHONE LANDLINES, SO ITS PRIVATIZATION WAS NOT AN URGENT </p><p>MATTER, AND BERRI SAID THAT HE HAD ALREADY AGREED TO THE </p><p>PRIVATIZATION OF THE CELL-PHONE NETWORK. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) BERRI V. HARIRI:  BERRI SAID THAT HE WOULD WORK WITH </p><p>HARIRI ON ECONOMIC ITEMS WHEN IT WAS IN THE INTEREST OF THE </p><p>BUDGET, BUT NOT WHEN HARIRI WAS "BEING LAZY." FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>BERRI SAID, HE HAD RAILROADED THE VAT LAW THROUGH PARLIAMENT </p><p>AS A PACKAGE, CONTRARY TO HIS USUAL PRACTICE OF VOTING ON </p><p>EACH ARTICLE SEPARATELY, BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IT WAS AN </p><p>IMPORTANT STEP.  HOWEVER, HE WOULD FIGHT HARIRI ON THE </p><p>REDUCTION OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE SOUTH\'S BUDGET.  BERRI SAID </p><p>THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED A 25 PERCENT REDUCTION, BUT HARIRI HAD </p><p>TRIED TO SLASH THE BUDGET BY 40 PERCENT.  BECAUSE PARLIAMENT </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO INCREASE ALLOCATIONS, ONLY TO CUT </p><p>THEM, BERRI SAID THAT HE HAD THREATENED TO RETALIATE AGAINST </p><p>HARIRI BY CUTTING IN AREAS DEAR TO HARIRI.  BERRI SAID THAT </p><p>THE FORMER ISRAELI-CONTROLLED AREA NEEDED SIGNIFICANT </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE RECONSTRUCTION OF </p><p>10,000 HOMES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DEMINING:  THE AMBASSADOR BRIEFED BERRI ON HIS TRIP </p><p>THROUGH SOUTH LEBANON DECEMBER 3 FOCUSED ON DEMINING ISSUES </p><p>(REF B).  SUCH OPERATIONS, HE NOTED, IN ADDITION TO BEING A </p><p>HUMANITARIAN IMPERATIVE, WERE CRUCIAL TO THE ECONOMIC </p><p>REVITALIZATION OF SOUTHERN LEBANON.  BERRI THANKED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR FOR MAKING THE TRIP, SAYING HE HAD FOLLOWED THE </p><p>EVENTS CLOSELY. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: BERRI\'S CLAIM TO ALL "ACTIONS" UNTIL 1984, </p><p>LIKELY INTENDED AS A THROW-AWAY TO MINIMIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE </p><p>OF AMAL\'S RIVAL HIZBALLAH ON THE LEBANESE SCENE, IS </p><p>STARTLING, AND IT IS UNLIKELY IF ASKED AGAIN THAT HE WOULD </p><p>CONFIRM AMAL\'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>U.S. FACILITIES.  BERRI\'S INFLUENCE HAS ALWAYS DEPENDED ON </p><p>HIS ABILITY TO OFFER PATRONAGE TO HIS SUPPORTERS.  HIS </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE AN ECONOMIC RATIONALE ON BLATANT ATTEMPTS </p><p>TO KEEP AS MANY JOBS FOR HIS RETAINERS FOR AS LONG AS </p><p>POSSIBLE ARE UNCONVINCING AND THE INSISTENCE ON EDL BILL </p><p>COLLECTIONS RUN CONTARY TO HIS OWN POLITICAL INTERESTS, SINCE </p><p>MOST OF THE UNCOLLECTED FEES ARE AMONG HIS CONSTITUENTS.  HIS </p><p>SUPPORT IS CRUCIAL, HOWEVER, TO THE ADOPTION OF LEGISLATION, </p><p>AS HE MAINTAINS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>PROCESS. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BATTLE </p><p></p></div>
