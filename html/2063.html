REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2239 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ESCAPED INJURY ON OCTOBER 12 AFTER HIS CONVOY WAS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ATTACKED BY STONE-THROWING ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS.  TWO WINDOWS IN HIS </p><p>VEHICLE WERE SHATTERED AND THE VEHICLE\'S BODY WAS DAMAGED.  POLICE </p><p>WERE UNHELPFUL AND FAILED TO ARREST OR CHARGE ANY OF THE </p><p>PERPETRATORS.  THE ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS APPEARED TO HAVE PRIOR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONVOY\'S ROUTE AND TIMING.  IN AN UNRELATED </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, FOUR MDC MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WERE ON OCTOBER 13 </p><p>TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED FROM THE PARTY\'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE PENDING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR ROLE IN FACTIONAL </p><p>DISPUTES SIMMERING FOR ALMOST A MONTH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ATTACK ON TSVANGIRAI </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON OCTOBER 12, THE VEHICLE IN WHICH MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WAS RIDING WAS </p><p>ATTACKED BY A STONE-THROWING MOB.  MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN </p><p>NCUBE, TOLD US THAT TSVANGIRAI HAD BEEN ON HIS WAY TO ADDRESS </p><p>PARTY OFFICIALS IN SANYATI, SEVERAL HUNDRED KILOMETERS WEST OF </p><p>HARARE, WHEN APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY YOUTHS EMERGED FROM THE BUSHES </p><p>AND BLOCKED THE ROAD.  THEY THREW STONES AND STICKS, SHATTERING </p><p>TWO WINDOWS IN TSVANGIRAI\'S VEHICLE, INCLUDING THE ONE IN THE REAR </p><p>NEXT TO THE SEAT IN WHICH THE OPPOSITION LEADER WAS SITTING.  TWO </p><p>STONES LANDED IN THE BACKSEAT BESIDE TSVANGIRAI.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03062  01 OF 02  151553Z </p><p>NCUBE, THE MOB DISPERSED AFTER A BODYGUARD IN THE SECOND CAR FIRED </p><p>A PISTOL IN THE AIR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE CONVOY SPED TO THE NEAREST POLICE STATION, IN KADOMA, </p><p>TO REPORT THE INCIDENT.  NCUBE TOLD US THAT THE POLICE APPEARED </p><p>COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT AND ONLY SEEMED INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT </p><p>WHO HAD DISCHARGED THE PISTOL.  NONE OF THE MDC REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>HAD MENTIONED THAT A SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED, AND THUS THEY ASSUMED </p><p>THAT THE POLICE HAD WITNESSED WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE.  NONE OF THE </p><p>PERPETRATORS HAS BEEN DETAINED OR CHARGED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) FORTUNATELY, NEITHER TSVANGIRAI NOR ANYONE ACCOMPANYING </p><p>HIM WAS HURT.  WHEN POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ASKED WHETHER THE MDC </p><p>CONSIDERED THIS AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, TSVANGIRAI\'S SPECIAL </p><p>ADVISOR GANDI MUDZINGWA REFUSED TO RULE IT OUT AS A POSSIBILITY. </p><p>"ANYTIME YOU SEND 75 PEOPLE TO THROW STONES THROUGH A CAR WINDOW, </p><p>YOU CANNOT GUARANTEE WHAT THE RESULT WILL BE," MUDZINGWA SAID. </p><p>"FATALITIES COULD OCCUR."  HE POINTED OUT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO </p><p>CONTROL A STONE-THROWING MOB ONCE IT IS UNLEASHED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE OCTOBER 12 INCIDENT IS THE SECOND ATTACK ON A </p><p>TSVANGIRAI CONVOY IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS -- THE FIRST OCCURRED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>JULY 22 IN BINDURA (REFTEL).  THE TACTICS USED IN BOTH INCIDENTS </p><p>WERE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL, WITH AMBUSHES CARRIED OUT IN ISOLATED </p><p>LOCATIONS ALONG RURAL STRETCHES OF ROAD, WHILE TSVANGIRAI WAS </p><p>TRAVELLING TO PUBLICLY ADVERTISED MEETINGS.  THE CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>SUGGEST SOME DEGREE OF PLANNING BY THE ASSAILANTS.  WHILE THIS </p><p>APPEARED TO BE CONTINUED INTIMIDATION, THE OCTOBER 12 ATTACK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03062  01 OF 02  151553Z </p><p>CLEARLY COULD HAVE KILLED TSVANGIRAI, AN OUTCOME WHICH WOULD HAVE </p><p>SPARKED SERIOUS UNREST.  AT A MINIMUM, BOTH ATTACKS ARE CONSISTENT </p><p>WITH THE PATTERN DURING THE PAST YEAR-AND-A-HALF OF GOVERNMENT- </p><p>SANCTIONED VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AIMED AT THE MDC LEADERSHIP </p><p>AND PARTY SUPPORTERS.  AFFORDING SOME DEGREE OF DEFENSIVE </p><p>PROTECTION TO TSVANGIRAI AS HE TRAVELS ABOUT THE COUNTRY IS HIGHLY </p><p>DESIRABLE. </p><p> </p><p>MDC OFFICIALS SUSPENDED </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) MEANWHILE, IN AN UNRELATED DEVELOPMENT, FOUR MDC MEMBERS </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT WERE ON OCTOBER 13 SUSPENDED FROM THE PARTY\'S </p><p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE PENDING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR </p><p>ROLE IN FACTIONAL DISPUTES SIMMERING FOR ALMOST A MONTH.  THE </p><p>SUSPENDED MPS INCLUDE LEARNMORE JONGWE, PARTY SPOKESMAN; JOB </p><p>SIKHALA, SECRETARY FOR SECURITY; TAPIWA MASHAKADA, THE SHADOW </p><p>MINISTER OF FINANCE; AND TAFADZWA MUSEKIWA.  WELSHMAN NCUBE TOLD </p><p>JOURNALISTS THAT THE MDC\'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE HAD DECIDED TO </p><p>TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE FOUR, ALONG WITH THE PARTY\'S PROVINCIAL </p><p>CHAIRMAN IN THE TOWN OF CHITUNGWIZA -- ALEX MUSUNDIRE -- UNTIL A </p><p>SPECIAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY HAD CONCLUDED ITS WORK.

THEIR SUPPORTERS DISRUPTED THE SEPTEMBER 16 ELECTION OF A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03062  02 OF 02  151554Z </p><p>NEW PARTY EXECUTIVE FOR HARARE PROVINCE, FORCING A POSTPONEMENT OF </p><p>THE VOTE, AND CLASHED WITH EACH OTHER IN THE HARARE HIGH-DENSITY </p><p>SUBURB OF ST. MARY\'S.  IN ADDITION, SIKHALA LEAKED TO THE PRESS A </p><p>LETTER HE WROTE TO TSVANGIRAI DEMANDING MASHAKADA\'S EXPULSION FROM </p><p>THE PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WELSHMAN NCUBE TOLD US ON OCTOBER 15 THAT THE MDC\'S </p><p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE WAS NOT HAPPY THAT THE FOUR MPS HAD CHOSEN TO </p><p>AIR THEIR GRIEVANCES IN PUBLIC WITHOUT SEEKING SOME SORT OF </p><p>RESOLUTION WITHIN THE PARTY.  NCUBE CONFIDED HIS SUSPICION THAT </p><p>THESE INCIDENTS ARE PARTLY THE RESULT OF AN ENERGETIC OPERATION BY </p><p>THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO) TO DESTABILIZE THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY FROM WITHIN.  THE MDC LEADERSHIP, HE CONTINUED, </p><p>SUSPECTS THAT ONE OF THE FOUR SUSPENDED OFFICIALS IS A KEY </p><p>OPERATIVE IN THIS CIO CAMPAIGN.  GANDI MUDZINGWA TOLD US THAT HE </p><p>DOUBTED THAT THIS SITUATION WOULD INFLICT LASTING DAMAGE ON THE </p><p>MDC, SO LONG AS THE PARTY ACTED DECISIVELY AGAINST THOSE INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) NCUBE\'S CONCERN ABOUT CIO ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY THE MDC FROM </p><p>WITHIN IS WELL-FOUNDED, AS THE INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION HAS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY -- AND SUCCESSFULLY -- PURSUED THIS APPROACH WITH OTHER </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTIES.  THE CIO THEORY, HOWEVER, EXPLAINS ONLY PART </p><p>OF THE CURRENT SITUATION.  SIKHALA AND MASHAKADA ARE ALSO YOUNG, </p><p>AMBITIOUS POLITICIANS ATTEMPTING TO SETTLE PERSONAL SCORES AS THEY </p><p>JOCKEY AGAINST ONE ANOTHER FOR ADDITIONAL INFLUENCE WITHIN THE </p><p>PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ALTHOUGH THE SIKHALA-MASHAKADA DISPUTE IS FAR FROM A FATAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03062  02 OF 02  151554Z </p><p>BLOW TO THE MDC, IT IS AN IMPORTANT TEST OF THE PARTY LEADERSHIP\'S </p><p>CAPACITY TO RESOLVE INTERNAL CONFLICTS.  THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>MDC WHO HAVE NOT APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT A PARTY CAN BE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC BUT STILL INSIST THAT MEMBERS BE DISCIPLINED AND </p><p>RESPECT PARTY POLICIES AND PROTOCOL.  THE MDC LEADERSHIP HAS, </p><p>UNTIL NOW, BEEN RELUCTANT TO MOVE AGAINST MEMBERS WHO FLOUTED </p><p>IMPORTANT PARTY POSITIONS, OUT OF FEAR THAT IT WOULD BE PORTRAYED </p><p>AS INTOLERANT OR ANTI-DEMOCRATIC.  THE COMMISSION OF INQUIRY </p><p>PROVIDES A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO REIN IN WAYWARD MEMBERS AND TO SEND </p><p>A STRONG MESSAGE ABOUT HOW THE PARTY WILL HANDLE SIMILAR PROBLEMS </p><p>IN THE FUTURE.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA </p><p>HAVE HAD A FIELD DAY PORTRAYING THE MDC AS A PARTY IN CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
