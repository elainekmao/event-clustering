<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001902 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, PGOV, ASEC, NP, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: AMCIT CLIMBERS DISCUSS SHOOTING INCIDENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1877 </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  On September 20, American climbers David Morton and </p><p>Jeff Lamoureaux were fired upon by two men wearing what they </p><p>believe were Chinese military uniforms and one of whom stated </p><p>that he belonged to the Chinese military (ref).  Altitude </p><p>readings taken by the climbers and landmarks near their </p><p>location on the approach to Nangpa-La (aka Khumbu-La) make it </p><p>clear that the Americans were in Nepal.  Reftel gives a basic </p><p>chronology of the event; additional details below were </p><p>related by the climbers in a September 30 meeting with </p><p>EmbOffs following the trekkers\' return to Kathmandu.  Draft </p><p>press guidance on the incident, on an if-asked basis, follows </p><p>in para 9. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>POSSIBLY CHINESE MILITARY; </p><p>DEFINITELY IN NEPAL </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Post received a copy of an e-mail on September 24, </p><p>describing a September 20 incident in which two unidentified </p><p>men fired on two AmCit climbers near Nepal\'s border with the </p><p>Tibet Autonomous Region.  Neither American was injured in the </p><p>incident (ref).  In order to clarify details of the report, </p><p>post asked the climbers involved, David Morton and Jeff </p><p>Lamoureaux, to meet with Embassy officers on their return to </p><p>Kathmandu. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  In a September 30 meeting, the climbers confirmed </p><p>to EmbOffs that they had just passed 5100 m (16,725 feet) </p><p>altitude on the route north to Nangpa-La when they first </p><p>encountered one of the shooters.  The climbers had checked </p><p>their altimeter and noted that they were at the same altitude </p><p>as their base camp farther to the east.  That altitude would </p><p>place them 600 m (1960 feet) lower than the pass and </p><p>therefore still in Nepal. (Note: Nangpa-La is just south of </p><p>the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region. End </p><p>note.)  Though the area is extremely remote, with few </p><p>landmarks, the climbers were able to pinpoint the location of </p><p>the first encounter as south of and below Luang, a collection </p><p>of yak-herders\' huts approximately 12 km south of the border. </p><p> The climbers stated that they had "just rounded the corner," </p><p>meaning that they had just passed the outcropping of the </p><p>closest peak that blocks the view of Nangpa-La from below. </p><p>They turned around at Luang and headed back south when they </p><p>spotted a second man watching them from above.  They say they </p><p>were shot at during their descent. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  The two AmCits offered further information about </p><p>the (purported) identity of the assailants.  They say that </p><p>the man who initially stopped them showed them his camouflage </p><p>uniform with a red stripe/epaulette and yellow star on the </p><p>shoulder, and had a red balaclava-type hat with a yellow or </p><p>orange border at the bottom.  The climbers said that the man </p><p>looked "like the Han Chinese you see in Tibet... </p><p>light-skinned with short hair," and that he told the </p><p>Americans he was a member of the Chinese military.  They also </p><p>stated that the man carried an automatic weapon with a curved </p><p>clip and thin metal stock.  They informed him that they were </p><p>Americans prior to the shooting, to which he said nothing. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  The climbers told EmbOffs that when they were </p><p>returning with police protection to their base camp to </p><p>retrieve their climbing gear, they encountered a group of </p><p>Tibetan traders near Luang.  When asked if they had seen any </p><p>Chinese police around the area, the traders replied that they </p><p>had just passed two of them about a kilometer up the trail, </p><p>near the yak-herders\' huts at Luang.  (Note:  Morton and </p><p>Lamoureaux state that the Tibetan traders and their </p><p>translator were using the terms "police," "military" and </p><p>"border patrol" interchangeably during the exchange. End </p><p>note.)  According to the American climbers, the traders did </p><p>not seem surprised by the possible presence of Chinese forces </p><p>inside Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>REFUGEES ON THE TRAIL </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  On their descent to Namche Bazar, where they hoped </p><p>to be able to communicate with Kathmandu, Morton and </p><p>Lamoureaux encountered a lone Tibetan refugee suffering from </p><p>hypothermia.  One of the local guides accompanying the </p><p>climbers spoke Tibetan, and translated the refugee\'s </p><p>statements that he had been traveling with a group of 30-40 </p><p>others but had been left behind because he was moving too </p><p>slowly.  After his group had moved on, the lone refugee had </p><p>heard gunfire and fighting ahead of him on the trail.  In </p><p>Namche Bazar, the District Chief of Police confirmed to the </p><p>climbers that a group of 35 Tibetan refugees had crossed into </p><p>Nepal on the morning of the incident. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>ISOLATED INCIDENT SURPRISING TO MOST </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  This is the first incidence of shooting on Nepal\'s </p><p>border with China in two years, and the first we have heard </p><p>of involving AmCits.  Office of Tibet Representative Wangchuk </p><p>Tsering indicated to PolOff that there have been no shootings </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>on the Chinese border since October 2000, when one refugee </p><p>was killed and two others injured by the Nepal police.  The </p><p>incident does not bear the typical marks of either banditry </p><p>or a Maoist encounter.  The two climbers were never asked for </p><p>their money, their packs, or any of the expensive climbing </p><p>equipment or cameras they had with them.  Maoist insurgents </p><p>are not typically found at the high altitude where the </p><p>incident took place.  Mountaineering professionals were </p><p>surprised by the story, and could not recall any prior events </p><p>of this kind involving trekkers. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  The commander of Royal Nepal Army forces in Namche </p><p>Bazar was also stunned by the news according to Morton and </p><p>Lamoureaux.  The men stated that the Major in charge of the </p><p>local forces initially tried to convince them that they must </p><p>have crossed the border into China before the incident </p><p>occurred, but became "clearly very concerned" when he </p><p>realized where the incident had actually taken place. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>SUGGESTED PRESS GUIDANCE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  On September 30 PD FSN was contacted by CNN, </p><p>requesting further information about the incident.  Given the </p><p>possibility of media coverage, post has drafted the following </p><p>press guidance on an if-asked basis: </p><p> </p><p>Q: (IF ASKED)  What can you tell us about the two American </p><p>trekkers who were shot at by two (purported) members of the </p><p>Chinese military? </p><p> </p><p>A: </p><p>  - The safety of U.S. citizens is of great concern to us. </p><p> </p><p>  - Two private American citizen climbers informed our </p><p>Embassy that on September 20 they were shot at by two </p><p>unidentified  individuals in an extremely remote, mountainous </p><p>area about 12 km from Nepal\'s border with the Tibet </p><p>Autonomous Region. </p><p> </p><p>  - Our Embassy officers have talked to the two American </p><p>citizens involved, who were unharmed in the incident. </p><p> </p><p>  - Our Embassy has raised the matter with the Government of </p><p>Nepal and asked for its assistance in resolving the matter. </p><p> </p><p>  - Our Embassy will continue to gather more information on </p><p>this highly unusual incident and pursue its successful </p><p>resolution. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) We believe the shooting incident is an unfortunate </p><p>anomaly.  The circumstances of the encounter are unlikely to </p><p>affect any other American citizens.  Post has raised this </p><p>issue with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on two separate </p><p>occasions, and will address it again with the Inspector </p><p>General of Police in a meeting on October 1.  We will </p><p>continue to pursue a resolution of the matter with the </p><p>concerned authorities. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
