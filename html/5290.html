Peace talks remain elusive with conflicting reports </p><p>about backchannel Government-Maoist communications.  The </p><p>Government of Nepal has said it will not send a formal </p><p>invitation to the Maoists until they stop their violence, </p><p>while Maoists have warned of severe consequences if talks </p><p>are not held and their student leaders not released.  The </p><p>National Human Rights Commission claimed that the Maoists </p><p>are in regular contact and desire to hold a peace dialogue, </p><p>but only with an all-party interim government.  Maoists are </p><p>taking advantage of isolated areas along the Nepali-India </p><p>border to smuggle contraband into Nepal, while the local </p><p>press has reported that India pledged to set up military </p><p>stations along the border to cope with both Nepali and </p><p>Indian militants.  Victims of the insurgency are planning to </p><p>stage a protest against the Government for its failure to </p><p>provide assistance.  Several human rights groups have </p><p>approached the Government, under fire for refusing a Supreme </p><p>Court order to release several detainees, to improve the </p><p>human rights situation and admit past mistakes. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary continued.  Maoists killed three Armed Police </p><p>Force (APF) personnel in the mid-west, one police officer </p><p>and one Royal Nepal Army (RNA) soldier.  The insurgents </p><p>continued their assaults on civilians, killing six people, </p><p>including an 8-year-old and an 11-year-old child.  Seventeen </p><p>women were abducted by the Maoists in Salyan District for </p><p>"volunteer service," and the Maoists also kidnapped a </p><p>teacher, a Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(CPN-UML) activist, a local social activist, a soldier and a </p><p>female police officer.  Maoists have disrupted postal </p><p>service in Pyuthan District.  People are abandoning their </p><p>jobs and homes in Baglung District because of increased </p><p>pressure from the Maoists.  Schools in the Doti, Accham and </p><p>Bajura Districts are on the verge of closure because </p><p>students and teachers have fled to other parts of Nepal and </p><p>India to avoid the Maoists.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>NO PEACE TALKS FORTHCOMING; MIXED MESSAGES ALL AROUND </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Kuber Sharma, Minister for Tourism, Culture and Civil </p><p>Aviation, told reporters on January 17 that the committee </p><p>formed to facilitate peace talks between the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) and the Maoists has failed to bring about any </p><p>positive results.  Members of the committee, however, claim </p><p>that the committee is in a "progressive phase," and that </p><p>peace talks are at a "confidence building" stage.  Committee </p><p>members refused to elaborate on the new developments, and </p><p>said a deadline could not be placed on when talks would take </p><p>place. Sharma reiterated that the GON would not issue a </p><p>formal invitation to the Maoists unless the Maoists stop </p><p>their violence. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Maoists, meanwhile, issued a warning to the GON, </p><p>conveyed by a former abductee, to hold talks soon or face </p><p>severe consequences.  The insurgents also warned the GON to </p><p>release its student leaders, threatening to send thousands </p><p>of armed students to the capital if the GON did not comply. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Press reports claim that the Maoists are in regular </p><p>contact with members of the National Human Rights Commission </p><p>(NHRC), who said the Maoists are interested in holding peace </p><p>talks, but only with an all-party interim government. </p><p>Conflicting reports, however, cite the Maoists as saying </p><p>they would talk only with the King.  In addition to demands </p><p>for an interim government, the Maoists want assurance that </p><p>they will not be arrested at peace talks.  Nayan Bahadur </p><p>Khatri, Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, </p><p>said the Maoists are to blame for the failed progress in </p><p>peace dialogue.  Khatri cited their lack of sincerity and </p><p>failure to respect human rights as hindrances to the </p><p>resolution of the current crisis. </p><p> </p><p>SMUGGLING ACROSS THE NEPAL-INDIA BORDER </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Isolated areas along the Nepal-India border are </p><p>reportedly becoming hot spots for Maoists, who use the </p><p>terrain to smuggle contraband.  According to local reports, </p><p>gunpowder, explosives, arms and even tobacco and liquor from </p><p>India are being smuggled into Nepal. The post at Koilabus, </p><p>which is only 34 kilometers from the Maoists\' Dang District </p><p>training center, is difficult to reach by vehicle and no </p><p>security personnel have been posted there. </p><p> </p><p>7.  George Fernandes, India\'s Defence Minister, was quoted </p><p>in the local press stating that India would soon set up two </p><p>military stations along the Bihar-Nepal border.  Fernandes </p><p>said the stations were being set up in response to the </p><p>increasing activities of "Nepal\'s Maoist extremists" and </p><p>reports of smuggling.  Fernandes offered that the </p><p>checkpoints would help cope with enemies from the outside as </p><p>well as internal insurgencies. </p><p> </p><p>MURDER AND MAYHEM BY MAOISTS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Three Armed Police Force (APF) personnel were killed and </p><p>eighteen others were injured by a landmine blast in Surkhet </p><p>District on January 23.  The police were on routine patrol </p><p>when the landmine, reportedly planted by Maoists, exploded </p><p>near a bridge.  A two-hour clash between the APF and the </p><p>Maoists followed.  One policeman was killed and several </p><p>others injured when Maoists ambushed a patrol group of 35 </p><p>officers in northwestern Jumla District on January 22.  On </p><p>January 20 a soldier from the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) was </p><p>killed when Maoists detonated a landmine in northeastern </p><p>Solukhumbu District.  In Rupandihi District, two policemen </p><p>were seriously wounded on January 17 when their jeep hit a </p><p>landmine. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Two children, age 8 and 11, were killed in Jumla </p><p>District after playing with a bomb left by Maoists.  Maoists </p><p>reportedly chopped off a student\'s hand before releasing him </p><p>from captivity.  The boy had been abducted from Dang </p><p>District while playing football.  Insurgents severely beat a </p><p>villager in Nuwakot District whom they accused of being a </p><p>polygamist, and also killed two civilians in Khotang </p><p>District, claiming that they had been spying for security </p><p>forces.  A Nepali Congress supporter was beaten to death in </p><p>Dang District on January 23 by a group of Maoists.  The </p><p>insurgents shot and seriously wounded a civilian in </p><p>Sindhupalchowk District on January 17.  The insurgents also </p><p>shot and killed a man on January 15 in Rauthat District </p><p>while he was taking part in a wedding procession. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The insurgency continues to cause hardship in the far </p><p>western hills of Bajura District.  Residents have been left </p><p>without telephone lines after Maoists destroyed </p><p>communication towers.  According to the District Agriculture </p><p>Office, not only has rice output in the district decreased, </p><p>but Maoists are demanding a contribution from families as </p><p>well, leaving limited supplies for families.  Supplies of </p><p>rice from outside areas have been unable to make it into the </p><p>district because of lack of security and looting by Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS CONTINUE ABDUCTIONS OF CIVILIANS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  In Dolakha District, Maoists abducted a soldier </p><p>guarding the Khimti Hydro project on January 17.  A female </p><p>police officer was also abducted by the Maoists from her </p><p>residence on January 19, but was released, unharmed, twenty </p><p>hours later. Seventeen women in Salyan District were taken </p><p>by the Maoists for "volunteer service."  Maoists reportedly </p><p>took one woman from each household and did not tell the </p><p>families where they were being taken.  A high school </p><p>teacher, affiliated with the Nepal National Teachers\' </p><p>Organization, was abducted from his home outside of </p><p>Sankhuwasabha District on January 21 by a group of Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Maoists, once again, targeted associates of the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), </p><p>kidnapping one member in Baglung District on January 21 and </p><p>another District Committee Member in Dhankuta District.  A </p><p>locally prominent, social activist of Nuwakot District was </p><p>taken by Maoists after they stormed into a meeting and </p><p>grabbed him.  His whereabouts are still unknown.  Maoists </p><p>have released the four Communist Party of Nepal-United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) workers abducted a week ago in </p><p>Bhojpur District (ref A).  According to press reports, the </p><p>CPN-UML members were abducted for organizing meetings </p><p>without getting permission from the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Maoists still have not released the five people they </p><p>abducted from the Food For Work Programme (FWP) in Mugu </p><p>District in the far northwest.  Human rights activists have </p><p>demanded their release, saying that the kidnappings are a </p><p>violation of international human rights law. The five have </p><p>been held since December 23. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Eighty students abducted from Salyan District last week </p><p>have been released.  The Maoists had kidnapped the students, </p><p>ages 15 and 16, to train them in guerilla warfare. </p><p> </p><p>INSURGENCY CAUSING JOB AND SCHOOL ABANDONMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  Villagers are fleeing from Baglung District out of fear </p><p>for their safety.  Maoist threats of violence have forced </p><p>almost 100 people to leave their homes and, according to the </p><p>District Administration Office (DAO), the numbers are </p><p>increasing.  Escalating Maoist violence in other districts </p><p>such as Dang, Nepalgunj and Jumla has also caused government </p><p>and non-government workers, teachers and security personnel </p><p>to abandon their jobs as well as their homes.  The Maoists </p><p>have stepped up their campaign of violence against the </p><p>workers for what they see as a lack of assistance.  Many </p><p>have quit their jobs and are fleeing to India. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Government schools in mid-western Nepal are at risk of </p><p>being closed down because of dwindling attendance by </p><p>students and the fleeing of teachers due to the Maoist </p><p>insurgency.  Schools in the Doti, Achham, and Bajura </p><p>Districts have been abandoned by teachers and students. </p><p>Teachers have fled the schools to avoid Maoists who force </p><p>the teachers to donate a percentage of their salary and also </p><p>for safer working conditions.  Maoists have also been </p><p>forcing students to participate in weekly Maoist programs. </p><p>According to reports, over fifty percent of the students </p><p>have also fled to India and other parts of Nepal to avoid </p><p>forced recruitment by the Maoists and harassment by security </p><p>forces. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Postal service is almost non-existent in Pyuthan </p><p>District.  Maoists are harassing postal carriers and have </p><p>destroyed most of the post offices.  Now the insurgents have </p><p>stopped delivery of mail to security personnel as well as </p><p>the local villagers. No one has complained about active </p><p>Maoist censorship of personal mail for fear of retaliation </p><p>by the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>CHALLENGE TO IMPROVE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  The Government of Nepal is under fire for its refusal </p><p>to release several detainees, even after being ordered to do </p><p>so by the Supreme Court of Nepal.  The National Human Rights </p><p>Commission (NHRC) has urged the GON to comply with the order </p><p>and respect basic human rights, declaring in a letter sent </p><p>to Prime Minister Lokendra Chand that it would be </p><p>"ridiculous" if the GON does not obey the order and thus </p><p>encourage "gross violations of human rights."  The four </p><p>detainees are being held under the Terrorist and Destructive </p><p>Activities Act, on suspicions of being Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>19.  Krishna Pahadi, Chairman of the Human Rights and Peace </p><p>Society Nepal, wants the GON to admit human rights abuses in </p><p>other cases and compensate the families who have suffered </p><p>because of the violations.  The request follows the </p><p>admission by the government that the five youths killed by </p><p>the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) Nuwakot on November 27 were </p><p>innocent civilians (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>20.  The Government announced that a human rights cell has </p><p>been established within the Armed Police Force (APF).  The </p><p>cell is headed by a Deputy Inspector General of Police and </p><p>consists of senior police officers.  A similar cell is also </p><p>being formed in the civilian police force. </p><p> </p><p>21.  The National Assembly Social Justice Committee, a </p><p>division of the Upper House of Parliament, called for an </p><p>immediate stop to human rights violations, and has also </p><p>questioned the government over the insufficient supply of </p><p>passports in districts throughout Nepal.  The Committee is </p><p>also seeking clarification pertaining to news reports which </p><p>allege that people injured as a result of operations carried </p><p>out by security forces are being denied medical treatment. </p><p> </p><p>VICTIMS OF MAOIST INSURGENCY PROTEST GOVERNMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>22.  Victims of Maoist atrocities are planning a mass rally </p><p>to protest the Government of Nepal\'s (GON) lack of </p><p>assistance.  The Maoist-Affected Victim\'s Association (MAVA) </p><p>announced that it would stage protests beginning on January </p><p>24 and ending February 12.  MAVA is also planning a sit-in </p><p>in front of Singha Durbar on February 4, hoping to bring </p><p>traffic to a standstill for an hour.  MAVA claims that the </p><p>government has not honored the assistance program promised </p><p>by the Deuba government.  MAVA is demanding an increase in </p><p>financial assistance, medical care, pensions for the widows </p><p>of murdered schoolteachers, and scholarships for the </p><p>children of victims.  Under Prime Minister Chand, MAVA </p><p>claims that financial allowances for the displaced have been </p><p>terminated, medical treatment is limited to only three </p><p>months, and the financial compensation is inadequate. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
