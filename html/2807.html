<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000965 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHALACHTER. AF/RA FOR SWANN, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI </p><p>FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT -- U.S. ACCUSED OF COORDINATING </p><p>TERROR CAMPAIGN IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   The lead story in the April 22 edition of the </p><p>    government-controlled "Chronicle" accuses the </p><p>    opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) of </p><p>    "planning a massive terrorist attack" in Harare and </p><p>    Bulawayo in a move "to invoke civil unrest and pave way </p><p>    for military intervention by Britain and the United </p><p>    States."  The "exclusive" article, based on information </p><p>    from nameless sources and authored by an anonymous </p><p>    "Chronicle Reporter," alleges that the planned </p><p>    "terrorist attack" is being "co-ordinated by a </p><p>    \'political affairs\' officer at the U.S. Embassy." </p><p>    Under headline "Extreme terror!: Buildings to be </p><p>    bombed; March to State House on cards," the paper </p><p>    reports: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "The opposition MDC, is planning a massive </p><p>    terrorist attack that will bring down some tall </p><p>    buildings in Harare and Bulawayo in a series of </p><p>    bombings, as the increasingly desperate opposition </p><p>    party steps up its campaign to fast-track Mr. Morgan </p><p>    Tsvangirai into power by creating a \'crisis,\' Chronicle </p><p>    has learnt.  Sources within MDC\'s national executive </p><p>    said plans are at an advanced stage to start bombing </p><p>    strategic buildings in the major cities to invoke civil </p><p>    unrest and pave way for military intervention by </p><p>    Britain and the U.S.  Targeted are five buildings in </p><p>    Harare and three in Bulawayo and MDC teams were putting </p><p>    \'final touches\' to the terrorist attack being co- </p><p>    ordinated by a \'political affairs\' officer at the U. S. </p><p>    Embassy.  Sources privy to the details of the plan </p><p>    dubbed \'massive economic sabotage\' said the scheme had </p><p>    been unanimously voted for by MDC\'s national executive </p><p>    at their meeting last week." </p><p> </p><p>3.   Comment:  The Bulawayo-based, government-owned </p><p>    "Chronicle" frequently publishes outlandish "news" </p><p>    stories that have no basis in fact.  The paper </p><p>    specializes in bizarre unsigned articles that rely </p><p>    exclusively on anonymous sources.  Current editor </p><p>    Stephen Ndlovu is the third person to hold that </p><p>    position in the last year, and is a protg of </p><p>    Information Minister Jonathan Moyo.  The "Chronicle\'s" </p><p>    circulation has dropped by nearly 50 percent in the 18 </p><p>    months, with current circulation at about 25,000 copies </p><p>    per day.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p>D </p><p></p></div>
