<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000753 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/ARP, AND PRM </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR DCHA/OFDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT WANTS TO PLAY ROLE IN RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) This is an action message:  see paragraph 8. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary: Shaykh Nasser Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, Senior </p><p>Advisor to Crown Prince Shaykh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem </p><p>Al-Sabah and son of Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmed </p><p>Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, recently told Ambassador that Kuwait wants </p><p>to play an active and positive role in the long-term </p><p>reconstruction of Iraq.  In addition to the security benefits </p><p>of building a prosperous and stable state on its northern </p><p>border, Kuwait believes there are significant economic </p><p>rewards to be reaped as well.  He pointed out that creative </p><p>thinking about debts and compensation payments could </p><p>contribute to economic development for all.  Shaykh Nasser </p><p>said he envisioned an Iraq that becomes a model for democracy </p><p>and development to other states in the region, including </p><p>Kuwait.  He requested Embassy assistance in arranging the </p><p>right contacts in the USG to discuss Kuwait\'s vision for the </p><p>region and to coordinate Kuwait\'s role.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  On February 22 and February 28, Ambassador and </p><p>EconChief met with Shaykh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed Al-Sabah. </p><p>Shaykh Nasser spoke at great length about the current and </p><p>future situation in Iraq; he shared his assessment that a </p><p>functioning democracy in Iraq is eminently possible, pointing </p><p>back in history to the "good period" Iraq enjoyed in the </p><p>1920\'s.  He also said the US should not worry extensively </p><p>about Shia\'s striving for independence, and outlined the </p><p>possibilities of a federal system consisting of three states </p><p>(North, Central and South) or 18 Provinces.  However, he </p><p>opined that the first two years will be the most critical </p><p>part of the reconstruction; in any case the basic </p><p>requirements for success would be democracy, development, and </p><p>tolerance. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the 2/22 meeting, Shaykh Nasser told the Ambassador </p><p>that Kuwait wanted to play a significant role in the </p><p>reconstruction of Iraq, and the Ambassador briefed Shaykh </p><p>Nasser on USG deployments of humanitarian relief personnel </p><p>who represent the first wave in our efforts to begin the </p><p>process.  The Ambassador invited Shaykh Nasser to identify a </p><p>GOK representative for our teams to meet with, and Nasser </p><p>agreed to consult with Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmad to identify the </p><p>appropriate interlocutor.  A few days later Nasser called the </p><p>Ambassador to say that Minister of Commerce and Industry </p><p>Salah Al-Khorsheed had been designated, and the Ambassador </p><p>agreed to set up meetings for the appropriate USG personnel </p><p>to meet Khorsheed once they had arrived in Kuwait.  (NOTE: </p><p>Khorsheed is expected to resign his post in the next few </p><p>months in preparation for elections to the National Assembly </p><p>expected later this year. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On 2/28 Shaykh Nasser expanded on his earlier </p><p>thoughts, and reminded Ambassador of their discussions in </p><p>mid-2002 about his "vision" for a rail, sea, and air </p><p>transportation hub (and extending across the Iraqi and Saudi </p><p>deserts all the way to Jordan, as well as across the Shatt </p><p>al-Arab into Iran) where raw materials and labor from China </p><p>and the Far East, Central Asia, and Africa could be combined </p><p>with the capital and energy resources of the Persian Gulf to </p><p>produce intermediate and finished products for Asian and </p><p>European markets.  Nasser said that the reconstruction of </p><p>Iraq could be an excellent opportunity to advance his ideas, </p><p>which he continues to refine and develop.  He again </p><p>reiterated his desire to meet with the appropriate USG </p><p>officials to share his ideas and to see how they could be </p><p>coordinated with USG plans for Iraq\'s reconstruction. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Shaykh Nasser noted that Kuwait has about USD 178 </p><p>billion of compensation claims still before the UN </p><p>Compensation Committee; about USD 115 billion of those </p><p>represented claims of the Kuwaiti Government.  Nasser said </p><p>the government expects to receive about USD 35-40 billion of </p><p>the claimed amount.  He said that the GOK should be inventive </p><p>about collecting the claims, suggesting that Iraqi </p><p>investments in infrastructure development and joint projects </p><p>of interest to the GOK -- building gas, oil and or water </p><p>pipelines, for example -- might be credited against its </p><p>compensation debt to the GOK. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador encouraged Shaykh Nasser to ensure the GOK </p><p>interest in this regard was made public; this could help to </p><p>begin rebuilding goodwill between the Iraqi and Kuwaiti </p><p>peoples, and would facilitate international coordination. </p><p>Nasser agreed with the Ambassador and said he\'d consult with </p><p>the Foreign Minister and the Crown Prince on this point.  The </p><p>Ambassador suggested that it might be desirable to create </p><p>some type of international forum to advance long-term </p><p>projects; EconChief added that such a committee could call </p><p>upon the expertise of IFI\'s and others to flesh out the </p><p>technical details of proposals and projects.  Nasser agreed a </p><p>joint team would be a good idea, but rejected significant IFI </p><p>involvement initially, saying he wanted to work directly with </p><p>the USG (as the "custodian" of Iraq in the aftermath of a </p><p>military strike) to define the scope and outline of </p><p>development plans. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ACTION REQUEST:  Post understands LTG (ret.) Jay </p><p>Garner, head of OSD\'s new Office for Reconstruction and </p><p>Humanitarian Affairs, along with Ambassador George Ward </p><p>(Humanitarian Assistance), USAID officer Lew Lucke </p><p>(Reconstruction), and Michael Mobbs (Civil Administration) </p><p>will soon be setting up shop in the region.  We intend to </p><p>introduce these officials to Al-Khorsheed and to Shaykh </p><p>Nasser at their earliest convenience.  Post requests guidance </p><p>on any more appropriate interlocutors, and on any parameters </p><p>that should guide our discussions with the GOK on Iraqi </p><p>reconstruction.  One caveat: so far, Sheikh Nasser is the </p><p>only official who has been eager to engage on this topic. </p><p>The extent to which his views represent the GOK\'s is unknown. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
