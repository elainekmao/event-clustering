<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001049 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, CA/OCS, M/MED, OES/PCI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AMED, SOCI, TBIO, ECON, CASC, CA, SARS, Health </p><p>SUBJECT: WGSARS: Update 8 - Ontario SARS Health Emergency </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Toronto 1048 and previous </p><p> </p><p>1. Ottawa transmitting text of AmConsul Toronto. </p><p> </p><p>2. Fatalities:  As of COB April 9, no new SARS deaths have </p><p>been reported, leaving the number of SARS fatalities in </p><p>Ontario at ten. </p><p> </p><p>3. Number of cases: Health Canada\'s April 9 SARS advisory </p><p>lists approximately 195 cases of SARS in Ontario, including </p><p>94 probable and 101 suspect cases, an increase of 3 probable </p><p>and 2 suspect cases since April 8 reporting. A total of 49 </p><p>patients treated for SARS have been discharged from </p><p>hospital.  All Ontario cases, according to the advisory, </p><p>have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asian SARS </p><p>hotspots or had contact with SARS cases in a household or in </p><p>a health-care setting. </p><p> </p><p>4. Prophylactic measures: Acting on the recommendation of </p><p>Toronto Public Health as a precautionary measure, the </p><p>Toronto District School Board closed two Toronto high </p><p>schools until April 15, a closure affecting almost 1500 </p><p>persons.  One student who developed SARS-like symptoms last </p><p>week is undergoing review to determine cause of illness. </p><p>Leading daily "Toronto Star" reported on April 10 that York </p><p>region health officers have requested home quarantine for </p><p>all those who were at Hewlett Packard\'s suburban Toronto </p><p>facility in Markham from March 29 to April 1. </p><p> </p><p>5. The Provincial Ministry of Health is opening up </p><p>additional space at the Oakville Lifecare Centre at the </p><p>outskirts of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to move patients </p><p>awaiting long-term care placement out of Toronto hospitals, </p><p>freeing GTA hospital beds for acute care patients.  The </p><p>April 9 "Toronto Star" reports that province-wide SARS </p><p>health-care measures were working, as exemplified by smooth </p><p>operational procedures at a rural Ontario hospital in </p><p>Listowel. A suspect SARS patient, back from Asian travel, </p><p>was admitted and "quickly whisked into an isolation area." </p><p>"We are ready right at the door and so we picked [the case] </p><p>up with our screening tool," stated the hospital\'s CEO as </p><p>reported in the "Star." </p><p> </p><p>6. Economic impacts:  According to media reports, including </p><p>Reuters on April 10, Wal-Mart Stores has temporarily barred </p><p>its employees from traveling to the Toronto area, while </p><p>asking staff returning from Toronto (as well as SARS Asian </p><p>hotspots) to remain at home for 10 days.  The GTA contains 9 </p><p>Wal-Mart complexes plus the company\'s home office in Canada. </p><p>On the good news front, the "Star" reports major conventions </p><p>maintaining schedules in Toronto, including this week\'s </p><p>2,000-delegate National Association of School Psychologists </p><p>and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
