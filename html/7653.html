The WHO Travel Advisory released on April 23 that </p><p>recommended against travel to Toronto precipitated </p><p>vigorous dissent from the Federal Health Minister Anne </p><p>McLellan, from Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman and from </p><p>provincial and federal public health officials (ref B). </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister John Manley described the WHO </p><p>advisory as "unwarranted", although Prime Minister </p><p>Chretien has not joined the fray as he is out of the </p><p>country on vacation.  On April 23 Health Canada sent </p><p>WHO a letter which formally challenged the WHO Travel </p><p>Advisory decision. </p><p> </p><p>2. Meanwhile, for a brief period on April 23 the </p><p>Minister of Health of the province of Nova Scotia, in </p><p>an address to members of the provincial legislature </p><p>urged residents of that province to heed the WHO travel </p><p>advice and avoid travel to Toronto.  The Nova Scotian </p><p>Minister back-tracked after several hours. </p><p> </p><p>3. As of 13:00 Eastern Daylight Saving Time, April 22, </p><p>2003 Health Canada has received reports of 324 probable </p><p>or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome </p><p>(SARS) in Canada.  To date, transmission has been </p><p>limited to specific transmission settings such as </p><p>households, hospitals and specific community settings. </p><p>The details of the cases to date are as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-- Ontario is reporting 136 probable and 125 suspect </p><p>cases.  This is an increase of 1 probable and 1 suspect </p><p>case since Report #5.  (See Toronto reporting for </p><p>greater detail.  All the 15 Canadian deaths have been </p><p>linked to the Toronto nexus, 14 probable cases and 1 </p><p>suspected case.) </p><p> </p><p>-- British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 47 </p><p>suspect cases. This is an increase of 6 suspect cases </p><p>since Report #5., see also paragraph 4. </p><p> </p><p>-- New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases. (No </p><p>change.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case. (No </p><p>change.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases. (No change) </p><p> </p><p>-- Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases. </p><p>(No change.) </p><p> </p><p>4. According to Press reports, Public Health officials </p><p>in British Columbia are attempting to locate passengers </p><p>who arrived in Vancouver on April 19 on a China </p><p>Airlines flight from New Delhi, India, via Taipei, </p><p>Taiwan.  Eight of the passengers have subsequently </p><p>developed symptoms of SARS.  The flight may have </p><p>carried as many as 250 passengers.  Of the passengers </p><p>who have developed signs of SARS, a two-year-old girl </p><p>and an adult have been hospitalized while the other six </p><p>remain in home isolation. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
