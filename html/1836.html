<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001925 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: KOUYATE ON U.S. ACCREDITATION TO ECOWAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1745 </p><p>     B. BAMAKO 2153 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C)  Summary.  Ambassador met with ECOWAS Executive </p><p>Secretary Kouyate on July 27.  Kouyate indicated that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>accreditation of the American Ambassador to the ECOWAS </p><p>Secretariat should be easily accomplished by the Mediation </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>and Security Council, and could occur during its scheduled </p><p>late September session.  He also thanked Ambassador for </p><p>receipt of the certification of ECOWAS to receive security </p><p>assistance, and conveyed Deputy Executive Secretary Diarra\'s </p><p>thanks for his inclusion in the ACRI exercise in Dakar.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador Jeter met ECOWAS Executive Secretary </p><p>Lansana Kouyate in Abuja on July 27, to continue discussion </p><p>of accrediting the American Ambassador to Nigeria to the </p><p>ECOWAS Secretariat (raised earlier by the DCM,in Kouyate\'s </p><p>absence, with newly-arrived Deputy Executive Secretary Sene. </p><p>Ref A).  Ambassador noted President Konare\'s reportedly </p><p>enthusiastic support for the idea in his meeting with our </p><p>Embassy in Bamako (Ref B), but emphasized that our discussion </p><p>of the proposal at this point was purely informal.  Kouyate </p><p>warmly welcomed the idea, saying that accreditation would be </p><p>"very useful."  He turned to an ECOWAS official from the </p><p>Legal Affairs Office for her opinion on the feasibility of </p><p>such an accreditation, and she opined that as there was </p><p>"nothing for or against it" in the ECOWAS Treaty, it could </p><p>very likely be done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ambassador noted that a similar relationship existed </p><p>between our Embassy in Addis and the OAU, and our Embassy in </p><p>Gaborone and the SADC Secretariat.  Kouyate replied that some </p><p>resident Ambassadors from the ECOWAS states in Abuja were </p><p>accredited to the Secretariat, and one other (unnamed) </p><p>western Ambassador had requested accreditation.  Kouyate then </p><p>said that the accreditation could easily be accomplished at </p><p>the next meeting of the Mediation and Security Council, </p><p>scheduled for the last week of September.  The ECOWAS </p><p>Authority of Heads of State could later endorse this </p><p>accreditation, he said, but that would probably not be </p><p>needed.  (Comment.  President Obasanjo has told the </p><p>Ambassador that he endorses the idea, saw no impediment, and </p><p>noted that Ambassadors from  ECOWAS member-states, including </p><p>Nigeria, were working to effect their own accreditation </p><p>before the American request was put forward.  End comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Kouyate also thanked the Ambassador for receipt of </p><p>the certification of ECOWAS to receive security assistance </p><p>from the USG. He mentioned that the Secretariat was </p><p>installing a sophisticated computerized auditing system, </p><p>which should enhance the comfort level among donors.  The EU </p><p>was particularly welcoming of this move.  Ambassador replied </p><p>that at the June donors meeting in Abuja of missions </p><p>interested in assisting ECOWAS, there was a very strong sense </p><p>of the need to act with "care and consultation" to avoid </p><p>duplification of effort and the imposition of </p><p>counter-productive pressure on the organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Kouyate then conveyed Deputy Executive Secretary </p><p>Diarra\'s thanks for his invitation to the just-completed ACRI </p><p>session in Dakar, saying that Diarra was "very, very </p><p>impressed."  Kouyate also mentioned in passing that, in </p><p>regard to efforts by ECOWAS to enhance telecommunications in </p><p>the region, he had been quite taken by the recent suggestion </p><p>that ECOWAS consider its own communications satellite.  This </p><p>might be possible if costs were shared among the fifteen </p><p>member-states.  A feasibility study would soon be under way, </p><p>he said, and the World Bank was assisting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Comment.   Kouyate welcomed the accreditation of </p><p>Ambassador Jeter to the Secretariat with enthusiasm equal to </p><p>that of ECOWAS Chairman President Konare of Mali, and </p><p>appeared to suggest it would be easily achieved.  It is also </p><p>significant that President Obasanjo also has endorsed the </p><p>idea.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
