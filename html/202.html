HU ADDED THAT THE "CHINESE PEOPLE WILL </p><p>STAND BY THE PALESTINIANS TILL THEIR FINAL VICTORY, </p><p>RESOLUTELY SUPPORT THE PLO, THE ONLY LEGITIMATE REPRE- </p><p>SENTATIVE OF THE PALESTINIANS, AND FIRMLY DEMAND THE </p><p>RESTORATION OF ALL THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHTS." </p><p> </p><p>CHINESE LEADERS HAVE ALSO MET WITH PALESTINIAN LEADERS </p><p>ON VISITS OVERSEAS.

ZHAO ALSO CALLED FOR ARAB AND INTERNAL PLO UNITY </p><p>AND ADVISED ARAFAT TO PAY GREATER ATTENTION TO POLITICAL </p><p>STRUGGLE. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MFA\'S "GENERAL REVIEW OF CHINA\'S </p><p>FOREIGN RELATIONS" (ZHONGGUO WAIJIAO GAILAN, 1987), </p><p>CHINA HAS MANY TIMES SINCE 1964 INVITED PALESTINIAN </p><p>FIGHTERS, MASS ORGANIZATIONS, STUDY GROUPS AND DELE- </p><p>GATIONS TO VISIT CHINA AND HAS FURTHERMORE PROVIDED THE </p><p>PLO AND PALESTINIAN FIGHTERS WITH WEAPONS, MONEY, </p><p>MEDICINE, MATERIAL AND OTHER ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>THE MFA DIPLOMATIC LIST SHOWS FOUR PLO REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>WORKING AT THE PLO MISSION IN BEIJING, ALL OF WHOM </p><p>APPARENTLY HAVE FULL DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES, INCLUDING </p><p>IMMUNITY AND THE USE OF THE POUCH.
