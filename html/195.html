<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 01313 </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMCONSUL DUBAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS, MARR, SOCI, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAQI MISSILE ATTACKS ON TEHRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ABOUT FORTY IRAQI MISSILES HAD FALLEN ON TEHRAN </p><p>AS OF LATE FRIDAY, MARCH 4, ACCORDING TO A TEHRAN BANKING </p><p>OFFICIAL RECENTLY INTERVIEWED AT AMCONSUL DUBAI.  THE </p><p>RATE OF MISSILE ATTACKS HAD FALLEN FROM AN INITIAL ONE </p><p>PER HALF HOUR TO ABOUT ONE EVERY FOUR HOURS BY FRIDAY. </p><p>WHILE MOST OF THE MISSILES FELL ON RESIDENTIAL AREAS, </p><p>FOUR HOSPITALS AND FOUR MILITARY BARRACKS HAD BEEN HIT, </p><p>THE SOURCE CLAIMED.  HE SAID MISSILES SHATTERED WINDOWS </p><p>WITHIN A TWO HUNDRED METER RADIUS OF IMPACT, CAUSING </p><p>MANY INJURIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  OUTWARDLY, LIFE IN TEHRAN GOES ON, BUT RESIDENTS </p><p>ARE ESPECIALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THE MISSILE ATTACKS </p><p>BECAUSE NO AIR RAID SIRENS ARE SOUNDED IN ADVANCE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO SEVERAL IRANIANS INTERVIEWED ON MARCH 5 AND </p><p>6.  WHILE RESIDENTS RECEIVE ADEQUATE WARNING OF IMPENDING </p><p>BOMB ATTACKS, THE FIRST AND ONLY WARNING OF A MISSLE </p><p>ATTACK IS THE APPARENTLY TERRIFYING NOISE THE MISSILE </p><p>MAKES SHORTLY BEFORE IMPACT.  ONE TEHRANI ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THE GREATEST EFFECT OF THE MISSILES IS PSYCHOLOG- </p><p>ICAL.  WHILE HE WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT ACTUALLY BEING </p><p>HIT, HE WAS UNDER CONSTANT STRESS BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TEHRAN AIRPORT IS OPERATING AS USUAL, BUT INTER- </p><p>NATIONAL TELEPHONE SERVICE HAS BEEN DISRUPTED.  AS </p><p>OF FRIDAY TEHRAN RESIDENTS TRYING TO CALL ABROAD WERE </p><p>GIVEN A RECORDING TELLING THEM TO DIAL THE OPERATOR, </p><p>WHO THEN TOLD THEM ALL LINES WERE FULL.  DUBAI SOURCES </p><p>HAVE TOLD US THAT SOME CALLS HAVE BEEN MADE FROM TEHRAN </p><p>TO DUBAI.  WE UNDERSTAND A SYSTEM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED </p><p>WHEREBY TEHRAN RESIDENTS MAY PLACE CALLS OF UP TO </p><p>THREE MINUTES FROM A CENTRAL EXCHANGE, PROVIDED THEY </p><p>LIMIT THEIR CONVERSATIONS TO PERSONAL TOPICS ONLY - </p><p>I.E., NOT THE CURRENT SITUATION IN TEHRAN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE GOI HAS FINGERED THE SOVIETS AS THE CULPRITS </p><p>FOR SUPPLYING THE MISSILES.  AN IRANIAN RESIDENT IN </p><p>DUBAI MONITERED A BROADCAST SPEECH BY KHOMEINI TWO </p><p>DAYS AGO CONDEMNING MOSCOW.  IRAN TV ALSO DISPLAYED </p><p>AN UNEXPLODED MISSILE WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE RUSSIAN </p><p>LETTERING, AND THE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZED A LARGE ANTI- </p><p>SOVIET PROTEST FOLLOWING FRIDAY (MARCH 4) PRAYERS. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT WAS CAREFUL, HOWEVER, TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE </p><p>POLICE PROTECTION TO THE SOVIET EMBASSY DURING THE </p><p>PROTEST. </p><p> </p><p>6.  BAGHDAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.  MACK </p><p></p></div>
