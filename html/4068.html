<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002337 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, EAID, ECON, ASEC, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: RULING PARTY STEPS UP ATTACKS AGAINST NGOS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2311 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) A recent ZANU-PF theft of WFP food in Nsiza and GOZ </p><p>orders to halt NGO food distribution in Binga come amid a </p><p>looming general GOZ crackdown on NGOs.  In mid September the </p><p>GOZ issued a notice for all NGOs to register with the </p><p>Ministry of Social Welfare, or cease operations.  It appears </p><p>that the GOZ is cracking down on NGOs that embarrass or are </p><p>critical of government.  A tightening crackdown against NGOs </p><p>distributing food under the WFP program would be the most </p><p>troubling, as it would lead to starvation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>RULING PARTY DISRUPTS NGO FOOD DISTRIBUTION </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) On October 4 local authorities ordered Save the </p><p>Children U.K. to halt food distribution in the Matabeleland </p><p>North town of Binga, five months after forcing the Catholic </p><p>Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) to stop distribution </p><p>efforts in the same town.  Authorities accused both </p><p>organizations of supporting the opposition MDC--a charge they </p><p>both deny as contrary to their policy of political </p><p>neutrality.  However, according to a Catholic priest in </p><p>Binga, two CCJP volunteers who did community organizing and </p><p>food distribution work in the Binga area, and were paid a </p><p>stipend of ZWD$5,000 (about US$5.00) per month, won MDC </p><p>council seats in the September rural council elections. </p><p>Zimbabwe Country Director of Save the Children, UK., Chris </p><p>McIvor, met with the Minister of Social Welfare and other GOZ </p><p>officials last week and is optimistic about restarting their </p><p>food distribution in Binga soon.  Tarcisius Zimbiti, Zimbabwe </p><p>Country Director of the CCJP, said he was waiting for the </p><p>"dust to settle" before pursuing a restart of their feeding </p><p>programs.  According to Chris Bowley, Emergencies Manager at </p><p>Save the Children UK., Binga has not received food for the </p><p>past two months.  On October 16, the independent Daily News </p><p>reported that two people in Binga had died recently of </p><p>starvation, and that school children were fainting at their </p><p>desks from hunger. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On October 18, ZANU-PF supporters in Insiza stole </p><p>three metric tons of food from WFP implementing partner the </p><p>Organization of Rural Associations for Progress (ORAP), and </p><p>distributed it to ZANU-PF supporters.  WFP halted all food </p><p>distribution in Insiza and requested assurances from GOZ </p><p>against further incidents of this kind.  Insiza will host a </p><p>parliamentary by-election on October 26-27.  (More details on </p><p>this incident are provided reftel). </p><p> </p><p>CRACKDOWN ON NGOs </p><p>----------------- </p><p>4. (C) The Insiza theft, and Binga halt orders come amid a </p><p>general crackdown on NGOs and moves to control their </p><p>activities.  Recently addressing the 51st ordinary session of </p><p>the ruling party, President Mugabe acknowledged the integral </p><p>role of NGOs in assistance programs, but accused some NGOs of </p><p>inappropriately campaigning for a change of the \'elected\' </p><p>government.  On October 18, the state-controlled newspaper </p><p>The Herald, reported the Minister of Social Welfare, July </p><p>Moyo as saying there were some NGOs whose agenda was mainly </p><p>to destabilize the country and the government was not going </p><p>to allow such covert activities.  The state-controlled </p><p>newspaper, The Sunday Mail, and The Herald, have recently </p><p>carried a barrage of criticism of Amani Trust, a prominent </p><p>human rights organization which counsels torture victims and </p><p>publicizes human rights violations, for being funded by the </p><p>UK. and U.S. and for "being involved in the politics of </p><p>Zimbabwe."  On October 13, Information Minister Jonathan Moyo </p><p>was quoted in The Sunday Mail as saying, "we must now do </p><p>something about all these NGOs which are receiving British </p><p>dirty money to destabilize Zimbabwe." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In mid September the GOZ issued a notice requiring all </p><p>NGOs to register with the Ministry of Social Welfare under </p><p>the Private Voluntary Organizations (PVO) Act, or cease </p><p>operations.  The registration process takes about 8 months </p><p>and NGOs complain it allows the GOZ to direct their programs </p><p>by giving the GOZ access to NGO budgets, funding sources, and </p><p>allowing GOZ representation on NGO governing boards.  Most </p><p>NGOs are currently registered as trusts with the Registrar of </p><p>Deeds and enjoy relative freedom from formal GOZ control. </p><p>The PVO Act, which has been in force in current form since </p><p>1996, is very broad, covering any organization providing </p><p>social services, development or relief assistance, or legal </p><p>aid.  Some private companies might be covered, but trusts, </p><p>churches, schools, and health services providers are </p><p>excepted.  There are differing interpretations over which </p><p>organizations the Act actually covers.  Most NGOs have </p><p>ignored the registration requirement but it is clear that the </p><p>GOZ now intends to enforce it.  To clarify enforcement </p><p>issues, the Attorney General\'s office is re-drafting the </p><p>legislation and is supposed to have a version ready in the </p><p>coming weeks.  (Note:  While the National Association of NGOs </p><p>(NANGO) has submitted language, the AG\'s office has not </p><p>consulted formally with any NGOs and it seems likely, given </p><p>the high-profile politics of this issue, that the new </p><p>legislation will be even more draconian than the present. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p>6. (C) It appears that the GOZ intends to crack down on NGOs </p><p>it considers thorns in its side--those that are openly </p><p>critical of government, that publicize information which </p><p>embarrasses the government or that the government does not </p><p>fully control.  The GOZ also appears unwilling to tolerate </p><p>NGOs with any connection to the MDC, although it does not </p><p>apply the same standard to NGOs who employ, or are connected </p><p>to ZANU-PF members.  Many organizations funded by the U.S. </p><p>Government which play a key role in treating human rights </p><p>victims and keeping space open for expression of alternative </p><p>views are likely to comprise the hit list.  Most NGOs with </p><p>which we cooperate are biding their time, hoping their input </p><p>into the new law will make it palatable.  If this effort </p><p>fails, we suspect they will try to find a way around the </p><p>registration requirement or go underground. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Further attacks, and a tightening crackdown against </p><p>NGOs distributing food under the WFP program would be the </p><p>most troubling, as slowing or halting their operations would </p><p>most likely lead to starvation in affected areas.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
