<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HO CHI MINH CITY 000499 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, KCRM, PGOV, PINR, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: NAM CAM TRIAL: A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR </p><p>JUDICIAL REFORM IN VIETNAM? </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  One day after the conclusion of the biggest trial </p><p>related to corruption and organized crime in the history of </p><p>Vietnam, the Vietnamese press is claiming that the judicial </p><p>system has fundamentally changed.  The conviction of 18 GVN </p><p>officials on charges of corruption and 136 private citizens for </p><p>crimes ranging from murder to usury, while perhaps only the tip </p><p>of the iceberg, seemed to bring some satisfaction to a public </p><p>seeking justice.  There remains considerable skepticism, </p><p>however, that this will reverse the tide of widespread </p><p>corruption in Vietnam.   There was greater optimism about reform </p><p>of the trial process, since in this trial the court gave defense </p><p>attorneys greater access to the criminal investigations against </p><p>their clients, greater access to their clients, and greater </p><p>freedom of speech.  While the sentences may not have been </p><p>uniformly applied between private citizens and government </p><p>officials, and there is ongoing debate about specific </p><p>individuals and/or charges, there was a sense that the </p><p>convictions and sentences were basically fair.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Was Nam Cam Really the Biggest Fish? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  The headliner in the case was the organized crime kingpin </p><p>Truong Van Cam (a.k.a. Nam Cam), whose penetration of HCMC </p><p>police was allegedly so pervasive that a special police task </p><p>force from other provinces had to be brought in to arrest him. </p><p>In jail since December 2001, on June 5, 2003 he received two </p><p>death sentences -- for the murder of Dung Ha and for bribery -- </p><p>and a total of 42 years in prison for the additional crimes of </p><p>causing intentional harm, organized gambling, concealing </p><p>criminals and trying to flee the country.  During the pre-trial </p><p>investigation and in trial testimony Nam Cam denied the charge </p><p>of ordering the death of Dung Ha, a rival gangster.  Press </p><p>reports said he plans to appeal the verdicts and sentences in </p><p>his case.  But even if the sentence for murder is overturned, </p><p>Nam Cam is unlikely to escape death by firing squad for the </p><p>bribery conviction.  Both he and his lawyer told the </p><p>international press they believed the trial was fair. </p><p> </p><p>3.  A total of 19 government officials were charged with crimes </p><p>related to the Nam Cam syndicate.  Eighteen of them -- including </p><p>Tran Mai Hanh(former head of Voice of Vietnam state radio) and </p><p>Pham Sy Chien (former deputy chief of the Supreme People\'s </p><p>Prosecutor\'s Office), both expelled from the Communist Party </p><p>(CP) Central Committee (reftel) -- were sentenced to jail terms. </p><p>The defense attorney for one official -- HCMC police detective </p><p>Lam Xuan Phat -- succeeded in having the charges against his </p><p>client dropped, because the statute of limitations had expired </p><p>for any investigation into a crime he was accused of committing </p><p>in 1988.  The three highest-ranking former GVN officials have </p><p>not yet been taken into custody.  They will appeal their </p><p>sentences to the Supreme Court in Hanoi.  While all but one of </p><p>the government officials accused has been sentenced to jail, </p><p>another 72 government officials from 37 different </p><p>departments/organizations have been disciplined.  This includes </p><p>52 policemen who have been suspended or removed from duty.  Many </p><p>of the GVN officials were also expelled from party </p><p>organizations, as an administrative punishment.  The HCMC </p><p>People\'s Court also delivered 24 suspended sentences and </p><p>released 10 individuals for time served or pending further </p><p>investigation into their cases. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Justice Better Served?  What Was Different This Time Around </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Several high-ranking GVN officials announced to the </p><p>international media early on during the Nam Cam investigation </p><p>that this would be a model case for reform within the justice </p><p>system.  According to local Vietnamese lawyers and legal </p><p>analysts who have been following the trial, this has been true </p><p>in limited measure.  The Vietnamese legal system is loosely </p><p>based on the French civil law system.  When an individual is </p><p>arrested for breaking the law, the person is put into detention </p><p>for up to four months while the criminal investigators prepare </p><p>the case for prosecution.  Prior to the Nam Cam case, although </p><p>exceptions have been known to occur, the individual was </p><p>generally not allowed to meet with a defense attorney during </p><p>this "investigation" period.  However, over the past year, a </p><p>number of attorneys defending clients in the Nam Cam case have </p><p>been able to meet with their clients -- whether in prison or at </p><p>large -- to discuss defense strategy. </p><p> </p><p>5.  In the Vietnamese system, after the investigation phase is </p><p>over, the investigator gives the results to the prosecutor\'s </p><p>office.  The prosecutor\'s office then submits an analysis of the </p><p>portions of the legal code the accused has allegedly violated. </p><p>It also proposes a range of sentences based on these violations </p><p>to the panel of judges who will hear the case in trial.  One </p><p>legal analyst close to the Nam Cam case told us the Politburo </p><p>had a great deal of input into what the eventual charges and </p><p>sentences would be.  On the other hand, this analyst added, </p><p>usually the results of an investigation are not available to the </p><p>defense attorney until the first day of the trial, making it </p><p>very difficult to mount a defense.  During the Nam Cam case, </p><p>however, a number of defense attorneys were able to obtain the </p><p>results of the investigations into their clients\' alleged crimes </p><p>prior to the trial. </p><p> </p><p>6.  At trial, the panel of judges listens to arguments from the </p><p>prosecution and defense, and decides on the sentence, usually </p><p>within the range proposed by the prosecutor.  Prior to the Nam </p><p>Cam case, if the defense attorney attempted to present a line of </p><p>reasoning that did not directly flow from the investigation, or </p><p>criticized the facts presented by the prosecution as revealed in </p><p>the investigation, the panel of judges would often silence the </p><p>attorney, claiming that the argument was beyond the scope of the </p><p>trial or simply "inappropriate".  However, one observer who </p><p>attended part of the trial said that during the Nam Cam case, </p><p>several defense attorneys pursued lines of questioning that did </p><p>not reflect the "facts" of the investigation as presented by the </p><p>prosecution, and the panel of judges did not overrule these </p><p>attorneys.  In what several lawyers described to ConGenoff as a </p><p>highly unusual occurrence, the prosecution was almost uniformly </p><p>quiet, while the judges pursued more lines of questioning with </p><p>the defense attorneys. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The same observer criticized the court for some of its </p><p>actions.  He noted that the court did not pursue several senior </p><p>government officials who had been subpoenaed but failed to </p><p>appear.  The HCMC People\'s Court excused their absences for </p><p>health reasons or with no explanation. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The actual decision on sentencing may also have been </p><p>inappropriately influenced.  After the conclusion of the trial </p><p>period on May 22, the court adjourned for 10 days, during which </p><p>the panel of judges was to deliberate over the sentences. </p><p>During this period, the Chief Judge traveled to Hanoi, a move </p><p>that one Vietnamese lawyer contact interpreted to mean he had </p><p>gone to receive instructions from the Politburo or Central </p><p>Committee.  There was widespread discussion in the local </p><p>newspapers as to which GVN or CP organ would ultimately </p><p>determine the fate of the accused, and the international media </p><p>called Nam Cam\'s death sentence a "foregone conclusion."  Legal </p><p>analysts considered ten days a relatively short timeframe in </p><p>which to decide the fate of 155 individuals accused of multiple </p><p>crimes. </p><p> </p><p>9.  In the end, the various sentences handed down were not </p><p>perceived as excessive or unfair either in the media or among </p><p>the Vietnamese we talked with.  Rumors that some GVN officials </p><p>would be given disproportionately light sentences had been </p><p>sparked after June 4, when a judge prefaced the reading of their </p><p>verdicts with the caveat that the "revolutionary sacrifices" of </p><p>those officials and/or their family members would be taken into </p><p>consideration during sentencing.  There appeared to be some </p><p>relief that the key government officials had received jail </p><p>sentences.  Since there is no public court record to disclose </p><p>the details of the investigation and the arguments made at </p><p>trial, the appropriateness of the sentencing will remain a </p><p>source of legal debate. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Media Access:  Organized but not Controlled </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  During the course of the trial, local Vietnamese reporters </p><p>said they were granted reasonable access.  Daily coverage of the </p><p>trial appeared in all five of Ho Chi Minh City\'s daily </p><p>newspapers.  HCMC\'s two evening television news shows only </p><p>reported on the trial\'s major developments: the testimony of </p><p>government officials, the opening and closing statements, and </p><p>the sentencing phase of the trial.  Only the Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>state-run television station, HTV, was allowed to have </p><p>television cameras in the courtroom.  Cameras were present for </p><p>the duration of the trial, although only opening statements and </p><p>the sentencing  were broadcast live on television.  Members of </p><p>the international press were only permitted to cover the trial\'s </p><p>opening statements and the sentencing phase. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Media coverage was organized, as each Vietnamese newspaper </p><p>had to register with the Court for access to the proceedings.  A </p><p>maximum of two reporters and one photographer from each </p><p>newspaper were permitted to cover the entire trial.  Only </p><p>reporters who had registered and received a press badge could </p><p>enter the courthouse.  Due to space limitations, journalists </p><p>were funneled into a small room where they could watch the trial </p><p>via closed-circuit TV.  At the start of each day, photographers </p><p>were allowed into the courtroom for ten minutes to photograph </p><p>the defendants. </p><p> </p><p>12.  According to a reporter who works for Tuoi Tre and HCMC </p><p>Radio, Vietnamese reporters were only censored in their coverage </p><p>of the trial by their editors when the subject matter encroached </p><p>on "national security" (loosely defined).  This reporter did not </p><p>specify what comments were cut, but said journalists were able </p><p>to include quotes from the prosecution, defense attorneys and </p><p>defendants obtained inside or outside the courtroom. </p><p> </p><p>13.   Comment:  Mr. Bui Hoang Danh, one of the judges in the </p><p>trial, tried to make the point repeatedly to the media that this </p><p>case was not about widespread corruption, but about the crimes </p><p>of private citizens and public officials alike.  This became a </p><p>point of distinction between the local media, which portrayed </p><p>the case as "the case of Nam Cam and his associates," and the </p><p>international media, who described it as a major corruption </p><p>scandal.  A few local legal analysts view this case as </p><p>significant because the disparities in sentencing between </p><p>average (if scumbag) Joes and mighty government officials was </p><p>not extreme.  Despite the "revolutionary" sacrifices by some of </p><p>the officials being tried, all but one received prison </p><p>sentences, including up to 12 years.  This is a message that has </p><p>met with widespread approval.  Still, a lot can happen between </p><p>now and the appeal.  Once the dust settles on this large-scale </p><p>organized crime and corruption trial, we will see whether the </p><p>GVN will gear itself up for a sustained crackdown on official </p><p>corruption.  End Comment. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
