<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000264 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S, AF/PDPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOVERNMENT WITNESS IMPLICATES U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN ALLEGED ASSASSINATION PLOT </p><p> </p><p>REF: Harare 259, Harare 230 </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The February 6 edition of the government-owned </p><p>     "Herald" newspaper reports that Ari Ben-Menashe, the </p><p>     government\'s star witness in the treason trial of </p><p>     opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and two other </p><p>     opposition leaders, claimed in court that he believed </p><p>     the U.S. Government knew of the alleged assassination </p><p>     plot against Robert Mugabe and that he believed that a </p><p>     participant in one of his meetings with Tsvangirai was </p><p>     a CIA official.  The "Herald" plays these claims to </p><p>     the hilt, running the page-one story under the banner </p><p>     headline "Key Witness Names CIA."  Copies of the </p><p>     article have been faxed to AF/S and AF/PDPA. </p><p> </p><p>  2.    According to Mr. Ben Menashe, participants in </p><p>     the alleged conspiracy to rid Zimbabwe of Robert </p><p>     Mugabe now include former President Clinton, the </p><p>     "Jewish community in America" and the CIA, among a </p><p>     long and generalized list of other groups and </p><p>     individuals.  Mr. Ben-Menashe offers Defense attorney </p><p>     George Bizos fertile ground for cross-examination. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
