<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005781 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRWA AND FAA 301(C) CONCERNS:  PRM PDAS GREENE\'S </p><p>MEETING ON THE MARGINS OF UNRWA\'S MAJOR DONORS MEETING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. JERUSALEM 2282 </p><p>     B. JERUSALEM 3025 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In a September 24 meeting on the margins of the UNRWA </p><p>Major Donors meeting (reported septel), PRM PDAS Richard </p><p>Greene pressed UNRWA Commissioner General Peter Hansen, </p><p>Deputy Commissioner General Karen AbuZayd, West Bank Director </p><p>Richard Cook and Gaza Director Lionel Brisson on the need for </p><p>UNRWA to do "everything in its power" to ensure terrorists do </p><p>not benefit from UNRWA assistance programs.  Specifically, he </p><p>asked that UNRWA establish a more elaborate program to </p><p>monitor and protect its installations and programs, including </p><p>more regular inspections by international staff, increased </p><p>staff training, institution of background checks on employees </p><p>in the West Bank and Gaza, and severance of all ties to youth </p><p>activities centers.  Greene also briefed UNRWA senior </p><p>management on pending legislation requiring a GAO review of </p><p>State Department compliance with section 301(C) of the </p><p>Foreign Assistance Act, noting that it would require the </p><p>Secretary of State to provide an annual certification that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>U.S. law prohibiting the use of funds to support terrorism is </p><p>being enforced to the fullest extent possible. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Hansen replied that although UNRWA cannot disagree </p><p>with the goals outlined by Greene, there still is a question </p><p>of how to reach common goals.  Background checks, for </p><p>example, are difficult as the PA currently is unable to </p><p>provide basic security much less run criminal background </p><p>checks on prospective UNRWA employees.  Hansen added that </p><p>UNRWA could not ask Israeli authorities to vet prospective </p><p>UNRWA employees, as that could create the false impression </p><p>that the agency and its employees are "collaborators." </p><p>Noting that the Israeli government still had not responded to </p><p>UNRWA\'s longstanding requests for information on employees </p><p>detained by the Israeli authorities, Hansen speculated that </p><p>the Israelis likely would be unwilling to work with UNRWA on </p><p>enhanced staff security measures.  Hansen added that, in </p><p>spite of promises made by Danny Naveh, the Israelis never </p><p>have shared specific information on alleged wrongdoing by </p><p>UNRWA employees.  (Comment:  The Israelis seem instead to </p><p>have shared the information with the USG, in the nonpaper </p><p>discussed ref a.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Nevertheless, Hansen reassured Greene that UNRWA was </p><p>taking steps to ensure its programs and installations remain </p><p>free from outside influences.  UNRWA is working with Israel </p><p>and the PA to ensure that the integrity of UN installations </p><p>is respected in the current security environment.  It also </p><p>has stepped up efforts to ensure political material remains </p><p>outside classrooms.  And thanks to USG funding, UNRWA will </p><p>soon have eight new international staff on board which will </p><p>allow the agency to increase the frequency with which it </p><p>monitors installations.  West Bank Director Cook added that </p><p>even without the new international staff, the West Bank field </p><p>now requires that every UNRWA installation be checked by an </p><p>international staff member once every three months.  Cook </p><p>noted that the previous inspection rate was once every six </p><p>months. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In response to specific concerns raised by Greene, </p><p>Deputy ComGen AbuZayd reported that UNRWA had severed all </p><p>ties to youth activities centers "a decade ago," although </p><p>some Gaza centers continued to be located "next to" UN </p><p>facilities.  (Note:  In spite of AbuZayd\'s assertion, UNRWA\'S </p><p>2002-3 budget includes plans to spend USD 289,000 in support </p><p>of 27 youth activities centers in Lebanon, the West Bank and </p><p>Gaza.)  West Bank Director Cook also clarified that, although </p><p>certain UNRWA temporary employment programs in the West Bank </p><p>are administered by local camp committees (ref b), UNRWA </p><p>social workers and camp services officers vet beneficiary </p><p>lists to ensure that beneficiaries are indeed registered </p><p>refugees without a known history of terrorist activity. </p><p>(Comment:  Without an agreed-upon definition of what </p><p>constitutes a terrorist, access to Israeli or PA-provided </p><p>lists of known terrorists, or even its own security apparatus </p><p>to make these determinations, UNRWA remains largely unable to </p><p>vet beneficiary lists for anything other than its own </p><p>needs-based criteria.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment and recommendation:  Although UNRWA has taken </p><p>some measures to remind staff of their obligations as </p><p>international civil servants and to refine existing </p><p>monitoring procedures, further steps should be taken to </p><p>ensure that UNRWA has taken every possible measure to ensure </p><p>beneficiaries have not engaged in acts of terrorism.  Such </p><p>steps should include:  severance of all ties -- including </p><p>financial support -- to youth activities centers; an </p><p>agency-wide policy requiring some form of background checks </p><p>on employees; an agency-wide policy requiring international </p><p>staff to inspect every UNRWA installation at least once every </p><p>three months; and some form of enhanced verification of </p><p>agency beneficiaries\' bona fides.  We understand that the </p><p>Department already is working on a formal request that UNRWA </p><p>undertake such measures. </p><p>6.  (C) Finally, we note that in order to better screen </p><p>beneficiaries, UNRWA must have improved cooperation with </p><p>Israeli authorities on security-related issues.  We recommend </p><p>the Department again urge Israeli authorities to share with </p><p>UNRWA derogatory information on UNRWA employees and respond </p><p>to UNRWA\'s long-standing request for information on employees </p><p>detained by the Israelis.  End comment and recommendation. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) PRM PDAS Greene cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
