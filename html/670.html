<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BRUSSELS 08603 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, PHUM, PTER, LE, RAID </p><p>SUBJECT:  LEBANESE AMBASSADOR FAWZI SALLOUKH CAUTIOUS </p><p>ABOUT PROGRESS IN THE SYRIAN/LEBANESE TRACKS OF THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST PEACE TALKS </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY.  FAWZI SALLOUKH, LEBANESE AMBASSADOR TO THE </p><p>EU AND BELGIUM, PAID A COURTESY CALL AUGUST 1 ON </p><p>AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT.  SALLOUKH HAS BEEN IN BRUSSELS </p><p>SINCE LAST APRIL AND HAS FOUND THE PACE LESS HECTIC THAN </p><p>AT HIS LAST POST--WHICH WAS VIENNA--WHERE HE HAD TO </p><p>COVER A BROADER RANGE OF ISSUES.  THE LESS HECTIC PACE </p><p>ALSO APPEARS TO BE THE RESULT OF "THIN" EU-LEBANESE </p><p>TIES, WHICH ARE UNLIKELY TO GROW STRONGER SO LONG AS </p><p>LEBANON REMAINS OUTSIDE THE MULTILATERAL TALKS. </p><p>SALLOUKH BLAMED TEL AVIV FOR THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE </p><p>ISRAELI-LEBANESE BILATERALS, ASSERTING BEIRUT COULD </p><p>DISARM HIZBALLAH ONCE THE ISRAELIS LEAVE SOUTHERN </p><p>LEBANON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>SALLOUKH BELIEVES ASAD HAS TIME TO WAIT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT ASKED ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS GIVEN THE RECENT </p><p>ISRAELI-JORDANIAN AGREEMENT.  SALLOUKH AGREED THAT </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS WERE PROMISING AND WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AN </p><p>EVENTUAL SETTLEMENT, BUT SAID SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD HAS </p><p>THE ABILITY TO "WAIT."  THE ISRAELI-JORDANIAN AND </p><p>ISRAELI-PLO ACCORDS CONSTITUTE TWO "POSITIVE STEPS </p><p>FORWARD," BUT COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED THE "FINAL </p><p>SOLUTION" TO THE PROBLEM.  HE ALSO WARNED AGAINST A </p><p>STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH--SUCH AS FOLLOWED IN THE </p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CASE--TO SOLVING THE </p><p>ISRAELI-SYRIAN/LEBANESE DIFFERENCES. </p><p> </p><p>4. ONCE THERE IS A RESOLUTION, HE SAW NORMALIZATION OF </p><p>ISRAELI-SYRIAN AND ISRAELI-LEBANESE TIES AS HAVING THE </p><p>POTENTIAL TO PROCEED MORE RAPIDLY THAN HAPPENED FOR </p><p>EGYPT AND ISRAEL AFTER THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS.  HE SAID, </p><p>THOUGH, THAT ISRAEL MIGHT BE "AFRAID" OF THE POTENTIAL </p><p>FOR ISRAELI-LEBANESE ECONOMIC COMPETITION.  HE FELT, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, THAT LEBANESE AND ISRAELI AGRICULTURE WOULD </p><p>BE COMPETITORS. </p><p> </p><p>5. SALLOUKH SAID LEBANESE PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>MULTILATERALS DEPENDS ON PROGRESS IN THE BILATERALS, </p><p>WHICH IN TURN IS PREDICATED ON THE "UNCONDITIONAL </p><p>WITHDRAWAL" OF ISRAELI TROOPS FROM THE SOUTHERN SECURITY </p><p>ZONE.  SALLOUKH SAID THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT THOUGHT ITS </p><p>LEVERAGE IN THE BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE WEAKENED </p><p>BY JOINING THE MULTILATERALS.  SALLOUKH, NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>TRIES TO KEEP HIS GOVERNMENT ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>THE MULTILATERAL TRACK BY SENDING BACK REPORTS ON THEIR </p><p>PROGRESS.  HE SAID THE EU WAS HELPFUL IN THIS REGARD BY </p><p>GIVING HIM READOUTS OF THE VARIOUS MULTILATERAL </p><p>MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>6. IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT\'S QUESTION, </p><p>SALLOUKH WAS CONFIDENT THAT, IF ISRAEL WITHDRAWS, </p><p>LEBANESE AUTHORITIES COULD REASSERT CONTROL OVER </p><p>SOUTHERN LEBANON AND DISARM THE HIZBALLAH.  HE SAID </p><p>LEBANON CANNOT DISARM HIZBALLAH NOW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE </p><p>SEEN AS A "TRAITOROUS" ACT BY THE LOCAL POPULATION IN </p><p>VIEW OF THE ISRAELI "OCCUPATION."  ONCE THE ISRAELIS </p><p>LEFT, SALLOUKH SAID SYRIAN TROOPS WOULD ALSO WITHDRAW. </p><p>SALLOUKH REFERRED TO A RECENT STATEMENT BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WHICH AFFIRMED ITS INTENT TO DEPLOY 25,000 </p><p>TROOPS TO SOUTHERN LEBANON IF ISRAELI TROOPS WOULD </p><p>LEAVE.  IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S CONDEMNATION OF </p><p>THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN LONDON AND LATIN </p><p>AMERICA, SALLOUKH UNDERLINED LEBANESE CONDEMNATION OF </p><p>ALL "KILLINGS," BUT SAID THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OR PROOF </p><p>OF HIZBALLAH PARTICIPATION IN THE ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>7. AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT ASKED ABOUT SYRIA\'S INFLUENCE </p><p>OVER THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.  SALLOUKH SAID SYRIA </p><p>AND LEBANON WERE LIKE "TWIN" COUNTRIES.  THERE IS SO </p><p>MUCH INTERMARRIAGE THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE.  THIS IS </p><p>THE CASE, HE SAID, FOR BOTH CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM </p><p>FAMILIES IN LEBANON AND SYRIA.  HE NOTED THEY WERE </p><p>ADMINISTERED AS ONE UNIT DURING THE PERIOD OF OTTOMAN </p><p>RULE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>ECONOMIC RECOVERY STILL STALLED </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT ASKED ABOUT PRIME MINISTER </p><p>HARIRI\'S HORIZON 2000 PLAN FOR DOUBLING PER CAPITA GDP </p><p>IN TEN YEARS.  SALLOUKH SAID IT WAS GETTING A GOOD </p><p>RECEPTION IN PARLIAMENT.  HE BEMOANED THE LACK OF </p><p>AVAILABLE OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE.  HE SAID THAT ARAB SOURCES </p><p>HAD DRIED UP.  THE MONIES, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT LEBANON HAD </p><p>BEEN PROMISED AT THE TIME OF THE TAIF ACCORD HAD BEEN </p><p>DIVERTED DUE TO THE GULF WAR.  HE HOPED THAT THE RECENT </p><p>WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE OF USD 175 MILLION WOULD PROVE A </p><p>CATALYST FOR OTHER DONORS, BUT ADMITTED LEBANON\'S </p><p>REFUSAL TO JOIN THE MULTILATERALS WOULD PROBABLY </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE A STUMBLING BLOCK TO MAJOR OUTSIDE </p><p>ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>9. IN THE EVENT THAT LEBANON JOINS THE PEACE PROCESS AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AID IS UNFROZEN, AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT </p><p>ASKED ABOUT WHICH SECTORS COULD BENEFIT MOST FROM </p><p>INVESTMENT.  SALLOUKH RESPONDED THAT LEBANON\'S </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY NEEDED ASSISTANCE THE MOST. </p><p>LEBANESE AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD-HIT BY </p><p>THE LACK OF OUTSIDE MARKETS.  SALLOUKH CITED THE EU, </p><p>WHICH SLAPS A TWENTY-SEVEN-AND-HALF PERCENT TARIFF ON </p><p>IMPORTED FRUITS FROM LEBANON.  HE WAS ALSO ADAMANT THAT </p><p>MORE MONEY SHOULD NOT GO INTO THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR. </p><p>GULF ARABS\' PURCHASES WERE DRIVING UP PRICES IN THE </p><p>BEIRUT REAL ESTATE MARKET TO SUCH LEVELS THAT MOST </p><p>LEBANESE COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY.  HE SAID PROPERTY </p><p>PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN IN WEST EUROPEAN CITIES.  WHAT </p><p>REMAINS OF LEBANON\'S MIDDLE CLASS SUFFERS FROM THE RISE </p><p>IN PROPERTY PRICES, WHILE THE OVERALL ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS </p><p>HAVE FED DISCONTENT IN BEIRUT\'S "POVERTY BELT." </p><p> </p><p>10. SALLOUKH THOUGHT PROSPECTS WERE BRIGHT FOR THE </p><p>TOURIST TRADE ONCE PEACE IS FULLY RESTORED.  LEBANON </p><p>ENJOYED 250 KILOMETERS OF SEASHORE AND PLENTY OF </p><p>HISTORICAL SITES TO INTEREST THE FOREIGN VISITOR. </p><p>SALLOUKH SAID SOME OUTSIDE MONEY WAS BEGINNING TO FLOW </p><p>IN TO REBUILD THE LUXURY RESORTS ALONG THE COAST. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>EU-LEBANESE TIES ON THE THIN SIDE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT ASKED ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF </p><p>EU-LEBANESE TIES.  SALLOUKH SAID HE TRIED TO INTEREST </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT IN UPGRADING THE 1977 TRADE AND </p><p>COOPERATION ACCORD IN VIEW OF THE EU NEGOTIATIONS WITH </p><p>OTHER MASHREK AND MAGHREB COUNTRIES.  HOWEVER, THE EU IS </p><p>NOT INTERESTED UNTIL LEBANON JOINS THE MULTILATERAL </p><p>PROCESS.  HE REITERATED THAT THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL NOT JOIN THE MULTILATERAL UNTIL THERE IS PROGRESS </p><p>IN THE BILATERALS.  THEREFORE, EU-LEBANESE TIES SUFFER </p><p>FROM AN "IMPASSE."  IN CLOSING, AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT </p><p>ASSURED HIM OF U.S. DETERMINATION TO ACHIEVE A LASTING </p><p>PEACE IN THE REGION AND THE HOPE THAT U.S.-LEBANESE TIES </p><p>CAN BE STRENGTHENED. </p><p> </p><p>(DRAFTED:POL:MBURROWS;CLEARED:POL:PHILBURN; </p><p>ADCM:JGREENWALD; APPROVED:AMB:SEEIZENSTAT.) </p><p> </p><p>EIZENSTAT </p><p></p></div>
