USUN 137 </p><p>     B. KANESHIRO/JONES 1/22/03 E-MAIL </p><p>     C. PARIS 551 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES, REASONS 1.5 B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The Ambassador raised Kuwait\'s request (refs A and B) </p><p>for a hold on the French proposal to include the </p><p>Kuwaiti-based organization Lajnat ad-Da\'wa al-Islamiya (LDI) </p><p>on UN freeze orders with Kuwaiti Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Dr. Shaykh Mohammed al-Sabah in a one-on-one </p><p>meeting on the morning of January 22.  Stressing that U.S. </p><p>information corroborated and went beyond what the French had </p><p>given the UN, the Ambassador told Shaykh Mohammed that we </p><p>wanted the GOK to lift its hold. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Dr. Mohammed replied candidly that he had no idea </p><p>what was behind the Kuwaiti request for a delay; neither he </p><p>nor Minister of Foreign Affairs Shaykh Sabah al-Sabah had </p><p>been consulted on this issue.  When the Ambassador posited </p><p>that perhaps somebody was trying to spare LDI\'s parent </p><p>organization, the Muslim Brotherhood\'s (MB) Social Reform </p><p>Society, embarrassment, Dr. Mohammed recalled that when the </p><p>US gave the GOK troubling information on branch offices of </p><p>the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society, another Kuwaiti </p><p>charity, last year, the GOK took action on it immediately. </p><p>This showed the GOK was not afraid to make waves with </p><p>Islamists.  In fact, if an MB affiliate got put in the docket </p><p>now it would help show Salafi supporters of the RIHS that it </p><p>was not being singled out.  If anything, taking on the LDI </p><p>would be a political plus for the GOK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Dr. Mohammed assured the Ambassador that he would do </p><p>his best to "get to the bottom of this."  He asked the </p><p>Ambassador if the Kuwaiti hold would prevent the LDI from </p><p>ultimately being listed.  The Ambassador replied that his </p><p>understanding was that the GOK could delay the listing but it </p><p>was unlikely that they could prevent it, particularly since </p><p>Pakistan had now lifted its hold.  In that case, Dr. Mohammed </p><p>said, it made absolutely no sense for Kuwait to risk damaging </p><p>its international reputation as an opponent of terrorism.  He </p><p>would speak to Shaykh Sabah. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Ambassador also discussed the LDI case separately </p><p>with his French counterpart, Ambassador Claude Losguardis, on </p><p>January 22.  Losguardis said that he had discussed the issue </p><p>only with the MFA\'s Ambassador al-Awadi (IO A/S equivalent). </p><p>He added that the Kuwaiti embassy in Paris had presented a </p><p>dip note to the Quai d\'Orsay requesting that France withdraw </p><p>its proposed listing but that the GOF had found the note\'s </p><p>arguments "pas convaicante" (ref C).
