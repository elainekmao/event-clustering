THE CHINESE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN CHINA AS WELL AS </p><p>OBSERVANCE OF THE "ONE CHINA" POLICY.  THEY TOOK SOME HEAT </p><p>FROM DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FINI ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.  ON HIS TRIP TO CHINA, </p><p>THE GOI MINISTER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A LARGE PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>DELEGATION.  HIS OBJECTIVES, AND THOSE OF THE UNDERSECRETARY, </p><p>WERE TO FIND EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES, OBTAIN PR FOR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>AID, AND SMOOTH OVER SYMBOLIC ISSUES OF CONTENTION, SUCH AS </p><p>CONTACT WITH TAIWANESE OFFICIALS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p>LI LANQING IN ROME:  LET\'S DEEPEN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TIES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) ACCORDING TO RENZO MARIO ROSSI, OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>EAST ASIAN AFFAIRS, AND HIS DEPUTY, PAOLA MUNZI, DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER LI LANQING WAS THE FIRST RANKING CHINESE OFFICIAL TO </p><p>VISIT ITALY UNDER THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT.  LANQING AND HIS </p><p>DELEGATION, WHICH INCLUDED THE MINISTER OF CULTURE, DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, AND OTHERS, MET WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT CIAMPI, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FINI, THE </p><p>INTERNATIONALIZATION REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CONFINDUSTRIA </p><p>EMPLOYERS\' ASSOCIATION, AND THE HEAD OF THE CHAMBER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03384  01 OF 03  101003Z </p><p>DEPUTIES\' FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE DURING THEIR MAY 21-25 </p><p>VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) FINI THANKED CHINA FOR ITS COOPERATION AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM, ILLEGAL MIGRATION, AND TRANSNATIONAL CRIME. </p><p>(NOTE:  RECENTLY-RESIGNED INTERIOR MINISTER SCAJOLA HAD </p><p>SIGNED A TRANSNATIONAL CRIME AGREEMENT WITH CHINA A FEW </p><p>MONTHS BEFORE.  END NOTE.)  LANQING ASSERTED THAT THE GOI AND </p><p>PRC AGREED ON STRATEGIC ISSUES, THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL </p><p>INCLUSION/DIVERSITY IN THE WORLD, AND GLOBAL "ECONOMIC </p><p>BALANCE" IN A "MULTI-POLAR WORLD."  HE INVITED CIAMPI AND </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI TO VISIT CHINA NEXT SPRING AFTER </p><p>THE CONCLUSION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>OCTOBER.  FINI NOTED THAT THE GOI AND PRC SHARED SIMILAR </p><p>VIEWS ON THE REFORM OF THE UNSC MEMBERSHIP.  (NOTE:  ITALY\'S </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR UNSC REFORM IS TO ADD EIGHT-TEN REGIONAL, </p><p>NON-PERMANENT SEATS THAT WOULD BE SHARED BY </p><p>COUNTRIES--ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO UN </p><p>ACTIVITIES--NOT REPRESENTED IN OTHER SLOTS.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.    (U) LANQING PROPOSED THAT CHINA AND ITALY (1) INTENSIFY </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT CONTACTS, (2) BROADEN ECONOMIC TIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY BETWEEN SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (SMES), </p><p>AND (3) INCREASE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL EXCHANGES.  CHINA </p><p>IS INTERESTED IN THE ITALIAN SME MODEL AND HOPES THAT TRADE </p><p>AND JOINT VENTURES WITH ITALIAN COMPANIES EXPAND. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>LANQING:  BUT MUST YOU CODDLE ENEMIES OF STATE? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03384  01 OF 03  101003Z </p><p>5.    (C) SUGGESTING THAT THEY NOT LET POINTS OF DISAGREEMENT </p><p>RUIN THEIR RELATIONSHIP, LANQING THANKED THE GOI FOR ITS ONE </p><p>CHINA POLICY AND EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE </p><p>REUNIFICATION OF CHINA.  THE PRC WAS WILLING TO BE MORE </p><p>FLEXIBLE TOWARD TAIWAN (WHICH COULD MAINTAIN ITS OWN SOCIAL </p><p>AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND ARMED FORCES, BE REPRESENTED IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT, AND NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE MAINLAND) BUT ONLY IN </p><p>A ONE CHINA FRAMEWORK.  THE GOI NOTED THAT ITS </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS WERE INDEPENDENT AND THAT IT WAS LEGALLY </p><p>OBLIGATED TO ALLOW TAIWANESE OFFICIALS TO TRANSIT ITALY IN </p><p>ORDER TO VISIT THE VATICAN.  LANQING DISAGREED WITH THIS </p><p>RATIONALE, STATING THAT THE TAIWANESE\'S REAL INTENTION IN </p><p>OBTAINING TRANSIT VISAS WAS TO INCREASE CONTACT WITH THE GOI. </p><p> (ROSSI AND MUNZI EXPLAINED THAT IN A RECENT VISIT OF WHICH </p><p>THE PRC HAD COMPLAINED, TAIWANESE OFFICIALS MET IN A PRIVATE </p><p>DINNER WITH A PARLIAMENTARY GROUP.  SUCH VISITS WERE A </p><p>CONTINUAL CONCERN TO THE MFA.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE TAIWANESE </p><p>PRESIDENT HAD REQUESTED A VISIT IN JUNE, AND THE GOI WAS </p><p>UNSURE HOW TO RESPOND.  ON THE ONE HAND, TAIWAN\'S FRIENDS </p><p>LOBBY THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE PARLIAMENT EXPRESSES INTEREST </p><p>IN ALLOWING SUCH VISITS, WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PRC </p><p>PRESSES FOR VISA REFUSAL.  TAIWAN WAS AN ESPECIALLY HOT ISSUE </p><p>FOR THE PRC BECAUSE OF THE MAINLAND\'S UPCOMING PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, THE MFA REP SURMISED.  THE GOI HAD FEARED THAT </p><p>CHINESE DISPLEASURE ON THIS ISSUE COULD HURT ITALIAN EXPORTS, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8012 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03384  02 OF 03  101003Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   C-00     DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXIM-01  OIGO-00  E-00     FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00    EPAE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------C90210  101004Z /38 </p><p>R 101011Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 4727 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>CIA WASHINGTON DC//CIC/CTC// </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 003384 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EAID, IT, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY AND CHINA EXCHANGE VISITS TO PROMOTE </p><p>ECONOMIC INTERESTS, DISCUSS REGIONAL PROBLEMS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03384  02 OF 03  101003Z </p><p>BUT HAD ALSO NOTICED THERE WERE NO SIGNS THAT COUNTRIES THAT </p><p>RECEIVED THE DALAI LAMA, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE SO PUNISHED.) </p><p> </p><p>6.    (C) ON OTHER TOUCHY ISSUES, LANQING WAS PREDICTABLY </p><p>NON-FORTHCOMING.  ON TIBET, HE SAID THAT THE PRC WAS PREPARED </p><p>TO PROVIDE A HIGH DEGREE OF AUTONOMY, BUT THE PROBLEM WAS </p><p>THAT THE DALAI LAMA WANTED THE INDEPENDENCE OF TIBET AND </p><p>TAIWAN.  LANQING WENT ON TO CLAIM THAT THE FALUN GONG (FG) </p><p>WAS A TERRORIST GROUP THAT PROMOTED SUICIDE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE MFA, THIS REMARK WAS AN ATTEMPT TO HEAD OFF GOI </p><p>CRITICISM, SINCE A NUMBER OF ITALIAN BUSINESSMEN MARRIED TO </p><p>CHINESE NATIONALS ARE FG MEMBERS.  THE GOI BELIEVES THAT FG </p><p>IS PEACEFUL AND NON-SUICIDAL, AND FINI TOLD LANQING THAT IT </p><p>WAS NOT THE GOI\'S HABIT TO JUDGE THINGS ABOUT WHICH IT HAD NO </p><p>EVIDENCE (I.E., FG\'S CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES), BUT THAT RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM MUST BE REAL.  FINI ALSO PRESSED FOR A RESOLUTION OF </p><p>THE SCHISM BETWEEN THE NATIONALIST AND CLANDESTINE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCHES.  FINALLY, HE NOTED THAT ITALY\'S POLICIES ON TAIWAN, </p><p>TIBET, AND HUMAN RIGHTS REFLECT AGREED EU POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>ITALY GOES TO CHINA </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.    (SBU) BACK-TO-BACK TRIPS TO CHINA BY SENIOR GOI </p><p>OFFICIALS REFLECTED LARGELY THE PRO-BUSINESS BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S EMPHASIS ON PROMOTING ITALIAN EXPORTS.  THE </p><p>MISSIONS ALSO STEMMED FROM THE IMPETUS OF THE </p><p>INTER-MINISTERIAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR GROUP ON CHINA, WHICH </p><p>WAS ESTABLISHED ONE YEAR AGO.  (NOTE:  ITALIAN EXPORTS TO </p><p>CHINA HAVE INCREASED CONSIDERABLY AS OF LATE, BUT THEY ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03384  02 OF 03  101003Z </p><p>STILL A TINY FRACTION OF ITALY\'S TOTAL EXPORTS.  THIS GROUP </p><p>HAS ASKED THE GOI TO ESTABLISH A FUND FOR COMPANIES THAT WANT </p><p>TO INVEST IN CHINA IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE BENEFIT-TO-RISK </p><p>RATIO.  THE IDEA, CONSIDERED CORPORATE WELFARE BY SOME, IS </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>8.    (C) ANTONIO MARZANO, MINISTER FOR PRODUCTIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES, WAS ACCOMPANIED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR AND OF CONFINDUSTRIA, ITALY\'S LARGEST EMPLOYER </p><p>ASSOCIATION, ON HIS JUNE 12-13 VISIT.  THEIR MAIN GOAL WAS TO </p><p>ESTABLISH CONTACTS FOR EXPORTING GOODS TO THE 2008 BEIJING </p><p>OLYMPICS, FOR EXAMPLE IN PACKAGING.  HOWEVER, MUNZI SAID </p><p>MARZANO\'S TRIP WAS DISAPPOINTING IN THAT HIS CHINESE </p><p>COUNTERPART WAS UNABLE TO MEET WITH HIM, DESPITE HAVING </p><p>AGREED TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>9.    (C) MFA UNDERSECRETARY FOR ASIA AND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>MARGHERITA BONIVER\'S JUNE 24-27 VISIT WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL. </p><p>BONIVER MET WITH MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TANG JIAXUAN AND </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTERS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, EDUCATION, FOREIGN </p><p>TRADE, AND FINANCE.  BONIVER KEPT THE EMPHASIS ON THE </p><p>POSITIVE, HIGHLIGHTING POINTS OF AGREEMENT AND THE </p><p>"EXCELLENT" STATE OF BILATERAL RELATIONS OVERALL.  DURING HER </p><p>VISIT, SHE SIGNED A COOPERATION AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDED 48M </p><p>EURO IN HEALTH AND TRAINING ASSISTANCE.  (NOTE:  MUNZI SAID </p><p>THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS NOT NEW, BUT THE TRIP PROVIDED A GOOD </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR A SIGNING CEREMONY.  END NOTE.)  THIS </p><p>INCLUDED THE SECOND TRANCHE OF A CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT TO AID </p><p>A HOSPITAL IN LHASA, TIBET.  SINCE TIBETANS COULD NOT AFFORD </p><p>THE HOSPITAL, AID MEANT TO HELP THEM WAS BENEFITING CHINESE </p><p>HAN SETTLERS INSTEAD.  ASKED WHY THE MFA DID NOT REALLOCATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03384  02 OF 03  101003Z </p><p>THE MONEY, MUNZI REPLIED THAT THE GOI FELT CONSTRAINED TO </p><p>DONATE AID ACCORDING TO PRC REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>CONVERGENCE ON NORTH KOREA, INDIA/PAKISTAN, AFGHANISTAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>10.   (C) BONIVER AND JIAXUAN FOUND COMMON GROUND ON REGIONAL </p><p>ISSUES.  ON NORTH KOREA, BONIVER NOTED THE PRC\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>INFLUENCE PYONGYANG TO LIBERALIZE.  JIAXUAN PRAISED THE </p><p>ITALIAN/EU APPROACH TO THE ISSUE, STATING THAT WHEN THE GOI </p><p>BECAME THE FIRST GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNIZE THE DPRK, IT </p><p>ENCOURAGED NORTH KOREA TO OPEN TO THE WORLD.  (NOTE:  THE GOI </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE DPRK IN 2000 UNDER A PREVIOUS CENTER-LEFT </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  END NOTE.)  MUNZI INFORMED POLOFF THAT THE EU </p><p>WORKING GROUP FOR ASIA\'S MONTHLY MEETING IN BRUSSELS WAS </p><p>CONSIDERING HOW TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM GOALS IN NORTH KOREA. </p><p>THE GOI HAD BEGUN A SMALL-SCALE AID PROGRAM THAT INCLUDED </p><p>SCHOLARSHIPS, TRAINING, AND VISITS TO EUROPE AND WAS </p><p>"BEGINNING TO PRODUCE SOME RESULTS."  A PROJECT IN THE OFFING </p><p>WAS A DATABASE TO COMPILE DATA ON THE ENERGY AVAILABLE TO </p><p>NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA.  THE MFA UNDERSTOOD THAT THE KEDO </p><p>AGREEMENT, EVEN IF WASHINGTON WERE WILLING TO SIGN IT AT THIS </p><p>POINT, WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE DPRK\'S ENERGY NEEDS. </p><p> THE SECTOR NEEDED EXTENSIVE REVAMPING. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO6795 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03384  03 OF 03  101004Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   C-00     USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00    PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------C90222  101004Z /38 </p><p>R 101011Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 4728 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>CIA WASHINGTON DC//CIC/CTC// </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 003384 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EAID, IT, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY AND CHINA EXCHANGE VISITS TO PROMOTE </p><p>ECONOMIC INTERESTS, DISCUSS REGIONAL PROBLEMS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03384  03 OF 03  101004Z </p><p> </p><p>11.

ON AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>JIAXUAN STATED HIS APPRECIATION FOR THE GOI\'S CONTRIBUTION TO </p><p>REBUILDING THE COUNTRY.  BOTH SIDES WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>WEAKNESS OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND AGREED THAT AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE, INCLUDING MILITARY, WAS NECESSARY TO </p><p>STABILIZE THE SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>SHANGHAI:  REPRESSION COULD BE WORSE; PICK US FOR TRADE FAIR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.
