<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000999 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR HINSON-JONES </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZER AND BYRNE </p><p>BANJUL FOR DCM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, NI, UNHRC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED ON NIGERIA\'S UNCHR VOTES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GENEVA 1748 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 586 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 964 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During a discussion with National Security Advisor </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed on President Obasanjo,s visit to the United </p><p>States (Ref C), Ambassador Jeter raised Nigeria,s voting </p><p>record in the UNCHR (Ref A).  The Ambassador expressed deep </p><p>disappointment in Nigeria,s voting record, especially after </p><p>the discussion between the Ambassador and President Obasanjo </p><p>(Ref B) had led us to believe that Nigeria would be more </p><p>forthcoming on issues such as the China resolution. </p><p>Moreover, the Ambassador inquired why Nigeria had broken from </p><p>the Africa Group to vote against the United States on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On Iraq, the NSA shrugged and said that Nigeria had </p><p>seen its interests as different from those of the rest of </p><p>Africa.  The NSA then stated that the GON recently set up a </p><p>committee to review its voting on UNCHR and other issues, and </p><p>mentioned the decay of Nigerian institutions, apparently </p><p>referring to the near moribund role of the Foreign Ministry. </p><p>He said that next year Nigeria,s voting will be based on </p><p>Nigeria,s interests, but to a large extent will consider the </p><p>views of Nigeria,s allies. (NOTE: The NSA appeared to be </p><p>implying that Nigeria\'s votes would be more in line with </p><p>those of the U.S.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: Notwithstanding his remarks on "next year," </p><p>it seemed that the NSA was not entirely familiar with the </p><p>major issues discussed in the UNCHR, and Nigeria\'s voting </p><p>pattern.  However, it is clear that Nigeria either does not </p><p>realize how seriously the United States takes the CHR, or has </p><p>calculated that it has more to gain by appeasing other states </p><p>and disappointing the U.S. than it would by voting with the </p><p>U.S. and losing favor with countries that President Obasanjo </p><p>has visited recently or plans to visit soon, such as Cuba, </p><p>China, Russia, and Iran. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We will continue to try to make clear the importance </p><p>of CHR voting to the bilateral relationship and to the notion </p><p>of a strategic regional partnership.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
