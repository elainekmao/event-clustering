<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 01683 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOLVING THE CHRISTIAN CRISIS:  THE PHALANGE </p><p>VIEW </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON MINISTER OF PTT </p><p>JOSEPH HASHEM MARCH 18.  HASHEM IS A PHALANGE </p><p>PARTY LEADER AND CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF PRESIDENT </p><p>GEMAYEL.  HE IS ON THE COMMITTEE OF THREE (WITH </p><p>KARIM PAKKRADOUNI REPRESENTING THE DISSIDENTS </p><p>AND MICHEL MURR AS THE THIRD MAN WITH LINKS BETWEEN </p><p>BOTH SIDES)  THAT HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH HAMMERING </p><p>OUT A SOLUTION.  HASHEM SAID HE HAD JUST LEFT A </p><p>PHALANGE POLITICAL BUREAU MEETING TO MEET WITH </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR AND WOULD SHORTLY BE GOING INTO </p><p>A MEETING OF THE THREE-MAN COMMITTEE TO FINISH </p><p>A COMMUNIQUE WHICH WOULD "REASSURE EVERYONE." </p><p>THE CHIEF ELEMENT OF THE COMPROMISE APPEARS TO </p><p>BE A RESTRUCTURING" OF THE PHALANGE AND THE LF </p><p>WHICH WOULD GIVE THE LF DISSIDENTS MORE OF A </p><p>VOICE AND MORE INDEPENDENCE.  HASHEM SAID THAT </p><p>THE  USG HAD CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY AND APPRECIATED WHAT </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN SAYING.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH PROGRESS ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL SOLUTION BUT NOTED IT SHOULD NOT COME </p><p>AT PRICE OF WEAKENING THE POSITION OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT, OR THE COHESION OF THE CHRISTIAN </p><p>COMMUNITY, AND THE COMMITTMENT TO REALISM AND </p><p>FLEXIBILITY IN THE POLITICAL REFORM PROCESS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  HASHEM ARGUED THAT THERE WERE NO MAJOR POLITICAL </p><p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE DISSIDENTS, WITNESS THEIR </p><p>OWN CONTACTS WITH SYRIA (A REFERENCE TO </p><p>PAKRADOUNI\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH KHADDAM OVER THE </p><p>LAST FEW DAYS.)  HE SAID THE PHALANGE PARTY </p><p>STRUCTURE HAD NOT BEEN REVAMPED FOR TEN YEARS </p><p>AND IT WAS NORMAL TO THINK OF RESTRUCTURING IT </p><p>NOW IN A WAY THAT WOULD GIVE THE DISSIDENTS </p><p>MORE PARTICIPATION AND POSITION, POLITICAL, </p><p>MILITARY, AND FINANCIAL.  THIS WAS THE FOCUSS </p><p>OF THE CURRENT COMPROMISE EFFORT.  THERE WOULD </p><p>PROBABLY ALSO BE A "NATIONAL CHRISTIAN COUNCIL" </p><p>WHICH WOULD BE A BROADENED LEBANESE FRONT REPRESENTING </p><p>ALL CHRISTIAN GROUPS.  IT WOULD BE ADVISORY AND </p><p>NOT "PARLIAMENTARY" (AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT </p><p>UNDERCUT THE PRESIDENT\'S AUTHORITY  OR SMACK </p><p>OF AN INDEPENDENT CHRISTIAN "CANTON".)  HASHEM </p><p>SAID THE CHIEF CONCERN WAS THAT THE LEBANESE </p><p>FORCE MOVEMENT THREATENED TO UNDERCUT THE </p><p>PRESIDENT, TRIGGER ADVERSE REACTIONS FROM THE </p><p>LEBANESE MOSLEMS AND FROM SYRIA,  AND UNDERMINE </p><p>THE EFFORTS AT REACHING POLITICAL ACCOMODATION.  HE </p><p>KNEW THE USG SHARED THESE CONCERNS AND THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>WAS MAKING THIS CLEAR TO "ALL SIDES." </p><p> </p><p>4.  HASHEM SAID HE THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS </p><p>HAD BEEN MADE IN THE THREE-MAN COMMITTEE.  HE HAD </p><p>BEEN DISCUSSING THE ISSUE JUST NOW IN THE SESSION </p><p>OF THE PHALANGE POLITICAL BUREAU WHICH HE HAD LEFT </p><p>TO MEET WITH THE AMBASSADOR.  HE WOULD BE </p><p>MEETING WITH MURR AND PAKRADOUNI UPON LEAVING THE </p><p>MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR AND THOUGHT </p><p>THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO REACH A COMMUNIQUE WHICH </p><p>WOULD "REASSURE EVERYONE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT SINCE HASHEM WAS SO </p><p>WELL AWARE OF THE USG VIEWS ON THE SITUATION </p><p>HE WOULD NOT REPEAT  THEM IN DETAIL.  HE HOPED </p><p>THAT HASHEM WAS RIGHT THAT THE LF DISSIDENTS DID </p><p>NOT DIFFER GREATLY FROM THE MAIN POLITICAL </p><p>LINES THE PRESIDENT AND THE CHRISTIAN </p><p>COMMUNITY WERE ON.  THAT SAID, MUCH OF WHAT </p><p>THEY SAID IN THE PAST, AND INDEED NOW, RAISED </p><p>QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER THEY WOULD SHOW THE </p><p>REALISM AND FLEXIBILITY REQUIRED TO PROTECT THE </p><p>NATION\'S  DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS STARTING WITH </p><p>THE CHRISTIAN PRESIDENCY, WORK POLITICAL REFORMS </p><p>WITH THE MOSLEMS, PRESERVE THE WELL-BEING </p><p>OF THE CHRISTIANS, AND CONTAIN SYRIAN INFLUENCE. </p><p>IF THE COMPROMISES BEING WORKED ON IN THE </p><p>THREE-MAN COMMITTEE BEGAN A PROCESS WHICH </p><p>WOULD UNDERCUT THESE OBJECTIVES, THEN IT WOULD MEAN </p><p>A PYRRHIC VICTORY FOR THE CHRISTIANS AND FOR </p><p>LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>6.  HASHEM SAID THAT HE FELT THINGS WERE ON TRACT </p><p>TOWARD A SOLUTION WHICH WOULD ASSURE EVERYONE </p><p>(INCLUDING THE MOSLEMS AND SYRIA) THAT LEBANON\'S </p><p>"POLITICAL SYSTEM AND POLITICAL LINE" WILL BE </p><p>MAINTAINED.  HE SAID HE WAS NEVERTHELESS CONCERNED </p><p>THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS AMONG THE LF DISSIDENTS </p><p>ESPECIALLY IDENTIFIED WITH ISRAEL COULD OBSTRUCT </p><p>THE PROCESS.  HE THOUGHT THE USG COULD HELP HEAD </p><p>THIS OFF BY GETTING THE RIGHT WORD TO THESE IN- </p><p>DIVIDUALS AND TO THE ISRAELIS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>REPLIED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THE </p><p>ISRAELIS WERE NOT A MAJOR FACTOR IN EITHER THE </p><p>GENESIS OR THE DIRECTION OF THE LF DISSIDENT </p><p>MOVEMENT.  DAVID KINCHE HAD YESTERDAY MADE </p><p>THIS PUBLIC AND UNDERSCORED THE LIMITS OF THE </p><p>ISRAELI    INTEREST AND ROLE IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING </p><p>INSIDE THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  IN FACT, THE </p><p>ISRAELIS HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>"RE-ENGAGING" IN LEBANON BY PLAYING A MAJOR ROLE </p><p>IN THIS FRACAS -- OR ITS CONSEQUENCES. </p><p>THE ISRAELIS ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT OF LEBANON, </p><p>AND NOT ON THEIR WAY BACK IN (HASHEM NODDED </p><p>AGREEMENT TO THIS LAST STATEMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  HASHEM CLOSED CONVERSATION BY REFERRING TO </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S UPCOMING MEETING WITH KARIM </p><p>PAKRADOUNI (ANNOUNCED OVER THE LF CONTROLLED </p><p>VOL.)  HE REITERATED THAT THE U.S. HAS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>INFLUENCE IN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  HE, THEREFORE, </p><p>THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT THE AMBASSADOR MAKE </p><p>CLEAR IN ANY CONTACTS WITH THE DISSIDENTS THAT THEY </p><p>SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE LEBANON\'S "POLITICAL </p><p>SYSTEM AND POLITICAL LINE", AND THAT THEY WILL </p><p>HAVE NO SUPPORT FROM THE OUTSIDE, FROM EITHER THE </p><p>U.S. OR OTHERS IF THEY DO.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID </p><p>HE HAD MADE THE USG VIEW CLEAR IN ALL HIS </p><p>CONTACTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENTS:  HASHEM WAS OBVIOUSLY TIRED FROM </p><p>THE UNENDING SERIES OF LATE-NIGHT MEETINGS THAT </p><p>HE AND ALL OTHER ACTORS IN THE MELEE HAVE BEEN </p><p>LIVING THROUGH.  HE DID NOT APPEAR SPECIFICALLY </p><p>ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE POLITICAL COMPROMISE THAT </p><p>IS SHAPING UP, AND CERTAINLY DID NOT CONVEY THE </p><p>IMAGE OF A MAN READY TO CLAIM SUCCESS IN PUTTING THE </p><p>GENI BACK IN THE BOTTLE.  IT WILL BE INTERESTING </p><p>TO SEE WHAT PAKRADOUNI HAS TO SAY IN HIS </p><p>MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR LATER TODAY.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
