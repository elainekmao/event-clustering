<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000764 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ISLAMABAD FOR SA A/S ROCCA </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  05-07-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, MOPS, CE, IN, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Retired Indian general in Sri Lanka to discuss </p><p>controversial Jaffna security zones issue </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 030259z May 03 </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 730, and previous (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  A retired Indian general has arrived </p><p>in Sri Lanka to discuss his report on ways to resolve </p><p>the controversial Jaffna security zones issue.  Even as </p><p>he stepped off the plane, there has been another dustup </p><p>over the matter, with the Tigers criticizing a </p><p>government plan to relocate military forces in Jaffna </p><p>town.  While there is some hope that the report can </p><p>bridge differences, there is also a feeling that the </p><p>Tigers do not want this issue to go away soon.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) RETIRED INDIAN GENERAL ARRIVES:  Retired Indian </p><p>General Satish Nambiar arrived in Sri Lanka on May 6 to </p><p>officially present his report on the controversial </p><p>military "high security zones" located in Jaffna </p><p>District.  (Note:  The security zones in Jaffna cover </p><p>roughly 18 percent of the land area.  The Tamil Tigers </p><p>have argued that the zones should be sharply reduced in </p><p>size and cited the matter as one of the major reasons </p><p>behind their recent decision to pull out from the peace </p><p>talks.  End Note.)  During his latest visit, Nambiar is </p><p>scheduled to brief GSL officials on his report.  A copy </p><p>of the report is also slated to be passed to the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for comment. </p><p>Joseph Pararajahsingham, a pro-LTTE MP for the Tamil </p><p>National Alliance, told us that he did not believe that </p><p>Nambiar would actually meet with the LTTE during this </p><p>visit.  He said he thought the Norwegian government </p><p>facilitators would provide the document to the Tigers. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) (((Note:  Per Ref B, Mission received an advance </p><p>copy of the report from GSL Minister Milinda Moragoda in </p><p>early April.  The text of the report was passed to </p><p>SA/INS via class e-mail on 04-08-03.  The complex report </p><p>advocates that the GSL and the LTTE agree to mutual </p><p>drawdowns of their military positions.  In doing this, </p><p>both sides would engage in confidence-building measures </p><p>facilitated by increased monitoring.))) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) (((Note:  In addition to Nambiar, retired Indian </p><p>Vice Admiral P.J. Jacob is also now in Sri Lanka.  The </p><p>objective of Jacob\'s visit is to advise the GSL </p><p>regarding ways to monitor LTTE sea movements in order to </p><p>avoid armed confrontations.))) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ARGUMENT OVER JAFFNA TOWN PROPOSAL:  Even as </p><p>Nambiar stepped off the plane, there has been another </p><p>dustup over the security zones issue.  The latest fracas </p><p>between the government and the LTTE involved a report </p><p>prepared by the Defense Ministry which provided that a </p><p>large chunk of Sri Lanka Army (SLA) troops based in </p><p>Jaffna town would relocate to a nearby fort.  The idea </p><p>behind the shift would be to free up space in Jaffna </p><p>town for civilian use (including in hotels where troops </p><p>have been bivouacked) while lessening the footprint of </p><p>the SLA in the area.  (Note:  Jaffna fort, where the </p><p>troops would move per the GSL proposal, is located just </p><p>to the west of the town in a less populated area.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Although the GSL seemed to be trying to go some </p><p>way toward meeting their demands, the Tigers sharply </p><p>criticized the government\'s proposal shortly after </p><p>receiving it from the Norwegian facilitators last week. </p><p>In a statement posted on May 1 by the pro-LTTE website </p><p>"TamilNet," LTTE political chief S.P. Thamilchelvam </p><p>rejected the proposed move, asserting that it was </p><p>woefully inadequate and counter to the February 2002 </p><p>ceasefire accord\'s aim of restoring "normalcy" for </p><p>Jaffna civilians.  Explaining his point, Thamilchelvam </p><p>argued that moving the troops to Jaffna fort was not </p><p>enough.  Rather, all the troops should be withdrawn from </p><p>Jaffna town and other urban areas as soon as possible. </p><p>Thamilchelvam demanded that the GSL revisit the issue </p><p>and come back to the LTTE with another proposal. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  There is some hope that Nambiar\'s </p><p>report can help bridge differences, perhaps allowing the </p><p>Tigers a public way to back down and return to the </p><p>negotiating table.  That said, there is also a feeling </p><p>that the Tigers do not want this issue to go away soon </p><p>because they see it as a useful tool to deploy in </p><p>hitting out at the government.  Thamilchelvam\'s </p><p>seemingly hasty and unreasonable rejection of the GSL\'s </p><p>proposal re the Jaffna town troop relocations appears to </p><p>back up this point.  Via his sharp critique, </p><p>Thamilchelvam also embarrassed the GSL, which had </p><p>absorbed sharp criticism from peace process skeptics in </p><p>the south in making the proposal to begin with.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
