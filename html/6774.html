<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001952 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, OPS CENTER </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, ETTC, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IMPACT OF IRAQ OPERATION ON KIRKUK-YUMURTALIK </p><p>PIPELINE </p><p> </p><p>Classified by EconCouns Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  BOTAS General Manager Bildaci told us the </p><p>oil flow in the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik (Ceyhan) Pipeline had </p><p>decreased by half and likely would stop completely by March </p><p>26.  Bildaci attributed the slow-down to the lack of oil </p><p>tankers transporting crude from the port at Ceyhan since the </p><p>start of Operation Iraqi Freedom, putting storage at Ceyhan </p><p>at near capacity.  A local shipping exec claims that shipping </p><p>brokers and traders know that the U.N. Oil for Food (OFF) </p><p>program has not been suspended, but are reluctant to offtake </p><p>from Ceyhan due to security and legal uncertainties. </p><p>Turkey,s state owned refinery also has decided not to </p><p>purchase Iraqi crude from Kirkuk for now.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BOTAS General Manager Bildaci told econoff March 24 </p><p>that, since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the oil </p><p>flow in the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik (Ceyhan) Pipeline had decreased </p><p>by half and likely would stop completely in 1-2 days. </p><p>Bildaci attributed the slow-down to the lack of oil tankers </p><p>transporting crude from the port at Ceyhan.  He said recent </p><p>average output of the pipeline had been approximately 800,000 </p><p>barrels per day (bpd), but had decreased to about 400,000 bpd </p><p>over the last several days.  Bildaci noted that within the </p><p>next 48 hours the 6.5 million barrel storage capacity at </p><p>Ceyhan would be full, and that no tankers had transported </p><p>crude from Ceyhan since March 21.  He added that one </p><p>important impact on Turkey would be the loss of transit </p><p>revenue from the OFF program, which he estimated to be about </p><p>USD 200 million per year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A local shipping company executive told econoff </p><p>March 24 that shippers, traders, and brokers were generally </p><p>aware that the OFF program had not been suspended.  Further, </p><p>he said, as of COB March 23, insurance underwriters had not </p><p>levied an additional war premium for tankers traveling in and </p><p>out of Ceyhan port.  Still, the exec said, shipping brokers </p><p>for the major oil companies and traders were reluctant to </p><p>offtake from Ceyhan due to the security and legal </p><p>uncertainties arising from the Iraq war.  The shipping exec </p><p>said he had spoken recently to Gulf Agency Management, a </p><p>large shipping broker in Turkey, as well as a large shipping </p><p>broker based in the U.K., both of which had decided not to </p><p>transport crude from Ceyhan at this time, although they were </p><p>aware that OFF had not been suspended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Turkey,s state-owned petroleum refinery corporation, </p><p>TUPRAS, told the press on March 20 that, although the </p><p>Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline had not officially closed, TUPRAS </p><p>would not purchase Iraqi crude from this source during the </p><p>war.  TUPRAS said for now it would pursue Black Sea exports, </p><p>i.e. from Russia, to replace the approximately 1.5 millions </p><p>barrels of Iraq,s Kirkuk crude it imports per month.  TUPRAS </p><p>General Manager Danis told the press he did not expect Turkey </p><p>to experience an oil shortage during the war, unless other </p><p>oil-producing countries became actively involved in </p><p>operations. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
