<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PREL, BM, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMESE GOVERNMENT CRACKS DOWN ON NLD FOLLOWING </p><p>RIOT NEAR MANDALAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) RANGOON 635 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 146467 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The Chief of Mission delivered reftel B </p><p>demarche to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and will </p><p>follow up tomorrow with the Deputy Foreign Minister and the </p><p>Minister of Labor.  In company with Ambassadors from Germany </p><p>and Italy and the British Charge, she also confirmed NLD </p><p>Central Executive Committee members have been effectively </p><p>placed under house arrest. She also visited NLD headquarters </p><p>and confirmed that it had been closed and sealed by the </p><p>regime.  Aung San Suu Kyi reportedly is returning to Rangoon, </p><p>probably in police custody.  Reportedly special facilities </p><p>are being constructed for her in Daukyant, on the outskirts </p><p>of Rangoon, where she may be held once she returns.  We hope </p><p>we are wrong, but it appears that the government is gearing </p><p>up for a prolonged period of repression.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Demarche Delivered </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Chief of Mission delivered reftel demarche in </p><p>written form to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this </p><p>afternoon.  Despite repeated attempts, she was not able to </p><p>reach any MFA officials to deliver the points orally.  We </p><p>will ask for meetings with Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung </p><p>Win and Minister of Labor Tin Winn (the former Burmese </p><p>Ambassador to the United States, who briefed reporters on the </p><p>situation on Friday) to make the points in person on Monday. </p><p>The British are doing a parallel demarche. </p><p> </p><p>NLD Offices Closed; Central Committee Members Under House </p><p>Arrest </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) With the Ambassadors from Germany and Italy, and </p><p>Britain\'s Charge\', the Chief of Mission attempted to call on </p><p>NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe and NLD Spokesman U Lwin, but was </p><p>turned away by Burmese police.   Nobody can enter or leave </p><p>the CEC members\' houses, and all of their phones have been </p><p>cut off, but the police refused to admit that that </p><p>constituted house arrest (or protective custody.).  The </p><p>Australian Charge\' was invited to accompany the group, but, </p><p>surprisingly, was instructed by Canberra to stay away.  The </p><p>Charge also confirmed that NLD headquarters has been closed </p><p>and sealed by the government. </p><p> </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi Returning to Rangoon </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to our police contacts, Aung San Suu Kyi is </p><p>on her way back to Rangoon.  The government offered to fly </p><p>her back, but she chose to return by car, spending the night </p><p>of June 1 in Taungoo.  Most likely, she is traveling in </p><p>police custody.  Reporters in Rangoon tell us that ASSK will </p><p>be detained once she returns.  In fact, signals point to her </p><p>being detained not in her own house, as on every previous </p><p>occasion, but in special government facilities in Daukyant on </p><p>the outskirts of Rangoon. </p><p> </p><p>Events in Depeyin </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Meanwhile, the government press has provided </p><p>additional details of the riot in Depeyin.  Apparently, a </p><p>convoy of about 40 motorcycles and 9 cars that were </p><p>accompanying ASSK were met by a crowd of about 5,000 anti-NLD </p><p>protesters as they arrived in Depeyin northwest of Mandalay </p><p>at 8 pm on May 30.  Fighting broke out when the NLD convoy </p><p>attempted to break through the crowd.  One vehicle </p><p>(apparently not from the NLD convoy) hit a tree, killing </p><p>four.  Another vehicle (from the convoy) ran into a ditch.  A </p><p>third (not belonging to the NLD convoy) was set on fire, </p><p>allegedly by NLD supporters.  Altogether, four persons were </p><p>killed and fifty wounded in the fighting and auto accidents. </p><p>None of participants in ASSK\'s main party were hurt, however. </p><p> Early reports that her vehicle was hit by gunfire also </p><p>appear to have been false. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The situation is serious. The turmoil that has </p><p>surrounded ASSK\'s latest trip has apparently alarmed the </p><p>government.  In any case, while its statements have had a </p><p>"more in sorrow than anger" tone, particularly in regard to </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi personally, its actions in placing the </p><p>members of the NLD\'s Central Executive Committee under house </p><p>arrest, in sealing the NLD\'s headquarters and township </p><p>offices, and now possibly preparing special detention </p><p>facilities for Aung San Suu Kyi, all suggest that we may be </p><p>in for a prolonged bout of repression. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) None of this bodes well for UN Special Envoy Razali\'s </p><p>upcoming visit.  To judge from its recent actions, the </p><p>government is done talking to the NLD.  Unless it relents, </p><p>there is probably little point in a new visit by the UN Envoy. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
