<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 000548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, PM, EB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PBTS, PHUM, PREL, PTER, ECON, PINR, ES, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HOSTAGE SITUATION IN NAHUATERIQUE POCKET ON BORDER </p><p>WITH EL SALVADOR ENDS PEACEFULLY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Roger D. Pierce for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  On February 25 at around 10:00am a Honduran </p><p>patrol comprised of seven police and four military personnel </p><p>was surrounded by approximately 400 compesinos in the </p><p>Nahuaterique pocket on the border with El Salvador.  The </p><p>incident occurred after the patrol had confiscated a number </p><p>of chainsaws that were being used for illegal logging </p><p>activities.  After a 27 hour standoff, and intervention by </p><p>both Government of Honduras (GOH) and Government of El </p><p>Salvador (GOES) officials, the incident ended without </p><p>violence.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) According to information provided by the Honduran </p><p>Ministry of Public Security, the Honduran Armed Forces, and </p><p>press accounts on February 25 at around 10:00am a Honduran </p><p>patrol comprised of seven police and four military personnel </p><p>was surrounded by approximately 400 people near the town of </p><p>Paso Mono, inside the Nahuaterique pocket on the border with </p><p>El Salvador.  Local residents also reportedly destroyed a </p><p>small wooden bridge (the only land route from Honduras) </p><p>thereby preventing the patrol from leaving without entering </p><p>El Salvador.  While the patrol was unable to withdraw, GOH </p><p>personnel maintained control of their weapons and after a </p><p>tense beginning were treated well by the local population. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The incident apparently occurred after the patrol </p><p>had confiscated three chainsaws which were being used for </p><p>illegal logging activities. On February 18, a similar patrol </p><p>had confiscated illegal logging equipment, which resulted in </p><p>a minor scuffle with local residents.  The community, made up </p><p>largely of Salvadoran citizens who remained on the Honduran </p><p>side of the border after the 1992 International Court of </p><p>Justice ruling, has reportedly traditionally made its </p><p>livelihood from logging activities.  Recent efforts to </p><p>enforce Honduran law in the area have meet with considerable </p><p>opposition due to the fact that other means of income are </p><p>very limited. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The informal leader of the community, Santos Tulio </p><p>Hernandez, is reportedly a former member of the Ejercito </p><p>Revolutionario Popular, one of the strongest elements of the </p><p>FMLN that operated in the Perquin-Torola area. Many of the </p><p>residents in the surrounding area were also apparently </p><p>guerrilla sympathizers in the 1980\'s.  After preventing the </p><p>patrol from leaving, Hernandez demanded discussions with both </p><p>GOH and GOES officials concerning the community\'s grievances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On February 26, a GOH/GOES bilateral commission met </p><p>in the town of Zancudo, Honduras to address the villagers </p><p>demands and secure the release of the 11 patrol members. </p><p>Taking part in the discussions were Honduran Police </p><p>Commissioner Coralia Rivera, local military commanders, and </p><p>representatives from both the GOH and GOES foreign </p><p>ministries.  Sources report that officials involved in the </p><p>mediation effort were able to secure the release of the </p><p>patrol around noon after promising to address the community\'s </p><p>needs. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Many of the residents of Nahuaterique, although now </p><p>officially living in Honduras, remain citizens of El Salvador </p><p>and continue to hold strong cultural and family ties to El </p><p>Salvador.  Most local transportation is provided by El </p><p>Salvador, villagers do most of their shopping in El Salvador, </p><p>and El Salvador continues to be a large market for Honduran </p><p>lumber. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  This incident highlights the need for </p><p>demarcation of the border between the two countries. </p><p>Honduras can be expected to use this incident to push for </p><p>quicker action in this area.  Honduran authorities are also </p><p>likely to attempt to assert greater control of the area </p><p>through a larger official presence. The GOH will find it </p><p>difficult, however, to enforce anti-logging in this poor </p><p>region where Honduran law has not been regularly enforced. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
