<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001325 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>KUWAIT FOR TODD SCHWARTZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SENV, ECON, CA, Manitoba </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA:  MANITOBANS GO TO THE POLLS JUNE 3 </p><p> </p><p>This message is a product of APP Winnipeg. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary.  Riding high in the public opinion polls, </p><p>Manitoba Premier Gary Doer (New Democratic Party -- NDP) </p><p>ended weeks of speculation by calling a provincial election </p><p>for June 3.  Re-election of the NDP government will keep </p><p>alive Canadian opposition to U.S. proposals seeking to </p><p>alleviate flooding of North Dakota,s Devils Lake via </p><p>drainage into the Red River. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Situated at the geographic center of Canada, Manitoba </p><p>has strong connections to the large agricultural component </p><p>and strong conservative/populist streak of its western </p><p>neighbors and also possesses the established industrial and </p><p>manufacturing sector and union movement found in eastern </p><p>Canada.  Within the context of Canada,s more "statist" </p><p>federal system, Manitobans seek leadership that will play an </p><p>active role in developing the province,s economic potential </p><p>and sustain strong social programs such as health care. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Politics at the provincial level have long been </p><p>polarized, with the left-leaning NDP and the conservative </p><p>Progressive Conservative Party (PC) overshadowing the </p><p>Manitoba Liberal Party, which has not led a government since </p><p>the 1950s.  The current government came to power in </p><p>September, 1999, in a sweeping victory that ended the 11-year </p><p>dominance of the Progressive Conservative Party. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) NDP support tends to be strongest in northern Manitoba </p><p>and north and central Winnipeg --  less affluent areas with a </p><p>high rate of labor union membership.  The PC generally does </p><p>well in agricultural southern Manitoba and Winnipeg,s </p><p>southern and western suburbs, which have tended to greater </p><p>economic prosperity.  Liberal Party support, though </p><p>relatively evenly distributed throughout the province, seldom </p><p>has been sufficiently "concentrated" to win large numbers of </p><p>seats. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Party divisions within the 57-seat Manitoba </p><p>legislature are relatively stable, with the NDP and PC </p><p>holding about 20 "safe" seats apiece, and approximately 15 </p><p>competitive "swing" constituencies determining the winner in </p><p>every election.  In the last contest, the NDP took nearly all </p><p>of the swing seats, including six with a margin of victory of </p><p>less than 500 votes.  At dissolution of the Legislature on </p><p>May 2, the NDP held 32 seats, the PC 24, and the Liberals 1, </p><p>a configuration borne out in the latest polls which show the </p><p>NDP leading the PC 44% to 30%, with the Liberals trailing at </p><p>21%.  With Canada,s first-past-the-post electoral system, </p><p>the NDP lead likely will translate into an absolute majority </p><p>in the provincial Legislature. </p><p> </p><p>Incumbent Advantages </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Gary Doer and his party hold a number of advantages </p><p>that make them virtually unbeatable.  In contrast to their </p><p>disorganized and under-funded opponents, the NDP started out </p><p>"debt-free" and now boasts a healthy (by provincial </p><p>standards) C$300,000 (US$213,000) campaign war chest. </p><p>Moreover, the government is credited for Manitoba,s strong </p><p>economy, the lowest provincial unemployment rate in Canada </p><p>(5.2%), and a balanced budget.  Nonetheless, the NDP seems </p><p>not to take anything for granted and has conducted an </p><p>aggressive media information campaign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PC Quick Out of the Gate with Tax Platform </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The PC, on the other hand, is starting from behind the </p><p>curve.  In his first election since assuming leadership of </p><p>the Progressive Conservatives in 2000, Stuart Murray launched </p><p>his campaign with a pledge to eliminate education taxes from </p><p>citizens, property tax bills and criticism of Gary Doer for </p><p>failing to provide tax relief despite a booming economy and </p><p>vastly increased tax revenues. (Manitobans pay some of the </p><p>highest property and income taxes in Canada).  Nonetheless, </p><p>Murray lacks voter recognition and PC fundraising efforts </p><p>have been significantly hindered since the NDP banned union </p><p>and corporate donations several years ago.  The party starts </p><p>the campaign with a C$400,000 (US$284,000) debt, no money on </p><p>hand, and opinion polls showing them 10 points lower than </p><p>their disappointing finish in the 1999 election. </p><p> </p><p>Liberals to Launch "Health Care Guarantee" </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Liberal leader Jon Gerrard launched his quixotic </p><p>campaign from a minivan disguised as an ambulance, to </p><p>emphasize the Liberals\' main campaign plank -- "a health care </p><p>guarantee," the funding of alternative patient treatment in </p><p>other provinces or even the U.S.  The platform is a challenge </p><p>to the NDP,s 1999 pledge to end "hallway medicine" and </p><p>reduce health care waiting lists.  Gerrard faces a struggle </p><p>to hold the lone Liberal seat in the Legislature - which he </p><p>won by less than 500 votes in 1999.  The Liberals start the </p><p>campaign debt-free, and with C$100,000 (US$71,000) on hand. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>9. (U) The NDP commands a resounding lead both in public </p><p>opinion polls and campaign funding. The anticipated </p><p>re-election of the NDP would not alter Manitoba\'s close and </p><p>strong ties to neighboring U.S. states.  At the same time, </p><p>however, it would strengthen Canadian efforts to quash </p><p>alleviation of North Dakota,s Devils Lake flooding via </p><p>diversion into the Red River or other similar means.  Doer </p><p>has resolutely opposed U.S. proposals to allow Devils Lake </p><p>water to drain into the Red River, and he likely will </p><p>continue to oppose those and other proposals such as the </p><p>"Northwest Area Supply Project," and inter-basin water </p><p>transfers. End Comment. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
