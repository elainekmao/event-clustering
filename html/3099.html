<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003009 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA/PPD; NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: JO, PREL, KPAO, ECON </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S BURGER KING PROUD TO BE UNAMERICAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  BURGER KING JORDAN IS LINING ITS SERVING TRAYS </p><p>WITH A LEAFLET IN ARABIC LABELING THE ORIGIN OF ALL OF ITS </p><p>HAMBURGER INGREDIENTS.  THE FLYERS DO NOT STATE SPECIFICALLY </p><p>THAT BURGER KING\'S PRODUCTS ARE NOT AMERICAN, BUT IT DOES </p><p>LABEL EACH INGREDIENT AS JORDANIAN, ARAB, OR AUSTRALIAN. </p><p>THIS LEAFLET IS ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW BUSINESSES IN JORDAN ARE </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO COUNTERACT POPULAR CALLS TO BOYCOTT AMERICAN </p><p>GOODS BY DEMONSTRATING DIRECT TIES TO THE LOCAL JORDANIAN </p><p>ECONOMY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BURGER KING JORDAN IS LINING THE RESTAURANT\'S SERVING </p><p>TRAYS WITH A FULL-COLOR, PROFESSIONALLY PRINTED LEAFLET WITH </p><p>THE HEADLINE "IT\'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU\'RE EATING. BUT </p><p>IT\'S MORE IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE SOURCE OF WHAT YOU\'RE </p><p>EATING."  THE LEAFLET INCLUDES A PHOTO OF A HAMBURGER WITH </p><p>EACH INGREDIENT LABELED ACCORDING TO ITS COMPANY AND COUNTRY </p><p>OF PRODUCTION.  WHILE THE FLYERS DO NOT STATE OUTRIGHT THAT </p><p>NO INGREDIENTS ARE FROM THE UNITED STATES, THEY DO DECLARE </p><p>THAT "BURGER KING JORDAN IS PROUD TO ANNOUNCE TO ITS </p><p>CUSTOMERS THAT ALL INGREDIENTS SERVED ARE LOCAL OR IMPORTED </p><p>FROM THE ARAB WORLD, EUROPE, AND ASIA."  THE LEAFLETS ALSO </p><p>ASSERT THAT ALL OF BURGER KING JORDAN\'S EMPLOYEES ARE </p><p>JORDANIAN, "PROUD OF THEIR JORDANIAN AND ARAB HERITAGE," AND </p><p>PROUD OF THE COMPANY\'S INVESTMENT IN JORDAN AND ITS PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WHILE THE INITIAL, FERVENT CALLS FOR THE BOYCOTT OF </p><p>AMERICAN GOODS HAVE SEEMED TO DIE DOWN, THE IDEA OF USING AN </p><p>ECONOMIC BOYCOTT AS A POLITICAL TOOL IS STILL DEBATED AMONG </p><p>JORDANIANS BOTH IN THE MEDIA AND INFORMALLY.  THIS WEEK THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT, ISLAMIST WEEKLY AL-SABEEL PRINTED A PRO-BOYCOTT </p><p>ARTICLE THAT OUTLINED THREE POINTS ON "HOW A MUSLIM FAMILY </p><p>CAN SUPPORT THE ECONOMIC BOYCOTT."  AT THE SAME TIME, A </p><p>RECENT PIECE BY THE INFLUENTIAL ECONOMIC COLUMNIST FAHED </p><p>FANEK IN CENTRIST ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY JORDAN TIMES AND IN </p><p>ARABIC-LANGUAGE AL-RAI OUTLINED ARGUMENTS BOTH FOR AND </p><p>AGAINST AN ECONOMIC BOYCOTT.  IT CONCLUDED THAT A BOYCOTT </p><p>WOULD ONLY HURT THE JORDANIAN ECONOMY WITHOUT IMPACTING THE </p><p>U.S.  THE LOCAL AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO HAS BEEN </p><p>WORKING QUIETLY TO EDUCATE JOURNALISTS AND OPINION MAKERS ON </p><p>THE POTENTIAL COSTS OF A BOYCOTT.  INFORMAL OPINION IN AMMAN </p><p>HAS CLAIMED THAT CONTINUED CALLS FOR THE ECONOMIC BOYCOTT </p><p>ARE STRONGEST AMONG THE YOUTH WHO MAY SEEK TO TARGET THE </p><p>MOST OBVIOUS SYMBOLS OF AMERICA SUCH AS FAST FOOD AND </p><p>CLOTHING OUTLETS.  EVEN THOUGH PUBLIC OPINION IS STILL </p><p>DIVIDED IN JORDAN, BURGER KING\'S LEAFLET DEMONSTRATES HOW </p><p>SOME COMPANIES MAY FEEL PRESSURE TO BE PRO-ACTIVE IN </p><p>RESPONDING TO THE BOYCOTT DEBATE. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
