<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002788 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 09/23/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SOCI, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO\'S THREATENED IMPEACHMENT -- </p><p>WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2763 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Efforts to impeach Obasanjo seem to be </p><p>losing steam, but the ultimate outcome still remains </p><p>uncertain. Many protagonists may not want to remove </p><p>Nigeria\'s President from office, but rather to weaken </p><p>him politically to the point that he fails to get the </p><p>PDP President nomination or voluntarily withdraw from </p><p>the race.  While constitutional issues abound as the </p><p>catalysts for current action, political machinations </p><p>drive events. When pulled into state-level political </p><p>disputes, Obasanjo typically stands with governors. </p><p>Many National Assembly members have concluded (often </p><p>correctly) that Obasanjo opposes their re-election. </p><p>Somebody has to go, and political survival drives the </p><p>current impeachment drama. Corruption and greed also </p><p>play as huge role. Obasanjo derides Nigeria\'s </p><p>legislators, and he has had little time for </p><p>cultivating them or attending to their concerns, </p><p>legitimate or otherwise. Obasanjo\'s foes feed </p><p>legislative anger.  While Obasanjo likely will keep </p><p>his job, he clearly will emerge from this </p><p>confrontation weakened and perhaps terminally wounded. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The National Assembly has chafed under </p><p>Obasanjo\'s imperial style, resenting his ability to </p><p>use Nigeria\'s long tradition of a strong Executive to </p><p>govern essentially as he pleased without having to </p><p>court their favor or pay more than cursory attention </p><p>to Constitutional requirements.  Obasanjo\'s operatives </p><p>openly campaigned for the removal of Assembly leaders </p><p>not to the President\'s liking, and they enjoyed </p><p>considerable success. Most Members were prepared to </p><p>ignore an overbearing Executive branch, as long as </p><p>they received certain perquisites (hefty allowances, </p><p>cars and Federal contracts benefiting them </p><p>personally).  But during late 2001 and into early </p><p>2002, Obasanjo took three critical steps that jolted </p><p>the legislators. First, he refused to implement </p><p>"constituency projects" of 500 million Naira per </p><p>Senatorial district. Second, he launched an </p><p>investigation and audit of National Assembly spending </p><p>and even dared Assembly Members to publish their </p><p>salaries and emoluments.  Third, Obasanjo transitioned </p><p>from a tendency to support governors in their frequent </p><p>disputes with senators and representatives into a </p><p>virtual policy of doing so.  The legislators saw their </p><p>chance to direct money to their campaigns and into </p><p>their pockets evaporating and Obasanjo turning more to </p><p>their adversaries, the already well-funded governors. </p><p>It all added up to one thing in their minds: Obasanjo </p><p>wanted to stop them from being re-elected.  Meanwhile, </p><p>Obasanjo\'s unsuccessful efforts to unseat Ghali </p><p>Na\'Abba had turned the House Speaker into an </p><p>implacable foe, and the once-pliable Senate President </p><p>had become bitter over Obasanjo\'s refusal to back him </p><p>in a power struggle with the Governor of Ebonyi State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Across broad swaths of the North and in parts </p><p>of the South, political actors dependent on Federal </p><p>largesse had grown increasingly concerned about two </p><p>issues. First, Obasanjo was not directing enough </p><p>Federal money their way.  Second, some Obasanjo </p><p>associates were discussing plans for a clean sweep </p><p>following the President\'s anticipated re-election; </p><p>there would be a concerted post-election attack on </p><p>crony contract awards and rent-seeking behavior. At </p><p>the same time, public annoyance over Obasanjo\'s high- </p><p>handed governing style was spreading from the </p><p>legislature into society at large, unhappiness over </p><p>steadily increasing prices was growing, and the </p><p>President\'s love of foreign travel was being ridiculed </p><p>in the face of his inability to obtain debt </p><p>forgiveness, the centerpiece of his foreign policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Influential players and especially antagonists </p><p>from the North began to urge a very willing National </p><p>Assembly to challenge Obasanjo -- to force him to </p><p>recognize their prerogatives and to play the </p><p>corruption game as it has always been played. Having </p><p>faced down all previous impeachment threats, Obasanjo </p><p>did not take this one seriously, refusing a list of </p><p>Assembly demands that notably included: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Addressing a joint session of the National </p><p>Assembly; </p><p>-- Replacing his detested legislative liaison </p><p>officers; and </p><p>-- Implementing the constituency projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Obasanjo soon regretted his hard line, as the </p><p>calls for his impeachment grew, and his backers in the </p><p>National Assembly dwindled.  In recent days he has: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Offered to address a joint session; </p><p>-- Agreed to replace his combative House Liaison </p><p>Officer; </p><p>-- Decided to hire more liaison officers so that each </p><p>of Nigeria\'s geo-political zones is represented; </p><p>-- Submitted a supplemental 2002 budget reinstating </p><p>the constituency projects; </p><p>-- Given a conciliatory Independence Day speech that </p><p>attributed the legislative-executive stand-off to a </p><p>communications gap; and </p><p>-- Submitted to the Assembly a bill that would resolve </p><p>the contentious oil resource allocation dispute by </p><p>eliminating the offshore/onshore dichotomy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Behind the scenes, Obasanjo\'s advisors have </p><p>embarked on a campaign to convince Assembly Members </p><p>from their respective states to drop from the ranks of </p><p>impeachment supporters.  Presumably, funds are also </p><p>changing hands to get key Assembly Members to abandon </p><p>the impeachment drive. The PDP National Secretariat </p><p>has also been active, but its interventions have met </p><p>with mixed success.  Former Heads of State Gowon and </p><p>Shagari and other influential individuals have been </p><p>enlisted to plead for Obasanjo to be permitted to </p><p>finish his term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) From meetings with numerous players in this </p><p>game, we conclude that the impetus behind the </p><p>impeachment threat is weakening but that its momentum </p><p>remains substantial.  While the number of House </p><p>Members supporting impeachment appears to have fallen </p><p>from just over the required 240 to something under it, </p><p>many senators and representatives will continue to </p><p>press for the President\'s removal, not because they </p><p>expect to succeed but because their own political </p><p>survival depends on weakening Obasanjo to the point of </p><p>becoming a political lame-duck, incapable of </p><p>successfully contesting for re-election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) One of the reasons impeachment will not succeed </p><p>is that it threatens the very fabric of Nigerian </p><p>politics, as well as the fragile unity of Nigerian </p><p>society.  The Yoruba Southwest, which voted heavily </p><p>for Obasanjo\'s opponent and co-ethnic, Olu Falae, in </p><p>1999, is now strongly behind the President. The </p><p>impeachment drive, whose symbol is Speaker Na\'Abba, a </p><p>Northerner from Kano, is increasingly portrayed in the </p><p>Southwest as a continuation of the 1993 election </p><p>annulment and Northern efforts to recapture power </p><p>without having to win an election (Vice President </p><p>Atiku Abubakar would be the Constitutional successor). </p><p>Fred Fasehun, a leader of the militant Oodua Peoples </p><p>Congress (OPC) recently stated publicly that </p><p>impeachment of Obasanjo was an impeachment of Nigerian </p><p>democracy that could result in the disintegration of </p><p>the country. Obasanjo\'s impeachment, Fashehun said, </p><p>would shatter Nigeria\'s unity. While Fashehun is prone </p><p>to hyperbole, the sentiment behind his statements </p><p>resonates in the Yoruba Southwest and may have gotten </p><p>the attention of the political elite. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Notwithstanding, many Northern political </p><p>leaders continue to express support for impeachment, </p><p>and Igbos clamoring for one of their own to be </p><p>President in 2003 have joined the bandwagon.  But for </p><p>neither of these groups is Obasanjo\'s actual removal </p><p>from office desirable.  That would turn the Vice </p><p>President, a smooth politician with plenty of money </p><p>and formidable machinery into an incumbent President </p><p>and complicate their calculations, which stress the </p><p>importance of an "open field" for 2003.  Obasanjo\'s </p><p>opponents will likely continue to inflict non-fatal </p><p>wounds, such as pushing various alternative candidates </p><p>to announce campaigns, in order to keep the President </p><p>off balance, under pressure and unable to regain </p><p>momentum in time to win his party\'s nomination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
