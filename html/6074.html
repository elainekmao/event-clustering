Although 264 lawmakers voted for the bill and </p><p>250 against, the motion was rejected for failing to secure </p><p>an absolute majority of 267.  19 MPs abstained in the </p><p>voting.  Dailies point to the fact that the number of </p><p>deputies supporting the bill was below the required </p><p>threshhold for a vote of confidence.  Prime Minister Gul </p><p>said on Sunday that the government would respect the </p><p>decision.  AKP officials view as unlikely the possibility </p><p>that parliamentary will take up to the issue again this </p><p>week.  Papers expect the AKP to wait for the by-election in </p><p>Siirt on March 9 before a new decree is submitted. </p><p>"Radikal" suggests that if the party opts to wait until </p><p>Erdogan is Prime Minister and a new government is formed, </p><p>disccussion of a new decree could slip to at least March 20. </p><p>98 AKP deputies either voted against the bill or abstained, </p><p>and the government is seeking to avoid further steps that </p><p>could increase tension in the party ranks.  The Siirt </p><p>elections will prove advantageous for AKP, according to </p><p>reports, because for the government will win a new vote of </p><p>confidence and gain time to see the attitude of the UNSC. </p><p>PM Gul said on Sunday that the bill would not be taken to </p><p>the parliament again unless Turkey is given guarantees </p><p>regarding the rights of the Turkomen and the weapons to be </p><p>given to the Kurds.  Monday\'s "Cumhuriyet" argues that the </p><p>motion was rejected due to the rivalry between Erdogan and </p><p>Gul, the negative stance of Speaker Arinc, and the NSC\'s </p><p>failure to provide guidance regarding deployment of foreign </p><p>troops at last week\'s meeting.  Some columnists see a kind </p><p>of parallel between the attitudes of Arinc and Gul.  They </p><p>blame the U.S. for refusing to concede in political and </p><p>economic negotiations, and for alienating Turkey from </p><p>debates regarding the future of Iraq.  They also note the </p><p>fallacy of Erdogan\'s assumption that he was in firm control </p><p>of the AKP parliamentary group, and his underestimation of </p><p>Speaker Arinc\'s influence in the party.  Comments stress </p><p>that the U.S. will not easily forget Turkey\'s refusal, and </p><p>many expect a gradual decline in Washington\'s support: The </p><p>Congress might shift to a hard-line position against Ankara, </p><p>and it will be tougher to stop initiatives like the Armenian </p><p>genocide issue.  The refusal of the motion has stripped the </p><p>Turkish military of a legal framework for an incursion into </p><p>northern Iraq, and Turkey is afraid that the U.S. will now </p><p>seek closer cooperation with the Kurds.  Observers claim </p><p>that TGS Chief General Ozkok and Prime Minister Gul explored </p><p>the possibility of an extraordinary NSC meeting this month </p><p>during Ozkok\'s call on Gul on Sunday.  Monday\'s papers </p><p>report Secretary Powell as saying that the U.S. will </p><p>continue its economic support for Turkey, as well as </p><p>consultations between the two countries about the future of </p><p>Iraq.  "Milliyet" says Powell\'s statement has eased concerns </p><p>in Turkey.  AKP leader Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that </p><p>his government is reviewing its options to allow U.S. troops </p><p>into the country, but did not rule out a second attempt to </p><p>win permission.  Erdogan said Turkey\'s relationship with the </p><p>U.S. is strong enough to ride out the problem.  Erdogan also </p><p>appealed to financial markets for calm on Monday.  Prime </p><p>Minister Gul said on Sunday that parliamentary refusal to </p><p>allow U.S. troops in Turkey would not damage friendly </p><p>relations with the U.S.  Gul also warned Iraq not to exploit </p><p>the Turkish parliamentary decision as encouragement to delay </p><p>cooperation with UN arms inspections. </p><p>Cyprus: Weekend papers report that UN Secretary General </p><p>Annan will meet with Cypriot leaders Denktas and </p><p>Papadopoulos at the Hague on March 10 to get their final say </p><p>about taking the third UN plan to a referendum on March 30. </p><p>If his proposal is rejected, Annan threatened to withdraw </p><p>from the Cyprus negotiations.  Although Annan said he has </p><p>received positive signals for a referendum from Athens and </p><p>Ankara, Denktas and Papadopoulos indicated they would go to </p><p>The Hague but would not accept the proposal.  Annan\'s </p><p>revised Cyprus plan, which envisions two founding states on </p><p>Cyprus, is regarded by the mainstream media a significant </p><p>step forward in favor of the Turks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq/Turkish parliament\'s decision </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The voting at the parliament" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in mass appeal-conservative Turkiye </p><p>(3/3): "The parliamentary vote is a reflection of the </p><p>national will, but we should not refrain from interpreting </p><p>the decision. . It is possible to sum up the criticism of </p><p>the parliament\'s decision as follows: The decision does not </p><p>reflect Turkey\'s future interests, nor does it shape a </p><p>perspective based on Turkey\'s future security requirements. </p><p>The government failed to enlighten the parliamentarians </p><p>about the facts.  The Speaker of the Parliament acted as if </p><p>he were the opposition leader.  The president made certain </p><p>discouraging remarks, and the National Security Council did </p><p>not take an active position on a very crucial matter. . We </p><p>were all caught very unprepared.  This decision will </p><p>certainly have an impact domestically as well as </p><p>internationally." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The decree crisis" </p><p>Hasan Unal advised in Islamic-intellectual Zaman (3/3): "The </p><p>parliament\'s decision deserves respect, but it is not exempt </p><p>from criticism.  Unfortunately, the AKP party board handled </p><p>the issue badly, and failed to control its own members after </p><p>carrying out an intense negotiation process with the US. </p><p>The parliamentarians should think of the issue in a very </p><p>broad perspective.  Their action will not be enough to stop </p><p>the war, and if Turkey stays uninvolved in an inevitable </p><p>war, it is to our harm.  Foreign policy should not be </p><p>formulated by ideological considerations, or by looking at </p><p>reaction in the streets." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey\'s decision" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (3/3): </p><p>"The Turkish parliament was asked for permission for the </p><p>deployment of foreign troops, while the people of Turkey </p><p>stand against the war by almost one hundred percent.  What </p><p>is peculiar is not that the permission failed, but the fact </p><p>that the request was brought before parliament in the first </p><p>place. . Turkey\'s decision enhances the values of democracy </p><p>and boosts hope for a settlement without war.  Let\'s hope </p><p>that now the US begins to think with common sense, and acts </p><p>under the principles of international values, human rights, </p><p>and the supremacy of law." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
