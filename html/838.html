<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ASHGABAT 002612 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/CEN </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA FOR USREP OSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  9/01/06 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PHUM, EAID, OSCE, TX, XG </p><p>SUBJECT:  USREP BROWN MEETING WITH MEMBERS OF TURKMEN </p><p>PARLIAMENT CONCERNING INSTITUTE FOR DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE TATIANA C. GFOELLER. </p><p>REASON:  1.5 D. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  ON AUGUST 30 US OSCE REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>SAM BROWN MET WITH THE TWO TURKMEN PARLIAMENTARIANS </p><p>DESIGNATED TO MANAGE THE GOTX\'S INSTITUTE FOR DEMOCRACY </p><p>AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- VLADIMIR KADYROV AND RASHID </p><p>MEREDOV.  AMBASSADOR, DCM, AND POLECONOFF (NOTETAKER) </p><p>ALSO ATTENDED.  KADYROV EXPLAINED THAT THE CLOSE </p><p>ASSOCIATION OF TURKMENISTAN\'S EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE </p><p>BRANCHES WAS INDICATIVE OF THE COUNTRY\'S "TRANSITIONAL" </p><p>STATUS.  EVENTUALLY, HE HOPED THAT TURKMENISTAN WOULD </p><p>SERVE AS A REGIONAL CENTER AND MODEL FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>REFORM AND MARKET ECONOMICS.  HE ENVISIONED THE </p><p>INSTITUTE AS PLAYING A STRONG ROLE IN THIS TRANSITION </p><p>BY PROVIDING "SCIENTIFIC" ANALYSES OF THE KINDS OF </p><p>LEGISLATION THAT PROMOTE DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  ARMED WITH THIS </p><p>INFORMATION AND FACTORING IN TURKMENISTAN\'S PARTICULAR </p><p>SITUATION AS A CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRY AND ITS </p><p>"OBLIGATIONS AS A NEUTRAL COUNTRY," PARLIAMENTARIANS </p><p>(WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF INSTITUTE STAFF AND PERHAPS, </p><p>OUTSIDE EXPERTS, AS WELL) WOULD BE ABLE TO DRAFT </p><p>APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION.  THE GOAL WOULD BE ACHIEVEMENT </p><p>OF CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL CODES CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>TURKMENISTAN\'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS, BUT TAILORED </p><p>TO TURKMENISTAN\'S PLACE IN THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) USREP BROWN RESPONDED THAT MANY BELIEVE THAT </p><p>TURKMENISTAN HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMITMENTS.  HE SAID HE ALSO HOPED THAT THE INSTITUTE </p><p>WOULD BECOME A CATALYST FOR DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT WARNED THAT PEOPLE WILL </p><p>JUDGE THE INSTITUTE AND THE GOTX BY THEIR DEEDS, NOT BY </p><p>THEIR WORDS.  NOTING THAT BOTH THE U.S. AND THE GOTX </p><p>WANT THE INSTITUTE TO BE ESTABLISHED AND THAT THE U.S. </p><p>IS PREPARED TO SEEK OSCE AND OTHER ASSISTANCE, HE </p><p>DESCRIBED THE TASK THAT LIES AHEAD AS "NOT </p><p>COMPLICATED."  NOW, "WE JUST NEED TO DO IT," HE SAID. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>OPENING REMARKS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) FOLLOWING HIS AUGUST 30 MEETING WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>NIYAZOV, USREP TO THE OSCE SAM BROWN DISCUSSED THE </p><p>INSTITUTE FOR DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS WITH THE TWO </p><p>MEN CHARGED WITH LAUNCHING THE ORGANIZATION -- MEJLIS </p><p>MEMBERS VLADIMIR KADYROV AND RASHID MEREDOV.  KADYROV </p><p>OPENED THE MEETING BY REMARKING THAT THE MEJLIS AND THE </p><p>CABINET OF MINISTERS HAVE OFFICES IN THE SAME BUILDING. </p><p>HE DESCRIBED THIS AS SYMBOLIC OF THE WAY THE TWO </p><p>BRANCHES WORK TOGETHER "IN THIS TRANSITIONAL PERIOD." </p><p>USREP RESPONDED THAT PRESIDENT NIYAZOV HAD SPOKEN OF </p><p>THE NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDEPENDENT EXECUTIVE </p><p>AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES.  HE EXPRESSED HIS GREAT </p><p>INTEREST IN SEEING HOW THIS DEVELOPMENT TAKES PLACE AND </p><p>WHAT ROLE THE INSTITUTE CAN PLAY IN THIS PROCESS.  HE </p><p>SAID HE THOUGHT KADYROV AND MEREDOV HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED </p><p>WITH A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>KADYROV\'S REMARKS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) KADYROV THEN LAUNCHED INTO A LONG MONOLOGUE ON </p><p>HIS VISION OF THE INSTITUTE.  HE EXPRESSED HIS HOPE </p><p>THAT IT WOULD HELP MAKE TURKMENISTAN "A MODERN COUNTRY" </p><p>WITH "A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY" AND A SYSTEM OF "MARKET </p><p>RELATIONS."  WITH THE AID OF THE INSTITUTE, AND </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH ITS "ADDED RESPONSIBILITY" AS A NEUTRAL </p><p>STATE, TURKMENISTAN COULD BECOME A "REGIONAL CENTER FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REFORM AND MARKET ECONOMICS."  THE INSTITUTE </p><p>WOULD SERVE AS A "SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CENTER" FOR </p><p>THE STUDY OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  IN </p><p>IDENTIFYING WHAT POLICIES AND LEGISLATION FOSTER </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS, IT WOULD TAKE INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT THE NATURE OF THE REGION.  HE ELABORATED, "WE </p><p>ARE PART OF THIS REGION.  WE SHOULD COOPERATE WITH THE </p><p>COUNTRIES AROUND US." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) KADYROV THEN OUTLINED THE PARTICULAR </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INSTITUTE:  (1) TO PROVIDE </p><p>"SCIENTIFIC" ANALYSES (2) TO DETERMINE WHAT LEGAL </p><p>CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY TO FOSTER MAXIMUM PROTECTION </p><p>OF HUMAN RIGHTS (3) TO DRAFT LAWS TO IMPROVE WORKING </p><p>CONDITIONS AND TO TRANSFORM THE ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>STRUCTURE OF THE GOVERNMENT FROM A (PARTIALLY) SOVIET </p><p>STRUCTURE INTO A DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURE (4) TO CONSIDER </p><p>WHAT STEPS THE GOTX NEEDS TO TAKE TO FULFILL ITS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING ITS OBLIGATIONS AS </p><p>"A NEUTRAL STATE."  ASSERTING THAT THE TURKMEN </p><p>CONSTITUTION ALREADY SAYS THAT THE MEJLIS SHOULD ENSURE </p><p>THAT TURKMEN LAWS ARE CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAW, HE STATED THAT THE MEJLIS IS ALREADY WORKING TO </p><p>RECONCILE ITS LAWS TO INTERNATIONAL LAW.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>U.S. AND EU EXPERTS HAVE PROVIDED SOME ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>THE MEJLIS IN ITS EFFORTS TO DRAFT COMPREHENSIVE CIVIL </p><p>AND COMMERCIAL CODES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) HE CITED THE DIFFICULTY MEJLIS MEMBERS FACE IN </p><p>TACKLING THIS ENORMOUS TASK:  THEY LACK STAFF TO ASSIST </p><p>THEM IN DRAFTING LEGISLATION.  INSTITUTE STAFFERS COULD </p><p>PLAY THAT ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>USREP BROWN\'S RESPONSE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) USREP RESPONDED BY RECALLING THAT BOTH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD INFORMED HIM </p><p>THAT THEY HAD SELECTED AS LEADERS OF THE INSTITUTE TOP- </p><p>NOTCH PEOPLE -- PEOPLE WHO COULD MAKE IT WORK. </p><p>THEREFORE, USREP STATED, HE FELT HE COULD SPEAK </p><p>FRANKLY, SAYING "WE KNOW TURKMENISTAN IS LOCATED IN A </p><p>PARTICULAR REGIONAL CONTEXT WITH PARTICULAR PRESSURES, </p><p>BUT TURKMENISTAN ALSO EXISTS IN A BROADER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONTEXT.  AND THERE, TURKMENISTAN HAS MADE COMMITMENTS" </p><p>-- INCLUDING IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS MEMBERSHIP IN THE </p><p>OSCE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HELSINKI ACCORDS -- "TO </p><p>GIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS TO PEOPLE, BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND </p><p>SOCIALLY."  THESE INCLUDE FREEDOM FROM ARBITRARY </p><p>ARREST, PROTECTION IN ONE\'S OWN HOME, AND FREEDOMS OF </p><p>MOVEMENT, OF THE PRESS, OF ASSEMBLY, AND OF SPEECH. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, "IN VIENNA MANY PEOPLE THINK TURKMENISTAN </p><p>HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS COMMITMENTS" IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AGREEMENTS.  "SO, HOW YOU DEAL WITH INTERNAL PROBLEMS </p><p>OF DEMOCRATIZATION, ALSO HAS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RAMIFICATIONS."  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S VIEW OF </p><p>TURKMENISTAN "DEPENDS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE </p><p>AGREEMENTS." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) USREP CHARACTERIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE </p><p>INSTITUTE AS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS FULFILLING </p><p>TURKMENISTAN\'S INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS.  HE WELCOMED </p><p>PRESIDENT NIYAZOV\'S ASSURANCES THAT THE INSTITUTE WOULD </p><p>BE INDEPENDENT, ASSERTING THAT THIS WOULD BE CENTRAL TO </p><p>ITS SUCCESS.  HE ALSO WELCOMED THE PRESIDENT\'S OPENNESS </p><p>TO OSCE ASSISTANCE.  BUT HE WARNED THAT THE PROCESS OF </p><p>ESTABLISHING AND RUNNING THE INSTITUTE "WOULD NOT BE A </p><p>PAINLESS PROCESS."  SOME WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY WANT TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO RESTRICT CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR EVEN </p><p>RESTRICT FREEDOMS TURKMENISTAN HAS ALREADY AGREED TO </p><p>PROTECT.  THE LEADERS OF THE INSTITUTE WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>GUARD AGAINST SUCH EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) USREP EXPRESSED HIS OPTIMISM THAT THE U.S. AND </p><p>TURKMENISTAN WOULD BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THE OSCE TO </p><p>FINANCE THE PROVISION OF EXPERTS TO ASSIST THE </p><p>INSTITUTE.  HE ENCOURAGED KADYROV AND MEREDOV TO STAY </p><p>IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE U.S. EMBASSY TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT "WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN IN VIENNA."  THE TASK IS </p><p>"NOT COMPLICATED."  BOTH THE U.S. AND THE GOTX WANT </p><p>THIS.  "WE JUST NEED TO DO IT.  IT\'S STRAIGHTFORWARD. </p><p>YOU JUST NEED TO GET STARTED." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>KADYROV AND MEREDOV\'S COMMENTS ON COOPERATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) MEREDOV STATED THAT NIYAZOV\'S IDEA IN DECIDING </p><p>(IN DECEMBER 1995) TO CREATE THE INSTITUTE WAS TO </p><p>FULFILL ALL THE OBLIGATIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION INHERENT IN TURKMENISTAN\'S </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED STATUS AS A NEUTRAL STATE. </p><p>IN THIS REGARD, THE INSTITUTE WOULD COOPERATE CLOSELY </p><p>WITH NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.  KADYROV CHARACTERIZED </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE EMBASSY AS GOOD AND COMMENTED ON THE </p><p>USEFULNESS OF THE NET PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDED </p><p>ASSISTANCE ENABLING MORE THAN 20 MEJLIS MEMBERS TO </p><p>TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATES AND TO BECOME "ACQUAINTED </p><p>WITH INTERNATIONAL LAWS."  AMBASSADOR INTERJECTED THAT </p><p>WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE ALONG </p><p>THOSE LINES.  HE SUGGESTED THAT KADYROV AND MEREDOV </p><p>ADVISE US WHEN THEY IDENTIFY COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN OR </p><p>OTHER KEY INSTITUTE STAFF. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) IN CLOSING, KADYROV SAID "SOON THE INSTITUTE </p><p>WILL BE OPEN, BUT THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE </p><p>INSTITUTE TO MAKE IT A REAL INSTITUTE WILL TAKE TIME." </p><p>HE PREDICTED "WE WILL HAVE LOTS OF PROBLEMS" IN GETTING </p><p>UNDERWAY AND WILL NEED "LOTS OF ASSISTANCE.  EVEN WHEN </p><p>WE ARE OPERATING AT FULL POTENTIAL WE WILL NEED THE </p><p>HELP OF THE U.S. AND OTHERS."  BUT, HE ADDED, "WE THINK </p><p>THE INSTITUTE WILL BECOME THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTE </p><p>IN THIS REGION" FOR PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>BUILDING DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>USREP BROWN\'S RESPONSE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) USREP GAVE A MORE MEASURED ASSESSMENT, SAYING </p><p>THAT HE THOUGHT THE INSTITUTE COULD BE A MODEL, BUT </p><p>THAT THE TRUE TEST OF THE INSTITUTE IN THE EYES OF </p><p>OTHERS WOULD BE WHETHER IT SUCCEEDS IN "CHANGING </p><p>TURKMENISTAN\'S CIRCUMSTANCES."  IF IT ACCOMPLISHES </p><p>THAT, IT WILL HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE; IF IT DOES NOT, IT </p><p>WILL HAVE NO INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>GFOELLER </p><p></p></div>
