<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002893 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>PASS TO USTR FOR ANDREA GASH DURKIN </p><p>FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/EPSC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PGOV, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: FIDE CHIEF NORMAN GARCIA TO BE NEW TRADE MINISTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) President Maduro has tapped Norman Garcia, </p><p>Executive Director of the investment and export promotion </p><p>NGO, FIDE, to be the new Minister of Industry and Trade, </p><p>replacing Juliet Handal.  He will be sworn in on October 17 </p><p>by Acting President Vicente Williams.  The GOH is also </p><p>creating a cabinet level task force, consisting of the </p><p>Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture, </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Finance Ministry, to </p><p>assure interagency coordination of ongoing trade </p><p>negotiations.  This Trade Negotiation Cabinet will be led by </p><p>Minister of the Presidency, Luis Cosenza. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Norman Garcia is a former Minister of Tourism </p><p>during the Flores Administration.  He has wide contacts </p><p>throughout Central America and in the United States.  His </p><p>English is excellent.  Since President Maduro\'s election, he </p><p>has worked closely with Vice President Vicente Williams to </p><p>develop the Competitiveness Council, and was instrumental in </p><p>bringing Michael Porter to Honduras earlier this year.  He </p><p>is a close associate of Minister of the Presidency Luis </p><p>Cosenza and Minister for Communications and Strategic </p><p>Affairs, Ramon Medina Luna (both former FIDE Directors as </p><p>well).  He does not have direct experience in trade </p><p>negotiations and trade policy, but he should bring a much- </p><p>needed strategic vision to the Ministry.   He is 58 years </p><p>old and has a degree in Industrial Engineering from </p><p>California State Polytechnic University.  Garcia has been an </p><p>excellent Embassy and AID contact for many years. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Garcia is well aware that Honduras needs to </p><p>accelerate its preparations for various trade negotiations: </p><p>WTO Doha Round, FTAA, Central America Free Trade talks with </p><p>the United States (USCAFTA), and regional customs union </p><p>talks.  We hope that we will be able to determine shortly </p><p>whether he will attend the upcoming FTAA Ministerial.  Both </p><p>USAID and Econcouns have spoken to Garcia and other GOH </p><p>officials about the need to complete quickly a National </p><p>Action Plan for Honduras for technical assistance in the </p><p>area of Trade Capacity Building, due on October 31.  We </p><p>understand (and hope to confirm shortly) that Garcia plans </p><p>to keep Vice Minister for Foreign Trade Irving Guerrero and </p><p>his new team in place.  SIECA consultant Alvaro Sarmiento is </p><p>continuing with his plans to provide rapid training to the </p><p>new employees in the Ministry; this assistance is financed </p><p>by USAID\'s G-CAP program. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment: It is a very encouraging sign that the GOH </p><p>chose to replace former Minister Handal with a trusted </p><p>member of Maduro\'s inner circle, rather than trying to </p><p>create a new government entity to conduct the USCAFTA </p><p>negotiations.  We also consider it encouraging that Cosenza </p><p>plans to lead the Trade Negotiation Cabinet and to keep it </p><p>small.  While other Ministries will need to be included and </p><p>consulted (especially Labor and Natural Resources) from time </p><p>to time, we believe this approach demonstrates that the GOH </p><p>intends to now give trade policy the attention it deserves. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
