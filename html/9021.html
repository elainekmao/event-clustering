<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001321 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EPET, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Fuel Strategies Amidst The Downward Spiral </p><p> </p><p>REF: Harare 01156 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  As noted reftel, multinational oil </p><p>companies remain in limbo as to whether they will be allowed </p><p>to sell fuel imported with forex at a viable pump price. </p><p>Industry sources report that the National Oil Company of </p><p>Zimbabwe (NOCZIM) will continue to bring in heavily </p><p>subsidized fuel for "strategic" users -- police, army, </p><p>health units, etc. -- while private motorists are left to </p><p>their own devices in a flourishing black market.  President </p><p>Mugabe is currently in Libya on an official visit, which </p><p>comes after months of crippling shortages and amid </p><p>widespread speculation that a Libyan fuel deal will solve </p><p>the fuel crisis.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Multinationals Search for Strategies </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Several sources within the multinationals cite a </p><p>recent meeting with the Ministry of Energy, in which an </p><p>agreement on financing fuel at a parallel market exchange </p><p>rate was "minuted" (but not implemented).  According to that </p><p>agreement, approved by the Deputy Minister of Energy on </p><p>behalf of NOCZIM, forex will be made available to the </p><p>multinationals at a parallel market rate, and the fuel thus </p><p>purchased may be sold at a floating Zim dollar rate based on </p><p>purchase cost.  None of this has materialized.  One </p><p>ChevronTexaco rep reports that his company awaits a "comfort </p><p>letter" from the Reserve Bank authorizing a purchase of </p><p>forex at the parallel rate (currently 2350:1) rather than </p><p>the official rate (55:1, or 824:1 for exporters and </p><p>preferred businesses).  Due to the constraints of corporate </p><p>oversight, reftel, multinationals cannot act without such </p><p>formal GOZ authorization. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Some reps from British Petroleum seemed upbeat </p><p>about their eventual ability to import under this scenario. </p><p>ChevronTexaco reps, on the other hand, cited the continuing </p><p>impasse as evidence that there is no political will to </p><p>address the situation -- at least while the GOZ holds out </p><p>hopes for a rumored Libyan intervention.  A NOCZIM source </p><p>recently reported through the DAO that the GOZ is reluctant </p><p>to enter into a two-tiered, subsidized/unsubsidized pricing </p><p>system, fearing that the inevitable leakage would make the </p><p>black market "uncontrollable."  While the sentiment is </p><p>noble, the black market is already the only source of fuel </p><p>for many private motorists. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Local press reports trumpeted a recent </p><p>breakthrough when they announced that private businesses </p><p>could henceforth obtain import licenses to purchase bulk </p><p>fuel with forex through multinationals.  In reality, this is </p><p>merely a form of official repackaging.  Private companies -- </p><p>including the US Embassy and other forex-paying customers -- </p><p>have long had the ability to import fuel through a </p><p>multinational broker.  One multinational rep noted that the </p><p>only revenue which has passed through his company for the </p><p>past month has been for fuel purchased by forex customers. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  This same rep indicated that they may convert </p><p>several of his company\'s established retail outlets to </p><p>"forex-based" outlets.  Most of the retail stations have </p><p>been dry for over a month. The only fuel coming in through </p><p>NOCZIM has been minimal allocations for official uses such </p><p>as police, army, public transport, etc., yet the empty </p><p>retail stations continue to bear all the costs of business: </p><p>salaries, rent, utilities, maintenance, security. Switching </p><p>even a few of the empty stations to members-only, forex- </p><p>based stations would at least recover some of the costs of </p><p>operation.  Given the prevailing black-market rate for fuel </p><p>-- anywhere between Z $1,500 and Z $3,000 (US $.64 / $1.27) </p><p>per liter -- many motorists would welcome a realistic </p><p>"market-based" price.  The legality of such a move would be </p><p>questionable; however, at least one ChevronTexaco forex- </p><p>based station has operated locally for several years.  If </p><p>such a station operates strictly via coupons, and restricts </p><p>access only to its members, it may be able to bypass the </p><p>official price controls and prove a viable strategy for the </p><p>short term. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Even the Indigenous Operators Playing the Game </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  One report which originated from an Embassy- </p><p>employed driver concerns Exor, an indigenous oil company </p><p>reportedly owned by Zanu-PF MP Webster Shamu.  The driver </p><p>noticed a fuel tanker unloading, and attempted to join a </p><p>growing queue.  The station\'s attendants began handing out </p><p>small slips of paper, instructing the motorists to go buy </p><p>fuel coupons -- for forex -- at a stipulated address, after </p><p>which they could return and try to obtain the fuel.  The </p><p>frustrated crowd became upset, then angry, yelling that the </p><p>(Zimbabwean) station owner should "take his fuel and go back </p><p>to Britain."  A squad of riot police was finally called in </p><p>to disperse the crowd.  Another Embassy employee reported </p><p>that a different indigenous station is already in the </p><p>business of selling fuel only through coupons -- but at </p><p>least this one accepts the local currency.  This employee </p><p>stated that "it\'s not even a secret, you go buy the coupons </p><p>-- 20 liters for Z$30,000 -- and you can get the fuel.  How </p><p>else do you think so many cars remain on the roads?" </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  All of the oil companies are facing severe </p><p>pressures from the continuing shortages, but the </p><p>multinationals are constrained even more by their corporate </p><p>accountabilities, which prevent them from taking actions </p><p>which clearly violate Zimbabwean law.  At least one -- BP -- </p><p>has been through a downsizing exercise to shed one-third of </p><p>its workforce, including senior managers.  Indigenous </p><p>companies -- which reportedly benefit from preferences in </p><p>obtaining supplies from NOCZIM -- have an additional moral </p><p>flexibility, in that they need not answer to international </p><p>codes of conduct.  Ultimately, those companies which can </p><p>hold out longest will do so, while those which see no </p><p>improvement in the future may well dump the local retail </p><p>assets and abandon the local market. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  Suffering even more than the suppliers, however, </p><p>are those at the end of the supply chain.  Commuters now </p><p>spend hours trying to secure transport to and from work. </p><p>Farmers -- any who continue to use tractors, fuel-driven </p><p>drying sheds, or other mechanized equipment -- have been </p><p>ground to a halt.  Businesses dependent upon diesel </p><p>machinery, transport or delivery services face spiraling </p><p>costs in doing business.  Some relief will be generated for </p><p>businesses who have access to forex and who can import their </p><p>own fuel through the multinationals.  However, this will </p><p>drive consumer costs even higher, and will widen the growing </p><p>gap between those businesses that can ride out the storm and </p><p>those that cannot. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
