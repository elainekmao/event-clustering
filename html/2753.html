LIBASSI </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED USG CONCERNS ABOUT GPS/GALILEO INTEROPERABILITY. </p><p>HE ASSURED US THAT MILITARY APPLICATIONS FOR GALILEO WERE </p><p>NOT BEING EXPLORED AND THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION DID NOT INTEND </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A REGULATORY REGIME THAT WOULD MANDATE GALILEO </p><p>USAGE.  LIBASSI ALSO DESCRIBED ITALY\'S INCREASING ROLE IN </p><p>GALILEO\'S DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING A 25 PERCENT STAKE IN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COSTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) POST DELIVERED GALILEO TALKING POINTS (REF) TO MIT </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR RENATO LIBASSI, WHO IS THE CURRENT </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT\'S GALILEO STEERING </p><p>COMMITTEE (GSC), COUNSELOR CARLO GUICCIARDI OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY\'S DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ASI </p><p>PRESIDENT SERGIO VETRELLA, FRANCO MARCONICCHIO, ASI </p><p>REPRESENTATVE TO THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) TECHNICAL WORKING </p><p>GROUP FOR GALILEO, AND RETIRED ITALIAN NAVY VICE ADMIRAL </p><p>GIORGIO CAPRA, THE FORMER GSC CHAIRMAN.

LIBASSI PROVIDED THE OFFICIAL GOI RESPONSE TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01848  121528Z </p><p>THE DEMARCHE DURING A MEETING WITH EST OFFICERS ON MARCH 29, </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) IN THEIR MEETING WITH LIBASSI, ESTOFFS HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>WASHINGTON CONCERNS REGARDING THE PROPOSED OVERLAY OF GPS\'S </p><p>MILITARY SIGNAL BY GALILEO, THE CREEPING EVOLUTION OF GALILEO </p><p>FROM A CIVILIAN-ONLY TO A DUAL-USE SYSTEM AND THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT THE EUROPEANS MIGHT CREATE A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT </p><p>WOULD MANDATE GALILEO SERVICES FOR USERS OPERATING WITHIN THE </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION.  LIBASSI NOTED USG CONCERNS, PARTICULARLY </p><p>REGARDING THE OVERLAY OF THE M-CODE.  HE ALSO STATED THAT </p><p>DURING THE EU TRANSPORT COUNCIL MEETING ON MARCH 25-26, THE </p><p>MEMBER STATES REITERATED THE FACT THAT THE EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMISSION (EC) WAS NOT COMPETENT IN THE FIELD OF MILITARY </p><p>COOPERATION.  HE ADDED THAT THE MEMBER STATES HAD AGREED THAT </p><p>"GALILEO WOULD NOT COMPETE IN THE MILITARY MARKET." </p><p>LIBASSI\'S MESSAGE WAS THAT THE TRANSPORT COUNCIL HAD BLOCKED </p><p>FOR NOW EXPANSION OF GALILEO INTO THE MILITARY SECTOR AND </p><p>THAT ANY CHANGE IN THIS DECISION WOULD BE COORDINATED IN NATO </p><p>STRUCTURES.  GALILEO\'S ABILITY TO ATTRACT PAYING CUSTOMERS TO </p><p>ITS FEE-BASED SERVICES WOULD BE BASED ON FREE MARKET </p><p>PRINCIPLES AND NOT REGULATORY MANDATES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) LIBASSI SAID THAT THE GOI DID NOT WANT TO GET OUT </p><p>AHEAD OF THE EU CONSENSUS ON GALILEO.  THE GOI WANTS </p><p>GALILEO/GPS COOPERATION AND U.S.-EU DISCUSSIONS TO RECOMMENCE </p><p>AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOI WAS CONFIDENT </p><p>THAT A U.S.-EU AGREEMENT WOULD BE ACHIEVED AND THAT THERE </p><p>WOULD EVENTUALLY BE A COMPLEMENTARY "CONVERGENCE" BETWEEN </p><p>GALILEO AND GPS, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE US AND THE EU TO </p><p>PRESENT A RANGE OF COMPATIBLE GLOBAL POSITIONING AND TIMING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01848  121528Z </p><p>SIGNAL PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) WHEN EST OFFICERS QUESTIONED GALILEO\'S </p><p>PROFITABILITY, LIBASSI RESPONDED PLAINLY THAT THE EUROPEANS </p><p>WERE PURSUING GALILEO PRIMARILY FOR POLITICAL RATHER THAN </p><p>ECONOMIC REASONS.  (EMBASSY COMMENT:  LIBASSI IMPLIED THAT TO </p><p>GALILEO\'S EU SUPPORTERS AN INDEPENDENT EUROPEAN GNSS WAS A </p><p>GOAL IN AND OF ITSELF.  END COMMENT)  NEVERTHELESS, HE DID </p><p>EXPRESS CONFIDENCE THAT SOME GALILEO SERVICES COULD PRODUCE A </p><p>RETURN TO THE INVESTMENT OF PARTICIPATING PRIVATE FIRMS. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, HE CITED THE PROVISION OF TIMING AND </p><p>POSITIONING SIGNALS WHOSE ACCURACY WOULD BE CONTRACTUALLY </p><p>GUARANTEED, WHICH COULD PROVIDE MORE LIABILITY PROTECTION TO </p><p>BUSINESSES USING GALILEO SIGNALS.  AT ONE POINT, HE ALLUDED </p><p>TO A POSSIBLE GLOBAL MARITIME AGREEMENT MANDATING THE USE OF </p><p>GLOBAL POSITIONING TRANSPONDERS ON ALL SEACRAFT AS A MARITIME </p><p>SAFETY MEASURE.  HE NOTED THAT ITALY\'S SHARE IN THE FUNDING </p><p>OF GALILEO HAS RISEN TO 25 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT </p><p>COSTS, WHICH MEANS THAT ITALY\'S PARTICIPATION IS EQUAL TO </p><p>THAT OF FRANCE AND GERMANY.  THEREFORE, THE THREE COMPANIES </p><p>THAT COMPRISE GALILEO INDUSTRIES (ALENIA, ASTRIUM (GERMANY) </p><p>AND ALCATEL (FRANCE)) WILL LIKELY GET THE LION\'S SHARE OF EU </p><p>MONEY IN THE ENGINEERING PHASE OF THE PROJECT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p>2002ROME01848 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
