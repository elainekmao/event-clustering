</p>
<p>S E C R E T  STATE 064278 </p><p> </p><p>FROM INR/DAS:DACLARK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:       IZ, IR, MOPS, MCAP </p><p>SUBJECT:    IRAQI MISSILE ATTACKS ON TEHRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOLLOWING IS A SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT ISSUED BY INR </p><p>WITH INFORMATION AS OF 0900 EDT 1 MARCH 1988: </p><p> </p><p>3.  IRAQ HAS ANNOUNCED A TOTAL OF 13 MISSILE STRIKES </p><p>AGAINST TEHRAN SINCE THE AFTERNOON OF FEBRUARY 29. </p><p>SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE CONFIRMS AT LEAST TEN OF THE </p><p>FIRINGS, AT LEAST THREE WERE TRACKED TO TEHRAN.  INITIAL </p><p>PRESS REPORTS INDICATE SUBSTANTIAL CASUALTIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THESE ATTACKS WERE PROMPTED BY IRANIAN FIRING OF </p><p>THREE SCUD MISSILES AT BAGHDAD THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY </p><p>28-29, WHICH IN TURN WAS RETALIATION FOR AN IRAQI AIR </p><p>STRIKE ON THE REY OIL REFINERY IN TEHRAN\'S SUBURBS </p><p>FEBRUARY 27. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OUR BEST GUESS, BASED ON EARLIER REPORTS OF IRAQI </p><p>EXPERIMENTATION, IS THAT IRAQ IS FIRING REDUCED-PAYLOAD </p><p>SCUD MISSILES.  THE ORDINARY SCUD CAN ONLY REACH HALFWAY </p><p>TO TEHRAN, BUT THE IRAQIS WERE CLAIMING TO HAVE DOUBLED </p><p>THE MISSILE\'S RANGE TO OVER 600 KM., WHICH WOULD JUST </p><p>MAKE IT TO TEHRAN FROM THE KNOWN LAUNCHING AREA NEAR </p><p>AL-AMARA.  IRAQ IS CREDITED WITH OVER 140 SOVIET-ORIGIN </p><p>SCUD SURFACE-TO-SURFACE MISSILES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  BOTH SIDES APPEAR TO HAVE DECIDED THAT US EFFORTS TO </p><p>OBTAIN A RESOLUTION TO ENFORCE UNSC RES. 598 AGAINST IRAN </p><p>HAVE STALLED.  THUS, THE RESTRAINT SHOWN BY IRAN AND IRAQ </p><p>UNTIL RECENTLY WILL INCREASLINGLY FRAY.  IRAN IS LIKELY </p><p>TO RESPOND WITH FURTHER SCUD ATTACKS AGAINST BAGHDAD AND </p><p>ARTILLERY SHELLING OF IRAQI BORDER CITIES.  THE IRANIANS </p><p>ARE ALSO LIKELY TO LAUNCH ONE OR MORE MAJOR GROUND </p><p>ATTACKS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
