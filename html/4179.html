(F) STATE 215837 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The GOB has provided a response to our </p><p>request for additional information on Burma\'s performance in </p><p>regard to the criteria set by the U.S. government for </p><p>certification of its counternarcotics efforts in 2002. </p><p>Included in the package are: </p><p> </p><p>-- statistics on all seizures of narcotic drugs and precursor </p><p>chemicals in 2001 and 2002; </p><p> </p><p>-- a status report on all cases prosecuted under Burma\'s </p><p>counternarcotics laws in 2001 and 2002; </p><p> </p><p>-- GPS coordinates for all Burmese eradication programs in </p><p>2001 and 2002; </p><p> </p><p>-- GPS coordinates and case details on all heroin refineries </p><p>destroyed in 2001 and 2002; </p><p> </p><p>-- A listing of all major seizures of narcotics and precursor </p><p>chemicals in 2001 and 2002 with names, dates, and map </p><p>references; </p><p> </p><p>-- Details on the repeated on-site visits made by U.S. and </p><p>UNDCP representatives to opium producing regions in Burma in </p><p>connection with the annual opium surveys done by both the </p><p>United States and UNDCP; and </p><p> </p><p>-- Details on the seizure and destruction of opium poppy </p><p>seeds in 2001 and 2002. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The entire package testifies to a strong effort that </p><p>was also documented in our first report (ref B) on Burma\'s </p><p>counternarcotics efforts.  Burma has reduced opium production </p><p>to less than one-quarter of its level in 1996; it has </p><p>cooperated effectively with the U.S. Drug Enforcement </p><p>Administration and the Australian Federal Police; it has </p><p>established productive cooperative arrangements with China, </p><p>Thailand, and other regional states; it has participated </p><p>effectively in multilateral arrangements organized by UNDCP </p><p>to curb trafficking in the region; it has enacted powerful </p><p>new money laundering legislation under which the first </p><p>prosecutions are already being prepared; and, working in </p><p>particular with China, it has curbed the activities of drug </p><p>gangs operating in cease-fire areas governed by the United Wa </p><p>State Army, the Kokang Chinese, and others.  Even the </p><p>reported decline in seizures of precursor chemicals and </p><p>methamphetamine tablets in 2002 is probably testimony to the </p><p>impact of Chinese/Burmese pressure on drug producing gangs </p><p>that are either being forced out of Burma or shut down </p><p>altogether.  Provided public order holds together here, we </p><p>also believe Burma could be one of the world\'s few outright </p><p>success stories in regards to narcotics control over the next </p><p>half decade.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) We have faxed copies of the GOB\'s latest report to </p><p>INL/AAE Director Bill Bach and EAP/BCLTV Desk Officer Josh </p><p>Glazeroff.  INL/AAE Southeast Asia desk officer John </p><p>Underriner also carried a copy of these materials back to </p><p>Washington.  The following is the essence of the report: </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Objective 1 - Drug Traffickers </p><p> </p><p>The GOB has brought more than 4,000 separate cases against </p><p>narcotics traffickers over the past two years; 2,592 of these </p><p>cases were prosecuted in 2001; 1,475 during the first seven </p><p>months of 2002.  Of all these cases, 172 were dismissed for </p><p>lack of sufficient evidence and 259 defendants were </p><p>acquitted.  The remainder (a total of 3,853 over the full </p><p>nineteen months) were convicted.  Six were given the death </p><p>penalty; 137 were given "unlimited" sentences; 10 were given </p><p>life sentences; 1,927 were given sentences in excess of 10 </p><p>years, and the remainder were given sentences of less than 10 </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Objective 2 - Eradication, narcotics seizures, and the </p><p>destruction of meth labs and heroin refineries. </p><p>Eradication: The GOB eradicated more than 50,000 acres of </p><p>opium poppy over the past two crop years.  Of this, 26,113 </p><p>acres were destroyed during the 2000/01 crop year; 25,862 </p><p>hectares during 2001/02.  It has also provided GPS </p><p>coordinates for verification purposes for 44 sites where </p><p>major eradication efforts took place in 2000/01 and/or </p><p>2001/02.  In addition, the GOB burned 164,000 kilos of poppy </p><p>seeds capable of seeding more than 40,000 hectares during the </p><p>six month period between April and October 2002.  According </p><p>to Brigadier General Kyaw Thein, the head of MI\'s </p><p>counternarcotics division, the destruction of those seeds, </p><p>together with continued pressure on the Kokang Chinese and </p><p>other cease-fire groups, should reduce the acreage under </p><p>opium cultivation by about half in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Monitoring and Verification Visits: USG and/or UNDCP </p><p>personnel visited every major poppy growing district in </p><p>Burma, including every township in Wa controlled areas, as </p><p>part of our opium survey programs in 2002.  Details on the </p><p>complete coverage afforded by the two surveys are available </p><p>in UNDCP\'s Report on its 2002 Opium Survey and the USG\'s </p><p>report on Joint US/Burma Opium Yield Survey.  The complete </p><p>coverage of the UNDCP survey, in particular, accounts for the </p><p>virtually complete agreement between the two surveys on the </p><p>current extent of opium cultivation and its steep decline </p><p>over the past five years.  Similar programs are planned for </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p>Seizures: Through October 2002, the GOB has seized 1,631 </p><p>kilos of opium, 285 kilos of heroin, 8,832,000 </p><p>methamphetamine tablets, and 226 kilos of cannabis.  For all </p><p>of 2001, the numbers were 1,629 kilos of opium, 97 kilos of </p><p>heroin, 32,439,000 methamphetamine tablets, and 284 kilos of </p><p>cannabis. </p><p> </p><p>Refineries: The GOB destroyed fourteen heroin labs in 2001 </p><p>and 7 thus far in 2002.  For verification purposes, it has </p><p>provided GPS coordinates on all of these sites.  It has also </p><p>provided details on 6 meth labs that were destroyed during </p><p>the first nine months of 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Precursor Chemicals: In 2002, the Ministry of Health issued </p><p>notification No. 1/2002 identifying 25 substances as </p><p>precursor chemicals and prohibiting their import, sale, or </p><p>use in Burma.  Seizures of precursor chemicals during the </p><p>first nine months of 2002 included 1,220 kilos of ephedrine, </p><p>2,908 kilos of acetic anhydride, and 21,552 kilos of other </p><p>chemicals.  In 2001, the totals were 3,922 kilos of </p><p>ephedrine, 12,318 liters of acetic anhydride, and 174,191 </p><p>liters of other chemicals. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Objective 3 - International Cooperation </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral Cooperation: Burma\'s counternarcotics cooperation </p><p>with China has expanded dramatically in 2002.  Details are in </p><p>ref B.  In the latest development, on October 15, Burma </p><p>arrested and turned over Li Kyin Kam to Chinese police </p><p>authorities.  Li Kyin Kam was reportedly a major trafficker </p><p>and fugitive from Chinese justice.  Burma has also resumed </p><p>its cooperation with Thailand, which has continued its </p><p>planning for a $400,000 alternative development program </p><p>opposite the Thai border in the vicinity of Tachileik. </p><p>Details of Burmese/Thai law enforcement cooperation will be </p><p>worked out at the upcoming HONLEA meeting in Bangkok. </p><p>Mekong Survey: Planning for the survey has resumed following </p><p>a resolution of the border tensions between Thailand and </p><p>Burma.  Burma has designated a group of 3 officials from the </p><p>Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control to coordinate with </p><p>Chinese, Thai, and Lao officials on the survey. </p><p>Ministerial Level Meeting: Ministerial level drug control </p><p>meetings between Thailand, Laos, and Burma have been held </p><p>every two years since 1992.  Burma will host the next. </p><p> </p><p>Cease-fire Group Liaison Offices: All liaison offices for </p><p>"national races," including all the liaison offices of the </p><p>United Wa State Army and other cease-fire groups, in </p><p>Tachileik, Myawaddy, and Kawthoung have been closed. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Objective 4 - Money Laundering </p><p> </p><p>The new money laundering law was passed in June; a Central </p><p>Control Board chaired by the Home Minister was established in </p><p>July; training for financial investigators was conducted </p><p>Rangoon and Mandalay in August and September; the initial </p><p>investigations were begun in October; and the first cases are </p><p>expected to be submitted to the court under the new law </p><p>before the end of the year.  Burma was left on the Financial </p><p>Action Task Force\'s list of non-complying countries in June </p><p>pending implementation of the new law.  Burma will be </p><p>eligible for removal in June 2003. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Objective 5 - Bribery and Corruption </p><p> </p><p>Action has been taken against 12 police officers involved in </p><p>five cases of narcotics-related bribery and corruption in </p><p>2002.  Four were given prison terms; one was discharged; four </p><p>were demoted; and three were given official warnings. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Objective 6 - Demand Reduction </p><p> </p><p>The Burmese government opened an additional 18 major drug </p><p>treatment centers and 22 drug treatment clinics throughout </p><p>Burma in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Final Note </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) In a meeting November 1, we passed on to General Kyaw </p><p>Thein the additional information requests (ref F) that had </p><p>emerged from the October 29th meeting in Washington and </p><p>assured him again, as INL Assistant Secretary Rand Beers had </p><p>assured him in Washington, that "other political issues" </p><p>would not play a role in the U.S. government\'s decision on </p><p>certification of Burma\'s counternarcotics efforts.  Kyaw </p><p>Thein pointed out that several of the new requests; e.g., </p><p>regarding implementation of Burma\'s money laundering law, had </p><p>been answered by this latest package of materials, but </p><p>nevertheless promised to reply promptly with whatever </p><p>additional information was available on Burma\'s efforts in </p><p>2002. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
