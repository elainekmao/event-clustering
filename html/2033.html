<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002521 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA ON FREEZING THE FINANCIAL </p><p>ASSETS OF TERRORISTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 165224 (B) ABUJA 2416 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action request -- see para 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Summary.  Emboffs met with CBN Deputy Governor Ebi to </p><p>discuss Ref A.  Ebi promised to re-examine the CBN\'s </p><p>mechanisms to combat financial crimes and crack-down on </p><p>terrorists\' financial activities.  The CBN\'s International </p><p>Financial Crime Unit has authority to investigate and freeze </p><p>assets and provides support to the national police for </p><p>arrests and prosecutions.  Financial crimes, however, do not </p><p>include money laundered from any source other than narcotics </p><p>trafficking.  An amendment to the Money Laundering Decree </p><p>would be necessary to overcome this deficiency.  Post </p><p>requests information from the Department.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. EconOff and RNLEO met September 27 with Central Bank </p><p>Deputy Governor Ernest Ebi to discuss President Bush\'s </p><p>Executive Order that enables U.S. authorities to crack-down </p><p>on terrorists\' financial activities per Ref A.  EconOff </p><p>presented Ebi with copies of the Executive Order.  Ebi </p><p>promised that the CBN would re-examine its mechanisms to </p><p>combat financial crimes, including strengthening </p><p>investigations into terrorists\' financial activities.  He </p><p>commented that the International Financial Crime Unit, within </p><p>the CBN\'s Foreign Operations Department, has the authority to </p><p>investigate financial crimes, such as 419 frauds, and freeze </p><p>accounts and assets determined to be involved.  It does not, </p><p>however, have the power to arrest or prosecute, he disclosed. </p><p> It might be possible, he said, to expand the mandate of this </p><p>unit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Ebi said there is a committee comprised of officers from </p><p>the International Financial Crime Unit, the Money Laundering </p><p>Surveillance Unit (also under the CBN), and the International </p><p>Financial Surveillance Unit.  This committee had proposed, </p><p>and may soon begin, issuing periodic reports on the findings </p><p>of its member agencies that would recommend specific actions </p><p>to be taken by the relevant Ministry, whether that be the </p><p>Ministry of Justice, the Central Bank or another agency.  Ebi </p><p>mentioned that the CBN had implemented a new policy in 2001 </p><p>whereby it would provide the national police with funding and </p><p>logistical support to facilitate financial crime prosecution. </p><p> As part of this program, the CBN also offers rewards for </p><p>successful prosecutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. RNLEO pointed out that the FATF designated Nigeria a </p><p>non-cooperative country in 2001, in large part because the </p><p>governing law, the Money Laundering Decree of 1995, had major </p><p>deficiencies.  The 1995 law only provides for the </p><p>investigation and prosecution of funds that have been derived </p><p>from narcotics trafficking, not for money derived from myriad </p><p>other criminal enterprises such as arms sales, trafficking in </p><p>persons or corruption.  Ebi did not appear to be aware of </p><p>this shortcoming.  He did, however, agree to look into the </p><p>issue.  Ebi said he would meet with the CBN legal department </p><p>and task one of his officers to write recommendations on how </p><p>the Central Bank could move forward with prohibiting </p><p>terrorists from accessing financial resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment and Action Request.  Even if the CBN were to </p><p>toughen its stance against financial crimes, these crimes </p><p>would not include money laundered from crimes other than drug </p><p>trafficking.  Moreover, the CBN will remain dependent on the </p><p>police or NDLEA for criminal investigations and prosecutions. </p><p> One action the GON needs to undertake to crack-down on the </p><p>financial assets of terrorists is to reform the 1995 law or </p><p>draft new legislation that would rectify this deficiency. </p><p>Also key to effective money laundering controls will be the </p><p>creation of a central GON office -- probably within the </p><p>Presidency -- to coordinate law enforcement action among the </p><p>many GON agencies and serve as a money laundering information </p><p>clearing house (a "Financial Intelligence Unit" as called for </p><p>by the FATF).  Post will work with the National Assembly, the </p><p>Presidency, Central Bank and Ministries of Justice and </p><p>Finance to encourage immediate action on this issue.  Post </p><p>requests Department to provide text of U.S. laws and </p><p>regulations governing financial crimes and terrorist </p><p>activities that might help the GON in promulgating its </p><p>prospective new law and regulations on this issue.  End </p><p>Comment and Action Request. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
