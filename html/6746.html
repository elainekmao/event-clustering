Ambassador </p><p>Wills will host a meeting next week among donors to </p><p>discuss conditionality. END Summary. </p><p> </p><p>1.   The UN and ADB reported on the Needs Assessment </p><p>Validation Workshop held in Kilinochchi last week.  It was </p><p>attended by 150 people, 50 of whom were LTTE, including </p><p>three LTTE consultants from Australia, senior central and </p><p>provincial level Government staff, NGOs and civil society. </p><p>There were numerous comments and strong disagreements and </p><p>at the end of the workshop there were a few difficult </p><p>issues that remained unresolved.  These included the </p><p>concept of blended or connected infrastructure development </p><p>favored by the GSL and self-sufficiency for infrastructure </p><p>development favored by the LTTE. Views differed also on </p><p>approaches to rebuilding (rehabilitation of existing </p><p>infrastructure where possible or replacement with state of </p><p>the art buildings).  A small review group of GSL and LTTE </p><p>consultants is redrafting the document but differences may </p><p>still remain. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Minister Moragoda said that the debate is one of Marx </p><p>versus Adam Smith and that the LTTE has a steep learning </p><p>curve. The LTTE appears to be responding on the basis of </p><p>its past experience where the majority of donor funds went </p><p>to Colombo. The Tigers don\'t want funds to go through the </p><p>central Government now because they believe that a </p><p>percentage will be skimmed off the top. Rather, they want </p><p>to retain wealth in the region and would prefer to </p><p>contribute as little as possible to the Center.  In </p><p>practical terms they want ADB money to remain in the </p><p>province with the design and implementation managed in the </p><p>North and East. The Minister said that the LTTE wants land </p><p>ownership patterns to change.  On the private sector </p><p>development side, he believes that investment in small </p><p>business activities at the grass roots level may help the </p><p>LTTE move in the right direction.  He asked for Japanese </p><p>assistance in this area. </p><p> </p><p>3.   The Norwegian Ambassador said that over the past few </p><p>months he had seen some movement in LTTE thinking, which </p><p>was initially focused on doing everything themselves, but </p><p>now the Tigers acknowledge that some outside technical </p><p>assistance might be helpful. According to Westborg, the </p><p>LTTE does not appear monolithic. While the LTTE still </p><p>believes that cooperatives are the way forward, it appears </p><p>open to joint ventures. Westborg said that while the LTTE </p><p>doesn\'t have as much time to go through the learning </p><p>experience as it would like, there is no easy way around </p><p>it and the GSL and donors need to be a little patient with </p><p>the Tigers. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Ambassador Westborg reported that at the most recent </p><p>peace talks, both sides had accepted the draft agenda for </p><p>the Tokyo meeting.  He repeatedly pointed out at the talks </p><p>that the GSL and LTTE need to move forward to create a </p><p>positive attitude among the donors leading up to Tokyo. </p><p>The message was received and understood.  He said that </p><p>significant political results will take more time than was </p><p>available given the Tokyo meeting date.  Progress was made </p><p>at the talks in that the LTTE welcomed local elections in </p><p>its areas, even multi-party elections.  Minister Moragoda </p><p>indicated that the LTTE wanted an expanded SIRHN, which </p><p>means a semi-permanent organizational structure. In </p><p>response, the GSL indicated that a clear road map with </p><p>milestones was required to consider such an expansion. </p><p>The road map needed to include units of devolution and a </p><p>plan for dealing with police and armed forces issues. </p><p>Minister Moragoda suggested that allowing democracy to </p><p>flourish at the grass roots level would create an </p><p>opportunity to pump money into local authorities. There </p><p>will be further discussion of the elements needed to </p><p>expand SIRHN at the next set of peace talks.   Minister </p><p>Moragoda said that they had discussed having additional </p><p>meetings between the formal talks as a great deal of </p><p>ground still needed to be covered. To this end, G.L. </p><p>Peiris will meet with Balasingham in the Wanni or London </p><p>and he (Moragoda) will also see Balasingham in London. </p><p> </p><p>5.   The GSL will hold a Colombo Seminar in preparation </p><p>for Tokyo on May 6.  A local think tank, the Center for </p><p>Policy Alternatives, has tentatively scheduled a pre-Tokyo </p><p>workshop for April 25 -27 for civil society. There was </p><p>considerable discussion as to whether the Colombo Seminar </p><p>would be an informational meeting or a consultative one. </p><p>One of the key factors is the timetable for getting the </p><p>documents for Tokyo ready.  The ADB rep has heard concerns </p><p>from colleagues that the process has not been </p><p>collaborative enough and that there should be an </p><p>opportunity to discuss the documents prior to </p><p>finalization. </p><p> </p><p>6.   The Washington Seminar Agenda was discussed and the </p><p>Ambassador reported that the invitations had already gone </p><p>out.  It was still unclear if Secretary Powell would make </p><p>an appearance and this may not be decided until the last </p><p>minute given world events.  Ambassador Wills noted that </p><p>while the topic of Conditionality for disbursement of </p><p>donor funds did not yet appear on the draft Washington </p><p>Seminar Agenda, this discussion might be added since most </p><p>donors thought it should be discussed.  The Japanese </p><p>Ambassador reiterated his previous position that the issue </p><p>is very sensitive and that it may not be appropriate as a </p><p>topic for discussion in an open meeting.  Ambassador Wills </p><p>suggested that he would host a private donor meeting on </p><p>conditionality next week, at which a consensus would be </p><p>sought on the way forward on this issue.  The USAID </p><p>Director reported that the development staff from a </p><p>significant number of bilateral missions had met and are </p><p>developing a paper on conditionality.  Once the paper has </p><p>been approved by heads of mission, the intent of the group </p><p>was to have the document shared with the GSL and the LTTE </p><p>to create a transparent and collaborative process.  The </p><p>ADB rep stressed that the paper needed to be simple and </p><p>practical.  The IMF rep indicated that there was little </p><p>chance of keeping the discussion on conditionality private </p><p>since it was pretty clear that bilateral donors would </p><p>raise the issue at the upcoming World Bank and IMF </p><p>meetings. </p><p> </p><p>7.   The Private Sector meetings which will be held </p><p>immediately following the Tokyo Donor Meeting will </p><p>primarily be an opportunity for Sri Lankan businesses to </p><p>meet Japanese private sector counterparts to further </p><p>stimulate foreign investment.  It does not appear open to </p><p>the private sector from other donor countries. </p><p> </p><p>8.   Minister Moragoda will be traveling extensively in </p><p>the next two weeks.  He plans to travel to Brussels to </p><p>have discussions with the EU and hopes to have separate </p><p>meetings with representatives of Member States. This </p><p>appears to be an alternative to the originally proposed EU </p><p>Seminar. The EU members will be voting on the issue of co- </p><p>hosting the Tokyo Meeting and the EU Representative </p><p>indicated that signs are all positive that they will agree </p><p>to co-host.   The next Core Group meeting will be held in </p><p>approximately 10 days time to fit into the Minister\'s </p><p>travel schedule. </p><p> </p><p>9. Comment: Progress is slowly being made. It is our hope </p><p>that donors can agree on conditionality so that it can </p><p>form part of the agenda both at the Washington Seminar and </p><p>at Tokyo.  We are troubled, as are other donors, with the </p><p>statist, autarkic and separatist thoughts expressed by </p><p>some LTTE\'ers at the needs assessment meeting in </p><p>Kilnochichi, but this probably constituted posturing to </p><p>some extent.  As the Norwegian Ambassador noted, the LTTE </p><p>probably doesn\'t have policies on many economic matters </p><p>yet.  This is both good and bad, good in that the Tigers </p><p>may be open to influence and reality, bad in that it shows </p><p>how far they have to come to meet the normally-accepted </p><p>criteria set by donors. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
