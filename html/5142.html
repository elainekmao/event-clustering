<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000071 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, BM, Human Rights, Ethnics, NGO </p><p>SUBJECT: BAD GOVERNANCE HAMPERS UNICEF\'S EFFORTS IN BURMA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA, a.i. RON MCMULLEN FOR REASON 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  UNICEF\'s $12m annual program in Burma is </p><p>striving to improve child welfare in a country where 35% of </p><p>children under the age of 5 are malnourished.  It has </p><p>achieved some laudable successes, but overall prospects are </p><p>severely constrained by an inept, illegitimate, and corrupt </p><p>military regime.  DCM participated in a UNICEF-organized trip </p><p>to normally restricted areas of Shan State January 9-12.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) UNICEF\'S EFFORTS WELL-RECEIVED IN SHAN STATE: </p><p>UNICEF organized a familiarization visit for diplomats to </p><p>Shan State January 9-12 to coincide with National </p><p>Immunization Day.  The group visited schools, rural clinics, </p><p>and administrative centers southeast of Taunggyi in townships </p><p>normally off limits to foreigners.  These rugged hill tracts </p><p>are populated by non-Burman ethnic groups, particularly Shan </p><p>and Pa-O, that have bridled at rule from Rangoon.  The UNICEF </p><p>group was everywhere warmly received by the local people, who </p><p>appeared genuinely grateful for UNICEF\'s health and education </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) JAPANESE AID EVIDENT:  The Japanese ambassador was </p><p>given something of a hero\'s welcome, as many nurses opened </p><p>nearly empty medicine cabinets in rural clinics to show </p><p>essential drugs donated by Japan in conjunction with UNICEF </p><p>programs.  At one stop a grateful health worker pulled up on </p><p>a Japanese-donated motorcycle, offering to give the Japanese </p><p>ambassador a lift to the next site.  At every school the </p><p>group passed out Japanese pencils to students--all donated to </p><p>UNICEF by Japan for this purpose. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) COMMUNITIES PITCHING IN:  Villagers nearly </p><p>everywhere add their own resources to supplement or build on </p><p>UNICEF projects.  Most UNICEF-assisted schools had certified </p><p>government teachers who spoke Burmese; younger students spoke </p><p>Shan or Pa-O, but little or no Burmese.  Parents in most </p><p>cases hired local, non-certified teachers (fluent in the </p><p>vernacular) to augment the Ministry of Education provided </p><p>faculty.  At one school the community replaced the hand pump </p><p>on a UNICEF-provided tube well with a diesel-powered pump to </p><p>supply safe water to the entire community (see below).  Local </p><p>residents often assist government nurses and doctors at rural </p><p>clinics, who make about $5 and $8 per month, with food and </p><p>other in-kind support. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) BUT POOR GOVERNANCE UNDERMINES PROSPECTS:  UNICEF is </p><p>perhaps the most effective of the various UN agencies </p><p>operating in Burma and has made notable progress in </p><p>eradicating polio, iodizing salt, and providing vitamin A </p><p>supplements to children.  The diplomats on this trip </p><p>personally administered oral polio immunizations and vitamin </p><p>A supplements to scores of two-year olds at various UNICEF </p><p>locations.  Next month the GOB Ministry of Health is going to </p><p>announce that wild polio has been eradicated in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>--  However, just as an ebb tide lowers all boats, so too </p><p>does poor governance in Burma harm overall levels of child </p><p>welfare despite a few specific improvements brokered by </p><p>UNICEF. </p><p> </p><p>-- At the school with the diesel-powered water pump, the </p><p>village has seen the price of diesel fuel quadruple since </p><p>they bought the pump 16 months ago.  Due to soaring fuel </p><p>costs, the village can only afford to run the pump for an </p><p>inadequate ten hours per month.  The SPDC\'s economic </p><p>mismanagement is causing inflation and other hardships for </p><p>the country\'s rural poor (i.e., most Burmese). </p><p> </p><p>-- In one Pa-O township the (ethnic Burman) health officials </p><p>told us they could not access the southern third of the </p><p>region readily, due to an uneasy relationship with the Pa-O </p><p>National Organization, an ethnic rebel group that signed a </p><p>cease-fire with the SPDC.  An edgy truce is better than </p><p>active combat, but the advent of a legitimate, representative </p><p>administration would improve access to child welfare programs </p><p>particularly in ethnic minority regions. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Shan State Guest House in Taunggyi is a beautiful </p><p>colonial-era structure.  Situated a thousand feet above it on </p><p>a cliff is a sprawling mansion called "Mount Pleasant."  The </p><p>group of diplomats, having just spent 3 days visiting bare </p><p>local clinics staffed by dedicated nurses making $5 per </p><p>month, discovered that Mount Pleasant is a new military </p><p>guesthouse reserved for senior generals.  Secretary 1 Khin </p><p>Nyunt particularly favors it, we were told.  Oddly, the </p><p>guesthouse sports a large megalithic structure rather like </p><p>Stonehenge in its front yard.  Such SPDC resource </p><p>allocations, i.e., building itself posh mountaintop retreats </p><p>while 35% of the country\'s children are malnourished, </p><p>according to UN figures, ought to give pause to international </p><p>donors when asked by Burma for concessional aid. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  If UNICEF and its sister UN organizations </p><p>were better funded and more flexible, they might be able to </p><p>make marginal improvements in child welfare and other aspects </p><p>of human development in this poor country.  Absent a </p><p>representative and accountable government, however, their </p><p>efforts are likely to be minimized or undone by a military </p><p>regime more intent on its own well-being than on that of the </p><p>people of Burma.  End Comment. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
