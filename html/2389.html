POPE, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00241  01 OF 02  151734Z </p><p> </p><p> SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (C)  IN HIS JANUARY 14 FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH BEFORE </p><p>PARLIAMENT, PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI AGAIN EMPHASIZED </p><p>ITALY\'S SOLID SUPPORT FOR AND COMMITMENT TO REMAIN WITHIN </p><p>EUROPE.  HE COMMENDED THE EURO AND REAFFIRMED THAT ITALY\'S </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY WOULD NOT EXPERIENCE A SEA CHANGE DURING HIS </p><p>TIME AT THE HELM AT THE MFA.  THE MFA ITSELF, HE SAID, WOULD </p><p>BE "REFORMED," INCLUDING TO BETTER REPRESENT ITALIAN ECONOMIC </p><p>AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS.  BERLUSCONI GAVE NO HINT OF WHO </p><p>MIGHT BE APPOINTED ITALY\'S NEXT FOREIGN MINISTER, BUT SAID HE </p><p>WOULD HOLD THE REINS HIMSELF AS LONG AS NECESSARY.  THE </p><p>OPPOSITION, PREDICTABLY, FOUND HIS SPEECH INSUFFICIENT. </p><p>WHICH FOREIGN POLICY WILL ITALY FOLLOW, THE DS\' FASSINO ASKED </p><p>RHETORICALLY?  WE CONTINUE TO SEE THIS AS AN INTERNAL DEBATE, </p><p>WITH THE OPPOSITION SEEKING TO MAKE POLITICAL HAY OVER AN </p><p>ACTION THAT RESULTED FROM A CLASH OF PERSONALITIES. </p><p>BERLUSCONI IS NOT/NOT SEEKING TO DIVORCE ITALY FROM EUROPE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>"ITALY VS. EUROPE" -- WHERE\'S THE BEEF? </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (U)  BERLUSCONI CHARACTERIZED RECENT POLEMICS IN ITALY </p><p>AND ABROAD OVER THE GOI\'S DEGREE OF EUROPEANISM AS "MUCH ADO </p><p>ABOUT NOTHING."  HE SAID THE GOI\'S COMMITMENT AND THAT OF ITS </p><p>GOVERNING MAJORITY IS TO "CHANGE ITALY, MODERNIZE THE STATE, </p><p>AND RE-LAUNCH THE ECONOMY," BUT ONLY BY "REMAINING FIRMLY </p><p>ANCHORED TO EUROPE."  HE SAID THE "EURO WORKS; THIS IS A GOOD </p><p>AND INDISPUTABLE TRUTH." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00241  01 OF 02  151734Z </p><p>3.  (U)  WHAT REMAINS, THE PRIME MINISTER CONTINUED, IS FOR </p><p>EUROPE TO WORK TOWARD POLITICAL INTEGRATION.  SUCH A PROCESS </p><p>IS LONG AND INVOLVED; IT IS NOT "A BOOK THAT IS ALREADY </p><p>WRITTEN BY AN UNKNOWN AUTHOR, NOR A MANUAL OF PROVISIONS AND </p><p>DOGMA THAT MUST BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT DISCUSSION." </p><p>POLITICAL INTEGRATION WILL RISE FROM THE COLLECTIVE WORK OF </p><p>THE EU\'S ELECTED INSTITUTIONS, NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS, AND </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, WITH THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE EU COMMISSION, THE </p><p>EU CONVENTION, AND ALL SECTORS OF SOCIETY, INCLUDING CULTURE, </p><p>LAW, BUSINESS, DIPLOMACY, CIVIL SOCIETY, AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  ON THE "PLAN OF ACTION" FOR A POLITICALLY INTEGRATED </p><p>EUROPE, BERLUSCONI SAID THE ITALIAN DEBATE IS OPEN AND </p><p>INVITED THE OPPOSITION TO JOIN IT, IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW EUROPE AND DETERMINE ITALY\'S ROLE </p><p>THEREIN.  HE SAID THE GOI WOULD APPOINT ITS DELEGATES TO THE </p><p>EU CONVENTION BY THE END OF JANUARY.  HE SAID HE COULD NOT </p><p>PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THEIR WORK, BECAUSE SEVERAL DECISIVE </p><p>ISSUES REMAIN OPEN AND ARE STILL BEING DEBATED BY MANY </p><p>COUNTRIES AND GOVERNMENTS.  LISTING SOME, HE MENTIONED FULL </p><p>LIBERALIZATION OF THE ENERGY SECTOR, THE REFORM OF THE LABOR </p><p>MARKET AND OF WELFARE, AGRICULTURE POLICIES, THE </p><p>HARMONIZATION OF TAX LAWS, SUPRA-NATIONAL RULES FOR CORPORATE </p><p>GOVERNANCE, A COMMON FOREIGN POLICY, AND A COMMON DEFENSE </p><p>POLICY WITHIN NATO.  HE STRESSED THAT THE GOI "WILL WORK </p><p>TOWARD POLITICAL INTEGRATION BASED ON THE WIDEST POSSIBLE </p><p>BASIS OF CONSENT AND LEGITIMIZATION," BECAUSE "NO EUROPEAN </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY CAN BE ESTABLISHED WITHOUT FULL-FLEDGED EUROPEAN </p><p>CITIZENSHIP."  WITH THIS IN MIND, HE NOTED THE NEED FOR THE </p><p>"ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SYNERGY BETWEEN SUPRA-NATIONAL ISSUES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00241  01 OF 02  151734Z </p><p>AND INTRA-GOVERNMENTAL ISSUES" IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF </p><p>EUROPEAN UNIFICATION.  HE ALSO STATED THAT THE GOI WOULD </p><p>"CONTINUE TO WORK AGAINST ALL VISIONS OF CENTRALIZED </p><p>BUREAUCRACY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  BERLUSCONI ALSO NOTED THAT THE SYSTEM OF "ENHANCED </p><p>COOPERATION" WITHIN EUROPE WORKS, BUT ARGUED THAT IT </p><p>ABSOLUTELY MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE NEEDS OF NATIONS </p><p>THAT HAVE REMAINED OUTSIDE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND WILL JOIN </p><p>IN THE FUTURE.  HE UNDERSCORED THAT "DIRECTORATES" ARE A </p><p>"CLAMOROUS STRATEGIC MISTAKE," AND REMARKED THAT "ITALY WILL </p><p>KNOW HOW TO MAKE ITSELF HEARD TO PROTECT ITS NATIONAL </p><p>INTERESTS ALONGSIDE THE COMMON INTERESTS OF A SPEEDY AND </p><p>EFFICIENT -- ALBEIT SOLIDLY LEGITIMIZED -) INTEGRATION."  HE </p><p>ADVOCATED ITALY\'S HISTORIC AND SOLID EUROPEANIST TRADITION </p><p>AND ITS "CONVICTION" THAT EUROPE\'S FOUNDATIONS "WERE NOT BORN </p><p>OUT OF POLITICS, BUT OUT OF CHRISTIANITY THAT FUSED HELLENISM </p><p>AND ROMAN CIVILIZATION."  RECALLING ITALY\'S FORMER PM AND FM </p><p>ALCIDE DE GASPERI (1881-1954), ONE OF THE EU\'S FOUNDING </p><p>FATHERS, BERLUSCONI ARGUED THAT EUROPE IS "PHENOMENON OF </p><p>CIVIL UNITY:  A RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, AND CIVIL UNITY THAT </p><p>UNITED POPULATIONS ON THIS SIDE AND THAT OF THE ATLANTIC </p><p>OCEAN UNDER THE NAME OF WEST." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4668 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00241  02 OF 02  151740Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------58168B  151740Z /75 </p><p>O 151707Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1689 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000241 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ECON, EU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: BERLUSCONI,S FOREIGN POLICY ADDRESS: ITALY REMAINS </p><p>STRONGLY IN EUROPE, BUT THINKS OF NATIONAL INTERESTS </p><p> </p><p>RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE FOR "PERSONAL REASONS" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00241  02 OF 02  151740Z </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (SBU)  ON RUGGIERO\'S RECENT "RESIGNATION" (SIC) AS FM, </p><p>BERLUSCONI REMARKED THAT, IN ACCEPTING THE TENURE AT THE MFA, </p><p>RUGGIERO HAD STATED HIS INTENTION TO GIVE HIMSELF A DEADLINE, </p><p>FOR PERSONAL REASONS.  (THE OPPOSITION BOOED BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>REFERENCE TO RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE FOR "PERSONAL REASONS.") </p><p>BERLUSCONI THANKED RUGGIERO FOR HIS LOYALTY WHILE IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  HE ADDED THAT HE WOULD FILL IN FOR RUGGIERO </p><p>"WITH DEDICATION AND ENTHUSIASM" FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME </p><p>NECESSARY TO "RE-ORIENT" THE MFA\'S WAY OF WORKING.  "WE MUST </p><p>KNOW HOW TO SELL THE PRODUCT OF OUR TALENT WITHOUT ANY </p><p>COMPLEXES...  WE MUST BE ON THE MARKET WITH ALL OF ITALY\'S </p><p>FORCE AND ITS POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND CULTURAL WEIGHT." </p><p>BERLUSCONI ADDED THAT HE DID NOT INTEND TO DECIMATE THE MFA </p><p>OR OVERHAUL IT COMPLETELY. </p><p> </p><p>OPPOSITION:  "WHICH EUROPEAN POLICY IS ITALY\'S?" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>7.  (SBU)  THE CENTER-LEFT REACTED PREDICTABLY TO PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S SPEECH:  REGARDLESS OF HIS WORDS, THEY DECLARED </p><p>&EUROSCEPTICISM8 THE CAUSE OF RUGGIERO,S DISMISSAL AND </p><p>BERLUSCONI,S ASSUMPTION OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  DEMOCRATS </p><p>OF THE LEFT (DS) LEADER PIERO FASSINO CHARACTERIZED </p><p>BERLUSCONI,S DECLARATIONS AND COMMITMENTS TO EUROPE AS </p><p>VAGUE, FOLLOWED BY TOO MANY \'IFS\' AND \'BUTS\'.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT IDEAS IN THE GOVERNMENT: ONE THAT </p><p>SEES EUROPE AS A NECESSARY EVIL FROM WHICH TO DEFEND ONESELF </p><p>AND LIMIT DAMAGES, AND THE OTHER, RUGGIERO\'S LINE, DECIDEDLY </p><p>PRO-EUROPE. FASSINO SAID BERLUSCONI FAILED TO EXPLAIN WHICH </p><p>EUROPEAN POLICY THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO DEVELOP OVER THE </p><p>NEXT FEW MONTHS.  DAISY PARTY LEADER FRANCESCO RUTELLI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00241  02 OF 02  151740Z </p><p>CHARGED THAT, WITH HIS SPEECH, BERLUSCONI STEPPED OUT OF THE </p><p>PRO-EUROPEAN FURROW PLOWED BY ITALY OVER HALF A CENTURY.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CHOSE A BAD MOMENT TO LAUNCH A </p><p>EUROSCEPTICAL OFFENSIVE WHICH WOULD DAMAGE ITALY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>INTEREST COMING ON TOP OF A SERIES OF POLEMICS, FROM THE </p><p>EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT, TO DECISIONS ON THE AIRBUS, TO </p><p>LOCATIONS FOR EU COMMITTEES.  FINALLY, MASSIMO D\'ALEMA, DS </p><p>PRESIDENT AND FORMER PM, DISMISSED THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>SPEECH AS "POINTLESS PROVOCATION" WHICH OFFERED NO </p><p>EXPLANATION FOR RUGGIERO\'S RESIGNATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  IN HIS SPEECH, FASSINO MADE REFERENCE TO </p><p>STATEMENTS BY DEFENSE MINISTER ANTONIO MARTINO AND JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER ROBERTO CASTELLI THAT SUGGEST ANY MAGISTRATE IN ANY </p><p>COUNTRY COULD WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND DECIDE TO ARREST ANYONE </p><p>HE PLEASES.  FASSINO RECALLED THIS WAS SPARKED BY THE LAW ON </p><p>ROGATORIES.  FASSINO ENDED BY SAYING THAT &THE OPPOSITION </p><p>WILL TAKE ACTION, IF THIS GOVERNMENT DOESN\'T, TO KEEP ITALY </p><p>IN EUROPE." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>9.  (C)  UPON READING A COMPLETE TEXT OF BERLUSCONI\'S SPEECH, </p><p>THERE IS LITTLE TO JUSTIFY THE ALLEGATIONS OF ITALY\'S </p><p>CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION.   THEY ARE, IN SHORT, DOING WHAT IS </p><p>NORMAL IN POLITICS -- SEEKING AN ELECTORAL AND POPULAR </p><p>ADVANTAGE.  AS NOTED, INTER ALIA, IN THE JANUARY 15 NEW YORK </p><p>TIMES ARTICLE "BERLUSCONI SAYS ITALY WON\'T TAKE EUROPE\'S </p><p>ORDERS," ITALIANS ARE STRONGLY PRO-EUROPE.  THEY ARE ALSO BY </p><p>AND LARGE PRO-BERLUSCONI, SOMETHING THE OPPOSITION CLEARLY </p><p>WANTS TO CHANGE.  WHAT WE FIND MORE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00241  02 OF 02  151740Z </p><p>THE OVERWHELMING TENOR OF THE MEDIA HEADLINES (NOT ONLY IN </p><p>ITALY) WHICH, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY SIT ATOP LARGELY </p><p>ACCURATE ARTICLES, INVARIABLY REFLECT THE TONE AND TENOR OF </p><p>ITALY\'S OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  BERLUSCONI IS FLAGGING ISSUES NOT UNFAMILIAR, FROM </p><p>OUR UNDERSTANDING HERE, TO BRITAIN\'S PRIME MINISTER TONY </p><p>BLAIR OR TO OUR OWN PRESIDENT.  THE QUESTIONS HE RAISES ARE </p><p>ONES THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL INDEED HAVE TO TACKLE AS IT </p><p>WRESTLES WITH ITS DEVELOPMENT AND THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME </p><p>AND SEEKS TO COME TO GRIPS WITH ITS "DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT." </p><p>PROMOTION OF NATIONAL INTERESTS IS NOT TANTAMOUNT TO </p><p>BETRAYING INSTITUTIONS OF WHICH A NATION IS A MEMBER, OR IN </p><p>THIS CASE, DOES NOT EQUATE TO BEING "ANTI-EUROPE."  WE REMAIN </p><p>CONVINCED THAT THE "ITALY VS. EUROPE"DEBATE IS LITTLE BUT </p><p>SMOKE AND MIRRORS.  ITALY\'SFOREIGN POLICY HAS NOT CHANGED </p><p>WITH THE DEPARTUR OF RUGGIERO AND BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>AUTO-APPOINTMENT A FOREIGN MINISTER.  WHAT WE ARE WATCHING </p><p>IS A DOMSTIC SPAT BETWEEN SITTING GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITIO, </p><p>SPARKED BY THE OUTSPOKEN AND FRANKLY INSUBORDIATE BEHAVIOR </p><p>OF AN OUTSIDER CABINET MEMBER. </p><p>POE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00241 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
