<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001998 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT WSSD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "West\'s concern on Zim baffling" </p><p>      the government-controlled daily "The Herald" dedicated </p><p>      its August 30 editorial to encouraging the West to </p><p>      seek a face-to-face audience with the government of </p><p>      Zimbabwe to discuss issues of concern.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The so-called world leaders seem to have a lot </p><p>      of concern for Zimbabwe to the extent that they want </p><p>      to discuss the country at the on-going Earth Summit in </p><p>      South Africa.  While this concern seems commendable, </p><p>      what is baffling most right thinking Zimbabweans is </p><p>      that none of these international leaders want to </p><p>      engage the country\'s leaders about what they perceive </p><p>      to have gone wrong in Zimbabwe. . .?  Ever since the </p><p>      land issue became more pronounced, the Tony Blair </p><p>      government has avoided Zimbabwe like the plague.  The </p><p>      American government has followed suit and made </p><p>      pronouncements on Zimbabwe based on biased British </p><p>      propaganda churned out by its paid local private </p><p>      media.  This is why a whole Assistant Secretary of </p><p>      State of the U.S. can publicly lie that the food </p><p>      shortages in Zimbabwe were by the ZANU PF government\'s </p><p>      land reform exercise despite the fact that this was </p><p>      caused by a severe drought that affected not only the </p><p>      country, but the sub-region as a whole. . .  The </p><p>      Canadians have also fallen into the stupid trap. . . </p><p>      The Australians will of course not be outdone and have </p><p>      already fashioned charges of ethnic cleansing against </p><p>      the Zimbabwean government. </p><p> </p><p>      "Even the Secretary-General of the UN, Mr. Kofi </p><p>      Anan who we have always regarded as a reasonable </p><p>      man, had to add his voice on Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      condemnation. . .  He too was scared to be seen </p><p>      in Zimbabwe lest the ZANU PF government would </p><p>      open his eyes to the truth, which he would have </p><p>      difficulty in dealing with to the satisfaction </p><p>      of the super power nations.  What is now evident </p><p>      is that all these super power nations are so </p><p>      afraid of little Zimbabwe that they would dare </p><p>      not come and confront the ZANU PF government. </p><p>      The government would certainly be too glad to </p><p>      not only host them but discuss the alleged </p><p>      abuses of human rights, the unfair dispossession </p><p>      of whites of their land, the suppression of </p><p>      Press freedom, the clampdown on the opposition, </p><p>      among other allegations that take their fancy." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
