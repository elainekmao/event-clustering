<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KADUNA 0709 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  ECON, SOCI, SREF, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  REPORTS OF STARVATION IN NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  LAGOS 06244 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  CONGEN HAS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT REFTEL REPORT OF </p><p>DROUGHT-RELATED STARVATION IN NORTHERN NIGERIA.  WE </p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT THE SITUATION IN SOME AREAS IS VERY SERIOUS, </p><p>AND WE WOULD, THEREFORE, NOT BE SURPRISED TO FIND SCATTERED </p><p>INCIDENCES OF STARVATION.  HOWEVER, NONE OF OUR SOURCES IN </p><p>THE AREA HAVE REPORTED IT TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM, AND WE </p><p>DOUBT IT EXISTS ON ANY LARGE SCALE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS FOOD SHORTAGES IN SOME AREAS IS </p><p>SUBSTANTIATED BY THE REPEATED PLEAS BY THE NORTHERN </p><p>GOVERNORS FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE--INCLUDING FOOD AID--FOR </p><p>DROUGHT VICTIMS IN THEIR STATES.  MUCH OF THE U.S.--PURCHASED </p><p>MAIZE WHICH RECENTLY ARRIVED IN LAGOS IS EVIDENTLY INTENDED </p><p>FOR THIS PURPOSE.  IF THE AMERICAN GRAIN ACTUALLY FINDS ITS </p><p>WAY TO THOSE MOST IN NEED, THE SITUATION SHOULD BE </p><p>ALLEVIATED SOMEWHAT.  LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS IN THE </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF AVAILABLE ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES AND THE </p><p>SIMPLE INABILITY OF THE NEEDIEST PEOPLE TO PAY FOR </p><p>FOODSTOCKS MAY, IN FACT, BE THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING </p><p>FACTORS TO ANY OCCURRENCES OF STARVATION THAT EXIST. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ARGUING AGAINST REPORTS OF WIDESPREAD STARVATION </p><p>IS THE RELAXED ATTITUDE OF THE FMG TOWARD ALIEN DROUGHT </p><p>REFUGEES IN NIGERIA.  NO EFFORTS WERE MADE TO EVICT </p><p>THESE PEOPLE DURING THE RECENT EXPULSION EXERCISE, AND </p><p>INTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER MAGORO STATED LAST WEEK THAT </p><p>NIGERIA IS ACCOMMODATING 250,000 ALIEN DROUGHT REFUGEES </p><p>ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS.  IF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF </p><p>NIGERIANS WERE THREATENED WITH STARVATION, THE FMG </p><p>WOULD LIKELY HAVE A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE TO SO LARGE A </p><p>GROUP OF ALIENS COMPETING FOR AVAILABLE FOOD SUPPLIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDRESEN </p><p></p></div>
