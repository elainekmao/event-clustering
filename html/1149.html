<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001318 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  06/15/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VM, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  MFA OFFICIAL ON STRAINS IN U.S.-SRV RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES DENNIS HARTER. </p><p> REASONS:  1.5 (B) (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BEGIN SUMMARY:  MFA AMERICAS DEPT HEAD NGUYEN </p><p>MANH HUNG RECENTLY LAMENTED TO THE AMBASSADOR STRAINS </p><p>THAT HAVE ENTERED U.S.-VIETNAM RELATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, </p><p>THE GVN HAS TAKEN EXCEPTION TO SEVERAL NON-BINDING </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTIONS WHICH ARE CRITICAL OF THE </p><p>SRV.  HE URGED THE AMBASSADOR TO "USE HIS INFLUENCE" TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01318  01 OF 02  151013Z </p><p>STEM SUCH ACTIONS.  AMB. PETERSON REPLIED HE COULD TALK </p><p>TO LEGISLATORS BUT NEITHER HE NOR THE PRESIDENT COULD </p><p>TELL WHAT THE CONGRESS SHOULD DO OR NOT DO.  BOTH </p><p>AGREED THAT THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF THE WAR </p><p>HAS RAISED EMOTIONS ON BOTH SIDES.  HUNG CONVEYED AGAIN </p><p>MFA COMPLAINTS OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF THE U.S. MISSION </p><p>AND SOME PERSONNEL.  THE AMBASSADOR REBUFFED SUCH </p><p>COMPLAINTS AS NEITHER JUSTIFIED NOR WARRANTED AND </p><p>STRESSED THE NEED FOR TRUST.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN A MAY 25 MEETING ON OTHER ISSUES, MFA </p><p>AMERICAS DEPT DIRECTOR NGUYEN MANH HUNG LAMENTED TO </p><p>AMBASSADOR PETERSON TENSIONS THAT HAD RECENTLY CREPT </p><p>INTO THE U.S.-VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP.  HUNG COMPLAINED </p><p>ABOUT SEVERAL NON-BINDING RESOLUTIONS UNDER </p><p>CONSIDERATION IN CONGRESS WHICH ARE CRITICAL OF THE </p><p>SRV.  HE SAID HOUSE RESOLUTION 295 PARTICULARLY IS </p><p>"VERY HOSTILE" TOWARD HANOI (NOTE:  295 IS A SENSE OF </p><p>THE CONGRESS RESOLUTION THAT ATTACKS THE MONOPOLY ON </p><p>POWER OF THE CPV.  END NOTE.)  HOUSE RESOLUTION 322 </p><p>(WHICH PRAISES THE SACRIFICES OF SOUTH VIETNAM\'S ARMED </p><p>FORCES) IS ANOTHER ONE WHICH THE GVN FINDS OFFENSIVE, </p><p>HUNG SAID.  HE URGED AMBASSADOR PETERSON TO "USE HIS </p><p>INFLUENCE" TO PREVENT SUCH CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WHILE NOTING THAT NEITHER HE NOR THE PRESIDENT </p><p>HAS POWERS OVER THE U.S. CONGRESS, AMBASSADOR PETERSON </p><p>SAID HE WOULD HAVE OPPORTUNTIES TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER </p><p>WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS JUNE 15 </p><p>TESTIMONY ON JACKSON-VANIK. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01318  01 OF 02  151013Z </p><p>5.  (C) HUNG SAID THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF </p><p>THE WAR HAS RAISED EMOTIONS ON BOTH SIDES.  WHILE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION FIGURES SUCH AS THE AMBASSADOR ASSURE </p><p>HANOI THAT THE USG HAS NO INTENTIONS TO DESTABILIZE THE </p><p>GVN, AT THE SAME TIME CONGRESS TAKES ACTIONS WHICH </p><p>INDICATE OTHERWISE.  SOME IN THE GVN, E.G., THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, TAKE THESE ACTIONS AS EFFORTS TO </p><p>UNDERMINE VIETNAM\'S POLITICAL SYSTEM.  AMB. PETERSON </p><p>ASSURED HUNG THAT THIS WAS DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE.  WE </p><p>WANT A VIETNAM THAT IS STABLE AND PROSPEROUS AND A </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP THAT GROWS, HE SAID.  HE </p><p>STRESSED THE NEED FOR THE MFA TO EDUCATE VIETNAMESE </p><p>OFFICIALS ON THE U.S. SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, THE ROLE OF CONGRESS.  THE 25TH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY INDEED HAS RAISED EMOTIONS, HE SAID.  THERE </p><p>HAVE BEEN STATEMENTS ABOUT THE U.S. FROM VIETNAMESE </p><p>OFFICIALS THAT HAVE ALSO BEEN INFLAMMATORY.  IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES NOT TO GET TOO </p><p>UPSET OVER SOME OF THE RHETORIC BEING CHURNED OUT BY </p><p>SOME PLAYERS.  AMB. PETERSON SAID RECENT STRAINS HAVE </p><p>CAUSED HIM TO WORRY ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF U.S.-VIETNAM </p><p>RELATIONS.  HUNG AGREED, ADDING THAT STRAINS COULD </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO A "VICIOUS CYCLE DOWNWARD."  AMB. </p><p>PETERSON RECOMMENDED THAT, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, BOTH </p><p>SIDES AIR THEIR GRIEVANCES PRIVATELY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) HUNG AGAIN BROUGHT UP GVN COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF SOME U.S. MISSION STAFF.  THIS TIME, IT </p><p>WAS OVER THE CONTACTS CG HCMC\'S POLOFF HAS HAD CONTACT </p><p>RECENTLY WITH HOA HAO DISSIDENTS.  THE MFA\'S BRANCH </p><p>OFFICE IN HCMC (SNV - FOREIGN OFFICE) HAD SENT A NOTE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01318  01 OF 02  151013Z </p><p>TO THE MFA ON THIS.  AMB. PETERSON SAID THAT THE MFA </p><p>COULD RESPOND TO ITS COUNTERPART OFFICE AS THEY </p><p>PLEASED.  HE WANTED TO REITERATE TO THE MFA THAT U.S. </p><p>MISSION ACTIVITIES ARE TRANSPARENT AND FOR A GOOD </p><p>PURPOSE.  IN THE CASE IN QUESTION, THE POLOFF WAS </p><p>COLLECTING INFORMATION THAT WOULD ASSIST US IN OUR </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE WITH THE GVN AND FOR RESPONDING </p><p>TO CONGRESSIONAL QUERIES.  WITHOUT FIRST-HAND </p><p>INFORMATION, THE USG IS SUBJECT TO OFTEN ERRONEOUS OR </p><p>INCOMPLETE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES.  TOO </p><p>OFTEN SUCH INFORMATION IS EXAGGERATED OR PLAIN WRONG. </p><p>WE SHOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED TO WHOM WE MAY SPEAK.  "YOU </p><p>CANNOT EXPECT US NOT TO TALK TO PEOPLE," THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) HUNG NEXT TOOK ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE </p><p>EMBASSY\'S PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION.  HE URGED OUR EMBASSY </p><p>TO "ADHERE TO THE RULES LAID DOWN BY THE MIN. OF </p><p>CULTURE AND INFORMATION (WHEREBY EMBASSIES ARE REQUIRED </p><p>TO OBTAIN PRIOR CLEARANCE BEFORE SENDING MAIL TO ANY </p><p>VIETNAMESE).  AMBASSADOR PETERSON REPLIED THAT SUCH A </p><p>MEASURE IS TOO ONEROUS AND IS UNNECESSARY.  "YOU CANNOT </p><p>EXPECT US NOT TO SEND MATERIALS TO THOSE WHO REQUEST </p><p>IT," HE SAID.  ANY MINISTRY OR ORGANIZATION WHICH DOES </p><p>NOT WANT TO RECEIVE MAILINGS FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY </p><p>SHOULD SO INFORM US (NOTE:  AS HAS THE MFA.  END NOTE.) </p><p>BUT SUCH DEMANDS REFLECT A LACK OF TRUST IN THE </p><p>EMBASSY.  SUCH A SENTIMENT IS "VERY DANGEROUS," THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SAID.  THE U.S. EMBASSY HAS WORKED </p><p>ASSIDUOUSLY TO BUILD TRUST.  IT IS THE CORE OF A SOUND </p><p>RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01318  02 OF 02  151013Z </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  UNLIKE HIS ANTEDILUVIAN COLLEAGUES IN </p><p>THE MFA\'S PROTOCOL DEPT, HUNG DELIVERED A HARD MESSAGE </p><p>WITH A SOFT TOUCH.  NONETHELESS, THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR: </p><p>HANOI SEES A USG (ALBIET ONLY FROM RECENT CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>ACTIONS) THAT HAS RECENTLY SHOWN ITSELF HOSTILE TOWARD </p><p>THE SRV.  AS A RESULT, THE MORE PARANOID WITHIN THE SRV </p><p>APPARATUS VIEW THE U.S. EMBASSY AS THE CATSPAW OF SUCH </p><p>HOSTILITY.  DESPITE OUR REPEATED EFFORTS TO EDUCATE THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE ON THE DIVISION OF POWERS WITHIN THE USG, </p><p>THEY EITHER DO NOT GET IT OR CHOOSE NOT TO BELIEVE US. </p><p>THIS FUNDAMENTAL LACK OF APPRECIATION BY THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>OF THE AUTONOMOUS ROLE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN DEMOCRACIES IS ALSO A COMPLAINT SHARED BY </p><p>OTHER WESTERN EMBASSIES HERE WHO HAVE RECEIVED THEIR </p><p>OWN COMPLAINTS FROM THE MFA OVER ACTIONS BY THEIR </p><p>RESPECTIVE LEGISLATURES ON A RANGE OF ISSUES BEARING ON </p><p>VIETNAM. </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
