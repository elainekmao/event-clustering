<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001292 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP, EB </p><p>BANGKOK FOR AGCOUNSELOR </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAGR, PHUM, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA: BREADBASKET AND BASKET CASE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Persistent reports of unrest at food </p><p>warehouses and distribution points in Burma suggest the </p><p>government ration system may be breaking down.  If true, then </p><p>food problems will only become worse for Burma\'s poorest in </p><p>coming months as inflation accelerates, the kyat continues </p><p>its free-fall, and corruption corrodes the government\'s </p><p>ability to deliver basic commodities at subsidized prices. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Supply is Up, So is the Price </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Burma does not have a food shortage.  While </p><p>government statistics are always suspect, the information </p><p>available suggests that Burma has consistently produced as </p><p>much or more rice per capita as any other country in the </p><p>world.  According to local numbers compiled by the U.S. </p><p>Department of Agriculture, Burma annually produces about 800 </p><p>pounds of rice per person, i.e., as much as Thailand, and </p><p>more than either Vietnam or Bangladesh. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) This year, Burma seems to be headed again for a </p><p>relatively good rice crop.  While heavy rains have damaged </p><p>crops in central Burma and in the Irrawaddy delta, Burma </p><p>nevertheless appears headed for a wet season harvest that is </p><p>roughly equivalent to last year\'s 15 million tons. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Stocks are also allegedly ample.  By government fiat, </p><p>all rice merchants must retain a 120-250 bag surplus </p><p>(depending on each merchant\'s sales volume) that the regime </p><p>can order onto the market at a subsidized price through the </p><p>Rice Millers Association.  In addition, government officials </p><p>claim to have "strategic" reserves for use during national </p><p>emergencies, though there are real questions as to how large </p><p>those strategic stocks are -- or if they even exist. </p><p> </p><p>The Price of Tea in Burma </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Despite this evidence of adequate supply, there have </p><p>been persistent tales of hardship among poorer families and </p><p>rumors of sporadic unrest at rice distribution centers across </p><p>the country.  These appear to be the result of three primary </p><p>problems.  The first is wage and price pressures generated by </p><p>decades of bad economic management by the government.  Forty </p><p>years of military rule has crippled economic activity, while </p><p>the government has supported itself in recent years </p><p>essentially with money printed at the Central Bank.  For </p><p>workers, this translates into a combination of unemployment </p><p>and inflation that has held down wages and boosted prices. </p><p>Over the past 12 months, retail prices in Rangoon have </p><p>increased by approximately 60 percent, while wages have </p><p>remained stagnant.  Right now rice in the open market in </p><p>Rangoon is going for 300 to 350 kyat per pyi (2.2 kilograms), </p><p>while factory workers make on average only 300 to 500 kyat </p><p>per day, government pensioners only 600 to 800 kyat per </p><p>month, and an average laborer or street merchant perhaps 100 </p><p>to 200 kyat per day. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The second factor is a poorly functioning public </p><p>ration system, which covers politically sensitive items like </p><p>rice, cooking oil (imported palm oil from Malaysia), </p><p>gasoline, and soap.  Whenever rice prices begin to rise, the </p><p>government orders the Rice Millers Association to work with </p><p>local township authorities to determine the amount of rice </p><p>needed and then procure it at a subsidized price set by the </p><p>central government.  The township authorities are then </p><p>responsible for distribution at this below market price to </p><p>local families. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) However, even the government\'s subsidized prices </p><p>(recently raised from 100 to 130 kyat per pyi for rice) are </p><p>too high for some.  There is also no needs test; the ration </p><p>is available to all citizens regardless of their economic </p><p>circumstances.  Consequently, many who do not need the </p><p>subsidized rice claim their ration anyway to resell on the </p><p>open market, exhausting stocks.  Moreover, because </p><p>distribution centers are disorganized in checking </p><p>identification for disbursement of subsidized cooking oil, a </p><p>blossoming industry has emerged for those who are able to get </p><p>multiple rations to resell for a handsome profit.  Finally, </p><p>supplies are uncertain thanks to corruption among the </p><p>township authorities.  We have heard of two recent cases </p><p>where the police arrested local authorities for lying about </p><p>availability of subsidized rice so that they could resell it </p><p>in bulk on the black market. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The third factor in the food problem is the obstacles </p><p>to the domestic rice trade that the government imposes in an </p><p>effort to stem the border trade in rice.  Earlier this </p><p>summer, for instance, rice shipments from Magwe Division to </p><p>northern Rakhine State were reportedly cut off entirely in an </p><p>effort to stop cross-border sales to Bangladesh that are </p><p>stimulated by the subsidized prices in Burma.  The result is </p><p>local shortages, usually in the border regions adjacent to </p><p>China, India, Bangladesh, and Thailand. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The net result for the government of this system of </p><p>rations, subsidies, and trade barriers is a highly </p><p>politicized food distribution system that could backfire as </p><p>inflation continues to rise, and truly steep differentials </p><p>emerge between open market and subsidized prices.  Thus far, </p><p>only the poorest in Burma have suffered very much.  However, </p><p>if the system does break down and the government does find </p><p>itself incapable of keeping its implicit promise to deliver </p><p>food at "reasonable prices," especially in the major urban </p><p>areas, then real trouble could result.  The government is </p><p>gambling that it can maintain control of the ration system </p><p>until the wet season harvest in October and November.  If as </p><p>predicted the harvest is adequate, then the simple increased </p><p>availability of food should put a damper on rice price </p><p>pressures for a few months.  However, if the harvest is below </p><p>expectations, there could be more widespread difficulties. </p><p>End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
