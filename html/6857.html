<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PD, S/CT, DS/DSS/ITA, </p><p>DSERCC, INR/NESA, AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  03-27-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, ECON, ASEC, PINR, CE, MV, IZ, Maldives, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01:  Maldives issues statement re Iraq; </p><p>Religious groups down on war; More rallies planned </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 03/26/03 e-mail </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 512, and previous </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 170 (all Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons:  1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update, focused on reaction to the war in </p><p>Iraq in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, reviews: </p><p> </p><p>>> In its first public statement, the Maldivian </p><p>government says it is "very concerned" about the war </p><p> </p><p>>> In Sri Lanka, religious groups issue statements </p><p>against the war </p><p> </p><p>>> More anti-war rallies in the works </p><p> </p><p>>> Spotlight on two major Sri Lankan opponents of the </p><p>war:  Alavi Moulana and Baddegama Samitha </p><p> </p><p>>> Local concerns sprout re potential economic problems </p><p>caused by war, as the GSL seeks to dispel them </p><p> </p><p>(((Note:  Latest media coverage is provided Septel.))) </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>Maldives Issues Statement </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Maldivian government has issued its first </p><p>public statement re the Iraq conflict.  Although only </p><p>posted on the GoRM\'s website on March 26, the statement </p><p>is dated March 21.  It was issued in the name of </p><p>President Maumoon Gayoom.  In its key political </p><p>reference, it states: </p><p> </p><p>"The Maldives is very concerned over the grave dangers </p><p>to which the Muslim people of Iraq are being exposed by </p><p>the war.  The government hopes that the military </p><p>operations would end very soon, and with minimal </p><p>destruction and injury to the brotherly people of Iraq. </p><p>The Maldives desires peace, stability, and security for </p><p>the region." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The rest of the page-long statement reviews </p><p>various measures the government is taking in reaction to </p><p>the start of the war.  These measures include forming a </p><p>government committee to monitor Gulf events, the </p><p>cancellation of parties and receptions by the GoRM, and </p><p>suspension of all overseas government travel unless </p><p>deemed essential.  (Note:  The complete text of the </p><p>statement was e-mailed to SA/INS in Ref A.) </p><p> </p><p>============================ </p><p>Religious Groups Down on War </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In Sri Lanka, two religious groups have </p><p>recently issued statements against the war.  Colombo\'s </p><p>Grand Mosque issued a statement on March 25, for </p><p>example, which emphatically condemned the war. </p><p>(Note:  The Grand Mosque is the major mosque in Colombo </p><p>and the most important in the country.)  The statement </p><p>asserted, in part, that "It is sad to note that the U.S. </p><p>administration has ignored the appeals made by heads of </p><p>state and religious leaders to further explore peaceful </p><p>means of disarming Iraq...It is not too late for the </p><p>United States to reconsider its decision." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) In the meantime, the National Christian Council </p><p>(NCC), an umbrella organization for Protestant churches </p><p>(Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist), issued a statement </p><p>on March 26 which "deplored" the start of the war.  The </p><p>NCC statement went on to comment:  "The experiences we </p><p>have had in our own country strengthens our conviction </p><p>that dialogue and negotiation alone can evolve into </p><p>permanent and lasting resolution."  (Note:  In other </p><p>reaction, comments by local Roman Catholic Church </p><p>prelates have mirrored the anti-war perspective of Pope </p><p>John Paul II.  Major Buddhist and Hindu leaders have </p><p>basically steered clear of commenting on the war, thus </p><p>far.  See below, however, re anti-war role of Buddhist </p><p>monk and MP Baddegama Samitha.) </p><p> </p><p>================================= </p><p>New Anti-War Rallies in the Works </p><p>================================= </p><p>6.  (SBU) Thus far, anti-war demonstrations in Sri Lanka </p><p>have neither been frequent, nor particularly large. </p><p>Anti-war organizers, however, are trying again, and on </p><p>Friday, March 28, several rallies are in the works at </p><p>various sites.  From what we have picked up, at least </p><p>two rallies are being planned in Colombo, including one </p><p>at Galle Face Green, a large sea front park down-the- </p><p>road from the embassy.  Both rallies are slated to kick </p><p>off after Friday mid-day prayers, so that Muslims -- </p><p>presumably energized by anti-war sermons -- can join in </p><p>right from the mosque.  Various rallies are also planned </p><p>in Muslim-dominated areas in the Eastern Province (where </p><p>there are many radicalized Muslims due to the conflict </p><p>with the Tamil Tigers), in parts of the south, and north </p><p>of Colombo.  The sponsorship of these rallies continues </p><p>to be pretty much evenly split among various Muslim </p><p>groups and the radical left Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP). </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>Two Key Anti-War Figures </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) While the anti-war effort in Sri Lanka has not </p><p>seemed to have taken off as of yet, two politicians are </p><p>playing major roles in organizing opposition, thus far. </p><p>The two, Alavi Moulana and Baddegama Samitha, are coming </p><p>to the anti-war effort from different angles.  Moulana, </p><p>71, the Governor of the Western Province (where Colombo </p><p>is located) and a former People\'s Alliance (PA) </p><p>minister, is a major Muslim leader, who has been </p><p>canvassing the Muslim community for support against U.S. </p><p>policy in Iraq.  A former trade unionist, Moulana is </p><p>also trying to tap into his union connections.  In this </p><p>effort, Moulana -- who is believed to maintain many </p><p>connections in the Middle East -- has made some sharply </p><p>critical comments about the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The other leader, Venerable Baddegama Samitha, </p><p>51, is a Buddhist monk and member of the PA, who was </p><p>elected to Parliament in the December 2001 general </p><p>election.  (Note:  Samitha is the first Buddhist monk </p><p>ever to sit in Parliament.  He is a member, somewhat </p><p>bizarrely given his clerical status, of a small </p><p>Trotskyite faction of the PA.)  Within the PA, Samitha </p><p>is a strongly pro-peace process voice, unlike some other </p><p>elements in the grouping.  Re Iraq, however, Samitha has </p><p>taken a sharply anti-U.S. tack, personally leading some </p><p>anti-war demonstrations.  When he is not politicking, </p><p>Samitha runs his own temple in the Galle area in the </p><p>south of the country. </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>Local Concerns re the Economy </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) In other Iraq-related news, press articles and </p><p>contacts are increasingly mentioning worries that Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s economy could possibly be hurt by a long war. </p><p>These concerns revolve around fears that gasoline prices </p><p>might spike, that Sri Lankan workers in the Middle East </p><p>might lose their jobs, that tourism might tank, and that </p><p>tea sales might suffer.  (Note:  See Ref C, for a </p><p>detailed review of these concerns.)  Thus far, the Sri </p><p>Lankan government has worked hard to dispel the </p><p>concerns.  The GSL, for example, has underscored that it </p><p>has enough gas in reserve to handle needs if there is an </p><p>emergency.  Moreover, the government has pointed out </p><p>that hardly any of the over 700,000 Sri Lankan workers </p><p>in the Middle East have had to come home and, thus, </p><p>remittances remain intact.  While sales of tea are down </p><p>in the important Middle Eastern market, the government </p><p>believes that sales will rebound.  Finally, tourism has </p><p>not seemed to suffer in any appreciable fashion. </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The Maldivian government\'s statement was not </p><p>particularly helpful, but not harmful either.  In making </p><p>it, our guess is that the GoRM was reacting to its </p><p>public, which is reportedly largely anti-war (the </p><p>Maldives is 100 percent Muslim).  Re Sri Lanka, our </p><p>assessment is that a wide swath of the populace is also </p><p>against the war, but the depth of concern is vague and </p><p>not very deep.  Only among the Muslim minority have we </p><p>noticed anything approaching passion.  That said, </p><p>although their efforts have barely managed to register, </p><p>so far,  Muslims groups and the Sinhalese left appear </p><p>committed  to trying to torque up their anti-war </p><p>campaign.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
