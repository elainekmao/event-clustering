SECTOR WEST IS GENERALLY QUIET; IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>THE VANCE PLAN IS FURTHER ADVANCED THAN IN ANY OTHER </p><p>SECTOR.  THE PROGRAMME OF VISITS OF DISPLACED PERSONS </p><p>FROM BOTH SIDES TO THEIR FORMER VILLAGES IS </p><p>PROGRESSING: AS OF LAST WEEK, 1,500 PEOPLE HAD </p><p>VISITED 50 VILLAGES TO EXAMINE THE DAMAGES TO THEIR </p><p>HOMES AND START PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR REPAIR.  THE </p><p>AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED 500 TEMPORARY HOUSING </p><p>UNITS FOR PEOPLE WHO WISH TO WORK ON THEIR HOUSES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02400  02 OF 04  161003Z </p><p>DURING THE WINTER.  IN ONE AREA NEIGHBORING SECTOR </p><p>WEST, UNPROFOR HAS PROVIDED INFORMATION RELATING TO </p><p>RESOLUTION 780 TO THE WAR CRIMES COMMISSION, WHICH </p><p>WAS SCHEDULED TO MEET YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN SECTORS EAST AND SOUTH, THE TREND TOWARD </p><p>ANARCHY CONTINUES.  GANGS OF TERRORISTS ROAM THE </p><p>AREA, THERE ARE POLICE FORCES WHO DO NOT POLICE, </p><p>PROSECUTORS WHO DO NOT PROSECUTE, AND COURTS THAT ARE </p><p>AFRAID TO SIT.  (UNPROFOR MADE AVAILABLE A PAGE </p><p>GIVING EXTRACTS FROM UNCIVPOL REPORTS SUMMARISING </p><p>RECENT INCIDENTS FROM SECTORS EAST AND SOUTH).  MANY </p><p>OF THESE ARE SMALL, NASTY, COWARDLY CRIMES, USUALLY </p><p>ETHNICALLY BASED AND AIMED AT OLD PEOPLE LIVING </p><p>ALONE.  THE MAJORITY ARE AGAINST CROATS LIVING IN </p><p>SERB-CONTROLLED TERRITORIES, BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME </p><p>AGAINST SERBS LIVING IN CROAT-CONTROLLED AREAS.  IN A </p><p>WAY, THERE HAS BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENT, AS THERE ARE </p><p>FEWER MURDERS THAN BEFORE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ALONG THE EDGES OF SECTOR SOUTH, SOME CEASE-FIRE </p><p>VIOLATIONS, MAINLY BY THE CROATIAN ARMY, ARE PROBABLY </p><p>PROVOCATIONS.  AS THERE HAS STILL NOT BEEN </p><p>DISARMAMANT OF THE SERB MILITIA, THE CROATIAN ARMY </p><p>HAS, IN SOME CASES, MOVED BACK UP FROM THE WITHDRAWAL </p><p>LINE, TO THE CONFRONTATION LINE, AND THE RELATIVELY </p><p>HEAVILY ARMED SERB MILITIA HAVE ALSO MOVED UP TO THAT </p><p>LINE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>1,500 TONS OF EXPLOSIVES REPORTED IN PERUCA DAM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02400  02 OF 04  161003Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9.
