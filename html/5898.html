RIYADH 0130 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 5543 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  Common with Riyadh (Ref A), yet </p><p>contrary to earlier assertions by Kuwaiti officials (Ref B), </p><p>the GCC Customs Union that began ostensibly on January 1, </p><p>2003, remains for Kuwait a union in name only.  While the GOK </p><p>has enacted a common external tariff, as stipulated by the </p><p>Customs Union, it has yet to pass a new customs law and </p><p>continues to charge its standard 4 percent base rate on many </p><p>goods entering the country, in addition to the 5 percent </p><p>common tariff imposed on imports at the point of entry into </p><p>the GCC.  One GOK official pointed out that "legally, Kuwait </p><p>is not really in" the Customs Union, while another official </p><p>admitted that "since January 1, nothing has changed."  As to </p><p>when Kuwait will pass a new customs law and officially join </p><p>the Union, given the typical pace of change in the country, </p><p>"Allahu alam" (God only knows).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Information for this cable, the second in a series </p><p>tracking Kuwait\'s involvement in the Customs Union, was </p><p>compiled from a variety of sources.  EconOff met with Mashaan </p><p>Alsiady, a Land Port Supervisor at Kuwait\'s General </p><p>Administration of Customs; Mona Essa Al-Qallaf, Head of the </p><p>Kuwait Customs Legal Office; Ghazi Faisal Al-AbdulJalil, Head </p><p>of Gulf Cooperation Affairs in Kuwait\'s Ministry of Finance; </p><p>and James Piatt, the U.S. Customs Office representative in </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DOUBLE-DIPPING: As part of its membership in the GCC </p><p>Customs Union launched January 1, 2003, the GOK agreed to </p><p>impose an across-the-board tariff of 5 percent on most </p><p>imports.  According to Customs officials, however, as of </p><p>February Kuwait continued to impose the 4 percent base rate </p><p>in effect prior to the Customs Union on products entering by </p><p>land, in addition to the 5 percent tariff levied at the point </p><p>of entry into the GCC.  As the GOK officials explained, </p><p>merchants shipping goods to Kuwait through Saudi Arabia must </p><p>pay twice -- 5 percent at the point of entry and another 4 </p><p>percent at the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Customs officials said that most merchants are </p><p>aware of this issue and try to avoid the second charge by </p><p>explaining their situation at the border.  When this fails, </p><p>exporters are forced to recover their losses, either by </p><p>charging higher prices, or by passing the additional fees </p><p>onto the importer.  Importers can use a "drawback system" to </p><p>try and recoup their losses, but often with much </p><p>inconvenience and uncertainty.  In the example given, an </p><p>importer would file with the Saudi Government to recover the </p><p>5 percent fee, a procedure that takes time and involves </p><p>administrative hoop-jumping, with no guarantee of success. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Customs officials added that many shipments are </p><p>still being inspected twice -- once upon entry into the GCC </p><p>and again upon entry into Kuwait.  The Customs Union was </p><p>intended to eliminate such duplication of efforts.  As one </p><p>GOK official admitted, "Since January 1, nothing has changed. </p><p> The Customs Union has little impact at all in Kuwait."  When </p><p>pressed, the official said that starting February 1 factories </p><p>with products from the Gulf no longer needed to register with </p><p>the GCC Secretariat, as before, but otherwise there was no </p><p>difference. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) LAW, WHAT LAW? The reason Kuwait can impose the </p><p>additional fee is that the Customs Law issued by the GCC </p><p>Council has never been passed by the GOK.  Kuwait is the lone </p><p>GCC member not to formally agree on the legal side of the </p><p>Customs Union.  Kuwait\'s National Assembly still must approve </p><p>the draft law, then forward it to the Cabinet of Ministers </p><p>for a second approval, before it reaches the Amir to be </p><p>passed into law.  Until this happens, Kuwait will continue to </p><p>operate as it did prior to the official launch of the GCC </p><p>Customs Union, according to the Head of the Kuwait Customs </p><p>Legal Office, who added that "legally, Kuwait is not really </p><p>in" the Customs Union. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The GCC Customs Law is the same for all GCC </p><p>countries.  Kuwait\'s Amir has agreed to the law in principle, </p><p>but the law has not been formally passed.  Kuwait\'s Cabinet </p><p>of Ministers can apply the law, even before its formal </p><p>ratification, but according the Customs officials this </p><p>application has not yet occurred.  The law was to have been </p><p>passed in April 2002, well ahead of the official launch, but </p><p>the National Assembly said it needed more time to consider </p><p>recommendations.  The draft law has since floundered in the </p><p>National Assembly, pushed aside by other matters deemed more </p><p>important. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In January 2003, Director General of the Customs </p><p>Office Ibrahim Al-Ghanim met with the National Assembly\'s </p><p>Finance Committee to discuss details of the customs law, in </p><p>an effort to move it forward in the wake of the new Customs </p><p>Union.  Al-Ghanim held a second meeting later that month with </p><p>legal experts to explain technical aspects of the law.  A </p><p>draft was issued, but according to Al-Ghanim the unified GCC </p><p>Customs Law has not been implemented because the National </p><p>Assembly has failed to make a formal decision. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In early January, Minister of Finance, Planning and </p><p>Development Dr. Yousef Al-Ibrahim pressed National Assembly </p><p>Speaker Jassem Al-Khorafi to place this issue before the </p><p>National Assembly, but again to no avail.  According to </p><p>Ministry of Finance official AbdulJalil, there is no telling </p><p>when the law will be passed.  He said the GOK told the GCC </p><p>Secretariat it would do so no later than April, but this </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>deadline was offered to appease the GCC and does not apply to </p><p>the National Assembly.  Given present regional concerns, new </p><p>National Assembly elections planned for some time later this </p><p>year, and the torrid summer that routinely drives most </p><p>Kuwaitis out of the country, the law may have to wait until </p><p>fall, AbdulJalil said. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) INTERIM SOLUTIONS: With this in mind, Al-Ghanim </p><p>sent a letter to the head of Saudi Customs in January asking </p><p>if products entering Kuwait could be treated as "transit" and </p><p>not incur the initial 5 percent tariff.  Under this system, </p><p>products entering Saudi Arabia from outside the GCC on their </p><p>way to Kuwait would only be charged once, when crossing into </p><p>Kuwait, yet imports originating within the GCC might still </p><p>incur two tariffs.  For example, if a car bought in the </p><p>United States was shipped to Kuwait through Qatar, it would </p><p>be charged the 5 percent unified tariff upon arrival, could </p><p>then pass free of charge through Saudi Arabia as "transit," </p><p>only to be charged another 4 percent tariff when entering </p><p>Kuwait.  While the Saudis reportedly agreed to this scheme, </p><p>the arrangement continues to cause confusion between </p><p>merchants and officials. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  Another problem presented by the fledgling Customs </p><p>Union is that Kuwait remains the only GCC country without a </p><p>compatible computer system for its customs operations.  For </p><p>now, the GOK is filling in computer forms by hand or using </p><p>manual forms, which could cause problems with year end </p><p>accounting reports.  Technical specialists have been visiting </p><p>other GCC countries to examine their systems, and Kuwait </p><p>hopes to have its own system in place by the end of summer. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) On a more positive note, the GOK is encouraged by a </p><p>new hotline system that enables border officials to call each </p><p>other and GCC directors to work out problems as they arise. </p><p>The Customs officers said that so far there have not been any </p><p>major disputes, and this system has provided a good exchange </p><p>of information and opportunities for the border workers to </p><p>learn from each other. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) COMMENT:  The GOK, in its public pronouncements, </p><p>continues to declare that the new  Customs Union is marching </p><p>along in Kuwait, whereas those on the ground realize it is </p><p>stumbling awkwardly at best.  Confusion and misunderstanding </p><p>exist at all levels, from members of the National Assembly to </p><p>border officers and merchants doing business in the country. </p><p>Lack of a new customs law signals lack of commitment on the </p><p>part of the GOK.  And while some government officials at </p><p>least seem cognizant of the problems, like so many issues in </p><p>Kuwait change will have to wait until "bukra inshallah" </p><p>(tomorrow, should God will it). </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
