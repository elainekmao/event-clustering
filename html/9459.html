Now they are shifting their attention to </p><p>      Zimbabwe, which they would like to rule through </p><p>      pseudo democracy. . .The reason being touted to the </p><p>      world in Zimbabwe is that there are human rights </p><p>      violations when infact these two western leaders </p><p>      (President George W.
