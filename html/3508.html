<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001850 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (DALTON), AF/S (SCHLACHTER), AF/RA, INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT LAND REFORM IN ZIM; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Farming: a great leap forward into </p><p>      uncertainty" the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>      dedicated its August 10 editorial to criticize the </p><p>      haphazard land reform program in Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The land reform program reached its peak this week </p><p>      with the expected departure, under Section 8, from </p><p>      their farms of all commercial farmers from </p><p>      properties designated by the government.  The legal </p><p>      challenges in the courts are of significance because </p><p>      they indicate the farmers are not taking the seizure </p><p>      of their properties lying down.  Even if they don\'t </p><p>      succeed, their message to the government is clear: </p><p>      the exercise could have been conducted with more </p><p>      decorum than it was. . .The legal challenges to the </p><p>      program suggest strongly that its fast-track element </p><p>      may have included a deliberate ploy to short-circuit </p><p>      the law relating to its implementation.  The </p><p>      suspicion of something not quite moral about it will </p><p>      linger for a long time to come.  The persecution of </p><p>      a whole race of citizens has left many Zimbabweans </p><p>      wondering about the sincerity with which the </p><p>      doctrine of reconciliation was pronounced on the eve </p><p>      of independence in 1980.  People have been told that </p><p>      when the hand of friendship was stretched out to the </p><p>      commercial farmers, they spurned it, hence the </p><p>      apparent decision to abandon the softly-softly </p><p>      approach.  Instead, a roughrider strategy was </p><p>      employed, which has culminated in. . .images of </p><p>      farmers leaving the homes they have known for </p><p>      generations with little but their memories. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
