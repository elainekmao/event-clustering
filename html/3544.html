<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002435 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MOVE SIGN OF </p><p>OBASANJO\'S GROWING WEAKNESS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER;  REASONS 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  The House of Representatives on August </p><p>13 passed a resolution demanding President Olusegun </p><p>Obasanjo resign within two weeks or face an impeachment </p><p>motion from the House.  The resolution cited a list of </p><p>deficiencies identified by the Representatives, including </p><p>the members of Obasanjo\'s own party, the People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party (PDP).  PDP officials, responding to the </p><p>ultimatum, accused the PDP House members of "anti-party" </p><p>activities for not consulting party headquarters before </p><p>supporting the motion.  Obasanjo has faced many challenges </p><p>from Nigerian legislators during his tenure, but this time </p><p>the threat comes as a result of his lack of popularity and </p><p>the impression that his quest for a second term is </p><p>weakening.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The House of Representatives held a plenary </p><p>session on August 13 to discuss the state of Nigeria and </p><p>passed a resolution tabled by Mohammed Mumalia, a member of </p><p>the opposition APP.  According to press reports, the </p><p>resolution was co-sponsored by 86 other members of the </p><p>House and "passed unanimously."  The resolution accused the </p><p>President of "monumental inadequacies, ineptitude, </p><p>persistent disrespect for rule of law and obvious </p><p>corruption." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Among the other complaints against Obasanjo are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  lack of cooperation on the 2000 budget; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  taking decisions without consulting the Legislature; </p><p>and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  frequent trips abroad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Following the announcement, the PDP, issued a </p><p>statement calling the House resolution "irresponsible and </p><p>ill-timed."  Complaining about the lack of party </p><p>discipline, PDP National Publicity Secretary Venatius Ikem </p><p>asked rhetorically: "If the House members knew all these </p><p>things, why did they keep mum all this time."  He also </p><p>demonstrated his displeasure with the PDP parliamentarians, </p><p>commenting that PDP members should have consulted the party </p><p>headquarters before taking on such an important issue.  Not </p><p>doing so, he continued, "smacked of anti-party activity." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  This is the latest volley in a series of </p><p>skirmishes between the House of Representatives and the </p><p>President.  Like the previous threats from the House, this </p><p>current move will likely fizzle.  Under the Nigerian </p><p>Constitution, impeachment is a convoluted process involving </p><p>two separate two-thirds majority votes in both houses and </p><p>the appointment of a blue-ribbon investigatory panel by the </p><p>Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  It is unlikely that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s opponents can reach and sustain super-majorities </p><p>in both Houses on two separate occasions.  The Executive or </p><p>the PDP will be able to cajole, intimidate, bribe or </p><p>otherwise discourage many members from pursuing this </p><p>course of action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  However, the motion is politically damaging.  It </p><p>shows that Obasanjo\'s critics will not let him waltz to the </p><p>party nomination and that they plan to fight him tooth-and- </p><p>nail during the PDP party convention.  Many hope that this </p><p>episode and other confrontational maneuvers will somehow </p><p>persuade Obasanjo to throw in the towel and not seek the </p><p>PDP nomination.  At this juncture, we doubt if Obasanjo </p><p>will be deterred by these machinations. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
