<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003077 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR A/S QUARLES, DAS RADELET </p><p>NSC FOR GARY EDSON, CLAY LOWERY </p><p>STATE FOR U/S LARSON, A/S WAYNE, A/S BURNS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN MINISTERS SEEK WASHINGTON MEETINGS ON </p><p>DEBT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Planning Minister Bassem Awadallah called the </p><p>Ambassador late Sunday, June 9, to say that Prime Minister </p><p>Abul Ragheb had asked that he go to Washington at the end of </p><p>this week with Minister of State for Economic Affairs </p><p>Mohammed Halaiqah.  Awadallah hopes to join Halaiqah (who has </p><p>been invited separately to address an Inter-American </p><p>Development Bank conference) in meetings with U.S. officials </p><p>to renew discussions begun during King Abdullah\'s visit last </p><p>month of Jordan\'s request for Paris Club debt relief.  They </p><p>will be in Washington on Thursday and Friday, June 13 and 14. </p><p> The Jordanian embassy should be in touch to arrange </p><p>appoinments at State, Treasury, and the NSC. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  This is part of a pre-IMF Board meeting push by the </p><p>GOJ to gain Paris Club members\' support for the stock of debt </p><p>"reprofiling" they are seeking from the Paris Club.  The King </p><p>and/or senior ministers will also be going to London, Berlin, </p><p>Vienna, Rome and Tokyo before the end of the month.   We have </p><p>been candid in explaining to senior Jordanians, including </p><p>Awadallah and Halaiqah, as well as the King, the Prime </p><p>Minister, Foreign Minister Muasher, and Finance Minister </p><p>Marto, that hopes for such a treatment are unrealistic. </p><p>Nonetheless, these senior officials continue believe that if </p><p>they remain persistent, they will be able to overcome Paris </p><p>Club members\' objections.  To bolster their economic case, </p><p>the Finance Ministry has used updated projections that will </p><p>appear in the new IMF program papers to prepare a new </p><p>financial outlook through 2007 that Halaiqah and Awadallah </p><p>should be ready to discuss in Washington.  They should also </p><p>be able to comment on at least some of the Jordanian meetings </p><p>with other Paris Club members. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
