<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008250 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES EU AND CYPRUS WITH </p><p>SOLANA, NOV. 14 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador met Nov. 14 with EU Hirep Javier Solana to </p><p>discuss the EU perspective on UNSYG Annan\'s plan for a </p><p>settlement on Cyprus, and the prospects for progress on </p><p>Turkey\'s EU bid at Copenhagen in December.  Solana noted that </p><p>he had had separate meetings with MFA U/S Ziyal and AK </p><p>(Justice and Development) Party leader Erdogan.  He told both </p><p>Ziyal and Erdogan that the best time for a deal on Cyprus is </p><p>now, and urged them both to get to work hard to "realize </p><p>their dreams." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Solana offered that there are several factors at work </p><p>that could contribute to progress on Cyprus, and thus to </p><p>Turkey\'s EU prospects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- He told both Erdogan and Ziyal that Turkey would be hard </p><p>pressed to find better, more reasonable people on Cyprus </p><p>issues than UNSYG Annan and Greek PM Simitis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In Solana\'s view, Ziyal understands the stakes and will </p><p>push his bureaucracy as hard as he can toward a settlement. </p><p>Ziyal, he added, is encouraged: 1) by the imminent departure </p><p>of the lame-duck, hawkish Ecevit caretaker government; 2) </p><p>that the inertial "TRNC President" Denktas has been largely </p><p>sidelined due to his health problems; and 3) that AK, with </p><p>its huge Parliamentary majority, has no fixed view on Cyprus, </p><p>which provides for some potential flexibility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Erdogan also appears committed to moving ahead on Cyprus, </p><p>though Solana volunteered that he was not sure about "the </p><p>white haired fellow" advising the AK leader.  (Comment: </p><p>Solana was referring to Yasar Yakis, the </p><p>conventionally-minded retired MFA careerist who is now AK </p><p>Vice Chairman for foreign affairs -- that is, barbarian </p><p>handler/liaison to the Kemalist foreign policy establishment. </p><p> End comment).  Solana opined that caretaker FM Gurel\'s </p><p>public criticism of the UNSYG plan could cause some political </p><p>problems for Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Solana told his Turkish interlocutors that moving ahead on </p><p>ESDP is not a precondition for a decision by the EU at </p><p>Copenhagen to announce a date to begin formal accession </p><p>talks, but that it would send the right signal as to Turkey\'s </p><p>willingness to comply with EU requirements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Solana emphasized that he did not want to oversell </p><p>either the prospects for a solution on Cyprus or for Turkey\'s </p><p>EU candidacy, noting that the internal EU debate on Turkey </p><p>would be a contentious one in any event.  He thought that a </p><p>visit by Prodi to Turkey before Copenhagen would be </p><p>inappropriate, but that perhaps Verheugen could come to </p><p>Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: While Solana\'s tough message to the Turks </p><p>contained nothing substantively new, he appeared to come away </p><p>from his meetings here encouraged that the next GOT will at a </p><p>minimum be more willing than the Ecevit crew to consider </p><p>moving ahead on Cyprus.  It is not clear, however, that he </p><p>did a lot of listening.  He was mainly in transmit. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
