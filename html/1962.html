<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002677 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AA/AFR, BHR/FFP, AFR/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP GATHERS KEY MEMBERS OF DIP CORPS; SOFT POSTURE </p><p>TOWARD GOZ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY. ON SEPTEMBER 6, UNDP BRIEFED DIPLOMATS ON LAND, </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND ELECTIONS.  WHILE LITTLE NEW </p><p>INFORMATION CONCERNING THE LAND AND FOOD SITUATION WAS </p><p>PRESENTED, THE PICTURE PAINTED BY UNDP RESREP VICTOR ANGELO </p><p>WAS BLEAK. HE WAS ENCOURAGED REGARDING VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>MSIKA\'S STATEMENTS ON THE ZJRI; HOWEVER, OTHER PARTICIPANTS </p><p>WERE MORE SKEPTICAL.  UNDP ANNOUNCED GOZ AGREEMENT TO ENTER </p><p>INTO DISCUSSIONS ON DEVELOPING A METHODOLOGY FOR AN </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE LAND SITUATION.  THE RESREP ALSO SAID NO </p><p>GOZ REQUEST FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS HAD BEEN RECEIVED AND, FURTHERMORE, THAT NO </p><p>REQUEST WAS EXPECTED.  HE POINTED TO GOZ AGREEMENT TO ALLOW </p><p>THE UNDP TO ESTABLISH A RELIEF AND REHABILITATION </p><p>SECRETARIAT TO COORDINATE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AS THE MOST POSITIVE RECENT DEVELOPMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AT A MEETING HELD AT UNDP ON THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 6, </p><p>SELECTED DIPLOMATS DISCUSSED THREE AGENDA ITEMS:  LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT, THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION, AND UPCOMING </p><p>ELECTIONS.  UNDP HOSTED TWO OTHER MEETINGS THE SAME DAY, ONE </p><p>WITH NGOS TO DISCUSS THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE EFFORTS AND </p><p>ONE WITH THE SADC AMBASSADORS, PRESUMABLY WITH THE SAME </p><p>AGENDA AS THE MEETING TO WHICH THE U.S. WAS INVITED.  THE </p><p>U.S. WAS REPRESENTED BY THE CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES AND THE USAID </p><p>DIRECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ANGELO SHARED WITH PARTICIPANTS A MEMORANDUM OF </p><p>UNDERSTANDING SIGNED BY HIMSELF AND THE PERMANENT SECRETARY </p><p>OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  THE MOU COVERED: (1) GOZ AGREEMENT TO </p><p>DESIGN THE METHODOLOGY AND MECHANISMS FOR "A POSSIBLE DATA </p><p>GATHERING MECHANISM FOR THE LAND REFORM PROGRAM"; (2) </p><p>RECOGNITION THAT THERE ARE REQUIRED SOCIAL AND RELIEF </p><p>ACTIVITIES "GIVEN THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF TRANSFORMATION" </p><p>AND THE RECENT DROUGHTS AND FLOODS; AND (3) UNDP\'S AGREEMENT </p><p>THAT, GIVEN GOZ ACCEPTANCE OF THE ZIMBABWE JOINT </p><p>RESETTLEMENT INITIATIVE (ZJRI), UNDP "AGREED TO CONTINUE </p><p>PROVIDING SUPPORT" FOR THE INITIATIVE "AND OTHERS THAT ARE </p><p>AIMED AT SEEKING SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE </p><p>CHALLENGES FACING THE COUNTRY."  THE DISCUSSION THEN </p><p>MOVED TO THE THREE AGENDA TOPICS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02677  01 OF 02  120906Z </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>LAND </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ANGELO DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY IN BLEAK </p><p>TERMS.  HE SAID THAT MEMBERS OF THE CFU WERE "AGAINST THE </p><p>WALL" AND THAT NORMAL OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE LAND </p><p>PREPARATION FOR NEXT SEASON, ARE BASICALLY AT A STANDSTILL. </p><p>FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF COMMUNAL FARMERS, WHO HAD BEEN </p><p>"RESETTLED," LITTLE SUPPORT WAS AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF INPUTS </p><p>AND TILLAGE.  MEANWHILE, EXTENSIVE BURNING OF PASTURES AND </p><p>TREE CUTTING WERE UNDERWAY.  OFFICIAL FIGURES FOR THOSE </p><p>RESETTLED TOTAL 197,617 FAMILIES, BUT ANGELO SAID ESTIMATES </p><p>OF ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE MORE LIKELY 7,900 INDIVIDUALS. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, WHILE PRECISE NUMBERS ARE NOT </p><p>KNOWN, THERE ARE NOW AN ESTIMATED 25-30,000 DISPLACED FARM </p><p>WORKERS.  WHILE THE GOZ IS CURRENTLY DE-LISTING, THE CFU </p><p>REPORTS THAT 85% OF COMMERCIAL FARMS CURRENTLY REMAIN </p><p>LISTED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE RESREP PRAISED THE POSITIVE STATEMENT OF VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT MSIKA, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE LAND TASK FORCE, </p><p>REGARDING THE ZJRI.  THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE VERIFIES THE AUTHENTICITY OF ALMOST </p><p>1.0 MILLION HECTARES (967,452) OFFERED BY THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS, STATES THAT THE "WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS APPEAR TO </p><p>HAVE TURNED A NEW LEAF IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT LAND REFORM PROGRAM," AND OBSERVED THAT </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS HAVE COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO IDENTIFYING </p><p>ADDITIONAL LAND AS WELL AS WITHDRAWING LEGAL CONTEXT TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02677  01 OF 02  120906Z </p><p>ACQUISITION OF SOME 410,000 HECTARES.   (NB: ALL OF THE LAND </p><p>"OFFERED" IS ALREADY LISTED.)  THE RESREP REPORTED ON THE </p><p>CONCRETE FINANCIAL OFFERS FOR INPUTS, TILLAGE AND FROM </p><p>COMMERCIAL BANKS, BUT HE DID NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR EITHER LAND OR IMPROVEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT.  WHILE THE RESREP CHARACTERIZED MSIKA\'S </p><p>STATEMENT AS VERY HOPEFUL AND EVEN CAUTIONED DIPLOMATS BY </p><p>SAYING, "I DON\'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TAKE THE CYNICAL VIEW </p><p>THAT THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE ABUJA MEETING," MANY OF HIS </p><p>INVITEES REMAINED SKEPTICAL. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SITUATION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  ANGELO ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOZ HAS AGREED TO THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RELIEF AND REHABILITATION SECRETARIAT </p><p>AT THE UNDP.  THIS RECONCILIATION HAD BEEN DESPITE THE FACT </p><p>THAT DONORS HAD ALREADY MADE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6362 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02677  02 OF 02  120906Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  TEST-00  DSCC-00  PRM-01   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /001W </p><p>                  ------------------1DD570  120906Z /38 </p><p>P 120850Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9686 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002677 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AA/AFR, BHR/FFP, AFR/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  EAID, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP GATHERS KEY MEMBERS OF DIP CORPS; SOFT POSTURE </p><p>TOWARD GOZ </p><p> </p><p>SECRETARIAT, BUT THE MOFA AGREEMENT CLEARS THE WAY FOR THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SECRETARIAT TO BEGIN WORK OFFICIALLY.  THE MANDATE AS SET </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>FORTH IN THE MOU ALLOWS UNDP TO CONSIDER FACILITATING </p><p>FORMATION OF A PROGRAM, TO CONTINUE CONSULTING WITH DONORS, </p><p>AND TO STRENGTHEN ITS SUBSTANTIVE AND OPERATIONAL CAPACITY </p><p>IN THE AREA OF RELIEF ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, ANGELO REMINDED DONORS THAT </p><p>FOOD WAS ONLY ONE PART OF A HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE AND THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02677  02 OF 02  120906Z </p><p>UNDP HAD DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK.  HE CAUTIONED </p><p>AGAINST ANYONE WORKING OUTSIDE OF THIS, NOTING THAT </p><p>INDEPENDENT ACTIONS WOULD CREATE CONFUSION.  HE ALSO NOTED </p><p>THAT WORKING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK GAVE UNDP LEVERAGE TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE THE POLICY ISSUES.  COMMENT: THIS WAS A NOT TOO </p><p>SUBTLE PITCH FOR BILATERAL RESOURCES TO BE FUNNELED THROUGH </p><p>UN AGENCIES.  WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THESE MECHANISMS COULD </p><p>PROVE TO BE TOO PONDEROUS TO BE PUT IN PLACE QUICKLY AND </p><p>THAT WE SHOULD THUS CONTINUE TO MOVE AHEAD BILATERALLY, </p><p>WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SEEKING WAYS TO COLLABORATE IN THE </p><p>MULTILATERAL FRAMEWORK. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SEVERAL PARTICIPANTS POSED QUESTIONS.  THE JAPANESE </p><p>AMBASSADOR STATED THAT THE GOZ HAD NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE MOU </p><p>THAT HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE WAS NEEDED DUE TO </p><p>A MAN-MADE CRISIS, TO WHICH THE RESREP RESPONDED BY POINTING </p><p>TO THE LANGUAGE CONCERNING "CONDITIONS OF TRANSFORMATION," </p><p>SAYING THAT THIS LANGUAGE WAS TACIT RECOGNITION OF THE </p><p>CAUSES.   WHEN ASKED BY THE AMBASSADOR OF BELGIUM HOW THE </p><p>ZJRI RELATED TO THE "FAST TRACK," THE RESPONSE WAS "WE ARE </p><p>LIVING IN PARALLEL UNIVERSES." </p><p> </p><p>10.  ON THE ISSUE OF POLITICIZATION OF FOOD AID, ANGELO </p><p>REPORTED THAT THE UN WILL NOT BE INVOLVED IN THE USE OF FOOD </p><p>AID FOR PARTISAN PURPOSES.  HE SAID THAT THEY HAVE TOLD THE </p><p>GOZ THIS, BUT THAT TO DATE THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN "YOU HAVE </p><p>TO GO THROUGH US."  IN TERMS OF TOTAL REQUIREMENT, THERE WAS </p><p>NO NEW INFORMATION ON FOOD AVAILABILITIES IN COUNTRY. </p><p>WHILE, ANGELO WAS MORE PESSIMISTIC THAN WE ARE ABOUT THE </p><p>WHEAT SITUATION, THE WORLD BANK RESREP INFORMED USAID </p><p>DIRECTOR AFTER THE MEETING THAT AN ORDER FOR 100,000 MT OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02677  02 OF 02  120906Z </p><p>WHEAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PLACED IN SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>11.  ANGELO PROMISED THAT THE FIRST SITUATION REPORT FROM </p><p>THE R&R SECRETARIAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO BOTH THE GOZ AND </p><p>DONORS NEXT WEEK AND EVERY TWO WEEKS THEREAFTER. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE UNDP RESREP REPORTED THAT THE POLITBURO HAS ADVISED </p><p>THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY PREFER EARLY ELECTIONS. </p><p>ON UN\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS, THE RESREP </p><p>SAID THAT, "THERE IS NO FORMAL REQUEST TO BE INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>ELECTIONS AND WE DON\'T EXPECT TO RECEIVE ONE.  WITHOUT SUCH </p><p>A REQUEST THE UN WILL NOT BE INVOLVED." </p><p> </p><p>13.  ON THE QUESTION OF TIMING, THE RESREP SAID THAT THE UN </p><p>REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF THREE MONTHS NOTICE.  THE BOTTOM LINE </p><p>FOR THE UN WAS, "IT\'S NOW OR NEVER."  IF A REQUEST IS NOT </p><p>FORTHCOMING IN A MATTER OF DAYS OR A FEW WEEKS AT MOST, THE </p><p>UN WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY ELECTION OBSERVATION OR </p><p>RELATED ELECTORAL ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>END COMMENT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  WHILE PARTICIPANTS APPRECIATED THE RESREP\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>KEEP DIPLOMATS INFORMED, THERE WAS A DEGREE OF SKEPTICISM </p><p>AMONG THE DONORS.  SEVERAL EXPRESSED POST MEETING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02677  02 OF 02  120906Z </p><p>DISSATISFACTION WITH BOTH HOW THE EVENT WAS STRUCTURED (THE </p><p>RESREP DOES 90 PERCENT OF THE TALKING WITH NO REAL GIVE-AND- </p><p>TAKE OR OPPORTUNITY FOR POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE </p><p>DONORS) AND SEVERAL REMARKS MADE BY THE CHAIR OF THE </p><p>MEETING.  IN PARTICULAR, ANGELO\'S CHARACTERIZATION OF </p><p>MSIKA\'S STATEMENT ON ZJRI, AND HIS CAUTION THAT THE DONORS </p><p>"SHOULD NOT TAKE A CYNICAL VIEW OF THIS BECAUSE OF THE ABUJA </p><p>MEETING," WAS GREETED WITH WIDESPREAD SKEPTICISM. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
