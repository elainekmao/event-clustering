<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001510 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PDA (MBUCKLEY); WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON DRUG TRAFFICKING, JUNE 26, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Article in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" </p><p>on 6/26 entitled "U.S. Ambassador doesn\'t see results </p><p>against narcos." "U.S. Ambassador Larry Palmer affirmed that </p><p>his government, just like the rest of Hondurans, expects to </p><p>see positive results in the fight against narco- </p><p>trafficking." </p><p> </p><p>"The Ambassador stated, `We want results: drug seizures, </p><p>arrests of narco traffickers and convictions for those </p><p>responsible of such acts. we are deeply concerned with the </p><p>recent rise of organized crime and narco trafficking\'." </p><p> </p><p>"He added, `More than a year ago, the Embassy received an </p><p>anonymous report that gives names of many people linked to </p><p>narco-trafficking and organized crime. We\'d like to see a </p><p>thorough investigation by the Honduran authorities to find </p><p>out whether those allegations are true or not; the Honduran </p><p>people are entitled to know\'." </p><p> </p><p>"Concerning the arrest of Cesar Diaz, the Honduran member of </p><p>the Central American Parliament who was arrested in </p><p>Nicaragua with 7 kilos of heroin, he declared `it is more </p><p>important what comes after his apprehension. I hope the </p><p>Honduran authorities do their best to penalize rigorously </p><p>those responsible for narco-trafficking\'." </p><p> </p><p>2. Article in San Pedro Sula-based liberal daily "La Prensa" </p><p>on 6/26 entitled "The U.S. demands the maximum penalty for </p><p>narcos". "U.S. Ambassador Larry Palmer sent a clear </p><p>challenge to the Judicial branch, the police and the General </p><p>Attorney\'s Office: seize more drugs and penalize drug </p><p>traffickers with the maximum penalty." </p><p> </p><p>"In a press conference, Palmer affirmed, `The police and the </p><p>General Attorney Office\'s are responsible for finding out </p><p>the whereabouts of narco-traffickers. We expect positive </p><p>results from their task\'." </p><p> </p><p>"About the arrest of Congressman Cesar Diaz, the Ambassador </p><p>stated that the behavior of one person can\'t affect the </p><p>image of the whole country. He declared that the important </p><p>thing is that those guilty of these crimes must be severely </p><p>punished by law." </p><p> </p><p>3. Article in "La Tribuna" on 6/26 entitled "U.S. aid is </p><p>only enough for their advisors". "The coordinator of </p><p>prosecutors of the Attorney General Office, Humberto </p><p>Palacios Moya, said that they will only keep arresting minor </p><p>users of marijuana and cocaine if the U.S. doesn\'t help to </p><p>improve their logistical structures." </p><p> </p><p>"Palacios affirmed, `The anti-narcotics police has only 29 </p><p>agents for the whole country, we have said this to the </p><p>National Congress and the U.S. Embassy but their answer is </p><p>that they have given enough money for the fight against </p><p>drugs. what the Americans do not say is that their money </p><p>mainly goes to the DEA advisors and other international </p><p>organizations\'." </p><p> </p><p>4. Article in "La Tribuna" on 6/26 entitled "The Attorney </p><p>General\'s Office is also infiltrated". "Alfredo Landaverde, </p><p>former Executive Director of the National Council against </p><p>Narco Trafficking, challenged governmental authorities to </p><p>categorically face narco-trafficking, one of the most </p><p>dangerous branches of organized crime." </p><p> </p><p>"Concerning the infiltration of organized crime in the </p><p>country\'s security forces, he emphatically affirmed, `many </p><p>policemen have personally told me they are afraid of some of </p><p>their colleagues because they know they work for criminal </p><p>organizations. Honduras has a few good prosecutors, judges </p><p>and policemen determined to fight against organized crime </p><p>but beside them, we can also find infiltrated officials\'." </p><p> </p><p>"He added, `I know they will call me once again to confirm </p><p>those accusations. Then, I guess they will also call the </p><p>U.S. embassy\'s DCM Roger Pierce for saying that as well\'." </p><p> </p><p>5. Article in "La Tribuna" on 6/26 entitled "Four Colombians </p><p>are arrested in narco plane case". "Four Colombians and two </p><p>Hondurans were arrested and accused for being tied with the </p><p>narco organizations operating in the region of Colon, which </p><p>recently burned and destroyed a plane that was used to </p><p>transport 500 kilos of cocaine, apparently from Colombia". </p><p> </p><p>6. Article in "La Prensa" on 6/26 entitled "Maduro asks the </p><p>U.S. for help". "President Maduro stated that the fight </p><p>against drug trafficking is much more difficult for a poor </p><p>country like Honduras, and `that is why I\'m asking the U.S. </p><p>which has always been an extraordinary ally, to increase its </p><p>support on this issue. this campaign requires a lot of money </p><p>and we need the help of a big country like the U.S.\'." </p><p> </p><p>"Maduro declared, `. the fight against drug trafficking </p><p>demands sophisticated equipment, such as radars and special </p><p>vehicles the country can\'t afford because public funds are </p><p>used to address other priorities, such as the fight against </p><p>crime and health and education programs\'." </p><p> </p><p>7. Article in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" </p><p>on 6/26 entitled "The U.S. should aid more". "President </p><p>Maduro stated the United States has helped, but not in the </p><p>degree this country needs for accomplishable results. </p><p>Ambassador Larry Palmer replied, `the Honduran public has </p><p>the right to know and if they determine these allegations to </p><p>be true, then we want the guilty to receive the maximum </p><p>penalty of the law.  I won\'t be satisfied until all drug- </p><p>traffickers are in jail, but it\'s a pretty hard fight\'." </p><p> </p><p>"Maduro added, `Honduras needs more help because the public </p><p>funds go towards teenage delinquency and education systems. </p><p>money and sophisticated equipment are needed for this </p><p>project, and the amount of money Honduras currently has is </p><p>not enough to cover certain needs\'." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
