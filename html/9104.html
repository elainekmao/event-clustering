<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004177 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EUR/PGI, OES/PCI, OES/IHA (GALLAGHER, </p><p>DILDAY) </p><p>PLEASE PASS EPA (BFREEMAN, HHUYNH), HHS (FIC) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, TBIO, PGOV, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  STATUS OF HIV/AIDS: LOW PREVALENCE, LOW PRIOIRTY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  SECSTATE 14643 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Post used the delivery of Ref A materials on the </p><p>President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to obtain updated </p><p>information on HIV/AIDS in Turkey from the Ministry of </p><p>Health (MOH), Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UN Population </p><p>Fund.  The institutions appreciated receiving the materials, </p><p>acknowledged U.S. leadership in HIV/AIDS programming, and </p><p>agree that developed nations need to provide support for </p><p>AIDS prevention.  The MOH requested that Turkey be </p><p>considered for participation in any worldwide training that </p><p>might be offered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Incidence of HIV/AIDS is low </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The MOH General Directorate of Primary Health Care </p><p>reports that at the end of 2002, there were 1,515 HIV/AIDS </p><p>cases in Turkey: 1,063 HIV and 452 AIDS.  Since 1992, those </p><p>numbers have been relatively stable, with fewer than 50 new </p><p>AIDS cases reported each year.  The incidence of new HIV </p><p>cases have been low but steady since 1997, with the greatest </p><p>increase in 2001 of 144 new cases.  There were 142 new HIV </p><p>cases in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Seventy (70) percent of HIV/AIDS patients are male. </p><p>Most are between the ages of 20 and 39.  The source of about </p><p>half the cases is heterosexual contact. Drug use accounts </p><p>for about 6.5 percent of the cases and blood transfusions </p><p>for less than three (3) percent. The source of about a third </p><p>of the cases is considered unknown. Istanbul has the highest </p><p>prevalence of HIV/AIDS cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Healthcare professionals acknowledge that there are </p><p>insufficient mechanisms for tracking HIV/AIDS patients and </p><p>that an inadequate legislative base leads to under </p><p>reporting.  In 2002, a representative from the CDC office of </p><p>Public Health and Practice found that Turkey has literally </p><p>no system for monitoring any infectious disease, let alone </p><p>HIV.  The World Health Organization estimates that Turkey\'s </p><p>HIV/AIDS incidence estimates are likely to be off by a </p><p>factor of 50. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Key Milestones, Programs </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  MOH became active in AIDS prevention upon detecting the </p><p>first case in Turkey in 1985.  AIDS testing began back then </p><p>and is now offered free of charge.  Over the years, outreach </p><p>expanded to include establishing a National Advisory </p><p>Committee, supporting sexual health education in schools, </p><p>distributing free condoms, providing disposable syringes, </p><p>covering health care costs for patients, and instituting a </p><p>telephone information line. Provincial health managers have </p><p>received training in sexually transmitted diseases.  (Note: </p><p>Some programs offered are costly, yet MOH officials could </p><p>not provide a budget estimate for HIV/AIDS prevention, </p><p>treatment or testing.  End note.) Turkey also works </p><p>cooperatively with international organizations such as WHO, </p><p>UNFPA, UNICEF, and UNAIDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  In 1996, GOT formed a multi-sectoral National AIDS </p><p>Committee (NAC).  The Prime Minister leads it, MOH supports </p><p>it, and 32 ministries, institutions, professional </p><p>associations, and NGOs are represented on it.  The NAC </p><p>adopted the country\'s first National Strategic Action Plan </p><p>last year.  Its primary goals are to educate the public, </p><p>ensure safe blood supply, standardize testing, provide </p><p>counseling, ensure legislation is respectful to individuals, </p><p>and improve monitoring.  The NAC will monitor these targets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Low Prevalence, Low Priority </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Despite these efforts, Turkey\'s HIV/AIDS infrastructure </p><p>operates at a minimal level.  Post\'s healthcare provider </p><p>finds that Turkey has demonstrated minimal commitment to </p><p>following accepted epidemiological procedures. </p><p>Professionals are insufficiently trained, data are </p><p>unreliable and public awareness is low.  Mission employees </p><p>rarely see any of the public educational materials </p><p>purportedly disseminated on the media and in schools.  Even </p><p>with the Prime Minister heading the NAC, most professionals </p><p>agree that policy-makers rate HIV/AIDS a low priority. </p><p>Turkey did not participate in the XIV International AIDS </p><p>conference in Barcelona in July 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  That said, MOH has submitted a $6.5 million proposal to </p><p>the Global AIDS Fund.  Winning such a grant would provide </p><p>the boost needed to fully implement Turkey\'s national </p><p>strategic action plan and invigorate education, prevention </p><p>and treatment programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Thus far, Turkey seems to have dodged the HIV/AIDS </p><p>bullet.  Some attribute this to conservative family values, </p><p>others to geographic luck.  But this luck might not </p><p>continue.  The inability to track the sex-trade industry, </p><p>prevent heroin trafficking from Afghanistan, and stem the </p><p>tide of a potentially exponentially increasing epidemic over </p><p>time requires vigilance, support, and a higher priority than </p><p>HIV/AIDS now receives. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
