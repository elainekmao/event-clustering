<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 09 USUN NEW YORK 000768 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UNSC, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ:  COUNCIL CLOSES ONE CHAPTER IN IRAQI DISARMAMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. USUN 763 </p><p>     B. USUN 766 </p><p>     C. USUN 764 </p><p>     D. USUN 765 </p><p>     E. USUN 760 </p><p>     F. USUN 762 </p><p>     G. USUN 761 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT; </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  IN A FRANKLY ANTI-CLIMATIC CONCLUSION TO THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL\'S ROLE IN DEBATING THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, </p><p>THE COUNCIL HELD AN OPEN SESSION MARCH 19 ATTENDED BY </p><p>MINISTERS FROM FRANCE, GERMANY, RUSSIA, SYRIA, AND GUINEA. </p><p>(GUINEAN FM FALL WAS IN NEW YORK TO PRESIDE OVER THE COUNCIL </p><p>SESSION ON SMALL ARMS AND MERCENARIES IN AFRICA WEDNESDAY, </p><p>AND REMAINED FOR THE MEETING.)  WHILE DIVISIVENESS AMONG </p><p>COUNCIL MEMBERS WAS MUTED, MARKING MOVEMENT TO MINIMIZE </p><p>DIFFERENCES, NATIONAL STATEMENTS NONETHELESS REFLECTED </p><p>CLASSICAL POSTURES ON IRAQ, LIKELY TO RESURFACE IN UPCOMING </p><p>COUNCIL DIALOGUES ABOUT OIL-FOR-FOOD (OFF) AND OTHER NEXT </p><p>STEPS.  ALTHOUGH THE PRESS SPOTLIGHT ON THE COUNCIL HAD </p><p>LARGELY DIMMED EVEN BEFORE THE MEETING, MOST COUNCIL MEMBERS </p><p>-- EXCLUSIVE OF THE U.S., UK, AND SPAIN -- DEFENSIVELY </p><p>POSTURED ABOUT THE RELEVANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF BOTH THE </p><p>COUNCIL AND, MORE BROADLY, THE UNITED NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BLIX ACKNOWLEDGED THE LIMITED RELEVANCE OF THE DRAFT </p><p>PROGRAM OF WORK BEFORE THE COUNCIL, WHILE SYG ANNAN MET HEAD </p><p>ON THE FACT THAT HUMANITARIAN CHALLENGES WOULD ARISE FROM </p><p>MILITARY CONFLICT.  BOTH AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE AND UK PERMREP </p><p>GREENSTOCK SPOKE TO STEPS ALREADY TAKEN IN PREPARING FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN NEEDS, WHILE SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS SET OUT </p><p>SUCCINCTLY AND CLEARLY SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S PATH TOWARDS </p><p>CONFRONTATION.  FRENCH FM DE VILLEPIN SET OUT TWO ALTERNATE </p><p>APPROACHES IN THE WORLD TODAY: THE USE OF FORCE TO SOLVE </p><p>COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND, BY WAY OF CONTRAST, A LONG-TERM </p><p>APPROACH WHICH RECOGNIZED THAT ALL ASPECTS, INCLUDING </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL, NEEDED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. </p><p>THAT SAID, FRANCE WOULD BE A "FULL PARTICIPANT IN STANCHING </p><p>THE WOUNDS OF WAR."  RUSSIAN FM IVANOV REJECTED ANY LINKAGE </p><p>BETWEEN 9/11 AND IRAQ, AS WELL AS ANY LEGITIMACY OTHER THAN </p><p>THAT CONFERRED BY THE COUNCIL FOR THE USE OF FORCE.  GERMAN </p><p>FM FISCHER DEFENDED THE COUNCIL AND REITERATED GERMAN </p><p>OPPOSITION TO ANY MILITARY SOLUTION, STRESSING THAT PROGRESS </p><p>WAS BEING MADE.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SYRIAN FM SHARA\'S </p><p>RHETORICAL STATEMENT, OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS\' STATEMENTS WERE </p><p>LARGELY UNREMARKABLE, GROUPED AROUND SEVERAL MAIN THEMES: </p><p>THE COUNCIL\'S ROLE AND LEGITIMACY, PREFERENCE FOR A PEACEFUL </p><p>SOLUTION BUT RECOGNITION THAT SUCH HAD FAILED, AND IMPERATIVE </p><p>TO SAFEGUARD THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION TO THE GREATEST </p><p>EXTENT POSSIBLE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S., UK, SPAIN, BULGARIA:  RESOLUTE, BUT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>AVOIDED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S.: FOCUS FORWARD ON HUMANITARIAN ASPECTS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THANKED UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA FOR </p><p>THEIR WORK PROGRAMS AND THEIR EFFORTS, BUT POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>IMMEDIATE APPROVAL OF THEIR WORK PROGRAMS WAS INCOMPATIBLE </p><p>WITH THE CURRENT LEVEL OF IRAQI COOPERATION AND PREMATURE </p><p>GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE GROUND.  HE ASKED THAT THE </p><p>WORK PROGRAM BE SET ASIDE FOR THE TIME BEING, BUT SAID THE </p><p>UNITED STATES DID NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT MAY </p><p>PROVE USEFUL TO RETURN TO THESE DOCUMENTS AT SOME TIME IN THE </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THEN TURNED THE COUNCIL\'S </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE FUTURE, AND THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF THE </p><p>IRAQI PEOPLE IN THE TIME AHEAD.   HE TOUCHED ON U.S. PLANNING </p><p>EFFORTS, ANNOUNCED THE DISPATCH OF A DISASTER ASSISTANCE </p><p>RESPONSE TEAM (DART), THE PRE-POSITIONING OF USD 16.5 MILLION </p><p>IN SUPPLIES, AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF USD 60 MILLION TO UN </p><p>AGENCIES. HE SAID THE U.S. WOULD INCREASE DONATIONS, AND </p><p>URGED OTHER DONORS TO DO LIKEWISE.  AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. WOULD SOON PRESENT A DRAFT </p><p>HUMANITARIAN RESOLUTION TO ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF THE </p><p>OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM.  HE ENDED BY EXPRESSING U.S. READINESS </p><p>TO WORK WITH THE COUNCIL ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE SITUATION </p><p>IN IRAQ IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) FULL TEXT OF AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE\'S REMARKS SENT REF A. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UK: LOOKING AHEAD </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) UK PR GREENSTOCK SAID THE UK HAD TRIED HARD TO AVERT </p><p>CONFLICT AND SEE TO IRAQ\'S PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, BUT THAT </p><p>IRAQ FOR TWELVE YEARS HAD FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE COUNCIL\'S </p><p>PLEAS OR DEMANDS.  HE OBSERVED THAT, IF IRAQ HAD RESPECTED </p><p>THE UN, THE COUNTRY WOULD NOT BE FACING HOSTILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) GREENSTOCK ARGUED THAT THE UN HAD TO PLAY A ROLE IN </p><p>IRAQ\'S FUTURE, AND QUOTED UK FS STRAW\'S MARCH 17 COMMENTS </p><p>REGARDING SAFEGUARDING IRAQ\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, THE </p><p>LIFTING OF SANCTIONS, AND THE RIGHT OF IRAQ\'S PEOPLE TO </p><p>IRAQ\'S OIL WEALTH.  GREENSTOCK EXPRESSED THE UK\'S SUPPORT FOR </p><p>RECONFIGURING OFF AND SAID HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE </p><p>PRESENTATION OF IDEAS BY THE SYG.  HE ALSO ADVOCATED FUTURE </p><p>ROLES FOR UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA IN ASSESSING IRAQI WMD PLANS </p><p>AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ONGOING MONITORING SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) GREENSTOCK ANNOUNCED THAT THE HMG MINISTER FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WAS IN NEW YORK ON MARCH 19 AND </p><p>THAT THE UK WOULD BE DONATING USD 110 MILLION FOR IMMEDIATE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN RELIEF AND WOULD BE LIKELY TO DONATE MORE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) TURNING TO THE UNMOVIC WORK PROGRAM AND KEY REMAINING </p><p>DISARMAMENT TASKS, GREENSTOCK SAID THAT SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE A COOPERATING IRAQI GOVERNMENT.  BOTH WORK PROGRAMS </p><p>SHOULD BE KEPT UNDER REVIEW, READY TO BE USED WITH AN IRAQI </p><p>GOVERNMENT PREPARED TO COOPERATE ACTIVELY, IMMEDIATELY, AND </p><p>UNCONDITIONALLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN: SADDAM\'S PATH OF CONFRONTATION </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS, WHILE COMMENDING THE WORK OF </p><p>THE INSPECTORS, SQUARELY BLAMED SADDAM HUSSEIN FOR THE </p><p>SUSPENSION OF INSPECTIONS.  HE STATED: </p><p> </p><p>-- SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD OPENLY CHOSEN THE PATH OF </p><p>CONFRONTATION, AND HE ALONE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>CONFRONTING THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES LAID OUT IN UNSC </p><p>RESOLUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF USNCR 1441 CHANGED THE PARADIGM </p><p>OF INSPECTIONS UNDER UNSCR 1284 AND THE PROGRAM OF WORK. </p><p>WITHOUT FULL COOPERATION FROM IRAQ, THE WORK PROGRAM WOULD </p><p>NOT BE POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- TOGETHER WITH THE U.S. AND UK, SPAIN HAD TRIED TO ACHIEVE </p><p>A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE IRAQI CRISIS THROUGH INCREASED </p><p>PRESSURE FOR IRAQ TO MAKE A "STRATEGIC DECISION" TO COOPERATE </p><p>FULLY WITH INSPECTORS.  IRAQ HAD FAILED TO TAKE ITS FINAL </p><p>OPPORTUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- SPAIN BELIEVED, HOWEVER, THAT A NEW RESOLUTION WAS NOT </p><p>NECESSARY BECAUSE THE LEGAL BASIS FOR FORCE WAS GIVEN IN </p><p>UNSCRS 660, 678, 687 AND 1441. </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAQ HAD NOT MET ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER UNSCR 687, </p><p>INCLUDING CONTINUING TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- AT THIS LATE STAGE, IRAQ HAD FAILED TO SUBMIT A FULL </p><p>ACCOUNT OF ITS WMD DEMANDED BY PARAGRAPH NINE OF UNSCR 687, </p><p>AND LATER EMPHASIZED IN UNSCR 1441. </p><p> </p><p>-- SPAIN REMAINED CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN DIMENSION </p><p>OF CONFLICT.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD CONSIDER A DRAFT RESOLUTION </p><p>TO ALLEVIATE HUMANITARIAN SUFFERING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BULGARIA: IRAQI REFUSAL TO COOPERATE </p><p>EXHAUSTED POLITICAL PROCESS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) BULGARIAN PERMREP TAFROV STATED THAT THE SUSPENSION </p><p>OF INSPECTIONS SHOULD NOT CALL INTO QUESTION THE USEFULNESS </p><p>OF THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS WRIT LARGE IN THE PREVENTION OF </p><p>WMD PROLIFERATION.  HE CONTINUED: </p><p> </p><p>-- ACTIVE AND FULL COOPERATION WAS REQUIRED FOR INSPECTIONS </p><p>TO BE EFFECTIVE.  IRAQ HAD NOT COOPERATED ACTIVELY. </p><p> </p><p>-- BULGARIA REGRETTED THAT DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS DID NOT YIELD </p><p>RESULTS.  IRAQ\'S REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH INSPECTIONS HAD </p><p>CAUSED THE POLITICAL PROCESS TO BECOME EXHAUSTED, AND THE </p><p>FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1441 NOT TO BE REALIZED. </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAQ HAD FAILED TO SEIZE THE LAST CHANCE TO DISARM IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY UNSCR 1441. </p><p> </p><p>-- WHILE THE COUNCIL WAS ABLE TO REACH CONSENSUS ON THE ISSUE </p><p>OF IRAQI DISARMAMENT, IT WAS NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE SAME </p><p>UNITY ON THE METHOD OF DISARMAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- BULGARIA SUPPORTED THE SYG\'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW ALL UN </p><p>STAFF FROM IRAQ TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY. </p><p> </p><p>-- NOW THE COUNCIL SHOULD FOCUS ON THE URGENCY OF THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN IRAQ, AND SUPPORT THE CIVILIAN </p><p>POPULATION OF IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>-- BULGARIA WANTED TO PRESERVE THE ROLE OF THE UN AND THE </p><p>COUNCIL WHICH PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN PRESERVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE WORLD.  ACCORDINGLY, </p><p>THE COUNCIL SHOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE REBUILDING </p><p>OF IRAQ AFTER CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SYG ANNAN: SAD DAY FOR THE WORLD; </p><p>OCCUPYING POWER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) SYG ANNAN (FULL REMARKS IN REF B) SAID THE SESSION </p><p>MARKED "A SAD DAY FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY."  HE CONTINUED THAT "MILLIONS OF </p><p>PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SHARED THIS SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT </p><p>AND ARE DEEPLY ALARMED BY THE PROSPECT OF IMMINENT WAR."  THE </p><p>SYG COMMENDED THE WORK OF UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA, AND SAID HIS </p><p>PRIMARY CONCERN NOW WAS DEALING WITH THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>SITUATION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  THE SYG WARNED THAT, UNDER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROTECTING </p><p>CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT FALLS ON THE BELLIGERENTS. SIMILARLY, </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE POPULATION FALLS ON THE </p><p>OCCUPYING POWER.  ANNAN WARNED THAT HE HAD REQUESTED USD </p><p>123.5 MILLION FROM DONORS, BUT TO DATE HAD RECEIVED ONLY USD </p><p>45 MILLION IN PLEDGES AND OF THAT USD 34 MILLION HAS ACTUALLY </p><p>BEEN RECEIVED.  ANNAN CONCLUDED THAT THE TASK OF REBUILDING </p><p>AND REHABILITATING IRAQ COULD YET PROVE TO BE TASK AROUND </p><p>WHICH THE UNITY OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL COULD BE REBUILT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BLIX: WORK PROGRAM NOW HAS LIMITED PRACTICAL RELEVANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) UNMOVIC EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN BLIX (FULL COMMENTS REF C) </p><p>EXPRESSED RELIEF THAT ALL UNMOVIC PERSONNEL HAD BEEN SAFELY </p><p>EVACUATED TO CYPRUS.  HE TOUCHED ON THE PROGRAM OF WORK MADE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO COUNCIL MEMBERS ON MONDAY, MARCH 17, AND </p><p>"EXPRESSED SADNESS THAT THREE AND A HALF MONTHS OF WORK </p><p>CARRIED OUT IN IRAQ HAVE NOT BROUGHT THE ASSURANCES NEEDED </p><p>ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION."  BLIX </p><p>RECOGNIZED THAT THE WORK PROGRAM HAD BEEN DRAFTED FOR </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION BY A LARGE STAFF OF UNMOVIC INSPECTORS, AND </p><p>THAT IT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE LIMITED PRACTICAL RELEVANCE IN THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION.  HE ADVISED THAT UNMOVIC ROLES AND </p><p>FUNCTIONS CONTINUE UNLESS AMENDED BY A FURTHER DECISION BY </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL, AND THAT THE UNMOVIC STAFF DID </p><p>REPRESENT A UNIQUE BODY OF EXPERIENCE THAT SHOULD BE KEPT IN </p><p>MIND BY MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IAEA: READY FOR QUESTIONS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) IAEA NEW YORK REPRESENTATIVE ZLAUVINEN ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>THE IAEA WORK PROGRAM WAS READY FOR CONSIDERATION BY COUNCIL </p><p>MEMBERS (FAXED TO NP AND IO/UNP AND REF D).  HE SAID THAT </p><p>IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL EL-BARADEI WAS READY TO FIELD ANY </p><p>INQUIRIES FROM COUNCIL MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FRANCE, RUSSIA, CHINA, GERMANY, SYRIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FRANCE:  "DEMOCRACIES SHOULD SET THE EXAMPLE; </p><p>PERSUASION AS IMPORTANT AS RAW POWER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) FRENCH FM DE VILLEPIN FOCUSED HIS REMARKS ON THE NEED </p><p>FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO FOCUS ON COOPERATIVE </p><p>EFFORTS ACROSS A RANGE OF ISSUES.  VILLEPIN OFFERED A MORE </p><p>MEASURED PRESENTATION, ALBEIT ONE STILL COUCHED IN SWEEPING </p><p>TERMS, THAN HIS PAST PRESENTATIONS IN THE COUNCIL.  AS </p><p>BEFORE, APPLAUSE ERUPTED IN THE CHAMBER AT THE CONCLUSION OF </p><p>HIS INTERVENTION.  FULL TEXT OF HIS REMARKS REPORTED REF E. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MAP LAID OUT IN UNSCR 1441 WAS STILL AVAILABLE </p><p>ALTHOUGH BEING "BLOCKED" TODAY; </p><p> </p><p>-- TWO VISIONS WERE REFLECTED IN THE WORLD TODAY:  THE USE OF </p><p>FORCE TO SOLVE COMPLEX PROBLEMS VERSUS A LONG-TERM APPROACH </p><p>WHICH RECOGNIZED THAT ALL ASPECTS OF PROBLEMS NEEDED TO BE </p><p>TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, SUCH AS RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL FACTORS. </p><p> </p><p>-- DEMOCRACIES NEED TO SET THE EXAMPLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MIDDLE EAST WAS A REGION OF ANCIENT CONFLICTS AND </p><p>INSTABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAQ COULD HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR </p><p>OTHER NON-PROLIFERATION AREAS; A TOOL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>FURTHER EXPLORED.  WHY NOT A UN "DISARMAMENT CORPS" UNDER AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL UMBRELLA? </p><p> </p><p>-- THE WORLD NOW RAN THE RISK OF FAILURE, INCREASING TENSION </p><p>AND HELPING FEED TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-- NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO SOON STAUNCH THE WOUNDS OF WAR </p><p>AND FOCUS ON HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE; WE MUST PREVAIL OVER </p><p>DIFFERENCES.  FRANCE INTENDED TO BE A FULL PARTICIPANT IN </p><p>SUCH EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OIL-FOR-FOOD (OFF) PROGRAM NEEDED TO CONTINUE WITH </p><p>NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS - FRANCE LOOKED FORWARD TO RECEIVING </p><p>THE SYG,S PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>-- NO ONE STATE COULD LAY CLAIM TO BUILDING THE PEACE; THE UN </p><p>WAS THE ONLY AUTHORITY IN SUCH CASES. </p><p> </p><p>-- TWO PRINCIPLES NEEDED TO BE FOLLOWED:  TERRITORIAL </p><p>INTEGRITY OF IRAQ AND ITS SOVEREIGNTY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE WORLD FACED OTHER THREATS, SUCH AS TERRORISM AND </p><p>ORGANIZED CRIMINAL NETWORKS; STATES MUST SHOW UNITY IN SUCH </p><p>AREAS AND ON ALL FRONTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM NEEDED TO BE INTENSIFIED, </p><p>WITH NEW IMPETUS ON DEALING WITH WMD; FRANCE SUGGESTED A </p><p>MEETING OF HEADS OF STATE/GOVERNMENT ON THE SIDELINES OF THE </p><p>NEXT GENERAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THERE WERE NEW INITIATIVES ON THE MIDDLE EAST THAT </p><p>DESERVED ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN DEALING WITH THESE ASYMMETRICAL THREATS, THE ABILITY OF </p><p>COUNTRIES TO "PERSUADE WOULD BE AS IMPORTANT AS THE NUMBER OF </p><p>(MILITARY) DIVISIONS." </p><p> </p><p>-- THREE FACTORS WERE INDISPUTABLE TO A COUNTRY\'S INFLUENCE: </p><p>RESPECT FOR LAW, DEFENSE OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE AND A SHOW OF </p><p>DIALOGUE AND TOLERANCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RUSSIA:  WE REMEMBERED 9/11 AND WERE THERE </p><p>FOR YOU -- BUT NO LINKAGE WITH IRAQ </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) RUSSIAN FM IVANOV RESTATED THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>THE COUNCIL IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND NOTED THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>PUTIN HAD BEEN THE FIRST WORLD LEADER TO PHONE PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>AFTER 9/11 TRAGEDY.  STILL, THERE WAS NO PROOF THAT A LINK </p><p>BETWEEN 9/11 AND IRAQ EXISTED.  HE SAID: </p><p> </p><p>--  INSPECTORS WERE ACHIEVING TANGIBLE RESULTS; BAGHDAD HAD </p><p>VIRTUALLY FULFILLED ALL CONDITIONS/TASKS WITH FEW OBSTACLES. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PROCESS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE BASED ON AGREED </p><p>TIMELINES IN PRIOR RESOLUTIONS; UNMOVIC,S AND IAEA\'S WORK </p><p>HAD NOT CONCLUDED BUT WAS MERELY SUSPENDED. </p><p> </p><p>-- THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE OTHER THAN RETURNING THE ISSUE OF </p><p>IRAQ TO THE COUNCIL IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>SETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- NO PRIOR COUNCIL DECISIONS AUTHORIZED THE USE OF FORCE </p><p>OUTSIDE THE UN CHARTER OR APPROVED THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP OF A SOVEREIGN STATE.  SUCH ACTIONS WOULD NOT </p><p>HELP STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION/SOLIDARITY </p><p>NEEDED ON TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-- A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT NEEDED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUFFERED A HUGE </p><p>TRAGEDY; PRESIDENT PUTIN HAD BEEN THE FIRST WORLD LEADER TO </p><p>PHONE PRESIDENT BUSH AND EXTEND SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT; </p><p>SINCERE FEELINGS HAD BEEN FELT BY THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- IF WAR IN IRAQ WAS IN RESPONSE TO DIRECT THREATS TO THE </p><p>SECURITY OF THE U.S., THEN RUSSIA WOULD BE PREPARED TO </p><p>ASSEMBLE ALL MEANS TO ELIMINATE THEM.  HOWEVER, THE COUNCIL </p><p>WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO SUBSTANTIATE SUCH CLAIMS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHINA: INSPECTIONS STILL POSSIBLE? </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) IN A SLIGHTLY UNREAL INTERVENTION, CHINESE PERMREP </p><p>WANG NOTED THAT UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA HAD SUBMITTED THE WORK </p><p>PROGRAM AHEAD OF THE UNSCR 1284 SCHEDULE, AND OFFERED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- DUE TO RAPIDLY CHANGING EVENTS, THE EFFORTS OF THE COUNCIL </p><p>HAD "FALLEN BEHIND."  INSPECTIONS HAD BEEN SUSPENDED. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN LIGHT OF PROGRESS ON INSPECTIONS, IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE </p><p>TO ACHIEVE PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT.  THE INSPECTORS HAD </p><p>SUBMITTED THE WORK PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED SUGGESTIONS FOR </p><p>MORE EFFECTIVE INSPECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SITUATION IN IRAQ WAS "WORRISOME:" A SITUATION IN </p><p>WHICH WAR COULD BREAK OUT AT ANY MOMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- CHINA HAD ALWAYS PURSUED A FOREIGN POLICY OF PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>-- CHINA WAS CONCERNED FOR PEACE AND SECURITY AND THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN IRAQ, AND WAS READY "WITH THE </p><p>COUNCIL" TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE IRAQ ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE COUNCIL BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEACE AND </p><p>SECURITY AND MUST SHOULDER THAT RESPONSIBILITY IN ORDER NOT </p><p>TO "LET DOWN" THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GERMANY: "WE DO NOT LIVE ON VENUS, BUT </p><p>RATHER, WE ARE THE SURVIVORS OF MARS" </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) GERMAN FM FISCHER OFFERED A DECIDEDLY MORE EXPANSIVE </p><p>STATEMENT THAN IN PREVIOUS COUNCIL MINISTERIAL MEETINGS; THE </p><p>FULL TEXT OF HIS REMARKS IS REPORTED REF F.  HE SAID: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL COULD NOT "REMAIN SILENT" IN THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION; THE TASK AT HAND WAS TO SAFEGUARD ITS </p><p>RELEVANCE AT A TIME WHEN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAD BROUGHT THE </p><p>WORK OF THE UN TO A STANDSTILL ON THE GROUND. </p><p> </p><p>-- PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ WAS STILL POSSIBLE DESPITE </p><p>THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BY WITHHOLDING RESOLUTION DEMANDS AND </p><p>TIMELINES. </p><p> </p><p>-- TIME AND AGAIN, GERMANY HAD COLLABORATED WITH FRANCE AND </p><p>RUSSIA TO PUT FORWARD PROPOSALS FOR MORE EFFICIENT </p><p>INSPECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- REAL PROGRESS HAD BEEN ACHIEVED:  IRAQ HAD SCRAPPED MANY </p><p>OF ITS AL-SAMOUD MISSILES; 70 HAD NOW BEEN DESTROYED. </p><p> </p><p>-- THAT SAID, IRAQ,S READINESS TO COOPERATE WAS </p><p>UNSATISFACTORY; IT WAS HESITANT AND SLOW.  THE COUNCIL AGREED </p><p>ON THAT, BUT CAN THIS BE GROUNDS FOR WAR WITH ALL ITS </p><p>TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES? </p><p> </p><p>-- WHY SHOULD WE DISBAND NOW PLANS TO DISARM IRAQ VIA </p><p>PEACEFUL MEANS?  THE MAJORITY OF COUNCIL MEMBERS BELIEVED </p><p>THERE WERE NO GROUNDS FOR BREAKING OFF THE DISARMAMENT </p><p>PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THREE POINTS NEEDED TO BE EMPHASIZED:  FIRST, THE COUNCIL </p><p>HAD NOT FAILED; WE "MUST COUNTER THAT MYTH."  THE COUNCIL IS </p><p>NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING OUTSIDE THE UN. </p><p>SECOND, WE HAVE TO STATE CLEARLY THAT UNDER THE CURRENT </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES THE POLICY OF MILITARY INTERVENTION HAS NO </p><p>CREDIBILITY; IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF OUR PEOPLE; IT </p><p>WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN MUCH TO SAFEGUARD THE UNITY OF THE </p><p>COUNCIL; THERE IS NO BASIS IN THE UN CHARTER FOR REGIME </p><p>CHANGE WITH MILITARY MEANS.  THIRD, THE INSPECTION REGIME </p><p>NEEDED TO BE PRESERVED; RESOLUTIONS 1284 AND 1441 WERE STILL </p><p>IN FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UN AND COUNCIL NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO PLAY THE CENTRAL </p><p>ROLE IN THE IRAQ CONFLICT; THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE. </p><p> </p><p>-- NEGOTIATIONS ON THE IRAQ CRISIS, FOLLOWED BY MILLIONS OF </p><p>PEOPLE WORLDWIDE, REVEALED HOW RELEVANT AND INDISPENSABLE THE </p><p>PEACEMAKING ROLE OF THE COUNCIL IS. </p><p> </p><p>-- GERMANY IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT HUMANITARIAN </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF A WAR IN IRAQ - THE WORLD\'S TASK NOW IS TO DO </p><p>"EVERYTHING POSSIBLE" TO AVERT A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER. </p><p> </p><p>-- A LARGE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN GERMANY AND EUROPE ARE </p><p>GREATLY TROUBLED BY THE IMPENDING WAR; EUROPE HAD EXPERIENCED </p><p>THE HORRORS OF WAR ONLY TOO OFTEN.  THOSE WHO KNOW OUR </p><p>EUROPEAN HISTORY UNDERSTAND THAT "WE DO NOT LIVE ON VENUS </p><p>BUT, RATHER, WE ARE THE SURVIVORS OF MARS."  WAR IS TERRIBLE. </p><p> IT IS A GREAT TRAGEDY FOR THOSE AFFECTED AND FOR US ALL. </p><p> </p><p>-- NEVERTHELESS, GERMANY HAD ACCEPTED THE NECESSITY FOR WAR </p><p>ON TWO OCCASIONS DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE ALL </p><p>PEACEFUL ALTERNATIVES HAD PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL:  IN KOSOVO AND </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA: RHETORIC FLOWS, DOUBLE STANDARD </p><p>ON ISRAEL, OBJECTIVE IS CONTROL OF OIL </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) SYRIAN FM SHARA MADE A LENGTHY RHETORICAL STATEMENT, </p><p>SAYING: </p><p> </p><p>-- THIS WAS A SAD AND PAINFUL MOMENT.  NOTHING TO BE SAID </p><p>COULD ADDRESS THE VICTIMS OF WAR. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UN CHARTER OPENS:  "WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS, DETERMINED TO SAVE SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS FROM THE </p><p>SCOURGE OF WAR, WHICH TWICE IN OUR LIFETIME HAS BROUGHT </p><p>UNTOLD SORROW TO MANKIND... UNITE OUR STRENGTH TO MAINTAIN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY."  THIS WAS THE IMPORTANT </p><p>COMMITMENT CONSECRATED IN THE CHARTER 58 YEARS AGO, SIGNED IN </p><p>SAN FRANCISCO IN 1945.  A HISTORIC MONUMENT WAS BUILT TO THE </p><p>CHARTER IN NEW YORK.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO LIVE BETWEEN </p><p>THE EAST AND WEST COASTS ARE IN PLURALITY AND DIVERSITY A </p><p>MICROCOSM OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, MORE THAN ANYWHERE </p><p>ELSE IN THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE QUESTION WAS, WHETHER FOR IRAQ OR THE FORGOTTEN </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAUSE, COULD THE U.S. AND THE UK ABSOLVE </p><p>THEMSELVES OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME?  THE </p><p>UN WAS WITNESS TO HISTORY.  COULD THE U.S. USE DIFFERENCES IN </p><p>FINDING A CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTION IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL AS AN </p><p>EXCUSE TO WAGE WAR?  WHEN WAS PEACE EASY? </p><p> </p><p>-- WITHIN HOURS, A WAR OF AGGRESSION WILL BE UNLEASHED, AS </p><p>DECLARED IN WASHINGTON.  THOSE WITH VISION AND INSIGHT WILL </p><p>DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS DECISION WOULD RETURN TO HAUNT... </p><p> </p><p>-- THIS WAR WAGED TO DISARM IRAQ OF WMD WAS INCONSISTENT WITH </p><p>ISRAEL\'S STOCKPILE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MONITORING AND INSPECTIONS PROCESSES MONITORED IRAQ, THEN </p><p>SHOULD THEY NOT ALSO BE APPLIED TO ISRAEL" </p><p> </p><p>-- SYRIA VOTED "YES" FOR 1441 BECAUSE IT BELIEVED IN AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SOLUTION AND ULTIMATELY THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>INSPECTIONS PROCESS YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- TO CALL INTO QUESTION THE ROLE OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OR </p><p>THE UN OR ANY ATTEMPT TO BLAME ANY MEMBER IGNORED THAT THE </p><p>MAJORITY OF NATIONS REJECTED THE USE OF FORCE AND THERE WAS </p><p>NO NEED TO VETO A RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- UNSCR 1441\'S OP12, WHICH DEMANDED THAT THE COUNCIL BE </p><p>CONVENED, WAS IGNORED.  THIS MADE CLEAR THAT THE OBJECTIVE </p><p>WAS OCCUPATION AND EXPLOITATION OF IRAQI NATIONAL RESOURCES </p><p>IN CONTRAVENTION OF ALL INTERNATIONAL LAW. </p><p> </p><p>-- HOW COULD ONE DENY THAT IRAQ WAS COOPERATING?  ALL HAD </p><p>SEEN THE DESTRUCTION OF AL-SAMOUDS. </p><p> </p><p>-- AMERICAN RECORDS WHICH CITE DANGER TO U.S. INTERESTS AND </p><p>AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES WITH AL-QAEDA </p><p>SLEEPER CELLS ALSO INDICATE THE U.S. HAS THE BIGGEST ARSENAL </p><p>OF WMD. </p><p> </p><p>-- IF THE U.S. FORGETS THE PALESTINIANS, HOW COULD IT FORGET </p><p>RACHEL CORRIE, CRUSHED TO DEATH BY ISRAEL?  THE VIEWS OF </p><p>MILLIONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WERE CLEAR IN THE </p><p>WORLD DEMONSTRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OPTION OF PEACE WAS STILL AVAILABLE.  THE PROSPERITY </p><p>OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN PEOPLES WAS STILL AVAILABLE, AND COULD </p><p>SAVE THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF IRAQI PEOPLE IN DEFIANCE OF THE </p><p>OCCUPIER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAKISTAN: TYPICAL NUANCE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) PAKISTANI PERMREP AKRAM SHOWED NO CARDS IN HIS </p><p>INTERVENTION, NUANCING PAKISTAN\'S POSITION CAREFULLY.  WAR IS </p><p>ALWAYS A HUMAN TRAGEDY, HE QUOTED THE SYG; PAKISTAN HAD THUS </p><p>ADVOCATED A PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND EXHAUSTING ALL OTHER MEANS </p><p>BEFORE MOVING TO THE USE OF FORCE.  THE UNMOVIC / IAEA DRAFT </p><p>PROGRAM OF WORK COULD HAVE PROVIDED A USEFUL BASIS FOR THE </p><p>DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, "IF IRAQ\'S FULL, ACTIVE, AND </p><p>UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION COULD HAVE BEEN SECURED IN TIME." </p><p>IT WAS REGRETTABLE THAT "OBVIOUSLY, THE DRAFT PROGRAM OF WORK </p><p>COULD NOT BE PURSUED AT THIS TIME."  RECALLING THAT, WHILE </p><p>"THE WHOLE WORLD HAD BEEN RIVETED ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL," </p><p>MEMBERS SEPARATED BY "HONEST DIFFERENCES" HAD NOT BEEN "IN A </p><p>POSITION TO TRAVERSE THIS PATH TOGETHER;" THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL NONETHELESS REMAINED RELEVANT AND MUST UPHOLD THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD SEEK TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT ALL ITS RESOLUTIONS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE RELATED TO </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND KASHMIR, "WHERE PEOPLE HAVE </p><p>STRUGGLED AND DIED FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS," HE ADDED.  THAT </p><p>SAID, THE COUNCIL WOULD BE REORIENTED IN THE DAYS TO COME BY </p><p>URGENT HUMANITARIAN TASKS.  IN THAT CONTEXT, THE COUNCIL </p><p>SHOULD CONSIDER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE SYG\'S HUMANITARIAN </p><p>PROPOSALS WHEN RECEIVED.  PAKISTAN WOULD WORK IN SOLIDARITY </p><p>WITH ITS IRAQI "BROTHERS AND SISTERS" TO ENSURE THAT THERE </p><p>WOULD BE NO DELAY OR PROCRASTINATION TO EXACERBATE THEIR </p><p>SUFFERING.  "EVEN ONCE GUNS SPEAK," THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTAINING HUMANITARIAN SUFFERING, </p><p>ENSURING UNITY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, AND THE STABILITY </p><p>OF THE REGION AND WORLD WOULD NOT END.  THE PROCESS OF </p><p>"HEALING THE WOUNDS TO DATE AND TO COME COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED </p><p>IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THROUGH THE UN." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MEXICO: NOT TIME FOR RECRIMINATION BUT... </p><p>DEFENSIVE OF THE COUNCIL </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) IN USUAL FASHION, MEXICAN PERMREP AGUILAR-ZINSER </p><p>DEPLORED THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE JOINTLY THE </p><p>DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, BUT SAID THAT SITUATION DID NOT </p><p>CONSTITUTE AN OBSTACLE TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL\'S DISCHARGE OF </p><p>ITS RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE WORLD.  HE CONTINUED: </p><p> </p><p>-- MEXICO UPHOLDS A MULTILATERAL PATH FOR THE RESOLUTION OF </p><p>CONFLICT; PRESIDENT FOX HAD SAID THE WORLD MUST CONTINUE TO </p><p>UPHOLD THE SPIRIT AND LETTER OF THE CHARTER.  THE USE OF </p><p>FORCE WAS ONLY JUSTIFIED AS A LAST RESORT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS THE ONLY ORGAN TO WHICH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS ENTRUSTED WITH THE RIGHT TO </p><p>AUTHORIZE FORCE.  AT STAKE WAS THE VERY MANNER IN WHICH </p><p>HUMANKIND ADDRESSES QUESTIONS OF WMD AND PROLIFERATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- MEXICO WAS A DEEPLY PACIFIST AND PEACEFUL STATE.  THE </p><p>TOUCHSTONE OF THE PRINCIPLES TO WHICH MEXICO ADHERED WAS THE </p><p>PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES AND THE MULTILATERAL </p><p>APPLICATION OF POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UN WAS THE FORUM "PAR EXCELLENCE" WHICH PRESERVES OR </p><p>RESTORES PEACE, WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN OR </p><p>CHILDREN OR THE DISABLED, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE SPREAD AGAINST </p><p>DISEASE, AND WHICH HAD THE STRENGTH AND LEGITIMACY OF ITS </p><p>MANDATE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THIS CURRENT, MOST ROBUST ATTEMPT AT DISARMAMENT COULD </p><p>HAVE SUCCEEDED.  THERE WAS NO TIME FOR RECRIMINATION BUT IT </p><p>WAS TIME TO ANALYZE THE TASKS AHEAD WITH A CLEAR SENSE OF </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES AND CHALLENGES AHEAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHILE: BITTER EXAMINATION OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) CHILEAN PERMREP VALDES SAID THAT CHILE HAD EXAMINED </p><p>THE PROGRAM OF WORK WITH BITTERNESS BECAUSE "WHAT MIGHT HAVE </p><p>BEEN WAS PEACE, AND THAT WAS NOT TO BE."  CHILE HAD WISHED </p><p>FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND HAD ENDEAVORED TO IDENTIFY A PATH </p><p>TO THAT.  HE SAID: </p><p> </p><p>-- STRENGTHENED AND ACTIVE INSPECTIONS ACCOMPANIED BY ROBUST </p><p>MILITARY PRESSURE WERE CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING A PEACEFUL </p><p>SOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WERE SERIOUS FOR </p><p>HUMANITY:  THE IRAQI REGIME NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE PRICE IT </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO PAY. </p><p> </p><p>-- EACH COUNCIL MEMBER MUST SHOULDER RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>FAILING TO FIND A PATH OF COLLECTIVE ACTION, ALTHOUGH TODAY </p><p>WAS NOT A DAY FOR RECRIMINATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE INSPECTORS DESERVED TRIBUTE, AS THEY WERE ABLE TO </p><p>"EXTRACT TRUTHS AND PLACE THEM BOLDLY" BEFORE THE COUNCIL. </p><p>THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBTS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF INSPECTIONS; </p><p>CHILE BELIEVED IN THE VALUE OF THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS AS A </p><p>TOOL FOR DISARMAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- WAR WILL BRING HORROR UPON MILLIONS OF IRAQIS:  THE </p><p>COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO WORK TIRELESSLY TO SAVE LIVES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANGOLA: IRAQ DID NOT COMPLY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) ANGOLAN MINISTER MIRANDA DEPLORED THE FAILURE OF </p><p>INSPECTIONS TO HAVE DISARMED IRAQ, AND DEPLORED AS WELL THAT </p><p>IRAQ WAS UNABLE TO AVAIL ITSELF OF ITS LAST OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>COMPLY.  IRAQ DID NOT COMPLY WITH UNSCRS, IN PARTICULAR 1441, </p><p>GOVERNING ITS PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, OR ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT WAS MAKING A GENUINE </p><p>EFFORT TO DISARM.  ANGOLA DEFENDED PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS TO </p><p>CONFLICT AND BELIEVED IN THE USE OF FORCE ONLY AS THE LAST </p><p>RESORT.  FOUR DECADES OF CONFLICT IN ANGOLA HAD LED THEM TO </p><p>THE PRIMACY OF THIS BELIEF.  IN ADDITION: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENT OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- WAR IS NOW INEVITABLE; THEREFORE, THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE OF CONCERN, SINCE INNOCENTS WERE ALWAYS </p><p>MOST AFFECTED BY WAR.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD </p><p>MUSTER THE RESOURCES FOR HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO BE </p><p>DEPLOYED WHEN THE CONFLICT WAS OVER. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL, TOGETHER WITH THE BROADER UN SYSTEM, </p><p>WOULD FACE THE IMMENSE TASK OF RECONSTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAMEROON: EACH AND EVERY ONE TO BLAME </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) CAMEROONIAN PERMREP BELINGA-EBOUTOU SAID THAT THE </p><p>COUNCIL WAS AT A CROSS-ROADS, AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAD BEEN </p><p>HOPE FOR A LAST MINUTE MIRACLE, A "COLLECTIVE COMING TO OUR </p><p>SENSES" HAD NOT OCCURRED.  "WE ARE EACH AND EVERY ONE TO </p><p>BLAME; ALL WERE WRONG, AND ALL WERE RIGHT."  DISARMAMENT ON </p><p>THE PRINCIPLE OF INSPECTIONS WAS OVER.  CAMEROON PAID HOMAGE </p><p>TO THE INSPECTORS, WHO HAD JUSTIFIED THE TRUST PLACED IN </p><p>THEM.  THE COUNCIL WOULD ENTRUST TO THEM NEW TASKS IN THE </p><p>FUTURE, WHETHER IN THIS CONTEXT OR IN OTHERS.  THE DRAFT </p><p>PROGRAM OF WORK COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD BASIS.  BUT DESPITE </p><p>THE IDENTIFICATION OF KRDTS, CAMEROON DID NOT SEE HOW, ABSENT </p><p>FULL, ACTIVE AND UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION ON THE PART OF </p><p>IRAQ, THAT INSPECTIONS COULD HAVE COMPLETED THOSE TASKS.  THE </p><p>COUNCIL MUST CONSIDER THE HUMANITARIAN IMPACT OF THE DE FACTO </p><p>SUSPENSION OF THE OFF PROGRAM.  CAMEROON APPROVED THE SYG\'S </p><p>DECISION TO REMOVE UN STAFF FOR THEIR SAFETY.  BUT GIVEN THE </p><p>IMPACT ON THE IRAQI POPULATION, CAMEROON SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>661 COMMITTEE MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AT THE PERMREP LEVEL </p><p>ON THE BASIS OF THE SYG\'S PROPOSALS (NOTE: WHICH ARE STILL </p><p>FORTHCOMING.  END NOTE.).  FINALLY, CAMEROON HOPED THAT TRUST </p><p>WITHIN THE COUNCIL COULD SOON BE REVIVED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GUINEA: MORAL NECESSITY TO RID WORLD OF WMD </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) COUNCIL PRESIDENT AND GUINEAN FM FALL MADE AN </p><p>EXTREMELY BRIEF STATEMENT IN HIS NATIONAL CAPACITY.  HE SAID: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE COUNCIL HAD EXAMINED BUT COULD NOT ACHIEVE CONSENSUS </p><p>ON A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES WITH REGARD TO THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE INSPECTORS DESERVED THE THANKS OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE </p><p>PROGRAM OF WORK AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE KRDTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- GUINEA NOTED THE SYG\'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW INSPECTORS </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- WAS THERE, THEN, NO ROOM FOR HOPE?  IF ARMED CONFLICT WAS </p><p>INEVITABLE, STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO LIMIT THE MAGNITUDE OF </p><p>THE RECONSTRUCTION TASK AND TO SAFEGUARD THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>SITUATION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- GUINEA UNDERSTOOD THE MORAL NECESSITY OF RIDDING THE WORLD </p><p>OF WMD.  SUCH ACTION WAS NECESSARY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- MORE THAN EVER, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO SEE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL UNITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ:  UNREPENTANT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>26. (U) AN UNREPENTANT IRAQI PR AL-DURI (FULL REMARKS IN REF </p><p>G) THANKED COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT HAD OPPOSED THE U.S. / UK / </p><p>SPANISH DRAFT RESOLUTION AND TOOK ON THE U.S., UK, AND SPAIN </p><p>FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN THE COUNCIL.  HE SAID IRAQ HAD NO WMD </p><p>AND THE COMING DAYS WOULD PROVE IT.  AL-DURI CRITICIZED U.S. </p><p>AID PLANS FOR IRAQ, REMARKING THAT "THE EXECUTIONER CANNOT </p><p>HELP THE VICTIM EXCEPT BY KILLING HIM."  ELABORATING HE SAID </p><p>THE IRAQI PEOPLE WOULD NOT NEED HUMANITARIAN AID BUT FOR </p><p>IMMINENT U.S. / UK MILITARY ACTION.  HE REJECTED U.S. AID ON </p><p>BEHALF OF IRAQ.  HE SAID THAT THE TRUE GOALS OF THE U.S. HAD </p><p>NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SEARCH FOR WMD AND INSTEAD WERE </p><p>FOCUSED ON OCCUPYING IRAQ AND CONTROLLING ITS OIL FIELDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEGROPONTE </p><p></p></div>
