SATTERFIELD. </p><p>REASON 1.5 B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  SPECULATION OVER A FUTURE ISRAELI </p><p>WITHDRAWAL (UNILATERAL OR THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS) FROM </p><p>SOUTH LEBANON HAS GIVEN RISE TO DIFFERENCES AMONG </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S SENIOR LEADERS ABOUT THE PARTY\'S FUTURE. </p><p>THE PROSPECT OF CHANGE HAS COMPELLED THE PARTY TO </p><p>BEGIN SPECIFIC PLANNING FOR THE ROLE IT WILL PLAY IN </p><p>A POST-PEACE, POST-WITHDRAWAL LEBANON.  ITS CHOICE </p><p>IS REALLY NO CHOICE AT ALL:  WHETHER TO ACCELERATE </p><p>ITS DECADE-LONG TRANSFORMATION INTO A LEGITIMATE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY (YET ONE ALWAYS LIMITED BY ITS </p><p>SECTARIAN IDENTIFICATION) OR TO REMAIN A FRINGE </p><p>ELEMENT IN LEBANESE POLITICS (UNDER EITHER SCENARIO, </p><p>WE EXPECT EFFORTS TO INSULATE AND PROTECT HIZBALLAH </p><p>TERRORIST CELLS, FOR USE BY IRAN AND SYRIA AS </p><p>TRAINERS AND AGENTS OUTSIDE LEBANON). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE RESUMPTION OF ISRAELI-SYRIAN </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS HAS INTENSIFIED THE DEBATE WITHIN </p><p>HIZBALLAH ABOUT IDENTIFYING AND SECURING ITS FUTURE </p><p>ROLE IN LEBANON.  IN THIS UNCERTAIN ATMOSPHERE, </p><p>HIZBALLAH SECRETARY-GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH HAS </p><p>REMAINED THE LOCUS OF POWER FOR THE PARTY, AND LEADS </p><p>THE MORE PRAGMATIC, POLITICAL WING.  HIS DEPUTY, </p><p>NA\'IM QASSIM, AND MILITARY OFFICIAL MUHAMMAD YAZBAK </p><p>LEAD A MORE EXTREME WING TOUTING THE LIBERATION OF </p><p>JERUSALEM AS A NEW GOAL TO RALLY THE TROOPS, AND </p><p>RESIST ANY TYPE OF REGIONAL NORMALIZATION WITH </p><p>ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IF PRAGMATISM WINS OUT, AND THIS APPEARS </p><p>LIKELY (EVEN WITHOUT SYRIAN URGING), HIZBALLAH FACES </p><p>CHALLENGES IN BROADENING ITS BASE, FINDING A NEW </p><p>MESSAGE TO INSPIRE SUPPORT, AND TRANSFORMING ITS </p><p>PUBLIC IMAGE FROM RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS AND MILITIAMEN </p><p>TO RESPONSIVE, LEGITIMATE POLITICAL PLAYERS. </p><p>REMAINING TRUE TO ITS ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES WILL MEAN </p><p>AVOIDING NEPOTISM, CORRUPTION, AND AUTHORITARIANISM </p><p>-- TRADITIONAL FEATURES OF LEBANESE POLITICS.  CAN </p><p>HIZBALLAH DEVELOP A COHERENT, CREDIBLE AND APPEALING </p><p>MESSAGE -- ANTI-NORMALIZATION, SOCIAL GOOD DEEDS, </p><p>ADVOCACY OF THE "DISPOSSESSED" -- WHILE MANEUVERING </p><p>IN THE SNAKEPIT OF LEBANESE POLITICS?   CAN IT </p><p>RETAIN ITS POPULARITY AS IT CUTS THE DEALS WITH </p><p>LEBANESE POLITICIANS AND SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE </p><p>OFFICERS THAT GET MPS ELECTED, WITH INEVITABLE </p><p>COMPROMISES, AND  TARNISHED REPUTATIONS?  CAN ITS </p><p>OFFICERS DELIVER ON HIGH-HOPES OF REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>CHANGE SHOULD ANY ONE OF THEM GAIN A MINISTRY -- </p><p>ASSUMING THAT INCLUSION IN GOVERNMENT IS DESIRED? </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) UNTIL NOW, HIZBALLAH HAS HAD THE BEST OF TWO </p><p>WORLDS:  IT IS A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL PARTY WITH A </p><p>STRONG BLOC IN PARLIAMENT, YET IT IS ALSO AN ARMED </p><p>MILITIA WHICH GAINS ENORMOUS, CROSS-CONFESSIONAL </p><p>POPULARITY FOR FIGHTING OCCUPATION WHEN THE STATE </p><p>DID NOT.  A LONG ERA, WHICH ALLOWED THE PARTY TO </p><p>HAVE ONE FOOT IN THE SYSTEM AND ONE FOOT OUTSIDE </p><p>CHALLENGING THAT SYSTEM, IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE.  AS </p><p>IT UNDERGOES THE DEFLATING PROCESS OF MOVING FULLY </p><p>INTO LEGITIMATE POLITICS AND -- MOST IMPORTANTLY -- </p><p>A CRITICAL DECISION ON RETAINING ITS TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES, THE PARTY MAY FIND IT HAD AN EASIER TIME </p><p>FIGHTING THE IDF IN THE SOUTH.  THIS CABLE CONTINUES </p><p>OUR SERIES ON SOUTH LEBANON ON THE EVE OF CHANGE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>HIZBALLAH: UNITY IN PUBLIC, DEBATE IN PRIVATE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THROUGHOUT THE LEBANESE MEDIA\'S DAILY </p><p>SPECULATION OVER THE FUTURE PROSPECT OF AN ISRAELI </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTH LEBANON, HIZBALLAH HAS </p><p>MAINTAINED A PUBLIC POSTURE OF UNANIMITY DECLARING </p><p>THAT AN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL WILL NOT FUNDAMENTALLY </p><p>CHANGE THE MOVEMENT\'S STRATEGY AND TACTICS. </p><p>HOWEVER, CONVERSATIONS WITH SEVERAL LEBANESE </p><p>OFFICIALS AND ACADEMICS TELL A DIFFERENT STORY.  THE </p><p>SENIOR LEADERSHIP OF HIZBALLAH (PRIMARILY THE SHURA </p><p>COUNCIL, THE POLITICAL WING, THE MILITARY WING), HAS </p><p>BEEN ENGAGED IN A "VIGOROUS DEBATE," IN THE WORDS OF </p><p>ONE AUB POLITICAL SCIENTIST, OVER HOW TO RESPOND TO </p><p>AN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL.  THE STRATEGIC DEBATE HAS </p><p>FOCUSED ON HOW BEST TO REMAIN A VIABLE AND EFFECTIVE </p><p>PART OF THE LEBANESE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN THE </p><p>SOUTH, AS WELL AS KEY CONSTITUENCIES IN BEIRUT, </p><p>SHOULD THE ACTIVE MILITARY RESISTANCE END. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE RESUMPTION OF THE ISRAEL-SYRIA TRACK OF </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS IS LIKELY TO INTENSIFY </p><p>THE DEBATE WITHIN HIZBALLAH\'S SENIOR LEADERSHIP </p><p>ABOUT ITS FUTURE ROLE IN LEBANON.  IN THIS DEBATE, </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH CONTINUES TO </p><p>MAINTAIN HIS DOMINANCE AS THE DE JURE AND DE FACTO </p><p>HEAD OF THE PARTY.  HOWEVER, TWO CAMPS HAVE EMERGED </p><p>OVER HOW TO DEAL WITH THE WITHDRAWAL.  NASRALLAH AND </p><p>THE HIZBALLAH MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT REPRESENT WHAT </p><p>HAS BEEN TERMED THE "PRAGMATIC" WING OF THE PARTY </p><p>THAT WISHES TO DEVOTE MORE RESOURCES TO HIZBALLAH\'S </p><p>POLITICAL AND SOCIAL AGENDA IN BEIRUT, THE BIQA\', </p><p>AND THE SOUTH ONCE THE IDF/SLA VACATE THEIR </p><p>POSITIONS.  LEBANESE OBSERVERS DOUBT THAT NASRALLAH </p><p>WISHES TO DISMANTLE THE MILITARY WING OF HIZBALLAH, </p><p>BUT HE REALIZES HE MAY HAVE LITTLE CHOICE IF THERE </p><p>IS A PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) A MORE EXTREMIST WING IS LED BY DEPUTY SECGEN </p><p>NA\'IM QASSIM AND MILITARY COMMANDER MUHAMMAD YAZBAK. </p><p>THIS WING WISHES TO MAINTAIN A HARD-LINE AGAINST THE </p><p>ISRAELIS BY TRUMPETING THE ISSUE OF JERUSALEM AS ITS </p><p>"CAUSE CELEBRE," AND AGITATING AGAINST ANY TYPE OF </p><p>NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL SHOULD A FUTURE PEACE </p><p>TREATY BE SIGNED.  THIS WAS EVIDENCED BY QASSIM\'S </p><p>NOVEMBER REMARKS TO HIZBALLAH SUPPORTERS IN </p><p>BA\'ALBACK-HERMEL.  IN CONTRAST TO NASRALLAH\'S PARTY </p><p>MAINSTREAM, THIS WING CONTINUES TO ENOUNCE THE GOALS </p><p>OF THE 1979 IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND ITS EXPORT TO </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES -- ESPECIALLY LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) HIZBALLAH\'S SPIRITUAL LEADER, MUHAMMAD HUSAYN </p><p>FADLALLAH, REPRESENTS ANOTHER LEADERSHIP AXIS.  HIS </p><p>AGENDA LIES IN HIS ASPIRATION TO BE REGARDED AS THE </p><p>"MARJA\'IYYA" (SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY) OF THE SHI\'A OF </p><p>LEBANON (AND IDEALLY, THE WORLD).  FADLALLAH AND </p><p>NASRALLAH ARE OFTEN AT ODDS, AND FADLALLAH HAS OVER </p><p>THE YEARS DRIFTED AWAY FROM ANY DIRECT INVOLVEMENT </p><p>WITH THE PARTY -- YET RETAINS CONSIDERABLE MORAL </p><p>AUTHORITY OVER ITS RANK-AND-FILE, AND THUS CANNOT BE </p><p>IGNORED BY ITS LEADERSHIP.  HOWEVER, HE TOO MUST BE </p><p>MINDFUL OF DIVISIONS WITHIN THE PARTY; HIS OWN </p><p>AMBITION TO BE REGARDED AS A SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY </p><p>REQUIRES THAT HE NOT TAKE SIDES BETWEEN PRAGMATISTS </p><p>AND HARD-LINERS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE PRAGMATIC/HARD-LINE RIFT BECAME PUBLIC </p><p>KNOWLEDGE WITH FORMER SECRETARY GENERAL SUBHI </p><p>TUFAYLI\'S "REVOLT OF THE HUNGRY" DURING 1996-1997. </p><p>TUFAYLI\'S REVOLT WAS A FORK IN THE ROAD FOR </p><p>HIZBALLAH OVER ITS FUTURE ACTIVITIES.  TUFAYLI\'S </p><p>SCHOOL OF THOUGHT ARGUED FOR MORE MILITANT </p><p>ENGAGEMENT IN LEBANESE AND REGIONAL POLITICS -- </p><p>PRIMARILY INCREASED RESISTANCE ATTACKS IN THE SOUTH </p><p>-- WHILE THE OTHER SCHOOL ENCOURAGED GREATER </p><p>EMPHASIS ON HIZBALLAH SOCIAL AND CHARITABLE </p><p>PROGRAMS, AND MORE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>LEBANESE POLITICAL SYSTEM.  QASSIM AND YAZBAK ARE </p><p>THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MORE SYMPATHETIC TO TUFAYLI\'S </p><p>OVERALL STAND REGARDING A MORE MILITANT POLITICAL </p><p>AND MILITARY AGENDA, BUT WERE AWARE THAT OPENLY </p><p>SIDING WITH THE FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL MEANT </p><p>POLITICAL SUICIDE.  THE SQUELCHING OF TUFAYLI\'S </p><p>REVOLT WITH SYRIAN SUPPORT IS EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S EXTREME FACTIONS DID NOT, AND WILL NOT </p><p>PREVAIL. </p><p> </p><p>HIZBALLAH CONSIDERING FUTURE SCENARIOS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) MUCH OF THE TACTICAL DISCUSSION OF THE </p><p>FUTURE CENTERS ON THE TYPE OF WITHDRAWAL THE IDF </p><p>WILL IMPLEMENT, HOW TO RESPOND TO IT, AND HOW TO </p><p>MANEUVER IF A SYRIA-ISRAEL PEACE TREATY IS </p><p>CONCLUDED.  THE ACTIVE MILITARY RESISTANCE HAS BEEN </p><p>ONE OF THE KEY PILLARS OF HIZBALLAH\'S LEGITIMACY AND </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS THROUGHOUT LEBANON AND REMOVING IT IS </p><p>LIKELY TO SAP PARTY STRENGTH.  AS A RESULT, </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERS HAVE BEEN PONDERING WHAT SOUTH </p><p>LEBANON WILL LOOK LIKE WITH AN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL </p><p>COUPLED WITH OVERT, OR COVERT, SYRIAN SECURITY </p><p>GUARANTEES.  STUDY GROUPS HAVE BEEN FORMED TO </p><p>DISCUSS FUTURE POSSIBILITIES.  IN PUBLIC, HASSAN </p><p>NASRALLAH REMAINS SILENT OVER HOW HIZBALLAH WILL </p><p>REACT TO A WITHDRAWAL, OR A FUTURE PEACE TREATY </p><p>BETWEEN SYRIA AND ISRAEL.  HIZBALLAH\'S REACTION TO </p><p>THE RECENT SLA SHELLING OF A SCHOOL IN ARAB SALIM </p><p>(REF A) MAY BE TELLING OF THE FINE LINE THAT </p><p>HIZBALLAH WALKS IN LEBANESE POLITICS.  NASRALLAH WAS </p><p>QUOTED ON NOVEMBER 17 AS SAYING THAT THE ATTACK </p><p>"DESERVES RETALIATION BY THE RESISTANCE ON </p><p>SETTLEMENTS IN NORTHERN PALESTINE...HOWEVER, FOR NOW </p><p>WE WILL JUST SEND A CLEAR AND FIRM WARNING TO THE </p><p>ENEMY."  THIS IS BUT THE LATEST EPISODE TO SHOW THAT </p><p>THE MILITIA IS ON A TIGHT SYRIAN LEASH, AND WILL LAY </p><p>DOWN ITS ARMS WHEN DOING SO SERVES SYRIAN INTERESTS. </p><p>THE PARTY THEN FACES THE OBVIOUS CHALLENGE, BEGUN </p><p>NINE YEARS AGO WHEN IT ENTERED PARLIAMENT, OF </p><p>TRANSFORMING ITSELF INTO A LEGITIMATE AND APPEALING </p><p>POLITICAL PLAYER, BUT WITHOUT THE UNIFYING FORCE OF </p><p>ACTIVE RESISTANCE.  YET ENTERING THE FRAY MORE FULLY </p><p>MEANS DEALING WITH THE SMALL COMPROMISES AND </p><p>CONDITIONS WHICH MAKE LEBANESE POLITICS SUCH AN </p><p>UNDIGNIFIED SPORT. </p><p> </p><p>CONTINUING THE POLITICAL COMPETITION WITH AMAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) LIKE ALL OTHER POLITICAL FACTIONS HERE, </p><p>HIZBALLAH IS PREPARING FOR THE Y2000 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  NABIH BERRI\'S AMAL MOVEMENT HAS CAPTURED </p><p>THE SUPPORT OF MANY OF THE TRADITIONAL FAMILIES OF </p><p>SOUTH LEBANON INCLUDING THE \'USAYRANS AND BAYDOUNS </p><p>OF SIDON AND TYRE RESPECTIVELY.  THESE FAMILIES HAVE </p><p>STRONG TIES TO BEIRUT\'S RULING CLASS AND SYRIAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP CIRCLES, AND SURPRISING RESILIENCE IN THE </p><p>SOUTH AS DELIVERERS OF LARGE BLOCS OF WHOLESALE </p><p>VOTES.  ONE OPTION FOR HIZBALLAH IS TO COURT THE </p><p>NEWEST EMERGING ECONOMIC GROUP IN THE SOUTH -- THOSE </p><p>POORER LEBANESE WHO LEFT THE SOUTH AFTER 1978 AND </p><p>MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN ABIDJAN, CONAKRY, AND </p><p>DETROIT.  SOME OF THESE FAMILIES HAVE RETURNED HOME, </p><p>OR AT LEAST BUILT PALATIAL SUMMER VILLAS TO LET </p><p>PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE MADE IT.  MANY OF THESE </p><p>CITIZENS PUT CASH INTO AMAL\'S COFFERS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HIZBALLAH COULD WOO THIS CLASS -- ALREADY TAPPED FOR </p><p>PARTY CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE ORPHANS </p><p>AND MARTYRS FUNDS -- TO HELP SUSTAIN A POLITICAL </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE SOUTH.  THEY COULD BECOME AN </p><p>IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE SHOULD IRANIAN </p><p>FINANCIAL RESOURCES DRY UP. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) HIZBALLAH WILL HAVE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES IN </p><p>COMPETING WITH AMAL.  WHILE NABIH BERRI HAS KEPT </p><p>MANY OF THE LARGE, TRADITIONAL FAMILIES OF THE SOUTH </p><p>IN HIS POCKET, MOST OF THAT SUPPORT IS BASED ON </p><p>BERRI\'S PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH FAMILY HEADS, </p><p>BERRI\'S "CULT OF PERSONALITY," AND FEAR OF BERRI\'S </p><p>WRATH.  HOWEVER, THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IS SYRIAN </p><p>ELECTORAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.  THEY USUALLY </p><p>ENCOURAGE FORMATION OF PRE-COOKED "GRAND ALLIANCES" </p><p>AMONG ALL MAJOR, ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL FACTORS, </p><p>HOWEVER UNNATURAL SUCH AN ALLIANCE MAY BE.  THUS THE </p><p>WINNING SOUTHERN TICKET FOR Y2000 ELECTIONS </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY WILL INCLUDE A PRE-DETERMINED NUMBER OF </p><p>CANDIDATES FROM BOTH AMAL AND HIZBALLAH, WITH A </p><p>SPRINKLING OF TRADITIONAL FAMILY ELDERS, WHO CAN </p><p>DELIVER VOTES AND MONEY. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) HIZBALLAH HAS TRUE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, THE BIQA\', AND IN THE SOUTHERN </p><p>SUBURBS.  BUT THE NUMBER OF SEATS IT WILL GAIN IN </p><p>THE HOUSE WILL BE A PRODUCT OF THE PRE-BALLOT, BACK </p><p>ROOM NEGOTIATIONS WITH BERRI AND SYRIAN MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CHIEF FOR LEBANON, GHAZI KANAAN OVER </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF SEATS IN THE "GRAND ALLIANCE." </p><p>KANAAN IS EXPECTED TO RECOGNIZE THAT HIZBALLAH WILL </p><p>HAVE EARNED A FEW ADDITIONAL SEATS THIS YEAR (THREE, </p><p>SAYS CURRENT SPECULATION:  TWO IN THE BIQA\' AND ONE </p><p>IN THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS).  COMBINED WITH ANTICIPATED </p><p>EFFORTS BY PRESIDENT LAHOUD TO CUT BERRI (A MAJOR </p><p>OBSTACLE TO REFORMS) DOWN A NOTCH, Y2000 MAY BE A </p><p>GOOD ELECTORAL YEAR FOR HIZBALLAH.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>RESULTS WILL HAVE ONLY A NOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH </p><p>THE PARTY\'S VOTE-GATHERING CAPACITY.  THEY WILL ALSO </p><p>BE A HARBINGER OF THE COMPROMISES AND </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENTS, WHICH THE PARTY WILL FEEL AS IT </p><p>MORE FULLY ENGAGES ITS ENERGIES IN THE LEBANESE </p><p>POLITICAL FRAY.  (NOTABLY, OUR AMAL CONTACTS </p><p>INDICATE AN EXPECTATION THAT IF A PEACE WITH ISRAEL </p><p>PRECEDES ELECTIONS, DAMASCUS WILL HAVE LESS NEED FOR </p><p>HIZBALLAH, AND BE MORE INTERESTED IN PROMOTING </p><p>BERRI, GIVEN HIS GREATER UTILITY TO SYRIA IN </p><p>LEBANESE DOMESTIC POLITICS.) </p><p> </p><p>A CABINET SEAT TO SWEETEN TRANSITION? </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) HIZBALLAH\'S RELATIONS WITH THE GOL HAVE </p><p>FURTHER FUELED DEBATE WITHIN ITS SENIOR LEADERSHIP </p><p>ABOUT THE FUTURE.  HIZBALLAH FIRST BEGAN ITS LONG- </p><p>TERM INVESTMENT IN LEGITIMACY WHEN IT ENTERED </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, AND PARLIAMENT, IN 1992. </p><p>THEY HAVE, HOWEVER, NOT BEEN OFFERED A CABINET SEAT </p><p>-- IN PART BECAUSE OF RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF THE </p><p>HARIRI AND HOSS GOVERNMENTS TO BRING THEM IN AND IN </p><p>PART DUE TO STRONGLY EXPRESSED U.S. OPPOSITION. </p><p>PRESIDENT LAHOUD HAS COURTED THE PARTY (IN PART TO </p><p>ANNOY NABIH BERRI, IN PART BECAUSE IT SEEMS POPULAR, </p><p>AND IN PART BECAUSE HE THINKS IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER </p><p>FOR HIM TO MANAGE THE PARTY LATER).  MUCH OF </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL AGENDA PARALLELS </p><p>LAHOUD\'S -- ANTI-CORRUPTION, ADDRESSING SOCIAL </p><p>PROBLEMS, AND CREATING VIABLE STATE INSTITUTIONS. </p><p>IN APRIL, LAHOUD SPOKE AT "THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE </p><p>TO SUPPORT THE RESISTANCE" EMPHASIZING THAT THE </p><p>RESISTANCE IS NOT LIMITED TO A SINGLE PARTY, BUT IS </p><p>PART OF A MUCH LARGER NATIONAL MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) THIS ONGOING DANCE WILL RAISE EXPECTATIONS </p><p>THAT THE PARTY WILL BE OFFERED A CABINET SEAT, TO </p><p>RECOGNIZE ITS ROLE IN LIBERATING THE SOUTH AND AS A </p><p>SWEETENER AS THE MILITIA DISARMS (THIS WAS THE </p><p>TACTIC USED IN 1991 WITH MOST OTHER LEBANESE </p><p>MILITIAS, AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR).  BUT IT IS </p><p>NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER NASRALLAH IS PREPARED TO TAKE </p><p>THE PLUNGE OF ENTERING THE CABINET -- THEREBY ENDING </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S ABILITY TO DISASSOCIATE ITSELF FROM </p><p>GOVERNMENT ACTIONS IT MAY NOT APPROVE.  IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT, HIZBALLAH WOULD FACE AN INEVITABLE </p><p>PROCESS OF COOPTION.  IT WOULD BE DIRECTLY </p><p>CHALLENGED TO PROVE THAT IT CAN DELIVER ON ITS </p><p>PROMISES FOR SOCIAL WELFARE AND CHANGE, YET WOULD </p><p>HAVE LITTLE REAL AUTHORITY, GIVEN THE CONSTRAINED </p><p>NATURE OF LEBANON\'S CABINET SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) WITH RESISTANCE GONE, HIZBALLAH WILL HAVE TO </p><p>ADAPT TO A DIFFERENT POLITICAL-MILITARY SITUATION IN </p><p>THE SOUTH, AS WELL AS BEIRUT.  HIZBALLAH WILL DEVOTE </p><p>MORE RESOURCES TO ITS POLITICAL WING (A TREND </p><p>ALREADY UNDERWAY).  IT HAS DROPPED -- BUT NOT </p><p>REPUDIATED -- ITS CALL FOR AN ISLAMIC REPUBLIC (A </p><p>NON-STARTER IN A LAND OF MINORITIES).  HIZBALLAH HAS </p><p>REACHED OUT TO CHRISTIAN PARTIES AND THE MARONITE </p><p>PATRIARCH TO PROMOTE ISSUES OF COMMON CONCERN LIKE </p><p>ANTI-CORRUPTION AND TAX REFORM, AND POLITICAL </p><p>DIALOGUE.  THIS PROCESS OF "DE-DEMONIZATION" OF THE </p><p>PARTY AMONG CHRISTIANS IS WORKING, IF THE </p><p>INFATUATION OF MANY OF THE MARONITE PATRIARCH\'S </p><p>ADVISOR WITH THE DIALOGUE IS ANY GUIDE. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) BUT WHAT WILL BE THE NEW MAINSPRING FOR THE </p><p>PARTY?  ABSENT THE UNITING FORCE OF MILITARY </p><p>RESISTANCE OR OF A CREDIBLE AGENDA FOR ISLAMIC </p><p>CHANGE IN THIS PLURALISTIC SOCIETY, WHAT WILL BE </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S MESSAGE?  UNDOUBTEDLY, IT WILL FOCUS ON </p><p>OPPOSING NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL, ON ANTI- </p><p>CORRUPTION AND FAMILY VALUES, AND ON ADVOCACY OF THE </p><p>POOR AND DISPOSSESSED SHI\'A OF THE SOUTH, BIQA\', AND </p><p>BEIRUT\'S SOUTHERN SUBURBS (THE ORIGINAL PLATFORM </p><p>INSPIRING FORMATION OF AMAL MOVEMENT).  HIZBALLAH </p><p>CAN MORE CREDIBLY PROMOTE THESE OBJECTIVES THAN ANY </p><p>OTHER PARTY IN LEBANON.  HOWEVER, THE SECTARIAN </p><p>NATURE OF LEBANESE POLITICS, REFEREED BY SYRIA, </p><p>MEANS ANY SHI\'A PARTY WILL HAVE ONLY ON A NARROW </p><p>PIECE OF THE PLAYING FIELD.  UNDER THIS CONDITION, </p><p>IT CANNOT ASPIRE TO NATIONAL LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>COMING TO TERMS WITH CHANGE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) HIZBALLAH IS NOT LIKELY TO FADE ONCE ISRAEL </p><p>WITHDRAWS, BUT IT WILL FACE THE SAME TYPES OF </p><p>CHALLENGES THAT OTHER LEBANESE POLITICAL ENTITIES </p><p>FACE, AND THE IN-BUILT INHIBITING FACTOR OF </p><p>REPRESENTING ONLY ONE RELIGIOUS SECT AMONG 17 IN </p><p>LEBANON.  CHALLENGES INCLUDE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL </p><p>RIVALRIES WITHIN THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY AND SYRIAN </p><p>DOMINATION OF LEBANESE POLITICS.  BROADENING ITS </p><p>BASE OF POLITICAL SUPPORT AND TRANSFORMING ITS </p><p>PUBLIC IMAGE FROM RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS AND MILITIAMEN </p><p>TO RESPONSIVE, LEGITIMATE POLITICAL PLAYERS WILL </p><p>REMAIN THE PARTY\'S KEY CHALLENGES FOLLOWING AN </p><p>ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL.  OTHER ISLAMIC PARTIES IN THE </p><p>REGION HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS TRANSFORMATION FROM </p><p>EXTREMISM TO THE MAINSTREAM, IN EGYPT, JORDAN, AND </p><p>TURKEY.  REMAINING TRUE TO ITS ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES </p><p>WILL MEAN AVOIDING THE NEPOTISM, CORRUPTION, AND </p><p>AUTHORITARIANISM OF TRADITIONAL LEBANESE POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES.  HIZBALLAH WILL HAVE TO MANEUVER MORE </p><p>ACTIVELY IN THE SNAKE PIT OF LEBANESE POLITICS, AND </p><p>MAY WELL FIND IT HAD AN EASIER TIME FIGHTING THE IDF </p><p>IN THE SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) THIS PROCESS IS LIKELY TO CREATE A PARTY </p><p>THAT FINDS ITS SELF-INTEREST REQUIRES MODERATION, </p><p>NOT EXTREMISM, AND INSULATION FROM PARTY TERRORIST </p><p>CELLS AND TERRORIST ASSOCIATIONS WHICH IRAN AND THE </p><p>HIZBALLAH LEADERSHIP ITSELF MAY SEEK TO PRESERVE IN </p><p>LEBANON TO ADVANCE AIMS ABROAD.  SHOULD HIZBALLAH </p><p>FIND A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. -- OR SIMPLY OUR </p><p>RECOGNITION AS A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL/SOCIAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION -- IN ITS INTERESTS (AT PRESENT, ALL </p><p>INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE GROUP HAS NO INTEREST IN </p><p>CONTACT WITH THE USG, EVEN IF WE WERE WILLING), IT </p><p>WILL HAVE TO ABANDON ALL INVOLVEMENT WITH TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES HERE AND ELSEWHERE, ON ITS OWN PART AND </p><p>THROUGH ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) AS WITH IRAN ITSELF, HIZBALLAH WILL SEEK TO </p><p>MAINTAIN ITS DUALITY OF CONDUCT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. </p><p>AND AS WITH IRAN, WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE </p><p>CLEAR TO ALL CONCERNED -- INCLUDING THE GOL -- THAT </p><p>THE U.S. WILL NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN AN </p><p>"ACCEPTABLE" HIZBALLAH AND THE HIZBALLAH WHICH IS </p><p>INVOLVED IN TERROR.  IN THIS REGARD, WE ARE </p><p>CONCERNED AT GROWING EVIDENCE THAT HIZBALLAH\'S </p><p>INVOLVEMENT -- IN COORDINATION WITH IRAN -- WITH </p><p>GROUPS SUCH AS HAMAS AND THE PALESTINE ISLAMIC JIHAD </p><p>IS INCREASING, NOT DIMINISHING AS A RESOLUTION OF </p><p>SOUTH LEBANON AND AN END TO THE LEBANESE RESISTANCE </p><p>RAISON D\'ETRE APPROACHES. </p><p> </p><p>SATTERFIELD </p><p></p></div>
