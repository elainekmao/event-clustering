<p>S E C R E T OTTAWA 000703 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NP/RA, NP/MNA, NEA/AGT, EAP/K, WHA/CAN AND IO/T </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KNNP, PARM, KN, IR, CA, NPT </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA ON NORTH KOREAN AND IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 61830 (B) STATE 65141 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Mary Witt, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Canada shares our strong concerns about the North </p><p>Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, and believes that Iran </p><p>will be emboldened if North Korea abandons the Nuclear </p><p>Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  We discussed reftel messages </p><p>with Marc Vidricaire, Director of the Nuclear and Chemical </p><p>Disarmament Implementation Agency (IDN); Ron Stansfield, IDN </p><p>Senior Policy Advisor; and Joanne Khouryati, North Korea Desk </p><p>Officer.  In the case of North Korea, Foreign Minister Graham </p><p>issued a statement in January deploring the DPRK\'s intention </p><p>to withdraw from the NPT, and reaffirming the central </p><p>importance of the NPT.  Canada has expressed its concerns to </p><p>North Korea privately through its missions in Beijing and at </p><p>the UN, but has little leverage on its own.  Aside from </p><p>continued humanitarian food aid, Canada-North Korea relations </p><p>are at a standstill.  North Korean officials were searching </p><p>for an Embassy site in Ottawa, but the GoC asked them not to </p><p>return when they left in December. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Canada prefers to try to pressure North Korea through </p><p>multilateral institutions, but is not encouraged with how </p><p>that is proceeding.  Vidricaire commented that if the UN </p><p>Security Council is not prepared to take credible action - </p><p>and he expects Russia and China to oppose such action - then </p><p>the DPRK will get the wrong message.  The DPRK will still be </p><p>a major focus of the NPT PrepCom in April, but inaction by </p><p>the UNSC will confuse the issue.  Given the importance of </p><p>turning the DPRK around, Vidricaire urged us to consider some </p><p>compromise formula whereby the U.S. and North Korea would </p><p>meet bilaterally on the margins of a multilateral meeting. </p><p>(NOTE: Canada\'s Assistant Deputy Minister for Asia-Pacific, </p><p>David Mulroney, will be in Washington on March 20 and has </p><p>requested a meeting with EAP A/S Kelly.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) On Iran, Canada plans to express concern in its </p><p>statement to the IAEA Board of Governors meeting next week, </p><p>and to follow that up with a demarche on IAEA DG El-Baradei. </p><p>Vidricaire cautioned that El-Baradei has limited personal </p><p>influence on how the IAEA proceeds, as he is beholden to the </p><p>wishes of member states. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Now that Iran is being closely watched, Vidricaire was </p><p>concerned that it might choose to follow the letter of the </p><p>law in development of a full-blown civil nuclear program, and </p><p>then be able to convert it to a weapons program on short </p><p>notice at a later date.  Like North Korea, Iran might choose </p><p>a time of crisis, when the U.S. and the international </p><p>community are distracted, to leave the NPT.  Unlike North </p><p>Korea, Iran would then have a large-scale nuclear program, </p><p>and would present a much greater threat.  Vidricaire said the </p><p>IAEA would find it difficult to curb the Iranian program if </p><p>it proceeded in this manner.  He felt that Iran also saw </p><p>India and Pakistan as role models - defying the NPT, bearing </p><p>up under international censure for a number of years, and </p><p>emerging at the other end with nuclear weapons. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
