<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 000861 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EPET, MARR, IZ, EAID, SA, KU, JO, UA </p><p>SUBJECT: SAUDIS TELL KING ABDULLAH THEY WILL JOIN OIL DEAL; </p><p>JORDAN WILL ASK FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR IRAQ HUMANITARIAN </p><p>RELIEF COSTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>CP ABDULLAH MAKES FUZZY COMMITMENT TO SUPPLY OIL TO JORDAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  King Abdullah told the Ambassador and PolCouns </p><p>February 5 that Saudi CP Abdullah confirmed to him during his </p><p>February 4 visit to Saudi Arabia that the Saudis are prepared </p><p>to provide Jordan with oil in the event of a cutoff in </p><p>supplies from Iraq.  The King said the oil would come through </p><p>Yanbo, and that the Saudis were "seeking an increased </p><p>commitment from Kuwait and the UAE" on the oil deal.  CP </p><p>Abdullah told the King he wants to see "50 - 50, plus 50 from </p><p>Saudi Arabia" (presumably meaning provision of 50,000 bpd to </p><p>Jordan from each of the three countries).  The King </p><p>commented, however, that there was "no practical conversation </p><p>about the details" of the possible oil deliveries on either </p><p>price or specific delivery mechanism.  In a separate </p><p>conversation February 6, Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb told </p><p>the Ambassador that Saudi Oil Minister Naimi told him that </p><p>Jordan could send a ship to Yanbo and get Saudi oil "on 24 </p><p>hours notice."  Abul Ragheb understood from the Saudis that </p><p>such an arrangement would last for three months "assuming </p><p>that oil shipments from Iraq will come back."  "I know that I </p><p>am now getting my oil," he concluded. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  In a separate conversation with Ambassador and </p><p>PolCouns February 5, Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher repeated </p><p>the substance of the King\'s remarks.  Based on the </p><p>Jordanians\' conversations with the CP, Muasher said, "things </p><p>seem to be going well" with the Saudis on oil.  "The Crown </p><p>Prince told us \'we will cover your needs,\' but no one has yet </p><p>given us the terms.  We think they will be favorable, but we </p><p>don\'t know the final quantities or the price."  He noted that </p><p>Jordanian Energy Minister Mohammad Bataineh had recently met </p><p>with the Saudi, UAE, and Kuwaiti oil ministers in Abu Dhabi, </p><p>"and the UAE Minister didn\'t even know about the deal." </p><p>Muasher said he had called UAE MinState for Foreign Affairs </p><p>Prince Hamdan later to confirm that the deal was still on the </p><p>table, and Hamdan said he would make sure his oil minister </p><p>was brought into the loop. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  PM Abul Ragheb said that he was also looking at the </p><p>possibility that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (or Saudi Arabia </p><p>alone) could supply all of Jordan\'s oil needs, and that the </p><p>UAE (or the UAE and Kuwait) would make a monetary </p><p>contribution in lieu of actual petroleum.  Abul Ragheb said </p><p>he would go to Abu Dhabi and Kuwait after the Eid to try to </p><p>work out details of such an arrangement (although he also </p><p>said during another part of the conversation that GID </p><p>Director Saad Kheir was in charge of this deal). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>IRAQ RELIEF EFFORTS:  "WE NEED TO GET BACK EVERY PENNY" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Ambassador and PolCouns briefed the King and Muasher </p><p>on the visit of the PRM/OFDA Humanitarian Planning Team, </p><p>emphasizing the team\'s desire to work out mechanisms to </p><p>increase coordination between the Jordanian Armed Forces </p><p>(JAF), the U.S. military, UN agencies, and NGOs in the event </p><p>of war.  Muasher and the King welcomed the news of a USD 15m </p><p>grant to UN agencies and hoped this would permit UNHCR to </p><p>reimburse some of the GOJ\'s costs associated with possible </p><p>flows of refugees and/or third country nationals into and </p><p>through Jordan.  Noting that Jordan got almost no </p><p>international assistance to cover its refugee/TCN costs </p><p>during the 1990-91 Gulf War, Muasher quipped "We need to get </p><p>back every penny we spend.  If UNHCR can pay, fine.  If they </p><p>don\'t pay, we will ask you (the USG)." </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
