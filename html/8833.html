<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 002763 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NP AND EUR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, PARM, PREL, IT, LY, EU, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: LIBYAN REFERENCE IN US-EU PROLIFERATION STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 171136 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING POL MC JOHN BASS, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS AN ACTION REQUEST FOR NP.  PLEASE </p><p>    SEE PARA 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT BELIEVES QADAFFI HAS "CHOSEN </p><p>THE PATH OF REINTEGRATION" INTO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>AND WAS TAKING IMPORTANT STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION, THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, GIANPAOLO SCARANTE, </p><p>TOLD US JUNE 18.  ITALY WAS NOT OPPOSED IN PRINCIPLE TO </p><p>INCLUDING A REFERENCE TO LIBYA IN A US-EU PROLIFERATION </p><p>STATEMENT; EXPERTS COULD WORK OUT THE DETAILS IN NORMAL </p><p>CHANNELS.  SCARANTE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT QADAFFI\'S WMD AND </p><p>MISSILE ACQUISITION PROGRAMS HAD NOT BEEN DISMANTLED ("OTHER </p><p>PATHS STILL EXIST") BUT SAID HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC </p><p>INFORMATION ON THEIR CONTINUED ACTIVITIES.  SCARANTE MIRRORED </p><p>WASHINGTON DCM STEFANINI\'S REFTEL COMMENTS IN ENCOURAGING THE </p><p>U.S. TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION.  HE REITERATED THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S ASSESSMENT, BASED ON HIS DIRECT CONTACTS, </p><p>THAT QADAFFI IS COMMITTED TO LIBYA\'S REINTEGRATION AND </p><p>WORKING TOWARD THAT GOAL. </p><p> </p><p>3. WE ALSO PROVIDED THE POINTS TO MFA LIBYA OFFICE DIRECTOR </p><p>BELLAVIA AND NONPROLIFERATION EXPERT SARDI, NEITHER OF WHOM </p><p>HAD IMMEDIATE COMMENTS THAT WENT BEYOND BELLAVIA\'S JUNE 16 </p><p>COMMENTS (REF B) THAT A HARD PUSH ON NONPRO NOW WOULD REDUCE </p><p>THE LIKELIHOOD OF QADAFFI ABANDONING LIBYA\'S UNSC BID. </p><p> </p><p>4. COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST: WE THINK SCARANTE\'S COMMENTS, </p><p>TOGETHER WITH STEFANINI\'S, REFLECT AN ITALIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>CALCULATION THAT THWARTING LIBYA\'S UNSC MEMBERSHIP BID IS THE </p><p>USG\'S MAIN PRIORITY ON LIBYA.  HIS SUGGESTION THAT ITALY IS </p><p>NOT OPPOSED IN PRINCIPLE TO A LIBYA REFERENCE IN THE NONPRO </p><p>STATEMENT IS PROBABLY MORE A BAIT-AND-SWITCH BACK TO THE MFA </p><p>    THAN IT IS A REAL OPENING.  THE ITALIANS WON\'T PUSH FOR A </p><p>REFERENCE TO LIBYA, BUT WE DON\'T THINK THEY WILL WANT TO BE </p><p>ISOLATED WITHIN THE EU-15 IN OPPOSING ONE.  ANY ADDITIONAL </p><p>SPECIFIC INFORMATION WASHINGTON AGENCIES COULD PROVIDE ABOUT </p><p>THE CONTINUED ACTIVITIES OF LIBYA\'S WMD AND MISSILE </p><p>ACQUISITION PROGRAMS -- ESPECIALLY ACTIVITIES COINCIDENT WITH </p><p>QADDAFI\'S CURRENT REINTEGRATION CHARM OFFENSIVE -- WILL HELP, </p><p>BUT ABSENT COMPELLING SPECIFIC EVIDENCE IS UNLIKELY TO CARRY </p><p>THE DAY.  ACTION REQUEST FOR NP: PLEASE PROVIDE ANY SPECIFIC </p><p>INTELLIGENCE-DERIVED INFORMATION REGARDING THE ACQUISITION </p><p>PROGRAMS\' RECENT ACTIVITIES THAT WE COULD SHARE WITH SCARANTE </p><p>AND OTHERS.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02763 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
