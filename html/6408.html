(U)  Quote </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>Socialist Republic of Vietnam </p><p> </p><p>Hanoi, 17 March, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Deputy Secretary, </p><p> </p><p>I would like to thank you for the letter dated 7 February </p><p>2003 with regard to the proposal of the Director General of </p><p>the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to increase </p><p>the IAEA\'s regular budget for safeguard in 2004-2005. </p><p>Vietnam has for many years supported general and complete </p><p>disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament and non- </p><p>proliferation.  Vietnam\'s signing of the Non-Proliferation </p><p>Treaty (1982) and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (1996) and </p><p>being a party to the Treaty on South East Asia Nuclear </p><p>Weapon Free Zone (1995) have all demonstrated our commitment </p><p>and contribution in the joint efforts of the international </p><p>community toward eliminating nuclear weapons and a peaceful </p><p>and more secure world.  I am also of the view that nuclear </p><p>energy has to be utilized for peaceful purposes and in </p><p>service of human life. </p><p> </p><p>The Agency, in fulfilling its mandates effectively, needs to </p><p>be provided with adequate resources.  In this regard, the </p><p>DG\'s proposal is very important, but it requires that all </p><p>member states work together to reach an agreement on the </p><p>issue.  In addition, it is worth noting that a balance </p><p>should be taken into account in allocating funding for </p><p>safeguard and technical assistance activities. </p><p> </p><p>Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely yours, </p><p> </p><p>//s// Nguyen Dinh Bin </p><p>Standing Deputy Minister </p><p> </p><p>The Honorable Richard L. Armitage </p><p>Deputy Secretary </p><p>U.S. Department of State </p><p>Washington, DC USA </p><p>end quote </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
