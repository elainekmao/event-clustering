Please handle </p><p>accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U) As a companion to the recently submitted Burma </p><p>investment climate statement, we want to summarize the key </p><p>problems that plague the country.  The full text of the </p><p>investment climate statement will be posted on the National </p><p>Trade Data Bank and is available via email from </p><p>wohlauerbv@state.gov. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  New U.S. investment in Burma has been illegal since </p><p>1997.  Burma is a country blessed with extensive natural </p><p>resources, low labor costs, and a great potential for </p><p>tourism.  It is also an ASEAN member.  However, even if </p><p>sanctions were removed, an extraordinarily hostile investment </p><p>climate would hold U.S. investment -- as it has held all </p><p>other investment -- to a very low level.  In Burma\'s FY </p><p>2001-02, flows of investment dropped nearly 90 percent from </p><p>the previous fiscal year to only $17.46 million for seven </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Burma\'s investment laws are relatively liberal, but </p><p>their implementation is racked, at all levels, with </p><p>corruption.  The ruling military junta, the State Peace and </p><p>Development Council (SPDC), has promised an "open door\' </p><p>economic policy and urged foreign firms to invest, but </p><p>regularly comes out with punitive and capricious regulations, </p><p>which make investment for foreigners difficult if not </p><p>possible.  The regulations are so vague and so conflicting </p><p>that it is almost impossible for an investor to be fully </p><p>confident that it is doing business "legally." </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Some lowlights of the past year: (1) an oral </p><p>directive forbidding renewal of existing trading permits, or </p><p>issuance of new ones, for foreign firms; (2) a increasing </p><p>disparity between the official exchange rate (6 kyat to the </p><p>dollar) and the market rate (1300 to the dollar and falling); </p><p>(3) continuing restrictions on the use of foreign exchange </p><p>for imports unless the imports are matched by exports; (4) </p><p>government expropriation of a foreign firm without </p><p>compensation; and, (5) increasing consumer boycotts in the </p><p>United States and Europe on products made in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Barring significant practical change, we do not </p><p>expect Burma\'s investment climate to improve.  We have not </p><p>seen any movement toward reform in recent years and expect </p><p>none in the immediate future.  In fact, if recent events are </p><p>any indication, the situation for investors will most likely </p><p>deteriorate in the period immediately ahead. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
