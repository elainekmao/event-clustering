<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 004551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: FUND MISSION AND GOT REACH AGREEMENT ON LOI, SHOOT </p><p>FOR AUGUST 1 BOARD DATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4480 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) IMF Mission Director Reza Mogdaham and State </p><p>Minister Ali Babacan announced July 20 that they had reached </p><p>initial agreement on a Letter of Intent.  In a brief </p><p>telephone call, IMF ResRep (protect) advised July 21 that, </p><p>assuming IMF management approval of the agreed-upon text, </p><p>they hope to sign the LOI this Friday (July 25) and have the </p><p>Board review the following Friday (August 1).  He said Fund </p><p>staff supported this accelerated approach to compensate for </p><p>some of the delays in completing the Fifth Review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) As reported reftel, the main factor facilitating </p><p>the agreement was the GOT\'s decision to take a series of </p><p>measures to close the projected TL 2.5 quadrillion fiscal gap </p><p>in this year\'s budget.  IMF ResRep said implementation of </p><p>these measures -- already underway -- along with </p><p>Parliamentary passage of the two remaining pieces of social </p><p>security legislation, without amnesty provisions, were prior </p><p>actions for the Board review.  We understand the full </p><p>Parliament will consider these two bills this week.  (Note: </p><p>The press reported last week that Parliament had approved the </p><p>legislation; in fact, only a Parliamentary committee had </p><p>approved them.  End note)  ResRep said a Fund technical </p><p>assistance team had made good progress working with the GOT </p><p>to narrow differences on a proposed social security amnesty. </p><p>Based on that, ResRep is now hopeful that the GOT\'s proposal </p><p>on this issue will address the Fund\'s concerns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) ResRep said Fund staff continue to work with GOT </p><p>officials on the Financial Management and Control Law as well </p><p>as direct tax reform legislation.  On the latter, he said the </p><p>GOT had "so many bad ideas" that Fund staff had asked them to </p><p>postpone the legislation, pending arrival of another Fund </p><p>technical assistance team.  Embassy will report more fully on </p><p>structural issues following a July 23 meeting with ResRep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Separately, the Central Bank intervened in the </p><p>currency markets in a big way on Friday, buying $940 million </p><p>above its normaly daily purchase in response to what the Bank </p><p>called excessive volatility.  The intervention (actually the </p><p>Bank intervened 2-3 times during the course of the trading </p><p>day) pushed the lira, which had reached TL 1.375 </p><p>million/dollar, back to TL 1.4 million/dollar before it </p><p>recovered to close at TL 1.395 million.  The Bank also cut </p><p>overnight interest rates three percentage points and </p><p>increased its daily dollar purchases from $40 to $50 million </p><p>late last week.  Local analysts, such as Istanbul-based </p><p>Bender Securities, are growing increasingly skeptical of the </p><p>Bank\'s claim that it is intervening only in response to </p><p>excessive volatility. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
