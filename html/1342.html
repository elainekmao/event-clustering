REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>LABOFF, PAID A CALL NOVEMBER 6 ON OLIVIA MUCHENA, </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA, A </p><p>MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, AND A MEMBER OF THE ZANU-PF </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  THE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT WAS TO </p><p>GAUGE THE WILLINGNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>(GOZ) TO ENTER INTO DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), AS </p><p>WELL AS OTHER CIVIL SOCIETY STAKEHOLDERS.  WHILE THE </p><p>VISIT WAS GENERALLY CORDIAL, THE MINISTER DISPLAYED </p><p>COMPLETE INTRANSIGENCE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF THE GOZ </p><p>ENTERING INTO DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION.  PERHAPS OF </p><p>EVEN GREATER CONCERN, SHE MADE CLEAR THAT THE GOZ WAS </p><p>MOVING FORWARD WITH ITS FAST TRACK LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM COME HELL-OR-HIGH-WATER, AND THAT </p><p>SHE EXPECTED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ANTE UP AT </p><p>THE END OF THE PROCESS TO MAKE IT ALL WORK.  A PINPOINT </p><p>OF HOPE WAS HER RECOGNITION THAT COMBATING THE HIV/AIDS </p><p>PANDEMIC IS AN ISSUE THAT REQUIRES COOPERATION BETWEEN </p><p>ALL SIDES. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD PAID A VISIT TO OLIVIA </p><p>MUCHENA, THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06283  01 OF 02  071644Z </p><p>WHO HAS ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  MUCHENA IS ALSO A MEMBER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT, A MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF ZANU- </p><p>PF, AND A TWENTY-YEAR SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>NO REASON FOR DIALOGUE WITH THE MDC </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AFTER EXCHANGING PLEASANTRIES, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT HE WANTED TO USE HIS OFFICE TO HELP </p><p>BRIDGE THE GULF THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS BETWEEN THE GOZ </p><p>AND ZANU-PF ON ONE SIDE, AND THE OPPOSITION MDC ON THE </p><p>OTHER.  THE AMBASSADOR REVEALED HIS CONCERN THAT </p><p>PRESSURE WAS INCREASING IN ZIMBABWE, AND THAT FOOD RIOTS </p><p>TWO WEEKS AGO MAY BE JUST THE FIRST INDICATION OF MORE </p><p>DISTURBANCES TO COME.  WHAT WAS NEEDED IS TO GET THE TWO </p><p>SIDES TALKING, AND THE AMBASSADOR WISHED TO BE A </p><p>CATALYST.  HE ASKED MINISTER MUCHENA WHAT WAS NEEDED TO </p><p>GET THE GOZ AND ZANU-PF TO SIT DOWN WITH THE MDC TO </p><p>START TALKING.  MINISTER MUCHENA STATED THERE WAS </p><p>NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT WITH THE MDC.  WHEN THE MDC MADE </p><p>THE MOTION TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT MUGABE, IT CLEARLY </p><p>INDICATED THERE WAS TO BE NO DIALOGUE.  THIS STEP, </p><p>COMBINED WITH REPEATED CALLS BY THE MDC LEADERSHIP FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S RESIGNATION BY DECEMBER, HAD SLAMMED </p><p>THE DOOR SHUT ON THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY TALKS BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO SIDES.  SHE STATED THERE COULD BE NO TALKS UNTIL </p><p>THE MDC WITHDREW ITS MOTION FOR IMPEACHMENT AND </p><p>RENOUNCED ITS CALLS FOR MUGABE TO RESIGN. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06283  01 OF 02  071644Z </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>NO REASON FOR DIALOGUE WITH THE CFU </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  THE AMBASSADOR THEN EXPRESSED HIS CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>THE ONGOING FAST TRACK LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM, AND ITS MOVEMENT FORWARD WITHOUT THE </p><p>COOPERATION OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) OR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DONOR COMMUNITY.  HE ASKED IF IT WOULDN\'T </p><p>BE USEFUL FOR THE GOZ TO TAKE A PAUSE IN THE PROGRAM, </p><p>SIT DOWN WITH THE CFU AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON A </p><p>PROGRAM THAT BOTH COULD SUPPORT, AND THEN PRESENT IT TO </p><p>THE DONORS FOR THEIR SUPPORT.  AT THIS POINT MINISTER </p><p>MUCHENA EMBARKED ON A VITRIOLIC DIATRIBE AGAINST THE </p><p>CFU.  SHE STATED THAT WHEN SHE HAD TRIED TO TALK WITH </p><p>THE CFU THEY HAD MOCKED HER AS A PERSON OF NO </p><p>CONSEQUENCE.  IN HER OPINION THE CFU HAD CONSISTENTLY </p><p>SABOTAGED EVERY REASONABLE ATTEMPT AT LAND REFORM OVER </p><p>THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, AND YET THEY ARE THE DARLINGS OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL DONOR COMMUNITY.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>RESPONDED BY INDICATING THAT THE CFU WAS PART OF THE </p><p>PROBLEM, BUT THAT THEIR COOPERATION WAS STILL ESSENTIAL </p><p>TO STRIKING ANY DEAL. </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD THEN CHANGED TACK AT THIS POINT AND </p><p>INDICATED THAT A SPECIFIC CONCERN OF HIS WERE THE FARM </p><p>WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ON THE COMMERCIAL FARMS WHO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8379 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06283  02 OF 02  071644Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------9C037C  071649Z /38 </p><p>P 071643Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7582 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006283 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AND AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06283  02 OF 02  071644Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/07/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE AMBASSADOR CALLS ON A MUGABE LOYALIST </p><p> </p><p>HAD BEEN THREATENED AND AT TIMES ASSAULTED SINCE </p><p>FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, AND WERE NOT BEING PLANNED FOR AS </p><p>FAR AS HE COULD TELL IN THE GOZ\'S RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM. </p><p>RATHER THAN RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE, MINISTER MUCHENA </p><p>LAUNCHED INTO ANOTHER DIATRIBE ON HOW BLACK ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>HAD BEEN UPROOTED IN THE 1952 - 1965 PERIOD, WITH THEIR </p><p>LAND AND ANIMALS STOLEN, FORCED TO BURN THEIR OWN HOUSES </p><p>AND POSSESSIONS.  SHE SAID THERE COULD BE NO DIALOGUE ON </p><p>LAND REFORM.  THE PEOPLE SUPPORT THE PROGRAM, AND THEY </p><p>WANT THE GOZ TO COMPLETE IT BY THE END OF NOVEMBER SO </p><p>THAT THE GOZ CAN GET ON TO OTHER BUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL SAVE THE DAY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD RETURNED TO THE GENERAL THEME </p><p>OF HIS CONCERN THAT TENSIONS WERE DANGEROUSLY INCREASING </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE AND THERE WAS A NEED FOR THE GOZ TO BEGIN </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION.  HE STATED HE WAS </p><p>CONCERNED WITH THE ANGER OF THE YOUTH IN THE HIGH- </p><p>DENSITY SUBURBS OF HARARE AND OTHER URBAN AREAS.  ANGER </p><p>OVER RISING FOOD PRICES, FUEL COSTS, AND ESPECIALLY THE </p><p>LACK OF JOBS, THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED, COMPOUNDED BY </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY THAT ZIMBABWE MAY FACE FOOD SHORTAGES IN </p><p>THE FUTURE DUE TO THE CURRENT RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06283  02 OF 02  071644Z </p><p>LANDLESS PEOPLE ARE JUST BEING TAKEN OUT TO COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS AND DROPPED OFF, WITHOUT THE GOZ BEING ABLE TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE AND INPUTS SUCH AS </p><p>SEEDS, FERTILIZER, AND TRACTORS THEY WILL NEED TO BE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL FARMERS, AND THIS SITUATION WOULD INEVITABLY </p><p>LEAD TO PROBLEMS FOR ZIMBABWE.  MINISTER MUCHENA </p><p>RESPONDED THAT HER VISITS TO THE HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS </p><p>HAD REVEALED THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE SUPPORTED THE GOZ AND </p><p>ZANU-PF AND THEY NOW REALIZE THEY HAD BEEN MISLED BY THE </p><p>MDC.  ON THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE BEING DUMPED ON FARMS </p><p>WITHOUT THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE, INPUTS, AND </p><p>SUPPORT, SHE LOOKED RIGHT AT THE AMBASSADOR AND STATED, </p><p>"YOUR GOVERNMENT CAN EASILY PROVIDE THESE THINGS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>AN ISSUE TO UNITE ZANU-PF AND THE MDC </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN A CLOSING EFFORT TO ELICIT SOME SLIVER OF </p><p>COMPROMISE FROM THE MINISTER, THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE </p><p>AIDS EPIDEMIC RAVAGING ZIMBABWE.  HE POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>THIS DISEASE DIDN\'T RECOGNIZE PARTY AFFILIATION, BUT IS </p><p>AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY KILLER OF BOTH ZANU-PF AND MDC </p><p>MEMBERS.  THIS ISSUE APPEARED TO STRIKE A CHORD WITH THE </p><p>MINISTER AND SHE LET HER GUARD DOWN SOMEWHAT, AGREEING </p><p>THAT ALL ZIMBABWEANS NEEDED TO WORK TOGETHER ON IT. </p><p>IGNORING THE PARTY ISSUE, SHE WENT TO HER DESK AND </p><p>HANDED THE AMBASSADOR A PAMPHLET ON A PROGRAM SHE HAD </p><p>DEVISED TO DEVELOP SPORTS LEAGUES FOR YOUTH IN RURAL </p><p>AREAS AND TO USE SPORTING EVENTS TO SPREAD THE MESSAGE </p><p>ABOUT HIV/AIDS AND ITS PREVENTION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06283  02 OF 02  071644Z </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: MINISTER MUCHENA\'S HARDLINE ATTITUDE IS </p><p>REFLECTIVE OF THE FORTRESS MENTALITY THAT HAS TAKEN HOLD </p><p>OF PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS SUPPORTERS IN THE GOZ AND </p><p>ZANU-PF.  HER DENIAL OF THE LOSS OF SUPPORT AND NON- </p><p>RECOGNITION THAT PRESSURE IS BUILDING FOR CHANGE, </p><p>NECESSITATING DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION, REFLECTS </p><p>ACCURATELY HOW OUT OF TOUCH THE HARDLINERS ARE.  MOST </p><p>WORRISOME, THOUGH, WAS HER STATEMENT THAT THE GOZ WOULD </p><p>PUSH AHEAD WITH AND COMPLETE BY THE END OF NOVEMBER THE </p><p>FAST TRACK LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, </p><p>IGNORING CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS, </p><p>DOMESTIC PUBLIC OPINION, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>THAT IT WILL BE DISASTROUS FOR ZIMBABWE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
