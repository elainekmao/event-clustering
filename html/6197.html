<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 09 GUATEMALA 000605 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR G/TIP, G, INL, DRL, PRM, IWI, WHA/PPC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, KWMN, SMIG, KFRD, ASEC, PREF, ELAB, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT--GUATEMALA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 22225 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The following are responses to questions in Ref A. </p><p>Additional information on Embassy projects and strategies to </p><p>combat trafficking can be found in Ref B. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Country Overview: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Is the country a country of origin, transit or </p><p>destination for international trafficked men, women or </p><p>children?  Are there any estimates of numbers of victims? </p><p>Are certain groups more at risk of being trafficked?  What is </p><p>the source of information? </p><p> </p><p>-- According to reports by the International Organization on </p><p>Migration (IOM), Casa Alianza, and an October 2002 report </p><p>from the DePaul University International Human Rights Law </p><p>Institute, Guatemala is a country of origin and transit for </p><p>international trafficking of persons and, in some instances, </p><p>is also a destination.  The trafficking is by land, air, and </p><p>sea, and it does occur within Guatemala,s borders.  Reliable </p><p>statistics do not exist on the magnitude of the problem. </p><p>Other than Guatemalans, other Central and Latin Americans </p><p>(notably Ecuadorians) are also being trafficked.  Victims </p><p>trafficked to Guatemala are usually young women or children </p><p>who are often brought in for sexual exploitation.  Those </p><p>trafficked from Guatemala for sexual exploitation are usually </p><p>minors, both boys and girls, from poor families.  Trafficking </p><p>is intimately related to international migration issues, as </p><p>the promise of arrival in the U.S. is often used to attract </p><p>desperate Latin Americans. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Where are the persons trafficked from?  Where are the </p><p>persons trafficked to? </p><p> </p><p>-- Trafficked persons come mainly from other Central American </p><p>countries and Ecuador.  Most are destined for the United </p><p>States or Mexico.  Some are destined for Guatemala.  In </p><p>addition to the trafficking of Latin Americans, smuggling of </p><p>Chinese, Afghans, Egyptians, Pakistanis and Syrians has been </p><p>noted in the past, and probably includes some cases of </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>C.  Have there been any changes in the direction or extent of </p><p>trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>-- Not to Embassy\'s knowledge.  Trafficking may have been </p><p>affected by a general slowdown in illegal migration into </p><p>Mexico after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the </p><p>U.S., economic decline in the U.S., and Mexican efforts to </p><p>prevent illegal entry from Guatemala.  Press reported that </p><p>Mexico deported 120,000 Central Americans from Chiapas state </p><p>in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>D.  Are any efforts or surveys planned or under way to </p><p>document the extent and nature of trafficking in the country? </p><p> Is any additional information available from such reports or </p><p>surveys that was not available last year? </p><p> </p><p>-- The July 2001 National Plan of Action to Combat Sexual </p><p>Exploitation of Minors included the goal of developing more </p><p>information on this problem related to trafficking.  To date </p><p>no survey or report has been produced, however.  The IOM in </p><p>2002 published results of a survey profiling the composition </p><p>of Guatemalan migrants, 92% of whom were destined for the </p><p>U.S.  It also features data on where come from, where they </p><p>settle in the U.S., remittances to Guatemala, and age and </p><p>social data.  IOM also produced a report on Sexual </p><p>Exploitation of children and adolescents in Guatemala in </p><p>cooperation with ECPAT International and Casa Alianza. </p><p> </p><p>E.  If the country is a destination point for trafficked </p><p>victims:  What kinds of conditions are the victims trafficked </p><p>into? Are they forced to work in sweatshops, agriculture, </p><p>restaurants, construction sites, prostitution, nude dancing, </p><p>domestic servitude, begging, or other forms of labor or </p><p>services? What methods are used to ensure their compliance? </p><p>Are the victims subject to violence, threats, withholding of </p><p>their documents, debt bondage, etc.? </p><p> </p><p>-- Conditions are pitiful.  Victims are subject to violence </p><p>and threat, but lack funds to return to their home countries. </p><p> Victims are often young women or children, brought here for </p><p>sexual exploitation and paid low salaries.  A study done by </p><p>the NGO "Pro Nino y Nina Centroamericanos" (PRONICE) in 1999 </p><p>suggests that fraud and threats are common forms of </p><p>recruitment.  Usually traffickers choose pretty girls from </p><p>poor families, and the most common "contracting places" are </p><p>along the borders. Asians, primarily Chinese, have also been </p><p>brought to Guatemala, though they are mainly being smuggled. </p><p>Those brought in have had to pay exorbitant rates for the </p><p>voyage and for false documents. </p><p> </p><p>F.  For countries of origin:  Which populations are targeted </p><p>by the traffickers?  Who are the traffickers?  What methods </p><p>are used to target the victims?  (Are they offered lucrative </p><p>jobs, sold by their families, approached by friends of </p><p>friends?)  What methods are used to move the victims (e.g., </p><p>are false documents being used?)? </p><p> </p><p>-- Sources in Guatemalan immigration indicate that victims </p><p>trafficked from Guatemala are generally poor people looking </p><p>for a better life for themselves and their families.  The </p><p>traffickers quite often approach these individuals and offer </p><p>them jobs that would allow them to make regular remittances </p><p>back to the family in Guatemala.  The main target population </p><p>for sexual exploitation is minors, both boys and girls, from </p><p>poor families or orphans.  The methods of approach include </p><p>promises of economic rewards, jobs in cafeterias or beauty </p><p>parlors, or jobs in other countries.  The means of promotion </p><p>include flyers, newspaper advertisements, and verbal/personal </p><p>recommendations.  The DePaul University study "In Modern </p><p>Bondage: Sex Trafficking in the Americas" cites evidence of </p><p>the following principal forms and agents of trafficking in </p><p>Guatemala:  1) "deceptions/false promise of employment" by </p><p>recruiters, intermediaries, and bar/brothel owners; 2) </p><p>"misadventure" with alien smugglers and truck drivers; 3) </p><p>abduction by common criminals; and, 4) "peer-influenced" </p><p>(primarily domestic) trafficking by friends and adolescents. </p><p> </p><p>G.  Is there political will at the highest levels of </p><p>government to combat trafficking in persons? Is the </p><p>government making a good faith effort to seriously address </p><p>trafficking?  Is there a willingness to take action against </p><p>government officials linked to it?  In broad terms, what </p><p>resources is the host government devoting to combat </p><p>trafficking in persons (in terms of prevention, protection, </p><p>prosecution)? </p><p> </p><p>-- The Attorney General\'s Office is currently investigating </p><p>allegations of abetting illegal migration against the </p><p>director of Migration and other immigration employees for </p><p>possible alien smuggling.  A former director was replaced </p><p>after similar charges surfaced.  Neither has yet been charged </p><p>with a crime. </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOG has shown some will to combat trafficking, but </p><p>much remains to be done.  To combat both smuggling and </p><p>trafficking, an ambitious plan was designed by the Central </p><p>American Commission of Migration Directors.  The plan aims to </p><p>address the problem of migration, and it includes assistance </p><p>to Guatemalans in foreign nations, assistance to Guatemalan </p><p>victims who return, reinsertion into society, local </p><p>development to diminish migration problems, protection of </p><p>human rights of immigrants, and educational and informational </p><p>campaigns.  The new agreement was signed in March 2001.  In </p><p>July 2001, the Cabinet approved a Plan of Action against </p><p>Sexual Exploitation of Minors and Adolescents.  The Ministry </p><p>of Foreign Relations also announced a special commission to </p><p>advise the President on the general issue of migration, and </p><p>has engaged in regular dialogue with Mexico on migration </p><p>enforcement issues. </p><p> </p><p>-- On enforcement, the GOG is using the immigration service </p><p>and the national police force to combat trafficking and has </p><p>had some victories.  A new computerized entry and exit system </p><p>has yielded some positive results with respect to combating </p><p>alien smuggling and should help fight trafficking as well. </p><p>However, no statistics exist for cases involving trafficking </p><p>per se.  Most deportations were of Ecuadorians in transit to </p><p>the U.S. who were probably victims of smuggling, rather than </p><p>of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>H.  Do governmental authorities or individual members </p><p>of government forces facilitate trafficking, condone </p><p>trafficking, or are otherwise complicit in such activities? </p><p>If so, at what levels? Do government authorities (such as </p><p>customs, border guards, immigration officials, local police, </p><p>or others) receive bribes from traffickers or otherwise </p><p>assist in their operation?  What punitive measures, if any, </p><p>have been taken against those individuals complicit or </p><p>involved in trafficking?  Please provide numbers when </p><p>available, of government officials involved, accused, </p><p>convicted and/or prosecuted. </p><p> </p><p>-- The involvement of government officials in trafficking has </p><p>not been documented.  However, credible press accounts allege </p><p>that corruption in the Guatemalan immigration service is </p><p>widespread and involves the acceptance of bribes to allow </p><p>individuals and groups to enter the country without proper </p><p>documentation.  Embassy believes some of this corrupt </p><p>activity involves cases meeting the definition of trafficking </p><p>in persons. </p><p> </p><p>-- No immigration officials have yet been prosecuted under a </p><p>2000 law against alien smuggling. </p><p> </p><p>I.  What are the limitations on the government\'s ability to </p><p>address this problem in practice?  E.g., is funding for </p><p>police or other institutions inadequate? Is overall </p><p>corruption a problem? Does the government lack the resources </p><p>to aid victims? </p><p> </p><p>-- Lack of resources, both manpower and money, is a major </p><p>limitation on combating this problem, as with </p><p>narco-trafficking and other trans-border problems.  With </p><p>unlimited crying needs and acute politically charged demands </p><p>on scarce resources, providing important resources to combat </p><p>trafficking is very difficult.  There is also the problem of </p><p>overall corruption that is pervasive throughout the GOG. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Prevention: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Does the government acknowledge that trafficking is a </p><p>problem in that country? If no, why not? </p><p> </p><p>-- In bilateral discussions about Migration Issues with </p><p>Mexico since 1996, the GOG has publicly acknowledged the need </p><p>to strengthen its efforts to combat the trafficking of </p><p>migrants.  The GOG has also acknowledged a related problem, </p><p>the sexual exploitation of minors.  In July 2001, the Cabinet </p><p>approved a National Plan of Action Against the Sexual and </p><p>Commercial Exploitation of Children and Adolescents in </p><p>Guatemala.  The Plan\'s strategic objectives include:  1) </p><p>survey social, economic, political, and social conditions </p><p>contributing to the problem, 2) assist and rehabilitate </p><p>victims, 3) apply justice and eliminate corruption </p><p>facilitating exploitation, and 4) increase awareness of the </p><p>problem and advance the plan.  The Presidential Secretariat </p><p>for Social Welfare developed the plan in cooperation with </p><p>other government agencies. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Director General of Guatemalan Migration has </p><p>acknowledged that trafficking in persons is a problem.  The </p><p>government does not have statistics, but every day Mexican </p><p>authorities deport approximately 400 people from Central and </p><p>South America through the border at El Carmen.  Many of these </p><p>people claim they had been taken with the promise that they </p><p>would be able to enter the U.S.  In Mexico, they are either </p><p>obligated to work with no pay or else they are prostituted. </p><p>Most of these people are probably victims of alien smuggling </p><p>rather than trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>B. Which government agencies are involved in anti-trafficking </p><p>efforts? </p><p> </p><p>--The following government agencies are involved in the </p><p>anti-trafficking efforts:  The Director General of Migration, </p><p>Immigration Defense from the Office of the Ombudsman, </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Relations, Presidential Secretariat of </p><p>Social Welfare, National Civilian Police, Labor Ministry, </p><p>Public Ministry, and the judiciary. </p><p> </p><p>C.  Are there or have there been anti-trafficking information </p><p>or education campaigns? If yes, briefly explain the </p><p>campaign(s), including their objectives and effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p>-- In December and January (2000-2001) the Embassy Public </p><p>Affairs Office, with $40,000 from INS, had three radio ads </p><p>and three television ads produced.  The ads ran heavily </p><p>during these two months, which INS had described as a high </p><p>traffic period.  In June 2000, Public Affairs sponsored </p><p>visits by two Guatemalan journalists on an INS "border tour" </p><p>to report on the dangers of trusting alien smugglers </p><p>("coyotes").  A 10-day training program for four radio </p><p>journalists from the border province of Huehuetenango in </p><p>January 2002 had a similar emphasis.  The journalists have </p><p>helped to spread Embassy\'s message discouraging travel with </p><p>smugglers. </p><p> </p><p>D.  Does the government support other programs to prevent </p><p>trafficking? (E.g., To promote women\'s participation in </p><p>economic decision-making or efforts to keep children in </p><p>school).  Please explain. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Human Rights Ombudsman\'s office maintains an Office in </p><p>Defense of Displaced and Migrant Populations which </p><p>investigates cases of trafficking.  They investigated one </p><p>case in 2002 involving possible trafficking of a Salvadoran </p><p>children, but determined that the children had parental </p><p>permission and were not victims of trafficking.  The </p><p>Ombudsman\'s Office also sponsored public information </p><p>campaigns during 2002 warning intending migrants of the risks </p><p>of illegal immigration and trafficking.  Other governmental </p><p>offices are dedicated to the Defense of Indigenous Women, </p><p>which provides legal advice to indigenous women victims of </p><p>domestic violence and abuse, Children\'s Rights, and Women\'s </p><p>issues, but none reported involvement in cases of trafficking </p><p>during the period of this report.  The GOG\'s Presidential </p><p>Secretariat of Social Welfare coordinated GOG cooperation </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>with civil society groups including religious, private, and </p><p>international NGOs under the National Plan of Action to </p><p>Combat Sexual Exploitation of Minors. </p><p> </p><p>E.  Is the Government able to support prevention programs? </p><p> </p><p>-- Government resources are severely strained and inadequate </p><p>in many areas, including combating trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>F.  What is the relationship between government officials, </p><p>NGOs, other relevant organizations and other elements in </p><p>civil society on the trafficking issue? </p><p> </p><p>-- Many NGOs are working on gathering information, providing </p><p>assistance, and preventing trafficking.  There are NGOs </p><p>working at the Guatemala-Mexico border, and human rights </p><p>organizations working with women, children, and migrants. </p><p>The government has provided some space for cooperative </p><p>programs through the immigration offices and the Office of </p><p>the Ombudsman. </p><p> </p><p>G.  Does the government adequately monitor its borders? Does </p><p>it monitor immigration and emigration patterns for evidence </p><p>of trafficking? Do law enforcement agencies respond </p><p>appropriately to such evidence? </p><p> </p><p>-- Guatemala,s borders are poorly policed and corruption is </p><p>rampant along both sides.  The computerized entry-exit system </p><p>is helping at the legal crossing points, but there are many </p><p>illegal crossing points available.  Mexico deported 120,000 </p><p>Central Americans from Chiapas in 2002.  Central American </p><p>deportees from Mexico are transported by USG-funded bus </p><p>service to the borders of El Salvador and Honduras under a </p><p>cooperative program between U.S., Mexican and Guatemalan </p><p>immigration authorities.  According to the local press, the </p><p>main deterrent to the flow of migrants is the poor treatment </p><p>of people who are detained in Mexico. </p><p> </p><p>H.  Is there a mechanism for communication and coordination </p><p>between various agencies, such as a multi-agency working </p><p>group or a task force? Does the government have an </p><p>anti-trafficking in persons task force? Does the government </p><p>have a public corruption task force? </p><p> </p><p>-- In order to provide a common forum for migration issues, </p><p>the National Association for Guatemalan Migrants has been </p><p>created.  This and other groups work together on human rights </p><p>issues with the Presidential Coordinator of Human Rights in </p><p>Guatemala.  Since April 2000 the government formed a </p><p>prosecutor\'s office for investigation and prosecution of </p><p>public corruption cases. </p><p> </p><p>-- In 2002 President Portillo named a new Anti-Corruption </p><p>Commission to implement a government initiative consisting of </p><p>corruption prevention, control, and sanctions.  Prevention </p><p>efforts will include efforts at professionalization of the </p><p>public service, reducing discretion, improving access to </p><p>information on public spending, and financial reform </p><p>legislation.  Control efforts will include improved internal </p><p>regulations, full implementation of financial administrative </p><p>systems, modernization of the Office of the Comptroller </p><p>General of Accounts, and greater citizen participation in </p><p>monitoring public spending.  Sanctions efforts are intended </p><p>to end impunity within and outside the government. </p><p> </p><p>I.  Does the government coordinate with or participate in </p><p>multinational or international working groups or efforts to </p><p>prevent, monitor, or control trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>-- Yes.  The Regional Commission of Central American </p><p>Migration Directors meets regularly to discuss issues </p><p>including trafficking.  The International Migration </p><p>Organization (IOM) has a regional office in Guatemala, and </p><p>cooperates with the government on several bilateral projects </p><p>to combat trafficking.  Guatemala is a member of the </p><p>11-member Regional Conference on Migration, and hosted a </p><p>meeting of the Conference in March 2002. </p><p> </p><p>J.  Does the government have a national plan of action to </p><p>address trafficking in persons? If so, which agencies are </p><p>involved in developing it? Were NGOs consulted in the </p><p>process? What steps has the government taken to disseminate </p><p>the action plan? </p><p> </p><p>-- No, but it does have a National Action Plan to Combat the </p><p>Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, as explained </p><p>above. </p><p> </p><p>K.  Is there some entity or person responsible for developing </p><p>anti-trafficking programs within the government? </p><p> </p><p>-- No, but this task falls under the general responsibilities </p><p>of the Director of Migration under the Interior Ministry. </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also committed to </p><p>addressing the problem. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Does the country have a law specifically prohibiting </p><p>trafficking in persons? If so, what is the law? If not, under </p><p>what laws can traffickers be prosecuted?  For example, are </p><p>there laws against slavery or the exploitation of </p><p>prostitution by means of coercion or fraud? Are there laws </p><p>being used in trafficking cases? Are these laws, taken </p><p>together, adequate to cover the full scope of trafficking in </p><p>persons? </p><p> </p><p>-- Guatemala has several laws that specifically prohibit the </p><p>trafficking and smuggling of persons, including the Law of </p><p>Immigration of 1998 (Legislative Decree 95-98), Article 194 </p><p>of the Criminal Code, and several articles of the migration </p><p>code.  In addition, there are other laws in the penal code </p><p>that could be applicable. Guatemala has signed several </p><p>international declarations regarding slavery.  The penal code </p><p>also regulates coercion and the sexual abuse of women against </p><p>their will. </p><p> </p><p>B.  What is the penalty for traffickers? </p><p> </p><p>-- The penalty for traffickers is 1-3 years in prison, plus a </p><p>fine of 2,500-15,000 quetzals ($320-1,923 at current exchange </p><p>rates).  Penalties are increased by 2/3 if the victim is </p><p>under 12, if the act was done with the intention to make a </p><p>profit, or if the act included use of deceit, violence or </p><p>abuse of authority. </p><p>C.  What are the penalties for rape or forcible sexual </p><p>assault? How do they compare to the penalty for trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>-- The penalty for rape is 6-20 years, and the penalty for </p><p>forcible assault is 2-5 years. The penalties for trafficking </p><p>are less severe and it is easy for traffickers and smugglers </p><p>to buy their way out by paying a prosecutor or judge. </p><p>D.  Has the government prosecuted any cases against </p><p>traffickers? If yes, provide number of arrests, indictments, </p><p>plea bargains, fines and convictions.  What were the </p><p>penalties actually imposed in each case?  Are the traffickers </p><p>serving the time sentenced?  If not, why not?  Please </p><p>indicate whether the government can provide this information, </p><p>and if not, why not. </p><p> </p><p>-- According to the DePaul Univ. report, "immigration and </p><p>police have increased arrests for smuggling, but further </p><p>identification of trafficking cases is not done."  A possible </p><p>exception to this statement are cases against illegal </p><p>adoption, or baby trafficking.  In February 2003, four </p><p>persons were reportedly arrested and accused of trafficking </p><p>in persons in two separate cases.  However, to date, we know </p><p>of no convictions. </p><p> </p><p>E.  Is there any information or reports of who is behind the </p><p>trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>-- There have been rumors that in cases involving the illegal </p><p>adoption of minors, both lawyers and notaries are directly </p><p>involved.  The Embassy believes that in some cases these </p><p>rumors are true. </p><p> </p><p>F.  Does the government actively investigate cases of </p><p>trafficking? Does the government use active investigative </p><p>techniques in trafficking in persons investigations? To the </p><p>extent possible under domestic law, are techniques such as </p><p>electronic surveillance, undercover operations, and mitigated </p><p>punishment or immunity for cooperating suspects used by the </p><p>government?  Does the criminal procedure code prohibit the </p><p>police from engaging in covert operations? </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOG will investigate cases of trafficking, but the </p><p>victims usually do not press charges.  Usually, the victims </p><p>of these crimes are women or minors, poor, and uneducated. </p><p>Access to the justice system for these people, while </p><p>improving, is still low.  One problem with criminal justice </p><p>in Guatemala is that the adversarial system is very new.  In </p><p>addition, lack of resources, and lack of training limit the </p><p>ability of the National Civilian Police and the prosecutors </p><p>to perform investigations.  Undercover agents are not allowed </p><p>under current law, and the surveillance of communications was </p><p>declared unconstitutional.  This makes investigations of </p><p>trafficking organizations more difficult. </p><p> </p><p>G.  Does the government provide any specialized training for </p><p>government officials in how to investigate and prosecute </p><p>incidences of trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>--No, the GOG does not provide specialized training for </p><p>government officials in investigating incidents of </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>H.  Does the government cooperate with other governments in </p><p>the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases? If </p><p>possible, can post provide the number of cooperative </p><p>international investigations of trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>-- In order to cooperate with the governments of other </p><p>countries, the GOG and most neighboring countries have signed </p><p>mutual legal assistance agreements.  In theory, this should </p><p>facilitate cooperation between countries in carrying out </p><p>investigations. </p><p> </p><p>I.  Does the government extradite persons who are </p><p>charged with trafficking in other countries? If so, can post </p><p>provide the number of traffickers extradited? Does the </p><p>government extradite its own nationals charges with such </p><p>offenses? If not, is the government prohibited by law from </p><p>extraditing its own nationals? If so, what is the government </p><p>doing to modify its laws to permit the extradition of </p><p>nationals? </p><p> </p><p>-- Extradition, including the extradition of Guatemalan </p><p>nationals, is allowed under the Guatemalan Constitution and </p><p>in various treaties and conventions.  We are unaware, </p><p>however, of any extradition requests for trafficking in </p><p>persons. </p><p> </p><p>J.  Is there evidence of government involvement in or </p><p>tolerance of trafficking, on a local or institutional level? </p><p>If yes, please explain in detail. </p><p> </p><p>-- There is no evidence to suggest that the Guatemalan </p><p>Government is involved in trafficking.  There are allegations </p><p>of individual corruption by government officials in relation </p><p>to orphan adoptions.  The United States and Canada have </p><p>instituted strong controls to decrease the possibility that </p><p>orphans go to those countries against the true desires of </p><p>their biological mothers.  There are several initiatives </p><p>within the Government of Guatemala, UNICEF, NGOs, and the </p><p>U.S. Embassy to reduce further the possibility of fraud and </p><p>coercion in international adoptions.  Most notably, on March </p><p>4, 2003, the Guatemalan Congress ratified the Hague </p><p>Convention on International Adoption. </p><p> </p><p>K.  If government officials are involved in trafficking, what </p><p>steps has the government taken to end their participation? </p><p>Have any government officials been prosecuted for involvement </p><p>in trafficking or trafficking related corruption? Have any </p><p>been convicted?  What actual sentence was imposed?
