<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000783 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IT, PREL, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S LUNCHEON WITH PRESIDENT CIAMPI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR MEL SEMBLER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: IN A PRIVATE LUNCHEON, ITALIAN PRESIDENT </p><p>CIAMPI EXPRESSED HIS DEEP CONCERN OVER A DETERIORATING </p><p>SITUATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS. HE MADE A </p><p>DETAILED ARGUMENT THAT ITALY CAN AND MUST BE BOTH PRO EUROPE </p><p>AND PRO US, WITH WHICH I AGREED. CIAMPI WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00783  151349Z </p><p>TO VISIT WASHINGTON FOR A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH; I </p><p>STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ITALIAN PRESIDENT CARLO AZEGLIA CIAMPI INVITED ME TO A </p><p>PRIVATE LUNCHEON FEB 12.  TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, IT WAS THE FIRST </p><p>TIME HE HAS EXTENDED SUCH AN INVITATION TO ANY AMBASSADOR. </p><p>THE DCM AND ANTONIO PURI PURINI, THE PRESIDENT\'S DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR, ALSO ATTENDED, ALONG WITH PRESIDENCY SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL GIFUNI. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CIAMPI DESCRIBED ITALY\'S RELATIONS WITH THE US AS </p><p>"FUNDAMENTAL".  HOWEVER GOOD THE RELATIONS WITH THE US ARE, </p><p>ADDED CIAMPI, THEY MUST GO, IN LARGE PART, VIA THE EU.  THIS </p><p>SAID, ITALY\'S RELATIONS WITH THE EU AND WITH THE US ARE NOT </p><p>IN COMPETITION.  I SAID THAT THE US UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF A STRONG EUROPE AND SUPPORTED IT.  DURING LAST WEEK\'S </p><p>VISIT TO ROME, NATO AMB. NICK BURNS UNDERLINED HOW MUCH WE </p><p>APPRECIATED THE LEADERSHIP ITALY IS BRINGING TO NATO, AND THE </p><p>ACTIVE ROLE ITALY PLAYS IN THE BALKANS AND IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>ITALY\'S RELATIONS WITH THE EU DO NOT THREATEN ITS TIES WITH </p><p>THE US. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CIAMPI DWELT ON ITALY\'S SPECIAL INTEREST IN ITS </p><p>IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS IN THE BALKANS, THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH </p><p>AFRICA.  SOUND WESTERN INVESTMENT AND ASSISTANCE IN THOSE </p><p>REGIONS NOT ONLY REDUCES THE PRESSURE FOR EMIGRATION TO </p><p>EUROPE, BUT ALSO UNDERMINES THE INFLUENCE OF FUNDAMENTALISM. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT HE RECENTLY HAD TOLD BOTH KOSOVO LEADER RUGOVA </p><p>AND MONTENEGRIN PRESIDENT DJUKANOVIC THAT ITALY OPPOSES </p><p>INDEPENDENCE FOR THOSE ENTITIES.  A NEW CROP OF BALKAN </p><p>"MINI-STATES" IS IN NO ONE\'S INTEREST; THEY WOULD BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00783  151349Z </p><p>OFFSHOOTS OF THE "MALIGNANT SEED OF NATIONALISM." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ON THE MIDDLE EAST, CIAMPI EXPRESSED HIS DEEP  CONCERN </p><p>OVER THE DETERIORATING SITUATION IN GENERAL AND SHARON\'S </p><p>APPROACH IN PARTICULAR.  I EMPHASIZED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH IS </p><p>DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE SITUATION, AND  THAT HE WOULD LIKE </p><p>THE EU AND THE US TO SPEAK WITH A SINGLE VOICE ON THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST: THE VIOLENCE MUST STOP; AND THEN THE PEACE PROCESS CAN </p><p>RESTART.  CIAMPI SAID THAT THE US IS THE ONLY POWER ABLE OF </p><p>BRINGING BOTH PARTIES TOGETHER, BUT ADMITTED THAT IT IS VERY </p><p>DIFFICULT TO DO SO UNDER THE CURRENT ATMOSPHERE OF VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) CIAMPI, NOW IN HIS THIRD YEAR AS PRESIDENT, SAID THAT </p><p>THE ONLY OFFICIAL VISIT HE HAD EVER MADE TO WASHINGTON WAS IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1993 WHEN HE WAS PRIME MINISTER. PURI PURINI SAID </p><p>THAT CIAMPI WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO AGREE ASAP ON A DATE FOR </p><p>A VISIT TO WASHINGTON, IDEALLY THIS FALL. I REPLIED THAT </p><p>SURELY IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE A STATE VISIT, BUT AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH WOULD BE VALUABLE.  CIAMPI SAID IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT </p><p>THAT IT BE A STATE VISIT, AS LONG AS HE COULD HAVE A </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION WITH THE PRESIDENT, AS THEY DID LAST </p><p>JULY IN ROME.  HE ADDED THAT HE VERY MUCH APPRECIATES THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S "HUMANITY, COMPASSION, AND STRAIGHTFORWARD </p><p>APPROACH". </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: CIAMPI REMAINS FAR AND AWAY THE MOST POPULAR </p><p>POLITICIAN IN ITALY (ACCORDING TO SOME POLLS, HE IS MORE </p><p>POPULAR THAN SUCH VENERABLE INSTITUTIONS AS THE CARABINIERI </p><p>AND THE CHURCH).  HE IS RESPECTED NOT ONLY AS THE ARCHITECT </p><p>OF ITALY\'S ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IN THE 1990S, BUT ALSO FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00783  151349Z </p><p>THE CRUCIAL ROLE HE PLAYS IN STABILIZING ITALY\'S DOMESTIC AND </p><p>FOREIGN POLICIES.  THAT THE HEAD OF STATE OF A MAJOR AND </p><p>STEADFAST NATO ALLY HAS NOT YET BEEN INVITED TO WASHINGTON IS </p><p>AN ANOMALY THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED.  I STRONGLY SUPPORT A </p><p>VISIT TO WASHINGTON THIS FALL AS A RECOGNITION OF ITALY\'S </p><p>STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE ROLE IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM, AND AS A </p><p>VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ENGAGE WITH A KEY </p><p>OPINION SHAPER IN ITALY.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00783 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
