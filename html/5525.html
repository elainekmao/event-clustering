<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000482 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/PPD, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, SCUL, PGOV, PHSA, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOK EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE EXTREMIST INFLUENCES IN </p><p>KUWAIT\'S EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PAO John Moran for reason 1.5 (b) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C/NF) Summary:  Embassy PAO met January 27 with Kuwait\'s </p><p>Minister of Education, Dr. Mus\'aad al-Haroun, to discuss his </p><p>ministry\'s efforts to reform the country\'s secondary school </p><p>curriculum and the (false) reports of embassy interference in </p><p>this process.  Al-Haroun, who obtained undergraduate and </p><p>doctoral degrees in education from the US, confirmed that his </p><p>ministry was in the process of working with a team of </p><p>religious scholars to clarify the definition and history of </p><p>"Jihad" in secondary school textbooks so that young people </p><p>would understand that Islam "is a religion of moderation that </p><p>respects other cultures and religions."  The effort, which </p><p>has engendered an outpouring of heated press editorials from </p><p>Islamists claiming that the Minister is seeking to redefine </p><p>Islam, is part of a broader program by the GOK to curb </p><p>extremist influences among the young.  Al-Haroun also said </p><p>that a highly confidential plan is in place to remove </p><p>teachers and principals who espouse conservative Islamist </p><p>principles from Kuwait\'s schools, and that a clamp-down on </p><p>what is being taught in Kuwait\'s Islamist-run summer camps is </p><p>in the works.  Post however has reason to doubt the strident </p><p>optimism expressed by the Minister in regard to long term GOK </p><p>determination or ability to reform the educational </p><p>curriculum.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) A number of recent reports and op/eds in Kuwait\'s </p><p>Arabic dailies have accused the US Embassy of being behind a </p><p>plan by the Ministry of Education to excise certain Quranic </p><p>references from textbooks used by Kuwaiti students at the </p><p>middle and high school levels.  Most reports allege that the </p><p>Ministry of Education plan involves removing the subject of </p><p>"Jihad" from the religious studies curriculum, and deleting </p><p>any reference to Israel as an enemy of Arabs and Muslims. </p><p>The editorial response from religious conservatives in Kuwait </p><p>has been predictably heated.  "If true, the US Embassy has </p><p>passed all boundaries," writes Islamist Khaled al-Sultan in a </p><p>representative commentary, while others lash out at the </p><p>Ministry of Education and Kuwaiti liberals in general as </p><p>seeking to rewrite or expunge sacred writ from the education </p><p>of young Kuwaitis.  In meetings, emboffs have been asked by </p><p>contacts why the embassy has embarked on such an intrusive </p><p>and counterproductive strategy; our response that these </p><p>allegations are false has not convinced many of our </p><p>interlocutors. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  During a meeting with Embassy PAO, Kuwait\'s Minister </p><p>of Education, Dr. Mus\'aad al-Haroun, said he has firmly </p><p>denied to members of the National Assembly and others in </p><p>Kuwait that the MOE has consulted with the embassy on the </p><p>issue of educational reform, and considers the allegation </p><p>merely a tactical move by Islamists to stifle his efforts to </p><p>reform Kuwait\'s secondary school curriculum.  Al-Haroun said </p><p>that the MOE has already put into place changes in the </p><p>secondary school curriculum in science, mathematics and </p><p>languages.  Now, he said, it\'s time for the social studies </p><p>and the Islamic studies segments to be reformed. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C)  Al Haroun said that newspaper reports that the MOE </p><p>planned to excise segments relating to the impossibility of </p><p>making peace with Israel were false, as the </p><p>Palestinian-Israeli issue was "too explosive politically" to </p><p>touch, but confirmed that his ministry was working with </p><p>religious scholars to come up with a segment that puts the </p><p>principle of "Jihad" into an appropriate modern context.  He </p><p>said that he is concerned that young people will read the </p><p>history of the early days of Islam, with its calls for the </p><p>elimination of polytheists and its delineated status for </p><p>"people of the book," as an invitation to intolerance and an </p><p>implied justification of al-Qaeda\'s message.  He said that </p><p>the point of the reform was not to remove references to </p><p>Jihad, but to explain it in a way that underscores respect </p><p>for all religions.  He said that many of those criticizing </p><p>this are merely grandstanding for upcoming parliamentary </p><p>elections, and that he has been "compelled" to meet with </p><p>Islamist organizations to assure them that the MOE does not </p><p>intend to take religion out of the curriculum or to re-write </p><p>the Quran.  Nonetheless, he said, the MOE is determined to </p><p>implement these changes, which he described as particularly </p><p>necessary for young men ages 14-18, and will not be dissuaded </p><p>by criticism. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) Al-Haroun also said that his ministry is moving to </p><p>get extremist teachers and principals out of the schools. </p><p>Whatever might be in the curriculum, he said, "we don\'t know </p><p>what goes on behind the classroom door."  He said that this </p><p>effort to rid the educational system of those who foster </p><p>unwholesome ideas is something that the government is going </p><p>about with extreme secrecy, and emphasized that the embassy </p><p>must keep this confidential.  He said the GOK is also very </p><p>concerned about what is being said in mosques and in the </p><p>summer and "spring break" camps run by Islamists for </p><p>children, and that the Council of Ministers has agreed that </p><p>they must move aggressively in this area as well.  Al-Haroun </p><p>said that Islamists in Kuwait were influential because they </p><p>are well organized and financed--"the only really </p><p>well-organized movement in the country"--but that he did not </p><p>think they posed a threat over the long-term.  The only </p><p>really dangerous elements, he said, were small cells of </p><p>extremists that he said were still active in the country. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment: Al-Haroun evinced great confidence that </p><p>curriculum reform issues and the other efforts to combat </p><p>extremist influence in Kuwait were moving apace, and that the </p><p>vast majority of Kuwaitis support these measures (or would </p><p>support them if they knew their extent.)  His manner </p><p>suggested determination that the GOK could and would make the </p><p>changes necessary to protect young people from the nefarious </p><p>influences of extremist Islam.  Of course, this is the </p><p>message we would want and expect to hear from official </p><p>Kuwaitis, so we\'re not too surprised to hear him say it. </p><p>According to newspaper commentary, Islamist influence in </p><p>education is deeply embedded, and includes not just doctrinal </p><p>training but anti-Western, anti-Christian intolerance and use </p><p>of peer and school pressure to stifle progressive attitudes </p><p>and perspectives.  Liberal contacts in the Kuwaiti media tell </p><p>us that liberals consider al-Haroun\'s educational reform </p><p>efforts as slow and ineffectual, and entertain doubts as to </p><p>his ability to move against this allegedly entrenched elite </p><p>of conservative Islamists. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Comment Continued: We also note that even with the </p><p>proposed clarification of Jihad in Kuwait\'s curriculum, the </p><p>Minister\'s declaration that references to Israel would remain </p><p>in their unreformed fashion makes us question the seriousness </p><p>of current GOK educational reform efforts.  An informal PAS </p><p>look at a section on the Arab-Israeli conflict from a </p><p>ninth-grade social studies textbook entitled "The Arab </p><p>World," for example, reveals the following text: </p><p>"Normalization is the main goal of the peace process.  This </p><p>normalization aims at perpetuating Israeli presence in the </p><p>region.  Peace from the Israeli perspective is a </p><p>comprehensive operation that targets the mind and heart of </p><p>the Muslim individual to remove his hatred of the Jews in </p><p>accordance with the holy Quran: \'And they will not cease from </p><p>fighting against thee until they have made thee a renegade </p><p>from thy religion, if they can. (Al Baqara 217)\'  The peace </p><p>challenge will always be there, especially since the </p><p>Arab-Israeli conflict is eternal, as per God\'s word in the </p><p>holy Quran: \'And the Jews shall not be pleased with thee, nor </p><p>will the Christians, until thou follow their creed. (Al </p><p>Baqara 120)."  PAS and POL section are now engaged in a </p><p>fuller review of Kuwaiti school textbooks to be reported </p><p>septel. </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
