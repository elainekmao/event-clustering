O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF Assesses Zimbabwe </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 531 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Unless the GOZ augments its recent </p><p>devaluation with additional reforms, a visiting </p><p>International Monetary Fund delegation predicted the </p><p>country will lose voting rights in June. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Alongside World Bank observers, the IMF team concluded </p><p>the annual "Article 4" review of the Zimbabwean economy </p><p>on March 12.  Southern Africa Chief Doris Ross </p><p>characterized Zimbabwe\'s recent devaluation as a "very </p><p>big step forward."  She also said the IMF appreciated the </p><p>GOZ\'s decision to begin "symbolic" payments of US$ 1.5 </p><p>million per quarter toward arrears.  At the same time, </p><p>the team encountered "different degrees of enthusiasm </p><p>within the Government" for reform.  The GOZ assured it, </p><p>however, that cabinet will soon consider relaxing price </p><p>and wage controls, proposals from the </p><p>government/industry/labor Tripartite Negotiating Forum. </p><p> </p><p>3. Ross also recounted a familiar litany of economic </p><p>distortions and challenges:  Real GDP off at least 30 </p><p>percent since 1998, inflation over 200 percent and </p><p>arrears around US$ 1.5 billion.  Meanwhile, monetary </p><p>policy remains wildly expansionary and negative interest </p><p>rates are promoting excessive borrowing.  Unsurprisingly, </p><p>the IMF suggested the GOZ tighten money supply, raise </p><p>interest rates and ease price controls. </p><p> </p><p>IMF\'s next step </p><p>--------------- </p><p>4. The IMF already suspended technical assistance to </p><p>Zimbabwe in June 2002.  It will vote on suspending voting </p><p>rights this June, using the final Article 4 report and </p><p>any further progress made in the next 3 months.  A </p><p>negative vote would be the final step before full </p><p>suspension from the lending body.  When pressed, the </p><p>delegation speculated that the GOZ has not yet enacted </p><p>sufficient reforms to survive the June vote. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. Ross made every effort to strike a hopeful tone.  But, </p><p>as we argued reftel, further reforms come at a higher </p><p>political price. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
