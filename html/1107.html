<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001676 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, EIND, ELTN, EWWT, FR, NL, SENV, EUN, FAA, IMO </p><p>SUBJECT: SECRETARY SLATER DISCUSSES TRANSPORTATION ISSUES </p><p>WITH DUTCH GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater visited the </p><p>Netherlands May 31 and June 1 to discuss transportation </p><p>issues with Dutch government and private sector officials. </p><p>Although front-burner issues such as hushkits were mentioned, </p><p>most of the conversations were broader, touching on the </p><p>future of the airline industry, road safety, shipping </p><p>regulation, and areas for future U.S.-Dutch cooperation. </p><p>Dutch Minister of Transportation Netelenbos sought U.S. </p><p>support for strengthening ICAO and for cooperation on </p><p>promoting international, rather than regional, rules for </p><p>regulation of shipping safety.  Secretary Slater described </p><p>DOT\'s efforts to consider the future of transportation -- </p><p>looking twenty-five years ahead -- and encouraged the Dutch </p><p>government and key private sector representatives (e.g., of </p><p>KLM and the Port of Rotterdam) to send representatives to </p><p>DOT\'s October 2000 conference in Washington.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Secretary Slater was accompanied during his visit to the </p><p>Netherlands by the following DOT officials: Deputy Chief of </p><p>Staff Norma Krayem, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Aviation </p><p>and International Affairs Bradley Mims, Office of </p><p>International Transportation Director Bernestine Allen, </p><p>Assistant to the Secretary for Public Affairs Mary Trupo, and </p><p>Director for Scheduling and Advance Natalie Hartman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dutch Government Views </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  During a June 1 meeting with Minister Netelenbos and </p><p>ministry officials, the Dutch government representatives made </p><p>the following key points: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The government of the Netherlands remains concerned with </p><p>implementation of the Hatch amendment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "Civil servants will have to work hard" to shepherd the </p><p>hushkit issue through the ICAO dispute settlement procedure. </p><p>It is good that the issue is being handled through </p><p>appropriate means.  More generally, ICAO needs to be </p><p>strengthened by speeding up its procedures and through an </p><p>input of political muscle.  It is too much "an organization </p><p>of civil servants." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Dutch are interested in reports of a possible United </p><p>Airlines/U.S. Air merger, and, indeed, in the future general </p><p>direction of airline mergers.  "We want competition, but </p><p>understand that it is a tough industry for individual </p><p>airlines to survive in."  The Dutch government is not privy </p><p>to KLM\'s thinking, but understands that KLM has been </p><p>approached by Portuguese, Greek, and Central European </p><p>airlines interested in discussing merger opportunities. </p><p>(Comment.  Recent media reports indicate the possibility of a </p><p>KLM/British Airways merger.  End comment.)  The Dutch would </p><p>be interested in learning of USG views on means of ensuring </p><p>an appropriate level of competition among airlines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Minister Netelenbos supports privatization of air traffic </p><p>control, in part because she believes ministry management of </p><p>air traffic control experts makes little sense.  However, </p><p>privatized control seeks to maintain a share of control, </p><p>while what is needed in Europe is consolidation.  One </p><p>alternative is for the government to grant a concession to a </p><p>private air traffic controller, with the understanding that </p><p>the concession could be withdrawn if performance was </p><p>inadequate.  Eurocontrol should take over management of high </p><p>altitude flights over Europe, but the militaries and the </p><p>French government resist this idea. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Dutch government is concerned that the French </p><p>government\'s enthusiasm for new shipping safety regulations, </p><p>in the wake of the sinking of the tanker Erika off the coast </p><p>of Brittany, is leading to proposed regulations that have not </p><p>been adequately considered.  Funding of enforcement, </p><p>shipbuilding capacity, and effects on shipping prices need </p><p>study.  Moreover, because the proposals are unlikely to </p><p>achieve world-wide acceptance, their imposition on a European </p><p>regional basis would drive substandard vessels towards Asia </p><p>-- something Japan would resist.  It would be better for the </p><p>U.S., EU, and Japan to consider common rules.  (In an aside, </p><p>Netelenbos wished the French would begin by enforcing </p><p>existing regulations.  She also noted that the Netherlands </p><p>had offered voluntarily to remove the still-leaking Erika </p><p>from the sea bed, an offer the French turned down.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Contrary to the Kyoto Protocol, CO2 is not diminishing </p><p>but increasing, and industry must conform to CO2 reductions. </p><p>Government and industry must address the negative impact of </p><p>road and air traffic growth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Secretary Slater said that the U.S. and the Netherlands </p><p>have similar interests in ensuring air safety and noise </p><p>reduction.  That should make solutions to outstanding issues </p><p>possible.  It is necessary to get the hushkits dispute out of </p><p>the way so we can move forward on the more important Stage IV </p><p>noise level discussions.  The Secretary said that he could </p><p>not yet comment on the possible merger between U.S. airlines </p><p>because the facts are still forthcoming.  He noted that DOT </p><p>is undertaking a long-term study of transportation needs and </p><p>welcomes international comments and involvement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dutch Industry Views </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Secretary met on May 31 with leading Dutch private </p><p>sector representatives at a meeting organized by the VNO-NCW </p><p>(Dutch industry federation).  Following were the main </p><p>discussion points: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Schiphol airport, Europe\'s fourth busiest, needs to grow </p><p>in order to afford investments required to remain </p><p>competitive.  The overall approach is to apply an overall </p><p>"noise budget" to Schiphol, within which it must optimize its </p><p>traffic.  Schiphol would like to establish freight service to </p><p>and from Atlanta to become an even greater gateway for </p><p>U.S.-EU trade. (Mr. Verboom, Schiphol Airport) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Container cargo is rapidly increasing.  The Port of </p><p>Rotterdam, already the world\'s largest, expects to increase </p><p>the number of containers it handles from the current 6 </p><p>million a year to 12 million a year over the next twelve </p><p>years.  Cargo handling is becoming a high technology industry </p><p>and calls out for standardization of new technologies between </p><p>the U.S. and EU.  (J.M. Dekkers, Europe Combined Terminals BV) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  There is concern in Europe that the U.S. is moving </p><p>towards a new 47-foot container standard, in addition to the </p><p>current 20 and 40-foot containers.  This would complicate </p><p>transatlantic cargo movement.  The U.S. and EU should </p><p>consider common standard container sizes.  (Th. W. Aris, </p><p>Transport Management International) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Dutch have begun a radical rethinking of highway </p><p>safety, introducing the concept of "sustainable safety," and </p><p>would appreciate communication with U.S. experts in the </p><p>field.  The current annual highway death toll in the </p><p>Netherlands is 1,000 per year.  The goal should be to reduce </p><p>it by a factor of ten.  (F.C.M. Wegman, Dutch Institute for </p><p>Road Safety) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Secretary Slater told the private sector gathering that </p><p>the Administration has taken a strong position that </p><p>transportation is a policy area that requires close </p><p>government-private sector partnership.  It is also a policy </p><p>area that requires long-term and forward-looking examination. </p><p> DOT has therefore initiated a policy of looking towards the </p><p>transportation needs of 2025 in close conjunction with </p><p>industry.  Globalization is a fact and transportation an </p><p>integral part of it.  DOT welcomes contact with European </p><p>governments and the private sector and looks forward to their </p><p>participation in a major conference that DOT will host in </p><p>Washington in October. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>P.S. The Ubiquitous Dutch Bicycle </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  No discussion of transportation in the Netherlands is </p><p>complete without mention of the bicycle.  Dutch officials, </p><p>including Minister Netelenbos and Ton Welleman, Project </p><p>Manager of the Dutch Bicycle Master Plan for the Transport </p><p>Ministry, were skeptical that the Dutch experience has much </p><p>to offer to the U.S., but were pleased that the bicycle </p><p>remains center stage in the Netherlands, with 6 million </p><p>bicycles used for 30 percent of all travel within the </p><p>country.  The current problem for the Netherlands is the </p><p>600,000 bicycle thefts which occur annually, a problem the </p><p>Ministry is considering addressing by inserting computer </p><p>chips into bicycles.  Both Minister Netelenbos and Ton </p><p>Welleman, to the surprise of the U.S. delegation, were </p><p>adamant that mandatory helmet laws even for children made no </p><p>sense for the Netherlands.  Accident rates are low, the Dutch </p><p>are good bicyclists, and (more to the point) no government </p><p>could propose such a measure because it would be universally </p><p>condemned and ignored.  Secretary Slater replied that the </p><p>U.S., and particularly individual cities, are more </p><p>enthusiastic about increasing bicycle use than the Dutch </p><p>might think. </p><p>FENDRICK </p><p></p></div>
