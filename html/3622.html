(A) KATHMANDU 1680 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1674 </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Maoist insurgents continued their campaign of </p><p>bombings in urban areas of the Kathmandu Valley throughout a </p><p>long holiday weekend August 30-September 1.  The explosions </p><p>targeted businesses in the city, although two armed invasions </p><p>of the homes of prominent politicians were also reported. </p><p>Prime Minister Deuba, returning to the capital September 2, </p><p>told reporters he had not yet decided whether to extend the </p><p>state of emergency, which expired August 28.  The bombings, a </p><p>preface to a Maoist general strike declared for September 16, </p><p>demonstrate the insurgents\' ability--even after nine months </p><p>of a state of emergency--to penetrate the extensive security </p><p>cordon within the fortified capital.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>BOMB BLASTS JOLT CAPITAL </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Suspected Maoist insurgents have followed up an August </p><p>28 explosion at a shopping center in downtown Kathmandu (Ref </p><p>B) with a string of similar incidents--almost daily--in busy </p><p>commercial locations across the city.  As noted Ref B, the </p><p>string of bombings coincides both with the expiration of the </p><p>state of emergency, which had been in near-continuous </p><p>operation since late November, and the onset of a </p><p>Maoist-declared "agitation campaign" to publicize a general </p><p>strike, or "bandh," the insurgents have scheduled for </p><p>September 16.  Although only one person--an Army soldier </p><p>attempting to defuse an explosive device August 29--has been </p><p>killed in the blasts, the series of explosions is unnerving a </p><p>capital made complacent by a comparatively quiet summer. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In the early morning of August 29 a Royal Nepal Army </p><p>(RNA) soldier attempting to defuse a bomb in Patan, about 6 </p><p>km from the Embassy, was killed when the device detonated. </p><p>The bomb had been wrapped in red cloth and placed near a </p><p>utility pole at an intersection.  On August 30--a religious </p><p>holiday in Nepal--another early-morning bomb damaged a </p><p>municipal office in Lalitpur, approximately 6 km from the </p><p>Embassy.  The RNA successfully defused another device left </p><p>near a Nepal Telecommunications Corporation building in </p><p>Kathmandu  August 31.  On September 1 separate explosions at </p><p>an automobile showroom and near an ambulance parked outside </p><p>the state-owned Salt Trading Corporation, both in downtown </p><p>Kathmandu, caused extensive damage but no injuries.  As in </p><p>the earlier incidents, the explosions occurred in the early </p><p>morning well before normal business and school hours. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>ATTACKS ON POLITICIANS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Suspected Maoists have also staged attacks on the </p><p>homes and persons of at least two politicians in the past few </p><p>days.  On  August 30 insurgents set fire to the home of </p><p>Minister of State for General Administration D.B. Lama in </p><p>Nuwakot District, 70 km due north of Kathmandu.  The minister </p><p>was not home at the time, and no one was injured in the </p><p>blaze.  On September 1 the president of a local Nepali </p><p>Congress district committee was shot by suspected insurgents </p><p>at his home in Bhaktapur, 18 km east of Kathmandu.  He </p><p>remains in critical condition at a Kathmandu hospital.  On </p><p>August 28 unidentified gunmen invaded the Kathmandu home of a </p><p>former MP of the Nepal Sadbhavana Party, injuring his wife </p><p>and child, and making off with an unspecified amount of cash </p><p>and property.  (Note:  While it seems probable that common </p><p>criminals, rather than Maoists, performed the latter attack, </p><p>the success of this bold, broad-daylight home invasion in the </p><p>heart of Kathmandu is just one more sign of the overall </p><p>deterioration of law and order brought on by the insurgency. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>RETURN TO EMERGENCY? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The Maoists\' success in setting off a series of </p><p>explosions in the heavily fortified capital has raised </p><p>speculation that Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba will ask </p><p>the King to re-impose the state of emergency.  (Note:  The </p><p>emergency expired August 28, while the PM was on an official </p><p>visit to EU headquarters in Brussels.  End note.)  Returning </p><p>to Kathmandu September 2, Deuba told reporters at the airport </p><p>that he would weigh carefully whether to ask the King to </p><p>re-impose the emergency after he consulting with his Cabinet, </p><p>members of the security forces, and others.  He assured </p><p>reporters, as he has in the past, that the emergency, if </p><p>re-imposed, will be lifted before general elections November </p><p>13. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Because of the early-morning timing of the </p><p>explosions, it seems likely their purpose is to terrorize the </p><p>general population and embarrass the security forces, rather </p><p>than to kill and maim.  After a fairly quiet summer, many </p><p>Kathmanduites--probably including many within the upper ranks </p><p>of the security forces--were beginning to feel complacent, </p><p>confident that the RNA and a nine-month state of emergency </p><p>had successfully banished most of the insurgents to the </p><p>hinterlands.  The insurgents\' activities over the past few </p><p>days have punctured some of that complacency.  After several </p><p>costly defeats in May and June, the Maoists have launched no </p><p>large-scale operations against the security forces.  It is </p><p>too soon to tell if the losses have affected the Maoists\' </p><p>ability to mount such operations in the future, or if they </p><p>have been lying low on purpose, regrouping, retraining and </p><p>recruiting during the monsoon.  Regardless of the reasons for </p><p>their lack of activity, the long period of quiet has put </p><p>pressure on the Maoists to demonstrate to their own cadre, to </p><p>the Army, and to the general public, that they can still </p><p>wreak havoc--even via small-scale activities like the string </p><p>of bombings.  Their ability to pull off such operations, </p><p>literally under the noses of the Army and police in the </p><p>heavily defended capital, is likely just enough to cow most </p><p>of the urban population into adhering to the September 16 </p><p>strike and to mobilize public support for re-imposition of </p><p>the emergency.  We expect the PM will soon ask the King to </p><p>re-impose the state of emergency for at least the next two </p><p>months. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
