<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ADANA 0470 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  KURDS, AND PKK, CONTINUE TO SPREAD WEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: ADANA 0468 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2. RECENT REPORTING FROM ADANA AND OTHER POSTS IN </p><p>TURKEY HAS FOCUSSED ON THE MASS MIGRATION OF KURDS </p><p>FROM THE SOUTHEAST INTO THE LARGE CITIES OF THE WEST. </p><p>AN ITEM IN THURSDAY\'S ADANA PRESS SUMMARY SHOWS HOW </p><p>KURDISH MIGRATION IS ALSO PUTTING THE SQUEEZE ON </p><p>TURKISH RESIDENTS IN SMALLER TOWNS BORDERING ON THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL KURDISH AREAS -- AND BRINGING WITH IT THE </p><p>PKK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ACCORDING TO A "MILLIYET" ITEM ON SEPTEMBER 9 </p><p>(PARA 5, REFTEL), PKK MILITANTS ATTACKED THE </p><p>SUMERBANK (A GOVENMENT-OWNED COOPERATIVE) YARN MILL </p><p>IN THE TOWN OF PERTEK ON THE NIGHT OF SEPT 6, KILLING </p><p>THE MILL\'S PLANNING CHIEF AND A SECURITY GUARD.  THE </p><p>MILITANTS THEN TORCHED THE MILL.  SECURITY TROOPS </p><p>REPORTEDLY ARRIVED AS THE MILITANTS WERE LEAVING, AND </p><p>KILLED ONE.  THE REST PRESUMABLY ESCAPED.  PERTEK, A </p><p>TOWN IN TUNCELI PROVINCE ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN </p><p>TUNCELI AND ELAZIG ON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE KEBAN </p><p>RESERVOIR, HAS BEEN ALMOST WHOLLY POPULATED BY ETHNIC </p><p>TURKS SINCE THE ARMENIAN RESIDENTS WERE REMOVED OR </p><p>EXTERMINATED DURING WORLD WAR I.  THE MOTHER OF ONE </p><p>OF CONSULATE ADANA\'S EMPLOYEES HALES FROM PERTEK, AND </p><p>THE EMPLOYEE KNOWS THE TOWN, AND WAS A DISTANT </p><p>RELATIVE OF ONE OF THE MEN KILLED IN THE YARN MILL </p><p>ATTACK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO THE EMPLOYEE\'S RELATIVES, THERE HAD </p><p>BEEN NO SIGNS OF KURDISH UPRISING VIOLENCE IN THE </p><p>TOWN UNTIL THIS SUMMER, AND THE ATTACK ON THE MILL </p><p>WAS THE FIRST ATTACK EVER INSIDE THE TOWN.  THE ONLY </p><p>OTHER PREVIOUS INCIDENT, ALSO THIS SUMMER, INVOLVED </p><p>GUNMEN -- PRESUMABLY KURDISH MILITANTS -- FIRING DOWN </p><p>ON A NEARBY JANDARMA STATION FROM SURROUNDING HILLS. </p><p>THE ATTACK ON THE MILL, HOWEVER, WAS DIRECTED AGAINST </p><p>A GOVERNMENT-OWNED FACTORY, AND INCIDENTALLY, THE </p><p>ONLY MAJOR EMPLOYER IN TOWN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FROM THE TIME OF THE ARMENIAN REMOVALS UNTIL THE </p><p>LAST 4 OR SO YEARS, PERTEK HAD REMAINED ALMOST </p><p>EXCLUSIVELY TURKISH.  IN THE LAST 4 YEARS, LARGE </p><p>NUMBERS OF ZAZA KURDS FROM TUNCELI HAVE MOVED INTO </p><p>THE TOWN, BOUGHT PROPERTY AND BUILT HOUSES, ALL </p><p>APPARENTLY HOPING TO ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE IN AND </p><p>AROUND TUNCELI.  THE NUMBERS OF KURDS AND TURKS IN </p><p>PERTEK ARE NOW ABOUT EQUAL, OR PERHAPS EVEN WEIGHTED </p><p>SLIGHTLY IN FAVOR OF THE KURDS.  THE TWO GROUPS DO </p><p>NOT MIX, AND KEEP THEIR DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER. </p><p>KURDISH MEN DO NOT, FOR EXAMPLE, GO TO TURKISH TEA </p><p>HOUSES, AND VICE VERSA. </p><p> </p><p>6.  EVEN BEFORE THE PKK FOLLOWED THE KURDISH </p><p>MIGRANTS, MANY ETHNIC TURKS HAD ALREADY LEFT PERTEK, </p><p>CITING THE OTHER PROBLEMS THE KURDISH MIGRANTS </p><p>BROUGHT WITH THEM.  HOWEVER, OUR EMPLOYEE\'S RELATIVES </p><p>HAVE RESISTED, HAVING THEIR ROOTS AND BUSINESSES IN </p><p>TOWN.  IT WILL BEAR WATCHING WHETHER THIS ATTACK, AND </p><p>THE RESULTING JOBLESSNESS, WILL ACCELERATE THE </p><p>TURKISH FLIGHT FROM SMALL TOWNS LIKE PERTEK. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT: IN THE PAST MONTH OR SO, THE TURKISH </p><p>PRESS HAS REPORTED GREAT GOVERNMENT SUCCESS IN THE </p><p>SOUTHEAST, CITING FIGURES OF OVER 1000 PKK </p><p>FATALITIES.  THESE REPORTS ARE PRESUMABLY BASED ON </p><p>TGS PRESS RELEASES, WHICH PROBABLY HAVE MORE </p><p>PROPAGANDA THAN NEWS VALUE.  BUT WHILE THE TGS IS </p><p>CLAIMING VICTORY IN THE AREAS AROUND HAKKARI, SIRNAK, </p><p>AND DOGUBEYAZIT, THE PKK CONTINUES TO STRIKE IN OTHER </p><p>PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST.  AS THIS AND OTHER ATTACKS </p><p>SHOW, THE MILITANTS CAN EVEN VENTURE INTO NEW AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  FURTHER COMMENT: ALTHOUGH THE PRESS REPORTS </p><p>REFERRED TO THE ATTACKERS AS PKK MILITANTS, AND THERE </p><p>IS NO EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, TUNCELI PROVINCE HAS </p><p>BEEN A BASE FOR THE TURKISH WORKERS AND PEASANTS </p><p>LIBERATION ARMY (TIKKO).  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TIKKO </p><p>ELEMENTS CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK, BUT THE LARGER AND </p><p>MORE NOTORIOUS PKK GOT THE CREDIT.  END COMMENTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WARREN </p><p></p></div>
