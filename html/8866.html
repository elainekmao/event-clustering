<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB AND WHA </p><p>USDA FOR LINDA DETWILIER </p><p>APP WINNIPEG SENDS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, PREL, OTRA, CA, Manitoba </p><p>SUBJECT: MANITOBA CONSERVATION LEADER REGISTERS CONCERN IN </p><p>BSE CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>1. On 19 June, Manitoba Conservative Party leader (and head </p><p>of Manitoba\'s Official Opposition in the Legislature) Stuart </p><p>Murray visited new APP Winnipeg Consul to formally register </p><p>the concerns of his constituents at the ongoing freeze of </p><p>Canadian beef import into the United States.  He specifically </p><p>asked if there was anything else that political leaders or </p><p>beef producers could do to speed the reopening of the border. </p><p> Further, noting that some U.S. Senators had suggested </p><p>reopening the border to Canadian beef could take as long as </p><p>seven years, Murray asked if Consul had any indication as to </p><p>how long the process might really take or if he saw any light </p><p>at the end of the tunnel. </p><p> </p><p>2. Consul responded that while he was quite new to Canada and </p><p>to the office, his initial impression was that the Canadian </p><p>government was being quite cooperative and thorough in its </p><p>investigation of the Alberta outbreak.  He underscored that </p><p>the USG\'s responsibility first and foremost was the </p><p>protection of U.S. consumers, but that the U.S. also </p><p>understood the pain inflicted on Canadian ranchers.  Consul </p><p>said that the U.S. would do everything it could to reopen the </p><p>border to Canadian beef as quickly as possible, but added </p><p>that any such decision must be based on sound science.  He </p><p>pointed out that the task -- proving the existence of a </p><p>negative -- was logically impossible, but that the U.S. would </p><p>have to have a high confidence level in the science before </p><p>acting. </p><p> </p><p>3. Murray asserted his belief that there was some political </p><p>angle to the continuing ban.  Pointing both to the obvious </p><p>benefits to the U.S. cattle industry of the border closure to </p><p>the U.S. beef, as well as the recent decline in U.S.-Canadian </p><p>relations and what he described as the poor relationship </p><p>between PM Chretien and President Bush, Murray said the </p><p>purpose of his call was to send the message that Manitoba\'s </p><p>political leaders wanted to see the situation resolved </p><p>quickly.  Consul agreed to report his views to Ottawa and </p><p>Washington, and provided Murray with an June 6 backgrounder </p><p>from USDA on BSE.  Consul also offered to keep Murray </p><p>informed of any new developments he became aware of. </p><p> </p><p>4. COMMENT:  It is worth noting that under Murray\'s </p><p>leadership, the Conservative party lost 4 of its 24 seats in </p><p>the legislature in the June 3 provincial elections, and local </p><p>press reports suggest Murray may face a leadership challenge </p><p>in the next few months.  While Murray\'s concern for Manitoba </p><p>farmers is real and justified, his approach to APP Winnipeg </p><p>may also represent his desire to show himself as a man of </p><p>action. End Comment. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
