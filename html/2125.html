<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002787 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/2011 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: THE LATEST IN THE IMF SAGA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2301 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. Classified by Charge d\'Affairs Timothy D. Andrews for </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) EconOff spoke October 31 to Ernest Ebi, Deputy </p><p>Governor for International Operations at the Central Bank, to </p><p>discuss the IMF program.  Ebi confirmed that the IMF had </p><p>decided not to extend the SBA and that a new IMF team would </p><p>arrive October 31 to begin discussions on a monitoring </p><p>program.  On October 26, the IMF had dispatched Messrs. </p><p>Goodall Gondwe and Hiroyuki Hino to convey this message to </p><p>President Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to British colleagues in Abuja, President </p><p>Obasanjo agreed to discuss the details of putting in place a </p><p>monitoring program, similar to (but not called) a Staff </p><p>Monitored Program (SMP).  A monitoring program would only </p><p>require approval by the IMF Managing Director, not the Board. </p><p> While it does not have the Board sanction it would carry </p><p>with it the financial discipline of an SBA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) With a monitoring program in place, the IMF would then </p><p>look to develop either a new one-year SBA or possibly a </p><p>3-year Poverty Reduction and Growth facility program (PRGF). </p><p>A PGRF is a concessional facility with 0.5 interest rate, </p><p>with repayment of 10 years and grace period of 5.6 years. </p><p>The key to developing a PGRF is for the GON to produce an </p><p>IMF-approved Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PSRP). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) However, a PRGF would require significantly more time </p><p>to develop than a SBA.  Moreover, with the 2003 elections </p><p>approaching, success over a 3-year period may be difficult to </p><p>achieve and early success difficult to ascertain.  A new </p><p>one-year SBA may be the best way to proceed as it could be </p><p>put in place more quickly and is easier to monitor. </p><p>Undoubtedly, the GON will push for a medium-term facility, </p><p>such as the PRGF, that might allow the GON to initiate </p><p>discussions on debt forgiveness with the Paris Club. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Without a SBA, the Paris Club is in uncharted </p><p>territory.  A monitoring program does not necessarily provide </p><p>the assurances on reform sought by the Paris Club </p><p>governments.  Consequently, the Paris Club may need to </p><p>reexamine the criteria for negotiating debt rescheduling </p><p>agreements.  If negotiations are halted, Nigeria will face </p><p>accelerated debt service payments in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In the August 2001 review of Standby Arrangement (SBA) </p><p>the Fund found that serious macroeconomic imbalances had </p><p>emerged in Nigeria over the last year. Inflation has </p><p>accelerated to double-digit levels since August of 2000 </p><p>(19.7% in July 2001), and instability has prevailed in the </p><p>foreign exchange market with the premium in the parallel </p><p>market rising to 19%.  An index of the purchasing power of </p><p>the Naira (a rough indicator of changes in competitiveness) </p><p>has fallen to new lows as inflation has increased and the </p><p>IFEM has remained static.  In September, the IMF had declared </p><p>talks on the SBA to be inconclusive (reftel).   A high </p><p>ranking GON delegation visited the IMF in Washington in </p><p>September and convinced the Fund not to abandon the program </p><p>entirely.  The GON also wanted the SBA continued until at </p><p>least December; that now will not happen.  The SBA expires </p><p>today (October 31). </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
