<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001704 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E FOR U/S LARSON, SECOR </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA--MILLS/CHANG </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETTC, ECON, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: JORDANIAN MARKETS REACT CALMLY TO START OF </p><p>HOSTILITIES </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  We have been in touch with the finance ministry, </p><p>central bank, and local bankers, and have reported in our </p><p>sitreps and other messages that Jordanian financial markets </p><p>have been calm, with no exceptional demand for dollars or </p><p>withdrawal of deposits.  There has been no pressure on </p><p>foreign exchange reserves. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  The stock market index closed up 1.25% on Thursday </p><p>(closed on Friday, Saturday).  The biggest gainers were </p><p>industrial companies that might participate in Iraq </p><p>reconstruction and more liberal trade with Iraq.  Banks have </p><p>lots of cash dollars on hand to meet any extraordinary demand </p><p>for banknotes, and have had no problems with correspondent </p><p>banks outside the region. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  In addition, the central bank has ordered </p><p>commercial banks to freeze deposits of the Iraqi government </p><p>and known fronts and to monitor all other Iraqi accounts for </p><p>suspicious movements. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  The oil flow from Iraq has stopped, and there </p><p>appears to have been a smooth shift to use of stocks in Aqaba </p><p>and Zarqa.  Along with the common understanding that the Gulf </p><p>countries will provide concessional oil, this has been </p><p>reassuring.  (FM Muasher told the Ambassador March 21 that he </p><p>had been in touch with the Saudis, UAE, and Kuwaitis to nail </p><p>down the final logistical and financial details.)  Markets </p><p>are also reassured by the high level ($3.5 billion) of </p><p>official foreign exchange reserves. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  QIZ exports have been able to continue as the </p><p>Israeli border remains open for shipments via Haifa and Aqaba </p><p>port remains open.  Non-regional carriers have sharply </p><p>curtailed air service, but the airport remains open and Royal </p><p>Jordanian is trying to fly as many of its regular flights as </p><p>possible, including direct service to the United States. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Swift action on the OFF readjustments to allow the </p><p>UN to certify delivery of OFF goods in Jordan rather than in </p><p>Iraq would also help minimize the impact of the conflict on </p><p>those banks involved in OFF trade. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  On Sunday, the Ambassador and Finance Minister </p><p>will the bilateral debt rescheduling agreement.  This will </p><p>give the Ambassador an excellent platform to highlight US </p><p>assistance to Jordan and the investment the US has made in </p><p>the bilateral economic relationship.  This should provide </p><p>another element of reassurance for economic actors, who </p><p>generally expect the US to provide extraordinary assistance </p><p>to help Jordan weather the initial impact of a conflict. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
