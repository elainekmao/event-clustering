<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002787 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/21/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  FM MUDENGE LECTURES THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA RICHARD ROTH FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: IN AN EXCRUCIATING TWO- </p><p>HOUR LECTURE TO THE FULL DIPLOMATIC CORPS SEPTEMBER 20 </p><p>ZIMBABWE FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE EXTOLLED THE GREAT </p><p>SUCCESS OF THE ABUJA AGREEMENT BECAUSE "EVERYONE </p><p>AGREED ON THE CENTRALITY OF THE LAND ISSUE", PRAISED </p><p>THE SADC HEADS OF STATE MEETING (SEPTEMBER 10-11) </p><p>BECAUSE THEY AFFIRMED THE ABUJA AGREEMENT ON LAND </p><p>REFORM, AND LAID DOWN A MARKER ON THE NEED FOR FOREIGN </p><p>GOVERNMENTS TO "HONOR AND RESPECT" ZIMBABWE\'S LAW </p><p>PROHIBITING THE FOREIGN FINANCING OF POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES.  HE ALSO DEVOTED A PORTION OF HIS </p><p>PRESENTATION ON THE RECENT KIGALI POLITICAL COMMITTEE </p><p>MEETING ON THE DRC (SEE SEPTEL).  WHILE TRYING TO </p><p>REMAIN WITHIN HIS ROLE AS FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE </p><p>FREQUENTLY DONNED HIS FAR MORE PARTISAN HAT AS A ZANU- </p><p>PF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT (MP), CONVENIENTLY SWEEPING </p><p>ASIDE THE OTHER SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS OF THE ABUJA AND </p><p>SADC MEETINGS ON RULE OF LAW, CESSATION OF </p><p>INTIMIDATION AND GOVERNMENT-CONDONED VIOLENCE.  IT </p><p>WILL BE VERY HARD TO LEVEL THIS PLAYING FIELD IF </p><p>MUDENGE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE POLICY INTENTIONS OF </p><p>MUGABE AND HIS INNER CIRCLE, WHICH WE BELIEVE HE DOES. </p><p>END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ABUJA:  LAND, LAND, LAND </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN DESCRIBING THE SEPTEMBER 6 ABUJA MEETING, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02787  01 OF 02  211042Z </p><p>MUDENGE SAID THAT INITIALLY IT WAS HEADED FOR A </p><p>DISASTER BECAUSE OF THE TOTALLY INCOMPATIBLE </p><p>PERSPECTIVES OF THE GOZ WITH THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS. </p><p>IN HIS VIEW, IT WAS THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF NIGERIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT OBASANJO THAT THE MEETING WAS "SAVED" </p><p>BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO "DOWNPLAY" THE OTHER </p><p>"EXTRANEOUS" ISSUES THAT THE OTHER DELEGATES WANTED TO </p><p>DISCUSS AND PLACE THE FOCUS ON THE LAND REFORM </p><p>QUESTION.  MUDENGE CLAIMED THAT THE OTHER DELEGATES </p><p>AGREED IN THE END TO THE "CENTRALITY" OF THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE, BUT EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT HOW IT WAS </p><p>BEING IMPLEMENTED.  HE MENTIONED RULE OF LAW, VIOLENCE </p><p>AND THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AS BEING THE PRINCIPLE </p><p>CONCERNS OF THE OTHER DELEGATES.  IN THE END THE </p><p>COMPROMISE WAS ACCEPTED OUTLINING THE PRINCIPLES OF </p><p>WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A "PACKAGE DEAL" WITH THE </p><p>COMMITMENTS OF EACH PARTY CLEARLY DEFINED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MUDENGE ASSERTED THAT THE GOZ INTENDS TO HONOR </p><p>THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER OF THE ABUJA AGREEMENT, BUT </p><p>WILL DO SO IN A VERY DELIBERATE FASHION.  HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD CONDUCTED A 12- </p><p>HOUR INTERNAL MEETING OF THE POLITBURO TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF ABUJA AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ACCUSED BY SOME </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBERS OF SELLING OUT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>GOZ WILL PUT IN PLACE A MECHANISM TO IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>ABUJA AGREEMENT NEXT WEEK.  HE FRANKLY ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THERE HAVE BEEN INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE UP UNTIL </p><p>NOW, BUT ASCRIBED THIS TO THE FACT THAT THERE HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN AN IMPLEMENTING MECHANISM IN PLACE.  HE STATED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02787  01 OF 02  211042Z </p><p>FLATLY THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ZANU-PF WILL GREATLY </p><p>REDUCE VIOLENT INCIDENTS AND BRING ABOUT A RETURN TO </p><p>NORMALCY.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE GOZ WILL STOP ANY NEW </p><p>OCCUPATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MUDENGE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>NOT YET HAD A SERIOUS MEETING WITH THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS, SOME OF WHOM BELIEVE THERE WILL BE "FULL </p><p>COMPENSATION" FOR THEIR LAND.  BUT, HE CLAIMED, MANY </p><p>WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT FROM THIS BECAUSE THE ISSUE IS </p><p>NOT MONEY, BUT LAND, AND MANY COMMERCIAL FARMERS WILL </p><p>TRY TO ENSURE THAT ABUJA WILL NOT SUCCEED.  "WE INTEND </p><p>TO FULFILL OUR COMMITMENTS AND WE HOPE THAT THE UK, </p><p>AUSTRALIA AND CANADA WILL FULFILL THEIRS".  HE ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT OTHERS WOULD ASSOCIATE </p><p>THEMSELVES WITH THIS COMMITMENT, I.E. BE PREPARED TO </p><p>CONTRIBUTE MONEY FOR LAND REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>SADC:  WE\'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUDENGE\'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SADC MEETING ALSO </p><p>EXCLUDED VIRTUALLY EVERY SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE EXCEPT </p><p>LAND.  HE ATTEMPTED TO SPIN THE MEETING AS ONE IN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3686 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02787  02 OF 02  211042Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------22B247  211042Z /38 </p><p>O 211022Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9787 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002787 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/21/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  FM MUDENGE LECTURES THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p> </p><p>WHICH "EVERYONE" HAD AGREED THAT LAND WAS THE CENTRAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02787  02 OF 02  211042Z </p><p>ISSUE.  HE ALSO TRIED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC WELFARE AFFECTED THE WELFARE OF THE REST OF </p><p>THE REGION AND THAT WAS EXACTLY WHY SANCTIONS WOULD </p><p>HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR ZIMBABWE\'S SADC </p><p>NEIGHBORS.  "VILIFYING AND DEMONIZING ZIMBABWE HAS A </p><p>NEGATIVE ON THE WHOLE REGION AND DISCOURAGES ECONOMIC </p><p>ACTIVITY".  MUDENGE THEN DRONED ON ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>INTER-DEPENDENT ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA, </p><p>BOTSWANA AND MOZAMBIQUE.  ONLY TOWARD THE END DID HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE SADC\'S CONCERN ABOUT THE "PERCEPTION OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND RANDOM INTIMIDATION", BUT TRIED TO </p><p>DISMISS THIS AS "MANUFACTURED PROPAGANDA". </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>STAY OUT OF OUR POLITICS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AFTER AN IMPASSIONED PLEA FOR UN SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL PERM-5 MEMBERS TO URGE THEIR CAPITOLS TO </p><p>SUPPORT AN INSERTION OF A LARGE UN PEACEKEEPING FORCE </p><p>IN THE DRC TO REPLACE THE SMALL UN OBSERVER FORCE, </p><p>MUDENGE ADDED AN UNANNOUNCED ITEM TO HIS AGENDA. </p><p>TELLING THE ASSEMBLED DIP CORPS THAT HE WAS APPEALING </p><p>TO THEM AS A MINISTER AND NOT AS A ZANU-PF MP, HE </p><p>LAUNCHED INTO A NONE TOO THINLY VEILED WARNING THAT </p><p>THEIR GOVERNMENTS MUST "HONOR AND RESPECT" THE </p><p>RECENTLY PASSED GOZ LAW PROHIBITING THE FOREIGN </p><p>FINANCING OF POLITICAL PARTIES.  HE SAID BLUNTLY THAT </p><p>THIS WOULD MEAN THAT DIRECT FOREIGN SUPPORT OF THE MDC </p><p>IS FORBIDDEN.  AS FOREIGN MINISTER HE HOPED THAT </p><p>ACCREDITED GOVERNMENTS WOULD SEE ADHERENCE TO THIS LAW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02787  02 OF 02  211042Z </p><p>IN THE CONTEXT OF GOOD RELATIONS.  TO STRENGTHEN HIS </p><p>POINT MUDENGE CLAIMED THAT THE GOZ HAD "COPIED FROM </p><p>SOME OF YOUR LAWS" IN WRITING ITS OWN SIMILAR </p><p>LEGISLATION.  "THIS LAW IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY, INDEPENDENCE AND SELF-RESPECT.  LET US </p><p>MAKE OUR OWN MISTAKES ACCORDING TO OUR NATIONAL </p><p>CHARACTER.  WE HAVE OUR OWN POLITICAL CULTURE, PLEASE </p><p>LET US FOLLOW IT ON OUR OWN." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SHEDDING HIS MINISTERIAL CLOAK, MUDENGE </p><p>INFORMED THE AUDIENCE THAT ZANU-PF INTENDS TO FIGHT </p><p>VERY STRONGLY AGAINST EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE.  AS </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER HE HOPED THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO </p><p>CALL IN ANY OF THE AMBASSADORS OR CHARGES TO CONFRONT </p><p>THEM WITH VIOLATIONS BY THEIR GOVERNMENTS OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LAWS.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED, HE WOULD NOT </p><p>HESITATE TO DO SO IF THE GOZ\'S INFORMATION WAS </p><p>SUFFICIENT TO "PROVE" THAT FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WERE </p><p>BREAKING THE GOZ\'S LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>ADDITIONAL COMMENT: </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) AS ONE OF THE HARDLINERS WITHIN THE GOZ AND </p><p>ZANU-PF, MUDENGE GAVE A VERY FRANK OUTLINE OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S STRATEGY: PORTRAY RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AS </p><p>SUPPORTING THE GOZ\'S POLICIES ON LAND REFORM, DOWNPLAY </p><p>ANY EFFORTS TO FOCUS ON RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION ISSUES, AND CAST THE UPCOMING ELECTION AS </p><p>A "VICTORY" FOR ZANU-PF IN FINALLY GETTING BACK THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02787  02 OF 02  211042Z </p><p>LAND FOR THE MAJORITY OF ZIMBABWE\'S CITIZENS.  A </p><p>BACKGROUND THEME WILL BE TO BLAME ANY LACK OF SUCCESS </p><p>ON EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE AND TO TRY AND LIMIT ANY </p><p>SUPPORT TO THE MDC TO THE BAREST MINIMUM.  IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF THIS MEETING THERE WASN\'T EVEN A HINT AT </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF ELECTION MONITORS/OBSERVERS OR </p><p>PARTICIPATION BY EXTERNAL ACTORS.  GIVEN MUDENGE\'S </p><p>MARKER ON ASSISTANCE TO POLITICAL PARTIES, WE STRONGLY </p><p>BELIEVE THAT GETTING INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL PROGRAMS IN </p><p>HERE WILL BE A VERY TOUGH CHALLENGE AND HIGHLY </p><p>UNWELCOMED BY THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
