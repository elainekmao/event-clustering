(C) SUMMARY: UNHCR OFFICIALS ADU AND SALOMONS </p><p>CONTINUED IN THEIR QUEST TO SECURE THE RELEASE OF THE </p><p>CUBAN DOCTORS JUNE 12, AT ONE POINT TELLING THE INS </p><p>OFFICER TO LEAVE THEM TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY.  THEY HAD </p><p>NO OBJECTION TO EMBOFFS SEEING THE CUBANS BUT SAID THEY </p><p>WOULD NOT HELP THEM GAIN ACCESS.  AT THE SAME TIME </p><p>SALOMONS PROBED FOR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ON WHAT THE </p><p>DOCTORS TOLD INS OFFICER VARSANI ABOUT THEIR REFOULEMENT </p><p>ORDEAL. THE UNHCR OFFICIALS TOLD US THAT THE DECISION TO </p><p>RELEASE THE CUBANS NOW RESTED WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, AND </p><p>THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS WERE ASKING THAT THE CUBAN </p><p>DEFECTORS BE RESETTLED IN A COUNTRY OTHER THAN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES, AS HAD BEEN THE PRACTICE IN SUCH CASES IN </p><p>THE PAST.  REGIONAL UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE BAJULAIYE MAY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03160  01 OF 02  121733Z </p><p>COME TO HARARE TO TAKE OVER THE CASE, BUT DOWNPLAYS HIS </p><p>CHANCES OF ACHIEVING SUCCESS.  MEANWHILE, SENIOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUED TO OUCK THE AMBASSAOOR\'S </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THEM, OR FEIGNEO IGNORANCE OF THE </p><p>MERITS OF THE CASE WHEN REACHED.  IF WE SEE NO PROGRESS </p><p>IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, POST ASKS THAT THE SECRETARY </p><p>REQUEST UNHCR HEAD OGATA TO INTERVENE WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE TO SECURE THE CUBANS\' RELEASE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON JUNE 12 UNHCR REPRESENTATIVES ADU AND SALOMONS </p><p>ADVISED INS OFFICER SANJEETA VARSANI THAT HER PRESENCE </p><p>WOULD BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO ANY MEETINGS HELD WITH GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS CONCERNING THE CUBANS AND WOULD HINDER UNHCR\'S </p><p>IMPARTIALITY.  SALOMONS, HOWEVER, ASKED VARSANI TO SHARE </p><p>INS INTERVIEW NOTES FROM THE JUNE 9 REFUGEE INTERVIEW </p><p>THAT SHE CONDUCTED WITH THE CUBANS, AS THIS INFORMATION </p><p>WOULD BE HELPFUL TO UNHCR IN THE MEETINGS WITH THE GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS.  SALOMONS ALSO STATED THAT HE SPECIFICALLY </p><p>WANTED INFORMATION REGARDING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CUBANS </p><p>AFTER THEY WERE ABDUCTED FROM THE TEACHER\'S HOME ON JUNE </p><p>2 AND WHAT SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIALS DID OR SAID WHEN THE </p><p>CUBANS ARRIVED IN JOHANNESBURG.  SALOMONS INDICATED THAT </p><p>IF UNHCR COULD ESTABLISH THAT SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIALS </p><p>ASSISTED THE GOZ IN THE ATTEMPTED REFOULEMENT OF THE </p><p>CUBANS, THEN UNHCR STOOD A BETTER CHANCE AT SECURING THE </p><p>CUBANS\' RELEASE INTO THEIR CUSTODY TODAY JUNE 12. </p><p>VARSANI DEMURRED AND SAID THAT SHE COULD NOT SHARE ANY </p><p>INFORMATION WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF HER INS SUPERIORS. </p><p>SALOMONS WENT ON TO STATE THAT THE PROCESS OF GETTING </p><p>THE CUBANS RELEASED MAY TAKE SEVERAL DAYS, AS THE FINAL </p><p>DECISION RESTED WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE.  HE ALSO ADDED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03160  01 OF 02  121733Z </p><p>THAT IN THE PAST, WHEN HIGH PROFILE CUBANS DEFECT, CUBA </p><p>TRIES TO SAVE FACE BY HAVING THEM RESETTLED IN ANY </p><p>COUNTRY EXCEPT THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CONSUL RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM FORWARD </p><p>MADZIYA (STRICTLY PROTECT), THE TEACHER WITH WHOM THE </p><p>CUBANS HAD BEEN STAYING AFTER THEY REQUESTED ASYLUM. </p><p>VARSANI WENT TO VISIT MADZIYA AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HE </p><p>TEACHES IN GLEN NORAH, A HIGH-DENSITY AREA OUTSIDE OF </p><p>HARARE.  AFTER CONFIRMING THAT VARSANI HAD THE CUBANS\' </p><p>BEST INTERESTS IN MIND AND THAT SHE KNEW WHERE CORDOVA </p><p>HAD HIDDEN THEIR PASSPORTS, MADZIYA TOOK VARSANI TO HIS </p><p>HOME AND HANDED OVER THEIR PASSPORTS, TELEPHONE DIARIES, </p><p>AND OTHER PERSONAL DOCUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ADU AND SALOMONS CONTINUE TO ARGUE THAT THE USG </p><p>SHOULD KEEP ITS DISTANCE FROM THE CASE AND ALLOW THE </p><p>CUBANS TO BE RESETTLED IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY, AS A </p><p>"FACE-SAVING MEASURE" FOR THE GOZ.  SALOMONS ALSO TOLD </p><p>VARSANI THAT IF SHE ANO CONSUL WISHED TO VISIT THE </p><p>CUBANS, THAT PERMISSION WOULO HAVE TO BE SECURED WITHOUT </p><p>UNHCR ASSISTANCE.
