<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000860 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AFRICAN PRESIDENTIAL MEDIATION IMPORTANT - BUT NO </p><p>QUICK-FIX </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 843 </p><p>     B. HARARE 780 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The presidents of South Africa, Nigeria and Malawi </p><p>attempted to restart talks between the GOZ and MDC in </p><p>separate meetings with both sides in Harare on May 5. </p><p>However, both sides stuck to their original positions - </p><p>Mugabe demanding that the MDC recognize his presidency, and </p><p>the MDC refusing any preconditions to talks - essentially </p><p>precluding the dialogue for now.  While not yet particularly </p><p>fruitful, this effort should not be discounted since it </p><p>signals increasing African frustration with the threat of a </p><p>Zimbabwean meltdown and could produce important pressure on </p><p>the Mugabe regime if it is sustained.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Bakili Muluzi </p><p>of Malawi and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria met with President </p><p>Mugabe in Harare on May 5 in a mediation effort to discuss </p><p>the resumption of talks with the MDC.  The delegation also </p><p>met MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai, MDC Secretary General </p><p>Welshman Ncube, MDC Deputy Secretary General Gift </p><p>Chimanikire, and MDC special assistant to the president Gandi </p><p>Mudzingwa in a separate meeting. </p><p> </p><p>Muluzi Sympathetic, Mbeki\'s Sentiments Improving </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The delegation met first with Mugabe and later with </p><p>MDC officials.  Mudzingwa reported that both sides </p><p>essentially stuck to their original positions, i.e. Mugabe </p><p>demanded that the MDC drop its court challenge of the March </p><p>2002 presidential election and recognize his legitimacy; and </p><p>the MDC maintained they would do no such thing and would </p><p>enter talks only with no preconditions.  Mudzingwa reported </p><p>that Muluzi was sympathetic to the MDC\'s position that they </p><p>had a constitutional right to bring a dispute to court. </p><p>While Mbeki spoke in very roundabout terms, he ultimately </p><p>seemed frustrated and acknowledged that the essential crisis </p><p>was of governance and nothing else.  Mudzingwa noted that </p><p>Mbeki seemed more sympathetic to the MDC than on previous </p><p>occasions and could possibly be convinced further. </p><p> </p><p>De Facto Recognition? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ncube explained the rationale behind the MDC\'s court </p><p>challenge, as a constitutional right, as a matter of </p><p>principle, and as a bargaining chip.  Ncube also acknowledged </p><p>that Mugabe was the de facto president, that he was sworn-in, </p><p>and was performing the functions of president, but that the </p><p>MDC had the right to challenge his de jure credentials. </p><p>Mbeki seized on this as a potential MDC "recognition" or </p><p>"acknowledgment" of Mugabe\'s presidency, but the MDC </p><p>officials were loathe to have these statements construed as </p><p>recognition of Mugabe\'s presidency.  They strongly disagree </p><p>with any preconditions to resuming talks, do not want to </p><p>engage in any capitulation, and believe that Mugabe\'s demand </p><p>is a smokescreen designed to obstruct talks and in the end </p><p>ensure his and his party\'s political future rather than a </p><p>resolution to Zimbabwe\'s political crisis.  The MDC officials </p><p>feel strongly about the principles they stand for and are not </p><p>willing to jeopardize those, and potentially Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>future, by rushing into talks with Mugabe, who they perceive </p><p>to be insincere.  The MDC officials believe the political </p><p>tide is turning in their direction and they have no reason to </p><p>capitulate now. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Upon departure, President Obasanjo gave the press an </p><p>artfully constructed formulation about mutual recognition </p><p>that the election was conducted according to the </p><p>constitution.  Government media claimed that the MDC had </p><p>recognized Mugabe\'s legitimacy.  We do not yet have an inside </p><p>GOZ read on the talks. </p><p> </p><p>Tsvangirai to Go to Malawi </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) As a follow-up, Muluzi has invited Tsvangirai to </p><p>Blantyre for further consultations.  According to Mudzingwa, </p><p>even though Tsvangirai\'s passport was confiscated pending the </p><p>outcome of the treason trial against him, Mugabe has agreed </p><p>to allow Tsvangirai to travel to Malawi for this purpose. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>7. (C) Two successful stayaways in as many months, and two </p><p>March by-election wins have bolstered the MDC\'s confidence </p><p>that the political tide is moving in their direction.  The </p><p>same stayaways, as well as African leaders\' increasing </p><p>frustration with Zimbabwe\'s economic crisis and political </p><p>violence appear to be putting succession strategizing near </p><p>the forefront of Mugabe\'s thinking.  Unfortunately, neither </p><p>side has yet been willing to make any significant concessions </p><p>to ensure that talks begin.  Mugabe in particular seems </p><p>unwilling to publicly admit recent political setbacks, and </p><p>the MDC correctly feels it would gain no advantage by </p><p>capitulating to Mugabe\'s preconditions (especially with </p><p>another mass action of indefinite duration to begin May 13). </p><p>While not yet particularly fruitful, this effort should not </p><p>be discounted since it signals increasing African frustration </p><p>with the threat of a Zimbabwean meltdown and could produce </p><p>important pressure on the Mugabe regime if it is sustained. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
