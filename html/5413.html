President Bush\'s State of the Union Address received </p><p>      good placement in both the print and electronic </p><p>      media (radio).  All four state-run radio channels - </p><p>      3FM, SpotFM, FM Zimbabwe, and Radio Zimbabwe - </p><p>      carried excerpts of the Presidents speech starting </p><p>      with the 1700 news programs broadcast on January 29. </p><p>      Segments focused on the President\'s new HIV/AIDS </p><p>      initiative and policy toward Iraq were also </p><p>      broadcast on FM Zimbabwe, a channel that broadcasts </p><p>      in 14 vernacular languages.  The story also </p><p>      dominated the main news programs broadcast in </p><p>      English at 1800 and 2000 on January 29 on 3FM and </p><p>      SpotFM.  Radio Zimbabwe (audience estimated at two </p><p>      million) also aired the same news program at 1800 </p><p>      and 2000 hours using the two predominant local </p><p>      languages of Shona and Ndebele.  A combined </p><p>      listenership of nearly five million people heard the </p><p>      radio news programs on all four channels. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   All January 30 carried wire reports on the SOTU </p><p>      address.  The independent daily "The Daily News" carried a </p><p>      Reuters article on page 7 under headline "Bush seeks $825 </p><p>      billion to fight Aids in Africa."  The government- </p><p>      controlled daily "The Herald" also picked up a Reuters </p><p>      article about the President\'s message on Iraq.  The paper </p><p>      published the article on page 2 under headline "Bush vows </p><p>      to use full force against Baghdad: Washington told to use </p><p>      caution." Another government-controlled daily "Chronicle," </p><p>      published in Bulawayo, used the same Reuters story, but </p><p>      carried it under the headline "Bush asks UN to hear fresh </p><p>      Iraq evidence."  Under headline "Bush seeks US$15 bln to </p><p>      fight AIDS in Africa" the independent weekly "The Financial </p><p>      Gazette" carried another Reuters wire article on page 30. </p><p>      The pro-government daily "The Daily Mirror" carried an </p><p>      article by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on </p><p>      page 17 under headline "Shares plunge after Bush speech." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
