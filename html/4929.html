<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000012 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  PDP GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA TIMOTHY D. ANDREWS.  REASONS: 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) The People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) held its so- </p><p>called primaries during Christmas week 2002, producing few </p><p>surprises.  The selection of delegates to the state-by- </p><p>state caucuses was designed to give maximum authority to </p><p>incumbent governors in controlling the selection process. </p><p>As expected, the majority of incumbents faced only token </p><p>opposition in securing renomination.  Questions remain </p><p>about the validity of several of the caucuses, however, due </p><p>to ongoing controversy.  Often-conflicting reports sourced </p><p>to different party officials indicate that the caucuses in </p><p>at least two, and possibly as many as ten, of the 36 states </p><p>may have been suspended or annulled.  Further, the final </p><p>nomination of candidates requires the National Executive </p><p>Council (under party Chairman Audu Ogbeh) to certify the </p><p>state-by-state results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Ogbeh told the press on December 30, 2002, that the </p><p>incumbent governors would "ordinarily not have been made to </p><p>go through the rigor of primaries but for the need to </p><p>address the fears of some members that candidates would be </p><p>imposed on the party."  He then presented 20 of the 21 PDP </p><p>incumbent governors with nomination certificates.  Anambra </p><p>Governor Mbadinaju may have been the exception, though some </p><p>reports say he ultimately got his certificate also. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In spite of Ogbeh\'s soothing words about the </p><p>"primary process," many irregularities arose.  The party </p><p>has made no definitive statement on the validity of the </p><p>various state primaries and party officials have given </p><p>conflicting statements on the conduct of primaries in the </p><p>remaining states.  In many instances, the reported vote </p><p>tally requires observers to suspend belief.  In one state, </p><p>for example, the incumbent won 100 percent of the votes, </p><p>indicating that his two opponents, realizing their own </p><p>limitations, voted against themselves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In another instance, the Election Returns Officer </p><p>from Delta State showed the primary tally sheets to PolOff </p><p>on January 1, commenting that he did not know what he </p><p>should do with them.  He said that, before the "primary," </p><p>President Obasanjo had advised him to ensure the victory of </p><p>a specific senatorial candidate.  Shortly after his </p><p>conversation with the President, the Vice-President had </p><p>called on behalf of a second candidate and former Minister </p><p>of Works and Obasanjo\'s Rasputin Tony Anenih lobbied for a </p><p>third candidate.  Further, the Returns Officer said, before </p><p>he could tally the results, the outcome was announced by </p><p>the Presidency in Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Even though Kano Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso received </p><p>the nomination certificate at the PDP\'s December 30, 2002, </p><p>ceremony, the outcome of the Kano caucus is controversial. </p><p>Some reports say that the caucuses were suspended due to </p><p>irregularities while others announced "official" results. </p><p>In either case the machinations in Kano highlight the </p><p>difficulty of maintaining 100 percent control over the </p><p>selections.  Kwankwaso, an Obasanjo supporter, was </p><p>successful in his quest for securing the gubernatorial </p><p>nomination, winning a reported 284 of 287 votes after his </p><p>strongest opponent (Umar Danhassan) walked out in the wake </p><p>of denial of accreditation to many supporters.  Meanwhile, </p><p>incumbent Speaker of the House and Obasanjo gadfly Ghali </p><p>Na\'Abba secured the party\'s nomination for his reelection </p><p>bid.  According to one attendee, Na\'Abba garnered all the </p><p>votes in the first round, but the Returns Officer announced </p><p>his defeat at the hands of a rival, the son of former Head </p><p>of State Murtala Mohammed and the handpicked candidate of </p><p>President Obasanjo.  After rallying his supporters and </p><p>staging a series of public demonstrations which threatened </p><p>to close down the convention, a second vote was conducted, </p><p>reportedly on instructions from the President, and Na\'Abba </p><p>again chalked up a victory.  Kano observers commented that </p><p>the choice of Murtala\'s son was a poor one since the man </p><p>spoke virtually no Hausa (he grew up in the Southwest and </p><p>is far more fluent in Yoruba) and therefore could not have </p><p>understood most of his "constituents." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ogbeh commented to us that the candidate lists </p><p>would not be final until they are submitted to INEC on </p><p>February 25; until then, the process of vetting would </p><p>continue, and any candidate might be removed at any time. </p><p>Ogbeh also told us that the National Executive Council </p><p>would disqualify those who violate the principles of fair </p><p>play, stressing particularly the importance of eschewing </p><p>violence.  While disqualification remains a possible threat </p><p>for some, irregularities apparently were so widespread and </p><p>pervasive that the vast majority of PDP candidates who </p><p>emerged from the "primaries" ultimately will contest the </p><p>general election for the offices they seek.  No matter what </p><p>Ogbeh\'s philosophical inclinations or personal intentions </p><p>might be, he simply cannot disqualify every offender.  In </p><p>the end, only a few of the most egregious may face loss of </p><p>their PDP nominations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  The nomination process for the PDP was </p><p>transparent(ly contrived and occasionally ludicrous) and </p><p>generally far from free and fair.  The delegate lists were </p><p>manipulated to ensure that incumbent governors faced no </p><p>credible challenges.  Returns frequently were inaccurate or </p><p>delayed, occasionally outrightly fraudulent and, finally, </p><p>irrelevant to the announced results.  Losing aspirants may </p><p>now migrate to other parties, but whether they will fare </p><p>better in the general elections is uncertain. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
