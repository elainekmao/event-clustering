<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001075 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  06-18-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, SOCI, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  In visit to central region, some interlocutors </p><p>anxious over peace track, but Buddhist monks are serene </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1061, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Joseph L. Novak, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In a June 15-16 visit, Kandy, an </p><p>important city in Sri Lanka\'s Sinhalese belt, was quiet </p><p>and peaceful.  Many interlocutors, however, expressed </p><p>anxiety about Tamil Tiger intentions.  Buddhist monks, </p><p>an influential group, were more serene.  There was much </p><p>comment -- in a favorable way -- on what was perceived </p><p>as the USG\'s increased involvement in the peace track. </p><p>Similar to most Sri Lankans, Kandyans clearly value the </p><p>peace track, with no one wanting a return to war.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p>Visit to Kandy </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Poloff and Pol FSN visited Kandy on June 15-16. </p><p>Kandy, the most important city in central Sri Lanka, </p><p>appeared largely quiet and peaceful.  Markets were </p><p>crowded, with commercial activity seemingly booming.  In </p><p>what is Sri Lanka\'s most important Buddhist religious </p><p>center and a major city for the majority Sinhalese </p><p>ethnic group, Kandy\'s large population of saffron-clad </p><p>Buddhist monks went about their business.  Adjacent to </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s mountainous tea growing region, Kandy\'s </p><p>climate was also less oppressive than Colombo\'s, due to </p><p>its higher elevation and steep, foliage-covered, emerald </p><p>green hills. </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p>Anxiety about the Peace Track </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The refreshing change of climate did not extend </p><p>to the political scene, however, as local politicians, </p><p>university professors, and think-tank scholars all </p><p>expressed anxiety about the current state of the peace </p><p>process.  In particular, interlocutors expressed deep </p><p>concerns about the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) and its depth of commitment to the peace track. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In a meeting with Opposition People\'s Alliance </p><p>(PA) politicians, for example, senior PA MP Dr. Sarath </p><p>Amunugama expressed deep worry about the fate of the </p><p>peace process given the recent sinking of what he </p><p>characterized as a LTTE "arms resupply" ship. </p><p>(Note:  Amunugama also serves as chief PA spokesman. </p><p>His reference was to the June 14 sinking of a LTTE ship </p><p>which was intercepted by the Sri Lankan navy off the </p><p>northeast coast.  Despite his claims, it has not been </p><p>determined whether the ship was carrying arms-related </p><p>items -- see Reftels.)  Amunugama went on to tell poloff </p><p>that the Tigers\' hard-line demand for immediate creation </p><p>of an interim structure in the north/east was grating to </p><p>many in the south, as was its failure to turn up for the </p><p>recent Tokyo donors conference.  In making its demands, </p><p>Amunugama said he thought the LTTE was mainly trying to </p><p>mobilize support among Tamils in the north/east. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The PA politicians were not alone in their </p><p>criticism of the Tigers.  Open distrust of the group was </p><p>also echoed by Kesara Senanayake, the mayor of Kandy, </p><p>and Dr. K.M. de Silva, head of the independent </p><p>International Center for Ethnic Studies (ICES). </p><p>(Note:  Senanayake is a relative of two past prime </p><p>ministers and is a member of the governing United </p><p>National Party (UNP); de Silva, is a well-known </p><p>historian with loose UNP connections.)  Professor de </p><p>Silva said he thought that members of Sri Lanka\'s Tamil </p><p>community outside of the LTTE-controlled areas in the </p><p>north/east were very frustrated with the LTTE\'s failure </p><p>to reform and become more pluralistic.  He added that </p><p>many Tamils were also frightened about the wave of </p><p>recent assassinations of Tamil opponents, which were </p><p>almost certainly being perpetrated by the LTTE (see </p><p>Reftels).  Senanayake, in ominous tones, claimed that </p><p>the Tigers had operatives stationed in Kandy who were </p><p>prepared to take action should the Tigers return to war. </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p>Monks more Serene </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Compared to the politicians and poloff\'s other </p><p>interlocutors, Buddhist monks were considerably more </p><p>serene about the peace process.  (Note:  Monks are a </p><p>very influential group in Sri Lanka, which is almost 70 </p><p>percent Buddhist.  In addition to religious and societal </p><p>affairs, monks often comment on political issues, too.) </p><p>The deputy Mahanayakes (revered leaders) of the Buddhist </p><p>Asgiriya and Malwatte sects (the two largest monastic </p><p>groups in Sri Lanka) did not criticize the LTTE. </p><p>Instead, Menikdiwela Sri Rathanasara Thero of the </p><p>Malwatte sect and Niranjan D. Wijerathna, the Chief </p><p>Custodian (highest lay person) of the Tooth Relic </p><p>Temple, spent much time highlighting the positive </p><p>results of the peace process.  Both made a point to show </p><p>poloff the temple areas destroyed and rebuilt since the </p><p>January 1998 bombing of the area by the LTTE. </p><p>(Note:  Thirteen people were killed in the incident. </p><p>The attack shocked the country as the temple is the most </p><p>venerated site in Sri Lankan Buddhism.)  In doing so, </p><p>however, they did not cast aspersions on Tamils or the </p><p>LTTE, but stressed the futility of the war and of </p><p>terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p>Perceived increase in USG Interest </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In discussions with poloff, many interlocutors </p><p>placed a spotlight on what they perceived as an increase </p><p>in USG interest in Sri Lanka and the peace process.  In </p><p>making this claim, the general view was that U.S. </p><p>involvement was a positive thing, which should continue. </p><p>Dr. P.O. Thattil, for example, a U.S.-educated </p><p>researcher at the University of Peridiniya which is near </p><p>Kandy, said he thought heightened U.S. support for the </p><p>peace process was a positive development, which put </p><p>pressure on the LTTE.  He wondered whether U.S. </p><p>involvement came somewhat at the expense of Norway. </p><p>(Note:  The Norwegian government has been serving as </p><p>facilitator for the peace process for the past handful </p><p>of years.)  PA spokesman Amunugama, who also thought </p><p>that the U.S. was more involved in Sri Lanka than in the </p><p>past, asked whether U.S.-India discussions included Sri </p><p>Lanka and whether the U.S. would back the GSL should war </p><p>return.  Mayor Senanayake joked that General Franks </p><p>could deal with the Tigers in half a day if the Tigers </p><p>abandoned the 18-month-old ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In response, poloff emphasized that the U.S. and </p><p>the rest of the international community wanted to do all </p><p>they could to assist Sri Lanka\'s peace process.  This </p><p>had been made clear at the recent Tokyo donors </p><p>conference.  From the very start of the war, however, </p><p>the international community had recognized that it would </p><p>be best for Sri Lanka and the region if the conflict was </p><p>ended via a negotiated settlement.  That said, it was up </p><p>to Sri Lankans to make peace happen, not outsiders. </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>=-=-=-= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Similar to most Sri Lankans, Kandyans of all </p><p>sorts clearly value the peace process on a very deep </p><p>level.  Even in light of the generally high degree of </p><p>anxiety over Tiger intentions, no one that poloff spoke </p><p>to wanted a return to war. </p><p>10.  (C) The reaction of Buddhist monks, for example, </p><p>was very interesting.  Despite their reputation as being </p><p>zealots on the issue of Sinhalese Buddhist rights in Sri </p><p>Lanka, the monks made clear that they wanted peace and </p><p>supported the GSL\'s efforts.  In fact, they seemed to </p><p>bend over backwards not to criticize the Tigers or the </p><p>Tamil community in any way.  The import of this is that </p><p>it is doubtful that Sinhalese chauvinists could ever </p><p>lead an effort to unseat the peace track without support </p><p>of the monks.  All that said, while the monks remain </p><p>serene, there are clearly growing worries developing </p><p>about the peace process in Sri Lanka\'s Sinhalese </p><p>heartland.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>NOVAK </p><p></p></div>
