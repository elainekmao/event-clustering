A survey of 500 </p><p>businessmen conducted by the economic daily "Dunya" shows </p><p>that 40 percent wanted Gul as Prime Minister.  Erdogan is </p><p>expected to present President Sezer with a list of five </p><p>candidates tomorrow.  Papers quote AKP sources as claiming </p><p>that the new Prime Minister would only stay in office for 60 </p><p>days, as the ban on Erdogan will be removed in January 2003. </p><p>Some reports claim Erdogan will consider party balances by </p><p>including in the cabinet a mixture of Islamist figures and </p><p>names close to center-right.  An AKP delegation led by </p><p>Erdogan will tour European capitals to lobby for Turkey\'s EU </p><p>drive, reports note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets: Papers report interest rates drop by 10 points, </p><p>accompanied by a record increase in stock markets.  Dailies </p><p>speculate that AKP will receive a genuine vote of confidence </p><p>from the markets when AKP works out a compromise with the </p><p>IMF in the fourth review work and the 2003 budget, and </p><p>achieves a breakthrough in talks with the EU.  Ali Coskun, </p><p>the AKP official responsible for the economy, said that the </p><p>IMF wants an end to `financial year zero\' implementation, </p><p>which Coskun sees as a controversial regulation that has </p><p>chased domestic money abroad.  Coskun added that in talks </p><p>with the IMF, AKP would put the emphasis on social aspects </p><p>of the program.  Tax rates will be reduced, and the state </p><p>will be restructured with authority on the economy under one </p><p>minister, Coskun said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Dailies expect the UN to present to Cypriots on the </p><p>island a new peace plan next week, and urge for a resolution </p><p>before the Copenhagen Summit in December.  "Hurriyet" claims </p><p>that President Bush is supporting the new initiative. </p><p>Thomas Weston is expected in Ankara this weekend.  Speaking </p><p>to a Greek TV channel, Erdogan said his party supported the </p><p>Belgian model for Cyprus.  Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou </p><p>said Greece favored the Belgian model as well, with Cyprus </p><p>having a united international representation with prevailing </p><p>EU resolutions.  "Cumhuriyet" characterized Erdogan\'s Cyprus </p><p>remarks as a `gaffe\' because he made reference to </p><p>`communities\' on the island instead of two separate </p><p>`states.\'  Outgoing Foreign Minister Gurel denounced </p><p>Erdogan\'s remarks as an `example of ignorance\' which came at </p><p>a time Turkey was striving for recognition of the Turkish </p><p>Cypriot state.  MFA has urgently decided to brief Erdogan on </p><p>foreign policy matters to prevent further gaffes, </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" notes.  Papers report Athens as welcoming </p><p>Erdogan replacing Ecevit, who was a hard-liner on Cyprus </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Pearson on polls, U.S.-Turkey ties: Dailies </p><p>report U.S. Ambassador to Ankara Robert Pearson voicing U.S. </p><p>support for the cabinet to be formed by AKP.  Appearing on </p><p>NTV on Tuesday, Ambassador Pearson congratulated AKP on its </p><p>election victory, and vowed continued U.S. backing for </p><p>Turkey\'s democratization effort, economic reforms and EU </p><p>drive.  Pearson said he expected no change in U.S.-Turkey </p><p>relations under the new AKP government.  He also emphasized </p><p>the U.S. expectation for strong Turkish support regarding </p><p>problems with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>General Ozkok in U.S.: Papers and broadcasters report that </p><p>TGS Chief General Ozkok was received at the highest level at </p><p>the Pentagon, State Department and the White House, and met </p><p>with Powell, Rice and Cheney.  "Hurriyet" says General Ozkok </p><p>eased concerns of the U.S. Administration by welcoming the </p><p>AKP election victory as an indication of the Turkish </p><p>nation\'s will, and assuring that Washington should not worry </p><p>about the new situation in Turkey.  Ozkok is also quoted as </p><p>saying that Turkey prefers a non-military solution to the </p><p>Iraqi problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Turkish Elections </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Closure of an era" </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (11/6): "The </p><p>great victory of the AKP, and its stance helped the Turkish </p><p>public opinion to forget about the past era.  We are </p><p>discussing about future easily now.  Yet shaping Turkey\'s </p><p>future requires a clear description and understanding the </p><p>past.  What we have just put behind us, with the result of </p><p>election, was the era of corruption economy, favoritism as </p><p>well as abusing economy for personal interests.  The Turkish </p><p>people has simply wiped out that during November 3 </p><p>elections." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Doesn\'t have to be like me; ruling the country decently is </p><p>enough" </p><p>Fatih Altayli comments in mass appeal Hurriyet (11/6): </p><p>"There are some pre-conceived ideas or judgements about the </p><p>AKP and its leader Erdogan.  Turkey should get rid of this </p><p>spirit particularly now as the country is going toward a new </p><p>era.  Otherwise, the members of the AKP will feel themselves </p><p>`different\' and `alienated\' while they are about to start </p><p>ruling the country. . What matters is that Turkey deserves </p><p>to have good rulers, not necessarily the people that I can </p><p>see parallel lifestyles with mine." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A good start" </p><p>Sami kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (11/6): "The </p><p>messages coming from Brussels show that the EU has opened a </p><p>`credit account\' for the AKP.  The EU is willing to </p><p>cooperate with the AKP government.  It clearly indicates </p><p>that remarks by Erdogan on Turkey\'s EU commitment were </p><p>encouraging enough for the EU.  Yet it is also clear that </p><p>the EU will wait a little while to see the actual </p><p>implementation of the obligations in Turkey.  That means the </p><p>upcoming Copenhagen summit will not give Turkey a clear and </p><p>precise date for the negotiations.  This has nothing to do </p><p>with the AKP government, because the same stance was the </p><p>fact for the previous government as well.  . If Turkey works </p><p>diligently, June 2003 might be a more realistic time to </p><p>expect a date from EU for negotiations." </p><p></p></div>
