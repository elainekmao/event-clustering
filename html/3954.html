<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005922 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, JO, AID </p><p>SUBJECT: DAS CHENEY MEETS WITH QUEEN RANIA:  US ASSISTANCE, </p><p>WOMEN IN POLITICS, JORDAN FIRST. </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.(C)  SUMMARY.  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near East </p><p>Affairs Elizabeth Cheney met with Queen Rania Oct 8 prior to </p><p>the third annual micro-entrepreneur awards ceremony, which </p><p>was held at the recently opened Zara Expo Center in Amman. </p><p>The Queen complimented the successes of AID programs in </p><p>Jordan, noted the potential for further micro-finance </p><p>development here and discussed with DAS Cheney ideas for </p><p>empowering women in Jordan and the region.  The Queen </p><p>lamented that Jordan\'s "track record is not good" regarding </p><p>the election of women into parliament but was hopeful that </p><p>this could change.  The Queen also articulated the GOJ\'s </p><p>"Jordan first" theme, saying that "the region needs an </p><p>example of a government that has a positive reflection on its </p><p>people."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  The Ambassador, DAS Cheney, AID Director Toni </p><p>Christiansen-Wagner, Mrs. Gnehm and poloff met with Queen </p><p>Rania and her personal assistant Oct 8 for a fifteen minute </p><p>meeting prior to the micro-entrepreneur award ceremony. </p><p>(Note:  the awards are given annually by a local </p><p>micro-finance association to micro entrepreneurs who receive </p><p>loans from AID for their business projects).  The Queen told </p><p>DAS Cheney that the area of micro-finance was something in </p><p>which she has a personal interest.  She also noted the </p><p>successes of AID programs in Jordan: "AID is excellent here. </p><p>It correctly identifies the areas of need, and realizes that </p><p>many areas and programs are interconnected."  The Queen </p><p>specifically noted AID\'s program on reproductive health as an </p><p>area of success. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  On the issue of empowering women in the middle east, </p><p>DAS Cheney explained that the Department will be hosting 65 </p><p>female political leaders from the middle east in the US </p><p>during the upcoming November elections.  The women will be </p><p>receiving campaign skills training and traveling outside </p><p>Washington to observe grassroots campaigning in preparation </p><p>for US mid-term elections.  Cheney explained that the US </p><p>hoped this would be a kick-off event for a larger regional </p><p>campaign school for women, with future activities to be held </p><p>in the region.  The Queen expressed strong support for this </p><p>program, and agreed that educating women on how to </p><p>successfully organize a political campaign is essential for </p><p>their success.  Noting that "organization is most important," </p><p>the Queen cited the success of the Islamic Action Front in </p><p>Jordan as due in large part to their strong organizational </p><p>ability.  She said that Jordan\'s "track record is not good," </p><p>on election of women to the parliament, noting that only one </p><p>has been elected by popular vote (Toujan Faisal).  The Queen </p><p>said that, in general, she is against a quota system to </p><p>ensure women are in parliament, but that perhaps a quota </p><p>system for the short-term would be necessary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  On domestic politics, the Queen said that she would </p><p>like to get Jordanians to focus on where politicians stand on </p><p>"four or five" specific issues, and hoped that people would </p><p>"move away from slogans" (i.e. exclusively anti-US and </p><p>anti-Israeli rhetoric) in domestic politics.  She noted that </p><p>it would be important for future elections to be about </p><p>"Jordanian" issues that truly affect people\'s lives.  There </p><p>are serious problems in Israel/Palestine and Iraq, the Queen </p><p>said, "but my husband always says that we have to carry on," </p><p>and that the government must focus on the needs of </p><p>Jordanians.  She said that it is not always easy to </p><p>communicate a message to the people but that, "the region </p><p>needs an example of a government that has a positive </p><p>reflection on its people." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  COMMENT.  The Queen\'s comments on domestic politics </p><p>are an articulation of the GOJ\'s "Jordan first" strategy, and </p><p>a further indication that during a period of heightened </p><p>regional tension, the GOJ is working on all fronts to </p><p>convince Jordanians that their interests must come first. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  DAS Cheney has cleared this message. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
