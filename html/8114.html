<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000905 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL:1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MASS, ETRD, EPET, EINV, KDEM, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VP ON POLITICS, PROSPECTS FOR REFORM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: Abuja 727 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  DCM 8 May met with VP Atiku Abubakar </p><p>and others in Washington.  Atiku sought continued USG </p><p>support for market-based economic reforms but </p><p>volunteered that President Obasanjo remained </p><p>uncomfortable about giving up State control.  Atiku </p><p>hoped to make progress on AGOA and to lift fuel price </p><p>subsidies.  He thought an Article 98 Agreement would </p><p>be signed soon.  Nigeria\'s VP believed the election </p><p>tribunals would call for new polls in some areas but </p><p>that results would not change; he did not think there </p><p>would be enduring negative consequences from electoral </p><p>disputes because most people ultimately must line up </p><p>with the winners.  Comment at para 14.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) DCM 8 May called on Nigerian Vice President </p><p>Alhaji Atiku Abubakar at the Potomac, Maryland </p><p>residence he shares with an AmCit wife of Nigerian </p><p>origin, Jennifer (aka Jamila).  Also present at </p><p>various points during the evening were former </p><p>Ambassador to the U.S., businessman Hassan Adamu, </p><p>ThisDay publisher Nduka Obaigbena, Nigerian Charge </p><p>Augustine Agada, and several members of Atiku\'s </p><p>personal staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DCM arrived to find Obaigbena with the VP, and </p><p>the first half-hour of the conversation was </p><p>unremarkable, save for Obaigbena\'s observation that </p><p>the U.S. attitude toward Nigeria appeared to have </p><p>cooled since September of 2001.  DCM replied that the </p><p>Administration had been compelled to confront the </p><p>threat of global terrorism and to focus on homeland </p><p>security.  Atiku found this explanation reasonable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ENDING FUEL SUBSIDIES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Once Obaigbena had left the room, DCM </p><p>congratulated Atiku on the effectiveness of the PDP </p><p>campaign and offered that signs pointed to Nigerians </p><p>fervently hoping for tangible betterment of their </p><p>circumstances.  DCM remarked that his own man-in-the- </p><p>street interviews indicated that most people were not </p><p>impressed by the transparency of the recent elections </p><p>but were very pleased with their peaceful conduct (in </p><p>most areas) and continuing relative tranquillity. </p><p>Many of the motorists waiting for fuel with whom DCM </p><p>had spoken (reftel) said they were praying for </p><p>Nigeria\'s God-chosen leaders to better their lot. </p><p>While they wanted gasoline, people waiting at a clinic </p><p>might desire medicines, and parents might want </p><p>classrooms and books for their children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Atiku said the GON needed to take quickly a </p><p>number of the hard steps that had been deferred during </p><p>the first term.  Had the motorists DCM had engaged </p><p>indicated readiness to pay more money for more </p><p>reliable fuel supplies?  DCM said he had not asked </p><p>that question specifically, offering that the official </p><p>price was fiction in much of the country.  The last </p><p>official price increase had reduced real prices in </p><p>much of the North; resistance would come from the </p><p>relatively few able to purchase at the official price. </p><p>Atiku emphatically agreed, saying that the President </p><p>had concurred in lifting fuel price subsidies o/a 1 </p><p>June.  Atiku added that meetings he and Obasanjo had </p><p>held with NLC President Adams Oshiomhole suggested </p><p>that organized labor would not resist strongly. </p><p>Implying that there existed a risk Obasanjo might </p><p>change his mind at the last minute, Atiku said his </p><p>fingers were crossed that the subsidies would, indeed, </p><p>be abolished as scheduled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>OTHER ECONOMIC REFORMS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Broader and deeper economic reforms would be </p><p>needed to get Nigeria\'s economy going again, Atiku </p><p>continued, but he was unsure how far President </p><p>Obasanjo was willing to go.  The President was </p><p>uncomfortable with markets making decisions and </p><p>fundamentally preferred State control.  DCM noted the </p><p>low price-to-dividend ratios of many public companies </p><p>listed in Nigeria and offered that Nigerian capital </p><p>markets appeared to have the potential to take off </p><p>once international investors became more comfortable </p><p>with Nigeria\'s economic prospects.  Had the GON </p><p>thought of floating perhaps ten percent of NNPC on the </p><p>stock exchange?  Atiku laughed and exclaimed, "Not </p><p>with this President.  No way!"  Atiku also held out </p><p>little hope for near-term reform of NNPC\'s major </p><p>downstream operations, noting that keeping the </p><p>refineries crippled provided irresistible </p><p>opportunities for well-connected rent-seekers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) However, Atiku emphasized, reforms that </p><p>reoriented Nigeria\'s economy toward market-based </p><p>outcomes were essential, and USG partnership and </p><p>support would be required.  The time had come to push </p><p>forward on AGOA, Atiku offered.  An echoing sentiment </p><p>came from former Ambassador Adamu, who had just joined </p><p>the conversation.  Atiku said all impetus had gone out </p><p>of Nigeria\'s AGOA-related efforts since the departure </p><p>of Mustapha Bello, the former Commerce Minister. </p><p>Nigeria needed to appoint an "AGOA Coordinator," Atiku </p><p>continued, someone who would make sure the necessary </p><p>steps were taken.  DCM offered that Nigeria\'s failure </p><p>to take such steps meant it could not take advantage </p><p>of AGOA\'s textile provisions.  Atiku said he would </p><p>ensure early National Assembly passage of the required </p><p>legislation and that he looked forward to working with </p><p>DCM to move the process forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) DCM cautioned that some tariffs and bans </p><p>Nigeria had put in place before the elections seemed </p><p>not consonant with WTO obligations and might affect </p><p>AGOA eligibility.  DCM noted that bans obviously could </p><p>be revised or revoked.  Atiku did not respond to the </p><p>implied question but remarked that the bans on </p><p>spaghetti and certain baked products had not taken </p><p>these items from supermarket shelves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION 557, ARTICLE 98 AND LIBYA </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) DCM noted that Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs Dubem Onyia\'s misrepresentation of the </p><p>circumstances that led to suspension of some aspects </p><p>of U.S. security assistance to Nigeria had indeed </p><p>irritated Washington.  The beginning of a new </p><p>Administration in Nigeria offered an excellent </p><p>opportunity to restore some lost warmth to a </p><p>fundamentally sound bilateral relationship.  Nigeria </p><p>could help us stop Libya\'s UNSC bid and look seriously </p><p>at concluding an Article 98 agreement.  Atiku did not </p><p>commit on Libya but said he understood our interests. </p><p>The term "Article 98 Agreement" did not initially </p><p>register with him, but when DCM explained what it was, </p><p>Atiku said he thought an agreement was being prepared </p><p>for signature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT:  Atiku plays a leading role in </p><p>economic affairs but does not normally engage on </p><p>politico-military issues with us.  We take some heart </p><p>from his understanding of the Article 98 issue and its </p><p>importance to us, but we would not want to be unduly </p><p>optimistic without confirmation from another source. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) DCM clarified for Atiku and Adamu the </p><p>circumstances that led to Congress\'s decision to </p><p>insert Section 557, as well as the fact that it did </p><p>not preclude expenditure of prior-year FMF already in </p><p>the pipeline.  Atiku wondered if the provision might </p><p>be lifted for FY 04.  DCM replied that Congress could </p><p>take that step but that, as long as the concerns </p><p>remained, it likely would not happen.  Atiku commented </p><p>that he had brokered a meeting between Obasanjo and </p><p>Tiv leaders and implied that the Zaki Biam massacre </p><p>was no longer an issue for most Tivs.  It was his </p><p>perception that the "Tiv lobby in the U.S." wielded </p><p>considerable influence over a particular Hill staffer, </p><p>who in turn influenced her boss.  DCM responded that </p><p>the Senator most concerned had long-standing concerns </p><p>about human rights in Nigeria and elsewhere and that </p><p>it would be too simplistic to attribute Section 557 to </p><p>the work of Tivs residing in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Elections Tribunals </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Atiku was adamant that opposition parties </p><p>would get little or nothing from appeals to the </p><p>elections tribunals.  He thought tribunals would order </p><p>new elections in some areas but averred that the </p><p>ultimate result would be the same in every case -- </p><p>victory for the ruling PDP.  He did not rebut DCM\'s </p><p>assertion that elections had not even taken place in </p><p>some areas but stated that the results were an </p><p>accurate reflection of popular will; the PDP had met </p><p>with community leaders and obtained their support. </p><p>The people did not reject the results and would follow </p><p>their leaders\' recommendations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Atiku did not anticipate significant unrest </p><p>as a result of eventual tribunal decisions that left </p><p>the opposition parties with no more National Assembly </p><p>seats and governorships than INEC awarded them </p><p>initially.  "Incumbency confers great advantage in our </p><p>system and here in Africa.  Not very many people want </p><p>to be in the opposition," he remarked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) We continue to believe that Nigerians\' </p><p>quiescence represents acquiescence more than </p><p>acceptance.  However, most Nigerians will accept the </p><p>second Obasanjo/Atiku Administration as long as their </p><p>lives improve materially.  This happening will be the </p><p>key to enduring democracy in Nigeria.  In this </p><p>respect, Atiku and his advisors may have a better idea </p><p>of how to proceed on a macro-economic level than does </p><p>Obasanjo, the man who created many of the publicly- </p><p>owned enterprises that now need to be dismantled.  At </p><p>the same time, however, Obasanjo\'s approach to </p><p>economic reform (assuming he is serious) likely will </p><p>resonate more with Nigerians.  The President would </p><p>prefer to fix what is broken (everything from Nigeria </p><p>Airways to the structures of State support to </p><p>agriculture) than to give the market much freer rein. </p><p>Atiku\'s approach might make more economic sense, but </p><p>it would prove more difficult politically to pursue </p><p>and implement than would Obasanjo\'s.  An early test of </p><p>direction will be whether fuel costs go up just a </p><p>trifle on June 1 or are allowed to rise to near the </p><p>world market price.  Atiku\'s frankly expressed </p><p>impatience with his boss indicates that tensions </p><p>between the two men continue little abated. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
