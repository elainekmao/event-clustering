<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 000418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR EB/ESC/ESP (GLASS), AF/EPS AND AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, EFIN, ECON, TU, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TERRORIST LIST 9 </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 10592 (B) ABUJA 187 (C) </p><p>     ANDREWS-EPSTEIN EMAIL 02/06/02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Mission officers met on February 6, per Ref C, to </p><p>discuss possible scenarios to lessen the negative impact of </p><p>freezing the assets of NASCO Nigeria and its affiliated </p><p>subsidiaries.  We found no way to separate the NASCO holding </p><p>company in Turkey from its Nigerian subsidiaries, which </p><p>employ more than 1500 Nigerians directly and several times </p><p>that indirectly.  Without entering into discussions with the </p><p>GON, we cannot begin to determine whether it would be </p><p>possible or feasible to stop funds generated in Nigeria from </p><p>reaching the Turkish holding company.  We know very little </p><p>about NASCO\'s corporate structure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Ref B described Mission perspectives on the impact of </p><p>freezing NASCO\'s assets on the local Jos community in Plateau </p><p>State and on U.S. relations with Nigeria\'s Islamic </p><p>population.  Since then, the political situation has </p><p>deteriorated.  Last week,s explosion of the Lagos armory, </p><p>the President,s perceived insensitivity, however </p><p>unjustified, to the plight of more than a thousand killed and </p><p>injured and more than 12,000 displaced, and government </p><p>incompetence in rescue and clean up of the unexploded </p><p>ordinance have wounded the President seriously.   This week\'s </p><p>attacks on northern Muslim Hausa by Yoruba vigilantes in </p><p>Lagos is being portrayed as &ethnic cleansing8 on northern </p><p>Nigerian radio programs.  Northern Muslims, who supported </p><p>Obasanjo in 1999, see him incapable of protecting them in </p><p>Lagos.  Even mainstream northern politicians are speaking of </p><p>the inevitability of retaliatory attacks on Christians in </p><p>Kano and Kaduna.  Nigerians with a historical perspective </p><p>remember that such attacks in Kano in 1966 were used as a </p><p>justification for the Igbo East to declare independence, the </p><p>act that led to the bloody Civil War.  We do not expect </p><p>widespread conflict to break out here, but applying sanctions </p><p>at this time on NASCO -- a major manufacturing company and </p><p>employer -- could be used as further ammunition by Obasanjo\'s </p><p>detractors, worsening his already difficult position.  In </p><p>short, it would be a very inopportune moment for the USG to </p><p>add to tensions in Nigeria, and applying sanctions to NASCO </p><p>would be seen as destabilizing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) This Mission is not privy to the links between NASCO </p><p>and international terrorism.  While most Nigerians roundly </p><p>condemn al-Qaeda, there is considerable support for Hamas -- </p><p>not for its suicide bombers, but for its clinics and schools. </p><p> That support extends beyond the Muslim community (Nigerian </p><p>and expatriate alike) to the left-leaning intelligentsia </p><p>centered in Lagos.  If, despite the information in paras one </p><p>to three (above) and ref B, a decision is made to list NASCO, </p><p>the Mission must have talking points for both public and </p><p>private use.  If NASCO\'s links are to Hamas rather than </p><p>al-Qaeda or Abu Sayyaf, or the like, we and the GON would be </p><p>in for a very rough ride. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
