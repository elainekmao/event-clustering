<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000772 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, CE, USTR, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  INDO-LANKA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT, THREE YEARS </p><p>ON </p><p> </p><p>REF: (a) 01 Colombo 00872 </p><p>     (b) 00 Colombo 00354 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The Indo-Lanka free trade agreement </p><p>(ILFTA) completed three years of operation in March </p><p>2003.  Trade between India and Sri Lanka increased </p><p>sharply in 2002.  India now offers zero tariffs on </p><p>4,150 items exported from Sri Lanka.  Several mid- </p><p>sized Indian companies have set up operations in Sri </p><p>Lanka taking advantage of the agreement.  Investors </p><p>from other countries are also expected to take </p><p>advantage of the ILFTA.  The free trade agreement </p><p>offers Sri Lanka an opportunity to become a regional </p><p>trading hub.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Trade liberalization </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Indo-Lanka free trade agreement is the first </p><p>bi-lateral free trade agreement signed by Sri Lanka. </p><p>Under the agreement, India has gradually phased out </p><p>tariffs for imports from Sri Lanka, except on 429 </p><p>items under a negative list, and tea, garments, and </p><p>textiles under quotas and/or preferential duties.  The </p><p>most recent liberalization was in March 2003, when </p><p>India removed tariffs on 2,799 items.  Consequently, </p><p>4,150 items from Sri Lanka are duty free to India from </p><p>March 2003.  In turn, Sri Lanka has offered 100% duty </p><p>concessions on about 1,100 items.  The import duty on </p><p>balance items will be phased out by 2008 except on </p><p>1,180 items on Sri Lanka\'s negative list.   Since June </p><p>2002, a joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) meeting is </p><p>held annually to discuss further liberalization.  Many </p><p>implementation problems were discussed at the first </p><p>JMC meeting held last June.  Sri Lanka\'s key tea and </p><p>garment sectors continue to ask for more leeway under </p><p>the agreement as they are currently subject to quotas </p><p>and restrictions on ports of entry.  According to the </p><p>Department of Commerce here, the next meeting of the </p><p>JMC is scheduled for June 2003 and is expected to </p><p>discuss services for the first time, although no </p><p>specific goals have been set yet. </p><p> </p><p>Increasing trade </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  During the past three years two-way trade of goods </p><p>between India and Sri Lanka has almost doubled </p><p>increasing to $1 billion in 2002, from about $560 </p><p>million in 1999.   Much of the increase is attributed </p><p>to imports from India to Sri Lanka.  In 2002, imports </p><p>from India increased by 40% to $835 million.  India is </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s number one import market, with a 14% </p><p>share; imported items include a wide variety of </p><p>industrial goods and food items, some of which receive </p><p>duty concessions under the ILFTA.  Significantly, the </p><p>agreement has allowed Sri Lanka to source a </p><p>substantial amount of its imports from India, which is </p><p>a cheaper supplier than Sri Lanka\'s usual import </p><p>markets in South East Asia. </p><p> </p><p>4.  On the export side, Sri Lanka\'s exports to India </p><p>increased substantially to $170 million in 2002 from </p><p>$70 million in 2001, but India still accounts for less </p><p>than 4% of total Sri Lankan exports.  Currently, 4,150 </p><p>items from Sri Lanka are eligible for duty free entry </p><p>to India, subject to 35% value addition in Sri Lanka. </p><p>Main items exported from Sri Lanka under the ILFTA are </p><p>copper and copper wire and rods, spices, clothing </p><p>accessories, furniture and fittings, tires and tea. </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s two main exports, tea and garments, have </p><p>quota restrictions under the ILFTA.  They receive duty </p><p>concessions ranging from 50% to 75%.  Sri Lankan </p><p>exports to India are expected to grow further this </p><p>year following duty concessions offered by India in </p><p>March 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Investment </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  According to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka </p><p>(BOI), since the implementation of the ILFTA in 2000, </p><p>73 Indian companies, with a total investment </p><p>commitment of Rs 36 billion ($400 million) have sought </p><p>to invest in Sri Lanka.  According to BOI, 42 of these </p><p>companies have signed agreements, with 20 projects </p><p>already in commercial operation.  Other projects are </p><p>awaiting approval.  Most of the Indian FDI has been by </p><p>small and medium scale industrialists and has been in </p><p>the industrial sector (metal-based projects, </p><p>industrial chemicals, rubber products, and electrical </p><p>wire and bulbs).  Some of the companies have found it </p><p>more economical to serve South India from Sri Lanka </p><p>than from other parts of India.  A few Sri Lankan </p><p>companies have also expanded their investments in </p><p>order to export to India.  These products include </p><p>plastic furniture, aluminum wire, biscuits and roofing </p><p>sheets. </p><p>6.  Sri Lanka is also expecting to attract third </p><p>country investment with intentions to exploit the </p><p>Indian market via Sri Lanka.  Already a few foreign </p><p>companies have built plants here to export to India. </p><p>The largest is a $20 million investment by a Malaysian </p><p>company exporting medium density fiber (MDF) board. </p><p>Meanwhile, a high-tech US company is considering a </p><p>proposal to assemble telecom parts in Sri Lanka for </p><p>export to India.  This product, which carries a MFN </p><p>duty of 35% in India, can be exported duty free from </p><p>Sri Lanka.  BOI promotion officers told the Embassy </p><p>that they are pursuing plans to promote Sri Lanka </p><p>through the ILFTA to select U.S. companies. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka as a regional hub </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. Sri Lanka\'s strategic location in the Indian ocean </p><p>near the shipping lanes connecting east and west, its </p><p>close proximity to Indian subcontinent and its largely </p><p>liberalized trade regime together make it an ideal </p><p>location for a regional hub in South Asia.  The ILFTA </p><p>links Sri Lanka to the large Indian market with a </p><p>population of over one billion people.  In addition, </p><p>Sri Lanka is negotiating a free trade agreement with </p><p>Pakistan (population 150 million) and also plans to </p><p>discuss a FTA with Bangladesh.  Further, the </p><p>Government\'s latest economic policy document </p><p>"Regaining Sri Lanka" states that the Government will </p><p>seek to develop new markets through bilateral and </p><p>regional trading agreements with additional countries. </p><p>In addition to benefits accrued through these trade </p><p>pacts, companies setting up in Sri Lanka can import </p><p>raw materials duty free, obtain tax holidays and have </p><p>access to an educated, easily trainable workforce. </p><p> </p><p>8.  In order to meet hub status, Sri Lanka is in the </p><p>early stages of planning to upgrade its </p><p>infrastructure.  Among the plans are major expansions </p><p>to the international airport and the Colombo port.  In </p><p>addition, there are plans to build a new port in </p><p>Hambantota in the southern province.  Preliminary </p><p>studies to build a land bridge between India and Sri </p><p>Lanka have been completed. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The ILFTA is not perfect, and far from what the US </p><p>would consider a gold-standard FTA.  Still, it is an </p><p>important start in a region where, with the exception </p><p>of Sri Lanka, tariffs remain among the highest in the </p><p>world.  As SAARC\'s efforts to stimulate regional trade </p><p>remain stalled, Sri Lanka is assembling an apparatus </p><p>of FTAs that will allow it to function as a trading </p><p>hub for South Asia.  This island of 20 million people </p><p>may be South Asia\'s best shot at increasing intra- </p><p>regional trade flows - and the outside world\'s best </p><p>shot at penetrating the largely closed South Asian </p><p>market. </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
