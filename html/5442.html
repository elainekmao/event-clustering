(SBU) POST FEEDBACK ON REFTEL WTO BIOTECH MEDIA STRATEGY </p><p>IS SHAPED BY OUR ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN THE ISSUE AND </p><p>CROATIA\'S STATUS AS AN EU ASPIRANT WHICH PLANS TO SUBMIT AN </p><p>APPLICATION FOR ACCESSION NEXT MONTH.  IN CROATIA, THERE IS </p><p>LITTLE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF TRADE ISSUES, EVEN LESS OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL OR DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.  THUS OUR </p><p>CAMPAIGN WOULD FOCUS ON ISSUES DEAR TO CROATIANS -- THE FOOD </p><p>THEY EAT AND THEIR DESIRE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY ARE EATING. </p><p> END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>REACTIONS TO SUGGESTED MESSAGES </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) POST GENERALLY AGREES WITH THE THEMES OFFERED </p><p>REFTEL. TO TAILOR THE MESSAGE, AFTER MAKING THE STRONG POINT </p><p>THAT THE WTO DISPUTE IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER THE BIOTECH IS SAFE </p><p>OR NOT -- THE EU CONCEDES IT IS -- BUT RATHER THE FAILURE OF </p><p>THE EU TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED RULES, </p><p>WE NEED TO ADDRESS VIGOROUSLY THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT </p><p>BIOTECH FOODS ARE SUSPECT AND THAT THE US DOES NOT RESPECT </p><p>CROATIANS\' RIGHT TO CHOOSE.  IF WE DO NOT OVERCOME THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00245  01 OF 02  311719Z </p><p>PERCEPTION, WE COULD WIN THE TRADE BATTLE BUT LOSE THE </p><p>MARKETING WAR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO REFTEL: </p><p> </p><p>-- THEMES A AND B (WTO COMMITMENTS, RULES-BASED APPROVAL </p><p>PROCESS):  WE NEED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE EU HAS A PROCESS TO </p><p>REVIEW APPLICATIONS FOR THE BIOTECH PRODUCTS, HAS DETERMINED </p><p>THEY ARE SAFE, AND IS STALLING NONE THE LESS.  WHILE A </p><p>DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE TRADE ISSUES MAY BE USEFUL FOR OUR </p><p>GOVERNMENT INTERLOCUTOR, WE WILL NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE FOR </p><p>THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>-- THEME C (MISINFORMATION AGGRAVATING FAMINE IN AFRICA): TO </p><p>DATE, THE CROATIAN PUBLIC HAS NOT BEEN SEIZED WITH THIS </p><p>ISSUE.  ITS RECEPTIVITY TO THIS MESSAGE IS UNCERTAIN. </p><p> </p><p>- THEME D (BIOTECH SAFE, NO SCIENTIFIC BASE FOR MORATORIUM): </p><p>THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THEME TO PURSUE IN CROATIA. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, FOR EVERY SCIENTIFIC STUDY WE CAN OFFER UP, </p><p>THE OPPONENTS OF BIOTECH ARE ABLE TO OFFER UP ANOTHER STUDY, </p><p>WHICH WHILE OF MORE-THAN-DUBIOUS QUALITY, OFTEN REDUCE OUR </p><p>IMPACT.  CITING SOURCES WHICH HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BIOTECH IS </p><p>SAFE, SUCH AS THE EU ITSELF AND THE WHO, WOULD BE VALUABLE, </p><p>AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED MORE NEUTRAL THAN THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>-- THEME E (BIOTECH WILL HELP DEVELOPING COUNTRIES): </p><p>CROATIANS ARE NOT OVERLY CONCERNED WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH IN </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; WHAT THEY WORRY ABOUT IS ERODING A </p><p>NICHE THEY HOPE TO EXPLOIT AS AN UNSPOILED, "NATURAL" </p><p>MEDITERRANEAN PARADISE FOR EUROPEAN TOURISTS.  THEY ARE ALSO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00245  01 OF 02  311719Z </p><p>WORRIED THAT IF THEY PLANT BIOTECH FOODS, THEY MAY ENDANGER </p><p>THEIR EXPORT PROSPECTS TO THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>-- THEME F (BIOTECH ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL): CROATIANS </p><p>ARE NOT INTELLECTUALLY CONSISTENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT.  THE </p><p>MAJORITY OF CROATIANS REGARD CROATIA AS ENVIRONMENTALLY PURE </p><p>AND ARE PERFECTLY WILLING TO THINK OF GMO-FREE FOODS AS </p><p>"HEALTHY FOODS," NO MATTER HOW MUCH PESTICIDE WAS USED TO </p><p>GROW THEM.  NEVERTHELESS, IT IS A MESSAGE WORTH PUTTING OUT, </p><p>HOPEFULLY APPEALING TO SOME MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE </p><p>PEOPLE AT THE MARGINS AND POINTING UP THE FALLACY THAT </p><p>GMO-FREE EQUALS "ENVIRONMENTAL."  FIGURES SHOWING HOW MUCH </p><p>PESTICIDE IS USED ON AN AMERICAN CORNFIELD VERSUS ITS </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTERPART COULD BE ILLUMINATING. </p><p> </p><p>-- THEME G (CONSUMER CHOICE): THIS COULD BE A POWERFUL </p><p>ARGUMENT HERE.  BUT IT IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD, SINCE THE </p><p>CROATIAN PUBLIC BELIEVES CONSUMER CHOICE MUST BE ENSURED BY </p><p>LABELING.  A RECENT US SPEAKER TRIED TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT </p><p>THAT LABELING OF BIOTECH FOODS WOULD REDUCE CONSUMER CHOICE. </p><p>GROCERY MANUFACTURERS WOULD REFUSE TO USE BIOTECH SOURCES </p><p>SINCE CONSUMERS WOULD INEVITABLY REJECT BIOTECH FOODS LABELED </p><p>AS SUCH.  THIS ARGUMENT DID NOT FIND RESONANCE HERE.  EVEN </p><p>OUR STAUNCHEST ALLIES -- THE REPUTABLE, SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC </p><p>COMMUNITY, AGRONOMISTS, TRADE AND REGULATORY OFFICIALS -- </p><p>THINK THAT MANDATORY LABELING IS AN INDISPENSABLE FIRST STEP </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1718 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00245  02 OF 02  311720Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    ACE-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     EPAE-00 </p><p>      ECA-00   IIP-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /012W </p><p>                  ------------------2F1ED4  311753Z /38 </p><p>R 311702Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9357 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000245 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/PADILLA </p><p>STATE FOR EB/EPPD/PD AND EUR/PPD </p><p>VIENNA FOR FAS </p><p>BUDAPEST FOR ENVIRO HUB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, EAGR, ETRD, TBIO, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: WTO BIOTECH PUBLIC DIPLOMACY RESOURCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00245  02 OF 02  311720Z </p><p>QUERY-CROATIAN CONTEXT </p><p> </p><p>TOWARD DISPELLING UNFOUNDED CONSUMER FEARS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WE MUST BE PREPARED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION "GIVEN </p><p>CROATIA\'S DESIRE TO EXPORT TO THE EU, WEAK REGULATORY </p><p>STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONS, AND SMALL AREA, DOES THIS ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE EU MEAN THAT THE US WILL NOT ALLOW CROATIA THE </p><p>TIME TO PUT INTO PLACE ALL THE STRUCTURES WE NEED TO CONTROL </p><p>BIOTECH CROPS AND TO PROVIDE THE MONITORING OUR POPULACE </p><p>DEMANDS OF OUR FOOD STOCKS?" </p><p> </p><p>ALLIES IN A PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) OUR BEST ALLIES IN THE PRO-BIOTECH CAMPAIGN HAVE </p><p>BEEN SCIENTISTS, MAINLY THOSE WHO THEMSELVES WORK IN THE AREA </p><p>OF BIOTECHNOLOGY.  MUCH OF THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL </p><p>INDUSTRIES SEE BIOTECH AS EITHER A DIRECT COMPETITIVE THREAT, </p><p>OR A RISK FACTOR FOR FUTURE EXPORTS TO THE EU, SO HAVE NOT </p><p>BEEN PUBLIC SUPPORTERS OF BIOTECH.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY HAVE </p><p>BEEN COWED BY A VOCAL, LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL NGO FROM EVEN </p><p>THINKING ABOUT SOURCING BIOTECH INPUTS.  WE DO NOT KNOW OF </p><p>ANY JOURNALISTS WHO COULD BE CALLED "ADVOCATES" FOR BIOTECH, </p><p>BUT A NUMBER ARE WILLING TO PRESENT BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY. </p><p> </p><p>SPECIFICS OF LOCAL REACTIONS TO A WTO-CASE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MANY CROATIANS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS, CLAIM THE US APPLIES A HARSHER STANDARD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00245  02 OF 02  311720Z </p><p>AGAINST CROATIA THAN OTHER COUNTRIES.  THEY HAVE ACCUSED US </p><p>OF THREATENING CROATIA WITH A WTO CASE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONSIDERED INTRODUCING A TEMPORARY BAN ON THE IMPORT OF GMOS </p><p>(A DISTORTION OF THE TRUE STORY), WHILE ALLEGEDLY ALLOWING </p><p>NEW ZEALAND AND THE EU TO LIMIT THE IMPORT OF THESE PRODUCTS. </p><p> ALSO, A DE FACTO BAN ON SOME PRODUCTS IS IN PLACE WHILE THE </p><p>CROATIAN GOVERNMENT GLACIALLY DEVELOPS LEGISLATION AND </p><p>GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING AND APPROVING BIOTECH PRODUCTS.  A </p><p>WTO CASE WOULD SERVE NOTICE THAT WE WILL NOT ACCEPT </p><p>INDEFINITE DELAYS.  HOWEVER, IT RISKS ALSO HARDENING ALREADY </p><p>ENTRENCHED NEGATIVE FEELINGS ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THAT WE HOPE </p><p>TO SELL. </p><p> </p><p>THE MESSAGE </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN CROATIA, THE MOST EFFECTIVE MESSAGE WOULD </p><p>EMPHASIZE THAT THE EU ITSELF HAS FOUND THESE FOODS TO BE NO </p><p>MORE RISKY THAN TRADITIONAL FOODS.  THE EU HAS HAD BIOTECH </p><p>CROPS (SOY AND CORN) ON THE MARKET FOR YEARS WITH NO ILL </p><p>EFFECTS, AND DESPITE THIS IT IS RAISING ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS. </p><p>WE ARE NOT ASKING THAT THE EU DISPENSE WITH ITS APPROVAL </p><p>PROCESS, BUT RATHER ASKING IT TO START USING IT. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
