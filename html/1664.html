(C) THE QUIET ATTEMPT BY THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p>(CFU) TO RE-ENGAGE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) </p><p>ON LAND REFORM (REFTEL) HAS REACHED AN IMPASSE.  THE GOZ </p><p>IS INSISTING AS A PRECONDITION FOR FURTHER TALKS THAT </p><p>THE CFU WITHDRAW ITS LAWSUIT CHALLENGING THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF "FAST-TRACK", EVEN THOUGH THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY RULED IN FAVOR OF THE CFU.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, THE GOZ, WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE AIR </p><p>FORCE, ARMY, POLICE AND THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION (CIO), HAS BEGUN A NEW PUSH TO QUICKLY GET </p><p>ADDITIONAL SQUATTERS ONTO COMMERCIAL FARMS NATIONWIDE. </p><p>ON APRIL 25, THE GOZ-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" NEWSPAPER </p><p>REPORTED THAT THE GOZ PLANS TO SUBMIT A BILL TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT THAT WILL LEGALIZE THE STATUS OF FARM </p><p>INVADERS AND PREVENT THEIR EVICTION UNTIL THE GOZ IS </p><p>ABLE TO RESETTLE THEM.  LARGE-SCALE WHITE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS, WHO GROW MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>WHEAT CROP, HAVE NOT RECEIVED GUARANTEES FROM THE GOZ </p><p>THAT THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO HARVEST IF THEY PLANT AND </p><p>THEREFORE HAVE DELAYED PLANTING A CROP.

A VISIT TO TWO </p><p>FARMS IN A DISTRICT SOUTHWEST OF HARARE INDICATES THAT </p><p>THE GOZ IS PROVIDING LITTLE OR NO ASSISTANCE TO THE </p><p>RESETTLED FARMERS.

(C) ON APRIL 27, ECONOFF SPOKE WITH TIM HENWOOD </p><p>(PROTECT), PRESIDENT OF THE CFU, AT THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE FAIR IN BULAWAYO.  HENWOOD SAID THAT </p><p>THE QUIET TALKS INITIATED BY THE CFU WITH THE GOZ TO TRY </p><p>AND FIND A WAY FORWARD ON LAND REFORM HAVE REACHED AN </p><p>IMPASSE.  THE GOZ IS INSISTING THAT THE CFU MUST </p><p>WITHDRAW ITS LITIGATION AGAINST THE GOZ OVER THE "FAST- </p><p>TRACK" RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM BEFORE THE GOZ WILL TALK </p><p>FURTHER WITH THE CFU.  THE CFU NEGOTIATING TEAM WAS TOLD </p><p>BY GOZ OFFICIALS THAT THE LAWSUIT, AND THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>JUDGEMENT IN THE CFU\'S FAVOR ON THE SUIT, IS VERY </p><p>EMBARRASSING TO PRESIDENT MUGABE.  HOWEVER, HENWOOD SAID </p><p>THAT THE CFU CANNOT WITHDRAW A LAWSUIT UPON WHICH A </p><p>COURT HAS ALREADY RENDERED JUDGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>A NEW GOZ PUSH TO GET MORE SQUATTERS ON FARMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01492  01 OF 04  031833Z </p><p>3. (C) ON APRIL 12 ECONOFF SPOKE WITH TIM EVANS </p><p>(PROTECT), THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CFU MWENEZI DISTRICT </p><p>FARMERS ASSOCIATION.  (NOTE: MWENEZI IS LOCATED IN </p><p>SOUTHERN ZIMBABWE NEAR THE BORDER WITH SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>END NOTE.)  EVANS STATED THAT THREE TEAMS FROM THE GOZ </p><p>NATIONAL LAND TASK FORCE (NLTF) HAD RECENTLY VISITED </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS IN MWENEZI AND TWO NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS. </p><p>THE MWENEZI DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR (DA), WHO IS ON </p><p>FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS, TOLD EVANS </p><p>THAT THE THREE TEAMS WERE HEADED UP BY ZIMBABWE AIR </p><p>FORCE VICE MARSHALL MUCHENA, ZIMBABWE NATIONAL ARMY </p><p>MAJOR GENERAL NYAMBUZA, AND ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE </p><p>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF CRIME MUTANGA.  CENTRAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION AGENTS WERE ALSO TEAM MEMBERS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE DA, THE PURPOSE OF THE NLTF TEAMS </p><p>VISITS WAS TO GO TO OCCUPIED FARMS AND TELL THE INVADERS </p><p>THAT THEY HAD TO STAY ON THE FARMS, AND THAT THEY NEEDED </p><p>TO FIND ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO INVADE FARMS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE DA, THIS IS PART OF THE GOZ\'S EFFORT TO GET ANOTHER </p><p>2,500 INVADERS ONTO COMMERCIAL FARMS IN EACH OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S TEN PROVINCES -- FOR A TOTAL OF 25,000 NEW </p><p>INVADERS NATIONWIDE -- BY JUNE.  EVANS STATED THAT THE </p><p>MAJORITY OF THE OCCUPIED FARMS IN MWENENZI AND THE TWO </p><p>NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS HAVE NOT BEEN LISTED FOR </p><p>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION BY THE GOZ.

TIM HENWOOD </p><p>TOLD ECONOFF THAT SIMILAR NLTF TEAMS HAVE BEEN VISITING </p><p>FARMS IN ALL TEN OF ZIMBABWE\'S PROVINCES OVER THE LAST </p><p>FEW WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>A GOZ BILL TO LEGALIZE THE FARM INVADERS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ON APRIL 25, THE GOZ-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" </p><p>NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT THE GOZ IS GOING TO SUBMIT A </p><p>BILL TO PARLIAMENT THAT WILL LEGALIZE THE STATUS OF </p><p>ILLEGAL OCCUPIERS ON COMMERCIAL FARMS.  THE BILL WILL </p><p>NULLIFY SUPREME COURT AND HIGH COURT RULINGS REQUIRING </p><p>THAT ILLEGAL OCCUPIERS BE IMMEDIATELY EVICTED FROM </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS AND OTHER OCCUPIED LANDS.  THE BILL </p><p>INCLUDES SPECIFIC PROVISIONS REGARDING WHEN INDIVIDUALS </p><p>MUST HAVE OCCUPIED FARMS, AND ENTITLES THEM TO LEGAL </p><p>PROTECTION FROM EVICTION FOR SPECIFIC PERIODS UNTIL THE </p><p>GOZ IS ABLE TO RESETTLE THEM.  THE BILL GIVES PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE, ALL CABINET MINISTERS, AND ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS </p><p>DESIGNATED BY THE PRESIDENT, AUTHORITY TO CERTIFY ANY </p><p>FARM INVADERS AS "PROTECTED PERSONS" WHO CANNOT BE </p><p>EVICTED FROM THE FARMS THEY OCCUPY.  (COMMENT: RECENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01492  02 OF 04  021425Z </p><p>GOZ PRACTICE INDICATES THAT THE RULING PARTY WILL FAST- </p><p>TRACK THE BILL THROUGH PARLIAMENT, WITH LITTLE OR NO </p><p>DEBATE AND NO AMENDMENTS, AND ITS LEGAL PROVISIONS WILL </p><p>THEN BE INTERPRETED LIBERALLY BY THE GOZ.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS NOT PLANTING WHEAT </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AS OF APRIL 27, COMMERCIAL FARMERS WHO NORMALLY </p><p>GROW OVER EIGHTY PERCENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S WHEAT AND PLANT </p><p>AT THE END OF APRIL, HAD NOT BEGUN PLANTING THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>CROP.  CFU PRESIDENT HENWOOD TOLD ECONOFF THAT THE </p><p>FARMERS HAD STILL NOT RECEIVED ANY GUARANTEE FROM THE </p><p>GOZ THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HARVEST A WHEAT CROP IF </p><p>PLANTED.  WITHOUT SUCH A GUARANTEE, ZIMBABWE\'S BANKS </p><p>WILL NOT LOAN MONEY FOR WHEAT PLANTING, AND THE FARMERS </p><p>THEMSELVES WILL NOT RISK THEIR PERSONAL CAPITAL ON </p><p>PLANTING A CROP THEY MAY NOT BE ALLOWED TO HARVEST AND </p><p>SELL.  IN ADDITION, HENWOOD SAID THAT MOST OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>LARGEST WHEAT GROWERS ARE IN THE THREE MASHONALAND </p><p>PROVINCES, WHERE WAR VETS HAVE RECENTLY BECOME MORE </p><p>AGGRESSIVE IN INTERFERING WITH FARM OPERATIONS. </p><p>ZIMBABWE ONLY HAS AN ESTIMATED TWO-MONTH SUPPLY OF WHEAT </p><p>REMAINING, AND IF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS ARE NOT ALLOWED </p><p>TO PLANT WHEAT IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, ZIMBABWE WILL BE </p><p>REQUIRED TO IMPORT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL TONS </p><p>OF WHEAT OVER ITS NORMAL IMPORT REQUIREMENTS AT A TIME </p><p>WHEN THE GOZ HAS NO HARD CURRENCY.  WHEAT IS AN </p><p>IRRIGATED CROP IN ZIMBABWE, AND THE MAJORITY OF COMMUNAL </p><p>FARMERS DO NOT HAVE THE IRRIGATION SYSTEMS REQUIRED FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01492  02 OF 04  021425Z </p><p>GROWING WHEAT AND THUS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FILL THE VOID </p><p>LEFT IF COMMERCIAL FARMERS DO NOT PLANT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>GOZ NOT PAYING FARMERS FOR FARMS ALREADY ACQUIRED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) CONTRARY TO ITS STATEMENTS IN THE PRESS, THE GOZ </p><p>HAS YET TO PAY COMMERCIAL FARMERS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO </p><p>THE LAND FOR FARMS THAT HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE </p><p>GOZ.  A NUMBER OF FARMS HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE GOZ BY </p><p>INDIVIDUAL FARMERS FOR RESETTLEMENT SINCE "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>BEGAN LAST JUNE.  THIS SITUATION HAS LEFT THESE FARMERS, </p><p>WHO IN GOOD FAITH CEDED THEIR FARMS TO THE GOZ, </p><p>FINANCIALLY HIGH-AND-DRY.  IN ONE EXAMPLE, A CHEGUTU </p><p>CATTLE RANCHER, WHO OWNED FOUR PIECES OF LAND THAT </p><p>TOGETHER MADE UP HIS RANCH, OFFERED THE TWO OUTLYING </p><p>PIECES OF LAND TO THE GOZ LAST JULY.  HE STILL HAS NOT </p><p>RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THE GOZ REGARDING THESE TWO </p><p>PIECES OF LAND, LET ALONE PAYMENT FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO </p><p>THE LAND, WHEN ECONOFF VISITED HIM ON APRIL 10.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE MAIN PIECE OF LAND THAT IS THE HEART OF </p><p>HIS RANCH, AND ON WHICH HIS HOUSE IS LOCATED, WAS </p><p>INVADED BY ALLEGED WAR VETS AND OTHER PEOPLE IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER.

(C) ON APRIL 10, ECONOFF TOURED CHEGUTU DISTRICT </p><p>SOUTHWEST OF HARARE WITH ED GUNDRY (PROTECT), THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE CFU MASHONALAND WEST - SOUTH REGION </p><p>(WITHIN WHICH CHEGUTU DISTRICT FALLS), AND BEN FREETH </p><p>(PROTECT), THE REGIONAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THIS SAME </p><p>DISTRICT.  IN ADDITION TO VISITING TWO COMMERCIAL FARMS </p><p>WHERE TOBACCO IS THE PRINCIPAL CROP AND CATTLE RANCHING </p><p>IS A SIDE VENTURE, ECONOFF VISITED TWO FARMS IN CHEGUTU </p><p>THAT HAVE BEEN "RESETTLED" BY THE GOZ -- ONE DURING </p><p>1998, AND THE OTHER SINCE "FAST-TRACK" BEGAN IN JUNE OF </p><p>LAST YEAR.  BOTH OF THESE FARMS WERE FORMERLY LARGE- </p><p>SCALE TOBACCO AND CATTLE RANCHING OPERATIONS.  THE SOIL </p><p>ON THESE FARMS IS VERY SANDY, MAKING IT IDEAL FOR </p><p>GROWING TOBACCO, AND SUITABLE FOR CATTLE RANCHING GIVEN </p><p>SUFFICIENT GRAZING AREA.  THIS SOIL IS NOT WELL SUITED </p><p>FOR GROWING MAIZE OR OTHER CROPS WITHOUT EXTENSIVE USE </p><p>OF FERTILIZER AS WELL AS CROP ROTATION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE FARM THAT WAS RESETTLED IN JUNE LAST YEAR WAS </p><p>NEARLY DESERTED.  ACCORDING TO FREETH, A YEAR EARLIER IT </p><p>HAD BEEN A THRIVING TOBACCO FARM WITH A LARGE CATTLE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01492  03 OF 04  021426Z </p><p>HERD.  NOW VISIBLE WERE OCCASIONAL THATCH-ROOFED MUD </p><p>HUTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH APPEARED UNOCCUPIED. </p><p>ACCORDING TO FREETH, MOST OF THOSE RESETTLED LEFT </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER BUILDING THE HUTS WHEN THEY REALIZED HOW </p><p>POOR THE SOIL WAS FOR GROWING MAIZE AND THAT THEY WERE </p><p>NOT GOING TO GET ASSISTANCE FROM THE GOZ.  IN EVIDENCE </p><p>WERE A FEW SMALL PATCHES OF STUNTED MAIZE CROPS, NONE OF </p><p>WHICH WERE GOING TO PRODUCE EDIBLE MAIZE.  WEEDS WERE </p><p>GROWING IN THE FORMER TOBACCO FIELDS AND THE GRAZING </p><p>AREAS WERE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING OVERTAKEN BY SCRUB. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE FARM RESETTLED IN 1998 WAS MARGINALLY </p><p>DIFFERENT IN CONDITION FROM THE ONE RESETTLED AFTER </p><p>"FAST-TRACK" LAST JUNE.  THIS PROPERTY HAD MORE FAMILIES </p><p>VISIBLY LIVING ON SITE IN THEIR MUD HUTS, WITH MORE </p><p>PLOTS OF STUNTED MAIZE, AS WELL AS COTTON, MOST OF WHICH </p><p>HAD NOT FLOWERED TO PRODUCE A CROP.  THERE WAS ALSO THE </p><p>OCCASIONAL COW VISIBLE.  THE FORMER TOBACCO FIELDS, </p><p>EXCEPT FOR THE SCATTERED PLOTS OF STUNTED MAIZE AND </p><p>COTTON, WERE COMPLETELY OVERGROWN WITH WEEDS.  THERE WAS </p><p>NO INDICATION THAT THE GOZ HAD PROVIDED ANY </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE ASSISTANCE, SUCH AS DAMS, IRRIGATION </p><p>SYSTEMS OR BUILDINGS IN THE MORE THAN TWO YEARS SINCE </p><p>RESETTLEMENT.  WHILE THE GOZ MAY HAVE PROVIDED SEED </p><p>PACKS AND FERTILIZER TO THOSE RESETTLED, THIS WAS </p><p>CLEARLY NOT SUFFICIENT ASSISTANCE EVEN TO MAKE THEM </p><p>SUCCESSFUL SUBSISTENCE FARMERS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) GUNDRY, THE CFU CHAIRMAN FOR THIS DISTRICT, SAID </p><p>THAT THIS PATTERN WAS REPLICATED ACROSS THE DISTRICT </p><p>WHERE THE GOZ HAD "RESETTLED" PEOPLE WITHOUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01492  03 OF 04  021426Z </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DONOR ASSISTANCE.  ON THE WAY BACK TO THE </p><p>REGIONAL CFU OFFICE, WE DROVE BY ANOTHER PIECE OF LAND </p><p>THAT WAS OVERGROWN WITH WEEDS AND BRUSH AND APPEARED </p><p>ABANDONED.  GUNDRY STATED THAT THIS FARM HAD ALSO BEEN </p><p>"RESETTLED" IN 1998 BY THE GOZ.
