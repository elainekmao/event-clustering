<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 001278 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR (BOGUE) AND PM (LINO) </p><p>DEFENSE FOR OSD/DASD-EURASIA (RICARDEL), OSD-P (RIGGENBERG) </p><p>AND DSCA-ERASA </p><p>    USEUCOM FOR J4 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, KTIA, ABUD, MASS, HR, KICC, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMITTING CROATIA\'S FY-2003 FMF BUDGET </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 139892 </p><p>     B. ZAGREB 1238 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IF CROATIA ACTS QUICKLY, IT CAN COMMIT THE FY2003 </p><p>FUNDS AT RISK OF SUSPENSION UNDER THE AMERICAN </p><p>SERVICEMEMBER\'S PROTECTION ACT BEFORE CUTOFF DATE.  AS </p><p>INSTRUCTED (REFTEL A), ON JUNE 4 WE INFORMED THE GOC HOW IT </p><p>CAN COMMIT THE USD 5.5 MILLION ALLOCATED FOR FY2003 TO AN </p><p>EXISTING FMF CASE IN TIME FOR THESE FUNDS TO BE OBLIGATED BY </p><p>JULY 1.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CROATIA IS UNLIKELY TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>BEFORE UNOBLIGATED FMF AND IMET FUNDS ARE SUSPENDED ON JULY </p><p>1.  AS INSTRUCTED IN REF A, DEFENSE ATTACHE, ODC CHIEF AND </p><p>POLOFF MET ON JUNE 4 WITH DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER ZLATKO </p><p>GARELJIC TO INFORM HIM THAT THE USD 5.5 MILLION ALLOCATED TO </p><p>CROATIA IN FMF FUNDING COULD BE OBLIGATED BEFORE SUSPENSION </p><p>ON JULY 1.  WE UNDERSCORED TO GARELJIC THAT THE FAILURE OF </p><p>CROATIA TO CONCLUDE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WOULD STILL HAVE </p><p>A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP; </p><p>    NEARLY USD 6 MILLION IN FMF AND IMET SUPPORT ANTICIPATED IN </p><p>FY 2004 WOULD CERTAINLY BE SUSPENDED.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE </p><p>ADDED, CROATIA\'S UNWILLINGNESS TO CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT WOULD </p><p>BE A BLOW TO THE BROADER BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AS DESCRIBED IN REF B, WE EXPLAINED TO DEPUTY DEFMIN </p><p>GARELJIC THAT, DUE TO THE SHORT TIME REMAINING BEFORE THE </p><p>JULY 1 CUTOFF, THE ONLY WAY CROATIA CAN COMMIT THE FY2003 FMF </p><p>FUNDS IS TO COMMIT THEM TO AN EXISTING CASE.  THE ONLY "OPEN" </p><p>CASE WHICH COULD BE MODIFIED IN TIME IS FOR COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>EQUIPMENT.  AS ADDITIONAL VHF RADIO EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN </p><p>IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY, CROATIA SHOULD ACT QUICKLY TO </p><p>MODIFY THIS CASE.  WE TOLD GARELJIC CROATIA MUST SEND A </p><p>LETTER OF REQUEST TO MODIFY THE EXISTING FMF CASE BY FRIDAY, </p><p>JUNE 6, IN ORDER FOR EXPERTS IN WASHINGTON TO OBLIGATE THE </p><p>FUNDS IN TIME TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING SUSPENDED.  ODC </p><p>PROVIDED GARELJIC WITH A DRAFT LETTER, PROPOSING A MIX OF </p><p>AVAILABLE VHF RADIO EQUIPMENT WHICH WOULD MEET NEEDS </p><p>IDENTIFIED BY MOD PLANNERS.  THE MOD HAS FLEXIBILITY WITHIN </p><p>THIS FMF CASE TO CHANGE THE MIX OF EQUIPMENT, BUT MAY NOT </p><p>APPLY FY 2003 FUNDS TO ANY OTHER CASE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN A SEPARATE MEETINGS ON JUNE 4 WITH ASSISTANT </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER (POLICY) JELENA GRCIC POLIC AND WITH MFA </p><p>NORTH AMERICA DEPARTMENT HEAD MIROSLAV KOVACIC, WE </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT THE DECISION ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT PROVISION </p><p>OF THE ASPA WAS MADE IN WASHINGTON AND APPLIES EQUALLY TO ALL </p><p>COUNTRIES WHICH ARE RECIPIENTS OF FMF AND IMET FUNDING AND </p><p>ARE SUBJECT TO THE JULY 1 CUTOFF.  NEVERTHELESS, BOTH KOVACIC </p><p>AND GRCIC POLIC WERE GRATEFUL, AND SAID THAT THE FMF </p><p>ASSISTANCE IS VITAL TO CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARD NATO </p><p>    MEMBERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) UPON HEARING THAT CROATIA MIGHT YET BE ABLE TO TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF FY 2003 FUNDS, GARELJIC, GRCIC POLIC AND KOVACIC </p><p>ALL EXPRESSED GRATITUDE, STATING THEIR ASSUMPTION THAT THE </p><p>USG\'S DECISION WAS BASED ON RECOGNITION OF CROATIA\'S CURRENT </p><p>REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM ASPA PROVISIONS DUE TO ITS </p><p>PURPORTED "UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES."  IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE OUR </p><p>FMF REPROGRAMMING EFFORT, THUS UNDERCUTTING OUR DIPLOMACY FOR </p><p>AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT, WE MADE CLEAR TO ALL THREE THAT THIS </p><p>SAME INTERPRETATION OF U.S. LAW IS BEING APPLIED TO ALL </p><p>COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO SUSPENSION OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE UNDER </p><p>ASPA AND REPEATED OUR REQUEST THAT THE GOC ENGAGE SERIOUSLY </p><p>IN UPCOMING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A POSSIBLE ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>WHEN PM/B\'S AMBASSADOR LINO VISITS ZAGREB NEXT WEEK.  THEY </p><p>WERE A BIT DEFLATED BY OUR RESPONSE. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
