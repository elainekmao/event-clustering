<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 003138 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/K </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU, KN, KS </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTH KOREA TO OPEN EMBASSY IN KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>(C) During a courtesy call with the Ambassador on July 14, </p><p>ROK Ambassador In Kook Park stated that the GOK recently </p><p>agreed to upgrade the status of North Korea\'s existing trade </p><p>office to that of an Embassy.  This was in response to </p><p>repeated requests from Pyong Yang that peaked during the </p><p>fighting in Iraq.  Although he did not give a precise date, </p><p>Ambassador Park said the government of North Korea would be </p><p>opening its embassy in the near future.  Comment: Given the </p><p>number of North Korean nationals working in the State of </p><p>Kuwait (about 3,000, according to Ambassador Park), the </p><p>government\'s desire to establish an embassy here is </p><p>understandable from a practical point of view.  Our concern, </p><p>however, is that the move not prove a harbinger of a return </p><p>to the policy of active non-alignment practiced by Kuwait </p><p>prior to the Gulf War. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
