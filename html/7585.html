(U)  A VIGOROUS POPE JOHN PAUL II PRESIDED OVER THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S EASTER WEEK SERVICES, USING HIS HOMILIES AND </p><p>EASTER MESSAGE TO FOCUS GLOBAL ATTENTION ON THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>TOP INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS:  RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ, PEACE </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>VIOLENCE, AND THE NEED TO AVOID A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS. </p><p>THE POPE ALSO CAUTIONED AGAINST NEGLECTING LESS PROMINENT </p><p>CONFLICTS IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA.  HIS MESSAGES </p><p>REINFORCE THE VATICAN\'S FORWARD-LOOKING AGENDA IN THE WAKE </p><p>OF THE IRAQ WAR, AND ITS DESIRE TO REFOCUS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ATTENTION ON ITS BROADER AGENDA AFTER MONTHS OF INTENSE </p><p>FOCUS ON IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>REBUILDING IRAQ FOR IRAQIS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) IN HIS EASTER MESSAGE "TO THE CITY AND THE WORLD", </p><p>THE POPE EVOKED CHEERS FROM THE THOUSANDS IN ST. PETER\'S </p><p>SQUARE WITH HIS DECLARATORY STATEMENT: "PEACE IN IRAQ."  HE </p><p>URGED THAT THE IRAQI PEOPLE, "WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY," SHOULD BECOME "THE PROTAGONISTS </p><p>OF THE COLLECTIVE REBUILDING OF THEIR COUNTRY."  THE FUTURE </p><p>OF IRAQ WAS ALSO AT THE CENTER OF THE GOOD FRIDAY HOMILY -- </p><p>TRADITIONALLY PREACHED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE POPE BY A </p><p>PAPAL HOUSEHOLD PREACHER.  THIS YEAR\'S PREACHER, CAPUCHIN </p><p>FATHER RANIERO CANTALAMESSA, WHILE NEVER MENTIONING IRAQ OR </p><p>THE UNITED STATES BY NAME, QUOTED JOHN LENNON, JEAN-PAUL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01694  01 OF 02  221342Z </p><p>SARTRE AND ST. AUGUSTINE, AND ASSERTED THAT "EVERY NATION </p><p>HAS THE RIGHT TO GOVERN ITSELF."  CANTALAMESSA STRESSED THE </p><p>DIFFICULTY OF IDENTIFYING THE ENEMY "WHERE TERRORISM IS </p><p>CONCERNED."  HE ALSO OBSERVED THAT SOMEONE ONCE CRITICIZED </p><p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN FOR BEING TOO COURTEOUS TO HIS ENEMIES AND </p><p>TOLD LINCOLN THAT HIS JOB AS PRESIDENT WAS TO DESTROY THEM. </p><p>LINCOLN ANSWERED, "DO I NOT DESTROY MY ENEMIES WHEN I MAKE </p><p>THEM MY FRIENDS?"  THE PAPAL PREACHER THEN ASKED: "WILL </p><p>THAT GREAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FIND SOMEONE TO </p><p>TAKE UP THE TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE?" </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>REFOCUSING ON GLOBAL AGENDA </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE POPE\'S EASTER MESSAGE ALSO SOUGHT TO REFOCUS </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE "FORGOTTEN WARS AND PROTRACTED </p><p>HOSTILITIES" BRINGING SUFFERING, DEATH AND DESTRUCTION IN </p><p>VARIOUS PARTS OF AFRICA, ASIA, LATIN AMERICA AND THE </p><p>CAUCASUS REGION OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION "AMID SILENCE </p><p>AND NEGLECT ON THE PART OF CONSIDERABLE SECTORS OF PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION."  RETURNING TO ONE OF THE VATICAN\'S GREATEST </p><p>PREOCCUPATIONS, THE PONTIFF DECLARED THAT VIOLENCE AND </p><p>BLOODSHED IN THE HOLY LAND "WITH NO SIGN OF CEASING" WERE </p><p>CAUSING HIM "PROFOUND GRIEF." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE POPE REITERATED HIS CONSISTENT REJECTION OF </p><p>TERRORISM "WHICH THREATENS THE ORDERLY DEVELOPMENT OF THE </p><p>HUMAN FAMILY" AND URGED FOLLOWERS OF ALL RELIGIONS TO </p><p>PROMOTE DIALOGUE AND UNDERSTANDING AND TO WORK TOGETHER FOR </p><p>A "NEW ERA OF JUSTICE AND PEACE."   HE ALSO PRAYED FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01694  01 OF 02  221342Z </p><p>DELIVERANCE FROM "THE PERIL OF A TRAGIC CLASH BETWEEN </p><p>CULTURES AND RELIGIONS."  PRAYERS WERE OFFERED FOR ALL </p><p>SOLDIERS THAT "THEY WOULD NOURISH IN THE MINDS AND HEARTS </p><p>THOUGHTS OF PEACE AND NOT VENGEANCE" AND THAT THEY WORK FOR </p><p>"RECONSTRUCTION AND LIFE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE VATICAN\'S BROAD INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS ALSO </p><p>FOUND AN ECHO IN THE SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE GOOD </p><p>FRIDAY STATIONS OF THE CROSS CEREMONY AT ROME\'S COLISEUM. </p><p>THOSE CARRYING THE CROSS IN PROCESSION AROUND THE COLISEUM </p><p>INCLUDED A WOMAN FROM COLOMBIA, MEN FROM SIERRA LEONE AND </p><p>LIBERIA, FRANCISCAN FRIARS FROM THE HOLY LAND, AND AN </p><p>ENGAGED COUPLE AND A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER WHO HAD FLED </p><p>IRAQ BEFORE THE WAR BEGAN.  INTRODUCING THE SERVICE, THE </p><p>POPE IMPLORED GOD\'S ATTENTION TO "THE BLOOD SHED BY THE </p><p>MANY VICTIMS OF HATRED, WAR AND TERRORISM." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.
