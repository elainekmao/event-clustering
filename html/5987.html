<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 MONTREAL 000266 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE  BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, KFRD, KWMN, ELAB, SMIG, PREF, PHUM, Trafficking, Smuggling </p><p>SUBJECT: TRAFFICKING VIOLATIONS: SEX AND SMUGGLING IN QUEBEC </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: MONTREAL, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS "THE </p><p>PARIS OF THE WEST," HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A REPUTATION IN THE </p><p>SEX-TOURISM INDUSTRY AS "THE BANGKOK OF THE WEST." NOT </p><p>SURPRISINGLY, MOST TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS IN QUEBEC PROVINCE </p><p>INVOLVES WOMEN WHO ARE TRAFFICKED INTO THE SEX TRADE.  IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 2003, MONTREAL POLICE BROKE UP A JUVENILE </p><p>PROSTITUTION RING IN WHICH MINOR GIRLS WERE BEING FORCED TO </p><p>ENGAGE IN NUDE DANCING AND PROSTITUTION. MONTREAL POLICE </p><p>CONTACTS REPORT THAT AFTER THEY STARTED TO CRACK DOWN ON </p><p>PROSTITUTION AND SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF MINORS, MANY RINGS </p><p>MOVED BUSINESS OUT OF MONTREAL TO QUEBEC CITY AND NIAGARA </p><p>FALLS. IN ADDITION TO TRAFFICKING FOR THE SEX TRADE, U.S. </p><p>AND CANADIAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS HAVE SEEN INCREASED </p><p>SMUGGLING IN PERSONS--SOME OF WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED </p><p>TRAFFICKING--FROM COSTA RICA, MEXICO, CHINA, AND RUSSIA. </p><p>LOCAL, PROVINCIAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE </p><p>ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN COMBATING ALL FORMS OF TRAFFICKING IN </p><p>THE PROVINCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE QUEBEC-BASED SEX TRADE. "LET YOUR FINGERS DO </p><p>THE WALKING," BELL\'S YELLOW PAGES MOTTO HAS A DOUBLE </p><p>ENTENDRE WHEN IT COMES TO THE 20 PAGES OF ADVERTISING FOR </p><p>ESCORT AGENCIES IN THE 2003 PHONE BOOK.  THESE ADS, UP FROM </p><p>17 PAGES IN 2002 AND 2 IN 1998, HIGHLIGHT WHAT A BIG </p><p>BUSINESS THE SEX TRADE HAS BECOME IN QUEBEC. WHILE THE </p><p>CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA PROHIBITS SOLICITING FOR THE </p><p>PURPOSES OF PROSTITUTION, KEEPING A "BAWDY HOUSE" AND </p><p>"PROCURING AND LIVING OFF THE INCOME OF PROSTITUTION," </p><p>ESCORT AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO MANEUVER AROUND REGULATIONS. </p><p>ASIDE FROM ESCORT AGENCIES, QUEBEC IS KNOWN FOR NUMEROUS </p><p>STRIP CLUBS WHERE, UNLIKE IN THE UNITED STATES, CLIENTS CAN </p><p>TOUCH THE DANCERS. MANY TRACE THE GROWING SEX INDUSTRY IN </p><p>QUEBEC TO A 1999 CANADIAN SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT </p><p>LEGALIZED "CONTACT DANCING," WHEREBY CUSTOMERS IN STRIP </p><p>CLUBS ARE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THE BREASTS, BUTTOCKS, AND THIGHS </p><p>OF THE DANCERS. ACCORDING TO A 2002 ARTICLE IN THE GAZETTE, </p><p>THESE LAP DANCES, OR PRIVATE CUBICLE ENCOUNTERS, SELL FOR </p><p>AROUND $10 A PIECE AND BRING IN ABOUT 50% MORE REVENUES FOR </p><p>CLUBS THAN THEY EARNED BEFORE THE 1999 LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A PROFILE OF THE VICTIMS. WHILE MANY OF THE WOMEN </p><p>WHO WORK FOR STRIP CLUBS AND ESCORT AGENCIES DO SO </p><p>WILLINGLY, INVESTIGATIONS AND ARRESTS OVER THE PAST YEAR </p><p>HAVE UNCOVERED HUNDREDS WHO ARE COERCED INTO THE BUSINESS. </p><p>WHEN ASKED FOR A PROFILE OF THE GIRLS HE ENCOUNTERS, A </p><p>MONTREAL POLICE INVESTIGATOR THAT POST INTERVIEWED DESCRIBED </p><p>THE FOLLOWING SCENARIO.  VULNERABLE RUNAWAY GIRLS, MANY OF </p><p>WHOM ARE MINORS, MEET MEN WHO OFFER THEM FOOD AND SHELTER. </p><p>THEN, IT IS "PAYBACK TIME."  THE MEN REQUEST THAT THE GIRLS </p><p>BECOME DANCERS IN STRIP CLUBS. IF THE GIRLS PROTEST, THEY </p><p>ARE TOLD THAT THEY OWE THE MEN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THE </p><p>INVESTMENT THEY HAVE MADE BY TAKING CARE OF THEM.  THE </p><p>CARETAKERS THEN ACQUIRE FALSE IDENTITY CARDS FOR THE GIRLS </p><p>TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE OVER 18 AND SET THEM UP IN BARS AND </p><p>CLUBS THROUGHOUT QUEBEC AND IN NIAGARA FALLS. ONE GIRL </p><p>REPORTED THAT SHE EARNED $300-$400 A DAY, BUT WAS ONLY GIVEN </p><p>$25-$50 OF HER EARNINGS. THIS SCENARIO MATCHES THAT OF THE </p><p>JUVENILE PROSTITUTION RING BROKEN UP BY MONTREAL POLICE IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 2003.  THE GAZETTE REPORTED THAT THE TWO </p><p>RINGLEADERS WOULD BEGIN BY DATING THE GIRLS AND BECOMING </p><p>THEIR LOVERS, AND THEN FORCE THEM TO STRIP IN BARS IN </p><p>MONTREAL AND TORONTO.  WHEN DANCING DID NOT GENERATE ENOUGH </p><p>REVENUES, THE GIRLS WERE PUSHED INTO PROSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) POST\'S POLICE CONTACT REPORTED THAT MOST OF THE </p><p>GIRLS HE ENCOUNTERS ARE CANADIAN. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO </p><p>OTHER POST CONTACTS, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW CASES OVER THE </p><p>PAST YEAR IN WHICH FOREIGN WOMEN AND GIRLS WERE TRAFFICKED </p><p>TO QUEBEC FOR THE SEX TRADE. IN ONE CASE, TWO RUSSIAN WOMEN </p><p>WERE BROUGHT TO CANADA FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF NUDE </p><p>DANCING AND PROSTITUTION.  IN ANOTHER CASE, AN INDIAN WOMAN </p><p>TRAFFICKED TWO MINORS INTO CANADA FOR PROSTITUTION. </p><p>ACCORDING TO A CANADIAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL, THE WOMAN WAS </p><p>APPREHENDED AND SENTENCED TO TWO YEARS IN PRISON BEFORE </p><p>BEING DEPORTED TO INDIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) WHO ARE THE RINGLEADERS?  MOTORCYCLE GANGS ARE THE </p><p>KINGPINS BEHIND PROSTITUTION, STRIP CLUBS, AND ESCORT </p><p>AGENCIES IN QUEBEC.  ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SERVICE CANADA 2002 REPORT, THE HELLS ANGELS ARE THE LARGEST </p><p>AND MOST CRIMINALLY ACTIVE OUTLAW MOTORCYCLE GANG IN CANADA </p><p>WITH 35 FULL CHAPTERS. IN ORDER TO HAVE GIRLS PLACED IN </p><p>CLUBS AND AGENCIES, OTHER HAITIAN, ASIAN, AND RUSSIAN GANG </p><p>MEMBERS TEND TO USE THE MOTORCYCLE GANGS AS MIDDLEMEN. WITH </p><p>INCREASED POLICE ATTENTION ON THE MONTREAL SCENE (WITHIN THE </p><p>PAST SIX MONTHS, MONTREAL POLICE HAVE SET UP A TASK FORCE ON </p><p>JUVENILE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION), THESE GANGS ARE EXPANDING </p><p>INTO MARKETS IN QUEBEC CITY, OTTAWA, AND TORONTO. IN 2002- </p><p>2003, POLICE HAVE SEEN A RAMPANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF </p><p>GIRLS BEING SENT FROM QUEBEC TO WORK AS STRIPPERS AND </p><p>PROSTITUTES IN NIAGARA FALLS. THE HANDLERS TAKE LARGE CUTS </p><p>OF THE GIRLS\' EARNINGS, MAKING IT A VERY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS. </p><p>IN QUEBEC CITY, THERE HAVE EVEN BEEN CONFIRMED CASES IN </p><p>WHICH GIRLS HAVE BEEN SOLD FROM ONE HANDLER TO ANOTHER. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU)  PROTECTION EFFORTS. ON JULY 28, 2002, CANADA </p><p>AMENDED THE CRIMINAL CODE AND THE CANADA EVIDENCE ACT TO </p><p>ENHANCE THE PROTECTION OF MINORS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL </p><p>EXPLOITATION. THE LEGISLATION IS ONE STEP IN SATISFYING </p><p>CANADA\'S COMMITMENT TO THE JANUARY 2002 UN PROTOCOL ON THE </p><p>RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL, THERE ARE </p><p>SEVERAL SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, FUNDED BY PRIVATE AND </p><p>PUBLIC SOURCES, THAT OFFER PROTECTION TO YOUNG WOMEN </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE SEX TRADE.  ONE ORGANIZATION IN MONTREAL, </p><p>"PASSAGES" IS A SHELTER FOR 18- TO 30-YEAR OLD WOMEN. MANY </p><p>OF THE WOMEN WHO COME TO THE SHELTER ARE INVOLVED IN DRUGS </p><p>AND PROSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, A PASSAGES EMPLOYEE STATED THAT </p><p>SHE RARELY SEES THE YOUNG WOMEN INVOLVED IN SEX TRAFFICKING </p><p>RINGS; SHE SPECULATED THAT THE HANDLERS OF THESE WOMEN </p><p>MONITOR THEIR ACTIVITIES CLOSELY AND PREVENT THEM FROM </p><p>ACCESSING AVAILABLE SOCIAL SERVICES. IN THE OPINION OF </p><p>POST\'S POLICE CONTACT, ONCE GIRLS ARE BROUGHT INTO A </p><p>TRAFFICKING RING, THEY FACE A SLIPPERY SLOPE. VULNERABLE </p><p>GIRLS, DRAWN TO OFFERS OF PROTECTION AND CARE, OFTEN THINK </p><p>THEY ARE IN LOVE WITH THEIR "PROTECTOR."  COERCED INTO NUDE </p><p>DANCING, THEN PROSTITUTION, THE GIRLS QUICKLY BECOME PART OF </p><p>A SEAMY WORLD IN WHICH DRUG USE AND ADDICTION IS PREVALENT. </p><p>NEEDING INCOME TO SUPPORT THEIR DRUG HABITS, MANY GIRLS FIND </p><p>IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO BREAK OUT OF THE SEX TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) SMUGGLING. IN 2002-2003, U.S. AND CANADIAN </p><p>IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO SEEN CASES OF SMUGGLING TO </p><p>AND THROUGH CANADA, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS </p><p>"TRAFFICKING." MEXICANS, COSTA RICANS, CHINESE, AND RUSSIANS </p><p>HAVE BEEN THE MAIN ORGANIZERS. IN 2002-2003, NUMEROUS </p><p>MEXICANS FILED CLAIMS FOR REFUGEE STATUS IN CANADA AFTER </p><p>HAVING BEEN SMUGGLED ONTO FLIGHTS TO MONTREAL.  TO DATE, THE </p><p>ORGANIZERS BEHIND THIS RING HAVE NOT BEEN APPREHENDED.  IN </p><p>ANOTHER CONTINUING CASE, VARIOUS GROUPS OF COSTA RICANS HAVE </p><p>BEEN TRAVELING TO CANADA ON FALSIFIED CANADIAN VISAS. AFTER </p><p>ARRIVING IN CANADA, THEY PROCEED TO A SECLUDED PART OF THE </p><p>U.S.-CANADA BORDER AND FLEE TO THE U.S. SIDE. THIS OPERATION </p><p>HAD BECOME SO ORGANIZED THAT SOME OF THE GROUPS WERE MET AT </p><p>THE AIRPORT BY TOUR BUSES WHICH DROVE THEM TO THE BORDER. </p><p>WHILE THE ROYAL MOUNTED CANADIAN POLICE RECENTLY ARRESTED </p><p>THE KINGPIN OF THIS OPERATION, INTELLIGENCE REPORTS WARN OF </p><p>AN ONGOING BATTLE WITH COSTA RICAN SMUGGLING.  IN OTHER </p><p>INSTANCES, IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS APPREHENDED NUMEROUS </p><p>CHINESE CITIZENS TRAVELING AS IMPOSTERS ON JAPANESE </p><p>PASSPORTS. EACH PERSON REPORTEDLY PAID UP TO $30,000 FOR </p><p>HIS/HER FAKE PASSPORT.  OFTEN TO GUARANTEE FULL PAYMENT, THE </p><p>ORGANIZERS WOULD HOLD THE CUSTOMERS\' FAMILIES HOSTAGE IN </p><p>CHINA OR SUBJECT THEM TO FORCED LABOR. FINALLY, A CASE THAT </p><p>IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION INVOLVES A RUSSIAN DUO </p><p>SUSPECTED OF SMUGGLING ALIENS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES FROM </p><p>CANADA TO THE UNITED STATES BY HIDING THEM INSIDE A TRACTOR </p><p>TRAILER TRUCK. THE DUO CHARGES EACH FOREIGN NATIONAL $3,000 </p><p>AND TRANSPORTS 3-10 PEOPLE TO THE UNITED STATES ON EACH </p><p>TRIP.  IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS ARE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THESE </p><p>MEN. </p><p> </p><p>POLICE CONTACT: AGENT SERGE MORIN (YOUTH AND STREET GANGS </p><p>PORTFOLIO) </p><p>ALLEN </p><p></p></div>
