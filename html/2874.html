<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001407 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 5/6/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, MOPS, PREL, LI, SL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LIBERIAN SANCTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 80494 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In the absence of Foreign Minister Lamido, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter delivered talking points to Special </p><p>Presidential Advisor Ad\'obe Obe. The Ambassador </p><p>stressed the importance of keeping pressure on Taylor </p><p>who remained unrepentant in practice notwithstanding </p><p>the nice sounds he made in public. Instead of cutting </p><p>the RUF loose, Taylor still appeared to be harboring </p><p>and abetting hard-line RUF elements. This continued </p><p>association between Taylor and RUF miscreants could </p><p>generate nothing but continued trouble for the sub- </p><p>region. With the Sierra Leonean peace process at such </p><p>a critical juncture, it would be counterproductive to </p><p>give Taylor what amounted to a passing grade when he </p><p>had not changed his stripes. If ECOWAS countries </p><p>failed to support Resolution 1343 and continued </p><p>pressure on the GOL, Taylor would be the winner and </p><p>ECOWAS the loser. The rest of the world simply would </p><p>not understand why the countries of the region were </p><p>reluctant to keep sanctions on a leader who had </p><p>brought so much grief, destruction and death to their </p><p>own neighborhood, the Ambassador emphasized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Responding positively to the demarche, Obe </p><p>stated that Nigeria had previously backed the </p><p>sanctions and he saw no reason why it should change </p><p>its vote. He stated that he would call Nigerian </p><p>PermRep Mbanefo to discuss the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) With ECOWAS ExSec Chambas and Deputy ExSec </p><p>Diarra also out of town, the Ambassador delivered </p><p>points to Military Advisor Col. Dikkio, the highest- </p><p>ranking ECOWAS official available. Dikkio stated that </p><p>he had visited Liberia as part of the ECOWAS fact- </p><p>finding team to assess Liberian compliance with </p><p>sanctions. The mission concluded the Taylor government </p><p>was not fully compliant with all aspects of the </p><p>sanctions regime but the Monrovia government had made </p><p>improvements on regulating the diamond trade and in </p><p>curtailing unregistered air traffic. When the </p><p>Ambassador mentioned the mysterious airplane crash </p><p>amid suspicions of arms trafficking earlier this year </p><p>and Taylor\'s continued involvement with the RUF, </p><p>Dikkio could not respond. Dikkio did state that the </p><p>Secretariat believed the sanctions should be lifted to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>enable the GOL to fight the LURD and to alleviate the </p><p>economic burden on the common Liberian. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador replied that Taylor teamed with the </p><p>RUF presented a much stronger threat to the sub-region </p><p>than the LURD posed to Taylor. (Dikkio agreed that </p><p>Taylor was purposefully overestimating the LURD </p><p>threat.) Also, the Liberia\'s economy was not depressed </p><p>because of the sanctions but due to Taylor\'s avarice </p><p>and his running Liberia more like an armed camp than a </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador stated that now was not the time </p><p>to reward Taylor, especially with Sierra Leone at such </p><p>a critical crossroads in its recovery. ECOWAS support </p><p>for lifting the sanctions would diminish ECOWAS\'s </p><p>standing in the international community, he asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In the end, Dikkio replied that ECOWAS was </p><p>suffering from "Liberia fatigue," implying that </p><p>lifting the sanctions would be a way to appease and </p><p>make peace with Taylor. The Ambassador urged ECOWAS </p><p>not to throw in the towel.  Peace could not come by </p><p>giving Taylor freer license but in keeping him under </p><p>pressure and containing him. Peace and stability in </p><p>the region ultimately depend on that. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
