<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 07 COLOMBO 000721 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS(FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PTER, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, EGEN, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY - MORE COVERAGE OF AMBASSADOR WILLS\' </p><p>4/24 REUTERS INTERVIEW ABOUT LTTE SUSPENSION OF TALKS AND </p><p>BALASINGHAM\'S REPLY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  COLOMBO 0714 </p><p> </p><p>1.  On April 21, the LTTE announced it was suspending peace </p><p>talks. In a letter to the GSL, the LTTE listed its reasons </p><p>for suspending talks as: its exclusion from the 4/14 </p><p>Washington Conference, problems with the ceasefire accord </p><p>implementation, and that GSL had not focused enough on </p><p>rebuilding the economy of the North and East.  On 4/24, </p><p>Reuters ran an exclusive interview with Ambassador Wills </p><p>focusing on USG reaction to this letter. The full text of </p><p>the interview was later released to the press (Reftel </p><p>Colombo 0707).  On 4/25, LTTE Chief Negotiator and </p><p>Political Advisor Anton Balasingham responded to the </p><p>Ambassador\'s interview on Tamilnet, a pro-LTTE website. </p><p>Sri Lankan media covered this exchange extensively.  While </p><p>news coverage of the Ambassador\'s comments and </p><p>Balasingham\'s reply were concentrated in the Tamil press; </p><p>English, Sinhala and Tamil media responded with extensive </p><p>editorial comment and many opinion pieces.  The main </p><p>editorial theme in all languages was the need for the LTTE </p><p>to heed the US and international community\'s words and </p><p>return to the peace process.  Usually skeptical opposition </p><p>ISLAND and ISLAND SUNDAY delivered predictably stronger </p><p>versions of the same message in editorial and opinion </p><p>pieces. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Television and Radio. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2. In their 4/26 newscasts, independent and government- </p><p>owned Sri Lankan telecasters (MTV and SLRC,) reported on </p><p>Balasingham\'s response to the Ambassador.  Independent MTV </p><p>reported, "LTTE once again rejects US call to lay down </p><p>arms," while government-owned SLRC noted, "Anton </p><p>Balasingham says that they have not deviated from peace </p><p>talks in response to US Ambassadors reaction to LTTE </p><p>suspension." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Newspapers. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>3. News coverage of the Ambassador\'s comments and </p><p>Balasingham\'s reply were concentrated in the Tamil press. </p><p>However, opposition English weekly, ISLAND SUNDAY, carried </p><p>an Agence France-Presse (AFP) story as its main headline, </p><p>"Balasingham softens stand on talks after US barrage" and </p><p>also carried the full text of Balasingham\'s Tamilnet </p><p>interview under the headline "LTTE responds to US </p><p>Ambassador" (4/27).  AFP excerpts: "The LTTE on Saturday </p><p>assured the United States that they were not scuttling </p><p>talks with Sri Lanka, two days after the US ambassador here </p><p>slammed them for suspending peace negotiations...Diplomats </p><p>here had seen the LTTE\'s sudden suspension of talks as </p><p>brinkmanship and hoped that the negotiations could resume </p><p>soon.... LTTE negotiator Balasingham sounded conciliatory </p><p>in his remarks in the Tamilnet website, but refused the </p><p>give up their weapons as demanded by the US." </p><p> </p><p>Several Tamil papers also reported on Balasingham\'s </p><p>response.  State-owned THINAKARAN (4/27) headlined </p><p>"Balasingham explains to US Ambassador that Tigers did not </p><p>pull out from Peace talks" and reported that the LTTE </p><p>motive was to give the government some time to make </p><p>decisions. Independent SUDAR OLI (4/26) noted, "\'Did not </p><p>withdraw from talks - It\'s only a temporary suspension\' </p><p>Balasingham replies to US Ambassador."  Independent </p><p>THINAKKURAL (4/26) reported, "\'Suspension of talks to </p><p>provide time to the government\' - Balasingham\'s explanation </p><p>to Wills\' comment." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Editorials. </p><p>----- </p><p>4.  **** Under the headline "Heed timely advice," </p><p>independent English Daily Mirror (4/26), commented that </p><p>Ambassador Wills\' comments "need not be taken by the Tigers </p><p>as a loss of face, but. a reflection of increasing loss of </p><p>patience by the international community and particularly </p><p>USA over the LTTE\'s shrewd manoeuvrings." The editorial </p><p>follows: </p><p>"While some diplomats play cloak and dagger games with Sri </p><p>Lanka even when they are asked to play umpire, American </p><p>Ambassador Ashley Wills has indeed come to play an honest </p><p>broker\'s role." </p><p> </p><p>"Here is the representative in this country of the world\'s </p><p>sole super power, but the trappings of such power has not </p><p>caused him to deliver blind sermons to us as has happened </p><p>with envoys of some powerful countries in the past, who </p><p>with their own agendas or having listened to the LTTE and </p><p>their apologists\' propaganda, would lecture us to no end." </p><p> </p><p>"Now at least the Americans appear to have understood the </p><p>game plan of the LTTE to blame everyone else except itself. </p><p>Ambassador Wills while acknowledging continuing </p><p>shortcomings on the side of the Sri Lankan Government like </p><p>it "must do a much better job of delivering services and </p><p>assistance" and "It\'s way too slow and bureaucratic," has </p><p>squarely put the blame on the LTTE for its intransigence." </p><p> </p><p>"Referring to Anton Balasingham\'s letter to Prime Minister </p><p>Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mr. Wills observes: "letter makes it </p><p>sound like it was only the mismanagement of previous </p><p>Colombo Governments that impoverished the south of Sri </p><p>Lanka, and that the devastation of the north and east is </p><p>all government fault. That\'s ludicrous. Successive </p><p>governments have made many mistakes, but if blame is being </p><p>distributed fairly, the LTTE deserves a great deal as well. </p><p>Its pursuit of an extreme separatist agenda, by violent </p><p>means, has severely affected not only the north and east, </p><p>but the rest of Sri Lanka too." </p><p> </p><p>"The forthright interview given by Ambassador Wills to </p><p>Reuters need not be taken by the Tigers as a loss of face, </p><p>but is a reflection of increasing loss of patience by the </p><p>international community and particularly USA over the </p><p>LTTE\'s shrewd manoeuvrings. We hope it will serve as a </p><p>timely warning to the LTTE. Mr. Prabhakaran holed up in </p><p>tiny Wanni should think twice before he turns his back on </p><p>this friendly advice from the US envoy." </p><p> </p><p>"It should especially reflect on the following lines of Mr. </p><p>Wills: "While the talks are suspended, we urge the LTTE to </p><p>reflect carefully on its own transgressions. Assassinations </p><p>of opponents, intimidation of Muslims, taxation without </p><p>representation, aggressive Sea Tiger behaviour and </p><p>continued child recruitment do not build trust in the </p><p>LTTE\'s intentions.\'" </p><p> </p><p>***** Typically skeptical opposition English daily ISLAND, </p><p>and weekly ISLAND SUNDAY offered editorial comment on 4/26 </p><p>and 4/27.  Under the 4/26 headline, "Hard talk can do more </p><p>than dollars" the ISLAND notes, "Had western nations read </p><p>the riot act to the LTTE on terrorism much earlier, the </p><p>history of Sri Lanka would have taken a different course </p><p>years ago."  Excerpts: </p><p>"American Ambassador, Ashley Wills did some much needed </p><p>plain hard talking in his interview with Reuters on the </p><p>decision of the LTTE to suspend peace negotiations with the </p><p>government." </p><p>"This straight from the shoulder stuff was much needed </p><p>because in the convoluted rigmarole of the LTTE spokesman, </p><p>Balasingham, to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe </p><p>announcing the decision to suspend participation, an </p><p>attempt was made to project that the LTTE was the aggrieved </p><p>party, sweeping under the carpet, their belligerency and </p><p>terrorism that took place, even while the Ceasefire </p><p>Agreement was in force." </p><p>"If Prabakaran, Balasingham and their cronies had thought </p><p>that they could twist the arm of the Americans and other </p><p>western powers with blackmail of suspending negotiations, </p><p>these words of Ashley Wills, a resounding slap, was the </p><p>answer. But this is not enough." </p><p>"Neither the Sri Lanka government nor the western powers </p><p>involved in the peace process should yield to this </p><p>blackmail of the LTTE. If the LTTE walks out of the </p><p>negotiations, they do so knowing well that they place at </p><p>stake international assistance very much needed to </p><p>resurrect the war ravaged areas of the north and east as </p><p>well as alleviating the suffering of the Tamils in these </p><p>areas." </p><p>"It is evident that only the western nations where the ex- </p><p>patriate Tamil community makes a living and sends money to </p><p>the LTTE war chest that can make the LTTE do their bidding. </p><p>Had western nations read the riot act to the LTTE on </p><p>terrorism much earlier, the history of Sri Lanka would have </p><p>taken a different course years ago." </p><p>"Plain hard talk by other western ambassadors could help </p><p>this country much more than the millions of dollars they </p><p>are willing to part with." </p><p> </p><p>***** The Opposition English weekly ISLAND SUNDAY continued </p><p>on (4/27),  "Call the LTTE bluff"  that  if the LTTE  stays </p><p>out of the peace talks, it "must realise and act on. that </p><p>while all Lankans will be losers in such an event, the </p><p>Tamils in the war-scarred northeast will be the biggest </p><p>losers."  Excerpts: </p><p>"It\'s time to call the LTTE\'s bluff. U.S. Ambassador Ashley </p><p>Wills made clear as early as April 2 that the Tigers, as </p><p>members of a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO), will not </p><p>be invited to the Washington meeting earlier this month to </p><p>prepare for the major donor confab in Tokyo next June..." </p><p>"The LTTE must understand that threatening to sabotage the </p><p>Tokyo meeting, undoubtedly with the intention of extracting </p><p>some other concession, possibly something on the naval </p><p>front given the most pressing issue of the moment, as an </p><p>inducement to persuade them to attend, is not in the </p><p>interest of Sri Lanka and most so not in the interest of </p><p>the Tamil people of the north and the east that they claim </p><p>to represent. If the Tokyo meeting is scuttled or postponed </p><p>that means that there will be no international money </p><p>quickly forthcoming to press on with the urgent task of </p><p>undoing the ravages of the war" </p><p>"The country desperately needs the money that will surely </p><p>flow after the Tokyo meeting and the Tigers know this well. </p><p>That is why they are trying to maximize the possibilities </p><p>of the current scene resorting to the gun-at-the-head </p><p>tactic. Colombo must not capitulate. The LTTE has for too </p><p>long worn a look of injured innocence which Ambassador </p><p>Wills tellingly exposed last week with some refreshing </p><p>plain speak." </p><p>"Uncertainty on whether the Tokyo meeting will be held as </p><p>scheduled in June or not will definitely affect high level </p><p>participation. More importantly, international confidence </p><p>in the likelihood of a honourable and durable peace being </p><p>achieved in Sri Lanka will be seriously undermined. What </p><p>the LTTE must realise and act on is that while all Lankans </p><p>will be losers in such an event, the Tamils in the war- </p><p>scarred northeast will be the biggest losers. So Russian </p><p>roulette of the sort that is now being played is not the </p><p>best route to the desired objective." </p><p> </p><p>***** Under the headline, "International community\'s </p><p>gesture," government-owned Sinhala Daily DINAMINA comments </p><p>(4/26) that because of the LTTE suspension of talks ".the </p><p>international community and the opposition have come to </p><p>agree on the peace process with the Sri Lankan Government." </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"There is a silver lining in every dark cloud. The silver </p><p>lining in the dark clouds created by LTTE\'s pulling out of </p><p>peace talks is now showing... The opposition had no clear </p><p>idea about the peace process... there were different views </p><p>on this and the LTTE... The general opinion of the </p><p>opposition on the peace process was never a clear one..." </p><p> </p><p>"But, no sooner LTTE pulling out was announced the </p><p>opposition unanimously decided that negotiations should </p><p>occur... The united opposition\'s standpoint that \'peace </p><p>talks should continue\' is a positive factor. </p><p>...International community is pressurizing the LTTE on </p><p>this...US, India and France...." </p><p> </p><p>"US Ambassador on the 24th has said that LTTE, should come </p><p>to the negotiations table if they genuinely represent </p><p>Tamils and that their facts are just magnified and </p><p>unacceptable... US Ambassador has also pointed out that SLG </p><p>alone should not be blamed for the violations of MOU.... He </p><p>has strongly criticized some LTTE acts... North east </p><p>destruction has been caused by Sri Lankan governments as </p><p>well as LTTE and he has emphasized that LTTE must return to </p><p>peace talks..." </p><p> </p><p>"Meanwhile, America stresses that LTTE should renounce </p><p>terrorism by word and deed. the international community led </p><p>by America says that Sri Lanka should be a democratic and </p><p>united country and no single ethnicity should be penalised. </p><p>This shows the irrelevance of the anti peace groups\' </p><p>calling the peace process an attempt to divide the </p><p>country." </p><p> </p><p>"With this decision of the LTTE, the international </p><p>community and the opposition have come to agree on the </p><p>peace process with the SLG.  These silver linings on the </p><p>dark clouds should be considered as blessings... all </p><p>parties should dedicate themselves to peace... then our </p><p>dream will be realized.." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>***** Under the headline, "LTTE cannot boycott </p><p>negotiations," independent Sinhala weekly LAKBIMA comments </p><p>that with the involvement of the international community, </p><p>"Sri Lanka\'s peace or war is not managed solely by Colombo </p><p>or Wanni."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"It is very important for LTTE to attend negotiations... </p><p>but they show as if it is of no importance to them... State </p><p>media also showed that it is the SLG that would lose if </p><p>Tigers pulled out from talks... But the public although </p><p>hard-bitten by the previous wars was not shaken. They knew </p><p>that LTTE cannot boycott talks..." </p><p> </p><p>"This was the exact statement of the US Ambassador Ashley </p><p>Wills... he said that their reasoning was not acceptable </p><p>and that they have attend talks...he stressed on the </p><p>importance of their coming to Tokyo peace talks... listed </p><p>child abductions, intimidation of Muslims......and said </p><p>that this behavior would not help build confidence on </p><p>tigers .... That the international community would respect </p><p>them if they renounced terrorism..." </p><p> </p><p>"Earlier, efforts were made to get the international </p><p>community in between the Sri Lankan government and the </p><p>LTTE... now not only they are here but they offer to advise </p><p>and guide if one party detours... we are not in a position </p><p>to blame anyone... this is what we have created... As we </p><p>once said, Sri Lanka\'s peace or war is not managed solely </p><p>by Colombo or Wanni" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>***** Under the headline, "\'Sri Lankan Government and </p><p>opposition agree on a solution through negotiations," </p><p>government-owned Sinhala weekly SILUMINA comments  (4/27): </p><p>"[the LTTE]  cannot opt for war as the Sri Lankan </p><p>Government has kept the international community abreast of </p><p>the real situation...." Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"...Several groups were blaming the peace process saying </p><p>that it attempts to divide the country... people in the </p><p>North as well as the international community push LTTE </p><p>towards peace... many analysts believe that this pulling </p><p>out is just in order to win some of their demands.....But </p><p>they cannot opt for war as SLG has kept the international </p><p>community abreast of the real situation...." </p><p> </p><p>"Analyzing the facts listed by LTTE, the American </p><p>Ambassador says that they are not acceptable... while </p><p>accepting the mistakes of SLG, he has pointed out the </p><p>serious violations of MOU by LTTE. But when terrorist </p><p>organizations opt for peace serious incidents can be </p><p>expected." </p><p> </p><p>"Without acting as opportunists, we all must realize tat </p><p>this we have come to a decisive point where we all should </p><p>solve this national crisis...." </p><p> </p><p>***** Under the headline, "Appreciating the American </p><p>Ambassador\'s statement," independent Sinhala daily </p><p>LANKADEEPA, commented (4/28), "the Tigers who call </p><p>themselves genuine representatives of the Tamils should try </p><p>and let these people reap peace benefits by returning to </p><p>peace talks."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"LTTE before asking the Sri Lankan government about its </p><p>good response to MOU conditions should ask themselves </p><p>whether their response to same had been positive... Can </p><p>they point their fingers at somebody else?  SLMM itself has </p><p>said that LTTE had more violations on their account... As </p><p>Mr. Wills very correctly points out SLG alone should not be </p><p>blamed for violations of MOU..." </p><p> </p><p>"Ambassador Wills has given an excellent response to the </p><p>resettlement issues and its slow progress... he said that </p><p>"Expectations on development in the </p><p>south as well as the north are very high... All Sri Lankans </p><p>should understand economic development takes time and it </p><p>would accelerate only in lasting peace; Sri Lanka has not </p><p>yet achieved that... And he further said that lasting peace </p><p>can only be achieved by attending the peace talks and not </p><p>by walking away from it... We too agree that Tigers should </p><p>know the importance of sticking to the peace talks and </p><p>discussing the issues faced by both parties..." </p><p> </p><p>"The fact that Tiger reasoning is not acceptable and blown </p><p>up... If lasting peace is achieved, highest benefits of </p><p>peace would be enjoyed by the suffering communities in the </p><p>north... The Tigers who call themselves genuine </p><p>representatives of the Tamils should try and let these </p><p>people reap peace benefits by returning to peace talks..." </p><p> </p><p>***** Under the headline, "US Ambassador\'s request," </p><p>Independent Tamil daily, VIRAKESARI (4/26) comments, "the </p><p>talks should continue with commitment for the sake of peace </p><p>and its benefits. In the meantime, the Government should </p><p>implement the decisions taken at the previous talks." </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"US Ambassador Ashley Wills has requested the Tiger </p><p>Organization to reverse its decision and to participate at </p><p>talks for the welfare of the Tamils." </p><p> </p><p>"Many including the President, Opposition Leader, JVP and </p><p>Sihala Urumaya criticized the LTTE pull out and Sihala </p><p>Urumaya called for the immediate commencement of the war." </p><p> </p><p>"Internationally there were comments and VIP\'s of many </p><p>countries including US and India had requested not to break </p><p>talks." </p><p> </p><p>"US Ambassador Ashley Wills has given his complete views. </p><p>He stated that he regretted the decision of the Tigers and </p><p>that they should review their decision and to attend </p><p>talks..It is not possible to rebuild a country that is </p><p>economically devastated in no time. North and East of Sri </p><p>Lanka are awaiting much economic development." </p><p> </p><p>"All the Sri Lankan governments are responsible for the </p><p>fate of North and East. US Ambassador stated that Tigers </p><p>are also responsible for the present economic position in </p><p>N&E. He said that Rome was not built in a day. Likewise it </p><p>is not possible to rebuild Kilinochchi or Trinco within a </p><p>day." </p><p> </p><p>"It should be noted that there were many good results. </p><p>Therefore, the talks should continue with commitment for </p><p>the sake of peace and its benefits. In the meantime, the </p><p>Government should implement the decisions taken at the </p><p>previous talks." </p><p> </p><p>***** Under the headline, "Talks must continue" independent </p><p>Tamil daily, THINAKKURAL comments (4/26), "From all corners </p><p>pressure is building up to commence the peace talks again." </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"No one needs to say that the ceasefire agreement is </p><p>broken. Necessity to put the peace program on correct track </p><p>is the order of the temporary suspension of talks. From all </p><p>corners pressure is building up to commence the peace talks </p><p>again." </p><p> </p><p>"Liberation Tigers should not pull out of talks. They </p><p>should attend the Tokyo </p><p>Aid Conference. The decision to boycott the Tokyo Aid </p><p>Conference was regrettable. The Tigers want to be treated </p><p>respectfully. My government understands that, said the US </p><p>Ambassador Ashley Wills, which is the US stand." </p><p> </p><p>"Not only the US Ambassador but also the US Deputy </p><p>Secretary of State Richard Armitage have expressed their </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>views that the US government will not hesitate to lift the </p><p>ban on LTTE and accept them as a political group if they </p><p>renounce violence." </p><p> </p><p>"The decision of the Liberation Tigers to pull out </p><p>temporarily from talks is appropriate.

Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"..Others, however, have a different view. They argue that </p><p>foreign policy has never been the LTTE\'s forte, and by </p><p>taking on the United States of America by criticising them </p><p>for being left out of the Washington aid talks last week, </p><p>they were taken up by the bold resistance of possibly, the </p><p>Iraqi Baath Party." </p><p>"They invited trouble from Uncle Sam, and Uncle Ashly Wills </p><p>let them have it in his interview with Reuters.

(4/27). Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"But let\'s stop the nit-picking, shall we. (For the benefit </p><p>of those who haven\'t been following our peace process </p><p>closely, any criticism of the LTTE is nit-picking and </p><p>betrays a shallow mind and supremely immature outlook)." </p><p>"US Ambassador Ashley Wills in a Reuters interview last </p><p>week aptly summarised the (long?) list of LTTE </p><p>transgressions. "Assassinations of opponents, intimidation </p><p>of Muslims, taxation without representation, aggressive Sea </p><p>Tiger behaviour and continued child recruitment," he </p><p>enumerated." </p><p>"Humph.
