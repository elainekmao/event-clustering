(U) Summary and Action Request.  The Honduran government </p><p>has requested support of the USG (and other donors) to </p><p>extend to June 2003 in its Paris Club debt service deferral </p><p>and changes in the methodology used for HIPC and Paris Club </p><p>debt relief and funding of the GOH\'s Poverty Reduction </p><p>Strategy.

(U) In an August 5 letter signed by the Minister of the </p><p>Presidency, the Minister of Finance and the President of the </p><p>Central Bank, the Honduran government updated the </p><p>international donor community Ambassadors on the actions </p><p>taken by the Maduro administration to date to improve </p><p>government finances and meet conditionality of its Poverty </p><p>Reduction and Growth Facility program with the IMF.  In the </p><p>letter, the Ministers indicated that after analyzing the </p><p>implications of the deterioration in government finances in </p><p>2001 and the miscalculations in the Flores government\'s 2002 </p><p>budget, the GOH took a number of steps designed to improve </p><p>tax collection, reduce public spending and make the </p><p>government more efficient.

(SBU) The letter included an attachment outlining some of </p><p>the difficulties the GOH has encountered in meeting the </p><p>obligations in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRS) </p><p>and the HIPC debt relief requirements.  The attachment ends </p><p>with an appeal to the donor countries to support the GOH\'s </p><p>requests for Paris Club debt service deferral through June </p><p>2003, for lowering the amount of debt relief assigned to pay </p><p>for poverty reduction projects, and for its efforts to reach </p><p>an agreement with the IMF on a new three-year PRGF program </p><p>by the end of 2002.  An informal translation of the letter </p><p>is provided in para 5.  An informal translation of the </p><p>lengthy attachment on the Poverty Reduction Strategy is </p><p>provided in para 5. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Begin informal translation of August 5 letter. </p><p> </p><p>Dear Ambassador Almaguer, </p><p> </p><p>The purpose of the following letter is to make you aware of </p><p>the actions that the Government of Honduras, under the </p><p>Maduro administration, has taken during 2002 to stabilize </p><p>Honduras\' medium-term macroeconomic outlook in light of </p><p>serious public finance problems. </p><p> </p><p>As the IMF confirmed during its visit in May 2002, public </p><p>finances significantly deteriorated in 2001 leading to </p><p>Honduras\' non-fulfillment in December 2001 of the </p><p>macroeconomic targets that had been agreed by the IMF and </p><p>the previous Honduran government.  The central government </p><p>deficit was six percent of GDP in 2001, while the </p><p>consolidated public sector debt was three percent.  These </p><p>deviations resulted in an unexpected situation for the new </p><p>government, especially since the close relationship between </p><p>the IMF and the previous government until the end of 2001 </p><p>had raised expectations that Honduras\' fiscal situation was </p><p>within the norms established under the IMF agreement.  This </p><p>situation severely limited our capacity to act over the last </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>To complicate matters, the previous government\'s budget for </p><p>2002, which was approved by the National Congress in </p><p>December 2001, did not include important spending </p><p>obligations and overestimated projected income for 2002 by </p><p>about 1.5 percent of GDP.  Our belief that there were </p><p>miscalculations was confirmed by the marked difference </p><p>between actual and projected tax collections. </p><p> </p><p>Conscious that this situation was totally unsustainable and </p><p>with the intention of orienting the country towards a medium </p><p>and long-term vision of fiscal stability, the Honduran </p><p>government implemented and is in the process of implementing </p><p>a number of corrective measures, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- Issuing Executive Decree PCM-005-2002 which contains a </p><p>series of austerity measures to reduce public spending and </p><p>save the government an approximately usd 12.3 million in </p><p>spending. </p><p> </p><p>-- Passage in Congress of the Financial Stabilization Law </p><p>which expands the tax base, reduces tax exemptions, </p><p>contemplates sanctions for tax evasion (including the </p><p>temporary closure of business), reduces import taxes to </p><p>discourage contraband, harmonizes tariffs with the rest of </p><p>the region and simplifies payment procedures for tax payers. </p><p>Unfortunately, prolonged development of the law and </p><p>discussion in the National Congress caused its </p><p>implementation to be delayed until July, thus delaying </p><p>improvement in tax receipts before then. </p><p> </p><p>-- After a long and difficult negotiation, the Honduran </p><p>government agreed to phase-in increases, over a four-year </p><p>period, in public school teacher salaries that were due in </p><p>2002.  Beginning in 2006, new salary increases will be </p><p>granted based on increases in the minimum wage.  This </p><p>agreement will help reduce steep annual salary increases for </p><p>public school teachers and will allow the discussion of </p><p>teacher\'s salaries to be included in the government\'s </p><p>unified salary policy in 2006. </p><p> </p><p>-- In July 2002, Honduran authorities began closing </p><p>businesses (note: temporarily) that were not paying sales </p><p>tax.  This is the first time that businesses have been </p><p>closed for sales tax evasion and we hope this measure will </p><p>help instill a culture of honoring tax commitments in </p><p>Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>-- In the second half of 2002, the Honduran government will </p><p>begin implementing new administrative procedures to improve </p><p>tax collection.  We will also conduct a study to re-engineer </p><p>the public sector.  The results of the study will allow for </p><p>greater efficiency and quality of service in the public </p><p>sector and at the same time reduce its size. </p><p> </p><p>-- We will soon submit to the National Congress a modern and </p><p>equitable Income Tax Law that will complement the expansion </p><p>of the tax base and the administrative simplification </p><p>process.  We will also review the Tax Code. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Ministry of Finance presented to the National </p><p>Congress for consideration a report on budget performance </p><p>for 2001 and the first six months of 2002.  The revised </p><p>budget was also published in the two Honduran daily </p><p>newspapers with the highest circulation. </p><p> </p><p>-- A new budget formulation policy was designed for 2003, </p><p>consistent with the IMF\'s budget transparency code, which </p><p>will eliminate global expenditures (note: large budget line </p><p>items which previously were left to the discretion of the </p><p>Honduran president to assign to different ministries). </p><p> </p><p>-- By December 2002, a comprehensive, coherent and </p><p>consistent civil service reform law will be submitted to the </p><p>National Congress. </p><p> </p><p>To complement the government\'s fiscal measures, the </p><p>government has made progress in other important areas to </p><p>create an environment that encourages economic growth, </p><p>including: </p><p> </p><p>-- The Honduran government has improved its institutional </p><p>framework by proposing to create the Supreme Accounts </p><p>Tribunal, instituting a new selection process for Supreme </p><p>Court Justices, implementing the new Criminal Procedures </p><p>Code, making government procurement more efficient and </p><p>transparent, transferring management of government </p><p>procurement to organizations like the United Nations </p><p>Development Program and the World Food Program, who are </p><p>improving prices and reducing the potential for corruption, </p><p>and working with the Anti-Corruption Commission. </p><p> </p><p>-- With the help of the World Bank and the IDB, the </p><p>government is committed to increasing private sector </p><p>participation in public services and infrastructure projects </p><p>and has begun the public bid process for a new cellular </p><p>system contract, selected port services, national mail </p><p>service and electricity distribution. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Poverty Reduction Fund Law was approved and </p><p>legislative reforms to strengthen the financial system are </p><p>close to being approved in the National Congress. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Central Bank of Honduras has instituted open market </p><p>operations to orient the market towards an interest rate </p><p>more consistent with the decreasing inflation rates </p><p>experienced in recent years and obtain monetary base growth </p><p>rate in line with the expectations of GDP growth for 2002. </p><p> </p><p>-- The recently approved Monetary Program for 2002 includes </p><p>measures to eliminate during July and September the </p><p>obligatory investments in government securities by financial </p><p>institutions, equivalent to three percentage points of local </p><p>currency obligations, and update the minimum capital </p><p>requirements for financial institutions.  In conformity with </p><p>the Monetary Transparency Code, an external audit of Central </p><p>Bank operations was completed for the first time. </p><p> </p><p>-- Reforms to the Insurance Deposit Law have been introduced </p><p>to the National Congress and immediate actions were taken to </p><p>confront two longstanding bank insolvency problems.  Assets </p><p>and deposits were also transferred from one problematic bank </p><p>to a stable institution.  Technical assistance has been </p><p>solicited from the World Bank to help the Deposit Insurance </p><p>Institution value the two intervened banks and formulate a </p><p>strategy for their sale over the next year.  In the short- </p><p>term, the IMF and the World Bank will assist in an analysis </p><p>of the financial system that will serve as the basis for </p><p>further consolidation of the financial sector. </p><p> </p><p>-- Implementing regulations for the Securities Market Law </p><p>have been issued to improve the functioning of Honduras\' </p><p>securities markets.  Technical assistance has been </p><p>contracted with IDB funds to issue implementing regulations </p><p>for the Insurance Law.  The Private Pension Fund Law will be </p><p>discussed soon in the National Congress. </p><p> </p><p>-- A program will begin in September with IDB funds to </p><p>improve the technical capacity of bank auditors in the </p><p>National Banking and Insurance Commission.  Basic and </p><p>advanced CAMEL training for Banking Commission officials, </p><p>with assistance from the IMF\'s resident advisor in the </p><p>Banking Commission, is also underway. </p><p> </p><p>-- The National Competitiveness Council, under the </p><p>leadership of the Vice President, was created to encourage </p><p>private investment in sectors that have the greatest </p><p>potential to generate economic growth. </p><p> </p><p>-- By the end of 2002, a project will be underway to </p><p>restructure the different institutions in the public sector </p><p>and reduce duplicative functions by government agencies, </p><p>eliminate excess jobs and in general terms improve the </p><p>provision of services by the public sector to guarantee </p><p>efficiency and efficacy in the assignment of financial </p><p>resources, public spending and better service to the public. </p><p>Before beginning this project, measures will be taken by the </p><p>end of the year to reduce the size of the public sector. </p><p> </p><p>The measures described above clearly demonstrate that the </p><p>Honduran government is committed to fulfilling its medium </p><p>and long-term macroeconomic goals by maintaining balanced </p><p>public finances, creating an environment to achieve high and </p><p>sustainable economic growth necessary to reduce poverty, </p><p>improving the efficiency and quality of public spending, </p><p>widening the coverage and reach of programs to reduce </p><p>poverty and social spending, eliminating the domestic </p><p>financing needs of the public sector and maintaining a </p><p>monetary and exchange rate policy in accord with the </p><p>requirements of economic growth and competitiveness for the </p><p>productive sectors. </p><p> </p><p>The Honduran government presented to the IMF a proposal to </p><p>establish a joint work plan for the rest of 2002: </p><p> </p><p>-- The Honduran government reiterates its commitment to </p><p>continue coordinating and working with the IMF in </p><p>preparation for negotiations by October 2002 of a new three- </p><p>year program beginning in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Honduran government confirms its decision to define </p><p>achievable goals within a reasonable timeframe to reduce the </p><p>public wage bill as a percentage of the GDP. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Honduran government is committed to take additional </p><p>measures to strengthen tax collection, either through </p><p>technical assistance by hiring auditing firms and/or </p><p>reducing public spending, to achieve a non-inflationary and </p><p>sustainable deficit with foreign resources available at </p><p>concessional rates. </p><p> </p><p>We hope that the IMF, international donors and other </p><p>multilateral institutions accompany the Honduran government </p><p>down this difficult road.  We are convinced that maintaining </p><p>a balanced budget is fundamental to achieving equitable </p><p>economic growth, reducing inflation and generating resources </p><p>to combat poverty. </p><p> </p><p>Recognizing that it is important that international </p><p>bilateral donors and multilateral institutions are informed </p><p>about Honduras\' current fiscal situation and the actions the </p><p>Honduran government has taken and will take to resolve the </p><p>fiscal situation, attached are copies of the reformulated </p><p>2002 budget, a document reiterating the Honduran </p><p>government\'s medium-term fiscal goals and a detailed </p><p>analysis of the current fiscal situation. </p><p> </p><p>End informal translation of letter. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Begin Informal Translation of Attachment. </p><p> </p><p>Introduction </p><p> </p><p>A crucially important element for any country is to have a </p><p>clear vision of its medium and long term goals, along with a </p><p>strategy for the design and implementation of the means and </p><p>actions that will allow the country to gradually close the </p><p>gap between the current situation and the long-term vision. </p><p> </p><p>In this sense, in 2001, the Government of the Republic of </p><p>Honduras developed the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) </p><p>which represents in and of itself both a commitment and a </p><p>shared effort between the Government and Honduran society. </p><p>At the same time, this strategy will serve as a general </p><p>framework so that the country promotes investment in </p><p>projects that are oriented towards the goal of reducing </p><p>poverty. </p><p> </p><p>In this regard, a concern of the current administration is </p><p>maintaining a macro-economic environment that promotes a </p><p>sustainable economic growth.  Macroeconomic stability is one </p><p>of the fundamental pillars of the strategy, without it, the </p><p>country will not be able to generate the necessary funds to </p><p>implement the priority investments defined within the </p><p>framework of the PRS. </p><p> </p><p>We should note that the main premises that make up the PRS </p><p>are sustained economic growth, with equity, macroeconomic </p><p>stability, and sustainable government finances. </p><p> </p><p>Within this conceptual framework, we present the medium and </p><p>long-term vision of the non-financial public sector (NFPS), </p><p>an analysis of the current situation in order to determine </p><p>the existing gap between the two situations, and the fiscal </p><p>policy measures that the current Government will implement </p><p>to close that gap and provide the optimal fiscal framework </p><p>to sustain the PRS. </p><p> </p><p>Medium and long-term vision (plan) for the non-financial </p><p>public sector </p><p> </p><p>To achieve the necessary conditions to reduce poverty, the </p><p>plan that the non-financial public sector needs to have </p><p>centers on four primary aspects: </p><p> </p><p>a) Maintain balanced public finances in order to avoid </p><p>inflationary pressures and reduce market distortions, thus </p><p>guaranteeing the growth of a more solid private sector. </p><p> </p><p>b) Generate the necessary financial resources to carry out </p><p>the programs designed to reduce poverty and social costs, as </p><p>delineated within the Poverty Reduction Strategy. </p><p> </p><p>c) Improve the efficiency and quality of public spending, </p><p>increasing the extent and reach of the programs designed for </p><p>social sectors. </p><p> </p><p>d) Reduce the amount of public financing using domestic </p><p>resources as much as possible to guarantee that the private </p><p>sector will have funds available to finance its productive </p><p>activities and generate economic growth and employment. </p><p> </p><p>This plan is based on the principle that the primary </p><p>generator of economic growth should be the private sector </p><p>and the role of the public sector should be focused on </p><p>social activities with the goal of poverty reduction, </p><p>establishing a regulatory framework for the development of </p><p>the private sector and maintaining the macro economic </p><p>stability of the country. </p><p> </p><p>Nevertheless, we need to keep in mind the fact that the non- </p><p>financial public sector is made up of diverse players which </p><p>we can group as: central government, social security </p><p>institutes, government owned companies and municipalities; </p><p>each one of these should define their own objectives so that </p><p>they may accomplish the goals set out in the global plan. </p><p> </p><p>Central Government </p><p> </p><p>The objectives of the central government should be: </p><p> </p><p>a.  Finance the deficit solely with foreign assistance </p><p>available at concessional terms to assure the availability </p><p>of domestic resources to meet the needs of the private </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p>b. Increase savings in the current account to raise the </p><p>funds required for the execution of infrastructure and </p><p>social benefits programs. </p><p> </p><p>c.  Control the growth of salaries in administrative </p><p>positions and functions that have no positive impact on the </p><p>delivery of services to social sectors.  This group has had </p><p>the most pressing impact on government spending in recent </p><p>years.  In this way coverage of services can be amplified </p><p>without provoking inequality in public financing. </p><p> </p><p>Social Institutes </p><p> </p><p>The objectives that social institutes should set according </p><p>to the established plan are: </p><p> </p><p>a.  Continue generating a surplus of 1.5 to 2% of GDP </p><p> </p><p>Public Companies </p><p> </p><p>a.  Public companies should generate surpluses of 0.5 to 1% </p><p>of GDP </p><p> </p><p>b.  Establish competitive tariffs for services to citizens, </p><p>using existing tariffs in other countries in the region as </p><p>an example. </p><p> </p><p>c.  Improve and expand service coverage. </p><p> </p><p>d.  Control spending growth, especially related to salaries </p><p>and payrolls. </p><p> </p><p>Municipalities </p><p> </p><p>Taking into consideration that the process of </p><p>decentralization will put municipalities into a more </p><p>preponderant role in the country\'s destiny.  Based on the </p><p>experiences of other countries in similar situations, </p><p>municipalities should work from a balanced budget in such a </p><p>way as the total expenditures are entirely financed by the </p><p>municipalities own income plus transfers received from the </p><p>central government. </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results </p><p> </p><p>The results expected upon completion of the outlined </p><p>objectives: </p><p> </p><p>a. Reach a consolidated net deficit for the non-financial </p><p>public sector of 0.0% GDP. </p><p> </p><p>b. The net deficit of the central government should be no </p><p>more than 2% of GDP </p><p> </p><p>c.  Finance the central government deficit entirely with </p><p>available concessional foreign funding </p><p> </p><p>d.  The rest of the non-financial public sector should </p><p>generate a surplus equal to 2% of GDP. </p><p> </p><p>e.  Reach annual inflation levels of 2 to 3% </p><p> </p><p>f.  Generate real economic growth no less than 5% per year </p><p>g.  Maintain stability in the monetary exchange market, </p><p>guaranteeing the Lempira maintains its competitiveness. </p><p> </p><p>h.  Generate a substantial reduction in extreme poverty, </p><p>keeping with the goals and indicators as defined in the </p><p>Poverty Reduction Strategy. </p><p> </p><p>Actual Situation and estimates for 2003-2007 </p><p> </p><p>In order to determine the need to take measures aimed at </p><p>achieving the objectives set out in the plan of the Poverty </p><p>Reduction Strategy, an analysis of the current situation is </p><p>presented which shows the different parts </p><p> </p><p>Central Government </p><p> </p><p>At the central government level, we have seen a decrease in </p><p>income through 2001, falling from 19.4% of GDP in 1999 to </p><p>18.2% of GDP in 2001.  For this reason, the government </p><p>presented to Congress the Financial Stabilization and Social </p><p>Protection law.  It is hoped these measures will increase </p><p>income to the Central Government to 20.2% in 2002.  After </p><p>2002, income will remain relatively stable with revenues </p><p>reaching 20.1% of GDP in 2007. </p><p> </p><p>On the expenditure side, there has been marked growth in the </p><p>last few years, reaching 25.6% of GDP in 2001 and an </p><p>estimated 27.2% of GDP for 2002. </p><p> </p><p>The main source of spending growth is the public sector wage </p><p>bill which has grown consistently in the last four years </p><p>reaching 10.5% of GDP in 2002.  Due to this fact and since </p><p>the projections have been elaborated under the assumption of </p><p>salary adjustments based solely on inflation, for 2007 we </p><p>won\'t have reached sustainable salary and payroll levels </p><p>related to GDP (less than 9%.) </p><p> </p><p>As a result of these tendencies in income and spending, it </p><p>is estimated that the central Government could meet its </p><p>objectives congruently with the public sector plan presented </p><p>earlier and with the fundamental principles of the Poverty </p><p>Reduction Strategy up to 2005, at which time the central </p><p>Government would generate a savings in their current account </p><p>equal to 1.3% of GDP and a net deficit of 1.6%. </p><p> </p><p>Additionally, it should be taken into consideration that for </p><p>the years 2003-2005 the projections indicate that the </p><p>central government will have to refinance the deficit by </p><p>emitting bonds (though this is not congruent with the </p><p>objective of reducing the crowding out of the private sector </p><p>and maintaining inflation at low levels) or by requesting </p><p>new external loans. </p><p> </p><p>According to these projections, the country will be counting </p><p>on money inflows on the order of $230 million yearly, a </p><p>figure the World Bank has established as adequate to </p><p>maintain a reasonable level of indebtedness for the country. </p><p>Therefore, financing this gap by additional external loans </p><p>could generate problems in the ability to sustain the </p><p>foreign debt. </p><p> </p><p>Remainder of the non-financial public sector </p><p> </p><p>In the rest of the non-financial public sector we see a </p><p>definite tendency towards a decline in income, after </p><p>reaching 14.5% of GDP in 1999 to an estimated 12.3% of GDP </p><p>in 2007.  This behavior stems from the continued </p><p>deterioration of incomes from the most important public </p><p>enterprises without any adjustment to the prices of their </p><p>services. </p><p> </p><p>This factor has been partially compensated by a declining </p><p>trend in expenditures by public enterprises, principally due </p><p>to the lack of investment; but after 2002, expenditures are </p><p>expected to increase considerably due to planned investments </p><p>in HONDUTEL and SANAA. In spite of being necessary for </p><p>modernizing and improving customer service this investment </p><p>had been postponed in previous years. </p><p> </p><p>In terms of surplus, we see that the rest of the non- </p><p>financial public sector could present a surplus of around 2% </p><p>of GDP, established as a goal of the PRS, until 2006.  This </p><p>surplus has shown a downward trend since 2000.  This trend </p><p>will continue until 2003, when the trend will reach the </p><p>point of inflection and turn towards moderate stability. </p><p> </p><p>Overall, the decreases in revenue by the rest of the NFPS </p><p>will not be compensated by the revenues to the Central </p><p>Government, resulting in declining revenues for the </p><p>consolidated NFPS.  Simultaneously, the expenses for the </p><p>rest of the NFPS, as for the Central Government, show a </p><p>downward trend; but not sufficient to counteract the drop in </p><p>revenues.  The NFPS is expected to be in deficit for 2001- </p><p>2005.  By 2005, the NFPS should reach its goal of a balanced </p><p>financial account.  (Chart shows deficit beginning late </p><p>2000, dipping and bottoming out in 2001 to 2003 then </p><p>reducing the deficit to zero in 2005 and then a surplus </p><p>after that. </p><p> </p><p>Conclusions </p><p> </p><p>From our analysis, it is evident that the measures taken </p><p>during the course of the current year are insufficient to </p><p>generate the conditions of fiscal sustainability required to </p><p>achieve the objectives of the Poverty Reduction Strategy. </p><p> </p><p>Some of the most relevant factors that the Honduran </p><p>Government face are the salary pressures generated by the </p><p>Medical Statute and Teachers Statute (Congressional statutes </p><p>requiring exorbitant salary levels for doctors and </p><p>teachers).  These factors have contributed significantly to </p><p>the constant increase in spending in the last few years.  It </p><p>is also necessary to strengthen the tributary administration </p><p>by reducing fiscal evasion and creating a plan for a </p><p>reversal of the downward trend in income for the rest of the </p><p>NFPS. </p><p> </p><p>Taking the necessary measures to confront the difficult </p><p>fiscal situation that faces the country is an undeniable </p><p>fact, especially if we consider the deviation between the </p><p>projections presented in this document and the macro- </p><p>economic framework of the Poverty Reduction Strategy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>             Comparative Table of the Deviations </p><p>                   with respect to the PRS </p><p>              Deficit of the NFPS as a % of GDP </p><p> </p><p>     Year      Projections    PRS       Deviation </p><p> </p><p>     1999           0.6        1.5       -0.9 </p><p>     2000           0.1         1        -0.9 </p><p>     2001          (2.6)      (0.8)      (1.8) </p><p>     2002          (2.5)      (0.6)      (1.9) </p><p>     2003          (2.5)      (1.9)      (0.6) </p><p>     2004          (1.7)      (0.7)      (1.0) </p><p>     2005          (0.2)      (0.3)       0.1 </p><p> </p><p>Note: Positive numbers represent a surplus and negative </p><p>number represent a deficit. </p><p> </p><p>Complementary measures in the implementation process </p><p> </p><p>In order to correct the deviations and close the existing </p><p>gap between the current fiscal situation and the medium-term </p><p>plan presented, the current Honduran Government has </p><p>identified additional methods for the short term in the </p><p>following areas: </p><p> </p><p>    Measures for strengthening tax revenue </p><p>    Reengineering Government Program </p><p>    Additional revenue enhancement measures </p><p> </p><p>Means of strengthening tax revenue </p><p> </p><p>In this area, the Honduran Government will emphasize the </p><p>enlargement of the tax base by exchanging information with </p><p>municipalities, large contributors and Ministries and </p><p>Decentralized Institutions.  Also, the government will </p><p>ll </p><p>conduct prompt audits to detect businesses that are not </p><p>registered (additionally eliminating the penalties for not </p><p>registering) and businesses that fail to pay taxes, and to </p><p>take steps that will instill a new tax-paying culture in the </p><p>country.  The recent initiative of closing businesses that </p><p>evade paying sales taxes is a clear example of this. </p><p>Additionally, we will be receiving technical assistance and </p><p>initiating a program of external audits to complement these </p><p>measures to combat tax evasion. </p><p> </p><p>As a complement to the actions leading to the expansion of </p><p>the contributor base, we will be submitting an equitable and </p><p>modern Income Tax Law to the National Congress for approval, </p><p>emphasizing tax simplification as well as the transformation </p><p>from a Sales Tax to a Value Added Tax effective 2004, </p><p>consistent with the best tax practices worldwide. </p><p> </p><p>Additionally, the DEI (note: Honduran tax authority) will be </p><p>restructured in order to strengthen the tax administration </p><p>and make it more efficient.  The DEI will be restructured </p><p>according to type of taxpayer, consolidating administrative </p><p>functions and clearly defining collection operations for </p><p>small businesses.  To complement this, new automated systems </p><p>for information exchange and the administration of the </p><p>taxpayer accounts are being established. </p><p> </p><p>Reengineering Program </p><p> </p><p>The objectives of the government-reengineering program are: </p><p> </p><p>    Evaluate the composition of the quality and technical </p><p>  capacity of government personnel to determine a uniform </p><p>  evaluation and position classification system with </p><p>  respective requirements for qualification. </p><p> </p><p>    Identify the processes and procedures employed in the </p><p>  performance of duties and provision of services and </p><p>  improvements needed to increase quality and efficiency. </p><p> </p><p>    Define and implement plans to reduce and rationalize </p><p>  each agency\'s funding. </p><p> </p><p>    Complete an institutional restructuring that will allow </p><p>  for a reduction in the number of agencies that comprise up </p><p> up </p><p>  the Public Sector and modernize their functions. </p><p> </p><p>We have elaborated the terms of reference and budget for the </p><p>re-engineering project.  With the support of the World Bank, </p><p>we will solicit an international bid in the near future, </p><p>with progress expected by the end of the year. As a </p><p>preliminary step, we have identified the necessity to reduce </p><p>by 21% (equivalent to 5,000 jobs) the number of governmental </p><p>administrative positions. </p><p> </p><p>Additional revenue measures </p><p> </p><p>In addition, the Government will be designing a set of </p><p>measures designed to improve tax collection that will be put </p><p>into effect in January 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Required support </p><p> </p><p>With everything shown here, it can bee seen that Honduras </p><p>has advanced considerably in its objective to achieve fiscal </p><p>sustainability and the medium-term plan for the public </p><p>sector, through the design and implementation of measures </p><p>for improvement of tax collection, modernizing spending and </p><p>improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public </p><p>spending. </p><p> </p><p>It is worth noting that the current Government is aware of </p><p>the need for a civil service framework law, which is why it </p><p>maintained a firm position during the negotiations with the </p><p>teachers.  The government expects similar pressures from </p><p>other unionized groups in the Public Sector will arise </p><p>(Social Security and HONDUTEL).  Facing this, the Honduran </p><p>Government considers reducing the expectations the other </p><p>labor groups have in regards to salary increases to be a </p><p>fundamental step.  Similarly, we have initiated the process </p><p>of drafting a Civil Service Framework Law, for presentation </p><p>to the National Congress.  This law will emphasize </p><p>compensation systems based on inflation and efficiency. </p><p> </p><p>To reach the medium and long-term plan for public finances </p><p>and in order to achieve the objectives established in the </p><p>Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Honduran Government requests </p><p>the support of its allies and multilateral organizations in </p><p>the following ways: </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Receive an extension on Paris Club debt deferral until </p><p>     June 2003, at which time we hope to reach the HIPC </p><p>     completion point. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Allow the traditional relief received from the Paris </p><p>     Club to be used for budgetary relief, as has been done since </p><p>     1991 when the framework was negotiated in the Paris Club for </p><p>     the first time, and that the debt relief received under the </p><p>     HIPC initiative be used to finance projects in the Poverty </p><p>     Reduction Strategy. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Include the costs that the government incurs in </p><p>     increasing the coverage of services in the areas of health, </p><p>     education and security as part of the expenses to be </p><p>     financed with HIPC relief funds for a three-year period, </p><p>     after which they will become a part of the normal expenses </p><p>     anticipated by the Government and financed with domestic </p><p>     funds. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Support the efforts of the Honduran Government to </p><p>     improve its public finances and achieve a three-year </p><p>     agreement with the International Monetary Fund by the end of </p><p>     this year. </p><p> </p><p>End informal translation of attachment. </p><p> </p><p>ALMAGUER </p><p></p></div>
