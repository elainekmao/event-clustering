<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001012 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INL/AAE - EFLOOD; AF/W FOR CUNDIFF </p><p>LAGOS FOR DEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 6/10/03 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, KCRM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MEETING WITH MINISTER OF JUSTICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 856 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by: Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During a May 2 meeting to deliver the </p><p>non-paper on narcotics and law enforcement </p><p>certification to the Minister of Justice Kanu Agabi </p><p>(Reftel), Ambassador Jeter took the opportunity to </p><p>discuss the April elections with the Minister.  The </p><p>blunt, straight-talking Agabi decried the manipulation </p><p>and vote tampering that affected the elections in some </p><p>states.  Agabi opined that the electoral tribunals </p><p>should overturn some of the most egregious actions. </p><p>For the longer term, he said that the Independent </p><p>National Electoral Commission needed a major overhaul </p><p>to improve its political impartiality and technical </p><p>competence. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Minister Agabi thanked the Ambassador for the </p><p>congratulatory message from the White House to </p><p>President Obasanjo.  Agabi said Obasanjo was very </p><p>pleased.  Ambassador Jeter replied the United States </p><p>recognized the elections were occasioned by serious </p><p>irregularities in some areas of the country but still </p><p>the process yielded some positive results.  He pointed </p><p>out that Nigeria has a growing consensus on the </p><p>electoral law, there is now the beginnings of a </p><p>computerized voter roll, eligibility requirements for </p><p>political parties are now clear, voter turn out was </p><p>encouraging, and the conduct of the elections was </p><p>generally peaceful.  He pointed out, however, that </p><p>INEC needed significant reform, starting with the </p><p>appointment process.  (INEC National and State </p><p>Commissioners are appointed by the President).  Agabi </p><p>agreed but predicted INEC reform would be unlikely </p><p>because the election had further weakened the </p><p>opposition in the National Assembly that would have </p><p>been the element to advocate this reform.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter responded that "a PDP super majority in the </p><p>Assembly may not be such a good thing either."  The </p><p>Ambassador expressed hope the new National Assembly </p><p>would perform better than its predecessor.  He </p><p>observed that some of the newly elected lawmakers were </p><p>"reformers" who could improve the Assembly and that </p><p>the Embassy would try to work with them.  Agabi </p><p>responded by saying, "democracy is an experiment in </p><p>Nigeria, 75 percent of the resources are spent on 10 </p><p>percent of the people."  The National Assembly is too </p><p>large and the Cabinet is bloated with too many </p><p>Ministers, he asserted.  When asked to assess the </p><p>prospects for reforms in the second Obasanjo </p><p>Administration, the Minister responded that one of the </p><p>President\'s problems was that he followed the last </p><p>advice given; this was compounded by the fact that he </p><p>had too many advisors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador asked the Justice Minister for </p><p>his thoughts on the next President of the Senate and </p><p>Speaker of the House.  Agabi replied that under the </p><p>current arrangement of zoning key positions to </p><p>specific geopolitical regions, the Senate Presidency </p><p>would go to the Southeast, but he then complained </p><p>"there are no viable candidates from that region".  He </p><p>continued, "there are very inexperienced people in the </p><p>National Assembly.  They are often very active but on </p><p>the wrong subjects." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador expressed deep concern regarding </p><p>electoral irregularities and hoped the electoral </p><p>tribunals would look seriously at the results of </p><p>elections in several States, including Rivers, where </p><p>there were allegations of widespread irregularities </p><p>and fraud.  He recounted seeing photographs of full </p><p>ballot boxes that had been thrown into a ravine. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter also mentioned Cross Rivers, Anambra, </p><p>Enugu, Edo, and Plateau States as other places where </p><p>gross irregularities occurred.  He further stated that </p><p>the tribunals should look at the gubernatorial and </p><p>National Assembly contest or problems could be </p><p>expected, especially in the Southeast and part of the </p><p>South-South. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) At this point, Agabi said that he would </p><p>"insist" to the President that action be taken.  He </p><p>stated that there were "instances of gross malfeasance </p><p>because no elections were held in Cross Rivers". </p><p>"Crimes have been committed by high officials", he </p><p>asserted.  He also stated that there were similar </p><p>reports from foreign observers.  He commented that the </p><p>observers were invited to observe and their opinions </p><p>should be heard.  When asked if the President could do </p><p>anything about this, the Minister replied that he </p><p>would tell the President to instruct the Tribunals </p><p>that some election results should be thrown out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Agabi briefly mentioned the status of GON </p><p>efforts to recoup stolen government funds from the </p><p>family of the late Head of State Sani Abacha.  So far, </p><p>efforts to recover approximately 1.5 billion dollars </p><p>have been futile, Agabi said.  While the funds have </p><p>been frozen, the GON is no closer to getting them </p><p>returned.  Ambassador Jeter asked Agabi about the </p><p>assassination case of former Justice Minister, Bola </p><p>Ige.  Agabi\'s only remark was that the people </p><p>currently on trial were probably not the real killers, </p><p>an admission that he said he would not make public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
