<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000425 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>ROME FOR USMISSION </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREF, PREL, NP, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: BHUTANESE REFUGEE ACTIVIST DENIED BAIL BY SUPREME </p><p>COURT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  Nepal\'s Supreme Court has denied bail to </p><p>prominent Bhutanese refugee and human rights activist S.K. </p><p>Pradhan on the grounds that he is not a Nepali citizen, </p><p>affirming the decisions of two lower courts.  Named in a </p><p>complaint filed by a member of a rival refugee group, </p><p>Pradhan has been detained for more than five months </p><p>awaiting trial for the charge of conspiracy to murder. </p><p>Pradhan remains in good health and has been well treated, </p><p>he told Emboff by telephone on two occasions.  Post will </p><p>continue to urge Nepali officials to ensure that Pradhan </p><p>receives a fair and speedy trial.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Bail Denied After Blanket Complaint </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Nepal\'s Supreme Court February 20 affirmed the </p><p>decision of a lower court that authorities could continue </p><p>to deny bail to prominent Bhutanese refugee and human </p><p>rights activist S.K. Pradhan.  Pradhan, Secretary General </p><p>of the People\'s Forum for Human Rights and Development </p><p>(PFHRD), is being detained along with ten other suspects </p><p>pending an investigation into the September 9, 2001 murder </p><p>of R.K. Budathoki, the leader of a competing refugee </p><p>interest group, the Bhutan People\'s Party (BPP).  [Note: </p><p>Pradhan returned to Nepal September 5 after attending the </p><p>World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. </p><p>He was in Kathmandu at the time of Budathoki\'s murder. </p><p>End Note.]  A complaint filed by one of Budathoki\'s </p><p>associates named a total of 43 individuals as parties to a </p><p>conspiracy to commit murder.  Eleven have been taken into </p><p>custody, and warrants remain outstanding for the other </p><p>thirty-two. </p><p> </p><p>All the Way to the Supreme Court </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The District Court for Jhapa in eastern Nepal </p><p>ruled October 16, 2001 that because Pradhan is not a </p><p>citizen of Nepal, under the law he is ineligible for bail. </p><p>[Note:  Nepal\'s criminal code makes no provision for bail </p><p>for non-citizens.]  The Appellate Court in Ilam upheld the </p><p>Jhapa court\'s decision January 18, and the Supreme Court </p><p>affirmed February 20.  Pradhan was arrested September 19, </p><p>2001, and thus has now been held in detention without </p><p>trial for over five months.  Nepal\'s criminal law does not </p><p>limit the time a defendant can be held in detention </p><p>awaiting trial.  A local attorney who argues cases before </p><p>Nepal\'s Supreme Court told us that the courts could take </p><p>years to reach a verdict in Pradhan\'s case. </p><p> </p><p>Jailers: Speak Nepali, Please </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Emboff has spoken twice with Pradhan by telephone </p><p>from his jail cell in Jhapa, on November 19, 2001 and </p><p>again on February 25.  Speaking in the presence of court </p><p>officers - who object when Pradhan lapses into English - </p><p>on both occasions Pradhan stated that he has been well </p><p>treated by his jailers and is in good health.  Pradhan </p><p>also maintained his innocence, adding that he hoped </p><p>justice would prevail, and asked for U.S. Government </p><p>assistance to help secure his release.  Post maintains </p><p>regular contact with Pradhan\'s family, who continue to </p><p>lobby for his release from detention. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Prisoner of Languor? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The judiciary\'s reticence to grant bail </p><p>apparently squares with the law, but means that Pradhan </p><p>could remain in detention for months, if not years.  So </p><p>far, Pradhan\'s lawyers have concentrated on securing his </p><p>release on bail, and not on dismissing the blanket </p><p>complaint.  With appeals on the bail case exhausted, they </p><p>will now turn their attention to answering the charges in </p><p>court.  Post will continue to urge Nepali officials to </p><p>ensure that Pradhan is given a fair and speedy trial. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
