<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000947 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES/PCI, OES/STAS (NEUREITER/REYNOLDS), </p><p>WHA/CAN (RUNNING) </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR OSTP (GABRIEL & LEVINSON) </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, OFFICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (STEIGER) </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS TO PRESIDENT\'S COUNCIL ON BIOETHICS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, PHUM, TSPL, SOCI, KSCA, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CLONING AND STEM CELL BILL PROGRESSING WELL </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) 2002 OTTAWA 1706 </p><p> </p><p>      (B) 2002 OTTAWA 836 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. Bill C-13, "An Act Respecting Assisted Human </p><p>Reproduction," was introduced into the Canadian House </p><p>of Commons on October 9, 2002.  If enacted, it would </p><p>ban human cloning for both reproductive and </p><p>research/therapeutic purposes.  The legislation, itself </p><p>a clone of Bill C-56 (Ref A), which died when </p><p>Parliament was prorogued in September 2002, will </p><p>prohibit cloning, as well as regulate Assisted Human </p><p>Reproductive (AHR) activities and related research. The </p><p>bill would allow research on human embryos that remain </p><p>after fertility treatment.  Such use would require free </p><p>and informed consent by the parents, and would require </p><p>a government license.  To control activity involving </p><p>new reproductive technologies, stem cells and cloning, </p><p>the legislation proposes the establishment of a new </p><p>agency, the Assisted Human Reproductive Agency of </p><p>Canada.  The bill is expected to pass final muster in </p><p>the House of Commons within days and move on to </p><p>scrutiny in the Canadian Senate.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Legislation prohibits and controls many activities </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2. On October 9, 2002 Canadian Health Minister Anne </p><p>McLellan introduced Bill C-13 (formerly C-56) "An Act </p><p>Respecting Assisted Human Reproduction" into the House </p><p>of Commons.  It covers a number of controversial </p><p>issues, including access to embryonic stem cells for </p><p>research, cloning and surrogate motherhood. </p><p>The final House of Commons vote on Bill C-13, is </p><p>expected as early as April 3rd.  If passed by the House </p><p>of Commons, the bill will move to the Senate, where it </p><p>will face light scrutiny in the Liberal-dominated </p><p>chamber (which is characterized by its members being </p><p>appointed by the Prime Minister rather than being </p><p>elected through general elections). </p><p> </p><p>3. Prohibited Activities: The bill prohibits a number </p><p>of specific activities that must not be carried out </p><p>under any circumstances, including germ-line </p><p>alteration, animal/human hybrids and the </p><p>commercialization of procreation.  These prohibited </p><p>activities remain unchanged from the predecessor </p><p>legislation (ref A). </p><p> </p><p>4. "Controlled Activities", on the other hand, may be </p><p>carried out, but only in accordance with the </p><p>legislation and regulations.  The proposed law requires </p><p>that a license be authorized for any activities related </p><p>to maintenance/transportation/ or </p><p>importation/exportation of an "in vitro" embryo. (It is </p><p>interesting to note that proposed US cloning </p><p>legislation (HR-534 and S-245), in addition to banning </p><p>the commercialization of cloned embryos, also prohibits </p><p>the importation of medical therapies created from </p><p>cloned embryos.  We will be watching whether this will </p><p>have an impact on Canadian research efforts with </p><p>embryos. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  Bill C-13, like its predecessor C-56, describes </p><p>embryonic stem cell research as a controlled activity. </p><p>While the legislation bans cloning and also the </p><p>creation of embryos expressly for research, it permits </p><p>the use of "surplus" embryos for extraction of stem </p><p>cells.  In addressing this issue, Bill C-13 specifies </p><p>that licenses for such research may be issued only if </p><p>researchers can satisfy the Agency that pre-existing </p><p>embryonic stem cell lines or other means cannot be </p><p>substituted. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Assisted Human Reproductive Agency proposed </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. To enforce the Act, license and manage controlled </p><p>activities, such as performing research on surplus "in </p><p>vitro" embryos, the bill calls for the establishment of </p><p>the "Assisted Human Reproductive Agency of Canada." </p><p>Reporting to the Minister of Health, the agency would </p><p>have a broad mandate, including the collection, </p><p>analysis and management of a vast array of personal </p><p>information under the rubric of "health reporting </p><p>information." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. The Quebec-based Raelians\' December 2002 claim they </p><p>had successfully cloned a human being and that more </p><p>were on the way, provoked a media frenzy and </p><p>highlighted the pressing need for a law prohibiting </p><p>human cloning.  The timeliness of the bill, however, </p><p>does not shield it from critics; leading research </p><p>funding advocates such as the Juvenile Diabetes </p><p>Research Foundation (JDRF) are making a final plea to </p><p>parliamentarians to reconsider C-13\'s ban of </p><p>therapeutic cloning of any kind (cloning or embryo- </p><p>splitting) for any purpose, either reproduction or </p><p>research.  On the other hand, the Canadian Conference </p><p>of Catholic Bishops is urging MPs to strengthen the </p><p>bill, by amending it to prohibit research on surplus </p><p>human embryos.  Observers note, however, that </p><p>amendments to this bill, particularly in the context of </p><p>therapeutic cloning are unlikely. </p><p> </p><p>8. The complete text of Bill C-13, "An Act Respecting </p><p>Assisted Human Reproduction" is available at the </p><p>Canadian Parliament\'s website: www.parl.gc.ca.  Look </p><p>for C-13 under the rubric "Bills"; then "House of </p><p>Commons"; then "Government Bills". </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
