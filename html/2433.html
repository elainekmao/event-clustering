(C) SUMMARY: BETWEEN JANUARY 15 AND 18, ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY LORNE CRANER AND HIS DELEGATION MET WITH A </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WIDE SAMPLING OF ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT, OPPOSITION AND </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY REPRESENTATIVES.  A/S CRANER INFORMED TWO </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE LEADERSHIP IS IN THE PROCESS OF "PULLING THE </p><p>TRIGGER" OF US TRAVEL AND FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS. </p><p>MEANWHILE, THE GOZ TRIED TO DOWNPLAY REPRESSIVE </p><p>LEGISLATION RECENTLY PASSED BY THE ZIMBABWE PARLIAMENT </p><p>AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BY RULING PARTY SUPPORTERS. </p><p>OPPOSITION, CIVIL SOCIETY AND COMMERCIAL FARM </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES PAINTED A PICTURE OF A RAPIDLY </p><p>DETERIORATING HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION ON THE GROUND.  THE </p><p>GROUPS WITH WHOM CRANER MET WERE DIVIDED ON THE OUTCOME </p><p>OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SCHEDULED FOR MARCH AND ITS </p><p>AFTERMATH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>MESSAGE TO GOZ: YOU ARE PULLING THE TRIGGER </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEMOCRACY, </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND LABOR LORNE CRANER, HIS DEPUTY JOHN </p><p>SCOTT CARPENTER, S/P ADVISOR TOM CALLAHAN, AMBASSADOR </p><p>SULLIVAN AND POLOFF MET WITH SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT -- </p><p>AND ZANU-PF SECRETARY OF ADMINISTRATION -- EMMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA, WHO WAS JOINED BY CLERK OF PARLIAMENT AUSTIN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00284  01 OF 04  310830Z </p><p>ZVOMA AND MFA U.S. DESK OFFICER RICHARD CHIBUWE.  AFTER </p><p>INITIAL PLEASANTRIES, A/S CRANER POINTED OUT GROWING </p><p>U.S. CONCERN FOR THE DETERIORATING HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE AND THE RECENT PASSAGE OF </p><p>REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION BY PARLIAMENT.  MNANGAGWA REPLIED </p><p>THAT VIOLENCE ON THE FARMS HAS DIMINISHED CONSIDERABLY </p><p>AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW FARM INVASIONS SINCE THE </p><p>MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE "CLOSED" THE A1 RESETTLEMENT </p><p>SCHEME ON JULY 31, 2001.  THAT MAY BE SO, CRANER </p><p>RETORTED, BUT THE LEVEL OF POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED </p><p>VIOLENCE UNRELATED TO THE LAND ISSUE APPEARS TO BE </p><p>INCREASING.  THE SPEAKER BLAMED THE MDC FOR STARTING A </p><p>FEW ISOLATED INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE, TO WHICH ZANU-PF </p><p>YOUTHS RESPOND IN KIND.  ADDITIONALLY, THE GOZ DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE "YOUTH BRIGADES" -- IT SPONSORS A NATIONAL YOUTH </p><p>SERVICE IN WHICH YOUTHS ARE TRAINED AND DEPLOYED FOR </p><p>COMMUNITY SERVICE IN CLINICS AND SCHOOLS.  IT IS TRUE, </p><p>MNANGAGWA STATED, THAT THE POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE THEIR </p><p>OWN YOUTH WINGS, AND IT IS THEY WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>THE VIOLENCE.  REGARDING THE RECENTLY PASSED PUBLIC </p><p>ORDER AND SECURITY ACT (POSA), MNANGAGWA PUZZLED OVER </p><p>U.S. CONCERNS, SAYING THE LEGISLATION INCORPORATES </p><p>PROVISIONS FROM BRITISH AND SOUTH AFRICAN LAWS.  A/S </p><p>CRANER REPLIED THAT IT APPEARS THE POSA UTILIZES THE </p><p>HARSHEST ASPECTS OF THESE LAWS AND MADE THE POINT THAT </p><p>NO ONE WORRIES TOO MUCH ABOUT THESE PROVISIONS THERE </p><p>BECAUSE WHERE THE RULE OF LAW PREVAILS, HARSH PROVISIONS </p><p>CAN BE CHALLENGED.  IN ZIMBABWE, THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY </p><p>THE CASE ANY LONGER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) A/S CRANER STATED THAT WHEN A/S WALTER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00284  01 OF 04  310830Z </p><p>KANSTEINER MET WITH GOZ OFFICIALS LAST MONTH (REFTEL), </p><p>HE SAID GOZ ACTIONS WOULD DETERMINE WHETHER THE U.S. </p><p>ADMINISTRATION ENACTS TRAVEL AND FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS </p><p>ON ZIMBABWEAN LEADERS AS STIPULATED IN THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA).  SINCE </p><p>THEN, THE USG HAS SEEN ONLY A DETERIORATION IN THE </p><p>SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE; IN FACT, THE GOZ IS "PULLING THE </p><p>TRIGGER" OF U.S. RESTRICTIONS THROUGH ITS FAILURE TO </p><p>STEM POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND THE PASSAGE OF DRACONIAN </p><p>LEGISLATION.  MNANGAGWA REPLIED THAT THERE IS A GROWING </p><p>ANTI-U.S. FEELING IN THE GOZ; THE ZDERA IS A U.S. QUID </p><p>PRO QUO FOR BRITAIN\'S SUPPORT IN THE WAR AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM; AND THE GOZ CAN ONLY ACT IN THE INTERESTS OF </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE, NOT THOSE OF THE U.S.  THE </p><p>SPEAKER MAINTAINED THAT THE OLD LAW AND ORDER </p><p>MAINTENANCE ACT, WHICH THE POSA REPLACED, PROVIDED FOR </p><p>THE DEATH PENALTY FOR NINE OFFENSES -- THE POSA DOES FOR </p><p>ONLY ONE, AND THAT THERE ARE NO POLITICAL PRISONERS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, UNLIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\' UNDER SECRETARY </p><p>FOR EUROPE AND AMERICAS GEORGE VENGESA TOLD A/S CRANER </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE IS "ON TRACK" FOR A FREE AND FAIR </p><p>ELECTION, A MESSAGE IT HAS BEEN DELIVERING TO ITS SADC </p><p>PARTNERS.  A/S CRANER REMARKED THAT DESPITE A HISTORY OF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5562 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00284  02 OF 04  310831Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------5FDE10  310831Z /38 </p><p>P 310819Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0843 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 000284 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S CRANER MESSAGE TO ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT: YOU </p><p>ARE PULLING THE TRIGGER OF SANCTIONS </p><p> </p><p>BUMPY RELATIONS, THE U.S. DOES CARE ABOUT ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00284  02 OF 04  310831Z </p><p>THAT IT IS NOT IN LEAGUE WITH THE BRITISH TO UNDERMINE </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE TO SAY THE PRACTICES IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO DATE DO NOT FIT WITH THE DEMOCRATIC TRENDS </p><p>OF THE REGION.  BECOMING DEFENSIVE, VENGESA STATED "HOW </p><p>CAN YOU SAY THAT WHEN 57 OPPOSITION MPS WERE ELECTED IN </p><p>2000?"  THE MFA OFFICIAL THEN DEMANDED TO KNOW WHY </p><p>ZIMBABWE WAS BEING SINGLED OUT FOR SANCTIONS WHEN OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  "WHAT OTHER AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN SLAPPED WITH SANCTIONS IN THIS </p><p>MANNER?"  A/S CRANER RESPONDED THAT SOUTH AFRICA IN THE </p><p>1980S AND MORE RECENTLY SUDAN AND NIGERIA HAVE BEEN HIT </p><p>WITH MORE DRACONIAN SANCTIONS FOR SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ABUSES.  ZIMBABWE IS GETTING OFF RELATIVELY EASILY AS </p><p>THE ZDERA PROVIDES FOR MORE INCENTIVES THAN </p><p>RESTRICTIONS.  A/S CRANER ALSO DELIVERED THE USG MESSAGE </p><p>TO VENGESA, AS HE DID TO MNANGAGWA, THAT THE GOZ IS </p><p>"SQUEEZING THE TRIGGER" OF SANCTIONS.  VENGESA GLUMLY </p><p>STATED THAT HE WOULD PASS ON THE MESSAGE TO MORE SENIOR </p><p>GOZ OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>IMPACT OF ZDERA </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) A NUMBER OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND OPPOSITION </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES WITH WHOM THE CRANER DELEGATION MET </p><p>COMMENTED ON THE ZDERA.  CHAIRMAN REGINALD MATCHABA-HOVE </p><p>AND NATIONAL COORDINATOR RINDAI CHIPFUNDE OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE ELECTION SUPPORT NETWORK (ZESN), AN UMBRELLA </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF ZIMBABWE NGOS, OPINED THAT THE ZDERA AND </p><p>THREAT OF EU SANCTIONS HAD SOMEWHAT SOFTENED THE GOZ\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00284  02 OF 04  310831Z </p><p>HARSH ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WEST.  IN THEIR OPINION, THE </p><p>U.S. RESPONSE SHOULD BE ROBUST, AND AN INCREMENTAL </p><p>APPLICATION OF SANCTIONS ON LEADERS WOULD BE MOST </p><p>EFFECTIVE.  THE ZESN CHIEFS ALSO NOTED THAT SOME </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS STILL BELIEVE THAT THE ZDERA IMPOSES </p><p>ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON ZIMBABWE; MORE PUBLIC STATEMENTS </p><p>OR EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL ON THE LAW WOULD HELP STEM THE </p><p>CONFUSION.  MARY NDLOVU, A TRUSTEE OF THE LEGAL </p><p>RESOURCES FOUNDATION NGO, WAS MORE POINTED AND SAID </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WANT TO SEE THEIR LEADERS PUNISHED.  "WHY IS </p><p>IT TAKING SO LONG TO ENACT?" SHE ASKED RHETORICALLY. </p><p>PAUL TEMBA-NYATHI, THE MDC\'S ELECTIONS DIRECTOR, </p><p>DIFFERED BY SAYING ANY ZDERA RESTRICTIONS SHOULD BE </p><p>IMPOSED IMMEDIATELY TO LET THE GOZ KNOW THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FINDS ITS ACTIONS UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p>"WOULD THIS NOT LEAD TO A STATE OF EMERGENCY BEFORE THE </p><p>ELECTION?" THE AMBASSADOR ASKED.  NO, A DE FACTO STATE </p><p>OF EMERGENCY ALREADY EXISTS, TEMBA-NYATHI OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>CATALOGUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES GROWING </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE CRANER DELEGATION, ACCOMPANIED BY AMBASSADOR </p><p>SULLIVAN AND POLOFF, TRAVELED ABOUT 100 KM SOUTHEAST OF </p><p>HARARE TO CHIPESA FARM, WHICH IS OWNED BY MDC ACTIVISTS </p><p>IAN AND KERRY KAY.  GATHERED AT THE FARM WERE TWO OTHER </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS, FIVE FARM WORKERS, AND A RESETTLED </p><p>BLACK FARMER.  THE FARM WORKERS MATTER-OF-FACTLY </p><p>DESCRIBED THE NIGHTLY BEATINGS THEY RECEIVE WITH WHIPS </p><p>AND CHAINS BY ZANU-PF YOUTHS, THE BURNING DOWN OF THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00284  02 OF 04  310831Z </p><p>HOMES, AND THE CONSTANT HARASSMENT AND DEATH THREATS. </p><p>ONE WORKER HAD PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIS BACK WHERE HE HAD BEEN </p><p>STRUCK FOUR TIMES WITH AN AX.  THEIR CHILDREN DON\'T GO </p><p>TO SCHOOL AND OTHER CO-WORKERS ARE SO FEARFUL THAT THEY </p><p>SLEEP IN THE BUSH FOR WEEKS AT A TIME.  ALL THE WHILE </p><p>THEY ARE TOLD TO STOP WORKING FOR THE KAYS AND TO VOTE </p><p>FOR ZANU-PF.  MOST OF THE ZANU-PF YOUTH ARE BROUGHT IN </p><p>FROM HARARE OR FAR-AWAY COMMUNAL FARMS.  THEY RECENTLY </p><p>COLLECTED 10 OLDER CHILDREN FROM THE FARM FOR TRAINING </p><p>AT THE BORDER GEZI NATIONAL YOUTH SERVICE TRAINING </p><p>CENTER NEAR MOUNT DARWIN.  THE KAYS STATED THAT THE </p><p>INTIMIDATION IS DESIGNED BY ZANU-PF TO FORCE THEIR </p><p>WORKERS TO LEAVE SO THAT THEIR FARM GOES OUT OF BUSINESS </p><p>AND THEY CAN NO LONGER SUPPORT THE MDC.  THE GOZ SEES </p><p>THEM AS A THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE RESETTLED BLACK FARMER LAID BARE THE GOZ\'S </p><p>CLAIMS THAT ITS LAND RESETTLEMENT SCHEME IS FOR THE </p><p>BENEFIT OF "THE PEOPLE."  HE STATED THAT HE HAS LIVED </p><p>AND WORKED ON NEARBY LAND MADE AVAILABLE TO HIM BY THE </p><p>GOZ IN 1984.  HE HAD DONE WELL RAISING MAIZE BY APPLYING </p><p>HIMSELF AND HIS SKILLS.  HOWEVER, THIS YEAR, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS BURNED ALL HIS CROPS TO "MAKE AN EXAMPLE" OUT </p><p>OF HIM FOR HIS VILLAGE.  APPARENTLY HIS TRADING TIES </p><p>WITH THE KAYS WERE GROUNDS FOR BEING TARGETED.

(C) SEVERAL INTERLOCUTORS, INCLUDING HIGH COURT </p><p>JUSTICE FERGUS BLACKIE, TOLD THE CRANER DELEGATION THAT </p><p>THE GOZ INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE CASES HAS BEEN HIGHLY SELECTIVE.  MANY TIMES </p><p>THE HIGH COURT HAS POINTED OUT TO THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>JUSTICE, WHICH CONDUCTS PROSECUTIONS, WHO SHOULD BE </p><p>ARRESTED AND PROSECUTED FOR POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED </p><p>CRIMES.  WHENEVER ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS ARE INVOLVED, </p><p>USUALLY NOTHING IS DONE; HOWEVER, IF SOMEONE FROM THE </p><p>MDC CAN BE BLAMED, THOSE CASES ARE MOVED TO THE FRONT OF </p><p>THE COURT DOCKET, BLACKIE AND JUSTICE MOHAMED ALI ADAM </p><p>REMARKED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION IS PART OF THE PLAN </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) A COMMON TOPIC IN A/S CRANER\'S MEETINGS WAS THE </p><p>RECENTLY PASSED PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY ACT (POSA) AND </p><p>GENERAL LAWS AMENDMENTS ACT, WHICH ALTERED THE ELECTORAL </p><p>ACT IN ZANU-PF\'S FAVOR.  THE ZESN REPRESENTATIVES SAID </p><p>THE ELECTORAL ACT, AS AMENDED, REQUIRES ALL VOTER </p><p>EDUCATION TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY </p><p>COMMISSION (ESC).  IT ALSO GIVES THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL, </p><p>WHO IS REGARDED AS A ZANU-PF SYMPATHIZER, MORE CONTROL </p><p>OVER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND COULD CREATE MORE </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTE-RIGGING.  ZESN SAID IT IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00284  03 OF 04  310831Z </p><p>IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT "BAN </p><p>THE MDC" OR "BAN NGOS" AS SOME PRESS REPORTS WOULD HAVE </p><p>IT, BUT THEY DO PLACE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE OPPOSITION AND CIVIL SOCIETY.  TARCY </p><p>ZIMBITI OF THE CCJP SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THE VOTER </p><p>EDUCATION RESTRICTIONS, HIS ORGANIZATION IS NOW </p><p>DESCRIBING ITS EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AS "SOCIAL </p><p>TEACHINGS OF THE CHURCH" AS AN (UNTESTED) WAY AROUND THE </p><p>NEW LAW.  MATCHABA-HOVE OF ZESN REMARKED THAT THE </p><p>CHURCHES ARE NOW THE ONLY PRACTICAL VEHICLE FOR VOTER </p><p>EDUCATION IN ZIMBABWE SINCE 75 PERCENT OF ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>ARE CHURCH-GOING CHRISTIANS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE POSA IS A MATTER OF CONCERN FOR ZESN </p><p>MEMBERS IN THE WAY IT COULD BE USED TO LIMIT CAMPAIGNING </p><p>FOR POLITICAL PARTIES AND FOR GENERAL VOTER EDUCATION. </p><p>PEARSON NHERERE, A PROMINENT ATTORNEY AND TRUSTEE OF THE </p><p>LEGAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION (LRF), STATED THAT THE POSA </p><p>"SEVERELY RESTRICTS PUBLIC GATHERINGS, WHETHER THEY BE </p><p>ON THE STREET OR IN A BUILDING."  ASKED BY PDAS </p><p>CARPENTER WHY ZANU-PF HAD SO FAR FAILED TO PASS THE </p><p>DRACONIAN ACCESS TO INFORMATION BILL AND LABOR RELATIONS </p><p>AMENDMENT BILL, NHERERE STATED THAT THOSE BILLS ARE PART </p><p>OF ZANU-PF\'S LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR STAYING IN POWER AND </p><p>PROVIDE LITTLE ADDED BENEFIT FOR THIS ELECTION.  THEY </p><p>CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT WOULD NOT BRING THEM INTO EFFECT </p><p>UNTIL THREE MONTHS AFTER THEIR PASSAGE; THE ELECTION IS </p><p>ALREADY LESS THAN SIX WEEKS AWAY.  APOLITICAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE NATIONAL AIDS COUNCIL ARE </p><p>CANCELING OUTREACH PROGRAMS OUT OF FEAR OF BEING </p><p>PROSECUTED UNDER THE NEWLY PASSED POSA, ACCORDING TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00284  03 OF 04  310831Z </p><p>MARY NDLOVU OF LRF. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE ELECTION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) IN MEETING WITH ESC CHAIRMAN SOBUSA GULA- </p><p>NDEBELE (A GOZ APPOINTEE), A/S CRANER NOTED THAT THE </p><p>STANDARD FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IS A GLOBAL ONE -- </p><p>NOT JUST AN AMERICAN OR BRITISH ONE -- AND ASKED FOR THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN\'S ASSESSMENT OF WHERE THE ESC STANDS ON </p><p>PREPARING FOR THE MARCH 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p>GULA-NDEBELE IMPLIED THAT THE ESC WAS BEHIND SCHEDULE IN </p><p>ITS PREPARATIONS AND IT WOULD BE A "RUSH" JOB TO FIND </p><p>AND TRAIN ALL THE ELECTION MONITORS IT NEEDS; BUT HE </p><p>ALSO NOTED THAT THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>CONDUCTING THE ELECTION, WHEREAS THE ESC MERELY </p><p>SUPERVISES THEM.

THE CHAIRMAN </p><p>COMMENTED THAT THE DECEMBER CHEGUTU MAYORAL ELECTION IN </p><p>WHICH THE MDC CANDIDATE WON SHOWED THAT THERE IS NO VOTE </p><p>MANIPULATION.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT A </p><p>HIGH NUMBER OF SPOILED BALLOTS COULD SKEW THE RESULTS, </p><p>TO WHICH GULA-NDEBELE REPLIED THAT THE NUMBER IS </p><p>NORMALLY VERY LOW.  RESPONDING TO CONCERNS THAT THE </p><p>NUMBER OF POLLING STATIONS HAS DECREASED IN RECENT </p><p>ELECTIONS (THEREBY MAKING VOTER PARTICIPATION MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT), GULA-NDEBELE CLAIMED THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN </p><p>INCREASE IN POLLING STATIONS IN RURAL AREAS, AND THAT </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE SAYS THERE SHOULD BE MORE THERE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) ZESN\'S NATIONAL COORDINATOR STATED THAT BY </p><p>HOLDING THE HARARE MAYORAL ELECTION AT THE SAME TIME AS </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE GOZ INTENDS TO DRAW MDC </p><p>MONITORS AWAY FROM ZANU-PF STRONGHOLDS IN THE RURAL </p><p>AREAS.  THERE COULD ALSO BE SOME CONFUSION OVER WHICH </p><p>BALLOT GOES IN WHICH BOX, WHICH COULD BENEFIT ZANU-PF. </p><p>THE FARM WORKERS AT CHIPESA FARM SAID THAT DESPITE THE </p><p>INTENSE INTIMIDATION IN RURAL AREAS, PEOPLE ARE NOT </p><p>AFRAID TO VOTE, NOR DO THEY INTEND TO VOTE FOR ZANU-PF. </p><p>MDC VICE-PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA, IN A SEPARATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00284  04 OF 04  310832Z </p><p>MEETING, ECHOED THIS REFRAIN, SAYING PEOPLE ARE </p><p>DETERMINED TO VOTE AND THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE UP </p><p>THEIR MINDS TO VOTE FOR MDC.  EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO </p><p>HOPE OF A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION, IT IS NOT EVEN AN </p><p>OPTION UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE MDC TO BOYCOTT THE </p><p>ELECTION, SIBANDA ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>NO CONSENSUS ON ELECTION OUTCOME OR AFTERMATH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHO IS LIKELY TO WIN THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, MOST OF THE DELEGATION\'S </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS WERE DIVIDED.  MDC ELECTIONS DIRECTOR </p><p>TEMBA-NYATHI STATED THAT HE HAD TO REMAIN OPTIMISTIC </p><p>THAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WOULD PREVAIL DESPITE THE </p><p>TREMENDOUS OBSTACLES.  LOCALLY WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL </p><p>COMMENTATORS, INCLUDING CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE CHAIRMAN </p><p>BRIAN RAFTOPOLOUS, TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN </p><p>JOHN MAKUMBE, TRANSPARENCY DIRECTOR ANDREW NONGOGO, AND </p><p>ZIMBABWE LIBERATORS PLATFORM CHAIRMAN WILFRED MHANDA, </p><p>COULD NOT AGREE ON WHO THE ULTIMATE WINNER WOULD BE. </p><p>MHANDA WAS ADAMANT THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD DO </p><p>ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING TO WIN THE ELECTION REGARDLESS OF </p><p>THE CONSEQUENCES, WHEREAS NONGOGO ARGUED THAT MUGABE </p><p>STILL VALUES THE LEGITIMACY THAT AN ELECTION CONVEYS AND </p><p>WOULD NOT BLATANTLY RIG THE VOTE, EVEN IF IT MEANT </p><p>RISKING A LOSS. </p><p> </p><p>15.

A/S CRANER RELAYED TO THE MDC LEADERSHIP </p><p>THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS COUNTING ON THE MDC </p><p>TO CHANNEL ZIMBABWEANS\' ANGER IF THE ELECTION WERE </p><p>STOLEN.  SEKAI HOLLAND, THE MDC\'S INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELATIONS SECRETARY, COMMENTED THAT IT IS GETTING MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO CONTROL YOUTHS AND OTHERS WHO ARE </p><p>INCREASINGLY DETERMINED TO RETALIATE IN THE FACE OF </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S INTIMIDATION.  SIBANDA SAID THE MDC LEADERSHIP </p><p>WOULD DO ITS BEST TO RESTRAIN THE PARTY\'S SUPPORTERS, </p><p>BUT HE FULLY EXPECTS THE MDC YOUTH TO DEFY THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP\'S CALLS FOR RESTRAINT IF THE MDC LOSES. </p><p>TARCY ZIMBITI OF THE CCJP SAID IF TSVANGIRAI WINS, THE </p><p>COUNTRY COULD PLUMMET INTO A LOW-INTENSITY CIVIL WAR </p><p>WHERE RESETTLED FARMERS REFUSE TO GIVE UP LAND GIVEN TO </p><p>THEM BY ZANU-PF; ALTERNATIVELY, IF MUGABE WINS, HE </p><p>EXPECTS THE HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS TO ERUPT IN VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>16.
