<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 000754 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p></p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: CROATIAN CABINET ORDERS HUMANITARIAN </p><p>CONTRIBUTION FOR IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ON APRIL 3, THE CROATIAN CABINET PASSED A DECISION </p><p>(SEE TEXT AT PARA 4) TO SEND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE WITH A </p><p>VALUE OF JUST UNDER USD 3 MILLION TO IRAQ.  THE ASSISTANCE </p><p>SHOULD INCLUDE BLANKETS, SLEEPING BAGS, BED LINENS, FLOUR, </p><p>SUGAR, AND WATER PURIFICATION AGENTS.  THE CABINET ALSO </p><p>DIRECTED THE GOC TO CONSIDER SENDING "EXPERT ASSISTANCE" TO </p><p>SUPPORT HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ON APRIL 4 WE MET WITH ANDREA BEKIC OF THE MFA\'S </p><p>NORTH AMERICAN DESK TO SEEK FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE </p><p>CROATIAN CONTRIBUTION.  BEKIC INSISTED THAT CROATIA WANTS TO </p><p>BE SEEN -- PARTICULARLY BY THE U.S. -- AS DOING ITS PART FOR </p><p>POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION.  THE MFA HAD BEEN TASKED BY THE </p><p>SENIOR-LEVEL "CRISIS COMMITTEE" TO FIND WAYS TO TRANSPORT THE </p><p>CARGO.  GIVEN PAST DIFFICULTIES, WE MADE SURE SHE UNDERSTOOD </p><p>THAT ORGANIZING AIRLIFT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT; THE GOC </p><p>SHOULD NOT/NOT COUNT ON A POSITIVE RESPONSE IF IT APPROACHES </p><p>THE USG WITH A REQUEST FOR AIRLIFT. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) BEKIC SAID THAT CROATIA\'S MISSION TO NATO WAS </p><p>MAKING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COLLEAGUES IN BRUSSELS FOR DELIVERY </p><p>OF PART OF THE DONATION TO TURKEY.  THE REST OF THE DONATION </p><p>IS DESIGNATED FOR USE IN IRAQ.  WE SUGGESTED THAT OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES INTERESTED IN MAKING AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SITUATION ARE MAKING MONETARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO </p><p>    NGO\'S ALREADY ACTIVE IN THE REGION.  CROATIA\'S EMBASSY IN </p><p>WASHINGTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED AT THE WEEKLY </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) BEGIN TEXT OF THE GOC APRIL 5 DECISION (NOTE INTERNAL </p><p>NUMBERING): </p><p> </p><p>(I)  ABOUT 20 MILLION KUNA (USD 2.85 MILLION) WORTH OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE SHALL BE SENT TO THE WAR-AFFECTED </p><p>POPULATION IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>(II)  THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE SHALL BE SENT AS NEEDED AND </p><p>POSSIBLE TO DISTRIBUTE. </p><p> </p><p>(III)  THE ASSISTANCE SHALL CONSIST OF BLANKETS, TENTS, </p><p>SLEEPING BAGS, FLOUR, SUGAR, FIELD BEDS, BED LINEN, AND </p><p>WATER-PURIFICATION AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>(IV)  THE CRISIS COMMITTEE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA SHALL </p><p>BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>(V)  THE CRISIS COMMITTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA IS </p><p>INSTRUCTED TO CONSIDER SENDING EXPERT ASSISTANCE AIMED AT </p><p>ALLEVIATING THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
