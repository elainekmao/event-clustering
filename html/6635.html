<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 000657 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR, Political Parties/Elections </p><p>SUBJECT:  MOST CROATIAN POLITICAL PARTIES DISAPPROVE OF THE MILITARY ACTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  MEDIA COVERAGE OF IRAQ IN CROATIA IN THE LAST 24 HOURS </p><p>HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY HOSTILE TO THE U.S. POSITION.  MUCH OF </p><p>IT HAS FOCUSED ON CRITICISM OF THE IRAQ CAMPAIGN BY MEMBERS </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT.  MPS REPRESENTING THE RULING COALITION AND </p><p>JOINED BY SOME OF THE MARGINAL PARTIES IN THE OPPOSITION </p><p>    HAVE ECHOED THE VIEWS AIRED BY THE GOVERNMENT -- THEY </p><p>REGRET THE ATTACK ON IRAQ AND PURPORT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER.  ONLY THE CHIEF </p><p>OPPOSITION HDZ PARTY DECLINED TO OFFER COMMENTS, POINTING </p><p>OUT ITS VIEWS HAD BEEN PRESENTED EARLIER.  ON THE EVE OF </p><p>THE WAR, THE HDZ WAS THE ONLY CROATIAN POLITICAL PARTY TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE U.S. POLICY ON IRAQ, INCLUDING IN A BROADLY </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OP-ED PIECE IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LAST WEEK </p><p>BY PARTY LEADER IVO SANADER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  PEOPLES PARTY PRESIDENT VESNA PUSIC (HNS) TOOK THE </p><p>GLASS AS HALF FULL PERSPECTIVE OF THE CONFLICT.  SHE WISHED </p><p>THE WAR, FOR THE SAKE OF BOTH ALLIED FORCES AND THE IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE, WOULD BE OVER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, WITH SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN GONE.  SHE LOOKED FORWARD TO REBUILDING DEMOCRATIC </p><p>INSTITUTIONS.  OTHERS WERE LESS OPTIMISTIC.  ZDRAVKO TOMAC </p><p>(SDP), WHO CHAIRS THE PARLIAMENTARY FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE, SAID THAT THE U.N. SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN MORE </p><p>TIME AS "IRAQ AT THE MOMENT POSED NO THREAT TO WORLD </p><p>PEACE."  THE PRESIDENT OF THE LIBRA PARTY, JOZO RADOS, </p><p>CONDEMNED THE DECISION TO ATTACK IRAQ WITHOUT A SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL RESOLUTION.  HE TOLD REPORTERS THE DECISION </p><p>"PROBABLY MEANT SOWING THE SEEDS OF TERRORISM FOR THE </p><p>FUTURE."  THE LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENT, IVO BANAC, SAID </p><p>THAT, WITHOUT UNSC APPROVAL, THE WAR WAS A "DANGEROUS </p><p>OPERATION WITH UNCLEAR RESULTS."  HE ADDED THAT THE "U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD BEAR ALL CONSEQUENCES" FOR THE DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  EXCEPT FOR HDZ, CROATIAN OPPOSITION PARTIES AIRED </p><p>SIMILAR NEGATIVE VIEWS.  THE SOCIAL LIBERAL PRESIDENT </p><p>DRAZEN BUDISA (HSLS) SAID THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR WOULD </p><p>    BE GRAVE FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS, FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW, </p><p>FOR THE ROLE OF THE UN AND FOR RELATIONS AMONG ALLIES IN </p><p>THE EURO-ATLANTIC PROCESS.  DEMOCRATIC CENTER PRESIDENT </p><p>MATE GRANIC (DC) SUPPORTED THE PRINCIPLE OF MILITARY </p><p>INTERVENTIONS WITHIN THE UNSC FRAMEWORK, RATHER THAN </p><p>"PLAYING ON THE CARD OF DIVISIONS" BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE </p><p>EU, OR EVEN WITHIN THE EU.  CROATIAN BLOC LEADER IVIC </p><p>PASALIC (HB) HOPED THE ACTION WOULD BE OVER AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE AND CASUALTIES KEPT TO A MINIMUM.  ANTO DJAPIC OF </p><p>THE RIGHT WING CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHTS (HSP) DESCRIBED THE </p><p>MILITARY ACTION AS POSING THE "BIGGEST CRISIS FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORDER IN THE LAST 40 YEARS." </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
