Hanoi 072      B.  02 STATE 235694 </p><p> </p><p>-     C.  02 Hanoi 2862  D.  02 Hanoi 2969 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  In two recent meetings with the </p><p>Ambassador, GVN officials discussed religious freedom issues </p><p>originally raised by Ambassador Hanford at the November 2002 </p><p>Human Rights Dialogue in a frank manner, but had little </p><p>specific information.  The most welcome news was that the </p><p>Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam should be able to </p><p>open its long-anticipated theological school to 50 students </p><p>in January.  Reductions in restrictions on Thich Huyen Quang </p><p>and Thich Quang Do remain possible and Father Nguyen Van </p><p>Ly\'s sentence might be reduced as well, based on "good </p><p>attitude."  Officials promised to continue to investigate </p><p>various problems cited by Ambassador Hanford and Ambassador </p><p>Burghardt, including an apparently official document </p><p>describing efforts on renunciations of faith.  Officials </p><p>also indicated the possibility that independent foreign </p><p>observers might be allowed to investigate problems.  While </p><p>these good discussions were welcome and offer the </p><p>possibility of Vietnam moving more in the right direction on </p><p>these issues, concrete GVN actions since Ambassador </p><p>Hanford\'s November demarche have been few.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Expressing USG Concerns </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Ambassador met separately with Government Committee </p><p>on Religious Affairs (CRA) Chairman Le Quang Vinh and Deputy </p><p>Foreign Minister Le Van Bang on January 14 to discuss </p><p>religious freedom issues initially raised by Ambassador </p><p>Hanford during the November 8, 2002 US-Vietnam Human Rights </p><p>Dialogue (ref b).  He noted that he had also discussed these </p><p>issues in late November with Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien </p><p>(ref c). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Ambassador noted that concerns about new reported </p><p>religious freedom problems circulated in the international </p><p>press had drawn considerable attention, including from </p><p>members of Congress.  Moreover, the International Religious </p><p>Freedom Act (IRFA) requires Ambassador Hanford to make </p><p>recommendations on Country of Particular Concern designation </p><p>based on the best available information.  Even if </p><p>information was difficult to obtain and verify, the IRFA </p><p>still required an annual recommendation.  Ambassador </p><p>emphasized that the main purpose of meeting with both </p><p>Chairman Vinh and DFM Bang was to clarify specific </p><p>allegations, to determine if the GVN was investigating them, </p><p>and learn what was being done if the allegations were true. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Observing that the GVN was often defensive about </p><p>religious freedom issues, Ambassador suggested the GVN </p><p>undertake a more pro-active stance, such as inviting </p><p>journalists, human rights NGO\'s, and diplomats freely to </p><p>investigate reported problems, rather than the GVN issuing </p><p>blanket denials.  The most noteworthy problems recently </p><p>included reports of house church closings, forced </p><p>renunciations of faith, disappearances of about 40 </p><p>Protestant leaders in the Central Highlands as well as </p><p>others in the Northwest Highlands.   Ambassador also asked </p><p>for any information relevant to allegations that police had </p><p>beaten Hmong Christian leader Mua Bua Senh a number of </p><p>times, leading to Senh\'s eventual death in August 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Following up on the Embassy\'s provision to the CRA </p><p>in December 2002 of a copy of what was purported to be a </p><p>Khanh Hoa provincial police document that described efforts </p><p>to convince citizens to renounce their faith (ref a), </p><p>Ambassador asked if the CRA had yet investigated the </p><p>document and, if genuine, if anything had been done to the </p><p>involved authorities.  If the document was false, Ambassador </p><p>urged the GVN to make this clear as well as to reaffirm that </p><p>forced renunciations of faith were counter to GVN policy on </p><p>religious freedom. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Ambassador also asked if reports that hundreds of </p><p>house church closings in the Central Highlands and Northwest </p><p>Highlands were true.  He expressed concern that formal </p><p>registration remained so difficult that many house churches </p><p>do not try to register, and urged instead that local </p><p>authorities provide assistance and encourage registration. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)   Noting that the last congress of the Evangelical </p><p>Church of Vietnam-North (ECVN) was in 1988, Ambassador noted </p><p>that this delay had fueled suspicions that the GVN was </p><p>afraid that the ECVN would select leaders that the GVN did </p><p>not like.  He urged that the GVN work with the ECVN to </p><p>encourage it to hold its congress, rather than continue to </p><p>claim that this delay was due to ECVN internal reasons only. </p><p>8.  (U)  Ambassador noted that one of the most frequent </p><p>complaints from both Catholics and Protestants was that they </p><p>do not have enough clergy.  He regretted the delays in </p><p>opening a new Catholic seminary (or seminary branch) in Dong </p><p>Nai province as well as the theological school of the </p><p>Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) in Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City; he urged the GVN to provide adequate permission and </p><p>assistance in the establishment of these overdue and much- </p><p>needed facilities. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Ambassador rejected GVN claims that Vietnam had no </p><p>religious prisoners, noting that there are clearly prisoners </p><p>whom people overseas see as religious leaders.  He expressed </p><p>concern that it was almost impossible for foreigners to get </p><p>information about these prisoners or to meet with them.  He </p><p>offered his personal view that the single best and easiest </p><p>thing Vietnam could do to gain international respect would </p><p>be to drop restrictions on highly respected Buddhist leaders </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do so that they might live </p><p>where they wish, see whom they wish, and do what they want. </p><p>Regarding prisoner Father Nguyen Van Ly, Ambassador </p><p>emphasized that GVN stories about Father Ly\'s personal life </p><p>were beside the point; regardless, 15 years imprisonment was </p><p>too long a sentence for doing nothing more than saying </p><p>something that the GVN did not like.  Ambassador asked for </p><p>assistance in delivering the many Christmas cards he has </p><p>received for Father Ly. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>GVN Responses </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  SECV Theological school:  CRA Chairman Vinh </p><p>assured Ambassador that the SECV would be able to open its </p><p>theological school in January.  He said that he had </p><p>personally informed the SECV of this after Christmas, </p><p>following the Prime Minister\'s approval.  The school was </p><p>currently recruiting students and facility as well as </p><p>establishing its curriculum, and would be able to admit 50 </p><p>students.  For the time being, however, its student body </p><p>would be limited due to its temporary location at the SECV </p><p>headquarters.  He claimed that delay in opening had stemmed </p><p>from Ho Chi Minh City authorities.  Separately, DFM Bang </p><p>appeared to be aware of the decision regarding the SECV </p><p>theological school, but offered no further comment. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  New Catholic Seminary:  CRA Chairman Vinh </p><p>explained that the new Catholic seminary in Dong Nai had </p><p>similarly been held up by the adamant refusal of provincial </p><p>authorities; the CRA was now encouraging the search for a </p><p>different site.  (Note:  Dong Nai authorities have </p><p>attributed their reluctance to approve the seminary to the </p><p>lack of provincial educational authorities able to supervise </p><p>a tertiary-level institution.  End note) </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Persons of concern:  Chairman Vinh promised that </p><p>the CRA would work with the Ministry of Public Security and </p><p>"higher authorities" to facilitate actions regarding persons </p><p>of concern such as Thich Huyen Quang, Thich Quang Do, and </p><p>Father Nguyen Van Ly.  He claimed that it should be possible </p><p>to forward mail to prisoners, including Father Ly. </p><p>Separately, DFM Bang said that he had heard that Father Ly\'s </p><p>attitude in prison had improved, a precondition to reduction </p><p>in sentence.  MFA officials also indicated that they would </p><p>ask MPS to identify the prison location of Father Ly, and </p><p>share that information with Embassy.  DFM Bang added that </p><p>MFA was continuing to research the list of persons of </p><p>concern the Ambassador Hanford provided in August 2002, and </p><p>agreed to determine whether any of them had been amnestied </p><p>in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Independent investigations:  Chairman Vinh </p><p>responded positively to the suggestion of inviting </p><p>journalists, NGO\'s, and diplomats to investigate reported </p><p>problems.  While he clarified that he could not make </p><p>decisions about such matters, he promised to recommend the </p><p>idea to his superiors. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Renunciations:  Chairman Vinh confirmed that the </p><p>GVN strictly prohibited discriminatory treatment on </p><p>religious grounds.  He emphasized that a citizen is free to </p><p>persuade a fellow citizen to adopt or drop a religious </p><p>belief, but that the State definitely would not do so.  He </p><p>pledged that the GVN would openly address any violations of </p><p>that policy and would criticize -- or discipline -- any </p><p>officials guilty of such violations.  In answer to </p><p>Ambassador\'s question, Vinh claimed that the GVN had </p><p>actually done so in some cases already, while admitting that </p><p>central authorities could not easily inspect and control </p><p>activities in many remote places.  Ambassador urged the GVN </p><p>to publicize when it punished officials for interfering with </p><p>citizens\' freedom of belief. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  Khanh Hoa:  Chairman Vinh promised to report the </p><p>information on forced renunciations, including the Khanh Hoa </p><p>document, to higher authorities.  However, he did not </p><p>respond specifically to the validity of the Khanh Hoa </p><p>document.  DFM Bang did not address the Khanh Hoa document </p><p>either, but the MFA Americas Department staff requested a </p><p>copy, which Embassy provided on January 15. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  Highlands:  Both Chairman Vinh and MFA officials </p><p>described the situation in the Central Highlands and the </p><p>Northwest Highlands as "special."  Chairman Vinh provided a </p><p>lengthy account of separate efforts to establish a "Dega" </p><p>state in the Central Highlands and a Hmong kingdom </p><p>encompassing parts on Vietnam, Laos, China, Thailand, and </p><p>Burma.  Tracing these efforts to FULRO on the one hand and </p><p>Vang Pao on the other, Vinh claimed that the violent history </p><p>of these efforts and their current use of "Dega" </p><p>Protestantism and "Vang Chu" (a Hmong term for </p><p>Protestantism) "worries" provincial authorities.   MFA </p><p>officials echoed these points in less detail.  Ambassador </p><p>noted that, although only a few people seemed to be involved </p><p>in these movements, local authorities appeared to treat all </p><p>Protestants in these areas the same regardless of whether </p><p>they had anything to do with the separatist groups.  This </p><p>probably had the negative effect of driving more people into </p><p>these movements.  Chairman Vinh replied that central </p><p>authorities had spoken "many times" with local officials </p><p>about the need to respect religion.  While the State was </p><p>working hard to ensure respect for "those who practice </p><p>religion with pure intent," it could not ignore those who </p><p>"use religion as a cover for political conspiracies." </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U)  Mua Bua Senh:  Chairman Vinh claimed that he was </p><p>not aware of the case of Mua Bua Senh, but promised that he </p><p>would contact local authorities.  He expressed disbelief </p><p>that Senh had been beaten just because of his religion. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U)  ECVN:  Chairman Vinh explained that, although the </p><p>ECVN is small, it had two factions that sued each other </p><p>after the last ECVN congress over a financial issue.  Until </p><p>that dispute was resolved, Vinh claimed, it would not be </p><p>possible to hold another congress.  He rejected Ambassador\'s </p><p>suggestion that the ECVN settle the dispute at a congress, </p><p>because the settlement and congress must happen "according </p><p>to law."  He added that the situation was further muddied by </p><p>"unqualified" persons who claim to be "authorized voices" as </p><p>well as evangelists within the ECVN.  He noted that CRA </p><p>officials recently traveled to help provincial authorities </p><p>sort out who was and who was not an ECVN official.  Vinh </p><p>emphasized that the CRA indeed wanted the ECVN to hold a </p><p>congress and was trying to be supportive. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU)  Hanford demarche:  DFM Bang said that the MFA </p><p>was investigating the four points Ambassador Hanford </p><p>highlighted during the November 2002 Human Rights Dialogue. </p><p>He invited Ambassador Hanford to visit Vietnam again.  He </p><p>noted that it was also important to keep in sight how the </p><p>overall religious situation in Vietnam had improved over the </p><p>last ten years.  He revealed that the CPV Central Committee </p><p>had discussed how to work out religious issues over the long- </p><p>term during the second session of its seventh plenum, which </p><p>began on January 13.  This was unprecedented, he claimed, </p><p>and showed how seriously CPV and GVN authorities were about </p><p>further improving the situation of religious freedom.   He </p><p>noted that CPV General Secretary Nong Duc Manh had </p><p>acknowledged that one-fourth of the Vietnamese population </p><p>followed religion, and that religion had strong beneficial </p><p>effect on the youth.  He pointed out Vietnam\'s relations </p><p>with the Vatican were much better than China\'s, and that </p><p>Vietnam had a great deal more religious freedom than </p><p>countries like Saudi Arabia. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU)  Comment:  These two meetings were the broadest </p><p>and most candid on the subject of religion that Ambassador </p><p>has conducted with GVN officials since his arrival over one </p><p>year ago.  The increasing willingness of the GVN to engage </p><p>in a discussion as detailed as this would have been </p><p>unthinkable not too many years ago.  They had some solid </p><p>good news on the SECV theological school and indicated new </p><p>signs of flexibility about investigating other areas of </p><p>concern.  This offers the possibility of Vietnam moving in </p><p>the right direction on these issues.  That said, Ambassador </p><p>Hanford\'s own demarche to the GVN delegation in November </p><p>should have set the ball in motion about addressing our main </p><p>concerns, but there does not appear to have been much </p><p>significant movement in the intervening months in response. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
