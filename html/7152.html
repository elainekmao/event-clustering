<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000671 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, CASC, YM, EAC </p><p>SUBJECT: TF1Z01:  SANAA EAC MEETING APRIL 6 </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 661 (NODIS) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer, for reasons 1.5 ( </p><p>b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  The Charge convened an Emergency Action Committee </p><p>(EAC) meeting on April 6 to assess threat information and </p><p>discuss Sheraton security in light of concerns expressed by </p><p>President Saleh April 5 (reftel).  Key offices and personnel </p><p>represented at the meeting included: ADMIN, Charge, CONS, </p><p>DAO, FPD, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RMO and SOC YEMEN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported no new specific threat information. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  EAC discussed Sheraton Hotel security (currently </p><p>home to 24 Embassy TDY personnel, nearly all of whom are </p><p>military).  President Saleh April 5 asked Charge if Embassy </p><p>would consider removing its personnel from the Sheraton Hotel </p><p>to the Embassy for the duration of the war in Iraq.  He cited </p><p>no specific threat information, which was corroborated by PSO </p><p>Chief Gamish.  Saleh brought subject up in a matter of fact </p><p>manner, and Gamish asked Charge to "think about it." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  On April 6, RSO raised Sheraton security with MOI </p><p>second-in-command BG Ahmed Sunidar.  RSO asked if ROYG was </p><p>aware of any threat to the hotel, and whether MOI saw cause </p><p>to consider relocating to another location during the Iraq </p><p>war.  Sunidar expressed surprise at the idea that the </p><p>Americans saw a need to depart the Sheraton Hotel.  Sunidar </p><p>had no threat related information regarding the Sheraton </p><p>Hotel and, because of the line of questions, asked if the </p><p>Embassy had any knowledge of a threat.  Sunidar went on to </p><p>list reasons that the Sheraton Hotel was the best most secure </p><p>choice, which included recent physical security upgrades, </p><p>best utilization of MOI security assets, and close proximity </p><p>to the American Embassy which reduced the time and distance </p><p>Embassy employees were exposed as soft targets while driving </p><p>to and from work.  (Note:  Sunidar was the ranking ROYG </p><p>official at a recent working lunch, also attended by DCM and </p><p>RSO, in which on-site security arrangements were discussed in </p><p>great detail with the Sheraton management.  The ROYG has been </p><p>cooperative and forward-leaning in upgrading hotel security </p><p>over past months.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Saleh\'s Possible Reasons </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  EAC discussed possible reasons for Saleh\'s </p><p>suggestion, including: </p><p> </p><p>--  uneasiness on Saleh\'s part that security is not solely </p><p>provided by the ROYG at the Sheraton; </p><p> </p><p>--  non-specific threat information that he is unwilling to </p><p>divulge; </p><p> </p><p>--  commercial reasons possibly relating to the Sheraton; </p><p> </p><p>--  an unclear understanding on the part of Saleh of the </p><p>comprehensive security measures in place at the Sheraton (in </p><p>contrast to the perfunctory measures in place at Tourist </p><p>City); </p><p> </p><p>-- desire on Saleh\'s part to appear to be "doing something" </p><p>to ensure Amcit security. </p><p> </p><p>EAC members lacked sufficient information to draw any </p><p>conclusions about Saleh\'s reasoning.  They agreed that a) it </p><p>could not be ignored but b) was hard to understand and </p><p>impossible to justify on strict security grounds -- </p><p>particularly in the absence of specific threat information. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Comparative Security </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  EAC members discussed the security provisions at the </p><p>Sheraton Hotel, security at other possible locations and the </p><p>ramifications of a change, noting the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- following numerous security upgrades in recent months, the </p><p>Sheraton is the second-hardest target in Yemen after the </p><p>Embassy; </p><p> </p><p>--  when specific threat information was known in late 2002 </p><p>about possible vehicle-borne attacks against hotels in Sanaa </p><p>and Aden, the EAC assessed all available options and decided </p><p>that the Sheraton remained preferable to any alternative </p><p>housing site(s); </p><p> </p><p>--  comprehensive security measures at the Sheraton include </p><p>1)  equipment such as drop barriers able to stop vehicles </p><p>going up to 40MPH and metal detectors, 2)  personnel </p><p>well-trained in using all equipment and 3)  procedures that </p><p>are in place and working well; </p><p> </p><p>--  other possible locations such as Tourist City near the </p><p>Embassy are much less secure, with the possibility of </p><p>vehicle-borne threat at a much higher level; </p><p> </p><p>--  wide dispersal of personnel to other locations throughout </p><p>Sanaa would stress the capability of the ROYG to protect them; </p><p> </p><p>--  removing personnel from the Sheraton could degrade their </p><p>security posture and make it difficult to raise the level of </p><p>Sheraton security again after the Iraq war ends. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Suggested Embassy Response </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  EAC members decided to respond to Saleh\'s </p><p>concerns by doing the following: </p><p> </p><p>--  using existing ROYG channels via ORCA and RSO to pursue a </p><p>dialogue on the issue; </p><p> </p><p>--  offering to brief appropriate ROYG officials, perhaps </p><p>including the President, on details of Sheraton security with </p><p>a comparison of the poorer security offered by other options; </p><p> </p><p>--  telling ROYG that the Embassy is considering the issue </p><p>seriously, reassessing Sheraton security, actively seeking </p><p>options that would provide comparable or superior security to </p><p>that provided at the Sheraton, and minimizing official Amcit </p><p>presence at the Sheraton and in Yemen as a whole; </p><p> </p><p>-- re-doubling Embassy\'s focus on Sheraton security to ensure </p><p>that equipment, security personnel and equipment continue in </p><p>top working order; </p><p> </p><p>--  putting the onus back on the ROYG to tell Embassy of any </p><p>places that might be more secure than the Sheraton and of any </p><p>possible threats immediately. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
