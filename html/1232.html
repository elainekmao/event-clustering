(SBU) SUMMARY.  OUTLYING DISTRICTS OF HANOI ARE </p><p>ATTRACTING LARGE NUMBERS OF "IMMIGRANTS" FROM DEPRESSED </p><p>RURAL AREAS SEEKING EMPLOYMENT.  MANUFACTURING JOBS </p><p>HERE, THOUGH MISERABLY PAID BY U.S. STANDARDS, </p><p>NEVERTHELESS PAY FAR MORE THAN THE PEASANT FARMS THEY </p><p>LEAVE BEHIND.  TO GET A FIRST HAND LOOK AT THIS </p><p>PHENOMENON, POLOFF SPENT MOST OF A DAY MEETING </p><p>RESIDENTS OF TWO SUCH DISTRICTS, DONG ANH AND SOC SON. </p><p>THEY SPOKE OF PROBLEMS WITH YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT, THE </p><p>DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING GOVERNMENT JOBS, INSUFFICIENT </p><p>BENEFITS, AND LONG WORK HOURS.  POLOFF ALSO VISITED A </p><p>SHOP DOING BRISK SALES OF CHEAP "COUNTERFEIT" CHINESE </p><p>MOTORBIKES TO THESE LOW-INCOME OUTSIDERS.  DESPITE </p><p>THEIR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, MANY RESIDENTS SAID THEY LIVE </p><p>BETTER TODAY THAN FORMERLY BECAUSE OF VIETNAM\'S MORE </p><p>OPEN ECONOMY.  POLOFF WAS IMPRESSED TO LEARN THAT </p><p>SEEMINGLY PENNILESS RESIDENTS HAVE NEVERTHELESS MANAGED </p><p>TO SAVE ENOUGH FROM MEAGER INCOMES TO SEND CHILDREN TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p>COLLEGE.  INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF </p><p>HANOI WILL CONTINUE TO ATUT THE SOCIO- </p><p>ECONOMIC CONSIDITIONS IN WHICH THEY LIVE.  WHILE NOT </p><p>INTENDING TO BE SCIENTIFIC OR EXHAUSTIVE, WE HOPE TO </p><p>GIVE READERS A CLEARER IMPRESSION OF HOW RESIDENTS OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S CAPITAL AND SECOND LARGEST CITY FEEL ABOUT </p><p>THEIR LIVES IN A COUNTRY UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGE.  THIS </p><p>CABLE REPORTS CONVERSATIONS OF POLOFF AND FSN POLITICAL </p><p>ASSISTANT WITH RESIDENTS OF TWO ADJACENT SEMI-RURAL, </p><p>SEMI-INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS, DONG ANH AND SOC SON, </p><p>LOCATED AT THE EDGE OF HANOI ALONG ROUTE 3 LINKING </p><p>HANOI TO THE PROVINCE OF THAI NGUYEN. </p><p> </p><p>A NOTE ON DONG ANH </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE DISTRICT OF DONG ANH, POPULATION 258,400, </p><p>IS LOCATED 23 KILOMETERS NORTH OF THE CITY OF HANOI. </p><p>IT IS DIVIDED INTO 23 COMMUNES, WITH AN OVERALL </p><p>POPULATION DENSITY OF 1,346 PERSONS PER SQUARE </p><p>KILOMETER.  WITH SEVERAL LARGE ENTERPRISES AND FOREIGN </p><p>JOINT VENTURES, IT OFFERS JOBS IN THE MANUFACTURING </p><p>SECTOR WHICH HAVE ATTRACTED MANY OUTSIDERS.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO GVN STATISTICS, ANNUAL PER CAPITA INCOME IS VND </p><p>2,760,000 (USD 197.) </p><p> </p><p>GVN RETIREE: "TODAY, PRIVATE SECTRS. HANG, AT THE TEA STAND THEY </p><p>OWN.  MR. HANG, 52, IS A RETIRED GOVERNMENT MECHANIC. </p><p>MRS. HANG DOES MOST OF THE WORK RUNNING THE STAND. THEY </p><p>COMMENTED ON ECONOMIC CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING </p><p>IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE HANGS SAID THE BEST-OFF EMPLOYEES IN </p><p>THEIR AREA ARE THOSE WHO WORK AT THE LOCAL HANEL PLANT. </p><p>ORION-HANEL IS A SOUTH KOREA-VIETNAM JOINT VENTURE </p><p>WHICH MANUFACTURES TELEVISION PICTURE TUBES.  WORKERS </p><p>AT THE HANEL FACTORY EARN VND 1 MILLION PER MONTH (USD </p><p>71), ENOUGH TO BUILD INDIVIDUAL HOMES FOR THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES.  THESE WORKERS ENJOY REAL JOB SECURITY, THE </p><p>HANGS SAID, AND WITH LOCAL CONSUMERQRICES LOW, THEY </p><p>LIVE RATHER WELL. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) THE SITUATION IS MORE PROBLEMATIC FOR THOSE </p><p>EMPLOYED IN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR.  MR. HANG RECEIVES A </p><p>PENSION OF VND 400,000 PER MONTH (USD 28) FOR HIS YEARS </p><p>OF SERVICE, "ENOUGH TO LIVE WELL AND LET MY KIDS TAKE </p><p>CARE OF ME," HE SAID.  TODAY, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SO,BASIS RATHER THAN AS PERMANENT EMPLOYEES.  CONTRACT SALARIES, HE </p><p>SAID, ARE NO BETTER THAN THOSE EARNED BY PERMANENT </p><p>EMPLOYEES, BUT CONTRACTORS DON\'T RECEIVE COMPARABLE </p><p>BENEFITS.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE SAID, A CONTRACTOR WOULD NOT </p><p>RECEIVE HIS SECURE PENSION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) MRS. HANG ADDED THAT IT IS BECOMING EXTREMELY </p><p>DIFFICULT TO GET A GOVERNMENT JOB.  INCREASINGLY, SHE </p><p>SAID, YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE AREA "LAZE AROUND THE HOUSE" </p><p>BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO JOBS.  IN MANY CASES, SHE SAID, </p><p>THEY LACK BOTH THE CREDENTIALS TO OBTAIN JOBS AND THE </p><p>WHEREWITHAL TO OFFER THE BRIBES NECESSARY TO OBTAIN </p><p>THEM.  SHE EXPLAINED THAT OBTAINING A GOVERNMENT JOB </p><p>USUALLY MEANT PROVIDING THE RELEVANT OFFICIAL A SUM OF </p><p>MONEY OR A SUBSTANTIAL GIFT. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) MRS. HANG SAID SHE ENJOYS GOOD RELATIONS WITH </p><p>LOCAL OFFICIALS.  SHE BOASTED THAT BECAUSE HER TEA </p><p>STAND EARNS ONLY A MODEST INCOME, THEY ALLOW HER TO RUN </p><p>THE STAND WITHOUT PAYING TAXES, WHILE OTHERS MUST PAY. </p><p> </p><p>SUCCESSFUL YOUTH WORK SEVENTY HOURS A WEEK IN WORKSHOPS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) IN THE NEIGHBORING DONG ANH VILLAGE OF DUC </p><p>TU, POLOFF CHATTED WITH A GROUP OF MEN AT A MAKESHIFT </p><p>OUTDOOR TEA GARDEN.  MOST WERE IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES, </p><p>ALTHOUGH TWO WERE IN THEIR FORTIES.  THE LEADER OF THE </p><p>GROUP SEEMED TO BE MR. LAP, AGE 23. </p><p> </p><p>10.   (SBU) THE YOUNG MEN WORK AT A NEARBY STEEL </p><p>FABRICATING WORKSHOP.  THESE WORKSHOPS HAVE BECOME A </p><p>SPECIALTY OF THE VILLAGE, AND ONE SEES THEM ALMOST </p><p>EVERYWHERE.  MR. LAP SAID THAT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES, </p><p>ALL OF WHOM HAVE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATIONS, ARE HAPPY TO </p><p>HAVE WELL-PAYING JOBS THERE (THEY EARN ABOUT VND 2 </p><p>MILLION A MONTH, ABOUT USD 142), BUT WORK VERY LONG </p><p>HOURS FOR THEIR SALARIES: TEN HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A </p><p>WEEK.  STILL, THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES PARTICULARLY </p><p>SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE MOST OF THEIR PARENTS ARE RURAL </p><p>PEASANTS WHO EARN LESS IN ONE YEAR THAN THEY EARN IN A </p><p>MONTH.  MR. LAP, LIKE MOST OF HIS COHORTS, IS SINGLE </p><p>SINCE HE HAS NOT YET REACHED THE AGE OF 25, CONSIDERED </p><p>THE IDEAL MARRIAGE AGE FOR A MAN IN SEMI-RURAL DUC TU. </p><p>(NOTE: THE IDEAL MARRIAGE AGE FOR A WOMAN IN THIS AREA </p><p>IS CONSIDERED TO BE ABOUT 18.  END NOTE.) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) ABOUT HALF THE LOCAL WORKERS ARE FROM DUC TU </p><p>ITSELF, BUT THE OTHER HALF HAIL FROM STILL POORER </p><p>NEARBY VILLAGES, OR FROM THE NEIGHBORING PROVINCE OF </p><p>THAI NGUYEN, SAID THE WORKERS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME </p><p>TRAINED TECHNICIANS FROM SAIGON AT THE VARIOUS </p><p>WORKSHOPS, THEY ADDED.  THESE OUTSIDERS ARE WELCOMED </p><p>BECAUSE THE WORKSHOPS NEED LABOR.  SEVERAL OUTSIDERS </p><p>HAVE MARRIED WOMEN FROM THE VILLAGE.  STILL, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THEY ARE WELCOMED, THEY ARE STILL CONSIDERED OUTSIDERS </p><p>WHO WERE NOT BORN IN DUC TU. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) THESE YOUNG MEN SEEMED HAPPY ABOUT THEIR </p><p>CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FAR BETTER THAN THOSE OF </p><p>THEIR PARENTS.  BUT AMONG THE GROUP WERE TWO OLDER MEN </p><p>WHO WERE MORE CIRCUMSPECT, BOTH WAR VETERANS IN THEIR </p><p>FORTIES WHO ARE TOO OLD OR WEAK TO WORK AT THE STEEL </p><p>WORKSHOPS.  ONE OF THE VETS, IN HIS MID-FORTIES, HAD </p><p>BEEN STATIONED WITH NORTH VIETNAMESE FORCES FOR FIVE </p><p>YEARS IN THE AREA AROUND THE THEN-U.S. BASE AT BIEN HOA </p><p>(FORMER SOUTH VIETNAM).  THE OTHER, IN HIS LATE </p><p>FORTIES, HAD SERVED AS A NORTH VIETNAMESE SOLDIER </p><p>PRIMARILY IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF TAY NINH.  THE </p><p>SECOND VET CANNOT WORK IN THE STEEL WORKSHOPS BECAUSE </p><p>HE HAS A BRAIN CONDITION STEMMING FROM THE WAR.  HE </p><p>SAID A U.S. BULLET ENTERED HIS TEMPLE DURING COMBAT </p><p>NEAR THE CAMBODIAN BORDER, SHOWING POLOFF THE STILL- </p><p>VISIBLE SCAR.  HE CARRIES SHRAPNEL INSIDE HIS HEAD. </p><p>CHANGES IN THE WEATHER, HE SAID, CAN CAUSE DEBILITATING </p><p>PAIN.  THEREFORE, HE WORKS AS A MOTORBIKE DRIVER, AND </p><p>EARNS NO MORE THAN VND 10,000 TO 15,000 (U.S. 70 CENTS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 07        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p>TO ONE DOLLAR) PER DAY. </p><p> </p><p>WILL UNIVERSITY STUDENT SON GRADUATE TO UNEMPLOYMENT? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) DASHING INTO A TINY STAND FOR BEEF NOODLE </p><p>SOUP, POLOFF MET THE OWNER, MR. DUY.  MR. DUY EARNS VND </p><p>700,000-800,000 (USD 50-57) PER MONTH FROM THE STAND, </p><p>BUT ALSO EARNS ABOUT VND ONE MILLION (USD 71) PER MONTH </p><p>FROM A SIDE JOB AS A MOTOR SCOOTER REPAIRMAN.  HE SAID </p><p>THE LOCAL ECONOMY IS DOING WELL, BUT HIS STAND IS </p><p>SUFFERING.  IT USED TO BE THE ONLY ONE IN THE AREA, BUT </p><p>WITH SO MANY OUTSIDERS MOVING IN FOR JOBS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>FROM THAI NGUYEN, OTHER SOUP STANDS HAVE OPENED UP TO </p><p>COMPETE WITH HIS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) HE SAID THAT DOING BUSINESS IS EASIER IN </p><p>VIETNAM TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH FEWER RESTRICTIONS </p><p>ON BUYING AND SELLING.  BUT THE BIG PROBLEM IS </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH.  HE OFFERED HIS </p><p>SON AS AN EXAMPLE.  HIS SON IS CURRENTLY STUDYING </p><p>EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY IN HANOI (MR. DUY HIMSELF </p><p>IS NOT COLLEGE-EDUCATED). BUT HE BELIEVES JOBS ARE </p><p>SCARCE IN EDUCATION IN THE HANOI AREA.  HE EXPECTS HIS </p><p>SON TO BE UNEMPLOYED WHEN HE GETS HIS DIPLOMA. </p><p> </p><p>A NOTE ON SOC SON </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) SOC SON, LOCATED ABOUT 40 KILOMETERS NORTH OF </p><p>THE CITY OF HANOI, IS CONSIDERED HANOI\'S POOREST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 08        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p>SUBURBAN DISTRICT.  IT IS BELIEVED TO CONTAIN THE </p><p>HIGHEST NUMBER OF POOR FAMILIES OF ANY HANOI DISTRICT. </p><p>ITS 243,300 RESIDENTS LIVE IN 25 COMMUNES ON A TOTAL </p><p>AREA OF 306 SQUARE KILOMETERS.  JOBS ARE PROVIDED BY </p><p>1,850 PRIVATE INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS BY THE INDUSTRIAL </p><p>ZONF HANOI\'S </p><p>LABORING CLASS.  ACCORDING TO GVN STATISTICS, ANNUAL </p><p>PER CAPITA INCOME IS VND 1,700,000 (USD 121). </p><p> </p><p>WOULD YOU BUY A "HONG DA" DREAM? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) PASSING DOWN HIGHWAY 3 TOWARDS SOC SON, </p><p>POLOFF STOPPED OFF AT THE SMALL MOTORSCOOTER SALES LOT </p><p>OF MRS. HUONG.  THE TWENTY OR SO MOTORBIKES ON DISPLAY </p><p>ALL LOOK LIKE HONDA DREAMS AND HONDA WAVES AT FIRST </p><p>GLANCE.  BUT CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS SHODDY </p><p>WORKMANSHIP, AND TRADEMARKS THAT SAY "HONG DA" OR </p><p>"HUNDA" RATHER THAN "HONDA," "DREAMY" RATHER THAN </p><p>"DREAM," "WAVY" RATHER THAN "WAVE." </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) MRS. HUONG EXPLAINED THAT THE BIKES WERE </p><p>MADE IN CHINA.  PURCHASED NEW, THEY SELL FOR ABOUT VND </p><p>11,000,000 (USD 785), VERSUS THE VND 33,000,000 (USD </p><p>2,400) NECESSARY TO BUY A NEW HONDA DREAM, THE MOST </p><p>POPULAR MOTORBIKE IN VIETNAM.  SHE OPENED HER LOT ON </p><p>THE FIRST OF THE YEAR, AND, SHE SAID, SALES HAVE BEEN </p><p>BRISK, ABOUT 15-20 BIKES A MONTH, FROM WHICH SHE MAKES </p><p>ABOUT VND 100,000 (USD 7) PROFIT ON EACH ONE. THEY ARE </p><p>SOLD MOSTLY TO THE OUTSIDERS WHO HAVE BEEN MOVING IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 09        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p>FROM POOR RURAL AREAS.  SHE SAID THAT SHE PAYS ABOUT </p><p>VND 300,000-400,000 (USD $21 TO 28) A MONTH IN TAXES. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) AREN\'T YOU BREAKING THE LAW BY SELLING THESE </p><p>COUNTERFEIT CHINESE-MADE KNOCKOFFS?, ASKED POLOFF.  NOT </p><p>AT ALL, REPLIED MRS. HUONG.  THEY ARE CLEARLY LABELED </p><p>AS "HUNDA" OR "HONG DA", NOT "HONDA," SO NO LAW IS </p><p>BROKEN, SHE ASSERTED.  (NOTE: CUSTOMERS ARE AWARE THAT </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU) FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD IN THE VILLAGE OF PHU </p><p>LO, A "TUC TUC" (THREE-WHEELED MOTOR CAB) DRIVER AT A </p><p>TEA STALL SAID THAT THE KIM ANH TEA PROCESSING PLANT </p><p>OPENED IN 1990 HAD ATTRACTED "A LOT" OF LOCALS TO THE </p><p>AREA, ESPECIALLY FROM NEARBY THAI NGUYEN.  HE SAID THE </p><p>THAI NGUYEN WORKERS SOMETIMES RETURNED TO THEIR </p><p>PROVINCE FOR WORK DURING THE VARIOUS HARVEST SEASONS. </p><p>HE SAID THE LOCAL ECONOMY TOOK A NOSE DIVE SOME YEARS </p><p>AGO FROM WHICH IT IS STILL RECOVERING DUE TO THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF THE TEA PROCESSING INDUSTRY: THE RAPIDLY </p><p>URBANIZING AREA USED TO BE A CENTER FOR TOBACCO </p><p>CULTIVATION.  BUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S ANTI-SMOKING </p><p>CAMPAIGN, THE DEMAND FOR TOBACCO DIMINISHED AND LOCAL </p><p>PEASANTS WERE LEFT WITH NO LIVELIHOOD UNTIL THE KIM ANH </p><p>PLANT OPENED. </p><p> </p><p>PEASANT FAMILY OF EIGHT LIVES ON 17 DOLLARS A YEAR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU) ALTHOUGH THE SOC SON AREA, LOCATED CLOSE TO </p><p>NOI BAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, IS RAPIDLY URBANIZING, </p><p>THERE IS STILL CONSIDERABLE AGRICULTURAL ACTFRUIT OFF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 10        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p>VINES, WHICH HE SAID HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY MICE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH MR. BAO\'S MELON PLOT IS 450 SQUARE METERS IN </p><p>AREA, HE SAID HIS EIGHT MEMBER FAMILY HAS BEEN </p><p>ALLOCATED A TOTAL OF 3,500 SQUARE METERS OF </p><p>AGRICULTURAL LAND OVERALL.  MOST OF THE REST IS DEVOTED </p><p>TO PADDY RICE. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (SBU) MR. BAO SAID THAT IN RETURN FOR THE LAND, HE </p><p>MUST PAY THE LOCAL COMMUNE 30 KILOGRAMS OF RICE PER </p><p>YEAR.  HE GETS A BETTER RETURN FROM HIS MELON PLOT THAN </p><p>FROM HIS RICE PADDIES, ABOUT VND 250,000 (USD 17) PER </p><p>HARVEST.  DURING THE SECOND HARVEST, HE PLANTS </p><p>CUCUMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (SBU) MR. BAO SAID THAT THE LAND HE HAS UNDER </p><p>CULTIVATION BRINGS IN ABOUT VND 650,000 (USD 45) PER </p><p>YEAR TOTAL, OF WHICH VND 400,000 (USD 28) MUST BE PAID </p><p>OUT IN TAXES.  (NOTE: WE BELIEVE BAO AND HIS FAMILY </p><p>HAVE ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INCOME, BEYOND THE USD 17 </p><p>PER YEAR WE CALCULATE THIS LEAVES HIM FROM AGRICULTURAL </p><p>SOURCES.  END NOTE).  HE SAID GOOD WEATHER IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS LED TO GOOD HARVESTS AND MORE INCOME.  HE HAS </p><p>ALSO BORROWED ABOUT VND 2-3 MILLION (USD 142-214) IN </p><p>VARIOUS LOANS AT 15-20 PERCENT INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>LOTS OF BUSINESS REPAIRING CARS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  (SBU) IN SOC SON, POLOFF VISITED A CAR REPAIR SHOP </p><p>OWNED BY MR. SON.  HE AND HIS STAFF WERE WORKING ON </p><p>PAINTING A 1989 HONDA FROM BLACK TO WHITE.  MR. SON\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 11        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p>SHOP EMPLOYS NINE MEN, MOST OF THEM LOCALS BUT A FEW </p><p>WHO HAVE "IMMIGRATED" HERE FROM NAM DINH. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (SBU) MR. SON SAID HIS SHOP IS VERY BUSY BECAUSE </p><p>TAXI SERVICES AT NEARBY NOI BAI AIRPORT NEED TO KEEP </p><p>THEIR CARS IN LIKE-NEW CONDITION.  HE SAID HE IS NOT </p><p>AWARE OF MANY PEOPLE MOVING INTO THE AREA BECAUSE </p><p>THERE IS ALREADY CONSIDERABLE UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG AREA </p><p>TAXI DRIVERS.  HE SAID THAT HE PAYS OUT ABOUT VND </p><p>100,000 (USD 7) A MONTH IN TAXES, WHICH, HE SAID, IS </p><p>LOW BECAUSE THE LOCAL TAX AUTHORITY GIVES FAMILY-OWNED </p><p>BUSINESSES SUCH AS HIS PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT MANY HANOI CAR OWNERS, SUCH AS THE OWNER OF THE </p><p>HONDA HE WAS PAINTING, COME OUT HERE FOR REPAIRS </p><p>BECAUSE PRICES ARE CHEAPER THAN IN THE CITY. </p><p> </p><p>WILL ELECTRICIAN SON LEAVE THE FARM FOR HANOI? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>25.  (SBU) WHILE EATING LUNCH AT A RUSTIC RICE SHOP, </p><p>POLOFF STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION WITH MR. LUONG.  MR. </p><p>LUONG IS A PROVINCE OF NGHE AN RICE FARMER UP FOR A FEW </p><p>DAYS TO ACCOMPANY HIS SON WHILE HE TAKES AN EXAM.  MR. </p><p>LUONG\'S SON WANTS TO ENTER ELECTRONIC SCHOOL NUMBER ONE </p><p>IN SOC SON, ONE OF ONLY TWO VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY TO TRAIN ELECTRICIANS. (THE OTHER IS IN HO CHI </p><p>MINH CITY).  TO DO SO, HE MUST PASS AN ALL DAY TEST IN </p><p>MATH AND PHYSICS. </p><p> </p><p>26.  (SBU) IF HIS SON PASSES THE EXAM, HE WILL ENTER A </p><p>TH~ THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 12        HANOI  01615  272040Z </p><p>MONEY?  "YES, I\'VE BEEN SAVING MONEY ALL MY LIFE FROM </p><p>THE SALE OF CHICKENS AND DUCKS ON THE SIDE OF RICE </p><p>CULTIVATION."  LUONG IS A CATHOLIC, AND IS PROUD THAT </p><p>HIS SON MAY BE GETTING THIS ADVANCED EDUCATION, </p><p>SOMETHING FEW NORTHERN CATHOLICS OF HIS GENERATION </p><p>COULD OBTAIN. </p><p> </p><p>27.  (SBU) COMMENT.  WHILE THE INCOME AMOUNTS CITED </p><p>ABOVE APPEAR IMPOSSIBLY MEAGER BY U.S. STANDARDS, THEY </p><p>ARE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE, A MOSTLY AGRARIAN PEOPLE, EARN.  THIS IS </p><p>WHY AREAS LIKE DONG ANH AND SOC SON ARE FILLING UP WITH </p><p>"IMMIGRANTS."  SOME FOREIGNERS AND VIETNAMESE </p><p>INTELLECTUALS WAX NOSTALGIC FOR THE SMALL, QUIET HANOI </p><p>OF YESTERYEAR.  BUT THAT HANOI HELD LITTLE ATTRACTION </p><p>FOR POOR FARMERS FROM THE HINTERLAND, SINCE THERE WERE </p><p>FEW JOBS.  TODAY, WITH GOVERNMENT CONTROLS ON INTERNAL </p><p>MIGRATION PRACTICALLY A DEAD LETTER, IT IS HARDER FOR </p><p>THE RURAL POOR TO RESIST THE ALLURE OF A HIGHER INCOME </p><p>IN THE BIG CITY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HARTER </p><p></p></div>
