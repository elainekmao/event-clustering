<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000959 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: 5/3/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: Agreement on Strengthened Cease-fire in Sierra </p><p>Leone </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER, REASONS 1.5(B/D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary. On May 2 the ECOWAS Committee of Six, </p><p>the UN, and the Sierra Leone Government reached a </p><p>reaffirmation of the November 10, 2000 cease-fire agreement </p><p>in Sierra Leone with RUF representatives lead by Omrie </p><p>Golley.  According to sources at ECOWAS, The RUF committed </p><p>itself to the dismantling of road blocks, a pull back from </p><p>tense areas of the border with Guinea in the Kambia area, </p><p>and the hand over of seized weapons, all by the end of May. </p><p>The Committee of Six and the GOSL agreed to allow the RUF </p><p>to conduct a regional fund-raising tour for political party </p><p>organization, subject to "cooperative behavior" and the </p><p>lifting of the UN travel ban.  The parties also re- </p><p>committed themselves to the DDR process.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The ECOWAS Committee of Six (Ghana, Nigeria, </p><p>Liberia, Mali, Togo, Guinea not present) together with </p><p>representatives of the GOSL, the UN, and the ECOWAS </p><p>secretariat, met with representatives of the RUF on May 2 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>in Abuja.  After an approximately eight-hour session at the </p><p>ECOWAS Secretariat, the parties agreed upon several </p><p>concrete provisions to strengthen the November 10, 2000 </p><p>cease-fire.  The RUF agreed to the dismantling of </p><p>roadblocks, a RUF pull back from tense border areas near </p><p>Kambia, and a hand-over of seized weapons stocks, all by </p><p>the end of May.  The parties recommitted themselves to the </p><p>Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) </p><p>program.  Troops pulled back from the Kambia area were to </p><p>enter DDR camps.  An overall timetable for this would be </p><p>determined at a meeting between the RUF and the GOSL in </p><p>Freetown on May 15.  An "internal memorandum" has been </p><p>signed in accordance with the agreements reached on May 2, </p><p>but will not be distributed to the public.  ECOWAS </p><p>personnel would not release this document to us or to other </p><p>diplomatic personnel, but were willing to discuss its </p><p>provisions, as noted above. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The negotiations at ECOWAS by all accounts occurred </p><p>in a "cordial" and productive atmosphere.  The RUF </p><p>representatives, according to Colonel Dixon Dikio, ECOWAS </p><p>military advisor, were "surprisingly conciliatory." </p><p>Henrietta Didigu, staff attorney in the Office of the Legal </p><p>Advisor at ECOWAS, who helped draft the new agreement, </p><p>termed the RUF behavior a recognition that the May 2 ECOWAS </p><p>talks were "the only game in town."  ECOWAS Director of </p><p>Information Adrienne Diop noted that, "The RUF realizes the </p><p>war could go on forever and they are tired of it; that </p><p>makes them more reasonable."  Even the GOSL delegation </p><p>expressed satisfaction with the talks, appearing relaxed </p><p>and optimistic in the hallways of the ECOWAS secretariat at </p><p>the end of the long evening. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The RUF did raise some issues not strictly linked </p><p>to the November 10, 2000 cease-fire agreement, including </p><p>release of RUF prisoners, the presence of "foreign troops" </p><p>on Sierra Leone soil (a reference to British training </p><p>assistance to the GOSL armed forces) and their need to </p><p>transform themselves into an active political party.  The </p><p>Committee of Six and the GOSL reportedly agreed to a </p><p>regional fund-raising trip by the RUF to fund political </p><p>party organization, this contingent on RUF "cooperative </p><p>behavior."  The GOSL would issue a public call for the </p><p>lifting of the UN travel ban, should such "cooperative </p><p>behavior" result, and work to remove "legal impediments" to </p><p>the RUF registering as a political party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The cooperative atmosphere at the May 2 talks </p><p>mirrored May 1 meetings convened by ECOWAS to prepare for </p><p>the RUF sessions, in which the Committee of Six, the GOSL, </p><p>the UN and ECOWAS staff participated.  Well aware that the </p><p>RUF had not been in compliance with many provisions of the </p><p>cease-fire, the parties sought ways to encourage RUF </p><p>compliance and establish concrete time-frames, rather than </p><p>simply document violations and accord responsibility. </p><p>However, the unwillingness of ECOWAS to release the agreed- </p><p>upon text signed late on the evening of May 2 may signal </p><p>some sensitivity concerning lack of compliance with the </p><p>original cease-fire agreement, or perhaps the existence of </p><p>other agreement elements not disclosed by ECOWAS personnel </p><p>in conversations with us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment.  The cease-fire in Sierra Leone does </p><p>appear to be the only game in town.  Now we shall see if </p><p>the rules of the game, as reconfigured by the original </p><p>signatories to the November 10, 2000 agreement, will be </p><p>obeyed by the RUF.  They have gained some further measure </p><p>of recognition of their status as a negotiating partner of </p><p>the GOSL, as sanctioned by ECOWAS and the UN in Abuja this </p><p>week.  Whether the RUF can seize this latest opportunity to </p><p>act as a real partner in securing the cease-fire, and move </p><p>beyond it to constructing a lasting peace in Sierra Leone, </p><p>should be revealed in the next few weeks.  Guinea\'s </p><p>apparent absence was unfortunate but need not necessarily </p><p>diminish significantly the week\'s accomplishments.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  In a May 3 meeting, NSA Aliyu Mohammed told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter that President Obasanjo had had breakfast </p><p>with RUF members and GOSL Ministers that morning.  The NSA </p><p>added that the group would be returning to Freetown on May </p><p>4, all on the same plane.  According to Mohammed, the RUF </p><p>and GOSL Ministers had said that President Obasanjo "had a </p><p>mandate" to mediate the conflict in Sierra Leone, that </p><p>three-quarters of the conflict was solved, and that all </p><p>that remained to be done was to demobilize and reintegrate </p><p>combatants. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
