Reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) "Prime Minister" </p><p>Barham Salih met with Operation Northern Watch POLAD March 7 </p><p>in Ankara.  Salih planned to raise with Turkish MFA and </p><p>military officials later in the day what he characterized as </p><p>the strong, grass-roots objections of the vast majority of </p><p>northern Iraq\'s people to any Turkish intervention there, and </p><p>to note that Turkey was, by planning a cross-border move and </p><p>discussing it in public, making Kurdistan Democratic Party </p><p>(KDP) leader Masoud Barzani a local hero.  Salih also planned </p><p>to tell the Turks that Turkey\'s humanitarian assistance plan </p><p>needed to be coordinated and shared with the KDP and PUK, who </p><p>administer the area, in order to harmonize efforts, avoid </p><p>duplication and waste resources, and to avoid </p><p>misunderstandings.  So far, he told us, no such effort has </p><p>been made.  When we asked him if there were plans for </p><p>follow-up to the TGS-KDP-PUK-Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) </p><p>meeting on military planning that took place Feb. 17 in </p><p>Silopi, Turkey, Salih said the Iraqi Kurds would only agree </p><p>if the USG sent a representative to the next round.  On </p><p>Kirkuk, Salih said that the PUK could prevent displaced Kurds </p><p>from rushing back to Kirkuk if Washington made a public </p><p>commitment to the return of all the displaced through a </p><p>legal, political process.  Salih briefed us on his detailed </p><p>proposal to unify KDP and PUK administrations now being </p><p>considered by the KDP.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Ideally, Zero Turkish Troops </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) In Ankara for talks with Turkish MFA and military </p><p>officials, PUK "PM" Salih met with ONW POLAD March 7.  Salih </p><p>said he would leave Turkey for Washington March 8 and that he </p><p>would be in Washington for a week, and asked for assistance </p><p>in getting as many appointments in Washington as possible. </p><p>We asked Salih how he would like to see Turkish involvement </p><p>in northern Iraq during possible US military operations. </p><p>Salih replied, "Ideally, there would be zero Turkish military </p><p>involvement.  If push comes to shove and the coalition needs </p><p>Turkey to be involved, we will need assurances that our </p><p>political rights will be protected, that Turkey will not get </p><p>involved in Iraqi Kurd-Turkoman politics, and that we will </p><p>have the right to tell the Turks to go home.  We will need to </p><p>have clearly defined and agreed to Turkey\'s mission, rules of </p><p>engagement and depth of presence." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Military and Humanitarian Coordination Lacking </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) We asked Salih if there were plans for another </p><p>round of Turkey-KDP/PUK-ITF military talks to follow up the </p><p>Feb. 17 Silopi meeting.  Salih said the Iraqi Kurds were only </p><p>interested in such a meeting if the US were represented as </p><p>well.  He said the US needed to tell the Turks and the Iraqi </p><p>Kurds at the same time "the way it was going to be."  He </p><p>noted that Turkey still had not shared with the KDP or PUK </p><p>Turkish plans for humanitarian assistance, which Turkey </p><p>claimed was why its troops needed to cross the border.  Salih </p><p>planned to say to the Turks that such plans must be shared </p><p>and harmonized with KDP and PUK humanitarian assistance plans </p><p>to maximize effectiveness, minimize waste and duplication and </p><p>avoid misunderstandings.  He said this was not a political </p><p>matter, but one of common sense and careful use of limited </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Turkey Making Barzani a Hero </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) Salih, who met with KDP leader Masoud Barzani March </p><p>5, said he had never seen Barzani so angry, emotional and </p><p>irreconcilable about anything as he was about the prospect of </p><p>Turkish military intervention.  Salih told us he could not </p><p>overstate the depth of anger among the people - not just the </p><p>politically involved - in northern Iraq toward Turkey, and </p><p>that Barzani was dangerously playing on that anger.  Salih </p><p>planned to tell the Turks that they were making Masoud </p><p>Barzani a local hero by threatening military intervention in </p><p>northern Iraq.  Salih believed there was potential for a "war </p><p>within a war" between the Iraqi Kurds and the Turks.  Such a </p><p>situation, he said, would help Iran, and the Iranians would </p><p>play that card to complicate things for the US.  He suspected </p><p>the recent movement of SCIRI\'s Badr Brigade forces into </p><p>northern Iraq may have been designed in part by Iran to draw </p><p>in the Turks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Badr Brigade: Iranian Surrogate or Opposition Fighters? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Turning to the Badr Brigade presence, Salih </p><p>confirmed that approximately 1,000 troops were now located </p><p>near Darbandikan in northern Iraq.  They were there, he said, </p><p>under the terms of a 1996 SCIRI-PUK agreement to coordinate </p><p>military activity against Saddam Hussein.  When we asked what </p><p>he thought their motivation was for deploying into northern </p><p>Iraq, he replied, "everyone wants a piece of the pie."  Salih </p><p>said the PUK leadership was split on whether they represented </p><p>an Iranian surrogate or a legitimate Iraqi opposition force, </p><p>but the PUK\'s hand against Iran was too weak to resist them, </p><p>given the 1996 agreement.  Salih said he expected the Badr </p><p>troops to cooperate against Saddam during the fight, be a </p><p>possible source of pro-Iranian trouble-making during the </p><p>transition period, but to assume a legitimate Iraqi role in </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Need US Commitment on Returnees to Kirkuk </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) When we asked Salih if he thought the PUK could </p><p>ensure that displaced Kurds would not storm back to Kirkuk as </p><p>soon as it was liberated (which could trigger a major </p><p>complicating Turkish response), Salih said that to do so, the </p><p>PUK would need a public statement from the US guaranteeing a </p><p>political/legal process of restitution and repatriation that </p><p>committed to getting people back to their original homes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>KDP-PUK Unification Plans </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S/NF) We asked Salih for details on Ref A plans to unify </p><p>KDP and PUK administrations and peshmerga forces.  Salih said </p><p>that for now, the two parties have agreed to have a joint </p><p>political-military committee comprised of Masoud Barzani and </p><p>Jalal Talabani plus four reps from each side.  The PUK reps </p><p>will be Salih, Khosrat Rasul Ali, Dr. Fuad Masoum, and </p><p>Nushirwan Mustafa.  Salih did not know who the KDP would </p><p>propose for their reps.  Salih said he had sent a letter to </p><p>Masoud Barzani proposing the following unification plan: The </p><p>administration would have a single "PM" (the KDP had the </p><p>option of deciding who that would be); a unified cabinet </p><p>including at least one Arab minister; two "Deputy PM\'s" - one </p><p>Turkoman and one Assyrian (with the ITF to be given first </p><p>chance at the Turkoman slot - if they refuse, the slot would </p><p>be offered to another Turkoman); and ministries and </p><p>subordinate offices would be integrated slowly, one at a </p><p>time.  Salih\'s plan keeps regional finances separate until </p><p>resolution of differences over revenue-sharing can be </p><p>bridged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S/NF) Salih argued that rapid implementation of this plan </p><p>would allow the KDP and PUK to consolidate their position and </p><p>place them in a powerful spot to advocate federalism, </p><p>including their areas as one geographic federal unit in the </p><p>post-Saddam environment.  Masoud Barzani told Salih that the </p><p>two sides needed to sit down and discuss the proposal, and </p><p>Salih believed Barzani was unenthusiastic, in part because he </p><p>is riding on a ground-swell of popularity for opposing </p><p>Turkey.  Salih said KDP "PM" Nechirvan Barzani was unhappy </p><p>with offering a "Deputy PM" slot to the ITF.  Still, Salih </p><p>said, unification could move quickly if it were pushed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>A US-KDP-PKK Plot Against the PUK? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S/NF) Salih told us that a few days ago the local Turkish </p><p>liaison in Sulaymaniyah had come to him and suggested that </p><p>the US, the KDP and the PKK/KADEK were working together on a </p><p>secret plan to marginalize the PUK.  We assured him this was </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>not true.  He said he knew it was not, but wondered what the </p><p>Turks were up to in suggesting it.  Finally, he offered the </p><p>comment that if the Turks thought ITF Chairman Sanan Aga was </p><p>the man to protect Turkey\'s interests, the Turks were sorely </p><p>mistaken. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
