PREVIOUS </p><p>HIGH-EVEL VISITORS HAVE INCLUDED THEN-PRESIDENT MITTERAN </p><p>IN 1993 AND PRESIDENT CHIRAC JUST BEFORE THE 197 </p><p>FRANCOPHONE SUMMIT IN HANOI.  ON THE VIETNAMES SIDE, THEN- </p><p>PRIME MINISTERS PHAM VAN DONG AND PIME MINISTER VO VAN KIET </p><p>VISITED FRANCE IN 1977 ND 1993, RESPECTIVELY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>VITNAM A "PRIORITY" </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.

MUCH OF FRANCE\'S ODA IS IN THE FORM OF </p><p>CONCESSIONAL LOANS, HOWEVER.  FRANCE WILL LIKELY PROVIDE UP </p><p>TO USD 30 MILLION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS A "LOAN" FOR THE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF THE PHU MY II POWER PLANT IN SOUTHERN </p><p>VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE, FRANCE RANKS SIXTH AMONG </p><p>VIETNAM\'S FOREIGN INVESTORS, WITH 120 PROJECTS CAPITALIZED </p><p>AT ABOUT USD TWO BILLION.  (NOTE:  IN COMPARISON, THE U.S. </p><p>RANKS 15TH, BUT MUCH US INVESTMENT COMES FROM US </p><p>SUBSIDIARIES IN THE REGION AND SHOWS UP AS THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02738  01 OF 03  130720Z </p><p>INVESTMENT, IN PARTICULAR FROM SINGAPORE.

VIETNAM\'S EXPORTS </p><p>INCLUDE FOOTWEAR, TEXTILES, AND AGRICULTURAL AS WELL AS FOOD </p><p>PRODUCTS, WHILE IT IMPORTS MACHINERY, APPLIANCES, AND </p><p>PHARMACEUTICALS FROM FRANCE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  FRANCE AND VIETNAM STILL ENJOY SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL </p><p>TIES.  FRANCE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE ANNUAL HUE FESTIVAL </p><p>AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER CULTURAL EVENTS.  THE NUMBER OF </p><p>FRENCH TOURISTS HAS INCREASED FROM 25,000 IN 1992 TO 80,000 </p><p>IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002, ACCORDING TO THE US- </p><p>VIETNAM TRADE COUNCIL, MAKING FRANCE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF </p><p>TOURISTS AMONG EU MEMBER STATES.  FRANCE PROVIDES </p><p>SCHOLARSHIPS FOR ABOUT 400 VIETNAMESE STUDENTS ANNUALLY. </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 400,000 VIETNAMESE -- MAINLY OLDER PEOPLE -- </p><p>STILL SPEAK FRENCH.  HOWEVER, AS DR.

ACCORDING </p><p>TO EMBOFF FARCOT, THE FRANCO-VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY IS IN </p><p>GENERAL "FAVORABLY DISPOSED TOWARDS THE BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP."  SPECIFICALLY, FARCOT CITED THE "CONSIDERABLE </p><p>MORAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT" AMONG THESE RESIDENTS FOR THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT F A FRENCH-VIETNAMESE UNIVERSITY IN HO CHI </p><p>MINH CTY.  HE OPINED THAT, SINCE MOST OF THE VIETNAMESE HAD </p><p>LIVED IN FRANCE FOR A LONG TIME, THEY DIFFER FROM THE US- </p><p>BASED VIET KIEU COMMUNITY, WHICH IS COMPOSED MAINLY OF MORE </p><p>RECENT REFUGEES. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>MEET AND SIGN </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  DURING HIS VISIT, LUONG HELD A NUMBER OF MEETINGS </p><p>WITH SENIOR FRENCH OFFIALS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT CHIRAC, </p><p>PRIME MINISTER JEAN PIERRE RAFFRIN, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>CHAIRMAN JEAN-LOUIS DEBRE, SENATE LEADER CHRISTIAN PONCELET, </p><p>AND THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT\'S EXTERNAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE </p><p>CHAIRMAN AND FORMER PRIME MINISTER EDWARD BALLADUR. </p><p> </p><p>9.

(U)  TRINH DUC DU, MFA\'S EUROPE II DIRECTOR, SAID THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT CHIRAC HAD CONFIRMED TO PRESIDENT LUONG THAT </p><p>FRANCE "HIGHLY APPRECIATES" THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  HE </p><p>ALSO ASSURED LUONG OF FRANCE\'S CONTINUED FOR SUPPORT FOR </p><p>VIETNAM\'S ACCESSION TO THE WTO, A REMARK WIDELY REPORTED IN </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE PRESS.

(THIS COMMENT </p><p>WAS NOT REPORTED IN THE STATE-CONTROLLED VIETNAMESE PRESS, </p><p>HOWEVER.)  EMBOFF FARCOT NOTED THAT "WE CONTINUE TO PUSH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02738  02 OF 03  130720Z </p><p>VIETNAM TO ACCELERATE ITS ECONOMIC REFORMS," ESPECIALLY </p><p>GIVEN THAT "SOME ELEMENTS" OF THE FRENCH BUSINESS COMMUNITY </p><p>REMAIN "NERVOUS" ABOUT INVESTING IN VIETNAM.  AT THE TIME OF </p><p>THE VISIT, A FRENCH PRESS REPORT CITED VIETNAM\'S </p><p>BUREAUCRACY, CORRUPTION, AND THE "WEIGHT OF THE STATE" AS </p><p>FACTORS DRIVING AWAY POTENTIAL INVESTORS.  DR.KHOAT SAID </p><p>SEPARATELY THAT PRESIDENT LUONG "WAS NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR </p><p>CHIRAC\'S COMMENT."  DR.

(U)  BOTH SIDES STATED THEIR COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING </p><p>TERRORISM.  DURING THE VISIT, VIETNAM REITERATED ITS OFT- </p><p>STATED POSITION THAT ANTI-TERRORISM MEASURES AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION MUST CONFORM TO THE UN CHARTER AND </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.  ACCORDING TO A </p><p>VIETNAMESE PRESS REPORT, LUONG SPECIFICALLY "PROTESTED" ANY </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM ACTIONS THAT "INTERFERE WITH THE INTERNAL </p><p>AFFAIRS OF INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES." </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>ADOPTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  WHILE NOT REPORTED IN THE STATE-ONTROLLED LOCAL </p><p>MEDIA, THE ISSUE OF ADOPTIONS ALSO CAME UP DURING THE VISIT, </p><p>EMBOFF FARCOT AND DR. KHOAT SAID SEPARATELY.  IT IS AN </p><p>"EMOTIONAL" ISSUE IN FRANCE, ACCORDING TO FARCOT, WHO NOTED </p><p>THAT, IN THE LATE 1990S, THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BECAME </p><p>CONCERNED OVER STORIES ABOUT BABY TRAFFICKING AND CORRUPTION </p><p>IN THE ADOPTION PROCESS.  THE TWO GOVERNMENTS SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>SIGNED A BILATERAL AGREEMENT, THE RESULT OF WHICH WAS TO </p><p>BRING THE ADOPTION PROCESS VIRTUALLY TO A HALT, MUCH TO THE </p><p>CHAGRIN OF PROSPECTIVE PARENTS IN FRANCE.  EMBOFF FARCOT </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT ONLY "10-15 BABIES WERE ADOPTED BY FRENCH </p><p>CITIZENS THIS PAST YEAR."  DR. KHOAT EXPLAINED THAT THE </p><p>AGREEMENT WAS DESIGN TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF PROVINCIAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES OVER THE ADOPTION PROCESS AND TO ELIMINATE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02738  03 OF 03  130721Z </p><p>"CONTRIBUTIONS" MADE DIRECTLY FROM ADOPTION MIDDLEMEN TO </p><p>VIETNAMESE PROVINCIAL AGENCIES AND ADOPTION INSTITUTIONS. </p><p>EMBOFF FARCOT SEPARATELY CLAIMED THAT PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>HAD PUT UP "MANY ROADBLOCKS" IN THE WAKE OF THE AGREEMENT. </p><p>(NOTE:  CURRENTLY, ADOPTIVE PARENTS FROM MANY OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES CAN MAKE SUCH "CONTRIBUTIONS."  AS A RESULT, AT </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL BABIES ARE NOW BEING DIRECTED TOWARDS </p><p>THOSE PARENTS AND AWAY FROM FRENCH PARENTS.   ACCORDING TO A </p><p>2001 GVN DECREE, ALL COUNTRIES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A </p><p>BILATERAL ADOPTION AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM BY JANUARY 2003. </p><p>THIS SHOULD EVENTUALLY RE-LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD.
