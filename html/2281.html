<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 001381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/PD/MSPEER </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR DRL/IRF </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR INR/EAP/SEA AND INR/IL/B </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p>SECDEF FOR ISA/EA/ABLAGG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KIRF, PINR, PREL, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR, ETMIN </p><p>SUBJECT: RANKING POLITBURO MEMBER TALKS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, BILATERAL RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: AS THE FOURTH-RANKING MEMBER IN VIETNAM\'S </p><p>POLITBURO, HO CHI MINH CITY\'S COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY </p><p>NGUYEN MINH TRIET IS A MAJOR POLITICAL FORCE.  IN A </p><p>MEETING WITH CONSUL GENERAL, TRIET EMPHATICALLY </p><p>DEFENDED VIETNAM\'S RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM.  BUT HE INVITED CG TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON </p><p>THESE AND OTHER ISSUES "WHERE GAPS REMAIN", IN AN </p><p>EFFORT TO IMPROVE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>TRIET: "WE SHOULD NOT AVOID RAISING SENSITIVE ISSUES" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2. CONSUL GENERAL PAID AN INITIAL COURTESY CALL ON MR. </p><p>NGUYEN MINH TRIET ON DECEMBER 10, AT HCMC COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY HEADQUARTERS.  TRIET OPENED THE MEETING, NOTING </p><p>THAT HE BELIEVED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILATERAL </p><p>TRADE AGREEMENT WILL OPEN A "NEW ERA" OF IMPROVED </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN VIETNAM AND THE U.S. </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION WILL PREPARE VIETNAM FOR ACCESSION TO </p><p>THE WTO - "THE NEXT STEP" -- HE SAID, AND HE LOOKED </p><p>FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CONGEN DURING THAT PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>3. LIKENING THE U.S. AND VIETNAM TO FAMILY MEMBERS, </p><p>TRIET SAID IT IS NORMAL FOR TWO COUNTRIES TO HAVE </p><p>DIFFERENCES ON CERTAIN ISSUES.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT AVOID CONFRONTING ISSUES WHERE </p><p>THERE ARE "GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING," ESPECIALLY WHEN SUCH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01381  01 OF 02  120135Z </p><p>DISCUSSIONS COULD MOVE THE TWO SIDES CLOSER TOGETHER. </p><p>HE SAID NEITHER SIDE SHOULD HESITATE TO RAISE SENSITIVE </p><p>MATTERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. CG THEN ASKED TRIET WHAT HE THOUGHT WERE THE MOST </p><p>CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  TRIET DID NOT TAKE THE BAIT.  HE </p><p>RESPONDED ONLY THAT WE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS TO </p><p>PROBLEMS THROUGH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING; WE SHOULD NOT </p><p>MAKE MOUNTAINS OUT OF MOLEHILLS; AND WE SHOULD NOT </p><p>ALLOW DIFFERENCES TO TURN US INTO OPPONENTS. </p><p> </p><p>CG: "THEN LET\'S TALK ABOUT THICH QUANG DO... </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. CG SAID SHE WOULD TAKE UP TRIET\'S INVITATION TO </p><p>RAISE A COUPLE OF SENSITIVE ISSUES.  SHE NOTED THAT </p><p>THICH QUANG DO, THE SECOND-RANKING MONK OF THE BANNED </p><p>UNIFIED BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM, HAS BEEN UNDER </p><p>HOUSE ARREST AND HAS NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO RECEIVE </p><p>VISITORS SINCE JUNE.  REMINDING TRIET THAT THE GERMAN </p><p>EMBASSY HAD BEEN REFUSED A VISIT, SHE THEN ASKED TRIET </p><p>IF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO VISIT DO. </p><p> </p><p>6. TRIET SAID HE WAS PROUD OF VIETNAM\'S RECORD ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION.  VIETNAM STRUGGLED FOR </p><p>CENTURIES FOR INDEPENDENCE, AND NOW THAT INDEPENDENCE </p><p>HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, HE SAID, PEOPLE KNOW TRUE FREEDOM. </p><p>ONE HALF MILLION CATHOLICS, MANY MORE BUDDHISTS, AND </p><p>MEMBERS OF SEVERAL OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN HCMC HAVE </p><p>THE FREEDOM TO WORSHIP, DECLARED TRIET.  BUT, HE ADDED, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01381  01 OF 02  120135Z </p><p>THERE ARE A VERY FEW PERSONS WHO ABUSE THESE FREEDOMS. </p><p>IN DOING SO THEY BREAK THE LAW.  THESE ARE CIVIL CASES, </p><p>HE SAID, NOT CASES OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND ARE DEALT </p><p>WITH ACCORDING TO VIETNAMESE LAW. </p><p> </p><p>7. CG REPLIED THAT NO MATTER HOW VIETNAM MIGHT </p><p>CHARACTERIZE THICH QUANG DO, HE IS AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FIGURE AND MANY PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT HIS HEALTH AND WELL BEING. </p><p> </p><p>8. TRIET DECLARED THAT DO WAS IN GOOD HEALTH, AND THAT </p><p>THE GVN IS TAKING GOOD CARE OF HIM, SENDING A PHYSICIAN </p><p>REGULARLY TO MONITOR HIS HEALTH.  HE WAS FULLY AWARE </p><p>THAT SHOULD ANYTHING GO WRONG WITH DO\'S HEALTH, "THERE </p><p>ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT </p><p>SITUATION" TO MAKE VIETNAM LOOK BAD. </p><p> </p><p>9. CG SAID SHE WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE TRIET AT HIS WORD </p><p>THAT DO\'S HEALTH WAS BEING LOOKED AFTER AND WOULD </p><p>REPORT THIS TO THE EMBASSY AND WASHINGTON.  THIS DID </p><p>NOT MEAN, HOWEVER, THAT SHE WOULD NOT SEEK TO VISIT DO </p><p>IN THE FUTURE.  TRIET LET THAT PASS. </p><p> </p><p>...AND ACCESS TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS" </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. CG TOLD TRIET THAT SHE HAD PLANNED TO VISIT THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS THIS WEEK, BUT DAK LAK AND KON TUM </p><p>PROVINCES HAD, LATE LAST FRIDAY, NOTIFIED THE CONGEN </p><p>THAT THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES WERE TOO BUSY </p><p>TO RECEIVE HER.  SHE NOTED HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR </p><p>DIPLOMATS TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL, MEET PEOPLE, AND REPORT </p><p>ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY ON WHAT THEY SEE AND HEAR. SHE </p><p>ASKED TRIET\'S ADVICE ON HOW TO BEST PROCEED. </p><p> </p><p>11. TRIET ACKNOWLEDGED THAT, EARLIER IN THE YEAR, </p><p>TRAVEL TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WAS RESTRICTED BECAUSE </p><p>OF SECURITY PROBLEMS.  HE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT IT WAS </p><p>CURRENT STATE POLICY "NOT TO PROHIBIT ANYONE" FROM </p><p>VISITING THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. HE PROMISED TO VOICE </p><p>HIS SUPPORT OF CONGEN TRAVEL TO THE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>12. TRIET ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS LAGGED BEHIND MOST </p><p>OF VIETNAM\'S OTHER PROVINCES.  HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT WITHIN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>GROUPS LAGGED BEHIND ETHNIC VIETNAMESE KINH, BOTH </p><p>ECONOMICALLY AND EDUCATIONALLY.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE </p><p>GVN HAD DEVISED POLICIES FOR IMPROVING THE LIVING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01381  02 OF 02  120135Z </p><p>STANDARDS FOR THE CENTRAL HIGHLAND MINORITY GROUPS AND </p><p>THAT, COMPARED TO 25 YEARS AGO, THEIR SITUATION HAD </p><p>IMPROVED GREATLY. </p><p> </p><p>13. THE UNREST IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OCCURRED, </p><p>ACCORDING TO TRIET, BECAUSE OUTSIDERS ENCOURAGED SOME </p><p>DISSATISFIED PERSONS TO AGITATE FOR AN AUTONOMOUS </p><p>STATE.  TRIET SAID VIETNAM WOULD BE FIRM AGAINST ANY </p><p>NOTION OF AUTONOMY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME WOULD CONTINUE </p><p>TO WORK TOWARD IMPROVING THE LIVES OF ITS ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES.  VIETNAM IS A UNIFIED COUNTRY, HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED, AND WILL REMAIN SO. </p><p> </p><p>BIONOTE </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. TRIET WAS BORN IN BINH DUONG (FORMERLY SONG BE) </p><p>PROVINCE, JUST NORTH OF SAIGON, AND GREW UP IN SAIGON. </p><p>DURING THE WAR YEARS, HE WORKED FOR THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY MASS MOBILIZATION COMMITTEE, SOUTHERN </p><p>BUREAU.  DURING 1976-1987, HE WORKED FOR THE CENTRAL HO </p><p>CHI MINH YOUTH UNION.  IN 1991, HE BECAME SECRETARY OF </p><p>THE SONG BE PROVINCE COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEE, AND </p><p>FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER 1997, HE WAS VICE-CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>THE HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEE (WHILE CONCURRENTLY </p><p>VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE).  FROM </p><p>HCMC, HE WENT TO HANOI TO HEAD THE POWERFUL MASS </p><p>MOBILIZATION COMMITTEE OF THE CENTRAL COMMUNIST PARTY. </p><p>IN JANUARY 2000, HE RETURNED TO HCMC AS THE CITY\'S </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF.  IN APRIL 2001, HE MOVED UP TO </p><p>NUMBER FOUR IN THE POLITBURO, OUTRANKED ONLY BY THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01381  02 OF 02  120135Z </p><p>PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER AND COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE TRIET WILL BECOME </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>VIETNAM\'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER. HE IS 59-YEARS OLD. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15. TRIET PROVED TRUE TO HIS REPUTATION OF BEING </p><p>ENGAGING AND PERSONABLE, IF SOMEWHAT DOCTRINAIRE.  HE </p><p>DID NOT BAT AN EYELASH WHEN THE CG SAID WE WOULD HOLD </p><p>HIM TO HIS WORD ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THICH QUANG DO. </p><p>CONGEN WILL STILL SEEK TO VISIT DO.  CG IS MOVING AHEAD </p><p>WITH HER TRIP TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  RESPONDING TO </p><p>TRIET\'S NUMEROUS OFFERS TO DISCUSS SENSITIVE BILATERAL </p><p>ISSUES "OR ANY OTHER PROBLEMS", CG SAID PERHAPS IN A </p><p>MORE INFORMAL SETTING, OVER LUNCH OR DINNER.  TRIET </p><p>SORT OF SAID "UUHMM".  CONGEN WILL  SEEK AN APPROPRIATE </p><p>TIME TO MEET WITH TRIET TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>HIM.  YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
