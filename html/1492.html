<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000494 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/24/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: NO FORMAL MEETINGS YET BETWEEN DRC ALLIES AND </p><p>DRC GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 450 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES EARL M. IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POLOFF SPOKE TO MAXWELL CHIKOROWONDO, THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE MFA\'S DRC DESK OFFICER, ON JANUARY 24. </p><p>CHIKOROWONDO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM KINSHASA AND LUANDA, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00494  241418Z </p><p>WHERE HE ACCOMPANIED PRESIDENT MUGABE TO KABILA\'S </p><p>FUNERAL AND THE DRC ALLIES\' MEETING.  CHIKOROWONDO TOLD </p><p>POLOFF THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE AND THE OTHER ALLIED HEADS </p><p>OF STATE DID NOT/NOT HOLD A FORMAL MEETING WITH JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA.  THEY MERELY "CHATTED" WITH HIM DURING THE </p><p>FUNERAL.  THE ZIMBABWE MFA IS CURRENTLY WAITING FOR </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS TO ARRANGE A LUSAKA SIGNATORIES MEETING, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE DESK OFFICER.  HE ALSO REPORTED THAT </p><p>THE YOUNGER KABILA WAS NOT SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT, BUT </p><p>THAT HE PROBABLY WILL BE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  IN </p><p>LUANDA ON JANUARY 21, THE HEADS OF STATE AGREED THAT </p><p>THERE IS "NO GOING BACK" ON THE PEACE PROCESS, AND THAT </p><p>THEY WILL DO ALL THEY CAN TO ENSURE THAT IT GOES </p><p>FORWARD, CHIKOROWONDO REPORTED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON THE SUBJECT OF THE INVESTIGATION INTO </p><p>KABILA\'S MURDER, THE DRC DESK OFFICER SAID IT IS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO JUDGE HOW LONG THE INVESTIGATION WILL TAKE. </p><p>HE BELIEVES THAT ANGOLA HAD NOTHING TO WITH THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION BECAUSE, AS HE PUT IT, "ALL THE ALLIES </p><p>WORKED WELL WITH KABILA."  CHIKOROWONDO WAS LESS </p><p>SANGUINE ABOUT UGANDA AND RWANDA.  WHEN ASKED IF THEIR </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAD TRIED TO CONTACT THE GOZ, HE SAID THERE </p><p>HAD BEEN NO OFFICIAL CONTACT AS OF YET.  CHIKOROWONDO </p><p>ADDED THAT HE DOES NOT THINK UGANDA AND RWANDA WERE </p><p>BEHIND THE KILLING, BUT NOTED THEY ARE "ENEMIES OF THE </p><p>CONGO," AND SAID HE WAS SURPRISED AT HOW QUICKLY KIGALI </p><p>HAD REPORTED THE SHOOTING OF KABILA (WITHIN AN HOUR OF </p><p>ITS OCCURRENCE).  NONETHELESS, HE HAS NOT HEARD OF THEIR </p><p>REBEL ALLIES PREPARING ANY OFFENSIVE ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00494  241418Z </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: CHIKOROWONDO BASICALLY STUCK TO THE GOZ </p><p>LINE ON THE DRC.  HOWEVER, HIS REPORT THAT THE HEADS OF </p><p>STATE PUT OFF A FORMAL MEETING WITH JOSEPH KABILA AT AN </p><p>OPPORTUNE TIME SUGGESTS THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD ON THE PEACE PROCESS UNTIL THEY HAVE A FIRMER </p><p>IDEA OF WHO IN THE DRC SUPPORTS HIM.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
