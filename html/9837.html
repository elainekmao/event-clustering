<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001462 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, SA/RA AND S/CT </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  THE MAOISTS\' JULY 31 STATEMENT AND POST </p><p>ASSESSMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1431 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The Maoists\' July 31 public release, accepting the </p><p>government\'s invitation to a third round of peace talks, is </p><p>provided at paragraph 2.  Post\'s assessment is available at </p><p>paragraph 3. </p><p> </p><p>July 31 Maoist Statement </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) </p><p>Central Committee </p><p> </p><p>Press Statement </p><p> </p><p>According to the vast nationalism of the Nepalese community </p><p>and the necessity and desire of the great Nepalese people, we </p><p>would like to involve ourselves with full responsibility in </p><p>the peace talks process with the old state power towards a </p><p>progressive political solution in order to resolve the civil </p><p>war.  But throughout the two rounds of formal peace talks </p><p>held during the six month long cease-fire, the old state </p><p>power has not demonstrated its seriousness towards the </p><p>progressive political solution, and it is observed that the </p><p>entire talks process and the developing desire of the people </p><p>has been misused through the collection of regressive </p><p>strength.  The possibility for the talks to succeed, the </p><p>steps taken by our party towards a progressive political </p><p>solution, and the country\'s hope and faith have become a joke </p><p>and a situation of confusion.  In the latest situation, our </p><p>party\'s talk team in its exchange of a series of letters has </p><p>kept its faith to the struggle.  It is well known to all that </p><p>during this exchange, our party has presented a minimum of </p><p>fundamental demands for a new round of talks and set 31 July </p><p>2003 as a deadline to fulfill our proposal.  The reply given </p><p>by the ruling state power, even though a conducive </p><p>environment has not been made, the principle commitments were </p><p>expressed; mainly the commitment to discus the political </p><p>subject matter, initiate the release of our three central </p><p>leaders, and publicize the situation of the missing is </p><p>positively accepted and respecting the desire and appeal of </p><p>civil society, intellectuals and various political parties, </p><p>our party has decided and given indication to our talk team </p><p>to sit for the third round of peace talks to move the </p><p>forward.  With our decision, we hope that the old state power </p><p>will give concrete practical commitment. </p><p> </p><p>We would like to give emphasis on the political subject </p><p>during this round of talks rather than technical subjects. </p><p>In this particular situation of the country and in order to </p><p>make the launch of the political solution easy, we believe </p><p>the participation of the representation of the agitating </p><p>political parties is compulsory.  For such representation, we </p><p>appeal to the political parties and also urge the ruling </p><p>power to make arrangements for this.  It is necessary to </p><p>seriously reason that the actual solution to the problem is </p><p>not possible without a progressive political solution. </p><p> </p><p>31 July 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Prachanda </p><p>Chairman </p><p>NCP (Maoist) </p><p>Central Committee </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>Post Assessment </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The fully translated statement, unavailable for </p><p>reftel, leaves much to be desired in terms of a Maoist </p><p>commitment to peace.  The invitation to the political parties </p><p>to participate in the negotiations represents a restructuring </p><p>of their political agenda.  The Maoists had deferred party </p><p>participation to a roundtable conference, which they </p><p>envisioned would include representatives from all sectors of </p><p>society, followed by a constituent assembly.  This sudden </p><p>diversion from their oft-repeated plan indicates a shift in </p><p>the Maoist assessment of the political situation.  If the </p><p>government agrees to include the political parties, who have </p><p>ignored the peace talks in favor of partisan bickering and </p><p>one-upmanship in hopes of being appointed to head an interim </p><p>government, this could risk introducing an unruly and </p><p>possibly uncertain element to the talks.  It is unlikely that </p><p>the parties will abandon their shortsighted behavior and act </p><p>for the good of the country; more likely, the parties\' </p><p>inclusion could engender new combinations of shifting </p><p>alliances at the negotiating table, adding confusion to the </p><p>talks.  In the final analysis, the Maoists\' acceptance of a </p><p>third round of peace talks has raised the hopes of the </p><p>Nepalese, while government contacts fear this will delay the </p><p>inevitable return to violence by only weeks or, at the most, </p><p>months. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
