<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 000495 </p><p> </p><p>USIA </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA, I/GNEA </p><p>STATE FOR SA/PAB, D, PA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  01/23/09 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, KISL, PK, AF </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC DIPLOMACY:  USAMA BIN LADIN </p><p> </p><p>REF: PESHAWAR 031 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY PUBLIC DIPLOMACY COUNSELOR </p><p>RICHARD HOAGLAND FOR REASONS 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  IT IS OUR IMPRESSION THAT </p><p>THE USG IS NOT DOING AS WELL AS IT MIGHT </p><p>PROJECTING PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ON USAMA BIN </p><p>LADIN (UBL).  WE WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON CONSIDER A REVIEW OF THIS PUBLIC </p><p>DIPLOMACY EFFORT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION TRENDS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  WE NOTE THE FOLLOWING PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>TRENDS: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE PRO-TALIBAN AL-RASHID TRUST IN </p><p>KARACHI CONTINUES TO CHURN OUT PRO-UBL -- AND </p><p>CORRESPONDINGLY ANTI-U.S./ANTI-WESTERN -- </p><p>BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, AND POSTERS IN </p><p>URDU, ENGLISH, AND AFGHAN LANGUAGES AT </p><p>NOMINAL COST OR FOR FREE DISTRIBUTION.  E.G., </p><p>THE TRUST RECENTLY INTRODUCED A 3\' X 2\' FOUR- </p><p>COLOR PRO-UBL POSTER WITH PHOTOS, MAPS, AND </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL TEXTS AVAILABLE FOR 15 RUPEES, </p><p>ABOUT 30 CENTS -- JUST A BIT MORE THAN THE </p><p>COST OF A SIDEWALK HAIRCUT.  THIS POSTER BEAT </p><p>THE USG\'S UBL "WANTED" POSTER TO THE STREET. </p><p> </p><p>--  WE FREQUENTLY HEAR REPORTS THAT SOME IN </p><p>THE LOWER-MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASSES, BOTH </p><p>URBAN AND RURAL, CONSIDER UBL AN ISLAMIC HERO </p><p>BECAUSE THE U.S. HAS NAMED HIM "PUBLIC ENEMY </p><p>NUMBER ONE."  THAT SAID, IT\'S OUR IMPRESSION </p><p>THAT THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS, AT LEAST IN </p><p>PAKISTAN, DO NOT NECESSARILY SUPPORT THIS </p><p>VIEW.  THE PENDING USG DISTRIBUTION OF UBL </p><p>"WANTED" POSTERS AND MATCHBOOKS IN PAKISTAN </p><p>MAY INCREASE UBL\'S STATURE AS A KIND OF FOLK </p><p>HERO. </p><p> </p><p>--  U.S. AND BRITISH EFFORTS TO DISTINGUISH </p><p>BETWEEN TERRORISTS, LIKE BIN LADIN, AND "GOOD </p><p>MUSLIMS" ARE SOMETIMES PORTRAYED IN THE MEDIA </p><p>AND BY RELIGIOUS FIGURES IN THEIR WRITINGS </p><p>AND SERMONS AS ATTEMPTS TO DIVIDE ALL MUSLIMS </p><p>BY CO-OPTING WESTERNIZED -- MEANING (TO THEM) </p><p>"MORALLY CORRUPT" -- MODERATES.  (NOTE:  THIS </p><p>REPRESENTS THE PHILOSOPHICALLY ROMANTIC VIEW </p><p>THAT ISLAM PER SE ERASES ALL DIVISIONS, THAT </p><p>THE MUSLIM UMMAH IS "ONE," AND THAT AN ATTACK </p><p>ON ONE IS AN ATTACK ON ALL.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>--    IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THEIR ORDINARY </p><p>EXECRABLE PUBLIC RELATIONS PERFORMANCE ON THE </p><p>BIN LADEN QUESTION, THE TALIBAN HAVE PRE- </p><p>EMPTED US CONSISTENTLY SINCE AUGUST, FIRST BY </p><p>ANNOUNCING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HAVE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN;S SUPREME COURT EXAMINE THE </p><p>CHARGES AGAINST BIN LADIN AND THEN BY </p><p>ANNOUNCING THAT NO "EVIDENCE" (BY WHICH THEY </p><p>MEANT HARD FACTS IN PROOF OF THE CHARGES) HAD </p><p>BEEN PRESENTED.  OUR RESPONSE IN EACH CASE </p><p>WAS MUTED AND DELAYED.  CONTINUING THIS TREND </p><p>ON THE TALIBAN\'S PART, EARLY IN JANUARY, THE </p><p>TALIBAN SPONSORED A SEMINAR IN KABUL, </p><p>REPORTED BY RADIO SHARIA, ON THE LIFE, TIMES, </p><p>AND THOUGHTS OF UBL (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  ACCORDING TO RECENT PRESS REPORTS, </p><p>PAKISTANI TALIBS WHO HAVE SERVED IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, ALONG WITH AFGHAN TALIBS, ARE </p><p>BEGINNING TO ENFORCE THEIR DOGMAS AND SOCIAL </p><p>CONTROLS IN PAKISTAN\'S TRIBAL TERRITORIES AND </p><p>IN SOME PLACES IN BALOCHISTAN AND NWFP </p><p>PROVINCES.  ALSO, LAST WEEK, THE GOP ENFORCED </p><p>ISLAMIC LAW BY DECREE IN MALAKAND DIVISION </p><p>AND IN A PART OF KOHISTAN.  ALTHOUGH THESE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ISOLATED AS YET, </p><p>THEY SUGGEST A DISTURBING TREND.  INDEED, THE </p><p>FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE PAKISTANI </p><p>CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHING SHARIA AS THE </p><p>SUPREME LAW OF PAKISTAN -- AN AVOWEDLY HIGH </p><p>PRIORITY OF THE NAWAZ SHARIF GOVERNMENT -- </p><p>HAS BEEN PASSED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND </p><p>IS PENDING BEFORE THE SENATE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WE ARE UNLIKELY EVER TO MAKE MUCH </p><p>INROAD WITH UBL\'S HARD-CORE SUPPORTERS </p><p>BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUE-BELIEVER ABSOLUTISTS </p><p>AND TEND TO THINK AND REACT LARGELY </p><p>EMOTIONALLY:  FACTS ARE LESS IMPORTANT TO </p><p>THEM THAN EMOTIONS.  THEY ARE NOT OPEN TO </p><p>PERSUASION.  FURTHER, WE FACE A FORMIDABLE </p><p>FOE AMONG THOSE WHO ARE CHURNING OUT AND </p><p>WIDELY DISSEMINATING PRO-UBL PROPAGANDA AND </p><p>TAKING OTHER ACTIVE MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A </p><p>LARGE MIDDLE GROUND, IN PAKISTAN AND IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, WHICH IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY ANTI- </p><p>U.S./ANTI-WESTERN AND WHICH IS NOT </p><p>IDEOLOGICALLY COMMITTED TO UBL AND HIS PAN- </p><p>ISLAMIST REVOLUTION.  THIS MIDDLE GROUND, </p><p>SOMEWHAT SUSCEPTIBLE TO REASON, OR AT LEAST </p><p>TO OTHER INFORMATION, SHOULD BE OUR PRIMARY </p><p>TARGET.  THE MESSAGE CRAFTED FOR THEM WOULD </p><p>ALSO BE WELCOMED BY THE EDUCATED, WESTWARD- </p><p>LOOKING ELITE OF BOTH PAKISTAN AND </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WHO FEEL THREATENED BY UBL\'S </p><p>ADVOCACY OF VIOLENCE AND THEOLOGICAL </p><p>OBSCURANTISM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE FOCUS OF ANY ENHANCED USG PUBLIC </p><p>DIPLOMACY EFFORT SHOULD BE TO PORTRAY UBL AND </p><p>OTHERS AROUND HIM AS CRIMINALS, BOTH BY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND BY ISLAMIC STANDARDS. </p><p>WHERE POSSIBLE, RESPONSIBILITY OF THE </p><p>MOVEMENT "AL-QAIDA" SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED, NOT </p><p>JUST UBL AS AN INDIVIDUAL. </p><p> </p><p>--  WHEN WE FOCUS ON BIN LADIN, AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY FOR AFGHAN CONSUMPTION, WE SHOULD </p><p>MAKE THREE POINTS:  1) THE U.S. IS NOT </p><p>AGAINST AFGHANISTAN AND THE AFGHAN PEOPLE, 2) </p><p>THE U.S. IS NOT AGAINST ANY PARTICULAR AFGHAN </p><p>POLITICAL FACTION, AND 3) THE U.S. WANTS UBL </p><p>EXPELLED FROM AFGHANISTAN TO A PLACE WHERE HE </p><p>CAN BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE BROADER PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT COULD </p><p>INCLUDE, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, A "CHARGE </p><p>SHEET" OF THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY UBL, BY HIS </p><p>CLOSEST ASSOCIATES, AND BY HIS FOLLOWERS, </p><p>NOTING THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEIR VICTIMS </p><p>HAVE BEEN MUSLIMS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES. </p><p> </p><p>--  RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO PROTECT SOURCES </p><p>AND METHODS AND NOT TO COMPROMISE ON-GOING </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS AND JUDICIAL PROCESSES, WE </p><p>SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT </p><p>POSSIBLE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE NAIROBI AND </p><p>DAR ES SALAAM BOMBINGS, AS WELL AS ABOUT </p><p>UBL\'S AND HIS MOVEMENT\'S OTHER CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>--  THIS INTENSIFIED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT </p><p>SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE VALIDATION FROM ISLAMIC </p><p>SOURCES THAT THESE CRIMES ARE INDEED </p><p>RECOGNIZED AS CRIMES UNDER ISLAM.  RATHER </p><p>THAN STATEMENTS BY U.S.- OR UK-BASED ISLAMIC </p><p>SCHOLARS, IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO USE </p><p>THE TEACHINGS AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF MAJOR </p><p>ISLAMIC SCHOLARS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS FROM </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, AND ELSEWHERE.  IN </p><p>SELECTING/ELICITING SUCH CITATIONS, IT SHOULD </p><p>BE KEPT IN MIND THAT UBL AND THE PAN- </p><p>ISLAMISTS DISMISS SAUDI ARABIA AND EGYPT AS </p><p>ONLY NOMINALLY ISLAMIC STATES CAPTIVE TO </p><p>U.S.-TOADYING, DESPOTIC, AND APOSTATE LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>--  KEEPING IN MIND THAT IN HIS DECEMBER 23 </p><p>INTERVIEW UBL JUSTIFIED KILLING MUSLIMS IN </p><p>HIS JIHAD AGAINST "CRUSADERS AND JEWS," AND </p><p>RECOGNIZING THE EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF OUR </p><p>TARGET AUDIENCE, WE SHOULD PREPARE FOR </p><p>DISSEMINATION MORE HUMAN INTEREST STORIES OF </p><p>UBL\'S VICTIMS, ESPECIALLY HIS MUSLIM VICTIMS </p><p>OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES.  U.S. MEDIA REPORTS </p><p>OF BLINDED KENYANS, FOR EXAMPLE, RECEIVED </p><p>GOOD COVERAGE IN THE PAKISTANI PRINT MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (7)  EFFECTIVE METHODS WOULD NATURALLY </p><p>INCLUDE THE TRADITIONAL USG PUBLIC DIPLOMACY </p><p>TOOLS:  VOA LANGUAGE SERVICES, INCLUDING </p><p>INTERVIEWS WITH UBL\'S MUSLIM VICTIMS; </p><p>CAREFULLY TARGETED WORLDNET INTERACTIVES; </p><p>WIRELESS-FILE TEXTS AND FACT SHEETS FOR </p><p>TRANSLATION INTO LOCAL LANGUAGES; AND </p><p>COMMISSIONED ARTICLES FOR PRESS PLACEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CONSIDERATION COULD ALSO BE GIVEN TO </p><p>PRODUCTION OF A BOOKLET IN LOCAL LANGUAGES ON </p><p>THE CRIMES OF BIN LADIN AND HIS ASSOCIATES, </p><p>ALONG WITH VICTIMS\' STORIES, FOR NON- </p><p>CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION IN MOSQUES, </p><p>MADRASSAS, ISLAMIC STUDY CENTERS, ISLAMIA </p><p>DEPARTMENTS OF UNIVERSITIES, AND BOOKSTORES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) A NON-USG-IDENTIFIED WEB SITE COULD </p><p>ALSO BE CREATED TO POST THE ABOVE MATERIAL </p><p>AND THE URL WIDELY DISTRIBUTED.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE COUNTER-INTUITIVE -- </p><p>THAT THE MASSES DON\'T USE THE INTERNET -- </p><p>ALMOST ALL ISLAMIC AND ISLAMIST GROUPS DO </p><p>INDEED HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AND USE IT </p><p>EXTENSIVELY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOAGLAND </p><p></p></div>
