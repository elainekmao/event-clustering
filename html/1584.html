IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: ON MARCH 8 AND 9, ACTING PRINCIPAL </p><p>DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY MARK BELLAMY MET WITH </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY NICHOLAS GOCHE, </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\' PERMANENT SECRETARY </p><p>WILLARD CHIWEWE, AND HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN NKOMO. </p><p>BELLAMY REITERATED U.S. CONCERN FOR THE BREAKDOWN IN THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW AND AMERICAN UNWILLINGNESS TO LOOK THE OTHER </p><p>WAY WHEN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE AT </p><p>STAKE.  ALL THREE SEEMED TO RESPOND FROM THE SAME </p><p>SCRIPT.  THE MEETINGS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY A GOVERNMENT </p><p>VILIFICATION OF THE UK FOR ZIMBABWE\'S PROBLEMS, A </p><p>LABELING OF THE MDC AS AN ILLEGITIMATE PARTY BANKROLLED </p><p>BY FOREIGN INTERESTS, AN EXPLANATION OF THE "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>LAND PROGRAM AS THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF THE </p><p>LIBERATION STRUGGLE, AND AN UNAPOLOGETIC ATTITUDE ABOUT </p><p>THE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY WAR VETERANS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. CONCERN GROWING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN ALL THREE OF HIS MEETINGS WITH GOZ OFFICIALS, </p><p>ACTING PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY BELLAMY </p><p>STATED THAT THE NEW U.S. ADMINISTRATION WILL BE LOOKING </p><p>MORE CLOSELY AT ZIMBABWE.  THERE IS GROWING CONCERN IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01023  01 OF 03  150818Z </p><p>WASHINGTON OVER THE WORSENING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>CRISES IN ZIMBABWE, BELLAMY POINTED OUT, AND THAT THE </p><p>USG IS CONSIDERING WHAT SHOULD BE ITS ROLE IN OVERCOMING </p><p>THESE CRISES.  THE EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE ENTIRE REGION, AS </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTORS STEER CLEAR OF SOUTHERN AFRICA.  THE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION, WITH ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY, </p><p>MEDIA, AND OPPOSITION, ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN, THE </p><p>ACTING PDAS SAID.  HE FURTHER STRESSED THAT THE U.S. </p><p>DOES NOT SEEK AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ZIMBABWE, </p><p>BUT IT CANNOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ARE ABUSED AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH IMPUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK IS TO BLAME FOR OUR PROBLEMS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) EVERY MINISTER WITH WHOM BELLAMY MET RESPONDED </p><p>BY VILIFYING THE UK IN THE MOST STRIDENT LANGUAGE AND </p><p>PLACED THE BLAME FOR ZIMBABWE\'S TROUBLES AT THEIR FEET. </p><p>IN A LONG, RAMBLING DISCOURSE, GOCHE BLAMED THE BRITISH </p><p>FOR THWARTING ZIMBABWE\'S ATTEMPTS AT LAND REFORM SINCE </p><p>DAY ONE.  HE CITED THE 1997 LETTER BY MINISTER CLARE </p><p>SHORT TO THE ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE THAT </p><p>STATED THE LABOR GOVERNMENT WAS NOT INTERESTED IN </p><p>COLONIAL MATTERS AND WOULD NOT HONOR OBLIGATIONS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT.  GOCHE REPORTED </p><p>THAT MUGABE, UPON HEARING THE LETTER READ ALOUD, SAID, </p><p>"IF THEY WON\'T HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE WON\'T </p><p>EITHER."  THE SECURITY MINISTER PROFESSED THE BELIEF </p><p>THAT THE BRITISH DID NOT WANT ZANU-PF TO DELIVER LAND TO </p><p>ITS SUPPORTERS IN THE RURAL AREAS, AND THAT IT WANTED TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01023  01 OF 03  150818Z </p><p>CAPITALIZE ON DISAFFECTION IN THE URBAN AREAS IN ORDER </p><p>TO OUST MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MINISTER NKOMO SAID THE GOZ FELT "BETRAYED" BY </p><p>THE UK, AND THAT IT IS "PREPARED TO FIGHT" THEM.  THE </p><p>BRITISH ARE ESSENTIALLY MAKING A RACIAL ISSUE OUT OF </p><p>THEIR CONDEMNATION OF ZIMBABWE, AND SIMPLY WANT TO </p><p>PROTECT THEIR "KITH AND KIN," I.E. WHITE ZIMBABWEANS, HE </p><p>ARGUED.  NKOMO COMPLAINED THAT THE BRITISH WOULD NOT </p><p>ALLOW THE GOZ TO USE LAND ROVERS THEY HAD SOLD TO THEM </p><p>TO EXPEL WAR VETERANS FROM OCCUPIED FARMS.  NKOMO AND </p><p>MFA PERMSEC CHIWEWE CASTIGATED THE UK (AND THE U.S. AS </p><p>WELL) FOR FAILING TO DELIVER ON PROMISES TO FUND LAND </p><p>REFORM IN ZIMBABWE.  CHIWEWE ITERATED THE GOZ\'S GREAT </p><p>CONCERN THAT THE U.S. IS FALLING UNDER THE SWAY OF THE </p><p>UK\'S POLICY ON ZIMBABWE, AND URGED THE U.S. TO PROVIDE </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN HELPING ZIMBABWE.  BELLAMY RESPONDED THAT </p><p>THE U.S. WILL MAKE ITS OWN DECISIONS ON ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>WILL NOT BE "SWAYED" BY OTHER NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>MDC A STOOGE OF FOREIGN INTERESTS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ALL THREE INTERLOCUTORS CHARACTERIZED THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MDC AS A CREATION OF FOREIGN INTERESTS FUNDED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO5985 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01023  02 OF 03  150818Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------D1F66F  150818Z /38 </p><p>O 150815Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8430 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 001023 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/15/11 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI, SA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01023  02 OF 03  150818Z </p><p>SUBJECT: AF A/PDAS BELLAMY HEARS DEFIANCE, VILIFICATION </p><p>OF THE BRITISH AND LITTLE GIVE-AND-TAKE IN MEETINGS WITH </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH FOREIGN MONEY.  CHIWEWE STATED THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS HAVE STRUGGLED TO UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS WITH </p><p>THOSE THAT ONCE POINTED GUNS AT THEM, BUT WHEN THEY </p><p>START GETTING MONEY FROM OUTSIDE TO THREATEN ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, IT BECOMES A DIFFERENT STORY.  HE </p><p>FLATLY ACCUSED THE U.S. AND UK OF "FANNING" THE MDC SO </p><p>THAT IT COULD OUST PRESIDENT MUGABE.  HE SAID THE U.S. </p><p>NOT ONLY WANTS TO SEE ZANU-PF OUT OF POWER, IT WANTS TO </p><p>SEE THE MDC IN STATE HOUSE.  BELLAMY ASSURED THE PERMSEC </p><p>THAT THE U.S. HAS NO INTEREST IN WHICH PARTY GOVERNS </p><p>ZIMBABWE, ONLY IN HOW IT ATTAINS POWER.  NKOMO STATED </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE WAS "UNDER SIEGE" AND HAD TO PROTECT ITS </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY FROM THE FOREIGN-FUNDED LACKEYS OF THE MDC. </p><p>GOCHE CLAIMED THAT THE BRITISH HAD CHANNELED A LARGE </p><p>AMOUNT OF MONEY THROUGH THEIR HIGH COMMISSION IN MALAWI </p><p>TO FUND THE START-UP OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CHIWEWE STATED THAT THE LAND ISSUE IS THE </p><p>"UNFINISHED BUSINESS" OF THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE, THAT </p><p>THE MASSES ARE STILL LIVING AS THEY WERE IN 1980, OR </p><p>EVEN IN 1890, WHEN THE BRITISH FIRST ARRIVED.  IF THE </p><p>DONORS ARE NOT GOING TO HELP US WITH LAND, CHIWEWE </p><p>BLUSTERED, THEN "LET US BE THE POOREST COUNTRY IN THE </p><p>WORLD IF IT MEANS ZIMBABWEANS HAVE THEIR OWN LAND.  IF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01023  02 OF 03  150818Z </p><p>WE FAIL (TO GIVE THEM LAND), THEN LET THE PEOPLE TURN US </p><p>OUT."  NKOMO BLAMED IMF AND WORLD BANK FOR CAUSING THE </p><p>FAILURE OF THE 1998 DONORS CONFERENCE AGREEMENT, AND THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) FOR STALLING PROGRESS </p><p>SINCE THEN.  NKOMO SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH HIS </p><p>FRIENDS IN THE CFU, THAT THEY HAD BETRAYED HIS TRUST. </p><p>MANY IN THE CFU ARE NOT "SERIOUS-MINDED" AND ONLY MAKE </p><p>OFFERS FOR A SETTLEMENT AS A DELAYING TACTIC, NKOMO </p><p>OPINED.  GOCHE ADMITTED THAT THE GOZ HAD MADE MISTAKES </p><p>IN THE LAND RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE, BUT IF IT FINDS A </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE ISSUE, ITS PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>NO PROBLEM WITH THE WAR VETS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE GOZ OFFICIALS GENERALLY TOOK AN UNAPOLOGETIC </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WAR VETERANS\' RAMPAGE ACROSS THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  CHIWEWE ARGUED THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE AND THE FARM OCCUPATIONS BY WAR </p><p>VETERANS ARE SEPARATE ISSUES.  THE POLICE AND ARMY </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE ASKED TO FIGHT THEIR FELLOW LIBERATION </p><p>FIGHTERS, THE PERMSEC CONTENDED.  THE HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER IMPLIED THAT THE WAR VETERANS ARE "WORKING TO </p><p>MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT SECURE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION."  IN THE PAST, AFTER THE POLICE REMOVED WAR </p><p>VETS FROM OCCUPIED FARMS, THEY WOULD SIMPLY RETURN A FEW </p><p>DAYS LATER, NKOMO REMARKED.  "WE ARE NOW IN CONTROL OF </p><p>THE WAR VETS," HE CLAIMED.  A LOT OF CRIMINALS ARE </p><p>RUNNING AROUND CLAIMING TO BE WAR VETERANS, BUT THE GOZ </p><p>IS CRACKING DOWN ON THEM WITH A NEW CONSTABULARY FORCE </p><p>THAT WILL HAVE ENOUGH PERSONNEL TO FIGHT THE CRIMINALS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01023  02 OF 03  150818Z </p><p>THE MINISTER ASSERTED.  HIS MINISTRY HAS COMPILED A LIST </p><p>OF 740 CASES OF VIOLENT ACTS TO BE PROSECUTED, ONE OF </p><p>WHICH HAS ALREADY SEEN THE CONVICTION OF A COP-KILLER, </p><p>NKOMO REPORTED.  GOCHE REPORTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THE WAR VETS HAD REACHED AN UNDERSTANDING ON MARCH 7 </p><p>THAT WOULD SOON SEE THE OCCUPIERS MOVE OFF UNLISTED </p><p>FARMS GAZETTED FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) BELLAMY\'S MEETINGS WITH GOCHE, CHIWEWE, AND </p><p>NKOMO LEFT THE IMPRESSION OF A WELL-COORDINATED </p><p>PROPAGANDA ASSAULT ORCHESTRATED FROM ON HIGH.  THE </p><p>THEMES CONVEYED BY ALL THREE WERE REMARKABLY SIMILAR, </p><p>AND THE LANGUAGE USED WAS SOME OF THE MOST STRIDENT WE </p><p>HAVE HEARD TO DATE.  THE OFFICIALS\' COMMENTS AND TONE </p><p>STRUCK A NOTE OF DESPERATION IN THEIR EFFORT TO CONVINCE </p><p>THE U.S. OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>POSITION.  THERE WAS VERY LITTLE GIVE-AND-TAKE, AND THEY </p><p>CONCEDED VERY FEW POINTS.  IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT THAT </p><p>NONE OF THE OFFICIALS SEEMED VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>STATE OF THE ECONOMY OR WHAT THE OUTSIDE WORLD MIGHT DO </p><p>TO HELP WITH IT.  THE ECONOMY JUST DOES NOT SEEM TO BE </p><p>PART OF THEIR POLITICAL CALCULUS.
