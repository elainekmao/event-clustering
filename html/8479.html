<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001136 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WIN DAYTON </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC IN RETREAT - MASS ACTION DAY THREE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 1122 </p><p> </p><p>     B. HARARE 1101 </p><p>     C. HARARE 1097 </p><p>     D. HARARE 1081 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Youth militia members in military garb beat MDC </p><p>activists, mostly in Harare\'s high-density suburbs on the </p><p>night of June 3 - 4.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p>delivered a prepared statement to the diplomatic community </p><p>condemning the international community for its double </p><p>standard toward the GOZ and the MDC.  This week\'s events have </p><p>left the MDC in disarray and panic, and will likely cause </p><p>them to re-think their strategy in the coming weeks.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Activists Beaten </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to MDC Presidential Advisor, Gandi </p><p>Mudzingwa, what appeared to be youth militia members in </p><p>military vehicles, with military garb and some carrying AK-47 </p><p>assault rifles beat numerous MDC activists in high-density </p><p>areas around Harare, and at the University of Zimbabwe on the </p><p>night of June 3 - 4.  Mudzingwa reported that 21 people had </p><p>sought medical help from the MDC\'s social welfare office.  On </p><p>June 4, Poloff visited the casualty ward of the Avenues </p><p>Clinic in central Harare and saw 30 or so persons in the </p><p>waiting room with casts on their arms, bloodied bandages on </p><p>their hands, and various visible cuts and bruises.  According </p><p>to the Matron on duty, Elizabeth Sibotshiwe, Avenues had </p><p>about 15 more cases than usual of soft tissue injuries (what </p><p>equates to a 50 percent increase)--an increase similar to the </p><p>last MDC led stayaway.  The injuries were consistent with </p><p>baton blows; most were minor, only one so far would </p><p>necessitate an overnight stay. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) (Comment: If 15 extra people from the high density </p><p>areas made it all the way to the center of town to the </p><p>Avenues clinic, and 21 made it to the MDC offices - with </p><p>petrol and transportation shortages as they are, and assuming </p><p>many may not be seeking medical attention - we would guess </p><p>the total number of those beaten in the Harare area to be </p><p>much higher.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>One Dead </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to the MDC Information Department and </p><p>Mudzingwa police abducted Sydney Mazaranhanga, an MDC </p><p>councilor from Mbare, and Tichaona Kaguru, an MDC activist, </p><p>from Mazaranhanga\'s home on the night of June 3.  Police beat </p><p>the two severely, and released them in Mabvuku.  Kaguru died </p><p>of injuries sustained on June 4.  Although the MDC </p><p>Information Department also reported that 2 people were </p><p>killed in Highfield on Monday, and 3 students were killed at </p><p>UZ on the night of June 3 - there has been no independent </p><p>confirmation of those deaths. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Mudzingwa said the MDC had no concrete plans to </p><p>attempt more marches this week.  He said some hoped for a </p><p>march in Harare on June 6, but with activists beaten they </p><p>were in panic and disarray and would be unlikely to pull it </p><p>off. </p><p> </p><p>MFA Criticizes West </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The Minister of Foreign Affairs delivered a prepared </p><p>statement at a briefing for chiefs of diplomatic missions on </p><p>June 4 condemning the international community for supporting </p><p>the MDC\'s illegal mass action.  The statement criticized the </p><p>international community\'s double standard of condemning the </p><p>GOZ for subverting the rule of law, while it turned a blind </p><p>eye as the MDC subverted a high court order by staging a mass </p><p>action which resulted in the death of a ZANU-PF supporter in </p><p>Mbare.  The statement was critical of the June 3 G8 </p><p>statement, but applauded the recent Mbeki, Obasanjo, Muluzi </p><p>"African" initiative to find solutions to Zimbabwe\'s problems. </p><p> </p><p>Stayaway Losing Ground </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Driving around Harare on June 4, Poloffs observed that </p><p>only about 50 percent of shops in downtown Harare, and 90 </p><p>percent of businesses in the light industrial areas of Harare </p><p>were closed.  Pedestrian and vehicle traffic in downtown </p><p>Harare seemed almost normal.  Activity in the high-density </p><p>suburb of Mbare seemed normal. </p><p>8. (SBU) One or two groups of 3 police officers were visible </p><p>in downtown Harare on June 4; they assumed very relaxed </p><p>postures. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) According to Sheba Dube, head of the Bulawayo chapter </p><p>of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) about 50 percent of </p><p>businesses in downtown Bulawayo were closed on June 4, and </p><p>there was light vehicle and pedestrian traffic in Bulawayo. </p><p>According to Richard Pope, a furniture manufacturer in </p><p>Bulawayo, about 25 percent of his workers did not show up on </p><p>June 4.  His factory was open, but running at reduced </p><p>capacity.  He said many other factories nearby were </p><p>theoretically "open", i.e. they would tell inquiring police </p><p>they were open; however, due to worker shortages they were </p><p>not actually operating. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Due to the difficulties the MDC was experiencing in </p><p>maintaining the stayaway, Mudzingwa said the MDC may call the </p><p>stayaway a victory in tomorrow\'s press and allow businesses </p><p>to reopen. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Through a predictable campaign of violence on the </p><p>night of June 3 - 4, the GOZ had the MDC in even faster </p><p>retreat on June 4 with the possibility of street </p><p>demonstrations all but eliminated, and the stayaway barely </p><p>holding.  Mudzingwa\'s admission that their structures are in </p><p>disarray and panic suggests the MDC may have to re-think </p><p>their strategies carefully as the GOZ appears to be coming </p><p>out ahead after this week\'s events.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
