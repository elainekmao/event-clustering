STATE 162318 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2421 </p><p>     C. ABUJA NI2443 </p><p>     D. IIR 7 800 0307 01 </p><p>     E. IIR 7 800 0297 01 </p><p>     F. ABUJA 2331 </p><p>     G. ABUJA 2477 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.5 (d/g) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============ </p><p>INTRODUCTION </p><p>============ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Embassy received Ref A request for pre-deployment </p><p>assessment on 26 September.  By this date, deployments for </p><p>Operation Focus Relief trainers were already well underway, </p><p>and training had already begun at Birnin-Kebbi (training in </p><p>Ilorin and Serti is scheduled to begin on 8 October). </p><p>Additionally, Mission has provided Department with a general </p><p>security and stability assessment for Nigeria (Ref B) and </p><p>Mission-wide tripwires (Ref G).  However, Embassy gladly </p><p>provides the following analysis specific to the security of </p><p>OFR personnel, in the event of a negative public reaction to </p><p>U.S. action against terrorists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================== </p><p>GENERAL ASSESSMENT </p><p>================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The likelihood of ethnic or religious unrest in </p><p>Nigeria in the wake of an eventual U.S. response to the </p><p>September 11 acts of terror is high.  Such unrest would not </p><p>necessarily be targeted at American individuals or </p><p>institutions, but American lives and property could be at </p><p>risk.  Tensions here remain elevated following recent events </p><p>in Jos and Wukari.  Demonstrations -- either in favor of or </p><p>opposing U.S. military actions -- could spark renewed </p><p>ethno-religious fighting, especially in the Middle Belt, but </p><p>potentially almost anywhere.  Major Muslim religious leaders </p><p>here have unequivocally condemned the attacks on the U.S. </p><p>However, many Muslims will be angered over any U.S. reprisal </p><p>attack that affects fellow Muslims, especially if there are </p><p>significant civilian casualties.  Some Muslims can be </p><p>expected to stage protests, as they did during the Gulf War </p><p>and following our reprisals for the Embassy bombings in 1998. </p><p> The GON is willing to protect U.S. diplomats and </p><p>installations in Abuja and Lagos, but its ability to do so is </p><p>not unlimited.  Outside of Abuja and the Lagos Islands, the </p><p>GON\'s means of controlling civil unrest are even less robust. </p><p> Recently, the GON has managed to quell serious unrest in Jos </p><p>only with the assistance of the military, and then after a </p><p>substantial loss of life. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Nigerian military is not seen as an effective </p><p>institution.  Due to a long history of harsh military rule, </p><p>the military is viewed by most of the population with </p><p>suspicion.  However, when civil unrest occurs in Nigeria, </p><p>at-risk populations regularly flee to military bases to seek </p><p>protection from this ethnically and religiously mixed (and </p><p>armed) institution.  The military has historically welcomed </p><p>onto its bases and protected these fleeing populations. </p><p>While rioters may overrun police stations, they steer clear </p><p>of major military installations.  Therefore, unrest is not </p><p>likely to threaten military bases, but bases could be faced </p><p>with streams of displaced persons seeking protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Based on planning for force protection, all OFR </p><p>personnel, with the exception of 3rd Group LNOs who work out </p><p>of the Embassy and live in an Abuja hotel, live on or next to </p><p>Nigerian military installations.  As noted above, general </p><p>unrest in Nigeria is unlikely to move against military </p><p>installations in a threatening manner.  Therefore, unrest, </p><p>whether caused by ethnic tensions or a reaction to a U.S. </p><p>response against terrorists, OFR personnel are most secure on </p><p>the Nigerian military bases where they live and work.  DATT, </p><p>as COR for OFR P3, recently garnered additional resources </p><p>from the Department of State for force protection at the </p><p>bases, and has instructed PA&E to begin the installation of </p><p>additional force protection measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Nigerian military began to take immediate steps to </p><p>provide additional force protection to OFR sites after the </p><p>event of September 11, in some cases adding additional </p><p>security without requests being made.  The military is also </p><p>working to provide other types of additional force protection </p><p>support to 3rd Group personnel (Ref D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================ </p><p>LOCATION SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FOB ABUJA: FOB Abuja is located at a Nigerian Air </p><p>Force installation within walking distance of Nnamdi Azikiwe </p><p>International Airport.  There are no large population centers </p><p>near the base, and while the OFR base can be seen from the </p><p>airport road, visibility is largely obscured by a long row of </p><p>trees, a cement wall and other protection measures such as </p><p>containers.  Because of the high amount of traffic in and out </p><p>of the FOB (due to its nature as a command center) and its </p><p>location near the airport, the FOB does have a higher profile </p><p>than the other bases.  However, the Nigerian military has </p><p>augmented its protection detail at the base. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) BIRNIN-KEBBI: PolMilOff and DATT have had several </p><p>conversations with Kebbi Governor Mohammed Aleiro regarding </p><p>OFR and Mission concerns for the well-being of OFR personnel </p><p>in Kebbi State (Refs E and F).  His assurances have been </p><p>significant.  Kebbi State is sparsely populated, and has not </p><p>in the past been the site of any demonstrations of note.  The </p><p>U.S. temporary base camp is located on the Nigerian military </p><p>base and is remote from the town of Birnin-Kebbi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ILORIN: Ilorin is politically restive, but this is an </p><p>ethnically-driven issue.  The U.S. camp is toward the rear of </p><p>a Nigerian Army Base that is not close to the town. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) SERTI: The base in Serti is extremely isolated and not </p><p>located near any population centers of note.  While Taraba </p><p>State has suffered bouts of ethnic conflict, Serti itself has </p><p>been tranquil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) SAFEHAVEN: In the unlikely event of forced evacuation </p><p>from a U.S. temporary base, OFR personnel would move to Abuja </p><p>to the FOB.  Depending on the situation, the personnel would </p><p>be moved by MI-8 helicopter (there is one MI-8 helicopter </p><p>stationed at each base) and/or road convoy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) This message was cleared with 3rd Group Battalion </p><p>Commander LTC Sherwood. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
