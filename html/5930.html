<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000232 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PGOV, PHUM, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL ANTI-WAR PROTESTS: WHAT KEEPS THEM SMALL? </p><p> </p><p>REF: ISTANBUL 225 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CG David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  In a country that recent polls show is </p><p>approximately 94 percent against a war in Iraq, one would </p><p>expect its largest city to have seen its share of large </p><p>anti-war demonstrations.  Despite a populace that holds views </p><p>more squarely anti-war than London, Paris or New York, to </p><p>date protest organizers have not been able to attract more </p><p>than 5,000-8,000 of Istanbul\'s 12 million residents.  The </p><p>reasons for this lie in Turkey\'s fragmented civil society; </p><p>police and security attitudes; and harsh winter weather.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>WHOSE RALLY IS IT? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The average Istanbul resident is strongly anti-war. </p><p>But, before attending a rally against the war, most likely he </p><p>or she will ask who is organizing it, and who is likely to </p><p>attend.  The possibility of a rally being &hijacked8 by, or </p><p>accused of collaboration with, more radical groups is a </p><p>powerful disincentive to participation.  In a February 15 </p><p>protest in Kadikoy, an initially peaceful protest became a </p><p>small-scale riot, involving Molotov cocktail throwing and the </p><p>arrest of approximately 60 alleged members of the </p><p>outlawed Kurdish PKK/KADEK organization.  Turkish citizens\' </p><p>desire to avoid trouble and distance themselves from </p><p>accusations of sympathy with some radical groups provide a </p><p>strong reason to stay home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Across the spectrum, political parties and NGOs have </p><p>held anti-war functions, but often seek to use the theme to </p><p>further their own ends.  If someone isn\'t a die-hard Saadet </p><p>Partisi supporter, for example, he probably doesn\'t want to </p><p>attend their rally, regardless of how he feels about the </p><p>anti-war theme.  Perhaps recognizing how difficult it has </p><p>been to bring out the crowds, the organizers of a February 22 </p><p>anti-war meeting billed their gathering as an academic </p><p>conference rather than a rally.  Poloff noted that </p><p>the rally-style speeches and rhetoric fell somewhat flat on a </p><p>sedate audience of approximately 150 journalists, academics, </p><p>and students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE HEAVY HAND OF LAW </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) More senior police commanders remember well the nearly </p><p>all-engulfing riots that paralyzed Istanbul in the late </p><p>1970s.  As a result, police are rarely out-manned at </p><p>political rallies.  In the case of openly announced </p><p>demonstrations, the police often arrive several hours in </p><p>advance, parking buses full of police throughout the area. </p><p>When a rally\'s organizers do not notify the police </p><p>(tantamount to requesting permission), reaction from the </p><p>authorities can be more severe.  In recent protests near </p><p>Galatasaray Lisesi (about a half mile from the Consulate </p><p>General) on February 19, police buses were backed up for </p><p>several blocks.  Two weeks prior, a protest planned for the </p><p>Abide-i Hurriyet Park in Sisli had hundreds of police filling </p><p>the location more than 3 hours in advance, with fewer </p><p>protesters than police showing up, partially due to rain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Our contacts also note that, at a typical rally, many </p><p>plain-clothes policemen permeate the crowd, and also </p><p>videotape the event.  The fact that taped speeches by </p><p>pro-Islamist politicians have been leaked by the security </p><p>establishment to the press in the past, often to discredit </p><p>the politicians\' claims of moderation, seems to support this </p><p>thesis.  When coupled with a general lack of civic activism </p><p>in Turkish society, efforts to avoid conflict with the police </p><p>(and possible subsequent detention) provide a second powerful </p><p>reason not to take to the streets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) One final factor reducing the size of possible </p><p>protests is the fact that Turkey\'s AK Parti government has </p><p>echoed the public\'s general anti-war sentiment in its </p><p>statements and policies.  If parliament (as is expected) </p><p>passes a resolution later this week allowing U.S. troops to </p><p>transit Turkish territory, anti-war activists may take to the </p><p>streets to protest their government\'s &disconnect8 with the </p><p>public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>RAIN AND SNOW </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Another important consideration is that the weather </p><p>has been almost unceasingly bad for the last three weeks. </p><p>Considerable rain and snow have kept Turks at home across the </p><p>board, with enclosed shopping malls the only significant </p><p>crowded locations.  Protests are unlikely to draw any large </p><p>numbers, no matter how heated the opposition, until the </p><p>weather improves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  With a government echoing many of the public\'s </p><p>anti-war arguments, even as it negotiates with the U.S. over </p><p>troop transit, rally participation may have seemed </p><p>unnecessary.  With the submission of a request to parliament </p><p>for authorization of U.S. troop transit, that dynamic could </p><p>change.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
