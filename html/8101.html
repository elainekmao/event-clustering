<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0136 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA AND PRM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  KURDS IN SOUTHEAST OPTIMISTIC; HOPE </p><p>FOR PKK KADEK AMNESTY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified; </p><p>please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: Recent meetings with our </p><p>regular Kurdish contacts reveal SE Turkey Kurds </p><p>are optimistic about the resolution of the </p><p>"Kurdish question" and are pinning their hopes </p><p>on the international community, most notably </p><p>the United States.  They also believe an </p><p>amnesty for PKK/KADEK members is critical to </p><p>achieving peace within the country.  Local </p><p>Turkish officials, nevertheless, maintain that </p><p>while not opposed to amnesty in principal, such </p><p>an amnesty will only antagonize the problem </p><p>further.  In any event, Ankara seems willing </p><p>only to consider a broadened repentance law, </p><p>without attendant economic and social </p><p>incentives.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Hope for a solution? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Following the Coalition victory in Iraq, </p><p>Southeastern Kurds are cautiously optimistic </p><p>that a solution to Kurdish issues will be </p><p>found.  While it will take time to fully </p><p>resolve the situation, the war in Iraq and the </p><p>United States\' "improved attitude" towards the </p><p>Kurdish people signal a beginning to stronger </p><p>international involvement in their plight.  Our </p><p>contacts vehemently state that only pressure by </p><p>the USG on the GOT to solve this issue and </p><p>inclusion of Kurds in the new Iraqi government </p><p>will allow the Kurdish people the opportunity </p><p>to live peacefully with a Kurdish </p><p>identification in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Our meetings also reveal Kurds believe </p><p>the first step to improving relations with the </p><p>GOT is the freedom to identify themselves as </p><p>Kurdish.  However, our contacts also suggest </p><p>that until Turkey completes its democratization </p><p>process, this issue cannot be resolved; </p><p>Turkey\'s current procedures, institutions, and </p><p>Constitution are not equipped to permit ethnic </p><p>groups, such as the Kurds, the opportunity to </p><p>practice their traditions and live peacefully </p><p>with other groups.  Our contacts conclude that </p><p>continued and strengthened pressure by the USG, </p><p>as well as other international bodies such as </p><p>the European Union, on the GOT, to fully </p><p>democratize will give way to a peaceful </p><p>solution to the tensions between the GOT and </p><p>the Kurdish people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Prominent Adana Kurdish activists stress </p><p>that amnesty would give PKK/KADEK members the </p><p>opportunity to integrate into society creating </p><p>peace in the country.  They emphasize that the </p><p>Kurdish people have lived peacefully with their </p><p>neighbors in the region, including Iraq, and </p><p>the GOT must play a facilitating role to </p><p>maintain this.  These Kurdish leaders believe </p><p>amnesty would allow PKK/KADEK members the </p><p>ability to live free of in fear of GOT </p><p>repercussion for their previous acts, and allow </p><p>them to fully lay down their arms and establish </p><p>a peaceful role for themselves and their </p><p>families within society. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>"If they won\'t accept the Turkish Flag, they </p><p>shouldn\'t integrate into Turkish society!" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU)  Our local GOT contacts, however, say </p><p>such an amnesty is not a feasible solution; </p><p>nationalistic or ethnic identification only </p><p>lends to the divisions within Turkish society. </p><p>The opportunity to give such an amnesty would </p><p>strengthen Kurdish identity and continue to </p><p>divide the country.  According to one contact, </p><p>Kurdish people prefer to identify themselves </p><p>with the smaller, "Kurdish" identity rather </p><p>than the "Turkish" national identity; </p><p>consequently, this regional identity leads to a </p><p>weakening of society by dividing the country. </p><p>Other contacts add that amnesty only achieves </p><p>its purpose if both the perpetrator and the </p><p>victim are in agreement.  If the crimes are </p><p>political in nature and hence committed against </p><p>the State, the State may grant amnesty; but, if </p><p>the crimes are against another person, only the </p><p>victim or his/her family may grant amnesty. </p><p>They argue that while some of the PKK/KADEK\'s </p><p>crimes were political, many innocent families </p><p>lost loved ones in the war; it should be their </p><p>choice whether to grant amnesty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: Kurdish contacts in the </p><p>Southeast are optimistic that the </p><p>disappointment suffered by the United States </p><p>when the Turkish Parliament failed to pass the </p><p>motion allowing US troops to be based out of </p><p>Turkey will encourage the United States to give </p><p>more credence to their plight and less sympathy </p><p>to the GOT.  However, aspirations for an </p><p>amnesty are unrealistic; the most the Turkish </p><p>State might be willing to bear in a broadened </p><p>repentance law.  Even that would not resolve </p><p>the problem without attendant economic </p><p>incentives and social measures.  In this regard </p><p>we see no signs either that Ankara has any </p><p>creative ideas or that Kurdish businessmen or </p><p>groups in the Southeast are willing to take </p><p>initiatives on their own.    End comment. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
