<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF A/S SUSAN E. RICE, PDAS POWELL, </p><p>DAS SCHNEIDMAN, AF/S DIRECTOR RENDER, DESK OFFICER </p><p>GURNEY, SA/INS FOR STEVE KRAFT </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR AFRICA GAYLE SMITH </p><p>DEPT ALSO PLEASE PASS AID, PASS TO USTR FOR ROSA </p><p>WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/26/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF ZIMBABWE ELECTION </p><p>PROSPECTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2121 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MCDONALD FOR 1.5 (B), (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY. WE HAVE BEGUN AN ANALYSIS OF </p><p>POSSIBLE RESULTS IN THE COMING ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BASED ON A DATABASE OF </p><p>VOTING DISTRICTS.  IN A ROUGH FIRST CUT, LOOKING </p><p>ONLY AT THE IMPORTANT URBAN-RURAL SPLIT IN </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES, WE BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PARTY COULD COLLECT </p><p>SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 45 AND 55 SEATS.  OUR ANALYSIS </p><p>HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RURAL VOTE, WHICH </p><p>CONTROLS TWO-THIRDS OF THE CURRENT CONSTITUENCIES. </p><p>THIS PUTS THE RULING PARTY\'S ONGOING CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>INTIMIDATION IN RURAL AREAS IN A CLEARER LIGHT: </p><p>THEY ARE FIGHTING TO SAVE THEIR POLITICAL SKINS. A </p><p>LOCAL MDC-LEANING POLITICAL SCIENTIST, WHO CONDUCTS </p><p>POLLS TO PREDICT AND ANALYZE VOTING, UNDERLINED THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF A LARGE MDC WIN--MAYBE EVEN CONTROL </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT--IF THEY CAN STYMIE ZANU-PF ATTEMPTS </p><p>TO SUPPRESS THEM. END SUMMARY. </p><p>  BEGINNING ANALYSIS WITH THE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THERE ARE CLEARLY MANY IMPONDERABLES AT </p><p>THIS STAGE OF THE ELECTION CYCLE.  EVEN A SHORT </p><p>LIST MUST INCLUDE: WHEN THE VOTE WILL BE HELD; THE </p><p>DEGREE OF OPENNESS WITH WHICH IT WILL BE CONDUCTED; </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02236  01 OF 03  261350Z </p><p>THE EFFECTS OF THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN TO USE VIOLENCE </p><p>TO INTIMIDATE RURAL SUPPORTERS OF THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY, MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC); THE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF INDEPENDENT PARTIES AND PRESS; AND </p><p>POSSIBLE GERRYMANDERING FAVORING ZANU-PF IN THE </p><p>ONGOING PROCESS OF DELIMITING VOTING DISTRICTS. </p><p>NONETHELESS, SOME OUTLINES OF POSSIBLE ELECTION </p><p>RESULTS CAN BE DISCERNED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FOR OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS, WE HAVE </p><p>CLASSIFIED THE CURRENT 120 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES BY WHAT PROVINCE THEY ARE IN AND </p><p>THEIR DEGREE OF URBANIZATION.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>REFINE THIS DATABASE AND ADD ADDITIONAL VARIABLES. </p><p>AS A BACKGROUND NOTE, UNDER THE CURRENT </p><p>CONSTITUTION THE PRESIDENT APPOINTS 30 MEMBERS TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT, WITH THE RESULT THAT TO ACHIEVE A </p><p>MAJORITY, AN OPPOSITION PARTY WILL HAVE TO SEE AT </p><p>LEAST 76 MEMBERS ELECTED. </p><p> </p><p>  ASSUMING MDC URBAN SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) BECAUSE THE IMPONDERABLES SURROUNDING THE </p><p>ELECTION ARE SO LARGE, OUR ANALYSIS AT THIS TIME IS </p><p>NECESSARILY VERY ROUGH.  WE HAVE CLASSIFIED </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES INTO EITHER RURAL OR NON-RURAL </p><p>(INCLUDING CITIES, TOWNS, AND SUBURBS).  AS A FIRST </p><p>CUT AT LOOKING AT POSSIBLE ELECTION RESULTS, WE </p><p>ASSUME THE MDC WILL LARGELY CARRY THE URBAN AREAS </p><p>AND THE RULING ZANU-PF WILL LARGELY TAKE THE RURAL </p><p>AREAS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02236  01 OF 03  261350Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MDC WILL TAKE </p><p>90 PERCENT OF CURRENT NON-RURAL CONSTITUENCIES </p><p>WHILE ZANU-PF TAKES 90 PERCENT OF THE RURAL AREAS, </p><p>MDC WOULD GARNER ABOUT 46 SEATS AND ZANU-PF WOULD </p><p>TAKE ABOUT 74.  IF MDC MANAGES TO HOLD ITS URBAN </p><p>BASE AT THE 90 PERCENT LEVEL AND INCREASE ITS </p><p>APPEAL TO 15 PERCENT OF THE RURAL CONSTITUENCIES, </p><p>ITS SEAT TOTAL WOULD GO TO 50, AND ZANU-PF WOULD </p><p>HOLD 70. </p><p>  IMPORTANT VOTING DISTRICTS NOT SET </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ONE OF THE MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCKS TO </p><p>SCHEDULING THE ELECTION HAS BEEN THE NEED FOR THE </p><p>DELIMITATION COMMISSION, UNDER SUPREME COURT </p><p>JUSTICE WILSON SANDURA, TO COMPLETE A REVISION OF </p><p>THE PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCIES.  IN A RECENT </p><p>CONVERSATION (REFTEL), HE TOLD US HE THOUGHT IT </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT THE PATTERN OF THE LAST DELIMITATION </p><p>EXERCISE, WHICH SAW AN INCREASE IN URBAN </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES AT THE EXPENSE OF RURAL ONES, WOULD </p><p>BE REPEAT </p><p>ED.  AS A PRELIMINARY CUT AT WHAT RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
