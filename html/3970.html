(U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST, PLEASE SEE LAST PARA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE POPE, CATHOLIC </p><p>PATRIARCH OF JERUSALEM MICHEL SABBAH MADE AN URGENT PLEA TO </p><p>AMBASSADOR OCTOBER 10 FOR U.S. HELP TO STOP THE VIOLENCE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04991  01 OF 03  141419Z </p><p>AMELIORATE THE INCREASINGLY DESPERATE PLIGHT OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, AND MOVE THE PARTIES TOWARD MEANINGFUL </p><p>DIALOGUE.  SABBAH HAD MET WITH THE POPE THE DAY BEFORE TO </p><p>CONVEY HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN JERUSALEM AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES.  ACCORDING TO SABBAH, BOTH THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN AND ISRAELI PEOPLE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT </p><p>THE CURRENT CYCLE OF VIOLENCE SERVED NO PURPOSE, BUT THEY </p><p>NEEDED TO BE "SAVED" FROM THEIR CURRENT BLOODY IMPASSE BY </p><p>OUTSIDE PRESSURE.  ONLY U.S. INTERVENTION, HE INSISTED, COULD </p><p>MOVE THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT FROM ITS CURRENT POLICY OF </p><p>REPRESSION.  SABBAH, WHO PARTICIPATES IN THE "ALEXANDRIA </p><p>GROUP" -- AN INTER-FAITH RELIGIOUS FORUM ENCOMPASSING </p><p>CHRISTIAN, JEWISH, AND MUSLIM LEADERS -- ASSERTED THAT THIS </p><p>GROUP HAD CONTACTS WITH HAMAS AND THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, </p><p>AND COULD SECURE A CESSATION IN TERRORIST ATTACKS OF "MORE </p><p>THAN A MONTH" IF ONLY THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT WOULD OFFER A </p><p>"REAL PROMISE" OF EASING THE PALESTINIANS\' SUFFERING.  SABBAH </p><p>CONDEMNED PALESTINIAN TERRORISM AND "HATE SPEECH", BUT SAID </p><p>IT WAS A MANIFESTATION OF PALESTINIAN DESPERATION THAT WOULD </p><p>STOP ONLY WHEN THE OCCUPATION AND "WAR" ENDED.  SEEING NO </p><p>SIGNS THAT THE SHARON GOVERNMENT WAS INTERESTED IN PEACE, </p><p>SABBAH ASKED THE AMBASSADOR TO CONVEY TO THE PRESIDENT HIS </p><p>URGENT PLEA FOR INTERVENTION FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO </p><p>SECURE SOME MEANINGFUL CONCESSION FROM THE GOI THAT WOULD </p><p>GIVE THE ALEXANDRIA GROUP THE LEVERAGE IT NEEDED TO SECURE A </p><p>CESSATION OF VIOLENCE FROM THE ARAB SIDE AND SET IN PLACE THE </p><p>BEGINNINGS OF REAL PEACE TALKS LEADING TO AN END TO ISRAELI </p><p>OCCUPATION. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>MOUNTING DESPERATION IN PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04991  01 OF 03  141419Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AMBASSADOR RECEIVED A CALL FROM VATICAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER EQUIVALENT ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN OCTOBER 10, </p><p>WHO CONVEYED THE POPE\'S REQUEST THAT THE AMBASSADOR MEET THAT </p><p>DAY WITH VISITING PATRIARCH OF JERUSALEM MICHEL SABBAH, WHO </p><p>WAS IN ROME TO SEE THE POPE ABOUT THE DETERIORATING SITUATION </p><p>IN THE HOLY LANDS.  MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR AND STAFF, </p><p>SABBAH AND THE VICAR OF JERUSALEM MADE AN URGENT, ALMOST </p><p>DESPERATE PLEA FOR UNITED STATES INTERVENTION TO STOP THE </p><p>VIOLENCE AND END THE UNTENABLE SITUATION FOR THE PALESTINIANS </p><p>IN THE HOLY LANDS.  HE SAID THAT THE CURFEW FORBADE THEIR </p><p>MOVEMENT 24 HOURS PER DAY AND DEPRIVED THEM OF BASIC HUMAN </p><p>NECESSITIES.  HE FURTHER SAID THAT BOTH THE PALESTINIAN AND </p><p>ISRAELI PEOPLE NEEDED "PROTECTION" AND "SALVATION" IN THE </p><p>FORM OF A U.S. OR UN MILITARY PRESENCE THAT WOULD PROVIDE </p><p>SECURITY FOR ALL.  SABBAH ASSERTED THAT THE ARAB WORLD WAS </p><p>READY FOR PEACE, THE PALESTINIAN WORLD WAS READY, AND THE </p><p>TIME WAS RIGHT FOR A MOVE TO PEACE.  "THERE IS NO REASON FOR </p><p>THIS WAR TO GO ON," HE INSISTED.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT APPEARED </p><p>TO HIM THAT THE SHARON GOVERNMENT HAD "NO INTEREST IN PEACE." </p><p> SABBAH SAID THAT EVENTUALLY THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE (AND RETURN </p><p>TO THE 1967 BOUNDARIES), AND THAT SINCE PEOPLE WERE DYING </p><p>EVERY DAY, IT WAS POINTLESS NOT TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION NOW </p><p>AND SAVE MANY LIVES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SABBAH SKETCHED A GRIM PICTURE OF PALESTINIAN DAILY </p><p>LIFE UNDER SIEGE AND CURFEW, WITH SCHOOLS CLOSED, LIMITED </p><p>MOVEMENT POSSIBLE ONLY FOR THREE HOURS THREE TIMES A WEEK, NO </p><p>ECONOMIC LIFE, AND NO PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.  HARSH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04991  01 OF 03  141419Z </p><p>ISRAELI REPRESSION, SABBAH NOTED, HAS NOT RESULTED IN GREATER </p><p>SECURITY FOR THE ISRAELI PEOPLE.  ON THE CONTRARY, "EVEN THE </p><p>ISRAELIS" WERE SUFFERING, HE SAID.  WITH PALESTINIANS LIVING </p><p>UNDER SUCH DESPERATION, SABBAH SAID IT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE </p><p>THAT SOME WOULD RESORT TO "IMMORAL ACTS" LIKE SUICIDE </p><p>BOMBING.  HE CONDEMNED TERRORIST ACTS AS "MORALLY WRONG AND </p><p>STRATEGICALLY WRONG," BUT ADDED THAT MOST PALESTINIANS CLAIM </p><p>"AS LONG AS THE ISRAELIS ARE IN OUR TERRITORY MAKING WAR ON </p><p>US, WE WILL MAKE WAR ON THEM."  HE LAMENTED THAT PALESTINIANS </p><p>WERE CONDEMNED FOR SUICIDE BOMBINGS, WHILE ISRAEL WAS ABLE TO </p><p>KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND DESTROY PROPERTY BY TRADITIONAL </p><p>MILITARY MEANS THAT EARNED LESS APPROBATION FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>ONLY THE U.S. CAN SAVE US FROM OURSELVES </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) WITH THE VIOLENCE AND OCCUPATION PRESSURES </p><p>UNRELENTING, SABBAH FEARED THAT THE SHARON GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>DEAF TO ANY DIALOGUE, AND THEREFORE BELIEVED THAT ONLY THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO2589 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  04991  02 OF 03  141420Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NEA-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------F6E3EA  141420Z /38 </p><p>O 141342Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>INFO ARAB ISRAELI COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 VATICAN 004991 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI, NEA/IAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, IS, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: JERUSALEM PATRIARCH PLEAS FOR U.S. INTERVENTION </p><p>WITH ISRAEL TO END DESPERATE PLIGHT IN PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES </p><p> </p><p>BUSH ADMINISTRATION COULD GET THROUGH.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE GOI WAS NOT ALWAYS RESPONSIVE TO U.S. </p><p>DEMANDS, SABBAH REPLIED: "IF YOU CAN\'T MOVE SHARON, THEN ALL </p><p>IS LOST FOR THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE."  HE NOTED THAT THE ISSUE </p><p>IS HOW MUCH PRESSURE THE U.S. WAS WILLING TO BRING TO BEAR ON </p><p>SHARON.  IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH PRESSURE, HE FEARED THERE </p><p>WOULD BE FIVE OR TEN MORE YEARS OF VIOLENCE UNTIL A NEW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04991  02 OF 03  141420Z </p><p>ISRAELI GOVERNMENT BROUGHT IT TO AN END AND BEGAN A NEW </p><p>DIALOGUE.  IN THE MEANTIME THOUSANDS WOULD DIE.  SABBAH </p><p>REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT WE CONVEY TO THE PRESIDENT HIS </p><p>URGENT PLEA FOR AN INTERVENTION WITH SHARON TO CONVINCE HIM </p><p>TO EASE THE SITUATION IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES AND JOIN </p><p>IN STEPS TOWARD A LASTING CEASEFIRE.  SABBAH NOTED THAT HE </p><p>AND THE OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS OF JERUSALEM HAD PREVIOUSLY </p><p>REQUESTED A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND HOPED TO BE ABLE </p><p>TO PRESENT THEIR CONCERNS DIRECTLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p>AMBASSADOR PROMISED TO CONVEY SABBAH\'S COMMENTS DIRECTLY TO </p><p>WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AMBASSADOR ASKED SABBAH ABOUT THE STATUS OF HIS OWN </p><p>EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE WITH THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. </p><p>SABBAH SAID HE HAS MET WITH DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER MELCHIOR, </p><p>THE ONLY GOI OFFICIAL WHO REGULARLY SPOKE WITH HIM, BUT THAT </p><p>MELCHIOR MAKES CLEAR THAT HE CANNOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND GENERALLY PROMISES ONLY TO CONVEY SABBAH\'S </p><p>CONCERNS.  HE SAID HE HAS HAD A REQUEST IN TO MEET DIRECTLY </p><p>WITH PM SHARON FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT THE PM\'S OFFICE HAS </p><p>NOT RESPONDED.  HE BELIEVED SHARON WAS NOT INTERESTED IN </p><p>PEACE, AND WAS BENT ON EXPELLING ALL BUT A FEW THOUSAND </p><p>PALESTINIANS FROM THE WEST BANK IN ORDER TO CREATE A GREATER </p><p>ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>ALEXANDRIA GROUP: CEASEFIRE POSSIBLE WITH ISRAELI COMMITMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) SABBAH TOLD US THAT THE "ALEXANDRIA GROUP" OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS LEADERS FROM THE MUSLIN, JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04991  02 OF 03  141420Z </p><p>FAITHS CREATED LAST JANUARY MAINTAINS GOOD CONTACTS WITH </p><p>HAMAS AND THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY.  SABBAH SAID HE HAD </p><p>ASKED HAMAS WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO STOP THE VIOLENCE AND THE </p><p>REPLY WAS THAT AS LONG AS THE OCCUPATION CONTINUED, HAMAS WAS </p><p>AT "WAR"; WHEN THE OCCUPATION CEASED, THE WAR WOULD BE OVER. </p><p>HE SAID THAT AFTER THEY HAD SPOKEN WITH SHEIK YASSIM, HAMAS </p><p>HAD REFRAINED FROM ATTACKS FOR OVER FOUR WEEKS.  DURING THAT </p><p>PERIOD, HE SAID, THE ISRAELI SIDE HAD CONTINUED ITS </p><p>OCCUPATION AND ASSASSINATION POLICY, AND SO THE TERROR </p><p>ATTACKS WERE RENEWED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  PRESSED BY THE AMBASSADOR ABOUT CURRENT DIFFICULTIES </p><p>IN ESTABLISHING AN IMPROVED SECURITY SITUATION WITHOUT </p><p>PALESTINIAN SUICIDE ATTACKS, SABBAH INSISTED THAT THE </p><p>ALEXANDRIA GROUP COULD USE ITS GOOD OFFICES TO OBTAIN A REAL </p><p>CESSATION IN THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, FROM HAMAS, THE PA, AND </p><p>POTENTIALLY EVEN HIZBOLLAH, FOR "A MONTH."  BUT THEY COULD DO </p><p>SO ONLY IF THEY HAD SOMETHING CONCRETE FROM THE ISRAELI SIDE </p><p>TO TAKE TO THE TABLE.  AT AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY AS TO WHAT WOULD </p><p>TYPE OF STEPS WOULD BE NEEDED FROM THE ISRAELI SIDE TO </p><p>ACHIEVE SUCH A CESSATION OF ATTACKS, SABBAH CONCEDED THAT </p><p>SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A REAL PLEDGE FROM THE GOI TO EASE THE </p><p>CURFEWS FOR A WEEK COULD CREATE A FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO </p><p>BUILD, FOLLOWED BY A RETURN TO "A MORE NORMAL LIFE." </p><p>FOLLOWING UP ON SABBAH\'S INDICATION THAT THE ALEXANDRIA GROUP </p><p>WOULD BE MEETING UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF </p><p>CANTERBURY OCTOBER 24-25 AT LAMBETH HOUSE IN LONDON, </p><p>AMBASSADOR URGED SABBAH TO DEVELOP HIS PROPOSAL WITHIN THE </p><p>ALEXANDRIA GROUP.  WHILE CAUTIONING THAT IT WOULD BE A </p><p>DIFFICULT TASK TO SET THE ALEXANDRIA GROUP OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS ON A POLITICAL PATH, HE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04991  02 OF 03  141420Z </p><p>EXPLORE WAYS IN WHICH THE GROUP COULD PROMOTE A CESSATION OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND CREATE SOME SPACE FOR A RESTORATION OF DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP AND REFORM </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) RESPONDING TO U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>POLITICAL REFORM AND RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES, SABBAH DISMISSED THESE AS "SECONDARY </p><p>CONCERNS."  "EVEN WITH THE BEST ADMINISTRATION, FREE FROM </p><p>CORRUPTION, VIOLENCE WILL STILL BE THERE IF NOTHING IS DONE </p><p>ABOUT THE OCCUPATION," HE OBSERVED.  ON THE LEADERSHIP ISSUE, </p><p>SABBAH CAUTIONED THAT U.S. AND ISRAELI PRESSURE TO GET RID OF </p><p>ARAFAT WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.  "THE MORE YOU SAY THAT </p><p>ARAFAT IS IRRELEVANT, THE MORE RELEVANT HE BECOMES."  WHEREAS </p><p>IF THE U.S. AND ISRAEL JUST IGNORED HIM AND LET THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF IT, "YOU WILL GET THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP YOU WANT," HE ADDED.  HE DESCRIBED ARAFAT AS </p><p>"PRISONER," WHO COULD DO NOTHING, AND TO WHOM NO ONE LISTENS, </p><p>BUT WHO GROWS IN POPULARITY THE MORE HE IS HUMILIATED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0374 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  04991  03 OF 03  141420Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NEA-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------F6E3F1  141420Z /38 </p><p>O 141342Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>INFO ARAB ISRAELI COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 VATICAN 004991 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI, NEA/IAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, IS, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: JERUSALEM PATRIARCH PLEAS FOR U.S. INTERVENTION </p><p>WITH ISRAEL TO END DESPERATE PLIGHT IN PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.

WHILE WE ARE CONFIDENT SABBAH MAINTAINS TIES TO </p><p>BOTH HAMAS AND THE PA, AND MAY BE ABLE TO PLAY A USEFUL ROLE </p><p>IN CONSTRAINING ATTACKS, WE LEAVE IT TO WASHINGTON, TEL AVIV </p><p>AND JERUSALEM TO ASSESS WHETHER THESE TIES WOULD BE STRONG </p><p>ENOUGH TO HELP ACHIEVE A CESSATION OF SUICIDE ATTACKS, AS HE </p><p>MAINTAINS.  GIVEN THE CURRENT IMPASSE, HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT INTER-FAITH RELIGIOUS EFFORTS SUCH AS THAT OF THE </p><p>ALEXANDRIA GROUP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE CREATION OF SOME </p><p>DIALOGUE IN A SITUATION WHERE VERY LITTLE EXISTS.  IN ANY </p><p>EVENT, SABBAH\'S DESPERATE PLEA FOR GREATER U.S. ENGAGEMENT -- </p><p>A PLEA ECHOED IN EVERY MEETING WITH SENIOR HOLY SEE OFFICIALS </p><p>-- REFLECTS A STRONGLY HELD VIEW HERE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF </p><p>GREATER U.S. PRESSURE ON SHARON, THERE IS NO HOPE FOR AN END </p><p>TO THE TRAGIC CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  SABBAH, </p><p>A PALESTINIAN NATIONALIST AND A CATHOLIC CLERGYMAN, </p><p>UNDERSCORED TO THE AMBASSADOR HIS CONDEMNATION BOTH OF </p><p>TERRORISM AND THE HATE SPEECH THAT EXISTS IN PALESTINIAN </p><p>MEDIA AND SCHOOLS.  HE SAID HE PREACHES TO HIS OWN FLOCK TO </p><p>"LOVE THE ISRAELIS, EVEN THOSE WHO DRIVE TANKS OVER YOUR </p><p>HOUSES."  THIS WAS "HARD TO DO," HE ADDED, "BUT IT IS THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN THING TO DO."   ACTION REQUEST: EMBASSY IS PREPARED </p><p>TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE HOLY SEE ON THIS TRACK IF THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT BELIEVES IT WILL BE HELPFUL IN ENCOURAGING </p><p>DIALOGUE AND REDUCING VIOLENCE.
