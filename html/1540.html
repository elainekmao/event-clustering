(C) SUMMARY: THE MAJORITY OF ZIMBABWE\'S RULING ZANU- </p><p>PF PARTY MEMBERS ARE UNHAPPY WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE AND </p><p>THE WAY HE IS RUNNING THE COUNTRY, BUT THEY WILL NOT </p><p>OFFER MORE THAN PASSIVE RESISTANCE TO HIS DESTRUCTIVE </p><p>POLICIES, OUR CONTACTS TELL US.  THERE IS NOT LIKELY TO </p><p>BE MUCH ENTHUSIASM FOR CAMPAIGNING FOR MUGABE IN THE </p><p>UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, ACCORDING TO A FORMER </p><p>ZANU-PF MP.  THE ONLY ENTHUSIASTIC CAMPAIGNERS -- AND </p><p>POTENTIAL MUGABE SUCCESSORS -- WILL BE THOSE WHO HAVE </p><p>BENEFITED RECENTLY FROM ZANU-PF\'S REWARD SYSTEM.  A SNAP </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS UNLIKELY BECAUSE IT IS TOO </p><p>RISKY FOR MUGABE, ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES.  MEANWHILE, </p><p>SOME REFORM-MINDED "YOUNG TURKS" ARE ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>MODERATE THE PARTY\'S MORE OUTLANDISH SWIPES AT THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW.  FOR MOST ZANU-PF MEMBERS, HOWEVER, SURVIVAL IS </p><p>THE BYWORD OF THE DAY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PARLIAMENT: A HOUSE BITTERLY DIVIDED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00816  01 OF 02  231135Z </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 15, POLOFF MET WITH MICHAEL MATAURE, </p><p>A FORMER ZANU-PF MP FOR CHIMANIMANI AND CURRENT HEAD OF </p><p>A LOCAL NGO THAT FOCUSES ON PARLIAMENTARY ISSUES AND </p><p>WORKS WITH MPS.  (COMMENT: TOWARD THE END OF HIS TENURE </p><p>IN THE LAST PARLIAMENT, MATAURE WAS AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC </p><p>OF ZANU-PF\'S TOP-DOWN STRUCTURE AND ATTEMPTS TO QUASH </p><p>INTERNAL DISSENT.  END COMMENT.)  MATAURE DESCRIBED THE </p><p>CURRENT ATMOSPHERE IN PARLIAMENT AS "POISONED" SINCE </p><p>MOST MPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE SEE ISSUES ONLY </p><p>THROUGH A POLITICAL PRISM.  (NOTE:  THIS SENTIMENT WAS </p><p>ALSO EXPRESSED BY WEBSTER SHAMU, ZANU-PF MP FOR CHEGUTU, </p><p>IN A CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF FEBRUARY 13.  END NOTE.) </p><p>MATAURE REPORTED THAT LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN </p><p>THE IMPEACHMENT EFFORT AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE BECAUSE </p><p>THE ZANU-PF CHAIR IS USING ALL MANNER OF DELAYING </p><p>TACTICS TO DRAG OUT THE PROCEEDINGS.  NO HEARINGS TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE THE CHARGES AGAINST THE PRESIDENT HAVE BEEN </p><p>SCHEDULED, HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF REMAINS QUIETLY DISGRUNTLED </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MATAURE CONTINUED BY DESCRIBING ZANU-PF AS A </p><p>"DISGRUNTLED" AND "DIVIDED" PARTY, THE RECENT STRING OF </p><p>BY-ELECTION VICTORIES NOTWITHSTANDING.  THERE IS A </p><p>"SILENT MAJORITY" OF ZANU-PF MEMBERS WHO DO NOT APPROVE </p><p>OF PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S VIOLENT TACTICS TO COW OPPONENTS </p><p>AND WANT HIM TO LEAVE POWER, BUT THEY FEEL THEY HAVE TO </p><p>KEEP QUIET ON THE SUBJECT OR THEIR CAREERS WILL MEET AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00816  01 OF 02  231135Z </p><p>UNGLORIOUS END. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PAUL MANGWANA, A YOUNG ZANU-PF MP FOR KADOMA </p><p>EAST AND DEPUTY MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS, CONVEYED A SIMILAR VIEW TO POLOFF IN A </p><p>SEPARATE CONVERSATION FEBRUARY 22.  MANGWANA STATED THAT </p><p>AS A MINORITY IN THE PARTY, THE REFORM-MINDED "YOUNG </p><p>TURK" GROUP (A GROUP TO WHICH MANGWANA WOULD APPEAR TO </p><p>BELONG) CANNOT SPEAK OUT DIRECTLY AGAINST THE OLD GUARD. </p><p>INSTEAD, THEY WORK QUIETLY BEHIND THE SCENES, </p><p>ESSENTIALLY "GANGING UP" ON ONE OR TWO OLDER MEMBERS AT </p><p>A TIME IN AN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE THEIR OPINION OR </p><p>POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MANGWANA CITED THE EXAMPLE OF THE ZANU-PF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY MOTION TABLED FEBRUARY 22 TO ASK PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE TO ESTABLISH A TRIBUNAL TO INVESTIGATE THE </p><p>CONDUCT OF CERTAIN HIGH AND SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. </p><p>(NOTE: THE FEBRUARY 23 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" REPORTED THAT THE MDC CLAIMED </p><p>THE MOTION IS POTENTIALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND DEBATE ON </p><p>IT WILL BE DELAYED UNTIL FEBRUARY 27.  END NOTE.)  THE </p><p>MP CLAIMED THE ORIGINAL MOTION WRITTEN BY JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA WOULD HAVE CALLED FOR THE </p><p>DISMISSAL OF NEARLY THE ENTIRE HIGH AND SUPREME COURT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2866 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00816  02 OF 02  231136Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------C96009  231136Z /38 </p><p>P 231134Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8284 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000816 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SA C.

MANGWANA WENT </p><p>AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT CHINAMASA HAD BEEN EXCESSIVE IN </p><p>HIS CONDEMNATION OF THE JUDICIARY AND THAT HE SHOULD NOT </p><p>PAINT THE WHOLE JUDICIARY WITH THE SAME BRUSH.  MANGWANA </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHINAMASA\'S ACTIONS </p><p>ON ZIMBABWE\'S INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION, AND HOPED THAT </p><p>TRIBUNALS INVESTIGATING SELECTED JUSTICES (PRESUMABLY </p><p>INSTEAD OF PERPETUATING THE TREND OF THINLY VEILED </p><p>THREATS) WOULD RESTORE SOME SEMBLANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW </p><p>TO ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>LITTLE ENTHUSIASM FOR MUGABE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE LEVEL OF UNHAPPINESS IN ZANU-PF WITH MUGABE </p><p>IS LIKELY TO TRANSLATE INTO A LACK OF ENTHUSIASM FOR </p><p>MUGABE\'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MATAURE THEORIZED.  IT </p><p>IS TELLING, HE SAID, HOW LITTLE CABINET MEMBERS AND </p><p>OTHER ZANU-PF MEMBERS HAVE VOICED PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR </p><p>MUGABE SINCE THE DECEMBER PARTY CONGRESS (REFTEL).  THE </p><p>FEW WHO DO ACTIVELY CAMPAIGN FOR MUGABE ARE THE ONES TO </p><p>BE VIEWED AS MUGABE\'S POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS, MATAURE </p><p>ASSERTED, EVEN CALLING THEM THE PRESIDENT\'S "RUNNING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00816  02 OF 02  231136Z </p><p>MATES."  YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MINISTER BORDER GEZI, LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT MINISTER IGNATIUS CHOMBO, AND SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA ARE POTENTIAL "RUNNING </p><p>MATES" BECAUSE OF THEIR UNSWERVING LOYALTY TO MUGABE. </p><p>THE PRESIDENT VALUES LOYALTY ABOVE ALL ELSE, MATAURE </p><p>ARGUED, AND DOLES OUT PATRONAGE BASED ON THAT </p><p>ALLEGIANCE.  THE NEEDS OF THIS REWARD SYSTEM AND THE </p><p>PARTY ARE "PARAMOUNT" BEFORE THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY, </p><p>HE OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A SNAP </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THIS YEAR, MATAURE DESCRIBED THAT </p><p>SCENARIO AS VERY RISKY FOR MUGABE, AND THEREFORE, </p><p>UNLIKELY.  THE PRESIDENT IS SO UNPOPULAR RIGHT NOW, HE </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO DEPLOY 250,000 PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY </p><p>TO CANVASS FOR HIM, AND ZANU-PF SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE THE </p><p>RESOURCES TO MOUNT SUCH A CAMPAIGN, THE FORMER MP </p><p>STATED.  THE ONLY WAY MUGABE COULD WIN IS IF THERE WAS A </p><p>THREE- OR FOUR-WAY RACE AMONG HIGH-PROFILE CANDIDATES </p><p>THAT ESSENTIALLY SPLIT THE OPPOSITION VOTE, MATAURE </p><p>SUGGESTED, AND THAT DOES NOT APPEAR LIKELY AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: ALL WE WANT IS TO SURVIVE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) OUR ZANU-PF CONTACTS PAINT A PICTURE OF AN </p><p>UNHAPPY AND MOSTLY POWERLESS PARTY MAJORITY BIDING ITS </p><p>TIME UNTIL THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WHICH MUST BE HELD </p><p>BY APRIL 1, 2002.  THOSE WHO ARE NOT WILLING TO TRY TO </p><p>MODERATE THE RULING PARTY\'S WORST EXCESSES FROM BEHIND </p><p>THE SCENES ARE LYING LOW UNTIL THE STORM BLOWS OVER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00816  02 OF 02  231136Z </p><p>POLITICAL SURVIVAL IS THE BYWORD IN THIS CURRENT PERIOD </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY\'S HISTORY THAT IS AKIN TO MAO\'S CULTURAL </p><p>REVOLUTION.  THE ONLY TOOL LEFT FOR THE DISBELIEVERS IS </p><p>PASSIVE RESISTANCE.  THE OUTSPOKEN MINORITY OF PARTY </p><p>LEADERS WILLING TO USE VIOLENCE, HARASSMENT AND OTHER </p><p>EXTRALEGAL MEANS TO CARRY OUT THE PRESIDENT\'S PLANS, </p><p>SUCH AS GEZI, CHINAMASA, AND INFORMATION MINISTER </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO, WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD SWAY IN THE NEAR </p><p>TERM.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
