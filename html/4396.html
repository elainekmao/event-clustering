(C) As expected, the IMF mission did not/not reach </p><p>agreement with the GOH on draft terms of a three-year Poverty </p><p>Reduction and Growth Facility Program (PRGF) during its </p><p>November 4-15 visit to Honduras.  In consultations with the </p><p>IMF mission, the GOH developed a plan to improve the fiscal </p><p>situation in the next few months.  If all goes well, the team </p><p>will return to Honduras in March or April to begin </p><p>negotiations on a program.  The delay of a program will put </p><p>into jeopardy USD 240 million in debt relief, concessional </p><p>loans and grants from some donors.  It also puts into doubt </p><p>the utility of a Consultative Group meeting currently planned </p><p>for February 3-4.  Two or three donors were highly critical </p><p>of the IMF\'s approach.  The IMF countered that the situation </p><p>is unsustainable, unless donors want to continue to fund </p><p>public sector salaries for Honduras year in and year out, and </p><p>watch investment in poverty reduction programs continue to </p><p>dwindle.  Embassy recommends supporting the IMF on its push </p><p>for real fiscal and economic reform in Honduras.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Deteriorating Finances Dragging Down the Economy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In a briefing for key donors (the G-15) on November </p><p>15, the head of the IMF mission, Mario Garza, said that the </p><p>IMF is very worried about the current economic situation. </p><p>The economy remains depressed, primarily because of the </p><p>fiscal policy pursued in 2001 and 2002.  If nothing is </p><p>changed, the policy will continue to drag down the Honduran </p><p>economy in 2003.  Garza commended the improvements in revenue </p><p>collection which the GOH has realized since passage of the </p><p>tax reforms last spring; however, he noted that this </p><p>improvement in tax administration will only arrest the </p><p>alarming growth in the government\'s budget deficit.  It will </p><p>not put the GOH\'s finances on a sustainable path. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Garza explained that the key figure the mission </p><p>looked at is public sector savings (revenues minus current </p><p>expenditures for the central government and other public </p><p>sector entities), because it provides an indication of the </p><p>amount of funds the government is able to generate for </p><p>capital investment and discretionary social programs.  Public </p><p>sector savings declined from nine percent of GDP in 1999 to </p><p>two percent in 2002 (a staggering decline of seven percentage </p><p>points).  With savings that weak, the government is unable to </p><p>fund the needed social programs from its own resources; it </p><p>has come to rely on foreign aid to do so.  To highlight the </p><p>enormous size of the foregone public sector savings each </p><p>year, IMF PermRep Chungsuk Cha added that the planned HIPC </p><p>debt relief (a one-time benefit for government finances for </p><p>Highly Indebted Poor Countries) is ten percent of GDP.  This </p><p>figure pales in significance compared to losses every year of </p><p>seven percent of GDP because of the GOH\'s current fiscal </p><p>policy.  In its press release, the IMF mission pointed out </p><p>that Honduran exports and imports have contracted and that </p><p>the lack of investment was an important contributor to the </p><p>problem (as well as the decline in key commodity prices). </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Causes for the declining public sector savings can </p><p>be found both on the expenditure and revenue sides.  For </p><p>example, current expenditures (primarily salaries) for the </p><p>central government rose from 16.7 percent of GDP in 1999 to </p><p>18.6 percent in 2001 and 18.9 percent in 2002.  At the same </p><p>time, taxes declined from 17.5 percent of GDP in 1999 to 16.2 </p><p>percent in 2001 and 15.6 percent in 2002.  The public sector </p><p>wage bill has risen from 8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 10 </p><p>percent of GDP in 2001 and almost eleven percent in 2002. </p><p>The average figure for the public sector wage bill in other </p><p>PRGF countries is five to six percent of GDP, according to </p><p>the IMF. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Need for GOH to Develop Plan of Action </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) Garza said that the government clearly sees the </p><p>problem but is finding it difficult to quickly turn around </p><p>the inherited problems.  President Ricardo Maduro announced </p><p>his intentions (on November 13) to push for a Fiscal </p><p>Responsibility Pact with all sectors of society.  The GOH </p><p>intends to show the public the gap between revenues and </p><p>needed expenditures and to engender enough public </p><p>understanding to undertake the needed structural changes. </p><p>The government will be working in the next few months on: 1) </p><p>an assessment of tax policy; 2) a study of current </p><p>expenditures to identify priority areas; 3) a review of the </p><p>subsidy policy, to see where subsidies can be targeted to the </p><p>sectors of society most in need; 4) a review of the financial </p><p>situation of public enterprises, where savings have been </p><p>declining over time; and 5) public sector administrative </p><p>reform.  The IMF mission also recommended that the GOH take a </p><p>fresh look at the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) </p><p>first prepared in 2001 and identify the priority areas of </p><p>public expenditures, given current macroeconomic constraints. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The government believes it can identify necessary </p><p>measures by March or April and would like to restart </p><p>negotiations with the IMF at that time.  This would mean that </p><p>under the best case scenario, it will be June or July before </p><p>Honduras once again has an IMF program.  Until that time, </p><p>many World Bank and IDB loans, grants from some donors, and </p><p>debt relief will be held up.  Garza estimated these add to </p><p>USD 240 million in 2003.  A large amount of this sum is Paris </p><p>Club debt service.  PermRep Cha indicated that the IMF will </p><p>continue to be positive in its communications with the Paris </p><p>Club about its continued work with the GOH.  The IMF does not </p><p>expect creditor countries in the Paris Club to push for </p><p>resumption of debt service payments (only Germany indicated </p><p>that it has been receiving demarches from its capital pushing </p><p>the GOH to pay its Paris Club debt).  On the margins of the </p><p>meeting, the World Bank rep - just back from consultations in </p><p>Washington - noted that while existing projects will continue </p><p>(which includes its Reengineering Government project), new </p><p>lending will be limited to what it considers its Low Case </p><p>scenario. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Is the IMF Being Fair to Maduro? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Garza dodged questions from the G-15 and the press on </p><p>reasons the Fund gave a favorable review of the GOH\'s </p><p>financial performance in September 2001, despite the </p><p>existence of the same problems at that time.  The German </p><p>Ambassador, the Italian Ambassador, the Swedish counselor, </p><p>and the UNDP rep all criticized the Fund\'s stance as unfair </p><p>to the Maduro administration.  They noted that the bulk of </p><p>the growth in the current government expenditures (especially </p><p>the wage bill) occurred during the Flores government, and the </p><p>IMF did not declare the GOH off its program at that time. </p><p>They argued that the IMF\'s position basically punishes the </p><p>wrong people and that the economic difficulties the </p><p>government will soon face because of its lack of an IMF </p><p>program will result in destabilization of this reformist </p><p>government.  Other donors emphasized that the lack of an IMF </p><p>program puts into doubt the utility of a Consultative Group </p><p>meeting currently planned for February 3-4. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In turn, the IMF reps urged the G-15 Ambassadors to </p><p>encourage the GOH to seize the moment and make the necessary </p><p>structural reforms.  The IMF reps noted that the situation is </p><p>not sustainable except in the unlikely circumstance that </p><p>donors are willing to finance the government\'s fiscal deficit </p><p>indefinitely (in addition to needed poverty reduction </p><p>programs).  They stated that they saw genuine commitment on </p><p>behalf of the GOH to make these changes in the context of a </p><p>Fiscal Responsibility Pact, and GOH needs the support of the </p><p>donors to get it done.  This window of opportunity would not </p><p>last very long and may not come again, explained the IMF </p><p>officials.  In response to a question on the IMF\'s </p><p>recommendations on tax policy, Garza noted that the </p><p>discussions with the GOH centered on elimination of sales and </p><p>income tax exemptions and not on increases in tax rates. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) In statements to the press, the IMF mission noted </p><p>that actions by the National Banking and Insurance Commission </p><p>(CNBS) had been satisfactory and that the Central Bank\'s </p><p>policy of gradual depreciation of the lempiras is </p><p>appropriate.  They also mentioned that foreign reserves (four </p><p>and a half months of imports) are adequate. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The IMF\'s approval of the GOH\'s macroeconomic </p><p>performance last year was based on projections on spending </p><p>and tax collection that proved fallacious.  At the end of the </p><p>Flores administration traditional election year overspending </p><p>was only delayed rather than avoided.  To make the 2002 </p><p>budget numbers work, then Finance Minister Gabriela Nunez </p><p>apparently assumed an impractical 20 percent increase in tax </p><p>revenues at the same time the Congress was enacting (and </p><p>Flores was signing) a series of new tax exemptions and </p><p>unfounded spending initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Past inaction on macroeconomic and structural </p><p>reforms has resulted in a stagnant economy and an </p><p>unsustainable central government fiscal deficit.  Post </p><p>believes that the GOH macroeconomic team is committed to </p><p>working toward the necessary changes in fiscal policy. </p><p>However, all of these reforms will require political will on </p><p>the part of a government that has a very slim coalition </p><p>majority in Congress.  High level officials in the Maduro </p><p>government have continually asked the USG and other donors to </p><p>push the IMF for flexibility and to understand what it views </p><p>as political realities. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Except in the area of improved tax administration, </p><p>Post is not sanguine about the GOH\'s commitment and ability </p><p>to push through long-lasting and structural economic reforms. </p><p> Many of the measures that the GOH is only now trying to </p><p>analyze - such as consolidation of ministries, improvement of </p><p>the finances of the public enterprises and the reorientation </p><p>of resources in the education ministry to teaching and away </p><p>from administrative resources - could have been undertaken </p><p>during the past ten months but were not.  By the time this </p><p>government is done with its study and analysis, its finances </p><p>will only be that much further in the hole.  While the Maduro </p><p>government\'s rhetoric is strongly reformist, its actual </p><p>performance to date indicates that it is unwilling to act and </p><p>follow through on unpopular, but necessary, policy </p><p>prescriptions.  Embassy recommends supporting the IMF on its </p><p>push for real fiscal and economic reform in Honduras.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
