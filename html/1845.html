<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001935 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/03/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, NI, WCAR </p><p>SUBJECT: POLICY CHANGE ON WCAR KNOWN AT FOREIGN MINISTRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANDREWS/LANIER E-MAILS 08/03/01 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5(b/d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Acting Polcouns met August 3 with Deputy Director of </p><p>the Second United Nations Division (SUND) at the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Ibrahim, in the absence of Director </p><p>Akinsanya, now in Geneva.  SUND has primary action for the </p><p>WCAR within the Ministry.  Ibrahim said that SUND and the </p><p>Ministry generally were "well aware" of President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>"U-turn" on the WCAR.  Although careful to say that he had </p><p>seen no formal instructions (he had just returned from a </p><p>conference, and did not normally handle WCAR issues), Ibrahim </p><p>said  that Geneva "must" have been told to follow Obasanjo\'s </p><p>policy position.  He also acknowledged that Obasanjo\'s </p><p>decision to substitute UN Ambassador Arthur Mbanefo for the </p><p>GON\'s Geneva representative for the WCAR Prepcom in Geneva </p><p>was "well known" within the Ministry and, he assumed, had </p><p>been communicated to the concerned parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)Ibrahim said that the Ministry was in a state of </p><p>"shock" over Obasanjo\'s decision to jettison support for </p><p>reparations for colonial-era slavery.  "This has been our </p><p>position for ten years," said Ibrahim in a tone of </p><p>considerable disappointment.  "We should not drop it </p><p>overnight."  Ibrahim suggested that the GON would find itself </p><p>"very isolated" within the Africa group on WCAR, and GON </p><p>relations with other African states would be harmed by this </p><p>sudden turn-around.  "This is something we should approach </p><p>gradually," he said.  "We should work with our neighbors," he </p><p>said, to change how Africans dealt with the issue.  But, said </p><p>Ibrahim, "He (Obasanjo) is our President, and he has made his </p><p>decision." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment.  We were not able to confirm the actual </p><p>transmittal of instructions to Geneva on WCAR.  Although </p><p>Ibrahim\'s comments make it clear that the MFA understands </p><p>from basement to roof that Nigeria\'s long-standing position </p><p>has suddenly and drastically changed, USDEL may wish to </p><p>consider an early approach to Ambassador Mbanefo. He is </p><p>frequently in direct contact with President Obasanjo and </p><p>would be the best channel to exploit at this time in order to </p><p>elicit vocal Nigerian support for removal of offensive </p><p>language on all relevant issues.  Early engagement would also </p><p>help forestall any attempt by unreconstructed members of the </p><p>Nigerian delegation to work quietly against the new policy. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
