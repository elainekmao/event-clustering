(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Richard A. </p><p>Albright, for reasons 1.5 (b)(c)(d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary: UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff </p><p>Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ) visited May </p><p>10 the newly refurbished Shaykh Zayid Hospital in </p><p>Baghdad (formerly the Olympic Hospital) which opened </p><p>its doors to the public last week.  The hospital was </p><p>established on the orders of UAE President Shaykh </p><p>Zayid bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, and an advance team of UAE </p><p>military personnel (accompanied by a USLO </p><p>representative) traveled to Baghdad last month to </p><p>conduct a site assessment survey for the hospital </p><p>(reftel).  During his visit, MbZ reportedly toured the </p><p>facility, and spoke with a number of staff and </p><p>patients.  The hospital has two pharmacies, an </p><p>outpatient clinic, several operating rooms, and an </p><p>initial stock of supplies to last at least 60 days. </p><p>MbZ\'s visit was the first such visit by a senior </p><p>Emirati to liberated Iraq and was made possible by the </p><p>superb coordination and support provided by CENTCOM. </p><p>A closely held secret in the planning stages, the </p><p>visit was highlighted in all of the local papers </p><p>today.  The Emiratis have gone to great lengths to </p><p>publicize the generous humanitarian assistance </p><p>provided to the Iraqi people by the UAEG via the UAE </p><p>Red Crescent Authority, the Muhammad bin Rashid </p><p>Charitable Foundation and last, but not least, the UAE </p><p>Armed Forces.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In a May 6 meeting with the Ambassador, MbZ </p><p>solicited her assistance in facilitating a short-fuse </p><p>visit to the recently established Shaykh Zayid </p><p>Hospital in Baghdad (formerly known as the Olympic </p><p>Hospital).  MbZ wanted to visit his troops and see </p><p>first-hand the situation on the ground.  He admitted </p><p>he had been itching to get into Iraq since the </p><p>dramatic fall of Baghdad on April 9.  The UAE Armed </p><p>Forces were one of the first Arab/GCC military outfits </p><p>to enter Iraq, when GHQ officers accompanied a UAE Red </p><p>Crescent Authority vessel to Umm Qasr.  The Ambassador </p><p>directed the Embassy\'s USLO office to coordinate MbZ\'s </p><p>visit with CENTCOM.  CENTCOM did a spectacular job </p><p>facilitating the visit and provided security for MbZ </p><p>and his entourage during their two-and-a-half hours on </p><p>the ground in Baghdad.  The Embassy\'s Acting USLO </p><p>Chief accompanied the Emirati delegation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) During his tour of the hospital, MbZ was </p><p>briefed that the hospital receives approximately 1,000 </p><p>new patients every day.  Recent press reports indicate </p><p>that Iraqis from areas outside of Baghdad are </p><p>traveling to the hospital for medical treatment. </p><p>Acting USLO Chief personally witnessed a queue of </p><p>Iraqis seeking medical treatment leading outside of </p><p>the hospital and down the street; it is clear that the </p><p>hospital\'s staff is overwhelmed, but coping. </p><p>Following his visit to the hospital, MbZ dropped by </p><p>the Rashid Hotel where the UAE hospital staff are </p><p>billeted, and the UAE Embassy in Baghdad to meet with </p><p>the staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: The short visit to Baghdad was a win- </p><p>win for everyone involved -- the UAE leadership saw </p><p>firsthand the hospital\'s operations and facilities, </p><p>and recognized the essential roles played by both </p><p>CENTCOM and the Embassy in facilitating the delivery </p><p>and set-up of this hospital.  On the return trip, </p><p>MbZ\'s staff requested USG assistance in evacuating </p><p>wounded Iraqis who require specialized medical care </p><p>not available in Iraq.  We currently are coordinating </p><p>with the UAE Red Crescent to evacuate 37 injured </p><p>Iraqis (mostly children) to the UAE.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
