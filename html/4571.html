<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008778 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/02/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: EU AMBIVALENCE, CYPRUS SEEN AS OBSTACLES TO </p><p>TURKEY\'S EU CANDIDACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8586 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Poloff discussed the state of Turkey\'s EU candidacy </p><p>with several Ankara-based European diplomats following a </p><p>November 26 meeting with Ambassador in which an unusually </p><p>downbeat PM Gul appeared to believe Turkey had recently lost </p><p>ground in its EU membership bid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>EU Ambivalence </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A Danish diplomat suggested that GOT officials may be </p><p>learning the extent of EU ambivalence about Turkey\'s </p><p>candidacy for the first time as a result of ruling AK Party </p><p>leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan\'s tour of EU capitals.  He said </p><p>the highly positive press coverage of the tour was </p><p>misleading; leaders in countries such as Finland and Portugal </p><p>had made supportive public comments, but in private had told </p><p>Erdogan only that they favored setting a date for considering </p><p>when accession talks for Turkey might begin (a "date for a </p><p>date") rather than setting a concrete date at the December </p><p>12-13 EU Summit.  Before Erdogan\'s visit, many EU members had </p><p>avoided spelling out their position on Turkey\'s candidacy, </p><p>and GOT officials may have assumed they had more support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Cyprus </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) UK, German, Swedish, Dutch, and Greek diplomats said </p><p>they did not/not believe Turkey had recently lost support in </p><p>their capitals.  Some suggested GOT frustration could be </p><p>Cyprus related.  Shortly after the November 3 election </p><p>Erdogan accepted the tacit linkage between progress on Cyprus </p><p>and EU membership, and made several optimistic statements on </p><p>Cyprus.  More recently, Erdogan has tried to separate the two </p><p>issues and downplay hopes for a quick Cyprus agreement.  The </p><p>diplomats speculated that leaders of the new GOT now realize </p><p>how difficult it will be to achieve a pre-Summit breakthrough </p><p>on Cyprus, and, as a result, may have lowered expectations </p><p>for the EU Summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Reform Package May Come Too Late </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The diplomats agreed the GOT\'s new legislative reform </p><p>package (reftel), not yet introduced in Parliament, appeared </p><p>to include significant human rights measures.  However, they </p><p>said, the package may come too late to affect EU thinking on </p><p>Turkey.  DPM Yalcinbayir has said the new legislation will </p><p>not be passed before the Summit.  In any case, the diplomats </p><p>said, EU capitals need time to grasp the significance of </p><p>legal reform in Turkey.  The diplomats recalled that it took </p><p>most EU member states a couple of months to acknowledge the </p><p>GOT\'s August reform package and adjust their views on </p><p>Turkey\'s candidacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
