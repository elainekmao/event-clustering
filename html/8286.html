<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001497 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, PGOV, CA, Narcotics </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: GOVERNMENT INTRODUCES LEGISLATIVE CHANGES </p><p>TO ITS CONTROLLED DRUGS AND SUBSTANCES ACT - THE CANNABIS </p><p>REFORM BILL </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  On May 27, Canada\'s Minister of Health Anne </p><p>McLellan, Minister of Justice Martin Cauchon, and Solicitor </p><p>General Wayne Easter presented to the House of Commons the </p><p>long-awaited legislative reforms to Canada\'s Controlled Drugs </p><p>and Substances Act pertaining to marijuana. Debate in the </p><p>House will now take place and, according to Minister Cauchon, </p><p>the Government hopes the new law will be in place by the end </p><p>of the year.  The legislative changes are part of what </p><p>Minister McLellan said  is a renewed National Drug Strategy </p><p>that,the GoC hopes, will decrease the use of harmful drugs, </p><p>decrease the supply of illicit drugs, modernize and promote </p><p>anti-drug laws (including adjusting penalties), and promote </p><p>healthy decision-making, especially among younger Canadians. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>The Proposed Marijuana legislation </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Government of Canada, spearheaded by the Ministers of </p><p>Health and Justice and the Solicitor General, introduced the </p><p>Cannabis Reform Bill (C-38) to the House of Commons on May </p><p>27.  According to the GoC\'s press release, this bill, if </p><p>enacted, would replace the current criminal court process and </p><p>resulting criminal penalties with alternative penalties for </p><p>possession of 15 grams or less of marijuana or one gram or </p><p>less of cannabis resin (hashish); would provide law </p><p>enforcement officers the discretion to give a ticket or issue </p><p>a summons to appear in criminal court for possession of </p><p>between 15 and 30 grams of marijuana; would provide for </p><p>greater alternative penalties when aggravating factors are </p><p>present (including possession while committing an indictable </p><p>offense such as operating a motor vehicle or while on or near </p><p>school grounds); and would create new offenses and provide </p><p>for tougher penalties for illegal growers.  Specifically, the </p><p>proposed bill would set penalties for the possession of </p><p>marijuana as: </p><p> </p><p>-- possession of 15 grams or less of marijuana - fine of USD </p><p>100 (youth USD 70) </p><p> </p><p>-- possession of one gram or less of cannabis resin - fine of </p><p>USD 200 (youth USD 130) </p><p> </p><p>-- possession of 15 to 30 grams of marijuana - fine of USD </p><p>200 (youth USD 130). </p><p> </p><p>3. For possession of 15 to 30 grams, the police officer </p><p>present would retain the ability to determine if the offender </p><p>should receive a ticket or be issued a summons for a summary </p><p>conviction. If a summary conviction is determined, the </p><p>penalty for possession would be up to six months in prison </p><p>and/or up to about USD 700 in fines.   Moreover, if an </p><p>individual is caught in possession of marijuana while he/she </p><p>is operating a motor vehicle or while near a school,  or if </p><p>there are other aggravating factors, the fines could be </p><p>increased to about USD 300 for an adult and USD 175 for a </p><p>youth under 18.  And, if an offender is under 18 years of </p><p>age, his/her parent/guardian would receive a written notice </p><p>of the child\'s infraction. </p><p> </p><p>4. By decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of </p><p>marijuana, the GoC claims that it will be able to focus more </p><p>law enforcement resources on combating commercial marijuana </p><p>growers and traffickers, including those associated with </p><p>organized criminal groups.  In his announcement, Minister of </p><p>Justice Cauchon said the new legislation would increase </p><p>penalties for commercial growers.  For instance, individuals </p><p>caught growing between 1 and 3 plants could face up to 12 </p><p>months in jail plus fines up to USD 3500, growers of between </p><p>4 and 25 plants could get up to 18 months in jail and fines </p><p>up to USD 16,500, growers of 26 to 50 plants could face 10 </p><p>years and growers of over 50 plants could get 14 years in </p><p>prison. In addition, in cases involving the growing of more </p><p>than three plants, a judge would have to provide reason why </p><p>imprisonment was not imposed where any of the following </p><p>aggravating factors was found: </p><p> </p><p>-- a risk of danger for children in the building where the </p><p>operation exists; </p><p> </p><p>-- use of traps (set to protect the premises from intruders </p><p>or police); </p><p> </p><p>-- use of explosives (booby traps or to destroy evidence); </p><p> </p><p>-- use of land belonging to others (farm land); and </p><p> </p><p>-- operation creating a safety hazard in a residential area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>According to Cauchon, the GoC is proposing no changes to the </p><p>penalties for those individuals convicted of narcotics </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Though Minister of Health McLellan stated in her public </p><p>announcement that the GoC recognizes that its move to </p><p>decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana </p><p>would likely result in an immediate increase in the number of </p><p>users, she believed this would be a temporary response by the </p><p>public and not a long-lasting trend.  McLellan stated that </p><p>the proposed decriminalization of marijuana was part of a </p><p>renewal of Canada\'s National Drug Strategy and pledged a new </p><p>5-year-USD160 million budget to decrease the use of harmful </p><p>drugs; decrease the supply of illicit drugs, modernize and </p><p>promote anti-drug laws (including adjusting penalties), and </p><p>promote healthy decision-making, especially among younger </p><p>Canadians. </p><p> </p><p>6.  For his part, Canada\'s Solicitor General Wayne Easter </p><p>stated that the renewed National Drug Strategy would devote </p><p>additional resources to Canada\'s drug awareness program and </p><p>would give Canada\'s law enforcement increased tools with </p><p>which to fight Canada\'s drug war.  For instance, Easter </p><p>stated that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) would </p><p>receive more resources for their efforts to identify and </p><p>dismantle indoor marijuana grow operations and precursor </p><p>chemical laboratories , money to teach police how to identify </p><p>individuals who drive while impaired, money for substance </p><p>abuse treatment programs in Canada\'s penal institutions, and </p><p>funds to establish a coordination subgroup within the </p><p>Solicitor General\'s office. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Comment: Though the GoC is quick to stress that the </p><p>introduction of C-38 is in accordance with the will of the </p><p>Canadian people, some MPs, including members of the majority </p><p>Liberal Party, have already expressed concern about the bill. </p><p> According to Liberal MP Dan McTeague, (quote) it is clear </p><p>that there are problems (with C-38) and that some 20 or more </p><p>other Liberal MPs are opposed (unquote).  Not surprisingly </p><p>other MPs, for instance Libby Davis, NDP and Greg Thompson </p><p>PC, say C-38 is (quote) out of the twilight zone and is not </p><p>well thought out (unquote).  Some Parliament watchers suspect </p><p>(or hope) that if the Prime Minister allows his party to vote </p><p>their consciences, the bill -- as it now is written -- may </p><p>not find its way out of debate before the winter recess - </p><p>thereby effectively killing it. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
