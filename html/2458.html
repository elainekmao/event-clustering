(C) FIDES, A VATICAN NEWS AGENCY, IS SET TO LAUNCH A </p><p>LENTEN APPEAL NEXT WEEK FOR THE FREEDOM OF MISSING OR </p><p>DETAINED UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC CLERGY.  FATHER BERNARDO </p><p>CERVELLERA, FIDES DIRECTOR AND CHINA SPECIALIST, PROVIDED </p><p>AMBASSADOR AN ADVANCE LIST OF MORE THAN 30 NAMES IN ORDER TO </p><p>FOREWARN THE WHITE HOUSE BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO </p><p>CHINA.  THE APPEAL WILL COMPRISE SOME 40 CLERGYMEN IN TOTAL, </p><p>WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL CLERIC LINKED TO A DAY OF LENT.  (LENT </p><p>BEGINS FEBRUARY 13 AND LASTS 40 DAYS.)  THE LIST (SEE PARA 5) </p><p>CONSISTS OF UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC BISHOPS AND PRIESTS WHO ARE </p><p>PERSECUTED BY PRC AUTHORITIES ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR REFUSAL TO </p><p>COLLABORATE WITH THE OFFICIAL "CATHOLIC PATRIOTIC </p><p>ASSOCIATION."  THOUGH NOT SEEKING TO EMBARRASS THE PRESIDENT </p><p>DURING THE CHINA VISIT, FIDES WILL LIKELY CAPITALIZE ON MEDIA </p><p>ATTENTION IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT ISSUES OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>IN CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) FATHER CERVELLERA ASSERTED THAT HIS VATICAN SUPERIORS </p><p>HAVE APPROVED THIS LENTEN PRAYER INITIATIVE ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>UNDERGROUND CHURCH. HE CLAIMED THE PERSONAL ENDORSEMENT OF </p><p>CARDINAL SEPE, THE HEAD OF DE PROPAGANDE FIDE, A.K.A. THE </p><p>CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLES, WHICH ALSO </p><p>OVERSEES THE FIDES NEWS SERVICE.  (NOTE: DE PROPAGANDE FIDE </p><p>IS THE VATICAN MINISTRY CHARGED WITH THE SPREAD OF </p><p>CATHOLICISM AND THE WELFARE OF FRONTIER CHURCH COMMUNITIES, </p><p>SUCH AS IN CHINA.)  CERVELLERA ADDED HE IS ANGLING FOR A </p><p>PAPAL STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR THE FIDES INITIATIVE, PERHAPS </p><p>DURING THE POPE\'S WEEKLY STATEMENT AT THE SUNDAY ANGELUS </p><p>PRAYER.  HOWEVER, NO PAPAL INTERVENTION IS PLANNED AT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00579  01 OF 03  061054Z </p><p>PRESENT, HE ADMITTED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT:  FATHER CERVELLERA IS SEEKING TO LINK THE </p><p>FIDES INITIATIVE TO THE FORTY DAYS OF LENT. HENCE, THE </p><p>EFFORT, STILL INCOMPLETE, TO MUSTER FORTY NAMES.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S VISIT, WHICH FALLS IN THE FIRST WEEK OF LENT, </p><p>IS CLEARLY IN THE FOREGROUND OF CERVELLERA\'S THINKING, EVERY </p><p>BIT AS MUCH AS THE LITURGICAL CALENDAR.  CERVELLERA CONFIDED </p><p>TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE PERSONALLY GIVES GREAT CREDIT TO </p><p>THE INTERVENTION OF PRESIDENT BUSH FOR THE REDUCED SENTENCE </p><p>-- TWO YEARS RATHER THAN THE DEATH PENALTY -- METED OUT TO A </p><p>CHINESE CONVICTED OF ILLICIT TRAFFICKING (IN BIBLES). </p><p>MOREOVER, HE NOTED GRATEFULLY THE HUMAN RIGHTS APPEAL BY </p><p>AMBASSADOR RANDT IN BEIJING ON BEHALF OF BISHOP SU, AS WELL </p><p>AS OTHER NON-CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS LEADERS. CLEARLY, FATHER </p><p>CERVELLERA WOULD WELCOME A USG ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE PLIGHT </p><p>OF UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC CLERGY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) BACKGROUND:  FATHER CERVELLERA IS A COMMITTED VATICAN </p><p>ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC CHURCH.
