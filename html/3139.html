<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003227 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR A/S QUARLES, DAS RADELET, MICHAEL KAPLAN </p><p>DEPT FOR E, NEA, EB </p><p>NSC FOR CLAY LOWERY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN FINANCE MINISTRY OFFICIAL ON DEBT AIMS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM GREGORY L. BERRY.  REASONS 1.5 B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  In a June 16 meeting with Econ chief, Dr. Muhammad </p><p>Abu Hammour, Secretary General of the Finance Ministry (the </p><p>number two ministry official and the senior such official </p><p>currently in town), said meetings in European capitals were </p><p>"going well" regarding Jordan\'s request for a stock of debt </p><p>treatment by the Paris Club next month.  He said that Finance </p><p>Minister Marto had told him that the Germans and British were </p><p>"on the right track," but he was unable to provide additional </p><p>details of Marto\'s meetings.  In addition to Marto\'s </p><p>meetings, Abu Hammour said Prime Minister Abu Ragheb would be </p><p>discussing the request in Madrid and Brussels over the next </p><p>few days.  (He did not mention Planning Minister Awadallah\'s </p><p>meetings last week in Washington.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  The most important upcoming meeting would, Abu </p><p>Hammour said, be King Abdullah\'s visit to Tokyo at the end of </p><p>the month.  He said that as the largest creditor, Japan\'s </p><p>support for "extraordinary treatment" from the Paris Club was </p><p>essential.  He felt that recent indications by Japanese </p><p>officials of a willingness to include post-cutoff date claims </p><p>in a traditional two-year consolidation period were </p><p>reassuring.  He thought that Japan could go further under </p><p>sufficient pressure to maintain a multilateral Paris Club </p><p>consensus. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Abu Hammour did not answer directly when asked if he </p><p>thought there was any possibility that Japan would consider </p><p>measures outside the Paris Club.  He thought that this would </p><p>be consistent with the unilateral U.S. debt forgiveness and </p><p>large debt swap programs provided by European creditors. </p><p>However, he said that in his recent meetings in Tokyo with </p><p>Foreign Minister Muasher, senior Japanese officials had </p><p>emphasized Japan\'s economic problems as reasons why it was </p><p>difficult for Japan to do more for Jordan (beyond $20 </p><p>million/year in non-project grant aid).  They also told Abu </p><p>Hammour that Jordan\'s $3 billion in official reserves (8 </p><p>months of imports) showed that Jordan did not need extra </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c) In support of Jordan\'s ongoing need for balance of </p><p>payments relief, Abu Hammour said he argued that 1) reserves </p><p>would decline as a share of imports under the IMF program, 2) </p><p>Jordan had still to feel the full impact on its exports of </p><p>the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, 3) UN Compensation </p><p>Fund transfers that amounted to over $500 million in 2000 had </p><p>come to an end, 4) Jordan faced over $800 million per year in </p><p>debt service, and 5) that the new economic investment program </p><p>(PSET) would raise import requirements for the next several </p><p>years.  He thought it ironic that given above market interest </p><p>rates on Jordan\'s current debt to Japan, Jordan was </p><p>effectively helping finance the Japanese economy. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Comment:  Abu Hammour\'s comments indicated that the </p><p>Jordanians have clearly heard the message that a </p><p>"Pakistan-style" stock treatment was more than creditors, </p><p>including the United States, were prepared to provide. </p><p>Nonetheless, he said this would remain Jordan\'s formal </p><p>request to the Paris Club -- given that it had been enshrined </p><p>in King Abdullah\'s recent letters to the Japanese and German </p><p>Prime Ministers.  Abu Hammour stressed four basic themes </p><p>driving Jordan\'s debt objectives:  1) That Jordan faced </p><p>persistent large balance of payments funding gaps for the </p><p>next ten years, 2) that Jordan had implemented major policy </p><p>reforms under 12 years of IMF tutelage and that there was no </p><p>need for more IMF programs to encourage more policy reforms, </p><p>3) that Jordan\'s goal was thus to end the cycle of Paris Club </p><p>and IMF programs, and 4) that high interest rates on pre- and </p><p>post-cutoff date commercial and development aid debt to Japan </p><p>were the core of Jordan\'s ongoing debt servicing problem. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
