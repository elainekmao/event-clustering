<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002340 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, EU, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: EU SUMMIT DOCUMENTARY ANGERS TURKS AND GERMANS, </p><p>EMBARRASSES DANES </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: A Danish documentary on the December 2002 EU </p><p>Summit has angered Turks and Germans and embarrassed Denmark. </p><p> The documentary, covered in the Turkish press, features </p><p>candid comments by Danish and German ministers critical of </p><p>Turkey\'s EU bid.  The German Embassy has criticized the </p><p>documentary; our MFA contact was philosophical.  A Danish </p><p>diplomat said his government was "naive" in releasing the </p><p>controversial footage.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Turkish Press Highlights Controversy </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Turkish press April 8 and 9 began running stories </p><p>about a Danish documentary of the December 2002 EU Summit in </p><p>Copenhagen, which has been broadcast on Swedish and Danish </p><p>television.  The coverage has focused on candid comments by </p><p>Danish and German leaders critical of Turkey.  Reported </p><p>highlights include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Danish FM Moller says German officials are supporting </p><p>Turkey\'s EU candidacy in public, but not in private.  He says </p><p>German FM Fischer changed his mind on Turkey three times in </p><p>12 hours.  At one point, he says, Fischer made it clear he </p><p>does not want Turkey in the EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Danish PM Rasmussen says no EU countries supported Turkey </p><p>"at the table," and predicts that Turkey\'s opponents will </p><p>find a pretext to delay Turkey\'s accession when its candidacy </p><p>is reviewed in December 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- PM Rasmussen notes that President Bush has called him </p><p>several times to lobby on Turkey\'s behalf, but claims, "I did </p><p>not accept his demands.  We cannot abide by the demands of </p><p>everybody." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Germans Furious at "Naive" Danes, MFA Calm </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A deeply frustrated Danish diplomat confirmed to us </p><p>the substance of the reports.  He said the Germans are </p><p>"furious" at the Danes; by noon April 9 the German Embassy </p><p>had called him three times to complain.  German Ambassador </p><p>Schmidt publicly denounced the documentary and said Germany </p><p>believes Turkey\'s EU accession drive should continue in </p><p>parallel with political reforms.  Ayse Sezgin, head of the </p><p>MFA Deputy Directorate General for EU Department, told us the </p><p>documentary will provide ammunition to EU-sceptics in Turkey, </p><p>but ultimately will not affect Turkey\'s candidacy.  Sezgin </p><p>averred that official decisions count more than private </p><p>comments, and since the Summit both the EU and Turkey have </p><p>continued on course.  This is not the first such EU </p><p>controversy -- for example, Turkey-based EU representative </p><p>Karen Fogg (since departed) and former French President </p><p>Valery Giscard d\'Estaing have made controversial statements </p><p>about Turkey.  As in the past, she argued, Turkey would stick </p><p>to its program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Danish diplomat said his Government, in a </p><p>classically Scandinavian spirit of openness, agreed to give a </p><p>documentary film crew total access to internal Summit </p><p>discussions, on the condition that the Government would have </p><p>a chance to edit the material before release.  Unfortunately, </p><p>he said, the Foreign Ministry was not involved in the </p><p>editing.  Those making the decisions on what to cut were only </p><p>considering domestic public opinion.  Denmark is a small </p><p>country not used to being taken seriously, yet suddenly it </p><p>found itself running an important Summit as term president. </p><p>Danish officials were eager to show their leaders working </p><p>with Germans on an equal basis and putting the Americans in </p><p>their place.  They were "naive" and never considered the </p><p>fallout in Germany and Turkey, he said.  Furthermore, he </p><p>averred, the documentary is misleading in that it casts </p><p>Germany as the villain from the GOT perspective, while </p><p>France, the real obstacle for Turkey, gets off scot free. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Groucho Marx once defined comedy as someone else\'s </p><p>grandmother rolling down the hill in a wheelchair, and we </p><p>take this minor fiasco in that spirit.  But this documentary </p><p>will feed Turkish paranoia.  Turks are masters at creating </p><p>conspiracy theories out of thin air; now they have real </p><p>evidence to embellish and build upon. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
