<p>UNCLAS ISTANBUL 000467 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL WORRIES ABOUT WAR, U.S.-TURKEY TIES, </p><p>ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: With apparently over ninety percent of the </p><p>local population opposed to the war in Iraq, anti-war </p><p>sentiment in Istanbul continues to harden as reports and </p><p>images of civilian casualties stream in over the sympathetic </p><p>news networks.  Among Istanbul\'s academic and business elite, </p><p>however, fears of a breakdown in U.S.-Turkish relations and </p><p>its consequences for Turkey have replaced Iraq as the primary </p><p>concern.  The only issue that seems to span the sharp divide </p><p>between the concerns of the man in the street and the elite </p><p>is a shared nervousness about the government\'s ability to </p><p>manage an already-battered economy in the face of additional </p><p>shocks from the war.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Media coverage of the coalition operations in Iraq has </p><p>largely reinforced the prevailing anti-war sentiment in </p><p>Istanbul.  Local television stations have focused </p><p>predominantly on civilian casualties, reports of coalition </p><p>setbacks, and regional opposition to the war.  Although our </p><p>contacts with average Turks have elicited responses ranging </p><p>from apathy to antipathy, the general mood among </p><p>working-class (and unemployed) Istanbul residents remains </p><p>decidedly anti-war.  Pointing to the coalition\'s failure to </p><p>find evidence of chemical and biological weapons, almost all </p><p>Turks here question the U.S.\'s justification for war. </p><p>Students stubbornly cling to their mantra of "no blood for </p><p>oil," while residents of more conservative and religious </p><p>neighborhoods voice their concerns about an "anti-Muslim </p><p>crusade."  Although very few have a kind word to say about </p><p>Saddam and his regime, they point gloomily to the </p><p>difficulties involved in managing a post-Saddam Iraq and the </p><p>regional resentment that is being provoked by the U.S.\'s </p><p>presence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The preoccupations of our business, academic and media </p><p>contacts, however, have shifted dramatically in recent days. </p><p>Following weeks of negotiations and the parliament\'s refusal </p><p>to allow the U.S. to transport troops and equipment to </p><p>northern Iraq, the Istanbul elite is now focused on the </p><p>"crisis" in U.S.-Turkish relations.  Discussions of "what </p><p>went wrong?", "who is to blame?", and "is the strategic </p><p>partnership dead?" have replaced arguments over whether the </p><p>war in Iraq is justified.  At an April 2 Marmara Group </p><p>conference on U.S.-Turkish relations, a panel of retired </p><p>generals, senior diplomats, and business leaders skirted the </p><p>case for war, but came out strongly in favor of maintaining </p><p>the strategic partnership.  Former Foreign Minister Emre </p><p>Gonensay argued that, given its friendship with the U.S., </p><p>Turkey should have stood by the U.S. in Iraq.  Echoing the </p><p>comments of other panelists, retired General Necdet Timur </p><p>remarked that two months of disagreement cannot be allowed to </p><p>undermine a 50-year old strategic relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The only unifying theme in our discussions throughout </p><p>Istanbul has been the universal, even overriding, concern </p><p>about the fragile economic situation.  "Turkey must solve its </p><p>economic problems... without a healthy economy, foreign </p><p>policy is irrelevant," said former diplomat and DYP Vice </p><p>Chairman Mehmet Ali Bayar at the Marmara Group conference. </p><p>Investment analysts, bankers, and economists are skeptical </p><p>about the AK government\'s ability to implement the IMF </p><p>program.  Many of them now argue that the risk of loan </p><p>default or restructuring has risen.  Sentiment has improved </p><p>in the wake of Secretary Powell\'s visit and the renewed </p><p>prospect for U.S. assistance, but all eyes are on AK\'s </p><p>economic efforts.  Almost everyone worries about the </p><p>potentially damaging impact that the war in Iraq is likely to </p><p>have on Turkey\'s economy.  Local merchants and restaurant </p><p>owners claim they are already feeling the pinch of </p><p>contracting tourism.  Grocers, taxi drivers, security guards, </p><p>and other working-class Turks in Istanbul bemoan their </p><p>economic plight and hope for a rapid conclusion to the war. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
