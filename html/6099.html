<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ACCRA 000447 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, GH, taxes </p><p>SUBJECT: WAGES AND TAXES:  WEEK\'S EVENTS SET STAGE FOR </p><p>TENSION ON WAGES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: EconChief F.Day for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The government is in a very difficult </p><p>position with its ongoing wage negotiations with government </p><p>employees. Its new agreement with the IMF caps the wage bill </p><p>at a 22 percent increase, but it has accepted a 28.6 percent </p><p>increase in the minimum wage.  Holding the average increase </p><p>to 22 percent is going to be difficult, particularly as </p><p>public employees are expecting generous raises to compensate </p><p>for the doubling of petrol prices last January.  Ghana\'s HIPC </p><p>program will be endangered, however, if the GoG does not </p><p>succeed in holding the line on its wage bill.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Wage negotiations in Ghana typically begin with </p><p>agreement on a new minimum wage.  The rate of increase in </p><p>that wage becomes the benchmark for the rest of the public </p><p>sector, which in turn influences the private sector.  After </p><p>an abortive attempt by the GoG to unilaterally move the </p><p>minimum wage up 26 percent to 9,000 cedis per day ($1.05), </p><p>government, employers and the unions have agreed to 9,200 </p><p>cedis.  This is quite a bit less than the 12,000 cedis unions </p><p>had been demanding, and it is not clear that the rank and </p><p>file will accept it. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Negotiations on public sector pay above the minimum </p><p>rate have not begun, but Finance Minister Osafo-Maafo\'s </p><p>presentation to Parliament February 27 clarified the fiscal </p><p>constraints within which they will be conducted.  He </p><p>announced many measures to enhance revenue, among them a 7 </p><p>1/2 percent "national reconstruction levy" on banks that was </p><p>to lapse but which will be continued, a 5 percent levy on </p><p>re-exported goods, the abolition of non-government lotteries </p><p>to give the government lottery a monopoly, direct taxation of </p><p>tro-tro drivers, etc.  Many observers were surprised by the </p><p>absence of an increase in the VAT; we had been told by a </p><p>senior minister it would go up 5 percent.  In fact, </p><p>Osafo-Maafo did announce a 2 1/2 percent increase, but buried </p><p>it in the speech so deftly (under the National Health </p><p>Insurance Scheme)that not even trained economic analysts </p><p>caught the fleeting mention of an increase in levies on </p><p>"expenditures and transactions," i.e., the VAT.  We were </p><p>alerted by an official who knew where in the speech it had </p><p>been inserted. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Minister also announced increases in two taxes on </p><p>petrol:  the road maintenance levy and the debt recovery </p><p>levy; together, these will raise prices at the pump by more </p><p>than 10 percent on top of January\'s near doubling of the </p><p>price. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Protectionist tariffs on rice and frozen chicken were </p><p>also added to the package at the last minute, four days </p><p>before the speech.  According to a source at the central </p><p>bank, practically no one knew these were coming.  The IMF is </p><p>said to be upset with these tariffs for a number of reasons: </p><p>it didn\'t like being blindsided, the reversion to </p><p>protectionism seems regressive, and the last minute nature of </p><p>the decision raises governance issues. Particularly so, in </p><p>the view of our central bank source, as the chicken tariff is </p><p>nearly certainly the work of Kwabena Darko, a wealthy and </p><p>very well connected chicken farmer (comment:  we concur in </p><p>this assessment).  These tariffs will raise the cost of </p><p>living for ordinary Ghanaians. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The IMF agreement limits the GoG\'s ability to offer </p><p>more in salary increases than can be afforded with these new </p><p>revenue measures but without increased borrowing. The </p><p>mutually agreed upon limit is 22 percent.  Since the increase </p><p>at the bottom end of the scale was nearly 29 percent, other </p><p>workers will be asked to settle for somewhat under 20 </p><p>percent.  Workers certainly do not know this yet, and labor </p><p>negotiators trying to boost the minimum wage increase did not </p><p>realize (or perhaps accept) the zero sum nature of what they </p><p>were doing. The more successful they were, the less other </p><p>workers might get later. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Comment:  We may be entering a contentious period. </p><p>There is unsettled business left over from the petroleum </p><p>increases; people are expecting pay raises.  Given Ghana\'s </p><p>current situation, unrealistic expectations may run into </p><p>unpleasant reality--the government simply cannot afford more. </p><p> Furthermore, a number of provincial officials we have spoken </p><p>to recently have termed a VAT increase on the heels of the </p><p>petrol hikes "political suicide," but fiscal exigencies left </p><p>the GoG no real choice. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Comment Continued. While no one noticed the VAT </p><p>increase in Osafo-Maafo\'s address, people will notice it in </p><p>their pockets (store clerks will receive instructions on </p><p>collecting it), and may be even more annoyed at the seemingly </p><p>non-transparent manner in which it came about. They may also </p><p>notice the smallish bump in gas prices. Additionally, </p><p>electricity and water rates were scheduled to go up March </p><p>1st. The stakes are high; ng the line on government borrowing </p><p>is a firm IMF condition on renewal of Ghana\'s HIPC program. </p><p>However, we note a near non-reaction to the doubling of fuel </p><p>prices save two modest labor marches and the usual radio talk </p><p>show froth. The agreement on the minimum wage has also seen </p><p>little protest. Fiscal discipline must balance with domestic </p><p>political concerns--so far the government is keeping its </p><p>balance. End Comment. </p><p>PERGL </p><p></p></div>
