<p>UNCLAS IZMIR 0373 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: IZMIR 335 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, BEXP, TU, LY </p><p>SUBJECT: LIBYANS RETURN TO IZMIR; THEY ARE WELCOME AS LONG AS </p><p>THEY BRING DOLLARS </p><p> </p><p>1. UNLIKE THE FIRST LIBYAN SHIP TO VISIT IZMIR AFTER A LONG HIATUS, </p><p>WHICH ARRIVED WITHOUT FANFARE, (REFTEL), THE SECOND SHIP ARRIVED TO </p><p>AN OFFICIAL GREETING BY THE MAYOR OF KONAK, AND REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>OF SEVERAL MERCHANT\'S ASSOCIATIONS. THE DEBARKING PASSENGERS WERE </p><p>MET BY THE MUNICIPALITY BAND AND LOCAL OFFICIALS WITH WELCOMING </p><p>GIFTS. MAYOR SARISIN NOTED IN HIS REMARKS THAT AFTER SUCESSFUL </p><p>MEETING WITH THE LIBYAN AMBASSADOR IN ANKARA, AN AGREEMENT WAS </p><p>REACHED FOR REGULAR LIBYAN FERRY VISITS TO IZMIR WITH A GOAL OF ONE </p><p>SHIP A WEEK AND A PASSENGER TOTAL OF ALMOST TWO THOUSAND EACH </p><p>MONTH. LOCAL OFFICIALS OPTIMISTICALLY HOPE THAT THE LIBYAN </p><p>TOURISTS WILL LEAVE IZMIR MERCHANTS RICHER TO THE TUNE OF $50 </p><p>MILLION EACH MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE RESUMPTION OF THE LIBYAN FERRY SERVICE TO IZMIR IS WELCOMED </p><p>BY MANY IZMIR MERCHANTS, MANY OF WHOM FIND BUSINESS SLOW, PARTLY </p><p>DUE TO THE SLOW TOURIST SEASON. THESE LIBYAN FERRIES BRING </p><p>SHOPPING TOURISTS WHO COME TO BUY EVERYTHING FROM STAPLES LIKE RICE </p><p>AND FLOUR IN BULK, TO HOUSEHOLD ITEMS, CLOTHES AND LARGE </p><p>APPLIANCES. THEY ALSO BRING THEIR CARS, OFTEN PUSHING THEM OFF </p><p>THE FERRY FOR NEEDED REPAIRS. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY LOCAL </p><p>DENTISTS AND DOCTORS HAVE AN ACTIVE PRACTICE CATERING TO THESE </p><p>LIBYAN TOURISTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. COMMENT: WHILE THE EXPECTATIONS OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM </p><p>THESE LIBYAN SHOPPING TOURS ARE SOMEWHAT INFLATED, THEIR PRESENCE </p><p>IS WELCOMED BY LOCAL MERCHANTS, ESPECIALLY DURING A SUMMER SEASON </p><p>WHEN MANY RESIDENTS OF IZMIR PLAN VACATIONS INSTEAD OF PURCHASES, </p><p>AND LEAVE FOR THEIR SUMMER QUARTERS ALONG THE SEA.  WITH FEW </p><p>TOURISTS THIS YEAR, LIBYAN DOLLARS ARE DOUBLY WELCOME. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ZAJAC </p><p></p><p></p></div>
