CROCKER; REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) HAFIZ AL-ASAD\'S EFFORT TO PREPARE SON BASHAR TO </p><p>ASSUME EVENTUALLY THE PRESIDENCY IS INCREASINGLY THE </p><p>PRISM THROUGH WHICH POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE VIEWED </p><p>AND INTERPRETED.  THE PROSPECTS FOR A SMOOTH </p><p>SUCCESSION ARE A DIRECT FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH TIME ASAD </p><p>HAS -- AND HOW MUCH APTITUDE BASHAR SHOWS.  GIVEN HIS </p><p>AGE AND HEALTH, PRESIDENT ASAD COULD DIE AT ANY TIME; </p><p>HIS EARLY DEPARTURE WOULD LIKELY REVIVE THE LONG- </p><p>DORMANT STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN SYRIA.  ELDEST SON </p><p>BASHAR IS FAR FROM A SURE BET TO FOLLOW IN HIS </p><p>FATHER\'S FOOTSTEPS, AND, IN ANY CASE, WOULD NEVER </p><p>ENJOY HIS FATHER\'S ABSOLUTE GRIP ON POWER.  VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT KHADDAM WOULD LIKELY HAVE A KEY ROLE IN </p><p>SUCCESSION.  ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, MULTIPLE POWER </p><p>CENTERS ARE LIKELY TO EMERGE.  AS THE INTERNAL POWER </p><p>STRUGGLE DEVELOPS, THE SYRIAN LEADERSHIP\'S PRIMARY </p><p>FOCUS WILL BE ON CONSOLIDATING POWER.  WHILE THE </p><p>STRUGGLE WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE VIOLENT, THE </p><p>TRANSITION FROM ASAD\'S RULE COULD HAVE NEGATIVE </p><p>RAMIFICATIONS FOR U.S. INTERESTS IN A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>REGIONAL PEACE, WMD, COUNTER-TERRORISM AND IRAQ.  ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, THE U.S. COULD FIND SOME OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>TO ADVANCE ITS OBJECTIVES IN THE COMING MONTHS, AS </p><p>ASAD FOCUSES INCREASINGLY ON THE LEGACY HE WILL LEAVE </p><p>HIS SON BASHAR -- INCLUDING POSSIBLE RESUMPTION OF </p><p>PEACE TALKS WITH ISRAEL AND IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH </p><p>HIS NEIGHBORS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THIS MESSAGE RESPONDS TO REF A TASKING, WHICH </p><p>SOUGHT POST\'S VIEWS ON HOST COUNTRY SUCCESSION ISSUES. </p><p>THE HEADERS BELOW TRACK WITH THOSE IN THE TASKING. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>TRANSITION LIKELIHOOD/TIMING </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) GIVEN PRESIDENT HAFIZ AL-ASAD\'S AGE (I.E., </p><p>OFFICIALLY 69 AND POSSIBLY OLDER, REF B) AND HEALTH </p><p>CONCERNS (I.E., HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES) A </p><p>SUCCESSION COULD REALISTICALLY TAKE PLACE AT ANY TIME </p><p>AND POSSIBLY WITHIN THE TIMEFRAME OF HIS JUST-STARTED </p><p>SEVEN-YEAR TERM OF OFFICE.  THERE ARE ALSO INDICATIONS </p><p>THAT ASAD\'S MENTAL ACUITY AND ATTENTIVENESS ARE BEING </p><p>GRADUALLY ERODED BY THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF AGE AND </p><p>DISEASE.  PERVASIVE SECURITY IN SYRIA HAS MADE IT </p><p>DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT </p><p>POWERBASES.  THEREFORE, IN THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERMS, </p><p>A CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSITION, BY PROVIDING </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL TIME, WOULD LIKELY SERVE THE INTERESTS </p><p>OF THOSE WHO MAY BE INCLINED TO OR BE POSITIONED FOR A </p><p>GRAB FOR POWER.  WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE AND PERHAPS </p><p>LIKELY THAT THE SUCCESSION WILL PLAY OUT INITIALLY IN </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHANNELS, EXTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>SCENARIOS, INCLUDING COUPS AND COUNTER-COUPS, CANNOT </p><p>BE RULED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>POTENTIAL NEW LEADERS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SYRIAN SUCCESSION IS CURRENTLY CLOUDED BY THE </p><p>PASSING FROM THE SCENE OF MANY ASAD-GENERATION </p><p>POWERBROKERS AND THE EMERGENCE OF NEW LEADERS FROM </p><p>WITHIN A POWER STRUCTURE WITH WHICH WESTERNERS HAVE </p><p>LITTLE OR NO CONTACT.  IN THE NEARER TERM AT LEAST, IF </p><p>ASAD DIES IN OFFICE OR BECOMES PERMANENTLY </p><p>INCAPACITATED, THE FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT WILL PLAY A </p><p>KEY ROLE.  ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION, IN SUCH </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRST VICE PRESIDENT ABD AL-HALIM </p><p>KHADDAM, HOLDS FULL PRESIDENTIAL POWERS FOR UP TO 90 </p><p>DAYS, DURING WHICH TIME A PRESIDENTIAL REFERENDUM MUST </p><p>TAKE PLACE.  IN THIS PERIOD, THE BA\'TH PARTY WOULD </p><p>RECOMMEND A CANDIDATE TO THE PARLIAMENT WHICH </p><p>"DEBATES" THE CANDIDACY AND THEN VOTES ON WHETHER THE </p><p>CANDIDATE\'S NAME WILL MOVE FORWARD TO THE FINAL STEP </p><p>OF A NATIONAL REFERENDUM.  (NB:  UNDER THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION, ASAD CAN DESIGNATE A NEW FIRST VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT AT ANY TIME.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) BEHIND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, HOWEVER, THE </p><p>ALAWI-DOMINATED MILITARY AND SECURITY SERVICES WILL </p><p>PLAY THE KEY ROLE AND LIKELY DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF </p><p>SUCCESSION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SENIOR BA\'TH PARTY </p><p>LEADERSHIP (I.E., THE 20-MEMBER REGIONAL COMMAND, </p><p>WHICH HAS MILITARY REPRESENTATION).  THE SERVICES ARE </p><p>THE PRIMARY PILLAR OF THE ASAD REGIME, FOLLOWED IN </p><p>DESCENDING ORDER OF IMPORTANCE BY THE BA\'TH PARTY, </p><p>GOVERNMENT, PARLIAMENT, GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE SUNNI MERCHANT </p><p>CLASS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COLONEL BASHAR AL-ASAD:  PRESIDENT ASAD APPEARS </p><p>TO BE BETTING THAT HIS FINAL TERM IN OFFICE WILL ALLOW </p><p>SUFFICIENT TIME FOR AN ORDERLY TRANSITION TO POWER FOR </p><p>HIS SON BASHAR.  IF ASAD MAKES IT THROUGH HIS SEVEN </p><p>YEAR TERM, BASHAR WILL HAVE REACHED THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED PRESIDENTIAL AGE OF 40.  THE </p><p>TRANSITION EFFORT BEGAN IN EARNEST OVER THE LAST YEAR, </p><p>AS WITNESSED MOST DRAMATICALLY IN THE MILITARY- </p><p>SECURITY SERVICES, THROUGH A DECISION TO MINIMIZE </p><p>CAREER EXTENSIONS AT RANK, THUS ALLOWING FOR INCREASED </p><p>MILITARY RETIREMENTS.  RETIRED OFFICERS, INCLUDING </p><p>SOME REGIME HEAVYWEIGHTS, ARE BEING REPLACED WITH </p><p>YOUNGER ONES BELIEVED TO BE LOYAL OR AT LEAST NOT A </p><p>THREAT TO BASHAR.  BASHAR IS ALSO INCREASINGLY BEING </p><p>POSITIONED AS A SYRIAN STATESMAN, HOLDING SEPARATE </p><p>HIGH-PROFILE MEETINGS WITH LEBANESE OFFICIALS, </p><p>JORDANIAN KING \'ABDULLAH AND, MOST RECENTLY, IRANIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT KHATAMI. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ASSUMING THE MILITARY TRANSITION IS MOVING </p><p>REASONABLY WELL, ASAD WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE PARALLEL </p><p>CHANGES IN THE SENIOR BA\'TH PARTY MEMBERSHIP.  ONLY </p><p>AFTER THESE TWO STEPS ARE SUCCESSFULLY UNDERWAY WOULD </p><p>ASAD MOVE TO CONSIDER CONSTITUTIONAL AND OTHER CHANGES </p><p>TO ALLOW FOR BASHAR TO ASSUME A VICE-PRESIDENCY OR AN </p><p>OUTRIGHT EARLY ASSUMPTION OF POWER.  THE SUCCESS OF </p><p>THIS SCENARIO IS PREDICATED UPON ASAD HAVING THE TIME </p><p>AND HEALTH TO COMPLETE THE PREPARATIONS AND ON </p><p>BASHAR\'S ABILITY TO SEIZE ON THE HEAD START HIS FATHER </p><p>IS ATTEMPTING TO PROVIDE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT ABD AL-HALIM KHADDAM: </p><p>WITH THE DEPARTURE OF CHIEF-OF-STAFF HIKMAT AL- </p><p>SHIHABI, VP KHADDAM (67) REMAINS ARGUABLY THE MOST </p><p>TRUSTED SUNNI IN THE ASAD REGIME.  THERE IS MUCH TALK </p><p>AND SOME EVIDENCE THAT SOME OF KHADDAM\'S PORTFOLIOS -- </p><p>E.G. LEBANON -- ARE GRADUALLY BEING TRANSFERRED TO </p><p>BASHAR.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE BELIEVE KHADDAM STILL </p><p>HOLDS A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE CLOSED CIRCLE AROUND THE </p><p>PRESIDENT.  AS LONG AS KHADDAM REMAINS FIRST VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT, HE ENJOYS PRIDE OF PLACE IN ANY </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL SUCCESSION SCENARIO.  KHADDAM HAS NO </p><p>INDEPENDENT POWER BASE, AND HIS THINKING PROBABLY </p><p>ALIGNS VERY CLOSELY WITH ASAD\'S AND WITH THE MILITARY- </p><p>SECURITY LEADERSHIP.  VARIOUS SOURCES INDICATE KHADDAM </p><p>MIGHT BE OPEN TO ECONOMIC REFORM BUT, ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, HE IS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY HARD-LINE ON THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) KHADDAM, THEREFORE, COULD FULFILL SEVERAL ROLES </p><p>FROM A 90-DAY OVERSEER OF TRANSITION TO A TRANSITIONAL </p><p>PRESIDENT IN A QUASI-COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP SCENARIO. </p><p>COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP IN POST-INDEPENDENCE SYRIA HAS </p><p>USUALLY SERVED AS A PERIOD FOR THE EMERGENCE OF </p><p>MULTIPLE POWER CENTERS VYING FOR DOMINANCE.  HISTORY </p><p>MAY WELL REPEAT ITSELF.  IF ASAD\'S DEATH TAKES PLACE </p><p>FOUR OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, KHADDAM MIGHT BE ABLE TO </p><p>FINISH OUT ASAD\'S SUCCESSION PLANS FOR BASHAR, </p><p>ASSUMING BASHAR HAD RISEN TO THE OCCASION.  IF NOT, </p><p>ALAWI POWERBROKERS MAY ALREADY HAVE BEGUN LOOKING AT </p><p>ALTERNATIVES IN WHOM TO ENTRUST THEIR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) BG \'ASIF SHAWQAT:  ONE OF THOSE ALTERNATIVES </p><p>MAY BE PRESIDENTIAL SON-IN-LAW SHAWQAT (53).  AN </p><p>ALAWI, SHAWQAT MIGHT WELL BE CALLED THE COMEBACK </p><p>PLAYER OF THE REGIME.  HE WAS ONCE ONE OF SMI CHIEF </p><p>LTG \'ALI DUBA\'S MOST TRUSTED SUBORDINATES, BUT FELL </p><p>FROM GRACE AND WAS ACTUALLY RETIRED AND IMPRISONED </p><p>(1993), SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE OF REPORTED DEALINGS IN </p><p>SMUGGLING AND NARCOTICS, BUT MORE LIKELY BECAUSE ASAD </p><p>DID NOT APPROVE OF SHAWQAT\'S PLANS TO MARRY HIS ONLY </p><p>DAUGHTER BUSHRA.  THE SHAWQATS HAVE SINCE PROVIDED </p><p>PRESIDENT ASAD WITH HIS ONLY GRANDCHILDREN AND ALL </p><p>APPEARS TO BE FORGIVEN.  SHAWQAT HOLDS A SHADOWY BUT </p><p>POWERFUL POSITION AS HEAD OF AN INDEPENDENT SECURITY </p><p>SERVICE THAT CAN INVESTIGATE ANYONE, "FROM CIVILIANS </p><p>TO MILITARY OFFICERS TO THE PRIME MINISTER."  OUR SLIM </p><p>HOLDINGS ON THIS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT PLAYER INDICATE </p><p>THAT SHAWQAT IS TOUGH, EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT, WELL- </p><p>READ, QUIET AND A SELF-STARTER.  HE OBVIOUSLY ALSO HAD </p><p>THE MOXIE TO STAND UP TO ASAD HIMSELF AND FOLLOW </p><p>THROUGH ON HIS MARRIAGE TO BUSHRA.  IF HE CAN ALSO </p><p>STILL COUNT ON \'ALI DUBA\'S SUPPORT, IT WOULD BE </p><p>ANOTHER PLUS, BUT THIS MAY BE DOUBTFUL SINCE HE HAS </p><p>EMERGED AS A RIVAL TO DUBA\'S LONG-TIME DOMINANCE OF </p><p>SMI.  HE IS ALSO REPORTED TO COME FROM A RELATIVELY </p><p>MINOR \'ALAWI FAMILY/CLAN, WHICH MEANS HE CANNOT </p><p>AUTOMATICALLY COMMAND A STRONG \'ALAWI SUPPORT BASE. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) RIF\'AT AL-ASAD:  BLACK SHEEP PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>BROTHER RIF\'AT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED A LONG SHOT, BUT </p><p>HIS NAME AND TOUGH-GUY REPUTATION STILL RESONATE WITH </p><p>MANY ALAWIS.  HE IS ALSO AMBITIOUS, NOT ONLY FOR </p><p>HIMSELF BUT FOR HIS SONS.  MANY OF OUR CONTACTS, WHILE </p><p>DISCOUNTING HIS CURRENT INFLUENCE IN SYRIA AND IN THE </p><p>\'ALAWITE COMMUNITY, NEVERTHELESS WILL SAY THAT HE </p><p>CANNOT BE COMPLETELY COUNTED OUT IN ANY SUCCESSION </p><p>SCENARIO.  SUNNIS, HOWEVER, REVILE HIM FOR HIS ROLE IN </p><p>THE HAMA/ALEPPO MASSACRES OF THE EARLY 80\'S.  HE IS A </p><p>SYMBOL OF DIVISIVENESS, ETHNIC CONFLICT AND </p><p>REPRESSION.  RIF\'AT\'S FORTUNES COULD NEVERTHELESS </p><p>IMPROVE IF ALAWI SUPREMACY APPEARED THREATENED AND THE </p><p>NEED FOR A HEAVY HAND WAS FELT AND, PARTICULARLY, IF </p><p>SUCCESSION OCCURRED EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER AND </p><p>BASHAR WAS NOT DEEMED READY.  RIF\'AT HIMSELF IS </p><p>PLAINLY STILL INTERESTED IN LEADING SYRIA AFTER ASAD\'S </p><p>DEMISE.  HE REPORTEDLY MADE THE HAJJ THIS YEAR, WHICH </p><p>WAS SEEN AS A MOCKERY BY SUNNIS HERE, AND HE IS AN IN- </p><p>LAW OF SAUDI CROWN PRINCE \'ABDULLAH. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) MAJOR MAHIR AL-ASAD (33):  WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE FOR </p><p>THE RECORD THAT THE NAME OF ASAD\'S PENULTIMATE SON IS BEING </p><p>HEARD INCREASINGLY AROUND DAMASCUS.  HE IS DESCRIBED </p><p>ALTERNATELY AS MORE LIKE HIS FATHER (THAN BASHAR) OR LIKE </p><p>HIS UNCLE RIF\'AT.  THE BANDYING ABOUT OF MAHIR\'S NAME MAY </p><p>BE AN INDICATION OF DISSATISFACTION WITH BASHAR\'S PROGRESS </p><p>TO DATE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. INTERACTION/BACKGROUND ON U.S. CONTACTS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) WE HAVE MADE ANY NUMBER OF ULTIMATELY </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS, INCLUDING DIRECT REQUESTS BY </p><p>DIPLOMATIC NOTE, TO MEET WITH THE MILITARY/SECURITY </p><p>AND BA\'TH PARTY PERSONALITIES THAT ARE LIKELY TO </p><p>DETERMINE AND BE A PART OF SYRIA\'S SUCCESSION, </p><p>INCLUDING BASHAR.  IT IS CLEAR TO US THAT THESE KEY </p><p>PERSONALITIES ARE OFF LIMITS TO OFFICIAL USG CONTACTS </p><p>AND, CONSEQUENTLY, OUR INFORMATION TENDS TO COME FROM </p><p>SECONDARY SOURCES.  FOR THEIR PART, OTHER THAN </p><p>OCCASIONAL PRIVATE VISITS TO THE U.S., THESE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS ALSO AVOID OFFICIAL CONTACTS WITH U.S. </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES EXCEPT IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p>MOREOVER, THOSE IN THE MILITARY/SECURITY HIERARCHY </p><p>LIKELY VIEW U.S. MOTIVES WITH SUSPICION AND AS A </p><p>POTENTIAL THREAT.  AS WE HAVE SEEN, THE SECURITY </p><p>APPARATUS HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY OBSTACLE TO SYRIA\'S </p><p>ACQUISITION OF CELL PHONE AND INTERNET TECHNOLOGY.  IT </p><p>IS INSTRUCTIVE THAT WHILE THE PRESIDENT\'S SON MAY BE </p><p>THE MOST WESTERN-EDUCATED OF SUCCESSOR CANDIDATES, </p><p>THIS FACT MAY ACTUALLY WORK AGAINST HIS SUCCESS IN THE </p><p>SYRIAN CONTEXT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THREATS TO STABILITY </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) INTERNAL:  THE PRIMARY THREAT TO STABILITY IS </p><p>INTERNAL, WITH A BREAKDOWN OF \'ALAWI COHESION AND THE </p><p>ABILITY TO WORK THROUGH AND WITH SUPPORTIVE SUNNIS </p><p>BEING PERHAPS THE MOST SERIOUS POSSIBILITY.  HISTORY </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT A POWER STRUGGLE COULD DEVELOP AMONG </p><p>SENIOR ELEMENTS OF THE SARG, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>FAMILY.  HAFIZ AL-ASAD HAS RULED IN DAMASCUS LONGER </p><p>THAN ANY LEADER SINCE MU\'AWIYAH FOUNDED THE UMMAYAD </p><p>DYNASTY IN 661, BUT HE IS VERY MUCH THE EXCEPTION IN </p><p>SYRIAN POLITICS.  ACCORDING TO ONE HISTORIAN, THE </p><p>PERIOD FROM SYRIA\'S INDEPENDENCE IN 1946 UNTIL ASAD </p><p>SEIZED POWER IN 1970 WAS MARKED BY "ONE OF THE WORLD\'S </p><p>HIGHEST RECORDS FOR MILITARY PUTSCHES AND COUPS." </p><p>WHILE DESTABILIZING, MOST OF THESE COUPS WERE, </p><p>FORTUNATELY, RELATIVELY BLOODLESS WITH VIOLENCE </p><p>CONFINED TO THE PLAYERS AND THEIR IMMEDIATE </p><p>SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) IF AMBITION AND SELF-INTEREST CAN BE BALANCED </p><p>AND CONTAINED THROUGH BACKROOM NEGOTIATIONS, </p><p>COLLECTIVE SUPPORT OF A SUITABLE CANDIDATE AND </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHANNELS, STABILITY WILL BE LARGELY </p><p>PRESERVED.  INDEED, THE QUICK ATTAINMENT OF A NEW </p><p>POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM WILL PROBABLY BE THE KEY TO </p><p>SYRIA\'S INTERNAL STABILITY.  IF SYRIA\'S TRANSITION </p><p>LEADERS FAIL IN THIS REGARD, THE POST INDEPENDENCE </p><p>HISTORY OUTLINED ABOVE SUGGESTS THAT ANY EXTRA- </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL POWER STRUGGLE OR COUP WOULD BE </p><p>RELATIVELY QUICK AND CONFINED BUT PRONE TO REPETITION </p><p>UNTIL A NEW POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM WERE REACHED. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND SUNNI-\'ALAWI FRICTION: </p><p>A SUCCESSION THAT IS NOT SETTLED QUICKLY COULD BE SEEN </p><p>BY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) (REF C) OR OTHER </p><p>INTERNAL ACTORS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE REGIME, </p><p>FURTHER COMPLICATING THE SUCCESSION.  THE SARG-MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD ENCOUNTERS OF THE 70S-80S PROVIDED THE </p><p>ONLY WIDESPREAD CIVIL CONFLICT IN RECENT SYRIAN </p><p>HISTORY.  ASAD BIOGRAPHER PATRICK SEALE HAS POINTED </p><p>OUT THIS STRUGGLE WAS MORE THAN A SECULAR-ISLAMIST </p><p>CONFRONTATION, "BEHIND THE IMMEDIATE CONTEST LAY THE </p><p>OLD MULTI-LAYERED HOSTILITY BETWEEN ISLAM AND THE </p><p>BA\'TH, BETWEEN SUNNI AND \'ALAWI, BETWEEN TOWN AND </p><p>COUNTRY."  WHILE THE MB UPRISING WAS UTTERLY CRUSHED, </p><p>THE CAUSATIVE ISSUES ARE STILL PRESENT AND THE MB </p><p>ITSELF LIKELY HAS MANY CLOSET SYMPATHIZERS IN SYRIA. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE BRUTAL 1982 EXTERMINATION OF UP TO </p><p>25,000 SUNNIS AT HAMA BY (MAINLY) \'ALAWIS IS FOREVER </p><p>SEARED IN THE MEMORY OF MOST SUNNIS AND IS A </p><p>CONTINUING OBSTACLE TO RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE </p><p>MAJORITY SUNNIS AND THE \'ALAWI-CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT. </p><p>BEYOND THE MB, OTHER INTERNAL THREATS COULD APPEAR IN </p><p>A POWER VACUUM SUCH AS A RISE IN SYRIAN KURDISH </p><p>NATIONALISM OR THE FRACTURE OF SOCIETY ALONG ECONOMIC- </p><p>SOCIAL LINES. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY COULD BE ANOTHER </p><p>ISSUE COMPLICATING SUCCESSION.  THE SARG HAS BEEN ABLE </p><p>TO MAINTAIN AN OVERALL STANDARD OF LIVING THAT, WHILE </p><p>ERODING, KEEPS THE POPULACE PACIFIED IF NOT HAPPY.  IF </p><p>THE SARG CANNOT MAINTAIN THE MINIMUM STANDARD OF </p><p>LIVING FOR SYRIANS, POPULAR DISCONTENT COULD PROVIDE A </p><p>MORE VOLATILE ATMOSPHERE FOR SUCCESSION.  IT IS NOT </p><p>HARD TO ENVISION A SCENARIO IN WHICH ISLAMISTS TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF A DISTRACTED SARG AND ECONOMIC UNREST TO </p><p>PROMOTE VIOLENT CHANGE.  IN THIS SITUATION \'ALAWIS AND </p><p>SECULARIST SUNNI\'S WOULD FIND ALLIES AMONG BOTH THE </p><p>DRUZE AND VARIOUS CHRISTIAN GROUPS WHO WOULD ALL FEEL </p><p>THEIR INTERESTS THREATENED BY AN MB RESURGENCE. </p><p>LONGER-TERM STABILITY IS THREATENED BY THE FACT THAT </p><p>MOST SYRIANS FEEL LITTLE CONNECTION WITH THEIR </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  IF THERE IS RESIDUAL SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>REGIME THAT ACTS AS A STABILIZING FACTOR, IT IS </p><p>THROUGH THE PERSONALITY AND RECOGNIZED STATURE OF </p><p>HAFIZ AL-ASAD.  NEITHER BASHAR NOR OTHER CONTENDERS </p><p>WILL HAVE THIS SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) EXTERNAL:  IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE, A DRAWN- </p><p>OUT SUCCESSION ALSO RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVES BY </p><p>EXTERNAL ACTORS, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH </p><p>INTERNAL UNREST.  THE PERIOD FROM SYRIA\'S INDEPENDENCE </p><p>UNTIL ASAD TOOK POWER WAS ALSO NOTABLE FOR THE </p><p>PERVASIVENESS OF EXTERNAL INFLUENCES ON THE </p><p>PERENNIALLY STRUGGLING GOVERNMENT.  IN THE 50S, IRAQ, </p><p>EGYPT, LEBANON, JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ALL MEDDLED </p><p>ACTIVELY IN SYRIAN AFFAIRS.  NURI SAID\'S IRAQ SOUGHT </p><p>UNION; EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA SOUGHT INFLUENCE; AND </p><p>KING \'ABDULLAH OF JORDAN ENVISIONED A HASHEMITE- </p><p>DOMINATED GREATER SYRIA, EVEN LEBANON HAD A HAND, </p><p>THROUGH THE MACHINATIONS OF THE LEBANESE-BASED </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE SYRIAN SOCIALIST NATIONALIST PARTY </p><p>(SSNP) -- THE MAIN RIVAL FOR INFLUENCE TO THE BA\'TH </p><p>PARTY AMONG SECULAR NATIONALISTS IN SYRIA UNTIL 1955. </p><p>BRITAIN, FRANCE, THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION ALSO COMPETED FOR INFLUENCE AS SYRIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENTS CAME AND WENT IN RAPID SUCCESSION. </p><p>WESTERN PRESSURE TO JOIN THE BAGHDAD PACT BACKFIRED, </p><p>DESTABILIZING THE COUNTRY AND EVENTUALLY CATALYZING A </p><p>HASTY UNION WITH EGYPT, WHICH IN TURN OPENED THE DOOR </p><p>TO INCREASED SOVIET INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) BECAUSE OF SYRIA\'S STRATEGIC GEOPOLITICAL </p><p>POSITION, IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT SUCH A </p><p>TURBULENT STATE OF AFFAIRS COULD RECUR.  IN A </p><p>PROLONGED SUCCESSION STRUGGLE, SYRIAN ISLAMISTS MIGHT </p><p>BE EMBOLDENED BY ASSISTANCE FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES </p><p>RANGING FROM SAUDI ARABIA TO USAMA BIN LADIN; IRAQ </p><p>MIGHT SEEK INFLUENCE THROUGH ITS BA\'THIST CONNECTIONS </p><p>OR SEEK TO DESTABILIZE THROUGH INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS </p><p>AND SABOTAGE; AND SOME LEBANESE ACTORS COULD ALSO SEE </p><p>A WEAKENED AND DESTABILIZED SYRIA AS THE KEY TO </p><p>REVERSING DECADES OF STRONG INFLUENCE IN LEBANESE </p><p>AFFAIRS BY DAMASCUS.  MOREOVER, SYRIA\'S OPEN DOOR TO </p><p>FELLOW ARABS -- NO ARAB NEEDS A VISA TO SYRIA -- COULD </p><p>BECOME A LIABILITY.  OFTEN DESCRIBED AS "CARDS" TO BE </p><p>PLAYED, THE PRESENCE OF 366,000 PALESTINIANS </p><p>(INCLUDING MANY REJECTIONIST GROUPS), IRAQI KURDS, AND </p><p>OTHER ELEMENTS COULD BECOME SOURCES OF INSTABILITY </p><p>INSTEAD, ESPECIALLY AS LINKS TO OUTSIDE AGENTS OF </p><p>INFLUENCE.  NOT LEAST, THE THREE NON-ARAB REGIONAL </p><p>POWERS -- TURKEY, ISRAEL AND IRAN -- ALL CONSIDER THAT </p><p>THEY HAVE IMPORTANT POLICY EQUITIES IN SYRIA, AND ALL </p><p>HAVE SOME CAPACITY FOR AFFECTING SYRIAN AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>U.S. INTERESTS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) IN A SUCCESSION/TRANSITION PERIOD (AS WE HAVE </p><p>BEGUN TO SEE) SYRIAN LEADERS\' FIRST PRIORITY WILL BE </p><p>REGIME SURVIVAL AND CONSOLIDATION OF POWER.  IN THE </p><p>SYRIAN CONTEXT, THIS WILL NOT BE A PERIOD FOR NEW </p><p>THINKING OR TAKING RISKS, BUT FOR CONSERVATIVE </p><p>ADHERENCE TO LONG-STANDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, SUCCESSION PARTICULARLY, IN THE SHORT </p><p>AND MEDIUM TERM, IS NOT LIKELY TO BRING POSITIVE </p><p>SYRIAN MOVEMENT ON KEY U.S. INTERESTS SUCH AS </p><p>CONCLUDING A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL PEACE; CONTROLLING </p><p>WMD; COUNTERING TERRORISM OR ADVANCING HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>WHAT CAN THE U.S. DO NOW?:  U.S. ACTIONS/TIMELINE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) IF SUCCESSION IS UNLIKELY TO PRODUCE A SYRIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT READY TO UNDERTAKE BOLD INITIATIVES, IT MAY </p><p>BE THAT THE PERIOD PRIOR TO TRANSITION OFFERS </p><p>IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT </p><p>ASAD DOES NOT WANT TO HAND OVER A COUNTRY WHICH HAS </p><p>ADVERSARIAL RELATIONS WITH ALL OF ITS NEIGHBORS.  WITH </p><p>THIS POSSIBILITY AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN ISRAEL IN </p><p>MIND, THE U.S. MAY FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE ITS </p><p>OBJECTIVES OVER THE COMING MONTHS, AS HAFIZ AL-ASAD </p><p>FOCUSES ON PREPARING FOR THE SUCCESSION IN SYRIA.  THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS IS ONE OBVIOUS AREA.  IT MAY BE SOME </p><p>TIME BEFORE ANOTHER SYRIAN LEADER WOULD BE ABLE TO </p><p>CONSOLIDATE HIS POSITION SUFFICIENTLY TO CONCLUDE AND </p><p>IMPLEMENT A PEACE AGREEMENT.  CONCLUDING A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE PEACE WOULD OPEN ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO </p><p>ADVANCE OUR INTERESTS ON COUNTER-TERRORISM AND WMD. </p><p>ON IRAQ, SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR CURRENT UN POLICIES IS </p><p>MAINTAINED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FELT NEED TO INSIST ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF UN RESOLUTIONS SO THAT SYRIA CAN </p><p>SIMILARLY INSIST THAT ISRAEL RESPECT UN RESOLUTIONS. </p><p>A NEW REGIME MAY BE LESS DISCIPLINED IN THIS REGARD </p><p>THAN ASAD\'S SYRIA, AND THUS MORE LIKELY TO BE SWAYED </p><p>BY THE MOOD OF THE ARAB STREET AND THE PERCEIVED </p><p>SUFFERING OF IRAQIS UNDER UN SANCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>CROCKER </p><p></p></div>
