<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002529 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, EAID, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: POLOFF AND UN OFFICER DETAINED, THREATENED BY WAR </p><p>VETERANS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) Self-described Zimbabwean war veterans detained Poloff </p><p>on November 15, together with a UN Senior Humanitarian </p><p>Affairs Officer, a US Embassy driver, and a Zimbabwean </p><p>citizen guide, for 45 minutes at a farm in Melfort (about 25 </p><p>kms southeast of Harare).  The war veterans beat the </p><p>Zimbabwean citizen guide extensively and the Embassy driver </p><p>slightly, and roughed up the UN Official, but Poloff was </p><p>spared.  The war vets also seized the UN Official\'s identity </p><p>card issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the </p><p>Zimbabweans\' identity cards, and Poloff\'s camera and </p><p>notebook.  Even though RSO was in communication with Police </p><p>throughout the incident, Police have not yet detained anyone. </p><p> The Embassy has sent a strongly worded diplomatic note </p><p>protesting the incident and stating that we expect the GOZ to </p><p>identify, detain, and take legal action against the war </p><p>veterans involved (text faxed to AF/S).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Self-described Zimbabwean war veterans detained Poloff </p><p>on November 15, together with Andrew Timpson, a UN Senior </p><p>Humanitarian Affairs Officer, a US Embassy driver, and a </p><p>Zimbabwean citizen guide, for 45 minutes at the Thanner farm </p><p>in Melfort (about 25 kms southeast of Harare).  Poloff and </p><p>Timpson were interviewing ex-commercial farm workers on the </p><p>farm for about 45 minutes concerning their food situation </p><p>when war veterans arrived and began violently interrogating </p><p>the party.  Poloff identified himself, gave them a business </p><p>card, apologized for any offense and offered to depart with </p><p>the whole party to avoid any problems.  The war veterans </p><p>refused the offer stating that they were going to detain and </p><p>beat the party. </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwean Guide Beaten Extensively </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) The war veterans then beat the Zimbabwean citizen </p><p>guide extensively on the head, sides, and back with open </p><p>hands and long heavy sticks; he suffered a punctured eardrum </p><p>and loss of hearing in that ear as a result.  The war </p><p>veterans also beat the US Embassy driver on the back, roughed </p><p>up the UN Official slightly, but Poloff was spared.  After </p><p>searching the Embassy vehicle and the party\'s bags, the war </p><p>veterans instructed the party to get in the Embassy vehicle </p><p>and follow the war veterans\' pick-up truck to an undisclosed </p><p>location off the farm.  After following the pick-up to the </p><p>main road, the Embassy party broke off and returned to the </p><p>Embassy.  The war veterans confiscated the party\'s still </p><p>camera, cell phones, identity cards, and various papers.  The </p><p>cell phones were returned however. </p><p> </p><p>Police Notified </p><p>--------------- </p><p>4. (C) Just before the situation deteriorated, Poloff </p><p>notified Polchief by cell phone of the problem but was cut </p><p>off by the war veterans who seized Poloff\'s phone.  Polchief </p><p>notified the Ambassador and RSO who notified the Police and </p><p>requested that Police send units immediately to the Thanner </p><p>farm, seal off roads, and arrest the individuals responsible. </p><p> RSO also notified the UN Security Officer, Valdim Aunshko </p><p>who said he would go to Harare Police Headquarters and demand </p><p>action.  Police Headquarters in Harare then notified RSO that </p><p>units had been dispatched to the area.  Following the return </p><p>of Poloff and the party to the Embassy, Police then requested </p><p>that Poloff and the Embassy driver return to the local Police </p><p>station in the area to identify suspects in a lineup.  RSO </p><p>later learned from Police that there were no suspects in </p><p>custody, but that Police wished the complaint to be filed in </p><p>the area of the crime.  We have declined to send our officers </p><p>back to the area, and instead offered to file a complaint in </p><p>Harare. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) After first notifying the Foreign Ministry of the </p><p>matter and requesting its intervention, the Embassy sent a </p><p>diplomatic note to the Minister of Foreign Affairs on </p><p>November 15, vigorously protesting the incident, requesting </p><p>action to apprehend and charge those individuals responsible, </p><p>return items seized, and issue a public statement that no </p><p>Zimbabwean individual or organization has the right to </p><p>interfere with the legitimate humanitarian work of the United </p><p>Nations, any diplomatic mission including that of the United </p><p>States.  The Ambassador has coordinated all our actions with </p><p>the UN ResRep.  The UN has protested orally to the Foreign </p><p>Ministry Director for International Organizations, and will </p><p>send a diplomatic note parallel to the US note. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>6. (C) Although Embassy sent a diplomatic note in protest to </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and interactions with Police </p><p>Headquarters in Harare were constant, the fact that the </p><p>Police were unable to respond to the scene during the 45 </p><p>minute incident, even though they were informed of the </p><p>unfolding event five minutes after it started, reflects badly </p><p>on the ability / willingness of GOZ authorities to ensure the </p><p>safety of diplomatic personnel during the course of </p><p>humanitarian work.  The GOZ\'s willingness to bring those </p><p>guilty of these offenses to justice will serve as a measure </p><p>of their commitment to working with us and other donors in </p><p>addressing the unfolding humanitarian crisis of the GOZ\'s own </p><p>making.  However the incident is dealt with after the fact, </p><p>the actions of war veterans / settlers reflects the </p><p>continuing state of lawlessness at a time when the GOZ is </p><p>proclaiming that the agricultural redistribution exercise has </p><p>been completed.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
