Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary. At the end of July, the government of </p><p>Turkey (GOT) stopped issuing licenses for corn imports </p><p>without any prior notification. Turkish officials claim that </p><p>the action was taken in order to assess the number of </p><p>licenses issued rather than to inhibit trade.  After the </p><p>corn duty was increased from 20 to 45 percent today, August </p><p>8, the GOT began issuing licenses again.  One shipment of </p><p>U.S. corn arrived on August 7 without licenses.  Once the </p><p>tariff was increased, the buyers were issued import licenses </p><p>and were able to discharge their corn, which had become </p><p>significantly more expensive overnight. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>No Formal Advance Notification </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) On July 28, the GOT stopped issuing new import </p><p>licenses for corn. As is normally the case, the GOT gave no </p><p>advance warning of their actions. This action proved </p><p>ultimately to be tied to the increase in the tariff, which </p><p>rose to 45 percent on August 8. Turkey often applies higher </p><p>tariffs during the harvest in order to placate domestic </p><p>producers.  Corn, rice, and even high fructose corn syrup </p><p>(HFCS) have had import duties significantly raised this </p><p>summer. Normally, as proved to be the case with the U.S. </p><p>vessel of corn, licenses are withheld for a short period </p><p>until the tariffs are raised. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>A Situation of Their Own Making </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) THE CURRENT SITUATION IS DUE, IN GREAT PART, TO </p><p>UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET CAUSED BY TURKISH POLICIES. IN </p><p>JUNE, THE TURKISH GRAIN BOARD (TMO) ANNOUNCED A DOMESTIC </p><p>PROCUREMENT PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $215/TON FOR CORN.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, THE STRONG TURKISH LIRA HAS BEEN SUPPORTING </p><p>GREATER IMPORTS OF LOWER-PRICED CORN.  TURKISH CORN IMPORTS </p><p>WERE EXPECTED TO REACH BETWEEN 1.5 - 1.6 MILLION TONS WITH 1 </p><p>MILLION TONS EXPECTED TO COME FROM THE UNITED STATES IN </p><p>2003.  TURKISH IMPORTERS HAVE BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE </p><p>FAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATES IN ORDER TO STOCKPILE CORN FOR THE </p><p>COMING YEAR.  TURKEY\'S CORN SUPPLIES CAN FLUCTUATE, CREATING </p><p>GREAT UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET.  FURTHER, IMPORTERS AND END- </p><p>USERS DON\'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHEN TARIFFS WILL BE REDUCED. </p><p>AS A RESULT, THEY IMPORT IN GREAT QUANTITIES TO COVER FUTURE </p><p>NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) While many companies are able to anticipate </p><p>imminent changes in import policy such as tariff increases </p><p>and license restrictions, the official import regime does </p><p>not allow them to plan purchases without risk.  According to </p><p>the official regulations, a Certificate of Origin is </p><p>required as part of the application for an import license. </p><p>Since a Certificate of Origin cannot be received until the </p><p>vessel is loaded, the importer must commit to shipping a </p><p>cargo before even applying for an import license.  Every </p><p>year importers are `caught out\' under this system with a </p><p>cargo on the way without an import license.  The same </p><p>scenario results from sudden non-notified changes in phyto- </p><p>santiary regulations.  The GOT does not seem to realize that </p><p>the millions of dollars paid in demurrage fees and other </p><p>costs primarily impact Turkish companies and are a </p><p>deadweight loss on the Turkish economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Helpful or Helpless? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The trader and buyers of the U.S. corn contacted </p><p>FAS/Ankara to intervene with the GOT on their behalf.  On </p><p>Aug 5 Ag Attache met with Dr. Nihat Pakdil, General Director </p><p>of Protection and Control, which is the branch of the </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that governs the </p><p>import licensing system.  In response to concerns raised </p><p>regarding the GOT import licensing regime and the vessel of </p><p>U.S. corn, Dr. Pakdil claimed that the temporary halt in </p><p>issuing import licenses was not an effort to stop trade.  He </p><p>also indicated that the license and tariff issues were not </p><p>related.  Note:  He is correct in the sense that tariff </p><p>changes are made by the Ministry of Finance, however it is a </p><p>coordinated policy.  End Note.  He also stated that the GOT </p><p>was delaying the issuance of further import licenses in </p><p>order to assess the number of licenses issued in response to </p><p>complaints from domestic producers that too much corn was </p><p>being imported.  When pressed, Dr. Pakdil said it should </p><p>only be a matter of days before new licenses would be </p><p>issued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) NOTE: WHILE UNWILLING TO TAKE ANY DIRECT ACTION TO </p><p>RESOLVE THE SITUATION, DR. PAKDIL DID ALLUDE TO A FUTURE </p><p>RESOLUTION.  THIS SUGGESTS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SUCH </p><p>DECISIONS ARE COORDINATED AT A MUCH HIGHER POLITICAL LEVEL </p><p>THAT IS IMMUNE TO OUR CONCERNS.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT:  THE BIGGER PICTURE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) THE CURRENT LICENSING PROBLEM ONLY APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>AFFECTED ONE VESSEL, ALBEIT AT SIGNIFICANT COST.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE GOT\'S IMPORT LICENSING REGIME SYSTEM IS KNOWN FOR BEING </p><p>NON-TRANSPARENT AND FOR OBSTRUCTING TRADE IN COMMODITIES AND </p><p>FOOD PRODUCTS.  THESE LICENSES ARE REQUIRED FOR EVERY SINGLE </p><p>IMPORTED FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT.  THESE LICENSES, AND </p><p>THE FAILURE TO ISSUE THEM, POSE AN ANNUAL CHALLENGE TO CORN, </p><p>RICE, WHEAT, BANANAS, HFCS AND OTHER COMMODITIES THAT ARE </p><p>CONSIDERED SENSITIVE.  CITING HEALTH CONCERNS, THE GOT OFTEN </p><p>WITHHOLDS CERTIFICATES FROM A NUMBER OF HIGH-VALUED </p><p>PROCESSED FOODS AS WELL.  THIS APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE </p><p>OF THE GOT IGNORING ITS WTO RESPONSIBILITIES.  THESE </p><p>COORDINATED POLICIES CONTINUE TO OBSTRUCT TRADE WHILE </p><p>CREATING UNCERTAINTY AND INCREASING COSTS FOR U.S. EXPORTERS </p><p>AND TURKISH IMPORTERS ALIKE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
