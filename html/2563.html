DCM RECENTLY MET WITH NEW </p><p>VATICAN MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR, TOMASSO COPPOLA, MONSIGNOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01171  01 OF 02  061557Z </p><p>JOHAN BONNY, A CHIEF NEGOTIATOR IN THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR </p><p>CHRISTIAN UNITY, AND MEMBERS OF THE ARAB DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY </p><p>ACCREDITED TO THE VATICAN.  THE VATICAN\'S FOREIGN POLICY IS </p><p>GENERALLY FOUNDED ON "DEFENDING THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN </p><p>PERSON", AND IS THUS LARGELY CONGRUENT WITH USG INTERESTS. </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE EAST, HOWEVER, IT HAS A NUMBER OF PARTICULAR </p><p>INTERESTS, SOME WHERE WE CAN EXPECT TO AGREE, OTHERS WHERE </p><p>OUR INTERESTS ARE STARKLY OPPOSITE.  THE VATICAN\'S INTERESTS </p><p>IN THIS REGION ARISE FROM AN INDIGENOUS CONSTITUENCY (E.G. </p><p>CHALDEANS IN IRAQ) AS WELL AS DIALOG WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH </p><p>OF THE EAST AND THE ORIENTAL ORTHODOX CHURCHES OF THE REGION </p><p>(EG. THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH).  COUNTRIES OF INTEREST ARE </p><p>MOST NOTABLY LEBANON, IRAQ, SYRIA AND TO A LESSER DEGREE </p><p>JORDAN AND EGYPT.  THE LACK OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR THE </p><p>FOREIGN CATHOLICS (MOSTLY FILIPINO GUEST WORKERS) IN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA WILL REMAIN AN ISSUE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE FOR THE </p><p>VATICAN.  FROM A STRICTLY GEOPOLITICAL PERSPECTIVE THE </p><p>VATICAN WILL ALSO STRIVE TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH IRAN. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) CONCERN FOR CATHOLIC MINORITIES </p><p> </p><p>AS WITH ANY NATION-STATE, THE VATICAN STRIVES TO PROTECT ITS </p><p>"CITIZENS" OVERSEAS.  FOR THE VATICAN, THIS </p><p>CITIZEN-CONSTITUENCY IS COMPOSED OF CATHOLICS.  IN THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST THE COUNTRY OF PRIME CONCERN IN THIS REGARD IS LEBANON. </p><p>ACCORDING TO VATICAN ISSUED FIGURES, THERE ARE 1.9 MILLION </p><p>CATHOLICS IN LEBANON, 311,000 CATHOLICS IN SYRIA, AND 277,000 </p><p>CATHOLICS IN IRAQ.  THE VATICAN DOES NOT CONSIDER LEBANON A </p><p>MUSLIM COUNTRY WITH A CATHOLIC MINORITY, BUT A COUNTRY IN </p><p>WHICH CATHOLICS ARE EQUAL PARTNERS.  IT SEES LEBANON AS A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01171  01 OF 02  061557Z </p><p>COUNTRY WHICH SHOULD SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR </p><p>CHRISTIAN/ISLAMIC COEXISTENCE.  FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN, AS </p><p>WELL AS MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR COPPOLA HAVE BOTH SERVED IN </p><p>LEBANON, AND ARE PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THE LEBANESE </p><p>SITUATION.  ALTHOUGH, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL VATICAN FIGURES, </p><p>THERE ARE MORE CATHOLICS IN SYRIA THAN IRAQ, THE VATICAN IS </p><p>MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE CHALDEAN CATHOLICS IN </p><p>IRAQ THAN WITH THAT OF THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN SYRIA. </p><p>THIS IS BECAUSE THE VATICAN SEES THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST REGIME COMING TO POWER AS HIGHER IN IRAQ THAN </p><p>IN SYRIA.  THERE IS ALSO A SMALL CATHOLIC MINORITY IN JORDAN </p><p>(72,000 ACCORDING TO VATICAN FIGURES) COMPOSED OF ETHNIC </p><p>PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) DIALOG WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST AND THE </p><p>ORIENTAL ORTHODOX CHURCHES </p><p> </p><p>THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST WAS THE FIRST MAJOR CHRISTIAN </p><p>BODY TO FALL OUT ON COMMUNION WITH ROME.  THIS OCCURRED IN </p><p>THE 5TH CENTURY OVER THEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.  ITS SEAT WAS </p><p>MOVED FROM PERSIA TO BAGHDAD IN 766 WHERE IT HAS REMAINED. </p><p>IN 1553 A GROUP FROM WITHIN THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH REENTERED </p><p>COMMUNION WITH ROME, WHICH WAS THE START OF THE CHALDEAN </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH.  THE VATICAN IS CLOSER TO "REUNIFICATION" </p><p>WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST THAN WITH ANY OTHER BODY </p><p>OF EASTERN CHURCHES.  IN 1994, POPE JOHN PAUL II AND THE </p><p>ASSYRIAN PATRIARCH SIGNED A DECLARATION WHICH BASICALLY ENDED </p><p>ALL THEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.  DIALOG CONTINUES FOR FULL </p><p>REUNIFICATION.  THUS, IN ADDITION TO PROTECTING THE CATHOLIC </p><p>COMMUNITY OF IRAQ, THE VATICAN NEEDS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01171  01 OF 02  061557Z </p><p>IRAQI GOVERNMENT FOR AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WITH THE "OFFICIAL" IRAQI CHRISTIAN CHURCH CAN CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p>THE ORIENTAL ORTHODOX COMMUNITY IS COMPOSED OF SIX </p><p>INDEPENDENT NATIONAL CHURCHES WHICH ARE IN COMMUNION WITH </p><p>EACH OTHER, BUT NOT WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST, THE </p><p>ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, OR THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES (E.G. GREEK, </p><p>RUSSIAN, ETC).  THIS BODY BROKE WITH THE MAIN BODY OF THE </p><p>CHURCH (AT THAT TIME LOCATED IN ROME AND CONSTANTINOPLE) IN </p><p>THE FIFTH CENTURY, APPROXIMATELY 30 YEARS AFTER THE ASSYRIAN </p><p>CHURCH\'S BREAK.  THIS ORIENTAL ORTHODOX COMMUNITY IS COMPOSED </p><p>OF THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH, THE COPTIC ORTHODOX CHURCH </p><p>(EGYPT), THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH, THE MALANKARA ORTHODOX SYRIAN CHURCH (INDIA), AND THE </p><p>ERITREAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.

THAT </p><p>SAID, THE VATICAN HAS TO TREAD CAREFULLY IN THIS AREA.  AFTER </p><p>SEVERAL JOINT DECLARATIONS WITH THE ARMENIAN CHURCH, COPTIC </p><p>POPE SHENOUDA III OF EGYPT DECLARED THAT DIALOG WITH THE </p><p>VATICAN MUST BE DONE ON A FULL COMMUNITY BASIS, AND NOT BY </p><p>INDIVIDUAL NATIONAL MEMBERS.  THUS, THE VATICAN NOW HAS TO BE </p><p>MORE SENSITIVE TO THE DESIRES OF THE EGYPTIAN COPTIC </p><p>COMMUNITY AND THE SYRIAN ORTODOX CHURCH IF IT WANTS PROGRESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01171  02 OF 02  061557Z </p><p>IN THE OVERALL DIALOG. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) WHAT ARE THE VATICAN\'S INTERESTS AND WHAT SHOULD THE </p><p>U.S. EXPECT </p><p> </p><p>-- LEBANON:  THE VATICAN WANTS TO MAINTAIN A STRONG CHRISTIAN </p><p>PRESENCE IN A UNIFIED, INDEPENDENT LEBANON.   IT WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR THE REMOVAL OF ALL FOREIGN TROOPS (I.E. </p><p>SYRIAN) AND REINTEGRATION OF THE SOUTH INTO THE COUNTRY.  WE </p><p>SHOULD EXPECT THE VATICAN TO CONTINUE TO ASK THE UNITED </p><p>STATES TO HAVE STRONGER, BETTER CONTACTS WITH MARONITE </p><p>PATRIARCH SAFIR.  WE SHOULD ALSO EXPECT THE VATICAN TO </p><p>EXPRESS CONCERN OVER WHAT THEY SEE AS RETALIATION AGAINST THE </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF </p><p>COLLABORATING WITH THE ISRAELIS. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ:  IRAQ WILL REMAIN A BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND VATICAN.  WE SHOULD EXPECT THE VATICAN TO </p><p>STRONGLY CONDEMN THE CONTINUED EMBARGO AS "HARMFUL" TO THE </p><p>IRAQI POPULATION.  IN ITS EYES, THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN EXCEPT AN ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST REGIME. THUS </p><p>FOR REASONS OF PROTECTING THE CATHOLICS IN IRAQ, AS WELL AS </p><p>CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE </p><p>ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST, THE VATICAN WILL BE AMONG THE </p><p>LEAST VOCAL INTERNATIONAL CRITICS OF THE CURRENT REGIME.  WE </p><p>SHOULD EXPECT VOCAL, PUBLIC CRITICISM OF ANY MILITARY ACTION </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA:  BECAUSE DAMASCUS IS THE SEAT OF THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH, AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE CATHOLIC </p><p>COMMUNITY, THE VATICAN IS CONTINUE TO SEEK CORRECT, GOOD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01171  02 OF 02  061557Z </p><p>RELATIONS WITH SYRIA.  AS IT DOES NOT FEAR A FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>TAKE OVER, IT CAN BE EXPECTED TO BE LESS SENSITIVE TO </p><p>CRITICISM OF SYRIAN POLICY THAN TO IRAQI POLICY.  THAT SAID, </p><p>VATICAN FRUSTRATION OVER THE OVERT ANTI-SEMITIC REMARKS OF </p><p>PRESIDENT ASSAD DURING THE POPE\'S APRIL, 2001 VISIT TO SYRIA </p><p>HAVE SUBSIDED.  IN FACT, THE POPE RECENTLY SUSPENDED HIS </p><p>LENTEN RETREAT (WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL) TO MEET ASSAD DURING </p><p>THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT\'S VISIT TO ROME; </p><p> </p><p>IRAN:  THE NUMBER OF CATHOLICS IS MINUSCULE (12,000 BY </p><p>VATICAN ESTIMATES).  HOWEVER, THE VATICAN SEES IRAN AS A </p><p>PARTNER IN CATHOLIC/ISLAMIC DIALOG.  IT WILL THEREFORE STRIVE </p><p>TO HAVE PROPER RELATIONS WITH THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN; </p><p> </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA: THERE ARE OVER 1 MILLION FOREIGN CATHOLICS IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA.  THE VATICAN WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THEIR RIGHT </p><p>TO PRACTICE CATHOLICISM AN INTERNATIONAL ISSUE.
