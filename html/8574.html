<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003365 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OTRA, ECON, AMGT, JO (POWELL COLIN L.) </p><p>SUBJECT: TRAVEL OF NEA ADVANCE TEAM FOR WORLD ECONOMIC </p><p>FORUM - REQUEST FOR COUNTRY CLEARANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 152361 </p><p> </p><p>1. Embassy Amman grants country clearance to State/NEA </p><p>personnel Gary Grappo, Amy Schedlbauer, Jessica Davies and </p><p>Sonia Franceski to Amman, Jordan from o/a June 10 to o/a June </p><p>25, 2003.  Purpose of the trip is to assist in coordinating </p><p>and preparing for USG participation in the World Economic </p><p>Forum Extraordinary Annual Meeting at the Dead Sea.  We </p><p>welcome the opportunity to support and take action on </p><p>planning and coordination with Grappo and the Jordanians and </p><p>propose that Embassy Control Officer Tom Goldberger be </p><p>assigned full time to collaborate and coordinate with Grappo </p><p>and team.  Contact numbers for Mr. Goldberger are as follows: </p><p>office: 011-962-6-592-0101, ext. 2556; fax: </p><p>011-962-6-592-7653; home: 011-962-6-585-9657, mobile: </p><p>011-962-79-560-8995.  The Embassy\'s after-hours telephone </p><p>number is: 011-962-6-592-0120. </p><p> </p><p>2. The Embassy has begun holding internal meetings to prepare </p><p>for WEF-related logistical requirements and to assign control </p><p>officers.  We expect that Grappo and advance team members </p><p>will join these countdown meetings beginning June 12.  We </p><p>have also requested a meeting for Grappo with Planning </p><p>Minister Awadallah (the Jordanian WEF Coordinator) on June </p><p>12.  We understand that WEF officials will not begin work in </p><p>Amman until June 15.  Control officer Goldberger will be </p><p>available for all meetings between the NEA advance team and </p><p>Jordanian and WEF officials. </p><p> </p><p>3. As requested in reftel, post has been in contact with WEF </p><p>North America coordinator Corine Blesi in Geneva about hotel </p><p>rooms, transportation, and credentialing requirements for the </p><p>U.S. delegations.  We have also described to her the basic </p><p>requirements of the two Congressional delegations that are </p><p>expected to coincide with the delegation led by the </p><p>Secretary.  With the NEA advance team\'s involvement and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>assistance, we will work with the WEF and the Jordanians on </p><p>the coordinated needs of the official U.S. delegation and </p><p>CODELs for transportation, hotel room, security, and other </p><p>official USG requirements, such as arrangements for press </p><p>events and bilateral meetings with Jordanian officials and </p><p>other WEF participants. </p><p> </p><p>4. Valid visas are required for entry into Jordan.  Visas may </p><p>be obtained at Queen Alia airport; however, Embassy suggests </p><p>visitors obtain their visas in Washington prior to departure </p><p>as there can be long lines for visa issuance at the airport. </p><p>Money can be exchanged at the airport. </p><p> </p><p>5. Embassy has reserved accommodations at the Four Seasons </p><p>Hotel, a 10-minute ride to the Embassy.  Phone: </p><p>962-6-550-5555; Fax:  962-6-550-5556.  The hotel is within </p><p>the per diem allowance.  The hotel accepts Visa, Master Card </p><p>and Amex.  An Embassy driver and expeditor will meet Mr. </p><p>Grappo and Ms. Franceski on June 11, and Ms. Schedlbauer on </p><p>June 14, upon their arrival at the airport and accompany them </p><p>to the hotel.  Post understands Ms. Davies will arrive POV </p><p>from Damascus. </p><p> </p><p>6. Embassy Amman direct charges each office, agency and </p><p>visiting delegation for all costs incurred in support of </p><p>official travel.  These costs include American and foreign </p><p>service national employees\' overtime, holiday pay and premium </p><p>pay as applicable, field travel by Embassy personnel, </p><p>transportation costs, vehicle rental, telephone installation </p><p>and service, cell phone rental and service for visiting party </p><p>and embassy employees, long distance telephone calls, </p><p>equipment rental, printing expenses, photocopying, </p><p>maintenance service contracts on rental equipment, control </p><p>room expenses, hospitality room expenses, and any other costs </p><p>that can be directly attributed to the visit. </p><p> </p><p>Travelers are requested to provide fiscal data for all </p><p>relevant costs. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Threat assessment: </p><p> </p><p>Although the anger associated with the war in Iraq has </p><p>subsided to some degree at present, the lingering emotional </p><p>impact could well continue to fuel the threat to Americans in </p><p>Jordan. Post is currently investigating a shooting incident </p><p>near an Amman hotel that has the appearance of a random act </p><p>of violence against an American.  Recent incidents remind us </p><p>of the ability of transnational terrorist groups, as well as </p><p>less sophisticated local elements, to target Americans and </p><p>Western interests in Jordan.  In March 2003, individuals </p><p>acting under instructions from the former Iraqi government </p><p>attempted to detonate an incendiary device in an Amman hotel. </p><p>A group in southern Jordan was arrested in December 2002 for </p><p>planning a possible attack against the embassy. The October </p><p>28, 2002 assassination of a U.S. diplomat in Amman outside </p><p>his residence was ultimately linked to Al-Qaida.  The </p><p>perpetrators of the assassination were arrested by Jordanian </p><p>authorities in December 2002.  Recent worldwide terrorist </p><p>alerts have stated that extremist groups continue to plan </p><p>terrorist attacks against U.S. interests.  In October 2002, </p><p>Americans in Jordan were informed of a potential kidnapping </p><p>plot by Al-Qaida.  In December 1999, a group affiliated with </p><p>the Al-Qaida organization was arrested in Jordan.  This group </p><p>was in the late planning stages of carrying out attacks </p><p>against Western hotels and tourist sites. </p><p> </p><p>The State Department has urged Americans in Jordan to </p><p>consider their personal security and well being, including </p><p>consideration of departure from the country.  Americans who </p><p>visit Jordan despite this warning should exercise maximum </p><p>caution and take prudent measures to maintain their security. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Travel guidelines: </p><p> </p><p>American citizens and official visitors traveling in Jordan </p><p>should exercise caution, be alert and stay informed of </p><p>regional and local events that could quickly impact the </p><p>security environment in the country.  Travelers should avoid </p><p>large crowds and demonstrations and take measures to avoid </p><p>areas where they are most likely to occur (city centers, </p><p>universities, refugee camps), particularly during periods of </p><p>increased tension.  It is also recommended to maintain a low </p><p>profile and not establish predictable patterns of movement, </p><p>even if only visiting for a short period. Taxis are the only </p><p>form of public transportation that is recommended. </p><p> </p><p>Crime is generally not a serious problem for travelers in </p><p>Jordan, although petty crime is somewhat common in the </p><p>downtown Amman Hashimiyah Square area and near the Roman </p><p>theater.  In the narrow streets of the old city and at some </p><p>of the more popular tourist sites, crowded conditions invite </p><p>pickpockets and other petty criminals.  Travelers are </p><p>recommended to be more guarded in these areas and not present </p><p>easy opportunities to criminals. </p><p> </p><p>As Jordan is an Islamic country, cultural sensitivities </p><p>should be observed.  Female travelers should dress </p><p>conservatively and not travel alone, particularly in areas </p><p>not as accustomed to western visitors. Incidents of sexual </p><p>harassment, assault and unwelcome advances of a sexual nature </p><p>against western visitors and residents, although not </p><p>frequent, have been reported.  These incidents, while </p><p>troubling, have not been pervasive. </p><p> </p><p>9.
