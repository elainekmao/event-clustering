<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 PRETORIA 005586 </p><p> </p><p>CAPE TOWN ALSO FOR EMBASSY, LONDON FOR MCKINLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  FIGHTING PERCEPTIONS AND SUBSTANCE: THABO MBEKI </p><p> </p><p>REFLECTS ON THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON ANC INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS </p><p>DIRECTOR AND SENIOR NEGOTIATOR THABO MBEKI APRIL 23 TO </p><p>OBTAIN A READOUT ON THE STATE OF PLAY IN THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  MBEKI WAS CONFIDENT THAT AGREEMENT CAN BE </p><p>REACHED ON A DATE CERTAIN FOR ELECTIONS BY THE END OF </p><p>MAY.  THE SAG\'S PROPOSAL OF EARLY FEBRUARY 1994 WOULD </p><p>GIVE NO HEARTBURN TO THE ANC.  REGARDING THE TRANSITIONAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (TEC), HE WAS LESS SANGUINE, NOTING </p><p>THAT VIRTUALLY NO WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON THE SUBCOUNCILS </p><p>FOR PUBLIC FINANCE, LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THAT THERE ARE CONTINUING PROBLEMS ON SECURITY FORCES </p><p>OVERSIGHT.  HE COMPLAINED OF A PERCEPTION, FANNED BY </p><p>ELEMENTS IN AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT, THAT THE ANC </p><p>LEADERSHIP IS NOT IN CONTROL OF A PRO-INSURRECTION </p><p>FACTION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.  THAT PERCEPTION, </p><p>COMMUNICATED AS FACT IN ANALYSES REACHING DE KLERK\'S </p><p>DESK, MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CUT A DEAL ON THE TRANSITION </p><p>WITH THE SAG, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE PRESSURE IS ON TO DO </p><p>SO. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT IF THE SAG IS WORRIED </p><p>ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE MODERATES TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP </p><p>IN THE ANC, IT CAN DO NO BETTER THAN MAKE THE NEGOTIATING </p><p>PROCESS CREDIBLE TO THE MAJORITY, THUS STRENGTHENING THE </p><p>POSITION OF ANC MODERATES.  MBEKI ALSO WORRIED ABOUT HOW </p><p>TO DEAL WITH THE CONCERNED SOUTH AFRICANS GROUP (COSAG), </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE INKATHA FREEDOM PARTY, WHICH HAS NOT YET </p><p>BOUGHT INTO THE GAMEPLAN OF A CONSTITUTION DRAFTED BY AN </p><p>ELECTED BODY.  AMBASSADOR ADVISED THE ANC TO PROPOSE A </p><p>REASONABLE SETTLEMENT ON REGIONALISM, SHORED UP BY THE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY.  SUCH A SOLUTION WOULD WEAKEN ANY </p><p>REASON FOR THEIR WALKING OUT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE FOUND MBEKI GENERALLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WOULD ADHERE TO THE ENVISAGED TIME FRAMES, </p><p>BUT CONCERNED THAT THE SAG MAY LOOK FOR WAYS TO BACKTRACK </p><p>ON COMMITMENTS AS THE DEADLINE FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>APPROACHES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>ELECTION DATE NOT A PROBLEM BUT MAJORITY RULE? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5.  MBEKI LED OFF BY SHOWING AMBASSADOR A SAG PROPOSAL </p><p>FOR THE SHAPE OF THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT.  MBEKI POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT IT APPEARED REASONABLE AFTER A CURSORY </p><p>EXAMINATION, EXCEPT FOR DECISION-MAKING IN THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>LEADERS.  THAT NEW BODY, A SORT OF SUPER CABINET </p><p>CONSISTING OF THE LEADERS OF EACH OF THE POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES IN THE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY (GONU), WOULD </p><p>TAKE DECISIONS ON MAJOR POLICIES BY MAJORITY VOTE, EACH </p><p>LEADER HAVING ONE VOTE.  THE NET EFFECT IS TO LESSEN THE </p><p>POWER OF THE CABINET AND THE VALUE OF THE PROPORTIONAL </p><p>ELECTORAL STRENGTH OF THE PARTICIPANTS.  THE ANC, WHILE </p><p>NOT OPPOSED TO SOME SORT OF COUNCIL, WILL HAVE TO SEEK </p><p>MODIFICATION OF BOTH ITS DEGREE OF AUTHORITY AND </p><p>PROCEDURE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ON THE ISSUE OF A DATE FOR ELECTIONS, MBEKI FORESEES </p><p>NO PROBLEM.  THE TWO PRESIDENTS, MANDELA AND DE KLERK, </p><p>MET IN MARCH AND AGREED TO USE THE MONTH OF APRIL TO </p><p>PERSUADE THEIR RESPECTIVE ALLIES OF THE NEED TO MOVE ON </p><p>THIS QUESTION.  THE SAG HAS PROPOSED A DATE IN EARLY </p><p>FEBRUARY 1994, TO WHICH THE ANC AND ITS ALLIES CAN AGREE. </p><p>MBEKI IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE IFP, WHICH HAS A COMPLETELY </p><p>DIFFERENT SCENARIO FOR WHEN ELECTIONS SHOULD TAKE PLACE. </p><p>AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT BOTH SAG AND ANC WORK ON THE </p><p>IFP TO CHANGE ITS POSITION.  HE ADDED THAT, AS BUTHELEZI </p><p>TRAVELS TO LONDON THE FOLLOWING WEEK, THE ANC MIGHT </p><p>SUGGEST THE BRITISH PRESS HIM AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>TEC: PLENTY OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  "IT SEEMS PEOPLE FORGOT CODESA\'S DECISIONS," MBEKI </p><p>MUSED IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY ABOUT THE STATE </p><p>OF AGREEMENT ON THE POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE TEC. </p><p>NOTHING HAS HAPPENED SINCE LAST YEAR ON THE SUBCOUNCIL </p><p>DEALING WITH PUBLIC FINANCE.  CONFUSION REIGNS ON THE </p><p>FUNCTION OF A SUBCOUNCIL FOR REGIONAL AND LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT, TO WHICH THE ANC CONTRIBUTED BY SUGGESTING </p><p>THAT THE NEGOTIATORS GO BACK TO THE USE OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S </p><p>FOUR PROVINCES.  THIS GOES COUNTER TO THE ANC\'S OWN </p><p>POSITION ON USE OF NINE OR TEN REGIONS AND MBEKI SAID THE </p><p>ANC WOULD GO BACK TO THIS IN THE NEXT BILATERAL WITH THE </p><p>SAG.  IT IS UNCLEAR NEVERTHELESS HOW SUCH A SUBCOUNCIL </p><p>WOULD IMPACT ON THE PROCESS OF GOVERNING, REINCORPORATION </p><p>OF THE HOMELANDS OR PREPARATIONS FOR THE ELECTION.  BROAD </p><p>AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED WITH THE GOVERNMENT REGARDING </p><p>THE SUBCOUNCIL ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SINCE PIK BOTHA, NOW </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT HIS PLACE IN HISTORY AS LEADER OF THE </p><p>ANTIAPARTHEID FORCES IN THE NATIONAL PARTY, WANTS TO MOVE </p><p>AHEAD QUICKLY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  UMKHONTO WE SIZWE COMMANDER JOE MODISE HAD BEEN SENT </p><p>THAT MORNING TO CAPE TOWN TO MEET WITH HIS MILITARY </p><p>COUNTERPART IN A BID TO UNBLOCK NEGOTIATIONS ON THE </p><p>SUBCOUNCIL PERTAINING TO THE SECURITY FORCES.  MBEKI </p><p>OPINED THAT THE NEGOTIATORS MUST MOVE AWAY FROM THE </p><p>PHRASE "JOINT CONTROL" WHICH THE SADF THINKS IS TOO </p><p>LOADED.  THE ANC WANTS THE POLITICAL AUTHORITY TO SAY </p><p>WHAT HAPPENS VIS-A-VIS THE ARMED FORCES.  THUS, JOINT </p><p>SUPERVISION MIGHT BE THE MORE APT TERM.  THE ANC DOES NOT </p><p>WANT OPERATIONAL CONTROL OVER THE SADF.  MBEKI TOLD </p><p>MODISE TO MAKE THAT POINT VERY CLEAR TO THE SADF. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>THE INSURRECTIONIST FACTION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN THIS CONNECTION, MBEKI EXPLAINED THAT PART OF THE </p><p>PROBLEM ON CLINCHING A DEAL ON THE SECURITY FORCES IS THE </p><p>FACT THAT, IN AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO </p><p>SAY THAT THE ANC\'S CURRENT PRAGMATIC LEADERSHIP MAY SOON </p><p>BE REPLACED BY AN INSURRECTIONIST FACTION.  IF THE SAG </p><p>AGREES TO JOINT CONTROL WITH THIS LEADERSHIP, THEN THE </p><p>SUCCESSORS WILL HAVE THE LEGAL INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH TO </p><p>WREAK HAVOC WITH THE SECURITY FORCES.  IT IS A POINT OF </p><p>"ULTRASENSITIVITY" IN THE SAG.  SUCH AN ANALYSIS HAS EVEN </p><p>REACHED DE KLERK\'S DESK AND HAS BEEN PRESENTED AS FACT. </p><p>HOW TO DISPEL SUCH PERCEPTIONS?  THEY HAVE REPERCUSSIONS </p><p>ON ANC POLICY MAKING, GIVING HARDLINERS AMMUNITION AND </p><p>RESONANCE WHEN THEY ARGUE THAT SAG FAILURE TO MOVE AT THE </p><p>NEGOTIATING TABLE MEANS IT WANTS TO CLING TO POWER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  CONTINUING, MBEKI VOICED CONCERN OVER EXAGGERATED </p><p>MEDIA FOCUS ON THE "ANGER" OF THE ANC RANK AND FILE </p><p>FOLLOWING CHRIS HANI\'S ASSASSINATION.  OLIVER TAMBO AND </p><p>HE WENT TO HANI\'S HOME FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION AND </p><p>DID NOT FIND THE PEOPLE MILLING AROUND TO BE ANGRY.  THE </p><p>RANK AND FILE WERE OUTRAGED AND UPSET, BUT NOT ANGRY IN </p><p>A REVOLUTIONARY OR UNCONTROLLABLE SENSE.  MARCHERS IN </p><p>JOHANNESBURG APRIL 17, HE SAID, IN FACT BEAT LOOTERS AND </p><p>TURNED THEM OVER TO THE POLICE.  AMBASSADOR COMMENTED </p><p>THAT, PUT IN PERSPECTIVE, THE AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE WAS </p><p>MINIMAL IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TURNED </p><p>OUT FOR VARIOUS EVENTS MARKING HANI\'S DEATH.  IF THE SAG </p><p>IS WORRIED ABOUT THE STABILITY OF THE ANC LEADERSHIP IT </p><p>IS DEALING WITH, THE AMBASSADOR ADDED, THEN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO REINFORCE THE </p><p>CREDIBILITY OF THAT LEADERSHIP.  THE WAY TO DO SO IS </p><p>THROUGH MAKING THE NEGOTIATIONS CREDIBLE IN TERMS OF REAL </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND THEREBY MAKING THE ANC\'S LEADERSHIP, WHICH </p><p>IS COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATIONS, UNCHALLENGEABLE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>HOW TO DEAL WITH COSAG? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  "WHAT HAPPENS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONVINCE COSAG?" </p><p>MBEKI PONDERED, ONCE THE SAG AND ANC HAVE REACHED </p><p>AGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTING THE TRANSITION.  COSAG COULD </p><p>VERY WELL BLOCK THE PROCESS, A FACT THAT MIGHT REQUIRE </p><p>UNSPECIFIED UNILATERAL ACTION BY THE SAG.  BUTHELEZI </p><p>MIGHT WELL WALK OUT.  THE SAG AND ANC HAVE NOT YET </p><p>DECIDED WHETHER THE PROCESS WOULD THEN MOVE FORWARD </p><p>WITHOUT HIM.  AMBASSADOR REMARKED THAT BUTHELEZI IS </p><p>ALREADY UNHAPPY WITH THE SPEED AT WHICH THE PROCESS IS </p><p>MOVING.  IT BEHOOVES THE ANC TO PROPOSE A REASONABLE </p><p>SETTLEMENT ON REGIONALISM, BUTHELEZI\'S MOST LEGITIMATE </p><p>CONCERN.  JOE MATTHEWS, AT THE ASPEN CONFERENCE, HAD </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE ANC AND IFP MIGHT NOT BE SO FAR APART </p><p>ON THIS ONE.  IF THIS ISSUE IS ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY AND </p><p>BUTHELEZI\'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY SUPPORTERS BEGIN SAYING </p><p>"WE WANT A SETTLEMENT," HIS ARGUMENTS FOR WALKING OUT </p><p>WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED, ALTHOUGH ONE COULD NOT </p><p>RULE OUT A BUTHELEZI WALKOUT EVEN THEN.  MOREOVER, SUCH </p><p>AN APPROACH WOULD AVOID THE NEED TO RIDE ROUGHSHOD OVER </p><p>BUTHELEZI.  MBEKI AGREED AND NOTED THAT A CONVENIENT DATE </p><p>HAS NOT YET BEEN FOUND TO MEET WITH THE IFP FOR </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  AMBASSADOR INFORMED MBEKI THAT HE HAD MET WITH </p><p>BOPHUTHATSWANA "PRESIDENT" MANGOPE IN DECEMBER AND FOUND </p><p>HIM UNMOVING ON THE QUESTION OF REINCORPORATION.  MBEKI </p><p>REPLIED THAT MANGOPE SEES THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL AND </p><p>WANTS IN PLACE A REGIME WITH WHICH HE IS COMFORTABLE </p><p>BEFORE REINCORPORATING.  THE SAG HAS PRESENTED MANGOPE A </p><p>PAPER ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT REINCORPORATING, AND </p><p>ROELF MEYER URGED BUTHELEZI TO GET HIS ALLIES TO MOVE ON </p><p>IT.  PIK BOTHA HAS GIVEN THE ANC ASSURANCES THAT THE SAG </p><p>WILL KEEP THE PRESSURE ON.  THE ANC, MBEKI SAID, WILL </p><p>MEET MANGOPE AGAIN TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO JOIN THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS\' CONSENSUS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  WE FOUND MBEKI GENERALLY UPBEAT ABOUT THE </p><p>APPROACHING ENDGAME.  HE WAS MOST CONCERNED THAT SAG </p><p>JITTERS AS THE FINALITY OF IT SINKS IN MAY CAUSE IT TO </p><p>BACKTRACK ON AGREEMENTS.  HE SAID AS MUCH MERELY BY </p><p>SHOWING US THE SAG\'S PROPOSAL FOR THE SHAPE OF THE </p><p>INTERIM GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  WE FOUND MUCH TO THINK ABOUT IN MBEKI\'S ASSESSMENT </p><p>THAT UNCHALLENGED, ERRONEOUS PERCEPTIONS HAVE A NOXIOUS </p><p>IMPACT ON THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS.  THERE IS A DANGER </p><p>OF CHALLENGE TO ANC LEADERSHIP FROM THE LEFT, BUT IT IS </p><p>MORE OUTSIDE THAN WITHIN THE ANC.  MOREOVER, WE CONCUR </p><p>THAT THE POPULAR MOOD HERE IS NOT ONE OF DESTRUCTION.  WE </p><p>INTEND TO UNDERSCORE THAT POINT IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND </p><p>IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT FIGURES AND THE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY, WHILE UNDERSCORING THE NEED FOR </p><p>SPEEDY RESULTS FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE </p><p>THAT SITUATION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>LYMAN </p><p></p></div>
