A) HARARE 1827 </p><p>     B. B) HARARE 1822 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary.  Pursuant to the August 9 deadline for the </p><p>first wave of commercial farmers to abandon their homesteads, </p><p>in one region police have confronted farmers on five separate </p><p>properties, and in a second region another farmer faces </p><p>forced eviction.  Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) president </p><p>David Hasluck states that his organization is extrapolating a </p><p>new August 31 deadline for vacating the homesteads, based on </p><p>President Mugabe\'s speech at Monday\'s Heroes\' Day </p><p>commemoration.  Otherwise matters remain at an impasse.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The four-day Heroes Day weekend, which followed the </p><p>August 9 deadline for commercial farmers with compulsory </p><p>acquisition notices to vacate their homesteads, passed with </p><p>very few reports of GOZ action or confrontation.  The CFU now </p><p>estimates that of the 4500 farms under notice of acquisition, </p><p>only about 1300 had section 8 orders which "matured" on </p><p>August 9, and that the number of farms with "mature" section </p><p>8 orders would be increasing every day.  CFU president David </p><p>Hasluck believes that while many owners had chosen to be </p><p>absent (on holiday or for safety reasons) over the previous </p><p>weekend, owners of approximately 2500 listed farms have </p><p>refused to vacate their properties despite the deadline.  The </p><p>hardline advocacy group Justice for Agriculture (JAG, reftel </p><p>A), on the other hand, estimates that over 60% of the owners </p><p>of 6022 listed farms, along with staff and families, have </p><p>remained on their farms despite the August 9 deadline.  The </p><p>discrepancies in the two sets of numbers result from the </p><p>differences in unit numbers; while there are a total of 6148 </p><p>separate title deeds, of which 6022 are under some notice of </p><p>acquisition, many farms consist of multiple title deeds, with </p><p>the average running 1.5 title deeds per farm.  Nevertheless, </p><p>JAG estimates that over 1.5 million people, mostly commercial </p><p>farm workers and their families, are  affected by the </p><p>overhanging uncertainty. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In the Middle Save area in southeastern Zimbabwe, a </p><p>group of five farmers who are reportedly growing a winter </p><p>wheat crop were visited twice over the long weekend by an </p><p>eviction force comprising police and representatives of the </p><p>local land committee.  According to David Hasluck, the newly </p><p>appointed Zanu-PF member in charge of the Zimbabwe Republic </p><p>Police (ZRP) in that area is being very aggressive in </p><p>pursuing the perceived policies of his superiors.  While </p><p>Hasluck was reluctant to use the words "forced off their </p><p>land," he did concede that the CFU had agreed that the </p><p>farmers in question should not remain resident on the land as </p><p>of Monday, although they were urged to continue farming until </p><p>they were forcibly prevented.  Additionally, in the Mazowe </p><p>area approximately 30 km north of Harare, one farmer reported </p><p>to the CFU that he is currently (1000 hours local time) </p><p>facing an attempt at eviction, although it is not clear to </p><p>the CFU whether that action is originating from police, GOZ </p><p>officials, war vets, or settlers. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Hasluck stated that the CFU has extrapolated a "new" </p><p>August 31 deadline for vacating homesteads from President </p><p>Mugabe\'s Heroes Day speech on August 12 (septel), wherein </p><p>Mugabe stated that newly settled farmers must be on their </p><p>land by month\'s end in order to prepare the land for the </p><p>coming season and the coming rains.  Hasluck believes that </p><p>the policy of the GOZ -- to the extent that there is one -- </p><p>is to keep the remaining farmers in a heightened state of </p><p>uncertainty by forcing a few random evictions per week, while </p><p>simultaneously hoping that the farmers give in to the </p><p>increasing pressure and abandon their property of their own </p><p>accord. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: Despite Mugabe\'s continued insistence that </p><p>there will be no going back on his chaotic land reform </p><p>program, the CFU continues to grasp at any glimmer of </p><p>reprieve that its members can discern.  Hasluck is likely </p><p>correct in his assessment that evictions will occur in a </p><p>random and representative fashion, although questions of who, </p><p>when and how are yet to be answered.  End comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
