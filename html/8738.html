<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001373 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>RIYADH PLEASE PASS U/S BOLTON PARTY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, OTRA, OVIP, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR UNDER SECRETARY BOLTON\'S VISIT TO </p><p>YEMEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE ALAN G. MISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) You are the most senior State Department official to </p><p>visit Yemen since Secretary Baker came in late 1990.  The </p><p>ROYG thus recognizes your visit as an important opportunity </p><p>to continue building the positive bilateral relations that </p><p>have evolved in the aftermath of the Cole and 9/11 attacks, </p><p>so your brief stay in Yemen should be productive.  Our </p><p>post-9/11 CT cooperation with Yemen has achieved important </p><p>successes, and President Saleh has shown resolve; but your </p><p>visit forces the Yemenis to focus on areas of the </p><p>relationship that are difficult for them, particularly SCUDs </p><p>and cooperation with North Korea.  Your discussions with </p><p>Defense Minister Aliwa and, especially, FM Qirbi will advance </p><p>the U.S. agenda on those issues, and on Article 98.  This </p><p>cable follows up your discussion with AMB Hull in Washington </p><p>early this month. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Yemen and North Korea </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Yemenis have no ideological affinity for the DPRK, </p><p>but like to buy cheap.  Of course the question of why a </p><p>country like Yemen -- among the world\'s 25 poorest, with </p><p>annual per capita income around $400 -- would buy a useless </p><p>weapons system like the SCUD (or Russian MIGs for that </p><p>matter) at any price is often posed by international donors, </p><p>and Yemen has no convincing answer.  The 11/02 interdiction </p><p>of the So San with its cargo of SCUD-Bs underscored such </p><p>questions and prompted several donors (particularly the </p><p>Japanese) to suspend aid until the ROYG offered assurance </p><p>that those SCUDs would be the last. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Those assurances, conveyed in similar terms to both </p><p>Japan and the USG, fall short of the simple and categoric </p><p>language we sought to elicit.  The most recent Yemeni </p><p>statement on this -- a 3/5/03 letter from Aliwa -- stated </p><p>that existing contracts with the DPRK for spares/ </p><p>maintenance, as well as construction of a naval port near </p><p>Hodeidah, would be implemented.  We have seen no recent </p><p>indication of movement on either, and have strongly urged the </p><p>Yemenis to refrain from both. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The ROYG has invited the USG to propose an affordable </p><p>alternative to the DPRK.  We have urged the Rumanians (the </p><p>best established of the East Europeans in Yemen) to use their </p><p>extensive port-building experience to undercut the DPRK. </p><p>They are interested, but have bad memories of unpaid bills </p><p>for construction here in the early 90\'s.  AMB Hull has </p><p>discussed with you the possibility of dangling expected </p><p>supplemental FMF as assistance toward responsible military </p><p>procurement. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Article 98 </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) U.S. military assistance is vital for Yemen, so our </p><p>leverage on the ICC/Article 98 issue is considerable.  The </p><p>fact that other Arab states have taken the plunge on Article </p><p>98 is also an important consideration for the Yemenis, who </p><p>are hesitant to step ahead of their Gulf neighbors on any </p><p>potentially sensitive issue.  The ROYG has signed, but not </p><p>ratified, the Rome Statute; and we have ensured that the </p><p>Yemeni leadership is aware that ratification without an </p><p>Article 98 agreement in place would precipitate a cut-off of </p><p>FMF. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The ROYG put off consideration of an Article 98 </p><p>agreement for many months in the run-up to the April 27 </p><p>parliamentary elections.  Since then we have worked the issue </p><p>hard with the MFA, which has been responsive.  FM Qirbi is </p><p>interested in pursuing an exchange of diplomatic notes based </p><p>on the Egyptian precedent, and we have encouraged this. </p><p>President Saleh\'s approval is required, and we believe Qirbi </p><p>is hoping for presidential authorization to proceed in time </p><p>for your visit. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Humanitarian Demining </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) You will pay a brief visit to Yemen,s National Mine </p><p>Action Committee.  With U.S. guidance, the ROYG began a </p><p>humanitarian demining program in 1998.  Sixty percent of all </p><p>marked areas have been cleared of mines and UXO, including 10 </p><p>out of 14 "high impact" areas.  Despite Yemen\'s poverty, the </p><p>program is widely recognized as one of the best managed and </p><p>most successful in the world. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) There is an issue here.  The USG has been the largest </p><p>contributor to the program, but FY03 NADR funds -- $750,000 </p><p>-- have not yet been released as the June 30 deadline looms. </p><p>The program provides humanitarian benefit to the rural poor, </p><p>and has helped anchor bilateral CT cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Security of Radioactive Materials </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Yemen\'s National Atomic Energy Commission -- led by </p><p>U.S.-educated Moustafa Bahran -- is surprisingly active and </p><p>supportive of U.S. positions in international fora.  Bahran\'s </p><p>main initiative is a proposal to enhance the physical </p><p>security of radiological materials.  The Republic of Yemen, </p><p>in cooperation with the United States and the EU, co-drafted </p><p>and co-sponsored the final resolution in the 2002 IAEA </p><p>conference on preventing the use of radioactive materials for </p><p>terror.  Bahran looks forward to meeting you. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>10. (C) Foreign Minister Qirbi </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>In his second term as Foreign Minister, Dr. Abu Bakr al-Qirbi </p><p>(a physician by background) has worked to advance Yemen\'s </p><p>return to a responsible foreign policy, although he is not </p><p>inclined to take bold steps that might alienate Arab or </p><p>Muslim opinion.  Both he and Saleh were cautious in public </p><p>expressions of opposition to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and </p><p>Qirbi privately told us many times he welcomed the removal of </p><p>Saddam Hussein.  Qirbi has strongly endorsed the </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian Road Map and publicly praised President </p><p>Bush for launching the initiative.  He is UK-educated and </p><p>speaks fluent English. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>11. (C) Defense Minister Aliwa </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>Major General Abdullah Ali Aliwa has served both as a soldier </p><p>and as the civilian governor of a poor province.  He is </p><p>anxious to strengthen military cooperation with the U.S.  He </p><p>does not take the lead on international policy issues, </p><p>however, and will defer to the Minister of Foreign Affairs on </p><p>Article 98 and, to a lesser degree, cooperation with North </p><p>Korea.  He may raise the ROYG\'s program to buy back MANPADS </p><p>as in indicator of Yemen\'s CT commitment.  He speaks limited </p><p>English and will prefer to converse in Arabic. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
