<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002465 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/12 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, ECIN, VM, KPRP, APEC, CTERR </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM: APEC OCTOBER MEETING (C-AL2-00879) </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 184827 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CLAIRE A. PIERANGELO, ECONOMIC </p><p> </p><p>COUNSELOR.  REASON 1.5 (C). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  POST HAS HAD A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS WITH GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS REGARDING APEC AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02465  01 OF 02  100745Z </p><p>VIETNAM\'S ROLE.  WHILE VIETNAM IS WORKING HARD TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN MORE APEC ACTIVITIES, IT IS HAMPERED BY ITS </p><p>SEVERE PERSONNEL AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS AS WELL AS A </p><p>CHRONIC LACK OF "DEEP THINKING" AT SENIOR-MOST LEVELS.  WE </p><p>FIND IT A VERY DIFFERENT STORY AT THE GVN\'S WORKING LEVEL, </p><p>BUT DO NOT SEE THAT ENERGY AND CREATIVE THOUGHT PROCESS </p><p>TRANSLATING INTO OVERALL GVN POLICY ON APEC - YET. </p><p>OVERALL, DECISION-MAKING WITHIN THE GVN REMAINS VERY MUCH </p><p>TOP-DOWN AND CONSENSUS-BASED, FURTHER LIMITING THE GVN\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO RESPOND TO -- MUCH LESS PROPOSE -- NEW </p><p>INITIATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE PRIMARY GOAL FOR VIETNAM AT THE UPCOMING </p><p>OCTOBER MEETING IS TO GET APEC AGREEMENT FOR VIETNAM TO </p><p>HOST APEC IN 2006.   VIETNAM\'S LONG-TERM GOAL FOR ALL APEC </p><p>MEETINGS IS TO USE THE APEC PROCESS TO FURTHER DOMESTIC </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM GOALS (CAPACITY BUILDING) AND ITS BROADER </p><p>OBJECTIVE OF MULTI-LATERALIZING AND DIVERSIFYING ITS </p><p>FOREIGN RELATIONS AS WELL AS INCREASING REGIONAL ECONOMIC </p><p>INTEGRATION.  IN MANY WAYS, VIETNAM STILL SEES APEC AS ONE- </p><p>WAY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE STREET; CHANGING THAT ATTITUDE </p><p>WILL BE DIFFICULT.   LEADING UP TO 2006, THE GVN HAS A </p><p>SPECIFIC POLICY OF HOSTING A NUMBER OF VARIOUS WORKING </p><p>GROUP MEETINGS EVERY YEAR AS PREPARATION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICIALS, ASEAN HAS TOLD </p><p>VIETNAM THAT IT IS VIETNAM\'S TURN TO HOST IN 2006 AND THE </p><p>GVN IS TREATING IT VIRTUALLY AS A DONE DEAL.  SOME MOFA </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE CHARACTERIZED VIETNAM\'S DESIRE TO HOST IN </p><p>2006 PARTIALLY AS VIETNAM\'S "DUTY" AS AN ASEAN MEMBER AND </p><p>PARTIALLY AS VIETNAM\'S "DUE."  VIETNAM WILL WANT TO USE THE </p><p>OCCASION TO RECONFIRM 20 YEARS OF "DOI MOI" (ECONOMIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02465  01 OF 02  100745Z </p><p>RENOVATION), AND RECONFIRM ITS POLICY OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC </p><p>INTEGRATION.  ACCORDING TO MINISTRY OF TRADE OFFICIALS, </p><p>ASEAN ACTUALLY TRIED TO CONVINCE VIETNAM TO HOST IN 2003 </p><p>AND THE GVN HAD BEEN CONSIDERING IT.  HOWEVER, MOT AND </p><p>OTHER MINISTRIES OPPOSED THAT DATE, NOTING THAT VIETNAM WAS </p><p>ALREADY HOSTING THE SOUTH-EAST ASIAN GAMES AND WAS NOT </p><p>READY TO TAKE ON SUCH AN EXPENSIVE CHALLENGE.   SOME </p><p>WORKING LEVEL CONTACTS AT MOT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (THE </p><p>BUDGET MASTERS) CONTINUE TO QUESTION WHETHER VIETNAM WILL </p><p>BE READY INTERNALLY TO HANDLE HOSTING APEC FROM FINANCIAL, </p><p>PERSONNEL AND SUBSTANTIVE PERSPECTIVES.   ADMINISTRATIVELY, </p><p>HOWEVER, FEW QUESTION VIETNAM\'S ABILITY TO MEET THE </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGE.  BUT QUESTIONS DO REMAIN ABOUT </p><p>WHETHER GVN LEADERS WILL USE THE OCCASION SIMPLY TO </p><p>CONGRATULATE THEMSELVES FOR PAST REFORMS, OR TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>PUSH THROUGH CURRENT AND FUTURE REFORMS IN ORDER TO </p><p>SHOWCASE REAL RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ACCORDING TO MOFA AND MOT OFFICIALS, VIETNAM FEELS </p><p>THAT MEXICO IS DOING AS GOOD A JOB AS IS POSSIBLE UNDER </p><p>"THE CIRCUMSTANCES" -- "MEXICO IS TRYING HARD, BUT THE </p><p>PROBLEM IS NOT MEXICO, IT\'S APEC."   THEY RESERVED THEIR </p><p>STRONG CRITICISM FOR THE APEC SECRETARIAT STAFF.  MOT IN </p><p>PARTICULAR HAS BEEN UNHAPPY WITH THE APEC SECRETARIAT AND </p><p>FEELS THAT THE STAFF NEEDS TO BE MORE PROFESSIONAL AS WELL </p><p>AS DO A BETTER JOB AT SCHEDULING MEETINGS AND IN REIGNING </p><p>IN MEMBERS REGARDING LAST MINUTE PROPOSALS, WHICH LEAVE </p><p>LITTLE TIME FOR MEMBERS TO STUDY THEM ON A SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>BASIS.  (THIS IS PARTICULARLY A PROBLEM FOR VIETNAM, WHICH </p><p>NORMALLY NEEDS ADDITIONAL STUDY TIME ON ANY ISSUE, NO </p><p>MATTER HOW MINOR.)   MOFA AND MOT OFFICIALS AGREED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02465  01 OF 02  100745Z </p><p>THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE APEC MEETINGS BECOME MORE </p><p>FOCUSED, WITH FEWER AND BETTER INITIATIVES.  VIETNAMESE </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE CLEARLY FEELING OVERWHELMED AT THE VOLUME OF </p><p>INITIATIVES WHICH IS AT A LEVEL BEYOND THEIR CAPACITY TO </p><p>REVIEW AND EVALUATE THEM ALL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS ARE POSITIVE REGARDING </p><p>MEXICO\'S THEME AND NOTED NO REAL CONTENTIOUS ISSUES, WITH </p><p>THE EXCEPTION OF POSSIBLE DIFFICULTIES REGARDING TIMING </p><p>ISSUES FOR REQUIREMENTS FOR CT INITIATIVES (SEE BELOW). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE GVN SHARES OUR COUNTER-TERRORISM CONCERNS BUT </p><p>HAS RAISED REAL CONCERNS ABOUT ITS OWN ABILITY TO CARRY OUT </p><p>A NUMBER OF THE PROPOSED ACTIONS UNDER STAR.   THERE IS AN </p><p>HONEST LACK OF PERSONNEL, RESOURCES, AND TRAINING THAT </p><p>POSES DIFFICULTIES.  THE GVN WILL PUSH FOR LONGER DEADLINES </p><p>FOR ITSELF AND OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  IT MAY WELL </p><p>PUSH TO TAKE A PATHFINDER APPROACH TO THE STAR (AND OTHER) </p><p>CT INITIATIVES.  IT WILL PUSH FOR THE U.S. AND OTHER </p><p>DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO ATTACH SPECIFIC OFFERS OF </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE VARIOUS CT ACTION ITEMS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE GVN OFFICIALLY SUPPORTS APEC ACTIONS THAT </p><p>SUPPORT THE BOGOR GOALS BUT HAS NOT REALLY ARTICULATED WHAT </p><p>THAT MEANS IN PRACTICAL ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2722 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02465  02 OF 02  100745Z </p><p>ACTION INR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AIT-03   AMAD-00  CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   OIGO-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  TEDE-00  LAB-01 </p><p>      MMP-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIG-03   SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  EPAE-00  DSCC-00  LBA-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /016W </p><p>                  ------------------F4DEDB  100807Z /38 </p><p>R 100741Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7765 </p><p>INFO APEC COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002465 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) REGARDING THE LEADERS\' MEETINGS, WE HAVE HEARD NO </p><p>CRITICISM FROM THE TOP LEVELS OF THE GVN, BUT AT THE </p><p>WORKING LEVEL, OFFICIALS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE QUANTITY OF </p><p> </p><p>WORK INVOLVED AND THAT THE MEETINGS HAVE "TOO MUCH SHOW AND </p><p>NOT ENOUGH SUBSTANCE." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  SENIOR LEVEL GVN OFFICIALS PRAISE APEC AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02465  02 OF 02  100745Z </p><p>VIETNAM\'S PARTICIPATION IN IT, BUT HAVE HAD LITTLE </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE COMMENT ON THE FUTURE DIRECTION FOR THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OR ITS MANAGEMENT.  IT WORKS FOR THEM, </p><p>APPARENTLY.  HOWEVER, AT THE WORKING LEVEL, WE HAVE HEARD </p><p>SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING THE INCREDIBLY BROAD REACH OF </p><p>APEC -- "SO MANY ISSUES, SO MANY PROPOSALS, AND NO TIME TO </p><p>DEAL WITH THEM."   MOT OFFICIALS HAVE COMMENTED THAT </p><p>MEMBERS ARE SO OVERWHELMED THAT THEY JUST APPROVE </p><p>INITIATIVES BECAUSE IT\'S EASIER THAN ACTUALLY READING THE </p><p>DOCUMENTS AND DEBATING THE ISSUES.  THEY HAVE ALSO </p><p>COMPLAINED THAT THE RESULT IS THAT NO ONE FEELS COMPELLED </p><p>ACTUALLY TO IMPLEMENT THE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THEIR OWN </p><p>GOVERNMENT (THEY HAVE SOMETIMES HAD THE SAME COMPLAINT ABOUT </p><p>ASEAN). </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  GVN OFFICIALS ARE RETICENT TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE </p><p>OF THE PRC\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TAIPEI IN APEC BEYOND THE </p><p>GVN\'S OFT-STATED "ONE CHINA" POLICY AND ITS AGREEMENT THAT </p><p>APEC IS NOT A POLITICAL FORUM AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AS </p><p>SUCH. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) MOFA AND MOT OFFICIALS ARE "POSITIVE" BUT NON- </p><p>COMMITTAL REGARDING APEC FTAS.  IN THEORY, THEY AGREE THAT </p><p>IT IS DESIRABLE TO WORK TOWARD FTAS IN APEC, BUT IN </p><p>REALITY, THE GVN WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING ANY SUCH </p><p>COMMITMENTS AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  THE GVN IS IN FAVOR OF THE PATHFINDER INITIATIVE </p><p>BECAUSE IT ALLOWS VIETNAM TO OPT OUT OF TECHNICALLY OR </p><p>POLITICALLY DIFFICULT INITIATIVES.  AT THE SAME TIME, GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS WORRY THAT TOO MANY INITIATIVES WILL GO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02465  02 OF 02  100745Z </p><p>PATHFINDER WAY AND VIETNAM WILL BE LEFT EVEN FURTHER </p><p>BEHIND.  THE GVN WILL LIKELY PUSH FOR A "SPECIFIC PLAN" </p><p>THAT LAYS OUT POSSIBLE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT OPT OUT OF PATHFINDER INITIATIVES, ALLOWING </p><p>THEM TO CATCH UP IN A REASONABLE TIME PERIOD. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  THE VIETNAMESE DELEGATION TO THE OCTOBER MEETINGS </p><p>WILL BE LED BY PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI, AND INCLUDE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN, DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE </p><p>LE DANH VINH AND OTHER LOWER LEVEL OFFICIALS WORKING ON APEC ISSUES. </p><p>THE GVN HAS REPEATEDLY REQUESTED A BILAT WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH BUT UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN, APART </p><p>FROM THE PROXIMITY OF THE PRESIDENT AND PRIME MINISTER AT </p><p>THE DINNER AND LUNCH FOR LEADERS (AT WHICH A WHISPER </p><p>INTERPRETER WILL BE ALLOWED THIS YEAR, UNLIKE IN SHANGHAI). </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
