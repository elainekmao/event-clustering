<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 001905 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 20 (3/31 1200 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Embassy is operating on a normal schedule March </p><p>31.  Consular services are open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center remain suspended, and there is only </p><p>restricted activity by FSN\'s at the Peace Corps office. </p><p>Movements of American staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Consular section began receiving phone calls asking </p><p>whether the Embassy is open to receiving Iraqi applications </p><p>for refugee status.  Callers are being told that "all refugee </p><p>applications must first be approved by UNHCR before any </p><p>receiving country can consider granting such status." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Approximately 1:00 a.m. local time, Michael </p><p>Birmingham, (Voices in the Wilderness, Chicago) telephoned </p><p>the Embassy to say that his friend Ramzi Kysia, reportedly a </p><p>U.S. citizen, with "Voices of the Wilderness" had departed </p><p>Baghdad on Sunday, 3/30 at 9:00 a.m. by car for Jordan and </p><p>had not been heard from since.  Mr. Birmingham said he had </p><p>checked with the UN relief agencies working at the border and </p><p>they did not think Mr. Kysia had crossed.  Mr. Birmingham </p><p>said he would advise Embassy when he hears from his friend. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Eight peace activists are staying in the Hotel Monzer </p><p>in the Abdali section of Amman.  They plan to depart for the </p><p>U.S. on Tuesday.  One activist, Mr. Weldon Nisly, is </p><p>currently in the hospital and may not be able to travel.  If </p><p>he does not travel, one other member of the group will remain </p><p>with him.  Consular Section and RMO visited him March 31. </p><p>The eight Amcits are: Leah Wilson, Margaret Gish, Shane </p><p>Clayborne, Betty Scholten, Clifford Kindy, Kara McGill, </p><p>Weldon Nisly, and Johnathan Hartgrove. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  During a visit to the Public Security Division (PSD), </p><p>Petra news agency reports that King Abdullah II hailed PSD </p><p>for its work "in keeping the citizens\' security and the </p><p>homeland\'s stability," and reiterated respect for freedom of </p><p>expression in Jordan.  The King pointed out that the </p><p>Jordanian people\'s expressions of feelings about Iraq have </p><p>been "conscious and responsible," embodying Jordan\'s "angry </p><p>stand" on the consequences of the war on Iraq for civilians </p><p>and in solidarity with them. (Ref FBIS GMP200330030000178) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Petra news agency reported that on Sunday Jordanian </p><p>journalists condemned the "American-British invasion against </p><p>Iraq."  The demonstration organized by the Press Association </p><p>expressed support for Iraq "in the face of the vicious attack </p><p>which claims the lives of hundreds of unarmed civilians." </p><p>(Ref FBIS GMP200330030000175)  The item did not report how </p><p>many people attended the demonstration. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) There were a few small, non-violent gatherings in the </p><p>city March 30, with a couple of gatherings scheduled for last </p><p>evening.  No violence was anticipated with these known </p><p>gatherings.  There was a candlelight vigil held by 100 - 200 </p><p>women at the UN offices.  100 press members marched to a </p><p>press office near Jordan University.  Additionally, 700 </p><p>people demonstrated at the Professional Associations Complex, </p><p>but did not leave that complex. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  Queen Alia International Airport Director Nasri </p><p>Nowar reported that two planeloads (747s) of humanitarian aid </p><p>from Japan will arrive at the airport March 31.  Nowar said </p><p>the Japanese Embassy was playing the event up as a photo op </p><p>with 60 Japanese journalists and the Ambassador of Japan </p><p>expected to be in attendance.  He also said that Royal </p><p>Jordanian flights to the United States will continue to </p><p>operate once or twice per week, depending on loads, and that </p><p>service to Europe both by RJ and European carriers was still </p><p>running, albeit at reduced levels. </p><p>9. (SBU)  The Amman Stock Exchange was down slightly by .36% </p><p>on lower trading March 30.  Banking sector contacts said </p><p>business was normal and emphasized, alluding to reports of </p><p>unusual activity in the Saudi banking sector, that there were </p><p>"no indications or suggestions" of capital flight in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  Contrary to local press reports, Jordan Telecom </p><p>(JT) has not reestablished telephone links with Iraq via </p><p>alternative satellite routes.  JT Director of Marketing </p><p>Olivier Faure said that, although the company had attempted </p><p>to reroute calls through a number of different telecom </p><p>providers (including MCI in the U.S. and British Telecom in </p><p>the U.K.), it had not yet been successful.  Faure was not </p><p>optimistic that connections would be established in the short </p><p>term, given what he termed "the obvious damage" to the Iraqi </p><p>fixed-line network, judging by the "ever-increasing" number </p><p>of complaints by customers unable to reach friends and family </p><p>in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) A QIZ company manager said that one of his major </p><p>clients, accounting for half of his production, cancelled </p><p>April orders due to the war.  He said another client asked </p><p>him to put a confirmed May order on hold.  Embassy/Econ </p><p>informed him of Embassy and Washington activities related to </p><p>QIZ support during the crisis, and offered to contact his </p><p>buyers if he desired. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (S)  Military sources report that the two-truck MSF </p><p>convoy has been located.  According to MSF, the trucks had </p><p>been held at the Iraqi side of the Jordan-Iraq border since </p><p>Wednesday, March 28 (no further details on why the trucks had </p><p>been held).  The convoy reportedly left the Iraqi side of the </p><p>border at 1200 yesterday (local time) and was expected to </p><p>reach Baghdad by nightfall yesterday.  Iraqi customs and </p><p>immigration officials continue to staff the border post on </p><p>the Iraqi side. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  IOM reports that 26 TCNs crossed into Jordan from </p><p>Iraq overnight (March 30-31).  Nine of them reportedly have </p><p>document problems and are being held at no-man\'s land at the </p><p>border.  An elderly Iraqi couple with health problems who </p><p>seek permission to transit Jordan en route to Bahrain also </p><p>are awaiting permission to enter Jordan.  UNHCR believes GOJ </p><p>authorities will allow the couple to tranist Jordan.  IOM </p><p>reports that a significant and ever-changing number of Somali </p><p>and Sudanese nationals continue to insist that they do not </p><p>want to return to their countries of origin.  The Somali and </p><p>Sudanese nationals are long-term residents of Iraq (15 - 20 </p><p>years) who claim that they have no remaining ties to their </p><p>home countries or any means of supporting themselves there - </p><p>- or, in some cases, even getting back to their home </p><p>villages.  IOM cannot forcibly repatriate these TCNs, nor can </p><p>it offer any assistance (repatriation packages, etc.) to help </p><p>convince them to go home.  UNHCR is interviewing everyone who </p><p>says they don\'t want to return home but so far has not found </p><p>that anyone meets UNHCR criteria for refugee status.  As long </p><p>as the total transit camp population remains manageable </p><p>(total population hovers around 250 right now, as IOM is </p><p>making plans to repatriate people in small groups), IOM and </p><p>the Jordan Red Crescent believe they can provide a minimal, </p><p>acceptable level of care for the TCN population for the </p><p>foreseeable future.  Without having been out to the camp, </p><p>Embassy Refugee Coordinator suspects that many of these </p><p>Somalis and Sudanese are hoping to wait out the war here in </p><p>Jordan and then return to their homes/jobs in Iraq after some </p><p>degree of stability has returned to Iraq.  So far, all of the </p><p>relevant players - - including the GOJ - - seem inclined to </p><p>let them wait it out, but it is not clear how long that will </p><p>be true. </p><p>14. (C)  Another emerging protection question is the status </p><p>of Palestinians trying to enter Jordan.  18 Palestinians </p><p>without any travel documentation were admitted to the transit </p><p>camp in Ruweished, but UNHCR reports that over the last two </p><p>days, two separate groups of stateless Palestinians (total of </p><p>11 individuals) held overnight in no-man\'s land were </p><p>"persuaded" by GOJ authorities to return to Iraq.  UNHCR is </p><p>starting to suspect that these were not voluntary returns. </p><p>The GOJ has made it very clear to everyone involved that it </p><p>will not allow Palestinians to enter Jordan, but need to find </p><p>a way to care for stateless Palestinians until it is safe for </p><p>them to return to their homes in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
