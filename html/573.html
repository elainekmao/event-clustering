WE ARE FRANKLY APPALLED BY THE THRICE-REPEATED </p><p>CLAIM IN REF A THAT THE EVENTS IN AND AROUND PROZOR </p><p>OVER 6 WEEKS AGO CONSTITUTE HARD EVIDENCE OF PAST AND </p><p>LIKELY FUTURE CROATIAN ETHNIC CLEANSING IN BOSNIA. </p><p>FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT, THIS PERSISTENT ALLEGATION </p><p>IS DANGEROUSLY DISTRACTING.  AND PLAINLY INACCURATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02586  01 OF 03  041600Z </p><p>IN FACT.  END SUMMARY COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE ARE TROUBLED BY THE IMPLICATION THROUGHOUT </p><p>REF A THAT THE FLIGHT OF ANY NUMBER OF PERSONS OF ANY </p><p>ETHNIC GROUP IN B-H UNDER ANY ACTUAL OR FEARED THREAT </p><p>FROM MEMBERS OF ANY OTHER ETHNIC GROUP CONSTITUTES, </p><p>IPSO FACTO, "ETHNIC CLEANSING."  TO APPLY THIS VERY </p><p>EVOCATIVE TERM IN SUCH A MANNER IN OUR VIEW DEBASES </p><p>ITS CONSIDERABLE USEFULNESS.  THROUGHOUT THE LONG, </p><p>WRENCHING SAGA OF YUGOSLAVIA\'S BREAKUP, THE LEAP FROM </p><p>SIMPLE RECOGNITION THAT NO SIDE IS WITHOUT BLAME TO </p><p>THE POLICY-STULTIFYING CONCLUSION OF VIRTUAL MORAL </p><p>EQUIVALENCE HAS BEEN MADE FAR TOO OFTEN AND TOO </p><p>QUICKLY.  AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND, WE LAUD THE FACT </p><p>THAT USG SPOKESMEN HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR </p><p>ABOUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR "ETHNIC CLEANSING" IN </p><p>BOSNIA.  AND WE THINK THE USG CAN TAKE PRIDE IN THE </p><p>LEADING ROLE IT HAS PLAYED BOTH IN PUSHING FOR A WAR </p><p>CRIMES TRIBUNAL TO IDENTIFY THE GUILTY (ON ANY SIDE) </p><p>AND IN ASSEMBLING EVIDENCE TO ASSIST IN THAT PROCESS. </p><p>CONTINUATION OF THIS USG CLEAR-HEADEDNESS WILL BE </p><p>VITAL, WE BELIEVE, IF WE ARE TO COUNTER REPORTED </p><p>SIGNALS FROM LORD OWEN, AMONG OTHERS, THAT TALK OF </p><p>WAR CRIMES TRIBUNALS MAY NEED TO BE MUTED IN THE </p><p>INTEREST OF FOSTERING POLITICAL COMPROMISE IN B-H </p><p>INVOLVING POTENTIALLY GUILTY PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US, IT IS </p><p>THE CONCLUSION OF ALL INTERESTED ELEMENTS OF THIS </p><p>EMBASSY THAT CROATIAN FORCES IN BOSNIA HAVE NOT </p><p>ENGAGED IN ETHNIC CLEANSING -- EITHER AS A MATTER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02586  01 OF 03  041600Z </p><p>POLICY DIRECTED BY SENIOR LEADERS OR AS A WIDESPREAD </p><p>PRACTICE ON THE GROUND.
