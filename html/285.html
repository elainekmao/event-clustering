<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 MOSCOW 15118 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UR, IR, IZ, AF </p><p>SUBJECT: SOVIET REACTION TO KHOMEINI\'S DEATH </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A) MOSCOW 14076,  (B) STATE 176500 </p><p> </p><p>1. C-ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>/------- </p><p> </p><p>2. KHOMEINI\'S DEATH EVOKES IN THE MINDS OF SOVIETS </p><p>THE DEATH OF STALIN.  PERHAPS SIMPLY BECAUSE STALIN </p><p>IS ON EVERYONE\'S MINDS THESE DAYS AS THE CONGRESS OF </p><p>PEOPLE\'S DEPUTIES REVIEWS PAST CRIMES, SOVIET </p><p>CONTACTS IN TWO SEPARATE MEETINGS WITH EMBOFFS </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY BROUGHT UP THE DEAD SOVIET DICTATOR IN </p><p>DESCRIBING THE CURRENT SITUATION IN IRAN: STALIN THE </p><p>COMPROMISE CHOICE FOR LEADER FOLLOWING LENIN\'S DEATH </p><p>(LIKE KHAMENEI NOW); AND STALIN THE GIANT HISTORICAL </p><p>FIGURE WHOSE SHOES NO MORTAL COULD EVER FILL (LIKE </p><p>THE NOW-DEPARTED KHOMEINI). </p><p> </p><p>3. OUR CONTACTS SUGGEST THE SOVIETS DO NOT EXPECT ANY </p><p>SUDDEN CHANGES IN IRANIAN POLICY, WITH REGARD TO </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS, IRAN-IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN.  BUT </p><p>THE SOVIETS DO APPEAR TO HOPE FOR A MORE PRAGMATIC </p><p>IRANIAN APPROACH TO EMERGE EVENTUALLY.  ONE CONTACT </p><p>RAISED THE INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY THAT A DEBATE IS </p><p>UNDERWAY CONCERNING HOW EAGERLY THE SOVIETS SHOULD </p><p>PURSUE IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH IRAN.  FOR THE MOMENT </p><p>THE SOVIET DESIRE FOR FULL NORMALIZATION REMAINS </p><p>OFFICIAL POLICY, HOWEVER.  THE RAFSANJANI VISIT MAY </p><p>WELL BE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF THE MOURNING PERIOD, BUT </p><p>NO WORD HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM IRAN ON THIS.  THE </p><p>SOVIETS STILL DEFEND PROSPECTIVE ARMS SALES TO IRAN. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4. EMBASSY OFFICERS MET JUNE 7 WITH MFA MIDDLE </p><p>EASTERN COUNTRIES ADMINISTRATION IRAN SECTOR OFFICIAL </p><p>VADIM NAZAROV AND "IZVESTIYA" DEPUTY MIDDLE EAST </p><p>EDITOR ANDREY OSTALSKIY TO DISCUSS SOVIET REACTIONS </p><p>TO THE DEATH OF KHOMEINI. </p><p> </p><p>THE STALIN IMAGE </p><p>/----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. BOTH NAZAROV AND OSTALSKIY, INDEPENDENTLY, FOUND </p><p>THEMSELVES DRAWING ON THE IMAGE OF STALIN TO DESCRIBE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE WAKE OF KHOMEINI\'S DEATH. </p><p>NAZAROV COMPARED THE SELECTION OF KHAMENEI TO SUCCEED </p><p>THE AYATOLLAH AS IRAN\'S SPIRITUAL LEADER TO STALIN\'S </p><p>SELECTION AS THE COMPROMISE CANDIDATE OVER OTHER, </p><p>MORE FACTIONALIZED RIVALS FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF </p><p>LENIN.  OSTALSKIY COMPARED THE REACTION OF THE </p><p>IRANIAN PEOPLE TO KHOMEINI\'S DEATH TO THAT OF THE </p><p>SOVIET PEOPLE FOLLOWING STALIN\'S DEMISE.  OSTALSKIY </p><p>SAID THAT, AS WITH STALIN, THERE WOULD AT FIRST BE A </p><p>PERIOD OF INTENSE MOURNING OVER KHOMEINI--"BUT LATER </p><p>WOULD COME A RE-EVALUATION".  OSTALSKIY SUGGESTED THE </p><p>SOVIETS WERE HOPING THIS RE-EVALUATION WOULD RESULT </p><p>IN THE ADOPTION OF A MORE PRAGMATIC COURSE BY THE </p><p>IRANIAN LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>REACTIONS, PERSONAL AND OFFICIAL </p><p>/------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. NAZAROV SUGGESTED THAT, SPEAKING PERSONALLY, HE </p><p>AND MANY SOVIETS WERE NOT SORRY TO SEE KHOMEINI </p><p>DEPART THE SCENE.  KHOMEINI\'S REGIME HAD DESTROYED </p><p>MANY LIVES AND VIOLATED MANY STANDARDS OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>7. THE OFFICIAL S0VIET REACTION, HOWEVER--WHICH HAD </p><p>TO TAKE SOVIET INTERESTS INTO ACCOUNT--NATURALLY </p><p>CONSISTED OF OFFERING CONDOLENCES TO IRAN, NAZAROV </p><p>SAID.  GORBACHEV SENT A SHORT MESSAGE TO KHAMENEI </p><p>(PUBLISHED AT THE BOTTOM OF FRONT PAGE OF THE JUNE 7 </p><p>"PRAVDA"), AND SHEVARDNADZE AND FIRST DEPUTY CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE SUPREME SOVIET LUK\'YANOV SIGNED THE CONDOLENCE </p><p>BOOK AT THE IRANIAN EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>IRAN DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>/---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. IT WAS VERY HARD TO PREDICT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT </p><p>INSIDE IRAN, NAZAROV SAID.  KHOMEINI HAD BEEN THE </p><p>ONLY IRANIAN POLITICAL FIGURE WHO EXERCIZED A </p><p>CONSISTENT LINE.  THE FLIRTING WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD </p><p>WHICH OTHER LEADERS HAD ENGAGED IN WOULD RE-EMERGE, </p><p>BUT WHETHER IT WOULD LAST REMAINED UNPREDICTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE CHOICE OF KHAMENEI AS KHOMEINI\'S SUCCESSOR HAD </p><p>BEEN TACTICAL, NAZAROV SAID, REPRESENTING A </p><p>COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE RADICAL SPIRITUAL LEADERS AND </p><p>THE PRAGMATISTS.  IN ACCEPTING A LEADERSHIP ROLE, </p><p>THOUGH, KHAMENEI WAS TAKING A RISK: WHEREAS IRANIANS </p><p>HAD NOT BEEN WILLING TO CRITICIZE KHOMEINI\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE COUNTRY, THERE WAS EVERY CHANCE </p><p>THAT THEIR PENT-UP FRUSTRATIONS WOULD NOW BE </p><p>UNLEASHED ON A LESS-IDOLIZED LEADER LIKE KHAMENEI. </p><p> </p><p>10. KHAMENEI WAS TIED TO THE BAZAARIS, NAZAROV SAID, </p><p>AND HAD CALLED FOR REDUCED GOVERNMENTAL INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN COMMERCIAL LIFE.  LIKEWISE, HE HAD--AS SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL OF THE "PARTY OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC"--AT </p><p>ONE TIME CALLED FOR A REDUCED POLITICAL ROLE FOR THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP.  KHAMENEI HAD ALSO </p><p>HELPED CREATE THE 25-MEMBER CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW </p><p>COUNCIL WHICH WAS PROPOSING TO EXPAND THE POWERS OF </p><p>THE PRESIDENCY AND ABOLISH THE POST OF PRIME </p><p>MINISTER.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, NAZAROV </p><p>SUGGESTED, KHAMENEI APPEARED TO FAVOR RAFSANJANI\'S </p><p>ELECTION TO THE POST OF A MORE POWERFUL PRESIDENCY, </p><p>THEREBY FACILITATING IRAN\'S RETURN TO A MORE </p><p>PRAGMATIC, LESS SPIRITUALLY-INFLUENCED APPROACH.  BUT </p><p>MUCH DEPENDED ON WHEN THE COUNCIL WOULD MAKE ITS </p><p>DECISIONS CONCERNING THE POWERS OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY--NAZAROV COULD NOT ESTIMATE WHEN THIS </p><p>WOULD BE--AND IN ANY CASE, AS RAFSANJANI\'S CALL FOR </p><p>THE DEATHS OF AMERICANS HAD DEMONSTRATED, THE ACTIONS </p><p>OF EVEN A "MODERATE" IRANIAN POLICIAL FIGURE WERE </p><p>ENTIRELY UNPREDICTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN RELATIONS </p><p>/----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. WHAT REMAINED CONSTANT, NAZAROV SAID, WAS IRAN\'S </p><p>DESPERATE NEED FOR FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO EMERGE FROM </p><p>ITS ECONOMIC CRISIS.  MUCH OF THIS ASSISTANCE COULD </p><p>ONLY COME FROM THE WEST, AS THE SOVIET UNION SIMPLY </p><p>DID NOT HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO PROVIDE IT.  THE </p><p>SOVIETS WERE IN A POSITION, HOWEVER, TO BUY IRANIAN </p><p>NATURAL GAS AND TO OFFER TRANSPORTATION ROUTES FOR </p><p>THE GAS AND OTHER IRANIAN PRODUCTS. </p><p> </p><p>12. BECAUSE THE SOVIETS WERE NOT PRESENTLY PERCEIVED </p><p>AS A MAJOR THREAT BY IRAN, NAZAROV SAID, THE IRANIANS </p><p>WERE ALSO INTERESTED IN RECEIVING AS MUCH POLITICAL </p><p>SUPPORT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE USSR.  THE "PRIMITIVE" </p><p>IRANIAN CONCEPTION OF FOREIGN RELATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT </p><p>BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION--IN WHICH OTHER NATIONS </p><p>WERE EITHER FRIEND OR FOE-- WAS SLOWLY EVOLVING INTO </p><p>SOMETHING MORE SOPHISTICATED. </p><p> </p><p>RAFSANJANI VISIT </p><p>/--------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. NAZAROV SAID THE SOVIETS HAD RECEIVED NO WORD ON </p><p>WHETHER RAFSANJANI WOULD CANCEL OR POSTPONE HIS JUNE </p><p>21 VISIT TO MOSCOW.  GIVEN THAT DURING THE 40-DAY </p><p>PERIOD OF MOURNING A DEVOUT FOLLOWER OF KHOMEINI </p><p>WOULD BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT HOME AND GRIEVE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE WAS A CLEAR POSSIBILITY THAT THE VISIT </p><p>WOULD BE AT THE VERY LEAST POSTPONED, NAZAROV </p><p>INDICATED. </p><p> </p><p>DEFENSE COOPERATION </p><p>/------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14. IN A RECENT CONVERSATION, THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR </p><p>(PROTECT) TOLD EMBOFF THAT VORONTSOV\'S MAY 21 VISIT </p><p>TO TEHRAN HAD PRODUCED SUSPICIONS THAT A MUTUAL </p><p>DEFENSE AGREEMENT HAD BEEN SIGNED BETWEEN IRAN AND </p><p>THE USSR.  8UCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE OF TREMENDOUS </p><p>CONCERN TO THE IRAQIS, THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED, AND </p><p>HE WAS TO SEE MFA NEAR EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES ADMINI8TRATION CHIEF POLYAKOV JUNE 6 AT 4 </p><p>P.M. TO DISCUSS THE MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>15. ASKED ABOUT SOVIET-IRANIAN DEFENSE COOPERATION, </p><p>NAZAROV SAID THAT THE IRANIAN PRESS AGENCY STATEMENT </p><p>ON THE VORONTSOV VISIT TOOK LIBERTIES WITH REALITY. </p><p>THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE SOVIETS WERE </p><p>PREPARED TO COOPERATE WITH IRAN IN A VARIETY OF </p><p>SPHERES, WHICH WOULD NATURALLY INCLUDE MILITARY </p><p>COOPERATION AS WELL.  THIS IN NO WAY ENVISAGED A </p><p>MUTUAL DEFENSE AGREEMENT, NAZAROV SAID.  THE IRANIANS </p><p>STILL VIEWED THE SOVIETS AS TOO MUCH OF A THREAT FOR </p><p>THAT. </p><p> </p><p>16. ARMS SALES WERE ANOTHER MATTER, HOWEVER, AND HE </p><p>REITERATED ARGUMENTS OUTLINED IN REF (A) IN DEFENSE </p><p>OF SUCH SALES.  NAZAROV DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN WEAPONS </p><p>SUCH AS MISSILES, WHICH WOULD BE PROVOCATIVE, AND </p><p>FIELD ARTILLERY, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS HAVING </p><p>"LIMITED USES".  HE PROVIDED NO FURTHER CLUE AS TO </p><p>THE TIMING OF THE SALES, BUT ASSERTED THAT THE </p><p>RAFSANJANI VISIT WOULD BE "TOO SOON" BECAUSE SOVIET </p><p>PRODUCTION PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS WERE INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>IRAM-IRAQ </p><p>/-------- </p><p> </p><p>17. NAZAROV FORESAW NO IMMINENT CHANGE IN IRAN\'S </p><p>POLICY ON THE CONFLICT WITH IRAQ.  A MAJOR CONSTRAINT </p><p>UNDER WHICH ANY IRANIAN REGIME HAD TO OPERATE, HE </p><p>SUGGESTED, WAS THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IRAN\'S POLICY </p><p>ON TERRITORIAL DISPUTES WITH IRAQ DID NOT APPEAR </p><p>WEAKER THAN THAT OF THE SHAH, WHO HAD CONSOLIDATED </p><p>SOME OF IRAN\'S CLAIMS. </p><p> </p><p>AFGHANISTAN </p><p>/---------- </p><p> </p><p>18. IN A MOMENT OF FRANKNESS, NAZAROV CONCEDED THAT </p><p>THE IRANIANS WERE SPEAKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF THEIR </p><p>MOUTHS WITH REGARD TO THEIR AFGHAN POLICY.  IRAN WAS </p><p>TELLING THE SOVIETS THAT AN AFGHAN POLITICAL SOLUTION </p><p>HAD TO COMPRISE ALL POLITICAL FORCES IN THE COUNTRY, </p><p>WHEREAS THEY WERE TELLING THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE THAT </p><p>NAJIB HAD TO GO BEFORE A SETTLEMENT COULD BE </p><p>REACHED.  THE SOVIET VIEW REMAINED THAT NAJIB </p><p>INTENDED TO FIGHT TO THE BITTER END AND THAT ONLY A </p><p>DECISION TO INCLUDE HIM IN THE NEGOTIATIONS OFFERED </p><p>ANY HOPE FOR A SETTLEMENT.  THE ALLIANCE OF EIGHT, </p><p>HOWEVER, CONTINUED TO INSIST ON NAJIB\'S DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>SOVIET POLICY-MAKING ON IRAN </p><p>/--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. OSTALSKIY SUGGESTED THAT SOME SOVIET </p><p>OFFICIALS--INCLUDING CERTAIN DEPUTIES TO THE CONGRESS </p><p>OF PEOPLE\'S DEPUTIES FROM THE MOSCOW REGION--DID NOT </p><p>SHARE THE OFFICIAL VIEW THAT RELATIONS WITH IRAN </p><p>SHOULD BE FULLY NORMALIZED WHILE IRAN REMAINED </p><p>EMBARKED ON ITS REVOLUTIONARY COURSE.  HE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT SHEVARDNADZE HAD BEEN RELUCTANT TO MEET WITH </p><p>KHOMEINI LAST FEBRUARY, AND PREFERRED TO DEAL WITH </p><p>OTHER, "MORE NORMAL" MEMBERS OF THE IRANIAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>20. OSTALSKIY SAID HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO CALLED FOR </p><p>THE SOVIET UNION TO COORDINATE ITS APPROACH TO IRAN </p><p>WITH THE UNITED 8TATES.  HE ARGUED THAT IT WAS NOT IN </p><p>THE SOVIET INTEREST FOR U.S.-IRANIAN RELATIONS TO BE </p><p>ESTRANGED, AND THAT THE SOVIETS DID NOT INTEND TO </p><p>SEEK ADVANTAGE FROM THE PRESENT SITUATION.  OSTALSKIY </p><p>WOULD NOT ELABORATE ON WHO IN THE "MOSCOW GROUP" OF </p><p>DEPUTIES SHARED HIS VIEWS.  ALTHOUGH FOR THE PRESENT </p><p>THOSE VIEWS WERE CLEARLY IN THE MINORITY AS FAR AS </p><p>OFFICIAL SOVIET POLICY WAS CONCERNED, OSTALSKIY SAW A </p><p>TIME APPROACHING WHEN SOVIET LEGISLATORS WOULD DEBATE </p><p>THIS AND OTHER FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES IN THE SUPREME </p><p>SOVIET. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>/------- </p><p> </p><p>21. DESPITE ANY PERSONAL EMBARRASSMENT WHICH SOVIET </p><p>ASSOCIATION WITH REVOLUTIONARY IRAN MAY BE CAUSING </p><p>SOVIET OFFICIALS AND JOURNALISTS, THE OFFICIAL SOVIET </p><p>APPROACH CONTINUES TO BE AIMED AT CULTIVATING </p><p>NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH IRAN IN THE HOPE THAT </p><p>WHOEVER EMERGES AT THE TOP FOLLOWING THE PROTRACTED </p><p>LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE IN IRAN WILL BE A "PRAGMATIST". </p><p>AS SOVIET OFFICIALS CONCEDED, HOWEVER, THIS TERM IN </p><p>THE IRANIAN CONTEXT IS ONLY RELATIVE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MATLOCK </p><p></p></div>
