<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 004488 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FAA ROME FOR JOYNER </p><p>FAA BRUSSELS FOR AEU-1 </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EB AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: FOLLOW-UP ON FAA RECOMMENDATIONS ON AVIATION </p><p>SAFETY OVERSIGHT </p><p> </p><p>REF: 300852Z_ FAA ROME </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) EconCouns met with Transportation Deputy U/S Kemal </p><p>Albayrak July 16 to reiterate FAA concerns resulting from its </p><p>May 21 consultations in Ankara, and to urge the GOT to revise </p><p>its legislation to give the Directorate General for Civil </p><p>Aviation the authority needed to operate in compliance with </p><p>ICAO standards and recommended practices.  While welcoming </p><p>the improvements the FAA team found, EconCouns highlighted </p><p>concerns (reftel) regarding the turnover of DGCA personnel </p><p>and Turkish Airlines replacement of key operations and safety </p><p>personnel without consultation with DGCA.  He specifically </p><p>noted that DGCA\'s inability under current legislation to hire </p><p>and fire personnel without the Ministry\'s approval appeared </p><p>to be the main cause of DGCA\'s personnel problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Albayrak emphasized the GOT\'s seriousness on air </p><p>safety issues and its willingness to work with the FAA, </p><p>including welcoming an FAA assessment of DGCA\'s safety </p><p>oversight capability later this year.  While politely </p><p>questioning the assertion that most of the DGCA staff have </p><p>limited experience, Albayrak acknowledged most of the </p><p>concerns raised by FAA.  He said the Ministry expects to </p><p>address most if not all of these issues via new legislation, </p><p>which he has drafted and which is now circulating within the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
