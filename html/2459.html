<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000585 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE, EUR/WE, AND SA HOLMES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 02/06/2007 </p><p>TAGS: MW, PREL, SR, ZL, UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOI WORRIED ABOUT MONTENEGRIN REFERENDUM; LOOKING </p><p>FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SA HOLMES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) BELGRADE 148 B) STATE 19796 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINCOUNS TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 8. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE GOI AND EU ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY </p><p>CONCERNED OVER THE POTENTIAL REGIONAL INSTABILITY THAT COULD </p><p>BE FOMENTED BY AN INDEPENDENT MONTENEGRO.  THE EU BELIEVES </p><p>THAT IT IS NOT TOO LATE FOR THE IC TO STALL THE MOMENTUM </p><p>TOWARD A REFERENDUM.  ACCORDING TO THE ITALIANS, THERE IS A </p><p>PERCEPTION AMONG LEADERS IN BELGRADE AND PODGORICA THAT THE </p><p>USG HAS RESIGNED ITSELF TO THE INEVITABILITY OF AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT EU.  WE HAVE REITERATED TO OUR INTERLOCUTORS IN </p><p>THE MFA AND ON PRESIDENT CIAMPI\'S STAFF THAT THE USG REMAINED </p><p>FIRMLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE EU TO KEEP MONTENEGRO IN </p><p>THE FRY.  OUR GOI CONTACTS LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SA </p><p>HOLMES ON BALKAN ISSUES, AND HOPE THAT HE CAN SCHEDULE A STOP </p><p>IN ROME ON HIS WAY TO OR FROM THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ON JANUARY 24, THE HEAD OF THE MFA\'S BALKAN OFFICE, </p><p>MAURIZIO MASSARI, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE GOI WAS BECOMING </p><p>INCREASINGLY CONCERNED OVER THE PROSPECT OF A REFERENDUM ON </p><p>THE STATUS OF MONTENEGRO, AND THE PRECEDENT FOR THE REGION </p><p>SHOULD IT RESULT IN AN INDEPENDENT MONTENEGRO.  ANOTHER WEAK </p><p>STATE, UNABLE TO STAND ON ITS OWN FEET ECONOMICALLY, </p><p>POLITICALLY OR MILITARILY WOULD CAUSE FURTHER INSTABILITY IN </p><p>THE REGION AND CREATE ANOTHER MONEY PIT FOR INCREASINGLY </p><p>SCARCE IC AID FUNDS. AN ADDITIONAL OBVIOUS WORRY WAS THE </p><p>POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS ON KOSOVO.  MASSARI SAID THAT ITALY\'S </p><p>AND THE EU\'S IDEAS WERE "FIRMING UP" REGARDING THE NEED FOR </p><p>THE IC TO TAKE A TOUGHER LINE AGAINST INDEPENDENCE BOTH IN </p><p>PODGORICA AND BELGRADE.  THE EU\'S VIEW IS IT WAS NOT TOO LATE </p><p>FOR THE IC TO ELABORATE A LIST OF DISINCENTIVES TO HELP STALL </p><p>THE MOMENTUM TOWARDS A REFERENDUM, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE IC </p><p>UNDERSCORING THAT ALL INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE </p><p>CHANNELED THROUGH BELGRADE.  MASSARI HOPED THAT THE U.S. </p><p>WOULD JOIN THE EU IN SUPPORT OF SYG SOLANA\'S EFFORTS TO KEEP </p><p>MONTENEGRO WITHIN THE FRY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  MASSARI SAID THAT THERE WAS A PERCEPTION AMONG SOME </p><p>LEADERS, IN BOTH BELGRADE AND PODGORICA, THAT THE USG HAD </p><p>RESIGNED ITSELF TO THE INEVITABILITY OF AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>MONTENEGRO.  THIS PERCEPTION WAS UNDERMINING THE EU\'S EFFORTS </p><p>TO STOP THE REFERENDUM.  POLOFF REITERATED TO MASSARI THAT </p><p>THE USG POSITION HAD NOT CHANGED.  OUR VIEW WAS THAT A STABLE </p><p>FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA, WHICH INCLUDED MONTENEGRO, </p><p>WAS THE BEST OPTION FOR A SECURE FUTURE FOR MONTENEGRINS AND </p><p>SERBS ALIKE.  POLOFF EMPHASIZED THAT FRY/MONTENEGRIN LEADERS </p><p>SHOULD NOT MISTAKE THE USG\'S SLIGHTLY LOWER PROFILE AT THE </p><p>MOMENT, IN RELATION TO THE EU\'S, FOR SUPPORT FOR INDEPENDENCE </p><p>OR A RIFT BETWEEN THE EU AND U.S. ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT CIAMPI, </p><p>STEFANO STEFANINI, EXPRESSED SIMILAR WORRIES TO POL MC TOM </p><p>COUNTRYMAN AND POLOFF ON JANUARY 25.  STEFANINI SAID THAT THE </p><p>GOI WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE "SECURITY RISK" POSED BY A </p><p>SMALL STATE OF ONE-HALF MILLION PEOPLE, FINANCED ALMOST </p><p>EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH SMUGGLING AND TRAFFICKING.  THIS "ILLEGAL </p><p>SWITZERLAND" IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BALKANS WOULD BE MUCH </p><p>HARDER TO CONTROL AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE THAN AS AN ENTITY </p><p>WITHIN THE FRY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  STEFANINI REPORTED THAT IT BECAME CLEAR TO HIM </p><p>DURING PRESIDENT CIAMPI\'S JANUARY 17 VISIT TO THE FRY THAT </p><p>PRO-INDEPENDENCE MONTENEGRIN POLITICIANS WERE ENCOURAGED BY </p><p>WHAT THEY PERCEIVED AS A SPLIT BETWEEN THE EU AND U.S. ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF INDEPENDENCE.  MASSARI ALSO COMPLAINED THAT EVEN </p><p>THOUGH CIAMPI HAD MADE CLEAR IN HIS STATEMENTS AND MEETING </p><p>THE GOI\'S SUPPORT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE FEDERATION, </p><p>THE MONTENEGRIN PRESS REPORTED ITS OWN "INCORRECT" SPIN ON </p><p>CIAMPI\'S TRIP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COUNTRYMAN REASSURED STEFANINI THAT THE USG REMAINED </p><p>FIRMLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE EU TO KEEP MONTENEGRO IN </p><p>THE FRY.  HE USED AMBASSADOR MONTGOMERY\'S REMARKS TO </p><p>MONTENEGRIN LEADERS, REPORTED REF A, IN WHICH MONTGOMERY </p><p>CALLED ON ALL SIDES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EU SPONSORED </p><p>DIALOGUE AND WARNED AGAINST HOLDING THE REFERENDUM WITHOUT </p><p>THE CONCURRENCE OF ALL PARTIES AND THE IC, AS EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>WE WERE IN LINE WITH EU VIEWS.  COUNTRYMAN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>THE U.S. MAY HAVE SOME SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME </p><p>OF THE PROCESS, GIVEN THE FACT THAT BOTH PARTIES HAD FAILED, </p><p>THUS FAR, TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.  WE ARE ALSO BEING REALISTIC </p><p>BY STARTING TO THINK ABOUT CONTINGENCIES SHOULD NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>REMAIN STALLED AND A REFERENDUM BECOMES MORE IMMINENT.  BUT, </p><p>EMPHASIZED COUNTRYMAN, THAT SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE REFERENDUM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  BOTH MASSARI AND STEFANINI WERE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT </p><p>AMBASSADOR HOLMES HAD BEEN APPOINTED AS SA FOR SOUTHEAST </p><p>EUROPE (REF B).  MASSARI IN PARTICULAR WAS ANXIOUS TO HAVE </p><p>HOLMES VISIT ITALY TO DISCUSS STRATEGY ON A RANGE OF BALKAN </p><p>ISSUES AND, DEPENDING ON TIMING, WOULD WORK WITH US TO SECURE </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL APPOINTMENTS IN THE MFA, UP TO AND INCLUDING </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL BALDOCCI.  EMBASSY STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ONE OF AMBASSADOR HOLMES\' FIRST EUROPEAN STOPS IS ROME. </p><p>ITALY, AS HEAD OF THE G-8 BALKAN WORKING GROUP IN 2001, DID </p><p>AN EXCELLENT JOB IN STEERING G-8 POLICY AND STATEMENTS ON A </p><p>NUMBER OF CRITICAL ISSUES, INCLUDING THE KOSOVO ELECTIONS AND </p><p>FYROM FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT.  AS EU PRESIDENT IN THE LATTER </p><p>HALF OF \'03, THE GOI WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DRIVING FUTURE </p><p>EUROPEAN ENGAGEMENT IN THE BALKANS.  DEPT IS REQUESTED TO </p><p>KEEP POST UPDATED ON SA HOLMES\' TRAVEL PLANS TO THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
