SUMMARY: IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL A, POST </p><p>PROVIDES BACKGROUND ON ITALY\'S BARRIERS TO </p><p>AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY. ITALY\'S THREE </p><p>NATIONAL BARRIERS TO AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY ARE A BAN ON EU-APPROVED CORN </p><p>VARIETIES, ITALY\'S RESTRICTIVE THRESHOLD FOR </p><p>ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE OF BIOTECH MATERIAL IN </p><p>CONVENTIONAL SEEDS, AND A NATIONAL SEED </p><p>REGISTRY. </p><p> </p><p>THE CORN BAN </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE AMATO DECREE, PUBLISHED AUGUST 8, </p><p>2000, WAS CALLED A "SUSPENSION" BY THE </p><p>ITALIANS BECAUSE IT SUPPOSEDLY WAS A </p><p>TEMPORARY MEASURE TO PROHIBIT IMPORTS OF FOUR </p><p>EU-APPROVED BIOTECH CORN VARIETIES. THE BAN </p><p>HAS NEVER BEEN RESCINDED. REFS B AND C DETAIL </p><p>THE CORN VARIETIES, PROCEDURAL DETAILS ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04519  01 OF 02  171516Z </p><p>NOTIFICATION, AND EU COMMISSION REACTION. </p><p>ITALY INVOKED ARTICLE 12 OF THE EU\'S 1997 </p><p>NOVEL FOODS REGULATION NUMBER 258/97 ON THE </p><p>GROUNDS THAT AS A MEMBER STATE THEY WERE </p><p>ALLOWED TO SUSPEND TRADE IN NOVEL FOOD ITEMS </p><p>WHICH COULD BE PROVED TO BE HARMFUL TO HUMAN </p><p>HEALTH OR THE ENVIRONMENT. ITALY PUT FORTH A </p><p>JUSTIFICATION OF THE BAN BASED ON A HEALTH </p><p>RISK. THE COMMISSION ISSUED AN OPINION, </p><p>CS/NF/DOSLL ADD 4 REV 2 FINAL AND CONCLUDED </p><p>"THE COMMITTEE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE </p><p>INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE ITALIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES DOES NOT PROVIDE DETAILED </p><p>SCIENTIFIC GROUNDS FOR CONSIDERING THAT THE </p><p>USE OF THE NOVEL FOODS IN QUESTION ENDANGERS </p><p>HUMAN HEALTH." NOTWITHSTANDING THIS </p><p>CONCLUSION, THE COMMISSION FAILED TO CENSURE </p><p>THE GOI. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE BAN PROHIBITS IMPORTS ON THE FOUR </p><p>TYPES OF EU-APPROVED BIOTECH CORN, WHETHER AS </p><p>INGREDIENTS OR AS FINISHED PRODUCTS. THE </p><p>ITALIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS AUTHORITY OVER </p><p>TESTING CORN INGREDIENTS IN PROCESSED FOOD, </p><p>AND THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE HAS AUTHORITY </p><p>OVER SEED CORN FOR PLANTING OR FEED CORN. </p><p>COMMENT: THESE MINISTRIES CONTINUE TO BE IN </p><p>CONFLICT OVER GM TESTING ISSUES; THEY DO NOT </p><p>COORDINATE ON IMPLEMENTATION OR </p><p>METHODOLOGIES. END COMMENT. IN REF D POST </p><p>REPORTED SCANT ENFORCEMENT OF THE BAN. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04519  01 OF 02  171516Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  TRADE IMPACT  THE AMATO DECREE IS LARGELY </p><p>A POLITICAL GESTURE. ITALY IS A RELATIVELY </p><p>LARGE PRODUCER OF CORN, APPROXIMATELY 10 </p><p>MILLION TONS ANNUALLY, WHICH IT CONSUMES </p><p>DOMESTICALLY. ITALY IMPORTS ONLY ABOUT </p><p>500,000 TONS ANNUALLY, ALL FROM FRANCE. </p><p> </p><p>CONVENTIONAL SEED TRADE </p><p> </p><p>5.  AFTER SEVERAL PLANTING SEASONS FRAUGHT </p><p>WITH CONFLICTS OVER "ZERO TOLERANCE" OF GM IN </p><p>SEEDS FOR PLANTING, ITALY\'S NEW MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE PROPOSED A DECREE DECEMBER 28, </p><p>2001 TO ADOPT A TOLERANCE FOR ADVENTITIOUS </p><p>PRESENCE OF GM IN CONVENTIONAL CORN AND </p><p>SOYBEAN SEEDS FOR PLANTING. HAVING </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY FAILED TO REACH CONSENSUS AMONG </p><p>THE THREE MAJOR FARM GROUPS AND OTHER </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS, MINISTER ALEMANNO OUTLINED A </p><p>PLAN CALLING FOR AN OUTRIGHT REJECTION OF </p><p>SEED LOTS TESTING AT MORE THAN ONE PERCENT GM </p><p>CONTENT AND FOR AN APPLICATION OF "FLEXIBLE </p><p>CONTROLS" OF LOTS ABOVE ZERO BUT LESS THAN </p><p>ONE PERCENT.  SUBSEQUENT IMPORTS OF SEEDS </p><p>LOTS WERE TESTED WITH SOME REJECTIONS OF U.S. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3921 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04519  02 OF 02  171516Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00 </p><p>      E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  NSF-01   OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------E89422  171517Z /38 </p><p>P 171452Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5876 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2275 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004519 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB FOR RCEKUTA AND CSCHONANDER </p><p>EUR/ERA PASS TO JOHN HENNESSEY NILAND </p><p>EB/TPP PASS TO DEBBIE MALAC </p><p>FAS/USDA PASS TO EJONES AND DYOUNG </p><p>USTR PASS TO MSLOAN </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEU </p><p>EUR/WE FOR TEKACH-BALL AND BURKHEAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04519  02 OF 02  171516Z </p><p>MILAN FOR PRINCIPAL OFFICER </p><p>FLORENCE FOR PRINCIPAL OFFICER </p><p>NAPLES FOR PRINCIPAL OFFICER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, EUN, TBIO, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S BARRIERS TO AG BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p> </p><p>SEEDS FOR PLANTING.  THE MINAG HAS PUBLICLY </p><p>STATED THAT THERE IS NO CHANGE IN ITALY\'S </p><p>ZERO TOLERANCE FOR BIOTECH IN SEEDS. IN </p><p>PRACTICE, ITALY HAS MOVED FROM A "ZERO </p><p>TOLERANCE" RELYING ON A QUALITATIVE </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF GM CONTENT IN SEEDS TO A "ZERO </p><p>TOLERANCE" WITH QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT, BUT </p><p>ITALY STILL LACKS CONSISTENCY IN TESTING </p><p>METHODOLOGY AND THUS AN UNEQUIVOCAL THRESHOLD </p><p>OF TOLERANCE FOR SPECIFIC BIOTECH EVENTS. </p><p>THERE IS STILL CONSIDERABLE RISK TO US </p><p>EXPORTERS OF SEEDS THAT THEIR PRODUCTS CAN BE </p><p>REJECTED AT PORTS. THERE IS ALSO RISK AT THE </p><p>POINT OF SALE, BECAUSE SEEDS CAN ENTER ITALY </p><p>BY OVERLAND ROUTES THROUGH OTHER EU </p><p>COUNTRIES, AND LATER BE REMOVED FROM RETAIL </p><p>SHELVES AND SUBJECTED TO SAMPLING. REF E </p><p>DETAILS AGMIN ALEMANNO\'S JANUARY 2002 </p><p>STATEMENTS ON THRESHOLDS FOR SEEDS FOR </p><p>PLANTING. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC IMPACTS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04519  02 OF 02  171516Z </p><p>6.  ALTHOUGH DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY, IN PART </p><p>BECAUSE OF TRADE WHICH ENTERS ITALY FROM LAND </p><p>ROUTES ORIGINATING IN OTHER EU COUNTRIES, </p><p>POST BELIEVES THAT THE US SUPPLIES </p><p>APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PERCENT OF ITALY\'S </p><p>IMPORTS OF SOYBEAN SEED AND ABOUT HALF OF </p><p>ITALY\'S CORN SEED. US EXPORTS OF ALL SEED </p><p>TYPES IN 2001 TOTALED $32 MILLION. IN THREE </p><p>OF THE LAST SIX YEARS ITALY HAS BOUGHT US SOY </p><p>AND CORN SEEDS TOGETHER WORTH MORE THAN $45 </p><p>MILLION. HOWEVER, US SEED SALES TO ITALY ARE </p><p>HIGHLY VARIABLE FROM YEAR TO YEAR. DATA DO </p><p>NOT POINT TO ONE REASON FOR THIS VARIABILITY, </p><p>BUT THE UNCERTAINTIES AND PROHIBITIONS </p><p>AGAINST BIOTECH IN CONVENTIONAL SEED HAVE </p><p>INTRODUCED SIGNIFICANT RISK INTO THE MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>NATIONAL SEED REGISTRY </p><p> </p><p>7.  ITALY MAINTAINS A NATIONAL SEED REGISTRY </p><p>THAT CAN PROHIBIT SEEDS FROM BEING IMPORTED </p><p>IF THEY ARE DEEMED TO PUT THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>ECOSYSTEM OR BIODIVERSITY AT RISK, REGARDLESS </p><p>OF WHETHER THESE SEEDS HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY </p><p>OTHER EU MEMBERS (SEE REF F). APPLICATIONS </p><p>MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE, WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY BLOCKED </p><p>APPROVAL OF BIOTECH SEEDS FOR PLANTING IN </p><p>ITALY. THERE IS ALSO A TWO YEAR FIELD TESTING </p><p>REQUIREMENT FOR ALL TYPES OF SEEDS FOR </p><p>PLANTING.
