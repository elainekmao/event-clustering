THE WORKSHOP RATIONALE, AS </p><p>EXPLAINED BY THE ORGANIZERS, STEMMED FROM THE INCREASE IN </p><p>PROPRIETARY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS THAT IS OCCURRING UNDER </p><p>THE NEW FRAMEWORK OF THE TRIPS AGREEMENT (THE WTO AGREEMENT </p><p>ON TRADE-RELATED ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS). </p><p>NOTING THAT THE TRIPS AGREEMENT GENERALLY AIMS TO REDUCE </p><p>DISTORTIONS IN TRADE AND TO PROMOTE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION </p><p>AND TRANSFER, THE CONFERENCE ORGANIZERS STRESSED THAT IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT THAT THE ITS IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOT RESTRICT </p><p>EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE FOOD INSECURITY.  ACCORDING TO THE FAO, </p><p>GIVEN THAT CAPACITY AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>AMONG COUNTRIES AND THAT THE ADVANCED PRODUCTS BEING </p><p>PRODUCED BY MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TARGETED TO THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ACTION </p><p>IS NEEDED TO FACILITATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN PRIVATE FIRMS </p><p>AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.

IPR CONSTRAINTS, NEEDS, AND OPPORTUNITIES OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECTOR RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WERE IDENTIFIED EARLY IN THE </p><p>WORKSHOP.  A PRINCIPAL THEME OF DISCUSSION WAS TODAY\'S HIGH </p><p>RISK/LOW BENEFIT SITUATION THAT DISCOURAGES PUBLIC RESEARCH </p><p>INSTITUTIONS FROM INVESTING IN BIOTECH OR PATENTING THEIR </p><p>INNOVATIONS.  BARRIERS TO THE DIFFUSION OF AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECH, IMPOSED BY BIOSAFETY CONCERNS IN BOTH INTERNAL AND </p><p>EXPORT MARKETS AND HIGH REGULATION COSTS, CAN ACT AS </p><p>BARRIERS TO PUBLIC BIOTECH RESEARCH.  INADEQUATE </p><p>COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND POLICY </p><p>MAKERS CONTRIBUTES TO A MISUNDERSTANDING AND FEAR OF NEW </p><p>TECHNOLOGIES, PROMPTING THE ADOPTION OF OVERLY CONSERVATIVE </p><p>POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  PARTICIPANTS NOTED THE LACK OF INCENTIVES OFFERED TO </p><p>PUBLIC SECTOR SCIENTISTS FOR PATENTING THEIR INNOVATIONS. </p><p>TODAY, PUBLISHED RESEARCH CONFERS MORE CAREER REWARDS THAN </p><p>PATENTING.

INSUFFICIENT NATIONAL RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH AND </p><p>INADEQUATE IPR CAPACITY WERE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED AS CENTRAL </p><p>PROBLEMS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  WHEN ADEQUATE CAPACITY </p><p>EXISTS AT THE NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, THE CAPACITY </p><p>TO MOVE TECHNOLOGY TO THE LOCAL LEVEL, WHERE IT CAN HELP </p><p>SMALL FARMERS, IS OFTEN LACKING.  SPEAKERS REPRESENTING </p><p>PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND PRIVATE FIRMS (MONSANTO) EXPRESSED </p><p>OPTIMISM ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS </p><p>TO ADDRESS WIDE-RANGING NEEDS, BUT STRESSED THAT DONOR-BASED </p><p>ASSISTANCE IS NOT THE FINAL SOLUTION SINCE IT IS </p><p>UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TERM. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT EVERYONE WANTS:  THE COUNTRIES\' PERSPECTIVES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>AFRICA:  LOW CAPACITY, DISTRUST, CONCERN OVER SUSTAINABLITY </p><p>OF BIOTECH INITIATIVES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>7.

IN THE CASE OF KENYA, ODAME </p><p>COMMENTED ON ITS LOW CAPACITY IN RISK ASSESSMENT AND </p><p>LAMENTED THE LACK OF EXTENSION, THE ABILITY TO MOVE </p><p>TECHNOLOGY TO THE LOCAL LEVEL.  HE NOTED THAT THE MONSANTO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03648  03 OF 06  240912Z </p><p>AND USAID PARTNERSHIP IN SWEET POTATO RESEARCH, DESPITE </p><p>BEING CRITICIZED AS AN ATTEMPT TO OPEN UP THE MARKET, </p><p>STIMULATED THE FORMATION OF NEW BIOTECH REGULATIONS.

SITHOLE NIANG EXPLAINED HOW ZIMBABWE IS PLAGUED BY A </p><p>BRAIN DRAIN AND NETWORKS BASED ON PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS </p><p>RATHER THAN EXPERTISE.  PUBLIC AWARENESS OF BIOSAFETY ISSUES </p><p>IS LACKING. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE RESEARCH INITIATIVES IN </p><p>CASSAVA, MAIZE, AND OTHER CROPS OF INTEREST TO THE COUNTRY, </p><p>THERE ARE "HUGE" LOBBIES AGAINST TRANSGENIC TECHNOLOGIES BY </p><p>THE FORESTRY AND TOBACCO INDUSTRIES AND BY ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>GROUPS. SHE ATTRIBUTED HER COUNTRY\'S RECENT REJECTION OF GM </p><p>FOOD AID TO A LACK OF MILLING CAPACITY.  SHE SAID THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT REQUIRED GM GRAINS TO BE MILLED BEFORE </p><p>DISTRIBUTION IN ORDER TO PREVENT FOOD AID RECIPIENTS FROM </p><p>PLANTING THE SEEDS THEY RECEIVE.  THE GOVERNMENT REJECTED </p><p>THE AID BECAUSE, IN THEORY, MILLING CAPACITY WAS </p><p>INSUFFICIENT TO FULFILL THIS REQUIREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>INDIA:  BIODIVERSITY FOCUS, NEW INCENTIVES, REALISTIC GOALS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>9.  S. R.

SHE ARGUED THAT THE BENEFITS ACCRUED FROM </p><p>PATENTING A NEW, GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANT VARIETY SHOULD </p><p>BE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE RESEARCHERS WHO PRODUCED IT AND THE </p><p>FARMERS WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03648  03 OF 06  240912Z </p><p>TRADITIONAL BREEDING TO PRODUCE THE "BIOTECH" PROGENITOR. </p><p>SHE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE POSSIBILITY THAT A </p><p>COUNTRY\'S MICROORGANISM MIGHT BE PATENTED BY AN OUTSIDER, </p><p>REQUIRING THE COUNTRY TO PAY ROYALTIES FOR THE USE OF ITS </p><p>INDIGENOUS GENETIC MATERIAL.  ON A PRACTICAL NOTE, SHE </p><p>COMMENTED THAT SCIENTISTS NEED TRAINING IN NEGOTIATION AND </p><p>KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT IS PATENTABLE.  TODAY\'S UNIVERSITY </p><p>RESEARCH SYSTEM REWARDS SCIENTISTS FOR PUBLISHING WORK </p><p>(LEAVING IT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN) RATHER THAN PATENTING IT. </p><p>TO INDUCE RESEARCHERS TO PATENT, IT IS NECESSARY TO INCREASE </p><p>THE PRESTIGE OF PATENTS AND INCREASE THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS </p><p>THAT THEY OFFER TO SCIENTISTS.  TO MAKE BIOTECH MORE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SHE RECOMMENDED </p><p>DIFFERENTIAL PRICING SCHEMES AND STRESSED THE NEED FOR </p><p>EFFECTIVE HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT.  TO IMPROVE THE </p><p>PUBLIC IMAGE OF BIOTECH, RESEARCHERS SHOULD AVOID OVER- </p><p>HYPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES BEFORE THEY CAN BE RELEASED, </p><p>INADVERTENTLY SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE TYPE OF </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT GENERATED BY THE YET UNMATERIALIZED PROMISES </p><p>OF GOLDEN RICE.  AS REGARDS RESEARCH AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE </p><p>PARTNERSHIPS, RAO COMMENTED THAT EFFORTS IN INDIA WERE BEING </p><p>TARGETED TO ITS SPECIFIC NEEDS, SUCH AS DROUGHT AND SALINITY </p><p>RESISTANCE AND NUTRITION.

CHINA NOTED THAT IT IS DEVELOPING ONE OF THE </p><p>LARGEST PUBLIC BIOTECH PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD AND IS SEEKING </p><p>TO IMPROVE RESEARCH CAPACITY AND IMPROVE BIOTECH MANAGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>LATIN AMERICA:  CUBA\'S AMBITION, ILLEGAL PLANTING ELSEWHERE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>11.  AMONG THE LATIN AMERICA PARTICIPANTS, CUBA\'S PUBLIC </p><p>BIOTECH RESEARCH PROGRAM STOOD OUT AS THE MOST AMBITIOUS </p><p>(OR, AT THE LEAST, CARLOS BORROTO, CUBA\'S REPRESENTATIVE, </p><p>WAS THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HIS COUNTRY\'S PUBLIC </p><p>RESEARCH SECTOR).  BORROTO EXPLAINED THAT BIOTECH RECEIVED </p><p>HUGE GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT ($1 BILLION) AND TREATS THE </p><p>DOMESTIC MARKET AS ITS FIRST PRIORITY, CONCENTRATING ON FOOD </p><p>SECURITY AND SOME EXPORTS.  HE NOTED THAT, ALTHOUGH PATENTS </p><p>WERE NOT SEEN AS A PRIORITY UP TO THE BEGINNING OF THE </p><p>1990S, RESEARCHERS ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE WORLD PATENT </p><p>SITUATION AND TRYING TO DESIGN PROJECTS THAT WILL FILL IN </p><p>GAPS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  ALEJANDRO BLANCO-LABRA OF THE CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y </p><p>DE ESTUDIOS AVANZADOS-IPN (CINVESTAV), THE MEXICAN </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE, SKIRTED QUESTIONS ABOUT LEGISLATION THAT HAS </p><p>OFFICIALLY BARRED BIOTECH RESEARCH IN MEXICO WITH THE </p><p>COMMENT THAT HE HOPED THINGS WOULD SOON CHANGE. HE NOTED </p><p>THAT FOREIGN COMPANIES MOST OFTEN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03648  04 OF 06  240913Z </p><p>PATENT SYSTEM IN MEXICO.  ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF THE BIOTECH </p><p>PATENTS ARE HELD BY MEXICANS, WHILE FIFTY PERCENT ARE HELD </p><p>BY U.S. COMPANIES OR INDIVIDUALS.  HE ECHOED THE INDIAN </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE\'S COMMENT THAT RESEARCH INCENTIVES WERE </p><p>ACADEMICALLY ORIENTED AND DID NOT REWARD TECHNOLOGY </p><p>TRANSFER.  HE LISTED LACK OF VENTURE CAPITAL AS A CONSTRAINT </p><p>TO BIOTECH RESEARCH.  COMMENT:  THIS STATEMENT REFLECTS A </p><p>FREQUENTLY HEARD AND NAVE VIEW OF VENTURE CAPITALISTS, WHO </p><p>ARE BLAMED FOR LACK OF INTERESTS IN MARKETS WHERE SCIENTIFIC </p><p>INNOVATION IS RARELY TRANSFORMED TO PATENTABLE INVENTIONS. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  MARIA SAMPAIO, AN EXPERT FROM THE BRAZILIAN AGRICULTURE </p><p>RESEARCH CORPORATION (EMBRAPA), COMMENTED THAT ITS PARTNERS </p><p>IN GM RESEARCH HAVE BEEN MOSTLY THE SAME AS THOSE IN </p><p>TRADITIONAL BREEDING METHODS AND NOTED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT </p><p>THAT FUNDS GENERATED FROM BIOTECH GO BACK INTO THE RESEARCH </p><p>PROCESS.  SHE CALLED FOR A EUROPEAN-DRIVEN REVIEW OF THE </p><p>PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE AND NOTED THAT THE EU\'S ATTEMPT TO </p><p>SHIFT ITS VIEWS INTO INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE </p><p>HIGHLY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL, WHERE </p><p>FARMERS HAVE ILLEGALLY PLANTED GM CROPS WHOSE APPROVAL HAS </p><p>BEEN HELD UP FOR POLITICAL REASONS.
