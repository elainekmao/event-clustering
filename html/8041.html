<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003155 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: RETURN OF THE HOCA </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter.  Reason: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: At Saadet Party\'s May 11 national convention, </p><p>long-time leader of Turkey\'s Islamist movement Necmettin </p><p>Erbakan returned to active politics as party chairman. </p><p>Unlike recent conventions of right-of-center DYP and ANAP, </p><p>Saadet\'s congress was far more lively and colorful.  The mood </p><p>of the crowd and tone of official speeches were decidedly </p><p>anti-AK Party, more specifically anti-P.M. Erdogan. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloff attended Islamist Saadet Party\'s May 11 </p><p>national congress, where long-time leader of Turkey\'s </p><p>Islamist movement Necmettin Erbakan (known as \'Hoca\' or </p><p>teacher) officially returned to active political life after </p><p>his five-year political ban was lifted in February.  The </p><p>77-year old Erbakan was the only candidate for Saadet leader </p><p>and received unanimous support from the party\'s 1153 </p><p>delegates.  Former Saadet leader Recai Kutan retained a high </p><p>position in the party as a member of the party\'s General </p><p>Administrative Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>\'Our army, Our Commander\' </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In contrast to right-of-center DYP and ANAP </p><p>conventions attended by poloff, the Saadet congress was </p><p>orderly and spirited.  Devotees packed the undersized arena </p><p>more than an hour before the convention began, while several </p><p>thousand others mingled outside chanting Islam-tinged slogans </p><p>like \'mucahit Erbakan\' (Islamic warrior Erbakan).  Unlike the </p><p>DYP and ANAP congresses, there were significant numbers </p><p>families with young children in attendance.  A large section </p><p>of the arena was reserved for headscarved women activists, </p><p>who were clearly the loudest group on hand.  The slogans and </p><p>chants continued after Erbakan arrived and was escorted to a </p><p>red plush couch on stage: "here\'s our army, here\'s our </p><p>commander"; "the legend has returned"; "welcome, my sultan"; </p><p>and "Mehmet the Conqueror was your age when he conquered </p><p>Istanbul." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Light Bulb Burned Out? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The mood of the crowd was decidedly anti-AK Party, </p><p>more specifically anti-P.M. Erdogan.  Almost all of the </p><p>numerous banners raised by the crowd attacked AK in some way: </p><p>"My hoca has returned; the light bulb is burned out" (a </p><p>phrase that rhymes in Turkish; AK\'s symbol is a light bulb); </p><p>"My hoca, rescue us from these children"; and "Those who </p><p>skipped class should have stayed in school."  In addition, a </p><p>Saadet official read aloud goodwill messages from political </p><p>figures.  The crowd booed Erdogan\'s welcome statement but </p><p>cheered loudly messages from Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc </p><p>(an Erdogan rival in AK); opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal; </p><p>and far-left nationalist Worker\'s Party leader Dogu Perincek. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Speeches by Erbakan and other senior party officials </p><p>picked up on the theme, heavily criticizing AK for </p><p>ineffective governance and for straying from the Islamist </p><p>flock.  Erbakan, in particular, accused AK members of </p><p>deserting the path they had chosen for 30 years.  He </p><p>pointedly left out any mention of Fazilet Party in his </p><p>remarks on the history of the Islamist movement in Turkey </p><p>(note: Erdogan, Arinc, and others broke away from Fazilet </p><p>after the party was closed in 2001 and formed AK. End note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: There is a core of about 40 AK M.P.s who, as </p><p>former provincial lieutenants in Erbakan\'s Milli Gorus </p><p>(National View) movement, remain devoted to him and intent on </p><p>disrupting Erdogan\'s control of the parliamentary group and </p><p>legislative agenda.  Concerned that Erbakan will woo many or </p><p>all of them away from AK, Erdogan has indicated to his </p><p>advisors he has limited room for bold political maneuver, </p><p>including foreign policy steps seen by Milli Gorus adherents </p><p>as too openly in line with U.S. interests, in the months </p><p>leading up to AK\'s first party congress.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
