<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001767 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM THE CHARGE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   N/A </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 132 (09-23-02) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  DEMINING/ESF IDEAS </p><p> </p><p>DEMINING/ESF IDEAS </p><p>------------------ </p><p>1.  (SBU) We have the following demining and ESF ideas </p><p>for your review: </p><p> </p><p>Demining: </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) PM/HDP knows the demining situation in Sri Lanka </p><p>from A through Z.  As you know, Murph McCloy and company </p><p>ran an assessment of the situation over the summer, which </p><p>came up with a number of conclusions.  The end result was </p><p>a decision that the QRDF would be extended until late </p><p>October and that a DoD-run military-to-military training </p><p>program would start up shortly thereafter.   We </p><p>understand that State Department funding would be </p><p>involved in the mil-to-mil program.  While we take a bow </p><p>to PM/HDP based on its clear expertise in this issue, we </p><p>have the following ideas on other possible demining add- </p><p>ons after discussions with experts in Colombo: </p><p> </p><p>-- Sri Lanka In-Country Projects:  These projects would </p><p>be similar to the QRDF project in all but name. </p><p>Essentially, the USG would fund contractors to demine and </p><p>remove UXO at sites in the north and east.  In the north, </p><p>the team would continue the work that the QRDF is now </p><p>doing in Jaffna.  In the east, the team could set up at a </p><p>site near Batticaloa or Trincomalee where mines and UXO </p><p>were present.  (Note:  We think the east is an important </p><p>area for the U.S. to show the flag in, given the inter- </p><p>ethnic friction present there that could potentially </p><p>disrupt the peace process.)  We would estimate that the </p><p>Jaffna project would cost 2 million USD a year and the </p><p>smaller eastern project about 1 million USD a year. </p><p> </p><p>-- Civilian-to-civilian training:  As noted, the USG </p><p>already has a plan to begin mil-to-mil demining training. </p><p>This proposal would provide civilians with demining </p><p>training.  The training could be routed through local </p><p>foundations in Sri Lanka, including those with </p><p>involvement in the Tamil and Muslim communities.  The </p><p>training could also involve dogs or manual demining, </p><p>geared as necessary to the level of the trainees.  We </p><p>estimate that this project would cost 1.5 million USD per </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>ESF Proposals: </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The most pressing, immediate needs for </p><p>assistance in the conflict-affected northern and eastern </p><p>regions of Sri Lanka are related to the spontaneous </p><p>return of internally displaced persons and refugees </p><p>(160,000+ since the beginning of the year, according to </p><p>UN figures). Employment-generating, basic-needs resources </p><p>are required as quickly as possible not only for </p><p>returnees but also for other conflict-affected persons, </p><p>including members of the host communities into which </p><p>returnees are attempting to reintegrate. Unsustainable </p><p>return would destabilize the fragile peace process now </p><p>well underway; for that reason, the primary focus of </p><p>donor assistance on the North and East in the short term </p><p>is likely to be acceptable even to the majority of Sri </p><p>Lankans elsewhere on the island. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In the medium to longer-term, if not sooner, </p><p>however, assistance efforts ideally will offer clear </p><p>benefits for the South. This is particularly vital for </p><p>communities in the drought-prone southeastern districts, </p><p>where diversion of major portions of the GoSL\'s budget to </p><p>the conflict has deepened the region\'s traditional </p><p>poverty, and as de-mobilization of combatants </p><p>accelerates. In purely economic terms, the war has buoyed </p><p>the rural southern economy for years; assisting ex- </p><p>combatants in making the transition to peace will be a </p><p>key element to a sustainable process. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Possible targets for short-term assistance that </p><p>we envision the USAID\'s Office of Transitions Initiatives </p><p>taking the lead on include the following items with the </p><p>exception of micro-enterprise financing and the "e-peace </p><p>bridge". </p><p> </p><p>A.Drinking water and sanitation: Rain-water catchment </p><p>pans and construction/restoration of sanitary latrines. </p><p>These activities generate local employment and prevent </p><p>the spread of water-borne diseases.  Notional costs: </p><p>Catchment for 100,000 families, US$2.5 Million, latrines </p><p>for 50,000 familes: $US $1million  (in north, east & </p><p>south) </p><p> </p><p>B.Mine-risk education: Economic pressures continue to </p><p>force people into areas that are not safe due to presence </p><p>of mines and unexploded ordinance. US Government support </p><p>to RONCO, through 10/30, covers de-mining activities only </p><p>and not mine-risk education, an essential component of an </p><p>overall mine-action program.  Notional cost: US$200,000 </p><p>(in north and east) </p><p>C.Employment-generating restoration of small-scale </p><p>irrigation facilities, i.e. reservoirs.  Construction of </p><p>50 of these would generate jobs and have lasting "down- </p><p>stream" benefits for restoring small-scale agricultural </p><p>production.  Notional cost including cash for work and </p><p>locally-available equipment: US$1 Million.(north, east </p><p>and south) </p><p> </p><p>D."E Peace Bridge": Establishment of information- </p><p>technology education centers: </p><p>This initiative will provide through world link and </p><p>worldview International for the provision of ICT </p><p>equipment, training, online collaborative projects and </p><p>discussion on social cohesion in 100 secondary schools </p><p>and community centers. This program will result in </p><p>increased dialogue, linkages, and understanding between </p><p>Sri Lankan youth from different parts of the country, </p><p>provide training and employment opportunities in the IT </p><p>sector and provide access to technology. This will cost </p><p>US$ 1 Million.(Island-wide in targeted schools). </p><p> </p><p>E.Construction/restoration of dwellings: Ties in with </p><p>the GoSL\'s efforts to relocate IDPs, particularly those </p><p>living in welfare centers. Some 20 percent of the </p><p>estimated 800,000 Sri Lankans who were displaced at the </p><p>start of 2002 lived in welfare centers, some for as long </p><p>as 10 years. For many, the decision on whether to return </p><p>to their places of origin, or settle somewhere else on </p><p>state-provided land, hinges on the availability of </p><p>housing.  Possible opportunities for employment </p><p>generation, cash for work.  Notional figure: 25,000 </p><p>families at $1,000 per dwelling: US$2.5 Million. (north </p><p>and east). </p><p> </p><p>F.Micro-enterprise financing: The overwhelming </p><p>majority of IDP/refugee returnees, as well as families in </p><p>host communities, support themselves through agriculture </p><p>and fisheries. Sustainable livelihoods will require </p><p>getting funds into the hands of NGOs for micro-lending to </p><p>small farmers and fisherfolk to purchase agricultural </p><p>inputs such as seeds, fertilizer; no pesticides with </p><p>USAID funds), and fisherfolk to purchase nets, or to </p><p>repair boats. Funds should be on-lent at interest rates </p><p>prevailing at banks in the locality. Ideally packaged </p><p>with business development skills, and paired with </p><p>capacity building for local Farmer Organizations (FOs). </p><p>Notional cost US$1 Million </p><p>(north, east and south) </p><p> </p><p>Total Notional Figure: US $9.2 million. </p><p> </p><p>Prospective partners: The following USPVOs or their </p><p>international affiliates are represented in Sri Lanka: </p><p>CARE/International, Save the Children Fund (UK), and </p><p>World Vision.  Each however needs to be asked about </p><p>contacts and/or partnerships with Sri Lankan PVOs or </p><p>self-help societies in the northeast and the southwest. </p><p>UNICEF would also be a potentially excellent partner, as </p><p>would WFP for food-for-work. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
