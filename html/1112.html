<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001693 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2010 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PREL, ETRD, SR, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH DISCOURAGED ABOUT EU EFFORT TO DEFINE FRY </p><p>WHITE LIST </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 103909 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS STEPHEN R. KELLY; REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY:  DUTCH MFA OFFICIALS ARE DISCOURAGED AT THE </p><p>VERY SLOW AND POOR QUALITY EU EFFORT TO DEFINE A FRY WHITE </p><p>LIST TO BUTTRESS THE SANCTIONS REGIME.  THEY NOTE A CLEAR </p><p>LACK OF FRENCH, ITALIAN AND GREEK EFFORT TO MEET EU POLITICAL </p><p>COMMITMENTS TO DEFINE A MEANINGFUL LIST AND EXPECT THE END </p><p>PRODUCT TO BE OF QUESTIONABLE REAL ENFORCEMNT VALUE. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THEY SAY THEY ARE AT LEAST RELIEVED THAT THE EU </p><p>IS NOT NOW ARGUING ABOUT HOW TO DISMANTLE THE "ENERGY FOR </p><p>DEMOCRACY" PROGRAM.  THEY CAUTION THAT, SHOULD THE TENSION IN </p><p>BELGRADE SOON SUBSIDE, STRONG EU MEMBER STATE PRESSURE TO </p><p>WATER DOWN FINANCIAL SANCTION EFFORTS AND THE OIL DELIVERY </p><p>BAN WILL START REAPPEARING IN EU PROCEEDINGS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  IN 6/5 DISCUSSIONS WITH MFA BALKANS OFFICE AND EU </p><p>AFFAIRS OFFICIALS, THE DUTCH EXPRESSED A BROAD </p><p>DISSATISFACTION WITH THE EU\'S EFFORT TO DEFINE A FRY </p><p>SANCTIONS "WHITE LIST." THEY CONCUR THAT THE EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMISSION IS SEVERELY UNDER-RESOURCED TO PERFORM THE TASK, </p><p>BUT SEE THAT STAFFING OBSTACLE AS SECONDARY TO GENERAL EU </p><p>MEMBER STATE RELUCTANCE TO PROVIDE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS </p><p>THAT MATCH POLITICAL COMMITMENTS.  MFA EU COORDINATION </p><p>OFFICIALS STATED THAT, WHILE IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE EU </p><p>AT LEAST IS EMBARKING ON A SANCTIONS REGIME, THERE IS STILL </p><p>BROAD TENSION BETWEEN MANY MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION </p><p>OVER THE QUESTION OF WITH WHOM GENERAL ENFORCEMENT </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION POWERS LIE.  TO THIS THEY ADD THAT THERE IS </p><p>LITTLE REAL CONSENSUS TO ADD TEETH TO THE POLITICAL </p><p>STATEMENTS ABOUT THE EU FRY SANCTIONS REGIME.  THE DUTCH </p><p>REPORT A CONTINUING CORE OF UK/NL RESOLVE TO PUSH FOR A </p><p>COMMISSION-LED EU SANCTIONS REGIME THAT FINANCIALLY PRESSURES </p><p>MILOSEVIC.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY ARE TO QUICK TO NOTE </p><p>THEIR EFFORTS ARE OFFSET BY BROAD EU SLUGGISHNESS ON THE </p><p>QUESTION AND ANIMOSITY TO SUCH STEPS BY PARIS, ROME AND </p><p>ATHENS. </p><p>THE DUTCH ALSO FREELY CONCEDE THAT EVEN THEY LACK THE </p><p>PERSONNEL TO DO MUCH MORE ON SANCTIONS ENFORCEMENT THAN THEY </p><p>ALREADY DO.  THEY SAY THAT THEY CANNOT EASILY SURGE BEYOND </p><p>THE 3-4 FULL-TIME EQUIVALENTS THAT THEY JOINTLY DEDICATE TO </p><p>THE EFFORT BETWEEN THE FOREIGN, FINANCE AND COMMERCE </p><p>MINISTRIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C)  AS A CASE IN POINT, DUTCH OFFICIALS HIGHLIGHT THE </p><p>DUTCH AND UK STRONG VETTING EFFORTS ON THE WHITE LIST. THE UK </p><p>HAS DEMARCHED EU STATES TO WORK HARD TO MEET THE JUNE 30 </p><p>DEADLINE AND PRESENT CREDIBLE CANDIDATE BUSINESSES. THE DUTCH </p><p>SAY THAT THEY HAVE ONLY SUBMITTED TWO NAMES FOR COMMISSION </p><p>CONSIDERATION FOR THE WHITE LIST.  UNDERCUTTING THIS </p><p>SERIOUSNESS OF APPROACH, THEY REPORT THAT STOCKHOLM HAS </p><p>SUBMITTED A SLATE OF 2,500 TO 3,000 CANDIDATE COMPANIES WHILE </p><p>PARIS\' SUBMISSIONS WERE MEASURED IN WEIGHT, COMING IN AT </p><p>25-30 KILOS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C)  ACCORDINGLY, THE DUTCH PREDICT THAT THE JUNE 20 REVIEW </p><p>MEETING SET TO ORGANIZE THE JUNE 30 ANNOUNCEMENT LIKELY WILL </p><p>OVERSEE COMPILATION OF A POORLY VETTED LIST THAT MEETS THE EU </p><p>POLITICAL COMMITMENT TO DEFINE SUCH A PRODUCT, BUT WHICH WILL </p><p>LACK CREDIBILITY AS A REAL ENFORCEMENT TOOL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C)  SEVERAL MFA OFFICIALS FAMILIAR WITH RECENT EU </p><p>DELIBERATIONS ON THE BALKANS AND SANCTIONS HAVE MADE CLEAR </p><p>THE LIMITS THAT THEY PERCEIVE THE EU IS REACHING ON BALKANS </p><p>SANCTIONS.  THEY COMMENT THAT, WHILE EU LEADERS POLITICALLY </p><p>WOULD FEEL VULNERABLE IF THEY SAID NOTHING IN THE FACE OF </p><p>BELGRADE\'S ONGOING REPRESSION, THERE IS STILL NO BROAD EU </p><p>RESOLVE TO MATCH WORDS WITH ENFORCEMENT DEEDS.  THEY ADD THAT </p><p>UNTIL THAT RESOLVE MATERIALIZES IT IS NOT WORTH THE EFFORT OF </p><p>TRYING TO SECOND PERSONNEL TO THE COMMISSION OR CHIP IN FROM </p><p>SCARCE NATIONAL RESOURCES WITH VETTING THE WHITE LIST DRAFT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) COMMENT: DESPITE THE GENUINE DUTCH DISCOURAGEMENT OVER </p><p>DEFINING THE WHITE LIST, THEY STILL CAUTIOUSLY IMPLY THAT THE </p><p>U.S. MIGHT CONSIDER BEING GLAD FOR WHAT WE HAVE: THAT IS, </p><p>THE MOMENTARY ABSENCE OF AN ALL-OUT EU DRIVE TO DISMANTLE THE </p><p>EXISTING FRY SANCTIONS REGIME.  THEY SIGNAL THAT WE SHOULD </p><p>NOT UNDERESTIMATE HOW CLOSE TO THE SURFACE THOSE SENTIMENTS </p><p>ARE IN EUROPE.  IT IS PROBABLY WORTH NOTING THAT THE DUTCH </p><p>ALSO SEEM TO BE TIRING OF WADING UPSTREAM AGAINST A STRONG </p><p>CURRENT OF FRENCH, ITALIAN AND GREEK NEGATIVE SENTIMENT. IT </p><p>IS CLEAR THAT, IN DISCUSSIONS OF EU FRY SANCTIONS </p><p>DELIBERATIONS, THEY ALSO ARE TAKING PAINS TO DEFLECT </p><p>ANTICIPATED U.S. PRESSURE AWAY FROM THE HAGUE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>FENDRICK </p><p></p></div>
