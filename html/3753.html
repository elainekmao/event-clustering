<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005355 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, September 18, </p><p>highlight the "skeptical" U.S. reaction to Iraq\'s </p><p>acceptance of the unconditional return of the weapons </p><p>inspectors.  Stories focus on President Bush\'s remarks </p><p>of September 17 that the Security Council "must not be </p><p>fooled" by Iraq\'s "questionable promise" and calling </p><p>on the international community to "deal with" the </p><p>Iraqi President.  All papers also highlight Jordan\'s </p><p>official reaction to Iraq\'s decision, which praised </p><p>the Iraqi decision as "a positive step towards the </p><p>resumption of constructive dialogue between Iraq and </p><p>the United Nations."  Majority of editorial </p><p>commentaries praise Iraq\'s "intelligent" decision, but </p><p>warn that the U.S. remains intent on pursuing </p><p>hostilities against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "A sigh of relief" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (09/18) editorializes:  "Some in the </p><p>region are sighing with relief, although the feeling </p><p>would seem temporary.  Iraq\'s eleventh hour decision </p><p>to allow U.N. weapons inspectors back was welcomed in </p><p>Jordan, embraced in the rest of the Arab world, and </p><p>hailed by China and Russia.  But it was met with </p><p>suspicion and skepticism in London and Washington. </p><p>Jordan and most Arab countries have repeated over the </p><p>past few weeks that Iraq\'s unconditional acceptance of </p><p>U.N. arms inspectors would make it much more difficult </p><p>for Washington to justify a war.  Much more difficult </p><p>does not mean impossible.  The Iraqi leadership made a </p><p>wise and timely decision yesterday.  It did its part </p><p>to avoid a war.  At this stage, peace-loving nations </p><p>can only take Iraq\'s commitment to allow U.N. </p><p>inspectors back at face value." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The possibility of a war still stands" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(09/18):  "Baghdad\'s unconditional acceptance of the </p><p>return of the inspectors does change the climate of </p><p>the political confrontation with the United States and </p><p>the Security Council.  Yet, it is too early to </p><p>conclude that the crisis has taken a different turn </p><p>from that of American military aggression against </p><p>Iraq.  The possibility of a war is still high, because </p><p>Washington wants to oust the regime.  That is its main </p><p>objective and the issue of the return of the </p><p>inspectors is nothing but a pretext." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Was Baghdad successful in buying some time?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(09/18):  "The problem with the Iraqi decision is that </p><p>it came in the eleventh hour.  This gives the </p><p>impression that it is a `maneuver\' and not an </p><p>`initiative\'.  This is the basis for the American and </p><p>British rejection of the Iraqi decision.  I assume we </p><p>are going to hear much more in the next few days about </p><p>Iraq `lacking seriousness\' and the `maneuvering\' </p><p>aspect of the Iraqi decision.  Needless to say, Iraq </p><p>managed to buy itself some time and this is good in </p><p>itself, particularly if this time is used well to </p><p>launch a diplomatic mission that eliminates the ghost </p><p>of war altogether." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The repercussions of the Iraqi decision" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Basem Sakijha writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(09/18):  "Changing the Iraqi regime remains the </p><p>objective of the U.S. policy.  It is an objective that </p><p>cannot be attained by a Security Council resolution. </p><p>Therefore, the United States will continue to focus on </p><p>marginal issues, opening one file after another, until </p><p>the final provocation that will be the justification </p><p>for the war." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Washington\'s utmost hallucination" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(09/18):  "No one can understand or accept the </p><p>American justifications for striking Iraq, </p><p>particularly after Iraq agreed to the unconditional </p><p>return of the inspectors.  What does Washington want? </p><p>Washington wants Iraqi oil.  It wants a regime that </p><p>achieves all its interests in the region.  It wants to </p><p>destroy any weapons that can threaten Israel.  Iraq\'s </p><p>decision marks a very intelligent step.  It exposed </p><p>America\'s lies completely.  It is now up to the Arab </p><p>countries and Europe to employ the Iraqi stand in </p><p>favor of all concerned.  Washington can continue its </p><p>hallucinations about war, but it is important that no </p><p>Arab or European country listen to those </p><p>hallucinations.  No one wants to start a war in the </p><p>region except Israel,  American oil companies, and </p><p>some of the Iraqi opposition groups." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
