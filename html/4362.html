<p>UNCLAS HANOI 002777 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PINS, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  ANOTHER MINISTERIAL-LEVEL VICTIM OF NAM CAM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. FBIS SEP 20021118000011   B. HANOI 1795 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  OFFICIAL VIETNAMESE MEDIA (REF A) AND FOREIGN MEDIA </p><p>HAVE CARRIED REPORTS OF THE NOVEMBER 15 DISMISSAL OF VICE </p><p>MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY MAJOR GENERAL HOANG NGOC NHAT </p><p>FOR "BREACHES OF THE LAW" LINKED TO THE NAM CAM "MAFIA" </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02777  181011Z </p><p>CASE.  NHAT, WHO WAS ALSO DEMOTED TO COLONEL BUT ONLY </p><p>"DISCIPLINED" BY -- NOT FORMALLY SACKED FROM -- THE </p><p>MINISTRY, HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE OFFICIAL WHO IN 1997 </p><p>SIGNED TRUONG VAN CAM\'S INITIAL RELEASE FROM PRISON EIGHT </p><p>MONTHS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.  REF B REPORTED ON THE EARLIER </p><p>DISMISSALS AND EVENTUAL EXPULSION FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>OF TWO OTHER HIGH FLIERS -- VICE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY </p><p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL BUI QUOC HUY AND DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE </p><p>VOICE OF VIETNAM TRAN MAI HANH -- FOLLOWING THE SIXTH PARTY </p><p>PLENUM JULY 4-15.  ANOTHER, PHAM SI CHIEN, WAS FORMALLY </p><p>DISMISSED AS VICE GENERAL PROCURATOR OF THE SUPREME PEOPLE\'S </p><p>PROCURACY IN AUGUST. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  TRIALS IN THE NAM CAM CASE ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY ON DECEMBER 10 AND CONTINUE UNTIL JANUARY </p><p>28.  AT LEAST 156 PEOPLE WILL BE ON TRIAL, INCLUDING HUY, </p><p>HANH, AND CHIEN.  IT APPEARS THAT NHAT WILL NOT BE </p><p>PROSECUTED.  THERE IS CONSIDERABLE INTEREST AMONG FOREIGN </p><p>JOURNALISTS TO COVER THE TRIALS, BUT THE GVN HAS NOT YET </p><p>ANNOUNCED WHETHER THE COURTS WILL BE OPEN FOR THE MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  IN HIS OPENING REMARKS AT THE SECOND SESSION OF THE </p><p>11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON NOVEMBER 12, PRIME MINISTER PHAN </p><p>VAN KHAI SPECIFICALLY CITED "NAM CAM" AS A NOTORIOUS EXAMPLE </p><p>OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES PENETRATING INTO THE WORKINGS OF THE </p><p>STATE APPARATUS, AND NOTED THE NEED TO HAVE "TRUSTWORTHY" </p><p>PEOPLE WORKING IN SECURITY-RELATED ORGANS.  GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH ADMITTED TO THE CLOSING SESSION OF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE SEVENTH PLENUM OF THE 9TH PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 9 THAT "ORGANIZED CRIMINALS HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH </p><p>CORRUPT AND DEGENERATE OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02777  181011Z </p><p>INCLUDING A NUMBER OF HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS," A SUBJECT OF </p><p>"GREAT CONCERN" TO THE PARTY AND STATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  COMMENT:  THE CPV AND GVN WILL ATTEMPT TO USE THE </p><p>UPCOMING MASS TRIALS RELATED TO NAM CAM AS SHOWCASES OF </p><p>THEIR SERIOUSNESS IN CRACKING DOWN ON CORRUPTION AND IN </p><p>DEMONSTRATING THAT EVEN SENIOR OFFICIALS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO </p><p>PROSECUTION.  HEAVY SENTENCES CAN BE EXPECTED, INCLUDING A </p><p>POSSIBLE DEATH PENALTY AT LEAST FOR NAM CAM HIMSELF. </p><p>FOREIGN JOURNALISTS ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THEY WILL BE ALLOWED </p><p>TO WITNESS THE TRIALS, GIVEN POSSIBLE GVN WORRIES ABOUT WHAT </p><p>NAM CAM MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO SAY IN HIS OWN DEFENSE (I.E., </p><p>ABOUT HIS ALLEGED LINKS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS OF VERY HIGH </p><p>RANKING CPV AND GVN OFFICIALS).   PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE </p><p>CASE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE HIGH, HOWEVER (AT LEAST IN </p><p>HANOI), NOR IS IT LIKELY THAT EVEN SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTIONS </p><p>OF THESE CASES -- A FOREGONE CONCLUSION IN THIS JUDICIAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT -- WILL WIN BACK MUCH PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE </p><p>SANCTITY OF GVN AND CPV OFFICIALS AT ALL LEVELS. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
