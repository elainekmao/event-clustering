<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000883 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS; OES/ENV </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA:ABENAISSA </p><p>KATHMANDU FOR EST HUB </p><p> </p><p>E.O 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, ECON, EAID, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES AIR QUALITY </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Preliminary studies show a significant </p><p>reduction in Colombo\'s ambient air lead levels after </p><p>phasing out leaded gasoline in June, 2002.  The </p><p>Government will further improve urban air quality by </p><p>introducing new vehicle emission and fuel quality </p><p>standards.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>NO MORE LEADED FUEL </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Leaded gasoline had been a growing source of </p><p>ambient air pollution in Sri Lanka\'s urban areas.  By </p><p>2001, Sri Lanka was burning 244,000 metric tons of </p><p>leaded gasoline.  According to estimates, 50% of the </p><p>gasoline in Sri Lanka was consumed in Colombo, </p><p>releasing approximately 25 tons of lead into the </p><p>atmosphere annually.  As a result, lead pollution was </p><p>a major health concern, with studies indicating high </p><p>blood lead levels in Colombo residents compared to </p><p>those in rural areas. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Implementation of existing air quality management </p><p>laws and regulations was very slow, until recently. </p><p>Lead-free gasoline was introduced in 1997 with a </p><p>planned total phase-out by 2005.  Under the current </p><p>government, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) </p><p>accelerated the plan by discontinuing the production </p><p>and sale of leaded gasoline in mid-2002.  Although no </p><p>detailed statistical analyses are available, a study </p><p>sponsored by the USAID/US-Asia Environmental </p><p>Partnership Program (US-AEP) showed ambient lead </p><p>levels have dropped 80% six months after phasing out </p><p>lead in gasoline. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Measures of particulate lead, from vehicle </p><p>emissions and roads, burning of garbage, industrial </p><p>emissions and soil, also show a declining trend when </p><p>compared with historical data.  More importantly, </p><p>according to preliminary studies, introduction of </p><p>unleaded gasoline has contributed to a marked (86%) </p><p>reduction in blood lead levels in traffic policemen. </p><p>This indicates the magnitude of the health impact and </p><p>the benefits of the lead reduction program. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER INITIATIVES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  In order to facilitate the air quality management </p><p>programs, an Air Quality Management Center (AirMac) </p><p>was formed in November 2001 under the Ministry of </p><p>Environment and Natural Resources.  Since then AirMac </p><p>has been instrumental in improving stakeholder </p><p>participation.  The present focus of the AirMac is on </p><p>an accelerated program to implement emission </p><p>standards in January 2004 and developing a Clean Air </p><p>2005 action plan.  World Bank and USAID/US-AEP are </p><p>the two major donors helping Sri Lanka air quality </p><p>improvement programs. </p><p> </p><p>6.  A recent World Bank sponsored study co-ordinated </p><p>by the AirMac found fine particulate matter as the </p><p>air pollutant of greatest concern in urban areas. </p><p>The high sulfur dioxide content, found mainly in </p><p>diesel fuel is directly related to particulate matter </p><p>level.  Poor vehicle maintenance practices, lack of </p><p>vehicle testing programs, and the import of diesel </p><p>vehicles (due to a petroleum pricing policy favoring </p><p>diesel) have contributed to increased air pollution. </p><p>Emissions of smoke and soot from diesel vehicles, and </p><p>from petrol vehicles equipped with two stroke engines </p><p>(the ubiquitous trishaws), are believed to be among </p><p>the main sources of particulate matter emissions in </p><p>urban areas. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The GSL hopes to reduce these pollutants through </p><p>the new Clean Air 2005 action plan, which aims to </p><p>reduce vehicle emissions and improve fuel quality. </p><p>New emission standards will apply for all vehicles </p><p>from July 1, 2003.  Euro II equivalent standards will </p><p>apply for imports.  Less stringent emission standards </p><p>will apply for in use vehicles from July 1, 2003 with </p><p>the intention of moving towards Euro II and Euro III </p><p>standards by 2007 and 2010, respectively. </p><p>Arrangements to establish 200 vehicle-testing centers </p><p>throughout the country are underway.  According to </p><p>Transport Ministry sources, annual mobile emission </p><p>certificates will be mandatory for all motor vehicles </p><p>beginning in January 2004.  In addition, Sri Lanka is </p><p>considering banning the importation of two stroke </p><p>trishaws. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Also, new (Euro II equivalent) fuel quality </p><p>standards will apply from July 1, 2003 for gasoline. </p><p>Euro III standards will apply for gasoline in 2007. </p><p>Diesel standards (now at Euro I) will also be </p><p>improved gradually to Euro II and Euro III levels </p><p>between 2004 and 2007, allowing adequate time for the </p><p>CPC to launch fuel reformulation programs in its </p><p>refinery.  The AirMac will launch an independent </p><p>auditing mechanism to monitor standards of fuel </p><p>available in the market.  In addition, the GSL is </p><p>planning to launch a power plant emission-monitoring </p><p>program and to carry out health impact assessments </p><p>relating to air pollution. </p><p> </p><p>9.  US-AEP recently sponsored a fleet </p><p>characterization study to measure emissions.  A </p><p>remote sensing measurement technology developed by </p><p>Environmental Systems Products, Tucson, AZ is being </p><p>used for this study.  Results of this study will help </p><p>in deciding priority vehicle types, makes and years </p><p>of manufacture to phase in the emission standards in </p><p>January 2004.  Understanding fleet characteristics is </p><p>necessary to implement vehicle testing with minimum </p><p>social and economic impediments for vehicle owners, </p><p>and to avoid a potential political backlash on the </p><p>air quality program. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Comment:  This is a field in which the </p><p>combination of US and multilateral assistance with US </p><p>technology has generated measurable improvements in </p><p>the economy of Sri Lanka and the health of its </p><p>citizens.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
