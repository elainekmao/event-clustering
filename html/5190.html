(S)  U.N. HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR IN IRAQ, RAMIRO LOPES </p><p>DA SILVA, REPORTS THAT THE FRAGILITY OF THE IRAQI SOCIETY IS </p><p>EXTREME AND MILITARY ACTION THAT DISRUPTS THE CURRENT SYSTEMS </p><p>WILL CREATE A DISASTROUS SITUATION. THE U.N. IS PLANNING ON </p><p>THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE NORTH WILL BE SHIELDED FROM MILITARY </p><p>ACTION AND THAT THE SOUTH/CENTRAL REGIONS WILL BEAR THE BRUNT </p><p>OF ANY ATTACKS.  SOME PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN U.N. </p><p>PREPARATIONS, BUT LACK OF RESOURCES ARE A STUMBLING BLOCK. </p><p>IF WE WANT WFP TO ASSIST EARLY ON IN RESURRECTING OR </p><p>REJUVENATING THE CURRENT FOOD DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, SOME </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE U.N. SECURITY COORDINATION OFFICE </p><p>(UNSECOORD) WOULD BE HELPFUL.  WFP CONTINUES TO BE CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT POSSIBLE BIOLOGICAL AND/OR CHEMICAL SPILLS AND LEAKS TO </p><p>ITS STAFF AND/OR FOOD COMMODITIES.  WFP REQUESTS FEEDBACK ON </p><p>ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE U.N. COUNTRY TEAM IN IRAQ AND ITS </p><p>PLANNING.  SEE PARA 11.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>U.N. HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR IN IRAQ SHARES PLANNING </p><p>ASSUMPTIONS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SENIOR EMERGENCY COORDINATOR (SEC) R. DAVIS IN THE </p><p>U.S. MISSION/ROME MET WITH WFP STAFF ON JANUARY 14 TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE IRAQ PLANNING MEETING THAT WAS HELD ON JANUARY 12/13 IN </p><p>GENEVA AMONG THE U.N. AGENCIES AND OFFICES, INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (ICRC), INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION </p><p>OF THE RED CRESCENT (IFRC), AND NON-GOVERNEMNTAL ORGANIZATION </p><p>(NGO) GROUPS, I.E. ICVA AND INTERACTION.  THE U.N. </p><p>HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR IN IRAQ, RAMIRO LOPES DA SILVA, AND </p><p>THE U.N. RESIDENT COORDINATORS ALSO ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) ACCORDING TO WFP, LOPES DA SILVA REPORTED TO THE </p><p>GROUP THAT THE FRAGILITY OF THE IRAQI SOCIETY IS EXTREME AND </p><p>MILITARY ACTION THAT DISRUPTS THE CURRENT SYSTEMS WILL CREATE </p><p>A DISASTROUS SITUATION.   THE U.N. IS ASSUMING THAT THE NORTH </p><p>WILL BE SHIELDED FROM MILITARY ACTION, HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE </p><p>NOTED THAT ALL FOOD DISTRIBUTED IN THE NORTH FUNNELS THROUGH </p><p>THE SOUTH/CENTRAL REGIONS (UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE GOI\'S </p><p>MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT) BEFORE IT REACHES THE WAREHOUSES IN </p><p>MOSUL OR KIRKUK, WHERE WFP TAKES OVER THE TRUCKING </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES.  THEREFORE, LOPES DA SILVA POINTED OUT IT </p><p>PROBABLY WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE ALTERNATE LOGISTICAL </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS FOR PROVIDING FOOD TO THE NORTH, ALONG WITH </p><p>CREATING ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY LINES FROM SYRIA, TURKEY, OR IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) LOPES DA SILVA RELAYED THAT THE U.N. IS ASSUMING THAT </p><p>THE CENTRAL/SOUTH REGIONS WOULD BE THE POINT OF MAIN MILITARY </p><p>ACTION, POSSIBLY CAUSING THE 5.6 MILLION INHABITANTS OF </p><p>BAGHDAD TO BE CUT OFF FROM ELECTRICITY, WATER, SEWAGE, AND </p><p>FUEL.  MINES ARE A POTENTIAL PROBLEM IN MOVEMENTS FROM THE </p><p>CENTRAL REGION TO THE NORTH.
