<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001964 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION U.S./IRAQI STANDOFF; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under the headline "Will Bush attack Iraq?" the </p><p>      August 25 edition of the pro-government weekly "The </p><p>      Sunday Mirror" carried the following article in the </p><p>      "Scrutator," the unsigned column written by publisher </p><p>      Ibbo Mandaza: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "U.S. President George W. Bush\'s plan to wage war </p><p>      against Iraq is facing increasing dissent at home and </p><p>      abroad.  Already, the entire Arab League. . .has </p><p>      expressed strong opposition to any proposed military </p><p>      attach on Iraq. . .  Furthermore, U.S. plans to isolate </p><p>      Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein will now be damaged by </p><p>      an economic and trade cooperation agreement between </p><p>      Russia and Iraq concluded last Sunday.  While Russia </p><p>      insists that the US$40 billion deal will not violate </p><p>      the UN sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 </p><p>      invasion of Kuwait, the agreement is certain to damage </p><p>      relations between Moscow and Washington already cooled </p><p>      by Russian plans to step up nuclear cooperation with </p><p>      Iran, part of Bush\'s `axis of evil.\' </p><p> </p><p>      "In general, most of the allies of the U.S. are </p><p>      resisting the drum beating in Washington for </p><p>      military action against Iraq, arguing that an </p><p>      invasion cannot be justified without firm proof </p><p>      that Iraq is developing weapons of mass </p><p>      destruction.  On the other hand, such `proof\' </p><p>      cannot be forthcoming without the `weapons </p><p>      inspection\' by the UN, a step now forestalled by </p><p>      the current war rhetoric against Iraq.  For, </p><p>      Iraq would be foolish to allow `weapons </p><p>      inspection\' while the U.S. is preparing to </p><p>      attack it.  However it is within Britain, the </p><p>      U.S.\'s closest ally, that there is growing </p><p>      opposition, not only to the idea of attacking </p><p>      Iraq but also to the foreign and security policy </p><p>      of a super power that has grown so bellicose in </p><p>      its unipolar self-indulgence, that it has become </p><p>      blind to the contradictions that characterize </p><p>      contemporary globalization.  Suddenly, even its </p><p>      key allies are reminding the U.S. of the need to </p><p>      adhere to the rules of the UN Security Council, </p><p>      including, at least by implication, a warning </p><p>      against the callous disregard for the </p><p>      sovereignty and national independence of </p><p>      (smaller) member states of the United Nations." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
