<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006650 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, ASEC, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ MOVES AGAINST ARMED GROUP IN MA\'AN; CURFEW, </p><p>HOUSE TO HOUSE SEARCHES CONTINUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6535 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM GREGORY L. BERRY. REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  SUMMARY.  As of mid-day November 12, the search for </p><p>members of an armed Islamic group in the southern Jordanian </p><p>city of Ma\'an continues.  Jordanian security forces entered </p><p>Ma\'an on November 10 after a heavily armed gang refused to </p><p>give up its leader Mohammad Shalibi (aka Abu Sayyaf) </p><p>(reftel).  In ensuing gun battles, at least four individuals </p><p>associated with the group and a PSD warrant officer were </p><p>killed, and several on both sides were wounded.  The group </p><p>appears to be associated with the Islamic group </p><p>Takfir-al-Hijra.  According to the GOJ, calm has been </p><p>restored to the city, although the operation to find Shalibi </p><p>continues with heavily armed gunmen still at large and the </p><p>security services on shoot-to-kill orders.  The city remains </p><p>under curfew.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU).  On November 10, GOJ security forces entered </p><p>Ma\'an.  Upon entering the city to conduct a house to house </p><p>search for Abu Sayyaf, GOJ forces were apparently confronted </p><p>by the armed supporters of Abu Sayyaf, and gunfire ensued. </p><p>According to media reports, four from Abu Sayyaf\'s group and </p><p>one PSD warrant officer were confirmed killed, and there were </p><p>additional casualties on both sides. Road blocks were put in </p><p>place around the city, and the Desert Highway north and south </p><p>of Ma\'an was closed. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  On November 12, Int Min Qaftan Majali announced that </p><p>"calm had been restored to Ma\'an."  The GOJ reported that 25 </p><p>arrests were made, among them Egyptians and Iraqis who </p><p>allegedly were caught attempting to smuggle weapons to the </p><p>Ma\'an gang.  Abu Sayyaf and several compatriots, reportedly </p><p>armed with RPGs and machine guns, remain at large.  There are </p><p>unconfirmed (comment: and unlikely) rumors that Abu Sayyaf </p><p>escaped to Aqaba.  A curfew on city residents continues. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C).  Al-Jazeera reported Nov 11 that one of their </p><p>correspondents, Yasser Abu Halale, as well as Arab al-Youm </p><p>reporter Samer Abu Halale, was arrested.  Yasser Abu Halale </p><p>was reportedly charged with violating the GOJ-imposed ban on </p><p>reporting for al-Jazeera.  The regional and international </p><p>media has issued spurious reports linking the Ma\'an situation </p><p>with the assassination of Larry Foley and/or with potential </p><p>forthcoming USG operations in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  Former Member of Parliament Dr. Abdullah Al-Jazi, a </p><p>leading member of a pro-regime Haweitat tribe located outside </p><p>of Ma\'an, said Ma\'an has had to endure this group of </p><p>"smugglers and criminals" for years, and most people in Ma\'an </p><p>will be happy to see them gone.  Dr. Al-Jazi was confident </p><p>that the GOJ would be able to manage the situation in the </p><p>short-term, but was not confident that the PM is committed to </p><p>resuscitating the poverty stricken area of Ma\'an in the </p><p>long-term. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  COMMENT.  The situation in Ma\'an appears to be a </p><p>localized incident, and there are no current indications that </p><p>the challenge to the GOJ there is spreading elsewhere.  On </p><p>the street, rumors surrounding the "real reason" for the </p><p>timing of the GOJ action in Ma\'an persist, although most </p><p>people see the situation in Ma-an for what it appears to be: </p><p>a rebellious group of gangsters wrongfully challenging the </p><p>authority of the GOJ.  With Abu Sayyaf and/or his men </p><p>possibly holed up in a situation akin to "Butch Cassidy and </p><p>the Sundance Kid", additional casualties are possible.  We </p><p>will continue to monitor the situation. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
