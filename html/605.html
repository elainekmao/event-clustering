<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TOKYO 09361 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR CD DEL </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA FOR UNVIE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINR, PINS, PROP, MNUC, KN, KS, JA </p><p>SUBJECT:  CHOSEN SOREN ACTIVITIES IN JAPAN FOLLOWING </p><p>U.S.-DPRK NUCLEAR TALKS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  NORTH KOREA HAS INSTRUCTED KOREANS WHO </p><p>RESIDE IN JAPAN BUT ARE VISITING NORTH KOREA TO RETURN </p><p>TO JAPAN AND MAY NOT LET THEM VISIT NORTH KOREA UNTIL </p><p>THE END OF JULY.  KOREANS LIVING ABROAD HAVE BEEN </p><p>INSTRUCTED TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>INDOCTRINATION.  CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS IN JAPAN BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE DPRK THINKS INCREASED INDOCTRINATION IS </p><p>NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COUNTER POSSIBLE CORRUPTING </p><p>EFFECTS OF CONTACTS WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, WHICH </p><p>NORTH KOREA ALSO SEEMS TO BE SUPPORTING.  INCREASED </p><p>INDOCTRINATION MAY ALSO BE NECESSARY IF, AS SOME DPRK </p><p>BUREAUCRATS ADVISE, NORTH KOREA ADOPTS CERTAIN WESTERN </p><p>BUSINESS PRACTICES.  CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT </p><p>THE U.S.-DPRK TALKS DID NOT SOLVE IMPORTANT ISSUES </p><p>(IAEA INSPECTIONS).  THEY WORRY THAT THE NORTH MAY </p><p>BLOCK FURTHER COMPROMISE BY INSISTING ON "EQUAL" </p><p>TREATMENT (SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO INSPECT U.S. BASES). </p><p>NORTH KOREA IS ALSO USING A DIFFERENT TRANSLATION OF </p><p>THE POST-MEETING STATEMENT IN ORDER, APPARENTLY, TO </p><p>CONVINCE ITS PUBLIC THAT THE U.S. HAS AGREED TO </p><p>RESPECT THE KIM IL SUNG SYSTEM AND NOT JUST DPRK </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY.  PYONGYANG HAS ALSO ASKED CHOSEN SOREN TO </p><p>STUDY WAYS OF ACQUIRING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PEACEFUL </p><p>USE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY.  SOME CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THIS MAY INDICATE NORTH KOREA\'S INTENTION </p><p>TO FOREGO THE MILITARY ASPECT OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  HAJIME IZUMI (PROTECT STRICTLY), ASSOCIATE </p><p>PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SHIZUOKA, ON JUNE 18 </p><p>DISCUSSED CHOSEN SOREN\'S RECENT ACTIVITIES.  (IZUMI IS </p><p>A LONG-TIME EMBASSY CONTACT WITH GOOD ACCESS TO THE </p><p>CHOSEN SOREN ORGANIZATION.) </p><p> </p><p>KOREANS RESIDING IN JAPAN TOLD TO RETURN </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  IZUMI MET WITH CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS ON JUNE 14. </p><p>THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE DPRK ORDERED KOREANS WHO WERE </p><p>IN NORTH KOREA AT THE TIME BUT WHO PERMANENTLY RESIDE </p><p>IN JAPAN, TO RETURN TO JAPAN, BEGINNING ON JUNE 15. </p><p>KOREANS IN JAPAN WERE INFORMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE </p><p>ABLE TO TRAVEL TO NORTH KOREA UNTIL THE END OF JULY. </p><p>SOME HIGH-RANKING CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS, HOWEVER, WERE </p><p>ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN NORTH KOREA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SOME KOREAN RESIDENTS OF JAPAN RETURNED TO JAPAN </p><p>ON JUNE 10 ON A SHIP THAT ARRIVED IN NIIGATA.  SOME OF </p><p>THEM, ALONG WITH CHOSEN SOREN\'S SENIOR LEADERSHIP, </p><p>ATTENDED A SPECIAL CHOSEN SOREN MEETING IN TOKYO ON </p><p>JUNE 11.  IZUMI SAID THAT THE MEETING WAS PRIVATE AND </p><p>CLOSED.  THOSE RETURNING FROM NORTH KOREA SAID THAT </p><p>THE DPRK HAD INSTRUCTED CHOSEN SOREN TO INCREASE </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL INDOCTRINATION WITHIN THE KOREAN COMMUNITY </p><p>IN JAPAN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THIS INSTRUCTION, CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS NOTED, WAS </p><p>IN LINE WITH A STATEMENT KIM JONG IL MADE ON APRIL 27 </p><p>IN A PRIVATE SPEECH TO SENIOR CADRES IN WHICH HE SAID </p><p>THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO STRENGTHEN IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>TEACHING IN ORDER TO RAISE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF </p><p>"ORDINARY" KOREANS AND OF KOREANS LIVING OVERSEAS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS FOUND THAT THE NEW DIRECTIVE </p><p>AND THE APRIL 27 KIM JONG IL STATEMENT SEEMED TO </p><p>CONTRADICT A KJI STATEMENT OF MARCH 1991, IN WHICH HE </p><p>SAID THAT KOREANS LIVING ABROAD FACE DIFFERENT </p><p>EXPERIENCES AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ALLOWED SOME </p><p>FLEXIBILITY IN ADJUSTING TO THEIR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p>THEY ALSO RECALLED AN AUGUST 15, 1992 STATEMENT BY KIM </p><p>IL SUNG (ANOTHER PRIVATE SPEECH) IN WHICH THE GREAT </p><p>LEADER SAID THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD ADOPT A MORE OPEN </p><p>POLICY TOWARD THE OUTSIDE WORLD, SUPPOSEDLY USING THE </p><p>KOREAN EXPRESSION "KAEBANG," WHICH MEANS "OPEN DOOR." </p><p>(IZUMI COMMENTED THAT THIS MAY BE THE ONLY TIME KIM IL </p><p>SUNG HAS USED THIS EXPRESSION IN SUCH A CONTEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  CHOSEN SOREN, IZUMI RELATED, MANAGED TO RECONCILE </p><p>THE NEW DIRECTIVE ON INCREASED IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>INDOCTRINATION WITH THE PREVIOUS APPARENT POLICY OF </p><p>ENCOURAGING SOME OPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF OVERSEAS KOREANS.  CHOSEN </p><p>SOREN CONCLUDED THAT THE DPRK LEADERSHIP STILL FAVORED </p><p>OPENNESS BUT THAT, IN ORDER TO WARD OFF THE CORRUPTING </p><p>EFFECTS OF CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>INDOCTRINATION WOULD ALSO HAVE TO INCREASE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN IZUMI\'S VIEW, THE DPRK CONSIDERS INCREASED </p><p>INDOCTRINATION AS A WAY TO STRENGTHEN LOYALTY TO AND </p><p>BELIEF IN THE DPRK SYSTEM AND ALSO AS A MEANS OF </p><p>"PROTECTING" INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO CORRUPTING OUTSIDE </p><p>INFLUENCES. </p><p> </p><p>IN PYONGYANG . . . </p><p>------------------ </p><p>10.  IZUMI SAID THAT ANOTHER REASON FOR THE INCREASED </p><p>EMPHASIS ON IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING IS THAT, IN NORTH </p><p>KOREA, SOME BUREAUCRATS REPORTEDLY SUPPORT NORTH </p><p>KOREA\'S ADOPTING WESTERN BUSINESS PRACTICES IN ORDER </p><p>TO MAKE NORTH KOREA MORE ATTRACTIVE TO POTENTIAL </p><p>INVESTORS.  IZUMI SAID THAT, IN PARTICULAR, SOME </p><p>BUREAUCRATS ARE PUSHING FOR NORTH KOREA TO ACCEPT </p><p>WESTERN NOTIONS OF CONTRACT LAW.  HOWEVER, IDEOLOGUES </p><p>ARGUE THAT ACCEPTING SUCH PRACTICES WOULD THREATEN THE </p><p>PURITY OF NORTH KOREA\'S SYSTEM.  THEY THEREFORE OPPOSE </p><p>THE BUREAUCRATS\' SUGGESTION.  CHOSEN SOREN BELIEVES </p><p>THAT ONE WAY TO REFORM BUSINESS PRACTICES AND ALSO </p><p>MAINTAIN PURITY IS TO INCREASE INDOCTRINATION SO THAT </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF CORRUPTION CAN BE MINIMIZED.  (OR </p><p>SO THE THINKING GOES.) </p><p> </p><p>NORTH KOREANS IN JAPAN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>11.  IZUMI SAID THAT THE SYSTEM OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS RUN </p><p>BY CHOSEN SOREN IS RELATIVELY WELL-ORGANIZED.  THERE </p><p>ARE ABOUT 20 SUCH PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN JAPAN AS WELL AS </p><p>ONE PRIVATE UNIVERSITY IN THE TOKYO AREA CATERING TO </p><p>NORTH KOREANS.  IZUMI SAID THAT CHOSEN SOREN MAINTAINS </p><p>A MUCH STRONGER PRIVATE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAN DO KOREANS </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO SOUTH KOREA.  THUS, CHILDREN OF CHOSEN </p><p>SOREN MEMBERS PROBABLY RECEIVE MUCH STRONGER </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL INDOCTRINATION THAN DO CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS </p><p>ORIENTED TOWARDS THE ROK. </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-DPRK NUCLEAR TALKS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>12.  IZUMI SAID THAT NORTH KOREA USES A TRANSLATION OF </p><p>THE STATEMENT ISSUED AFTER THE RECENT NEW YORK TALKS </p><p>THAT DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE </p><p>VERSION.  (IZUMI WAS AWARE THAT THE LATTER IS </p><p>CONSIDERED THE "OFFICIAL" VERSION.)  CHOSEN SOREN, </p><p>EXPOSED TO THE ENGLISH AND JAPANESE VERSIONS, AS WELL </p><p>AS THE DPRK VERSION, DOES NOT CONSIDER THE TALKS TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS FOR THE NORTH.  CHOSEN SOREN </p><p>MEMBERS REALIZE THAT THE IAEA INSPECTION ISSUE IS </p><p>UNRESOLVED.  THEY BELIEVE IT HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT </p><p>NORTH KOREA WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO SUBMIT TO IAEA </p><p>INSPECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS THINK THAT NORTH KOREA WILL </p><p>REFER TO THOSE TERMS, IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE </p><p>STATEMENT, THAT CALL FOR "UNPREJUDICED, IMPARTIAL, AND </p><p>EQUAL" TREATMENT.  THEY WORRY THAT THE DPRK WILL REFER </p><p>TO THESE TERMS AND DEMAND "EQUAL" TREATMENT (E.G., THE </p><p>RIGHT TO INSPECT U.S. BASES) AND THEREBY MAKE </p><p>COMPROMISE DIFFICULT.  IZUMI SAID THAT CHOSEN SOREN </p><p>SEEMS TO WANT TO RESOLVE REMAINING NUCLEAR ISSUES </p><p>SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. </p><p> </p><p>14.  IZUMI SAID THAT THE NORTH KOREAN VERSION OF THE </p><p>STATEMENT DOES NOT CORRECTLY TRANSLATE "SOVEREIGNTY" </p><p>("SHUKEN" IN THE JAPANESE PRONUNCIATION OF THE SAME </p><p>CHINESE CHARACTERS USED ALSO IN KOREAN).  INSTEAD, THE </p><p>DPRK VERSION USES THE EXPRESSION "JISHUKEN," WHICH HAS </p><p>A MEANING CLOSER TO THE ENGLISH WORD "INDEPENDENCE." </p><p>IZUMI SAID THAT, IN KOREAN, "JISHUKEN" CAN ALSO MEAN </p><p>"NATIONAL SYSTEM" OR "INDEPENDENT NATIONAL SYSTEM." </p><p>THE USE OF THIS TERM, IZUMI SAID, INDICATES THAT NORTH </p><p>KOREA IS TRYING TO TELL ITS PEOPLE THAT THE U.S. HAS </p><p>AGREED TO RESPECT THE DPRK\'S "INDEPENDENT NATIONAL </p><p>SYSTEM" (I.E., THE KIM IL SUNG REGIME) RATHER THAN </p><p>SIMPLY ITS SOVEREIGNTY. </p><p> </p><p>15.  IZUMI ALSO NOTED THAT AT THE POST-MEETING PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE, THE DPRK REP REFERRED TO "SHUKEN," </p><p>"JISHUKEN," AND EACH COUNTRY\'S "DIFFERENT POLITICAL </p><p>SYSTEMS" AS MATTERS ON WHICH THE U.S. AND DPRK REACHED </p><p>AGREEMENT.  IZUMI SAID THAT THIS ALSO SHOWED THAT </p><p>NORTH KOREA WAS TRYING TO USE THE MEETING TO SHOW THE </p><p>NORTH KOREAN PUBLIC THAT THE U.S. HAS AGREED TO </p><p>RESPECT THE KIM IL SUNG SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>NON-MILITARY NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>16.  IZUMI SAID THAT PYONGYANG ALSO INSTRUCTED CHOSEN </p><p>SOREN TO STUDY WAYS OF COLLECTING MATERIAL (OF </p><p>WHATEVER ORIGIN) CONCERNING THE PEACEFUL USE OF </p><p>NUCLEAR ENERGY.  PYONGYANG DID NOT, HOWEVER, EXPLAIN </p><p>THE REASON FOR THIS INSTRUCTION.  IZUMI SAID THAT SOME </p><p>CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT NORTH KOREA MAY WANT </p><p>TO GIVE UP THE MILITARY ASPECT OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM </p><p>AND CONVERT TO PURELY CIVILIAN APPLICATIONS.  (IZUMI </p><p>SAID THAT CHOSEN SOREN SUPPORTED THIS IDEA, IF THIS IS </p><p>A CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE DPRK\'S INTENTIONS.) </p><p>CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS RECALLED THAT, FOLLOWING THE </p><p>FIRST IAEA INSPECTIONS IN JUNE 1992, THE DPRK\'S REP IN </p><p>GENEVA SAID THAT, IF THE WEST WERE TO HELP NORTH KOREA </p><p>DEVELOP A LIGHT WATER REACTOR SYSTEM, THE NORTH MIGHT </p><p>STOP ITS REPROCESSING PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARMACOST </p><p></p></div>
