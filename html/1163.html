<p>S E C R E T STATE 117658 </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR EMBASSY KHARTOUM OFFICE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 6/20/10 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, UNSC, SU, FR, NL, AR, BG </p><p>SUBJECT: SUDANESE INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: EDMUND HULL, DEPUTY COORDINATOR FOR </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM, S/CT. REASON: 1.5 (B) (C) (D) </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 113624 </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) DEPARTMENT UNDERSTANDS THAT THE HOST GOVERNMENTS AT </p><p>ADDRESSEE POSTS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO ENDORSE THE USG </p><p>POSITION AGAINST LIFTING SUDAN SANCTIONS BECAUSE THEY LACK </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT STILL SUPPORTS </p><p>TERRORISM. THE FOLLOWING NON-PAPER, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED </p><p>SECRET/RELEASABLE TO FRANCE, ARGENTINA, BANGLADESH, AND THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS, CONTAINS USG INFORMATION IMPLICATING KHARTOUM </p><p>IN CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. EMBASSIES ARE </p><p>REQUESTED TO SHARE THIS NON-PAPER WITH HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS AT AN APPROPRIATE SENIOR LEVEL IN AN ATTEMPT </p><p>TO PERSUADE THEM THAT UNSC SANCTIONS SHOULD NOT BE LIFTED </p><p>AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/RELEASABLE TO FRANCE, ARGENTINA, BANGLADESH, AND THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS ONLY - ENTIRE TEXT) BEGIN TEXT OF NON-PAPER: </p><p> </p><p>CURRENT STATUS OF SUDAN\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE OBSERVED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SUDAN\'S SUPPORT </p><p>FOR TERRORISM SINCE THE DECEMBER 1999 POLITICAL SHAKEUP IN </p><p>WHICH PRESIDENT OMAR AL-BASHIR CONSOLIDATED POWER AND </p><p>SIDELINED NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) LEADER HASSAN AL- </p><p>TURBAI. TERRORISTS FROM A VARIETY OF ISLAMIC EXTREMIST </p><p>GROUPS---SUCH AS USAMA BIN LADIN\'S ORGANIZATION, EGYPTIAN </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD (EIJ), AND HAMAS---CONTINUE TO USE SUDAN FOR </p><p>SAFEHAVEN, TRAINING, AND, IN SOME CASES, AS A PLATFORM TO </p><p>PLAN OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>USAMA BIN LADIN </p><p> </p><p>SUDAN\'S CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO HAVE HAD LITTLE </p><p>EFFECT ON BIN LADIN OPERATIVES, WHO CONTINUE TO OPERATE </p><p>FREELY FROM KHARTOUM. SEVERAL BIN LADIN BUSINESSES--- </p><p>INCLUDING ATYAF INVESTMENTS AND THE KHARTOUM TANNERYE---ARE </p><p>RUN BY AL-QA\'IDA LIEUTENANTS AND STILL OPERATE IN SUDAN, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE </p><p> </p><p>-- SUDAN MAINTAINS A FINANCIAL STAKE IN SOME OF THESE </p><p>COMPANIES AND HAS TRIED TO OBSCURE BIN LADIN\'S COMMERCIAL </p><p>TIES BY CHANGING THE NAME OF AT LEAST ONE OF HIS COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>EGYPTIAN GROUPS </p><p> </p><p>THE EIJ AND AL-GAMA\'AT AL-ISLAMIYYA ALSO RECEIVE SAFEHAVEN </p><p>AND SUPPORT IN SUDAN. MORE THAN 20 EIJ AND GAMA\'AT MEMBERS </p><p>AFFILIATED WITH BIN LADIN ARE OPERATING IN SUDAN AND MEET </p><p>ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DISCUSS COMMON ISSUES OF CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p>-- SENIOR GAMA\'AT LEADER RIFA\'I TAHA MUSA---WHO IS ALLIED </p><p>WITH BIN LADIN AND LST OCTOBER CALLED FOR AN INCREASE IN </p><p>ANTI-US ATTACKS---TRAVELED TO SUDAN IN APRIL TO RALLY LOCAL </p><p>GAMA\'AT SUPPORT FOR HIS PLAN TO RETURN THE GROUP TO VIOLENT </p><p>OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>PALESTINIAN GROUPS </p><p> </p><p>SEVERAL PALESTINIAN EXTREMIST GROUPS---SUCH AS HAMAS, THE </p><p>PALESTINE ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ) AND THE ABU NIDAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION (ANO)--MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN SUDAN AND </p><p>CONTINUE TO CONDUCT A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING </p><p>FUNDRAISING, RECRUITMENT, IDEOLOGICAL AND PARAMILITARY </p><p>TRAINING, AND OTHER LOGISTICAL SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- HAMAS--WHICH HAS A FEW HUNDRED SUPPORTERS AMONG THE </p><p>LOCAL PALESTINIAN POPULATION--HAS AN OFFICIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN KHARTOUM, OPERATES AT LEAST ONE SMALL </p><p>FRONT COMPANY, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL NGOS THERE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PIJ MAINTAINS A SMALLER PRESENCE THAN HAMAS IN </p><p>SUDAN BUT HAS AN OFFICE AND PERMANENT REPRESENTATION IN </p><p>KHARTOUM. ITS MEMBERSHIP IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF </p><p>UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, AND IT ALSO OPERATES SMALL COMMERCIAL </p><p>VENTURES. </p><p> </p><p>SOME INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN WARY </p><p>OF POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUDANESE POLICY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, </p><p>SUGGESTING THEY HAVE MADE PREPARATIONS TO LEAVE SUDAN. </p><p>OTHER SOURCES INDICATE, HOWEVER, THAT PIJ OPERATIVES </p><p>MAINTAIN CLOSE TIES TO THE SUDANESE REGIME DESPITE THE </p><p>CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRAN AND NGO\'S </p><p> </p><p>SUDAN ALSO PROVIDES A PLATFORM FOR IRAN TO MEET WITH </p><p>EXTREMIST GROUPS AND SUPPORTS VARIOUS NON-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTE TERRORIST ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAN COUNTS ON SUDAN\'S GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY AND BENIGN </p><p>OPERATING ENVIRONMENT TO ALLOW IRANIAN AGENTS TO MEET WITH </p><p>AND CHANNEL FUNDS, WEAPONS, AND TRAINING TO ISLAMIC </p><p>EXTREMISTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- KHARTOUM\'S WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE PROVIDING SAFEHAVEN </p><p>FOR VARIOUS RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS FACILITATES IRAN\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THEIR TERRORIST OPERATIONS AGAINST </p><p>ISRAEL AND TO IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>AFRICAN OPPOSITIONISTS </p><p> </p><p>BASHIR HAS TAKEN SOME INITIAL STEPS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS </p><p>WITH ERITREA AND ETHIOPIA SINCE TAKING OFFICE, BUT A </p><p>VARIETY OF REPORTS SUGGEST THAT SUDAN STILL AIDS OPPOSITION </p><p>GROUPS FROM THESE COUNTRIES AND OTHERS---INCLUDING SOMALIA </p><p>AND UGANDA. KHARTOUM PROVIDES THESE GROUPS WITH FUNDING, </p><p>ARMS, MILITARY ASSISTANCE, AND SAFEHAVEN. </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED PROSPECTS FOR CHANGE </p><p> </p><p>BASHIR WILL MOVE AGAINST SOME EXTREMIST GROUPS ONLY IF IT </p><p>SERVES SUDAN\'S BROADER ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INTERESTS AND </p><p>ASSISTS HIM IN HIS ONGOING BATTLE WITH TURABI\'S NIF </p><p>FACTION. PROGRESS WILL ONLY COME SLOWLY. WE CANNOT </p><p>CONFIRM THAT KHARTOUM HAS DEPORTED ANY TERRORIST GROUPS OR </p><p>INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. </p><p> </p><p>-- BASHIR\'S OUSTER OF THE POPULAR ARAB AND ISLAMIC </p><p>CONFERENCE (PAIC) IS AN EARLY INDICATOR THAT HE COULD PLACE </p><p>TRAVEL AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON SOME EXTREMISTS TO ISOLATE </p><p>TURABI FURTHER AND TO PLACATE THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, WHICH HAVE </p><p>CRITICIZED SUDAN\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-- BASHIR HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS--SUCH AS SIGNING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS TO COMBAT TERRORISM--IF ONLY TO </p><p>ATTRACT MORE WESTERN EUROPEAN AND MODERATE ARAB BUSINESSMEN </p><p>AND TO GAUGE THE RESIDUAL STRENGTH OF TURABI\'S SUPPORTERS. </p><p>BUT HE NONETHELESS HAS NOT TAKEN ACTION CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>THOSE CONVENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>(END TEXT OF NON-PAPER) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
