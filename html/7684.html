SUMMARY:  SECRETARY RUMSFELD\'S VISIT TO THE UAE AND OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, CIVILIAN DEATHS DUE TO AN ARMS DUMP </p><p>EXPLOSION IN BAGHDAD, AND ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATIONS IN IRAQ </p><p>DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA.  IN "AL BAYAN," UAE COLUMNIST </p><p>AYSHA SULTAN CRITICIZED ANY \'EXCUSES\' GIVEN FOR THE CRIMES </p><p>COMMITTED BY THE PREVIOUS IRAQI REGIME.  IN "AL ITTIHAD," UAE </p><p>COLUMNIST DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA CRITICIZED THE ATTITUDES OF A FEW </p><p>GULF COUNTRIES TOWARDS THE AMERICAN PRESENCE IN IRAQ.  EDITOR-IN- </p><p>CHIEF OF "AL BAYAN," KHALED MOHAMMED AHMED, COMMENTED ON THE MANY </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR AND ITS EFFECTS ON NOT ONLY IRAQ BUT THE </p><p>ENTIRE ARAB WORLD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DONALD RUMSFELD\'S VISIT TO THE GULF </p><p>STARTED WITH THE UAE AND WAS COVERED IN ALL ARABIC AND ENGLISH </p><p>NEWSPAPERS.  EXCERPTS OF SECRETARY RUMSFELD\'S ABU DHABI TV </p><p>INTERVIEW WERE ALSO CARRIED IN UAE DAILIES.  THE INTERVIEW WAS </p><p>BROADCAST IN ITS ENTIRETY DURING THE TWO-HOUR PROGRAM, "THE </p><p>TURNING POINT," ON ABU DHABI TV THE SAME NIGHT AND REBROADCAST </p><p>DURING MORNING NEWS PROGRAMMING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CRITICIZING ANY EXCUSES FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE </p><p>PREVIOUS IRAQI REGIME, UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN WROTE IN DUBAI- </p><p>BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" ON 4/28: </p><p> </p><p>"... HOW IS IT THAT SOME ARE STILL LOOKING FOR EXCUSES FOR THIS </p><p>REGIME, DESCRIBING IT AS PAN-ARABIST BECAUSE IT DID NOT ACQUIESCE </p><p>TO SIGNING ANY AGREEMENTS WITH ISRAEL AND IT OPPOSED THE U.S. AND </p><p>IT ... ?  HOW COULD EXCUSES BE GIVEN TO THE MASSACRES, THE </p><p>INJUSTICE, AND THE TYRANNY?  WHERE DID THE MILLIONS OF THE (MONEY </p><p>OF THE) IRAQI PEOPLE GO?  AND THE OIL BILLIONS?  WHY IS </p><p>EVERYTHING BEING GATHERED INTO BOXES AND BAGS BY THE AMERICANS, </p><p>AND TRANSFERRED TO UNKNOWN \'SECURE\' PLACES ABOUT WHICH ONLY THE </p><p>AMERICANS KNOW?  WHY WEREN\'T THEY USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF IRAQ?  FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRAQ?  FOR REBUILDING </p><p>IRAQ?  WHEN THE WATER PUMP INITIATED BY SHEIKH ZAYED BIN SULTAN </p><p>AL NAHYAN IN BASRA WAS READY WITHIN ONLY 36 HOURS, WHILE A WHOLE </p><p>REGIME WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THIS FOR 12 YEARS, LEAVING PEOPLE TO </p><p>DIE OF THIRST, THEN WHAT COULD BE SAID AFTERWARDS?  WHAT DEFENSE </p><p>COULD BE ACCEPTABLE OR EVEN FORGIVEN?" </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON THE DOUBLE STANDARDS OF ARAB LEADERS ON THE </p><p>U.S. PRESENCE IN IRAQ, DR. ANWAR GHARGHASH WROTE IN ABU DHABI- </p><p>BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" ON 4/28: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE REQUEST OF THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES FOR THE U.S. TO </p><p>SHORTEN ITS PRESENCE IN THE REGION SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY INNER </p><p>INITIATIVES TO DEAL WITH THESE NEW ASPECTS.  THESE INITIATIVES </p><p>SHOULD INCLUDE AN OPEN METHOD ASSERTING THE POLITICAL AND CIVIL </p><p>RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE.  THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD NOT REJECT THE U.S. </p><p>PRESENCE ON THE GROUNDS OF INDEPENDENCE, WHILE THEY DO NOT </p><p>RESPECT OTHER VALUES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR AN ARAB PERSON ... </p><p>AND WHOEVER IS ASKING WASHINGTON TO LEAVE IRAQ CAN\'T CONTINUE HIS </p><p>ABUSIVE TREATMENT OF HIS OWN PEOPLE ..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  URGING NO ONE TO BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. OCCUPATOPM OF IRAQ IS </p><p>TO ESTABLISH DEMOCRACY, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 4/27: </p><p> </p><p>"... MAYBE HISTORY, BOTH RECENT AND ANCIENT HISTORY, CONFIRMS </p><p>THAT THE U.S. IS AND WAS NEVER A COUNTRY THAT RESPECTS DEMOCRACY </p><p>AND THE DECISIONS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.  THROUGH ITS POLICY, THE </p><p>U.S. HAS BEEN GREATLY SUPPORTING TOTALITARIANISM AND </p><p>DICTATORSHIP.  ALL ITS (U.S.) WARS IN THE WORLD WERE AIMED AT </p><p>DEFEATING THE PEOPLE AND CONFISCATING THEIR LIBERTY IN ORDER TO </p><p>ATTAIN ITS BENEFITS AS A GREATER COUNTRY.  NOW THE U.S. IS </p><p>SEEKING TO ESTABLISH A NEW WORLD ORDER UNDER ITS OWN CONTROL TO </p><p>DOMINATE THE WORLD THROUGH POWER AND FORCE, NOT THROUGH LIBERTY </p><p>AND DEMOCRACY ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "BURGLARY IN IRAQ," "AL-BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 4/27: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW CONFIRMS THAT THE U.S. IS SEEKING </p><p>TOTAL HEGEMONY IN IRAQ, OR SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO ITS </p><p>ECONOMIC WEALTH.  IT (THE U.S.) HAS ALREADY CHOSEN TWO FINANCIAL </p><p>OFFICIALS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY IN ORDER TO CONTROL </p><p>THE ECONOMY OF IRAQ, AND THEY ARE \'PETER MCPHERSON\' AND \'GEORGE </p><p>WOOLF.\'  SO IT IS CLEAR WHO WILL BE SELLING IRAQI OIL AND WHO HAS </p><p>THE RIGHT FOR ITS DISPOSAL?!" </p><p> </p><p>7.  CRITICIZING THE ATTITUDES OF A FEW GULF COUNTRIES TOWARDS THE </p><p>AMERICAN PRESENCE IN IRAQ, DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA WROTE IN "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" ON 4/27: </p><p> </p><p>"... MAYBE WE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME STANCE AS ISLAMIC IRAN AND </p><p>NATIONALISTIC SYRIA HAVE, BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THEIR POINT OF </p><p>VIEW AND ACCEPT IT.  WHAT WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND IS THE STANCE OF </p><p>SOME OF THE GULF COUNTRIES TOWARDS THE U.S.  SOME OF THESE </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE STRONG CONNECTIONS WITH THE U.S. IN ADDITION TO </p><p>HAVING U.S. MILITARY BASES FOR OVER 30 YEARS ..." </p><p>8.  COMMENTING ON THE DILEMMA CONFRONTING THE ARAB WORLD </p><p>FOLLOWING THE WAR IN IRAQ, "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 4/26: </p><p> </p><p>"...THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ARABS ARE FACED WITH A REAL DILEMMA </p><p>BECAUSE OF AMERICAN CONTROL (OF THE REGION).  ONE OF ITS </p><p>COUNTRIES (ARAB COUNTRIES) FELL UNDER AMERICAN OCCUPATION, SO IT </p><p>IS FAR FROM THE TRUTH THAT WASHINGTON MIGHT REPLAY THIS </p><p>INEXPENSIVE GAME IN ORDER TO OCCUPY ANOTHER ARAB COUNTRY..." </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN A CLOSING STATEMENT, SALIM WROTE IN "AL-KHALEEJ" ON 4/26: </p><p> </p><p>"UNTIL NOW, THE U.S. HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVE THAT IRAQ HAS WMD </p><p>DURING THE ERA OF THE PREVIOUS REGIME, DESPITE THE FACT AND </p><p>DESPERATE INSPECTION EFFORTS CARRIED OUT BY U.S. TROOPS IN IRAQ. </p><p>WASHINGTON HAS TO PROVE THIS IN ORDER TO HAVE A MAJOR EXCUSE FOR </p><p>ITS ATTACK ON IRAQ, OTHERWISE, IT WILL LOSE ITS CREDIBILITY, </p><p>WHICH IT ALREADY LOST EVEN BEFORE ITS ATTACKS.  WHAT IF THE BUSH </p><p>ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES PROOF BUT DOES NOT SUCCEED IN FINDING THE </p><p>WMD?  NOTHING!  WHO WILL THEN PUNISH THE U.S.?" </p><p> </p><p>10.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR," EDITOR-IN- </p><p>CHIEF KHALED MOHAMMED AHMED WROTE IN A FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE IN "AL </p><p>BAYAN" ON 4/26: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE ARAB REGION WILL BE FACED WITH INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>THAT SWING BETWEEN TENSION AND APPEAL, BETWEEN ATTRACTION AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION, AND BETWEEN SHOCK AND AWE.  SO ARE THE ARABS READY </p><p>FOR THIS?  HAVE THEY BENEFITED FROM THE IRAQI LESSON, OR DO THEY </p><p>NEED MORE SHOCKS?  NOW, AND THROUGH BAGHDAD, PASSES THE ROADMAP. </p><p>WILL IT ALLOW THE PALESTINIANS TO REACH THE END OF THE ROAD, OR </p><p>IS THE PATH STILL LADEN WITH THORNS EVEN AFTER THE FALL OF </p><p>BAGHDAD?" </p><p> </p><p>11.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "FACING THE EARTHQUAKE AND ITS </p><p>AFTERSHOCKS," "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 4/25: </p><p> </p><p>"... THERE IS A NEED FOR AN ACCURATE, TRANSPARENT AND THOROUGH </p><p>LOOK AT REALITY ... IN ADDITION, WE NEED TO TAKE INTO </p><p>CONSIDERATION THIS NATION\'S POTENTIAL AND CAPABILITIES THAT COULD </p><p>BE EMPLOYED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  THIS IS ONLY IF ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES REALLY WANT TO DEVELOP IT THROUGH A COOPERATIVE ARAB </p><p>EFFORT TO THE LEVEL THAT MAKES THIS NATION PRODUCTIVE AND ABLE TO </p><p>GUIDE ITS OWN FUTURE ... WITHOUT THIS, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE </p><p>EARTHQUAKE WILL DESTROY WHAT IS LEFT." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
