<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000025 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, IO; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>USUN NEW YORK FOR POL:ETUNIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 01/03/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, CE, External Relations, UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  In meeting with MFA officials, Mission urges </p><p>an improvement in Sri Lanka\'s UN voting record </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) 02 USUN New York 3135 (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) USUN-Colombo class e-mail 12/17/02 </p><p>-      (C) USUN-Colombo class e-mail 11/23/02 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a January 6 meeting, DCM and Polchief met </p><p>with Sri Lankan MFA officials Rodney Perera, Director </p><p>(Americas), and W.A.T. Gunatilleke, Acting Director </p><p>(Middle East/Africa).  DCM noted that we had reviewed </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s voting record at the recent UNGA and were </p><p>disappointed that its delegation had not voted with the </p><p>U.S. more often.  To underscore this point, DCM provided </p><p>Perera a copy of Sri Lanka\'s voting record re First </p><p>Committee disarmament issues (see Ref C).  The record </p><p>indicated that the GSL had voted differently from the </p><p>U.S. on 13 of 14 occasions.  In addition, we understood </p><p>that Sri Lanka had not been particularly helpful on </p><p>Israeli practices issues (see Ref B).  We were also </p><p>disappointed that Sri Lanka\'s permrep (C. Mahendran) had </p><p>been quoted as making remarks harsh in tone toward the </p><p>U.S. at times. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Perera responded that many of Sri Lanka\'s votes </p><p>were decided by "Non-Aligned Movement" (NAM) countries </p><p>meeting as a bloc.  DCM said he understood that.  The </p><p>U.S. had excellent bilateral ties with the GSL, however, </p><p>and we wanted to cooperate as productively as possible </p><p>in multilateral settings, too.  We were willing to work </p><p>with the MFA in order to accomplish this. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  Mission will continue to work with the </p><p>GSL on this important matter.  Sri Lanka\'s current </p><p>government is basically very pro-U.S. (witness its </p><p>signing of an ICC Article 98 bilateral agreement in </p><p>November).  It is unfortunate that this general </p><p>orientation has not affected the GSL\'s UN voting record </p><p>in any substantive way.  We think a big part of the </p><p>problem is the MFA, which seems -- as it has for </p><p>years -- to buy off on NAM, G-77 ways of thinking.  In </p><p>addition, Permrep Mahendran has not proven as receptive </p><p>to U.S. views as we would like.  We plan to review this </p><p>matter with political-level officials, such as key </p><p>ministers Milinda Moragoda and G.L. Peiris, once they </p><p>return from the fourth round of talks with the Tamil </p><p>Tigers in Thailand.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
