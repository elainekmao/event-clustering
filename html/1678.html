<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000993 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECLASS ON 4/25/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, MOPS, PINS, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO REPLACES SERVICE CHIEFS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Refs: (A) USDAO Abuja 874 (B) USDAO Abuja 877 </p><p>-     (C) USDAO Lagos  (D) OFR Difficulties Cable </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  President Obasanjo on April 24 abruptly retired </p><p>Chief of Army Staff LTG Victor Malu, Chief of Naval Staff </p><p>VADM V.K. Ombu and Chief of Air Staff, AVM Isaac Alfa.  MG </p><p>A.O. Ogomudia will replace Malu, and RADM S.I. Afolayan and </p><p>AVM J.D. Wuyep will replace, respectively, Ombu and Alfa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Reftels provide background on the reasons for the </p><p>dismissals, as well as biographic information.  The GON is </p><p>offering different reasons for the changes to different </p><p>audiences.  The first public message was that the three men </p><p>voluntarily and simultaneously retired.  The second public </p><p>message was that President Obasanjo had always planned a </p><p>"mid-term" change of Service Chiefs (the traditional term </p><p>of office has been four years; Malu, Ombu and Alfa became </p><p>Service Chiefs shortly after Obasanjo took office in May </p><p>1999).  Indeed, there was talk of changes in January. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The private message to diplomats focuses on </p><p>Administration unhappiness with Malu\'s public opposition to </p><p>its policies and suggests that Ombu and Alfa lost their </p><p>jobs simultaneously largely in order to make Malu\'s forced </p><p>retirement look somehow routine.  Clearly, none of the </p><p>affected Service Chiefs was expecting the ax to fall when </p><p>it did.  Toeing the public line in a phone call to the </p><p>Ambassador, LTC M.I. Idris, military assistant to NSA Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed, said the retirements were "normal" and that no </p><p>"backlash" was expected from the Nigerian military.  He </p><p>said that the decision to remove Malu was unrelated to the </p><p>former COAS\'s well-publicized complaints about Operation </p><p>Focus Relief.  Idris admitted, however, that Malu\'s recent </p><p>statements to the press (ref D) had influenced the timing </p><p>of the dismissals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  However, Idris also told the Ambassador that Malu </p><p>and his colleagues had created "other problems" of which </p><p>the USG had not been made aware.  Reporting in other </p><p>channels tends to confirm that Alfa and Ombu had their own </p><p>problems with senior Administration civilians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Reaction to the forced retirements has been mixed. </p><p>For many, the key question is whether the previous regional </p><p>and ethnic balance was maintained.  In that sense, there </p><p>has been a marked shift toward the Southwest.  The Chief of </p><p>Army Staff (COAS) position, by far the most important, has </p><p>slipped from Northern hands for the first time in over 20 </p><p>years, going to an officer (Ogomudia) who is from Southern </p><p>Edo State, an area with kinship ties to the Yoruba. </p><p>Officially, however, Edo is part of the South-South </p><p>"geopolitical" region, so Ogomudia\'s elevation gives this </p><p>region a replacement for Ombu, who we believe may be from a </p><p>northern Bayelsa State minority with kinship ties to the </p><p>Igbo.  News media report that Afolayan is from the North- </p><p>Central region.  His name has a Yoruba ring to it, so we </p><p>think he is probably from Kwara State.  Wuyep is a </p><p>Christian from Plateau State.  His elevation is a more-or- </p><p>less even trade for the removal of Alfa, who is from </p><p>Plateau State, also in the North-Central region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Thus, the Obasanjo Administration has formally </p><p>maintained the existing regional balance:  Two Chiefs from </p><p>the North-Central region (Wuyep and Afolayan) and one from </p><p>the South-South (Ogomudia).  However, two of the new Chiefs </p><p>will be assumed (at least in the North) to be allied with </p><p>Yoruba interests, where before none was seen as ethnically </p><p>close to the Yoruba.  Moreover, one of those two Chiefs is </p><p>the one who really matters -- the COAS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Northerners, predictably, have reacted negatively </p><p>to the loss of what has traditionally been the top military </p><p>job.  Northern Senators claimed in press interviews the day </p><p>the retirements were announced that the move was a </p><p>"vendetta" against the North, and could be potentially </p><p>destabilizing--a code work that it violated what the North </p><p>views as the proper "zoning" of the position.  They also </p><p>alluded to the possibility that the change was instigated </p><p>by the U.S., whose participation in Nigerian military </p><p>matters Malu opposed.  While this rhetoric is somewhat </p><p>hyperbolic, it does reflect anger in the North that two </p><p>years into a democratic administration it has lost the </p><p>position from which it ruled the country for the better </p><p>part of the past twenty years.  Some Northern members of </p><p>the House of Representatives have indicated plans to </p><p>convoke Defense Minister Danjuma to explain the dismissals, </p><p>as well as the  resence of American troops, ho they </p><p>claimed to have been in Nigeria for over six months. </p><p>(Note: All troops left before the end of 2000.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) It is also believed in some circles that Malu\'s </p><p>removal may have been precipitated in part because of his </p><p>growing popularity with vocal Northern critics of the GON. </p><p>Malu\'s complaints about U.S.-Nigerian mil-mil relations had </p><p>struck a resonant chord in certain Northern circles where </p><p>the memories of the Abacha years are not unpleasant.  Malu </p><p>had made a point to assert the moral correctness of his </p><p>service under and loyalty to the Abacha regime when he </p><p>appeared before the Oputa Panel.  Some observers believe </p><p>that Malu\'s increasing popularity in the North may have </p><p>emboldened him to take actions that bordered on (perhaps </p><p>even crossed the line into) insubordination, forcing the </p><p>President to remove him.  Regardless of the role this may </p><p>have played in the decision to remove Malu, his replacement </p><p>with a Southerner (viewed by many Northerners as Yoruba) </p><p>does appear intended to send a message to Northern elites, </p><p>particularly those advocating for Ibrahim Babangida to run </p><p>for the Presidency in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  Comment:  We had anticipated that Nigerian news </p><p>media, always eager to see a foreign conspiracy in the </p><p>national closet, would have quickly picked up on the </p><p>Northern senators\' hints that the U.S. instigated the </p><p>Chiefs\' removals.  We had a categorical denial ready for </p><p>use when the need arose.  While a few articles have implicitly </p><p>alluded to this theory, no allegation has been so blatant that </p><p>we have had to issue a denial on something that is probably </p><p>a domestic, Nigerian move.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
