<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002674 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: OVIP, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: SUBJECT: CODEL DASCHLE CODEL: TOWARD A BETTER </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THE APPLICATION OF SHARI\'A IN NIGERIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2506 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; ReasonS 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On August 31, Codel Daschle met attorney </p><p>Hauwa Ibrahim (strictly protect) for a brief on the Amina </p><p>Lawal case (reftel) and to receive a general primer on the </p><p>legal and constitutional issues arising from the application </p><p>of criminal Shari\'a in twelve Northern Nigerian states. </p><p>Ibrahim stressed that her efforts were not to undermine </p><p>Shari\'a but to make sure Shari\'a was correctly interpreted </p><p>and applied and that the decisions of the Shari\'a courts </p><p>complied with constitutional guarantees of due process and </p><p>against cruel punishment. Ibrahim explained the political </p><p>minefield that Shari\'a has become at all levels of </p><p>government, exposing why each branch hopes the other will </p><p>render the difficult decisions.  Ibrahim also confided that </p><p>she feared for her safety because of the high profile stance </p><p>she has taken, but stated that she would soldier on in her </p><p>legal campaign. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On August 31, Hauwa Ibrahim updated Codel Daschle on </p><p>the Amina Lawal case and other relevant Shari\'a issues. </p><p>Ibrahim was accompanied by Dr. Kole Shettima, an Islamic </p><p>scholar. Ms. Ibrahim summarized for Senators Daschle, </p><p>Nighthorse Campbell, Reid and Bingaman her four-pronged </p><p>defense of Lawal, which she described as based on the facts </p><p>of the case, constitutional law, criminal procedure, and </p><p>proper interpretation of Shari\'a (reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ibrahim stressed her desire to see Shari\'a Law applied </p><p>properly in Shari\'a States. Emphasizing the need for those </p><p>accused under the new Shari\'a laws to have legal counsel, she </p><p>believed the defendants who have attorneys were being treated </p><p>much better than those who did not.    She told the Senators </p><p>about eleven minors whose theft convictions carry the </p><p>sentence of hand amputation (none of which has been carried </p><p>out).  Working pro bono, Ibrahim stated that she only had the </p><p>resources to defend four of the eleven cases. These four have </p><p>been acquitted, but the other, attorney-less seven are still </p><p>incarcerated awaiting the outcome of their cases. Ibrahim </p><p>also informed the Senators that she had been able to quickly </p><p>settle several other adultery cases against women, with the </p><p>defendants either being acquitted or paying minimal fines. </p><p>She said she was following the progress of three other </p><p>adultery cases which had recently been reported in the media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ibrahim explained the difficulties faced in defending </p><p>cases in some of the Shari\'a jurisdictions. Criminal </p><p>procedure and legal codes are different in each of the 12 </p><p>Shari\'a States.  Some, such as Kaduna and Sokoto, have both </p><p>criminal and procedural codes, while others, such as Katsina </p><p>State, only have the criminal code. Responding to a question </p><p>from the Senators about the role of the federal government, </p><p>Ibrahim stated that the GON could do little at this point. </p><p>While the Attorney General has publicly criticized harsh </p><p>Shari\'a punishments, the constitution did not empower him to </p><p>seek an advisory opinion in federal court, against the </p><p>constitutionality of Shari\'a punishments.  Moreover, the GON </p><p>cannot prohibit states from enacting Shari\'a laws.  Shari\'a </p><p>is recognized in the Federal constitution and enacting </p><p>Shari\'a is well within the ken of State\'s rights and powers. </p><p>Right now the only thing the GON could do is watch as cases </p><p>wound their way through the court system.  For instance, the </p><p>Lawal case was now before the highest Shari\'a Court in </p><p>Katsina State.  Should that court uphold the conviction, </p><p>Ibrahim was committed to seeking relief at the Federal Court </p><p>of Appeals. At that juncture, the Ministry of Justice could </p><p>perhaps enter the case.  Ibrahim believed that neither the </p><p>Obasanjo Government nor most Northern governors supported </p><p>these harsh penalties, but none would publicly condemn the </p><p>punishments, fearing a political backlash in the North for </p><p>being seen as anti-Shari\'a.  (Comment: Ibrahim correctly </p><p>pointed out the political quandary faced by the Northern </p><p>governors as well as President Obasanjo.  A born-again </p><p>Baptist Christian, Obasanjo has made his opposition to what </p><p>he calls "political Shari\'a" known.  Any move that Obasanjo </p><p>would make would be seen, not as an attempt to spare a life </p><p>or protect the constitution, but as confirmation that he was </p><p>anti-Islamic and anti-North.  It would spark strong reaction </p><p>in many quarters.  Consequently, the President would like to </p><p>avoid seeing a petition to commute a Shari\'a sentence reach </p><p>his desk.  It would be better for him and for political </p><p>tranquility if the issue of cruel and unusual punishment were </p><p>conclusively decided by the courts. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Throughout the meeting Ibrahim returned to the theme </p><p>of standing up for the legal rights of the most vulnerable in </p><p>society.  However, she chafed at being portrayed in the print </p><p>media, which is mainly based in the Christian South, as </p><p>anti-Shari\'a.  She denied this claim stating she is pro-due </p><p>process and that such labels put her in personal danger and </p><p>further complicated the task of representing Amina Lawal and </p><p>others. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The meeting with Ibrahim again underscored the </p><p>inchoate development of Shari\'a jurisprudence in Nigeria. </p><p>The criminal Shari\'a system is new and fraught with </p><p>uncertainties.  Aspects of the substantive criminal code do </p><p>not match with procedural codes in those states which have </p><p>both codes.  Many local judges only have a superficial, </p><p>mechanistic approach to application of Shari\'a law, missing </p><p>the important tenets of tolerance and equity that are major </p><p>aspects of Islamic jurisprudence.  The relationship of </p><p>Shari\'a to the federal constitution must also be defined. </p><p>Muslim human rights activists and attorneys like Ibrahim, </p><p>must be at the forefront of attempts to reconcile the </p><p>application of Shari\'a in Nigeria with internationally </p><p>recognized precepts of fundamental human rights.  We should </p><p>support them in carrying out this task. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
