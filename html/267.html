<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 102760 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:        PINR, PGOV, PINS, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:    LETTERS TO DEPARTMENT FROM LTTE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  FOUR DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS HAVE RECEIVED </p><p>LETTERS FROM THE LTTE, CRITICIZING THE PLACEMENT OF THE </p><p>TAMIL GROUP IN A US GOVERNMENT PUBLICATION ON TERRORIST </p><p>ORGZANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD AND CALLING FOR AMERICAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN MEDIATING THE CONFLICT IN SRI LANKA.  THE </p><p>LTTE APPEARS TO BE TAKING ISSUE WITH A DEFENSE DEPARTMENT </p><p>PUBLICATION ISSUED A FEW MONTHS AGO.  ACTION IS REQUESTED </p><p>IN PARAGRAPH 5, AND LETTER\'S TEXT IS PROVIDED IN </p><p>PARAGRAPH 6.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (LOU) NEA ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY PAUL HARE, </p><p>OUTGOING INR ASSISTANT SECRETARY ABRAMOWITZ, INR DIRECTOR </p><p>OF ANALYSIS FOR NEAR EAST AND SOUTH ASIA GEORGE HARRIS, </p><p>AND FORMER S/CT HEAD L. PAUL BREMER EACH RECEIVED </p><p>IDENTICAL LETTERS LAST WEEK ALLEGEDLY FROM THE LIBERATION </p><p>TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE).  THE LETTERS APPEAR TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN WRITTEN ON A COMPUTER WITH ONLY THE ADDRESSEES </p><p>ALTERED ON EACH, DATED MARCH 11, AND WERE MAILED FROM </p><p>CANADA.  WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUPPOSED AUTHOR </p><p>OF THE LETTER, "S. NATHAN", WHO IS </p><p>IDENTIFIED ONLY AS "FOR POLITICAL COMMITTEE". </p><p>NONETHELESS, WE HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT THE LETTERS\' </p><p>AUTHENTICITY, WHICH WERE WRITTEN IN ENGLISH ON TAMIL AND </p><p>ENGLISH LTTE LETTERHEAD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE LETTER PROTESTS THE INCLUSION OF THE LTTE IN </p><p>A US GOVERNMENT PUBLICATION "TERRORIST GROUP PROFILES." </p><p>PRESUMABLY, THE LTTE LETTER IS REFERRING TO THE DEFENSE </p><p>DEPARTMENT REPORT ON GROUPS INVOLVED IN TERRORISM ISSUED </p><p>RECENTLY, WHICH DESCRIBES THE LTTE, ALONG WITH SOME FIFTY </p><p>OTHER GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THE LETTER ALSO </p><p>REQUESTS U.S. MEDIATION ON BEHALF OF SRI LANKA\'S TAMILS, </p><p>AND STATES THE WILLINGNESS OF THE LTTE TO MEET WITH </p><p>AMERICAN DIPLOMATS.  WHILE THE LTTE DENIES THAT IT IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRORIST CRIMES AND ALLEGES THAT IT IS </p><p>THE VICTIM OF SRI LANKAN AND INDIAN PROPAGANDA, THE TONE </p><p>OF THE LETTER IS NEITHER THREATENING NOR INTIMIDATING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY OF SRI LANKA WATCHERS IN </p><p>WASHINGTON REVEALS THAT THESE FOUR LETTERS ARE THE ONLY </p><p>ONES RECEIVED SO FAR.  WHILE THE LTTE WAS SAVVY ENOUGH TO </p><p>DIRECT ITS APPEAL TO THE APPROPRIATE SENIOR OFFICERS IN </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT, TO DATE NO LETTER HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY </p><p>THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, WHICH AUTHORED THE REPORT.  MORE </p><p>LTTE CORRESPONDENCE MAY SOON BE RECEIVED, HOWEVER, SINCE </p><p>THE LETTERS HAVE NOT ARRIVED ALL AT ONCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ACTION REQUESTED:  WE WOULD APPRECIATE WORD FROM </p><p>ADDRESSEES REGARDING ANY CORRESPONDENCE OR COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>FROM THE LTTE REGARDING THE REPORT.  WE WOULD APPRECIATE </p><p>ANY INFORMATION ON ANY LTTE REQUESTS FOR AMERICAN </p><p>MEDIATION EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE TAMILS.  WE WOULD ALSO </p><p>WELCOME ANY INFORMATION OTTAWA MAY HAVE REGARDING THE </p><p>EXILE ACTIVITIES OF TAMIL GROUPS, AND OF THE SIGNATORY OF </p><p>THE LETTER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (LOU) TEXT OF LETTER.  BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>SIR, </p><p> </p><p>RE: TERRORIST GROUP PROFILES </p><p> </p><p>WE WISH TO CONTRADICT STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE ABOVE </p><p>PUBLICATION RELATING TO OUR ORGANIZATION, "THE LIBERATION </p><p>TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM". </p><p> </p><p>IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE ARE NOT A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. </p><p>WE ARE A MOVEMENT WHICH SEEKS THE RIGHT OF </p><p>SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE TAMILS OF SRI LANKA, THE SAME </p><p>RIGHT WHICH PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON OF YOUR COUNTRY </p><p>PROPOUNDED AFTER WORLD WAR I.  PLEASE THERFORE VIEW US AS </p><p>AN ORGANIZATION SIMILAR TO THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS </p><p>AND THE ALL-INDIA MUSLIM LEAGUE AS WELL AS THE MOVEMENT </p><p>LED BY THE FATHER OF BANGLADESH, THE LATE SHEIKH MUJIBUR </p><p>RAHMAN. </p><p> </p><p>SECONDLY, WE ARE AN ORGANIZATION WHICH ENDEAVOURS TO </p><p>PROTECT THE TAMILS FROM THE GENOCIDAL ATTACKS OF THE SRI </p><p>LANKAN STATE ON THE ONE HAND AND THE BRUTAL </p><p>HEAVY-HANDEDNESS OF THE INDIAN PEACE KEEPING FORCE ON THE </p><p>OTHER.  IN FACT, INDIAN \'PEACEKEEPERS\' HAVE BEEN INDICTED </p><p>UNDER THE INDIAN PENAL CODE FOR CRIMES SUCH AS RAPE, </p><p>LOOTING AND KILLING OF OUR INNOCENT TAMIL CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>THIRDLY, WE LIKE TO INVITE YOUR ATTENTION TO A STATEMENT </p><p>MADE BY MR. ROBERT PECK (ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR </p><p>SOUTH ASIA) THAT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY THE SRI </p><p>LANKA STATE AND TAMIL MILITANT GROUPS ARE TAKEN INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT, THE SRI LANKA STATE HAS COMMITTED GREATER </p><p>VIOLATIONS THAN ALL THE TAMIL MILITANT GROUPS PUT </p><p>TOGETHER DID. </p><p> </p><p>FOURTHLY, WE HAVE ALWAYS STATED THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO </p><p>DISCUSS OUR GRIEVANCES WHICH WERE NOT ADDRESSED BY THE </p><p>SRI LANKA AND INDIAN GOVERNMENTS - DISCRIMINATION AGAINST </p><p>TAMILS IN RECRUITMENT TO PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT, </p><p>DISCRIMINATION IN ADMISSION TO UNIVERSITIES AND THE </p><p>SYSTEMATIC COLONIZATION OF OUR TRADITIONAL HOMELANDS, </p><p>SIMILAR, WE ASSERT, TO WHAT PRESIDENT CEAUSESCU IS DOING </p><p>TO THE HUNGARIAN MINORITY IN TRANSYLVANIA. </p><p> </p><p>LASTLY, WE WISH TO CATEGORICALLY STATE THAT WE WOULD </p><p>WELCOME THE MEDIATION OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ON </p><p>BEHALF OF THE TAMIL PEOPLE OF SRI LANKA.  WE NEED YOUR </p><p>ASSISTANCE AS AN IMPARTIAL INTERMEDIARY, FOR THE </p><p>REHABILITATION OF OUR PEOPLE AND FOR PROVIDING RELIEF OF </p><p>OUR DISTRESSED PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>FINALLY, WE CATEGORICALLY DENY WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>CRIMES LISTED IN YOUR PUBLICATION.  WE HAVE BEEN THE </p><p>UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS OF THE STATE PROPAGANDA MACHINES OF </p><p>THE SRI LANKAN AND INDIAN GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>WE WOULD BE PLEASED TO BE INVITED FOR TALKS BY YOUR </p><p>GOVERNMENT TOWARD THE RESOLUTION OF THIS CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YOURS TRULY, </p><p> </p><p>S. NATHAN (FOR POLITICAL COMMITTEE) </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
