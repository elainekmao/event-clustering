<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000858 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: POWELL SPEECH FAILS TO SWAY JORDANIANS\' MINDS ON </p><p>IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR DOUGLAS SILLIMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p> AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> ------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A quick sampling of Jordanian reaction to Secretary </p><p>Powell,s February 5 </p><p>presentation to the UNSC -- including from the Prime Minister </p><p>-- indicates that </p><p>it changed few peoples\' minds on the issues of Iraq,s </p><p>failure to comply with </p><p>Resolution 1441, presence of WMD programs, or ties to </p><p>Al-Qaeda.  Many viewed </p><p>the speech as a "declaration of war" against Iraq that </p><p>demonstrated </p><p>-- regardless of Iraq,s efforts to comply with Resolution </p><p>1441 -- the U.S.\'s </p><p>determination to go to war.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>SECRETARY\'S EVIDENCE MALIGNED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Many of our contacts told us they believed the </p><p>evidence presented by </p><p>Secretary Powell was "mere fabrication."  Oraib Rantawi, with </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the Al-Quds </p><p>Political Research Center, wondered about the authenticity of </p><p>the photos </p><p>presented.  Faleh Taweel, former Jordanian Ambassador to </p><p>Iraq, said that the </p><p>intercepts of conversations of Iraqi officials were not </p><p>authentic:  Iraqi </p><p>officials would never speak to higher officials as they had </p><p>on tape, he </p><p>claimed.  Many described the evidence as "computer animation" </p><p>and </p><p>"Hollywoodized" evidence. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>JORDANIANS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  That many Jordanians, minds were not changed by </p><p>Secretary Powell,s </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>speech does not mean they favor Saddam.  Most agreed that </p><p>Saddam,s removal </p><p>would be a positive for the region as a whole and in the long </p><p>term for Jordan </p><p>as well.  However, the overall consensus was that war should </p><p>be avoided at all </p><p>costs.  Osama Malkawi, an attorney and ex parliamentarian, </p><p>commented that a war </p><p>against Iraq will be humiliating to the Arab world, </p><p>particularly considering </p><p>that the U.S. applies a "double standard" when enforcing UN </p><p>resolutions on Iraq </p><p>and Israel.   Malkawi wished the United States would devote </p><p>the same effort and </p><p>intensity to solving the Palestinian problem as it has the </p><p>Iraq issue. </p><p>Further, Malkawi ventured to say how differently the United </p><p>States has dealt </p><p>with North Korea on the similar issue of WMD. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>PM PRAISES SECRETARY, BUT IS STILL SKEPTICAL </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb told the Ambassador </p><p>and PolCouns </p><p>February 6 that the Secretary\'s presentation "shows that </p><p>there are some doubts" </p><p>about Iraq\'s cooperation with UN inspectors and WMD programs, </p><p>but provided "no </p><p>solid proof."  He commented that the Secretary "has major </p><p>credibility" in the </p><p>Arab world and had given "a good performance," but "didn\'t </p><p>show strong facts." </p><p>He concluded that UN inspectors should be given more time to </p><p>do their job, </p><p>commenting that, according to a CNN report he had seen "most </p><p>of the members of </p><p>the Security Council" seem to agree with that assessment. </p><p>The Ambassador </p><p>pushed back, outlining ref points on the Secretary\'s </p><p>presentation and its </p><p>evidence of lack of Iraqi cooperation, proof of Iraq\'s </p><p>possession of CBW, and </p><p>the regime\'s links to Al-Qaeda. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Many of post,s Jordanian contacts felt that the </p><p>Secretary\'s speech was geared </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>more towards the American audience than to the outside world. </p><p> They viewed his </p><p>speech as an attempt to consolidate American public opinion </p><p>and increase </p><p>support for the war.  As for  swaying Arab public opinion, </p><p>the consensus </p><p>view here is that the Secretary\'s speech had only a limited </p><p>impact in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
