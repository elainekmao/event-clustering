<p>UNCLAS ROME 005470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA WINNICK, L/UNA FOR ARBOGAST, USDA/FAS </p><p>FOR R. HUGHES </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, RQ, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT:  PUERTO RICO\'S ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP WITH FAO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION </p><p>(FAO) HAS INFORMED FODAG THAT PUERTO RICO SEEKS TO REGAIN </p><p>ASSOCIATE MEMBER STATUS WITH THE FAO (THIS STATUS HAVING </p><p>LAPSED DUE TO PUERTO RICO\'S INABILITY TO MEET ITS </p><p>FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.)  ACCORDING TO THE FAO STATUTES, </p><p>ASSOCIATE MEMBER STATUS MUST BE REQUESTED BY THE MEMBER </p><p>NATION RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TERRITORY\'S INTERNATIONAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05470  100908Z </p><p>RELATIONS.  THE MEMBER NATION ALSO UNDERTAKES TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT THE ASSOCIATE MEMBER COMPLIES WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS </p><p>(INCLUDING FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS).  THIS CABLE PROVIDES </p><p>BACKGROUND ON PUERTO RICO\'S ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FAO CONSTITUTION (ARTICLE II.11) ALLOWS FOR </p><p>ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP FOR TERRITORIES THAT ARE NOT </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THEIR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELATIONS.  THE MEMBER NATION HAVING AUTHORITY FOR THE </p><p>TERRITORY\'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS APPLIES ON THE </p><p>TERRITORY\'S BEHALF AND ASSUMES CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS (THE </p><p>MOST IMPORTANT BEING ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING </p><p>THAT THE ASSOCIATE MEMBER FULFILLS ITS FINANCIAL </p><p>OBLIGATIONS.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE UNITED STATES (JOHN BOLTON, ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION AFFAIRS) APPLIED </p><p>ON BEHALF OF PUERTO RICO OCTOBER 9, 1991 AND ACCEPTED THE </p><p>OBLIGATIONS OF FAO\'S CONSTITUTION ON PUERTO RICO\'S </p><p>BEHALF. IN 1993 PUERTO RICO REPORTED TO THE FAO THAT IT </p><p>COULD NOT MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND THAT IT </p><p>WISHED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE FAO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SINCE MEMBERS (INCLUDING ASSOCIATE MEMBERS) MUST WAIT </p><p>FOUR YEARS AFTER JOINING TO WITHDRAW, AND SINCE THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL COULD ONLY BE MADE BY THE UNITED STATES (ON </p><p>PUERTO RICO\'S BEHALF), PUERTO RICO DID NOT EFFECTIVELY </p><p>GIVE NOTICE TO WITHDRAW UNTIL DECEMBER 20, 1995.  AS THE </p><p>FAO CONSTITUTION STIPULATES THAT WITHDRAWAL TAKES EFFECT </p><p>ONE YEAR AFTER NOTICE HAS BEEN GIVEN (WITH FINANCIAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05470  100908Z </p><p>OBLIGATIONS CONTINUING UP TO THAT TIME), PUERTO RICO OWED </p><p>USD 75,424.80 IN ARREARS BY THE TIME ITS WITHDRAWAL </p><p>BECAME EFFECTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  CONCERNING THE U.S. OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT THE </p><p>ASSOCIATE MEMBER MEETS ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, THE </p><p>1995 U.S. WITHDRAWAL NOTICE (FROM THE ACTING ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>GEORGE WARD) STATED THAT THE U.S. WAS "INFORMED" OF THE </p><p>OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS AND THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD </p><p>"CONVEYED THIS INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PUERTO </p><p>RICO WHICH HAS CONFIRMED THAT IT ACCEPTS THE OBLIGATIONS </p><p>AND INTENDS TO MAKE PAYMENT BEFORE DECEMBER 31, 1996." </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF PUERTO RICO HAS WRITTEN TO </p><p>THE FAO REQUESTING TO BE RE-ADMITTED AS AN ASSOCIATE </p><p>MEMBER.  THE FAO HAS RESPONDED THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE </p><p>HANDLED BY THE MEMBER NATION (THE U.S.).  IN THIS </p><p>CONTEXT, PUERTO RICO HAS BEEN ADVISED AGAIN OF ITS </p><p>OUTSTANDING ARREARS WHICH WOULD NEED TO BE PAID OFF </p><p>BEFORE BECOMING A MEMBER AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  1991 AND 1995 LETTER OF ACCESSION AND WITHDRAWAL AND </p><p>OTHER SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION HAVE BEEN FAXED TO IO/EDA </p><p>AND USDA/FAS.  FYI, THERE ARE NO OTHER ASSOCIATE MEMBERS </p><p>AT THE FAO. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR BACKGROUND </p><p>ONLY, SINCE, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, PUERTO RICO HAS NOT </p><p>APPROACHED THE SECRETARY OF STATE REQUESTING THAT THE </p><p>UNITED STATES APPLY FOR ASSOCIATE MEMBER STATUS FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05470  100908Z </p><p>PUERTO RICO WITH THE FAO.
