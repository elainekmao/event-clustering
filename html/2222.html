<p>UNCLAS HARARE 003530 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX, ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR SCHLACHTER, AF/P, </p><p>INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT-OWNED RADIO ABOLISHES CALL-IN CURRENT </p><p>EVENTS PROGRAMMING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   THE STATE-OWNED ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION </p><p>    (ZBC) HAS CONVERTED ONE OF ITS FOUR RADIO STATIONS INTO AN </p><p>    18-HOUR PER DAY SPORTS CHANNEL.  THE NEW CHANNEL, NAMED </p><p>    "SPORTS FM," OCCUPIES THE FREQUENCY FORMERLY USED BY RADIO </p><p>    1.  RADIO 1 WAS AN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE STATION OFFERING MUSIC, </p><p>    NEWS AND CALL-IN DISCUSSION PROGRAMS THAT FOCUSED ON </p><p>    CURRENT AFFAIRS.  THE CONVERSION OF RADIO 1 TO "SPORTS FM" </p><p>    EFFECTIVELY ENDS ALL ADULT-ORIENTED CALL-IN RADIO </p><p>    PROGRAMMING IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>2.   RADIO 1 WAS THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE RHODESIAN </p><p>    BROADCASTING SERVICE.  ITS ALL-ENGLISH FORMAT AND MUSIC </p><p>    PLAY LIST CATERED TO ZIMBABWEANS OF EUROPEAN ANCESTRY. </p><p>    CONSEQUENTLY, RADIO 1 HAD THE SMALLEST AUDIENCE AND WAS THE </p><p>    LEAST PROFITABLE OF ANY OF THE ZBC\'S FOUR RADIO STATIONS. </p><p>    THE STATION DID, HOWEVER, HAVE A STRONG FOLLOWING AMONG A </p><p>    WIDE VARIETY OF ZIMBABWEANS FOR ITS EVENING CALL-IN CURRENT </p><p>    EVENTS PROGRAMS.  THESE PROGRAMS OFFERED CITIZENS AN </p><p>    OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND ASK PANELISTS </p><p>    QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPORTANT ISSUES.  CALLERS FREQUENTLY </p><p>    VOICED SHARP CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT OR RULING PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>3.   OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS, THESE PROGRAMS HAVE GRADUALLY </p><p>    BEEN CANCELLED, REDUCED TO PANEL DISCUSSIONS WITHOUT CALLS </p><p>    FROM THE AUDIENCE, OR RE-DIRECTED TO FOCUS ON NON-POLITICAL </p><p>    TOPICS.  ZBC HAS NEVER OFFERED REASONS FOR THESE PROGRAM </p><p>    CHANGES, BUT THE POPULAR PERCEPTION IS THAT ZBC MANAGEMENT </p><p>    AND THEIR POLITICAL BOSSES WERE UNHAPPY ABOUT PROVIDING A </p><p>    FORUM FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>    GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDING TO ONE CONTACT AT ZBC, THE </p><p>    "AUTHORITIES" HAD BECOME "VERY UNCOMFORTABLE" WITH PUBLIC </p><p>    COMPLAINTS ON THE CALL-IN PROGRAMS ABOUT THE "DEEPENING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03530  260645Z </p><p>    ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CRISIS UNDER PRESIDENT ROBERT </p><p>    MUGABE."  BY CONVERTING THE STATION TO AN ALL-SPORTS </p><p>    FORMAT, THE ZBC NEATLY USES A DEFENSIBLE BUSINESS DECISION </p><p>    TO GIVE ITSELF A POLITICAL "COMFORT ZONE." </p><p> </p><p>4.   IN ADDITION TO REMOVING GENUINE DISCUSSION PROGRAMS </p><p>    FROM ZIMBABWEAN AIRWAVES, THE CONVERSION OF THE STATION TO </p><p>    ALL SPORTS HAS ALSO DEALT A BLOW TO PLACEMENT OF VOA </p><p>    PROGRAMMING.  OF THE FOUR ZBC RADIO STATIONS, RADIO 1 HAS </p><p>    BEEN THE BIGGEST USER OF VOA NEWS, CURRENT AFFAIRS AND </p><p>    MUSIC PROGRAMS.  HOWEVER, VOA PROGRAMMING WILL CONTINUE ON </p><p>    RADIOS 3 AND 4. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
