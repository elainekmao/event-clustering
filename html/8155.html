<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002933 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ELECTION REGISTRATION OPENS; 622 CANDIDATES APPLY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 2682 B. AMMAN 2559-02 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Registration for candidates wishing to run in the June </p><p>17 elections officially began on May 18.  Candidates have </p><p>three days to register; afterwards, the GOJ has 4 days to </p><p>verify the candidates meet the requirements to run. </p><p>Political parties have been coy about announcing their </p><p>candidates and some potential candidates have not yet made a </p><p>final decision on their candidacy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>LET THE CAMPAIGNS BEGIN... </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The three day window to register as a candidate for </p><p>the June 17 Parliamentary elections began on May 18.  By May </p><p>19, the Minister of Interior had received 622 applications </p><p>from potential candidates for the 110 available seats.  After </p><p>the registration period closes, the GOJ will have four days </p><p>to vet the candidates and ensure they are qualified to run </p><p>(for details on candidate requirements, see Ref A). It </p><p>remains to be seen if the Ministry of Interior will deem </p><p>Circassian Toujan Faisal, who has announced her candidacy, </p><p>eligible to run, despite her felony conviction (see Ref B). </p><p>Although officially barred from campaigning until May 18, </p><p>many candidates have been discreetly luring supporters since </p><p>the King reaffirmed in April that elections would be held.  A </p><p>drive around Amman on May 18 revealed that some candidates </p><p>have already put up campaign banners, particularly in the </p><p>hotly contested third district, which includes West Amman. </p><p>Most banners so far have focused on fairly non-contentious </p><p>issues, such as the need for a Palestinian state. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Some political parties have been guarded about </p><p>releasing the names and numbers of their candidates.  The </p><p>Democratic Reform Bloc, which is comprised of six political </p><p>parties, announced only a partial list of candidates, most </p><p>likely because centrist parties in the bloc with tribal </p><p>candidates are wary about associating themselves with a bloc </p><p>that includes leftist parties. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Post anticipates even more candidates will join the </p><p>race before the May 20 deadline.  Some candidates by May 18 </p><p>had still not reached a decision about running and were </p><p>hedging their bets until they could view their competition. </p><p>One tribal contact was waiting to see how tribal politics </p><p>played out before officially submitting his candidacy--he </p><p>preferred to be the tribe\'s official candidate, but was vying </p><p>with two other tribal leaders for that role.  The 500JD </p><p>candidate fee may deter some candidates from running if the </p><p>candidate views he/she has little chance of winning. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>GOJ READYING ITSELF </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Minister of Interior, Qaftan Majali, whose </p><p>ministry oversees elections, on May 17 publicly stressed the </p><p>need for "free and fair" elections.  According to the English </p><p>daily Jordan Times, the GOJ has recruited 40,000 people to </p><p>supervise the elections in 45 constituencies.  Majali has </p><p>also asked construction companies and excavation companies to </p><p>halt work from June 1-June 20 to avoid damage to the phone </p><p>lines during election season. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Jordan will be the second Arab country to hold </p><p>post-war elections, and is eager to showcase its democracy, </p><p>particulary before the world spotlight focuses on the Kingdom </p><p>during the June 21-23 World Economic Forum. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
