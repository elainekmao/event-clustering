<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 003150 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR GUATEMALA COMMATT:DTHOMPSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, EINV, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: Congress Issues Favorable Report on InterAirports </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  On November 11, a congressional commission </p><p>released a favorable report finding that U.S.-led consortium </p><p>InterAirports, which was awarded the contract to manage </p><p>Honduras\' four international airports in October 2000, has </p><p>complied with all the terms of the concession contract. </p><p>InterAirport officials hope that the inquiry will clear the </p><p>consortium of any perceived non-compliance of the contract </p><p>and allow them to proceed with the next stages of the </p><p>project, principally the improvements in the airport in </p><p>Tegucigalpa.  InterAiports representatives thanked the </p><p>Embassy for its support and advice throughout.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  After a series of media attacks and complaints by </p><p>private sector groups, the National Congress named a special </p><p>commission in July to investigate InterAirports for possible </p><p>breach of contract.  The U.S.-led Interairports consortium </p><p>(51 percent U.S.-owned) took management control of Honduras\' </p><p>four international airports in October 2000.  Critics </p><p>charged that the San Francisco Airport Authority was not an </p><p>active, full partner in the consortium (participation of a </p><p>major airport was a requirement in the public tender and </p><p>subsequent contract) and that the company had not followed </p><p>through with investments.  They have also been criticized </p><p>for fee increases and critics questioned the concession </p><p>process itself. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The commission was comprised of seven congress deputies </p><p>and was charged with investigating the bidding process, the </p><p>contract and subcontracts and contract implementation plans. </p><p>The commission also held a series of meetings with private </p><p>sector associations and current and former GOH officials </p><p>responsible for negotiating and implementing the concession </p><p>contract.  InterAirports representatives provided over 2,000 </p><p>pages of supporting documentation to the commission. </p><p> </p><p>4.  On November 11, the congressional committee issued a </p><p>favorable report, finding that the concession process was </p><p>transparent and that Interairports has complied with all its </p><p>commitments under the concession contract, including correct </p><p>and appropriate involvement of San Francisco Airport </p><p>Authority.  The commission also found that delays in </p><p>contract-mandated investments, such as extending the runway </p><p>at the Tegucigalpa airport and building a new terminal, are </p><p>the result of government delays and inaction.  Construction </p><p>of the terminal is underway after the GOH settled a legal </p><p>dispute with a private party, permitting the demolition of </p><p>an old hangar on adjacent land that had been embargoed per a </p><p>court order. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The commission made a number of recommendations, mostly </p><p>directed toward the GOH, including expediting the </p><p>expropriation of land so that InterAirports can begin </p><p>extending the runway, providing the Superintendent of </p><p>Concessions with enough resources to supervise the </p><p>implementation of the concession contract and requiring the </p><p>Superintendent to submit a quarterly report to Congress on </p><p>the implementation of the contract. </p><p> </p><p>6.  In response to customer service complaints, </p><p>InterAirports representatives stated that they have begun to </p><p>focus on customer service training for Interairports </p><p>personnel.  They are trying to work more cooperatively with </p><p>the airlines on reducing landing fees at the four airports </p><p>and aircraft parking charges at the San Pedro Sula airport. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In a meeting with InterAirports representatives after </p><p>the commission reported its findings to Congress, Minister </p><p>without portfolio for investment Camilo Atala stated that </p><p>the GOH would support InterAirports and the terms of the </p><p>contract.  Before the study, President Maduro and other </p><p>government officials had publicly stated that InterAirports </p><p>had complied with the contract. </p><p> </p><p>8.  In a meeting with Emboffs, InterAirports thanked the </p><p>Embassy for its advocacy and advice.  They believe that the </p><p>Tegucigalpa airport construction will now proceed and that </p><p>the GOH will provide them long overdue documentation that </p><p>will allow them to solidify financing for the next stages. </p><p>In addition, they are interested in having the GOH complete </p><p>an inventory of the airport and stop aircraft with unpaid </p><p>bills from using the airport, both GOH commitments. </p><p> </p><p>9.  On an issue unrelated to the congressional inquiry, </p><p>InterAirports representatives indicated that the consortium </p><p>is willing to help the GOH build an international airport in </p><p>Copan in western Honduras, if desired.  The GOH and private </p><p>sector have been discussing the feasibility of building an </p><p>airport near the site of one of Honduras\' main tourism </p><p>attractions, the Mayan ruins of Copan.  The terms of the </p><p>concession contract prohibit the GOH from using government </p><p>financing to build a new international airport without the </p><p>consent of InterAirports. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Despite the fact that Adolfo Facusse, President of the </p><p>National Association of Industrialists (ANDI) and the person </p><p>who has been behind many of the attacks on InterAirports, </p><p>offered to cooperate with InterAirports representatives </p><p>during a recent meeting, we expect continued private sector </p><p>sniping.  Delays in construction projects, particularly at </p><p>the Tegucigalpa airport, have contributed to a souring of </p><p>public opinion of the concession process in general.  We </p><p>believe that the consortium is dedicated to improving their </p><p>public image and providing the users with better service. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
