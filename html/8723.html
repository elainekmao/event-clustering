(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Ambassador used the opportunity of a </p><p>June 10 meeting with de facto Foreign Minister </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayid (other topic septel, notal) </p><p>to discuss the status of Human Appeal </p><p>International.  The Ambassador noted that we would </p><p>be providing an intel package on HAI to assist the </p><p>UAEG with its own investigation.  Shaykh Hamdan </p><p>reiterated his commitment -- reported Ref A -- to </p><p>taking concrete action against HAI.  The Ambassador </p><p>asked whether there had been any result as yet from </p><p>the UAE\'s examination of HAI activities in </p><p>Mauritania, following the GIRM\'s decision to close </p><p>the HAI office in Nouakchott.  Shaykh Hamdan said </p><p>the UAEG had deployed a fact-finding team to </p><p>Nouakchott, but that the coup attempt in Mauritania </p><p>had temporarily set back the investigation; he </p><p>nonetheless reiterated his commitment to share with </p><p>us the results of that investigation as soon as it </p><p>is completed and once again noted that any </p><p>ammunition the USG could provice regarding HAI\'s </p><p>support for terrorism would help in the effort to </p><p>thoroughly rehabilitate the charity. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
