<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PDA (MBUCKLEY); WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON DRUG TRAFFICKING, JULY 9, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on </p><p>7/9 entitled "Narco trafficking and corruption". "Drug </p><p>trafficking has a considerable corrupting power, so much that </p><p>even the U.S. government has financed wars with funds coming from </p><p>this illegal source, such as the fight against the Sandinistas </p><p>during the `lost decade\'." </p><p> </p><p>"Drug trafficking does not exclusively promote corruption within </p><p>judicial institutions, public officials and politicians. It can </p><p>also overturn the moral values of common and ordinary people who </p><p>receive `aid\' from drug traffickers, no matter that such `aid\' </p><p>comes from the demise of millions of young people victims of </p><p>drugs and their tormented parents." </p><p> </p><p>"Honduras still has time to avoid that the powerful tentacles of </p><p>drug trafficking take advantage of the immorality and excessive </p><p>ambition of a few, as well as the needs and reversed values of </p><p>many. The fight against this current threat should concern all of </p><p>us, without regard of social class." </p><p> </p><p>2. Op-ed by Edmundo Orellana Mercado (former Attorney General in </p><p>a Liberal Party administration and Law Professor in the National </p><p>University) in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" on </p><p>7/9 entitled "Narco trafficking". "For some years now, our </p><p>society has been threatened by one of the most devastating </p><p>problems in modern times: narco trafficking. the environment in </p><p>which narco trafficking operates the best is through corruption. </p><p>Consequently, those societies who are headed by leaders inclined </p><p>to corruption are easy victims." </p><p> </p><p>"Then, we should not be surprised that our neighbors north of </p><p>Bravo River are repeatedly warning us that the failure of </p><p>Honduras\'s efforts on the fight against drug trafficking are </p><p>caused by the corruption of our leaders. The consequences of </p><p>ignoring those warnings could lead to the decertification of </p><p>Honduras, which could have a serious cost for the country by </p><p>reducing the international cooperation for Honduras." </p><p> </p><p>"We should fight against narco trafficking and corruption </p><p>relentlessly, in every front, and with all resources available. </p><p>Otherwise, corruption will asphyxiate us, and as a result of the </p><p>decertification we will be isolated from the world and suffering </p><p>its consequences by ourselves." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
