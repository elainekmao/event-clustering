<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003537 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA, EB, EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, EPET, IZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: DISCUSSION WITH MFA ON TURKEY-IRAQ TRADE AND </p><p>OIL/GAS SHIPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)   This cable contains an action request.  See para 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Summary:  DCM met with MFA Deputy U/S for Economic </p><p>Affairs Alev Kilic May 29 to discuss ways in which Turkey </p><p>could begin establishing a normal trading relationship with </p><p>Iraq.  Kilic said the MFA was ready to move forward on </p><p>swapping Iraqi refined fuel for Turkish LPG/benzine, getting </p><p>Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil flowing again, and normalizing </p><p>cross-border trade and transit with Iraq, but requested that </p><p>the U.S. provide information on each of these issues (see </p><p>action request para 8).  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU)  DCM emphasized to MFA Deputy U/S for Economic </p><p>Affairs Alev Kilic on May 29 that establishing normal trade </p><p>links between Turkey and Iraq was key to the reconstruction </p><p>of Iraq, and would also benefit Turkey\'s economy. DCM raised </p><p>three situations where Turkey could help.  First, he noted </p><p>that Iraq was facing a critical shortage of Liquid Petroleum </p><p>Gas (LPG) and benzine (gasoline).  The DCM said he understood </p><p>that SOMO had signed a barter contract with the Turkish </p><p>company Delta Petroleum, under which Delta would supply LPG </p><p>and benzine in return for Iraqi refined fuel oil, which Delta </p><p>would export to third countries.  Since the U.S. was </p><p>currently buying these products in Turkey and delivering them </p><p>to Iraq through U.S. military contractor KBR, a swap deal </p><p>with SOMO would help alleviate the shortage in Iraq while </p><p>saving the U.S. taxpayer tens of millions of dollars (and </p><p>providing business to Turkish companies).  DCM requested the </p><p>MFA\'s assistance in obtaining rapid GOT approval of the deal </p><p>(GOT approval is needed so the goods can cross the border.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU)  Kilic responded that the MFA team that had </p><p>recently traveled to Iraq had reported the LPG/benzine </p><p>shortage in Iraq.  He said the import of oil products from </p><p>Iraq was subject to certain restrictions and was governed by </p><p>the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat.  Kilic said the MFA would </p><p>look favorably on a swap deal, and would pass this on to the </p><p>Trade Undersecretariat.  (Note:  On May 28, Embassy had </p><p>arranged a meeting for Delta executives with Finance Minister </p><p>Unakitan, with whom Ambassador had previously raised this </p><p>issue.  During the meeting, Unakitan called the Foreign Trade </p><p>Under Secretary to instruct him to try to find a solution. </p><p>Foreign Trade chaired an interagency meeting on the subject </p><p>on May 29, which we understand was "positive" but took no </p><p>decision.  Late on May 30, Delta Petroleum executives called </p><p>to report that Finance Minister Unakitan had informed them </p><p>that the Foreign Minister would "clear" on the deal shortly, </p><p>and that he would personally take it to PM Erdogan for final </p><p>approval.  End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU)  The DCM said the second area where Turkey could </p><p>help was in getting the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil flow started </p><p>again. Kilic reponded that the GOT shared our interest in </p><p>resuming the flow, in part because the Turkish refinery at </p><p>Kirikalle was designed for Iraqi crude (reftel).  Kilic said </p><p>that state oil refining company Tupras was ready to start </p><p>importing crude from Iraq, but needed a contact name at SOMO. </p><p> DCM responded that we would try to provide the GOT a contact </p><p>at SOMO as soon as possible.  The DCM and Kilic agreed that </p><p>the status of the oil already in storage at Ceyhan (which was </p><p>pumped before sanctions were lifted) was not clear, and </p><p>agreed to raise this issue with their respective UN missions. </p><p> (Note:  Embassy subsequently obtained SOMO contact </p><p>information from ORHA staff and passed it to MFA and Tupras. </p><p>End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU)  Finally, DCM asked for the GOT\'s assistance in </p><p>establishing simplified procedures for the passage of cargo </p><p>and people at Habur Gate.  For example, DCM said, U.S. </p><p>military contractor KBR was now moving hundreds of Turkish </p><p>trucks across the border daily, and needed to send some of </p><p>its expat employees with these convoys.  Under current </p><p>procedures a U.S. citizen seeking to cross into Iraq at Habur </p><p>required approval from several GOT agencies after the embassy </p><p>sent diplomatic note, a process which rook weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.   (SBU)  Kilic responded that he had just participated in </p><p>an interagency meeting in which the GOT decided that May 22, </p><p>the day sanctions were lifted, marked the dawn of a new era </p><p>for transit and trade between Turkey and Iraq.  He said the </p><p>GOT would seek to normalize all transit and trade across the </p><p>border, including for non-Turkish citizens, as soon as </p><p>possible.  DCM and Kilic agreed that the entry requirements </p><p>for individuals seeking to enter Iraq were not clear, and DCM </p><p>said he would try to obtain this information if possible. </p><p>Kilic told DCM he would update us as soon as new procedures </p><p>were in place.  In the meantime, he said, the GOT wanted to </p><p>request U.S. assistance on the Iraqi side of the border. </p><p>Kilic said that although authorities in Iraq had announced </p><p>that no customs duties would be levied on imports into Iraq </p><p>until 2004, the "local administration" in Northern Iraq was </p><p>charging trucks from Turkey "fees" at whim.  He asked if the </p><p>U.S. could help resolve this situation.  MFA Coordinator for </p><p>Iraq Reconstruction Ambassador Ahmed Okcun echoed this </p><p>complaint in a May 29 conversation with EconCouns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.   (SBU)  Action request:  In order to respond to the GOT\'s </p><p>questions and concerns, and move these issues forward as soon </p><p>as possible, post requests Department and/or USUN\'s guidance </p><p>on the following issues: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The legal status of the oil in storage at Ceyhan, which </p><p>was pumped before sanctions were lifted; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Any information regarding entry requirements for </p><p>individuals seeking to travel to Iraq across the Turkish </p><p>border; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Any information Department can provide on the GOT\'s </p><p>claims that local groups are charging levies for imports from </p><p>Turkey into Northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
