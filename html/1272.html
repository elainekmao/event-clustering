(C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ATTENDED A DINNER SEPTEMBER </p><p>7 WITH A VARIETY OF RESIDENT AMBASSADORS AND A FEW </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS, DURING WHICH GIDEON GONO (PROTECT), </p><p>MANAGING DIRECTOR OF COMMERCIAL BANK OF ZIMBABWE (CBZ), </p><p>REPORTED A CREDIBLE STORY ABOUT NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p>MALFEASANCE IN THE ENERGY SECTOR.  BEFORE MUGABE </p><p>APPOINTED HIS NEW CABINET IN JULY, GONO HAD BEEN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S GO-TO MAN ON FINDING NEW SOURCES OF FUNDING </p><p>FOR ZIMBABWE\'S DWINDLING FUEL SUPPLIES.  GONO, A ZANU-PF </p><p>STALWART AND FRIEND OF MUGABE, WAS THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>NEGOTIATOR OF A KUWAITI/EUROPEAN BANKS OIL CREDIT LINE </p><p>EARLIER THIS YEAR DURING THE BEGINNING STAGES OF THE </p><p>FUEL CRISIS.  CBZ IS ALSO OFTEN THE LAST RESORT BANK TO </p><p>WHICH THE GOVERNMENT TURNS WHEN A PARTICULARLY ACUTE OR </p><p>ELEVENTH HOUR HARD CURRENCY PAYMENT MUST BE MADE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AN IRRITATED GONO REPORTED, HOWEVER, THAT SINCE </p><p>THE CABINET RESHUFFLE HE HAS BEEN SIDELINED ON OIL DEALS </p><p>IN FAVOR OF NEW MINES AND ENERGY MINISTER SIDNEY </p><p>SEKERAMAYI, HIS STAFF, AND OFFICIALS OF THE ZIMBABWE OIL </p><p>PARASTATAL NOCZIM.  APPARENTLY OUT OF DESPERATION, </p><p>SEKERAMAYI RECENTLY CALLED GONO FOR HELP IN RETAINING </p><p>AND TRYING TO EXPAND LINES OF CREDIT FROM SOUTH AFRICA\'S </p><p>ELECTRICITY AND OIL PARASTATALS.  GONO INFORMED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND A FEW OTHERS AT THE DINNER PARTY THAT AS </p><p>A RESULT, HE TRAVELED TO SOUTH AFRICA IN THE LAST WEEK </p><p>TO UNDERTAKE THESE CREDIT NEGOTIATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>ENERGY MINISTRY AND NOCZIM.  WHILE THERE, GONO LEARNED </p><p>FROM ESKOM AND SASOL OFFICIALS THAT "MORE THAN ONE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04999  081116Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE MINISTER AND A FEW OTHER NOTABLES FROM NORTH OF </p><p>THE BORDER" (GONO DID NOT NAME NAMES, ALTHOUGH </p><p>PRESUMEDLY ONE IS SEKERAMAYI) HAD ALREADY SENT LETTERS </p><p>TO ESKOM AND SASOL REQUESTING A CUT OF ALL NEW ENERGY </p><p>DEALS BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND ZIMBABWE BECAUSE THEY </p><p>OPERATED PERSONAL BUSINESSES THAT COULD ACT AS </p><p>MIDDLEMEN.  GONO DID NOT PROVIDE ANY FURTHER DETAILS OF </p><p>THE REQUEST OR PRODUCE THE LETTERS.  CHARITY NZENZA </p><p>(PROTECT), UNDERSECRETARY FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE\'S MFA, WAS AGHAST AT GONO\'S DISCLOSURE AND </p><p>LAMENTED THAT IT WAS OFFICIALS LIKE THOSE WHO CAUSED HER </p><p>TO WAIT IN LONG PETROL QUEUES WITH OTHER AVERAGE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS.  SHE SAID "WE ARE NOT STUPID; THE PUBLIC </p><p>KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: GIVEN HIS HISTORY AS THE GOZ\'S ENERGY </p><p>POINT MAN AND HIS VISIBLE DISPLEASURE AT BEING CUT OUT </p><p>OF THE LOOP, GONO\'S STORY APPEARS HIGHLY CREDIBLE TO US. </p><p>THE TALE IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE GOZ LEADERSHIP\'S </p><p>GROWING DETERMINATION TO GET WHILE THE GETTING IS STILL </p><p>POSSIBLE.  IF THIS STORY EVER FINDS ITS WAY INTO THE </p><p>MEDIA, THE PUBLIC OUTCRY WOULD BE ENORMOUS, WITH </p><p>SEKERAMAYI COMING UNDER VERY STRONG PRESSURE TO RESIGN. </p><p>WE ALSO STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT ANALAGOUS CASES OF </p><p>CORRUPTION AND PROFITEERING EXIST AT MANY OF THE OTHER </p><p>PARASTATALS, WITH A NUMBER OF CABINET OFFICIALS, TOP </p><p>RULING PARTY OFFICIALS, AND POLITICAL APPOINTEES ON THE </p><p>TAKE AT PUBLIC EXPENSE. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04999  081116Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
