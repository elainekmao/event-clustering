<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HANOI 000812 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE ROLE OF THINK TANKS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  02 Hanoi 2871     B.  Hanoi 0362 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY: The GVN supports an extensive network of </p><p>research institutes ("think tanks") under the National </p><p>Center for Social Sciences and Humanities (NCSSH).  Among </p><p>its 25 think tanks, five focus on Vietnam\'s external </p><p>relations.  While their influence appears modest, the think </p><p>tanks provide advice and information to GVN ministries (and </p><p>relatively candid opinions to emboffs, unusual in this </p><p>system) as part of the policy planning process.  Most </p><p>research projects are self-generated, but the think tanks </p><p>also respond to specific ministry requests; they likely have </p><p>more influence in the latter category.  Expansion of the </p><p>foreign affairs-related think tanks in the foreseeable </p><p>future is unlikely due to budget constraints and a lack of </p><p>trained personnel.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>A look at the NCSSH </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The NCSSH in its present incarnation has existed </p><p>since 1993.  A predecessor -- "the Department of Literature, </p><p>History and Geography" -- began  in 1953 and operated </p><p>through the war years but on a limited basis.  According to </p><p>Dr. Nguyen Giang Hai, NCSSH\'s Acting Director for </p><p>International Cooperation, the framework organization now </p><p>includes 25 entities and employs about 1,350 permanent </p><p>staff, mostly researchers, in its: </p><p>--  Center for China Studies; </p><p>-- Center for Japan Studies/Koreas Studies (Note:  The </p><p>Koreas Center is administratively part of the Center for </p><p>Japan Studies.  End Note); </p><p>-- Center for European Studies; </p><p>-- Center for North America Studies; </p><p>-- Institute of Southeast Asia Studies; </p><p>-- Institute of Philosophy; </p><p>-- Institute of Sociology; </p><p>-- Institute of Economics; </p><p>-- Institute of World Economy; </p><p>-- Institute of State and Law; </p><p>-- Institute of History; </p><p>-- Institute of Human Studies; </p><p>-- Institute of Archaeology; </p><p>-- Institute of Ethnology; </p><p>-- Institute of Literature; </p><p>-- Institute of Linguistics; </p><p>-- Institute of Folklore Studies; </p><p>-- Institute of Han Nom Studies (i.e., pre-romanized </p><p>Vietnamese script and literature); </p><p>-- Institute of Psychology; </p><p>-- Institute of Religious Studies; </p><p>-- Institute of Social Sciences in Ho Chi Minh City; </p><p>-- Center for Human Geography; </p><p>-- Center for Family and Women Studies; </p><p>-- Museum of Ethnology (which just co-organized the major </p><p>Vietnamese exhibition with the American Museum of Natural </p><p>History in New York City). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Most of the research at the five foreign affairs </p><p>think tanks is self-generated, Dr. Hai noted, while adding </p><p>that "about 15-20 percent" stems from direct requests from </p><p>various ministries (primarily Ministry of Foreign Affairs). </p><p>He guessed that this ratio likely varies among the think </p><p>tanks, however.  Dr. Hai added that most think tanks focus </p><p>their efforts in three areas:  (1) basic research to assist </p><p>the GVN in policy planning; (2) training students for MA and </p><p>PhD programs; and, (3) research on various aspects of social </p><p>sciences and humanities. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>CENTER FOR CHINA STUDIES </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Dr. Nguyen Tien Sam, Director of the China Studies </p><p>Center, noted that his Center researches subjects relevant </p><p>broadly to the PRC, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, but the </p><p>bulk of its work focuses on the PRC.  Researchers specialize </p><p>both in Chinese history as well as modern day conditions and </p><p>bilateral relations, including Vietnam/PRC and PRC/US.  Dr. </p><p>Sam said that, in recent years, the Center had "given </p><p>considerable attention" to the PRC\'s experience in economic </p><p>reform and how that experience may apply to Vietnam\'s own </p><p>reform efforts.  Other research focuses on predicting policy </p><p>trends in the PRC and how such trends might impact Vietnam. </p><p>Long and short-term research projects have examined Chinese </p><p>culture and society. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The Center has also hosted seminars with other </p><p>domestic and foreign research institutions (including a </p><p>lively half-day session on US-China relations featuring </p><p>Ambassador Burghardt in December 2002).  Dr. Sam highlighted </p><p>a recent seminar on the PRC\'s 16th Party Congress, which </p><p>examined its particular relevance to Vietnam (ref a).  Dr. </p><p>Sam admitted that the China Studies Center was not immune </p><p>from outside pressures, lamenting in particular that a </p><p>planned seminar on Vietnam - Taiwan relations, scheduled for </p><p>August 2002 in Hanoi, had been postponed due to "strong </p><p>objections" from the PRC Embassy in Hanoi (ref b).  The </p><p>seminar is now planned for April; however, the venue has </p><p>been switched to Taipei. </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>CENTER FOR NORTH AMERICA STUDIES </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (U)  Nguyen Thien Son, Director of the North America </p><p>Center, said that his Center focuses on Vietnam\'s political, </p><p>economic, cultural, social, and historical relations with </p><p>the United States, Canada, and Mexico.  The North America </p><p>Center views itself as a "bridge" between scholars and </p><p>businesspeople in North America and Vietnam, Son noted.  To </p><p>this end, the Center also produces articles and publications </p><p>in English on various North American political and economic </p><p>issues, although the bulk of its work remains in Vietnamese. </p><p>Dr. Son added that a major ongoing project is to examine </p><p>Vietnam - US relations under the present Administration. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Dr. Son estimated that "about 15 percent" of his </p><p>Center\'s work results from specific requests from </p><p>ministries, especially MFA.  There is normally "some </p><p>urgency" to these latter requests, he claimed.  Two recent </p><p>requests included analyses on US society after the September </p><p>11 attacks and on US - North Korea relations.  Other GVN </p><p>"clients" include the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and </p><p>the Ministry of Defense (MOD).  At the request of MFA, MOD, </p><p>and MPS, the Center is currently analyzing "US strategic </p><p>goals in Southeast Asia," Son claimed, highlighting the </p><p>interest of those two ministries in developing a long-term </p><p>strategy to counterbalance US policy.  MOD has now </p><p>additionally tasked the Center to examine "The Iraq War and </p><p>Its Consequences," according to Son. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>INSTITUTE FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA STUDIES </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Dr. Tran Khanh, Head of the Institute\'s Political </p><p>Research and International Relations Department, described </p><p>its foci as economic, political, historical, and cultural </p><p>issues among Southeast Asian countries (especially </p><p>bilaterally with Vietnam) as well as their relationships </p><p>with world powers, notably the U.S.  Dr. Khanh said that the </p><p>Institute also examines regional issues such as ASEAN\'s role </p><p>and development.  According to Dr. Khanh, the Institute\'s </p><p>main GVN clients are MFA, MOD, the Ministry of Trade, and </p><p>the Ministry of Planning and Investment.  At the request of </p><p>the MFA, the Center is now working on a project to analyze </p><p>Vietnam\'s future links with ASEAN, projecting ahead to 2010. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>CENTER FOR JAPAN/KOREAS STUDIES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Ngo Xuan Binh, Deputy Director of the Center for </p><p>Japan Studies (and concurrently Director of the Center for </p><p>Koreas Studies), said that his Center initially focused </p><p>mainly on Japanese politics, economy, history, society, </p><p>culture, and language.  Concerning Vietnam - Japan </p><p>relations, the Center has analyzed the bilateral </p><p>relationship since the implementation of Vietnam\'s "doi moi" </p><p>(renovation) policy in 1986, as well as changes in Japan\'s </p><p>foreign policy since the end of the Cold War.  Binh </p><p>described his Center\'s main purpose as assisting GVN policy </p><p>makers. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  In addition to research projects, Binh cited other </p><p>Center activities, including a seminar on Vietnam - Japan </p><p>relations planned for September 2003 to mark the 30th </p><p>anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations.  Binh added </p><p>that the Center also hosted a seminar in March comparing </p><p>education in Vietnam and Japan. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Not until 1998 did the NCSSH direct the Japan </p><p>Center to undertake research on the Koreas, Binh claimed, </p><p>and established a small Center for Koreas Studies under the </p><p>Japan Center.  Since then, the Koreas Center has primarily </p><p>looked at South Korea, because there is little information </p><p>available about North Korea and because the GVN views the </p><p>relationship with South Korea as "having more potential," </p><p>Binh added. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Binh noted that a March 2001 Center workshop on </p><p>administrative reforms in South Korea had attracted </p><p>"considerable interest from several GVN ministries."  More </p><p>recently, a December 2002 seminar on educational reforms in </p><p>South Korea was also "well attended," he added.  However, </p><p>Binh lamented that, while his Center regularly distributes </p><p>its journal and other publications to different government </p><p>agencies, "few officials read them." </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>CENTER FOR EUROPEAN STUDIES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Bui Nhat Quang, Deputy Chief of the Vietnam - </p><p>European Union (EU) Research Department of the Center for </p><p>European Studies, detailed research efforts on Vietnam\'s </p><p>relations with northern, western, and eastern Europe, the </p><p>EU, and Russia.  Major foci include EU development trends </p><p>and their significance for Vietnam, how to broaden Vietnam\'s </p><p>political and economic relationship with Europe,  and </p><p>assisting GVN ministries "better to understand Europe." </p><p>Quang noted that the Center is working on a three-year </p><p>project, funded by the EU, to establish a documentation </p><p>center that will provide more information about Europe as </p><p>well as improve the Center\'s research capabilities.  The </p><p>project also supports EU-related conferences, including a </p><p>February 2003 conference on ASEAN - EU relations. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Quang added that the Center\'s primary audience is </p><p>the MFA, but the Center also has "close relationships" with </p><p>local universities, especially Vietnam National University\'s </p><p>Faculty of International Studies.  Quang volunteered only </p><p>that his Center "occasionally" implements projects in </p><p>response to on specific GVN requests/taskings. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>LIMITED IMPACT </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  According to the NCSSH\'s Dr. Hai, the foreign </p><p>policy think tanks, while tasked "to advise" the GVN, are </p><p>not a major component of the decision-making process but </p><p>"may have some limited influence."  Dr. Hai pointed out that </p><p>"one must differentiate between general research and work </p><p>performed at a ministry\'s request."  If a request is </p><p>"urgent," it is likely to be given more attention and "have </p><p>more impact," he claimed.  Dr. Hai added that think tank </p><p>officials also exert a "certain amount of influence" as </p><p>advisors to GVN delegations on overseas missions. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  According to Nguyen Thanh Huy, a senior expert </p><p>from the MFA\'s ASEAN Department, think tank materials serve </p><p>as "useful references, but have a limited audience." </p><p>However, he agreed that when a think tank performs an </p><p>analysis based on a specific request, "it has more </p><p>influence."  Separately, Nguyen Thi Thanh Thuy, Deputy Dean </p><p>at Vietnam National University\'s Faculty of International </p><p>Studies, said that her staff and students "do not generally </p><p>pay much attention" to think tank materials, while claiming </p><p>that her faculty had a "good relationship" with the foreign </p><p>affairs think tanks.  Thuy added that the amount of "new </p><p>research" the think tanks performed was "limited."   She </p><p>observed that "much of what they publish" was material </p><p>translated from foreign sources.  Dang Hoang Giang, senior </p><p>expert at the MFA\'s Laws and Treaties Department, said </p><p>separately that he and his colleagues pay "little attention" </p><p>to think tank material.  He could not recall any specific </p><p>research requests made by his department recently to any of </p><p>the foreign affairs think tanks. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>ADDITIONAL THINK TANKS UNLIKELY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U)  According to Tran Thi Lan Anh, Deputy Director of </p><p>NCSSH\'s International Cooperation Department, NCSSH has </p><p>requested that the Prime Minister\'s office authorize </p><p>additional research institutes to specialize in the Middle </p><p>East and Africa.  However, Anh admitted that, while the GVN </p><p>"understands the importance of these areas," separate </p><p>centers were "unlikely" for the foreseeable future due to </p><p>budget constraints and a lack of qualified personnel. </p><p>Research and analysis projects are also carried out by the </p><p>MFA, especially its Institute for International Relations. </p><p>Anh commented that most MFA officers are "too busy" with </p><p>other work to perform significant research, however. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U)  The GVN spends a surprising amount of its limited </p><p>budgetary resources on these research institutes, apparently </p><p>to no particularly meaningful purpose apart perhaps from </p><p>employment generation among intellectuals.  The think tanks </p><p>nonetheless seem to have found a somewhat complementary </p><p>niche, performing tasks that ministries have neither the </p><p>time nor resources to undertake, and increasingly reaching </p><p>out to regional and international counterparts.  Of most </p><p>relevance to the USG, think tankers are among the embassy\'s </p><p>more open, accessible, and knowledgeable interlocutors (even </p><p>to the extent sometimes of offering personal views, unusual </p><p>in this system), even if their GVN audience is not reading </p><p>their reports. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
