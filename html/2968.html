<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001538 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP, S/CT. AF/W, AND AF/EPS; </p><p>DEPT PASS TO TREASURY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PTER, PREL, KPAO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TERRORISM FINANCE: REGULATION OF OVERSEAS </p><p>CHARITIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 90100 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: HOWARD F. JETER, AMBASSADOR, REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p>1. (U) Nigeria officially regulates all corporate bodies and </p><p>non-governmental organizations (including charities and </p><p>religious organizations) through registration with the </p><p>Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC).  The registration process </p><p>requires a one-time fee, a filing of papers on the </p><p>organization\'s charter and purpose, data on the </p><p>organization\'s principal officers, a background police check </p><p>of those principals, and advertisements about the </p><p>organization in the public media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) However, most indigenous Nigerian charitable </p><p>organizations, especially local charities formed around </p><p>mosques and churches, avoid the rather expensive and </p><p>complicated CAC registration process.  Larger and more </p><p>sophisticated organizations, especially those which will look </p><p>to the Nigerian Government or foreign donors for funds, tend </p><p>to register.  All foreign charities and foreign-based NGOs </p><p>are expected to register and do so.  Once registered, very </p><p>few organizations comply with regulations by sending in the </p><p>periodic updates on structure and personnel.  The CAC is </p><p>among the less effective Nigerian government offices. Its </p><p>main office in Abuja has no working telephones.  It is safe </p><p>to say that the CAC cannot adequately track the activities of </p><p>charitable organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Nigeria\'s State Security Services (SSS) actively </p><p>monitors religious groups and services, both Christian and </p><p>Muslim, in an attempt to predict, and if possible prevent, </p><p>inter-religious and ethnic violence.  The SSS pay particular </p><p>attention to Muslim missionary activities.  Organized </p><p>teaching by foreign Muslim scholars has a centuries-long </p><p>history in Nigeria.  Among the larger groups proselytizing in </p><p>Nigeria are organizations with bases in Saudi Arabia, </p><p>Pakistan, and Sudan.  Groups with ties to Iran, Iraq and </p><p>Libya also exist, and are closely watched by the SSS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As far as we know, Nigeria is not a source of </p><p>significant funding for any international charities.  It is </p><p>more often a destination country, especially for charities </p><p>focused on construction of mosques.  We do not believe that </p><p>pushing for more strenuous regulation of charities would be </p><p>well received or effective.  Due to its undisciplined and </p><p>opaque financial system and lack of adequate oversight of </p><p>charitable organizations, Nigeria is potentially attractive </p><p>to terrorist for money laundering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We believe that Nigerian authorities (the Central </p><p>Bank, SSS, Ministry of Finance) will take effective action </p><p>when provided  information on charities being used for </p><p>financing terrorist activities.  Rather than try to change </p><p>Nigerian public policy on charities, we suggest continuing to </p><p>work closely with GON authorities (particularly through </p><p>training programs) to enlist their aid in identifying abuses </p><p>of charities, and stopping those abuses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) As we deliberate measures aimed at terrorist financing </p><p>through charities, we need to be aware of a possible public </p><p>diplomacy downside which must be factored into plans. </p><p>Targeting Muslim charities moves us into a sensitive area. </p><p>We risk being perceived as going after organizations that "do </p><p>good" in the community without bringing in any </p><p>counterbalancing relief.  This opens us to charges of being </p><p>"anti-Muslim," and this can be used by radical elements to </p><p>sway Muslim public opinion against us.  Even the most </p><p>educated and informed moderate Muslim will be negatively </p><p>influenced, perhaps profoundly so.  Consequently, we must do </p><p>a much better job of educating the public that some purported </p><p>charities are alleged front organizations for terrorism, and </p><p>that terrorism is not just directed at the U.S. but may have </p><p>domestic repercussions as well.  Said plainly, we must be </p><p>able to provide evidence to the public.  Announcing measures </p><p>while responding to criticism with "we can\'t discuss specific </p><p>evidence" will not do.  We must also broaden our interaction </p><p>with Muslims and enhance our presence among them, including </p><p>provision of additional economic developmental assistance. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
