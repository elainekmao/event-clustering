Under headline "Humanitarian disaster in Iraq" </p><p>      the pro-government daily "The Daily Mirror" dedicated </p><p>      its March 27 editorial to urging the United Nations to </p><p>      provide emergency food and medical aid to the civilian </p><p>      population in Iraq.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The stories and reports of U. S. and </p><p>      Britain carpet bombing Baghdad and other Iraq cities. </p><p>      . .are graphically compelling.  With `live\' television </p><p>      coverage of the war from the `embedded\' reporters and </p><p>      cameramen and women, the media have apparently </p><p>      forgotten to tell us the grim realities of the other </p><p>      side of the story - the immense suffering of civilian </p><p>      men, women and children during the course of this war. </p><p>      . .  Iraqi civilians and not those from the invading </p><p>      countries - are facing tremendous hardships as the war </p><p>      has disrupted their access to food and water which </p><p>      forces them to join hundreds of thousands of people </p><p>      already displaced from their homes. . .  What is </p><p>      unfolding in Iraq is a humanitarian disaster of </p><p>      mammoth proportions. . .  Although war had been </p><p>      predicted for months, donor governments and U.N. </p><p>      agencies have not openly prepared for the humanitarian </p><p>      emergency. . .  The international community must fight </p><p>      to ensure that the humanitarian needs and security of </p><p>      the civilian population are taken care of to address </p><p>      the humanitarian consequences of this war that could </p><p>      have been avoided had sense prevailed.  The U. N. must </p><p>      allow Iraqis access to emergency food and medical aid. </p><p>      . .  If the world looks aside, the tragedy being </p><p>      played in the Gulf may be too ghastly to contemplate." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
