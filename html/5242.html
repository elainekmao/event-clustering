<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000495 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, NEA CROCKER, NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE; OSD FOR LUTI </p><p>AND HRHODE; NSC FOR KHALILZAD; LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; </p><p>DAMASCUS FOR WALKER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, TU, IZ, PHUM, PREF, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKEY\'S "PEACE INITIATIVE" - NOT PREP MTG, </p><p>FM\'S TO ATTEND IN INSTANBUL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 16544 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 302 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 201 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 461 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 484 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons:  1.5b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) DDG/Mideast Safak Gokturk told Pol-MilCouns 1/21 that </p><p>Turkey\'s "Peace Initiative" meeting would go ahead as planned </p><p>on 1/23 in Istanbul.  However, it will be at ministerial </p><p>rather than summit level.  All Foreign Ministers have agreed </p><p>to attend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Gokturk was reluctant to characterize the meeting as </p><p>"preparatory" since the MFA was not sure whether it would be </p><p>the last such meeting.  That would depend on what happened in </p><p>Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Regarding the declaration, Pol-MilCouns stressed that </p><p>our goal is to send the strongest possible signal to Saddam. </p><p>If the statement is "balanced" with criticism of the US, it </p><p>will be terribly counterproductive.  Gokturk said that the </p><p>declaration had not been discussed with the other countries </p><p>but that Turkey would do its best to keep criticism of the US </p><p>out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Finally, Gokturk went over the points his boss DG </p><p>Burcuoglu had made with the DCM (reftel), adding that Iran </p><p>had pressed for Kuwaiti inclusion "for its own reasons." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
