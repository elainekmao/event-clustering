(C) ON JUNE 8 AMBASSADOR MCDONALD SPOKE WITH MINISTRY </p><p>OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT SECRETARY MACHIVENYIKA </p><p>MAPURANGA TO REITERATE OUR DESIRE TO SOLVE QUICKLY THE </p><p>REFUGEE CASE OF CUBAN DOCTORS LEONEL CORDOVA RODRIGUEZ </p><p>AND NORIS PENA MARTINEZ.  THE AMBASSADOR INFORMED THE </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY THAT WE HAD HEARD FROM THE LOCAL </p><p>UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE THAT CUBAN AMBASSADOR RODOLFO </p><p>SARRACINO WAS PRESSURING THE MFA TO HAND OVER THE </p><p>CUBANS, A REQUEST THE AMBASSADOR EXPECTED THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD EXERCISE ITS SOVEREIGNTY TO DENY.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ALSO ASKED WHAT WOULD BE THE OPINION OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT IF THE CUBANS WERE REMOVED TO </p><p>ANOTHER COUNTRY PENDING COMPLETION OF IMMIGRATION </p><p>FORMALITIES FOR THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MAPURANGA REPLIED THAT AS FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03105  091105Z </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE WAS CONCERNED THE CUBANS COULD GO WHERE THEY </p><p>WISHED; THE MATTER WAS NOW THE COMPETENCE OF UNHCR AND </p><p>THE RECEIVING COUNTRY.  RESPONDING TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>REMARK ABOUT THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR\'S EFFORTS, THE </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY SAID THAT HIS MINISTRY DID NOT </p><p>CHANGE ITS POSITION WITH "EVERY GUST OF WIND." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD LATER SPOKE WITH ACTING </p><p>CHIEF IMMIGRATION OFFICER MR. KARAGA TO SECURE THE </p><p>LATTER\'S COOPERATION IN ARRANGING ACCESS TO THE CUBANS </p><p>FOR EMBASSY CONSULAR OFFICER HEBRON AND NAIROBI INS </p><p>OFFICER SANJEETA VARSANI.  THE CUBANS OPTED TO REMAIN IN </p><p>THE GOROMONZI DETENTION FACILITY AS THEY WOULD CONTINUE </p><p>TO BE HELD TOGETHER AND, IN ANY EVENT, LIVING CONDITIONS </p><p>WERE OSTENSIBLY BETTER THAN IN THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE\'S </p><p>TRANSIT CAMP, ACCORDING TO LOCAL UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>JOHN ADU.  THE CHIEF IMMIGRATION OFFICER DISCLAIMED </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISSUE AND TRANSFERRED THE CALL TO THE </p><p>ACTION IMMIGRATION OFFICER, WHO INSISTED THAT THE UNHCR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE CONTACT HIM DIRECTLY WITH THE REQUEST. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR THEN SPOKE WITH UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE JOHN </p><p>ADU, WHO REPORTED THAT HE ALREADY HAD BEEN IN CONTACT </p><p>WITH THE ACTION OFFICER, BUT WOULD SEEK A FACE-TO-FACE </p><p>MEETING.  AS THIS CABLE IS BEING ISSUED, THE INS OFFICER </p><p>AND EMBASSY CONSULAR OFFICER ARE ON THEIR WAY TO </p><p>GOROMONZI DETENTION FACILITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: WE CONTINUE TO THINK THAT EVACUATING </p><p>THE CUBANS FROM ZIMBABWE IS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION TO </p><p>ENSURE THEIR WELFARE.  IN FACT, AMBASSADOR MCDONALD </p><p>STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT THEY BE IMMEDIATELY REMOVED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03105  091105Z </p><p>FROM ZIMBABWE TO THE U.S. OR A THIRD COUNTRY.  NO MATTER </p><p>HOW MANY ASSURANCES WE RECEIVE FROM THE GOZ, IT IS STILL </p><p>QUITE POSSIBLE SOMETHING SINISTER IS AFOOT.  OUR </p><p>PREFERENCE WOULD BE FOR THEM TO GO TO THE U.S. FOR </p><p>PROCESSING OR CANADA, IF THEY MUST GO TO A THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>PENDING COMPLETION OF THEIR MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS OR </p><p>OTHER INS FORMALITIES.  A THIRD OPTION WOULD BE KENYA. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
