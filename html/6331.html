<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 001595 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI OPPOSITION TALKS IN ANAKARA: TURKS ON BOARD </p><p>FOR THREE SETS OF TALKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 66506 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1512 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 1487 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) On March 13, DCM met MFA Director General for the </p><p>Middle East Burcuoglu and delivered Ref A points.  Burcuoglu </p><p>agreed to the following schedule: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- US-TU bilaterals, with Turkey represented by Deputy U/S </p><p>Tuygan, at 17:00 on March 14, followed by a March 15 session </p><p>from 10:00 to 13:00.  A TGS representative, as well as other </p><p>Turkish representatives, are TBD.  DCM committed to informing </p><p>the Turks as soon as possible regarding the identity of </p><p>representatives from OVP and CENTCOM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- US-TU-KDP-PUK-ITF talks on March 18.  The GOT proposes </p><p>that it inform the KDP, PUK, and ITF to prepare to meet in </p><p>Ankara on that day.  However, the Turks intend to await the </p><p>outcome of the bilats before issuing formal invitations to </p><p>the other three parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Talks with the wider Iraqi opposition late on March 18 or, </p><p>more probably, on March 19.  As with the earlier March 18 </p><p>five-party meeting, the GOT intends to inform the wider </p><p>opposition of the possibility of a meeting, but will refrain </p><p>from issuing formal invitations until the bilats are </p><p>underway, at the earliest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) Burcuoglu questioned whether the KDP, PUK, and ITF </p><p>would be prepared to meet with the wider opposition, and </p><p>suggested that we discuss this issue further at the bilats. </p><p>The GOT is not willing to present the meeting with the wider </p><p>Iraqi opposition as a meeting with the "Leadership Committee" </p><p>unless an ITF representative has become a committee member. </p><p>Burcuoglu said that if the ITF were represented on the </p><p>Leadership Committee by March 18, it would "facilitate </p><p>everything.8 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) DCM forcefully reminded Burcuoglu that, in the </p><p>absence of Turkish parliamentary permission for a US troop </p><p>deployment in Turkey, we cannot present positions to the </p><p>Kurds based on the military MOU or the economic and political </p><p>joint statements.  Moreover, DCM reminded Burcuoglu of the </p><p>USG,s firm opposition to a unilateral Turkish deployment in </p><p>northern Iraq.  He stressed that in the meetings we would be </p><p>focused on ending provocations and avoiding conflict. </p><p>Burcuoglu responded that the GOT would tell the Kurds that if </p><p>Turkish troops were to enter Iraq, it would only be on the </p><p>basis of coordination with the USG.  He acknowledged that the </p><p>GOT fully understands the USG position on Turkish troops in </p><p>northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) Action Requested: Please advise on the remaining </p><p>composition of the delegation, including an authoritative </p><p>CENTCOM participant.  We will also need resolution of the ITF </p><p>membership in the Leadership Committee issue now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
