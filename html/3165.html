HANOI 1432     B. HANOI 1485 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY POL/C SCOTT BELLARD, REASON: 1.5 </p><p>(D) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01571  01 OF 02  191009Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY.  AN EXPECTED CPV PLENUM IN JULY </p><p>SHOULD MAKE FINAL DECISIONS ON THE NEW GVN LEADERSHIP </p><p>LINE-UP, AND MAY ALSO BLESS PUNISHMENTS AGAINST SEVERAL </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS BELIEVED TO BE GUILTY OF CORRUPTION OR </p><p>OTHER WRONG-DOING.  THESE BEHIND-THE-SCENES </p><p>DELIBERATIONS REMAIN DIFFICULT TO VERIFY, AND WE EXPECT </p><p>VARIOUS RUMORS WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE UNTIL THE </p><p>DETAILS HAVE BEEN PINNED DOWN IN PRIVATE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  ACCORDING TO LE THO BINH, CHIEF OF THE </p><p>EDITORIAL BOARD OF "COUNTRYSIDE TODAY," THE SIXTH </p><p>PLENUM OF THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) HAS BEEN DELAYED SEVERAL TIMES </p><p>DUE TO ONGOING INTERNAL DEBATES ABOUT THE NEW GVN </p><p>LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE THAT WILL BE VOTED UPON BY THE </p><p>11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) IN JULY (REF A).  THE NA </p><p>MUST BY LAW MEET BY JULY 19 -- WITHIN TWO MONTHS FROM </p><p>THE MAY ELECTIONS -- AND SEVERAL NA SOURCES HAVE </p><p>SEPARATELY PREDICTED THE OPENING DATE WILL BE JULY 14. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  BINH, PREVIOUSLY A HARD-CHARGING INVESTIGATIVE </p><p>REPORTER WITH TUOI TRE NEWSPAPER, TOLD POLOFF ON JUNE </p><p>18 THAT THE PLENUM HAD INITIALLY BEEN PROPOSED FOR JUNE </p><p>15 OR 17, BUT WILL NOW MORE PROBABLY BEGIN O/A JULY 5. </p><p>BINH\'S CPV SOURCES HAVE CLAIMED THAT THE NINE OUT OF </p><p>THE FIFTEEN POLIBURO MEMBERS HAVE AGREED THAT PRIME </p><p>MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI SHOULD REMAIN IN OFFICE FOR NOW, </p><p>A RUMOR THAT IS ALSO WIDELY CIRCULATING ELSEWHERE. </p><p>PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG, DANANG PARTY CHIEF PHAN DIEN, </p><p>MASS MOBILIZATION CHIEF TRUONG QUANG DUOC, AND ECONOMIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01571  01 OF 02  191009Z </p><p>COMMISSION CHIEF TRUONG TAN SANG REPORTEDLY HAD </p><p>NONETHELESS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT WITHIN THE </p><p>POLITBURO FOR DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG TO </p><p>MOVE INTO THE TOP SPOT THIS SUMMER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  MINISTER OF TRADE VU KHOAN IS STILL SEEN BY </p><p>BINH\'S CONTACTS (AND OTHERS) TO BE THE HANDS-ON </p><p>FAVORITE TO MOVE UP TO A DPM POSITION, MOST PROBABLY </p><p>THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS/TRADE SLOT NOW FILLED BY DPM NGUYEN </p><p>MANH CAM.  THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION THAT THE </p><p>NUMBER OF DPM SLOTS COULD DECLINE FROM FOUR TO THREE </p><p>WITH THE EXPECTED RETIREMENTS OF DPM CAM AND DPM NGUYEN </p><p>CONG TAN.  FORMER MINISTER OF TRADE AND CURRENT NGHE AN </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY BOSS TRUONG DINH TUYEN IS RUMORED TO </p><p>BE A FAVORITE TO REPLACE VU KHOAN AT MOT, DESPITE </p><p>WISHES OF SOME SENIOR MOT OFFICIALS FOR AN IN-HOUSE </p><p>CANDIDATE AND SOME DISSATISFACTION WITH TUYEN\'S EARLIER </p><p>PERFORMANCE AT MOT (INCLUDING OVER BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT NEGOTIATIONS). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE WIDELY-RUMORED RETIREMENT OF MINISTER OF </p><p>PUBLIC SECURITY LT. GENERAL LE MINH HUONG IS REPORTEDLY </p><p>RUNNING INTO DIFFICULTIES IN LIGHT OF ALLEGATIONS </p><p>AGAINST CURRENT VICE MINISTERS (PARA 8).  SOME OF </p><p>BINH\'S CONTACTS HAVE SPECULATED THAT EXTENSION OF MPS\' </p><p>HUONG MIGHT "FOR BALANCE" NECESSITATE A SIMILAR </p><p>EXTENSION OF MINISTER OF DEFENSE LT. GENERAL PHAM VAN </p><p>TRA, WHO WAS RE-ELECTED TO THE NA IN MAY.  (MOD </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE SEPARATELY INDICATED THAT GENERAL TRA </p><p>WILL STILL BE IN PLACE THIS FALL TO ACCEPT THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF DEFENSE\'S RECIPROCAL INVITATION TO VISIT.) </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01571  01 OF 02  191009Z </p><p>OTHER SOURCES HAVE INDICATED THAT MINISTER OF JUSTICE </p><p>LOC IS A SURE BET TO STEP DOWN; MOJ CONTACTS HAVE TOLD </p><p>POLOFFS PRIVATELY THAT VICE MINISTER UONG CHU LUU </p><p>(ALREADY A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER AND NA DELEGATE) </p><p>WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY REPLACE LOC, WHICH WILL PROBABLY </p><p>MAKE LUU THE YOUNGEST MINISTER.  AT THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>PLANNING AND INVESTMENT, MINISTER TRAN XUAN GIA IS </p><p>WIDELY EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN IN FAVOR OF VICE MINISTER </p><p>VO HONG PHUC. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  ACCORDING TO BINH\'S SOURCES, THE CPV\'S </p><p>INVESTIGATION COMMISSION WILL ALSO REPORT TO THE PLENUM </p><p>ON A NUMBER OF HIGH-RANKING CPV MEMBERS AND GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS WHO SHOULD FACE CENSURE AND/OR PUNISHMENT; </p><p>15 OF THEM ARE REPORTEDLY NEW NA MEMBERS.  AMONG THE </p><p>EXPECTED VICTIMS ARE FORMER "VOICE OF VIETNAM" DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL TRAN MAI HANH AND MPS VICE MINISTER BUI QUOC </p><p>HUY, BOTH OF WHOM HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THE ONGOING </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF HO CHI MINH CITY "MAFIA" KING "NAM </p><p>CAM" (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>8.

(C)  COMMENT:  MUCH IS AT STAKE IN THE LEADERSHIP </p><p>SWEEPSTAKES, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF PERSONAL FIEFDOMS BUT </p><p>ALSO IN CONVINCING THE PUBLIC THAT THE CPV AND GVN TAKE </p><p>SERIOUSLY THESE ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION AND </p><p>MISCONDUCT AND ARE PREPARED TO MOVE AGAINST EVEN SENIOR </p><p>RANKING OFFICIALS.  THE EXTENSIVE MEDIA COVERAGE GIVEN </p><p>TO THE NAM CAM CASE CANNOT BE FAVORABLE FOR THE </p><p>PROMOTION ASPIRATIONS OF HCMC PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN MINH </p><p>TRIET, ANOTHER FRONT-RUNNER AS EVENTUAL SUCCESSOR TO PM </p><p>KHAI.  THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN MAY INDEED BE AN INDIRECT </p><p>POLITICAL ATTACK ON TRIET HIMSELF.   WE EXPECT THE </p><p>RUMOR MILL TO CONTINUE TO FLOURISH IN THE RUN-UP TO THE </p><p>PARTY PLENUM AND NA OPENING SESSION.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>WE PREDICT A PUBLIC SHOW OF UNITY WITHIN THE CPV AND NA </p><p>ONCE THESE PERSONNEL AND PUNISHMENT DECISIONS ALIKE </p><p>HAVE BEEN MADE IN PRIVATE. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
