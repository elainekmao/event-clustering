<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 003536 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF CONCLUDES STAFF MISSION:  STILL MUCH WORK TO DO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3206 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  IMF Mission Director told us May 30 that, </p><p>while the staff mission had gone somewhat better than he </p><p>expected, Turkish authorities still had much work to do in </p><p>the next 10-14 days if they hoped to see a Fund board review </p><p>by end-June.  The government needs to adopt new fiscal </p><p>measures to address worrisome underlying budget trends.  On </p><p>the structural side, the GOT is behind schedule, and has </p><p>promised to try to accelerate Parliamentary action on key </p><p>legislation.  Most important is rapid passage of legislation </p><p>governing social security institutions.  Turkish authorities </p><p>have promised to tailor public procurement law amendments and </p><p>the proposed rescheduling of social security arrears to Fund </p><p>address concerns; Kakhonen is skeptical but is taking a </p><p>wait-and-see approach.   End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) IMF Mission Director Juha Kakhonen provided us with </p><p>an outbrief this morning on the just-concluded staff mission. </p><p> He said the mission had gone somewhat better than he </p><p>expected, but added that his expectations had been low. The </p><p>bottom line, he said, was that, if the GOT makes a strong </p><p>effort in the next 1-2 weeks, it might be possible to </p><p>schedule the Fifth Review before the end of June. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Need for More Fiscal Measures </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>3.  (SBU) The Fund still does not have final fiscal data for </p><p>the first four months, but believes Turkey probably met the </p><p>primary surplus targets.  However, this success disguises </p><p>worrisome underlying trends.  The Central Government </p><p>underperformed, due to weaker-than-projected revenues, even </p><p>counting the higher-than-expected revenues from the tax </p><p>amnesty program.   The explanation, per Fund staff, lies in </p><p>part in the negative impact of the tax amnesty, which they </p><p>believe has weakened overall compliance while generating an </p><p>increase in certain tax refunds (which are paid out </p><p>immediately, while payments of arrears are made over time). </p><p>Other factors include below-target social security </p><p>collections, which Kakhonen again blamed on expectations of </p><p>an amnesty, and the government\'s failure to implement price </p><p>increases on items such as electricity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) </p><p>overperformed, but this overperformance is not sustainable, </p><p>per Fund staff.  Kakhonen explained that SEEs had delayed </p><p>expenditures in the first quarter because of the tight </p><p>interim budget and problems caused by the procurement law. </p><p>However, he expects the SEEs to "catch up" during the </p><p>remainder of the year, and thus not to overperform in budget </p><p>terms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) To rectify the situation, the Fund is insisting </p><p>that the government adopt new fiscal measures in the next </p><p>7-10 days.  GOT bureaucrats already have identified measures </p><p>that would fill most of the expected gap, but the politicians </p><p>still have to approve them.  According to Kakhonen, State </p><p>Minister Babacan briefed the cabinet on the budget situation </p><p>on May 28.  The Ministers, who have been hearing nothing but </p><p>positive reports (especially by Finance Minister Unakitan) </p><p>about how the tax amnesty is providing excess revenue, were </p><p>apparently shocked to learn the true situation.  Kakhonen </p><p>hopes that shock will spur them into agreeing to additional </p><p>measures rapidly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Kakhonen commented on three other </p><p>amnesties/reschedulings that have been in the news: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- electricity arrears:  The GOT already approved an amnesty </p><p>that violates the LOI.  GOT officials offered the weak excuse </p><p>that the state-owned electricity distribution company (TEDAS) </p><p>had decided, on its own, to implement the amnesty.  To </p><p>compensate for this move, the Fund has insisted that the </p><p>draft LOI include a provision committing the GOT to cut off </p><p>electricity supplies to any customer who develops new arrears; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- farm debt to Ziraat Bank:  Fund staff does not have a </p><p>problem with the state bank\'s decision to reschedule certain </p><p>agricultural loans because the bank had already determined </p><p>that the loans in question were non-performing and had </p><p>written them down to zero; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- social security arrears:  This is the big one.  Under </p><p>intense Fund pressure, GOT authorities have agreed not to </p><p>proceed with a broad amnesty, but instead to insert a clause </p><p>in new social security legislation that would allow </p><p>rescheduling of certain arrears.  Per Kakhonen, the Fund </p><p>could accept some type of rescheduling provision, as long as </p><p>it was drafted in consultation with Fund staff and authorized </p><p>reschedulings only for those unable to pay (rather than </p><p>indiscriminately).  However, the first draft of the </p><p>legislation the GOT presented to the Fund looked like a </p><p>general amnesty, so Fund staff is awaiting a revised version. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>More to Do on Structural Side </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>7.  (SBU) On the structural side, there have been numerous </p><p>delays.  When the Mission arrived, the GOT had completed only </p><p>one of the eight structural benchmarks for April-May (having </p><p>to do with Central Bank internal auditing).  Kakhonen\'s sense </p><p>is that the authorities, having completed the Fourth Review </p><p>and seeing market sentiment improve significantly, relaxed a </p><p>bit.  During the mission, the leadership woke up and realized </p><p>they needed to move on a series of legislative measures.  As </p><p>a result, they have promised to try to accelerate </p><p>Parliamentary approval of key legislation, including new laws </p><p>governing the social security institutions and bankruptcy. </p><p>Even so, Kakhonen expects most legislation will be delayed </p><p>for at least one month (though Parliament may approve the new </p><p>foreign investment law more quickly). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The government is also behind on some end-June </p><p>targets, including laying off redundant workers at SEEs and </p><p>passing the Public Financial Management Reform law.  Although </p><p>the GOT technically does not have to meet these targets if </p><p>the board review takes place before June 30, Fund staff will </p><p>have to be able to say the reforms are on track. If the </p><p>review is delayed, of course, these and other end-June </p><p>targets come fully into play. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Kakhonen addressed three other "problem areas": </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- public procurement law:  although the government is still </p><p>planning to amend this law, Kakhonen believes things are now </p><p>moving in a better direction.  Fund staff accept the need for </p><p>some revisions, particularly regarding the treatment of some </p><p>SEEs, such as utility companies.  Also, the GOT procurement </p><p>agency -- which had been complaining about being ignored -- </p><p>now tells the Fund that it is fully involved in drafting the </p><p>amendments.  The Fund will continue to watch this closely to </p><p>ensure the GOT does not weaken the law; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- law on independent regulatory agencies:  Fund staff is </p><p>worried that this legislation might weaken the independent </p><p>agencies.  So far, per Kakhonen, GOT officials have been </p><p>"telling us what we want to hear."  Fund staff have not seen </p><p>a draft, and are waiting for the GOT to fill in some gaps in </p><p>the draft LOI on this issue; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turk Telekom privatization:  The "plan" the GOT approved </p><p>in April was insufficient.  In the past few days, the World </p><p>Bank and GOT have clarified what is needed to move the </p><p>process forward, though completion of an acceptable plan </p><p>probably will not occur before the Fall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>General Comments </p><p>---------------- </p><p>10.  (SBU) Kakhonen said the key is for the GOT to adopt new </p><p>fiscal measures and pass the law on social security </p><p>institutions in the next two weeks, while getting any social </p><p>security rescheduling "right."  He noted that State Minister </p><p>Babacan, while still having limited influence, has been </p><p>playing a positive role.  In addition to telling the cabinet </p><p>the harsh truth about the fiscal situation, he urged the </p><p>Prime Minister and Finance Minister to stop pressuring the </p><p>Central Bank to cut interest rates.  (Note:  When Kakhonen </p><p>expressed concern on this point to Finance Minister Unakitan, </p><p>the Minister picked up the phone and called CB Governor </p><p>Serdengecti to apologize, per Kakhonen.  End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Kakhonen said that the budget financing situation </p><p>looked better now than at the time of the Fourth Review, as </p><p>Treasury has been able to roll over debt well and t-bill </p><p>yields have fallen.  Still, he expressed little optimism that </p><p>Turkey would be able to do more than muddle through in the </p><p>coming months. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
