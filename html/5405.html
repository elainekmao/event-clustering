This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for January 29, 2003.

MEASURES AGAINST A POSSIBLE INFLUX OF REFUGEES </p><p>FROM IRAQ </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Turkey has devised plans to prevent a </p><p>possible influx of refugees from Iraq in the event </p><p>of a possible U.S.-led war in Iraq.  A total of 18 </p><p>centers, including 12 in northern Iraq, will be </p><p>established for the purposes of humanitarian </p><p>assistance for refugees.  In addition, the Sirnak </p><p>Governor\'s Office reportedly continues with measures </p><p>against a possible wave of refugees, as well. </p><p>Survey teams have begun to hammer stakes to put up </p><p>tents near the province\'s Habur border gate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  ANTI-WAR PROTESTS CONTINUE </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Malatya chapter of the Labor Party </p><p>(EMEP) organized a January 27 concert entitled </p><p>"Let\'s Praise Peace."  Over 1,000 war opponents, </p><p>mostly youths, attended the concert, during which </p><p>anti-U.S. imperialism and pro-socialism slogans were </p><p>chanted.  Bolge reported continued criticism on the </p><p>part of NGO\'s against a possible U.S.-led war in </p><p>Iraq.  Yakup Sevki Ozturk, President of the Adana </p><p>Young Businessmen\'s Association (AGIAD), emphasized </p><p>"the need to preserve economic and ecologic </p><p>balances." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  TRIAL OF ASSASSINS OF OKKAN CONTINUES IN </p><p>DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Evrensel)  The trial of four suspected assassins of </p><p>former Diyarbakir Security Director Gaffar Okkan </p><p>continued in the Diyarbakir State Security Court. </p><p>The defendants appeared for the trial and denied the </p><p>charges.   The defendants\' attorneys requested that </p><p>their clients and two eyewitnesses who had testified </p><p>against their clients be brought face to face.  The </p><p>court adjourned the trial for missing documents in </p><p>the case file. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  IDIL (SIRNAK) SURROUNDED, 30 PEOPLE ARRESTED </p><p>(Radikal/Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete)  Following a half- </p><p>hour clash between security forces and PKK/KADEK </p><p>members who had opened fire on military and police </p><p>housing in Idil (Sirnak), security forces took </p><p>large-scale security measures, blocking the district </p><p>with armored vehicles.  Security forces raided </p><p>several homes and arrested 30 (32 according to </p><p>Cumhuriyet) people, including HADEP officials. </p><p>Mahmut Akman, ANAP Mayor of the Sirtkoy district, as </p><p>well as his cousin Sahin Akman, were also arrested. </p><p>The Akmans are also village guards.  Sirnak Governor </p><p>Huseyin Baskaya declared that a group of two-three </p><p>(20 according to Cumhuriyet and Sabah) people had </p><p>carried out the attack.  Cumhuriyet cites local </p><p>sources as saying that seven soldiers were wounded </p><p>during the attack. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  SANLIURFA GOVERNOR A TARGET NOW </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  Over the past three years, there have </p><p>efforts to remove Sanliurfa Governor Dilek from </p><p>office for his efforts in fighting against gangs in </p><p>the province, which has made him the target of </p><p>gangs, clans, sects, and even some politicians. </p><p>Former Interior Minister Saadettin Tantan had been </p><p>appointed Dilek, Tantan\'s then secretary general, </p><p>Sanliurfa Governor.  Dilek first became a target </p><p>after the Motherland Party (ANAP) Provincial </p><p>Chairman\'s son was arrested within the framework of </p><p>an operation launched by the Turkish Electricity </p><p>Distribution Corporation (TEDAS) to prevent illegal </p><p>use of electricity in that province.  Dilek also </p><p>drew reactions from Sanliurfa\'s Bucak Clan for </p><p>repossessing State land, and from Nationalist </p><p>Movement Party (MHP) members for preventing them </p><p>from collecting entrance fees to the State Hospital. </p><p>This time, it is an operation license his office </p><p>refused to issue for an illegal gas station.  The </p><p>newspaper says during his tenure, Dilek also </p><p>- Suspended the distribution of weapon licenses; </p><p>- Cracked down on a gang involved in bidding </p><p>tenders; and </p><p>- Investigated irregularities in Irrigation </p><p>Cooperatives. </p><p>Inspectors had been appointed to investigate Dilek\'s </p><p>actions, but they had found him to be in the right. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  BODY OF ANOTHER CRASH VICTIM MISTAKEN FOR </p><p>SOMEONE ELSE\'S </p><p>(Milliyet)  The body of Ahmet Tas, who had died </p><p>during the plane crash in Diyarbakir earlier this </p><p>month, was confused with that of another victim, </p><p>Veysel Uyanik.  Uyanik\'s family had received the </p><p>body and buried it in Batman.  Officials believe </p><p>Uyanik\'s body is in the Diyarbakir State Hospital\'s </p><p>morgue, where at present there are a total of eight </p><p>bodies.  Of these eight bodies, two more have been </p><p>identified, while officials are awaiting the results </p><p>of DNA tests being carried in Istanbul on samples </p><p>taken from the remaining bodies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  DEPUTY MAYOR:  MUNICIPALITY IS BEING MADE A </p><p>TARGET </p><p>(Evrensel)  Meyet Tekin, Deputy Mayor of </p><p>Diyarbakir\'s Yenisehir district, criticized an </p><p>article entitled "Come To Your Senses, Mayor." </p><p>Tekin claimed Mayor Remzi Azizoglu had been targeted </p><p>for his municipal council\'s decision to demolish the </p><p>district\'s "illegally-constructed" Martyrs Monument. </p><p>Tekin said the municipality was only implementing </p><p>laws.  Under the Zoning Law, the allocation of a </p><p>plot of land for such purposes falls within the </p><p>scope of the Yenisehir Municipality\'s </p><p>responsibilities.  "But the Governor\'s Office did </p><p>not get permission (from our municipality) and </p><p>thereby illegally constructed this monument," he </p><p>argued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  EVRENSEL:  NATIONAL EDUCATION MINISTRY IGNORES </p><p>JUDICIARY </p><p>(Evrensel)  The members of the Music Band of the </p><p>State Employees\' Union Confederation (KESK) in </p><p>Diyarbakir had been indicted for "assisting and </p><p>abetting a terror organization (i.e. PKK)" for </p><p>giving a concert during the Egitim-Sen teachers </p><p>union\'s General Congress in Diyarbakir.  The </p><p>National Education Ministry\'s Disciplinary Council </p><p>had removed the teachers from office.  They were </p><p>later acquitted, but have not been reinstated, even </p><p>though they have petitioned the Diyarbakir </p><p>Administrative Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  HAND GRENADE FOUND AT ADANA SCHOOL </p><p>(Turkiye)  Students found a hand grenade in a bag in </p><p>the garden of a primary school that provides </p><p>education for deaf and mute students.  A bomb squad </p><p>arrived and took the grenade to the Security </p><p>Directorate.  The grenade had been manufactured in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p>11.  FORMER VILLAGE GUARD KILLED FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Kulp (Diyarbakir) resident Engin Akdeniz </p><p>killed 43-year-old former village guard Murat Dinar </p><p>for having raped his 13-year-old sister Necla </p><p>Akdeniz.  Upon a decision by the Akdeniz family, </p><p>Necla\'s two cousins had killed her after giving </p><p>birth to a stillborn baby.  The cousins had been </p><p>sentenced to 20 years\' imprisonment each.  Engin, </p><p>Necla\'s elder brother, had later been tasked with </p><p>killing Dinar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  BOMB HOAX IN DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Evrensel)  Someone called Diyarbakir\'s Sur </p><p>Municipality and said that a bomb had been placed in </p><p>the Diyarbakir Metropolitan Municipality\'s new </p><p>office building under construction in the Dagkapi </p><p>district.  The municipality informed the police; a </p><p>bomb squad arrived and examined the area, but found </p><p>nothing suspicious. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  NUMBER OF ADANA STREET CHILDREN DOWN 65% IN </p><p>2002 </p><p>(Bolge)  As a result of successful projects carried </p><p>out by the Adana Security Directorate\'s Juvenile </p><p>Department, the number of children working in the </p><p>streets and involved in crimes has substantially </p><p>dropped.  The number of children working in the </p><p>streets decreased 65%, falling from 1,071 children </p><p>in 2001 to 479 in 2002.  The number of children </p><p>contributing to family budgets by collecting waste </p><p>paper fell from 250 to 182, and glue inhalers from </p><p>43 to 39.  Last year, legal action was taken against </p><p>815 children, with lawsuits opened against 87 </p><p>families.  Also, 16 children were brought under </p><p>official protection, while 21 others were placed in </p><p>Apprenticeship Training Centers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  DEFENDANTS IN "FRAUDULENT VOTER DECLARATIONS" </p><p>CASE ACQUITTED </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Mersin Court of General Criminal </p><p>Jurisdiction acquitted 48 of the 53 defendants, </p><p>including a district headman, of "fraudulent voter </p><p>registry" in Mersin province.  The remaining four </p><p>defendants did not appear for the trial.  The court </p><p>adjourned the trial and decided to write to these </p><p>four defendants telling them to show up for the </p><p>(upcoming) trial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  PULUMUR (TUNCELI) EARTHQUAKE </p><p>(All papers)  According to the Bogazici University </p><p>(Istanbul) Kandilli Observatory, following the </p><p>January 27 earthquake of 6.5 magnitude in Pulumur </p><p>(Tunceli), 269 aftershocks shook the area on January </p><p>28.  Primary and secondary schools began the two- </p><p>week break a week earlier than normal in the 8,000- </p><p>person district.  As temperatures fell below minus </p><p>20 degrees centigrade, Pulumur residents spent the </p><p>night in one-story buildings and coal cellars, </p><p>instead of "summer" tents provided by the Red </p><p>Crescent Society.  Tunceli Governor Mustafa Erkal </p><p>announced having spoken to Public Works and Housing </p><p>Minister Zeki Ergezen, who he said would send pre- </p><p>fab dwellings.  Erkal added cold-climate tents were </p><p>on the way to replace the summer tents.  "Seven </p><p>damage assessment teams have already been dispatched </p><p>to the region," he continued.  Mayor Mesut Coskun </p><p>said 40 pre-fab dwellings would be placed in a tent </p><p>city established in the Meydanlar district, and that </p><p>200 winter tents had arrived.  Pulumur district </p><p>Governor Ali Ada noted that there were no buildings </p><p>with strong damage in central Pulumur.  He added </p><p>that many buildings had been damaged moderately and </p><p>lightly.  The district Governor\'s Office established </p><p>two soup kitchens and donated TL 150 billion </p><p>(approx. USD 90,000).  The Ministry of Public Works </p><p>donated another TL 50 billion (approx. USD 30,000). </p><p>Turkiye quoted Assistant Professor Zulfu Gurocak of </p><p>Firat University\'s (Elazig) Faculty of Geology </p><p>Engineering as denying reports that Elazig\'s Keban </p><p>Dam was at risk.  According to Gurocak, the North </p><p>Anatolian Fault Line is far away from the dam. </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  SANKO WILL SELL FABRIC TO LEVI\'S </p><p>(Radikal/Turkiye)  Abdulkadir Konukoglu, President </p><p>of the Gaziantep-based Sanko Holding Company, </p><p>announced having signed an agreement to sell fabric </p><p>to Levi\'s, a major producer of jeans.  "We will </p><p>export USD 50 million per year of fabric to Levi\'s," </p><p>he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  COMMERCIAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY FOR ADANA </p><p>BUSINESSMEN </p><p>(Bolge)  The Adana Chamber of Commerce (ACOC) signed </p><p>a protocol agreement with Garanti Bank to provide </p><p>ACOC members with commercial credits for new </p><p>investments or renewal of current ones.  ACOC </p><p>President Saban Bas said the purpose was to assist </p><p>small- and medium-scale industries (KOBI), the </p><p>locomotive of the national economy, and reenergize </p><p>the provincial economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  CUKOBIRLIK MANAGIND DIRECTOR REPLACED </p><p>(Bolge)  AK Party has apparently expedited political </p><p>appointments in Adana after it came to power.  Yakup </p><p>Sahin, Managing Director of Adana\'s Agricultural </p><p>Complex (Cukobirlik), which was in the hands of the </p><p>Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) during the former </p><p>Ecevit government, was removed from office. </p><p>Associate Professor Azim Ozturk of Cukurova </p><p>University (Adana) has been appointed the new </p><p>Managing Director. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
