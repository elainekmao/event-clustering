STABILITY, AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>LOCAL ECONOMIC PROSPECTS, HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL ISSUES, AND </p><p>EVEN AGENT ORANGE ARE AMONG THIS YEAR\'S CONCERNS.  ALL THOSE </p><p>UNDER DETENTION, EVEN BEFORE HAVING HAD A COURT HEARING OR </p><p>SENTENCE, ARE BARRED FROM VOTING, ALONG WITH ALL IN PRISON </p><p>AND OTHERS WHO HAVE "LOST THEIR POLITICAL RIGHTS."

(U)  POL/C AND FSN VISITED NAM DINH AND THAI BINH </p><p>PROVINCES, SOUTHEAST OF HANOI, MAY 7-8 TO OBSERVE ONGOING </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CAMPAIGNS AND PREPARATIONS, AND TO MEET </p><p>WITH PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS.  DESPITE THE </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE MFA, SIMILAR REQUESTS BY POLOFFS FOR </p><p>PROVINCIAL VISITS WERE DENIED BY PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS IN BAC </p><p>KAN AND THAI NGUYEN PROVINCES, CLAIMING THEY WERE "TOO BUSY" </p><p>WITH ELECTION PREPARATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ON THE ELECTION TRAIL </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  OUR VISIT COINCIDED WITH A WEEK OF STAGED CAMPAIGN </p><p>RALLIES OFFERING A CHANCE FOR DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE </p><p>CANDIDATES AND AT LEAST SELECTED VOTERS.  NAM DINH ELECTION </p><p>OFFICIALS SAID THAT THE PROVINCE\'S 16 CANDIDATES (THREE OF </p><p>THEM APPOINTED BY CENTRAL AUTHORITIES) WOULD SPEND MAY 6-10 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01199  01 OF 03  140856Z </p><p>IN THE PROVINCE APPEARING AT LEAST ONCE AT A RALLY IN EACH </p><p>OF THE FIVE CONSTITUENCIES (EACH OF WHICH COVERS TWO </p><p>DISTRICTS).  A RALLY IN NAM DINH TOWN ON THE MORNING OF OUR </p><p>VISIT REPORTEDLY ATTRACTED 200 VOTERS; THE QUESTION AND </p><p>ANSWER PERIOD ELICITED INQUIRIES ON THE CANDIDATES\' PROGRAMS </p><p>ON PROMOTION OF LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, HEALTH CARE </p><p>PROVISION FOR THE ELDERLY, AND EMPLOYMENT GENERATION.  EACH </p><p>OF THE CANDIDATES HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HIS "PROGRAM </p><p>OF ACTION," WHICH WILL ALSO BE POSTED AT THE EACH VOTING </p><p>STATION IN THAT CONSTITUENCY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) ELECTION OFFICIALS AT NAM DINH\'S CONSTITUENCY #2 </p><p>SAID THAT ABOUT 140 PEOPLE HAD ATTENDED A MAY 7 MORNING </p><p>RALLY THERE.  THE PRIMARY FOCI OF QUESTIONING WERE ON PLANS </p><p>TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND EXPAND EDUCATIONAL </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES.  THE THREE HOUR SESSION DEVOTED ABOUT HALF OF </p><p>ITS TIME TO Q&A; LOCAL OFFICIALS CLAIMED THAT VOTERS WERE </p><p>"VERY INTERESTED" IN THE CAMPAIGN THIS YEAR, MUCH MORE SO </p><p>THAN IN THE PREVIOUS NA ELECTIONS IN 1997. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THAI BINH CANDIDATES WERE HOLDING A PARALLEL SET OF </p><p>RALLIES MAY 8-15.  ACCORDING TO THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE VICE CHAIRMAN, THE PRIMARY CONCERN OF VOTERS IS ON </p><p>"STABILITY," WITHOUT WHICH NEITHER FAMILY NOR NATIONAL LIFE </p><p>CAN PROGRESS.  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WAS A SECONDARY CONCERN, </p><p>CLEARLY DEPENDENT ON STABILITY, HE STRESSED.  OTHER PRIMARY </p><p>CONCERNS OF THE VOTERS IN THIS YEAR\'S ELECTIONS ARE ON </p><p>POVERTY REDUCTION, HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN, COMBATING </p><p>NARCOTICS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.  THE SECRETARY OF </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL ELECTION COMMITTEE SEPARATELY HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>"STABLE POLITICS" AS A MAIN CONCERN AMONG VOTERS, ALONG WITH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01199  01 OF 03  140856Z </p><p>LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SECURITY, AND "CULTURE AND </p><p>EDUCATION."  AN ELECTION OFFICIAL IN THAI BINH\'S </p><p>CONSTITUENCY #3 CLAIMED THAT VOTERS HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF AGENT ORANGE AND WHAT MORE COULD BE </p><p>DONE TO HELP ITS VICTIMS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  OFFICIALS IN BOTH PROVINCES ADMITTED IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>QUESTIONS THAT MANY, IF NOT MOST, OF THOSE WHO ATTENDED THE </p><p>CAMPAIGN RALLIES WERE INVITED AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE </p><p>VARIOUS MASS ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE VIETNAM FATHERLAND </p><p>FRONT (WOMEN, YOUTH, VETERANS, FARMERS, ETC.).  OFFICIALS </p><p>UNIFORMLY STRESSED, HOWEVER, THAT ALL RALLIES WERE "OPEN TO </p><p>THE PUBLIC" AND WERE PUBLICIZED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA AS WELL </p><p>AS AT THE VARIOUS VOTING STATIONS.  THEY CLAIMED THAT ALL </p><p>AGENCIES WERE "REQUIRED" TO RELEASE ANY VOTERS FROM WORK IN </p><p>ORDER TO ATTEND THESE MEETINGS, BUT DID NOT EXPLAIN HOW THIS </p><p>WOULD APPLY TO DAY LABORERS OR PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES. </p><p>(NOTE:  HANOI ELECTION COMMITTEE OFFICIALS FAILED TO RESPOND </p><p>EVEN TO OUR REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION AND </p><p>TIMING OF CAMPAIGN RALLIES IN THE CAPITAL, IN PARTICULAR </p><p>THOSE INVOLVING COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC </p><p>MANH -- A CANDIDATE IN CONSTITUENCY #1 --  MUCH LESS OUR </p><p>REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO OBSERVE AT LEAST ONE SUCH RALLY. </p><p>END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3989 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01199  02 OF 03  140857Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PER-00   PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------AE19E3  140857Z /38 </p><p>R 140846Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6437 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 001199 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>7.  (U)  POLOFFS VIEWED THE MAY 7 PRIME TIME TELEVISION </p><p>COVERAGE IN THAI BINH OFFERING RESUMES OF THE VARIOUS </p><p>CANDIDATES AND A SHORT ADDRESS BY ONE CANDIDATE (APPARENTLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01199  02 OF 03  140857Z </p><p>ONE PER EVENING).  CANDIDATES ARE ALSO FREE TO GO STUMPING </p><p>ON THEIR OWN, BUT OFFICIALS ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS NOT A </p><p>USUAL PRACTICE, AND NOTED THAT THERE WAS NO BUDGET FOR SUCH </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>WHO CAN AND CAN\'T VOTE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  THE LOCAL AND PROVINCIAL ELECTION COMMITTEES, SET </p><p>UP USING BUDGETS PROVIDED BY THE NA, HAVE THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES TO "PROPAGANDIZE" ABOUT ELECTION PROCEDURES </p><p>AND ABOUT THE "RIGHT AND DUTY" OF ALL VOTERS TO VOTE, AS </p><p>WELL AS TO PREPARE THE ELECTORAL ROLLS AND THE SPECIAL VOTER </p><p>IDS THAT ALL VOTERS MUST TAKE TO THE VOTING STATION ON MAY </p><p>19.  VOTERS MUST HAVE BEEN BORN ON OR BEFORE MAY 18, 1984. </p><p>EACH CONSTITUENCY IS DIVIDED INTO VOTING UNITS OF BETWEEN </p><p>300-1000 VOTERS, SOMETIMES REPRESENTING A SINGLE VILLAGE OR </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD.  OFFICIALS STRESSED THAT, IN THIS WAY, EACH </p><p>POTENTIAL VOTER WAS IN FACT PERSONALLY KNOWN TO OFFICIALS, </p><p>OBVIATING THE POSSIBILITY OF VOTER FRAUD. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  ELECTION LAW PROHIBITS CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE </p><p>FROM VOTING, MOST NOTABLY THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED.  ABOUT </p><p>3,000 OF NAM DINH\'S 1.16 MILLION VOTERS ARE BARRED ON THESE </p><p>GROUNDS;  IN PRINCIPLE, LOCAL HEALTH WORKERS MUST PROVIDE A </p><p>NEGATIVE CERTIFICATE TO THE LOCAL ELECTION COMMITTEE.  (667 </p><p>OF NAM DINH\'S CONSTITUENCY #2\'S 230,000 VOTERS ARE </p><p>INELIGIBLE ON THESE GROUNDS.)  IN THAI BINH, THERE ARE MORE </p><p>THAN 4,500 PEOPLE INELIGIBLE AMONG THE 1.2 MILLION VOTERS, </p><p>PRIMARILY ON THIS GROUND.  (791 OUT OF 244,000 VOTERS IN </p><p>THAI BINH\'S CONSTITUENCY #3 WERE MENTALLY CHALLENGED AND NOT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01199  02 OF 03  140857Z </p><p>ON THE VOTER ROLLS.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  IN ADDITION, OFFICIALS CONFIRMED THAT ANYONE UNDER </p><p>DETENTION -- EVEN BEFORE TRIAL OR SENTENCE -- AUTOMATICALLY </p><p>LOSES HIS RIGHT TO VOTE.  ALL PRISONERS IN PROVINCIAL AND </p><p>LOCAL PRISONS ARE EQUALLY BARRED FROM VOTING, AS ARE CERTAIN </p><p>OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE LOST THEIR "POLITICAL RIGHTS" </p><p>AS A RESULT OF AN EARLIER SENTENCE OR TRIAL.  PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY OFFICIALS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A LIST OF THESE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS TO LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS.  NAM DINH </p><p>PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS DID NOT PROVIDE OVERALL STATISTICS ON </p><p>THESE POPULATIONS, BUT IN ITS CONSTITUENCY #2, THERE ARE 24 </p><p>PEOPLE UNDER TEMPORARY DETENTION AND 68 PRISONERS WHO WILL </p><p>NOT BE VOTING THIS YEAR.  IN THAI BINH\'S CONSTITUENCY #3, </p><p>361 PEOPLE ARE SIMILARLY BARRED ON THESE GROUNDS, INCLUDING </p><p>BOTH THOSE IN TEMPORARY DETENTION AND IN PRISON. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  IN CONTRAST, SOLDIERS STATIONED IN THESE PROVINCES </p><p>VOTE LOCALLY RATHER THAN IN THEIR HOME DISTRICTS, ACCORDING </p><p>TO OFFICIALS.  THIS IS IN LINE WITH STANDARD PRACTICE </p><p>(DESCRIBED IN REF B) OF VOTERS CASTING BALLOTS IN THE </p><p>CONSTITUENCY WHERE THEY ARE PHYSICALLY PRESENT ON MAY 19, </p><p>USUALLY USING A "LETTER OF INTRODUCTION" ISSUED BY THEIR </p><p>HOME DISTRICT OFFICIALS, RATHER THAN BEING ABLE TO VOTE AT </p><p>HOME VIA ABSENTEE BALLOT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  ILLITERATES -- WHO ARE NOT NUMEROUS GIVEN </p><p>GENERALLY WIDESPREAD EDUCATION AT LEAST A PRIMARY AND JUNIOR </p><p>HIGH SCHOOL LEVELS, OFFICIALS SAID -- MAY VOTE, WITH </p><p>ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01199  02 OF 03  140857Z </p><p>VOTER TURN-OUT EXPECTED TO BE NEAR-UNIVERSAL </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  OFFICIALS CONSISTENTLY PREDICTED TURN-OUT RATES OF </p><p>WELL OVER 90 PCT OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS -- EXCLUDING THOSE </p><p>CATEGORIES DESCRIBED ABOVE -- AT THIS YEAR\'S ELECTION.  THAI </p><p>BINH OFFICIALS SAID THAT THEIR 1997 TURN-OUT RATE FOR THE NA </p><p>ELECTION HAD BEEN 97.8 PCT; THIS YEAR MIGHT BE HIGHER, THEY </p><p>OPINED, SINCE THE MAY DATE WAS MORE CONVENIENT THAN THE </p><p>PREVIOUS ELECTION DURING THE RAINY SEASON.  OFFICIALS AT </p><p>LOCAL POLLING STATIONS DESCRIBED HOW THEY WOULD LITERALLY GO </p><p>DOOR-TO-DOOR IF NECESSARY TO "CONVINCE" -- NOT "FORCE" -- </p><p>VOTERS TO TURN UP.  IF NEED BE, I.E., FOR THE SICK AND </p><p>ELDERLY, THEY WILL TAKE A VOTING BOX TO THE HOME OR </p><p>HOSPITAL. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  MANY LOCAL VOTERS WITH WHOM POL/C SPOKE PRIVATELY </p><p>INDICATED THAT THEY DEFINITELY PLANNED ON VOTING, IF FOR NO </p><p>OTHER REASON THAN THEY DID NOT WANT ANY "TROUBLE" WITH LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES, WHO WERE INTENT ON A HIGH TURN-OUT.  WHILE SUCH </p><p>A PRACTICE IS PROHIBITED BY LAW, SOME INDICATED THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD ASK A PARENT OR NEIGHBOR TO CAST BALLOTS ON THEIR </p><p>BEHALF; OFFICIALS ROUTINELY TURN A BLIND EYE TO SUCH </p><p>PRACTICES, THEY CLAIMED.  (NOTE:  A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>OFFICIAL SEPARATELY INFORMED POLOFFS THAT SUCH "PROXY" </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3990 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01199  03 OF 03  140857Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PER-00   PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------AE19E9  140857Z /38 </p><p>R 140846Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6438 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 HANOI 001199 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>VOTING HAD NEVER BEEN "DOCUMENTED," BUT IMPLIED THAT IT WAS </p><p>A COMMON PRACTICE.

(U)  ELECTION OFFICIALS VARIOUSLY STRESSED HOW THE 2001 </p><p>CHANGES IN THE ELECTION LAW HAD ADDED THE REQUIREMENT THAT </p><p>ALL CANDIDATES BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE "DEMOCRATIC" </p><p>SOCIETY, AND HOW THIS HAD WEIGHED HEAVILY AGAINST SOME </p><p>POTENTIAL CANDIDATES IN THE LENGTHY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS </p><p>(REF B).  SOME OFFICIALS EXPLAINED THE FACT THAT THERE WERE </p><p>NOT MORE CANDIDATES TO DIFFICULTY IN MEETING THIS CRITERION </p><p>(AS WELL AS THE OTHERS) AT NEIGHBORHOOD/WORK PLACE MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, ALL CANDIDATES WERE </p><p>REQUIRED TO FILL OUT A RUDIMENTARY ASSETS DECLARATION, </p><p>FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON PERSONAL POSSESSION OF FAMILY HOUSES, </p><p>LAND, AND VEHICLES.  NAM DINH OFFICIALS SAID THAT THESE </p><p>DECLARATIONS WERE PART OF THE CANDIDATES FILES HELD BY THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL VFF; IF VOTERS WISHED TO EXAMINE THE DOCUMENTS, </p><p>THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE PROVINCIAL VFF OFFICE.  THAI </p><p>BINH OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, PLEDGED THAT THESE DECLARATIONS </p><p>WOULD BE POSTED AT ALL VOTING STATIONS.  WHEN POLOFFS </p><p>VISITED ITS CONSTITUENCY #3, THE DECLARATIONS WERE INDEED </p><p>POSTED AND WE WERE ABLE TO VIEW COPIES.  NONE OF THE </p><p>CANDIDATES REPORTED ANY ASSETS IN ANY BANK, AND THE THREE </p><p>CANDIDATES\' SOLE ASSETS APPEARED TO BE PRIVATE HOUSING </p><p>(APARTMENT OR HOUSE). </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01199  03 OF 03  140857Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17.
