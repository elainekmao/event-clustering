OTHER COMMENTATORS WARNED THAT </p><p>DESPITE IRAQ\'S ACCEPTANCE OF UN DEMANDS, U.S. </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR AN "AGGRESSION" AGAINST IT WILL </p><p>CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWS REPORTS </p><p> </p><p>JORDANIAN DAILIES ON ALL LED WITH REPORTS ON THE </p><p>BOMBINGS IN NETANYA AND GAZA.  THE HEADLINES DESCRIBED </p><p>THE BOMBINGS AS "OPERATIONS" OR "COMMANDO OPERATIONS," </p><p>WHILE INDEPENDENT, MASS-APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL- </p><p>YAWM SAID: "HAMAS STRIKES AGAIN IN NETANYA." </p><p> </p><p>DAILIES ALSO GAVE PROMINENT COVERAGE TO PRIME MINISTER </p><p>ALI ABUL RAGHEB\'S VISIT TO RAMALLAH, WITH HEADLINES </p><p>HIGHLIGHTING JORDAN\'S SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>REFORMS AND THE QUEST TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>STATE. </p><p> </p><p>JORDANIAN DAILIES ALSO REPORTED ON THEIR FRONT PAGES VP </p><p>CHENEY\'S INTERVIEW WITH FOX NEWS, HIGHLIGHTING TWO </p><p>ELEMENTS: HIS ASSERTION THAT THE RETURN OF THE WEAPONS </p><p>INSPECTORS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM WITH IRAQ, </p><p>AND HIS WARNING OF MORE "ATTACKS AGAINST THE U.S." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p> </p><p>-- THE BATTLE OF PALESTINIAN REFORMS </p><p>IMPORTANT DAILY COLUMNIST BASSEM SAKEJHA WROTE IN </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON MAY </p><p>20: "CORRUPTION IN THE PNA IS NOT A SECRET, AND WHEN </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS ELECTED THE PALESTINIAN NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY, THEY DID NOT DO SO IN PERPETUITY.  BUT </p><p>QUESTIONS OF REFORM ARE NOW RAISED NOT FROM WITHIN, BUT </p><p>BY THE ENEMY AND HIS ALLY, AS IF THE BATTLE WERE NOT </p><p>ABOUT THE CHURCH OF NATIVITY AND JENIN, BUT ABOUT THE </p><p>DATE OF ELECTIONS AND THE SIZE OF THE CABINET.  THE </p><p>PROBLEM IS THAT THE PALESTINIAN PRESIDENCY CONSIDERS </p><p>THE TIMING OF THE ELECTIONS TO BE A CARD TO PRESSURE </p><p>THE ISRAELIS AND AMERICANS, NOT A PROCESS OF REAL </p><p>REFORM.  WE ALL KNOW THAT THE AMERICAN TALK ABOUT </p><p>REFORM IS IN BAD FAITH, BUT THIS DOES NOT JUSTIFY </p><p>DELAYING THIS STEP, WHICH WOULD BE THE FIRST IN </p><p>BUILDING A DEMOCRATIC STATE. TEL AVIV AND WASHINGTON </p><p>WANT THEM AS A WAY OF BRINGING IN A PALESTINIAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP THAT WOULD BE LAX REGARDING PALESTINIAN </p><p>NATIONAL ISSUES, BUT EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THEY </p><p>WILL NOT SUCCEED BECAUSE THE PALESTINIAN STREET ALWAYS </p><p>HAS THE MEANS TO CORRECT POLITICAL ORIENTATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>-- THEY CALL FOR LIBERATING ANDALUSIA </p><p>TAHER AL-ADWAN, CHIEF EDITOR OF INDEPENDENT, MASS- </p><p>APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM WROTE ON MAY 20: </p><p>"MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE SHARON UNLEASHED HIS </p><p>TROOPS TO REOCCUPY THE LIBERATED PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES AND REACHED THE DOORS OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>OFFICE, WITH UNPRECEDENTED AMERICAN SUPPORT.  NOW THE </p><p>TALK IS ABOUT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT, AND HIS PALESTINIAN CRITICS JUSTIFY </p><p>THEMSELVES BY CLAIMING THAT THEY MAKE CALLS FOR REFORM. </p><p>BUT EVERYONE REMEMBERS THAT THE ORIGIN OF THESE CALLS </p><p>WERE PRESIDENT BUSH AND GENERAL SHARON, AND THEIR CALL </p><p>FOR `REFORM\' IS TO COMPLETE THE PRESSURE THAT THE </p><p>MILITARY OPERATION STARTED.  ARAFAT NOW RESISTS </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE HIM AND THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>AUTHORITY. HIS CRITICS, THEREFORE, ARE LIKE THOSE WHO </p><p>TOLL THE BELLS CALLING FOR PRAYER WHILE THE ENEMY </p><p>TROOPS SCALE THE WALLS OF THEIR CITY.  WE FIND </p><p>OURSELVES LOOKING AT A CARICATURE BEST DESCRIBED BY </p><p>PALESTINIAN POET MAHMOUD DARWISH IN A FAMOUS POEM, IN </p><p>WHICH HE SAID: `THEY CALL FOR LIBERATING ANDALUSIA WHEN </p><p>ALEPPO IS UNDER SIEGE.\'" </p><p> </p><p>-- LOOKING FOR PRETEXTS </p><p>"FORMER UNDER-SECRETARY OF CULTURE MOHAMMAD NAJI </p><p>AMAYREH  WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC </p><p>DAILY AL-RAI ON MAY 20: "AMERICAN THREATS OF A MILITARY </p><p>STRIKE AGAINST IRAQ HAVE NOT CEASED ALTHOUGH IRAQ HAS </p><p>ACCEPTED THE NEW SANCTIONS REGIME AND IT DID NOT OPPOSE </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE INSPECTORS, WHILE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO </p><p>PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING SPIES FOR THE U.S.  THE U.S. </p><p>AND ITS ALLY BRITAIN ARE NOW LOOKING FOR PRETEXTS FOR </p><p>THIS AGGRESSION, AND THEY WILL PROBABLY FIND SOME, </p><p>BECAUSE PREPARATIONS FOR THE AGGRESSION ONLY WAIT FOR A </p><p>MORE APPROPRIATE MOMENT TO LAUNCH IT.  THIS HESITATION </p><p>DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY HAVE RULED OUT MILITARY ACTION. </p><p>HOWEVER, AMERICA WILL FAIL TO ACHIEVE ITS AIMS FROM </p><p>THIS STRIKE, WHICH WILL ONLY WEAKEN U.S. SUPPORTERS IN </p><p>THE ARAB WORLD AND STRENGTHEN THOSE WHO CALL FOR </p><p>SEARCHING FOR ALTERNATIVE FRIENDS."
