<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000925 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AFRICAN PRESIDENTIAL VISIT NEXT WEEK - MASS ACTION </p><p>DELAYED TWO WEEKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Plans for a Tsvangirai visit to Malawi have been </p><p>scrapped in favor of Malawian President Muluzi and South </p><p>African president Mbeki coming to Harare next week for talks </p><p>with the MDC.  The MDC planned stayaway has also been delayed </p><p>for another two weeks.  Switching the presidential meeting to </p><p>Harare was reportedly due to Mugabe\'s fear that Tsvangirai </p><p>might also travel to South Africa on an invitation from </p><p>Mbeki.  Regardless, Mugabe is likely to lose comparatively </p><p>from the upcoming talks because the MDC is being recognized </p><p>regionally as an essential negotiator for Zimbabwe\'s future. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Malawi Meeting Switched to Harare </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to the special assistant to the MDC </p><p>President, Gandi Mudzingwa, plans for a meeting in Malawi </p><p>between MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai and President Muluzi, </p><p>had been scrapped in favor of a meeting in Harare with Muluzi </p><p>and Mbeki sometime in the week of May 19 - 23.  Mudzingwa had </p><p>been communicating with the Malawian High Commissioner in </p><p>Harare on the planning and travel documents for the trip.  On </p><p>May 11, the High Commissioner said that President Mugabe was </p><p>afraid that Mbeki might also invite Tsvangirai to meetings in </p><p>South Africa during Tsvangirai\'s trip. </p><p> </p><p>MDC to Gain Regardless </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Mudzingwa said that while meetings in Malawi might </p><p>have been more desirable, the MDC is still gaining ground </p><p>with the current plan: regional leaders are recognizing the </p><p>MDC as a legitimate representative of the Zimbabwean people, </p><p>and a key player in negotiations on Zimbabwe\'s future; and </p><p>the meetings will reaffirm the MDC as a willing negotiating </p><p>partner, and most likely, the GOZ as obstructionist. </p><p>Mudzingwa said there was nothing specific yet on an agenda; </p><p>however, it seems clear from Mbeki\'s recommendation that the </p><p>MDC recognize Mugabe as the de facto President of Zimbabwe </p><p>that Mbeki would like to get the inter-party dialogue started </p><p>again. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Might Consider Recognition with Exit Plan </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Mudzingwa said they might consider such recognition if </p><p>there was a quid pro quo guarantee of Mugabe\'s exit. </p><p>Mudzingwa understood that the moment may be ripe to restart </p><p>negotiations.  Mbeki\'s interest was due to the June 1-3 G8 </p><p>Summit in Evian where Mbeki will want to demonstrate a track </p><p>record for African peer review in the context of a funding </p><p>appeal for NEPAD.  Mudzingwa was receptive to the suggestion </p><p>that the MDC needed to find a formulation for language on </p><p>Mugabe\'s status that did not constitute an agreement to </p><p>preconditions. </p><p> </p><p>Preparing for Mass Action </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Mudzingwa said there was no specific plan to make the </p><p>mass action coincide with the meetings; however, that might </p><p>happen coincidentally.  Mudzingwa said it had not been </p><p>determined what form the mass action would take, that it </p><p>would probably start as a stayaway, and potentially move into </p><p>demonstrations, marches, or even a march on State House. </p><p>Mudzingwa said that many MDC activists at the grass roots </p><p>level would like to organize an ocean of people to march on </p><p>State House and force Mugabe to abdicate, but the MDC </p><p>leadership was not convinced this was possible. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Mudzingwa said the success of the mass action was </p><p>contingent on the Zimbabwe Defense Forces\' (ZDF) response. </p><p>As long as the ZDF did not beat up or shoot MDC supporters, </p><p>the mass action could continue and gain strength.  Mudzingwa </p><p>said that the MDC had consulted discreetly with the Zimbabwe </p><p>Republic Police (ZRP) and did not foresee a significant </p><p>crackdown from them, or for that matter, the disorganized </p><p>youth militia.  If a crackdown were severe, it would then </p><p>take them more time to build confidence and organize further </p><p>mass actions. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Mugabe\'s reluctance to accept regional recognition for </p><p>the MDC would explain his insistence that the presidential </p><p>meetings be held in Harare.  We would expect Mugabe to </p><p>thereby try and retain control of the event.  However, we </p><p>tend to agree with the MDC\'s assessment that overall he is </p><p>likely to lose from the upcoming round whichever way it goes. </p><p> The bottom line is that the MDC is increasingly being </p><p>recognized regionally as a key negotiator for Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>future.  End Comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
