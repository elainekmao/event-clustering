(SBU)  SUMMARY:  ON JUNE 14, KICKING OFF A SERIES OF </p><p>DONOR-GOVERNMENT CONSULTATIONS, UNDP SPONSORED A `HIGH- </p><p>LEVEL\' CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS ONE OF THE CENTRAL DOCUMENTS </p><p>APPROVED BY VIETNAM\'S COMMUNIST PARTY DURING THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS CONCLUDED IN APRIL.  THE DOCUMENT, `THE 10 YEAR </p><p>SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY\', IN MANY WAYS MORE A </p><p>POLITICAL STATEMENT THAN A MODERN ECONOMIC STRATEGY, </p><p>NONETHELESS HELPS SET THE STAGE FOR THE COMING PERIOD. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, WHILE IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR - BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN-INVESTED - IT ALSO </p><p>PANDERS TO THE STATE SECTOR.  THE PAPER RATHER PERFUNCTORILY </p><p>NOTES THE MANY COMMITMENTS TO INTERNATIONAL INTEGRATION THE </p><p>GVN HAS IN RECENT YEARS SIGNED ONTO, INCLUDING AFTA AND THE </p><p>U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT.  IT ALSO MENTIONS </p><p>THE GOAL OF `EVENTUAL\' ACCESSION TO THE WTO.  DONORS </p><p>APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE DOCUMENT AND </p><p>PROVIDE THE GOVERNMENT WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR CARRYING OUT THE </p><p>MEANINGFUL ELEMENTS OF THE STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY CONT\'D: AMBASSADOR PETERSON CRITICIZED THE </p><p>VESTIGIAL PLANNING NATURE INHERENT IN THE DOCUMENT AND </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN JOB </p><p>CREATION.

HIS COMMENTS TURNED THE STAID CONFERENCE INTO A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DEBATE REGARDING VIETNAM\'S FUTURE.  OTHER </p><p>COMMENTS INCLUDED A SURPRISE INTERVENTION BY THE CHINESE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ABOUT THE NEED FOR GREATER COMPETITION IN THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE ECONOMY, INCLUDING ROBUST PARTICIPATION OF THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS.  SEVERAL DONORS </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR DEVELOPING DEEPER LEGAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY AND PROCESS IN </p><p>DEVELOPING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS THE PERVASIVE </p><p>NEED FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM.  THE U.S. DELEGATION </p><p>ALSO UNDERSCORED THE TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN </p><p>THE U.S.-VIETNAM BTA (NOW BEFORE CONGRESS) AND URGED </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS WHERE LAWS EXISTED AS IN THE AREA OF </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION.  THE UNDP LEGAL </p><p>REFORM ADVISER SUGGESTED THE GVN CONSIDER AMENDING ITS </p><p>CONSTITUTION TO CREATE A `PROFESSIONAL\' NATIONAL LEGISLATURE </p><p>IN VIEW OF VIETNAM\'S NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND QUALITY </p><p>OF NATIONAL LAWS IN COMING YEARS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) IN AN `OFF-THE-RECORD\' MEETING ON JUNE 14, DONORS </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT MET IN HANOI TO DISCUSS VIETNAM\'S 10 YEAR </p><p>SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (2001-2010), THE FIVE- </p><p>YEAR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN (2001-2005), AND A </p><p>STRATEGY FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM FOR THE PERIOD </p><p>2001-2010.  (COPIES OF THESE DOCUMENTS WILL BE POUCHED TO </p><p>EAP/BCLTV.)  FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG AND </p><p>MINISTER OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT TRAN XUAN GIA CHAIRED </p><p>THE SESSIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND MANY OTHER SENIOR </p><p>VIETNAMESE ECONOMIC OFFICIALS ALSO PARTICIPATED. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01497  01 OF 03  220450Z </p><p>AMBASSADORS OF DONOR COUNTRIES AND RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>OF IFI\'S WERE INVITED TO THIS `HIGH-LEVEL\' EVENT.
