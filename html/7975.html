(U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE RICHARD A. ALBRIGHT </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  The sensitivity of reftel demarche, </p><p>particularly the involvement of the prominent </p><p>Lootah family (whether knowingly or otherwise) in </p><p>the matter, will require that we engage at the </p><p>highest levels of the UAEG.  Since this is </p><p>primarily a government-to-government issue, we </p><p>will seek an appointment with de facto Foreign </p><p>Minister Hamdan bin Zayid (our primary federal </p><p>contact on policy-level terrorist financing </p><p>matters), but can anticipate that he will have </p><p>several questions which we would like to be able </p><p>to answer.  We would note that a direct USG to </p><p>Dubai Emirate communication on this matter would </p><p>not/not be recommended absent prior notification </p><p>to, and approval of, the federal authorities in </p><p>Abu Dhabi. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  First and foremost, what are the </p><p>intentions of the USG with regards to the funds? </p><p>Will we seek their forfeiture to us and if so, </p><p>will we be able to "vest" them to ensure that </p><p>these monies are returned to the Iraqi people (as </p><p>opposed to the general treasury of the USG)?  What </p><p>would be the modalities through which we would </p><p>take this legal action and communicate it to the </p><p>UAEG?  Secondly, are we prepared to agree to hold </p><p>blameless UAE actors or entities whose involvement </p><p>in the matter may be confirmed by the records we </p><p>are seeking to have turned over to us by the UAEG? </p><p>(Note:  This matter has arisen in the past in FBI </p><p>investigations and we have been able to provide </p><p>assurances to the Central Bank of the UAE that it </p><p>was not our intention to pursue UAE financial </p><p>institutions; if we found strong evidence of </p><p>wrongdoing we would provide that information to </p><p>the appropriate UAE authorities for their </p><p>consideration.  We advise that a similar </p><p>undertaking be provided in this matter in order to </p><p>facilitate provision of the documents we desire. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Post would appreciate a quick response to </p><p>the above questions so that we may approach MFA </p><p>Minstate Hamdan at the earliest opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  This message coordinated with Amconsul </p><p>Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
