<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 NIAMEY 04184 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/RA, AF/WF, AND NEA/AFN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PINS, PTER, LY, NG </p><p>SUBJECT:  COUNTERING LIBYAN INFLUENCE IN NIGER </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  STATE 146918 (NOTAL) </p><p>-     B.  STATE 150492 (NOTAL) </p><p>-     C.  BAMAKO 003325 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  DESPITE NUMEROUS EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS BY THIS </p><p>EMBASSY TO COUNTER QADDHAFI\'S INFLUENCE IN NIGER, </p><p>THE LIBYAN PRESENCE HAS STEADILY GROWN.  THE SAIBOU </p><p>REGIME CLINGS DESPERATELY TO ITS "GOOD-NEIGHBOR" </p><p>POLICY, AND FEARS ANTAGONIZING QADDHAFI.  ALSO THE </p><p>NIGERIENS PERCEIVE TANGIBLE BENEFITS FROM THE LIBYAN </p><p>PRESENCE--AND NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.  THEY CANNOT </p><p>FIND A LIBYAN HAND IN LOCAL DISTURBANCES </p><p> </p><p>3.  TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL APPROACH ON LIBYA, WE </p><p>SHOULD LAY DOWN MARKERS WITH THE NEXT GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THE OTHER NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURES IN NIGER, </p><p>INCLUDING PARTIES AND UNIONS, ABOUT LIBYAN </p><p>SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES IN AFRICA.  BRIEFERS SHOULD </p><p>SPEND MORE TIME ON CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF LIBYAN </p><p>SUBVERSION IN AND THROUGH AFRICAN STATES, THAN ON </p><p>MARGINAL ISSUES IN NIGER SUCH AS CW AND PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRORISM.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>LIBYAN INFLUENCE GROWS DESPITE US DEMARCHES </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  COUNTERING LIBYAN INFLUENCE IN NIGER HAS BEEN </p><p>AMONG THIS EMBASSY\'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES FOR YEARS. </p><p>WHILE WE HAVE READY ACCESS TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND HAVE MADE INNUMERABLE DEMARCHES ON </p><p>LIBYA, BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIFIC, WE HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>ABLE TO ARREST THE INEXORABLE GROWTH OF THE LIBYAN </p><p>PRESENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TWO FACTORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO LIBYA\'S </p><p>SUCCESS.  FIRST, THE SAIBOU GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MORE </p><p>INCLINED THAN ITS PREDECESSOR TO PURSUE A </p><p>"GOOD-NEIGHBOR" POLICY TOWARDS QADDHAFI.  THE </p><p>REGIME\'S REASONING IS THAT IT GAINS NOTHING BY </p><p>ANTAGONIZING LIBYA, EXCEPT FOR A GREATER CERTITUDE </p><p>THAT IT WILL ACT AGAINST NIGERIEN INTERESTS.  WITH </p><p>QADDHAFI NEXT DOOR, AND A COMPLETELY OPEN EXPANSE OF </p><p>DESERT FOR A BORDER, LIBYAN "DIRTY TRICKS" IN NIGER </p><p>WOULD BE MERE CHILD\'S PLAY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SECOND, THE EXPANDED LIBYAN PRESENCE IN NIGER </p><p>HAS NOT YET HAD ANY CONCRETE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, </p><p>AND IN FACT HAS PRODUCED A NUMBER OF POSITIVE ONES </p><p>FROM THE NIGERIEN PERSPECTIVE.  FIRST, THE NIGERIENS </p><p>OBSERVE MORE LIBYAN COMMERCIAL UNDERTAKINGS IN THEIR </p><p>COUNTRY, WHICH THEY EQUATE WITH INCOME FOR NIGER, OR </p><p>AT LEAST FOR SOME NIGERIENS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THEY ALSO SEE LIBYAN ASSISTANCE FROM TIME TO </p><p>TIME, WHICH, ALTHOUGH NOT MUCH, IS MORE THAN THEY </p><p>GET FROM ANY OTHER MAGHREB STATE, AS ONE NIGERIEN </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY OFFICIAL HAS POINTED OUT. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE SPREAD OF LIBYAN INFLUENCE IS ALMOST </p><p>CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL BENEFIT </p><p>FOR A NUMBER OF NIGERIEN INDIVIDUALS, THAT PERHAPS </p><p>DOES NOT SHOW UP ON THEIR GROSS INCOME STATEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  FINALLY, DESPITE THE UNQUESTIONED PRESENCE OF </p><p>NIGERIEN DISSIDENTS IN LIBYA OVER THE PAST TEN </p><p>YEARS, ESPECIALLY AMONG TUAREGS, THE GON HAS BEEN </p><p>UNABLE TO COME UP WITH ANY RECENT EVIDENCE OF DIRECT </p><p>LIBYAN ASSISTANCE TO AY DISSIDENT GROUPS IN NIGER. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN OUR VIEW, AS LONG AS THE NIGERIENS LACK </p><p>CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF UNSAVORY LIBYAN ACTIVITIES </p><p>WITHIN THEIR BORDERS, AND AS LONG AS THE LIBYANS </p><p>CONTINUE TO ADD TO THE NATIONAL WEALTH, IT WILL BE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE THE GON TO CLAMP DOWM ON THE </p><p>LIBYAN PRESENCE.  MOREOVER, WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE </p><p>PROLIFERATION OF PARTIES AND AN EVENTUAL CHANGE IN </p><p>REGIME TO CREATE A NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD LIBYA, SINCE </p><p>QADDHAFI IS LIKELY TO BUY INTO RELATIONSHIPS WITH </p><p>THE NEW POLITICAL PARTIES AND POWER CENTERS, IF HE </p><p>HAS NOT ALREADY DONE SO.  WE HAVE VERY LIMITED MEANS </p><p>OF COUNTERING THAT KIND OF EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>NEED TO LAY DOWN MARKERS WITH GON, PARTIES, UNIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH WE CAN TAKE TO </p><p>MINIMIZE LIBYAN INFLUENCE IN NIGER IS TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>LAY DOWN MARKERS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND NOW WITH OTHER POLITICAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS (PARTIES, UNIONS, ETC.) ABOUT LIBYA\'S </p><p>DESTRUCTIVE POLICIES IN AFRICA.  WE SHOULD PROVIDE </p><p>CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF LIBYAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, AS WE HAVE DONE </p><p>HERE IN THE PAST REGARDING BURKINA FASO, CHAD, AND </p><p>BENIN.  MALI IS ANOTHER COUNTRY IN WHICH THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR GROWING LIBYAN INFLUENCE (AS EMBASSY </p><p>BAMAKO HAS ARGUED) IS OF DIRECT SIGNIFICANCE, GIVEN </p><p>THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS IN MALI AND NIGER OF </p><p>RESTIVE TUAREG POPULATIONS AMD POVERTY-STRICKEN, </p><p>NASCENT DEMOCRACIES RIPE FOR LIBYAN EXPLOITATION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>COUNTERING THE "BENEFITS" OF THE LIBYAN PRESENCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>11.  TO COUNTER NIGERIEN PROPENSITY TO SEE THE </p><p>BENEFITS OF THE LIBYAN PRESENCE, WE SHOULD MAKE AN </p><p>EFFORT TO DRAW PARALLELS FOR THE NIGERIENS ABOUT HOW </p><p>CERTAIN LIBYAN ORGANIZATIONS IN NIGER COULD </p><p>POTENTIALLY WORK AGAINST NIGER\'S INTERESTS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE IN OTHER AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  BRIEFERS FROM WASHINGTON COULD BE PARTICULARLY </p><p>HELPFUL IN THESE TASKS, BUT WE SHOULD WAIT AT LEAST </p><p>UNTIL A TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE, IF WE </p><p>EXPECT TO REACH POLICY MAKERS AND OPINION SETTERS.. </p><p>MOREOVER, OUR BRIEFINGS SHOULD NOT DWELL AT LENGTH </p><p>ON LIBYAN CW POLICY, SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRORISM, OR OTHER ISSUES MARGINALLY RELEVANT TO </p><p>NIGER\'S CONCERNS.  WE SHOULD BE AS NIGER-SPECIFIC AS </p><p>POSSIBLE, IF WE WAWT TO HAVE AN EVENTUAL IMPACT. </p><p> </p><p>CUNDIFF </p><p></p></div>
