<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001943 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE\'S CABINET RESHUFFLE REWARDS LOYALTY, NOT </p><p>COMPETENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1872 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In a long-anticipated move, President Mugabe named a </p><p>new Cabinet on August 24 that looks very much like the old </p><p>one, albeit with some portfolios shifted around.    Finance </p><p>Minister Makoni and Health Minister Stamps were the only ones </p><p>dismissed, while two new Ministers (former Ambassador to the </p><p>U.S. and Chief Executive of the Zimbabwe Tourist Authority </p><p>Amos Midzi and former Cabinet member Witness Mangwende) and </p><p>six new deputy ministers were named.  Two new ministries -- </p><p>Energy and Power Development, and Small and Medium </p><p>Enterprises Development -- were created.  Loyalty, not </p><p>competence, appeared to be the primary criterion for the </p><p>personnel moves, as Mugabe and his inner circle hunker down </p><p>in the face of increasing international and domestic </p><p>pressure.  The new Cabinet is composed almost entirely of </p><p>Mugabe sycophants who will continue to lead Zimbabwe in the </p><p>same disastrous policy direction, perhaps with more zeal, and </p><p>even worse results (if the new Finance Minister is not up to </p><p>the task.)  Mugabe\'s failure to appoint two new </p><p>Vice-Presidents, as expected, leaves observers in the dark </p><p>for now about his retirement and succession intentions.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Those who have retained their Cabinet portfolios are </p><p>as follows: </p><p> </p><p>Foreign Affairs:  Stan Mudenge </p><p>Information and Publicity: Jonathan Moyo </p><p>Agriculture, Lands and Resettlement: Joseph Made </p><p>Justice, Legal, and Parliamentary Affairs:  Patrick Chinamasa </p><p>Defense: Sydney Sekeramayi </p><p>Education, Sport, and Culture: Aeneas Chigwedere </p><p>Environment and Tourism: Francis Nhema </p><p>Local Government, Public Works, and National Housing: </p><p>Ignatius Chombo </p><p>Mines and Mining Development: Edward Chindori-Chininga </p><p>Public Service, Labor, and Social Welfare: July Moyo </p><p>Rural Resources and Water Development: Joyce Mujuru </p><p>Youth Development, Gender, and Employment Creation: Elliot </p><p>Manyika </p><p>State Security: Nicholas Goche </p><p> </p><p>The remaining ministerial portfolios were distributed as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>Home Affairs:  Kembo Mohadi (formerly Deputy Minister of </p><p>Local Government) </p><p>Finance:  Herbert Murerwa (formerly Minister of Industry and </p><p>International Trade) </p><p>Transport and Communications: Witness Mangwende </p><p>Health and Child Welfare: David Parirenyatwa (formerly Deputy </p><p>Health Minister) </p><p>Energy and Power Development: Amos Midzi </p><p>Small and Medium Enterprises Development: Sithembiso Nyoni </p><p>(formerly Minister for the Informal Sector) </p><p>Minister of State for State Enterprises and Parastatals: Paul </p><p>Mangwana (formerly Deputy Justice Minister) </p><p>Minister of State for Science and Technology Development: </p><p>Olivia Muchena (formerly Minister of State in VP Msika\'s </p><p>office) </p><p>Minister of State for Land Reform: Flora Bhuka (formerly </p><p>Minister of State in VP Muzenda\'s office) </p><p> </p><p>Six new deputy ministers were appointed: </p><p> </p><p>Industry and International Trade: Kenneth Manyonda </p><p>Mines and Mining Development: Jaison Machaya </p><p>Energy and Power Development: Reuben Marumahoko </p><p>Local Government, Public Works, and National Housing: Chief </p><p>Fortune Charumbira </p><p>Rural Resources and Water Development: Tinos Rusere </p><p>Small and Medium Scale Enterprises: Kenneth Mutiwekuziva </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Brian Raftopoulos, one of Zimbabwe\'s most perceptive </p><p>political analysts, described the reshuffle as a </p><p>"consolidation of Mugabe\'s position."  He said it is clear </p><p>from the personnel moves that Mugabe is "digging in his </p><p>heels" and that we are unlikely to see any drawback from the </p><p>GOZ\'s current policy direction.  Eddison Zvobgo, the </p><p>estranged ZANU-PF politician who was expelled by Mugabe from </p><p>the politburo in 2000 because of his willingness to stand up </p><p>to the Zimbabwean President, described the Cabinet changes in </p><p>less diplomatic terms in a discussion with us.  He claimed </p><p>that every member of the new Cabinet is a "strident yes-man </p><p>or yes-woman" for President Mugabe.  Cabinet and the ZANU-PF </p><p>politburo, he continued, have become mere rubber stamps for </p><p>Mugabe\'s decisions, and not a single member of those bodies </p><p>is prepared to challenge the Zimbabwean President. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  It is clear that political loyalty was the </p><p>prime -- if not exclusive -- criterion in the re-assignment </p><p>of ministerial portfolios.  If competence had been a </p><p>consideration, the hapless Joseph Made, who denied until </p><p>recently the possibility of food shortages in Zimbabwe, would </p><p>have been forced to pack his bags, along with many of his </p><p>colleagues.  The fact that Made and other loyal hardliners </p><p>such as Jonathan Moyo, Patrick Chinamasa, Ignatius Chombo, </p><p>and Elliot Manyika have been asked to stay is a clear </p><p>indication that the GOZ is not about to undertake any major </p><p>policy reversals.  Makoni\'s removal strongly suggests that </p><p>the GOZ has no plans to infuse its economic decision-making </p><p>with any sense of rationality.  In fact, if retread Finance </p><p>Minister Murerwa -- who preceded and now succeeds Makoni in </p><p>this position -- does not hold the line on fiscal restraint </p><p>and permit the cumbersome but still functional parallel </p><p>exchange rate system to continue, the economy could contract </p><p>even more rapidly and hyper-inflation set in.  We interpret </p><p>the reshuffle as a circling of the wagons, as Mugabe hunkers </p><p>down with his most trusted subordinates in the face of </p><p>growing international and domestic pressure.  President </p><p>Mugabe was widely expected to appoint two new Vice-Presidents </p><p>to replace incumbents Simon Muzenda and Joseph Msika.  The </p><p>fact that he did not suggests that Mugabe and his inner </p><p>circle have not yet reached any definitive conclusions about </p><p>the issue of succession.  John Nkomo\'s apparent demotion from </p><p>Home Affairs to a newly-created Minister of State for Special </p><p>Affairs position in the President\'s office, when he was </p><p>widely expected to be named Vice-President, suggests he has </p><p>lost ground in internal succession maneuvering. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment continued:  The timing of the reshuffle </p><p>likely was motivated in part by growing criticism that the </p><p>old Cabinet had no legal standing because its members were </p><p>not re-appointed after the March presidential election. </p><p>According to the Zimbabwean constitution, the offices of </p><p>Vice-President, Minister, and Deputy Minister become vacant </p><p>upon the assumption of office of a new President.  Although </p><p>the question of whether Mugabe was a "new" president appears </p><p>open to interpretation, Mugabe likely wanted to avoid any </p><p>related judicial challenges.  Zvobgo, who is an expert on </p><p>constitutional law, insisted that the old Cabinet should have </p><p>taken new oaths of office after the election, as Mugabe did. </p><p>He informed us that the legal parliamentary committee which </p><p>he chairs had rejected 47 decrees (statutory instruments) </p><p>issued since the election because the ministers who signed </p><p>them had no legal standing, and had vowed to make this an </p><p>issue when parliament resumes sitting in late September. </p><p>Zvobgo surmised that this is what drove Mugabe to reshuffle </p><p>the Cabinet when he did, a move which will give the new </p><p>Ministers sufficient time to re-issue those 47 decrees before </p><p>Parliament reconvenes. </p><p> </p><p>Biographic information </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) Detailed biographic information on all of the new </p><p>Cabinet members will follow septel.  In the meantime, we </p><p>wanted to provide the following brief sketches: </p><p> </p><p>Simba Makoni:  Makoni had been living on borrowed time since </p><p>Mugabe publicly criticized as "saboteurs" and "enemies of the </p><p>state" anyone who advocated devaluation of the Zimbabwean </p><p>dollar, a small camp of which Makoni had been the most vocal </p><p>member.  Since his appointment in 2000, Makoni had been a </p><p>lonely advocate within GOZ circles of rational economic </p><p>decision-making, and Mugabe likely tired of his willingness </p><p>to critcize -- regularly and publicly -- bad government </p><p>decisions. </p><p> </p><p>Kembo Mohadi:  Mohadi has engaged in efforts to politicize </p><p>food distribution.  As reported reftel, he told NGOs </p><p>distributing food in Gwanda that they would have to follow </p><p>government directives and that their equipment would be taken </p><p>over by the GOZ.  The fact that he is now, as Minister of </p><p>Home Affairs, in charge of Zimbabwe\'s police force, does not </p><p>inspire confidence that we will soon see a return to the rule </p><p>of law. </p><p> </p><p>Witness Mangwende: ZANU-PF\'s deputy secretary for </p><p>administration, Mangwende has previously served in </p><p>Ministerial positions at Foreign Affairs, Information and </p><p>Publicity, and Land and Agriculture.  Mangwende is a </p><p>hardliner who believes strongly in the moral rectitude of </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s fast track resettlement effort.  In a June 2001 </p><p>meeting between Speaker of Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa and </p><p>incoming AF/S Director Scott Delisi, Mangwende made no </p><p>attempt at diplomatic niceties, rudely rejecting the validity </p><p>of U.S. interest in internal Zimbabwean developments. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
