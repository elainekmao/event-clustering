<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003346 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 12/17/12 </p><p>TAGS: KSCA, OPDC, OSCI, PREL, SOCI, TBIO, TSPL, KHIV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MINISTER OF HEALTH PLEDGES </p><p>COOPERATION ON THE PRESIDENT\'S INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MOTHER AND CHILD HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 241028 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) On December 16, Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>accompanied by USAID Acting Director, USAID </p><p>HIV/AIDS Officer and CDC/Nigeria Statistician, </p><p>presented the joint letter from Secretaries </p><p>Powell and Thompson on the President\'s </p><p>International Mother and Child HIV/AIDS </p><p>Initiative (reftel) and delivered the steering </p><p>committee\'s survey to GON Minister of Health, </p><p>A.B.C. Nwosu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Minister received the letter and </p><p>talking points with enthusiasm and thanked </p><p>President Bush and the people of the United </p><p>States for the Initiative.  Citing his personal </p><p>commitment to the success of the program, Nwosu </p><p>said that combating HIV/AIDS is one of his </p><p>Ministry\'s core objectives. The Minister said he </p><p>appreciated the Initiative\'s focus on mother and </p><p>child transmission because it reinforces his </p><p>position that HIV/AIDS should be viewed as more </p><p>than a sexually transmitted disease and he has </p><p>reorganized the Ministry to reflect this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Nwosu promised the full cooperation of </p><p>the Ministry and suggested the establishment a </p><p>joint committee between the Ministry of Health </p><p>and the USG, whose Nigerian counterparts he </p><p>immediately named. The Minister was hopeful that </p><p>the Mother and Child HIV/ AIDS Initiative would </p><p>support the GON\'s efforts to determine the </p><p>actual size of their HIV positive population. </p><p>Nwosu added that President Obasanjo recently </p><p>asked the Ministry for an accurate count of the </p><p>HIV population in the country, which they began </p><p>by surveying a population of 600,000. The real </p><p>gap in HIV/AIDS health services is in rural </p><p>areas, the Minister said. To be worthwhile, this </p><p>Initiative must have a broad reach that includes </p><p>those areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador also briefed the Minister </p><p>on the proposed POTUS visit to the National </p><p>Hospital for a HIV/AIDS event. The Minister will </p><p>play a leading role in welcoming POTUS to the </p><p>National Hospital.  Nwosu was optimistic that a </p><p>POTUS visit to Nigeria and the HIV/AIDS </p><p>initiative may encourage the Presidency to </p><p>release much needed funding for HIV/AIDS.  Nwosu </p><p>admitted, however, that he is reluctant to </p><p>accept any funding until he has a plan that will </p><p>result in success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: The Minister welcomed this </p><p>initiative and demonstrated his willingness to </p><p>go beyond rhetoric to support it.  The GON </p><p>acknowledges that HIV/AIDS is a serious problem </p><p>in Nigeria but they still lack a consensus plan </p><p>to confront it. The President\'s initiative is a </p><p>welcome opportunity for the GON to develop a </p><p>plan of action to prevent mother-to-child </p><p>transmission and it will be received in Nigeria </p><p>with great enthusiasm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
