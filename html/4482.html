<p>S E C R E T RANGOON 001517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, BM, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA AND IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) Summary:  An official Burmese delegation headed by </p><p>the Minister of Forestry traveled to Baghdad in March and </p><p>concluded agreements to cooperate with the Government of Iraq </p><p>on trade, banking and finance, oil and gas, scientific </p><p>research and technical issues, and in other areas.  The </p><p>agreed minutes of the Burma-Iraq meetings, marked "Secret" by </p><p>the GOB, were presented to the Government of Burma in October </p><p>and obtained by Post in November.  A copy will be pouched to </p><p>EAP/BCLTV.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The 4-6 March 2002 Baghdad meetings were an outgrowth </p><p>of the "Agreement on Trade, Economic, Scientific and </p><p>Technical Cooperation between the Government of the Union of </p><p>Myanmar and the Government of the Republic of Iraq" signed on </p><p>6 August 2001 in Baghdad, according to this document. </p><p> </p><p>-- The seven-person Burmese delegation was lead by Aung </p><p>Phone, Minister of Forestry, and included the deputy minister </p><p>of energy, the Burmese ambassador to Egypt, and the managing </p><p>director of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd, a large </p><p>state-owned conglomerate. </p><p> </p><p>--  The 23-member Iraqi side was led by the Minister of </p><p>Planning, Dr. Hassan Al-Khattab.  The Burmese delegation was </p><p>also "received by" Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadhan, </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Hekmat Al-Azawi and the ministers of </p><p>finance, trade, oil, and agriculture. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) The vague and wide-ranging agreement included pledges </p><p>to cooperate in such benign fields as honeybee breeding and </p><p>garbage disposal systems.  The counter-trade proposal </p><p>suggested Burmese agricultural and other products be traded </p><p>for Iraqi "fertilizers, bitumen, and sulfer" (sic).  The two </p><p>sides pledged to exchange "scientific and technical </p><p>information between specialized scientific research </p><p>institutions in both countries in the fields of irrigation </p><p>and water resources management."  The minutes end with an </p><p>agreement to hold a second session of the Joint Committee in </p><p>Rangoon in March 2003. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) We note that the two dictatorships also agreed to </p><p>draft a bilateral agreement "concerning National News </p><p>Agencies, TV Broadcasting organizations" and to an "exchange </p><p>of training courses, on a reciprocal basis in the field of </p><p>media and information." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) Comment:  The Burma-Iraq trade reported by other </p><p>channels may be an outgrowth of the 2001 agreement and/or </p><p>this March 2002 session of the Burma-Iraq Joint Committee. </p><p>The agreed minutes of this meeting contain no individual </p><p>elements that are particularly worrying in themselves.  The </p><p>document clearly portrays the relationship between Iraq and </p><p>Burma as cordial and cooperative, with a pledge "to further </p><p>enhance relations between the two countries in all fields." </p><p> </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
