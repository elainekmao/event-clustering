<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 01 TEHRAN 12130 </p><p> </p><p>Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic </p><p>Review 30 JUN 2006 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12065: GES 9/17/95 (LIMBERT, JOHN) OR-P </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINT, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: PM BAZARGAN CRITICIZED </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS, PM MEHDI BAZARGAN </p><p>HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF CRITICISMS FROM VARIOUS SIDES. HE HAS </p><p>BEEN ACCUSED OF ANTI-CLERICALISM, OF INEFFECTIVENESS, AND OF </p><p>GENERAL BUNGLING. BAZARGAN HAS ANSWERED THESE ATTACKS BY </p><p>CLAIMING THAT THE SAME PERSONS WHO WERE CRITICIZING HIM ARE </p><p>NOT ALLOWING HIS GOVERNMENT TO FUNCTION. DEPSITE THESE </p><p>ATTACKS, IT APPEARS THAT BAZARGAN STILL ENJOYS THE SUPPORT </p><p>OF KHOMEINI AND WILL NOT BE REPLACED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE FIRST ATTACK ON BAZARGAN CAME FROM AYATOLLAH DR. </p><p>MOHAMMAD BEHESHTI, VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS, </p><p>MEMBER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLICAN PARTY. IN AN </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH PARS NEW AGENCY IN QOM ON SEPTEMBER 14, DR. </p><p>BEHESHTI BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT AND PM BAZARGAN FOR FAILING </p><p>TO IMPLEMENT A BILL ON THE FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO BEHESHTI, THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL TWO MONTHS </p><p>BEFORE HAD APPROVED A BILL CALLING FOR THE FORMATION OF </p><p>COUNCILS AT PROVINCE, CITY, DISTRICT, AND VILLAGE LEVELS. </p><p>BEHESHTI SAID DR. BAZARGAN\'S GOVERNMENT FAILED TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>THIS BILL, EITHER BECAUSE OF DELIBERATE PROCRASTINATION OR </p><p>BECAUSE OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE WEAKNESS. (DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BANI-ASSADI TOLD CHARGE SEPT 17 THAT BAZARGAN\'S </p><p>OFFICE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING THE REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>COUNCIL\'S BILL, HAD SENT A LETTER TO THE COUNCIL TELLING </p><p>THEM THAT THE BILL AS DRAFTED WAS UNREALISTIC BUT THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK OUT A FEASIBLE BILL ALONG THOSE LINES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) LATER THE SAME DAY, THE MONOTHEISM PARY (HEZB-E- </p><p>TOWHIDI) ISSUED A SEVEN-POINT STATEMENT CRITICIZING THE </p><p>BAZARGAN GOVERNMENT FOR NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE. LITTLE IS </p><p>KNOWN ABOUT THE HEZB-E-TOWHIDI EXCEPT THAT IT IS AN ISLAMIC </p><p>POLITICAL GROUPING WITH POSSIBLE TIES TO AYATOLLAH SADEQ </p><p>ROWHANI. THE CRITICISMS DIRECTED AT BAZARGAN INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>-  (A) GOVERNMENT INDIFFERENCE TO CRITICISMS OF IRAN IN THE </p><p>FOREIGN PRESS, BOTH WESTERN AND NON-ALIGNED. </p><p> </p><p>-  (B) SEEKING POPULARITY BY PLAYING WITH WORDS AND BY </p><p>OPPOSING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. "PERHAPS YOU </p><p>HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THE IRANIAN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT IS LED BY </p><p>THE CLERGY." </p><p> </p><p>-  (C) DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL\'S BILL </p><p>ON FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. </p><p> </p><p>-  (D) NEGLECTING TO FOLLOW AYATOLLAH ROWHANI\'S ADVICE ABOUT </p><p>THE NECESSITY OF PURGING THE GOVERNMENT OF ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>ELEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THESE ATTACKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY AN ATTACK ON </p><p>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15 BY REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AND COUNCIL </p><p>OF EXPERTS MEMBER ABU-AL-HASAN BANI-SADR. SPEAKING TO AN </p><p>AUDIENCE IN YAZD, BANI-SADR ATTACKED BAZARGAN\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICIES AND ACCUSED HIM OF HINDERING THE WORK OF THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. BANI-SADR ALSO ACCUSED BAZARGAN OF: </p><p> </p><p>-  (A) REFUSING TO ACCEPT CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. </p><p> </p><p>-  (B) BUNGLING IN KURDESTAN AND THEN TRYING TO CLAIM CREDIT </p><p>FOR GOVERNMENT ACTION THERE. </p><p> </p><p>-  (C) OPPOSING THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKS, A FAVORITE </p><p>PROGRAM OF BANI-SADR. </p><p> </p><p>-  (D) BURYING HIMSELF IN TRIVIA AND NOT ORGANIZING HIS WORK </p><p>PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) IN AN ATTACK APPEARING IN THE ENGLISH AND PERSIAN- </p><p>LANGUAGE PRESS OF SEPTEMBER 16, TEHRAN REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>PROSECUTOR AYATOLLAH AHMAD AZARI-QOMI CRITICIZED BAZARGAN </p><p>FOR ALLEGEDLY ANTI-CLERICAL STATEMENTS IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>EULOGY FOR AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11. AZARI-QOMI (WHO ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION FOR </p><p>HEALTH REASONS) SAID THAT BAZARGAN HAD SAID THAT TALEGHANI, </p><p>UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS, WAS NOT OPPOSED TO </p><p>THE MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION. ACCUSING BAZARGAN </p><p> OF WEAKENING REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, AZARI-QOMI SAID, "IT IS </p><p>VERY STRANGE THAT A DISTINGUISHED FIGURE AS MR. BAZARGAN WOULD </p><p>MAKE AN UNFAIR ACCUSATION AGAINST THE CLERGY. WAS IT NOT </p><p>TALEGHANI\'S GOAL TO UNITE ALL GROUPS, THE FOREMOST OF WHICH </p><p>WAS A COMMITTED AND ACTIVE CLERGY? HOW CAN HE (BAZARGAN) PRAISE </p><p>TALEGHANI BY STIRRING UP THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE CLERGY AND BY </p><p>CONDEMNING THIS PROGRESSIVE AND ACTIVE GROUP AS REACTIONARY?" </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) LOCAL PRESS ACCOUNTS OF BAZARGAN\'S SPEECH DID NOT </p><p>INCLUDE THE STATEMENTS WHICH OFFENDED AZARI-QOMI. EMBASSY WILL </p><p>CHECK FULL TEXT OF SPEECH (WHEN AVAILABLE) TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY </p><p>WHAT PRIME MINISTER SAID. </p><p> </p><p>7. ALTHOUGH THE PRESS HAS BEEN GIVING WIDE PUBLICITY TO THESE </p><p>ATTACKS, BAZARGAN\'S REACTION HAS SO FAR BEEN LIMITED TO A </p><p>STATEMENT AT AN ECONOMIC SEMINAR (REPORTED BY ETTELAAT OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 16) THAT THE SAME (UNNAMED PERSONS WHO WERE </p><p>CRITICIZING HIS GOVERNMENT FOR ITS INEFFECTIVENESS WERE THE </p><p>SAME ONES WHO WERE INTERFERING IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND </p><p>PREVENTING HIS CABINET FROM OPERATING.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME (NOR WILL IT BE THE LAST </p><p>TIME) THAT BAZARGAN HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK FROM MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE ATTACKS COMING FROM VARIOUS DIRECTIONS AND FROM </p><p>VARIOUS PERSONALITIES, ARE NOT NECESSARILY PART OF ANY CONCERTED </p><p>ANTI-BAZARGAN CAMPAIGN, THERE ARE ENOUGH COMMON THEMESE IN THE </p><p>CRITICISMS TO INDICATE THE COMMON INTERESTS OF HIS OPPONENTS. </p><p>THESE THEMES INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>-  (A) IGNORING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>-  (B) IGNORING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>-  (C) GENERAL INEFFECTIVENESS AND BUNGLING. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) IT IS WORTH NOTING, HOWEVER, THAT NONE OF THESE ATTACKS </p><p>MENTION AYYATOLLAH KHOMEINI BY NAME AND THAT NONE OF THE </p><p>ATTACKERS NOTE ANY CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR HIM. IN PREVIOUS </p><p>DISAGREEMENTS OF THIS KIND, BAZARGAN HAS HAD ENOUGH SUPPORT </p><p>FROM THE IMAM TO OVERCOME CALLS FOR HIS DISMISSAL. IT IS LIKELY </p><p>THAT AS LONG AS BAZARGAN CONTINUES TO HAVE KHOMEINI\'S SUPPORT </p><p>(AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF HIS LOSING IT) HE WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>SURVIVE SUCH ATTACKS. BAZARGAN\'S SURVIVAL, HOWEVER, IS UNLIKELY </p><p>TO MAKE HIS GOVERNMENT ANY MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH THOSE </p><p>WHO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OVER MOST OF HIS FUNCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>LAINGEN </p><p></p></div>
