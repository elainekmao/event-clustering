SUMMARY:  FOLLOWERS OF VIETNAM\'S HOA HAO RELIGION </p><p>HAVE ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE FREEDOM TO WORSHIP SINCE THE </p><p>GVN GRANTED OFFICIAL RECOGNITION IN 1999 TO THIS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY OUTLAWED BUDDHIST SECT.  DURING A JUNE 23-25 </p><p>VISIT TO AN GIANG PROVINCE IN THE MEKONG DELTA, POLOFF </p><p>VISITED A SPARKLING NEW HOA HAO BUDDHIST PAGODA AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00695  01 OF 02  150601Z </p><p>SPOKE WITH SEVERAL OPTIMISTIC FOLLOWERS OF THE RELIGION </p><p>AT PHU MY (HOA HAO) VILLAGE.  ON JUNE 28, MORE THAN </p><p>200,000 HOA HAO DEVOTEES JOURNEYED TO PHU MY TO ATTEND </p><p>AN ANNUAL RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL.  STILL, SOME BELIEVERS </p><p>REMAIN DISSATISFIED WITH THE GVN\'S HANDLING OF HOA HAO </p><p>AFFAIRS, AND THE GVN REMAINS WARY OF HOA HAO MONKS IT </p><p>CONSIDERS "DISSIDENT."  SEPTEL WILL REPORT ON A HOA HAO </p><p>MONK RECENTLY RELEASED FROM PRISON AND ON POLICE </p><p>PREVENTING POLOFF FROM MEETING WITH ANOTHER DISSIDENT </p><p>MONK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FREEDOM TO WORSHIP </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. THE HOA HAO WERE AMONG THE LAST RESISTANCE TO </p><p>COMMUNIST FORCES IN THE MEKONG DELTA IN 1975.  THEIR </p><p>ANTI-COMMUNIST HISTORY STEMS FROM THE VIET MINH\'S </p><p>EXECUTION OF THEIR FOUNDER, HUYNH PHU SO, IN 1947.  IN </p><p>SUMMER 1975, THE GOVERNMENT DISBANDED THE HOA HAO, </p><p>CONFISCATED THEIR PROPERTIES, AND OUTLAWED THEIR </p><p>PRACTICES.  BECAUSE ITS BASIC TENETS EMPHASIZE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY PRAYER AT HOME RATHER THAN PUBLIC </p><p>WORSHIP AT PAGODAS, THE RELIGION SURVIVED. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN 1999, THE GVN ORGANIZED A HOA HAO CONGRESS THAT </p><p>SELECTED OFFICERS FOR A NEW GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED HOA </p><p>HAO REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE. THIS LED TO OFFICIAL GVN </p><p>RECOGNITION LATER IN THE YEAR.  MANY HOA HAO FOLLOWERS </p><p>ALLEGE THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE IS ANYTHING </p><p>BUT REPRESENTATIVE -- THE 11 OFFICERS ELECTED AT THE </p><p>CONGRESS WERE THE SAME 11 PERSONS THE GVN HAD SELECTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00695  01 OF 02  150601Z </p><p>TO ORGANIZE THE CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>4. SINCE RECOGNITION IN 1999, THE GVN HAS RELAXED </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY ITS EARLIER RESTRICTIONS ON HOA HAO </p><p>PRACTICE.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOA HAO BELIEVERS MAY NOW </p><p>WORSHIP FREELY IN THEIR HOMES AND PUBLICLY AT </p><p>RECOGNIZED PAGODAS.  THE GVN NO LONGER FORBIDS DISPLAY </p><p>OF THE FOUNDER\'S PHOTOGRAPH, ALTHOUGH IT STILL </p><p>PROHIBITS DISPLAY OF THE HOA HAO FLAG.  THE OFFICIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE HAS PUBLISHED SOME, BUT NOT </p><p>ALL, OF THE HOA HAO SACRED LITERATURE.  PROVINCIAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAVE RETURNED A FEW PREVIOUSLY CONFISCATED </p><p>PAGODAS, BUT CONTINUE TO HOLD AND USE FOR OTHER </p><p>PURPOSES MOST HOA HAO PROPERTIES THAT HAD BEEN </p><p>CONFISCATED AFTER 1975. </p><p> </p><p>NEW HOA HAO PAGODA </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. ON JUNE 24, POLOFF MADE AN UNSCHEDULED STOP AT </p><p>SPARKLING NEW PHU THO ONG BA HOA HAO PAGODA IN CHO MOI </p><p>DISTRICT IN AN GIANG PROVINCE.  THE PAGODA MANAGER, MR. </p><p>NGUYEN VAN THOI, SAID FLOODING TWO YEARS EARLIER HAD </p><p>SEVERELY DAMAGED AN OLDER PAGODA BY THE SAME NAME, </p><p>LOCATED NEARBY.  HE AND OTHER HOA HAO FOLLOWERS </p><p>REQUESTED AND RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM THE LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND THE OFFICIAL HOA HAO REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE TO BUILD A NEW PAGODA.  MR. THOI CONFIRMED </p><p>THAT PHU THO ONG BA WAS THE FIRST NEW HOA HAO PAGODA TO </p><p>BE BUILT SINCE BEFORE 1975; CONSTRUCTION WAS COMPLETED </p><p>IN MAY 2002. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00695  01 OF 02  150601Z </p><p> </p><p>6. MR. THOI, HIS DEPUTY, THE SENIOR MONK, THREE OTHER </p><p>MONKS, AND APPROXIMATELY 30 ORDINARY HOA HAO BELIEVERS </p><p>WERE PRESENT AT THE PAGODA WHEN POLOFF VISITED. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE MONKS AND BELIEVERS APPEARED PLEASED BY </p><p>POLOFF\'S UNANNOUNCED VISIT, MR. THOI SEEMED A BIT </p><p>DISCONCERTED.  STILL HE INVITED POLOFF TO STAY FOR </p><p>LUNCH.  DURING THE MEAL, MR. THOI, HIS DEPUTY, AND A </p><p>FEMALE FOLLOWER WHO MAY HAVE BEEN A HOA HAO NUN SAID </p><p>THAT RECOGNITION OF THE HOA HAO IN 1999 HAD MADE LIFE </p><p>EASIER.  THEY WOULD NOT BE DRAWN OUT ON SPECIFIC ISSUES </p><p>WHERE THEY HAD SEEN IMPROVEMENT, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>7. MR. THOI SAID THAT SINCE 1999, HOA HAO COMMITTEES </p><p>HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AT PROVINCIAL, DISTRICT, AND </p><p>COMMUNE LEVELS IN AREAS WHERE HOA HAO BELIEVERS ARE </p><p>POPULOUS.  HE AVOIDED POLOFF\'S QUESTIONS ON WHETHER </p><p>THESE COMMITTEES WERE ELECTED OR APPOINTED. </p><p> </p><p>8. THE SENIOR MONK TOOK POLOFF ON A TOUR OF THE PAGODA, </p><p>WHICH CONTAINED SEVERAL BUDDHIST SHRINES SET UP IN TWO </p><p>SPACIOUS ROOMS.  WORSHIPPERS PRAYED AND BURNED INCENSE </p><p>AT THE SHRINES, WHICH DISPLAYED EITHER RED WOODEN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9878 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HO CHI  00695  02 OF 02  150602Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    UTED-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      MOFM-05  MOF-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OPIC-01  PRS-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------CB0CE3  150602Z /38 </p><p>P 150450Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6510 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY HANOI PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/PD/KFOSTER </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BLOCKS TO SYMBOLIZE THE BUDDHA OR SMALL FIGURES OF </p><p>BODHISATTVAS.  THE CENTRAL FIGURE AT ONE OF THE MORE </p><p>PROMINENT SHRINES WAS A BUST OF HO CHI MINH.  IT </p><p>APPEARED THAT WORSHIPPERS PRAYED AND BURNED INCENSE IN </p><p>FRONT OF THIS STATUE IN THE SAME WAY THEY DID AT THE </p><p>OTHER SHRINES.  (NOTE: VIETNAMESE RELIGIOUS PRACTICE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00695  02 OF 02  150602Z </p><p>INCLUDES VENERATION OF HISTORICAL PERSONALITIES.  THERE </p><p>ARE SMALL STATUES/PORTRAITS OF HO CHI MINH IN OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENT-REGULATED PAGODAS.  VENERATION OF HISTORICAL </p><p>FIGURES, HOWEVER, USUALLY IS PERFORMED IN A PAGODA-LIKE </p><p>STRUCTURE CALLED A "DEN."  FOR HISTORICAL REASONS, THE </p><p>BUST OF HO CHI MINH INSIDE A HOA HAO PAGODA SEEMED </p><p>INCONGRUOUS.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>VISIT TO PHU MY (HOA HAO) VILLAGE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. ALSO ON JUNE 24, POLOFF VISITED AN HOA (THE MAIN HOA </p><p>HAO PAGODA) AND TO DINH (THE HOA HAO FOUNDER\'S </p><p>ANCESTRAL HOME), BOTH PILGRIMAGE SITES IN PHU MY (HOA </p><p>HAO) VILLAGE.  THE OFFICIAL HOA HAO REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE, WHOSE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT AN HOA PAGODA, </p><p>PREVIOUSLY HAD DECLINED TO MEET WITH POLOFF.  THEY </p><p>EXPLAINED THEY WERE TOO BUSY WITH PREPARATIONS FOR THE </p><p>ANNUAL FOUNDING DAY FESTIVAL - FALLING ON JUNE 28. </p><p> </p><p>10. PREPARATIONS FOR THE FESTIVAL INDEED WERE IN FULL </p><p>SWING.  POLOFF SAW SCORES OF PEOPLE BUSY PACKAGING </p><p>FOODS AND CONSTRUCTING SHELTERS FOR THE TENS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF HOA HAO FOLLOWERS EXPECTED TO DESCEND ON </p><p>THE VILLAGE FOUR DAYS LATER.  HUNDREDS OF HOA HAO </p><p>FOLLOWERS ALREADY WERE VISITING AND WORSHIPPING AT THE </p><p>TWO PILGRIMAGE SITES.  (NOTE: ON A REGULAR DAY, BETWEEN </p><p>100 AND 200 FOLLOWERS VISIT AN HOA PAGODA.) </p><p> </p><p>11. POLOFF SPOKE TO SEVERAL OF THE ORDINARY HOA HAO </p><p>FOLLOWERS HE ENCOUNTERED.  THEY ALL EXPRESSED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00695  02 OF 02  150602Z </p><p>APPRECIATION THAT THEY NOW COULD COME TO THE PAGODA TO </p><p>WORSHIP FREELY AND PUBLICLY.  ONE FOLLOWER NOTED THAT </p><p>NEIGHBORING PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS HAD DISTRIBUTED A </p><p>CIRCULAR INFORMING HOA HAO BELIEVERS THAT THIS YEAR </p><p>THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO HOLD PUBLIC CEREMONIES TO </p><p>COMMEMORATE FOUNDING DAY IN THEIR OWN LOCALITIES. </p><p>(NOTE: THE GVN HAD PROHIBITED PUBLIC COMMEMORATION OF </p><p>FOUNDING DAY BEFORE 1999, AND FROM 1999 UNTIL THIS YEAR </p><p>HAD RESTRICTED IT TO PHU MY VILLAGE.) </p><p> </p><p>12. AFTER FOUNDING DAY, POLOFF SPOKE TO SEVERAL HOA HAO </p><p>CONTACTS WHO TOLD HIM THAT BETWEEN 200,000 AND 250,000 </p><p>PERSONS HAD MADE THE PILGRIMAGE TO PHU MY.  THEY PRAYED </p><p>AT THE PAGODA, BURNED INCENSE AT THE ANCESTRAL HOME, </p><p>LISTENED TO SPEECHES, AND PICNICKED IN A FESTIVE </p><p>ATMOSPHERE, ACCORDING TO THESE CONTACTS.  MOST OF THE </p><p>ATTENDEES WERE FROM THE MEKONG DELTA -- ABLE TO MAKE </p><p>THE JOURNEY AND RETURN HOME THE SAME DAY.  MANY PEOPLE, </p><p>HOWEVER, STAYED OVERNIGHT OR FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS WITH </p><p>FRIENDS, RELATIVES, OR AT HOTELS.  POLOFF, WHO HAD </p><p>ATTENDED THE 1999 FOUNDING DAY FESTIVAL AND HAS VISITED </p><p>PHU MY VILLAGE THREE TIMES SINCE, NOTICED SEVERAL </p><p>HOTELS, SHOPS, AND OTHER SIGNS OF A TOURIST INDUSTRY </p><p>THAT WERE NOT APPARENT THREE YEARS EARLIER. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>13. RECOGNITION OF THE HOA HAO IN 1999 HAS LED TO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT FREEDOM OF WORSHIP FOR ORDINARY HOA HAO </p><p>FOLLOWERS.  SOME BELIEVERS, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO </p><p>CRITICIZE THE NON-DEMOCRATIC MANNER IN WHICH THE GVN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00695  02 OF 02  150602Z </p><p>ESTABLISHED THE OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE. </p><p>LEADERS OF THE PRE-1975 HOA HAO CHURCH ARE STILL ANGRY </p><p>AT BEING EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATING IN ADMINISTERING </p><p>HOA HAO AFFAIRS.  LOCAL AUTHORITIES, MOREOVER, CONTINUE </p><p>TO CLOSELY MONITOR AND SOMETIMES HARASS MONKS OR OTHER </p><p>BELIEVERS WHO ORGANIZE WORSHIP ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENT </p><p>OF THE OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
