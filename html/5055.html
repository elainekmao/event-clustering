January 9: "La Tribuna," a Liberal Party Tegucigalpa- </p><p>based daily, carried a full-page article on the CAFTA launch </p><p>using IIP press release with headline "U.S. and Central </p><p>American countries initiated free trade negotiations." </p><p> </p><p>2. "Tiempo," San Pedro Sula-based liberal paper owned by </p><p>businessman and congressional deputy Jaime Rosenthal, also </p><p>carried the banner headline: "CAFTA negotiations will bump </p><p>agricultural products" and "U.S. and Central America will </p><p>strengthen trade." </p><p> </p><p>3. "El Heraldo," moderate Tegucigalpa-based daily, and "La </p><p>Prensa," Liberal daily based in San Pedro Sula carried full </p><p>page articles, entitled respectively "Central America and </p><p>the U.S. on the way to Free Trade" and "The first agreements </p><p>of the Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. -have been </p><p>reached" </p><p> </p><p>4. January 10: "El Heraldo" and "Tiempo" carried half-page </p><p>articles on CAFTA from a Washington-based reporter: "North </p><p>American Manufacturers support CAFTA." </p><p> </p><p>5. National TV and radio news program gave full coverage to </p><p>the CAFTA launch using the IIP press release and </p><p>international video.  Nation-wide radio station HRN and </p><p>Radio America read the press release. </p><p> </p><p>6. An editorial in "Tiempo" entitled: U.S. and Central </p><p>American Free Trade Agreement"- "the first free trade </p><p>negotiations between Central American countries and the U.S. </p><p>promoted by President Bush will take place at the end of the </p><p>month. The completion of CAFTA has among its political goals </p><p>that Central America should be prepared to join the FTAA - </p><p>projected to be completed in 2005, although at the moment </p><p>several MERCOSUR countries have expressed a strong </p><p>opposition to an FTAA agreement and the creation of </p><p>sufficient employment to avoid the loss of the Central </p><p>American labor force to migration to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>7. "There is no doubt that these negotiations will be </p><p>complex and difficult, because in between there are two </p><p>asymmetric bases: "the unequal development among Central </p><p>American countries, and that of Central America with the </p><p>U.S." In general terms what it pictures is the shark and the </p><p>sardines. </p><p> </p><p>8. "The fact is that Central American negotiators should be </p><p>of great experience in order to present the value of the </p><p>regional development situation and translate these into an </p><p>adequate safe-guard without losing sight of the importance </p><p>of the global feeling of these negotiations."  They must </p><p>also pay special attention to production problems and </p><p>farming commercialization, which is the backbone of the </p><p>Central American economies; for this, they need to pay </p><p>attention to the Mexican experience with NAFTA" </p><p> </p><p>9. "The completion and implementation of CAFTA is a </p><p>overarching goal of regional development, but only if we </p><p>know how to negotiate and discover in the North American </p><p>positions a true understanding and political support for </p><p>building a growing economy in Central America the importance </p><p>of the inclusion of the labor rights so vital to Central </p><p>American integration." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
