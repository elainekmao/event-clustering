<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000468 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PD, S/CT, NEA/NGA, </p><p>DS/DSS/ITA, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 03-20-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, KPAO, ASEC, CE, MV, IZ, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01:  Low-key reaction in Sri </p><p>Lanka/Maldives to start of military operations </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 200727Z Mar 03 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) State 72921 </p><p>-      (C) State 72913 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 463 </p><p>-      (E) Colombo 460, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) SUMMARY:  General reaction in Sri Lanka and the </p><p>Maldives to the start of military operations against </p><p>Iraq has been low-key, so far.  The PM has asked to see </p><p>the Ambassador late today.  Sri Lanka\'s envoy to the </p><p>U.S. called the Ambassador earlier, and said the GSL </p><p>plans to issue a "helpful" statement re the situation. </p><p>Latest demarche re Iraqi intel officials has been </p><p>conveyed to the GSL.  Media coverage continues to be </p><p>heavy.  A test of local reaction will come after Muslim </p><p>prayers on March 21.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) INTERACTIONS WITH GSL:  Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe has invited Ambassador Wills to see him </p><p>late today.  The PM almost certainly wants to discuss </p><p>the developing situation.  We will brief Department </p><p>after the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In the meantime, Sri Lankan Ambassador to the </p><p>U.S. Devinda Subasinghe called Ambassador Wills early </p><p>March 20 (before the actual commencement of military </p><p>operations) and said the GSL was planning on issuing a </p><p>"helpful" statement re the Iraq situation.  (Note:  The </p><p>PM had also told the Ambassador this on March 19 -- See </p><p>Ref E.)  Subasinghe said domestic political (e.g., </p><p>Muslim) sensitivities and other complexities </p><p>(specifically President Kumraratunga\'s likely </p><p>objections) would prevent the GSL from actually coming </p><p>out and publicly joining the U.S.-led coalition of the </p><p>willing. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) Per Ref B, Mission has conveyed the latest </p><p>demarche pressing for the expulsion of Iraqi officials </p><p>and the closure of the regime\'s embassy to the GSL.  We </p><p>will continue to press government interlocutors re this </p><p>high-priority matter. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SRI LANKA REACTION:  The news that military </p><p>operations had commenced broke in Sri Lanka just before </p><p>9:00 am, March 20.  Most Sri Lankans were already at </p><p>work at this point and traffic continued to proceed </p><p>normally in Colombo.  There have been no reports of </p><p>disturbances.  Mission has been in touch with contacts </p><p>in mainly Muslim areas of the east and Puttalam District </p><p>north of Colombo, and they report that the situation is </p><p>quiet.  There was a demonstration by Muslims north of </p><p>Batticaloa town early March 20, but it reportedly ended </p><p>peacefully.  Per Ref D, an anti-U.S. rally is slated to </p><p>take place in Colombo after Muslim prayers on Friday, </p><p>March 21, and we have heard of some other rallies at </p><p>other sites in country.  (Note:  Mission held an EAC on </p><p>March 20 -- see Septel.  The police have contacted RSO </p><p>and promised unequivocal cooperation.  DCM is also </p><p>scheduled to attend a briefing for the diplomatic corps </p><p>given by the Interior Minister late March 20.  The </p><p>briefing will focus on the local security situation.) </p><p>(Note:  Mission has just received a report attributed to </p><p>AFP that someone in the Opposition People\'s Alliance </p><p>called President Bush a "war criminal."  We are looking </p><p>into the report, which is contained in Ref A.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MALDIVES REACTION:  In a conversation focused on </p><p>other subjects, Polchief asked Dr. Shaheed, the </p><p>Permanent Secretary of the Maldivian MFA, about the </p><p>situation in Male.  Shaheed said all was quiet, noting </p><p>that he did not expect any rallies or demonstrations to </p><p>take place.  Poloff also spoke to Minh Pham (Amcit--pls </p><p>protect), the UN coordinator for the Maldives, who </p><p>confirmed that the situation was quiet.  Pham added that </p><p>many Maldivians were watching news of the developing </p><p>situation on CNN and BBC.  His overall impression was </p><p>that Maldivians did not support the war, but were </p><p>"resigned" to it.  The government website "Haveeru" </p><p>contained AFP wire service reports re the situation, but </p><p>no commentary. </p><p>7. (U) MEDIA COVERAGE:  The front-pages of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>newspapers were full of stories re the Gulf situation on </p><p>March 20, although the latest news re the ongoing Sri </p><p>Lankan peace talks was also given significant coverage. </p><p>The start of the military campaign took place after </p><p>papers were published, so most Iraq-related articles in </p><p>March 20 editions focused on the runup to war.  After </p><p>the war started, TV stations were full of news re the </p><p>situation.  Conforming to the general anti-U.S. slant of </p><p>many press pieces here, an editorial in the Opposition </p><p>English-language ISLAND entitled "From Satyr to Martyr?" </p><p>stated: </p><p> </p><p>"This war is not only bound to bring about radical </p><p>changes in the politics of Iraq and that of the Middle </p><p>East...It will also turn the new political order that </p><p>was taking shape after the Cold War topsy turvy (as the) </p><p>the democratic idealism that gradually came to the </p><p>forefront in US foreign policy (is)...replaced with </p><p>sheer militarism and disregard for international law and </p><p>the UN.  The world can only hope that what is happening </p><p>is an aberration."  (Note:  See Ref D for additional </p><p>text from this editorial.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  At this point, our sense is that Sri </p><p>Lankans are just absorbing the news that war has begun </p><p>and are collecting their thoughts.  Our best educated </p><p>guess is that the situation will remain relatively calm </p><p>here primarily for the good reason that Sri Lanka has </p><p>plenty of other fish to tandoori.  A test will come </p><p>after Muslim prayers on Friday, March 21, when religious </p><p>extremists and leftists will try to bring out crowds and </p><p>test the government\'s commitment to keep the situation </p><p>under control.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
