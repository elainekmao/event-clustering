<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000188 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, SNAR, PGOV, PHUM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR\'S FIRST MEETING WITH G-13 </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES (DONOR DIALOGUE GROUP) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  The Ambassador met on January 14 with </p><p>members of the Donor Dialogue group (6 major bilateral </p><p>donors, plus 4 multilaterals, MINUGUA, USAID, and UNDP) to </p><p>discuss development cooperation and preparations for the </p><p>May consultative group meeting. Ambassadors and IFI Reps </p><p>queried the Ambassador on possible narcotics </p><p>decertification, voicing concern that it could negatively </p><p>impact on promoting the Peace Accord agenda and the </p><p>Consultative Group meeting scheduled for May, as well as </p><p>complicate multilateral loan review and approval processes. </p><p>Spain cautioned that decertification could influence </p><p>Guatemalan electoral outcomes.  The Ambassador said the USG </p><p>is committed to promoting peace, human rights, anti- </p><p>corruption -- not just a narrow anti-drug agenda -- and </p><p>described how U.S.-Central American trade negotiations </p><p>would also lend support for advancing a broad agenda.  He </p><p>discussed the difficulty that we would have in securing </p><p>Congressional ratification of a trade agreement if </p><p>Guatemala was not cooperating fully in counter-narcotics </p><p>efforts, and if there was not progress on human rights, </p><p>corruption and the like.  There was agreement to work </p><p>together on a public relations strategy that would preserve </p><p>the unified front and strength of the group\'s message </p><p>before GOG and civil society.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On January 14, the Ambassador, USAID Director </p><p>Anders and Deputy Director Kennedy met with Ambassadors </p><p>from the Netherlands, Spain, Canada, Germany, and Norway, </p><p>Charge d\'Affairs of Sweden, and Resident Representatives of </p><p>IDB, World Bank, EU and MINUGUA.  Following opening remarks </p><p>by the Ambassador on U.S. policy priorities in Guatemala </p><p>(improved cooperation in drug trafficking, trade </p><p>negotiations, Peace Accord implementation, improvements in </p><p>human rights and anti-corruption), the chair of the donor </p><p>dialogue group (Dutch Ambassador Arend Pieper) welcomed the </p><p>Ambassador\'s participation in the donor dialogue group, </p><p>noting how important U.S. leadership had been to organizing </p><p>the donor dialogue group, building credibility with civil </p><p>society, and facilitating a common front of donors at the </p><p>last Consultative Group.  Ambassador Pieper expressed his </p><p>hope that the donor dialogue group could again reach </p><p>consensus on a group statement for the upcoming </p><p>Consultative Group. </p><p> </p><p>Decertification, Peace Accords, and the Upcoming Elections </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Discussion quickly turned to the issue of possible </p><p>U.S. counter-narcotics decertification, with IDB </p><p>representative Barbery asking whether the public </p><p>announcement would make specific mention of involvement of </p><p>high level GOG officials in drug trafficking or </p><p>moneylaundering, or if the public statements would remain </p><p>more general.  Barbery noted that the Board members have </p><p>increasingly raised the issue of corruption in loan review </p><p>and approval meetings. The Canadian Ambassador asked about </p><p>the timing of the U.S. decision and benchmarks for a </p><p>recertification decision.  The Ambassador noted that any </p><p>U.S. public statement would be carefully crafted, and that </p><p>countries not certified would be reviewed periodically and </p><p>could be recertified when significant progress had been </p><p>made against quantifiable benchmarks.  The Ambassador noted </p><p>that we would again review Guatemala\'s level of cooperation </p><p>and efforts in September, along with other countries. </p><p>MINUGUA Rep. Koenigs noted that if decertified, a </p><p>"recertification" for Guatemala in September or October </p><p>could have tremendous impact on the Guatemalan elections. </p><p>The Spanish Ambassador echoed this concern, stating that a </p><p>decision would have negative ("nefasto") consequences. </p><p>The IDB opined that both the opposition and FRG would hope </p><p>to use certification in the upcoming electoral campaign, </p><p>either as a promise of future performance ("we\'ll get the </p><p>country recertified") or as a vote of confidence (if the </p><p>FRG succeeds in getting Guatemala recertified).  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that without a possibility of </p><p>recertification, the Portillo Administration would have </p><p>little incentive to make improvements, and that we would </p><p>make a judgment strictly on the merits of the government\'s </p><p>response. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) European countries and MINUGUA were especially </p><p>concerned that U.S. emphasis on drug trafficking would sap </p><p>what little implementation capability the Portillo </p><p>Administration had left, shifting resources and GOG </p><p>attention away from the Peace Accords and the nine point CG </p><p>agenda.  The World Bank rep noted the possibility that the </p><p>EU would soon release a report critical of Guatemalan </p><p>progress against the CG agenda, possibly coinciding with a </p><p>suspension of project funding, leading Guatemalan </p><p>authorities to question the utility of a CG later this </p><p>year.  (NOTE:  EU rep noted that a consultant\'s report </p><p>summarizing progress against the nine point CG agenda would </p><p>be presented and discussed in a meeting of EU members in </p><p>early February.  He noted that the EU had already discussed </p><p>suspending specific programs/activities where the GOG </p><p>lacked political will, and that they would soon make good </p><p>on the threat giving two examples, the failure of the </p><p>Government to appropriate counterpart funds for education </p><p>and justice sector programs.  The EU report will not be </p><p>made available publicly, nor to other Embassies.)  The </p><p>Ambassador responded to the concern about overemphasis on </p><p>drugs by detailing again the ways in which the CAFTA </p><p>process could be used to advance a broader agenda, largely </p><p>overlapping with Peace Accords goals. </p><p> </p><p>Leveraging GOG Performance in an Election Year </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Spurred by MINUGUA, there was a brief discussion </p><p>of various mechanisms for leveraging GOG performance during </p><p>a difficult election year.  MINUGUA noted several: </p><p>negotiation of a new IMF stand-by agreement; the CG meeting </p><p>in May; and formation of a special investigative body to </p><p>look into parallel forces.  U.S.-Central American trade </p><p>negotiations (including pressure that could be brought by </p><p>other Central American countries on Guatemala to "clean up </p><p>their act") is another.  The Swedish Charge noted that </p><p>their insistence on a CG this year was to keep the Peace </p><p>Accords front and center on the national agenda of this </p><p>Administration as well as that of the opposition parties. </p><p>He noted that the opposition\'s attention could be easily </p><p>shifted to another agenda, if allowed to by the </p><p>international community.  The Ambassador noted that we </p><p>would be supportive of the various efforts, especially the </p><p>creation of the special investigative body promoted by the </p><p>Human Rights Ombudsman.  He noted that the U.S. was seeking </p><p>ways to contribute financing, and urged other countries to </p><p>provide support.  (Note: The Canadian and Norwegian </p><p>ambassadors told him afterward that, in view of the </p><p>Ambassador\'s support, they would attend the January 16 </p><p>launching of the proposal. End note) </p><p> </p><p>A Carefully-Crafted Public Diplomacy Strategy Needed </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Ambassador Pieper suggested that the next meeting </p><p>of the donor dialogue group focus on how individual </p><p>countries and the group should respond as the media </p><p>attempts to build the case that the international community </p><p>is making good on conditionality expressed at the last </p><p>Consultative Group to withdraw funding if progress falters. </p><p>World Bank rep Somensatto suggested that it was equally </p><p>important to make sure to clarify differences, if any, on </p><p>member positions on bilateral versus multilateral </p><p>assistance.  He urged all members not to lose sight of the </p><p>importance of helping this Administration sustain macro- </p><p>economic stability during the election period.  Somensatto </p><p>also asked that the U.S. specifically, and donor group at </p><p>large, express public support for the National Commission </p><p>on Transparency and Corruption, so as to ensure this effort </p><p>is fully supported by Guatemalans. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) This was a lively and useful exchange of views </p><p>that brought concerns of our donor community colleagues </p><p>clearly into view.  Their fear that decertification will </p><p>hijack the Peace Accords agenda strikes us as a bit </p><p>overdrawn, and the Ambassador attempted to assuage these </p><p>concerns by emphasizing that our bilateral agenda is much </p><p>broader than just drug interdiction.  We will remain </p><p>actively engaged with this group. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
