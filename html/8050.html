(U) Classified by Charge D\'Affaires Richard A. Albright, </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Local press reported that commercial and residential </p><p>rents in Abu Dhabi jumped between twenty and thirty percent </p><p>in the last year as the UAE capital maintained its status </p><p>as one of the world\'s most expensive real estate markets. </p><p>Western property consultants confirmed that the increase </p><p>encompassed the whole rental market and not just unit </p><p>prices, and was primarily driven by a sharp rise in </p><p>commercial real estate rates mandated by the government </p><p>body which oversees building construction and rental in the </p><p>capital. Last year real estate grossed approximately $5.53 </p><p>billion -- a whopping nine percent of the UAE\'s total GDP, </p><p>making it the third largest GDP component after oil and </p><p>manufacturing.  Return on investment in real estate ranged </p><p>between 6-8 percent, considerably higher than the five </p><p>percent on stocks or 1-2 percent on bank deposits. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Rents in the capital are likely to increase further </p><p>in the next two years as the Abu Dhabi municipality has </p><p>temporarily decided to stop the common practice of </p><p>demolishing old buildings and replacing them with new, </p><p>larger structures.  The average operational life of a </p><p>building in the UAE is generally less than thirty years due </p><p>to poor construction materials and techniques compounded by </p><p>the excessively hot and humid weather which adversely </p><p>impacts concrete and metal. Given the continued demand for </p><p>commercial and residential space, the moratorium on </p><p>building replacement suggests that the Khalifa Committee, </p><p>chaired by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayed, </p><p>will likely raise the rental floor (i.e. the minimum amount </p><p>for which a given type/size of property may be rented) even </p><p>higher in the years to come. (Note: The Khalifa Committee </p><p>is the giant, Abu Dhabi government-funded real estate </p><p>cartel which controls residential and commercial </p><p>construction and rental in the greater capital area. The </p><p>primary mechanism for redistribution of oil wealth to the </p><p>general citizenry, the Khalifa Committee funds real estate </p><p>projects, supervises construction, arranges for the leasing </p><p>of buildings, and apportions rent to the ostensible owners </p><p>-- effectively mandating minimum rental prices for both </p><p>commercial and residential real estate. Unrentable </p><p>facilities are simply left vacant, at considerable cost to </p><p>the government. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Due to the lack of real estate options on </p><p>the island of Abu Dhabi, landlords know tenants have few </p><p>options when confronted with government mandated rent </p><p>increases.  The moratorium on destroying and replacing </p><p>older properties in Abu Dhabi -- a decision made by the </p><p>Khalifa Committee -- reflects a belt-tightening decision on </p><p>the part of government officials.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
