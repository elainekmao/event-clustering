<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002029 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01:  PM ABUL RAGHEB CONVOKES AMBASSADOR ON </p><p>IRAQI CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, NEED FOR MEPP MOVEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. FBIS GMP20030402000301 </p><p> </p><p>     B. FBIS GMP20030403000173 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. MUST DO MORE TO PROTECT CIVILIANS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb convoked the </p><p>Ambassador April 3 to deliver a message on Iraq.  Foreign </p><p>Minister Marwan Muasher was present, and PolCouns accompanied </p><p>the Ambassador.  Abul Ragheb said that Jordan opposed the war </p><p>and was not happy that it had started, but needed to be </p><p>pragmatic in its approach.  "People are angry about the war </p><p>and the fact that there was no UN approval."  Jordanians </p><p>"love the Iraqi people," and are rightfully concerned by the </p><p>images of civilian casualties in Iraq.  They are therefore </p><p>demanding that the GOJ do something about it.  The GOJ, </p><p>consequently, must ask that the U.S. and UK do more to stop </p><p>civilian casualties, end the war as soon as possible, and </p><p>provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi population. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  The final outcome in Iraq will have a large </p><p>influence on how Jordanians will ultimately view the </p><p>conflict, Abul Ragheb continued.  Iraq must remain united, </p><p>there must be no civil war, Iraqis must be able to choose </p><p>their leadership, and the coalition and the international </p><p>community will have to show immediate humanitarian concern. </p><p>General Garner, Abul Ragheb said, is being portrayed in the </p><p>Arabic media as "a friend of Sharon."  This point alone, Abul </p><p>Ragheb argued, could doom the legitimacy of the post-war </p><p>relief and rebuilding efforts in the eyes of many Arabs.  It </p><p>will be important to gain UN legitimacy for post-war </p><p>rebuilding and governance.  "People in Washington" who do not </p><p>want a UN role for post-war Iraq, "are very talented in </p><p>making you look bad" in the region. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  After delivering his points, the PM noted that King </p><p>Abdullah had given an interview April 2 to the official Petra </p><p>news agency in which he had used the word "ghazu" (attack or </p><p>invasion) to describe the war (ref a).  This new, stronger </p><p>language was meant, he said, to address the anger of </p><p>Jordanians against the war. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT IRAQI TREATMENT OF CIVILIANS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  The Ambassador responded by saying that the U.S. is </p><p>undertaking great efforts to minimize civilian casualties. </p><p>This concern is slowing the war tempo and putting U.S. </p><p>soldiers at greater risk, but it is something we believe we </p><p>must do.  Ultimately, however, it is the Iraqi regime which </p><p>is placing civilians at greater risk by using hospitals, </p><p>schools, and religious sites as storage depots and refuges, </p><p>and by dressing soldiers as civilians.  The Geneva Convention </p><p>was designed to eliminate precisely this risk to civilians in </p><p>wartime. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>...AND MORE ON THE MEPP WOULDN\'T HURT EITHER </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  Abul Ragheb and Muasher then launched into the need </p><p>for the U.S. to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process </p><p>following the war.  The first step must be to strengthen new </p><p>Palestinian PM Abu Mazen, and to convince Israel to do the </p><p>same.  Israel, Abul Ragheb said, must cease its "tough </p><p>actions against Palestinians:"  targeted killings, </p><p>incursions, and house demolitions.  This, more than anything </p><p>else, would strengthen Abu Mazen\'s hand. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  The Ambassador said Secretary Powell and Assistant </p><p>Secretary Burns are in Brussels and would meet with the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Quartet April 3.  He noted that the Secretary had also made a </p><p>strong statement on the need to stop settlement activity in </p><p>front of AIPAC last week.  Muasher and Abul Ragheb criticized </p><p>the AIPAC speech because of its "implied threat" to Syria, </p><p>but admitted that the statement on settlements was positive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  Only about 10 minutes of this hour-long conversation </p><p>dealt with Jordanian criticism of the war in Iraq, and the </p><p>criticism was largely pro-forma.  Abul Ragheb and Muasher </p><p>made it clear that they did not want to alarm the U.S. with </p><p>this demarche:  Jordan\'s policy would not change.  Convoking </p><p>of the Ambassador, and the new stronger GOJ statements of </p><p>concern for civilian casualties and calls for a quick end to </p><p>the war, are part of a campaign to show Jordanians that their </p><p>government is taking steps to address their concern about </p><p>Iraqis.  Accordingly, following the meeting the GOJ issued a </p><p>statement that the Ambassador had been convoked to hear the </p><p>GOJ\'s strong views (ref b). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
