THE SAME RACISTS WHO </p><p>   HAVE ALWAYS SEEN BLACKS AS SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS </p><p>   WERE DURING THE ELECTION TRYING HARD TO JOIN HANDS </p><p>   WITH BLACKS, SOMETHING THEY HAVE RESISTED FOR A </p><p>   LONG TIME.  WHAT HAS CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY TO SEE </p><p>   WHITE PEOPLE NOT ONLY STANDING IN LONG QUEUES TO </p><p>   VOTE BUT TRYING TO COERCE OTHER PEOPLE INTO VOTING </p><p>   FOR THE OPPOSITION MDC?  THE ANSWER IS ALL TOO </p><p>   OBVIOUS.  THEY ARE ONLY PARTICIPATING IN NATIONAL </p><p>   POLITICS TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS.  THEY WANT TO </p><p>   HANG ON TO THE VAST FARMS WHILE BLACKS REMAIN </p><p>   CRAMMED ON SMALL PIECES OF FRAGILE LAND. . .  THE </p><p>   WATERSHED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PROVIDED </p><p>   ZIMBABWEANS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE A LEADER </p><p>   WHO WILL GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL RECLAIM THEIR </p><p>   BIRTHRIGHT.  PRESIDENT MUGABE THROUGHOUT HIS </p><p>   CAMPAIGN PERIOD TOLD THE PEOPLE THAT LAND WILL BE </p><p>   EQUITABLY REDISTRIBUTED FOR ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE </p><p>   TO BE COMPLETE.  THE MDC, FUNDED BY WHITES AND </p><p>   WESTERN BACKERS, ON THE OTHER HAND WANTS TO RETURN </p><p>   ACQUIRED LAND TO WHITE PEOPLE, HENCE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00666  01 OF 02  140606Z </p><p>   DETERMINATION BY WHITE PEOPLE TO SEE THAT THEIR </p><p>   PARTY WINS.  THEY ARE IN FOR A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT </p><p>   AS THEIR NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES INFURIATED THE </p><p>   MAJORITY OF VOTERS.  THEIR PUPPET WILL NOT WIN." </p><p> </p><p>3.   UNDER HEADLINE "WIDENING RURAL-URBAN GAP AN EVIL </p><p>   POLITICAL PLOY," THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY </p><p>   NEWS"  (03/12) COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .ZANU PF HAS TRIED FOR MANY YEARS TO CURRY </p><p>   FAVOR WITH THE RURAL FOLK BY PUBLICLY DEMEANING THE </p><p>   URBAN DWELLER, GOING TO THE EXTENT OF ACCUSING THEM </p><p>   OF HAVING CONTRIBUTED FAR LESS TO THE LIBERATION </p><p>   STRUGGLE THAN THE RURAL FOLK.  THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>   ACHIEVE THIS CAME WITH THE CHAOTIC LAND REFORM </p><p>   PROGRAM WITH WHICH THE PARTY SEEMS DETERMINED TO </p><p>   TURN THE COUNTRY INTO ONE VAST VILLAGE.  FOR THAT, </p><p>   ZANU PF EXPECTS THE RURAL FOLK TO REWARD IT WITH A </p><p>   RESOUNDING VOTE FOR ITS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, </p><p>   ROBERT MUGABE.  BY THE DUBIOUS CALCULATIONS OF THE </p><p>   PARTY POLLSTERS, MUGABE WILL WIN BECAUSE THERE ARE </p><p>   MORE REGISTERED VOTERS IN THE RURAL AREAS THAN IN </p><p>   THE URBAN AREAS.  THE THEORY IS THAT BECAUSE ZANU </p><p>   PF HAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED THE RURAL AREAS ITS </p><p>   BEDROCK OF SUPPORT, MUGABE IS AS GOOD AS HOME AND </p><p>   DRY. . .  IT WOULD BE VERY DISTURBING IF THE RURAL </p><p>   FOLK FELT THEY OWED MUGABE THE VOTE BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>   LAND REFORM PROGRAM.  WE DOUBT THAT THEY COULD BE </p><p>   SO SIMPLE MINDED. . .  ZANU PF\'S ALMOST EVIL DESIGN </p><p>   IS TO DIVIDE THE PEOPLE ALONG THEIR SOCIAL STATUS, </p><p>   TO HAVE THE RURAL FOLK DESPISE THEIR URBAN COUSINS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00666  01 OF 02  140606Z </p><p>   AS PUPPETS OF TONY BLAIR, THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS, </p><p>   THE TRADE UNIONS AND THE MDC.  YET THE TRUTH, WHICH </p><p>   WE KNOW THE RURAL FOLK ARE AWARE OF, IS THAT ZANU </p><p>   PF HAS FAILED TO DEVELOP THIS COUNTRY, INCLUDING </p><p>   THE RURAL AREAS, TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL.  NOW IT IS </p><p>   USING MURDER, RAPE AND VIOLENCE TO INTIMIDATE THE </p><p>   PEOPLE INTO VOTING FOR IT.  AS ONE, THE PEOPLE ARE </p><p>   BOUND TO REJECT THIS PARTY OF VIOLENCE AND LIES. </p><p>   IF ZANU PF ATTEMPTS TO STEAL THE ELECTION, ALL THE </p><p>   PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE RURAL FOLK, CANNOT POSSIBLY </p><p>   STAND IDLY BY." </p><p> </p><p>4.

IN FACT THE EU AND </p><p>   THEIR COUSINS IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE BEEN </p><p>   TRYING TO TELL THE VOTING PUBLIC NOT TO VOTE FOR A </p><p>   LEADER OF THEIR CHOICE.
