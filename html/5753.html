(SBU) Summary:  Honduras remains an extremely poor </p><p>country, still trying to recover from the devastation of </p><p>Hurricane Mitch.  While most USG-funded post-Mitch </p><p>reconstruction efforts are complete, serious long-term </p><p>challenges make the situation extremely difficult for the </p><p>average Honduran.  Honduras is struggling to provide economic </p><p>opportunities, health care, housing, and schooling for its </p><p>current residents, and possibly another approximately 87,000 </p><p>that might return if Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is not </p><p>extended.  A decision not to extend TPS would be seen as a </p><p>serious blow to the Maduro administration and would make </p><p>achieving USG goals in Honduras on a range of issues much </p><p>more difficult.  Therefore, the State/AID country team </p><p>members unanimously endorse a Department recommendation to </p><p>the Attorney General that TPS be extended.  Post also </p><p>recommends that Washington give consideration to the desired </p><p>end game of TPS, since what was designed as a temporary </p><p>program is now viewed by Hondurans as an annual process in </p><p>which a decision not to extend TPS would be a shock.  The </p><p>eventual ending of the program, without some final </p><p>clarification of TPS beneficiaries\' immigration status, could </p><p>put a large category of people into legal no-man\'s land and </p><p>undermine USG efforts to better control our borders.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) With the help of the international donor community (of </p><p>which USAID is the largest bilateral contributor), Honduras </p><p>has largely recovered from the physical devastation of </p><p>Hurricane Mitch and has begun to focus its efforts on the </p><p>country\'s long-term development.  USAID\'s two-and-a-half </p><p>year, USD 300 million recovery program focused on a wide </p><p>variety of reconstruction interventions in the areas of </p><p>education, housing, water and sanitation, rural roads and </p><p>bridges, disaster mitigation, health, agriculture </p><p>reactivation, credit, accountability, and transparency. </p><p>Although the majority of this program has been brought to </p><p>completion, two ongoing programs remain to be completed: one </p><p>dealing with transparency and accountability, and the other </p><p>the reconstruction of damaged urban water and sanitation </p><p>systems - both of which are scheduled to be fully completed </p><p>in FY04.  Despite the gains made in post-Mitch recovery, </p><p>Honduras continues to face daunting long-term development </p><p>challenges that will continue to stress its limited resources. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) President Ricardo Maduro, upon assuming office in </p><p>January 2002, inherited a stagnating economy and seriously </p><p>deteriorated government finances from the previous </p><p>government.  One year into his Administration, the economic </p><p>situation is still bleak, with the GOH struggling to reach a </p><p>deal with the IMF.  The necessary, but difficult, measures </p><p>that the GOH is planning to take to achieve an IMF agreement </p><p>will likely result in economic and political problems in the </p><p>short-term, although they are necessary for long-term </p><p>macroeconomic stability.  The economy is growing slowly </p><p>(estimated real GDP growth of two percent in 2002), and </p><p>Honduras is a Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC), with a per </p><p>capita income of only USD 922 per year.  Low world coffee </p><p>prices continue to undermine the economy in rural areas. </p><p>Given this bleak economic situation, the GOH has been unable </p><p>to provide sufficient economic opportunities, health care, </p><p>housing, and schooling for the people of Honduras.  The </p><p>result can be seen in high crime rates and the slow </p><p>unraveling of the social fabric of the nation.  Maduro\'s team </p><p>is hoping that a U.S.-Central American Free Trade Agreement </p><p>(CAFTA) will serve as a catalyst to regional economic </p><p>cooperation, foreign investment, and economic growth. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Remittances from Hondurans living overseas continue to </p><p>grow rapidly (up 38 percent in the first six months of 2002) </p><p>and have become the country\'s most important source of </p><p>foreign exchange.  Post estimates that Hondurans in the U.S. </p><p>sent approximately USD 550-600 million in 2002 in remittances </p><p>to Honduras.  Any significant drop in remittance income, </p><p>something likely to happen if Temporary Protected Status </p><p>(TPS) is not extended, would cut the country\'s largest source </p><p>of foreign exchange. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Post estimates that Honduras is currently receiving </p><p>upwards of 10,400 deportees a year via the INS/JPATS </p><p>deportation program, a manageable number.  In addition, the </p><p>GOH receives assistance from the International Organization </p><p>of Migration (IOM) for a reinsertion program.  Post suspects </p><p>that many of these deportees attempt to return to the U.S. </p><p>again illegally and thus it is unclear how many are actually </p><p>remaining in Honduras.  An increase from what is currently </p><p>the second highest number of deportees in Central America </p><p>(after El Salvador) to a much higher number would be </p><p>difficult for Honduras to handle. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) There is deep appreciation in Honduras, especially </p><p>among members of the Maduro administration, for the USG\'s </p><p>2002 extension of TPS, and continual interest in possible </p><p>U.S. congressional action on the pending Nicaraguan </p><p>Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), which </p><p>would give immigration parity for Hondurans.  The wait for a </p><p>possible extension of TPS, and GOH advocacy for such a step, </p><p>has become an annual event, and TPS extension is supported </p><p>equally by both the National and Liberal Parties. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) President Ricardo Maduro\'s government is engaged on </p><p>the key issues of improving the administration of justice and </p><p>rule of law, and is seeking to transform Honduras so that law </p><p>and order can be restored and economic growth ignited. </p><p>Maduro has spoken out strongly on tackling corruption, but </p><p>has yet to deliver concrete results.  He faces formidable </p><p>challenges from entrenched economic and political interests </p><p>in moving his agenda forward.  Notably, the President\'s </p><p>popularity has remained stalled at a low point since June </p><p>2002.  A decision by the USG not to extend TPS could be </p><p>interpreted here by many as a sign of U.S. withdrawal of </p><p>support which would be a serious blow to the Maduro </p><p>administration.  In any case, it would make achieving USG </p><p>goals in Honduras, including Honduran congressional passage </p><p>of CAFTA next year, on a range of issues much more difficult. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In sum, Post believes the following three problems </p><p>are the most serious difficulties Honduras would face if TPS </p><p>is not extended and a substantial number of Hondurans </p><p>previously on TPS were to return to Honduras: </p><p>-- great difficulty providing jobs, housing, schooling, and </p><p>health care for those who return, resulting in additional </p><p>crime and social instability, </p><p>-- a significant loss of remittances, and </p><p>-- a loss of political support for President Maduro, which </p><p>would hurt USG goals in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation: Extend TPS and Plan for the End Game </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Because of the situation outlined above, State/AID </p><p>Country Team members unanimously endorse a Department </p><p>recommendation to the Attorney General that TPS be extended. </p><p>Post also recommends that Washington give consideration to </p><p>the end game of TPS, since what was designed as a temporary </p><p>program is currently seen by Hondurans as anything but </p><p>temporary.  Given the high levels of poverty and slow </p><p>economic growth in Honduras, there are likely to be good </p><p>reasons to argue for the extension of TPS for the foreseeable </p><p>future.  Whether it is an Executive Branch policy, such as </p><p>Deferred Enforced Departure (ref c), Congressional action on </p><p>NACARA-parity legislation, or some other solution, the USG </p><p>should plan for an ordered end to TPS.  The alternative, in </p><p>which TPS eventually ends and 87,000 people are suddenly </p><p>illegally in the U.S., could provide serious challenges to </p><p>the USG. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
