<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001311 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI, Media and Communications, Parliamentary Affairs </p><p>SUBJECT: PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES EXERT INFLUENCE OVER </p><p>AMENDMENTS BUT RESTRICTIONS ON PRESS REMAIN </p><p> </p><p> Summary </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Amendments to three bills were considered by </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s Parliament June 12.   Adverse reports were issued </p><p>on each amendment by the Parliamentary Legal Committee (PLC). </p><p> Two bills passed without objection on June 12 after </p><p>compromises were made prior to the amendments reaching the </p><p>floor. The third bill, contrary to reports in local papers, </p><p>was withdrawn.   In spite of the changes, the Media Institute </p><p>of Southern Africa has expressed concerns about the amendment </p><p>to the law on Access to Information and Protection of Privacy </p><p>(AIPP) arguing that it is too vague and allows GOZ law </p><p>enforcement agencies too wide a latitude to prosecute alleged </p><p>offenders.  The good news is that parliamentary committees </p><p>are working behind the scenes and forcing debate on </p><p>amendments and the ruling party is now responding to adverse </p><p>reports. </p><p> </p><p>Parliament Meets to amend three bills </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU)  For some time Parliament has been considering </p><p>amendments to three laws.  These laws are: Customary Law and </p><p>Local Courts, Citizenship and, the most controversial, Access </p><p>to Information and Protection of Privacy.  USAID officers </p><p>learned that the PLC had issued adverse reports on each but </p><p>that their major concerns were incorporated into the </p><p>amendments.  Unfortunately press reports on the subject </p><p>failed to mention that the PLC\'s objections were dealt with </p><p>in an earlier venue. </p><p> </p><p>Amendment One to Customary Law and Local Courts Passes </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>3. (SBU)  The purpose of the amendment to this law was not to </p><p>change the jurisdiction patterns of local courts which have </p><p>authority over customary law.  Rather it was intended to </p><p>allow these courts to enforce their judgments.  In the past, </p><p>once a local court made a decision, it was referred to the </p><p>Magistrate Court for enforcement where it was often delayed. </p><p>Now payments such as child maintenance, should be faster. </p><p>The PLC objected to the original amendment because it limited </p><p>the lifespan of a judgment to two years.  The Ministry agreed </p><p>with the PLC\'s proposal to do away with the limitation </p><p>altogether. </p><p> </p><p>Amendment Two to Citizenship Law Does Not Go Forward </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>4. (SBU)  The PLC issued an adverse report because the </p><p>amendment entitled farm workers who come from Zambia, Malawi </p><p>or Mozambique to register as citizens of Zimbabwe.  This </p><p>would have allowed them the privilege of citizenship based on </p><p>job description and origin which violates Section 23 of the </p><p>Constitution which states that no law shall discriminate </p><p>against any person on the grounds of that person\'s tribe, </p><p>race, place of origin, political views, color, religion or </p><p>sex.  Due to the objections of the PLC, the amendment did not </p><p>go forward though the government owned paper, the Herald, </p><p>reported that it had passed. </p><p> </p><p>Amendment Three to AIPP Passes - Media Watchdog Unhappy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Access to Information and Protection of Privacy </p><p>law passed last year with its restrictions on the media has </p><p>come in for substantial criticism from human rights and media </p><p>organizations.  The Amendment produced several months ago was </p><p>likewise controversial.  The PLC issued an adverse report and </p><p>as a result many of their recommendations were adopted.  The </p><p>most important of these were the deletion of the provision </p><p>criminalizing the writing of false stories and the provision </p><p>removing independent media organizations from the media </p><p>board.  In a press release issued June 14, the Media </p><p>Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) said that although "it </p><p>was reported that the concerns of the PLC had been addressed, </p><p>MISA-Zimbabwe notes that the passing of the bill does not </p><p>change much in making the law democratic....The law still </p><p>remains lethal in as far as it makes demands for the </p><p>accreditation of journalists and media houses respectively. </p><p>Access to information remains totally closed and much power </p><p>is vested in public officials."  MISA was particularly </p><p>disappointed  that the new amendment expanded the definition </p><p>of a journalist who must register with the Media and </p><p>Information Commission (MIC) to include a number of </p><p>publications and information that would not be normally </p><p>considered part of the mass media such as web pages or </p><p>organizations that distribute information on, for example, </p><p>HIV/AIDS.  Shortly after publication of the press release, </p><p>MISA itself was ordered to register with the MIC although its </p><p>publications are limited to newsletters for its members and </p><p>press releases. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6.  (SBU) During past years, parliamentary committees were </p><p>prohibited from meeting except when Parliament was in session </p><p>but the rule was changed this year and since then, there has </p><p>been a remarkable increase in the number of times the </p><p>committees have met.  Parliament has apparently begun to </p><p>recognize the value of these committees and the ruling </p><p>party\'s Chief Whip has said that ineffective committee chairs </p><p>will be replaced at the start of the new session in July. </p><p>Those on the chopping block are all ZANU-PF MPs who are on </p><p>the list to be removed for poor performance. (No MDC chairs </p><p>are up for replacement based on poor performance.)  When the </p><p>next session of Parliament opens in July, the quality of the </p><p>new chairs that ZANU appoints to head committees will reflect </p><p>the party\'s appreciation for the growing strength that </p><p>committees play in the legislative process. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Regarding the Access to Information bill, it </p><p>appears that serious concerns articulated by Parliament were </p><p>addressed, but that the legislation maintains other features </p><p>which restrict and impose government control on the media. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
