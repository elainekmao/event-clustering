<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY APRIL 7: FIRST T-BILL AUCTION OF </p><p>WEEK GOES WELL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  On April 7, Treasury raised $844 million </p><p>in the first of three T-bill auctions scheduled for April </p><p>7-8.  Treasury\'s target is to raise a total of $3 billion </p><p>ahead of $3.2 billion in debt service payments on April 9. </p><p>Today\'s auction results came in at market expectations; the </p><p>major focus will be on the one-year bond to be auctioned </p><p>tomorrow.  Markets expect rates to remain in the 62/63 </p><p>percent range in that auction, declining to about 60 percent </p><p>in the secondary market.   MinState Babacan\'s April 6 </p><p>announcement that the LOI had been signed, and the IMF </p><p>announcement of an April 18 board date, were well received. </p><p>Markets also welcomed the news that the Fourth Review </p><p>disbursement had been reduced, and that more IMF reviews had </p><p>been added, indicating to commentators here that the IMF </p><p>shares their view that this government needs the extra </p><p>supervision.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Agree with Revised IMF </p><p>Disbursement Schedule </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On April 7 am, Turkish markets were pleased with </p><p>MinState\'s April 6 announcement that the IMF letter of intent </p><p>had been signed, and with the IMF announcement of an April 18 </p><p>board date for the Fourth Review.   The lira appreciated </p><p>slightly to TL 1,650,000 (from TL 1,656,000 at Friday\'s </p><p>close); T-bill yields were slightly lower at 62.5 percent </p><p>(from 63 percent on Friday); the Istanbul Stock Exchange was </p><p>up 2 percent in morning trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Markets greeted news of the revised IMF </p><p>disbursement schedule, which reduced the Fourth Review </p><p>tranche from $1.6 billion to about $660 million, and which </p><p>added reviews during 2003 and 2004 (details at para 8.)   As </p><p>Yapi Kredi Treasurer Imece told us, "The IMF confirms the </p><p>market\'s view that there\'s no reason to trust this </p><p>government." Hurriyet columnist Erdal Saglam wrote in his </p><p>April 7 column that the IMF had tried to reduce the Fourth </p><p>Review to $300 million, but raised it at GOT insistence. </p><p>Saglam\'s column also applauds the IMF move to increase the </p><p>frequency of reviews. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Successful Four-Month T-bill Auction </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On April 7, Turkish Treasury raised TL 1.393 </p><p>quadrillion ($844 million) by auctioning a four-month T-bill. </p><p> The interest rate was  56.5 percent in annual, compounded </p><p>terms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Today\'s auction is the first of three T-bill auctions </p><p>this week. On Tuesday April 8, Treasury will auction two </p><p>longer dated papers:  a six-month bill (October 8 maturity); </p><p>and a one-year bond (April 28, 2004 maturity).  Treasury\'s </p><p>target is to raise TL 5 quadrillion ($3 billion) in these </p><p>three auctions, per Treasury\'s Volkan Taskin, ahead of </p><p>Wednesday\'s TL 5.3 quadrillion ($3.2 billion) in debt service. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) According to banking sector contacts, Turkish banks </p><p>bought today\'s four-month bill largely for their retail </p><p>customers, and will look at tomorrow\'s auctions, especially </p><p>the one-year bond, for their own investment portfolios. </p><p>Interest rates on the one-year bond are expected to remain </p><p>62-63 percent at the auction, but then declining to the 60 </p><p>percent range in the secondary market.  Treasury offered the </p><p>six-month bill, trying to limit the duration of the current </p><p>relatively high rates, but investors told us they expect </p><p>little demand for that paper. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Highlights of the April 6 Babacan Press Conference </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) State Minister Babacan held a televised press </p><p>conference on Sunday afternoon April 6 to announce signing of </p><p>the IMF letter of intent, and World Bank letters of </p><p>commitment (extending the Bank\'s Economic Reform and </p><p>Programmatic Public and Finance Sector Adjustment Loans).  TV </p><p>networks only partially covered his conference, cutting away </p><p>to a meeting of PM Erdogan in Istanbul.  Highlights from his </p><p>statement, as posted on Treasury\'s website in Turkish, </p><p>follow.  (Full text will be e-mailed to Washington agencies.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The 2003 budget will meet the 6.5 percent of GNP primary </p><p>surplus target, and we will implement the budget with </p><p>decisiveness.  In addition, in order to ameliorate the impact </p><p>on Turkey of the continuing war in Iraq, the Government has </p><p>taken measures to generate TL 4 quadrillion in cash, which </p><p>amounts to 1.2 percent of GNP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The primary surplus realized at year-end 2002 was 4 </p><p>percent of GNP because of loose fiscal policies in the second </p><p>half of the year.   This required taking additional </p><p>tightening measures to meet the 6.5 percent target in 2003. </p><p>All measures add to TL 15.8 quadrillion.  The primary surplus </p><p>realizations in the first two months exceeded our targets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The primary surplus target is important for increasing </p><p>confidence in the Government\'s reform program, and it also </p><p>helps to decrease the net public sector debt to GNP ratio. </p><p>This ratio has declined from 92 percent at year-end 2001 to </p><p>79.6 percent at year-end 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  State Economic Enterprises - Excess Employment: </p><p>Originally an excess of 45,800 positions was identified in </p><p>the state economic enterprises.  As of January 2003, this </p><p>excess was decreased by 20,718 through retirement.  We will </p><p>fully resolve this problem by year-end. A legal arrangement </p><p>to strengthen SEE management will be implemented before </p><p>end-June this year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Privatization:  The Council of Ministers will adopt a </p><p>privatization plan for Turk Telekom by end April.  The High </p><p>Privatization Council will adopt a privatization calendar for </p><p>the sugar refineries by end June.  Work continues to </p><p>liberalize the energy sector, leading to free competition </p><p>through market mechanisms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  State Banks.  Ziraat and Halk will not make any subsidies </p><p>without a budget allocation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Improving the Business Environment:  A draft law on </p><p>direct foreign investment, currently in the parliament, is </p><p>expected to be adopted by end April. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Local press also released details of the revised IMF </p><p>Stand-By Disbursement schedule.   Following the $660 million </p><p>in the Fourth Review (board date of April 18), the IMF is </p><p>planning seven further reviews over the next 20 months, each </p><p>with about $500 million.  The Fifth and Sixth Reviews will be </p><p>bi-monthly (staff missions in late May and late July), to be </p><p>followed by quarterly reviews starting with the Seventh </p><p>(staff mission tentatively in late October). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Uzans, but No Foreigners, Bid on PETKIM </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) On April 4, the Privatization Administration </p><p>announced that five firms had bid on PETKIM, the state </p><p>petrochemical monopoly that is the first large privatization </p><p>of the year.  There were no foreign bidders, despite PA hopes </p><p>for bids from Russian oil and gas giants Lukoil and Gazprom. </p><p>Among the five bidders were two prominent Turkish exporters - </p><p>Zorlu (Vestel TV screens) and Sanko (textiles), one state </p><p>bank (Vakif), and two relatively petrochemical traders </p><p>Standard Chemical and Chemorbis.  Standard Chemical is owned </p><p>by the Uzan family, of Motorola infamy. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
