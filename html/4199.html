<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003016 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY. PLEASE PASS TO AF A/S KASTEINER AND </p><p>AMBASSADOR JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MOD DANJUMA ON THE OBASANJO-ATIKU-IBB </p><p>NEXUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During an October 25 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Nigerian Minister of Defense Lieutenant </p><p>General (ret.) Theophilus Y. Danjuma discussed the current </p><p>state of Nigerian politics.  Danjuma spoke at length of the </p><p>tense relationship between President Obasanjo, Vice </p><p>President Atiku and former military Head of State Ibrahim </p><p>Babangida, saying IBB was playing Atiku for a fool as he </p><p>worked to drive a wedge between the President and Vice </p><p>President.  Commenting on National Security Advisor Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed\'s loyalties, Danjuma said President Obasanjo is </p><p>aware of the NSA\'s disloyalty, but he chooses to keep him </p><p>close rather than have him publicly join "the other team". </p><p>Finally, Danjuma dismissed the so-called "Patriots\'" plan </p><p>to limit office holders to single five-year terms as </p><p>simplistic and unrealistic.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During an October 25 private MOD office </p><p>conversation with Ambassador Jeter, Minister of Defense </p><p>Lieutenant General (ret.) Theophilus Y. Danjuma discussed </p><p>his views on the relationship between President Obasanjo </p><p>and Vice President Atiku and the manipulation of both by </p><p>former military Head of State Ibrahim Babangida.  According </p><p>to Danjuma, IBB has been painstakingly pursuing a strategy </p><p>to divide and conquer Obasanjo and Atiku for over a year. </p><p>IBB first tried to persuade Obasanjo to dump Atiku by </p><p>hinting that releasing the Vice President would ease the </p><p>President\'s "image problem" in the North.  After nine </p><p>months of failing to convince Obasanjo to eject Atiku, IBB </p><p>decided to focus on manipulating Atiku. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) According to Danjuma, IBB has hoodwinked Atiku, who </p><p>now believes he has IBB\'s support.  Noting that IBB once </p><p>fired Atiku from his job as head of customs because of </p><p>rumored links with "drug barons" and that he considers the </p><p>Vice President to be "lazy and corrupt," Danjuma said he </p><p>thought Atiku had been blinded by his own ambition. </p><p>"Babangida is singing a song he (Atiku) wants to hear." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Danjuma asserted that as part of his plan to weaken </p><p>Obasanjo, Atiku planted the "Mandela Option" stories in the </p><p>Nigerian press leading to calls for the President to step </p><p>down after his first term in order to cement the transition </p><p>to democracy.  Danjuma sees this as playing right into </p><p>IBB\'s hands.  If Obasanjo can be convinced not to run, </p><p>Atiku would represent an easy opponent for IBB or his </p><p>surrogate.  If Obasanjo stays in the race, Danjuma said the </p><p>notoriously tight-fisted President would need to spend far </p><p>more money to insure his victory in the PDP primary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) As the conversation turned to the plans and </p><p>prospects of National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed, </p><p>Danjuma said the former general had been campaigning </p><p>against Obasanjo for over a year and that Obasanjo was well </p><p>aware of Mohammed\'s transgression.  Danjuma noted that </p><p>after Obasanjo learned of Aliyu\'s attendance at a September </p><p>meeting where Atiku gave House leaders the green light for </p><p>Obasanjo\'s impeachment, the President called the NSA about </p><p>his lack of support.  Danjuma characterized Obasanjo as </p><p>exceedingly tolerant of Mohammed.  He believed Obasanjo had </p><p>decided it was better to keep Mohammed close rather than to </p><p>fire him and have him publicly side with his opponents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Finally, Danjuma rejected the proposal put forward </p><p>by the group of prominent old-guard and predominantly </p><p>Southern and Middle Belt politicians known as "The </p><p>Patriots" that elected officials serve single five-year </p><p>terms.  He characterized the group as "senile and </p><p>mischievous old men" and stated that their plan was </p><p>unrealistic in Nigeria\'s political environment, as someone </p><p>would surely find an excuse to extend the terms further at </p><p>the end of the fifth year. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
