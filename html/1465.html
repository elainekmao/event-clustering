IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ON DECEMBER 21, PRESIDENT MUGABE EXPANDED THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE HIGH COURT BY SWEARING IN FOUR NEW JUSTICES. </p><p>THREE OF THE NEW JUSTICES HAVE CLEAR TIES TO THE RULING </p><p>ZANU-PF.  RITA MAKARAU IS A FORMER NON-CONSTITUENCY MP </p><p>APPOINTED BY MUGABE AND SERVED IN THE LAST PARLIAMENT. </p><p>SHE WAS ALSO APPOINTED TO SERVE ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION, WHICH LAST YEAR HIJACKED THE </p><p>BROAD-BASED NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S EFFORT TO </p><p>WRITE A NEW CONSTITUTION.  CHARLES HUNGWE WAS THE FIRST </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE ZIMBABWE NATIONAL LIBERATION WAR </p><p>VETERANS\' ASSOCIATION FROM 1992 TO 1995, AND WAS A </p><p>SENIOR MAGISTRATE BEFORE HIS HIGH COURT APPOINTMENT.  HE </p><p>IS CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY </p><p>COMMISSION, AND IS EXPECTED TO RESIGN FROM THAT POST TO </p><p>TAKE UP HIS NEW POSITION.  BEN HLATSHWAYO, ALSO A MEMBER </p><p>OF THE NOW-DEFUNCT CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION, HAS BEEN A </p><p>STAUNCH CRITIC OF THE NCA, AND HE IS CURRENTLY AN </p><p>EDITORIAL ADVISOR TO THE PRO-ZANU-PF "ZIMBABWE MIRROR." </p><p>ANNE-MARIE GOWORA COMES FROM A PRIVATE LAW FIRM, AND </p><p>ONCE WORKED FOR THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL\'S OFFICE.  IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR WHERE HER POLITICAL LEANINGS LIE.  THE </p><p>APPOINTMENTS EXPAND THE HARARE HIGH COURT FROM 15 TO 19 </p><p>JUSTICES.  THE SIZE OF THE BULAWAYO HIGH COURT REMAINS </p><p>UNCHANGED AT FOUR JUSTICES. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07285  291134Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BRIAN RAFTOPOULOS, A RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE, TOLD THE EMBASSY THAT MUGABE\'S </p><p>APPOINTEES ARE INDEED CLOSE TO THE RULING PARTY, BUT NOT </p><p>SO CLOSE THAT THEY CAN BE CALLED ZANU-PF PUPPETS. </p><p>MUGABE WANTS CREDIBLE AND COMPETENT PEOPLE ON THE COURT, </p><p>RAFTOPOULOS OFFERED, TO AT LEAST PRESERVE SOME </p><p>APPEARANCE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.  HIGH COURT </p><p>JUSTICESHIPS ARE NOT "STRAIGHTFORWARD PATRONAGE </p><p>POSITIONS," THE RESEARCH FELLOW CONTINUED, BECAUSE </p><p>JUSTICES EXERCISE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF AUTONOMY IN </p><p>THEIR RULINGS.  THE JUDICIAL SERVICE COMMISSION, HEADED </p><p>BY THE STAUNCHLY INDEPENDENT SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>ANTHONY GUBBAY, HAD TO APPROVE THE NOMINEES, WHICH ALSO </p><p>LENDS SOME CREDIBILITY TO THE APPOINTMENTS.  (COMMENT: </p><p>RECENTLY APPOINTED TO THE JUDICIAL SERVICE COMMISSION </p><p>WERE TWO VERY PRO-ZANU-PF MEMBERS GODFREY CHIDIYASIKU-- </p><p>THE HIGH COURT JUDGE PRESIDENT--AND CANAAN DUBE.  IN </p><p>ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT VITIATING THE GATEKEEPER POINT OF THE </p><p>JUDICIARY\'S INDEPENDENCE, THE COMMISSION CONTRACT OF BOB </p><p>STUMBLES--OUR EMBASSY LAWYER, AND WIDELY RESPECTED IN </p><p>THE LEGAL FIELD--WAS NOT RENEWED BY MUGABE.  END </p><p>COMMENT.)  NONETHELESS, THE APPOINTMENTS REFLECT </p><p>MUGABE\'S ONGOING, LONG-TERM PLAN TO TURN THE JUDICIARY </p><p>INTO AN ARM OF GOVERNMENT MORE PLIABLE TO ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>WISHES, RAFTOPOULOS BELIEVES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: MUGABE\'S EXPANSION OF THE HIGH COURT </p><p>WITH JUSTICES HAVING STRONG TIES TO THE RULING PARTY </p><p>UNDERMINES THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, IN </p><p>OUR VIEW.  RAFTOPOULOS IS CORRECT IN THAT THE NEW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07285  291134Z </p><p>JUSTICES HAVE STRONG LEGAL CREDENTIALS, AND MUGABE\'S </p><p>ATTENTION TO THEIR CREDIBILITY SHOWS THAT THE PRESIDENT </p><p>STILL CARES ABOUT MAINTAINING A FACADE OF LEGALITY FOR </p><p>HIS PARTY\'S ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, THE JUDGE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE HIGH COURT IS AN AFFIRMED ZANU-PF LOYALIST, AND, </p><p>WITH A LARGER BENCH MORE AMENABLE TO HIS PARTY\'S CAUSES, </p><p>HE WILL HAVE MORE OPTIONS IN ASSIGNING CASES WHEN THEY </p><p>COME BEFORE THE HIGH COURT.  THE COURT HAS BEEN </p><p>ESPECIALLY ACTIVE IN ADJUDICATING CLAIMS OF COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS DENIED DUE PROCESS IN THE SEIZURE OF THEIR LAND. </p><p>MUCH OF THIS ACTIVISM, IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>INTERPRETATION, COULD BE STOPPED COLD WHEN THE COURT </p><p>RESUMES ITS SESSION NEXT MONTH.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
