KABILA ASSASSINATION TRIAL SCENESETTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KINSHASA 640 </p><p>     B. 2001 KINSHASA 02939 </p><p>     C. 2001 BRUSSELS 05930 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF LAURA ENGELBRECHT, REASONS 1.5 B & D </p><p> </p><p>1.    (C) SUMMARY:  THE LONG-AWAITED TRIAL OF THE 116 </p><p>SUSPECTS IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE LATE PRESIDENT LAURENT </p><p>DESIRE KABILA BEGAN ON THE MORNING OF APRIL 3.  ON MARCH 20, </p><p>THE GENERAL PROSECUTOR PUBLICLY READ THE CHARGES (IN THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF THE DEFENDANTS, THEIR LAWYERS, AND THE PUBLIC) AT </p><p>MAKALA PRISON.  SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE DEFENDANTS (EDDY KAPEND, </p><p>GENERAL YAV, RASHIDI\'S WIDOW, THE MASASU GROUP) GENERATED THE </p><p>MOST INTEREST.  OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THE U.S., FORMER </p><p>ANR CHIEF LETA MANGASA IS CHARGED WITH BEING IN SECRET </p><p>CONTACT WITH THE CIA STATION CHIEF IN KINSHASA BETWEEN JULY </p><p>2000 AND JANUARY 16, 2001, IN ORDER TO "FAVOR UNDERTAKINGS OF </p><p>THE (U.S.), NOTABLY SUPPORT TO REBEL FORCES AGAINST THE DRC." </p><p> FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS AND DUE PROCESS PERSPECTIVE, THE LDK </p><p>ASSASSINATION TRIAL IS DEEPLY FLAWED.  NEVERTHELESS, THAT THE </p><p>TRIAL IS FINALLY BEGINNING, IS AN IMPROVEMENT ON INDEFINITE </p><p>INCARCERATION.  SEPTEL WILL REPORT DEVELOPMENTS AS THE TRIAL </p><p>PROGRESSES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GENERAL INFO ABOUT THE CHARGES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.    (U)  ON MARCH 20, GENERAL PROSECUTOR COLONEL CHARLES </p><p>ALAMBA MUNGAKO FORMALLY PRESENTED WRITTEN CHARGES AGAINST 116 </p><p>SUSPECTS WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED FOR OVER A YEAR IN RELATION </p><p>TO THE ASSASSINATION OF LAURENT DESIRE KABILA,(REPORTED REF </p><p>A).  (NOTE:  THE COURT ANNOUNCED THERE WERE 135 DEFENDANTS, </p><p>BUT HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS AND LAWYERS SAY THE LIST DUPLICATES </p><p>SEVERAL PEOPLE, AND THEY BELIEVE THERE ARE ACTUALLY ONLY 116 </p><p>INDIVIDUALS.)  OF THE 116 DEFENDANTS, MOST ARE FROM THE </p><p>MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  AN NGO CONTACT COUNTED </p><p>16 CIVILIANS.  THE TRIAL BEGINS APRIL 3 UNDER THE </p><p>JURISDICTION OF THE MILITARY COURT (COM), WITH GENERAL NAWEL </p><p>MUKONGO AS THE PRESIDING JUDGE ("PRESIDENT OF THE COURT"). </p><p>AFTER BEING DETAINED OVER A YEAR WITHOUT ACCESS TO LAWYERS </p><p>(ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALLOWED REGULAR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS VISITS), LAWYERS HAD ONLY TWO </p><p>WEEKS TO PREPARE THEIR CASES. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (U) IN ROUGHLY HALF OF THE CASES, CHARGES WERE MADE ON </p><p>AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; THE REST OF THE DEFENDANTS WERE CHARGED </p><p>IN A GROUP OF 40 AND A GROUP OF 19.  IN GENERAL, THE CHARGES </p><p>WERE QUITE REPETITIVE.  SOME OF THE MOST COMMON WERE: 1) </p><p>ABANDONMENT OF POST (FOR THE BODYGUARDS AND SOLDIERS), 2) </p><p>PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OR FAILURE TO INFORM THE PRESIDENT OF A PLOT </p><p>(ANR/NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FIGURES), 3) FACILITATION </p><p>OF THE ESCAPE OF KEY DEFENDANTS, 4) KILLING OF ASSASSINATION </p><p>SUSPECTS, AND 5) MEMBERSHIP IN THE MASASU GROUP (SEE PARA 5). </p><p> </p><p>SOME OF THE KEY PLAYERS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AS REPORTED IN REFTELS B AND C, THERE ARE SEVERAL </p><p>THEORIES AS TO THE IDENTITY AND MOTIVATION OF LDK\'S </p><p>ASSASSINATION PLOTTERS.  WITHOUT DELVING INTO THE VERACITY OF </p><p>THESE THEORIES, THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY PLAYERS WHO WILL </p><p>DOMINATE THE FOCUS OF THE TRIALS: </p><p> </p><p>-- RASHIDI\'S FAMILY:  RASHIDI MIZELE ALLEGEDLY KILLED </p><p>PRESIDENT KABILA, AND WAS ALLEGEDLY KILLED BY COLONEL EDDY </p><p>KAPEND.  RASHIDI\'S WIFE, LADY NABINTU, WAS ARRESTED AND HAS </p><p>BEEN IN JAIL WITH HER CHILD (NOW 2 YEARS OLD, SHE HAD A </p><p>SECOND CHILD WHILE IN JAIL) DURING THE PAST YEAR.  SHE IS </p><p>CHARGED AS A MEMBER OF THE MASASU GROUP.  HER LAWYER TOLD </p><p>POLOFF THAT THE 2-YEAR-OLD, AIME, WAS CLUBBED BY GLM SOLDIERS </p><p>AND SUFFERS FROM MENTAL PROBLEMS (HE IS REPORTEDLY </p><p>TRAUMATIZED WHENEVER HE SEES A SOLDIER IN UNIFORM). </p><p> </p><p>-- COLONEL EDDY KAPEND:  KAPEND WAS PRESIDENT KABILA\'S </p><p>PERSONAL BODYGUARD AND AIDE-DE-CAMP.  AFTER ALLEGEDLY KILLING </p><p>RASHIDI, KAPEND WENT ON NATIONAL TV TO URGE THE POPULATION TO </p><p>STAY CALM AND TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE ARMY\'S SENIOR </p><p>LEADERSHIP TO MOVE TROOPS TO SECURE THE AIRPORT, ETC... </p><p>KAPEND\'S ALLEGED KILLING OF RASHIDI RATHER THAN TAKING HIM </p><p>PRISONER, AND HIS "TAKE-OVER" BEHAVIOR AFTER LDK\'S DEATH, HAS </p><p>FED THE SPECULATION THAT KAPEND WAS IN COLLUSION WITH </p><p>RASHIDI.  KAPEND IS REPRESENTED BY SEVERAL LAWYERS.  HE IS </p><p>FACES MANY CHARGES, INCLUDING KILLING RASHIDI AND GIVING </p><p>ORDERS TO HIS MILITARY SUPERIORS (REFERENCE TO HIS TV </p><p>APPEARANCES AND OTHER INSTRUCTIONS).  (NOTE: IT IS NOT CLEAR </p><p>IF KAPEND IS CHARGED WITH TREASON BY REASON OF ATTEMPTING A </p><p>COUP.  GIVING ORDERS TO S SUPERIOR IS HARDLY A SERIOUS </p><p>CRIMINAL ACT.) </p><p> </p><p>-- GENERAL YAV NAWEJ:  IN THE CONFUSION IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION, NAWEJ ALLEGEDLY ROUNDED UP AND EXECUTED 11 </p><p>LEBANESE SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE PLOT (THE CHARGES </p><p>ALLEGE THAT HE DID THIS ON ORDERS FROM KAPEND).  HE IS </p><p>CHARGED WITH MURDERING THE LEBANESE AND WITH OBEYING ORDERS </p><p>FROM KAPEND, A MORE JUNIOR OFFICER, PERHAPS AS A </p><p>CO-CONSPIRATOR IN KAPEND\'S ATTEMPTED COUP D\'ETAT. </p><p> </p><p>-- MAJOR KAMWANYA BORA, GEORGES MIRINDI, AND JOHN BAHATI: </p><p>MIRINDI AND BAHATI WERE CLOSE ASSOCIATES AND ALLEGED </p><p>CO-CONSPIRATORS OF RASHIDI (SEE REF B).  MAJOR BORA WAS A </p><p>CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF COMMANDANT MASASU.  ALL THREE ESCAPED </p><p>PRISON SOON AFTER THE ASSASSINATION AND ARE SAID TO BE IN </p><p>BELGIUM.  THE TWO WIVES OF MAJOR BORA, MASUMBUKO MWALI ANNE </p><p>MARIE AND KAMUANYA BEYA ROSETTE, HAVE BEEN IN PRISON THIS </p><p>LAST YEAR AND WERE CHARGED WITH FACILITATING THE ESCAPE OF </p><p>BORA BY BRIBING GUARDS.  (NOTE: POLOFF HAS HEARD REPORTS THAT </p><p>MIRINDI\'S AND/OR BAHATI\'S WIVES MAY ALSO IN PRISON, BUT THEY </p><p>ARE NOT DEFENDANTS IN THIS TRIAL.) </p><p> </p><p>-- NELLY TWITE: TWITE WAS PRESIDENT KABILA\'S PRIVATE </p><p>SECRETARY, AND ALLEGEDLY LETA\'S GIRLFRIEND.  SHE IS CHARGED </p><p>WITH FAILING TO INFORM THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF </p><p>AN ANR REPORT ON THREATS TO HIS SAFETY. </p><p> </p><p>THE MASASU GROUP </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMANDANT ANSELME MASASU WAS CONVICTED OF </p><p>COUP-PLOTTING AGAINST LAURENT KABILA AND EXECUTED ON NOVEMBER </p><p>24, 2000.  BEFORE THEIR FALLING OUT, MASASU WAS A FOUNDER OF </p><p>THE AFDL.  MASASU WAS A MUSHI (SINGULAR - PLURAL FOR THE </p><p>ETHNIC GROUP IS BASHI) FROM SOUTH KIVU.  HE HAD A FOLLOWING </p><p>IN THE ARMY AMONG THE BASHI AND THE "KADOGOS" (CHILD </p><p>SOLDIERS) HE RECRUITED FROM SOUTH KIVU.  AFTER HIS DEATH, </p><p>HUNDREDS OF KADOGOS WERE EXECUTED OR ARRESTED, AND IT IS </p><p>COMMONLY THOUGHT THAT LDK\'S ASSASSINATION WAS REVENGE OR </p><p>SIMPLY TO "FINISH THE JOB" MASASU ATTEMPTED UNSUCCESSFULLY </p><p>(REF B).  ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT LDK\'S </p><p>ASSASSINS HAD DIFFERENT MOTIVES (REF C) AND LITTLE OR NO </p><p>CONNECTION TO THE MASASU GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE DEFENDENTS INCLUDE TWO GROUPS THAT ARE CHARGED </p><p>GENERALLY WITH BEING PART OF THE MASASU GROUP: 1) A "GROUP OF </p><p>19" WHO ARE BASHI AND WERE AGENTS OF ANR IN SOUTH KIVU, AND </p><p>2) 39 PERSONS (MOSTLY BASHI OR FROM OTHER SOUTH KIVU ETHNIC </p><p>GROUPS) CHARGED VAGUELY WITH "CONNECTIONS TO GENERAL MASASU." </p><p> RASHIDI\'S WIDOW, LADY NABINTU, IS CHARGED WITH BEING IN </p><p>GENERAL MASASU\'S GROUP.  (NOTE: SINCE SHE IS MUSHI, THIS IS A </p><p>CONVENIENT CHARGE; THE COURT CANNOT LEGALLY HOLD HER SIMPLY </p><p>BECAUSE SHE WAS MARRIED TO LDK\'S ASSASSIN.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) CURIOUSLY, JOSEPH KABILA ALLEGEDLY MAINTAINS CONTACT </p><p>WITH THE MASASU FAMILY.  POLOFF MET WITH PERE ITOLO, AN </p><p>ITALIAN PRIEST AND LONG-TIME CONTACT OF THE ICRC.  APPARENTLY </p><p>THE MASASU FAMILY HAS BEEN PART OF PERE ITOLO\'S PARISH FOR </p><p>YEARS, AND HE HAS BEEN CARING FOR THEM SINCE COMMANDANT </p><p>MASASU\'S EXECUTION.  ITOLO TOLD POLOFF THAT JOSEPH KABILA AND </p><p>CMDT MASASU FOUGHT IN THE AFDL SIDE-BY-SIDE AND BEEN CLOSE </p><p>COMRADES; JOSEPH KABILA ALSO ALLEGEDLY HAD AN AFFAIR WITH </p><p>MASASU\'S SISTER.   PERE ITOLO GAVE POLOFF A DOCUMENT DATED </p><p>SEPTEMBER 17, 1998, SIGNED BY MAJOR GENERAL JOSEPH KABILA, </p><p>GIVING THE MASASU FAMILY THE RIGHT TO OCCUPY A HOUSE IN </p><p>KINSHASA THAT HAD BEEN SEIZED AS "BIENS MAL ACQUIS." </p><p>ACCORDING TO ITOLO, RELATIONS BETWEEN JOSEPH KABILA AND THE </p><p>MASASU FAMILY CONTINUED EVEN AFTER COMMANDANT MASASU\'S </p><p>EXECUTION.  ON JANUARY 8, 2002, THE MASASU FAMILY RECEIVED A </p><p>LETTER FROM THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR GIVING THEM PERMISSION </p><p>TO LEAVE KINSHASA AND RETURN TO BUKAVU (BY MONUC TRANSPORT). </p><p>ODDLY, THIS LETTER (WHICH WAS DATED OCTOBER 2, 2001) ARRIVED </p><p>TWO DAYS AFTER THE ARREST OF JUSTIN NINDAGA (THE BROTHER OF </p><p>MASASU), WHO IS STILL BEING HELD.  PERE ITOLO SAID THE FAMILY </p><p>WILL NOT LEAVE KINSHASA WITHOUT NINDAGA.  PERE ITOLO SAID </p><p>MASASU\'S MOTHER (CONSOLATE MUKUZO, AGED 51) DIED RECENTLY "OF </p><p>A BROKEN HEART" AND THAT JOSEPH KABILA PRIVATELY SENT $300 IN </p><p>CASH TO HELP PAY FOR HER FUNERAL. </p><p> </p><p>LETA - CHARGED WITH CONNECTION TO THE CIA </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) IN ANOTHER ODD TWIST, FORMER CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (ANR) LETA MANGASA WAS CHARGED WITH </p><p>VARIOUS CRIMES INVOLVING THE CIA.  THESE CHARGES HAVE SO FAR </p><p>RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE CONGOLESE PRESS.  THE </p><p>SECTIONS OF THE CHARGES RELATING TO THE U.S. ARE QUOTED AS </p><p>FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>LETA MANGASA IS CHARGED WITH ... </p><p> </p><p>-- "HAVING DIRECTLY CAUSED THE ATTACK COMMITTED AGAINST THE </p><p>LIFE OF THE HEAD OF STATE... NOTABLY BY REFRAINING FROM </p><p>COMMUNICATING TO THE HEAD OF STATE AS PART OF HIS DUTIES... </p><p>THE SYNTHESIS OF THE SECURITY SERVICE MEMOS RELATING TO </p><p>THREATS OF ATTACKS AGAINST HIS LIFE, RECEIVED FROM THE CIA </p><p>CHIEF OF STATION IN CENTRAL AFRICA RESIDING IN THE DRC." </p><p> </p><p>-- "HAVING MAINTAINED INTELLIGENCE WITH A FOREIGN POWER OR </p><p>WITH ITS AGENTS TO FAVOR DEEDS OF THE POWER AGAINST THE DRC. </p><p>IN THIS CASE, IN KINSHASA, ...IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN JULY 2000 </p><p>AND JANUARY 16, 2001, WHILE KNOWING THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE </p><p>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE AGGRESSION BEFALLING THE DRC, </p><p>MAINTAINED SECRET CONTACTS WITH THE CIA CHIEF OF STATION IN </p><p>CENTRAL AFRICA RESIDING IN KINSHASA TO FAVOR UNDERTAKINGS OF </p><p>THE POWER, NOTABLY SUPPORT TO REBEL FORCES AGAINST THE DRC." </p><p> </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ASPECTS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, THE TRIAL IS FINALLY GETTING </p><p>UNDER WAY.  IT IS OPEN TO THE PRESS AND OTHER OBSERVERS </p><p>(LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL).  THE DEFENDANTS HAVE ACCESS TO </p><p>LAWYERS AND THE CHARGES HAVE BEEN READ PUBLICLY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) HOWEVER, THE TRIAL IS FRAUGHT WITH DUE PROCESS </p><p>PROBLEMS.  SEVERAL CIVILIANS ARE BEING TRIED IN THE MILITARY </p><p>COURT SYSTEM (COM).  MOST PRISONERS WERE HELD WITHOUT CHARGES </p><p>IN HORRIBLE CONDITIONS AND WITHOUT ACCESS TO LAWYERS FOR OVER </p><p>A YEAR.  THE LAWYERS HAD ONLY TWO WEEKS TO PREPARE THEIR </p><p>CASES.  ONE OF EDDY KAPEND\'S LAWYERS REPORTED THAT </p><p>CONSULTATION OF HER CLIENT\'S FILES MUST TAKE PLACE IN </p><p>MILITARY PRESENCE AND UNDER THEIR CLOSE SCRUTINY.  THE "GROUP </p><p>CHARGES" AGAINST THOSE IN THE MASASU GROUP DO NOT AFFORD </p><p>INDIVIDUALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THEMSELVES INNOCENT. </p><p>FINALLY, THERE IS A STRONG BELIEF IN KINSHASA THAT THESE </p><p>DEFENDANTS WILL BE JUDGED BASED ON THEIR ETHNICITY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) POLOFF RECENTLY SPOKE TO MINISTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>NTUMBA LUABA, URGING HIM TO SUPPORT A FAIR TRIAL AND LIVABLE </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR THE PRISONERS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE WOMEN AND </p><p>CHILDREN.  NTUMBA TOLD POLOFF THAT THE WIVES OF KEY FIGURES </p><p>FACE FORMAL CHARGES, SO HE WAS UNABLE TO ADVOCATE RELEASE. </p><p>HE ADMITTED THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY ARE ONLY BEING </p><p>HELD BECAUSE OF THEIR HUSBANDS\' ACTIONS.  HE SAID HE HAD </p><p>PERSONALLY VISITED EACH OF THE FOUR WOMEN AND THAT THEY WERE </p><p>IN LIVABLE CONDITIONS (TWO ARE IN PAVILION 1 AND TWO ARE IN </p><p>THE WOMEN\'S SECTION OF MAKALA PRISON). </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) POST WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE </p><p>LDK ASSASSINATION TRIAL, ESPECIALLY FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS ANGLE </p><p>AND CONCERNING ANY ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE U.S.  POLOF IS </p><p>ATTENDING THE APRIL 3 TRAIL OPENING AND WILL REPORT ON </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS AS THE TRIAL PROGRESSES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p></p></div>
