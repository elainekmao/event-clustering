MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  03-31-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PHUM, ECON, SOCI, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  In positive move for peace process, Tigers </p><p>agree to discuss Muslim claims re land in the east </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Colombo 229 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  A March 27 meeting between Muslims and </p><p>the Tamil Tigers has gone some way toward dealing with a </p><p>long-standing dispute over land.  The dispute revolves </p><p>around Muslim claims that the Tigers have kicked them </p><p>off land they own in the east.  Muslim and Tamil </p><p>representatives laud the meeting and its agreement to </p><p>discuss the issue further as a positive development. </p><p>Due in large part to constructive discussions such as </p><p>that on March 27, Muslim-Tamil tensions in the east seem </p><p>to have eased a bit of late.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MARCH 27 MEETING:  A long-standing dispute </p><p>between Muslims and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) involving land in Sri Lanka\'s Eastern Province </p><p>was discussed in a constructive fashion at a March 27 </p><p>meeting in Batticaloa District.  The meeting was hosted </p><p>by the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission </p><p>(SLMM), and involved delegations led by Deputy Minister </p><p>of Housing Basheer Dawood of the Sri Lanka Muslim </p><p>Congress (SLMC) and T. Ramesh, a high-ranking LTTE </p><p>commander in the east.  With respect to substance, the </p><p>delegations agreed to form three committees to look into </p><p>land dispute issues in three specific areas of the east. </p><p>The delegations also agreed on a draft proposal </p><p>regarding the dispute that would be presented at the </p><p>seventh round of high-level peace talks, which is </p><p>scheduled to take place April 29 - May 2.  The key </p><p>phrase from the draft proposal is that whatever "rights, </p><p>privileges and obligations that are available to Tamils </p><p>will be extended to Muslims as well, as far as the </p><p>paddy-lands are concerned."  (Note:  Most of the lands </p><p>in question are agricultural -- see Para 3.)  At the </p><p>close of the meeting, the two sides issued a joint </p><p>statement that said their discussion had been "frank, </p><p>open, cordial and friendly." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) A LONG-SIMMERING DISPUTE:  The dispute basically </p><p>centers on accusations by Muslims that the Tigers have </p><p>seized huge swaths of Muslim-owned land in the east. </p><p>Muslims, specifically, assert that members of their </p><p>community have been evicted from between 40-50,000 acres </p><p>of farmland (mostly paddy fields) by Tamils backed up </p><p>the LTTE.  The Muslims note that the land in question is </p><p>quite fertile and that the loss in income for their </p><p>community has been immense.  For their part, LTTE </p><p>representatives state that Muslims have not been </p><p>evicted, but that, because of the war, the Sri Lankan </p><p>military has cut off access to their lands to them.  The </p><p>LTTE has also argued that much of the land that the </p><p>Muslims claim was, in fact, originally owned by Tamils </p><p>in any case.  While most observers admit that the </p><p>dispute is complex and involves multiple plots with </p><p>different histories, they basically give more credence </p><p>to the Muslim side of the argument. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) POSITIVE REACTION:  Muslim and Tamil </p><p>representatives laud the meeting\'s outcome as a positive </p><p>development.  National Unity Alliance (NUA) MP M.L.A.M </p><p>Hizbullah, a Muslim from Batticaloa, told us he was </p><p>enthusiastic about the meeting\'s outcome.  He said he </p><p>believed Muslims might even be tilling their lands in </p><p>the east again in the very near future.  He added one </p><p>point of caution, however, commenting that twice before </p><p>the LTTE has permitted Muslims to return to work on </p><p>their lands only to have the LTTE steal the harvest. </p><p>(Note:  This happened during previous peace processes.) </p><p>That said, he remarked that the March 27 meeting was a </p><p>solid first step, which should create momentum to </p><p>resolve the issue. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In the meantime, G. Ponnambalam, a Tamil </p><p>National Alliance MP, told us that he also thought the </p><p>meeting was a real confidence-builder.  He argued that </p><p>LTTE control of the paddy fields has been primarily </p><p>motivated by military concerns.  With the ceasefire now </p><p>in place, he said he believed that the Tigers will soon </p><p>return land to the Muslims since they (the Muslims) are </p><p>no longer considered "enemies" to the Tamil cause. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  Due in large part to constructive </p><p>discussions such as that on March 27, Muslim-Tamil </p><p>tensions in the east seem to have eased a bit of late. </p><p>The LTTE\'s agreement to pursue a resolution of the </p><p>multiple claims re land seems to have done wonders as a </p><p>confidence-building measure for the Muslims.  That said, </p><p>as noted above, the LTTE has given promises in this area </p><p>before only to turn its back on them.  In addition to </p><p>continued discussions re land, Muslims are also looking </p><p>forward to political-level consultations with the LTTE, </p><p>which are slated to take place within the next three </p><p>weeks.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
