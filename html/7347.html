<p>S E C R E T COLOMBO 000640 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, NEA, NEA/NGA, </p><p>DS/DSS/ITA; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>NEW DELHI FOR POL/REGIONAL AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 04-11-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, PTER, ASEC, CE, IZ, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  Ambassador urges GSL to expel post-Saddam </p><p>official Iraqis and protect diplomatic property </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) State 93783 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) State 92281 </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 623 (All Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) The Ambassador spoke to Sri Lankan Foreign </p><p>Secretary Nihal Rodrigo on April 11, and reviewed Ref B </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>points re expulsion of post-Saddam official Iraqis and </p><p>suspending the operations of its embassy.  Rodrigo </p><p>replied that the situation was very "confusing" and that </p><p>the GSL was "polling" the views of other South Asian </p><p>countries.  He said that as far as the government was </p><p>aware there were only two Iraqi officials left in the </p><p>country:  Charge Wajdi Mardan Abbas and one other </p><p>person.  (Note:  See Ref C regarding a recent </p><p>communication by Abbas, a known Iraqi intelligence </p><p>operative, to the U.S. Embassy.)  Two other officials </p><p>had recently left the country.  As if he was feeling </p><p>sorry for the Iraqis, Rodrigo commented that Abbas was </p><p>here "with his wife and two children" and the other </p><p>Iraqi official seemed to be a courier. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Ambassador also reviewed Ref A points re </p><p>protecting Iraqi diplomatic property with Rodrigo. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) COMMENT:  Rodrigo said the GSL would review </p><p>the issues that the Ambassador raised and get back to us </p><p>shortly.  The Ambassador was left with the strong </p><p>impression that the government did not plan to expel </p><p>Abbas, however.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
