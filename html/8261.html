<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 002235 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS TO USTR FOR DOUG BELL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: MIDDLE EAST TRADE INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 135263 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard Jones for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.(C)  Embassy Kuwait will work enthusiastically to advance </p><p>the President\'s new Middle East Trade Initiative as outlined </p><p>in reftel. We noted two particular themes in the message: a) </p><p>countries will need to do some heavy lifting to benefit from </p><p>the initiative; and b) the Administration understands the </p><p>initiative is a long-term commitment, which will take years </p><p>to fully achieve. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Kuwaiti businessmen, who have long lamented the </p><p>government\'s dominance of the local economy, often echo the </p><p>complaints of GOK technocrats charged with developing and </p><p>implementing economic reforms.  We see Kuwait as a country </p><p>fully aware of its need for reform, fully aware of the kinds </p><p>of reforms needed, and fully capable of making the needed </p><p>reforms.  The challenge here has been, and continues to be, </p><p>an unfortunate lack of political leadership; a lack of a </p><p>vision for the transformation of the Kuwaiti economy.  While </p><p>the new Middle East Trade Initiative will likely receive a </p><p>warm welcome from Kuwaiti leaders, it will take sustained </p><p>prodding to overcome the current inertia in GOK policy </p><p>making.  Characteristically, Embassy has received no/no </p><p>inquiries from GOK interlocutors about the initiative since </p><p>the President\'s May 9 announcement. </p><p> </p><p>What\'s Attractive/What\'s Problematic </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Kuwait will find the idea of closer ties to the U.S. </p><p>attractive, given concerns that their special relationship </p><p>with the U.S. will fade as Iraq grows in importance. </p><p>Further, the GOK has long been anxious to conclude a </p><p>Bilateral Investment Treaty with the U.S. (their main motive, </p><p>however, is preferential tax treatment for their financial </p><p>investments in the U.S., and they have thus far been </p><p>unwilling to relax restrictions on FDI into Kuwait).  The GOK </p><p>will also welcome the offer of technical assistance to build </p><p>trade capabilities, particularly on WTO issues. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Predictably, the suggestion of including Israel in the </p><p>FTA will be a significant hurdle for Kuwait.  However, full </p><p>settlement of Israeli-Palestinian issues would help overcome </p><p>this.  The GOK will likely have few other reservations about </p><p>the Initiative. </p><p> </p><p>How Will Kuwait Participate </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) If past experience is a guide, we believe the GOK will </p><p>support the concept of the Initiative and applaud its </p><p>introduction.  Mid- and senior-level officials and many </p><p>Kuwaiti businessmen will welcome U.S. pressure on the GOK to </p><p>finally implement deep and broad reforms, and urge us to do </p><p>even more.  However, unless the senior leadership of Kuwait </p><p>embraces the initiative and gives it vocal support, Ministers </p><p>will take only half-steps, while looking over their shoulders </p><p>at a congenitally hostile National Assembly ready to punish </p><p>any misstep. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) The GOK has preached reform since before Iraq\'s </p><p>invasion of the country, but frustratingly little has been </p><p>done since then.  This argues for even greater U.S. pressure </p><p>on Kuwait than on other states in the region to reform and to </p><p>do it quickly.  This initiative, with its long-term approach </p><p>and an expectation for countries to really do something to </p><p>take advantage of it, might actually bear some fruit provided </p><p>we spend enough time in the garden. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
