<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 GABORONE 004838 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S -- KIM-SCOTT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09/03/03 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECIN, ECON, KPRP </p><p>SUBJECT:  A SADC PRIMER: TIME FOR A REVISED EDITION? </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: SCOTT DELISI, CHARGE, AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>REASON:  1.5 (B) </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL: A) PRETORIA 6853, B) STATE 115688, C) PRETORIA 8653 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY.  SOUTHERN AFRICA IS INCREASINGLY TOUTED AS THE </p><p>CONTINENT\'S ENGINE OF GROWTH, WITH THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) DRIVING THE TRAIN.  SADC HAS </p><p>MATURED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE ITS FORMATION IN 1992, BUT FORGING </p><p>REGIONAL COOPERATION FROM NATIONALIST PROCLIVITIES IS AS </p><p>DELICATE A PROCESS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION </p><p>AND NORTH AMERICA.  THE SADC SECRETARIAT, WITH ITS AMORPHOUS </p><p>ROLE AND LIMITED RESOURCES, HAS PROVEN TO BE NO MATCH FOR </p><p>STRONG NATIONAL LEADERS WITH SOMETIMES CONFLICTING IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>PERSPECTIVES, WHO HAVE OFTEN DOMINATED THE ORGANIZATION.  AS </p><p>ITS MANDATE EXPANDS BEYOND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO </p><p>STATESMANSHIP, SADC IS STRUGGLING TO LIVE UP TO THE WORLD\'S </p><p>EPXECTATIONS.  WHETHER SADC\'S ORIGINAL STRUCTURE IS UP TO THE </p><p>TASK IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEBATE, AND PROMISES TO FEATURE </p><p>PROMINENTLY AT THE SEPTEMBER SADC SUMMIT IN MALAWI. </p><p> </p><p>2.  NONETHELESS, SADC STATES HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN JUST </p><p>GEOGRAPHY, AND THEREIN LIES SOME OF THE ORGANIZATION\'S TRUE </p><p>POTENTIAL.  THE 12 COUNTRIES SHARE A CONSENSUAL APPROACH TO </p><p>REGIONAL DECISION-MAKING, ESPOUSE (BUT DON\'T ALWAYS PRACTICE) </p><p>DEMOCRATIC IDEALS, AND PROMOTE A LARGELY FREE MARKET APPROACH </p><p>TO DOING BUSINESS.  ULTIMATELY, SOUTH AFRICA, AS THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S DOMINANT MEMBER, REMAINS THE KEY TO BALANCED </p><p>REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT.  ITS NEIGHBORS ARE KEEPING AN INTERESTED </p><p>IF WARY EYE ON THE INDICATORS OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>REGIONAL INTEGRATION.  FOR SADC TO ACHIEVE ITS DUAL GOALS OF </p><p>BALANCED REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL STABILITY </p><p>AND SECURITY, SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS SADC PARTNERS WILL HAVE TO </p><p>BACK THE REGIONAL INTEGRATION CONCEPT WITH MORE THAN WORDS. </p><p>THEY HAVE TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE AND </p><p>DIRECTION.  NOW THEY ARE FACING THE TRUE TEST OF REGIONAL </p><p>INTEGRATION: IMPLEMENTING REFORMS THAT MAY INVOLVE DIFFICULT </p><p>COMPROMISES BY SOME FOR THE GOOD OF ALL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GENESIS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE 12-MEMBER SADC EVOLVED FROM THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COORDINATING CONFERENCE (SADCC), WHICH WAS FOUNDED </p><p>IN 1980 BY THE FRONTLINE STATES (FLS) TO ADVANCE REGIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION AGAINST APARTHEID.  WITH APARTHEID\'S DEMISE, </p><p>SADCC\'S ROLE SHIFTED FROM ISOLATING APARTHEID TO PROMOTING THE </p><p>FLS\' ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  IN AUGUST, 1992, "SADCC" EMERGED </p><p>AS "SADC," WITH AN UPDATED MANDATE OF FOSTERING ECONOMIC </p><p>PROSPERITY, DEVELOPMENT, AND STABILITY THROUGH REGIONAL TRADE </p><p>LIBERALIZATION AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WHEREAS SADCC HAD WORKED TO COORDINATE MEMBER STATES\' </p><p>ECONOMIES ON SPECIFIC PROJECTS WITH REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS, THE </p><p>NEW SADC HAS FOCUSED ON INTEGRATING STATES\' ACTIVITIES INTO </p><p>REGIONAL ACTION.  SOUTH AFRICA, THE FORMER PARIAH, NOW PLAYS A </p><p>PIVOTAL ROLE IN SADC\'S REGIONAL INTEGRATION STRATEGY, AS DOES </p><p>THE STABILITY OF THOSE COUNTRIES (MOZAMBIQUE, ANGOLA, NAMIBIA) </p><p>EMERGING FROM CIVIL WAR.  THE 1992 SADC TREATY COMMITS MEMBER </p><p>COUNTRIES TO HARMONIZE AND RATIONALIZE THEIR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>POLICIES AND STRATEGIES; AN AMBITIOUS GOAL FOR 12 COUNTRIES </p><p>WITH WIDELY DIFFERING CAPACITIES FOR GROWTH.  THE TREATY IS </p><p>ENFORCEABLE THROUGH SANCTIONS, WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED AGAINST A </p><p>MEMBER STATE THAT 1) PERSISTENTLY FAILS TO FULFILL ITS </p><p>OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SADC TREATY, 2) IMPLEMENTS POLICIES </p><p>WHICH UNDERMINE THE PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES OF SADC, OR 3) </p><p>IS MORE THAN ONE YEAR OVERDUE IN PAYING ITS DUES WITHOUT </p><p>HAVING OBTAINED A DISPENSATION FROM SADC. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMIT OF HEADS OF STATE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE TEN ORIGINAL MEMBERS (ANGOLA, BOTSWANA, LESOTHO, </p><p>MALAWI, MOZAMBIQUE, NAMIBIA, SWAZILAND, TANZANIA, ZAMBIA, </p><p>ZIMBABWE) WELCOMED SOUTH AFRICA INTO SADC IN AUGUST, 1994, </p><p>FOLLOWED BY MAURITIUS IN 1995.  SOUTH AFRICA\'S PRESIDENT </p><p>MANDELA HAS BEEN CHAIRMAN OF THE SADC SUMMIT OF HEADS OF STATE </p><p>AND GOVERNMENT (SUMMIT) SINCE 1996, REPLACING BOTSWANA\'S </p><p>PRESIDENT MASIRE WHO HELD THE OFFICE SINCE SADC\'S INCEPTION. </p><p>AS THE ULTIMATE POLICY-MAKING INSTITUTION OF SADC, THE SUMMIT </p><p>SETS THE COMMUNITY\'S OVERALL POLICY DIRECTION, CREATES </p><p>COMMISSIONS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, AND APPOINTS THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>AND DEPUTY EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE SADC SECRETARIAT, </p><p>LOCATED IN GABORONE.  THE NEXT SUMMIT MEETING, SCHEDULED TO </p><p>BEGIN ON SEPTEMBER 8 IN MALAWI, IS EXPECTED TO TACKLE </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES RANGING FROM EXPANDING SADC\'S MEMBERSHIP, </p><p>TO RESTRUCTURING THE ORGANIZATION, TO FINALIZING SADC\'S </p><p>POSITION ON TRADE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). </p><p>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE SUMMIT IS ADVISED BY A COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, WHICH </p><p>ALSO APPROVES SADC POLICIES, STRATEGIES AND WORK PROGRAMS. </p><p>COMPRISED OF MINISTERS FROM EACH STATE (GENERALLY PLANNING OR </p><p>FINANCE MINISTERS), THE COUNCIL OVERSEES THE FUNCTIONING AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF SADC AND ENSURES POLICY IMPLEMENTATION.  IT </p><p>ALSO ASSIGNS SPECIFIC AREAS OF COOPERATION TO SECTOR </p><p>COORDINATING UNITS ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE MINISTRY </p><p>IN EACH MEMBER STATE.  A STANDING COMMITTEE OF OFFICIALS, </p><p>COMPRISED OF A PERMANENT SECRETARY FROM EACH MEMBER STATE, </p><p>ACTS AS TECHNICAL ADVISOR TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ALSO SERVE AS NATIONAL </p><p>CONTACT POINTS RESPONSIBLE FOR SADC MATTERS, LINKING OTHER </p><p>AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT WITH SADC. </p><p> </p><p>SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  SADC\'S EIGHTEEN SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS CURRENTLY ARE </p><p>DIVIDED AMONGST THE TWELVE MEMBERS, WITH A SECTORAL COMMITTEE </p><p>OF MINISTERS SUPERVISING EACH COORDINATING UNIT.  RANGING FROM </p><p>ENERGY (ANGOLA) TO TOURISM (MAURITIUS) TO LABOR (ZAMBIA), THE </p><p>COORDINATING UNITS SPEARHEAD THE REGIONAL POLICIES AND </p><p>PROGRAMS FOR EACH PARTICULAR SECTOR.  INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES </p><p>PROVIDE FUNDING AND STAFF TO ADMINISTER THEIR RESPECTIVE </p><p>SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS, WHICH FUNCTION AS PART OF THAT </p><p>STATE\'S NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE CAPACITY OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO STEER SADC\'S </p><p>PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR SECTORS VARIES CONSIDERABLY.  LOGJAMS </p><p>HAVE IMPEDED PROGRESS WHEN EXPERTISE, EFFICIENCY, OR DOMESTIC </p><p>DISTRACTIONS PREVENT THE MINISTRY FROM PROMOTING ITS SECTOR </p><p>EFFECTIVELY AND DYNAMICALLY.  ANGOLA\'S PREOCCUPATION WITH </p><p>RESOLVING ITS CIVIL WAR HAS WEAKENED ITS ABILITY TO LEAD SADC </p><p>ON ENERGY ISSUES, THE SECTOR IT HEADS AND ARGUABLY ONE OF THE </p><p>SECTORS MOST CRITICAL TO THE REGION\'S MODERNIZATION. </p><p>SWAZILAND\'S LACK OF EXPERTISE (AND FAILURE TO SEEK IT OUT) IN </p><p>HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN BLAMED FOR THE SLOW </p><p>PROGRESS IN THAT VITAL SECTOR.  ADDED TO SUCH WEAKNESSES IS A </p><p>LACK OF INTER-SECTORAL COORDINATION THAT FURTHER DISRUPTS </p><p>REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.  OFTEN BLAMED FOR SADC\'S UNEVEN </p><p>PERFORMANCE, THE COORDINATING UNITS REVEAL THE HANDICAP THAT </p><p>THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL DISPARITIES AMONG THE SADC </p><p>COUNTRIES CAUSES. </p><p> </p><p>CONSOLIDATION PROPOSAL: EFFICIENT BUT UNPOPULAR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO REVITALIZE SADC AND IMPROVE ITS </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS, MEMBERS COMMISSIONED A REVIEW OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S STRUCTURE IN 1995.  THE REPORT RECOMMENDED </p><p>CONSOLIDATING THE COORDINATING UNITS INTO FIVE DIRECTORATES </p><p>THAT WOULD FOCUS MORE ON POLICY THAN PROJECT COORDINATION. </p><p>EXISTING SECTORS WOULD BE CLUSTERED TOGETHER IN KEY AREAS OF </p><p>COOPERATION FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY: 1) AGRICULTURE, NATURAL </p><p>RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT; 2) HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; 3) INFRASTRUCTURE, COMMUNICATIONS AND </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; 4) TRADE, INDUSTRY, INVESTMENT AND </p><p>FINANCE; AND 5) COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, CULTURE AND </p><p>INFORMATION.  A POSSIBLE SIXTH DIRECTORATE FOR WATER RESOURCE </p><p>MANAGEMENT MIGHT BE REQUIRED, ACCORDING TO THE REPORT.  THE </p><p>DIRECTORATES WOULD BE FUNDED BY REGIONAL RESOURCES (IN PART TO </p><p>REDUCE DEPENDENCY ON DONORS) AND STAFFED BY REGIONAL </p><p>PROFESSIONALS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WHILE THIS MAY BE A MORE EFFICIENT APPROACH, IT HAS </p><p>ENCOUNTERED FIERCE RESISTANCE FROM A NUMBER OF SADC STATES, </p><p>SOME OF WHICH WOULD LOSE THEIR SECTOR OF RESPONSIBILITY.  AS </p><p>THE REPORT POINTS OUT, SADC\'S PRESENT STRUCTURE HAS ENSURED A </p><p>SENSE OF "OWNERSHIP" BY MEMBER STATES AND AVOIDED EXCESSIVE </p><p>TENSIONS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION BY EQUALIZING THE FLOW OF </p><p>BENEFITS.  DECIDING WHERE THE DIRECTORATES WOULD BE BASED </p><p>WOULD LIKELY INVOLVE A STICKY, AND HIGHLY CHARGED, DEBATE </p><p>AMIDST FEARS OF CERTAIN STATES DOMINATING THE ORGANIZATION. </p><p>AS USAID DISCOVERED IN 1996 WHEN SADC MEMBERS CRITICIZED THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT FOR SIGNING AGREEMENTS ON SADC\'S BEHALF, </p><p>ENTHUSIASM FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION HAS NOT OVERCOME CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT CEDING NATIONAL CONTROL, IF NOT SOVEREIGNTY, TO A </p><p>CENTRAL, SUPRA-NATIONAL SECRETARIAT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COST CONCERNS MAY ALSO WORK AGAINST CONSOLIDATION. </p><p>CURRENTLY, EACH STATE CONTROLS EXPENDITURES FOR THE </p><p>OPERATIONAL EXPENSES OF ITS SECTOR.  UNDER THE NEW PROPOSAL, </p><p>MEMBERS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A CENTRAL FUND THAT WOULD FINANCE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF THE DIRECTORATES.  SOME STATES FEAR THIS </p><p>MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENT, WHICH </p><p>LETS THEM DECIDE HOW MUCH (OR HOW LITTLE) TO SPEND ON THEIR </p><p>SADC SECTOR OF RESPONSIBILITY.  THE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS MIGHT BE DETERMINED BASED ON POPULATION, GDP, OR </p><p>GDP PER CAPITA; OPTIONS THAT AGAIN RAISE CONCERNS OF DOMINANCE </p><p>BY SOME MEMBERS.  THE RECOMMENDATION THAT SADC SHOULD SOLICIT </p><p>GREATER PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT IN ITS PROGRAM OF ACTION HAS </p><p>ALSO GENERATED CONTROVERSY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE REPORT\'S PROPOSALS WERE DISCUSSED BY DELEGATIONS FROM </p><p>THE 12 SADC STATES AT A RECENT REGIONAL WORKSHOP IN GABORONE </p><p>ON THE RATIONALIZATION OF THE SADC PROGRAM OF ACTION.  AFTER A </p><p>CONTENTIOUS OPENING SESSION, THE WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS CHANGED </p><p>THE FORMAT TO CLOSED SESSION DISCUSSIONS.  THE WORKSHOP\'S </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED AT THE UPCOMING COUNCIL OF </p><p>MINISTERS\' MEETING IN BLANTYRE AT WHICH THE RESTRUCTURING </p><p>ISSUE IS EXPECTED TO TOP THE AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SADC SECRETARIAT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE REPORT ALSO TARGETED THE SADC SECRETARIAT FOR </p><p>STREAMLINING, SUGGESTING THAT ITS FUNCTIONS BE LIMITED TO </p><p>POLICY HARMONIZATION, LOBBYING, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND </p><p>INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, AND ADMINISTRATION.  CURRENTLY, THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT\'S PROFESSIONAL STAFF IS RESPONSIBLE FOR STRATEGIC </p><p>PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF SADC PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS GENERAL </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING FINANCES AND </p><p>DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION.  OPERATIONAL COSTS OF RUNNING THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT ARE FUNDED FROM CONTRIBUTIONS BY MEMBER STATES IN </p><p>EQUAL AMOUNTS SET BY THE COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>14.  HEADQUARTERED IN GABORONE, THE SECRETARIAT HAS BEEN </p><p>CRITICIZED AS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE.  SOME MEMBERS </p><p>ADVOCATE ABOLISHING THE SECRETARIAT ALTOGETHER, ALTHOUGH NO </p><p>REALISTIC ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN PRESENTED.  EARLIER THIS </p><p>YEAR, THE SECRETARIAT CAME UNDER ATTACK FOR MISMANAGEMENT, </p><p>WITH SOME MEMBERS REPORTEDLY CALLING FOR THE REMOVAL OF </p><p>EXECUTIVE SECRETARY DR. KAIRE MBUENDE OF NAMIBIA.  DR. MBUENDE </p><p>ESCAPED RELATIVELY UNSCATHED, THOUGH HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE HAS </p><p>NOT MADE HIM POPULAR.  SADC HEADS OF STATE WILL DECIDE AT THE </p><p>MALAWI MEETING WHETHER TO REAPPOINT DR. MBUENDE FOR ANOTHER </p><p>FOUR YEARS WHEN HIS PRESENT TERM EXPIRES IN DECEMBER.  AS THE </p><p>RESTRUCTURING REPORT POINTS OUT, MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS LODGED </p><p>AGAINST THE SECRETARIAT COULD BE ADDRESSED BY CLARIFYING THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT\'S MANDATE AND ALLOCATING SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR </p><p>IT TO IMPLEMENT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PROTOCOLS: JUST ONE OF MANY STEPS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  WHILE IT GRAPPLES WITH RATIONALIZING ITS PROGRAM OF </p><p>ACTION AND STRUCTURE, THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>FOR SADC TO BUILD A REPUTATION AS AN INFLUENTIAL REGIONAL </p><p>BLOCK.  THE WEAK LINK AT THIS STAGE SEEMS TO BE TOO MANY </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES TOO SOON, WITH SADC OUTGROWING ITS RESOURCES AND </p><p>CAPABILITIES, ACCORDING TO THE RESTRUCTURING REPORT.  SADC HAS </p><p>FORGED AN ARRAY OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TIES IN THE </p><p>FORM OF PROTOCOLS THAT AFFIRM GENERAL PRINCIPLES; NOW IT IS </p><p>FACED WITH THE COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING TASK OF PUTTING </p><p>FLESH ON THE BONES OF THOSE PROTOCOLS BEFORE EVENTS OVERTAKE </p><p>THE PROCESS.  USAID\'S REGIONAL CENTER FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA </p><p>(RCSA) IS FUNDING WORKSHOPS AND PROGRAMS TO SPEED UP </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF SADC POLICY AGREEMENTS AND PROTOCOLS AND TO </p><p>ENSURE THE FINAL PRODUCTS REFLECT THE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF </p><p>ALL STAKEHOLDERS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE MOMENTUM FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THIS </p><p>BURGEONING REGION PUSHES SADC STATES INTO ACTION, SOMETIMES </p><p>UNILATERALLY, WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF LONG-TERM, COORDINATED </p><p>REGIONAL PLANNING.  NAMIBIA\'S RECENT PLAN TO DIVERT WATER FROM </p><p>THE OKAVANGO RIVER, WHICH ORIGINATES IN THE ANGOLAN HIGHLANDS </p><p>AND EMPTIES INTO BOTSWANA\'S FAMED OKAVANGO DELTA, HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>THE NEED FOR A REGIONAL APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT OF SHARED </p><p>WATERCOURSES.  MEMBER STATES SIGNED THE SADC PROTOCOL ON </p><p>SHARED WATERCOURSES IN 1995 BUT IT WILL BE MONTHS BEFORE THAT </p><p>IS TRANSLATED INTO POLICIES AND ACTION.  DROUGHT-PRONE NAMIBIA </p><p>MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WAIT FOR REGIONAL COORDINATION, THOUGH IT </p><p>HAS ENGAGED IN REGULAR CONSULTATIONS WITH THE BOTSWANA </p><p>GOVERNMENT REGARDING THE PIPELINE PROJECT\'S IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE PLIGHT OF THE SADC TRADE PROTOCOL, ONE OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S PRIMARY RAISON D\'ETRE, DEMONSTRATES THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH, TOO FAST.  HEATED </p><p>DEBATE OVER SUCH CONTENTIOUS POINTS AS FREE MOVEMENT OF </p><p>CAPITAL AND LABOR, TARIFF REDUCTIONS, STANDARDIZATION OF </p><p>REGULATIONS AND LEGAL PROCEDURES HAS MADE PROGRESS ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRADE PROTOCOL (RATIFIED BY ONLY TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES TO DATE) PAINFULLY SLOW.  A REGION-WIDE SHORTAGE OF </p><p>EXPERTS TO NEGOTIATE COMPLICATED TARIFF REDUCTIONS ADDS TO </p><p>EXISTING CAPACITY DISPARITIES WITHIN SADC, MAKING IT EVEN MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO FINALIZE PROTOCOL DETAILS.  (REFTEL A). </p><p> </p><p>18.  IN THE MEANTIME, SOME SADC STATES ARE NEGOTIATING AND </p><p>SIGNING BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENTS WHILE OTHERS DEFER </p><p>NMGOTIATIONS TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE REGIONAL </p><p>AGREEMENT.  SOUTH AFRICA HAS HELD UP ITS TRADE DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION, CLAIMING THAT IT CANNOT SUBMIT ITS </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR A FREE TRADE PACT WITH THE EU UNTIL THE SADC </p><p>TRADE PROTOCOL TERMS HAVE BEEN FINALIZED, ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS.  AT A RECENT MEETING IN TANZANIA, SADC TRADE </p><p>MINISTERS WERE ABLE TO AGREE ON A GENERAL TIMETABLE FOR </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS ON A PROPOSAL TO FREE REGIONAL TRADE EXCHANGES </p><p>WITHIN EIGHT YEARS; A START, BUT A LONG WAY FROM PROCLAIMING A </p><p>SADC FREE TRADE AREA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL ORGAN </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  RECOGNIZING THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPENDS ON </p><p>POLITICAL STABILITY, SADC HAS BROADENED ITS MISSION TO INCLUDE </p><p>POLITICS AND SECURITY.  IN 1995, MEMBERS ESTABLISHED THE ORGAN </p><p>FOR POLITICS, SECURITY AND DEFENSE (POLITICAL ORGAN) TO </p><p>PROMOTE COOPERATION ON POLITICAL AND SECURITY ISSUES OF A </p><p>REGIONAL NATURE.  CURRENTLY CHAIRED BY ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE, THE POLITICAL ORGAN IS AIMED AT CONFLICT PREVENTION </p><p>AND MANAGEMENT.  THE GREAT LAKES CRISES AND THE AFRICAN CRISIS </p><p>RESPONSE INITIATIVE (ACRI) PRESENTED TWO RECENT OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>FOR SADC TO RESPOND REGIONALLY TO EVENTS OF GLOBAL IMPORTANCE. </p><p>MUGABE\'S FAILURE TO CONVENE THE ORGAN TO ADDRESS EITHER ISSUE </p><p>CREATED A VOID WHERE SADC MIGHT HAVE HAD AN INFLUENTIAL VOICE. </p><p>HIS TIGHT REIN NOT ONLY PREVENTED SADC FROM TAKING A FORMAL </p><p>POSITION, IT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES TO </p><p>ACT OFFICIALLY, OUT OF DEFERENCE TO THE REGIONAL BODY. </p><p> </p><p>20.  ZIMBABWE\'S LACK OF DECISIVE RESPONSE TO UNFOLDING </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS MAY BE PART OF AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN </p><p>MUGABE AND MANDELA TO ALTER THE PROFILE OF THE POLITICAL ORGAN </p><p>WITHIN THE SADC ORGANIZATION, BOTSWANA DEFENSE FORCE (BDF) </p><p>COMMANDER LT. GEN. IAN KHAMA SAID AT A JUNE MEETING WITH </p><p>ACTING A/S TWADDELL IN WASHINGTON (REFTEL A).  KHAMA </p><p>SPECULATED THAT MANDELA MIGHT BE SEEKING TO RE-POSITION THE </p><p>ORGAN AS A SECTOR RATHER THAN A SEPARATE SADC ENTITY IN ORDER </p><p>TO CURB MUGABE\'S TENDENCY TO USE HIS POSITION AS ORGAN </p><p>CHAIRPERSON TO SPEAK UNILATERALLY ON SADC\'S BEHALF.  (NOTE. </p><p>REFTEL B REFLECTS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON PROPOSALS TO </p><p>CONSOLIDATE THE SADC AND ORGAN CHAIRMANSHIPS.  END NOTE.)  IF </p><p>KHAMA IS RIGHT, MANDELA (AND PERHAPS OTHERS) MAY HAVE HONED IN </p><p>ON TWO IMPEDIMENTS THAT HAVE WEAKENED SADC\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>CONSOLIDATE ITS POWER AS A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION: </p><p>PERSONALITIES AND COHESION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOW BIG IS "SOUTHERN" AFRICA </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  HOW SADC CAN AND SHOULD FUNCTION TO PROMOTE REGIONALISM </p><p>IS STILL BEING DEBATED.  THE INFLUENCE OF STRONG REGIONAL </p><p>LEADERS (AND DONORS) ON THE DIRECTION AND PROGRESS IN SECTORS </p><p>SOMETIMES OUTWEIGHS THE ORGANIZATION\'S INPUT.  EVEN SADC\'S </p><p>COMPOSITION ISN\'T FULLY SETTLED, WITH TALK OF MEMBERSHIP FOR </p><p>THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DROC), KENYA, UGANDA, THE </p><p>SEYCHELLES, AND MADAGASCAR SURFACING PERIODICALLY.  SADC </p><p>EXECUTIVE SECRETARY MBUENDE RENEWED THE INVITATION TO KENYA </p><p>AND UGANDA DURING JUNE MEETINGS WITH THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY </p><p>OF THE REVITALIZED COMMISSION FOR EAST AFRICAN COOPERATION </p><p>(EAC).  (NOTE: TANZANIA IS THE THIRD MEMBER OF THE EAC, AND </p><p>ALSO A MEMBER OF SADC.  END NOTE.)  PRESIDENT MUGABE AND </p><p>NAMIBIA\'S PRESIDENT NUJOMA HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR </p><p>DROC\'S ADMISSION TO SADC, AND MEMBERSHIP APPLICATIONS BY THE </p><p>DROC AND THE SEYCHELLES ARE UP FOR CONSIDERATION AT THE </p><p>BLANTYRE SADC SUMMIT, ACCORDING TO DR. MBUENDE. </p><p> </p><p>22.  NEITHER KENYA NOR UGANDA IS EXPECTED TO ACCEPT SADC\'S </p><p>INVITATION, THOUGH NEITHER HAS OFFICIALLY REFUSED THE OFFER, </p><p>SADC\'S SENIOR ECONOMIST DR. CHUNGU MWILA TOLD POLOFF.  DR. </p><p>MWILA PREDICTED THAT THE RESOURCE-RICH DROC WOULD JOIN SADC </p><p>BEFORE ANY OTHER CONTENDERS, BUT ADDED THAT THE SITUATION IN </p><p>DROC WOULD HAVE TO STABILIZE FIRST.  (COMMENT: GIVEN SADC\'S </p><p>PRIDE IN THE STABILITY AND DEMOCRATIC COMMITMENT OF ITS </p><p>MEMBERS, AND THE RECOGNITION THAT COORDINATING 12 COUNTRIES IS </p><p>A CHALLENGE, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY DROC MEMBERSHIP WILL BE </p><p>APPROVED AT THIS TIME. END COMMENT.)  IT WOULD TAKE A </p><p>UNANIMOUS DECISION OF THE SADC SUMMIT FOR A NEW COUNTRY TO BE </p><p>ADMITTED TO SADC, AND SOME STATES, SUCH AS BOTSWANA, WOULD </p><p>PREFER TO SEE THE ORGANIZATION RUNNING MORE EFFECTIVELY BEFORE </p><p>NEW MEMBERS ARE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>23.  A MORE LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT SADC WILL STRENGTHEN ITS </p><p>COOPERATION WITH OTHER REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN AFRICA, LATIN </p><p>AMERICA, AND SOUTH EAST ASIA.  DR. MBUENDE HAS STATED THAT </p><p>STRONGER "SOUTH-SOUTH" TIES WILL BOLSTER THE POSITION OF </p><p>AFRICA WITHIN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO), GIVING </p><p>AFRICAN COUNTRIES MORE OF A VOICE IN SETTING THE POLICIES AND </p><p>REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THEM.  ENSURING COMPLEMENTARY AGENDAS </p><p>IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHERE MEMBERSHIP OVERLAPS, AS IN THE </p><p>CASE OF TANZANIA WHICH IS A MEMBER OF SADC AND THE EAC, DR. </p><p>MBUENDE SAID FOLLOWING THE JUNE EAC MEETINGS.  HE ALSO </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE CRITICAL ROLE REGIONAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES </p><p>WILL PLAY IN BRINGING THE AFRICAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (AEC) TO </p><p>LIFE.  IMPROVED RELATIONS BETWEEN SADC AND THE COMMON MARKET </p><p>FOR EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA (COMESA), INCLUDING RECENT </p><p>MEETINGS BETWEEN SADC\'S EXECUTIVE SECRETARY MBUENDE AND </p><p>COMESA\'S SECRETARY-GENERAL ERASTUS MWENCHA, HAVE EASED THE </p><p>RIVALRY THAT HAS HAMPERED COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>OVERLAPPING TRADE BLOCKS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONSULTATION LOWERS THE LEARNING CURVE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  SADC MAINTAINS REGULAR DIALOGUE WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COOPERATING PARTNERS (GOVERNMENTS, NGOS) THROUGH CONSULTATIVE </p><p>CONFERENCES AT WHICH PROGRAMS AND RESULTS ARE EVALUATED AND </p><p>FUTURE PLANS ARE DISCUSSED.  BY INVOLVING A BROAD RANGE OF </p><p>INTERESTED PARTIES IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING PROTOCOLS AND </p><p>POLICIES, SADC HAS TRIED TO BREAK DOWN THE PREJUDICES OF </p><p>GOVERNMENTS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND BUILD TRUST IN THE </p><p>REGIONAL INTEGRATION CONCEPT.  THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL </p><p>DISPARITIES AMONG SADC STATES FREQUENTLY TEST THE PRINCIPLES </p><p>OF BALANCE, EQUITY AND MUTUAL BENEFIT WHICH UNDERLIE SADC\'S </p><p>MAJOR POLICY GUIDELINES. </p><p> </p><p>25.  ONE WAY TO BRIDGE THE GAP IS BY FINDING COMMON GROUND IN </p><p>THE NATIONAL POLICIES AND PLANS OF MEMBER STATES.  IDENTIFYING </p><p>WHERE COUNTRIES CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER AND WORKING TO </p><p>HARMONIZE DEVELOPING POLICIES, SADC HAS SOUGHT TO PROMOTE A </p><p>REGIONAL AGENDA.  TELECOMMUNICATIONS, IN PARTICULAR, IS A </p><p>SECTOR WHERE SADC STATES, AT VARYING STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>HAVE BENEFITED FROM LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER\'S SUCCESSES AND </p><p>FAILURES.  IN THE NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FIELD, </p><p>BOTSWANA\'S PROGRESSIVE TECHNIQUES HAVE SET AN EXAMPLE THAT </p><p>OTHER SADC STATES CAN ADOPT AND ADAPT.  BY SEEKING REGIONAL </p><p>SOLUTIONS TO WHAT INITIALLY APPEAR TO BE NATIONAL PROBLEMS, </p><p>SADC STATES ARE IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF </p><p>SADC PROGRAMS, AND REDUCING THE CHANCES FOR CROSS-BORDER </p><p>CONFLICTS.  TENSIONS BETWEEN BOTSWANA AND NAMIBIA OVER A </p><p>VETERINARY FENCE CONSTRUCTED BY BOTSWANA ALONG ITS NORTHERN </p><p>BORDER EASED AFTER SADC\'S EXECUTIVE SECRETARY (ALONG WITH </p><p>OTHERS) URGED BOTH SIDES TO FIND A SOLUTION.  ONE POSSIBILITY </p><p>UNDER DISCUSSION IS A TRANS-BORDER PARK TO PRESERVE WILDLIFE </p><p>MIGRATION ROUTES AND PROTECT COMMUNITY-BASED NATURAL RESOURCE </p><p>MANAGEMENT PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>26.  THE SADC TREATY REQUIRES THAT STRONG MEMBERS ASSIST </p><p>WEAKER STATES, AN OBLIGATION THAT IN PRACTICE SOMETIMES </p><p>TRANSLATES INTO STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE THE INTERESTS OF </p><p>DOMINANT MEMBERS.  SACRIFICING SOVEREIGNTY FOR REGIONAL </p><p>DECISION-MAKING REQUIRES A FLEXIBILITY THAT NOT ALL SADC </p><p>COUNTRIES POSSESS...OR CAN AFFORD.  THE NAMIBIAN TRADE AND </p><p>INDUSTRY MINISTER\'S RECENTLY REPORTED COMMENTS THAT SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA, RESPONDING TO DOMESTIC PRESSURES, HAS DELIBERATELY </p><p>HAMPERED ITS NEIGHBORS\' INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO </p><p>PROTECT SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESSES SUGGEST THAT FORGING REGIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION WILL BE AS CHALLENGING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AS IN </p><p>EUROPE OR NORTH AMERICA.   WITH SADC MEMBER STATES PROGRESSING </p><p>AT DIFFERENT PACES AND STRUGGLING WITH DIFFERENT </p><p>DISADVANTAGES, IT WILL TAKE A FIRM COMMITMENT BY ALL 12 </p><p>MEMBERS, PARTICULARLY SOUTH AFRICA, TO PROVE THAT, ACTING </p><p>TOGETHER, SADC COUNTRIES WILL BE BETTER OFF THAN IF THEY ACT </p><p>ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>DELISI </p><p></p></div>
