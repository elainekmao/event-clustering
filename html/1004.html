<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 000381 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/DAS SKIP BOYCE, INR/B, AND EAP/PIMBS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958; DECL: 7/08/03 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, APEC, BX </p><p>SUBJECT: BRUNEI RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR BIOGRAPHIC </p><p>INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 117173;  B) BANDAR O030O </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES GEORGIA T. </p><p>WRIGHT. REASONS 1.5 (C). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION RESPONDS TO A </p><p>DEPARTMENT REQUEST FOR BRIEFING MATERIAL IN </p><p>PREPARATION FOR UPCOMING APEC MEETINGS (REFTEL A). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) OBJECTIVES OF BRUNEI\'S LEADERS AND KEY </p><p>FOCUS.  AS REPORTED IN REFTEL B, BRUNEI WILL FOCUS </p><p>ON SMALL AND MEDIUM ECONOMIES AND HUMAN RESOURCE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT (HRD).  SPECIAL INTEREST WILL BE GIVEN </p><p>TO INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY SINCE </p><p>BRUNEI IS DEVELOPING ITS CAPABLITY IN THE HOPE OF </p><p>BECOMING A FINANCIAL SERVICE HUB. WITHIN THE </p><p>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE STEERING COMMITTEE, BRUNEI </p><p>WILL WISH TO BALANCE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION </p><p>TECHNOLOGY WITH CAPACITY BUILDING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) BRUNEI APEC PLANNERS BELIEVE HRD TO BE </p><p>"CRUCIAL" TO SMALL AND MEDIUM ECONOMIES. AT THE </p><p>JULY 7 BUDGET MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE MEETING IN </p><p>SINGAPORE, BRUNEI PUSHED FORWARD THREE PROJECT- </p><p>RELATED PROPOSALS: AN HRD TRAINER EDUCATION </p><p>PROJECT TO BE CONDUCTED BY ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES </p><p>"LIKE THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA"; AN APEC-FUNDED </p><p>WORKSHOP ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE; AND A PROJECT ON </p><p>STANDARDS. THE DIRECTOR OF THE BRUNEI APEC </p><p>SECRETARIAT HAS TOLD US THAT APEC 20OO WILL </p><p>REVOLVE AROUND NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION </p><p>TECHNOLOGIES. HE SAID OTHER POTENTIAL TOPICS FOR </p><p>NEXT YEAR ARE NATURAL GAS INITIATIVES, DEVELOPING </p><p>AIR SERVICE NETWORKS, AND TOURISM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) APEC OECISION-MAKING.  THE SULTAN IS NOT </p><p>PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE APEC DECISION-MAKING </p><p>PROCESS, BUT HE IS BRIEFED AND ADVISED OF ECONOMIC </p><p>IMPLICATIONS.  THE MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND </p><p>PRIMARY RESOURCES, PEHIN HAJI ABDUL RAHMAN, IS THE </p><p>LEAD MINISTER FOR APEC ECONOMIC MATTERS.  HE IS </p><p>ASSISTED BY HIS PERMANENT SECRETARY, DATO HAJI </p><p>DANIAL, AND BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND TRADE DEVELOPMENT, LIM </p><p>JOCK HOI.  JOCK HOI IS THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF </p><p>PEHIN LIM JOCK SENG, PERMANENT SECRETARY AT THE </p><p>MFA, WHO IS ALSO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN APEC DECISION- </p><p>MAKING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) STATUS OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SULTAN AND </p><p>PRINCE JEFRI.  PRINCE JEFRI IS STILL OUT OF THE </p><p>FOLD.  HE IS PRESENTLY IN EUROPE LIVING WITH A </p><p>CONSIDERABLY SCALED DOWN ENTOURAGE. </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS INTO BRUNEI\'S MISSING BILLIONS </p><p>CONTINUE, AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT JEFFRI WILL BE </p><p>RESTORED TO THE SULTAN\'S FAVOR WHILE THE COUNTRY </p><p>IS EXPERIENCING AN UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC </p><p>DOWNTURN.  WE UNDERSTAND, HOWEVER, THAT THE TWO </p><p>ARE IN OCCASIONAL PHONE CONTACT AND THAT THEY </p><p>PLAYED POLO TOGETHER IN THE UK LAST MONTH DURING </p><p>ROYAL WEDDING FESTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) PRINCE JEFRI AND PEHIN AZIZ.  AS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, PEHIN HAJI ABDUL AZIZ IS A </p><p>CONSERVATIVE, LIGHLY INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF THE </p><p>SULTAN\'S CABINET.  HE IS PRESENTLY THE MINISTER OF </p><p>EDUCATION AND ACTING MINISTER OF HEALTH.  AFTER </p><p>THE AMEDEO COLLAPSE HE WAS APPOINTED BY THE SULTAN </p><p>TO HEAD THE BRUNEI INVESTMENT AGENCY (BIA), </p><p>FORMERLY CONTROLLED BY PRINCE JEFRI.  THE MANUKIAN </p><p>BROTHERS AND MISS AMERICA COURT CASES, WHICH </p><p>REVEALED LURID DETAILS ABOUT PRINCE JEFRI\'S </p><p>PRIVATE LIFE, PROMPTED PEHIN AZIZ TO CONVINCE THE </p><p>SULTAN OF THE DAMAGE JEFRI\'S NOTORIETY WAS DOING </p><p>TO BRUNEI\'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE AND TO THE </p><p>SULTAN\'S OWN CREDIBILITY AS A PIOUS RULER.  AZIZ </p><p>IS ALSO BELIEVED TO HAVE ALERTED THE SULTAN TO THE </p><p>IMMENSITY OF PRINCE JEFRI\'S MISAPPROPRIATIONS FROM </p><p>THE BRUNEI TREASURY.  WITHOUT QUESTION, THERE IS </p><p>ANIMOSITY BETWEEN PRINCE JEFRI AND PEHIN AZIZ, BUT </p><p>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AZIZ AND PRINCE MOHAMED </p><p>IS RELATED TO AZIZ\' INFLUENCE ON THE ROYAL FAMILY. </p><p>THE TWO MEN ARE COMPATIBLE BUT NOT COHORTS. </p><p>(ALTHOUGH RELIGIOUS, PRINCE MOHAMED IS NOT AS </p><p>CONSERVATIVE AS AZIZ, NOR IS HIS POLITICAL OUTLOOK </p><p>AS RESTRICTIVE.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) STRENGTH OF RADICAL ISLAMISTS.   IN BRUNEI, </p><p>THE OFFICIAL FAITH IS THE SHAFEITE SCHOOL OF </p><p>ISLAM.  NO FORM OF RADICAL ISLAM IS PERMITTED. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE MORE CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE CABINET, PARTICULARLY PEHIN AZIZ AND THE </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY OF THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE, HAJI HAZAIR, APPEAR TO BE ESPECIALLY </p><p>INFLUENTIAL.  HAJI HAZAIR IS A PROT\'EG\'E OF PEHIN </p><p>ISA, THE SULTAN\'S CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER CUM </p><p>MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS.  WHILE THE CONSERVATIVES </p><p>ARE CURENTLY ENJOYING A REVIVAL, THE PROGRESSIVES </p><p>ARE WAITING FOR THE DUST TO SETTLE AFTER THE </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS INTO AMEDEO ARE COMPLETE.  THEY </p><p>BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE TRUE EXTENT OF BRUNEI\'S </p><p>LOSSES IS KNOWN, EVERYONE WILL NEED TO BE INVOLVED </p><p>TO REALISTICALLY HANDLE THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) THE BRUNEI CONSTITUTION.  DURING THE VISIT </p><p>OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II IN MARCH 1998, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER PRINCE MOHAMED PUBLICALLY STATED THAT A </p><p>REVISED CONSTITUTION SOON WOULD BE UNVEILED. IT </p><p>WAS NOT.  THE MEDIA ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY 1999 THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF A SUBCOMMITTEE TO REMOVE SOME OF </p><p>THE ANTIQUATED BRITISH LAWS FROM THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>AND REALIGN SOME (UNSPECIFIED) LAWS WITH ISLAMIC </p><p>LAW.  NOTHING ELSE HAS BEEN HEARD ABOUT THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) CROWN PRINCE BILLAH\'S RELATONSHIPS WITH </p><p>BROTHERS/UNCLES, ETC.   CROWN PRINCE BILLAH </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH HIS UNCLES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY PRINCE MOHAMED, THE FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p>HE ALSO APPEARS REGULARLY IN PUBLIC WITH HIS HALF- </p><p>BROTHER, PRINCE AZIM, THE ELDEST SON OF THE </p><p>SULTAN\'S SECOND WIFE, AND WITH PRINCE QAWI, AND </p><p>PRINCE MOHAMED\'S ELDEST SON.  HE DOES NOT, </p><p>HOWEVER, APPEAR TO HAVE VERY CLOSE RELATIONS WITH </p><p>PRINCE HAKIM, THE SON OF PRINCE JEFFRI.  THE </p><p>SULTAN\'S FAMILIES, BY HIS FIRST AND SECOND WIVES, </p><p>SEEM TO BE WELL INTEGRATED.  FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS </p><p>DISPLAYED IN THE PALACES OF THE WIVES INCLUDE </p><p>MEMBERS OF BOTH FAMILIES ENJOYING SOCIAL EVENTS </p><p>TOGETHER. </p><p> </p><p>WRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
