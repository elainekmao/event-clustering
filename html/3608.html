<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001599 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 8/29/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, PINS, PREL, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: Leftist JVP:  Predicts failure of peace talks; </p><p>supports globalization, kind of; US too influential </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, DCM.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During a recent one hour meeting with poloff, JVP </p><p>General Secretary Tilvin Silva outlined his party\'s </p><p>position on a multitude of issues, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- predicting the peace process will fail; </p><p> </p><p>-- dissatisfaction with a proposed constitutional </p><p>amendment limiting the Presidents powers; </p><p> </p><p>-- the USG may have too much influence in Sri Lanka; </p><p> </p><p>-- the ban against LTTE is being lifted too early; </p><p> </p><p>-- economic reform, including privatization and </p><p>globalization; </p><p> </p><p>-- and cohabitation politics. </p><p> </p><p>Peace Process </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Tilvin Silva of the leftist Sinhala-chauvinist </p><p>Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) opened an hour meeting </p><p>by "guaranteeing" that the current peace process would </p><p>fail.  He insisted that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) are only using the current ceasefire to </p><p>extend their reach.  Silva gave examples of the LTTE </p><p>continuing recruitment, repositioning cadre, and having </p><p>access to areas they previously did not.  In his </p><p>opinion, the GSL continues to cede, including on </p><p>transport of cadre by sea, while the LTTE only ended </p><p>open warfare.  He claims that the LTTE continues to </p><p>assassinate Tamils "collaborators".  Silva asserts that </p><p>the LTTE has become proportionately stronger in the </p><p>Tamil community because all Tamil organizations except </p><p>the LTTE have had to give up their weapons. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Silva further commented that until the LTTE </p><p>openly declares that it is not seeking an Eelam there </p><p>will always be distrust of them in the south (i.e. the </p><p>Sinhalese community).  As it now stands the LTTE has no </p><p>desire for a peace settlement; they only want the </p><p>ceasefire to continue for as long as possible.  As long </p><p>as the ceasefire holds they are able to strengthen </p><p>themselves without opposition. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Silva also had numerous complaints about what may </p><p>be discussed in the peace talks.  He explained that </p><p>federalism, in any form, would not work in the present </p><p>situation.  He asserted that whereas internationally </p><p>federalism was used to combine separate entities, in Sri </p><p>Lanka it is creating divides.  The LTTE will only see </p><p>federalism as a first step in creating an Eelam state. </p><p> </p><p>Constitutional Amendment </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Silva stated that the JVP is opposed to both </p><p>parts of the constitutional amendment currently being </p><p>discussed.  (Note: the United National Front --UNF-- is </p><p>proposing an amendment which would limit the President </p><p>powers to dissolve parliament and permit MPs to vote </p><p>outside of party lines in Parliament.)  The JVP\'s </p><p>position, which coincides with the President\'s, is that </p><p>the current executive presidency should be eliminated, </p><p>but the change should be all at once and not </p><p>incremental.  Silva added that those claiming the </p><p>President will call elections as soon as </p><p>constitutionally possible are wrong.  The People\'s </p><p>Alliance (PA), the President\'s party, is not prepared </p><p>for an election.  Silva claimed that the JVP supports a </p><p>call for "conscience" voting in Parliament, but the UNF </p><p>is only calling for conscience voting on certain issues </p><p>and only the UNF, as the majority bloc in Parliament, is </p><p>permitted to decide what those issues are. </p><p> </p><p>USG involvement in Sri Lanka </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) Silva stated that the JVP membership is concerned </p><p>that the current government is more focused on pleasing </p><p>western nations, particularly the U.S., than responding </p><p>to Sri Lankans.  He added that there is a growing </p><p>perception in the south that the Norwegian government is </p><p>working on the instructions of the USG.  Poloff </p><p>responded that the USG is supportive of the work the </p><p>Norwegians are doing in fostering the peace process, but </p><p>it is the GoN that is making the decisions and working </p><p>with the GSL on the peace process. </p><p>Lifting of the Ban on the LTTE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The GSL has stated that it will temporarily lift </p><p>the ban on the LTTE September 6, ten days before peace </p><p>talks are scheduled to commence.  Silva stated that </p><p>until the LTTE lays down its arms and publicly </p><p>repudiates the claim for a separate nation, the ban must </p><p>stay in place.  He dismissed the "temporary" nature of </p><p>the lifting of the ban as pure semantics, either there </p><p>is or there is not a ban.  Silva also confirmed that the </p><p>JVP was planning a protest march against the lifting of </p><p>the ban, but was unwilling to discuss the details of the </p><p>march. </p><p> </p><p>Economic reform </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In a dramatic departure from the JVP\'s </p><p>Marxist/socialist ideological base, Silva stated that </p><p>the JVP was willing to support globalization and </p><p>privatization to reform the Sri Lanka economy.  He </p><p>stated that neither issue was bad in itself, but the way </p><p>the GSL was going about it was.  Silva complained that </p><p>widespread corruption and graft prevents privatization </p><p>from happening in a manner that helps the economy.  He </p><p>further commented that globalization is fine as long as </p><p>the national economy takes steps to make sure it is </p><p>strong enough to compete in the international market. </p><p>Following these grand proclamations, Silva started </p><p>listing measures needed to protect the local market. </p><p> </p><p>Cohabitation </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Silva believes that one reason for the current </p><p>cohabitation difficulties is that PM Wickremesinghe is </p><p>duplicitous.  Wickremesinghe, according to Silva, has a </p><p>very convincing veneer of a gentleman, but uses others </p><p>in his party to attack the President.  Silva conceded </p><p>that Wickremesinghe might not have complete control of </p><p>his party membership and that some ministers may be </p><p>acting on their own.  According to Silva, in the end, </p><p>the problems of cohabitation are because neither side </p><p>acts in a statesman-like manner. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
