<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002819 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J FRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Business Leader Believes Zimbabwe Must Change </p><p>Course </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Jewel Bank CEO Gideon Gono told us he </p><p>believes Zimbabwe\'s macroeconomic imbalances are </p><p>unsustainable over the next 6 months.  Gono\'s frank </p><p>appraisal hints that a dose of reality may be seeping </p><p>through to the country\'s upper echelon.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Ambassador and Econchief met on December 2 </p><p>with Gono, head of a major indigenous bank and confidant </p><p>of President Mugabe.  Gono argued that contradictions in </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s macroeconomic policy could lead to meltdown in </p><p>the next 6 months.  He showed us a document he had </p><p>submitted to Mugabe and other political higher-ups at the </p><p>beginning of 2002, advocating more capital expenditure, </p><p>devaluation of the official exchange rate and </p><p>rapprochement with international lenders.  He also gave </p><p>us a paper he presented to the Reserve Bank last month, </p><p>calling for the granting of title deeds to farmers </p><p>resettled on white commercial farms. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: An acknowledgement from someone who has </p><p>Mugabe\'s ear that GOZ economic and land policies are </p><p>failing is welcome, even though Gono probably couches </p><p>these criticisms in more delicate terms to the President. </p><p>We hope it is an early sign that political higher-ups are </p><p>willing to entertain the notion, at least in private, </p><p>that policies of price controls, overvalued currency, </p><p>chaotic land redistribution and overbearing taxation are </p><p>destroying the economy.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
