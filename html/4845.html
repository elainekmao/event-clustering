<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 003428 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KOMC, ETTC, KCRM, US, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: PROPOSED MUNITIONS EXPORT APPLICATIONS #865798 AND </p><p>#865799 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. TEGUCIGALPA 988 </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 113261 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  Omni Engineering Company, Inc. has applied for </p><p>two (2) licenses to import arms and ammunition to Honduras. </p><p>Application #865798 is a proposed sale of revolvers, pistols </p><p>and rifles to La Armeria (the Honduran distributor/end user) </p><p>valued at $312,500.  Application #865799 is a proposed sale </p><p>of 3,050,000 rounds of ammunition to La Armeria valued at </p><p>$346,500.  After careful consideration, Post recommends that </p><p>neither sale be allowed to go forward.  This recommendation </p><p>is supported by a variety of factors, including the </p><p>inordinately high rate of violent crime, the lack of any </p><p>meaningful arms control or regulation by the government, and </p><p>because La Armeria continues to do business without firm </p><p>purchase orders or sales contracts (in violation of guidance </p><p>provided in Ref B).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>APPLICATION #865798--800 GUNS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  In its application #865798, Omni Engineering Company, </p><p>Inc. (Omni) has applied to import 800 revolvers, pistols and </p><p>rifles.  Omni states that it intends to sell the arms to La </p><p>Armeria--the Honduran distributor/end user for retail sale to </p><p>the general public.  Specifically, Omni seeks to import 400 </p><p>.38/.357 caliber revolvers, 150 .32 caliber pistols, 50 .25 </p><p>caliber pistols and 200 .22 caliber rifles.  The value of the </p><p>proposed sale is $312,500. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>APPLICATION #865799--3,050,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  Omni has applied to import 3,050,000 rounds of </p><p>ammunition, including 2,000,000 rounds .22 caliber, 100,000 </p><p>rounds .30 caliber, 100,000 rounds .40 caliber, 300,000 </p><p>rounds 9mm, 50,000 rounds .223 (5.56) caliber, 400,000 rounds </p><p>.357 caliber and 100,000 rounds .380 caliber.  In its </p><p>application, Omni proposes to sell the ammunition, valued at </p><p>$346,500, to La Armeria. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>RATIONALE FOR DENIAL OF APPLICATIONS #865798 AND #856799 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>THE PROBLEM OF NO CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The primary problem that exists for Omni (as well as for </p><p>other U.S. arms exporters) is that La Armeria has not yet </p><p>rectified its problematic procedures for doing business. </p><p>There is no actual contract for sale or firm purchase order </p><p>for these items.  It is the standard operating procedure of </p><p>La Armeria (the purported initial purchaser) not/repeat not </p><p>to enter into firm contract of sale, but rather routinely </p><p>makes projections of arms and munitions that it might or </p><p>might not need and might or might not purchase. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Post\'s investigations have indicated that La Armeria </p><p>routinely obtains "quotes" or "bids" from more than one arms </p><p>manufacturer for exactly the same arms.  Thereafter, they </p><p>might or might not purchase the arms from one or more of the </p><p>companies that gave them quotes.  These two applications </p><p>appear to be two more of those cases where La Armeria has </p><p>provided the potential seller (here, Omni) with mere </p><p>projections, and that no contracts for sale exist. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Post understands that relevant regulations provide that, </p><p>in order to obtain a license from the Department of State, </p><p>the U.S. firm or individual seeking an export license must </p><p>have a firm purchase order or sales contract from the buyer. </p><p>Moreover, letters of intent, invoices unconfirmed statements </p><p>of purchase projections of likely purchases are not </p><p>sufficient to meet the requirements for issuance of such a </p><p>license.  Via Ref B, The Department of State clarified this </p><p>issue for Post, after Post sought guidance with respect to </p><p>this La Armeria dilemma in Ref A. </p><p> </p><p>A SOLUTION IN THE OFFING? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  La Armeria is aware of the problem.  In addition to </p><p>having been advised by Post, officials from Remington Arms </p><p>traveled to Honduras in October to visit with officials at La </p><p>Armeria in an attempt to rectify the problem.  Additionally, </p><p>on October 2, PolOffs met with the Remington officials in </p><p>order to provide them with any information that might help </p><p>solve the dilemma.  At this meeting, PolOffs were advised by </p><p>the Remington representatives that the La Armeria officials </p><p>had promised them that they would immediately begin issuing </p><p>specific, firm contracts for sale and/or purchase orders.  To </p><p>date, La Armeria has not instituted the necessary changes. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Post remains hopeful that La Armeria will soon correct </p><p>the problem.  On December 19, PolOffs were approached by </p><p>Colonel Carlos Humberto Ramos, Commander of the Honduran Air </p><p>Force (who is the President of the Board of La Armeria), who </p><p>expressed concern and dismay regarding the problems faced by </p><p>U.S. arms exporters.  PolOffs explained the issue to Colonel </p><p>Ramos, and he indicated that there should be not problem </p><p>correcting the problem within La Armeria.  PolOffs and </p><p>Colonel Ramos agreed to schedule a meeting in early January </p><p>to reach a definitive solution once and for all. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>IN THE MEANTIME... </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  Until La Armeria succeeds in changing its internal </p><p>methods in a manner that complies with Department of State </p><p>requirements, the importation of arms and ammunition from </p><p>U.S. manufacturers will continue to be problematic and in </p><p>violation of current guidance.  In the meantime, Post once </p><p>again recommends that the pending Omni applications be denied </p><p>for the reasons stated herein. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
