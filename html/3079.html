<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HANOI 001454 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL/IRF AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, SOCI, VM, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: EVANGELICAL PASTOR\'S VIEWS ON HOUSE CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS AN AMCONGEN HO CHI MINH CITY CABLE.  CLASSIFIED BY EMI </p><p>YAMAUCHI, CONSUL GENERAL, REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) PASTOR NGUYEN HONG QUANG, CHAIRMAN OF THE MENNONITE CHURCH AND </p><p>MEMBER OF THE VIETNAM EVANGELICAL FELLOWSHIP OF HOUSE CHURCHES (VEF), </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01454  060431Z </p><p>RECENTLY VISITED THE CONGEN.  THE VEF IS NOT REGISTERED WITH THE GVN </p><p>AND IS THEREFORE NOT A RECOGNIZED RELIGION.  QUANG, WHO IS A RELATIVELY </p><p>NEW BUT SEEMINGLY RELIABLE RELIGIOUS ACTIVIST, BROUGHT ALONG PHOTOS AND </p><p>"TESTIMONIES" OF TWO HOUSE CHURCH PASTORS WHO HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO </p><p>HARASSMENT AND/OR BEATINGS IN HO CHI MINH CITY AND KON TUM PROVINCE IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. POST IS IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>TRANSLATING/SUMMARIZING THE 25-PLUS PAGES OF DOCUMENTS, POLICE </p><p>COMPLAINTS, ETC. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) QUANG IS PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TWO VICTIMS.  THE HCMC </p><p>VICTIM IS A HOUSE CHURCH PASTOR WHOSE HOME WAS RAIDED BY POLICE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO QUANG, THE HCMC PASTOR WAS THREATENED BUT NOT HARMED.  THE </p><p>POLICE INSTEAD WALKED OFF WITH HIS TELEVISION SET, RADIO, AND OTHER </p><p>HOUSEHOLD EFFECTS.  (POST NOTE: POST HAS HEARD SIMILAR STORIES IN THE </p><p>PAST ABOUT CONFISCATED TELEVISIONS, BICYCLES, ETC. IN THE PROVINCES, </p><p>BUT SUCH OCCURRENCES ARE SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL IN HCMC.)  HE WAS WARNED TO </p><p>STOP ILLEGAL RELIGIOUS MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE KON TUM PROVINCE VICTIM WAS A HOUSE CHURCH PASTOR WHOSE </p><p>MOTORCYCLE WAS RUN OFF THE ROAD, ALLEGEDLY BY PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN. </p><p>THE PASTOR WAS TAKEN TO JAIL FOR "CAUSING" THE ACCIDENT, AND WAS BEATEN </p><p>BADLY ENOUGH TO BE ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL, ACCORDING TO QUANG. </p><p>ENCLOSED WITH THE KON TUM PROVINCE VICTIM\'S TESTIMONY WERE PHOTOS, </p><p>WHICH CLEARLY SHOWED CUTS AND BRUISES ON THE HEAD AND NECK, AND TORN </p><p>CLOTHING. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS FROM THE CG, QUANG RESPONDED: </p><p> </p><p>-- HE HIMSELF HAS HAD MEETINGS WITH GVN AUTHORITIES FROM THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF PUBLIC SECURITY (MPS), THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS, </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEMBERS, ETC.  HE BELIEVES THAT AT THE NATIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01454  060431Z </p><p>LEVEL, THE GVN IS MAKING AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND THE HOUSE CHURCH </p><p>EVANGELICAL MOVEMENT AND TO IMPROVE TREATMENT OF "NON-REGISTERED </p><p>RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS." </p><p> </p><p>-- IN SPITE OF THE ABOVE CASE OF HARASSMENT IN HCMC, QUANG BELIEVES THE </p><p>LEVEL AND FREQUENCY OF SUCH INCIDENTS HAVE DECLINED GRADUALLY THIS </p><p>YEAR.  AS PROOF, HE SHOWED US HIS NEW "HOUSEHOLD REGISTRATION" BOOKLET, </p><p>WHICH MAKES HIM AN OFFICIAL HCMC RESIDENT.  THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN </p><p>POSSIBLE, HE NOTED, WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE HCMC RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, HE BELIEVES THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH </p><p>CHANGE.  HARASSMENT AND BEATINGS OCCUR WHEN POLICE DISCOVER "ILLEGAL </p><p>MEETINGS" HOSTED BY UNREGISTERED HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) QUANG DID NOT WISH US TO RAISE THESE SPECIFIC CASES WITH </p><p>VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES.  HE SAID IT WAS ENOUGH THAT THE USG WAS "AWARE </p><p>OF THESE INCIDENTS" AND THAT WE WOULD "RECORD THESE PROBLEMS" FOR THE </p><p>ANNUAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORTS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN RESPONSE TO CG\'S QUESTION ABOUT ANOTHER VISIT TO THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS, QUANG INDICATED THAT THE FELLOWSHIP OF HOUSE CHURCHES WAS </p><p>PLANNING A CONFERENCE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IN LATE JUNE.  IF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WENT SMOOTHLY, THE FELLOWSHIP\'S EXECUTIVE BOARD WOULD SEEK </p><p>TO MEET WITH PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS.  IN THE MEANTIME, FOR HIS </p><p>FELLOWSHIP\'S OWN PURPOSES, HE DID NOT BELIEVE CALLING INCREASED </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE HIGHLANDS WAS HELPFUL.  HE SEEMED CERTAIN THAT THE KON </p><p>TUM PASTOR WOULD WELCOME A VISIT FROM CONGENOFFS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: QUANG, WHO MET WITH THE COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM THIS PAST FEBRUARY, HAS IMPRESSED US AS A SERIOUS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01454  060431Z </p><p>DETERMINED CRUSADER FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THIS WAS, HOWEVER, OUR </p><p>FIRST MEETING WITH HIM ALONE (USUALLY HE IS WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER </p><p>PASTORS OF OTHER PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS).  HE DREW A CLEAR LINE </p><p>BETWEEN THE GVN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES - WHETHER THEY </p><p>WERE OFFICIALS OF THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEES, MINISTRY OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY, PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES, OR POLICE DEPARTMENT.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN SOME MODEST PROGRESS IN MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING WITH GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS, AND SHOWED US PHOTOS OF SEVERAL HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS AT </p><p>MEETINGS WITH MPS, PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES, AND RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEES IN HANOI.  QUANG IS FINDING IT JUST AS DIFFICULT AS WE DO, </p><p>HOWEVER, TO FIGURE OUT WHO EXACTLY CONTROLS EACH OF THE PROVINCIAL, </p><p>DISTRICT, VILLAGE, AND HAMLET PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES/COUNCILS, POLICE </p><p>DEPARTMENTS, AND RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEES -- AND HOW THE GVN CAN </p><p>COMMUNICATE ITS OWN INCREMENTAL ATTITUDE CHANGES EFFECTIVELY TO THEM. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
