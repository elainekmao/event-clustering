<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001119 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: REHABILITATING A CONTROVERSIAL CROWN PRINCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 KATHMANDU 2115 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C/NF) Summary.  Visiting USAID consultant Dr. Scott </p><p>Palmer briefed Nepal\'s Crown Prince Paras May 30 on </p><p>similarities between Nepal\'s Maoists and Peru\'s Shining Path. </p><p> The meeting marked Paras\' first formal contact with U.S. </p><p>officials as Crown Prince.  (Note:  Nepal\'s Royal Palace has </p><p>asked that the meeting remain a secret.  End Note.)  Paras </p><p>mostly kept his counsel, but showed a keen interest in </p><p>learning how Nepal might respond to the Maoist crisis.  Paras </p><p>traveled recently to London - twice - and sat in when the </p><p>head of British defense called on King Gyanendra, U.K. Charge </p><p>confirmed.  A controversial figure who has been accused of </p><p>hit-and-run murder and pistol-whipping a policeman, Paras has </p><p>begun to step into his new public role as Crown Prince, </p><p>inaugurating a public event June 5.  The King has given Paras </p><p>his old job as Chairman of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature </p><p>Conservation and entrusted a long-time confidant with </p><p>overseeing Paras\' personal and professional rehabilitation. </p><p>Administrative changes at the Palace following the June 1, </p><p>2001 massacre make it difficult to establish contacts with </p><p>aides to the royals.  Paras remains widely despised, but in </p><p>ways both public and private King Gyanendra has demonstrated </p><p>that he intends to stand behind his son.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>USAID Consultant Briefs Crown Prince </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C/NF) Nepal\'s Crown Prince Paras met with Boston </p><p>University Professor Scott Palmer, USAID Program Director, </p><p>and Poloff May 30.  It was Paras\' first formal encounter with </p><p>U.S. officials as Crown Prince.  The meeting, which lasted </p><p>just over an hour, took place at the offices of the King </p><p>Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), a </p><p>quasi-governmental conservation organization founded by </p><p>Paras\' father, King Gyanendra.  Paras serves as Chairman of </p><p>the KMTNC, a post Gyanendra occupied until assuming the </p><p>throne one year ago.  Also present were Arup Rajouria, KMTNC </p><p>Member Secretary, and a KMTNC staffer who served as </p><p>notetaker.  (Note:  Paras\' handlers indicated that they </p><p>wanted the meeting to remain secret.  Strictly protect.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C/NF) Professor Palmer, in Nepal as a consultant to USAID </p><p>conflict resolution programs, briefed the Crown Prince on </p><p>similarities between Maoist movements in Nepal and Peru, </p><p>focussing on the Peruvian government response to the crisis </p><p>and developmental efforts that contributed to the eventual </p><p>dissolution of the Shining Path movement. </p><p> </p><p>Prince of Few Words </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C/NF) Paras asked a few short, direct questions, but - </p><p>whether out of insecurity or a desire not to show his hand - </p><p>did not say very much.  He was most interested to know what </p><p>Nepal could do in response to the Maoist crisis, and asked </p><p>for elaboration of the similarities between the Nepalese and </p><p>Peruvian cases.  He listened actively, nodding his head, </p><p>expressing agreement and often filling in words during pauses </p><p>in the Professor\'s presentation.  His attention started to </p><p>fade after about forty minutes; at that point Rajouria </p><p>launched into a monologue about KMTNC programs and their </p><p>similarity to the development efforts in Peru described by </p><p>Palmer.  Immediately following the meeting, Paras reportedly </p><p>went to the Palace to meet and brief his father. </p><p> </p><p>Close to British, Twice in London </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C/NF) To date, Paras, only other official contact with </p><p>representatives of foreign governments occurred in Britain, </p><p>where he traveled twice this year, once on an official visit </p><p>hosted by Prince Charles and again to attend the funeral of </p><p>the Queen Mother.  British Charge told Poloff that the first </p><p>visit had come at the initiative of Buckingham Palace.  The </p><p>two royal families have close ties, the Charge explained. </p><p>When visiting British Chief of Defense Staff General Sir </p><p>Michael Boyce called on King Gyanendra in late May, Charge </p><p>related, Paras had sat in on the meeting.  RNA contacts told </p><p>the British that the event marked that first time the Crown </p><p>Prince had joined his father at a formal call. </p><p> </p><p>Rehabilitating a Reckless Youth </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Paras remains a controversial figure in Nepal </p><p>(Reftel).  In August, 2000, he allegedly ran over and killed </p><p>a popular musician after an argument in a bar.  Previous </p><p>reports accuse him of running down one or two others and </p><p>pistol-whipping a police officer.  Because of this history, </p><p>many accused Paras of having a hand in the massacre of much </p><p>of Nepal,s royal family on June 1, 2001.  (Note:  Paras, who </p><p>was close to the late Crown Prince Dipendra, was present at </p><p>the family gathering at which nine members of the royal </p><p>family, including the King and Queen, were killed and several </p><p>others injured.  He was not himself injured.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The Palace is trying hard to rehabilitate both </p><p>Paras, image and his character.  After his father named him </p><p>Crown Prince October 26, 2001, (Reftel) his first public </p><p>appearance was at a December 6 program to mark his former </p><p>high school\'s anniversary.  After that he mostly kept out of </p><p>sight, occasionally stepping out to worship at religious </p><p>sites.  He reportedly meets with tutors daily, though mostly </p><p>to learn the ins-and-outs of court protocol and palace </p><p>management. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) A milestone occurred on June 5 Paras when </p><p>inaugurated an event to mark "World Environment Day" at the </p><p>convention center in Kathmandu named for his uncle, the late </p><p>King Birendra.  Paras lit a ceremonial lamp and handed out </p><p>awards, but did not speak.  The occasion marked Paras\' first </p><p>solo public appearance as Crown Prince and was intensely </p><p>covered by the media.  (Note:  The previous Crown Prince, </p><p>Dipendra, often presided at such events.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Learning the Ropes, in Dad\'s Old Job </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (C/NF) As the Chairman of the KMTNC - a position formerly </p><p>occupied by his father, the King, who founded the trust - </p><p>Paras devotes considerable time learning about the </p><p>organization,s environmental and conservation work. </p><p>Previously Paras was head of Kathmandu\'s Central Zoo, which </p><p>falls under the administration of the KMTNC.  The KMTNC </p><p>Member Secretary, Arup Rajouria, an old confidant of King </p><p>Gyanendra, has been charged with managing Paras\' professional </p><p>development.  (Note:  Rajouria was at the Kennedy School at </p><p>Harvard in the early 90s when Paras was attending boarding </p><p>school in New York.  Gyanendra would order the future Crown </p><p>Prince to travel to Cambridge on the weekends, so the </p><p>Rajourias could watch over him.  They let him sleep on a </p><p>fold-out bed in the living room.  End Note.)  Besides </p><p>arranging for Paras\' orientation into his new </p><p>responsibilities, Rajouria has also pushed for Paras to move </p><p>out into the public eye.  Rajouria was the impetus for Paras\' </p><p>participation in the June 5 environmental event.  In </p><p>conversations with Poloff, Rajouria insists that the events </p><p>of the past year have matured Paras, and the Crown Prince has </p><p>become more disciplined and serious of late. </p><p> </p><p>New System at Palace Isolates Royals </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Much more was known about the previous Crown Prince, </p><p>Diprendra.  His Aide-de-Camp (ADC) met frequently with </p><p>members of the diplomatic corps, and Dipendra himself </p><p>socialized with foreign residents.  Nepal\'s royals have kept </p><p>a low profile following the June 1, 2001 royal family </p><p>massacre, and now that Paras has become Crown Prince, he </p><p>stays away from Kathmandu,s nightspots.  Moreover, after the </p><p>June 1 incident the palace,s ADC system was revamped.  ADCs </p><p>now rotate among members of the royal family, so that no </p><p>single ADC develops too close a relationship with any single </p><p>individual.  (Note:  Several ADCs were faulted - and </p><p>disciplined - both for failing to prevent the June 1 massacre </p><p>and for enabling late Crown Prince Dipendra\'s destructive </p><p>behavior.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C/NF) While the institution of the monarchy is deeply </p><p>revered in Nepal, Paras himself is widely despised.  The </p><p>Palace apparently hopes that by rehabilitating both the man </p><p>and his image, the populace will eventually accept him as a </p><p>royal in good standing.  Paras has begun taking a few </p><p>tentative steps out into the public eye, but is still kept </p><p>muzzled and away from the press.  The Palace likely took note </p><p>of the publicity surrounding Professor Palmer\'s visit to </p><p>Nepal - his meeting with the Prime Minister (which included </p><p>top military brass) and a public speech to a foreign affairs </p><p>organization were covered in the media.  The Palace thus </p><p>likely saw Palmer\'s stealth briefing for the Crown Prince as </p><p>a contribution to the young dauphin\'s education, and also as </p><p>a way to boost his self-esteem.  Paras\' road to </p><p>rehabilitation will be long and mostly uphill. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
