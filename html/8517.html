<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 GUATEMALA 001435 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p>USTR FOR BUD CLATANOFF </p><p>USDOL FOR ILAB: JORGE PEREZ-LOPEZ AND ROBERT WHOLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ELAB, ETRD, CASC, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSISTANT SECRETARY STRUBLE\'S MAY 29-31 VISIT TO </p><p>GUATEMALA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Counselor David Lindwall. Reason 1.5 (b&d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  During a May 29-31 visit to Guatemala, to </p><p>participate in a WHA Entry Level Conference, Acting Assistant </p><p>Secretary Curt Struble met with Vice President Reyes Lopez, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Acting Foreign Minister Aguilera and Minister of Interior </p><p>Reyes Calderon to discuss the full range of bilateral issues. </p><p> Vice President Reyes reiterated the Portillo </p><p>Administration\'s desire to complete free trade negotiations </p><p>with us by November, 2003, and said that the GOG would </p><p>conclude a maritime counternarcotics agreement with the U.S. </p><p>during the first week of June.  In a call on human rights </p><p>leader Helen Mack, AA/S Struble expressed USG support for </p><p>Mack\'s efforts to obtain justice in the case of her sister, </p><p>who was murdered by security forces in 1990, and the creation </p><p>of an international mission to investigate the actions of </p><p>clandestine forces that have threatened human rights workers </p><p>in recent years.  AA/S Struble and the Ambassador secured </p><p>assurances from Attorney General de Leon that greater </p><p>attention would be given to the investigation of the murders </p><p>of American Citizens and labor union members.  De Leon also </p><p>described the ongoing investigation of a major corruption </p><p>case at the Social Security Institute that could implicate </p><p>important political sectors.  Press attention during the </p><p>visit focused on USG concerns over a possible Rios Montt </p><p>presidency and satisfaction with improvements in </p><p>counternarcotics cooperation.  The visit brought attention </p><p>both publicly and privately to the need for concrete actions </p><p>to advance critical issues on the bilateral agenda in the </p><p>remaining eight months of the Portillo Administration.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Vice President Anxious to Conclude Free Trade Negotiations </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Vice President Francisco Reyes Lopez, accompanied by </p><p>Acting Foreign Minister Gabriel Aguilera and Minister of </p><p>Interior Reyes Calderon, hosted a lunch at the Presidential </p><p>Palace for AA/S Struble, the Ambassador and PolCouns </p><p>(notetaker) on May 30.  Reyes said that the Portillo </p><p>Administration is firmly committed to completing a free trade </p><p>agreement with the United States (CAFTA), and would like to </p><p>conclude the negotiation as soon as possible.  Reyes noted </p><p>that President Portillo will be handing over power to a new </p><p>president in January 2004, and that by November 30, 2003, </p><p>Congress will out of session.  He said the GOG is prepared to </p><p>increase the pace of negotiations in order to complete them </p><p>by the end of October, 2003, giving the Guatemalan Congress a </p><p>month to ratify the agreement.  Reyes fears that if an </p><p>agreement is not concluded by then, it will be difficult to </p><p>get the current Congress to approve it, and the next Congress </p><p>is expected to be much more fractured than the current one. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AA/S Struble and the Ambassador praised the Guatemalan </p><p>negotiating team, and said that Guatemala\'s positions at the </p><p>most recent round of talks had moved the negotiation </p><p>significantly forward.  The Vice President agreed, but said </p><p>that the GOG still has some concerns over potential losses to </p><p>its agricultural sector.  He described how, during a visit to </p><p>Iowa, he was amazed at the US potential for producing corn. </p><p>He said Guatemala could never compete against the US in corn </p><p>production, yet 50% of Guatemalans are corn farmers.  Lopez </p><p>argued that an agreement that did not take into consideration </p><p>Guatemala\'s particular agricultural needs would only lead to </p><p>increased rural poverty and more immigration to the United </p><p>States.  AA/S Struble commented that during the April 10 </p><p>meeting between President Bush and the Central American </p><p>presidents, President Bush said emphatically that the US does </p><p>not want an agreement that disfavors Central America.  USG </p><p>policy is to negotiate an agreement that is beneficial to </p><p>both sides.  Struble also noted AID\'s efforts to coordinate </p><p>its development assistance strategy to the needs of CAFTA, </p><p>but he warned that inefficient producers are going to come </p><p>under pressure with or without CAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador told the Guatemalans that the USG was </p><p>pleased with the increase in counternarcotics cooperation in </p><p>recent months.  He noted that we are close to signing a </p><p>maritime counternarcotics cooperation agreement, and </p><p>expressed hope that the GOG would ratify this agreement in </p><p>the coming days.  Acting Foreign Minister Aguilera said that </p><p>the MFA expects to have an agreed text ready to send to </p><p>Congress for ratification by June 4 (Note: In Guatemala, </p><p>Congressional ratification of international agreements </p><p>precedes signature by the President. End note).  Vice </p><p>President Reyes said that much has been done, but </p><p>acknowledged that much remains to be done to deny the use of </p><p>Guatemala to the traffickers as a transit point for drugs </p><p>heading north.  He made a pitch for greater USG financial </p><p>assistance to the counter-drug effort in Guatemala.  The </p><p>Ambassador commented that recently passed asset forfeiture </p><p>legislation, if properly applied, would generate far more </p><p>resources for the law enforcement purposes than the U.S. </p><p>would ever be able to provide.  He urged the Guatemalans to </p><p>begin implementing this law and to use the proceeds </p><p>effectively to fight drugs. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On other matters, AA/S Struble expressed concern for </p><p>the slow movement by GOG authorities to investigate the </p><p>murders of 13 AmCits in the past three years, and called on </p><p>the Vice President to use the Executive\'s influence with the </p><p>Attorney General and the Courts to give serious attention to </p><p>these cases.  He noted that the USG is also concerned about </p><p>the recent murders of several labor leaders and the lack of </p><p>effective investigation of their cases.  AA/S Struble told </p><p>Vice President Reyes that labor rights are a fundamental </p><p>concern of the U.S. in Guatemala, and that the potential GSP </p><p>review and ongoing CAFTA negotiations brought more attention </p><p>to Guatemala\'s labor situation.  Vice President Reyes </p><p>acknowledged that more needs to be done to protect labor </p><p>rights, and went on to list the Portillo Government\'s </p><p>accomplishments in this field (e.g. passage of a new labor </p><p>code, increases in the minimum wage, lowering of requirements </p><p>for establishing new unions, etc.). </p><p> </p><p>Helen Mack Describes Long Road Ahead for Human Rights </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Accompanied by Ambassador and PolOffs, AA/S Struble </p><p>visited the Myrna Mack Foundation to discuss with Foundation </p><p>Director Helen Mack recent developments in the Myrna Mack </p><p>case, progress in establishing the proposed commission to </p><p>investigate clandestine groups (CICIACS) and widespread </p><p>concerns about the failure of the justice system and </p><p>continuing impunity.  Mack thanked AA/S Struble for his visit </p><p>and the sustained USG public support, both from Washington </p><p>and the Embassy.  Mack said that she was disappointed by the </p><p>recent reversal of the October 2002 conviction that she and </p><p>her legal team had won against the alleged intellectual </p><p>authors of her sister\'s murder.  She also explained the </p><p>appeal process before the Supreme Court, which she filed on </p><p>May 28, in which she asked the court to uphold the earlier </p><p>conviction of retired Colonel Valencia Osorio and his former </p><p>EMP (Presidential Military Guard) supervisor, retired General </p><p>Godoy Gaitan.  Mack anticipates that no decision will be made </p><p>on her appeal until after the November 2003 elections and the </p><p>installation of a new government in January of 2004.  AA/S </p><p>Struble expressed USG disappointment in the recent setback in </p><p>the Mack case, and the hope that the Guatemalan judicial </p><p>system would soon find the intellectual authors responsible </p><p>for the crime. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In regard to CICIACS, Mack opined that the most </p><p>important effect the CICIACS could have would be to expose </p><p>publicly the existence of the organized criminal structures </p><p>that are undermining the rule of law in Guatemala, and </p><p>beginning to remove those structures from the positions of </p><p>power they currently enjoy, thanks to their connections in </p><p>the government.  She thanked AA/S Struble for the commitment </p><p>of USG financial and political support for this endeavor. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Mack said that she did not have high expectations that </p><p>the recent Consultative Group Meeting would spur the </p><p>government of President Alfonso Portillo to make significant </p><p>progress in implementing remaining elements of the peace </p><p>accords during its final eight months in office.  She opined </p><p>that little improvement would be made in administration of </p><p>justice in Guatemala unless the international financial </p><p>institutions conditioned their loans on concrete improvement </p><p>in the administration of justice.  Mack does not believe </p><p>sufficient incentives are currently in place to bring about </p><p>improvements in administration of justice, and that the only </p><p>tool that is likely to have sufficient leverage is </p><p>conditionality on IFI loans.  She expressed thanks for the </p><p>support of the international community which used the </p><p>Consultative Group Meeting to press the GOG for concrete </p><p>reforms, but said that unless Guatemalans overcome their </p><p>apathy and begin to take ownership of resolving these </p><p>problems themselves, this government and future governments </p><p>would have little incentive to respond. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Following the meeting, AA/S Struble spoke with </p><p>reporters and reaffirmed the priority the USG attaches to the </p><p>promotion and defense of human rights in Guatemala.  Calling </p><p>Helen "a national treasure," Struble lauded her role in </p><p>seeking justice in human rights cases and working to end the </p><p>impunity that has long overshadowed human rights cases in </p><p>Guatemala. </p><p> </p><p>Attorney General Promises Greater Attention to AmCit and </p><p>Labor Cases </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) AA/S Struble and the Ambassador met on May 29 with </p><p>Attorney General Carlos de Leon Argueta to congratulate the </p><p>GOG on recent improvements in counter-narcotics cooperation </p><p>and to encourage stronger efforts by the Public Ministry to </p><p>investigate unsolved murders of U.S. citizens, Guatemalan </p><p>labor leaders, and to ensure the independence of a GOG </p><p>forensic laboratory which will receive USG funding.  He told </p><p>de Leon that the USG, Congress and civil society are </p><p>concerned about unsolved murders of AmCits (13 in the past </p><p>three years) and lagging investigations of murdered labor </p><p>leaders in Guatemala.  AA/S Struble requested that the GOG </p><p>make further efforts to combat and prevent these crimes by </p><p>ending the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators.  AA/S Struble </p><p>further noted that an AFL-CIO petition to withdraw </p><p>Guatemala\'s GSP trade benefits is currently under review, and </p><p>Congressional approval of an eventual free trade agreement </p><p>with Central America will draw increased attention to labor </p><p>rights protections in the region.  AA/S Struble noted a </p><p>growing recognition by some in Central America (he cited </p><p>Salvadoran President Flores in an April 11 meeting between </p><p>Central American presidents and President Bush) that Central </p><p>American governments need to do a better job convincing U.S. </p><p>NGOs and the AFL-CIO that a CAFTA will enhance protection of </p><p>labor rights in the region.  The Ambassador went on to </p><p>encourage de Leon to devote more resources to combat money </p><p>laundering. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) De Leon said that he was reviewing the progress of </p><p>the special prosecutor investigating the murder of AmCits, </p><p>and will replace him if insufficient progress is revealed. </p><p>To combat impunity the Ministry had added 100 new </p><p>prosecutors, including six dedicated to money laundering </p><p>investigations.  A new Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against </p><p>Trade Unionists and Journalists and supporting team had </p><p>recently been appointed, and is already making progress, </p><p>pursuing arrest warrants, judicial processes and trials. </p><p>Some of the crimes against union leaders, for example the </p><p>murder of the head of the municipal union of Nueva </p><p>Concepcion, Escuintla province in November 2002, were </p><p>motivated not by anti-union motives but by a power struggle </p><p>within organized crime, he said.  Arrests have already been </p><p>made in that case, which involved 16 murders.  De Leon </p><p>expressed GOG gratitude for support from the Ambassador and </p><p>DEA which has resulted in record seizures of drugs and cash </p><p>in recent months.  He also cited the Ministry\'s efforts to </p><p>prosecute human rights crimes, citing the successful </p><p>prosecution of 16 former agents of the anti-narcotics police </p><p>for abuse of authority in the Chocon case. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) De Leon said he was optimistic about what the </p><p>Ministry could accomplish over the remaining three years of </p><p>his term.  However, although the Public Ministry had </p><p>substantially improved its human resources since his arrival, </p><p>it still lacked sufficient funding to provide adequate </p><p>national coverage.  The average prosecutor must handle 1,500 </p><p>cases per year, and the Ministry budget can only afford an </p><p>average expenditure of $130 per case.  Nevertheless, the </p><p>Ministry had launched low-cost initiatives to extend the rule </p><p>of law.  For example, the ministry recently ran a public </p><p>information campaign to combat intra-family violence; </p><p>complaints by battered women shot up 400% as a result.  De </p><p>Leon said his other priorities include the creation of a new </p><p>FBI-like institution within the Public Ministry and combating </p><p>corruption.  He claimed to be resisting overtures from </p><p>corrupt elements within the Presidential Guard (EMP) and to </p><p>have instituted procedures to prevent the disappearance of </p><p>seized assets.  "In this job I cannot have friends or </p><p>enemies, I must apply the law equally to everyone," he said. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) De Leon said that the current IGSS scandal (involving </p><p>the theft of over $30 million from the Social Security </p><p>Institute) shows that the GOG\'s system to detect and </p><p>investigate money laundering works.  All the IGSS funds </p><p>diverted to illicit and overseas accounts have been </p><p>recovered, he said.  He gave AA/S Struble a list of the banks </p><p>and sums of money identified (including Citibank) totaling </p><p>$17.4 million, and said that money laundering statues </p><p>provided the Public Ministry new powers to take measures to </p><p>freeze illicit accounts.  The Ministry had executed over 20 </p><p>raids and seized computer records and other evidence of the </p><p>fraud committed by IGSS officials.  The Ministry will arrest </p><p>Carlos Wholers, an FRG Deputy and then-President of the IGSS </p><p>board of directors (named by President Portillo), as well as </p><p>the other members of the board of directors on May 30.  AA/S </p><p>Struble encouraged the GOG to recoup workers\' funds and </p><p>punish those responsible. </p><p> </p><p>Press Questions Focus on Rios Montt Presidential Candidacy </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) At a press roundtable attended by 20 reporters on May </p><p>30, most questions focused on a recent statement by State </p><p>Department Spokesman Boucher to the effect that if former </p><p>General Efrain Rios Montt were elected President in the </p><p>upcoming election, the United States would have a difficult </p><p>relationship with his government.  Reporters also asked about </p><p>the status of Guatemalan counternarcotics cooperation (and </p><p>the possibility of Guatemala regaining certification as a </p><p>cooperating partner in the war on drugs) and USG objectives </p><p>in the ongoing free trade talks. AA/S Struble addressed the </p><p>question about Rios Montt by reading the State Department\'s </p><p>earlier statement and saying it speaks for itself.  On </p><p>counternarcotics cooperation, AA/S Struble told reporters </p><p>that there have been several concrete improvements in </p><p>counternarcotics cooperation in recent months, and that the </p><p>USG would evaluate this progress at the appropriate time.  In </p><p>response to questions about CAFTA, AA/S Struble noted the </p><p>firm commitment of President Bush to securing an agreement </p><p>that is good for both sides.  AA/S Struble\'s statements </p><p>played prominently in all the papers and radio on May 31. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>15. (C) The visit of Acting Assistant Secretary Struble </p><p>brought attention, both publicly and privately, to the need </p><p>for the Portillo Administration to focus efforts in a number </p><p>of concrete areas of our bilateral agenda in its remaining </p><p>eight months in office -- namely, successful completion of </p><p>free trade negotiations, continued progress in </p><p>counternarcotics cooperation, effective promotion of human </p><p>rights (including the establishment of CICIACS), and </p><p>investigation of the murders of American citizens and labor </p><p>union leaders.  As national elections begin to distract the </p><p>Government and other political actors from the task of </p><p>addressing critical areas of our bilateral agenda, the </p><p>Embassy will press the government and Attorney General to </p><p>keep their eye on the ball to ensure that their commitments </p><p>result in concrete actions. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) This cable was cleared by AA/S Struble prior to his </p><p>departure from post. </p><p>MCFARLAND </p><p></p></div>
