<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000825 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/PDA  (BUCKLEY), WHA/CEN, PD TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ, APRIL 2, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Regular columnist Wilmer Perez Regalado in liberal </p><p>party San Pedro Sula-based daily "La Prensa," 4/2 - </p><p>"Madness - War machine of war:" "In the war of George Bush </p><p>against Saddam Hussein, for both "axes of evil".. apparently </p><p>the God they implore and at times manipulate to do what they </p><p>want is a sanguinary, genocidal and blind God that has no </p><p>love for humanity. It is a God called Yahv or Al  brought </p><p>down to the size of their hallucinating minds". </p><p> </p><p>"Bush led a unruly adolescent life, the product of his </p><p>father\'s money, which was dedicated to the exploitation of </p><p>U.S. oil. He gave up amphetamines and alcohol when he was </p><p>forty years old; then he turned political and was elected </p><p>governor of Texas and then President.  After giving up </p><p>addiction, he became religious, which now permits him to </p><p>"talk" to his God and consult him about personal decisions </p><p>and, more gravely, political plans." </p><p> </p><p>On the other hand Saddam, a fanatic Muslim accustomed of </p><p>war, is an orphan who grew up with an uncle with pro-nazi </p><p>ideas who taught him a purified nationalism. His ascent to </p><p>power was fed by the western powers providing him raw </p><p>material to build chemical and biological weapons in the </p><p>fight against the Khomeni of Iran, enemy of the U.S., then </p><p>against Kurds and Shiites. He considers himself as a Jihad </p><p>or "holy war" spiritual leader against the infidels.  Saddam </p><p>and Bush are two peas in a pod, or two tears in an </p><p>unredeemed world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. President of the Honduran Council of Private Enterprise </p><p>Jacobo Regalado was interviewed for "La Prensa" daily </p><p>economic section, 4/2 - "War in Iraq still has not impacted </p><p>national commerce-- we can confirm that there hasn\'t been </p><p>any negative impact that could affect our business in the </p><p>international market.  That is because in the first days of </p><p>the war saw a positive impact in the reduction of oil prices </p><p>to $26.99.  However, some analysts have raised the </p><p>possibility that if the conflict takes a long time, oil </p><p>prices could increase." </p><p> </p><p>3. Regular columnist Mario Alvarado in "El Heraldo" moderate </p><p>Tegucigalpa-based daily, 4/2 - "The other Globalization": </p><p>the garb of the current globalization project depends on the </p><p>system developed by the western social-political forces: </p><p>Democracy. After the collapse of East European socialism, </p><p>societies in a large part of the world have tried to find a </p><p>solution to their economic social, and political problems </p><p>within this system. But it also has served international </p><p>capitalists interests that have shaped the system to its </p><p>service.  In the name of globalization, today proponents of </p><p>globalism attack economically, socially and politically </p><p>small nations or "peripheral nations" to take their </p><p>industries and natural resources using the excuse of "free </p><p>market." </p><p> </p><p>"In this context the rapine war against Iraq is a </p><p>manifestation of the most virulent aspect of globalization. </p><p>But it is also an aspect that has served more to unite </p><p>millions of women and men around the world against this war </p><p>of conquest.  Humanity has already said no to globalization; </p><p>today it has said no to the War.  Certainly, the new Hitler </p><p>could occupy Iraq and steal its oil, but he can\'t stop </p><p>history." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
