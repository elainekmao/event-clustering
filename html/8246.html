<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 003410 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: OPPOSITION FROM TURKEY\'S NSC SHARPENS CONFLICT </p><p>OVER EU-RELATED REFORM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2909 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 2998 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 1624 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 1636 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 1303 </p><p>     F. ANKARA 1423 </p><p>     G.

(C) Summary: GOT leaders continue to support passage of a </p><p>series of reform packages to harmonize Turkey\'s practices </p><p>with EU membership criteria.  TGS chief Ozkok and his deputy </p><p>Buyukanit also formally support Turkey\'s EU candidacy.  At </p><p>the same time the military-dominated National Security </p><p>Council (NSC) is striving to dilute the GOT\'s latest </p><p>EU-related reform package, which the NSC asserts could </p><p>undermine security.  The debate reflects the larger struggle </p><p>between the generally pro-reform elected civilian leadership, </p><p>and retrograde elements of the military and bureaucracy who </p><p>see human rights reform and EU membership as a threat to the </p><p>unity and "secular" nature of the State -- and above all to </p><p>their dominance over the Turkish State system.  As the </p><p>conflict sharpens, even our most cautious contacts are </p><p>beginning to openly discuss the sensitive issue of internal </p><p>resistance to reform.  The ruling AK party\'s handling of this </p><p>conflict will determine whether the GOT can satisfy Turkey </p><p>skeptics in the EU who question its ability to implement the </p><p>legislative reforms required for EU membership.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>NSC-GOT Tangle Over Package </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Public debate about the GOT\'s latest EU-related draft </p><p>reform package (reftel A) has intensified with press reports </p><p>of efforts by four-star NSC Secretary General Kilinc to have </p><p>key elements of the package withdrawn or revised.  Kilinc </p><p>reportedly sent a letter to GOT officials objecting to </p><p>proposed reforms that would: 1) abolish Article 8 of the </p><p>Anti-Terror Law; 2) allow foreign observers during Turkish </p><p>elections; and 3) allow Kurdish-language broadcasting on </p><p>private TV and radio stations.  Justice Minister Cicek and </p><p>ruling AK Party deputy chairman for policy Firat took the </p><p>rare step of publicly criticizing a senior military figure </p><p>and lambasted Kilinc; Cicek rejected Kilinc\'s argument that </p><p>the reforms would threaten security, while Firat asserted </p><p>that Kilinc "has no authority" to issue such warnings.  The </p><p>owner-CEO of a major media conglomerate put it more bluntly </p><p>in a private meeting with us: Kilinc, he observed, is </p><p>mounting an all-out effort to sabotage the package and the </p><p>wider reform effort, which most of the Turkish General Staff </p><p>(TGS) fears will eventually end its dominance over the </p><p>Turkish State and society.  In a May 21 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador, Cicek said the GOT would continue to support </p><p>Kurdish language reforms.  Differences over the package will </p><p>likely be debated at the May 28 NSC meeting before the </p><p>legislation is introduced in Parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Package Dispute Part of Larger Conflict </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The dispute over the new package reflects a broader </p><p>GOT conflict (ref A) between supporters and opponents of </p><p>human rights reform and EU membership.  EU membership has </p><p>long been championed by pro-reform diplomats serving in the </p><p>MFA Human Rights and EU departments as well as in the EU </p><p>Secretariat, a separate GOT agency established to support the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>EU membership drive.  Our contacts in these offices say they </p><p>have prepared extensive reform legislation designed to meet </p><p>all EU membership criteria.  They say they pull together </p><p>elements of these drafts to create reform packages when they </p><p>sense the political will to adopt certain reforms.  The </p><p>reform process got a boost when AK came to power in the </p><p>November 2002 elections and focused on EU membership as its </p><p>immediate priority.  Asligul Ugdul, EU Secretariat director </p><p>for political affairs, told us the two reform packages </p><p>adopted by Parliament in January comprised measures the </p><p>previous GOT was not willing to support.  At that time, Ugdul </p><p>and other EU-membership advocates were optimistic, figuring </p><p>AK would use its parliamentary majority to quickly advance </p><p>reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the face of support for EU-related reforms by AK\'s </p><p>leaders, and the formal support for EU candidacy by TGS chief </p><p>Ozkok and his deputy Buyukanit (whom we expect to deliver a </p><p>pro-EU membership speech at a TGS-sponsored globalization </p><p>conference the week of May 26 in Istanbul) hard-line elements </p><p>in the military, judiciary, and offices dealing with </p><p>religion, broadcasting, and education continue to try to </p><p>undermine the content and implementation of reform packages. </p><p>At the same time, opponents of EU-related reforms generally </p><p>keep a low profile, unwilling to openly oppose changes that </p><p>are overwhelmingly backed by the public.  As a staff advisor </p><p>to the parliamentary Human Rights Committee put it to us, </p><p>"When your enemy faces you, you can fight him, but it\'s </p><p>difficult to fight an enemy that pretends to be on your </p><p>side." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ersonmez Yarbay, an AK Party and Human Rights </p><p>Committee member, told us reform opponents are forced for </p><p>tactical reasons to feign rhetorical support for EU </p><p>membership because they have no foreign policy alternative to </p><p>put forward; Turkey is not economically strong enough to </p><p>stand on its own, and Turkey\'s southern and eastern neighbors </p><p>present no viable alternative to the EU.  Yarbay said many </p><p>reform opponents genuinely fear that fully meeting EU </p><p>membership criteria, particularly in areas such as religious </p><p>freedom and Kurdish cultural rights, will threaten the </p><p>foundations of the "secular", centralized Turkish State -- </p><p>and the stature of the institutions to which the reform </p><p>opponents belong.  Their strategy for the time being, he </p><p>said, is to buy time by insisting that the EU must accept </p><p>Turkey under special conditions, owing to Turkey\'s unique </p><p>geography and history.  Yarbay fears this "haggling" will </p><p>cause Turkey to miss the EU train.  If the GOT allows the </p><p>hard-liners to dictate its EU membership strategy, it will </p><p>repeat the mistake it made when it voted down the resolution </p><p>to allow U.S. troops to transit Turkey into northern Iraq, he </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Indeed, frustration over reform resistance has reached </p><p>the point where even our normally hyper-cautious MFA contacts </p><p>are beginning to discuss it openly -- MFA DDG for EU Affairs </p><p>Selim Yenel recently conceded that the Turkish bureaucracy </p><p>was one of the biggest obstacles to EU membership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Military, Kemalist Bureaucrats Fear Reform </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) And exactly who are the opponents of reform?  MPs, </p><p>human rights advocates across the spectrum, and the press </p><p>point to elements of the military as a major source of </p><p>opposition.  Our contacts attribute opposition among some </p><p>military officers to fear that EU membership criteria require </p><p>Turkey to reduce the military\'s political influence.  Our </p><p>contacts also blame Kemalists who hold key offices in the </p><p>bureaucracy, many of whom were appointed by the Nationalist </p><p>Movement Party (MHP) when it was in government.  Key among </p><p>these are public prosecutors, who, in the Turkish system, </p><p>have broad powers to indict "suspicious" individuals or </p><p>groups based on anything they deem "evidence."  Some </p><p>observers, like Human Rights Foundation President Yavuz Onen, </p><p>think AK itself is divided.  Onen told us he believes the </p><p>more Islamist wing of AK opposes reforms related to Kurdish </p><p>identity because it fears the rise of Kurdish politics as a </p><p>threat to Islamist politics. (Note: AK\'s ethnically Kurdish </p><p>Islamists as a rule are strong supporters of radical </p><p>pro-Kurdish reforms.  They, and the more Turkish nationalist </p><p>elements in AK, agree that by undercutting the military\'s </p><p>political power, the reform process is key to AK\'s survival </p><p>as a party -- and perhaps in government as well.  End note.) </p><p>Leading columnist and chief editor of center-left "Radikal" </p><p>Ismet Berkan has also reported that P.M. Erdogan has issued </p><p>instructions that the bureaucracy go slow on consideration of </p><p>property claims from minority religions (i.e., Christian and </p><p>Jewish foundations). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Opponents Gnawing Away at EU Candidacy </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The fall-out from Kilinc\'s latest salvo, and other </p><p>recent anti-reform steps enumerated below have undermined </p><p>Turkey\'s image in EU capitals: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- an Ankara State Security Court prosecutor May 6 led police </p><p>on another in a continuing series of fishing-expedition raids </p><p>of the Human Rights Association\'s Ankara offices (reftel B); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- contacts and the press continue to report that parents who </p><p>wish to give their children "unapproved" (i.e., Kurdish) </p><p>names are being thwarted (the new package would remove the </p><p>prohibition on such names); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkey\'s highest court announced the closure of the </p><p>pro-Kurdish HADEP party March 13, the same day a chief </p><p>prosecutor opened a case to close a sister party, DEHAP </p><p>(reftel C); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Jandarma officials prevented lawyers and relatives from </p><p>visiting jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan for 15 weeks </p><p>ending in March (reftels D-E); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- prosecutors in October 2002 indicted five German </p><p>pro-democracy foundations on spurious charges of separatism </p><p>and espionage (reftel F), although the case was finally </p><p>dismissed in March; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- although Parliament in August 2002 adopted legislative </p><p>reforms allowing Kurdish language broadcasts and courses, the </p><p>bureaucracy has drafted highly restrictive implementing </p><p>regulations preventing establishment of any such courses or </p><p>broadcasts (reftels G-H); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the Turkish Establishment continues to promote </p><p>inflexibility on Cyprus; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the pro-military "Cumhuriyet" daily, well-connected to </p><p>senior military, reported May 23 that TGS Chief Ozkok has </p><p>endorsed Kilinc\'s views, implying that he did so to counter </p><p>the increasingly intense public reporting and speculation on </p><p>divisions within the military leadership (ref I); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- "Cumhuriyet" also highlighted the growing discomfort of </p><p>younger officers with the AK Party and government -- a report </p><p>likely to resonate with Turks, who are familiar with the role </p><p>junior officers traditionally have played in prompting their </p><p>superiors to actively oppose civilian governments they find </p><p>troubling (ref I). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) As the government seeks to meet EU membership </p><p>criteria, human rights reforms begin to cut closer to the </p><p>foundations of the Kemalist State.  We are thus seeing </p><p>heightened attempts to blunt and undermine reforms led by </p><p>reactionaries in the armed forces, the bureaucracy and other </p><p>bastions of Establishment propriety.  For Turkey\'s critics in </p><p>the EU, failure by AK\'s leaders to gain control of the reform </p><p>process will provide fresh evidence of the GOT\'s inability to </p><p>fully implement the reforms necessary for EU membership. </p><p>P.M. Erdogan, FonMin Gul and others in ruling AK party are </p><p>mindful of this danger to Turkey\'s candidacy from continued </p><p>Establishment resistance and appear committed to persevere in </p><p>their reform efforts, but their task is a difficult, </p><p>step-by-step one. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
