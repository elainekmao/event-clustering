<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002363 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY APRIL 11:  INTEREST RATES REMAIN </p><p>HIGH </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Flat, Lack of Confidence Looking Forward </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) At mid-day April 11, Turkish markets were quiet.  FM </p><p>Gul\'s April 10 statements that U.S. forces would prevent a </p><p>(Kurdish) fait d\'accompli calmed market fears of a Turkish </p><p>military intervention.  However, T-bill yields at week\'s end </p><p>remain above the April 8 auction levels, meaning the Turkish </p><p>banks who bought in the auction have lost money.  Market </p><p>sentiment remains generally gloomy as described below. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The April 28, 2004 bond is trading at 64.5 percent </p><p>compounded; the lira is flat at TL 1,650,000; the Istanbul </p><p>Stock Exchange is 0.03 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Interest rates on government securities aren\'t </p><p>coming down  partly because they reflect a higher than usual </p><p>risk of debt default, according to market contacts like OYAK </p><p>Holding Exec VP Ergun Okur.  (He does expect some decrease in </p><p>rates as northern Iraq fears subside, but only to the </p><p>mid-50\'s.)  Concerns about an eventual "debt event" also </p><p>affect companies\' investment decisions, he added.  Turkish </p><p>companies are staying liquid, making money from the high </p><p>interest rates rather than investing.  OYAK (Turkey\'s second </p><p>largest car manufacturer) reports exports are also down </p><p>slightly from last year because of weak conditions in their </p><p>main European markets.  He and others here expect low growth </p><p>this year, 1-2 percent rather than the GOT\'s 5 percent growth </p><p>target. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Lack of foreign inflows into Turkish markets is a </p><p>problem for  Bender Securities, a local stock brokerage half </p><p>owned by Deutsche Bank and with Turkey\'s largest foreign </p><p>equity client base.   Bender analyst Golkan returned from a </p><p>"depressing" road show in Europe.  He told us that long-time </p><p>Turkey investors are staying out, and have no trust in AK\'s </p><p>ability to turn around the negative sentiment.  Golkan said </p><p>the GOT\'s recent personnel changes just further damage </p><p>credibility.  On the high roll-over rates in the April 9 </p><p>auctions, Golkan said this isn\'t a sign of Turkish bank </p><p>confidence; instead it\'s a sign that Treasury needs the cash </p><p>now.  Otherwise, he asked, why would Treasury lock in this </p><p>amount of debt at the current high rates?   From the London </p><p>investment bank perspective, Citigroup emerging markets </p><p>analyst Wyman said the only foreigners in Turkish lira </p><p>investments are now in purely for the moral hazard based on </p><p>prospects of U.S. aid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Central Bank released the results of its early </p><p>April survey of inflationary expectations on April 10. </p><p>Increases in the consumer price index, looking 12 months into </p><p>the future, averaged 28.3 percent in early April (compared </p><p>with the GOT year-end target of 20 percent).  In early March, </p><p>CPI expectations averaged 26.2 percent. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
