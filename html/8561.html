<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 002715 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/04/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UAE FIRST LADY SPEARHEADS CAMPAIGN TO CLEAN </p><p>         UP THE MOSQUES, LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  UAE First Lady Shaykha Fatima Bint </p><p>Mubarak briefed the Ambassador on her personally- </p><p>designed campaign to literally and figuratively clean </p><p>up the UAE\'s many mosques.  With her customary </p><p>extraordinary attention to detail, Fatima has arranged </p><p>everything from the provision of refrigerators to the </p><p>need to lock the mosques after the day\'s last prayers </p><p>so as to keep troublemakers from spending the night </p><p>and turning mosques into their safehavens.  The </p><p>campaign, which includes the participation of Al-Azhar </p><p>notables, also features evening lessons at mosques, </p><p>Quran memorization courses and the establishment of a </p><p>one-year training course on oratory skills for imams. </p><p>Since the wrenching events of 9/11, Fatima has taken a </p><p>personal interest in the negative influence of </p><p>fundamentalism in the UAE.  She has worked closely </p><p>with her sons, particularly State Security Director </p><p>Hazza, to monitor the country\'s mosques, schools and </p><p>judicial system.  In so doing, she has earned herself </p><p>some internal enemies and told the Ambassador she has </p><p>been the target of at least one smear campaign in an </p><p>Arabic-language paper published in the U.S.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO GODLINESS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On 5/30, the UAEG launched a week-long mosque </p><p>construction/renovation and religious education </p><p>campaign throughout the country\'s seven emirates.  The </p><p>campaign, titled "Construction of Houses of God </p><p>Symbolizes Faith and Civilization," was spearheaded by </p><p>UAE First Lady Shaykha Fatima Bint Mubarak, wife of </p><p>President Zayid.  In a 6/3 private meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador Shaykha Fatima shared that the campaign had </p><p>been her personal initiative, i.e. not instigated by </p><p>one of her six sons, aka the Bani Fatima -- Chief of </p><p>Staff Muhammad, MFA Minstate Hamdan, State Security </p><p>Director Hazza, Presidential Court Director Mansour, </p><p>Infomin Abdullah or Zayid\'s Private Department Head </p><p>Tahnoun, who represent a formidable decision-making </p><p>clique. </p><p> </p><p>4. (c) The UAE First Lady spoke with evident pride </p><p>about the campaign\'s success, noting it was designed </p><p>to improve "performance" at the mosques and included </p><p>the participation of four imams from Cairo\'s </p><p>prestigious Al-Azhar University.  Fatima wanted the </p><p>campaign to emphasize the need for cleanliness and </p><p>security in the UAE\'s houses of Muslim worship.  For </p><p>instance, she ordered the installation of refrigerated </p><p>units at each mosque to provide cold water and </p><p>instructed that the areas for washing before prayers </p><p>be kept clean and the mosques be closed and locked </p><p>after the last evening prayer until the next morning\'s </p><p>prayer to ensure that no "trouble makers" camp out. </p><p>Fatima noted to the Ambassador that undesirables had </p><p>made a habit of spending the night at mosques and </p><p>turning them into safehavens.  Fatima told the </p><p>Ambassador that her next goal is to clean up the </p><p>municipalities; for instance, she wants to replace </p><p>open garbage cannisters -- which pose a health and </p><p>security hazard (as people can place dangerous </p><p>objects, i.e. explosives) into them -- with closed </p><p>bins. </p><p> </p><p>HELPING MUSLIMS BETTER UNDERSTAND ISLAM A KEY GOAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) According to local press reports, the campaign </p><p>will include the construction and renovation of </p><p>mosques and an "activation" of their role in society </p><p>through religious education.  The UAEG opened two bank </p><p>accounts to receive donations in support of mosque </p><p>construction and renovation.  The religious education </p><p>campaign will be carried out through Friday sermons, </p><p>evening lessons at mosques, Islamic lectures and </p><p>seminars aimed at helping Muslims better understand </p><p>Islam, new Holy Quran memorization courses at 350 </p><p>Islamic centers, and the distribution of more than </p><p>40,000 copies of the Holy Quran.  The Ras Al Khaimah </p><p>Department of Islamic Affairs and Awqaf also announced </p><p>a one-year training course on oratory skills for 166 </p><p>imams to help increase their knowledge of Islam. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  FATIMA\'S INFLUENCE FAR REACHING </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Fatima has been a key behind-the-scenes player </p><p>in UAE decision-making circles, particularly since the </p><p>wrenching events of 9/11 and the shattering revelation </p><p>that two Emiratis were among the 19 hijackers.  She </p><p>was among the first UAE leaders to emphasize the need </p><p>to assess the impact of extremist thought on UAE </p><p>society.  Fatima carefully tracked the leadership\'s </p><p>appraisal of the fundamentalist threat, guiding her </p><p>son Hazza to look at the country\'s mosques and </p><p>education and judicial systems.  She used her personal </p><p>relationships with the northern emirates\' rulers and </p><p>their wives to obtain their buy-in of Hazza\'s actions </p><p>in their territories.  The results have included the </p><p>unprecedented sidelining of at least 150 individuals, </p><p>all of them Emiratis, who were deemed to have </p><p>fundamentalist tendencies.  Fatima\'s latest campaign </p><p>is very much in keeping with the UAEG\'s decision to </p><p>maintain tight control over the country\'s 500 mosques. </p><p>This means that no detail is left unaddressed by the </p><p>First Lady -- from the temperature of the water served </p><p>to parishioner to the contents of books distributed as </p><p>part of religious education. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
