<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002295 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPDC, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: LETTER TO PRESIDENT BUSH FROM MDC LEADER TSVANGIRAI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  On October 16, Embassy was asked to convey a letter </p><p>from Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai to President Bush and other current and former </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>USG officials seeking a more active UN role in addressing </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s crises.  We have pouched the letters to AF/S and </p><p>convey the text of the Tsvangirai-Bush letter in paragraph </p><p>2 below.   The other letters contain identical text and </p><p>were delivered in sealed envelopes addressed to former </p><p>President Clinton; former President Carter; UN Ambassador </p><p>Negroponte; Representatives Ed Royce and Donald Payne; </p><p>Senators Daschle and Lott; Reverend Jesse Jackson; and </p><p>Chester Crocker. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Begin text of Tsvangirai-Bush letter: </p><p> </p><p>Mr. George W. Bush </p><p>President of the United States of America </p><p>Washington DC </p><p> </p><p>October 14, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. President, </p><p> </p><p>Re:  Call for UN Security Council action on Crimes Against </p><p>Humanity Committed by the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>On behalf of the majority of the people of Zimbabwe, I </p><p>write to you Sir, and the other Five Permanent Members of </p><p>the United Nations Security Council. </p><p> </p><p>Since February 2000, several efforts by the United States </p><p>of America, the European Union, the Commonwealth, SADC, the </p><p>World Council of Churches and several local and </p><p>international civic organizations appealed to Robert Mugabe </p><p>to uphold the rule of law, respect human rights and put a </p><p>stop to political murders, rape, torture and state- </p><p>sponsored terror and violence, but the illegitimate Mugabe </p><p>regime has not relented.  Instead, it has demonstrated </p><p>utter contempt of international opinion and has reaffirmed </p><p>its commitment to carrying out crimes against humanity as a </p><p>means of subjugating the people of Zimbabwe and denying </p><p>them the right to freely determine their own destiny. </p><p> </p><p>There is growing evidence on the ground in Zimbabwe today </p><p>Sir, that the subjugated and brutalized majority are </p><p>preparing to react violently against this state of affairs. </p><p>The consequent bloody civil strife will not only result in </p><p>a massive loss of life but will inevitably spill into the </p><p>territory of the neighboring states of the region.  The </p><p>international community must not allow Mugabe to continue </p><p>charting this path towards national destruction and </p><p>darkness. </p><p> </p><p>It is in the context of this grim and extremely dangerous </p><p>situation that the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), </p><p>which represents the legitimate aspirations of the people </p><p>of Zimbabwe, calls for the intervention of the UN Security </p><p>Council in the Zimbabwe crisis in accordance with Article </p><p>39 (Chapter VII powers) of the United Nations Charter. </p><p>Crimes that rival fascism and Nazism in scale and </p><p>wickedness are being committed daily, not by an occupying </p><p>force, but by a supposedly sovereign government of the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>We therefore call for the urgent institution of an </p><p>international program for Zimbabwe under the auspices of </p><p>the United Nations, designed to: </p><p> </p><p>1.  Investigate the gross human rights abuses and </p><p>crimes against humanity that are being perpetrated by </p><p>the Mugabe regime. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Investigate state-sponsored violence and the breakdown </p><p>of the rule of law. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Investigate the denial of food relief to suspected </p><p>political opponents and the consequent mass starvation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Facilitate the realization of a free, unfettered and </p><p>fair expression of the popular will of the people of </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>We ask and plead with you Sir, and your fellow permanent </p><p>members of the UN Security Council, to place these issues </p><p>on the agenda of the Security Council for serious </p><p>discussion and speedy resolution.  In our humble view, </p><p>there remains no other viable alternative in the quest to </p><p>put a stop to the crimes against humanity that are being </p><p>perpetrated daily by the Mugabe regime. </p><p> </p><p>The Mugabe regime has recreated the conditions of the </p><p>Rhodesian crisis in 1965, when the Ian Smith regime </p><p>effected a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) and </p><p>established an illegitimate government in order to maintain </p><p>a racial political order over the majority of the </p><p>population. </p><p> </p><p>UDI sought to deny the majority of the people of the then </p><p>Rhodesia the right of self-determination.  In 1966, in </p><p>reaction to that development, the UN Security Council (SC </p><p>Res.232 (1966) and subsequent resolutions), acted swiftly </p><p>to confront an ominous development that threatened regional </p><p>and international peace and security. </p><p> </p><p>In reacting to UDI, the UN Security Council recognized the </p><p>legitimacy of the Zimbabwe people\'s struggle against racist </p><p>minority rule, which was undemocratic.  Similarly, the </p><p>Security Council must legitimately consider Robert Mugabe\'s </p><p>forestalling of the installation of a legitimate elected </p><p>government through illegitimate force, and the consequent </p><p>violations of human rights, as clearly constituting a </p><p>threat to international peace and security. </p><p> </p><p>Through his brutal suppression of the right of the </p><p>Zimbabwean people to freely elect a government of their </p><p>choice and through his regime\'s perpetration of crimes </p><p>against humanity, Robert Mugabe has crated an explosive and </p><p>dangerous situation akin to Ian Smith\'s UDI.  A corrupt, </p><p>murderous and illegitimate regime maintains state sponsored </p><p>violence against a defenseless civilian population.  This </p><p>situation is rapidly degenerating into mass killings, </p><p>refugee flows and mass starvation. </p><p> </p><p>The prevailing internal situation therefore constitutes a </p><p>threat to regional and international peace and security. </p><p>SADC Heads of State and government came to the same </p><p>conclusion at their Luanda, Angola Summit when they denied </p><p>the Mugabe regime the opportunity to host the SADC 2003 </p><p>Summit.  We believe that the international community must </p><p>proceed rapidly to use this SADC position as a launching </p><p>pad for determined action to clamp down on the growing </p><p>spiral of violence and crimes against humanity perpetrated </p><p>by the Mugabe regime. </p><p> </p><p>In his violent seizure of power, Robert Mugabe must not be </p><p>allowed to invoke the international legal term, "national </p><p>sovereignty" in a vain endeavor to reinforce his </p><p>illegitimate political position internationally.  He is </p><p>susceptible to a megalomania that identifies his corporeal </p><p>self with symbols of nation and state.  This provides the </p><p>context in which Robert Mugabe inflicts crimes against </p><p>humanity upon those Zimbabweans trapped within the </p><p>boundaries of the territory that he confuses with himself. </p><p>In Robert Mugabe\'s case, the term "national sovereignty" </p><p>must not be used to allow him to shield the suppression of </p><p>the real popular sovereignty from external rebuke and </p><p>sanction. </p><p> </p><p>The sovereignty of the people of Zimbabwe must be </p><p>protected, but the object of the protection is not the </p><p>power base of a tyrant who rules directly by naked and </p><p>illegitimate force or through the apparatus of a </p><p>totalitarian political order.  Instead, what must be </p><p>protected is the capacity of the people of Zimbabwe to </p><p>freely express and effect legitimate choices about the </p><p>identities and policies of those who govern them. </p><p> </p><p>The time for the Security Council to act is now.  Delay </p><p>will result in a costly catastrophe in terms of human </p><p>lives. </p><p> </p><p>We therefore urgently appeal to you, Mr. President, as one </p><p>of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, </p><p>to act with your characteristic determination to put a stop </p><p>to the violent abuse of human rights and the carnage that </p><p>is going on and assist in the process of laying a healing </p><p>hand on the country and its tortured people. </p><p> </p><p>I avail myself, Mr. President, this opportunity to renew </p><p>the assurances of my highest consideration. </p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai, </p><p>President, Movement for Democratic Change. </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Comment:  Tsvangirai\'s urgent appeal to the United </p><p>Nations reflects the growing pressure the opposition party </p><p>is under from the GOZ, the MDC\'s inability to devise </p><p>effective, home-grown solutions to Zimbabwe\'s intensifying </p><p>cycle of crises, and a genuine concern that the situation </p><p>here will soon degenerate into civil conflict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
