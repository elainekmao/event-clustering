<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003964 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NICOSIA FOR DEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, XF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MIDEAST STATES DISCUSS REGIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING; </p><p>STRESS ENHANCED COOPERATION, INFORMATION SHARING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U)   The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,s </p><p>Subcommission on Illicit Drug Traffic and Related Matters in </p><p>the Near and Middle East met in Amman, Jordan, 23-27 June </p><p>2003.  The functions of the Subcommission are to coordinate </p><p>regional activities directed against illicit drug traffic and </p><p>to formulate recommendations to the Commission on Narcotic </p><p>Drugs.  It meets annually for a period of four days and </p><p>strives to strengthen the bonds of cooperation between member </p><p>states in combating the drug trafficking and addiction. </p><p>Embassy Amman Pol Intern attended with two representatives of </p><p>the DEA from Nicosia, Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U)   Participants collectively highlighted three areas </p><p>of interest in the opening sessions of the conference: </p><p>combating the drug trade through high-level contact and </p><p>cooperation; breaking the heroin market by assisting </p><p>Afghanistan in setting up a legal, institutional framework to </p><p>retard outflow by 2013; and, providing Afghanistan with the </p><p>political, security, and financial assistance necessary to </p><p>rid that country of its sizable poppy crop. Members present </p><p>included Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Iran, UAE, </p><p>Lebanon, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Turkey, India, the United </p><p>States, Russia, and Germany.  The Arab League, United Nations </p><p>Development Program, Saudi Arabia,s Prince Nayef Academy for </p><p>Security Sciences, and the World Customs Organization were </p><p>among the intergovernmental and United Nations bodies in </p><p>attendance. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU)   Although speakers in the first sessions spoke at </p><p>length about the importance of intergovernmental cooperation, </p><p>it was clear from their remarks that little, in fact, </p><p>existed.  Instead, participants lauded the efforts of </p><p>individual states in intercepting large quantities of drugs </p><p>within and at their borders.  Given that most experts agree </p><p>that the Middle East is a critical transit zone between </p><p>suppliers in Central, South, and South-East Asia and areas of </p><p>consumption in Europe and North America, participants devoted </p><p>considerable attention to developing joint investigations, </p><p>law enforcement training, and information sharing. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU)   The Subcommission established ad-hoc working </p><p>groups to review issues of regional importance and to </p><p>facilitate informal discussions. These sessions provided </p><p>participants with a forum in which to praise one another (and </p><p>themselves) for individual state achievements while </p><p>paradoxically making veiled criticisms of one another for not </p><p>doing enough to prevent outflow from their borders.  In </p><p>particular, India and Pakistan, and Pakistan and the United </p><p>Arab Emirates, traded barbs regarding porous borders and the </p><p>ability of precursors and final products to slip past </p><p>officials. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU)   Veiled criticism of Afghanistan dominated most </p><p>sessions, despite the absence of Afghan representatives at </p><p>the conference.  Afghanistan remains the world,s largest </p><p>producer of opium, with an estimated 85 thousand hectares of </p><p>cultivation this year.  At the same time, the country today </p><p>maintains no industries that require the precursor chemicals </p><p>necessary to produce final products for export, suggesting </p><p>that the inflow of such products into Afghanistan only </p><p>furthers the production of opium and opium derivatives. </p><p>Participants called for bilateral and multilateral approaches </p><p>to eradicate this year,s poppy crop; involving </p><p>non-governmental organizations in the process; and, </p><p>encouraging greater research on drug abuse prevention. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (U)   The Subcommission called for the dismantling of </p><p>regional clandestine laboratories, targeting new trafficking </p><p>routes, and discussing the latest means of smuggling final </p><p>products and precursors (including container traffic).  In </p><p>spite of pledges of assistance, experts warned that </p><p>Afghanistan would not have the capability to deter </p><p>trafficking significantly for years. Instead, the meeting </p><p>suggested that the regional and international focus for </p><p>Afghanistan should be on drug storage, cross-contamination, </p><p>and preserving chain of evidence at Afghan police stations. </p><p>Participants in plenary and working group sessions agreed on </p><p>the need to adopt regional control mechanisms; maintain lines </p><p>of communication between offices; establish regular meetings </p><p>for operational heads; create a regional database to track </p><p>offenders and routes; and, adopt container profiling </p><p>strategies currently in place in advanced industrialized </p><p>ports. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (SBU)   COMMENT:  Given the level of generality of the </p><p>discussions at the conference and the clear reliance of the </p><p>participant nations on unilateral control and enforcement </p><p>measures, we doubt that much concrete progress will come from </p><p>the conference.  We defer to DEA Nicosia on the desirability </p><p>and viability of the specific recommendations from the </p><p>conference </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
