Post believes that this proposed </p><p>Volvis program would provide him with a wide exposure </p><p>to U.S. government and its policies especially in </p><p>defense, national security, foreign policy, and anti- </p><p>terrorism.  This will result in multiplier effect as he </p><p>will use the newly acquired knowledge in his widely </p><p>read column.
