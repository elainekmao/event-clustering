<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002596 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: FORMER PRESIDENT DEMIREL TELLS AMBASSADOR </p><p>TURKEY MUST MEND FENCES WITH U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2521 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. R. Pearson.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In an April 21 meeting with Ambassador, </p><p>former President Suleyman Demirel offered his thinking on the </p><p>way ahead in U.S.-Turkey relations.  Demirel volunteered that </p><p>there is a debate in Ankara power centers about Turkey\'s </p><p>strategic orientation; but that in his view, "the Turkish </p><p>Army cannot make war on the Kurds or the people of northern </p><p>Iraq."  Turkey, he stated, has no alternative but to repair </p><p>ties to the U.S.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Demirel observed that Turkey would have been better </p><p>served had the GOT been up front with the United States from </p><p>the beginning on Iraq: "90% of the public was against the </p><p>war.  They (GOT) should have told you that they simply could </p><p>not open a northern front, but would support you in other </p><p>ways.  Then they wouldn\'t have had to push the (failed) March </p><p>1 motion in Parliament."  In Demirel\'s view, the result was a </p><p>textbook case of "mismanagement, not \'democracy\'" in action. </p><p>He suggested that Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc, who </p><p>opposed the resolution, was among the few who understood </p><p>clearly what he was trying to do; before the vote, Arinc </p><p>declined to read aloud the rules about how votes would be </p><p>counted (in this case, that abstentions could mean -- as they </p><p>did -- the failure of the government to obtain the necessary </p><p>absolute majority). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Demirel also observed that media critics in the United </p><p>States had started to criticize "Turkey," vice simply the </p><p>government -- which risked fomenting "anti-Americanism" in </p><p>the Turkish press and elsewhere.  While it would be natural </p><p>for Turkish media to try to rebut such charges, Demirel </p><p>expressed concern lest it get out of hand.  "People will </p><p>rally to defend Turkey.  I\'m worried about provocations" in </p><p>the Turkish press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) "Coming to the military," Demirel stated, "I don\'t </p><p>know how or why" the military did not push to support the </p><p>March 1 resolution.  "How come the Pentagon didn\'t work on </p><p>them?"  Ambassador replied that USG/DoD had had continuing </p><p>and detailed negotiations and consultations with military </p><p>leaders on all aspects of the Iraq operation, including </p><p>Turkey\'s potential role in it.  However, the USG sense is </p><p>that the Turkish military is highly suspicious of USG </p><p>intentions in northern Iraq, despite: (1) the fact that the </p><p>U.S. is fully in control in the north and throughout Iraq; </p><p>and (2) our repeated assertions on the need to maintain </p><p>Iraq\'s territorial integrity and opposition to the emergence </p><p>of an independent Kurdish state.  Demirel noted that Turkey </p><p>is "sensitive" on the Kurdish question and regards it as a </p><p>"casus belli."  He expressed strong confidence that the USG </p><p>would live up to its commitments in this regard, but added, </p><p>"I understand that you have to do something for the Kurds -- </p><p>they helped you."  Demirel suggested that a federal state in </p><p>n. Iraq would be reasonable so long as it had a regional vice </p><p>ethnic name (i.e., no "Kurdish"/"Kurdistan").  To Demirel, </p><p>the bottom line is that there is and will be a power vacuum </p><p>in Iraq that only the USG can fill; the U.N. he said, would </p><p>only make a hash out of the situation, as would the Iraqis, </p><p>at least initially. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Demirel also raised concerns about problems associated </p><p>with delays in the Baku-Ceyhan-Tbilisi pipeline and rumors of </p><p>its possible "postponement," which he said, would promote an </p><p>additional measure of "anti-American sentiment" in both </p><p>Turkey and Azerbaijan.  Ambassador offered assurances that </p><p>the USG continued strongly to support the project.  He noted </p><p>that the problems, such as they are, revolve around BOTAS\' </p><p>management, which had led to a two-month delay in the </p><p>construction schedule.  BOTAS needed to get back on the </p><p>timetable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Whither Turkey </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador stated that the U.S. is watching Turkey to </p><p>determine where it is heading now that the Iraq war is over </p><p>and there are new realities on the ground.  From the USG </p><p>perspective, it is important to rebuild bilateral trust. </p><p>Demirel intimated that there is a debate underway in Ankara </p><p>now.  "Where should Turkey go -- with Iran, Syria, Egypt, </p><p>Russia?"  In his view, "Turkey\'s interests in development </p><p>dictate that we side with the West, the U.S. and the EU.  We </p><p>have no other alternative."  Returning to Turkish military </p><p>suspicions of the U.S., Demirel said that "soldiers should </p><p>talk to soldiers."  Though the military worries about the </p><p>PKK/KADEK presence on both sides of the Turkish-Iraqi border, </p><p>"the Turkish Army cannot make war on the Kurds or the people </p><p>of northern Iraq."  The USG must adhere to President Bush\'s </p><p>commitment to combat terrorism.  Ambassador replied that the </p><p>USG is committed to ensuring that Iraq will no longer serve </p><p>as a haven for any terrorist groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Demirel\'s influence with the civilian political class </p><p>is waning -- he has so far been unable to shake the </p><p>right-of-center DYP, his political baby, out of the </p><p>increasingly deep torpor into which DYP leader Agar appears </p><p>to be dragging it.  He does, however, have the ear of the </p><p>Turkish State; there is no politician to whom the military </p><p>will more readily listen than the conciliatory ex-President </p><p>-- though as reftel suggests, perhaps fewer and fewer </p><p>ultimately share his views on U.S.-Turkish relations. </p><p>(Moreover, it is unclear how much influence he has with </p><p>Sezer, whose performance in the run-up to the war suggests he </p><p>takes little guidance from his predecessor.) </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
