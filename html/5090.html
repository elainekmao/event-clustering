Anthony Wayne </p><p>Assistant Secretary </p><p>U.S. Department of State </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear Colleague, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With  reference  to your letter of 18th December  2002,  I </p><p>would  also  like  to  thank you  for  your  valuable  and </p><p>constructive contribution to our discussion concerning the </p><p>OECD reform in ECSS Meeting on 13-14 November 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We  share your concerns about how to make best use of  the </p><p>OECD\'s limited resources. We also believe that there is  a </p><p>certain need for reassessment of the OECD\'s priorities and </p><p>its work programme. Needless to say, this process requires </p><p>a  frank discussion among the members. Only after  such  a </p><p>discussion, we can achieve consensus on the new priorities </p><p>of  the  Organization  in  the  new  millennium.  Such   a </p><p>discussion should involve the input from relevant agencies </p><p>in the capitals as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I  would like to inform you that we have already initiated </p><p>a   comprehensive  study  on  this  issue,  involving  our </p><p>relevant  agencies.  We  have  already  received   initial </p><p>responses and we aim at finalising them in a short time in </p><p>order to make our contribution to the work of the Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At  this stage, to summarize our initial comments  on  the </p><p>issue, I can list our priorities as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Core issues: </p><p>Promotion of economic growth, </p><p>Financial stability and structural adjustment, </p><p>Contribution to shaping globalisation for the  benefit  of </p><p>all through the expansion of trade and investment, </p><p>Enhancement of public and private sector governance </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Issues of secondary importance: </p><p>Provision of employment opportunities, </p><p>Improvement of human capital and social cohesion, </p><p>Promotion of sustainable environment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Of  course, we will present our more detailed opinions  on </p><p>identification of the sub items of these objectives in due </p><p>course. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear Colleague, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Regarding  the  Anti-Bribery Convention, it  is  my  great </p><p>pleasure  to inform you that the enforcement law  of  this </p><p>Convention  was  adopted by the Turkish  Parliament  on  2 </p><p>January 2003 and entered into force on 11 January 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For  us,  this issue remains to be important  and  we  are </p><p>ready  to  support the follow-up activities for successful </p><p>implementation of this Convention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It  is  also  my  sincere  hope to achieve  some  concrete </p><p>results  on  these  two  issues, namely  OECD  reform  and </p><p>implementation of Anti-Bribery Convention. For  our  part, </p><p>we  will  do  our  best  to make our contribution  to  the </p><p>deliberations of next ECSS meeting. I am always  ready  to </p><p>provide  any  assistance  that you  may  need  during  the </p><p>preparations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Alev Kilic, Ambassador </p><p>Deputy Under-Secretary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text MFA letter. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
