<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 001558 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: DING DONG NE WIN IS DEAD.....FINALLY! </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 1555 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  The regime confirmed ex-dictator Ne Win\'s death with </p><p>a brief obituary from the family buried on the second to the </p><p>last page of today\'s State-controlled newspapers.  Tucked </p><p>between the weather forecast and television schedule, the </p><p>obituary was a brief statement that Ne Win died at 7:30 in </p><p>the morning on December 5th and, based on his wishes, was </p><p>cremated at a private cemetery in Rangoon at 1:30 that </p><p>afternoon. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  There is no indication that the SPDC is planning any </p><p>state ceremonies or official recognition of Ne Win\'s death, </p><p>despite the fact that he ruled the country for almost three </p><p>decades.  The MOFA Americas\' Division Director told Poloff he </p><p>was not aware of any government plans to honor Ne Win, saying </p><p>he only knew what he had read in the obituary.  With the </p><p>general public\'s attitude toward the death ranging from </p><p>relief to satisfaction, the regime may be assessing the </p><p>appropriate official response.  The Buddhist custom is for </p><p>friends, neighbors and the public to visit the home of the </p><p>deceased on the seventh day after the death to offer </p><p>condolences to the family and donations to the monks who have </p><p>prayed to help his soul into another life.  This gives the </p><p>regime some time to decide what, if anything, it will do to </p><p>recognize Ne Win\'s demise. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Word of Ne Win\'s death did not spread as quickly as </p><p>expected through the streets.  By late evening on December 5, </p><p>a sampling of the general public indicated that few had heard </p><p>that he was dead.  When they heard the news, the most common </p><p>response was "finally." </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
