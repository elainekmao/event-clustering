<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008448 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S NEW GOVERNMENT: MORE INSIGHTS INTO </p><p>CABINET FORMATION AND SPEAKERSHIP OF PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8382 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by polcounselor John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: President Sezer drew a line by rejecting one </p><p>proposed cabinet assignment in the AK government, but allowed </p><p>AK to keep the candidate as a State Minister.  Fiery orator </p><p>Bulent Arinc, who has his own strong following among AK </p><p>voters and whom we expect to underscore the prerogatives of </p><p>Parliament, has been elected Speaker.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) We understand that, in considering AK Party\'s draft </p><p>cabinet list (ref), President Sezer objected to inclusion of </p><p>Besir Atalay as Education Minister.  He did so owing to </p><p>Atalay\'s having been fired from his rectorship of Kirikkale </p><p>University in the wake of the 1997 "February 28" process </p><p>("post-modern" coup) through which the Turkish military </p><p>organized the downfall of the Islamist Refah-Yol government </p><p>of Necmettin Erbakan.  The High Education Council (YOK) ruled </p><p>that Atalay had hired fundamentalist teachers and given </p><p>scholarships to Islamist students; then President Demirel </p><p>approved the YOK decision.  AK, i.e., P.M.-designate Abdullah </p><p>Gul, insisted on keeping Atalay as a State Minister, gave </p><p>former leading ANAP figure and AK newcomer Erkan Mumcu (ref </p><p>A) the education portfolio, withdrew the name of Vahit Erdem </p><p>as candidate DefMin, and gave the defense portfolio to Vecdi </p><p>Gonul (ref). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As expected, Nov. 19 AK vice chairman Bulent Arinc was </p><p>elected Speaker of Parliament on the first ballot over CHP </p><p>candidate Onder Sav by 369 to 173 votes.  Arinc, who has a </p><p>strong following among more militant AK supporters, forced </p><p>his way into the position over the plan of party chairman </p><p>Erdogan to promote Vecdi Gonul, trusted by President Sezer, </p><p>for the position which is second in Turkish state protocolary </p><p>order (the Speaker is acting President in President\'s </p><p>absence). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Arinc, one of the best orators in Parliament, has thus </p><p>carved out an independent spot for himself, since the Speaker </p><p>is separate from the cabinet and not answerable to the </p><p>President (when the rumors started spreading that Sezer was </p><p>angling to have AK nominate Gonul as Speaker, Arinc </p><p>emphasized to us that Sezer had no right to meddle in the </p><p>selection process).  We will watch the Erdogan-Gul-Arinc </p><p>dynamics and the Arinc-Sezer dynamics closely.  At a minimum </p><p>we can expect Arinc to be more willing to assert the </p><p>prerogatives of the elected Parliament and defend them in the </p><p>face of a limited-power presidency and other elements of the </p><p>Kemalist Deep State.  Arinc bio in para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Bulent Arinc: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Born in Bursa 1948.  Graduated from Ankara U. Law Faculty </p><p>1970.  Worked as a lawyer in the Aegean region city of </p><p>Manisa.  From his university days was active in Necmettin </p><p>Erbakan\'s Islamist National Salvation Party (MSP) youth </p><p>branch directorate, and served as Manisa province chairman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--1995 elected on Erbakan\'s Refah Party ticket from Manisa </p><p>and served in the Refah Party directorate.  He served on the </p><p>parliamentary Judiciary Committee and Turkey-EU Joint </p><p>Commission.  Elected in 1999 from Manisa on the </p><p>Refah-successor Fazilet ticket, Arinc served as a Fazilet </p><p>parliamentary group deputy chairman and served on the Foreign </p><p>Affairs Committee.  Joining the newly-formed AK upon the </p><p>closure of Fazilet, he was elected AK\'s parliamentary group </p><p>chairman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Married, two children.  Reads Arabic; studied some English. </p><p> Devoutly religious Muslim who brings a neo-Ottoman </p><p>sensibility to politics and to foreign policy considerations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Arinc has built up a strong following among Islam-oriented </p><p>voters partly through years of crisscrossing Turkey as a </p><p>lecturer and symposium participant; through his rhetorical </p><p>skills as an incisive debater on TV talk shows; and through </p><p>his willingness more than others in the Islam-oriented </p><p>movement to call the Turkish military (and Sezer) to task for </p><p>meddling in political affairs.  He has visited Western Europe </p><p>frequently, and has been to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Arinc is a long-time. close contact of the Embassy.  Since </p><p>the death of his son in an auto accident in the late 1990\'s </p><p>and particularly since the formation of AK in mid-2001, we </p><p>have found him to be more attuned to issues of protocol, </p><p>given the attention paid to Erdogan and Gul and his own </p><p>sensitivity at being considered AK\'s number three man.  At </p><p>the same time he has always been an open interlocutor, </p><p>particularly in more casual settings, where matters of </p><p>protocol do not figure prominently.  He enjoys contact with </p><p>the Embassy.  He is a tough politician, committed to his </p><p>Islam-oriented principles, fiery as an orator but measured in </p><p>private conversation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
