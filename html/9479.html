<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004498 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PM (DAS MAGGI) AND EUR/SE </p><p>SAF/IA FOR W. MITCHELL AND MAJ GEN GRATION </p><p>DSCA FOR LT. GEN. WALTERS AND LT COL BUCHHOLZ </p><p>DTSA FOR S. SEVIER </p><p>OSD FOR DUSD LISA BRONSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TU, MASS </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ARMED FORCES AGREE TO MOVE FORWARD ON </p><p>SPEWS II SALE </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION ROBERT DEUTSCH. </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: THE TURKISH ARMED FORCES HAVE ELECTED TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD WITH THE PROCUREMENT OF THE SELF PROTECTION </p><p>ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEM (SPEWS) II FROM BAE SYSTEMS NORTH </p><p>AMERICA (BAE), SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. MAJ GEN SCOTT </p><p>GRATION OF SAF/IA MET WITH THE TURKISH GENERAL STAFF (TGS) </p><p>AND TURKISH AIR FORCE COMMAND (TAFC) SENIOR LEADERSHIP ON </p><p>JULY 10 AND 11 REGARDING THE USG DECISION TO APPROVE THE </p><p>SALE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. THE USG\'S PRIMARY </p><p>RESTRICTION ON THE SALE IS THAT BAE MAY NOT RELEASE THE </p><p>SOFTWARE SOURCE CODE THAT CONTROLS THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE </p><p>JAMMER DIGITAL RF MEMORY (DRFM). END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BACKGROUND: FOR MANY YEARS,  TAFC HAS OPERATED THE </p><p>SPEWS I ON THEIR BLOCK 30 AND 40 F-16S. TAFC HAS BEEN IN THE </p><p>PROCESS OF PROCURING SPEWS II FOR SEVERAL YEARS, A FOLLOW-ON </p><p>ELECTRONIC WARFARE (EW) SUITE FOR THEIR BLOCK 50 F-16S FROM </p><p>BAE. HOWEVER, THE EXPORT LICENSE FOR SPEWS II HAS BEEN IN THE </p><p>APPROVAL PROCESS WITHIN THE USG INTERAGENCY FOR MANY MONTHS, </p><p>WITH A NUMBER OF CONTENTIOUS ISSUES TO RESOLVE. THE MOST </p><p>PROBLEMATIC HAS BEEN THE GOT\'S INSISTENCE ON FULL SOFTWARE </p><p>SOURCE CODE RELEASE. AT THE END OF JUNE 2003, THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>OF DEFENSE (DOD) (WITH STATE DEPARTMENT CONCURRENCE) REACHED </p><p>AN AGREEMENT TO APPROVE THE MASTER LICENSE AGREEMENT (MLA) </p><p>FOR SPEWS II, WITH LIMITING RESTRICTIONS. END BACKGROUND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MAJ GEN GRATION WAS ACCOMPANIED TO HIS MEETINGS BY </p><p>MAJOR GENERAL QUENTIN PETERSON AND MAJOR JOSE COLON OF THE </p><p>OFFICE OF DEFENSE COOPERATION, LT COL JOHN TAYLOR OF SAF/IA </p><p>AND STEELE MEANS OF THE POLITICAL MILITARY AFFAIRS SECTION. </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE MEETINGS, MAJ GEN GRATION </p><p>STRESSED THE FOLLOWING POINTS. FIRST, SPEWS II IS A </p><p>STATE-OF-THE-ART, DIGITAL EW SELF-PROTECTION SUITE, WHICH </p><p>WILL MEET TURKEY\'S OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND CAN BE </p><p>REPROGRAMMED IN-COUNTRY TO MEET CHANGING THREAT CONDITIONS. </p><p>TURKEY WILL GET ALL OF THE REQUIRED SOFTWARE SOURCE CODE TO </p><p>PERFORM ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND IN-COUNTRY REPROGRAMMING ON </p><p>THE SPEWS II SYSTEM, EXCLUDING THE DRFM SOURCE CODE. IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE USG IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT TURKEY IS </p><p>ABLE TO HAVE MODIFICATIONS AND UPDATES MADE TO THE SYSTEM, TO </p><p>INCLUDE WORK ON THE SOFTWARE NOT AUTHORIZED FOR GENERAL </p><p>RELEASE. MAJ GEN GRATION ALSO POINTED OUT THAT IF TAFC </p><p>DECIDES TO PURCHASE A NON-US EW SYSTEM, THERE WILL BE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT INTEGRATION PROBLEMS AND SCHEDULE DELAYS. SINCE </p><p>F-16 SOURCE CODE IS SUBJECT TO USG APPROVAL FOR RELEASE, </p><p>FRENCH OR ISRAELI EFFORTS WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WITHOUT </p><p>USG ASSISTANCE. FINALLY, TURKEY WILL HAVE CO-DEVELOPMENT </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DIGITAL RECEIVER SOURCE CODE -- A FIRST </p><p>FOR A US ALLY SINCE THIS LEVEL OF CO-PRODUCTION OF A MODERN </p><p>EW SUITE HAS NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED FOR EXPORT TO ANY OTHER </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MAJ GEN GRATION\'S FIRST MEETING ON JULY 10 WAS WITH </p><p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL TURGUT (TGS J5). TURGUT WAS SUPPORTIVE AND </p><p>CLEARLY STATED THERE SHOULD BE NO ARGUMENT, GIVEN THE FACT </p><p>THAT THE POLICY OF WITHHOLDING THE DRFM SOURCE CODE APPLIED </p><p>EQUALLY TO ALL COUNTRIES, AND THAT TURKEY WAS NOT BEING </p><p>SINGLED OUT FOR DISCRIMINATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE NEXT MEETING, LATER THAT AFTERNOON, WAS WITH A </p><p>TEAM OF TAFC OFFICERS, LED BY THE TAFC CHIEF OF PLANS/POLICY, </p><p>MAJ GEN BALANLI. BALANLI AND HIS TEAM VOICED A NUMBER OF </p><p>SERIOUS OBJECTIONS TO THE NON-RELEASE OF THE DRFM SOURCE </p><p>CODE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY CONSISTENTLY CLAIMED THAT BAE </p><p>HAD PROMISED THE GOT ALL OF THE SPEWS II SOURCE CODE IN THEIR </p><p>ORIGINAL CONTRACT AND THAT THE HIGH COST OF THE SYSTEM </p><p>INCLUDED ALL OF THE SOURCE CODE. SECOND, SINCE TAFC PLANS TO </p><p>OPERATE THE SYSTEM FOR MANY YEARS, THEY REQUIRE THE </p><p>INDIGENOUS CAPABILITY TO MODIFY AND UPDATE THE SYSTEM </p><p>SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. FINALLY, THEY CLAIMED THAT THE FRENCH </p><p>AND ISRAELIS WILL SELL THE GOT A SIMILAR EW SUITE WITHOUT ANY </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON SOURCE CODE RELEASE. THE UNDER SECRETARIAT OF </p><p>DEFENSE INDUSTRIES (SSM) HAS CONTINUED TO INSIST THAT THE </p><p>TERMS OF THE BAE PROPOSAL BE EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN THE </p><p>FRENCH THALES PROPOSAL, IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM AS </p><p>BUDGETED. GEN BALANLI SAID THAT THE REPORT OF THE MEETING </p><p>WOULD BE PASSED TO GEN ASPARUK, THE TAFC COMMANDER, IN </p><p>PREPARATION FOR THE JULY 11 MEETING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) IN A MEETING ON JULY 11, THE TAFC COMMANDER, GEN </p><p>ASPARUK, ECHOED SIMILAR CONCERNS AS THE TAFC TEAM THE DAY </p><p>BEFORE, BUT AGREED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PURCHASE OF SPEWS </p><p>II FROM BAE, DESPITE THE USG DECISION TO WITHHOLD THE DRFM </p><p>SOURCE CODE. AFTER DISCUSSIONS, GEN ASPARUK AGREED THAT, IN </p><p>ORDER FOR THE SALE TO MOVE FORWARD, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS </p><p>SHOULD BE TAKEN. FIRST, THE U.S. AIR FORCE (USAF) WILL </p><p>PROVIDE A LETTER TO TAFC ASSURING THAT THE USAF WILL HOLD THE </p><p>NON-RELEASABLE DRFM SOURCE CODE IN ESCROW IN THE UNLIKELY </p><p>EVENT THAT BAE IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROVIDE FURTHER </p><p>SOFTWARE UPDATES AND MODIFICATIONS. THIS IS TO ASSURE TAFC </p><p>THAT IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SOURCE CODE IN ORDER </p><p>TO MAKE UPGRADES OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE SYSTEM IN LATER </p><p>YEARS. SECOND, THAT WHEN/IF THE SOFTWARE HELD IN ESCROW IS </p><p>RELEASED, THE GOT WILL INCUR NO ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED </p><p>WITH THE RELEASE. FINALLY, BAE WILL PETITION SSM FOR A 20-30 </p><p>DAY EXTENSION BEYOND THE JULY 15 DEADLINE TO ALLOW FOR THE </p><p>SUBMISSION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED USAF LETTER AND ANY </p><p>AMENDMENTS TO THE BAE CONTRACT. GEN GRATION AGREED TO WORK </p><p>THE FIRST REQUEST AND PASS THE OTHER TWO REQUESTS TO BAE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: THE CLAIM BY TAFC THAT BAE HAD PROMISED THE </p><p>GOT ALL OF THE SPEWS II SOURCE CODE RAISES A POSSIBLE </p><p>COMPLIANCE ISSUE. ALTHOUGH BAE HAS DIRECTLY DENIED THAT THEY </p><p>MADE ANY SUCH PROMISE TO TAFC, SAF/IA IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING </p><p>THE CONTRACT WITH RESPECT TO THE TAFC CLAIM. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) THIS CABLE HAS BEEN CLEARED BY MAJ GEN GRATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
