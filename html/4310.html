<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003101 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ECON, PREL, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: "VOLUNTARY" CAP ON INTEREST RATES </p><p>UNPOPULAR WITH BANKERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  Most bankers see the October Bankers </p><p>Committee "voluntary" agreement to cap interest rates at 22.5 </p><p>percent as neither sustainable nor truly voluntary.  Some </p><p>industry insiders view the move as politically motivated. </p><p>The Central Bank and the Bankers Committee endorsed the </p><p>ceiling when the Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR) dropped but </p><p>presidential suasion failed to cause a corresponding </p><p>reduction in commercial rates.  Despite the unease, sources </p><p>predicted most banks would adhere to the new regulation and </p><p>manage to weather an estimated three-month period of less </p><p>than expected, and even negative returns of as much as 8-10 </p><p>percent.  (Note: Most deposits in Nigeria are on a 90-day </p><p>basis.)  This new development may separate the strong from </p><p>weak banks and increase the rate of failure among the weaker </p><p>institutions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p>2.  (U) President Olusegun Obasanjo made a surprise </p><p>appearance at the April Bankers Committee meeting to appeal </p><p>for reduced lending rates to spur economic growth.  Cheaper </p><p>credit would stimulate the non-oil economy, the President </p><p>argued.  The Bankers Committee created a sub-committee to </p><p>explore reduction of lending rates.  Despite considerable </p><p>political jawboning and a reduction in the MRR, there was no </p><p>significant immediate drop in interest rates as a result of </p><p>the Presidential entreaty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) However, continued pressure seems to have paid off. </p><p> At the October Bankers Committee meeting, Chief Executive of </p><p>Zenith International Bank Ltd. Jim Ovia, announced a rate </p><p>reduction from an average 35 percent to 22.5 percent.  He </p><p>confirmed the banks had agreed to cap lending rate at 400 </p><p>basis points above the CBN,s Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR), </p><p>currently 18.5 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>BANKS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>4. (U) Executive Director of Guaranty Trust Bank, Plc. (GTB) </p><p>Farouk Bello believes most banks will implement the new rate, </p><p>despite inevitable short-term losses. The agreement came </p><p>after CBN directives reducing the MRR from 22.5 to 18.5 </p><p>percent and the Cash Reserve Ratio from 12.5 percent to 9.5 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Bello estimates GTB will incur monthly losses of </p><p>Naira 50 to 80 million over the next quarter as his </p><p>certificates of deposits paying 25 to 28 percent expire.  GTB </p><p>operations are profitable, and he believes the bank will </p><p>adjust by tightening its belt and charging higher service </p><p>fees to partially offset the interest losses.  Some smaller, </p><p>less professionally run banks, he speculated, may circumvent </p><p>the guidelines because they cannot sustain losses.  "Some of </p><p>these smaller banks have a negative net worth.  Despite the </p><p>CBN\'s recent get-tough policy, the Government has no interest </p><p>in taking over bankrupt banks and depleting Nigerian Deposit </p><p>Insurance Corporation (NDIC) reserves," Bello asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>AVOIDING THE CAP: IF YOU CAN,T GO UP, GO AROUND </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Many banks may try to skirt the lower rates by </p><p>putting special conditions on new loans.  When interest rates </p><p>were capped in the early 1990s, many banks required borrowers </p><p>to deposit a portion of the loan in a non-interest bearing </p><p>special account for the life of the loan, effectively raising </p><p>the real interest rate.  Bello assured Econoff that even if </p><p>some mechanisms were proscribed, bankers would quickly find </p><p>new ways to circumvent the rate ceiling.  When asked why the </p><p>Bankers agreed to something they apparently disliked, Bello </p><p>claimed the CBN was prepared to unilaterally set the ceiling. </p><p>Politically, the banks were better off agreeing.  (Comment: </p><p>The cap also can be circumvented by increasing fees and </p><p>associated processing charges on loans. End Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) There is widespread skepticism among bankers that </p><p>lowering interest rates will stimulate the manufacturing and </p><p>agricultural sectors.  Bello believes likely beneficiaries </p><p>will be importers and traders, currently the main consumers </p><p>of bank credit.  Banks in Nigeria deal almost exclusively in </p><p>short-term credit for 90 or 180 days.  For the manufacturing </p><p>or large-scale agriculture to benefit loans would have to be </p><p>of much longer duration. Bello thought promoting industrial </p><p>development would best be done by subsidizing credit through </p><p>the Bank of Industry (BOI) and the Nigerian Agricultural </p><p>Credit Bank.  He claims merchant and commercial banks such as </p><p>his play a minimal role in this area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) COMMENT: The Nigerian economy and financial system </p><p>have been relatively resilient, toughing it out during this </p><p>lean revenue year.  The new interest rate ceiling may test </p><p>the strength of some banks and the regulatory capacity of the </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria to enforce it. Sustainability of the </p><p>new rate will greatly depend on the interplay of monetary and </p><p>fiscal policy and the perception of the business sector. </p><p>Cheap credit could lead to greater production, a fall in </p><p>prices, and even a reduction in inflation.  This would, </p><p>however, depend on government pursuit of a prudent fiscal </p><p>policy that minimizes deficit spending and earmarks </p><p>discretionary spending to productive sectors such as </p><p>agriculture.  Also, government and the CBN will have to take </p><p>additional steps to convince the business community that they </p><p>want to encourage increased production.  The private sector </p><p>must also be assured that the interest rate ceiling is real </p><p>and something the GON wants to sustain. However, the </p><p>convergence of these policies and actors will be a challenge </p><p>to the GON and its economic policy apparatus. If the rate </p><p>cannot be sustained as a part of an integrated economic </p><p>stimulus strategy, it may end up being short-sighted, and </p><p>ultimately counter-productive. END COMMENT </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
