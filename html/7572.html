(C) Below are the answers to ref (A), follow up questions </p><p>from GOT report: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 4.  According to MFA Second Secretary Belgin Ergunes, </p><p>the programs and activities referred to in this paragraph are </p><p>the seminars and trainings mentioned later in the report </p><p>(e.g., Panel on TIP hosted by the Directorate on the Problems </p><p>and Status of Women, MOI training seminars). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 8.  According to the Ministry of Interior (MOI), </p><p>officials from multiple MOI departments were chosen to </p><p>participate in a training program for educators devised by </p><p>the Bucharest organization "Fighting Against Organized Crime" </p><p>and the International Center for Migration Policy Development </p><p>(ICMPD).  These trainers conducted three training seminars in </p><p>Ankara, Istanbul, and Trabzon for a total of 75 MOI </p><p>officials.  The seminars discussed the following issues: (1) </p><p>methods of TIP; (2) development of new legal TIP </p><p>regulations/implementation of these new laws; (3) assistance </p><p>to victims; (4) identification of victims; (5) new </p><p>developments within law enforcement regarding TIP; (6) the </p><p>role of GOT TIP task force; and (7) improved victim </p><p>protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- According to MFA, there is as of yet no time frame for the </p><p>media training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 12.

According to Turkish National Police (TNP) DG </p><p>Mehmet Terzioglu, GOT has instructed governorates in 20 </p><p>cities to begin looking for buildings that could be renovated </p><p>and used as shelters.  GOT has contacted IOM regarding the </p><p>possibility of running a shelter; IOM has provided a concept </p><p>paper to the GOT.  Terzioglu stressed that GOT was looking at </p><p>possibilities for shelter funding.  GOT is exploring the </p><p>possibility of using EU funds for TIP purposes, including </p><p>shelters.  Currently, there are funds allocated within the </p><p>GOT budget for transportation, food, and medical check-ups </p><p>for foreigners, including TIP victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Investigation and Prosecution.  Three specialized units of </p><p>MOI have been targeted to receive TIP training: the law and </p><p>order units involved in prostitution, foreigners department, </p><p>and airport and seaport (border) units.  MOI hopes to </p><p>continue and expand current TIP training program, but funding </p><p>is difficult to find; the British Council funded the initial </p><p>three training seminars in Ankara, Istanbul, and Trabzon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Protection and Assistance </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 23.  Some victim identification training was included </p><p>in the MOI training.  These educators were trained by the </p><p>organization "Fighting Against Organized Crime" and ICMPD </p><p>(see Para 8 explanation). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 29.  MFA will provide as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 32.  According to MFA officials, the plan to assist </p><p>victims involves: (1) the issuance of a humanitarian visa if </p><p>appropriate; (2) rehabilitation; and (3) a health check-up. </p><p>MFA will supply additional information as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 35.  MFA will provide as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Below are the answers to ref (B), follow up questions </p><p>to Ankara 1396. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 8D.  Since August 2002, four cases have been brought </p><p>against traffickers under Article 201.  Of these, two </p><p>separate trials are underway in Ordu and Van provinces; </p><p>officials are still investigating the remaining two cases. </p><p>Additionally, 34 people have been apprehended under Article </p><p>201 (b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 6D.  According to MFA and MOI officials, MOI has </p><p>instructed governors to issue visas and residency permits to </p><p>TIP victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 6E.  This information was compiled in numerous </p><p>interviews with GOT officials (including prosecutors, </p><p>provincial officials, and central officials), newspaper </p><p>articles, NGOs (including IOM and other womens groups). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Para 6H.

Trabzon Governor Adil Yazar (since replaced) </p><p>stated that he had worked with a local NGO women\'s group to </p><p>help victims of trafficking by providing education on how to </p><p>make and sell consumables and handicrafts; the women who </p><p>benefited from the training were those whose husbands had </p><p>left them for "natashas."  He also told us he had worked </p><p>closely with the Trabzon police on TIP issues, urging them to </p><p>ensure all local police were kept well-informed of </p><p>TIP-related developments in Ankara. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
