<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 003407 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR WHA, EB, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: POSSIBLE CABINET SHAKEUP IN HONDURAS AS MADURO </p><p>LOOKS TO RECAPTURE MOMENTUM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer; Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  As President Ricardo Maduro staggers to his </p><p>first anniversary in office, there are emerging signs that he </p><p>will make some changes in his Cabinet in an effort to </p><p>recapture the political initiative in the country.  One </p><p>rumored change is a new Foreign Minister.  Other more </p><p>probable targets for turnover are the National Security, </p><p>Education, Health, Social Investment, Environment, and </p><p>International Foreign Assistance Coordination Ministers.  On </p><p>the other hand, former Honduran Ambassador to the U.S. and </p><p>current Government and Justice Minister Jorge Ramon Hernandez </p><p>Alcerro, is poised to win broader powers and influence as he </p><p>will be given a new office in the Casa Presidencial.  The </p><p>conventional political wisdom is that the President must act </p><p>now to remove ineffectual ministers and reinvigorate his </p><p>mandate.  According to political commentators, early </p><p>presidential campaigning will likely begin in January 2004, </p><p>at which time the Maduro government will begin its inevitable </p><p>slide toward lame-duck status.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Over the last two weeks there is a growing strength to </p><p>the rumor that current Foreign Minister Guillermo </p><p>Perez-Cadalso Arias will leave the Foreign Ministry to become </p><p>Rector of the National University (UNAH).  The Rector\'s </p><p>position at the autonomous UNAH is a high profile and very </p><p>political position that has been controlled by the Liberal </p><p>Party during the last eight years.  The Nationalists are now </p><p>poised to claim the spot.  However, there has been fierce </p><p>politicking over who should be the favored Nationalist </p><p>candidate.  Sources indicate that Perez-Cadalso is emerging </p><p>as a compromise candidate who appeals to the competing </p><p>Nationalist Party sectors.  The election for the new Rector </p><p>could take place this week or in early January at which time </p><p>Perez-Cadalso could leave the Foreign Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Perez-Cadalso has performed capably but without great </p><p>fanfare at the Foreign Ministry.  He has not taken any bold </p><p>initiatives but, while not a member of the tight Maduro inner </p><p>circle, conscientiously carried out Maduro Administration </p><p>foreign policies.  In particular, he has managed to lower the </p><p>previous screeching tenor of diplomatic exchanges related to </p><p>Honduras\' border conflicts with its neighbors.  His only </p><p>other lasting impact at the Foreign Ministry has been to </p><p>implement a crushing 18 per cent budget reduction that has </p><p>reduced the size of domestic and overseas diplomatic </p><p>operations.  Perez-Cadalso has done little to help Honduras </p><p>become a party to the seven outstanding international and OAS </p><p>counterterrorism conventions/protocols, but he did sign an </p><p>ICC Article 98 Agreement with the USG.  MFA DG for Foreign </p><p>Policy, AMB Mario Fortin, acknowledged the rumors of </p><p>Perez-Cadalso\'s possible departure but told PolOff December </p><p>19 that no decision had been made yet by President Maduro to </p><p>change the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Among rumored </p><p>replacements are current National Security Advisor Ramon </p><p>Medina Luna and Government and Justice Minister Jorge Ramon </p><p>Hernandez Alcerro. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Casa Presidencial and press reporting inform that </p><p>Hernandez Alcerro is poised to win broader powers and </p><p>influence as he will be given a new office in the Casa </p><p>Presidencial.  Political Section sources say that Hernandez </p><p>Alcerro is being brought into the Casa Presidencial to help </p><p>manage the President\'s political and communications </p><p>strategies.  He will continue to maintain his Ministerial </p><p>portfolio but will be given new (unspecified) authority to </p><p>manage the Administration\'s policy initiatives.  (COMMENT: </p><p>If true, Hernandez Alcerro will re-assume his campaign role </p><p>as the communications and policy czar.  In our view, </p><p>Hernandez Alcerro is the only member of the Maduro inner </p><p>circle who can approach the same level of confidence with the </p><p>President that Minister of the Presidency Luis Cosenza </p><p>maintains.  His entry into the Casa Presidencial could create </p><p>a significant counter-weight or complement to Cosenza\'s role. </p><p> Post notes that Cosenza has seemed to struggle at times as </p><p>Maduro\'s chief of staff.  We will watch closely to see how </p><p>the presidential ambitions of these two advisors influence </p><p>internal presidential decisionmaking.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ramon Medina Luna\'s departure from the Casa </p><p>Presidencial and/or his National Security portfolio has been </p><p>rumored since last July.  However, he is a charter member of </p><p>the Maduro inner circle and, by inside accounts, continues to </p><p>retain significant access to the President and direct </p><p>involvement in the presidential decision-making process.  He </p><p>is the Minister that Members of Congress most detest. </p><p>(COMMENT:  In our view, a move to the Foreign Ministry would </p><p>further complicate the Maduro Administration\'s relations with </p><p>Congress. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The ministers most likely to be removed in the short </p><p>time are the Education, Health, and Social Investment Fund </p><p>(FHIS).  Education Minister Carlos Avila was recently voted </p><p>the worst minister by the media and is a lightening rod for </p><p>complaints by secondary schoolteachers about the Maduro </p><p>Administration\'s hard-line salary negotiating tactics. </p><p>(Maduro, however, has publicly supported Avila and extolled </p><p>his virtues.)  The Health Minister, Elias Lizardo, while </p><p>getting high marks for his professional approach to the </p><p>Ministry, is being criticized for not placing more </p><p>Nationalist party activists in Ministry positions.  Finally, </p><p>FHIS Minister, Leony Yu-way, is viewed as not directing FHIS </p><p>projects to Nationalist party interests in the departments. </p><p>(According to political sources, this reticence is not a </p><p>resistance to corruption as much as it is his unwillingness </p><p>to treat FHIS projects as a political and legislative pork </p><p>barrel.)  Other Ministers whose names have been the subject </p><p>of press speculation are Environment and Natural Resources </p><p>Minister Patricia Panting (who is the chair of the ENEE Board </p><p>of Directors and could be chosen as a scapegoat if the GOH </p><p>decides to overturn the results of the recent controversial </p><p>electricity licitation) and International Foreign Assistance </p><p>Coordination (SETCO) Brenie Matute. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: As President Maduro staggers to his first </p><p>anniversary in office, he is clearly grasping for a way to </p><p>recapture the political initiative.  The conventional </p><p>political wisdom is the President must act now to remove </p><p>ineffectual ministers and reinvigorate his mandate.  Maduro </p><p>recently reiterated publicly that he would regularly review </p><p>Ministerial performance.  Two ministers (Security Ministry </p><p>Arias and Trade Minister Handal) were forced out earlier this </p><p>year after they were no longer producing desired results.  A </p><p>change in some Ministers would also allow Maduro to win some </p><p>points with Nationalists (especially in Congress) for </p><p>responding to their criticism about the overly technocratic </p><p>makeup of his government.  According to political </p><p>commentators, early presidential campaigning will likely </p><p>begin in January 2004 at which time the Maduro government </p><p>will begin its inevitable slide toward lame-duck status. </p><p>Given this time-frame, some advisors are suggesting that </p><p>President Maduro cannot delay making changes to Ministers who </p><p>are not performing well.  Maduro, himself, has fared poorly </p><p>in popularity polls.  He states, however, that he is not </p><p>concerned about his popularity as long as he is acting in the </p><p>best interest of the Honduran people.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
