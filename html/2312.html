<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 003273 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 12/16/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PINS, VM, KRIF, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: QNEW CHALLENGES FOR THE RECENTLY RECOGNIZED PROTESTANTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY POL/C SCOTT D. BELLARD, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03273  01 OF 02  171030Z </p><p>REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY:  ACCORDING TO TWO CREDIBLE </p><p>SOURCES, SINCE OFFICIAL GVN RECOGNITION OF THE </p><p>SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM (SECV) IN </p><p>APRIL, THE GVN HAS TRIED TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF </p><p>SECV CHURCHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS PROVINCE OF LAM DONG, AND TO FILL A </p><p>NUMBER OF SECV LEADERSHIP POSITIONS WITH ITS OWN </p><p>NOMINEES.  GVN OFFICIALS DENY THIS.  WHILE THE SECV </p><p>IS AT LEAST AUTHORIZED TO EXIST LEGALLY, MANY OF </p><p>ITS ACTIVITIES STILL REMAIN UNDERGROUND.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  PASTOR TINH, (STRICTLY PROTECT), A </p><p>PROTESTANT MINISTER WITH ASSOCIATES THROUGHOUT </p><p>VIETNAM AND A LONGTIME EMBASSY AND CONGEN CONTACT, </p><p>MET POLOFF ON DECEMBER 6 IN HANOI AND DESCRIBED </p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SECV SINCE ITS OFFICIAL </p><p>RECOGNITION BY THE GVN EIGHT MONTHS AGO.  A WELL- </p><p>INFORMED THIRD COUNTRY NATIONAL (TCN) SOURCE, WHO </p><p>HAS ASKED NOT TO BE NAMED, MET WITH POLOFF ON </p><p>DECEMBER 8 AND 10 IN HANOI.  BOTH ALSO DISCUSSED </p><p>CLERGY TRAINING, HOUSE CHURCHES AND ISSUES RELATED </p><p>TO MONTAGNARD AND H\'MONG MINORITY PROTESTANTS </p><p>(SEPTELS).  NGUYEN VAN NGOC, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>GVN COMMITTEE ON RELIGION, MET POL/C AND POLOFF ON </p><p>DECEMBER 13 AND PROVIDED A GVN PERSPECTIVE ON THE </p><p>EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GVN AND THE SECV. </p><p> </p><p>NEW LIMITS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03273  01 OF 02  171030Z </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C )  ACCORDING TO PASTOR TINH AND THE TCN, GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS, ESPECIALLY IN LAM DONG PROVINCE, ARE </p><p>TELLING SECV LEADERS THAT THEY WILL ONLY RECOGNIZE </p><p>ONE SECV CHURCH IN EACH DISTRICT.  THE TCN </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE GVN WAS IMPLEMENTING THIS </p><p>DECISION BY ALLOWING THE SECV TO BUILD ONLY ONE NEW </p><p>BUILDING, OR RECONVERT OR REFURBISH ONLY ONE PRE- </p><p>1975 CHURCH BUILDING PER DISTRICT.  FEW, IF ANY, </p><p>PRE-1975 CHURCH BUILDINGS HAD BEEN USED AS HOUSES </p><p>OF WORSHIP IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO LACK OF LEGAL </p><p>STATUS, HE NOTED.  THE TCN SAID THAT HE HAD LEARNED </p><p>FROM SECV LEADERS THAT THE GVN HAD TOLD CHURCH </p><p>LEADERS THAT ALL CHURCH MEETINGS IN LAM DONG WERE </p><p>ONLY TO BE HELD IN THE AUTHORIZED CHURCH BUILDINGS. </p><p>(COMMENT:  MANY SECV CONGREGATIONS MET AS "HOUSE </p><p>CHURCHES" FOR YEARS.  MANY OBSERVERS HOPED THAT GVN </p><p>RECOGNITION OF THE SECV WOULD ALLOW THESE MEETINGS </p><p>TO BE HELD OPENLY.  END COMMENT.) THE TCN SAID THAT </p><p>SINCE THERE WERE NOW "AUTHORIZED" PLACES TO MEET, </p><p>THE GVN COULD CONSIDER ILLEGAL ANY CHURCH MEETINGS </p><p>HELD ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C )  ACCORDING TO PASTOR TINH, THE ONE CHURCH </p><p>PER DISTRICT POLICY IMPOSES HARDSHIPS ON CHURCH </p><p>MEMBERS IN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS BECAUSE THE </p><p>"AUTHORIZED" CHURCH BUILDINGS ARE TOO SMALL AND TOO </p><p>FAR APART TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE LOCAL SECV </p><p>WORSHIPERS.  PASTOR TINH CONFIRMED THAT WHEN </p><p>CONGREGATIONS TRIED TO CONTINUE TO MEET ON A "HOUSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03273  01 OF 02  171030Z </p><p>CHURCH" BASIS, THEY WERE HARASSED BY THE POLICE. </p><p>HE SAID THAT THEY HAVE NOW REGROUPED IN SMALLER </p><p>"CELL CHURCHES" COMPOSED OF ABOUT 5-12 ADULTS, WITH </p><p>NO MORE THAN ABOUT 20 WORSHIPPERS OVERALL.  SO FAR, </p><p>PASTOR TINH NOTED, THE SMALLER MEETINGS HAVE NOT </p><p>ATTRACTED POLICE ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  WHEN ASKED ABOUT GVN REGULATION OF THE </p><p>NUMBER OF SECV CHURCHES, VICE CHAIRMAN NGOC </p><p>INSISTED THAT THERE WAS NO GVN LIMIT ON THE NUMBER </p><p>OF CHURCHES.  HE SAID THAT THE NUMBER OF CHURCHES </p><p>WAS UP TO THE SECV, BUT HE ADDED THAT THE GVN WAS </p><p>CONCERNED THAT CHURCHES BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. </p><p>EACH CHURCH, HE SAID, SHOULD BE LARGE ENOUGH TO </p><p>SUPPORT ITSELF, INCLUDING PROVIDING FOR ITS PASTOR </p><p>AND HIS FAMILY.  VICE CHAIRMAN NGOC CITED THE </p><p>FIGURE OF 500 MEMBERS FOR A VIABLE CHURCH.  IN </p><p>REPLY TO A QUESTION, HE CLARIFIED THAT IT WAS NOT A </p><p>GVN REQUIREMENT THAT A CHURCH HAVE AT LEAST 500 </p><p>MEMBERS AND THAT CHURCH SIZE WAS UP TO THE SECV. </p><p>HE SAID THERE WERE NOW 300-400 SECV CHURCHES IN </p><p>ALL, SERVED BY OVER 200 PASTORS AND ASSOCIATES. </p><p> </p><p>NEW STRUCTURE </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03273  02 OF 02  171030Z </p><p>7.  (C ) PASTOR TINH DESCRIBED THE SECV\'S </p><p>REORGANIZATION THAT HAD BEEN A NECESSARY PART OF </p><p>THE PROCESS OF GAINING GVN RECOGNITION  THE FORMER </p><p>"GENERAL EVANGELICAL COUNCIL" WAS REPLACED BY A NEW </p><p>THE "GENERAL COMMITTEE," WHOSE MEMBERSHIP WAS </p><p>SELECTED BASED ON A SECV/GVN CONSENSUS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>PASTOR TINH CLAIMED THAT TWO "GENERAL COMMITTEE" </p><p>MEMBERS, PASTORS THANH AND BUU, ARE NOW WORKING </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE GVN COMMITTEE ON RELIGION.  BOTH </p><p>PASTOR TINH AND THE TCN REPORTED THAT SOME CURRENT </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE SECV LEADERSHIP, WHICH THEY CLAIMED </p><p>HAD BEEN INSTALLED WITH GVN SUPPORT, ARE SUSPECTED </p><p>OF DIVULGING UNDERGROUND CHURCH ACTIVITIES TO THE </p><p>GVN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C )  ANOTHER ASPECT OF SECV REORGANIZATION WAS </p><p>TO REPLACE "DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES" AS </p><p>INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN THE SECV LEADERSHIP AND </p><p>LOCAL CHURCHES WITH A SMALLER NUMBER OF "PROVINCIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES."  WHILE THE "GENERAL COMMITTEE" </p><p>NOMINATES "PROVINCIAL REPRESENTATIVES," PASTOR TINH </p><p>SAID THAT THE GVN COMMITTEE ON RELIGION HAD VETOED </p><p>A NUMBER OF THE CHURCH\'S NOMINEES FOR "PROVINCIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE" POSTS AND SUBSTITUTED ITS OWN </p><p>CHOICES.  ACCORDING TO PASTOR TINH, THE SECV\'S </p><p>"GENERAL COMMITTEE" DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO </p><p>REJECT THE GVN COMMITTEE ON RELIGION\'S CHOICES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U ) SEPARATELY, IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION, VICE </p><p>CHAIRMAN NGOC ASSERTED THAT THE GVN HAD NO ROLE </p><p>WHATSOEVER IN SELECTING OR APPROVING EITHER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03273  02 OF 02  171030Z </p><p>"GENERAL COMMITTEE" MEMBERS OR "PROVINCIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES."  HE ALSO REPLIED THAT IT WAS UP </p><p>TO THE PASTORS IN EACH PROVINCE TO DECIDE UPON </p><p>THEIR REPRESENTATIVE(S) AMONG THEMSELVES IN FREE </p><p>ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C ) PASTOR TINH CLAIMED SPECIFICALLY THAT </p><p>FEAR OF "BAD" LEADERS LIKE "GENERAL COMMITTEE" </p><p>MEMBERS THANH AND BUU AND THE GVN-SELECTED </p><p>"PROVINCIAL REPRESENTATIVES" KEEPS MANY CHURCH </p><p>ACTIVITIES UNDERGROUND.  THE TCN CLAIMED THAT HIS </p><p>VIETNAMESE CONTACTS FIND HIM BETTER INFORMED THAN </p><p>THEY ARE ON MANY CHURCH ISSUES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT </p><p>SURE WHOM THEY CAN TRUST. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C )  COMMENT:  GOVERNMENT RECOGNITION HAS HAD </p><p>SOME BENEFITS FOR THE SECV, SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO </p><p>ARRANGE FOR LEGAL PUBLICATION OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>MATERIALS THROUGH THE GVN COMMITTEE ON RELIGION\'S </p><p>PUBLISHING HOUSE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF REOPENING A </p><p>SEMINARY.  NONETHELESS, SOME PROTESTANTS LIKE </p><p>PASTOR TINH ARE INCREASINGLY SKEPTICAL OR </p><p>AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE WISDOM OF THE SECV HAVING </p><p>SOUGHT AND OBTAINED OFFICIAL RECOGNITION.  SECV </p><p>INTERNAL POLITICS MAY ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN THE </p><p>MISTRUST AMONG SOME OF ITS LEADERS; PASTOR TINH </p><p>MENTIONED THAT BOTH PASTOR THANH AND PASTOR BUU HAD </p><p>TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY IN THE PAST TO BECOME </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE SECV.  BUT THE GVN\'S OWN </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC REGULATORY APPROACH TO RELIGION, AND </p><p>MOST OTHER ISSUES, PROBABLY DOES NOT MESH WELL WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03273  02 OF 02  171030Z </p><p>THE FLUID WAYS OF VIETNAM\'S PROTESTANT LEADERS, </p><p>USED TO DECADES OF FREEWHEELING UNDERGROUND </p><p>ACTIVITY.  ON BALANCE, RECOGNITION IS NEITHER A </p><p>PANACEA NOR NECESSARILY PART OF A SINISTER PLOT TO </p><p>BRING RELIGION UNDER COMPLETE GVN AND COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY OF VIETNAM CONTROL. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
