(SBU)  Summary:  Two staffers from the U.S. </p><p>Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe </p><p>(aka Helsinki Commission) traveled to Diyarbakir </p><p>January 15-18 for meetings with GOT officials, human </p><p>rights activists, and religious groups.  Key agenda </p><p>items included torture, language rights, and village </p><p>return.  (Staffers\' discussions regarding religious </p><p>freedom issues reported septel.)  In all areas of </p><p>concern, staffers noted gaps between reforms pledged </p><p>and reforms implemented.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The staffers - Chadwick W. Gore, Commission </p><p>Staff Advisor and Secretary to the U.S. Delegation </p><p>to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, and H. Knox </p><p>Thames, Commission Staff Counsel - met in Diyarbakir </p><p>January 15-18 with GOT officials, locally elected </p><p>officials, and human rights activists in order to </p><p>assess progress in implementation of human-rights </p><p>reform legislation (Refs B - E). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Torture - Still a Problem </p><p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The number of  terrorism-related arrests is </p><p>down, and so is the incidence of torture, Gore and </p><p>Thames were told in January 15 meetings with Hakki </p><p>Uzun,  Deputy Regional Governor for the former State </p><p>of Emergency Region, and Sait Gurlek,  Diyarbakir </p><p>Province Chief Public Prosecutor.  (Note: As the </p><p>State of Emergency has been lifted, Uzun is now </p><p>presiding over the closing down of his office. </p><p>Saying he is under no particular deadline, he and </p><p>his staff were in the process of filing, archiving, </p><p>and handling administrative tasks.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (U)  Gore and Thames met January 16 with </p><p>Huseyin Nail Atay, a Deputy Governor of Diyarbakir </p><p>Province.  In this meeting, as in others with GOT </p><p>officials, the staffers handed over a copy of a </p><p>letter to PM Gul signed by Members of Congress from </p><p>the U.S. Helsinki Commission.  The letter contained </p><p>praise for the new government\'s expressed </p><p>commitments to human-rights reform while noting </p><p>ongoing problems in that regard.   Torture was at </p><p>the top.    Atay defended the GOT\'s recent record on </p><p>torture as one of "great progress."  He did not deny </p><p>abuses had occurred, and do still occur, but </p><p>commented that "at the individual level, government </p><p>officials make mistakes, in the United States, too." </p><p>He went on to state that the HADEP party\'s </p><p>provincial chairman had recently admitted that there </p><p>had been no cases of torture of late."  (Note: We </p><p>were not able to confirm this remark.  End note.) </p><p>The province had built a new prison - a very </p><p>expensive undertaking.  It met EU standards, he </p><p>asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Gore and Thames met January 17 with a </p><p>group of lawyers, physicians, and founding members </p><p>of the Diyarbakir chapter of the Human Rights </p><p>Foundation  (HRF) to discuss torture. According to </p><p>the HRF representatives, it was too early to tell </p><p>whether recent legal reforms were having an effect </p><p>on torture.  After the raft of EU-inspired reforms, </p><p>and after the lifting of the State of Emergency two </p><p>months ago, there was now even less reason for </p><p>Turkish authorities to turn a blind eye to torture </p><p>allegations, they reasoned.  Nevertheless, they </p><p>said, to date in Diyarbakir no police, security </p><p>officials, or Jandarma have been brought to book. </p><p>In 2002, the HRF received 80 new allegations of </p><p>torture.  (Note: That means 80 cases first brought </p><p>to their attention in 2002, not 80 cases that </p><p>occurred in 2002.  End note.)   How was it possible, </p><p>they asked, that not a single torturer had been </p><p>punished, even when subsequent medical examination </p><p>can confirm physical injury?  The staffers noted the </p><p>instance of torture in Turkey was widely agreed to </p><p>be decreasing, but asked the HRF about what it was </p><p>seeing in its Diyarbakir office.  The HRF members </p><p>replied that the statistics could be tricky; even </p><p>though torture may nowadays be less common, the </p><p>number of cases actually being reported to the HRF </p><p>was not decreasing.  Cases from yesteryear are still </p><p>popping up.  Since 1999 there have been  fewer </p><p>detentions and arrests; however, the HRF claims, the </p><p>people-in-custody/people-being-tortured ratio has </p><p>not fundamentally changed.   For 2002, the HRF </p><p>provided the following statistics.  Number of cases </p><p>reported: 188.  Number of cases reported that </p><p>alleged political reasons for detention: 186. </p><p>Number of cases reported that were males: 141. </p><p>Female: 32.  Children: 15.  Number of cases reported </p><p>that were acute: 32.  Number of cases reported that </p><p>were chronic: 156. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  In documenting the practice of torture, </p><p>HRF members told the staffers they had observed </p><p>that, as is widely known, practitioners had gotten </p><p>more sophisticated.  "Subtler" techniques, designed </p><p>to leave no trace, had been devised.  These include: </p><p>hosing with cold water followed by exposure to cold </p><p>weather or air-conditioning, use of blindfolds, </p><p>painfully loud music, plastic bags to create </p><p>breathlessness, applying gels before using electric </p><p>shock, sand-filled bags instead of clubs for </p><p>beatings, pointing of cocked weapons, and verbal </p><p>threats up to and including death threats. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  A related risk for detained individuals - </p><p>denial of access to lawyers - persists, according to </p><p>HRF members, who described for the staffers a recent </p><p>case in Diyarbakir province in which a large group </p><p>of students was detained.  The security official in </p><p>charge at first denied access to a lawyer, </p><p>apparently unaware that recent changes in Turkish </p><p>legislation guarantee access within 48 hours. </p><p>Access was granted, however, after HRF members </p><p>provided copies of the text of the new legislation. </p><p>After the lawyer had met with the students, however, </p><p>the security director attempted to hold onto the </p><p>lawyer\'s notes.  (Note:  The students had been </p><p>arrested for conducting a protesting against the </p><p>alleged enforced isolation in recent weeks of </p><p>imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  In summary, the HRF members said torture </p><p>is difficult to eradicate in the region, and </p><p>torturers continue to enjoy impunity, because the </p><p>prevailing mind-set is that what is going on "is </p><p>being done for the well-being of the State and the </p><p>State accepts this as necessary."  One will look in </p><p>vain, they said, for examples of concrete steps </p><p>taken by the State to police itself in this regard, </p><p>that is, convictions of torturers, or even thorough </p><p>investigation of allegations, or even unannounced </p><p>inspections of detention centers.   The HRF claims </p><p>that in the past 17 years, although charges have </p><p>sometimes been brought, not a single public employee </p><p>has been convicted of torture in Diyarbakir </p><p>province. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) The staffers also discussed torture </p><p>January 17 with representatives of the Diyarbakir </p><p>Chamber of Doctors and Physicians Treating Torture </p><p>Victims.   (Note: The Chamber is basically a roster </p><p>of doctors who make themselves available to treat </p><p>torture victims.  End note.)  Chamber </p><p>representatives said recently reported torture </p><p>techniques included exposure while naked to cold </p><p>water and air conditioning, electric shock, and </p><p>squeezing of the testicles.  On a psychological </p><p>level, noted the Chamber representatives, state </p><p>authorities also know how to bring pressure to bear </p><p>on patients.  For example, it is common for law- </p><p>enforcement officers to sit in the room while the </p><p>doctor examines the patient, thereby creating </p><p>intimidation.  The authorities have also taken </p><p>action against certain doctors involved in treating </p><p>torture victims.  For example, two HRF doctors were </p><p>recently reassigned from their position at a state- </p><p>run hospital in Diyarbakir to smaller, outlying </p><p>districts.  (Note:  A doctor is free to open a </p><p>private-practice, but doctors in the public sector </p><p>must serve where assigned.  End note.)  The two have </p><p>repeatedly applied for reassignment but have been </p><p>stuck in place.  Other Diyarbakir doctors have </p><p>suffered even more, serving prison sentences for </p><p>having treated PKK members - wittingly or </p><p>unwittingly.  Upon release from prison, their </p><p>ability to practice medicine has been curtailed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  In a January 17 meeting the staffers </p><p>asked Saban Erturk, Diyarbakir State Security Court </p><p>(SSC) Chief Prosecutor, whether he had any current </p><p>investigations underway that might lead to the </p><p>prosecution of alleged torturers.  He replied that </p><p>the SSC did not handle torture cases; they were </p><p>handled by the regular criminal courts.  Erturk said </p><p>changes in Turkish law (refs B and C) demonstrate </p><p>that the Government was serious about ending the </p><p>practice.  "Any torturers will be accountable," he </p><p>said.  He welcomed the idea of unannounced visits to </p><p>detention centers.  When asked if the frequent </p><p>discrepancy between statements given by detainees </p><p>while in custody and statements given by detainees </p><p>at trial might be attributable to torture, the </p><p>Prosecutor said no.  "They lie," he said.  (Note: </p><p>In the Turkish legal system, a defendant cannot be </p><p>charged with perjury.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.    (SBU)  The Chief Prosecutor praised the SSC </p><p>system as being an elite system.  (Note: He himself </p><p>has 22 years experience as a prosecutor, and is now </p><p>one of only seven Chief Prosecutors in the nation - </p><p>arguably the one with the toughest circuit.   He is </p><p>also a former International Visitor Program grantee. </p><p>End note.)   He said the judges in the SSC system </p><p>were first-rate and that 80 percent of the cases </p><p>ended in conviction.  In this way, he said, the SSCs </p><p>are fulfilling their mission of protecting the </p><p>Turkish people from terrorism.  He commented that </p><p>Americans often consider as "rights" certain </p><p>activities that are explicitly prohibited by Turkish </p><p>law, for example, questioning the indivisibility of </p><p>the state or fomenting division along religious or </p><p>Marxist grounds.   He had been to America and </p><p>admired its "vastness of freedom of expression," he </p><p>said, but Americans must remember that "in this </p><p>country thousands of people had been killed by </p><p>terrorists and up in the mountains there were still </p><p>hundreds of terrorists".  (Note: The day before, </p><p>January 16, in Lice in Diyarbakir Province, a clash </p><p>between Turkish military and PKK elements had </p><p>resulted in one death and five wounded on the </p><p>military side and an undisclosed number of </p><p>casualties on the PKK side.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Language Rights - Still Waiting </p><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  The staffers asked Diyarbakir Province </p><p>Deputy Governor Atay whether broadcasting in Kurdish </p><p>would begin any time soon. Atay replied, rather </p><p>tangentially, that it was a mistake to consider </p><p>Kurdish as a single language; there were several </p><p>quite distinct dialects.  The staffers said they </p><p>were aware of that, but were asking an </p><p>administrative question not a linguistic one.  "In </p><p>the course of time it will probably happen," Atay </p><p>opined.  Kurdish cassettes and videos now circulate </p><p>freely, he added.  The staffers expressed the view </p><p>that most international observers had assumed, after </p><p>the passage of the recent legislation, that </p><p>broadcasts would begin in a matter of days or weeks. </p><p>Again, Mr. Atay replied obliquely, saying there had </p><p>been an experience with local Kurdish-language </p><p>television, but it had turned out to be </p><p>"separatist." This time control would be vested in </p><p>TRT, the Turkish state television network.  Private </p><p>Kurdish-language television channels in the future </p><p>were a possibility, he believed.  In any case, the </p><p>authorities have stopped trying to control the </p><p>spread of satellite dishes; Kurds in Turkey have </p><p>access to Kurdish-language programming from abroad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  In a separate meeting, members of the </p><p>Diyarbakir Bar Association told Poleconoff and FSN </p><p>Pol Assistant that the government was not making </p><p>serious efforts to lift all obstacles to the use of </p><p>Kurdish.  They said the Bar Association has sued </p><p>RTUK (Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council) </p><p>over this issue.  They believe the implementing </p><p>regulation does not meet the spirit, or the letter, </p><p>of the reform legislation passed in Parliament. </p><p>Some Bar Association members went further, and </p><p>stated that the cynical intent of RTUK and the </p><p>Turkish authorities was to placate European critics </p><p>while actually using Kurdish-language broadcasting </p><p>as a tool for further cultural assimilation.  In </p><p>this regard, they pointed out certain restrictions </p><p>in the RTUK regulations (ref D) which, they said, </p><p>undermined the spirit of the reform legislation. </p><p>Concerning the use of Kurdish in classroom </p><p>education, they ask, why should Kurds still be </p><p>denied the kind of language-independence that was </p><p>long ago granted to Greeks and Armenians by the 1923 </p><p>Lausanne Treaty, especially since there are so few </p><p>Greeks and Armenians left in Turkey?  When asked </p><p>about the practical day-to-day use of Kurdish in </p><p>courtrooms, Bar Association members said that </p><p>Turkish-Kurdish courtroom translation was haphazard, </p><p>ad hoc, and at times denied.  Those accused of a </p><p>crime were not granted the opportunity to read the </p><p>indictment in Kurdish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Village Returns - Slow Going </p><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  The Turkish Red Crescent\'s Regional </p><p>Director in Diyarbakir, Muzaffer Karadede, argued </p><p>that village return was of interest to the elderly </p><p>and was not much sought after by young people. The </p><p>villages have no jobs.  Additionally, the loss/lack </p><p>of infrastructure and the obliteration of the </p><p>villages\' former familial-communal support system </p><p>make return less enticing.  Karadede, an </p><p>ophthalmologist who spent a good portion of his </p><p>professional career in Istanbul, is from an old </p><p>Diyarbakir family.  He can hardly believe the </p><p>transformation his city has undergone.  On top of </p><p>what might normally have been expected for rural-to- </p><p>urban migration in a country like Turkey, the long </p><p>fight against the PKK drove so many villagers into </p><p>Diyarbakir city that he now estimates that more than </p><p>90 percent of the people living in the city were not </p><p>born there.  Not a single member of the Diyarbakir </p><p>city council was born in Diyarbakir.  In his view, </p><p>given that the Turkish state never did much for </p><p>peasants in the region\'s villages anyway, it was </p><p>hardly surprising that not much was being done now. </p><p>Karadede also asserted that the village guard system </p><p>was now serving as a major factor in discouraging </p><p>returns, and that the village guard system has taken </p><p>on some of the characteristics of the region\'s old </p><p>"aga" (feudal landlord) system, in which might makes </p><p>right. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  The village guard system was raised by </p><p>staffers Gore and Thames with Diyarbakir Deputy </p><p>Governor Atay.  Now that the PKK had been defeated, </p><p>they asked, why was the village guard system not </p><p>being dismantled and why were the guards themselves </p><p>not being demobilized and disarmed?  Atay began his </p><p>response by noting that as far back as the "Village </p><p>Administration Law" of 1924 there had been </p><p>provisions for something similar in the region.  Be </p><p>that as it may, it was not now possible to eliminate </p><p>the village guard system all at once.  Village </p><p>guards were on the state payroll and would not take </p><p>well to being dropped from it.  The GOT planned to </p><p>reduce their number gradually, through attrition, by </p><p>not appointing any new ones.  Also, in the future, </p><p>their duties may be changed, e.g. to janitors in </p><p>schools.  (Comment:  The staffers expressed some </p><p>incredulity that a village guard might want to trade </p><p>in his gun for a broom.  End comment.)  To what </p><p>degree, asked the staffers, was village return being </p><p>thwarted by village guards squatting on others\' </p><p>land, intimidating, and using violence?  The </p><p>problem, replied Atay, was exaggerated.  In the few </p><p>cases where village guards had abused their </p><p>authority, they had been arrested and dismissed. </p><p>Sometimes what appeared as a case of village-guard </p><p>violence had as its underlying cause a traditional </p><p>blood feud.  The bad example of some village guards, </p><p>he said, should not be used to obscure the fact that </p><p>"the village guards and the Army were part of a </p><p>successful struggle for the territorial integrity of </p><p>the country." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  Leaving aside the debate about alleged </p><p>obstacles to return (village guard, paperwork, no </p><p>jobs, no infrastructure, lack of government </p><p>investment), the staffers tried to ascertain how </p><p>many villages in Diyarbakir province had in fact </p><p>been re-opened for return and how many had actually </p><p>seen returns  The only specific numbers came from </p><p>the office of Deputy Governor Atay: 90 villages </p><p>("koy") and 303 hamlets ("mezra") evacuated during </p><p>the conflict, of which 48 villages and 58 hamlets </p><p>had seen returns.  Twelve villages had had requests </p><p>for return that were denied -- on security grounds. </p><p>As for the remaining 275 villages/hamlets, there had </p><p>so far been no request.  (Note: To place this number </p><p>in context, it is estimated that more than 3,200 </p><p>villages or hamlets in southeastern Turkey were </p><p>evacuated during the course of the struggle between </p><p>Turkish forces and the PKK.  End note.) </p><p>17.  (SBU)  The staffers met with displaced </p><p>villagers.  The Deputy Governor\'s office arranged </p><p>for the staffers to visit Saklatkoy, a village </p><p>outside Diyarbakir to which return had been approved </p><p>and in fact achieved.  The village had electricity </p><p>but no plumbing.  Many structures were damaged, but </p><p>many have been repaired, and even some new ones have </p><p>been built, including a new primary school building. </p><p>The villager headman (muhtar), a man with three </p><p>wives and 23 children, expressed appreciation for </p><p>the chance to return.  Other villagers echoed this </p><p>sentiment in their conversations with Gore and </p><p>Thames, which took place with a representative of </p><p>the Turkish government present.  Their only fear, </p><p>they said, was that the PKK might come back.  Upon </p><p>being driven back to Diyarbakir, the staffers had a </p><p>chance to meet with a family that had not managed to </p><p>return to its village (Koprulu, Mardin Province). </p><p>The head of household was an illiterate itinerant </p><p>laborer with 10 children. He claimed to have been </p><p>denied permission to work as a pushcart peddler in </p><p>Diyarbakir, and therefore leaves home for months at </p><p>a time to live with his brother and work on </p><p>construction sites in Izmir, some 700 miles away. </p><p>He said he had unsuccessfully applied to return with </p><p>his family to his village.  He was told that he </p><p>would be allowed to return -- if he would agree to </p><p>serve in the village guard.  He refused:  "It\'s no </p><p>good; brothers are going to kill brothers." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.    (SBU)  Comment:  It would appear that </p><p>staffers Gore and Thames came away from Diyarbakir </p><p>somewhat underwhelmed by the degree of actual </p><p>implementation of human-rights reforms undertaken by </p><p>the Turkish government.  As they explained to more </p><p>than one interlocutor, the international community </p><p>expected that reform efforts designed to make </p><p>torturers accountable, ease language restrictions, </p><p>and promote village returns would be bear fruit in a </p><p>matter of days/weeks, not months/years.  Their </p><p>report to the Congress is likely to conclude that </p><p>human-reform pledges of the Turkish government still </p><p>await implementation on the ground.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U)  Gore and Thames did not have an </p><p>opportunity to clear this message. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
