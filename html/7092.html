<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000884 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, CASC, SNAR, PHUM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 834 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 781 </p><p>     C. GUATEMALA 770 </p><p>     D. GUATEMALA 735 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador John R. Hamilton.  Reason 1.5 (B&D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Ambassador Hamilton met with Minister of </p><p>Government Jose Adolfo Reyes Calderon March 31 to express </p><p>concern about a recent case involving torture by security </p><p>forces in an anti-narcotics raid in Zacapa.  The Ambassador </p><p>also raised the murder of an American citizen on March 28, </p><p>threats against USAID contractors, and property destruction </p><p>by squatters at a ranch owned by AmCits in Alta Verapaz </p><p>province.  Reyes Calderon implied that he suspected that the </p><p>military was responsible for any use of torture in the Zacapa </p><p>case and claimed to have recently reiterated his absolute </p><p>rejection the use of torture to police and the anti-narcotics </p><p>squad; said he believed ex-guerilla forces turned criminal </p><p>were responsible for the murder of AmCit Edward Todd Fields; </p><p>pledged to provide police protection requested by the </p><p>Forensic Anthropology Foundation; and promised to act on the </p><p>allegations of illegal entry and destruction of AmCit </p><p>property by squatters in Alta Verapaz.  We will continue to </p><p>monitor the progress of all these cases.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Torture Case </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) RefTel D reports the circumstances of a 179 kg. </p><p>seizure of cocaine and ephedrine (later confirmed as </p><p>caffeine) from a ranch in Rio Hondo, Zacapa province, as </p><p>reported to Embassy NAS by the Guatemalan Counter-Narcotics </p><p>Police (SAIA).  Ref C reports the Ambassador\'s warning to </p><p>President Portillo that information verified by MINUGUA </p><p>indicating the use of torture to extract information from </p><p>three of five trafficking suspects in this case was </p><p>unacceptable and could severely prejudice Guatemala\'s </p><p>prospects for counter-narcotics recertification.  Per RefTel </p><p>B, according to MINUGUA, the victims were tortured by persons </p><p>wearing National Civil Police and SAIA uniforms.  Unofficial </p><p>Embassy law enforcement contacts have told us that the </p><p>operation involved military operatives disguised as civilian </p><p>police.  Our sources allege that drugs were planted on the </p><p>three suspects before the larger seizure at the ranch, and </p><p>that the military reported only half the total seizure. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ambassador told Reyes Calderon that the use of </p><p>torture in this or any case is unacceptable.  He informed </p><p>Reyes Calderon of his earlier demarche to the President, and </p><p>warned that the violation of human rights in any </p><p>counter-narcotics cases would severely undermine any progress </p><p>toward recertification.  "We do not want to win the drug war </p><p>this way," he said.  Reyes Calderon acknowledged and agreed </p><p>with these concerns.  Reyes Calderon said that he had arrived </p><p>by helicopter on the scene after the arrests were made.  He </p><p>hinted that the military, not the policemen or SAIA agents </p><p>present, were responsible if any human rights violations were </p><p>committed in that operation, which he implied was organized </p><p>(rather than simply supported) by the military.  The </p><p>Ambassador asked if Reyes Calderon had spoken with Minister </p><p>of Defense Moran about his suspicions.  Reyes Calderon said </p><p>he had raised the case with Moran without making any </p><p>accusations, and had been told by Moran that the head of the </p><p>military intelligence unit (D-2) was being replaced </p><p>(presumably for complicity in this case).  The Ambassador </p><p>told Reyes Calderon that the Embassy is aware of the D-2 </p><p>chief\'s ouster and understands that his removal was for </p><p>reasons that predated this incident.  Reyes Calderon agreed </p><p>that any similar cases must be prevented, said he had made </p><p>Ministry policy against the use of torture abundantly clear </p><p>to his subordinates in the wake of this case, and said he </p><p>would raise this case in a Cabinet meeting later that day. </p><p> </p><p>AmCit Murder </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Ambassador also raised with Reyes Calderon the </p><p>brazen murder on March 28 of U.S. citizen Edward Todd Fields </p><p>on the main highway to a popular tourist destination, </p><p>reported in Ref A.  The Ambassador told Reyes Calderon that </p><p>the Embassy was considering advising all Americans to avoid </p><p>travel by road to Lake Atitlan.  He urged the minister to </p><p>make every effort to catch those responsible for this </p><p>outrageous crime, and pointed out that he passed by the same </p><p>route an hour before the victim, and saw only one police </p><p>cruiser on the road during his 100-mile trip on Guatemala\'s </p><p>principal highway.  Reyes Calderon said he believed that </p><p>members of the former guerrilla Organization of the People in </p><p>Arms (ORPA) to be responsible for the murder and said the </p><p>police will beef up patrols along the route immediately.  He </p><p>acknowledged the importance of this case and the vital </p><p>economic importance of security along major tourist routes. </p><p>(Comment:  It is not clear why Reyes blamed ex-ORPA members </p><p>for the killing, other than to give the impression that the </p><p>government had some leads.  In a meeting the next day, </p><p>National Police (PNC) Director Manchame also said the police </p><p>suspect ex-ORPA elements.  End Comment.) </p><p>FAFG Threats </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Ambassador then raised the case of recent </p><p>threats against family members of workers at the Forensic </p><p>Anthropology Institute (FAFG), the USAID-contracted NGO </p><p>performing exhumations of massacres during the internal </p><p>conflict.  Reyes Calderon said he was familiar with the </p><p>group, its prior experience receiving threats, and the </p><p>ministry\'s provision of special protection, voluntarily </p><p>relinquished by FAFG after a period of concern in 2002.  The </p><p>Ambassador provided Reyes Calderon with a request from FAFG </p><p>for police security for five homes and the assignment of </p><p>security agents to three individuals, including FAFG Director </p><p>Fredy Peccerelli and his sister Bianka, who was recently </p><p>accosted by armed men.  Reyes Calderon reviewed the list and </p><p>agreed to provide the protection requested. </p><p> </p><p>Alta Verapaz Land Dispute </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Finally, the Ambassador raised the troubling case </p><p>of the Ardebol family, U.S. citizens of Spanish origin whose </p><p>ranches have been occupied by landless peasants in Alta </p><p>Verapaz.  Carlos Ardebol, the owner of a ranch located in </p><p>Coban district, has for several weeks been prevented by </p><p>squatters from entering his home at the "Esmeralda" ranch for </p><p>fear of attack by the squatters.  Ardebol, who has been in </p><p>touch with the Embassy and GOG authorities about the land </p><p>occupation, has relocated his family to the capital, but </p><p>recently learned that squatters organized by the National </p><p>Coordination of Campesino Organizations (CONIC) have </p><p>destroyed personal property left behind.  The Ambassador told </p><p>Reyes Calderon that Mr. Ardebol was willing to engage in </p><p>dialogue with the squatters and their representatives.  The </p><p>recent criminal destruction of property, which Ardebol has </p><p>denounced to legal authorities, violates the law and the </p><p>spirit of dialogue to which he had been committed.  Reyes </p><p>Calderon said that police action in this case would be prompt </p><p>if sanctioned by legal authorities. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Reyes Calderon appeared nervous during this meeting </p><p>requested by the Ambassador, and was quick to agree to all </p><p>the Ambassador\'s requests.  The Ambassador has scheduled a </p><p>meeting with Minister of Defense Moran to repeat our concerns </p><p>about the alleged use of torture in counter-narcotics </p><p>operations.  MINUGUA has told us it will decide when to go </p><p>public with its findings sometime this week.  We will </p><p>continue to follow GOG action on these cases closely. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
