<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST AND IRAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- The lead story in all Jordanian dailies today, June </p><p>16, is the ongoing trial of two high-level officials </p><p>of the General Intelligence Department in a banking </p><p>fraud case.  Another prominent story in the papers is </p><p>the government\'s preparations for the parliamentary </p><p>elections scheduled for tomorrow, June 17.  Reports on </p><p>developments between the Palestinians and the </p><p>Israelis, as well as developments in Iraq and </p><p>continued confrontations between the Iraqi resistance </p><p>and the allied troops continue to receive front page </p><p>attention. </p><p> </p><p>          Editorial Commentary on Middle East </p><p> </p><p>-- "Sharon\'s moderation and the [US] administration\'s </p><p>extremism" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Tarek Masarweh writes on the back page </p><p>of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(06/16):  "The American position went back to its </p><p>condemnation of the Palestinians.  In return, Sharon </p><p>began playing the role of the moderate, acknowledging </p><p>the occupation of Nablus, Jenin, Hebron and other </p><p>major Palestinian cities, accepting the Palestinian </p><p>state, and offering a truce and a withdrawal..  Since </p><p>there are, in Sharon\'s cabinet and within the Israeli </p><p>ruling party, those who call for expelling the </p><p>Palestinians and for violence against and death for </p><p>the Arabs, then why should not Palestine have Hamas, </p><p>Jihad and the PFLP?  We have to remember that </p><p>Washington, which turned the legitimate Palestinian </p><p>opposition into terrorist organizations, has also </p><p>cancelled all the symbols of the Palestinian Authority </p><p>and agreed that its elected president be placed under </p><p>siege.  What does it mean to label both the opposition </p><p>and the Authority as terrorists?  How do they expect </p><p>the Palestinians to accept political solutions under </p><p>these circumstances?  Is not rejecting the regime and </p><p>the opposition together a denial of the Palestinian </p><p>entity in its entirety?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Sharon asks for a truce" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Yaser Za\'atreh writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Dustour (06/16):  "Sharon asks for a truce with Hamas. </p><p>Who would believe that this terrible `bulldozer\' would </p><p>finally go down on his knees and ask for a truce..  In </p><p>light of this, we must wonder: when the resistance </p><p>movement is achieving all this and forcing the </p><p>occupiers to retreat while it suffers from the lack of </p><p>Palestinian consensus, why not support it fully so </p><p>that it might force the enemy to retreat even more?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Success in wars does not make peace" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(06/15):  "The U.S. administration proved that it is </p><p>the `mother of warriors\'.  From its war on </p><p>Afghanistan, through its war on Iraq, and now its war </p><p>on the Hamas movement in Palestine, there lies a </p><p>common denominator, namely the capability of President </p><p>Bush to start wars and militarily win them.  On the </p><p>ground, however, the situation does not change much. </p><p>America\'s military victories against the Taliban in </p><p>Afghanistan and against Saddam Hussein in Iraq were </p><p>not coupled with political victory.  In other words, </p><p>the Americans\' capability to make wars is paralleled </p><p>by drastic failure in making peace..  The problem with </p><p>the U.S. policy is that it functions with the </p><p>mentality of `those who are not with us are against </p><p>us\'.  This is an approach that justifies war but does </p><p>not make peace.  Peace is established among enemies </p><p>and not among parties of the same alliance.  That is </p><p>why the American war in Afghanistan failed to make </p><p>peace there and the tribal wars have only ended in the </p><p>American media.  The same thing in Iraq.  America\'s </p><p>weapons of mass destruction removed Saddam Hussein, </p><p>but they failed in restoring Iraq as a stable and safe </p><p>home for its people.  As for the escalating peace </p><p>crisis in the Middle East, Bush and his administration </p><p>have already taken sides with Israel and its extremist </p><p>security theory.  That is why the roadmap, under </p><p>America\'s concept of implementation, has generated a </p><p>war on Hamas and Jihad.  Tomorrow, we may see the </p><p>American marines in the service of Sharon\'s military </p><p>campaigns. </p><p> </p><p>             Editorial Commentary on Iran </p><p> </p><p>-- "Iran\'s demonstrations are not a foreign </p><p>conspiracy" </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/16):  "The leadership in Iran may claim an </p><p>American conspiracy that is instigating Iranian </p><p>college students to protest against the symbols and </p><p>philosophy of the Republic and to call for liberal </p><p>reforms.  This is because all countries of the third </p><p>world have become accustomed to ascribing their </p><p>internal problems to the presence of a foreign </p><p>conspiracy instead of acknowledging the root causes of </p><p>these problems and finding logical solutions for them. </p><p>However, Arab politicians and analysts have no right </p><p>to mislead the Arab public by adopting this analysis </p><p>and justification just to spite the United States. </p><p>The truth that must be acknowledged is that the </p><p>demonstrations of the liberal students in Iran have </p><p>political, social and cultural justifications that </p><p>stem from the Iranian status quo.  Whoever wants to </p><p>ignore this would commit the same sin of having </p><p>ignored the internal contradictions in Iraq and </p><p>blaming the United States." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
