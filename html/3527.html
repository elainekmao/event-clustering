<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001605 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND SA/PD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MCAP, MOPS, PTER, SCUL, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL ARMY HOLDS MAIDEN PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  In an apparent effort to burnish its public image </p><p>and promote public confidence that it is gaining ground </p><p>against Maoist insurgents, the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) held </p><p>its first-ever press conference in Kathmandu August 15. </p><p>Speaking to reporters, Col. Deepak Gurung, head of the RNA\'s </p><p>Public Affairs office, said RNA successes had crippled the </p><p>Maoists\' command-and-control network, seriously impaired </p><p>their mobility in the field, undermined their logistics, </p><p>demoralized their cadre, and induced surrenders in </p><p>ever-increasing numbers.  Gurung reported RNA statistics of </p><p>2,290 insurgents confirmed killed in action; 300 insurgents </p><p>wounded; 163 RNA killed in action; 235 soldiers wounded; 536 </p><p>policemen killed; 667 civilians killed; and a recovery rate </p><p>of weapons looted of an unimipressive 13 percent.  The RNA </p><p>estimates current Maoist strength at 3000-4000 hard-core </p><p>cadre, complemented by 10,000-15,000 militia members.  The </p><p>RNA, on the other hand, has bolstered its 50,000-man troop </p><p>strength by an additional 5000 new recruits, with another </p><p>5000 expected during the new fiscal year.  To provide </p><p>additional security for sensitive infrastructure and for the </p><p>November 13 national elections, Gurung announced RNA plans to </p><p>hire 10,000 retired soldiers on contract.  Anticipated </p><p>military assistance from foreign donors--Gurung specifically </p><p>cited the U.S., U.K., India, and China--will augment RNA </p><p>capabilities. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The press conference follows closely on yet another </p><p>RNA first--an Army-hosted tour of conflict areas in Rukum and </p><p>Rolpa for 20 Nepali journalists on July 19.  (Note:  The RNA </p><p>took seven members of the foreign press corps and one </p><p>representative of the national news service on a tour of </p><p>sites in Rolpa and Western Division Headquarters in Nepalganj </p><p>May 10-11.  End note.)  Although the journalists had no </p><p>opportunity to interview local villagers independently and </p><p>were accompanied by RNA hosts throughout their visit, many </p><p>said they found the event useful and informative.  Press </p><p>coverage of the tour was largely favorable. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment:  The press conference is remarkable not </p><p>so much for its content--most of what Gurung briefed had </p><p>appeared in the press before--but for the fact that it </p><p>occurred at all.  The Embassy and DATT have been encouraging </p><p>the RNA to be more forthcoming with the press, noting the </p><p>media\'s potential as a powerful ally in publicizing Maoist </p><p>excesses and violence, but encountered considerable </p><p>institutional resistance from the Army\'s traditionally </p><p>close-mouthed hierarchy.  Col. Gurung told emboff he had </p><p>considered holding a press conference much earlier, but had </p><p>found his plans repeatedly frustrated by bureaucratic </p><p>inertia.  The Colonel credited his July 1-19 visit to the </p><p>U.S. on an International Visitor Program for government </p><p>spokesmen with inspiring him to carry through with his </p><p>original plans.  Specifically, he cited visits to the Public </p><p>Affairs bureaus at the Department of State and Pentagon, </p><p>including attendance at a press briefing given by A/S </p><p>Boucher, as events that "gave me the confidence that I could </p><p>do this."  Given the prominent coverage Gurung\'s briefing </p><p>garnered in most major newspapers, we hope the RNA will </p><p>follow up this first effort with similar, regularly scheduled </p><p>events in the future. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
