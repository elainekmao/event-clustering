<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002480 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS TO USTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, OVIP, NI, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. MOVE TOWARD AFRICAN WTO POSITIONS APPLAUDED </p><p>AT OAU TRADE MINISTERIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 160506 B) STATE 161354 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive But Unclassified, Please Handle Accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Fourth Organization of African </p><p>Unity/African Economic Community Conference of Trade </p><p>Ministers September 22-23 in Abuja, Nigeria ended with </p><p>widespread appreciation for U.S. movement toward African WTO </p><p>positions on agriculture, intellectual property, the </p><p>environment, labor issues, and special and differential </p><p>treatment (as outlined in reftel A).  While the conference </p><p>could not issue a final report (as much for logistical </p><p>reasons as substantive ones), all countries -- even those </p><p>which have traditionally opposed the U.S. at the WTO -- </p><p>recognized how far the U.S. has come and that there now </p><p>exists a firm basis to bridge the remaining differences and </p><p>launch a new round.  On the bilateral U.S.-Nigeria front, </p><p>AUSTR Whitaker met with National Assembly members on the WTO, </p><p>received support from the Vice President and Minister of </p><p>Commerce for a new WTO round, and got new promises that </p><p>bureaucratic problems that have to date prevented an </p><p>AGOA-compatible visa system for apparel exports would soon be </p><p>resolved.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>At the OAU Ministerial Conference </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Working through OAU Economic Office Director Fred </p><p>Alipui, Post assisted Ms. Whitaker in scheduling her remarks </p><p>during the trade ministerial opening plenary session </p><p>(immediately prior to those by Nigerian President Olusegun </p><p>Obasanjo) and in distributing extensive USG WTO talking </p><p>points in English and French to all delegations. </p><p>3. (U) Mike Moore, Director General of the World Trade </p><p>Organization, gave a ten-minute presentation in which he </p><p>challenged the African nations to become more involved in the </p><p>global trading system and promised that, under his </p><p>administration, Africa would be a primary focus of WTO </p><p>activities.  Likewise, AUSTR Whitaker,s remarks encouraged </p><p>African nations, as a substantial voting block, to take a </p><p>leadership role in setting the WTO agenda.  She also outlined </p><p>U.S. movement toward African positions on WTO issues. </p><p>Whitaker reviewed tangible results of the first year since </p><p>passage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act.  Contacts </p><p>at the OAU and several delegates favorably contrasted the </p><p>prominent placement of AUSTR Whitaker,s remarks in the </p><p>opening ceremony and the extensive dissemination of the U.S. </p><p>position papers with the rather pro forma participation by </p><p>the European Union.  The EU was represented by their </p><p>Abuja-resident Ambassador who read two pages of talking </p><p>points during a lightly-attended afternoon session. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) At the margins of the two-day ministerial, Ms. </p><p>Whitaker and Mr. Moore held consultations with Trade </p><p>Ministers and their delegations from Uganda, Kenya, </p><p>Mozambique, Ethiopia, Senegal, Gabon, Benin, Botswana, </p><p>Angola, Guinea Conakry, and South Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Ugandan Trade Minister told AUSTR Whitaker that </p><p>President Musaveni is recalling his Ambassador from Geneva </p><p>and replacing him with one who will reflect shared African </p><p>and U.S. objectives in the WTO.   Nigerian Trade Minister </p><p>Mustapha Bello, Economic Community of West African States </p><p>(ECOWAS) Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate, and Assistant </p><p>Secretary General of the OAU Ambassador Lawrence O.C. Agubuzu </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>all commented on the growing support within the OAU and </p><p>ECOWAS for a new round, and voiced appreciation to Whitaker </p><p>for the changes in the USG position. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Nigerian logistical support, notably translation and </p><p>interpretation services, was poor and impacted the progress </p><p>of events.  The early departure of Trade Ministers who would </p><p>not delegate authority to subordinates and a few hardline </p><p>hold outs on the issue of  "consensus" for a new round, meant </p><p>that the final report was tabled until a special OAU Trade </p><p>Ministers, caucus to be held before Doha. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Business Outside the Ministerial Conference </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) First in a meeting with National Assembly Speaker </p><p>Ghali Na,abba and later in a lunch with the Chairs of the </p><p>House and Senate Commerce Committees, Whitaker encouraged the </p><p>Nigerian National Assembly to play a more proactive role in </p><p>setting the nation\'s trade policy agenda within both the WTO </p><p>and on AGOA.  Whitaker showed the Chairmen  Nigerian press </p><p>reports that members of the National Assembly were advocating </p><p>Nigeria\'s withdrawal from the WTO.  The legislators seemed </p><p>surprised by the tone of the press reports, claiming that </p><p>they had not, in fact, advocated such a position.  The </p><p>Chairman did, however, express concern over Nigeria\'s </p><p>obligations in the WTO.  Whitaker replied that African </p><p>nations, as a significant voting block within the WTO, stood </p><p>to gain from a new round at which Africans could voice their </p><p>concerns and play a leadership role in setting the agenda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In a separate meeting, ECOWAS Executive Secretary </p><p>Kouyate said that all, even the most recalcitrant ECOWAS </p><p>states, now see globalization as inevitable.  Kouyate had </p><p>just returned from Botswana where he obtained USD 2 million </p><p>for training of ECOWAS member state officials in trade </p><p>issues, and was applying for further support from other </p><p>organizations including the regional USAID office in Bamako. </p><p>Though Kouyate only has three months left in his tenure, he </p><p>expected to leave ECOWAS with his program well established. </p><p>Each of the fifteen member states will specialize in some </p><p>area of trade in goods and services, and will be able to </p><p>represent the sub-region in a professional manner that was </p><p>not possible before. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Vice President and Commerce Minister Address WTO and AGOA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) AUSTR Whitaker, Moore and Poloff made a series of </p><p>calls on high-level Nigerian officials, including Vice </p><p>President Atiku Abubakar and Minister of Commerce Mustapha </p><p>Bello.  Abubakar received with grace AUSTR Whitaker,s thank </p><p>you for Nigerian leadership in calling for a new WTO round, </p><p>but seemed more interested in AGOA issues.  He agreed to </p><p>intervene as necessary in resolving problems with Nigerian </p><p>Customs in ensuring inspections by U.S. customs officers to </p><p>prevent transshipment as part of the apparel visa program. </p><p>He also asked if the U.S. could involve more states in the </p><p>gum arabic program.  (President Obasanjo had also asked to </p><p>ensure that Yobe State would be made a full participant.) </p><p>Whitaker explained that the U.S. private sector, working with </p><p>USAID, had chosen Jigawa State as a pilot project where U.S. </p><p>contractors would work with the State government on </p><p>establishing a quality-control laboratory that would meet </p><p>U.S. import requirements.  She emphasized that the laboratory </p><p>would be able to evaluate gum arabic originating anywhere in </p><p>Nigeria, cautioning against other states setting up </p><p>laboratories that might not meet U.S. standards.  Whitaker </p><p>predicted that efforts to diversify gum arabic supplies away </p><p>from Sudan would increase, and that U.S. demand would be high </p><p>enough to support gum arabic growers in many Nigerian States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Minister of Commerce Mustapha Bello, host of the </p><p>OAU Ministerial, was pleased to hear that an earlier proposal </p><p>to sell Nigerian yarn to South Africa for apparel production </p><p>would be allowed under AGOA, and would require only a </p><p>certificate of origin.  Bello also brought up demands from </p><p>Nigerian States, particularly Yobe, for greater participation </p><p>in the gum arabic project.  Bello believed that the majority </p><p>of African states were behind a new round, but that the few </p><p>hardliners might preclude the consensus normally required for </p><p>the OAU to take a position.  Both in the private meeting and </p><p>in the press opportunity that followed, Bello complimented </p><p>USTR Zoellick for his leadership in moving U.S. WTO positions </p><p>and expressed an interest in meeting the new USTR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Press coverage of the visit was extensive and </p><p>included the speech at the plenary session, calls on the </p><p>Speaker of the House and Minister of Commerce and the </p><p>departure press conference attended by 22 journalists at the </p><p>Lagos international airport on May 25.  Coverage will be </p><p>reported septel as a part of PAS regular placement reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) AUSTR Whitaker did not have an opportunity to clear </p><p>this message before departing Nigeria. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
