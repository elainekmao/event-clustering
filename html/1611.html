IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01168  291404Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON MARCH 28, POLOFF OBTAINED A READOUT ON DRC </p><p>PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA\'S TWO-DAY VISIT TO HARARE FROM </p><p>THE MFA\'S PRINCIPAL ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER (PAO) ON THE </p><p>DRC, MAXWELL CHIKOROWONDO.  REGARDING KABILA\'S ADDRESS </p><p>TO PARLIAMENT (REFTEL), THE PAO NOTED THAT KABILA IS </p><p>"PREPARED TO GO THE FULL MILE FOR PEACE" IN THE DRC, BUT </p><p>CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT THE "AGGRESSOR STATES" WITHDRAW </p><p>FROM DRC TERRITORY BEFORE THE ALLIES DO.  HE ALSO NOTED </p><p>KABILA\'S STATEMENT THAT SADC\'S DECISION TO SEND TROOPS </p><p>TO THE DRC WAS A UNANIMOUS ONE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CHIKOROWONDO REPORTED THAT KABILA HELD A "LONG" </p><p>ONE-ON-ONE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, BUT THAT HE </p><p>WAS NOT PRIVY TO WHAT WAS DISCUSSED.  KABILA ALSO MET </p><p>WITH TRANSPORT MINISTER SWITHUN MOMBESHORA AND LANDS AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER JOSEPH MADE (BUT NOT THE FULL </p><p>CABINET) TO DISCUSS "BILATERAL ISSUES IN THEIR </p><p>RESPECTIVE FIELDS."  KABILA HELD A BREAKFAST MEETING </p><p>WITH "NEARLY EVERY PROMINENT ZIMBABWEAN BUSINESSMAN," </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MFA OFFICIAL.  KABILA REPORTEDLY </p><p>ENCOURAGED ZIMBABWEAN INDUSTRY TO INCREASE ITS ALREADY </p><p>SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE DRC AND DISCUSSED WAYS IN </p><p>WHICH IT COULD HAPPEN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) POLOFF ASKED CHIKOROWONDO TO COMMENT ON THE </p><p>PRESS ITEM QUOTING A MONUC REPORT THAT STATED THE ALLIED </p><p>FORCES HAD NOT BEGUN TO WITHDRAW FROM THE DRC FRONTLINES </p><p>AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO.  CHIKOROWONDO STATED THAT THE </p><p>MONUC REPORT IN QUESTION WAS FROM THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF </p><p>THE DISENGAGEMENT PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN MID-MARCH.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01168  291404Z </p><p>REPORT HAS SINCE BEEN OVERTAKEN BY EVENTS AS THE ALLIED </p><p>FORCES ARE WITHDRAWING ON SCHEDULE, AND WILL COMPLETE </p><p>THEIR 15 KM PULLBACK IN KATANGA BY THE MARCH 29 </p><p>DEADLINE, THE PAO ASSERTED.  HE ALSO REMARKED THAT </p><p>INITIALLY THERE HAD BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF FORCES FROM PWETO, BUT THAT HAS SINCE BEEN </p><p>RESOLVED.  MONUC HAS YET TO CONFIRM THE PULLBACK OF </p><p>BEMBA\'S FORCES IN EQUATEUR, PROBABLY BECAUSE BEMBA HAS </p><p>NOT YET GIVEN THE ORDER TO WITHDRAW, CHIKOROWONDO ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: KABILA\'S VISIT TO ZIMBABWE APPEARED TO </p><p>HAVE HAD THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES: 1) TO THANK ZIMBABWE FOR </p><p>ITS INTERVENTION IN THE DRC, 2) TO ASSUAGE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT ITS CONTINUED PARTICIPATION, AND MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT, 3) TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC LINKAGES BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO COUNTRIES.  IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT KABILA WOULD </p><p>SPEND A LARGE BLOCK OF HIS LIMITED TIME HERE CONSULTING </p><p>WITH MINISTERS WITH EXTRACTIVE-SECTOR PORTFOLIOS AND THE </p><p>INDIGENOUS BUSINESS COMMUNITY.  ACCORDING TO OUR </p><p>CONTACTS, THE CEO OF METROPOLITAN BANK, WHO IS ALSO A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE INDIGENOUS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION, HOSTED </p><p>THE BREAKFAST MEETING.  IT INVOLVED ONLY MEMBERS WITH </p><p>STRONG TIES TO ZANU-PF, AND NO MEMBERS OF THE WHITE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY ATTENDED.  THESE MEETINGS, COUPLED </p><p>WITH THE OVER-THE-TOP RECEPTION OF PRESIDENT KABILA BY </p><p>PUTTING HIM ON THE SAME PLANE AS NELSON MANDELA, </p><p>UNDERSCORE THE GOZ\'S MAIN PURPOSE FOR ITS COSTLY </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE DRC.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01168  291404Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
