<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002056 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: LEYLA ZANA RETRIAL OPENS; COURT DENIES RELEASE </p><p>REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1578 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1362 </p><p>     C. 02 ANKARA 8881 </p><p>     D. 02 ANKARA 6116 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. Kass. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The historic retrial of Leyla Zana and three </p><p>other Kurdish former M.P.s began March 28 under tight </p><p>security.  The court ruled against releasing the defendants </p><p>pending the outcome of the trial and rejected a defense </p><p>petition seeking a new chief judge.  Turkish and </p><p>international human rights advocates and foreign diplomats </p><p>attended the packed hearing.  The next session will be held </p><p>April 25.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Packed Hearing </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The retrial of Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan, </p><p>and Selim Sadak -- former Members of Parliament from the </p><p>pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP -- since banned) -- began </p><p>under tight security March 28 in an Ankara State Security </p><p>Court.  The retrial is the first granted under a recent </p><p>EU-related reform measure allowing for retrial in a Turkish </p><p>court pursuant to rulings of the European Court of Human </p><p>Rights (ECHR -reftel B).  The former M.P.s were convicted, in </p><p>a controversial 1994 trial, of membership in an illegal </p><p>organization (the PKK). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The courtroom was filled to capacity; in addition to </p><p>two Emboffs, the audience included: numerous relatives of the </p><p>defendants; Turkish and international Kurdish/human rights </p><p>advocates; diplomats from Germany, Denmark, and the EU; and </p><p>the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Parliamentary Human </p><p>Rights Committee.  Lead defense attorney Yusuf Alatas told </p><p>Poloff more than 300 attorneys had asked to participate in </p><p>the case, but he accepted only 25 in order to reduce tensions </p><p>in the courtroom and allow more space for observers.  (Note: </p><p>High-profile cases in Turkey often include 100 or more </p><p>lawyers, though all but a few are glorified spectators.  End </p><p>Note.)  There was a heavy police and military presence inside </p><p>and outside the courtroom, but no visible tensions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Ruling: Defendants Stay Behind Bars </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The three-judge court ruled unanimously against a </p><p>motion asking that the defendants be released pending the </p><p>outcome of the trial.  The court also unanimously rejected </p><p>defense petitions asking for the replacement of the court\'s </p><p>Chief Judge on the grounds that he had voted against granting </p><p>the retrial and was therefore not impartial.  All four </p><p>defendants gave lengthy opening statements.  Dicle argued </p><p>that the remarks for which he was convicted had subsequently </p><p>been mirrored in comments by State officials -- and thus </p><p>decriminalized --  during his incarceration.  "We have </p><p>already been in jail longer than any political prisoners in </p><p>Turkish history," Dicle charged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The court set April 25 as the date of the next </p><p>hearing.  It also ordered that travel funds be made available </p><p>to enable out-of-town witnesses to attend, and that civil </p><p>servant witnesses be excused from work in order to testify. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) This trial will be closely watched -- particularly by </p><p>EU observers looking to test the sincerity of GOT human </p><p>rights reforms.  The court\'s refusal to release the </p><p>defendants or appoint a new chief judge does not bode well </p><p>for an acquittal.  At the same time, the GOT is reeling from </p><p>the recent ECHR ruling that jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan </p><p>did not receive a fair trial (Reftel A), and is under </p><p>pressure to be on its best behavior in this case.  At a time </p><p>when Turkey appears to be alienating its foreign friends left </p><p>and right, the GOT can ill afford a perception of juridical </p><p>legerdemain. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
