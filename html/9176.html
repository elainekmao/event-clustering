SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) MDC Delegations </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>(C) MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai outlined for the </p><p>Ambassador his party\'s plans for upcoming meetings and </p><p>various mediation efforts underway. Tsvangirai said that the </p><p>MDC would be sending a small team to Pretoria next week </p><p>headed by spokesman Paul Themba Nyati to manage the press. </p><p>In addition, a political delegation headed by Deputy SecGen </p><p>Gift Chamanikire and including David Coltart, Sekai Holland </p><p>and Moses Ndlovu would travel to Pretoria and Maputo.  He </p><p>reiterated the request that they be received by someone on </p><p>the delegation.  When the Ambassador suggested that this </p><p>would be difficult, he indicated that even a meeting with a </p><p>junior member of the delegation would be helpful.  Tsvangirai </p><p>apologized for the MDC having stated publicly its intent to </p><p>meet with the US delegation and recognized that this made </p><p>things more difficult.  He also wanted to be sure that last </p><p>Saturday\'s New York Times description of his reaction to US </p><p>public statements had not been misunderstood.  Tsvangirai </p><p>said he welcomed US public statements and had only sought to </p><p>avoid conveying any impression that the MDC was orchestrating </p><p>US pressure. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) No Real Talks underway </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(C) Tsvangirai sought to set the record straight about what </p><p>mediation efforts are underway and to underline that no </p><p>genuine substantive dialogue is ongoing between the political </p><p>parties, notwithstanding suggestions by President Mbeki to </p><p>the contrary.  He was most worried that the US not be </p><p>deflected from pressing for genuine dialogue by "idle </p><p>reassurances" from the South Africans that meaningful </p><p>dialogue is ongoing.  Tsvangirai said that, while periodic </p><p>conversations take place between the South African High </p><p>Commission and the MDC, no specific proposals have been put </p><p>on the table and no ZANU-PF agreement to dialogue has been </p><p>conveyed to the MDC.  He said that neither have there been </p><p>substantive telephone discussions which could pass for </p><p>negotiations nor any South African emissaries with the </p><p>exception of a South African Deputy Director of Intelligence </p><p>who visited and met with the MDC over two months ago. </p><p>Tsvangirai expressed concern that the effect of repeated </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>South African statements that dialogue is ongoing and that </p><p>the solution must come from inside Zimbabwe has been to give </p><p>cover to Mugabe\'s stalling and unwillingness or inability to </p><p>confront ZANU-PF\'s own succession crisis. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Several Church efforts </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(C) Tsvangirai said that he had discouraged further efforts </p><p>by Father Fidelis to broker a meeting between Mugabe and him </p><p>because "this would not be meaningful after the man has </p><p>thrown me in jail."  With a bit of prodding, Tsvangirai </p><p>allowed that he would not reject such a summit meeting if it </p><p>was accompanied by a substantive ZANU-PF  commitment to </p><p>serious negotiations.  Tsvangirai said that the Zimbabwean </p><p>ecumenical Church delegation had held a second round of </p><p>separate talks with the MDC and a ZANU delegation including </p><p>Party Chairman John Nkomo and Information Secretary Nathan </p><p>Shamuyarira.  To try to move these mediation efforts to </p><p>substance, the MDC had proposed that the agenda for dialogue </p><p>between MDC and ZANU be the same as that agreed between the </p><p>parties in May 2002 before Mugabe scuttled those talks. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) ZANU-PF and CIO Contacts with MDC </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>Tsvangirai said that Justice Minister Chinamasa was </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>maintaining periodic talks with MDC SecGen Welshman Ncube </p><p>over ways of the two sides agreeing on a revised </p><p>constitution.  Tsvangirai said it was unclear with what </p><p>status Chinamasa was carrying out these talks and the MDC </p><p>would in any case insist that basic agreements on a return to </p><p>the rule of law and legitimacy and a transitional arrangement </p><p>would have to accompany a constitutional revision process. </p><p>Tsvangirai also said that the CIO had recently renewed </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>contact with the party, but that it was not possible to </p><p>determine with what status or purpose. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) What MDC Expects Out of Dialogue </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>(C) Tsvangirai said that any serious dialogue had to address </p><p>several key issues: the immediate return to a rule of law, </p><p>including dismantlement of youth militia; a discussion of </p><p>serious issues, including the nature and length of a </p><p>transitional arrangement; commitment to relatively early </p><p>elections under revised free and fair procedures; and, most </p><p>critically,  Mugabe\'s exit. Tsvangirai said that the MDC was </p><p>debating how long a transition period should be and </p><p>Tsvangirai stated his preference for not more than a year. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>But he thought that the length of a transition should be </p><p>dictated by the extent of commitment to serious reforms </p><p>during a transitional period. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A Retrospective on Mass Action </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(C)  While underlining the success of the stayaway, </p><p>Tsvangirai recognized the downsides of not having produced </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the mass demonstrations promised.  He appeared reconciled to </p><p>a more patient path and more training and organization of </p><p>cadres in non-violence and other key areas. </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) His request of the US </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(c) Tsvangirai asked that we press the South Africans for </p><p>concrete results from their effort to foster dialogue, </p><p>including a fixed timetable of three or so months and a </p><p>designated result; i.e. Mugabe\'s exit and a transitional </p><p>government. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
