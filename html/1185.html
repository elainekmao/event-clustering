<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001937 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, EINT, ETRD, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: THE NETHERLANDS: EU DIGITAL SIGNATURE DIRECTIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 84614 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  Emboff met with Ministry of Economic Affairs </p><p>official Martin Buys to discuss Dutch implementation of the </p><p>directive.  The GON is drafting legislation, therefore no </p><p>public version is available.  Buys said that the GON wishes </p><p>to limit government involvement in electronic signatures, </p><p>allowing market forces to be the largest determinant. End </p><p>summary.  Responses follow in the same order as the questions </p><p>in paragraph 9 of Reftel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The GON is drafting legislation, therefore no public </p><p>version is available.  Principle drafters include a judicial </p><p>advisory board, the Council of State (Raad van State), the </p><p>Ministry of Transportation, Public Works and Water </p><p>Management, and the Ministry of Justice.  The main concern of </p><p>the Ministry of Transport (which deals with </p><p>telecommunication) is the implementation of Article 3(3). </p><p>This article requires member states to establish a system for </p><p>supervision of certification-service-providers.  According to </p><p>Buys, the GON finds it difficult to implement Article 3(3) </p><p>because Article 3(1) states that provision of certification </p><p>services requires proper authorization.  The GON is unsure of </p><p>its legal authority, therefore it is attempting to implement </p><p>Article 3(3) on a lower level, only requiring supervision of </p><p>certification-service-providers offering advanced digital </p><p>signatures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The Ministry of Justice is working to implement Article </p><p>5(1), concerning the legality of electronic signatures. </p><p>Digital signatures are already admissible in Dutch courts, </p><p>due to previous legislation and what the Dutch term "freedom </p><p>of evidence," giving wide scope to what is admissible in a </p><p>court of law.  The GON is more concerned with making digital </p><p>signatures legally equal to handwritten signatures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Recital 16 sets forth basic guidelines for the regulatory </p><p>framework needed on intranet and internet.  In the </p><p>Netherlands, the discussion surrounding Recital 16 centers </p><p>around the ability of the GON to place higher standards on </p><p>government use than the directive requires. The GON </p><p>determined that the private sector may choose to go beyond </p><p>guidelines given in the directive, but that the government </p><p>should not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The Netherlands already has a voluntary non-licensing </p><p>scheme through Trusted Third Party Group, TTP, a nationally </p><p>operating IT service provider managed by the Dutch </p><p>association for electronic commerce, ECPN (Electronic </p><p>Commerce Platform Netherlands). This can be accessed via the </p><p>website ecp.nl. The GON is concerned with keeping </p><p>accreditation of certification-service-providers </p><p>market-based, and is attempting to limit government </p><p>involvement to the registration of certification service </p><p>providers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Article 9 committee members include Martin Buys, Ministry </p><p>of Economic Affairs, and Ronald van der Luit, Ministry of </p><p>Transportation, Public Works and Water Management. Buys said </p><p>that the meeting of the Article 9 Committee in March was </p><p>mostly "window dressing," and said that nothing substantive </p><p>was discussed.  The GON believes more important discussions </p><p>are taking place in the standards environment, particularly </p><p>EESSI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Buys said that at the initiative of the UK </p><p>representatives, representatives from Sweden, Germany, France </p><p>and the Netherlands have agreed to meet the evening before </p><p>the next Article 9 Committee meeting in June. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Most active participation in ETSI and CEN stems from </p><p>private companies involved in the standardization process. </p><p>Currently, advisory companies such as KPMG, Price </p><p>Waterhouse-Coopers and others are involved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. The GON is considering implementing internationally </p><p>recognized guidelines contained in Common Criteria (CC), </p><p>developed by the Information Security Systems Organization. </p><p>However, the GON is concerned with enforcement of Article </p><p>3(4).  The Article deals with the conformity of secure </p><p>signature-creation devices.  Buys said that the GON remains </p><p>uncertain regarding its ability to adequately address </p><p>enforcement on this issue because it requires enforcement on </p><p>a user-level. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TOKOLA </p><p></p></div>
