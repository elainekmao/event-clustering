<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: IZ, KPAO, PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR-GENERAL: THERE IS A </p><p>TERRORIST SUPPORTER WITHIN THE IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Action request at para 7. Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) SUMMARY. DCM met with Tahsin Burcuoglu </p><p>(Director-General for Middle East, OIC, and North Africa </p><p>Affairs at the MFA) on July 18 at the latter\'s request. </p><p>Burcuoglu passed the DCM a paper outlining the reasons why </p><p>the GOT believes Mahmoud Othman, who has recently been </p><p>appointed as a member of the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC), </p><p>has close links with the PKK/KADEK (full text of the paper is </p><p>at para 8). END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>MAHMOUD OTHMAN -- A TERRORIST WITHIN THE IGC? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) BACKGROUND: There have been numerous reports in the </p><p>days since the establishment of the IGC that one of its </p><p>members, Mahmoud Othman, is a member of the PKK/KADEK and the </p><p>PKK-fronted Kurdish Parliament in Exile. When asked about his </p><p>affiliations, he said to a Turkish newspaper that, as a Kurd, </p><p>he is a friend to all Kurds, including Turkey\'s Kurds, Media </p><p>TV, and the PKK. If the GOT sees its Kurds as terrorists, </p><p>than he is a terrorist. The Embassy has received calls from </p><p>the media on this issue and has been responding with USG </p><p>policy: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the US considers the PKK/KADEK to be a terrorist </p><p>organization; </p><p>-- we are working to ensure that Iraq is not a safehaven for </p><p>any terrorists; </p><p>-- we are working with the Turkish government to address the </p><p>issue of the PKK/KADEK presence in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BACKGROUND CONT: It is worth noting that the stories </p><p>about Othman were raised by a journalist from "Ulusal TV," </p><p>which with "Aydinlik" magazine is affiliated with the </p><p>left-wing nationalist Workers\' Party of Dogu Perincek -- a </p><p>noted conduit of material from the TGS and various other </p><p>elements of the Turkish "Deep State"/security organs. As </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever of "Hurriyet" explained to us privately on </p><p>July 16, the Perincek press ambush is typical of the wider </p><p>effort by defenders of a hard-line statist status quo to </p><p>deflect attention from Turkish impropriety in Iraq. END </p><p>BACKGROUND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) MFA Middle East Director-General Burcuoglu called in </p><p>the DCM on July 18 to pass a paper outlining the reasons why </p><p>the GOT believes Mahmoud Othman has close links with the </p><p>PKK/KADEK. Burcuoglu stressed that the GOT is very unhappy </p><p>with Othman\'s presence on the IGC. He also said that General </p><p>Ozkok would likely raise this issue with General Abizaid </p><p>during their meeting on July 18, as would FM Gul during his </p><p>upcoming trip to Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) The DCM told Burcuoglu that it was certainly never the </p><p>intention of the USG to put a PKK/KADEK sympathizer on the </p><p>IGC. However, the USG had found no link to the PKK/KADEK. </p><p>U.S. policy on terrorists is consistent. The USG would </p><p>welcome any additional information on Othman which the GOT </p><p>believes to be relevant. Burcuoglu responded that he would </p><p>ask that relevant information be shared with the USG through </p><p>other channels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Embassy Ankara requests that Washington provide </p><p>guidance ASAP regarding the allegations that Othman has close </p><p>links with the PKK/KADEK, so that we can effectively respond </p><p>to these allegations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>TEXT OF MFA PAPER ON OTHMAN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Begin text of paper: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Mahmoud Othman, who is appointed as a member of the Iraqi </p><p>Governing Council established on 13 July, 2003, is known to </p><p>have close relations with PKK/KADEK terrorist organization </p><p>and its leadership. </p><p>-- Previously, he had participated in the meetings of the </p><p>so-called "Kurdish Parliament in exile" and "Kurdistan </p><p>National Congress," which were set up on the initiative of </p><p>the PKK/KADEK terrorist organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- During the armed clashes between the Patriotic Union of </p><p>Kurdistan and PKK/KADEK terrorist organization in 2000 in </p><p>northern Iraq, he acted as a mediator upon the request of the </p><p>terrorist organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- He participated in several programmes of "Media TV," a TV </p><p>channel of the terrorist organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- He made several statements supporting and praising Ocalan, </p><p>leader of the PKK/KADEK terrorist organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In his statement reflected in today\'s Turkish press, he </p><p>explicitly reveals his close relationship with the terrorist </p><p>organization (..."I am a friend of KADEK"...) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- To have a person in the Iraqi Governing Council, declaring </p><p>his support for PKK/KADEK which is recognized as a terrorist </p><p>organization by the US, is regrettable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- This makes Mahmoud Othman\'s presence in the Iraqi </p><p>Governing Council improper and may curtail Turkey\'s effective </p><p>cooperation with the Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- We expect the US to take appropriate action in this </p><p>respect. END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
