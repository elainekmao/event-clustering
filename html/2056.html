THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" </p><p>   DEDICATED ITS OCTOBER 11 EDITORIAL TO THE U.S.-LED </p><p>   MILITARY STRIKES ON TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN </p><p>   AFGHANISTAN.  UNDER HEADLINE "WAR AND PEACE," THE PAPER </p><p>   COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "UNITED STATES AND BRITISH AIR STRIKES AGAINST </p><p>   TARGETS IN AFGHANISTAN, REGRETTABLE AS THEY ARE TO </p><p>   THOSE WHO NEVER WANT WAR, WERE INEVITABLE IF ONLY TO </p><p>   SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL TO THE TALIBAN AND ITS ADOPTED SON </p><p>   OSAMA BIN LADEN THAT TERRORISM CANNOT AND MUST NEVER </p><p>   PREVAIL.  INDEED BIN LADEN\'S THREAT THIS WEEK TO </p><p>   UNLEASH MORE TERROR AGAINST THE U. S. IN THE AFTERMATH </p><p>   OF THE STRIKES THAT ONLY TARGET MILITARY INSTALLATIONS </p><p>   AND TERROR BASES IN AFGHANISTAN MAKES IT MORE URGENT </p><p>   AND IMPERATIVE THAN EVER BEFORE THAT ALL POSSIBLE </p><p>   MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO CRUSH THE SCOURGE THAT THREATENS </p><p>   ALL HUMANITY.  LET IT BE NOTED THAT AFGHANISTAN\'S </p><p>   RUTHLESS RULERS - THEY HAVE PUSHED THE COUNTRY BACK </p><p>   INTO THE STONE AGE THROUGH UNPRECEDENTED REPRESSION - </p><p>   WERE GIVEN MORE THAN AMPLE TIME NOT ONLY TO SHUT BIN </p><p>   LADEN\'S TERRORIST CAMPS BUT TO ACT AGAINST HIM, BUT </p><p>   THEY PREDICTABLY REFUSED.  THE MILITARY BLITZ THAT IS </p><p>   NOW IN PROGRESS IS NOT BECAUSE WASHINGTON AND LONDON </p><p>   CHOSE WAR BUT THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ACT IN SELF </p><p>   DEFENSE, TO PRESERVE PEACE AND TO BRING THOSE BEHIND </p><p>   THE GHASTLY SEPTEMBER 11 SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENTS TO </p><p>   BOOK.  THE U. S. IS ALSO RIGHT TO PRESS AHEAD WITH </p><p>   INTENSE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS AND A FINANCIAL SQUEEZE ON </p><p>   THE TERRORISTS WHO, BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION THIS WEEK, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03047  121035Z </p><p>   MASTERMINDED THE MINDLESS MASSACRE OF CIVILIANS IN NEW </p><p>   YORK AND WASHINGTON LAST MONTH.  IT IS INTOLERABLE </p><p>   ENOUGH TO HAVE ANY GROUP OF TERRORISTS THREATENING </p><p>   ANYONE, BUT IT IS MUCH WORSE WHEN THESE BLOOD-THIRSTY </p><p>   INDIVIDUALS GET OPEN SUPPORT FROM THOSE WHO CALL </p><p>   THEMSELVES GOVERNMENTS AND WHO HIDE BEHIND THE VEIL OF </p><p>   BEING A SOVEREIGN STATE.  SUCH GOVERNMENTS, WHICH </p><p>   ALMOST ALWAYS TERRORIZE THEIR OWN CITIZENS INTO </p><p>   SUBMISSION AND SILENCE, MUST NOW FACE THE FULL WRATH OF </p><p>   A NEW BRAVE WORLD WHEREVER THEY ARE.  WE HOPE THAT ALL </p><p>   DICTATORS WORLDWIDE TAKE NOTE AND RAPIDLY MEND THEIR </p><p>   NEFARIOUS WAYS OR BE THROWN OUT FROM POWER WITH THE </p><p>   VERY INSTRUMENTS OF THEIR REPRESSION.  BUT IN SEEKING A </p><p>   DURABLE AND JUST PEACE, THE U. S.-LED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>   COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM MUST, ONCE THE DUST HAS </p><p>   SETTLED, RE-LOOK WHAT IS PROPELLING THESE DEMENTED MEN </p><p>   AND WOMEN WHOSE BUSINESS IS THE MURDER OF INNOCENTS. </p><p> </p><p>"IN THE CASE OF AFGHANISTAN AND BIN LADEN, IT IS CLEAR </p><p>THAT THE TWO ARE SEEKING TO COVER THEIR TERROR ACTS BY </p><p>INVOKING RELIGION AND WHIPPING UP EMOTIONS OF MANY WHO </p><p>HAVE KNOWN LITTLE PEACE IN THE TORMENTED MIDDLE EAST. </p><p>IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THE U. S. PARTICULARLY MOVES RAPIDLY </p><p>TO AID EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE LONG-RUNNING CONFLICT </p><p>BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS IF THE TERRORISTS </p><p>ARE TO BE DENIED A FERTILE GROUND FOR MORE RECRUITMENTS </p><p>FROM AN EMBITTERED REGION.  FOR TOO LONG, WASHINGTON </p><p>HAS REMAINED ISRAEL\'S STAUNCHEST BACKER IN THE LATTER\'S </p><p>FIGHT AGAINST ARAB NATIONS AS THEY SEARCHED FOR A </p><p>PALESTINIAN HOMELAND.  THIS MUST NOW CHANGE AND </p><p>WASHINGTON MUST BEGIN TO PLAY AND BE SEEN TO BE PLAYING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03047  121035Z </p><p>A KEY BUT NEUTRAL ROLE IN HELPING TO ESTABLISH A </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE, WHICH IS ALL BUT INEVITABLE, THAT CO- </p><p>EXISTS PEACEFULLY WITH ISRAEL.  THERE IS NO OTHER </p><p>CHOICE.  THIS SEA CHANGE IN WASHINGTON\'S FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>SHOULD HELP DEPRIVE FANATICS AND OTHER ZEALOTS OF THEIR </p><p>PURPORTED CAUSE, ISOLATING THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE. </p><p>THIS WAY, THE TERRORISTS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS WHEREVER </p><p>THEY ARE SHOULD THEN BE ISOLATED BY THE ENTIRE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND BE HIT VERY, VERY HARD. </p><p>ONCE THE GUNS OF WAR HAVE FALLEN SILENT, WASHINGTON </p><p>MUST LEAD INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS IN GIVING MASSIVE AID </p><p>FOR AFGHANISTAN\'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RECOVERY UNDER A </p><p>NEW REGIME, WHICH MUST INEVITABLY TAKE OVER FROM THE </p><p>DESPOTIC MULLAHS.  NO ONE IS SUGGESTING THAT WASHINGTON </p><p>WILL FIND ALL THESE STEPS PARTICULARLY PALATABLE, </p><p>ESPECIALLY GIVEN ITS FERVENT SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL, BUT </p><p>HARD CHOICES MUST BE MADE FOR THE JUST CAUSE OF WORLD </p><p>PEACE.  A NEW BRAVE WORLD NOW TAKING SHAPE DESERVES </p><p>NOTHING BUT DURABLE AND JUST PEACE AND NOT THE PEACE OF </p><p>THE DEAD.  THE U. S. HAS AN ENORMOUSLY CRITICAL DUTY </p><p>AND RESPONSIBILITY IN MAKING THIS REAL PEACE A LIVING </p><p>REALITY FOR HUMANKIND." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
