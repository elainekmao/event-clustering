(C) PER REF A INSTRUCTION, POLOFF SPOKE ON AUGUST 28 </p><p>WITH MFA UNDER SECRETARY FOR AFRICA DAVID HAMADZIRIPI TO </p><p>SOLICIT THE GOZ\'S VIEWS ON A POSSIBLE DRC "MINI-SUMMIT" </p><p>ON THE MARGINS OF THE MILLENIUM SUMMIT.  HAMADZIRIPI WAS </p><p>UNAWARE OF PRESIDENT CHILUBA\'S CURRENT EFFORTS BUT SAID </p><p>THE GOZ WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF SUCH A MEETING.  THE </p><p>MILLENIUM SUMMIT WOULD PROVIDE A GOOD OCCASION FOR THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE HEADS OF STATE TO CONSULT AND DETERMINE HOW </p><p>BEST TO MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI SAID THE GOZ HAD RECEIVED NOTHING </p><p>OFFICIAL FROM THE DRC ON ITS ANNOUNCED SUSPENSION OF </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  HIS UNDERSTANDING </p><p>FROM MEDIA REPORTS, HOWEVER, IS THAT THE DRC HAS NOT </p><p>SUSPENDED LUSAKA BUT, RATHER, EXPRESSED ITS VIEW THAT </p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS MAY REQUIRE A "REVISION" OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENTS.  HAMADZIRIPI NOTED THAT ARTICLE 26, CHAPTER 3 </p><p>OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS DOES ALLOW REVISIONS, BUT IT WAS </p><p>NOT YET CLEAR PRECISELY WHAT CHANGES THE DRC WAS SEEKING. </p><p>IN THE MEANTIME, AS FAR AS THE GOZ IS CONCERNED, "LUSAKA </p><p>REMAINS VERY MUCH ALIVE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ASKED ABOUT THE DRC\'S INITIATIVES WITH REGARD TO </p><p>A QUADRIPARTITE SUMMIT OF DROC, RWANDA, UGANDA, AND </p><p>BURUNDI UNDER OAU AUSPICES, HAMADZIRIPI SAID THE GOZ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04753  281218Z </p><p>WELCOMED ANY MEETING INTENDED TO CONTRIBUTE TO </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  HAMADZIRIPI WAS </p><p>MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT KABILA\'S APPARENT WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO ACCOMMODATE THE UN MONUC PHASE II DEPLOYMENT.  IT WAS </p><p>NOT YET CLEAR, HE SAID, THAT ALL OF KABILA\'S AND THE UN\'S </p><p>OBJECTIONS HAD BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED SO THAT THE </p><p>DEPLOYMENT COULD MOVE FORWARD. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI\'S MORE CAUTIOUS ASSESSMENT ON THE </p><p>MONUC DEPLOYMENT DIFFERED FROM THAT PROVIDED ON AUGUST 25 </p><p>BY FORMER INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE MINISTER NATHAN </p><p>SHAMUYARIRA, WHO CONVEYED TO US IN REF B MUGABE\'S </p><p>UNDERSTANDING THAT KABILA WAS WILLING TO ALLOW THE </p><p>DEPLOYMENT TO GO FORWARD.  THE DIVERGENCE IN THEIR </p><p>UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHAT KABILA PLANS TO DO NEXT IS, IN OUR </p><p>VIEW, NOT SURPRISING, GIVEN THE OFTEN CONFLICTING SIGNALS </p><p>COMING OUT OF KINSHASA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DAVID HAMADZIRIPI IS THE MFA\'S MOST SENIOR OFFICIAL </p><p>REGULARLY AND ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON DRC-RELATED ISSUES, AND </p><p>HE IS A FREQUENT AND RELIABLE MISSION CONTACT.  MFA </p><p>CURRENTLY HAS NO DEPUTY MINISTER AND WE HAD HOPED TO </p><p>DELIVER REF A INSTRUCTION TO THE RECENTLY-APPOINTED MFA </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY -- WILLARD CHIWEWE -- BUT HE </p><p>APPARENTLY IS NOT YET FULLY ON BOARD.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPECTS TO MEET SHORTLY WITH CHIWEWE, WHO MOST RECENTLY </p><p>SERVED AS PERMANENT SECRETARY AT THE INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTRY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04753  281218Z </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
