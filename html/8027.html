<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000806 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA:ABENAISSA, 4530 MAC/AP/OSA/O:LDROKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR OTA:GSMITH, SRI LANKA DESK:GRAO </p><p> </p><p>E.O 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EFIN, CE, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKAN GROWTH EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1. According to the latest data released by the </p><p>Central Bank, Sri Lanka\'s economy expanded by 4% in </p><p>2002, recovering from a 1.4% downturn in 2001. </p><p>Growth exceeded Bank expectations of 3.5%, and came </p><p>mainly from the services sector.  Despite this modest </p><p>increase, Central Bank expressed concern over </p><p>declining national savings, investments and </p><p>government revenues.  Most other macroeconomic </p><p>fundamentals, which deteriorated sharply in 2001, </p><p>were partly restored during the year.  The current </p><p>peaceful conditions, critical for economic recovery, </p><p>are expected to last, leading to projections of 5.5% </p><p>growth this year.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GROWTH FUELED BY SERVICES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>2.   The Central Bank of Sri Lanka released the final </p><p>economic statistics for 2002 last week.  The Bank </p><p>said the economy recovered with 4% growth after </p><p>shrinking 1.4% in 2001.  This exceeded the Bank\'s </p><p>earlier forecasts of 3.5%.  At current prices, Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s GDP is now $16.6 billion and per capita </p><p>income is $872. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Growth was gradual during 2002, but not broad </p><p>based, coming mainly from the services sector.  The </p><p>economy expanded slowly in the first half and </p><p>accelerated to 6% in the second half.  The high </p><p>second half growth shows recovery from the low base </p><p>in the comparable period in 2001, when the economy </p><p>suffered badly from terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka </p><p>and the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>4. The services sector expanded by 6% and accounted </p><p>for about 80% of overall growth in 2002.  The strong </p><p>performance in services - mainly telecommunications, </p><p>tourism, ports, trade and finance - is attributed to </p><p>this sector\'s flexibility in a changing environment. </p><p>Agriculture grew by 2.5%, staging a partial recovery </p><p>from a 3.4% downturn in 2001.  The industrial sector </p><p>grew slowest at 1% due to weak export demand. </p><p>Domestic consumer demand contributed significantly to </p><p>growth and aggregate demand.  The contribution to </p><p>overall growth from investment was just 12%.  The </p><p>Central Bank reported a notable increase in corporate </p><p>profits (i.e., of the 30 largest companies on the </p><p>Colombo Stock Exchange) during the year when compared </p><p>to 2001. </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT, SAVINGS, INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  The Central Bank expressed concern over the </p><p>falling national savings and investments ratios. </p><p>National savings declined to 19.7% of GDP from 20.3% </p><p>in 2001 while investment declined to 21.3% of GDP </p><p>from 22% in 2001.  Both were well below the rates of </p><p>25% and 28% of GDP, respectively, required to achieve </p><p>sustainable growth of 7-8%. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Inflation declined to 9.6% in 2002 from 14.2% in </p><p>2001 despite price increases in a number of goods and </p><p>utility services.  This decline in inflation was the </p><p>result of high real interest rates that checked </p><p>demand, the relative stability of the exchange rate, </p><p>low import prices, increased supply, and peace, as </p><p>well as the absence of major wage increases. </p><p>According to data for the first three quarters, </p><p>unemployment has risen to 9.1% of 2002 from 7.9% in </p><p>2001 with 641,000 unemployed.  Underemployment also </p><p>remained high.  The sharp increase in unemployment </p><p>was partly due to increased labor force </p><p>participation. </p><p> </p><p>FISCAL CONTROL </p><p>-------------- </p><p>7.  The government was able to exert fiscal control </p><p>after experiencing major slippages in 2001.  The </p><p>budget deficit was restricted to 8.9% of GDP, a </p><p>significant improvement from 10.8% deficit recorded </p><p>in 2001, although it was still higher than the </p><p>budgeted estimate of 8.5% of GDP for 2002.  Revenue </p><p>was below expectations at 16.5% of GDP.  With revenue </p><p>shortfalls of Rs 17 billion (approx. $178 million), </p><p>budgetary control was achieved through expenditure </p><p>cuts, which restricted government spending to 25.4% </p><p>of GDP.   The Central Bank expressed concern over </p><p>falling revenues.  Revenue slipped from 21% of GDP in </p><p>the early 1990s due to tax exemptions and a decline </p><p>in revenue mobilization.  Public debt reached 105.3% </p><p>of GDP. </p><p> </p><p>TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS - CAPITAL FLOWS HELP </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>8.  On the external front, export sector performance </p><p>was disappointing, declining by 2%.  Imports </p><p>increased by 2%.  Consequently, the trade deficit </p><p>increased to $1.41 billion in 2002 from $1.15 billion </p><p>in 2001.  The Services account improved </p><p>significantly, recording a surplus of $271 million. </p><p>Private remittances also grew strongly by 11% to $1.3 </p><p>billion.  The current account recorded a deficit of </p><p>1.6% of GDP, but was offset by a surplus in the </p><p>capital account.  The BOP recorded a surplus of $338 </p><p>million compared to a surplus of $220 million in </p><p>2001.  Gross official reserves rose to $1.7 billion </p><p>at end of 2002, sufficient to finance 4.9 months of </p><p>imports. </p><p> </p><p>OUTLOOK FOR 2003: GROWTH AND THE PEACE DIVIDEND </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>9.  According to the Central Bank, the Sri Lankan </p><p>economy is expected to grow by 5.5% in 2003.  All </p><p>major sectors of the economy are expected to expand. </p><p>This growth will, however, depend on the continuation </p><p>of the peace process, policy adjustments </p><p>(particularly budgetary control) and structural </p><p>reforms.  Recovery in the global economy is also </p><p>needed - especially demand for Sri Lanka\'s apparel </p><p>exports and effective utilization of concessionary </p><p>assistance announced by IMF and other donors. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Inflationary pressures are expected to further </p><p>decline and annual inflation is expected at 7.5%. </p><p>The trade deficit is forecast to rise as imports grow </p><p>faster than exports, due to increasing investor and </p><p>consumer confidence.  Foreign financial flows are </p><p>expected to rise and contribute to a BOP surplus once </p><p>again.  Investment is projected to increase from </p><p>21.5% of GDP in 2002 to 24% in 2003.  The budget </p><p>deficit is forecast around 7.5% of GDP, almost 1.5% </p><p>lower than in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>11.  At a seminar to explain the outcome of 2002 </p><p>economic performance, Central Bank\'s director for </p><p>economic research said that the economy has been </p><p>helped by the current cease-fire and ongoing peace </p><p>process.  Peace has led to an increase in economic </p><p>activity (especially in agriculture, tourism, trade </p><p>and internal transport) and the containment of non- </p><p>productive expenditure.  Significantly, defense </p><p>expenditure has declined to 4.0% of GDP in 2002 from </p><p>4.9% in 2001.  In nominal terms, the actual defense </p><p>bill was Rs 60 billion ($627 million) in 2002, </p><p>compared with an estimated requirement of Rs 100 </p><p>billion ($1 billion) in the absence of peace. </p><p> </p><p>12.  These savings have contributed to a reduction of </p><p>2% of GDP in the budget deficit, helped to contain </p><p>the rapid increase of public debt witnessed in the </p><p>previous years and, at least partially, reigned in </p><p>other macroeconomic imbalances in the economy.  The </p><p>relative decline in government demand for domestic </p><p>resources (due to lower defense spending) helped to </p><p>ease the pressure on interest rates.  The </p><p>availability of goods and services increased, due to </p><p>removal of road barriers.  Business confidence also </p><p>rose as indicated by sharp increases in the Colombo </p><p>Stock Exchange (CSE) indices.  CSE indices rose 45% </p><p>during 2002.  Defense related imports also declined, </p><p>easing pressure on external assets. </p><p> </p><p>13.  More importantly, the peaceful environment has </p><p>created a conducive environment for the government to </p><p>launch the key - and difficult - structural reforms </p><p>needed for economic management.  These include labor </p><p>market reforms, increases in administered prices, </p><p>privatization, and social safety net reforms.  It </p><p>also enabled the government to announce explicit </p><p>short and medium term fiscal discipline targets </p><p>contained in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) </p><p>Act.  Critically, the environment enabled donors to </p><p>approve long-term concessionary funds required to </p><p>rebuild Sri Lanka under PRGF facilities. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
