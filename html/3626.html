<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002008 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOVERNMENT PAPER BLAMES OPPOSITION PARTY AND "THE </p><p>WEST" FOR BOMBING OF RADIO STATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 01984 </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The government-controlled "Herald" used its August 31 </p><p>      editorial to suggest that the bombing of the "Voice of the </p><p>      People" radio station offices on August 29 was the work of </p><p>      western-sponsored "enemies of Zimbabwe" bent on sullying </p><p>      the nation\'s reputation. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under the title "Stop smear campaign" the paper </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The bombing comes in the wake of plans by </p><p>      members of the white Commonwealth at the Earth </p><p>      Summit on WSSD in South Africa to discuss Zimbabwe. </p><p>      There is no doubt that the whole incident has been </p><p>      timed to embarrass the Zimbabwean government, so </p><p>      that the British and their allies have something to </p><p>      discuss and justify their condemnation of Zimbabwe. </p><p>      The ploy is obvious. . .  The Americans, the British </p><p>      and the European Union have already ganged up </p><p>      calling on the Earth Summit. . .to condemn President </p><p>      Mugabe. . .  They are accusing Zimbabwe of the </p><p>      bombing claiming it is a clear signal that freedom </p><p>      of speech has no place in the country.  As </p><p>      Zimbabweans we are not deterred or surprised by </p><p>      these onslaughts by the West.  They have a mission </p><p>      to accomplish.  The attack on the government before </p><p>      any investigations are concluded shows a high degree </p><p>      of shortsightedness on their part. . . Rushing to </p><p>      conclusions on the radio station\'s bombing is not </p><p>      justified. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Bombing of radio station </p><p>      predictable: Attack provides Zim\'s enemies with </p><p>      chance to launch fresh onslaught" the same newspaper </p><p>      carried the following opinion piece political editor </p><p>      Phillip Magwaza: </p><p> </p><p>      "As expected, Thursday\'s bombing of the offices of </p><p>      the illegal private radio station (VOP). . .has </p><p>      provided Zimbabwe\'s sworn political enemies a golden </p><p>      opportunity to launch a fresh attack on the country. </p><p>      Before the ashes of the explosion had gone cold, </p><p>      Britain and the United States were on cue to condemn </p><p>      the bombing, which they linked to previous attacks </p><p>      on the independent media. . .  The cowardly attack </p><p>      was so predictable as it came barely four days </p><p>      before President Mugabe addressed the WSSD in South </p><p>      Africa. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .It is only logical to assume that the failure </p><p>      by the British, the Americans and the MDC to put </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s land reforms on the agenda of the summit </p><p>      could have had something to do with the bomb attack. </p><p>      . . .The recent statement made by the American </p><p>      Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Mr. </p><p>      Walter Kansteiner about working closely with the </p><p>      independent media to topple the government now makes </p><p>      sense. . .  It is a shameful act that after </p><p>      Kansteiner\'s statement, a house belonging to the so- </p><p>      called independent media is bombed.  What a </p><p>      coincidence. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
