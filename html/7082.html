<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 000828 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, IO, AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 04/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ETRD, AORC, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: BUDGET CUTS HARM ALREADY STRUGGLING HONDURAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  TEGUCIGALPA 652 </p><p> </p><p>B.  02 TEGUCIGALPA 3407 </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Larry Palmer; reasons 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: Severe budget cuts at the Honduran Ministry </p><p>of Foreign Affairs threaten to incapacitate its ability to </p><p>execute a coherent foreign policy strategy.  The cuts, </p><p>amounting to 31 percent since President Ricardo Maduro came </p><p>into office early last year, mean new layoffs and embassy </p><p>closings, plus more work for the already overloaded staff </p><p>who remain.  Several items on the Ministry\'s agenda affect </p><p>the U.S., including support for the Coalition of the </p><p>Willing, the current CAFTA negotiation and the country\'s </p><p>request to extend Temporary Protected Status for Honduran </p><p>immigrants.  The present understaffed and overworked status </p><p>of MFA functionaries limits their ability to respond in a </p><p>timely manner to U.S. initiatives and demarches.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Honduran Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) </p><p>supports approximately 160 employees spread throughout 36 </p><p>embassies, 13 consulates and 31 consular sections. </p><p>Honduras also has 45 honorary consulates whose consuls do </p><p>not earn formal salaries.  However, the Ministry is in the </p><p>midst of significant budget cuts.  Sources vary on the </p><p>exact amount of the cuts (see ref B for previous reporting </p><p>on MFA budget cuts).  Post received the following figures </p><p>from Ambassador Mario Fortin and the Honduran press.  In </p><p>2002, the MFA\'s allowance was cut 17 percent, leaving it at </p><p>272 million lempiras, or approximately USD 16 million.  For </p><p>calendar year 2003, the budget was cut yet again, this time </p><p>by 14 percent. As a result, the MFA in 2003 has less than </p><p>USD 14 million with which to support both its domestic and </p><p>foreign operations--only 69 percent of the Ministry\'s 2001 </p><p>budget. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The MFA\'s diminishing finances are a growing </p><p>impediment to the country\'s ability to effectively supply </p><p>and manage its domestic and international posts and carry </p><p>out a coherent foreign policy.  Primarily, these budget </p><p>cuts mean a reduction in personnel and embassy closings </p><p>and/or consolidations.  According to Honduran foreign </p><p>service officers, however, conditions at overseas posts are </p><p>already spartan.  Posts have minimal support staff, even in </p><p>comparison to other Central American embassies.  Most </p><p>Honduran ambassadors earn between USD 4,000 and 6,000 per </p><p>month, plus an equivalent stipend for expenses.  Salaries </p><p>and expense allowances for ambassadors to the U.S. and some </p><p>other countries, including Japan, are higher due to cost of </p><p>living allowances.  In December 2002 the salary for the </p><p>ambassador to Japan was USD 10,000 monthly plus a USD </p><p>20,000 monthly expense allowance  (Note:  These figures </p><p>were reported in U.S. dollars in the Honduran press.  End </p><p>Note.)  According to the Honduran paper "El Heraldo," the </p><p>ambassadorship to Japan has often stayed vacant for </p><p>extended periods of time because no one has been willing to </p><p>accept the position, presumably due to lack of sufficient </p><p>funding.  Foreign Minister Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias </p><p>was recently quoted in the Honduran press acknowledging </p><p>that ambassadorial salaries were too low and blaming the </p><p>two recent budget cuts. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Despite these financial concerns, the MFA recently </p><p>unveiled an ambitious agenda for 2003.  The agenda </p><p>includes: </p><p>--Restructuring of personnel in the Ministry, mainly due to </p><p>budget cuts (i.e., dismissals and embassy </p><p>closures/consolidations) </p><p>--CAFTA signing, </p><p>--Working with USG to extend Temporary Protected Status </p><p>(TPS) for Honduran migrants to the U.S., </p><p>--Presentation of observations on the Solicitation of </p><p>Revision presented by El Salvador to the International </p><p>Court of Justice (concerning the El Salvador/Honduras </p><p>border dispute), </p><p>--Making progress on maritime border demarcation with </p><p>Nicaragua through the International Court of Justice, </p><p>--Overcoming technical problems in the demarcation of the </p><p>Honduras-El Salvador border, </p><p>--Continuation of negotiations of maritime boundaries with </p><p>Mexico, Cuba, and the OAS agreement on the Gulf of Honduras </p><p>(on the Caribbean coast), </p><p>--Suspension of the 35 percent tariff imposed by Nicaragua </p><p>(this was already accomplished through the temporary </p><p>suspension of the tariff on March 11 - see ref A), </p><p>--Consolidation of the Customs Union for Central America, </p><p>and </p><p>--Continuation of the Plan Puebla Panama. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) COMMENT:  Post is concerned that the 31 percent </p><p>total cut in the MFA\'s budget over the last year and a half </p><p>is significantly detrimental to the Ministry\'s ability to </p><p>achieve its agenda goals.  For Example, Director General </p><p>for Foreign Policy, Ambassador Mario Fortin, has been an </p><p>excellent contact within the MFA for Post.  However, due to </p><p>limited staffing, he is forced to cover a wide range of </p><p>countries and issues. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED:  Proposed restructuring in the </p><p>MFA has had a very negative impact on morale.  At times, it </p><p>appears that Ambassador Fortin is a one-man shop.  He has </p><p>no substantive staff to whom he can delegate.  Other </p><p>diplomats have told us that they believe he is completely </p><p>overburdened by the range of issues he covers.  Post is </p><p>also concerned that cuts and or elimination of GOH posts </p><p>abroad could be highly problematic in the case of a natural </p><p>disaster, as Honduran embassies abroad were instrumental in </p><p>gathering vital international aid after the 1998 tragedy of </p><p>Hurricane Mitch. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment CONTINUTED:  There are a limited number of </p><p>subject experts on technical issues in the MFA, leaving the </p><p>GOH with little or no input on many complex international </p><p>issues.  Post notes that the MFA\'s lack of technical </p><p>experts allows the U.S. to play an influential advisory </p><p>role in Honduran foreign affairs.  However, the MFA\'s bare- </p><p>bones staff and lack of administrative support means that </p><p>it cannot easily form or implement a coherent foreign </p><p>policy strategy.  A good example:  last week in his visit </p><p>to D.C. Foreign Minister Perez-Cadalso assured U.S. </p><p>interlocutors that Honduras would be supportive of the U.S. </p><p>at the U.N.  It appears that such forward-leaning </p><p>instructions were never sent to New York, as the Honduran </p><p>PermRep to the U.N. delivered a weaker statement at UNSC </p><p>open session on Iraq March 27 than he had before the war. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
