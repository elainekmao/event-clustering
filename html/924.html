<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RIYADH 000879 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/ARP </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  03/14/08 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA:  BEDOUIN LORE ON CROWN PRINCE </p><p>          ABDULLAH\'S TRIBAL POWER BASE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  RIYADH 730 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION THEODORE KATTOUF. </p><p>REASON:  1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THE ANAYZA TRIBE, CROWN </p><p>PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF POWER LIES IN THE SHAMMAR AND </p><p>ANAYZA TRIBES.  HE HAS MARRIED INTO BOTH TRIBES, DRAWS ON THEM FOR </p><p>THE MAJORITY OF HIS NATIONAL GUARDSMEN, AND HAS PREVIOUSLY RELIED </p><p>ON THEM TO PRESERVE HIS COMMAND OF THE NATIONAL GUARD IN THE FACE </p><p>OF AN INTRA-FAMILY EFFORT TO DEPRIVE HIM OF IT.  WHETHER TRUE OR </p><p>NOT, THESE COMMENTS REFLECT THE POPULAR LORE UNDERLYING MUCH OF </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S POLITICAL APPEAL TO THE SAUDI PUBLIC.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>TALKING ABOUT ABDULLAH </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) POLOFF SPENT A RECENT AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE LEADING FAMILY OF THE SUBAIE, ONE OF THE FOUR PRINCIPAL </p><p>SUBTRIBES OF THE ANAYZA--FIRST IN THE HOME OF A FAMILY MEMBER AND </p><p>THEN IN THE FAMILY TENT.  GATHERED IN THE TENT THAT EVENING WERE </p><p>THREE OF THE TRIBAL SHEIKH\'S BROTHERS, THREE OF HIS FIRST COUSINS </p><p>(TWO OF WHOM ARE U.S.-EDUCATED), NUMEROUS MORE DISTANT COUSINS, </p><p>VARIOUS TRIBAL RETAINERS, AND A VISITING SHEIKH OF ANOTHER TRIBE. </p><p>THEY CHATTED, SIPPED TEA, AND PLAYED CARDS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) IN ADDITION TO CONFIRMING THE WIDELY HELD BELIEF THAT </p><p>CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH IS THE LEAST CORRUPT OR "CLEANEST" OF THE </p><p>SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, THE CONVERSATION REVEALED THE </p><p>GREAT EXTENT TO WHICH THESE TRIBESMEN BELIEVE--NO DOUBT TO AN </p><p>EXAGGERATED EXTENT--THAT ABDULLAH\'S POWER BASE LIES IN HIS TRIBAL </p><p>TIES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S TWO MAIN TRIBES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C) SPECIFICALLY, THE CONVERSATION BROUGHT OUT THE FOLLOWING </p><p>BELIEFS.   ABDULLAH\'S TWO MAIN TRIBAL SUPPORTERS ARE THE SHAMMAR-- </p><p>HIS MOTHER\'S TRIBE--AND THE ANAYZA.  BOTH ARE LARGE, HISTORICALLY </p><p>POWERFUL NORTHERN TRIBES.   HE HAS TWICE MARRIED INTO EACH TRIBE, </p><p>THEREBY CEMENTING HIS EXISTING TIES TO THE SHAMMAR (THROUGH HIS </p><p>MOTHER, A SHAMMAR) OR FORGING NEW ONES TO THE ANAYZA.  AS COMMANDER </p><p>OF THE NATIONAL GUARD, ABDULLAH HAS DRAWN PRIMARILY ON THESE TWO </p><p>TRIBES.  OUR SOURCE ESTIMATES THAT SIXTY TO SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF </p><p>THE ACTIVE NATIONAL GUARD ARE SHAMMAR AND ANAYZA TRIBESMEN. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>SAVING HIS COMMAND OF THE NATIONAL GUARD </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) ONE MAN TOLD THE FOLLOWING STORY TO ILLUSTRATE THE </p><p>SUPPOSED SUPPORT ABDULLAH RECEIVES FROM THE SHAMMAR AND ANAYZA </p><p>TRIBES.  DURING THE TIME OF KING FAYSAL (D. 1975), CERTAIN FACTIONS </p><p>OF THE ROYAL FAMILY WERE CONCERNED THAT ABDULLAH WAS GROWING TOO </p><p>POWERFUL AND WANTED TO TAKE THE NATIONAL GUARD AWAY FROM HIM AND </p><p>PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF A LESS POWERFUL GOVERNMENT ENTITY.  WHEN </p><p>ABDULLAH WAS IN THE NORTH VISITING THE TRIBES, HE LET THEM KNOW </p><p>THAT HE WAS UPSET BY THE PROSPECT OF LOSING COMMAND OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>GUARD.  ON THE ADVICE OF THE TRIBAL SHEIKHS, ABDULLAH PUT THE </p><p>NATIONAL GUARD ON MANEUVERS AND REMAINED IN THE NORTH WITH THE </p><p>TRIBES.  IN NO TIME, KEY MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY STARTED ASKING </p><p>WHY THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS ON MANEUVERS, WHERE ABDULLAH WAS, AND </p><p>WHO HE WAS WITH.  WHEN THEY LEARNED HE WAS IN THE NORTH WITH </p><p>SHEIKHS OF THE SHAMMAR AND ANAYZA TRIBES, THEY UNDERSTOOD THE WILL </p><p>OF THE TRIBES AND GOT WORD TO ABDULLAH THAT HE WOULD REMAIN IN </p><p>COMMAND OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (C) COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH SELF-GRATIFYING AND NO DOUBT </p><p>EXAGGERATED--IF NOT ALTOGETHER APOCRYPHAL--THE STATISTICS AND STORY </p><p>HIGHLIGHT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE TRIBESMEN BELIEVE THAT A </p><p>SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BINDS ABDULLAH AND THE TRIBES AND THAT HE IS </p><p>THEIR MAN IN THE GOVERNMENT.  REFTEL DESCRIBES THE GENERAL </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF TRIBAL SUPPORT TO THE AL SAUD.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>FOWLER </p><p></p></div>
