<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ADANA 0005 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>JANUARY 8, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for January 8, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"BALCONIES OVERLOOKING INCIRLIK AIR BASE FOR RENT" </p><p>(Radikal/Bolge)  Merchants at the Wholesalers\' </p><p>Complex across from Adana\'s Incirlik Air Base </p><p>offered the balconies of their places of business </p><p>for rent prior to the possible U.S. operation </p><p>against Iraq.  Some media organizations wanted to </p><p>rent these workplaces\' balconies to watch the </p><p>taking off and landing of fighters and other </p><p>military planes more comfortably.  One merchant who </p><p>refused to disclose his name announced having </p><p>allocated his balcony to a television station. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INCREASED ANTI-WAR SENSITIVITY IN MALATYA </p><p>(Evrensel)  Representatives of organizations and </p><p>institutions forming the Malatya War Opponents </p><p>Platform pointed to increased anti-war sensitivity </p><p>following reports that the U.S. wants to use that </p><p>province\'s Erhac Air Base in the event of war in </p><p>Iraq.  The representatives stressed that a majority </p><p>of the public were against this war and that it </p><p>could be prevented through the public\'s will. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OPPOSITION AGAINST POSSIBILITY OF DIYARBAKIR </p><p>BECOMING A TARGET </p><p>(Evrensel)  Behcet Balik, President of the </p><p>Diyarbakir Young Businessmen\'s Association </p><p>(DIGIAD), expressed opposition to the possible U.S. </p><p>operation against Iraq, saying the use by the U.S. </p><p>of the Diyarbakir Air Base would turn the region </p><p>into a target for Iraq.  Ali Oncu, President of the </p><p>Diyarbakir chapter of the nationwide Tes-Is labor </p><p>union, called for struggle against (this) war.  The </p><p>Diyarbakir Physicians Chamber President, Necdet </p><p>Ipekyuz, said hospitals, physicians and the number </p><p>of beds were not sufficient in Diyarbakir, which is </p><p>included in the list of critical provinces due to </p><p>U.S. preparations for an operation against Iraq. </p><p>The SES health employees\' union Diyarbakir chapter </p><p>president complained the State did not care about </p><p>the region\'s people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KANADOGLU:  ERDOGAN CANNOT BE NOMINATED FROM SIIRT </p><p>(All papers)  Supreme Court of Appeals Chief </p><p>Prosecutor Sabih Kanadoglu said new candidates </p><p>cannot be nominated in the Siirt elections, which </p><p>are characterized as "a continuation and renewal" </p><p>of the November 3 parliamentary elections, </p><p>signaling that he would object to AK Party leader </p><p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan\'s candidacy (in that </p><p>province).  Kanadoglu based his argument on the </p><p>Member of Parliament Election Law\'s Article 25, </p><p>which prevents nomination of new candidates in the </p><p>renewal of an election, as well as on Article 16, </p><p>which says one person cannot run twice in the same </p><p>election, i.e. from two different constituencies. </p><p>Thus, Kanadoglu expressed an opinion against a </p><p>(recent) Higher Election Council (YSK) decision </p><p>stating that "new candidates may be nominated in </p><p>the Siirt elections in the event of a resignation </p><p>or death."  Kanadoglu indicated the recent </p><p>Constitutional amendments removing legal obstacles </p><p>in front of Erdogan could not be implemented in the </p><p>Siirt elections, as they were "a continuation" of </p><p>the November 3 elections.  He noted that these </p><p>rules would only be valid in case of a by-election. </p><p>Sabah quoted AK Party officials as negatively </p><p>reacting to Kanadoglu by saying that "it is YSK </p><p>that will make a decision on this".  AK Party vice </p><p>national president Dengir Firat noted that acting </p><p>with Kanadoglu\'s mindset would mean that Fadil </p><p>Akgunduz can re-nominate himself.  (Note: </p><p>Akgunduz, a fugitive sought for swindling for a </p><p>long time, was elected to the parliament in the </p><p>November 3 elections through an election campaign </p><p>carried out by his attorney, but was arrested and </p><p>jailed soon after the Siirt elections were </p><p>canceled.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VILLAGE GUARD SALARIES UNDER INVESTIGATION </p><p>(Turkiye)  The Bitlis Governor\'s Office launched a </p><p>comprehensive investigation to look into monthly </p><p>salaries and severance pay paid to local village </p><p>guards since 1990.  The investigation stemmed from </p><p>increased complaints that some village guards had </p><p>received payments although they should not have </p><p>been paid and vice versa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF PRESSURE AGAINST MARDIN INMATES </p><p>(Evrensel)  Relatives of inmates incarcerated in </p><p>Mardin\'s E-type prison complained about </p><p>maltreatment in the prison.  Inmates\' complaints </p><p>included: </p><p>- Fourteen inmates were put in six-person wards </p><p>  and 24 inmates in eight-person ones; </p><p>- Wards\' walls were painted in colors </p><p>  displeasing to inmates\' eyes; </p><p>- Threats of epidemic diseases; </p><p>- Poisoning from prison food; </p><p>- Prohibition of publications not banned by </p><p>  courts; and </p><p>- Insult by soldiers and prison guards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SANLIURFA VILLAGERS APPLY TO HRA FOR ASSISTANCE </p><p>(Evrensel)  Mehmet Sakin, a resident of Siverek\'s </p><p>(Sanliurfa) Hebana village whose brother was </p><p>seriously wounded when five local village guards </p><p>allegedly opened fire on their vehicle on route to </p><p>Viransehir to take revenge because of a blood feud </p><p>between them, applied to the Human Rights </p><p>Association (HRA) in Gaziantep for assistance. </p><p>Based on Sakin\'s testimony, the village guards were </p><p>arrested, but were later set free. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HONOR KILLING IN BATMAN </p><p>(Cumhuriyet/Radikal/Turkiye)  Twenty-four-year-old </p><p>Sevide Uyanik of Sason\'s (Batman) Gecitli village </p><p>was found dead on December 30, with her three-day- </p><p>old baby strangled and thrown two kilometers </p><p>outside the village.  Uyanik\'s relatives reported </p><p>the incident to the local Jandarma command as a </p><p>suicide.  However, an investigation by the Sason </p><p>Prosecutor\'s Office revealed that Uyanik had </p><p>delivered a baby before dying and that there were </p><p>signs of two Kalashnikov bullets in her body.  Her </p><p>son and brother-in-law Mahmut Uyanik, to whose home </p><p>she and her husband\'s second wife moved after her </p><p>husband had been ordered held for smuggling, were </p><p>arrested.  The arrestees were later ordered to </p><p>remain in custody.  Prosecutor Mehmet Firat said a </p><p>DNA test would help find out who the baby\'s father </p><p>was, how it died, and with whom the killed woman </p><p>had an intercourse.  Firat added that a sample </p><p>taken from the baby\'s body had already been sent to </p><p>the Istanbul Forensic Medical Department (for </p><p>analysis). </p><p>SANLIURFA YOUTHS AGAINST THE CLAN SYSTEM </p><p>(Evrensel)  A survey carried out by a group of </p><p>Sanliurfa\'s Harran University students on 83 of </p><p>their peers, among them 33 women, showed that </p><p>youths were against the "clan" or "tribal" system </p><p>that still prevails in the Southeast.  The survey </p><p>also found out that 40% of the students were clan </p><p>members, while 63% thought it was not important to </p><p>have ties to a clan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEFENDANT IN THE CASE OF SLAIN THAI TOURIST </p><p>CONVICTED </p><p>(Turkiye)  The Sanliurfa Felony Court convicted 21- </p><p>year-old Serdar Beyazit of "rape, murder and </p><p>extortion."  Beyazit was the only defendant in the </p><p>case of Thai tourist Liu Chie Ying, who was found </p><p>dead in her room of a Sanliurfa hotel after being </p><p>sexually assaulted and killed.  Beyazit was </p><p>sentenced to a prison term of ten years for </p><p>extortion, seven years for rape and life </p><p>imprisonment for murder. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM" CASE AGAINST ADANA </p><p>MAYOR DURAK </p><p>(Radikal/Milliyet)  Adana Mayor Aytac Durak faces a </p><p>"Where did you get it from" case.  (Note: </p><p>Ironically, the Mayor himself once brought a libel </p><p>suit against individuals who had said of him:  "He </p><p>owns half of Adana".)  Following a complaint to the </p><p>Justice Ministry and reports by a local newspaper </p><p>on Durak and his family\'s assets and property, </p><p>Interior Ministry inspectors launched an </p><p>investigation against Durak.  According to the Land </p><p>Registry Office, Durak and his spouse own 1.7 </p><p>million square meters of land; his son and daughter </p><p>have 17 houses/apartments and places of business </p><p>(offices).  Prosecutor Vedat Mentes opened the case </p><p>after he found out Durak had acquired enormous </p><p>wealth after being elected mayor.  If convicted of </p><p>"untrue property declaration and unjust property </p><p>obtainment," Durak will be sentenced to a prison </p><p>term of eight years and his unjustly-obtained </p><p>property will be confiscated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"ATATURK DAM PRINTING MONEY" </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  Sanliurfa\'s Ataturk Dam and Hydro- </p><p>electric Power Plant produced over five billion </p><p>kilowatt hours of energy (electricity), amounting </p><p>to nearly USD 250 million.  Production by the eight </p><p>units (turbines) of the Ataturk Dam, which </p><p>constitutes the most important part of the </p><p>Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP), exceeded 2002 </p><p>targets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCIAL CREDITS FOR ADANA BUSINESSMEN </p><p>(Milliyet/Bolge)  Disbank and the Adana Chamber of </p><p>Commerce (ACOC) signed a protocol agreement to </p><p>enable ACOC members to take advantage of Disbank\'s </p><p>"Entrepreneur Support Credit".  Under the </p><p>agreement, Disbank will provide small- and medium- </p><p>scale industries (KOBI\'s) with long-term, fixed- </p><p>rate and flexible-paying commercial and other </p><p>credits ranging from TL 5-50 billion (approx. USD </p><p>3,000-30,000). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN INTEREST IN SANLIURFA KILIMS </p><p>(Milli Gazete)  Kilims woven by 50 Siverek </p><p>(Sanliurfa) girls in carpet looms established by </p><p>the Social Assistance and Solidarity Foundation, an </p><p>affiliate of the district governor\'s office, </p><p>reportedly have entered the European market.  The </p><p>paper points to big demand from Denmark, Germany, </p><p>the Netherlands, France and other European </p><p>countries for these kilims bearing historical, </p><p>Central Asian, and Karakeci (an ancient Turkish </p><p>tribe) motifs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TOBACCO FARMERS NOW FREQUENTERS OF COFFEEHOUSES </p><p>(Evrensel)  With tobacco cultivation declining </p><p>nearly to zero, tobacco farmers in Batman\'s Kozluk </p><p>township are now spending their time in local </p><p>coffeehouses.  A majority of Kozluk\'s 30,000 people </p><p>are now jobless as there are not many job </p><p>opportunities outside tobacco cultivation.  The </p><p>number of coffeehouses has reportedly risen to a </p><p>peak of 60 from only four or five two years ago. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
