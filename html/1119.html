ALBRIGHT </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE </p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. 20520 </p><p>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE HAGUE, 6 JUNE 2000 </p><p>NO 10656(00)VL/GB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEAR MADAM SECRETARY OF STATE: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION AND ACCESS TO CHILDREN ABROAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON AND BUNDESKANZLER </p><p>SCHRODER AT THEIR MEETING IN BERLIN ON 1 JUNE 2000 HAVE </p><p>AGREED THAT A JOINT EXPERTS GROUP SHOULD EXAMINE WAYS TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE OPERATION OF THE HAGUE CONVENTION OF 25 OCTOBER </p><p>1980 ON THE CIVIL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION AS </p><p>BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONCERNS EXPRESSED IN THE UNITED STATES, IN PARTICULAR BY </p><p>CONGRESS, AND ECHOED IN OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE SUBJECT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION AND ACCESS TO CHILDREN ABROAD </p><p>PROMPT ME TO SUGGEST CERTAIN PRACTICAL MEASURES WHICH WILL </p><p>HELP TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT SITUATION.  AS SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>OF THE HAGUE CONFERENCE, THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR DRAWING UP THE HAGUE CHILD ABDUCTION </p><p>CONVENTION, I FEEL STRONG RESPONSIBILITY, SHARED BY MY </p><p>COLLEAGUES, FOR ENSURING THAT THE CONVENTION OPERATES TO ITS </p><p>MAXIMUM EFFECT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN OUR VIEW, THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE CONVENTION - WHICH </p><p>HAS BEEN GENERALLY RECOGNISED AS AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENT AND </p><p>REMEDY - WILL DEPEND ON MORE STRENUOUS EFFORTS BY THE </p><p>CONTRACTING STATES TO CO-OPERATE AND VIGOROUSLY IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE PRACTICAL STEPS WHICH IN OUR </p><p>VIEW ARE CRITICAL TO THE EFFECTIVE AND SMOOTH OPERATION OF </p><p>THE CONVENTION; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.     THE DISSEMINATION OF BEST PRACTICES AND CASE LAW OF </p><p>THE SIXTY CONTRACTING STATES; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.     THE COLLECTION AND PUBLICATION OF COMPARABLE DATA </p><p>CONCERNING KEY ASPECTS OF PERFORMANCE, RELATING, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>TO ENFORCEMENT AND DELAYS; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3     TRAINING PROGRAMS, BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL, FOR </p><p>JUDGES, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND OTHERS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.     REGULAR REVIEWS AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL OF THE </p><p>OPERATION OF THE CONVENTION, AT WHICH STATES PARTIES HAVE THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY BOTH TO HIGHLIGHT POOR PERFORMANCE AND TO SHARE </p><p>EXAMPLES OF GOOD PRACTICE, AS WELL AS TO CONSIDER THE NEED </p><p>FOR ADDITIONAL CONCERTED ACTION; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.     THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSNATIONAL MECHANISMS FOR </p><p>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION, INCLUDING MEDIATION; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.     INCREASED FOCUS ON ACCESS RIGHTS BETWEEN CHILDREN AND </p><p>BOTH PARENTS, THROUGH RATIFICATION OF EXISTING CONVENTIONS, </p><p>IN PARTICULAR THE 1996 HAGUE CONVENTION ON THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PROTECTION OF CHILDREN, AND THE POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW </p><p>INSTRUMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE PERMANENT BUREAU OF THE HAGUE CONFERENCE HAS BEEN MAKING, </p><p>WITHIN THE RESTRAINTS OF LIMITED RESOURCES, STRENUOUS EFFORTS </p><p>OVER MANY YEARS ON ALL OF THESE FRONTS (THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT </p><p>PROVIDES FURTHER DETAILS).  FOR EXAMPLE, WE LAUNCHED ON 9 MAY </p><p>2000 AN ELECTRONIC INTERNATIONAL DATABASE OF JUDICIAL </p><p>DECISIONS CONCERNING THE CONVENTION (HTTP://WWW.INCADAT.COM); </p><p>WE ORGANISED IN 1998 AND EARLY THIS WEEK A THREE-DAY SEMINAR </p><p>FOR FORTY JUDGES, EACH TIME FROM DIFFERENT CONTRACTING STATES </p><p>TO FAMILIARISE THEM WITH THE CONVENTION AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO </p><p>CO-OPERATE ACROSS BORDERS; AND WE ARE CURRENTLY PREPARING FOR </p><p>A FOURTH MAJOR MEETING OF CONTRACTING STATES TO TAKE PLACE IN </p><p>MARCH 2001, FROM WHICH WE EXPECT TO SEE A NUMBER OF </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS EMERGING ON THE APPLICATION OF THE 1980 </p><p>CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE PERMANENT BUREAU IS GLAD TO OFFER ITS EXPERTISE, AND ITS </p><p>PREMISES AT THE HAGUE TO FACILITATE THE WORK OF THE JOINT </p><p>EXPERTS GROUP REFERRED TO ABOVE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HAGUE </p><p>CONFERENCE PROVIDES AN OBJECTIVE AND TRUSTED FORUM FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION TO MAKE THE 1980 CONVENTION WORK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WE WOULD ALSO HOPE THAT THE EXPERTS GROUP WOULD, AS PART OF </p><p>THE REPORTED "ORGANISATIONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSEQUENCES </p><p>TO BE TAKEN", REFLECT ON WAYS TO REINFORCE THE CAPACITY OF </p><p>THE PERMANENT BUREAU SO AS TO ENABLE US TO DO ALL THAT WE </p><p>KNOW IS NEEDED TO GIVE THE CONVENTION THE BEST POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>WORKING EFFECTIVELY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YOURS SINCERELY, </p><p>/S/ </p><p>HANS VAN LOON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>//END TEXT OF LETTER// </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE LETTER HAS BEEN FAXED TO THE DEPARTMENT (L/PIL - </p><p>KOVAR). </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
