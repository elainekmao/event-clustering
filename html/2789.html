<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000771 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PHUM, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: TWO DEAD IN RASH OF CAPITAL BOMBINGS; MAOISTS </p><p>CALL FOR "INDEFINITE BANDH" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  A string of seven Maoist attacks across </p><p>the Kathmandu valley April 17-18 killed two and wounded </p><p>eight.  Maoists attacked three street-side police posts, </p><p>in one case killing one officer and one civilian by- </p><p>stander.  Attacks on government offices and the home of an </p><p>advisor to the Prime Minister were also reported.  In an </p><p>April 15 statement, Maoist leader Prachanda threatened an </p><p>"indefinite" general strike following the one called for </p><p>April 23-27.  Experience shows that once made, Prachanda\'s </p><p>statements are difficult to retract.  The wave of violence </p><p>is an attempt to intimidate Kathmandu\'s residents into </p><p>observing the Maoists\' strike.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Bomb in Capital Kills Two </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) A bomb thrown at a police stand on a busy </p><p>thoroughfare in Kathmandu April 17 killed two, according </p><p>to police sources.  At around 8:00 p.m. local time, Maoist </p><p>insurgents threw an improvised explosive device made from </p><p>a pressure cooker at the small police stand.  They then </p><p>fired on officers with pistols.  One policeman died at the </p><p>scene; another remains in serious condition.  Shrapnel </p><p>from the blast wounded three passers-by, one fatally. </p><p> </p><p>Five More Injured in Similar Morning Incident </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Between 5:30 and 6:30 a.m. local time, Maoists </p><p>attacked a half-dozen locations around the Kathmandu </p><p>valley.  In an incident similar to the April 17 bombing, a </p><p>petrol bomb was thrown at a small police stand on a busy </p><p>street in Gattekulo, near the Kathmandu\'s Maitidevi </p><p>neighborhood.  Two police and three passers-by were </p><p>injured, police related to Post.  [Note:  A Reuters wire </p><p>story erroneously reported six wounded, including four </p><p>members of the public.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>But No Other Injuries or Fatalities </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) No other injuries or fatalities were reported in </p><p>the hour\'s five other incidents.  The incidents occurred </p><p>in disparate locations in and around Kathmandu, and all </p><p>involved Molotov-cocktail-style attacks.  Targets included </p><p>another police stand; a Health Department vehicle; an </p><p>Education Office; a Village District Committee building; </p><p>and the home of the economics advisor to Prime Minister </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba.  The advisor, Dr. Prakash Saran Mahat, </p><p>was in New Delhi at the time.  Fire caused significant </p><p>damage to downstairs rooms, but no one was harmed, Mahat </p><p>told us. </p><p> </p><p>Chinese Worker Ambushed </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) A Chinese contractor on a hydroelectric project was </p><p>injured when Maoists ambushed his vehicle April 17 in </p><p>Sindhupalchowk district north of the capital. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Leader Threatens "Indefinite Bandh" </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) In an April 15 press release, Maoist leader </p><p>Prachanda stated that "there is a need of not only the </p><p>five-day bandh (general strike) but also of an indefinite </p><p>Nepal bandh until there is no way out."  The statement </p><p>continues, "the dream of the feudal tyrants, who like to </p><p>keep the great Nepali people as the slaves of the Middle </p><p>Ages by frightening them with the names of America, the UK </p><p>and India, will never be fulfilled."  [Note:  Post\'s </p><p>translation of the April 15 statement has been forwarded </p><p>to SA/INS.] </p><p> </p><p>Flight Diverted Due to Maoist Attack </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) A Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) flight to </p><p>Humla district in western Nepal was diverted to Nepalgunj </p><p>after Maoists fired and threw bombs at the Simikot </p><p>airport.  A newspaper correspondent for Kantipur, Nepal\'s </p><p>leading vernacular daily, reported the story from Simikot, </p><p>Humla\'s district capital.  No one was injured, and the </p><p>plane was undamaged, according to a press report.  Reached </p><p>after hours, civil aviation authorities and the RNAC </p><p>office at Kathmandu\'s international airport could not </p><p>confirm the story. </p><p> </p><p>Post Response </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Conoff is preparing a public announcement for CA </p><p>clearance.  Post will hold a warden meeting for American </p><p>citizens April 19.  An EAC meeting will be held April 19, </p><p>and another on April 22. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Saying and Making It So </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Maoists have raised the stakes considerably </p><p>by threatening an "indefinite" bandh.  As the aborted </p><p>April 2-6 bandh showed, Prachanda has difficulty </p><p>retracting his statements once they are in circulation. </p><p>As in the past, in response to Prachanda\'s calls for a </p><p>general strike April 23-27, Maoist cadres have ratcheted </p><p>up the violence in order to intimidate urban residents </p><p>into staying home.  Also as in the past, government </p><p>facilities and officials were the targets of this most </p><p>recent wave of attacks - although their increasingly </p><p>indiscriminate execution have again killed and wounded </p><p>innocent by-standers. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
