FAULK FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 15, THE EMBASSY RECEIVED AN URGENT </p><p>MESSAGE FROM AMERICAN FARMER MITZI CARRUTHERS, WHO, WITH </p><p>HER ZIMBABWEAN HUSBAND BRUCE, WORKS A SIZABLE FARM 20 KM </p><p>OUTSIDE OF BINDURA TOWN.  THEY DO NOT OWN THE PROPERTY, </p><p>BUT LEASE IT FROM A ZIMBABWEAN WHO HAS SINCE RELOCATED </p><p>TO AUSTRALIA.  THE FARM HAD BEEN VISITED THAT DAY BY A </p><p>TECHNICAL TEAM FROM THE AGRITEX PARASTATAL BELONGING TO </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF LANDS AND AGRICULTURE.  AS NEITHER SHE </p><p>NOR HER HUSBAND WERE AT HOME, THE FARM MANAGER CONVINCED </p><p>THE TEAM TO RETURN THE NEXT DAY.  FEARING THEY WERE </p><p>ABOUT TO BE SERVED A SECTION 8 EVICTION NOTICE, MRS. </p><p>CARRUTHERS, AN EMBASSY WARDEN, CONTACTED THE EMBASSY </p><p>(SEE REFTEL FOR DETAILS ON SECTION 8 OF THE LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION ACT). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 16, POLOFF JOINED </p><p>MRS. CARRUTHERS AT HER FARM TO AWAIT THE RETURN OF THE </p><p>AGRITEX GROUP AND OBSERVE THE PROCEEDINGS.  THE GROUP, </p><p>COMPRISING TWO YOUNG WOMEN AND A MAN, SHOWED UP MORE </p><p>THAN AN HOUR LATE AND EXPLAINED THEY WERE JUST A </p><p>TECHNICAL TEAM THERE TO TAKE SOIL SAMPLES, MARK THE </p><p>PROPERTY BOUNDARY, AND ASSESS THE EXTENT OF THE FARM\'S </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE.  (NOTE: THE FARM OWNERS SOME TIME AGO </p><p>HAD BEEN SERVED A SECTION 5 NOTICE, WHICH NOTIFIES THE </p><p>OWNERS OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S INTENTION TO ACQUIRE THE </p><p>PROPERTY.  SURVEYING THE PROPERTY IS PERMISSIBLE UNDER </p><p>SECTION 5 OF THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT.  END NOTE.)  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03470  01 OF 02  200922Z </p><p>AGRITEX PEOPLE WERE LOW-KEY AND NON-CONFRONTATIONAL, AND </p><p>HAD ALL THE APPEARANCE AND DEMEANOR OF SUMMER INTERNS. </p><p>WHEN ASKED IF A SECTION 8 EVICTION NOTICE WAS SOON TO </p><p>FOLLOW, THE TEAM LEADER RESPONDED THAT A DIFFERENT </p><p>MINISTRY DEPARTMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND SHE DID </p><p>NOT KNOW WHAT THE DEPARTMENT INTENDED TO DO.  THE TEAM </p><p>CARRIED OUT ITS ONE-HOUR SURVEY WITHOUT INCIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MRS. CARRUTHERS TOLD POLOFF THAT THIS WAS THE </p><p>FIRST TIME HER FARM HAD BEEN VISITED BY THE LANDS </p><p>MINISTRY.  SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAVE BEEN VERY LUCKY AND </p><p>HAVE NOT HAD SQUATTERS OR WAR VETERANS ON THE FARM SINCE </p><p>THE TROUBLE BEGAN LAST YEAR.  SHE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT A </p><p>FEW MONTHS AGO THE MAYOR OF BINDURA APPEARED ON THE FARM </p><p>IN AN APPARENT SCOUTING MISSION FOR A PROPERTY THAT WAS </p><p>CLOSER TO TOWN.  THE MAYOR\'S FARM NEAR SHAMVA WAS TOO </p><p>FAR AWAY, HE REPORTEDLY TOLD THE FARM MANAGER.  MRS. </p><p>CARRUTHERS REPORTED THAT HER NEIGHBORS HAVE NOT BEEN SO </p><p>FORTUNATE.  MOST OF THEM HAVE OCCUPIERS WHO HAVE DENUDED </p><p>SURROUNDING FORESTS AND BUILT HUTS ON THE PROPERTIES </p><p>(POLOFF OBSERVED SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF THIS ON THE WAY </p><p>TO THE CARRUTHERS\' FARM).  THE BINDURA POLICE </p><p>COMMISSIONER EVEN BUILT A HUGE HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF A </p><p>NEIGHBOR\'S IRRIGATED FIELD, MRS. CARRUTHERS STATED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ALTHOUGH RELIEVED THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SERVED </p><p>A SECTION 8 NOTICE YET, THE CARRUTHERS STATED THEY ARE </p><p>WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE.  THEY ALREADY HAVE ZIM$1.5 </p><p>MILLION (APPROXIMATELY US$5,000) WORTH OF FERTILIZERS ON </p><p>FIELDS THAT ARE INTENDED TO GROW SOYBEANS.  THEY HAVE </p><p>PURCHASED THE SEED, THEIR WORKERS HAVE PLOWED THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03470  01 OF 02  200922Z </p><p>FIELDS, AND AN EXPENSIVE IRRIGATION SYSTEM IS INSTALLED </p><p>AND READY FOR USE, THEY REPORTED.  THEY ARE APPREHENSIVE </p><p>ABOUT PLANTING -- FEARFUL THAT THEIR CROPS WILL BE </p><p>PLOWED OVER BY SQUATTERS OR UNSCRUPULOUS LOCAL OFFICIALS </p><p>OR THAT THEY WON\'T EVEN BE AROUND TO HARVEST IN A FEW </p><p>MONTHS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THEY DON\'T PLANT SOON, </p><p>THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WILL HAVE WASTED MILLIONS OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE DOLLARS AND WON\'T HAVE ANY WAY TO RECOVER IT. </p><p>IN A FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATION NOVEMBER 19, BRUCE </p><p>CARRUTHERS REPORTED THAT THE AGRITEX PEOPLE HAD NOT </p><p>RETURNED TO THE FARM AS PROMISED.  HE AND HIS WIFE ARE </p><p>PLANNING TO JOIN A COLLECTIVE APPEAL BY LOCAL FARMERS TO </p><p>THE DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR TO </p><p>SAVE THEIR LAND.  INDIVIDUAL APPEALS HAVE HAD LITTLE </p><p>EFFECT IN THE PAST, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: IT IS PROBABLY NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT </p><p>THE LANDS MINISTRY DECIDED TO SURVEY THE CARRUTHERS FARM </p><p>LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER PRESIDENT MUGABE AMENDED THE LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION ACT TO PERMIT THE OUTRIGHT NATIONALIZATION </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE\'S COMMERCIAL FARMS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>EVIDENTLY REDOUBLING ITS EFFORTS TO SEIZE MOST WHITE- </p><p>OWNED PROPERTY BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DUE BY </p><p>MARCH 2002.
