<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001590 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/ETC, EB/ATT/BTT, AF/EOS </p><p>USDA FOR FAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, SENV, TBIO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT OAU DRAFT BIOSAFETY </p><p>LAW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 101886 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) EconOff met July 2 with the Director of the National </p><p>Biotechnology Program, Professor C. Omaliko, to discuss, per </p><p>reftel, the OAU Draft Biosafety Law adopted by a technical </p><p>committee May 2-5 in Addis Ababa.  The National Biotechnology </p><p>Program falls under the aegis of the Federal Ministry of </p><p>Science and Technology.  According to Omaliko, reftel </p><p>information sent to the Ministry on June 27 came as a </p><p>surprise.  He expressed outrage that the draft law had not </p><p>been brought to his Ministry\'s attention by the Nigerian </p><p>delegation to Addis Ababa.  Omaliko noted that despite joint </p><p>responsibility for the issue, only the Ministries of </p><p>Environment and Foreign Affairs were represented at the OAU </p><p>meeting in May. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Omaliko thanked EconOff for sending reftel information </p><p>"in time to halt Nigeria\'s endorsement of the draft law."  He </p><p>said, "No way should Nigeria agree to this law. It is not in </p><p>our national interest." Once he had received the information, </p><p>Omaliko said, he met with Minister of Science and Technology </p><p>Turner Isoun to discuss strategy and started drafting a memo </p><p>to President Obasanjo that lays out the Ministry\'s objections </p><p>to the OAU Draft Biosafety Law.  Paging through the draft, </p><p>Omaliko pointed out several of these objections.  First, the </p><p>risk assessment definitions contained in the draft law are </p><p>far too broad.  Second, the draft sets no time limit on </p><p>making decisions for or against GMOs and any decision, </p><p>according to the law, would be provisional. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Omaliko explained that Nigeria is the first African </p><p>country to have a national biosafety protocol. (The protocol </p><p>is awaiting final approval by the Executive Council </p><p>(equivalent of the U.S. Cabinet).)  He noted that </p><p>biotechnology is one of Minister Isoun\'s top two priorities </p><p>and is supported by President Obasanjo.  Omaliko said that </p><p>his memo to the President, which he would complete that same </p><p>day, would recommend that Nigeria halt discussions within the </p><p>OAU regarding biosafety until the GON has reached internal </p><p>consensus on the issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Omaliko went on to explain that the GON is in touch </p><p>with U.S. biotech company Monsanto and that he had personally </p><p>set up a GON trade mission to the U.S. earlier this year to </p><p>meet with company representatives and USDA and EPA to discuss </p><p>regulatory issues.  Omaliko commented that Monsanto </p><p>representatives from South Africa would be in Abuja next week </p><p>to meet with the Ministers of Agriculture and Science and </p><p>Technology to discuss further areas for collaboration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Comment.  The position of the Ministry of Science and </p><p>Technology is to promote the development of the biotech </p><p>industry in Nigeria as demonstrated by existing and </p><p>continuing support for several biotechnology research </p><p>centers, with particular focus on agricultural products. </p><p>However, the position of the Ministry of Environment, </p><p>particularly the perspective of Deputy Minister Okopido, is </p><p>in support of strident biosafety legislation.  At this </p><p>juncture, it is likely that the voice of caution from the </p><p>Ministry of Science and Technology will prevail regarding the </p><p>OAU Draft Biosafety Law.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
