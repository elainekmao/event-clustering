(SBU) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER OF 14 JANUARY SEEKING THE ADVICE </p><p>OF THE WTO REGARDING HOW WFP SHOULD HANDLE DONATIONS OF </p><p>GM/BIOTECH FOODS.  I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN OUR VIEWS </p><p>ON THIS HIGHLY SENSITIVE MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>THE WTO HAS NO AGREEMENTS EXPLICITLY RELATING TO TRADE IN </p><p>GM/BIOTECH FOODS, NOR HAVE THERE BEEN ANY FORMAL LEGAL </p><p>INTERPRETATIONS OR DECISIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF </p><p>WTO AGREEMENTS TO SUCH TRADE.  FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION REGARDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRADE </p><p>IN GM/BIOTECH FOODS, NO MEETINGS HAVE BEEN HELD UNDER THE </p><p>AUSPICES OF THE WTO TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER.  THEREFORE, MY </p><p>RESPONSE TO YOU IS SOLELY AS THE HEAD OF THE WTO </p><p>SECRETARIAT, AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE VIEWS OF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OUR MEMBER GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE SEVERAL WTO AGREEMENTS WHICH MAY HAVE SOME </p><p>RELEVANCE FOR TRADE IN GM/BIOTECH FOODS, IN PARTICULAR THE </p><p>AGREEMENT ON THE APPLICATION OF SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY </p><p>MEASURES (THE "SPS AGREEMENT"), THE AGREEMENT ON TECHNICAL </p><p>BARRIERS TO TRADE (THE "TBT AGREEMENT"), AND THE GENERAL </p><p>AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE 1994 (THE "GATT").  THE </p><p>AGREEMENT ON TRADE-RELATED ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY </p><p>RIGHTS (THE "TRIPS AGREEMENT") MAY APPLY TO THE ISSUE OF </p><p>PATENT PROTECTION FOR GM/BIOTECH PRODUCTS, BUT IS PROBABLY </p><p>NOT RELEVANT WITH REGARD TO FOOD AID. </p><p> </p><p>THE SPS AGREEMENT RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF ANY WTO MEMBER </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO RESTRICT TRADE WHEN NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00395  01 OF 04  010828Z </p><p>PROTECTION OF HEALTH, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

(SBU) SUMMARY.  MISSION HAS BEEN PROVIDED A COPY OF </p><p>CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE UN </p><p>WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL PANITCHPAKDI IN WHICH PANITCHPAKDI IS ASKED </p><p>TO PROVIDE VIEWS ON THE HOW WFP SHOULD HANDLE BIOTECH </p><p>ENGINEERED FOOD AID. PANITCHPAKDI CONCLUDES THAT </p><p>CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT WFP POLICY (ALLOWING EACH </p><p>COUNTRY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT BIOTECH FOOD) IS </p><p>THE MOST "PRAGMATIC" OPTION. PANITCHPAKDI DOES NOT SUPPORT </p><p>THE RECOMMENDATION OF CERTAIN EU WFP EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS </p><p>(REFTEL) THAT WFP IMPLEMENT "ADVANCE INFORMED AGREEMENT" </p><p>PRIOR TO ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL. US </p><p>MISSION STRONGLY SUPPORTS WTO\'S "QUIET ADVICE" THAT WFP </p><p>STICK WITH ITS PRESENT GM-FOOD AID POLICY. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>FULL TEXT OF LETTER FROM WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL PANITCHPAKDI TO WFP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR </p><p>MORRIS DATED JANUARY 23, 2003 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00395  01 OF 04  010828Z </p><p>2. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER OF 14 JANUARY SEEKING THE ADVICE </p><p>OF THE WTO REGARDING HOW WFP SHOULD HANDLE DONATIONS OF </p><p>GM/BIOTECH FOODS.  I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN OUR VIEWS </p><p>ON THIS HIGHLY SENSITIVE MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>THE WTO HAS NO AGREEMENTS EXPLICITLY RELATING TO TRADE IN </p><p>GM/BIOTECH FOODS, NOR HAVE THERE BEEN ANY FORMAL LEGAL </p><p>INTERPRETATIONS OR DECISIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF </p><p>WTO AGREEMENTS TO SUCH TRADE.  FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION REGARDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRADE </p><p>IN GM/BIOTECH FOODS, NO MEETINGS HAVE BEEN HELD UNDER THE </p><p>AUSPICES OF THE WTO TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER.  THEREFORE, MY </p><p>RESPONSE TO YOU IS SOLELY AS THE HEAD OF THE WTO </p><p>SECRETARIAT, AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE VIEWS OF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OUR MEMBER GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE SEVERAL WTO AGREEMENTS WHICH MAY HAVE SOME </p><p>RELEVANCE FOR TRADE IN GM/BIOTECH FOODS, IN PARTICULAR THE </p><p>AGREEMENT ON THE APPLICATION OF SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY </p><p>MEASURES (THE "SPS AGREEMENT"), THE AGREEMENT ON TECHNICAL </p><p>BARRIERS TO TRADE (THE "TBT AGREEMENT"), AND THE GENERAL </p><p>AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE 1994 (THE "GATT").  THE </p><p>AGREEMENT ON TRADE-RELATED ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY </p><p>RIGHTS (THE "TRIPS AGREEMENT") MAY APPLY TO THE ISSUE OF </p><p>PATENT PROTECTION FOR GM/BIOTECH PRODUCTS, BUT IS PROBABLY </p><p>NOT RELEVANT WITH REGARD TO FOOD AID. </p><p> </p><p>THE SPS AGREEMENT RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF ANY WTO MEMBER </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO RESTRICT TRADE WHEN NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00395  01 OF 04  010828Z </p><p>PROTECTION OF HEALTH, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THIS </p><p>AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND </p><p>ANIMAL HEALTH FROM RISKS "ARISING FROM ADDITIVES, </p><p>CONTAMINANTS, TOXINS OR DISEASE-CAUSING ORGANISMS" IN FOODS, </p><p>BEVERAGES OR FEEDSTUFFS; THE PROTECTION OF PLANT AND ANIMAL </p><p>HEALTH FROM PESTS OR DISEASES; AND THE PROTECTION OF THE </p><p>TERRITORY OF A COUNTRY FROM THE ENTRY, ESTABLISHMENT OR </p><p>SPREAD OF PESTS. THIS LATTER RUBRIC WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS </p><p>CONCERNS OF INVASIVE SPECIES "CROWDING OUT" NATIVE SPECIES </p><p>OR OTHERWISE CAUSING DAMAGES, A CONCERN WHICH MAY BE </p><p>APPLICABLE WITH RESPECT TO SOME LIVING MODIFIED ORGANISMS. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE SPS AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE TRADE-RESTRICTING </p><p>MEASURES ARE BASED ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, AND IN PARTICULAR </p><p>ON A RISK ASSESSMENT, GOVERNMENTS ARE PERMITTED TO TAKE </p><p>PROVISIONAL MEASURES IN CASES WHERE THERE IS INSUFFICIENT </p><p>SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>THE SPS AGREEMENT ENCOURAGES GOVERNMENTS TO BASE THEIR </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00395 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
