SUMMARY: THE FAO FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEES MET </p><p>AT FAO HEADQUARTERS IN ROME SEPTEMBER 9-13, 2002.  THE </p><p>MAIN TOPIC IN THE JOINT SESSION WAS THE MEDIUM TERM PLAN </p><p>(MTP) 2004-09 AND PRIORITIZATION OF RESOURCES.  THE </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL MADE A STRONG BID FOR INCREASED </p><p>RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE OBJECTIVES ENDORSED AT THE </p><p>WORLD FOOD SUMMIT:FIVE YEARS LATER MEETING LAST JUNE, A </p><p>BID MOST DONORS CONSIDERED UNREALISTIC.  CANADA SPARKED </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH AN OFFER, WHICH WAS DECLINED, TO HIRE AN </p><p>EXPERT GROUP OF CONSULTANTS TO SET PRIORITIES FOR THE </p><p>FAO. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SPLIT ALONG </p><p>PREDICTABLE NORTH/SOUTH LINES IN SUPPORT FOR INCREASES IN </p><p>THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS CONTAINED IN THE MEDIUM TERM PLAN. </p><p>CAIRNS GROUP PROGRAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS TOOK THE LEAD IN A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO BOLSTER SUPPORT FOR THE PLANT-HEALTH </p><p>STANDARD SETTING ACTIVITIES OF THE INTERNATIONAL PLANT </p><p>PROTECTION CONVENTION (IPPC). </p><p> </p><p>  3.  THE FINANCE COMMITTEE, OF WHICH THE UNITED STATES </p><p>IS A MEMBER, DWELT ON THE CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN </p><p>FAO\'S FINANCES. THE FAO MAY BE FORCED TO BORROW </p><p>EXTERNALLY BY YEAREND IF U.S. ARREARS ARE NOT REDUCED </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY.  THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC WAS THE </p><p>REPORT PRESENTED BY THE OUTGOING EXTERNAL AUDITOR WHICH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04561  01 OF 04  201017Z </p><p>CONTAINED SHARP CRITICISM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.  FINALLY, </p><p>FAO WILL PUSH FOR ADOPTION OF ITS SPLIT ASSESSMENT SCHEME </p><p>(USD/EUROS) BY THE NEXT CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEES ARE TENTATIVELY </p><p>SCHEDULED TO MEET AGAIN MAY 5-9, 2003.  THE FINANCE </p><p>COMMITTEE WILL MEET IN AN ADDITIONAL, EXTRAORDINARY </p><p>SESSION OCTOBER 7-8, 2002 TO REVIEW THE WORLD FOOD </p><p>PROGRAM\'S AUDITED ACCOUNTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEES DONE BY REGION </p><p>  -------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEES ARE COMPOSED OF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH REGIONAL GROUP OF MEMBER STATES. </p><p>THE FINANCE COMMITTEE (NINE MEMBERS) WAS CHAIRED BY CHILE </p><p>AND INCLUDED, IN ADDITION TO THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF JAPAN, KUWAIT, PAKISTAN, SENEGAL, </p><p>SWITZERLAND, TANZANIA, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.  THE </p><p>PROGRAM COMMITTEE (ELEVEN MEMBERS) WAS CHAIRED BY THE </p><p>DUTCH PERMREP AND INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF AUSTRALIA, </p><p>CAMEROON, CANADA, CHINA, COLOMBIA, LEBANON, MALAYSIA, </p><p>MALI, PARAGUAY AND SUDAN.  MEMBERS ARE ELECTED BY THE </p><p>CONFERENCE FOR TWO-YEAR TERMS, AND THIS WAS THE SECOND </p><p>MEETING FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.   DIRECTOR GENERAL CALLS FOR MORE RESOURCES TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE "INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>THE DIRECTOR GENERAL TOLD THE JOINT COMMITTEE THAT THE </p><p>FAO FINDS ITSELF IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION: MEMBERS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04561  01 OF 04  201017Z </p><p>STATES ACROSS THE BOARD WANT THE FAO TO DO MORE, BUT THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION HAS NOT BEEN GRANTED INCREASED RESOURCES TO </p><p>CARRY OUT ITS BROADER MANDATE.  THIS CREATES A ZERO SUM </p><p>GAME; FAO MUST TAKE FUNDS FROM ONE ACTIVITY TO SUPPORT AN </p><p>INCREASE IN ANOTHER.  HE ASKED FOR GREATER UNDERSTANDING. </p><p> </p><p>THE DIRECTOR GENERAL ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE </p><p>FAO\'S FINANCIAL SITUATION.  HE BLAMED U.S. ARREARS FOR </p><p>CAUSING A CASH FLOW CRISIS.  IN ADDITION TO MORE THAN USD </p><p>95 MILLION IN ARREARS, THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY PAYS </p><p>ITS ASSESSMENT IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE YEAR (ALTHOUGH </p><p>IT IS DUE IN FULL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.)  HE SAID </p><p>THERE WERE NO FUNDS FOR $14 MILLION IN ANNUAL AFTER </p><p>SERVICE MEDICAL COSTS AMONG OTHER STAFF RELATED EXPENSES. </p><p>IF THE FAO WERE TO SPEND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TECHNICAL </p><p>COOPERATION PROGRAM (TCP) MORE RAPIDLY AS URGED, IT WOULD </p><p>BE BANKRUPT.  HE URGED ADOPTION OF THE SPLIT ASSESSMENT </p><p>SCHEME (EUROS AND U.S. DOLLARS) TO REDUCE THE FOREIGN </p><p>EXCHANGE RISK ASSUMED BY THE FAO. </p><p> </p><p>THE DIRECTOR GENERAL ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE SHARP </p><p>CRITICISM LEVIED BY THE EXTERNAL AUDITORS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>REGARDING INTERNAL CONTROLS.  FAO HAS ACCEPTED VIRTUALLY </p><p>ALL OF THE AUDITORS\' RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROVIDED THE </p><p>FINANCE COMMITTEE WITH AN ACTION PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4137 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04561  02 OF 04  201017Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  MEDE-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  FMP-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------EA41A3  201017Z /38 </p><p>R 200952Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5914 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2286 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 004561 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION TO UN AGENCIES IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA AND IO/S </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/HUGHES AND REICH </p><p>USDA FOR APHIS/GREIFER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO, VIENNA FOR UNVIE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04561  02 OF 04  201017Z </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAGR, EAID, EFIN, KUNR, WFPO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEES CONSIDER </p><p>MEDIUM TERM PLAN FOR 2004-09 </p><p> </p><p>THE ONLY RECOMMENDATIONS REJECTED CONCERNED INCREASED </p><p>STAFF, FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO FUNDING, AND MERGING </p><p>INTERNAL CONTROLS (AUD) WITH EVALUATIONS (PBEE). </p><p> </p><p>HE ALSO DEFENDED HIS MANAGEMENT OF THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>FINANCES.  IN REVIEWING PAST HISTORY, HE SAID HE HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN GIVEN THE RESOURCES HE NEEDED TO CHANGE THE </p><p>FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEM.  IN FACT, THE OVERALL LEVEL </p><p>OF THE BUDGET HAD BEEN CUT SHORTLY AFTER HE TOOK OFFICE </p><p>IN 1994.  DESPITE THESE OBSTACLES, HE TOOK PRIDE IN THE </p><p>FACT THAT FAO\'S ACCOUNTS HAD BEEN CONSISTENTLY APPROVED </p><p>EVERY BIENNIUM WITHOUT ANY RESERVATIONS BY THE EXTERNAL </p><p>AUDITORS. </p><p> </p><p>IN CONCLUSION, HE ASSERTED HE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT MEETING LAST JUNE.  IT </p><p>HAD RAISED AWARENESS OF HUNGER PROBLEMS AND FORGED NEW </p><p>PARTNERSHIPS.  HE WAS ALSO ENCOURAGED BY SIGNS OF </p><p>REVERSAL IN THE LONG DOWNWARD TREND IN RESOURCES DEVOTED </p><p>TO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY FROM DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES.  HE ASKED FOR THE MEMBERSHIP\'S INCREASED </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR FAO. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE MEDIUM TERM PLAN (MTP) 2004-09 RENEWS FAO\'S </p><p>REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04561  02 OF 04  201017Z </p><p>THIS DISCUSSION MARKED THE KICK-OFF OF THE BUDGET BATTLE. </p><p>US PERMREP STATED THE U.S. POSITION WAS STILL TO SUPPORT </p><p>ZERO NOMINAL GROWTH (ZNG) NOTING WE HAD ABSTAINED ON </p><p>ADOPTION OF A ZERO REAL GROWTH BUDGET (ZRG) AT THE FAO </p><p>CONFERENCE LAST NOVEMBER.  JAPAN JOINED THE US POSITION. </p><p>(COMMENT - THE EU WAFFLED DUE TO LACK OF CONSENSUS ON A </p><p>SINGLE POSITION, BUT GERMANY, NOT PRESENT IN THE FINANCE </p><p>OR PROGRAM COMMITTEES, IS LIKELY TO SUPPORT US AS WELL - </p><p>END COMMENT).  THE LATIN AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE, CHILE, </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE ADVERSE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT WILL </p><p>BEAR ON INCREASING THE BUDGET.  HE TOLD THE U.S. PERMREP </p><p>PRIVATELY THAT ARGENTINA WOULD SEEK AN ADJUSTMENT OF ITS </p><p>ASSESSMENT DUE TO ITS ECONOMIC REVERSAL.  AS IN THE LAST </p><p>BUDGET ROUND, SEVERAL MEMBERS CALLED ON THE SECRETARIAT </p><p>TO PRODUCE MORE THAN ONE BUDGET SCENARIO TO FACILITATE </p><p>MORE REALISTIC PLANNING. </p><p> </p><p>CANADA SPARKED A LIVELY DISCUSSION IN THE JOINT COMMITTEE </p><p>ON PRIORITIZATION WITHIN AGREED BUDGET LEVELS.  CANADA </p><p>OFFERED TO PAY FOR A GROUP OF EXTERNAL EXPERTS TO </p><p>EVALUATE THE MTP AND PROPOSE REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. </p><p>THIS WOULD AVOID UNFORESEEN SHIFTS IN RESOURCES FROM THE </p><p>REAL GROWTH BUDGET ADVOCATED BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL IF </p><p>THE AGREED LEVEL, AS PAST EXPERIENCE SHOWS, WERE TO BE </p><p>MUCH LOWER.  IT WOULD ALSO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>INCREASING MEMBER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE PROCESS IN </p><p>THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNING BODIES AND THE FAO </p><p>SECRETARIAT. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>MEMBERS\' OPINIONS ON PRIORITIZATION SPLIT ALONG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04561  02 OF 04  201017Z </p><p>PREDICTABLE NORTH/SOUTH LINES.

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES </p><p>SUPPORTED THE NEARLY 35 PERCENT INCREASE PROPOSED FOR THE </p><p>TECHNICAL COOPERATION PROGRAM (TCP), FAO COUNTRY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY </p><p>(SPFS). OECD COUNTRIES SPOKE ON BEHALF OF THE NORMATIVE </p><p>PROGRAMS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND SUPPORTED INCREASES FOR </p><p>FISHERIES AND FORESTRY.  MANY, INCLUDING THE UNITED </p><p>STATES, WERE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT INSUFFICIENT </p><p>RESOURCES FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PLANT PROTECTION </p><p>COMMISSION (IPPC).  AT CURRENT RESOURCE LEVELS EVEN </p><p>PLANNED ACTIVITIES CANNOT TAKE PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  FAO\'S FINANCIAL CRISIS COULD RESULT IN EXTERNAL </p><p>BORROWING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE DISCUSSION WAS ON THE EVER WEAKER </p><p>FINANCIAL POSITION OF FAO WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTED LARGELY TO </p><p>ARREARS OF THE "MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR."  THE U.S. TOOK THE </p><p>POSITION THAT THE GROWING DEFICIT WAS THE RESULT OF </p><p>EXPENDITURES EXCEEDING INCOME.  (THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR </p><p>NODDED IN AGREEMENT.)  THE U.S. PERMREP BRIEFED THE </p><p>COMMITTEE ON EFFORTS TO PAY ARREARS (INCLUDING THE </p><p>CURRENT YEAR ASSESSMENT WHICH WAS DUE JAN. 1, 2002) AND </p><p>AFFIRMED OUR GOAL TO PAY CURRENT YEAR DUES PLUS ARREARS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4139 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04561  03 OF 04  201017Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  MEDE-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  FMP-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------EA41B5  201018Z /38 </p><p>R 200952Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5915 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2287 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 004561 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION TO UN AGENCIES IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA AND IO/S </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/HUGHES AND REICH </p><p>USDA FOR APHIS/GREIFER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO, VIENNA FOR UNVIE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04561  03 OF 04  201017Z </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAGR, EAID, EFIN, KUNR, WFPO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEES CONSIDER </p><p>MEDIUM TERM PLAN FOR 2004-09 </p><p> </p><p>THIS CALENDAR YEAR.

EXTERNAL AUDITOR\'S REPORT SPURS FAO TO REACT WITH A </p><p>DETAILED ACTION PLAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>THE FAO HAS BEEN STUNG BY THE LENGTHY CRITICISM IN THE </p><p>EXTERNAL AUDITOR\'S REPORT.  FOR ONCE, RATHER THAN GET </p><p>DEFENSIVE, THEY HAVE TAKEN ACTION, ESPECIALLY TO IMPROVE </p><p>INTERNAL CONTROLS.  (COMMENT:  A TOP ADVISOR TO THE DG, </p><p>TOLD THE U.S. PERMREP THAT THE DG WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE </p><p>POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE REPORT ON PAYMENT OF U.S. </p><p>ARREARS. END COMMENT)  THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WILL NOT BE </p><p>EXTENDED AS HAS BEEN THE DG\'S ANNUAL PRACTICE FOR THE </p><p>LAST FIVE YEARS ALTHOUGH THE INCUMBENT HAD REACHED </p><p>MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE, AND THE POSITION HAS ALREADY </p><p>BEEN POSTED ON THE FAO WEBSITE.  THE FAO SECRETARIAT </p><p>PRESENTED THE ACTION PLAN CALLED FOR IN THE REPORT </p><p>ACCEPTING VIRTUALLY ALL THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR\'S </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS.  THIS INCLUDES CREATING AN AUDIT </p><p>COMMITTEE.  IN AN ATYPICAL ROLE REVERSAL, SENEGAL </p><p>QUESTIONED INCREMENTAL COSTS THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED BY </p><p>CREATION OF AN AUDIT COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES ALSO PRESENTED COMMENTS REGARDING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04561  03 OF 04  201017Z </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING ADMINISTRATION OF THE OIL </p><p>FOR FOOD PROGRAM IN IRAQ WHICH WERE WELL RECEIVED.  ONE </p><p>OF THE MAIN POINTS WAS THAT THE FAO MUST IMPROVE </p><p>EMERGENCY OPERATIONS IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE VIRTUALLY COLLAPSED, AS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  THE OIL FOR FOOD PROGRAM IS THE LARGEST </p><p>EVER ADMINISTERED BY THE FAO. </p><p> </p><p>10. SPLIT ASSESSMENT SCHEME PROPOSED TO AVOID FOREIGN </p><p>EXCHANGE LOSSES ESTIMATED TO REACH $35 MILLION 2004-05 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>THE FAO SECRETARIAT PRESSED FOR A DECISION ON THIS </p><p>"URGENT" MATTER ALTHOUGH IT WAS FOR DISCUSSION ONLY. THEY </p><p>PROJECTED THAT, AT CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES, THE FAO WOULD </p><p>BE IN THE HOLE $35 MILLION IF A ZNG BUDGET WERE APPROVED </p><p>FOR THE NEXT BIENNIUM.  THE EU COULD NOT EXPRESS AN </p><p>AGREED POSITION, BUT THE FRENCH ARE KNOWN TO BE STRONGLY </p><p>IN SUPPORT OF USING THE EURO.  SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES OF </p><p>G-77 COUNTRIES SPOKE IN FAVOR OF THE PLAN.  THE MATTER </p><p>WILL LIKELY BE RAISED AT THE FAO COUNCIL MEETING IN </p><p>OCTOBER/NOVEMBER TO ENABLE THE FAO TO PRESENT THE SCHEME </p><p>TO THE CONFERENCE IN 2003 FOR DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES WAS ISOLATED ON PROCEDURAL AND </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE GROUNDS.  WE ASKED FOR MORE INFORMATION ON </p><p>THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER UN AGENCIES, LIKE IAEA AND </p><p>UNESCO, WITH SPLIT ASSESSMENT SCHEMES.  WE ALSO REQUESTED </p><p>DATA ON THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION.  THE FAO POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY MEMBER WITH NO FXR </p><p>RISK AT PRESENT SINCE WE PAY OUR ASSESSMENT IN OUR </p><p>NATIONAL CURRENCY. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04561  03 OF 04  201017Z </p><p> </p><p>11.  PROGRESS REPORTED IN MANAGEMENT OF LONG TERM </p><p>INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ORACLE PROJECT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>ONE OF THE SOURCES OF CONTINUING LOSSES IN INCOME IS THE </p><p>FAO\'S LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  WHILE THIS IS </p><p>UNDERSTANDABLE IN THE CURRENT DOWNTURN IN GLOBAL </p><p>FINANCIAL MARKETS, FAO HAS SUSTAINED LOSSES THAT EXCEED </p><p>EVEN THE TARGETED LEVEL OF LOSSES.  THE EXTERNAL </p><p>AUDITOR\'S REPORT FOCUSED ON DEFICIENCIES IN THE TREASURY </p><p>DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS INTERNAL CONTROLS.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>FAO HAS MADE PROGRESS.  THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON </p><p>INVESTMENT MET LAST MAY AND OFFERED SOME ADVICE.  THE </p><p>PROPORTION OF EQUITIES IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS </p><p>BEEN REDUCED.  HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THAT THE GROWTH STRATEGY </p><p>OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS PHASE </p><p>OF THE MARKET.  FAO WAS ADVISED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE ACI </p><p>AND EXTERNAL AUDITOR\'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO SPLIT THE </p><p>PORTFOLIO BETWEEN MANAGERS WITH VALUE AND GROWTH ORIENTED </p><p>STRATEGIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE ORACLE PROJECT NOW SEEMS ON FIRM GROUND.

COMMENT </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE FAO TENDS TO BLAME THE "MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR," I.E. THE </p><p>UNITED STATES, FOR FAR TOO MANY OF ITS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04561  04 OF 04  201018Z </p><p>AND CONTINUES TO SPEND BEYOND WHAT IT CAN RATIONALLY </p><p>AFFORD.  THE DIRECTOR GENERAL, URGED ON BY POTENTIAL </p><p>BENEFICIARIES, CONTINUES TO PRESS FOR MORE RESOURCES FROM </p><p>DONORS THAN HE CAN REASONABLY EXPECT TO OBTAIN.  THE RISK </p><p>FOR DONORS IS THAT AS RESOURCES ARE SPREAD MORE THINLY, </p><p>NORMATIVE ACTIVITIES, LIKE IPPC, CAN BECOME IMPOVERISHED </p><p>AND LOSE CRITICAL MASS.  WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON </p><p>WHERE RESOURCES ARE USED AS WELL AS ON THE OVERALL BUDGET </p><p>LEVEL.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04561 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
