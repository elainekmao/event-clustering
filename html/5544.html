<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000111 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL/IRF, DRL/CRA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, SOCI, KIRF, VM, HUMANR, ETMIN, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT:  HCMC PASTORS: CHRISTMAS CELEBRATED WITHOUT </p><p>GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Despite a stream of reports from U.S. </p><p>sources proclaiming a new "crackdown" on Protestant </p><p>worshippers in the Central Highlands and elsewhere in </p><p>Vietnam over the Christmas holidays, conversations with well- </p><p>connected pastors in HCMC over the past weeks revealed </p><p>surprisingly few allegations of even harassment by the </p><p>government.  Instead, the pastors talked of growing numbers </p><p>of worshippers, new churches, and expansion of religious </p><p>training programs both here and abroad.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  During a dinner with several local religious </p><p>leaders from various Protestant denominations, none of these </p><p>pastors polled by Poloff was aware of any specific instances </p><p>of arrests, beatings, or interference with worship services </p><p>over the holidays.  All said they were able to celebrate the </p><p>holidays with their own congregations without incident, and </p><p>believed that others outside of HCMC had done so as well. </p><p>They spoke of hundreds of religious leaders currently </p><p>undergoing training here and overseas. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  One ethnic minority congregation leader did </p><p>complain of police searching his home and questioning him </p><p>just that morning.  However, he believed the incident to be </p><p>connected with a November trip to Tien Giang province, when </p><p>he was intercepted outside a "church" and detained briefly, </p><p>before being told to return to HCMC.  The authorities then </p><p>disbanded the assembled worshippers and confiscated a </p><p>variety of religious and secular items. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  In a separate, unrelated meeting, three Mennonite </p><p>pastors responded that they had not heard of any specific </p><p>examples of interference with Christmas services, but said </p><p>they might still receive additional information from the </p><p>provinces.  The pastors promised to arrange for direct </p><p>meetings with sources from the Central Highlands in the </p><p>future, rather than act as middlemen.  The pastors said the </p><p>Mennonites had recently sent religious workers to Gia Lai </p><p>and Dak Lak provinces to try to "rally" hundreds of house </p><p>churches that had "become scattered" over the past five </p><p>months.  Ethnic minority religious leaders, however, "seemed </p><p>scared."  Because this five-month time period would coincide </p><p>with reports of arrests in the Central Highlands during </p><p>August-September 2002, Poloff pressed for details. The </p><p>pastors, however, described the general climate of </p><p>harassment faced by all unregistered house churches. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The Mennonite pastors did provide Post with news </p><p>of the December 27 arrest of a missionary near HCMC, but no </p><p>details on why he was arrested.  Photographs show dozens of </p><p>people gathered around a police vehicle as uniformed </p><p>officers take the missionary into custody.  Later </p><p>photographs purport to show the missionary after he was </p><p>returned from custody beaten and unconscious.  The photos </p><p>depict him lying on the floor, with one of the pastors </p><p>standing over him with a clearly marked first aid kit.  The </p><p>missionary has since recovered, according to the pastor. </p><p>(Post note: To the untrained eye at least, the police in the </p><p>photos do not appear to be using excessive force.  Poloff </p><p>will try to follow up with the missionary directly.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  One of the pastors also provided photographic </p><p>evidence of a police search of his home in December.  These </p><p>photographs show uniformed police officers asking questions </p><p>and taking notes.  The pastor believes this incident might </p><p>have been related to his failed attempt to register as the </p><p>legal representative for three relatives of Father Ly, who </p><p>were detained in June 2001.  (Post note: Father Ly, who was </p><p>sentenced to a total of 15 years imprisonment for "damaging </p><p>national unity" in October 2001, remains a controversial </p><p>figure even within the Catholic Church here.)  The same </p><p>pastor also mentioned that he was working toward opening a </p><p>training center on law and human rights. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  According to the three Mennonite pastors, the GVN </p><p>continues to "watch and prohibit."  They claimed that two </p><p>other pastors who had returned from training in Thailand </p><p>late last year were apprehended by police and injected with </p><p>poison.  The two had subsequently "lost their memories" and </p><p>are currently under the care of their followers, being no </p><p>longer able to fulfill their pastoral duties.  (Post note: </p><p>Post will attempt to verify this story, as the pastors </p><p>acknowledged they were giving Poloff a second/third-hand </p><p>account.)  In an aside, the pastors said that "local </p><p>governments" in the Central Highlands had "opposed and </p><p>threatened" Deputy Prime Minister Dung during a recent visit </p><p>there. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The pastors had no statistics for what they </p><p>proudly described as a steadily growing number of </p><p>worshippers, but said there are 1500 Mennonite house </p><p>churches throughout the country.  The pastors are also </p><p>attempting to revive a Christian Boy Scout program in </p><p>Vietnam.  This program would be independent of any umbrella </p><p>organization, and, presumably, unrecognized here.  The </p><p>pastors are close to naming 12 troop leaders, including five </p><p>who had served in that capacity before the organization was </p><p>disbanded in 1975.  They cited great interest among members </p><p>of the Christian community. </p><p>9.  (SBU) Comment:  Post accepts that much of this </p><p>information is anecdotal.  The fact that some have been able </p><p>to worship peacefully does not mean all enjoy the same </p><p>opportunity, which is why we do not generalize about </p><p>religious practice in the Central Highlands.  Still, it is </p><p>noteworthy that none of these religious leaders (who have </p><p>been consistent sources of information critical of GVN human </p><p>rights violations in the past) complained of government </p><p>repression over the holidays.  This does not preclude the </p><p>possibility that additional information may surface later, </p><p>but offers a counterpoint to some of the more inflammatory </p><p>charges generated by other sources. </p><p> </p><p>Yamauchi </p><p></p></div>
