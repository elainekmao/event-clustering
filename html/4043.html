(SBU) SUMMARY: FIAT, ITALY\'S LARGET CORPORATION AND </p><p>NATIONAL ICON, IS IN THE MIDSTOF A POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING </p><p>CRISIS AS ITS SUBSIDIARY, FIAT AUTO, FACES TH CONSEQUENCES </p><p>OF DECADES OF MOUNTING LOSSES AND EBT. THE CRISIS OF FIAT </p><p>AUTO CRISIS IS HITTING IALY HARD ECONOMICALLY AND </p><p>POLITICALLY. LABOR IS P IN ARMS OVER POSSIBLE JOB CUTS THAT </p><p>COULD NUMBER IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS. THE POWERFUL AGNELLI </p><p>AMILY, WHICH OWNS THE FIAT EMPIRE, IS USING ITS INLUENCE TO </p><p>PRESSURE THE GOI. GENERAL MOTORS, WHICH OWNS TWENTY PERCENT </p><p>OF FIAT AUTO, IS WATCHING WARILY, AS FIAT\'S TROUBLES COULD </p><p>FORCE THE US AUTOMAKER TO UP ITS SHARE OF FIAT AUTO. THE GOI </p><p>FACES A VERY REAL POLITICAL -- AND ECONOMIC -- DILEMMA AS A </p><p>RESULT OF FIAT AUTO\'S FINANCIAL FREEFALL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FIAT AND NATIONALISM </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) FIAT AUTO WAS THE MODEL FOR ITALIAN POST-WAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05139  01 OF 04  221054Z </p><p>INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.  IT SPAWNED A CORPORATE EMPIRE </p><p>(IFIL), INCLUDING ALL COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY THE AGNELLI </p><p>FAMILY (FIAT AVIO, NEWS MEDIA, INSURANCE, AGRO-INDUSTRY, </p><p>CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, ALFA ROMEO, LANCIA, AND FERRARI, </p><p>PIAGGIO, ETC.).  IN THE 1960S, 20 PERCENT OF ALL ITALIAN </p><p>INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT IN SECTORS OTHER THAN THE AUTOMOTIVE </p><p>SECTOR, INCLUDING SUCH AS STEEL AND PLASTICS -- DEPENDED </p><p>DIRECTLY ON THE CORPORATE GIANT FIAT. IN 1964, AT THE END OF </p><p>ITALY\'S BOOM ECONOMIC YEARS, THE PRODUCTION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE </p><p>SECTOR, OF WHICH 90 PERCENT WAS FIAT\'S, ALONE ACCOUNTED FOR </p><p>3.5 PERCENT OF GDP AND TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTPUT OF THE </p><p>OVERALL INDUSTRIAL SECTOR.  TODAY, THE DIVERSIFIED FIAT </p><p>CORPORATION AND THE BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON IT REPRESENT AN </p><p>ESTIMATED FOUR PERCENT OF ITALY,S GDP.  FIAT AUTO ALONE </p><p>EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY 200,000 PEOPLE (36,000 IN ITS PLANTS), </p><p>MANY IN SOUTHERN ITALY. ALTHOUGH FIAT AUTO HAS EXPERIENCED </p><p>ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FOR DECADES, IT REMAINS A POTENT SYMBOL AND </p><p>DRIVER OF ITALY\'S ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) THE FIAT CORPORATION WAS FOUNDED IN 1899 BY GIOVANNI </p><p>AGNELLI (THE GRANDFATHER OF THE CURRENT HONORARY CHAIRMAN, </p><p>GIANNI AGNELLI). THE  AGNELLI FAMILY RETAINS OWNERSHIP AND </p><p>CONTROL. FROM THE FAMED CINQUECENTO CAR MODELS OF THE 1950S </p><p>TO THE SEICENTO OF THE 1960S, FIAT AUTO HAS LONG BEEN A </p><p>SOURCE OF NATIONAL PRIDE. HOWEVER TODAY, PUBLIC OPINION IS </p><p>DIVIDED ON THE QUESTION OF OWNERSHIP AND FATE OF FIAT AUTO. </p><p>SOME ITALIANS ARGUE THAT ITALY NEEDS TO MAINTAIN A </p><p>&NATIONAL8 AUTO INDUSTRY AT ALL COSTS TO PRESERVE ITS </p><p>NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PRESTIGE. OTHERS DO NOT FEEL ANY </p><p>ANTAGONISM TOWARD A FOREIGN BUY-OUT. MANY ITALIANS HAVE </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT FIAT AUTO IS NO LONGER A VIABLE FIRM: ITS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05139  01 OF 04  221054Z </p><p>PRODUCTION IS TOO SMALL TO COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY; DESIGNS </p><p>ARE NOT ADAPTED TO MARKET DESIRES, AND PRICES ARE TOO HIGH </p><p>FOR THE LOW QUALITY OF CARS PRODUCED. </p><p>THE SITUATION TODAY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) FIAT AUTO IS UNDERGOING ITS MOST SEVERE CRISIS EVER, </p><p>THE CUMULATIVE PRODUCT OF ITS FAILURE OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS </p><p>TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER EUROPEAN AUTOMAKERS, LEADING </p><p>TO MOUNTING LOSSES AND THE CRUSHING DEBT UNDER WHICH THE </p><p>ENTERPRISE IS NOW SUFFOCATING (REF A).  IN AN EFFORT TO </p><p>RETRENCH, FIAT AUTO, WHICH HAD ALREADY CLOSED ITS FOREIGN </p><p>PLANTS, HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CLOSE TWO PLANTS AND TO LAY </p><p>OFF ONE-THIRD OF ITS EMPLOYEES FROM ANOTHER.  A REPORTED </p><p>8,000 FIAT AUTO WORKERS WILL BE LAID OFF.  ANOTHER 24,000 </p><p>WORKERS FROM FIAT SUPPLIER FIRMS ALSO COULD LOSE THEIR JOBS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) THE FIAT AUTO CRISIS COMES AT A TIME WHEN ITALY IS </p><p>EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. ITALY\'S GDP </p><p>GROWTH IS LIKELY TO DECLINE TO 0.5 PERCENT IN 2002, A NEAR </p><p>POST-WAR RECORD. ITALY\'S DRAFT BUDGET, AWAITING PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>APPROVAL, ALLOWS VERY LITTLE FLEXIBILITY AND IS GEARED TOWARD </p><p>TIGHTENING FISCAL POLICY TO MEET EU STABILITY PACT TARGETS </p><p>(REF C). THE COST OF FUNDING EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS </p><p>FOR  AFFECTED WORKERS (WHO WOULD RECEIVE UP TO 80 PERCENT OF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1689 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05139  02 OF 04  221054Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------FC2263  221055Z /38 </p><p>P 221008Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6476 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 005139 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC 6800/ITA/TD/OTEA/TISD/HSCHULTZ </p><p>USDOC 4220/IEP/EUR/OWE/SED/DDEFALCO </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/BRUMFIELD </p><p>TREASURY FOR CAROL CARNES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05139  02 OF 04  221054Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/22/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EIND, ELAB, PGOV, IT </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: FIAT IN CRISIS: GOI BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE </p><p> </p><p>THEIR SALARY FOR THREE YEARS, VIRTUALLY ALL OF IT PAID BY THE </p><p>STATE) WOULD PLACE AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON THE GOI. (NOTE: </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE NORMALLY PROVIDED FOR A YEAR AND </p><p>DRAWN FROM A FUND FINANCED BY GOVERNMENT, MANAGEMENT AND </p><p>LABOR. HOWEVER, FIAT AUTO CAN DECLARE THESE DISMISSALS TO BE </p><p>AN &EXCEPTIONAL8 CIRCUMSTANCE AND REQUEST THAT ITS WORKERS </p><p>RECEIVE LONGER-TERM BENEFITS, THEREBY SHIFTING THE DISMISSAL </p><p>COSTS TO THE STATE.  PROVISION OF THESE EXCEPTIONAL BENEFITS </p><p>IS ONE FORM OF PUBLIC SUPPORT UNDER CONSIDERATION. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>LABOR UP-IN-ARMS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) FOR ORGANIZED LABOR, THE FIAT AUTO CRISIS THREATENS </p><p>NOT ONLY THOSE 32,000 (8,000 FIAT PLUS 24,000 SUPPLIER FIRM) </p><p>WORKERS FACING DISMISSAL; ITS EFFECTS COULD REVERBERATE AND </p><p>AFFECT THE 35-40 PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE REPRESENTED BY </p><p>UNIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) EVEN BEFORE THE FIAT AUTO CRISIS BROKE, TWO OF THE </p><p>THREE MAJOR CONFEDERATIONS WARNED THAT THEY WOULD TAKE TO THE </p><p>STREETS IF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>SUPPORT IN SOUTHERN ITALY FAILED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDS </p><p>TO HONOR THE TERMS OF THE LABOR PACT (WHICH, INTER ALIA, </p><p>ESTABLISHES 2003 WAGE RATES) THEY SIGNED WITH EMPLOYERS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05139  02 OF 04  221054Z </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OVER THE SUMMER.  THE LARGEST CONFEDERATION, </p><p>CGIL, DECLARED THAT ITS NATIONWIDE GENERAL STRIKE OCTOBER 18 </p><p>(ORIGINALLY CALLED TO PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>INTRODUCE MORE FLEXIBILITY INTO THE LABOR MARKETS) WAS TO </p><p>PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT\'S OVERALL ECONOMIC POLICY. OCTOBER 18 </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN TURIN (THE HOME OF FIAT), LED BY CGIL </p><p>LEADER GUGLIELMO EPIFANI, TOOK ON A MUCH MORE STRIDENT AND </p><p>COMBATIVE TONE AS A RESULT OF THE FIAT AUTO SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) BUT IT\'S NOT ONLY ABOUT JOBS.  ALL THREE </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS VIEW FIAT AUTO\'S GAMBIT AS THE LATEST EXAMPLE </p><p>OF A MANAGEMENT SECTOR THAT IS INCREASINGLY PREPARED TO </p><p>JETTISON THE CUSTOMARY ITALIAN PRACTICE OF NEGOTIATING WAGES </p><p>AND OTHER WORKPLACE ISSUES BY CONSENSUS.  FIAT AUTO -) BOTH </p><p>ITS TENUOUS POSITION AND ITS PROPOSED REMEDIES )- IS A CASE </p><p>STUDY IN ITALIAN INDUSTRIALISTS, SKEWED PRIORITIES, THEY </p><p>ARGUE.  UNION OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEIR MEMBERS </p><p>BENEFITED FROM THE LONG LIST OF PAST GOVERNMENT BAILOUTS, </p><p>AND, IN THEIR EYES, RIGHTLY SO: ONE OF GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES AS A SOCIAL PARTNER IS TO SUPPORT INDUSTRY </p><p>(AND BY EXTENSION, ITS WORKERS) IN LEAN TIMES.  IN RETURN, </p><p>INDUSTRY SHOULD DEVOTE A PORTION OF ITS PROFITS IN GOOD TIMES </p><p>TO ENSURING ITS LONG-TERM VIABILITY -) AN OBLIGATION FIAT </p><p>AUTO HAS IGNORED, THEY CHARGE.  THE COMPANY INVESTED LITTLE </p><p>IN THE R&D AND DESIGN VITAL TO ENSURING THE COMPANY\'S </p><p>LONG-TERM HEALTH AND MARKET SHARE/POSITION (AND, BY </p><p>EXTENSION, THE JOB SECURITY OF ITS WORK FORCE). </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) THIS ACUTE SENSE OF BETRAYAL OF A LONG-ESTABLISHED </p><p>SOCIAL COMPACT IS FELT MOST STRONGLY IN SICILY, WHERE THE </p><p>1,900-PLUS WORKERS AT FIAT,S TERMINI IMERESE FACTORY HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05139  02 OF 04  221054Z </p><p>BLOCKED HIGHWAYS AND STAGED DEMONSTRATIONS TO PROTEST THEIR </p><p>IMPENDING DISMISSAL.  THE PLANT\'S CLOSURE WOULD BE, IN THE </p><p>EYES OF EVERYONE IN SICILY, FROM AFFECTED WORKERS TO LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, AN ABRUPT REVERSAL OF </p><p>PAST STATE EFFORTS TO REDRESS LONG-STANDING REGIONAL ECONOMIC </p><p>INEQUITIES BY SUBSIDIZING INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE </p><p>SOUTH.  IN A REGION WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT TOPS 20 PERCENT, FIAT </p><p>AUTO\'S DECISION, THEY CHARGE, WILL LEAVE THE WORKERS AND </p><p>AFFECTED COMMUNITIES ONLY ONE REAL ALTERNATIVE: ORGANIZED </p><p>CRIME.  TERMINI IMERESE,S CLOSURE, ARGUE LOCAL OFFICIALS, IS </p><p>AN OPEN DOOR TO THE MAFIA. </p><p> </p><p>FIAT PLAYS THE GAME </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE AGNELLIS TIMED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF FIAT AUTO\'S </p><p>FINANCIAL WOES FOR MAXIMUM POLITICAL ADVANTAGE.  AFTER </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE GOI,S DRAFT BUDGET, AND ESPECIALLY OF ITS </p><p>PROVISIONS FOR ITALY\'S SOUTH, BY MANY IN ITALY\'S POLITICAL </p><p>AND BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT (REF A), THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF FIAT </p><p>AUTO\'S MELTDOWN MADE CLEAR THAT THE COMPANY WOULD SEEK A </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL SHARE OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES IN ANY DEBATE </p><p>REGARDING POSSIBLE BUDGET CHANGES. FIAT AUTO EXECUTIVES WERE </p><p>QUICK TO PLAY UP THE PROSPECT OF MASS LAYOFFS IN FIAT AUTO\'S </p><p>SICILY PLANT.

AGNELLI IS THE ITALIAN POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT, </p><p>OVERTURNED BY THE VICTORY OF BERLUSCONI,S SMOOTH &FORZA </p><p>ITALIA8 POLITICAL MACHINE.

(SBU) ITALIAN BANKS ENGINEERED A MASSIVE BAILOUT OF FIAT </p><p>AUTO IN MID-2002.

PAYING DOWN THE DEBT BURDEN. ITALIAN BANKS HAVE </p><p>REFUSED TO PROVIDE MORE FINANCING TO FIAT AUTO, AND HAVE </p><p>CALLED ON THE GOI NOT TO INTERVENE.  IN THE EVENT THAT FIAT </p><p>AUTO WERE TO FILE -- UNDER DURESS -- FOR BANKRUPTCY, THE </p><p>BANKS COULD FORCE FIAT TO SELL ITS REVENUE GENERATORS (TORO </p><p>ASSICURAZIONI, FERRARI, FIAT AVIO, ETC.)

(SBU) ALTHOUGH THERE WAS PREVIOUSLY LITTLE DOUBT THAT </p><p>FIAT AUTO WOULD EVENTUALLY BE BOUGHT OUT BY GENERAL MOTORS, </p><p>CLEARLY GM IS IN NO HURRY TO ACQUIRE THE FIRM.

IT </p><p>CAN ILL AFFORD TO SUPPORT FORMER FIAT AUTO WORKERS AT </p><p>GOVERNMENT EXPENSE. AND IT CAN ILL AFFORD TO UNDERWRITE </p><p>GREATER FIAT AUTO DEBT.  BUT IT CAN EVEN LESS AFFORD TO </p><p>ALIENATE THOSE WHO DEPEND ON THE COMPANY.  HAVING WON THE </p><p>ACQUIESCENCE OF CISL AND UIL TOWARD GOI PROPOSALS FOR </p><p>MODERATE BEGINNINGS OF MUCH-NEEDED LABOR REFORM, THE GOI </p><p>CANNOT WISH TO ANTAGONIZE THEM NOW.  THE AGNELLIS HAVE PLAYED </p><p>THEIR CARDS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>15.

SOME ARE </p><p>CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO STAND FIRM AND INSIST ON AN </p><p>AGNELLI FAMILY FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION, AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE </p><p>MANAGEMENT CHANGES AND RESTRUCTURING IN THE FIAT EMPIRE. EVEN </p><p>SOME NOTED POLITICAL LEADERS ARE EXPRESSING THEIR FRUSTRATION </p><p>WITH THE AGNELLI FAMILY.  CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR FAZIO TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR SEMBLER ON OCTOBER 17 THAT THE AGNELLIS </p><p>DELIBERATELY NEGLECTED FIAT AUTO, NOT ENCOURAGING PRODUCT </p><p>DESIGN OR IMPROVEMENT, FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES.  THE </p><p>AGNELLI FAMILY WAS TOO COMPLACENT AND SELF-ASSURED THAT </p><p>ITALIANS WOULD ALWAYS BUY FIAT AUTOS, EVEN IF BETTER OPTIONS </p><p>WERE ON THE MARKET. FAZIO EMPHASIZED THAT THE BURDEN OF </p><p>TURNING AROUND FIAT AUTO LIES WITH THE AGNELLI FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) AFTER A MEETING BETWEEN FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI AND </p><p>FIAT AUTO\'S CREDITOR BANKS, AND IN LIGHT OF THE REACTIONS </p><p>FROM GM MANAGEMENT, THE GOI HAS TAKEN A STEP BACK FROM ANY </p><p>IDEA OF DIRECTLY INVESTING IN FIAT AUTO. MINISTER FOR </p><p>PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES MARZANO TOLD ECMIN OCTOBER 17 THAT, </p><p>BEFORE THE GOI PUT MORE MONEY INTO FIAT AUTO, FIAT NEEDED TO </p><p>INSTITUTE A NEW AND VIABLE INDUSTRIAL PLAN. MARZANO SAID THAT </p><p>OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF THE GOI HAS FUNNELED OVER E2 </p><p>BILLION INTO FIAT AUTO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05139  04 OF 04  221055Z </p><p>17. (SBU) THE GOI ALSO NEEDS TO HEED EU COMPETITION POLICIES. </p><p>THE EU COMMISSION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS CONCERNING </p><p>STATE SUBSIDIES, MUST AUTHORIZE ANY PLANNED FINANCIAL </p><p>INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, EU PRESIDENT PRODI HAS MADE IT CLEAR </p><p>THAT HE DOES NOT OPPOSE SUCH INTERVENTION. (NOTE: PRODI, A </p><p>FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY, IS A POTENTIAL LEADER OF THE </p><p>CENTER-LEFT COALITION AND A POSSIBLE NATIONAL-LEVEL </p><p>CANDIDATE.  END NOTE.) EU COMPETITION COMMISSIONER MONTI HAS </p><p>SAID THAT THE EU IS "NEUTRAL" AS LONG AS THERE IS A VIABLE </p><p>INDUSTRIAL PLAN AND THAT COMPETITION RULES ARE RESPECTED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: THE ROAD AHEAD </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) AS DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE AMONG FIAT, THE BANKS, GM, </p><p>LABOR AND THE GOI, SOME SCENARIOS SEEM MORE LIKELY THAN </p><p>OTHERS.  FIAT AUTO WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY DOWNSIZE ITS </p><p>OPERATIONS BUT, UNDER GOI PRESSURE AND WITH A NOD TO LABOR, </p><p>IS UNLIKELY TO CLOSE THE SICILY PLANT.  WORKERS WILL LIKELY </p><p>BE LAID OFF, BUT FEWER THAN FIRST ANNOUNCED.  FIAT AUTO\'S </p><p>CREDITOR BANKS WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR A RESTRUCTURING </p><p>INVOLVING AN AGNELLI FAMILY CONTRIBUTION AND SALE OF OTHER </p><p>FIAT ASSETS.  THE AGNELLIS WILL PUSH FOR FURTHER INJECTIONS </p><p>OF BANK AND GOI FINANCIAL SUPPORT.  FOR NOW, NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>CONTINUE UNDER GOI AUSPICES. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05139 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
