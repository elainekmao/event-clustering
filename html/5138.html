<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000376 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY:  UPDATE ON REFORM MEASURES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 343 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: A GOT team of experts is drafting a letter </p><p>of intent for the 2003 IMF program. IMF resrep hopes to </p><p>receive the draft by this weekend, paving the way for an IMF </p><p>mission as early as next week.  The IMF focus remains the </p><p>2003 budget. While the GOT has formally committed to a 6.5 </p><p>percent of GNP primary surplus, IMF resrep calculates a 3.5 </p><p>percent of GNP shortfall towards that target, after figuring </p><p>in the fiscal saving measures announced last week.  The GOT\'s </p><p>LOI drafting team is debating a second set of fiscal saving </p><p>measures, but meanwhile State Minister Babacan appears to </p><p>have announced a new spending measure - refinancing of Ziraat </p><p>Bank loans to farmers.  On structural reforms, progress is </p><p>mixed:  a good privatization program; very bad Public </p><p>Procurement Law amendments, if adopted; and no forward </p><p>movement on banking sector reform. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Timing and Content of Letter of Intent </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A GOT team, led by Deputy Undersecretary of </p><p>Treasury Aydin Karaoz, is drafting a letter of intent for the </p><p>IMF.  One participant, Central Bank deputy director of </p><p>research Domac, told us the team is too large to come to </p><p>agreement on many issues.  Furthermore, per Domac, there is </p><p>friction between Treasury staff (usually have the lead in </p><p>relations with the IMF), and State Planning experts (who are </p><p>closer to the AK Party).  IMF resrep told us he was expecting </p><p>the draft LOI by mid-week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Arrival of the IMF Mission tentatively slated for </p><p>second half of January is conditioned on the contents of this </p><p>LOI, and some amount of progress on outstanding structural </p><p>reform conditions under the IMF Fourth Review.  Resrep said </p><p>the IMF staff have four "non-negotiable" elements:  GOT and </p><p>Central Bank commitment to a floating exchange rate (as </p><p>"clean" as the current floating regime); a primary budget </p><p>surplus of 6.5 percent of GNP; GOT commitment to the </p><p>independence of the BRSA (so that it can take urgent clean-up </p><p>measures with insolvent and undercapitalized banks); and GOT </p><p>commitment to Central Bank independence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fiscal Policy - Talk of New Savings Measures, </p><p>But Also New Spending Announced </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The linchpin of the IMF program remains the 6.5 </p><p>percent of GNP primary budget surplus.  IMF resrep told us </p><p>that, after the fiscal saving measures announced by PM Gul </p><p>last week, Turkey still faces a 3.5 percent of GNP shortfall </p><p>towards this 2003 target, or roughly $6 billion.  (The IMF </p><p>assesses the real effect of the measures announced last week </p><p>as 1.0 percent of GNP at best, though at face value they </p><p>amounted to 1.7 percent.  Resrep is skeptical that the "tax </p><p>peace" law will result in any additional tax collection, </p><p>noting that some payment of tax arrearages was already </p><p>included in the revenue baseline assumptions.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  IMF Mission Chief Kahkonen has sent a letter to </p><p>Finance Minister Unakitan and State Minister in charge of </p><p>Treasury Babacan warning that the "tax peace" law currently </p><p>in parliament is "an unacceptable initiative," per the IMF </p><p>resrep.  This tax amnesty is too generous (establishes a very </p><p>recent cut-off date for full tax collection of October 2002) </p><p>and is not accompanied by measures to strengthen tax </p><p>administration (in fact the AK government canceled such a </p><p>measure, the "Financial Year Zero" law).  The "tax peace" law </p><p> also contravenes a GOT commitment in prior LOIs not to adopt </p><p>any tax amnesties.  The law is still in parliamentary </p><p>committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Finance Ministry budget deputy director general </p><p>Ahmet Kesik told us January 15 that the GOT team working on </p><p>the LOI is considering a second set of fiscal saving </p><p>measures.  One large expenditure cut under consideration </p><p>would expand the portion of civil servant wages subject to </p><p>social security withholding.  Such a move would have the </p><p>effect of reducing civil servants net wages, and thus faces </p><p>resistance. </p><p>7.  (U)  On the other hand, it appears that State Minister </p><p>Babacan announced a new spending measure on January 14. In an </p><p>interview with Bloomberg, Babacan announced that state-owned </p><p>Ziraat Bank would reschedule farmers\' loans.  Comment:  If </p><p>the GOT has taken this decision, then it will, under the </p><p>banking law amendments of 2001, have to budget the cost of </p><p>writing down Ziraat loans - this will add to the 3.5 percent </p><p>of GNP fiscal shortfall for 2003.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Structural Reforms - Mixed Picture </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) While there has been some forward movement on </p><p>structural reforms (privatization), the GOT is attempting to </p><p>backslide in one area (Public Procurement Law) and is not </p><p>moving forward in another (banking). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Privatization:  The ambitious program announced </p><p>January 13 was well received in the local press.  The </p><p>adoption of a detailed privatization plan for TEKEL should </p><p>meet a prior action under the IMF Fourth Review (reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  Public Procurement Law:  The AK Party-proposed </p><p>amendments to the Public Procurement Law would have the </p><p>effect of watering down a key anti-corruption achievement of </p><p>the 2002 reform program.  IMF resrep told us the 40 different </p><p>amendments under consideration in parliament would </p><p>collectively reduce the scope of the new law to less than one </p><p>third of GOT procurement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Others are lobbying against the Public Procurement </p><p>amendments. The World Bank sent a letter to State Minister </p><p>Babacan and Finance Minister Unakitan.  According to WB </p><p>economist Jim Parks, WB Vice President Linn has a talking </p><p>point for his upcoming meeting with PM Gul that adoption of </p><p>these amendments would result in suspension of all World Bank </p><p>public sector lending to Turkey. (There are two tranches, </p><p>together worth $900 million, of WB lending scheduled for </p><p>2003).  The EU Commission has written a letter to Treasury </p><p>U/S Oztrak protesting the proposed changes, and EU embassies </p><p>are attempting to organize a joint demarche against them as </p><p>well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Despite public and private pressures not to </p><p>proceed with the amendments, there are indications that AK </p><p>intends to push them through.  Minister for Public Works Zeki </p><p>Ergezen told the press January 15 that "the Public </p><p>Procurement Law amendments were temporarily halted (in </p><p>committee) to make technical corrections, not because of </p><p>criticism."  Erdal Saglam, a Hurriyet columnist and Ankara </p><p>insider, explained to us his view of the pressure within AKP </p><p>to make these changes:  "The AK leadership wants to help a </p><p>group of businessmen in the same way that former President </p><p>Ozal enriched a whole class of businessmen - through </p><p>government contracts." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Banking Reform:  A key condition under the IMF </p><p>Fourth Review is resolution of the ownership of two large </p><p>banks - Pamuk and Yapi Kredi.  Pamukbank was declared </p><p>insolvent in June, and taken over by the BRSA; its sister </p><p>bank Yapi Kredi is seriously undercapitalized but not yet </p><p>insolvent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) The Supreme Administrative Court (Danistay) </p><p>decision to return Pamukbank to its owners was formally given </p><p>to the BRSA on January 19, giving BRSA 30 days to return the </p><p>bank to its owner Cukurova Holding.  We understand from BRSA </p><p>sources (Deputy Chairman Canakci) that Cukurova Holding is </p><p>holding out for a "sweet deal" in its talks with BRSA; it </p><p>wants return of the bank with the $2.5 billion in GOT </p><p>securities put in by the BRSA.   Comment:  The BRSA must by </p><p>court order return Pamuk, but it cannot do so with the public </p><p>funds invested.  Thus the BRSA will likely have to take over </p><p>Pamuk once again - but will be reluctant to do so a second </p><p>time without strong political support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) To date, AK support for BRSA has been lacking. </p><p>When challenged about BRSA actions on Pamuk and Yapi Kredi by </p><p>an AK MP in parliament recently, Deputy PM Sener read out a </p><p>statement prepared by the BRSA defending their actions.  But </p><p>when this statement was reported in the press January 12, </p><p>Sener told the press he was just reading a prepared </p><p>statement, he refused to endorse the BRSA. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
