<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003878 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO ALSO FOR FAS - CHAUDRY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN OFFERS FOOD SAFETY HELP ON IRAQ IMPORTS </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  In mid-June, Jordanian and Iraqi businesspeople </p><p>purchased on the high seas a shipment of 4,652 tons of </p><p>Brazilian frozen chicken for import to Iraq through </p><p>Jordan.  The same shipment had previously been rejected by </p><p>Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen for health and safety reasons </p><p>due to a problem with the freezing system in the vessel. </p><p>When the ship arrived in the port of Aqaba, the Jordanian </p><p>Health and Agriculture Ministers rejected the shipment as </p><p>unfit for human consumption under GOJ standards. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Aqaba Special Economic Zone Chief Commissioner </p><p>Beltaji approached the Ambassador to say that Jordan had </p><p>been uncomfortable in taking this action since food </p><p>health and safety inspections are normally the </p><p>responsibility of the health authorities of the final </p><p>importing country.  However, the GOJ -- knowing that such </p><p>inspections are not taking place in Iraq -- decided that </p><p>it had a moral responsibility to the Iraqi people not to </p><p>allow unsafe food to pass through its territory. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Beltaji and Health Minister Walid al-Maani told </p><p>the Ambassador that the Jordanian authorities were ready </p><p>upon request of authorities in Iraq to conduct regular </p><p>health and safety inspections of food transiting Jordan </p><p>to Iraq.  This would be temporary until Iraqi officials </p><p>were able to resume their own inspections at the border. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Action request:  Please advise. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
