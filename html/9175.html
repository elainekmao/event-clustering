<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001162 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EPET, ENRG, PGOV, ASEC, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: STRIKE CONTINUES TO HOLD FOR FOURTH DAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1157 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 1147 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 1135 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 1107 </p><p>     E. ABUJA 1091 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons:  1.5 (B </p><p>& D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY: July 3 was relatively quiet in Abuja. </p><p>Vehicular traffic was light, gas lines were growing and </p><p>most offices and businesses had skeletal staffing. </p><p>Indicating that the political opposition may be looking for </p><p>ways to exploit the strike, the Embassy experienced a </p><p>peaceful demonstration this morning of about 40-50 people </p><p>protesting the April elections and discouraging the </p><p>upcoming POTUS visit.  Talks between the GON and the NLC </p><p>ended without a follow-up meeting scheduled.  Both sides </p><p>appear to be sticking to their positions, for now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Demonstrations occurred in Abuja on Wednesday in </p><p>four separate locations; Port Harcourt, Zaria and Kano </p><p>witnessed their first public demonstrations yesterday as </p><p>well.  In Port Harcourt, a confrontation between police and </p><p>demonstrators produced unconfirmed reports of three </p><p>students killed when the police used live rounds to </p><p>disperse the rally.  Negotiations between the GON and NLC </p><p>reportedly broke off early this morning with no follow-on </p><p>meeting scheduled.  NUPENG ordered its employees to honor </p><p>the strike and this action could affect crude oil exports. </p><p>Air traffic controllers are reportedly joining the strike, </p><p>which could limit domestic air travel.  With a memorial </p><p>service planned for slain ANPP figure Marshall Harry </p><p>scheduled for Friday, Port Harcourt could be a potential </p><p>flashpoint.  What happens after Juma\'at prayers in Abuja </p><p>and other northern cities will also bear close watching. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>ATMOSPHERICS </p><p>------------ </p><p>3. (U) Wednesday\'s demonstrations in Abuja were more </p><p>widespread than in previous days.  Up to 100 people may </p><p>have been injured at Abuja\'s Wuse Market when police </p><p>attempted to disperse a crowd by firing shots and using </p><p>teargas.  Many of the injuries were caused by the panicked </p><p>flight of hundreds from the market.  Small gangs were </p><p>reported to be smashing car windows in isolated areas of </p><p>Abuja.  In Port Harcourt, demonstrators were confronted by </p><p>security officers who used teargas to disperse the crowd. </p><p>According to witnesses, some demonstrators responded by </p><p>throwing rocks at the police, who fired their weapons at </p><p>the crowd.  Reports of three deaths have not been </p><p>confirmed. </p><p>4.  (U) In the northern town of Zaria, about 1000 </p><p>demonstrators took to the streets on Wednesday.  Police </p><p>intervened to halt the protest by firing teargas into the </p><p>crowd.  Kano experienced a peaceful demonstration, with at </p><p>least 3,000 protestors.  Governor Shekarau commiserated </p><p>with the strikers and ordered security to allow the </p><p>demonstration to continue as long as it remained peaceful. </p><p>At the Emir\'s Palace, the Emir Ado Bayero, a supporter of </p><p>Obasanjo, also told the crowd the price hikes had surprised </p><p>him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The strike appears to be holding, if not actually </p><p>picking up steam in many parts of the country.  Workers </p><p>generally are honoring the strike.  For instance, in Lagos </p><p>activity was minimal again.  NLC supporters continue to </p><p>impede traffic to and from Lagos\' Murtala Mohammed </p><p>International Airport.  In the Northeast, workers in Yola </p><p>and Maiduguri remained strike compliant.  Most banks, gas </p><p>stations and businesses remained closed.  Government </p><p>offices were significantly understaffed despite reported </p><p>talk of punitive government action against striking civil </p><p>servants.  In the South-South, Calabar is reportedly calm, </p><p>but government workers are staying away from the offices. </p><p>There was a demonstration in Aba, Abia State with some </p><p>violence.  Fuel, already limited before the strike, is </p><p>generally unavailable throughout the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS: ON OR OFF? </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) According to government sources, the current </p><p>session of negotiations between the GON and NLC ended this </p><p>morning with no follow-on meeting scheduled (although a </p><p>meeting could be arranged later today).  Senior NLC </p><p>officials and other Embassy labor sources reported the </p><p>negotiations were "a failure."  While the GON is publicly </p><p>touting progress towards a compromise, NLC sources </p><p>privately say the two sides have made little progress. </p><p>While many claim that a deal is in the offing, a NLC </p><p>official told Econoff that Obasanjo was "playing a waiting </p><p>game, which is getting more dangerous for the country\'s </p><p>political stability." </p><p>7.  (U) NUPENG has reportedly ordered its employees to </p><p>withdraw from the oil terminals, which could reduce crude </p><p>oil exports.  They said the decision was based on </p><p>PENGASSEN\'s Saturday deadline to withdraw its workers from </p><p>the oil fields.  (COMMENT: Other reliable sources have </p><p>indicated that NUPENG and PENGASSEN may not join the </p><p>strike.  We are unable to say with certainty which path </p><p>they will take.  END COMMENT.)  Representatives for the air </p><p>traffic controllers say they are joining the strike unless </p><p>a settlement is reached soon.  Domestic air travel has been </p><p>restricted throughout the week, with one carrier grounded </p><p>for the entire week and others managing around 50 percent </p><p>of their scheduled flights.  As of now, no major </p><p>international carrier has cancelled flights into or out of </p><p>Nigeria, but at least one is considering the prospect of </p><p>discontinuing operations after Friday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) GON officials remain optimistic about the prospect </p><p>of a settlement today or tomorrow.  A GON official told </p><p>EMBOFF that NLC Executive Council members have been </p><p>summoned to Abuja to review a potential agreement and that </p><p>the meeting could take place as early as tonight.  The </p><p>Inspector General of Police issued a public statement </p><p>denying any fatalities due to police crowd control </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>A CONFLUENCE OF EVENTS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Exacerbating a tense atmosphere in Port Harcourt is </p><p>the scheduled July 4 memorial service and burial for slain </p><p>ANPP chieftain Marshall Harry.  Many high-level ANPP </p><p>members plan to attend, including ANPP presidential </p><p>candidate Muhammadu Buhari. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Despite a respite in confrontations today, the </p><p>strike has shown no sign of weakening and its sympathizers </p><p>may be getting more strident in some areas.  The </p><p>possibility of NUPENG and PENGASSEN joining the strike and </p><p>the resultant effect on crude oil production and exports </p><p>could be a major factor in whether the strike is settled </p><p>sooner or later, with Labor possibly gaining a huge </p><p>advantage it does not appear to have now. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
