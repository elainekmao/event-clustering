<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000306 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR SAYS COMMUNAL </p><p>VIOLENCE SHOULD NOT DETER FOREIGN INVESTORS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. The Ambassador and EmbOffs met January 24 </p><p>with Chief Economic Advisor Magnus Kpakol who claimed that </p><p>Nigeria\'s best hopes for future reform lay with the </p><p>reelection of President Obasanjo.  Kpakol argued that recent </p><p>communal conflicts throughout the country should not deter </p><p>foreign investors from doing business in Nigeria.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On January 24, Ambassador Jeter met Chief Economic </p><p>Advisor to the President Magnus Kpakol to discuss the </p><p>structure of the new bilateral Economic Committee (septel). </p><p>Kpakol also discussed prospects for the Presidential election </p><p>and the impact of communal conflicts on foreign investment in </p><p>Nigeria.  PolEcon Counselor and EconOff also attended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador told Kpakol that recent outbreaks of </p><p>communal violence have created the perception of instability, </p><p>sending the signal overseas that Nigeria might be in a stage </p><p>of "unraveling."  As the 2003 elections  near, people fear </p><p>the outbreaks will occur more frequently and could taint the </p><p>election process.  The Ambassador added that it was critical </p><p>for Nigerians to see that economic growth, although </p><p>important, was not the only dividend from democracy.  The </p><p>social and political benefits arising from freedoms of </p><p>speech, press and association should be recognized as </p><p>\'democracy dividends\', as well, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Kpakol added that democracy dividends should also be </p><p>divided between internal and external dividends.  Internal </p><p>dividends would include economic reforms, political freedoms, </p><p>improved access to services, and increased incomes while </p><p>external dividends include stronger foreign direct </p><p>investment, debt relief and other assistance.  Kpakol </p><p>believed economic reforms were advancing as much as possible </p><p>given the political constraints of Nigeria\'s young democracy, </p><p>pointing to the privatization of NITEL, fuel price </p><p>deregulation and exchange rate liberalization.  However, the </p><p>federal government could not try to do too much, too fast, he </p><p>said. If so the economic bite would be harsh and would sour </p><p>the public on the expected fruits of democracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Kpakol felt that if Nigeria were able to survive </p><p>through this difficult time (the elections) with the current </p><p>Administration, then in his next term, President Obasanjo </p><p>would be less restrained by electoral considerations and able </p><p>to pursue significant economic reforms.  He worried that </p><p>another Administration next term would "do things </p><p>differently" and be less likely to walk the path of reform. </p><p>Kpakol could not identify any other Presidential candidates, </p><p>apart from Obasanjo, with reformist-minded ambitions. </p><p>Moreover, he argued that while the GON was doing its part to </p><p>realize the internal democracy dividends, the donor community </p><p>was languid in helping Nigeria realize the external </p><p>dividends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Kpakol argued that the perception that Nigeria was </p><p>unraveling was unjustified and inaccurate.  He pointed out </p><p>that recent communal conflicts were not acts of random </p><p>violence, but stemmed from historical rivalries between </p><p>identifiable groups.  Kpakol argued that foreign investors </p><p>were not targeted and, therefore, should not be deterred from </p><p>doing business in Nigeria.  Kpakol claimed that people </p><p>intimately familiar with Nigeria\'s socio-political </p><p>environment (implying the Ambassador and Embassy officers) </p><p>and who understand the difference between random violence and </p><p>communal violence, should spread the word that Nigeria was </p><p>not coming apart.  (Comment: On this point, Kpakol\'s argument </p><p>became casuistry.  Too eager to prove his point, he </p><p>uncharacteristically abandoned logic by implying that random </p><p>violence, unless talking about pure anomie, was more a threat </p><p>to internal stability than an increasing frequency of </p><p>communal violence that affects thousands of people with each </p><p>occurrence.  End comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador agreed that the communal violence was </p><p>not random or targeted at foreigners.  However, he stressed </p><p>that the violence and the government\'s sometimes brusque </p><p>manner to suppress it were raising concerns in Washington and </p><p>other Western capitals.  Moreover, some influential U.S. </p><p>lawmakers were justifiably concerned about the military\'s </p><p>role in the Tiv-Junkun conflict in Benue.  Should another </p><p>incident occur, we would have to take a very close look at </p><p>our bilateral military-to-military relationship.  Kpakol </p><p>understood this perspective and pointed out that the federal </p><p>government would thoroughly investigate the Benue tragedy. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
