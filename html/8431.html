(C) Summary: In an attempt to finally put to rest the </p><p>knotty problem of EU fines for overproducing milk, the </p><p>Berlusconi government has found itself caught between an </p><p>exasperated EU and intransigent Italian milk producers, </p><p>supported by the Northern League (LN).  The GOI has used </p><p>tough tactics in Brussels and in the Italian Parliament in </p><p>hopes of forcing through measures to permit dairy farmers to </p><p>pay back, over 30 years without interest, E 924 million in EU </p><p>fines for excess milk production.  In the EU Council of </p><p>Ministers, Italy is blocking agreement on the EU Tax Package </p><p>until the 14 other member states agree to the deal.  In the </p><p>Italian Chamber of Deputies, on May 21, the GOI forced all </p><p>coalition deputies to approve a decree law, requiring the </p><p>farmers to pay the fines over the next 30 years.  The vote </p><p>had to be made a vote of confidence to ensure approval.  The </p><p>Northern League abstained -- a major concession as most LN </p><p>deputies strongly opposed the measure.  The Senate is </p><p>approved on May 29.  However, for the measure to be </p><p>effective, the GOI will have to persuade the EU to go along </p><p>with it.  Some observers believe the matter will eventually </p><p>go to the European Court of Justice.  The GOI, in trying to </p><p>resolve an increasingly troublesome dispute, has damaged </p><p>itself in the EU on the eve of its presidency and has won </p><p>itself no friends at home.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Watching Italy stubbornly stall action within </p><p>Ecofin on the EU Tax Package ) holding it hostage to </p><p>concessions allowing Italian dairy farmers to pay EU fines </p><p>for excessive milk production over 30 years, many observers </p><p>wonder why.   Why is Italy, a country known for compromise </p><p>and flexibility, making such a fuss about milk quotas? </p><p> </p><p>How Craxi,s Government Created the Problem </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In 1984, the center-left government of Prime </p><p>Minister Bettino Craxi accepted milk production limits </p><p>proposed by the EU Commission that were far below the level </p><p>of domestic milk production at that time.  Opinions differ as </p><p>to whether this was due to Italian incompetence (the Ministry </p><p>of Agriculture not knowing how to get an accurate statistical </p><p>read-out of the true production picture), or simple </p><p>disinterest (the GOI agreeing to an EU proposed quota) or in </p><p>exchange for some other concession from Brussels.  Whatever </p><p>the case, the upshot was that Italian milk producers found </p><p>themselves limited to production levels well below previous </p><p>levels and well below domestic demand. Moreover, according to </p><p>an independent producers association, a significant amount of </p><p>Italy\'s quota was assigned to farms that did not produce </p><p>milk, but had falsely applied for quotas and subsidies.  This </p><p>left legitimate milk producers with even lower quotas. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Once the quotas were made public, the GOI found </p><p>itself faced with serious national protests by dairies, milk </p><p>producers and the animal breeder association (AIA). </p><p>Producers blocked motorways and Milan\'s Linate Airport, </p><p>poured milk onto roads and distributed free milk in town </p><p>squares.   The GOI\'s response was to reassure producers that </p><p>they didn\'t need to worry about the quotas, and that </p><p>everything would somehow be worked out. Moreover, they told </p><p>producers that they would never have to pay the EU fines and </p><p>that a way would be found in Brussels to solve the problem. </p><p>The milk producers agreed to suspend their demonstrations, </p><p>but threatened to resume them if ever forced to pay the </p><p>fines. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Over the nearly 20 years since, dairy farmers have </p><p>continued to resist the quotas.  Unpaid fines for </p><p>overproduction mounted -- in some cases to well over the </p><p>annual income of the producer.  Italian governments initiated </p><p>the practice of paying these fines to Brussels on behalf of </p><p> </p><p>offending milk producers.  Successive center-left governments </p><p>continued to assure producers that they would never have to </p><p>pay the fines.  Any apparent change in policy triggered </p><p>renewed protests ) blocked motorways and gallons of milk </p><p>poured out publicly.  Successive governments ) most recently </p><p>that of Amato in 2000 ) provided renewed assurances. </p><p>Regional disputes within Italy regarding quotas have also </p><p>grown.  The Lombardy region has taken the GOI to court a </p><p>number of times arguing that their producers have received </p><p>too little of the total quota. </p><p> </p><p>Between a Rock and a Hard Place </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The government of Prime Minister Berlusconi came to </p><p>office in 2001, and found the milk quota issue reaching a </p><p>crisis point.  The GOI decision to pay the fines on behalf of </p><p>its Italian producers was not viable.  The EU Commission had </p><p>confirmed in a ruling that Italian farmers were liable for </p><p>the overproduction fines, and that payment by the GOI </p><p>consitituted an illegal state aid.  The accumulated penalties </p><p>had mounted to E 924 million, far beyond, producers </p><p>contended, their ability to reimburse the government. </p><p>Moreover, these producers remained bitter over the 1984 </p><p>imposition of quotas -- seen as an act of betrayal by the </p><p>government.  They refused to be victimized a second time. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Faced with diametrically opposed forces on both </p><p>sides, the GOI determined to craft a compromise solution -- </p><p>which it calculated that both sides would resist, but might </p><p>eventually accept: The fines would be paid back by the </p><p>farmers (as Brussels required), but over a period of 30 years </p><p>and without interest (to prevent massive bankruptcies among </p><p>milk producers). </p><p> </p><p>Getting to Yes in Parliament </p><p>8. (C) In late March 2003, the GOI introduced a decree law to </p><p>this effect in Parliament, despite having been rebuffed by EU </p><p>member state finance ministers on March 7 in ECOFIN (ref A), </p><p>at a special March 19 ECOFIN session and by heads of state </p><p>and government at the March 20 EU summit (ref B).  Reports </p><p>received by USEU agree that the GOI\'s strategy of tying </p><p>approval of the unrelated EU Tax Package in the ECOFIN </p><p>Council to a rollback of the Commission ruling on milk </p><p>production fines succeeded only in alienating the other 14 </p><p>governments, who regarded the GOI maneuver as "blackmail." </p><p>All had anticipated easy approval of the Tax Package March 7, </p><p>following political agreement in the Council (including </p><p>Italy) on the troublesome savings taxation measure January 21 </p><p>after over a year of hard bargaining (Ref C).  The GOI had </p><p>not helped its case by failing to signal its intention at the </p><p>February 18 ECOFIN little more than two weeks earlier (Ref </p><p>B). </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) It was immediately clear that the Berlusconi </p><p>government\'s proposed decree law faced tough opposition even </p><p>within the governing coalition.  Northern League (LN) party </p><p>leader Umberto Bossi (whose northern Italian base includes </p><p>most of Italy\'s dairy production) had made fair treatment of </p><p>milk producers a key platform in his 2001 campaign.   Other </p><p>LN leaders had pledged to protect producers from having to </p><p>pay "unfair" fines.  The GOI faced the real prospect of </p><p>seeing the legislation defeated. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The decision was therefore made to make the vote on </p><p>milk quotas a vote of confidence.  This was not an </p><p>unprecedented step.  In fact, since 2001, the Berlusconi </p><p>government had called six votes of confidence -- two in the </p><p>Senate and four in the Chamber of Deputies.   The vote was </p><p>called on May 21, and passed easily.  However, Northern </p><p>League (LN) deputies abstained, and many made clear their </p><p>resentment during the Chamber\'s debate.   The LN Group </p><p>Leader, Alessandro Ce, declared:  "Today we renew our </p><p>confidence in the Government, but Berlusconi should no longer </p><p>have any illusions."  He went on to argue that legislation </p><p>like the milk quota decree law damaged the Italian people and </p><p>the Italian national interest. </p><p> </p><p>The Decree Law </p><p> </p><p>11.(U) The decree law approved in the Chamber provides for </p><p>monthly installment payments by milk producers of fines for </p><p>overproduction during the period 1995/96 to 2001/2. The </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture will establish special incentives for </p><p>conversion from milk production to other livestock </p><p>production. </p><p> </p><p>Next Steps </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) The decree now must be approved by the Senate, </p><p>where it is expected to pass easily.  EU member state </p><p>representatives in Brussels reached no agreement at its May </p><p>28 COREPER, and discussions are scheduled to continue at the </p><p>COREPER meeting on June 2.  Depending on the results of that </p><p>meeting, finance ministers may consider it again during the </p><p>June 3 ECOFIN council in Luxembourg.  Unanimous approval </p><p>would be necessary for the Council to overrule the Commission </p><p>decision to require milk producers to repay the GOI </p><p>immediately for fines paid on their behalf. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The Italian Government has struggled mightily to </p><p>solve a longstanding, deeply entrenched problem.  However, no </p><p>one is applauding.  The milk producers are decrying </p><p>unfairness and betrayal.  Northern League politicians are </p><p>complaining that core LN interests are ignored, while LN </p><p>support is taken for granted.  In Italy, the milk quota </p><p>problem is one with no easy solution, which has created </p><p>considerable discomfort within the majority coalition.  As </p><p>evidenced by the confidence vote, however, even on an issue </p><p>this close to its core interests, the Northern League (as do </p><p>other coalition partners) sees its interests better protected </p><p>by being within the government than by leaving it.  While </p><p>there will be no government collapse, this issue may resonate </p><p>within Italy for some time to come.  Within the EU, Italy has </p><p>damaged its standing on the eve of its EU presidency. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) This message has been coordinated with USEU Brussels. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02429 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
