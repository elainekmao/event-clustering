<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOE JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WSSD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Government-owned print and broadcast media in </p><p>      Zimbabwe gave prominent coverage to the heckling of </p><p>      Secretary of State Powell at the WSSD on September 4. </p><p>      The story featured prominently on television and radio </p><p>      news programs and was page 1, above-the-fold in the </p><p>      government-owned Herald and Chronicle newspapers.  All </p><p>      reporting in government media sought to portray the </p><p>      heckling of Powell as an additional sign of President </p><p>      Mugabe\'s popularity and strength, and the "isolation" </p><p>      of the United States and the UK.  Excerpts follow. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Attempt to blame Zim for Food </p><p>      crisis backfires: Colin Powell Booed" the government- </p><p>      controlled daily "The Herald" (09/05) carried the </p><p>      following page-1 story by political editor Munyaradzi </p><p>      Huni: </p><p> </p><p>     "U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Colin Powell\'s bid to </p><p>     blame Zimbabwe for the prevailing food crisis </p><p>     yesterday backfired when he was booed and jeered </p><p>     by delegates to the Earth Summit.  All hell broke </p><p>     loose when Mr. Powell charged that Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>     alleged lack of respect for human rights and </p><p>     democracy was causing the food crisis in the </p><p>     country and pushing `millions of people to the </p><p>     brink of starvation.\'  Mr. Powell. . .was scolded </p><p>     by delegates who saw the attack on Zimbabwe as an </p><p>     attempt to exonerate British Prime Minister Tony </p><p>     Blair from the humiliating dressing down by </p><p>     President Mugabe over Britain\'s interference in </p><p>     Zimbabwe on Monday. . . </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Zimbabwean radio and television (all government- </p><p>      owned) news reports on September 4 and 5 portrayed the </p><p>      heckling of the Secretary of State as another </p><p>      expression of global popular support for President </p><p>      Mugabe.  William Nhara, a political analyst interviewed </p><p>      on the September 4 prime-time television news program </p><p>      said that President Mugabe\'s speech at the WSSD was </p><p>      comparable to Martin Luther King\'s "I have a Dream </p><p>      Speech" in terms of liberating Africans from </p><p>      colonialism.  Nhara went on to say that, in the wake of </p><p>      Mugabe\'s speech, the U.S. and UK were isolated in their </p><p>      criticism of Mugabe.  This comment was followed by a </p><p>      three-minute report on the Secretary of State\'s speech </p><p>      in which the reporter sought to make the case that the </p><p>      Secretary was heckled by "the growing international </p><p>      coalition" of President Mugabe\'s supporters. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   The independent "Daily News" and Financial </p><p>      Gazette" carried a factual Reuters accounts of Powell\'s </p><p>      speech and the interruptions to it.  The wire service </p><p>      article attributed the heckling to "environmentalists." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
