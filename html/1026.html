<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ATHENS 007913 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, GR </p><p>SUBJECT:  GREECE:  1999 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 204472 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE TEXT BELOW IS OUR DRAFT CONTRIBUTION TO THE GREEK SECTION </p><p>IN THE FORTHCOMING "PATTERNS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM:  1999," AS </p><p>REQUIRED BY REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM IN GREECE CONTINUED </p><p>TO PROVE ILLUSIVE IN 1999 AS THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS AGAINST </p><p>U.S., OTHER FOREIGN, AND GREEK INTERESTS PROLIFERATED </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  INTERNATIONAL EVENTS RE- </p><p>IGNITED A LATENT ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING IN GREECE, WHICH </p><p>TERRORISTS AND ANARCHISTS EXPLOITED.  THE AUTHORITIES FAILED TO </p><p>ARREST A SINGLE MEMBER OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN 1999 AND </p><p>CONVICTED ONLY TWO SUSPECTS FOR ATTACKS MOUNTED IN PREVIOUS </p><p>YEARS.  GREEK AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO PROMISE REFORMS IN </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM INITIATIVES AND METHODS, BUT RESULTS ARE </p><p>INCONCLUSIVE. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING HIS DEPORTATION FROM SYRIA IN OCTOBER 1998 UNTIL HIS </p><p>CAPTURE IN NAIROBI IN FEBRUARY 1999, PKK LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN </p><p>TRANSITED GREECE THREE TIMES.  EACH TIME, GREEK OFFICIALS QUIETLY </p><p>EXPELLED HIM.  SUBSEQUENTLY, SEVERAL CABINET AND OTHER SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAVING PROVIDED OCALAN </p><p>TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN IN THE GREEK AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE IN KENYA </p><p>AND WERE COMPELLED TO RESIGN.  IN MARCH, GREECE\'S MOST DEADLY </p><p>TERRORIST GROUP, "REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION 17 NOVEMBER," ISSUED </p><p>A MANIFESTO PLACING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OCALAN\'S ARREST ON THE </p><p>GREEK AND U.S. GOVERNMENTS.  IT ALSO BLAMED THE GREEK GOVERNMENT </p><p>MORE GENERALLY FOR FAILING TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY\'S INTERESTS </p><p>VIS-A-VIS TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>BETWEEN MARCH AND MAY, INDIGENOUS TERRORIST AND ANARCHIST GROUPS </p><p>MOUNTED NUMEROUS ATTACKS AGAINST WESTERN INTERESTS IN GREECE IN </p><p>SEEKING TO EXPLOIT PUBLIC UNHAPPINESS OVER THE OCALAN ARREST AND </p><p>NATO OPERATIONS AGAINST SERBIA DURING THE KOSOVO CRISIS. </p><p>NUMEROUS ANTI-U.S. AND ANTI-NATO DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTED THE AIR </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST SERBIA.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ISSUED A PUBLIC </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT, VALID FOR EIGHT WEEKS, INFORMING POTENTIAL U.S. </p><p>TRAVELERS TO GREECE ABOUT THE SECURITY CLIMATE. </p><p> </p><p>"17 NOVEMBER" IS SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OUT ROCKET ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>SIX TARGETS IN APRIL AND MAY ALTHOUGH IT NEVER CLAIMED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE OPERATIONS:  THE RESIDENCES OF THE </p><p>GERMAN AND DUTCH AMBASSADORS, BRANCH OFFICES OF THE RULING PASOK </p><p>PARTY, A CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, A BRITISH BANK, AND A FRENCH BANK. </p><p>OTHER TERRORIST AND ANARCHIST GROUPS TARGETED NUMEROUS U.S., </p><p>EUROPEAN, AND GREEK BANKS AND BUSINESSES, A POLICE STATION, THE </p><p>GREEK-ISRAELI FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION, THE AUSTRIAN EMBASSY\'S </p><p>COMMERCIAL OFFICE, AND A UN-AFFILIATED BUILDING.  THE </p><p>PERPETRATORS PLANTED EXPLOSIVE OR INCENDIARY DEVICES (SOME WERE </p><p>DEFUSED) OR STAGED DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS FROM MOTORCYCLES.  AMONG </p><p>THE GROUPS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS WERE "RED </p><p>LINE," "REVOLUTIONARY NUCLEI," "BLACK STAR," "ENRAGED </p><p>ANARCHISTS," AND "FILIKI ETAIREIA."  MOST ATTACKS WERE TIMED TO </p><p>OCCUR WHEN INJURIES WERE NOT LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE. </p><p>"REVOLUTIONARY NUCLEI" WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOMBING THE </p><p>INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL IN APRIL, WHICH KILLED ONE GREEK CITIZEN </p><p>AND INJURED ANOTHER.  NO ARRESTS WERE MADE IN ANY OF THESE </p><p>INCIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>A YOUNG WOMAN ATTEMPTED TO FIREBOMB THE U.S. CONSULATE IN </p><p>THESSALONIKI IN EARLY APRIL, BUT A GUARD EMPLOYED BY THE FACILITY </p><p>FRUSTRATED THE ATTACK AND ALERTED THE POLICE.  AFTER A FEW DAYS\' </p><p>DETENTION, AUTHORITIES RELEASED THE WOMAN INTO THE CUSTODY OF HER </p><p>PARENTS.  LATER THAT MONTH, A BOMB WAS ALSO PLACED AT THE OFFICES </p><p>OF THE FULBRIGHT FOUNDATION IN THESSALONIKI, BUT IT WAS DEFUSED </p><p>AND DESTROYED BEFORE IT COULD EXPLODE. </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION, NUMEROUS UNIDENTIFIED CALLERS TO THE U.S. EMBASSY </p><p>ANNOUNCED BOMB ATTACKS AND OTHER LIFE-THREATENING ACTS AGAINST </p><p>THE CHANCERY, U.S. AND GREEK EMPLOYEES, THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY </p><p>SCHOOL, THE CONSULATE IN THESSALONIKI, AND U.S.-AFFILIATED HOTELS </p><p>IN ATHENS.  ALL OF THESE CALLS TURNED OUT TO BE HOAXES. </p><p> </p><p>FOCUSING ON THE "17 NOVEMBER" THREAT, U.S. COUNTERTERRORIST </p><p>COORDINATOR SHEEHAN CAME TO GREECE IN JULY FOR CONSULTATION WITH </p><p>MINISTER OF PUBLIC ORDER CHRYSOCHOIDIS TO ENHANCE </p><p>COUNTERTERRORIST COOPERATION.  CHRYSOCHOIDIS, WHO VISITED </p><p>WASHINGTON IN OCTOBER FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS, PUBLICLY OUTLINED </p><p>HIS PLANS TO MODERNIZE THE HELLENIC POLICE WITH THE AIM OF </p><p>COMBATTING "17 NOVEMBER."  SINCE ITS FIRST KNOWN CRIMINAL ACT IN </p><p>1975, THE MURDER OF A U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIAL, NO MEMBER OF "17 </p><p>NOVEMBER" HAS BEEN ARRESTED.  ALTOGETHER, "17 NOVEMBER" HAS </p><p>MURDERED FOUR U.S. DIPLOMATS AND ONE GREEK EMBASSY EMPLOYEE AND </p><p>HAS WOUNDED NUMEROUS AMERICAN OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>THE HELLENIC POLICE DISCOVERED BLOOD PRESUMABLY BELONGING TO THE </p><p>PERPETRATOR OF THE ATTACK IN MAY ON THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>RESIDENCE.  GREEK PRESS REPORTS IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER CLAIMED </p><p>THAT AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY BOTH THE TYPE AND DNA </p><p>OF THE BLOOD SAMPLE AND WERE NARROWING THE SEARCH FOR THE </p><p>PERPETRATOR. </p><p> </p><p>NIKOS MAZIOTIS WAS CONVICTED OF A BOMBING ATTACK AGAINST THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT MINISTRY IN 1997 AND SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS.  GIORGOS </p><p>BALAFAS, WHO HAS SERVED TIME FOR MORE SERIOUS TERRORIST-RELATED </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN THE PAST, WAS SENTENCED TO SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS </p><p>FOR WEAPONS AND DRUG POSSESSION.  HIS CRIMES WERE TREATED AS AN </p><p>ORDINARY CRIMINAL CASE EVEN THOUGH THEY STEMMED FROM EARLIER </p><p>TERRORIST-RELATED CHARGES.  BALAFAS REMAINS FREE ON BAIL WHILE HE </p><p>APPEALS HIS CASE. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S VISIT TO </p><p>GREECE, NOVEMBER 19-20, A SERIES OF EXPLOSIVE OR INCENDIARY </p><p>ATTACKS (AGAIN, SOME OF WHICH DEFUSED) AND DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS </p><p>TARGETED U.S., OTHER FOREIGN, AND GREEK BANKS AND BUSINESSES, AS </p><p>WELL AS A POST OFFICE, THE GREEK-AMERICAN UNION, THE OFFICE OF A </p><p>FORMER MINISTER OF PUBLIC ORDER FROM THE OPPOSITION NEW DEMOCRACY </p><p>PARTY, AND A COMMUNIST PARTY BRANCH OFFICE.  THE "TEAM FOR ANTI- </p><p>STATE ACTION" TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOME OF THESE THE ATTACKS. </p><p>THERE WERE NO ARRESTS. </p><p> </p><p>DURING COMMUNIST-ORGANIZED DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE EVENING OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S ARRIVAL, ABOUT 75 TO 80 PEOPLE FIREBOMBED OR LOOTED </p><p>ALMOST 90 BUSINESSES IN DOWNTOWN ATHENS.  THE POLICE ARRESTED </p><p>ABOUT 30 INDIVIDUALS.  FOUR BOMB THREATS WERE ALSO CALLED INTO </p><p>THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>STAY THERE.  IN ADDITION, AN UNIDENTIFIED RADIO OPERATOR SIGNALED </p><p>TO AIR FORCE ONE SHORTLY AFTER THE PRESIDENT\'S DEPARTURE FROM </p><p>ATHENS THAT A BOMB HAD BEEN PLACED ON THE AIRCRAFT.  THREE MORE </p><p>THREATS OF A BOMB OR ROCKET ATTACK ON THE AIRCRAFT WERE PHONED IN </p><p>SHORTLY BEFORE ITS TAKE-OFF.  ALL THESE THREATS PROVED TO BE </p><p>HOAXES. </p><p> </p><p>BURNS </p><p></p></div>
