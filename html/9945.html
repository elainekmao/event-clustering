<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, PHSA, EFIS, EWWT, PTER, PREL, PGOV, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: Vietnam:  Pirates in the Gulf of Thailand </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  During a courtesy call on the Kien Giang </p><p>provincial People\'s Committee, Ambassador Burghardt asked </p><p>Chairman Bui Ngoc Suong and Vice Chairman Van Ha Phong for </p><p>their views on reports of increasing maritime piracy in the </p><p>Gulf of Thailand and the impact on Vietnamese fishermen. </p><p>Noting that the majority of cases involved Cambodian </p><p>criminal elements, Chairman Suong indicated that pirates </p><p>from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have also been </p><p>implicated in attacks on Vietnamese fishermen. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  According to the Chairman, there are no measures </p><p>currently in place to effectively control piracy on the Gulf </p><p>of Thailand.  One important contributing factor has to do </p><p>with the lack of a definitive maritime border between </p><p>Vietnam and Cambodia.  As a result, Vietnamese fishermen </p><p>often stray into what Cambodian considers its waters in </p><p>search of more profitable catches.  These fishermen view the </p><p>threat of piracy as a small price to pay, especially since </p><p>most acts of piracy consist of holding fishing boats and </p><p>their crews hostage while ransom demands are worked out with </p><p>the families.  While ransom demands might start as high as </p><p>15 million VND (USD$1000), they can often be negotiated down </p><p>to a more manageable 5 million VND (USD$330).  According to </p><p>the Chairman, chances for greater enforcement from the </p><p>Cambodian side seemed unlikely, as many of the pirates from </p><p>across the border appear to be law enforcement officers from </p><p>the coast guard, border guard, or fisheries management </p><p>agency.  Last year, Vietnamese forces arrested one Cambodian </p><p>lieutenant and shot another (affiliations unknown) for acts </p><p>of piracy. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Kien Giang province, located in southwestern </p><p>Vietnam, shares a 56-kilometer land border with Cambodia and </p><p>a long history of maritime disputes in the Gulf of Thailand. </p><p>Problems have likely been exacerbated recently due to </p><p>increased fishing as the province seeks to actively develop </p><p>its seafood production capabilities. Income generated from </p><p>fishing accounts for 30 percent of Kien Giang\'s seafood </p><p>products industry - an industry which generated over 2.5 </p><p>billion VND ($163 million USD) in revenue last year and </p><p>represented 50 percent of all exports from the province. </p><p>With Kien Giang alone accounting for 11 percent of Vietnam\'s </p><p>total output in this sector, an increase in the incidents of </p><p>maritime piracy may have the potential to threaten more than </p><p>just the livelihoods of a few fishermen, but for now </p><p>provincial officials seem resigned to accept the status quo. </p><p> </p><p>WHITE </p><p></p></div>
