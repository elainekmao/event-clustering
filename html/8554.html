<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 GUATEMALA 001464 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CEN AND CA/OCS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, ELAB, PHUM, SOCI, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMCIT LAND DISPUTE IN ALTA VERAPAZ </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 884 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  "Finca Esmeralda," a coffee farm in Alta </p><p>Verapaz province owned by Carlos Ardebol, and AmCit, has been </p><p>occupied since February by organized landless peasants who </p><p>have damaged personal property and prevented the return of </p><p>the Ardebol family.  There are of over 40 such occupations by </p><p>peasants in the province, several of which involve the </p><p>Ardebol family.  While Ardebol appeals to the courts to </p><p>defend his right to property, his family has abandoned the </p><p>property for the capital, fearing for their security.  Since </p><p>being notified by the Ardebol family of this land dispute in </p><p>February, the Embassy has actively pursued resolution of the </p><p>case.  On February 12, responding to the initial occupation, </p><p>PolOff contacted the occupying campesino group leader to </p><p>express concern over AmCit safety and property rights; on </p><p>March 17 EconCouns accompanied the Ardebols to a session with </p><p>campesino lawyers at the land dispute agency (CONTIERRA); on </p><p>March 27 ConGen met with Carlos Ardebol and the </p><p>representative of the peasant organization in Coban, the </p><p>provincial capital; and on March 31, the Ambassador raised </p><p>the case with the Minister of Government (RefTel), who </p><p>pledged to investigate property damage and to act quickly on </p><p>any court-ordered dislodgment order.  On April 30, PolOff </p><p>learned of ongoing Government efforts to mediate the case </p><p>through dialogue with the squatters.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Status of Case </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  PolOff spoke on April 30 with Eric Gonzalez, CONTIERRA\'s </p><p>Coban representative to inquire about the status of the Finca </p><p>Esmeralda case and to express concern about the forcible </p><p>entry and trashing of Carlos Ardebol\'s house.  According to </p><p>Gonzalez, CONTIERRA held a successful meeting on this </p><p>conflict on April 29, in which Carlos Ardebol and CONIC </p><p>representatives (Mario Garcia and Hector, but not Arturo </p><p>Chok, who could not make it) agreed to the following measures: </p><p> </p><p>--  Ardebol will suspend demands in the criminal courts while </p><p>pursing dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>--  CONIC will conduct an investigation into the damages to </p><p>Ardebol\'s personal property. </p><p> </p><p>--  Ardebol will develop an inventory of his possessions and </p><p>his own report on the damage. </p><p> </p><p>-- Both sides will next meet on May 15 at CONTIERRA for </p><p>further mediation.  Members of the community which claims the </p><p>right to passage through the ranch on private roads will also </p><p>attend, and more fundamental issues about the occupation </p><p>(which continues) will be discussed. </p><p> </p><p>PolOff congratulated Gonzalez for these results, expressed </p><p>concern for the Ardebol\'s property rights as U.S. citizens, </p><p>and told him the Embassy will be in touch after May 15 to </p><p>hear how that meeting goes. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  On February 11, EconCouns and LabAtt met with Mrs. </p><p>Ardebol and her adult sons (Carlos and Roger).  EconCouns </p><p>told them he had raised their security concerns with the Vice </p><p>Minister of Government.  They had had no contact or other </p><p>evidence of follow-through.  LabAtt told the Ardebols he had </p><p>raised similar concerns with the national campesino </p><p>coordination organization (CONIC).  The Ardebols explained </p><p>that they had decades-old problems with which they were </p><p>dealing satisfactorily and new, CONIC inspired problems </p><p>involving people not originally from the area.  Violence and </p><p>threats appeared with CONIC, they claimed.  The new problems </p><p>date back a couple of months, no more.  They said that their </p><p>case was similar to others in Alta Verapaz, which has </p><p>experienced a spate of land occupations over the past year. </p><p>They claim that they provide right of way on the road through </p><p>their land (which we had heard was an issue for a neighboring </p><p>town) but were increasingly being harassed when they closed </p><p>the road for the night. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Ardebols say that they have clear title to most of </p><p>the land they claim, some if it going back within the family </p><p>for over one hundred years.  Some dual-title land was </p><p>reportedly cleared in their favor by CONTIERRA, with whom </p><p>they have been in continuing contact.  The Ardebols claim </p><p>several properties in San Miguel Tucuru, Alta Verapaz </p><p>province, including finca Esmeralda, Finca Bella Vista, and </p><p>Finca Coyocte. </p><p>Embassy Expresses Concern About AmCit Safety </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  On February 12 PolOff spoke with Juan Tiney, CONIC\'s </p><p>national leader, and again expressed Embassy concern for the </p><p>safety of the Ardebol family as American citizens.  PolOff </p><p>explained the Embassy\'s responsibility to protect U.S. </p><p>citizen property rights.  Threats to the Ardebol\'s security </p><p>came from campesinos blocking a road on Finca Coycote </p><p>approximately a month ago.  The Ardebols are committed to </p><p>dialogue and negotiation as a means to resolve campesino </p><p>claims to their land.  PolOff urged CONIC to attend a meeting </p><p>to be held in Coban to discuss the dispute, hosted by the </p><p>authorities.  The Ardebol\'s are alarmed by reports that </p><p>campesinos organized by CONIC have recently occupied Finca </p><p>Bella Vista, and claim that tension and threats have </p><p>increased since CONIC appeared in the area, mentioning </p><p>specifically CONIC regional organizer Miguel Perez Chiquin. </p><p>The land and labor courts are the proper venues for land and </p><p>labor claims.  Political dialogue is possible through the </p><p>National Roundtable on Agrarian Conflict to be conducted on </p><p>February 13 by the Presidential Secretary for Agrarian Issues. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Tiney responded that he understood Embassy concerns, and </p><p>that he gave similar priority to security of members of </p><p>CONIC.  He repeated assurances that CONIC does not and will </p><p>not threaten the security of anyone, but said that "properly </p><p>announced" measures such as road blockades must be respected. </p><p> He expressed appreciation that the Embassy was involving </p><p>itself in this issue, and urged us to tell American citizens </p><p>to respect Guatemalan law and labor obligations.  He claimed </p><p>that the occupation of Finca Bella Vista involves former </p><p>workers there who had not been paid mandatory severance by </p><p>the Ardebols.  After the GOG refused to take responsibility </p><p>by accepting CONIC\'s Agrarian Platform proposal, campesinos </p><p>occupied the finca to demand land in lieu of what they are </p><p>legally owed.  CONIC would be pleased to attend the meeting </p><p>in Coban on February 21 if invited, he said; the National </p><p>Roundtable meeting is "just a show" and CONIC was undecided </p><p>whether to attend. </p><p> </p><p>EconCouns Meets with CONTIERRA on Dispute </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  On March 17, EconCouns arranged a call on the Director </p><p>General of CONTIERRA, Gustavo Ciraiz, and arrived to find </p><p>himself in a meeting including the Ardebols and lawyers from </p><p>CONIC.  CONTIERRA (somewhat reluctantly) supported the </p><p>Ardebol\'s allegation that CONIC-associated campesinos were </p><p>acting outside the law, destroying property, and "torpedoing" </p><p>(CONTIERRA\'s word) a peaceful resolution.  CONIC lawyers </p><p>backed off their original position and admitted that excesses </p><p>had occurred and undertook to look into matters.  CONIC\'s </p><p>lawyers asked the Ardebol\'s for information on any </p><p>destruction or other problems caused by the campesinos.  They </p><p>made some surprisingly condescending statements about </p><p>campesinos\' ability to understand the legal points and the </p><p>ease with which they could be whipped up by politically </p><p>motivated leaders who did not necessarily have their best </p><p>interest at heart.  CONIC lawyers also admitted (at the end) </p><p>that Ardebols had made good faith efforts to resolve old </p><p>problems and may have good points with current ones. </p><p> </p><p>8.  CONIC\'s lawyers stated that they were part of a pressure </p><p>group that sought solutions, when necessary, "outside of </p><p>normal legal means."  EconCouns laid a polite but firm marker </p><p>that the U.S. Constitution and Guatemala\'s gave no quarter to </p><p>"pressure" for deciding issues of private property ownership. </p><p> He questioned the need to "negotiate" property ownership </p><p>when it was likely that administrative and/or legal processes </p><p>would determine, without doubt, who had legal title. </p><p>EconCouns applauded CONTIERRA\'s efforts to finish its land </p><p>registry research quickly and conduct a "mini-cadaster" of </p><p>the area to back it up.  Perhaps negotiations would be useful </p><p>once the research was finished and areas of legitimate </p><p>uncertainty were identified, he said. </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador\'s Meeting with Minister of Government </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>9.  RefTel reports the Ambassador\'s request to Minister of </p><p>Government Reyes Calderon in a meeting on March 31 to </p><p>investigate the forcible entry and property destruction on </p><p>the Ardebol property, and the Minister\'s pledge to act as </p><p>soon as a court rules authorizes it. </p><p> </p><p>Consul General Finds Common Ground </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  ConGen Jacobsen and PolOff met with Carlos Ardebol, </p><p>CONIC and CONTIERRA/Coban on March 27 to discuss the Finca </p><p>Esmeralda case.  ConGen received assurances from all parties </p><p>of their willingness to meet to discuss peaceful resolution </p><p>of this land dispute. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Carlos Ardebol told ConGen that he remains cut off from </p><p>access to his farm, located an hour from Coban, and that he </p><p>and his family have relocated temporarily to Guatemala City. </p><p>He filed a complaint with the local office of the Public </p><p>Ministry about the damage to his household goods by squatters </p><p>(he showed us pictures of the inside of his farmhouse, which </p><p>had ransacked).  Though he is seeking intervention by the MP, </p><p>Ardebol is realistic about prospects for police action, and </p><p>was also meeting with MINUGUA and local representatives of </p><p>the Human Rights Ombudsman\'s office.  He said he would be </p><p>willing to meet with CONIC\'s local organizers if CONTIERRA </p><p>calls a new meeting.  He agreed to permit ConGen to share his </p><p>cell phone number with CONIC to facilitate direct </p><p>communication. </p><p> </p><p>12.  ConGen and PolOff then met at CONTIERRA\'s Coban offices </p><p>with Arturo Chok, CONIC\'s local organizer responsible for the </p><p>Finca Esmeralda dispute.  EmbOffs expressed USG concern about </p><p>the security of U.S. citizens, the violation by squatters of </p><p>his right to property, and the needless destruction of his </p><p>personal effects.  Chok admitted with bowed head that he was </p><p>"aware of what happened at the Ardebol\'s house" and that </p><p>"this is not what CONIC stands for."  Later, Chok said he was </p><p>not sure who had trashed the house and put up the CONIC </p><p>banner now hanging on the Ardebol\'s property warning people </p><p>to stay out, saying "outsiders" may have been responsible. </p><p>CONIC does not support such measures, he said.  CONIC does </p><p>support the claims of the squatters to land, which involves </p><p>"historic" rights to free passage, which he distinguished </p><p>from the "legal" rights asserted by the Ardebols.  ConGen </p><p>told Chok that the USG and the Embassy are involved in many </p><p>initiatives in support of human and labor rights in </p><p>Guatemala, including US visas, so CONIC\'s aggression against </p><p>an AmCit could have repercussions far beyond Coban. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Asked by PolOff if he would be willing to meet with </p><p>Ardebol, Chok said he would do so, under CONTIERRA\'s </p><p>auspices, as long as the right of free access (to a road the </p><p>Ardebol\'s built through their property) is also up for </p><p>discussion.  We passed him Ardebol\'s contact information.  In </p><p>Chok\'s presence, we thanked CONTIERRA (Carlos Echeverria) for </p><p>its recent efforts to bring the parties to this dispute </p><p>together and requested that a new attempt be made. </p><p>Echeverria agreed to raise this request with his boss, </p><p>Eduardo Gonzalez.  PolOff then called Carlos Ardebol and </p><p>conveyed Chok\'s offer to meet under CONTIERRA\'s auspices, and </p><p>suggested he contact Gonzalez. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The issue of AmCit safety is covered for the moment: </p><p>the Ardebol family is in Guatemala City, far from Coban, and </p><p>Ardebol said only he makes forays into Coban as he pursues </p><p>this issue. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The land title issue is complicated, but not as </p><p>complicated as CONTIERRA is making it.  The documents show </p><p>that the family bought a number of adjacent parcels of land </p><p>one-by-one and then consolidated them into two different </p><p>farms.  However, a poorly delineated land grant from the </p><p>1800s forms the basis for 59 small plots occupied by </p><p>non-Ardebols, and the plots are not now adjacent to one </p><p>another.  These plots have migrated and grown over time and, </p><p>together, account for substantially more than the original </p><p>land grant.  Issues of adverse possession (squatters rights) </p><p>probably apply.  The Ardebols accept that some negotiation </p><p>will be necessary to resolve this once CONTIERRA establishes </p><p>who is on what plot where.  They would like to clarify title </p><p>to what is and isn\'t theirs and, probably, sell to others the </p><p>portions in the area that are still theirs. </p><p> </p><p>16.  The good news is that the GOG has not overreacted to the </p><p>growing land occupation movement by resorting to the use of </p><p>force, which could inflame the situation.  The bad news is </p><p>that the GOG has not acted at all, from the Ardebol\'s </p><p>perspective.  CONTIERRA\'s machinations to determine title </p><p>issues have moved at a snail\'s pace, while the Ardebol\'s </p><p>property rights continue to be violated by squatters as </p><p>efforts to enforce eviction orders come to naught.  In this </p><p>situation, dialogue and negotiation still offer an </p><p>alternative means of dispute resolution, but the Ardebol\'s </p><p>patience could soon run out.  We will continue to monitor and </p><p>advocate progress in this case. </p><p>MCFARLAND </p><p></p></div>
