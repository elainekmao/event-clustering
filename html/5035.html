<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000059 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS, INL </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OIA, AFMLS, AND NDDS </p><p>TREASURY FOR FINCEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, EFIN, PGOV, PREL, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  2002-2003 International Narcotics Control </p><p>Strategy Report (INSCR) Part II Financial Crimes and Money </p><p>Laundering - Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) 02 STATE 240035 </p><p>(B) 02 COLOMBO 2314 </p><p>(C) 02 COLOMBO 2304 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Provided below is response to ref A request for </p><p>information on Sri Lanka\'s regulations and practices </p><p>regarding financial crimes and money laundering. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Sri Lanka is neither an important regional financial </p><p>center nor a preferred center for money laundering.  There </p><p>is no significant market for black market goods. </p><p>Government policy and practice do not encourage or </p><p>facilitate laundering proceeds from illegal drug </p><p>transactions, serious crimes or terrorist financing.  While </p><p>Sri Lanka recently experienced a failure of a small savings </p><p>bank due to fraud by senior bank officials, there has been </p><p>no evidence linking their activities to money laundering or </p><p>terrorist financing.  Nothing suggests that Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>financial institutions engage in currency transactions </p><p>involving international narcotics trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>Money laundering </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Money laundering per se is not a criminal offence.  As </p><p>of January 2003, a draft law to deal with money laundering </p><p>has been approved by the Central Bank and sent to the </p><p>Ministry of Justice for review and presentation to cabinet </p><p>and parliament.  Currently, financial transactions relating </p><p>to terrorism and narcotics are illegal under Central Bank </p><p>regulations and Bank Secrecy laws.  In December 2001, the </p><p>Central Bank introduced regulations on customer due </p><p>diligence.  However, the Central Bank continues to allow </p><p>the operation of bearer certificates (i.e. nameless </p><p>certificates of deposits). </p><p> </p><p>Terrorist Finance </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Based on UN Regulation 1 of 2001 (made by the Minister </p><p>of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka on October 16, 2001) </p><p>terrorist financing is an offense punishable by </p><p>imprisonment for a period of 5 to 10 years.  The Central </p><p>Bank of Sri Lanka has circulated the list of individuals </p><p>and entities that have been included on the UN 1267 </p><p>Sanctions Committee\'s consolidated list with instructions </p><p>to identify, freeze and seize terrorist assets.  To date no </p><p>such assets have been identified.  Sri Lanka has signed the </p><p>1999 convention for the suppression of the financing of </p><p>terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>Offshore financial centers </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Sri Lanka is not considered an offshore financial </p><p>center.  Offshore banking units are allowed to operate as a </p><p>part of a commercial bank operating in the country in order </p><p>to facilitate trade finance.   They are subject to Central </p><p>Bank supervision.  Bearer shares are not permitted for </p><p>banks and companies. </p><p> </p><p>International Cooperation </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Sri Lanka is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and </p><p>the 1999 international convention for the suppression of </p><p>terrorist financing. </p><p> </p><p>Asset forfeiture and seizure legislation </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Regulations under the United Nations Act no 45 of 1968 </p><p>provide for freezing and forfeiture of assets of financiers </p><p>of terrorism.  There is no specific provision in law to </p><p>freeze and forfeit narcotics related assets.  Trafficking, </p><p>possessing, importing or exporting of narcotics is </p><p>punishable by death or life imprisonment under the Poisons, </p><p>Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (OPDDO).  Draft </p><p>amendments to OPDDO and a separate draft money-laundering </p><p>bill are expected to include asset forfeiture and seizure </p><p>provisions for narcotics related crimes and money </p><p>laundering. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
