ANKARA 2616 </p><p>     B. STATE 101170 </p><p>     C. KUWAIT 1547 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Francis </p><p>Ward for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) This cable contains action requests for the </p><p>Department/CENTCOM. </p><p>See paras 9 and 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Summary:  MFA has delayed the Turkish Red Crescent\'s </p><p>planned delivery </p><p>of aid to Iraq to April 28, but expanded it from medicines </p><p>only to include </p><p>food and water.  Media and parliamentarians may travel with </p><p>the convoy, </p><p>which is not approved by the ICRC.  MFA has asked whether it </p><p>can or </p><p>should provide its own military security for the convoy.  The </p><p>Turkish Red </p><p>Crescent informed ICRC separately of the shipment.  Embassy </p><p>requests that </p><p>preliminary information on the convoy be passed to the HOC, </p><p>CMOC and DART. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On April 24, Feza Ozturk, MFA Head of Department for </p><p>International </p><p>Political Organizations, told Mission Disaster Relief Officer </p><p>(MDRO) that </p><p>MFA and the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) had decided to </p><p>postpone to the </p><p>early morning of April 28 and to expand the scope of the </p><p>proposed aid </p><p>shipment for Iraq (ref A).  The Turks plan to send a total of </p><p>12 vehicles </p><p>(5 trucks, 4 ambulances, 2 communications vehicles, 1 </p><p>Volkswagen minibus) </p><p>carrying medical supplies, food, and water to hospitals in </p><p>Mosul and Kirkuk. </p><p>Up to 28 persons, including two (unidentified) members of </p><p>Parliament and at </p><p>least one media representative (from TRT - state </p><p>radio/television), will </p><p>travel in the convoy.  MFA anticipates a one or two day </p><p>presence in Iraq, </p><p>except for the ambulances and their staff which might stay on </p><p>for three to </p><p>four days.  Ozturk stated frankly that this would be done </p><p>with or without </p><p>the approval of the International Committee of the Red Cross </p><p>(ICRC), though </p><p>he said that MFA would inform the ICRC of its plans.  He </p><p>related that this </p><p>decision had been made by the Prime Minister.  MFA will send </p><p>complete details </p><p>to Embassy on this convoy by April 25. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) MDRO advised Ozturk that neither the Disaster </p><p>Assistance Response </p><p>Team (DART) nor the Civil Military Operations Center (CMOC) </p><p>were prepared </p><p>to identify hospitals in need of medical supplies at this </p><p>point, and that </p><p>they strongly recommended coordination of aid with the ICRC. </p><p>He also passed </p><p>on the DART/CMOC assessment that areas north/east of the </p><p>green line were </p><p>permissive, as is Kirkuk.  Mosul is not currently fully </p><p>permissive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) MDRO asked Ozturk whether the donors had verified </p><p>that Mosul and </p><p>Kirkuk hospitals were in need of and willing to accept these </p><p>supplies. </p><p>Ozturk responded that MFA had not checked, but would do so. </p><p>However, he </p><p>stated that he assumed that all hospitals in Iraq were in </p><p>need of this </p><p>kind of aid. Note:  Ozturk did not identify the hospitals by </p><p>name, but </p><p>said that the convoy would deliver all materials to the </p><p>"largest state </p><p>hospitals" in Mosul and Kirkuk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Security:  Ozturk reiterated Turkey\'s offer to provide </p><p>its own </p><p>security (Turkish Special Forces) for the convoy if the U.S. </p><p>side believed </p><p>that the situation surrounding this aid shipment was not </p><p>secure.  Ozturk </p><p>also stated that the Turkish side would inform the KDP and </p><p>PUK of its </p><p>intention to send this convoy.  MDRO responded that he would </p><p>check this </p><p>"offer" with Task Force North and get back to MFA.  Task </p><p>Force North </p><p>maintains that no Turkish military forces of any kind should </p><p>enter Iraq </p><p>to escort the convoy.  MDRO will report this to MFA on April </p><p>28. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) ICRC\'s View:  Finn Ruda, ICRC Regional </p><p>Representative, told MDRO </p><p>that ICRC had offered the Turks several options for delivery </p><p>of aid through </p><p>ICRC channels during the week of April 28, but that TRC </p><p>preferred to go it </p><p>alone.  However, Ruda was informed that TRC planned to send </p><p>its convoy on </p><p>April 25.  Note:  MDRO subsequently confirmed that TRC plans </p><p>to send the </p><p>convoy April 28, not/not April 25.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Requests: </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Embassy requests that information on this convoy be </p><p>shared with the </p><p>Humanitarian Operations Center in Kuwait, as well as the CMOC </p><p>and DART team </p><p>in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) We note in ref C information that CENTCOM would </p><p>support efforts by </p><p>other coalition partners to "adopt" hospitals in Iraq and ask </p><p>whether CENTCOM </p><p>can recommend a hospital to be paired with the Turks. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
