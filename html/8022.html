He said the U.S. </p><p>supported the peace talks between the government and </p><p>the Maoists.  He expressed hope that the peace talks </p><p>would be able to bring the insurgents into the system. </p><p>The ambassador said it would not be in the interest of </p><p>the Maoists to go back into the jungle.  He said the </p><p>U.S. interest in Nepal now was greater than ever </p><p>because of the crisis in the country.  Now the funds </p><p>set aside for Nepal have reached $38 million, the </p><p>highest for a single year.

(Editorial in </p><p>centrist "Nispakshya," V/W, 5/6) </p><p> </p><p>-- "Many people have not been surprised with America </p><p>putting the Maoists in its terrorist list.  In fact, </p><p>most Nepalis consider the Maoists as terrorists.  The </p><p>government has begun talks with them not because they </p><p>are popular among the people or their political </p><p>ideology is acceptable.  The main purpose of the talks </p><p>is to disarm them and to end terrorism inflicted by </p><p>them with the help of weapons.  The Maoists\' activities </p><p>have been full of terror and they should be called </p><p>terrorists.  America has said what it has seen. </p><p>There\'s no need to frown over."
