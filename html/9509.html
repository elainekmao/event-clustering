<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 003304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/21/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY: EU/EUROMED INFORMAL TRADE </p><p>MINISTERIAL, PALERMO, JULY 6-7, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Economic Counselor Karen Milliken for reasons 1.5 b and </p><p>d </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Italian trade officials hosted an informal trade </p><p>ministerial meeting in Palermo July 6-7. The July 6 session </p><p>included trade ministers from the EU 15 plus the 10 EU </p><p>accession countries, as well as European Commissioner for </p><p>External Trade Pascal Lamy and European Free Trade Agreement </p><p>partners, in a discussion that focused on the upcoming WTO </p><p>ministerial meeting in Cancun and with EU enlargement. The </p><p>July 7 session, the Third Euro-Mediterranean trade </p><p>ministerial conference, included trade officials from the </p><p>EU\'s 10 Mediterranean partners (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, </p><p>Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and the </p><p>Palestinian Authority). Trade facilitation and liberalization </p><p>of trade in services were among the issues discussed at the </p><p>Euromed meeting. </p><p> </p><p>Informal EU Trade Ministerial </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Embassy trade contacts, including Federico Eichberg, </p><p>senior advisor to Foreign Trade Vice Minister Adolfo Urso, </p><p>told econoff that an atmosphere of relief and optimism </p><p>permeated the July 6 meeting of EU and EU accession country </p><p>ministers, following the agreement in late June on CAP </p><p>reform.  The EU no longer is on the defensive regarding the </p><p>lack of CAP reform, and thus being potentially blamed for </p><p>creating gridlock at the WTO ministerial meeting in </p><p>September.  No decision was made to table a new agriculture </p><p>proposal ) Eichberg stressed that CAP reform makes future </p><p>export subsidy cuts doable, even if no decision has been made </p><p>about their potential size. Predictably, Italy also </p><p>emphasized increased protection under the WTO for </p><p>geographical indications for all food products; however, our </p><p>contact admitted that it might not be possible to achieve any </p><p>progress on GI expansion by Cancun. Nevertheless, the EU will </p><p>push to conclude talks at Cancun on GI protection for wine </p><p>and spirits. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) No changes to the EU,s approach on other Doha round </p><p>issues were made at the Palermo meeting, according to </p><p>ministry contacts and other reports we have seen.  On </p><p>non-agricultural market access the EU remains generally </p><p>pleased with the Trade Negotiating Committee,s draft paper, </p><p>but foresees the need for further work to bring developing </p><p>countries onboard.  The EU will continue to push for all four </p><p>Singapore issues to be negotiated together (Italy is </p><p>particularly interested in the investment issue).  Resolution </p><p>at/before Cancun of the TRIPS/medicine issue is seen as </p><p>essential for the perceived success of the ministerial. </p><p>Eichberg recalled no mention of deadlines, and said Lamy </p><p>remains optimistic regarding a timely conclusion to the Doha </p><p>Round. </p><p>4. (SBU) Eichberg noted that, contrary to some press reports, </p><p>no U.S.-EU bilateral trade disputes were discussed at the </p><p>July 6 meeting.  He said much of the meeting,s content </p><p>concerned modalities for the ten EU accession countries to </p><p>integrate into the EU process on developing/implementing </p><p>trade policy.  Italy also presented a proposal to make marks </p><p>of origin obligatory within the EU, with the goal of giving </p><p>EU consumers important information regarding a product,s </p><p>country of origin.  Eichberg commented that there was little </p><p>discussion at Palermo on the proposal (though he said Lamy </p><p>was supportive), and Italy does not expect the proposal to </p><p>advance significantly in the near term, given the press of </p><p>the WTO round. </p><p> </p><p>Euromed Meeting </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Eichberg noted some positive news from the July 7 </p><p>Euromed meeting, especially the adoption of a protocol on </p><p>rules of origin for the EU, Mediterranean, acceding </p><p>countries, and EFTA (which he termed one of the more </p><p>significant achievements since the Barcelona Process began). </p><p>In addition to facilitating trade, the new protocol will </p><p>contribute to continuing efforts to forge a Euromed free </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>trade area.  Eichberg also noted a positive atmosphere among </p><p>all the Euromed participants, including between the Israeli </p><p>and Palestinian contingents. The GOI informally proposed some </p><p>joint operations among Italy,s Simest (analogous to OPIC) </p><p>and relevant Israeli and Palestinian entities. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Despite the positive atmosphere at Palermo, however, </p><p>Eichberg was pessimistic about the Barcelona Process ever </p><p>achieving significant trade expansion between the EU and the </p><p>Mediterranean basin countries, given the different economic </p><p>development levels between the two areas.  European interest </p><p>in expanding into central and eastern Europe over the last </p><p>decade overrode earlier hopes for attracting more EU </p><p>investment to the south. Eichberg pointed out that Simest </p><p>attracts very little interest among potential Italian </p><p>investors in projects in the ten Euromed partners, despite </p><p>its willingness to underwrite such investments. The economic </p><p>counselor of the Egyptian Embassy in Rome shared with us </p><p>similar concerns about Euromed, noting a general </p><p>disillusionment among the ten that significant progress, much </p><p>less a free trade area, will ever gain traction.  Our </p><p>Egyptian colleague agreed that EU investors &abandoned8 the </p><p>Mediterranean in favor of eastern Europe after the end of the </p><p>cold war. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03304 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
