(SBU) Despite the recent change in government, the </p><p>Commission for Investigation into the Abuse of Authority </p><p>(CIAA), the autonomous constitutional body charged with </p><p>prosecuting corruption, is continuing to pursue a number of </p><p>high-profile cases against several former ministers and </p><p>prominent civil servants.  The CIAA can employ sweeping </p><p>powers of investigation and prosecution unparalleled by other </p><p>government agencies, and its zeal dovetails with the interim </p><p>government\'s emphasis on good governance.  A public long </p><p>disenchanted by flagrant and widespsread corruption at the </p><p>highest levels of government has so far overwhelmingly </p><p>welcomed the probes.  A Department of Justice program to </p><p>train prosecutors for corruption cases, scheduled to take </p><p>place in Kathmandu from November 18-22, is particularly well </p><p>timed. To maintain the credibility and reputation for </p><p>independence it now enjoys, the CIAA must remain careful to </p><p>keep its investigations non-partisan and balanced.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>CORRUPTION QUERIES CONTINUE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  When the Commission for the Investigation into the </p><p>Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the autonomous constitutional body </p><p>charged with prosecuting official corruption, began </p><p>investigating corruption charges against 22 mid-level civil </p><p>servants--most from the Department of Customs and Ministry of </p><p>Finance--in August (Ref A), many observers hoped that </p><p>inquiries into the activities of even more prominent </p><p>personalities would follow.  Since then the agency, armed </p><p>with the interim goverment\'s mandate to tackle corruption and </p><p>restore good governance, has followed up these initial probes </p><p>with a series of inquiries aimed at several high-ranking </p><p>officials in previous administrations, including at least </p><p>three ex-ministers in former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba\'s Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The Commission is questioning former Minister for </p><p>Information and Communications Jaya Prakash Gupta; former </p><p>Minister for Home Affairs Khum Bahadur Khadka; and former </p><p>Minister for Physical Planning and Works Chiranjibi Wagle </p><p>(all from Deuba\'s Nepali Congress government).  Also called </p><p>in for questioning has been Ram Krishna Mainali, a member of </p><p>the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML), </p><p>who had been Minister of Communications in a 1998 coalition </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) So far the inquiries into these former members of </p><p>Deuba\'s Cabinet have focused on actions they took while </p><p>Ministers in previous Nepali Congress governments.  Gupta is </p><p>under investigation for a mobile telephone deal he authorized </p><p>as Communications Minister in 1999 (Mainali is being </p><p>questioned for beginning the deal during his tenure as </p><p>Minister the year before); Khadka for having awarded several </p><p>unbid contracts for projects during his time as Water </p><p>Resources Minister from 1995-1997; and Wagle, along with his </p><p>unemployed son, for having amassed wealth not commensurate </p><p>with the level of his official remuneration.  Also under </p><p>investigation is General Manager of the state-owned (and </p><p>largely bankrupt) Royal Nepal Air Corporation, Ramagya Prasad </p><p>Chaturbedi, for possible corrupt dealings during a previous </p><p>incarnation as General Manager of the state-owned National </p><p>Construction Company; and Ananda Khanal, a former Director </p><p>General for road construction in the Ministry of Physical </p><p>Works. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Paralleling CIAA\'s investigations is the work being </p><p>done by yet another independent body, the Judicial </p><p>Investigation and Probe Commission on Property (JIPC), </p><p>appointed by former PM Deuba in March to assess the value of </p><p>personal assets acknowledged by more than 40,000 current and </p><p>former politicians, Members of Parliament, Ministers, and </p><p>civil servants who have held office since 1990 (Ref C). </p><p>Sources at the JIPC, which has no prosecutorial powers of its </p><p>own, have already indicated to the press that they plan to </p><p>question a multi-partisan group of former ministers, as well </p><p>as Sujata Koirala, the daughter of former Prime Minister G.P. </p><p>Koirala.  If sufficient evidence against the subjects is </p><p>found, the cases will be referred to CIAA for prosecution. </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Former Prime Minister Deuba has told the </p><p>Ambassador that he welcomes CIAA\'s pro-active stance, </p><p>commenting that he "would be relieved" if any former members </p><p>of his Cabinet implicated in corrupt activities were to end </p><p>up being indicted (Ref D).  He added that he considers </p><p>passage of tougher anti-corruption legislation during his </p><p>most recent administration one of his proudest achievements. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>POLITICAL APPOINTEE HEADS OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES AXED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) On October 28 the interim government fired all the </p><p>general managers of the 39 state-owned enterprises.  So far, </p><p>no replacements have been named.  GM positions at the head of </p><p>the state-owned enterprises, most of which are operating in </p><p>the red, have long been regarded as lucrative sinecures for </p><p>well-connected political allies of the party in power, who </p><p>have often treated those corporations as cash cows to fund </p><p>personal and partisan activities.  Although a report by the </p><p>National Planning Commission in 2000 recommended that the SOE </p><p>directors be chosen on the basis of merit and competence, </p><p>rather than patronage and paybacks, no action was taken to </p><p>revamp management. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>CIAA:  BROAD POWERS, KEY MANDATE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The CIAA adopted its more vigorous and visible </p><p>public stance after Parliament passed more stringent </p><p>anti-corruption legislation in April (Ref B), including an </p><p>act that established a Special Court to try corruption cases. </p><p> The new legislation gives the CIAA sweeping authority to </p><p>investigate; conduct searches; examine bank accounts; freeze </p><p>and/or impound assets; charge; and prosecute cases against </p><p>public officials.  The Commission may decide to "pick up </p><p>cases from anywhere," according to Chief Commissioner Surya </p><p>Nath Upadhyay--even an anonymous e-mail, phone call, or </p><p>letter.  At least two of the three Commissioners must decide </p><p>that there is sufficient initial evidence against a suspect </p><p>to begin an investigation. (Note:  CIAA\'s authority does not </p><p>extend to members of the judiciary, the Royal Nepal Army, </p><p>and, of course, the Royal Family.  End note.)  Suspects in a </p><p>CIAA case may be detained for up to six months without </p><p>charge.  The 18 suspects arrested in CIAA\'s initial sweep at </p><p>the Department of Customs and Ministry of Finance in August </p><p>(Ref A) have been held for more than two months. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  The probes seem to have gained in breadth--as well </p><p>as in the height of the positions targeted--since King </p><p>Gyanendra appointed the interim government under Prime </p><p>Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand with a special mandate to </p><p>clean up corruption.  Besides the former Ministers now under </p><p>investigation, the CIAA is contemplating bringing charges </p><p>against a host of other prominent figures from different </p><p>political parties, Upadhyay told the Ambassador in an October </p><p>22 meeting.  For example, the CIAA is examining allegations </p><p>against a former Nepali Congress Home Minister, who </p><p>attributes his excessive wealth to money sent him by his son, </p><p>who now lives in the U.S.  Since the son has apparently been </p><p>out of school for only one year, however, Upadhayay says he </p><p>questions this story.  He asked for U.S. Embassy assistance </p><p>in verifying the son\'s income in the U.S.  (We understand the </p><p>British received a similar request regarding a former UML </p><p>Minister\'s son.)  The Ambassador undertook to extend all </p><p>appropriate assistance. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>DOJ WORKSHOP TIMELY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) The U.S. Department of Justice Office of Overseas </p><p>Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) </p><p>will conduct a one-week workshop in Kathmandu November 18-22 </p><p>aimed at training 35 prosecutors, judges, and policemen in </p><p>dealing with corruption cases.  While this training was </p><p>planned well before these corruption cases hit the front </p><p>pages, the timing of the workshop--just as CIAA appears to be </p><p>gearing up to bring a number of cases before the Special </p><p>Court--is particularly fortuitous. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Most Nepalis believe that corruption, while </p><p>discreetly present during the autocratic Panchayat regime, </p><p>has burgeoned into a free-wheeling growth industry in the 12 </p><p>years since the restoration of democracy.  Whether that </p><p>perception is correct or not, many disenchanted citizens </p><p>associate democracy with the democratiziation of </p><p>rapaciousness and venality.   Demonstrating that a </p><p>constitutional government can stem this pervasive and </p><p>commonplace vice after more than a decade of neglect is a </p><p>near-gargantuan task.  CIAA, at long last, appears to be </p><p>exercising powers broad enough--almost too broad--to meet the </p><p>challenge.  So far, we see no evidence that CIAA intends to </p><p>abuse this power, and are encouraged that it is adopting a </p><p>multi-partisan approach--especially since there seems to be </p><p>ample evidence of guilt on both sides of the aisle. </p><p>Safeguarding this impartiality is obviously key to </p><p>maintaining CIAA\'s credibility, and thus to the success of </p><p>its goals.  As outlined in our Mission Program Plan, the </p><p>Embassy wants to supplement long-delayed Government of Nepal </p><p>efforts to tackle corruption with programs similar to the </p><p>timely OPDAT prosecutoiral training course. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
