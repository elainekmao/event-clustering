<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001432 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR SCHANDLER AND SBOMER </p><p>USDA FOR APHIS AND FAS/DLP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, TBIO, CA, Beef, Agriculture </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA REPORTS FIRST NORTH AMERICA BSE CASE </p><p> </p><p>THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE </p><p>ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Canadian Agriculture Minister Lyle Van Clief notified </p><p>Ambassador on May 20 that the Minister would announce that </p><p>afternoon Canada\'s (and North America\'s) first case of bovine </p><p>spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in an animal not imported </p><p>from Europe.  Agriculture Canada\'s draft press release -- </p><p>faxed to WHA/CAN and USTR -- notes that the Canadian Food </p><p>Inspection Agency (CFIA) has quarantined the farm in northern </p><p>Alberta where Canada\'s ongoing BSE surveillance program had </p><p>identified a suspect animal at slaughter and declared its </p><p>meat unfit to enter the food chain.  The animal was rendered </p><p>and CFIA is now investigating the uses to which its tallow </p><p>and gelatin might have been put (Note: Canada prohibits use </p><p>of bone meal or other byproducts in feed for other ruminant </p><p>animals.  End Note). Specimens from the suspect animal were </p><p>sent to the World Reference Library in the UK, which informed </p><p>the GOC on May 20 that it had verified the presence of BSE. </p><p>CFIA is now tracking down the animal\'s origin, determining </p><p>how its remains were processed and ensuring that it </p><p>identifies all calves originating from the 150-head herd </p><p>Once the entire herd has been tested, it and any other herds </p><p>determined to be at risk will be destroyed. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The GOC has acted quickly to deal with the threat </p><p>BSE poses to the Alberta beef industry and to maintain </p><p>confidence in the CFIA\'s BSE surveillance program.  The </p><p>Minister\'s message to the Ambassador, efforts by Department </p><p>of Foreign Affairs and International Trade officials to touch </p><p>base with USG counterparts and ongoing contacts between CFIA </p><p>and APHIS underscore the Canadians\' understanding that this </p><p>is a North American problem. Canadian officials with whom </p><p>Emboffs have discussed the issue have actively solicited USG </p><p>advice on how best to manage any health or trade fallout from </p><p>this discovery and indicated their willingness to work with </p><p>us to ensure that there are no further cases.  Beef cattle </p><p>and meat products account for 13 percent of Canada\'s </p><p>agricultural exports and 22 percent of ag exports to the U.S. </p><p>(US$ 2.25 billion annually), so the stakes are very high. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: The GOC has been greatly concerned by USG </p><p>plans to implement a Congressionally mandated </p><p>country-of-origin labelling program for beef cattle. </p><p>However, had such a program been in place when this infected </p><p>animal was found, its origin would have been immediately </p><p>evident, saving considerable investigative time and effort. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
