(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Summary And Comment </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment:  General Director of the </p><p>UAE Federal Customs Authority Mohamed Al-Mehairi </p><p>updated Econoff May 6 on negotiations between the UAE </p><p>and Saudi Arabia regarding the alleged harassment by </p><p>Saudi customs officials of local traders exporting </p><p>their goods into KSA (see reftel).  Saudi customs </p><p>officials continue to charge UAE exporters up to a 20 </p><p>percent tariff on goods crossing the UAE-Saudi border, </p><p>even though goods manufactured in the UAE (outside the </p><p>free zones) are technically exempt from tax.  The </p><p>latest meetings May 3-4 to resolve the row ended </p><p>abruptly with both sides walking out, and Al-Mehairi </p><p>vowing not to return to the negotiating table until </p><p>his Saudi counterparts exhibit some flexibility. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Summary and comment continued:  The UAE </p><p>Finance Minister intends to raise the issue at the </p><p>informal meeting of GCC trade ministers this summer, </p><p>but a resolution is likely to occur only if top UAE </p><p>leaders intervene at the formal GCC summit in </p><p>December.  We will seek a meeting with UAE Finance </p><p>Minister Khirbash in the coming weeks to determine </p><p>whether the anti-Saudi vehemence felt at the Federal </p><p>Customs Authority is echoed at the higher levels of </p><p>the UAEG.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>UAE Officials Frustrated By Saudi Obstinacy </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) During the May 3 meeting, Riyadh reportedly </p><p>refused to distinguish between goods manufactured in </p><p>the UAE\'s many free zones (subject to the 12 percent </p><p>tax) and goods that are manufactured in the UAE </p><p>proper.  According to Al-Mehairi, the GCC Secretariat </p><p>conducted a study of the free zones in 2000 that is </p><p>the basis of the UAEG\'s definition of free zone and </p><p>non-free zone manufacturing establishments, but Saudi </p><p>officials would not accept this document. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Saudi officials also demanded that Riyadh send </p><p>its own inspection team to the UAE to determine for </p><p>themselves the location of certain UAE companies, and </p><p>the types of businesses in which they engage.  An </p><p>infuriated Al-Mehairi contended that the UAEG inspects </p><p>and certifies businesses to operate in the UAE, and </p><p>Saudi Arabia has no extraterritorial jurisdiction in </p><p>this matter. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Informal meetings of the negotiators are </p><p>scheduled throughout the next several weeks, but Al- </p><p>Mehairi -- the UAE\'s chief negotiator on customs </p><p>issues -- said he would not attend.  Unlike the SAG, </p><p>the UAEG is seized with the issue; the UAE exports an </p><p>approximate USD $3 billion to Saudi Arabia each year, </p><p>while importing less than USD $700 million in Saudi </p><p>goods.  Al-Mehairi confirmed that the Finance Minister </p><p>would confront Saudi officials at the GCC trade </p><p>ministers round this summer, but "this goes much </p><p>higher than the Finance Minister; all of the shaykhs </p><p>know about this." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>UAE Customs Retaliates... </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In order to make a statement against the Saudi </p><p>position, the Federal Customs Authority undertook on </p><p>May 5 to block all Saudi imports into the UAE for 48 </p><p>hours, according to Al-Mehairi.  After only six hours </p><p>of the embargo, however, unspecified "higher </p><p>authorities" ordered the Federal Customs Authority to </p><p>reopen the border to Saudi traders at the behest of </p><p>and as a display of goodwill to the Saudi royal </p><p>family. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Al-Mehairi recounted numerous recent examples </p><p>of Saudi customs officials unnecessarily delaying UAE </p><p>perishable shipments at the border for three days, and </p><p>allowing the goods to pass only after the expiration </p><p>date printed on the product\'s label had passed.  The </p><p>UAE Finance Ministry has determined that UAE companies </p><p>have needlessly paid USD $3 million in tariffs to </p><p>Saudi officials since the supposed implementation of </p><p>the GCC Customs Union in January. </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>...And Is Likely To Have GCC Support </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The other GCC countries agree that Saudi </p><p>Arabia is not abiding by the terms of the GCC Customs </p><p>Agreement, and have discussed informally if they </p><p>should take collective action against Riyadh, </p><p>according to Al-Mehairi.  The other GCC countries </p><p>already joined forces within the last month to block </p><p>Saudi milk imports, which Al-Mehairi alleges have been </p><p>"dumped" into other GCC markets at less than fair </p><p>market prices.  Al-Mehairi asserted that this Saudi </p><p>milk is not pasteurized and poses a health risk to </p><p>consumers. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Iraq Could Change GCC Dynamics </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Al-Mehairi queried Econoff about plans for </p><p>rebuilding Iraq\'s economy, and noted that a stable, </p><p>secular Iraq probably would be invited to join the GCC </p><p>trading block.  Admitting that such a decision would </p><p>not sit well with Riyadh, Al-Mehairi added that access </p><p>to the mammoth Iraqi market would be the welcomed </p><p>answer to the GCC\'s problems with Saudi Arabia. "If we </p><p>have Iraq, forget Saudi Arabia." </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
