<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001654 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NATO FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, KPKO, AF, IZ, CG, Iraq, Afghanistan </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN MILITARY PREPARING FOR KEY ROLE IN ISAF, </p><p>MAKING MODEST CONTRIBUTIONS IN IRAQ AND CONGO </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) OTTAWA 985 AND PREVIOUS (B) OTTAWA 1190 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) While NATO is assuming the lead for ISAF, Canada will </p><p>join Germany as one of the two largest troop contributors </p><p>beginning in August.  Canada will be providing two rotations </p><p>of 1,800 personnel each for ISAF IV and V.  While Canada will </p><p>not back away from this commitment, it is expressing concern </p><p>about the security situation in Afghanistan and the lack of </p><p>political progress made by the Karzai Government.  Before its </p><p>main ISAF deployment gets underway, Canada is also making </p><p>small military contributions in Iraq and Congo, using CC130 </p><p>aircraft to transport U.S. military personnel into Iraq and </p><p>French military personnel into Congo.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>AFGHANISTAN </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Canada is proceeding with preparations for the </p><p>infantry battle group and brigade staff headquarters it will </p><p>be contributing to ISAF IV and V (ref. A).  There are </p><p>currently 150 Canadian Forces (CF) personnel in Kabul laying </p><p>the groundwork, and the bulk of the CF deployment will take </p><p>place starting in late July.  CF MGEN Andrew Leslie will be </p><p>the Deputy Commander in ISAF headquarters, and will be joined </p><p>there by 15-20 other CF personnel.  CF BGEN Peter Devlin will </p><p>be Commander of the Kabul Multinational Brigade. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) and National Defense (DND) </p><p>contacts tell us that beyond the announced ISAF mission in </p><p>Kabul, Canada is looking at potential CF participation in </p><p>Provincial Reconstruction Teams.  One of the factors they are </p><p>assessing is security, particularly after the recent killing </p><p>of 4 German soldiers.  Canada prefers that the three missions </p><p>going on concurrently in Afghanistan - Operation Enduring </p><p>Freedom, NATO/ISAF, and UN - be brought together.  Canadian </p><p>Defense Minister McCallum will be visiting Kabul June 23-24, </p><p>and Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah will be visiting Ottawa </p><p>in August.  Canada has also announced that it is opening an </p><p>Embassy in Afghanistan, which should be "fully operational" </p><p>by summer 2004.  Canada\'s diplomatic efforts in Kabul are </p><p>currently being handled by TDY personnel from Islamabad. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While Canada will follow through on its ISAF </p><p>commitments, Foreign Minister Graham told reporters on June </p><p>10 that "the anarchy in Afghanistan is clearly a serious </p><p>concern for us."  Our DFAIT contacts noted UN SRSG Brahimi\'s </p><p>recent message in Paris, where he said that the Karzai </p><p>Government is repeating the mistakes of the early 1990s, </p><p>potentially enabling the Taliban to re-establish itself. </p><p>DFAIT expressed concern about the Government\'s inability to </p><p>be more inclusive, about following through on the elections </p><p>timetable, and about what would happen if Karzai was killed. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>IRAQ, CONGO </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Prior to its main ISAF deployment, Canada is also </p><p>making small military contributions in Iraq (ref. A) and the </p><p>Congo.  Canada is using four CC-130 Hercules transport </p><p>aircraft based in the UAE, which previously had been </p><p>dedicated to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  On June 2 and </p><p>8, the CC130s were used to transport U.S. military personnel </p><p>and equipment from Kuwait into Iraq.  On June 9, two of the </p><p>CC130s were deployed to Entebbe, Uganda, where they are being </p><p>used to transport French troops into Bunia, Congo.  Canada </p><p>will devote the two CC-130s to the Congo mission until July </p><p>7, when they will return to the UAE to support the ISAF </p><p>deployment.  Canada will send a fifth CC-130 into theater in </p><p>July to help with the ISAF deployment surge. </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Canadian Government continues to step up to the </p><p>plate in Afghanistan, where it has made significant military </p><p>contributions under OEF and has disbursed US$86 million in </p><p>humanitarian assistance (another US$185 million has been </p><p>committed over the next 2 years).  In Iraq, Canada refused to </p><p>join our military coalition but is providing humanitarian </p><p>assistance, using both military and civilian assets.  Canada </p><p>participated with us in a recent police/judiciary assessment </p><p>team visit to Iraq, and we expect RCMP officers to be </p><p>deployed as part of this effort.  In Congo, Canada\'s military </p><p>contribution is in keeping with Prime Minister Chretien\'s </p><p>push in the G-8 for greater responsiveness to African crises. </p><p> All of these efforts continue to strain the underfunded </p><p>Canadian military, which will have 9% of all available combat </p><p>troops deployed overseas by August. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
