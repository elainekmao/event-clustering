<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000778 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, BM, NLD, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY OFFICERS VISIT RESIDENCES OF DETAINED </p><p>SENIOR NLD OFFCIALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 724 </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 636 </p><p>     C. RANGOON 639 </p><p>     D. RANGOON 768 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ.  REASON:  1.5(B) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  Pol/Econ chief, accompanied by a senior </p><p>Burmese FSN, went to the residences of eight of the ten CEC </p><p>members on June 26.  We found the security at the houses of </p><p>the Central Committee members lax in contrast to 2000, when </p><p>the GOB posted military intelligence agents (MI) and Ministry </p><p>of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officers at the houses of the CEC </p><p>members.  Any easing may have been a result of the GOB not </p><p>believing that we would continue pressing to see the </p><p>detainees in the face of continuing stonewalling by the </p><p>government.  Continued visits by U.S. Embassy officials serve </p><p>to keep not only the GOB, but also the democratic opposition, </p><p>on notice that we will continue to protest what is happening </p><p>here.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  As part of post\'s continuing efforts to gain access </p><p>to members of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the </p><p>National League for Democracy (NLD), Pol/Econ chief, </p><p>accompanied by a senior Burmese FSN, went to the residences </p><p>of eight of the ten CEC members on June 26.  The GOB </p><p>continues to insist publicly they are not under arrest.  Our </p><p>information, gleaned from loose-lipped guards at the gates, </p><p>as well as from conversations with members of the detainees\' </p><p>families, indicates otherwise.  In reality, the detainees are </p><p>under house arrest under the provisions of Section 10 (b) of </p><p>a 1975 law "restraining" them for up to year (Ref A - in </p><p>practice they can be held as long as the GOB sees fit). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  We found the security at the houses of the Central </p><p>Committee members lax in contrast to 2000, when the GOB </p><p>posted military intelligence agents (MI) and Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officers at the houses of the CEC </p><p>members.  The current security is also less than was in place </p><p>in the first few days after the May 30 attack on ASSK and her </p><p>followers in Depeyin, when MI and MOFA were very much in </p><p>evidence when we were barred from entering the houses of </p><p>detained CEC members (Ref B).  Currently, those same houses </p><p>are being watched by low-level local government officials and </p><p>USDA members. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  We did not get a chance to talk to the detained NLD </p><p>leaders, although several looked out from the windows of </p><p>their houses.  We did talk to members of the households of </p><p>several of the detainees and were told that family members </p><p>are being allowed to go in and out of the residences.  From </p><p>the information we gathered from the relatives, it seems the </p><p>detainees are in relatively good health and are allowed </p><p>visits from physicians.  To judge from the reactions of the </p><p>family members, these latest visits were welcome, just as </p><p>before (Ref C).  We will continue these visits as part of our </p><p>ongoing efforts (Ref D) to remind the GOB and the democratic </p><p>opposition, in a public way, that the USG\'s support for the </p><p>NLD  is still strong. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  We took this opportunity to deliver invitations to </p><p>the CEC members for post\'s upcoming Independence Day </p><p>reception, and we were able to leave the invitations with </p><p>members of the household in all but one case.  Post was </p><p>amused to see the French press release announcing that they </p><p>have invited Aung San Suu Kyi and the other detained NLD </p><p>leaders to their Bastille Day ceremony on July 14.  In fact, </p><p>the French have passed their Bastille Day invitations to the </p><p>CEC and ASSK to us for delivery and we will try to deliver </p><p>them next week.  Hopefully, the French will come along. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Comment: The apparent slight easing of security and </p><p>permitting family members access to the detained CEC members </p><p>should not be taken as a sign that detainees will be released </p><p>any time soon.  Any easing may have been a result of the GOB </p><p>not believing that we would continue pressing to see the </p><p>detainees in the face of continuing stonewalling by the </p><p>government.  However, continued visits by U.S. Embassy </p><p>officials serve to keep not only the GOB, but also the </p><p>democratic opposition, on notice that we will continue to </p><p>protest what is happening here.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
