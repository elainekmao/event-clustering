<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001069 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR A/S CARPENTER, PDAS BERGIN, DS/DSS, DS/OP/AF, DS/PSP/FPD, </p><p>DS/DSS/ITA, AF/EX AND AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AEMR, AMGT, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: EAC FINDS NIGERIAN POLICE PRESENCE ESSENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) STATE 81577 </p><p>      B) ABUJA 00909 </p><p>      C) ABUJA 00214 </p><p>      D) Various e-mails between RSO Lagos/Abuja and DS/PSP/FPD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Charge chaired a May 11 meeting of the </p><p>Abuja EAC in response to ref A implication that Nigerian </p><p>Police could not be paid by purchase request after May 31, </p><p>absent a formally-concluded MOA.  EAC members unanimously </p><p>agreed that termination of police coverage would be most </p><p>unwise, as it would materially degrade security of persons </p><p>and information.  Post requests the Department to extend </p><p>permission to use the purchase request to pay Nigerian </p><p>Police officers until the MOA is concluded.  Consulate </p><p>General Lagos will respond separately.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Ref A commences by offering Post information on the </p><p>requirements of the VCDR.  Nigeria\'s National Police Force </p><p>(NPF) is the victim of more than two decades of malign </p><p>neglect at the hands of successive military regimes.  The </p><p>NPF is aware of its responsibilities under the VCDR but is </p><p>woefully short of the resources required to carry them out. </p><p>The NPF notably lacks sufficient vehicles and fuel for the </p><p>cars it has, as well as even rudimentary telecommunications </p><p>capability.  Individual officers are poorly and irregularly </p><p>paid.  This Mission, like most others, pays a stipend to </p><p>the NPF personnel who protect its facilities and people. </p><p>3.  (U) The Abuja EAC finds the Department\'s plan to </p><p>eliminate the stipends, pending signing of a Memorandum of </p><p>Agreement (MOA) by the NPF, a less-than-sensible response </p><p>to the lack of a MOA.  The stipends are intended to cover </p><p>the expenses individual NPF personnel incur in protecting </p><p>our facilities and people.  The NPF personnel use them to </p><p>pay for transportation to the places we want them to work, </p><p>for food during their 24-hour duty shifts, for medicine </p><p>when they get sick, and so forth.  If we stop providing </p><p>these stipends, the NPF personnel will stop working for us. </p><p>These NPF personnel are not the persons holding up the MOA; </p><p>the responsible individuals are desk-bound bureaucrats in </p><p>NPF headquarters (and probably elsewhere) who have little </p><p>or no appreciation for the circumstances under which their </p><p>rank-and-file subordinates must labor.  These bureaucrats </p><p>know their VCDR obligations and are ready to tell us that </p><p>help us just a telephone call away.  Of course, most calls </p><p>either do not go through or go unanswered.  In the rare </p><p>event that a call is answered, the caller is told to send a </p><p>vehicle to pick up the police (who either have no fuel or </p><p>no vehicle).  These bureaucrats really do not care if the </p><p>MOA is never concluded; they do not really oppose it.  It </p><p>just is not a priority.  There are plenty of diplomatic </p><p>missions and private citizens willing to pay for police </p><p>protection.  If we want the MOA, we have to push for it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Abuja RSO has continually met with senior NPF </p><p>officials during the past six months in an effort to gain </p><p>approval of the MOA.  The MOA has passed through several </p><p>offices in the NPF, with the RSO shepherding it forward </p><p>every step of the way.  The NPF recently advised the RSO </p><p>that the MOA was awaiting Foreign Ministry (MFA) approval. </p><p>The DCM raised the issue with a senior MFA official, who </p><p>denied any knowledge of the matter and requested a copy of </p><p>the proposed MOA (actually, two MOAs - one for Abuja and </p><p>one for Lagos).  Post provided the copy and intends to </p><p>follow up with the MFA official during the week of May 14. </p><p>The decision-making process in Nigeria generally moves at a </p><p>torpid pace, with all decisions referred slowly and less </p><p>than steadily up the chain of command of each Ministry </p><p>before being referred to the next.  NPF officials have </p><p>indicated their willingness to sign the MOA(s), and the RSO </p><p>is confident they ultimately will.  The EAC doubts very </p><p>much that signing will take place before the end of May. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The Mission will continue to pursue a signed MOA </p><p>vigorously, raising its importance to us and the benefits </p><p>it offers the NPF on every appropriate occasion.  We are </p><p>prepared to call upon our most senior contacts in the GON </p><p>security hierarchy for intervention if a breakthrough does </p><p>not take place soon.  However, even when these very senior </p><p>contacts intervene, it can take many weeks, perhaps months, </p><p>for their intervention to produce the desired result - so </p><p>obdurate can the Nigerian bureaucracy be. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Eliminating the stipends will not make the Nigerian </p><p>bureaucracy move faster.  What it will do is deny this Post </p><p>the benefit of armed protection.  We have no Marine Guards, </p><p>and our local guard force is unarmed.  We rely on the armed </p><p>NPF personnel to deter those who might seek to do us harm </p><p>or enter our offices forcibly.  If one of our people is in </p><p>an accident or attacked, he or she can call by radio for </p><p>help.  We count on the armed NPF personnel attached to our </p><p>REACT vehicles to respond in emergencies.  Our local guard </p><p>force transports them, but it is the AK-47s and well-known </p><p>black uniforms of the NPF that quiet an angry crowd.  Even </p><p>a minor accident generates a huge crowd that is always </p><p>hostile toward the foreigner involved.  Over and over </p><p>again, the NPF officers assigned to our REACT vehicles have </p><p>proved themselves effective in quelling a hostile crowd. </p><p>Local criminals frequently attack vehicles traveling from </p><p>the airport to the city at night.  NPF officers assigned to </p><p>the REACT vehicles are essential to ensuring the security </p><p>of persons and materials (many classified) being brought </p><p>from the airport into the city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The Charge chaired the EAC meeting, with the </p><p>following sections/agencies represented:  Administration, </p><p>Political, Economic, Consular, PAS, DAO, PAS, USAID, RAO </p><p>and RSO.  All found the proposal to eliminate the stipends </p><p>ill advised and poorly aimed.  Stopping the stipends will </p><p>not make the Nigerian bureaucracy move faster, but it will </p><p>frighten and destabilize the Official American Community in </p><p>Abuja.   It will present a small but (because of what is at </p><p>stake) very important risk to our office compound which </p><p>lacks any armed protection other than the NPF personnel. </p><p>Those present agreed that the first incident in which an </p><p>American employee or family member was involved and NPF </p><p>response was delayed or never came at all would provoke </p><p>mass requests for curtailment and SMA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The EAC therefore urgently requests the Department </p><p>to reconsider its plan to eliminate NPF stipends and to </p><p>extend the current purchase order system until the MOAs are </p><p>signed.  Post\'s vigorous efforts to bring the Nigerians to </p><p>the signing table will continue. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
