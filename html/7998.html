<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000790 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>REINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  COHABITATION CRISIS RETURNS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Sri Lanka\'s chronic cohabitation problems resurfaced on </p><p>Friday (5/9) when President Kumaratunga announced her </p><p>intention to remove the Development Lotteries Board from </p><p>the Ministry of Economic Reforms and put it under </p><p>presidential purview.  Media reaction was quick.  Some </p><p>Saturday (5/10) headlines were straightforward: </p><p>"Development Lottery Board taken over by the President," </p><p>DIVAINA (independent Sinhala daily) reported.  "President </p><p>takes over Development Lotteries Board" said the DAILY NEWS </p><p>(government-own English daily).  But by Saturday other </p><p>headlines had assumed that cohabitation, not lottery </p><p>boards, was the subject.  For example, the front page of </p><p>Saturday\'s DAILY MIRROR (independent English daily) said: </p><p>"President, PM clash head-on." </p><p> </p><p>2. On Sunday (5/11) the imbroglio spilled into nasty </p><p>headlines.  "Ready to fight if solution is not welcome" </p><p>said SUNDAY LANKADEEPA (independent Sinhala weekender), </p><p>quoting the Prime Minister.  "Serious violation of </p><p>cohabitation," said SUNDAY DIVAINA (independent Sinhala </p><p>weekender) quoting Milinda Moragoda, the Minister from whom </p><p>the lottery was being taken.  "President\'s action beginning </p><p>of a plot," SUNDAY THINKAKURAL (independent Tamil </p><p>weekender) suspected.  And "country plunged into crisis" </p><p>headlined the SUNDAY LEADER (independent English </p><p>weekender).  Clearly, another - and a badly timed - round </p><p>of cohabitation problems had arrived. </p><p> </p><p>3. Predictably, Sunday editorials pounced on the story. </p><p>Some blamed the President, others the Prime Minister.  All </p><p>were of a single mind, however:  not this, not now; </p><p>negotiations with the LTTE are more important that </p><p>cohabitation bickering.  Items: </p><p> </p><p>- the DAILY MIRROR (independent English daily) turned </p><p>metaphorical under the headline" Stop descent to further </p><p>degeneration":  "When a house is on fire, if the members of </p><p>the household begin a brawl inside, instead of making a </p><p>collective effort to put out the fire, what is immediately </p><p>called into question is the state of their sanity.  It is a </p><p>question of similar nature that has arisen in the public </p><p>mind over what the political leaders of this country are </p><p>doing today.  After we witnessed a flurry of diplomatic </p><p>activity engaged in by our foreign godfathers in a bid to </p><p>bring the recalcitrant LTTE back to the conference table, </p><p>we are now treated to a dramatic domestic battle over </p><p>ministry takeovers." </p><p> </p><p>- Under the headline "Negotiation and agreement is what we </p><p>need," DINAMINA (independent Sinhala daily) said: </p><p>"political parties may have political differences . but for </p><p>the sake of peace there should be co-habitation, not a </p><p>crisis." </p><p> </p><p>- DIVAINA (independent Sinhala daily) called it "a </p><p>political crisis ... totally uncalled for," noting that </p><p>when "the international community and its aid teams look at </p><p>the peace process, they see political comedy instead." </p><p> </p><p>- "Don\'t let unwanted crises topple the country," headlined </p><p>LANKADEEPA (independent Sinhala daily).  "This may effect </p><p>the aid conference," create "a conducive environment for </p><p>the Tigers," and damage the peace effort.  "Please </p><p>negotiate and solve problems without taking power hungry </p><p>approaches:  that is our earnest request to both parties." </p><p> </p><p>- Under the headline "Tit for tat?" the SUNDAY ISLAND </p><p>(independent English weekender) wrote:  "both sides have to </p><p>be roundly condemned about the games they are playing at a </p><p>time when the country needs more statesmanship and less </p><p>pettiness in the conduct of national business." </p><p> </p><p>- Said the SUNDAY OBSERVER (government-owned English </p><p>weekender):  "A return to the old practices of intense </p><p>rivalry over the resources and powers of the Sri Lankan </p><p>state will serve only to undermine the political impetus </p><p>towards an ending of the war.  Neither party can afford to </p><p>return, at this juncture, to the politics of contest of </p><p>over the `spoils\' of State.  The focus of the entire </p><p>nation, especially of the political leadership, must remain </p><p>fixed on the critical issue of the time. </p><p> </p><p>- The independent Tamil daily, Virakesari, called it a </p><p>"political crisis" that must be avoided.  "... all should </p><p>join hands in finding a lasting solution rather than any </p><p>infighting over petty issues....  This is the wish of the </p><p>people." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
