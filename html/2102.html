<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL/AAE AND AF/W </p><p>DEAHQS FOR OFE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NDLEA USES PRESS CONFERENCE TO TOUT </p><p>     INCREASED DRUG SEIZURES, NEW FOCUS ON SEA PORTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2710 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Lagos-based media representatives were invited to </p><p>a press conference at the NDLEA\'s Headquarters October </p><p>18.  RNLEO and DEA Attache attended, along with the UK </p><p>High Commission\'s Drug Liaison Officer.  Prior to </p><p>parading out the six traffickers arrested at the Lagos </p><p>airport in the last two weeks, NDLEA Chairman Lafiaji gave a </p><p>short address and answered the media\'s questions.  The </p><p>Chairman highlighted the recent Kano and Lago airports\' </p><p>drug seizures - totalling 12 kilograms of heroin, 3 </p><p>kilograms of cocaine, and 116 kilograms of ephedrine, </p><p>the essential chemical in methamphetamine production. </p><p>(Note:  The ephedrine seized represents one seizure made </p><p>in August from air cargo arriving in Lagos. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) The feature event, however, was the October 15 </p><p>seizured at the Lagos airport of 11.2 kilograms of </p><p>Southwest Asian heroin found in the checked baggage of a </p><p>Nigerian man returning from India via Addis Ababa on </p><p>Ethiopian Airlines.  Lafiaji also noted that the </p><p>previous night (October 17) NDLEA officers at the </p><p>Lagos airport arrested a 62-year woman attempting </p><p>to board the SAA/NA flight to New York/JFK, after </p><p>discovering through an x-ray that she was carrying </p><p>pellets of cocaine internally.  Lafiaji reported that </p><p>cocaine and heroin seized to date in 2001 totals 124 </p><p>kilograms (89 kilograms of cocaine and 35 kilograms of </p><p>heroin). Most of these seizures were the result of </p><p>intelligence developed by NDLEA investigators. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) Lafiaji also announced that the NDLEA now enjoys </p><p>unrestricted access to Nigeria\'s sea ports.  This resulted </p><p>from a Presidential decree signed shortly after the NDLEA </p><p>Lagos Zonal Unit\'s seizure of 60 kilograms of cocaine at the </p><p>Tin Can Island port on August 27.  With its newly expanded </p><p>writ, the NDLEA has now decided to create five new Zonal </p><p>Commands to handle the country\'s five main ports - Apapa, Tin </p><p>Can Island, </p><p>Calabar, Port Harcourt and Warri.  This will bring the </p><p>total number of Zonal Commands up to 25 and will allow a </p><p>greater concentration of NDLEA resources on port interdiction </p><p>efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) In a side meeting with DEA Attache and RNLEO, the </p><p>Chairman disclosed that on October 17 he had attended a </p><p>meeting on money laundering chaired by the Vice </p><p>President and including the Ministers of Justice and </p><p>Finance.  Lafiaji claimed that a decision had been made </p><p>to move ahead expeditiously to revise Nigeria\'s </p><p>inadequate money laundering law and to create a </p><p>Financial Crimes Commission (FCC) in order to address </p><p>international concern over Nigeria\'s performance in this </p><p>law enforcement area.  Lafiaji also proclaimed his </p><p>support for a centralized anti-money laundering agency </p><p>like the FCC, a noticeable change from his previous </p><p>statements on the subject (reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
