<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004249 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FAA WASH DC </p><p>HQ COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY BAGHDAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ETRD, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ON TO BAGHDAD: JORDAN-IRAQ CIVAIR AGREEMENT SIGNED </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY: Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) </p><p>Director Hanna Najjar signed a Letter of Agreement July 10 </p><p>regarding air traffic control and airway establishment </p><p>between Jordan and Iraq.  While communications and service </p><p>issues have yet to be ironed out, the LOA paves the way for </p><p>resumption of commercial air traffic between Amman and </p><p>Baghdad, perhaps as early as July 15, if RJ\'s application is </p><p>approved by CPA.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>OFF WE GO </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) CAA Director Najjar signed a Letter of Agreement </p><p>outlining air traffic control procedures and reestablishing </p><p>the airway between Jordan and Iraq.  He signed the LOA </p><p>following discussions between Jordanian CAA officials and US </p><p>CENTAF aviation authorities, acting on behalf of the </p><p>Coalition Provisional Authority of Iraq (CPA), regarding the </p><p>reopening of Iraqi air space to commercial traffic. </p><p>Jordanian assent to the LOA, one in a series of regional </p><p>agreements opening Iraqi air space to its neighbors, will </p><p>permit national carrier Royal Jordanian Airlines to resume </p><p>service from Amman to Baghdad, if its currently pending </p><p>application is approved by CPA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Although extremely satisfied with the terms of the </p><p>agreement itself, Najjar stressed that the CAA would not be </p><p>able to authorize resumption of service from Amman until land </p><p>line communications were established, a condition that CPA </p><p>Chief of Operations Air Traffic Control Major Joseph Fetsch </p><p>was confident would be realized by July 15.  In addition, </p><p>Najjar said he wanted to be sure that fueling, ground and </p><p>baggage handling, immigration, and customs services would be </p><p>available.  To that end, Najjar said that RJ would want to </p><p>send a team to Baghdad soon to assess the condition of the </p><p>airport and the availability of services.  CPA officials </p><p>agreed that such a visit could be arranged. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
