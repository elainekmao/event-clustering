<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001776 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 10 (3/25 0800 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) FBIS GMP20030324000163 (B) FBIS </p><p> </p><p>     GMP20030324000186 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Embassy continues on a normal schedule March 25, </p><p>with Consular services open.  Services at ancillary </p><p>facilities -- the Peace Corps Office and the American </p><p>Language Center -- remain suspended. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Lufthansa representatives reported they are resuming </p><p>flights to/from Amman three days a week, and they hope to be </p><p>back to five days a week by early April.  A total of three </p><p>European carriers have now restored service to Amman. Air </p><p>France and Alitalia had announced similar decisions on 3/22 </p><p>and 3/23 respectively. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  An amcit intending to enter Iraq requested a second, </p><p>emergency, passport.  She claimed to be an Israel-based </p><p>journalist with Cox Newspapers of Washington, D.C. and said </p><p>she intended to go to Iraq to cover the war and to visit her </p><p>Iraqi-citizen husband.  CONOFFS reminded the amcit of current </p><p>travel restrictions for Iraq, and informed her that Jordanian </p><p>authorities are not permitting journalists to enter Iraq from </p><p>Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) According to the official Petra News Service (ref a), </p><p>King Abdullah affirmed on 3/24 that no military planes are </p><p>using Jordanian airspace to strike Iraq: "This Jordanian </p><p>stand is very clear, and we will not allow any party to use </p><p>our airspace to strike Iraq."  In a meeting with the </p><p>President of the Jordanian Senate, the King also denied that </p><p>plans exist to convey military troops, originally intended to </p><p>move from Turkey into Iraq, through Jordan instead.  He also </p><p>announced Jordan\'s willingness to allow the Iraqi Embassy in </p><p>Amman to exchange the three diplomats ordered to depart the </p><p>Kingdom with three other diplomats. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The official Petra News Service reported a statement </p><p>by GOJ Information Minister Mohammed Adwan stating that four </p><p>Iraqis -- two who work for Iraqi airlines and two who work </p><p>for the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transportation Company -- </p><p>interrogated for security reasons on 3/23, were released on </p><p>3/24 (ref b). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) No new issues.  GOJ protection of the chancery </p><p>compound remains at a heightened state. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The Jordan-Iraq border remains open but the flow of </p><p>TCNs into Jordan has slowed to a trickle, with only a dozen </p><p>people entering Jordan overnight.  Still no sign of any Iraqi </p><p>refugees/asylum seekers.  UNHCR reports that two Amcits </p><p>entered Jordan overnight and were given authorization to move </p><p>directly to Amman. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) IOM has received a total of 482 TCNs at the Ruweished </p><p>transit camp since the onset of hostilities.  359 have now </p><p>departed Jordan and 123 currently remain in the transit camp. </p><p> The vast majority of TCNs are Sudanese (310 to date), </p><p>followed by Somalis (77) and Egyptians (31). The rest are a </p><p>mix of various African nationalities.  IOM reports that it </p><p>has been able to repatriate most TCNs within 24-36 hours of </p><p>arrival in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) 24 people remain in no-man\'s land on the border, held </p><p>up by documentation problems.  Most of them are Palestinians </p><p>married to Jordanian citizens.  UNHCR Rep Sten Bronee and the </p><p>Minister of Interior are at the border today and UNHCR </p><p>expects the situation will be resolved. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) UNHCR reported that the GOJ is seriously considering </p><p>halting the deportations of Iraqi nationals to Iraq until </p><p>hostilities have ended.  (Note:  Jordan currently is home to </p><p>an estimated 300,000 Iraqi citizens -- the vast majority of </p><p>whom are here without any legal status.  Over the last six </p><p>months, the GOJ has been deporting out-of-status Iraqis, </p><p>largely as a security measure.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  Embassy Public Affairs officers fielded several </p><p>questions overnight from local journalists asking about </p><p>rumors that either (a) VP Cheney was en route to the region </p><p>to try to stop his daughter from going to Baghdad to serve as </p><p>a human shield (sic); or (b) NEA DAS Liz Cheney was en route </p><p>to Baghdad with four unnamed Senators to negotiate a secret </p><p>cease-fire with Saddam Hussein.  PA denied these rumors. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
