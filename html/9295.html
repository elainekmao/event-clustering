O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, KIPR, SOCI, VM, IPROP </p><p>SUBJECT: HO CHI MINH CITY: COMPUTER RETAILING GETS MODERN - WITH </p><p>SAME OLD IPR PROBLEMS </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  On a visit to Ho Chi Minh City\'s newest Computer and </p><p>IT superstore, ConGen EconOff, accompanied by a Vietnamese </p><p>assistant, saw a local attempt at modern American-style computer </p><p>retailing, but with the same old Vietnamese IPR problems.  The </p><p>computers assembled by the company and sold under the company\'s </p><p>trademark (which it is trying to promote and protect) use </p><p>unlicensed software.  Some licensed software -- along with the </p><p>usual assortment of pirated software -- is being offered for sale, </p><p>however.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  EconOff and Vietnamese assistant visited the recently opened </p><p>Ho Chi Minh City branch of Nguyen Hoang Informatics on July 8. </p><p>The company, which was founded in 1999 and is Vietnamese-owned and </p><p>operated, also has branches in Danang, Vung Tau, Dong Nai and Buon </p><p>Ma Thuot.  The store, whose opening was covered by the local </p><p>press, bills itself as a computer superstore and is homegrown </p><p>effort at modern computer retailing.  Unlike many of the mom and </p><p>pop stores that crowd electronics districts in Ho Chi Minh City, </p><p>Nguyen Hoang has wide aisles, a full line of products on display, </p><p>catalogues prominently displaying prices and specs, and full </p><p>warranty service.  Most notably, the store even has a Brand </p><p>Manager who is trying to build the company trademark. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Nguyen Hoang Informatics sells pre-assembled computer units </p><p>under the Nguyen Hoang trademark ranging in price from about $335- </p><p>600.  The store also sells units from Acer, Hewlett-Packard, and </p><p>SingPC and laptops from Acer, Compaq, Toshiba, IBM, NEC and </p><p>MacIntosh.  Its catalog advertises other hardware accessories such </p><p>as printers, scanners, speakers, and fax machines.  The shop also </p><p>carries a full range of computer peripherals.  It is a licensed </p><p>distributor for Intel.  Both the store-branded products and the </p><p>name-brand machines carry warranties. </p><p> </p><p>4.  If the shop is an example of modern retailing, it is </p><p>definitely modernization Vietnamese style.  This was revealed </p><p>immediately when EconOff asked the company\'s brand manager, who </p><p>was working the floor that morning, what software came loaded onto </p><p>the pre-assembled units for sale.  His reponse: "Whatever you </p><p>want, we\'ll load it.  No problem. You want Windows 2000?  Windows </p><p>ME?  We\'ve got it, I\'ve got a disk in the back, I\'ll set it up for </p><p>you."  When asked whether those copies were licensed, he became </p><p>very quiet, looked down at the floor, looked back up and said </p><p>"Sure."  Not surprisingly, however, the Microsoft country director </p><p>later advised that while he was familiar with the store, to his </p><p>knowledge none of the software loaded onto Nguyen Hoang\'s own </p><p>brand computers is licensed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  EconOff observed several glass cases full of software in the </p><p>store.  Based on price and packaging, some of the software </p><p>appeared to be licensed.  The top of the line by far was a full- </p><p>case display of AutoCad and AutoDesk promotional material, with </p><p>each product priced at US $3300.  When asked why these products </p><p>were so expensive, a store clerk smiled and replied "Because they </p><p>are licensed.  We have a license to sell this software."  The </p><p>clerk noted that she had not received any orders for it yet, and </p><p>said that if they ever did receive an order they would request a </p><p>copy from their distributor and it would take some time for the </p><p>product to arrive.  Elsewhere in the display case, however, </p><p>Vietnamese licensed software, most of which was for English </p><p>language study, was selling for between VND 50,000-120,000 </p><p>(approximately US $3.20-7.74). </p><p> </p><p>6.  The real bargains, however, were in another glass cabinet, </p><p>where several pirated games, music CDs and software programs were </p><p>displayed in cellophane packets.  Among them were Microsoft 2000 </p><p>operating system, Microsoft Millenium Edition operating system, </p><p>and Microsoft Professional XP Suite -- all selling for VND 7500 </p><p>(approximately fifty US cents). </p><p> </p><p>7.  Comment:  It may be a positive sign that Ho Chi Minh City\'s </p><p>first computer superstore has recognized the importance of </p><p>developing and protecting trademarks -- specifically its own -- </p><p>and offers at least some licensed software for sale.  But what is </p><p>worrisome is that "modern" computer retailing in HCMC still </p><p>includes nurturing a generation of consumers who believe </p><p>developing countries have a right to cheap prices.  In a country </p><p>where consumers are generally unwilling to pay for licensed </p><p>copies, it is not surprising that what Nguyen Hoang Informatics </p><p>has loaded onto its computers and most of what it has in stock is </p><p>pirated.  This is standard Vietnamese observance of software IPR. </p><p>In a separate conversation, Microsoft\'s company director noted </p><p>that at HCMC\'s 8th "ComputerWorld Expo", virtually all of the </p><p>computers on display were running on unlicensed software.  Modern </p><p>retailing or not, IPR protection has a long way to go in the IT </p><p>industry here.  End Comment. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
