<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000211 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: ICAO SECURITY MINISTERIAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 3397 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  The GON supports USG positions within ICAO for </p><p>the February Security Ministerial.  Minister of Aviation </p><p>plans to lead the GON delegation in Montreal.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Econoff presented Reftel demarche January 9 to Chief I.E. </p><p>Awodu, Technical Assistant to the Minister of Aviation. </p><p>Awodu could not immediately comment on Nigeria\'s position </p><p>vis-a-vis the February ICAO Security Ministerial, but </p><p>provided a written response on January 18.  The Ministry of </p><p>Aviation and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority noted the </p><p>achievements of the AVSEC Panel and agreed that Nigeria and </p><p>other ICAO member-states should implement the newly revised </p><p>standards as contained in Amendment 10 to Annex 17.  The NCAA </p><p>"already ensures that checks are carried out at both domestic </p><p>and international airports in the country" to prevent </p><p>unlawful interference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. One of the NCAA\'s highest priorities is to strengthen </p><p>cockpit security.  Additional items have been prohibited from </p><p>aircraft cabins, cockpit doors are to be reinforced and must </p><p>be locked at all times, and access to the flight deck is now </p><p>limited to operational crew.  NCAA believes that an ICAO </p><p>mandated standard to protect the cockpit from forcible entry </p><p>is a must. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. NCAA fully supports ICAO\'s Security Audit Program "to </p><p>ensure a uniform level of security worldwide."  NCAA endorses </p><p>the methodologies already in use for the ICAO Universal </p><p>Safety Oversight Program, which include mandatory and </p><p>universal participation and the sharing of non-sensitive </p><p>information between member-states.  NCAA agrees that program </p><p>administration should be carried out by the AVSEC Mechanism </p><p>with a separate section dedicated to the Audit Program.  NCAA </p><p>also agrees that to ensure universality of the program at </p><p>this time, it may not be regionalized.  NCAA supports the </p><p>compliance mechanism currently contained in the Universal </p><p>Safety Audit Program.  Although Nigeria supports voluntary </p><p>and unrestricted funding of the Audit Program, the GON does </p><p>not have resources to commit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. If desired, Post will fax the Department full text of the </p><p>GON reply upon receipt of a conact name and fax number. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Minister of Aviation (Dr.) Kema Chikwe plans to lead the </p><p>GON delegation to the February Security Ministerial in </p><p>Montreal. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
