<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000208 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/16/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KE, DJ, ER, ET, SO, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA EAST AFRICA DIRECTOR AND NSC AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p>EXCHANGE VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL M C TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.    (C) SUMMARY:  MFA EAST AFRICA DIRECTOR PAOLA IMPERIALE </p><p>AND NSC AFRICA DIRECTOR MATTHEW MCLEAN EXCHANGED VIEWS ON A </p><p>BROAD RANGE OF EAST AFRICA ISSUES.  THE TWO DISCUSSED SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN KENYA, POLICY REGARDING SOMALILAND, </p><p>THE ROLES OF DJIBOUTI AND ERITREA IN THE GWOT, AND THE </p><p>REGIONAL FOOD CRISIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00208  170922Z </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>KENYA:  SUPPORTING THE NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) AT THE REQUEST OF MCLEAN, IMPERIALE AND HE MET </p><p>SATURDAY, JANUARY 11 FOR AN INFORMAL DISCUSSION OF EAST </p><p>AFRICA POLICY.  ON KENYA, IMPERIALE MENTIONED THAT THE </p><p>ITALIAN PARLIAMENT HAS A PROJECT TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ADVICE </p><p>TO THE KENYAN PARLIAMENT.  MCLEAN AGREED THAT TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE, GOOD GOK POLICY, AND PROGRESS AGAINST CORRUPTION </p><p>SHOULD PRECEDE A FULL AID PACKAGE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>SOMALILAND:  "AUTONOMY WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) DISCUSSING HOW TO HELP SOMALILAND ABSENT PROGRESS </p><p>IN THE SOUTH, IMPERIALE EXPLAINED THE GOI VIEW THAT </p><p>OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZING SOMALILAND AUTONOMY "WOULD BE VERY </p><p>DANGEROUS."  MOST IMPORTANTLY, SOMALILAND HAD "VOTED AWAY" </p><p>ITS RIGHT TO SOVEREIGNTY, AND UNDOING THE REFERENDUM WITHOUT </p><p>THE AGREEMENT OF A RECOGNIZED CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WOULD SET A </p><p>DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.  FORMAL RECOGNITION WOULD CREATE </p><p>DIFFICULTIES IN THE SUDANESE PEACE PROCESS, BECAUSE ARAB </p><p>STATES WOULD FEAR THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD </p><p>THEREFORE APPROVE SOUTHERN SUDAN\'S SECESSION OR AUTONOMY. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, SOMALIA HAD HUGE DEBTS.  WHO WOULD BE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM IN THE EVENT OF FINANCIAL AUTONOMY?  IN </p><p>ANY CASE, SOMALILAND WAS NOT AS DEMOCRATIC AS IT MIGHT AT </p><p>FIRST APPEAR.  NEVERTHELESS, IMPERIALE CONCLUDED, THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S FAILURE TO PUSH SOMALILAND TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00208  170922Z </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE PEACE PROCESS ALREADY CONSTITUTED "DE </p><p>FACTO RECOGNITION." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>DJIBOUTI AND ERITREA:  MINOR PARTNERS IN THE GWOT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) IMPERIALE SAID DJIBOUTI\'S PRESIDENT WANTED TO BE </p><p>INVITED TO ROME BUT IMPLIED IT WAS A LOW PRIORITY FOR THE </p><p>GOI.  MCLEAN SUGGESTED THE PRESIDENT STOP IN ROME ON THE WAY </p><p>TO HIS UPCOMING VISIT TO WASHINGTON.  IMPERIALE ASKED WHETHER </p><p>THE USG WAS PLANNING TO INCREASE ITS SECURITY PRESENCE IN </p><p>DJIBOUTI.  MCLEAN SAID THAT DJIBOUTI DID NOT HAVE THE </p><p>CAPACITY TO ABSORB A MUCH GREATER PRESENCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C) IMPERIALE NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH ONLY ERITREA </p><p>IMPRISONED JOURNALISTS, MAKING IT LOOK MORE OPPRESSIVE THAN </p><p>ETHIOPIA, THERE WAS NO MORE PRESS FREEDOM IN ETHIOPIA BECAUSE </p><p>THE PRESS THERE WAS ENTIRELY GOVERNMENT OWNED.  MCLEAN SAID </p><p>THAT BECAUSE OF THE IMPRISONED FSNS, THE USG WANTED TO GO </p><p>SLOWLY ON BUILDING TIES TO ASMARA BUT ALSO HAD TO CONSIDER </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY THAT ERITREAN ASSETS WOULD BE OF VALUE IN THE </p><p>GWOT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>AFRICA FOOD CRISIS:  GOI FOCUSES ON EAST AFRICA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) IMPERIALE SAID THAT THE GOI WAS TRYING TO RAISE THE </p><p>PROFILE OF THE EAST AFRICAN FOOD CRISIS TO THE LEVEL OF </p><p>ATTENTION THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN FOOD CRISIS HAD RECEIVED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00208  170922Z </p><p>ETHIOPIA\'S ONE-PARTY STATE AND GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF LAND </p><p>DISCOURAGED PRIVATE INVESTMENT, AND MCLEAN AND SHE AGREED ON </p><p>THE NEED FOR A LONG-TERM SOLUTION:  AGRICULTURE REFORM IN </p><p>ETHIOPIA.  IMPERIALE SAID THAT WHEN MELES CAME TO ROME IN </p><p>LATE FEBRUARY OR MARCH, THE GOI WOULD TRY TO GET HIM TO "GIVE </p><p>UP HIS COMMUNIST IDEAS." </p><p> </p><p>7.   (C) WITH REGARD TO SECURITY ISSUES, IMPERIALE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION DID NOT SHARE INTELLIGENCE </p><p>BECAUSE OF RACIAL SUSPICIONS.  ("ETHIOPIANS CONSIDER </p><p>THEMSELVES HISTORICALLY SUPERIOR," SHE SAID.)  FINALLY, THE </p><p>ETHIOPIANS "ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN THE ELDORET PEACE PROCESS FOR THE SECURITY OF THE REGION." </p><p> </p><p>8.   (U) NSC DIRECTOR MCLEAN DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>CLEAR THIS CABLE. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00208 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
