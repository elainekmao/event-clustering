<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 003359 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR IO/UNP AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KSCA, PREL, TBIO, VT, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMAN CLONING RESOLUTION:  HOLY SEE PRESSING THE </p><p>CASE FOR COSTA RICAN RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 186073 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  PER REFTEL, DCM APPROACHED HOLY SEE DEPUTY </p><p>    FOREIGN MINISTER PAROLIN AND PRESIDENT OF THE PONTIFICAL </p><p>COUNCIL FOR HEALTH ARCHBISHOP JAVIER LOZANO BARRAGAN TO URGE </p><p>CONTINUED VATICAN ACTION ON BEHALF OF A UN RESOLUTION BANNING </p><p>ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING.  DCM REVIEWED U.S. OBJECTIONS TO </p><p>THE REVISED FRENCH-GERMAN PROPOSAL, AND PROVIDED BOTH </p><p>OFFICIALS WITH THE REFTEL LIST OF KEY COUNTRIES FOR HOLY SEE </p><p>ENGAGEMENT.  BOTH PAROLIN AND LOZANO BARRAGAN EXPRESSED THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S FULL SUPPORT FOR THE COSTA RICAN RESOLUTION.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE IS PREPARING A DOCUMENT ON HUMAN CLONING TO BE </p><p>SHARED WITH ALL NUNCIOS AND WITH BISHOPS IN KEY COUNTRIES TO </p><p>FACILITATE LOCAL ENGAGEMENT ON THE ISSUE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DCM APPROACHED HOLY SEE DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER PIETRO </p><p>PAROLIN JULY 8 TO CONVEY REFTEL DEMARCHE SEEKING SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE COSTA RICAN DRAFT RESOLUTION WHICH CALLS FOR ADOPTION OF </p><p>A CONVENTION THAT WOULD BAN ALL HUMAN CLONING.  PAROLIN </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THE VATICAN REMAINS FIRMLY OPPOSED TO ANY TYPE </p><p>OF EMBRYONIC CLONING AND WILL FULLY SUPPORT THE COSTA RICA </p><p>RESOLUTION.  SIGNIFICANTLY, PAROLIN AVOIDED PREVIOUS VATICAN </p><p>CAVEATS ABOUT ACCEPTING A BAN ON REPRODUCTIVE CLONING IF A </p><p>FULL BAN COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED AND EXPRESSED STRONG </p><p>OPPOSITION TO ANY COMPROMISE THAT WOULD ACCEPT </p><p>&EXPERIMENTAL8 OR &THERAPEUTIC8 CLONING.  THE VATICAN NOW </p><p>APPEARS FULLY COMMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES\' STRATEGY </p><p>TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON ALL TYPES OF EMBRYONIC </p><p>CLONING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  REFLECTING THIS COMMITMENT, PAROLIN TOLD DCM THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE WAS IN THE FINAL STAGES OF PREPARING A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>DOCUMENT OUTLINING THE VATICAN\'S POSITION ON CLONING.  THE </p><p>PAPER, WHICH HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY HOLY SEE UN PERMREP </p><p>    MIGLIORE, WILL BE SHARED WIDELY WITHIN THE UN, INCLUDING ALL </p><p>UN MISSIONS, AND WILL ALSO BE SENT TO NUNCIOS AND BISHOPS IN </p><p>KEY TARGET COUNTRIES.  DCM PROVIDED PAROLIN WITH THE REFTEL </p><p>LIST OF COUNTRIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL ENGAGEMENT, </p><p>AND HE AGREED TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW DOCUMENT WAS SENT TO ALL </p><p>OF THE KEY COUNTRIES AS WELL AS OTHERS.  PAROLIN STRESSED </p><p>THAT EACH OF THE PAPER\'S POINTS WILL BE PRUDENTIAL AND ROOTED </p><p>IN SCIENCE.  FURTHERMORE, THE VATICAN WILL PRESENT ADULT STEM </p><p>CELL RESEARCH AS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE TO EMBRYONIC CLONING. </p><p>THE PAPER WAS TO BE COMPLETED AND DISTRIBUTED BY THE END OF </p><p>JULY.  IN FACT, PAROLIN LEFT THE MEETING TO ATTEND A MEETING </p><p>TO FINALIZE SOME DRAFTING ELEMENTS FOR THE PAPER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  DCM SUBSEQUENTLY MET WITH ARCHBISHOP LOZANO BARRAGAN JULY </p><p>11.  BARRAGAN RECALLED HIS MEETING WITH HHS SECRETARY TOMMY </p><p>THOMPSON AND OFFERED HIS FULL SUPPORT FOR THE COSTA RICAN </p><p>RESOLUTION.  HE PLEDGED THAT THE HOLY SEE &WILL DO OUR </p><p>BEST8 TO INFLUENCE TARGET COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN </p><p>TO BAN ALL FORMS OF CLONING.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE CAUTIONED </p><p>THAT IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, THE GOVERNMENTS\' </p><p>COMPLEX RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE SOMETIMES LIMITS HOW HARD </p><p>THE NUNCIOS AND BISHOPS CAN PUSH HOST GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA03359 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
