<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 NDJAMENA 00335 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PTER, CD, NI, NG, CM, LY </p><p>SUBJ: CHAD\'S RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) NDJAMENA 302, (B) LAGOS 991, (C) NIAMEY 489 </p><p>(ALL NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  SENIOR GOC OFFICIALS HAVE STRESSED TO ME </p><p>THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. AND OTHERS IN OUR EFFORTS TO </p><p>COUNTER LIBYAN TERRORISM, AND THEY HAVE PROVIDED </p><p>ASSURANCES THAT THEY WILL RESIST LIBYAN EFFORTS TO </p><p>NEUTRALIZE WESTERN INFLUENCE IN THIS REGARD.  FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER AHMAT BRIEFED ME ON THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>RECENT VISITS TO NIGER, NIGERIA, CAMEROON AND LIBYA. </p><p>HE SAID THAT THE GOC WILL SOON SEND DELEGATIONS TO </p><p>KHARTOUM AND BANGUI AS WELL.  WHILE GENERALLY PLEASED </p><p>WITH THE SUPPORT OF CHAD\'S NEIGHBORS, THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER HAD A REALISTIC SENSE OF WHAT IS AND WHAT IS </p><p>NOT POSSIBLE.  IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT, THE GOC SEEMS </p><p>MORE CONCERNED THAN USUAL TO MAINTAIN THE SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE USG, AND IT RECOGNIZES THAT WILL REQUIRE </p><p>CONSIDERABLE CARE IN DEALING WITH LIBYA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>FOLLOW-UP TO PAN AM/UTA DEMARCHE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>- </p><p>3.  FOLLOWING LAST FRIDAY\'S PAN AM 103/UTA 772 DEMARCHE </p><p>(REF A), PRESIDENT DEBY SUMMONED ME ON SATURDAY.  HE </p><p>ASSURED ME THAT CHAD SUPPORTED OUR POSITION REGARDING </p><p>LIBYAN TERRORISM.  HE NOTED CHAD\'S OWN LOSSES ON THE </p><p>UTA 772 FLIGHT AS WELL AS ITS OTHER CONCERNS REGARDING </p><p>LIBYA.  HE ALSO SAID THAT SENIOR LIBYAN OFFICIALS HAD </p><p>PHONED HIM SEEKING HIS SUPPORT.  HE CLAIMED TO HAVE </p><p>REJECTED THEIR ENTREATIES.   HE SAID HE GAVE PRECISE </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS TO PRIME MINISTER ALINGUE NOT TO FALL INTO </p><p>ANY LIBYAN TRAPS REGARDING THE PAN AM/UTA ISSUE. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  ON MONDAY, JANUARY 20 FOREIGN MINISTER MAHAMAT </p><p>SALEH AHMAT, WHO ACCOMPANIED ALINGUE ON HIS RECENT </p><p>TRIPS TO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, REITERATED THE POINTS </p><p>MADE BY DEBY.  HE SHOWED ME THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE SIGNED </p><p>IN TRIPOLI THE DAY BEFORE.  HE DREW MY ATTENTION TO THE </p><p>UNEQUIVOCAL CONDEMNATION OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN </p><p>ALL ITS FORMS, NOTING THE INNOCENT LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN </p><p>LOST.  THE TEXT APPEARED TO BE STRENGTHENED BY THE </p><p>CHADIANS, AND IT NOTED THAT EACH SIDE EXPLAINED ITS </p><p>RESPECTIVE POSITION.   THE LIBYANS DID MANAGE TO GET </p><p>THE CHADIANS TO AGREE TO LANGUAGE NOTING THE THREATS </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION WEIGHING ON THE LIBYAN PEOPLE.  CHAD </p><p>MADE SUPPORTIVE STATEMENTS TO THE LIBYAN PEOPLE WHO </p><p>FACED THREATS OF DESTABILIZATION TO THE SUB-REGION. </p><p>- </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ALINGUE\'S MEETINGS </p><p>------------------ </p><p>- </p><p>5.  ON ALINGUE\'S MEETINGS IN NEIGHBORING CAPITALS, </p><p>AHMAT SAID THAT AT EACH STOP, INCLUDING TRIPOLI, THE </p><p>RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS OFFERED TO SUPPORT THE GOC.  IN </p><p>NIGER HE SAID THE GON WAS UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORTIVE </p><p>BUT EXTREMELY LIMITED IN TERMS OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY </p><p>COULD DO GIVEN DIFFICULT DOMESTIC PRIORITIES AND </p><p>LIMITED FUNDS.  HE SAID THAT THE BULK OF THE REFUGEES </p><p>WOULD BE MOVED TO DIFFA FROM N\'GUIGMI AND SOME OF THE </p><p>LEADERS WOULD BE PLACED IN DOSSO.  HE SAID THE </p><p>NIGERIANS AGREED TO OPEN THE BORDER WHICH IS IMPORTANT </p><p>TO PEOPLE WHO TRADE ACROSS THE FRONTIER.   AHMAT NOTED </p><p>THAT THE REBELS DID NOT OBSERVE THE CLOSED BORDER IN </p><p>ANY CASE, SO THERE WAS NOTHING GAINED BY KEEPING IT </p><p>CLOSED.  HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT ABUJA WOULD ACT BUT </p><p>SKEPTICAL THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD OVERCOME </p><p>THE EFFECT OF SUPPORT THE REBELS ARE ABLE TO GARNER IN </p><p>BORNU.  AHMAT SEEMED GENERALLY SATISFIED WITH THE </p><p>MEASURES BEING TAKEN BY THE CAMEROONIANS.  WHEN I ASKED </p><p>WHETHER HE FELT THAT THE GOC HAD LIBYAN SUPPORT, HE </p><p>REPLIED, QUOTE WELL, THAT IS WHAT THEY SAY.  UNQUOTE. </p><p>- </p><p>6.  AHMAT SAID THAT PRIME MINISTER ALINGUE INTENDS TO </p><p>LEAD DELEGATIONS SOON TO CAR AND SUDAN, AND HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE GOC IS BEING ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH THE </p><p>SENEGALESE IN DAKAR.  HE SAID THAT THE MEETINGS IN </p><p>NIGER, NIGERIA AND CAMEROON ENTAILED FAIRLY SPECIFIC </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WHILE THOSE IN OTHER CAPITALS WERE MORE IN </p><p>THE NATURE OF BRIEFINGS TO SENSITIZE CHAD\'S NEIGHBORS </p><p>TO THE IMPORTANCE N\'DJAMENA ATTACHES TO THE REBEL </p><p>THREAT.  TALKS IN DAKAR WOULD BE AIMED AT PRESSING THE </p><p>GOS TO EXERT GREATER CONTROL OVER HABRE.  AHMAT CLAIMED </p><p>THAT REBEL LEADER GOUKOUNI GUET HAS RETURNED TO </p><p>SENEGAL, PRESUMABLY TO PLAN NEXT MOVES WITH HABRE. </p><p>- </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>CHADIAN PERCEPTION OF THE U.S. ROLE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>- </p><p>7.  THE CHADIANS SEEM TO HAVE LINKED SEVERAL RECENT </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS.  THE REBEL ATTACKS AND THE WAVE OF </p><p>ARRESTS THAT FOLLOWED, HAVE SHAKEN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>THE DEBY REGIME, AND IN THIS CONTEXT OUR VOLUNTARY </p><p>DEPARTURE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS SEEN AS A FURTHER BLOW.  IN </p><p>THE MEANTIME, OUR DEMARCHES (AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE </p><p>FRENCH) BOTH ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND LIBYA APPEAR TO </p><p>HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON DEBY.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT MANY IF </p><p>NOT ALL OF THOSE ARRESTED WILL SOON BE TRIED OR </p><p>RELEASED AND THAT DEBY\'S PRO-LIBYAN CHIEF OF STAFF </p><p>HASSAN FADOUL KITIR IS TO BE FIRED.  THE STATEMENTS BY </p><p>DEBY AND AHMAT WERE MEANT TO ASSURE US THAT THE GOC, IN </p><p>PART TO PRESERVE U.S. SUPPORT, IS CONDUCTING ITS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH LIBYA WITH GREAT CARE.  FROM DEBY\'S </p><p>PERSPECTIVE, IN THE AFTERMATH OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS </p><p>MONTH, IT IS CRUCIAL TO HAVE U.S. SUPPORT BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE LEGITIMACY IT BESTOWS ON HIM. </p><p>- </p><p>8.  AT THIS POINT, WE WANT TO WAIT TO SEE IF INDEED THE </p><p>ACTIONS NOTED IN PARA 8 WILL BE TAKEN, AND IF THEY ARE </p><p>WHAT REACTIONS WILL FOLLOW.  WE ANTICIPATE MAKING </p><p>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THAT TIME. </p><p> </p><p>BOGOSIAN </p><p></p></div>
