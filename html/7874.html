<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF "SIAM-BURMA DEATH RAILWAY" </p><p>COMMEMORATED </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  COM, DATT, and others participated in a </p><p>May 1 Australia-organized ceremony commemorating the 60th </p><p>anniversary of the infamous Siam-Burma Death Railway.  133 </p><p>Americas were among the estimated 12,000 Allied POWs who </p><p>perishing while slaving on the railway\'s construction.  This </p><p>was the first time the GOB has permitted the C-12 out of </p><p>Bangkok to fly from Rangoon to Moulmein (Mawlamyine).  The </p><p>usual high-profile presence of Military Intelligence minders </p><p>was largely absent during this trip and the GOB did not </p><p>attempt to place a "safety officer" on board the C-12. </p><p>Perhaps the GOB\'s lighter touch on this trip was an </p><p>outgrowth of the successful, confidence-building WWII </p><p>remains recovery mission concluded last month.   END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Four surviving Australian POWs were among the 60 or </p><p>so mostly Australian civilians who traveled to Thanbyuzarat, </p><p>the Burma terminus of the railway constructed with forced </p><p>POW and "native" labor in WWII.  The COM joined the </p><p>Australian and British ambassadors for a short service at </p><p>the cemetery, at which former POW Dr. Rowley Richards was </p><p>the keynote speaker.  The surviving POWs were the event\'s </p><p>center of focus and willingly shared their memories and </p><p>experiences.  Dr. Richards recounted that, while en route to </p><p>a POW camp in Japan after the completion of the railway, his </p><p>ship was torpedoed by a U.S. submarine.  He was fished out </p><p>of the ocean by a lifeboat and arrived in Japan just prior </p><p>to the nuclear attacks.  As a prison doctor he undoubtedly </p><p>saved many American lives, commenting, "On my rounds I used </p><p>to linger longer than I should have with the Americans, as I </p><p>was fascinated by the accents of your chaps from the Bronx." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) This was the first time the GOB has permitted the </p><p>C-12 out of Bangkok to fly from Rangoon to Moulmein </p><p>(Mawlamyine).  Flying on the C-12 saved the Embassy group a </p><p>15-hour round-trip drive over dangerous roads.  Situated 100 </p><p>miles and a 35-minute flight southeast of Rangoon, Moulmein </p><p>is Burma\'s fourth largest city and a former capital of </p><p>British Lower Burma.  Airport formalities were non-existent </p><p>in Moulmein and apart from a slightly delayed takeoff </p><p>(caused by a dog napping on the tarmac), the flights were </p><p>without incident.  The blacktop road running 40 miles south </p><p>from Moulmein to Thanbyuzarat winds through miles of rubber </p><p>plantations; although in past years the area has been </p><p>plagued by insurgency, the road featured only one security </p><p>checkpoint.  Embassy Rangoon extends its thanks to Embassy </p><p>Bangkok, particularly to the DAO and C-12 crew, for the </p><p>generous use of the aircraft. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  We noted that the normal high-profile </p><p>presence of Military Intelligence minders was largely absent </p><p>during this trip.  Further, the GOB did not attempt to place </p><p>a "safety officer" on board the C-12 this time.  This was </p><p>also the first year the GOB permitted the Australian embassy </p><p>to host a formal ceremony at Thanbyuzarat.  Perhaps the </p><p>GOB\'s lighter touch on this trip was an outgrowth of the </p><p>successful, confidence-building WWII remains recovery </p><p>mission concluded last month.  End Comment.
