<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 002109 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, IR, CA, Iran </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA RECALLS AMBASSADOR FROM IRAN OVER </p><p>JOURNALIST\'S DEATH </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 1875 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Foreign Minister Graham announced on July 23 that </p><p>Canada is recalling its Ambassador to Iran after Iran </p><p>proceeded to bury photojournalist Zahra Kazemi rather than </p><p>return her body to Canada.  Kazemi\'s son in Montreal had </p><p>called for the body to be returned to Canada, and Graham said </p><p>that Kazemi\'s mother requested this as well at the Canadian </p><p>Embassy in Tehran, but that Iranian authorities forced her to </p><p>proceed with a burial in Iran.  Graham described this case as </p><p>part of a bigger struggle between Iran\'s </p><p>police/judicial/religious authorities on the one hand and the </p><p>Khatami Government on the other. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Kazemi, who was born in Iran but has Canadian </p><p>citizenship and is based in Montreal, was detained on June 23 </p><p>after taking (forbidden) photographs of a prison north of </p><p>Tehran.  According to a report issued by the Iranian </p><p>Government, Kazemi went through 77 hours of interrogation by </p><p>police, prosecutors and intelligence officials before being </p><p>hospitalized on June 27.  She died on July 10 from a "blow to </p><p>the head by a hard object," a blow delivered on June 25 or </p><p>26.  Iranian President Khatami commissioned the inquiry which </p><p>produced this report, and which also recommended an </p><p>independent judge be appointed to identify those responsible. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Chrystiane Roy, Foreign Affairs\' Desk Officer for </p><p>Iran, told us that Canada is now reviewing all aspects of its </p><p>relations with Iran, which the GoC had previously described </p><p>as "controlled engagement."  The Canadian Embassy will remain </p><p>open and there will be no break in relations, but Roy </p><p>expected a decrease in Ministerial contacts, official visits, </p><p>and cooperation with Iran in international fora, as well as </p><p>possible action in the UN Human Rights Commission.  She said </p><p>that the GoC would determine triggers for the return of its </p><p>Ambassador to Tehran, probably including action against those </p><p>responsible for Kazemi\'s death. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Roy said that the Kazemi case has become a lightening </p><p>rod in the power struggle now going on in Iran.  She viewed </p><p>the Khatami Government\'s extraordinary response - holding an </p><p>inquiry, admitting the death was caused by a blow to the head </p><p>while in custody, and posting the report on the Government\'s </p><p>website - as an effort to deal a blow to anti-reform forces. </p><p>She added that Iranian Government officials have been helpful </p><p>to the Canadian Embassy in this case, but that they do not </p><p>recognize dual citizenship and so are officially treating </p><p>this as an internal matter.  Kazemi never renounced her </p><p>Iranian citizenship, and had travelled to Iran on her Iranian </p><p>passport. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Roy was pleased that Prosecutor General for Tehran </p><p>Mortazavi (aka "the butcher of journalists"), who was present </p><p>at Kazemi\'s interrogation and had initially been named to </p><p>pursue the inquiry, had withdrawn in favor of a military </p><p>prosecutor.  But she still expected Iran\'s judiciary, </p><p>controlled by the clerics, to thwart the process. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: By taking the rare step of recalling its </p><p>Ambassador, Canada has underscored the seriousness of the </p><p>Kazemi case.  Canada has long maintained that its "controlled </p><p>engagement" with Iran allows it to make a positive impact in </p><p>Tehran (similar to its Cuba policy), but the circumstances of </p><p>the death of this Canadian citizen could not be ignored.  Her </p><p>burial in Tehran, against her family\'s wishes and limiting </p><p>further investigation, was the last straw.  The fact that </p><p>Canada is extremely concerned about Iran\'s nuclear weapons </p><p>program (reftel) will also be factored into its reassessment </p><p>of the relationship. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
