<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIRUT 003570 </p><p> </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ILMG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 10/01/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, KISL, MEPP, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR\'S CALLS ON PARLIAMENTARY LEADERSHIP </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR SATTERFIELD.  REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  DURING THE AMBASSADOR\'S INTRODUCTORY CALLS </p><p>AT THE PARLIAMENT, SPEAKER NABIH BERRI AND HIS DEPUTY ELIE </p><p>FERZLI INDICATED THAT LAF COMMANDER GENERAL EMILE LAHUD IS </p><p>THE MOST OBVIOUS CHOICE TO BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF </p><p>LEBANON.  THEY HEDGED THEIR BETS BY NOTING THAT SEVERAL </p><p>OTHER CANDIDATES (SUCH AS NASSIB LAHUD AND JEAN OBEID) ALSO </p><p>HAD A CHANCE TO BECOME PRESIDENT.  BOTH EXPRESSED THE NEED </p><p>TO ELECT A STRONG PRESIDENT TO COUNTERBALANCE THE POWER OF </p><p>PRIME MINISTER RAFIQ AL-HARIRI.  THEY ALSO ASSERTED THAT THE </p><p>ELECTION OF A MILITARY LEADER WOULD NOT ENDANGER "DEMOCRACY" </p><p>IN LEBANON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AMBASSADOR PAID A COURTESY CALL ON SPEAKER BERRI ON </p><p>24 SEPTEMBER.  AFTER EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT POLITICAL </p><p>TURMOIL IN WASHINGTON WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS "A PLOT TO </p><p>UNDERMINE THE PRESIDENT," BERRI TURNED TO THE SITUATION IN </p><p>SOUTHERN LEBANON AND DOMESTIC LEBANESE POLITICS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>SITUATION IN THE SOUTH: APPRECIATION FOR ILMG </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) BERRI EXPRESSED GREAT APPRECIATION FOR THE ROLE OF </p><p>THE ISRAEL-LEBANON MONITORING GROUP (ILMG) IN CALMING DOWN </p><p>THE SITUATION IN THE SOUTH.  HE SAID THAT THE LOCAL </p><p>POPULATION\'S ATTACHMENT TO ILMG HAS BECOME SIMILAR TO THAT </p><p>TOWARDS UNIFIL.  "IF WE DID NOT HAVE THE ILMG, WE DON\'T KNOW </p><p>WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE SOUTH," BERRI EMPHASIZED.  BERRI </p><p>ALSO MENTIONED THAT HE ALWAYS URGES  THE RESISTANCE (I.E., </p><p>HIZBALLAH AND AMAL) NOT TO LAUNCH ATTACKS FROM INSIDE </p><p>VILLAGES.  SUCH ADVICE, IF HEEDED, WOULD DEPRIVE ISRAEL OF </p><p>AN EXCUSE TO RETURN FIRE AGAINST THESE VILLAGES.  BERRI </p><p>BELIEVED THE SITUATION, ALBEIT UNSTABLE, WAS BETTER THAN IN </p><p>THE PAST AND THAT DAMAGES WERE LESS THAN LAST YEAR.  HE WAS </p><p>PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE MEPP. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>EMILE LAHUD AND PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED BERRI ON HIS RECENT </p><p>REELECTION TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE AMAL MOVEMENT. </p><p>REFLECTING ON HIZBALLAH AS A RIVAL FOR POLITICAL PROMINENCE, </p><p>BERRI SAID THAT "ISRAEL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING </p><p>HIZBALLAH ALIVE," BY CONTINUING -- THROUGH ITS OCCUPATION OF </p><p>THE SOUTH -- TO PROVIDE A PLATFORM FROM WHICH HIZBALLAH </p><p>COULD ADVANCE ITS POLITICAL STANDING AS THE "NATIONAL </p><p>RESISTANCE."  BERRI WAS DISMISSIVE OF HIZBALLAH\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>SUSTAIN A PROMINENT POLITICAL ROLE ONCE THE "RESISTANCE" </p><p>ENDED.  (COMMENT:  THIS STRIKES US AS AN ALTOGETHER TOO ROSY </p><p>VIEW OF A LIKELY POST-ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL.  SHI\'A POLITICS: </p><p>AMAL -- AND BERRI IN PARTICULAR -- FACE SERIOUS CREDIBILITY </p><p>AND IDENTITY PROBLEMS IN THE SOUTH AND ON A NATIONAL LEVEL. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) TURNING TO PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS, BERRI MENTIONED </p><p>THAT GENERAL EMILE LAHUD APPEARED TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF </p><p>BECOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF LEBANON.  HE NOTED IN PASSING </p><p>THAT HE HAD ONCE RECOMMENDED NAMING EMILE LAHUD AS HEAD OF </p><p>THE ARMY DURING AMINE GEMAYEL\'S TERM IN OFFICE IN THE EARLY </p><p>1980S, BUT WAS OVERRULED IN FAVOR OF GEMAYEL\'S SELECTION OF </p><p>MICHEL AOUN.  OTHER CANDIDATES SUCH AS NASSIB LAHUD AND JEAN </p><p>OBEID ALSO HAD A CHANCE THOUGH, HE QUICKLY HEDGED.  BERRI </p><p>SAID HE WANTED TO FINISH WITH THE ELECTION BEFORE OCTOBER </p><p>15, BECAUSE THERE WERE OTHER IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE MATTERS </p><p>BEFORE PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) BERRI POSTULATED THAT BUILDING "INSTITUTIONS" WAS </p><p>THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT ENDURING SECTARIANISM WITHIN THE </p><p>LEBANESE BODY POLITIC; HE ALSO DISCOUNTED THE NOTION THAT </p><p>LAHUD\'S ELECTION MIGHT RESULT IN THE POLITICIZATION OF THE </p><p>ARMY.  ASKED IF A LAHUD PRESIDENCY RAISED THE SPECTRE IN </p><p>LEBANESE MINDS OF ARMY (OR MORE SPECIFICALLY G-2 MUKHABARAT) </p><p>INTERFERENCE IN DOMESTIC POLITICS -- THE LEGENDARY "DUALITY" </p><p>OR "IZDIWAJIYAH" OF PRESIDENT FUAD SHIBAB\'S RULE -- BERRI </p><p>STATED FORCEFULLY THAT LAHUD "WOULD BE AN EISENHOWER,"  AND </p><p>SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM THE LAF ONCE IN OFFICE.  "HE KNOWS </p><p>NEITHER WE (THE POLITICIANS) NOR THE SYRIANS WOULD ACCEPT </p><p>ANY "DUALITY."  (COMMENT:  OTHER PROMINENT LEBANESE </p><p>POLITICAL FIGURES -- AND WE -- ARE LESS CERTAIN, GIVEN THE </p><p>PROMINENT ROLE NOW PLAYED BY THE LAF G-2 (AT LAHUD\'S -- AND </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY SYRIAN -- DIRECTION) IN MONITORING POLITICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS AND PERSONALITIES.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) BERRI HIGHLIGHTED THREE MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS FOR A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT: CREDIBLE TO THE CHRISTIANS, ACCEPTABLE </p><p>TO THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND SATISFACTORY TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (I.E., THE SYRIANS AND OTHER </p><p>"FRIENDS").  HE EMPHASIZED THAT WHILE OTHER CANDIDATES MIGHT </p><p>EXCEL IN SOME OF THESE AREAS, ONLY LAHUD EMBODIED ALL THREE </p><p>CHARACTERISTICS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) BERRI SAID HE WANTED TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD </p><p>BE ABLE TO BRING THE CHRISTIANS BACK INTO THE POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMICAL LIFE OF THE NATION.  BERRI INSISTED THAT </p><p>CHRISTIANS HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE WAKE OF THE </p><p>MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS WHICH WERE CONDUCTED LAST MAY/JUNE. </p><p>CHRISTIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE BALLOTING DOUBLED THAT OF THE </p><p>SHI\'A IN PERCENTAGE TERMS AND REACHED 93 PERCENT </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE 21 CHRISTIAN MUNICIPALITIES IN SOUTH </p><p>LEBANON.  STRONGER CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP WOULD HELP TO OFFSET </p><p>THE OVERBEARING INFLUENCE OF THE PRIME MINISTER "AND CREATE </p><p>A BALANCE" IN THE (TRIPARTITE) PRESIDENCY (I.E., AN ALLY FOR </p><p>ME AGAINST HARIRI).  LAUNCHING INTO A WELL-REHEARSED </p><p>CRITIQUE OF THE PM, BERRI SAID HARIRI WAS NOT "A MAN OF </p><p>INSTITUTIONS."  IN A FINAL JAB AT THE PRIME MINISTER, BERRI </p><p>CLOSED SAYING, "HARIRI IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE </p><p>OF HIS INTERNATIONAL STATURE, BUT HARIRI DEALS WITH DOMESTIC </p><p>ISSUES LIKE A PRINCE IN SAUDI ARABIA.  WE HAVE NO PRINCES </p><p>HERE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER FERZLI ON SYRIAN INTEREST IN THE ELECTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ILY FERZLI, THE GREEK ORTHODOX DEPUTY SPEAKER WHO </p><p>HAS VERY CLOSE TIES WITH THE SYRIANS BUT LIMITED POLITICAL </p><p>CREDIBILITY IN LEBANON, TOLD THE AMBASSADOR IN A SUBSEQUENT </p><p>MEETING THAT GENERAL LAHUD HAD A GOOD CHANCE TO BECOME THE </p><p>NEXT PRESIDENT. REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZING TO THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>THAT HE, FERZLI, SHOULD BE SEEN AS A CHANNEL TO THE SYRIANS </p><p>AND POINTING OUT HOW INTIMATE HIS CONTACTS WERE WITH SENIOR </p><p>SYRIAN OFFICIALS, FERZLI STATED THAT LAHUD WAS BACKED BY </p><p>SYRIA, AND THAT WITHOUT SYRIAN SUPPORT LAHUD WOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO BUILD A UNIFIED ARMY.  "SYRIA PROTECTED LAHUD </p><p>AND MADE HIM A MINI-PRESIDENT," FERZLI ADDED.  FERZLI ECHOED </p><p>BERRI\'S COMMENT THAT THE ELECTION OF A MILITARY LEADER WOULD </p><p>NOT ENDANGER "DEMOCRACY IN LEBANON." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) FERZLI ALSO HEDGED HIS BETS, HOWEVER, NOTING THAT </p><p>"NOTHING IS FINAL."  AS IF TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT, FERZLI </p><p>COMMENTED THAT NEITHER BERRI NOR HARIRI HAD A REAL INTEREST </p><p>IN HAVING A STRONG PRESIDENT.  IN RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION ABOUT HIZBALLAH PREFERENCES, FERZLI </p><p>SAID THEY DO NOT WANT A STRONG PRESIDENT EITHER.  QUERIED ON </p><p>WHETHER LAHUD HAD A KNOWN PROGRAM HE INTENDED TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>IF ELECTED, FERZLI SAID EMPHATICALLY THAT LAHUD SHOULD NOT </p><p>HAVE A "PROGRAM,"  SINCE THAT WOULD ONLY ENGAGE HIM IN PETTY </p><p>DOMESTIC "POLITICAL SQUABBLES."  (READ:  WOULD INTERFERE </p><p>WITH THE ROLE OF THE PARLIAMENT.)  INSTEAD, THE NEW </p><p>PRESIDENT SHOULD BE A MORAL EXEMPLAR -- UNLIKE HRAWI -- AND </p><p>ACT TO STRENGTHEN THE CREDIBILITY AND INTEGRITY OF STATE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE HINGE ON THE PRESIDENCY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) FERZLI WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT BETTER GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>POSSIBLE IN LEBANON IF THERE ARE "ANGELS" AT THE LEVEL OF </p><p>THE TROIKA.  "IF WE HAVE DEVILS AT THE TROIKA LEVEL, ALL </p><p>OTHER OFFICIALS WILL ALSO TURN INTO DEVILS," FERZLI SURMISED </p><p>WRYLY.  FERZLI EXPECTED THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, UPON THE </p><p>RECOMMENDATION OF PRESIDENT HRAWI, TO CALL FOR AN </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF PARLIAMENT TO CONSIDER A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD PERMIT SENIOR CIVIL </p><p>SERVANTS SUCH AS LAHUD TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  IF THAT </p><p>SCENARIO DOES NOT TRANSPIRE, THE SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT CAN </p><p>PROPOSE SUCH A SESSION ONCE PARLIAMENT CONVENES ON OCTOBER </p><p>20.  AFTER OCTOBER 24, HOWEVER, PARLIAMENT CAN NO LONGER </p><p>CALL A SPECIAL SESSION TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  (NOTE: </p><p>THE LEBANESE CONSTITUTION IS COMPLEX ON THIS PROCEDURAL </p><p>ISSUE, AND IT NOT INTERNALLY CONSISTENT.  IN FACT, MOST </p><p>LEBANESE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT </p><p>WITH BROAD SUPPORT COULD BE PASSED WHENEVER NECESSARY, </p><p>THOUGH THE PERIOD BEFORE OCTOBER 24 WOULD SEEM MOST </p><p>CONVENIENT.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>SYRIAN STRATEGY IN LEBANON: WIN OVER THE CHRISTIANS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) FERZLI BELIEVED THAT SYRIA WAS NOW "INSIDE THE </p><p>LEBANESE REGIME," AND NO LONGER HAD AN INTEREST IN </p><p>DESTABILIZING LEBANON.  FERZLI ALSO STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF THE SYRIAN ROLE IN LEBANON, BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER A </p><p>PEACE AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED BETWEEN THE ARABS AND ISRAEL. </p><p>HE SAID "SYRIA, AND IN PARTICULAR, HAFEZ AL-ASAD, IS THE </p><p>ONLY ONE WHO CAN GIVE LEGITIMACY TO ANY PEACE BETWEEN THE </p><p>ARABS AND ISRAEL".  HE ALSO STATED THAT SYRIAN MILITARY </p><p>PREPAREDNESS IN LEBANON WAS A GUARANTEE FOR PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) FINALLY, FERZLI -- GETTING IN ONE LAST PRO-SARG </p><p>POINT -- ARGUED THAT ASAD WAS A "STRATEGIC THINKER" WHO </p><p>WANTS TO IMPROVE HIS RELATIONS WITH THE WESTERN WORLD, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE U.S.  THE PROVING GROUND FOR ASAD TO PROMOTE </p><p>HIS IMAGE ABROAD IS IN LEBANON.  FERZLI BELIEVED THE SYRIANS </p><p>WANTED TO ACHIEVE A RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE CHRISTIANS OF </p><p>LEBANON TO FACILITATE THIS END. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S PRESS COMMENTS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR MADE BRIEF REMARKS TO THE PRESS </p><p>FOLLOWING HIS MEETINGS AT THE PARLIAMENT, NOTING THAT "WE </p><p>HAVE CLEARLY UNDERLINED OUR SUPPORT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS IN LEBANON.  THE </p><p>U.S. HAS MADE CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS A </p><p>LEBANESE CHOICE.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE LEBANESE </p><p>ELECTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>SATTERFIELD </p><p></p></div>
