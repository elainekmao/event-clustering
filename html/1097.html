(C) ON JUNE 1 AMBASSADOR AND ECONOFF MET WITH </p><p>ISAAC TAKAWIRA, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BARCLAYS BANK, </p><p>AND WHOM WE REGARD AS AN EXCELLENT, WELL CONNECTED </p><p>AND INFORMED INTERLOCUTOR, TO DISCUSS ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>SITUATION AND OUTLOOK.  THE BANKER OPENED HIS SERIOUS </p><p>DIALOGUE BY STATING HOW WORRIED HE WAS ABOUT THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES, BOTH INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONALLY, OF </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE AND RESETTLEMENT PROCESS AS CURRENTLY </p><p>BEING HANDLED BY GOVERNMENT.  CALLING IT A DISASTER, </p><p>HE STATED IT WAS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT AND WOULD </p><p>NEGATIVELY AFFECT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, LEAVE </p><p>THE RESETTLED POPULACE MORE DESTITUTE IN THE FUTURE, </p><p>AND DESTROY THE CHANCES OF INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE PROGRAM.  (COMMENT: TAKAWIRA IS ALSO A LARGE- </p><p>SCALE TOBACCO FARMER IN HIS OWN RIGHT, EMPLOYING 2000 </p><p>FARM WORKERS.  HIS PROPERTY HAS NOT BEEN AFFECTED BY </p><p>THE RECENT INVASIONS.  CLOSELY AFFILIATED WITH THE </p><p>RULING PARTY AND MOVING AT EASE IN THE HIGHEST RANKS </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO </p><p>THIS.  TOBACCO FARMING GIVES TAKWIRA A GOOD SENSE OF </p><p>THE SENTIMENT OF A SIZABLE SEGMENT OF THE POPULACE. </p><p>END COMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE MANAGING DIRECTOR ALSO TOLD US THAT HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02952  01 OF 02  021047Z </p><p>BANK WAS RELATIVELY WELL-POSITIONED REGARDING ITS </p><p>EXPOSURE TO THE FARMING INDUSTRY, WHICH IS SUFFERING </p><p>ITS WORSE FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE INDEPENDENCE.  WHEN </p><p>HE TOOK OVER THE HELM IN 1992, BARCLAY\'S FARM-LENDING </p><p>BOOK CONSTITUTED 39 PERCENT OF TOTAL LOANS.  TODAY </p><p>THAT FIGURE IS DOWN TO 19 PERCENT AND IS HEAVILY </p><p>RESERVED AGAINST.  THE SHRINKAGE WAS DUE TO HIS </p><p>DECISION EIGHT YEARS AGO TO WRITE NO NEW FARM </p><p>BUSINESS, AS HE KNEW EVEN BACK THEN THAT THE </p><p>UNRESOLVED LAND ISSUE WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM WAITING TO </p><p>HAPPEN.  THOUGH HIS PRESCIENCE WAS VINDICATED, HIS </p><p>SENSE OF SHAME AND LOSS AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED WAS </p><p>EVIDENT AND HEARTFELT.  THE BULK OF THE BANK\'S </p><p>BUSINESS THESE DAYS IS LENDING TO CORPORATES, WITH </p><p>SUCH LOANS MAKING UP 65 TO 70 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) TAKAWIRA ALSO TOLD US THAT HE HAD RECENTLY </p><p>POINTED OUT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL A POTENTIAL </p><p>PROBLEM WITH THE LAND ACQUISITION PROGRAM AS </p><p>CURRENTLY STRUCTURED.  HE FURTHER EXPLAINED THAT THE </p><p>COMPENSATION PROCEDURES IN THE JUST-SIGNED </p><p>LEGISLATION WOULD PAY THE FARMERS IN IOU\'S (25 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE VALUE OF IMPROVEMENTS ON SEIZURE, 25 </p><p>PERCENT TWO YEARS LATER AND THE BALANCE FOUR OR FIVE </p><p>YEARS OUT, SEE REFTEL A) WHICH ONLY CARRY A 25 </p><p>PERCENT INTEREST RATE.  HIS BANK\'S LOWEST RATE IS </p><p>CURRENTLY 60.5 PERCENT, AND A COURT CASE WOULD SURELY </p><p>DECIDE FOR THE PLAINTIFFS THAT THEY WERE </p><p>UNDERCOMPENSATED AND DIRECT THE GOZ TO PAY MARKET </p><p>RATES.  THIS LEGALLY CHALENGABLE DISPARITY WOULD ONLY </p><p>MAKE A BAD PROGRAM WORSE, HE OPINED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02952  01 OF 02  021047Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ON THE ELECTIONS, TAKAWIRA REVEALED A </p><p>PERSONAL BELIEF THAT THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PARTY MAY DO MUCH BETTER IN </p><p>THE POLLS THAN IS WIDELY ASSUMED.  HE POINTEDLY TOLD </p><p>US STORIES OF CONVERSATIONS HE RECENTLY HAD WITH </p><p>RELATIVES OF HIS (AN UPPER RANK MILITARY OFFICER AND </p><p>TWO ELDERLY AUNTS), AS WELL AS THE SENTIMENT OF HIS </p><p>2000 FARM WORKERS.  SUCCINCTLY PUT, HIS MESSAGE WAS </p><p>THAT THESE DAYS EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY IS FOR ZANU- </p><p>PF -- UP UNTIL ELECTION DAY.  AN 80 OR 90 SEAT MDC </p><p>WIN WOULD NOT SURPIRSE HIM, AND HE ASKED OUR </p><p>ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT THE NEW GOVERNEMNT </p><p>WERE THIS TO OCCUR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ON OTHER TOPICS, NOTABLY THE FOREX SHORTAGE, </p><p>HE CONFIRMED THAT MANY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS WERE ON </p><p>THE VERGE OF SHUTDOWN DUE TO THEIR INABILITY TO PAY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIERS OR EVEN THEIR PARENT </p><p>COMPANIES.  FOR THE PAST FOUR MONTHS THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>COMPANIES HAD BEEN LIVING ON THE CREDIT AND SUPPORT </p><p>OF THEIR HISTORIC FRIENDS AND RELATIONS, BUT THESE </p><p>ARE ABOUT EXHAUSTED, WITH DIRE CONSEQUENCES.  AS A </p><p>SINGLE EXAMPLE HE CITED ZIMBABWE\'S LARGEST GOLD </p><p>PRODUCER WHICH CURRENTLY OPERATES EIGHT MINES, BUT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1174 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02952  02 OF 02  021047Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------5E49E8  021047Z /38 </p><p>O 021050Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6196 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002952 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, GRACE SONE </p><p>USDOC FOR ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/10 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, IBRD, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BARCLAYS BANK MANAGING DIRECTOR ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02952  02 OF 02  021047Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S WOES AND OUTLOOK </p><p> </p><p>WHICH IS BEING FORCED TO CLOSE SIX OF THEM DUE THE </p><p>HARD CURRENCY SHORTAGE.
