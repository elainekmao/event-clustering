(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador raised the issue of UAE </p><p>support for the Polish-led multinational division </p><p>with UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Muhammad bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ) via letter and a follow-up </p><p>phone call on June 28.  Attached to the letter was </p><p>the list of countries requiring transportation </p><p>assistance detailed reftel.  MbZ\'s Special </p><p>Assistant, Yousef Al-Otaiba, telephoned Polchief </p><p>June 30 with the UAE\'s official response.  The UAE </p><p>has agreed to provide transportation assistance to </p><p>the eight European countries listed, i.e. Poland, </p><p>Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, </p><p>Latvia and Romania.  Al-Otaiba said the UAE was </p><p>prepared to offer two "roll-on, roll-off" ships and </p><p>one hundred hours of an Aleutian 124 aircraft to </p><p>ferry the troops and their equipment to Iraq.  He </p><p>indicated that UAE GHQ Director of Operations </p><p>Brigadier Ali Al-Kaabi would be in touch with the </p><p>Embassy\'s Acting USLO Chief for specific </p><p>arrangements. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On the approach to Dubai Crown Prince and </p><p>UAE Defense Minister Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum </p><p>(MbR) regarding vehicles for Iraq and Afghanistan, </p><p>our Acting CG in Dubai has a meeting scheduled with </p><p>Sayanta Basu of The Investment Office on Tuesday, </p><p>July 1.  We will report on the details of that </p><p>meeting as soon as they are available. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  Given the UAE\'s finite military </p><p>transportation resources, we believe their pledge </p><p>to support the mobilization of the Polish-led </p><p>division based out of Europe is appropriate and, </p><p>indeed, quite generous.  The UAE military would </p><p>have been unable, in our opinion, to support the </p><p>transportation needs of troops from some of the </p><p>more far-flung areas of the globe. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
