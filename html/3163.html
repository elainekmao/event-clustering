<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 002982 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/C AND S/WCI, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KJUS, CG, CF, RW, IT, ICTR </p><p>SUBJECT: DRC PRESIDENT KABILA SUPPORTS NEW REWARDS FOR </p><p>JUSTICE PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 11370 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS FOR REA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02982  190758Z </p><p>SONS 1.5(B),(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  DRC PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA SAID THE NEW </p><p>REWARDS FOR JUSTICE IN RWANDA PROGRAM (REFTEL) HAS 100 </p><p>PERCENT OF HIS PERSONAL SUPPORT, AS WELL AS THAT OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, BUT HE ADDED THAT THE PROGRAM MUST LEAD TO </p><p>RWANDA\'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DRC OR IT WON\'T SUCCEED.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) WHILE IN ROME FOR THE FAO SUMMIT, KABILA MET WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE FOR WAR CRIMES PIERRE PROSPER AND DR. </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZIER (NSC) ON JUNE 13 TO DISCUSS THE RECENTLY </p><p>LAUNCHED REWARDS FOR JUSTICE IN RWANDA PROGRAM.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>PROSPER URGED KABILA TO SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE, WHICH FOCUSES </p><p>ON NINE TO FIFTEEN KEY SUSPECTS INDICTED FOR GENOCIDE BY THE </p><p>ICTR, AS A MEANS OF REMOVING RWANDA\'S EXCUSE FOR OCCUPYING </p><p>PARTS OF THE DRC.  AFTER OFFERING HIS FULL SUPPORT, KABILA </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT HIS PEOPLE MAY NOT TAKE THE IDEA SERIOUSLY. </p><p>KABILA STATED THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD ALSO WANT TO SEE </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MILLIONS OF CONGOLESE DEATHS OVER THE </p><p>PAST FEW YEARS IN THE EASTERN CONGO, INCLUDING THOSE WHO DIED </p><p>IN KISANGANI ONLY WEEKS AGO.  HE ENCOURAGED AMB. PROSPER TO </p><p>BE PREPARED TO ANSWER THE TOUGH QUESTIONS HE WOULD ENCOUNTER </p><p>FROM AVERAGE CITIZENS OR THE PROGRAM WOULD LOSE CREDIBILITY. </p><p>OUR PRIORITY IS TO SEE RWANDA OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, KABILA </p><p>STRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  BOTH AMB. PROSPER AND DR. FRAZIER EMPHASIZED THAT THE </p><p>PROGRAM IS ONE PART OF A MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO RESTORING </p><p>STABILITY IN THE REGION.  IF THIS LEADERSHIP GROUP CAN BE </p><p>REMOVED FROM THE EQUATION, RWANDA WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02982  190758Z </p><p>CLAIM THAT A SECURITY THREAT EXISTS THAT WARRANTS ITS </p><p>OCCUPATION OF PARTS OF THE DRC.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>CAN THEN PRESSURE RWANDA TO WITHDRAW.  KABILA COMMENTED THAT </p><p>HE WOULD PREFER MILITARY PRESSURE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE FOR </p><p>SUCH A COMPLICATED PROBLEM, BUT REAFFIRMED HIS SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE REWARDS PROGRAM.  HE INVITED AMB. PROSPER TO PRESENT THE </p><p>PROGRAM IN KINSHASA THE SECOND WEEK IN JULY.  AMB. PROSPER </p><p>ADDED THAT HE HAD MET WITH RWANDAN PRESIDENT KAGAME ABOUT THE </p><p>PROGRAM AND HAD EXPLAINED THAT A RWANDAN WITHDRAWAL WAS A </p><p>PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) KABILA ASKED HOW THE INITIATIVE WOULD BE COORDINATED </p><p>WITH THE ICTR.  AMB. PROSPER EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD MET WITH </p><p>CARLA DEL PONTE AND INVESTIGATOR WALPIN, AND HAD SET UP A </p><p>TASK FORCE IN KENYA TO RESPOND TO LEADS ON ONE OF THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL INDICTEES, KABUGA. A SIMILAR SET-UP WAS ENVISIONED </p><p>FOR KINSHASA, WITH AN AMERICAN LINKED TO ARUSHA AND WORKING </p><p>WITH THE CONGOLESE TO FOLLOW UP ON TIPS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) KABILA SAID A SOLUTION WAS NEEDED FOR THOSE RWANDESE </p><p>BEING HELD IN KAMINA AND THE FOOT SOLDIERS.  AMB. PROSPER </p><p>OFFERED THAT THE REWARDS PROGRAM WOULD HELP HERE TOO BY </p><p>"CUTTING OFF THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE," LEAVING LOWER-LEVEL </p><p>SOLDIERS.  AMB. PROSPER NOTED THAT RWANDAN OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>SAID THAT RWANDA WILL ACCEPT THE REPATRIATION OF THESE FOOT </p><p>SOLDIERS ONCE THE LEADERS INDICTED BY THE ICTR HAVE BEEN </p><p>APPREHENDED.  WHEN PRESSED BY KABILA AS TO HOW LONG IT WOULD </p><p>TAKE, AMB. PROSPER REPLIED THAT KABILA\'S HELP WITH </p><p>APPREHENDING THE INDICTEES WAS CRUCIAL; WORKING TOGETHER, </p><p>WITH THE ICTR, MONUS AND OTHER ENTITIES, TO TAKE THEM INTO </p><p>CUSTODY WOULD TAKE A "REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME, NOT YEARS," </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02982  190758Z </p><p>AMB. PROSPER ESTIMATED.  HE STRESSED, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>ACTUAL APPREHENSION WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE BY THE DRC. </p><p>APPREHENDING THE LEADERS WOULD NOT RESULT IN RWANDA\'S </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DRC THE NEXT DAY, DR. FRAZIER ADMITTED, </p><p>BUT IT WOULD BE A KEY ELEMENT IN THE OVERALL EFFORT TO END </p><p>THE CONFLICT AND WOULD BRING TREMENDOUS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRESSURE ON RWANDA TO WITHDRAW FROM THE DRC. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN TALKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE PRESS FOLLOWING THE </p><p>MEETING, AMB. PROSPER NOTED KABILA\'S SUPPORT FOR THE REWARDS </p><p>PROGRAM, AND STRESSED THE NEED TO ENSURE THESE EFFORTS LEAD </p><p>TO A RWANDAN WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DRC.  HE MENTIONED KAGAME </p><p>HAD ALSO EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE INITIATIVE, AND EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT IT WOULD TAKE A TEAM EFFORT TO SUCCEED IN BRINGING THE </p><p>INDICTEES TO JUSTICE.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT MONUC, </p><p>KABILA TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE REUNIFICATION OF THE DRC IS </p><p>THE PRIORITY - ANYTHING THAT ISN\'T MOVING TOWARD THAT IS A </p><p>WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) THIS CABLE HAS BEEN CLEARED BY AMBASSADOR PROSPER. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02982 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
