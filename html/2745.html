PATTERSON.  REASON: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, MILITARY AND </p><p>CIVILIAN INTERLOCUTORS UNEQUIVOCALLY CONFIRM THE </p><p>EXISTENCE OF FARC CAMPS IN VENEZUELA (REFTEL). EMBASSY </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS IN THE GOC FEEL THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY HAS </p><p>BEEN ACTIVELY ORDERED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS TO TURN A </p><p>BLIND EYE TO FARC AND ELN CAMPS.  A RELIABLE SOURCE GAVE </p><p>POLOFF DESCRIPTIONS AND COORDINATES FOR CAMPS IN </p><p>VENEZUELA. THE GOC, FOR THE TIME BEING, IS PROBABLY </p><p>CONTENT TO LET THE ISSUE PLAY OUT IN THE PRESS AND WAIT </p><p>TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO CHAVEZ.  THE COLMIL, HOWEVER, WILL </p><p>MOST LIKELY CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SEVERAL SOURCES, INCLUDING A COLMIL HELICOPTER </p><p>PILOT (REFTEL), THE ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER, AND A </p><p>REPORTER FOR EL TIEMPO, COLOMBIA\'S LEADING DAILY, HAVE </p><p>GIVEN REPORTS ON HOW TO ARRIVE AT FARC CAMPS IN </p><p>VENEZUELA.  THE ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER GAVE POLCOUNS A </p><p>MAP WITH THE SITE OF ONE FARC CAMP APPROXIMATELY 1.2 </p><p>MILES INTO VENEZUELAN TERRITORY HIGHLIGHTED (8-45-10N,72- </p><p>40-15W). NOTE: POST WILL PROVIDE A COPY TO WHA/AND. END </p><p>NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DIRECTIONS WERE GIVEN TO EMBOFF BY A REPORTER FROM </p><p>EL TIEMPO INDICATING THAT SHE DROVE FOR 35 MINUTES AFTER </p><p>ENTERING VENEZUELA TO GET TO ONE OF THE CAMPS AND FOR 20 </p><p>MINUTES TO GET TO THE OTHER.  THE CAMPS SHE VISITED WERE </p><p>ACROSS THE BORDER FROM TIBU, NORTE DE SANTANDER. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) SEPARATELY, A VERY RELIABLE COLOMBIAN SOURCE </p><p>GAVE EMBOFF THE COORDINATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF SEVERAL </p><p>FARC CAMPS IN VENEZUELA.  THE SOURCE SAID THESE CAMPS </p><p>REPRESENTED "THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG," BUT WERE INDICATIVE </p><p>OF THE LEVEL TO WHICH THE FARC HAS SET UP OPERATIONS IN </p><p>VENEZUELA.  HE ELABORATED THAT IT IS AN OPEN SECRET FOR </p><p>THE VENEZUELANS THAT THESE CAMPS EXIST.  A CAMP IN THE </p><p>AREA FROM WHICH THE ATTACK ON CARRENO\'S TROOPS PROBABLY </p><p>CAME IS LOCATED IN VENEZUELA DIRECTLY OPPOSITE FROM A </p><p>COLOMBIAN AIRSTRIP.  THE LOCATION OF THE CAMP IS 09-08- </p><p>18N, 072-50-54W.  THE CAMP IS REPORTEDLY CAPABLE OF </p><p>HOUSING BETWEEN 100-120 FARC GUERRILLAS.  ANOTHER CAMP </p><p>ABOUT ONE KILOMETER INTO VENEZUELAN TERRITORY IS LOCATED </p><p>ON THE SOCUAVO DEL SUR RIVER (0859N, 07233W). </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) THE SOURCE ALSO GAVE INFORMATION ABOUT A CAMP </p><p>LOCATED ON THE CATATUMBO RIVER ACROSS FROM NORTE DE </p><p>SANTANDER DEPARTMENT NORTH OF THE CITY OF CUCUTA (9-21N, </p><p>072-44W) IN WHICH ABOUT 120 FARC GUERRILLAS WERE COUNTED </p><p>IN LATE FEBRUARY.  ANOTHER CAMP HAS ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED </p><p>ACROSS THE BORDER FROM RIO DE ORO (08-37N, 072-39W). </p><p>ANOTHER CAMP LOCATED NEAR SAN SIMON DE CUCUY (01168N, </p><p>066509W) HAS A GRASS AIRSTRIP.  YET ANOTHER CAMP WHICH </p><p>APPEARS TO BE A TRAINING FACILITY IS LOCATED IN THE AREA </p><p>OF GUASDUALITO, APURE DEPARTMENT, VENEZUELA (07-15N, 70- </p><p>44W).  UNIDENTIFIED FOREIGN ADVISORS HAVE REPORTEDLY BEEN </p><p>SEEN IN THIS CAMP. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) SINCE CHAVEZ CAME TO POWER, THE GOV HAS BROKEN OFF </p><p>SEVERAL LONGSTANDING GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONTACTS, </p><p>INCLUDING MILITARY TO MILITARY CONTACTS IN SEPTEMBER, </p><p>2000. THE GOC HAS REITERATED ITS DESIRE TO REINSTATE THE </p><p>COLOMBIA-VENEZUELA BORDER COMMISSION AS IT TRIES TO </p><p>MANAGE THE LATEST BORDER CRISIS IN A DIPLOMATIC WAY THAT </p><p>WILL NOT PLACE FURTHER STRAIN ON THE ALREADY DELICATE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIP.  AFTER HAVING A UNIT AMBUSHED </p><p>AND LOSING TROOPS TO FARC UNITS OPERATING OUT OF </p><p>VENEZUELA ON MARCH 19, COLOMBIAN ARMY SECOND DIVISION </p><p>COMMANDER GENERAL MARTIN CARRENO FELT THE NEED TO </p><p>PUBLICLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS HIS TROOPS WERE FACING </p><p>(REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  THERE IS A MOUNTING BODY OF HARD </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE FARC GUERRILLA CAMPS IN </p><p>VENEZUELA. THE GOC, FOR THE TIME BEING, IS PROBABLY </p><p>CONTENT TO LET THE ISSUE PLAY OUT IN THE PRESS AND WAIT </p><p>TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO CHAVEZ.  THE COLMIL, HOWEVER, WILL </p><p>MOST LIKELY CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT, ESPECIALLY, IF THE </p><p>ATTACKS FROM VENEZUELA LEAD TO MORE DEATHS AMONG </p><p>COLOMBIAN UNITS, THE SPARK THAT LED GENERAL CARRENO TO GO </p><p>PUBLIC IN THE MOST RECENT EVENT. POLOFFS WILL VISIT </p><p>BUCARAMANGA, THE SITE OF SECOND DIVISION HEADQUARTERS, </p><p>THE WEEK OF APRIL 15 TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE WITH GENERAL </p><p>CARRENO AND HIS STAFF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p></p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
