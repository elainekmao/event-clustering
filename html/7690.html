<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 LAGOS 000886 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL -- MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, PINR, KDEM, ASEC, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SOUTH-SOUTH ELECTION LOSERS PLAY WAITING </p><p>GAME </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL-ECON CHIEF JOSEPH GREGOIRE.  REASON:  1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) SUMMARY.  In Nigeria\'s South-south, all six of the </p><p>incumbent governors of the ruling People\'s Democratic Party </p><p>(PDP) had their reelection confirmed by the Independent </p><p>National Electoral Commission (INEC) after the April 19 </p><p>election.  The degree of election tampering varied starkly </p><p>across and within the region\'s states (details to follow </p><p>septel).  Similarly, the losing parties are engaging in </p><p>divergent tactics in response to the reported outcomes, </p><p>ranging from "if you can\'t beat \'em, join \'em" to "let\'s </p><p>bring back military rule and attack the oil companies." </p><p>Though cause for monitoring, most of the losers\' rhetoric can </p><p>be dismissed as bluster.  The likelihood of their grievances\' </p><p>being redressed by legal or extralegal means is slim at best. </p><p> Delta, Edo, and Rivers states offer comparative examples of </p><p>the major themes reverberating from the losing parties\' </p><p>drums.  Meanwhile, the generality of the population they </p><p>profess to represent may disengage from politics at least </p><p>until 2007, when they may next have a chance to elect </p><p>representative candidates.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE BAD: DELTA STATE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE PROCESS: Both the national legislative elections </p><p>on April 12th and gubernatorial-presidential elections on the </p><p>19th displayed marked variation between the inland areas and </p><p>the riverine and coastal areas of Delta State.  Within the </p><p>capital\'s local government areas (LGAs), elections were </p><p>conducted reasonably well; in the swamps, elections were </p><p>essentially a sham (septel to elaborate on Poloff </p><p>observations in Delta). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CONTESTING THE OUTCOME: Governor James Ibori\'s </p><p>runner-up was Chief Great Ogboru from the Alliance for </p><p>Democracy (AD) ticket.  In his most significant statement so </p><p>far, Ogboru denied having declared victory, but stopped short </p><p>of conceding defeat.  Ogboru\'s statement followed the </p><p>announcement that police were investigating him for falsely </p><p>claiming victory before the INEC results were announced, and </p><p>the State Security Service (SSS) reportedly invited him for </p><p>an interview as well.  Police arrested five suspects, </p><p>including the radio station proprietor and his staff, for </p><p>allegedly airing news that Ogboru had won in Effurun on the </p><p>20th. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) At least one defeated AD candidate, Sunny Uwode of an </p><p>Ethiope constituency, was arrested.  Other unsuccessful </p><p>candidates have called for cancellation of the National </p><p>Assembly election results and the removal of Police </p><p>Commissioner John Ahmada.  The All Nigeria People\'s Party </p><p>(ANPP), a major competitor though less visible in Delta as an </p><p>adversary than in other states, has launched its share of </p><p>contests against the polls.  ANPP\'s House of Representatives </p><p>candidate for Warri, Bolatsi Omatseye Dudu, petitioned the </p><p>state INEC after elections were postponed in his district, </p><p>but has yet to receive word that any will be rescheduled. </p><p>TheIgbo-based All People\'s Grand Alliance (APGA), whic had </p><p>a measurable showing in the national legisltive and </p><p>gubernatorial elections, has been less ocal in Delta about </p><p>contesting its losses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE VERY BAD: EDO STATE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE PROCESS: The PDP construed its overwhelming </p><p>victory over th ANPP\'s competition as evidence that the </p><p>party\'s core support is limited to the North.  Observers </p><p>noted major irregularities from the capital through the </p><p>outlying areas.  During the months leading up to the </p><p>elections, many of the PDP\'s rival politicians asserted </p><p>having been the subjects of assaults, arrests, and </p><p>intimidation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CONTESTING THE OUTCOME: No united front is likely to </p><p>challenge the outcome of Edo\'s gubernatorial election. </p><p>Governor Lucky Igbinedion\'s main challenger was ANPP\'s </p><p>Senator Roland Owie, followed by the AD\'s Dr. Odion Ojo, the </p><p>National Conscience Party\'s (NCP) Osagie Obayuwana, the </p><p>United Nigeria Peoples Party\'s (UNPP) Dr. Clement Alile, and </p><p>the NDP\'s Harry Igiehon.  The ANPP in Edo has been torn for </p><p>months by internal wrangling.  Nowa Omorogbe, special </p><p>assistant to the Governor\'s wife, told Poloff, "One of Owie\'s </p><p>competitors from the ANPP\'s gubernatorial primaries, Matthew </p><p>Urhoghide, has already publicly accepted the Governor\'s </p><p>reelection.  We think Owie will eventually accept it too." </p><p>In the meantime, the course Owie\'s camp appears likely to </p><p>take is to publicly denounce the elections as flawed, and see </p><p>the reaction they get without hoping for much result.  Owie\'s </p><p>party agent Isaiah Osifo, who was "manhandled" and his "life </p><p>threatened by PDP loyalists" at the state collation center, </p><p>thought the PDP should have left him to "celebrate the </p><p>decision of his conscience while they went about celebrating </p><p>their victory."  (Osifo was himself a PDP member until </p><p>defecting to ANPP in March.)  Another Osifo, Eddy Ehi Osifo, </p><p>gubernatorial candidate of the Movement for Democracy and </p><p>Justice (MDJ), publicly rejected the election results on </p><p>April 23, but said he would focus on ways to counter fraud in </p><p>future elections rather than contest the outcome of the last </p><p>elections.  In short, the PDP anticipates that some of the </p><p>competition "will write to the courts," but "nobody will take </p><p>to the streets.  If they do, they will be arrested." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>THE VERY, VERY BAD: RIVERS STATE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE PROCESS: In Rivers, poloffs witnessed outright </p><p>rigging and ballot stuffing throughout the state in both the </p><p>national legislative and the gubernatorial-presidential </p><p>elections.  Massive vote rigging took place with the </p><p>egregious collaboration of PDP agents and security personnel. </p><p> In no LGAs did foreign or domestic observers find the </p><p>process remotely approaching free or fair elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CONTESTING THE OUTCOME: The major challenger to </p><p>Rivers Governor Peter Odili was ANPP\'s Chief Sergeant Chidi </p><p>Awuse.  He may seek redress via the courts, but does not </p><p>share the Rivers State ANPP secretary\'s radical minority </p><p>viewpoint that "the army should take over the country and </p><p>people should start blowing up oil pipelines in Rivers </p><p>State."  Some candidates from the losing parties have already </p><p>decamped to the PDP, such as House of Assembly aspirant from </p><p>the National Democratic Party (NDP) Benibo Granville.  Saying </p><p>the elections in Rivers thus far have been "free but not </p><p>fair," Granville decided to follow former NDP gubernatorial </p><p>candidate Dumo Lulu Briggs, who withdrew from the race.  The </p><p>"high level of corruption inherent in Nigerian political </p><p>elections, which adversely affected all the opposition </p><p>parties", provoked Lulu Briggs\'s decision.  Other parties </p><p>are weighing the merits of pursuing what appears to be a lost </p><p>cause by contesting the election outcomes, against the </p><p>potential gains to be had from supporting the party that </p><p>cheated them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ANPP\'s other losing candidates have decided to take </p><p>their cues for further action from the party\'s national </p><p>leadership. ANPP collective stance is that no elections have </p><p>taken place to date in Rivers.  Ben Naanen, ANPP senatorial </p><p>candidate for Southeast Rivers, confirmed to Poloff his </p><p>belief that no elections took place in his constituency on </p><p>April 12 and characterized the election as President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s "civilian coup d\'etat."  (The only ward where </p><p>Naanen carried the vote was in his stronghold of Ogoniland, </p><p>where President Ledum Mitee of the Movement for the Survival </p><p>of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) resides.) Although Naanen feels </p><p>the losing candidates are not obliged to accept the outcome, </p><p>he intends to follow whatever course of action is charted </p><p>from the ANPP\'s top leadership and General Buhari.  This </p><p>would not extend, however, to Buhari\'s reported calls for </p><p>military intervention.  "I can\'t imagine ANPP calling for a </p><p>military coup," Naanen said.  "We wouldn\'t support that." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The South-south holds Nigeria\'s most critical </p><p>resources, the arteries of the Federal Government: oil, gas, </p><p>and a few refineries, ports and export-import processing </p><p>zones.  The PDP-controlled GON is unlikely to tolerate legal </p><p>challenges to the PDP\'s victories in the region.  The </p><p>question of INEC and the judicial system\'s impartiality </p><p>aside, the losing candidates\' potential recourse is limited </p><p>(septel to follow on judicial system\'s preparations for </p><p>election challenges in court). South-south public opinion </p><p>seems to be leaning toward acknowledging the futility of </p><p>challenging the outcomes if not agreeing with the PDP </p><p>victory.  Without popular backing for a massive challenge to </p><p>the outcome of the elections, the losing parties are unlikely </p><p>to get far. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT CONT\'D. We do not think it unwise for us to </p><p>dismiss most of the defeated candidates\' rhetoric as bluster. </p><p> They know that the likelihood of their grievances\' being </p><p>redressed by legal or extralegal means is slim at best. </p><p>Those who might persist in challenging the election outcomes </p><p>outside of the courts would almost surely face arrest on </p><p>grounds of sedition or risk violent encounters with armed </p><p>personnel, ranging from military forces in Delta\'s Warri and </p><p>Escravos areas to police and state security throughout the </p><p>South.  Menwhie the PDP will continue to consolidate its </p><p>power i the coming weeks.  The electorate will react by </p><p>hoosing one of three options: mounting organized eforts to </p><p>sway the state and local governments toard policies they </p><p>favor, looking to 2007 as thei next chance to elect </p><p>representative candidates,or disengaging from politics with </p><p>apathy.  Unfortunately, the last option is apt to be the </p><p>choice f the much-abused population.  END COMMENT. </p><p>GREGIRE </p><p></p></div>
