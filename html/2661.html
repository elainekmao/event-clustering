ON THE SURFACE, IT SMACKS OF DEFIANCE AND </p><p>    ARROGANCE, BUT IT IS REALLY A CRY OF PAIN AND </p><p>    REJECTION. . .  WHAT MNAGNGAGWA AND HIS COLLEAGUES </p><p>    OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT ZIMBABWE HAS BEEN </p><p>    SUSPENDED BECAUSE ZANU PF CHEATED IN THE RECENT </p><p>    PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. . .  IN A SMALL WAY, THE </p><p>    COMMONWEALTH DECISION TO SUSPENDED ZIMBABWE MUST </p><p>    SERVE TO REMIND MUGABE THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD </p><p>    IS WATCHING HIS EVERY MOVE AND WILL POUNCE ON HIM </p><p>    IF HE CONTINUES TO STRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT AND </p><p>    NARROW PATH OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. </p><p> </p><p>    ". . .WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO RESTORE THE DIGNITY </p><p>    OF THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD </p><p>    IS FOR MUGABE. . .TO END THE VIOLENCE AGAINST HIS </p><p>    OWN PEOPLE, TO PUT THE WAR VETERANS IN THEIR PLACE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00735  210922Z </p><p>    ONCE AND FOR ALL, TO ABANDON THE TRAINING OF </p><p>    MISGUIDED, JOBLESS YOUTHS INTO PARTY MEDIA, NOT AS </p><p>    ENEMIES OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY, BUT AS PATRIOTS AS </p><p>    ANXIOUS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR COUNTRY AS HE </p><p>    AND ZANU PF OUGHT TO BE.
