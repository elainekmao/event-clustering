<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 002033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA, NEA/PD, ECA </p><p>DOJ FOR BSWARTZ </p><p>DEPT PASS PRESIDENT\'S SCIENCE ADVISOR/WJEFFREYS </p><p>DEPT PASS HOMELAND SECURITY FOR BICE/GARCIA </p><p>DEPT PASS TREASURY FOR U/S JOHN TAYLOR </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO MISSION </p><p> </p><p>FROM ORHA/BAGHDAD -- JLIMBERT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SCUL, MOPS, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  REPORTED LOSSES AT NORTHERN SITES: IN SEARCH OF </p><p>NIMROD\'S GOLD </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY.  U.S. forces have stopped the looting by </p><p>tribal raiders at the Assyrian site at Nimrod, about 25 </p><p>kilometers south of Mosul; but not before the raiders had </p><p>made off with pieces of an eighth century B.C. stone relief. </p><p>The Mosul museum has yet to inventory its losses, but during </p><p>a 5/10 visit we found several Assyrian slabs taken, and both </p><p>Hatrian and Islamic displays untouched.   The Ninevah site, </p><p>in Mosul town, lost several pieces of seventh century B.C. </p><p>reliefs excavated recently by Italian teams.  In a related </p><p>series of events, ORHA has temporarily stopped an attempt by </p><p>National Geographic photo team to have Iraq Central Bank </p><p>vaults opened and to film "discovery" of Nimrod gold </p><p>reportedly hidden there.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ASSYRIAN PIECES LOST FROM MOSUL MUSEUM </p><p> </p><p>2.   I accompanied Dr. Jaber Khalil, chief of the State </p><p>Antiquities and Heritage Organization, on a trip to Mosul on </p><p>5/10/03 to visit the Mosul museum and the Assyrian sites at </p><p>Ninevah (in Mosul town) and Nimrod (about 25 kilometers </p><p>south).  Dr. Menhal, the regional inspector of antiquities </p><p>told us the museum staff was still making an inventory of </p><p>losses.   So far they had identified about 10 Assyrian </p><p>pieces lost, mostly slabs from friezes.  They believed the </p><p>museum\'s Hatrian and Islamic collections are intact.   They </p><p>have yet to inventory the losses or damage from the museum </p><p>storerooms.   While the library and card catalogue appeared </p><p>safe, the offices and laboratories were looted and </p><p>vandalized - as happened at the Iraqi National Museum in </p><p>Baghdad.   An older building of the museum remains under the </p><p>control of a political party of no fixed address. </p><p> </p><p>3.   The state of the Mosul Museum\'s records remains </p><p>uncertain.   We asked Menhal to provide photos and </p><p>descriptions of missing objects as soon as possible, so that </p><p>we could get these items on a red list.   In many cases, </p><p>good photos may not be available, but we should be able to </p><p>get at least a written description of the most important </p><p>missing pieces. </p><p> </p><p>MORE ASSYRIAN PIECES LOST AT NINEVAH AND NIMROD </p><p> </p><p>4.   At the extensive mound that is the ruin of Ninevah, we </p><p>found evidence that thieves had gone after some of the </p><p>reliefs recently excavated by Italian archeologists. </p><p>Looters had attacked, perhaps with pick-axes, a section of </p><p>wall and removed a slab measuring perhaps one foot by three </p><p>feet. </p><p> </p><p>5.   At Nimrod, the magnificent ninth-eighth century B.C. </p><p>Assyrian site about 25 kilometers south of Mosul, U.S. </p><p>forces have been guarding the site for about seven days. </p><p>They appeared after thieves from surrounding villages </p><p>overcame the local guards and made off with two slabs of bas- </p><p>relief, each measuring about 18 inches square.   They had </p><p>attempted without success to remove other pieces. </p><p> </p><p>6.   The U.S. Army lieutenant in charge of the detachment at </p><p>Nimrod said that his unit had previously been guarding a </p><p>looted and ruined sugar factory, and were gratified finally </p><p>to be protecting something of value.  Inspector Menhal and </p><p>regional director of excavations M. Mozahem, added that only </p><p>U.S. forces (or Iraqis from a different region) could </p><p>guarantee security at Nimrod, because even armed Iraqi </p><p>guards feared that killing or wounding an attacker would </p><p>provoke a blood feud and put their (the guards\') families in </p><p>danger. </p><p> </p><p>FINDING THE GOLD: POWER PLAY AND PUBLICITY STUNT </p><p> </p><p>7.   At Nimrod, we saw the site where in 1988 Iraqi </p><p>archeologists discovered numerous gold objects - estimated </p><p>weight from 70 to 300 kilograms -- from a woman\'s grave. </p><p>Since their discovery, the objects were on display only once </p><p>for a brief period in 1991-2.  Mozahim told us he had last </p><p>seen them at the Central Bank in 1998, when he was preparing </p><p>a book on the discovery. </p><p> </p><p>8.   The Nimrod gold and its fate remain controversial and </p><p>divisive.   Feeding the controversy is intense rivalry and </p><p>factionalism within the Iraq State Antiquities Department, </p><p>where the current director believes that his predecessor - </p><p>who claims credit for the treasure\'s discovery in 1988 - is </p><p>attempting to re-enter the Antiquities Department through </p><p>the back door by encouraging a team from National Geographic </p><p>to press for opening the vaults at the ruined Central Bank </p><p>building and for exclusive rights to film the "discovery" of </p><p>the treasure. </p><p> </p><p>9.   Working with ORHA colleagues, we have managed </p><p>temporarily to stop this effort, which museum officials </p><p>insist is unwise and is in reality a combination of well- </p><p>financed publicity stunt and power play.   Opening the Iraqi </p><p>Central Bank vaults and exposing their contents at this time </p><p>poses very difficult questions: Who can authorize opening </p><p>the vaults?  Who knows what their contents should be?  Who </p><p>will be accountable for lost or missing objects?  And, who, </p><p>on behalf of the non-existent Iraqi government, will be </p><p>responsible for receiving and guaranteeing the security of </p><p>the valuable objects purportedly stored in the vaults? </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
