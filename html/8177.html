(U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE RICHARD ALBRIGHT </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Because of the sensitivities </p><p>associated with Human Appeal International </p><p>(HAI), we have requested an appointment with </p><p>de facto Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamdan Bin </p><p>Zayid to deliver reftel points.  Hamdan, our </p><p>primary leadership-level contact on terrorist </p><p>financing issues, is currently traveling </p><p>outside the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  However, in anticipation of his </p><p>likely response to our demarche, we would </p><p>appreciate receiving (via ORCA channels if </p><p>necessary) a releasable intel package which we </p><p>may provide to the UAEG in support of our </p><p>request that they crack down on Human Appeal. </p><p>The information on Ayoub Ali and Boudella Al- </p><p>Haj is specific and compelling, but we have </p><p>no/no direct supporting information with </p><p>regard to HAI\'s funding of Hamas.  If we want </p><p>the UAEG to block HAI funding of Hamas, it </p><p>would be helpful to give them evidence that </p><p>such funding has occurred in the past and is </p><p>continuing, including the specific </p><p>entities/accounts belonging to Hamas into </p><p>which HAI funds are flowing.  Similarly, </p><p>details with regard to the Al-Rashid Trust\'s </p><p>continuing operations in the UAE would be most </p><p>helpful.  We note that the UAE Central Bank </p><p>has already ordered financial institutions </p><p>here -- at our request -- to freeze any </p><p>accounts associated with the Al-Rashid Trust. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  When we went to the UAE to request </p><p>their partnership with us in closing Al- </p><p>Barakat operations here we were able to submit </p><p>to them a lengthy intel package outlining the </p><p>reasons why we believed that organization was </p><p>involved in terrorist financing.  A similar </p><p>package on HAI will demonstrate that we are </p><p>motivated by solid fact and that we are </p><p>serious about having the UAEG take appropriate </p><p>action to block HAI funding of terrorist </p><p>groups.  A strong intel package should give </p><p>the Emirati authorities the compelling </p><p>information they will need to intiate their </p><p>own investigation and take the necessary steps </p><p>to ensure HAI is not funding -- wittingly or </p><p>unwittingly -- terrorist groups. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
