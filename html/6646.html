<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000725 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA, WHA/CEN, WHA/EPSC, AND WHA/PDA </p><p>STATE FOR EB, IIP/G/WHA, AND DS/OP/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EPET, OIIP, ASEC, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN PRESIDENT MADURO ADDRESSES NATION ON IRAQ: </p><p>CALLS FOR CALM AND DOES NOT MENTION SUPPORT FOR U.S. POLICY </p><p> </p><p>REF: Tegucigalpa 698 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Honduran President Ricardo Maduro addressed </p><p>the nation the evening of March 20 on the war in Iraq and </p><p>possible implications for Honduras.  His basic message was </p><p>that the war may cause hardships, but there was no reason to </p><p>panic and that Hondurans should stick together.  He stated </p><p>that oil importers have assured the government that there </p><p>will be no problem with the supply of gasoline.  Maduro also </p><p>announced that he had cancelled his planned trip to Italy </p><p>for the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) meeting due to </p><p>the war.  He did not mention GOH support for U.S. policy on </p><p>Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Begin text of informal Embassy translation of </p><p>President Maduro\'s speech: </p><p> </p><p>Fellow-citizens, as you all know, the United States, leading </p><p>a coalition of countries, has begun the attack on Iraq, </p><p>which will last until the leader of that country steps </p><p>aside. </p><p> </p><p>These are moments of worldwide uncertainty and even though </p><p>we are far from the war scenario, it is possible that there </p><p>will be some effect on Honduras.  For this reason, I </p><p>cancelled my trip to the meeting with the Governors of the </p><p>Inter-American Development Bank in Milan, because these also </p><p>are moments to be together and united in our country. </p><p> </p><p>I would like to begin by sending a calming message to the </p><p>citizens of Honduras and by discussing the security measures </p><p>that I have taken to guarantee security. </p><p> </p><p>On the issue of energy, I have once again talked with the </p><p>fuel distributors who have guaranteed the supply of all </p><p>petroleum derivatives. </p><p> </p><p>We have initiated at the government level a program of fuel </p><p>savings and I believe it would be a good idea if citizens </p><p>would also voluntarily undertake such measures. </p><p> </p><p>Simple steps such as using public transportation whenever </p><p>possible; avoiding rush hours, making combined trips with </p><p>friends or co-workers - if all citizens would undertake </p><p>these - without doubt the consumption of fuel would go down </p><p>without any noticeable effect on our way of living. </p><p> </p><p>I am also making sure that the important basics such as </p><p>medicine and food continue to be available. </p><p> </p><p>Citizens should keep calm at all times and go to their </p><p>places of work, production and study, so that we can </p><p>maintain the nation\'s progress. </p><p> </p><p>Even though we are not taking an active part in the </p><p>conflict, I have ordered extraordinary measures to guarantee </p><p>the security of airports, power centers, marine ports, </p><p>hydroelectric dams and thermal plants. </p><p> </p><p>Today more than ever, the nation, everyone in Honduras </p><p>should be united because together we can overcome obstacles </p><p>and only together will everything be all right. </p><p> </p><p>Good night. </p><p> </p><p>End text of informal Embassy translation of President </p><p>Maduro\'s speech. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment:  Post is disappointed to note that unlike </p><p>his March 18 statement in support of U.S. policy on Iraq </p><p>(reftel), Maduro made no mention in his speech of the fact </p><p>that the GOH is supporting U.S. policy on Iraq.  Whether </p><p>deliberate or unintentional, the result is that Maduro may </p><p>not be seen as forcefully backing U.S. policy, after several </p><p>GOH statements of support in recent days.  While Post notes </p><p>that Iraq has yet to become a major issue in Honduras, </p><p>several opposition Liberal Party congressmen have spoken out </p><p>against the war, and a sizeable demonstration against U.S. </p><p>policy by various organizations is planned for Monday, March </p><p>24 outside the Embassy.  Post will continue to urge the GOH </p><p>to use public statements to support U.S. policy on Iraq. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p></p></div>
