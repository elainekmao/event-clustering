<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001408 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, ASEC, PGOV, PHUM, NP, Maoist Insurgency, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: GROWING NEPAL-INDIA COOPERATION AGAINST MAOISTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 1407 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 1314 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The recent arrest of four Nepali Maoists in </p><p>New Delhi and their immediate extradition to Nepal, confirmed </p><p>by the Indian Embassy here, is one of many signs of growing </p><p>Nepal-India cooperation on efforts against the Maoist </p><p>insurgency in Nepal.  The four were members of a </p><p>Maoist-affiliated organization banned by the GOI as of July </p><p>1; their names were on a list provided by Nepal.  The Indian </p><p>Embassy has indicated that they wish to conclude an </p><p>extradition treaty with Nepal at an early date.  India has </p><p>reportedly stepped up security along the border between the </p><p>two countries, and, at Nepal\'s request, agreed to conduct </p><p>joint border patrols.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Arrested as Nepal-India Cooperation Grows </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Indian Embassy confirmed on July 18 that four </p><p>Maoists arrested by police in New Delhi had been handed over </p><p>to Nepal.  The four were arrested in the Indian capital July </p><p>11 and immediately passed to Uttar Pradesh police, who turned </p><p>them over to their Nepalese counterparts at the border the </p><p>same day, First Secretary V.V. Rao told us.  This incident </p><p>received substantial media play in Nepal\'s press, as have </p><p>other recent actions suggestive of greater bilateral </p><p>cooperation directed against Nepal\'s Maoist insurgents.  The </p><p>extradition of the four also won praise from Nepal\'s Foreign </p><p>Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>Members of Group Recently Banned at Nepal\'s Request </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The four, all members of the Akhil Bharat Nepali Ekta </p><p>Samaj (ABNES, or All-India Nepali Unity Society), a political </p><p>front of Nepal\'s Maoist party, were arrested at a political </p><p>meeting in New Delhi.  One, Partha Chhetri, a.k.a. Ram Karki, </p><p>reportedly played a leading role in the Maoists\' public </p><p>relations efforts.  Another, Maheshwor Dahal, is reportedly </p><p>the son of a Maoist leader named Iswori Dahal, a member of </p><p>the Central Committee.  Nepal\'s press has highlighted India\'s </p><p>July 1 announcement of the ban of ABNES.  The Indian Embassy </p><p>confirmed that the organization was banned at the GON\'s </p><p>request. </p><p> </p><p>India Acts on Nepal\'s Lists, Seeks Extradition Treaty </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In arresting the four, India was acting on a list of </p><p>Maoists provided by Nepal, Rao said.  India would continue to </p><p>act on information it receives from Nepal, and moreover would </p><p>detain and deport any other Maoists who came to their </p><p>attention.  Rao added that the recent visit of Nepal\'s King </p><p>Gyanendra to India (Ref B) had given new impetus to a </p><p>long-standing effort to reach agreement on an extradition </p><p>treaty between the two countries.  India hoped a deal could </p><p>be struck "as soon as possible," Rao stated, and the issue </p><p>would likely be taken up during an expected visit to Nepal by </p><p>new Indian External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha in the </p><p>coming weeks.  (Note:  Nepal\'s Chief Secretary also has </p><p>commented on preparations to conclude a Nepal-India </p><p>extradition treaty.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Stay Order Came Too Late </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Asked about media reports relating that the High Court </p><p>in Delhi had ordered the GOI to halt the extradition of the </p><p>four, Rao explained that a stay order had been issued to </p><p>prevent their repatriation but only after they had already </p><p>been turned over to Nepal police.  Because it was not a </p><p>directive, the stay order would not apply to future cases of </p><p>Nepalis arrested in India, Rao asserted. </p><p> </p><p>Border Patrols Stepped Up, Also at Nepal\'s Urging </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Responding to another recent request from Nepal, India </p><p>has agreed to conduct joint border patrols, Rao maintained. </p><p>Additionally, India has employed additional manpower to </p><p>regulate movement across the Nepal-India border.  The volume </p><p>of movement across the open border made it difficult to </p><p>monitor everyone, but India was working on modalities to step </p><p>up monitoring.  In addition to the police, customs and </p><p>immigration officers who had always manned the borders, India </p><p>had added "special security forces" to monitor the frontier, </p><p>Rao concluded. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Increased cooperation between Nepal and India on </p><p>counter-insurgency measures is a welcome sign, and recent </p><p>Maoist statements (Ref A) indicate that the insurgents have </p><p>already begun to feel the pinch.  Post believes that India </p><p>should be encouraged, whenever and wherever possible, to </p><p>continue to make life difficult for the Maoists.  The Indian </p><p>Embassy to Nepal has welcomed our interest in their efforts </p><p>to date. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
