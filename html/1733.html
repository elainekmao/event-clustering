IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ACCORDING TO SEVERAL INDEPENDENT AND RELIABLE </p><p>SOURCES, ZIMBABWE NATIONAL LIBERATION WAR VETERANS\' </p><p>ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN AND ZANU-PF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT </p><p>CHENJERAI "HITLER" HUNZVI DIED IN HOSPITAL ON THE </p><p>AFTERNOON OF JUNE 3.  AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON OFFICIAL </p><p>BROADCAST MEDIA EARLY ON THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 4 </p><p>CONFIRMED HIS DEATH.  HUNZVI HAD BEEN READMITTED TO A </p><p>HARARE HOSPITAL LATE LAST WEEK SHORTLY AFTER BEING </p><p>RELEASED FROM A BULAWAYO HOSPITAL (REFTEL).  HOSPITAL </p><p>SOURCES CONTINUED TO TELL THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" </p><p>LATE ON JUNE 3 THAT HUNZVI WAS STILL ON LIFE SUPPORT. </p><p>ALTHOUGH PRESS REPORTS SPECULATED THAT HUNZVI WAS ILL </p><p>WITH CEREBRAL MALARIA, IT HAD BEEN AN OPEN SECRET THAT </p><p>HE LONG SUFFERED FROM HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: WITH A 24-HOUR DELAY IN THE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS DEATH, GOZ OFFICIALS APPEARED TO BE </p><p>TRYING TO BUY TIME IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE </p><p>RAMIFICATIONS OF HUNZVI\'S PASSING.  THE GOZ LIKELY </p><p>WANTED TO WAIT FOR PRESIDENT MUGABE TO RETURN FROM ASIA </p><p>ON JUNE 3 BEFORE MAKING THE ANNOUNCEMENT.  SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA CANCELLED WITH LITTLE </p><p>PRIOR NOTICE A JUNE 4 MEETING WITH CHARGE.  WE SUSPECT </p><p>THAT HE AND OTHER ZANU-PF POLITBURO MEMBERS ARE HUDDLED </p><p>TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF HUNZVI\'S DEATH ON THE RULING </p><p>PARTY\'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND TO COME UP WITH A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01784  041306Z </p><p>SUCCESSOR FOR THE GOZ\'S CHIEF TERRORIZER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: HUNZVI\'S DEPARTURE FROM THE </p><p>SCENE IS NOT LIKELY TO END THE BITTER DIVISIONS THAT </p><p>HAVE WRACKED THE WAR VETERANS\' ASSOCIATION.  ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>RISING STAR AND HARARE WAR VETERANS LEADER JOSEPH </p><p>CHINOTIMBA WILL EVENTUALLY COME INTO CONFLICT WITH </p><p>HUNZVI\'S OLD RIVAL ENDY MHLANGA, THE ASSOCIATION\'S </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL.  ALTHOUGH MUGABE HAS DONE LITTLE IN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE PAST TO CURB THE ASSOCIATION\'S INTERNAL STRIFE AS A </p><p>WAY TO KEEP HUNZVI IN CHECK, HE WILL WANT TO MINIMIZE </p><p>RIVALRIES NOW TO ENSURE THAT THE WAR VETERANS DO NOT </p><p>LOSE THEIR WAY AND CEASE TO FUNCTION AS THE RULING </p><p>PARTY\'S SHOCK TROOPS.  MUGABE WILL WANT TO REASSURE </p><p>HUNZVI\'S ERSTWHILE PROTEGES THAT THEY WILL BE WELL </p><p>LOOKED AFTER AND THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN </p><p>INTEGRAL PART OF THE PRESIDENT\'S RE-ELECTION STRATEGY. </p><p>THE LAST THING MUGABE WANTS TO SEE NOW IS SO-CALLED WAR </p><p>VETERANS MELTING AWAY FROM THE OCCUPIED FARMS.
