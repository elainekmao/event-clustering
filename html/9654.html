<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS TO MOVE FORWARD JULY </p><p>26, DESPITE CRITICISM </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 4189 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Despite a petition endorsed by the Islamic Action </p><p>front (IAF) and its allies in the Lower House of Parliament </p><p>to delay municipal elections and review the electoral laws, </p><p>the government has decided to move forward with the process </p><p>on Saturday, July 26.  In Amman, low voter turn-out is </p><p>expected and minimal enthusiasm is indicated by the dearth of </p><p>campaign materials (i.e. posters, leaflets) in all districts. </p><p> END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>LOCAL ELECTIONS GOING AHEAD </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PolCouns and Pol Intern met July 22 with Minister of </p><p>Municipal and Rural Affairs Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat to discuss </p><p>Jordan\'s municipal elections.  A total of 1,643 candidates </p><p>will run in 88 city, town, and village councils around the </p><p>country.  These numbers are down slightly from earlier </p><p>estimates of 1,760 candidates in 99 municipalities.  Members </p><p>of the remaining 11 of the Kingdom\'s municipalities have </p><p>already won uncontested, with the number of candidates </p><p>equaling the number of seats.  In a press conference on July </p><p>23, Tbeishat expected that more council seats will be won </p><p>uncontested with the withdrawal of more candidates. </p><p>Forty-six of the candidates are women. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MANY COUNCIL MEMBERS TO BE APPOINTED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  While 554 municipal council members are to be </p><p>elected July 26, the government will appoint 441 others and </p><p>all of the mayors (who will be chosen from either the elected </p><p>or appointed council members).  Tbeishat said that in each </p><p>district in which no woman is elected, at least one woman </p><p>will be appointed.  (Comment:  A visiting democracy promotion </p><p>expert told Pol Intern that the appointment of women first </p><p>took place in the 1999 municipal elections at the behest of </p><p>Princess Basma, sister of the late King Hussein and aunt of </p><p>the current monarch.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  After the elections, Tbeishat explained that the </p><p>government plans to see which strategic professions/areas of </p><p>expertise are underrepresented in each council and appoint </p><p>members accordingly.  "If there\'s no engineer, we\'ll appoint </p><p>an engineer.  If there\'s no doctor, we\'ll appoint a doctor." </p><p>Tbeishat also said that losing candidates would not be </p><p>included in the appointee selection pool.  The names of the </p><p>appointed members will be announced by the Prime Ministry </p><p>after the results of elected members are declared.  Putting </p><p>both appointed and elected members on municipal councils, </p><p>Tbeishat said, is meant to improve the services provided to </p><p>citizens.  The GOJ is concerned that elected members will not </p><p>have sufficient academic, professional, and technical </p><p>backgrounds to execute their responsibilities skillfully. </p><p>Tbeishat added rather defensively that the GOJ hoped to </p><p>return to a system of elections for all municipal council </p><p>seats "when we have achieved a good base of democracy." </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>ELECTION PROCEDURES </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  In the 1999 municipal elections, voter turn-out </p><p>exceeded one million.  However, officials estimate </p><p>participation this year will be a good 21 percent lower.  One </p><p>reasons, claims the government, is that voting rosters were </p><p>cleaned, with duplicate names deleted.  All citizens will be </p><p>required to present their national ID card to cast a ballot. </p><p>Polls will be open from 0700 until 1700, and, according to </p><p>law, officials supervising the electoral process can extend </p><p>voting by an extra four hours during the first day if less </p><p>that 51 percent of eligible voters participate.  If, after </p><p>the four hour extension, voter turn-out does not exceed 51 </p><p>percent, the elections can be extended for a second day </p><p>(Sunday) from 0700 until 1700.  The results will then be </p><p>finalized and officially announced, regardless of the number </p><p>of voters participating. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  More than 3,000 employees of the Municipal Affairs </p><p>and Interior Ministries will oversee the process, and the </p><p>country\'s twelve governors will be responsible for the </p><p>electoral process in their jurisdictions.  As with the </p><p>Parliamentary elections on June 17, a central operations room </p><p>will be functioning at the Ministry to update journalists on </p><p>developments.  The only substantive difference between these </p><p>elections and the Parliamentary elections appears to be the </p><p>registration process.  For the municipal elections, the GOJ </p><p>appointed a committee in each municipality to produce a </p><p>definitive list of residents of that community for the voter </p><p>poll.  It was through this process, Tbeishat explained, that </p><p>"duplicate" names were removed. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  This will be Jordan\'s first municipal elections </p><p>where half of all municipal council members are appointed by </p><p>the government, as has long been the case in greater Amman. </p><p>The change, introduced several months ago to the law </p><p>governing municipalities, has drawn severe criticism from </p><p>many parties -- particularly the IAF, which is boycotting all </p><p>polls outside Amman.  The IAF has publicly demanded popular </p><p>selection of council members and mayors (see ref).  The IAF\'s </p><p>decision to run only in Amman may reflect an assessment of </p><p>its comparative weakness outside the capital.  Said Tbeishat, </p><p>"What, there\'s only democracy in Amman and not in the </p><p>villages?!" </p><p> </p><p>8  (C)  News of and material for upcoming municipal elections </p><p>has been scarce in both Arabic and English, perhaps an </p><p>indication of the public\'s general non-interest in this </p><p>latest round of voting.  The protest of some MPs against </p><p>these elections will not strengthen the legitimacy of the </p><p>elections in the minds of many voters. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
