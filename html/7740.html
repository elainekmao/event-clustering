Ankara rejected the allegations for arm smuggling, </p><p>and reiterated that they were security guards responsible </p><p>for the security of the Turkish Aid convoy.  Ankara further </p><p>stated that the US headquarters in Erbil had been notified </p><p>about the convoy and the guards, in advance.  The incident </p><p>caused tension in Ankara, and US Ambassador Robert Pearson </p><p>conveyed US administration\'s apologies to MFA.  Moreover, US </p><p>General Colby Broadwater passed his regrets to his Turkish </p><p>counterparts.  Although, FM Gul stated that Turkish special </p><p>forces ensure the security for convoys carrying aid to Iraq </p><p>from Turkey, last week, a Red Crescent convoy was </p><p>accompanied by US troops instead of the Turkish special </p><p>forces.  This shows that Turkey has stepped back and had </p><p>left the responsibility to the Americans.  And the Turkish </p><p>troops accompany only the convoys carrying logistic needs of </p><p>Turkish troops in Northern Iraq.  According to "Hurriyet", </p><p>after the incident last week, US has asked the Peshmerge </p><p>militants to leave Mosul and Kirkuk, and this proves that </p><p>the US pays attention to Turkey\'s complaints about the </p><p>Peshmerge militants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FM Gul Visit to Syria: All papers and TV channels cover </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul\'s day trip to Syria yesterday. </p><p>"Milliyet" reports that Gul has offered to mediate between </p><p>the US and Syria to defuse the tensions between the two </p><p>countries.  The Damascus administration gave Gul the green </p><p>light to mediate for them, and he has received a warm </p><p>welcome from Syria.  "Milliyet" notes that Turkey and Syria </p><p>have different views about the future of Iraq.  Syrian FM </p><p>Shara  addressed the coalition forces in Iraq as occupiers </p><p>and wanted them to leave Iraq immediately.  However, FM Gul, </p><p>in reply to this statement, said that this would lead to </p><p>chaos in the region, and Turkey wanted a broad- based, </p><p>democratic government in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC meeting:  All papers report that all eyes - including </p><p>the market\'s - were turned to today\'s NSC meeting. </p><p>"Milliyet" reports that the government will face a test at </p><p>today\'s meeting.  Chief of General Staff General Hilmi Ozkok </p><p>held a meeting with army officials yesterday evening and </p><p>agreed to warn the AKP government to avoid policies </p><p>encouraging fundamentalism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) US policy for the post Saddam era </p><p>b) SARS epidemic </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The new type of war" </p><p>Hadi Uluengin commented in mass appeal Hurriyet (4/30): "A </p><p>new type of war began as of September 11, 2001, and the US </p><p>is going to pursue this war according to its own ethical </p><p>parameters.  It may sound a bit odd, but the fact of the </p><p>matter is that the US has no imperialist spirit as evidenced </p><p>in its history.  Historically, imperialism has never taken </p><p>root in the US.  On the contrary, America has always been </p><p>the champion of anti-colonialism. . Yet this policy shifted </p><p>a little bit as of the late 19th century due to US policies </p><p>in Cuba, Haiti, and the Philippines, which can be described </p><p>as a kind of imperialism.  However, overall US policy has </p><p>generally been defined as `isolationist\' as well as `anti- </p><p>colonial.\'  The so-called American imperialism was really </p><p>the result of US `realpolitik\' forced on the Americans by </p><p>the Cold War.  Thus, the argument about US imperialism is </p><p>inappropriate in the case of Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is Turkey going to wait until SARS hits the country?" </p><p>Hakki Devrim noted in liberal-intellectual Radikal (4/30): </p><p>"Turkey is preoccupied with its internal political debates </p><p>and angst, and all eyes are watching the upcoming National </p><p>Security Council meeting to see the nature of the tiff </p><p>between ruling politicians and the military over the </p><p>secularism issue.  However, there is a very important issue </p><p>that we tend to ignore.  Scientists are warning us about the </p><p>SARS epidemic, which might infect up to 1 billion human </p><p>beings around the globe over the next year.  . Now is the </p><p>very time to categorize the countries around the world, </p><p>noting those that are taking sensible and immediate </p><p>precautions, and the others which are avoiding the reality. </p><p>. Observing press coverage as well as reactions from health </p><p>specialists, I am not optimistic about Turkey\'s record. </p><p>There is no sign of panic or even worry.  Are we going to </p><p>take action only after the epidemic hits the nation?  I </p><p>wonder." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
