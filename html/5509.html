Summary: The Embassy\'s Economic/Commercial section </p><p>recently convened a discussion group of 25 lower-grade </p><p>national employees to help us assess the impact of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s economic crisis on ordinary citizens. </p><p>Employees described ever-worsening conditions in </p><p>transport, health, education, housing and nutrition. </p><p>Tragically, the world\'s fastest declining economy </p><p>seems to be making them and their countrymen poorer </p><p>each day. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. We restricted the meeting to national employees </p><p>grades FSN 6 and lower, aiming to learn how the </p><p>downward spiral is affecting average Zimbabweans. </p><p>Most earn US$150-400 per month, exceeding the salaries </p><p>of counterparts outside the Embassy due to U.S. dollar </p><p>indexing.  We summarize the main discussion topics </p><p>below: </p><p> </p><p>Transport </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>3. As we pointed out (ref), transport between the </p><p>high-density suburbs and downtown Harare has become an </p><p>ordeal.  Some employees spend 2-3 hours commuting each </p><p>way.  They criticize an increasingly common practice </p><p>of van operators extorting high fees from desperate </p><p>passengers.  Commuter vans raise fares 5-fold when it </p><p>rains.  Employees are forced to pay one bribe to move </p><p>to the head of the line, then a second bribe to board </p><p>the van.  Sometimes van operators order people to </p><p>disembark at the first stop in town or in the suburbs, </p><p>so they can pick-up new passengers. </p><p> </p><p>4. Employees who drive now rarely secure fuel at the </p><p>heavily-subsidized official price.  When a worker buys </p><p>fuel from the Embassy warehouse at the international </p><p>market price, he spends 6-7 times as much on fuel as </p><p>he is accustomed to spend on the local economy. </p><p> </p><p>Health-Care </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5. Quality of hospitals is sinking.  Many have nearly </p><p>no drugs.  Meanwhile, doctors, nurses and other health </p><p>professionals are emigrating and hence in short </p><p>supply.  Patients must pay upfront for prescription </p><p>medication, then apply to their private insurer for </p><p>reimbursement. However, since the insurance company </p><p>can take 4 months to process claims, Zimbabwe\'s high </p><p>inflation eats a large chunk of the money they </p><p>eventually receive. </p><p> </p><p>Education </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6. Traditionally high education standards are </p><p>similarly eroding.  One employee complained that </p><p>public school teachers -- who earn US$ 20-30/month -- </p><p>are so unmotivated that parents must pick up the slack </p><p>and educate children in the evening.  This was unheard </p><p>of just a few years ago.  An employee said his kid </p><p>receives little attention in a class of 45 pupils, </p><p>while another said he knows teachers who must oversee </p><p>several grades at the same time.  Still another caught </p><p>his child\'s teacher requesting that students bring </p><p>supplies from home that were never used in class. </p><p>Apparently, the teacher sought to supplement his pay </p><p>by unloading the supplies on the black market. </p><p> </p><p>7. School fees are increasing.  One employee told of a </p><p>5-fold increase since last year.  Schools have stopped </p><p>supplying stationery and books, which parents can only </p><p>obtain on the black market.  For example, a bookstore </p><p>clerk could not sell an employee her daughter\'s </p><p>required textbook for the controlled price.  Instead, </p><p>the clerk directed her to a street-corner operator who </p><p>demanded triple the GOZ\'s mandated price. </p><p> </p><p>Food </p><p>---- </p><p>8. Employees complained that it is impossible to </p><p>budget for food -- which swallows most of their income </p><p>- since it is on </p><p>ly available at widely-fluctuating </p><p>black market rates.  Many supermarkets engage in the </p><p>illegal practice of "conditional selling," whereby </p><p>they only offer staples like milk and bread to </p><p>customers who pay a bribe or purchase a large amount </p><p>of groceries. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>9. Like nearly everyone here, employees are struck, </p><p>even dumbfounded, by the speed of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>impoverishment.  Although Embassy employees have </p><p>gained considerably over their counterparts due to </p><p>salary dollarization, many Zimbabweans who owned cars </p><p>and took middle-class vacations just 2 years ago </p><p>barely able to feed and clothe their families today. </p><p>They watch an historically excellent infrastructure </p><p>crumble and have little choice but to bribe, cheat and </p><p>extort their way to basic services.  Some say they </p><p>have given up hobbies, since they devote their non- </p><p>working hours to commuting and lining up for food, </p><p>fuel or other price-controlled items. Worst of all, </p><p>perhaps, is that the GOZ\'s economic policies are </p><p>tearing apart society\'s moral tapestry, forcing </p><p>formerly law-abiding firms and individuals into </p><p>black market dealings.  Without a doubt, Zimbabwe is </p><p>becoming a very different place. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
