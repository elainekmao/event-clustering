<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001590 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DRL/PHD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, PREL, PHUM, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: Nepal\'s Forthcoming Elections: What the U.S. Can </p><p>Do to Help </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) Kathmandu 1546, B) Kathmandu 1348 </p><p> </p><p>1. Nepal is preparing to hold national elections beginning </p><p>November 13, followed by local elections sometime around </p><p>April, 2003.  The ongoing violent Maoist insurgency will </p><p>complicate security arrangements and increase expenditures </p><p>at a time when economic conditions are deteriorating. </p><p>Moreover, recent natural calamities resulting from </p><p>unusually heavy monsoon rains have worsened the resource </p><p>crunch.  Without significant foreign support, Nepal will </p><p>not be able to hold the elections, let alone create an </p><p>environment where the results will be considered free, </p><p>fair and legitimate by the electorate. </p><p> </p><p>2. Ref A related the UN\'s plans for election assistance </p><p>for the November Parliamentary elections and passed on its </p><p>request for aid and its call for donor nations to sponsor </p><p>election observers.  Ref B related the National Election </p><p>Commission\'s request for material assistance. </p><p>Additionally, Post has been contacted by a number of NGOs </p><p>with proposals for election assistance.  Brief summaries </p><p>are included at paragraph 4.  We have ranked in priority </p><p>order those the Embassy considers the most worth funding. </p><p>These programs are ready to go, and lack only the </p><p>resources to implement them.  The Embassy strongly urges </p><p>that the Department fund these programs.  Most of these </p><p>programs target the national elections, and additional </p><p>resources should be added to provide similar support for </p><p>the local elections in the Spring. </p><p> </p><p>3. Proposals A, B and C are expansions of existing </p><p>programs that USAID or State has already funded.  If </p><p>additional money were made available for these programs, </p><p>USAID could channel the funds to the relevant </p><p>organizations with minimal paperwork.  In order for USAID </p><p>to obligate funds this fiscal year to the proposed </p><p>programs, specific approved funding levels have to be </p><p>notified to Congress by September 3. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Proposals to support elections in Nepal: </p><p> </p><p>A. Local-level Public Meetings ($75,000) </p><p>The Asia Foundation (TAF) </p><p>USAID is already providing TAF $125,000 for this project. </p><p>An additional $75,000 would allow for two meetings per </p><p>constituency instead of one, and for the program to be </p><p>extended to twenty additional constituencies, for a total </p><p>of 170 instead of 150 of Nepal\'s total of 205 </p><p>constituencies. </p><p> </p><p>B. Voter Education ($255,000) </p><p>National Democratic Institute (NDI) </p><p>USAID is already providing NDI $125,000 for this project. </p><p>An additional $255,000 will allow additional voter </p><p>education materials to be provided in all of Nepal\'s 75 </p><p>districts, and for ten local NGOs to conduct village-level </p><p>campaigns using NDI materials. </p><p> </p><p>C. Expansion of Electoral Observer Program  (No Estimate) </p><p>Consortium for Elections and Political Process </p><p>Strengthening (CEPPS) </p><p>Post has tagged $164,000 of FY 2002 ESF monies for </p><p>international, regional or local observers funded through </p><p>USAID\'s CEPPS program.  Additional funding would allow for </p><p>more election observers.  Post notes that it is still </p><p>awaiting Department approval of its requested ESF funding </p><p>for FY 2002. </p><p> </p><p>D. Regional International Observers (94,000) </p><p>TAF, through the Bangkok-based Asian Network for Free </p><p>Elections (ANFREL), would provide thirty observers from </p><p>South, Southeast and East Asia.  [Note:  As with D, E and </p><p>F, below, cost includes $38,000 for an International </p><p>Elections Consultant (IEC).  Were more than one of these </p><p>four programs to be funded, the IEC cost could be shared </p><p>among them.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>E. Local Long-term International Observers ($255,000) </p><p>TAF would train and deploy twenty-five locally-based </p><p>expatriates as observers over the course of the elections, </p><p>estimated at six weeks.  [Note:  The International </p><p>Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) and the Carter </p><p>Center have also expressed interest in sending </p><p>international observers, but have not yet offered an </p><p>estimate of projected expenses.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>F. Expatriate Election-day Observers ($46,000) </p><p>TAF would organize and deploy volunteer expatriate </p><p>observers on election day only. </p><p> </p><p>G. Election Monitoring ($355,000) </p><p>NDI would support a total of about 25 individuals, </p><p>including long-term, short-term and post-election </p><p>monitors, and one-day training workshops on poll </p><p>monitoring for political parties and NGOs.  [Note:  Funds </p><p>in support of this program could be channeled through </p><p>USAID\'s central electoral support project (CEPPF).  End </p><p>Note.] </p><p> </p><p>H. Regional Election Reporting ($30,000) </p><p>TAF would support the Center for Investigative Journalism </p><p>in Nepal to establish a special cell for election </p><p>coverage. </p><p> </p><p>5. It is clearly in the USG interest to support the </p><p>holding of free and fair elections at this critical period </p><p>of Nepal\'s democratic development.  Both domestic and </p><p>international resources committed to date are inadequate </p><p>to meet the requirements of two major sets of elections </p><p>within six months.  Post urges immediate consideration of </p><p>additional funding to enable the USG to demonstrate its </p><p>support for Nepal\'s fledgling democracy. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
