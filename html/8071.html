End summary. </p><p> </p><p>SECOND ROUND OF TALKS HELD </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The second round of peace talks between negotiators for </p><p>the GON and Maoists was held on May 9 (Reftel).  Krishna </p><p>Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman, told reporters at the </p><p>conclusion of the talks that they had taken "a positive </p><p>turn," while Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of Physical </p><p>Planning and Works and government negotiating team member, </p><p>termed them a "historic success."  Maoist representatives </p><p>used the second round to present additional demands, while </p><p>the GON still has not presented its agenda. Minister Pun </p><p>said the GON\'s agenda would be discussed only after the </p><p>Maoists\' demands were sorted out.  (Comment:  Considering </p><p>the Maoist penchant for seemingly endless demands, it is </p><p>difficult to say when the GON\'s agenda will surface.)  The </p><p>second round concluded with the GON, yet again, conceding to </p><p>several more Maoist demands, apparently including limiting </p><p>the movement of the army to within a three-mile radius of </p><p>their barracks, and agreeing to release three Central </p><p>Committee Members still imprisoned.  (Note:  The Maoists had </p><p>demanded the release of five of their Central Committee </p><p>Members as a pre-condition for peace talks.  The GON has </p><p>already released two.  End Note). No date has been set for </p><p>the next round. </p><p> </p><p>SUPPORT AND SKEPTICISM FOR PEACE TALKS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  With the completion of the second round of talks, </p><p>members of the international community have become more </p><p>vocal in expressing hope and support for a peaceful </p><p>solution.  Ingrid Ofstad, Ambassador of Norway to Nepal, </p><p>expressed hope that some of Nepal\'s social and economic </p><p>problems could be resolved now that the peace talks appeared </p><p>to be progressing.  Asko Luukkhainen, Charge d\'Affairs of </p><p>the Embassy of Finland, said he was confident that the peace </p><p>talks would be a success, declaring that his government </p><p>"welcomed the negotiations." </p><p> </p><p>4.  Official peace talk facilitators, however, apparently do </p><p>not share this optimism.  Padma Ratna Tuladhar and Daman </p><p>Nath Dhungana, both facilitators in the current talks as </p><p>well as the failed talks in 2001, reportedly have expressed </p><p>concern over the lack of participation from political </p><p>parties, civil society and human rights activists.  Tuladhar </p><p>and Dhungana, speaking at a human rights symposium on May </p><p>10, cautioned that the talks could flounder. </p><p> </p><p>RNA REJECTS RESTRICTIONS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  Controversy has surrounded the supposed deal made </p><p>between the GON and the Maoists to limit the movement of the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army (RNA).  Amidst strong protests from the </p><p>RNA, some government officials have denied that a deal was </p><p>struck, and members of the RNA have said they will not </p><p>accept the deal.  Colonel Deepak Gurung, RNA spokesman, said </p><p>on May 14 that the army will continue patrolling as usual. </p><p>Gurung reiterated that the Maoists still pose a threat to </p><p>security, and that the RNA would not restrict itself to a </p><p>three-mile radius until it recovered all of the looted </p><p>weapons from the insurgents.  Gurung also told the DCM that </p><p>he had not received any official word from the GON on the </p><p>restrictions. </p><p> </p><p>6.  According to local press reports, senior officers in the </p><p>RNA have also refused to acknowledge the deal made between </p><p>the GON and the Maoists, and have strongly condemned the </p><p>GON\'s decision.  A local publication quoted an unnamed army </p><p>official on May 11 as saying that the decision should have </p><p>been made by the Defense Council (comprised of the Prime </p><p>Minister, Defense Minister and Chief of the Army) and not by </p><p>"a few ministers."   Other top officers were quoted as </p><p>saying the army will never accept the deal, declaring that </p><p>it jeopardizes national security.  Dev Gurung, a politburo </p><p>member of the Maoists, however, said the RNA was simply </p><p>trying to establish military rule.  Minister Pun, in </p><p>response to press inquiries on May 11 about the </p><p>restrictions, was quick to point out that it would take time </p><p>to implement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FORMER CHILD SOLDIERS SPEAK OUT AS MAOIST </p><p>LEADER DENIES RECRUITING CHILDREN </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Partha Chettri, a Maoist leader recently released from </p><p>prison, dismissed allegations of child recruitment by the </p><p>Maoists as "war propaganda."  His denials directly contrast </p><p>with the admissions made by Maoist cadres in the eastern </p><p>district of Panchthar, who claim that they recruited youths </p><p>as recently as May 14 to join militant ranks.  Press reports </p><p>from the district quoted a Maoist leader as saying that </p><p>seventeen youths were taken from their families for the </p><p>purpose of serving in the "People\'s War."  Chettri\'s </p><p>denials, issued on May 11, also come at a time when many </p><p>child soldiers who had been underground are returning home. </p><p>A vernacular publication, which conducted interviews with </p><p>former child soldiers from the far-western district of </p><p>Kalikot, reports that that district alone had three hundred </p><p>child soldiers, some of whom were as young as eight years, </p><p>and who reportedly were ready to resume fighting if peace </p><p>talks fail.  A ten-year-old child who joined the Maoist </p><p>insurgency two years ago told the publication that there </p><p>were "hundreds of children like me." Although many of them </p><p>spoke of being willing to return to the jungle if the peace </p><p>talks failed, most said they had endured "unimaginable </p><p>hardships" as soldiers, and hoped that they would never have </p><p>to pick up a gun again. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST VIOLATIONS RAMPANT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  A report released on May 9 that was compiled by local </p><p>district security committees documents widespread and </p><p>rampant ceasefire violations by Maoists.  According to the </p><p>report, Maoist violations include extortion; holding mass </p><p>meetings while armed; abduction of civilians, including </p><p>women and children; forcing families to attend public </p><p>gatherings; assault; disruption of infrastructure </p><p>reconstruction projects and postal operations; and extorting </p><p>money from tourists. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Maoists reportedly have stepped up their recruitment in </p><p>the far-western district of Accham, along with increased </p><p>extortion and looting of money and food.  The insurgents </p><p>have also reportedly locked up the Village Development </p><p>Committee (VDC) offices in Bardiya and Salyan Districts, </p><p>causing government workers to shut down operations and flee. </p><p>Maoists have also carried out looting sprees in Bardiya, </p><p>stealing wheat, lentils and other cash crops that were being </p><p>transported after harvest.  Many of the villagers have fled </p><p>the region as a result. In Kailali District the insurgents </p><p>reportedly threatened to break the hands and legs of people </p><p>who interfered with their looting of forestry offices. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Maoists continue to target innocent civilians, </p><p>abducting thirteen people from various districts. The </p><p>insurgents claim some of the victims were taken on suspicion </p><p>of stealing, but no reason was given for the kidnapping of </p><p>others, including a district secretary for the Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML). </p><p> </p><p>11.  Extortion campaigns by the Maoists are not limited to </p><p>locals.  The Nepal Association of Rafting Agents (NARA) </p><p>claims that the insurgents still demand money from tourists </p><p>and agents who want to raft on rivers in areas where Maoists </p><p>operate.  Mahendra Singh Thapa, President of NARA, said the </p><p>exactions have continued despite the ceasefire, with </p><p>tourists being forced to pay a twenty-dollar "donation" to </p><p>the insurgents.  The rafting industry has been especially </p><p>hard hit by the Maoist insurgency, with the number of </p><p>rafting agencies dwindling from seventy to thirty-six. </p><p> </p><p>RNA HOLDS HEALTH CAMPS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Thousands of people defied a Maoist ban to attend free </p><p>health camps set up by the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) in some of </p><p>the hardest hit mid-western districts.  Over ten thousand </p><p>people reportedly received medical assistance in the </p><p>districts of Dang, Salyan, Rukum and Rolpa.  Maoists in </p><p>those regions reportedly ordered villagers not to attend the </p><p>camps, proclaiming them to be in violation of the ceasefire. </p><p>The Insurgents also threatened villagers on their way to the </p><p>camps, and cut off the drinking water supply to health camps </p><p>in Salyan District.  The RNA says it has no plans to </p><p>discontinue the health camps, and is organizing similar </p><p>programs in other remote districts of the mid- and far- </p><p>western regions. </p><p> </p><p>ANNISU-R LOCKS ACCOUNTING OFFICES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  The All Nepal National Independent Students\' Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist affiliated student </p><p>wing, carried out their threat to lock the accounting </p><p>offices of various private schools.  The militant students </p><p>began the lockouts on May 9 as a protest against </p><p>"unreasonable" fees charged by private institutions.  The </p><p>lockouts continued with the shutdown of two accounting </p><p>offices at schools in Bara District on May 12.  While </p><p>classes were not disrupted, the students warned that they </p><p>would impose indefinite strikes on the schools if their </p><p>concerns were not taken seriously.  Officials at the Bara </p><p>schools said they were forced to raise fees because money </p><p>provided by the GON was insufficient. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
