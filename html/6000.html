O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: What is Zimbabwe\'s new exchange rate? </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 347 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Businessmen in Zimbabwe have spent the </p><p>past week trying to figure out how the GOZ\'s new export </p><p>support mechanism will work.  Although different </p><p>interpretations abound, two cabinet officials apparently </p><p>reassured a group of prominent CEOs yesterday that </p><p>exporters would enjoy a significant devaluation.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Conflicting Interpretations </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) In reftel, we explained that exporters may </p><p>exchange 50 percent of earnings at 800:1.  Then we </p><p>offered two scenarios for the other 50 percent: exchange </p><p>at the official rate of 55:1 (1st option) or gain access </p><p>to it in foreign currency -- presently, an effective </p><p>market rate of 1420:1 (2nd option).  On the other hand, </p><p>some locals have been told the GOZ means to offer </p><p>exporters a flat rate of 800:1 for their entire revenue </p><p>(3rd option).  A parallel but equally important debate </p><p>centers on whether importers may access U.S. dollars at </p><p>800:1.  Businessmen have complained to us that neither </p><p>the Finance Ministry nor Reserve Bank has been willing to </p><p>clarify the policy.  The businessmen can only wait for </p><p>the law\'s official printed version, which may appear in </p><p>the government gazette within a few days.  Given that </p><p>companies are shutting down or cutting back operations at </p><p>an alarming pace, a clear enunciation of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>exchange rate is crucial. </p><p> </p><p>The Latest Word from Govt </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) The Finance Director of a large corporation told </p><p>us that his and several other CEOs met yesterday </p><p>afternoon with Vice President Simon Muzenda and </p><p>Information Minister Jonathan Moyo to plead for </p><p>clarification.  They were apparently told the GOZ has </p><p>"nearly" decided on a hybrid of the second and third </p><p>options described above.  Exporters must exchange the </p><p>first 50 percent of revenue at 800:1.  They then deposit </p><p>the second 50 percent in the Reserve Bank and apply for </p><p>permission to use it for qualified imports, permitting -- </p><p>if granted -- an effective rate of 1420:1 currently on </p><p>the parallel market).  The blend rate would be over </p><p>1100:1.  If exporters are unsuccessful convincing the GOZ </p><p>to allow them access to the second 50 percent held in </p><p>forex within 60 days, they also receive the other 50 </p><p>percent at 800:1. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) If true, this is not the worst of scenarios. </p><p>Companies tell us 800:1 is the minimum effective rate </p><p>needed to restart exports.  However, those exporters </p><p>still in operation have grown accustomed to sheltering </p><p>earnings offshore and enjoying a market rate of 1400 or </p><p>higher.  Since the GOZ\'s export-unfriendly budget </p><p>statement in November, in fact, indigenous banks like CBZ </p><p>have found a new niche offering tax-evasion assistance </p><p>for exporters.  The GOZ will have a difficult job drawing </p><p>them back to the fold. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
