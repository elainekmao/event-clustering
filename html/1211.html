END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>RICE RESEARCHERS HELP SKEPTICAL FARMERS, BENEFIT EXPORTERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. CONGEN STAFF MET WITH DR. BUI CHI BUU OF THE CUU LONG </p><p>RICE RESEARCH INSTITUTE (CLRRI), STARTED IN 1977 WITH </p><p>BILATERAL AID FROM INDIA.  37 OUT OF 110 STAFF SCIENTISTS </p><p>HAVE ADVANCED DEGREES; CURRENTLY, THREE POSTDOCTORAL </p><p>STUDENTS ARE AT PURDUE, TEXAS TECH, AND TEXAS A&M.  CLRRI </p><p>MISSION OBJECTIVES ARE: 1) TO STUDY RICE AND RICE-BASED </p><p>AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS IN THE DELTA, WHICH PRODUCES 60 </p><p>PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S RICE AND 80 PERCENT OF ITS RICE </p><p>EXPORTS; 2) TO TRAIN EXTENSION WORKERS AND OTHER SKILLED </p><p>WORKERS FOR THE DELTA; AND 3) TO FOSTER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COLLABORATION.  ADMINISTRATIVELY, CLRRI IS UNDER THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT (MARD). </p><p>CLRRI\'S ANNUAL BUDGET IS APPROXIMATELY USD 500,000, </p><p>SUPPLEMENTED BY CONTRACT RESEARCH.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>MEDIA, PROFITS MADE PRODUCING RICE SEEDLINGS ON CLRRI LAND </p><p>ARE USED TO AUGMENT STAFF SALARIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN 1999 THE MEKONG DELTA PRODUCED 16.5 MILLION METRIC </p><p>TONS OF RICE AND HAD AN AVERAGE YIELD OF 4.8 TONS PER </p><p>HECTACRE.  RICE IS GROWN ON 1.7 MILLION HECTARES OF DELTA </p><p>LAND, SOMEWHAT LESS THAN 15 YEARS AGO.  HOWEVER, </p><p>PRODUCTION HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE THE LATE 1970\'S DUE </p><p>TO IMPROVED MULTIPLE CROPPING AND MORE SUITABLE RICE </p><p>VARIETIES, WITH CLRRI PLAYING A KEY ROLE CREATING NEW </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  01 OF 07  110409Z </p><p>VARIETIES AND TESTING OTHERS.  MOST FARMERS IN THE DELTA </p><p>GROW TWO RICE CROPS, THE MAIN SUMMER-AUTUMN CROP (JUNE TO </p><p>SEPTEMBER) AND THE WINTER-SPRING CROP (NOVEMBER TO </p><p>FEBRUARY).  SOME GROW A THIRD, SPRING-SUMMER CROP (MARCH </p><p>TO JUNE), IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT IRRIGATION.  IN FACT, </p><p>GROWING SEASONS ARE ACUTALLY MORE COMPLICATED, ACCORDING </p><p>TO BUI, AND IT IS SOMETIMES POSSIBLE TO SEE PADDY IN ALL </p><p>GROWTH STAGES AT THE SAME TIME IN THE SAME AREA.  THE </p><p>INPUT COST PER KILOGRAM OF PADDY FOR THE WINTER/SPRING AND </p><p>SPRING/SUMMER CROPS IS VND 800-1,000 (USD 0.06-0.07). </p><p>INPUT COSTS FOR THE SUMMER/AUTUMN CROP OF VND 1,600-1,700 </p><p>(USD 0.11-0.12) ARE MUCH HIGHER, BUT SO ARE THE YIELDS. </p><p>BUI SAID CLRRI IN FACT RECOMMENDS PLANTING SOYBEANS </p><p>INSTEAD OF A THIRD RICE CROP TO MAINTAIN SOIL QUALITY, BUT </p><p>FARMERS DON\'T FOLLOW ITS ADVICE BECAUSE RICE PRICES ARE </p><p>NORMALLY MUCH HIGHER. </p><p> </p><p>4. CLRRI HAS SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED HIGH-YIELD VARIETIES. </p><p>HOWEVER, FARMERS TYPICALLY USE SEED FROM THE PREVIOUS CROP </p><p>FOR THE NEXT ONE, AT NO COST, WHICH RESULTS IN SEED </p><p>DEGENERATION.  CLRRI HAS ALSO FOCUSED ON LOWERING INPUT </p><p>COSTS, WHICH IN NOMINAL DONG TERMS HAVE DOUBLED OVER THE </p><p>LAST TEN YEARS.  IN 1999, IT ADAPTED LEAF CHARTS TO REDUCE </p><p>THE USE OF NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS AND DEVELOPED A RICE </p><p>SEEDER TO CUT SEED COSTS IN HALF OVER THE TRADITIONAL </p><p>BROADCASTING METHOD.  DESPITE CLRRI\'S SUCCESSES, BUI SAID </p><p>DELTA RICE FARMERS TREAT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS SKEPTICALLY, </p><p>AND IT WOULD TAKE TWO YEARS FOR THE LEAF CHARTS AND </p><p>SEEDERS TO CATCH ON.  BUI ALSO HOPED FOR THE SUCCESS OF A </p><p>DANISH-FUNDED PROJECT WHICH HAS HELPED INSTALL OVER 5,000 </p><p>SMALL RICE DRYERS IN CAN THO AND SOC TRANG PROVINCES. </p><p>ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF DELTA RICE FARMERS USE RICE DRIERS, </p><p>SINCE THE COSTS OF DRYERS ARE NOT SEEN TO BE WORTH THE </p><p>REDUCTION IN SPOILAGE AND INCREASED PRICE FOR HIGHER </p><p>QUALITY.   DELTA RICE FARMERS ONLY EARNED AN AVERAGE OF </p><p>USD 700 PER HOUSEHOLD IN 1999.  THE REAL BENEFICIARIES OF </p><p>CLRRI\'S WORK, SAID BUI, HAVE BEEN RICE EXPORTERS, WHO "DO </p><p>NOT INVEST IN ANYTHING." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01121  02 OF 07  110410Z </p><p>ELECTRICITY RE-SELLERS CHARGE ABOVE THE LEGAL LIMIT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>5. THE GVN HAS SET RURAL HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICITY PRICES </p><p>CHARGED BY ELECTRICITY OF VIETNAM (EVN) AT VND 500 (3.6 </p><p>CENTS) PER KILOWATT-HOUR (KWH) FOR THE FIRST 100 KWH PER </p><p>MONTH, RISING TO VND 1,397 (10.0 CENTS) FOR CONSUMPTION </p><p>OVER 300 KWH.  IN SEPTEMBER 1999 ONLY 77 PERCENT OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S RURAL DISTRICTS HAD ELECTRICITY.  ALTHOUGH EACH </p><p>OF CAN THO PROVINCE\'S SIX DISTRICTS AND CAN THO CITY HAVE </p><p>ELECTRICITY, AT THE END OF 1999 ONLY 68 PERCENT OF </p><p>HOUSEHOLDS WERE HOOKED UP.  CONGEN STAFF MET WITH DO HUU </p><p>TRONG, DIRECTOR OF THE TAN PHU COMMUNE EVN STATION IN </p><p>RURAL CHAU THANH DISTRICT.  EVN\'S GRID EXTENDS TO THE MAIN </p><p>VILLAGE IN ALL CHAU THANH\'S 13 COMMUNES, BUT NOT TO THE </p><p>NUMEROUS HAMLETS.  IN TAN PHU, CHAU THANH\'S MOST WELL-OFF </p><p>COMMUNE, THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE INVESTED IN TRANSFORMERS </p><p>AND DISTRIBUTION LINES, AND RE-SELLS ELECTRICITY BOUGHT </p><p>FROM EVN TO 3,000 HOUSEHOLDS AT AN AVERAGE OF VND 1,000 </p><p>(7.1 CENTS) PER KWH.  AN AUSTRALIAN INVESTOR HAS DONE A </p><p>FEASIBILITY STUDY TO SUPPLY FIVE TO SEVEN THOUSAND </p><p>HOUSEHOLDS IN ANOTHER COMMUNE IN CHAU THANH AT VND 1,100- </p><p>1,400 (7.9 CENTS TO 10 CENTS) PER KWH. </p><p> </p><p>6. RURAL EVN CUSTOMERS PAY A HOOK-UP CHARGE FROM VND </p><p>800,000 TO 1,200,000 (USD 57 TO USD 86) AND AN AVERAGE </p><p>RATE OF VND 360 (2.6 CENTS) PER KWH.  THE GVN HAS SET A </p><p>CEILING PRICE OF VND 700 (5.0 CENTS) PER KWH FOR RE- </p><p>SELLERS, WHOSE CUSTOMERS DO NOT PAY A HOOK-UP CHARGE.  IN </p><p>PRACTICE, HOWEVER, PRIVATE RE-SELLERS STRIKE AGREEMENTS </p><p>WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SELL AT HIGHER THAN THE LEGAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  02 OF 07  110410Z </p><p>RATE, AND SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES, SUCH AS IN </p><p>TAN PHU, ALSO SELL AT A HIGHER RATE.  A GVN SURVEY IN 1998 </p><p>SHOWED 39 PERCENT OF RURAL HOUSEHOLDS PAID MORE THAN THE </p><p>LEGAL RATE, WITH PRICES IN SOME LOCALITIES AS HIGH AS 15 </p><p>CENTS PER KWH.  TRONG ATTRIBUTED ALLOWING A HIGHER PRICE </p><p>TO "BAD MANAGEMENT."   IN FACT, EVN WAS TRYING TO GET TAN </p><p>PHU TO CUT ITS PRICE, HE SAID, BUT THE RISK WAS THAT THE </p><p>CABLES WOULD BE CUT INSTEAD.  TRONG ALSO SAID THE </p><p>AUSTRALIAN INVESTOR HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE CAN THO </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  AS ONE ARTICLE ON ELECTRICITY </p><p>DISTRIBUTION IN VIETNAM HAS PUT IT, "THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>CAUGHT IN THE USUAL SPOT BETWEEN THE ROCK OF NEEDING TO </p><p>IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE HARD PLACE OF HAVING NO </p><p>MONEY TO DO THE JOB." </p><p> </p><p>7. CONGEN STAFF SPOKE TO A TAN PHU CUSTOMER, WHO SAID </p><p>AFTER SHE STARTED RECEIVING ELECTRICITY IN 1990, BUSINESS </p><p>GOT BETTER AND LIFE BECAME MORE COMFORTABLE.  NOW, SHE CAN </p><p>PRODUCE TWO SETS OF CLOTHES PER DAY IN HER TAILOR SHOP, </p><p>OPENED A KARAOKE ROOM FOR CUSTOMERS, AND HAS ELECTRICAL </p><p>APPLIANCES SUCH AS A WASHING MACHINE, TELEVISION, </p><p>REFRIGERATOR, AND A RICE COOKER.  SHE SAID IN FACT, SHE </p><p>PAID THE RESELLER VND 800 (5.7 CENTS) PER KHW FOR </p><p>ELECTRICITY AND ANOTHER VND 600 (4.3 CENTS) PER KHW FOR </p><p>"MAINTENANCE."  SHE SAID SHE CAREFULLY MONITORED HER </p><p>ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; IF THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY WENT </p><p>UP, SHE\'D USE LESS, AND IF IT WENT DOWN, SHE\'D USE MORE. </p><p> </p><p>8. IN ANOTHER MODEL FOR RURAL ELECTRIFICATION BEYOND EVN\'S </p><p>GRID, 135 HOUSEHOLDS IN TAN PHU ORGANIZED AN ELECTRICITY </p><p>BUYING COOPERATIVE.  THEY BOUGHT THEIR OWN TRANSFORMER AND </p><p>EACH PAID VARYING AMOUNTS TO HOOK-UP DEPENDING ON THEIR </p><p>LOCATION.  INDIVIDUALS PAY AN AVERAGE OF VND 580 (4.1 </p><p>CENTS) PER KILOWATT HOUR.  THEIR ACTUAL BILL IS BASED ON </p><p>DISTANCE FROM THE GRID, NOT CONSUMPTION, SINCE THE </p><p>COOPERATIVE\'S CONSUMPTION IS METERED AS A GROUP.  IN A </p><p>VARIATION ON THIS MODEL, THE GROUP LEADER INVESTS TO HOOK </p><p>UP PRIVATE CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE COOPERATIVE.  THE </p><p>COOPERATIVE LEADER IN TAN PHU BELIEVED THAT PEOPLE IN CHAU </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01121  03 OF 07  110730Z </p><p>THANH DISTRICT WHO DO NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY YET WOULD BE </p><p>WILLING TO PAY EVEN TWICE WHAT HIS MEMBERS PAY FOR </p><p>ELECTRICITY OR EVEN HIGHER, "UP TO A CERTAIN PRICE." </p><p> </p><p>PRIVATE WATER SUPPLIER BUMPS UP AGAINST OWN SUCCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>9. EVEN FEWER RURAL VIETNAMESE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO </p><p>"CLEAN" WATER -- JUST 32 PERCENT ACCORDING TO MARD -- THAN </p><p>TO ELECTRICITY.  AS WITH ELECTRICITY, A LACK OF CAPITAL </p><p>HAS FORCED THE GVN TO ENCOURAGE COOPERATIVES AND PRIVATE </p><p>INVESTMENT.  PRIVATE COMPANIES SUPPLIED WATER TO 4,000 </p><p>HOUSEHOLDS IN BEN TRE PROVINCE IN 1999 AND HAD INVESTED </p><p>USD 1.4 MILLION, MORE THAN STATE INVESTMENT IN WATER </p><p>SUPPLY.  VO VAN THUY\'S TAN AN PRIVATE COMPANY HAS FOUR </p><p>WATER FILTERING PLANTS IN RURAL BEN TRE AND NEIGHBORING </p><p>VINH LONG PROVINCE.  THUY, WHO HAD MONEY TO INVEST EARNED </p><p>FROM BUYING AND TRANSPORTING LOGS IN CENTRAL VIETNAM, </p><p>FIRST SAW DEMAND FOR WATER AS A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN </p><p>HIS NATIVE VINH LONG IN 1996.  FRIENDS FROM VINH LONG\'S </p><p>WATER SUPPLY COMPANY HELPED WITH THE DESIGN. </p><p> </p><p>10. TAN AN\'S CUSTOMERS IN TINH THANH COMMUNE OF CHO LACH </p><p>DISTRICT PAY VND 2,500 (18 CENTS) PER CUBIC METER OF WATER </p><p>IF THEY PAY FOR THE CONNECTING PIPELINES TO THEIR HOMES, </p><p>OF VND 3,500 (25 CENTS) PER CUBIC METER IF TAN AN PAYS FOR </p><p>HOOK-UP.  THE BEN TRE WATER SUPPLY COMPANIES CHARGES </p><p>INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS VND 2,200 (16 CENTS), BUT CHARGES </p><p>OTHER CUSTOMERS TWO HIGHER PRICES.  TAN AN\'S PRICE AND ANY </p><p>CHANGES ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF BEN TRE\'S </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.  THE DEPARTMENT AGREED TO TAN AN\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  03 OF 07  110730Z </p><p>HIGHER PRICE FOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OVER THE PROTESTS OF </p><p>THE TINH THANH PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE BECAUSE TAN AN HAS TO </p><p>COVER A CORPORATE PROFIT TAX OF 32 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>11. THUY SAID HE IS NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE BEN TRE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TAKING OVER HIS CUSTOMERS AS PUBLIC WATER </p><p>SUPPLY EVENTUALLY EXPANDS, BECAUSE IT IS INEFFICIENT.  THE </p><p>TWO 100 CUBIC METER-PER-DAY WATER PLANTS IN CHO LACH </p><p>DISTRICT BUILT BY THE BEN TRE GOVERNMENT COST BETWEEN USD </p><p>14,300 AND USD 17,900 TO BUILD AND WOULD ONLY HAVE COST </p><p>THUY USD 10,700.  (IN FEBRUARY 2000 THE BEN TRE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE SUSPENDED THE BEN TRE WATER SUPPPLY COMPANY\'S </p><p>DIRECTOR AND CHIEF ACCOUNTANT FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, </p><p>"ILLEGAL COLLECTION AND SPENDING OF USD 100,000.)  THUY\'S </p><p>PLANTS, WHICH ONLY REQUIRE ONE WORKER FOUR HOURS PER DAY </p><p>TO OPERATE, BREAK EVEN AFTER 4-5 YEARS AND WILL LAST 30 </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>12. THUY WANTS TO (###) </p><p>PLANTS.  HE MADE PROPOSALS TO VINH LONG AND TRA VINH </p><p>PROVINCES, BUT BOTH PREFERRED TO WAIT FOR FOREIGN DONORS </p><p>TO FUND MORE EXPENSIVE WATER PLANTS.  (COMMENT:  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, A DUTCH-FUNDED WATER SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE SYSTEM </p><p>IN DONG THAP PROVINCE SUPPLYING 10,200 CUBIC METERS OF </p><p>WATER PER DAY COST USD 5.5 MILLION.  END COMMENT.)  THUY </p><p>DOES NOT WANT TO BUILD MORE COMMUNE-LEVEL WATER PLANTS IN </p><p>BEN TRE PROVINCE BECAUSE HE IS ALREADY SERVING THE THREE </p><p>COMMUNES WITH THE STRONGEST DEMAND, AND HE IS CONCERNED </p><p>THAT HIS KNOWN SUCCESS WOULD RESULT IN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH </p><p>LAND LEASE COSTS. </p><p>NOTE:  (##)OMISSION IN PARA 12.  CORRECTION WILL FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COCONUT AND DURIAN DREAMS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. RIVERINE BEN TRE PROVINCE IS VIETNAM\'S COCONUT </p><p>CAPITAL, WITH 30,000 HECTARES AND ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF 200- </p><p>220 MILLION COCONUTS.  TRADERS FROM HCMC AND HANOI </p><p>CONVERGED ON BEN TRE IN 1995 TO BUY UP HAND-MADE COCONUT </p><p>CANDY FOR EXPORT TO CHINA, STIMULATING THE CREATION OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01121  04 OF 07  110410Z </p><p>MORE THAN 100 SMALL COMPANIES.  PRODUCTION ROSE TO 7 TONS </p><p>PER DAY, THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WERE EMPLOYED, AND THE </p><p>PROVINCE EARNED USD 10 MILLION.  BY 1997, CHINESE </p><p>BUSINESSES IN HAINAN HAD HIRED AWAY SKILLED WORKERS FROM </p><p>BEN TRE AND STARTED MAKING THEIR OWN COCONUT CANDY.  BEN </p><p>TRE\'S CANDY EXPORT REVENUES FELL TO USD 300,000.  IN 1999, </p><p>DEMAND FROM CHINA (MOSTLY FOR COCONUT JUICE BUT ALSO FOR </p><p>CANDY) AND THAILAND RAISED THE PRICE OF COCONUTS IN BEN </p><p>TRE TO VND 29,000 (USD 2.07) PER DOZEN.  ALTHOUGH THIS WAS </p><p>GOOD FOR EXPORTERS OF UNPROCESSED AND SEMI-PROCESSED </p><p>COCONUT PRODUCTS -- COCONUT EXPORTS WERE OVER USD 10 </p><p>MILLION IN 1999 -- IT FURTHER HARMED THE COCONUT CANDY AND </p><p>OTHER COCONUT PROCESSING INDUSTRIES.  THESE INCLUDE </p><p>COCONUT OIL, CHARCOAL, JUICE, HANDICRAFTS, AND </p><p>CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS.  BY LATE 1999, ONLY 27 CANDY </p><p>MAKERS, 6 OF 33 OIL PRODUCERS, AND 30 OF 55 CHARCOAL </p><p>PRODUCERS WERE STILL OPERATING. </p><p> </p><p>14. CONGEN STAFF CALLED ON MS. PHAM THI TO, WHOSE </p><p>BESPECTACLED IMAGE ADORNS HER BRANDED "BEN TRE COCONUT </p><p>CANDY," FOR WHICH SHE REGISTERED HER TRADEMARK IN 1988. </p><p>ABANDONED BY HER HUSBAND AND LEFT WITH EIGHT YOUNG </p><p>CHILDREN, MS. TO\'S FORTUNES BEGAN TO CHANGE IN 1976 WHEN </p><p>SHE LEARNED HOW TO MAKE COCONUT CANDY, IMPROVED THE </p><p>RECIPE, AND MUCH LATER MECHANIZED PRODUCTION.  SINCE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT STRICTLY CONTROLLED RICE, SUGAR, AND COCONUTS, </p><p>HER MAIN INGREDIENTS, SHE CONDUCTED BUSINESS UNDERGROUND </p><p>AND INTERMITTENTLY FOR 12 YEARS.  BY 1988, WHEN THE GVN </p><p>BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT THE DOI MOI POLICY, MS. TO RECEIVED A </p><p>LOAN FROM THE LOCAL WOMEN\'S UNION AND EXPANDED HER </p><p>BUSINESS.  (SHE HAS MOSTLY SELF-FINANCED AND HAS NEVER HAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  04 OF 07  110410Z </p><p>A BANK LOAN.)  OTHER FACTORIES IN BEN TRE AND HAININ ARE </p><p>HER IMITATORS. </p><p> </p><p>15. IT WAS ONE OF MS. TO\'S AGENTS WHO INTRODUCED HER CANDY </p><p>TO THE CHINESE MARKET.  WHEN HER SALES TO CHINA DROPPED </p><p>OFF FROM A PEAK OF 400 TONS PER MONTH, MS. TO TRAVELLED TO </p><p>CHINA IN 1998 AND A DISCOVERED ONE HAINAN COMPANY </p><p>IMITATING HER TRADEMARK AND PACKAGING.  (THE CHINESE </p><p>COMPANY DIRECTOR WAS MARRIED TO A VIETNAMESE WOMAN FROM </p><p>BEN TRE, AND THEY HAD HIRED AWAY A TECHNICIAN FROM MS. </p><p>TO.)  TRAVELLING TO CHINA AGAIN, SHE FILED PETITIONS TO </p><p>REGISTER HER TRADEMARK THERE AND TO PROHIBIT ITS MISUSE BY </p><p>HER CHINESE COMPETITOR, CULMINATING IN A SUCCESSFUL </p><p>ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST THE INFRINGER IN 1999. </p><p>ALTHOUGH HER SALES WERE STILL DOWN 80 TONS PER MONTH AND </p><p>HER WORKFORCE DOWN TO 400 FROM A HIGH OF 1,000 WORKERS, </p><p>MS. TO WAS OPTIMISTIC SHE THEY WOULD SOON BE BACK AT THEIR </p><p>1995-1997 LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>16. MOST COCONUT FARMERS PRODUCE A LOW-YIELD VARIETY </p><p>DESPITE THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH-YIELD HYBRIDS.  MOST </p><p>SURVIVE ON INCOMES OF LITTLE MORE THAN VND 1.0 MILLION </p><p>(USD 71) PER YEAR, EXTREME POVERTY EVEN BY VIETNAMESE </p><p>STANDARDS.  CONGEN STAFF VISITED MR. DO THANH THUONG, </p><p>DUBBED VIETNAM\'S COCONUT KING AFTER WINNING A PRIZE FROM </p><p>THE ASIA PACIFIC COCONUT COUNCIL (APCC) FOR HIS TECHNIQUES </p><p>FOR TRANSPLANTING HYBRID COCONUT TREES DEVELOPED BY THE </p><p>GVN\'S VEGETABLE OIL RESEARCH INSTITUTE.  THE PB-121 HYBRID </p><p>HAS HIGHER YIELDS, GREATER FAT CONTENT, AND BEARS FRUIT </p><p>EARLIER.  THUONG DARED TO REPLACE HIS TREES WITH THE </p><p>HYBRID IN 1995 ON HIS 2.5 HECTARES OF LAND AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>HIS NEIGHBORS WERE CUTTING DOWN THEIR TREES BECAUSE OF LOW </p><p>PROFITS.  A 63-YEAR-OLD GRADUATE IN PHYSICS, THUONG </p><p>COMPLAINED THAT ALTHOUGH HE WAS INVITED TO TRAVEL ABROAD </p><p>TO ACCEPT APCC PRIZE, A STATE COMPANY OFFICIAL WAS SENT TO </p><p>COLLECT IT FOR HIM.  COCONUT PRICES HAD DROPPED WAY DOWN </p><p>AGAIN IN 2000 FROM THEIR 1999 PEAK AND WERE NOW VND 13,000 </p><p>(93 CENTS) PER DOZEN. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01121  05 OF 07  110411Z </p><p>17. EVEN AT THE PEAK, THUONG SAID, COCONUT FARMERS COULD </p><p>NOT EARN AS MUCH AS FROM PLANTING FRUIT TREES, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE LATTER REQUIRED MORE INVESTMENT AND WAS HARDER WORK. </p><p>COCONUT FARMERS WERE AT THE MERCY OF TRADERS, WHO DIVIDED </p><p>UP THE MARKET AND COLLUDED WITH EACH OTHER, AND WOULD BE </p><p>BETTER OFF IF THEY COULD MARKET THEIR OWN OUTPUT OR SELL </p><p>DIRECTLY TO PROCESSING FACTORIES, HE THOUGHT.  THEIR </p><p>BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS NEVER KNOWING THE CURRENT MARKET </p><p>PRICE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT BEEN OF ANY USE IN </p><p>PROVIDING PRICE INFORMATION, AND EVEN ITS AGRICULTURAL </p><p>EXTENSION WORKERS LEARNED MORE FROM THE FARMERS THAN </p><p>HELPED THE FARMERS.  THE DONG GO COCONUT RESEARCH CENTER </p><p>IN BEN TRE DID NOT SEEM TO BE DOING MUCH, AND THUONG AND </p><p>HIS NEIGHBORS CONDUCTED THEIR OWN SOIL ANALYSIS FOR </p><p>DIVERSIFICATION INTO OTHER FRUIT CROPS.  (COMMENT:  THE </p><p>DONG GO CENTER IS GROWING 47 STRAINS OF COCONUT WITH </p><p>FUNDING FROM FAO AND UNDP.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>18. IN ADDITION TO THE COCONUT KING, BEN TRE IS ALSO HOME </p><p>TO VIETNAM\'S DURIAN KING, NGUYEN KHOA CHIEN (NICKNAMED </p><p>CHIN HOA, BEING THE NINTH SON OF HIS PARENTS).  IN 1978, A </p><p>SINGLE DURIAN TREE OF A NEARLY EXTINCT VARIETY REMAINED </p><p>AMONG THE OTHER DURIAN TREES ON THE FAMILY PROPERTY. </p><p>CHIEN SUCCEEDED IN GRAFTING SPRIGS FROM THIS RARE STRAIN </p><p>ONTO OTHER TREES, CREATING THE LOCALLY CHERISHED "FLAT </p><p>SEED DURIAN" OR "CHIN HOA DURIAN," WHICH IS SWEET </p><p>SMELLING, HAS THICK PULP, AND VERY SMALL SEEDS.  HE THEN </p><p>WENT TO WORK ON PLANTING TREES GROWN FROM THIS HYBRID AND </p><p>SELLING SEEDLINGS PRODUCED FROM THE TREES, KEEPING UP TO </p><p>DATE ON CULTIVATION TECHNOLOGY, PROVIDING AFTER-SALES </p><p>TECHNICAL ADVICE, AND OBTAINING GOVERNMENT RECOGNITION OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  05 OF 07  110411Z </p><p>HIS VARIETY.  HIS DURIANS ARE SO POPULAR THAT HE RATIONS </p><p>SALES OF HIS OUTPUT TO FAVORED CUSTOMERS AND COULD GET </p><p>AWAY WITH CHARGING MUCH MORE IF CHOSE. </p><p> </p><p>19. CHIEN\'S AFTER-TAX ANNUAL INCOME FROM THE SALES OF 57 </p><p>TONS OF DURIAN AND THOUSANDS OF SEEDLINGS IS OVER VND 1.0 </p><p>BILLION (USD 714,000), MAKING HIM ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN </p><p>IN THE MEKONG DELTA (CERTAINLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER </p><p>WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT).  HIS HOUSE IN CHO LACH </p><p>DISTRICT, HOWEVER, IS ON A NARROW, MUD TRAIL A KILOMETER </p><p>OFF THE MAIN ROAD AND STILL HAS A THATCHED ROOF AND HARD </p><p>MUD FLOOR.  ACCORDING TO CHIEN, VIETNAM\'S DURIANS, LIKE </p><p>THAILAND\'S, CAN BE EXPORTED, SINCE THEY RIPEN FOR FOUR </p><p>DAYS AFTER HARVESTING AND REMAIN EDIBLE FOR A WEEK AFTER, </p><p>LONGER IF REFRIGERATED AND LONGER STILL IF FROZEN. </p><p>ALTHOUGH MORE FARMERS ARE PLANTING DURIAN CURRENTLY, </p><p>VOLUMES ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A STEADY SUPPLY FOR </p><p>EXPORT.  DURIAN PRODUCTION IS EXPANDING IN BINH DUONG AND </p><p>BINH PHUOC PROVINCES, WHERE THE LAND IS BETTER AND THE </p><p>SOIL MORE SUITABLE FOR DURIANS.  A COMPANY IN BUON ME </p><p>THUOT IN DAK LAK PROVINCE HAS PLANTED 4,000 TREES USING </p><p>CHIEN\'S SEEDS AND PLANS TO EXPORT. </p><p> </p><p>NICEST PLACE IN BEN TRE TOWN IS THE ORPHANAGE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. BEN TRE TOWN, THE CENTER OF BEN TRE PROVINCE, HAS NO </p><p>HOTELS OR RESTAURANTS AT A STANDARD WHICH WOULD APPEAL TO </p><p>FOREIGN VISITORS.  THE PROVINCE, TRULY ONE OF VIETNAM\'S </p><p>BACKWATERS, HAS RECEIVED SPECIAL ATTENTION FROM UNDP FOR </p><p>POVERTY ALLEVIATION (REF A).  SO IT SEEMS A BIT ODD THAT </p><p>THE EEM GROUP OF FRANCE, OWNER OF THE SUCCESSFUL VICTORIA </p><p>CHAIN OF HOTELS IN SAPA, CAN THO, CHAU DOC, AND PHAN THIET </p><p>AND UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN HOI AN, HAS BEGUN CONSTRUCTION </p><p>OF A HOTEL IN TOWN.  (THIS IS ONE OF ONLY TWO FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENTS IN ALL OF BEN TRE, AND THE OTHER ONE IS NOT </p><p>OPERATING YET, EITHER.  EEM HAS WITHDRAWN FROM PLANS TO </p><p>ALSO BUILD AN ECO-TOURISM ISLAND RESORT IN A MEKONG RIVER </p><p>ESTUARY IN CHAU THANH DISTRICT IN BEN TRE.)  VO VINH BINH, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01121  06 OF 07  110733Z </p><p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF EEM\'S JOINT VENTURE, EXPLAINED THAT A </p><p>PORTION OF THE HUNDREDS OF FOREIGN TOURISTS WHO TAKE DAY </p><p>TRIPS FROM HCMC TO MY THO IN TIEN GIANG PROVINCE AND CROSS </p><p>INTO BEN TRE PROVINCE WOULD WANT TO STAY OVERNIGHT, SINCE </p><p>THIS IS A TIRING ONE-DAY TRIP.  AS WITH OTHER VICTORIA </p><p>HOTELS, THE LOCAL JOINT VENTURE PARTNER WILL HAVE ITS OWN </p><p>BLOC OF ROOMS IT WILL SELL AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE. </p><p> </p><p>21. IN 10 DIFFERENT CITIES IN VIETNAM, ONE NOTICES GATED </p><p>SPACIOUS COMPOUNDS WITH MODERN BUILDINGS AND SPACIOUS, </p><p>GREEN GROUNDS THAT LOOK DISTINCTLY UN-VIETNAMESE.  THESE </p><p>ARE SOS VILLAGES FOR ABANDONED, ORPHANED AND DESTITUTE </p><p>CHILDREN, FUNDED BY THE AUSTRIAN-BASED, INTERNATIONAL NGO </p><p>SOS-KINDERDORF INTERNATIONAL (S-K).  IN BEN TRE, THE SOS </p><p>VILLAGE, JUST OPENED IN 1999, STANDS OUT EVEN MORE THAN </p><p>USUAL.  ACCORDING TO ITS DIRECTOR, HUYNH CONG BINH, BEN </p><p>TRE WAS IDENTIFIED IN 1995 AS A LOCATION FOR AN SOS </p><p>VILLAGE BY THE S-K REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN HANOI AND THE </p><p>GVN BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF ORPHANED, DISABLED, OR </p><p>ABANDONED CHILDREN IN THE PROVINCE, PUT AT 7-8 PERCENT. </p><p>THE VILLAGE CAN ACCOMMODATE 12 "FAMILIES" OF 9-10 CHILDREN </p><p>EACH OF DIFFERENT AGES AND GENDER LIVING IN IMMACULATE </p><p>HOUSES NAMED AFTER FLOWERS.  AFTER THAY ARE FOURTEEN, </p><p>CHILDREN ARE HOUSED SEPARATELY BY GENDER BUT ARE STILL </p><p>PART OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES.  EACH FAMILY IS HEADED </p><p>BY A SINGLE WOMAN WHO MAKES A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT.  AT </p><p>THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 2000, THE BEN TRE SOS VILLAGE </p><p>HAD SET UP 9 FAMILIES AND HAD A TOTAL OF 70 CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>22. BEN TRE PROVINCE PROVIDED THE LARGE, WELL-LOCATED 45 </p><p>HECTARE PLOT OF LAND FOR THE VILLAGE AND FREE MEDICAL CARE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  06 OF 07  110733Z </p><p>AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EDUCATION FOR THE VILLAGE\'S </p><p>CHILDREN.  S-K PROVIDED THE DESIGN FOR THE VILLAGE, FUNDED </p><p>ITS CONSTRUCTION, AND WILL PAY FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND </p><p>UNIVERSITY FEES AND BOOKS, AND FOR JOB SEARCHES UPON </p><p>GRADUATION.  IT WILL ALSO FUND CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW </p><p>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR VILLAGE AND LOCAL CHILDREN. TOTAL </p><p>CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE NEARLY USD 1.5 MILLION.  OPERATING </p><p>COSTS COME OUT TO JUST OVER USD 20 PER CHILD PER MONTH, </p><p>INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AND ARE FUNDED BY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DONORS.  TYPICALLY, HOUSE MOTHERS HAVE TO </p><p>SCRIMP TO MAKE THEIR FOOD BUDGETS STRETCH AND GROW THEIR </p><p>OWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.  AT FIRST, LOCAL RESIDENTS </p><p>BELIEVED THE VILLAGE\'S CHILDREN WERE BEING GIVEN MORE </p><p>ADVANTAGES THAN THEIR OWN, BUT THE VILLAGE CONDUCTED </p><p>PUBLIC RELATIONS AND RESIDENTS SAW THAT THE LIVING </p><p>STANDARD INSIDE THE VILLAGE WAS NOT HIGHER THAN (#####) </p><p>CHILDREN\'S BACKGROUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>23. THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN THE PROVINCE UNDER </p><p>NINE-YEARS-OLD WHO WERE NOT DISABLED OR SICK, WHO WERE </p><p>EITHER ORPHANS, HAD ONE PARENT BUT WERE ABANDONED, OR WHO </p><p>WERE ABUSED, WERE CONSIDERED FOR PLACEMENT IN THE VILLAGE. </p><p>A SURVEY SHOWED 190 CHILDREN MET THESE CONDITIONS, AND </p><p>THOSE WITH THE LEAST ALTERNATIVE SUPPORT WERE SELECTED. </p><p>THE PLACEMENT PROCESS IS ACCORDING TO VIETNAMESE LAW AND </p><p> </p><p>NOTE:  (##)OMISSION IN PARA 22.  CORRECTION WILL FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REGULATION AND IS SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW IF BLOOD </p><p>RELATIONS DISPUTE THE DECISION.  BINH SAID THE SOS VILLAGE </p><p>WELCOMES VISITS AND DONATIONS, WHICH GO TO THE OPERATING </p><p>BUDGET, FROM ALL GROUPS, AS THE CHILDREN NEED ATTENTION SO </p><p>THEY DO NOT FEEL ABANDONED BY SOCIETY.  CONGEN STAFF FOUND </p><p>THE CHILDREN EXTREMELY POLITE, LOQUACIOUS, AND EAGER TO </p><p>SHOW OFF THEIR NEATLY PUT AWAY TOYS AND ARTWORK AFTER </p><p>BEING INVITED TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>JOHN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
