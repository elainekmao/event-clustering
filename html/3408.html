<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001754 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE SAYS IT WILL ACCEDE TO ALL </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 1665 </p><p> </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 125639 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Todd Faulk for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On July 30, post received a dipnote from Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs replying to our dipnote of July </p><p>15 informing the GOZ of the U.S.\'s accession to all 12 UN </p><p>anti-terrorism conventions (REF A).  The GOZ\'s note stated: </p><p>"The Ministry wishes to advise that as a demonstration of its </p><p>commitment to fight terrorism, Zimbabwe is considering the </p><p>outstanding nine conventions with a view to acceding to the </p><p>same in the near future." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Comment: This is the first positive communication we </p><p>have received from the MFA this year.  The dipnote, combined </p><p>with the Minister of Justice\'s tabling in Parliament of one </p><p>of the conventions in May (REF A), indicates the GOZ still </p><p>treats counter-terrorism issues with some seriousness. </p><p>Although the dipnote was vague on timing, we may look forward </p><p>to some action on the outstanding conventions in the current </p><p>session of Parliament, which began on July 23.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
