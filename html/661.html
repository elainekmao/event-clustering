AS PER REF A REQUEST, THE FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY </p><p>TRANSLATION OF THE "ELEFTHEROS TYPOS" ARTICLE ON </p><p>IRA/IRANIAN CONNECTIONS.  ALSO SEE PARA 3 FOR AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL MEDIA REPORT ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>GREEK AND BRITISH AUTHORITIES SUSPECT THAT A LARGE </p><p>QUANTITY OF HEROIN SMUGGLED TO ENGLAND BY TWO GERMANS </p><p>WHO WERE ARRESTED, WAS INTENDED TO HELP FINANCE IRA </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO RELIABLE INFORMATION FROM "ELEFTHEROS </p><p>TYPOS;" A GROUP OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AGENTS </p><p>SPECIALIZING IN IRA ACTIVITIES WILL BE VISITING ATHENS </p><p>AND HAVE REQUESTED A BRIEFING FROM GREEK AUTHORITIES ON </p><p>THE EVIDENCE IN THE DRUG SMUGGLING CASE. </p><p> </p><p>THE TWO GERMANS, YURGEN MERX AND HIS WIFE TUNZA-ANNETTE </p><p>MERX, ADMITTED TO SMUGGLING LARGE QUANTITIES OF </p><p>NARCOTICS TO GREAT BRITAIN ON FOUR OCCASIONS.  BRITISH </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE TRAVELED TO GREECE IN HOPES OF </p><p>DETERMINING THE BRITISH RECIPIENTS OF THE NARCOTICS. </p><p>THEY HAVE DEDUCED FROM THE GERMANS TESTIMONY THAT THE </p><p>NARCOTICS WERE INTENDED TO FINANCE IRA ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO INFORMATION EXCHANGED BETWEEN RELEVANT </p><p>AGENCIES, THE SECRET IRANIAN SERVICES ARE BEHIND THE </p><p>PREVIOUSLY SMUGGLED A MUCH LARGER AMOUNT. </p><p> </p><p>THE INVESTIGATION FOCUSED ON PATRICK O\'BRIAN, A 40 YEAR- </p><p>OLD IRISHMAN FROM LIMERICK, WHO FOLLOWED THE SAME ROUTE </p><p>AS THE GERMANS AND WAS ALSO ARRESTED IN GREECE.  HE HAD </p><p>SMUGGLED NARCOTICS WORTH 500 MILLION DRACHMAS (USD 2 </p><p>MILLION) FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND TURKEY TO GREAT </p><p>BRITAIN.  LAST SEPTEMBER O\'BRIAN WAS SENTENCED TO SERVE </p><p>A NINE YEAR PRISON TERM IN GREECE.  BOTH GREEK AND </p><p>BRITISH AUTHORITIES HAVE CONNECTED THE O\'BRIAN CASE WITH </p><p>THE RECENT GERMAN ARREST. </p><p> </p><p>ON JANUARY 14, THE ARAB NEWSPAPER "AL WATAN AL ARABI," </p><p>PUBLISHED IN BEIRUT AND PARIS, CONTAINED A DETAILED </p><p>REPORT ON IRA CONTACTS WITH THE IRANIAN SECRET SERVICES. </p><p>THE NEWSPAPER NAMED AMIR HOUSEIN TAGAVI AS HEAD OF THE </p><p>WESTERN EUROPEAN SECTION OF THE IRANIAN SECRET SERVICES, </p><p>AND POSITED THAT TAGAVI COORDINATES CONTACTS BETWEEN THE </p><p>IRA AND (THE GREEK TERRORIST GROUP) "17 NOVEMBER" AND </p><p>THE "REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL" OF ABU NIDAL AND THE </p><p>HEZBOLLAH. </p><p> </p><p>LAST JANUARY THE ITALIAN NEWSPAPER "CORRIERE DE LA </p><p>SERRA" REPORTED THAT 17 NOVEMBER MEMBERS HAD VISITED </p><p>TEHRAN AND HAD CONTACTS WITH THE IRANIAN SECRET </p><p>SERVICES.  IRANIAN OFFICIALS HAVE DENIED ANY </p><p>CONNECTIONS, WHILE THE ITALIAN JOURNALIST INSISTS ON THE </p><p>ACCURACY OF HIS INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF A SEPARATE </p><p>MAY 4 STORY BY THE GREEK DAILY "ELEFTHEROTYPIA" ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE: </p><p> </p><p>FROM LONDON, THE NEWSPAPER "INDEPENDENT" PUBLISHED AN </p><p>ARTICLE YESTERDAY REPORTING THAT IRAN OFFERED GUNS AND </p><p>MONEY TO THE IRA, ASKING IN RETURN THAT ITS ASSASSINS </p><p>MURDER TOP IRANIAN DISSIDENTS.  REFERRING TO WELL </p><p>INFORMED SOURCES, THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER ALSO REPORTED </p><p>THAT OFFICIALS OF THE IRANIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES </p><p>PROPOSED THIS DURING A SECRET MEETING IN TEHRAN, LAST </p><p>NOVEMBER.  AFTER THREE MONTHS, HOWEVER, THE IRA REJECTED </p><p>THE OFFER.  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GREEK TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION 17 NOVEMBER, AS WELL AS THE ETA, </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>LAST WEEK, THE IRANIAN CHARGE D\'AFFAIRS IN LONDON HAS </p><p>SUMMONED TO THE MFA AND HAS ASKED THAT THE CONTACTS OF </p><p>IRAN WITH THE IRA BE STOPPED.  THOSE CONTACTS WERE </p><p>DISCLOSED BY THE BRITISH INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>NILES </p><p></p></div>
