<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003905 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, June 30, is the </p><p>visit to the region of U.S. National Security Advisor </p><p>Rice.  Reports also highlight the agreed "truce" of </p><p>Palestinian militant groups and the Israeli withdrawal </p><p>from Gaza.  Papers also highlight a "new American </p><p>military offensive" against continued "resistance" in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Condoleezza Rice: she might succeed where men have </p><p>failed" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(06/30):  "By signing a joint document declaring the </p><p>truce and handing it to the Palestinian government, </p><p>the Palestinian factions have taken a correct step </p><p>towards supporting Palestinian legitimacy.  They have </p><p>provided this government with an opportunity to </p><p>present the Palestinian cause once more in a light </p><p>that would win the world\'s understanding for the </p><p>urgency of finding a political solution that would </p><p>enable the Palestinian people to restore their rights </p><p>and establish their state.  This agreement saves Abu </p><p>Mazen\'s government, first and foremost, but also </p><p>protects the Palestinian factions, whom Israel wants </p><p>to see disagree so that it can pursue them and kill </p><p>their leaders..  The United States seems now to be </p><p>more interested in the roadmap, in removing all </p><p>obstacles that stand in its way, particularly Israeli </p><p>obstacles, and in implementing the agreement with </p><p>equality and balance.  This is clear from Ms. Rice\'s </p><p>visit to the region and her successful meeting with </p><p>Mahmoud Abbas." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Washington\'s objection to building the dividing </p><p>wall: the beginning of a practical stand" </p><p> </p><p>Semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai (06/30) </p><p>editorializes:  "Reports leaked by the Israeli media </p><p>about the heated discussion between Advisor </p><p>Condoleezza Rice and the Sharon government show a </p><p>relatively more understanding American position </p><p>towards the nature of the Palestinian-Israeli </p><p>conflict..  Washington\'s stand now indicates America\'s </p><p>seriousness to handle the conflict in accordance with </p><p>the roadmap, which seems to be the final opportunity </p><p>to salvage the peace process." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
