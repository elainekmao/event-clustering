<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003242 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAL, ASEC, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIANS AWAIT PRESIDENT\'S MIDDLE EAST </p><p>STATEMENT, HOPE FOR U.S. PLAN, BUT DON\'T EXPECT MUCH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Jordanians, confused about the direction of U.S. </p><p>Middle East policy, are nervously awaiting President Bush\'s </p><p>Middle East policy statement, hoping (but doubting) that it </p><p>will bring clarity and the prospect of genuine progress for </p><p>the Palestinians.  Most Jordanians see U.S. engagement in the </p><p>MEPP as the only way to break the current spiral of violence, </p><p>although most are also highly suspicious of U.S. motives and </p><p>doubt U.S. commitment to take hard decisions regarding </p><p>Israel.  In the end, it is the concrete results of any new </p><p>U.S. proposal -- not the words of the President\'s remarks -- </p><p>to which Jordanians will look to measure American resolve to </p><p>reach peace.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>WAITING TO EXHALE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The withdrawal of Israeli forces from most of the </p><p>West Bank in May, and the consequent reduction of daily </p><p>Palestinian casualty and arrest figures, has reduced the </p><p>level of tension in Jordan:  the loudest wedding season for </p><p>the past two years has begun, and students are sitting for </p><p>the annual end of secondary school "tawjihi" exams.  Even </p><p>regular Israeli raids in the West Bank and Gaza have not </p><p>entirely soured the sense that something is happening on the </p><p>Middle East peace front.  Jordanians have been mildly </p><p>encouraged as a procession of Middle Eastern leaders -- PM </p><p>Sharon, King Abdullah, President Mubarak, PM Sharon again, </p><p>and Saudi Prince Saud -- have visited the White House and </p><p>given the President their views on where they think the </p><p>Middle East should go next.  Statements by the President, the </p><p>Secretary, and other senior U.S. officials that the President </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>is weighing his options on next steps have heightened the </p><p>sense that a new U.S. initiative is just around the corner. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. POLICY CONFUSING... AND CONFUSED </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  While our contacts are generally skeptical that the </p><p>speech will provide new U.S. support for the Palestinians, </p><p>there is no agreement on what it will mean for the region. </p><p>In fact, there is a clear sense here -- heightened by local </p><p>and Western press commentary -- that the U.S. has not yet </p><p>settled on the next steps of its policy.  "The (U.S.) </p><p>President says he supports a Palestinian state," one NGO </p><p>leader told us recently, "but what kind of State?  Real? </p><p>Provisional?  What are its borders?  What is its capital?" </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Pointing to differing statements from various </p><p>officials, many see a distinct split within the U.S. </p><p>administration.  "When," a senior MFA official asked us late </p><p>last week, "is the U.S. going to decide what its policy is." </p><p>The lack of clarity in U.S. policy, according to one </p><p>academic, has "left us (in the Middle East) without </p><p>direction." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>WHAT WILL BUSH SAY?  WILL HE BACK IT UP? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Consequently, a wide variety of Embassy contacts and </p><p>local editorial writers have focused their attention on what </p><p>President Bush will (or should) say about the future of U.S. </p><p>policy in the region.  "Most," said a senior Jordanian </p><p>banker, "assume that U.S. policy will be biased toward </p><p>Israel," especially following President Bush\'s recent </p><p>statements that Sharon is a "man of peace," that the </p><p>President is not prepared to offer a timetable for creation </p><p>of a Palestinian state, and the President\'s persistent focus </p><p>on Arafat\'s responsibility to act against Palestinian </p><p>terrorists. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  However, statements by the Secretary at the G-8 </p><p>meeting in Canada about the possibility of creating a </p><p>"provisional" Palestinian state, and Western and Israeli </p><p>press speculation that the U.S. will call for an end to </p><p>Israeli settlement activity have raised hopes among some in </p><p>the educated elite that the U.S. will set out a political </p><p>plan that leads to a Palestinian state and asks Israel to </p><p>take concrete actions. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The many nay sayers, however, doubt U.S. commitment </p><p>to peace in the Middle East, and dismiss out of hand </p><p>suggestions that the U.S. will try to force Israel to accept </p><p>even minimal Palestinian political demands.  One Jordan </p><p>University professor declared that, public statements aside, </p><p>"no U.S. President has ever supported (creation of) a </p><p>Palestinian state."  An always-cranky former Parliamentarian </p><p>opined last week that any new U.S. proposal would be merely </p><p>"a tool to keep Arab regimes in the War against Terrorism." </p><p>In any case, he concluded, "the Zionist lobby and the </p><p>Christian right" will prevent "any plan that Israel does not </p><p>like" from being implemented. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The bad news is that most Jordanians remain very </p><p>skeptical about U.S. motives and U.S. commitment to use its </p><p>position to deliver concrete Israeli concessions.  Those who </p><p>doubt U.S. motives will see even a positive speech as a way </p><p>to create motion in the peace process without real progress. </p><p>A presidential statement that offers no concrete political </p><p>gains for Palestinians and focuses on Palestinian </p><p>responsibilities (to reform, fight terrorism, or choose a new </p><p>leader) to the exclusion of needed Israeli actions could lead </p><p>to another round of demonstrations and other expressions of </p><p>public anger. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  The good news is that most Jordanians -- even many </p><p>of the nay sayers -- continue to see U.S. engagement as the </p><p>only way to solve the Middle East crisis.  Consequently, </p><p>there is intense attention focused on the President\'s </p><p>statement, and more than a little heightening of expectations </p><p>among those who hope for a U.S. role that offers more hope to </p><p>the Palestinians.  For Jordanians, however, the test of the </p><p>President\'s speech will not be the specific words he utters </p><p>or the plan he presents, but whether the U.S. takes concrete </p><p>actions to move forward on Palestinian political goals in </p><p>parallel with moves to ensure Israel\'s security. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
