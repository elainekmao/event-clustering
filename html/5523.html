Frank Urbancic for reason 1.5 ( </p><p>b) </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) On February 5, Embassy received a diplomatic note from </p><p>the Kuwaiti Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the </p><p>issuance of 100 entry visas for armed Kuwaiti air marshals. </p><p>Embassy informal translation of the text of the note reads as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>(Complimentary Open) </p><p>Because of the security condition the region is going through </p><p>and the desire to provide air protection to Kuwait Airways, </p><p>kindly issue entry visas for 100 armed air marshals, whose </p><p>photocopies of their passports are enclosed herewith, to </p><p>enable them to accompany the aircraft of that airline.  We </p><p>hope you will treat this as urgent. </p><p>(Complimentary Close) </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) Post notes the procedure to request air marshals </p><p>outlined in reftel, and also recalls a May 2002 visit by </p><p>CASLO Rome to Kuwait when a letter detailing steps to request </p><p>air marshals was presented to Kuwait air security officials. </p><p>The letter notes that foreign ministries must present a </p><p>diplomatic note announcing their intent to begin such a </p><p>program 30 days in advance of the start date and certifying </p><p>that the proposed individuals are trained and authorized law </p><p>enforcement officers, among other items. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Post will follow up with Kuwaiti officials in the MFA, </p><p>the Ministry of Interior, and Kuwait Airways soonest to </p><p>collect information related to the air marshal program as </p><p>outlined in reftel.  Post would appreciate receiving any </p><p>updated guidance that may be pertinent to this request. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Comment:  While TSA guidelines require a minimum 30-day </p><p>notice for the start-up of an air marshal program, the </p><p>urgency of the Kuwaiti request is understandable.  We hope </p><p>TSA can work with the Embassy and the GOK to expedite </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>approval of this request. </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
