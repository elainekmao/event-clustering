<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 003117 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, GCC, EAID, EFIN, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UAEG UP-TO-DATE ON PALESTINIAN AID COMMITMENT </p><p> </p><p>Ref: SECSTATE 181425 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a meeting on June 25, the Ambassador delivered </p><p>Secretary Powell\'s oral message to MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Bin Zayid, stressing the need for the UAEG to fulfil the </p><p>commitment it made at the 2002 Beirut Summit to provide the </p><p>Palestinian Authority budgetary support.  The Ambassador noted </p><p>to Hamdan that our records reflect that the UAEG has thus far </p><p>paid 60 percent of its commitment as of June 1.  Hamdan </p><p>undertook to review the payment schedule of the UAEG\'s pledge </p><p>and stated that his office would provide us with a report on its </p><p>status. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On July 2, Hamdan\'s Deputy Office Director Khadim Al </p><p>Darei reported to Poloff that the UAEG has completely paid its </p><p>Beirut 2002 $21 million pledge to the Palestinian Authority.  Al </p><p>Dharei noted that the UAEG pledged an additional $21 million to </p><p>the Palestinian Authority in Sharm Al Sheikh in March 2003, </p><p>which the UAEG intends to pay in full by October 2003 as per the </p><p>terms of the pledge. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  We are confident that the UAEG will fulfill </p><p>its assistance to the Palestinian Authority as promised.  These </p><p>official pledges reflect only a portion of assistance provided </p><p>to the Palestinian people.  We note that President Zayed and the </p><p>UAE Red Crescent Authority have also made significant </p><p>contributions to the Occupied Territories and likely will </p><p>continue to do so in the future.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
