<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002322 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR DS/OP/AF AND DS/DSS/ITA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PREL, PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO FACES VIOLENT PROTEST IN KANO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM BRIAN L. BROWNE. REASON 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Instead of being a vehicle to improve his </p><p>image in Northern public opinion, President Obasanjo\'s visit </p><p>to Kano has been mired in controversy over the police </p><p>response to anti-Obasanjo protests in that city. Over 35 </p><p>people were arrested when their demonstration turned violent </p><p>July 29. There are conflicting accounts about fatalities. </p><p>Media reports indicate seven people may have been killed by </p><p>police bullets; but these reports are unconfirmed and the GON </p><p>denies any killings. There were credible reports of people </p><p>wounded but the cause(s) of their injuries remain uncertain. </p><p>In any event, the protest both illustrate and further </p><p>reinforce Obasanjo\'s negative image in Kano and much of the </p><p>North. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) President Olusegun Obasanjo attended the launch of the </p><p>biography of the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Ado Bayero, at the </p><p>Emir\'s Palace July 29 as part of an official visit to Kano. </p><p>According to media reports, police fired after protesters </p><p>became more agitated and started to draw near when Obasanjo\'s </p><p>entourage left the venue. The protesters were shouting </p><p>pro-Buhari and pro-Mohammed Abacha slogans as well as </p><p>carrying placards of both men. (Note: Buhari is a </p><p>presidential hopeful whose popularity in Kano is significant </p><p>and whose criticism of Obasanjo has been stinging. Abacha, </p><p>the son of late Head of State Sani Abacha, remains jailed </p><p>despite the Supreme Court decision freeing him of charges in </p><p>the murder of Kudirat Abiola, wife of the annulled 1993 </p><p>election\'s putative victor Moshood Abiola. Quashing the </p><p>murder charges was part of a deal whereby Abacha would be </p><p>freed in exchange for the recovery of over one billion </p><p>dollars government funds stolen by the Abacha family. Since </p><p>the funds have not yet been transferred to its account, the </p><p>GON has delayed Abacha\'s release.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Several press reports claim that, as a result of the </p><p>police shootings and tear gas, 7 people were killed and </p><p>others wounded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Presidency promptly issued a July 30 statement </p><p>denying any fatalities. The press release stated "it is true </p><p>that a small group of people had displayed placards demanding </p><p>the release of Mohammed Abacha at the Emir\'s palace, venue of </p><p>the launching of the book."  The Presidency contended the </p><p>"police acted promptly to check the disruptive intention of </p><p>the protesters and dispersed them with tear-gas and </p><p>time-tested crowd-control measures."  The release criticized </p><p>local and foreign media organizations like BBC and VOA for </p><p>reporting the alleged shooting deaths. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Alhaji Aminu Kwaru, the Private Secretary to the Emir </p><p>of Kano, told our Political FSN that tear gas was fired but </p><p>there were no fatalities and he did not believe any shots </p><p>were fired. He blamed the incident on politicians exploiting </p><p>the emotions of unemployed and disgruntled youth.  Although </p><p>there was no evidence of fatalities, Kwaru would not discount </p><p>the possibility that some had been injured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) However, other Embassy sources claimed shots were </p><p>fired but they could not confirm if the shots were aimed at </p><p>the protesters or in the air. A BBC reporter saw several </p><p>injured demonstrators but no evidence of any fatalities.  The </p><p>Kano State Police Commissioner also denied any shooting </p><p>deaths. He did state that 37 protesters had been arrested for </p><p>causing a public disturbance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Considering the controversy overhanging Mohammed </p><p>Abacha\'s continued detention and that Buhari would also be at </p><p>the Emir\'s palace, Obasanjo was walking into unfriendly </p><p>territory when he entered Kano. Obasanjo also should have </p><p>expected a rough welcome given the treatment meted to V.P. </p><p>Atiku in Kano a few months ago. (Atiku was the target of rock </p><p>throwing at a book launching in May.) Given these factors, </p><p>the timing of the visit seemed ill advised. It suggests an </p><p>underestimation within the Presidency of the depth of the </p><p>opposition in Kano as well as an underestimation of the </p><p>extent to which Obasanjo\'s opponents will go to make him look </p><p>bad should he walk on their home turf. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Kano incident has generated negative media for </p><p>Obasanjo at a time when he does not need any more bad news. </p><p>Many people will make up their minds on what happened in Kano </p><p>based on their feelings about Obasanjo. Thus, despite the </p><p>lack of concrete evidence, many Obasanjo critics will believe </p><p>the killings took place because they want to think the worst </p><p>about Obasanjo and his government. On another level, this </p><p>event is another signal that the election campaign will be </p><p>tumultuous and occasioned by episodes of violence. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
