<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOIST PARTY PLENUM DECRIES ELECTIONS; CASTIGATES </p><p>U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) Summary:  An undated Maoist press release, signed by </p><p>Party President Prachanda, reported the successful conclusion </p><p>of a Party plenum.  The Nepali-language release outlines the </p><p>contents of a "political and organizational proposal" </p><p>presented by Prachanda which highlights a purported U.S. plot </p><p>to "capture" South Asia and "encircle" China; criticizes the </p><p>government\'s scheduling of elections as a false "drama"; and </p><p>renews previous calls for an interim government and a </p><p>constituent assembly.  The statement appears to be an attempt </p><p>to influence the Government of Nepal (GON) to postpone </p><p>elections in favor of establishing a constituent assembly. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) An undated Maoist press release, signed by Party </p><p>President Prachanda, reported the successful conclusion of a </p><p>Party plenum.  (Note:  The release does not state where or </p><p>when the meeting, whose probable participants are on the </p><p>Nepali Government\'s most wanted list, took place, but one </p><p>leftist party leader insists the location was in India.  The </p><p>release began appearing in local media in late June.  End </p><p>note.)  The statement reports the presentation of a </p><p>"political and organizational proposal" by Prachanda.  The </p><p>proposal, entitled "New Situation and New Responsibility," </p><p>charges that the U.S., in order to deflect attention from </p><p>domestic political and economic problems, is planning "a </p><p>volcanic clash between imperialism and the victimized </p><p>countries" by capturing South Asia and encircling China.  The </p><p>American plans, Prachanda contends, offer "a new historic </p><p>role" for South Asians to unite to defeat imperialism. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Most of the proposal\'s vitriol, however, is reserved </p><p>for the "feudal, tyrannical power" of the Palace, the </p><p>"terror" perpetrated by the Royal Nepal Army (RNA), and the </p><p>Palace\'s "worthless servant" Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba.  The Maoist broadsheet charges that this triad </p><p>connived to preserve the state of emergency and dissolve </p><p>Parliament to frustrate purported support from political </p><p>parties, including the Maoists, and others "for dialogue and </p><p>a peaceful, positive way out."  Calling mid-term elections </p><p>when the country is locked in "a deadly civil war" was a </p><p>"wicked move," Prachanda\'s statement says, and heaps </p><p>criticism on the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (UML), the largest Opposition party, for agreeing to </p><p>participate.  (Note:  A week after the release appeared in </p><p>the press, one UML party worker was killed, five severely </p><p>beaten, and five abducted by Maoists in Rukum District.  End </p><p>note.)  Maoist comrades, along with supporters "of the </p><p>historic people\'s movement of 1990" should unite in "another </p><p>historic movement in order to establish an interim government </p><p>. . . and elections for the constituent assembly." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Prachanda\'s statement further alleges that the </p><p>"People\'s Liberation Army" has improved markedly during the </p><p>six months since the imposition of the state of emergency, </p><p>noting progress in equipment, training and expansion to a </p><p>brigade level.  The Maoists could quickly finish off the RNA </p><p>"if it does not receive support from foreign imperialists," </p><p>the release charges, adding "the RNA\'s morale survives only </p><p>on the backing of America and the UK."  He also reported </p><p>decisions to make "important changes in organizational </p><p>structure" and "military mobilization." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment:  This latest press release was remarkable </p><p>for its length (more than three pages of text, single-spaced) </p><p>and for language even more tortured and convoluted than </p><p>usual.  Although a censorious phrase or two directed at the </p><p>U.S. is standard fare in Maoist propaganda, the discussion of </p><p>purported U.S. regional ambitions--and our "plan" to encircle </p><p>China--is new.  (Given the America-against-South Asia flavor </p><p>of the accusations, India, which is usually coupled with the </p><p>U.S. as enemies of the people in most Maoist diatribes, </p><p>merited not even a mention this time.)  Although recent </p><p>Maoist statements usually contain oblique references to </p><p>talks, this is the first time since the state of emergency </p><p>that we\'ve seen such explicit renewed calls for dialogue, an </p><p>interim government, and a constituent assembly.  The intense </p><p>criticism of the proposed November 13 general elections is </p><p>yet another indication that the insurgents intend actively to </p><p>sabotage them.  The references to dialogue may be intended to </p><p>signal Maoist willingness to be involved in a constituent </p><p>assembly, should one be constituted if elections are </p><p>postponed.  The leader of the leftist UML, which reportedly </p><p>maintains back-channel contacts with the Maoists, told the </p><p>Ambassador that he had firm evidence that the party plenum </p><p>was held in India, probably with the knowledge of Indian </p><p>intelligence agencies. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
