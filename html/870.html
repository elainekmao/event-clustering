<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ALGIERS 000952 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  3/14/2007 </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PTER, KISL, AG </p><p>SUBJECT:  NEW ARMED GROUPS JOINING THE OLD FIS? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A)  FBIS LD 1502183497  B)  ALGIERS 864 </p><p>      C)  96 ALGIERS 250, 632 AND 1062 </p><p>      D)  ALGIERS 931  E)  FBIS MM1212143096 </p><p>      F)  FBIS MM1109104796 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN, </p><p>AMEMBASSY ALGIERS, REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE ABILITY OF THE LONG-BANNED </p><p>ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT (FIS) TO RESTRAIN THE </p><p>ISLAMIST ARMED GROUPS HERE IS QUESTIONABLE.  OVER </p><p>TIME, HOWEVER, THE BARBAROUS ATROCITIES OF THE ARMED </p><p>ISLAMIC GROUP (GIA) MAY BE WORKING IN THE FIS\' FAVOR </p><p>AMONG ISLAMIST ARMED GROUPS.  THERE ARE SIGNS, </p><p>ALBEIT SMALL AND TENTATIVE, THAT MORE GROUPS ARE </p><p>CLAIMING LOYALTY TO THE ORIGINAL FIS LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>ABASSI MADANI AND ALI BENHADJ (JAILED SINCE 1991). </p><p>THERE ARE ALSO SOME HINTS THAT THESE GROUPS ARE </p><p>JOINING OR AT LEAST WORKING TOGETHER.  THEY HAVE </p><p>CALLED FOR MORAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORT FROM OUTSIDE </p><p>ISLAMIC "MOVEMENTS" (INCLUDING, PERHAPS, IRAN).  THE </p><p>NEW EFFORTS TOWARDS COORDINATION OR UNITY MAY NOT </p><p>SUCCEED IN THE END; THE ARMED ISLAMIST GROUPS ON THE </p><p>WHOLE REMAIN SERIOUSLY SPLIT IN TERMS OF IDEOLOGY </p><p>AND LEADERSHIP.  WE SEE NO SIGN THAT THEY ARE </p><p>STRONGER MILITARILY.  IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE GIVEN </p><p>NO INDICATION THEY WILL BE LOYAL TO THE FIS </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN EXILE, UNDER REBAH KEBIR IN GERMANY. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A NEW FIS ATTACK ON THE GIA </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THERE ARE SOME SMALL, AND STILL TENTATIVE, </p><p>INDICATIONS THAT THE ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT (FIS) </p><p>IS TRYING TO REASSERT CONTROL OVER THE ARMED GROUPS </p><p>ONCE LOYAL TO THE ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP (GIA).  THE </p><p>TREND SO FAR APPEARS LIMITED MAINLY TO CENTRAL </p><p>ALGERIA.  THE FEBRUARY 1997 ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC LEAGUE FOR THE (ISLAMIC) CALL AND FOR DJIHAD </p><p>(IN FRENCH, LIDD) EMPHASIZES THE LEAGUE\'S LOYALTY TO </p><p>ABASSI MADANI AND ALI BENHADJ (SEE REFS A AND B). </p><p>(IT ALSO PRAISES THE MEMORY OF ANOTHER FIS LEADER, </p><p>MOHAMED SAID, THE LEADER OF THE FIS\' DJAZAIR\'IST </p><p>WING.)  FOUR MEN SIGNED THE COMMUNIQUE.  THE FIRST </p><p>TWO, ALI BENHADJER AND MAHFOUD RAHMANI HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>THEIR STATUS AS FIS OFFICIALS ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT </p><p>IN 1991; THE THIRD, YOUSSEF BOUBRAS, NOTES THAT HE </p><p>WAS THE FIS PRESIDENT OF THE BOUIRA OFFICE AND LATER </p><p>A MEMBER OF THE FIS EXECUTIVE OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  THE LIDD COMMUNIQUE SINGLES OUT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S "PLOT" AGAINST THE ISLAMIC DJIHAD IN </p><p>ALGERIA AS BEING EMBODIED IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE </p><p>ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP (GIA).  THE CAMPAIGN, THE LIDD </p><p>SAID, DEVIATED INTO KILLING THE "BEST SCHOLARS, </p><p>PREACHERS AND MOUJADHIDINE."  IT THEN SAID THAT </p><p>FAITHFUL MUSLEM SOLDIERS ARE, THEREFORE, QUITTING </p><p>THE GIA.  IT CALLS ON THOSE YOUNG MEN IN THE GIA TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT MASSACRES ARE NOT JUSTIFIABLE UNDER </p><p>ISLAM, BUT RATHER ARE THE WORK OF THE ALGERIAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  THE LIDD COMMUNIQUE TOUCHES ONLY BRIEFLY ON </p><p>RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  IT STRONGLY </p><p>DENOUNCES PAST FRENCH COLONIAL POLICY IN ALGERIA. </p><p>(IT MAKES NO MENTION OF THE U.S.)  IT ALSO CALLS ON </p><p>"OTHER ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS" TO PROVIDE SPIRITUAL AND </p><p>MATERIAL AIDE TO THE ALGERIAN DJIHAD.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THE LIDD MIGHT LOOK TO THE IRANIANS AND OTHERS FOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  WE RECALL THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE </p><p>DENOUNCED PUBLICLY THE GIA\'S CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>INDISCRIMINATE CAR BOMBINGS IN ALGERIA AS THE WORK </p><p>OF ALGERIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE GIA\'S MURDER OF MOHAMED SAID AND HIS </p><p>FOLLOWERS IN LATE 1995 SPURRED A NUMBER OF LOCAL GIA </p><p>MEMBERS TO QUIT THE GROUP IN EARLY 1996 (SEE REFS C, </p><p>D).  AN APPARENTLY GENUINE "AL-DJIHAD" BULLETIN FROM </p><p>THE SPRING OF 1996 CLAIMED THAT THESE GROUPS </p><p>EXTENDED FROM THE LARBAA AND MEDEA REGIONS SOUTH OF </p><p>THE CAPITAL (THE MEDEA GROUP LED BY ALI BENHADJER) </p><p>TO BOUSAADA ON THE HIGH PLATEAU.  WE REPORTED LAST </p><p>YEAR THAT SOME OF THESE GIA SPLINTERS WERE </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO MOHAMED SAID AND HAD REGROUPED UNDER </p><p>THE BANNER OF THE OLD DJAZAIR\'IST AL-FIDA GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  IN THE FEBRUARY 1997 LIDD COMMUNIQUE, THE </p><p>FOURTH SIGNER IS "AHMED ABOU EL-FIDA," SAID TO BE </p><p>THE COMMANDER OF THE AL-FIDA.  (COMMENT:  WE DO NOT </p><p>KNOW EXACTLY WHO AHMED ABOU AL-FIDA IS.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO A WELL-INFORMED JOURNALIST, WHO HAS SOURCES IN </p><p>THE ALGERIAN SECURITY SERVICES, HIS REAL NAME IS </p><p>ABDELLAH SEDOUKI (NFI).  WE HAVE OBTAINED AN </p><p>APPARENTLY GENUINE COMMUNIQUE FROM AHMED ABOU </p><p>AL-FIDA CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JANUARY 28 </p><p>KILLING OF ABDELHAK BENHAMOUDA, PRESIDENT ZEROUAL\'S </p><p>ALLY.  END COMMENT.)  THE LIDD COMMUNIQUE, THUS, </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT AL-FIDA OF CENTRAL ALGERIA HAS </p><p>RETURNED FULL CIRCLE FROM THE GIA TO THE FIS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  IN ADDITION, THE LIDD\'S MAHFOUD RAHMANI </p><p>COMES FROM M\'SILA, WHILE YOUSSEF BOUBRAS COMES FROM </p><p>BOUIRA.  (A LAWYER IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH FIS </p><p>LEADERS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE ALGERIA TOLD US JANUARY </p><p>28 OF A MID-JANUARY AMBUSH AGAINST THE ALGERIAN ARMY </p><p>WHICH KILLED DOZENS OF SOLDIERS IN BOUIRA.)  THUS, </p><p>THE LIDD SUGGESTS, ALBEIT TENTATIVELY, THAT ARMED </p><p>GROUPS LOYAL TO THE FIS NOW EXTEND FROM MEDEA EAST </p><p>TO BOUIRA AND PERHAPS EVEN TO M\'SILA AND BOUSAADA TO </p><p>THE SOUTHEAST. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>8.  (S)  (COMMENT:  IF/IF THIS IS TRUE, IT IS A </p><p>DIFFERENT PICTURE OF THE ARMED GROUPS FROM WHAT WE </p><p>SAW IN LATE 1994 AND THROUGHOUT 1995 AND 1996. </p><p>DURING THAT TIME, THERE WERE FEW SIGNS THAT THE FIS, </p><p>DEFINED AS THE LEADERSHIP OF ABASSI MADANI AND ALI </p><p>BENHADJ, HAD THE LOYALTY OF ANY ARMED GROUPS OUTSIDE </p><p>THE ISLAMIC SALVATION ARMY (AIS) GROUPS IN THE </p><p>JIJEL/SKIKDA REGION IN THE EAST AND THE </p><p>RELIZANE/MASCARA/SIDI BEL ABBES REGION IN THE WEST. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANOTHER GIA SPLIT:  AL-BAQAOUN </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE OTHER </p><p>IN-FIGHTING INSIDE THE GIA DURING THE PAST YEAR (SEE </p><p>REF D ABOUT WESTERN ALGERIA, FOR EXAMPLE).  NOTABLY, </p><p>GIA GROUPS AROUND CHLEF IN DECEMBER 1996 REPORTEDLY </p><p>REBELLED AGAINST THE CORE GIA UNDER ANTAR ZOUABRI </p><p>AND ELECTED A FORMER FIGHTER FROM AFGHANISTAN NAMED </p><p>SLIMANE MAHERZI AS THEIR LEADER, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>SOMETIMES WELL-INFORMED LONDON NEWSPAPER ASH-SHARQ </p><p>AL-AWSET (REF E).  MAHERZI, WHOSE WAR NAME IS </p><p>ABDERAHMANE ABOU DJAMIL, WAS ALSO REPORTED TO BE THE </p><p>LEADER OF AL-BAQAOUN \'ALA AL-\'AHD, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>OFTEN WELL-INFORMED LONDON NEWSPAPER AL-HAYAT (REF </p><p>F).  ACCORDING TO THESE LONDON PRESS SOURCES, ABOU </p><p>DJAMIL\'S BASE OF OPERATION IS WEST OF THE CAPITAL </p><p>BETWEEN CHLEF AND BLIDA. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  WHILE MAHERZI APPEARS TO HAVE SPLIT WITH </p><p>THE GIA UNDER ZOUABRI, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF HE HAS </p><p>ALIGNED WITH BENHADJER\'S LIDD AGAINST THEIR COMMON </p><p>ENEMIES, ZOUABRI AND THE ALGERIAN ARMY.  A </p><p>WELL-INFORMED ALGERIAN JOURNALIST ASSERTED THAT </p><p>AL-BAQAOUN IS PART OF THE LEAGUE (SEE REF B).  THE </p><p>FRENCH EMBASSY PROVIDED US A COPY OF A POSSIBLY </p><p>GENUINE JANUARY 1997 AL-BAQAOUN COMMUNIQUE WHICH </p><p>CONFIRMED AL-FIDA KILLED ABDELHAK BENHAMOUDA AND </p><p>CALLED AL-FIDA THE FAITHFUL\'S "COLLEAGUES."  THE </p><p>COMMUNIQUE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE MURDER AND THE </p><p>AL-FIDA CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY; IT SUGGESTS THAT </p><p>THE TWO GROUPS MIGHT BE IN REGULAR CONTACT.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE SEPTEMBER 1996 AL-BAQAOUN COMMUNIQUE </p><p>REFERS TO THE UNJUSTIFIED GIA KILLING OF "PREACHERS </p><p>AND MOUJAHIDINE"--LANGUAGE IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE </p><p>AL-FIDA AND THE LIDD IN FEBRUARY 1997.  MOREOVER, </p><p>THE OATH IN THE GROUP\'S NAME IS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, </p><p>ONE OF LOYALTY TO MADANI AND BENHADJ, JUST AS THAT </p><p>EXPRESSED BY BENHADJER (SEE REFS B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  NOT ALL SIGNS SUGGEST THAT AL-BAQAOUN </p><p>DEFINITELY HAS JOINED WITH AL-FIDA, AND HENCE TO THE </p><p>LIDD.  THE AL-BAQAOUN COMMUNIQUE ABOUT BENHAMOUDA </p><p>WAS IN FRENCH, WHICH MADE SOME OBSERVERS WHO SAW IT </p><p>IMMEDIATELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THE COMMUNIQUE WAS A </p><p>GOVERNMENT-PRODUCED FAKE.  WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED AN </p><p>APPARENTLY GENUINE FEBRUARY 1997 AL-BAQAOUN </p><p>COMMUNIQUE, IN ARABIC, WHICH STRONGLY DENOUNCES </p><p>THOSE WHO WOULD NEGOTIATE WITH THE ALGERIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE SEPTEMBER 1996 COMMUNIQUE DID SO AS </p><p>WELL.  SINCE MADANI AND BENHADJ DID TALK WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN 1994 AND 1995, ABOU DJAMIL\'S LOYALTY </p><p>TO THEM WOULD HAVE TO BE QUESTIONABLE IF EITHER </p><p>COMMUNIQUE IS GENUINE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  MEANWHILE, THE FIS LEADERSHIP IN EXILE HAS </p><p>UNDERGONE OTHER TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE PAST MONTH. </p><p>MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT EXPELLED KHEIREDINE KHERBANE </p><p>FROM ITS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  OUR FIS LAWYER SOURCE </p><p>TOLD US MARCH 10 THAT KHERBANE TOO OFTEN STRAYED </p><p>PUBLICLY FROM THE OFFICIAL FIS LINE.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>HE SAID, KHERBANE\'S CONTACTS IN LONDON WITH PERSONS </p><p>THOUGHT LINKED TO THE GIA MADE KEBIR AND OTHER FIS </p><p>OFFICIALS NERVOUS.  HE ADDED THAT THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE HAS APPOINTED ABDELKRIM OULD ADDA, A </p><p>PROFESSOR ORIGINALLY FROM MOSTAGANEM AND A KEBIR </p><p>AIDE, TO BE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\'S SPOKESMAN. </p><p>THIS SOURCE BELIEVES THE CHANGES TO THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE AIM AT CONSOLIDATING KEBIR\'S AUTHORITY </p><p>OVER THE COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  COMPARED TO ANALYSES OF ALGERIA\'S </p><p>SPLINTERED ARMED ISLAMIST GROUPS, ECONOMICS IS AN </p><p>EXTREMELY PRECISE SCIENCE.  LOCAL RIVALRIES, </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES, AND THE GROUPS\' INSTINCTIVE </p><p>PENCHANT FOR SECRECY AND NAME CHANGES, NOT TO </p><p>MENTION FAKE COMMUNIQUES AND OTHER PRESSURE FROM THE </p><p>ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT, MAKE ALL JUDGEMENTS HIGHLY </p><p>PRONE TO ERROR.  NONETHELESS, WE HAZARD THAT THE </p><p>FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE RUTHLESS TACTICS OF ANTAR ZOUABRI AND THE </p><p>"CORE" GIA HAVE ALIENATED SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THE </p><p>GROUP\'S MEMBERS; </p><p> </p><p>--  THERE ARE NEW (OR RENEWED) GROUPS IN CENTRAL </p><p>ALGERIA WHO EITHER BY COMMUNIQUE OR BY THEIR VERY </p><p>NAME HAVE LEFT THE GIA AND AGAIN CLAIM LOYALTY TO </p><p>THE TRADITIONAL FIS LEADERSHIP OF ABASSI MADANI AND </p><p>ALI BENHADJ; </p><p> </p><p>--  THESE GROUPS\' LOYALTY TO THE TRADITIONAL FIS </p><p>LEADERSHIP, CREATES A NEW ALIGNMENT OF ISLAMIST </p><p>FORCES BOTH IN CENTRAL ALGERIA, AND PERHAPS EVEN </p><p>NATIONALLY, COMPARED TO THE DISPOSITION OF 1994 OR </p><p>1995; </p><p> </p><p>--  IN ADDITION, THE FIS APPEARS TO STILL HAVE THE </p><p>LOYALTY OF THE ISLAMIC SALVATION ARMY, LOCATED IN </p><p>EASTERN AND WESTERN ALGERIA; </p><p> </p><p>--  IT STILL SEEMS TOO EARLY TO KNOW IF EFFORTS BY </p><p>GROUPS LIKE ALI BENHADJER\'S LIDD TO MERGE OR ALLY </p><p>WITH OTHER ARMED GROUPS, LIKE AL-BAQAOUN, HAVE, IN </p><p>FACT, SUCCEEDED; </p><p> </p><p>--  EFFORTS TO UNIFY ARE SIGNIFICANT MAINLY IN TERMS </p><p>OF POLITICAL ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER;  AND </p><p> </p><p>--  TENTATIVE EFFORTS TO UNIFY THEIR RANKS DOES NOT </p><p>MEAN THESE ARMED GROUPS ARE STRONGER MILITARILY; </p><p>RATHER, THEIR EFFORTS MAY BE IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>TREMENDOUS PRESSURE FROM THE "CORE" GIA AND THE </p><p>ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  WHILE THE LIDD, AL-FIDA AND AL-BAQAOUN </p><p>COULD BE LOYAL TO THE FIS AS PERSONIFIED BY ABASSI </p><p>MADANI AND ALI BENHADJ, NOWHERE HAVE WE SEEN THEM </p><p>EXPRESS LOYALTY TO THE FIS LEADERSHIP IN EXILE UNDER </p><p>REBAH KEBIR.  (INDEED, SOME OF THE AL-BAQAOUN </p><p>COMMUNIQUES IMPLICITLY ATTACK THE EXILES.)  THUS, </p><p>THE EXILE LEADERSHIP IS UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO DO </p><p>MUCH TO REDUCE VIOLENCE.  EVEN THE EXTENT OF MADANI </p><p>AND BENHADJ\'S ABILITY TO REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY THE </p><p>ONGOING VIOLENCE IS QUESTIONABLE (AFTER ALL, THESE </p><p>GROUPS MAY USE THEM AS A RALLYING POINT ONLY BECAUSE </p><p>THEY ARE IN NO POSITION TO GIVE ORDERS). </p><p> </p><p>NEUMANN </p><p></p></div>
