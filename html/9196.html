<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001899 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, AF, CA, Afghanistan </p><p>SUBJECT: ISAF: CANADIAN DEFENSE MINISTER\'S VISIT TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 1654 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Canadian Defense Minister John McCallum </p><p>visited Kabul June 23-24 in advance of Canada\'s participation </p><p>in ISAF IV and V.  McCallum met with Afghan President Karzai </p><p>and Defense Minister Khan, among others, and visited the camp </p><p>being set up for approximately 1,800 Canadian troops.  While </p><p>mindful of the security risks, McCallum and Canadian MGEN </p><p>Andrew Leslie, who will be ISAF\'s Deputy Commander, want to </p><p>increase ISAF\'s visibility in Kabul and its interaction with </p><p>the Afghan Government.  They do not, however, believe it is </p><p>feasible to expand ISAF\'s role beyond Kabul without a huge </p><p>infusion of troops.  Canada is also concerned that, with NATO </p><p>taking on the leadership of ISAF, we not lose sight of the </p><p>need for another key national contributor as Germany scales </p><p>back its forces.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) McCallum\'s Executive Assistant Gene Lang and Director </p><p>of Communications Randy Milik, both of whom accompanied </p><p>McCallum to Kabul, debriefed us on the Minister\'s visit. </p><p>Lang and Milik told us that Karzai was impressive, </p><p>charismatic and optimistic about Afghanistan\'s future. </p><p>Karzai reaffirmed that he was committed to meeting the June </p><p>2004 deadline for nationwide elections.  UN Under Secretary </p><p>Jean Arnaud, who also met with McCallum, was quite </p><p>pessimistic about holding to the election timetable. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Defense Minister Khan was more hospitable than </p><p>expected, and appreciative of the Canadian contributions to </p><p>OEF and ISAF.  Lang and Milik said that Khan delivered a </p><p>"well-rehearsed" message about his cooperation with Karzai. </p><p>McCallum stressed reform of the military and </p><p>disarmament/demobilization/reconstruction (DDR).  Khan </p><p>concurred that DDR was key, but said it was being delayed by </p><p>lack of funding.  Lang noted the huge disparity between </p><p>Khan\'s militia, numbering approximately 70,000, and the </p><p>10,000 personnel that have been trained thus far for the </p><p>Afghan Army. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a meeting at the Interior Ministry, McCallum also </p><p>discussed the policing challenge in Kabul where, acording to </p><p>Milik, there are only 7,000 police with little training in a </p><p>city of some 3 million.  RCMP officers recently visited Kabul </p><p>and decided against setting up a training program, but </p><p>McCallum told his Afghan interlocutors that he would revisit </p><p>this issue in Ottawa. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MGEN Leslie, who joined McCallum for his meetings, </p><p>wants to build stronger linkages between ISAF and the Afghan </p><p>Government.  While the German forces have done an excellent </p><p>job overall, the Canadians believe ISAF can and should be </p><p>more visible, and do more to advise and assist the Afghani </p><p>Government, possibly including liaison officers.  The </p><p>Canadians are not, however, looking to expand the ISAF\'s role </p><p>beyond Kabul.  Lang and Milik told us that the current ISAF </p><p>contingent of roughly 6,000 troops is barely enough to do its </p><p>mission in Kabul, and that tens of thousands of troops would </p><p>be needed to do the same job country-wide.  They estimated </p><p>that 80-90% of the people in Kabul strongly supported ISAF, </p><p>but said that some Al Qaida and Taliban elements are also </p><p>present, including among the large number of refugees flowing </p><p>into the capital. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Lang told us that there are currently 250 Canadian </p><p>Forces (CF) personnel in Kabul, and that the deployment of </p><p>equipment and 1,800 total CF personnel is on track for </p><p>completion in mid-August.  The Canadian Forces are acquiring </p><p>four low-flying UAVs (the CF\'s first, prompted by this </p><p>mission) that they will use to help monitor the neighborhoods </p><p>of Kabul.  These Canadian UAVs are expected to arrive in </p><p>October, until which time the Germans will keep their UAVs in </p><p>place. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Canada is concerned about ensuring adequate ISAF troop </p><p>strength in 2004, especially as Germany is eager to reduce </p><p>its presence.  Lang told us that the CF (and most other NATO </p><p>militaries) do not have the "skill set" needed to run the </p><p>Kabul airport, and that they would encourage Germany to </p><p>continue in this role.  But another NATO country would have </p><p>to step up to the plate as a major contributor in 2004, and </p><p>most likely targets (UK, France, Italy, Spain) have major </p><p>deployments elsewhere and/or have resisted participating in </p><p>ISAF.  Lang and Milik expected that senior U.S. officials, </p><p>such as Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, would need to twist arms </p><p>to find a suitable contributor. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
