(C)  VARIOUS UN ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY CIVPOL, </p><p>ARE STRENGTHENING THEIR EFFORTS TO MONITOR AND </p><p>INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS FOR SERBS IN "SECTOR WEST." </p><p>MANY UN OFFICIALS SAY THEY STILL SUSPECT THERE WERE AT </p><p>LEAST SOME HUMAN RIGHTS TRANSGRESSIONS BY CROATIAN </p><p>FORCES DURING AND AFTER THE MAY 1 OFFENSIVE, AND ARE </p><p>UNEASY THAT LITTLE SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OF CROATIAN </p><p>WRONGDOING HAS TURNED UP SO FAR. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (LOU) EMBASSY\'S INVESTIGATION OF CROAT TREATMENT OF </p><p>MILITARY DETAINEES AND CIVILIANS CONTINUES TODAY WITH </p><p>POLOFFS\' RETURN VISIT TO BJELOVAR (SITE OF ONE </p><p>DETENTION CENTER, WHERE WE EXPECT TO INTERVIEW SOME OF </p><p>THE DETAINEES); STARA GRADISKA TO CHECK THE STATUS OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01824  01 OF 02  111828Z </p><p>THE TOWN AND POSSIBLY INTERVIEW SOME OF THE BOSNIA- </p><p>BOUND SERBS; AND OTHER LOCATIONS.  OUR REQUEST TO THE </p><p>UN TO BE ABLE TO INTERVIEW SOME OF THE NEPALI TROOPS IN </p><p>THE AREA WHO MIGHT HAVE WITNESSED ATROCITIES HAS BEEN </p><p>TURNED DOWN BY UNCRO HEADQUARTERS, ALTHOUGH WE WERE </p><p>TOLD WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INTERVIEW THEM HERE IN ZAGREB. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON MAY 11, E.J. FLYNN (PROTECT) OF THE UN </p><p>CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (MAZOWIECKI COMMISSION) IN </p><p>ZAGREB TOLD US HE IS TAKING A CAUTIOUS ATTITUDE ABOUT </p><p>GIVING THE GOC A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>GROUNDS.  ALTHOUGH ADMITTING THE UN DOES NOT TAKE THE </p><p>ACCUSATIONS OUT OF BELGRADE ABOUT A MASSACRE AT THE </p><p>STARA GRADISKA BRIDGE TERRIBLY SERIOUSLY, HE SAID THERE </p><p>WERE "A NUMBER" OF REPORTS OF INCIDENTS WHICH SUGGESTED </p><p>THE CROATIAN ARMY (HV) MIGHT HAVE KILLED CIVILIANS </p><p>DURING THEIR INITIAL OFFENSIVE.  FLYNN FOUND "SUSPECT" </p><p>THE FACT THAT THERE HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE INFORMATION SO </p><p>FAR ABOUT SERB CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THE AREA.  THE </p><p>ONLY SPECIFIC INCIDENT HE RAISED, HOWEVER, WAS ONE THAT </p><p>VELJO DJAKULA RAISED WITH THE AMBASSADOR MAY 8, IN </p><p>WHICH SIX OF SEVEN PEOPLE TRYING TO ESCAPE PAKRAC IN A </p><p>TRUCK AT NIGHT HAD APPARENTLY BEEN KILLED BY CROATIAN </p><p>FIRE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE UN CENTRE ALSO HAS "VARIOUS" REPORTS OF </p><p>MISTREATMENT AND PHYSICAL ABUSE OF MILITARY DETAINEES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AT THE VARAZDIN CENTER.  (NOTE:  EMBASSY </p><p>HAS NOT YET VISITED THE VARAZDIN CENTER BUT WILL BE </p><p>DOING SO IN THE NEAR FUTURE.)  FLYNN TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL WAS PLANNING TO SEND AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01824  01 OF 02  111828Z </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO CROATIA NEXT WEEK; IT WOULD LOOK </p><p>AT THE QUESTION OF THE ROCKET ATTACKS ON ZAGREB, AS </p><p>WELL AS QUESTIONS OF CROAT TREATMENT OF SERBS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (LOU)  UNCIVPOL COMMISSION SVEN FREDRIKSSON TOLD US </p><p>MAY 11 THAT HE HAD ALREADY ADDED 70 ADDITIONAL CIVPOL </p><p>OFFICERS IN FORMER SECTOR WEST, BRINGING THE TOTAL </p><p>PRESENCE CURRENTLY TO 130.  HE EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO </p><p>ADD 30 TO 40 MORE AS NEW INCOMING PERSONNEL WERE </p><p>TRAINED.  CIVPOL IS CONTINUING AND EVEN AUGMENTING ITS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY EXISTING PRESENCE IN "THE NORTHERN PART OF </p><p>SECTOR WEST" (NOTE: THAT IS THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF </p><p>THE FORMALLY DEFINED "UNPA WEST" WHICH HAS IN PRACTICAL </p><p>TERMS BEEN CONTROLLED BY THE CROATS SINCE BEFORE </p><p>UNPROFOR FORCES ARRIVED IN CROATIA.  BECAUSE A SMALL </p><p>SERB MINORITY REMAINS IN THE AREA, THERE IS A </p><p>LEGITIMATE "REASSURANCE" ROLE THERE FOR UNCIVPOL).  THE </p><p>UN THOUGHT ITS HEIGHTENED VISIBILITY IN THIS AREA WOULD </p><p>BE USEFUL; CIVPOL HAS ORDERS TO VISIT "EVERY VILLAGE </p><p>EVERY DAY." </p><p> </p><p>6.

ROVING) PATROLS </p><p>BUT WOULD ALSO HAVE STATIONARY POSTS IN THE MOST </p><p>SENSITIVE AREAS.  CIVPOL HAD RETURNED TO OKUCANI MAY 10 </p><p>AND WOULD BE ABLE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION THERE WITH A </p><p>TOTAL OF 16 OFFICERS.  IN ALL AREAS, THE CIVPOL VIEWED </p><p>ITS MISSION AS GATHERING SOUND, VERIFIABLE INFORMATION </p><p>ON POSSIBLE CRIMES AND INCIDENTS, AND REASSURANCE OF </p><p>THE MINORITY POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  CIVPOL NOW HAS ALMOST COMPLETE FREEDOM OF </p><p>MOVEMENT AND HAS FOUND THE CROATS EXTREMELY </p><p>COOPERATIVE.  FREDRIKSSON SAID THERE HAD BEEN "ONLY" </p><p>THREE CASES IN WHICH CROATIAN OFFICIALS HAD SOUGHT TO </p><p>DENY ACCESS (AND EXPLAINED THE WORD "ONLY" BY SAYING, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01824  02 OF 02  111827Z </p><p>"I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED MANY MORE").  WHEN MILITARY </p><p>POLICE IN ONE VILLAGE NEAR PAKRAC DENIED CIVPOL ACCESS, </p><p>THE CROATIAN CIVILIAN POLICE AUTHORITIES ON THE SCENE </p><p>HAD GONE TO HIGHER AUTHORITY AND GOT THE MILITARY </p><p>POLICE DECISION REVERSED, ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE GOC </p><p>HAD ORDERED "FULL COOPERATION WITH THE UN."  WHEN </p><p>CIVPOL OFFICERS WHO RETURNED TO THEIR FORMER OFFICES IN </p><p>OKUCANI FOUND THEM OCCUPIED BY THE HV -- BUT THE </p><p>CROATIAN SOLDIERS DID RELINQUISH THE SPACE ON REQUEST. </p><p>(ALL THE OFFICE EQUIPMENT WAS MISSING, WHETHER TAKEN BY </p><p>SERBS OR CROATS, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY).  ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, CIVPOL PERSONNEL INVESTIGATING A REPORT OF </p><p>A GRAVE DESECRATION IN OKUCANI GOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE </p><p>THAT A GRAVE APPEARED TO BE OPEN, AND TO DETECT A </p><p>"POWERFUL ODOR," BUT WERE TURNED AWAY BY MILITARY </p><p>POLICE.  (THIS INCIDENT WILL BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  FREDRIKSSON SEEMED TO SHARE FLYNN\'S VIEW THAT </p><p>MORE INCIDENTS WOULD COME TO LIGHT.  HE SAID CIVPOL HAD </p><p>FIELDED "LOTS OF COMPLAINTS," AND FELT THERE WAS NO </p><p>DOUBT THAT "WRONGDOING" HAD OCCURRED, THOUGH CIVPOL HAD </p><p>DETECTED NO PATTERN OF ABUSE BUT RATHER, ISOLATED </p><p>INCIDENTS.  THE UN, HE THOUGHT, NEEDED TO "FLOOD THE </p><p>AREA" WITH OBSERVERS TO DEVELOP "QUALITY INFORMATION" </p><p>TO BE ABLE TO CONFIRM OR REFUTE REPORTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATIONS.  FREDRIKSSON ALSO ECHOED A POINT WE HAVE </p><p>HEARD FROM SOME CROATIAN CONTACTS, I.E. THAT THE </p><p>CROATIAN POLICE WERE TURNING FOR ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>ADMINISTERING THE AREA TO PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE "DOMOBRAN" (LOCAL MILITIA) IN THE AREA BEFORE </p><p>THE WAR.  THESE, HE THOUGHT, WERE "EXACTLY THE WRONG </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01824  02 OF 02  111827Z </p><p>PEOPLE TO USE" BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HARBOR GRUDGES.  HE </p><p>HAD EXPRESSED HIS MISGIVING TO THE CROATIAN POLICE, WHO </p><p>COUNTERED THAT THESE PEOPLE\'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA </p><p>MADE THEM INVALUABLE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  IN SUM, THERE IS A SENSE OF UNEASE AMONG </p><p>UN PERSONNEL THAT, DESPITE THE LACK OF EVIDENCE SO FAR </p><p>ON THE GROUND, SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS REMAIN </p><p>TO BE UNCOVERED.  ECHOING THIS ATTITUDE, UN CIVIL </p><p>AFFAIRS CHIEF FOR CROATIA JAQUE GRINBERG TOLD POLOFF </p><p>MAY 11 THAT THE ORIGINAL MOVE IN NEW YORK TOWARD </p><p>CENSURE OF THE CROATIAN ACTION HAD "NOT BEEN </p><p>PREMATURE," IMPLYING THAT UN\'S JUDGMENT WOULD YET BE </p><p>VINDICATED.  WE BELIEVE THERE ARE CERTAINLY INCIDENTS </p><p>WHICH REQUIRE FULL INVESTIGATION, AND HAVE MADE CLEAR </p><p>TO UN OFFICIALS THAT OUR OWN EFFORTS WILL LIKEWISE </p><p>EXPLORE ALL AVENUES TO ASCERTAIN THE FACTS. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
