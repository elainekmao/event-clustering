<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 007234 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/PPD (MCGUINNESS, CBOURGEOIS), R, NEA/ARN, </p><p>NEA/P (ACASPER) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, KISL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: RAMADAN 2002: AMMAN </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  EMBASSY AMMAN UNDERTOOK A NUMBER OF SPECIAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF RAMADAN AIMED AT </p><p>REINFORCING A MESSAGE OF RESPECT FOR ISLAM.  SOMEWHAT TO OUR </p><p>SURPRISE IN THESE TENSE TIMES, OUR JORDANIAN CONTACTS </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN GREAT NUMBERS AT OUR EMBASSY RAMADAN EVENTS, </p><p>INCLUDING TWO IFTARS, A CULTURAL EVENING OF POETRY AND </p><p>MUSIC, AND OUTREACH EFFORTS HIGHLIGHTING RAMADAN AND EID </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF SENIOR USG POLICYMAKERS.  THE SUCCESS OF THESE </p><p>EFFORTS APPEARS TO CONFIRM THE VIEW THAT WHILE MANY OF OUR </p><p>CONTACTS, LIKE MOST JORDANIANS, ARE ANGERED BY SPECIFIC US </p><p>POLICIES IN THE REGION, THEY REMAIN OPEN TO ENGAGEMENT ON A </p><p>PERSONAL BASIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. PA AMMAN PLANNED A NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIONAL EVENTS </p><p>DURING THE ISLAMIC MONTH OF RAMADAN WITH MIXED EXPECTATIONS. </p><p>WHILE THESE ACTIVITIES IN YEARS PAST HAD PROVEN SUCCESSFUL </p><p>IN JORDAN, THEY HAD GENERALLY INSPIRED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF </p><p>BACKGROUND NOISE - AN OCCASIONAL NEGATIVE EDITORIAL, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE.  WOULD OUR CONTACTS BOYCOTT OR POLITELY DECLINE OUR </p><p>INVITATIONS THIS YEAR, GIVEN THE STRONG HOSTILITY EXPRESSED </p><p>IN THE MEDIA AND BY MANY OF OUR CONTACTS TO U.S. POLICY IN </p><p>THE REGION?  THE FIRST TEST CAME NOVEMBER 20, WHEN PA </p><p>ARRANGED AN IFTAR HOSTED BY AMBASSADOR GNEHM FOR CONTACTS IN </p><p>THE MEDIA SECTOR.  2002 MARKED THE THIRD YEAR FOR THIS EVENT </p><p>FOR PA AMMAN.  WE BOOKED THE SAME RESTAURANT AS LAST YEAR, </p><p>AND INVITED 160 JOURNALISTS, PUBLISHERS AND OTHER MEDIA </p><p>CONTACTS.  APART FROM A VERY FEW INVITEES WHO WERE OUT OF </p><p>TOWN, A FULL HOUSE TURNED OUT FOR THE EVENT.  WE FOLLOWED </p><p>THIS EVENT A WEEK LATER WITH A SECOND IFTAR HOSTED BY THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR FOR RETURNED JORDANIAN PARTICIPANTS IN US </p><p>EXCHANGE PROGRAMS.  AGAIN, APART FROM A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF </p><p>REGRETS, THE EVENT WAS VERY WELL ATTENDED.  THE GUEST LIST </p><p>FOR THE SECOND IFTAR INCLUDED A GROUP OF RECENTLY-RETURNED </p><p>ISLAMIC SHARIA LAW FACULTY, INDICATING A WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>ENGAGE AMONG EVEN OUR MOST CHALLENGING AUDIENCES.  BOTH </p><p>IFTARS WERE MARKED BY A COLLEGIAL ATMOSPHERE, AND AT BOTH, </p><p>AMBASSADOR GNEHM OFFERED WELL-RECEIVED WELCOMING REMARKS IN </p><p>ARABIC.  POST DISTRIBUTED AT THESE EVENTS MORE THAN 200 </p><p>COPIES OF THE "MUSLIM LIFE IN AMERICA" BOOKLETS, AS WELL AS </p><p>COPIES IN ARABIC OF THE PRESIDENT\'S RAMADAN GREETING TO </p><p>MUSLIMS AROUND THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>3. SEPARATELY, CAO HOSTED A RAMADAN EVENING OF ARABIC MUSIC </p><p>AND POETRY FOR ROUGHLY 30 CULTURAL CONTACTS OF THE EMBASSY. </p><p>AGAIN, A FULL HOUSE OF YOUNG JORDANIAN WRITERS, ARTISTS AND </p><p>MUSICIANS MIXED CASUALLY AND ENJOYED AN EVENING THAT </p><p>INCLUDED LIVELY DISCUSSION ON CROSS-CULTURAL COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>AND RELATED SUBJECTS.  SEVERAL INVITEES EXPRESSED PLEASANT </p><p>SURPRISE THAT A TRADITIONAL RAMADAN EVENING OF THIS KIND </p><p>COULD BE HELD AT THE HOUSE OF AN AMERICAN DIPLOMAT, AS </p><p>RAMADAN EVENTS AROUND AMMAN HAVE INCREASINGLY MOVED AWAY </p><p>FROM SUCH TRADITIONS IN FAVOR OF MORE COMMERCIAL PURSUITS </p><p>LIKE PAID ENTERTAINMENT AND LAVISH RESTAURANT-HOPPING.  THE </p><p>ANNUAL FULBRIGHT IFTAR, PRIMARILY FOR AMERICAN SCHOLARS, </p><p>SIMILARLY DREW A GOOD TURNOUT OF JORDANIANS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY. </p><p> </p><p>4. POST SOUGHT WIDE PLACEMENT IN LOCAL MEDIA FOR RAMADAN- </p><p>RELATED STATEMENTS AND ACTIVITIES OF SENIOR USG POLICY </p><p>MAKERS.  ALL JORDANIAN DAILIES FEATURED PROMINENT COVERAGE </p><p>OF PRESIDENT BUSH\'S RAMADAN GREETING TO MUSLIMS AROUND THE </p><p>WORLD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH.  ALTHOUGH JORDAN\'S </p><p>NEWSPAPERS DID NOT PUBLISH DECEMBER 6-7, TELEVISION NEWS </p><p>CARRIED THE PRESIDENT\'S EID ACTIVITIES AT THE ISLAMIC CENTER </p><p>IN WASHINGTON.  POST ALSO FEATURED ON THE EMBASSY WEBSITE </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL\'S EID GREETINGS TO THE JORDANIAN PM AND FM, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AS WELL AS NSA RICE\'S IFTAR WITH FEMALE MUSLIM LAWYERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OTHER PA ACTIVITIES INCLUDED PREPARATION OF A "RAMADAN </p><p>SPEAKER\'S KIT."   THIS SET OF WASHINGTON FILE AND OTHER </p><p>MATERIALS PROVIDED INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE AND </p><p>MEANING OF RAMADAN, AS WELL AS GUIDANCE ON KEY AND </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES OF CURRENT INTEREST WHICH WE </p><p>DISTRIBUTED TO OFFICERS THROUGHOUT THE MISSION TO PREPARE </p><p>THEM FOR CONVERSATIONS DURING THEIR BUSY IFTAR SCHEDULES. </p><p>PA AMMAN ALSO SECURED COPYRIGHT FROM THE US POSTAL SERVICE </p><p>FOR THE IMAGE ON THE POSTAL SERVICE\'S 2002 "EID GREETINGS </p><p>STAMP" WHICH WAS USED AS THE COVER FOR A GREETING CARD SENT </p><p>TO 600 EMBASSY CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT: WHILE MOST OF OUR CONTACTS REMAIN DEEPLY AND </p><p>VOCALLY SKEPTICAL OF U.S. POLICIES TOWARD THE ISRAELI- </p><p>PALESTINIAN CONFLICT AND IRAQ, THEY WERE ALSO PREPARED TO </p><p>SEPARATE THESE MISGIVINGS FROM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONAL </p><p>CONTACT WITH EMBASSY OFFICERS.  IT MAY BE THAT THIS IS </p><p>SIMPLY A MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP THAT </p><p>MARKS RAMADAN IN JORDAN, BUT WE BELIEVE IT ALSO CONFIRMS THE </p><p>NOTION THAT WHILE U.S. POLICIES IN THE REGION MAY NOT BE </p><p>VIEWED FAVORABLY, MANY JORDANIANS CONTINUE TO VALUE THEIR </p><p>PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AMERICANS </p><p>WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE MISSION.  IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR </p><p>GUESTS MAY HAVE SEEN THE IFTARS AS A CHANCE TO SATISFY THEIR </p><p>CURIOSITY ABOUT WHAT THE EMBASSY IS UP TO, GIVEN THE RECENT </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE AND THE RUMORS OF </p><p>IMMINENT MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ.  WHATEVER THE </p><p>MOTIVES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE JORDANIAN RESPONSE TO SUCH </p><p>SOCIAL AND CULTURAL EVENTS UNDERLINES THE VALUE OF AN ACTIVE </p><p>OUTREACH PROGRAM IN SUSTAINING THE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP </p><p>DURING TENSE TIMES.  BERRY </p><p></p></div>
