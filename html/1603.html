(C) ON MARCH 22, ECONOFF MET WITH COLLIN CLOETE, VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT FOR COMMODITIES OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>UNION (CFU), TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS OF THE CFU SPECIAL </p><p>CONGRESS HELD THE PREVIOUS DAY.  THE ISSUE OF REPLACING </p><p>THE CURRENT CFU LEADERSHIP (REFS A, B AND C) WAS NOT </p><p>RAISED AT THE CONGRESS, BECAUSE THE MEMBERSHIP WAS </p><p>UNITED BEHIND THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP.  NICK SWANEPOEL, A </p><p>FORMER CFU PRESIDENT WHO HAD ENGAGED IN SECRET, </p><p>UNSANCTIONED NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON THE LAND ISSUE (REF B), WAS GIVEN THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE CONGRESS, FOLLOWING WHICH IT </p><p>WAS DETERMINED THAT HE WILL PROCEED WITH HIS EFFORTS TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOZ IN A MODIFIED FASHION WITH THE </p><p>BACKING OF THE CFU.  THERE WAS A ONE AND A HALF HOUR </p><p>PRESENTATION OF A NEW PLAN BY THE CFU LEADERSHIP TO RE- </p><p>ENGAGE WITH THE GOZ ON THE ISSUES OF COMMERCIAL FARMING </p><p>AND LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT, WITH SHORT-, MEDIUM-, </p><p>AND LONG-TERM COMPONENTS.  THE CFU HAS HELD REPEATED </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FINANCE MINISTER, SIMBA MAKONI, ON </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE, AND THE MEMBERSHIP VIEWS HIM AS THE ONE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01102  01 OF 03  230533Z </p><p>PERSON IN THE GOZ WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO BRIDGE THE SHARP </p><p>DIVISION BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND THE GOZ. </p><p>THE CFU IS PACKAGING THE PLAN UNVEILED AT THE CONGRESS </p><p>FOR PRESENTATION TO THE GOZ, AND WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT </p><p>THE FARMERS WANT TO ESTABLISH A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ON </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE AND HAVE SET NO PRECONDITIONS FOR SUCH </p><p>TALKS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>A MORE PERFECT UNION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CLOETE REVEALED THAT THE CFU HELD A FULL COUNCIL </p><p>MEETING THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CONGRESS THAT WAS ATTENDED </p><p>BY SWANEPOEL.  SWANEPOEL AND THE COUNCIL MUTUALLY AGREED </p><p>THAT EVIDENCE OF SCHISMS WITHIN THE CFU AT THE CONGRESS </p><p>WOULD ONLY HURT COMMERCIAL FARMERS.  IT WAS AGREED THAT </p><p>SWANEPOEL WOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY AT THE CONGRESS </p><p>TO PRESENT AND EXPLAIN HIS UNSANCTIONED AND SECRETIVE </p><p>EFFORT TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE IMPASSE OVER LAND WITH </p><p>THE GOZ.  IT WAS ALSO AGREED THAT HE WOULD NOT RAISE THE </p><p>ISSUE OF REPLACING THE CURRENT CFU LEADERSHIP.  CLOETE </p><p>STATED THAT SWANEPOEL HAD NO CHOICE ON THE LATTER ISSUE </p><p>FOR TWO REASONS: THE ASSOCIATION OF JOHN BREDENKAMP (A </p><p>REPUTED ARMS DEALER WITH CLOSE TIES TO ZANU-PF) WITH HIS </p><p>SECRET TALKS HAD CAUSED MANY FARMERS TO QUESTION THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>REAL MOTIVES BEHIND SWANEPOEL\'S EFFORT, AND, THE RESULTS </p><p>OF THE CFU LEADERSHIP\'S CANVASSING OF OVER 1000 FARMERS </p><p>IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE CONGRESS, WHICH REVEALED NEAR </p><p>UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR THE INCUMBENT LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01102  01 OF 03  230533Z </p><p>3. (C) THE CONGRESS THE FOLLOWING DAY WENT VERY </p><p>SMOOTHLY.  THE CFU PRESIDENT, TIM HENWOOD, OPENED WITH A </p><p>15 MINUTE SPEECH, FOLLOWED BY SWANEPOEL WITH A 20 MINUTE </p><p>EXPOSITION ON HIS TALKS, FOLLOWED BY A ONE-AND-A-HALF </p><p>HOUR PRESENTATION OF THE CFU PLAN TO RE-ENGAGE THE GOZ </p><p>ON THE LAND ISSUE, WHICH WAS GIVEN BY CFU VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>FOR REGIONS, WILLIAM HUGHES.  AFTER THE PRESENTATION, </p><p>THERE WAS AN OPEN PERIOD OF Q & A\'S WITH THE LEADERSHIP </p><p>OVER THE PLAN, WITH A FEW QUESTIONS DIRECTED TO </p><p>SWANEPOEL REGARDING HIS DEALINGS WITH THE GOZ.  AT THE </p><p>END OF THE DAY-LONG CONGRESS THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS </p><p>CONSENSUS BY THE DELEGATES FOR THE LEADERSHIP TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSED PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>THE PLAN </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE PLAN PRESENTED BY THE CFU LEADERSHIP IS A </p><p>MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO ENGAGING THE GOZ ON THE </p><p>QUESTIONS OF THE FUTURE OF COMMERCIAL FARMING, LAND </p><p>REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT.  THE PLAN IS DIVIDED INTO </p><p>SHORT-, MEDIUM, AND LONG-TERM COMPONENTS DEALING WITH </p><p>ALL ASPECTS OF COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE AND LAND REFORM </p><p>AND RESETTLEMENT.

AS PART OF THE EFFORT TO </p><p>INTEGRATE MORE FULLY INTO PRESENT-DAY ZIMBABWE, THE CFU </p><p>WILL VIGOROUSLY PURSUE EFFORTS TO BROADEN ITS MEMBERSHIP </p><p>TO INCLUDE THE MEMBERS OF THE INDIGENOUS COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS UNION AND SMALL-HOLDER FARMERS ENGAGED IN </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMING, AND TO DEVELOP A NEW CFU </p><p>CONSTITUTION AND SYMBOLS THAT WILL BE PROPOSED FOR </p><p>ADOPTION AT THE AUGUST CONGRESS.  CLOETE STATED THAT THE </p><p>CFU IS NOW PREPARING THIS PLAN FOR FORMAL PRESENTATION </p><p>TO THE GOZ.  THE PLAN DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC FIGURES </p><p>LISTED AS GOALS, BECAUSE ZANU-PF CONTACTS TOLD THE CFU </p><p>LEADERSHIP THAT IT WAS BETTER TO LEAVE THIS OPEN FOR </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOZ.  CLOETE SAID THAT THERE WAS </p><p>NOT A SPECIFIC DATE FOR PRESENTING THE PLAN TO THE GOZ. </p><p>IT WILL BE PRESENTED AS SOON AS THE UNION HAS IT </p><p>PROPERLY PACKAGED FOR PRESENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>A ROLE FOR SWANEPOEL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01102  02 OF 03  230534Z </p><p>5. (C) THE CONGRESS ALSO AGREED THAT THERE WAS SOME </p><p>MERIT IN THE SECRET EFFORT THAT SWANEPOEL HAD BEGUN, AND </p><p>AUTHORIZED HIM TO SPEAK FOR THE UNION AND ITS MEMBERSHIP </p><p>IN HIS ROLE AS THE CO-CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC </p><p>CONSULTATIVE FORUM (NECF) TASK FORCE ON LAND.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO CLOETE, WHILE THIS IS A POSITION SWANEPOEL HAS FILLED </p><p>FOR THE LAST YEAR, HE HAD ILLEGALLY USURPED IT FROM A </p><p>CFU-BACKED DELEGATE.  WHILE THE NECF TASK FORCE HAS BEEN </p><p>LARGELY INACTIVE SINCE THE FARM INVASIONS BEGAN LAST </p><p>YEAR, THE CFU LEADERSHIP IS HOPING THAT IT MAY BECOME </p><p>THE FORUM FOR REENGAGING THE GOZ WITH THE NEW PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>MAKONI SEEN AS A KEY PLAYER </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ACCORDING TO CLOETE, THE CFU HAS BEEN QUIETLY </p><p>CULTIVATING CONTACTS WITH THE FINANCE MINISTER, SIMBA </p><p>MAKONI.  THEY VIEW HIM AS A KEY GOZ OFFICIAL WHO, </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS ROLE IN TRYING TO STABILIZE THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>ECONOMY, MAY HAVE SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE AND HIS CIRCLE OF ADVISORS TO HELP GET BOTH SIDES </p><p>SERIOUSLY TALKING AGAIN.  THE CFU LEADERSHIP BELIEVES </p><p>THAT MAKONI UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT </p><p>COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE PLAYS IN THE ECONOMY, AND THAT IT </p><p>IS ONE SECTOR THAT CAN BE QUICKLY STIMULATED TO GENERATE </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH, FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS, AND </p><p>EMPLOYMENT, AS WELL AS FEED THE NATION.  FOR THIS REASON </p><p>THE CFU PLAN TO USE MAKONI AS A CONDUIT TO PRESENT THEIR </p><p>NEW PLAN TO MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01102  02 OF 03  230534Z </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WILL THE GOZ RESPOND? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) CLOETE SAID THAT ONCE THE CFU PLAN IS PRESENTED </p><p>TO THE GOZ, THE BALL IS IN THE LATTER\'S COURT.  HOWEVER, </p><p>TO ENCOURAGE A POSITIVE RESPONSE THE CONGRESS AGREED </p><p>THAT THE CFU MUST MAKE CLEAR TO PRESIDENT MUGABE THAT IT </p><p>WANTS TO BE A HELPFUL PARTNER IN RESOLVING THE IMPASSE </p><p>OVER LAND, THAT IT IS SETTING NO PRECONDITIONS TO TALK, </p><p>AND THAT THE UNION WILL PURSUE NO ADDITIONAL LEGAL </p><p>ACTIONS AGAINST THE GOZ.  THE CFU IS GOING TO USE ALL </p><p>AVENUES TO GET THEIR MESSAGE ACROSS TO MUGABE AND THE </p><p>GOZ, INCLUDING INVOLVING THE GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>THE CFU WILL TRY TO DO THIS OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE, </p><p>HOPING THAT THEY CAN CONVINCE MUGABE THAT HE CAN ENGAGE </p><p>WITH THE UNION AND COMMERCIAL FARMERS IN A WIN-WIN </p><p>SITUATION THAT WILL ALLOW HIM TO TAKE CREDIT FOR SOLVING </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE.  CLOETE STATED THAT THE CFU RECOGNIZES </p><p>THAT THIS LAST POINT IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF THEIR </p><p>PLAN, BECAUSE IF MUGABE AND ZANU-PF CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>USE THE LAND ISSUE TO TRY AND REGAIN POPULAR SUPPORT, </p><p>THE NEW PLAN WILL BE STILLBORN. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5120 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01102  03 OF 03  230534Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  BBG-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------D60F6F  230534Z /38 </p><p>P 230531Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8491 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 001102 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/22/11 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, PHUM, EAID, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S COMMERCIAL FARMERS AGREE AT CONGRESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01102  03 OF 03  230534Z </p><p>ON A STRATEGY TO RE-ENGAGE WITH THE GOZ ON LAND </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN OUR OPINION, THE ACTION PLAN AGREED TO AT THE </p><p>SPECIAL CONGRESS IS A COMPREHENSIVE AND WELL-THOUGHT OUT </p><p>STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT IN ZIMBABWE, WHILE MAINTAINING THE </p><p>VIABILITY OF COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE.  WHETHER THE CFU </p><p>LEADERSHIP WILL BE ABLE TO GET PRESIDENT MUGABE TO </p><p>SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE PLAN, AND THEN TO WORK WITH THE </p><p>FARMERS IN FINDING A WAY FORWARD WILL DEPEND ON THE </p><p>EXTENT TO WHICH MUGABE CAN CLAIM PERSONAL AND ZANU-PF </p><p>CREDIT FOR GIVING LAND TO THE BLACK MAJORITY AS A </p><p>RESULT.  THE ROLE THAT MAKONI MAY PLAY IN PROMOTING THIS </p><p>PLAN TO MUGABE WILL BE CRITICAL.  HE HAS A LIMITED </p><p>WINDOW IN WHICH TO DO SO BECAUSE WE FIGURE THAT AFTER </p><p>JUNE THE MAJORITY PARTY WILL BE FOCUSED ON THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALMOST ALL </p><p>OTHER ISSUES.  THE SEVERE ECONOMIC CRISIS FACING </p><p>ZIMBABWE GIVES MAKONI SOME LEVERAGE IN THIS EFFORT, BUT </p><p>IT MAY NOT SUFFICE TO OVERCOME THOSE IN ZANU-PF, </p><p>INCLUDING MUGABE HIMSELF, WHO SEE THE CURRENT "FAST- </p><p>TRACK" LAND PROGRAM AS THE ONLY WAY TO INCREASE THE </p><p>PARTY\'S, AND ITS CANDIDATE\'S, POPULARITY PRIOR TO THE </p><p>UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
