<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000218 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 02-07-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, PHUM, CE, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  SA/INS Director visits Jaffna -- discussions </p><p>with military and Tamils focus on security zone issue </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 202, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  SA/INS Director David Good led a </p><p>Mission team to Jaffna on February 6.  The major topic </p><p>of conversation was the Sri Lankan military\'s "high </p><p>security zones."  The military stated that there were </p><p>other pressing needs that need to be addressed before </p><p>the security zones should be reviewed.  Tamil leaders </p><p>stressed that the zones had displaced large numbers of </p><p>civilians and that a reduction in their size allowing </p><p>the resettlement of IDP\'s would be a major confidence- </p><p>building measure.  Even with the disagreement over the </p><p>zones, there was a palpable feeling among interlocutors </p><p>-- GSL and Tamil -- that the peace process was a net </p><p>positive and needed to continue.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Sri Lankan General stands firm </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Visiting SA/INS Director David Good led a Mission </p><p>team including Poloff and Pol FSN to Jaffna on </p><p>February 6.  The first stop for the team was the Sri </p><p>Lanka Army\'s (SLA) headquarters at Palaly Airbase.  SLA </p><p>commander for the Jaffna Peninsula Major General Fonseka </p><p>used the discussion to stress the need for the GSL and </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to pursue </p><p>issues other than the "high security zones." </p><p>(Note:  The Sri Lankan military\'s security zone network </p><p>covers about 18 percent of Jaffna\'s land area.  The LTTE </p><p>and other Tamils have been demanding a sharp reduction </p><p>in the size of the zones.  See Reftels for further </p><p>background.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) While admitting that the security zones were </p><p>large and that he understood the source of Tamil </p><p>concerns, Fonseka spent a significant amount of time </p><p>detailing his argument that only a small number of </p><p>families were actually affected by the security zones in </p><p>a negative way.  He further argued that a very </p><p>substantial part of returning Internally Displaced </p><p>Persons (IDP\'s) could be settled outside of the security </p><p>zones.  In any case, Fonseka asserted, there had been a </p><p>net population outflow from Jaffna in the past several </p><p>months, as Tamils left due to concern with the LTTE. </p><p>(Note:  We are not sure the evidence backs up this last </p><p>statement by Fonseka.  According to the latest UNHCR- </p><p>generated information, over 300,000 IDP\'s -- mostly </p><p>Tamils -- have returned to their places of origin in the </p><p>north and east since the start of the peace process in </p><p>December 2001.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Another of Fonseka\'s key points re the security </p><p>zones was that the LTTE remained a serious threat to GSL </p><p>armed forces in the Jaffna region.  Fonseka pointed to </p><p>what he characterized as a pattern of LTTE-instigated </p><p>incidents meant to harass some of the SLA\'s smaller </p><p>military outposts in Jaffna.  He also asserted that </p><p>whereas the Sri Lankan military had withdrawn from areas </p><p>stipulated in the February 2002 ceasefire accord, the </p><p>LTTE continued to violate terms of the agreement.  Given </p><p>this situation, the GSL had to move cautiously with </p><p>respect to the security zone issue -- a hasty withdrawal </p><p>could provide the LTTE a decisive strategic advantage. </p><p>He also commented that he was working closely with </p><p>Satish Nambiar, a retired Indian general who was </p><p>drafting a report on the security zone issue.  Fonseka </p><p>showed little enthusiasm for the report, reiterating </p><p>that the key objective must be security for GSL armed </p><p>forces in the region.  (Note:  The LTTE has underscored </p><p>that it will reject Nambiar\'s report if the draft not </p><p>meet its demands for a sharp reduction in the size of </p><p>the zones.  Nambiar is currently visiting Sri Lanka and </p><p>his report should be released soon.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Tamils press Humanitarian Needs </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While in Jaffna, Director Good also met with a </p><p>variety of Jaffna\'s religious and civil leaders.  The </p><p>leaders -- most of whom were Tamil -- focused their </p><p>concerns on what they considered the humanitarian </p><p>aspects of the security zones, arguing that they should </p><p>be reduced in size.  They argued that government steps </p><p>in this key area would constitute a major confidence- </p><p>building measure.  Catholic Bishop of Jaffna Thomas </p><p>Savundranayagam summarized the basic argument when he </p><p>stated that the IDP\'s returning to Jaffna do not want to </p><p>just have a roof over their head as the military might </p><p>suggest.  Rather, they want to return to their ancestral </p><p>homes and return to their previous professions of </p><p>farming or fishing.  For this to take place, the IDP\'s </p><p>required and hoped for considerable outside assistance. </p><p>Senior Hindu priest for Jaffna Somasundaram Swamigal </p><p>added that the continued overwhelming presence of the </p><p>military throughout the peninsula served to remind Tamil </p><p>civilians that they remained "under military </p><p>occupation."  He argued that the negative psychological </p><p>effect that this situation has on Tamil children was </p><p>immeasurable. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) P. Vigneswaran, leader of the NGO Council in </p><p>Jaffna, was even more strident.  He stated that the </p><p>military had to vacate the security zones immediately. </p><p>He repeatedly stressed that the military is the main </p><p>impediment to progress toward peace in Jaffna. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Some Convergence of Views </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Good stressed during each meeting that the issues </p><p>currently being discussed were issues of peace and not </p><p>of war, thus there was improvement over just a year ago. </p><p>Despite their sharp disagreement over the security zone </p><p>issue, all interlocutors -- military and Tamil -- agreed </p><p>with that.  The ease of travel, the lifting of </p><p>checkpoints, and -- most importantly -- the end of </p><p>fighting created a measurable improvement in the quality </p><p>of life for all involved.  Good also asked his </p><p>interlocutors about their perception of commitment by </p><p>the GSL and LTTE to the peace process.  Everyone </p><p>believed that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was </p><p>committed to making the peace process work.  Although </p><p>Fonseka did not address the issue of the politics in the </p><p>south, informal conversations with his staff seemed to </p><p>show the same concern in the military as Jaffna\'s </p><p>civilian population for the issue of "cohabitation" </p><p>between the president and Prime Minister.  Where the </p><p>views diverged was on the role of the LTTE.  The </p><p>military, the Muslim community, and the international </p><p>aid workers (UNICEF, ICRC, and Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission representatives) all focused on some of the </p><p>practices of the LTTE that had to end.  On the other </p><p>hand, Tamil civil society leaders (though not religious </p><p>leaders who did not touch on the matter) either stated </p><p>that the LTTE was not carrying out acts such as the </p><p>recruitment of children or excused incidents such as </p><p>taxes as needed in response to the military. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Good emphasized during each meeting the USG\'s </p><p>commitment to help where it could.  He stated that the </p><p>highest levels of the USG were interested in Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>peace process and that we were committed to help.  He </p><p>stated that the USG will commit to more demining </p><p>activities and that the Deputy Secretary hoped to attend </p><p>the upcoming donor\'s conference in Tokyo (see Reftels). </p><p>Each interlocutor expressed gratitude for the efforts of </p><p>the USG and for the visit to Jaffna. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) During the Jaffna visit, the security zone issue </p><p>came out loud-and-clear as the issue on most everyone\'s </p><p>mind.  With the military and most Tamils on different </p><p>sides of the fence regarding this matter, it is </p><p>obviously going to be a very complicated and tricky to </p><p>work out.  As he moves forward with his report, General </p><p>Nambiar is clearly going to have his hands full.  On the </p><p>positive side of the ledger, there was a convergence of </p><p>opinion among all interlocutors of whatever stripe that </p><p>the peace process had brought improvements and needed to </p><p>continue.  (Note:  The fifth round of GSL-LTTE peace </p><p>talks is scheduled to take place February 7-8 in </p><p>Berlin.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Director Good cleared on this message. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
