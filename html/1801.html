<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001614 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/06/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: MORE ETHNIC CLASHES IN NIGERIAN MIDDLE-BELT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (B/D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary.  Inter-ethnic clashes have occurred in the </p><p>Middle-Belt States of Bauchi and Taraba, in incidents not </p><p>apparently connected to the several weeks-long turmoil in </p><p>neighboring Nasarawa State.  In Bauchi, in a predominately </p><p>Christian area, the majority Siyawa people have fought </p><p>Hausa-Fulani in a reprise of disputes stretching back to </p><p>early 1990s. According to the International Red Cross, </p><p>perhaps as many as 20,000 persons have fled their homes, and </p><p>several dozen people may have lost their lives.  In Taraba, a </p><p>dispute between Fulani herders and Tiv farmers resulted in </p><p>eight deaths, according to the National Police.  Residents </p><p>are also fleeing the area, but the numbers are unknown.  A </p><p>fragile peace appears to be holding in Nasarawa, while the </p><p>Governors of Benue and Nasarawa jointly work toward </p><p>reconciliation.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Scattered press reports surfaced this week of ethnic </p><p>conflict in Bauchi and Taraba State, two Middle-Belt </p><p>neighbors of Nasarawa State, scene of ethnic turmoil for the </p><p>past several weeks.  The Governor of Bauchi State, Adamu </p><p>Mu\'azu, confirmed to Poloff July 4 violent conflict in the </p><p>southern section of his state, in an area predominately </p><p>inhabited by the Christian Siyawa group.  Explaining that </p><p>long-standing feuds over access to land and to local </p><p>government resources had fueled the conflict, the Governor </p><p>claimed that the conflict had no real religious dimension to </p><p>it, and was purely a local dispute between groups long </p><p>hostile to each other.  The Governor said he had spent two </p><p>nights sleeping at the Local Government headquarters at </p><p>Tafewa Balewa, circulating in the area during the day and </p><p>urging peace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Head of the International Red Cross (IRC) effort in </p><p>Nigeria, Jean-Jacques Gacond, told poloff July 6 that, </p><p>according to estimates collected from traditional leaders by </p><p>his office, as many as 20,000 people had fled their homes, </p><p>and several dozen deaths had occurred.  Gacond cautioned that </p><p>these estimates were "soft," as only second hand, and perhaps </p><p>unreliable.  Gacond said that, in his opinion, the state </p><p>government authorities were masking to some extent the </p><p>religious nature of the conflict to prevent any spill-over </p><p>effect in areas where Muslims and Christians were intermixed </p><p>(a phenomenon prevalent throughout the Middle-Belt). </p><p>However, he also thought that the violence had largely been </p><p>contained and people were beginning to go back to their </p><p>homes.  He had a team on the scene, and would hear more </p><p>precise details in the next several days, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In Taraba State to the southeast of Bauchi, and </p><p>directly east of Nasarawa, fighting has occurred between Tiv </p><p>farmers and Fulani herdsmen.  At this time of year, with the </p><p>rainy season well underway, Fulani herders across the </p><p>Middle-Belt are on their way back North with their cattle and </p><p>sheep, and conflict often results with local farmers when </p><p>herds trample crops.  National Police sources in Abuja told </p><p>us that eight deaths had occurred.  Other sources in Taraba </p><p>say that the death toll is "at least" eighteen.  While some </p><p>press reports have linked these clashes in Taraba with the </p><p>earlier clashes between Tivs, Jukuns, Hausa-speakers and </p><p>other minority ethnic groups in southeastern Nasarawa State </p><p>(which borders on Taraba), this appears to be an isolated </p><p>incident.  Police in Abuja report that people have fled their </p><p>homes to avoid the fighting, but had no estimates.  Some </p><p>media reports recorded 25,000 people fleeing the conflict, </p><p>which appears to be centered near the predominately Junkun </p><p>town of Wukari.  According to Embassy sources, state police </p><p>commissioners in Makurdi, capital of Benue, and Yola, capital </p><p>of Adamawa, have each dispatched additional security </p><p>personnel to Taraba to aid in damping down the conflict. </p><p>While some Jukuns, traditional rivals to the Tivs, seem to be </p><p>involved as well in the conflict between herders and farmers, </p><p>they appear to play a subsidiary role so far. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In nearby Nasarawa State, a fragile peace appears to </p><p>be holding.  IRC head Gacond said that the numbers of people </p><p>at the displaced persons camps in Benue had basically </p><p>stabilized at about 8,000, with some movement back and forth </p><p>between those staying with friends and family in the area </p><p>(about 40,000) and those accommodated in the two camps </p><p>located north of Makurdi at Dauda and Uikom.  Gacond said </p><p>that in Lafia, capital of Nasarawa, the numbers had declined </p><p>to about 2,000, and people did appear to be returning to </p><p>their homes.  At the Embassy July 4th reception, Governor </p><p>Adamu of Nasarawa and Governor Akume of Benue (who arrived </p><p>together) appeared optimistic that the worst of the conflict </p><p>was over, and that displaced people in Benue would also begin </p><p>to return to their homes in the near future.  While they </p><p>confirmed that additional clashes had occurred over the </p><p>week-end of June 30-July 1, with some loss of life, they said </p><p>that their joint efforts at peace-keeping had reduced tension </p><p>in many areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment.  Ethnic conflict in the Middle-Belt, based </p><p>on long-standing disputes over land, access to government </p><p>resources, and community status, often play out in relative </p><p>obscurity, and can continue for months without much notice </p><p>from the national media (and sometimes with the connivance of </p><p>government authorities anxious to downplay the tensions and </p><p>prevent spreading turmoil).  The latest conflicts in Bauchi </p><p>and Taraba do not appear to have any connection to Nasarawa </p><p>State\'s own ethnic clashes.  While there may be some </p><p>religious component to the Bauchi fighting, this so far seems </p><p>to be a localized dispute with no great potential to spill </p><p>over into other areas.  The conflict between Tivs and Jukuns, </p><p>bitter rivals in many communities in several states in the </p><p>eastern Middle-Belt, also does not at present appear to be </p><p>spreading beyond Nasarawa.  End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
