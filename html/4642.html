Erdogan </p><p>is going to the US for 24 hours at the invistation of </p><p>President Bush.  Washington will welcome Erdogan with the </p><p>highest level of  protocol.  Today\'s "Zaman" reports that </p><p>Erdogan will meet with SecDef Rumsfeld, SecState Powell, and </p><p>National Security Advisor Condolezza Rice before meeting </p><p>with President Bush and Vice-President Cheney.  Reportedly, </p><p>The US will reportedly support Turkey\'s EU accession, and </p><p>Erdogan will remind the US that Turkey was not compensated </p><p>after the Gulf war, and cannot endure new economic losses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU: All papers report on Turkey\'s EU lobbying efforts, from </p><p>every angle, on the eve of the Copenhagen Summit.  "Zaman" </p><p>reports that Erdogan went to Copenhagen last night to seek </p><p>support from EU term President Denmark\'s Prime Minister </p><p>Rasmussen.  Erdogan reportedly said that the EU should begin </p><p>talks with Turkey before the end of 2003.  President Sezer </p><p>and PM Gul will also go to Copenhagen for meetings with EU </p><p>officials.  "Yeni Safak" reports that the government has </p><p>launched a new operation for stepping up pressure on the EU. </p><p>Meanwhile, Turkish businessmen have launched an advertising </p><p>campaign in newspapers across the EU.  The advertisements </p><p>carry pictures of two plants, one without a flower and the </p><p>other with a red flower representing Turkey.  The message </p><p>below reads: `take action now and the results will surprise </p><p>you.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Sunday\'s "Hurriyet" reports that TRNC president </p><p>Denktas returned to Cyprus after the heart surgery in the </p><p>US.  On his return, Denktas met with PM Gul and AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan at the airport in Istanbul, and stressed that he had </p><p>no hope for a settlement in Cyprus.  Although Sunday papers </p><p>quoted PM Gul as saying that there were no disagreements </p><p>between Turkey and the TRNC, Sunday\'s "Zaman" comments that </p><p>the negative turn in EU accession talks was weakening hopes </p><p>for a solution in Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: All weekend papers and TV channels covered Iraq\'s </p><p>11,000-page report on its WMD program, which was submitted </p><p>to the UN.  "Hurriyet" reports that the US does not trust </p><p>Iraq, and insists that it has proof that Iraq does indeed </p><p>possess weapons of mass destruction.  "Milliyet" cites the </p><p>New York Times in reporting that US deployments in the Gulf </p><p>will be sufficient by January 2003 to launch an operation </p><p>against Iraq. </p><p>US Senators visit Kurdish refugees in Northern Iraq: Weekend </p><p>papers and today\'s "Turkish Daily News" cover Senators Biden </p><p>and Hagel meeting with politicians and refugees in Kurdish- </p><p>controlled Northern Iraq.  This is the highest level US </p><p>visit to the autonomous zone since it was established in </p><p>1991 following the Gulf war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p>1. Erdogan to US </p><p>2. Turkey-EU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ozal treatment for Erdogan" </p><p>Washington reporter of mass appeal "Milliyet" Yasemin Congar </p><p>wrote (12/9): "The US President is going to host Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan as a prime minister.  Erdogan\'s treatment as </p><p>Turkey\'s new leader coincides with the upcoming EU summit, </p><p>in which the US will repeat its message to Europe: `Turkey </p><p>should be in Europe.\' . Erdogan\'s visit is the result of </p><p>American pragmatism.  The U.S. simply put aside the question </p><p>marks about protocol issues, as well as the possible </p><p>uneasiness within the Turkish military.  Instead, reality </p><p>prevailed - that is, Iraq, September 11, and the EU.  There </p><p>is also an Erdogan phenomenon in Washington.  There are many </p><p>in the US administration who believe that Tayyip Erdogan </p><p>might the first true successor to Turkey\'s late president </p><p>Ozal. . Yet it would be too early to say that the US has </p><p>already found a new Ozal spirit in Erdogan.  It is true that </p><p>both Grossman and Wolfowitz left Turkey with very positive </p><p>impressions about Erdogan, and that Erdogan\'s reformist </p><p>approach is very much appreciated here.  But a group of </p><p>`Turkey-watchers\' are still skeptical about Tayyip Erdogan. </p><p>The analysts in the think-tanks frequently note that `a </p><p>leopard cannot change its spots.\'  . However, the Bush </p><p>administration is not acting with skepticism  -- at least </p><p>for the time being.  The US Government seems to have awarded </p><p>Erdogan `advance credit,\' which is a very rare thing in </p><p>Washington.  It remains to be seen how much Mr. Erdogan will </p><p>use this unique opportunity." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The 2005 Crap" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in mass appeal-conservative Turkiye </p><p>(12/9): "The date for the EU accession in Chirac and </p><p>Schroeder\'s minds is very wrong, and has the potential to </p><p>undermine Turkey\'s relations with the EU.  They think that </p><p>July 2005 is a valid date, but in fact it is both wrong and </p><p>suffers from a lack of justification.  Turkey cannot </p><p>tolerate being kept in the waiting room for another three </p><p>years.  We are talking about a country which has been a </p><p>member of NATO since 1952 and signed the first agreement for </p><p>European membership in 1963, at a time when the EU consisted </p><p>of 6 members. . Yes, we have a lot to do, and yes, we have </p><p>made some mistakes along the way.  Yet all of this does not </p><p>justify the critical mistake that France and Germany are </p><p>planning to make." </p><p></p></div>
