<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001074 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND OES </p><p>STATE PASS EPA </p><p>AMMAN FOR ENVIRONMENT HUB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, EPET, ALOW, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: THE WORD ON KUWAIT\'S ENVIRONMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 00920 </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 01021 </p><p>     C. KUWAIT 1064 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: As US-led military action against Iraq moved into </p><p>its sixth day, Kuwait stepped up measures to protect the </p><p>environment from Iraqi retaliatory strikes.  Particular focus </p><p>has been placed on monitoring the air and sea, as dark clouds </p><p>from Iraqi oil fires continue to drift across the border into </p><p>Kuwait.  In recent days the GOK launched a public relations </p><p>campaign to assure its populace -- both remaining in Kuwait </p><p>and temporarily outside the country -- that environmental </p><p>conditions remain safe, despite troubling images seen in </p><p>newspapers and on TV. </p><p> </p><p>DARK SKIES </p><p>---------- </p><p>2. On March 22, the GOK\'s Emergency Response Committee (ref </p><p>A) held one of its regular meetings to discuss damage caused </p><p>by oil fires burning in Iraq and other potential threats to </p><p>Kuwait\'s environment.  The Committee draws together officials </p><p>from several departments tasked with protecting the </p><p>environment in the face of Iraqi aggression.  Environmental </p><p>Public Authority (EPA) Chairman Dr. Mohammad Sarawi, who </p><p>oversees the Committee, announced that the GOK was planning </p><p>to open a mobile laboratory near its northern border to </p><p>monitor the atmosphere for pollutants, in addition to the six </p><p>fixed stations already operating throughout the country. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Dr. Sarawi told Econoff March 23 that he had been </p><p>tracking with some concern the advance of large, black clouds </p><p>entering Kuwait from Iraq.  Local press described the sky in </p><p>Jahra, 12 miles north of Kuwait City, as being "very black </p><p>and close to the ground, causing poor visibility."  Sarawi </p><p>stressed that the clouds caused by Iraq setting fire to its </p><p>own oil wells still did not pose any health hazards in Kuwait </p><p>(ref B). </p><p> </p><p>4. Dr. Sarawi was hopeful that wind gusts expected later this </p><p>week would drive out any pollutants, but acknowledged the </p><p>threat of longer term effects to Kuwait\'s environment.  He </p><p>said that a team of experts from Houston (Boots and Coots </p><p>International Well Control), contracted by the USG to fight </p><p>oil fires in southern Iraq, predicted it might take as long </p><p>as 35-40 days to fully bring burning oil fields under </p><p>control.  (See ref C for more information on fire fighting </p><p>activities.) </p><p> </p><p>CLEAN WATER </p><p>----------- </p><p>5. Captain Ali Haider, Director of EPA\'s Marine Pollution </p><p>Monitoring Department, told Econoff that his staff had not </p><p>registered any oil spills in the Gulf.  Prior to the outbreak </p><p>of fighting, the GOK had feared that Iraq might use oil as a </p><p>weapon by dumping it into Kuwaiti waters.  Haider explained </p><p>that any spill in the Gulf could take three to four days to </p><p>reach the Sabiya station (just south of Bubiyan Island), </p><p>where his staff was located, yet he was fairly confident </p><p>there would be no spills now that coalition forces were </p><p>securing Iraq\'s main ports. </p><p> </p><p>6. Haider was concerned, however, that oil particles from the </p><p>Iraqi fires would stick to the sand and dust present in the </p><p>Kuwaiti air following recent sand storms.  Weighted down from </p><p>the oil, this debris might then drop into the Gulf, creating </p><p>a situation similar to a limited oil slick.  Haider said his </p><p>team was taking readings from the water to determine what </p><p>clean-up procedures might need to be taken.  Divers were also </p><p>investigating potential damage caused when an Iraqi missile </p><p>struck the water near Kuwait\'s Shuaiba Port. </p><p> </p><p>7. Dr. Sarawi added that Kuwait\'s drinking water remained </p><p>safe and free of pollutants.  Daily laboratory tests taken </p><p>from ten locations revealed that the drinking water continued </p><p>to meet international standards established by the World </p><p>Health Organization, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GETTING THE WORD OUT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>8. The Emergency Response Committee has begun a community </p><p>outreach campaign to allay any fears people might have about </p><p>environmental conditions.  As a counter to newspaper photos </p><p>and TV images of Kuwait\'s darkened skies, Dr. Sarawi has </p><p>conducted interviews with several major media outlets.  CNN </p><p>has run on its "ticker tape" statements he made, while </p><p>Kuwait\'s Arabic- and English-language newspapers have printed </p><p>articles featuring Dr. Sarawi and other environmental </p><p>experts. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Last week, Kuwait\'s EPA established an Internet website </p><p>that enables concerned citizens to follow the air quality in </p><p>six locations throughout the country.  The site </p><p>(www.epa.org.kw) provides contact information and hourly </p><p>reports on pollution levels for a variety of chemicals in the </p><p>air.  It is rather simplistic, however, and somewhat </p><p>confusing, as there is no explanation for viewers on the type </p><p>or severity of pollutants listed.  (Note: Post suggested to </p><p>the EPA that it consider expanding the site and making it </p><p>more user-friendly. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>10.  Kuwaitis remember well the horrors of the environmental </p><p>damage left by retreating Iraqi forces in 1991, including the </p><p>burning of more than 700 oil wells that blackened the skies </p><p>for seven months -- hence the front page attention given to </p><p>Dr. Sarawi\'s statements.  Despite that disaster, Kuwaitis </p><p>still do not have a great sense of responsibility for their </p><p>environment, and we remain skeptical that the current crisis </p><p>will change their attitudes.  Nonetheless, we might be able </p><p>to use the present attention focused on the environment, </p><p>coupled with the positive relationship being forged through </p><p>USG-GOK cooperation on this issue, as a springboard toward </p><p>encouraging vital environmental reforms in Kuwait once the </p><p>conflict is over. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
