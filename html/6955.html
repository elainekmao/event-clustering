The DART Abuse Prevention Unit has been activated to </p><p>identify, monitor, prevent, and respond to human rights </p><p>abuses and protection issues in Iraq.  Since arriving in </p><p>Kuwait, the APU has briefed military units, NGOs, ORHA, and </p><p>the USAID Reconstruction Team on the importance of reporting </p><p>on reprisals and human rights abuses and the central role of </p><p>the APU in that process.  The APU is coordinating its work </p><p>closely with State (PRM/DRL), NSC, and DOD.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>APU BRIEFINGS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On 25 March, in coordination with several non- </p><p>governmental organizations (NGOs), the DART Abuse Prevention </p><p>Unit (APU) completed an official Request For Information </p><p>(RFI) with the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) that </p><p>would formally ask forward Coalition units to begin </p><p>reporting on human rights issues.  The APU is working with </p><p>the Military Liaison Unit (MLU) to develop additional </p><p>instructions for military personnel to identify and better </p><p>characterize human rights violations using the Rapid </p><p>Assessment Form. </p><p> </p><p>3.  During a meeting with Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) </p><p>on 25 March, the APU received a sample of "Survey Questions </p><p>for Determining Human Rights Abuses".  The APU will use </p><p>these as a basis for its own assessments.  PHR also raised </p><p>the possibility of establishing joint NGO / DART teams to </p><p>monitor human rights abuses. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The APU has distributed 200 `Field Guides to Preventing, </p><p>Mitigating, and Responding to Human Rights Abuses" to </p><p>Coalition forces and NGOs, including Interaction, PHR, the </p><p>International Organization for Migration, and others.  An </p><p>additional 800 Field Guides are scheduled to arrive by the </p><p>end of the week and will be rapidly distributed.  Many </p><p>Coalition units and NGOs have asked the DART for additional </p><p>copies of the Field Guide, and the APU is considering </p><p>ordering an additional 2,000. </p><p> </p><p>5.  On 26 March, the APU met with senior staff at ORHA to </p><p>discuss plans for preventing, deterring, and responding to </p><p>human rights abuses.  ORHA expressed strong support for </p><p>APU\'s program and offered assistance, including ensuring </p><p>that the APU will have maximum access in country and </p><p>offering to recruit additional Abuse Prevention Officers </p><p>(APOs) if necessary.  The APU is following up with ORHA to </p><p>identify potential Coalition force components that could be </p><p>used to assist responding to and deterring abuses. </p><p> </p><p>6.  On 27 March, an APO was part of the DART assessment of </p><p>Umm Qasr. General unrest after fighting was dominated by </p><p>looting of government and property of regime supporters. </p><p>Coalition forces there report that there may have been some </p><p>"lynching" but do not know of any specific incidents to </p><p>corroborate the statement.  Doctors at the hospital gave no </p><p>information about treating victims of violence other than </p><p>war wounded. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  The DART APU will continue to gather information that is </p><p>crucial to the monitoring and prevention of human rights </p><p>abuses.  Once the DART moves into the field, the APU will </p><p>include regular reporting on human rights issues that impact </p><p>political and military stability.  The APU will continue to </p><p>coordinate its response with other USG agencies operating in </p><p>the field. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
