<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003130 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETTC, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ/UNSC SANCTIONS:  DEMARCHE ON ROYAL JORDANIAN </p><p>FLIGHTS DELIVERED, MESSAGE HEARD </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 112154 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  A/DCM covered ref points on Royal Jordanian airlines </p><p>(RJ) flights to Baghdad June 11 with Ali al-Ayed, Personal </p><p>Assistant to Foreign Minister Muasher.  A/DCM stressed that </p><p>RJ has conducted 4-times-weekly flights to Baghdad since </p><p>January, and 5-times-weekly flights since April, and that the </p><p>frequency and regularity of the flights makes them appear to </p><p>be regular commercial flights, not/not humanitarian flights. </p><p>In addition, the recent circular diplomatic note from the </p><p>Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad advertising the flights and </p><p>offering diplomatic discounts raised particular concern in </p><p>Washington.  A/DCM urged the GOJ restrict the frequency and </p><p>regularity of RJ operations to and from Baghdad, end </p><p>advertising and discounts, and ensure that all RJ flights are </p><p>truly humanitarian and in keeping with UN sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ayed took careful notes, and -- in the absence of </p><p>FonMin Muasher -- promised to convey the demarche to the </p><p>Acting FonMin.  He expected that the issue would go to the </p><p>Prime Minister for a decision, and that GOJ officials would </p><p>speak to RJ about its traffic to and from Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COMMENT:  Ayed clearly understood the importance of </p><p>the demarche, and was visibly disturbed when he heard that </p><p>the Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad had sent a circular note </p><p>advertising the flights. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
