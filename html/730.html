WE TALKED TO SERB DETAINEES AND </p><p>UNSUCCESSFULY ATTEMPTED TO VISIT SERB LEADERS FROM THE </p><p>PAKRAC AREA, WHO WERE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION BY VELKJO </p><p>DJAKULA (REF).

POLOFFS AND DART VISITED SERB DETAINEES AT THE SPORTS </p><p>CENTER IN BJELOVAR.  AT THE TIME OP OUR VISIT, THE </p><p>PRISONERS WERE TAKING A BREAK OUTSIDE.  THE MILITARY </p><p>POLICE OFFICIAL, MATO SICAJA, IN CHARGE OP THE CENTER </p><p>REFUSED TO ANSWER MOST OP OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW </p><p>PRISONERS WERE LOCATED THERE AND HOW MANY HAD BEEN </p><p>RELEASED, CITING THE POTENTIAL FOR POLITICIZATION OF THE </p><p>NUMBERS.  AN ARGENTINE UNMO ON THE SCENE GUESSED THERE </p><p>WERE ABOUT 470 PRISONERS PRESENT.  AT THE END OF THE BREAK </p><p>PERIOD PRISONERS WERE LINED UP TO RETURN TO THE SPORTS </p><p>HALL AND EMBOFFS COUNTED APPROXIMATELY 450-500 PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALL THE DETAINEES WE TALKED WITH WERE PROM THE PAKRAC </p><p>AREA.  THEY SAID WHAT WE HAVE HEARD PROM PREVIOUS CONTACTS </p><p>-- THAT THEY WERE WELL TREATED AND HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH </p><p>THE GUARDS.  ONE OP THE DETAINEES HAD SUSTAINED RECENT </p><p>INJURIES WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY POLICE, WERE </p><p>SELF INFLICTED (IN THE PRESENCE OP ECMM, SUBJECT </p><p>REPORTEDLY BANGED HIS HEAD WHILE STANDING NEAR A GUARD). </p><p>EACH WAS PROVIDED WITH BLANKETS, BUT SAID THAT SLEEPING </p><p>ROOM WAS CRAMPED.  ONE GROUP OP DETAINEES SAID THAT THE </p><p>ENTIRE GROUP HAD BEEN WOKEN UP THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND TOLD </p><p>TO SIGN SOMETHING, BUT THEY DIDN\'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. </p><p>GUARDS TOLD US THAT THEY WERE RESPONDING TO CONSTANT </p><p>REQUESTS PROM ZAGREB POR PRECISE HEADCOUNTS AT VARIOUS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01801  01 OF 03  101545Z </p><p>TIMES DURING THE DAY AND WOKE THE DETAINEES TO HAVE THEM </p><p>SIGN A SHEET SHOWING THEY WERE PRESENT.  OPFICIALS QUICKLY </p><p>PROVIDED EMBOPPS WITH A COPY OF ONE OP THE PAGES ON WHICH </p><p>WERE HAND PRINTED NAMES, BIRTHDATES, AND SIGNATURES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WHEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WANTED TO REMAIN IN CROATIA OR </p><p>GO TO BOSNIA OR SERBIA, SOME RESPONDED THAT THEY WANTED TO </p><p>FIND OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEIR FAMILIES BEFORE THEY </p><p>MADE A DECISION (DETAINEES SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN </p><p>TOUCH WITH THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH THE ICRC).  ONE PERSON </p><p>SAID THAT A NUMBER OF THE DETAINEES WOULD LIKE UNHCR TO </p><p>RESETTLE THEM IN THIRD COUNTRIES RATHER THAN RETURN TO </p><p>BOSNIAN SERB TERRITORY.  ONE GROUP THAT DART TALKED TO </p><p>SAID THEY HAD BEEN TRYING TO CROSS FROM SECTOR WEST INTO </p><p>BOSNIA FOR THE LAST YEAR, BUT WERE PREVENTED FROM DOING SO </p><p>BY BOSNIAN SERB TROOPS.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT THEY WERE </p><p>PREVENTED FROM DOING SO EVEN DURING THE RETREAT FROM </p><p>SECTOR WEST DURING THE CROATIAN OFFENSIVE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>BJELOVAR JAIL AND THE JUDICIAL PROCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ9632 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9632 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01801  02 OF 03  101545Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  OASY-00  EB-01    FDRE-01  H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-10    L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SP-00 </p><p>      SR-00    SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00 </p><p>      NISC-01  PMB-00   PRME-01  DRL-09   G-00       /033W </p><p>                  ------------------C42E91  101629Z /49 </p><p>P 101646Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5714 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>COM SIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J-5PMA/J21// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XP/IN// </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>USNMR SHAPE BE//POLAD// </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01801  02 OF 03  101545Z </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5// </p><p>HQUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 001801 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR A/S HOLBROOKE </p><p>A/BHR/OFDA </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 5/10/96 </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS PGOV PHUM HR UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  CROATIA UPDATE NO. 32: VISIT TO DETAINEES IN </p><p>          BJELOVAR </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  EMBOFFS WERE TOLD BY DETENTION CENTER OFFICIALS THAT </p><p>SERB MILITARY LEADERS AND THOSE SUSPECTED OF WAR CRIMES </p><p>WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE BJELOVAR JAIL.  CROAT OFFICIALS </p><p>HAD NO OBJECTIONS TO OUR REQUEST TO VISIT THE JAIL.  WHEN </p><p>WE ARRIVED, HOWEVER, WE WERE TOLD THAT WE COULD NOT VISIT </p><p>THE PRISONERS WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION FROM THE JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTRY IN ZAGREB.  (NOTE: EMBASSY IS REQUESTING </p><p>AUTHORIZATION AND HOPES TO VISIT THE BJELOVAR JAIL AGAIN </p><p>ON MAY 11.)  WE DID TALK WITH PRISON ADMINISTRATOR ZDRAVKO </p><p>BREBER AND CHIEF MILITARY JUDGE MIHAEL MALCIC.  BREBER </p><p>TOLD US THAT INITIALLY THERE WERE 781 DETAINEES IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01801  02 OF 03  101545Z </p><p>BJELOVAR AND THAT 49 HAD BEEN RELEASED MAY 8 AND ANOTHER </p><p>GROUP OF 138 ON MAY 7. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE CITY PRISON IN BJELOVAR IS BEING CONVERTED TO A </p><p>MILITARY PRISON AND WILL TAKE ALL TRANSFERS FROM OTHER </p><p>DETENTION CENTERS IN VARAZDIN AND POZEGA.  AS OF MAY 8 </p><p>THERE WERE 48 DETAINEES IN THE PRISON AND OFFICIALS </p><p>EXPECTED TO GET 50 TRANSFERS FROM VARAZDIN ON MAY 9 AND </p><p>POSSIBLY ANOTHER 10 FROM THE BJELOVAR SPORTS CENTER. </p><p>(NOTE: BREBER TOLD US THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN HIS GUARD </p><p>FORCE AND DETAINEES WERE GOOD AND, IN FACT, TWO OF FOUR </p><p>GUARDS ON THE AFTERNOON SHIFT WERE ETHNIC SERBS.)  IN </p><p>TOTAL, BREBER ANTICIPATED HAVING OVER 100 PRISONERS, BUT </p><p>JUDGE MALCIC SAID PROBABLY THAT ONLY 20 TO 30 WOULD BE </p><p>CHARGED WITH WAR CRIMES.  THE DECISION TO TRANSFER </p><p>DETAINEES TO THE JAIL FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS MADE </p><p>DURING THE INITIAL INTERVIEW AND IS LARGELY BASED ON </p><p>EVIDENCE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED BY CROATIAN DISPLACED </p><p>PERSONS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  BREBER CONFIRMED THAT TWO OF THE THREE PRISONERS -- </p><p>MLADEN KULIC AND STEVO HARAMBASIC -- ABOUT WHOM SERB </p><p>LEADER VELJKO DJAKULA HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN ON MAY 9 WERE </p><p>BEING HELD IN THE PRISON, BUT THEY HAD NO INFORMATION ON </p><p>THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE THIRD, SAVO RADOSEVIC.  KULIC WAS </p><p>BEING HELD ON CHARGES OF ARMED REBELLION AND CRIMES </p><p>AGAINST CIVILIANS, WHILE HARAMBASIC WAS HELD UNDER A COURT </p><p>ORDER, BUT NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE.  WE WERE </p><p>TOLD THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CASES WAS FILED </p><p>AT THE MILITARY COURT IN OSIJEK.  BOTH PRISONERS HAD REEN </p><p>REGISTERED WITH ICRC, ACCORDING TO BREBER.  MALCIC SAID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01801  02 OF 03  101545Z </p><p>THAT ALL PRISONERS HELD UNDER CHARGES OF ARMED REBELLION </p><p>WOULD BE RELEASED, BUT WE ARE UNSURE OF KULIC\'S STATUS </p><p>GIVEN THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE OF CRIMES AGAINST CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  MALCIC SAID THAT HE IS LEADING A TEAM OF 9 JUDGES AND </p><p>TYPISTS TO PROCESS 1,500 CASES.  BY 1500 ON MAY 9 HIS </p><p>STAFF HAD QUESTIONED 24 PEOPLE AND WOULD BE INTERVIEWING </p><p>ANOTHER 15 THAT DAY.  A GROUP OF TRANSFERS FROM VARAZDIN </p><p>WAS DUE TO BE PROCESSED ON MAY 10.  HE SAID THAT THE COURT </p><p>IS MOVING AS FAST AS IT CAN, BUT THE PROCESS IS SLOW </p><p>LARGELY BECAUSE OF CONSTANT REQUESTS FROM ZAGRER FOR </p><p>UPDATES AND STATISTICS.  SPECIFIC CRIMES THE COURT IS </p><p>LOOKING INTO INCLUDE MURDER, POISONING, AND DESTRUCTION OF </p><p>PROPERTY.  HE SAID THAT DETAINEES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE </p><p>DURING QUESTIONING AND MANY HAVE COMPLAINED THAT "RSK" </p><p>POLITICIANS AND LEADERS HAVE CHEATED THEM.  MALCIC OPINED </p><p>THAT HALF THE SERBS WHO DECIDE TO LEAVE FOR BOSNIA WILL </p><p>EVENTUALLY RETURN TO CROATIA, SOME TO LIVE AND </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY SOME TO FIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ9637 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9637 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01801  03 OF 03  101545Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  OASY-00  EB-01    FDRE-01  H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-10    L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SP-00 </p><p>      SR-00    SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00 </p><p>      NISC-01  PMB-00   PRME-01  DRL-09   G-00       /033W </p><p>                  ------------------C42EBD  101631Z /49 </p><p>P 101646Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5715 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>COM SIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J-5PMA/J21// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XP/IN// </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>USNMR SHAPE BE//POLAD// </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01801  03 OF 03  101545Z </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5// </p><p>HQUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 001801 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR A/S HOLBROOKE </p><p>A/BHR/OFDA </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 5/10/96 </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS PGOV PHUM HR UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  CROATIA UPDATE NO. 32: VISIT TO DETAINEES IN </p><p>          BJELOVAR </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.
