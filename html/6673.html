<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001044 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR TERRORIST FINANCE TASK FORCE </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, EFIN, PREL, PGOV, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAITI PARLIAMENT MOVING FORWARD ON </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 939 </p><p> </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 59891 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On March 22, the Ambassador joined the French </p><p>ambassador and the ambassadors of Italy, Canada and Russia as </p><p>well as the British and German DCM\'s to carry out the G8 </p><p>demarche on adherence to counter terrorism conventions with </p><p>Mohammed al-Sagr, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs </p><p>Committee of Kuwait\'s National Assembly (reftels).  French </p><p>Ambassador Losguardi made the pitch in his capacity as </p><p>representative of the G8 chair. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Al-Sagr responded that his committee had completed its </p><p>review of the conventions; the National Assembly was about to </p><p>move forward on legislation that would enable Kuwait to </p><p>complete accession to four of the five agreements.  He </p><p>explained that legislation on the Convention on the </p><p>Suppression of Acts against Maritime Navigation had already </p><p>passed a first reading.  Its second reading would be held </p><p>during next week\'s assembly session (March 31).  The first </p><p>reading of bills on three of the remaining four conventions </p><p>would likely be passed at the same time.  This would leave </p><p>only the 1999 Convention on Suppression of the Financing of </p><p>Terrorism (CSFT) to go. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) When questioned, al-Sagr explained that the CSFT had </p><p>also been on the agenda for a first reading next week, but he </p><p>had asked that it be delayed because he was concerned that </p><p>some deputies were planning to use the debate on the bill as </p><p>an opportunity to embarrass the GOK by criticizing aid to </p><p>Jordan.  He was reluctant to provide additional details, he </p><p>said, because the issue of relations with Jordan (which in </p><p>many Kuwaitis\' eyes "sided" with Iraq in 1990) remains highly </p><p>sensitive in Kuwait.  However, he felt that it would be </p><p>better to wait until after the current conflict with Iraq had </p><p>subsided before bringing this particular piece of legislation </p><p>to the floor of the assembly for debate. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Al-Sagr stressed that he did not see any trouble in </p><p>passing the legislation when the time comes; "maybe only five </p><p>people are against it," he said.  The Ambassador pointed out </p><p>that it might be hard for outsiders to understand why Kuwait </p><p>was moving on the other conventions but not on the CSFT.  He </p><p>noted that two branches of Kuwaiti charities had had their </p><p>assets frozen for suspicion of financing terrorism.  Some </p><p>would interpret inaction on the CSFT as a sign of a lack of </p><p>Kuwaiti resolve on this critical issue.  The French </p><p>Ambassador supported this line of argument.  Al-Sagr took the </p><p>point and agreed to consult with the Deputy Speaker of the </p><p>National Assembly about the possibility of adding the CSFT to </p><p>next week\'s session and avoiding criticism of Jordan.  He </p><p>warned the ambassadors that he might need to ask for their </p><p>help with a few key members of the National Assembly in this </p><p>regard. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  The impending progress on legislation on the </p><p>remaining five counter-terrorism conventions is very welcome </p><p>news.  We will continue to coordinate with our G8 colleagues </p><p>to encourage Mohammed al-Sagr and other members of the </p><p>National Assembly to keep working until all the conventions </p><p>have been approved. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
