<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003751 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: IR, KNNP, MNUC, PARM, IAEA </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF USG APPROACH FOR JUNE 16 </p><p>IAEA BOARD OF GOVERNORS MEETING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 152375 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Action Request at paragraph 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY. We delivered reftel demarche on June 9 to </p><p>representatives of the Turkish MFA, who promised full support </p><p>for the USG approach at the June 16 IAEA Board of Governors </p><p>meeting. The MFA Director-General for International Security </p><p>Affairs and Disarmament emphasized the strong concerns which </p><p>Turkey, as a neighbor, shared about Iran\'s nuclear program. </p><p>He queried whether there were other steps vis a vis suppliers </p><p>or otherwise that the U.S. would be suggesting to address </p><p>this problem. In addition, the MFA representatives requested </p><p>further information on two subjects: the Iranian Kala </p><p>Electric "Watch Factory," highlighted in the recent Los </p><p>Alamos presentation to the May Nuclear Suppliers Group </p><p>meeting, and a possible Pakistani role in Iran\'s nuclear </p><p>program. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DCM and Polmiloff met with Turan Morali </p><p>(Director-General for International Security Affairs and </p><p>Disarmament at the MFA) and Ibrahim Yagli (Disarmament </p><p>Department Head at the MFA) on June 9 to deliver reftel </p><p>demarche. DCM stressed USG concerns regarding Iran\'s nuclear </p><p>activities and the need for a strong response by the IAEA </p><p>Board of Governors to DG ElBaradei\'s report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Morali, stating that the GOT shares USG concerns </p><p>regarding Iran\'s nuclear activities, promised that the GOT </p><p>would fully support the USG approach for the Board of </p><p>Governors meeting. The GOT will deliver a strong national </p><p>statement and demarche the "skeptical states" to support the </p><p>USG approach. (NOTE: Polmiloff passed the full list of </p><p>"skeptical states" to Yagli on June 10, noting that the USG </p><p>does not have a particular preference as to which states the </p><p>GOT should approach.) Morali also said that the GOI has not </p><p>approached the GOT as part of its "public-relations" campaign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Morali also queried us on our expectations for Iranian </p><p>compliance and agreed the GOI was unlikely to provide </p><p>complete cooperation. He mused about other steps the U.S. </p><p>might suggest to deal with Iran\'s nuclear program, such as by </p><p>increasing pressure on potential suppliers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On a separate but related issue, Yagli asked whether </p><p>the USG had any further information on the Iranian Kala </p><p>Electric "Watch Factory," highlighted in the recent Los </p><p>Alamos presentation to the May Nuclear Suppliers Group </p><p>meeting. Morali also asked whether we had information on a </p><p>Pakistani role in Iran\'s nuclear program (NOTE: PM Erdogan </p><p>will be visiting Pakistan next week, which might be an </p><p>appropriate point for Turkey to raise any concerns in this </p><p>area.) </p><p>8. (C) ACTION REQUEST: Request that Washington inform Embassy </p><p>Ankara when additional information is ready to pass to the </p><p>GOT on the Iranian Kala Electric "Watch Factory," and if </p><p>there is any information which we can pass to the GOT on a </p><p>Pakistani role in Iran\'s nuclear program. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
