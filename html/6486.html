<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000711 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, GT, USOAS </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA WILL CONSIDER OAS BUDGET INCREASE IN JUNE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 50110 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Acting Director </p><p>General for Multilateral Affairs, Sylvia Corado, at the </p><p>Foreign Ministry on February 28.  Corado said she would have </p><p>to consult internally before she could speak officially. </p><p>However, she speculated that, given "severe" budget </p><p>constraints, the MFA would be hard-pressed to find an </p><p>additional $5,000 for the OAS.  On March 4, Poloffs spoke to </p><p>Jose Felix Palma, Director of the OAS office in Guatemala </p><p>City.  Palma indicated his discussions with the MFA were </p><p>proceeding positively.   Corado told us on March 5 that while </p><p>the MFA understood the symbolic importance of Guatemala\'s </p><p>small increase, her internal consultations had indicated it </p><p>was unlikely Guatemala would be able to increase its </p><p>contribution.  PolCouns raised the issue with Giovanni </p><p>Castillo, Director General for Multilateral Affairs, upon </p><p>Castillo\'s return from the NAM summit.  Castillo said that </p><p>due to the MFA\'s budget cycle, it would be June before the </p><p>proposal to increase the contribution to the OAS could be </p><p>considered. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
