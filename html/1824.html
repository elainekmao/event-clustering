THE TREATY </p><p>WAS ADOPTED BY THE UNGA ON SEPTEMBER 10, 1996, AND SIGNED BY </p><p>THE HOLY SEE ON SEPTEMBER 24 OF THE SAME YEAR.

VATICAN SPOKESMAN, JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS HAS ACCUSED </p><p>UNNAMED WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS OF TRYING TO PUT "A SPIN" ON </p><p>THE POPE\'S WORDS TO PRESIDENT BUSH. WHEN POPE JOHN PAUL II </p><p>MET THE PRESIDENT JULY 23 HE CONDEMNED THE "CREATION FOR </p><p>RESEARCH PURPOSES OF HUMAN EMBRYOS." NAVARRO-VALLS SAID JULY </p><p>25 THAT THE POPE WAS NOT OPENING THE POSSIBILITY OF AN </p><p>ETHICAL USE AND DESTRUCTION OF EMBRYOS CREATED FOR OTHER </p><p>PURPOSES. BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE CITED AS SAYING </p><p>THE POPE\'S WORDS, WHILE CLEARLY REFERRING TO EMBRYOS CREATED </p><p>FOR RESEARCH, MIGHT NOT COVER OTHER EMBRYOS, SUCH AS THOSE </p><p>CREATED FOR IN VITRO FERTILIZATION BUT NOT IMPLANTED IN A </p><p>UTERUS. NAVARRO-VALLS STATED THAT THE DELIBERATE DESTRUCTION </p><p>OF A HUMAN EMBRYO - NO MATTER HOW OR WHY IT WAS CREATED - IS </p><p>MORALLY UNACCEPTABLE, EVEN IF THE AIM IS TO HELP OTHERS. </p><p>(NOTE. WHEN A VATICAN-BASED JOURNALIST ACCUSED NAVARRO-VALLS </p><p>OF PUTTING HIS OWN "SPIN" ON THE POPE\'S SPEECH, HE RETORTED, </p><p>"NO, IT IS NOT SPIN, IT IS THE TRUTH." END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>VATICAN NEWS AGENCY: OLYMPICS OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE CHINA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.   THE DIRECTOR OF VATICAN MISSIONARY NEWS AGENCY "FIDES," </p><p>FATHER BERNARDO CERVELLERA, SUPPORTS BEIJING HOSTING THE </p><p>2008 OLYMPIC GAMES. IN A JULY 13 STATEMENT, CERVELLERA SAID </p><p>REFUSING TO GIVE CHINA THE GAMES WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>UNPRODUCTIVE AND HYPOCRITICAL. HE POINTED OUT THAT AUSTRALIA </p><p>HAD BEEN AWARDED THE 2000 OLYMPICS DESPITE A LONG HISTORY OF </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AGAINST ITS ABORIGINAL POPULATION. </p><p>CERVELLERA SAID THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES WOULD PROBABLY USE </p><p>THE GAMES "AS A SORT OF DRUG TO SOFTEN THE HARDSHIPS OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03976  01 OF 02  282136Z </p><p>COMING YEARS" AS IT FACES ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES. HOWEVER, </p><p>ACCORDING TO CERVELLERA, A TIME OF HARDSHIP AND STRUGGLE IS </p><p>NOT WHEN A NATION SHOULD BE IGNORED - RATHER IT IS A TIME TO </p><p>ENGAGE IT. "THE ALTERNATIVE IS ISOLATION, WHICH WOULD ALLOW </p><p>THE REGIME TO COMPLETELY SUFFOCATE ALL DISSIDENCE," HE SAID. </p><p>THE PRIEST ADDED THAT WHILE CHINA WAS LIKELY TO INCREASE </p><p>SECURITY MEASURES DURING THE GAMES, THERE IS NO WAY IT CAN </p><p>PREVENT INTERACTION BETWEEN CHINESE CITIZENS AND THE TENS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF ATHLETES AND TOURISTS WHO WILL TRAVEL TO </p><p>BEIJING FOR THE OLYMPICS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>NEW BISHOPS FOR VIETNAM </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.

THE VATICAN PRESS OFFICE HAS CONFIRMED POPE JOHN PAUL </p><p>II\'S SEPTEMBER 22-27 VISIT TO ARMENIA AND KAZAKHSTAN.  THE </p><p>LEADER OF THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH, CATHOLICOS KAREKIN </p><p>II OF ETCHMIADZIN, INVITED THE POPE TO JOIN IN CELEBRATIONS </p><p>IN HONOR OF THE 1,700TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE </p><p>NATION.  THE VISIT WILL INCLUDE CEREMONIES WITH MINORITY </p><p>CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS IMPORTANT ECUMENICAL EVENTS. </p><p>(NOTE. THE VATICAN HAS A WARM RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ARMENIAN </p><p>APOSTOLIC CHURCH (ONE OF SIX INDEPENDENT ORIENTAL ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCHES) AND SEVERAL DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCES HAVE ALREADY </p><p>BEEN RESOLVED. MANY ECUMENISTS REGARD THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN </p><p>THE VATICAN AND THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH AS A MODEL FOR </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER ORTHODOX CHURCHES. MUCH OF THE </p><p>SUCCESS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CLOSE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN POPE </p><p>JOHN PAUL II AND THE LATE CATHOLICOS, KAREKIN I.
