<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001991 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/WCI - PROSPER, IO - WARLICK, L/AF - TAFT, </p><p>INR/WCAD - SEIDENSTRICKER/MORIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 FIVE YEARS AFTER CLOSURE OF ICTY </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, NL, ICTY, ICTR </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTR: SEEKING INFORMATION ON THE DEPUTY PROSECUTOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 224968 </p><p> </p><p>     B. PROSPER-KAYE E-MAIL 8/5/03 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Legal Counselor David Kaye, reasons 1.5(b) and (d </p><p>). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: Dutch MFA officials responsible for </p><p>following the international criminal tribunals for the Former </p><p>Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR) said that, given their </p><p>lack of experience working with him, they were not in a </p><p>position to provide an assessment of the current ICTR deputy </p><p>prosecutor\'s ability to act as interim chief prosecutor.  Two </p><p>senior officials at the ICTY, however, offered in confidence </p><p>their assessments of his abilities.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a meeting with Embassy legal officer on August 6, </p><p>MFA legal adviser Johan Lammers and senior officer in the UN </p><p>and IFIs department Thijs Buchli said that the MFA did not </p><p>have enough contact with ICTR deputy prosecutor Bongani </p><p>Christopher Majola to provide a definitive assessment of his </p><p>skills.  Noting that some key officers who might have </p><p>thoughts on Majola were on leave, Lammers and Buchli said </p><p>they were nonetheless familiar with the UNSYG\'s proposal to </p><p>appoint a separate chief prosecutor for the ICTR, on which </p><p>they expressed no official position.  They were concerned, </p><p>however, that the position not remain empty for any </p><p>significant period of time.  In particular, they believed </p><p>that leaving the position empty, or simply enabling Majola to </p><p>act in an interim capacity for an extended period, could </p><p>leave the wrong impression that the ICTY would be "taken care </p><p>of" while the ICTR remained without leadership.  Buchli in </p><p>particular urged that, whatever the decision, it be made </p><p>quickly so as to avoid such an impression. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Two slightly diverging views were expressed by two </p><p>senior ICTY prosecutors on August 7.  Drawing from ref B, </p><p>emboff asked Chief of Prosecutions Michael Johnson and Deputy </p><p>Prosecutor Graham Blewitt, as asides in separate private </p><p>conversations, whether they had any reaction to the UNSYG\'s </p><p>proposal that Majola act as chief prosecutor for some interim </p><p>period.  Johnson (strictly protect), who served as acting </p><p>deputy prosecutor for the ICTR in the fall and led the effort </p><p>to hire Majola, believes that Majola has extraordinary skills </p><p>and is doing superb work at the ICTR.  Still, he does not </p><p>believe that Majola has the political or managerial skills to </p><p>run the ICTR Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) as chief </p><p>prosecutor.  The lack of prosecutorial experience did not </p><p>appear as a problem to Johnson, particularly as the position </p><p>requires as much special political skills in dealing with the </p><p>Rwandan government, victims and witnesses, and others. </p><p>Johnson simply believes that Majola, perhaps as much out of </p><p>inexperience as any other factor, lacks the political </p><p>abilities to run a Tribunal that should play a stabilizing </p><p>role in regional relations.  (Note: Johnson -- a natural </p><p>candidate for the job with deep experience with and </p><p>commitment to the ICTR -- disclaimed any interest in the job </p><p>himself, though we understand from a diplomatic colleague </p><p>here that he has recently expressed openness to it. End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Blewitt (strictly protect) said that he had not worked </p><p>enough with Majola to provide extensive or definitive views. </p><p>He echoed Johnson\'s views suggesting that Majola lacks the </p><p>necessary political experience.  That said, he suggested that </p><p>if both Majola and senior ICTR/OTP official Melanie Werrett </p><p>were promoted -- he to chief prosecutor and she to deputy -- </p><p>they might make an effective team, particularly since </p><p>Werrett, who has long experience as a prosecutor in the ICTR, </p><p>the UK and Zimbabwe, could compensate for Majola\'s </p><p>inexperience as a prosecutor.  He noted as an example that he </p><p>and Judge Richard Goldstone, the first chief prosecutor of </p><p>the ICTY, enjoyed a very productive relationship in part </p><p>because he, Blewitt, brought extensive prosecutorial </p><p>experience while Goldstone, not a prosecutor, brought </p><p>political and other skills to the job. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
