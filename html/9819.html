A key indicator of whether Mugabe takes this </p><p>initiative seriously will be the ZANU-PF position document, </p><p>if it is submitted, and if it is reasonable.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Tsvangirai on Bishops\' Meeting with Mugabe </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a meeting with the Ambassador on July 29, MDC </p><p>President Morgan Tsvangirai confirmed much of what was </p><p>reported (Ref A) on the meeting between President Mugabe and </p><p>the Manicaland Bishops on July 25.  He added that the meeting </p><p>lasted about two hours.  Tsvangirai said that initially Vice </p><p>President Joseph Msika poo pooed the MDC, calling them </p><p>puppets of Bush and Blair.  The Bishops argued that the </p><p>country could not afford to proceed on its present course, </p><p>and that they were actually helping the GOZ.  The Bishops </p><p>asked Mugabe what it would take for him to meet Tsvangirai. </p><p>Mugabe suggested what terms were necessary (Ref A).  The </p><p>Bishops responded that the court challenge was immaterial to </p><p>the impasse between the two parties.  When the discussion </p><p>turned to the possibility of a unity government, Roman </p><p>Catholic Bishop Patrick Mutume mentioned that they would </p><p>oppose any deal in which ZANU-PF swallowed MDC, noting he had </p><p>been involved in the interparty talks in 1987 when ZANU-PF </p><p>swallowed ZAPU. </p><p> </p><p>Way Forward </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Tsvangirai said there were no sticking points in the </p><p>MDC discussion with the Bishops on July 28.  The Bishops said </p><p>they would remain in the process until the end.  They said a </p><p>next step would be to explain to the South African Government </p><p>that they were taking this role.  The idea was raised during </p><p>the MDC-Bishops\' meeting that the discussion with ZANU-PF </p><p>could start on constitutional issues, as a way of avoiding </p><p>the legitimacy issue.  The two sides agreed to submit </p><p>documents to the Bishops outlining their positions.  The </p><p>Bishops said they would compare the two and come up with an </p><p>outline for negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Contrary to speculation in the local press, Tsvangirai </p><p>confirmed to the Ambassador that the MDC plans to pursue its </p><p>challenge of the March 2002 in court (currently scheduled for </p><p>November 3).  However, pursuing that case could become </p><p>irrelevant depending on the amount of progress on talks with </p><p>ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>South Africa as Guarantor </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Tsvangirai also said that South African High </p><p>Commissioner Jeremiah Ndou had phoned him to pass along </p><p>President Mbeki\'s thanks for Tsvangirai going to the opening </p><p>of Parliament on July 22.  Tsvangirai told the Ambassador </p><p>that the Bishops do not want to exclude South Africa from the </p><p>mediation process, and that they could play an important role </p><p>as a guarantor.  Tsvangirai said the Bishops would send a </p><p>team to South Africa soon to brief the SAG directly. </p><p>Tsvangirai said that MDC was speaking with civil society </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>colleagues, such as the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions </p><p>(ZCTU) to firm up alliances.  None of MDC\'s civil society </p><p>allies opposed exploring prospects for dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>US Backing Needed </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Tsvangirai asked the Ambassador if the USG could help </p><p>to ensure South African accountability to better guarantee </p><p>the negotiations make progress, and also to put pressure on </p><p>ZANU-PF to be sincere.  Tsvangirai mentioned that incidents </p><p>of violence were still being perpetrated on MDC candidates </p><p>(Ref B) and if ZANU-PF was sincere about reaching common </p><p>ground, these should stop.  Tsvangirai said that the MDC was </p><p>raising the need to end political violence with Justice </p><p>Minister Patrick Chinamasa rather than making such cessation </p><p>a pre-condition for talks.  Similarly, the MDC was </p><p>petitioning the courts to re-open the nomination process in </p><p>those urban councils where MDC was excluded (Ref B).  MDC </p><p>would avoid setting any pre-conditions for dialogue in order </p><p>to keep the pressure on ZANU-PF to agree to unconditional </p><p>dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The next important step is the position documents from </p><p>each side.  We have no doubt the MDC will follow through with </p><p>theirs; however it is unclear whether and how Mugabe\'s team </p><p>will follow through on their side.  This will be a key </p><p>indicator of whether Mugabe might actually take this effort </p><p>seriously.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
