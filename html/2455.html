<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000560 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PINR, PREL, AL, IT, JO, MZ, TS, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S CALL ON MINISTER FOR INNOVATION AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) IN HIS COURTESY CALL ON MINISTER FOR INNOVATION AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGY STANCA, THE AMBASSADOR EXPLORED ITALIAN HIGH-TECH, </p><p>PROMOTED THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER AS HONING THE ITALIAN EDGE </p><p>IN DESIGN AND ENGINEERING, AND SOUGHT AN ALLY IN THE BIOTECH </p><p>DEBATES.   MINISTER STANCA, CAUTIOUS IN HIS NEWLY ESTABLISHED </p><p>MINISTRY, EMPHASIZED E-GOVERNMENT, ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>UNDER-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, AND ONLINE EDUCATION AND MEDICAL </p><p>SUPPORT.  STANCA IS HOSTING A G8-INSPIRED CONFERENCE ON THE </p><p>DIGITAL DIVIDE IN PALERMO IN APRIL WHERE HE WOULD LIKE TO </p><p>PRESENT THE RESULTS OF HIS VISITS TO ALBANIA, TUNISIA AND </p><p>JORDAN.  BASED ON NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY THE THREE GOVERNMENTS, </p><p>ITALY WILL HELP ALBANIA DIGITIZE ITS NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, </p><p>ASSIST TUNISIA WITH LAND REGISTRY AND SHOW JORDAN HOW TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT AN ONLINE TAX PROGRAM SO THAT CITIZENS CAN PAY </p><p>THEIR TAXES ONLINE.  A PROGRAM HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED </p><p>FOR MOZAMBIQUE.  STANCA WOULD LIKE TO COME TO WASHINGTON TO </p><p>DISCUSS BEST PRACTICES IN E-GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NEW MINISTRY </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR CALLED ON LUCIO STANCA, MINISTER </p><p>WITHOUT PORTFOLIO FOR INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY, WEDNESDAY, </p><p>JANUARY 30.  ALSO PRESENT WERE DCM POPE, ECMIN DEAN AND </p><p>STANCA\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, STEFANO GATTI.  THE MINISTRY IS </p><p>NEW WITH THE BERLUSCONI ADMINISTRATION, EXPANDING AND </p><p>EMPHASIZING A PORTFOLIO HELD IN PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS BY AN </p><p>UNDER-SECRETARY OR ADVISOR IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY THE MINISTRY HAS BEEN GIVEN THE MANDATE TO </p><p>IMPROVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR.  GIVEN THAT HIS OBJECTIVE IS TO COMPUTERIZE </p><p>ALL GOVERNMENT SERVICES, STANCA WANTS TO CREATE ONLINE </p><p>PORTALS FOR ALL GOVERNMENT SERVICES OFFERED BY NATIONAL, </p><p>REGIONAL, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  IN THIS CAPACITY, STANCA </p><p>RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF VISITING THE U.S. IN THE LATE </p><p>SPRING OR EARLY FALL TO LOOK AT OUR E-GOVERNMENT PROCESS AND </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  HE FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT "IN THE NEXT 12 </p><p>MONTHS, HE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE BEST (E-GOVERNMENT) </p><p>PRACTICES", PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND </p><p>HEALTH.  (COMMENT:  WE LOOK AT THIS MINISTRY AS HAVING A </p><p>POSITIVE POTENTIAL TO ADVANCE TECH ISSUES WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND WITHIN ITALY.  WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS </p><p>UNDER-FUNDED AND UNDERSTAFFED MINISTRY REMAINS TO BE SEEN.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) IN THIS POSITIVE SPIRIT OF POSSIBLY FINDING A NEW </p><p>ALLY IN THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD, THE AMBASSADOR RAISED A BROAD </p><p>RANGE OF TECHNOLOGY ISSUES:  FROM BIOTECHNOLOGY AND THE NEED </p><p>FOR SCIENTISTS TO DO BASIC RESEARCH, SUCH AS CONDUCT FIELD </p><p>TRIALS (WHICH ARE NOW PROHIBITED) TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF </p><p>MAINTAINING THE HIGH-TECH SKILLS OF ITALIAN SCIENTISTS AND </p><p>ENGINEERS IN DESIGNING AND PRODUCING COMPONENTS OF THE JOINT </p><p>STRIKE FIGHTER TO PARTICIPATION IN THE CRITICAL </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE CONFERENCE THE POST IS HOSTING IN APRIL. </p><p>WHILE STANCA, A 36-YEAR EMPLOYEE OF IBM, WAS CAUTIOUS ABOUT </p><p>TREADING ON THE TURF OF HIS FELLOW MINISTERS, HE CLEARLY </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THE DISADVANTAGES OF ITALY\'S BEING LEFT BEHIND IN </p><p>THE TECHNOLOGY RACE.  HE THOUGHT THAT MINISTER MORATTI, </p><p>MINISTER OF CULTURE AND RESEARCH, WOULD BE A NATURAL ALLY ON </p><p>RESTARTING BIOTECH RESEARCH.  HE WAS ALSO ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT </p><p>DISTANCE BIO-MEDICAL SUPPORT, WHICH WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY FOR </p><p>ITALY TO HELP UNDER-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.  STANCA IS EVIDENTLY </p><p>NEW TO THE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY, BUT PREPARED TO MOVE </p><p>CAUTIOUSLY IN HIS AREA.  AS VICE-CHAIR OF THE ASPEN </p><p>INSTITUTE, HE THOUGHT THAT THE INSTITUTE COULD BE A FORUM TO </p><p>EXPLORE BIOTECH DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>DIGITAL DIVIDE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) STANCA ALSO RAISED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AS AN AREA </p><p>WHERE ITALY COULD DO MORE TO HELP UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES. </p><p>(COMMENT: THE GOI HEADS THE G8 DOT FORCE ON THE DIGITAL </p><p>DIVIDE.  AT BOTH THE 1999 OKINAWA AND 2001 GENOA SUMMIT, THE </p><p>G8 LEADERS CONFIRMED THEIR COMMITMENT TO BRIDGING THIS </p><p>DIGITAL DIVIDE.  THE GOI IS WORKING TO PUT INTO OPERATION A </p><p>PLAN OF ACTION.  END COMMENT.)  HE STRESSED THAT ITALY GIVES </p><p>ONLY 0.13 PERCENT OF ITS GDP IN FINANCIAL AID AND THAT THIS </p><p>WAS WELL BELOW THE EU TARGET.  STANCA SAID THAT HE AND ITALY </p><p>WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ITALIAN RESOURCES ARE WELL SPENT; IT </p><p>WOULD INCREASE THEIR CREDIBILITY IF THE GOI CAN IMPROVE </p><p>FOREIGN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE GOI WILL HOST A CONFERENCE, IN CONJUNCTION WITH </p><p>THE UN, NGOS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, ON THE </p><p>DIGITAL DIVIDE IN EARLY APRIL.  STANCA PLANS TO HIGHLIGHT A </p><p>PILOT PROGRAM AMONG THE GOI AND FOUR COUNTRIES, ALBANIA, </p><p>TUNISIA, JORDAN, AND MOZAMBIQUE.  STANCA HAD JUST RETURNED </p><p>FROM VISITING THE FIRST THREE.  AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH EACH </p><p>GOVERNMENT, WHICH INCLUDED PRESENTING A MENU OF THE SPECIFIC </p><p>TYPES OF ASSISTANCE ITALY COULD PROVIDE, STANCA HAD THEM </p><p>IDENTIFY THEIR TOP PRIORITY FOR E-GOVERNMENT.  SPECIFICALLY </p><p>ITALY WILL HELP ALBANIA DIGITIZE ITS NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, WHICH </p><p>ARE STILL BEING KEPT BY HAND.  THE GOI WILL ASSIST TUNISIA </p><p>WITH ITS LAND REGISTRY PROGRAM.  (COMMENT:  WE BELIEVE THIS </p><p>WILL PROVIDE STABILITY AND CONFIDENCE, ALLOW LEGAL SALES AND </p><p>TRANSFERS, AND PERMIT OWNERS TO DRAW ON THE CAPITAL IN THEIR </p><p>LAND THROUGH MORTGAGE BORROWING TO HELP CAPITALIZE OTHER </p><p>INVESTMENT.  END COMMENT.)  AND ITALY WILL HELP JORDAN WITH </p><p>AN ONLINE TAX PROGRAM SO THAT PRIVATE AND CORPORATE CITIZENS </p><p>CAN PAY ALL THEIR TAXES ONLINE.  STANCA REPORTED THAT THE EU </p><p>HAD RECOGNIZED ITALY\'S PAPERLESS TAXPAYER SYSTEM WITH AN </p><p>AWARD FOR BEST PROGRAM.  WITH MOZAMBIQUE, ITALY IS WORKING ON </p><p>IDENTIFYING PRACTICAL NEEDS THAT THE NEW INNOVATION MINISTRY </p><p>CAN TAKE ON. </p><p> </p><p>BIO </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) BORN IN LUCERA ON OCTOBER 20, 1941, STANCA HAS A </p><p>DEGREE IN ECONOMICS FROM MILAN\'S BOCCONI UNIVERSITY.  HE </p><p>BEGAN HIS CAREER IN COMPUTER INFORMATION, JOINING IBM AS A </p><p>SALES TECHNICIAN IN 1968.  HE RETIRED FROM HIS POSITION AS </p><p>CEO, IBM (EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA) IN 2001.  STANCA IS </p><p>ALSO VICE CHAIR OF THE ASPEN INSTITUTE, ITALY, AND ON THE </p><p>COUNCIL FOR THE U.S. AND ITALY.  HE SPEAKS EXCELLENT ENGLISH </p><p>AND IS MARRIED TO FRANCESCA CANEPA. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00560 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
