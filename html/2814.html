<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000795 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>LONDON FOR RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, CASC, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: FIRST DAY OF MAOIST STRIKE QUIET </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 788 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The streets of Kathmandu were </p><p>comparatively quiet during the first day of the five-day </p><p>general strike called by Maoist insurgents April 23-27.  Most </p><p>city shops remained closed, and public transportation was </p><p>sparse.  Most vehicles on the road bore either diplomatic </p><p>plates or Government of Nepal plates--with the occupants of </p><p>the latter vehicles generally security personnel.  A core EAC </p><p>convened the late afternoon of April 23 to review the </p><p>situation to date and plans for the following day.  As it did </p><p>today, the Embassy plans to operate as usual April 24.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>DAY ONE:  RAINY AND SUBDUED </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Kathmandu city streets were comparatively quiet the </p><p>first day of the five-day general strike, or "bandh," called </p><p>by the Maoists April 23-27.  About 90 percent of the shops in </p><p>town remained closed, and public transporation (apart from a </p><p>few intrepid taxis with paper taped over their license plates </p><p>to avoid identification) was sparse.  Most vehicles on the </p><p>road bore diplomatic license plates or the Government of </p><p>Nepal plates given to official vehicles--and many of the </p><p>latter were carrying police or army troops, rather than civil </p><p>servants.  Pedestrian traffic was somewhat light--due in part </p><p>perhaps to persistent rain throughout the day. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  As of COB April 23, the Embassy had received </p><p>comparatively few reports of security incidents in the </p><p>capital and its environs. The previous night suspected </p><p>insurgents threw a socket bomb at the home of a Royal Nepal </p><p>Army colonel; security forces successfully defused the bomb </p><p>and no injuries were reported.  In a similar incident the </p><p>same night, suspected Maoists threw another socket bomb at a </p><p>police post in the Pulchowk area of the city.  Early the </p><p>morning of April 23, a petrol bomb was thrown at a mini bus </p><p>in Lalitpur in the Kathmandu metropolitan area.  The bomb </p><p>exploded in front of a police station, injuring one policeman </p><p>on duty.  Outside of Kathmandu, in Rautahat District the </p><p>night of April 22, suspected insurgents set fire to two </p><p>different buses.  No injuries were reported. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) A quick survey of Chief District Officers (CDOs) in </p><p>several outlying districts revealed varying degrees of </p><p>observance of the bandh across the country.  In Jhapa in the </p><p>eastern part of the country, the CDO reported that no </p><p>vehicles were in operation, and only a few shops open.  In </p><p>Kavre, six buses were operating--but only after being given a </p><p>police escort.  The CDO said only a few shops were open in </p><p>his district capital as well.  Three buses reached Tanahu </p><p>District from outlying districts, according to CDO Khumraj </p><p>Panjuli, but no other vehicles were moving.  Nearly all the </p><p>shops in Tanahu\'s two largest towns were open, he said.  In </p><p>Bardia few vehicles were running, but most shops were open in </p><p>the district headquarters.  Similarly, in the district </p><p>headquarters of Baglung, most shops were open but few </p><p>vehicles running.  The CDO of Nuwakot, Mathabar Kumar </p><p>Adhikari, reported that his office had successfully organized </p><p>a peace rally in the morning.  Most vehicles were running, he </p><p>asserted, and shops open.  None of the CDOs contacted </p><p>reported any violent incidents during the day. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>EMBASSY ACTIONS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Embassy remained open with normal working hours </p><p>throughout the day, although FSN shuttles were directed to </p><p>run a few hours later than usual.  The majority of FSNs, </p><p>however, elected to walk to work, rather than ride the </p><p>shuttle.  The international school and the British school </p><p>were closed; we understand the international school has </p><p>decided to remain closed April 24 as well.  A core EAC met at </p><p>COB April 23 to review the security situation and assess </p><p>probable conditions for the following day.  It was decided </p><p>that the Embassy will observe normal working hours April 24, </p><p>and that FSN shuttles will begin operation two hours later </p><p>than usual. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Given the events of the past several weeks, the </p><p>first day of this widely publicized bandh was comparatively </p><p>quieter, with far fewer reports of security incidents, than </p><p>preceding non-bandh days.  The dismal, rainy weather may have </p><p>played some role in this.  That said, the general population </p><p>in Kathmandu largely observed the strike, despite calls by </p><p>the government, the security forces, and political parties to </p><p>ignore it.  Although fear, rather than support for Maoist </p><p>ideology, is obviously the greatest factor influencing </p><p>individual decisions to observe the bandh, the Maoists will </p><p>nonetheless claim victory, at least for this first day. </p><p>Whether the comparative quiet of the first day will embolden </p><p>people to flout the strike the second or following days </p><p>remains to be seen.  The Embassy will continue to monitor its </p><p>security posture. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
