<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001960 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA A/S WILLIAM BURNS AND NEA DAS DAVID SATTERFIELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: IT, PREL, KPAL, EAID, IS, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ISRAELI DISTRUST OF ITALIAN CONFERENCE ON </p><p>PALESTINIAN REFORM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 1647 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 1910 </p><p></p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR MEL SEMBLER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ISRAELI EMBASSY DCM AMOS RADIAN EXPRESSED TO POL MC ON </p><p>APRIL 30 HIS EMBASSY\'S RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE MFA-SPONSORED </p><p>CONFERENCE ON PALESTINIAN REFORM AND ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>TO BE HELD IN ROME MAY 28-29 (REF A).  RADIAN ARGUED </p><p>VARIOUSLY THAT: </p><p>-- ITALY IS TRYING TO INSERT THE EU INTO A MORE PROMINENT </p><p>ROLE IN ROADMAP IMPLEMENTATION AND NEGOTIATION THAN ISRAEL </p><p>CAN ACCEPT. </p><p>-- THE EU AND OTHERS WILL SEIZE ON THE CONFERENCE TO ARGUE </p><p>THAT ABU MAZEN\'S ELECTION MEANS PALESTINIAN OBLIGATIONS UNDER </p><p>THE ROADMAP ARE FULFILLED AND THAT ALL PRESSURE MUST NOW BE </p><p>PLACED ON ISRAEL. </p><p>-- THE CONFERENCE WILL EVOLVE INTO A FORCED NEGOTIATION OVER </p><p>THE ROADMAP. </p><p>POL MC REPLIED THAT HE FOUND NOTHING IN THE INFORMATION WE </p><p>HAD ABOUT THE PROPOSED CONFERENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE ANY OF </p><p>THOSE CONCERNS.  SOMETIMES, A CONFERENCE IS JUST A CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON MAY 2, ISRAELI AMB. GOL REPEATED SOME OF THE SAME </p><p>ARGUMENTS TO AMB. SEMBLER.  HE SAID THAT THE EMBASSY IS </p><p>RECOMMENDING TO THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT THAT THERE BE NO </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL ATTENDACE FROM ISRAEL.  HE URGED AMB. SEMBLER TO </p><p>DISCOURAGE A/S BURNS FROM ACCEPTING THE ITALIAN INVITATION. </p><p>AMB. SEMBLER SAID HE WOULD REPORT AMB. GOL\'S CONCERNS. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE US EMBASSY DID NOT SHARE THE SAME SUSPICIONS </p><p>ABOUT THE ITALIAN MOTIVES, AND CONTINUED TO BELIEVE IT VERY </p><p>VALUABLE FOR A/S BURNS TO CONSULT HERE BEFORE ITALY ASSUMES </p><p>THE EU PRESIDENCY IN JULY. </p><p></p><p>3. (C) ON MAY 5, NEA WATCHER MET WITH LUCA FERRARI, THE MFA\'S </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR ISRAELI/PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS, TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE CONFERENCE.  FERRARI SAID THAT RADIAN HAD JUST EXPRESSED </p><p>HIS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE CONFERENCE TO HIM BUT ASSURED HIM </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL WOULD NOT OPPOSE IT BY DENYING </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS TRAVEL PERMITS.  IN WHAT SEEMED TO BE A MORE </p><p>MEASURED TONE THAN THE ONE USED WITH THE POL MC, RADIAN TOLD </p><p>FERRARI HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CONFERENCE FOR </p><p>THE PURPOSES OF ITALIAN PUBLIC OPINION AND AS A PREPARATION </p><p>FOR ITALY\'S PRESIDENCY OF THE EU.  THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL, </p><p>SAID RADIAN, WOULD PROBABLY SEND A SPEAKER, BUT NOT A </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, FOR THE SECOND DAY\'S DISCUSSION ON </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PALESTINIAN ECONOMY (THE FIRST DAY WILL </p><p>FOCUS ON POLITICAL REFORM OF THE PALESTINIAN NATIONAL </p><p>AUTHORITY).  FERRARI INSISTED TO RADIAN AND TO US THAT THIS </p><p>IS INDEED A "CONFERENCE" ON PALESTINIAN REFORM AND NOT A </p><p>POLITICAL MEETING OR A NEGOTIATION ON THE ROADMAP.  HE </p><p>REITERATED TO RADIAN AND TO US THAT, WITHIN THE QUARTET, </p><p>ITALY INTENDS TO COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH THE US. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) FERRARI SAID THAT ABU MAZEN WILL NOT ATTEND THE </p><p>CONFERENCE.  HOWEVER, HE EXPECTS OTHER KEY PALESTINIAN </p><p>FIGURES: SALAM FAYAD, HANAN NASR, AL-MASRI (ALL CONFIRMED) </p><p>AND ABD RABO (PROBABLE).  BESIDES MORATINOS, HE HAS </p><p>CONFIRMATION FROM A/S BURNS COUNTERPARTS FROM RUSSIA (DOVIN) </p><p>AND GERMANY (TRAUTWEIN), AND IS HOPEFUL TO GET THE SAME FROM </p><p>THE UK AND FRANCE.  FERRARI WOULD HOPE TO HOLD QUINT </p><p>CONSULTATIONS, IDEALLY INVOLVING A USG REP, ON THE MARGINS OF </p><p>THE CONFERENCE.  AT THIS POINT, TERJE LARSEN\'S ATTENDANCE IS </p><p>DOUBTFUL.  IF HE DOES ATTEND, FERRARI SAID THE ITALIAN </p><p>    GOVERNMENT WOULD BE HAPPY TO FACILITATE A MEETING PLACE FOR </p><p>INFORMAL QUARTET DISCUSSION.  ALTHOUGH ROME IS KEEPING THE </p><p>GREEK GOVERNMENT, AS EU PRESIDENT, FULLY INFORMED, HE DOES </p><p>NOT EXPECT GREEK FM PAPANDREOU TO ATTEND. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE THE </p><p>VALIDITY OF THE ISRAELI CONCERNS, BUT REPORT THEM IN CASE </p><p>ISRAEL IS MAKING ITS CASE AGAINST ATTENDANCE DIRECTLY IN </p><p>WASHINGTON.  WE ARE IN A POSITION TO JUDGE THE ITALIAN </p><p>APPROACH TO THE PEACE PROCESS.  WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE MORE </p><p>BALANCED BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS, AND MORE </p><p>CAREFULLY COORDINATED WITH THE USG POSITION, THAN THAT OF ANY </p><p>RECENT EU PRESIDENT.  EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF A/S BURNS OR OF DAS DAVID SATTERFIELD (WHO </p><p>WE UNDERSTAND COULD BE IN EUROPE IN THIS TIME FRAME) IN THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WOULD BE HIGHLY BENEFICIAL AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>CONSULT WITH SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS PRIOR TO ITALY BECOMING THE </p><p>EU PRESIDENT JULY 1. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01960 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
