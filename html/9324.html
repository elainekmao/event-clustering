Informal talks proposed for July 11 between Nepal </p><p>Government and Maoist negotiators failed to materialize, </p><p>amid continuing controversy over the terms of agreements </p><p>allegedly reached during the second round of talks (Reftel). </p><p>As peace talks remain stalled, senior Maoists declared that </p><p>they are preparing for both talks and war.  Sir Jeffrey </p><p>James, the British special envoy to Nepal, said his </p><p>government supports peace in Nepal, but also pledged </p><p>continued assistance to Nepal\'s security forces to counter </p><p>Maoist attacks.  A former Maoist commander claims that </p><p>Maoists are "stretched to the limit," and are using anti- </p><p>American rhetoric as a means of securing their own refuge in </p><p>neighboring India.  A weekly report issued on July 4 by the </p><p>Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a local human rights </p><p>organization, showed that 199 people have been abducted by </p><p>the Maoists since the declaration of the ceasefire on </p><p>January 29.  Amnesty International (AI) claimed that the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) and the Maoists are not serious </p><p>about the peace negotiations.  Maoist attacks on security </p><p>personnel and civilians continue, including the severe </p><p>beating of three civilians that killed one and injured two </p><p>others, and the obstruction of infrastructure projects. </p><p>According to the National Planning Commission (NPC), a </p><p>program that aims to enhance security and development </p><p>projects in Maoist affected districts will be expanded in </p><p>the next fiscal year.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>PROPOSED DATE PASSES WITHOUT TALKS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Despite attempts to bring representatives from the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) and Maoist negotiating teams to </p><p>the table on June 11, no such meeting occurred.  Padma Ratna </p><p>Tuladhar, Maoist appointed peace talks facilitator, said on </p><p>July 8 that the GON and the Maoists would meet informally on </p><p>Friday, July 11.  Tuladhar, speaking at the Reporter\'s Club, </p><p>said uncertainty remained over the implementation of </p><p>agreements allegedly reached during the second round of </p><p>negotiations (Reftel), but that both sides claimed they were </p><p>committed to peace.  He also suggested that the King </p><p>intervene to initiate the third round, and allow Maoist </p><p>leaders to meet with him. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Representatives from the GON\'s and Maoists\' negotiation </p><p>teams, however, reportedly did meet on July 3 for informal </p><p>talks.  The GON was represented by Kamal Thapa, Minister of </p><p>Communications, and Dr. Prakash Chandra Lohani, Finance </p><p>Minister and GON team leader, while only two of the Maoists\' </p><p>negotiating team members, Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Ram </p><p>Bahadur Thapa (alias Badal), represented the Maoists.  Badal </p><p>reportedly demanded that the GON immediately implement </p><p>agreements regarding restricted deployment of the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army (RNA) allegedly reached during the second round </p><p>of talks.   However, as Minister Thapa has said as recently </p><p>as July 4, all decisions reached during the second round </p><p>were not final. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The controversial issue of the army\'s restriction to a 5- </p><p>kilometer radius from its barracks seemingly remains a major </p><p>obstacle.  The local press reports that the RNA remains </p><p>adamantly opposed to the idea, quoting an army official on </p><p>July 4 as saying that to implement it would be "surrendering </p><p>the very concept of national security."  In addition, </p><p>security forces want several issues put on the agenda for </p><p>the third round of talks, including the return of looted </p><p>weapons by the Maoists. </p><p>MAOISTS PREPARED FOR WAR OR PEACE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Due to apparent skepticism regarding the future of the </p><p>peace negotiations, Maoist leaders are preparing for other </p><p>options.  Badal, military chief of the Maoists, declared on </p><p>July 4 that the Maoists are preparing for both talks and </p><p>war.  Speaking at the general convention of the All-Nepal </p><p>National Independent Students\' Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU- </p><p>R), the Maoist affiliated student organization, Badal </p><p>claimed that security personnel are "unilaterally violating </p><p>the code of conduct," forcing the Maoists to prepare </p><p>themselves against any large-scale violence by the </p><p>government. (Note: Embassy has seen no evidence that the RNA </p><p>is violating the code of conduct in any systematic or </p><p>substantial way.  End note). </p><p> </p><p>6.  Local Maoist commanders in the eastern district of </p><p>Khotang reportedly have changed tactics too, warning that </p><p>they are capable of carrying out operations on their own, </p><p>regardless of "higher orders" from Maoist leaders. </p><p>According to Maoist commanders in the district, security </p><p>personnel have resumed security operations and openly harass </p><p>Maoist cadres.  The insurgents declared that they are </p><p>prepared to "face the problems on our own" and were ready </p><p>for any retaliation by security personnel.  The district </p><p>administration denied the insurgents\' claims, and said </p><p>security forces are on high alert only after the insurgents </p><p>extorted money from most of the government offices in the </p><p>district headquarters. </p><p> </p><p>BRITISH ENVOY PLEDGES CONTINUED SUPPORT TO GON </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>7.  In an interview on July 7 with the national news agency </p><p>of the GON, a senior official of the British Foreign and </p><p>Commonwealth Office said that his government wants to see </p><p>peace in Nepal and welcomes the sustained ceasefire.  The </p><p>official also said that Sir Jeffrey James, the British </p><p>special envoy to Nepal, has affirmed his government\'s </p><p>commitment to providing training and other non-lethal </p><p>assistance to Nepal\'s security forces to counter any </p><p>resumption of hostilities.  James reportedly warned against </p><p>the resumption of hostilities, declaring that it would have </p><p>a "devastating impact" on the lives of ordinary Nepalese. </p><p> </p><p>INSIGHT OF AN EX-MAOIST </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  A July 10 op-ed written by a former Maoist for a weekly </p><p>English language newspaper claims that Maoists are </p><p>"stretched to the limit" trying to maintain the morale of </p><p>their cadres, and agreed to a ceasefire because of American </p><p>pressure on India to deny Maoist leaders refuge there. </p><p>Puskar Gautam, a former Maoist commander and present member </p><p>of the left-wing Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (CPN-UML), claims that the Maoist leaders have </p><p>realized that the "people\'s war" is unacceptable to India </p><p>and impossible to sustain, and therefore, have adopted new </p><p>tactics.  The Maoists reportedly are trying to present </p><p>themselves as a party dedicated to peace, and Gautam </p><p>speculates that the "Prachanda Path" is developing into a </p><p>multi-party peoples\' movement because the insurgents need </p><p>assistance.  Gautam claims that the Maoists\' increased anti- </p><p>American rhetoric is an attempt to incite nationalism, alarm </p><p>security officials in Beijing and New Delhi, and ensure </p><p>refuge in India if peace negotiations fail. </p><p> </p><p>ABDUCTIONS RAMPANT DURING CEASEFIRE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  A weekly report issued on July 4 by the Informal Sector </p><p>Service Center (INSEC), a local human rights organization, </p><p>showed that 199 people have been abducted by Maoists since </p><p>the declaration of the ceasefire on January 29.  The highest </p><p>number of victims, twenty-four, were taken from the far- </p><p>eastern district of Taplejung.  The report states that </p><p>seventy-four people have been released, but 125 remain </p><p>missing.  Representatives from INSEC told the Embassy that </p><p>they were unable to obtain information regarding whether or </p><p>not ransom had been paid to secure the release of those set </p><p>free. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has cited </p><p>concern over human rights violations by the Maoists, </p><p>particularly the abductions of political activists, and sent </p><p>a letter to the Maoists on July 10 calling for the immediate </p><p>release of abductees.  NHRC also urged the Maoists to honor </p><p>their professed commitment to human rights. </p><p> </p><p>AI CLAIMS GON AND MAOISTS "NOT SERIOUS" </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Frustrated by failed attempts to meet with GON </p><p>representatives and Maoist negotiating team members, Ingrid </p><p>Massage, Deputy Director of the Asia-Pacific Regional </p><p>Program of Amnesty International (AI), said on July 6 that </p><p>neither the GON nor the Maoists was serious about human </p><p>rights.  She expressed disappointment that representatives </p><p>from the GON and Maoists did not meet visiting AI </p><p>representatives.  Massage also appealed to the public to put </p><p>pressure on both sides to sign a human rights agreement. </p><p> </p><p>ATTACKS ON SECURITY PERSONNEL </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  A platoon commander of the Maoists was arrested on July </p><p>8 for allegedly attacking police personnel in Rautahat </p><p>District.  In the far west district of Doti, five RNA </p><p>soldiers were wounded after being fired on by Maoists in a </p><p>confrontation on July 4.  According to a press statement </p><p>issued by the Defense Ministry, the soldiers were attacked </p><p>while patrolling the area.  On July 5 a Maoist activist in </p><p>custody in Accham District attempted to escape after </p><p>snatching a weapon from a soldier.  Security personnel fired </p><p>on the insurgent as he fled. </p><p> </p><p>13.  A team of joint security forces destroyed a Maoist </p><p>training camp in Panchthar District on July 8.  There were </p><p>no injuries reported as the insurgents had evacuated the </p><p>camp the prior week. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The local press reported on July 3 that Bangladesh </p><p>security agents seized a cache of ammunition and explosives </p><p>reportedly destined for use by Maoists throughout Nepal. </p><p>Over 90,000 bullets and almost two hundred kilograms of </p><p>explosives allegedly were seized from the homes of activists </p><p>from two of Bangladesh\'s prominent political parties. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST ATROCITIES CONTINUE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  Maoist cadres continue to ignore the code of conduct by </p><p>abducting, assaulting and killing civilians.  A district </p><p>committee secretary in Kalikot was physically assaulted in </p><p>public on July 6 and then abducted.  According to local </p><p>villagers, the insurgents have threatened to kill him. </p><p>Three former Maoists who returned to their homes in Dhankuta </p><p>District after surrendering to the district administration </p><p>allegedly were tortured severely by Maoists.  They </p><p>reportedly were abducted from their homes by armed Maoists </p><p>on July 4.  On the same day insurgents beat a civilian to </p><p>death and severely injured two others in Kailali District. </p><p>The insurgents justified their actions by claiming they were </p><p>avenging the death of one of their cadres. </p><p> </p><p>16.  In the southwestern district of Dang, a Maoist </p><p>stronghold, insurgents reportedly have taken control of over </p><p>half a dozen government offices.  According to local </p><p>villagers the insurgents are running the customs office and </p><p>collecting taxes.  They also have taken control of forest </p><p>offices, animal check posts, health posts, and post offices. </p><p>Maoists reportedly are using some of the offices as shelter </p><p>after government workers fled the area in fear.  (Note:  The </p><p>Maoists launched a brutal attack on the police post of </p><p>Koilabas in the district on December 18, 2002 after which </p><p>there has been no security personnel in the area.  End </p><p>note). </p><p> </p><p>17.  Maoists in Kailali District reportedly have halted the </p><p>construction of a bridge intended to facilitate travel </p><p>during monsoon season.  The bridge has been constructed </p><p>during monsoon season for the past two years with the </p><p>financial assistance of private American citizens and local </p><p>funds.  The insurgents declared that the bridge posed a </p><p>security threat to them. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN UNDERWAY </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  The Integrated Security and Development Program (ISDP), </p><p>which aims to enhance security and development projects in </p><p>Maoist affected districts, will be expanded in the next </p><p>fiscal year, according to the National Planning Commission </p><p>(NCP).  The program, currently implemented in Gorkha </p><p>District, will be expanded to include over twenty of the </p><p>most affected districts.  The program has enjoyed some </p><p>success in Gorkha, where security has been enhanced, </p><p>government services restored, and various infrastructure </p><p>facilities repaired, including schools and hospitals. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
