<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 002202 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, CE, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA: A REFORM-MINDED 2003 BUDGET </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Indicating government commitment to fiscal </p><p>discipline and continued reforms, the 2003 GSL budget </p><p>concentrated on improving the macro economic situation through </p><p>measures to narrow the budget deficit and public debt while </p><p>increasing tax revenue.  The fundamental weakness of the fiscal </p><p>situation remains, however; committed current expenditures </p><p>absorb all of government revenue, require heavy borrowings and </p><p>hold public investment below required levels.  The budget </p><p>foresees an improved macro economic situation and lower interest </p><p>rates (stemming from a lower government deficit) together </p><p>boosting private investment.  In addition, the budget proposed </p><p>to slightly expand tax holidays for investment and further </p><p>liberalize exchange controls.  Significantly, there were no </p><p>populist measures.  The budget was generally well received by </p><p>the business community; the opposition criticized it for a lack </p><p>of relief for the masses.  It represents a credible first step </p><p>toward fiscal stability.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Reign in Macro Economic fundamentals </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Minister of Finance, K N Choksy, presenting the GSL </p><p>budget for FY 2003 to Parliament on November 6, said it aims to </p><p>undo the defects of the past and build prosperity for the </p><p>future.  He said "our effort is to reform the economy in </p><p>parallel with the peace process" but warned that a spectacular </p><p>overnight recovery of the economy cannot be expected.  He </p><p>recalled that in the past, the people have judged governments </p><p>and budgets by the number of flowery promises they make.  He </p><p>asked that this government be judged by the results it delivers. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Under the United National Front (UNF) government, the </p><p>economy has already made a partial recovery from -1.3% dip in </p><p>2001.  Growth is projected at 3% in 2002, increasing to 5.5% in </p><p>2003.  Inflation has dropped from 14% in 2001 to about 9% in </p><p>2002.  Considerable progress has been made in reducing the </p><p>budget deficit from 10.9% of GDP in 2001 to 8.9% of GDP in 2002, </p><p>which is just 0.4% off the IMF target.  Deficit control, </p><p>however, has come at the cost of capital expenditure.  The </p><p>current account deficit expanded to 4.3% of GDP in 2002 from a </p><p>planned 3.4%. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Deficit to drop to 7.5% in 2003 </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The government commitment to strengthening macro economic </p><p>fundamentals was manifested by moves to reduce government </p><p>spending and increase revenue.  GSL hopes a new Fiscal </p><p>Management Law will ensure fiscal prudence and an Economic </p><p>Management Law will help ministries track economic reforms.  The </p><p>2003 budget calls for total spending (and net lending) of Rs. </p><p>438 billion ($4.5 billion), or 24.6% of GDP.  Revenues are </p><p>projected at Rs. 304 billion ($3.2 billion) or 17.1% of GDP, </p><p>implying a budget deficit of Rs. 134 billion ($1.4 billion), or </p><p>7.5% of GDP.  The contraction in the deficit from last year\'s </p><p>levels, equivalent to about 1.4% of GDP, stems from both an </p><p>increase in revenue and a reduction in current expenditure.  The </p><p>Government still runs a large current account deficit of 2.3% of </p><p>GDP.  The overall deficit is to be financed through foreign </p><p>grants ($94 million), foreign borrowing ($260 million), domestic </p><p>financing ($906 million) and privatization receipts ($145 </p><p>million).  In the medium term, the government hopes to further </p><p>improve the fiscal situation by reducing the budget deficit to </p><p>5.6% of GDP by 2005. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Revenue to rise 16%; exemptions withdrawn </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Revenue is forecast to increase by 16% in 2003 - a </p><p>reasonable target given the projected GDP growth of 5.5%, </p><p>inflation of 9% and a new, broad-based tax regime.  The Value </p><p>Added Tax (VAT) introduced in August 2002 and import tariffs </p><p>were expanded to cover exempted goods and sectors. A 20% import </p><p>surcharge will remain through 2003, while a 0.1% debit tax on </p><p>bank transactions was extended to all types of bank accounts. </p><p>Certain other tax exemptions were withdrawn.  The government </p><p>expects additional revenue of about Rs 12 billion from the </p><p>expanded tax regime.  Furthermore, new taxes on annual vehicle </p><p>license fees, airline tickets and tourist hotels will fund the </p><p>development of roads, airports and tourism.  Some of these taxes </p><p>have drawn criticism from affected persons and industries. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The budget announced the establishment of a revenue </p><p>authority to coordinate the functions of the various revenue </p><p>collecting agencies.  In addition, tax administration is to </p><p>become more transparent and simplified.  In order to widen the </p><p>tax net, the government offered an amnesty to defaulters and non- </p><p>taxpayers, with the intention of bringing them under a new tax </p><p>regime from April 2003. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Expenditure to come under control </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  On the expenditure front, GSL expects a contraction </p><p>equivalent to about 1.1% of GDP in 2003.  Significantly, all of </p><p>this will arise from cuts in recurrent expenditure.  Public </p><p>investment will rise from 4.6% of GDP in 2002 to 5.3% of GDP or </p><p>Rs 95 billion ($980 million), but will remain below the 6-7% of </p><p>GDP spent in 1998-2000 and below levels required for stronger </p><p>economic growth.  Specific expenditure control measures in the </p><p>budget included strict budgetary controls, controls over defense </p><p>expenditure, public administration reforms and interest savings </p><p>on public debt.  Otherwise the Government has little room for </p><p>expenditure management, especially with debt servicing running </p><p>ahead of total revenues.  Interest payments will absorb 31% of </p><p>government expenditure (excluding repayments), public investment </p><p>(21%), defense (14%), welfare (5%), pensions (8%) and central </p><p>government salaries (6%).  While defense expenditure has been </p><p>reduced by about 0.5% of GDP, it still remains one of the </p><p>largest spending items.  Total defense spending (including </p><p>Police) is projected at Rs 63 billion (3.5% of GDP) in 2003 </p><p>compared with 4% of GDP in 2002, 3.8% in 2001 and 5.7% in 2000. </p><p>Significantly, the budget did not contain any of the populist </p><p>measures typical of recent GSL budgets. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Public Debt </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Due to heavy past borrowing to fund the war and unproductive </p><p>programs, Sri Lanka\'s public debt has increased to 105% of GDP, </p><p>prompting the government to accord high priority to bringing </p><p>debt under control.  Debt servicing at Rs 326 billion (approx </p><p>$3.36 billion) is the largest expenditure item in the budget and </p><p>compares to total revenues of Rs 304 billion in 2003.  The main </p><p>feature of the new debt management policy is to reduce short- </p><p>term debt instruments by replacing them with long-term bonds at </p><p>lower interest rates.  A huge government overdraft from the </p><p>banking sector is also being eliminated.  In addition, an </p><p>independent debt management office will be established in early </p><p>2003.  These efforts, together with lower deficits, are expected </p><p>to gradually reduce public debt to 91.1% of GDP by end 2005. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Reforms to continue </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The budget speech reiterated the government\'s commitment to </p><p>economic reforms covering a litany of areas - from welfare, </p><p>pensions and public administration to labor, land, power and </p><p>privatization.  In addition, subsidies on a range of items from </p><p>wheat to petroleum and electricity have been already reduced. </p><p>The privatization program hopes to earn Rs 14 billion ($146 </p><p>million) in 2003 through the sale of remaining Sri Lanka Telecom </p><p>shares and the opening of petroleum imports to the private </p><p>sector.  In 2002, the government sold two sugar companies, a </p><p>bunkering company and minority stakes in 6 bus companies.  The </p><p>sale of Sri Lanka Insurance corporation and a 15% stake in Sri </p><p>Lanka Telecom are underway.  Total receipts are expected at Rs </p><p>21 billion ($219 million) in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Private sector </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Finance Minister stressed the importance of stimulating </p><p>growth and investment and increasing employment opportunities </p><p>outside the armed forces.  The government hopes that the </p><p>combination of a recovering economy and a decline in public </p><p>sector borrowing from domestic banks will reduce inflation and </p><p>interest rates, spurring private sector activity.  To boost </p><p>investment, the top corporate tax band was reduced from 35% to </p><p>30%, with half of the tax savings going into a skills </p><p>development fund.  In addition, tax holidays were slightly </p><p>increased from 3 years to 5 years for exporting companies </p><p>located outside Colombo.  The maximum tax holiday for large </p><p>infrastructure projects was also increased from 10 to 12 years. </p><p>Furthermore, joint public-private sector apex councils will </p><p>boost the tourism, garments, plantation, agribusiness, fishing </p><p>and jewelry industries. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The budget proposed mandatory credit ratings for financial </p><p>institutions and corporate debt instruments.  Exchange control </p><p>liberalization will allow foreign companies to access rupee </p><p>credit facilities.  Various other foreign exchange </p><p>liberalization measures will facilitate trade and investment: </p><p>import credit facilities up to 360 days, currency conversions to </p><p>settle loans, forward facilities up to 720 days and foreign </p><p>investment in debentures and government bonds. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>North East rehabilitation not covered </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  The budget did not cover the rehabilitation of the north </p><p>and east devastated by war.  The Government hopes to receive aid </p><p>from development partners for these activities at special donor </p><p>meetings, the first of which took place in Oslo on November 25. </p><p>A meeting in Tokyo in 2003 is to deal with medium term </p><p>assistance for the countrywide programs in the budget. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Private sector welcomes the budget; opposition critical </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Private sector analysts and the business community have </p><p>praised the budget for its commitment to fiscal discipline and </p><p>reforms.  But they have also pressed for practical measures to </p><p>implement new proposals and ensure accountability.  Tax experts </p><p>and businessmen also commended tax administration proposals </p><p>aimed at simplifying the system.  But they worry that expanded </p><p>taxation will lead to inflation and affect export </p><p>competitiveness.  One of the most controversial has been the </p><p>extension of the VAT to the banking system, which analysts fear </p><p>could lead to increased interest costs.  Another proposal to </p><p>charge a 15% tax on inward remittances was withdrawn due to </p><p>adverse effects on remittances of unskilled Sri Lankan workers </p><p>in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The opposition has criticized the budget for a lack of </p><p>relief for the working class and poor, as well as for not </p><p>funding major development projects.  Some opposition politicians </p><p>have accused the government of simply following the dictates of </p><p>the World Bank and the IMF.  Key government ministers defended </p><p>the budget moves, saying the country would incur more debt if </p><p>the people were to be given further economic relief.  The stock </p><p>market reacted negatively to the budget especially due to </p><p>increased taxation on the key banking sector, which accounts for </p><p>44% of Colombo market capitalization.  The budget was passed in </p><p>Parliament on November 14 with 129 votes for and 93 against. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  This is the UNF\'s first full-year budget, its 2002 budget </p><p>having been delayed by elections until three months into this </p><p>year.  It is a credible first step toward reversing the slide in </p><p>fiscal discipline that Sri Lanka has suffered in recent years. </p><p>But with a deficit target of 7.5% of GDP, the budget is neither </p><p>ambitious nor far-reaching in its reforms.  This is no surprise </p><p>from a government that is pursuing a delicate peace process and </p><p>faces elections any time at the will of the President.  Still, </p><p>if GSL sticks to this budget - or even comes close - it will be </p><p>well on its way to its modest medium-term goal of fiscal </p><p>stability in 2005. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
