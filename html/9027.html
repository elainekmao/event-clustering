<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004121 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EUR/PGI, OES/PCI </p><p>PLEASE PASS EPA (BFREEMAN, HHUYNH) </p><p>ALSO FOR USAID/EE/EEST (CMITCHELL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, TBIO, PGOV, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE: RECENT IMPROVEMENTS </p><p>AMID PERSISTENT NEED FOR RESOURCES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. ANKARA 611 </p><p>B. 02 ANKARA 7205 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Turkey\'s wastewater resources infrastructure </p><p>serves its metropolitan populations sufficiently but is </p><p>unable to provide adequate sanitation services in rural </p><p>areas.  Most wastewater is disposed of untreated in bodies </p><p>of water.  Although the number of wastewater treatment </p><p>facilities in Turkey doubled in the 1990s, resources have </p><p>been reduced over the past two decades and now severely </p><p>limit construction of new facilities.  The huge price tag </p><p>that comes with infrastructure is likely to make this a </p><p>troublesome chapter in Turkey\'s EU aspirations. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Untreated wastewater is one of the most costly </p><p>infrastructure elements necessary to protect human health </p><p>from bacteria and viruses, tourist beaches from </p><p>contamination, ecosystems from destruction, and fisheries as </p><p>productive economic options.  Turkey\'s wastewater treatment </p><p>standards are consistent with those of the EU and World Bank </p><p>for physical, chemical and biological parameters but outside </p><p>of major cities, resources allotted to municipalities to </p><p>meet those high standards fall short.  The numbers are not </p><p>encouraging: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Only 17 percent of Turkey\'s population is served by a </p><p>public wastewater treatment system.  In the U.S., 71 percent </p><p>are served.  The OECD average is 59 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- About 70 percent of wastewater is discharged without </p><p>treatment into rivers.  About a quarter of municipalities </p><p>also rely on unsanitary seepage pits for domestic wastewater </p><p>disposal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Many municipal wastewater treatment plants are not </p><p>operational due to high operating costs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MOST POLLUTION COMES FROM AGRICULTURE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The greatest source of wastewater in Turkey is </p><p>agriculture, followed by domestic and industrial uses. </p><p>Turkey\'s most severe agricultural nutrient discharge pours </p><p>into the Black Sea from the Kizilirmak, Yesilirmak and </p><p>Sakarya rivers in Central Anatolia.  Agricultural wastewater </p><p>is so severe from these rivers that the Global Environmental </p><p>Facility (GEF) issued a $12 million grant earlier this year </p><p>to improve agricultural practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Industries produce only one percent of Turkey\'s </p><p>wastewater, according to the State Institute of Statistics </p><p>(SIS).  However, industrial wastewater is the most toxic, </p><p>pouring chemicals such as lead, mercury, chromium, and zinc </p><p>into the effluent.  Only about ten percent of Turkey\'s </p><p>industrial zones have wastewater treatment facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MUNICIPALITIES SEEK FUNDING </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Turkey would need about $4 billion dollars to meet its </p><p>sewage infrastructure needs and another $1.5 billion for </p><p>wastewater treatment plants, based on Iller Bank numbers. </p><p>The Bank of Provinces (Iller Bank), under the Ministry of </p><p>Public Works, issues grants and credit for environmental </p><p>infrastructure using GOT resources to cover a large portion </p><p>of municipal wastewater needs.  Municipalities, however, are </p><p>responsible for providing infrastructure in their </p><p>communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Over the past two decades, economic crises and new </p><p>priorities forced the GOT to reduce its financial </p><p>contribution to Iller Bank\'s infrastructure projects.  GOT </p><p>now covers only six (6) percent of project costs, </p><p>dramatically down from 80 percent. Iller\'s tillers decrease </p><p>further as many small municipalities do not re-pay their </p><p>loans.  The Bank\'s resources grew so low that at the end of </p><p>2002, Iller could not fund tender-ready plans for 270 sewer </p><p>systems, wastewater treatment plants and sea-outfalls. </p><p>Several greater municipalities found support for their </p><p>projects from international sources, but of 2,300 needed </p><p>projects, 1,500 remain unfunded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU RELEVANCE </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Wastewater infrastructure increased in relevance when </p><p>Turkey joined the European Customs Union Agreement in 1995 </p><p>as it will again during EU accession discussions.  Their </p><p>high price tags have made the environmental components of </p><p>the EU acquis among the most difficult for candidate </p><p>countries.  As part of Turkey\'s pre-accession strategy, the </p><p>EU has provided funds to identify potential gaps between EU </p><p>and Turkish legislation, but those funds do not cover </p><p>infrastructure needs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMPROVEMENT IN THE CITIES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Most wastewater infrastructure is concentrated in </p><p>heavily populated areas with evident improvement over the </p><p>past decade.  SIS estimates that from 1994-98, the </p><p>percentage of treated wastewater tripled to nearly 30 </p><p>percent.  The number of wastewater treatment plants doubled </p><p>from 41 to 81 and the population served by sewer systems </p><p>increased to 60 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Major cities have recently invested significantly and </p><p>effectively in wastewater infrastructure.  Ankara </p><p>constructed a $170-million wastewater treatment plant in </p><p>1997 and opened new sewer system that serves 98 percent of </p><p>its population.  A series of projects in Istanbul has ended </p><p>direct wastewater discharge into the Golden Horm (Halic) and </p><p>visibly cleaned that central body of water.  Izmir\'s self- </p><p>funded, comprehensive $80-million "Dream Channel Project" </p><p>begun in 1999 has won broad public acclaim for effectively </p><p>cleaning up Izmir Gulf. The Mediterranean tourist center of </p><p>Antalya treats and discharges all wastewater at-sea and </p><p>requires all treatment centers to maintain laboratories for </p><p>continual testing of effluent and water supply. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Even in the rural Southeast, Diyarbakir, with 30 percent </p><p>of the region\'s population, has received funding from German </p><p>banks and will open a new wastewater treatment plant later </p><p>this year.  However, smaller communities in the region and </p><p>throughout rural Turkey do not receive adequate financial </p><p>support and are unable to provide sufficient wastewater </p><p>infrastructure for their residents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Comment.  The need for strengthening wastewater </p><p>infrastructure may make Turkey\'s municipalities and </p><p>industrial plants coveted customers of companies selling </p><p>pollution control equipment.  However, financing will remain </p><p>a significant burden until sanitation infrastructure places </p><p>higher among many competing priorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
