<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001021 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR FOR WHA/CA </p><p>BERN PASS ZURICH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, EAID, PREF, YI, CA, CIDA, AID </p><p>SUBJECT: DONOR SUPPORT FOR KOSOVO, ESPECIALLY RETURNS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 83100 </p><p> </p><p>1. Canada\'s International Development Agency (CIDA) confirmed </p><p>April 9 that Canada has committed C$5.4 million to Kosovo for </p><p>calendar year 2003.  (The Canadian dollar is worth about 68 </p><p>US cents.)  They do not, at this point, specifically support </p><p>the Office of Returns and Communities, but will provide funds </p><p>on an ad hoc basis when the security situation improves. </p><p>Canada does, however, provide about C$1.1 million to a local </p><p>initiative program managed from Pristina that can be used for </p><p>ORC. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CIDA is consulting with UNMIK, but says nothing is </p><p>happening on the ground.  Once it is feasible, Canada does </p><p>intend to provide additional funds to support ORC.  Post </p><p>believes CIDA would welcome any evidence Washington can </p><p>provide that the time is ripe for effective use of </p><p>contributions to ORC. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
