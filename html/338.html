<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOSCOW 04292 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, UR </p><p>SUBJECT:  RADICAL POLITICAL REFORM ON TAP AT CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WE ASSUME ADDRESSEES HAVE SEEN THE FBIS TEXT OF </p><p>GORBACHEV\'S MEETING WITH MINERS AT THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE FEBRUARY 2.  THE TEXT WAS CARRIED IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL PRESS FEBRUARY 5.  EMBASSY PRELIMINARY </p><p>ANALYSIS FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  A SEEMINGLY CONFIDENT GORBACHEV TOLD THE MINERS </p><p>THAT THE PLENUM WOULD ADOPT A SET OF RADICAL </p><p>POLITICAL REFORMS, HINTING THAT APPROVAL OF A </p><p>MULTIPARTY SYSTEM AND DRASTIC REVISION, PERHAPS </p><p>REPEAL, OF ARTICLE SIX OF THE USSR CONSTITUTION (ON </p><p>THE PARTY\'S PRIMACY) WERE IN THE OFFING.  ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>ARGUED THAT THE POSTS OF PARTY AND STATE LEADER </p><p>SHOULD BE COMBINED DURING THE "TRANSITION PERIOD," HE </p><p>SAID HE SUPPORTED THEIR ULTIMATE SEPARATION.  THE </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS WOULD DECIDE THE ISSUE, HE NOTED.  HE </p><p>CALLED FOR DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS TO THE 28TH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, PREDICTING THE PLENUM WOULD APPROVE AN </p><p>EXCEPTION TO EXISTING PARTY RULES TO PERMIT THAT. </p><p>GORBACHEV, HOWEVER, WAS SILENT ON WHETHER THE </p><p>CONGRESS WOULD BE ADVANCED TO THIS SPRING, AS MANY </p><p>PARTY MEMBERS HAVE DEMANDED, BUT NOTED THAT THE </p><p>CONGRESS WAS NECESSARY TO "RENEW" BOTH THE POLITBURO </p><p>AND THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AFTER A WEEK IN WHICH THE CENTRAL PRESS WAS </p><p>FILLED WITH ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS OF INTELLECTUALS </p><p>CALLING FOR ENHANCING THE POWER OF THE CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>THE SUPREME SOVIET (I.E., GORBACHEV), THE MEETING </p><p>WITH MINERS WAS CLEARLY INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>GORBACHEV HAS SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FROM THE WORKING </p><p>CLASS AS WELL.  AT THE MEETING, GORBACHEV EXTENDED AN </p><p>INVITATION TO THE MINERS TO SEND A TEN-MAN DELEGATION </p><p>TO THE PLENUM ITSELF AND SUGGESTED ITS MEMBERS MIGHT </p><p>BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK.  THAT TOO WAS AN OBVIOUS PLOY TO </p><p>WIN FAVOR WITH WORKERS AND TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION </p><p>THAT THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE HEARD AT THE </p><p>PLENUM.  OVERALL, MEDIA REPORTING OF THE PAST WEEK </p><p>AND THE HUGE DEMONSTRATION IN MOSCOW IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>RADICAL POLITICAL REFORM FEBRUARY 4 (REPORTED SEPTEL) </p><p>HAVE CREATED THAT IMPRESSION THAT GORBACHEV IS IN </p><p>CHARGE AND PREPARED TO PUSH THROUGH A SET OF RADICAL </p><p>PARTY REFORMS THAT WOULD HAVE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE JUST </p><p>A FEW MONTHS AGO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LAST RUMORS </p><p>/---------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO A DEPARTMENT HEAD AT THE INSTITUTE </p><p>OF STATE AND LAW (STRICTLY PROTECT), TWO KEY ITEMS ON </p><p>THE PLENUM AGENDA WILL BE THE TIMING OF THE 28TH </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS AND THE METHOD OF SELECTING DELEGATES </p><p>TO IT.  OUR SOURCE SAID THE PLENUM WOULD DECIDE TO </p><p>ADVANCE THE DATE OF THE CONGRESS FROM OCTOBER TO </p><p>PERHAPS AS EARLY AS APRIL OR MAY.  HE BELIEVED THE </p><p>PLENUM WOULD APPROVE DIRECT SELECTION OF DELEGATES BY </p><p>THE PARTY RANK AND FILE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ACCORDING TO A BRITISH DIPLOMAT CITING A </p><p>CONVERSATION LATE LAST WEEK WITH ARKADIY VAKSBERG </p><p>(PROTECT), A POLITICAL COMMENTATOR FOR "LITERATURNAYA </p><p>GAZETA," LIGACHEV AND VOROTNIKOV WILL RETIRE AT THE </p><p>PLENUM AND CENTRAL COMMITTEE SECRETARY MANAYENKOV </p><p>WILL BE ELEVATED TO THE POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>6.  LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>MATLOCK </p><p></p></div>
