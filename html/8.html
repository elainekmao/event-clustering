<p>S E C R E T TEHRAN 8233 </p><p> </p><p>Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 30 JUN 2005 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 11652: GDS </p><p>TAGS: PINT, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: SHAH ON CORRUPTION </p><p> </p><p>1. AFTER AMBASSADOR BYROADE\'S AUDIENCE WITH SHAH WAS </p><p>FINISHED, I ASKED TO STAY BEHIND TO DISCUSS WITH SHAH </p><p>APPROACH OF SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO SWEDISH AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>OTHERS ABOUT ALLEGED INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OPPOSITION TO </p><p>GOI AS RESULT SHAH\'S RECENT DECREES ON CORRUPTION AND ON </p><p>NEW REQUIREMENT THAT GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND IMMEDIATE </p><p>SUBORDINATES DIVEST THEMSELVES OF ANY SHARES THEY HOLD IN </p><p>ANY COMPANIES OR INDUSTRIES. SHAH WAS OBVIOUSLY STARTLED </p><p>TO LEARN THAT SOVIETS WERE CLAIMING TO NOTE INCREASED </p><p>OPPOSITION AND ASKED RHETORICALLY HOW ANYONE COULD IMAGINE </p><p>SUCH A THING. WE AGREED THAT THIS WAS SOVIET PSYCHOLOGICAL </p><p>WARFARE DESIGNED TO UNSETTLE THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>THE SHAH IMMEDIATELY TIED IT IN TO THE RECENT </p><p>TUDEH PARTY/IRAQI COMMUNIST PROCLAMATION CRITICIZING GOI </p><p>ACTIVITIES. SHAH IS CONVINCED THAT SOVIETS ARE ATTEMPTING </p><p>TO RECREATE TUDEH PARTY AND PUT MONEY INTO STRENGTHENING </p><p>OF IRANIAN COMMUNIST MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. BEING PENSIVE FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT WE HAD BEEN </p><p>DISCUSSING, THE SHAH SAID, "PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN TOO TOUGH </p><p>ON CORRUPTION." TO WHICH I IMMEDIATELY REPLIED, "NO, SIR, </p><p>YOU CANNOT BE TOO TOUGH ON CORRUPTION." THERE THEN ENSUED </p><p>A DISCUSSION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN IRAN IN THE YEARS AHEAD </p><p>IF CORRUPTION IS NOT STEMMED WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS </p><p>FLOATING AROUND IN THE ECONOMY. IT WAS QUITE CLEAR FROM </p><p>THIS DISCUSSION THAT THE SHAH INDEED IS CONVINCED THAT HIS </p><p>PROGRAM AND THE COUNTRY\'S FUTURE WILL GO RIGHT DOWNHILL </p><p>IF HE IS NOT ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CORRUPTION ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>3. WHEN THE SHAH MENTIONED HIS INSISTENCE THAT CERTAIN </p><p>HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DIVEST THEMSELVES OF STOCKS </p><p>AND HOLDINGS, I SAID, "WON\'T MANY OF THEM HAVE TO UNLOAD?" </p><p>THE SHAH REPLIED, "A FEW, NOT ALL." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HELMHD </p><p></p></div>
