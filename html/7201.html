This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 7, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Milliyet/Bolge/Cumhuriyet: Two Patriot </p><p>missile batteries and military vehicles, </p><p>including Hummer jeeps, were unloaded at </p><p>Iskenderun port and moved to yesterday. It is not </p><p>definite yet where the Patriot missiles will be </p><p>deployed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Tercuman/Cumhuriyet: The US troops deployed </p><p>at two factories in Mardin\'s Organized Industrial </p><p>Zone have now evacuated the factories. The US </p><p>troops left the region in 11 buses and a convoy </p><p>of over 150 trucks yesterday. The military jeeps, </p><p>vehicles, equipment, and communications gear </p><p>leaving Mardin was heading for Iskenderun port. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Sabah/Milli Gazete/Turkiye/Cumhuriyet: </p><p>Incirlik Air Force Base, which had been quiet for </p><p>some time, experienced a very active day </p><p>yesterday. Around 100 trucks carrying military </p><p>equipment and generators, including Hummer jeeps, </p><p>entered the base yesterday evening. Twelve F-16 </p><p>fighters  and six F-15 fighters took off from the </p><p>base for an unknown destination early in the </p><p>morning, after which bombers, one passenger </p><p>aircraft, one tanker plane, and one hospital </p><p>plane also took off from the base. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Evrensel/Turkiye: As a result of the </p><p>explosion of a land mine the previous night in </p><p>Esenyamac village of Baskale (Van) right on the </p><p>Turkish-Iranian border, two villagers were </p><p>killed. It is reported that the land mine victims </p><p>were engaged in fuel-smuggling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Milliyet: PKK/KADEK, which declared a </p><p>unilateral cease fire  after its leader Abdullah </p><p>Ocalan was arrested in 1999, and had pulled the </p><p>majority of its militants into camps in northern </p><p>Iraq, has been using the war situation for its </p><p>propaganda in a region populated by the </p><p>international press. A Reuters reporter visiting </p><p>a PKK camp yesterday transmitted photographs of </p><p>female militants, and heard PKK demands for </p><p>political and cultural rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Evrensel: Although the Turkish Supreme Court </p><p>had lifted the ban on naming children in Kurdish, </p><p>the Court of First Instance in Ayvalik </p><p>(Balikesir) did not honor it. A resident in </p><p>Ayvalik, Abdullah Aric, wanted to name his son </p><p>(b. May 10, 2002) as "Rojhat."  The name means </p><p>"New Day" in Kurdish.  When he applied on May 13, </p><p>2002 to the Population Registry Office in Ayvalik </p><p>his request was refused. After struggling for </p><p>three months, the father managed to have his son </p><p>registered as "Rojhat." In the meantime, the </p><p>Population Registry Office sued the father on the </p><p>grounds that the name "Rojhat" was "not in </p><p>conformity with Turkish names and traditions." </p><p>The suit sought that the baby\'s name should be </p><p>annulled, per article 16/4 of the Population Law, </p><p>which mandates that "names that hurt public </p><p>opinion and are not in compliance with national </p><p>culture, moral values and regulations cannot be </p><p>given." The court decided to erase the name </p><p>"Rojhat" from the registry on March 27, 2003. </p><p>8.  Bolge: Around 300 members of Anti-War </p><p>Platform of Adana undertook an anti-war </p><p>demonstration at the entrance of Incirlik town </p><p>where the military airbase is located. The </p><p>demonstrators shouting anti-US and anti-AKP </p><p>slogans set fire to an effigy of President Bush </p><p>and smashed light bulbs that had been dipped in </p><p>blood. Jandarma took stringent security measures </p><p>and restricted the protesters\' activities to a </p><p>nearby vacant lot. The demonstrators carried </p><p>banners with slogans such as "Close Incirlik </p><p>Airbase," "Murderer USA, Collaborator AKP," "No </p><p>to imperialist occupation," "Don\'t be silent; </p><p>scream and stop the War," "Do not barricade </p><p>people, but rather the USA," and "AKP\'s bulb is </p><p>dipped in blood." </p><p>9.  Turkiye: In Hakkari, where there is a </p><p>shortage of doctors, inhabitants are taking their </p><p>patients to other provinces for treatment. </p><p>Hakkari Governor, Erdogan Gurbuz, he could not </p><p>understand why doctors did not come Hakkari to </p><p>work. Governor Gurbuz announced that he and the </p><p>security force members were serving in the region </p><p>happily, that there were no security problems, </p><p>and that he could provide fully equipped lodging </p><p>facilities for 500 doctors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Dunya: The President of Chamber of Industry </p><p>of Gaziantep, Nejat Kocer, said investment has </p><p>halted in many regions, but that Gaziantep city </p><p>deserved praise for its creating new job and </p><p>investment opportunities. Kocer added that banks </p><p>had reduced their loan capacities because of the </p><p>economic crisis continuing for two years now, </p><p>causing some Gaziantep companies to resort to </p><p>importing raw material, machinery, and spare </p><p>parts with loans obtained abroad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Evrensel: Van Province\'s Drivers and </p><p>Automobile Owners Association President, Sefik </p><p>Alpaslan, claimed that the Turkish Ministry of </p><p>Industry and Commerce\'s decision to not include </p><p>diesel in the list of items within the framework </p><p>of border trade would cause 120,000 people to </p><p>face starvation. Aplaslan said 2,720 trucks in </p><p>Van would become idle due to the decision by the </p><p>ministry, and estimated that an annual figure of </p><p>USD 4 million was generated from the diesel trade </p><p>between 1987 and 2000. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
