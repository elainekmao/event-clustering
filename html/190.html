<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 01097 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, PGOV, IZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  KURDISH INSURGENCY IN IRAQ AND TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  TRAINING CAMPS FOR PKK IN IRAN ARE A </p><p>GROWING WORRY FOR TURKEY AND, ACCORDING TO TURKISH </p><p>AMBASSADOR, HAVE BEEN A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION IN RECENT </p><p>IRANIAN-TURKISH MEETINGS.  BARZANI\'S KDP, APPARENTLY </p><p>IN SOME DISARRAY, HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO REIN IN THE </p><p>PKK, WHICH HAS ACTIVELY BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH </p><p>TALABANI\'S PUK.  THE TURKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>POSSIBLE DELIVERY OF WEAPONS TO PKK BY THE IRAQIS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ACCORDING TO TURKISH AMBASSADOR KOKSAL, ONE OF </p><p>THE TOP  ITEMS ON THE AGENDA DURING THE IRANIAN </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERIOR\'S RECENT VISIT TO ANKARA WAS </p><p>IRANIAN SUPPORT OF THE PKK INSURGENTS BY PROVIDING </p><p>THEM TRAINING CAMPS IN IRAN AND BY ASSISTING THEM </p><p>IN THEIR IRAQI SANCTUARIES.  (ANOTHER TOP PRIORITY, </p><p>KOKSAL SAID, WAS THE PROBLEM OF THE LARGE IRANIAN </p><p>REFUGEE POPULATION.)  IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR THE PKK </p><p>IS A DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS ONLY BEEN NOTICED OVER </p><p>THE PAST YEAR, AS THE IRANIAN EMPHASIS PREVIOUSLY </p><p>WAS IN SUPPORTING FUNDAMENTALIST POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>IN TURKEY.  THESE NEVER GARNERED SUFFICIENT POPULAR </p><p>ENTHUSIASM, SO THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO BE TRYING A NEW </p><p>TACTIC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  KOKSAL SAID THAT, DESPITE ASSURANCES TO TURKEY </p><p>THAT IT WOULD NOT GIVE ANY AID TO THE PKK, ELEMENTS </p><p>OF MASOUD BARZANI\'S KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF IRAQ </p><p>HAVE BEEN AIDING THE PKK, EVEN AS OTHERS OF ITS </p><p>ELEMENTS ARE BEING ATTACKED BY THE PKK.  KOKSAL </p><p>ATTRIBUTED THE PROBLEM TO MASOUD\'S POOR CONTROL </p><p>OVER HIS DISORGANIZED FORCES.  IN A SEPARATE CON- </p><p>VERSATION, TURKISH DCM OKCUN OBSERVED THAT THE </p><p>KDP HAS "FALLEN INTO SOME DISARRAY" FOLLOWING IDRIS </p><p>BARZANI\'S DEATH ONE YEAR AGO.  MASOUD HAD APPARENTLY </p><p>EVEN GIVEN THE ORDER TO KILL PKK INSURGENTS, </p><p>IN CONFORMITY WITH HIS "UNDERSTANDING" WITH A </p><p>TURKISH GENERAL IN COMMAND IN EASTERN TURKEY TO </p><p>"SHUT OUT" THE PKK, BUT MASOUD "CANNOT DISCIPLINE HIS </p><p>OWN PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  OKCUN SAID THAT APO ACALAN (HEAD OF PKK, </p><p>RESIDENT IN SYRIA) HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH JALAL </p><p>TALABANI, HEAD OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION OF KURDISTAN </p><p>(PUK), PRESUMABLY THROUGH SOME SYRIAN INTERMEDIATION </p><p>AND IMPETUS.  TALABANI IS SEEKING GREATER STATUS AS </p><p>"THE PREEMINENT KURDISH LEADER" AND THUS WANTS THE </p><p>PKK AS AN ALLY, BUT ONLY IF THE PKK BEHAVES ITSELF. </p><p>ACCORDING TO OKCUN, TALABANI ALSO IS LOOKING TOWARD </p><p>A TIME WHEN THE PKK WILL BE HELPFUL TO HIM IN MOVING </p><p>AGAINST BARZANI.  THE ELEMENTS OF THE TALABANI- </p><p>ACALAN AGREEMENT SEEM TO BE: </p><p> </p><p>-- CESSATION, FOR THE TIME BEING, OF PKK ATTACKS </p><p>ON CIVILIANS, </p><p> </p><p>-- CESSATION OF PKK ASSASSINATIONS OF OTHER KURDS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE, </p><p> </p><p>-- TURNING AGAINST THE KDP IN FULL FORCE, BUT NOT </p><p>UNTIL "THE TIME IS RIPE." </p><p> </p><p>OKCUN OBSERVED THAT IT IS ODD THAT THE PKK IS CULTI- </p><p>VATING THE PUK, WHOSE TRADITIONAL AREA OF OPERATION </p><p>IS AROUND SULAYMANIYYA AND NOT ALONG THE IRAQI- </p><p>TURKISH BORDER WHICH IS KEY TO THE PKK, BUT HE ASSUMED </p><p>THAT THE          IMPORTANT FACTORS ARE ANGER AT </p><p>MASOUD\'S PRESSURE ON THE PKK AND MASOUD\'S INCREASING </p><p>LACK OF CONTROL WHICH ALLOWS THE PKK TO USE BASES IN </p><p>KDP TERRITORY DESPITE ENMITY WITH MASOUD.  OKCUN </p><p>SAID THAT IN THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THERE HAS BEEN A </p><p>MARKED DECREASE IN PKK ATTACKS, EVEN ON JANDARMA, AND </p><p>HE GAVE CREDIT TO THE PUTATIVE ACALAN-TALABANI- </p><p>SYRIAN AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  OKCUN ADDED THAT A NEW WORRISOME ELEMENT HAS EMERGED </p><p>IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS:  USE BY THE PKK OF NEW WEAPONRY </p><p>OBTAINED FROM THE IRAQIS.  THE TURKS, OKCUN SAID, HAVE </p><p>TO ASSUME THAT THESE WEAPONS HAVE NOT BEEN CAPTURED, SINCE </p><p>THEY ARE IN SERIAL SEQUENCE AND NEW.  THE TURKS HAVE NOT </p><p>RAISED THE ISSUE YET WITH THE IRAQIS, IN HOPES THAT IT </p><p>WILL TURN OUT TO HAVE  BEEN A LIMITED ARRANGEMENT. </p><p>(ASKED WHY THE IRAQIS WOULD RISK HARMING ITS KEY </p><p>RELATIONAHIP WITH TURKEY--AFTER ALL, NEITHER STATE IS </p><p>BLESSED WITH AN OVERABUNDANCE OF FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS-- </p><p>OKCUN MUSED THAT "ALL THESE COUNTRIES"--SYRIA, IRAN, </p><p>AND IRAQ--ARE ACCUSTOMED TO PUTTING ON PRESSURE THROUGH </p><p>RUNDERHANDED, VIOLENT MEANS:  "IT IS IN THEIR CHARACTER," </p><p>WAS HIS VIEW.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  THE HISTORY OF KURDS, AT LEAST IN IRAQI </p><p>KURDISTAN, IS THAT PPWE THEY ARE ALWAYS READY TO FIGHT </p><p>NON-KURDISH OUTSIDERS THEY ALSO FREQUENTLY FIGHT EACH </p><p>OTHER.  THE CURRENT PKK-KDP SITUATION AND FREQUENT </p><p>KDP-PUK FUEDS ILLUSTRATE THIS CONSTANT OF IRAQI KURDISH </p><p>POLITICS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p></p></div>
