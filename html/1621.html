IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE ZIMBABWE PARLIAMENT\'S RESETTLEMENT </p><p>COMMITTEE TABLED A REPORT IN FEBRUARY THAT CRITICIZED </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S "FAST-TRACK" LAND RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE </p><p>AS LACKING THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL.  THE </p><p>REPORT ALSO CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>PROGRAM "IN A TRANSPARENT MANNER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>LAWS OF THE COUNTRY."  ON MARCH 7, PARLIAMENT\'S LEGAL </p><p>COMMITTEE DECLARED ILLEGAL BROADCASTING REGULATIONS PUT </p><p>IN PLACE LAST YEAR TO SHUT DOWN PRIVATE RADIO BROADCASTS </p><p>(REFTEL).  PARLIAMENT\'S ZANU-PF MPS REJECTED THE LEGAL </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S FINDINGS SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND ON MARCH 22, </p><p>SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA BLOCKED DEBATE </p><p>ON THE COMMITTEE\'S REPORT, PUTTING THE RESTRICTIVE </p><p>REGULATIONS ON THE FAST-TRACK TO BECOMING LAW.  THE </p><p>DEFIANT ACTIONS OF TWO PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES </p><p>DOMINATED BY ZANU-PF INDICATED THAT THE RULING PARTY IS </p><p>STILL DIVIDED ON CRUCIAL ISSUES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) THE PARLIAMENT\'S PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON </p><p>RESETTLEMENT TABLED A REPORT IN FEBRUARY THAT CRITICIZED </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT FOR FAILING TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES </p><p>TO RESETTLED FARMERS.  AFTER VISITING FARMS IN THE </p><p>MASHONALAND PROVINCES, THE COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT A </p><p>SHORTAGE OF STAFF, TRANSPORT, FUEL, AND INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01209  01 OF 02  031200Z </p><p>IS HAMPERING THE GOVERNMENT\'S "FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT </p><p>EXERCISE, AND FARM OPERATIONS ON "INFORMALLY SETTLED" </p><p>FARMS HAD GROUND TO A HALT, ACCORDING TO A COPY OF THE </p><p>REPORT OBTAINED BY THE EMBASSY.  THE REPORT ALSO CALLED </p><p>UPON THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT ITS RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM IN A "TRANSPARENT MANNER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>LAWS OF THE COUNTRY," AND THAT ALL LAND REQUIRED FOR </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PURPOSES BE ACQUIRED USING THE "RELEVANT </p><p>LEGAL INSTRUMENTS."  THE COMMITTEE NOTED THAT THE POLICE </p><p>HAD DONE NOTHING TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER ON THE </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS, SOMETHING THAT IS "CAUSE FOR CONCERN IF </p><p>THE LAND REFORM PROGRAM IS TO BE SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>IMPLEMENTED." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ON MARCH 7, PARLIAMENT\'S LEGAL COMMITTEE </p><p>DECLARED ILLEGAL BROADCASTING REGULATIONS PUT IN PLACE </p><p>LAST OCTOBER TO SHUT DOWN PRIVATE RADIO BROADCASTS </p><p>(REFTEL).  USING THE PRESIDENTIAL POWERS (TEMPORARY </p><p>MEASURES) ACT, PRESIDENT MUGABE ISSUED A STATUTORY </p><p>INSTRUMENT OUTLINING STRINGENT LICENSING REGULATIONS </p><p>THAT MADE IT LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PRIVATE RADIO </p><p>STATIONS TO BROADCAST, EVEN THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT HAD </p><p>JUST RULED THE GOVERNMENT\'S BROADCAST MONOPOLY ILLEGAL. </p><p>PURPORTEDLY, INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO, WHO </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE A LEGAL BACKGROUND, HASTILY DREW UP THE </p><p>REGULATIONS FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S ISSUANCE.  REGULATIONS </p><p>ISSUED UNDER THE TEMPORARY MEASURES ACT EXPIRE IN SIX </p><p>MONTHS UNLESS THEY ARE PASSED INTO LAW BY PARLIAMENT. </p><p>THE BROADCASTING REGULATIONS WILL EXPIRE BEFORE THE END </p><p>OF APRIL.  THE THREE-MEMBER LEGAL COMMITTEE--COMPRISED </p><p>OF MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE AND TWO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01209  01 OF 02  031200Z </p><p>DISGRUNTLED ZANU-PF MEMBERS, KUMBIRAI KANGAI AND EDDISON </p><p>ZVOBGO--WAS EXPECTED TO RUBBER-STAMP THE REGULATIONS. </p><p>INSTEAD, IT FOUND THEM UNCONSTITUTIONAL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) ZANU-PF PARLIAMENTARIANS, INCLUDING JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA, REJECTED THE COMMITTEE\'S </p><p>FINDINGS IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE, ACCORDING TO THE 16- </p><p>22 MARCH EDITION OF THE "ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT." </p><p>CHINAMASA ACCUSED THE COMMITTEE OF ALLOWING THE MDC TO </p><p>WRITE THE REPORT AND DEMANDED AN INVESTIGATION.  SPEAKER </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT MNANGAGWA STATED THAT HE WOULD LOOK INTO </p><p>THE ALLEGATIONS.  ON MARCH 22, MNANGAGWA THREW OUT THE </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S REPORT, STATING THAT HIS INVESTIGATIONS </p><p>FOUND THE COMMITTEE TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION AND PARLIAMENT\'S STANDING ORDERS, AND THAT </p><p>IT HAD NOT BEEN SUBMITTED ON TIME.  THE SPEAKER ORDERED </p><p>THE REPORT DISCHARGED FROM THE PARLIAMENTARY AGENDA, </p><p>EFFECTIVELY QUASHING ANY DEBATE ON THE ISSUE.  THE </p><p>REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN INTO THE BROADCASTING </p><p>BILL, WHICH, ONCE PASSED, WILL MAKE THE STRINGENT </p><p>LICENSING REQUIREMENTS INTO LAW. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: THE DEFIANT REPORTS OF TWO ZANU-PF- </p><p>DOMINATED PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES INDICATE THAT ZANU-PF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5273 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01209  02 OF 02  031200Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------DABF2E  031200Z /38 </p><p>P 031204Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8568 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001209 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AAA/AFR VDICKSON-HORTON, AFRISA CPALMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES DEFY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01209  02 OF 02  031200Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON LAND REFORM AND BROADCASTING REGULATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REMAINS DIVIDED ON MANY CRUCIAL ISSUES OF THE DAY. </p><p>THEIR FINDINGS, WHICH CLEARLY WENT AGAINST THE RULING </p><p>PARTY\'S PLANS ON LAND REFORM AND LIMITING PRESS FREEDOM, </p><p>DEMONSTRATE THAT NOT ALL ZANU-PF PARLIAMENTARIANS </p><p>BELIEVE IN THEIR LEADERS\' FLAWED, POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT </p><p>STRATEGIES.
