<p>S E C R E T BOGOTA 003994 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC KILLS TWO HIGH PROFILE HOSTAGES </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. ANNE W. PATTERSON FOR REASONS 1.5(B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) ON MAY 5, THE FARC EXECUTED TWO HIGH PROFILE HOSTAGES- </p><p>ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR GUILLERMO GAVIRIA AND FORMER DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER AND PEACE ADVISER GILBERTO ECHEVERRI- IN AN AREA </p><p>NEAR URRAO, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT.  EIGHT SOLDIERS WHO THE </p><p>FARC ALSO HAD KIDNAPPED WERE KILLED AS WELL.  SOURCES </p><p>INDICATE THAT THE MURDERS TOOK PLACE DURING AN ILL-FATED </p><p>RESCUE ATTEMPT BY A COLOMBIAN SPECIAL FORCES UNIT. THE FARC </p><p>DISCOVERED THE ATTEMPTED RESCUE AND A FIREFIGHT ENSUED. </p><p>DURING THIS ENCOUNTER, THE FARC ALLEGEDLY EXECUTED THE </p><p>PRISONERS WITH SHOTS TO THE HEAD. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) THE FARC RELEASED A STATEMENT THAT CONFIRMED THE </p><p>DEATHS OF GAVIRIA AND ECHEVERRI, ALONG WITH THE MILITARY </p><p>HOSTAGES, AND ATTRIBUTED THE FATALITIES TO A FAILED RESCUE </p><p>ATTEMPT ORCHESTRATED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT.  GAVIRIA </p><p>AND ECHEVERRI HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY THE FARC ON APRIL 21, </p><p>2002 WHILE PARTICIPATING IN A PEACE MARCH IN CAICEDO, </p><p>ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) THE 41-YEAR-OLD GAVIRIA, SON OF A PROMINENT MEDELLIN </p><p>FAMILY THAT OWNED THE INFLUENTIAL EL MUNDO NEWSPAPER, ENTERED </p><p>OFFICE AS GOVERNOR OF ANTIOQUIA IN JANUARY, 2001. HE WAS THE </p><p>SOLE CANDIDATE OF THE LIBERAL PARTY DURING THAT CAMPAIGN. </p><p>PREVIOUSLY, HE HAD WORKED AS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>INSTITUTE OF ROADS OF COLOMBIA FROM 1994 UNTIL 1999.  HE </p><p>ATTENDED THE COLORADO SCHOOL OF MINES WHERE HE GRADUATED WITH </p><p>A DEGREE IN ENGINEERING AND MINING ADMINISTRATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE 69-YEAR-OLD ECHEVERRI, FORMER MINISTER OF DEFENSE </p><p>DURING THE SAMPER ADMINISTRATION, WORKED AS THE PEACE </p><p>COMMISSIONER FOR ANTIOQUIA.  THE MEDELLIN NATIVE HAD HELD THE </p><p>GOVERNORSHIP OF ANTIOQUIA FROM 1990-91.  FOLLOWING THIS, HE </p><p>REENTERED THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS PRESIDENT OF THE CELLULAR </p><p>TELEPHONE COMPANY, OCCEL. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  COMMENT:  THE ASSASSINATION OF GAVIRIA AND ECHEVERRI, </p><p>BOTH POPULAR POLITICIANS, BY THE FARC WILL STUN COLOMBIANS. </p><p>GAVIRIA AND ECHEVERRI WERE THE FARC\'S TWO MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>BARGAINING CHIPS WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN SECURING AN EXCHANGE </p><p>OF HOSTAGES FOR FARC PRISONERS.  WE EXPECT THAT URIBE WILL </p><p>ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOTCHED RESCUE ATTEMPT.  URIBE </p><p>WILL NOW FIND HIMSELF UNDER EVEN MORE INTENSE PRESSURE TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE A HOSTAGE EXCHANGE WITH THE FARC AND FOREGO FUTURE </p><p>RESCUE ATTEMPTS.  URIBE WILL RESIST THIS PRESSURE TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE A HOSTAGE EXCHANGE; HOWEVER, HE MAY SHY AWAY FROM </p><p>APPROVING ANY RESCUE EFFORTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  AS FOR THE </p><p>FARC, ITS TERRORIST INSTINCTS HAVE ONCE AGAIN FORFEITED ANY </p><p>SUCCESS AT GAINING SOME POSITIVE POLITICAL TRACTION ON THE </p><p>HOSTAGE ISSUE.  EMBASSY IS CERTAIN THAT WE CAN DETERMINE THE </p><p>EXACT FACTS OF THE RESCUE IN A FEW DAYS, AND WE WILL ADVISE </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
