REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE RESEARCH FELLOW BRIAN </p><p>RAFTOPOULOS TOLD CHARGE AND POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 1 THAT, IN PREPARATION FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION, ZANU-PF WILL EMPLOY INCREASED VIOLENCE AGAINST </p><p>THE OPPOSITION PARTY MOVEMENT FOR DQOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), </p><p>INDEPENDENT MEDIA, AND JUDICIARY, AND WILL WORK TO </p><p>NEUTRALIZE THE LABOR MOVEMENT AS A KEY SOURCE OF SUPPORT </p><p>AND ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY FOR THE MDC.  PRESIDENT MUGABE, </p><p>RAFTOPOULOS BELIEVES, WILL SECURE VICTORY IN 2002 BY ANY </p><p>MEANS NECESSARY, AND THE MDC MUST DECIDE NOW HOW IT WILL </p><p>RESPOND TO MUGABE\'S WINNING AN ILLEGITIMATE ELECTION.  FOR </p><p>ITS PART, THE MDC SHOULD FOCUS ON GETTING ITS SUPPORTERS </p><p>REGISTERED, ENSURING AN ACCURATE VOTERS\' ROLL, AND </p><p>MOBILIZING RURAL VOTERS, AS WELL AS CULTIVATING SUPPORT </p><p>WITHIN THE ARMY AND POLICE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES, ACCOMPANIED BY POLITICAL SECTION </p><p>CHIEF AND LABOFF, MET ON FEBRUARY 1 WITH BRIAN RAFTOPOULOS, </p><p>RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE\'S INSTITUTE </p><p>OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES AND AN ASTUTE OBSERVER OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>POLITICAL SCENE. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S STRATEGY FOR 2002 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00662  01 OF 02  071600Z </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO RAFTOPOULOS, ZANU-PF WILL EMPLOY A </p><p>MULTI-FACETED STRATEGY IN PREPARATION FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION IN 2002.  FIRST, HE SAID, THE MID-JANUARY </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTION IN BIKITA CONFIRMED THE RULING </p><p>PARTY\'S DETERMINATION TO USE A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION TO COW OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS AND </p><p>REVEALED ITS INTENTION TO USE TRADITIONAL LEADERS TO </p><p>MOBILIZE THE PARTY\'S SUPPORT BASE.  THE PARTY, HOWEVER, </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DEPLOY ITS SHOCK TROOPS OF </p><p>WAR VETERANS AND RENT-A-THUGS NATIONWIDE, AND WILL LIKELY </p><p>TARGET ITS CAMPAIGN MOST INTENSELY IN THE PROVINCES OF </p><p>MASHONALAND AND MASVINGO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE RESEARCH FELLOW SAID HE FULLY EXPECTS ZANU-PF </p><p>TO CONTINUE TO INTIMIDATE THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA AND TO </p><p>CREATE AS DIFFICULT AN OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM AS </p><p>POSSIBLE, LIKELY INVOLVING BOTH PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL </p><p>HARASSMENT.  HE POINTED TO THE JANUARY 28 BOMBING OF THE </p><p>PRINTING PLANT OF THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" AS THE </p><p>OPENING SHOT IN THIS COMPONENT OF THE CAMPAIGN.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, RAFTOPOULOS PREDICTED THAT ZANU-PF WOULD CONTINUE </p><p>TO PRESSURE THE CURRENT JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT INTO </p><p>LEAVING SO THAT THEY CAN BE REPLACED WITH MORE SYMPATHETIC </p><p>JURISTS.  (COMMENT: EMBOFFS SPOKE WITH RAFTOPOULOS THE DAY </p><p>BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE GUBBAY\'S FORCED </p><p>RESIGNATION, REPORTED REFTEL.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) RAFTOPOULOS SAID HE EXPECTS ZANU-PF WILL SHORTLY </p><p>TURN UP THE HEAT ON THE MDC\'S LEADERSHIP.  THE POLICE, HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00662  01 OF 02  071600Z </p><p>NOTED, CONTINUE TO HOLD OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PROSECUTING </p><p>MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI FOR HIS REMARKS IN OCTOBER </p><p>PREDICTING THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD BE REMOVED FROM </p><p>OFFICE VIOLENTLY BY AN ANGRY, FRUSTRATED POPULATION IF HE </p><p>DOES NOT DEPART OF HIS OWN ACCORD.  RAFTOPOULOS ANTICIPATED </p><p>THAT ZANU-PF LIKELY WOULD ALSO "GO AFTER" OTHER KEY </p><p>OPPOSITION OFFICIALS, INCLUDING YOUTH LEADERS.  (NOTE: </p><p>RAFTOPOULOS\'S PREDICTION PROVED PROPHETIC, AS THREE SENIOR </p><p>MDC LEADERS, INCLUDING THE OPPOSITION PARTY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>YOUTH DIRECTOR, WERE ARRESTED AND OR/BEATEN FOUR DAYS </p><p>LATER, ON FEBRUARY 5.  END NOTE.)  IN ADDITION, THE RULING </p><p>PARTY IS ACTIVELY SEEKING TO NEUTRALIZE THE LABOR MOVEMENT </p><p>AS A SOURCE OF SUPPORT AND ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY FOR THE </p><p>MDC (DETAILS OF THE CONVERSATION RELATED TO THE LABOR </p><p>MOVEMENT ARE REPORTED SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ASKED HIS PREDICTION OF THE LIKELIEST SCENARIO FOR </p><p>THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, RAFTOPOULOS STATED WITHOUT </p><p>HESITATION THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD WIN AN ILLEGITIMATE </p><p>ELECTION.  CLARIFYING, RAFTOPOULOS SAID THE PRESIDENT DOES </p><p>NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT TO WIN A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION, SO </p><p>WILL ACHIEVE VICTORY "BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY."  IN THE </p><p>MEANTIME, IF THE HIGH COURT ORDERS THE HOLDING OF BY- </p><p>ELECTIONS IN RESPONSE TO PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGES BY THE </p><p>MDC TO THE RESULTS IN 37 CONSTITUENCIES IN LAST JUNE\'S </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1427 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00662  02 OF 02  071601Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------C249B8  071601Z /38 </p><p>P 071559Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8186 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000662 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 02/05/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MUGABE PROBABLY WILL WIN ILLEGITIMATE ELECTION IN </p><p>2002 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00662  02 OF 02  071601Z </p><p>ELECTION, MUGABE WILL LIKELY WORK TO MARGINALIZE PARLIAMENT </p><p>AND GOVERN PRINCIPALLY BY DECREE. </p><p> </p><p>MDC\'S STRATEGY FOR 2002 </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ZANU-PF\'S TACTICS OF INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT, </p><p>RAFTOPOULOS CONTENDED, MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR THE </p><p>MDC TO DEVELOP SLOWLY AND PATIENTLY INTO A GENUINE, MATURE, </p><p>AND EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION PARTY.   THE MDC DOES NOT HAVE THE </p><p>RESOURCES EITHER TO CONFRONT HEAD-ON STATE-SPONSORED </p><p>VIOLENCE OR TO CONTEST EFFECTIVELY NUMEROUS BY-ELECTIONS. </p><p>THE MDC, RAFTOPOULOS SUGGESTED, SHOULD THUS FOCUS ITS </p><p>CAMPAIGN STRATEGY ON SEVERAL KEY ISSUES.  FIRST AND </p><p>FOREMOST, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE PARTY PAY CLOSE </p><p>ATTENTION TO ELECTION MECHANICS, PARTICULARLY GETTING ITS </p><p>SUPPORTERS REGISTERED AND ENSURING THAT THE VOTERS ROLL IS </p><p>COMPILED IN A TRANSPARENT AND ACCURATE MANNER.  THE MDC </p><p>MUST ALSO WORK HARD TO MOBILIZE OLDER RURAL VOTERS, WHO </p><p>HISTORICALLY HAVE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) RAFTOPOULOS SAID HE DID NOT HAVE A GOOD FEEL FOR </p><p>THE ARMY\'S POSITION ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, BUT EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT THE MDC SHOULD BE WORKING TO NURTURE ALTERNATIVE </p><p>VOICES WITHIN THE MILITARY AND POLICE.  THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY, RAFTOPOULOS CONTINUED, MUST ALSO ACCEPT THAT MUGABE </p><p>WILL MAKE GOOD ON HIS VOW NEVER TO PERMIT THE MDC TO RULE </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AND STRATEGIZE NOW HOW IT WILL RESPOND IF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT STEALS THE 2002 ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>DROC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00662  02 OF 02  071601Z </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) RAFTOPOULOS BELIEVES THAT ZIMBABWEAN OFFICIALS, UP </p><p>TO AND INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUGABE, WERE RELIEVED BY LAURENT </p><p>KABILA\'S DEATH, AS THE ASSASSINATED CONGOLESE PRESIDENT HAD </p><p>BECOME A PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE, INCLUDING HIS SADC ALLIES, </p><p>AND HAD POSED THE PRIMARY OBSTACLE TO PEACE.  HE SURMISED </p><p>THAT GOZ OFFICIALS CONSIDERED THE ASSASSINATION AN IDEAL </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO WITHDRAW ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS AND WOULD NOW </p><p>PRESS AGGRESSIVELY FOR THE QUICK DEPLOYMENT OF THE </p><p>REMAINDER OF MONUC FORCES.  HE AGREED THAT ZIMBABWE SEEMS </p><p>TO HAVE ABDICATED THE UPPER HAND IN THE DRC TO THE </p><p>ANGOLANS.  ONE OF THE PRIMARY DOMESTIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE </p><p>WAR IN DRC IS INCREASING REPRESSION HERE, AS THE GOZ SEEKS </p><p>TO DENY THE MDC THE ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON WIDESPREAD </p><p>RESENTMENT AMONG ZIMBABWEANS OF THEIR GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ENTANGLEMENT IN THIS COMPLICATED CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) RAFTOPOULOS IS ONE OF ZIMBABWE\'S BEST THINKERS AND </p><p>HAS AN UNCANNY KNACK FOR PREDICTING EVENTS THAT COME TO </p><p>PASS.  BECAUSE HE IS NOT IDENTIFIED WITH ANY POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY AND IS ABLE TO STEP BACK FROM THE FRAY, WE CONSULT </p><p>HIM TO FILL LACUNAE IN OUR CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK ON </p><p>POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN ZIMBABWE.  AT THIS WRITING, WE </p><p>AGREE WITH HIS ASSESSMENT THAT MUGABE COULD WELL WIN IN </p><p>2002, AMASSING THE NECESSARY MAJORITY OF VOTES IN HIS </p><p>TRADITIONAL BEDROCK OF SUPPORT, THE MASHONALAND-MASVINGO </p><p>AXIS, AND IN INTIMIDATING LARGE NUMBERS OF OPPOSITION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00662  02 OF 02  071601Z </p><p>SUPPORTERS IN THE URBAN AREAS, THE MDC\'S STRONGHOLD, INTO </p><p>STAYING HOME ON ELECTION DAY.  BARRING SOME EXTERNAL SHOCK </p><p>TO THE SYSTEM AND ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL, THIS LOOKS </p><p>LIKE A DEPRESSINGLY WINNING STRATEGY FROM OUR VANTAGE </p><p>POINT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
