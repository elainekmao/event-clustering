O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Increasing South African Leverage over Zimbabwe </p><p>in Electrical Power </p><p> </p><p>Ref: a) Harare 79  b) Harare 643  c) Harare 489 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Zimbabwe\'s growing dependence on South </p><p>African energy - and diminishing ability to pay for it - </p><p>renders the southern neighbor infinite leverage here. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Domestic power generation is in shambles, mostly </p><p>due to coal-miner Wankie Colliery\'s dilapidated state </p><p>(refs a/b).  Depending on the source, Zimbabwe now </p><p>imports 40 percent of its electrical energy.  Reportedly, </p><p>60 percent of these imports come from power giant ESKOM, </p><p>and the remainder from Mozambique\'s Cahora Bassa, the </p><p>DRC\'s SNEL and Zambia\'s ZESCO.  If these numbers are </p><p>correct, ESKOM now supplies 24 percent of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>power. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Regional energy companies, and especially Cahora </p><p>Bassa, have cut exports to an increasingly delinquent </p><p>Zimbabwe.  As a result, most Zimbabwean industries have </p><p>begun to suffer power rationing.  While not yet as </p><p>critical as the ongoing fuel and food crises, company </p><p>reps tell us the energy crisis is becoming worse each </p><p>day.  GOZ attempts to persuade exporters to pay in U.S. </p><p>dollars have made no impact (ref c). </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) We understand parastatal ESKOM has been more </p><p>timid than other power companies in coaxing the insolvent </p><p>GOZ to address arrears and has thus far maintained its </p><p>power supply at near normal levels.  It is not clear to </p><p>us what signals the RSA has been sending to ESKOM, but </p><p>its adoption of a position paralleling that of Cahora </p><p>Bassa would have a major effect here.  Purely on economic </p><p>grounds, however, we suspect ESKOM\'s magnanimity has its </p><p>limits, although we defer to Pretoria for more nuanced </p><p>insight.  Unless the GOZ reassesses policies that are </p><p>obliterating Wankie and many other companies, a more </p><p>severe energy shortfall is likely. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
