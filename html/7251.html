(U) ROME\'S SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY, A VATICAN-ENDORSED LAY </p><p>CATHOLIC NGO WITH GLOBAL REACH, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY MEDIATED </p><p>AN END TO MOZAMBIQUE\'S CIVIL WAR IN 1991, HAS LAUNCHED AN </p><p>AMBITIOUS PROGRAM TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS IN MOZAMBIQUE. </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO, WHICH HAS RETAINED ITS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE\'S DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT, REGARDS HIV/AIDS AS </p><p>THE BIGGEST THREAT TO MOZAMBIQUE\'S FUTURE AND HAS LAUNCHED </p><p>A DRUG RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT AGAINST AIDS (DREAM) PROJECT IN </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE TO PROVIDE HIGHLY ACTIVE ANTI-RETROVIRAL </p><p>TREATMENT TO PREGNANT WOMEN AND LACTATING MOTHERS.  WITH </p><p>ADEQUATE FUNDING, IT INTENDS TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO OTHER </p><p>KEY AT-RISK SECTORS IN THE COUNTRY.  A 12-MONTH CLINICAL </p><p>TRIAL HAS PROVEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, REDUCING TRANSMISSION </p><p>RATES BY UP TO 40 PERCENT AND SAVING THOUSANDS OF NEWBORNS </p><p>FROM HIV INFECTION.  THE DREAM PROJECT HAS ALREADY SECURED </p><p>SUPPORT FROM MULTINATIONAL DRUG COMPANIES, AND MOZAMBIQUE\'S </p><p>MINISTER OF HEALTH, FRANCISCO SOGNANE EXTOLLED THE BENEFITS </p><p>OF THE SANT\'EGIDIO PROJECT FOR MOZAMBIQUE\'S PEOPLE AND </p><p>URGED THAT IT BE ENLARGED TO ENCOMPASS A GREATER NUMBER OF </p><p>PEOPLE INFECTED WITH HIV/AIDS.  ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL </p><p>ALLOW THE PROJECT TO BE EXPANDED THROUGHOUT MOZAMBIQUE, AND </p><p>POTENTIALLY BEYOND. EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT DREAM FITS LIKE A </p><p>GLOVE WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S INTERNATIONAL MOTHER AND CHILD </p><p>HIV PREVENTION INITIATIVE AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE WHITE </p><p>HOUSE, USAID, AND EMBASSY MAPUTO WORK WITH SANT\'EGIDIO TO </p><p>EXPAND THIS PROMISING PROJECT ADMINISTERED BY A GROUP WITH </p><p>A PROVEN TRACK RECORD.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01508  01 OF 03  090535Z </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO: AFTER PEACE, TAKES AIM AT HIV/AIDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY, A VATICAN-APPROVED LAY </p><p>MOVEMENT -- NOT LIMITED TO CATHOLICS -- WITH MORE THAN </p><p>40,000 MEMBERS DEDICATED TO CHARITY, HUMANITARIAN, AND </p><p>CONFLICT RESOLUTION EFFORTS IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES, WAS </p><p>INSTRUMENTAL IN MEDIATING AN END TO MOZAMBIQUE\'S </p><p>DEVASTATING CIVIL WAR IN 1991.  THE COMMUNITY\'S COMMITMENT </p><p>TO MOZAMBIQUE HAS NOT ABATED SINCE THEN, AND IT IS NOW </p><p>ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ENSURING THAT THE HARD-WON PEACE LEADS </p><p>TO BETTER ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE.  TODAY, SANT\'EGIDIO RECOGNIZES THAT THE </p><p>INCREASINGLY HIGH INCIDENCE OF HIV/AIDS IN MOZAMBIQUE IS </p><p>NOW THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE NATION\'S FUTURE, DESTROYING </p><p>FAMILIES AND UNDERMINING ECONOMIC PROGRESS.  AS A RESULT, </p><p>ANDREA RICCARDI, THE KINETIC FOUNDER AND HEAD OF THE </p><p>COMMUNITY HAS DEVELOPED AN INITIATIVE TOGETHER WITH THE </p><p>SIZEABLE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY IN MOZAMBIQUE AIMED AT </p><p>REVERSING THE SPREAD OF HIV/AIDS THROUGH ANTI-RETROVIRAL </p><p>TREATMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ACCORDING TO SANT\'EGIDIO, THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS </p><p>IN AFRICA HAS BEEN BASED PREDOMINANTLY ON PREVENTING MORE </p><p>AFRICANS FROM CONTRACTING THE VIRUS.  SANT\'EGIDIO BELIEVES </p><p>THIS HAS NOT WORKED, EVEN WHILE THEY SUPPORT CONTINUED </p><p>EFFORTS AT EDUCATION AND PREVENTION.  THEY POINT OUT THAT </p><p>NO EPIDEMIC HAS BEEN OVERCOME BY PREVENTION ALONE. </p><p>MOREOVER, THEY BELIEVE THE LACK OF ACCESS TO TREATMENT </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVENTION, AS </p><p>PEOPLE FEAR BEING TESTED AND FOUND TO BE POSITIVE BECAUSE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01508  01 OF 03  090535Z </p><p>OF RESULTING SOCIAL ISOLATION AND PHYSICAL SANCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>DREAM:  TREATMENT THAT WORKS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) SANT\'EGIDIO\'S DRUG RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT AGAINST AIDS </p><p>IN MOZAMBIQUE (DREAM) PROJECT IS OFFERING ACCESSIBLE </p><p>TREATMENT TO PEOPLE WITH HIV/AIDS, BEGINNING WITH PREGNANT </p><p>AND LACTATING MOTHERS.  ANTI-RETROVIRAL DRUGS ARE </p><p>ADMINISTERED TO PREGNANT WOMEN TO SAVE BOTH MOTHER AND </p><p>CHILD, THEREBY PREVENTING A MOTHER\'S OTHER CHILDREN FROM </p><p>BECOMING ORPHANS.  CONDUCTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL </p><p>HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND VOLUNTEERS, AND WITH EXISTING </p><p>HEALTH DEPARTMENT FACILITIES AND STAFF, DREAM USES HIGHLY </p><p>ACTIVE ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY (HAART) TO PREVENT VERTICAL </p><p>(MOTHER-FETUS) TRANSMISSION OF THE HIV VIRUS.

DREAM HAS ALREADY SET UP THE FIRST TWO </p><p>MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABS IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY (MAPUTO) </p><p>AND IN THE CENTER AT BEIRA.

(U) THE FIRST RESULTS OF DREAM WERE PRESENTED AT THE </p><p>TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RETROVIRUS AND </p><p>OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS HELD IN BOSTON IN FEBRUARY.  FOUR- </p><p>HUNDRED FORTY HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS, PRIMARILY PREGNANT </p><p>WOMEN, PARTICIPATED IN THE INITIAL DREAM PROGRAM IN ORDER </p><p>TO GAUGE THE EFFECTS OF THERAPY ON MOTHER-FETAL </p><p>TRANSMISSION.  OF THESE, 240 FOLLOWED THE STANDARD THERAPY </p><p>USED IN WESTERN COUNTRIES.  MORTALITY RATES WERE LOWERED; </p><p>THE QUALITY OF THE PATIENTS\' LIFE IMPROVED MARKEDLY, AND </p><p>THE AMOUNT OF THE VIRUS IN THE BLOOD DECREASED NOTICEABLY. </p><p>ABOVE ALL, THE PROGRAM REVEALED A HIGH CONTINUING </p><p>PARTICIPATION RATE -- A POINT OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IN </p><p>A DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE MOZAMBIQUE.  THE RESULTS SHOWED </p><p>THAT EVEN IN NATIONS WITH A BASIC HEALTH SYSTEM IT IS </p><p>POSSIBLE TO USE A THERAPEUTIC MODEL THAT IMPACTS </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE RATE OF HIV INFECTION.  THE RESULTS OF </p><p>THE DREAM TRIAL ARE TO BE PUBLISHED IN AN UP-COMING EDITION </p><p>OF THE PRESTIGIOUS BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL LANCET. CLINICAL </p><p>RESULTS OF THE TRIAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET: </p><p>WWW.RETROCONFERENCE.ORG/2003/ABSTRACT/WORDHTM L/2127.HTM </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY FURTHER ELABORATED THESE </p><p>RESULTS AND PRESENTED ITS PROJECT AT A RECENT GATHERING IN </p><p>ROME ATTENDED BY EMBASSY OFFICERS.  IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE </p><p>DREAM PROJECT HAS ALREADY EARNED THE WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT </p><p>OF A VARIED GROUP OF ENTITIES RANGING FROM MULTINATIONAL </p><p>DRUG COMPANIES TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN GERMANY. </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE\'S MINISTER OF HEALTH, FRANCISCO SOGNANE, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01508  02 OF 03  090535Z </p><p>EXTOLLED THE BENEFITS OF THE SANT\'EGIDIO PROJECT FOR </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE\'S PEOPLE, AND URGED THAT IT BE EXTENDED RAPIDLY </p><p>TO ENCOMPASS A GREATER NUMBER OF PEOPLE INFECTED WITH </p><p>HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>DREAM AND USG OBJECTIVES </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) DREAM FITS LIKE A GLOVE WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MOTHER AND CHILD HIV PREVENTION INITIATIVE </p><p>FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF PREVENTIVE CARE, </p><p>INCLUDING DRUG TREATMENTS, AND BUILDING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY </p><p>SYSTEMS TO REACH AS MANY WOMEN AS POSSIBLE WITH THE CARE </p><p>THEY NEED.  IN FACT, AFTER DCM SHARED THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>JANUARY ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS NEW HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE WITH </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO, ONE OF ITS SENIOR OFFICIALS SAID HE FELT AS IF </p><p>THE PRESIDENT WAS READING FROM THEIR PROPOSAL BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE COMMON FOCUS ON ANTI-RETROVIRAL DRUGS, MOZAMBIQUE, </p><p>PREVENTING MOTH-CHILD TRANSMISSION, AND PRESERVING FAMILY </p><p>UNITS.

(U) EMBASSY BELIEVES IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND A FAITH- </p><p>BASED INITIATIVE WITH BETTER PROSPECTS THAN THE SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>DREAM PROJECT.  WE NOTE THAT THE COMMUNITY OF SANT\'EGIDIO, </p><p>FOUNDED IN ROME IN 1968, IS VATICAN-ENDORSED CATHOLIC LAY </p><p>MOVEMENT WITH MORE THAN 40,000 MEMBERS (NOT ALL CATHOLIC) </p><p>DEDICATED TO CHARITY AND HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN MORE THAN </p><p>60 COUNTRIES.  THE COMMUNITIES ARE COMMITTED TO SOLIDARITY </p><p>WITH THE POOR AND SUFFERING INCLUDING PHYSICALLY AND </p><p>MENTALLY DISABLED, HOMELESS, FOREIGN IMMIGRANTS, PEOPLE </p><p>WITH HIV/AIDS, TERMINALLY ILL PEOPLE, PRISONERS, ELDERLY, </p><p>ROMA AND SINTI, AND REFUGEES.  IT IS ALSO A LEADING FORCE </p><p>FOR ECUMENICAL DIALOGUE AS A WAY TO PROMOTE PEACE AND CO- </p><p>OPERATION AMONG RELIGIONS, AND TO RESOLVE ARMED CONFLICTS. </p><p>COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO RESOLVING THE </p><p>CONFLICTS IN MOZAMBIQUE AND GUATEMALA, AND HAVE HELPED </p><p>MEDIATE PEACE EFFORTS IN AFRICA\'S GREAT LAKES REGION AND </p><p>KOSOVO.  EMBASSY VATICAN HAS PREVIOUSLY FUNDED A </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO PROJECT IN KOSOVO THAT SEEKS TO RECONCILE SERBS </p><p>AND ETHNIC ALBANIANS AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL.  WE </p><p>MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH SANT\'EGIDIO ON A BROAD </p><p>RANGE OF AFRICAN ISSUES, AND THEY CONSULT REGULARLY WITH </p><p>SENIOR USG OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) EMBASSY VATICAN STRONGLY ENDORSES THE SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>DREAM PROJECT, WHICH DCM PASSED TO USAID MOZAMBIQUE DESK </p><p>OFFICER FOR FUNDING CONSIDERATION IN FEBRUARY.
