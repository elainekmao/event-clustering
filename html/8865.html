<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001084 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, PHUM, LI, SL, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO SEEKING U.S. APPROVAL FOR GON </p><p>OFFER OF ASYLUM TO TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1078 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On the afternoon of June 19, President Obasanjo </p><p>summoned me and acting British High Commissioner, Charles </p><p>Bird to the Statehouse for a discussion on Liberia.  Also </p><p>present were National Security Advisor LTG (ret.) Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed and Presidential Advisor for International Affairs </p><p>Ad\'Obe Obe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Obasanjo began by recounting Nigeria\'s role at the </p><p>recent Accra ECOWAS summit, noting that he, Kufuor and </p><p>other Heads of State had met privately with Taylor, telling </p><p>him he had to leave Liberia.  Obasanjo said Taylor </p><p>understood and agreed to a three-step transitional program </p><p>(REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Obasanjo also noted that he had discussed his </p><p>asylum offer with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair </p><p>at the G-8 Evian Summit.  According to Obasanjo, President </p><p>Bush did not respond to the proposal, but promised to get </p><p>back to Obasanjo.  Obasanjo said he was still willing to </p><p>offer asylum to Taylor if the U.S., U.K. and U.N. agree. </p><p>He also heard that all Liberian political parties would </p><p>request the Special Court (SCSL) to suspend the indictment </p><p>against Taylor in the interest of peace and reconciliation </p><p>in Liberia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) President Obasanjo then asked for our governments\' </p><p>likely views.  Bird said he suspected Liberia would be the </p><p>subject of Obasanjo\'s summons and had been in touch with </p><p>London just before coming to the Villa.  He said HMG was </p><p>still considering its stance on the matter, but its initial </p><p>position was that the indictment was a decision undertaken </p><p>by the SCSL; therefore the U.K. would defer to the Court on </p><p>the asylum proposal.  Bird said he would go back to London </p><p>for a definitive answer.  I told Obasanjo I was unsure of </p><p>Washington\'s position but that we would report the his </p><p>request for a USG position on the asylum offer and get back </p><p>to him as soon as possible.  I asked Obasanjo about UNSYG </p><p>Kofi Annan\'s response.  He said that Annan said the U.N had </p><p>no power over the SCSL and, therefore, would defer to it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Obasanjo said Nigeria would make the sacrifice of </p><p>accepting Taylor because his removal from Liberia could be </p><p>the most important single step toward peace in West Africa. </p><p>His motive, he said, was to save lives in Liberia and, </p><p>perhaps, beyond.  Obasanjo believes that if Taylor feels </p><p>compelled to remain in Liberia because of the war crimes </p><p>charges, he will fight to the end, even if that means </p><p>sacrificing his own life.  Moreover, Taylor will not </p><p>hesitate to spend others\' lives in the process.  Taylor </p><p>said as much to the Heads of State in Accra, Obasanjo </p><p>recalled.  Obasanjo said, "if (Taylor) is forced to stay, </p><p>he will fight dirty."  Obasanjo\'s fear is that an </p><p>increasingly desperate Taylor will foment violence and seek </p><p>to destabilize neighboring countries including Guinea, </p><p>Sierra Leone and Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Finally, Obasanjo said there was little else he </p><p>could do to help resolve the problems in Liberia if his </p><p>suggestion of asylum for Taylor is rejected.  I asked </p><p>Obasanjo about a comment he made in a prior conversation </p><p>that Taylor said he was willing to step down but wanted to </p><p>stay in Liberia.  Obasanjo considered the suggestion a non- </p><p>starter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: Obasanjo seemed to be in a hurry to get a </p><p>response back from us.  I assured him that I would try to </p><p>get Washington\'s views as soon as possible.  I request </p><p>Washington\'s urgent guidance on how to respond to </p><p>Obasanjo\'s proposal and inquiry.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
