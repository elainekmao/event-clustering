HARARE 898, B. HARARE 743 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON FEBRUARY 8, ACTING PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY (PDAS) MARK BELLAMY, CHARGE\' EARL IRVING, AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ECONOFF (NOTETAKER) MET WITH COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p>(CFU) DIRECTOR DAVID HASLUCK TO DISCUSS THE CURRENT </p><p>PLIGHT OF COMMERCIAL FARMERS IN ZIMBABWE.  HASLUCK </p><p>STATED THAT WHILE THE COMMERCIAL FARMING COMMUNITY IS </p><p>UNDER TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS FROM THE FARM </p><p>INVASIONS AND VIOLENCE BY WAR VETS, THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS ARE BEING ALLOWED TO FARM, AND SHOULD </p><p>HAVE GOOD CROP YIELDS AT THE END OF THE CURRENT GROWING </p><p>SEASON.  A CONCERN MENTIONED BY HASLUCK WAS THAT IF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS DO NOT GET GUARANTEES FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>HARVEST WINTER WHEAT (DUE FOR PLANTING IN THE APRIL/MAY </p><p>PERIOD), MANY FARMERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLANT FOR THE </p><p>SEASON.  THIS WILL LEAD TO THE GOZ HAVING TO IMPORT </p><p>LARGE QUANTITIES OF WHEAT BY THE END OF 2001.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO HASLUCK, THE CFU WILL BE GOING INTO ITS SPECIAL </p><p>CONGRESS ON MARCH 21 AS A UNIFIED ORGANIZATION.  HE </p><p>EXPECTS THAT AT THE END OF THE CONGRESS THE CFU WILL </p><p>ISSUE A STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES REGARDING ITS POSITIONS </p><p>ON COMMERCIAL FARMING, LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT. </p><p>HASLUCK STATED THAT THE CFU HAS CONSISTENTLY ATTEMPTED </p><p>TO ENGAGE THE GOZ ON A SERIOUS BASIS ON THE ISSUE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00970  01 OF 03  110550Z </p><p>LAND REFORM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE FARM INVASIONS IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 2000, BUT THAT THEY HAVE FOUND NO ONE IN THE </p><p>GOZ WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO NEGOTIATE AN AGREEMENT </p><p>WHICH WILL BE HONORED BY THE GOZ.  HASLUCK WAS EMPHATIC </p><p>THAT HE DOES NOT FAVOR SANCTIONS ON ZIMBABWE AS A WAY OF </p><p>ENCOURAGING PRESIDENT MUGABE AND THE GOZ TO CHANGE </p><p>COURSE, BECAUSE THESE WILL DEAL A DEATHBLOW TO THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE ECONOMY AND EXTRACT A HEAVY TOLL FROM THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE PEOPLE.  RATHER, HE BELIEVES THAT A COMBINATION </p><p>OF PERSONAL SANCTIONS PLACED ON PRESIDENT MUGABE AND </p><p>OTHER KEYS MEMBERS OF THE GOZ (CANCELING OF US VISAS, </p><p>FREEZING OF BANK ACCOUNTS, ETC.), COMBINED WITH </p><p>INCREASED "QUIET" REGIONAL DIPLOMACY BY THE HEADS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENTS OF NIGERIA, SOUTH AFRICA AND OTHER MEMBER </p><p>STATES OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>(SADC) COULD LEAD TO POSITIVE CHANGES IN THE COURSES OF </p><p>ACTION BEING FOLLOWED BY THE GOZ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMING STRUGGLES ON </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PDAS BELLAMY ASKED HASLUCK HOW COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>WERE HOLDING UP IN THE CURRENT CRISIS SITUATION. </p><p>HASLUCK REPLIED THAT WHILE THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS </p><p>AS A RESULT OF THE FARM INVASIONS AND VIOLENCE BY "WAR </p><p>VETS", THE VAST MAJORITY OF FARMERS ARE BEING ALLOWED TO </p><p>PROCEED WITH FARMING.  HE ADDED THAT IF THE HEAVY RAINS </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAS BEEN RECEIVING SINCE LAST FEBRUARY LET UP </p><p>IN TIME, THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS WILL HAVE GOOD TOBACCO, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00970  01 OF 03  110550Z </p><p>SOYBEAN, AND COTTON HARVESTS.  THE COMMERCIAL MAIZE </p><p>HARVEST WILL BE MUCH SMALLER HE ADDED, BUT THIS IS </p><p>BECAUSE FARMERS HAD PLANTED MUCH LESS HECTARAGE IN MAIZE </p><p>AS A RESULT OF THE FARM INVASIONS AND LOW MARKET PRICE </p><p>FOR MAIZE.  IN GENERAL, THE CATTLE HERDS OF COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS ARE QUITE HEALTHY, AND THE RECENT EUROPEAN UNION </p><p>(EU) DECISION TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW BEEF EXPORTS FROM </p><p>ZIMBABWE WILL BE A BOON FOR THE FARMERS.  HASLUCK </p><p>REVEALED THAT THE COMMERCIAL FARMING COMMUNITY, WHICH </p><p>HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN CLOSE-KNIT, HAS BEEN BROUGHT </p><p>CLOSER TOGETHER BY THE FARM INVASIONS.  THOSE FARMERS </p><p>WHOSE FARMS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AS A RESULT </p><p>OF INVASIONS AND "WAR VET" VIOLENCE ARE BEING HELPED BY </p><p>OTHER FARMERS ALLOCATING A PORTION OF THEIR CROPS TO </p><p>THESE FARMERS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) PDAS BELLAMY ASKED HASLUCK HOW THE FARM INVASIONS </p><p>WERE AFFECTING THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS FARM LABOR. </p><p>HASLUCK INDICATED THAT MOST FARMERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>KEEP THEIR FARM WORKERS ON PAYROLL, EVEN IF THEIR </p><p>FARMING HAS BEEN INTERFERED WITH.

IF THE COMMERCIAL FARMS ARE SHUT DOWN, HUNDREDS </p><p>OF THOUSANDS OF FARM WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL BE </p><p>AFFECTED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>A CONCERN OVER WINTER PLANTING </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) HASLUCK WENT ON TO SAY THAT WHILE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS ARE LOOKING TO GENERALLY GOOD HARVESTS AT THE </p><p>END OF THIS SEASON, THE PICTURE FOR WINTER PLANTING IS </p><p>QUITE DIFFERENT.  HE STATED THAT UNLESS FARMERS ARE ABLE </p><p>TO GET GUARANTEES FROM THE GOZ THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>HARVEST THE WINTER CROPS THEY PLANT, THEY WILL NOT BE </p><p>ABLE TO GET THE FINANCING THEY NEED FROM BANKS TO PLANT, </p><p>AND THEY WILL NOT RISK WHAT PERSONAL CAPITAL THEY HAVE. </p><p>HE ADDED THAT IF MANY FARMERS DO NOT PLANT FOR THE </p><p>WINTER, THIS WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT BOTH ZIMBABWE\'S FOOD </p><p>SECURITY AND HARD CURRENCY SITUATION.  THE WINTER WHEAT </p><p>CROP, WHICH IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY PLANTED BY COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS, IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE NATION.  IF FARMERS DO NOT </p><p>PLANT WINTER WHEAT, THE GOZ COULD BE FORCED TO IMPORT UP </p><p>TO 400,000 METRIC TONS OF WHEAT AT A TIME OF SCARCE HARD </p><p>CURRENCY.  BARLEY AND HOPS ARE TWO OTHER WINTER CROPS </p><p>THAT COMMERCIAL FARMERS PLANT, AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE </p><p>CROPS ARE NORMALLY EXPORTED, EARNING HARD CURRENCY FOR </p><p>THE NATION.  THESE CROPS ARE ALSO AT RISK IF THE FARMERS </p><p>DO NOT RECEIVE GUARANTEES FROM THE GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE UNION IS UNITED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00970  02 OF 03  110550Z </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) HASLUCK TOLD PDAS BELLAMY THAT THE CFU IS HEADING </p><p>INTO ITS SPECIAL CONGRESS A UNITED ORGANIZATION.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT NICK SWANEPOEL, A FORMER CFU PRESIDENT, HAD </p><p>EXCEEDED HIS AUTHORITY WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO NEGOTIATE A </p><p>SECRET DEAL WITH THE GOZ ON THE LAND ISSUE (REF A). </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HASLUCK REVEALED THAT SWANEPOEL HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE CFU IN TRYING TO GAIN GOZ </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR INITIATIVE ON LAND REFORM </p><p>(REF B), BUT NOT TO CUT ANY OTHER SECRET DEALS.  THE </p><p>TEMPORARY DISUNITY IN THE CFU WAS CAUSE WHEN SWANEPOEL </p><p>REVEALED TO THE CFU COUNCIL THAT HE HAD PROPOSED A </p><p>SECRET DEAL TO THE GOZ THAT INVOLVED, AMONG OTHER </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>POINTS, REPLACING THE CURRENT CFU EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP, </p><p>AND REPLACING DIRECTOR HASLUCK WITH A BLACK ZIMBABWEAN. </p><p>AFTER DEBATING WHAT SWANEPOEL PROPOSED, THE CFU COUNCIL </p><p>VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO REJECT THIS DEAL AND TO FULLY </p><p>SUPPORT THE CURRENT CFU LEADERSHIP.  HASLUCK REVEALED </p><p>THAT HE EXPECTED THE UPCOMING SPECIAL CONGRESS TO DEBATE </p><p>AND THEN ISSUE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF PRINCIPLES </p><p>REGARDING THE CFU POSITION ON COMMERCIAL FARMING, LAND </p><p>REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>ENGAGING THE GOZ </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) HASLUCK STATED EMPHATICALLY TO PDAS BELLAMY THAT </p><p>THE CFU HAS CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO ENGAGE THE GOZ ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT SINCE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00970  02 OF 03  110550Z </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE FARM INVASIONS IN FEBRUARY 2000.  THE </p><p>PROBLEM THAT THE CFU HAS RUN INTO IN THIS EFFORT IS THAT </p><p>THEY HAVE FOUND NO ONE THAT CAN TALK AUTHORITATIVELY FOR </p><p>THE GOZ ON THIS ISSUE OR CUT A DEAL WITH THE CFU THAT </p><p>WILL LATER BE HONORED BY THE GOZ.  HASLUCK SAID THAT </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI, INDUSTRY AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE MINISTER NKOSANA MOYO AND MINISTER </p><p>OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IGNATIUS CHOMBO WERE ALL GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS THAT THE CFU BELIEVE THEY COULD WORK WITH, BUT </p><p>NONE OF THEM CAN BE CONSIDERED TO AUTHORITATIVELY SPEAK </p><p>FOR MUGABE OR THE GOZ.  HASLUCK ADDED THAT ONE POINT THE </p><p>CFU HAS RAISED WITH THESE OFFICIALS, AND HAS RESONATED, </p><p>IS THAT IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT GRIPS </p><p>ZIMBABWE, COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE IS THE ONE SECTOR OF </p><p>THE ECONOMY THAT THE GOZ CAN COUNT ON TO PERFORM </p><p>STRONGLY AND BRING IN THE HARD CURRENCY THAT THE GOZ </p><p>DESPERATELY NEEDS.  HOWEVER, THIS IS ONLY TRUE IF THE </p><p>GOZ LETS FARMERS FARM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>NO TO SANCTIONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO5659 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00970  03 OF 03  110550Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SS-00    USIE-00 </p><p>      BBG-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------D02125  110550Z /38 </p><p>R 110547Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8391 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000970 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/09/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, EAGR, EAID, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S CFU DIRECTOR RECOMMENDS PERSONAL </p><p>SANCTIONS AND REGIONAL DIPLOMACY TO GET MUGABE TO CHANGE </p><p>COURSE </p><p> </p><p>7.

HE SAID THAT SANCTIONS WOULD </p><p>DESTROY THE ZIMBABWE ECONOMY, WHICH IS JUST LIMPING </p><p>ALONG AS IS, AND THAT THE ZIMBABWE PEOPLE WOULD BEAR THE </p><p>BRUNT OF SANCTIONS.  RATHER THAN SANCTIONS, HASLUCK </p><p>RECOMMENDED TWO SEPARATE COURSES OF ACTION.  ONE COURSE </p><p>OF ACTION WOULD BE TO ISOLATE PRESIDENT MUGABE AND TOP </p><p>OFFICIALS OF THE GOZ BY REVOKING THEIR VISAS TO TRAVEL </p><p>TO THE US, COUPLED WITH FREEZING PERSONAL ASSETS HELD </p><p>OVERSEAS.  THESE ACTIONS WOULD DIRECTLY INDICATE TO </p><p>MUGABE AND THE GOZ LEADERSHIP THAT THE ACTIONS THEY WERE </p><p>TAKING IN ZIMBABWE WERE MAKING THEM INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PARIAHS.  THE SECOND COURSE WOULD BE FOR THE USG AND </p><p>EUROPEAN NATIONS TO USE THEIR LEVERAGE WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS OF NIGERIA, SOUTH AFRICA AND THE OTHER SADC </p><p>COUNTRIES, TO INCREASE THEIR "QUIET" DIPLOMACY AND </p><p>PRESSURE ON MUGABE TO GET HIM TO CHANGE COURSE.  HASLUCK </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT SUCH DIPLOMACY AND </p><p>PRESSURE BE CONDUCTED DISCRETELY, SINCE MUGABE REACTS </p><p>VERY DEFENSIVELY TO PUBLIC PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00970  03 OF 03  110550Z </p><p>8. (C) HASLUCK PUT A BRAVE FACE ON THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS\' PLIGHT DURING HIS MEETING WITH PDAS BELLAMY. </p><p>HIS ASSERTION THAT MOST FARMERS ARE BEING ABLE TO FARM </p><p>THIS SEASON, THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE GOOD HARVESTS OF </p><p>CROPS SUCH AS TOBACCO, SOYBEANS AND COTTON, AND THAT </p><p>MOST FARMERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY THEIR FARM WORKERS, </p><p>WAS POSITIVE NEWS IN A SITUATION THAT HAS HAD MOSTLY BAD </p><p>NEWS SINCE THE FARM INVASIONS BEGAN IN FEBRUARY 2000. </p><p>HOWEVER, OTHER MEMBER OF THE CFU EXECUTIVE, AND HASLUCK </p><p>HIMSELF, HAVE SAID ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS THAT THE </p><p>VAST MAJORITY OF COMMERCIAL FARMERS DO NOT HAVE THE </p><p>RESOURCES OR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STAMINA TO CONTINUE </p><p>FARMING UNDER THESE ADVERSE CONDITIONS.  THE PRESSURE </p><p>WILL BE ON THE GOZ SOON TO OFFER GUARANTEES TO THESE </p><p>FARMERS THAT THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO PLANT AND HARVEST </p><p>WINTER CROPS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOZ WILL OFFER SUCH </p><p>GUARANTEES, AND HONOR THEM.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT </p><p>HASLUCK\'S SUGGESTIONS FOR SPECIFIC SANCTIONS DIRECTED </p><p>AGAINST MUGABE AND OTHER HIGH-LEVEL GOZ OFFICIALS, </p><p>COMBINED WITH MORE VIGOROUS QUIET DIPLOMACY AND PRESSURE </p><p>FROM ZIMBABWE\'S AFRICAN NEIGHBORS, ARE WORTHY OF </p><p>CONSIDERATION.
