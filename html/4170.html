<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 002988 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/01/2012 DERIVATIVE </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR\'S COMMENTS ON CIA 533007 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR. HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: CIA 533007 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) I question the usefulness of reftel\'s content. </p><p>If former Head of State Babangida made the remarks, his </p><p>comments were almost certainly self-serving and perhaps </p><p>consciously intended to undermine Obasanjo\'s status in </p><p>Western capitals.  President Obasanjo has his shortcomings </p><p>and there is the unfortunate possibility that a serious </p><p>misstep might occur that would result in Nigeria\'s use of </p><p>military force in Bakassi.  However, most indications are </p><p>that Nigeria hopes to maintain the status quo, and avoid </p><p>the use of force while engaging in bilateral discussion </p><p>with Cameroon. Given Nigeria\'s position thus far, I </p><p>sincerely doubt that Obasanjo would use "war" as a means to </p><p>keep himself in power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) However, given the active political </p><p>machinations afoot in Nigeria, intelligence sources </p><p>sometimes need to be carefully scrutinized to determine </p><p>their agendas. In this milieu, uncritical reporting of </p><p>self-interested, biased statements of principal political </p><p>actors will not always be useful reporting.  Misinformation </p><p>about political opponents will abound.  Reftel may also be </p><p>consistent with IBB\'s reputation for manipulative activity. </p><p>We should be on guard for this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) I have come to know President Obasanjo fairly </p><p>well.  He has many weaknesses, and he has failed to meet </p><p>expectations; however, I find it hard to believe that he </p><p>has fallen as low as Babangida would have us believe. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
