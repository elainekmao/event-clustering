(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM RICHARD A. ALBRIGHT FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ECONCHIEF RAISED REF A DEMARCHE APRIL 19 </p><p>WITH FINANCE MINISTRY UNDERSECRETARY KHALID AL- </p><p>BUSTANI.  AL-BUSTANI SAID THAT THE UAE WOULD BE </p><p>FAVORABLY DISPOSED TOWARDS CONSIDERATION OF WAYS </p><p>IN WHICH THE ARAB FUND FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT (AFESD) COULD ENGAGE POSTIVELY WITH </p><p>IRAQ.  THAT SAID, HE NOTED THAT THE UAE AS HOST OF </p><p>THE UPCOMING BOARD OF GOVERNORS MEETING -- AND AS </p><p>AN ONLY MODEST CONTRIBUTOR TO AFESD -- WOULD NOT </p><p>BE PREPARED TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE.  HOWEVER, AS LONG AS AFSED DG ABDULLATIF </p><p>AL-HAMAD WAS FULLY ON BOARD, THE UAEG OFFICIAL </p><p>PREDICTED THAT THE MATTER WOULD BE WELL IN HAND. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  AL-BUSTANI NOTED THAT THE APRIL 22-23 </p><p>GATHERING IN ABU DHABI WOULD BE BROADER THAN JUST </p><p>THE AFESD SESSION.  THE ARAB MONETARY FUND BOARD </p><p>WOULD ALSO BE MEETING, AS WOULD A NUMBER OF </p><p>SMALLER ARAB MULTILATERAL LENDING INSTITUTIONS, </p><p>SUCH AS THE ARAB AUTHORITY FOR AGRICULTURAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND THE ARAB ORGANIZATION FOR </p><p>INVESTMENT PROTECTION.  IF THE USG\'S INTEREST IS </p><p>IN SEEKING IRAQ\'S REHABILITATION, WE WOULD BE WELL </p><p>ADVISED TO CAST OUR NET MORE BROADLY THAN JUST </p><p>AFESD, THE EMIRATI REMARKED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  AL-BUSTANI\'S OBSERVATION </p><p>STRIKES US AS ON TARGET.  WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE </p><p>ARAB MONETARY FUND -- WHICH IS ACTUALLY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ORGANIZING THE APRIL 22-23 </p><p>MEETINGS -- IS CURRENTLY OWED MORE THAN 369 </p><p>MILLION USD BY IRAQ (189 MILLION IN PRINCIPAL, THE </p><p>REST IN INTEREST).  IRAQ HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS TO </p><p>THE AMF IN MORE THAN A DECADE, THE NUMBER TWO </p><p>OFFICIAL TOLD ECONOFF IN LATE 2002.  POST </p><p>THEREFORE SUGGESTS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE AFESD- </p><p>SPECIFIC POINTS OUTLINED IN REF. A, CONSIDERATION </p><p>BE GIVEN TO BROADENING THE DEMARCHE TO ASK THAT </p><p>ALL THE RELEVANT ARAB FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS </p><p>MEETING IN ABU DHABI LATER THIS MONTH TAKE THE </p><p>NECESSARY STEPS TO ENGAGE POSITIVELY WITH IRAQ AND </p><p>PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
