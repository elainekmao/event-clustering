<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000886 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ABUJA WEEKLY REVIEW: MARCH 11-15, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Northern Governors Protest National Identity Cards </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Electoral preparations were high on the agenda of the </p><p>Northern Governors when they met this week. As a result of </p><p>their discussions, the Governors issued a statement opposing </p><p>the Federal Government\'s plan to use the proposed national </p><p>identification card as the voter registration document.  The </p><p>Governors felt that making possession of the proposed ID card </p><p>a prerequisite for voting would effectively disenfranchise </p><p>many Northerners because large segments of the region\'s </p><p>population were farmers in small isolated communities or were </p><p>nomadic pastoralists. While many of these people might vote, </p><p>they probably would not bother with the cumbersome process of </p><p>obtaining an ID card, said critics of the I.D. Card proposal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Comment: The Governors\' concerns mirror comments DAS </p><p>Perry heard during a discussion with the Secretary General of </p><p>the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) in Kaduna on March 9.  The </p><p>ACF saw the identity card requirement as a conscious ploy by </p><p>the Presidency to disenfranchise the North due to growing </p><p>opposition in that region to Obasanjo\'s prospective </p><p>Presidential candidacy. Many Northerners are also incensed </p><p>about the price tag for the identity card exercise. The ACF </p><p>claims that the government has allocated more in the FY-02 </p><p>federal budget for the ID cards than for the entire </p><p>agricultural sector, the lifeline of the Northern economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>APP TO SUE GOVERNMENT OVER INEC COMMISSIONERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Count the APP among those who suspect the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration\'s electoral preparations are less than </p><p>even-handed.  APP National Chairman Yusuf Ali told reporters </p><p>this week that his party would sue the Federal Government </p><p>over the hiring of 34 Commissioners to replace the 34 </p><p>Obasanjo fired several weeks ago. (Note: Obasanjo fired all </p><p>but three of 37 INEC State Commissioners resident in the 36 </p><p>States and Abuja.  The Commissioners are the top INEC </p><p>officials in their jurisdiction and are responsible for the </p><p>preparation of the national election in their locales.) The </p><p>APP head claimed that the suit was necessary because the new </p><p>Commissioners were PDP partisans who could not be trusted to </p><p>run impartial elections. (Comment:  Many of the new </p><p>Commissioners are PDP loyalists. In at least one state, a </p><p>member of the PDP state executive was appointed to fill the </p><p>INEC posts.  It appears Obasanjo was within his legal rights </p><p>to fire and hire commissioners; however, stacking the roster </p><p>with cronies is not the way to instill confidence in the </p><p>electoral process.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Police and Military Do Not Strike; But Will Labor? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The threatened police and military strikes did not </p><p>take place March 11, as some anticipated.  The Administration </p><p>can take credit for nimbly dousing anger in the ranks of the </p><p>police force by firing IGP Smith. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) However, strike talk has not totally abated.  The </p><p>National Labour Congress issued an ultimatum that it will </p><p>call a general strike on May 1 -- International Labor Day -- </p><p>if the Federal Government does not honor its promise to </p><p>increase wages by 25 percent.  In publicizing this ultimatum, </p><p>the NLC leadership said labor had waited patiently, agreeing </p><p>to the Government\'s request to forego the agreed-upon wage </p><p>increase in 2001.  However, much to Labour\'s chagrin, the </p><p>payment for its patience was the fuel price increase at the </p><p>beginning of the year.  Now, Labour was insisting on the long </p><p>overdue wage increase.  (Comment:  To a large degree, labor </p><p>is right; the Government has reneged on its promise.  The </p><p>Government is probably delaying, in large part, because the </p><p>increase will inflate the budget deficit.  NLC leader Adams </p><p>Oshimole is still smarting from the Federal Government\'s </p><p>shabby treatment of him when the Government stonewalled talks </p><p>about the fuel price increase and successfully thwarted the </p><p>attempted general strike in January.  Oshimole probably does </p><p>not want another confrontation with the Administration but </p><p>must be seen as doing something to restore his and the NLC\'s </p><p>credibility and diminished image.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Row Between The Presidency and The House Continues </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Executive\'s relations with the House of </p><p>Representatives remain contentious. During the week, the </p><p>House opened hearings on the NITEL privatization sale.  The </p><p>sale, once hailed as the acme of GON reform efforts, is </p><p>crumbling because bidders cannot obtain the financing needed </p><p>to fund their $ 1.317 billion bid.  Clearly, the House wants </p><p>to embarrass the Administration by rubbing its nose in this </p><p>mire that a short time ago it touted as a major success. </p><p>Even more symbolic of House-Executive acrimony, Speaker </p><p>Na\'Abba publicly accused the Presidency of plotting physical </p><p>attacks against him and other House Members.  Information </p><p>Minister Jerry Gana has refuted Na\'Abba\'s allegations. </p><p>Additionally, the Presidency continues to investigate the </p><p>House Members\' salaries and emoluments, asserting that the </p><p>Members will be asked to return any excess payments received. </p><p> House Speaker Na\'Abba is increasingly being mentioned as a </p><p>possible Presidential candidate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Meanwhile, relations between the Senate and the </p><p>Executive remain cooperative, due mainly to Senate President </p><p>Anyim\'s close relationship with Obasanjo.  For example, in </p><p>recent weeks, the Senate has acted swiftly to all </p><p>Presidential appointments when advice or consent was needed. </p><p>However, this relationship may be put to a stress test if </p><p>Anyim buckles to House pressure to hold a joint session on </p><p>Obasanjo\'s Presidency similar to the debate held by the lower </p><p>chamber in late January where that body criticized Obasanjo\'s </p><p>performance as inept. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
