<p>S E C R E T STATE 192153 </p><p> </p><p>BUDAPEST PASS BELGRADE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/02/21 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AF, PTER </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE - NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A)STATE 175414 (NOTAL) AND PREVIOUS, (B)ISLAMABAD </p><p>5601 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY DONALD CAMP DEPUTY  ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS; REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  THIS TELEGRAM HAS BEEN CLEARED BY M/P (SEP). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) POSTS SHOULD DRAW FROM POINTS BELOW IN DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS REGARDING U.S. VIEWS ON THE FUTURE </p><p>OF AFGHANISTAN.  THE SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN IS FLUID. </p><p>WITH EVENTS MOVING RAPIDLY, WE ASK POSTS TO REFRAIN FROM </p><p>MAKING UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENTS ABOUT OUR POLICIES WITH </p><p>REGARD TO AFGHANISTAN.  DEPARTMENT WILL PROVIDE ALDAC </p><p>UPDATES AS THE SITUATION EVOLVES. PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE </p><p>TALKING POINTS AS NON-PAPERS WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS.  POSTS </p><p>SHOULD REFER QUESTIONS REGARDING CONTACTS WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF AFGHAN FACTIONS, INCLUDING THE NORTHERN </p><p>ALLIANCE (NA-UNITED FRONT) TO SA/PAB.  DEALING WITH THESE </p><p>GROUPS IS BEING HANDLED VERY CAREFULLY BY WASHINGTON TO </p><p>AVOID SENDING SIGNALS WHICH MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED OR </p><p>CONVEYING MIXED MESSAGES.  WE WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE </p><p>REPORTING ON SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSES FROM HOST GOVERNMENTS. </p><p>NOTE:  THIS CABLE DOES NOT ADDRESS ON-GOING INTELLIGENCE </p><p>OR MILITARY OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) TALKING POINTS </p><p> </p><p>FIGHTING TERRORISM </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>--OUR GOAL IS TO ROOT OUT AND DESTROY THE AL-QAIDA NETWORK </p><p>AND ENSURE THAT AFGHANISTAN WILL NEVER AGAIN BE A BASE FOR </p><p>TERRORIST OPERATIONS.  NOR DO WE WANT TO SEE AN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN THAT PRODUCES DRUGS, CREATES MILLIONS OF </p><p>REFUGEES, OR CONTRIBUTES TO REGIONAL INSTABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>--WE ARE NOT TARGETING ISLAM OR THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>BUT WE ARE TARGETING THE AL-QAIDA NETWORK AND THE TALIBAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  (NOTE: POSTS MAY ELABORATE ON THIS IMPORTANT </p><p>POINT FROM PUBLIC DIPLOMACY TALKING POINTS.) </p><p> </p><p>--OUR MILITARY CAMPAIGN IS GEARED AT DESTROYING TALIBAN </p><p>MILITARY CAPABILITY AND AL-QAIDA OPERATIONS THROUGH AN AIR </p><p>AND TARGETED GROUND CAMPAIGN.  WE ARE COMMITTED FOR AS </p><p>LONG AS IS NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH OUR OBJECTIVES. </p><p> </p><p>--THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE CLEAR THAT THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM IS A SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN THAT WILL OUTLAST THE </p><p>IMMEDIATE EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT OUR IMMEDIATE FOCUS </p><p>IS THE AL-QAIDA NETWORK AND ITS BASE IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>--THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT OUR MILITARY CAMPAIGN </p><p>WILL HAVE TO BE CONDUCTED DURING THE MONTH OF RAMADAN IN </p><p>ORDER TO ENSURE THAT USAMA BIN LADEN AND HIS SUPPORTERS DO </p><p>NOT STRENGTHEN THEIR POSITIONS.  WE ASK YOUR UNDERSTANDING </p><p>IN THIS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT MILITARY ACTIONS DO NOT IMPACT INNOCENT </p><p>CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>POST-TALIBAN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>--U.S. POLICY REGARDING AFGHANISTAN HAS FOUR BASIC </p><p>ELEMENTS: ERADICATION OF TERRORISM, HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND RECONSTRUCTION, REGIONAL STABILITY, AND A </p><p>PEACEFUL AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>--ELIMINATING BIN LADEN AND HIS ASSOCIATES FROM </p><p>AFGHANISTAN IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP OF THE PROCESS. </p><p>OUSTING THE TALIBAN LEADERSHIP AND HELPING A BROAD-BASED, </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT TO FORM IS ALSO A HIGH PRIORITY. </p><p>NEITHER OF THESE TASKS WILL BE EASY, PARTICULARLY GIVEN </p><p>THE ETHNIC AND REGIONAL DIVISIONS WITHIN AFGHANISTAN AND </p><p>THE DIFFICULTIES OF COALITION-BUILDING. </p><p> </p><p>--WE DO NOT WANT TO CHOOSE WHO RULES AFGHANISTAN, BUT WE </p><p>WILL ASSIST THOSE WHO SEEK A PEACEFUL AFGHANISTAN FREE OF </p><p>TERRORISM AND ADDRESSING THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC NEEDS OF ITS </p><p>PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>--WE BELIEVE THAT ALL LEGITIMATE AFGHAN GROUPS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE, ROME GROUP BASED AROUND EX-KING </p><p>ZAHIR SHAH, AND SOUTHERN PASHTUNS, MUST PLAY A ROLE IN A </p><p>BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT.  IN THE FUTURE AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>TALIBAN RANK AND FILE BELOW THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL NEED TO </p><p>INTEGRATE PEACEFULLY IN A CIVIL SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>--WE ARE IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE FORMER KING IN ROME </p><p>AND OTHER INDEPENDENT AFGHANS AROUND THE WORLD.  WE </p><p>WELCOME THE FORMER KINGS INITIATIVE TO UNITE THE ROME </p><p>GROUP, OTHER AFGHAN GROUPS AND THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE UNDER </p><p>ONE UMBRELLA -- THE SUPREME NATIONAL COUNCIL (SNC)  - </p><p>COMMITTED TO PROVIDING A POLITICAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE </p><p>TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>--THIS EFFORT IS AIMED AT LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A </p><p>BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT THAT REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF </p><p>ALL ETHNIC AND REGIONAL GROUPS AND REFLECTS THE WISHES OF </p><p>THE AFGHAN PEOPLE.  THE GOVERNMENT ENVISIONED BY THE </p><p>SUPREME NATIONAL COUNCIL WILL RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, END </p><p>TERRORISM, AND FOLLOW INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED NORMS OF </p><p>BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>--WE HAVE URGED PLAYERS IN ROME AND ELSEWHERE TO </p><p>ACCELERATE THE PLAN TO CONVENE A SUPREME NATIONAL COUNCIL, </p><p>WHILE APPEALING TO OTHER AFGHAN PARTIES TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>--WE WELCOME THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FORMER KING AND THE </p><p>NORTHERN ALLIANCE TO WORK WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE </p><p>SUPREME COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>--WE ARE AWARE OF THE PAST HISTORY ABUSE IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>INCLUDING DURING THE EARLY 1990\'S.  WE CANNOT CONDONE A </p><p>REPETITION OF THESE ABUSES OR ATTEMPTS TO RULE AFGHANISTAN </p><p>THAT EXCLUDES ANY ETHNIC GROUPS.  WE WANT AN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>THAT DOES NOT THREATEN OR IS THREATENED BY ITS NEIGHBORS. </p><p> </p><p>--PUTTING TOGETHER A POLITICAL EQUATION IS TIME-CONSUMING, </p><p>BUT SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE.  A POWER VACUUM COULD DEVELOP </p><p>IN KABUL AND CITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AT ANY TIME. </p><p>ALTHOUGH MILITARY ACTIVITY IS STILL UNDERWAY, PLANNING AND </p><p>INITIAL STEPS MUST BEGIN NOW TO COMPLEMENT OUR MILITARY </p><p>AND HUMANITARIAN OBJECTIVES.  A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE </p><p>TALIBAN COULD HELP ENCOURAGE SUPPORTERS OF THE TALIBAN TO </p><p>DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>--SECURITY OF LIBERATED AREAS WILL BE A MAJOR CONCERN. </p><p>WHILE IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE AFGHANS DEVELOP THEIR OWN </p><p>SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE, ONE ALTERNATIVE THAT WE ARE </p><p>WEIGHING IS AN INTERNATIONAL ARMED FORCE TO PROVIDE </p><p>SECURITY, PARTICULARLY IN KABUL. </p><p> </p><p>--WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE UN AND OTHER INTERESTED </p><p>NATIONS TO EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR AN EFFECTIVE SECURITY </p><p>ARRANGEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN.  WE WELCOME YOUR VIEWS ON THIS </p><p>QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>--A SUSTAINED EFFORT BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL </p><p>BE NEEDED TO ENSURE AFGHANISTANS REHABILITATION AND </p><p>FORWARD MOMENTUM.  WE WILL WORK TO REDOUBLE THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITYS PAST EFFORTS TO STABILIZE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, BUT ULTIMATELY THE AFGHAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES </p><p>MUST MAKE THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS CONCERNING THEIR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>--WE WELCOME UN SRSG LAKHDAR BRAHIMIS LEAD ROLE IN THIS </p><p>EFFORT AND URGE ALL UN MEMBERS TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT HIS </p><p>MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>--WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF THE AFGHAN </p><p>PEOPLE.  DECADES OF CONFLICT, THREE YEARS OF DROUGHT, AND </p><p>TALIBAN ABUSE AND MISMANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THEIR </p><p>PROFITEERING FROM ILLICIT OPIUM CULTIVATION AND </p><p>TRAFFICKING, HAVE BROUGHT AFGHANISTAN TO HUMANITARIAN </p><p>DISASTER. </p><p> </p><p>--WE WILL WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DEVELOP </p><p>A LONG-TERM ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION PLAN FOR A POST- </p><p>CONFLICT AFGHANISTAN.  WE ANTICIPATE A HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE DONORS CONFERENCE.  THE FOCUS OF THESE EFFORTS </p><p>WILL BE QUICK-IMPACT PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>RESETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS. </p><p> </p><p>--OUR HIGHEST IMMEDIATE PRIORITY IS TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO </p><p>DELIVER FOOD AND OTHER RELIEF INSIDE AFGHANISTAN, EVEN AS </p><p>MILITARY OPERATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>--DELIVERIES CONTINUE INTO AFGHANISTAN DESPITE THE </p><p>DIFFICULT CONDITIONS AND INCREASING TALIBAN </p><p>INTERFERENCE/LOOTING.  IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE </p><p>ASSISTANCE REACH NEEDY AFGHANS BEFORE THE ONSET OF WINTER </p><p>IN A FEW WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p>--THE U.S. HAS BEEN THE LARGEST DONOR OF HUMANITARIAN </p><p>RELIEF FOR AFGHANISTAN, HAVING PROVIDED CLOSE TO $1 </p><p>BILLION IN ASSISTANCE OVER RECENT YEARS.  THE PRESIDENT </p><p>RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AN ADDITIONAL $320 MILLION.  AT THE </p><p>OCTOBER 5 DONORS CONFERENCE IN GENEVA, THERE WERE PLEDGES </p><p>MADE BY ALL COUNTRIES FOR $736 MILLION.  ADDITIONAL </p><p>PLEDGES CONTINUE TO COME IN ON A DAILY BASIS.  UN AGENCIES </p><p>NEED CASH NOW.  IT IS IMPORTANT FOR COUNTRIES TO MAKE GOOD </p><p>ON PLEDGES WITH QUICK DISBURSEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>--DOD AIRDROPS ARE ONLY ONE PART OF OUR ASSISTANCE AND ARE </p><p>TARGETED AT HARD-TO-REACH AREAS.  WITH WINTER APPROACHING, </p><p>WE ARE ALSO LOOKING INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF AIRLIFTS (NOT </p><p>AIRDROPS) TO REACH THESE AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>--WE WOULD WELCOME YOUR VIEWS ON THESE ISSUES, AND LOOK </p><p>FORWARD TO A CONTINUING DIALOGUE WITH YOU. </p><p> </p><p>4. MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
