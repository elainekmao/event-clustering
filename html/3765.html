REASON 1.5D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) General Pyar Jung Thapa (DPOB 15 September 1946; </p><p>Siphal, Kathmandu, Nepal) was appointed Chief of Army Staff </p><p>(COAS) by King Gyanendra on September 9, 2002.  His previous </p><p>position, held since 2001, was Chief of General Staff (CGS). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Thapa has received extensive training from both the UK </p><p>and US militaries, beginning with basic training at the Royal </p><p>Military Academy at Sandhurst in 1966. He attended a platoon </p><p>commander course and weapons-training course at the School of </p><p>Infantry at Warminster, UK in 1967, followed by several </p><p>courses in tactics and administration, and army staff </p><p>training at Camberley, UK in 1977.  He graduated from US Army </p><p>Ranger training early in his career, and from the US Army War </p><p>College in 1996. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) COAS Thapa is a veteran of several campaigns in South </p><p>Asia and abroad, including two UN Peacekeeping missions.  In </p><p>1974, following his promotion to Major, he helped lead RNA </p><p>action against the Tibetan Khampas taking shelter in the </p><p>Mustang district after being displaced from Tibet.  In 1983, </p><p>as a Lieutenant Colonel, he was given command of the Shree </p><p>Singha Nath battalion and in 1986 he was appointed commander </p><p>of NEP BATT XIII in the United Nations Interim Forces in </p><p>Lebanon (UNFIL).  In 1992, he served as deputy sector </p><p>commander of United Nations Protection Forces in the </p><p>(UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Thapa has also been active in training RNA troops, </p><p>starting with a two-year assignment as an instructor at the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army School at Nagarkot from 1975 to 1977.  In </p><p>1988, as a Colonel, he was appointed as Commandant of the </p><p>Royal Nepalese Military Academy at Kharipati.  Promoted to </p><p>Major General and appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in 1998, </p><p>he was also appointed the chief coordinator for the </p><p>multinational platoon training exercise organized at the </p><p>Royal Nepalese Army Peacekeeping Training Center in 1999. </p><p>The exercise included troops from the US, Bangladesh, Sri </p><p>Lanka and Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Thapa is described by Embassy MilOff as more pragmatic </p><p>and "more of a thinker" than his predecessor, with more of a </p><p>focus on operations.  As CGS he was directly involved in the </p><p>day-to-day operation of the RNA against Nepal\'s Maoist </p><p>insurgents, equipping him for a more active role than his </p><p>predecessor General Prajwalla Rana.  He is expected to make </p><p>significant changes to the RNA command structure. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Thapa has served as Director of Military Operations, </p><p>Director of Military Training,  Director of Military </p><p>Intelligence, Director of Research and Development, Assistant </p><p>Chief of Staff, Quarter Master General and head of the Office </p><p>of the Inspector General.  He has a reputation for leading by </p><p>consensus rather than fiat, and believes the military should </p><p>stay out of politics. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) General Thapa has been awarded the Prasidha Prabal </p><p>Gorkha-Dakshin-Bahu and Bikhat Trishakti Patta decorations. </p><p>He received his high school education from St. Xavier\'s </p><p>Academy, a well-known English-language school in the capital, </p><p>and graduated with a B.A. from Tribhuvan University in 1963. </p><p>His hobbies include golf, soccer and bridge.  He is married </p><p>to Ms. Kamala Thapa and has three daughters.  Thapa has been </p><p>open and friendly with US Embassy officers over the years. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
