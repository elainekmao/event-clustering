<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 008852 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR DEC. 9-10 WASHINGTON VISIT OF AK </p><p>PARTY CHAIRMAN R. TAYYIP ERDOGAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 6856 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 8252 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 7683 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 8448 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 8382 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: As Turkey\'s strongest politician Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan is key to our ability to influence the AK Party </p><p>government and public opinion on Iraq and other strategic </p><p>U.S. interests.  His heightened sense of pride is </p><p>undiminished, indeed boosted, by the Kemalist State\'s </p><p>continuing attempts to spike his return to full public life; </p><p>treating him as if he were already head of government will </p><p>thus pay enormous dividends for U.S. influence in Turkey and </p><p>underscore to the EU our strong support for a date for </p><p>Turkish accession talks from the Copenhagen summit.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Coming off a smashing electoral victory by his AK </p><p>(Justice and Development) Party and a tour of 14 EU capitals </p><p>where he was welcomed like a head of government, unelected </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan is the new colossus in Turkish politics.  What </p><p>gave Erdogan\'s party its victory on Nov. 3 were his </p><p>reputation as a responsive mayor of Istanbul, his advocacy of </p><p>fair and just reforms, and his political magnetism across </p><p>Anatolia, a magnetism enhanced by the State\'s controversial </p><p>decision to rule him ineligible to stand for election (ref </p><p>A).  Erdogan is now determined to parlay his victory and new </p><p>national stature into a restoration of his political rights </p><p>so he may enter Parliament and assume the prime ministership </p><p>by late winter or early spring. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Despite his popularity in urban sprawls and across </p><p>Anatolia, Erdogan is far from being universally liked. </p><p>Indeed, he is loathed by most of the Establishment.  The </p><p>Establishment prefers to portray him as a mediocrely </p><p>educated, local tough guy made (too) good, a charismatic but </p><p>dangerous preacher-politician who will lead Turkey to the </p><p>Sharia.  Many political and bureaucratic insiders tell us </p><p>that, for this reason, the Deep State (ref B) will do all in </p><p>its power through legal maneuver or provocations to try to </p><p>keep Erdogan permanently off balance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In this context Erdogan\'s visit to Washington is an </p><p>excellent opportunity to promote core U.S. interests by (1) </p><p>demonstrating that we respect the democratic election results </p><p>in Turkey and the AK government\'s commitment to further </p><p>democratization; (2) strengthening our influence with AK and </p><p>Erdogan as the paramount politician in Turkey today; and (3) </p><p>convincing Erdogan, the one politician who can deliver Turkey </p><p>at this stage, to make the right decisions on Iraq, Cyprus, </p><p>and domestic political and economic reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Erdogan The Man </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Erdogan\'s charisma, defensiveness, strong intuition, </p><p>commanding (even authoritarian) presence, common touch -- </p><p>rare among Turkish politicians -- and slight swagger come </p><p>from having to make his way as a youth in the gritty Istanbul </p><p>neighborhood of Kasimpasa, attending a preacher (imam-hatip) </p><p>high school, and playing professional soccer.  He is both </p><p>prone to emotional reactions and cool in wielding political </p><p>power.  He has a huge self-image and heightened sense of </p><p>pride, both easily wounded when he thinks he is not being </p><p>shown due respect, and reacts badly to criticism.  Yet he has </p><p>proved he has a strong pragmatic streak as mayor of the 12 </p><p>million-strong Istanbul, in trying to break out of sclerotic </p><p>approaches to Cyprus, and in having a well-tuned (if </p><p>acquired) sense of timing on when to push and when to hold </p><p>back on sensitive questions like the headscarf issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Not knowing any foreign language and lacking a strong, </p><p>well-rounded education, Erdogan relies on his intuitions, </p><p>presence, and ability to bond to manage meetings with foreign </p><p>interlocutors.  He will listen intently and expects his </p><p>interlocutors to treat him and the subject seriously, even </p><p>earnestly.  At the same time, he is open to the well-timed </p><p>joke or lighter comment.  In the latter regard, Erdogan is a </p><p>passionate fan of Fenerbahce, nicknamed the Yellow Canary, </p><p>one of the big three Istanbul (and Turkish) soccer clubs; a </p><p>gift with a yellow or yellow and blue motif would be a hit, </p><p>especially if accompanied by a comment relating to his </p><p>passion for soccer.  Erdogan\'s style is to make his points </p><p>initially softly and laconically; if he meets resistance he </p><p>ratchets up his second response, becoming more stern with </p><p>each exchange on the topic.  He reacts badly to overt </p><p>pressure or implied threats.  The best way to convince him to </p><p>take a tough decision is to appeal calmly but man-to-man to </p><p>his sense of destiny as Turkey\'s leader. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Erdogan\'s Party </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ref (C) lays out AK\'s strengths and challenges as they </p><p>may affect U.S. interests.  In the latter regard, we are </p><p>seeing a post-election differentiation, and thus more of an </p><p>opening for intra-party tension, in two areas.  First, </p><p>between the party\'s parliamentary group (which just elected a </p><p>more religiously conservative set of whips than P.M. Gul </p><p>expected) and party leadership (which is more weighted to the </p><p>pragmatic group around Erdogan and Gul).  Second, between </p><p>fiery parliamentary Speaker Arinc and the calmer Gul (ref D). </p><p> Erdogan will have his hands full keeping the party together </p><p>as the strains of governing and legislating and outside </p><p>pressures from the Establishment, public opinion, and foreign </p><p>policy demands play on the fractions and fissures already </p><p>extant in this conglomerate party.  Many of our contacts from </p><p>left to center-right predict that AK will split within a </p><p>year.  Perhaps this assessment is wishful thinking tinged </p><p>with envy, but AK indeed faces marked internal stresses going </p><p>forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Erdogan\'s Government </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Erdogan is not yet in the government, but by </p><p>dominating the news he has ensured that everyone here and </p><p>abroad recognizes him as de facto -- and future de jure -- </p><p>head of government.  Gul\'s cabinet (ref E), formed under </p><p>Erdogan\'s guidance, mixes men with experience dealing with </p><p>the Deep State or bureaucracy -- Defense (DefMin Gonul is </p><p>respected by President Sezer, who is otherwise wary of the </p><p>new government), Interior, MFA, Education -- with insiders </p><p>from Erdogan\'s Istanbul municipal administration and some </p><p>with wheeler-dealer business connections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Gul will rapidly shepherd through Parliament </p><p>EU-related democratic reforms and the constitutional changes </p><p>designed to open the door for Erdogan\'s assumption of the </p><p>prime ministership, perhaps in mid- to late winter.  A large </p><p>question remains whether AK has a skillful enough pool of </p><p>talent to staff the Undersecretary levels and below.  We thus </p><p>share Turkish observers\' questions about how well AK will be </p><p>able (a) to respond pragmatically on foreign policy; (b) to </p><p>maintain credible economic reform and banking supervisory </p><p>standards; and (c) to carry out its intended strong reform </p><p>and anti-corruption drives when faced with deeply entrenched </p><p>interests and practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>How to Influence Erdogan </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Given Erdogan\'s wariness toward the Turkish </p><p>bureaucracy, it will be key to draw Erdogan aside from his </p><p>bureaucratic minders to elicit his true thinking on sensitive </p><p>topics.  At the same time, U.S. interlocutors can enhance the </p><p>impact of their message if they have aides cultivate his </p><p>closest advisors, especially Erdogan\'s closest foreign policy </p><p>advisor Omer Celik.  In the wake of the Dec. 3 </p><p>Wolfowitz-Grossman visit, we suggest the following approach </p><p>to Erdogan on four key questions: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Iraq: emphasize the benefits to Turkey of full cooperation </p><p>in coalition preparations for a possible military operation </p><p>and convince Erdogan he can sell maximum cooperation as not </p><p>letting foreigners control Turkey\'s future: "if you don\'t </p><p>play the game you don\'t make the rules." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--EU and reform: in reiterating the strength of our support </p><p>for Turkey\'s candidacy, give Erdogan our latest information </p><p>on EU member states\' stance (as we have been doing regularly </p><p>in Ankara) to prepare him for his lobbying in Copenhagen, </p><p>emphasize the crucial impact of further reform, and urge him </p><p>to portray the Summit decision on Turkey positively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Cyprus: urge Erdogan to get Denktas to reach a settlement </p><p>soonest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Economic reform, anti-corruption, anti-torture measures, </p><p>and open government: note that Erdogan\'s party will be </p><p>measured at home most by these four yardsticks, note the </p><p>centrality of maintaining reform momentum and strong, clean </p><p>banking regulation for the government\'s image and for </p><p>preserving market confidence (Erdogan is coming under the </p><p>sway of corrupt and failed bank owners). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
