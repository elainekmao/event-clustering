<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003455 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA AND PRM, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IN ABSENCE OF IRAQI EMBASSY, IRAQIS IN JORDAN SEEK </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM US EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p>REF: CPA BAGHDAD 041713Z JUN 03 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is an action request; see para 4. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Embassy Amman\'s front gate receptionist reports that 10 </p><p>to 15 Iraqi nationals per day are approaching the embassy to </p><p>seek assistance, primarily on Iraqi citizen service issues. </p><p>The Iraqis explain that without a functioning Iraqi embassy </p><p>in Amman, they have nowhere to turn on issues such as </p><p>residency permits, permission to leave Jordan after having </p><p>overstayed their legal residency, and commercial disputes. </p><p>The Iraqis claim that the Iraqi embassy routinely intervened </p><p>with the GOJ on their behalf to resolve these issues.  The </p><p>Iraqis add that they are afraid to approach GOJ authorities </p><p>on their own, as most are here illegally and fear that they </p><p>will be jailed or deported if they make their presence known </p><p>to the GOJ.  In one typical case, an Iraqi national reported </p><p>to the receptionist that he has not been paid by his employer </p><p>in six months and needs help in obtaining his back wages. </p><p>This Iraqi reportedly wants to leave Jordan to return to Iraq </p><p>but, without his wages, cannot afford either the fine for his </p><p>illegal overstay or the costs of traveling to Iraq and </p><p>reestablishing his life there.  (NOTE:  Fully half of the </p><p>250,000 to 300,000 Iraqis resident in Jordan are believed to </p><p>be here illegally.  As most illegal Iraqis are employed as </p><p>casual laborers, they cannot afford to pay the fines required </p><p>in order to leave the country legally.  Those who cannot </p><p>afford to pay the fines are deported and "blacklisted," their </p><p>names entered on a watch list and prevented from entering </p><p>Jordan again. The GOJ reportedly has decided that fines will </p><p>not be levied upon Iraqis returning to Iraq; we will seek </p><p>confirmation and report septel.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  The front gate receptionist reports that a handful of </p><p>Iraqis first began approaching the embassy for assistance in </p><p>March but that the steady flow only began in the last few </p><p>weeks.  Since May 14, the Iraqi embassy has been shuttered, </p><p>with a sign beside the door announcing that the embassy is </p><p>closed and no longer able to provide services to Iraqi </p><p>citizens.  When conoff phoned the Iraqi embassy on June 10, </p><p>an Iraqi diplomat answered the phone and said that the </p><p>embassy was open only for humanitarian emergencies. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Action request:  Absent any specific instructions from </p><p>the Department on this issue, we are informing Iraqi </p><p>nationals that the US Embassy is unable to provide assistance </p><p>to Iraqi nationals and suggesting that they turn to local </p><p>NGOs that assist refugees and those living in refugee-like </p><p>conditions.  We recommend that the Coalition Provisional </p><p>Authority send the Iraqi MFA inspection team to Amman as soon </p><p>as possible (ref), as -- in the absence of a functioning </p><p>Iraqi Embassy -- the number of Iraqis seeking assistance at </p><p>the US embassy is likely to grow. </p><p> </p><p>5.  CPA Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
