AT ITS THIRD REGULAR SESSION (OCTOBER 21-25), THE WORLD </p><p>FOOD PROGRAM EXECUTIVE BOARD APPROVED A PROTRACTED RELIEF </p><p>AND RECOVERY OPERATION (PRRO) FOR THE WEST AFRICA COASTAL </p><p>REGION - ONE YEAR (JANUARY- DECEMBER 2003), VALUED AT USD </p><p>56.81 MILLION, TO ASSIST 789,430 (INCLUDING 50,000 </p><p>CONTINGENCY CASELOAD) BENEFICIARIES/ANNUM. THE WEST AFRICA </p><p>COASTAL REGION HAS BEEN IN A STATE OF DEEP CRISIS FOR MANY </p><p>YEARS. LIBERIA IS ONCE AGAIN AT THE EPICENTRE OF A CONFLICT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05778  01 OF 03  291636Z </p><p>THAT COULD CONTINUE TO SPREAD TO THE REGION. THE CURRENT </p><p>CRISIS IN COTE D\'IVOIRE HAS ALREADY CAUSED MAJOR INTERNAL </p><p>DISPLACEMENTS WITHIN THE COUNTRY (180,000 PEOPLE SINCE 19 </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2002) AND MAY RESULT IN EVEN LARGER POPULATION </p><p>DISPLACEMENTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WEST AFRICAN REGION, </p><p>EFFECTIVELY EXPANDING THE THREAT TO PEACE AND SECURITY WELL </p><p>BEYOND COTE D\'IVOIRE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. WITH NO SUSTAINABLE POLITICAL SOLUTION IN SIGHT IN </p><p>LIBERIA, THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION THERE IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>REMAIN CRITICAL THROUGH 2003 AND THE PROSPECTS FOR RECOVERY </p><p>IN NEIGHBORING GUINEA AND SIERRA LEONE ARE LIKELY TO SUFFER </p><p>AS A RESULT. </p><p> </p><p>3. SIGNIFICANT NEW INFLUXES OF LIBERIAN REFUGEES HAVE BEEN </p><p>RECORDED IN SIERRA LEONE, GUINEA AND COTE D\'IVOIRE (UP TO A </p><p>CERTAIN EXTENT, BEFORE THE CRISIS), DUE TO THE </p><p>INTENSIFICATION OF CONFLICT IN LIBERIA, WHICH HAS CREATED A </p><p>NEW POPULATION OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (135,300 AS </p><p>OF SEPTEMBER 2002). MOREOVER, DEPENDING ON THE EVOLUTION OF </p><p>THE CURRENT CRISIS IN COTE D\'IVOIRE, POPULATION INFLUXES IN </p><p>GUINEA AND LIBERIA ARE TO BE EXPECTED. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE CURRENT PROTRACTED RELIEF AND RECOVERY (PRRO) </p><p>OPERATION (10064.0) IS FACING A SHORTFALL OF 12,688 MT, OR </p><p>12 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL REQUIREMENTS. AS THE EARLY RESPONSE </p><p>MECHANISMS PROVIDED FOR UNDER THIS REGIONAL OPERATION HAVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05778  01 OF 03  291636Z </p><p>BEEN ACTIVATED TO RESPOND TO URGENT FOOD NEEDS IN COTE </p><p>D\'IVOIRE (INCLUDING THE USE OF WFP AIRCRAFT BASED IN CONAKRY </p><p>TO AIRLIFT HIGH-ENERGY BISCUITS TO YAMOUSSOUKRO), </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO REPLENISH THE PIPELINE </p><p>OF THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH "LOANED" RESOURCES TO COTE </p><p>D\'IVOIRE. </p><p> </p><p>5. SHORTFALLS WILL BECOME PARTICULARLY CRITICAL AT THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF 2003, WHEN THE NEW PRRO WILL START. LIBERIA </p><p>WILL REPORTEDLY FACE SHORTFALLS FOR MOST OF THE COMMODITIES </p><p>AS EARLY AS JANUARY 2003. GUINEA WILL LACK CEREALS, PULSES </p><p>AND OIL FROM MARCH 2003 ON. SIERRA LEONE WILL FACE A BREAK </p><p>IN ITS PIPELINE IN EARLY 2003, AS REQUIREMENTS ARE LIKELY TO </p><p>INCREASE DUE TO THE CURRENT TREND IN THE INFLUX OF LIBERIAN </p><p>REFUGEES (75,000 ESTIMATED AT THE END OF 2002). AS FOR COTE </p><p>D\'IVOIRE, REINTEGRATED IN THE REGIONAL OPERATION AS OF </p><p>JANUARY 2003, FOOD COMMODITIES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED INTER </p><p>ALIA TO TAKE CARE OF THE CASELOAD OF LIBERIAN REFUGEES IN </p><p>NICLA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>WFP EXECUTIVE BOARD APPROVAL OF WEST AFRICA COASTAL PRRO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3088 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05778  02 OF 03  291637Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PRM-00   SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------107D47  292059Z /38 </p><p>P 291511Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7115 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABIDJAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY FREETOWN </p><p>AMEMBASSY MONROVIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CONAKRY </p><p>AMEMBASSY DAKAR </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERN </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2441 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2971 </p><p> </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05778  02 OF 03  291637Z </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 005778 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR A/S IO HOLMES, A/S PRM DEWEY, IO/EDA WINNICK </p><p>USAID FOR AA/DCHA WINTER, D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS, DCHA/PPE LYNCH </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR MCHAMBLISS/RTILSWORTH </p><p>USUN NEW YORK FOR CSERWER </p><p>NAIROBI FOR REDSO </p><p>TOKYO FOR USAID REP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: WFP EXECUTIVE BOARD APPROVAL OF PROTRACTED RELIEF </p><p>AND RECOVERY OPERATION (PRRO) FOR WEST AFRICA COASTAL REGION </p><p>- USD 56.81 MILLION </p><p> </p><p>6. THE BOARD APPROVED THIS PRRO FOR ONE YEAR (JANUARY </p><p>-DECEMBER 2003), VALUED AT USD 56.81 MILLION, TO ASSIST </p><p>789,430 BENEFICIARIES (INCLUDING 50,000 CONTINGENCY </p><p>CASELOAD). THE BOARD AGREED THAT THIS PROGRAMMING INSTRUMENT </p><p>WILL PERMIT WFP TO RESPOND EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO </p><p>THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THIS OPERATION. SIMPLY, THE CONTINUOUS </p><p>INSTABILITY OF THE REGION REQUIRES MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN </p><p>THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES, WHERE  WFP HAS TO FREQUENTLY </p><p>RESPOND TO UNEXPECTED MASS MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>US DELEGATION INTERVENTION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05778  02 OF 03  291637Z </p><p> </p><p>7. USDEL TOOK NOTE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF NON-FOOD ITEMS </p><p>(NFIS) IN ANY REFUGEE/IDP OPERATION AND ENCOURAGED WFP TO </p><p>WORK CLOSELY WITH UNHCR TO ENSURE THAT THESE ITEMS ARE BEING </p><p>PROVIDED BY THE PROPER U.N. AGENCY, SO THAT HIGH-VALUED FOOD </p><p>COMMODITIES ARE NOT BARTERED FOR NFIS.  THIS, AS WELL AS </p><p>POST-DISTRIBUTION MONITORING (THAT CONSTITUTE PART OF THE </p><p>REVISED WFP/UNHCR MOU), ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT REQUIRE </p><p>CONSTANT VIGILANCE AND DEDICATION BETWEEN THE TWO UN </p><p>AGENCIES.  USDEL NOTED WFP\'S EFFORTS TO BEGIN POST- </p><p>DISTRIBUTION MONITORING IN MANY OF ITS OPERATIONS IN WEST </p><p>AFRICA, BUT ALSO POINTED OUT THAT SUCH MONITORING IS STILL </p><p>MISSING FROM PARTICULAR REFUGEE AND IDP OPERATIONS AND ASKED </p><p>THAT THIS BE PROMPTLY RECTIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>8. USDEL FURTHER NOTED THAT ON A RECENT MISSION TO GUINEA </p><p>AND LIBERIA, A USAID TEAM FOUND DELAYS AND PROBLEMS WITH </p><p>REGISTRATION OF LIBERIAN REFUGEES IN GUINEA AND OF IDPS IN </p><p>LIBERIA.  IN EACH CASE, THE WFP TEAM IS QUITE AWARE OF THE </p><p>PROBLEMS AND WORKING TO RESOLVE THEM, BUT USDEL HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF A COMPETENT REGISTRATION PROCESS AS A </p><p>PREREQUISITE TO A DISCIPLINED FOOD DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>9. MOREOVER, USDEL REQUESTED THAT THE RATION SIZE FOR IDPS </p><p>IN LIBERIA BE ASSESSED TO ENSURE THAT THE BASIS FOR THE </p><p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN 2,100 KILOCALORIES (KC) AND 1,800 KC IS </p><p>SOUND. WE EXPECTED THAT THE RESULTS FROM THE UPCOMING FOOD </p><p>SECURITY ASSESSMENT OF THE REFUGEES IN GUINEA WOULD ALLOW </p><p>FOR A DECREASE IN RATIONS, INSOFAS AS REFUGEES HAVE HEARTILY </p><p>ENGAGED IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05778  02 OF 03  291637Z </p><p>10. FINALLY, IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT THE USAID MISSION TO </p><p>GUINEA OBSERVED THE FRUITS OF FAO/WFP COLLABORATION IN AND </p><p>AROUND THE REFUGEE CAMPS IN ALBADARIAH IN THE FOREST REGION </p><p>(AS FUNDED BY STATE/PRM). AS A RESULT OF THIS INVESTMENT, </p><p>THE SIERRA LEONEAN REFUGEES WILL BE RETURNING HOME WITH A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT HARVEST. WE EXPRESSED SATISFACTION IN WITNESSING </p><p>THE TWO AGENCIES WORKING TOGETHER ON A STRATEGY FOR FOOD </p><p>SECURITY IN SIERRA LEONE AND USDEL STRONGLY ENCOURAGED THE </p><p>CONTINUATION OF THESE LINKAGES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. USMISSION SEES A CONTINUING VITAL ROLE FOR WFP AND ITS </p><p>UN SISTER AGENCIES IN RESPONDING TO THE CONTINUING CRISIS IN </p><p>THE WEST AFRICA COASTAL REGION. CLEARLY, THE DETERIORATION </p><p>OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN LIBERIA, COUPLED WITH </p><p>THE RECENT SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS IN COTE D\'IVOIRE, WILL </p><p>FURTHER WEAKEN THE ALREADY DEVASTATED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE REGION.
