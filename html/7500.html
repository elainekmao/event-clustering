<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000670 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS(FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY - 4/14 WASHINGTON CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>1. On April 14 Deputy Secretary Armitage hosted an </p><p>international conference on Sri Lanka for representatives </p><p>of 21 countries and 16 international organizations who </p><p>gathered to discuss Sri Lanka\'s peace negotiations, and </p><p>international assistance for the Island\'s development and </p><p>reconstruction.  As expected, the Sri Lankan media\'s </p><p>response to the conference was quick, plentiful, and mainly </p><p>positive.  All of the Island\'s major telecasters covered </p><p>the story in their 4/15 evening newscasts.  On 4/16 and </p><p>again on 4/17 the conference received front-page coverage </p><p>in most English and vernacular dailies.  As of 4/17 one </p><p>English and one Tamil daily had commented editorially. </p><p>Both editorials were critical of the conference, but we </p><p>anticipate that the post-holiday weekender op-ed coverage </p><p>will be heavy and more nuanced. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Television. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2. In their 4/15 newscasts Sri Lankan telecaster headlined </p><p>the conference with stories such as "Washington conference </p><p>pledges support for Sri Lanka," "$3 billion dollar </p><p>assistance for Sri Lanka for three years from Washington </p><p>conference," "In Washington conference, three years </p><p>assistance agreed at the rate of $1 billion per year," and </p><p>"U.S. assistance assured in Washington conference." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Newspapers. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>3. Newspaper headlines were invariably positive.  "Global </p><p>support for \'momentum of peace\' in Sri Lanka" and "India </p><p>for united Sri Lanka" said the government-owned English </p><p>daily, while the government-owned vernaculars used </p><p>headlines such as "SLG\'s Reawakening Sri Lanka fully </p><p>endorsed" and "\'Last chance for peace -- if we fail, no </p><p>more possibilities\' says [Milinda] Moragoda," one of the </p><p>GOSL\'s chief negotiators.  The independent press was </p><p>equally effusive, e.g., "$3 billion assistance for Sri </p><p>Lanka," "Plans to disburse 1 billion per annum," and </p><p>"Assistance for Sri Lanka - Rs.100,000 each year, for 3 </p><p>years" said the Sinhala independents, and Sri Lanka\'s major </p><p>English independent daily, the MIRROR, wrote -- in </p><p>reference to the fact that 4/14 was New Years Day in Sri </p><p>Lanka -- "biggest new year gift for Lanka:  aid donors </p><p>pledge $2 billion a year at Washington meeting."  Even the </p><p>skeptical Upali Group\'s headlines applauded.  The Group\'s </p><p>Sinhala daily said "Washington Conference pledges absolute </p><p>support for \'Re awakening of Sri Lanka,\'" while its English </p><p>daily said "U.S., Japan, IMF praise peace effort," adding </p><p>only that "LTTE must give up terrorism in word and deed - </p><p>Armitage." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Editorials. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>4. Under the headline "Washington Summit" the independent </p><p>Tamil daily SUDAR OLI focused on the absence of the LTTE, </p><p>saying that the "The Washington meeting was like a wedding </p><p>without the bridegroom."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"A meeting to encourage international cooperation and </p><p>support for the peace process and development was held in </p><p>Washington under the chairmanship of U.S. Deputy Secretary </p><p>of State Richard Armitage....  Representatives of 21 </p><p>countries and 16 international organizations attended the </p><p>meeting....  But no one represented the Tigers because the </p><p>U.S. did not invite them. </p><p> </p><p>"The Tigers were invited to the meeting in Norway, and they </p><p>attended.  They have been invited to the Tokyo Donor Summit </p><p>in June, and have decided to attend.  But to the Washington </p><p>meeting the Liberation Tigers, the sole representatives of </p><p>the Tamil people, were not invited. </p><p> </p><p>"U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard [Armitage] knows </p><p>that the Tigers are unhappy....  He explained why they were </p><p>not invited.  Because the LTTE is on the list of Terrorist </p><p>Organizations, inviting them would have been illegal.  He </p><p>also said that the Liberation Tigers should renounce </p><p>violence and terrorism by words and deeds. </p><p> </p><p>"The U.S. has already said that the LTTE has never been </p><p>involved in terrorist activities in the U.S. and that they </p><p>have no connection with any other international terrorist </p><p>organization. </p><p> </p><p>"The Liberation Tigers have signed an MOU with the </p><p>government and the ceasefire has held for over a year.  Six </p><p>rounds of talks have been convened, and Armitage himself is </p><p>happy with the progress.... </p><p> </p><p>"Even under these circumstances, however, he requests the </p><p>Tigers to renounce violence by words and deeds.  What is </p><p>the meaning of this?  Why is he asking those who are not </p><p>involved in violence to renounce violence? </p><p> </p><p>"Is it correct to label as violence the LTTE actions, taken </p><p>prior to the MOU, to win the rights of the Tamil people? </p><p>Then the Sri Lankan government was also engaged in </p><p>violence. </p><p> </p><p>"And what can we call the killing of innocent people in </p><p>today\'s Iraqi war?  Law should be equal to everyone. </p><p> </p><p>"The Washington meeting was like a wedding without the </p><p>bridegroom." </p><p> </p><p>5. Under the headline "Cart before the Horse" the typically </p><p>skeptical opposition English daily ISLAND complained that </p><p>giving aid to the LTTE does not promote peace.  Excerpts: </p><p>"American officials such as Mr. Armitage poured ice cold </p><p>water on the hot heads of the Wanni when they were not </p><p>extended an invitation to the Washington Seminar although </p><p>the Tigers were key players. Anton Balasingham, the LTTE </p><p>spokesman... even threatened to keep out of the Tokyo </p><p>Conference if they were not invited to Washington. Armitage </p><p>very coolly pointed out `We do not yet see a rational for </p><p>lifting the designation as a foreign terrorist </p><p>organisation. Our position is crystal clear. The LTTE must </p><p>unequivocally renounce terrorism in word and deed, if we </p><p>are to consider withdrawing the designation\'." </p><p>"We have been very hard on the government, the Norwegian </p><p>peace monitors and even western nations involved for </p><p>looking away from acts of terrorism of the LTTE. The </p><p>thinking behind this indulgent attitude on terrorism is </p><p>that it is for the `greater good\'. Ignore these `minor </p><p>infringements\' - even if they be smuggling of arms, </p><p>abduction of children and sinking of ships\' - for the </p><p>`Peace Process\' has to be saved, it is claimed. But one </p><p>year and four months of the `Peace Process\' have passed and </p><p>terrorism continues unabated.""Mr. Armitage has said: </p><p>`Indeed. I believe that negotiations......have reached </p><p>animportant point, on where an infusion of international </p><p>support could add an unstoppable force to this momentum of </p><p>peace\'. We agree that continued moral support would indeed </p><p>yield positive results but material assistance to a region, </p><p>run by a group still committed to terrorism will only add </p><p>momentum to their barbaric ways of governance and not to </p><p>peace." </p><p>"While it is extremely desirable and tempting to commence </p><p>rehabilitation and reconstruction as soon as possible, it </p><p>will be prudent on the part of all those who want the </p><p>people of the North and East to live under a pluralistic </p><p>democratic regime to hold back this assistance till a final </p><p>agreement has been signed and a durable peace achieved." </p><p>"Pumping of massive assistance before democracy and a </p><p>durable peace is established into regions under terrorism </p><p>is tantamount to placing the cart before the horse." </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
