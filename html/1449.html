OVER LUNCH </p><p>BEFORE THE EVENT, IN CANDID DISCUSSIONS IN ENGLISH WITH </p><p>SENIOR STAFF OF THE FIRST LADY\'S OFFICE, THE SEVEN </p><p>VIETNAMESE PANELISTS IN ATTENDANCE SHARED BALANCED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02777  01 OF 06  261043Z </p><p>ASSESSMENTS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FACING VIETNAMESE WOMEN. </p><p>BY CONTRAST, WHEN THEY SPOKE AT THE FORUM ITSELF, IN THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF SENIOR COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS, MOST OF THE </p><p>PANELISTS\' PRESENTATIONS WERE BLAND AND PROPAGANDISTIC. </p><p>ONE PANELIST SAID LATER THAT, ON THE WAY TO THE PUBLIC </p><p>EVENT, SHE WAS TOLD BY A COLLEAGUE THEIR PRESENTATIONS </p><p>SHOULD BE IN VIETNAMESE (AS AN ISSUE OF "SOVEREIGNTY"). </p><p>SHE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THREE PARTICIPANTS READ TEXTS </p><p>STAMPED "OFFICIALLY APPROVED" BY THE AUTHORITIES, EVEN </p><p>THOUGH ONLY ONE OF THE THREE WAS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. </p><p>SIMILAR TO THE CHOREOGRAPHED REACTIONS FOR STUDENTS IN THE </p><p>AUDIENCE FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH (REF B), VIETNAMESE </p><p>AUTHORITIES DELIBERATELY SCRIPTED KEY PANELISTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMMENTS </p><p>OF SOME FORUM PARTICIPANTS HIGHLIGHT WHAT ONE PANELIST </p><p>LATER CALLED THE TWO VERY DIFFERENT "CULTURES" OF VIETNAM </p><p>-- ONE OFFICIAL, FORMAL AND INSISTENT ON CENTRALIZED </p><p>CONTROL; THE OTHER INFORMAL, OPEN TO CANDID DIALOGUE AND </p><p>INCREASED DEALINGS WITH THE U.S.  THE WOMEN IN THE FORUM </p><p>REPRESENTED THE COMPETING WORLDVIEWS OF THESE "TWO </p><p>VIETNAMS" -- ONE WHICH LOOKS LARGELY TO THE PAST; THE OTHER </p><p>FOCUSED ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE.  THE </p><p>FORWARDING-LOOKING CAMP INCLUDED A GROUP OF ENTREPRENEURIAL </p><p>WOMEN OF DIFFERENT GENERATIONS WHO READILY AGREED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE FORUM AND CLEARLY RELISHED PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>GREATER ENGAGEMENT WITH THE U.S.  IN THE OTHER CAMP WERE </p><p>PATERNALISTIC OFFICIALS WHO SOUGHT TO CONTROL AND LIMIT THE </p><p>MESSAGE, PUBLICITY AND ATTENDEES FOR THE FORUM.  PARANOID </p><p>ABOUT MAINTAINING CONTROL, INSISTENT ON MICRO-MANAGING </p><p>EVERY FACET, OFFICIALS REPRESENTING THIS CAMP HAGGLED FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02777  01 OF 06  261043Z </p><p>HOURS OVER THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE FOR THE EVENT.   IN MANY </p><p>WAYS, THE DIFFERENT CULTURES OF THE "TWO VIETNAMS" </p><p>SYMBOLIZE BROADER DIFFERENCES IN SOCIETY THAT WERE ON </p><p>DISPLAY DURING THE VISIT OF THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY -- </p><p>BETWEEN AN ENTREPRENEURIAL PEOPLE EAGER FOR GREATER </p><p>ENGAGEMENT WITH THE U.S. AND A PATERNALISTIC STATE </p><p>INSISTENT ON STABILITY AND CONTROL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE IMPACT OF THE FIRST LADY\'S WOMEN\'S FORUM </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE FIRST LADY\'S FORUM WITH WOMEN LEADERS IN HANOI, </p><p>HELD NOVEMBER 18 AS PART OF THE PRESIDENT\'S HISTORIC VISIT </p><p>TO VIETNAM, HIGHLIGHTED MAJOR CHALLENGES FACING VIETNAMESE </p><p>WOMEN AS THEY SEEK FULL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL </p><p>EQUALITY (REF A).  LIKE THE PRESIDENT\'S TRIP IN GENERAL, </p><p>HANOI HAD NOT SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS ROUNDTABLE </p><p>DISCUSSION, PULLING TOGETHER SEVEN WOMEN AND ONE MAN FROM </p><p>DIFFERENT GENERATIONS AND A RANGE OF PROFESSIONS AND </p><p>PERSPECTIVES.  THE DISCUSSION FRAMEWORK AND THE UNIFYING </p><p>COMMENTS BY MRS. CLINTON HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANT </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS OF VIETNAMESE WOMEN IN IMPROVING WORKING </p><p>CONDITIONS AND PRESSING FOR EQUALITY IN LAW AS WELL AS </p><p>REALITY.  THE FORUM ALSO FOCUSED ON CONTINUING CHALLENGES, </p><p>INCLUDING PROBLEMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THE SPREAD OF </p><p>HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) INCLUDED IN THE FORUM WERE SEVERAL OF THE MOST </p><p>PROMINENT WOMEN OFFICIALS IN VIETNAM, INCLUDING MINISTER OF </p><p>LABOR NGUYEN THI HANG AND VIETNAM WOMEN\'S UNION PRESIDENT </p><p>HA THI KHIET, WHO GAVE WELCOMING REMARKS.  BOTH OF THEM ARE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF </p><p>VIETNAM (CPV).  PANELISTS INCLUDED A THREE-TERM MEMBER OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, A LONG-TIME LEADER OF THE VIETNAM </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, AN EXECUTIVE VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF ONE OF VIETNAM\'S PRIVATIZED FORMER STATE-OWNED </p><p>FIRMS, AND THE HEAD OF A QUASI-OFFICIAL NGO ADVOCATING FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02777  02 OF 06  261043Z </p><p>WOMEN\'S RIGHTS.  THREE YOUNGER PANELISTS WERE A MALE </p><p>RESEARCHER ON HIV/AIDS, A WOMAN CONSULTANT AT UNDP, AND A </p><p>15-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO WAS VIETNAM\'S DELEGATE TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL YOUTH PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMING ON THE HEELS OF MRS. CLINTON\'S ELECTION TO </p><p>THE U.S. SENATE, THE FORUM SYMBOLIZED FOR VIETNAMESE WOMEN </p><p>THE GROWING POLITICAL CLOUT OF WOMEN LEADERS AROUND THE </p><p>WORLD, AND THIS MESSAGE WAS NOT LOST ON THE FORUM\'S </p><p>ATTENDEES.  SEVERAL STUDENTS AND WOMEN PROFESSIONALS IN </p><p>THEIR 20S AND 30S TOLD EMBOFFS AFTER THE FORUM THEY WERE </p><p>INSPIRED BY MRS. CLINTON\'S CALL FOR WOMEN TO IMPROVE THEIR </p><p>EDUCATION AND SKILLS AND TO SEEK GREATER LEADERSHIP IN </p><p>SOCIETY.  HOWEVER, MANY IN THE AUDIENCE ALSO EXPRESSED </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT THERE WAS SO LITTLE CANDOR AND INTERACTION </p><p>AMONG THE PANELISTS AND BETWEEN THE PANELISTS AND THE </p><p>AUDIENCE.  IN RETROSPECT, IT IS CLEAR THIS WAS A DELIBERATE </p><p>EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>IN VIETNAM THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE STILL MATTERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) IN THE WEEKS PRIOR TO THE FORUM, REPRESENTATIVES OF </p><p>THE FIRST LADY\'S OFFICE AND EMBASSY ENGAGED IN PROTRACTED, </p><p>HAIR-SPLITTING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE VIETNAMESE SIDE OVER </p><p>EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FORUM -- THE PARTICIPANTS, MESSAGE AND </p><p>FORMAT, EVEN THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE.  THE FIRST LADY\'S </p><p>STAFF CAREFULLY CHOSE THE PANELISTS SO THEY WOULD REPRESENT </p><p>A BROAD MIX OF PERSPECTIVES, OCCUPATIONS AND GENERATIONS. </p><p>THIS WAS DONE SUCCESSFULLY, AND SEVERAL YOUNG WOMEN IN THE </p><p>AUDIENCE REMARKED AFTERWARDS THIS WAS ONE OF THE MAIN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02777  02 OF 06  261043Z </p><p>ATTRACTIONS OF THE EVENT.  HOWEVER, REACHING AGREEMENT WAS </p><p>A PAINSTAKING PROCESS.  AS IS THEIR CUSTOM, VIETNAMESE </p><p>OFFICIALS WANTED TO ARRANGE THE PROGRAM AND COMPOSITION OF </p><p>THE PARTICIPANTS WHO WOULD "HOST" MRS. CLINTON, AND MFA </p><p>OFFICIALS STRONGLY INSISTED THAT OTHER PANELISTS BE ADDED </p><p>TO THE EVENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS WAS REVEALING FOR </p><p>WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT OFFICIAL VIETNAM\'S CONCERNS.  FOR ONE </p><p>THING, IT POINTS UP THE EXTREME SENSITIVITY OF THE </p><p>NATIONALISTIC VIETNAMESE TO PRESERVING THE SYMBOLISM OF </p><p>EQUALITY AND MUTUAL RESPECT.  THUS, VIETNAM, AS THE </p><p>OFFICIAL HOST FOR CLINTONS\' VISIT, BELIEVED ITS ROLE WAS TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHAT MRS. CLINTON WANTED TO DO AND THEN TO </p><p>ARRANGE THE REQUISITE EVENTS FOR HER.  IN SIMILAR TERMS, </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE SIDE FELT IT SHOULD PROVIDE THE "OFFICIAL" </p><p>ANSWER TO THE FIRST LADY\'S QUESTIONS AT THE FORUM.  THE </p><p>ARGUMENT OVER THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE ILLUSTRATES THESE </p><p>CONCERNS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE EVENING PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRESIDENT </p><p>AND THE FIRST LADY, THE TWO SIDES CONTINUED NEGOTIATING </p><p>BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FORUM -- WHO THE PARTICIPANTS </p><p>WOULD BE, WHAT QUESTIONS THEY WOULD FOCUS ON, INDEED </p><p>WHETHER THE HOST VIETNAMESE SIDE WOULD ALLOW MRS. CLINTON </p><p>TO HAVE SUCH A FORUM WITH WOMEN OF HER OWN CHOOSING.  THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS BOGGED DOWN OVER THE COMPOSITION OF THE PANEL, </p><p>BUT EVEN MORE SO OVER HOW THE PANELISTS WOULD BE SEATED. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE FIRST LADY\'S ADVANCE STAFF WAS INTENT ON </p><p>LIMITING THE NUMBER OF PANELISTS TO NO MORE THAN SEVEN, </p><p>WHILE THE GVN SIDE PRESSED FOR FURTHER ADDITIONS OF HIGH- </p><p>LEVEL OFFICIALS WHO THEY BELIEVED NEEDED TO BE INCLUDED FOR </p><p>PROTOCOL REASONS.  AFTER FIVE HOURS OF BARGAINING, THE U.S. </p><p>HAD AGREED TO EIGHT PANELISTS PLUS THE HEAD OF THE WOMEN\'S </p><p>UNION TO MAKE WELCOMING REMARKS.  HOWEVER, THE TWO SIDES </p><p>WERE AT AN IMPASSE OVER WHO WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02777  03 OF 06  261044Z </p><p>HIV/AIDS, WITH THE U.S. SIDE PROPOSING ONE RESEARCHER AND </p><p>THE GVN SIDE WANTING THAT PERSON BUT ALSO INSISTING ON </p><p>ADDING ANOTHER MAN.  THE FIRST LADY\'S REPRESENTATIVE WARNED </p><p>THAT HE WAS CLOSE TO CALLING OFF THE EVENT AND INSTEAD </p><p>HAVING THE FIRST LADY CONDUCT A SMALLER PRIVATE FUNCTION </p><p>WITHOUT GVN PARTICIPATION. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) AFTER PROBING THE GVN SIDE ONE LAST TIME FOR </p><p>FLEXIBILITY, IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE GVN WAS NOT </p><p>ATTACHED TO THE SECOND PANELIST; RATHER, WHAT WAS IMPORTANT </p><p>WAS THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS AT THE SEMI-CIRCULAR </p><p>TABLE (COUNTING MRS. CLINTON AND THE MODERATOR) BE AN EVEN </p><p>NUMBER.  THIS WAS SO THAT MRS. CLINTON WOULD NOT BE </p><p>CENTERED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE, BUT THAT MRS. CLINTON </p><p>AND A VIETNAMESE COUNTERPART WOULD BE EQUALLY SPACED TO ONE </p><p>SIDE.  ONE U.S. PARTICIPANT PROPOSED A COMPROMISE WHEREBY </p><p>THE TABLE WOULD BE ARCHED SO THAT MRS. CLINTON AND THE </p><p>LABOR MINISTER BE EQUIDISTANT FROM THE CENTER, WITH FIVE </p><p>PERSONS ARRAYED TO ONE SIDE AND SIX TO THE OTHER.  THE GVN </p><p>NEGOTIATOR EXCUSED HERSELF FOR FIVE MINUTES TO CALL HER </p><p>SUPERIORS ON HER CELL PHONE.  SHE CAME BACK SAYING THAT WAS </p><p>FINE.  (COMMENT: AMAZINGLY, THE GVN SIDE WAS WILLING TO </p><p>RISK CALLING OFF THE FIRST LADY\'S DIALOGUE ON WOMEN\'S </p><p>ISSUES BECAUSE OF THE SYMBOLISM THAT SHE NOT BE CENTERED IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE.  THIS ECHOED THE MONTHS-LONG </p><p>ARGUMENTS OVER THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE IN THE PARIS PEACE </p><p>TALKS DECADES BEFORE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>CONTRAST BETWEEN A CANDID LUNCHEON AND A SCRIPTED FORUM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02777  03 OF 06  261044Z </p><p>12. (C) PERHAPS THE MOST INSTRUCTIVE LESSONS TO COME OUT OF </p><p>THE FORUM WERE ABOUT THE CLASH OF WHAT ONE OF THE PANELISTS </p><p>LATER CALLED THE "TWO CULTURES OF VIETNAM."  THIS PANELIST </p><p>(STRICTLY PROTECT) LATER TOLD US THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY </p><p>DISAPPOINTED BY HOW SHE FELT THE "AGREED PURPOSE" OF THE </p><p>FORUM HAD BEEN UNDERMINED BY HER FELLOW PANELISTS.  SHE WAS </p><p>STRUCK BY THE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT TONE OF THE PUBLIC </p><p>REMARKS MADE BY SOME PANELISTS IN THE FORUM, AND THOSE MADE </p><p>IN PRIVATE AT THE LUNCH HOSTED BY MODERATOR VI PETERSON, A </p><p>TRADE CONSULTANT AND SPOUSE OF THE AMBASSADOR.  (SHE CITED </p><p>IN PARTICULAR THE CONTRASTING REMARKS OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>MEMBER NGO BA THANH AND VUONG THI HANH OF THE CENTER FOR </p><p>EDUCATION PROMOTION AND EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN.)  AT THE </p><p>LUNCH, ATTENDED BY THE FIRST LADY\'S CHIEF OF STAFF MELANNE </p><p>VERVEER AND S/PICW COORDINATOR THERESA LOAR, THE PANELISTS </p><p>HAD GIVEN CANDID ASSESSMENTS IN ENGLISH OF HOW VIETNAMESE </p><p>WOMEN HAD MADE IMPORTANT PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS BUT YET </p><p>MUCH STILL REMAINED TO BE DONE.  (NOTE: THE LABOR MINISTER </p><p>AND VIETNAM WOMEN\'S UNION PRESIDENT DECLINED TO ATTEND THE </p><p>LUNCH.  ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANH WAS THE ONLY GOVERNMENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TO ATTEND.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) AT THIS PRE-FORUM LUNCHEON, WHICH WAS SEEN AS A </p><p>"WARM-UP" FOR THE FORUM ITSELF, ONE OF THE MAJOR THEMES </p><p>BOTH EXPRESSED AND DEMONSTRATED BY THE WOMEN\'S STORIES WAS </p><p>THE CREATIVITY, RESOURCEFULNESS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ENERGY </p><p>OF THESE WOMEN.  MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN TRAILBLAZERS IN </p><p>PRIVATIZING COMPANIES, ORGANIZING RURAL WOMEN TO SPEAK UP </p><p>FOR THEIR RIGHTS, AND PRESSING FOR ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS </p><p>GUARANTEEING WOMEN EQUAL RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW.  OUR </p><p>PANELIST SOURCE SAID SHE LEFT THE LUNCHEON FEELING SHE </p><p>WOULD BE PARTICIPATING IN SOMETHING TRULY HISTORIC IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  (COMMENT: THIS WAS EXACTLY THE SENTIMENT OF THE </p><p>FORUM ORGANIZERS.  IN RETROSPECT, IT SEEMS THAT THE GVN\'S </p><p>TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE PARTICIPANTS WERE FOLLOWED UP </p><p>BY "SCRIPTING" A NUMBER OF THE PARTICIPANTS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02777  04 OF 06  261044Z </p><p>14. (C) THE PANELIST TOLD EMBOFF THE CONTRAST WAS DRAMATIC </p><p>AND IMMEDIATELY FELT.  AFTER FINISHING THE LUNCHEON, ON THE </p><p>WALK TO THE FORUM ITSELF, SHE WAS TOLD BY A SENIOR FELLOW </p><p>PANELIST THAT ALL THEIR PRESENTATIONS SHOULD BE IN </p><p>VIETNAMESE.  "THIS IS AN ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY," THE SENIOR </p><p>VIETNAMESE TOLD HER, IMPLYING THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY SPEAK </p><p>VIETNAMESE IN A PUBLIC EVENT IN THEIR COUNTRY.  THE </p><p>PANELIST WHO SPOKE WITH US DISAGREED, FEELING THEY WOULD </p><p>HAVE A MORE CANDID INTERACTION WITH MRS. CLINTON IF THEY </p><p>SPOKE IN ENGLISH, BUT SHE WAS PRECEDED BY OTHERS WHO SPOKE </p><p>FIRST IN VIETNAMESE. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) FURTHERMORE, IN CONTRAST TO THEIR REMARKS IN </p><p>PRIVATE, SEVERAL OF THE FORUM PARTICIPANTS REVERTED TO </p><p>SLOGANEERING, PRAISING THE "CENTRAL ROLE" OF THE CPV IN </p><p>LEADING THE CAMPAIGN FOR WOMEN\'S EQUALITY.  THE INITIAL </p><p>PRESENTATIONS -- BY WOMEN\'S UNION PRESIDENT KHIET AND LABOR </p><p>MINISTER HANG, WHO AS CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE THE </p><p>HIGHEST-RANKING CPV MEMBERS ATTENDING -- INCLUDED </p><p>PREDICTABLE NODS TO THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY, BUT WERE NOT OVERLY IDEOLOGICAL.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>FOLLOWING THREE PRESENTERS, ONE AFTER ANOTHER, LAUNCHED </p><p>INTO EXTENSIVE REMARKS THAT CONTRASTED DRAMATICALLY WITH </p><p>THEIR PRIVATE REMARKS AT THE LUNCHEON. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) NGO BA THANH, NOT A MEMBER OF THE CPV AND IN MANY </p><p>SETTINGS FIERCELY INDEPENDENT AND KNOWN AS A CRUSADER FOR </p><p>WOMEN\'S RIGHTS, DISCOURSED AT LENGTH ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF </p><p>THE CPV IN THIS REGARD, AT ONE POINT SAYING THAT EQUITY HAD </p><p>BEEN ACHIEVED AND ENSHRINED IN FOUNDING CPV DOCUMENTS IN </p><p>1945.  LIKEWISE, BOTH PHAM CHI LAN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02777  04 OF 06  261044Z </p><p>VIETNAMESE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, AND VUONG THI </p><p>HANH REMARKED ON THE "PROMINENT ROLE" OF THE CPV IN </p><p>ADVANCING WOMEN\'S RIGHTS "UNDER THE REVOLUTION."  THE </p><p>PANELIST WHO SPOKE WITH US SAID SHE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE </p><p>THAT THANH, LAN AND HANH HAD TEXTS STAMPED "OFFICIALLY </p><p>APPROVED" SIGNIFYING THAT THEY HAD BEEN VETTED BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES.  SINCE THESE PANELISTS WERE NOT </p><p>REPRESENTING GOVERNMENT OFFICES, SHE FOUND THIS TO BE </p><p>TELLING.  (NOTE: THANH IS A SELF-DESCRIBED "INDEPENDENT" </p><p>MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY, LAN IS A LEADER OF THE QUASI- </p><p>OFFICIAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND HANH HEADS UP AN </p><p>INDIGENOUS NGO.) (COMMENT: AT ONE LEVEL, IT IS NOT </p><p>SURPRISING THE GVN AUTHORITIES WOULD SEEK TO INFLUENCE SUCH </p><p>A HIGH-PROFILE FORUM AS THIS ONE.  BUT WE WERE STRUCK BY </p><p>THE SHARP CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT FORUM PARTICIPANTS SAID IN </p><p>PRIVATE AND WHAT THEY SAID IN A PUBLIC SETTING UNDER THE </p><p>WATCHFUL EYES OF SENIOR CPV OFFICIALS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: BEHIND THE SCENES: PORTRAITS OF THE "TWO VIETNAMS" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE PUBLIC SPEECHES BY SEVERAL </p><p>PANELISTS AND THEIR CANDID PRIVATE REMARKS HIGHLIGHTS THE </p><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPETING VIEWS OF THE "TWO </p><p>VIETNAMS" -- ONE OFFICIAL, FORMAL AND INSISTENT ON </p><p>CENTRALIZED CONTROL; THE OTHER INFORMAL, OPEN TO CANDID </p><p>DIALOGUE AND INCREASED DEALINGS WITH THE U.S.  THE FORMER </p><p>VIEW IS CAUTIOUS, PATERNALISTIC, XENOPHOBIC AND HIGHLY </p><p>SUSPICIOUS OF WESTERN INTENTIONS.  THIS IS THE DOMINANT </p><p>VIEW AMONG CPV HARDLINERS AND WAR VETERANS, AND THROUGH </p><p>THEM, THE SECURITY MINISTRIES OF THE GOVERNMENT, ELEMENTS </p><p>OF THE PARTY\'S MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND THE STATE ORGANS THAT </p><p>ENFORCE STATE CENSORSHIP OF THE PRESS AND OTHER PUBLIC </p><p>SPEECH. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) BY CONTRAST, THE OTHER VIEW IS MORE OPEN, ENGAGING, </p><p>ENTREPRENEURIAL AND EAGER TO HAVE VIETNAM INTEGRATE MORE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02777  05 OF 06  261044Z </p><p>FULLY WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD.  IN THIS CAMP, WE </p><p>BELIEVE, ARE THE VAST MAJORITY OF VIETNAM\'S YOUNGER </p><p>POPULATION, WHO HUNGER FOR THE PROMISES OF BETTER JOBS AND </p><p>A BETTER LIFE, INCLUDING NOT ONLY MATERIAL WELL-BEING, BUT </p><p>ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE GREATER CONTROL OVER THEIR </p><p>DESTINIES.  THIS CAMP FINDS SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT AMONG </p><p>TECHNOCRATS AND MANY YOUNGER OFFICIALS IN THE CPV AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, AS ONE OF THE PANELISTS POINTED OUT </p><p>TO US, WORKING IN THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT TODAY REQUIRES </p><p>AT LEAST TACIT DEFERENCE TO THE DOMINANT OFFICIAL CULTURE </p><p>OF CENTRALIZED CONTROL AND, FOR SOME POSITIONS, PARTY </p><p>AFFILIATION AND MEMBERSHIP ARE REQUIRED.  THE MORE </p><p>ENTREPRENEURIAL CAMP FOCUSES ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE </p><p>FUTURE, WHILE THE OTHER CAMP LOOKS LARGELY TO THE PAST, </p><p>RECYCLING OLD-FASHIONED IDEOLOGY TO WHICH VIRTUALLY NO ONE </p><p>SUBSCRIBES TODAY.  DURING THE VISIT, THE MESSAGES OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY WERE FOCUSED ON REACHING OUT </p><p>TO THIS YOUNGER GENERATION.  THE EFFUSIVE POPULAR REACTION </p><p>THEY RECEIVED REVEALS THE RESONANCE OF THEIR MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) THE DIFFERENT CULTURES OF THE "TWO VIETNAMS" ARE </p><p>STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY GENERATIONAL AND REGIONAL FACTORS, </p><p>AS WELL AS CPV MEMBERSHIP, THOUGH THESE MATTERS ARE NOT </p><p>DETERMINATIVE.  AS A RULE, YOUNGER AND SOUTHERN VIETNAMESE </p><p>ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FIT THE MORE OPEN, CANDID PARADIGM. </p><p>UNDER THE CPV UMBRELLA THERE ARE PERSONS IN BOTH CAMPS; </p><p>SOME PERSONS, FOR INSTANCE, JOIN THE CPV FOR PRAGMATIC </p><p>RATHER THAN IDEOLOGICAL REASONS, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR ADVANCEMENT.  FOR EXAMPLE, PANELIST NGUYEN </p><p>THI MAI THANH, GENERAL DIRECTOR OF THE REE REFRIGERATION </p><p>COMPANY, IS A CPV MEMBER IN HER LATE 40S, AND SHE CLEARLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02777  05 OF 06  261044Z </p><p>IS IN THE REFORMIST CAMP.  SHE LARGELY ESCHEWED IDEOLOGY IN </p><p>HER FORUM PRESENTATION AND FOCUSED ON THE INCREASED </p><p>BUSINESS BENEFITS TO BE DERIVED FROM PRIVATIZATION AND </p><p>GREATER TRANSPARENCY.  IN A MEETING WITH POLOFF AFTER THE </p><p>FORUM, SHE SAID SHE HOPED THE UPCOMING CPV PARTY CONGRESS </p><p>WOULD PRESS FOR GREATER OPENNESS AND DEBATE, AND WOULD </p><p>EMBRACE A PROGRAM OF GREATER ENGAGEMENT WITH THE U.S. AND </p><p>THE REST OF THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) THE PANELIST WE DEBRIEFED AFTERWARDS JOKED THAT HER </p><p>FRIENDS WERE SAYING "EVEN THE AMERICANS" COULDN\'T PULL OFF </p><p>A CANDID PUBLIC FORUM OF VIETNAMESE WOMEN.  SHE ASSESSED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE FORUM HAD PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN </p><p>HIGHLIGHTING IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CONCERN TO VIETNAMESE </p><p>WOMEN, AND SHE EXPRESSED STRONG INTEREST IN HOLDING A </p><p>FOLLOW-UP SESSION TO DISCUSS MANY OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN </p><p>THE FORUM, INCLUDING EXPLORING LINKS TO MRS. CLINTON\'S </p><p>"VITAL VOICES" NETWORK OF WOMEN LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD. </p><p>(NOTE: IN STRATEGIZING WITH THIS PANELIST AND OTHERS HERE </p><p>ABOUT A FOLLOW-UP PUBLIC AFFAIRS PROGRAM, THERE ARE SEVERAL </p><p>CLEAR "LESSONS LEARNED" TO ENABLE THE VOICES OF THE NEW, </p><p>MORE OPEN VIETNAM TO BE HEARD.  WE WILL HOLD THE DISCUSSION </p><p>IN ENGLISH, INVITE YOUNGER PARTICIPANTS TO SPEAK FIRST, </p><p>ENCOURAGE QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE, AND NOT ALLOW THE </p><p>CPV "ELDERS" TO CONTROL THE DISCUSSION.  THE TRADEOFF MAY </p><p>BE THAT "OFFICIAL VIETNAM" WILL NOT AGREE TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>UNDER SUCH GROUND RULES.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUDING COMMENT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) OUR EXPERIENCE HELPING ORGANIZE THE FIRST LADY\'S </p><p>WOMEN\'S FORUM POINTED UP SOME OF THE SHARP CONTRASTS </p><p>BETWEEN THE "TWO VIETNAMS" -- AND THE LONG SHADOW THAT THE </p><p>OFFICIAL CULTURE OF CENTRALIZED CONTROL CASTS OVER THE </p><p>BROADER SOCIETY\'S CULTURE OF ENTREPRENEURISM.  AS SHOWCASED </p><p>IN THIS FORUM, OFFICIAL VIETNAM\'S IMPERATIVE TO SCRIPT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02777  06 OF 06  261045Z </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION SIGNIFICANTLY HOLDS BACK VIETNAM\'S MORE </p><p>DYNAMIC LEADERS.  THE EXTENSIVE MANEUVERING OF </p><p>PARTY/GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS BEHIND THE SCENES REVEALS THE </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY EXTENT OF CONTROL EXERCISED BY THE </p><p>PATERNALISTIC, TOP-DOWN DECISION-MAKERS OF OFFICIAL </p><p>VIETNAM.  IN "MANAGING" THE REACTION AND PUBLICITY OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S TRIP, THIS GROUP SOUGHT TO LIMIT ACCESS AND TO </p><p>SCRIPT RESPONSES.  AS REPORTED REF B, WHAT THE </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY POPULAR RECEPTION GIVEN TO THE PRESIDENT </p><p>REVEALS IS HOW MUCH OUT OF TOUCH THIS GROUP IS WITH THE </p><p>FEELINGS OF THE VIETNAMESE PUBLIC AT LARGE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
