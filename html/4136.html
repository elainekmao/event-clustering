THIS IS DUE IN PART TO THE EXPANDING </p><p>PRRO PORTFOLIO, NOW NUMBERED AT 36 OPERATIONS WORLD-WIDE, </p><p>AND IS A RESULT OF DRAMATICALLY INCREASED RELIEF NEEDS IN </p><p>SELECTED OPERATIONS SUCH AS ANGOLA, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE </p><p>2002 PEACE ACCORD.

HE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED WFP IN HIS OCTOBER 23 PROCLAMATION </p><p>FOR UNITED NATIONS DAY, LAUDING WFP FOR "HELPING TO AVERT A </p><p>SEVERE FAMINE THAT THREATENED AFGHANISTAN." </p><p> </p><p>8. HALL CONFIRMED THAT USAID HAD AGREED TO PROVIDE USD 200 </p><p>MILLION TO WFP FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF THE TWENTIETH BIENNIUM </p><p>PLEDGE PERIOD (2003-2004).  THIS REPRESENTS A 23 PERCENT </p><p>INCREASE TO USAID\'S ANNUAL PLEDGE AMOUNT, AND INCLUDES A </p><p>DOUBLING OF USAID\'S CASH CONTRIBUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>COSTS.  HE REMINDED THAT THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS A FLOOR FOR </p><p>USAID SUPPORT, NOT A CEILING. </p><p> </p><p>9. HALL ALSO HIGHLIGHTED USAID\'S DECISION TO INITIALLY </p><p>PROVIDE 100,000 METRIC TONS OF WHEAT - WITH A VALUE OF USD </p><p>40 MILLION DOLLARS - FOR THE LOOMING CRISIS IN ETHIOPIA, </p><p>WHILE REMINDING THAT THE NEEDS OF THE ENTIRE HORN OF AFRICA </p><p>REGION ARE LIKELY TO BE FAR GREATER.
