REASONS: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) AFTER ONLY FOUR MEETINGS, ZIMBABWE\'S CABINET </p><p>APPEARS TO BE SPLIT BETWEEN FACTIONS:  ONE LED BY </p><p>INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO AND THE </p><p>OTHER LED BY FINANCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MINISTER </p><p>SIMBA MAKONI AND INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE </p><p>MINISTER NKOSANA MOYO.  THESE LATTER INDIVIDUALS HAVE </p><p>EMERGED AS THE CABINET\'S MORE MODERATE, OBJECTIVE AND </p><p>PERHAPS MORE INTELLECTUAL OR AT LEAST PRAGMATIC LEADERS, </p><p>WHILE ITS OTHER MEMBERS HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED THE SAME </p><p>ABILITY TO TAKE STOCK OF THE FUTURE OR ARTICULATE </p><p>POSITIONS.  JONATHAN MOYO LEADS THE ANTI-WEST GROUP WHO </p><p>ARE PROPONENTS OF THE ACCELERATED LAND REFORM PROGRAM, </p><p>THE DONORS AND CONSEQUENCES BE DAMNED.  IN THAT GROUP WE </p><p>WOULD PLACE FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS MUDENGE, AND </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL HOUSING </p><p>MINISTER IGNATIUS CHOMBO, WHO IS ALSO THE LEADER OF THE </p><p>INTER-MINISTERIAL GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE </p><p>FAST TRACK LAND RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE.  THE OTHER </p><p>FACTION IS WHAT ONE MIGHT LOOSELY TERM THE PRAGMATISTS, </p><p>WHO WANT TO TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND AND WOULD BE WILLING </p><p>TO COMPROMISE WITH THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE ON CERTAIN ISSUES OF NATIONAL </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE.  WHILE IN THE MINORITY, WE WOULD PLACE IN </p><p>THE GROUP HIGHER EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY MINISTER </p><p>HERBERT MURERWA. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04492  01 OF 02  151652Z </p><p>2.  (C)  OF GREATER INTEREST TO US IS HOW THE MAKONI </p><p>SCHOOL OF THOUGHT WILL FARE.  AT THIS EARLY STAGE, </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE APPEARS TO HAVE ALLOWED THE CABINET </p><p>RIFT TO EMERGE, WHILE GIVING NO OVERT SIGN WITH RESPECT </p><p>TO WHICH SIDE HE ALIGNS HIMSELF.  HE SEEMS HAPPY TO PLAY </p><p>THE ONE OFF AGAINST THE OTHER, IN THE TRADITION OF AN </p><p>AFRICAN CHIEF.  MAKONI, FOR HIS PART, IS ALSO MOVING </p><p>QUICKLY.  ZIMBABWE\'S MINISTRIES ARE ALREADY FEELING HIS </p><p>REDUCED AND PENNY PINCHING DISBURSEMENTS.  THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER IS OVERWHELMING THE CABINET WITH THE NUMBER OF </p><p>PROPOSALS HE PUTS TO IT EVERY SESSION.  AT THE AUGUST 15 </p><p>MEETING, MAKONI WAS SCHEDULED TO PRESENT A NUMBER OF </p><p>PROPOSALS FOR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING EXPENDITURES BY </p><p>MINISTERS ON PERKS.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS WILL BE MET WITH </p><p>SOME RESISTANCE.  ADDITIONALLY, HE IS ALSO SAID TO BE </p><p>LOOKING FOR AN ENTRY POINT ON THE LAND QUESTION TO WREST </p><p>ITS OWNERSHIP AWAY FROM THE HARDLINERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  MUGABE, AT LEAST INITIALLY, SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN </p><p>MAKONI SOME LEASH TO PROPOSE PROGRAMS TO REVERSE </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC SLIDE.  RUMORS CONTINUE TO MULTIPLY </p><p>THAT MUGABE WILL ELEVATE HIS FINANCE MINISTER TO THE </p><p>POLITBURO.  THE PRESIDENT IS PLAYING AN IMPORTANT CARD </p><p>BY INCREASING THE AUTHORITY AND CLOUT OF THIS APPEALING </p><p>AND CAPABLE CABINET MEMBER.  AGAINST WHOM AND FOR WHAT </p><p>REASON REMAINS UNCLEAR, BUT IN SO DOING, HE WILL </p><p>EVENTUALLY CONSOLIDATE HIS CONTROL OVER HIS FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER.  AMONG POSSIBLE SCENARIOS, MUGABE MAY BE </p><p>CONSIDERING MAKONI AS HIS SUCCESSOR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT REMAINS AN ENIGMATIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04492  01 OF 02  151652Z </p><p>IF NOT MERCURIAL FIGURE.  HE HAS NOT LOST HIS EDGE AS A </p><p>STRATEGIC THINKER AND IS PROMOTING MAKONI FOR A REASON, </p><p>PROBABLY AS A TRUMP CARD TO ENSURE THAT ZANU-PF WINS THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY IN 2002.  MUGABE WOULD NEED THAT OUTCOME FOR </p><p>HIS OWN PROTECTION, IF HE CHOOSES NOT TO RUN.  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, THE PRESIDENT REMAINS CONSISTENT: HE </p><p>CONTINUES TO HAVE NEAR TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE ECONOMY. </p><p>HIS DISCOURSE FOLLOWS A POLITICAL/MILITARY LOGIC, AND IN </p><p>HIS MIND, IT IS CORRECT FOR WHAT HE WANTS: POWER AND THE </p><p>ASSETS OF THE WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMING COMMUNITY.  THAT </p><p>THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE SOUNDS </p><p>MONSTROUS IN LIGHT OF THE POPULAR FRUSTRATION WITH THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC DOWNFALL IS OF LITTLE CONCERN TO HIM. </p><p>HE DOES UNDERSTAND POLITICAL ECONOMY: A ZANU-PF </p><p>ELECTORAL VICTORY IN 2002 WOULD BE CLINCHED IF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY WERE TO START EXHIBITING SIGNS OF A </p><p>POSITIVE GROWTH RATE SOMETIME LATER THIS YEAR AND INTO </p><p>NEXT.  THAT WOULD BE AN ASTOUNDING PERFORMANCE FOR SIMBA </p><p>MAKONI, POSSIBLE IF THE PRESIDENT WERE TO STOP TALKING </p><p>AND ABANDON HIS CURRENT TACK ON LAND REFORM.  HAVE WE </p><p>SEEN ANY SIGNS OF THIS?  NO.  IS IT POSSIBLE?  WE DOUBT </p><p>IT.  WHILE WE WISH MAKONI WELL, AND HAVE HIGH REGARD FOR </p><p>HIM, HIS EFFORTS MAY AMOUNT TO TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE, AND </p><p>HE MAY NOT LAST LONG.  IN FACT, THE FAILURE OF SUCH AN </p><p>INDIVIDUAL WOULD, WITHOUT DOUBT, BE POINTED TO BY MUGABE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2489 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04492  02 OF 02  151652Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------7A1E41  151652Z /38 </p><p>P 151650Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6845 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 004492 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/14/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  WINDOW DRESSING OR REFORM?
