<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000023 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (U) DEPUTY SPEAKER ON POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 0015 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  In a January 5 meeting Deputy Speaker </p><p>Meshari al-Anjari gave his readout on recent developments in </p><p>Kuwait,s National Assembly, the status of a possible </p><p>"grilling" of a Minister charged with corruption, and his </p><p>version of a military timeline for Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloffs and Pol FSN met with Kuwaiti National Assembly </p><p>Deputy Speaker Meshari al-Anjari on January 5, after a long </p><p>holiday weekend during which local media had reported that MP </p><p>Abdulla al-Naibari was preparing to subject one of two </p><p>government ministers to parliamentary "grilling" for their </p><p>role in a suspect land development deal, in which 64 square </p><p>kilometers of public land were sold at rock-bottom prices to </p><p>one developer, without a bidding process. </p><p> </p><p>Whom to grill? </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) To explain confusing news reports that either the </p><p>Minister of Finance, Dr. Yousef al-Ibrahim, or Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister and Minister of State for National Assembly Affairs </p><p>Mohammad Dheifallah Sharar would be grilled, al-Anjari said </p><p>that MP al-Naibari had three choices:  he could grill the </p><p>Prime Minister and Crown Prince, Shaykh Saad al-Abdullah </p><p>al-Sabah who was ultimately responsible for the deal, but not </p><p>of sound health (Grilling the Crown Prince is a nonstarter </p><p>given the CP,s extremely poor physical and mental health, </p><p>and Kuwaiti society,s veneration of him), he could grill </p><p>Minister al-Ibrahim, who signed the contract, or he could </p><p>grill Minister Sharar.  MP al-Naibari had not yet formally </p><p>submitted his grilling request, but al-Anjari said it </p><p>appeared the grilling would be directed towards Sharar. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Al-Anjari hoped the matter would be dealt with </p><p>shortly, because it will not go away.  He said the last 6 </p><p>months of every National Assembly session were "stormy," and </p><p>this would be a good time for the government to resolve the </p><p>issue, leaving a clean slate for the new assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Elections </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The National Assembly\'s term expires in mid-July. </p><p>Al-Anjari said the Council of Ministers had asked the </p><p>Constitutional Court to confirm whether elections can be held </p><p>anytime during the last two months of the term.  If so, the </p><p>government would want the date to be in early June; otherwise </p><p>it would be in July.  "We hope for June," he added. </p><p>(Comment:  While seemingly insignificant, a June vs. July </p><p>election could considerably impact voter turnout.  By July, </p><p>many Kuwaitis have left for cooler and more comfortable </p><p>climes, giving the remaining voters more weight.  Liberals </p><p>are seen as more likely to leave Kuwait than Islamists or </p><p>Tribalists.  End Comment. ) </p><p> </p><p>Fewer Islamists after Elections </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Al-Anjari, a liberal, predicted the new assembly would </p><p>include fewer Islamists, owing to a number of factors. </p><p>First, he said, Kuwaiti sympathy for America had increased </p><p>since 9/11/01.  Second, Kuwaitis recall that during the Iraqi </p><p>occupation, some Islamists (specifically, The Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood) had opposed relying on the U.S., preferring to </p><p>pin their hopes on "muslim armies."  Third, the fact that </p><p>Islamists had met with Saddam since 9/11 had not endeared </p><p>them to the general population.  Finally, he said, Islamists </p><p>had not presented any significant legislative plan to the </p><p>Assembly, but had spent much of their time on "grillings," </p><p>notably that of Minister al-Ibrahim, which took place in July </p><p>of 2002. </p><p> </p><p>What about Iraq? </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Moving to the subject of the hour, the possibility of </p><p>conflict with Saddam, al-Anjari asked if the US could prove </p><p>that Saddam had WMD.  PolChief responded that this would be </p><p>the story of the next few weeks. Besides, any serious </p><p>government knows Saddam is lying when he denies having any </p><p>WMD.  Al-Anjari agreed, saying that Kuwaitis know Saddam is a </p><p>liar, because he also denied the existence of Kuwaiti POW\'s. </p><p>It is "easier to hide WMD than POW\'s," he said.  "We hope you </p><p>can prove this to the world," he added. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Al-Anjari also gave his version of how the Iraqi </p><p>situation will play out.  "President Bush has decided Saddam </p><p>should disarm, which means war," he said.  On January 27, </p><p>Hans Blix will give his initial report. On January 28, Israel </p><p>will hold elections.  The Hajj will occur the second week of </p><p>February, then the moon will be full, "so you will not attack </p><p>then."  February 26 was the date of the Gulf War ceasefire, </p><p>and that is when the U.S. will attack, to underscore that the </p><p>reason is Saddam\'s violation of the ceasefire conditions. </p><p> </p><p>Post-Saddam Concerns </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In talking about Iraq, Al-Anjari stressed that </p><p>Kuwaitis were not concerned so much about a possible </p><p>conflict, as the &day after.8  PolChief assured him that </p><p>the USG was working with the international community to </p><p>ensure that the transition to a post-Saddam Iraq was peaceful </p><p>and that Iraq maintains its territorial integrity.  Al-Anjari </p><p>reminded that Kuwait was still interested in ensuring it </p><p>received war reparation payments. "Don,t forget about </p><p>compensation," he said.  "The passage of years should not </p><p>equal forgiveness."  That said, if principles were </p><p>maintained, Kuwait would take steps to help the people of </p><p>Iraq. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
