<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000618 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/01/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, MOPS, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE SECURITY MINISTER COMMENTS ON DRC </p><p>SITUATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES EARL M. IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>NICHOLAS GOCHE TOLD CHARGE FEBRUARY 1 THAT ZIMBABWE IS </p><p>COMMITTED TO THE LUSAKA PEACE PROCESS AND URGED THE US </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00618  01 OF 02  011309Z </p><p>TO CONTINUE PLAYING A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN RESOLVING THE </p><p>DRC WAR.  ZIMBABWE WANTS TO GIVE NEW DRC PRESIDENT </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA TIME TO STABILIZE THE SITUATION IN </p><p>KINSHASA, ACCORDING TO GOCHE.  ZIMBABWE DOES NOT KNOW </p><p>WHETHER KABILA IS A TEMPORARY FIGURE OR NOT, AND IT DOES </p><p>NOT REALLY KNOW WHO IS CALLING THE SHOTS IN KINSHASA, </p><p>GOCHE ADMITTED.  GOCHE\'S REMARKS REINFORCED OUR </p><p>ASSESSMENT THAT ZIMBABWE IS BIDING ITS TIME IN THE DRC </p><p>UNTIL IT CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT, IF </p><p>ANYTHING, IT CAN DO ABOUT IT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) ON FEBRUARY 1, CHARGE, ACCOMPANIED BY ROAL CHIEF </p><p>AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER), CALLED ON MINISTER OF STATE FOR </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY NICHOLAS GOCHE, WHO IS ONE OF THE KEY </p><p>FIGURES DIRECTING ZIMBABWE\'S EFFORT IN THE DRC.  GOCHE </p><p>NOTED THAT HE HAS MOSTLY RECOVERED FROM SERIOUS INJURIES </p><p>SUSTAINED IN A CAR ACCIDENT IN OCTOBER, BUT WAS STILL </p><p>EXPERIENCING SOME PAIN AND DISCOMFORT WITH HIS LEFT LEG. </p><p>HE SAID HIS INJURIES HAD NOT REQUIRED SURGERY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CHARGE ASKED GOCHE FOR HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE DRC </p><p>SITUATION FOLLOWING LAURENT KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION AND </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S NEXT STEPS.  GOCHE STATED THAT THE DRC ALLIES </p><p>ARE COMMITTED TO PEACE AND THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  LUSAKA </p><p>IS THE ONLY FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH ZIMBABWE AND THE OTHER </p><p>PLAYERS CAN WITHDRAW THEIR FORCES.  ZIMBABWE WANTS A </p><p>ROLE IN THE NEW DISPENSATION IN KINSHASA TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>ITS GOALS FOR PEACE ARE REALIZED, GOCHE CONTINUED, BUT </p><p>IT CANNOT ACT ALONE.  IT NEEDS THE OTHER PLAYERS.  GOCHE </p><p>EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT UGANDA DOES NOT SHARE THE </p><p>ALLIES\' DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND THAT IT IS MORE INTERESTED </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00618  01 OF 02  011309Z </p><p>IN OVERTHROWING THE KABILA GOVERNMENT.  THE MINISTER </p><p>MENTIONED THAT RWANDAN PRESIDENT KAGAME HAD ATTEMPTED TO </p><p>CONTACT PRESIDENT MUGABE, BUT HE DID NOT KNOW IF THAT </p><p>CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN PLACE YET.  AS FOR THE NON-STATE </p><p>ACTORS SUCH AS THE INTERAHAMWE, THE MINISTER STATED THAT </p><p>THEY NEED TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION, BUT THAT THEY </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE A HINDRANCE TO THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ZIMBABWE WANTS TO GIVE KABILA TIME TO STABILIZE </p><p>THE SITUATION IN KINSHASA, THE MINISTER PROFESSED.  IT </p><p>WANTS KABILA TO FIRMLY ESTABLISH HIS AUTHORITY SO THAT </p><p>WHATEVER AGREEMENT HE REACHES WITH HIS OPPONENTS WILL </p><p>LAST.  BUT ZIMBABWE DOES WANT HIM TO NEGOTIATE WITH BOTH </p><p>HIS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FOES.  GOCHE BELIEVES THAT </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA IS MORE FLEXIBLE THAN HIS FATHER WAS. </p><p>DESPITE THIS, THE GOZ DOES NOT KNOW IF KABILA WILL BE A </p><p>TEMPORARY FIGURE OR NOT--THE DUST HAS NOT QUITE SETTLED </p><p>FROM HIS FATHER\'S KILLING.  GOCHE QUICKLY CORRECTED </p><p>HIMSELF AND SAID THAT AGREEMENTS INTO WHICH THE NEW </p><p>CONGOLESE PRESIDENT ENTERED WOULD BE HONORED.  KABILA </p><p>NEEDS MORE FRIENDS THAN HIS FATHER HAD, AND IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO BE MORE OPEN AND TO ARTICULATE HIS </p><p>POLICIES MORE CLEARLY, THE SECURITY MINISTER OFFERED. </p><p>WHEN ASKED IF THE ANGOLANS WERE CALLING THE SHOTS IN </p><p>KINSHASA, GOCHE SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK THEY WERE, </p><p>BUT HE DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHO WAS CALLING THE SHOTS, </p><p>BUT IT SHOULD BE THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) GOCHE NOTED THAT IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT KABILA </p><p>FELT SECURE ENOUGH TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES SO SOON </p><p>AFTER HIS INAUGURATION.  ZIMBABWE IS "HAPPY" THAT KABILA </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00618  01 OF 02  011309Z </p><p>IS VISITING WASHINGTON, AND GOCHE URGED THE U.S. TO </p><p>CONTINUE PLAYING A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN RESOLVING THE </p><p>DRC CRISIS.  THE DRC WILL ALSO NEED A HUGE AMOUNT OF AID </p><p>TO REBUILD, AND GOCHE ENCOURAGED THE U.S. TO CONTRIBUTE </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY TO THIS EFFORT.  HE BELIEVES IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT THAT THE U.S. REMAIN "UNBIASED" IN ITS </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE DRC PLAYERS.  FURTHERMORE, THE U.S. </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE RELUCTANT TO PERSUADE THE UN TO FULLY </p><p>DEPLOY MONUC.  WHEN ASKED IF ALLIED FORCES WERE </p><p>REGROUPING NEAR PWETO, GOCHE STATED THAT IT WAS NOT </p><p>TRUE, AND THAT IF THE ALLIES HAD WANTED TO RETAKE PWETO, </p><p>THEY WOULD HAVE DONE SO WITH EASE BY NOW. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: DESPITE HIS POSITION AS ONE OF THE KEY </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN FIGURES ON DRC POLICY, MINISTER GOCHE WAS NOT </p><p>PARTICULARLY FORTHCOMING AND STUCK TO THE STANDARD GOZ </p><p>LINE ON THE DRC.  HIS COMMENTS REINFORCE OUR ASSESSMENT </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE IS STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE INTERNAL </p><p>DRC POLITICAL SITUATION AND WHETHER OR NOT IT CAN STILL </p><p>INFLUENCE EVENTS IN KINSHASA.  GOCHE\'S ATYPICALLY STRONG </p><p>URGING OF GREATER U.S. INVOLVEMENT SIGNALS TO US THAT </p><p>THE GOZ IS MORE KEEN THAN EVER FOR A RESOLUTION THAT </p><p>WOULD PERMIT IT TO BRING BACK THE BULK OF ITS DRC FORCES </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET        PTQ9449 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00618  02 OF 02  011309Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   MFA-01   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  PM-00    SSO-00   SS-00    PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------BEFE33  011309Z /38 </p><p>O 011307Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8162 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LIBREVILLE </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000618 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/01/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, MOPS, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE SECURITY MINISTER COMMENTS ON DRC </p><p>SITUATION </p><p> </p><p>BEFORE THE EARLY 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
