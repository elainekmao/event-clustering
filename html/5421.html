"Flights of fancy?  We hope not" </p><p> </p><p>Independent English daily, Daily Mirror, commented (1/31): </p><p>"The key phrase is `where it began\'.  Yes, it all began in </p><p>the United States, a country responsible for the mayhem </p><p>that the world is in today and the coming cataclysm. </p><p> </p><p>"It is the United States lopsided policy that is denying a </p><p>peaceful solution to the Palestinian crisis ... denying </p><p>hundreds of millions of the world poor access to cheap and </p><p>quality medicine ... has dealt a death blow to the Kyoto </p><p>protocol on environment ... made the world criminal court </p><p>ineffective ... made the United Nations a puppet or a </p><p>talking shop ... brought the world to the verge of a third </p><p>world war.  The list is longer, with human rights, </p><p>international law, exploitation of the developing world in </p><p>the name of globalisation and other key areas being </p><p>included. </p><p> </p><p>"All this points to one thing -- the United States is </p><p>responsible for the world disorder.  Hence, it all began </p><p>`here in our country\'.  Naturally, Bush did not see it in </p><p>this light in his State of the Union address." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.

This war </p><p>is going to put an end to everything and President Bush </p><p>says it cannot be averted. </p><p> </p><p>"Bush has roused Americans, citing a connection between </p><p>Saddam\'s people and Al-Qaida rebels who attacked America, </p><p>the policeman of the world, on September 11.  He has also </p><p>said that proof is available and will be submitted at an </p><p>appropriate time. </p><p> </p><p>"If war breaks out it will be a serious threat to our </p><p>workers in the Middle East.  We will be unable to expect </p><p>any employment in the region for well over a year.  The </p><p>price of petroleum products will increase, and food will </p><p>once again become scarce.  All of this will be a further </p><p>burden on our people who at present are paying through </p><p>their noses for their vegetables." </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
