<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 KHARTOUM 06366 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR YOUNG; PARIS FOR MORAN </p><p>E.O. 12356; DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KISL, PTER, SU </p><p>SUBJECT: SUDANESE MISCHIEF-MAKING: DOES IT MATTER? </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) DUSHANBE 2573 (NOTAL); B) NOUAKCHOTT 3541 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SECRET/NOFORN ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY. THE GOS/NIF IS INDOCTRINATING ITS PEOPLE </p><p>IN ITS RADICAL, ANTI-WESTERN VERSION OF ISLAM.  IT </p><p>PROMOTES ITS IDEOLOGY ABROAD BY TRAINING AND HELPING </p><p>FOREIGN ISLAMISTS AND BY PROSELYTIZING THROUGH </p><p>ISLAMIST NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOS/NIP </p><p>ALSO SEEKS TO EXPORT POLITICAL CHANGE BY FORCE, AS </p><p>EVIDENCED BY ITS EFFORTS TO DESTABILIZE ERITREA AND </p><p>UGANDA.  MOREOVER, THE GOS/NIF SUPPORTS MOST MAJOR </p><p>MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE IMPORT OF THESE ACTIVITIES SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>OVERSTATED: TERRORISTS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE, </p><p>STABILITY IN THE HORN OF AFRICA WILL REMAIN </p><p>PRECARIOUS, AND RADICAL ISLAMISTS WORLDWIDE WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE U.S. WITH OR WITHOUT SUDAN\'S </p><p>HELP.  GOS/NIF BEHAVIOR, HOWEVER, MAKES THINGS WORSE </p><p>ON ALL THREE SCORES.  ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN </p><p>THE WORLD, SUDAN NONETHELESS SUCCEEDS IN PROJECTING </p><p>INFLUENCE ABROAD; UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS UNIFORMLY </p><p>NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF U.S. VALUES AND INTERESTS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4. SINCE THE GOS/NIF SEIZED POWER IN 1989 IT HAS </p><p>BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THIS OSTENSIBLY </p><p>MILITARY GOVERNMENT IS A TOOL OF SUDAN\'S NATIONAL </p><p>ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF).  SPEAKING TO U.S. OFFICIALS, </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE GOS AND THE NIF THAT CONTROLS </p><p>IT OFTEN PORTRAY THEMSELVES AS "MODERATE" ISLAMISTS. </p><p>THEY SAY THEY BEAR NO FUNDAMENTAL HOSTILITY TO THE </p><p>WEST OR TO THE U.S., AND BLAME STRAINED U.S- SUDANESE </p><p>RELATIONS ON AN ALLEGED U.S. BIAS AGAINST ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>GOS/NIF SEEKS TO INDOCTRINATE SUDAN </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. THEIR PROTESTATIONS, HOWEVER, ARE BELIED BY THE </p><p>EXTREMIST MESSAGE THE REGIME PROPOUNDS TO THE </p><p>SUDANESE.  THE UBIQUITOUS GOS/NIF PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN </p><p>PROMOTES A MILITANT AND INTOLERANT VERSION OF ISLAM. </p><p>ALTHOUGH SUDANESE BELONG TO A VARIETY OF CREEDS, </p><p>OFFICIAL RHETORIC TREATS ISLAM AS THE DE FACTO STATE </p><p>RELIGION AND ADVOCATES INFUSING ALL OF SOCIETY WITH </p><p>ITS VALUES.  OFFICIAL PROPAGANDA EXTOLS THE WAR IN </p><p>THE SOUTH AS A "JIHAD" (HOLY WAR) AGAINST UNBELIEVERS. </p><p> </p><p>6. NOWHERE, PERHAPS, IS THE EXTREMISM OF GOS/NIF </p><p>ISLAMIST PROPAGANDA MORE APPARENT THAN IN ITS </p><p>TREATMENT OF THE WEST.  GOS/NIP OFFICIALS ROUTINELY </p><p>DEPICT THE WEST AS UNGODLY, DECADENT, AND HOSTILE. </p><p>THEY SINGLE OUT THE U.S. FOR SPECIAL ATTACK, </p><p>PORTRAYING IT AS A MALEVOLENT POWER BENT ON COMBATING </p><p>ISLAM.  THIS DRUMBEAT IS RELENTLESS AND PERVASIVE. </p><p> </p><p>7. IT IS A STAPLE OF THE GOS-CONTROLLED MEDIA, WHICH </p><p>ARE FULL OF COMMENTARIES, ARTICLES, EDITORIALS, AND </p><p>SONGS LAMBASTING THE U.S.  A POPULAR VIDEO THE T.V. </p><p>IS RUNNING SUMS UP THE MESSAGE, PORTRAYING THE U.S. </p><p>AS THE FOE.  IMAGES OF U.S. FORCES ARE CONTRASTED </p><p>WITH SHOTS OF THE GOS\'S ISLAMIC POPULAR DEFENCE </p><p>FORCES (PDF) MARCHING PROUDLY BY.  OTHER IMAGES SHOW </p><p>LIGHTNING SYMBOLICALLY STRIKING THE U.S. STATUE OF </p><p>LIBERTY.  THE LYRICS AMPLIFY THE THEME OF THE U.S. AS </p><p>THE ENEMY.  SUCH PROPAGANDA IS DAILY MEDIA FARE. </p><p> </p><p>8. THE GOS/NIP\'S RADICAL ISLAMIST MESSAGE, WITH ITS </p><p>STRONG ANTI-U.S. COMPONENT, IS CONVEYED IN OTHER WAYS </p><p>AS WELL.  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUDANESE A YEAR ABSORB </p><p>HEAVY DOSES OF IT IN POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES\' </p><p>TRAINING.  (PDF SONGS OFTEN DESCRIBE HOW THE PDF WILL </p><p>DEFEAT THE AMERICANS.)  PRO-NIP TEACHERS RELAY THE </p><p>MESSAGE IN SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES, AND </p><p>GOS-APPOINTED PREACHERS ECHO THE THEMES IN SERMONS AT </p><p>MOSQUES. </p><p> </p><p>9. JUST HOW MUCH IMPACT THIS PROPAGANDA HAS IS HARD </p><p>TO TELL.  MANY SUDANESE DISMISS IT OUT OF HAND. </p><p>OTHERS, HOWEVER, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG AND LESS </p><p>EDUCATED, HEED IT MORE.  MANY HAVE NO OTHER SOURCE OF </p><p>INFORMATION ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD.  MOROEVER, SUDANESE </p><p>MUSLIMS ARE OFTEN DEEPLY RELIGIOUS.  BY PORTRAYING </p><p>ISLAM AS UNDER U.S. ASSAULT, GOS/NIP PROPAGANDA </p><p>ELICITS AMONG SOME AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE.  WE THINK </p><p>THIS PROPAGANDA IS CONVINCING A SEGMENT OF OPINION </p><p>THAT ISLAM IS THREATENED AND THAT THE US. IS THE FOE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>AND TRIES TO PROMOTE RADICALISM WORLDWIDE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. THE GOS/NIP IS NOT CONTENT, HOWEVER, WITH PUSHING </p><p>RADICAL ISLAM AT HOME.  IT PROMOTES ITS WORLDVIEW </p><p>ABROAD AS WELL.  A SPECIAL UNIVERSITY IN KHARTOUM, </p><p>AFRICA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY (AIU), SCHOOLS </p><p>THOUSANDS OF FOREIGNERS, MOSTLY AFRICANS, IN THE NIP </p><p>VERSION OF ISLAM.  ALMOST ALL ARE ON SCHOLARSHIPS. </p><p>FOREIGNERS ALSO HAVE SCHOLARSHIPS TO OTHER SUDANESE </p><p>UNIVERSITIES WHERE THE TEACHING LIKEWISE LEANS </p><p>HEAVILY TOWARD RADICAL ISLAM, WITH A STRONG </p><p>ANTI-WESTERN COMPONENT. </p><p> </p><p>11. UPON GRADUATING, THESE STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO </p><p>GO HOME TO IMPART WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED. </p><p>ADMITTEDLY, JUST AS MOSCOW\'S PATRICE LUMUMBA </p><p>UNIVERSITY PRODUCED ITS SHARE OF ANTI-COMMUNISTS, NOT </p><p>ALL FOREIGN STUDENTS ARE IMPRESSED WITH WHAT THEY SEE </p><p>AND HEAR IN SUDAN.  STILL, A NUMBER LEAVE CONVINCED. </p><p> </p><p>12. THE GOS/NIF FURTHER PROMOTES RADICAL ISLAM </p><p>THROUGH EXTENSIVE TIES TO LIKE-MINDED ISLAMISTS </p><p>WORLDWIDE.  TWO INSTRUMENTS TO THIS END ARE THE </p><p>POPULAR ARAB ISLAMIC CONFERENCE (PAIC), HEADED BY NIF </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL HASSAN TURABI, AND THE COUNCIL FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEOPLES\' FRIENDSHIP (CIPF), HEADED BY A </p><p>TURABI PROTEGE. </p><p> </p><p>13. THE PAIC AND THE CIPF MAINTAIN LINKS WITH GROUPS </p><p>AS DISPARATE AS LOUIS FARRAKHAN\'S NATION OF ISLAM AND </p><p>ISLAMIST GROUPS IN TAJIKSTAN AND KASHMIR.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE NATURE OF THESE CONTACTS IS SHADOWY, THE PAIC AND </p><p>CIPF CLEARLY OFFER OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT AND MORAL SUPPORT.  WE KNOW THE PAIC </p><p>AND CIPF HAVE ALSO, ON OCCASION, FUNDED FOREIGN </p><p>ISLAMISTS. </p><p> </p><p>14. OTHER TOOLS FOR SPREADING THE ISLAMIST AGENDA ARE </p><p>SUDANESE ISLAMIC NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, </p><p>AMONG WHICH DAWA ISLAMIIYA, MUWAFAQ, AND THE ISLAMIC </p><p>AFRICAN RELIEF ASSOCIATION (IARA) ARE THE BEST </p><p>KNOWN.  THEY OPERATE IN SEVERAL FOREIGN COUNTRIES, </p><p>NOTABLY IN AFRICA.  OSTENSIBLY ENGAGED IN BENEVOLENT </p><p>WORK, THESE NIF INSTRUMENTS ALSO SPREAD NIF VIEWS. </p><p>THE FACT THAT THE CASH-STRAPPED GOS/NIF SPENDS </p><p>MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR ON AIU, THE PAIC AND CIPF, </p><p>AND ISLAMIC NGOS SPEAKS OF ITS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>SPREADING ITS VERSION OF ISLAM AMONG MUSLIMS AND </p><p>NON-MUSLIMS ALIKE.  THE MESSAGE BEING SPREAD </p><p>INCLUDES, OF COURSE, HOSTILITY TO THE WEST AND THE </p><p>U.S. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>GOS/NIF DESTABILIZING NEIGHBORS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. NOR DOES THE GOS/NIF MERELY PEACEFULLY PEDDLE ITS </p><p>VIEWS ABROAD.  IT IS NOT LOATHE TO EXPORTING </p><p>POLITICAL CHANGE BY FORCE.  GOS/NIF SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>ERITREAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, AN ISLAMIST MOVEMENT THAT </p><p>SEEKS THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF THE ERITREAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT, LED ASMARA TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS </p><p>WITH KHARTOUM RECENTLY.  THERE IS ALSO CONVINCING </p><p>EVIDENCE THE GOS/NIF IS MATERIALLY ASSISTING THE </p><p>INSURGENT LORD\'S RESISTANCE ARMY (LRA) IN NORTHERN </p><p>UGANDA. </p><p> </p><p>16. GIVEN THE SECRETIVE NATURE OF GOS/NIF LINKS TO </p><p>MANY ISLAMIST GROUPS, IT PROBABLE BUT NOT PROVEN THAT </p><p>IT IS SUPPORTING DESTABILIZATION EFFORTS ELSEWHERE AS </p><p>WELL.  IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS, HOWEVER, SUDANESE </p><p>ISLAMISTS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR SUBVERSION AS FAR </p><p>AFIELD AS MAURITANIA AND TAJIKSTAN (REFS A AND B). </p><p>THIS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUDANESE ISLAMISTS </p><p>MAY HAVE AN AGENDA FOR DESTABILIZATION THAT GOES </p><p>BEYOND SUDAN\'S IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>AND SUPPORTING TERRORISM </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17. BESIDES BEFRIENDING RADICAL ISLAMISTS WORLDWIDE, </p><p>THE GOS/NIF IS SPECIFICALLY SOLLICITOUS OF </p><p>TERRORISTS.  IT HAS AN OPEN DOOR POLICY FOR EVERY </p><p>MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST GROUP.  HAMAS, THE VARIOUS </p><p>FACTIONS OF THE PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, THE ABU </p><p>NIDAL ORGANIZATION, HIZBALLAH, THE POPULAR FRONT FOR </p><p>THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE-GENERAL COMMAND, AND THE </p><p>FRONT ISLAMIQUE DU SALUT (FIS) ALL ARE PRESENT HERE, </p><p>OFTEN IN A SIGNIFICANT FASHION, WITH THE BLESSING OF </p><p>THE GOS. </p><p> </p><p>18. THE INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST CARLOS LIVED HERE FOR </p><p>MORE THAN A YEAR WITH THE PROTECTION OF SENIOR GOS </p><p>OFFICIALS BEFORE KHARTOUM, UNDER PRESSURE FROM </p><p>FRANCE, RELUCTANTLY TURNED HIM OVER.  RENEGADE SAUDI </p><p>BUSINESSMAN OSAMA BIN LADEN, A PATRON OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIST EXTREMISTS, HAS MOVED HIS HOME </p><p>AND HEADQUARTERS TO SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>19. THANKS TO GOS/NIF HOSPITALITY, TERRORISTS OF </p><p>EVERY DESCRIPTION CAN GATHER QUIETLY IN SUDANESE </p><p>SAFE-HOUSES, FAR FROM THE UNWANTED ATTENTION OF THEIR </p><p>HOME-COUNTRY SECURITY SERVICES.  SUDAN HAS ALSO </p><p>PROVIDED DIFFERENT GROUPS MATERIAL ASSISTANCE AT </p><p>VARIOUS TIMES.  ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO ISRAEL PUBLICLY </p><p>PRODUCED A HAMAS MEMBER CAPTURED IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES, WHO CONFESSED HE HAD RECEIVED MILITARY </p><p>TRAINING IN SUDAN.  ALSO A FEW WEEKS AGO, TUNISIA </p><p>DISCLOSED IT HAD ARRESTED TEN TUNISIAN TERRORISTS WHO </p><p>HAD TRAINED IN SUDAN (REF C).  REPORTING IN OTHER </p><p>CHANNELS SHOWS THAT THE GOS/NIF HAS HELPED FUNNEL </p><p>WEAPONS TO THE FIS AND GIVEN ARMS, TRAINING, FUNDS </p><p>AND TRAVEL DOCUMENTS TO OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>DOES IT MATTER? </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. IN FAIRNESS TO THE GOS/NIF, IT IS NOT THE FIRST </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN THE REGION TO SUPPORT ITS NEIGHBORS\' </p><p>INSURGENTS.  ARGUABLY, UGANDA BEGAN SUPPORTING THE </p><p>SUDAN PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY BEFORE SUDAN RESPONDED </p><p>BY HELPING THE LRA.  GOS/NIF EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE </p><p>ERITREA, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE UNPROVOKED. </p><p> </p><p>21. WE DEFER TO KAMPALA AND ASMARA FOR A DEFINITIVE </p><p>ANALYSIS OF THE DANGER GOS/NIF BEHAVIOR POSES TO </p><p>UGANDA AND ERITREA.  OUR SENSE IS THAT IN BOTH CASES </p><p>IT IS TROUBLESOME BUT NOT REGIME-THREATENING. </p><p>HOWEVER, THIS REFLECTS MORE, IN OUR VIEW, THE </p><p>STRENGTHS OF BOTH REGIMES THAN A LACK OF A SERIOUS </p><p>EFFORT ON THE GOS/NIF\'S PART TO CAUSE TROUBLE.  AND </p><p>IT REMAINS THAT KHARTOUM IS FLOUTING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR AND EARNESTLY FOMENTING </p><p>REBELLION IN COUNTRIES WHERE STABILITY IS A RECENT </p><p>AND HARD-WON GAIN.  AT SOME POINT, IF THE GOS/NIF </p><p>KEEPS TRYING HARD ENOUGH, ITS EFFORTS MIGHT BE MORE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL, EITHER IN THESE TWO COUNTRIES OR </p><p>ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>22. REGARDING TERRORISM, SUDAN, TO THE BEST OF OUR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE, HAS STOPPED SHORT OF DIRECTLY SPONSORING </p><p>AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  MOREOVER, THE </p><p>GROUPS SUDAN ABETS ARE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, A PRODUCT </p><p>OF THE INTERNAL TENSIONS IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY </p><p>WERE BORN.  HAMAS, THE PIJ, OR THE FIS WILL EXIST </p><p>WITH OR WITHOUT GOS/NIF HELP.  FURTHERMORE, THE </p><p>NATURE OF THIS AID IS LIMITED.  SUDAN IS TOO POOR AND </p><p>TOO WEAK A STATE TO GIVE THEM MORE THAN LIMITED HELP. </p><p> </p><p>23. THIS IS NOT, HOWEVER, THE SAME AS SAYING THAT </p><p>GOS/NIF SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM DOES NOT MATTER.  THE </p><p>LOW OR NO-COST ASSISTANCE SUDAN CAN READILY PROVIDE </p><p>-- SAFE PLACES WHERE TERRORISTS CAN MEET, TRAIN, OR </p><p>SIMPLY REST AND RECUPERATE DISCREETLY -- IS OF NO </p><p>SMALL VALUE TO CLANDESTINE TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>24. TERRORISM, MOREOVER, REMAINS A RELATIVELY </p><p>LOW-COST UNDERTAKING.  IT DOES NOT TAKE MASSIVE </p><p>INFUSIONS OF WEAPONS OR CASH TO INCREASE A TERRORIST </p><p>GROUP\'S ABILITY TO DO HARM.  EVEN DIRT-POOR SUDAN CAN </p><p>GIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS REGARD. </p><p>AGAIN, THE GROUPS SUDAN HELPS DO NOT NEED THE GOS/NIF </p><p>TO THRIVE; THE HELP DOES ENHANCE, HOWEVER, THEIR </p><p>ABILITY TO CAUSE TROUBLE.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT </p><p>ANY HELP TERRORISTS RECEIVE IS TOO MUCH HELP. </p><p> </p><p>25. LASTLY, DOES IT MATTER THAT SUDAN INDOCTRINATES </p><p>ITS OWN PEOPLE AND OTHERS IN RADICAL ISLAM?  IT </p><p>PROBABLY DOES.  PRECISELY WHAT IMPACT </p><p>SUDANESE-TRAINED ISLAMISTS HAVE WHEN THEY RETURN TO </p><p>THEIR HOME COUNTRIES IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL.  AT A </p><p>MINIMUM, HOWEVER, SUDAN\'S EFFORTS ARE INCREASING THE </p><p>NUMBERS OF THOSE, IN AND OUT OF SUDAN, COMMITTED TO </p><p>MILITANT ISLAM AND CONVINCED THE U.S. IS ITS FOE. </p><p>THIS CAN DO NO GOOD AND CAN CAUSE SOME HARM. </p><p> </p><p>26. IT IS PROBABLY NO ACCIDENT THAT MOST OF THE </p><p>DEFENDENTS IN THE CURRENT NEW YORK CITY BOMBINGS </p><p>TRIAL ARE SUDANESE.  THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE </p><p>GOS/NIF DIRECTED THEM TO COMMIT TERRORISM IN THE </p><p>U.S.  WE DO THINK, HOWEVER, THAT GOS/NIF RADICAL </p><p>PROPAGANDA MAY HAVE HELPED THEM CONVINCE THEMSELVES </p><p>THE U.S. HAS A MAJOR ENEMY OF ISLAM.  FROM THERE ON </p><p>IT BECAME EASIER FOR THEM TO CONCLUDE THAT </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORISM WAS JUSTIFIED IN THE NAME OF </p><p>JIHAD. </p><p> </p><p>27. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE GOS/NIF\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>DO HARM MUST NOT BE OVERSTATED.  MIDDLE EASTERN </p><p>TERRORISTS WILL STILL OPERATE, REGIONAL STABILITY IN </p><p>THE HORN AND ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA WILL REMAIN FRAGILE, </p><p>AND RADICAL ISLAMISTS WORLDWIDE WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>REVILE AND OPPOSE THE U.S. REGARDLESS OF WHAT SUDAN </p><p>DOES OR DOES NOT DO.  GOS/NIF BEHAVIOR, HOWEVER, </p><p>MAKES THINGS WORSE ON ALL THREE SCORES. </p><p>28. IRONICALLY, THIS FOURTH-WORLD COUNTRY THAT RANKS </p><p>ON THE BOTTOM RUNG OF ALMOST EVERY INDICE OF </p><p>DEVELOPMENT -- PER CAPITA GDP, LEVELS OF LITERACY AND </p><p>INFANT MORTALITY, AND THE LIKE -- MANAGES TO PROJECT </p><p>INFLUENCE ABROAD.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS UNIFORMLY </p><p>NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF U.S. INTERESTS AND VALVES. </p><p>GOS/NIP MISCHIEF-MAKING THUS DOES MATTER.  JUST HOW </p><p>MUCH IT MATTERS DEPENDS HOW MUCH ONE VALVES THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEGALITY SUDAN BRAZENLY FLOUTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BENEDICT </p><p></p></div>
