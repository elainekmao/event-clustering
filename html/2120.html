REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) AF PDAS MARK BELLAMY MET WITH A WIDE RANGE OF INDIVIDUALS </p><p>AND ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING MDC PRESIDENT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION, AND OTHER KEY </p><p>PLAYERS DURING A TWO-DAY VISIT TO HARARE OCTOBER 24-26.  MANY OF </p><p>HIS INTERLOCUTORS INDICATED THAT GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, HAVE CONTINUED </p><p>UNABATED SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE ABUJA AGREEMENT IN EARLY </p><p>SEPTEMBER.  SEVERAL URGED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO INSIST </p><p>THAT THE GOZ MEET SPECIFIC MINIMUM ELECTION STANDARDS OR BE </p><p>PREPARED FOR THE FACT THAT THE ELECTION RESULT WOULD NOT BE </p><p>CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE.  TSVANGIRAI PRESSED FOR THE IMPOSITION OF </p><p>TARGETED SANCTIONS NOW, SAYING SUCH A MOVE COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>WARNING TO THE GOZ ON THE NEED FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.  THE </p><p>MDC LEADER CONFIRMED ONGOING LOW-LEVEL TALKS WITH ZANU-PF, BUT WAS </p><p>SKEPTICAL THEY WOULD LEAD ANYWHERE AS PRESIDENT MUGABE IS MORE </p><p>INTERESTED IN GOING IT ALONE THAN IN ENGAGING IN REAL DIALOGUE </p><p>ABOUT THE WAY FORWARD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) DURING HIS OCTOBER 24-26 VISIT TO HARARE, AF PRINCIPAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03250  01 OF 04  310726Z </p><p>DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE MARK BELLAMY MET SEPARATELY </p><p>WITH MDC LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WILSON </p><p>SANDURA, CATHOLIC PRIEST FATHER FIDELIS MUKONORI, LEADERS OF THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION, AND A RANGE OF CIVIL SOCIETY LEADERS. </p><p>BELLAMY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN AND POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF. </p><p> </p><p>FATHER FIDELIS MUKONORI </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN A CONVERSATION OVER BREAKFAST WITH FATHER FIDELIS </p><p>MUKONORI, LEADER OF ZIMBABWE\'S JESUITS AND A LONG-TIME CONFIDANT </p><p>OF PRESIDENT MUGABE, THE PDAS NOTED LITTLE PROGRESS IN </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF ABUJA, AND ASKED WHETHER THE GOZ HAD ANY </p><p>INTENTION OF HONORING ITS ABUJA COMMITMENTS.  YES, FIDELIS </p><p>REPONDED, BUT THEY HAD TO BE PROVIDED WITH POLITICAL COVER. </p><p>ABUJA, HE SAID, IS ABOUT MORE THAN COMPENSATION TO COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS.  IT MEANS POTENTIAL STABILITY TO THE GOZ, BY HOLDING OUT </p><p>THE PROSPECT OF ENSURING THAT RESETTLED FAMILIES ARE PROVIDED WITH </p><p>THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO EARN A LIVING.  THE GOZ, HE SAID, </p><p>REALIZES THAT IT HAS MADE SERIOUS MISTAKES, BUT IT IS NOT USED TO </p><p>BEGGING AND IS TRYING TO SAVE FACE.  THE LAND ISSUE, MUKONORI </p><p>INSISTED, WILL NOT GO AWAY REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE UNITED STATES, AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN REPLIED, RECOGNIZES </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF LAND REFORM.  IT WANTS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE BUT </p><p>WOULD DO SO ONLY IF THE PROCESS IS LEGAL, RATIONAL, AND ORDERLY. </p><p>BELLAMY AGREED, BUT EMPHASIZED THAT THE USG IS MOST CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT GOZ-SANCTIONED POLITICAL INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE WHICH </p><p>APPEARS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE REMAINS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03250  01 OF 04  310726Z </p><p>OFFICE. THE USG, HE SAID, IS TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW IT CAN PLAY A </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.  SOME IN THE U.S., HE </p><p>REPORTED, ARE PRESSING FOR THE IMPOSITION OF TARGETED PERSONAL </p><p>SANCTIONS AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE U.S. RESPONSE.  MUKONORI </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS VIEW THAT TARGETED SANCTIONS WOULD BE </p><p>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, AS THEY WOULD "MAKE MUGABE A HERO WITHIN HIS </p><p>PARTY."  BESIDES, MUGABE HAS BEEN "HARDENED BY INCARCERATIONS AND </p><p>WAR" AND WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY SUCH MEASURES.  HE </p><p>WARNED AGAINST DEMONIZING AN INDIVIDUAL, AND CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT WAS ILL-SERVED BY SYCOPHANTIC ADVISORS. </p><p>ASKED WHETHER MUGABE WOULD RESPECT THE ELECTION RESULT IF HE </p><p>LOSES, MUKONORI DID NOT ANSWER DIRECTLY.  INSTEAD, HE REPORTED </p><p>THAT HE HAS BEEN CHAIRING LOW-LEVEL TALKS BETWEEN ZANU-PF AND THE </p><p>MDC, IN WHICH HE HAS TRIED TO REASSURE BOTH SIDES THAT THEY HAVE A </p><p>FUTURE IF THEY LOSE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  PROGRESS IN THESE </p><p>TALKS HAS BEEN "SLOW," MUKONORI LAMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>JUSTICE WILSON SANDURA </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WILSON SANDURA SAID HE HAD PREFERRED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8508 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03250  02 OF 04  310726Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   DS-00    EAP-00   EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------37C2E1  310730Z /38 </p><p>P 310637Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0156 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 003250 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03250  02 OF 04  310726Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 10/29/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AF PDAS DISCUSSES ZIMBABWE CRISIS WITH MDC LEADER AND </p><p>OTHER KEY NON-GOVERNMENTAL PLAYERS </p><p> </p><p>TO MEET AT THE EMBASSY TO AVOID THE INEVITABLE FLOOD OF QUESTIONS </p><p>HE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IF U.S. DIPLOMATS HAD COME TO HIS OFFICE. </p><p>HE REFERRED TO THESE AS "DIFFICULT TIMES" FOR THE JUDICIARY AND </p><p>RECOUNTED NUMEROUS INCIDENTS OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST JUDGES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE INVASION OF THE SUPREME COURT BY WAR VETERANS. </p><p>SANDURA SAID THE INTIMIDATION INTENSIFIED AFTER THE COURT DECLARED </p><p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK LAND EFFORT IN </p><p>DECEMBER 2000.  THE COURT\'S RULING, SANDURA INSISTED, CANNOT BE </p><p>CRITICIZED ON LEGAL GROUNDS, ONLY ON THE POLITICAL BASIS THAT IT </p><p>DOES NOT PERMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO DO WHAT IT WANTS.  THE </p><p>INTIMIDATION, HE SAID, WAS DESINED TO PRESSURE JUDGES INTO </p><p>ISSUING SYMPATHETIC RULINGS; WHEN THAT DID NOT WORK, THE GOZ TRIED </p><p>TO USH SANDURA AND HIS COLLEAGUES OUT INDIVIDUALLY. </p><p>6.  (C) SANDURA SAID HE IS THE MOST SENIOR JUDGE N ZIMBABWE, </p><p>AFTER JUSTICE MCNALLY, WHO RETIRES I DECEMBER, AND SHOULD HAVE </p><p>BEEN THE NATURAL CHOICE FOR THE CHIEF JUSTICE POSITION AFTER THE </p><p>FORCED RETIREMENT OF ANTHONY GUBBAY.  INSTEAD, "FOR OBVIOUS </p><p>REASONS," THE GOZ APPOINTED GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU, WHO IS "MORE A </p><p>POLITICIAN THAN A JUDGE" AND WHO IS JUNIOR TO ALL OF THE OTHER </p><p>JUDGES ON THE SUPREME COURT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SANDURA NOTED THAT THE GOZ HAD RECENTLY APPOINTED THREE </p><p>NEW JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT.  DID THE GOVERNMENT NOW HAVE A </p><p>COURT IT IS COMFORTABLE WITH, BELLAMY ASKED?  TWO OF THE NEW </p><p>APPOINTEES -- JUSTICES MALABA AND CHEDA -- HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03250  02 OF 04  310726Z </p><p>LAND UNDER FAST TRACK, SANDURA POINTED OUT.  HOW COULD INDIVIDUALS </p><p>WHO HAVE BENEFITTED FROM A PROGRAM ADJUDICATE THE LEGALITY OF THAT </p><p>PROGRAM, SANDURA ASKED?  THAT SAID, HE WAS NOT CONVINCED THAT </p><p>MALABA AND CHEDA WOULD RULE WITH CHIDYAUSIKU IN EVERY CASE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE ASSESSED JUSTICE VERNANDA ZIYAMBI TOBE FIRMLY IN THE </p><p>NEW CHIEF JUSTICE\'S CAMP.  SANDURA NOTED THAT THE COURT, IN WHICH </p><p>FOUR OF THE FIV JUSTICES WHO SAT WERE RECENT APPOINTEES, ISSUED </p><p>AN INTERIM ORDER ALLOWING THE GOZ TO PROCEED WITH CQUIRING FARMS </p><p>LISTED FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITIONPRIOR TO JUNE 30.  HE PREDICTED </p><p>THAT CHIDYAUSIKU WOULD BIDE HIS TIME AND NOT ISSUE A FINAL RULING </p><p>N THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE FAST TRACK PROGRAM NTIL SOMETIME </p><p>NEXT YEAR, MUCH CLOSER TO THE PRESDENTIAL ELECTION.  ASKED </p><p>WHETHER HE INTENDED TO EMAIN ON THE COURT, DESPITE ITS </p><p>POLITICIZATION, SANDURA REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>LUNCH WITH USID CORE PARTNERS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) USAID\'S CORE PARTNERS, COMPRISING LEADIN CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, DESCRIBED CONTINUIG POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND </p><p>SUGGESTED SPECIFIC DIPLOMATIC STEPS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>OUGHT TO URSUE.  TONY REELER, DIRECTOR OF ONE OF ZIMBABWE\'SMOST </p><p>PROMINENT HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, AMANITRUST, EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE ABUJA AGREEMET\'S FOCUS ON LAND.  WINNING THE </p><p>ELECTION IS THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABE, AND ABUJA IS MERELY A DELAYING TACTIC FROM HARAE\'S </p><p>PERSPECTIVE.  THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL VIOLENC HAS NOT DECREASED </p><p>ONE IOTA SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE ABUJA AGREEMENT, REELER </p><p>ASSERTED.  LYDIA ZIGOMO, HEAD OF ZIMBABWE WOMEN LAWYERS FOR HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS, AGREED.  SHE CLAIMED THAT THE GOZ IS ESTABLISHING </p><p>"REEDUCATION CAMPS" IN RURAL AREAS WHERE GIRLS FROM NEARBY AREAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03250  02 OF 04  310726Z </p><p>ARE FORCED TO SERVE AS COOKS AND SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL ABUSE. ZIGOMO </p><p>ADDED AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN THAT THE GOZ IS CONDUCTING AN </p><p>AGGRESSIVE CLAMPDOWN ON NGOS AND THEIR ACTIVITIES NATIONWIDE. </p><p>REGINALD MATCHABA-HOVE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ZIMBABWE ELECTION SUPPORT </p><p>NETWORK (ZESN), SAID HE HAD ADVISED NGOS TO OPEN OFF-SHORE BANK </p><p>ACCOUNTS AS A PALLIATIVE MEASURE IN CASE THE GOZ DECIDES TO TAMPER </p><p>WITH THEIR DOMESTIC ACCOUNTS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) SARAH CHIUMBU, DIRECTOR OF THE MEDIA INSTITUTE OF SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA (MISA), SHARED HER CONCERN THAT INFORMATION MINISTER </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO CONTINUES TO USE THE STATE MEDIA AS HIS PERSONAL </p><p>VEHICLE AND THAT EQUAL ACCESS TO THE MEDIA FOR ALL PARTIES IS AN </p><p>UNACHIEVABLE OBJECTIVE UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  CHIUMBU ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT ONGOING HARASSMENT OF JOURNALISTS, A </p><p>PARTICULARLY SERIOUS PROBLEM IN RURAL AREAS, AND ABOUT </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S INTENTION TO BAR NGOS FROM CONDUCTING VOTER </p><p>EDUCATION.  EILEEN SAWYER, EXECUTIVE-DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL </p><p>RESOURCES FOUNDATION (LRF), SAID THE RECENTLY-PASSED CITIZENSHIP </p><p>ACT AMENDMENT, WHICH REQUIRES THOSE HOLDING DUAL CITIZENSHIP TO </p><p>RENOUNCE THEIR CLAIM TO CITIZENSHIP FROM ZIMBABWE OR THE SECOND </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8509 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03250  03 OF 04  310726Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  WHA-00   DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   NSAE-00  IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------37C2E5  310730Z /38 </p><p>P 310637Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0157 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 003250 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03250  03 OF 04  310726Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 10/29/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AF PDAS DISCUSSES ZIMBABWE CRISIS WITH MDC LEADER AND </p><p>OTHER KEY NON-GOVERNMENTAL PLAYERS </p><p> </p><p>COUNTRY, COULD DISENFRANCHISE ONE-AND-A-HALF MILLION PEOPLE, </p><p>MOSTLY COMMERCIAL FARMWORKERS.  THE LRF HAS, THEREFORE, FILED A </p><p>CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT CHALLENGING THE LAW\'S CONSTITUTIONALITY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) REELER URGED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DELIVER A </p><p>MESSAGE TO THE GOZ, IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS, THAT THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION MUST MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS OR ELSE </p><p>THE OUTCOME WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE.  SUCH A MESSAGE </p><p>COULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE, REELER THOUGHT, SINCE LEGITIMACY IS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO MUGABE.  HE NOTED THAT MOST ZIMBABWEAN VOTERS ARE </p><p>WAITING ANXIOUSLY TO CAST BALLOTS NEXT YEAR, AND THEY WANT THEIR </p><p>VOTES TO COUNT.  IF THE ELECTION IS STOLEN, THEREFORE, THERE COULD </p><p>BE AN UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE.  MATCHABA-HOVE AGREED, AND ASSERTED </p><p>THAT A SLIM VICTORY BY EITHER PARTY COULD SPARK SERIOUS UNREST. </p><p>HE POINTED OUT THAT THE GOZ HAS DIFFICULTY SAYING "NO" TO OTHER </p><p>AFRICANS AND ENCOURAGED THE UNITED STATES TO PRESS NIGERIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT OBASANJO TO CONTINUE PLAYING AN ACTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>ROLE IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) DIRECTOR DAVID HASLUCK </p><p>TOLD BELLAMY THE CFU WELCOMED THE ABUJA AGREEMENT, AS IT PROVIDED </p><p>EVIDENCE OF GOZ POLITICAL COMMITMENT THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03250  03 OF 04  310726Z </p><p>LACKING, AND SPELLED OUT BROADER PRINCIPLES WHICH, IF ADHERED TO, </p><p>WOULD MAKE ZIMBABWE LIVEABLE FOR ALL CITIZENS ONCE AGAIN.  THE </p><p>PROBLEM, HOWEVER, IS THAT ABUJA HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. </p><p>ACCORDING TO HASLUCK, THE SITUATION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS IS MUCH </p><p>WORSE THAN ON SEPTEMBER 6, THE DAY OF THE ABUJA MEETING.  FARM </p><p>INVASIONS AND PARTICULARLY WORK STOPPAGES CONTINUE TO BE A SERIOUS </p><p>PROBLEM, HE SAID.   BELLAMY ASKED WHETHER THE CFU\'S MEMBERS WERE </p><p>ABLE TO FARM, DESPITE THE OCCUPATIONS, AND HOW SERIOUSLY OVERALL </p><p>PRODUCTION IS BEING AFFECTED.  THERE IS A RANGE OF SITUATIONS, </p><p>HASLUCK REPLIED.  SOME FARMERS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OFF THEIR </p><p>PROPERTIES COMPLETELY, WHILE OTHERS ARE TRYING TO FARM AROUND THE </p><p>OCCUPIERS.  CFU DEPUTY DIRECTOR MALCOLM VOWLES ADDED THAT MORE </p><p>THAN ONE-THIRD OF COMMERCIAL FARMERS ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO </p><p>UNDERTAKE NORMAL FARMING OPERATIONS, WITH CUTBACKS RANGING FROM 10 </p><p>TO 100 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT WOULD CONVINCE THE CFU THAT THE </p><p>GOZ IS SERIOUS ABOUT IMPLEMENTING ABUJA.  WOULD REMOVING OCCUPIERS </p><p>BE SUFFICIENT?  THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE TO GO THAT FAR, </p><p>CFU PRESIDENT COLIN CLOETE REPLIED.  SIMPLY ALLOWING FARMING </p><p>OPERATIONS TO PROCEED UNHINDERED WOULD BE A HUGE STEP FORWARD. </p><p>ASKED WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COULD DO THAT IT WAS NOT </p><p>ALREADY DOING, CFU VICE-PRESIDENT WILLIAM HUGHES SAID IT IS </p><p>CRUCIAL TO PRESS THE GOZ TO ABIDE BY THE RULE OF LAW, A GOAL </p><p>SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE ABUJA AGREEMENT. CLOETE ADDED THAT </p><p>THE GOZ IS CLEARLY FOCUSED ONLY ON THAT PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT </p><p>REQUIRING THE BRITISH TO COME UP WITH FUNDS FOR LAND REFORM, WHILE </p><p>CHOOSING TO IGNORE THE REFERENCES TO RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW. </p><p>VOWLES NOTED THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY A CREDIBLE LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM ON THE TABLE -- THE ZIMBABWE JOINT RESETTLEMENT INITIATIVE </p><p>-- UNDER WHICH FARMERS HAVE OFFERED THE GOZ ONE MILLION HECTARES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03250  03 OF 04  310726Z </p><p>FOR RESETTLEMENT.  THE GOZ, HE SAID, HAS ACCEPTED THE PLAN IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE AND IT HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY THE WORLD BANK AND UNDP. </p><p>ASKED WHY THIS PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED, HASLUCK SAID THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN GENUINE LAND REFORM.  THE FAST </p><p>TRACK EFFORT, HE SAID, IS ALL ABOUT COERCING VOTES FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) MDC LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI PRESSED FOR THE IMPOSITION </p><p>OF TARGETED PERSONAL SANCTIONS AS A WARNING -- A "YELLOW CARD" -- </p><p>TO THE GOZ TO ENSURE THAT ZIMBABWEANS ARE ALLOWED TO CAST THEIR </p><p>VOTES FREELY AND TO ABIDE BY THE ELECTION OUTCOME.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>ADVOCATED THE SUBSEQUENT IMPOSITION OF COMPREHENSIVE SANCTIONS -- </p><p>THE RED CARD -- IF THE ELECTION IS "SUBVERTED."  ASKED HIS VIEW ON </p><p>THE VALUE OF DIRECT TALKS BETWEEN THE MDC AND ZANU-PF TO AGREE ON </p><p>A WAY FORWARD, TSVANGIRAI SAID ZIMBABWE NEEDS A POLITICAL CULTURE </p><p>WHICH PERMITS THAT KIND OF DIALOGUE.  UNFORTUNATELY, PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE MDC.

THE MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT LOW-LEVEL TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>PARTIES ARE GOING ON, BROKERED BY FATHER FIDELIS MUKONORI, BUT </p><p>THEY ARE EXPLORATORY AND HAVE ACCOMPLISHED LITTLE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) BELLAMY REPORTED THAT THERE NOW IS MUCH MORE ANXIETY </p><p>AMONG ZIMBABWE\'S NEIGHBORS THAN THERE WAS DURING HIS MARCH 2001 </p><p>VISIT.  MALAWIAN PRESIDENT MULUZI, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS QUITE </p><p>OUTSPOKEN ABOUT HIS CONCERNS AND BELIEVES MUCH MORE PRESSURE MUST </p><p>BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE GOZ, PARTICULARLY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>ENSURING FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.  TSVANGIRAI SAID HE HAD SEEN A </p><p>DRAMATIC CHANGE AMONG SADC MEMBERS, WHO NOW HAVE A MUCH BETTER </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF DEVELOPMENTS HERE, AND HE PRAISED SADC PRESIDENTS </p><p>FOR BEING MORE ATTENTIVE TO ZIMBABWE\'S DIFFICULTIES.  ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THE MDC IS IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH SADC NEIGHBORS, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SAID THEY ARE IN "CONSTANT" COMMUNICATION WITH THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SOUTH AFRICANS, VIA THEIR EMBASSY IN HARARE.  THE OTHER EMBASSIES, </p><p>THOUGH, HAVE "KEPT THEIR DISTANCE." </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) TSVANGIRAI CONFIRMED THAT HE CONTINUES TO HOLD DISCREET </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH MILITARY OFFICERS.  ASKED WHETHER HE WAS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT THE MILITARY WOULD ABIDE BY THE ELECTION RESULTS IF </p><p>HE WERE TO WIN, TSVANGIRAI SAID HE WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>LIKELY REACTION OF WAR VETERANS AROUND THE COUNTRY, WHO ARE BEING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03250  04 OF 04  310726Z </p><p>ISSUED LARGE NUMBERS OF WEAPONS FROM THE ARMY\'S ARMS DEPOTS.   THE </p><p>MDC PRESIDENT PREDICTED THAT HE WOULD WIN 65-70 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL VOTE NEXT YEAR, DEPENDING ON TURNOUT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) BELLAMY\'S INTERLOCUTORS PROVIDED A COMPELLING PICTURE OF </p><p>ONGOING POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, DESPITE </p><p>THE GOZ\'S COMMITMENTS AT ABUJA.  WE AGREE THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S </p><p>OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE IS WINNING THE ELECTION, AND THAT FAST TRACK </p><p>IS BEING WIELDED PRIMARILY AS A TOOL OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST </p><p>SUSPECTED OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS.  IN THAT LIGHT, WE WOULD ARGUE IT </p><p>IS CRITICAL THAT WE SECURE CONSENSUS AMONG KEY PLAYERS --SADC, THE </p><p>EU, AND THE COMMONWEALTH -- ON MINIMUM STANDARDS WE EXPECT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO ADHERE TO IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION, AND PRESENT </p><p>THOSE EXPECTATIONS IN A UNIFIED DIPLOMATIC APPROACH TO THE GOZ. </p><p>SINCE THE SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM ENDORSED AN EXCELLENT SET OF </p><p>ELECTORAL STANDARDS IN MARCH 2001 AT A MEETING ATTENDED BY SPEAKER </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, TWO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM </p><p>ZANU-PF AND ONE FROM THE MDC, WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT OUR DEMARCHE </p><p>DRAW EXCLUSIVELY FROM THAT DOCUMENT.  SUCH AN APPROACH TO THE GOZ </p><p>SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT AN ELECTION WHICH DOES NOT MEET THOSE </p><p>STANDARDS WILL BE CONSIDERED ILLEGITIMATE.  SADC PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>SUCH AN EFFORT IS CRUCIAL, AS MUGABE DOES CARE WHAT HIS NEIGHBORS </p><p>THINK, AND MIGHT PAUSE AT THE PROSPECT OF ACHIEVING VICTORY AT ALL </p><p>COSTS IF ONE OF THE COSTS IS SADC\'S REJECTION OF THE ELECTION </p><p>OUTCOME. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03250  04 OF 04  310726Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
