(C) SUMMARY: On July 23, 3rd Group Battalion Commander LTC </p><p>Tim Sherwood briefed Chief of Army Staff, MG Alexander </p><p>Ogomudia, on Operation Focus Relief Phase III (OFR P3). </p><p>Initially taciturn, Ogomudia quickly turned receptive and </p><p>largely positive.  During the briefing on basing, Ogomudia </p><p>reminded his staff that he had instructed that the 20 </p><p>Battalion Serti could not participate in OFR P3.  However, </p><p>after being told that it would be extremely difficult to </p><p>change course now that base construction had begun, Ogomudia </p><p>relented.  Clearly with a mind to the border with Cameroon, </p><p>he told his staff that another battalion might have to be </p><p>sent to Serti after the 20 Battalion deployed.  Ogomudia\'s </p><p>staff raised questions on human rights vetting, the scale of </p><p>equipment in OFR and the radios being provided. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) After the briefing, a relaxed and friendly Ogomudia </p><p>received the team in his private office. He suggested that a </p><p>Nigerian Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) team attend </p><p>training at the three sites.  He also thought a visit to </p><p>Sierra Leone by a U.S. Special Forces representative and a </p><p>Nigerian Officer might be useful to evaluate the training </p><p>from Phase I.  (See Reftel for USDAO reporting on the same </p><p>subject.) END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On July 23, an OFR team composed of the 3rd Group </p><p>Battalion Commander LTC Tim Sherwood, 30th Medical Brigade </p><p>Commander Colonel Lamez Schoomaker, Major Marc Wisecarver, </p><p>Acting Defense Attache Cass and PolMilOff, met with Chief of </p><p>Army Staff (COAS), MG Alexander Ogomudia.  Ogomudia was </p><p>accompanied by several staff officers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) After the 10-minute briefing by LTC Sherwood which </p><p>included a summary of the POI, and which MG Ogumudia voiced </p><p>no objection to the POI, MG Ogomudia turned to his staff and </p><p>reminded them that he had instructed that the 20 Battalion </p><p>Serti could not participate in OFR P3 because of concerns </p><p>about the state of relations with "a neighbor." He asked why </p><p>we were proceeding with construction in Serti.  Major Cass </p><p>exclaimed that we had not been made aware of his decision. </p><p>His staff, clearly at a loss to explain the situation, was </p><p>silent.  LTC Sherwood noted that base construction had been </p><p>underway for some weeks, and it would be extremely difficult </p><p>to change course now.  Ogomudia relented, but told his Chief </p><p>of Operations that, while the 20 Battalion could participate, </p><p>another battalion might have to be sent to Serti after 20 </p><p>Battalion deployed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The General Staff asked about the radios the </p><p>battalions would receive, noting that they preferred PRC-117 </p><p>radios over the Motorola radios issued during OFR, Phase 1. </p><p>The major complaint was communications security.  However, </p><p>one of the General Staff noted that this had been resolved by </p><p>the UN through issuance of particular frequencies to each </p><p>UNAMSIL contingent.  The General Staff also asked about the </p><p>scale of equipment, noting a disparity between OFR assistance </p><p>and UN scale.  In particular, they requested APCs vice Toyota </p><p>Hi-Lux 4x4s.  The ADATT responded that concerns such as these </p><p>could be raised with Washington, but that OFR was based on a </p><p>limited budget, and it was very unlikely at this point that </p><p>the equipment list could be adjusted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The ADATT then took the opportunity to raise the 22 </p><p>vehicles from Phase I that had yet to be shipped to Sierra </p><p>Leone.  MG Ogomudia gave a thumbs-up, and said that he had </p><p>spoken that morning with the PermSec at the Ministry of </p><p>Defense as well as the MOD Chief of Logistics.  He noted that </p><p>shipping might have to be arranged at the Defense </p><p>Headquarters level (read Chief of Defense Staff), but said, </p><p>"It,s my soldiers in the rain without tents."  He then noted </p><p>that either by commercial means, Air Force lift, or "another </p><p>route," the vehicles would be shipped. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Human rights vetting was then discussed.  The Generals </p><p>suggested that the U.S. simply provide a list of those who </p><p>could not be trained because of their past behavior, and they </p><p>would not include them.  They added that they did not want a </p><p>soldier to be accused wrongly. Major Cass explained that </p><p>vetting was a legal requirement of the United States, and was </p><p>done with any country that received security assistance </p><p>training.  PolMilOff explained the process further, noted </p><p>that there had not been any soldiers excluded during Phase I, </p><p>and assured the General Staff that if a name raised any </p><p>flags, the issue would be dealt with privately between the </p><p>Embassy and the Chief of Army Staff to avoid any false </p><p>accusations.  However, the process was the law, was </p><p>important, and would have to be observed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) LTC Sherwood asked the COAS if he would approve an </p><p>Airborne friendship jump.  Ogomudia at first misunderstood, </p><p>and explained that Nigeria had suspended Airborne training </p><p>due to decrepit facilities.  He noted that if the U.S. wanted </p><p>to assist Nigeria with funding to repair the facilities, that </p><p>would be appreciated (but noted that Airborne was not his </p><p>priority).  After clarification, Ogomudia heartily approved </p><p>the idea of a friendship jump. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) After the briefing, MG Ogomudia received the team in </p><p>private.  The Army Chief was relaxed and friendly.  He </p><p>suggested that a Nigerian TRADOC team attend training at the </p><p>three sites to provide feedback to him and the U.S. team.  He </p><p>also suggested that a visit to Sierra Leone by a U.S. Special </p><p>Forces representative and a TRADOC Officer might be useful to </p><p>evaluate the results of training from Phase I on the ground. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT: Several members of the U.S. team were </p><p>stunned when the COAS said he had disapproved training for </p><p>the 20 Battalion Serti.  From his comments and his tight </p><p>facial expression, it was clear that the he was very </p><p>concerned about the situation on the border with Cameroon. </p><p>Fortunately, Ogomudia showed the flexibility needed for </p><p>training to continue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: General Ogomudia, while initially </p><p>taciturn, became warm and friendly over the course of the </p><p>meeting.  At one point, he asked his staff if they had any </p><p>other questions.  When they were silent, he prompted them </p><p>with a smile by reminding them that, "You are on the </p><p>receiving end.  Mine is just to give the orders."  While </p><p>Embassy had grown accustomed to new road-blocks being </p><p>introduced in the security assistance relationship (POI, </p><p>equipment, deployment), a new era of joint-problem solving </p><p>seems to have arrived. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) DAO COMMENT: We view the COAS,s silence following </p><p>the POI brief as giving the POI a nod. END DAO COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
