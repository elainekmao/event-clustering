<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 000716 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) AND EUR/RPM (BAME) </p><p>USNATO FOR DEHART AND MOELLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, PREF, HR, NATO, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: NATO SYG IN ZAGREB: TURNING DOWN THE PRESSURE ON </p><p>    REFORMS? </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 617 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) NATO SECRETARY GENERAL ROBERTSON VISITED CROATIA FOR </p><p>A BRIEF STOPOVER ON MARCH 31.  IN MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MESIC, PM RACAN AND KEY CABINET MEMBERS AND WITH PARLIAMENT </p><p>LEADERS, ROBERTSON DELIVERED A GENTLE MESSAGE, ENCOURAGING </p><p>CROATIA TO STAY ON TRACK WITH REFORMS IDENTIFIED UNDER THE </p><p>MAP PROGRAM.  RACAN WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC, CHOD </p><p>LUSIC AS WELL AS DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SIMONOVIC.  STJEPAN </p><p>BARTULICA, HEAD OF THE MFA\'S NATO OFFICE, MET WITH US ON </p><p>APRIL 1 TO DESCRIBE THE MEETING WITH RACAN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A LENGTHY OPENING, RACAN EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>THE LACK OF UNITY ON IRAQ AT NATO.  BARTULICA SAID THAT </p><p>ROBERTSON WOULD NOT BE DRAWN INTO A DISCUSSION ON THE </p><p>SUBSTANCE OF IRAQ, BUT SHARED RACAN\'S CONCERN AND HOPED </p><p>THINGS WOULD BE SET RIGHT AT THE NAC QUICKLY.  BARTULICA TOLD </p><p>US RACAN WAS ADVISED IN THE PRE-BRIEF TO PREEMPT DISCUSSION </p><p>OF FUGITIVE ICTY INDICTEE GOTOVINA BY DECLARING THAT IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF THE DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION, CROATIA BELIEVES THE TIME </p><p>IS RIGHT TO MOVE AGAINST PIFWCS IN THE FRY AND RS.  BARTULICA </p><p>SAID ROBERTSON\'S ONLY MESSAGE ON COOPERATION WITH THE HAGUE </p><p>WAS AN EXPRESSION OF "UNDERSTANDING" FOR THE DIFFICULTY OF </p><p>THE ISSUE; GOTOVINA WAS NOT RAISED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SYG ROBERTSON TOLD RACAN THAT CROATIA IS MAKING GOOD, </p><p>STEADY PROGRESS IN MAP, AND IS A "BEACON" IN A DARK REGION OF </p><p>    EUROPE.  CROATIA SHOULD USE THE MAP REVIEW PROCESS AS A </p><p>ROADMAP FOR REFORMS.  HE HAILED THE UPCOMING SIGNING OF THE </p><p>ADRIATIC CHARTER, AND HOPED THAT IT WOULD SPEED PROGRESS </p><p>TOWARD MEMBERSHIP.  HE PRESSED THE CROATIANS TO DO BETTER ON </p><p>BUILDING AND MAINTAINING PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THEIR BID FOR </p><p>MEMBERSHIP.  HE RAISED REFUGEE RETURNS, BUT GENTLY: NATO </p><p>ISN\'T PRESSING THE GOC TO ENSURE ALL ACTUALLY RETURN, IT MUST </p><p>MERELY CREATE THE CONDITIONS WHEREBY REFUGEES CAN RETURN IF </p><p>THEY WISH TO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) BARTULICA SAID THAT THEY EXPECTED A MUCH TOUGHER </p><p>MESSAGE FROM SYG ROBERTSON.  THE TEXT OF A DECEMBER 2002 </p><p>LETTER FROM THE SYG (LEAKED TO THE LOCAL PRESS) TO PM RACAN </p><p>LAMBASTED THE GOC ON FAILING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON DEFENSE </p><p>REFORM AND DOWNSIZING.  BARTULICA SPECULATED THAT THE </p><p>DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION HAS PROMPTED INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPALS </p><p>TO BACK OFF OF THEIR TOUGH LINE ON CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT SYG ROBERTSON MAY HAVE LEFT </p><p>SOME IN THE GOC WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT ASSASSINATION OF PM </p><p>DJINDJIC MAY BE ENCOURAGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO </p><p>EASE UP THE PRESSURE ON REFORMS.  WHEN EC COMMISSIONER PATTEN </p><p>WAS IN ZAGREB FOR A TRUNCATED VISIT (SO HE COULD VISIT </p><p>BELGRADE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION), HE </p><p>TOLD THE LOCAL EC HOM THAT INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON SERBIA </p><p>MAY HAVE BEEN TOO HARSH AND COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO </p><p>DJINDJIC\'S ASSASSINATION (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>    6.  (C) WE DISAGREE STRONGLY WITH THE PREMISE THAT STRONG IC </p><p>PRESSURE ADDS TO INSTABILITY.  THE DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION DID </p><p>NOT CHANGE THE ISSUES HERE OR THE REASONS WE ARE PUSHING THE </p><p>RACAN GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THEM.  REAL PROGRESS ON </p><p>OUTSTANDING WAR LEGACY ISSUES LIKE ICTY COOPERATION AND </p><p>REFUGEE RETURNS WOULD BE PROGRESS TOWARD BUILDING LONG-TERM </p><p>STABILITY IN THE REGION. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
