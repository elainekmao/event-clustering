<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000367 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, IZ, CA, UNSC, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS SECRETARY POWELL\'S </p><p>IRAQ PRESENTATION "DISTURBING AND PERSUASIVE" </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen Kelly, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Foreign Minister Bill Graham told the Canadian press </p><p>that Secretary Powell\'s February 5 presentation on Iraq </p><p>"amounts to a transfer of the burden of proof from the United </p><p>States to Saddam Hussein."  Graham went on to say that "we </p><p>are not at a point where there is a need to use force. </p><p>However, we don\'t have much time left.  If Dr. Blix comes </p><p>back and says that there is no chance that Saddam Hussein is </p><p>going to cooperate with us, the call for more time, I don\'t </p><p>think, will be very convincing."  The Secretary\'s speech also </p><p>drew favorable comment in the Canadian press, with most </p><p>commentators saying that the presentation made clear that </p><p>Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction from the </p><p>inspectors. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) While Prime Minister Chretien spent the day striking </p><p>a health care deal with provincial leaders, Graham fielded </p><p>opposition questions in the House of Commons after the </p><p>Secretary\'s speech to the UNSC.  While the official </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>opposition Canadian Alliance Party criticized the government </p><p>for not lining up more strongly with the U.S. and the UK, </p><p>other opposition parties (Bloc Quebecois, New Democratic </p><p>Party) called for Canada to oppose any military action </p><p>against Iraq not specifically endorsed by a new UNSC </p><p>resolution. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) All opposition parties, including the Progressive </p><p>Conservatives, called for a Commons debate and vote on </p><p>Canada\'s position toward conflict with Iraq.  Ron Hoffman, </p><p>Foreign Affairs\' Director for Defense and Security Relations, </p><p>told us that there is no obligation or tradition in Canada </p><p>for the Government to allow such a vote, and that the ruling </p><p>Liberal Party caucus is too divided on this issue to risk it </p><p>in any case.  Hoffman said that the Secretary\'s presentation </p><p>will help the GoC make its case with the Canadian public, </p><p>which is just as divided as Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: The Secretary\'s speech did not change the </p><p>minds of our critics on the Canadian political left, but it </p><p>has helped us where it matters most, within Cabinet.  The </p><p>evidence that Iraq is concealing WMD from the inspectors will </p><p>help the GoC make the case that Iraq is in breach of UNSCR </p><p>1441, and that there is justification for "serious </p><p>consequences" even if a second resolution is not obtained. </p><p>Graham continues to emphasize the UN process, but he has </p><p>distanced himself from the French and German position on </p><p>inspections for inspections\' sake.  The GoC will not make any </p><p>dramatic moves prior to the inspectors\' February 14 report, </p><p>but it realizes that time is quickly running out and is </p><p>positioning itself domestically to support action against </p><p>Iraq. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
