On 5 April, the DART made a third assessment trip to Umm </p><p>Qasr.  The DART joined up with two members positioned in Umm </p><p>Qasr and met Coalition force representatives and five </p><p>community leaders, who have assumed the role of the civilian </p><p>leadership of the town following the departure of most Baath </p><p>party officials.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Although less looting is reported, Coalition forces are </p><p>concerned about the security of port facilities.  According </p><p>to Coalition forces, the port\'s basic infrastructure is </p><p>sound, but it has not received proper maintenance for years. </p><p>Coalition forces stressed that maintenance would be a key </p><p>factor in any plans to re-establish proper port management. </p><p>If there is not currently a maintenance component in the </p><p>Stevedore Services of America\'s current contract with USAID, </p><p>it is suggested that the contract be revisited to include </p><p>such a component. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Concerns were expressed about the stability of Umm Qasr </p><p>once Coalition forces begin to move out.  There is a great </p><p>need for police enforcement and patrolling.  Concerning </p><p>potential reprisals against Baathist party members, </p><p>Coalition forces stated that the best they can do is to </p><p>mitigate retribution as Coalition forces lack a police force </p><p>as well as adequate capacity and resources. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>CIVIL AFFAIRS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Coalition forces are very concerned that international </p><p>organizations (IOs) and non-governmental organizations </p><p>(NGOs) will bypass Umm Qasr because they do not see a </p><p>widespread need for humanitarian assistance.  If this </p><p>occurs, the Coalition forces feel that they will be expected </p><p>to assume this role, but caution that they lack the capacity </p><p>to fill this vacuum.  Coalition forces are eager to hand </p><p>over humanitarian assistance such as water distribution to </p><p>appropriate U.N. agencies, IOs, or NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>WATER </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The water distribution continues to be an issue of </p><p>concern in Umm Qasr.  While the Coalition forces intended </p><p>that water would be provided free of charge to the local </p><p>population, a system was not put in place to monitor the </p><p>water truck drivers.  On 5 April, Coalition forces announced </p><p>that they will pay the drivers and ensure that water will be </p><p>free of charge.  As 7 April, 26 private trucks were </p><p>providing water to Umm Qasr.  However, while 14 drivers are </p><p>providing water in town at no cost, 12 are selling it in </p><p>outlying villages.  Coalition forces do not have the staff </p><p>to monitor the distributions and have requested UNICEF or </p><p>another organization assume this role. Civil Affairs </p><p>representatives also requested that the DART assist with </p><p>water and food coordination. </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Community leaders who met with the DART stated that </p><p>there were 45 food agents in Umm Qasr.  The majority were </p><p>shop owners and old women.  There are currently 33 agents </p><p>who are willing to restart food distribution.  The remaining </p><p>12 are either too afraid to come forward or are in Basrah. </p><p>The leaders showed the DART a list with the names of food </p><p>agents and beneficiaries.  The DART will facilitate a </p><p>meeting with the World Food Program to re-organize the food </p><p>distribution network.  Community leaders have contacted </p><p>these agents and say that they will also be able to absorb </p><p>the distribution previously handled by agents that have </p><p>fled. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The DART asked if it would be possible to identify the </p><p>internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Basrah presently </p><p>living in Umm Qasr. The community leaders pulled out a list </p><p>and replied that they had already taken the initiative to </p><p>identify the IDPs from Basrah and they had come with their </p><p>ration cards.  . The DART suggested that the food </p><p>distribution be prioritized for the most vulnerable and that </p><p>dairy, meat, and vegetables could be added to the first </p><p>distribution.  Coalition forces have offered to facilitate </p><p>the movement of the commodities from the warehouse for </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Umm Qasr residents have expressed frustration over the </p><p>numerous assessment trips by international organizations, </p><p>without tangible results.  The residents repeatedly </p><p>expressed the need for foods rich in protein, such as meat, </p><p>eggs, and dairy products as well as the need for propane gas </p><p>for cooking. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ELECTRICITY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Coalition forces have once again repaired and restored </p><p>electricity to three-quarters of the town.  The electricity </p><p>plant was recently sabotaged by six persons; one is in </p><p>custody.  While the electricity to the town is functioning, </p><p>the system has become more vulnerable due to the sabotage. </p><p> </p><p>MAPPING </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The community leaders mapped off the principal housing </p><p>and commercial sections of Umm Qasr.  In total, the town is </p><p>comprised of 82 streets; each street has 72 houses.  Up to </p><p>three to four families live in each house.  The North </p><p>Section is the North Indian Camp ("Hindi Court").  It </p><p>consists of 37 streets and has 6,600 inhabitants.  To the </p><p>west of this is the South Indian Camp.  People living in </p><p>South Indian Camp worked at the Port and were forcibly </p><p>relocated by the regime from their homes near the port to </p><p>this area.  Houses around the Customs Office are associated </p><p>with the Ministry of Industry.  Resident of this sector </p><p>worked at the pipe, steel, and cement factories. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>EMPLOYMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  According to community leaders, the lack of employment </p><p>and income are critical problems in Umm Qasr.  Nearly </p><p>everyone worked for the government and the last salary </p><p>received was prior to the start of the war.  In addition, </p><p>residents have spent all their money to prepare for the war </p><p>and in fear that the money would be worthless once the </p><p>regime changed.  It is especially urgent that the port </p><p>begins to function since 10,000 people were previously </p><p>employed there.  The leaders stated that the quick </p><p>development of jobs will be crucial to keep stability in Umm </p><p>Qasr. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>VULNERABILITY/REPRISALS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Community leaders reported that a few nights before the </p><p>meeting with the DART, a mob of over 1,000 people torched </p><p>the house of a Baathist member in North Indian Camp, and </p><p>attempted to burn other Baathist houses. However, one of the </p><p>community leaders prevented further reprisals by telling the </p><p>mob, "We\'ve had many rivers of blood and destruction. We </p><p>should let bygones be bygones and rebuild our country."  The </p><p>leaders expressed concern that great physical destruction </p><p>will take place on 14 April, the Shi\'a Day of Martyrdom. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>TOWN COUNCIL </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  Community leaders have identified a building located </p><p>near the police station that could be used for office </p><p>premises.  It is a bare shell and would require </p><p>rehabilitation and equipment.  Capacity building and </p><p>training in forming a town council, democracy, and elections </p><p>was requested by the community leaders.  They also expressed </p><p>interest in media messaging (print, radio, television) in </p><p>order to promote a climate of reconciliation and to prevent </p><p>lawlessness, looting, and reprisals.  Community leaders </p><p>offered to organize a volunteer police corps. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
