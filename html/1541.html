<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PRETORIA 001173 </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF AND S/S FROM AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: THIN-SKINNED MBEKI WILL REQUIRE DEFT HANDLING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 99 PRETORIA 12315 </p><p>     B. 99 PRETORIA 12316 </p><p>     C. 00 PRETORIA 9150 </p><p>     D. 00 CAPE TOWN 2150 </p><p>     E. PRETORIA 425 </p><p>     F. PRETORIA 533 </p><p>     G. CAPE TOWN 179 </p><p>     H. PRETORIA 619 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR DELANO E. LEWIS. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:   RECENT ACTIONS AND STATEMENTS BY PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI HAVE RAISED CAUTION FLAGS ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO ACCEPT </p><p>CRITICISM AND MANAGE COLLEGIALLY.  THE CHALLENGE FOR U.S. </p><p>OFFICIALS WILL BE TO ACCEPT THIS IMPORTANT, BUT </p><p>HYPERSENSITIVE, AFRICAN FIGURE AS HE IS, AND BUILD A </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE.  POST STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT HE BE </p><p>INVITED TO WASHINGTON EARLY ON TO BEGIN BUILDING THAT </p><p>DIALOGUE. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE CONTROVERSIAL INVESTIGATION OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S </p><p>1999 $4 BILLION ARMS PURCHASE AGREEMENT HAS SO FAR REVEALED </p><p>LITTLE ABOUT THE ARMS TRADE, BUT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI AND THE MINDSET OF HIS KEY ADVISORY TEAM.   AS DETAILED </p><p>IN REFS A-G, PRESIDENT MBEKI AND OTHERS AROUND HIM HAVE </p><p>VIGOROUSLY, SOMETIMES ANGRILY AND SHRILLY, RESISTED CALLS FOR </p><p>AN INVESTIGATION OF THE TRANSACTION THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE </p><p>SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE UNIT OF JUSTICE WILLIAM HEATH, </p><p>ESTABLISHED BY MBEKI\'S BELOVED PREDECESSOR NELSON MANDELA. </p><p>THEY ARGUE THAT SUITABLE AND COMPETENT INVESTIGATORY </p><p>INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT ALREADY EXIST, OBVIATING </p><p>THE NEED FOR ANOTHER INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR. WE ARE </p><p>INCLINED TO AGREE WITH THE SAG ON THE CORE QUESTION THAT THE </p><p>SANDF NEEDED TO PURCHASE SOME NEW EQUIPMENT, AND THE PRICE </p><p>THEY WILL PAY IS REASONABLE.  WE CAN ONLY OBSERVE FROM THE </p><p>SIDELINES THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE AND </p><p>JUDICIAL BRANCHES, AS WELL AS THE FOURTH ESTATE, ON THE ARMS </p><p>DEAL INVESTIGATION AND HOPE THAT SOUTH AFRICA\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>RULE OF LAW IS ULTIMATELY VINDICATED.  BUT THE LARGER ISSUE </p><p>REMAINS FOR US OF HOW TO JUDGE, AND BUILD A DIALOGUE WITH, </p><p>THE MAN AT THE CENTER OF THIS DEBATE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THIS LATEST EPISODE IS ONE OF SEVERAL WORRISOME </p><p>SIGNALS FROM MBEKI AND HIS CAMP THAT RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>HIS JUDGMENT.  MBEKI\'S RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT OVERWHELMING </p><p>SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON HIV/AIDS HAS BEEN MUCH NOTED AND </p><p>DISCUSSED IN INTERNATIONAL CIRCLES AND WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>HIS FAILURE TO SPEAK OUT ON CLEAR HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF </p><p>LAW VIOLATIONS TAKING PLACE IN MUGABE\'S ZIMBABWE HAS ALSO </p><p>BROUGHT HIM MUCH CRITICISM AND HAVE CLEARLY HURT INVESTOR </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN SOUTH AFRICA\'S ECONOMY IN THE PROCESS.  MBEKI\'S </p><p>RELIANCE ON A CORE OF ADVISORS THAT LACK THE EXPERIENCE AND </p><p>DIPLOMATIC SEASONING ALSO UNDERCUTS MBEKI\'S IMAGE EARLY-ON OF </p><p>THE COOLLY RATIONAL MANAGER. THE MINISTER IN THE OFFICE OF </p><p>THE PRESIDENCY ESSOP PAHAD HAS LAUNCHED BLISTERING ATTACKS ON </p><p>THE PRESS WHEN HIS BOSS IS CRITICIZED.  HIS LEGAL ADVISOR </p><p>MOJANKU GUMBI, RUMORED TO BE MBEKI\'S MISTRESS (OR ONE OF </p><p>THEM), OFFERED HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE LEGAL ADVICE ON THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF INCLUDING HEATH IN THE ARMS </p><p>INVESTIGATION. HIS FORMER SPOKESPERSON, THE LATE PARKS </p><p>MANKAHLANA HAD LOST ALMOST ALL CREDIBILITY WITH HIS KEY </p><p>AUDIENCE, THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESS IN THE MONTHS BEFORE HE </p><p>DIED OF A DISEASE THAT MOST WERE CONVINCED WAS AIDS, BUT HE </p><p>WOULD NEVER ADMIT. MBEKI REMAINS UNBLINKINGLY LOYAL TO </p><p>CABINET MINISTERS, SUCH AS THE OFTEN INSULTING AND </p><p>THOUGHTLESS MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY STEVE TSHWETE, </p><p>WHO OUTRAGED THE PORTUGUESE COMMUNITY HERE BY QUESTIONING </p><p>THEIR PATRIOTISM WHEN THEY CRITICIZED MBEKI\'S HANDLING OF </p><p>CRIME ISSUES, OR THE TRUCULENT AND PETULANT FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>NKOSAZANA DLAMINI-ZUMA (REF H), OR HIS HEALTH MINISTER WHO </p><p>CIRCULATED TO THE ENTIRE CABINET LARGE SECTIONS OF A BOOK BY </p><p>AN TOTALLY DISCREDITED AIDS DENIER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  SOUTH AFRICA\'S REPORTERS AND EDITORS HAVE BROUGHT </p><p>THESE INADEQUACIES TO THE PUBLIC\'S ATTENTION WITH UNRELENTING </p><p>ZEAL.  EVEN PAPERS HISTORICALLY SYMPATHETIC TO MBEKI AND THE </p><p>ANC, SUCH AS THE SOWETAN HAVE JOINED A CHORUS OF CRITICS </p><p>QUESTIONING MBEKI\'S LEADERSHIP.  SIPHO SEEPE, FOR EXAMPLE, A </p><p>POLITICAL ANALYST SYMPATHETIC TO THE ANC, WRITING IN THE </p><p>SOWETAN ASKED IF MBEKI IS FIT TO GOVERN.   IN RESPONSE, MBEKI </p><p>AND HIS TEAM OF ADVISORS HAVE TAKEN EXACTLY THE WRONG TACK. </p><p>THEY ACCUSE THE PRESS OF RACISM (ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>BECAUSE IT IS PREDOMINANTLY BLACK), OR OF BEING A MOUTHPIECE </p><p>OF OPPOSITION PARTIES, OR OF HAVING A PERSONAL VENDETTA </p><p>AGAINST MBEKI.  MBEKI\'S AND THE ANC\'S SOLUTION TO THIS </p><p>"PROBLEM" IS NOT TO ENGAGE THE MEDIA ON AN INTELLECTUAL BASIS </p><p>BUT RATHER TO SET UP ITS OWN "NEWS" WEBSITE TO "INFORM" SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA\'S PEOPLE (PRESUMABLY THOSE WITH COMPUTERS) WHO HAVE </p><p>BEEN "MISINFORMED" ON THE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHY MBEKI, WHOSE INTELLIGENCE IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>AND WHO IS WELL RESPECTED PERSONALLY, SHOULD EXHIBIT A </p><p>TENDENCY TOWARD SHRILLNESS AND DEFENSIVENESS IS HOTLY </p><p>DEBATED.   SOME SPECULATE THAT MBEKI AND THE MAJORITY OF ANC </p><p>LEADERS AND OFFICE HOLDERS ARE STILL HANDICAPPED BY THE </p><p>EXPERIENCE OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST APARTHEID.  THEN, ENEMIES </p><p>WERE EVERYWHERE AND THE WORLD FIT VERY NEATLY INTO SHADES OF </p><p>BLACK AND WHITE.  OTHERS SEE MBEKI AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MUST </p><p>ALWAYS BE RIGHT.  WHEN THE FORCE OF MEDICAL AND PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION ON THE CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN HIV AND AIDS GREW TOO </p><p>GREAT, MBEKI ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS "WITHDRAWING" FROM THE </p><p>DEBATE RATHER THAN ADMIT THAT HE POSSIBLY HAD ERRED.    MBEKI </p><p>HAS POSITED THE VIEW THAT NONE OF THE CRITICISMS HE HAS </p><p>RECEIVED WORRIES HIM BECAUSE HE KNOWS THEY AREN\'T TRUE, AS HE </p><p>TOLD THE EDITOR OF DRUM MAGAZINE RECENTLY.   IN THAT SAME </p><p>INTERVIEW, MBEKI SAID THE OPPOSITION WANTS SOMETHING BAD TO </p><p>HAPPEN IN SOUTH AFRICA "SO THEY CAN THEN SAY \'LOOK HOW BAD </p><p>THIS GOVERNMENT IS.\'" </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ULTIMATELY, NO ONE KNOWS WHY MBEKI SOMETIMES </p><p>DISPLAYS THIS IRRATIONAL SIDE, OR WHEN IT WILL MANIFEST NEXT. </p><p>CERTAINLY, HE IS MORE FREQUENTLY REASONABLE, INTELLIGENT, </p><p>AND CAPABLE, AS HE DEMONSTRATED AGAIN IN THE FEBRUARY 9 STATE </p><p>OF THE NATION ADDRESS. MBEKI IS AN AVID READER AND IS ACUTELY </p><p>AWARE OF THE CRITICISMS BEING LEVIED AGAINST HIM.  HE MUST </p><p>ALSO BE AWARE OF THE STREAM OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MEDIA </p><p>THAT HE SHOULD SURROUND HIMSELF WITH AN ADVISORY TEAM THAT IS </p><p>INTELLIGENT, WELL VERSED IN CURRENT AFFAIRS, AND ABLE TO MAKE </p><p>RATIONAL DECISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) USG OFFICIALS MEETING WITH MBEKI SHOULD BE PREPARED </p><p>TO RECOGNIZE HIS DEFENSIVENESS AND HIGH SENSITIVITY TO </p><p>CRITICISM. GIVEN HIS CURRENT GRIP ON THE REINS OF THE ANC, WE </p><p>ANTICIPATE THAT HE WILL BE A PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE FOR SOME TIME TO COME. IT IS </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT HIS CONTROL OF THE ANC COULD WEAKEN OVER THE </p><p>LONGER TERM, AS LACK OF DELIVERY ON SOCIAL ISSUES BEGINS TO </p><p>JEOPARDIZE HIS AND HIS PARTY\'S PREDOMINANCE.  HIS PERCEIVED </p><p>FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE HIV EPIDEMIC, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, COULD MAKE HIM VULNERABLE TO GRASSROOTS </p><p>OPPOSITION, POSSIBLY FROM WOMEN\'S GROUPS.THE NEXT NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTIONS ARE NOT UNTIL 2004, HOWEVER, AND THE TWO-TERM LIMIT </p><p>IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTION COULD ALLOW HIM TO SERVE </p><p>UNTIL 2009. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) DIALOGUE WITH THIS ESSENTIAL AFRICAN LEADER SHOULD BE </p><p>COUCHED IN POSITIVE, SUPPORTIVE LANGUAGE, IN THE HOPE OF </p><p>BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP THAT WILL ALLOW US TO CROSS SWORDS </p><p>WITH HIM AT A LATER DATE IF WE HAVE TO. AMBASSADOR LEWIS HAS </p><p>ALREADY BEGUN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI THAT ENCOURAGES MBEKI TO ADOPT A MORE MODERATE TONE </p><p>WITH HIS ADVERSARIES AND A LESS CONTROVERSIAL STANCE ON </p><p>CRITICAL ISSUES (SUCH AS HIV/AIDS) THAT AFFECT THE WELL-BEING </p><p>OF SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) WE RECOMMEND INITIATING AN EARLY AND HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND MBEKI.  HE HAS MADE </p><p>IT KNOWN TO US THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BE INVITED TO WASHINGTON </p><p>BEFORE NELSON MANDELA, WHOSE GLOBAL STATURE HAS SOMETHING TO </p><p>DO WITH MBEKI\'S OCCASIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OF A FRAGILE EGO. </p><p>WE SUPPORT HIS REQUEST AND HOPE WASHINGTON WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>ACCOMMODATE THIS BRILLIANT, PRICKLY LEADER OF AFRICA\'S MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT STATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEWIS </p><p></p></div>
