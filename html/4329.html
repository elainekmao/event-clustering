<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 002137 </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS; S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, CE, MV </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKAN/MALDIVES:  2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM </p><p>REPORTS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 201772 </p><p> </p><p>1. MISSION\'S RESPONSE TO REFTEL REQUESTING INPUT FOR THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOLLOWS.  DATA </p><p>ON SRI LANKA IS CONTAINED IN PARA TWO AND DATA ON THE </p><p>MALDIVES IN PARA THREE.  PARA 2 IS KEYED TO QUESTIONS A </p><p>THROUGH K IN PARA TWO OF REFTEL.  PARA 3 CONTAINS A </p><p>REVIEW OF THE SITUATION IN THE MALDIVES. </p><p> </p><p>SRI LANKA </p><p>--------- </p><p>2.  (U) DATA ON SRI LANKA: </p><p> </p><p>A -- IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERROR </p><p>ATTACKS, THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY DECLARED </p><p>ITS WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. IN THE GLOBAL </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>MAINTAINED THAT POLICY THROUGHOUT 2002. SRI LANKA HAS </p><p>ACCEDED TO 10 OF THE 12 INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS (SEE </p><p>SECTION F FOR MORE DETAILS) THAT DEAL WITH COMBATING </p><p>TERRORISM AND TOOK STEPS TO IMPLEMENT UNSCR 1333 AND </p><p>1373, WHICH BLOCKED THE ASSETS OF TERRORIST ENTITIES. </p><p> </p><p>B -- THERE HAVE BEEN NO CASES IN SRI LANKA DURING THE </p><p>PAST YEAR OF ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. </p><p>CITIZENS OR FACILITIES.  ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE </p><p>SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT WOULD EXTEND EVERY EFFORT TO </p><p>PROTECT U.S. CITIZENS OR PROSECUTE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>ACTS OF TERRORISM.  IN REGARDS TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AND THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM </p><p>(LTTE) HAVE OBSERVED A CEASEFIRE SINCE DECEMBER 2001. </p><p>THE TWO SIDES HAVE ALSO BEGUN PEACE TALKS.  IN NOVEMBER </p><p>2002, A COLOMBO COURT CONVICTED LTTE LEADER VELUPILLAI </p><p>PRABHAKARAN AND THREE OTHER LTTE MEMBERS IN ABSENTIA FOR </p><p>PLANNING A JANUARY 31, 1996, BOMBING IN COLOMBO THAT </p><p>KILLED 76 AND INJURED HUNDREDS.  THEY WERE SENTENCED TO </p><p>LONG-TERM PRISON SENTENCES.  THE LTTE HAS CATEGORICALLY </p><p>REJECTED THE VALIDITY OF THE COURT\'S RULING. </p><p> </p><p>C -- THE ISSUE OF EXTRADITION IN RELATION TO TERRORIST </p><p>ACTS DID NOT ARISE IN SRI LANKA.  THE UNITED STATES </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE SRI LANKAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO LOCATE AND EXTRADITE INDIVIDUALS IN THREE </p><p>CRIMINAL CASES.  ALTHOUGH THE INDIVIDUALS IN QUESTION </p><p>HAVE NOT BEEN LOCATED AND MAY BE IN LTTE-CONTROLLED </p><p>AREAS, THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKAN WAS RESPONSIVE TO </p><p>USG CONCERNS AND REQUESTS.  THERE IS NO INFORMATION THAT </p><p>INDICATES THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT EXTEND THE </p><p>SAME COOPERATION IN CASES INVOLVING TERRORIST-RELATED </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>D -- MISSION HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS </p><p>TO GSL PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS.  IN FACT, THE SEPTEMBER 1999 SIGNING OF A </p><p>GENERAL EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND SRI </p><p>LANKA (RATIFIED BY THE U.S. SENATE IN OCTOBER AND SIGNED </p><p>BY THE PRESIDENT IN NOVEMBER 1999), FACILITATED </p><p>EXTRADITION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  SRI LANKA HAS </p><p>ALSO SIGNED THE 1988 SAARC REGIONAL CONVENTION ON THE </p><p>SUPPRESSION OF TERRORISM, WHICH DESIGNATES CERTAIN ACTS </p><p>SPECIFICALLY AS TERRORIST ACTS AND NOT AS POLITICAL </p><p>ACTS, THEREBY NULLIFYING ATTEMPTS BY TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS TO CLAIM POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS FOR </p><p>VIOLENCE.  THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT IS ALSO WORKING </p><p>WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO DRAFT A MUTUAL </p><p>LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY. </p><p> </p><p>E -- SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES HAVE MADE </p><p>NUMEROUS PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL WAR ON TERRORISM AND HAVE CONDEMNED </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENTS, SUCH AS THE TERRORIST BOMBING IN </p><p>BALI.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS OF TERRORISM.  IT IS </p><p>CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE DOMESTIC PEACE PROCESS TO </p><p>BRING TO AN END AN ALMOST 20 YEAR CONFLICT WITH THE LTTE </p><p>(SEE SECTION I FOR MORE DETAILS). </p><p> </p><p>F -- DURING 2002, THE GSL HAS FOCUSED ON STABILIZING THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS WITH THE LTTE.  SRI LANKA HAS ACTIVELY </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION SEMINARS </p><p>ORGANIZED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.  SRI LANKA IS </p><p>PARTY TO 10 OF THE 12 INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS THAT </p><p>FOCUS ON COMBATING TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE TOKYO, HAGUE </p><p>AND MONTREAL CONVENTIONS AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE GSL HAS </p><p>REQUESTED ADDITIONAL TRAINING FROM THE UNITES STATES </p><p>GEARED TOWARDS PREPARING THE SRI LANKAN MILITARY TO </p><p>ASSIST IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>G -- NOT APPLICABLE - THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT </p><p>SUPPORT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>H -- THE GSL HAS MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p>THAT SAID, LARGELY BECAUSE OF ITS "NON-ALIGNED" STATUS, </p><p>SRI LANKA HAS NOT PARTICIPATED ACTIVELY IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF CUBA, IRAN, </p><p>IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, AND SUDAN.  FOR THE </p><p>SAME REASONS, ITS CRITICISM OF ANTI-ISRAELI TERRORISM </p><p>HAS BEEN MUTED. </p><p> </p><p>I -- THERE WAS NO DISCERNIBLE CHANGE IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>STRONG INTERNATIONAL ANTI-TERRORISM POSITION IN 2002. </p><p>DOMESTICALLY THERE WAS A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN THE POLICY OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TOWARDS THE LTTE, WHICH IS DESIGNATED AS </p><p>A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION (FTO) BY THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  THE GSL IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN A PEACE PROCESS </p><p>WITH THE LTTE TO BRING AN END TO A 19-YEAR-OLD CONFLICT </p><p>AND IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE KILLED OVER 64,000 PEOPLE.  ON </p><p>DECEMBER 24, 2001, THE LTTE AND GSL ANNOUNCED UNILATERAL </p><p>CEASEFIRES.  ON FEBRUARY 22, 2002, THE TWO SIDES SIGNED </p><p>A CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT THAT INCLUDED STEPS TO DEESCALATE </p><p>THE CONFLICT, ON SEPTEMBER 4 THE GSL LEGALIZED THE LTTE, </p><p>AND ON SEPTEMBER 16 THE TWO SIDES BEGAN PEACE TALKS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON THE LTTE BY </p><p>OTHER STATES, THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO </p><p>VIEW THE USG\'S DESIGNATION OF THE LTTE AS A TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION AS A POSITIVE MEASURE.  IT SITES THE </p><p>DESIGNATION, ALONG WITH THE POST-SEPTEMBER 11 GLOBAL WAR </p><p>ON TERRORISM, AS ONE OF THE REASONS THE LTTE HAS COME TO </p><p>THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. </p><p> </p><p>J -- THE GSL HAS DIRECTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO </p><p>FREEZE ASSETS OF TERRORIST GROUPS COVERED UNDER UNSCR </p><p>1333 AND 1373.  WHERE THE U.S. HAS REQUESTED THE GSL TO </p><p>FREEZE ASSETS OF GROUPS NOT COVERED UNDER THE UNSCRS, </p><p>THE GSL HAS DIRECTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO NOTIFY </p><p>THE CENTRAL BANK OF ANY TRANSACTIONS BY THESE GROUPS. </p><p>THE USG CODUCTS MILITARY-TO-MILITARY ANTI-TERRORISM </p><p>TRAINING WITH GSL TROOPS. </p><p> </p><p>K-I -- THE ISSUE OF COOPERATING WITH THE USG IN </p><p>APPREHENDING, CONVICTING, AND PUNISHING INDIVIDUAL </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM HAS NOT ARISEN. </p><p>MISSION HAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THE GSL WOULD NOT </p><p>COOPERATE IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH COOPERATION WAS </p><p>REQUESTED. </p><p> </p><p>K-II -- THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SEVERAL REQUESTS TO </p><p>THE GSL FOR ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES FOR U.S. </p><p>PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES IN SRI LANKA.  THE GSL HAS MET </p><p>ALL REQUESTS EXPEDITIOUSLY.  THESE REQUESTS WERE MADE TO </p><p>ENHANCE SECURITY IN GENERAL AND NOT IN RESPONSE TO ANY </p><p>IDENTIFIABLE THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>MALDIVES </p><p>-------- </p><p>3. (U)  CONSISTING OF ALMOST 1,200 ISLANDS STRETCHED </p><p>OVER APPROXIMATELY 500 MILES NORTH TO SOUTH IN THE </p><p>INDIAN OCEAN WITH A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 270,000, </p><p>THE REPUBLIC OF THE MALDIVES HAS NO KNOWN INDIGENOUS </p><p>TERRORISM PROBLEM.  THE MALDIVIAN GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, </p><p>HAS EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE TRANSIT OF </p><p>TERRORISTS THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND ALSO OVER THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SERMONS, OF SOME HARD-LINE </p><p>RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS IN THE COUNTRY.  SOME OF THESE </p><p>ALLEGED HARD-LINERS HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND TRIED ON </p><p>VARIOUS CHARGES.  MALDIVIANS ALSO REMAIN FOCUSED ON </p><p>PREVENTING A REPEAT OF THE EVENTS OF 1988 WHEN A FORMER </p><p>MALDIVIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL LAUNCHED A COUP ATTEMPT </p><p>WITH THE HELP OF SRI LANKAN TERRORIST ELEMENTS.  THE </p><p>COUP FAILED DUE TO THE INTERVENTION OF THE INDIAN ARMED </p><p>FORCES.  DESPITE THESE CONCERNS, THE MALDIVES HAS </p><p>EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT IT CAN DEAL WITH POTENTIAL </p><p>PROBLEMS.  DURING AN ATTEMPTED HIJACKING OF A FLIGHT </p><p>TRANSITING THROUGH THE MALDIVES FROM BOMBAY IN EARLY </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2002, THE NATIONAL SECURITY SERVICE RESPONDED </p><p>IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER AND WAS FORTHCOMING AND </p><p>COOPERATIVE WITH USG OFFICIALS REQUESTING INFORMATION </p><p>ABOUT THE INCIDENT.  IN TERMS OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS, </p><p>THE MALDIVES HAS TAKEN STEPS TO IMPLEMENT UNSCR 1333 AND </p><p>1337, WHICH BLOCK THE ASSETS OF TERRORIST ENTITIES.  THE </p><p>MALDIVES HAS ALSO BECOME A PARTY TO THE MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>12 INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
