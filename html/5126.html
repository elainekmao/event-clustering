<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ABU DHABI 000237 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/P - AMBASSADOR RICHARD HAASS </p><p>ALSO FOR NEA/ARP </p><p>NSC FOR ABRAMS AND CLARKE </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD AMBASSADOR LITT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, KWMN, PTER, IR, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: S/P DIRECTOR HAASS AND CHIEF OF STAFF </p><p>    MUHAMMAD BIN ZAYID DISCUSS IRAQ, IRAN </p><p>    AND SAUDI-U.S. RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABU DHABI 114 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) SUMMARY: Policy Planning Director Ambassador Richard </p><p>Haass, Ambassador Wahba and Armed Forces Chief of Staff LTG </p><p>Shaykh Muhammad Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MBZ) had a lively </p><p>exchange on Iraq, Iran and Saudi-US relations, among other </p><p>issues, over a two-hour lunch on January 8.  MBZ briefed </p><p>that the UAE, anticipating a negative public reaction to </p><p>U.S.-led military action against Iraq, would prefer the </p><p>international cover of a second UNSCR.  He recommended that </p><p>the U.S. concentrate on getting humanitarian supplies to the </p><p>Baghdad area early on as Saddam will likely go into siege </p><p>mode and will not hesitate to cut the capital off.  As with </p><p>other visiting U.S. officials, MBZ emphasized the need for </p><p>U.S. engagement with the Qataris to rein in Al-Jazeera.  He </p><p>briefed Ambassador Haass on a rumor circulating in Baghdad </p><p>about a deal that has been cut between the USG and Saddam. </p><p>MBZ queried Haass about the latest USG thinking on Iran.  He </p><p>posited that Tehran is more capable of controlling Hezbollah </p><p>than Syria but nevertheless encouraged greater U.S. </p><p>interaction with Bashar Al-Asad.  He downplayed the rift </p><p>between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, noting that UAE-Saudi ties </p><p>were more complicated but that Abu Dhabi realized the </p><p>importance of maintaining a dialogue with Riyadh.  MBZ </p><p>encouraged continued USG engagement with the Saudis, though </p><p>he took a dim view of some of the Al-Saud.  MBZ also briefed </p><p>Ambassador Haass on what the UAE had found aboard five </p><p>Afghan airliners that had been diverted and searched in the </p><p>UAE the previous day (see reftel).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Policy Planning Director Ambassador Richard Haass </p><p>visited the UAE from January 7-9.  In addition to his </p><p>meeting with MBZ in Abu Dhabi, Ambassador Haass met with the </p><p>Country Team, students from the all-female Zayid University </p><p>(septel) and UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan Nasser Al- </p><p>Suweidi (septel).  In Dubai, Ambassador Haass met with Dubai </p><p>Crown and UAE Defense Minister Shaykh Muhammad Bin Rashid </p><p>Al-Maktoum (septel) and dined at the Consul General\'s </p><p>residence with a host of Dubai intellectuals and business </p><p>elites.  Ambassador Wahba, S/P staffer Dr. Meghan </p><p>O\'Sullivan, and Polchief joined Ambassador Haass for his </p><p>lunch with MBZ.  MBZ was joined by Shaykh Saeed Bin Hamdan </p><p>Al-Nahyan, Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and </p><p>Research Director Dr. Jamal Al-Suweidi and Special Assistant </p><p>Yousef Al-Otaiba. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>MBZ ON IRAQ:  UAE PREFERS SECOND UNSCR; RECOMMENDS PRIORITY </p><p>BE GIVEN TO HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR BAGHDAD AREA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The UAE would prefer a second UNSCR approving the use </p><p>of military force should a peaceful resolution of the world </p><p>community\'s differences with Iraq prove impossible to </p><p>achieve, according to MBZ.  In response to Haass\' query as </p><p>to whether such a resolution would render easier the UAE\'s </p><p>military cooperation with the coalition, MBZ averred that a </p><p>UNSCR would make the prospect of a military confrontation </p><p>easier to market to a skeptical public in the Arab and </p><p>Muslim world.  Nevertheless, MBZ noted that the UAE decision </p><p>on support of U.S.-led action with or without a second </p><p>resolution was final.  Responding to MBZ\'s question about </p><p>U.S. plans for a post-Saddam Iraq, Haass outlined four </p><p>challenges:  humanitarian, political, security and </p><p>reconstruction.  MBZ recommended a robust humanitarian </p><p>assistance program for the Baghdad area, noting that U.S. </p><p>forces would encounter little resistance in the north and </p><p>south.  MBZ predicted that a recalcitrant Saddam would hole- </p><p>up in Baghdad and cut off food supplies to the capital in </p><p>order to trigger a humanitarian crisis, which he could then </p><p>blame on the U.S.  According to Emirati sources in Iraq, </p><p>Saddam has ordered the distribution of food supplies to </p><p>families in the Baghdad area to cover a 3-7 day period only. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) MBZ noted that public opinion in the Arab world would </p><p>be containable provided military action was short and </p><p>decisive.  Keeping Israeli PM Ariel Sharon in his box was </p><p>also important.  Returning to a common theme in his </p><p>discussions with visiting U.S. officials, MBZ emphasized the </p><p>importance of reining in the Doha-based Al-Jazeera satellite </p><p>network prior to any military action.  He recommended </p><p>against sending in journalists with war fighters -- at least </p><p>in the beginning -- as the prospect of televising scenes of </p><p>civilian casualties was just too risky.  MBZ said it was a </p><p>mystery to him why the Qataris continued to inflame public </p><p>opinion via JSC and suggested that the U.S. use its weight </p><p>to pressure Doha.  He laughingly recalled a meeting at the </p><p>start of the Afghan campaign between Qatari Emir Hamad Al- </p><p>Thani and Shaykh Zayid in which Hamad complained about a </p><p>report he had received that MBZ had asked General Franks to </p><p>bomb Al-Jazeera.  According to MBZ, Zayid derisively </p><p>responded:  "Do you blame him?" </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>LIBERATED IRAQIS WILL DANCE IN THE STREETS BUT RUMORS ARE </p><p>CIRCULATING IN BAGHDAD THAT U.S. AND SADDAM HAVE CUT A DEAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Responding to Haass\' question on how the Iraqis would </p><p>view a U.S.-led campaign that results in the ouster of </p><p>Saddam, MBZ said "they will come out and dance in the </p><p>streets."  He warned, however, about rumors circulating in </p><p>Baghdad that the U.S. has cut a deal with Saddam.  Citing </p><p>trusted UAE intelligence sources, MBZ briefed that the U.S. </p><p>is said to have laid down seven conditions under which the </p><p>threat of military action will be taken off the table: </p><p> </p><p>-- Iraq confesses to possession of two "biological </p><p>containers;" </p><p>-- Iraq agrees not to attack Israel; </p><p>-- Iraq cancels its agreement with Russia over the "Majnun" </p><p>oil field; </p><p>-- The regime agrees to amend the Iraqi constitution; </p><p>-- A multi-party system is instituted; </p><p>-- The Baghdad government is reorganized; </p><p>-- Iraq agrees to convene free and fair elections. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Ambassador Haass noted that on a scale of 1-10, with </p><p>10 being completely unbelievable, he rated MBZ\'s information </p><p>as registering a "14".  MBZ asked about U.S. plans for a </p><p>post-Saddam leadership and hoped that the Iraqi exiles would </p><p>not be ushered in, noting that they would not find </p><p>acceptance among the Iraqi people. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>MBZ STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF SENDING MESSAGE TO IRAN TO </p><p>RESTRAIN HEZBOLLAH IN ADVANCE OF ACTION AGAINST IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Turning eastward, MBZ asked for the latest USG </p><p>thinking on Iran.  Haass briefed that there were two debates </p><p>in USG circles:  a) where is Iran heading, i.e. is it on the </p><p>edge of radical change or will reform come slowly, and b) </p><p>what should the U.S. be doing, i.e. should we be dialoguing </p><p>with the regime or should we be isolating them.  He noted </p><p>that a consensus was emerging that Iran over time will </p><p>become more democratic.  Nevertheless, Ambassador Haass </p><p>continued, Iran is a civilization with "Persian ambitions" </p><p>and "civilizations have goals," such as the acquisition of </p><p>nuclear technology.  The U.S. had engaged Tehran somewhat </p><p>successfully at the launch of the Afghan campaign, with </p><p>regard to stemming the flow of terrorists.  Washington, </p><p>Haass continued, was particularly concerned about the </p><p>possibility of an uptick in Hezbollah attacks against Israel </p><p>should the U.S. lead a coalition military attack on Iraq. </p><p>In the U.S. view, both Iran and Syria could restrain </p><p>Hezbollah.  MBZ disagreed with the ability of Syria to fully </p><p>influence Hezbollah, but suggested that certain Iranians </p><p>could be far more effective if they were to receive our </p><p>message.  He warned that Hezbollah fighters are far more </p><p>educated, specialized, tough and, as a result, more lethal, </p><p>than their Al-Qaida counterparts.  The Iranians, MBZ noted, </p><p>are scared to death about the prospect of U.S.-led military </p><p>action against Iraq, fearing that they will be next on the </p><p>list. </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) With regard to Syria, MBZ encouraged continued USG </p><p>engagement with Bashar, noting that otherwise, "the wrong </p><p>guys" will fill the vacuum.  In MBZ\'s estimation, Bashar is </p><p>active and "wants to do good," although his relative youth </p><p>and inexperience are real drawbacks. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>SAUDI-QATAR RELATIONS LESS COMPLICATED THAN SAUDI-UAE TIES; </p><p>U.S. SHOULD PURSUE A QUIET DIALOGUE WITH THE AL-SAUD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) MBZ downplayed tensions between the Saudis and </p><p>Qataris noting that the two populations share Wahhabi roots. </p><p>By contrast, Saudi-UAE relations were far more complex, MBZ </p><p>continued, drawing Haass\' attention to Abu Dhabi\'s nagging </p><p>bilateral border dispute with Riyadh (the Al-Shayba oil </p><p>field).  Nevertheless, the ever pragmatic Emiratis </p><p>recognized the need to deal with the Saudis and have thus </p><p>maintained good relations with Riyadh. </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) MBZ encouraged continued engagement by the U.S. with </p><p>the Al-Saud, commenting that the negative spin in the U.S. </p><p>media complicated Crown Prince Abdullah\'s ability to </p><p>institute reforms.  MBZ cited a recent poll in which 90 </p><p>percent of Saudis believe that, following a regime change in </p><p>Iraq, the U.S. will turn its sights on changing the </p><p>government in Riyadh.  While MBZ took a dim view of some of </p><p>the senior Al-Saud -- sardonically noting that Interior </p><p>Minister Nayef\'s bumbling manner suggested that "Darwin was </p><p>right" -- he wagered that the situation would be far </p><p>different were Fahd in complete control of his faculties or, </p><p>by contrast, if Abdullah was in total control.  Clearly, the </p><p>incompleteness of the leadership transition in Saudi Arabia </p><p>rendered decision-making more problematic, in MBZ\'s view. </p><p> </p><p>12.
