NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE PROMISES MORE OF THE SAME AT ZANU-PF </p><p>CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2742 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Kimberly Jemison for reasons 1.5 b/d. </p><p> </p><p> SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (C) ZANU-PF,s annual conference, concluded in Chinhoyi </p><p>December 14, proved to be another platform from which the </p><p>senior party leadership could blast their critics and blame </p><p>others for the country,s economic woes.  President Mugabe </p><p>tacitly admitted that the land reform exercise had not gone </p><p>well but in the same breath he blamed most of the country,s </p><p>economic woes on the British and other Western powers.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE CONTINUES TO DEMONIZE MDC, BRITAIN, AND THE WEST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>2.  (U) ZANU-PF,s sixth National People,s Conference was </p><p>filled with the same rhetoric the party has been espousing </p><p>over the last year.  The West, the MDC, NGOs, and civic </p><p>groups, led by Britain, are the reason for most of the </p><p>economic problems besieging the country, Mugabe said in his </p><p>opening address.  Mugabe also made a thinly veiled threat </p><p>against Australia, New Zealand, and some EU member states </p><p>that if these countries continued to side with Britain, then </p><p>they would be treated as enemies.  &The more they work </p><p>against us, the more they should expect hostility from us and </p><p>the more negative we shall become to their kith and kin </p><p>here.8  An Australian diplomat in attendance told us Mugabe </p><p>had said explicitly "white people are the enemy" and noted </p><p>that the US was notably absent among the list of countries in </p><p>the diatribe.  (NOTE: Despite assurances from ZANU-PF </p><p>Director of Administration, Fred Shava, that the Embassy </p><p>would receive an invitation to the opening ceremony, we never </p><p>did (see reftel).  Other Western embassies received </p><p>invitations during the week leading up to the opening </p><p>ceremony.  Our Australian colleague told us he had to </p><p>repeatedly ask for their invitation. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>LAND REFORM NOT TOTAL SUCCESS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>3.  (U) Mugabe admitted that it was necessary to review the </p><p>land reform and that there had been disapproval and </p><p>dissatisfaction with some aspects of the exercise, especially </p><p>the A2 model, according to press accounts.  Mugabe was quick </p><p>to say there would be no turning back on the land issue and </p><p>he reiterated a desire to indigenize the mining, </p><p>manufacturing, industry, tourism, and the financial sector. </p><p>Mugabe reiterated a threat he made two months ago to </p><p>nationalize gas stations owned by multinational oil </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Patrick Nyaruwata, the chairman of the Zimbabwe </p><p>National Liberation War Veterans Association, criticized the </p><p>government over corruption in land distribution during his </p><p>speech, according to the independent newspaper, the Daily </p><p>News.   Nyaruwata appealed to Mugabe to act against the </p><p>corrupt officials.  After the speech, John Nkomo, ZANU-PF </p><p>national chairman, admonished Nyaruwata for criticizing the </p><p>government in what was supposed to have been a solidarity </p><p>speech. </p><p> </p><p>CONFERENCE ATMOSPHERICS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5.  (C) Our Australian diplomatic colleague was alarmed at </p><p>the number of guns he saw at the conference.  Machine guns </p><p>were everywhere and seven bodyguards surrounded Mugabe to </p><p>within an arms length. (COMMENT: This is the most bodyguards </p><p>we have known Mugabe to have and is a revealing statement of </p><p>Mugabe\'s personal sense of security, at an event attended </p><p>primarily by his own party supporters.  END COMMENT.)  Few </p><p>Western diplomats attended the conference--the Australian </p><p>diplomat reckons Greece (EU Acting President), Canada and </p><p>Belgium were present--but was reasonably well-attended by </p><p>some Eastern European countries, Arab and African countries, </p><p>Cuba, China, and Indonesia.  As soon as Mugabe finished, most </p><p>of the diplomats left. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>6.  (C) As expected, there was no discussion on succession or </p><p>any substantive shift on policies expressed at this year\'s </p><p>conference.  Conference delegates expressed concern over most </p><p>crises afflicting the country (fuel, food, and HIV) but </p><p>offered no real solutions to the problems, instead proposing </p><p>more price controls, intensified nationalization and </p><p>indigenization of businesses, and mobilization of resources </p><p>to win the Kuwadzana and Highfield parliamentary </p><p>by-elections. In a transparent attempt to boost morale at its </p><p>annual conference, Chinhoyi was flush with food and fuel, </p><p>according to the independent weekly, The Standard.  Prior to </p><p>the conference, Chinhoyi suffered the same shortages as the </p><p>rest of the country (corn meal, bread, sugar, milk, meat, </p><p>chicken, and fuel). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Mugabe\'s attempts to fan racial hatred are troubling, </p><p>but even more worrisome is his absolutist approach to a </p><p>deteriorating economic situation over which he has decreasing </p><p>influence. Mugabe\'s determination to forge on with a </p><p>"business as usual" approach is pushing his regime and this </p><p>country ever closer to the precipice.  While one moderate </p><p>ZANU-PF governor cautioned us not to take the conference\'s </p><p>political rhetoric too seriously, he acknowledged that he was </p><p>worried that the "situation may have slipped out of our </p><p>control." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
