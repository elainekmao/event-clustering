<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000540 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: RECENT CHURCH ACTIVISM INCLUDING MEDIATION OFFER </p><p>BY CAPETOWN ARCHBISHOP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 323 </p><p>     B. HARARE 159 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) In recent weeks church leaders, including some from </p><p>South Africa, have shown an increased willingness to speak </p><p>out, and to organize events or meetings that draw attention </p><p>to the political crisis in Zimbabwe.  We would welcome </p><p>Pretoria\'s and Capetown\'s assessment of a serious mediation </p><p>initiative by the Archbishop of Capetown.  The GOZ has </p><p>responded in force to increased assertiveness by Zimbabwean </p><p>clergy arresting, detaining, threatening and in one case </p><p>beating a clergy member.  Though threatened, so far their </p><p>activism has been a winning strategy.  It is unclear how long </p><p>the GOZ will allow clergy members that little extra room to </p><p>express dissent and mobilize parishioners, but their </p><p>increased activism certainly poses a dilemma for the GOZ. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>South African Archbishop Intervenes </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) On March 12 the Anglican Archbishop of Capetown </p><p>Njongonkulu Ndungane made his second visit to Zimbabwe in </p><p>recent weeks and met separately with President Mugabe, MDC </p><p>leader Morgan Tsvangirai, church leaders, and an range of </p><p>prominent civic organizations.  Although the GOZ press </p><p>insists that Ndungane is mediating between the GOZ and the </p><p>UK, the Archbishop has made clear in both his public remarks </p><p>and private meetings that Zimbabwe is facing a number of </p><p>internal crises that must be resolved.  Both civil society </p><p>leaders and the MDC were impressed by the Archbishop\'s </p><p>understanding of events on the ground and the seriousness and </p><p>objectivity he seemed to bring to his offer to mediate a </p><p>sustainable resolution of Zimbabwe\'s political and economic </p><p>crises.  In response to Ndungane\'s request, the MDC tapped </p><p>Secretary General Welshman Ncube to be the point person for </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>this mediation effort.  We were unable to meet with Ndungane </p><p>and would welcome Pretoria\'s and Capetown\'s assessment of his </p><p>initiative. </p><p> </p><p>19 Clergy Arrested While Delivering Petition </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>4. (U) Meanwhile, Zimbabwean church leaders are becoming more </p><p>outspoken in their criticisms of political violence.  On </p><p>February 28 nineteen clergy members from the Zimbabwe </p><p>National Pastors\' Conference (ZNPC) were arrested and </p><p>detained for five hours in Harare when they tried to deliver </p><p>a petition to Assistant Police Commissioner Mandeya (who had </p><p>agreed beforehand to accept the petition) which urged the </p><p>police force to respect the rights of all Zimbabweans.  As </p><p>they approached the police station carrying wooden crosses </p><p>they were surrounded by police in riot gear who banged batons </p><p>on their trucks and sang, "It\'s been a long time since you </p><p>were beaten" in Shona.  In a public statement, the Crisis in </p><p>Zimbabwe Coalition, of which ZNPC is one of 350 member </p><p>organizations, condemned the arrest and called for an </p><p>immediate return to the rule of law. </p><p> </p><p>Prayer Meeting Highlights Victims of Torture </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) On February 27 Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bulawayo </p><p>Pius Ncube led a prayer service that featured victims of </p><p>torture at St. Mary\'s Cathedral in Bulawayo.  Deborah Moyo </p><p>gave a heart wrenching account, before collapsing with </p><p>emotion, of her repeated gang rape by fellow recruits and </p><p>superiors at a GOZ-sponsored Border Gezi youth training camp. </p><p> MDC MP Job Sikhala described his January 14 torture in which </p><p>suspected CIO members administered on him electric shocks and </p><p>urinated on him (Ref B). After the meeting, CIO officers </p><p>approached and attempted to arrest Archbishop Ncube, but </p><p>fellow ministers and bishops remained with him, offering some </p><p>protection as witnesses.  CIO officers left, but returned the </p><p>following day, as did Ncube\'s supporting clergy; the officers </p><p>warned Ncube that the previous day\'s meeting was too </p><p>political.  Ncube sleeps in different safe houses every </p><p>night, but is worried about his elderly mother, whom CIO </p><p>officers have also threatened. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On February 24 Archbishop Ncube led a protest at the </p><p>Bulawayo cricket grounds just prior to the Cricket World Cup </p><p>match between Australia and Zimbabwe.  In a statement Ncube </p><p>criticized the Australian team for being unsympathetic to the </p><p>plight of ordinary Zimbabweans by playing the match. </p><p> </p><p>Bishop Speaks Out Against POSA </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>7. (U) In a late February statement entitled "POSA, an </p><p>Unnecessary Evil Instrument and Totally Undemocratic", Dr. </p><p>Sebastian Bakare, the Anglican Bishop of Manicaland and </p><p>President of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, said he felt </p><p>horrified to live in a community where people cannot engage </p><p>in development programs for fear of being arrested.  He said </p><p>that as long as the draconian Public Order and Security Act </p><p>(POSA) is in force there is no chance for desperately needed </p><p>political dialogue to address the polarized environment in </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>"Walk for Love" Ends With One Clergy Beaten </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>8. (U) On February 14 police arrested 14 people in Bulawayo, </p><p>and about 50 in Harare during Valentine\'s Day "walks for </p><p>love" organized by Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) that drew </p><p>hundreds of participants in each city.  Most of the arrestees </p><p>were women, but one clergyman, Fr. Nigel Johnson of the Roman </p><p>Catholic Church in Bulawayo, was also arrested.  Witnesses </p><p>reported that police handcuffed and then applied a chokehold </p><p>on Johnson until he passed out and fell to the pavement. </p><p>Later, at Bulawayo police station he was reportedly okay, </p><p>albeit bruised and shaken up; the Bulawayo women, some </p><p>elderly, spent the night in police cells.  The Crisis in </p><p>Zimbabwe Coalition condemned the arrests and beating and </p><p>called for a repeal of POSA, under which the arrests were </p><p>made. </p><p> </p><p>ZRP Stymies Church Meeting - Emboff Detained </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>9. (U) On February 13 Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition organized </p><p>a public meeting at the Northside Community Church in </p><p>Borrowdale, Harare under the theme, "Is the Church Resolving </p><p>or Deepening the Crisis" to have been addressed by Bishop </p><p>Trevor Manhanga of the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe. </p><p>Police broke up the meeting before it started, chasing away </p><p>30 or so people who had gathered.  Police punched in the face </p><p>a well-known political scientist Dr. John Makumbe while he </p><p>was handcuffed, and arrested 6 people including Bishop </p><p>Manhanga, Makumbe and an Emboff (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>11. (C) Some church leaders are becoming more active, and </p><p>more outspoken and the GOZ is matching their activism with an </p><p>equivalent show of force.  So far their activism is a winning </p><p>game.  But it is unclear how long the GOZ will allow clergy </p><p>members that little extra room to express dissent and </p><p>mobilize parishioners, and their increased activism certainly </p><p>poses a dilemma for the GOZ.  We are encouraged by the </p><p>seriousness of Archbishop Ndungane\'s mediation efforts; what </p><p>they are able to accomplish will depend in large measure on </p><p>Mugabe\'s willingness to discuss internal issues, as opposed </p><p>to his usual bogeyman; the GOZ-UK relationship.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
