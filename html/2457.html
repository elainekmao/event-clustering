<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000387 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF/W, E FOR APENCE, NSC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PROPOSED POST-JEPC BILATERAL ECONOMIC </p><p>COMMITTEE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This cable contains an action request in para 14. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. During extensive discussions with GON officials late last </p><p>year and throughout this month, including the President\'s </p><p>Chief Economic Advisor (CEA), we have reached general </p><p>agreement on a way forward on a post-JEPC arrangement.  This </p><p>new arrangement mixes elements of a new approach to economic </p><p>cooperation with those elements of the former JEPC that </p><p>should be continued.  The JEPC focused almost exclusively on </p><p>discussions regarding policy and institutional reform.  This </p><p>top-down perspective remains a major component of the new </p><p>model.  However, to stimulate actual business ventures and </p><p>activities that demonstrate the benefits of reform, the new </p><p>model weds the top-down with a bottom-up approach.  Under </p><p>this complementary arrangement, the proposed Economic </p><p>Committee would form working groups on non-oil trade, direct </p><p>investment, agricultural infrastructure and energy to </p><p>identify and facilitate discrete projects and activities. </p><p>This structure would require the identification of feasible </p><p>projects/activities and would wed this identification to a </p><p>focus on problem-solving in order to turn the feasible into </p><p>actual progress on the ground. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. To effectuate this new approach, the working groups would </p><p>meet more frequently than the full Committee in order to </p><p>achieve substantive progress on the concrete objectives in </p><p>the enumerated sector.  The Committee could meet </p><p>periodically, for example, semi-annually or annually, while </p><p>the working groups would convene as appropriate, perhaps </p><p>monthly in Abuja and quarterly with some or all Washington </p><p>participants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Time and Place </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The initial meeting of the Lead Committee has been </p><p>proposed for April 16-17 or May 7-8, 2002.  Both sides agree </p><p>to hold the first meeting in Washington to best serve the </p><p>goal of maximizing high-level U.S. government and private </p><p>sector participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>The Process </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The Mission and GON have basically outlined the following </p><p>sequence of preparations for the Washington session. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- First, we have informally constituted a U.S.-GON </p><p>preparatory committee comprised of U.S. Mission elements </p><p>(Pol/Econ and USAID) and GON officials (CEA office, Commerce </p><p>Ministry, Vice President\'s office). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Second, with Washington\'s assent, the Embassy will draft a </p><p>working paper that outlines the concepts of the new JEPC. </p><p>This paper will be shared with GON members of the preparatory </p><p>committee and is intended to memorialize our mutual agreement </p><p>to the new approach and to serve as the foundation for </p><p>further preparations.  The working paper will exactly mirror </p><p>the information contained in this cable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Third, after the GON endorses the working paper, the </p><p>preparatory committee will hold meetings on the particular </p><p>working groups to be recommended to the Lead Committee in </p><p>Washington.  For each working group, the preparatory </p><p>committee will develop papers containing recommendations </p><p>focusing on the projects for the working group and </p><p>composition of the working group, i.e., what U.S. and Nigeria </p><p>agencies will be members of which groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Fourth, the deliberations of the preparatory committee </p><p>will also develop recommendations on the agenda and make-up </p><p>of the delegation to the Lead Committee meeting. </p><p>Additionally, it will make recommendations regarding private </p><p>sector and state and local government participation in the </p><p>Lead Committee sessions and for the working groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Fifth, the Lead Committee will meet.  The Lead Committee </p><p>is exactly what the name suggests -- it is the committee that </p><p>provides overall policy guidance and the bureaucratic muscle </p><p>needed to make this approach work.  It is the Lead Committee </p><p>that tasks the working groups and from which these working </p><p>groups get their mandate.  As such, the Lead Committee will </p><p>discuss the framework issues of investment, trade, </p><p>agriculture and energy, providing policy direction on how </p><p>these issues should be pursued within the working groups. </p><p>The Lead Committee will also discuss and approve/reject the </p><p>recommendations made by the preparatory committee regarding </p><p>the membership and mandate of the working groups, the </p><p>projects/activities for each group and private sector and </p><p>state government participation in the working group. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Five Working Groups </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The Mission and GON have preliminarily agreed to suggest </p><p>five working groups to the Lead Committee.  For each working </p><p>group, the Committee would identify specific activities or </p><p>case studies.  For example, the Investment Working Group may </p><p>be tasked with the case study of helping to revive the </p><p>textile industry in Kano through domestic, U.S. or perhaps </p><p>other foreign investment.  By identifying obstacles to </p><p>bringing in U.S. investment in textiles, the working group </p><p>would develop solutions to problems in Kano as well as </p><p>determine if these solutions have more general application in </p><p>the Nigerian economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Each working group would have a core group of members from </p><p>both the Nigerian and U.S. sides that would participate in </p><p>all activities of that working group.  Also, each group would </p><p>have ancillary members agencies and persons who might be </p><p>called to attend particular working group sessions dealing </p><p>with an issues within that agency\'s or person\'s ken.  The </p><p>five suggested working groups are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Investment in Non-Oil Sectors </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. This working group would focus on identifying and bringing </p><p>to fruition actual non-oil direct investment.  Possibilities </p><p>for this working group include investment in Kano\'s textile </p><p>sector, Kaduna\'s solid minerals sector, and Nigeria\'s housing </p><p>sector.  The core working group would include the State </p><p>Department, USAID and Department of Commerce on the U.S. </p><p>side.  The Office of the Vice President, Office of the Chief </p><p>Economic Advisor, Ministry of Commerce and Nigerian </p><p>Investment Promotion Council would form the core elements on </p><p>the Nigerian side.  To address a specific objective, such as </p><p>Kano\'s textile sector, TDA, OPIC and EXIM might be involved </p><p>on the U.S. side while the Kano State government would be </p><p>involved on the Nigerian side. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Investment in Nigeria\'s housing sector is another specific </p><p>objective that could be tasked to this working group.  The </p><p>lack of sufficient low- and medium-income housing in urban </p><p>areas has become a major political issue for the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration.  Providing relief in this area would have a </p><p>positive impact on the lives of average Nigerians and be </p><p>viewed as a demonstrable \'democracy dividend\'.  TDA is </p><p>currently reviewing a proposal to conduct a feasibility study </p><p>on developing a secondary mortgage financing market.  Based </p><p>on the study\'s recommendations, the working group could </p><p>assemble the know-how and provide impetus to move this </p><p>project forward.  In addition to the core working group </p><p>participants, others working the housing issue might include </p><p>Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, OPIC and TDA on the U.S. side and the </p><p>Ministry of Works and Housing on the Nigerian side. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Bilateral Trade </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The Committee might establish a working group to </p><p>encourage the export of specific goods under AGOA, such as </p><p>footwear or leather.  To support this objective, the Embassy </p><p>has $750,000 in ESF committed to conduct AGOA-related </p><p>feasibility studies.  These feasibility studies will support </p><p>investment in industries that benefit from AGOA and could </p><p>lead to the development of products for export.  Core working </p><p>group participants would include State, USAID, Commerce and </p><p>USTR on the U.S. side and the Office of the CEA, Office of </p><p>the Vice President, Ministry of Commerce and Export Promotion </p><p>Council on the Nigerian side.  Sectoral manufacturing </p><p>associations would be included in the working group on an </p><p>issue-specific basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Agriculture Infrastructure </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. This committee would deal with non-trade, agriculture </p><p>issues.  To develop the agriculture sector, Nigeria must </p><p>improve its agriculture infrastructure, such as feeder rural </p><p>roads, increase capacity and productivity, pursue </p><p>opportunities in biotechnology, and explore commodity trading </p><p>and price stabilization methods.  Core working group </p><p>participants would include State, USAID and USDA on the U.S. </p><p>side with the Office of the CEA, Office of the Vice President </p><p>and Ministry of Agriculture on the Nigerian side.  The </p><p>Ministry of Science and Technology would be included in </p><p>discussions regarding biotechnology.  Additional working </p><p>sub-groups may be included to address financial issues </p><p>related to commodity trading and price stabilization </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Energy </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Energy comprises the largest commercial component of the </p><p>U.S.-Nigeria relationship.  This working group would address </p><p>bilateral energy issues as they arise.  Specific topics might </p><p>include Nigeria\'s oil exports to the U.S., deregulation and </p><p>privatization of the power industry, opportunities for U.S. </p><p>investment in power production and oil refining, and problems </p><p>U.S. energy companies may be experiencing in Nigeria.  Core </p><p>working group members would include State, USAID, and </p><p>Department of Energy on the U.S. side with the Office of the </p><p>CEA, the Office of the President, the Ministry of Power and </p><p>Steel and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on </p><p>the Nigerian side.  Additional working group participants </p><p>would be invited on an as needed basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Policy Reform and Implementation </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. This working group would deal primarily with policy </p><p>issues that arise from the other four working groups.  For </p><p>example, if the Investment Working Group decided that a </p><p>specific customs regulation governing the importation of </p><p>cotton or yarn was prohibiting foreign investment, not just </p><p>for this project but more generally in the textile sector, </p><p>the Policy Reform Working Group would be informed and tasked </p><p>with pushing that particular regulatory change through the </p><p>national bureaucracy.  It would also look at economic policy </p><p>problems generated by the Lead Committee and private sector </p><p>that cannot be properly addressed by other working groups. </p><p>The participants will coordinate and implement policy reforms </p><p>needed to achieve the specific objectives identified by the </p><p>Economic Committee.  Core working group members would include </p><p>State and USAID on the U.S. side and the Office of the CEA </p><p>and Office of the Vice President on the Nigerian side. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  Action requested: Post requests the Department\'s </p><p>approval of this amended concept for the U.S.-Nigerian </p><p>Economic Committee.  Once we have received Washington\'s </p><p>approval, we will forward the working paper to the GON. </p><p>Simultaneously, we will engage in a conversation with the GON </p><p>and Washington that, as the process unfolds, will determine </p><p>the specific agenda for the Lead Committee meeting as well as </p><p>the specific role the USG agencies and the U.S. private </p><p>sector, including the CCA, will have at the Lead Committee </p><p>meeting and beyond. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
