CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE 1980\'S HAVE WITNESSED A GRADUAL REALIGNMENT IN </p><p>THE BALANCE OF POWER AMONG KUWAIT\'S FOUR MAJOR FAMILY </p><p>GROUPS:  THE RULING AL-SABAH, THE SUNNI AND SHIA </p><p>MERCHANT ARISTOCRACIES, AND THE JENAAT (IRAQI-ORIGIN </p><p>SUNNI).  THE AL-SABAH HAVE BEEN THE MAJOR BENEFICIARIES, </p><p>AS THEY HAVE SOLIDIFIED THEIR HOLD ON GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>EXPANDED THEIR PRESENCE IN FINANCE AND COMMERCE.  THE </p><p>JENAAT WERE FORCED INTO CLOSER ALLIANCE WITH THE AL-SABAH </p><p>FOLLOWING THE 1982 STOCK MARKET CRASH, AS THE RULING </p><p>FAMILY HELPED EXTRACT THEM FROM THEIR FINANCIAL DIFFI- </p><p>CULTIES.  THE SHIAS FOLLOWED A SIMILAR COURSE AS THEIR </p><p>COMMERCIAL TIES TO IRAN CRUMBLED DURING THE GULF WAR. </p><p>THE SUNNIS, WHILE STILL RETAINING GREAT WEALTH AND </p><p>PRESTIGE, HAVE BEEN HOBBLED BY INTRAMURAL SQUABBLING OVER </p><p>HOW TO DIVIDE THE STAGNANT ECONOMIC PIE AVAILABLE TO </p><p>THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AS A RESULT OF THIS REALIGNMENT OF POWER, THERE ARE </p><p>FEWER CHECKS ON THE AL-SABAH ABILITY TO MAKE AND IMPLE- </p><p>MENT GOVERNMENT POLICIES.  THIS SHOULD NOT CAUSE ANY </p><p>MAJOR SHIFTS IN FOREIGN POLICY, AS THE RULING FAMILY IS </p><p>BASICALLY PRO-WESTERN.  ALTHOUGH RELATIVELY CONSERVATIVE, </p><p>IT IS NOT PRONE TO EXTREMISM OF ANY STRIPE AND MONOLITHIC </p><p>ONLY ON ISSUES OF SURVIVAL.  DOMESTICALLY, WE MAY SEE A </p><p>GREATER PROCLIVITY FOR THE AL-SABAH TO ASSERT THEIR RULE </p><p>OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF OTHER SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY (THE </p><p>RECENT UNIVERSITY SHAKE-UP COULD BE AN INITIAL HARBINGER </p><p>OF THIS TREND).  ALTHOUGH THE TRADITION OF PLURALISTIC </p><p>DECISION MAKING IS STILL STRONG AND KUWAIT IS NOT ABOUT TO </p><p>BECOME AN AUTARCHY, THE GREATER CONCENTRATION OF POWER </p><p>IN THE HANDS OF THE RULING FAMILY COULD SET THE STAGE FOR </p><p>FURTHER DEMOCRATIZATION OF KUWAITI SOCIETY.  (THIS CABLE </p><p>FULFILLS PART OF POST REPORTING PLAN.)  END SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY:  PRAGMATISM THE WATCHWORD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>4.  THE ORIGINS OF KUWAIT\'S SOCIAL STRUCTURE DATE TO THE </p><p>FOUNDING OF THE STATE IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. </p><p>TRADITION HAS IT THAT THE FOUNDING FAMILIES CHOSE ONE OF </p><p>THEIR NUMBER, AL-SABAH, TO HEAD THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>"MIND THE STORE" WHILE THE REMAINING FAMILIES PURSUED </p><p>BUSINESS INTERESTS.  DEPENDING ON WHO IS TELLING THE </p><p>STORY, THIS WAS EITHER BECAUSE THE AL-SABAH HAD SHOWN A </p><p>FLAIR FOR MEDIATION, OR BECAUSE THEY WERE THE WEAKEST OF </p><p>THE FOUNDING FAMILIES AND SO WERE GIVEN THE SHORTEST </p><p>(I.E., MOST UNPROFITABLE) END OF THE STICK.  EVEN TODAY </p><p>THE AL-SABAH REFER TO THEMSELVES AS THE "RULING", RATHER </p><p>THAN THE "ROYAL", FAMILY, REFLECTING THE TRADITION OF </p><p>BEING FIRST AMONG EQUALS.  THE OTHER FOUNDING FAMILIES </p><p>FORM THE CORE OF THE SUNNI MERCHANT ARISTOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MEMBERSHIP IN THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY HAS BEEN FAR FROM </p><p>STATIC, AS SUNNI FAMILIES WHO MIGRATED TO KUWAIT OVER THE </p><p>YEARS HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED INTO IT.  FINANCIAL ACUMEN, </p><p>WEALTH AND GULF SUNNI BACKGROUND HAVE BEEN THE TICKETS OF </p><p>ADMISSION.  ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY, </p><p>KUWAIT INVESTMENT AUTHORITY (KIA) MANAGING DIRECTOR DR. </p><p>FAHAD AL-RASHED, RECENTLY REMINDED THE AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>EMBOFF THAT HIS GRANDFATHER HAD WALKED BAREFOOT OUT OF A </p><p>POOR NEJDI VILLAGE IN SAUDI ARABIA (ZILFI) IN THE EARLY </p><p>TWENTIETH CENTURY SEEKING HIS FORTUNE IN THE CITY-STATE </p><p>TO THE NORTHEAST.  THE FOUNDERS OF THE AL-HAMAD, </p><p>AL-KHORAFI, AL-SHAYA, AL-OSAIMI, AND AL-SAAD </p><p>ARISTOCRATIC FAMILIES DID LIKEWISE.  EVEN SOME LONGER </p><p>ESTABLISHED FAMILIES LIKE THE AL-ABDULRAZZAKS GAINED </p><p>WEALTH AND POWER ONLY RECENTLY.  THE CURRENT PATRIARCH </p><p>OF THE FAMILY TOLD EMBOFF DURING A DIWANIYA CALL THAT AS </p><p>A YOUTH HE WORKED AS A WELL-DIGGER, WHEREAS TODAY HE </p><p>COUNTS THE FAMILY WEALTH IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF </p><p>DOLLARS. </p><p>- </p><p>6.  THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY SPREADS ITS INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THROUGH A SERIES OF INTERLOCKING </p><p>DIRECTORATES CENTERED ON THE NATIONAL BANK OF KUWAIT </p><p>(NBK), THE SUNNI FLAGSHIP.  ITS MANAGERS MAINTAIN THAT </p><p>NBK IS THE MOST PROFITABLE OF THE ARAB BANKS AND HOPE IT </p><p>WILL SOMEDAY OVERTAKE ITS CLOSEST RIVALS, NCB OF SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA AND ABC OF BAHRAIN, TO BECOME THE BIGGEST ARAB </p><p>BANK IN TERMS OF ASSETS.  THE ARISTOCRACY\'S EXECUTIVE </p><p>TALENT HAS ALSO LONG BEEN PUT TO USE IN HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>GOVERNMENT POSITIONS.  TWO EXAMPLES WILL SUFFICE TO </p><p>INDICATE THE BREADTH OF THE ARISTOCRACY\'S INFLUENCE: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE BILLIONAIRE NBK CHAIRMAN, MOHAMMED ABDULMOHSEN </p><p>AL-KHORAFI, HAS A SON WHO IS MINISTER OF FINANCE, A </p><p>COUSIN WHO IS UNDERSECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, AND CLOSE </p><p>RELATIVES WHO CONTROL THE SUCCESSFUL KUWAITI SAFEWAYS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE THREE SONS OF THE NBK DEPUTY CHAIRMAN MOHAMED </p><p>ABDUL RAHMAN AL-BAHAR ARE THE CHAIRMEN OF KUWAIT INTER- </p><p>NATIONAL INVESTMENT COMPANY, THE LARGEST PRIVATE </p><p>INVESTMENT COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY; THE KUWAIT INVESTMENT </p><p>COMPANY, THE SECOND LARGEST GOK-OWNED INVESTMENT COMPANY; </p><p>AND THE MANAGER OF A MAJOR IMPORT COMPANY WHICH, AMONG </p><p>OTHER THINGS, HAS THE LOCAL CATERPILLAR CONCESSION.  ONE </p><p>OF THE ELDER AL-BAHAR\'S BROTHERS IS THE OFFICE DIRECTOR </p><p>FOR THE CROWN PRINCE, A NEPHEW IS ON THE BOARD OF GULF </p><p>BANK, AND A COUSIN IS ON THE BOARD OF COMMERCIAL BANK. </p><p>- </p><p>7.  THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY HISTORICALLY WAS CONSIDERED A </p><p>LIBERALIZING COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE </p><p>AL-SABAH.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE 1920\'S AND 1930\'S, THE </p><p>MERCHANTS PRESSED (UNSUCCESSFULLY) FOR A MEANINGFUL </p><p>LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TO CHECK THE EXECUTIVE POWER OF THE </p><p>AL-SABAH.  AT LEAST IN RECENT DECADES, THEIR MOTIVATION </p><p>FOR INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS HAS NOT BEEN BORN OF </p><p>IDEOLOGY, BUT RATHER OF A DESIRE TO MAINTAIN A POLITICAL </p><p>AND BUSINESS CLIMATE CONDUCIVE TO CONTINUED PROFIT- </p><p>MAKING.  THUS, THE DISSOLUTION OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>IN 1976 WAS NOT OPPOSED BY THE ARISTOCRACY, SINCE THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY\'S POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WERE, IF ANYTHING, </p><p>HARMING THE COMMERCIAL CLIMATE.  TODAY, THE MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE ARISTOCRACY REPRESENT A MULTIPLICITY OF VIEWS ON </p><p>PURELY POLITICAL QUESTIONS.  THE ONE POLICY GOAL THEY </p><p>SHARE IS AVOIDANCE OF ANY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, OR SE- </p><p>CURITY PROBLEM WHICH COULD HURT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE </p><p>MONEY; FOR THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY, PRAGMATISM IS THE </p><p>WATCHWORD. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>THE SHIA ARISTOCRACY:  COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE SUNNI </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>8.  THE SHIA ARISTOCRACY IS COMPOSED OF THREE FAMILIES </p><p>WHO MIGRATED TO KUWAIT FROM IRAN AND IRAQ BETWEEN 1850 </p><p>AND 1900:  THE BEHBEHANIS (INCLUDING THE AL-ABULHASSANS </p><p>AND THE AL-MAARAFIS); THE AL-KAZEMIS; AND THE QABAZARDS. </p><p>THE BEHBEHANIS AND THE AL-KAZEMI CLAIM ARABIC ANCESTRY, </p><p>BUT MOST KUWAITIS CONSIDER ALL OF THE SHIA ARISTOCRATS </p><p>TO BE OF PERSIAN STOCK.  LIKE THE SUNNI ARISTOCRATS, </p><p>THEY HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR STATUS BY VIRTUE  OF ACCUMULATED </p><p>WEALTH AND FINANCIAL ACUMEN, AND HAVE EMPLOYED THEIR </p><p>EXECUTIVE TALENT IN GOK POSITIONS.  THEIR BUSINESS </p><p>ACTIVITY IS CENTERED AROUND THE AL-AHLI BANK, WHICH THEY </p><p>CONTROL, AND THEIR GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT AROUND THE </p><p>OIL INDUSTRY, HIGHER EDUCATION, AND THE MEDIA. </p><p>- </p><p>9.  THE SHIA ARISTOCRACY HAS LONG BEEN USED BY THE AL- </p><p>SABAH AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO SUNNI DOMINANCE OF COMMERCE </p><p>AND FINANCE AND AS A CONNECTION TO IRAN.  THE SHIA </p><p>ABDULMUTALIB AL-KAZEMI, OIL MINISTER FROM 1975 TO 1978, </p><p>PRESIDED OVER THE NATIONALIZATION OF KUWAIT\'S OIL INDUS- </p><p>TRY, WHICH CREATED A NEW SOURCE OF WEALTH AND POWER FOR </p><p>THE AL-SABAH INDEPENDENT OF THE SUNNI ARISTOCRATS.  SHIA </p><p>ARISTOCRATS HAVE CONTINUED TO FILL MANAGEMENT POSITIONS </p><p>IN THE OIL INDUSTRY.  THE AMIR ALSO REPORTEDLY USED </p><p>AL-AHLI BANK AS HIS CONDUIT FOR FINANCIAL RELATIONS </p><p>WITH IRAN DURING THE REIGN OF THE SHAH.  BY THE START OF </p><p>THE 1980\'S, THE SHIA ARISTOCRATS AND THE AL-SABAH ENJOYED </p><p>A SYMBIOTIC WORKING RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH EACH SIDE </p><p>HELPED THE OTHER REMAIN INDEPENDENT OF THE SUNNI </p><p>MERCHANTS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE JENAAT:  WESTERN-ORIENTED NOUVEAU-RICHE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>10.  THE JENAAT ARE A GROUP OF SUNNI FAMILIES, MORE </p><p>PROPERLY A CLAN, WHICH MIGRATED TO KUWAIT FROM NORTHERN </p><p>IRAQ IN THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY.  THE CLAN INCLUDES THE </p><p>AL-MUTAWA, AL-SALEH, AL-SURI, AL-SULTAN, AL-ISSA, </p><p>AL-BADR, AL-MUSALLEM, AL-NAJI, AL-JASSEM, AND THE </p><p>AL-YASSEEN FAMILIES.  THE JENAAT NUMBER WELL OVER 10,000 </p><p>AND ARE KUWAIT\'S LARGEST FAMILY GROUP.  WHILE MOST WEAR </p><p>TRADITIONAL KUWAITI DRESS, THEIR FAIR COMPLEXION, </p><p>INCLUDING SOME BLONDS, GIVES THEM A DISTINCTLY EUROPEAN </p><p>APPEARANCE.  THEY MARRY ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN THE </p><p>FAMILY (WHEN MARRYING KUWAITIS), AND HAVE KEPT THEIR </p><p>DISTANCE FROM THE OTHER SUNNI FAMILIES. </p><p>- </p><p>11.  THE JENAAT RISE TO PROMINENCE DATES FROM THE EARLY </p><p>PART OF THIS CENTURY WHEN THE AL-SABAH ADOPTED THE JENAAT </p><p>ORPHAN YUSIF AL-ISSA.  YUSIF GREW UP IN THE AL-SABAH </p><p>HOUSEHOLD AND SOLIDIFIED HIS TIES WITH THE RULING FAMILY </p><p>WHEN HE SERVED ON THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL IN THE 1930\'S </p><p>AND DEFENDED THE AMIR AGAINST ITS ATTEMPTS TO DILUTE HIS </p><p>AUTHORITY.  YUSIF INSISTED THAT EACH OF HIS TWELVE SONS </p><p>RECEIVE A FIRST-RATE EDUCATION IN THE U.S. OR UK, AND A </p><p>CONTINUING FAMILY EMPHASIS ON QUALITY EDUCATION HAS </p><p>CAUSED A HIGHER PROPORTION OF JENAAT THAN OTHER KUWAITIS </p><p>TO HAVE WESTERN BUSINESS DEGREES (AND WESTERN WIVES).  IT </p><p>HAS ALSO LED THE JENAAT TO SUPPLY MANY OF THE PROFESSIONAL </p><p>AND TECHNICAL EXPERTS NEEDED BY KUWAITI PRIVATE COMPANIES </p><p>AND THE GOK-OWNED OIL CONCERNS, ALTHOUGH IN THE 1960\'S </p><p>CLAN MEMBERS BEGAN TO MOVE INTO OWNERSHIP POSITIONS WITH </p><p>THE HELP OF THE JENAAT-CONTROLLED GULF BANK.  REFLECTIVE </p><p>OF THE RANGE OF JENAAT EXPERIENCE AND OPINION IS THE </p><p>PROMINENCE OF SOME CLAN MEMBERS AMONG KUWAITIS COMMITTED </p><p>TO "PAN-ARAB" CAUSES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY </p><p>AND THE JENAAT.  THE SUNNI MERCHANTS CONSIDER THE JENAAT </p><p>"NOUVEAU RICHE" WHO TRADED ON YUSIF\'S CONNECTION WITH THE </p><p>AL-SABAH TO MAKE INROADS INTO COMMERCE AND FINANCE.  THE </p><p>JENAAT, IN TURN, ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED THE MOST ANTI- </p><p>SHIA KUWAITIS, PROBABLY BECAUSE THE SHIA ARE SEEN AS </p><p>RIVALS FOR THE FAVOR OF THE AL-SABAH AND FOR MANAGEMENT </p><p>POSITIONS WITHIN THE OIL INDUSTRY.  THE JENAAT DO HAVE A </p><p>STRONG POSITION WITHIN THE OIL INDUSTRY -- OIL MINISTER </p><p>SHAIKH ALI-KHALIFA AL-SABAH IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS </p><p>THE "JENAAT SHAIKH" BECAUSE OF HIS RELIANCE ON THEIR </p><p>TALENTS -- BUT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN INDICATION THAT THE </p><p>AL-SABAH WOULD FOREGO THEIR CONNECTION TO THE SHIA </p><p>ARISTOCRACY AT THE BEHEST OF THE JENAAT.  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>JENAAT HAVE CARVED OUT AN IMPORTANT POSITION AS A </p><p>WESTERN-ORIENTED TECHNOCRATIC ELITE, THEY HAVE NEVER </p><p>REACHED A POSITION WHERE THEY COULD INDEPENDENTLY </p><p>CHALLENGE THE SUNNI OR SHIA ESTABLISHMENTS. </p><p>- </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>SOUK AL-MANAKH CRASH:  A WATERSHED FOR THE JENAAT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>13.  BY 1980, THE FOUR MAJOR FAMILY GROUPS HAD ACHIEVED </p><p>A CAREFUL BALANCE OF POWER.  THIS BALANCE WAS SOON TO BE </p><p>UPSET.  THE FIRST SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM WAS THE 1982 SOUK </p><p>AL-MANAKH STOCK MARKET CRASH, IN WHICH THE JENAAT LOST A </p><p>LOT OF MONEY AND A GREAT DEAL OF PRESTIGE.  JENAAT </p><p>MEMBERS, PARTICULARLY THE AL-MUTAWA, WERE INVOLVED IN </p><p>SOME OF THE BIGGEST FAILED DEALS WHICH SPARKED THE CRASH, </p><p>AND THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY TRIED TO BLAME THE CRASH ON THE </p><p>UNBRIDLED GREED OF THE JENAAT.  THERE WERE ALSO </p><p>ACCUSATIONS THAT THE HEAD OF THE CLAN, MUSTAFA AL-SULTAN, </p><p>USED HIS POSITION AS HEAD OF GULF BANK TO PROTECT THE </p><p>CLAN\'S WEALTH BY BLOCKING ACCOUNTS OF MANAKH PLAYERS </p><p>WHO WERE IN DEBT TO IT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE JENAAT\'S PROBLEMS AFTER THE MANAKH DISASTER GAVE </p><p>THE AL-SABAH AN OPENING TO AUGMENT THEIR RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH THE CLAN, AS THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY TURNED TO THE </p><p>GOK TO RESCUE KUWAIT\'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM.  THE RULING </p><p>FAMILY MADE THE MOST OF THIS OPPORTUNITY.  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER AT THE TIME WAS A SUNNI ARISTOCRAT WHO </p><p>FAVORED LETTING THE MANAKH CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY, </p><p>THE GOK DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT A BAIL-OUT OF THE BANKS AND </p><p>DEBTORS MOST AFFECTED BY THE CRASH.  THERE WERE EVEN </p><p>CHARGES THAT THE AL-SABAH AND JENAAT HAD CONSPIRED TO </p><p>SETTLE UNFAIRLY A NUMBER OF THE CLAIMS RESULTING FROM </p><p>THE CRASH. </p><p>- </p><p>15.  WHATEVER THE PROPRIETY OF THEIR ACTIONS, THE AL- </p><p>SABAH MANAGED TO PUT MANY OF THE JENAAT IN THEIR DEBT, </p><p>BOTH FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY, AND EXTEND THEIR PRE- </p><p>VIOUSLY LIMITED PARTICIPATION IN JENAAT BUSINESS </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, AN AL-SABAH </p><p>WAS NAMED TO THE BOARD OF THE GULF BANK AFTER THE BANK\'S </p><p>SOLVENCY WAS RESTORED BY THE GOK.  THE JENAAT ARE </p><p>WIDELY SEEN AS HAVING SURVIVED THE MARKET COLLAPSE DUE </p><p>IN LARGE PART TO AL-SABAH PATRONAGE, AND TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>FORCED INTO CLOSER ALLIANCE WITH THE RULING FAMILY AS A </p><p>RESULT.  THE AL-SABAH, MEANWHILE, MANAGED TO SURVIVE THE </p><p>POLITICAL CRISIS CAUSED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE BAIL-OUT PROGRAM AND ITS SUBSEQUENT </p><p>DISSOLUTION, LARGELY BECAUSE THE PRAGMATIC SUNNI </p><p>ARISTOCRACY CAME TO SEE POLITICAL STABILITY AS ESSENTIAL </p><p>TO BUSINESS CONFIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>THE GULF WAR AND THE SHIA ARISTOCRACY </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>16.  WHILE THE JENAAT WERE SWIFTLY WOUNDED BY THE SOUK </p><p>AL-MANAKH CRASH, THE SHIA ARISTOCRACY WERE SLOWLY BLED </p><p>BY THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.  THEY SUFFERED SERIOUS ECONOMIC </p><p>SETBACKS AS LUCRATIVE FINANCIAL LINKS WITH IRAN WERE </p><p>BROKEN AND THE CENTER OF THE TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>IRAN WAS DIVERTED TO DUBAI.  THE SHIA-CONTROLLED AL-AHLI </p><p>BANK FACED SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND HAD TO RECEIVE </p><p>GOK FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO SURVIVE.  AS WAS THE CASE </p><p>WITH GULF BANK, THE AL-SABAH DEMANDED AND RECEIVED A </p><p>SEAT ON THE AL-AHLI BOARD IN RETURN FOR THE GOK BAIL-OUT </p><p>AND AS A SYMBOL OF THE SHIA\'S INCREASED DEPENDENCE ON </p><p>THE RULING FAMILY\'S PATRONAGE. </p><p>- </p><p>17.  MORE SERIOUS FOR THE SHIA ARISTOCRACY THAN THEIR </p><p>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WAS THE QUESTIONING OF THEIR LOYALTY. </p><p>THIS REACHED A PEAK WHEN SHIA WORKERS WERE IMPLICATED IN </p><p>THE SABOTAGE OF THE KPC REFINERY AT AHMADI AND THE </p><p>JENAAT HEAD OF KOTC, ABDULFATAH AL-BADER, BEGAN ARGUING </p><p>THAT KPC SHOULD SACK ALL OF ITS SHIA EMPLOYEES.  OIL </p><p>MINISTER SHAIKH ALI-KHALIFA AL-SABAH AND KPC MARKETING </p><p>DIRECTOR SHAIKH ALI JABER AL-SABAH, THE AMIR\'S SON-IN- </p><p>LAW, BLOCKED ANY PRECIPITATE AXING OF SHIA MANAGERS, </p><p>KEEPING, FOR EXAMPLE, A QABAZARD AS DEPUTY MANAGING </p><p>DIRECTOR OF KOTC.  NEVERTHELESS, THE SHIA ARISTOCRATS </p><p>FELT CONSTRAINED TO KEEP LOW PUBLIC PROFILES AND TO </p><p>PROFESS THEIR LOYALTY TO THE STATE WITH GREAT OSTENTATION </p><p>ON THE DIWANIYA CIRCUIT.  NOW THAT THE WAR HAS WOUND </p><p>DOWN, THE SHIA ARISTOCRATS ARE LEFT WITH MUCH LESS </p><p>FINANCIAL POWER AND A GREATER SENSE OF DEBT TO THE </p><p>AL-SABAH FOR THE PROTECTION AFFORDED DURING THE WAR </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE SUNNI:  DAMAGED FROM WITHOUT AND WITHIN </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>18.  THE SUNNI ARISTOCRATS WHO HAD BEEN MIDDLEMEN IN </p><p>TRADE WITH IRAN AND IRAQ SAW THEIR PROFITS DECLINE DURING </p><p>THE GULF WAR, AS THE NORMAL TRADE AND FINANCIAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE COMBATANTS SHRANK OR WERE DIVERTED </p><p>ELSEWHERE.  THE ARISTOCRACY MANAGED TO SURVIVE BECAUSE </p><p>OF THE SIZE AND DIVERSITY OF THEIR FINANCIAL INTERESTS, </p><p>NBK REMAINS THE ONLY KUWAITI PRIVATE BANK WHICH HAS </p><p>NOT HAD TO TURN TO THE GOK FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE; IT </p><p>STILL HAS NO AL-SABAH ON ITS BOARD.  NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>WAR PUT A DAMPER ON THE GROWTH OF SUNNI ECONOMIC POWER. </p><p>THE PICTURE IS NOT A GREAT DEAL BRIGHTER NOW THAT THE </p><p>SHOOTING HAS CEASED.  IRAQ\'S LACK OF HARD CURRENCY AND </p><p>APPETITE FOR ADDITIONAL CREDIT AND THE GOK\'S REFUSAL TO </p><p>ADVANCE THE CAPITAL WHICH KUWAITI CONTRACTORS NEED TO </p><p>COMPETE FOR MAJOR PROJECTS HAS DASHED THE SUNNI </p><p>ARISTOCRATS HOPES FOR PROFITING QUICKLY FROM POST-WAR </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ.  THE SUNNI MERCHANTS ARE FAR </p><p>FROM PAUPERS, BUT THEIR WEALTH IS NOT GROWING AT THE </p><p>PACE IT ONCE DID. </p><p>- </p><p>19.  THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY\'S PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN </p><p>EXACERBATED BY INTRAMURAL SQUABBLING.  THE ELDEST SON OF </p><p>MULTI-BILLIONAIRE YUSIF AHMED AL-GHANIM, ARGUABLY THE </p><p>RICHEST SUNNI MERCHANT, HAS SPENT MOST OF THE DECADE </p><p>IN THE U.S. DUE TO DIFFERENCES WITH HIS FATHER.  OTHER </p><p>SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY ARE FEUDING FOR VARIOUS </p><p>REASONS.  TWO SUNNI FAMILIES, THE AL-KHALEDS AND AL- </p><p>GHARABALLYS, ARE FIGHTING OVER POTENTIALLY PROFITABLE </p><p>SPONSORSHIP OF THE LOCAL FRENCH SCHOOL.  SIMILAR DISPUTES </p><p>OVER CONTROL OF OTHER PROFITABLE VENTURES HAVE SPRUNG </p><p>UP AS MEMBERS OF THE SUNNI ARISTOCRACY MANEUVER TO </p><p>SECURE SLICES OF A STAGNANT ECONOMIC PIE.  THESE FAMILY </p><p>DIFFERENCES HAMSTRING THE SUNNI AND MEAN THEY CANNOT </p><p>EASILY MOUNT A UNIFIED CAMPAIGN TO RE-ASSERT THEMSELVES </p><p>VIS-A-VIS THE AL-SABAH.  THEY ARE THUS ENDING THE DECADE </p><p>WEAKER THAN THEY ENTERED IT, BOTH FINANCIALLY AND </p><p>POLITICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>THE AL-SABAH INCREASE THEIR FINANCIAL CLOUT ... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>20.  WHILE KUWAIT\'S OTHER THREE FAMILY POWER BLOCS </p><p>SUFFERED ECONOMIC SETBACKS DURING THE 1980\'S, THE </p><p>AL-SABAH WERE AUGMENTING THEIR POWER.  THEY TIED GOK </p><p>FINANCIAL FORTUNES TO OIL REVENUES AND INVESTMENT IN THE </p><p>DEVELOPED WORLD, THEREBY INSULATING THEM FROM THE EFFECTS </p><p>OF THE GULF WAR (WITH NO SMALL HELP FROM THE UNITED </p><p>STATES NAVY).  GOK, AND BY IMPLICATION AL-SABAH, </p><p>FINANCIAL CLOUT THUS WAS STRENGTHENED RELATIVE TO PRIVATE </p><p>KUWAITI INTERESTS. </p><p>- </p><p>21.  AL-SABAH FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>INCREASE THEIR PERSONAL FORTUNES IN THE 1980\'S DUE IN </p><p>PART TO THEIR GOK CONNECTIONS.  THE RICHEST AL-SABAH </p><p>OF ALL MAY BE SHAIKH SALEM AL-ALI AL-SABAH, WHO HEADS </p><p>THE NATIONAL GUARD AND HAS REPORTEDLY AMASSED A FORTUNE </p><p>BY BROKERING ARMS DEALS WITH KUWAIT OR NEIGHBORING ARAB </p><p>STATES.  A QUIET MAN, HIS HUGE, WELL-FURNISHED DIWANIYA </p><p>HAS ALWAYS BEEN EERILY EMPTY EXCEPT FOR FAMILY RETAINERS </p><p>WHENEVER EMBOFFS HAVE DROPPED IN ON EID CALLS.  HIS </p><p>BANK ACCOUNTS, HOWEVER, ARE FAR FROM EMPTY; A LOCAL </p><p>BANKER RECENTLY TOLD EMBOFF THAT SHAIKH SALEM AL-ALI </p><p>HAD ALMOST TWO BILLION RPT BILLION DOLLARS ON DEPOSIT </p><p>IN LOCAL BANKS ALONE, WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM ONE OF THE </p><p>THREE OR FOUR RICHEST KUWAITIS. </p><p> </p><p>22.  THE NET RESULT OF THE CHANGES IN THE 1980\'S HAS </p><p>BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE </p><p>AL-SABAH IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY.  IN THE LATE 1970\'S, THE </p><p>MERCHANTS WERE ABLE TO PUT A MEMBER OF THE AL-SABAH </p><p>OUT OF THE IMPORT BUSINESS BY QUIETLY PASSING THE WORD </p><p>TO THE CROWN PRINCE THAT THE MAN WAS TRESPASSING ONTO </p><p>TERRITORY RESERVED FOR OTHERS, AND THE RULING FAMILY </p><p>HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE IN THE PRIVATE BANKING ESTABLISH- </p><p>MENT.  NOW, THE MERCHANTS WORRY THAT THEY WILL BE </p><p>FORCED TO FIND ROOM IN THEIR BUSINESSES FOR YOUNG </p><p>UNDER-EMPLOYED AL-SABAH, AND THE FAMILY HAS SEATS ON </p><p>THE BOARDS OF THREE OF THE FOUR LARGEST PRIVATE BANKS </p><p>(AL-AHLI, COMMERCIAL, AND GULF).  THE OLD TABOOS HAVE </p><p>BEEN BROKEN, AND THE AL-SABAH ARE CLEARLY FREE TO </p><p>COMPETE WITH THE OTHER FAMILY POWER BLOCS ON THEIR </p><p>OWN TURF. </p><p>- </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>...AND CONSOLIDATE AL-SABAH POLITICAL POWER </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>23.  BEFORE IT WAS SUSPENDED IN 1986, THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN A BRAKE ON AL-SABAH POWER AND A </p><p>VEHICLE BY WHICH THE OTHER FAMILIES COULD PUT THEM </p><p>ON NOTICE WHEN THEIR GRASP EXTENDED TOO FAR.  ONE THING </p><p>THE MAJORITY IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HAD IN COMMON </p><p>WAS THAT IT WAS NON-AL-SABAH AND COULD CALL THE RULING </p><p>FAMILY TO ACCOUNT.  ALTHOUGH THE AMIR IS STILL CAREFUL </p><p>TO OBSERVE FORM AND CONSULT WITH THE MERCHANT </p><p>PATRIARCHS WHEN CONSIDERING MAJOR POLITICAL MOVES LIKE A </p><p>CABINET CHANGE, THERE IS NO LONGER ANY VEHICLE EXCEPT </p><p>THE INFORMAL DIWANIYA SYSTEM BY WHICH THE FAMILIES CAN </p><p>DEMAND AN ACCOUNTING FROM THE AL-SABAH.  HOWEVER, THEY </p><p>ARE IN A WEAKENED POSITION TO MAKE DEMANDS THROUGH THIS </p><p>INFORMAL SYSTEM, NOW THAT THE JENAAT AND SHIA </p><p>ARISTOCRACY ARE BEHOLDEN TO THE AL-SABAH TO A GREATER </p><p>DEGREE, AND THE SUNNI ARISTOCRATS ARE LESS ABLE TO BACK </p><p>THEIR POLITICAL INTERESTS WITH FINANCIAL MUSCLE. </p><p> </p><p>24.  THIS IS NOT TO SAY THERE HAS BEEN ANY OBVIOUS OR </p><p>DRAMATIC SHIFT IN OVERT POLITICAL POWER.  THE CABINET </p><p>REMAINS CAREFULLY BALANCED BETWEEN THE AL-SABAH AND </p><p>OTHER FAMILIES, ALTHOUGH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FINANCE, </p><p>THE NON-AL-SABAH PORTFOLIOS ARE NOT KEY ONES.  THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN A GROWING AWARENESS, HOWEVER, THAT THE AL-SABAH </p><p>MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE POLITICAL MOVES WITH LESS RESTRAINT </p><p>THAN IN THE PAST.  THE RECENT CONTROVERSIAL SHAKE-UP OF </p><p>UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION APPARENTLY INDUCED BY THE </p><p>RULING FAMILY (REF E) IS ONE INDICATOR OF THIS TREND. </p><p>A SIGN TO WATCH FOR IN THE FUTURE IS THE FATE OF FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER JASSIM AL-KHARAFI, A MEMBER OF THE SUNNI </p><p>ARISTOCRACY.  SHOULD HE BE REPLACED BY AN AL-SABAH, </p><p>THIS, ALONG WITH RETENTION OF AN AL-SABAH AS HEAD OF </p><p>THE CENTRAL BANK, WOULD GIVE THE RULING FAMILY MANAGERIAL </p><p>CONTROL OVER FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY AND FURTHER </p><p>AUGMENT THEIR HOLD ON GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. </p><p>- </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICY -- MORE </p><p>AUTHORITARIANISM ON THE WAY? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>25.  AN INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN THE RULING </p><p>FAMILY SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY IMMEDIATE IMPLICATIONS FOR </p><p>KUWAITI FOREIGN POLICY, WHICH HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE </p><p>PRESERVE OF THE AL-SABAH IN ANY CASE.  THE CONSERVATIVE </p><p>AL-SABAH ARE PRAGMATIC, CAREFUL RULERS FAVORABLY </p><p>DISPOSED TOWARD SOLID TIES WITH THE WEST, AS WAS AMPLY </p><p>DEMONSTRATED BY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MARITIME PRO- </p><p>TECTION REGIME.  THEY SHOW NO DISPOSITION TOWARD </p><p>EXTREMIST VIEWS WHICH COULD DEVELOP INTO ANTI-WESTERN </p><p>POLICIES.  THE DECLINING INFLUENCE OF OTHER FAMILY </p><p>GROUPS COULD EVENTUALLY ALLOW THE AL-SABAH TO ACT WITH </p><p>LESS RESTRAINT ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES, BUT WE DO NOT </p><p>ENVISION THIS HAVING ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON U.S. </p><p>INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>26.  DOMESTICALLY, REDUCED CHECKS ON AL-SABAH EXECUTIVE </p><p>POWER DECREASE THE PROSPECTS FOR ACCELERATED DEMOCRATI- </p><p>ZATION AND COULD LEAD TO A MORE AUTHORITARIAN SOCIETY. </p><p>IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE ANY OF THE OTHER FAMILY POWER </p><p>BLOCS, IN THEIR WEAKENED STATES, LEADING THE CHARGE FOR </p><p>RESTORATION OF A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WITH TEETH.  ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, THE STRONG KUWAITI TRADITION OF PLURALISTIC </p><p>DECISION-MAKING WILL PROBABLY PRECLUDE ANY RASH POWER </p><p>GRABS BY THE RULING FAMILY.  MORE LIKELY, THE AL-SABAH </p><p>WILL WORK TOWARD ACCRETION OF POWER SLOWLY AND </p><p>DELIBERATELY, WHILE BEING CAREFUL TO PRESERVE THE </p><p>APPEARANCE OF CONSULTATION WITH THE OTHER FAMILY BLOCS </p><p>AND CONTINUING TO PLAY THOSE BLOCS OFF AGAINST EACH </p><p>OTHER.  THE OTHER FAMILIES WILL NO DOUBT GRUMBLE ABOUT </p><p>THIS DEVELOPMENT.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THEIR WEAKENED </p><p>POSITIONS AND PROBABLE AL-SABAH CAUTION ABOUT GOING TOO </p><p>FAR TOO FAST, THE RULING FAMILY SHOULD BE ABLE TO EFFECT </p><p>A GREATER CENTRALIZATION OF AUTHORITY IN KUWAIT WITHOUT </p><p>BEING CHALLENGED BY ANY SERIOUS DOMESTIC DISSENT. </p><p>- </p><p>27.  THE MOST AVAILABLE CHECK ON AL-SABAH POWER MAY BE </p><p>THE DIVERSITY OF THE RULING FAMILY ITSELF.  EXCEPT IN </p><p>THE CASE OF SURVIVAL ISSUES, THE AL-SABAH ARE NOT </p><p>MONOLITHIC.  A LIVELY MANEUVERING FOR POWER AND </p><p>INFLUENCE BETWEEN THE JABER AND SALEM BRANCHES (REF D) </p><p>IS ALMOST ASSURED BY THE ORGANIZATION AND SUCCESSION </p><p>PATTERNS DEVELOPED OVER DECADES.  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE RECENT UNIVERSITY SHAKE-UP AROSE </p><p>NOT FROM A CONCERTED AL-SABAH DECISION BUT FROM THE </p><p>PLAYING OUT OF THESE INTER-RIVALRIES.  TO PLAY THE GAME, </p><p>AL-SABAH FACTIONS CAN AND DO SEEK OUT ALLIES AMONG THE </p><p>MERCHANTS, TRIBES OR OTHER ELEMENTS ON SPECIFIC ISSUES. </p><p>THUS, WHILE THE RELATIVE ACCRETION OF AL-SABAH POWER </p><p>ALTERS THE WEIGHTS OF SOME ELEMENTS IN THE KUWAITI </p><p>EQUATION, THE RESILIENCY AND DYNAMISM OF THE KUWAITI </p><p>SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT ONE OF THE MORE </p><p>INTERESTING AND DURABLE IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>HOWELL </p><p></p></div>
