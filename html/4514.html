British FM </p><p>Jack Straw, UN envoy Alvaro De Soto, Danish FM and EU term </p><p>President Per Stig Moller, Grossman and Wolfowitz are among </p><p>the list of visitors expected next week.  "Zaman" reports </p><p>that A/S Marc Grossman and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul </p><p>Wolfowitz are coming to Ankara at the beginning of December </p><p>to discuss Iraq, the EU, and Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Hurriyet" reports that TRNC President Denktas is </p><p>under heavy pressure by Ankara, Washington, the UN and the </p><p>TRNC opposition to accept the UN plan.  However, during his </p><p>interview with Bayrak TV, Denktas was said that `We asked </p><p>for extra time from the General-Secretary.  To accept the </p><p>plan is different from  evaluating and amending it.\' </p><p>"Radikal" reports that FM Yasar Yakis was successful in </p><p>convincing Denktas to sit at the table for discussions. </p><p>Tomorrow Denktas is expected to announce his decision to </p><p>discuss the UN plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU: All papers cover AKP Leader Tayyip Erdogan\'s successful </p><p>meeting with Portugal\'s PM Barroso.  "Radikal" reports that </p><p>the meeting in Lisbon boosted Erdogan\'s morale.  Barroso </p><p>reportedly gave Erdogan full support and said that the EU </p><p>should give a concrete answer, either `Yes\' or `No\', to </p><p>Turkey.  To have a country wait this long for an answer is </p><p>completely wrong, he said.  Barroso promised to support </p><p>Turkey in Copenhagen.  "Hurriyet" and "Radikal" report that </p><p>300 students from 45 universities have launched a new </p><p>campaign to send one million postcards to EU leaders asking </p><p>for their support for Turkey at the Copenhagen Summit. </p><p>Domestic Politics: The headscarf issue continues to be at </p><p>the top of the agenda.  "Sabah" reports that AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan was upset by the emphasis given to the headscarf </p><p>issue.  "Milliyet" reports that the Turkish General Staff is </p><p>preparing a report citing `fundamentalism\'  as Turkey\'s </p><p>number one security threat.  The report will be presented to </p><p>the NSC at their November 29 meeting.  Moreover, Land Forces </p><p>commander General Yalman will reportedly voice concerns </p><p>about the negative impact of politicians\' wives wearing </p><p>headscarves.  "Cumhuriyet" reports that the headscarf has </p><p>penetrated the Prime Ministry despite the warning of the </p><p>President that the headscarf must not be worn in public </p><p>places.  One of the Prime Ministry\'s secretaries went to </p><p>work yesterday wearing a headscarf. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Umut Oran: "Hurriyet" reports that Turkish Apparel Industry </p><p>Association (TGSD) Leader Umut Oran will take over the </p><p>leadership of the International Ready-wear Apparel </p><p>Federation (IAF) on December 2 in Miami.  130,000 </p><p>organizations from 27 different countries will be </p><p>represented at IAF.  IAF\'s 2003 congress will be held in </p><p>Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) NATO Summit </p><p>b)   UN Cyprus Plan </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"After the NATO Summit" </p><p>Haluk Ulman wrote in economic/political Dunya (11/26): "The </p><p>demise of communism left the NATO alliance without an enemy. </p><p>The lack of a common enemy led many to ask  whether European </p><p>members of NATO should seek more independent policies by </p><p>loosening their military ties with the US.  The continuation </p><p>of NATO is a very important issue for the US.  NATO remains </p><p>the most appropriate tool for the US to preserve its </p><p>influence and control over the European continent.  . The </p><p>search for a good justification for NATO\'s existence has </p><p>ended for the benefit of the US following the 9/11 events. </p><p>The new enemy is international terrorism, and the Prague </p><p>summit signified that new era.  What both the old and the </p><p>new members of NATO accepted, in fact, either reluctantly or </p><p>enthusiastically, was the American view on how to cope with </p><p>the common enemy, i.e. international terrorism." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What should be done about the Cyprus Plan?" </p><p>Sedat Ergin wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (11/26): "Two </p><p>conclusions can be made about the plan.  First of all, </p><p>although portions of the language may be inadequate, the </p><p>plan envisions sovereignty and equality for the Turkish </p><p>Cypriot side. . Secondly, the territorial concessions call </p><p>for very serious analysis and revision.  However, this can </p><p>be done at the negotiating table and, whether we like it or </p><p>not, we have to prepare ourselves mentally for territorial </p><p>concessions. . It would be very wrong to impose the EU </p><p>summit as a deadline for this plan. The document requires a </p><p>negotiation process, which will inevitably take place early </p><p>next year.  Therefore, it cannot be signed in its present </p><p>form." </p><p></p></div>
