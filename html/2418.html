<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000235 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL A/S BEERS AND AF A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X5, 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  EMBASSY COMMENTS ON NARCOTICS ANALYSIS </p><p>          AND DRUG CERTIFICATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.6X5, </p><p>1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) The following are Embassy,s comments on the CIA </p><p>Assessment dated December 28, 2001 and entitled &Nigeria: </p><p>Avoiding Counterdrug Reforms.8   We understand the </p><p>assessment was first distributed at a January 4, 2002 </p><p>INL-chaired interagency meeting on Nigeria,s certification. </p><p>The Embassy welcomes the opportunity to comment o nthe report </p><p>and its conclusions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>General Observation </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(S/NF) The Embassy believes the assessment,s conclusion </p><p>that the GON lacks commitment to counter-narcotics law </p><p>enforcement is unsubstantiated and paints a misleading </p><p>picture of GON efforts during the past year.  From our </p><p>perspective, a more appropriate conclusion would have been </p><p>that Nigeria continues to move in the right direction but </p><p>does, in facto, have a long way to go in overcoming serious </p><p>institutional and resource obstacles to a vigorous and </p><p>effective counter-narcotics strategy.  However, given the </p><p>myriad demands on the GON,s finite resources, the degree of </p><p>progress and the level of resource allocation indicates </p><p>political commitment to counternarcotics that, albeit </p><p>incomplete, should be encouraged, not dismissively treated as </p><p>negligible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) In portraying the Obasanjo Administration as either </p><p>reticent or opposed (due to corruption) to improved drug </p><p>control efforts, the assessment has selectively culled from </p><p>open sources and Embassy reporting instead of weighing the </p><p>entirety of reporting to get a more accurate picture.  The </p><p>notion that President Obasanjo has not supported </p><p>counter-narcotics reforms in the last year is simply not </p><p>true.  In many meetings with the President, we have raised </p><p>our anti-drug concerns and Obasanjo has always responded </p><p>positively and quickly.  Though the President seemed unaware </p><p>of the precise requirements of certification during an early </p><p>July meeting (Abuja 1547), he nonetheless responded </p><p>positively to the reforms that we encouraged, and </p><p>subsequnetly increased the budget of the NDLEA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) The following are comments linked to specific </p><p>points raised in the assessment: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--One Anti-Drug Agency.  The assessment portrays the NDLEA,s </p><p>role as the sole law enforcement agency with an express </p><p>counter-narcotics mandate as a weakness in Nigeria,s </p><p>performance.  This is not the case.  We have never considered </p><p>this a deficiency and we have not encouraged the GON to </p><p>enlist other agencies in the anti-drug effort.  Thus, the </p><p>assessment faults the GON for a perceived lapse of which they </p><p>have never been put on notice.  Moreover, the NDLEA has a </p><p>dedicated staff far superior to that of Nigerian Customs, </p><p>Police or any other law enforcement agency.  The NDLEA </p><p>receives greater resources and better training because of its </p><p>exclusive mandate.  We support this specialization in drug </p><p>control efforts ) it is resource-efficient, limits potential </p><p>corruption, and it has been effective.  Moreover, we should </p><p>not forget that we have the best access and relationship with </p><p>the NDLEA in the history of the Mission; only three years ago </p><p>we had difficulty meeting with the Chairman of the NDLEA, let </p><p>alone getting NDLEA to act. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Vice President:  While the Vice President,s alleged </p><p>corruption while in the Customs Service is common knowledge, </p><p>we  have no evidence that Atiku was ever involved in abetting </p><p>drug smuggling.  Nigeria,s ridiculously high tariffs make it </p><p>easy for Customs officers to get rich without involving </p><p>themselves in the drug trade.  Moreover, we have never seen </p><p>any overt or covert attempt by the VP to undermine the NDLEA. </p><p> To the contrary, he has been helpful in pushing forward </p><p>NDLEA Chairman Lafiaji,s FY2002 request for an additional </p><p>two billion naira in capital expenditures for the NDLEA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Counter-Drug Positions:  The assessment,s statement that </p><p>&In 2001 key positions in Nigeria,s counter-drug </p><p>bureaucracy went unfulfilled8 needs explanation.  Ibrahim </p><p>Lame, for two years the Senior Special Assistant to the </p><p>President on Drugs and Financial Crimes, was relieved of his </p><p>duties in mid-2001.  The position was subsequently abolished </p><p>because it was redundant and its utility was marginal.  The </p><p>Senior Special Assistant had no control over resources or </p><p>personnel.  He added little to policy formulation, and was </p><p>not a key player.  A Director will head the far stronger </p><p>Financial Crimes Commission, which will control significant </p><p>resources and will have both policy coordination and </p><p>operational roles. </p><p>--Similarly, the statement that &promises to increase the </p><p>counter-drug budget were not kept8 is also inaccurate.  The </p><p>Chairman of the Senate Committee of Drugs and Financial </p><p>Crimes, Lawal Shaibu, working closely with Chairman Lafiaji, </p><p>in early 2001 drafted a proposed supplementary budget request </p><p>of two billion naira (at the time about USD 20 million). </p><p>This was not/not the Federal Government,s request, but </p><p>rather a proposal emanating from the National Assembly. </p><p>Senator Shuaibu and other National Assembly supporters of the </p><p>NDLEA made this substantial request with the full expectation </p><p>that the Presidency could only grant a portion of it given </p><p>overall budgetary constraints.  (Note:  Shuaibu has again </p><p>made such a request for the FY2002 budget now being </p><p>considered )- 1.3 billion naira for the NDLEA. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Lafiaji: Strong Staying Power.  Chairman Bello Lafiaji has </p><p>already outlasted his past two predecessors and shows no sign </p><p>of leaving the job or waning in his enthusiasm, commitment </p><p>and performance.  He has a high integrity rating.  We have </p><p>seen no credible reports indicating any ties to suspected </p><p>drug traffickers, and as far as we know,  Lafiaji is beyond </p><p>reproach.  This stands in stark contrast to Lafiaji,s </p><p>predecessors.  President Obasanjo has told us that he is </p><p>pleased with Lafiaji,s performance and he has repeated </p><p>expressed his support for the Chairman,s leadership, most </p><p>recently on National television December 18, 2001, when he </p><p>bestowed one of Nigeria,s highest honors ) the Order of the </p><p>Niger ) on the Chairman for his work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--There has been no corroboration of the sensitive </p><p>intelligence report that Lafiaji is under threat of being </p><p>ousted by officials in the Presidency.  Even if some in the </p><p>Presidency oppose Lafiaji, he clearly still enjoys the </p><p>President,s support.  And that,s the point that should be </p><p>made.  In fact, Lafiaji,s role and authority are likely to </p><p>grow with the passing of Attorney General Bola Ige from the </p><p>scene. (Ige was a very strong supporter of Lafiaji,s NDLEA </p><p>leadership.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Extradition:  Nigeria has never extradited a U.S. fugitive </p><p>for drug trafficking ) the reference to U.S. extraditions </p><p>under the Abacha regime in 1994 is in error.  Nigeria has, </p><p>however, rendered into USG custody several important USG </p><p>fugitives, including drug traffickers sent to U.S. trials in </p><p>1994 under General Abacha,s rule and international terrorist </p><p>(Egypt Air highjacking) Rezaq under Babaginda,s rule.  Most </p><p>recently, in November 2000 President Obasanjo ordered the </p><p>rendition of four fugitives, including two drug traffickers </p><p>on the U.S. President,s list of 12 International Drug </p><p>Kingpins.  The GON carried out these renditions with </p><p>considerable political risk because they wanted to meet our </p><p>requirements but knew that they could not comply under </p><p>current judicial arrangements, with corrupt judges in place. </p><p>The GON offered additional renditions, but we said that we </p><p>could not accept its methods in doing so. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The Obasanjo administration has been and remains committed </p><p>to cooperation in turning over fugitives from U.S. justice. </p><p>The President and the late Attorney General often expressed </p><p>their conviction that Nigeria should not become a haven for </p><p>international criminals.  Yet they conceded, and we have </p><p>acknowledged, that Nigeria cannot develop and </p><p>institutionalize an efficient extradition process that </p><p>provides all the adequate due process safeguards in the near </p><p>term.  Sixteen consecutive years of military rule destroyed </p><p>the judiciary.  We should not pressure a two year-old </p><p>democratically elected government to effectuate extradition </p><p>without due observance of the rule of law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The paramount importance of the rule of law is something </p><p>that we have been telling the Nigerians.  Previously we </p><p>encouraged, even demanded, that Nigeria hand over -- using </p><p>whatever means necessary -- at least two fugitives in 2000. </p><p>Because we recognize the long-term importance of building an </p><p>appreciation for the rule of law, we no longer want to see </p><p>U.S. fugitives handed over in the way accepted before; we now </p><p>correctly encourage the Nigerians to develop a process that </p><p>observes procedural and substantive due process much like we </p><p>have in the United States.  Thus, because of the balancing of </p><p>these rule-of-law and law enforcement considerations, we must </p><p>give the current Administration a more reasonable amount of </p><p>time before concluding that they are non-cooperative </p><p>regarding extradition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Corruption:  The Obasanjo Administration has clearly </p><p>improved the fight against corruption in the past year.  The </p><p>Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses </p><p>Commission (ICPC) celebrated its first birthday in September </p><p>2001.  The Commission,s first group of dedicated staff ) </p><p>investigators, prosecutors, and administrators ) was hired </p><p>in December 2001 and starts work on February 1, 2002.  A </p><p>second batch of 200 will be hired in June 2002.   Just last </p><p>week, Obasanjo reportedly approved a 2002 budget request for </p><p>the ICPC of one billion naira (USD 9 million) in capital </p><p>expenditures and 400 million naira (USD 3.6 million) in </p><p>operating expenses.  Though this budget request must be </p><p>approved by the National Assembly, it represents a 250 </p><p>percent increase over the USD five million given to the ICPC </p><p>for all of its expenses in 2001.  Corruption </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(S/NF)Comment:  The end-of-the-year assessment of </p><p>Nigeria,s counter-drug performance does not give a complete </p><p>picture.  Some of the report,s inaccuracies could have been </p><p>avoided if the report had been shared in draft with the field </p><p>prior to publication.  Moreover, field visits by relevant </p><p>analysts should be encouraged in order to &ground truth8 </p><p>reporting otherwise evaluated from a distance in Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Certification in Perspective:  Improvement since 2000? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(S/NF) As Washington readers are aware, in the recently </p><p>passed Foreign Operations Bill, Congress established a new </p><p>standard for narcotics certification -- those countries that </p><p>have not &failed demonstrably8 in their counternarcotics </p><p>efforts.  Nigeria was granted full certification by the </p><p>President on March 1, 2001, passing a higher certification </p><p>standard.  As detailed above and in many Embassy reporting </p><p>cables including reftels, the Obasanjo Administration has </p><p>made limited but substantial reforms on the counter-drug and </p><p>law enforcement fronts.  While the significance of these </p><p>reforms ) some of them limited to pledges as of this writing </p><p>) can be debated, the argument that Nigeria has lost ground </p><p>in its anti-drug efforts since January 2001 is just not </p><p>credible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) The Ambassador also notes that if the Department of </p><p>Justice and DEA had strong concerns about the GON,s drug </p><p>control performance, these were not apparent during Chairman </p><p>Lafiaji,s November 8 meeting at DEA Headquaters, which the </p><p>Ambassador attended.  Instead, DEA officials praised the </p><p>NDLEA for improvements in its performance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>You Bet Things Look Better </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C/NF) Here,s our perspective on the last year of </p><p>counter-drug efforts.  During the past year: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Federal resources devoted to the anti-drug effort have </p><p>increased substantially; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--the NDLEA,s operational writ has expanded to all sea </p><p>ports; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--the amount of hard drugs seized rose 40 percent; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--arrests of drug traffickers rose 26 percent; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--drug-related convictions rose 51 percent; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--there were no acquittals in the 2,400 drug cases prosecuted; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--airport drug interdiction efforts are now so successful </p><p>that more seizures of heroin in U.S. ports of entry are made </p><p>from flights originating from Ghana rather than from Nigeria; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The late Attorney General led a GON team to a Rome meeting </p><p>with the FATF to address international concerns over </p><p>Nigeria,s money laundering controls; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--the GON has moved quickly to strengthen money-laundering </p><p>legislation and form a centralized authority to fight </p><p>financial crimes ) all in response to USG and FATF concerns; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--the Joint NDLEA-DEA Task Force has been re-energized and is </p><p>now investigating a major Nigeria based trafficker; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--the year-old Anti-Corruption Commission is gaining strength </p><p>and receiving more federal resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(S/NF) We set out certification benchmarks for the GON to </p><p>meet during 2001.  All of these were either met fully or met </p><p>with a good faith effort.  We should not make a certification </p><p>decision on the basis of whether we think many Nigerians are </p><p>&bad8 or whether the country has a large drug and organized </p><p>crime problem.  These are not the criteria; the benchmarks </p><p>are.  Nigeria has made the grade.  It should be certified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
