<p>UNCLAS HANOI 002225 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP, INR/EAP/SEA </p><p>SECDEF FOR ISA/EA/LSTERN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VM, BM, ASEAN </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM ON AN ASEAN TROIKA APPROACH TO BURMA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  SECSTATE 185162 </p><p> </p><p>1.   POLCOUNS AND POLOFF PRESENTED REFTEL POINTS 3 OCTOBER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02225  050421Z </p><p>TO MFA ASEAN DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR NGUYEN HUU CHI.  CHI </p><p>SAID THAT, AFTER MEETING WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL KOFI </p><p>ANNAN, VIETNAMESE FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN CONSULTED </p><p>CLOSELY AT THE UNGA WITH THE THAI AND BRUNEI FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS ON THE IDEA OF ACTIVATING THE ASEAN TROIKA ON </p><p>BURMA.  NIEN THEN HAD "CANDID AND FRIENDLY" TALKS WITH THE </p><p>BURMESE FOREIGN MINISTER.  BASED ON THESE DISCUSSIONS, THE </p><p>TROIKA WAS OF THE VIEW THAT THE SITUATION IN BURMA IS "NOT </p><p>ONE THAT AFFECTS OVERALL ASEAN STABILITY," AND GETTING THE </p><p>TROIKA INVOLVED IS NOT NOW NECESSARY.  (NOTE:  CHI INITIALLY </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THIS AS A GROUP DECISION, BUT LATER NOTED THAT </p><p>VIETNAM AS CHAIR MADE THE CALL ON BEHALF OF THE TROIKA.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>2.   CHI CONTINUED THAT THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT FOR THE </p><p>TROIKA LAID OUT AT THE JULY BANGKOK MINISTERIAL SPECIFIED </p><p>THAT THE TROIKA SHOULD BE CONVENED WITH THE CONSENSUS OF ALL </p><p>ASEAN MEMBERS, BUT AS YET NO SUCH CONSENSUS EXISTS ON BURMA. </p><p>ASEAN WOULD, OF COURSE, CONVENE THE TROIKA IF BURMA WERE TO </p><p>REQUEST IT; HOWEVER, BURMA HAS JUST RECENTLY SENT A LETTER </p><p>TO ALL THE ASEAN COUNTRIES ASKING FOR NO OUTSIDE, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY TROIKA, INTERVENTION IN ITS INTERNAL AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>3.   CHI TOLD POLOFFS HE HAS NO INFORMATION ON A VISIT TO </p><p>HANOI BY UN SPECIAL ENVOY ON BURMA RAZALI ISMAIL.  AS </p><p>VIETNAM HAS NO MANDATE TO ACTIVATE THE TROIKA UNILATERALLY, </p><p>IT HAS NO AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH RAZALI, AND THERE HAVE BEEN </p><p>NO CONTACTS OF WHICH CHI IS AWARE. </p><p> </p><p>4.   POLCOUNS SUGGESTED IT COULD BE USEFUL FOR VIETNAM AND </p><p>OTHER ASEAN COUNTRIES TO APPROACH BURMA AND TRY TO NUDGE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02225  050421Z </p><p>REGIME IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION, RATHER THAN WAITING FOR A </p><p>BURMESE REQUEST.  CHI SAID THIS WAS ALREADY DONE, AT THE </p><p>UNGA.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME OF THE ASEAN COUNTRIES, </p><p>SUCH AS THAILAND, FAVOR FURTHER ACTION, BUT THAILAND HAS </p><p>AGREED TO FOLLOW VIETNAM\'S LEAD.  ANY ASEAN APPROACH TO </p><p>BURMA WILL BE MADE THROUGH VIETNAM.  (NOTE: CHI\'S ATTITUDE </p><p>SUGGESTED VIETNAM BELIEVES IT DID ITS DUTY IN THAT REGARD AT </p><p>THE UNGA.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5.   COMMENT:  THE APPARENT DECISION NOT TO PRESS THE IDEA </p><p>OF TROIKA INVOLVEMENT IN BURMA WITH ANY VIGOR CLEARLY HAS </p><p>VIETNAM\'S IMPRINT ON IT.  THE RESULTS OF THIS FIRST TEST OF </p><p>HANOI\'S WILL AS ASC AND TROIKA CHAIR ARE NOT SURPRISING, </p><p>DEMONSTRATING VIETNAM\'S EVER-CAUTIOUS NATURE AND AVERSION TO </p><p>THE TYPE OF OUTSIDE INVOLVEMENT IT WOULD BE LOATHE TO ACCEPT </p><p>IN A SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCE.  EMBASSY WILL FOLLOW UP ON THE </p><p>ISSUE WITH OTHER ASEAN EMBASSIES TO GAIN THEIR PERSPECTIVES; </p><p>FOR NOW, HOWEVER, OUR HUNCH IS THAT NOT MUCH SHOULD BE </p><p>EXPECTED FROM THE TROIKA ON BURMA WHILE VIETNAM IS ITS </p><p>CHAIR.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
