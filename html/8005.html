Ambassador Pearson pointed to the fact of </p><p>UN sanctions as an impediment to the recovery of the Iraqi </p><p>people, and underlined the necessity that Turkey, having a </p><p>leadership position in the region and at the UN, should make </p><p>its voice heard to see an end to sanctions.  `Working </p><p>together with Turkey in the new Iraq will be a cooperation </p><p>that will build our relationship on solid ground.  It will </p><p>provide a huge benefit for Turkey\'s economy, creating new </p><p>market and business partnerships for Turkey,\' Pearson noted. </p><p>He also added that Americans, after removing Saddam through </p><p>military means, have now targeted building a democratic and </p><p>prosperous Iraq living in peace with its neighbors. </p><p>Ambassador Pearson said that was the main objective behind </p><p>the U.S., British and Spanish move at the UN, proposing </p><p>removal of economic sanctions on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Weekend papers speculate that the messages issued by </p><p>Wolfowitz and Grossman were designed to persuade Ankara to </p><p>comply with U.S. demands.  The U.S. is pressing Turkey to </p><p>pull back troops from Northern Iraq, but Ankara is reluctant </p><p>to do so unless the Iraqi national army takes over control </p><p>in the region, and can control terrorist groups, Sunday </p><p>papers say.  Turkey maintains a limited number of troops in </p><p>Northern Iraq in an effort to monitor PKK activities.  U.S. </p><p>has been vowing to the Turks that the issue of the PKK/KADEK </p><p>would be resolved.  All papers note that Ankara expects </p><p>clearer messages from Washington.  Weekend papers also </p><p>highlight the opening of the Turkish embassy in Baghdad, </p><p>despite warnings from U.S. that the Turkish envoy\'s safety </p><p>could not be guaranteed.  Turkey\'s Baghdad Ambassador, Osman </p><p>Paksut said Turkey would not be excluded from Iraq, and that </p><p>Ankara was planning to open consulates in Mosul and Kirkuk </p><p>as well, according to papers.  Meanwhile, President\'s office </p><p>on Friday has stated that `Turkish-American strategic </p><p>relations date back 50 years.  Disagreement among allies </p><p>over issues such as Iraq is natural.  Dailes reported on </p><p>Saturday that the sides must leave behind such discord, and </p><p>look at the future,\'.  Weekend papers also quote the head of </p><p>the Turkey-U.S. Caucus, Congressman Robert Wexler as finding </p><p>`insolent\' the assessment of Turkey by Deputy Secretary of </p><p>Defense Wolfowitz.  Wexler also advised Ankara to establish </p><p>stronger relationship with Israel, and to act in line with </p><p>U.S. sensitivities against Iran and Syria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New Aegean opening by Greece: Sunday\'s "Hurriyet" reports </p><p>that the Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou was pressing for </p><p>EU permission to lift visa requirement for Turkish tourists </p><p>doing day trips to the Greek islands in the Aegean. </p><p>`Papandreou wants to tear down the wall that divides the </p><p>Aegean,\' Hurriyet says on front page, reporting also about </p><p>Papandreou\'s project for transfer of Turkish water to arid </p><p>Greek islands, which might help establish lasting peace in </p><p>the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p>US-Turkey relations in the post Iraq war period </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkish-American relations in the long run" </p><p>Kamuran Ozbir wrote in nationalist (MHP Party) Ortadogu </p><p>(5/12): "Let\'s be clear and candid.  The Turkish government </p><p>has made a mistake during the Iraq war by fooling itself </p><p>with the `the US is incapable of taking action without </p><p>Turkey\' idea.  Thus the statements from Wolfowitz and </p><p>Grossman should be taken seriously and should not be </p><p>misinterpreted.  Both of them have a long-standing record </p><p>for being on Turkey\'s side.   There is a common message in </p><p>both statements of Wolfowitz and Grossman: `Turkey should </p><p>refrain from making evasive or unclear moves if it wants to </p><p>go back to good old days of Turkey-US relations.  Turkish </p><p>policy adjustments should take Washington\'s expectations </p><p>into utmost consideration.\'  I believe this is a clearcut </p><p>and well-phrased message and it tells us the truth.  If </p><p>Turkey starts being adventurous in foreign policy it will </p><p>definitely do a great harm to itself.  Turkey\'s interest is </p><p>to move forward along with its friend of 50-years, the US." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Where did we go wrong?" </p><p>Retired diplomat Gunduz Aktan noted in liberal-intellectual </p><p>Radikal (5/12): "The fact of the matter is that the </p><p>government has made a serious political mistake, and it </p><p>requires the AKP government to admit its mistakes vis--vis </p><p>the Turkish people first, not before Washington.  Any </p><p>government is doomed to correct its mistakes and policy </p><p>mishandling, unless they are admitted.  In normal western </p><p>standards, a policy failure is subject to investigation by </p><p>an independent commission.  We unfortunately do not have </p><p>such a tradition in our political system. . On the other </p><p>hand, those in the US who are close enough to Turkey and who </p><p>are shaped Washington\'s policy by taking Turkey for granted </p><p>have gone wrong, too.  They are now either disappointed or </p><p>bitterly angry against Turkey.  Turkey and the US should </p><p>start cooperation and utmost coordination to tune each </p><p>other\'s policy especially on Syria and Iran.  Our relations </p><p>cannot possibly tolerate another mistake or failure." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
