<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000268 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Stop acting headboy" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      dedicated its February 6 editorial to urging the </p><p>      United States and Britain to "desist from </p><p>      attacking" Iraq, adding that only the United </p><p>      Nations Security Council has the mandate "to </p><p>      hunt down all nations" amassing weapons of mass </p><p>      destruction.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The Americans and their British cousins are </p><p>      already beating the war drums as they psyche up (sic) </p><p>      for a war with Iraq.  They are alleging that President </p><p>      Saddam Hussein might be harboring weapons of mass </p><p>      destruction, a clear excuse to topple the Iraqi leader </p><p>      because he has refused to toe their line.  Africa </p><p>      yesterday said no to war on Iraq. . .  We applaud the </p><p>      AU position on Iraq and demand that the United States </p><p>      and Britain listen to the voice of reason and desist </p><p>      from attacking that country.  It is only the United </p><p>      Nations Security Council which has the mandate to take </p><p>      drastic action on a nation if it is deemed necessary. . </p><p>      .  While we do not support the building of weapons of </p><p>      mass destruction, we believe it is not the business of </p><p>      the U.S. and Britain to hunt down all nations that have </p><p>      these weapons, but that of the U.N.  The naked truth </p><p>      and purpose of the American and British plan to attack </p><p>      Iraq appears to be clearly that of trying to promote </p><p>      their business interests.  They want a change of </p><p>      government in that country in the same way they are </p><p>      trying to topple President Mugabe\'s government because </p><p>      of land reforms.  We wish to remind them that the power </p><p>      to remove or retain a head of state in a country rests </p><p>      with the people of that country.  The Americans and the </p><p>      British should leave the people of Iraq alone." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
