O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe\'s Stock Market: Illusory Gains </p><p> </p><p>1. Comment:  Even though headlines boast of huge </p><p>windfalls for equity investors, share prices on the </p><p>Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) have sunk in real terms </p><p>since 1998.  Apparently, the country\'s high inflation and </p><p>macroeconomic distortions have duped wishful traders. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p>ZSE in Nominal Terms </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>2. In local currency (and nominal) terms, the ZSE\'s </p><p>industrial index appears to have risen sharply over the </p><p>past five years: </p><p> </p><p>1/98 -      7,896 </p><p>1/99 -      7,068 </p><p>1/00 -     16,774 </p><p>1/01 -     26,354 </p><p>1/02 -     46,149 </p><p>1/03 -    134,416 </p><p> </p><p>. . . and more recently: </p><p> </p><p>4/03 -    187,000 </p><p> </p><p>ZSE in Real Terms </p><p>----------------- </p><p>3. Conversely, the index has shed 20 percent since 1998 </p><p>in inflation-adjusted Zimdollars.  Yet Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>Consumer Price Index is a conservative inflation measure. </p><p>It reflects products unavailable at controlled prices as </p><p>well as subsidized fuel, food and energy.  Therefore, we </p><p>consider dollarization a more dependable deflator. By </p><p>converting the index into U.S. dollars at the above </p><p>intervals, we see that its value has fluctuated wildly, </p><p>but fallen: </p><p> </p><p>1/98 -    471 </p><p>1/99 -    191 </p><p>1/00 -    409 </p><p>1/01 -    374 </p><p>1/02 -    134 </p><p>1/03 -     84 </p><p> </p><p>4/03 -    138 </p><p> </p><p>Both rising revenue projections for exporters (the </p><p>official rate has devalued from 55 to 824:1) and a </p><p>Zimdollar recovery (from 1605 to 1360:1 since Jan. 1) </p><p>seem to have triggered recent bullish sentiment, pushing </p><p>the index up this month. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. As we have often argued, high inflation and </p><p>macroeconomic distortions play tricks on Zimbabweans, </p><p>making them feel less impoverished than objective </p><p>analysis would suggest.  Equity investors are no </p><p>exception. (Many Zimbabweans also believe their </p><p>automobiles are gaining value, a similar illusion.) </p><p> </p><p>5. Undoubtedly, fortunes have been made in the ZSE.  With </p><p>daily fluctuations reaching 20 percent, it\'s a day- </p><p>trader\'s paradise.  But it has not been a reliable haven </p><p>for buy-and-hold investors.  Many would have done better </p><p>hoarding U.S. dollars.  Of course, it is unsurprising </p><p>that listed companies have lost value while the economy </p><p>has retracted 30-40 percent.  In a "normal" economy, </p><p>Zimbabwean blue chips might tempt value-oriented </p><p>investors (with price/earnings ratios often around 4-8). </p><p>But in an economy plummeting by over a percent each </p><p>month, the ZSE remains a speculator\'s play. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
