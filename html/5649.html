<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/20/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: A VISIT TO FOUR SOUTHERN STATES: PART 2 - </p><p>BAYELSA </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 102 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINS0JN-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) A </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary.  Once almost guaranteed re-election to the </p><p>governorship of oil producing Bayelsa State, the incumbent, </p><p>DSP Alamieyesiegha, is facing serious charges of corruption </p><p>that have the possibility of disqualifying him.  In the four </p><p>years of his administration, the governor has had some very </p><p>visible successes in improving the infrastructure and economy </p><p>of Bayelsa.  Despite his accomplishments, the fact of </p><p>continuing legal challenges to his candidacy reflects </p><p>dissatisfaction with the corruption that permeates Nigerian </p><p>politics.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  For at least the past fifty years, repeated attempts </p><p>have been made to divide Nigeria up into a manageable and </p><p>rational pattern of States that would satisfy the demands for </p><p>autonomy of its hundreds of distinct ethnic groups.  Parts of </p><p>both Delta and Rivers States were combined in 1996 to form </p><p>Bayelsa State and meet the desires of the Ijaw ethnic group. </p><p>Bayelsa thus became the thirty-sixth and newest Nigerian </p><p>State.  The Governor of Bayelsa is Chief Diepreye Solomon </p><p>Peter Alamieyesiegha (known to his supporters as "DSP" or the </p><p>"Governor-General of the Ijaws".)  He is a member of the </p><p>ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and until the PDP </p><p>gubernatorial primary in early January, DSP appeared to be a </p><p>shoo-in for re-election.  Minister of Public Works and close </p><p>confidant of President Olusegun Obasanjo, Tony Anenih, had </p><p>endorsed the re-election of all incumbent PDP governors and </p><p>vowed the Party\'s support. DSP was rumored to have a campaign </p><p>warchest of billions of naira; so much financing that he </p><p>reportedly purchased thirty-five speed boats to campaign in </p><p>the region where it is usually easier to travel by boat than </p><p>by road.  In late January, however, a stumbling block arose </p><p>in the form of a citizen\'s complaint against DSP to the </p><p>Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses </p><p>Commission (ICPC).  The complaint charged him with fraud and </p><p>improper use of government funds.  Eight other PDP governors </p><p>(four of whom, including DSP, are from the south) are also </p><p>under investigation by the ICPC.  With elections scheduled </p><p>for March and April, the road to the Government House at </p><p>Creek Haven does not look as easy for DSP as it once did. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Getting to Bayelsa </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Shortly before the ICPC investigations started, </p><p>PolOffs went to pay a courtesy/orientation visit to Governor </p><p>Alamieyeseigha . After flying from Lagos to Port Harcourt in </p><p>Rivers State, the short trip by road to Yenagoa, the capital </p><p>of Bayelsa, underscored the endemic problem of no maintenance </p><p>of federal roads in most of Nigeria.  Bayelsa is a littoral </p><p>oil state and, with its share of oil income, should be fairly </p><p>prosperous and well-maintained, but gaping holes in the road </p><p>made for slow going in our short drive to the capital.  The </p><p>situation changed remarkably, however, at the Rivers/Bayelsa </p><p>border.  A four-lane, newly-paved highway led north into the </p><p>State through what appeared to be overgrown, uncultivated </p><p>land.  About two miles from the Bayelsa State Offices, a </p><p>"commercial strip" started that ran all the way to our </p><p>destination at the State Offices.  The strip was only one </p><p>small store or stall deep, and we then understood how Bayelsa </p><p>State earned the sobriquet of the "State with only one city </p><p>and one road." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Big man in Bayelsa </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  We were ushered in to the spacious and elegantly </p><p>appointed offices of DSP, to join a group of people waiting </p><p>to see the governor.  After a wait of slightly over an hour </p><p>during which DSP apparently dealt with state vendors and </p><p>contractors ahead of us in line, we got to talk with the </p><p>governor.  (Comment.  DSP actually is a big man--over six </p><p>feet tall and very heavyset.  He and the PDP members of his </p><p>cabinet and administration are always photographed in black, </p><p>wide-brimmed fedoras, giving them the appearance of early </p><p>twentieth century Mafioso.  End comment.)  DSP was expansive </p><p>and happy to spend time telling PolOffs of the </p><p>accomplishments of his administration.  He said that when he </p><p>came into office, there was no State Office building or </p><p>governor\'s Mansion, and he slept on the floor of the </p><p>dilapidated former office building.  Power generation in the </p><p>State had been so bad or lacking, he said, that until </p><p>recently the State could provide power only every third day. </p><p>He bragged about the new road and a recent improvement in the </p><p>provision of electric power to the capital.  He told us that </p><p>his dream of building the School of Arts and Sciences at </p><p>Niger Delta University had come true when the school opened </p><p>early this year. </p><p>5. (C)  Asked about his campaign for governor, he was proud </p><p>to tell us about the thirty-five boats he had bought and </p><p>invited us to take a boat tour with him of the State on our </p><p>next trip.  DSP was not so ebullient when asked about </p><p>challengers he faced and possible political violence that </p><p>might flare up during the campaigns.  At the time, DSP faced </p><p>at least ten opponents, even some from his own party and </p><p>administration.  He frowned and answered that none of those </p><p>contenders would last to the primary (he was correct), and if </p><p>any one caused politically related violence he would "get </p><p>them, even if (he) had to track them to their bedrooms!"  The </p><p>meeting ended on a positive note with the governor reminding </p><p>us that Bayelsa was only six years old and had already made </p><p>great progress under his administration. </p><p>6. (C)  Comment.  DSP is a former military officer, as are </p><p>many at all levels of the Obasanjo government.  Military </p><p>style of unitary control, with everyone having to come to him </p><p>for decisions, was evident during our meeting.  He has no </p><p>real opposition, and if the ICPC investigation does not </p><p>disqualify him, he will probably be re-elected.  However, the </p><p>ICPC complaint was brought by noted human rights activist, </p><p>attorney and presidential candidate, Gani Fawahinmi.  The </p><p>presence of Fawahinmi, a dogged pursuer of alleged </p><p>miscreants, makes the matter unlikely to just disappear. </p><p>Despite public statements of support from the PDP and the </p><p>Obasanjo administration, DSP has had to take focus off his </p><p>campaign and respond to the multiplying charges.  The facts </p><p>that DSP has faced one challenge after another to his </p><p>candidacy, and that one of the nine (Chinwoke Mbadinuju from </p><p>Anambra State) has already been disqualified, reflect the </p><p>public\'s growing demand for transparency and accountability </p><p>in government. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
