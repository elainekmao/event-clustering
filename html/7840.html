Concern about the supply of cooking gas and related </p><p>fuels for the southern region of Iraq continues.  The Basrah </p><p>refinery, the reported primary source of LPG cooking gas for </p><p>most of the south, is damaged and not expected to be on line </p><p>for at least a month.  An effort to provide bottled gas from </p><p>Kuwait to Umm Qasr, while successful, given the logistical </p><p>challenges, demonstrated the unfeasibility of launching a </p><p>wider effort for the rest of the southern region. </p><p>Meanwhile, reports from several governorates in the south </p><p>describe dwindling domestic supplies from a couple weeks to </p><p>three or four days to none. </p><p> </p><p>2.  There are increasing reports of the removal of urban </p><p>tree stocks in several locations as well as reports of </p><p>increased incidence of burns attributed to people attempting </p><p>to cook with firewood and other fuels with which they are </p><p>unfamiliar.  Planning efforts to acquire LPG from outside </p><p>the area are hindered by a concurrent lack of appropriate </p><p>trucking to move the gas.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>BACKGROUND TO COOKING GAS IN IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  In Iraqi homes, the primary fuel for cooking in most </p><p>Iraqi homes is Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), which consists of </p><p>75 percent propane and 25 percent butane (Note: this </p><p>combination is reportedly used because it is more stable </p><p>than pure propane in the extreme heat of Iraq.  End note.) </p><p>Before the war, families regularly traded-in empty bottles </p><p>for filled bottles at their local gas stations, which are </p><p>located throughout most communities.  The average bottle </p><p>contained 12 kilograms (KGs) of LPG lasting approximately 2 </p><p>months.  These stations were supplied by trucks that </p><p>regularly brought newly filled bottles, taking the empties </p><p>back to bottling plants for refilling/recharging.  An </p><p>undetermined number of recharging plants are located around </p><p>the region; one of the larger plants is reported to be in Al </p><p>Kut in Wasit Governorate.  LPG for the south was supplied to </p><p>these recharging plants by truck from the refinery in </p><p>Basrah.  Further north, the LPG was reportedly supplied from </p><p>Baghdad, reaching Baghdad by pipeline from the Al Baigi </p><p>refinery in the north. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>LACK OF COOKING GAS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  In its earliest meetings with the newly-formed town </p><p>council in Umm Qasr in mid April, the DART first heard of </p><p>the need for cooking gas.  Around the same time, the first </p><p>reports came in from International Medical Corps (IMC), from </p><p>its assessments of health care centers in the southern </p><p>region, of growing incidence of burns caused by people </p><p>attempting to cook over open fires -- a practice with which </p><p>most urban Iraqis are unfamiliar.  The Umm Qasr city council </p><p>members complained that people were beginning to trim and </p><p>cut down the few trees in the city, and the evidence of this </p><p>practice is being noted with growing frequency.  At the </p><p>Infrastructure meeting in the Humanitarian Operations Center </p><p>(HOC) on 28 April, a returning assessment team reported that </p><p>people were cutting down the trees in the medians on Umm </p><p>Qasr\'s parkways. </p><p> </p><p>5.  In An Nasiriyah, the Irish NGO, GOAL, described the </p><p>dwindling cooking fuel situation as "dire".  On 1 May, GOAL </p><p>reported that propane supplies in An Nasiriyah were </p><p>virtually "non-existent" and that kerosene supplies are </p><p>"perilously low."  GOAL also reported on 23 April that a </p><p>number of people looted a propane factory in An Nasiriyah by </p><p>breaking the pipes and manually opening the valves to fill </p><p>bottles.  As a result of this looting, a lethal mixture of </p><p>sulphur and vapor remains in the tank, which could easily </p><p>explode.  Another incident of looting occurred on 29 April, </p><p>when looters again manually broke open a main pipeline </p><p>valve.  This time, the pressurized pipeline exploded, </p><p>killing two people and seriously burning two more. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Coalition forces in Al Kut reported a near-riot during </p><p>an attempt to distribute the remaining bottles at a facility </p><p>there.  Save the Children reported that during their small- </p><p>scale gas bottle distribution in Umm Qasr (see below) people </p><p>drove in from as far as Basrah asking to buy gas.  The DART, </p><p>in its most recent assessment report from Anbar Governorate, </p><p>noted similar problems. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>DONATED BOTTLED GAS FROM KUWAIT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  In response to the request from the Umm Qasr city </p><p>council, actions by the DART led to a joint effort by </p><p>Salvation Army, who procured and transported bottles of gas </p><p>donated by the Government of Kuwait to Umm Qasr, and Save </p><p>the Children, who provided organization assistance for the </p><p>bottles\' distribution through Public Distribution System </p><p>agents in the town.  In addressing the needs of the 30,000- </p><p>plus people of Umm Qasr, this distribution was highly </p><p>successful.  Relying on community participation, this </p><p>distribution is one of the first distributions in the south </p><p>not marred by out-of-control crowds and looting of supplies. </p><p>However, the associated high costs (over USD 1,200 for each </p><p>of the seven trucks needed to transport the 4,300 bottles </p><p>from Kuwait) and excessive person-days required to implement </p><p>this effort (nearly two weeks of full-time organizational </p><p>work), also demonstrated its limited feasibility for broader </p><p>application in the region. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>ASSUMED BROAD-SCALE NEEDS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>8.  A request was sent out earlier this week to Coalition </p><p>forces, NGOs, and town councils asking for current estimates </p><p>of fuel and related fuel transport needs.  So far, no </p><p>responses to this request have come back.  At this time, the </p><p>region\'s only town council known to have a unit specifically </p><p>dedicated to fuel is in An Nasiriyah.  GOAL has assigned one </p><p>civil engineer fulltime to this unit.  Other DART partners </p><p>have been encouraged to support the establishment of similar </p><p>units in the towns where they work. </p><p> </p><p>9.  A recent report by the GOAL engineer estimates the daily </p><p>need in the area of An Nasiriyah at approximately 11,000 </p><p>bottles per day for a population estimated at approximately </p><p>800,000.  By extension, the daily need for the four southern </p><p>governorates of Basrah, Thi Qar, Missan, and Muthana, is </p><p>estimated to be in the area of 68,000 bottles per day for a </p><p>population of five million people.  Include the next six </p><p>adjoining governorates to the northwest, and this number </p><p>doubles.  GOAL, in its report, states that with some minor </p><p>repairs they could get some of the damaged bottling plants </p><p>back into basic operation and if coupled with production </p><p>from existing plants and if bottles were only three-quarters </p><p>filled, An Nasiriyah facilities could possibly meet </p><p>immediate local demand.  The problem, however, is lack of </p><p>gas to fill the bottles.  During the 28 April Infrastructure </p><p>Meeting at the HOC, it was reported that the Basrah </p><p>Refinery\'s facilities for LPG are damaged and may not be </p><p>operational for another month. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>ACQUIRING OUTSIDE SOURCES OF LPG </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Unconfirmed reports state that Al Baigi\'s LPG </p><p>facilities are operable and serving the north.  Previously, </p><p>LPG was piped to Baghdad where it was put in tankers and </p><p>trucked as far south as Al Kut where there is a major bottle </p><p>manufacture and charging plant.  The boundary between the Al </p><p>Baigi system and the LPG supply system from Basrah is </p><p>unclear, but it is a reasonable assumption that distribution </p><p>from this northern system could alleviate a portion of the </p><p>problem.  The Kuwaiti National Oil Company has indicated its </p><p>ability and willingness to provide LPG to the south.  A </p><p>private contracting company also has offered to procure LPG </p><p>and bring it by barge into Umm Qasr.  However, in all </p><p>instances there are problems related to trucking.  The </p><p>Kuwaitis have stated that they will not allow their LPG </p><p>tankers to travel into Iraq because of their limited supply </p><p>of trucks and the instability in Iraq.  The Kuwaiti National </p><p>Oil Company indicated, however, that they would allow Iraqi </p><p>trucks into Kuwait for filling, if they passed routine </p><p>Kuwaiti safety inspections.  In response to this offer, </p><p>efforts were made to locate Iraqi LPG tankers. In the course </p><p>of this effort, a larger problem is the general absence of </p><p>any significant numbers of Iraqi fuel transport trucks of </p><p>any kind. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>DIFFICULTIES IDENTIFYING TRUCKING STOCK </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Determining the whereabouts and status of Iraq\'s fuel </p><p>trucking stock has been frustrating and confusing. </p><p>Coalition trucks are reportedly distributing diesel to gas </p><p>stations around the country, but the scope of this effort is </p><p>not currently understood.  Early responses to a Request for </p><p>Information (RFI) to Coalition forces around the country </p><p>indicates that Coalition units also are looking for trucks. </p><p>No reports of identified stocks </p><p>have been received in response to the RFI. </p><p> </p><p>12.  GOAL located only three trucks in the whole of An </p><p>Nasiriyah, only two of which are operable (Note: GOAL </p><p>further calculated a need for at least 20, 36,000 liter </p><p>trucks to meet local demand.  End Note.)  A Mercy Corps </p><p>International assessment team reported from Al Kut, where </p><p>there was thought to be a large stock of gas trucks, that </p><p>all the trucks had been taken back to the central trucking </p><p>yards in Dowrah, near Baghdad, and to Al Hillah.  However, </p><p>Coalition forces report that there are trucks in Al Kut and </p><p>they planned to take a representative from Salvation Army </p><p>there on 28 April, to try and find and assess the trucks. </p><p>There is no information on the outcome of that effort, but </p><p>GOAL asked for clarification on a rumor they heard of eight </p><p>tankers are in route from Al Kut to Kuwait.  Concurrently, </p><p>an unconfirmed, verbal report from the HOC says the truck </p><p>yards in Dowrah are empty or looted. </p><p> </p><p>13.  According to the United Nations Joint Logistics Center </p><p>(UNJLC), much of the national trucking stock has been </p><p>"privatized" by the drivers, repainted, and put into private </p><p>use.  To further confuse things, Save the Children reports </p><p>that during their distribution, a driver with a full truck </p><p>of bottled gas showed up in Umm Qasr trying to sell the gas. </p><p>Who the driver worked, for or where the gas came from, is </p><p>not known. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  A brief informal meeting was held on 28 April between </p><p>representatives from the UNJLC Fuel Planning Cell, the U.S. </p><p>Corps of Engineers, and the DART.  When all the accumulated </p><p>bits of information were reviewed in their entirety, there </p><p>was consensus that the problem may be far more serious than </p><p>some had earlier considered.  All agreed that the problem, </p><p>if not quickly addressed, could have significant negative </p><p>impact on the environment, public health, and society-at- </p><p>large (e.g., exacerbating social unrest).  To address the </p><p>problem, increased efforts are required on a number of </p><p>fronts including: </p><p> </p><p>--  Raised prioritization for bringing LPG production </p><p>facilities in Basrah into operation; </p><p> </p><p>--  A more robust effort on the part of Coalition forces to </p><p>locate and inventory remaining Iraqi national trucking </p><p>stock, with particular attention to finding remaining LPG </p><p>tankers; </p><p> </p><p>--  An accelerated effort at the town council level to </p><p>determine immediate emergency fuel trucking needs and </p><p>related storage capacities, and to plan for internal </p><p>distribution; and </p><p> </p><p>--  An effort to determine the viability of contracting </p><p>outside trucking (e.g., Saudi Arabia) coupled with </p><p>importation of LPG. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
