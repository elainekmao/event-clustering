<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002402 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PM AFFIRMS GOJ INTENT TO HOLD ELECTIONS JUNE 17, </p><p>YET MANY WONDER IF IT\'S A WISE IDEA </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 1336 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5(B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) PM Ali Abul Ragheb affirmed publicly on April 18 that </p><p>the GOJ intends to proceed with parliamentary elections on </p><p>June 17.  However, the King told the British Ambassador that </p><p>there were 70-30 odds that elections would go forward as </p><p>planned and   the King confided to the Ambassador on April </p><p>18th that there is a possibility of delaying the elections </p><p>for two months, weighing June 17 against a possible September </p><p>9 date.  Numerous contacts and potential candidates affirmed </p><p>they were waiting to hear whether the GOJ intended to proceed </p><p>with the elections, and many wonder if the June 17 date was </p><p>the wisest choice in an uncertain political climate.  On the </p><p>other hand, a fourth postponement of the election date would </p><p>not help the King\'s credibility, already shaken by public </p><p>suspicions that he did much more to help the coalition in </p><p>Iraq than he is willing to admit in public.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ONE STEP FORWARD...ONE STEP BACK? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The PM announced on April 18 that the GOJ will hold </p><p>parliamentary elections on June 17 and urged potential </p><p>candidates "to start presenting themselves to the public". </p><p>He also urged citizens to participate in the election process </p><p>and to vote for those who will best serve Jordan\'s and </p><p>citizens\' interests.  British Ambassador Prentice told the </p><p>Ambassador that King Abdullah had told him last week that the </p><p>odds of holding elections in June were 70-30.  On April 18th, </p><p>however, the King told Ambassador Gnehm that he was weighing </p><p>the option of a two month delay and considering September 9th </p><p>as an alternate date.  Such a date, he said, would be more in </p><p>keeping with the traditional October start date for new </p><p>Parliaments. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>MANY SEEK POSTPONEMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In a series of meetings over the past months with </p><p>former Ministers, ex parliamentarians, potential candidates </p><p>for parliament, businessmen and political analysts, contacts </p><p>shared their views on how Jordan has fared since Parliament </p><p>was dissolved two years ago, wondered about the timing of the </p><p>elections in June, and whether the elections should proceed </p><p>as planned in the context of the war in Iraq and its </p><p>aftermath.  Most of our contacts said the government erred by </p><p>deciding to hold elections on June 17, given the war in Iraq, </p><p>a known quantity at the time the election date was announced. </p><p> Nearly all argued that the GOJ should postpone elections for </p><p>a fourth time citing the war in Iraq and the uncertain </p><p>political environment post war. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>SOME FEAR IF ELECTIONS HELD, EXTREMISTS WILL BENEFIT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Some contacts suggest it would be wise if the </p><p>government postponed the June elections until the fall to </p><p>allow breathing room between the end of the war in Iraq and </p><p>new elections.  If elections take place in June, as </p><p>scheduled, some feel the Islamic Action Front (IAF)--which </p><p>boycotted the last parliamentary elections but are expected </p><p>to participate in June--would make substantial gains in </p><p>parliamentary seats.  While some see this as a potential </p><p>result of Jordanians\' anti-war ire, they are confident the </p><p>government is capable of handling the Islamists and see this </p><p>development as a positive step since the most vocal and well </p><p>organized opposition in Jordan would be working within </p><p>Jordan\'s political establishment.  However, several potential </p><p>candidates have told us they will have to match the IAF\'s </p><p>anti-American and anti-Israel rhetoric to be able to compete </p><p>in elections held in June.  Other ex MP\'s have told us they </p><p>have been unable to get campaign workers to focus on </p><p>elections, both because of the war and because many believe </p><p>the GOJ will postpone elections again. </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The King\'s private comments on an election date </p><p>notwithstanding, the PM\'s public announcement of elections on </p><p>June 17 will be tricky to pull back.  We believe that there </p><p>is another important factor at work in this which the GOJ </p><p>should consider--concern for the King\'s credibility.  Many </p><p>Jordanians are convinced that the King did far more to help </p><p>the coalition than he is willing to admit in public.  Another </p><p>seeming broken promise would do nothing to repair the King\'s </p><p>standing. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
