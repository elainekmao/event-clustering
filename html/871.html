<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 002488 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB, S/CT, NEA, EUR/CEN; LONDON FOR POL/TUELLER; PARIS </p><p>FOR POL/RAVELING; ROME FOR POL/DEMPSEY; MBABANE FOR MALINOWSKI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  3/27/07 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PGOV, KISL, PREL, AF, PK, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  AFGHANISTAN:  TALIBAN OFFICIAL CONFIRMS THAT MULLAH OMAR </p><p>ASKED BIN LADEN TO REFRAIN FROM "ANTI-SAUDI" ACTIVITIES </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) FBIS LD2603173097 (B) ISLAMABAD 1750 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY TOM PRICE, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASONS: 1.5 (C) (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  MARCH 27 PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS STATE THAT </p><p>MULLAH OMAR MET WITH FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN IN KANDAHAR </p><p>ON MARCH 25 AND TOLD HIM NOT TO USE "AFGHAN TERRITORY FOR ANTI- </p><p>SAUDI GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES."  TAYYAB HUSSAINI, A GOOD CONTACT AT </p><p>THE AFGHAN EMBASSY HERE, CONFIRMED THESE REPORTS AND NOTED THAT </p><p>OMAR\'S COMMENTS DID NOT REPRESENT A SHIFT IN TALIBAN POLICY TOWARD </p><p>BIN LADEN, BUT WERE A "WARNING."  SAUDI EMBASSY POLOFF HAMZA GASSAS </p><p>TOLD POLOFF THAT OMAR\'S COMMENTS COULD MEAN THAT THE TALIBAN ARE </p><p>BECOMING MORE CONCERNED ABOUT BIN LADEN\'S ACTIVITIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>OMAR MEETS BIN LADEN </p><p>--------------------/ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) PAKISTANI NEWSPAPERS REPORTED ON MARCH 27 THAT MULLAH OMAR, </p><p>THE TALIBAN LEADER, MET WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN, EX-SAUDI FINANCIER </p><p>AND SUPPORTER OF RADICAL ISLAMIC CAUSES, IN KANDAHAR ON MARCH 25 TO </p><p>INFORM HIM OF "THE CONCERN OF THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT ABOUT HIS </p><p>ACTIVITIES" IN AFGHANISTAN.  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLES, OMAR THEN </p><p>TOLD BIN LADEN THAT HE SHOULD NOT USE "AFGHAN TERRITORY FOR ANTI- </p><p>SAUDI GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES."   HE ALSO REPORTEDLY TOLD BIN LADEN </p><p>THAT IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT U.S. FORCES SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER NEEDED THERE.  ONE OF THE </p><p>ARTICLES GOES ON TO NOTE THAT THE TALIBAN DELEGATION TO THE MARCH </p><p>23 OIC SUMMIT IN ISLAMABAD HAD MET WITH THE SAUDI DELEGATION AND </p><p>BEEN INFORMED OF SAUDI CONCERNS ABOUT BIN LADEN. </p><p> </p><p>EMBOFF SAYS TALIBAN HAVE NOT CHANGED POLICY ON BIN LADEN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -----------/ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ON MARCH 27, POLOFF MET WITH TAYYAB HUSSAINI, SECOND </p><p>SECRETARY AT THE TALIBAN-CONTROLLED AFGHAN EMBASSY HERE, AND ASKED </p><p>HIM TO COMMENT ON THE ARTICLES.  HUSSAINI, WHO SAID HE HAD SPOKEN </p><p>TO TALIBAN OFFICIALS IN KANDAHAR EARLIER IN THE DAY, CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>THE ARTICLES ARE ACCURATE:  "MULLAH OMAR SUMMONED BIN LADEN FROM </p><p>JALALABAD AND REQUESTED A MEETING WITH HIM IN KANDAHAR BECAUSE HE </p><p>IS CONCERNED THAT BIN LADEN IS BECOMING TOO AGGRESSIVE IN HIS </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS."  HUSSAINI DID NOT DIVULGE WHAT BIN LADEN HAD </p><p>SAID THAT HAD AROUSED TALIBAN CONCERN.  (NOTE:  BIN LADEN HAS GIVEN </p><p>A NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS IN RECENT WEEKS IN WHICH HE ATTACKED SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA AND THE U.S.)  POLOFF ASKED HUSSAINI WHETHER THE TALIBAN </p><p>DELEGATION HAD MET WITH SAUDI REPRESENTATIVES AT THE RECENT OIC </p><p>SUMMIT.  HUSSAINI REPLIED THAT MULLAH RABBANI, THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>TALIBAN DELEGATION AND CHIEF OF THE "CARETAKER COUNCIL" IN KABUL, </p><p>HAD MET WITH A SAUDI OFFICIAL NAMED "NAYIF," BUT DENIED THAT THE </p><p>QUESTION OF BIN LADEN HAD BEEN RAISED.  (NOTE:  WE DO NOT KNOW </p><p>WHETHER HUSSAINI WAS REFERRING TO NAYIF SAUD, THE SAUDI MINISTER OF </p><p>INTERIOR;  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM LOCALLY WHETHER NAYIF </p><p>SAUD WAS A MEMBER THE SAUDI DELEGATION.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) HUSSAINI ALSO TOLD US THAT NOT TOO MUCH SHOULD BE READ INTO </p><p>OMAR\'S REMARKS; "THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY SHIFT IN POLICY BY THE </p><p>TALIBAN.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER HIM (BIN LADEN) SHELTER, BUT HE </p><p>MUST ABIDE BY OUR RULES."  (NOTE:  THE TALIBAN HAVE TOLD EMBOFFS ON </p><p>SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT BIN LADEN CAN STAY IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT </p><p>SHOULD NOT ENGAGE IN "TERRORIST ACTIVITIES" WHILE THERE.)  HUSSAINI </p><p>ADDED THAT BIN LADEN SHOULD CONSIDER OMAR\'S COMMENTS A "WARNING." </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH SAUDI DIPLOMAT </p><p>---------------------------/ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN A MARCH 27 MEETING WITH POLOFF, HAMZA GASSAS, A </p><p>POLITICAL OFFICER AT THE SAUDI ARABIAN EMBASSY, STATED THAT HE IS </p><p>"UNSURE OF WHAT TO MAKE OF OMAR\'S COMMENTS."  SOME OF THE PRESS </p><p>ARTICLES INDICATED THAT THE TALIBAN ARE BECOMING MORE CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT BIN LADEN, WHICH WOULD BE POSITIVE, HE CONTINUED.  HOWEVER, </p><p>OMAR\'S COMMENTS THAT U.S. TROOPS SHOULD NOT BE STATIONED IN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA WERE OF CONCERN, HE RELATED.  QUERIED WHETHER A TALIBAN </p><p>DELEGATION HAD IN FACT MET WITH SAG REPRESENTATIVES ON THE MARGINS </p><p>OF THE OIC SUMMIT, GASSAS RESPONDED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW, BUT DID </p><p>NOT THINK THAT THEY HAD MET WITH CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH, WHO HEADED </p><p>THE SAUDI DELEGATION.  GASSAS SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER NAYIF </p><p>SAUD WAS A MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION, AND CONCLUDED BY PROMISING TO </p><p>LOOK INTO THE ISSUE FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------/ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) BASED ON HUSSAINI\'S COMMENTS AND THE PRESS REPORTS, IT </p><p>APPEARS THAT THE TALIBAN MAY BE WORRIED ABOUT BIN LADEN\'S RECENT </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND THE REACTION THEY ARE PROVOKING FROM THE SAUDIS </p><p>AND/OR THE U.S.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, IT IS FAR FROM CERTAIN </p><p>THAT THE TALIBAN ARE FEELING THE HEAT ON THIS ISSUE DIRECTLY FROM </p><p>THE SAUDIS, AS SOME OF THE PRESS STORIES HERE SUGGEST.  WE WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO PROBE IN AN ATTEMPT TO LEARN WHO SAID WHAT TO WHOM ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMONS </p><p></p></div>
