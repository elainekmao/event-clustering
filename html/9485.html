<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001230 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MOPS, PINS, EPET, PGOV, NI, TP </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S INITIAL RESPONSE TO COUP IN SAO </p><p>TOME </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By A/DCM Brian L. Browne. Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador Jeter talked separately to Sao </p><p>Tomean President de Menezes and new Nigerian Foreign </p><p>Minister Adeniji July 16.  According to both sources, </p><p>President Obasanjo has been in direct communication </p><p>with the coup leaders, telling them to stand down and </p><p>return power to the country\'s constitutional, duly </p><p>elected authorities.  The GON also issued a statement, </p><p>through the Foreign Ministry, strongly condemning the </p><p>coup. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) As timing would have it, de Menezes was not the </p><p>only Head of State in Abuja for the Sullivan Summit. </p><p>During serial addresses before the Summit on July 16, </p><p>several African Heads of State denounced the coup and </p><p>called for restoration of the elected government.  AU </p><p>Chairman President Chissano and ECOWAS Chairman </p><p>President Kufuor were among those condemning the </p><p>takeover.  Zimbabwe\'s Mugabe even joined the chorus. </p><p>Senegalese President Wade offered the vague suggestion </p><p>that ECOWAS take action, although Sao Tome is outside </p><p>the formal ECOWAS ambit. The Summit has been a </p><p>convenient if coincidental venue, particularly with </p><p>the attendance of the AU Chairman, for Heads of State </p><p>to confer about the coup.  As a possible indication </p><p>that the Heads of State continued to meet, the </p><p>presidential addresses scheduled on July 17 for the </p><p>Summit, were cancelled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Chief of Defense Staff General Ogomudia and the </p><p>Service Chiefs met yesterday to discuss the coup.  We </p><p>have not gotten a read-out of the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
