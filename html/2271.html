THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\' DECEMBER 4 PASSAGE </p><p>    OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT </p><p>   (ZDERA) WAS FRONT-PAGE NEWS IN ZIMBABWE ON DECEMBER 6. </p><p> </p><p>2.   GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY "THE HERALD" GAVE THE STORY </p><p>   ABOVE-THE-FOLD PLAY UNDER THE HEADLINE "ANTI-ZIM BILL </p><p>   PASSED."  THE REPORT BLAMES THE OPPOSITION MDC PARTY, </p><p>   COMMERCIAL FARMERS, "SOME LOCAL INDUSTRIALISTS," THE </p><p>   BRITISH, AND "RIGHTWINGERS" FOR THE BILL\'S PASSAGE. </p><p>   FORMER US AMBASSADOR TO THE UN ANDREW YOUNG IS QUOTED </p><p>   IN THE STORY A SAYING THAT THE BILL IS "IRONIC IN THAT </p><p>   AT ITS FOUNDING AMERICA NEVER RECOGNIZED THE LAND </p><p>   PROGRAM GIVEN TO IT BY KING GEORGE III.  INSTEAD, </p><p>   AMERICA WROTE AND ASSERTED HER OWN LAND POLICY." </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" </p><p>   GAVE THE ISSUE TWO FRONT-PAGE PLACEMENTS" A STRAIGHT </p><p>   NEWS STORY UNDER THE TITLE "US CONGRESS PASSES ZIMBABWE </p><p>   SANCTIONS" AND A RELATIVELY RARE PAGE-ONE EDITORIAL </p><p>   UNDER THE TITLE "NOOSE TIGHTENS ON PRESIDENT.  THE NEWS </p><p>   STORY PROVIDED A STRAIGHT ACCOUNT OF THE BILL, LEAVENED </p><p>   WITH QUOTES FROM CONGRESSMEN ROYCE AND LANTOS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   IN ITS FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL THE "FINANCIAL </p><p>   GAZETTE" COMMENTED:  "THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE </p><p>   INTERNATIONAL TIDE IS RISING AND NOW THREATENS TO SWEEP </p><p>   AWAY PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE AND HIS REPRESSIVE REGIME. </p><p>   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THIS WEEK PASSED THE ZDERA THAT </p><p>   WILL UNLEASH SMART SANCTIONS AGAINST MUGABE AND THE </p><p>   POWERFUL CLIQUE OF SENIOR ZANU PF OFFICIALS AROUND HIM. </p><p>   . .  BUT GIVEN THE STUBBORN NATURE OF ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>   LEADERS, THERE REALLY IS NO HOPE THAT MUGABE AND HIS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03651  071031Z </p><p>   BAND OF MERRY MEN WILL RESPECT THE WISHES OF THE </p><p>   INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ALLOW A FREE AND FAIR POLL </p><p>   AND RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW.  WHAT IS MOST LIKELY IS </p><p>   THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN LEADER WILL DEFY ALL EFFORTS TO </p><p>   RESOLVE CONCERNS ABOUT HIS MISRULE AND, LIKE OSAMA BIN </p><p>   LADEN, BECOME AN INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE. </p><p>   TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR MUGABE AND ZANU PF BECAUSE THE </p><p>   INTERNATIONAL TIDE AGAINST THEIR REPRESSIVE RULE IS </p><p>   RISING AND RISING VERY FAST.  AND THE NOOSE IS </p><p>   TIGHTENING." </p><p> </p><p>5.   THE PRIVATELY OWNED DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" </p><p>   PUBLISHED THE STORY ON PAGE TWO UNDER THE TITLE </p><p>   "ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY BILL REACHES WATERSHED."  THAT </p><p>   REPORT WAS FACTUAL, OFFERING A SUMMARY OF THE BILL, AND </p><p>   QUOTES FROM CONGRESSMAN ED ROYCE.  THE ARTICLE ALSO </p><p>   OFFERED REACTIONS TO THE BILL FROM ZANU-PF SPOKESMAN </p><p>   NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA AND MDC SPOKESMAN LEARNMORE JONGWE. </p><p> </p><p>6.   ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION RADIO AND TV </p><p>   ALSO GAVE ZDERA PROMINENT COVERAGE.  REPORTS WERE </p><p>   GENERALLY FACTUAL, BUT SOUGHT TO BLAME THE OPPOSITION </p><p>   AND OTHER PERCEIVED ENEMIES OF THE RULING PARTY FOR </p><p>   PROMOTING THE BILL.  INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO </p><p>   DOWNPLAYED THE BILL, DESCRIBING IT AS A "TEMPEST IN A </p><p>   TEAPOT" DURING A ZBC TV INTERVIEW. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p></div>
