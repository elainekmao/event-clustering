(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR JAMES BRUNO; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION: OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS, IN </p><p>THE RUN-UP TO THE JUST-COMPLETED NINTH COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, VIETNAM\'S OUTGOING POLITBURO MEMBERS WERE </p><p>PORTRAYED IN STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA AS UNITED IN THE </p><p>PARTY\'S EFFORTS TO RALLY SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM OF THE </p><p>CONGRESS.  BEHIND THE SCENES, THOUGH, A FIERCE INTERNAL </p><p>STRUGGLE RAGED THAT RESULTED IN THE REPLACEMENT OF GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY PHIEU AND SIX OTHER POLITBURO MEMBERS (REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DURING THIS PERIOD, ALL SENIOR LEADERS JOURNEYED AROUND THE </p><p>COUNTRY TO ATTEND PROVINCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CONGRESSES. </p><p>SOME OF THESE LEADERS, SUCH AS DEPUTY PM CAM AND HO CHI </p><p>MINH ACADEMY HEAD BINH, CLEARLY RECOGNIZED AND ACCEPTED </p><p>THEY WERE WINDING UP THEIR POLITBURO CAREERS.  OTHERS, </p><p>HOWEVER, SUCH AS PHIEU, FATHERLAND FRONT LEADER DUYET, </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER TRA, AND ARMY POLITICAL COMMISSAR NGAN, </p><p>WOULD HAVE KNOWN THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR THEIR POLITICAL </p><p>LIVES.  BY CONTRAST, THE OTHER RISING STARS OF THE CPV -- </p><p>SUCH AS SOUTHERN REFORMERS TRIET AND DUNG, AS WELL AS </p><p>NORTHERN IDEOLOGUE TRONG -- WERE CONSOLIDATING THEIR </p><p>POSITIONS CONFIDENT THEY WOULD BE LEFT STANDING. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY (CONT\'D): NOW THAT A NEW LINEUP HAS BEEN </p><p>REVEALED, IT IS INSTRUCTIVE TO ANALYZE WHAT BROUGHT THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP TO THIS POINT, AND HOW THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00985  01 OF 07  251102Z </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE LARGELY SECRETIVE POLITBURO CONTRIBUTED </p><p>TO THE FALL OR MAINTENANCE IN POWER OF ITS INDIVIDUAL </p><p>MEMBERS.  IN PARTICULAR, WE SEE THE RISE IN RANK OF TRIET </p><p>AND DUNG AS FORETELLING THEIR SOON-EMERGENCE AS THE </p><p>CHAMPIONS OF REFORM AT THE MOST SENIOR RANKS.  THIS CABLE </p><p>IS THE SECOND OF A TWO-PART SERIES DOCUMENTING THE PUBLIC </p><p>APPEARANCES OF POLITBURO MEMBERS IN THE OFFICIAL VIETNAMESE </p><p>PRINT MEDIA SINCE OCTOBER 1, 2000.  (REF A ANALYZED THE NEW </p><p>LEADERSHIP LINEUP, AND REF B INCLUDED DETAILED PROFILES OF </p><p>PHIEU AND HIS SUCCESSOR, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN NONG </p><p>DUC MANH.)  THIS CABLE ANALYZES THE REMAINING 16 MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE OUTGOING POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>"PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FACES" OF THE OUTGOING POLITBURO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) WITH THE NEW POLITBURO AND CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED APRIL 22, IT IS AN INSTRUCTIVE MOMENT </p><p>TO ANALYZE WHAT BROUGHT THE SECRETIVE VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP </p><p>TO THIS POINT.  AS PART OF THE EMBASSY\'S ONGOING TRACKING </p><p>PROJECT OF THE PUBLIC FACES OF THE POLITBURO IN THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE MEDIA OVER THE PAST YEAR, WE HAVE DOCUMENTED THE </p><p>APPEARANCES OF THE MOST SENIOR COMMUNIST PARTY (CPV) </p><p>MEMBERS IN VIETNAM\'S MAJOR DAILY PAPERS.  WE HAVE FOCUSED </p><p>PARTICULARLY ON THE CPV MOUTHPIECE "NHAN DAN" (THE PEOPLE) </p><p>AND TWO LEADING DAILIES IN THE LARGEST CITIES: "NEW HANOI" </p><p>AND "SAIGON LIBERATION."  WHILE NOT A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>LISTING, THIS GIVES US A GOOD SURVEY OF HOW THE LEADERSHIP </p><p>IS FEATURED IN THE MOST PROMINENT OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00985  01 OF 07  251102Z </p><p>5. (SBU) IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, FROM OCTOBER 1-MARCH 31, </p><p>IN THE RUN-UP TO THE NINTH COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS, WE </p><p>CONTINUED TO SEE THE SAME TRENDS DOCUMENTED PREVIOUSLY: </p><p>ROUGHLY HALF OF THE POLITBURO HAVE POSITIONS WITH LARGELY </p><p>"PUBLIC" FACES THAT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT APPEARANCES IN THE </p><p>PUBLIC EYE, WHILE THE OTHER HALF WORK LARGELY OUT OF THE </p><p>PUBLIC EYE IN POSITIONS DEALING WITH INTERNAL CPV AFFAIRS. </p><p>FOR THIS ANALYSIS, WE EXAMINED THE LEADERSHIP IN THE </p><p>FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: </p><p> </p><p>-- A) "THE ONCE AND FUTURE LEADERS" WHO THROUGHOUT THE PAST </p><p>YEAR HAVE OCCUPIED THE TOP SLOTS, HAVE HAD HIGH PUBLIC </p><p>VISIBILITY, AND CONTINUE TO HAVE IMPORTANT POSITIONS IN THE </p><p>NEW POLITBURO; </p><p> </p><p>-- B) "SENIOR RETIRING PUBLIC FIGURES" WHO WERE THE </p><p>OUTGOING POLITBURO ELDERS WITH HAD RELATIVELY HIGH PUBLIC </p><p>PROFILES, BUT BECAUSE OF AGE, HEALTH AND/OR POOR </p><p>PERFORMANCE WERE REPLACED AT THE CONGRESS; </p><p> </p><p>-- C) "CONTINUING POLITBURO MEMBERS WITH LOW PUBLIC </p><p>PROFILES" WHO REMAINED IN THE POLITBURO DESPITE LOW PUBLIC </p><p>PROFILES; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- D) "MEMBERS WITH LOW PUBLIC PROFILES WHO WERE REPLACED," </p><p>WHO INCLUDE THOSE POLITBURO MEMBERS WHO WERE ONLY RARELY </p><p>FEATURED IN THE MEDIA AND WHO WERE RETIRED AT THE CPV </p><p>CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>OTHER "ONCE AND FUTURE LEADERS" </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) TRAN DUC LUONG, 63, THE STATE PRESIDENT, MAINTAINED </p><p>HIS SECOND-RANKED POSITION IN THE NEW POLITBURO LINEUP. </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN GREAT SPECULATION IN RECENT MONTHS ABOUT </p><p>WHETHER LUONG WOULD SURVIVE IN POWER OR EVEN BE PROMOTED TO </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY; IN THE END, THIS STEADY IF UNSPECTACULAR </p><p>OFFICIAL REMAINED IN PLACE.  LUONG, WHO WAS FEATURED ON 64 </p><p>OCCASIONS IN THE OFFICIAL PRESS DURING THE OCTOBER-MARCH </p><p>PERIOD, WAS GENERALLY PRESENTED IN PROTOCOL SITUATIONS </p><p>GREETING FOREIGN LEADERS, THOUGH HE TOO (LIKE ALL OTHER </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBERS) ATTENDED PROVINCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>CPV CONGRESSES THROUGHOUT THE FALL.  LIKE PHIEU, LUONG </p><p>FIGURED PROMINENTLY IN COVERAGE OF HANOI\'S 990TH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY IN EARLY OCTOBER.  HE RECEIVED ASEAN </p><p>INFORMATION MINISTERS (OCT. 13); MET PRESIDENT CLINTON </p><p>(NOV. 17); VISITED CHINA AND MET WITH JIANG ZEMIN, ZHU </p><p>RONGJI AND LI PENG (DEC. 25-29); RECEIVED THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER (FEB. 6), THE SINGAPOREAN PRESIDENT (FEB. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00985  02 OF 07  251103Z </p><p>8), THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (MARCH 2) AND THE THAI FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER (MARCH 8).  HIS SCHEDULED TRIP TO CAMBODIA WAS </p><p>ABORTED BECAUSE THE BORDER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES REMAINED INTRACTABLE.  HE LIKEWISE VISITED </p><p>FLOODED REGIONS OF THE MEKONG DELTA AND CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>IN LATE OCTOBER, ATTENDED THE HANOI AND HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>CPV CONGRESSES, ADDRESSED THE NGHE AN PARTY CONGRESS (JAN. </p><p>19), AND WAS FEATURED ATTENDING THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>PLENUMS.  NOW THAT THE CONGRESS HAS CONCLUDED, RUMORS </p><p>CIRCULATE THAT LUONG COULD BE SWITCHED TO NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>CHAIRMAN NEXT MONTH, WITH MANH TAKING THE COMBINED </p><p>POSITIONS OF GENERAL SECRETARY AND PRESIDENT.  (HOWEVER, IT </p><p>SEEMS MORE LIKELY DUNG, TRIET OR AN WOULD MOVE TO THIS </p><p>POST.)  OTHER REPORTS SUGGEST LUONG MAY REMAIN IN PLACE FOR </p><p>A YEAR OR TWO, AND THEN REPLACED, LIKE KHAI, BY A YOUNGER </p><p>COLLEAGUE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI, WHO IS 67, WAS THE </p><p>OLDEST SENIOR LEADER TO SURVIVE PAST THE PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p>RANKED THIRD IN BOTH THE OLD AND NEW CPV RANKS, KHAI WAS </p><p>WIDELY ASSUMED TO BE ON HIS WAY OUT DURING MUCH OF THE PAST </p><p>SIX MONTHS.  HE OFFERED TO RESIGN TWICE IN THE PAST YEAR </p><p>AND SEEMED DISPIRITED AND BLASE IN MANY OF HIS OFFICIAL </p><p>APPEARANCES WE WITNESSED.  (COMMENT: IN RETROSPECT, WE </p><p>SURMISE HIS LONG BITTER CONFLICT WITH PHIEU MAY HAVE LED TO </p><p>HIS DEEP FRUSTRATION, AND IN THE POST-PHIEU ERA, KHAI MAY </p><p>HAVE A CHANCE FOR A NEW RENAISSANCE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>DESPITE KHAI\'S FRUSTRATIONS, DURING THE PAST SIX MONTHS HE </p><p>KEPT A BUSY SCHEDULE BEFITTING THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p>FEATURED 71 TIMES IN THE PRESS, HE WAS DEPICTED CHAIRING </p><p>THE INTERAGENCY GOVERNMENT COUNCIL IN ITS MONTHLY MEETINGS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00985  02 OF 07  251103Z </p><p>AND HE WAS PICTURED AT THE OPENING OF THE PLENUM MEETINGS </p><p>OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THE OPENING OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY SESSION IN OCTOBER.  HE CHAIRED MEETINGS TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE CONSEQUENCES OF FLOODING IN SOUTHERN PROVINCES </p><p>AND TO SPUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL REGIONS.  HE GAVE </p><p>THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS TO THE HO CHI MINH CITY PARTY CONGRESS </p><p>DEC. 19, ATTENDED THE HANOI CONGRESS DEC. 27, ADDRESSED THE </p><p>PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES PARTY CONGRESS JAN. 4, AND SPOKE TO </p><p>THE VIETNAM FATHERLAND FRONT MEETING IN HCMC IN FEBRUARY. </p><p>HE HOSTED VISITING PRIME MINISTERS AND PRESIDENTS FROM </p><p>LUXEMBOURG, ALGERIA, INDIA, AND RUSSIA, AS WELL AS THE </p><p>UNESCO DIRECTOR GENERAL, AND HE MET WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON </p><p>IN NOVEMBER.  ON NOVEMBER 24 HE REPRESENTED VIETNAM AT THE </p><p>4TH INFORMAL ASEAN SUMMIT.  HE MADE PROVINCIAL WORKING </p><p>VISITS TO HAIPHONG, YEN BAI, HA NAM, BA RIA-VUNG TAU, DONG </p><p>NAI, SON LA, AND LAI CHAU, THE LATTER WHERE HE TOURED </p><p>EARTHQUAKE-STRICKEN AREAS.  (COMMENT: FROM KHAI\'S RATHER </p><p>PERFUNCTORY APPEARANCES IN PUBLIC OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS, </p><p>ONE WOULD NOT HAVE PREDICTED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO HE WOULD </p><p>SURVIVE PAST THE CONGRESS.  IN THE END, THE BACKROOM </p><p>POLITICKING THAT BROUGHT MANH TO POWER AND DUMPED HIS </p><p>NEMESIS PHIEU LEFT KHAI STANDING AT THE END OF THE </p><p>BLOODLETTING.  END COMMENT.)  A NUMBER OF SOURCES, </p><p>INCLUDING FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR VO VAN KIET, HAVE SUGGESTED </p><p>KHAI WILL REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL NEXT YEAR, PERHAPS THE </p><p>FALL, WHEN A NEW PRIME MINISTER IS EXPECTED TO BE NAMED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) HO CHI MINH CITY COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN MINH </p><p>TRIET, 58, WAS PROMOTED TO FOURTH IN THE NEW POLITBURO </p><p>RANKINGS, FROM HIS PREVIOUS POSITION OF SIXTEENTH OF 18. </p><p>CONSISTENTLY RANKED WITH ASSEMBLY SPEAKER NONG DUC MANH AS </p><p>ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR LEADERS IN THE POLITBURO, TRIET </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE BENEFITED FROM HIS POPULARITY AMONG </p><p>SOUTHERN REFORMERS, INCLUDING SENIOR ADVISOR VO VAN KIET, </p><p>WHO PRESSED HIM AS A POSSIBLE GENERAL SECRETARY.  TRIET WAS </p><p>FEATURED 29 TIMES IN NATIONAL MEDIA.  LIKE HANOI PARTY </p><p>CHIEF TRONG, HE PRESIDED OVER DISTRICT CONGRESSES OF THE </p><p>HCMC PARTY LEADING UP TO HIS READING OF THE DRAFT POLITICAL </p><p>REPORT AT THE DECEMBER 19 CITY CONGRESS, AND HE SPOKE AT </p><p>SEVERAL OF THE CITY\'S DISTRICT MILITARY CONGRESSES AS WELL. </p><p>DECEMBER 23 HE WAS FORMALLY REELECTED CHAIR OF THE HCMC </p><p>PARTY.  HE RECEIVED VISITING DELEGATIONS FROM THE CHINESE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER.  TRIET REVIEWED </p><p>THE ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAMS OF HIS CITY, VISITED FLOOD- </p><p>STRICKEN PROVINCES ON THE CITY\'S OUTSKIRTS IN OCTOBER, MET </p><p>WITH THE CPV YOUTH REPRESENTATIVES, MADE A SPEECH </p><p>COMMEMORATING THE CPV\'S FOUNDING IN FEBRUARY, AND WELCOMED </p><p>THE FATHERLAND FRONT AND CONSTITUENT GROUPS FOR MEETINGS IN </p><p>HCMC.  ACCORDING TO SOME SOURCES, TRIET HAS BEEN DESIGNATED </p><p>AS THE LIKELY SUCCESSOR TO KHAI AS PRIME MINISTER.  (THE </p><p>OTHER PRIME CANDIDATE IS DEPUTY PM DUNG, WHO ALSO WAITS IN </p><p>THE WINGS AS A YOUNG SOUTHERN REFORMER.  BECAUSE TRIET AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00985  03 OF 07  251103Z </p><p>DUNG HAVE SIMILAR PEDIGREES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT EXPECTED </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL CHANGES TO BE ANNOUNCED BY THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY NEXT MONTH MAY SUGGEST WHO IS THE BEST-POSITIONED </p><p>"HEIR" TO KHAI.)  REPORTS CIRCULATE THAT TRIET (OR DUNG) </p><p>MAY MOVE TO REPLACE MANH AS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN. </p><p>BOTH INCUMBENT PM KHAI AND HIS PREDECESSOR KIET FIRST </p><p>SERVED AS DEPUTY PM BEFORE MOVING UP, AND IF TRIET INDEED </p><p>IS BEING GROOMED FOR PM, HE MIGHT MOVE NEXT MONTH TO BECOME </p><p>FIRST DEPUTY PM. (UNDER THIS SCENARIO, DUNG MIGHT MOVE TO </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OR ANOTHER SENIOR POST.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG, 51, </p><p>RETURNING TO THE FIFTH-RANKING SLOT HE HELD THREE YEARS AGO </p><p>(BEFORE A NOMINAL "DEMOTION"), ALSO RANKS AS ONE OF THE </p><p>"NEXT GENERATION" OF LEADERS IN THE CPV.  HE PLAYED AN </p><p>IMPORTANT, BEHIND-THE-SCENES ROLE IN REACHING AGREEMENT TO </p><p>INITIAL THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. IN THE </p><p>SUMMER OF 1999, AND IN THAT, AND IN OTHER DIFFICULT ISSUES, </p><p>HE HAS PLAYED KEY "FIX-IT" ROLES TO GET THINGS DONE.  UNTIL </p><p>LAST YEAR HE SERVED AS ACTING HEAD OF THE STATE BANK AND </p><p>RECEIVED GENERALLY GOOD MARKS FOR HIS SERVICE, THOUGH HE </p><p>HAD NO BACKGROUND IN BANKING PRIOR TO THAT EXPERIENCE. </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER UNREST BROKE OUT FROM LARGE DEMONSTRATIONS IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IN EARLY FEBRUARY, DUNG WAS </p><p>DISPATCHED TO GIA LAI TO MONITOR AND HELP MANAGE THE </p><p>SITUATION ON THE GROUND.  WE KNOW LITTLE OF WHAT HE </p><p>ACTUALLY DID, AND THE VISIT WAS NOT REPORTED IN STATE </p><p>MEDIA.  HOWEVER, TO OUR EYE THESE ASSIGNMENTS REVEAL HE IS </p><p>A KEY MEMBER OF THE LEADERSHIP, THOUGH IT PPEARS HE HAS </p><p>BOTH STRONG SUPPORTERS AS WELL AS OPPONENTS AMONG THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  (SOME MAY RESENT HIS RAPID RISE: A POLITBURO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00985  03 OF 07  251103Z </p><p>MEMBER ONLY SINCE 1996, DUNG ROSE TO FIFTH IN THE CPV RANKS </p><p>BEFORE BEING BOUNCED TO 15TH IN THE FORMAL ORDER IN 1997 </p><p>AROUND THE TIME OF PHIEU\'S ASCENT TO POWER.  IT WILL BE </p><p>INTERESTING TO WATCH HOW DUNG FARES IN THE POST-PHIEU ERA.) </p><p>DURING THE TRACKING PERIOD, DUNG WAS FEATURED 34 TIMES, </p><p>LARGELY IN HIS ROLE AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER WITH A MAJOR </p><p>ROLE IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC AFFAIRS.  DUNG ACTS FOR PM KHAI AS </p><p>NEEDED; HE ROUTINELY READS THE GOVERNMENT\'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC </p><p>REPORT TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR ONE OF THE TWO SESSIONS </p><p>EACH YEAR, AND HE CO-CHAIRED THE GOVERNMENT\'S CABINET </p><p>MEETING IN OCTOBER.  HE CHAIRED A CONFERENCE ON DEALING </p><p>WITH FLOODS IN DONG THAP PROVINCE AND MEETINGS ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE 2001 BUDGET, AND HE HELD A WIDE VARIETY OF </p><p>MEETING WITH VISITING OFFICIALS, SUCH AS THE  DIRECTOR OF </p><p>THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.  HE VISITED QUANG NINH PROVINCE </p><p>WITH PHIEU IN OCTOBER, AND QUANG NGAI, DAKLAK, BINH PHUOC, </p><p>AND OTHER PROVINCES ON HIS OWN.  IN MID-MARCH HE CHAIRED A </p><p>CONFERENCE ON INVESTMENT IN VIETNAM, WHICH WAS ORGANIZED IN </p><p>SINGAPORE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) HANOI COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN PHU TRONG, 56, </p><p>PROMOTED TO SEVENTH IN POLITBURO RANKS, WAS ON THE SHORT </p><p>LIST FOR GENERAL SECRETARY.  BUT IN THE END, TRONG, WHO </p><p>FORMALLY WAS LAST IN THE PREVIOUS POLITBURO, MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONSIDERED NOT EXPERIENCED ENOUGH FOR THE TOP POST.  ONE OF </p><p>THE POLITBURO\'S MORE IDEOLOGICAL MEMBERS, HAVING SERVED AS </p><p>HEAD OF IDEOLOGICAL AFFAIRS AND AS EDITOR OF THE "COMMUNIST </p><p>REVIEW" JOURNAL, TRONG APPEARS TO BE IN THE MOLD OF FORMER </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU.  HE MAY YET BE DESTINED FOR HIGHER </p><p>THINGS, DEPENDING ON THE STRENGTH OF THE MORE IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>FACTION WITHIN THE NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  TRONG WAS </p><p>DEPICTED ON 35 DATES IN "THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY."  HE PLAYED A </p><p>PROMINENT NATIONAL ROLE IN HELPING OVERSEE THE DRAFTING AND </p><p>EDITING OF THE POLITICAL REPORT, ONE OF THE SEMINAL </p><p>DOCUMENTS THAT WAS PRESENTED AT THE PARTY CONGRESS APRIL </p><p>19.  TRONG PRESIDED OVER MEETINGS OF THE HANOI PARTY </p><p>COMMITTEE AND ATTENDED DISTRICT CONGRESSES OF THE HANOI CPV </p><p>LEADING UP TO HIS OPENING OF THE CITY\'S CONGRESS DECEMBER </p><p>13 AND HIS READING OF THE DRAFT POLITICAL REPORT TO THE </p><p>HANOI PARTY GATHERING ON DEC. 27.  TRONG WAS PRIMARILY </p><p>DEPICTED IN THE MEDIA MANAGING THE AFFAIRS OF THE HANOI </p><p>PARTY AND INVOLVED IN CITY ISSUES.  HE PRESIDED OVER </p><p>OCTOBER FESTIVITIES FOR THE 990TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE </p><p>FOUNDING OF HANOI; HELD WORKING SESSIONS WITH THE HANOI </p><p>LABOR DEPARTMENT, WITH THE RED CROSS (CONCERNING FLOOD </p><p>PREVENTION IN THE RED RIVER DELTA), WITH PROTESTANT AND </p><p>CATHOLIC LEADERS IN THE CITY, AND WITH CPV YOUTH UNION AND </p><p>OTHER SECTORAL GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>SENIOR PUBLIC FIGURES WHO RETIRED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00985  04 OF 07  251104Z </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) FATHERLAND FRONT CHAIRMAN PHAM THE DUYET, 64, WHO </p><p>WAS DROPPED FROM THE POLITBURO AFTER BEING RANKED FIFTH </p><p>PREVIOUSLY, WAS FEATURED ON 33 DATES DURING THE TRACKING </p><p>PERIOD.  DUYET BATTLED REPORTS OF MISMANAGEMENT AND </p><p>CORRUPTION THROUGHOUT THE PAST THREE YEARS.  HE MAY </p><p>MAINTAIN HIS ROLE AS HEAD OF THE VIETNAM FATHERLAND FRONT </p><p>(VFF), THE UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION THAT OVERSEES THE </p><p>CONSTITUENT SECTORAL GROUPS THAT THE CPV USES TO MANAGE AND </p><p>CHANNEL NON-GOVERNMENTAL VIETNAMESE GROUPS.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>FACT HE WAS ALSO DROPPED FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>SUGGESTS HE MAY NOT HOLD THAT POSITION FOR LONG.  DUYET\'S </p><p>PRIMARY PUBLIC ACTIVITIES WERE CONNECTED WITH GROUPS AND </p><p>PROGRAMS OF THE VFF, SUCH AS THE FARMER\'S UNION, MASS </p><p>MOBILIZATION ACTIVITIES, THE OCTOBER 17 "DAY OF THE POOR," </p><p>THE WOMEN\'S UNION, THE YOUTH UNION, AND THE CPV MOUTHPIECE </p><p>"NHAN DAN" (THE PEOPLE).  HE ALSO MET WITH THE HANOI </p><p>CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP AND LEADERS OF THE NORTHERN PROTESTANT </p><p>CHURCHES JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, AND BUDDHIST LEADERS AROUND </p><p>IMPORTANT FESTIVAL DAYS.  KNOWN AS THE POLITBURO\'S </p><p>"TROUBLESHOOTER," DUYET JOURNEYED TO THAI BINH (SITE OF </p><p>MASS PROTESTS THREE YEARS AGO THAT HE SERVED TO HELPED </p><p>CONTROL) IN OCTOBER FOR A HISTORICAL ANNIVERSARY OF THE </p><p>PROVINCE; THERE HE WAS INTERVIEWED AT LENGTH ON THE CPV\'S </p><p>MASS MOBILIZATION ACTIVITIES.  IN THE SPRING HE MADE A </p><p>WIDELY PUBLICIZED VISIT TO THE HIGHLANDS PROVINCES OF GIA </p><p>LAI AND DAKLAK, SITE OF FEBRUARY PROTESTS.  (DEPUTY PM </p><p>DUNG\'S VISIT SHORTLY AFTER THE PROTESTS BROKE OUT, BY </p><p>CONTRAST, WAS NOT REPORTED IN THE STATE PRESS AT THE TIME.) </p><p>DUYET ALSO ATTENDED DISTRICT AND PROVINCIAL PARTY </p><p>CONGRESSES IN VINH PHU, HAI DUONG, QUANG NAM, HAIPHONG, BAC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00985  04 OF 07  251104Z </p><p>NINH, AND THE PROVINCIAL PARTY CONGRESS IN DANANG IN </p><p>FEBRUARY. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN MANH CAM, 71, WAS </p><p>FEATURED IN THE MEDIA ON 62 OCCASIONS.  SINCE BEING </p><p>REPLACED BY NGUYEN DY NIEN AS FOREIGN MINISTER A YEAR AGO, </p><p>CAM WAS WIDELY SEEN AS BEING "KICKED UPSTAIRS" PRIOR TO HIS </p><p>RETIREMENT AT THE CONGRESS.  DESPITE THIS, HE MAINTAINED AN </p><p>ACTIVE SCHEDULE OF PUBLIC EVENTS AS HE REPRESENTED VIETNAM </p><p>AT HOME AND ABROAD, AND ALSO AT LEAST NOMINALLY OVERSAW </p><p>FOREIGN AND TRADE POLICY.  DURING THE PERIOD, CAM MET </p><p>SCORES OF VISITING MINISTERS, INCLUDING THOSE FROM THE </p><p>U.S., CHINA, ITALY, LAOS, CHILE AND JAPAN.  HE ATTENDED THE </p><p>ASEM III SUMMIT (MEETING THE SOUTH KOREAN AND SPANISH PRIME </p><p>MINISTERS, AMONG OTHERS) AND MET WITH VISITING FORMER </p><p>GENERAL DIRECTOR OF GATT DUNKEL.  CAM\'S MOST PROMINENT TRIP </p><p>OF THE PERIOD WAS ATTENDING THE APEC SUMMIT IN BRUNEI </p><p>NOVEMBER 14-18, WHERE HE MET WITH PRESIDENTS CLINTON, PUTIN </p><p>AND JIANG ON THE MARGINS AND OTHER OFFICIALS, INCLUDING </p><p>USTR AND U.S. CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>LIKELY FUTURE PLAYERS WITH LOW PUBLIC PROFILES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) CPV ORGANIZATIONAL AFFAIRS CHIEF NGUYEN VAN AN, 63, </p><p>WHO WAS FEATURED IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA ON ONLY 12 DIFFERENT </p><p>DATES, POSSESSES MUCH MORE CLOUT THAN HIS PUBLIC PROFILE </p><p>WOULD SUGGEST.  LIKE IN DECEMBER 1997, WHEN HE NARROWLY </p><p>LOST OUT TO PHIEU, AN WAS RUNNER-UP A SECOND TIME FOR THE </p><p>TOP JOB.  ACCORDING TO SEVERAL SOURCES, INCLUDING ONE </p><p>STAFF-LEVEL CONTACT AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AN IS RUMORED </p><p>TO BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED TO MOVE TO HEAD THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY (TAKING MANH\'S PLACE) BEGINNING IN MAY, WHICH </p><p>WOULD GIVE HIM A MUCH HIGHER PROFILE.  (IN THE NEW </p><p>POLITBURO, HOWEVER, HE WAS DROPPED TO TWELFTH, THE LOWEST </p><p>RANK OF ANY CONTINUING MEMBER, WHICH SUGGESTS ANOTHER </p><p>LEADER WITH PERHAPS MORE CLOUT, SUCH AS DUNG OR TRIET, MAY </p><p>BE DESTINED FOR THE ASSEMBLY.)  THROUGHOUT THE TRACKING </p><p>PERIOD, AN WAS RARELY FEATURED IN THE PRESS.  SOME OF HIS </p><p>APPEARANCES WERE PURELY PROTOCOL-BASED, SUCH AS WHEN HE </p><p>VISITED THE TOMB OF FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER LE DUC THO IN </p><p>OCTOBER.  OTHERS WERE MORE SUBSTANTIVE: HE DIRECTED </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL MEETINGS ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM CPV </p><p>CONGRESSES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND THE CENTRAL REGION, </p><p>AND HAS WAS FEATURED HOLDING CPV ORGANIZATIONAL MEETINGS AS </p><p>WELL.  IF HE DOES MOVE TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AN WOULD </p><p>FOR THE FIRST TIME EMERGE FROM THE CPV SHADOWS. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) CPV ECONOMIC COMMISSION HEAD TRUONG TAN SANG, 52, </p><p>FEATURED IN THE MEDIA ON ONLY 8 DATES, LIKEWISE IS A </p><p>POTENTIAL FUTURE PLAYER WHO NONETHELESS NOW MAINTAINS A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00985  05 OF 07  251104Z </p><p>VERY LOW PUBLIC PROFILE.  FORMERLY HCMC PARTY CHIEF, SANG, </p><p>LIKE DUNG AND TRIET, IS A YOUNG SOUTHERN REFORMER WHO MAY </p><p>BE DESTINED FOR HIGHER THINGS.  NOT CURRENTLY AS POPULAR AS </p><p>TRIET, SANG IS PRESENTLY IN A LOW-VISIBILITY JOB AS HEAD OF </p><p>THE CPV\'S LITTLE-KNOWN ECONOMIC COMMISSION.  THE FACT THAT </p><p>THE CPV SEEMS TO HAVE TILTED MORE TOWARD REFORM AT THE </p><p>NINTH CONGRESS MAY BE RELATED IN PART TO SANG\'S WORK. </p><p>(CONVERSELY, THE JAPANESE EMBASSY HEARD REPORTS PRIOR TO </p><p>THE CONGRESS THAT SANG WAS IN DANGER OF BEING DROPPED FROM </p><p>THE POLITBURO BECAUSE OF ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION.  IN ANY </p><p>EVENT, HE SURVIVED, THOUGH RELATIVE TO HIS PEERS HE DROPPED </p><p>SLIGHTLY IN RANK, WITH NEWCOMER LE HONG ANH, AS WELL AS </p><p>TRIET, DUNG, TRONG AND DIEN, ALL BYPASSING HIM IN THE </p><p>RANKS.)  DURING THE TRACKING PERIOD, HE ATTENDED PARTY </p><p>CONGRESSES IN BEN TRE AND OTHER PROVINCES, AND PRESIDED </p><p>OVER THE JANUARY CPV CONGRESS OF THE CENTRAL ECONOMIC </p><p>BRANCH. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) DEFENSE MINISTER SR. LT. GENERAL PHAM VAN TRA, 65, </p><p>NARROWLY HELD ON TO HIS POLITBURO SEAT, LIKELY IN LARGE </p><p>PART BECAUSE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF GOOD CANDIDATES TO </p><p>REPLACE HIM AS DEFENSE MINISTER.  (HE WAS DEMOTED TO </p><p>ELEVENTH OF 15, WHICH IS VERY LOW INDEED CONSIDERING THAT </p><p>NORMALLY ELDER MEMBERS OF THE POLITBURO ARE RANKED HIGHER </p><p>IN PROTOCOL RANKS.)  TRA IS THE ONLY MILITARY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE ON THE NEW 15-MEMBER POLITBURO, WHICH </p><p>HISTORICALLY IS UNPRECEDENTED IN VIETNAM.  TRA HIMSELF IS </p><p>WEAKENED POLITICALLY BECAUSE OF HIS RECENT CENSURE BY THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE FOR "MANAGEMENT FAILURES," IN PART FOR </p><p>ALLOWING LY TONG TO VIOLATE VIETNAMESE AIRSPACE.  TRA MAY </p><p>HAVE SURVIVED BECAUSE HE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE USE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00985  05 OF 07  251104Z </p><p>MILITARY INTELLIGENCE ASSETS TO SPY ON MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE, WHICH REPORTEDLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE </p><p>DEMISE OF PHIEU AND HIS PROTEGE NGAN.  (CONTRARILY, HE MAY </p><p>HAVE SURVIVED AS A TRADEOFF TO MAINTAIN SOME MILITARY </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE LEADERSHIP.)  DURING THE TRACKING PERIOD, </p><p>TRA WAS DEPICTED IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA ON 25 OCCASIONS, </p><p>LARGELY IN ATTENDING AND PRESIDING OVER MILITARY FUNCTIONS. </p><p>HE CO-CHAIRED THE REVIEW MEETING OF THE MILITARY PARTY </p><p>COMMITTEE IN FEBRUARY AND ATTENDED THE SOC TRONG PROVINCIAL </p><p>CPV CONGRESS.  IN FEBRUARY HE MET WITH THE VISITING CHINESE </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER WITH GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY LE MINH HUONG, 64, </p><p>SURVIVED IN HIS SECRET POLICE POST AND WAS PROMOTED TO </p><p>SIXTH IN THE NEW RANKS.  (THE AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY RECENTLY </p><p>HEARD ANOTHER REPORT FROM MPS CONTACTS THAT HUONG IS IN </p><p>POOR HEALTH, AND AN ANALYSIS OF THE NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>RANKS SUGGESTS MPS HAS FEWER MEMBERS IN SENIOR CPV RANKS. </p><p>HOWEVER, MPS REMAINS A POWERFUL FORCE IN VIETNAMESE </p><p>POLITICAL LIFE.) HUONG WAS DEPICTED IN THE MEDIA ON 13 </p><p>OCCASIONS, ATTENDING PROVINCIAL CONGRESSES IN THUA THIEN- </p><p>HUE AND QUANG TRI, AND ATTENDING THE FOUNDING THE YOUTH </p><p>UNION.  OVERALL, THOUGH, HIS ALMOST INVISIBLE PUBLIC </p><p>PROFILE DOES NOT MATCH HIS BEHIND-THE-SCENES INFLUENCE OR </p><p>THAT OF HIS MINISTRY IN VIETNAMESE LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) DANANG COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF PHAN DIEN, 63, IS </p><p>ALMOST INVISIBLE IN NATIONAL MEDIA, THOUGH THIS IS </p><p>MISLEADING.  HE WAS FEATURED IN PROMINENT COVERAGE ONLY </p><p>FIVE TIMES IN THE HANOI AND HO CHI MINH CITY MEDIA, THOUGH </p><p>HE OF COURSE RECEIVED MORE REGULAR COVERAGE IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>REGION/DANANG PRESS.  WE DO NOT REGULARLY MONITOR THE </p><p>REGIONAL PRESS FOR THIS PROJECT.  DIEN WAS DEPICTED IN </p><p>NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENDING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE </p><p>FOUNDING OF DANANG UNIVERSITY AND CHAIRING MEETINGS OF </p><p>PERSONNEL QUESTIONS FOR THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND SOCIO- </p><p>ECONOMIC PLANNING MEETINGS.  OBVIOUSLY, THE NATIONAL MEDIA </p><p>GIVE ONLY A THUMBNAIL SKETCH OF DIEN\'S ACTIVITIES; LIKE </p><p>TRONG AND TRIET (WHO HEAD THE COUNTRY\'S TWO LARGEST CITY </p><p>PARTY ORGANIZATIONS), DIEN PRESIDED OVER DISTRICT AND </p><p>PROVINCIAL CPV PREPARATIONS FOR THE PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p>HOWEVER, THESE ACTIVITIES RECEIVED SCANT ATTENTION IN </p><p>NATIONAL MEDIA.  HE WAS DEPICTED JOURNEYING TO QUANG NAM\'S </p><p>CPV CONGRESS IN MID-DECEMBER.  OVERALL, DESPITE HIS LOW </p><p>NATIONAL PROFILE, DIEN APPEARS TO HAVE A GOOD REPUTATION </p><p>AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES.  FOLLOWING THE MASSIVE FLOODING OF </p><p>TWO YEARS AGO IN THE CENTRAL REGION, THE CPV REPORTEDLY </p><p>DISPATCHED DIEN TO PROVIDE A STEADY HAND TO HELP THE REGION </p><p>RECOVER.  HE MAY RISE TO MORE PROMINENCE IN THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>MEMBERS WITH LOW PUBLIC PROFILES WHO RETIRED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00985  06 OF 07  251104Z </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) PAVN POLITICAL DIRECTOR LT. GENERAL PHAM THANH </p><p>NGAN\'S DROP FROM THE POLITBURO IS THE MOST STRIKING, THOUGH </p><p>HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PHIEU\'S PROTEGE.  AS NOTED </p><p>ABOVE AND DOCUMENTED IN DATT REPORTING, NGAN\'S FALL WITH </p><p>PHIEU APPEARS TO OWE IN LARGE PART TO THE MISUSE OF </p><p>MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AGAINST THEIR POLITBURO COLLEAGUES. </p><p>UNTIL RECENTLY NGAN, 62, WAS SEEN AS POTENTIALLY A RISING </p><p>STAR, WHO MIGHT FOLLOW PHIEU (AS A MILITARY POLITICAL </p><p>COMMISSAR) TO HIGHER RANKS IN THE CPV.  DURING THE TRACKING </p><p>PERIOD, HE WAS DEPICTED IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA 19 TIMES, </p><p>MOSTLY IN MILITARY CEREMONIAL FUNCTIONS.  HE CO-CHAIRED THE </p><p>REVIEW OF THE CPV MILITARY COMMITTEE IN FEBRUARY, ATTENDED </p><p>CEREMONIES HONORING MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE\'S ARMY, AND VISITED MILITARY UNITS AND HOSPITALS </p><p>DURING TET. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) HO CHI MINH POLITICAL ACADEMY DIRECTOR NGUYEN DUC </p><p>BINH, 73, WHO WAS FEATURED 20 TIMES IN NATIONAL MEDIA, HAS </p><p>BEEN SLATED FOR RETIREMENT FOR SOME TIME.  THE OLDEST </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBER, BINH SERVED FOR TEN YEARS IN THE HIGHEST </p><p>BODY.  HE HELD SOME INFLUENCE AS A CPV ELDER AND A FORMER </p><p>"TEACHER" FOR MOST OF HIS POLITBURO COLLEAGUES, SINCE MOST </p><p>OF THEM HAD PASSED THROUGH THE ACADEMY AS PART OF THEIR CPV </p><p>TRAINING.  ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, BINH WAS ONE OF THOSE </p><p>WHO HELPED PUT A BRAKE ON THE BTA 18 MONTHS AGO.  DURING </p><p>THIS PERIOD, HE HEADED UP AN IDEOLOGICAL CONFERENCE SHARING </p><p>LESSONS OF SOCIALIST DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN VIETNAM AND CHINA </p><p>IN NOVEMBER.  HE ATTENDED PARTY CONGRESSES IN HOA BINH, HA </p><p>TAY, AND YEN BAI. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00985  06 OF 07  251104Z </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) NGUYEN THI XUAN MY, 60, HEAD OF THE CPV CENTRAL </p><p>CONTROL DEPARTMENT, WAS DROPPED FROM SENIOR CPV RANKS </p><p>DESPITE BEING THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER SERVED IN THE </p><p>POLITBURO.  UNTIL RECENTLY THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WAS THAT </p><p>THE CPV WOULD WANT TO KEEP HER -- OR PROMOTE ANOTHER WOMAN </p><p>TO TAKE HER PLACE -- TO MAINTAIN A FACADE OF INCLUSIVENESS </p><p>AT THE TOP OF THE CPV.  HOWEVER, SHE WAS SHARPLY CRITICIZED </p><p>IN CPV RANKS FOR THE FAILURES OF THE CRITICISM/SELF- </p><p>CRITICISM CAMPAIGN AND CORRUPTION PROBLEMS IN PARTY RANKS. </p><p>SHE WAS FEATURED 16 TIMES IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA DURING THIS </p><p>PERIOD.  SHE DEALT WITH THE CENTRAL UNITS OF THE CPV AND </p><p>ATTENDED PARTY CONGRESSES IN VINH PHUC AND HUNG YEN </p><p>PROVINCES.  (NOTE: LABOR MINISTER NGUYEN THI HANG, WHO </p><p>MAINTAINED A CENTRAL COMMITTEE SEAT AT THE CONGRESS, IS </p><p>WIDELY MENTIONED AS A POSSIBLE VICE PRESIDENT, WHICH WOULD </p><p>PLACE HER AS THE COUNTRY\'S HIGHEST-RANKING WOMAN.  THOUGH </p><p>THE NEW 15-MEMBER POLITBURO HAS NO WOMEN, MS. TONG THI </p><p>PHONG, PARTY CHIEF OF SON LA PROVINCE, WAS NAMED TO THE </p><p>NINE-MEMBER POLITBURO SECRETARIAT.) </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) CPV IDEOLOGY CHIEF LE XUAN TUNG, 64, DEPICTED 24 </p><p>TIMES IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA, RETIRED AS LONG EXPECTED. </p><p>TUNG IS IN POOR HEALTH, AND HE WAS LUCKY TO HANG ON TO HIS </p><p>POLITBURO SEAT AFTER BEING BOOTED AS HANOI PARTY CHIEF 18 </p><p>MONTHS AGO.  DURING THE RATING PERIOD, TUNG SPOKE AT THE </p><p>PARTY CONGRESSES OF AGENCIES UNDER CENTRAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONTROL, AS WELL AS CPV CONGRESSES IN NAM DINH, THAI BINH, </p><p>AND NINH BINH.  HE HAS MAINTAINED A LOW PROFILE SINCE </p><p>ASSUMING HIS PRESENT ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) WITH THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD THIS PAST WEEKEND TO </p><p>A YOUNGER LEADERSHIP, IT IS STRIKING TO OBSERVE HOW MANY OF </p><p>THOSE WHO ADVANCED IN THE NEW POLITBURO -- ESPECIALLY MANH, </p><p>TRIET AND DUNG -- ARE AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE HAD "PUBLIC" </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HAVE ENABLED THEM TO BUILD BROADER </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES OF SUPPORT.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, THAT HAS </p><p>HELPED THEM WHEN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS HAS GONE PAST </p><p>THE POLITBURO TO THE BROADER CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  BUT ONE </p><p>CANNOT IGNORE THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE CONTINUING MAJOR </p><p>POWERS IN THIS SECRETIVE BODY -- HUONG AND AN FOR EXAMPLE - </p><p>- BIDE THEIR TIME IN THE SHADOWS.  WE WILL BE INTERESTED TO </p><p>OBSERVE WHETHER THE NEW POLITBURO WILL DIFFER FROM THE OLD </p><p>IN ITS CONTRASTING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FACES.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
