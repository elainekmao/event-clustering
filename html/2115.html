<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002759 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/25/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SU, XA, NI, IGAD </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  SPECIAL ADVISOR BUGAJE HOLDS HIGH </p><p>EXPECTAQTIONS FOR THE PLANNED ABUJA CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. NAIROBI 6602 </p><p>     B. CAIRO 6777 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: During a brief October 22 meeting, </p><p>Presidential Special Advisor Usman Bugaje said the November </p><p>12-17 conference on Sudan was on track.  He described the </p><p>"3-in-1" conference where the Southern and Northern groups </p><p>would first meet separately, then join in an all parties </p><p>session.  He contended the Nigerians were not pushing a </p><p>substantive agenda except that they opposed Southern </p><p>secession.  Abuja sought only to provide a forum where the </p><p>Sudanese could find their own way, he stated.  This </p><p>procedural-substantive dichotomy may work in the abstract but </p><p>in practice the line is blurred.  The composition of invitees </p><p>will influence the substantive agenda.  While the smaller </p><p>parties and factions may welcome this wider tent, the </p><p>perennial antagonists - Bashir and Garang -- might experience </p><p>a rare moment of agreement.  Both probably will not relish </p><p>sharing space around a negotiating table they now monopolize. </p><p> Despite these potential sticking points, we should encourage </p><p>the Nigerians in their effort.  However, gauging the </p><p>emanations from Cairo and Nairobi,  Bugaje may be </p><p>underestimating the difficulties inherent in the Nigerian </p><p>approach. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  During an October 23 meeting with PolCouns and </p><p>Poloff, Dr. Usman Bugaje stated the November 12-17 conference </p><p>was on track.  Bugaje, Abuja\'s point man on Sudan, said he </p><p>was traveling to London that very evening.  In London he </p><p>would meet with non-SPLA Southern opposition members October </p><p>23 in addition to seeing the Snyder/Oakley team October 24. </p><p>Bugaje, optimistic that Nigeria could push the Sudanese </p><p>process forward, outlined Abuja\'s "3-in-1" conference </p><p>scenario. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Bugaje\'s formulation differed from what NSA Mohammed </p><p>told us most recently.  Bugaje envisioned a meeting of all </p><p>Southern opposition groups, a separate session of all </p><p>Northern parties (including the government\'s party) and a </p><p>third meeting of all who participated in the first two </p><p>confabulations.  (Conversely, Mohammed told us the second </p><p>meeting would convene all the opposition groups.  We do not </p><p>know if Mohammed misspoke or if there is a disconnect among </p><p>the Nigerians.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Stressing that this formula was promising because it </p><p>promoted inclusivity,  Bugaje characterized both the IGAD </p><p>process and Egyptian-Libyan Initiative (ELI) as inert.  IGAD </p><p>had languished for nearly eight years with a controversial </p><p>document - the Declaration of Principles -- as its only noted </p><p>accomplishment, he declared.  Additionally he cited  IGAD as </p><p>structurally flawed because it only involved the SPLM and the </p><p>Bashir Government.  Bugaje contended other Southern armed </p><p>groups also controlled territory.  Although Garang\'s faction </p><p>was the largest,  marginalizing the other groups would prove </p><p>inimical.  They ultimately would be disruptive in order to </p><p>force a place at the table.  Bugaje also explained that </p><p>Southern political party leaders have threatened to take up </p><p>arms unless they were included in the process.  Overall, </p><p>other Southern groupings were tired of Garang\'s delaying </p><p>tactics.  Garang was footdragging because he was more </p><p>comfortable with the status quo than with the political </p><p>uncertainty that progress toward peace might sow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Bugaje characterized the ELI as stillborn, claiming </p><p>the partnership between Cairo and Tripoli could not advance </p><p>the peace process because the Cairo-Tripoli bilateral </p><p>relationship was marked more by contention than concord. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  The Nigerian Special Advisor predicted that the </p><p>Nigerian approach could cure the faults of the two other </p><p>initiatives.  By inviting all credible Sudanese parties, </p><p>including the Southern political organizations, the Nigerian </p><p>approach minimized the chance of minor parties uniting to </p><p>roll a boulder in the road because they were excluded from </p><p>peace talks.  Second, the Abuja conference would not impose a </p><p>solution; it simply provided a conducive venue.  Nigeria </p><p>neither endorsed nor opposed the substantive agendas of the </p><p>two other initiatives, he offered.  Abuja will let the </p><p>Sudanese decide; they can adhere to the DOP, the ELI formula </p><p>or choose a third stream, asserted Bugaje.  Nigeria\'s only </p><p>anathema was partition.  Given its own history of destructive </p><p>civil war, Nigeria would not "preside" over the dismantling </p><p>of another state, Bugaje stressed.  (Comment: While Bugaje \'s </p><p>statement was retrospective, we cannot but feel that </p><p>Nigeria\'s current ethno-religious maelstrom figures in </p><p>Abuja\'s squeamishness about secession as well.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  When asked whether Garang, whose personality houses </p><p>vast deposits of megalomania, accepted such a conference </p><p>arrangement that would seem to dilute his negotiating </p><p>position in the South and within the NDA.  Bugaje, contended </p><p>that "sufficient pressure" was being placed on Garang to make </p><p>him amenable.  However, Bugaje admitted that Nigeria must </p><p>delicately calibrate the numerical representation of the </p><p>other Southern parties to prevent them from acquiring a voice </p><p>exceeding their power and importance on the ground. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Bugaje was also certain that Bashir would send high </p><p>level negotiators and that Northern elements of the NDA would </p><p>be well represented.  When asked about the logic of an </p><p>all-northern meeting, Bugaje was momentarily nonplused.  He </p><p>then declared that the conferences were geographically </p><p>structured to reflect political realities.  Despite their </p><p>differences, the Northerners share a greater commonality of </p><p>interests notwithstanding the North/South makeup of the NDA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment:  Bugaje tried to outline a simple </p><p>straightforward approach.  His presentation was typical of </p><p>the Nigerian stratagem toward conflict resolution -- put the </p><p>parties in a room and let them hash it out; intervening only </p><p>to prevent a stalemate.  Nigeria\'s intrinsic importance and </p><p>Obasanjo\'s personal stature suggest Nigerian efforts to </p><p>gather the parties could possibly energize the peace process. </p><p> Because of these attributes, we should encourage the </p><p>Nigerians toward a constructive role.  However as the </p><p>preparations for the conference unfold, we must watch closely </p><p>that the formulation does not have the unintended </p><p>consequences of compounding Garang\'s recalcitrance and </p><p>escalating the North-South divide, testing the stability of </p><p>the NDA in the process. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
