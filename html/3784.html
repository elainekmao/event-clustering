<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002133 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION U.S. POLICY ON IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   U.S. policy toward Iraq was the favored topic of </p><p>      Zimbabwean op-ed writers over the Sept 21-22 weekend. </p><p>      While none of the writers defended Saddam Hussein, </p><p>      they were unanimously opposed to U.S. unilateral </p><p>      action in Iraq.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Bush, Blair playing games with </p><p>      Saddam" the independent daily "The Daily News" (09/23) </p><p>      carried the following op-ed by Tajudeen Abdul Raheem: </p><p> </p><p>      "President George W. Bush of the U.S. addressed </p><p>      the United Nations General Assembly 10 days ago. </p><p>      For a President infamous for mixing his tenses </p><p>      and mauling the English grammar. . .the speech </p><p>      was in clear English and delivered with a clear </p><p>      intention of leaving no one in any doubt: The UN </p><p>      must act decisively on Iraq or the U.S. will do </p><p>      it for the UN, whether the UN likes it or not. . </p><p>      .  For hawks. . .in his. . .administration and </p><p>      his small band of cheerleaders internationally </p><p>      (principally Tony Blair of Britain and Ariel </p><p>      Sharon of Israel), it was the kind of no- </p><p>      nonsense speech that they wanted. . .  Now that </p><p>      Saddam Hussein seems to have swallowed his fat </p><p>      ego and agreed that the weapons inspectors can </p><p>      return to Iraq unconditionally Bush and his </p><p>      British poodle, Blair, are unsure how to react. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The U.S. and the British have reacted to </p><p>      Iraq\'s offer with incredulity, insisting that </p><p>      Iraq is merely playing games and setting a trap </p><p>      for the UN that would give it room to wriggle </p><p>      out in the future after short-circuiting the </p><p>      momentum for military action.  If anybody is </p><p>      playing games it is Bush and Blair. . .  Bush </p><p>      did not go to the UN for approval.  He went </p><p>      there to inform them.  Not sure of the response </p><p>      he would get, he made sure (like a good cowboy) </p><p>      he held guns to their heads.  However, finding </p><p>      the UN amenable to its demands on the weapons </p><p>      inspectors, the Bush administration has been </p><p>      shifting the goal posts since the UN triumph. </p><p>      And whatever Saddam does, even if he opens his </p><p>      bedroom and bunker to the inspectors, Bush will </p><p>      still attack the country. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "First Afghanistan, now Iraq, then </p><p>      who?" the independent weekly "The Standard" (09/22) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ".We hold no brief for Saddam Hussein.  True, </p><p>      Iraq, has been defying a host of UN resolution </p><p>      dating back to the 1991 Gulf War, particularly </p><p>      those regarding weapons of mass destruction. </p><p>      But this defiance does not merit the fundamental </p><p>      evil of regime change.  Why only Iraq when it is </p><p>      common knowledge that Israel gets away literally </p><p>      with murder! </p><p> </p><p>      ".In the eyes of the world, there could be yet </p><p>      another dangerous precedent.  First Afghanistan, </p><p>      now Iraq.  Which country next?  Where will it </p><p>      all end?  Domino theory - knock them all down </p><p>      one by one!  The U.S. must not see the world </p><p>      from its selfish and parochial point of view. </p><p>      The U.S. must stop trying to deceive the world </p><p>      by claiming that getting rid of Saddam would be </p><p>      in the interest of the Iraqi people and their </p><p>      neighbors.  It is a load of crap. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The world was not found wanting when </p><p>      people watched in horror and disbelief as the </p><p>      World Trade Center fell to a vicious terrorist </p><p>      attack.  Joseph Sullivan, U.S. ambassador to </p><p>      Zimbabwe, said people understood that although </p><p>      the attacks took place in the U.S., they were an </p><p>      assault against the world.  Given this kind of </p><p>      cooperation and collective memory, the U.S. must </p><p>      not now act outside that world regarding the </p><p>      Iraq problem." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Bush\'s Iraq war all about oil" </p><p>      the September 22 edition of the independent weekly </p><p>      "The Standard" carried the following opinion piece by </p><p>      Ken Mafuka under his column "American Notes": </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Saddam Hussein is guilty of the most </p><p>      barbarous crimes against humanity.  He used </p><p>      chemical weapons against Iran in the 1980 war </p><p>      and later against the Kurds.  He is amassing </p><p>      weapons of mass destruction. . .  He invaded </p><p>      Kuwait and committed atrocities even against </p><p>      babies there.  All this is true but the juicy </p><p>      part is that he was encouraged by the U.S. and </p><p>      was given `material help\' against Iran.  Some of </p><p>      the chemical weapons he used were devices made </p><p>      from that material help he received. . .  It is </p><p>      a sad story of being used for other people\'s </p><p>      interests." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Under headline "Assault on Iraq stinks of `global </p><p>      evil\' the government-controlled weekly "The Sunday </p><p>      Mail" (09/22) carried the following opinion piece by </p><p>      Tafataona Mahoso: </p><p> </p><p>      "In a cynical retreat from the agenda and values </p><p>      of the Earth Summit in Johannesburg, the G-7 </p><p>      powers have gone back to their World Economic </p><p>      Forum in Germany and the Bush-Blair </p><p>      administrations have gone back to their efforts </p><p>      to hide their dismal failure in Afghanistan by </p><p>      claiming that the terrorism they went to </p><p>      eliminate in Afghanistan has suddenly </p><p>      transferred to Iraq. . .  Another war over oil </p><p>      in the Middle East will be so devastating to </p><p>      human life, marine life and weather that no kind </p><p>      of reparations would begin to redress the </p><p>      damage, even if they were offered.  The damage </p><p>      would be so colossal that no one would know </p><p>      where to start the restitution or </p><p>      reconstruction. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Under headline "When will sanity prevail?" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday News" (09/22) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "As Western hawks circle over Iraq, there is a </p><p>      growing worry that sole-superpower triumphalism </p><p>      will finally prevail over the civilized tenets </p><p>      of international law.  The bellicose cowboy from </p><p>      Texas and his faithful sidekick from London have </p><p>      pointed their guns at the people of Iraq, and no </p><p>      one, it seems, is able to stop them.  There are </p><p>      occasions in history when the use of force is </p><p>      both right and sensible.  Our conscience tells </p><p>      us that this is not one of them.  Make no </p><p>      mistake, American and British troops will invade </p><p>      Iraq before December.  Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair </p><p>      will neither give dialogue a chance nor ask the </p><p>      UN to send weapons inspectors to the Persian </p><p>      Gulf state.  But if Iraq really has weapons of </p><p>      mass destruction, why would the Bush Government </p><p>      risk diplomatic suicide by going it alone </p><p>      instead of presenting the evidence to the UN </p><p>      Security Council?." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
