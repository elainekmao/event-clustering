<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001814 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/PPC: CHARLOTTE ROE </p><p>USTR FOR VIONDETTE LOPEZ AND BUD CLATANOFF </p><p>USDOL FOR ILAB: ROBERT WHOLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ETRD, PGOV, PHUM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: CHOI SHIN/CIMATEXTILES LABOR AGREEMENT REACHED </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1313 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  After being threatened with withdrawal of </p><p>tax exemption privileges by the Ministry of Economy, </p><p>management of the Choi Shin/Cimatextiles maquila plants met </p><p>GOG requirements by successfully concluding and signing on </p><p>July 9 a collective bargaining agreement with each plant </p><p>union and achieving two other agreements with the union on </p><p>other pending labor complaints.  On July 10, the GOG </p><p>acknowledged these efforts and withdrew its threat to close </p><p>the plants for labor violations.  The resolution of the Choi </p><p>Shin/Cimatextiles case sets an important precedent in </p><p>Guatemala:  while other collective bargaining agreements have </p><p>been achieved in the sector, all resulted in the closure of </p><p>the plant and loss of unionized jobs.  This agreement is the </p><p>first result of the GOG\'s new forceful application of a </p><p>mechanism to compel respect for labor rights in the maquila </p><p>sector.  Thirty similar cases of factories with unresolved </p><p>labor complaints under GOG threat of closure remain.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Choi Shin/Cimatextiles plants share Korean </p><p>ownership and are co-located in the same complex in the Villa </p><p>Nueva municipality adjacent to the capital.  They employ a </p><p>total of 1300 workers.  Liz Claiborne Inc. is one of the </p><p>major buyers of clothing made in these factories.  Anti-union </p><p>violence, encouraged by management, broke out in July 2001 </p><p>when some workers filed a petition with the Labor Ministry </p><p>announcing a unionization drive.  After international </p><p>attention and GOG intervention, two plant unions (SITRACHOI </p><p>and SITRACIMA) were organized.  Since then, union members </p><p>reported a climate of low-level anti-union harassment which </p><p>prevented the unions from achieving the 25% threshold of </p><p>worker support to compel collective bargaining negotiations. </p><p>Meanwhile workers filed complaints with the Ministry of Labor </p><p>regarding unjustified firings (approximately 40 cases since </p><p>July 2001) and other issues. </p><p> </p><p>Minister\'s Role </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Minister of Labor Moreira told visiting USTR and </p><p>USDOL officials in May (RefTel) that President Portillo had </p><p>authorized the use of the Minister of Economy\'s power to </p><p>grant import and export tax privileges to compel resolution </p><p>of labor complaints pending against maquila employers.  At a </p><p>bilateral labor working group on July 10 (SepTel), Minister </p><p>Moreira told the Ambassador that the Labor Ministry has sent </p><p>a list of 30 maquilas with outstanding labor violations to </p><p>the Minister of Economy.  It chose Choi Shin/Cimatextiles as </p><p>the first case, not to threaten the existence of the only two </p><p>unions currently in existence in the maquila sector, he said, </p><p>but because it is the case that has generated the most </p><p>international attention.  If the GOG\'s three conditions were </p><p>met by July 10 (two had already been met by an earlier </p><p>deadline of July 7), he said, the GOG\'s threat to withdraw </p><p>tax privileges would be rescinded.  The outstanding </p><p>requirement was to present a signed collective bargaining </p><p>agreement. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Liz Claiborne\'s local representative and an agent </p><p>of the Fair Labor Association kept the Embassy informed of </p><p>the status of negotiations between Choi Shin/Cimatextiles\' </p><p>management and the unions throughout the negotiation and </p><p>played important roles encouraging an agreement.  Agreement </p><p>was reached on the final issue of a monthly wage raise (of </p><p>$12.85) on July 9.  The GOG acknowledged the agreement on </p><p>July 10. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Privately and publicly, industry employer groups </p><p>have reacted strongly against the use of the threat of </p><p>closure by the GOG to compel collective bargaining.  CACIF </p><p>Labor Commission chief Carlos Arias told LabAtt that </p><p>employers believe the GOG should close the plants for </p><p>violations rather than force them to negotiate a CBA "with a </p><p>gun to (management\'s) head."  VESTEX maquila employer </p><p>association labor advisor Rolando Figueroa accused the GOG of </p><p>"acting under political pressure" from international </p><p>organizations which "don\'t understand the economic realities </p><p>in Guatemala."  "(The GOG) should give appropriate attention </p><p>to labor violation complaints, but follow the course of the </p><p>law." </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) If implemented, the Choi Shin/Cimatextiles </p><p>collective bargaining agreement will be the first in the </p><p>Guatemalan maquila sector (previous agreements prompted </p><p>management to close their plants and reopen elsewhere to </p><p>break their unions).  As such, it will set a precedent not </p><p>lost on other maquila labor violators.  The GOG believes this </p><p>new coercive mechanism is legal and is an important new tool </p><p>to punish and prevent labor violations in plants which </p><p>benefit from export tax privileges.  While the GOG\'s strategy </p><p>in this case was high-risk (it might have resulted in the </p><p>closure of the only two unionized maquila plants in Guatemala </p><p>and the loss of 1300 jobs), the GOG deserves credit for </p><p>achieving an outcome which may strengthen labor rights and </p><p>cause violators to change their behavior. </p><p> </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
