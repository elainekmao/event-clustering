<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003992 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/ANE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, EAID, KPAL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PRM AMBASSADORS\' FUND REQUEST FOR PALESTINIAN </p><p>REFUGEES IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) 02 STATE 66319 </p><p>      B) POLASCHIK/LEVIN JUNE 23 TELCON </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR REQUESTS USD 20,000 UNDER THE PRM </p><p>AMBASSADORS\' FUND FOR REFUGEES IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO </p><p>BUILD A 177 SQUARE-METER ADDITION TO THE WOMEN\'S PROGRAM </p><p>CENTER AT JERASH REFUGEE CAMP.  THE ADDITION WILL ALLOW </p><p>THE CENTER TO ESTABLISH THREE INCOME-GENERATION PROJECTS </p><p>(WITH A PROJECTED INCOME OF USD 250 PER MONTH) AND EXPAND </p><p>ITS EXISTING DAYCARE PROGRAM TO SERVE AN ADDITIONAL 30 </p><p>CHILDREN.  THE INCOME-GENERATION PROJECTS WILL INCREASE </p><p>THE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THE WOMEN\'S CENTER AND </p><p>ENABLE IT TO EXPAND PROGRAMMING AND TRAINING </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES TO AN ADDITIONAL 35 WOMEN PER MONTH.  THE </p><p>PROJECT ALSO WILL FURTHER OVERALL USG REFUGEE GOALS OF </p><p>STRENGTHENING AND PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY.  WITH ONLY </p><p>NOMINAL UNRWA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUCH WOMEN\'S </p><p>PROGRAM CENTERS, THIS PROJECT RESPONDS TO A CRITICAL GAP </p><p>IN REFUGEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN JORDAN.  PER REF B, WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEADLINE FOR OUR SUBMISSION HAS BEEN </p><p>EXTENDED TO JULY 3.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE WOMEN\'S PROGRAM CENTER (WPC) IN JERASH REFUGEE </p><p>CAMP WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1989 WITH SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT </p><p>FROM UNRWA.  ALTHOUGH IT RECEIVES A MODEST SUBSIDY FROM </p><p>UNRWA (USD 6,000 PER YEAR), THIS INDEPENDENT, COMMUNITY- </p><p>BASED ORGANIZATION RELIES ON THE FEES CHARGED TO COURSE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS AND DAYCARE CLIENTS TO COVER ITS RUNNING </p><p>COSTS.  THE JERASH WPC DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES </p><p>TO COVER A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT.  THE CENTER PROVIDES </p><p>VOCATIONAL TRAINING (SEWING, COMPUTER AND HAIRDRESSING </p><p>COURSES), DAYCARE, FITNESS AND LEGAL AID PROGRAMS IN </p><p>ADDITION TO WOMEN\'S RIGHTS WORKSHOPS.  1,500 WOMEN </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE CENTER\'S PROGRAMMING EACH YEAR.   A </p><p>DYNAMIC AND WELL-ORGANIZED VOLUNTARY BOARD OF NINE WOMEN </p><p>GOVERNS THE CENTER, AND UNRWA PROVIDES TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CENTER.  MOST OF </p><p>JERASH CAMP\'S RESIDENTS ARE ORIGINALLY FROM GAZA AND </p><p>THEREFORE INELIGIBLE FOR JORDANIAN CITIZENSHIP, A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT SOCIO-ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PRM FUNDING IS REQUESTED TO CONSTRUCT A 177-SQUARE </p><p>METER ADDITION TO THE JERASH WPC.  THE ADDITIONAL SPACE </p><p>WILL ALLOW THE CENTER TO ESTABLISH THREE INCOME </p><p>GENERATION PROJECTS (COMMERCIAL SPACES THAT WILL BE </p><p>LEASED TO PRIVATE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE CAMP\'S FIRST </p><p>PRIVATE FEMALE PHYSICIAN) AND A 50-SQUARE METER ADDITION </p><p>TO ITS DAYCARE CENTER, ENABLING THE CENTER TO SERVE AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL 30 CHILDREN.  THE INCOME GENERATION PROJECTS </p><p>ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE USD 250 OF REVENUE FOR THE </p><p>CENTER, STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE AND </p><p>SUSTAINABILITY OF THE CENTER.  THE WPC WILL USE THE </p><p>ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO INCREASE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR </p><p>WOMEN, TO HOLD ADDITIONAL WORKSHOPS ON LEGAL AID AND </p><p>WOMEN\'S RIGHTS AND TO ORGANIZE NEW PROGRAMMING FOR THE </p><p>CAMP\'S YOUTH.  THE WOMEN\'S CENTER WILL CONTRIBUTE USD </p><p>1,400 OF ITS OWN FUNDS TOWARD THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS.  A </p><p>CONTRIBUTION OF USD 20,000 IS REQUESTED TO COVER THE </p><p>REMAINING CONSTRUCTION COSTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  JERASH CAMP\'S WPC WOULD IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT, </p><p>INCLUDING CONTRACTING AND SUPERVISION OF ALL CONSTRUCTION </p><p>SERVICES.  REFCOORD WOULD MONITOR THE PROJECT.  POST HAS </p><p>THE AUTHORITY AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO TRANSFER THESE </p><p>FUNDS TO THE INTENDED RECIPIENT AGENCY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  PER REF B, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEADLINE FOR OUR </p><p>SUBMISSION HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO JULY 3. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
