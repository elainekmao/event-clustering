<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RABAT 001086 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PGOV, KISL, MO </p><p>SUBJECT: CASABLANCA ATTACKS:  WHO ARE THE SALAFIYAH </p><p>JIHADIYAH? </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 RABAT 2234 </p><p>     B. 02 RABAT 2045 </p><p>     C. 02 RABAT 1167 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM HELEN LA LIME.  REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  COMMENTING ON THE MAY 16 BOMBINGS ON </p><p>MOROCCAN TELEVISION MAY 18, PM DRISS JETTOU INDIRECTLY </p><p>CRITICIZED THE LEGAL ISLAMIST JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY </p><p>(PJD), AS WELL AS THE LEFTIST MOROCCAN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ASSOCIATION (AMDH), FOR THEIR PAST CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OVER ALLEGED MISTREATMENT OF DETAINEES BELONGING </p><p>TO WHAT JETTOU CALLED "THE SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH MOVEMENT." </p><p>ALSO MAY 18, JUSTICE MINISTER MOHAMED BOUZOUBAA ASSOCIATED </p><p>THE MAY 16 BOMBINGS WITH THE GROUP "SIRAT AL MOUSTAQIM" (THE </p><p>RIGHT PATH).  SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH AND SIRAT AL MOUSTAQIM, </p><p>ALONG WITH "TAKFIR WAL HIJRA" (RENUNCIATION AND REPUDIATION), </p><p>ARE TERMS USED BY THE PRESS AND SOMETIMES THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>DESCRIBE VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE GROUPS, WHICH BURST ONTO THE </p><p>SCENE IN MOROCCO WITH A SERIES OF VIOLENT ACTS IN 2002 </p><p>LEADING TO A NUMBER OF ARRESTS (REFTELS).  WHILE MANY </p><p>MOROCCANS HAVE BEEN HORRIFIED BY THE NATURE OF THE CRIMES </p><p>ATTRIBUTED TO THESE GROUPS, AND THE PJD HAS REGULARLY ACCUSED </p><p>THE GOM OF MISTREATING DETAINEES IN THE NAME OF COUNTERING </p><p>THEM, CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HAS MAINTAINED THAT (1) SUCH GROUPS </p><p>HAD NO NATIONAL ORGANIZATION, LEADERSHIP, OR CHAIN OF </p><p>COMMAND, NO LINKS WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH FOREIGN </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, AND ESSENTIALLY CONSISTED OF DISORGANIZED, </p><p>RAGTAG BANDS, AND (2) THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD THE THREAT </p><p>WELL IN HAND.  THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE TO BE REVISED, IF </p><p>THE MAY 16 BOMBERS TURN OUT TO BE DRAWN FROM THIS FRINGE, AS </p><p>THE STATEMENTS BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>SEEM TO INDICATE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  IN TELEVISED COMMENTS MAY 18, PRIME MINISTER DRISS </p><p>JETTOU CRITICIZED, WITHOUT NAMING THEM, THOSE WHO, IN THE </p><p>NAME OF HUMAN RIGHTS, HAD CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS </p><p>HANDLING OF THE RECENT TRIALS OF MEMBERS OF THE "SALAFIYAH </p><p>JIHADIYAH MOVEMENT."  ALSO IN TELEVISED COMMENTS THE SAME </p><p>DAY, JUSTICE MINISTER MOHAMED BOUZOUBAA SAID THAT SOME OF THE </p><p>MAY 17 TERRORISTS WERE LINKED TO A GROUP CALLED "SIRAT AL </p><p>MOUSTAQIM" (THE RIGHT PATH).  THE PRECISE MEANINGS OF THE </p><p>TERMS "SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH" AND "SIRAT AL MOUSTAQIM" CAN BE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO DEVINE, AS THEY TEND TO BE USED INTERCHANGEABLY </p><p>IN THE MEDIA AND BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO REFER TO A </p><p>VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE, ON WHICH THE EMBASSY HAS PREVIOUSLY </p><p>REPORTED (SEE REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  FOR EXAMPLE, IN FEBRUARY 2002 IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD </p><p>OF CASABLANCA, A BAND OF RELIGIOUS FANATICS OPERATING UNDER </p><p>THE NAME "SIRAT AL MOUSTAQIM," LED BY SPIRITUAL LEADER </p><p>MILOUDI ZAKARIA, STONED TO DEATH A RESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT </p><p>WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY QUARRELED WITH A MEMBER OF THE BAND OVER </p><p>THE ISSUE OF ALCOHOL USE BY THE VICTIM.  ZAKARIA AND 13 </p><p>COMPANIONS WERE TRIED AND CONVICTED IN CASABLANCA FOR THE </p><p>MURDER.  IN MAY 2002 FEZ MOSQUE PREACHER MOHAMED ABDELWAHED </p><p>RAFIKI (ABU HAFS) WAS ARRESTED AND SENTENCED TO SIX MONTHS IN </p><p>PRISON (SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED TO THREE MONTHS) FOR, AMONG </p><p>OTHER INFRACTIONS, INCITING FOLLOWERS TO ATTACK INDIVIDUALS </p><p>PERCEIVED TO BE BEHAVING IN AN UN-ISLAMIC MANNER.  ABU HAFS </p><p>HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE PRESS AS A LEADER OF THE SALAFIYAH </p><p>JIHADIYAH. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  YOUSSEF FIKRI, DESCRIBED AS THE "EMIR" (RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADER) OF THE SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH, AND ALSO AS THE LEADER OF </p><p>THE MOVEMENT "TAKFIR WAL HIJRA" (RENUNCIATION AND </p><p>REPUDIATION), WAS ARRESTED IN JUNE 2002 ALONG WITH EIGHT </p><p>FOLLOWERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY TRIED FOR A SERIES OF BLOODTHIRSTY </p><p>CRIMES, COMMITTED IN VARIOUS CITIES IN MOROCCO, WHICH </p><p>INCLUDED KILLING VICTIMS AND DISMEMBERING THEM.  (THIS GROUP </p><p>BEGAN A HUNGER STRIKE WHILE IN PRISON IN MAY 2003.)  THE </p><p>COMMON THREAD UNITING MILOUDI\'S, HAFS\', AND FIKRI\'S GROUPS IS </p><p>VIGILANTE ACTION AGAINST INDIVIDUALS PERCEIVED TO BE ENGAGING </p><p>IN UN-ISLAMIC BEHAVIOUR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  MOST MOROCCANS WERE SHOCKED, NOT ONLY BY THE DETAILS </p><p>OF THESE CRIMES LAST YEAR, BUT ALSO BY THE VERY EXISTENCE OF </p><p>SUCH GROUPS IN THE MOROCCAN BODY POLITIC, HERETOFORE </p><p>UNSUSPECTED.  (AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS HAFS\' ARREST IN MAY </p><p>2002, THE EXISTENCE OF THE AL QAIDA CELL THAT PLANNED ATTACKS </p><p>ON U.S. SHIPPING IN THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR WAS REVEALED.) </p><p>INEVITABLE COMPARISONS WITH ALGERIA CAME UP.  AMONG </p><p>TRADITIONAL ISLAMISTS, HOWEVER, AND PARTICULARLY THE LEGAL </p><p>JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY (PJD), THERE WAS A TENDENCY TO </p><p>SEE THE ARRESTS AND THE NEWS REPORTS AS A PLOT FABRICATED BY </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TO DISCREDIT ALL ISLAMISTS IN THE RUN-UP TO </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2002 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE </p><p>PJD, JOINED BY THE FAR LEFT, AS REPRESENTED BY THE MOROCCAN </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ASSOCIATION (AMDH), KEPT UP A STEADY DRUMBEAT OF </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE GOM FOR ALLEGED MISTREATMENT OF DETAINEES </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH THE VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE.  IT WAS THESE </p><p>CRITICISMS THAT PM JETTOU REFERRED TO IN HIS COMMENTS OF MAY </p><p>18. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  WHILE SOME MOROCCANS WERE ALARMED BY THE EMERGENCE </p><p>IN MOROCCO OF THE VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE AND OTHERS THOUGHT </p><p>THE WHOLE PHENOMENON A GOM FABRICATION, THERE HAS BEEN UNTIL </p><p>NOW A GENERAL CONSENSUS AROUND TWO MAIN POINTS.  THE FIRST </p><p>WAS THAT THERE WAS NO COHERENT NATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO WHICH </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE FRINGE BELONGED, AND NO OVERALL LEADER OR </p><p>CHAIN OF COMMAND.  THE THINKING WENT THAT THE THREAT, SUCH AS </p><p>IT WAS, WAS POSED BY A FEW RAGTAG BANDS, WITH NO LINKS TO </p><p>EACH OTHER OR TO FOREIGN ORGANIZATIONS.  THE SECOND PIECE OF </p><p>CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WAS THAT THE GOM, AND SPECIFICALLY THE </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTRY, HAD THE GROUPS WELL IN HAND AND UNDER </p><p>CONTROL.  BOTH ASSUMPTIONS WILL NOW HAVE TO BE REVISED, IF </p><p>THE MAY 16 BOMBERS INDEED PROVE TO BE DRAWN FROM THESE </p><p>VIOLENT GROUPS.  WHILE THERE IS MUCH THAT REMAINS TO BE </p><p>REVEALED BY THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER WOULD PUBLICLY </p><p>ASSOCIATE THE SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH AND THE SIRAT EL MOUSTAQIM </p><p>WITH MAY 16 UNLESS THERE WERE EVIDENCE POINTING IN THAT </p><p>DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  MANY ON THE LEFT, WITH SEPTEMBER 2003 MUNICIPAL </p><p>COUNCIL ELECTIONS IN MIND, WILL ATTEMPT TO TAR THE PJD WITH </p><p>THE MAY 16 BRUSH.  IF THE PERPETRATORS ARE ULTIMATELY PROVEN </p><p>TO BE MEMBERS OF THE VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE, THE PJD WILL </p><p>HAVE SOME BACKFILLING TO DO.  WE WILL EXAMINE IN SUBSEQUENT </p><p>REPORTING REACTIONS TO MAY 16 BY THE PJD AS WELL AS BY THE </p><p>JUSTICE AND CHARITY ORGANIZATION (JCO), MOROCCO,S OTHER </p><p>PRINCIPAL (AND SEMI-LEGAL) ISLAMIST ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TUTWILER </p><p></p></div>
