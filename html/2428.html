<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000269 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/29/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE PROMISES FREE AND FAIR ELECTION, NAMES OBSERVER </p><p>GROUPS TO BE INVITED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) APPEARING BEFORE JOURNALISTS ON JANUARY 28, PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE PROMISED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD DO ALL IT COULD TO ENSURE </p><p>A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION, AND ANNOUNCED THAT INVITATIONS WOULD BE </p><p>EXTENDED TO OBSERVER DELEGATIONS FROM THE FOLLOWING:  THE OAU; </p><p>SADC; COMESA; ECOWAS; THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT; THE COMMONWEALTH </p><p>(EXCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM); A JOINT AFRICAN, CARIBBEAN, PACIFIC </p><p>(ACP)-EU DELEGATION LED BY THE ACP (EXCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM); </p><p>THE NAACP; AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND COUNTRIES TO BE INVITED "IN </p><p>DUE COURSE," INCLUDING NIGERIA.  HE SAID NIGERIA AND SADC COULD </p><p>SEND OBSERVERS "IMMEDIATELY" BUT DID NOT SPECIFY WHEN INVITATIONS </p><p>MIGHT BE FORTHCOMING FOR THE OTHER DESIGNATED GROUPS.   MUGABE ALSO </p><p>APPEALED TO POLITICAL PARTIES, CHURCHES, WAR VETERANS, TRADE </p><p>UNIONS, AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO END INCIDENTS OF POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>MARCH 9-10.   HE ANNOUNCED THAT ZIMBABWEAN EMBASSIES ABROAD WOULD </p><p>ACCREDIT FOREIGN JOURNALISTS TO COVER THE ELECTION, BUT PROVIDED NO </p><p>DETAILS ON WHEN THAT PROCESS WOULD BEGIN OR HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: MOST OF THE GROUPS MUGABE NAMED HAVE LITTLE OR NO </p><p>CAPACITY FOR OR EXPERIENCE IN ELECTION OBSERVATION, A FACT OF WHICH </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT IS LIKELY WELL AWARE.  SEVERAL EU </p><p>DIPLOMATS TOLD US MUGABE PROBABLY EXPECTS THE EU TO REJECT THE </p><p>CONDITIONS PLACED ON ITS PARTICIPATION.  ACCORDING TO ALEX KREMER, </p><p>A HARARE-BASED EU DIPLOMAT, THE ACP HAS A TINY SECRETARIAT IN </p><p>BRUSSELS AND NO EXPERIENCE IN OBSERVING ELECTIONS, AND VALUABLE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00269  01 OF 02  291601Z </p><p>TIME WOULD NOW BE CONSUMED BY ACP-EU CONSULTATIONS ON HOW TO </p><p>PROCEED.  MUGABE DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH SADC INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE </p><p>INVITED, BUT THE SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM\'S SECRETARY-GENERAL TOLD </p><p>US THAT BOTH THE FORUM AND THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN MINISTERS WOULD </p><p>BE INCLUDED. INTERLOCUTORS FROM THE CANADIAN AND AUSTRALIAN HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONS TOLD US THAT IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST A WEEK FROM THE </p><p>DATE OF RECEIPT OF A GOZ INVITATION FOR THE COMMONWEALTH TO DEPLOY </p><p>AN OBSERVER TEAM, AND POINTED OUT THAT MUGABE HAD NOT BEEN EXPLICIT </p><p>ABOUT WHEN SUCH AN INVITATION MIGHT BE ISSUED.  MUGABE DID NOT </p><p>MENTION IFES OR THE CARTER CENTER, AND WE ARE NOT AWARE THAT THE </p><p>NAACP HAS ANY CAPACITY FOR OR INTEREST IN OBSERVING THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>ELECTION.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE LIST ANNOUNCED BY MUGABE WAS </p><p>CONCOCTED IN ORDER TO BUY TIME AND TO ENSURE AS LITTLE SCRUTINY AS </p><p>POSSIBLE, WHILE TRYING TO MAKE THE GOZ APPEAR FORTHCOMING. </p><p>MUGABE\'S CALL FOR A REDUCTION IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND VOW TO DO </p><p>EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENSURE A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION ARE </p><p>CERTAINLY POSITIVE MESSAGES, BUT ONLY DEVELOPMENTS ON THE GROUND </p><p>WILL SHOW WHETHER HE IS SINCERE.  WE ARE NOT OPTIMISTIC. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  BEGIN TEXT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S JANUARY 28 REMARKS: </p><p> </p><p>SINCE MY ANNOUNCEMENT ON 9 JANUARY THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>WOULD BE HELD ON THE 9TH AND 10TH OF MARCH 2002, MY GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS, AND SET ON COURSE VARIOUS PROCESSES TO </p><p>FACILITATE THE HOLDING OF A SMOOTH POLITICAL PROCESS.  I WISH TO </p><p>EXPRESS MY SATISFACTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S PREPARATIONS SO FAR </p><p>FOR THE ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>THE FORTHCOMING ELECTION WILL, ONCE AGAIN, UNDERLINE ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ESTABLISHED DEMOCRATIC TRADITION SINCE ITS INDEPENDENCE IN 1980, OF </p><p>HOLDING REGULAR PARLIAMENTARY AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00269  01 OF 02  291601Z </p><p>PROVIDED FOR IN OUR CONSTITUTION.
