SUMMARY:  GEN. JAY GARNER\'S ARRIVAL IN BAGHDAD TO BEGIN THE </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ, THE STRUGGLE TO FORM A NEW PALESTINIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND THE CIVILAIN CASUALTIES IN PALESTINE DOMINATED </p><p>COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL CRITICIZED THE </p><p>"WAR" BETWEEN PRESIDENT ARAFAT AND ABU MAZEN OVER THE FORMATION </p><p>OF A NEW PALSTINIAN GOVERNMENT.  UAE COLUMINST DR. SHAMLAN AL </p><p>EISSA DESCRIBED IN "AL ITTIHAD" WHAT HE CONSIDERS THE REAL REASON </p><p>BEHIND ARAB GOVERNMENTS\' CONCERN FOR THE SITUATION IN IRAQ:  THE </p><p>SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY TO THEIR COUNTRIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON THE FORMATION OF A NEW PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT, </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 4/22: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE WAR OF POSITIONS, NAMES, DIPLOMATIC POUCHES, AND </p><p>AUTHORITIES GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE FORMATION OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE STOPPED, SO ISRAEL, ALONG WITH </p><p>THE U.S., WILL NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND SOW FURTHER DIVISIONS </p><p>AMONG THE PALESTINIANS, EITHER WITHIN THE AUTHORITY ITSELF, OR </p><p>BETWEEN THE AUTHORITY AND OTHER POWERS ... WHAT PALESTINE NEEDS </p><p>NOW IN PARTICULAR IS TO STRUGGLE AND EXERT THE EFFORTS OF ALL </p><p>POWERS IN ORDER TO END THE OCCUPATION, IT (PALESTINE) DOES NOT </p><p>NEED FIGHTING IN ORDER TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM (ISRAEL) OR TO </p><p>SATISFY THEM." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON A LOS ANGELES TIME REPORT ON THE AMERICAN </p><p>STRATEGY TO QUIET ANTI-AMERICANISM IN THE REGION, DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 4/22: </p><p> </p><p>"... AS ADVERTISED THROUGH ITS MEDIA AND PRESS, THIS IS WHAT THE </p><p>U.S. WANTS.  THIS CONFIRMS A CLEAR REALITY THAT THE U.S. IS </p><p>SEEKING TO IMPOSE ITS MANDATE ON THE ARABS ON ONE HAND AND FOR </p><p>THE BENEFIT OF THE ISRAELI ZIONISTS ON THE OTHER.  WE CANNOT </p><p>DISREGARD THE \'BITTER\' REALITY THAT THE \'SECOND WINNER\' IN THIS </p><p>WAR AGAINST IRAQ WAS THE ZIONISTS ... THE U.S. INTENTION IS </p><p>DEFINITELY NOT TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR THE ARABS ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "ANOTHER VEILED THREAT," EXPATRIATE- </p><p>ORIENTED, ENGLISH DAILY GULF NEWS EDITORIALIZED 4/22: </p><p> </p><p>"AFTER THE SWIFT INVASION OF IRAQ, IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR THAT </p><p>OCCUPATION WAS THE NAME OF THE GAME, NOT LIBERATION, NOR FREEDOM, </p><p>SINCE NO STRATEGY HAS BEEN DEVISED TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE WERE </p><p>SUPPLIED WITH THE BASIC NECESSITIES OF LIFE.  ONLY NOW, SOME FOUR </p><p>WEEKS AFTER THE INVASION, ARE RUSHED EFFORTS BEING MADE TO REMEDY </p><p>THE SITUATION.  BUT WHAT WAS PROTECTED AND GUARDED, WERE THE OIL </p><p>WELLS AND EVEN THE MINISTRY OF OIL BUILDING IN BAGHDAD.  THAT </p><p>THOSE SAME TROOPS STOOD IDLY BY WHILE LOOTING WENT ON, SEEMED NOT </p><p>TO MATTER TO THE INVADERS.  THAT THE PRICELESS HERITAGE OF 5,000 </p><p>YEARS OF CIVILIZATION WAS BLATANTLY STOLEN WAS IGNORED, MORE </p><p>IMPORTANT WAS TO SECURE PROFITABLE REBUILDING CONTRACTS FOR THE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE CAUCAS CRONIES." </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN A CLOSING STATEMENT, SALEM WROTE IN "AL-KHALEEJ" ON 4/21: </p><p> </p><p>"THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS STARTED AWARDING RE-BUILDING </p><p>CONTRACTS, IN ORDER TO REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF IRAQ </p><p>DESTROYED BY THE INVADERS.  AS EXPECTED, THE LION\'S SHARE GOES TO </p><p>AMERICAN COMPANIES, WHICH HAVE DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE U.S. </p><p>ADMINISTRATION ITSELF.  THIS MEANS THAT THE AMERICAN LOOTING OF </p><p>IRAQ STARTED EARLY, AND THIS ILLEGAL OCCUPATION IS DISTRIBUTING </p><p>ILLEGAL CONTRACTS TO ILLEGAL COMPANIES.  THIS IS ONLY THE </p><p>BEGINNING.  OR, THIS IS THE TITLE OF THE OCCUPATION AND </p><p>REPRESENTS ITS MEANING ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "LIBERATION NOT OCCUPATION," UAE COLUMNIST </p><p>DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA WROTE IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" ON 4/20: </p><p> </p><p>"WE ARE SURE THAT THE ARAB AND GULF GOVERNMENTS ASKING THE </p><p>OCCUPIERS TO LEAVE IRAQ, AND LEAVE IRAQ FOR ITS PEOPLE TO RULE, </p><p>DO NOT REALLY CARE ABOUT THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  THESE GOVERNMENTS </p><p>DREAD THE FACT THAT THE COALITION COUNTRIES MIGHT CHANGE THOUGHTS </p><p>AND MINDS NOT ONLY IN IRAQ, BUT ALSO IN THE NEIGHBOURING ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THEY DREAD REAL DEMOCRACY ..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
