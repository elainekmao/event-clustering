<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000753 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, AJ, GG, KZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: BTC UPDATE FROM TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 528 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by EconCouns Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  BTC construction in Turkey is on schedule </p><p>(first pipe is scheduled to arrive at Iskenderun port on </p><p>February 7) and on budget; however, there is some concern </p><p>that the change in government has slowed down the </p><p>decision-making process on operational issues.  We believe </p><p>that occasional delays are to be expected in a project of </p><p>this size; however, we will meet with GOT officials in the </p><p>next several days to reiterate the importance of operational </p><p>continuity for BTC.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Although BTC construction in Turkey is on schedule and </p><p>on budget, BOTAS General Manager Bildaci and Turkey-based BTC </p><p>Co executives are concerned that the change in government has </p><p>slowed down the decision-making process on operational </p><p>issues.  Bildaci and BTC Co officials complained to econoff </p><p>that BOTAS employees and board members are "paralyzed" as </p><p>they wait for the outcome of rumored personnel changes and </p><p>new investigations into past contract awards.  For example, </p><p>Bildaci claimed that the board has delayed voting on hiring </p><p>additional personnel to handle the logistics of land </p><p>acquisition, and BOTAS employees are neglecting important </p><p>BTC-related issues as they investigate claims by the new </p><p>government that BTC Co salaries are too high. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AK Party officials -- from Tayyip Erdogan to Energy </p><p>Minister Guler -- have emphasized their support for the BTC </p><p>project (reftel).  At the same time, however, the new </p><p>government has reportedly taken steps that have caused some </p><p>jitters at the Ministry of Energy (MENR) and BOTAS.  For </p><p>example, the government reportedly wants to investigate all </p><p>past tenders and contract awards made by BOTAS.  A recent </p><p>television news report stated that Energy Minister Guler had </p><p>sent to the President\'s office for approval a decree </p><p>dismissing the top 50 energy bureaucrats, including the </p><p>Energy Undersecretary and Deputy Undersecretaries, as well as </p><p>the Director General and Deputy Director General of BOTAS, </p><p>TPAO, and other state-owned energy companies.  (Note: </p><p>Neither our MFA or MENR contacts can confirm the existence of </p><p>this decree or who is on it.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On the positive side, the first pipe for the Turkish </p><p>segment of BTC is scheduled to arrive at Iskenderun port on </p><p>February 7.  For now, BOTAS is planning to receive all pipe </p><p>at Iskenderun; however, it has designated other "contingency" </p><p>ports in the event that regional developments close the </p><p>Iskenderun option. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Local BP executives told econoff that, as of February </p><p>1, BP will increase the risk level for Turkey from "medium" </p><p>to "high."  The next risk level of "very high" could result </p><p>in the evacuation of BP expats from Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  As noted, BTC construction in Turkey is on </p><p>track; we believe that current operational delays --although </p><p>not to be ignored -- are one of the to-be-expected hiccups in </p><p>a project of this size.  We will meet with MFA Deputy U/S </p><p>Kilic and Ministry of Energy U/S Yigitguden in the next </p><p>several days to reiterate the importance of operational </p><p>continuity for BTC.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
