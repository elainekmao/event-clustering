<p>UNCLAS ROME 006062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT, EUR, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT:  FINI AND FRATTINI ON THE EU CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  ITALIAN DEPUTY PM AND GOI REPRESENTATIVE TO </p><p>THE EU CONVENTION GIANFRANCO FINI AND FM FRANCO FRATTINI </p><p>TOLD PARLIAMENT THAT POSITIONS WITHIN THE EU CONVENTION ARE </p><p>STILL DISTANT AND THE CONVENTION WILL PROBABLY TRANSMIT </p><p>"DIVERGENT" PROPOSALS TO THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE </p><p>(IGC).  THEY STRESSED ITALY\'S WISH TO SIGN A NEW EU TREATY </p><p>DURING ITS PRESIDENCY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06062  210009Z </p><p>REMARKED THAT ITALY\'S APPROACH IN THE IGC WILL BE "OPEN AND </p><p>FLEXIBLE."  FINI PROPOSED INSERTING A CLAUSE ON RELIGION IN </p><p>THE FUTURE EU TREATY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DEPUTY PM FINI AND FM FRATTINI APPEARED BEFORE A JOINT </p><p>SESSION OF THE SENATE AND CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS COMMITTEES DECEMBER 17 TO TALK ABOUT PROGRESS ON </p><p>THE EU CONVENTION.  FINI ARGUED AT LENGTH ON THE NEED FOR A </p><p>"CONSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE" FOR EUROPE AND OF ITS </p><p>IMPORTANCE WHEN THE EU ENLARGES TO 25 COUNTRIES.  HE SAID, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT POSITIONS WITHIN THE CONVENTION ARE STILL </p><p>DISTANT AND THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THE </p><p>CHAPTER ON INSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN THE CONVENTION\'S DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL TREATY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THIS NOTWITHSTANDING, FINI SAID THE EU-15 AGREE THAT AN </p><p>ENLARGED EU CAN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION BY KEEPING ITS CURRENT </p><p>BALANCE OF POWERS, THAT IS, THE CURRENT "INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>TRIANGLE" BETWEEN THE EU COUNCIL, THE EU COMMISSION, AND </p><p>THE EU PARLIAMENT.  HE ARGUED THAT REFORM MUST CONTINUE </p><p>WHILE PRESERVING THE CURRENT "BALANCE AMONG FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>POWERS."  EUROPEAN PUBLIC OPINION, HE SAID, WANTS THE EU TO </p><p>BE "SIMPLE, TRANSPARENT, AND EFFECTIVE." </p><p> </p><p>4.  FINI DID NOT OFFER MUCH DETAIL ON THE STATE OF PROGRESS </p><p>IN THE CONVENTION.  HE DID SAY THAT IN A 25-MEMBER EUROPE, </p><p>THE CURRENT SIX-MONTH ROTATIONAL PRESIDENCY WILL NOT WORK </p><p>AND THAT THE PREVAILING FEELING WITHIN THE CONVENTION IS TO </p><p>ADOPT A ROTATIONAL PRESIDENCY OF "AT LEAST" TWO YEARS. </p><p>THIS COULD BE COUNTER-BALANCED BY GIVING THE EUROPEAN </p><p>PARLIAMENT A STRONGER ROLE: THE EU COUNCIL COULD NOMINATE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06062  210009Z </p><p>THE EU ROTATIONAL PRESIDENT AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT </p><p>COULD "RATIFY AND SUPPORT" THAT DECISION BY MAJORITY VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FINI SAID THERE IS A "WIDE AND SATISFACTORY" </p><p>CONVERGENCE OF POSITIONS ON SEVERAL POINTS, MANY OF WHICH </p><p>HAVE THE GOI\'S SUPPORT.  AGAIN, HE DID NOT OFFER MUCH </p><p>INFORMATION, LIMITING HIMSELF TO SAYING THESE POINTS </p><p>INCLUDE INVESTING THE EU WITH "FULL LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY" </p><p>AND ADOPTING THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY IN DISTRIBUTING </p><p>POWERS AND AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ON SUBSIDIARITY, FINI NOTED THAT THE EU WILL PROBABLY </p><p>WANT TO GIVE NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS A "STRONG ROLE OF </p><p>VERIFICATION," INCLUDING THE POWER TO APPEAL TO THE </p><p>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IF THEY DETECT VIOLATIONS.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT THERE IS "UNANIMOUS CONVERGENCE" AT THE </p><p>CONVENTION ON NOT WEIGHING DOWN THE FUTURE EU CONSTITUTION </p><p>WITH A "RIGID LIST OF POWERS," BUT MAKING IT INSTEAD </p><p>"FLEXIBLE." </p><p> </p><p>7.  ON RELIGION, HE SAID A POSSIBILITY WOULD BE TO INCLUDE </p><p>IN ARTICLE 34 ON THE PRINCIPLES OF PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY </p><p>A SUB-ARTICLE REGARDING STRUCTURED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE EU </p><p>AND CHURCHES (UNION OF CHURCHES), LEAVING EACH MEMBER STATE </p><p>FREE TO DEVELOP THE ISSUE AS IT DEEMS IT BEST FOR ITS OWN </p><p>COUNTRY.  DEBATE ON THIS POINT WAS STRONGER OUTSIDE THE </p><p>CONVENTION THAN DURING ITS SESSIONS, HE COMMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  FINI REMARKED THAT THE CONVENTION WILL INEVITABLY </p><p>TRANSMIT TO THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE (IGC) A </p><p>SERIES OF "DIVERGENT" OPTIONS.  HE AND FRATTINI STRESSED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06062  210009Z </p><p>THAT ITALY WILL REMAIN "OPEN AND FLEXIBLE."  THEY SAID IT </p><p>WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT (IT IS ITS "RIGHT" AND ITS "DUTY," </p><p>FINI SAID) TO HOLD -- AND CONCLUDE -- THE IGC DURING ITS EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY JULY-DECEMBER 2003, IN ORDER TO SIGN THE NEW EU </p><p>TREATY IN ROME.  IT IS A QUESTION OF "PRESTIGE" FOR ITALY - </p><p>- THE TREATY CREATING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY WAS </p><p>SIGNED IN ROME IN 1957; THE TREATY CREATING THE NEW EUROPE </p><p>OF 25 MUST BE SIGNED IN ROME IN 2003.  THE NEW EUROPE WILL </p><p>THEN BE READY TO FUNCTION WITH ITS TEN NEW MEMBERS THAT </p><p>WILL JOIN IT IN MAY 2004 AND BEFORE THE EUROPEAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN THE SUMMER OF 2004. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN CONCLUSION, AFTER THANKING EU CONVENTION VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT GIULIANO AMATO FOR HIS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AND </p><p>"VERY VALUABLE" WORK, FINI AND FRATTINI SAID THEY WILL </p><p>RETURN TO PARLIAMENT OFTEN TO KEEP IT INFORMED OF THE </p><p>CONVENTION\'S PROGRESS AND TO SEEK ITS SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT\'S POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME06062 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
