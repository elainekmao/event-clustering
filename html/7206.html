<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000433 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS AID/ANE </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP DAS DALEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, SOCI, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW FUNDING INITIATIVE: WHY NOT KEEP AN OPEN MIND? </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 81067 </p><p>     B. TOKYO 1194 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph seven. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary: The language of the recent FY 2003-04 omnibus </p><p>spending measure\'s managers\' report (asking us to work with </p><p>the NLD on a "new initiative" to outline a comprehensive </p><p>needs assessment) seems at odds with subsequent guidance (Ref </p><p>A) limiting this assessment only to democracy-related </p><p>programming.  We ask that the Department revisit this issue </p><p>with the Hill to see if there is support for a slightly less </p><p>restrictive approach that would still address the primary </p><p>concern that USG assistance does not in any way benefit the </p><p>SPDC regime.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We appreciate Ref A\'s elaboration on the language in </p><p>the FY 2003-04 omnibus spending measure\'s managers\' report </p><p>regarding working with the NLD to identify and address the </p><p>"urgent needs" of the Burmese people.  We were surprised, </p><p>though, by the expectation that traditional limitations on </p><p>general ESF funding would apply to this "new initiative." </p><p>The managers\' report discusses other earmark-funded programs, </p><p>namely for fighting HIV/AIDS, that are not limited to </p><p>democracy promotion.  We welcomed what we thought was indeed </p><p>a "new initiative" along these lines; to look -- as always in </p><p>tandem with the NLD and its leadership -- with an unbiased, </p><p>unjaded eye at what the most pressing priorities are. </p><p>Consulting with the NLD on the best way for the USG to </p><p>promote democracy in Burma does not constitute a "new </p><p>initiative."  This has been the backbone of our work here for </p><p>many years. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The managers\' report asks us to use the "expertise of </p><p>the leadership" of the NLD to determine and address the </p><p>"urgent needs of the people of Burma."  Nowhere does it imply </p><p>that the intent of the managers was to limit these findings </p><p>to new democracy programming.  Indeed, from elsewhere in the </p><p>managers\' report (such as the section requesting a report </p><p>from U.S. AID on the conditions of Burmese refugees and </p><p>displaced persons) it is evident that Congress this year is </p><p>interested in exploring the "root causes" of the crises </p><p>facing the people of Burma.  This is a laudable objective. </p><p>Though lack of freedom and deplorable human rights are a </p><p>fundamental reason for the suffering of all Burmese people </p><p>(displaced or not), the more immediate causes of the </p><p>humanitarian crisis facing the Burmese people are horrendous </p><p>health, sanitation, and educational deficiencies.  These are </p><p>the issues that other bilateral donors are now addressing, in </p><p>some cases quite independently of the SPDC. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Limiting before the fact any discussion to democracy </p><p>promotion programs seems to go against the managers\' intent. </p><p>It also ignores the NLD leadership\'s previously expressed </p><p>ideas that "urgent needs of the people of Burma" go well </p><p>beyond such programs.  The NLD leadership has welcomed U.S. </p><p>support for HIV/AIDS, childhood development programs, </p><p>environmental conservation, and protection of workers rights </p><p>inside the country.  While none of these fits directly within </p><p>the limited definition of democracy and governance programs, </p><p>there\'s no question that all would reside on the list sought </p><p>by Congress of "urgent needs." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A third argument for allowing more slack in the reins </p><p>is that by giving the NLD and its leadership more flexibility </p><p>to guide USG assistance efforts, the party will gain status </p><p>and credibility with the SPDC, hopefully convincing it of the </p><p>NLD\'s important and indispensable role in the future of the </p><p>country.  As reported in Ref B, at the most recent ICG </p><p>meeting in Tokyo, U.N. Special Envoy Razali urged donors to </p><p>work closely with the NLD while developing aid programs </p><p>specifically as a way to build up ASSK and the NLD and </p><p>perhaps get the dialogue jump started.  From the local angle, </p><p>U.S. assistance to NLD-promoted humanitarian projects will </p><p>help cement the role of the NLD as a party truly interested </p><p>in and dedicated to the "needs of the people." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Action request:  We urge the Department to return to </p><p>the Hill to revisit this matter with all/all authors of the </p><p>report language, to decide whether it\'s truly in USG </p><p>interests to put the democracy promotion limitation on the </p><p>consultative process before we\'ve heard what the NLD has to </p><p>say.  We propose instead to approach the NLD and its </p><p>leadership with the broader aim of identifying programs that </p><p>address the urgent needs of the people (as requested by the </p><p>report language) and also scrupulously avoid "providing </p><p>direct support to the SPDC" and its affiliated organizations. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
