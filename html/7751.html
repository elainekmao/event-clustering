<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001833 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD, J5 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MARR, IT, IZ, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY ROLLING OUT FIELD HOSPITAL TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 1754 </p><p>     B. ROME 1618 </p><p>     C. ROME 1731 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL-MINISTER COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  EMBASSY ROME WANTS TO EXPRESS ITS APPRECIATION TO </p><p>ALL THOSE IN THE FIELD-- ESPECIALLY AT CENTCOM--WHO ARE </p><p>ASSISTING THE GOI DEPLOY ITS RED CROSS HOSPITAL TO IRAQ.  WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND ALL TOO WELL THAT UNTIL APRIL 24 THE TWO-WAY </p><p>COMMUNICATION FLOW IN TAMPA DID NOT WORK AS IT SHOULD HAVE, </p><p>BUT ARE PLEASED THAT THE DEPLOYMENT IS NOW IN TRAIN. </p><p>SENSITIVITY TO OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LINKAGE BETWEEN GIVING </p><p>THE GREEN LIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL AND THE GOI\'S ABILITY TO PUSH </p><p>FORWARD ITS PHASE IV CONTRIBUTIONS WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED </p><p>HERE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF THE 100-BED </p><p>HOSPITAL (REF A)--INCLUDING FIRST AID AND SURGERY </p><p>UNITS--ARRIVED IN KUWAIT CITY ON APRIL 29 AND WILL EVENTUALLY </p><p>BE TRANSPORTED OVERLAND TO BAGHDAD.  THE HOSPITAL, WHICH WILL </p><p>BE ABLE TO HANDLE AN ADDITIONAL 400 OUTPATIENT VISITORS </p><p>DAILY, WILL BE SUPPORTED INITIALLY BY FIFTEEN MEDICAL </p><p>PERSONNEL AND FIFTEEN CARABINIERI TO PROVIDE SECURITY.  WE </p><p>EXPECT ANOTHER FIFTEEN CARBS TO FOLLOW ONCE THE FACILITY IS </p><p>FULLY OPERATIONAL.  THE BULK OF THE HOSPITAL WILL BE </p><p>TRANSPORTED VIA SEA WITH A SHIP SCHEDULED TO DEPART THE PORT </p><p>OF LA SPEZIA ON MAY 3 AND ARRIVE IN AQABA, JORDAN ON OR ABOUT </p><p>MAY 9.  THE GOI PLANS TO TRANSPORT THESE ELEMENTS FROM AQABA </p><p>    TO BAGHDAD OVERLAND. COUNSELOR GIAN LUDOVICO DE MARTINO </p><p>OPENED AN ITALY INTERESTS SECTION IN BAGHDAD ON APRIL 24, </p><p>PAVING THE WAY FOR THE APRIL 27 ARRIVAL OF THE FULL-TIME </p><p>ORHA-LIAISON, ANTONIO ARMELLINI, WHO HAS ALREADY MET WITH </p><p>GEN. GARNER.  NEVERTHELESS, WE WILL URGE THE GOI TO KEEP UP </p><p>THE GOOD WORK THROUGH THE LNO (GEN. SANTINI) TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>ALL THE OPERATIONAL DETAILS OF MOVING THE FACILITY\'S PIECES </p><p>FALL INTO PLACE.  ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT, FINALLY, THEY </p><p>WILL DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) WE NOTED IN REF B THAT SITING A FIELD HOSPITAL IN </p><p>BETWEEN THE AL NOUMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL AND THE KHEDIMIA </p><p>PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL (NEAR SADDAM CITY) OPENS THE WAY FOR ITALY </p><p>TO REESTABLISH A LONG-TERM "SPONSORING" RELATIONSHIP WITH THE </p><p>TWO PERMANENT FACILITIES.   FM FRATTINI HAS NOW SIGNED AN </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH ITALY\'S RED CROSS COMMISSIONER THAT COMMITS </p><p>THE GOI TO WORK TOWARDS A RAPID RETURN TO FULL FUNCTIONALITY </p><p>OF THE TWO HOSPITALS.  THIS INCLUDES DISTRIBUTING MEDICINE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSIONER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) OUR UK CONTACTS REPORT THAT THEIR PHASE IV </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ITALIAN MILITARY STAFF ARE GOING WELL. </p><p>ITALY IS COMMITTED TO STANDING UP A FORCE OF UP TO 2000 ARMY </p><p>TROOPS PLUS 400-500 CARABINIERI IN THE BRITISH SECTOR.  THE </p><p>DEPLOYMENT PROBABLY WILL NOT TAKE PLACE BEFORE LATE JUNE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE BRITS, WITH THE EXACT LOCATION STILL TO BE </p><p>DETERMINED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) UNDERSECRETARY TO THE PM GIANNI LETTA REPORTEDLY TOLD </p><p>DEPARTING UK AMBASSADOR SHEPERD THAT NO FURTHER AUTHORIZATION </p><p>FOR THE DEPLOYMENT WOULD BE REQUIRED.  LETTA HAD SENT A </p><p>    LETTER TO THE PRESIDENTS OF THE HOUSE OF DEPUTIES AND THE </p><p>SENATE NOTIFYING THEM OF THE INITIAL CARABINIERI DETACHMENT </p><p>SLATED TO PROVIDE FORCE PROTECTION FOR THE FIELD HOSPITAL. </p><p>HE RECEIVED AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FROM THE TWO PRESIDENTS </p><p>INDICATING THAT THE PARLIAMENT HAD GRANTED ALL NECESSARY </p><p>AUTHORIZATION FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF MILITARY PERSONNEL "TO </p><p>HELP CREATE CONDITIONS FOR HUMANITARIAN AID" WHEN IT APPROVED </p><p>THE GOI\'S MOTION ON APRIL 15 (REF C). PER REF C, THE GOI MAY </p><p>STILL NEED TO SEEK FUNDING FOR THE DEPLOYMENT, BUT WE DO NOT </p><p>FORESEE ANY PROBLEMS ON THAT FRONT.   WE EXPECT BERLUSONI </p><p>WILL BE DISCUSSING UK-ITALY PHASE IV COOPERATION DURING HIS </p><p>DINNER WITH PM BLAIR ON APRIL 30. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01833 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
