<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 CAIRO 21221 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PINR, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD:  EAGER FOR U.S. CONTACTS, </p><p>FEARFUL OF GOE </p><p> </p><p>1.  S-ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  THREE STRONG IMPRESSIONS EMERGED FROM </p><p>EMBOFF\'S INTRODUCTORY CALL ON THE NEW MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p>LEADERSHIP SEPTEMBER 10:  (1) CURRENT LEADERSHIP IS KEEN </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S. EMBASSY; (2) </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS VERY WORRIED ABOUT AVOIDING </p><p>PROBLEMS WITH THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR; AND (3) </p><p>NEW SUPREME GUIDE ABUL  NASR APPEARS MORE A FIGUREHEAD </p><p>THAN THE REAL POWER WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP, WHO MAY BE </p><p>DEPUTY MUSTAFA MASHHUR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  POLOFF AND POL FSN MADE FIRST OFFICIAL CONTACT </p><p>WITH MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD LEADERSHIP SINCE DEATH LAST MAY </p><p>OF PREVIOUS SUPREME GUIDE OMAR TALMASSANI, MEETING AT </p><p>OFFICES PREVIOUSLY USED BY BANNED MB MAGAZINE AL-DA\'WA </p><p>SEPTEMBER 10.  CORDIAL BUT SHORT MEETING WAS DEVOTED </p><p>ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO WHY THE MEETING COULD NOT TAKE </p><p>PLACE AT GREATER LENGTH AS PLANNED.  DEPUTY SUPREME </p><p>GUIDE MUSTAFA MASHHUR HAD POSITIVELY AND PROMPTLY </p><p>RESPONDED TO EMBASSY REQUEST SEPTEMBER 9 FOR THE CALL </p><p>ON NEW SUPREME GUIDE MUHAMMED HAMAD ABUL NASR, BUT HAD </p><p>ASKED EMBASSY TO SECURE MINISTRY  OF INTERIOR CLEARANCE. </p><p>WISHING TO AVOID THE PRECEDENT OF REQUESTING SUCH </p><p>ADVANCE CLEARANCE  FOR DIPLOMATIC WORK, EMBOFF </p><p>APPEARED AT THE APPOINTED TIME AND PLACE WITHOUT </p><p>MININT CLEARANCE.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE CALL WAS </p><p>ROUTINE COURTESY CALL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  MASHHUR AND ABUL NASR CORDIALLY WELCOMED POLOFF AND </p><p>FSN, OFFERED THE CUSTOMARY SWEETS, AND MET WITH THEM FOR </p><p>ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES.  HOWEVER, IN THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>A MALE SECRETARY TAKING APPARENTLY VERBATIM NOTES, </p><p>MASHHUR AND ABUL NASR REPEATEDLY INSISTED ON THE NEED </p><p>FOR THE EMBASSY TO SECURE WRITTEN PERMISSION FOR THE </p><p>MB TO MEET WITH EMBOFFS -- INSISTING EQUALLY STRONGLY </p><p>UPON THEIR WELCOME OF CONTINUED CONTACTS WITH THE </p><p>EMBASSY.  THEY STATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MEET EMBOFF </p><p>AT LENGTH ASAP -- EVEN LATER THE SAME DAY, OR IN THE </p><p>NEXT FEW DAYS -- PROVIDED THE WRITTEN PERMISSION WAS </p><p>FORTHCOMING FROM THE MININT.  THEY EXPLAINED THAT IN </p><p>THE PAST THE GOE HAD PROVIDED VERBAL APPROVAL FOR MB </p><p>CONTACTS WITH THE BRITISH EMBASSY, AND YET HAD CITED </p><p>THESE CONTACTS AS ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES WHEN IT FOUND THIS </p><p>USEFUL AGAINST THE MB.  POLOFF NOTED, TO NO AVAIL, </p><p>THAT EMBASSY OFFICERS HAD HAD PERIODIC TALKS WITH </p><p>TALMASSANI IN THE TWO YEARS PRECEDING HIS DEATH. </p><p>MB INTERLOCUTORS CONCEDED THIS POINT, ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>EMBASSY MAINTAINS CONTACTS EVEN WITH POLITICAL OPPOSITION </p><p>FIGURES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS WORK, AND NOTED </p><p>THAT THE MB IS ALSO FREE TO MEET WITH JOURNALISTS . </p><p>NONETHELESS, THEY INSISTED THAT EGYPTIAN LAW REQUIRES </p><p>THE MB TO SECURE PERMISSION TO MEET REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>OF ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.  THEY WERE CAREFUL TO </p><p>ASK THAT EMBASSY SECURE A GENERAL MININT CLEARANCE </p><p>THAT WOULD PERMIT REPEATED CONTACTS WITH  MORE THAN </p><p>ONE EMBASSY OFFICER, SO THAT WRITTEN PERMISSION WOULD </p><p>NOT HAVE TO BE OBTAINED FOR EACH MEETING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  POLOFF EXPRESSED FULL RESPECT FOR EGYPTIAN LAW AND </p><p>UNDERSTANDING FOR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD\'S CONCERNS. </p><p>HE STATED HIS HOPE THAT THE ISSUE COULD BE RESOLVED </p><p>QUICKLY TO PERMIT AN EARLY RETURN MEETING FOR THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF PROMOTING MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.  BEFORE TAKING </p><p>LEAVE, HE ALSO CONVEYED EMBASSY\'S RESPECT FOR THOSE </p><p>PRESENT AND FOR THE ROLE OF ISLAM IN EGYPTIAN SOCIETY. </p><p>MASHHUR AND ABUL NASR RESPONDED WARMLY AND AGAIN </p><p>STATED THEIR WELCOME FOR CONTACTS WITH THE EMBASSY, </p><p>"BOTH AS MUSLIMS AND AS ARABS." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  IMPRESSIONS FROM THIS EXCHANGE: </p><p> </p><p>(1) THE MB IS EAGER TO STEP UP CONTACTS WITH THE U.S. </p><p>EMBASSY.  WE CAN ONLY SURMISE THAT, APART FROM WHATEVER </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL THINKING THIS DESIRE MAY REFLECT, ONE </p><p>MOTIVE MAY BE TO ADD TO THE MB\'S LEGITIMACY AS A </p><p>POLITICAL ENTITY. </p><p> </p><p>(2) THE SUCCESSOR LEADERSHIP IS MORE CONCERNED TO </p><p>STAY CLEAR OF PROBLEMS WITH THE GOE.  TALMASSANI HAD </p><p>NOT REQUESTED PRIOR CLEARANCE, AT LEAST NOT VIA </p><p>THIS EMBASSY, FOR HIS SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH EMBOFFS. </p><p>A SEPARATE CONVERSATION BETWEEN POLOFF AND A JOURNALIST </p><p>CONNECTED TO THE MB INDICATED THAT THE MB IS VERY </p><p>CONCERNED OVER THE RECENT WELL-PUBLICIZED ARRESTS </p><p>OF NON-MB FUNDAMENTALISTS.  THIS APPARENT GOE CRACKDOWN </p><p>ON NON-MB FUNDAMENTALISTS MAY BE ONE FACTOR BEHIND </p><p>THE MB\'S UNPRECEDENTED INSISTENCE UPON MININT </p><p>CLEARANCE TO MEET WITH US. </p><p> </p><p>(3) MB LEADERSHIP APPEARED TO LACK SELF CONFIDENCE </p><p>AND COHESION.  THIS MAY BE ANOTHER FACTOR BEHIND </p><p>ITS CAUTION.  ABUL NASR APPEARED PHYSICALLY FRAIL </p><p>AND MORE A FIGUREHEAD THAN THE DOMINANT PRESENCE </p><p>IN THE MEETING.  HIS COMPLEXION WAS SALLOW AND HIS </p><p>WESTERN BUSINESS SUIT HUNG ON HIM LOOSELY.  HIS VOICE </p><p>WAS RASPY AND UNSTEADY, AND HIS VERY THICK EYEGLASSES </p><p>MAY INDICATE FAILING VISION.  ALTHOUGH ABUL NASR </p><p>SAT IN THE POSITION OF HONOR BEHIND A DESK,  MASHHUR, </p><p>ACROSS THE ROOM ON A COUCH, WAS THE MORE IMPOSING </p><p>FIGURE.  MASHHUR, APPARENTLY IN HIS MID-SIXTIES, </p><p>WAS RESPECTFUL -- HE DID NOT INTERRUPT ABUL NASR -- </p><p>BUT NOT DEFERENTIAL.  HE CLEARLY DOMINATED THE </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH STEADY VOICE AND EYECONTACT, AND </p><p>THE MB NOTETAKER LOOKED REPEATEDLY TOWARD MASHHUR AS </p><p>HE TRANSCRIBED THE CONVERSATION.   MOREOVER, </p><p>OUTER OFFICE MB STAFF COMMENTS TO POLOFF OF PROFOUND </p><p>REGRET OVER LOSS OF TALMASSANI SEEMED INTENDED TO </p><p>CONVEY PERCEPTIONS OF ABUL NASR\'S INADEQUACY AS A </p><p>SUCCESSOR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  WE DO NOT INTEND TO GET IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE </p><p>SHAKY MB LEADERSHIP AND GOE.  BEYOND ITS OWN CONCERNS, </p><p>TALMASSANI\'S SUCCESSORS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE US TO </p><p>TEST WHETHER THE MININT IS READY TO BESTOW LEGITIMACY </p><p>UPON THE MB.  THROUGH CASUAL LOW KEY CONTACTS IN THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY, WE INTEND TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR </p><p>NORMAL DIPLOMATIC WORK HERE INCLUDES CONTACTS ACROSS THE </p><p>WIDE SPECTRUM OF EGYPTIAN SOCIETY.  WE SHALL CONTINUE TO </p><p>PURSUE CONTACTS WITH THE MB, MAKING CLEAR TO THEM ALSO </p><p>THAT WE HAVE REMINDED THE MFA OF OUR GENERAL APPROACH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WISNER </p><p></p></div>
