In Kirkuk, the 30-member city council was chosen by Coalition </p><p>authorities on 24 May.  Each of the main ethnic groups (Kurds, </p><p>Turkmen, Assyrians, and Arabs) is represented on the council, </p><p>which has also elected three assistant mayors: an ethnic Turk, an </p><p>Assyrian, and a Kurd.  A mayor and deputy mayor were chosen on </p><p>May 28.  The mayor is a Kurd, and the deputy mayor is an Arab. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ORHA reported that the USD 20 emergency payments were ready </p><p>and would be distributed immediately following the elections. </p><p>The security situation in northern Iraq is currently calm; </p><p>however, the attack on a U.S. Military convoy about 100 </p><p>kilometers north of Baghdad is still an indicator that not all is </p><p>well.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MORAD) hosted </p><p>on 24 May its weekly coordination meeting, at which the United </p><p>Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS) presented the results </p><p>of a recent survey of internally displaced persons (IDPs) living </p><p>in public buildings.  In an exercise that ended in early May, </p><p>UNOPS surveyed 13,359 IDP families living in 300 public buildings </p><p>in the three northern Governorates of Dahuk, Arbil, and As </p><p>Sulaymaniyah. </p><p> </p><p>3.  According to a 2001 U.N.-HABITAT Site and Family Survey, </p><p>there are 805,505 IDPs living in the Kurdish-controlled region of </p><p>Iraq.  Three quarters of these people were displaced prior to </p><p>1990, either as a result of the former regime\'s "Arabization" </p><p>program or the al Anfal campaign.  Almost half of the IDPs are </p><p>from former Government of Iraq-controlled areas, most from the </p><p>cities of Kirkuk and Mosul. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The full results of the survey can be found on the </p><p>Humanitarian Information Center\'s website at </p><p>agoodplacetostart.org.  Some selective results presented in the </p><p>MORAD meeting were: </p><p> </p><p>--  Timetable:  61 percent of the respondents in As Sulaymaniyah </p><p>and 52 percent of the respondents in Arbil said they would like </p><p>to return to their place of origin within three months.  However, </p><p>64 percent of the respondents in Dahuk did not provide a </p><p>timeframe for return.  Apparently this is because the majority of </p><p>IDPs in Dahuk are from areas bordering Turkey that are lesser- </p><p>developed and still unstable because of activities by the </p><p>Kurdistan Worker\'s Party (PKK) and the Turkish military. </p><p> </p><p>--  Conditions for return:  66 percent of those surveyed said the </p><p>most important condition for return is shelter.  After shelter, </p><p>respondents cited security (12 percent), employment (9 percent), </p><p>and legal claims (4 percent).  Only 0.3 percent cited food as a </p><p>condition. </p><p> </p><p>--  Where to go:  69 percent of the respondents want to return to </p><p>their place of origin.  19 percent want to be resettled where </p><p>they currently live, and 12 percent want to go to a third </p><p>location. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>5.  A DART food officer traveled to Kirkuk on 26 May and met with </p><p>WFP and Ministry of Trade (MOT) staff.  Following insecurity in </p><p>Kirkuk and recent looting of MOT stocks, newly arrived Coalition </p><p>forces are now guarding WFP\'s warehouse and its perimeter.  WFP </p><p>believes this will deter potential looters.  According to MOT </p><p>silo staff in Kirkuk, Coalition forces also have agreed to secure </p><p>other MOT complexes, although this has not yet happened. </p><p> </p><p>6.  As previously reported, beginning 27 May, WFP Mosul and </p><p>Kirkuk will begin receiving up to 115,000 metric tons (MT) of </p><p>bulk wheat grain over the next two weeks.  WFP will store the </p><p>grain at MOT silos in the two Governorates.  An initial shipment </p><p>of 30,000 MT will go to Mosul.  The DART will monitor the </p><p>shipments. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WFP recently signed an agreement with the MOT to store 50,000 </p><p>MT of wheat in open bins at its Kirkuk silo.  There is currently </p><p>60,000 MT of last year\'s wheat harvest in other bins there and, </p><p>reportedly, a total of 140,000 MT in the Governorate\'s four </p><p>silos.  The wheat currently stored in Kirkuk appears to be in </p><p>good condition.  MOT staff were awaiting instructions from </p><p>Baghdad on how milling will be done; previously the mix had been </p><p>25 percent local wheat and 75 percent Oil for Food imported </p><p>wheat. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The MOT silo manager stated that he needs 35 million Iraqi </p><p>Dinar (ID) a month to pay staff salaries at all four silos (based </p><p>on pre-war rates).  On 25 May, he used seven million ID from the </p><p>MOT Kirkuk silo bank account (the balance was 16 million ID) to </p><p>pay a 20 percent salary to all silo employees.  The manager noted </p><p>that neither the USD 20 emergency payment nor a formal salary </p><p>from the Coalition Provisional Administration had yet been made </p><p>to his staff. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>DART-FUNDED NGO ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>9.
