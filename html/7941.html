<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000860 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  GOVERNMENT HOLDS SECOND ROUND OF DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH MAOIST INSURGENTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 0837 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On May 9 Government of Nepal (GON) negotiators held a </p><p>second round of talks with Maoist insurgents at a hotel in </p><p>Kathmandu (located less than one km from the Embassy).  The </p><p>talks concluded more quickly than the first round, held April </p><p>27, ending after only two and a half hours.  As of 4:00 P.M. </p><p>local time May 9, neither the GON nor the Maoists had </p><p>announced to the press the results of this latest round.  No </p><p>date for a subsequent round of talks has yet been announced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Police sources said that this latest round produced </p><p>three significant agreements.  First, the GON reportedly </p><p>agreed that soldiers from the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) would </p><p>patrol no farther than five km outside their barracks. </p><p>Second, the GON committed to releasing three Maoist Central </p><p>Committee Member detainees, and to providing information on </p><p>the whereabouts of another 320 Maoist detainees.  Third, both </p><p>sides agreed to the establishment of a 13-member committee to </p><p>monitor compliance with the ceasefire code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) A partial list of the members of the monitoring </p><p>committee provided by police sources includes six names of </p><p>individuals (four of them openly sympathetic to the Maoists), </p><p>with the remaining seven unnamed members designated by </p><p>membership in other organizations (i.e., a member of the </p><p>National Human Rights Commission; a member of the Bar </p><p>Association; a member of the National Women\'s Commission; a </p><p>member of the journalists association; a member of the </p><p>National Chamber of Commerce).  Another member, Hem Bahadur </p><p>Singh, is a former Inspector General of Police. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  At first glance, the GON appears to have </p><p>ceded more territory in this latest round than they have </p><p>gained.  Allowing the RNA to patrol at all--even if limited </p><p>to a 5-km radius around their barracks--represents at best a </p><p>minor concession for the Maoists, who had been demanding that </p><p>the troops be confined to barracks.  The GON had indicated </p><p>earlier its willingness to release the last few members of </p><p>the Central Committee still detained.  Its decision to do so </p><p>now, after the conclusion of the second round of talks is </p><p>likely intended as a show of good faith.  It is too early to </p><p>tell if the final composition of the monitoring team will be </p><p>more politically balanced than it appears at present; much </p><p>depends on the affiliations of the remaining seven </p><p>individuals to be identified.  It is difficult to determine, </p><p>based on these preliminary reports, the extent of GON </p><p>concessions.  If our sources\' descriptions are accurate, it </p><p>seems likely that the GON commitments are intended as </p><p>confidence-building measures to maintain momentum--and thus </p><p>popular support--for dialogue. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
