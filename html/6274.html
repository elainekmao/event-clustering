<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 OTTAWA 000679 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; NORTH KOREA </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Liberating Iraqis is main justification for war" </p><p>Columnist Rosie DiManno writing from Jordan made the </p><p>following observations in the liberal Toronto Star </p><p>(3/10): "The most urgent and compelling reason </p><p>for invading Iraq is the one never mentioned by </p><p>bickering diplomats at the United Nations: 24 million </p><p>Iraqis, 24 years of barbarous misrule, government by </p><p>thuggery.... But world leaders are pragmatic and </p><p>utterly selfish, with a keen eye to geopolitical </p><p>interests, even as they invest themselves with noble </p><p>motives - all this duplicitous keening about avoiding a </p><p>catastrophic war. That might be what drove millions of </p><p>people around the world to protest against war in Iraq, </p><p>but it has precious little to do with the bellicose </p><p>objections in Washington, Paris, Beijing, and let\'s </p><p>throw in Berlin, which at least can honestly attest to </p><p>the disastrous consequences of military belligerence. </p><p>The Germans have been chastened into an appreciation </p><p>for peace and diplomacy.... There are a multitude of </p><p>reasons for attacking Iraq. It\'s </p><p>to the United States\' discredit that U.S. President </p><p>George W. Bush has done such a poor job of itemizing </p><p>them. He botched the rightness of war by only latterly </p><p>addressing the liberation of Iraqis, which should have </p><p>been first on the list, and which British Prime </p><p>Minister Tony Blair has managed to put at the centre of </p><p>his war threat. Washington has cast about for </p><p>validations of war: first it was about protecting </p><p>American security from Saddam\'s nasty weapons cache; </p><p>then it was about the security of Israel, then the </p><p>security of the region, then Saddam\'s alleged links to </p><p>Al Qaeda, and finally a stunning democratization of the </p><p>Mideast, starting in Baghdad. No wonder the public\'s </p><p>confused, credulous.... I don\'t understand why </p><p>liberating Iraqis - Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds, Christians, </p><p>Turkomans - from despotic tyranny has such little moral </p><p>traction. I don\'t understand why the basic human values </p><p>so precious to Canadians are deemed a luxury too taxing </p><p>for the international community to deliver to Iraq. I </p><p>don\'t understand the U.N.\'s continuing tolerance of </p><p>rogue regimes, so long as they don\'t export tyranny </p><p>beyond their borders. I don\'t understand why the Iraqi </p><p>people matter so little." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "War against Iraq senseless" </p><p>Columnist Tom Brodbeck stated in the conservative </p><p>tabloid Winnipeg Sun (3/10): "It\'s one thing for the </p><p>United States and their so-called coalition of the </p><p>willing to argue that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is </p><p>a menace to the world who ought to be extinguished. </p><p>It\'s quite another for them to bomb Baghdad without the </p><p>approval of the United Nations and argue they\'re doing </p><p>so to enforce a series of broken UN resolutions. That\'s </p><p>hypocrisy in its purest form. If the U.S. and others </p><p>feel they have enough justification to declare war </p><p>against Iraq, whatever that justification may be, </p><p>nobody can really stop them. But I wish they wouldn\'t </p><p>insult my intelligence by telling me they\'re doing so </p><p>to enforce a series of UN resolutions.... The UN passes </p><p>resolutions all the time. But they have rules on how </p><p>those resolutions should be enforced. They have a </p><p>Security Council with voting members who have the sole </p><p>authority to enforce those resolutions. Anyone else, </p><p>including a `coalition of the willing,\' who tries to </p><p>enforce them is not enforcing UN resolutions, they are </p><p>acting outside the UN. You can\'t have it both ways. You </p><p>can\'t say you\'re enforcing UN resolutions and then spit </p><p>in the eye of the institution that created them. It\'s </p><p>one of the many deficiencies in the pro-war argument. </p><p>Another major flaw is the argument that Iraq is </p><p>`linked\' to terrorist cells, whatever that means.... </p><p>But when asked for evidence that Iraq was behind 9/11, </p><p>the White House always fails to deliver.... It\'s </p><p>perhaps that assertion that erodes Bush\'s credibility </p><p>more than any other. When you don\'t have a strong case </p><p>for action, you reach. And George W. is reaching.... </p><p>The bottom line today, though, is that nothing is going </p><p>to happen overnight in Iraq, except for a possible U.S.- </p><p>led war.... The United Nations is combing though Iraq </p><p>looking for and actively destroying arms. UN chief </p><p>inspector Hans Blix is reporting continued progress and </p><p>co-operation. The eye of the world is on Iraq and they </p><p>can\'t attack anyone or really do anything. They\'re </p><p>incarcerated. </p><p>Under these circumstances, I don\'t know how any logical </p><p>thinking person could in good conscience approve of </p><p>military action against Iraq, killing tens of thousands </p><p>of innocent people, creating an explosively dangerous </p><p>environment in the Persian Gulf and substantially </p><p>increasing the threat of terrorism in the United </p><p>States. It simply makes no sense." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "Arrogant Bush sets stage for final U.N. showdown" </p><p>Editorial page editor Haroon Siddiqui suggested in the </p><p>liberal Toronto Star (3/9) that, "George W. Bush has </p><p>brought the world to the brink of one war and plunged </p><p>it into another: the war that he is hell-bent on </p><p>unleashing on Iraq, and the other on the diplomatic </p><p>front, where he has torpedoed the Atlantic alliance, </p><p>undermined moderate Muslim allies and is about to sink </p><p>the system of international law that has helped govern </p><p>the world since World War II. For this, we can blame </p><p>Saddam Hussein, of course, but also America - more </p><p>precisely, the Bush administration. Its unmatched </p><p>arrogance, staggering dishonesty and extraordinary </p><p>incompetence at international relations have </p><p>set the stage for the coming week\'s showdown, not </p><p>between enemies but friends.... Since last week, the </p><p>Bush mission has also been about establishing democracy </p><p>in Iraq and liberating Iraqis from Saddam\'s tyranny - </p><p>the strongest moral point in the American arsenal but </p><p>totally ineffective in light of its own past patronage </p><p>of the tyrant, its callous discounting of Iraqi </p><p>suffering under economic sanctions and the fact that </p><p>its bombs will kill many Iraqis before freeing them. </p><p>American disdain for international law </p><p>is also on display in the stepped-up bombing of Iraqi </p><p>defences in and around the north and south no-fly </p><p>zones.... So, the war has begun before it has begun.... </p><p>Meanwhile, the simplest and the most profound questions </p><p>remain unanswered: Why war now, especially when it </p><p>lacks international legitimacy, </p><p>both in law and in the court of world public opinion? </p><p>Why abandon the inspections precisely when they are </p><p>beginning to work? Why risk the entire U.N. system? Why </p><p>risk geopolitical upheaval? More importantly, why risk </p><p>inflicting a humanitarian catastrophe on an already </p><p>crushed people?" </p><p> </p><p>4.   "There must be a better \'bastard\'" </p><p>Former publisher Hartley Steward commented in the </p><p>conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (3/9): "Of all the </p><p>bastards in the world available to hate these days, </p><p>surely Americans are the least intelligent choice.... </p><p>In fact, President Bush and his administration, in </p><p>light of the Twin Towers attack, have shown surprising </p><p>restraint. They have tried patiently to explain their </p><p>intent to a world often reluctant to listen. They have </p><p>painstakingly made their case. It is downright absurd </p><p>to direct hatred toward the U.S. as if the world\'s only </p><p>superpower could not be a victim. Absurd and </p><p>transparently opportunistic. The new rules of war, the </p><p>suicide bomber\'s and the terrorist\'s rationale that no </p><p>one is innocent in war, make it entirely possible. It </p><p>is so obvious, one is almost embarrassed to point it </p><p>out: the real object of hatred here is Osama bin Laden </p><p>and his Islamic extremists. We should save our curses </p><p>for the madmen who flew airliners into the Trade Center </p><p>towers, killing innocents who were doing nothing more </p><p>than putting in a day\'s work. We should direct our </p><p>animosity toward rogue states like Iraq who refuse to </p><p>comply with UN disarmament orders; who thumb their </p><p>noses at the free world. We should husband our hatred </p><p>for the psychotic and brutal dictators who rule by fear </p><p>and murder and employ poison gas against their own </p><p>people. We should save our name-calling for those who </p><p>seek and build weapons of mass destruction to let loose </p><p>on the world. It is Saddam Hussein who is the bastard </p><p>here." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "France is a true friend" </p><p>Foreign affairs columnist Eric Margolis observed in the </p><p>conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (3/9): "...It seems at </p><p>times that President Bush is even more </p><p>eager to bomb Paris than Baghdad. In fact, the </p><p>administration has been treating France like an enemy, </p><p>rather than America\'s oldest ally and intimate friend. </p><p>Neo-conservatives even accuse France of anti-Semitism, </p><p>a disgusting slander. Far from being an enemy, France </p><p>has been doing what a true good friend should do: </p><p>telling Washington its policy is wrong and dangerous, </p><p>unlike the handkissing leaders of Britain, Spain and </p><p>Italy, who crave Bush\'s political support, or the East </p><p>European coalition of the shilling, ex-communist </p><p>politicians pandering to Washington for cash.... </p><p>Bush\'s crusade against Iraq will go on with or without </p><p>Turkey. The war will be akin to throwing a grenade into </p><p>a huge hornet\'s nest. France, which lives next to the </p><p>Arab world and has 5 million Muslim citizens, warns an </p><p>invasion and occupation of Iraq will roil the entire </p><p>region, spark more terrorism, and hit Europe with a </p><p>dangerous backblast. But Bush couldn\'t care less, as he </p><p>would say. While Bush prepares war against demolished </p><p>Iraq, he is ducking the surging nuclear confrontation </p><p>with North Korea, which, unlike Iraq, truly threatens </p><p>North America.... America\'s friends and neighbours, led </p><p>by France, the mother of  diplomacy, rightly warn the </p><p>steroidal Bush </p><p>administration to halt its rush to war. President </p><p>Chirac and Foreign Minister de Villepin deserve the </p><p>Nobel Peace Prize. Americans owe France an apology, and </p><p>a hearty \'merci mon ami\'" </p><p> </p><p>6.   "The damage done without a shot being fired" </p><p>Columnist Jeffrey Simpson remarked in the leading Globe </p><p>and Mail (3/8): "...Those who believe that inspections </p><p>are working and can produce additional positive results </p><p>must concede the point: Inspections would fail without </p><p>a credible threat of force. Or they would make such </p><p>little progress as to mock the latest UN resolution\'s </p><p>demand for \'immediate, active and </p><p>unconditional\' disarmament. You can\'t have one without </p><p>the other, and it is naive to believe otherwise. Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s regime will never disarm, in whole or in </p><p>part, without the threat of being toppled in a war.... </p><p>The French and most of the world opposed military </p><p>action because they feared its consequences; the </p><p>Americans and their few allies supported such action </p><p>because they feared the consequences of no action. </p><p>Without a shot being fired, enormous damage has already </p><p>been done to the transatlantic arrangements that stood </p><p>these countries in such good stead for so many decades. </p><p>To the Americans, it will seem axiomatic now that their </p><p>great German friends and their perfidious French ones </p><p>will play the anti-American card, so that neither they </p><p>nor the disorganized European Union should be factored </p><p>into future U.S. foreign policy decisions. Nor should </p><p>the </p><p>increasingly irrelevant NATO.... The more the United </p><p>States feels itself abandoned, misunderstood and </p><p>opposed by countries it had counted on as friends, the </p><p>less it will reflect on what it has done to bring about </p><p>this state of affairs than on the weakness, </p><p>unreliability and fecklessness of those erstwhile </p><p>friends whose support is not worth all the bother." </p><p> </p><p>7.   "A deadline fit for the Security Council" </p><p>The leading Globe and Mail editorialized (3/8): </p><p>"...[I]sn\'t an ultimatum precisely what\'s necessary? </p><p>Isn\'t the credible prospect of war precisely what is </p><p>needed now to avoid it, by forcing an Iraqi change of </p><p>heart?... Ultimately...the issue isn\'t a precise date. </p><p>It is the need to bring this to a head. Mr. Hussein\'s </p><p>game of cat-and-mouse cannot be allowed to continue. </p><p>And the U.S. and British troops cannot remain </p><p>indefinitely in a state of battle readiness. The </p><p>members of the UN Security Council came together last </p><p>November and unanimously passed Resolution 1441. They </p><p>should come together again early next week and pass the </p><p>resolution giving Mr. Hussein a final deadline of March </p><p>17. War may still be the outcome. But, if so, Mr. </p><p>Hussein will have been given every chance to avoid it." </p><p> </p><p>8.   "The hawks of Iraq" </p><p>The conservative National Post opined (3/8): "...We </p><p>concede there are real arguments for opposing war - </p><p>though we do not find them convincing. Peaceniks, </p><p>however, should resist the urge to use Saddam\'s victims </p><p>as props. It is ordinary Iraqis who have the most to </p><p>gain from a U.S.-led invasion, and the most to lose </p><p>should war opponents get their way." </p><p> </p><p>9.   "Enough of the weasel words." </p><p>The conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun declared (3/8): </p><p>"...[L]et\'s give Saddam one last, last chance - an 18th </p><p>resolution giving him until March 17 to disarm - only </p><p>11 days sooner than the March 28 deadline in the </p><p>\'Canadian compromise.\' But then the UN must show </p><p>whether it is relevant. If Saddam chooses not to </p><p>comply, then we believe that even if the war resolution </p><p>fails to gather the necessary nine of 15 Security </p><p>Council votes, or if France, China or Russia vetoes it, </p><p>then the U.S. and Great Britain should lead a coalition </p><p>of willing nations to disarm Saddam. </p><p>He is a tyrant. </p><p>He terrorizes his own people. </p><p>He has attacked three neighbours. </p><p>He has pursued weapons of mass destruction. </p><p>He supports terrorists and terrorism. </p><p>Should he supply chemical or biological weapons to </p><p>terrorists, the world will see a horror that would </p><p>dwarf 9/11. Back down now and the UN will send </p><p>a message to tyrants and terrorists everywhere that it </p><p>is open season on the rest of us. Time to decide." </p><p> </p><p>NORTH KOREA </p><p>10.  "They could be on their own" </p><p>Editor emeritus Peter Worthington wrote in the </p><p>conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (3/10): "...This may </p><p>sound ingenuous, but what America should do seems </p><p>obvious. Dealing with North Korea is even simpler than </p><p>dealing with the South. There\'s growing unrest in South </p><p>Korea against the U.S. military presence which, since </p><p>the ceasefire in the war 50 years ago, has protected </p><p>the South from the North.... Some think America should </p><p>forget about Saddam Hussein and concentrate on bringing </p><p>North Korea to heel. That said, the nasty anti-American </p><p>demonstrations in South Korea demanding the U.S. </p><p>military leave are upsetting.... What\'s hard to </p><p>understand is why the </p><p>Americans stay if South Koreans want them gone. True, </p><p>the majority want American troops handy and know the </p><p>North is up to no good, but the massive protests that </p><p>lambaste the U.S. must irritate the hell out of </p><p>Americans. If I were President George Bush, I\'d be </p><p>tempted to say to South Korea - publicly and bluntly - </p><p>that if you want us gone, we\'ll go; you work out what </p><p>you can with your fruitcake neighbour. That\'d panic </p><p>South Koreans, and restore common sense.... Although </p><p>North Korea\'s nuclear weapons program is no direct </p><p>threat to America, selling nuclear technology to rogue </p><p>regimes and terrorists is. This is all Kim Jong-il has </p><p>to sell.... North Korea wants - demands - direct </p><p>negotiations with the U.S., which, in turn, prefers </p><p>multinational talks that include Russia, China, </p><p>Australia and Japan. Since Kim Jong Il reneges on </p><p>agreements and his word means nothing, why talk? What </p><p>North Korea wants is bribes and payoffs. Blackmail. All </p><p>it has to barter are weapons and soldiers. North Korea </p><p>has no allies, with the possible exception of Cuba\'s </p><p>Fidel Castro.... The soft approach rarely works with </p><p>tyrants. Once Saddam Hussein has been eliminated, North </p><p>Korea should be duck soup, providing President Bush </p><p>doesn\'t waver or waffle." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
