END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. RUUD LUBBERS, UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR) </p><p>AND JIM MORRIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WORLD FOOD PROGRAM </p><p>(WFP) SIGNED ON JULY 9 A REVISED MOU AIMED AT STRENGTHERNING </p><p>COPPERATION AT THE FIELD LEVEL IN DELIVERING FOOD AID TO </p><p>REFUGEES, RETURNEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS) </p><p>WORLDWIDE. CLAUSE 5.8 OF THE REVISION STATES: "ON A PILOT </p><p>BASIS AND FOR AN INITIAL DURATION OF 12 MONTHS (PER </p><p>COUNTRY), WFP WILL ASSUME, AT ITS OWN COST, RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR THE FINAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE BASIC FOOD RATION IN FIVE </p><p>REFUGEE PROGRAMMES. THE PILOT COUNTRY PROGRAMMES WILL BE </p><p>SELECTED JOINTLY BY UNHCR AND WFP BASED UPON JOINTLY AGREED </p><p>CRITERIA AND IN CONSULTATION WITH THE CONCERNED WFP/UNHCR </p><p>COUNTRY TEAMS." </p><p> </p><p>3. WFP HEADQUARTERS HAS ADVISED USMISSION THAT BOTH UN </p><p>AGENCIES HAVE NOW AGREED ON TESTING WFP FINAL DISTRIBUTION </p><p>OF BASIC FOOD COMMODITIES IN REFUGEE OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN, </p><p>UGANDA AND SIERRA LEONE. TANZANIA, GUINEA AND BANGLADESH - </p><p>REMAIN UNDER ACTIVE DISCUSSION FOR THE REMAINING TWO PILOT </p><p>TESTS. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN THE AGREED UPON COUNTRY OPERATIONS, WFP WOULD ASSUME </p><p>THE LEAD IN NEGOTIATING THE TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT AND </p><p>DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH IMPLEMENTING PARTNER NON-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) FOR FINAL FOOD ASSISTANCE DISTRIBUTION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05806  01 OF 02  030842Z </p><p>TO BENEFICIARIES. NOTE: THIS IS STANDARD PRACTICE FOR WFP IN </p><p>NON-REFUGEE PROGRAMS, AND WFP BELIEVES THAT THIS PILOT </p><p>APPROACH COULD RESULT IN AN OVERALL COST-SAVINGS TO DONORS. </p><p>WFP IS ALSO OF THE VIEW THAT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FOOD </p><p>DISTRIBUTION WOULD ALSO IMPROVE SINCE ONLY ONE AGENCY (I.E., </p><p>WFP) WOULD RETAIN OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FROM START TO </p><p>FINISH. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>5. FOR THE FIVE PILOT COUNTRIES IN WHICH WFP WILL TAKE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR FOOD DISTRIBUTION, WFP AND UNHCR WILL </p><p>ENACT TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS SO AS TO ENSURE A SMOOTH HAND- </p><p>OVER OF RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES. AT THE END OF A YEAR\'S </p><p>TRIAL PER COUNTRY, THE PILOT ACTIVITIES WILL BE JOINTLY </p><p>EVALUATED. THE FINDINGS OF THAT EVALUATION AND ITS </p><p>IMPLICATIONS WILL THEN BE THE SUBJECT OF FURTHER DISCUSSIONS </p><p>BETWEEN UNHCR AND WFP. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE FIVE PILOTS WILL IMPLY </p><p>ADJUSTMENTS IN THE OPERATIONAL BUDGETS OF BOTH UNHCR AND </p><p>WFP, EQUIVALENT TO THE COST OF ONWARD MOVEMENT OF FOOD </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9386 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05806  02 OF 02  030842Z </p><p>ACTION PRM-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-00  E-00     UTED-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      SA-00    FMP-00   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------11CC5B  030849Z /38 </p><p>P 030715Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7146 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY KAMPALA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD </p><p>AMEMBASSY FREETOWN </p><p>AMEMBASSY DAR ES SALAAM </p><p>AMEMBASSY DHAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CONAKRY </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERN </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2450 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2981 </p><p> </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005806 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05806  02 OF 02  030842Z </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AS/PRM DEWEY, PRM/P, DAS/IO SANDERS AND IO/D </p><p>USAID FOR A/AID, AA/DCHA, AA/AFR, DCHA/FFP, PPC/DP, PPC/DC </p><p>USDA/FAS/FOR CHAMBLISS/TILLSWORTH </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA AND NKYLOH/USAID </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USAID PLERNER </p><p>USUN FOR CSERWER </p><p>NSC FOR JDWOKEN </p><p>OMB FOR TSTOLL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, EAGR, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, KUNR </p><p>SUBJECT:  PROGRESS ON UNHCR-WFP MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING </p><p>SIGNED ON JULY 9 - SELECTION OF THREE PILOT COUNTRIES FOR </p><p>DIRECT WFP DELIVERY OF FOOD TO THE END USER </p><p> </p><p>COMMODITIES FROM THE EXTENDED TO THE FINAL DELIVERY POINT </p><p>AND OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISTRIBUTION PER SE. </p><p>AS WE ENTER THE LAST MONTH OF THE CALENDAR YEAR, HOWEVER, </p><p>BOTH UNHCR AND WFP NEED TO BE URGED TO COME TO CLOSURE </p><p>SOONEST ON THE SELECTION OF THE REMAINING TWO PILOT REFUGEE </p><p>OPERATIONS.
