<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002999 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, PRM AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRWA\'S UXO REMOVAL EFFORTS IN JENIN CAMP STYMIED </p><p>BY LACK OF EQUIPMENT AND EXPLOSIVES </p><p> </p><p>REF: JERUSALEM 1271 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>(U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Tel Aviv and </p><p>ConGen Jerusalem. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary and Comment:  UNRWA\'s efforts to remove </p><p>unexploded ordnance (UXO) from Jenin refugee camp remain </p><p>severely hindered by the UN agency\'s inability to procure the </p><p>necessary equipment and explosives.  UNRWA requested Israeli </p><p>authorization to use the equipment and explosives verbally in </p><p>mid-April and in writing on April 23.  UNRWA has not yet </p><p>received any response from the IDF.  However, Israeli </p><p>authorities on June 5 agreed to UNRWA\'s long-standing request </p><p>to hold technical meetings on UXO removal during the week of </p><p>June 10.  Resolution of the equipment issue is crucial. </p><p>Without the proper equipment and explosives, UNRWA can only </p><p>defuse the UXO and either leave it in place or bury it in an </p><p>undisclosed location.  Both options leave the possibility </p><p>that refugees or UNRWA staff could be injured, or Palestinian </p><p>fighters could find and retrieve the UXO.  Neither </p><p>possibility advances U.S. or Israeli interests, and both </p><p>leave UNRWA open to charges of "complicity" in terrorism. </p><p>End Summary and Comment. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In June 4 and 5 telcons, UNRWA West Bank field </p><p>director Richard Cook briefed regional refcoord on UNRWA\'s </p><p>continuing, unsuccessful efforts to procure the equipment </p><p>necessary to remove unexploded ordnance (UXO) from Jenin </p><p>refugee camp.  Cook reported that the situation had changed </p><p>little since mid-April, when the IDF pulled out of Jenin camp </p><p>and UNRWA first requested Israeli assistance.  Although a </p><p>Norwegian demining team had conducted the first UXO removal </p><p>in late April (ref), and UNRWA currently has a four-person </p><p>demining team (one French UNMAS employee, and a </p><p>Swedish-funded team comprised of two British nationals with </p><p>extensive IED experience and a Swedish medic), their efforts </p><p>are severely hampered by the lack of equipment.  As UNRWA had </p><p>explained previously, UXO cannot be disposed of properly </p><p>without explosives.  Citing security concerns, Israeli </p><p>authorities have not granted UNRWA permission to procure the </p><p>explosives. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Cook said that, without the explosives and related </p><p>equipment, UNRWA can move only slowly -- and at great risk -- </p><p>to remove the UXO.  The demining team is having a </p><p>particularly difficult time with improvised explosive devices </p><p>(IED\'s) and unidentified manufactured devices.  Without the </p><p>explosives, the team can only defuse them and then either </p><p>leave them in place or bury them.  As Cook noted, neither </p><p>option is attractive.  Leaving the UXO in place, with no </p><p>means to control pedestrian flow over the destroyed center of </p><p>the camp, leaves refugees and UNRWA employees in danger of </p><p>injury.  (UNRWA officials told refcoord and visiting </p><p>congressional staffers on May 30 that two refugees had been </p><p>killed and dozens wounded by UXO.  While visiting Jenin camp, </p><p>USG officials observed that there were no barriers around the </p><p>destroyed camp center and no means of preventing refugees </p><p>from traversing the mounds of rubble.  UNRWA officials noted </p><p>that the PA\'s ability to secure and police the camp had been </p><p>severely reduced by the IDF operations in Jenin.)  Defusing </p><p>and burying the UXO -- albeit in an undisclosed location -- </p><p>leaves open the possibility that Palestinian fighters could </p><p>find and use it.  It also leaves UNRWA open to charges of </p><p>"complicity" in terrorism.  Nevertheless, Cook said, UNRWA </p><p>has no choice but to move ahead without the equipment.  It </p><p>cannot start rubble removal and reconstruction efforts until </p><p>the UXO is identified and defused. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Cook detailed UNRWA\'s unsuccessful efforts to secure </p><p>Israeli permission to obtain the necessary explosives and </p><p>equipment.  Immediately following the Israeli withdrawal from </p><p>Jenin, UNRWA first approached the IDF with a verbal request </p><p>to provide the equipment and explosives required for UXO </p><p>removal.  The IDF informed UNRWA that it would engage in </p><p>discussions with UNRWA only if UNRWA agreed to provide the </p><p>Israeli government with a complete record (including </p><p>photographs) of all UXO found in the camp.  UNRWA responded </p><p>that it would only turn over the record to the Israeli </p><p>government after all UXO recovery operations had been </p><p>completed.  Cook said UNRWA did not want to put its UXO </p><p>disposal team (the Norwegian team) in any danger, as </p><p>cooperation with the IDF during the UXO removal process </p><p>would, in the eyes of Jenin camp residents, compromise </p><p>UNRWA\'s neutrality.  UNRWA followed this verbal approach with </p><p>an April 23 written request to the IDF, to which it has not </p><p>received a response. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) UNRWA then approached an Israeli private company, </p><p>Goldtec, hoping to contract its services to remove the UXO. </p><p>Goldtec told UNRWA it can supply the equipment, but needs IDF </p><p>authorization to use explosives within Jenin refugee camp. </p><p>According to Cook, Goldtec has not received any response to </p><p>its initial inquiries with Israeli government authorities. </p><p>6.  (C) Cook emphasized to refcoord that UNRWA is trying to </p><p>be reasonable, and would like to engage the Israelis in </p><p>discussions over its specific security concerns.  For </p><p>example, UNRWA would be willing to store the explosives </p><p>outside Jenin refugee camp, under IDF control, and transport </p><p>them to and from the camp at the beginning and end of each </p><p>workday.  Cook reported that the IDF had agreed on June 5 to </p><p>UNRWA\'s long-standing request to hold technical meetings on </p><p>UXO removal during the week of June 10.  He is hopeful that </p><p>the meeting will produce results, but asked that the U.S. </p><p>raise UXO with Israeli authorities if the meeting is not </p><p>productive. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Equipment still required by UNRWA includes: </p><p> </p><p>-     1 x-ray inspector and processor </p><p>-     1 recoilless disrupter and dearmer </p><p>-     1 fiberoptic endoscope/boroscope kit </p><p>-     10 boxes of x-ray film </p><p>-     75 kg high explosives </p><p>-     400 electric detonators </p><p>-     400 m detonating cord </p><p>-     200 electrically initiated cartridges for the dearmer </p><p>-     20 m explosive cutting tape or charge linear cutting </p><p>(CLC) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment: Continuation of the status quo -- slow, </p><p>dangerous UXO defusing operations without proper disposal -- </p><p>serves neither U.S. nor Israeli interests.  It also leaves </p><p>UNRWA unfairly and unnecessarily vulnerable to charges of </p><p>"complicity" in terrorism.  End comment. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
