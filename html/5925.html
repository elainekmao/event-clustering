<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000489 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, PREF, ELAB, SMIG, SNAR, KCRM, KWMN, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY VIEWS ON REGIONAL ANTI-TIP HARMONIZATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 32314 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Embassy concurs that regional </p><p>harmonization of anti-trafficking in persons legislation, as </p><p>outlined in RefTel, would further U.S. interests in </p><p>Guatemala.  Harmonized anti-TIP legislation is necessary to </p><p>achieve greater regional cooperation to prevent and combat </p><p>trafficking, and to protect the rights of victims.  The </p><p>Regional Conference on Migration may be a useful forum in </p><p>which to promote these efforts.  In Guatemala, prospects for </p><p>passage of new anti-TIP legislation is complicated by </p><p>election-year politics.  For this reason, regional </p><p>discussions would be helpful in 2003, while legislative </p><p>efforts are more likely to prosper in 2004. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The following responses are keyed to questions in </p><p>RefTel para 4: </p><p> </p><p>a)  Willingness of key national legislators to introduce and </p><p>promote harmonized anti-TIP legislation: </p><p> </p><p>-- National elections for President, Vice President, all </p><p>Congressional deputies and all Mayors will be held in </p><p>November 2003.  The official campaign period will open in </p><p>May, but political jockeying has already begun, complicating </p><p>the passage of any legislation this year.  For this reason, </p><p>prospects for passage of G/TIP harmonization legislation will </p><p>be better in 2004.  Efforts to pass such legislation in 2003 </p><p>would depend on the willingness of the National Republican </p><p>Front (FRG), which has a simple majority in Congress, to </p><p>support it.  That willingness is not assured -- the GOG and </p><p>FRG are smarting from the recent U.S. counter-narcotics </p><p>decertification decision. </p><p> </p><p>b)  Openness of legislature and government to work with </p><p>neighboring </p><p>governments, NGOs, and IOs to achieve harmony of anti-TIP </p><p>legislation: </p><p> </p><p>-- We believe the GOG and ruling FRG are open to regional </p><p>cooperation in this area with other governments and </p><p>international organizations.  In general, the </p><p>GOG has more hesitation working with regional NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>c)  Prospects for passage of an harmonized anti-TIP bill: </p><p> </p><p>-- Prospects for passage of legislation in 2003 is fair.  We </p><p>estimate that prospects for passage in the new Congress in </p><p>2004, with substantial USG lobbying and support, would be </p><p>good. </p><p> </p><p>d) impact of a legislative debate on TIP in Guatemala, </p><p>regardless of passage: </p><p> </p><p>-- Congressional debate would raise awareness among </p><p>legislators, but the issue could also be distorted (e.g. from </p><p>TIP to USG interference) by some for political considerations </p><p>related to the 2003 political campaign. </p><p>MCFARLAND </p><p></p></div>
