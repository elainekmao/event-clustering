(U) Background and summary: This cable is a wrap up of </p><p>the Frankfurt terrorism trial. It is based on observations </p><p>by U.S. officials at the trial, but is not to be taken as a </p><p>verbatim transcript of the proceedings.  When the written </p><p>verdict is published, post will provide it to Department. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Summary continued: Four Algerians and one Moroccan, </p><p>part of a group commonly referred to as the "Frankfurt cell" </p><p>or the "Meliani Group", were arrested in December 2000. </p><p>Bomb-making materials and weapons were found in their </p><p>Frankfurt apartments.  On March 10, 2003, four of the five </p><p>defendants were sentenced to 10-12 years of prison (the </p><p>possible maximum being 15) for plotting to bomb the </p><p>Christmas market in Strasbourg, France.  One defendant, </p><p>Busid Karimou, had his case severed from the rest of the </p><p>group.  He was charged with membership in a terrorist group </p><p>and was released from detention on August 30, 2002.  All the </p><p>defendants trained in camps in Afghanistan.  The trial </p><p>provided insight into the activities of a group of </p><p>terrorists, who trained in Afghanistan, and operated in </p><p>western Europe against a European target.  This cable </p><p>compiles what was learned during the trial about the </p><p>backgrounds of the terrorists and suspected terrorists, </p><p>their movements and operations, and their connections to </p><p>other terrorists in Europe.  End background and summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Defendants Trained in Afghanistan, But Court Could Not Prove </p><p>Al Qaeda Connection </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The group was arrested in December 2000 and their </p><p>trial began in Frankfurt on April 2002, at the Higher State </p><p>Court (Oberlandesgericht), convened by the Special Panel for </p><p>State Security Cases (Staatsschutzsenat).  Four of the five </p><p>defendants, Aerubi Beandali, Lamine Maroni, Fuhad Sabour and </p><p>Salim Boukhari, were charged with forming a terrorist </p><p>organization, planning an explosion, plotting to commit </p><p>murder, falsifying documents, and possession of weapons. </p><p>They were sentenced to 10-12 years in prison and have only a </p><p>week to appeal, although their basis for appeals under </p><p>German law is limited to procedural irregularities.  The </p><p>theoretical maximum sentence was 15 years.  A formal written </p><p>verdict is expected before the end of March. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Defendants Beandali, Boukhari and Karimou admitted </p><p>to training in terrorist camps in Afghanistan (Jalalabad, </p><p>Khost and Khaldan).  Boukhari also mentioned learning </p><p>electronics in Turkum, which he described as a "Kurdish </p><p>camp" (presumably in Turkum, Pakistan).  Sabour said he had </p><p>a year\'s training in "Islamic studies" in Afghanistan </p><p>(presumably also at a terrorist camp) where he met Beandali </p><p>and Boukhari.  A witness, Hassan Aknoush, said that Maroni </p><p>also trained with terrorists in Afghanistan.  The court </p><p>never successfully determined who planned or ordered the </p><p>attack, although Chief Judge Zeiher said it probably </p><p>originated with a man called Abu Doha in London.  Due to the </p><p>complications of getting witnesses from other countries, the </p><p>prosecution dropped the charge of "membership in a terrorist </p><p>organization" on January 15, 2003.  The prosecution </p><p>determined that proving the defendants were linked with </p><p>known terrorist organizations would have dragged out the </p><p>trial (it had already lasted nearly a year) without </p><p>increasing the severity of the ultimate sentences.  There </p><p>were some indications the group was affiliated with the </p><p>Algerian GSPC or Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, </p><p>and their Afghanistan training suggests an Al Qaeda </p><p>connection, but the court was unable to verify these </p><p>connections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Defendants: Multiple Aliases </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The following are the known names/aliases and dates </p><p>of birth of the defendants.  (Some variances in spelling </p><p>have been seen in different sources.) </p><p> </p><p>A. Aeurobui Beandali (also Deandali) DOB 12/10/1975; aka Ben </p><p>Ali; aka Mustapha Mestpha Kelouili DOB 11/19/1978; aka </p><p>Djilali Benali Correia DOB 7/15/1975; aka Djilali Adadi DOB </p><p>6/5/1975.  Presumed Algerian. </p><p> </p><p>B. Lamine Moroni, DOB 1/10/1970; aka Benard Pascale, DOB </p><p>7/25/1970. Presumed Algerian. </p><p> </p><p>C. Salim Boukhari (also Boukari), DOB 8/8/1971; aka Hicham </p><p>El-Haddad, DOB 4/30 1980; aka Claude Aman, DOB 8/8/1971; aka </p><p>Karim Muscat DOB 8/8/1971; aka Messaoud (also Mesud) Zamali </p><p>(also Zemani) DOB 8/4/1966; aka Mihdi; aka Malsara; aka </p><p>Kamal.

French or Algerian. </p><p> </p><p>E. Samir Karimou (also Krimou) aka Ibrahim Ahmed, DOB </p><p>12/18/1968; aka Abdel Kader. (Released from prison August </p><p>30, 2002, continued attending trial.) Born in Rabat, </p><p>Morocco. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Evidence: Bomb-Making Materials, Weapons, Forged </p><p>Passports, Videotape of Strasbourg Christmas Market </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The evidence presented in the case included a </p><p>surveillance videotape of the Strasbourg Christmas market </p><p>and surrounding area, the weapons and the bomb-making </p><p>materials found in the apartments, and police recordings of </p><p>defendants\' phone conversations.  Two apartments and a </p><p>rental car were searched by the Bundeskriminalamt or BKA </p><p>(similar to the FBI).  An apartment in Roederbergweg was </p><p>searched on December 23 and 26, 2000.  Another apartment on </p><p>Sigmund Freud Strasse was searched on December 25-26, 2000. </p><p>Items found included various passports and identification </p><p>papers (some of them fraudulent); weapons, including two </p><p>mini-machine pistols; 2 semi-automatic weapons; a revolver </p><p>and ammunition; a hand grenade; 20 kg of potassium </p><p>permanganate; various electrical components and wires; </p><p>chemicals and a detonator; batteries; acetone peroxide </p><p>(TATP); mobile phones; cannabis or hashish; nails; and cash </p><p>in various currencies (German marks, British pounds, French </p><p>francs.)  (Note: the cannabis or hashish was apparently seen </p><p>on the initial search on December 23, 2000, but were missing </p><p>when the items were seized on December 26.)  Various notes </p><p>and letters were also found.  Forged passports were also </p><p>found in one of the defendant\'s rental cars.  Defendant </p><p>Beandali stated the weapons were eventually to be shipped to </p><p>Algeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Defendants, Background, Statements, Observations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>Defendant, Aeurobui Beandali: The Bomb Builder </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Aeurobui Beandali was the first of the defendants </p><p>to testify before the court.  Beandali expressed regret for </p><p>his actions, stating that the events of September 11 had </p><p>changed his views on terrorism as a means of political </p><p>change.  Of the five defendants, Beandali seems to have been </p><p>in Germany the longest but had the strongest connection to </p><p>Algeria.  He said his original motivation was anger over </p><p>human rights abuses committed by the Algerian military </p><p>government.  Beandali said he has been a member of the </p><p>Islamic Salvation Front political party (outlawed in 1992). </p><p>Beandali fled Algeria in 1992 at the age of 16 and applied </p><p>for political asylum in Germany.  After committing several </p><p>criminal offences, including theft and aggravated assault, </p><p>Beandali\'s German asylum application was rejected and he was </p><p>ordered deported in April 1992.  He went into hiding to </p><p>avoid deportation, supporting himself by petty crime and </p><p>drug trafficking.  He also spent some time in France, </p><p>although the dates are unclear, where he apparently also </p><p>committed robbery and drug-related crimes. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Beandali gave contradictory statements about his </p><p>whereabouts in 1999-2000.  In one statement he said from </p><p>March 1999 until spring 2000 he lived in an apartment on </p><p>Leonardsgasse 7 in Frankfurt.  In another, he claimed he </p><p>went to Afghanistan from about November 1999 - August 2000. </p><p>Beandali said he paid his own way to train in a camp in </p><p>Afghanistan, spending about $15,000 of his own money. </p><p>Beandali claimed he had to pay for his own ammunition - $150 </p><p>for 750 rounds of ammunition.  He described his training in </p><p>Afghanistan as specializing in religion, light weapons, </p><p>heavy weapons and explosives.  Beandali said he met another </p><p>defendant, Karimou, at a camp near the Afghan town of </p><p>Khaldan, although Karimou stated he met Beandali in Khost. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Beandali said he was an expert in explosives and </p><p>that it was his job to buy the bomb-building materials for </p><p>the Frankfurt cell. He explained that the bomb was to be </p><p>placed in a large, aluminum, Pakistani steam pot, which he </p><p>ordered in London.  (Note: The fact that this would have </p><p>produced deadly splinter fragments was used as evidence that </p><p>the targets were people and not an empty synagogue as the </p><p>other defendants claimed.  End Note.)  He also bought large </p><p>amounts of potassium permanganate.  Found among the evidence </p><p>seized in the Frankfurt apartment was a letter, purportedly </p><p>from a company, attempting to place an order for 115 </p><p>kilograms of potassium permanganate.  Beandali admitted that </p><p>he and Boukhari had written the letter using a fabricated </p><p>company name and person (Barakhat).  Given the large amount </p><p>of potassium permanganate, the prosecutors asked if the </p><p>group planned multiple attacks.  Beandali stated that </p><p>several attacks in Algeria were planned after Strasbourg, </p><p>hence the large amount of bomb materials. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The BKA testified on what was found in Beandali\'s </p><p>rental car, which was in very bad shape.  Found inside were </p><p>a backpack, several false passports, various papers and </p><p>passport photos.  One of the passports was connected with </p><p>Aknoush and Aknoush\'s fingerprints were found on the </p><p>backpack.  (Note: Aknoush, an associate of the Frankfurt </p><p>cell, is in custody in France.)  They also found a mobile </p><p>phone, whose number matched with one being monitored by the </p><p>BKA. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Despite Beandali\'s sometimes contradictory </p><p>statements and previous criminal record, he was actually the </p><p>most open with the court, helped moved the proceedings </p><p>along, and expressed regret for his actions and a desire to </p><p>turn away from Islamic extremism.  He received the lightest </p><p>sentence, ten years, due to his cooperation with the court. </p><p>Beandali accepted the sentence and said he would not appeal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Defendant, Lamine Maroni: The Disruptive, Absurd One </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Beandali had stated that Lamine Maroni\'s only job </p><p>was to help him mix the chemicals to make explosives and </p><p>that he was not involved in planning the attack.  Maroni did </p><p>not formally testify but confirmed some statements by </p><p>defendant Sabour.  Maroni said Beandali was the leader of </p><p>the Frankfurt cell and he openly displayed hostility to </p><p>Beandali.  Maroni\'s role in the group was unclear, but the </p><p>other defendants seemed to be a bit afraid of him.  Maroni </p><p>seems to have been in England before coming to Frankfurt </p><p>with Boukhari sometime in late 2000.  Maroni did not </p><p>cooperated with his lawyers, then complained he was </p><p>uninformed.  A witness, Hassan Aknoush, has stated that </p><p>Maroni also trained with terrorists in Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Maroni was disruptive from the start.  On the </p><p>first day of the trial he shouted, "Everyone here is a Jew!" </p><p>He said that non-believers are dirt, that he did not want a </p><p>lawyer, and that he only had contact with God.  He continued </p><p>to disrupt proceedings on subsequent trial days and was </p><p>absent for the fourth trial session on May 7, 2002, after </p><p>being found in prison with a razor blade which he used to </p><p>cut up his clothing.  He later rejoined the trial, having </p><p>missed several sessions.  Maroni enjoyed engaging in </p><p>distracting behavior, especially when it seemed sensitive </p><p>information was about to be revealed by a defendant or </p><p>witness.  He yelled out things to the other defendants such </p><p>as, "Sometimes they lie to you to get you talking."  He </p><p>demanded sandwiches, chocolate, made absurd statements, </p><p>criticized the judges and prosecuting attorneys, and </p><p>complained loudly about his handcuffs. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Maroni received a sentence of eleven years, one </p><p>year higher than the prosecution had requested, for his lack </p><p>of cooperation and repeated hostile statements.  His </p><p>outbursts demonstrated his hatred and ruthlessness, the </p><p>court concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Defendant Salim Boukhari: The London Connection </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) The defendant Salim Boukhari appears to have had </p><p>the strongest connections to London. The Algerian Embassy </p><p>questioned him on October 30, 2002 with his lawyers present. </p><p>The Algerian Embassy confirmed that Boukhari was Algerian, </p><p>but cast doubt on the accuracy of the name and Algerian </p><p>address he had given.  When Judge Zeiher read Boukhari\'s </p><p>Algerian address from a letter Boukhari had written (50 </p><p>Boulevard Mohammed V, Algiers, 1016 Algeria), Boukhari </p><p>declined to confirm it, but asked the judge not to reveal it </p><p>to the Algerian Embassy, apparently afraid the Algerian </p><p>government might harm his family.  The judge responded that </p><p>the address was not a secret. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) According to his own statement, Boukhari wanted to </p><p>study in France but failed to get a residence permit.  He </p><p>went to London but was deported, though the dates are </p><p>unclear.  Somehow he returned, and according to his own </p><p>statements, lived in London starting from about 1995.  He </p><p>married Tina Nash and lived with her at 79 Blesbury Road in </p><p>London.  He worked for a security company called Mitas </p><p>Security and then later moved to the Layton Stone district. </p><p>He met a man named Noureddine in 1995, who got him </p><p>interested in religion.  After Boukhari\'s divorce in 1998, </p><p>he moved in with Noureddine, who recruited him for Islamic </p><p>causes, showing him videos of Algeria, Chechnya and </p><p>Palestine.  Boukhari said he thought of donating money to </p><p>the Algerian freedom struggle but instead used his life </p><p>savings of 3000 British pounds to go to Afghanistan via </p><p>Pakistan. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) He arrived in Peshawar in early 2000.  He was </p><p>welcomed by Hassan Aknoush and other Algerians, including a </p><p>man named Jaffa.  Boukhari trained for five months in </p><p>Afghanistan in light and heavy weapons, electronics and </p><p>religion.  He became ill with malaria and typhoid fever and </p><p>returned to Pakistan where he stayed with Jaffa.  In </p><p>Pakistan, Boukhari got to know Beandali.  When Jaffa was </p><p>forced to flee, pursued by Pakistani intelligence services, </p><p>Boukhari obtained a forged British passport and returned to </p><p>London on September 16, 2000.  He remarried in October 2000 </p><p>and had a son on June 19, 2001.  He met Noureddine again, </p><p>who asked him if he was willing to go to Frankfurt to pick </p><p>up some weapons from Aknoush.  Boukhari went to Frankfurt in </p><p>early November 2000 for a few days.  Later in November 2000, </p><p>he returned to Frankfurt, accompanied by Maroni, and stayed </p><p>with Beandali. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) Boukhari\'s statements to the court were often </p><p>confusing and inconsistent.  Regarding his involvement in </p><p>the attack in Strasbourg, Boukhari said that the planning </p><p>began in early December 2000, and claimed he agreed to </p><p>participate if no one would be hurt.  He also claimed he </p><p>intended to return to London in December 2000, and therefore </p><p>would not be present at the time of the attack.  Boukhari </p><p>admits he was the point of contact for Nourredine in London. </p><p>Boukhari claims, however, that Nourreddine did not give </p><p>orders or designate a target but gave "only ideas." </p><p>Boukhari admitted buying chemicals at different locations in </p><p>Germany with the help of Sabour.  Boukhari also admitted </p><p>making the comment on the surveillance videotape of the </p><p>Strasbourg Christmas market, "These are the enemies of God. </p><p>They dance and are happy, God willing they will stew in </p><p>hell." </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) Aknoush stated that Boukhari was in contact with </p><p>Abu Doha in London.  Boukhari said he had spoken with Abu </p><p>Doha but only on the subject of renting rooms in Baden </p><p>Baden.  Aknoush, in a statement from detention in France, </p><p>also said that Boukhari was the assigned leader of the </p><p>Frankfurt cell.  Boukhari stated that the attack was planned </p><p>for the end of January or beginning of February 2001, </p><p>perhaps, again to distract from the Christmas market as </p><p>target and the charge of attempted murder. </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) Boukhari received the longest sentence of the four </p><p>defendants, twelve years in prison.  Judge Zeiher concluded </p><p>he was the "driving force" behind the Frankfurt cell who </p><p>obtained money for the operation, purchased the largest </p><p>amount of bomb-making materials, and handled logistics.  He </p><p>cooperated only reluctantly with the court, and frequently </p><p>expressed hatred of Jews and western culture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Defendant, Fouhad Sabour </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) Fouhad Sabour said that he became involved with </p><p>Islamic extremists in London in 1995.  In 1996, he was </p><p>arrested in France for membership in a terrorist </p><p>organization.  He admitted being a member of Algeria\'s GIA </p><p>or Armed Islamic Front.  He said that he spent a year in </p><p>Afghanistan (May 1999 - May 2000) for "Islamic legal </p><p>studies."  (Note: Presumably, Sabour was also at a terrorist </p><p>training camp, though he did not specify where.)  There he </p><p>met Beandali and Boukhari.  It is not clear when Sabour came </p><p>to Germany, but he said he met and moved in with Maroni in </p><p>the Sigmund Freud Strasse apartment in Frankfurt.  Sabour </p><p>admitted possessing three fraudulent passports and other </p><p>forged documents and using aliases. </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) Sabour\'s role in the plot was unclear.  Boukhari, </p><p>in his statements, denied that Sabour had any detailed </p><p>knowledge of the bombing plans.  It seems Sabour was </p><p>assigned some duties (specifics unclear) to help in carrying </p><p>out the attack together with Boukhari or Beandali.  Boukhari </p><p>said he and Sabour bought chemicals at different locations </p><p>in Germany.  Sabour also admitted driving the car to </p><p>Strasbourg, accompanying Boukhari to videotape the target. </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU) Sabour received the second highest sentence of </p><p>eleven and a half years.  The judges agreed with the </p><p>prosecution that Sabour\'s participation in videotaping the </p><p>Christmas market made him a willing accomplice in the </p><p>attack. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Defendant, Busid Karimou </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU) Busid Karimou was released from detention on </p><p>August 30, 2002.  The court could not find any evidence he </p><p>was involved in the preparations for the bomb attack, thus </p><p>he was only charged with membership in a criminal group, </p><p>which carries a one-to-ten year sentence.  The judge ordered </p><p>Karimou released from custody after he was incarcerated for </p><p>17 months, noting that continued detention was unreasonable, </p><p>considering that a prisoner can be eligible for an early </p><p>release, based on good behavior, after having served two </p><p>thirds of the sentence.  The judge noted that Karimou had </p><p>lied repeatedly, given a false name, and at first denied </p><p>that he had trained in Afghanistan, and thus was not </p><p>innocent. </p><p> </p><p>25. (SBU) According to his own statement, Karimou was born </p><p>in Rabat, Morocco.  He moved to Algeria, then to Germany in </p><p>February 1999.  He applied for asylum in Germany on February </p><p>23, 1999 and fell in with hashish dealers while the decision </p><p>was pending.  He felt he was being pursued by police and </p><p>fled to London, where he hoped to get a job and a residence </p><p>permit.  He began visiting the Finsbury Park mosque in </p><p>London and became interested in religion and politics.  In </p><p>January 2000, he joined a Tunisian friend named Amar and </p><p>went to Afghanistan for training.  First he stayed with </p><p>Jaffa in Peshawar, then went to a camp in Jalalabad.  There </p><p>he met Boukhari, who had just ended his training.  He was </p><p>required to turn in his forged French passport.  He met </p><p>Beandali at a second camp in Khost.  The training was harder </p><p>than he expected; Karimou said he argued constantly with his </p><p>group leader and the other participants.  After only three </p><p>months of training, he returned to Pakistan, where Jaffa </p><p>accused him of being a traitor.  Karimou said he got his </p><p>forged French passport back only after repeated attempts. </p><p> </p><p>26. (SBU) Karimou returned to London in May 2000 and met an </p><p>old friend from Frankfurt, Abdel Hadid.  Unable to find a </p><p>job in London, Karimou moved to Frankfurt in July 2000.  At </p><p>first he had no place to stay, but then managed to throw </p><p>Aknoush out of his apartment in Sporstrasse 61.  (The </p><p>landlord was angry because Aknoush had not paid his rent.) </p><p>Apparently this apartment was used as a meeting point for </p><p>the group, and Beandali and Boukhari were frequent visitors. </p><p>Karimou said he had no knowledge of the Strasbourg attack </p><p>and was never a member of the group.  Beandali, in his </p><p>statement, also said Karimou was innocent and not involved </p><p>in the plot but only arrested because they were friends. </p><p>According to Beandali, Karimou was merely in the wrong place </p><p>at the wrong time when arrests were made. </p><p> </p><p>Witnesses, Contacts and Others Connected to the Frankfurt </p><p>Cell </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>27. (SBU) Mohammed Afane, witness. Born in Algeria, age 26, </p><p>arrived in Frankfurt in April 2000 after transiting Spain </p><p>and France.  Afane said he had met Karimou in Frankfurt, and </p><p>knew Karimou\'s brothers in Algeria.  Afane also testified </p><p>that he met Boukhari (known to him as Hitscham) in </p><p>Weiterstadt prison near Darmstadt.  Boukhari asked Afane to </p><p>take a letter for him, which Afane declined to do after </p><p>reading it.  He said the letter mentioned "saving money for </p><p>weapons to support our friends" and a man named Suleiman who </p><p>was not arrested and "hopefully could make it before he also </p><p>gets arrested."  Afane assumed Suleiman was a dangerous </p><p>terrorist.  (Note: Suleiman may be Slimane Khalfaoui or </p><p>Slimane Mutamna, see below.) </p><p> </p><p>28. (SBU) Hassan Aknoush (aka Jassin; aka Moheme; aka </p><p>Aknouche), witness.  In detention in France.  He apparently </p><p>met Boukhari in Pakistan.  Aknoush\'s written statements were </p><p>read by the Frankfurt court.  A backpack with Aknoush\'s </p><p>fingerprints was found in Beandali\'s rental car.  Beandali </p><p>has stated that the weapons seized in the Frankfurt </p><p>apartment belonged to Aknoush, although Beandali denied </p><p>Aknoush was connected to the bomb plot.  Beandali said he </p><p>had known Aknoush since 1999.  Aknoush said, in statements </p><p>to French authorities cited by the court in Frankfurt, that </p><p>Abu Doha was the head of the Frankfurt cell and Boukhari was </p><p>his closest contact.  Aknoush said that according to a phone </p><p>call he had with Abu Doha, Abu Doha "picked Boukhari to be </p><p>in charge of the attack in Strasbourg."  Aknoush stated, as </p><p>reported in French police documents, that Boukhari and </p><p>Maroni underwent training with Abu Kahba, an expert in bombs </p><p>and chemical weapons connected to Al Qaeda, in Afganistan. </p><p> </p><p>29. (SBU) Abu Doha (aka Dr. Rashid), contact.  Suspected </p><p>Algerian terrorist leader, in custody in England awaiting </p><p>extradition to the United States based on his connection </p><p>with the plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport </p><p>during the Millenium.  He has been described by the media as </p><p>the man who supervised Algerian terrorists in Europe once </p><p>they had finished their training in Afghanistan.  Abu Doha </p><p>was a contact of Boukhari\'s in London.  His role in the </p><p>planned Strasbourg attack is unclear.  Defendant Beandali </p><p>has denied Abu Doha was the leader of the Frankfurt cell. </p><p>Defendant Boukhari has admitted to telephone conversations </p><p>with Abu Doha, but said he has never met him.  Boukhari </p><p>stated that Abu Doha had instructed the Frankfurt cell, </p><p>presumably in December 2000, to rent another apartment "for </p><p>a longer time," but Boukhari said that Abu Doha had nothing </p><p>to do with the Strasbourg attack and was not the leader of </p><p>the Frankfurt cell.  However, according to the BKA, British </p><p>intelligence reported a telephone conversation between </p><p>Boukhari (in Frankfurt) and Abu Doha (in London) on December </p><p>24, 2000 in which the attack was discussed and Boukhari asks </p><p>Abu Doha for more money for the rooms rented in Frankfurt. </p><p> </p><p>30. (SBU) Mohammed Sadikki (aka Mohammed Bitchu), witness. </p><p>Got to know Maroni and Beandali in two German prisons. </p><p>Sadikki provided the most extensive testimony of any </p><p>witness.  According to Sadikki, Maroni admitted to </p><p>participation in a number of terrorist operations in the </p><p>U.K.  Sadikki said Beandali asked him to deliver a message </p><p>to a mosque in Frankfurt and talked of the need to fight </p><p>Christians and Jews.  Beandali mentioned a synagogue in </p><p>Lille, France as a potential target.  Beandali also told </p><p>Sadikki the group planned further attacks in Germany, France </p><p>and Spain.  Beandali never mentioned the Strasbourg </p><p>Christmas market to Sadikki, but Beandali said he would like </p><p>to turn Rome, the cradle of Christianity, into ashes. </p><p>Sadikki verified Beandali\'s role as bomb expert and </p><p>indicated that Beandali and other members of the group </p><p>coordinated their testimonies in prison before the trial </p><p>started. </p><p> </p><p>31. (SBU) Sadikki mentioned Usama bin Laden twice.  Sadikki </p><p>reported that Beandali asked him to contact a man named </p><p>Abdul Rachman in London after his release.  Beandali </p><p>described Rachman as "Usama bin Laden\'s representative" in </p><p>London, who had also promised to take hostages to force the </p><p>release of the members of the Frankfurt cell.  Sadikki also </p><p>testified that Beandali told him that the camp in </p><p>Afghanistan at which he was trained was run by Usama bin </p><p>Laden.  Sadikki also said that the group used forged </p><p>documents and stolen credit cards. Sadikki\'s testimony was </p><p>sharply challenged by Beandali\'s attorney.  Sadikki also did </p><p>not always strike observers as a credible witness since much </p><p>of his testimony consisted of merely confirming statements </p><p>he had given earlier to the police.  He also seemed to be </p><p>exaggerating at times.  For example, at one point, he said </p><p>the Frankfurt cell had 38 million German marks at their </p><p>disposal, which caused the defendants to laugh. </p><p> </p><p>32. (SBU) Slimane Khalfaoui, (aka Azzedine; aka Slimane </p><p>Amena; aka Sedine; aka "Tourist"), contact.  Was arrested in </p><p>an eastern suburb of Paris, France on November 25, 2002 in </p><p>connection with the Strasbourg bombing plot.  Slimane </p><p>Khalfaoui is described by a New York Times report as "an </p><p>important member of the Al Qaeda network in Europe," a 27- </p><p>year-old with French-Algerian nationality, who fought in </p><p>Bosnia and Afghanistan and has been on wanted lists since </p><p>1996.  Beandali admitted knowing Slimane Khalfaoui.  The </p><p>police have a recording of a phone conversation between </p><p>Slimani Kalfaoui and Beandali from December 25, 2000.  They </p><p>discussed the whereabouts of Noureddine and Slimane </p><p>Kalfaoui\'s expected arrival in Frankfurt.  Slimane Khalfaoui </p><p>may have lived in Lyon for a time, providing the Frankfurt </p><p>cell with information on Jewish communities.  Beandali </p><p>stated that Slimane Khalfaoui "sometimes resided in Germany, </p><p>but also in France and Britain." </p><p> </p><p>33. (SBU) Abdul Rachman, alleged contact.  Described by the </p><p>witness Sadikki (see above) as "Usama bin Laden\'s </p><p>representative" in London, who had also promised to take </p><p>hostages to force the release of the members of the </p><p>Frankfurt cell.  Sadikki, in his testimony, stated that </p><p>defendant Beandali had asked Sadikki to contact a man named </p><p>Abdul Rachman in London after Sadikki\'s release. </p><p> </p><p>34. (SBU) Meliani, aka Mohamed Bensakhiria, alleged contact. </p><p>Currently in French custody.  According to an Italian police </p><p>report filed with a court in Milan, the Frankfurt cell is </p><p>connected to Mohamed Bensakhiria in Italy.  Meliani has also </p><p>been described as a leader of the Frankfurt cell and the BKA </p><p>has investigated other Meliani contacts in Berlin.  The </p><p>Frankfurt cell\'s connection to Meliani was never pursued by </p><p>the Frankfurt court. </p><p> </p><p>35. (SBU) Lazahr ben Mohamad Tlilli, alleged contact.  A 33- </p><p>year old Tunisian man was arrested in Marseille in mid- </p><p>October 2000.  According to the media, Lazahr ben Mohamad </p><p>Tlilli was in possession of false documents and telephone </p><p>numbers of people suspected of terrorist involvement in </p><p>Italy, Germany, Belgium, England and France.  Lazahr ben </p><p>Mohamad Tlilli is alleged to have connections with at least </p><p>one member of the Frankfurt cell.  The Frankfurt court did </p><p>not pursue this connection. </p><p> </p><p>36. (SBU) Mounir Shuhaib, contact.  Another suspected </p><p>terrorist and alias of the person who rented the apartment </p><p>in Sigmund Freud Strasse according to BKA testimony. </p><p> </p><p>37. (SBU) Hassan Atap, contact.  According to Beandali, he </p><p>is an opposition leader in Algeria and was his contact for </p><p>planning attacks in Algeria. </p><p> </p><p>38. (SBU) Jaffa, contact. For a time based in Peshawar, </p><p>described by Boukhari as a member of the Takfiri group, more </p><p>extremist than the Taliban.  Karimou also mentioned Jaffa in </p><p>Peshawar.  Karimou said Jaffa accused him of being a traitor </p><p>when Karimou gave up after only three months of training in </p><p>Afghanistan.  Jaffa was reluctant to return to Karimou his </p><p>forged French passport.  (Note: Perhaps this is the Abu </p><p>Jaffar mentioned by Ahmed Ressam, the millennium bomber in </p><p>his 2001 testimony, as "in charge of the Algerian cells" </p><p>training in Afghanistan.  Abu Jaffar was also described by </p><p>Ressam as being a camp leader, and training recruits in the </p><p>use of TNT and C4 explosives.) </p><p> </p><p>39. (SBU) Djoumakh, alleged contact.  In detention in </p><p>France, presumed Algerian.  Mentioned in the November 23, </p><p>2002 trial session by Judge Zeiher as a friend of Slimane </p><p>Mutamna.  Prosecutor Brinkmann said that Djoumakh had </p><p>testified on contacts Maroni, Boukhari and Sabour had with </p><p>Abu Doha and Slimane Mutamna in London. </p><p> </p><p>40. (SBU) Salime (also Slimane) Mutamna, contact.  Boukhari </p><p>said he, Salime Mutamna and Sabour were all together in </p><p>Frankfurt in November 2000, where they attempted to purchase </p><p>weapons for Algeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Motivation, Connection to Al Qaeda? </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>41. (SBU) The defendants gave various and contradictory </p><p>explanations of their motivation for a terrorist attack. </p><p>Beandali, the most active in Algerian causes, claimed anger </p><p>at human rights abuses in Algeria or "fighting the dangerous </p><p>regime" in Algeria a motivation.  Beandali stated the </p><p>weapons seized by authorities were intended for Algeria. </p><p>Boukhari and Sabour also cited solidarity with the "struggle </p><p>of the Palestinian people" as a reason.  A desire to disrupt </p><p>relations between France and Israel was also mentioned.  All </p><p>defendants seem to share a general hatred of Jews and </p><p>Christians as shown in statements such as, "Non-believers </p><p>don\'t deserve to breathe.  They are the enemies of God...." </p><p>The court did not establish any clear motivation for the </p><p>attack by the Frankfurt cell -- or any of its members -- or </p><p>why Strasbourg in particular was selected as a target, </p><p>though clearly the Strasbourg cathedral and market are </p><p>heavily symbolic.  The defendants have given contradictory </p><p>statements about whose idea the attack was.  Sabour stated </p><p>it was the idea of the Frankfurt cell alone, while Beandali </p><p>said that Boukhari received orders for the attack from </p><p>London.  Defendants are vigorous in denying any connection </p><p>to Al Qaeda, though their training in Afghanistan camps and </p><p>contact with other known Al Qaeda network members make this </p><p>claim somewhat doubtful.  The court abandoned attempts to </p><p>prove an Al Qaeda connection by dropping membership in a </p><p>terrorit organization charges in January, 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What was the London Connection?  What was the role of Abu </p><p>Doha and Noureddine? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>42. (SBU) Abu Doha: The London connection to the Frankfurt </p><p>cell is unclear.  According to the BKA, British intelligence </p><p>reported a phone call between Boukhari (in Frankfurt) and </p><p>Abu Doha (in London) on December 24, 2000, in which a </p><p>terrorist attack is discussed and Boukhari asks Abu Doha for </p><p>more German money to pay for two rooms rented in Frankfurt. </p><p>Boukhari admitted to having phone conversations with Abu </p><p>Doha, but denied Abu Doha was the leader of the group. The </p><p>criminal complaint filed in the Southern District of New </p><p>York alleges that Abu Doha facilitated the travel of </p><p>trainees into Al-Qaeda-affiliated training camps and was </p><p>responsible for establishing communication among various </p><p>cells in the training camps (see par. 8).  In addition, in </p><p>press statements, the prosecutors described Abu Doha as a </p><p>key figure in Al Qaeda. </p><p> </p><p>43. (SBU) Noureddine (never further identified), Beandali\'s </p><p>View: Noureddine was another London contact frequently </p><p>mentioned.  Beandali said he distrusted Noureddine.  He said </p><p>he met him in Afghanistan and noted he did not follow </p><p>Islamic washing rites.  He described Noureddine as an </p><p>Algerian with a French passport living in London.  He stated </p><p>that Noureddine was an undercover agent of French </p><p>intelligence and that Noureddine had told Beandali that the </p><p>French secret service had offered him money to inform on </p><p>Algerians living in London and Afghanistan.  Beandali also </p><p>heard from a man known as "the Emir" that Noureddine was an </p><p>informer.  Beandali also said that Noureddine was flown out </p><p>of the Balkans by the French government.  Noureddine was </p><p>also interested in a man named Hisham, whom Beandali claimed </p><p>was wanted by the FBI.  Beandali said he helped Hisham </p><p>escape from Afghanistan to London, then to Germany and </p><p>Spain.  Eventually, Hisham was arrested in Algeria and </p><p>Beandali believes Noureddine turned Hisham into the </p><p>authorities.  Thus for several reasons, Beandali felt </p><p>Noureddine was an informer.  In a somewhat contradictory </p><p>statement, however, Beandali suspected Noureddine of </p><p>directing the attack in Strasbourg (Comment: This seems </p><p>strange for a French intelligence agent.  End comment) and </p><p>giving orders to Boukhari from London.  Beandali told Judge </p><p>Zeiher, when he "heard Noureddine in London was behind the </p><p>plan," he "found it unlikely that the target was an empty </p><p>building.  A guy like Noureddine certainly had something </p><p>more spectacular in mind, something where people could be </p><p>hurt." </p><p> </p><p>44. (SBU) Noureddine, Boukhari\'s View: In contrast, Boukhari </p><p>appears to have been a rather close friend of Noureddine. </p><p>Boukhari stayed with Noureddine at his London apartment at </p><p>various times and between his marriages.  Noureddine </p><p>apparently nudged Boukhari in the direction of Islamic </p><p>extremism, inspiring him to train in Afghanistan.  Boukhari </p><p>also said that the Frankfurt cell had 20,000 German marks at </p><p>their disposal, which Noureddine had brought from London. </p><p>Boukhari has been vague about Noureddine\'s role in the </p><p>Strasbourg attack, but has stated that Noureddine only gave </p><p>"ideas, not orders." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSIONS AND COMMENT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>45. (SBU) The defendants, all of Algerian or Moroccan </p><p>origin, spent time in western Europe (especially France, </p><p>England and Germany), and were involved in terrorist and/or </p><p>criminal activity for several years.  They moved easily in </p><p>and out of Germany and around western Europe.  Four of the </p><p>five (all but Maroni) have admitted to training in </p><p>Afghanistan.  Three of the five (Beandali, Boukhari, </p><p>Karimou) admitted to training in terrorist camps there.  A </p><p>witness, Hassan Aknoush, has stated that Maroni also trained </p><p>with terrorists in Afghanistan.  Thus if Aknoush is correct, </p><p>all five defendants trained in Afghanistan.  The Frankfurt </p><p>cell was planning some type of bomb attack in Strasbourg and </p><p>had gathered significant bomb-making materials for the job. </p><p>The Frankfurt cell had definite connections to others </p><p>assumed to be terrorists or Islamic extremists in England </p><p>and France.  Although the court could not prove an Al Qaeda </p><p>connection, defendants admitted contact with Slimane </p><p>Khalfaoui (in France, alleged member of Al Qaeda network), </p><p>Abu Doha (in London, alleged member of Al Qaeda network); </p><p>and Noureddine (in London, affiliation unknown.)  In reading </p><p>the sentences, Judge Zeiher said that the arrest of the </p><p>defendants had "prevented a bloodbath." </p><p> </p><p>46.
