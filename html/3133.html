REASONS 1.5(B,D </p><p>). </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) SUMMARY: PLANS ARE AFOOT FOR TAIWAN PRESIDENT CHEN TO </p><p>TRANSIT ITALY THIS JULY ON TRAVEL FROM TAIPEI TO AFRICA, </p><p>ACCORDING TO TAIWAN EMBOFF, YET THE VATICAN IS NOT PUTTING </p><p>OUT THE RED CARPET.  TAIWAN FM EUGENE Y.H. CHIEN MET MAY 30 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02901  140953Z </p><p>WITH VATICAN FM ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN, YET REACHED NO </p><p>AGREEMENT ON VATICAN MEETINGS FOR PRESIDENT CHEN. BEHIND </p><p>CLOSED DOORS, THE VATICAN PROTESTED TAIWAN DOMESTIC POLICIES </p><p>THAT IT BELIEVES BLOCK CHURCH EXPANSION. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)TAIWAN EMBOFF PETER TING TOLD POLOFF JUNE 5 THAT TAIWAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER EUGENE Y.H. CHIEN\'S MAY 30 MEETING WITH </p><p>VATICAN FM JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN BROUGHT WHAT HE CALLED THORNY </p><p>BILATERAL ISSUES TO THE FORE.  FM TAURAN LODGED A COMPLAINT </p><p>ABOUT TAIPEI\'S DELISTING OF DECEMBER 25 AS A TAIWAN NATIONAL </p><p>HOLIDAY (PREVIOUSLY JUSTIFIED TO COMMEMORATE THE PROMULGATION </p><p>OF THE 1936 CONSTITUTION.)  TAURAN FURTHER PROTESTED TAIPEI </p><p>ZONING LAWS WHICH, THE VATICAN CLAIMS, IMPEDE CONSTRUCTION OF </p><p>NEW SEMINARIES. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE WAS NO VATICAN </p><p>AGREEMENT FOR MEETINGS WITH TAIWAN PRESIDENT CHEN SHUI-BIAN </p><p>SHOULD HE TRANSIT ITALY IN JULY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) TAIWAN PRESIDENT CHEN IS TENTATIVELY PLANNING A VISIT </p><p>TO AFRICA IN JULY THAT WOULD INCLUDE TRANSIT TRAVEL THROUGH </p><p>INDIA AND ITALY, ACCORDING TO TAIWAN EMBOFF.  TAIWAN, WHICH </p><p>ENJOYS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE VATICAN, WOULD NORMALLY </p><p>SEEK A VISIT, YET THE VATICAN, TING SAID, HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>ENCOURAGING.  CONSEQUENTLY, TAIWAN WAS NOW THINKING IN TERMS </p><p>OF AN OVERNIGHT AIRPORT STOP AT MILAN AND A PRIVATE DINNER, </p><p>POSSIBLY WITH PROMINENT VATICAN OR GOI LEADERS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>TING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  TAIWAN FM CHIEN ALSO SAW FORMER VATICAN </p><p>DFM ARCHBISHOP CLAUDIO CELLI.  CELLI, WHO AS DFM REACHED A </p><p>BREAKTHROUGH AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM ON RELIGIOUS PRACTICE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02901  140953Z </p><p>NOW HAS PRINCIPAL OVERSIGHT OF PRC-VATICAN DIALOG. TING SAID </p><p>CHIEN AND CELLI DISCUSSED THE STATUS OF VATICAN-PRC DIALOG -- </p><p>STALLED UNTIL THE PRC RESOLVES SUCCESSION OF PARTY LEADERSHIP </p><p>-- AND LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR VATICAN-TAIWAN RELATIONS. </p><p>SINCE 1999 VARIOUS VATICAN OFFICIALS HAVE VOCALLY REITERATED </p><p>THE STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE (PRIME </p><p>MINISTER-EQUIVALENT) CARDINAL SODANO THAT THE VATICAN IS </p><p>READY TO DOWNGRADE TIES WITH TAIPEI OVERNIGHT IF BEIJING </p><p>AGREES TO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  TING </p><p>ADMITTED TAIWAN INCREASINGLY VIEWED THIS VATICAN STANCE WAS </p><p>INSULTING, A MARKED DEPARTURE FROM THE GENERALLY CAUTIOUS AND </p><p>POSITIVE COMMENTARY THAT HIS MISSION RESERVES FOR THE </p><p>VATICAN, THE SOLE GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE TO RECOGNIZE TAIWAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  TAIWAN LATELY HAS BEEN TESTING THE LIMITS OF </p><p>ITS VATICAN FRIENDSHIP AS WELL AS OF THE LATERAN ACCORDS, THE </p><p>ITALIAN-VATICAN AGREEMENT THAT INTER ALIA REQUIRES ITALY </p><p>GRANT TRANSIT VISAS FOR FOREIGN OFFICIALS ON VATICAN VISITS. </p><p>TAIWAN VP ANNETTE LU SWUNG THROUGH THE  VATICAN IN MARCH FOR </p><p>WHAT THE VATICAN\'S CHINA DESK OFFICER, MSGR. ROTA-GRAZIOSI, </p><p>DISMISSED AS A MEANINGLESS CEREMONIAL MEETING WITH FM TAURAN. </p><p> FM CHIEN\'S MEETINGS ARE A PRELUDE TO AN ATTEMPTED </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL VISIT THAT THE VATICAN IS UNLIKELY TO GRANT. </p><p>THE VATICAN IS SUPPORTIVE OF ITS TAIWAN FRIENDS, YET WILL NOT </p><p>BE PARTY TO GRATUITOUS PROVOCATIONS OF THE PRC, PARTICULARLY </p><p>AMID THE RUN-UP TO THE PRC PARTY CONGRESS THIS FALL AND THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S EVIDENT HOPE TO KICK-START DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>SOON THEREAFTER. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02901  140953Z </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
