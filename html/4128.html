(U) This cable contains business-sensitive information and </p><p>should be handled accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Summary </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary. On October 25, the Ambassador and USAID </p><p>Director met with Nepal\'s newly appointed Finance Minister. </p><p>The Finance Minister articulated the immediate priorities of </p><p>his Ministry and highlighted the broader mandate of the </p><p>interim government to deliver services and hold elections. He </p><p>expressed eager support for USAID\'s first Conflict Mitigation </p><p>Program project, the completion of a rural road in the western </p><p>hills through quick-dispersing payments for local labor. The </p><p>Finance Minister also requested assistance from the USG on </p><p>providing breathing space to Nepal\'s textile exporters leading </p><p>up to the elimination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Establishing Priorities </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) the Ambassador, accompanied by USAID Director, Joanne </p><p>Hale and ECONOFF, met with Badri Prasad Shrestha, the newly </p><p>appointed Finance Minster, on October 25. The Finance Minister </p><p>explained that the primary goals of the interim cabinet are to </p><p>deliver effective government services, establish peace, and </p><p>hold elections. The Finance Minister explained the need to </p><p>support these efforts with an appropriate economic package </p><p>that efficiently delivers such services as sanitation, medical </p><p>care, security, and development. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Finance Minister is developing a reform package </p><p>to present to the cabinet and the people that will address </p><p>three priorities: fiscal balance, anti-corruption, and </p><p>privatization and administrative reform. As described, many of </p><p>the specifics of these priorities mutually support one </p><p>another. The package should meet his goal of accelerated </p><p>implementation and meet conditions set by the Asian </p><p>Development Bank, the World Bank, and the International </p><p>Monetary Fund. He plans to unveil this package along with his </p><p>assessment of the economy. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Finance Minister identified a few specific items </p><p>of action: strengthening the Nepal Rastra Bank (central bank) </p><p>to provide it greater autonomy, and the immediate shedding of </p><p>half a dozen public enterprises through privatization or </p><p>closure of non-performing enterprises. While he sees these </p><p>items as important components of his priorities, no further </p><p>details were provided. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Security and Donor Assistance </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Ambassador welcomed the priorities of the Finance </p><p>Minister and offered the assistance of the USG to help </p><p>accomplish them. As a first step, the Ambassador offered a </p><p>briefing on the security assistance to be provided by the USG </p><p>in order to coordinate it with the budget requests made by the </p><p>Nepali security forces. The Finance Minister expressed </p><p>appreciation for the offer and explained that U.S. assistance, </p><p>by meeting a significant portion of Nepal\'s urgent security </p><p>needs, would help to free up funding for the development </p><p>portions of the budget--which he termed as negligible this </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The USAID Director took the opportunity to press the </p><p>Finance Minister for the quick approval of the first project </p><p>under USAID\'s Conflict Mitigation Program, the Gulmi Road--a </p><p>15.7 km road project linking 21 Village Development Committees </p><p>in the northern reaches of Gulmi, from Indergauda to Chhaldi </p><p>River, in Nepal\'s mid-Western hills. The effort completes a </p><p>project initiated by the EU and represents the first USAID </p><p>effort with funding from DFID, the British development agency. </p><p>The Finance Minister was encouraged by the low-technology/high- </p><p>employment approach, which will employ 600 people, roughly 20 </p><p>percent of whom will be women. He hoped that other donors </p><p>could duplicate this effort across the country. He instructed </p><p>Joint Secretary for Foreign Aid, Madhiv Ghimire, to process </p><p>the letter of implementation as soon as possible to facilitate </p><p>this effort. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Commerce and Trade </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Ambassador raised several commercial issues with </p><p>the Finance Minister regarding some of the difficulties U.S. </p><p>businesses are experiencing in Nepal. He highlighted the </p><p>difficulties of the private Bhote Koshi/Panda Energy project </p><p>regarding duty waivers for replacement parts and the extra- </p><p>contractual deductions taken on payments for energy delivered. </p><p>He also raised the delay in processing the duty assessment of </p><p>the Lotus Energy REVA electric cars (product of a Indian- </p><p>American joint venture in Hyderabad) that have been held in </p><p>customs for eight months. Finally, the Ambassador expressed </p><p>the need to continue infrastructure investment to meet the </p><p>needs of a growing population, tying it to the timely </p><p>completion of the rural telephone project, in which STM </p><p>Wireless of California is the major supplier. The requests of </p><p>the Ambassador were welcomed by the Finance Minister, who </p><p>stated that he would look into them as part of fostering </p><p>cooperation between the U.S. and Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) In a similar vein, the Finance Minister requested </p><p>assistance from the U.S. in providing breathing space through </p><p>duty free access (similar to AGOA) for textile products until </p><p>expiration of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. The breathing </p><p>space will allow the industry to restructure in order to be </p><p>more competitive. The Finance Minister discussed the creation </p><p>of a lobby in Washington to argue the merits of Nepal\'s case. </p><p>One of the arguments he offered includes the side-benefits of </p><p>women\'s empowerment, education opportunities, and family </p><p>planning activities that take place in the garment industry, </p><p>due to the concentration there of women. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
