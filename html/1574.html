(C) SUMMARY: ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION RACE </p><p>HAS NARROWED TO TWO PEOPLE SHOULD PRESIDENT ROBERT </p><p>MUGABE DECIDE NOT TO RUN FOR REELECTION IN THE EARLY </p><p>2002 RACE.  SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA IS </p><p>IN THE STRONGEST POSITION TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>REINS, WITH HIS VERY CLOSE TIES TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE </p><p>PARTY\'S "OLD GUARD," ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS.  FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI IS IN SECOND PLACE IN THE </p><p>SUCCESSION RACE, AND HIS LACK OF STRONG TIES TO ANY ONE </p><p>FACTION AND HIS APPEAL AMONG ZIMBABWE\'S SMALL BUT </p><p>INFLUENTIAL MIDDLE CLASS, MAKE HIM A STRONG CONTENDER </p><p>AMONG THE PARTY\'S MODERATES.  THE PRESIDENTIAL HOPES OF </p><p>OTHER AMBITIOUS LEADERS, SUCH AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>MINISTER IGNATIUS CHOMBO AND HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN </p><p>NKOMO, ARE FADING FAST AS THEY FAIL TO MAKE THEMSELVES </p><p>KNOWN TO THE ELECTORATE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLOFF SPOKE TO MASIPULA SITHOLE, A POLITICAL </p><p>SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00975  01 OF 03  120948Z </p><p>INFLUENTIAL COLUMNIST, AND DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION, ON MARCH 6 ABOUT THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE </p><p>IN ZANU-PF.  POLOFF ALSO INTERVIEWED IDEN WETHERELL, </p><p>EDITOR OF "THE ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT" NEWSPAPER ON MARCH </p><p>7 ON THE SAME SUBJECT.  ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE HAS EVERY INTENTION OF RUNNING AGAIN IN EARLY </p><p>2002, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY ANOINT A </p><p>SUCCESSOR IF HE DETERMINES BY YEAR\'S END THAT HE CANNOT </p><p>WIN REELECTION, RATHER THAN RISK AN OPPOSITION VICTORY. </p><p>MORE LIKELY, HOWEVER, MUGABE WILL RESIGN MIDWAY THROUGH </p><p>A FINAL TERM AND HAND THE REINS TO A SUCCESSOR AT THAT </p><p>POINT.  THIS MESSAGE EXAMINES WHO HAS THE BEST CHANCE AT </p><p>THIS POINT OF BECOMING THAT SUCCESSOR. </p><p> </p><p>MNANGAGWA LEADS THE PACK </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA IS IN </p><p>THE STRONGEST POSITION TO SUCCEED PRESIDENT MUGABE, THE </p><p>CONTACTS WE TALKED TO AGREED.  SITHOLE CALLED MNANGAGWA </p><p>"THE PRINCE\'S FAVORITE" BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG-TIME AND </p><p>VERY CLOSE TIES.  (SITHOLE CALLS MUGABE "THE PRINCE" </p><p>BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT READS THE MACHIAVELLI WORK OVER </p><p>AND OVER AGAIN, THE PROFESSOR MUSED.)  SITHOLE RECOUNTED </p><p>MNANGAGWA\'S DAYS WORKING WITH MUGABE DURING THE </p><p>LIBERATION STRUGGLE WHILE IN EXILE IN THE LATE 1970S. </p><p>AS MUGABE\'S CHIEF OF SECURITY, MNANGAGWA PROVIDED </p><p>INFORMATION TO MUGABE ON THE ACTIVITIES OF HIS RIVALS IN </p><p>THE LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  MNANGAGWA\'S REPORTS LED MUGABE </p><p>TO IMPRISON A NUMBER OF MOVEMENT POLITICIANS, INCLUDING </p><p>KUMBIRAI KANGAI (FORMER AGRICULTURE MINISTER) AND RUGARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00975  01 OF 03  120948Z </p><p>GUMBO (CURRENT DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS), EVEN </p><p>BEFORE INDEPENDENCE, SITHOLE SAID.  MNANGAGWA LIKELY HAD </p><p>A HAND IN THE DECEMBER 1979 DEATH OF JOSIAH TONGOGARA, </p><p>MUGABE\'S PRINCIPAL RIVAL FOR CONTROL OF THE ZANU </p><p>MOVEMENT AT THE TIME, THE PROFESSOR STATED.  AFTER </p><p>INDEPENDENCE IN 1980, MNANGAGWA, AS MUGABE\'S NEW </p><p>MINISTER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AND OVERSEER OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, PUT SPIES ON </p><p>VIRTUALLY EVERY PROMINENT FIGURE IN ZANU, WHICH </p><p>STRENGTHENED MUGABE\'S HOLD ON THE PARTY IMMEASURABLY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MNANGAGWA\'S POSITION AS MUGABE\'S "FAVORITE" </p><p>COULD ACTUALLY TURN OUT TO BE LIABILITY FOR MNANGAGWA, </p><p>SITHOLE ARGUED.  MUGABE IS NOT WELL LIKED IN THE PARTY, </p><p>AND MNANGAGWA\'S VERY CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH HIM DOES NOT </p><p>IMPROVE MNANGAGWA\'S ALREADY VERY LOW POPULARITY RATINGS. </p><p>IF THE PARTY HAD HAD ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT MNANGAGWA\'S </p><p>ELECTION AS SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT IN AUGUST 2000, THE </p><p>SPEAKER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD AS A </p><p>CANDIDATE, THE COLUMNIST SURMISED.  HE IS SPEAKER </p><p>BECAUSE MUGABE WANTED IT THAT WAY.  ZANU-PF WOULD NEVER </p><p>VOLUNTARILY NOMINATE MNANGAGWA AS ITS CANDIDATE FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT, EITHER; IT WOULD ONLY DO SO IF MUGABE IMPOSED </p><p>HIS CANDIDACY, SITHOLE CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0302 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00975  02 OF 03  120948Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------D058CE  120948Z /38 </p><p>P 120946Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8393 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000975 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SA C.

(C) "THE INDEPENDENT" EDITOR WETHERELL DESCRIBED </p><p>MNANGAGWA AS A "NIMBLE OPERATOR," AND "ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>INTELLIGENT MEN IN GOVERNMENT," WHICH MAKES HIM ALL THE </p><p>MORE DANGEROUS.  THE SPEAKER ALSO HAS A VERY ASTUTE </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS\' AGENDAS AND GLOBAL </p><p>ISSUES, AND KNOWS ALL THE RIGHT THINGS TO SAY ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND OTHER WESTERN CONCERNS.  HE IS GOOD AT </p><p>"PLAYING TO ALL GALLERIES," THE EDITOR REMARKED. </p><p>NONETHELESS, MNANGAGWA IS NOT WELL-LIKED IN THE PARTY, </p><p>OR THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE -- HIS FAILED BID TO BECOME </p><p>ZANU-PF NATIONAL CHAIRMAN IN DECEMBER 1999 AND HIS </p><p>RESOUNDING LOSS OF HIS KWEKWE PARLIAMENTARY SEAT LAST </p><p>JUNE ARE AMPLE EVIDENCE OF THIS, WETHERELL STATED. </p><p>MNANGAGWA WOULD BE MORE OF A LIABILITY TO ZANU-PF THAN </p><p>MUGABE SHOULD THE SPEAKER BECOME THE PARTY\'S </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, WETHERELL OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE MARCH 2-8 EDITION OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED "THE MIRROR" REPORTED THAT THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL RESTRUCTURING EFFORT CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IN </p><p>ZANU-PF (REF B) IS DESIGNED TO PUT IN LOCAL LEADERS WHO </p><p>CAN EFFECTIVELY "MARKET" MNANGAGWA AS A PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATE TO THE MASSES.  THE ARTICLE ALSO REPORTED THAT </p><p>THE SYSTEMATIC SIDELINING IN ZANU-PF OF MASVINGO LEADER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00975  02 OF 03  120948Z </p><p>AND MNANGAGWA RIVAL EDDISON ZVOBGO (REF C) IS SUPPOSED </p><p>TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR A MNANGAGWA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY. </p><p>ZVOBGO WAS REPORTED TO HAVE LED THE EFFORT TO THWART </p><p>MNANGAGWA\'S BID TO BECOME ZANU-PF\'S NATIONAL CHAIRMAN IN </p><p>DECEMBER 1999, AND IS BEING SIDELINED AS PUNISHMENT AND </p><p>TO ENSURE HE DOES NOT PRESENT AN OBSTACLE TO MNANGAGWA\'S </p><p>ASCENDANCY.  MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TOLD </p><p>VISITING DAS MARK BELLAMY ON MARCH 9 (REF A) THAT </p><p>MNANGAGWA IS THE ONLY ZANU-PF CANDIDATE WITH THE CLOUT </p><p>TO SUCCEED MUGABE.  "THE MDC WOULD WELCOME HIS </p><p>CANDIDACY," THE OPPOSITION LEADER VOLUNTEERED, REFERRING </p><p>TO THE SPEAKER\'S LOW POPULARITY AND REPUTATION FOR </p><p>TRUCULENCE. </p><p> </p><p>MAKONI IS IN SECOND PLACE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI WOULD BE ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IF THE PARTY HAD ANY SAY IN THE </p><p>MATTER, ACCORDING TO SITHOLE.  MAKONI\'S STRENGTH IS THAT </p><p>HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY STRONG TIES TO ANY PARTICULAR </p><p>FACTION IN ZANU-PF, WHICH MAKES HIM AN IDEAL CANDIDATE </p><p>ON WHOM EVERYONE CAN AGREE, THE PROFESSOR OPINED.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, MAKONI APPEALS TO ZIMBABWE\'S RELATIVELY SMALL </p><p>BUT INFLUENTIAL MIDDLE CLASS THAT DOMINATES THE URBAN </p><p>AREAS.  SITHOLE BELIEVES THAT MAKONI IS MAKING AN </p><p>IMPRESSION ON THE ZANU-PF MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE HE IS </p><p>PERSUASIVE, KNOWLEDGEABLE ON WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUES, AND </p><p>LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WHO COULD HAVE A VISION FOR THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  (NOTE: WHEN PRESSED, SITHOLE DID NOT KNOW WHAT </p><p>THAT VISION MIGHT BE, HOWEVER.  END NOTE.)  MAKONI IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00975  02 OF 03  120948Z </p><p>ALSO SMART ENOUGH TO CULTIVATE A CORDIAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH THE MDC.  HE COULD BE A MINISTER OF FINANCE UNDER </p><p>AN MDC-LED GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY, SHOULD THE MDC </p><p>WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, SITHOLE PREDICTED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WETHERELL WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT MAKONI\'S </p><p>PROSPECTS.  HE STATED THAT MNANGAGWA WOULD HAVE TO BE </p><p>COMPLETELY OUT OF THE PICTURE IN ORDER FOR MAKONI TO </p><p>HAVE ANY SHOT AT THE PRESIDENCY.  MAKONI HAS NO POWER </p><p>BASE OF HIS OWN, AND IS A PRODUCT OF THE ZANU-PF SYSTEM </p><p>OF "BARONIAL FIEFDOMS," WETHERELL COMMENTED.  MAKONI </p><p>TRIED TO ESTABLISH HIS OWN BASE IN MANICALAND IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS, BUT FAILED.  DESPITE HIS SHORTCOMINGS, MANY IN </p><p>THE PARTY SEE HIM AS THEIR "GREAT BLACK HOPE."  HE HAS </p><p>AN EXCELLENT GRASP OF ECONOMICS AND POLICYMAKING AND HAS </p><p>THE ABILITY TO LEAD THE COUNTRY OUT OF ECONOMIC RUIN, </p><p>THE EDITOR OFFERED.  A NUMBER OF ZANU-PF\'S EMERGING </p><p>YOUNG POWER BARONS, SUCH AS CHINHOYI MP PHILLIP </p><p>CHIYANGWA AND MOUNT DARWIN SOUTH MP TYSON KASUKUWERE, </p><p>ARE WITHHOLDING THEIR SUPPORT FOR MAKONI BECAUSE THEY </p><p>ARE AFRAID TO BACK THE WRONG HORSE.  THEY ARE MORE </p><p>INTERESTED IN SELF-ENRICHMENT, ANYWAY, AND MAKONI\'S </p><p>REFORM POLICIES COULD JEOPARDIZE THEIR SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>BUSINESS LINKAGES TO ZANU-PF, ACCORDING TO WETHERELL. </p><p>IN REF A MEETING, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI DISMISSED MAKONI\'S </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0305 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00975  03 OF 03  120948Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------D058DE  120948Z /38 </p><p>P 120946Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8394 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000975 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SA C.

MASVINGO ZANU-PF "SUPREMO" ZVOBGO, ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, IMPLIED HIS SUPPORT OF MAKONI TO US, SAYING </p><p>THAT MANY WOULD THROW THEIR WEIGHT BEHIND HIM BECAUSE OF </p><p>HIS POPULAR APPEAL. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER CONTENDERS FALLING FAR BEHIND </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS OF MINISTER OF LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL HOUSING IGNATIUS </p><p>CHOMBO ARE FADING FAST, BOTH SITHOLE AND WETHERELL </p><p>AGREED.  ALTHOUGH SOME THINK HE IS PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>MATERIAL, CHOMBO IS TOO CLOSE TO MUGABE TO HAVE HIS OWN </p><p>SUPPORT BASE, SITHOLE OPINED.  IN FACT, CHOMBO IS A </p><p>DISTANT COUSIN OF MUGABE AND CAME FROM THE SAME VILLAGE </p><p>IN ZVIMBA DISTRICT AS THE PRESIDENT, THE PROFESSOR </p><p>ASSERTED.  WETHERELL DESCRIBED CHOMBO AS THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>"BLUE-EYED BOY," BUT NOT AS PARTICULARLY BRIGHT OR </p><p>POLITICALLY ASTUTE.  ZANU-PF NATIONAL CHAIRMAN JOHN </p><p>NKOMO, WHO COMPLETELY LACKS ANY CHARISMA, LOST HIS </p><p>CHANCE FOR THE PRESIDENCY WHEN HE FAILED TO WIN A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SEAT LAST JUNE, THE EDITOR REMARKED. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, NKOMO HAS FAILED TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00975  03 OF 03  120948Z </p><p>AMONG ZIMBABWEAN VOTERS, WETHERELL CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) BOTH INTERLOCUTORS AGREED THAT MINISTER FOR </p><p>INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY JONATHAN MOYO IS DESPISED IN </p><p>ZANU-PF AND WILL NEVER BE ANYTHING MORE THAN "PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S MAN."  IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT MOYO COULD BECOME </p><p>A PRIME MINISTER UNDER A FINAL MUGABE TERM AND AMENDED </p><p>CONSTITUTION, BUT AS SOON AS MUGABE GOES, SO WILL MOYO, </p><p>WETHERELL BELIEVES.  MOYO IS ONE OF THE MOST HATED </p><p>FIGURES IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AND NO ONE OTHER THAN </p><p>MUGABE WILL BACK HIM. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) IT APPEARS THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION </p><p>RACE IS NARROWING TO TWO PEOPLE: MNANGAGWA AND MAKONI. </p><p>SHOULD SOMETHING HAPPEN TO MUGABE TOMORROW, MNANGAGWA IS </p><p>BEST POSITIONED TO STEP IN, PICK UP THE PIECES, AND </p><p>CONSOLIDATE POWER.  DESPITE THE COMMON REFRAIN THAT </p><p>MNANGAGWA IS WIDELY HATED IN THE PARTY FOR HIS </p><p>RUTHLESSNESS, ONE CAN ALSO SEE IN HIM A PRAGMATIC AND </p><p>SKILLFUL POLITICIAN THAT COULD HOLD A GOVERNMENT </p><p>TOGETHER AND SOOTH AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE.  IT IS FAR </p><p>FROM CLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER HE WOULD MAKE THE HARD </p><p>CHOICES TO SHORE UP ZIMBABWE\'S CRUMBLING DEMOCRATIC </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND COLLAPSING ECONOMY.  MNANGAGWA WOULD </p><p>REPRESENT A CONTINUATION OF THE MUGABE ERA, AND POSSIBLY </p><p>A VERY LONG CONTINUATION AT THAT, SHOULD MUGABE HOLD THE </p><p>MDC AT BAY IN THE ELECTION AND PASS THE BATON TO </p><p>MNANGAGWA. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00975  03 OF 03  120948Z </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: MAKONI, ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>WOULD LIKELY TRY TO IMPLEMENT THE DEMOCRATIC AND </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORMS NEEDED TO TURN ZIMBABWE AROUND, BUT HE </p><p>MAY NOT HAVE THE POLITICAL SKILLS TO HOLD A FRACTIOUS </p><p>GOVERNMENT TOGETHER OR FEND OFF CHALLENGES FROM THE </p><p>OPPOSITION.  MAKONI, YOUNGER THAN MUGABE AND MNANGAGWA, </p><p>WOULD REPRESENT A CLEAN BREAK FROM THE OLD ZANU-PF, AND </p><p>COULD PROBABLY GARNER REAL PUBLIC SUPPORT.  HIS TENURE </p><p>COULD BE SHORTENED, HOWEVER, BY MORE WILY AND RUTHLESS </p><p>OPERATIVES IN ZANU-PF.  ZIMBABWEAN VOTERS COULD YET HAVE </p><p>THE FINAL SAY, HOWEVER, AND CAST OUT THE WHOLE ZANU-PF </p><p>LOT AND GIVE THE MDC A CHANCE AT GOVERNING.
