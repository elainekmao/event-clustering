<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000946 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, NEA/RA, INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  IRAQ, POSTURING AT THE UN SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL, AND THE UAE AT THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  COVERAGE RELATED TO IRAQ CONTINUED TO GENERATE </p><p>PROMINENT COVERAGE IN THE LOCAL MEDIA.  UAE DAILIES LARGELY </p><p>COVERED UAE\'S PARTICIPATION AT THE NAM CONFERENCE AND ITS CALL </p><p>FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL UNSC RESOLUTIONS REGARDING IRAQ AND </p><p>PALESTINE.  EDITORIALS CONTINUED TO LAUD THE FRENCH-GERMAN </p><p>POSITION AT THE UN AND CRITICIZE ARAB INACTION IN THE FACE OF AN </p><p>IMPENDING ATTACK ON IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON ARAB, FRENCH, RUSSIAN, AND GERMAN ATTITUDES </p><p>TOWARDS THE ANTICIPATED WAR ON IRAQ, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/26: </p><p> </p><p>"...  STOPPING THE BLOODSHED OF IRAQIS, PALESTINIANS, OR EVEN </p><p>ARABS IN GENERAL IS ONE OF THE DEFINITE RESPONSIBILITIES OF ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THE FRENCH-RUSSIAN-GERMAN POSITION REGARDING THIS </p><p>ISSUE WILL NOT BE PRODUCTIVE IF NOT BACKED WITH A SINCERE ARAB </p><p>STAND.  THIS SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF AN ARAB SUMMIT DURING THIS </p><p>CRITICAL PHASE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON ARAB ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE ANTICIPATED WAR ON </p><p>IRAQ, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON </p><p>2/26: </p><p> </p><p>"...  THE ARAB SUMMIT (WHICH NO ONE KNOWS WILL SEE THE LIGHT OR </p><p>NOT) FACES OPPOSITION AND CONFLICT AMONG ITS MEMBERS EVEN BEFORE </p><p>IT OCCURS.  THIS IS A CONFLICT AMONG THE HANDICAPPED.  THEREFORE, </p><p>WHETHER THE SUMMIT TAKES PLACE OR NOT, WHETHER IT\'S POSTPONED OR </p><p>NOT, WILL NOT AFFECT OR CHANGE THE CURRENT SITUATION, SINCE ARABS </p><p>LACK THE POWER OR THE WILL TO MAKE A DECISION.  THEY HAVE ALREADY </p><p>ABANDONED THEIR WILLPOWER AND EVEN THEIR DIGNITY.  WHAT IS </p><p>HAPPENING NOW IS MERELY (LIKE) \'PLAYING IN OVERTIME.\'" </p><p> </p><p>4.  NOTING A U.S. DOUBLE STANDARD ON ISRAEL\'S USE OF HUMAN </p><p>SHIELDS IN PALESTINE VERSUS SADDAM\'S CALL FOR HUMAN SHIELDS IN </p><p>IRAQ, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/25: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE ISRAELI CRIMES COMMITTED IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE WORLD ARE </p><p>CONSIDERED SELF DEFENSE ACTIONS BY THE U.S., WHICH SUPPORTS THE </p><p>ATTACKS ... THE AMERICAN ATTITUDE HERE IS NOT SURPRISING, </p><p>ESPECIALLY AFTER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION\'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE </p><p>WORLDWIDE ANTI-WAR PROTESTS IN THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY ARE NOT AN </p><p>ISSUE TO WORRY ABOUT.  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS </p><p>DEFENDING THE IRAQI PEOPLE A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY, WHEREAS </p><p>CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST PALESTINIANS ARE HUMANE ACTIONS </p><p>DESERVING PRESIDENT BUSH\'S NOMINATION OF SHARON FOR A NOBLE PEACE </p><p>PRIZE ... ERASING A SEVEN-THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD CIVILIZATION IS YET </p><p>ANOTHER TECHNIQUE ADOPTED BY AMERICA.  BUSH COMPARES ARABS TO </p><p>\'RED INDIANS\' AND BELIEVES THEY SHOULD BE DEMOLISHED WHEREVER </p><p>THEY ARE FOUND." </p><p> </p><p>5.  DESCRIBING AN AMERICAN INTENTION TO DOMINATE THE WORLD, DR. </p><p>MOHAMMED ALI AL-FARRA WROTE IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT </p><p>"AL-ITTIHAD" 2/25: </p><p> </p><p>"IT\'S A BIG MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THE REASONS BEHIND THE GULF WAR </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ IN 1991 WERE ITS OCCUPATION OF KUWAIT IN 1990, OR </p><p>THAT THE INTENTIONS OF THE ANTICIPATED WAR AGAINST IRAQ ARE </p><p>DISARMING IT OF WMD AND CHANGING ITS REGIME.  THE TRUE REASONS </p><p>ARE PART OF A LARGER SCENARIO THAT DATES BACK TO THE 1973 WAR ... </p><p>THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS WHAT IT CALLS \'SAFE HAVENS </p><p>FOR TERRORISM\' OR \'ROGUE STATES\' AS MOST PROBABLY THE SAME MAIN </p><p>POWER RESOURCES IN THE WORLD, WHICH LATELY INCLUDES VENEZUELA </p><p>SINCE IT IS THE LAREGST OIL-PRODUCING NATION IN THE WESTERN </p><p>HEMISPHERE ...  THE MAP OF THE OIL AND GAS LINES IN THE REGION </p><p>CONNECT THE BALKANS WITH AFGHANISTAN, WHICH EXPLAINS AMERICA\'S </p><p>INTERFERENCE IN KOSOVO\'S WAR WHICH WAS NOT (AS THOUGHT BY MANY) </p><p>TO SUPPORT MUSLIMS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PETROLEUM PIPELINES </p><p>TO WESTERN EUROPE MUST GO THROUGH THE BALKANS.  THERE WAS A </p><p>SUGGESTION TO HAVE A LINE STARTING FROM BURGAS IN BULGARIA </p><p>THROUGH SKOPJE IN MACEDONIA TO VLORE SEAPORT IN ALBANIA.  A HUGE </p><p>AMERICAN MILITARY BASE \'BOND STEEL CAMP\' WAS ESTABLISHED DURING </p><p>THE YEAR 1999 SOUTH OF KOSOVO, WHICH WAS RUN BY AN OIL COMPANY </p><p>MANAGED BY U.S. VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY." </p><p> </p><p>6.  DISCUSSING WORLD OPINION OF THE U.S., "AL BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 2/24: </p><p> </p><p>"ALL INDICATIONS IN THE WORLD, SUCH AS THE PROTESTS OF SEVEN </p><p>MILLION PEOPLE IN OVER 600 CITIES A WEEK AGO, PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>OPPOSING WASHINGTON\'S POLICIES, AND THE SITUATION FACING THE U.S. </p><p>IN THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AS THE MAJORITY OF THE 15-MEMBER </p><p>COUNCIL ARE AGAINST WAR, CONFIRM WITH NO DOUBT THAT WORLD PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION OPPOSED U.S. POLICIES.  ALL THESE REASONS ILLUSTRATE AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OPINION THAT IS ANTI-WAR ... THE IMAGE OF THE U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS GETTING WORSE DAY AFTER DAY FOLLOWING THE LOSS OF </p><p>ITS CREDIBILITY.  THE MOST RECENT PUBLIC OPINION POLLS PUBLISHED </p><p>IN THE SUNDAY TIMES, A BRITISH NEWSPAPER, SAY THAT HALF OF THE </p><p>BRITISH PEOPLE CONSIDER BUSH A BIG THREAT TO PEACE IN THE WORLD. </p><p>ALSO, 47 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION VIEW THE U.S. AS A DOMINATING </p><p>POWER WHILE (IN A SEPARATE POLL) 54 PERCENT DO NOT EVEN LIKE IT." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
