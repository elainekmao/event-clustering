<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003942 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, DKAGAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, IT, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: CAREFUL USG-GOI COORDINATION ESSENTIAL ON ITALIAN </p><p>TROOP CONTRIBUTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03942  091551Z </p><p>REF: A. A) ROME 3795 </p><p>     B. B) STATE 134761 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARA 3. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  WE UNDERSTAND FROM E-MAIL TRAFFIC THAT THE USG </p><p>PREFERS TO ACCEPT ITALY\'S OFFER OF TROOPS FOR OPERATION </p><p>ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) RATHER THAN THE GOI\'S OFFER TO </p><p>BACKFILL IN THE BALKANS (REF A).  IT WILL TAKE CAREFUL </p><p>HANDLING BY PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI AND DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>MARTINO TO SHEPHERD THIS THROUGH PARLIAMENTARY CONSULTATIONS. </p><p> WITH BERLUSCONI AND MANY SENIOR DECISION-MAKERS OUT OF ROME </p><p>ON HOLIDAY, A GOI "GAME-PLAN" MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO </p><p>ORCHESTRATE.  THE NEED TO PLAN -- AND IMPLEMENT -- A </p><p>POLITICAL STRATEGY MAY EXPLAIN WHY NO SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS </p><p>HAVE BEEN ISSUED THROUGH THE MOD CHAIN OF COMMAND REGARDING </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S CONDITIONAL DECISION TO CONTRIBUTE TROOPS.  THE </p><p>OPPOSITION, PRESS AND PUBLIC COULD EASILY MISINTERPRET </p><p>USG-GOI PRELIMINARY STEPS TO COORDINATE ITALIAN PARTICIPATION </p><p>AS AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOI TO CIRCUMVENT PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW </p><p>-- AND ITALY\'S OPPOSITION, WHICH LACKS MANY ISSUES IT CAN USE </p><p>AGAINST THE POPULAR PRIME MINISTER, WOULD BE ONLY TOO EAGER </p><p>TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY.  THIS COULD CREATE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL FALL-OUT FOR BERLUSCONI, EVEN </p><p>ULTIMATELY DERAILING THE OFFER TO CONTRIBUTE.  DUE TO THE </p><p>EXTREMELY SENSITIVE NATURE OF THIS ISSUE POLITICALLY WITHIN </p><p>ITALY, WE URGE CAREFUL, COMPREHENSIVE AND QUIET USG-GOI </p><p>COORDINATION, AND EMPHASIZE THAT THE GOI OFFER REMAINS </p><p>SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY PARLIAMENT WHEN IT RECONVENES IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03942  091551Z </p><p>MID-SEPTEMBER.  IN ADDITION, WE SHOULD NOT ASSUME AT THIS </p><p>POINT THAT THE GREEN LIGHT WE RECEIVED FROM BERLUSCONI </p><p>EXTENDS BEYOND THE REQUEST FOR GROUND TROOPS OR SPECIAL OPS </p><p>FORCES SPECIFIED IN REF B.  IN PARTICULAR, ALL USG AGENCIES </p><p>SHOULD AVOID PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ITALIAN </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN ORDER TO AVOID COMPLICATING THE GOI\'S </p><p>MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC REACTION.  WE SHOULD NOT BE THE ONES TO </p><p>ANNOUNCE ITALY\'S COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) EMBASSY IS INFORMED THAT A REQUEST FOR FORCES IS BEING </p><p>PREPARED IN COORDINATION WITH THE ITALIAN LNO CELL AT CENTCOM </p><p>THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY THE FORCES REQUESTED IN REF B, WHICH </p><p>BERLUSCONI HAS APPROVED IN PRINCIPLE, BUT ALSO ENGINEERS AND </p><p>DEMINERS.  IN REF A, GOI OFFICIALS ASKED FOR A GENERAL </p><p>STATEMENT OF WHICH FORCES, AND FOR WHAT MISSION, THE USG IS </p><p>SEEKING FROM ITALY. WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE FOR </p><p>DELIVERY TO OFFICIALS AT MOD, MFA AND IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE: </p><p> </p><p>-- OUR REQUEST: THE USG IS REQUESTING THAT ITALY CONTRIBUTE A </p><p>LIGHT INFANTRY MANEUVER BATTALION, EQUIPPED WITH LIGHT </p><p>RECONNAISSANCE/SECURITY VEHICLES, TO REPLACE A COALITION </p><p>BATTALION DUE TO ROTATE OUT OF AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MISSION: THE PROPOSED MISSION FOR THE ITALIAN </p><p>BATTALION IS SENSITIVE SITE EXPLORATION, TIME-SENSITIVE </p><p>TARGET POST-STRIKE EXPLOITATION, SUPPORT TO HUMANITARIAN </p><p>OPERATIONS, AIRFIELD SECURITY, AREA RECONNAISSANCE AND COMBAT </p><p>OPERATIONS TO DESTROY AL-QAIDA/TALIBAN FORCES.  SPECIFIC </p><p>BASING LOCATION FOR ITALIAN FORCES IS TO BE DETERMINED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03942  091551Z </p><p>-- TIMING: THE PROPOSED MISSION DURATION IS FROM JANUARY </p><p>THROUGH JULY 2003, WITH EXTENSION OR BACKFILL IF POSSIBLE </p><p>BEYOND JULY 2003. </p><p> </p><p>ACTION REQUEST. PLEASE CONFIRM THAT THIS BRIEF STATEMENT IS </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH THE MORE DETAILED RFF BEING PREPARED. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, IF THE USG WANTS TO SPECIFY ALPINI FORCES OR </p><p>REQUEST ENGINEERS, MINE CLEARING UNITS, SPECIAL OPERATIONS </p><p>UNITS AND/OR OTHER MILITARY ASSETS, PLEASE INCLUDE IN A </p><p>PRIORITIZED LIST COORDINATED WITH DEFENSE AND STATE.  IF THE </p><p>NUMBER OF FORCES NEEDED IS AVAILABLE, PLEASE PROVIDE. </p><p>EMBASSY ROME CAN THEN APPROACH GOI POLITICAL AND MILITARY </p><p>DECISION-MAKERS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE REQUEST FOR ASSETS IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF OEF. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WE ARE ENCOURAGING THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE AND THE </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER\'S OFFICE TO CONVEY THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>DECISION TO CONTRIBUTE FORCES (SUBJECT TO PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>REVIEW) TO THE UNIFORMED STAFF AND THE CENTCOM LNO CELL. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03942 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
