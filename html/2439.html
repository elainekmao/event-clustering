IS IT BECAUSE ZIMBABWE IS A SMALL AFRICAN STATE THAT </p><p>    SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE A </p><p>    VASSAL. . . ?  ALTHOUGH MUSHARAF\'S GOVERNMENT USES A </p><p>    WIDE RANGE OF LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS TO CURB </p><p>    PRESS FREEDOM, THE AMERICAN CONGRESS STILL HAS NOT COME </p><p>    UP WITH A PAKISTANI DEMOCRACY BILL.
