<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000472 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, PREL, NI, OIL </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: MEETING WITH NNPC MANAGING DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  On January 31, Ambassador Jeter and </p><p>Econoff met with Nigerian National Petroleum </p><p>Corporation (NNPC) Group Managing Director, Jackson </p><p>Gaius-Obaseki, and NNPC Group Executive Director, </p><p>Refining and Petrochemicals Directorate, Mansur Ahmed. </p><p>Gaius-Obaseki told the Ambassador that the NNPC was </p><p>concerned about financial transparency in the oil </p><p>sector. Ahmed said the productivity of Nigeria\'s </p><p>refineries has improved; however, Gaius-Obaseki added </p><p>that the refineries should be privatized. </p><p>Nonetheless, he went on to note that it would be </p><p>politically impossible to raise motor fuel prices in </p><p>order to earn more revenue through the sale of what </p><p>most Nigerians see as their nation\'s patrimony. </p><p>Gaius-Obaseki dismissed Presidential aspirant Buhari\'s </p><p>promise of reform in the energy sector, should he be </p><p>elected president. President Obasanjo deserves praise </p><p>for implementing reforms, but he is only one man, and </p><p>reform is slow.  Gaius-Obaseki pointed to expanding </p><p>LNG production and timely NNPC cash calls to oil </p><p>companies as positive developments, but acknowledged </p><p>that the NNPC still owes money to oil companies </p><p>arising from previous military administrations.  The </p><p>Ambassador commended NNPC\'s ongoing efforts to resolve </p><p>the problems.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Transparency in the Oil Sector </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The Ambassador noted there was a growing movement </p><p>in the U.S. and UK governments, NGOs, and the media to </p><p>promote greater transparency in extractive industries. </p><p>Gaius-Obeseki replied that the NNPC has made great </p><p>progress in transparency. NNPC accounting is </p><p>transparent, he said, and he referred the Ambassador </p><p>to the NNPC webpage as an example of this effort. </p><p>Gaius-Obaseki added that the NNPC\'s critics are mainly </p><p>in the National Assembly.  "If you had been here in </p><p>late 1998, to be honest, [you would have seen that] we </p><p>NNPC officials were not sure then that we would be </p><p>here today (still under democratic rule)," commented </p><p>The Group Managing Director. Nigeria was lucky that </p><p>democracy had taken root. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Status of Oil Refineries </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Ahmed updated the Ambassador on Nigeria\'s state- </p><p>owned refineries.  He said the refineries were doing </p><p>better, but "they are not yet where they should be." </p><p>He remarked that some of the refineries, such as </p><p>Kaduna\'s, have raised their refining levels to 70% of </p><p>capacity, but Nigeria\'s four refineries need major </p><p>overhauls and constant maintenance.  Gaius-Obaseki </p><p>said he would like to sell the refineries to private </p><p>investors, but the GON probably had too much at stake </p><p>to completely privatize the refineries.  Nigerians, </p><p>especially before the general elections, will not </p><p>accept motor fuel price hikes.  The Ambassador replied </p><p>that the refineries would need major GON investment to </p><p>make them attractive to private investors. Gaius- </p><p>Obaseki agreed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Laughs for Buhari </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Ambassador disclosed that he had recently </p><p>spoken with Presidential hopeful Buhari, who had said </p><p>NNPC reform would be one of his main area of focus. </p><p>Gaius-Obaseki laughed and remarked, as President </p><p>Obasanjo had stated, that anyone can say he will </p><p>reverse the years of neglect of military rule, but to </p><p>do so is very difficult.  The Managing Director said </p><p>the NNPC has improved dramatically under Obasanjo. </p><p>Gaius-Obaseki advised everyone to be fair with </p><p>Obasanjo; "the President cannot do it all alone." </p><p>Resolving contracting irregularities (corruption and </p><p>lack of transparency in bidding) in Nigeria is an </p><p>uphill battle that is unlikely to be won soon, Gaius- </p><p>Obaseki concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Natural Gas Development Going Strong </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Ambassador stated that he had seen some very </p><p>optimistic numbers in the press, and wondered how much </p><p>earnings from liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales might </p><p>affect the GON\'s budget revenue in the mid- and long- </p><p>term.  The NNPC Managing Director said that revenue </p><p>from LNG would be considerable, but he did not have an </p><p>idea of the projected revenue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Cash Calls and New U.S. Business </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The Ambassador noted that there were still </p><p>disputes, dating from before 1999, about cash-call </p><p>arrears to some U.S. oil companies. Gaius-Obaseki </p><p>replied that the GON is current on cash calls after </p><p>1999, and is slowly paying pre-1999 debt to joint </p><p>venture (JV) companies. (Although the GON is now </p><p>opting for Production Sharing Contract (PSC\'s) for the </p><p>development of deep offshore fields, production from </p><p>JV\'s currently account for nearly all of Nigeria\'s </p><p>crude oil output.  NNPC holds an average 57 percent </p><p>stake with JV partners such as ExxonMobil, Shell and </p><p>ChevronTexaco, which hold an average 43 percent. </p><p>During the Abacha era, the NNPC did not contribute its </p><p>share to JV operations, which resulted in hundreds of </p><p>millions of dollars in arrears. By the end of February </p><p>2003, the NNPC had liquidated almost all of its cash </p><p>call arrears.) The Ambassador told the Managing </p><p>Director that this was good news and noted that </p><p>several of the U.S. major oil companies also had </p><p>commended NNPC for clearing up the arrears.  We were </p><p>also very pleased about the recent successes of Ocean </p><p>Energy and Cooper-Cameron\'s Ehra project.  On Ocean </p><p>Energy, the GON had honored its 2001 commitment to us, </p><p>which, in turn, sent a very positive signal to U.S. </p><p>independent oil companies interested in doing business </p><p>in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>The Delta </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The Ambassador asked for views on the political </p><p>situation in the Delta. Gaius-Obeseki responded that </p><p>"all is quiet."  He said the Niger Delta Development </p><p>Commission (NDDC) was organized and was easing tension </p><p>by providing support to the inhabitants in the Delta. </p><p>The Ambassador said that it appeared that the NDDC has </p><p>made little progress. Gaius-Obaseki then admitted that </p><p>the NNDC has not been as visible as it should have </p><p>been, and it should have engaged more with local </p><p>communities.  The Ambassador asked Gaius-Obaseki what </p><p>he thought about the recent battle between the </p><p>National Assembly and President over the oil dichotomy </p><p>bill. He responded that he was not a politician and </p><p>was staying away from the battle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>OPEC Oil Quota </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Gaius-Obeseki reported that Nigeria\'s crude oil </p><p>production was almost at Nigeria\'s OPEC quota of </p><p>around 2.1 million barrels a day.  The Ambassador </p><p>asked whether Nigeria was looking for a change in the </p><p>OPEC formula for calculating its member-states\' </p><p>quotas. Gaius-Obaseki responded obliquely by saying </p><p>that Nigeria\'s quota remained small, given its </p><p>population and production capacity.  He then suggested </p><p>that all questions about Nigeria\'s quota be put to the </p><p>Presidential Advisor on Petroleum and Energy Affairs, </p><p>Rilwanu Lukman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>NNPC fire in Lagos </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Ambassador said that he was saddened to learn </p><p>about the fire that razed one of the NNPC\'s main </p><p>buildings in Lagos in late December, and stated that </p><p>we were very grateful that no one was hurt. He asked </p><p>if the fire had affected NNPC operations. Gaius- </p><p>Obaseki replied that NNPC workers were relocated to </p><p>other offices and that overall operations were </p><p>unaffected. Gaius-Obaseki ruled out arson, saying the </p><p>fire was caused by an electrical malfunction. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
