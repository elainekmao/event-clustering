<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001619 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: PROMINENT MAOIST SURRENDERS TO HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>COMMISSION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  On August 19 Mukti Pradhan, a member of the Maoist </p><p>Joint Revolutionary Council on the Government of Nepal\'s most </p><p>wanted list, surrendered to members of the National Human </p><p>Rights Commission (NHRC).  In a press conference at NHRC, </p><p>Pradhan said he had decided to turn himself in because he </p><p>wants to live peacefully "within the Constitution."  He also </p><p>cited disenchantment with the Maoists\' current tactics, </p><p>including attacks on village-level infrastructure, which he </p><p>noted could turn Nepal into "a Somalia."  The Government had </p><p>offered a reward of nearly USD 45,000 for information leading </p><p>to the arrest of Pradhan, a lawyer. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  According to human rights activist Subodh </p><p>Pyakurel, after the press conference Pradhan left for his </p><p>Kathmandu home, accompanied by members of the NHRC, where he </p><p>remains under police protection.  He has since been able to </p><p>leave his home on a few occasions--always accompanied by </p><p>friends--to buy food and newspapers.  Pyakurel described </p><p>Pradhan as "terrified" of possible repercussions from both </p><p>the Maoists and the security forces. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment:  The reported arrests of other members of </p><p>the Joint Revolutionary Council, such as Rekha Sharma, Bishnu </p><p>Pukar Shrestha, and Krishna Sen (and the apparent death in </p><p>custody of the latter) may have persuaded Pradhan that </p><p>surrender--and a well-attended press conference announcing </p><p>that surrender--offer the safest course of action.  It </p><p>remains unclear if the police protection offered to Pradhan </p><p>amounts to house arrest, or whether the police may decide to </p><p>detain him elsewhere for questioning. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
