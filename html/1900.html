<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002106 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p>NOFORN </p><p>FOR DRL (TOMLYANOVICH), AF/W (CUNDIFF) AND AF/RA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POST RESPONSE TO IRF EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SBU/NOFORN -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Mission strongly disagrees with some of the statements </p><p>made in the draft IRF Executive Summary on Nigeria emailed to </p><p>Post.  In the interest of accuracy, we suggest replacing the </p><p>text on pages 12 and 13 with the following: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"While the violence of early 2000 was not repeated during the </p><p>reporting period, relations between Christians and Muslims </p><p>remained uneasy and even tense in some parts of Nigeria. </p><p>While most of the conflict during the reporting period was </p><p>inter-ethnic rather than inter-religious in origin, the </p><p>return of  criminal Shari\'a law exacerbated tensions in some </p><p>areas.  Nine Northern states followed Zamfara State\'s lead </p><p>and re-introduced most elements of criminal Shari\'a.  Shari\'a </p><p>law by definition only applies to Muslims, but some Northern </p><p>Christians are concerned that their religious freedoms may be </p><p>infringed by this return to Islamic criminal law.  In some </p><p>states Shari\'a criminal jurisdiction over Muslims is </p><p>mandatory, while in others Muslims may elect to have their </p><p>cases tried in common-law courts.  This represents a change </p><p>from past practice.  Previously, Shari\'a courts only heard </p><p>Muslims\' cases involving family and civil law matters. </p><p>During the reporting period, there were episodic minor </p><p>conflicts between Christians and Muslims in several States </p><p>considering the re-introduction of criminal Shari\'a. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENT:  It is materially inaccurate to assert that </p><p>there "was a deterioration of respect for religious freedom </p><p>during the period covered by this report."  Such a sentence </p><p>detracts from the important information contained in the </p><p>report.  Many Nigerians who could benefit from reading and </p><p>absorbing that information will be so put off by the first </p><p>sentence that they might dismiss the entire report.  That </p><p>would be unfortunate.  The Mission understands that many </p><p>Christians fear and resent the implementation of criminal </p><p>Shari\'a law, just as many Muslims resent the fact that </p><p>British authorities significantly diluted it during the </p><p>colonial period.  For them, the return of criminal Shari\'a </p><p>law restores their lost religious freedom.  One person\'s </p><p>freedom can be another person\'s shackles in a society that </p><p>takes a zero-sum approach to politics.  We would further the </p><p>cause of religious freedom far more effectively by </p><p>acknowledging that these issues are difficult in any </p><p>multi-ethnic, multi-religious society, most particularly in </p><p>one grappling with political transition.  Appearing to take </p><p>sides with Nigeria\'s Christians creates a significant risk of </p><p>harder lines on both sides. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
