<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000044 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ASEC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAOISTS IN NO MOOD FOR COMPROMISE </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) 01 Kathmandu 2504, B) 01 Kathmandu 2437, C) 01 </p><p> </p><p>Kathmandu 2423, D) 01 Kathmandu 2394, E) 01 Kathmandu </p><p>2324, F) 01 Kathmandu 2302 </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary.  In both their words and deeds, Nepal\'s </p><p>Maoist insurgents have shown themselves to be unwilling </p><p>to negotiate, compromise or abandon their armed struggle. </p><p>They have admitted that they would use negotiations or a </p><p>cease-fire as an opportunity to regroup for their next </p><p>offensive.  The Maoists have been steadfastly vehement in </p><p>their condemnation of the Palace, and increasingly </p><p>critical of the U.S.  Events in December quickly proved </p><p>that a Maoist pledge to cease attacks against certain </p><p>targets was a hollow feint designed to gain tactical </p><p>advantage.  Some of these efforts are likely intended to </p><p>defuse mounting international pressure and criticism, </p><p>including possible inclusion on at least one U.S. </p><p>terrorism list.  In the absence of substantial, sustained </p><p>military pressure by Government forces, and whether or </p><p>not they temporarily suspend attacks, the Maoists will </p><p>continue their campaign of terror and duplicity in </p><p>pursuit of their strategic aims.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>No Mood for Compromise </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The record of public statements by leaders of </p><p>Nepal\'s Maoist movement indicates that the insurgents </p><p>have no interest in compromise or negotiation.  Recent </p><p>pronouncements echo previous remarks, when the Maoists </p><p>made it clear they would be disinclined, under any </p><p>circumstances, to give up their armed struggle.  Most </p><p>famously, Maoist ideologue Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who goes </p><p>by the name "Prachanda," told an interviewer in May, </p><p>2001, that the movement\'s "guiding principles on the </p><p>question of negotiations are the experiences of the </p><p>Brest-Litovsk Treaty under Lenin\'s leadership and the </p><p>Chongqing negotiations under Mao\'s leadership."  In both </p><p>cases, the communists used the pretext of engaging in </p><p>talks to regroup and prepare for an offensive. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In the same vein, Dahal told the Far Eastern </p><p>Economic Review in October 2002, that the Maoists would </p><p>not lay down their arms to come to the negotiating table, </p><p>and that possibility for resolving the crisis through </p><p>negotiations would "depend on the level of victory </p><p>achieved on the battlefield." </p><p> </p><p>Monarchy Has to Go, Maoists Insist </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A November 2002, article in India\'s "Economic and </p><p>Political Weekly" by Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai </p><p>takes an equally hard-line position.  Bhattarai\'s article </p><p>divides the Nepali political landscape into three </p><p>factions: the Palace, the parliamentary parties, and the </p><p>Maoists.  He describes the King\'s actions in removing the </p><p>Prime Minister as "retrogressive" and a "putsch," and </p><p>claims the monarch is disinclined to share power. </p><p>Bhattarai makes it clear that the Maoists are against the </p><p>Palace-stating unequivocally that the Maoists will not </p><p>rest until the monarchy is gone.  There is room, however, </p><p>for a rapprochement with the political parties, who, </p><p>Bhattarai suggests, may yet have a role in the </p><p>revolution.  [Comment:  As Post reported previously, the </p><p>Maoists may be using the peace process as a means to </p><p>drive a wedge between the political parties and the </p><p>Palace (Ref A).  End Comment.] </p><p> </p><p>Increasingly, U.S. Focus of Maoist Criticism </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In the same article, Bhattarai singled out the </p><p>U.S. for criticism on several counts, stating that the </p><p>U.S. was behind the June 2001 assassination of Nepal\'s </p><p>King Birendra, was directly in </p><p>volved in the Palace "coup" </p><p>of October 2002, and is "in league with India against </p><p>China."  Bhattarai also mentions Ambassador Malinowski by </p><p>name, and alleges that he has been "lobbying to </p><p>rationalize the royal coup." </p><p> </p><p>Threats, Couched in Jargon </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Though couched in thick ideological jargon, </p><p>Bhattarai\'s tone is unmistakably threatening, as when he </p><p>says, "in the coming days revolution and counter- </p><p>revolution can be logically foreseen to clash with </p><p>greater intensity and ferocity."  And, more frankly, "it </p><p>is but natural to centralize one\'s forces for the </p><p>decisive battle."  Using the rhetoric of anachronistic </p><p>Marxism, he speaks of the "historical necessity" of his </p><p>movement, and of the "materialist dialectics" that </p><p>determine the conflict between revolution and counter- </p><p>revolution.  Orthodox Marxism describes three stages of </p><p>protracted war:  strategic defensive, strategic stalemate </p><p>and strategic offensive.  Bhattarai has already claimed </p><p>that "a situation of strategic stalemate has developed" </p><p>(Ref D).  [Note:  Nepal\'s Chief of Army Staff (COAS) also </p><p>recently told us that the conflict has reached a "50-50 </p><p>stalemate" (Ref B).  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Preparing to Up the Anted </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) In early December, there were signs that the </p><p>Maoists were feigning a strategic cease-fire.  In a </p><p>December press release (Ref F), Prachanda pledged to </p><p>cease attacks on non-military infrastructure the cadres </p><p>of other political parties.  Events quickly proved this </p><p>promise hollow, as the number and ferocity of attacks on </p><p>such targets continued unabated (Ref E).  Evidence exists </p><p>that the Maoists are preparing to raise the ante even </p><p>more.  A vernacular Nepali-language weekly reported in </p><p>late November that a group of South Asian extremists, </p><p>including Nepali Maoists, in early October formed a </p><p>committee for "World Peoples\' Retaliation Agitation" in </p><p>South Asia (Ref C).  [Note:  Post has been unable to </p><p>confirm the veracity of this report, although Indian </p><p>intelligence officers pooh-poohed the notion that such an </p><p>alliance would pose a threat.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Comment:  Intransigence, Belligerence and Revolution </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Judging both from the Maoists\' rhetoric and their </p><p>behavior, their position will not soften in coming </p><p>months, and they will seize every opportunity, including </p><p>negotiations or cease-fires, to gain advantage.  Some of </p><p>the Maoist rhetoric about dialogue seems calculated to </p><p>influence foreign audiences, including the U.S., in order </p><p>to discourage putting the Maoists on any terrorist list. </p><p>We are convinced, furthermore, that the Maoists will not </p><p>approach peace negotiations in good faith unless and </p><p>until they come under substantial, sustained pressure </p><p>from security forces.  Faced with an increasing spiral of </p><p>violence, Nepal\'s government has had difficulty rooting </p><p>out the Maoists, and the insurgents\' recent statements </p><p>show them at their most intransigent and belligerent. </p><p>Framed by the jargon of mid-twentieth-century Marxism, </p><p>their claim to stand on principle stems both from their </p><p>attempt to occupy the moral high ground and from textbook </p><p>guerrilla tactics.  As the Maoists have learned from </p><p>insurgencies elsewhere, to the extent that they can </p><p>instill chaos, confusion and disorder, they will gain the </p><p>upper hand.  We expect the Maoists to continue to pursue </p><p>their strategic aims with single-minded determination, </p><p>employing terror and duplicity as their tactics. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
