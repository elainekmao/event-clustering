<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005595 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KPAL, PREL, PGOV, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIANS CRITICAL OF U.S. AND ARAB POSITIONS ON </p><p>THE MUQATTA SIEGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  When Poloff recently queried a number of Jordanian </p><p>contacts about the Muqatta siege, most had surprisingly </p><p>little sympathy for Arafat, but quite a bit of antipathy for </p><p>U.S. "acquiescence" in the Israeli actions and Arab leaders\' </p><p>lethargic response to the situation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>PEOPLE PROTESTING THEIR OWN PLIGHT, NOT ARAFAT\'S </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) There is wide-spread criticism in Jordan of the </p><p>Israeli siege of Muqatta and wide-spread belief that Israel </p><p>would not take such steps without at least tacit U.S. </p><p>approval.  Arab states are also taking some of the heat for </p><p>the current stand-off.  One contact complained that the Arab </p><p>states had not done anything for the Palestinians since the </p><p>Beirut Summit.  Former Royal Court Advisor Adnan Abu Odeh </p><p>pointed to a recent segment on Al-Jazeira, where an elderly </p><p>Palestinian woman cursed both Sharon and the Arab leaders for </p><p>their current state.  Abu Odeh cautioned that this was </p><p>emblematic of Arab feelings, "the Arab leaders are silently </p><p>watching the Palestinians...this equalizes them with Sharon </p><p>in the minds of people." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The siege of Arafat has generated little sympathy for </p><p>the Palestinian leader from our Jordanian contacts.  Many </p><p>contacts argued that the Palestinian protesters in the West </p><p>Bank and Gaza were protesting their own plight, not Arafat\'s. </p><p> Ghazi al-Sa\'di, owner of the al-Jalil publishing house, said </p><p>that the Palestinian protesters were demonstrating for their </p><p>own dignity, and not for Arafat the person.  Abu Odeh  opined </p><p>that "people also hit the streets because they were looking </p><p>for an opportunity to get out of the house"--a reference to </p><p>the Israeli-imposed curfews.  Most contacts scoffed at </p><p>Israel\'s attempt to link the siege to counterterrorism </p><p>measures.  One contact said "what Sharon is doing is going to </p><p>convince the Palestinians to support Hamas, instead of </p><p>Arafat." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) One contact, who has not shown a great deal of </p><p>sympathy for Palestinians in the past, was extremely critical </p><p>of the Israeli destruction of Palestinian Authority </p><p>buildings, and believed Sharon\'s intentions were even more </p><p>nefarious.  "Sharon is destroying the Palestinian </p><p>infrastructure, not only the Palestinian Authority." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>PALESTINIAN REFORM MUST GO ON </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Abu Odeh, an avowed Arafat critic, pleaded to Poloff </p><p>that the U.S. must not allow the siege to derail Palestinian </p><p>reform.  "You must not allow Arafat to run in elections.  If </p><p>his is reelected, his people will feel validated."  Abu Odeh </p><p>urged that a constitution be drafted as soon as possible, </p><p>naming Arafat as a symbolic President, and spelling out </p><p>elections for Prime Minister."  When asked how Arafat could </p><p>be persuaded to accept this, Abu Odeh responded that Egyptian </p><p>and Saudi mediators need to "put it in clear terms for </p><p>him--it\'s either a symbolic role or exile.  Arafat is a </p><p>tactician; if he only has two choices, then he will chose the </p><p>symbolic role."  Abu Odeh, whose extended family resides in </p><p>Nabulus, told Poloff that Arafat has the support of his </p><p>cronies and some support in the camps, but little support in </p><p>the cities.  Abu Odeh also talked at length about the </p><p>debilitating effect of the curfew on Nabulus and urged the </p><p>U.S. to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground to </p><p>encourage Palestinian participation in reform and elections. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The siege of Muqatta has once again raised questions </p><p>here not just about Israeli treatment of Arafat or </p><p>Palestinians in general (which Jordanians assume will be </p><p>bad), but about the commitment of the U.S. and Arab leaders </p><p>to an eventual resolution of the conflict. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
