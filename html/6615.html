<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000694 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; EAP/RSP; INL/AAE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, SNAR, ETRD, MARR, BM, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  THAN SHWE VISIT: CLOSE BUT NOT "TRADITIONAL" FRIENDS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  02 Hanoi 1279 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  The visit by Than Shwe, Senior General </p><p>and Chairman of Burma\'s State Peace and Development Council </p><p>(SPDC), focused on trying to enhance the modest economic </p><p>relationship of these two fellow ASEAN states.  Narcotics </p><p>were apparently not on the agenda; however, the two sides </p><p>pledged cooperation in tourism, health, and education as </p><p>well as reaffirmed cooperation in other areas such as </p><p>military-to-military ties; counterterrorism; and crime.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Than Shwe visited Vietnam from March 14-16 at the </p><p>invitation of Vietnam\'s President Tran Duc Luong.  This was </p><p>his third visit to Vietnam, having previously come in 1995 </p><p>and 1998 (the latter for the Sixth ASEAN Summit).  President </p><p>Luong visited Burma in May 2002 (reftel).  Other prior GVN </p><p>visits included:  then-Communist Party of Vietnam General </p><p>Secretary Do Muoi (1997); then-Deputy Prime Minister and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam (1998); and, Prime Minister </p><p>Phan Van Khai (2000). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  According to media accounts, Than Shwe\'s entourage </p><p>consisted of a variety of officials, including: </p><p>--SPDC Secretary and Lieutenant General Soe Win; </p><p>--Chairman of the Peace and Development Council (PDC) </p><p>Mandalay Division and Commander of the Central Military </p><p>Command Major General Ye Myint; </p><p>--Chairman of the Sagaing Division of the PDC and Commander </p><p>of the Northwest Military Zone Major General Soe Naing; </p><p>--Agriculture and Irrigation Minister Major General Nyunt </p><p>Tin; </p><p>--Industry Minister U Aung Thaung; </p><p>--Commerce Minister Brigadier General Pyi Sone; </p><p>--Foreign Minister U Win Aung; </p><p>--Livestock Breeding and Fisheries Minister Brigadier </p><p>General Maung Maung Thein; </p><p>--Energy Minister Brigadier General Lun Thi; </p><p>--Health Minister Professor Dr. Kyaw Myint; </p><p>--Military Assistant to the SPDC Chairman, Major General Ne </p><p>Win; </p><p>--Director General of the SPDC Office, Lieutenant Colonel Pe </p><p>Nyein; and, </p><p>--an unspecified number of "entrepreneurs." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Than Shwe\'s activities followed a typical pattern </p><p>for ceremonial visits:  mutual compliments about each </p><p>country\'s accomplishments ("President Luong renewed </p><p>Vietnam\'s support to the Myanmar Government\'s efforts to </p><p>maintain territorial integrity and national reconciliation </p><p>and unity. . ."); meetings with Prime Minister Khai, </p><p>President Luong, and National Assembly Chairman Nguyen Van </p><p>An; a courtesy call with Communist Party of Vietnam General </p><p>Secretary Nong Duc Manh; a banquet; a wreath laying ceremony </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum; and a joint communiqu summing </p><p>up the visit. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The Burma Embassy and the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Asia II Department declined our requests for </p><p>briefings on the visit.  However, Luan Thuy Duong, Deputy </p><p>Director of the Department for Southeast Asian Studies at </p><p>the MFA\'s Institute of International Relations (IIR), </p><p>described the Vietnam - Burma relationship to poloff on </p><p>March 18 as "excellent."  Duong noted that Burma had been </p><p>one of the first countries to establish relations with </p><p>Vietnam following the end of the Vietnam - US War.  Burma </p><p>opened its embassy in Hanoi in May 1975, less than a month </p><p>after reunification.  Vietnam\'s leaders also "highly valued" </p><p>Burma\'s "spiritual support" during the war, she claimed. </p><p>Duong said that the relationship as "not quite traditional, </p><p>but very close."  (Note:  Vietnam reserves the term </p><p>"traditional" for its oldest friends, such as Cuba and </p><p>Russia.  End note.)  Duong noted that, while Than Shwe was </p><p>able to fulfill his itinerary in Hanoi, he appeared "rather </p><p>old and frail." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>ECONOMICS:  MOSTLY TALK </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Reports in Vietnam\'s state controlled media </p><p>emphasized the economic focus of the visit, trumpeting that </p><p>two-way trade had increased 300 percent between 1998 and </p><p>2002.  However, the respective figures were only USD four </p><p>million and USD 12 million.  The GVN\'s stated goal is to </p><p>reach a two-way trade level of USD 30 million by 2005.  The </p><p>IIR\'s Duong admitted that even this modest figure is </p><p>"probably not feasible."  Duong noted that Burma\'s economy </p><p>is "quite weak, with difficult structural problems."  In </p><p>addition, "payment mechanisms" need to be developed; Duong </p><p>predicted that the two sides "must look more at barter </p><p>trading."  Aside from some gems and timber, Burma "does not </p><p>have much" to offer Vietnam, she added.  Without citing </p><p>specifics, Duong predicted that the bilateral focus would </p><p>remain on economics during 2003, including exchanges between </p><p>the two Ministries of Trade. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MILITARY-TO-MILITARY </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Duong noted that the leaders had discussed </p><p>military-to-military cooperation, which she characterized as </p><p>"quite smooth."  Duong admitted that while she was not </p><p>knowledgeable about the details of the military-to-military </p><p>activity, but noted that there are "regular meetings" </p><p>between senior military officers as well as some officer </p><p>exchanges.  Duong predicted additional senior level military </p><p>visits from both sides during 2003. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>OTHER AREAS OF COOPERATION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Similar to exchanges during President Luong\'s </p><p>visit last May (reftel), both sides pledged further </p><p>cooperation in a number of areas, such as tourism, </p><p>education, culture, forestry, and agriculture.  The IIR\'s </p><p>Duong said that, while the relevant ministers had discussed </p><p>ways to promote progress in these areas, "there are not yet </p><p>very many concrete programs."  Specifically relating to </p><p>tourism, Duong opined that Vietnamese and Burmese companies </p><p>could "join forces" to promote tour packages for foreigners </p><p>to visit both countries. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>ASEAN CONTEXT </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  According to the media, President Luong told his </p><p>guests that Vietnam and Burma should view the visit as an </p><p>opportunity to improve not only the bilateral relationship, </p><p>but also cooperation within the ASEAN framework.  Duong said </p><p>that this was very much in line with the GVN\'s desire to </p><p>increase cooperation among the "new ASEAN" members - </p><p>Cambodia, Laos, Burma, and Vietnam -- both on a bilateral </p><p>and multilateral basis, which she labeled a "parallel </p><p>approach."  Duong claimed that the "lower tier" members </p><p>feared being "disadvantaged" economically by the wealthier </p><p>members as they move into free trade arrangements.  Duong </p><p>commented that Than Shwe\'s visit could be viewed as an </p><p>attempt by Vietnam to solidify bilateral relations while at </p><p>the same time strengthening the ASEAN subcontext. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>DRUG ISSUE NOT ON THE AGENDA </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Although Vietnam is a transit point for Golden </p><p>Triangle heroin, narcotics were also not raised during the </p><p>visit, according to Duong.  This was probably because the </p><p>two sides had agreed that the visit\'s focus should be mostly </p><p>on trade and economics issues, she opined.  Duong also noted </p><p>that Vietnam and Burma have an existing MOU for drug </p><p>cooperation and that they have agreed in the past to </p><p>cooperate both through this agreement as well as within the </p><p>ASEAN framework.  Duong added that both sides discuss drugs </p><p>"on an ongoing basis" during other "appropriate" official </p><p>visits. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>STANDING AGAINST TERRORISM </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Duong highlighted that the leaders had agreed on </p><p>the need to continue to cooperate against terrorism. </p><p>According to the joint communiqu, Vietnam and Burma will </p><p>"strengthen information exchanges" relating to terrorism. </p><p>While the joint communiqu also stated that both sides </p><p>intend to sign an anti-crime agreement, Duong declined to </p><p>predict when this might occur. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  While Vietnam and Burma are clearly interested in </p><p>moving forward on the bilateral relationship, these ties are </p><p>likely to remain subsumed in the more important ASEAN </p><p>context.  Despite considerable public cheerleading, a </p><p>significant increase in trade is not realistic.  In both the </p><p>Luong visit last May and this visit, it is encouraging to </p><p>see a strong stand against terrorism, in line with recent </p><p>trends in ASEAN.  It is notable, also, that the leaders made </p><p>no public reference to Iraq. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p>T </p><p></p></div>
