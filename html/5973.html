<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000331 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  02-27-13 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, CE, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  Human rights update:  GSL pursues human rights </p><p>cases, LTTE shows halting human rights improvements </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Colombo 147 and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Although the Sri Lankan government </p><p>continues to pursue human rights cases through its </p><p>judicial system, reports of torture in custody continue. </p><p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), meanwhile, </p><p>is doing little to improve its human rights record.  The </p><p>high visibility issue of the LTTE recruiting children </p><p>remains an issue despite promises to the contrary.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GSL </p><p>=== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Sri Lankan government continues to pursue a </p><p>number of high profile human rights related court cases, </p><p>including: </p><p> </p><p>Mirusuvil Massacre Case:  The case centers on the </p><p>abduction of 9 Tamil civilians by Sri Lanka Army </p><p>personnel.  Eight of the Tamils abducted were killed and </p><p>five soldiers are charged with their murders.  The most </p><p>recent hearing was on February 17.  During the hearing </p><p>the sole survivor of nine Tamil civilians that had been </p><p>abducted gave testimony of events prior to his escape. </p><p>Fifty-six further witnesses are scheduled to testify. </p><p> </p><p>Bindunuwewa Massacre Case:  In October 2000, 27 Tamils </p><p>held at the Bindunuwewa rehabilitation camp for former </p><p>child soldiers were killed while police allegedly looked </p><p>on.  In May 2001, a court case against 51 suspects began </p><p>with the reading of 83 charges.  The next court hearing </p><p>is scheduled for March 10.  In conjunction with the </p><p>hearing, the court has agreed to accept written </p><p>submissions of testimony by the accused. </p><p> </p><p>Kandy Election Day Killings:  Anuruddha Ratwatte, the </p><p>former Defense Minister and a relative of President </p><p>Kumaratunga, along with his two sons and thirteen other </p><p>defendants, including security force personnel, have </p><p>been accused of murdering ten Muslim campaign workers on </p><p>election day December 5, 2001.  Ratwatte allegedly </p><p>directed the killings.  The trial-at-bar into this case </p><p>has been hearing testimony for the past two weeks and is </p><p>scheduled to continue on a daily basis until all </p><p>evidence has been presented.  On February 17 Commander </p><p>of the Army Lt. General Lionel Balagalle testified on </p><p>behalf of the prosecutors, claiming that Ratwatte was </p><p>using soldiers for his personal gain.  (Note:  A trial- </p><p>at-bar replaces a jury with three high court judges with </p><p>the intended effect of speeding up the trial process and </p><p>limiting the possibility of harassing witnesses.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Human rights observers are reporting that Anton </p><p>Michael, a local human rights activist was assaulted by </p><p>prison guards while he was in custody.  While attending </p><p>court for another issue on February 6, Michael was </p><p>reportedly found in contempt of court and sentenced to </p><p>one-year imprisonment.  He reportedly suffered spinal </p><p>injuries at the hands of the prison guards on February </p><p>10.  The Minister of Interior and the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>office have ordered investigations into the incident. </p><p>Prison officials have claimed that Michael attacked the </p><p>prison guards and was injured when they had to </p><p>forcefully subdue him. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On October 20, 2002 Ranjith Karunaratne died </p><p>under questionable circumstances while being transported </p><p>to a police station.  He was arrested for his alleged </p><p>involvement in theft rings.  On February 19 six police </p><p>officers were arrested by the Criminal Investigation </p><p>Division (CID) for their alleged involvement in </p><p>Karunaratne\'s death. </p><p> </p><p>LTTE </p><p>==== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) During the fifth round of peace talks, held in </p><p>Berlin, the LTTE agreed to work with UNICEF to end child </p><p>recruitment.  In reference to this agreement, on </p><p>February 20 Inspector General of Police T.E. Anandarajah </p><p>announced that the LTTE have released 110 children of </p><p>the 136 reported abducted between April 2002 and January </p><p>2003.  Deputy Head of the ICRC Delegation Catherine </p><p>Gendre stated, however, that the press statement just </p><p>reviewed old cases and only covered a fraction of the </p><p>cases reported in other sources.  The SLMM, for example, </p><p>received reports of almost 600 abduction cases during </p><p>that time frame.  In addition, indications are that the </p><p>LTTE continues to forcibly recruit children in eastern </p><p>Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The LTTE also continues to detain two Sri Lankan </p><p>Security Force Personnel.  The LTTE has permitted the </p><p>ICRC to meet with the soldier on one occasion.  The ICRC </p><p>has not yet been able to meet with the police officer, </p><p>despite its request to do so.  Hagrup Haukland, Deputy </p><p>Head of Mission for the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission has </p><p>been in regular contact with the LTTE on its detention </p><p>of the two Sri Lankan security force personnel, and has </p><p>repeatedly urged the LTTE to release the captives.  He </p><p>stated that the LTTE recently agreed to release the two </p><p>in the near future and that based on similar promises in </p><p>the past he expects that the two will likely be released </p><p>within the next two to three days.  The LTTE has been </p><p>holding the soldier since December 24, 2002 and the </p><p>police officer since February 20. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The cases reviewed above show a trend that more </p><p>and more human rights observers are commenting on in </p><p>Colombo.  While the GSL has a fair share of human rights </p><p>related problems, particularly torture in police </p><p>custody, it is taking steps to address the issues.  At </p><p>the same time, the LTTE is making positive </p><p>pronouncements on its intentions to abide by </p><p>international human rights standards, but has yet to </p><p>deliver on many of those promises.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
