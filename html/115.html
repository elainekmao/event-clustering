<p>S E C R E T MOGADISHU 03219 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PINS, PREL, LY, IR, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRANIAN AND LIBYAN TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  LIBYAN TERRORISM:  EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR MEKKY </p><p>(PROTECT SOURCE) TOLD ME MARCH 24 THAT HE UNDERSTOOD </p><p>THAT THE RECENT LIBYAN PUBLIC RECRUITMENT DRIVE </p><p>(MOGADISHU 3124) HAD RESULTED IN THE SUCCESSFUL </p><p>RECRUITMENT OF ABOUT 40 SOMALIS, WHO LEFT MOGADISHU </p><p>SUPPOSEDLY FOR DESTINATIONS IN THE GULF BUT ACTUALLY </p><p>TO GO ON TO LIBYA FOR TRAINING.  MEKKY\'S UNDERSTANDING </p><p>WAS THAT QADHAFI WAS INTENDING TO PUT THESE AND </p><p>OTHER FOREIGN RECRUITS INTO A KIND OF SUICIDE BATTA- </p><p>LION TO BE TARGETTED AGAINST AMERICANS IN THE EVENT </p><p>OF HOSTILITIES IN THE GULF OF SIDRA.  (NOTE:  WE WOULD </p><p>APPRECITE RECEIVING ANY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>LIBYAN IDEA BEHIND THE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, WHICH WE </p><p>GATHER WERE UNDERTAKEN BY THE LIBYANS AS FAR AFIELD </p><p>AS AUSTRALIA.)   MEKKY ADDED THAT EGYPTIAN INFORMATION </p><p>WAS THAT OF THE 12 PRESENT MEMBERS OF THE LIBYAN </p><p>PEOPLE\'S BUREAU HERE, EIGHT WERE TERRORISTS.  HIS </p><p>FEELING WAS THAT THE LIBYANS MIGHT NOT INTEND ANY </p><p>EARLY TERRORIST ACTION IN MOGADISHU, AND HE HOPED </p><p>THAT THEY MIGHT BE DISSUADED FROM ACTION AGAINST HIS </p><p>EMBASSY BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED THE CHILDREN </p><p>OF THE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO LIBYANS IN THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN SCHOOL, PLUS THE FACT THAT A COUPLE OF THE </p><p>LIBYANS HAD BEEN EDUCATED IN EGYPT.  HOWEVER, HE </p><p>CONTINUED, LIBYAN OFFICIALS WOULD PRESUMABLY CARRY OUT </p><p>ORDERS, NO MATTER WHERE THEY HAD BEEN EDUCATED. </p><p>HE SAID THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE ANY ATTACK ON HIS </p><p>PEOPLE HERE, HE HAD ORDERED THAT THE LIBYAN CHILDREN </p><p>BE BROUGHT FOR "SAFEKEEPING" DIRECT FROM THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>SCHOOL TO THE EGYPTIAN CHANCERY. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  IRANIAN TERRORISM:  MEKKY SHARED WITH ME A CAIRO </p><p>REPORT THAT NORTH KOREAN INSTRUCTORS HAD BEEN CONDUCTING </p><p>TERRORIST TRAINING AT A MILITARY INSTALLATION IN IRAN, </p><p>AND THAT 40 SUCH IRANIAN TRAINEES, OF WHOM 11 WERE </p><p>WOMEN, HAD LEFT TEHERAN EARLY ON THE MORNING OF </p><p>JANUARY 15 BY MILITARY AIRCRAFT FOR AN UNKNOWN DESTINA- </p><p>TION.  THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY HAD SHARED THIS INFORMA- </p><p>TION WITH SOMALI SECURITY OFFICIALS ON MARCH 8; THERE </p><p>WAS NO INDICATION THAT ANY OF THE IRANIANS HAD COME </p><p>TO SOMALIA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  RE PARA 2, THE SOMALI AUTHORITIES DID </p><p>THEIR UTMOST TO COUNTER THE LIBYAN RECRUITMENT EFFORTS </p><p>AND WE ARE SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL AS MANY AS 40 RECRUITED </p><p>SOMALIS HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY.  NOR HAVE WE BEEN ABLE </p><p>TO CONFIRM THAT AS MANY AS 8 OF THE 12 LIBYAN </p><p>"DIPLOMATS" HERE ARE TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIDGES </p><p></p></div>
