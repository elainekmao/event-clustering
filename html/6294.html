<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR CALLED TO MFA OVER NEW SANCTIONS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Ambassador Sullivan was called to a meeting on </p><p>March 11 by Ambassador Joey Bimha, Divisional Head - Europe </p><p>and America, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Although </p><p>Ambassador Bimha would not disclose the purpose of the </p><p>meeting in advance, after a few courtesies he immediately </p><p>asked for an explanation of the Executive Order of March 7 </p><p>targeting financial assets of President Mugabe and 76 other </p><p>GOZ officials.  Ambassador Sullivan explained the Executive </p><p>Order, restated the prevailing American concern about </p><p>continued violations of human and civil rights, and </p><p>delivered a copy of the text. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Ambassador Bimha stated that he and his ministry </p><p>were open to dialogue and expressed the hope that dialogue </p><p>would somehow lead to an end to the current political </p><p>impasse.  However, when discussing the possibility of </p><p>dialogue with the opposition party Movement for Democratic </p><p>Change (MDC), he blamed the opposition party for the </p><p>breakdown in inter-party dialogue.  He remained adamant that </p><p>no dialogue was possible as long as the MDC continued to </p><p>pursue its court challenge of the 2002 presidential </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment.  The most significant aspect of this </p><p>conversation was Ambassador Bimha\'s expressions of surprise </p><p>that economic sanctions had finally been imposed.  Despite a </p><p>year\'s worth of USG and international censure of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>human rights violations, civil rights violations, </p><p>humanitarian catastrophe, economic implosion, political </p><p>crisis, and despite frequent USG warnings of impending </p><p>financial sanctions, the diplomat feigned astonishment that </p><p>the USG\'s clearly stated intentions had finally matured into </p><p>explicit action.  This also fits with the slowness of GOZ </p><p>reaction to USG financial sanctions.  Except for an </p><p>anonymous GOZ official\'s claim to Reuters International that </p><p>the sanctions were a white racist reaction to land </p><p>redistribution, the US financial sanctions went unreported </p><p>and without comment in the state media until the night of </p><p>Tuesday, March 11.  The explanations given that US sanctions </p><p>were somehow a favor to the British and a part of Iraq </p><p>policy were bizarre.  How to explain GOZ wrong-footedness? </p><p>Perhaps they have been reading too much of their own </p><p>propaganda that the French invitation to Mugabe and South </p><p>African/Nigerian advocacy for ending Commonwealth sanctions </p><p>were great Zimbabwean triumphs signaling the accommodation </p><p>of the world to Zimbabwean reality.  Oh well -- back to the </p><p>drawing board.  End comment. </p><p></p></div>
