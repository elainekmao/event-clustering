(D) 01 KATHMANDU 1615 </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) In a joint public statement May 20, nine left-wing </p><p>opposition parties criticized Maoist tactics and called for </p><p>the insurgents to "reinstate their credibility" by initiating </p><p>a unilateral ceasefire.  Eight of the parties--only three of </p><p>which have Members in Parliament--asked Opposition Leader and </p><p>CPN-UML General Secretary Madhav Nepal not to support a </p><p>six-month extension of the emergency (Ref B); Nepal remains </p><p>undecided.  A press release issued by Maoist leader Prachanda </p><p>the same day asserted attacks against infrastructure violate </p><p>the party\'s "central policies" and promised a "probe" of any </p><p>infractions.  While acknowledging some "weaknesses in our </p><p>past," the Maoist leader charged that much of the violence </p><p>attributed to his cadres was committed by the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA).  The translated text of Prachanda\'s statement </p><p>follows in Para 5 below.  Whether Prachanda\'s disavowal of </p><p>the attacks on infrastructure is just another example of </p><p>Maoist dissembling or is instead an indication of the </p><p>much-rumored rift in leadership remains unclear.  What seems </p><p>certain, however, is that no one--especially no one in the </p><p>Government--is likely to take the Maoist supremo\'s </p><p>representations seriously.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>LEFT-WING PARTIES CONDEMN MAOIST VIOLENCE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Nine left-wing parties, including the leading </p><p>Opposition Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(UML), met May 20 to discuss the Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>bid to extend the state of emergency for another six months </p><p>(Ref B).  The parties issued a joint public statement </p><p>strongly condemning Maoist tactics of murder, abduction, and </p><p>destruction of infrastructure and calling on the insurgents </p><p>to lay down their arms.  While asserting the need for a </p><p>peaceful resolution to the current crisis, the statement </p><p>called on the Maoists to "reinstate their credibility" and </p><p>demonstrate their sincerity in pursuing dialogue by </p><p>initiating a unilateral ceasefire, according to Arun Nepal, </p><p>Secretary of the UML\'s International Department. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In the same meeting, eight of the parties appealed </p><p>to Opposition Leader and UML General Secretary Madhav Nepal </p><p>not to support an extension of the emergency in the special </p><p>Parliamentary session scheduled to begin May 23. (Note: </p><p>Three of the eight parties have a total of seven Members in </p><p>Parliament, all of whom voted against ratification of the </p><p>emergency in February.  The remaining five parties have no </p><p>seats in Parliament.  Since a two-thirds majority of MPs </p><p>present is needed to extend the emergency, UML support--or, </p><p>at a minimum, lack of opposition--is crucial to the GON\'s </p><p>effort.  End note.)  Nepal has not yet indicated openly how </p><p>his party will vote. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>PRACHANDA RESPONDS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In an apparent response to the left parties\' </p><p>statement, Maoist leader Prachanda later issued a press </p><p>release dated the same day.  While asserting some "sabotage" </p><p>is necessary to further the movement\'s revolutionary ends, </p><p>the statement flatly denies that destruction of </p><p>infrastructure and personal residences is an accepted tactic </p><p>of the insurgents.  (Note:  Torture, murder, and kidnapping, </p><p>however, are not mentioned as unacceptable.  End note.)  Most </p><p>of the destruction attributed to the Maoists was in fact </p><p>carried out by the Royal Nepal Army (RNA), the broadside </p><p>charges, in order to discredit the movement.  Acknowledging </p><p>the possibility of "weaknesses in the past," however, </p><p>Prachanda promises to launch a "probe" into any such </p><p>infractions.  An unofficial translation of the press release </p><p>follows in Para 5 below. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Begin text of unofficial translation: </p><p> </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) </p><p>Central Committee </p><p>Press Statement </p><p> </p><p>   The fact that the feudal tyrannical elements under the </p><p>instructions of their imperialist masters are plotting yet </p><p>another conspiracy against Nepal and the Nepalese people has </p><p>become clear with their dramatic attempt of extending the </p><p>so-called emergency.   Although it is clear that the whole </p><p>country favors a positive political way out through dialogue </p><p>and talks, this attempt, the wish of the so-called Royal </p><p>Army, has made a mockery of  parliamentary norms.   It has </p><p>further bolstered our conclusion that all of our fellow </p><p>political parties of the 1990 people,s movement should unite </p><p>and resist feudal despotism.  Despite a string of murders, </p><p>robberies, bombings and rumors over the last six months, </p><p>Maoist fighters have overrun the so-called Royal Army in real </p><p>battles.  This new attempt to extend the emergency just </p><p>proves that. </p><p> </p><p>In this situation, a historic responsibility has arisen once </p><p>again before all political powers, including the ones in </p><p>Parliament, to learn from past mistakes and take initiatives </p><p>against despotic interests.  It is clear that as the Royal </p><p>Army terror became unrestrained nationwide with the </p><p>ratification of the emergency in Parliament, we protested </p><p>with various struggle programs, including the five-day Nepal </p><p>bandh.  Our attention has been drawn to the questions raised </p><p>about various sabotage actions then.  The first thing we want </p><p>to make clear here is that that it is internationally proved </p><p>that sabotage, as a part of resistance and insurgency against </p><p>feudal tyranny, is necessary and justified to a certain </p><p>extent to weaken the economic and military interests of the </p><p>enemy.  The second thing, we cannot even think of destroying </p><p>the institutions related to such basic needs of people,s </p><p>lives as health, education and drinking water or setting </p><p>peoples, houses on fire.  The party considers such </p><p>activities against its central policies.  The party is </p><p>committed to launch a probe into such activities and take </p><p>strong action based on the nature of the offenses.  We would </p><p>like to appeal to all to consider this fact seriously.   In </p><p>the meantime, under the planned conspiracy, there have been </p><p>countless crimes, including plain-clothes Royal Army and </p><p>Police personnel in the name of Maoists setting peoples, </p><p>houses on fire, cutting off drinking water pipes, looting and </p><p>committing destructive activities in order to defame our </p><p>party and the movement.  The burning of 102 houses in </p><p>Thawang, Rolpa has been the latest conspiracy to slander us. </p><p>Finally, with the commitment to correcting our weaknesses in </p><p>the past and revealing the facts about the destruction caused </p><p>by the enemy to defame this movement, we appeal to all </p><p>political forces, intellectuals and the public to unite </p><p>against the so-called emergency imposed by feudal elements. </p><p> </p><p>Date: May 20, 2002                              Prachanda </p><p>                                          President </p><p>                                          NCP (Maoist) </p><p>                                          Central Committee </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Members of left-wing parties met with Maoist </p><p>leaders in India as recently as last August (Ref D).  Since </p><p>then, however, the Maoists have unilaterally backed out of </p><p>dialogue, broken a ceasefire, and engaged in a killing spree </p><p>that nowadays includes members of these same parties in </p><p>addition to their more traditional Nepali Congress targets. </p><p>The insurgents had already earned nearly universal </p><p>condemnation for carrying out attacks on village-level </p><p>infrastructure, such as drinking water programs and </p><p>mini-hydropower schemes.  But their latest attack on a </p><p>Surkhet orphanage (Ref A), many believe, is a new low and may </p><p>well have prompted this united left rebuke.  Prachanda\'s </p><p>disavowal of tactics adopted by his cadres throughout the </p><p>country could be another indication of the much-rumored rift </p><p>in the Maoist leadership between the political and militant </p><p>wings.  On the other hand, the leader\'s statement could be no </p><p>more than pre-emergency debate political posturing--just as </p><p>his counterparts in the UML and the Nepali Congress are so </p><p>predictably doing.  In any event, no one--especially no one </p><p>in the Government--is likely to take either Prachanda\'s </p><p>purported commitment to correct his party\'s "weaknesses" or </p><p>his pledge to probe violations seriously. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
