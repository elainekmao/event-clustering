<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 009640 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC KILLS PRIEST, ATTEMPTS TO KIDNAP BISHOP </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON, REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) ON OCTOBER 17, TWO ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN SUCRE AND </p><p>CALDAS DEPARTMENTS WERE ASSASSINATED AND THE FARC IS BELIEVED </p><p>TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THE KILLINGS.  THE </p><p>FIRST MURDER TOOK PLACE IN CHALAN, SUCRE.  (NOTE: SUCRE IS IN </p><p>ONE OF THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION\'S "REHABILITATION ZONES." </p><p>END NOTE.)  PARISH PRIEST JOSE LUIS CARDENAS HERNANDEZ WAS </p><p>GUNNED DOWN AS HE WAS LEAVING HIS RESIDENCE.  SUCRE POLICE </p><p>COMMANDER COLONEL NORMAN LEON ARANGO ATTRIBUTED THE CRIME TO </p><p>THE FARC\'S 35TH FRONT, BUT A SPOKESMAN FOR THE GROUP DENIED </p><p>ANY INVOLVEMENT.  THE SECOND KILLING TOOK PLACE IN ANSERMA, </p><p>CALDAS.  FATHER GABRIEL ARIAS POSADA, A 66 YEAR-OLD PRIEST, </p><p>WAS FOUND SHOT TO DEATH ALONG WITH THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE </p><p>THAT WAS TAKING HIM ON A HUMANITARIAN MISSION.  ARIAS HAD </p><p>REPORTEDLY BEEN TRYING TO SECURE THE LIBERATION OF FORMER </p><p>SENATOR ANCIZAR LOPEZ, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED BY THE FARC SIX </p><p>MONTHS AGO.  POPE JOHN PAUL II CHARACTERIZED THE MURDER OF </p><p>THE TWO PRIESTS AS NEW ACTS OF THE UNJUSTIFIED AND WIDESPREAD </p><p>VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON OCTOBER 20, THE COLOMBIAN ARMY FOILED A PLOT BY THE </p><p>FARC TO KIDNAP FRANCISCO JAVIER MUNERA CORREA, THE ROMAN </p><p>CATHOLIC BISHOP OF FLORENCIA, THE CAPITAL OF CAQUETA </p><p>DEPARTMENT.  AFTER THE ARMY LEARNED OF THE PLOT, BISHOP </p><p>MUNERA WAS MOVED TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION FOR SECURITY </p><p>REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: THE FARC HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE </p><p>VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST RELIGIOUS FIGURES IN COLOMBIA, </p><p>ESPECIALLY ANYONE WHO HAS SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THE FARC\'S </p><p>NUMEROUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.  THE ASSASSINATION IN ONE OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S "REHABILITATION ZONES" MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>DESIGNED TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT THE FARC IS STILL IN </p><p>CHARGE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p></p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
