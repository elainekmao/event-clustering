<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001628 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/EGC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, ENRG, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR FOR ENERGY REQUESTS </p><p>MEETING WITH USG COP-6 BIS DELEGATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 102061 (B) ABUJA 1530 (C) ABUJA 1733 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action cable. Please see para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. On June 22, Ambassador, DOE Energy Advisor, and </p><p>Econoff (notetaker) met with Special Advisor to the </p><p>President for Petroleum Affairs and Energy, Dr. Rilwanu </p><p>Lukman (Reftel B).  Dr. Lukman commented that during </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s state visit to Washington in May, </p><p>Obasanjo promised President Bush that the GON would re- </p><p>evaluate the Kyoto Protocol issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Dr. Lukman said that he will be a member of the </p><p>Nigerian delegation to the upcoming COP-6, and he would </p><p>like to meet with the U.S. delegation.  This meeting </p><p>request is a follow-up to President Obasanjo\'s promise </p><p>to President Bush. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Comment.  Dr. Lukman specifically mentioned an </p><p>upcoming COP-6 meeting at the "Hague."  We assume that he was </p><p>actually referring to the upcoming COP-6 bis meeting to be </p><p>held in Bonn, July 16 - 27.  Within COP negotiations, the GON </p><p>has supported the Kyoto Protocol\'s emission reduction targets </p><p>and has pushed for assistance to developing countries, such </p><p>as technology transfers on a concessionary basis.  (Reftel C </p><p>offers more detail on GON position.)  It is somewhat </p><p>surprising that President Obasanjo and Dr. Lukman have </p><p>expressed a willingess to reconsider Nigeria\'s position; </p><p>such reconsideration will not be well received by other GON </p><p>agencies, such as the Ministry of Environment.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Action Request: Reftel A states that the USG intends </p><p>to send a delegation to COP-6 bis.  Please advise if the </p><p>delegation would like to meet with Dr. Lukman. If so please </p><p>pass the contact details of the U.S. delegation to Post so </p><p>that we can inform Dr. Lukman\'s office. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
