<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001388 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, SA/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PREL, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAOISTS ISSUE PRE-CONDITIONS FOR RESUMPTION </p><p>OF TALKS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  On July 23, the Maoist leadership publicly </p><p>released a letter responding to the Government of Nepal\'s </p><p>invitation to resume formal peace negotiations stalled since </p><p>early May.  Blaming the GON for violations of the cease-fire </p><p>code of conduct, the letter represents another effort to turn </p><p>public opinion against King Gyanendra\'s government and </p><p>against "foreign powers", specifically the United States.  In </p><p>the letter, the Maoists set unrealistic pre-conditions for </p><p>the resumption of peace talks.  Post believes this is a </p><p>continuation of the Maoist strategy of insisting on </p><p>concessions from the GON without having to negotiate.  The </p><p>letter also provided thinly-veiled threats that if the </p><p>pre-conditions are not met, the Maoists will re-initiate its </p><p>campaign of violence and terror.  The GON negotiating team </p><p>has indicated that it would respond as calmly and quickly as </p><p>possible, but that the demands will be difficult to satisfy. </p><p>However, the RNA reportedly has put its forces on heightened </p><p>alert in anticipation of renewed violence.  In sum, by making </p><p>unrealistic demands, the Maoists have brought the cease-fire </p><p>one step closer to collapse.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>The Maoists\' Demands </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 23, the Maoist leadership issued a letter </p><p>signed by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai to Prime Minister Surya </p><p>Bahadur Thapa outlining the conditions the Government of </p><p>Nepal must meet before formal negotiations can resume. </p><p>Specifically, the Maoist letter: </p><p> </p><p>-- (a) Demands that the agreements allegedly reached at the </p><p>second round of talks in May must be implemented before peace </p><p>negotiations can resume.  The insurgents claim that the GON </p><p>had agreed to limit the Royal Nepal Army to within 5 </p><p>kilometers of its barracks, release three Maoist leaders from </p><p>prison, and make public the whereabouts of missing Maoist </p><p>activists.  The GON, however, has denied reaching agreement </p><p>on limiting the RNA\'s movements and, in any case, the RNA has </p><p>flatly refused to comply with such a request as it would give </p><p>the Maoists an enormous tactical advantage should hostilities </p><p>resume.  The letter also claimed that although "all district </p><p>headquarters and large cities" were under RNA control, "the </p><p>rest of the villages and rural areas were under the control </p><p>of the Liberation Army."  As a result, the Maoists state that </p><p>they will regard any RNA or police patrol outside urban areas </p><p>to be a violation of the cease-fire code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>-- (b) Complains that without executive authority, the </p><p>negotiating team is useless and, therefore, the King must </p><p>accord the team full authority before talks can resume. </p><p>-- (c) Demands that the King and political parties must </p><p>reconcile their differences prior to re-initiating </p><p>negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>-- (d) Claims that the RNA has "invited hundreds of U.S. </p><p>military experts and advisors into the country," thereby </p><p>disrupting the peace process.  The letter also refers to the </p><p>RNA as a "foreign puppet military" and likens the Maoist </p><p>insurgency to the 1960s war in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Government Reaction </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 23, Kamal Thapa, Minister of Information and </p><p>member of the GON negotiating team expressed concern to the </p><p>Ambassador about the letter\'s contents, describing it overall </p><p>as "negative."  The local press reports that Thapa felt the </p><p>Maoists\' pre-conditions are "very tough" and would cause a </p><p>delay in the resumption of peace talks.  Thapa noted to the </p><p>Ambassador that the Maoists had also focused attention on the </p><p>U.S. military in Nepal.  He commented that the GON would </p><p>respond as calmly and quickly as possible, perhaps as soon as </p><p>July 24 or 25.  Other sources indicate that the GON already </p><p>has solicited recommendations from RNA and National Police </p><p>leaders.  Senior police officers reportedly suggested that </p><p>the GON response should focus on Maoist violations of the </p><p>cease-fire rather than directly addressing the insurgents\' </p><p>unrealistic demands. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)   Separately, the Chief of Army Staff Pyar Jung Thapa </p><p>also expressed concern over the Maoists\' intentions and </p><p>confided to the Ambassador that he had raised the Army\'s </p><p>alert level.  Press reports indicate that all RNA soldiers on </p><p>leave have been recalled in anticipation of renewed violence. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Indian Ambassador Saran expressed less concern to the </p><p>Ambassador over the letter, seeing it as a likely tactic to </p><p>gain concessions and not necessarily a prelude to terminating </p><p>the talks.  He claimed to have some information from Maoist </p><p>sources indicating that the Maoists wanted the talks to </p><p>continue. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Maoist response to Prime Minister Thapa\'s </p><p>invitation to peace talks represents a continuation of their </p><p>strategy of extracting concessions from the GON without </p><p>entering into formal negotiations.  By all indications, the </p><p>Maoist leadership correctly perceive the more organized and </p><p>structured approach to negotiations of the Thapa government </p><p>as less susceptible to their intimidation and manipulation. </p><p>By setting unrealistic pre-conditions for the resumption of </p><p>talks, the Maoists have set up the peace process for failure. </p><p> Maoist accusations that the GON is "continuously" violating </p><p>the code of conduct are a transparent effort to shift blame </p><p>for a break in the cease-fire to the RNA and National Police. </p><p> In fact, Post\'s assessment is that the Maoists have been </p><p>much more guilty of cease-fire violations than Nepal\'s </p><p>security forces. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Maoist rhetoric against the U.S., while nothing new, </p><p>appeals to Nepali nationalism and politicizes U.S. military </p><p>assistance to Nepal, increasing pressure on the GON to refuse </p><p>such assistance.  The Maoist effort to end U.S. military </p><p>training is further proof that they see our assistance as a </p><p>threat to their political and military objectives.  In sum, </p><p>while the Maoists may be playing some type of brinkmanship </p><p>game to extract concessions, in doing so they have brought </p><p>the cease-fire one step closer to collapse.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
