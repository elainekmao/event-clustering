<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002786 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS TO SECRETARY\'S PARTY </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS TO USTR FOR NOVELLI/SAUMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, KPAL, IS, XF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN REACTS POSITIVELY TO PRESIDENT\'S MAY 9 </p><p>SPEECH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Initial reaction in Jordan to the President\'s May 9 </p><p>speech calling for the establishment within ten years of a </p><p>U.S.-Mideast Free Trade Area has been positive, especially </p><p>among senior government officials.  In a phone conversation </p><p>May 10 with the Ambassador, Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher </p><p>applauded the President, both for his economic message to the </p><p>region and for his clear and direct endorsement of the MEPP. </p><p>On the latter, he noted that while there was, unfortunately, </p><p>no direct reference to the Roadmap, the President\'s personal </p><p>endorsement of the Secretary\'s mission and his explicit </p><p>statement that "the Secretary travels with my commitment" was </p><p>"very strong and very helpful" and constituted an important </p><p>signal of U.S. resolve in the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a separate conversation the same day, Minister of </p><p>Planning Bassam Awadallah was even more enthusiastic about </p><p>the President\'s speech.  Concerning the MEPP, Awadallah </p><p>commented "it was a very serious approach . . . the best </p><p>speech ever by the President on Palestine."  He added that he </p><p>had been "very taken by the seriousness of the President\'s </p><p>commitment to a Palestinian state" as well as the President\'s </p><p>reference to upcoming Jordanian parliamentary elections as an </p><p>important milestone for the region.  Awadallah welcomed the </p><p>President\'s public announcement that Secretary Powell and </p><p>USTR Zoellick will attend the upcoming World Economic Forum </p><p>gathering in Jordan.  He added that he is confident Jordan </p><p>will be competitive in a future Arab free trade area, </p><p>doubting that "others could do what Jordan has done" in </p><p>implementing needed economic reforms. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Awadallah expounded publicly on the benefits he </p><p>foresaw for Jordan in an interview with the local press </p><p>published May 11: "The President\'s initiative will further </p><p>accelerate progress in the Middle East, increase inter-Arab </p><p>trade, creating more jobs and attracting more investments . . </p><p>. We believe in cooperation rather than shortsighted </p><p>competition.  An economically stronger Iraq, an economically </p><p>stronger Syria will also strengthen Jordan."  Underlining his </p><p>belief that Jordan is well-positioned to benefit from the </p><p>President\'s initiative, Awadallah noted "we are well ahead of </p><p>everyone else (in the region).  We pioneered privatization, </p><p>we pioneered intellectual property rights, we are in the </p><p>forefront of liberalization." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In a May 11 editorial, the English-language </p><p>Government-affiliated Jordan Times characterized the </p><p>President\'s initiative as "timely and promising" but </p><p>cautioned that "unless solid foundations for peace are laid, </p><p>free market reforms have few chances.  Peace remains a </p><p>prerequisite for development, prosperity and stability." </p><p>Echoing Awadallah\'s confidence that Jordan would excel in a </p><p>future free trade area, the editorial stated "this </p><p>comparative advantage will always be there." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A quick survey of Embassy contacts also indicate that </p><p>most viewed the President\'s initiative positively, although </p><p>with a few caveats.  The vice chairman of the American </p><p>Chamber of Commerce called it "an excellent idea" though he </p><p>expressed concern that the 10-year timeframe was too long: </p><p>"Can this wait 10 years?  You need to prove to people that </p><p>the U.S. is serious about helping solve their problems now." </p><p>A telecommunications executive called it "the most important </p><p>suggestion anyone has made in the last five years."  He </p><p>noted, however, that "deep political reform must accompany </p><p>economic reform in the region" and added that he "hoped the </p><p>countries of the region would be able to respond </p><p>constructively to the initiative."  Finally, the vice </p><p>chairman of the Amman Chamber of Commerce characterized the </p><p>speech as "very, very good news, especially in the current </p><p>situation.  It shows real U.S. support for the region." </p><p>Representing the views of the business community "old guard" </p><p>that controls the Amman Chamber, he feared that Jordan could </p><p>be negatively affected over time as it loses the comparative </p><p>advantage it currently holds as a result of the U.S.-Jordan </p><p>FTA. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The initial reaction we have heard thus far to the </p><p>President\'s speech has been decidedly positive.  People here </p><p>sense the seriousness of the President\'s tone and the </p><p>commitment it represents, and welcome the U.S.\'s renewed </p><p>focus on resolving the problems of the region.  On top of </p><p>that, the GOJ will certainly relish the opportunity to </p><p>showcase Jordan at the upcoming World Economic Forum </p><p>gathering, in the presence of Secretary Powell and USTR </p><p>Zoellick, as a model for moving the region toward the </p><p>creation of a free trade zone with the U.S. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
