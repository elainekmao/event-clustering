<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000419 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZER </p><p>CAIRO POL FOR MAXSTADT </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, PINS, EFIN, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: BUHARI SAYS NIGERIA NEEDS DISCIPLINE, WANTS </p><p>TO VISIT U.S. BEFORE ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  ABUJA 418 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message contains a recommendation.  See para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) DCM January 31 met with ANPP Presidential candidate </p><p>Mohammadu Buhari and two associates (Bello Abubakar, an aide </p><p>when Buhari was Head of State previously) and Mouftah Baba- </p><p>Ahmed (a businessman and brother to both Nafiu Baba-Ahmed </p><p>(Secretary-General of the Supreme Council for Sharia in </p><p>Nigeria) and Hakeem Baba-Ahmed (Secretary of the Independent </p><p>National Electoral Commission-INEC)).  DCM February 2 met </p><p>separately with Buhari campaign coordinator Sule Hamma. </p><p>Buhari expressed interest in visiting the U.S., while Hamma </p><p>described how Buhari planned to win. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>OBASANJO LACKS CREDIBILITY, HAS BETRAYED HIS 1999 SUPPORTERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Buhari, Baba-Ahmed and Abubakar argued Obasanjo had </p><p>betrayed an electorate that had trusted him to combat </p><p>corruption and instill discipline.  The key to economic </p><p>efficiency and prosperity was to be found in disciplined </p><p>leadership by example (from the top), not in expanded </p><p>privatization.  Nigeria\'s "privatization" program had thus far </p><p>succeeded merely in handing state-owned enterprises over to </p><p>Obasanjo\'s political allies, they said.  A Buhari government </p><p>would focus on rebuilding Nigeria\'s social and physical </p><p>infrastructure, they added.  Asked whether he would support </p><p>the bodies charged with combating corruption, such as the </p><p>Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) and the Code </p><p>of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal, Buhari hedged.  He would </p><p>support all bodies that were "constitutional" but felt that </p><p>Nigeria had plenty of laws on the books to fight corruption; </p><p>again, the problem was lack of disciplined leadership at the </p><p>top and impartial enforcement of existing laws.  COMMENT: The </p><p>constitutionality of the ICPC has survived all challenges to </p><p>date, but at least one case is still pending.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Buhari said he was interested in visiting the U.S. and </p><p>key European countries during a to-be-determined 10-day period </p><p>before the elections.  DCM repeated the message he had given </p><p>to Baba-Ahmed earlier; a visit would be welcome but reception </p><p>at the highest levels was not possible.  Buhari understood and </p><p>said it was essential for Nigeria\'s most important partners to </p><p>get to know and "understand" him.  DCM concurred, noting that </p><p>Buhari had a "formidable" reputation from his earlier stint as </p><p>Head of State.  "Yes, but you know me very well," Buhari </p><p>replied, alluding to an association dating back to 1994. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Recommendation: That Buhari be received by A/S </p><p>Kansteiner should the proposed trip take place.  While other </p><p>candidates may have been received at the DAS level, Buhari is </p><p>a former Head of State and Obasanjo\'s only real opposition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>THE GAME PLAN </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Sule Yahaya Hamma was once Sani Abacha\'s political </p><p>counselor.  Now, he is the coordinator of the Buhari campaign </p><p>organization.  The campaign itself is yet to take off.  Its </p><p>principal had gone on the Hajj and just returned to Nigeria </p><p>with a cold and without a voice.  Notwithstanding this lack of </p><p>domestic campaign activity by the candidate, Hamma professes </p><p>to believe that Buhari will win. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) According to Hamma, Buhari will win by large margins </p><p>all 19 Northern states except Adamawa (VP Atiku Abubakar\'s </p><p>turf) and will get at least 25% of the vote in Adamawa, Ekiti, </p><p>Ondo, Lagos, Anamabra (VP candidate Chuba Okadigbo\'s home), </p><p>one other Southeast state, and four of the six South-South </p><p>states.  Hamma counts on a heavy Northern voter turnout to </p><p>produce the overall margin for victory.  Hamma does not </p><p>perceive a divide between Northern Muslims and Northern </p><p>Christians, arguing that adherents of both religions have </p><p>suffered at the hands of the Obasanjo Administration for their </p><p>regional identities.  He claimed that neither Obasanjo nor </p><p>Atiku understood the depth of antipathy toward the incumbent </p><p>government.  Hamma expressed concern, however, that opening </p><p>ballot boxes and tallying votes in "counting and collation </p><p>centers" would give the ruling PDP the means to rig (by </p><p>switching ballot boxes). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) We have not been able to confirm Hamma\'s allegation </p><p>that INEC plans to establish "counting and collation centers" </p><p>but would agree that offsite tallying increases the risk of </p><p>fraud.  Nonetheless, it is an axiom of Nigerian politics that </p><p>"you only rig where you are strong."  Practically, this means </p><p>that one can inflate vote totals to enhance the margin of the </p><p>candidate favored in a particular area.  One risks unrest, </p><p>however, by announcing a candidate as the winner of an area </p><p>whose voters know they overwhelmingly voted for the other </p><p>contestant.  Rigging to strength can have a net percentage </p><p>effect of near zero nationally if practiced by all.  This </p><p>phenomenon explains why most international observers felt the </p><p>1999 presidential election, though marred by fraud on both </p><p>sides, broadly reflected the will of the Nigerian electorate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Although we cannot rule out a Buhari presidency, it </p><p>does not seem highly likely.  Incumbents have certain inherent </p><p>advantages that challengers need energy and determination to </p><p>overcome.  In Nigeria, they also need a lot of money.  Thus </p><p>far, Buhari has manifested determination but relatively little </p><p>energy, and the funds available to him are unknown but judged </p><p>by most observers as significantly less than the resources </p><p>Obasanjo and Atiku can marshal.  Of course, if Buhari used the </p><p>margins of the Hajj to raise money, his position might now be </p><p>somewhat improved, but Obasanjo and Atiku almost certainly can </p><p>outspend him regardless.  Meanwhile, his campaign remains in </p><p>the starting blocks fully two weeks after the February 13 </p><p>Obasanjo/Atiku launch. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The rationale for a Washington meeting for Buhari has </p><p>more to do with engaging his support base than with engaging </p><p>him.  Many Buhari supporters are deeply suspicious of the USG. </p><p>Buhari has been a Mission contact for many years.  It is in </p><p>our interest now to engage with him at a senior Washington </p><p>level, and to be seen by his supporters as in dialogue with </p><p>him.  History and the nature of Buhari\'s base suggest that a </p><p>Buhari presidency probably would not be as favorably inclined </p><p>toward us as the Obasanjo Administration has been (or would </p><p>be), but Buhari himself could exercise a moderating influence </p><p>on his supporters.  Even if he loses, his influence will </p><p>remain substantial.  Finally, scheduling conflicts  prevented </p><p>Buhari from meeting Andrew Natsios in Nigeria and hearing the </p><p>USAID Administrator\'s message on the importance of non-violent </p><p>elections.  However, the points on the imperative of avoiding </p><p>violence in the upcoming elections were made by the Ambassador </p><p>during a separate meeting with Buhari (Septel). </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
