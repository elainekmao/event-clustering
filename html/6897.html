<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000398 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 3/27/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, BM, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: A DAY OF CONTRASTS AND BOMBS IN RANGOON </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 387 </p><p>     B. RANGOON 388 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ. REASON: 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Armed Forces Day, March 27, saw the </p><p>military government mount its traditional large military </p><p>parade and host a state banquet in the posh Armed Forces </p><p>grand hall and theater.  The pro-democracy parties celebrated </p><p>Anti-Fascist Resistance Day (commemorating the 1945 switch of </p><p>General Aung San\'s Burmese army from the Japanese to the </p><p>Allied camps) with a well-attended gathering in the hall of </p><p>the decrepit NLD national headquarters building.  The </p><p>eventful day included two bombs (see reftels), which killed </p><p>two and injured five.  The devices may have been planted by a </p><p>radical student group frustrated with the lack of progress on </p><p>the return to democracy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Armed Forces Day </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Undeterred by the early morning discovery of a IED in </p><p>a park in central Rangoon, the Burmese military held its </p><p>customary military parade of some 8,000 well-drilled troops. </p><p>Senior General Than Shwe made short remarks to the assembled </p><p>group that included foreign military attaches. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In the evening Than Shwe hosted a black tie gala </p><p>affair for about 400 people, including top military officers, </p><p>government officials, and representatives of the diplomatic </p><p>corps and international organizations.  The dinner and </p><p>cultural show was held in the spacious Armed Forces grand </p><p>hall and theater complex in northern Rangoon. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Senior General Than Shwe looked happy and fit.  One </p><p>of his favorites, General Shwe Mann, once again stood in for </p><p>ailing Vice Senior General Maung Aye.  During the socializing </p><p>period prior to dinner the top four senior generals stood </p><p>apart from the crowd while most invitees were busy exchanging </p><p>greetings with various contacts and friends.  Oddly, almost </p><p>no one approached the four top generals.  After an </p><p>embarrassingly long spell, the ambassador from Singapore went </p><p>up and spoke briefly to General Khin Nyunt. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) After dinner the guests were treated to a cultural </p><p>show performed by the Ministry of Culture troupe.  The </p><p>evening culminated with a musical drama entitled "Brilliant </p><p>Endeavors of King Bayinnaung," introduced by the MC as </p><p> </p><p>"reflections on this beloved king, who, utilizing all his </p><p>physical and mental prowess to advance the well-being of his </p><p>people, with the army\'s help, constructed many roads and </p><p>bridges to tie the land together.  He also propagated the </p><p>Buddhist faith with many generous contributions to temples, </p><p>monasteries, and pagodas." </p><p> </p><p>(NOTE: probably ninety percent of Than Shwe\'s public </p><p>appearances consist of inspecting roads and bridges or making </p><p>donations to Buddhist groups, leaving little doubt about the </p><p>real-life hero of the evening\'s musical drama.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Anti-Fascist Resistance Day </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) About 400 supporters of pro-democracy parties crammed </p><p>together in the run-down headquarters of the NLD, with scores </p><p>of people outside listening to the presentations on </p><p>loudspeakers.  There was no visible security force presence </p><p>and the participants were not hindered in any way.  Diplomats </p><p>representing the U.S., Britain, Australia, Japan, France, </p><p>Italy, and Korea attended, as did reps from UNDP, UNICEF, and </p><p>UNODC. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Speaking forcefully in Burmese, Aung San Suu Kyi </p><p>recalled her father\'s aims in leading Burma\'s drive toward </p><p>independence.  She also echoed JFK\'s "ask not" speech when </p><p>she said: </p><p> </p><p>There are some people who ask, "when will we achieve </p><p>democracy?"  Instead of asking such a question, ask yourself </p><p>whether you are doing your duty and contributing towards it. </p><p>We need to overcome such difficulties as we did during the </p><p>revolutionary period against fascists.  We will surely </p><p>succeed! </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) After her short extemporaneous speech, ASSK sat on </p><p>the floor on a woven mat alongside NLD party representatives </p><p>from around the country and listened in the stifling heat to </p><p>the other speakers.  Monks, student groups, and at least 6 </p><p>other political parties were represented at the event. </p><p>Former Defense Minister U Tin Oo, the NLD\'s Vice Chairman, </p><p>gave the lengthy keynote address, calling for national unity </p><p>and a strong military with a dignified position within a </p><p>democratic Union.  Afterwards ASSK came over and warmly </p><p>thanked the Charge\' for attending. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  The NLD\'s geriatric Central Executive Committee, </p><p>seated in a row of chairs behind the podium, resembled the </p><p>front porch, one might imagine, of Rangoon\'s Home for the </p><p>Aged and Infirm. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The events of the day, punctuated by the lethal </p><p>mid-day bomb blast, illuminated many differences between the </p><p>ruling State Peace and Development Committee and the </p><p>pro-democracy parties in style, aims, power, and wealth.  The </p><p>democratic parties, absent progress on substantive dialogue </p><p>leading to political transition, run the risk of becoming </p><p>irrelevant in the eyes of those who impatiently chafe at the </p><p>regime\'s repressive rule.  The terrorist bombs of March 27 </p><p>reinforce the view of some people of the need for continued </p><p>strong military rule, while for others they highlight ongoing </p><p>resistance to such rule.  The challenge ahead for Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi and the NLD is to effect visible signs of peaceful </p><p>progress in the face of determined intransigence on the part </p><p>of the ruling SPDC and the violent provocations from a small </p><p>number of anti-regime radicals.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
