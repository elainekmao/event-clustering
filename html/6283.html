<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000519 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR REFUGEE OFFICERS; CAIRO FOR POL -- MAXSTADT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, PGOV, IV, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UNHCR SEEKS USG HELP WITH NIGERIA ON </p><p>LIBERIAN REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 36393 </p><p>     B. LAGOS 00381 </p><p>     C. LAGOS 00407 </p><p>     D. ACCRA 00363 </p><p>     E. SECSTATE 08699 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CG ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B&D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Eusebe Hounsokou, UNHCR representative in </p><p>Nigeria, updated Poloff on his efforts to relocate 5,000 </p><p>Liberian refugees from Cote d\'Ivoire to Nigeria (Ref B).  Per </p><p>UNHCR Geneva\'s information, Hounsokou advised the GON that, </p><p>since the USG may take up to 10,000 Liberian refugees for </p><p>resettlement, permanent shelters will not/not be necessary to </p><p>accommodate those transferred here until arrangements can be </p><p>made to move them to the United States.  If the GON approves </p><p>the relocation, UNHCR will advise against placing all 5,000 </p><p>Liberian refugees in a single camp within Nigeria.  He asked </p><p>that Ambassador Jeter raise the issue with President </p><p>Obasanjo.  Per Abuja Septel, GON appears to be leaning toward </p><p>accepting some refugees.  Ambassador\'s intervention with the </p><p>President may not be necessary.  Apparently receiving </p><p>inaccurate information from Geneva, Hounsokou is representing </p><p>our offer regarding possible United States resettlement of </p><p>refugees as more ironclad than we would like. </p><p>Washington/Geneva may want to clarify this with UNHCR (see </p><p>para 5).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On February 26, Hounsokou recounted to Poloff his </p><p>earlier conversations with MFA Permanent Secretary Ambassador </p><p>Daniel Hart and GON Commissioner for Refugees Professor Igna </p><p>Gabriel.  Hounsokou\'s initial approach to the MFA was not </p><p>forwarded to Nigeria\'s refugee commissioner, who asked that a </p><p>formal request be readdressed to him. Hounsokou sent the </p><p>requested letter to Commissioner Gabriel on February 25 and </p><p>was awaiting the GON\'s official reply.  On separate </p><p>occasions, each gentleman gave Hounsokou his personal support </p><p>for relocating the requested 5,000 Liberian refugees to </p><p>Nigeria from Cote d\'Ivoire (Ref A).  Each told Hounsokou he </p><p>felt "ashamed" that Nigeria had not taken part in the </p><p>military operation, and thus hoped the GON would play a </p><p>humanitarian role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Hounsokou is optimistic that GON will accept the </p><p>refugees for relocation here.  Gabriel suggested to Hounsokou </p><p>that Obasanjo will make the decision personally.  Gabriel </p><p>will tell Obasanjo his opinion that "This is our duty.  We </p><p>should assist with the refugees."  Hounsokou asked if </p><p>Ambassador Jeter could speak with President Obasanjo to </p><p>confirm USG interest in the issue and to encourage a rapid </p><p>decision on the GON\'s part. (Embassy Abuja delivered the </p><p>Reftel A demarche to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The </p><p>Nigerians seemed to be leaning heavily toward a positive </p><p>decision. Consequently, there is little utility for the </p><p>Ambassador\'s intervention at this stage. The MFA and other </p><p>GON agencies are scheduled to meet within the next week and </p><p>make a decision on the refugees.  Depending on the decision, </p><p>the Mission will reconsider the appropriateness of Ambassador </p><p>Jeter intervening with the President.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NOTE: UNHCR Geneva apparently advised Hounsokou that </p><p>USG may take up to 10,000 Liberian refugees for resettlement. </p><p> On this basis, he is suggesting to the GON that permanent </p><p>shelters will not/not be necessary to accommodate those </p><p>transferred here until arrangements can be made to move them </p><p>to the U.S.  Poloff cautioned Hounsokou that the USG would </p><p>first require each individual case to be dutifully </p><p>documented, something we understand has been difficult given </p><p>the problems with file corruption at Nicla (Refs A and D). </p><p>Hounsokou requested more information about what USG </p><p>requirements will entail in this regard. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Washington/Geneva: Based on information received from </p><p>UNHCR Geneva, Hounsokou apparently has represented to the GON </p><p>that the USG was firmly committed to taking thousands of </p><p>refugees.  Our interpretation of Reftel A indicates that this </p><p>is not the case.  To avoid future misunderstanding, </p><p>Washington/Geneva may want to clarify our position with UNHCR </p><p>Geneva. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Hounsokou expressed concern that the GON may lack the </p><p>resources to transport the refugees.  Any assistance the USG </p><p>can provide in this regard would be appreciated. Poloff </p><p>suggested that Hounsokou check with UNHCR Geneva for possible </p><p>transportation funds, and mentioned that the USG recently </p><p>contributed $30 million to the UNHCR that was allocated to </p><p>Africa (Ref E). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) If the GON approves the relocation, UNHCR will advise </p><p>against placing all 5,000 Liberian refugees in a single camp </p><p>within Nigeria.  Experience has taught UNHCR that large </p><p>refugee camps often become recruitment grounds for armed </p><p>factions to recruit fighters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) UNHCR plans to relocate its main office to Abuja </p><p>sometime between September and December 2003, when their </p><p>contractor should have completed the new facility.  Due to </p><p>the Lagos office\'s proximity to the refugee camp, Hounsokou </p><p>would like to keep a senior staff member here to manage the </p><p>camp. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT: The GON has provided hopeful signs that it </p><p>will accept a number of refugees. Whatever it decides, the </p><p>GON will base its decision on its role as  a sub-regional </p><p>leader balanced against strong domestic budgetary and </p><p>political exigencies.  Potential USG plans to resettle </p><p>Liberians in the U.S. may be a factor in the decision but a </p><p>secondary one.  However, unless corrected, the </p><p>misunderstanding that the US will take in most of not all </p><p>these refugees will be important in shaping UNHCR and </p><p>Nigeria\'s plans for accommodating the refugees.  The UNHCR </p><p>and the GON would need significantly fewer resources to </p><p>accommodate refugees on a short-term basis.  Consequently, it </p><p>is imperative that we eliminate any misunderstanding about </p><p>the USG\'s commitment toward the Liberian refugees.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
