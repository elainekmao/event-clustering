TUDJMAN SAID HE TOO HAD TOURED THE COASTAL AREA </p><p>AND HAD SEEN FIRSTHAND THE SCALE OF DESTRUCTION.  HE </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE DEVASTATION WAS FAR GREATER </p><p>SOUTH OF DUBROVNIK, IN THE DIRECTION OF MONTENEGRO. </p><p>HE HAD LIVED THROUGH A WORLD WAR, BUT THE BARBARITY </p><p>OF ACTION IN THIS CONFLICT WAS UNPRECEDENTED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02522  02 OF 04  301209Z </p><p>SARAJEVO IMPRESSIONS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  SENATOR MOYNIHAN TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT HE HAD </p><p>OVERNIGHTED IN SARAJEVO NOV 24, TOURED THE CITY, MET </p><p>WITH PRESIDENT IZETBEGOVIC, AND BEEN BRIEFED BY UNHCR </p><p>ON THE PRECARIOUS FOOD SUPPLY SITUATION.  HE HAD BEEN </p><p>TOLD BY UNHCR THAT SARAJEVO WAS DOWN TO ONLY ONE </p><p>DAY\'S FOOD SUPPLY; INCOMING FOOD ON CONVOYS AND </p><p>RELIEF FLIGHTS IS DISTRIBUTED AND CONSUMED.  TUDJMAN </p><p>SAID IZETBEGOVIC HAD PROBABLY INFORMED THE SENATOR </p><p>THAT SOME 128,000 BOSNIANS HAD BEEN KILLED AND 30,000 </p><p>GIRLS AND WOMEN RAPED BY SERBIAN FORCES IN B-H.  THESE </p><p>FIGURES MIGHT, OF COURSE, BE EXAGGERATED, BUT EVEN IF </p><p>THE REAL FIGURES WERE ONLY HALF, THE NUMBERS WERE </p><p>STILL OUTRAGEOUS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>ON THE WAR CRIMES COMMISSION </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

TUDJMAN </p><p>SAID BLUNTLY THAT SANCTIONS ALONE WILL NOT STOP </p><p>SERBIAN AGGRESSION.  SERBIAN POLITICS HAS BECOME </p><p>IRRATIONAL.  SERBIAN EXTREMISTS FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A </p><p>BETTER CHANCE TO CREATE A "GREATER SERBIA" BY WAR </p><p>THAN BY OTHER MEANS.

THERE ARE CREDIBLE </p><p>REPORTS THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED RUSSIAN "VOLUNTEERS" ARE </p><p>NOW FIGHTING ON THE SERBIAN SIDE IN B-H. </p><p> </p><p>8.  TUDJMAN CALLED FOR THE WEST TO EMPLOY SELECTIVE </p><p>AIR STRIKES.  WESTERN GROUND FORCES ARE NOT NEEDED. </p><p>THE AIR POWER SHOULD BE DIRECTED AGAINST SERBIAN AIR </p><p>BASES, MILITARY FACTORIES, ARTILLERY EMPLACEMENTS, </p><p>AND OTHER MILITARY SITES.  THE SERBS ARE NOW OPENLY </p><p>BOASTING ABOUT THEIR MILITARY MIGHT AND THEIR INTENT </p><p>TO BEGIN BUILDING "GUIDED MISSILES."

GENERAL MORILLON, THE UNPROFOR COMMANDER IN </p><p>SARAJEVO, HAD TOLD SENATOR MOYNIHAN THAT HE WAS </p><p>STRONGLY OPPOSED TO LIFTING OF THE ARMS EMBARGO. </p><p>ASKED FOR HIS VIEW, TUDJMAN SAID THAT LIFTING THE </p><p>ARMS EMBARGO WOULD MERELY ENSURE THAT THE DEATH AND </p><p>DEVASTATION SPREAD AND CONTINUED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER </p><p>YEAR OR TWO.  THE SERBS ALREADY HAVE SUCH AN </p><p>ADVANTAGE IN COMBAT AIRCRAFT, TANKS, AND ARTILLERY </p><p>THAT THEIR MILITARY SUPERIORITY WOULD NOT BE </p><p>CHALLENGED ANYTIME SOON, EVEN IF ARMS STARTED TO FLOW </p><p>TO THEIR OPPONENTS IMMEDIATELY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  TUDJMAN SAID THE SOLUTION TO THE B-H CRISIS IS </p><p>TO STOP SERBIAN AGGRESSION AND AIR STRIKES OUGHT TO </p><p>BE USED TO THAT END.  HE SPECULATED THAT B-H MIGHT </p><p>HAVE TO BECOME A UN "PROTECTORATE" TO BE SAVED.  HE </p><p>SAID IT HAD BEEN A MISTAKE FOR THE EC COUNTRIES AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE SO REPETITIVELY </p><p>CLEAR AT THE OUTSET OF THE CRISIS THAT THEY WOULD NOT </p><p>INTERVENE MILITARILY.  THE SERBS HAD SEEN IN THIS </p><p>STANCE A VIRTUAL GREEN LIGHT FOR MILITARY ACTION </p><p>WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02522  03 OF 04  300917Z </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>SERBIAN GOAL WAS TO RE-ESTABLISH COMMUNIST SYSTEM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02522  04 OF 04  300918Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   CA-02    CIAE-00  PFIP-01  C-01     DODE-00 </p><p>      CISA-02  DS-00    HA-09    H-01     INRE-00  INR-01   IO-19 </p><p>      L-03     ADS-00   MFLO-03  M-01     NSAE-00  OCS-06   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-01    PC-01    PM-02    PRS-01   P-01     RP-10 </p><p>      SCT-03   SDEL-00  SNP-00   SP-00    SR-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-01     ASDS-01  FMP-00     /075W </p><p>                  ------------------7FE9BC  300918Z /38 </p><p>P 300918Z NOV 92 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 2854 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02522  04 OF 04  300918Z </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA </p><p>USIA WASHDC 2494 </p><p> COMSIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GM//ECJ3/ECJ5// </p><p>USEC BRUSSELS </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC 1109 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 04 ZAGREB 02522 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USDEL ICFY -- JACKOVICH; USVIENNA FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, PREF, HR, BK </p><p>SUBJECT:  CGYOOL:  PRES TUDJMAN TELLS SENATOR MOYNIHAN </p><p>-         IT\'S TIME FOR AIR STRIKES AGAINST THE </p><p>-         SERBS; CAUTIONS AGAINST LIFTING ARMS EMBARGO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  JNA/SERBIAN MILITARY AGGRESSION AGAINST CROATIA </p><p>LAST YEAR HAD AS ONE OF ITS GOALS THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF THE FORMER COMMUNIST SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE FORMER </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA.  A SECONDARY GOAL WAS SERBIAN CONQUEST OF </p><p>PARTS OF CROATIAN TERRITORY.  SERBIAN MILITARY </p><p>STRATEGISTS HAD COUNTED ON SUPPORT FROM SOVIET </p><p>MILITARY OFFICERS, INCLUDING MANY OF THOSE WHO </p><p>PLOTTED AGAINST GORBACHEV. </p><p> </p><p>12.  AT THE START OF THE YUGO-CRISIS, CROATIA\'S GOAL </p><p>WAS CONFEDERATION.

TUDJMAN COMMENTED THAT SOME 700-800,000 </p><p>DISPLACED PERSONS FROM CROATIA AND REFUGEES FROM B-H </p><p>ARE PRESENTLY IN CROATIA.  THEIR CARE AND FEEDING IS </p><p>A MAJOR EXPENSE (NOTE:  20 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>BUDGET NOW GOES FOR DIRECT CARE AND FEEDING OF THE </p><p>REFUGEES AND DISPLACED.)  THIS BURDEN COMPOUNDED THE </p><p>IMPORTANT LOSS OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAV MARKET AND THE </p><p>WIDESPREAD ECONOMIC DEVASTATION CROATIA HAD SUFFERED </p><p>IN THE WAR.  "IT\'S A MIRACLE THAT WE HAVE SURVIVED </p><p>ALL OF THIS," TUDJMAN SAID.  HE SAID THAT SUPPORT </p><p>FROM THE CROATIAN DIASPORA HAD BEEN CRITICAL IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S SURVIVAL. </p><p> </p><p>14.
