<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001334 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2006 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, KISL, PGOV, PREL, SOCI, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: REACHING OUT AT THE SHI\'ITE FEAST OF AL-ARBA\'EEN </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic, reason: 1.5 (A) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action cable.  Please see paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Both the people and the Government of Kuwait support </p><p>U.S. actions in Iraq very strongly.   Even here, however, the </p><p>constant drumbeat in the Arabic press of U.S. anti-Muslim </p><p>intent is having an effect.  In recent conversations worried </p><p>Kuwaitis have engaged the Ambassador on ways that this </p><p>negative image might be dispelled. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Kuwaitis argue that it will be important for the </p><p>United States, as it consolidates control of the southern </p><p>part of Iraq, particularly to show deference and reverence </p><p>for the Shi\'ite shrines which are located in Najaf and </p><p>Karbala. Our interlocutors suggest and Embassy agrees that </p><p>the Shi\'ite high holiday of al-Arba\'een on or about April 22 </p><p>presents a real opportunity for the United States to show its </p><p>respect for Muslims while also providing a boost to the local </p><p>economy.   Every year on the Feast of al-Arba\'een these </p><p>shrines routinely distribute food to the poor to help them </p><p>celebrate.  It is both a religious gesture and a form of aid </p><p>to the poor.  It is greatly appreciated by the recipients and </p><p>it is also viewed as a religious obligation.  While rich in </p><p>symbolism, this food is not expensive, it consists primarily </p><p>of cooked lamb and rice with various spices, delivered to </p><p>poor families on large trays. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Embassy recommends that this year the United States, </p><p>via the U.S. military and/or ORHA, contribute lamb and rice </p><p>for the poor on the al-Arba\'een holiday.  Working with </p><p>contacts inside the country, the United States could purchase </p><p>large numbers of sheep, contract with Halal butchers to </p><p>slaughter them, provide rice and other spices to local cooks </p><p>and have the food delivered on trays to the mosques for </p><p>distribution.  This would be a relatively simple procedure, </p><p>but we believe it would have a high impact value inside Iraq </p><p>at the grass roots level where we want to make the greatest </p><p>impression.  It would also have a high international </p><p>recognition factor, particularly in the Muslim world.  From </p><p>contacts here we believe that probably each tray of food </p><p>would cost no more than $20 on the local economy.  Although </p><p>we would want to consult with religious leaders to be sure, </p><p>we suppose 2000 trays would be about the maximum we could </p><p>provide to the two mosques for distribution.  The program </p><p>could be repeated on a smaller scale in other towns with a </p><p>US-presence in cooperation with local religious leaders.  All </p><p>told, an outlay of perhaps as little as USD 50,000 would have </p><p>tremendous political impact while injecting significant </p><p>liquidity into rural communities. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Action Request:  Such a program would be worth its </p><p>weight in gold.  We commend this idea to Washington for </p><p>consideration and action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
