<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000046 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP (LMALENAS), NEA/PPD (JDAVIES), NEA/P </p><p>(ACASPER), INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  IRAQ, MEPI, AND DEMOCRACY IN THE GULF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  UAE MEDIA FOCUSED ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S RECENT SPEECH </p><p>AT FORT HOOD MILITARY BASE IN TEXAS.  "AL KHALEEJ" NOTED THE </p><p>FACTS ON THE GROUND PROVE PRESIDENT BUSH\'S ALLEGATIONS ON IRAQ </p><p>HAVING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION ARE NOT TRUE.  WRITERS AND OP- </p><p>EDS ALSO COMMENTED ON MEPI IN THE ARABIC DAILIES.  DR. SHAMLAN AL </p><p>EISA WARNED IN AN "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL THAT GULF STATES MUST </p><p>NOT DELAY COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS.  EGYPTIAN WRITER JALAL AREF </p><p>DESCRIBES MEPI IN "AL BAYAN" AS A COMEDY, AND A PROOF THAT </p><p>AMERICANS - DESPITE THEIR ARROGANCE - ENJOY SOME SENSE OF HUMOUR. </p><p>MEANWHILE, IN "AL BAYAN," COLUMNIST AHMED AMRABI BELIEVES THE </p><p>U.S. WILL LOSE ITS WAR AGAINST ISLAM AND MUSLIMS.  CALLING FOR A </p><p>CHANGE OF THE "MOUNTAINS OF HATRED INTO TOWERS OF LOVE," DR. </p><p>MURAD RAGHEB HANNA URGED THE U.S. TO SPEND THE $200 BILLION </p><p>ALLOCATED FOR A WAR ON IRAQ ON THE POOR WHO NEED IT MOST. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ARGUING AGAINST PRESIDENT BUSH\'S DESCRIPTION OF IRAQ AS A </p><p>THREAT TO THE U.S., SHARJAH-BASED BAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 1/5: </p><p> </p><p>"... FACTS PROVE THE U.S. PRESIDENT\'S ALLEGATIONS ARE NOT TRUE. </p><p>WHAT HAPPENS ON THE GROUND TOTALLY CONTRADICTS HIS SPEECH.  THE </p><p>U.S. AFTER 9/11 BECAME A THREAT TO IRAQ, THE REGION, AND EVEN THE </p><p>WHOLE WORLD.  THE NATIONAL STRATEGY ANNOUNCED RECENTLY IS A CLEAR </p><p>STRATEGY OF WAR AGAINST ANYONE WHO STANDS IN ITS (THE U.S.) WAY </p><p>OR ENDANGERS ITS INTERESTS." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE REACTION OF GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL STATES </p><p>TO A NEGATIVE U.S. MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND MEPI, DR. SHAMLAN AL EISA </p><p>WROTE IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-OFFICIAL "AL ITTIHAD" ON 1/5: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE GULF STATES NEITHER ABSORB THE NEXT AMERICAN STEPS NOR </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE TRANSFORMATION TOWARDS DEMOCRACY... WE, IN THE </p><p>GULF, PAY A HIGH PRICE FOR THE WRONG POLICIES OF OUR GOVERNMENTS </p><p>AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM OF SECURITY AND </p><p>DEFENSE.  BUT WHEN THERE IS A REAL THREAT, OUR COUNTRIES ARE </p><p>UNABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND RELY ON OTHERS TO DO THAT ... IT </p><p>IS OBVIOUS IRAQ WILL BE QUALIFIED TO BECOME THE MINARET OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN THE WHOLE ARAB WORLD AND THE BASE OF THE POLICY OF </p><p>CHANGE.  QATAR, BAHRAIN, AND OMAN WILL BE THE FOCUS OF THE U.S. </p><p>AFTER BAGHDAD...  THE GULF STATES ARE NOW STANDING AT A </p><p>CROSSROADS, WHETHER TO TAKE THE AMERICAN TRAIN AND CONTROL THE </p><p>EXPECTED DAMAGES, OR STEP ASIDE AND BEAR THE IMPACT OF A HIT BY </p><p>THE COMING CHANGE." </p><p> </p><p>4.  DESCRIBING MEPI AS A HUMOUROUS PLAY ON WORDS, DEPUTY CHIEF </p><p>EDITOR OF EGYPTIAN "AKHABR AL YOUM" WROTE IN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS- </p><p>ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" ON 1/5: </p><p> </p><p>"THE $29-MILLION \'COMEDY\' OF AN INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED BY SECRETARY </p><p>OF STATE COLIN POWELL TO TEACH ARABS THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS (I DON\'T KNOW WHY IT IS NOT $30 </p><p>MILLION) WINS OVER THE COMEDIES WE WATCH DURING RAMADAN.  IT ALSO </p><p>PROVES AMERICANS - DESPITE THEIR ARROGANCE - ENJOY SOME SENSE OF </p><p>HUMOUR ... WHEN WASHINGTON TALKS ABOUT PARTNERSHIP (ESPECIALLY </p><p>THESE DAYS), THE MATTER IS A POLITICAL COMEDY.  WASHINGTON </p><p>REFUSES TO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP EVEN WITH ITS CLOSES ALLY IN </p><p>DECISION-MAKING.  THUS, IT WILL NOT VOLUNTEER TO MAKE ARABS ITS </p><p>PARTNERS... THE U.S. PRESIDENT FACILITATES THE MOST HORRIBLE </p><p>MASSACRES AND GIVES ALL U.S. SUPPORT TO SHARON AND HIS GANG TO </p><p>PRACTICE HIS TERROR ON PALESTINIANS AND ARABS, WHO THEN SHOULD BE </p><p>THE FIRST STEP TO JOIN POWELL\'S SCHOOL OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ... WHERE IS THE AMERICAN TALK ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS FROM WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE ISRAEL?  WHY DOESN\'T WASHINGTON </p><p>ACT QUICKLY AS IT DID IN THE CASE OF SA\'ADUL DIN IBRAHIM, WHEN </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION PERSONALLY PUT ALL ITS </p><p>PRESSURE ON EGYPT, FREEZING ECONOMIC AID, AND INITIATING A MEDIA </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SENTENCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  CLAIMING THE U.S. WILL LOSE ITS \'BATTLE\' AGAINST ISLAM, AHMED </p><p>AMRABI WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" ON 1/5: </p><p> </p><p>"... WITH THE ABSENCE OF AN ALTERNATIVE THOUGHT SUITABLE FOR ARAB </p><p>AND MUSLIM YOUTH, THE AMERICAN WAR AGAINST ISLAM UNDER THE SLOGAN </p><p>\'WAR ON TERRORISM\' WILL ONLY ATTRACT MORE YOUNG PEOPLE TO ISLAM. </p><p>ISLAM IS NOT A STUPID FAITH AND THE QURAN IS NOT MERE PREACHING </p><p>... A MUSLIM WORKS FOR THIS LIFE AND THE LIFE AFTER... </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, HOW CAN THE U.S. HOPE TO SUMMARIZE ITS WAR AGAINST </p><p>ISLAM AND MUSLIMS INTO ONLY ONE WORD, \'TERRORISM\'." </p><p> </p><p>6.  ARGUING THE U.S. IMPOSES ITS PRINCIPLES ON ARABS, ALGERIAN </p><p>WRITER DR. KHAIRUL DEEN AL AYEB SAID IN "AL BAYAN" ON 1/6: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE TRUTH IS THAT THE U.S. WANTS TO ISOLATE ANY COUNTRIES </p><p>DEFYING ITS PRINCIPLES BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, IT (THE U.S.) WANTS TO IMPOSE THESE PRINCIPLES ON </p><p>ARAB SOCIETIES, ESPECIALLY CONSERVATIVE ONES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>... ANY SANE PERSON COMPREHENDS THE BUILD UP OF ARMIES IS NOT TO </p><p>STRIKE IRAQ ... THE EQUATION IS SIMPLY EITHER COUNTRIES ADAPT TO </p><p>THE NEW WORLD ORDER, OR THEY WILL BE BESIEGED AND PARALYZED UNTIL </p><p>THEY YIELD BY FORCE TO U.S. ORDERS ... ALL ARABS MUST MAKE A </p><p>QUICK DECISION, AS OUR DESTINY AND EXISTENCE BECOME A SUBJECT TO </p><p>BARGAINING.  THE FEAR IS THAT WE END UP AT THE MARGIN OF THE </p><p>ARRANGED NEW WORLD ORDER.  THE REAL FEAR IS THAT, ONE DAY, WE </p><p>PERISH IN THE SAME WAY AS PREVIOUS CIVILIZATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "HOW CAN THE U.S. BE AN EMPIRE OF GOOD?" </p><p>DR. MURAD RAGHEB HANNA WROTE IN "AL ITTIHAD" ON 1/6: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. ALLOCATES MONEY TO FINANCE A WAR, WHICH MAY COST </p><p>$200 BILLION ... THE U.S. CAN UTILIZE THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY - </p><p>IF IT DESIRES - TO CIVILIZE THE ENTIRE WORLD AND CHANGE MOUNTAINS </p><p>OF HATRED INTO TOWERS OF LOVE, ESPECIALLY IF IT FEEDS MILLIONS OF </p><p>HUNGRY CHILDREN IN THE WORLD.  THIS AMOUNT IS ENOUGH TO SOLVE ALL </p><p>THE PROBLEMS OF POOR AFRICAN COUNTRIES, WHICH SUFFER FROM THE </p><p>TERRORISM OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN LUXURY ON THIS EARTH.  THE U.S. </p><p>CAN WIN THE LOVE, APPRECIATION, AND RESPECT OF THE ENTIRE WORLD, </p><p>IF IT CARES FOR THE LIFE OF THOSE CHILDREN, INSTEAD OF KILLING </p><p>THE CHILDREN OF IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
