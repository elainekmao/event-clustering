<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 001091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:DECL: 1.6x6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MASS, MARR, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA -- OBASANJO WARM TO MILITARY </p><p>ASSISTANCE BUT OVERHEATED ABOUT DEBT RELIEF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON </p><p>1.6x6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During a late night April 3 meeting </p><p>with Ambassador Jeter, President Obasanjo gave a Janus- </p><p>faced performance. Affable and engaging at the onset, </p><p>he commended POTUS for quickly approving UXO assistance </p><p>to help with the Ikeja cantonment explosion. Obasanjo, </p><p>asserting the military assistance relationship was </p><p>vital, promised to allocate 3.5 million USD to continue </p><p>the MPRI program for another year. Conversely, he waxed </p><p>hot and frustrated over debt relief, even hurtling a </p><p>few expletives at the IMF.  In between the two </p><p>extremes, Obasanjo explained he had tried to insulate </p><p>himself from USG pressure on Zimbabwe because he did </p><p>not want his decision perceived as capitulation to </p><p>Western arm-twisting. Despite recently appointing a </p><p>special mediator on Zimbabwe, Obasanjo was unexpectedly </p><p>dismissive of further personal engagement, stating that </p><p>"Zimbabwe was behind us." Joining President Obasanjo in </p><p>the meeting was Minister of State for Army Batagarawa. </p><p>PolCouns accompanied Ambassador Jeter. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>THE MILITARY RELATIONSHIP -- KEEPING THE BALL ROLLING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador Jeter began by expressing concern </p><p>about slippage in certain aspects of the military </p><p>assistance relationship due to Nigerian </p><p>unresponsiveness to our questions on some outstanding </p><p>issues.  An animated Obasanjo interrupted the </p><p>Ambassador in mid-sentence, asserting that he was </p><p>getting along fine with President Bush "on most </p><p>fronts," but particularly on the military relationship. </p><p>Obasanjo stressed that being "a simple minded" man, he </p><p>would never forget the favor POTUS extended by quickly </p><p>approving Nigeria\'s emergency plea for UXO assistance. </p><p>Obasanjo declared he would "sacrifice" to keep the mil- </p><p>mil relationship on even keel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MPRI: Ambassador interjected that MPRI was an </p><p>important aspect of the relationship yet the GON was </p><p>still noncommittal on whether it wanted to continue the </p><p>program. Ambassador emphasized that MPRI was viewed in </p><p>Foggy Bottom, the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill as a key </p><p>barometer of Nigeria\'s commitment to military reform. </p><p>If MPRI were allowed to wither, Washington would </p><p>perceive the commitment to reform as weak. This would </p><p>have negative consequences for future military </p><p>assistance levels. Frowning and shaking his head from </p><p>side to side, Obasanjo posited that many in the </p><p>military just did not like MPRI. Initially, he </p><p>attributed their opposition to the "Malu Syndrome," </p><p>referring to the former Chief of Army Staff who </p><p>vociferously opposed key elements of our military </p><p>assistance package, especially Operation Focus Relief. </p><p>However, Obasanjo admitted that opposition within the </p><p>services was more widespread than he previously had </p><p>gauged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Despite some continued opposition within the </p><p>uniformed military, Minister of State Batagarawa </p><p>thought MPRI was beneficial to streamlining the </p><p>military and constituted an important tool in </p><p>solidifying civilian control over the uniformed forces. </p><p>While strongly endorsing MPRI\'s continuation, he </p><p>attributed some of the opposition to personality </p><p>clashes between MPRI staff and senior Nigerian officers </p><p>when the program first began. He contended that some </p><p>MPRI personnel were cultural insensitive, </p><p>condescendingly rubbing GON general officers the wrong </p><p>way by not paying appropriate attention to the Nigerian </p><p>officers\' seniority in rank and, in effect, appearing </p><p>to order these more senior Nigerian officers around. </p><p>Batagarawa contended that much of the original </p><p>frostiness had thawed and MPRI was steadily gaining </p><p>converts as more officers began to understand the </p><p>program. Obasanjo remarked if MPRI was the bellwether </p><p>of the assistance program, he would order MPRI to </p><p>continue. Batagarawa gently chimed that several months </p><p>ago he had written the President requesting approval to </p><p>extend MPRI but his letter remained unanswered. Looking </p><p>more perplexed than angry, the President dismissed the </p><p>Minister\'s comments with a wave of his hand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) After several quick round-robin exchanges among </p><p>Obasanjo, Batagarawa and the Ambassador regarding the </p><p>level of funding needed to continue MPRI at its present </p><p>level, Obasanjo stated that he would wrest 3.5 million </p><p>USD from the treasury to extend the program. Ambassador </p><p>Jeter mentioned Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ogohi </p><p>had indicated in a recent letter his intention to use </p><p>the 1.5 million USD in Nigeria\'s FMF account as its 50 </p><p>percent contribution to finance a scaled-down MPRI. </p><p>Obasanjo iterated his promise to fund Nigeria\'s half of </p><p>the extension of the full scale MPRI program from the </p><p>regular budget, adding that he wanted to save the FMF </p><p>to help repair C-130s. However, the 3.5 million had not </p><p>been budgeted and Obasanjo wondered aloud from which </p><p>budgetary pocket would he take it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) C-130s: Batagarawa echoed that the FMF monies </p><p>should be reserved for C-130 repair. Noting our receipt </p><p>of Batagarawa\'s letter concerning the C-130s, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter said we were preparing a reply but </p><p>that the letter\'s apparent insistence on "sole- </p><p>sourcing" the work to Lockheed- Martin may be </p><p>problematic due to our strong regulatory preference for </p><p>open bidding. Batagarawa replied that was not the </p><p>intention of the letter. He did not care who did the </p><p>work.  His only concern was to the planes air-worthy. </p><p>Obasanjo endorsed his subordinate\'s response, adding </p><p>that having operable planes would be a concrete visible </p><p>benefit of the military relationship that would impress </p><p>the public and silence some critics. Also, it would </p><p>enable Nigeria to provide lift for its own peacekeeping </p><p>troops, an important step toward the goal of self- </p><p>sufficiency in PKO deployments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Obasanjo then provided a glimpse of his strategy </p><p>for Nigerian peacekeeping readiness. Thanking POTUS </p><p>this time for the five OFR-trained battalions, Obasanjo </p><p>said that he had asked POTUS for assistance in training </p><p>and equipping five additional battalions.  Obasanjo </p><p>stated that his plan was to have a minimum of ten well- </p><p>trained, fully equipped battalions that he would </p><p>dedicate for peacekeeping operations, particularly </p><p>within ECOWAS but with the capacity (furnished by </p><p>operable C-130s) of deploying anywhere on the </p><p>continent. Obasanjo asserted that he would keep these </p><p>battalions intact and would work with us to provide </p><p>follow-on training to prevent these special battalions </p><p>from losing their edge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ambassador Jeter mentioned that Washington was </p><p>contemplating the successor to ACRI and would be </p><p>soliciting Abuja\'s views with the hope that Nigeria </p><p>would participate this time around.  Batagarawa added </p><p>that, in his December visit to Washington, DOD </p><p>officials informed him that the post-ACRI program might </p><p>be modeled closely after OFR.   If so, he believed </p><p>Nigeria participation was almost assured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) EOD: After the Ikeja explosions, it was </p><p>initially agreed that we would provide experts to </p><p>assess other munitions depots to alert the GON to </p><p>possible dangers and avoid a repeat tragedy.  Thus, </p><p>Ambassador expressed surprise that Defense Minister </p><p>Danjuma had forbidden USG experts now in Nigeria from </p><p>conducting the safety assessments.  Obasanjo scoffed at </p><p>Danjuma\'s reticence, stating that Danjuma and his </p><p>Service Chiefs were afraid that the CIA was trying to </p><p>spy on them.  He laughed, "There was nothing that the </p><p>CIA wanted to know about Nigeria\'s armories that it did </p><p>not already know." Pointing to Batagarawa, Obasanjo </p><p>asked, although already knowing the answer, whether </p><p>Nigeria had people with the requisite expertise and </p><p>thus could afford the luxury of refusing the USG </p><p>assistance.  After Batagarawa\'s negative reply, </p><p>Obasanjo instructed the Minister of State to make sure </p><p>the assessments went forward and requested Ambassador </p><p>Jeter to extend the stay of the experts beyond their </p><p>planned April 5 departure. (Note: The experts have </p><p>extended their TDY in Nigeria.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Turning to Ambassador Jeter, Obasanjo groused </p><p>that Ambassador Jeter had not been coming to the Villa </p><p>for discussions as often as he should.  Jeter responded </p><p>that he had been rejected on several occasions when he </p><p>sought meetings recently. Obasanjo chuckled, then </p><p>admitted the Ambassador\'s inability to land an </p><p>appointment was his own doing.  The reason was </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Obasanjo claimed he had sequestered himself </p><p>from us; he wanted to make his own decision regarding </p><p>Zimbabwe independent of Western pressure.  Obasanjo </p><p>contended that he wanted to be able to tell the world </p><p>that whatever was his decision was his alone and not </p><p>the result of Western arm-twisting. (Obasanjo also </p><p>indicated that he had not discussed his decision with </p><p>other like-minded leaders, including South Africa\'s </p><p>Mbeki.) Because he kept his distance from the USG, </p><p>Obasanjo said he was able to talk frankly to President </p><p>Mugabe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) However, implying that his conversation with </p><p>Mugabe had been more sympathetic that stern, Obasanjo </p><p>said that he told Mugabe that the decision of the </p><p>London meeting would be the best possible outcome </p><p>Mugabe could reasonably expect.  Obasanjo continued </p><p>that he did not even confer with President Mbeki prior </p><p>to the London meeting.  Obasanjo stressed that the </p><p>one-year suspension was inevitable given the </p><p>Commonwealth Observer Mission\'s conclusions about the </p><p>dismal quality of the Zimbabwean elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) At the Commonwealth meeting in Australia, the </p><p>Heads of State agreed to adhere to the Observer Teams </p><p>report.  Even though some observers rendered far less </p><p>critical reports, we still stuck to the Commonwealth </p><p>report at the London meeting, Obasanjo stated with </p><p>resignation.  Now that the decision had been made, </p><p>Obasanjo opined, "Zimbabwe was now behind us."  When </p><p>Ambassador Jeter tried to mention the need for </p><p>sustaining diplomatic pressure on Mugabe, Obasanjo </p><p>interjected that Zimbabwe may not be "behind you, but </p><p>was still behind us." (Comment: Clearly, Obasanjo was </p><p>not enamored with having to suspend Zimbabwe from the </p><p>Commonwealth and has tried to empathize with Mugabe. </p><p>In his first public statement in Nigeria on Zimbabwe </p><p>on March 29, Obasanjo expressed understanding for </p><p>Mugabe adding cryptically, but nonetheless </p><p>disturbingly, that he "shared some of the political </p><p>views" of Zimbabwe\'s ruler. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>DEBT RELIEF -- TELL US WHAT YOU REALLY THINK </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Abruptly changing the course of discussion, </p><p>Obasanjo declared that debt relief had become a sore </p><p>spot for him. "I have gone all around the world for </p><p>three years talking about this, but have not gotten </p><p>one cent in debt relief," he chafed. He recalled </p><p>encouraging discussions with POTUS last May about 10 </p><p>percent debt reduction based on a "debt reduction- </p><p>environment" swap.  When Ambassador Jeter reminded him </p><p>the concept was not viable because of oil company </p><p>opposition, Obasanjo responded that the USG should </p><p>simply write off the debt. The amount we owe the U.S. </p><p>was small and amounted to little more than an irritant </p><p>between two friendly nations. "Write it off, and let </p><p>me take on the other countries on their own," he </p><p>advised. Batagarawa commented that his meetings in </p><p>Washington last December gave him the impression that </p><p>the USG was willing to provide debt relief given </p><p>Nigeria\'s positive role in the post 9/11 world. </p><p>Obasanjo postulated that if the USG could manage to </p><p>work with Pakistan\'s military government on that </p><p>country\'s debt, Washington should be able work with a </p><p>democratic Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) When Ambassador Jeter countered that the road </p><p>to debt relief required continued cooperation with the </p><p>IMF, Obasanjo bristled, "Oh, come on. I have worked </p><p>with them for three years and have gotten nothing." </p><p>Continuing more heatedly, he stated, "When a parent </p><p>wants to encourage a child, he gives a little piece of </p><p>candy for doing something right.  Is the IMF telling </p><p>me I have done nothing right in three years?" </p><p>Springing from his chair, the President murmured "this </p><p>is the sort of thing that annoys me." Pausing after </p><p>taking a few steps toward the door, he declared in </p><p>what seemed to be more a fit of personal agitation </p><p>than a matter of national policy, "To hell with the </p><p>IMF!"  On that note, the meeting ended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The meeting was vintage Obasanjo, with his </p><p>demeanor noticeably waxing and waning depending on the </p><p>subject. The discussion was useful in getting him to </p><p>focus on the military assistance relationship and </p><p>keeping that important cooperation on track. With </p><p>Batagarawa working more actively to bring the </p><p>ammunition depot safety assessments to fruition, we </p><p>are quickly seeing tangible benefits from that </p><p>discussion.  Obasanjo\'s statements regarding Zimbabwe </p><p>suggest that, while Nigeria may still be engaged </p><p>diplomatically, he personally is not considering any </p><p>heavy lifting to move Mugabe toward political </p><p>reconciliation at present. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) On debt relief, Obasanjo apparently is feeling </p><p>the need for electoral deliverables.  Critics have </p><p>publicly chastised him for taking 89 overseas trips </p><p>during his tenure thus far.  He would like to silence </p><p>them and win some voters by saying the money for the </p><p>trips was well spent because Nigeria had achieved debt </p><p>relief not provided other debtor nations.  This would </p><p>signal that Western creditors had bestowed on Nigeria </p><p>a special status primarily due to Obasanjo. For him, </p><p>the issue now may have become more political and </p><p>emotional than economic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) During Canadian PM Chretien\'s visit here last </p><p>week, Obasanjo made debt relief the centerpiece of his </p><p>public statement on Chretien\'s visit. Obasanjo </p><p>sincerely believes Nigeria is entitled to relief and </p><p>will continue to press for special treatment </p><p>regardless of the paucity of major macro-economic </p><p>reforms his Government has actually implemented. We </p><p>have always contended that debt relief was at the </p><p>center of Obasanjo\'s foreign policy toward the West; </p><p>that contention is probably more compelling now than </p><p>ever. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
