(U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Delta Petroleum and the MFA confirmed to us that the </p><p>GOT had given final approval for the pending SOMO-Delta </p><p>barter deal (reftels), under which SOMO will export fuel oil </p><p>to Turkey in return for Turkish benzine (gasoline) and LPG. </p><p>Delta Petroleum officials told us June 25 that 33 trucks </p><p>crossed the border into Iraq on June 21 without incident, </p><p>loaded Iraqi fuel oil at the Bayji oil refinery on June </p><p>24-25, and began the return to Turkey on June 25.  (Note: </p><p>Delta has complained of local Kurdish groups charging an exit </p><p>tax from Iraq, which will be reported septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Delta official said he estimates that Iraqi </p><p>refineries running at full capacity would produce </p><p>approximately 90,000 tonnes of fuel oil per day.  Since the </p><p>refineries were or likely soon would be running at about half </p><p>capacity, they would be producing about 45,000 tonnes of fuel </p><p>oil per day.  The Delta official estimated that Turkey\'s </p><p>trucking industry had capacity to import (for export to third </p><p>countries) roughly 10,000 tonnes of Iraqi fuel oil per day; </p><p>the rest, he said, Iraq would have to export through the </p><p>south.  The official noted that Delta was paying for the fuel </p><p>oil with Turkish LPG and gasoline, which the company had been </p><p>shipping to Iraq without incident for several weeks. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
