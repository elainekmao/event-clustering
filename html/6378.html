<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001660 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1546 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1364 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson.  Reason: 1.5 </p><p>(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Late afternoon March 14 President Sezer approved AK </p><p>leader Erdogan\'s cabinet list and sent it to the Turkish </p><p>Parliament for consideration and eventual vote of confidence. </p><p> Erdogan is now officially Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Erdogan\'s new cabinet is largely the same as that of </p><p>his predecessor Abdullah Gul, with the following changes: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The number of State Ministers has been cut to three; </p><p>portfolios not announced yet; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Former P.M. Gul will now serve as both Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister and Foreign Minister, replacing the hapless and </p><p>stale Yasar Yakis; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Former Deputy P. M. Ertugrul Yalcinbayir is out. </p><p>Yalcinbayir openly opposed and worked against the AK </p><p>Government\'s March 1 petition to authorize deployment of U.S. </p><p>troops to Turkey and Turkish troops abroad; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Huseyin Celik, a Gul ally, and former ANAP member Erkan </p><p>Mumcu swapped positions -- with Celik now at Education and </p><p>Mumcu -- a lightning rod of liberal reformism and a staunch </p><p>critic of the Kemalist State -- moving over to the less </p><p>sensitive Culture Ministry; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Kursat Tuzmen -- the former MHPer who as State Minister </p><p>for Foreign Trade paid a controversial Jan. 12 visit to </p><p>Saddam -- is now Minister of the Environment, replacing Imdat </p><p>Sutluoglu, now out of the Cabinet; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Notably, Ali Babacan hung on to his post as State Minister </p><p>for the Treasury -- despite intense speculation that he was </p><p>heading for the axe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The experienced, level-headed Naksibendi trio of Cemil </p><p>Cicek, Abdulkadir Aksu and Vecdi Gonul -- all of whom </p><p>recognize the importance of good relations with the United </p><p>States -- retain their posts at Justice, Interior and </p><p>Defense, respectively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>What\'s Next </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Erdogan interpreter Egemen Bagis told us immediately </p><p>after the announcement that the Parliament will remain in </p><p>session throughout the weekend and thus could hold a vote of </p><p>confidence as early as Monday, March 17, but more likely by </p><p>the middle of that week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: The limited shake-up ran counter to the bulk </p><p>of the speculation in the past week -- except that offered </p><p>privately to us by AK\'s unofficial godfather Korkut Ozal, who </p><p>cautioned Erdogan against big changes early on (ref A).  In </p><p>any event, Erdogan was elected to Parliament March 9 and is </p><p>moving rapidly into position (ref B).  However, it is unclear </p><p>as to what this portends for his Government\'s willingness or </p><p>ability to push rapidly another troop deployment decision. </p><p>Bagis offered his "personal view" to us that Erdogan had </p><p>taken a big risk and failed on the deployment resolution </p><p>March 1, and that therefore before he does anything else on </p><p>this front he needs to: 1) win a confidence vote and thereby </p><p>2) prepare the groundwork for an overwhelming victory on any </p><p>new resolution. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
