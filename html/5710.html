<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000195 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, BM, NLD, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: NLD CEREMONY PROVIDES PLATFORM FOR PEOPLES\' </p><p>PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 185 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  The National League for Democracy and </p><p>other opposition parties represented by the Committee </p><p>Representing the People\'s Parliament (CRPP) celebrated </p><p>Burma\'s Union Day on February 12 at NLD headquarters.  In </p><p>this first ever CRPP public celebration of a national </p><p>holiday, the growing ranks of the CRPP called on the regime </p><p>to live up to its pledge to enter into dialogue with the </p><p>opposition for political change.  The SPDC also held an event </p><p>commemorating Union Day and stated that the military </p><p>government continues to pursue peace and tranquillity as a </p><p>prerequisite to political change.  The public display of </p><p>ethnic political solidarity at the CRPP event was a high </p><p>point for its members, and a test of the regime\'s toleration </p><p>for dissenting political opinion.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>NLD Celebration Brings Out Ethnic Show of Support </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In spite of the regime\'s recent arrests and </p><p>harassment of political activists, members of the Committee </p><p>Representing the People\'s Parliament (CRPP) showed up in </p><p>force on February 12 at National League for Democracy </p><p>headquarters to celebrate Burma\'s Union Day.  NLD and CRPP </p><p>Chairman U Aung Shwe kicked off the event stating that it was </p><p>a CRPP, not NLD, celebration (the CRPP\'s first ever public </p><p>celebration of a national holiday).  Dozens of Members of </p><p>Parliament Elect, most of whom have served months if not </p><p>years in prison for their political activities, were crowded </p><p>into the headquarters building, joined by diplomats including </p><p>the U.S. Charge d\'Affaires, the Ambassadors of Great Britain, </p><p>Italy, and Australia, UN representatives and the press. </p><p>Hundreds of supporters (and a contingent of the regime\'s </p><p>military intelligence) on the street in front of the building </p><p>listened as the words of Aung San Suu Kyi and the leaders of </p><p>several other political parties represented by the CRPP were </p><p>broadcast out from the meeting hall. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The speeches by ASSK, the CRPP and leaders of </p><p>specific political parties all carried a common theme:  1) </p><p>the "union" of Burmese nationalities engineered by General </p><p>Aung San in 1947 is under siege due to the divisive policies </p><p>of the SPDC and its predecessors; 2) current conditions - the </p><p>lack of human rights, discrimination against ethnic </p><p>nationalities, and economic hardships - are untenable and </p><p>require political change; and 3) the SPDC must follow through </p><p>on its stated commitment to begin political dialogue, the </p><p>only solution to these problems.  While this is the standard </p><p>refrain for the NLD, it is significant that, through the </p><p>CRPP, a broader coalition of political representatives are </p><p>now able to make the appeal in public. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  For the record, CRPP membership has continued to </p><p>expand over the past few months and now includes </p><p>representatives of the following parties that won seats in </p><p>the 1990 elections: the NLD, the Shan NLD, the Union Pa-o </p><p>National Organization, the Arakan League for Democracy, the </p><p>Zomi League for Democracy, the Democratic Party, the Party </p><p>for National Democracy, the National Democratic Party for </p><p>Human Rights, the Kamans NLD, the Mon National Democratic </p><p>Front, and two independent MP\'s-elect.  Only the first three </p><p>of these parties are still legally registered, the rest were </p><p>deregistered by the regime shortly after the elections and </p><p>have since been considered "illegal." </p><p> </p><p>SPDC Event Focuses On More of the Same </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The SPDC celebrated Union Day with a flag ceremony, </p><p>the naming of a white elephant, the positioning of a giant </p><p>alms bowl at the regime pagoda on Mindhamma Hill and a dinner </p><p>for USDA and SPDC officials.  The flag ceremony is a </p><p>tradition handed down from the Ne Win era when a Union of </p><p>Burma flag with the 1947 Panglong Agreement attached in a </p><p>holder was taken to each of the seven states and divisions. </p><p>The SPDC ceremony takes a Union Flag to four points in the </p><p>city (elapsed time approximately 40 minutes) before it is </p><p>raised in front of city hall.  The white elephant is the </p><p>third addition to a white elephant park the regime created </p><p>about two years ago.  The white elephant is a sign of good </p><p>luck and prosperity for the country.  The giant alms bowl was </p><p>fabricated in Mandalay and has been ceremoniously transported </p><p>to Rangoon by the regime, collecting donations at every stop. </p><p> The placement of the alms bowl at the foot of the regime </p><p>pagoda and alabaster Buddha image at Mindhamma Hill is </p><p>intended to gain merit. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  In the evening, Senior General Than Shwe hosted a </p><p>reception and dinner at the President\'s Residence Compound </p><p>for SPDC officials, USDA representatives from state and </p><p>divisions, various governmental NGOs, and traditional </p><p>cultural troop members from states and the Tenassarim </p><p>Division.  The press release on the event also notes that </p><p>leaders of national races were in attendance, but it does not </p><p>identify who those leaders were.  The stated objectives of </p><p>the SPDC\'s  Union Day activities were "for all nationals to </p><p>safeguard the national policy - non-disintegration of the </p><p>Union, non-disintegration of the national solidarity, and </p><p>perpetuation of sovereignty; to keep the Union Spirit alive </p><p>and flourishing among the entire people; for all nationals to </p><p>strive in harmony for the emergence of an enduring State </p><p>constitution that will pave the way for the building of a new </p><p>discipline-flourishing democratic nation and to ward off, </p><p>with national unity, the danger of destructionists from </p><p>inside and outside the nation who are disturbing the </p><p>stability, peace, modernization and development of the </p><p>State."  In short, no changes from previous years; stay the </p><p>course and do not make waves. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Comment:  The CRPP\'s public celebration of Union Day </p><p>was a high point for the elected leaders of ethnic parties </p><p>since they were stripped of their positions in 1990.  There </p><p>was a definite air of excitement as these leaders spoke out </p><p>on the injustices their people currently live under and </p><p>called on the regime to work together for political change. </p><p>However, given the regime\'s past actions against the CRPP </p><p>(almost all were arrested in 1998 when the CRPP was formed) </p><p>and recent arrests and harassment of political activists (see </p><p>reftel) this may be a short-lived high.  Nevertheless, the </p><p>SPDC is allowing the CRPP to continue to function at this </p><p>time.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
