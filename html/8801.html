<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 002668 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KPAL, PREL, PTER, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: HALTING ASSISTANCE TO HAMAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 157973 </p><p>     B. STATE 163613 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador called on Kuwait\'s First Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmed June 17 to </p><p>register U.S. views on the need to shut down all types of </p><p>support for Hamas.  Drawing on points in ref (a) and </p><p>non-paper in ref (b), Ambassador emphasized that the U.S. </p><p>wanted to work with all the states in the region to bring </p><p>peace to Palestinians.  Hamas, unfortunately, was a direct </p><p>threat to this goal and it was important for the U.S. to work </p><p>with its friends in the region to block funds that are, in </p><p>many cases, sent to Hamas in the misguided belief that it was </p><p>supporting bona fide charity. He emphasized as well that the </p><p>U.S. freeze on assets of six individuals and four </p><p>organizations would be imposed on Thursday, June 19, and he </p><p>asked for Kuwaiti support and similar action. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Sabah replied that the U.S. could be sure that Kuwait </p><p>supported the goal of staunching the flow of money to </p><p>terrorist organizations.  Known Hamas members, such as Khalid </p><p>Meshaal, were persona non grata in Kuwait.  Shaykh Sabah was </p><p>unaware of any actual Hamas activities in Kuwait, but he said </p><p>that the government had already given instructions to all of </p><p>its agencies to ensure that charitable contributions were, in </p><p>fact, channeled through verifiably charitable organizations. </p><p>Hamas was not one of those and the government would certainly </p><p>oppose any use of Hamas as a financial channel into the </p><p>territories.  He asked in addition that the U.S. provide any </p><p>additional information to the Kuwaitis on activities that it </p><p>believes might be going on in Kuwait.  If this information is </p><p>available, the GOK will certainly act, Sabah assured the </p><p>Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On Palestinian-Israeli issues, Sabah said he was now </p><p>more hopeful than he had been in a long time.  He sensed that </p><p>both sides might now be ready to come to an agreement. While </p><p>he acknowledged that the Arabs had a role to play with the </p><p>Palestinians.  He underscored the need for firm U.S. </p><p>treatment of the Israelis.  The Ambassador reminded Sabah </p><p>that the President had already been quite critical in his </p><p>comments about the Israeli attack on Rantissi.  He said that </p><p>the U.S. was fully committed to the roadmap and we were </p><p>looking for full partners to push it forward. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Finally, the Ambassador emphasized that the issue of </p><p>support for terrorist organizations was extremely sensitive </p><p>in the U.S.  Assistant Secretary Burns had been questioned </p><p>sharply on Arab activities in this regard during his recent </p><p>testimony before the House International Relations Committee </p><p>on June 12.  It was crucial for Kuwait to keep its reputation </p><p>intact on the Hill by taking serious steps against Hamas </p><p>quickly. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
