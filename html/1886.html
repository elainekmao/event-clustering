<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002074 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>DEA HQS FOR OFE </p><p>LAGOS FOR USSS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/13/2011 </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, NI, PGOV, SNAR </p><p>SUBJECT: THE BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE: NIGERIA\'S DRUG </p><p>CERTIFICATION AT MID-YEAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1547 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U)  Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  Summary:  The March 1, 2001 drug certification of </p><p>Nigeria appears to have had the unintended consequence of </p><p>lulling top Nigerian law enforcement officials into a </p><p>counter-narcotics complacency.  Unless the NDLEA\'s </p><p>operational efforts are revitalized quickly by its current </p><p>Chairman and funded more generously by a reluctant federal </p><p>government, Nigeria will have to struggle to meet established </p><p>requirements by year,s end. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C)  Five months after Nigeria received its first narcotics </p><p>certification in seven years, top GON policy-makers appear </p><p>lethargic in their moves to implement more aggressive drug </p><p>enforcement efforts to ensure renewed certification in 2002. </p><p>The false belief that certification has been obtained </p><p>indefinitely appears pervasive.  President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>surprise to learn that certification is an annual process, </p><p>after recently being told of the impending USG review by the </p><p>Ambassador (reftel), is indicative of this false confidence. </p><p>The NDLEA Chairman is acutely aware of the need for progress, </p><p>however, and has written to Obasanjo to make that point. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C)  Meanwhile, the country\'s sole drug enforcement agency, </p><p>the NDLEA, has produced unimpressive results. So far this </p><p>year, no major traffickers have been investigated, arrested </p><p>or prosecuted.  Seizures of hard drugs are less significant </p><p>than in the past few years.  Money laundering remains largely </p><p>unchecked as highlighted by the FATF\'s June 2001 declaration </p><p>of Nigeria as a "non-cooperating" country in international </p><p>efforts to fight money laundering.  The NDLEA\'s "Joint Task </p><p>Force" set up to cooperate with DEA on major drug cases is </p><p>moribund. Nigeria\'s largest ports -- Lagos\' Apapa and Tin Can </p><p>Island -- remain off limits to the NDLEA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) The NDLEA would prefer to cast Nigeria\'s drug </p><p>trafficking situation as improving, with traffickers moving </p><p>to off-shore bases and increasingly avoiding Nigeria as a </p><p>transit area.  This theory is often espoused by the NDLEA </p><p>Chairman and the Attorney General and rationalizes the </p><p>limited drug enforcement gains made in Nigeria so far this </p><p>year.  Reality as depicted by information available to DEA </p><p>and others, however, is far less sanguine.  Large quantities </p><p>of heroin and cocaine, often in loads over 100 kilograms, </p><p>continue to enter Nigeria from Southwest and Southeast Asia </p><p>and Latin America before being parceled out in smaller </p><p>quantities for delivery to US and European markets. </p><p>Continued arrests of Nigerian drug couriers made around the </p><p>world provides confirmation that many drug rings remained </p><p>centered or tied to Nigeria, though it is true that some may </p><p>now operate largely in other countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Extradition - The Forgotten Issue </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) With the sensational November 2000 rendition to U.S. </p><p>justice of four fugitives, including two drug traffickers on </p><p>the U.S. President\'s List of Major Drug Kingpins, the </p><p>perceived need to cooperate with the USG on the requested </p><p>extradition of 18 other fugitives appears to have waned. </p><p>Some senior GON officials may have perceived the USG\'s </p><p>reluctance to accept additional extrajudicial renditions as a </p><p>sign of flagging US emphasis on extraditions.  The emphasis </p><p>we have placed on the long-term building of an efficient </p><p>extradition mechanism respectful of due process could have </p><p>been misinterpreted as a sign of diminished USG interest in </p><p>seeing fugitives turned over for U.S. prosecution.  Though </p><p>pledges are plenty from the Attorney General on making this </p><p>goal a reality, there has been no discernible movement </p><p>towards selecting prosecutors for a dedicated MOJ </p><p>"extradition unit" or a judge to hear extradition cases </p><p>exclusively.   Similarly, there has been no move to initiate </p><p>new proceedings against the several fugitives subject to </p><p>outstanding USG extradition requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Airport Interdiction - The One Bright Spot </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) The silver lining to NDLEA\'s otherwise lackluster </p><p>performance is the dramatically improved drug interdiction </p><p>posture at Lagos\' Murtala Muhammed International Airport </p><p>(MMIA).  Armed with two "Itemiser" drug detection scanners </p><p>donated by INL in February as well as an existing body X-ray </p><p>machine (to detect drug couriers carrying narcotics </p><p>internally) the 50-man NDLEA team at MMIA is presenting a </p><p>strong deterrent to trafficking through West Africa\'s busiest </p><p>airport.  The South African Airways/Nigeria Airways non-stop </p><p>flight from Lagos to New York is virtually drug-free, with </p><p>only one confirmed drug seizure at New York/JFK since the </p><p>flight started in February -- thanks to the 100 percent </p><p>screening of passengers and baggage of the NDLEA airport </p><p>unit.  This is no small accomplishment, especially </p><p>considering the frequency of drug arrests made when Nigeria </p><p>Airways operated a New York/JFK non-stop flight in the early </p><p>1990\'s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) Using INL funds, Post hopes to further strengthen the </p><p>NDLEA airport unit by providing two more "Itemisers," a </p><p>vehicle and VHF radios (the unit currently has none).  The </p><p>Ambassador has weighed in with the Minister of Aviation to </p><p>obtained a higher ceiling on the number of NDLEA personnel </p><p>authorized to work at the Lagos airport - crucial to the </p><p>adequate screening on the New York and other international </p><p>flights. Additional assistance will aim to improve the </p><p>NDLEA\'s interdiction efforts at the Lagos seaports ) </p><p>contingent on the NDLEA gaining access to these ports through </p><p>a legislative amendment - and invigorate investigations </p><p>against major traffickers in collaboration with DEA. DEA </p><p>believes that more assistance from our side ) assistance </p><p>that has already been discussed -- could further improve </p><p>Nigeria\'s performance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment: The USG must continue to push the Nigerians </p><p>to fully fund the NDLEA while fulfilling our own promises to </p><p>help the GON increase narcotics enforcement effectiveness. </p><p>The DEA Lagos office remains understaffed, making joint </p><p>operations difficult to conduct.  Furthermore, we continue to </p><p>seek Congressional approval for the vetted unit that we </p><p>promised the Nigerians, a key component to successful </p><p>enforcement. We have not yet fulfilled our own base-line </p><p>commitment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Greater NDLEA Funding ) The Bottom Line </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) Of course, the GON must also support NDLEA more </p><p>substantially. The Ambassador personally lobbied President </p><p>Obsanjo for a reinstatement of the Nigerian FY01 </p><p>Supplementary Budget allocation for the NDLEA after receiving </p><p>reports that an original 2.2 billion Naira figure had been </p><p>whittled down to 250 million (USD 2.2 million) by the </p><p>Presidency.   As reported in Reftel, Obasanjo pledged to </p><p>double the amount, to 500 million, which would be the largest </p><p>budget ever received by the NDLEA.  (Note: Chairman Lafiaji </p><p>and his National Assembly supporters have confided the </p><p>initial 2.2 billion Naira request was far more than they had </p><p>hoped to received and more than the NDLEA needed.  End Note.) </p><p>  To date, the funding has not been delivered and the NDLEA </p><p>appears to be living "hand-to-mouth" with its Chairman taking </p><p>out personal loans to make sure his men have adequate housing </p><p>and benefits. (Comment: Most GON entities are not receiving </p><p>allocations on time as the GON tries to stem inflation and </p><p>currency devaluation by holding back disbursements to </p><p>agencies. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) Last year the emphasis for certification was on </p><p>extradition or rendition of fugitives from U.S. Justice.  We </p><p>believe the emphasis this year should be on adequate funding </p><p>for the NDLEA, to allow it to fulfill Nigeria,s obligations </p><p>under the 1988 UN Convention and to meet the USG\'s </p><p>certification benchmarks.  We should hold the Presidency </p><p>responsible for funding Nigeria\'s drug control effort as a </p><p>sign of the GON\'s commitment to sustain a robust </p><p>counter-narcotics effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Our pushing the Nigerians to fully fund the NDLEA should </p><p>be accompanied by vigorous, targeted efforts to help the GON </p><p>increase NDLEA,s effectiveness. DEA,s Lagos office remains </p><p>understaffed, making joint operations difficult to conduct. </p><p>Furthermore, we continue to seek Congressional approval for </p><p>the vetted unit that we promised the Nigerians, a key </p><p>component to successful enforcement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Nigeria remains a major international drug </p><p>trafficking hub with an anemic threat of arrest and </p><p>prosecution for traffickers.  The NDLEA, lacking the </p><p>budgetary backing it needs from the GON, has not yet been </p><p>able to pass the test of persuasive performance. The proposed </p><p>visit to Abuja of a USG law enforcement delegation and the </p><p>first meeting of the Bilateral Law Enforcement Committee will </p><p>afford us a good opportunity to underscore the need for </p><p>improvement, in particular for the GON to fully fund NDLEA </p><p>requirements. We propose that the bilateral take place in </p><p>early to-mid-November to allow the GON time to pursue the </p><p>certification agenda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) In the interim, the Embassy will push the GON to </p><p>take necessary steps, but we must simultaneously redeem our </p><p>own pledges. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
