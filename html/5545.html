Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  TERROR WARNING IN THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>(Sabah)  The Turkish Armed Forces continue to </p><p>dispatch additional troops to the Iraqi border. </p><p>Meanwhile, the National Security Directorate warned </p><p>the 81 provincial security directorates against </p><p>possible terrorist attacks.  The report calls for </p><p>intense security measures alongside routes used for </p><p>military dispatch to the Southeast.  Major </p><p>terrorist organizations mentioned were the Marxist- </p><p>Leninist Communist Party (MLKP) and PKK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  WAR MEETING IN DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Milliyet)  The "Rain Operation Plan," devised to </p><p>prevent a population movement and provide </p><p>humanitarian assistance in the event of a possible </p><p>operation against Iraq, was tabled again during a </p><p>February 4 meeting in Diyarbakir.  Second Army </p><p>Commander General Fevzi Turkeri, Regional Governor </p><p>Gokhan Aydiner, Seventh Corps Command Lieutenant </p><p>General Atilla Isik, and the governors of </p><p>Diyarbakir, Mardin, Sirnak, Batman, Van, and </p><p>Hakkari provinces, which have been tasked with </p><p>first-degree duties, as well as the governors of 21 </p><p>other provinces who will give support to these six </p><p>provinces, attended the meeting.  Officials from </p><p>the Directorates of Red Crescent, Public Works, </p><p>Health, National Education, Civil Defense, and </p><p>Tele-com were also present.  Turkeri, Aydiner, the </p><p>governors and officials will watch a February 5 </p><p>humanitarian assistance exercise at Sirnak\'s Habur </p><p>border gate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  MILITARY INSPECTION AT INCIRLIK AIR BASE </p><p>(Hurriyet)  A three-day general inspection began at </p><p>Incirlik (Adana) Air Base\'s Tenth Tanker Command as </p><p>of February 4.  An alarm was given for the Turkish </p><p>personnel there as part of ordinary annual </p><p>inspections.  During inspections, high-level </p><p>military officials from Ankara observed to see if </p><p>sufficient security measures had been taken against </p><p>any attacks.  Efforts will be exerted to eliminate </p><p>any shortcomings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMANDOES IN NORTHERN IRAQ </p><p>(Hurriyet/Radikal/Milliyet/Tercuman)  Additional </p><p>forces have been dispatched to support Turkish </p><p>military units deployed in northern Iraq to prevent </p><p>the infiltration of PKK terrorists during a </p><p>possible influx of refugees in the event of a war </p><p>in Iraq.  Military vehicles transported commando </p><p>units to Uludere (Sirnak) along the Iraqi border. </p><p>They then crossed into northern Iraq to assume </p><p>assigned duties there.  Based on intelligence that </p><p>there are around 500 (PKK) terrorists in Iraq\'s </p><p>Sinaht Valley across from Uludere, security forces </p><p>are preparing for a large-scale operation. </p><p>Military officials said leaves had been suspended </p><p>to be ready for an operation as the U.S. was </p><p>expected to launch its possible operation against </p><p>Iraq between February 15-27.  Radikal pointed to </p><p>expedited war preparations in military and civilian </p><p>bureaucracy, with leaves suspended at the Ministry </p><p>of Foreign Affairs, as well as critical military </p><p>units.  Mobilization duty order files have been </p><p>updated.  Security measures have been elevated in </p><p>such public institutions as MKE, TUPRAS, PETKIM, </p><p>TEDAS, GAP, and around dams.  Milli Gazete reported </p><p>the dispatch by train of heavy military equipment, </p><p>including tanks, canons, and munitions, from the </p><p>Trakya region to the Iraqi border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  FEAR OF WAR </p><p>(Tercuman)  People in the Southeast have begun to </p><p>take measures in preparation for a possible war in </p><p>Iraq.  They have begun to prepare apartment </p><p>basements or rooms in their apartments against </p><p>chemical weapons attacks.  Residents of Kiziltepe </p><p>(Mardin) have reportedly already prepared basements </p><p>for a possible (chemical) attack.  Cumhuriyet </p><p>reported there were no civilian (war) preparations </p><p>in the Southeast, just military build-up. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  FOUR HIZBULLAH SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN MARDIN </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  Acting a tip, the Mardin Security </p><p>Directorate\'s Anti-Terror teams arrested four </p><p>suspected members of Hizbullah\'s Ilim (Science) </p><p>Group in Mardin.  Interrogation of the arrestees </p><p>continues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  SWEDISH FOREIGN MINISTER IN DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Sabah/Hurriyet/Tercuman)  Swedish Foreign Minister </p><p>Anna Lindh, whom the former government of Bulent </p><p>Ecevit had refused to give permission to travel to </p><p>Diyarbakir, flew to Diyarbakir on a private plane </p><p>of the Swedish Air Force.  Diyarbakir Governor </p><p>Ahmet Cemil Serhadli met Lindh when she arrived at </p><p>Diyarbakir\'s Second Tactic Air Base.  In </p><p>Diyarbakir, Lindh visited the Women\'s Center </p><p>(KAMER), where she was briefed on KAMER activities. </p><p>Lindh later donated USD 25,000 to the Center\'s </p><p>Honor Killings Prevention Project.  Lindh said she </p><p>was visiting Diyarbakir due to its economic and </p><p>political problems.  After her meeting with AK </p><p>Party leader Erdogan in Ankara, Lindh quoted </p><p>Erdogan as saying she would see many changes in the </p><p>region during her next visit to Diyarbakir. </p><p>Erdogan had reportedly told her the AK Party </p><p>government would make more investments in the </p><p>region.  Cumhuriyet cited Lindh as saying the </p><p>(Turkish) government had given assurances that it </p><p>would display zero tolerance for torture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  BAS CONCERNED OVER DIE\'S INFLATION FIGURE FOR </p><p>JANUARY </p><p>(Milliyet)  Adana Chamber of Commerce President </p><p>Saban Bas evaluated the State Statistics </p><p>Institute\'s (DIE) inflation figure for the month of </p><p>January.  Bas said the figure had shown that no </p><p>concessions should be made regarding (the </p><p>government\'s) economic policies.  "The government </p><p>must take all measures to prevent the inflation </p><p>disease from spreading," he added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.

Republican </p><p>People\'s Party (CHP) Mersin Deputy Vahit Cekmez and </p><p>Mersin Mayor Macit Ozcan attended the inauguration </p><p>ceremony.
