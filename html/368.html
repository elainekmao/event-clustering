<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RIYADH 05215 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, UR, SA, ECON </p><p>SUBJECT:  BACKGROUND ON SAUDI VISITOR TARIQ BIN LADEN AND </p><p>BIN LADEN COMPANIES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  MOSCOW 19452 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT). </p><p> </p><p>2.  POST THANKS MOSCOW FOR ITS INTERESTING REPORT </p><p>(REFTEL). TO PROVIDE A CONTEXT FOR THE "IZVESTIYA" </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH TARIQ BIN LADEN AND ITS IMPACT ON SAUDI </p><p>SOVIET TIES, POST PROVIDES FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON TARIQ </p><p>AND THE BIN LADEN BUSINESS COMPANIES IN GENERAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE BIN LADEN COMPANIES ARE AMONG THE LARGEST </p><p>CONSTRUCTION FIRMS IN SAUDI ARABIA, WITH ESTIMATED </p><p>HOLDINGS OF SAUDI RIYALS 38 BILLION ($10 BILLION).  BIN </p><p>LADEN HAS THUS FAR CONCENTRATED ON INVESTMENT WITHIN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, THOUGH THEY ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS JOINT </p><p>VENTURES WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN COMPANIES.  THE </p><p>COMPANIES ARE ESSENTIALLY FAMILY-RUN: SEVEN OF THE BIN </p><p>LADEN BROTHERS FULLY CONTROL THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. </p><p>THEIR BUSINESS REPUTATION IS CONSIDERED EXCELLENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SAG AND THE BIN LADEN </p><p>COMPANIES IS A STRONG ONE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BIN </p><p>LADEN\'S FAMILY TIES TO THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE </p><p>COMPANIES\' LEADING ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE KINGDOM\'S </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE.  WHEN THE COMPANIES\' FOUNDER, SHAYKH </p><p>MOHAMMED BIN LADEN DIED IN 1966, KING FAISAL SET UP A </p><p>SORT OF ROYAL CHARTER FOR THE COMPANY WHICH KEPT THE </p><p>COMPANY AFLOAT BY GUARANTEEING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND </p><p>SETTING UP A SPECIAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ADMINISTER THE </p><p>COMPANY UNTIL THE BIN LADEN SONS CAME OF AGE.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO ENTRUSTED BIN LADEN WITH A MAJOR </p><p>SHARE IN THE RENOVATION OF THE TWO HOLY MOSQUES IN MECCA </p><p>AND MADINAH.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE FIRMS\' NUMBER TWO </p><p>MAN, SHAYKH BAKR BIN LADEN, HAS DIRECT PERSONAL TIES WITH </p><p>KING FAHD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TARIQ M. BIN LADEN IS NOT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS </p><p>OF THE BIN LADEN COMPANIES, THOUGH HE DOES RUN A LARGE </p><p>SUBSIDIARY BRANCH.  LIKE HIS BROTHERS, TARIQ MAINTAINS </p><p>CLOSE RELATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.  AT 43, </p><p>HE IS ONE OF THE ELDEST BROTHERS OF THE BIN LADEN CLAN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  BECAUSE OF TARIQ\'S SENIOR POSITION AMONG </p><p>THE BIN LADEN ELITE AND HIS TIES TO THE ROYAL FAMILY, HIS </p><p>VISIT TO MOSCOW MAY BE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THAT OF A </p><p>SIMPLE BUSINESS VISIT.  IT IS LIKELY THAT HE CONSULTED </p><p>WITH SAG OFFICIALS BEFORE LEAVING THE KINGDOM AND WILL </p><p>REPORT BACK TO THEM UPON HIS RETURN.  TARIQ MAY ENVISION </p><p>A ROLE FOR HIMSELF IN FUTURE FINANCIAL COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN THE USSR AND THE ARAB BUSINESS COMMUNITY THROUGH </p><p>HIS CORPORATE TIES WITH THE SAUDI-CAIRO BANK. </p><p> </p><p>7.  A CLOSER CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SAG AND MOSCOW IS NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY A NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT.  AN INCREASED SAUDI </p><p>PRESENCE AMONG THE MUSLIM POPULATIONS THROUGH ECONOMIC </p><p>AND RELIGIOUS TIES COULD ACT AS A GUARD AGAINST IRANIAN </p><p>INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  NOTE: WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN A COPY OF TARIQ\'S </p><p>SPEECH AND WILL SEND IT TO MOSCOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FREEMAN. </p><p></p></div>
