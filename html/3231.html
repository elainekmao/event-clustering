<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 TEGUCIGALPA 001927 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL/C DAVID LUNA AND JOHN BRANDOLINO, FOR AID </p><p>EXO/WHA JOHN SMITH AND FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KJUS, KCRM, KSEP, PGOV, EAID, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN </p><p>HONDURAS </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) 02 STATE 90733 </p><p>       (B) TEGUCIGALPA 01811 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This cable responds to the action requested in </p><p>Reftel. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  Over the course of the last three years, </p><p>there has been considerable activity in the battle </p><p>against corruption in Honduras, in which the government </p><p>of Honduras (GOH), civil society and the private sector </p><p>have been involved.  Anticorruption efforts are a Mission </p><p>Program Plan priority for Post, and they are an important </p><p>cornerstone of U.S. diplomatic undertakings in Honduras. </p><p>As a result of these efforts, public awareness has been </p><p>heightened and the GOH has taken steps to both identify </p><p>and address the problem of corruption.  While the fight </p><p>against corruption rages on, there are concrete successes </p><p>attributable to USG technical assistance and bilateral </p><p>diplomatic efforts.  We provide here brief descriptions </p><p>of the various anticorruption projects and activities, </p><p>along with summary assessments of their achievements. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Many of the anticorruption efforts described herein </p><p>are components of various Hurricane Mitch assistance </p><p>programs funded by the May 1999 supplemental--the </p><p>projects are drawing to a close.  Without the additional </p><p>funds, Post will be hard-pressed to continue work in </p><p>furtherance of its anticorruption goals.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>EFFORTS FUNDED BY INL HURRICANE MITCH FUNDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>INL SECURITY MINISTRY ANTICORRUPTION PROJECT </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Public Security Ministry (MoPS) project involved </p><p>three (3) primary components--training, technical </p><p>assistance and the provision of equipment and software. </p><p>To accomplish the anticorruption initiative, the project </p><p>focused on the investigation of financial crimes, as well </p><p>as the development and implementation of a case-tracking </p><p>system.  Courses were taught in investigative techniques, </p><p>report writing and interviewing methods, financial crimes </p><p>auditing and various computer skills.  Hands-on technical </p><p>assistance was provided in the field.  Both computer </p><p>hardware and software was donated so that investigators </p><p>and prosecutors can participate in the National Automated </p><p>Case Management and Information System (NACMIS). </p><p>Additionally, technical assistance was given to the </p><p>Financial Crimes Unit (FCU) to help them develop </p><p>specialized modules to support financial crimes in the </p><p>NACMIS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  As a result of the project, the FCU\'s ability to </p><p>investigate, prosecute and track public corruption and </p><p>financial crime cases is considerably greater.  Moreover, </p><p>the GOH now has the capacity to link this computer system </p><p>with the judicial sector system.  Project funding was </p><p>$150,000 and was managed by ICITAP. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>INL PROCURADOR GENERAL ANTICORRUPTION PROJECT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Honduran Procurador General performs functions </p><p>similar to those performed in the U.S. by the Office of </p><p>the Inspector General and the Office of the Solicitor </p><p>General.  This three-pronged project included the </p><p>provision of training, technical assistance and </p><p>equipment/software.  The project focused on the </p><p>investigation of tax-related financial cases, as well as </p><p>the development and implementation of a case-tracking </p><p>system.  The same types of courses as were taught in the </p><p>MoPS project were also taught in this project.  As in the </p><p>MoPS project, the donation of hardware and software made </p><p>it possible for the Procurador General\'s Office to tap </p><p>into the NACMIS system.  The benefits of the </p><p>anticorruption initiative include a heightened ability to </p><p>handle cases involving tax evasion and the capacity to </p><p>tie into the future judicial computer system.  Project </p><p>funding was $150,000 and was managed by ICITAP. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>INL PUBLIC MINISTRY/IABF PROJECT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Inter-American Bar Foundation (IABF) has a </p><p>$400,000 grant of INL funds (administered by out USAID </p><p>mission)to provide technical assistance and training to </p><p>the Public Ministry (MP--Attorney General\'s Office). The </p><p>project focuses on strengthening the capability of the </p><p>Public Ministry to detect, investigate and prosecute </p><p>public corruption cases (in particular, to prosecute </p><p>successfully under the recently implemented oral </p><p>accusatory judicial system).  The project has three </p><p>components--to increase the effectiveness of the MP in </p><p>the fight against corruption, to form an inter- </p><p>institutional alliance against corruption and to </p><p>strengthen the Citizen Advisory Council (CAC) as an </p><p>anticorruption tool. </p><p> </p><p>8.  First, the project involved the selection of six </p><p>active corruption cases for which prosecutors in the MP\'s </p><p>Anticorruption Unit received specialized training in </p><p>investigative techniques.  Additionally, inter- </p><p>institutional committees were formed to coordinate </p><p>efforts and avoid duplication of services.  Along with </p><p>the MP, the Comptroller General\'s Office, the Directorate </p><p>of Administrative Probity and the Honduran IRS </p><p>participated.  The goal of this training is to teach </p><p>prosecutors how to develop a corruption case from the </p><p>initial investigation through prosecution and trial.  A </p><p>broad-based interagency case-study approach is used to </p><p>encourage agency cooperation.  An inter-institutional </p><p>alliance against corruption was formed, and a final </p><p>report regarding its formation is forthcoming.  The CAC </p><p>(intended to make recommendations for the repeal and </p><p>modification of various immunities enjoyed by public </p><p>officials) has been only marginally successful.  The </p><p>CAC\'s progress is at a standstill, so alternative </p><p>solutions are being pursued. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>INL DIRECTORATE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROBITY PROJECT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Public Affairs Section (PAS) carried out a two- </p><p>year $150,000 anticorruption project in conjunction with </p><p>the Directorate of Administrative Probity (DPA).  The DPA </p><p>serves as the GOH\'s chief ethics watchdog and performs </p><p>some functions that are similar to those performed by the </p><p>Office of Government Ethics.  Approximately $86,000 was </p><p>spent on technology, including a digital copier, </p><p>computers, printers, Oracle database software, licenses </p><p>and technical support and training for DPA staff. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The remainder of the funding was spent on training </p><p>seminars and conferences, both in Honduras and the U.S. </p><p>The training and conferences focused on financial </p><p>government administration, anticorruption in government </p><p>and the private sector, and government ethics.  PAS </p><p>hosted five (5) workshops with presenters recruited by </p><p>State\'s International Information Programs (IIP) Office </p><p>of Speakers and Specialists.  The speakers\' areas of </p><p>expertise included government ethics, anticorruption and </p><p>financial oversight. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>INL MIGRATION COMPUTER PROJECT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  This $217,000 project, currently in the contracting </p><p>phase, is designed to provide computers, modems and other </p><p>hardware to the GOH Office of Migration.  The equipment </p><p>will augment the GOH\'s ability to transmit migration </p><p>information between offices efficiently, and generally </p><p>enhance the record-keeping capabilities of the Migration </p><p>Office.  Moreover, the project to issue Machine Readable </p><p>Passports in Honduras (funded through the 2001 INL Letter </p><p>of Agreement) will dovetail with the Migration Office\'s </p><p>new hardware, making migration and border controls in </p><p>Honduras better than ever.  Post anticipates that both </p><p>projects will be in place before the end of FY 2002. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>USAID COMPTROLLER GENERAL PROJECT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  One of the objectives of USAID\'s Transparency </p><p>Program is to strengthen the capability of the </p><p>Comptroller General of the Republic (CGR) and promote </p><p>enhanced awareness of the importance of audits in </p><p>general.  Several goals have been accomplished, </p><p>including: </p><p> </p><p>-USAID\'s contractor conducted training (most notably to </p><p>the Audit Unit for Projects of International </p><p>Organizations), while overseeing systematic concurrent </p><p>audits of Hurricane Mitch reconstruction projects. </p><p>-The Regional Inspector General certified the CGR to </p><p>perform audits for U.S.-funded programs. </p><p> </p><p>-A Web site for the CGR was designed </p><p>(http://www.cgrh.net/) and assistance was given in the </p><p>publication of final audit reports on the site. </p><p> </p><p>-A much-needed Audit Recommendation Follow-Up System was </p><p>developed in order to promote early and impartial </p><p>resolution of recommendations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THE NATIONAL ANTICORRUPTION COUNCIL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>13.  USAID\'s Transparency Program provides support to the </p><p>National Anticorruption Council (NAC), which was created </p><p>by former President Carlos Flores, reinforced by </p><p>President Maduro and is chaired by Roman Catholic </p><p>Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodriguez.  The objective of the </p><p>NAC is to develop and implement a national anticorruption </p><p>strategy and action plan.  USAID provided financial </p><p>support for civil society events, and financed a public </p><p>opinion survey about corruption, governmental integrity </p><p>and accountability issues.  Results were publicly </p><p>presented and used as a basis for the NAC\'s National </p><p>Anticorruption Strategy.  USAID serves the NAC in an </p><p>advisory role, with emphasis on diagnosing the </p><p>anticorruption problem in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>14.  U.S. funds for the project total $291,665 and are </p><p>managed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). </p><p>Recently, USAID delivered a letter to the Cardinal </p><p>reaffirming its support for NAC\'s activities.  Other </p><p>international donors also support the NAC, including </p><p>Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Interamerican </p><p>Development Bank (IDB), the UNDP and the World Bank. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>USAID MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  USAID supports accountability and transparency at </p><p>the local level through its Municipal Development Program </p><p>(MDP).  The MDP installs formal internal controls on </p><p>municipal accounting/management systems, trains the </p><p>community to oversee the performance of local governments </p><p>and their use of resources, involves citizens in decision </p><p>making processes and in oversight functions, and </p><p>strengthens management systems at the local level. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Using Hurricane Mitch reconstruction funds, Post </p><p>signed a Cooperative Agreement (CA) with the Municipal </p><p>Development Foundation (FUNDEMUN), under which FUNDEMUN </p><p>designs and implements a strategy for social auditing to </p><p>follow-up processes and activities for reconstruction </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>TRANSPARENCY AND GOVERNANCE WORKING GROUP </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  The GOH, civil society and, subsequently, the </p><p>Consultative Group for the Reconstruction and </p><p>Transformation of Honduras (whose members include the </p><p>leading members of the G-15), established a Transparency </p><p>and Good Governance Working Group to address issues of </p><p>government accountability, transparency and corruption. </p><p>Its priorities include immunities laws, social auditing </p><p>and the NAC. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>USAID/GOH/IDB PROCUREMENT INSPECTION PROJECT </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  USAID joined with other donors to establish an $11.5 </p><p>million independent donor mechanism, which provides </p><p>management oversight to the operations of the GOH\'s line </p><p>ministries and independent GOH agencies in their </p><p>implementation of Hurricane Mitch reconstruction </p><p>programs.  This effort is part of a larger IDB program to </p><p>strengthen the Honduran procurement system. </p><p>Specifically, there will be selective inspections of the </p><p>procurement and contracting processes, covering </p><p>technical, administrative, financial and control aspects. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>OTHER USAID PROJECTS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>INTER-AMERICAN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  Through its Transparency Program, USAID intends to </p><p>promote monitoring of the standards set forth in the OAS </p><p>Inter-American Convention against Corruption (IACAC).  In </p><p>particular, USAID will encourage the assessment of the </p><p>Honduran legal framework against the IACAC standards. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY/PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  USAID\'s work with government control entities is </p><p>enhanced by effective public information campaigns, which </p><p>increase citizen awareness of the importance of vigilance </p><p>over the GOH\'s administration of public resources, </p><p>knowledge about what kinds of problems to look for, and </p><p>clear instructions regarding what to do if corruption is </p><p>identified.  Moreover, one of the objectives of USAID\'s </p><p>Transparency Program is to develop a public awareness </p><p>campaign strategy.  USAID published a booklet featuring </p><p>the IACAC illustrated with cartoons that relate to the </p><p>Honduran experience.  The booklet will soon be available </p><p>for distribution. </p><p> </p><p>21.  USAID and the Center for the Investigation and </p><p>Promotion of Human Rights (CIPRODEH) created a </p><p>transparency Web site (www.e-demoKratia.org), printed </p><p>bulletins called "Transluz," and presented workshops on </p><p>transparency in the budget process.  In 2001, the </p><p>Ministry of Defense published its budget for the first </p><p>time.  In 2002, the GOH published the budget broken down </p><p>by Ministry in a groundbreaking effort to achieve better </p><p>transparency.  Taken together, USAID transparency efforts </p><p>since May of 2000 have totaled $8,294,000. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>MISCELLANEOUS EFFORTS AND STRIDES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>A NEW MONEY LAUNDERING LAW </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  In February of 2002, the Congress passed new money </p><p>laundering legislation, which took effect on June 4, </p><p>2002.  The law expands the criminal definition of money </p><p>laundering to encompass any non-economically justified </p><p>sale or movement of assets, and strengthens the powers of </p><p>prosecutors to investigate and prosecute suspected </p><p>offenses.  Additionally, the new law makes the financing </p><p>of terrorism a criminal offense and provides for the </p><p>creation of a financial information unit to track </p><p>suspicious transactions. </p><p> </p><p>23.  Officials at the Attorney General\'s Office and the </p><p>National Banking Commission are drafting regulations </p><p>applicable to the new financial information unit.  In </p><p>April, the U.S. Department of Treasury sent a money </p><p>laundering expert to Honduras to conduct a needs </p><p>assessment for a USG-funded technical assistance package. </p><p>According to the Treasury expert, funding for this </p><p>project will cost about $250,000 over two (2) years. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>STOCKHOLM DECLARATION OF 1999 </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  The Stockholm Declaration of 1999 as authored by the </p><p>Mitch donors, includes as a goal: "Reconstruct and </p><p>transform Central America on the basis of an approach </p><p>integrated with Transparency and Governance."  The </p><p>Honduran Follow-Up Group on the Stockholm Principles (G- </p><p>15) was formed by the U.S., Germany, Canada, Spain, </p><p>Japan, the Netherlands, the U.K., Sweden, Italy, the IDB, </p><p>the IBRD, International Monetary Fund (IMF), UNDP, the </p><p>Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) </p><p>and the E.U.  G-15 members coordinate various efforts and </p><p>programs, and the GOH encourages donor coordination. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>GOH POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY PROGRAM </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>25.  Transparency and accountability are becoming much </p><p>more high-profile issues in Honduras.  As a result, both </p><p>transparency and accountability are included in the GOH\'s </p><p>fifteen-year Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP), </p><p>which contains guidelines to transform the country over </p><p>the next fifteen (15) years.  Notably, since Hurricane </p><p>Mitch, the GOH and civil society have taken important </p><p>steps to develop the PRSP in a participatory manner. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>A NEW GOH PROCUREMENT LAW </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26.  In September 2001, a new government procurement law </p><p>went into effect.  This new legislation in intended to </p><p>increase transparency and reduce corruption. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>A FORTHCOMING GOH CODE OF ETHICS? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>27.  The GOH is in the process of developing a code of </p><p>ethics for public employees.  Post hopes that, in fact, </p><p>an effective code of ethics will be implemented-- </p><p>including rules regarding conflicts of interest and </p><p>feasible processes for the investigation and prosecution </p><p>of such cases. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>OTHER PRIVATE SECTOR EFFORTS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>28.  There are several private sector efforts worth </p><p>mentioning: </p><p> </p><p>-The Honduran Council for Private Enterprise (COHEP) </p><p>sends a representative to the meetings of the NAC. </p><p> </p><p>-The private sector led the NAC\'s investigation on the </p><p>causes of corruption and its prevention. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>MISCELLANEOUS PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>29.  Septel (Tegucigalpa 01876) reported Ambassador Frank </p><p>Almaguer\'s June 21 speech given to the International </p><p>Development and Ethics Association (IDEA) in which he </p><p>outlined the U.S. anticorruption policies.  The speech </p><p>dominated the news in Honduras for days, and clearly has </p><p>had a significant impact.  This is the most recent of a </p><p>number of public diplomacy efforts that serve the </p><p>anticorruption effort. </p><p> </p><p>30.  There was an interactive dialogue on WHANET that </p><p>dealt with anticorruption and money laundering, in which </p><p>representatives from the MP participated. </p><p> </p><p>31.  Post arranged for an individual from the DPA to </p><p>participate in the International Visitor Program on </p><p>anticorruption in the government and private sector. </p><p> </p><p>32.  With the support of PAS, the Ambassador has become a </p><p>champion of Honduran anticorruption efforts.  This is the </p><p>result of a multitude of public diplomacy efforts, </p><p>including: </p><p> </p><p>-Post regularly distributes USG policy statements on </p><p>anticorruption to the Honduran press--for example, A/S </p><p>Reich\'s speech on Latin American policy and </p><p>anticorruption efforts. </p><p> </p><p>-The Ambassador frequently publicly addresses various </p><p>anticorruption issues (e.g. money laundering, judicial </p><p>reform, transparency in governance) by way of speeches at </p><p>various events, press releases, radio and television </p><p>interviews and other media.  As a result, anticorruption </p><p>has become a popular topic for public debate and public </p><p>awareness has been significantly heightened. </p><p> </p><p>-Post has worked hard to convey the message that </p><p>anticorruption efforts are an important component of the </p><p>war on terrorism--that money laundering, arms and </p><p>narcotics trafficking and government corruption all </p><p>create an environment in which terrorism can thrive. </p><p> </p><p>ALMAGUER </p><p></p></div>
