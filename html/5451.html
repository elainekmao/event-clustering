<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000673 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>G/IWI FOR APRIL PALMERLEE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: THE VIEW OF A POTENTIAL FEMALE CANDIDATE FOR </p><p>PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 03620 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  On January 21, PolOff met with Nadia Alool, </p><p>a long-time human rights contact who is contemplating a bid </p><p>for a parliamentary seat in the forthcoming elections </p><p>scheduled for this summer.  Alool attended Post\'s political </p><p>campaign workshop in January.  She "is about 65 percent </p><p>certain" she will run in the candidate-heavy third district, </p><p>and plans to campaign on an agenda of educational reform, </p><p>providing services for the district\'s constituents and her </p><p>ability, as a woman, to represent Jordan to "the outside </p><p>world."  Alool discussed the challenges for women in the </p><p>upcoming elections, and echoed the popular prediction that </p><p>the Muslim Brotherhood will likely be able to field a large </p><p>number of "electable" female candidates.  Notwithstanding, </p><p>she is up for the challenge.  "Let\'s face it: Nothing like </p><p>this comes easy."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Nadia Alool is a long-time human rights and public </p><p>affairs contact.  In 1999, she visited the U.S. on Post\'s </p><p>"Women and the Enhancement of Democratic Values" program.  In </p><p>early January, she attended a three-day workshop run by </p><p>Post\'s PD Section, "How to Run a Political Campaign", </p><p>designed for female candidates.  Alool has been involved with </p><p>various human rights activities for years and is on the </p><p>executive committee for the National Society for Enhancement </p><p>of Democracy.  She frequently travels to Europe for human </p><p>rights conferences (usually focusing on women\'s issues).  In </p><p>addition, Alool writes regularly for the Arabic daily "al </p><p>Ra-i".  Alool is charismatic, confident and has the family </p><p>financial backing to successfully campaign for a </p><p>parliamentary seat here. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>"SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT </p><p>CERTAIN I WILL RUN" </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  On January 21, PolOff met with Alool at her family\'s </p><p>concrete company office.  She was thankful for the recent </p><p>workshop, although she noted that more than a few men also </p><p>could have benefited from the workshop.  Alool said that, </p><p>generally, she is against the idea of a quota for women, but </p><p>agrees with the idea of having one for two terms.  "For now, </p><p>the reality for female candidates is that the door is ajar, </p><p>but not fully open.  We need a little boost." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Alool is "sixty-five percent certain" she will run, </p><p>noting that she will have to put up approximately 30,000 JD </p><p>to run for a seat in Amman\'s third district, which will be </p><p>heavily contested with a field likely to include several </p><p>candidates, both women and men (the district stretches from </p><p>working-class downtown to wealthy West Amman).  Alool\'s </p><p>campaign strategy is not complete, and will depend on whether </p><p>the quota framework reserving seats for women (septel) will </p><p>allow her to run from the third district or require her to </p><p>run for an "at-large" seat.  She says she will campaign on </p><p>raising general awareness of the need for better education </p><p>and providing better government services.  She also stressed </p><p>the need for Jordanians to think critically about matters </p><p>that are affecting their daily lives.  "For example, we need </p><p>to ask men why they are keeping their women from working </p><p>while their children are hungry.  Why don\'t they allow their </p><p>women to work if they are poor?  We need to think about </p><p>this." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  On Iraq and the West Bank, Alool says it is time to </p><p>search for peaceful solutions.  "We tried war here (in the </p><p>region), now let\'s try peace."  Interest in the plight of the </p><p>Iraqi people aside, Alool does not believe Jordanians will </p><p>take to the street in overwhelming masses or exhibit their </p><p>frustrations toward U.S. policy with drastic measures. </p><p>"People just want it to be quick and over with soon," she </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>UNCERTAIN ELECTION RULES, CERTAIN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Alool is waiting to see how the eight seats reserved </p><p>for women will be allocated, i.e. whether the top female </p><p>vote-getters will win, or whether there will some sort of </p><p>districting.  In any case, Alool noted that any woman elected </p><p>to parliament will have to face the international media. </p><p>"We\'ll be speaking, and acting, in front of an international </p><p>audience, since we\'ll be making history here."  Alool is </p><p>confident that this will help her, as she speaks several </p><p>languages and is comfortable in front of international </p><p>audiences. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>FINDING A CONSTITUENCY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Despite Alool\'s confidence in herself, she believes </p><p>(along with many other contacts) that it will be difficult to </p><p>enlist women to vote for a female candidate.  She said that </p><p>men often tell their wives for whom they must vote, and a lot </p><p>of women don\'t have an independent knowledge of issues or </p><p>candidates yet.  As for men, it will be hard to convince them </p><p>that a woman can deliver services and otherwise represent the </p><p>district in a traditionally patriarchal, tribal system. </p><p>Efficient women can compete with or without a quota, she </p><p>said, but the problem is finding a constituency or a district </p><p>where a woman can convince people to vote for her.  Note: </p><p>Alool wasn\'t sure if Toujan Faisal would be able to run again </p><p>in light of her conviction (reftel), but was fairly certain </p><p>that Faisal would try, would indeed have a strong following, </p><p>and would likely run in the third district.  Other contacts </p><p>share this view.  End note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT.  We believe that Alool is representative of </p><p>a small but growing group of educated and worldly women brave </p><p>enough to take a chance at a parliamentary campaign who also </p><p>enjoy familial and financial support.  In the face of the </p><p>well-organized opposition parties here, it will likely be </p><p>tough going for these women.  The popular prediction (also </p><p>held by Alool) is that the Islamic Action Front, if it </p><p>participates, will win most of the seats reserved for women </p><p>with a slew of "electable" female candidates.  Still, Alool </p><p>believes that her candidacy is probably worth a shot.  "Let\'s </p><p>face it: Nothing like this comes easy," she said.  We will </p><p>report in depth on the quota for women septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
