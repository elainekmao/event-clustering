Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Expectations in Sri Lanka are running </p><p>high for the November 25 Oslo conference.  Observers see </p><p>the conference as a chance for the international </p><p>community to send a strong signal of support for the </p><p>peace effort.  Amid this focus on a political message, </p><p>expectations have been lowered that the conference is </p><p>going to rake in big pledges for Sri Lanka.  Slicing </p><p>against the grain, a small, vocal minority is fiercely </p><p>critical of the conference, seeing it as a boon for the </p><p>LTTE.  After years of brutal war, the conference is a </p><p>vital moment for Sri Lanka as it tries to re-enter the </p><p>international mainstream.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Seeking a Political Signal </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The "Sri Lanka Peace Process Support Meeting" </p><p>scheduled for November 25 in Oslo is garnering lots of </p><p>buzz in Sri Lanka.  Most Sri Lankans have high </p><p>expectations for the conference.  Taking a cue from the </p><p>GSL (see below), observers primarily see the conference </p><p>as a chance for the international community to send a </p><p>strong political signal of support for the GSL- </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) peace effort. </p><p>In various recent conversations, Mission has picked up </p><p>the following perspectives: </p><p> </p><p>-- Kedish Loganathan of the Center for Policy </p><p>Alternatives, a well-known local think-tank, told us </p><p>that the conference placed a bright spotlight on Sri </p><p>Lanka and its problems.  Sri Lankans want a "political </p><p>signal" to emerge from the conference highlighting </p><p>international support for the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>-- Gajan Ponnambalam, a Tamil National Alliance (TNA) </p><p>MP, told us that it was "a very good development to see </p><p>the GSL and the LTTE sitting down together with the </p><p>international community.  It reflects how seriously the </p><p>international community views the peace process and also </p><p>the sincerity of its commitment to helping Sri Lanka." </p><p> </p><p>-- Godfrey Gunatilleke, the Director of the Marga </p><p>Institute, a think-tank, remarked:  "The Oslo </p><p>international forum focused on peace is very welcome. </p><p>Looking for support from the international community is </p><p>a positive step and will help set the peace process in </p><p>concrete." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Less Focus on Pledging </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Amid the focus on a political message, </p><p>expectations have been lowered that the conference is </p><p>going to rake in big pledges for Sri Lanka.  Initially, </p><p>the government had tried to sell the conference mainly </p><p>as a way for the country to pick up funding support for </p><p>humanitarian/reconstruction projects.  In fact, against </p><p>the backdrop of complaints that the GSL was not focusing </p><p>enough on bread-and-butter issues, the government had </p><p>seemed to indicate that the conference was a way for Sri </p><p>Lanka to help revive its economy.  Perhaps because a </p><p>follow-on conference is scheduled to take place next </p><p>year in Japan with pledging as the main focus in any </p><p>case, the government is now lowballing the possibility </p><p>of large sums being raised at Oslo.  G.L. Peiris, a </p><p>senior minister involved in peace process issues, made </p><p>this point in remarks at a press conference the other </p><p>day, stating: </p><p> </p><p>"We are not hoping for astronomical sums of money.  What </p><p>is important is not the magnitude of resources -- the </p><p>absorptive capacity is limited.  What we expect most out </p><p>of the Oslo conference is a very strong, unequivocal </p><p>message of support and solidarity for the peace </p><p>process." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) (((Note:  In line with the apparent shift in </p><p>emphasis from pledging to a more politically-focused </p><p>message, there has been a corresponding shift in the way </p><p>the Oslo conference is referred to:  it had been called </p><p>a "donors\' conference," but now is formally entitled </p><p>"Sri Lanka Peace Process Support Meeting."))) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Small Band of Critics </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Slicing against the grain, a small, vocal </p><p>minority is fiercely critical of the conference, seeing </p><p>it as wrong for the LTTE to be present.  This view was </p><p>exemplified in an editorial in "The Island," an English- </p><p>language paper, on November 21.  This editorial -- which </p><p>was placed on the front-page, a rare occurrence -- </p><p>essentially echoed themes from previous "Island" </p><p>editorials (see Ref B), but in harsher tones.  The main </p><p>point was that the international community was way out </p><p>of line in allowing the LTTE, a terrorist organization, </p><p>to participate in Oslo.  The U.S. was specifically </p><p>signaled out for censure.  Choicer bits of the editorial </p><p>included: </p><p> </p><p>-- "The most saddening development of all will be that </p><p>the mighty democracies of the world, the stout defenders </p><p>of human rights, are likely to sit down for talks with </p><p>(the LTTE), despite they themselves having specifically </p><p>declared the LTTE a terrorist organization." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The LTTE falls well into the category of </p><p>international terrorist organizations specified by UN </p><p>resolutions, in addition to being proscribed in the </p><p>U.S., Canada, Australia, Britain, and India.  Can they </p><p>disregard their own anti-terrorist laws and UN anti- </p><p>terrorist resolutions in such a cavalier manner because </p><p>it suits their objectives?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Anti-terrorist laws clearly spell out there can be </p><p>no negotiations, direct or indirect, with terrorist </p><p>organizations.  In law, those nations (participating in </p><p>Oslo) can only talk to the Sri Lankan government." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) This type of criticism does not seem to be </p><p>reverberating on the streets.  As far as Mission is </p><p>aware, there have been no demonstrations against the </p><p>Oslo conference.  Representatives of President </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s party, the People\'s Alliance (PA), and the </p><p>radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), have hit out </p><p>at the Oslo conference in various speeches, however. </p><p>The PA even went so far as to issue a long public </p><p>statement late last week criticizing the GSL\'s handling </p><p>of the peace process and Norway\'s facilitation effort. </p><p>The statement also raised some questions about the </p><p>LTTE\'s participation in the conference -- See Ref B. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) After years of brutal war, the conference is a </p><p>big moment for Sri Lanka as it tries to re-enter the </p><p>international mainstream.  The fact that key states -- </p><p>most especially the U.S. -- are sitting down to </p><p>underscore support for Sri Lanka and its peace process </p><p>is considered very important here.  We expect that the </p><p>conference will receive significant press coverage and </p><p>be a feather in the government\'s cap.  There will </p><p>continue to be some dissonance from some quarters on the </p><p>issue of the LTTE\'s participation, but the conference </p><p>should accomplish its key purpose, i.e., strengthening </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s peace process.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
