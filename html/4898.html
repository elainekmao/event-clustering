(SBU) Summary.  AES Honduras signed a contract on </p><p>December 27 with the state-owned electricity company ENEE to </p><p>provide 200 MW of electricity starting within three years. </p><p>The deal came after the ENEE Board of Directors annulled the </p><p>tender award to Lufussa on December 19.  In an emergency </p><p>meeting on December 20, the Council of Ministers authorized </p><p>the ENEE to sign direct purchase agreements for a total of </p><p>410 MW with the companies who made the best offers based on </p><p>price and quality.  Lufussa also reportedly signed a 210 MW </p><p>contract earlier in the week.  Embassy wished to thank </p><p>Washington agencies for their strong support during this </p><p>hard-fought advocacy effort.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) AES\' local representative reported that on December </p><p>27 AES Honduras signed a deal with the state-owned </p><p>electricity company ENEE for 200 MW.  AES chose to begin </p><p>providing electricity within 36 months, allowing it to </p><p>operate the plant with natural gas from the beginning.  The </p><p>ENEE refused to consider standard clauses used in </p><p>international financing with multilaterals like the </p><p>International Finance Corporation or the Interamerican </p><p>Development Bank.  The local AES representative reported </p><p>that despite the omission of the standard clauses, the </p><p>contract provides enough flexibility to complete the USD 600 </p><p>million investment.  Honduran energy company Lufussa also </p><p>signed a contract for 210 MW with 24 months COD earlier in </p><p>the week.  We understand that the contracts would go to the </p><p>National Congress for approval on January 27. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The deals came after the Council of Ministers held </p><p>an emergency meeting on December 20, a day after the ENEE </p><p>Board of Directors unanimously agreed to annul the public </p><p>tender for the 210 MW electricity contract, to discuss what </p><p>to do about the bid.  The ENEE Board annulled the bid over </p><p>concerns that the legal challenges to the decision to award </p><p>the 210 MW contract to Lufussa would tie up the bid contract </p><p>in the courts for years, impede the creation of new capacity </p><p>and ultimately lead to a potential national energy crisis in </p><p>2004 (ref\'s e & f).  The government has not acknowledged any </p><p>flaws in the tender process. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Following the meeting, the Council of Ministers sent </p><p>instructions to the ENEE to arrange direct contracts for the </p><p>original 210 MW contemplated in the bid and an additional </p><p>200 MW for demand growth.  Minister of the Presidency Luis </p><p>Cosenza announced to the press that the contracts would be </p><p>signed with the bidders who made the best offers, based on </p><p>quality and price, in the original public tender. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Embassy would like to thank Washington agencies for </p><p>their support throughout.  Advocacy by then Assistant </p><p>Secretary of WHA Otto Reich, Commerce Secretary Donald Evans </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>and Under Secretary for Economic Affairs Alan Larson, all </p><p>expressing their interest in a fair and transparent bid </p><p>process, were especially helpful. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
