<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 005417 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/FO, NEA/NGA, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EINV, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) KUWAITI INTERESTS IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) RIYADH 8176 </p><p>     B. B) KUWAIT 3081 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The GOK, increasingly confident that the US </p><p>is determined to eliminate Saddam Hussein\'s regime, is more </p><p>and more willing to let its public support show, even as it </p><p>maintains its formal commitment to Arab League and GCC </p><p>opposition to any pre-emptive strike on Iraq.  Prominent </p><p>Kuwaiti merchant families see vast potential for investment </p><p>and trade with a post-Saddam Iraq; given the unfavorable </p><p>investment climate at home, they have a lot of liquidity to </p><p>draw on.  Some still have family ties to southern Iraq and </p><p>have been quietly sending financial aid to their kin via </p><p>Jordan.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) LETTING IT SHOW:  The GOK, increasingly confident </p><p>that the US is determined to eliminate Saddam Hussein\'s </p><p>regime, is more and more willing to let its support show </p><p>publicly, even as it maintains its formal commitment to Arab </p><p>League and GCC opposition to any strike on Iraq.  In recent </p><p>weeks, the GOK openly hosted two prominent Iraqi opposition </p><p>figures:  first Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim, head of the Shiite </p><p>Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), </p><p>then Jalal Talabani, head of the Kurdish Patriotic Union of </p><p>Kurdistan (PUK).  Both held meetings with senior </p><p>ruling-family members including the First Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister and Foreign Minister, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber </p><p>al-Sabah, who is de facto ruler given the debility of the </p><p>Amir and Crown Prince/Prime Minister.  The GOK also announced </p><p>plans to send observers to the Iraqi opposition conference in </p><p>London this week.  (Question for Embassy London:  were GOK </p><p>reps evident?)  This trend was accelerated by Saddam\'s </p><p>December 7 address to "the people in Kuwait," which sparked </p><p>widespread outrage here (septel).  Supposedly an apology, it </p><p>was in fact filled with insults, threats and incitement to </p><p>violence. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE VISION THING:  Kuwait, following the Saudi line </p><p>(ref A), will want post-Saddam Iraq to remain a unified </p><p>country under Arab leadership, preferably Sunni -- although </p><p>the GOK is less dogmatic on that point than the SAG.  We </p><p>assess that Kuwait will want to be seen as contributing </p><p>substantively to the reconstruction of Iraq, if only to </p><p>deflect blame for the years of suffering its neighbor has </p><p>endured.  The GOK already knows it will face intense pressure </p><p>to forgive much of Iraq\'s debt, particularly the UN-endorsed </p><p>compensation for Iraq\'s depredations during the 1990-91 </p><p>occupation; it will try to avoid opening itself to charges of </p><p>seeking to keep the Iraqi people down after the Baath regime </p><p>is gone. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Some Kuwaitis worry that their country\'s value to the </p><p>US will decline precipitously after regime-change in Iraq, </p><p>especially if the USG devotes a huge investment to developing </p><p>a \'new Iraq\' as a model for the region.  This, however, does </p><p>not begin to rival their desire for an end to the existential </p><p>menace of Saddam -- more than anything else, the Kuwaitis </p><p>want us to succeed quickly, with minimal loss of civilian </p><p>lives and property.  Kuwaitis are probably less worried than </p><p>most Arabs about facing US-inspired pressure for </p><p>democratization, given their established tradition of a </p><p>rambunctious democratically-elected parliament.  They also </p><p>understand the point that a true democracy is built on strong </p><p>institutions that protect minority rights through the rule of </p><p>law. </p><p> </p><p>TRADE AND INVESTMENT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>5.  (C) Conversations with Kuwaiti business leaders reveal </p><p>palpable anticipation of trade and investment opportunities </p><p>in a post-Saddam Iraq.  Kuwaiti merchants and </p><p>service-providers are well placed to export supplies and </p><p>equipment to Iraq, because of Kuwait\'s proximity to Basra, </p><p>its developed infrastructure, and the family ties that still </p><p>bind some entrepreneurs to southern Iraq despite the strains </p><p>brought on by the Iraqi occupation and the subsequent </p><p>sanctions:  some merchant families have quietly been sending </p><p>financial aid to their kin in Iraq via Jordan.  Some </p><p>entertain hopes of successfully asserting title to family </p><p>property in southern Iraq.  At one time, our sources tell us, </p><p>Kuwaitis owned some 38 million date-palms around Basra.  They </p><p>all were lost during the Iran-Iraq war but Kuwaitis know the </p><p>land could bear fruit again some day. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Kuwaiti investors have a great deal of liquidity </p><p>resulting from higher-than-budgeted oil prices, UN </p><p>Compensation Commission payments, and an unfavorable </p><p>investment climate at home (ref B) and depressed equity </p><p>markets worldwide.  An Iraq freed of the Baath regime looks </p><p>attractive to them due to its wealth of natural resources </p><p>(oil, water, fertile land), its educated workforce, and its </p><p>familiarity based on proximity and the two countries\' shared </p><p>Arab and Muslim heritage.  One entrepreneur envisages </p><p>building a new port near the border to handle some of the </p><p>anticipated trade, given the crumbling state of many existing </p><p>Iraqi facilities. Another expects to make a significant </p><p>fortune selling paint and milk across the border.  We hear </p><p>vague but credible reports of retailers stocking up on food </p><p>and other consumer items, ready to supply Iraq with products </p><p>it wants and needs. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  The Kuwaitis are depending on us to prevail </p><p>against Saddam, and to protect them in the process.  The more </p><p>we look like winners and liberators, the more secure their </p><p>own position becomes.  The Kuwaitis\' worst nightmare is a US </p><p>climb-down that would leave Saddam in power.  Next worst </p><p>would be a protracted, bloody conflict that inflamed the </p><p>passions of the wider Arab and Muslim worlds, even if we </p><p>ultimately prevailed. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
