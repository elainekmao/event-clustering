<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000498 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, ASEC, CASC, SOCI, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIONAL PARK CLOSED TO ALL BUT TOURISTS </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Deteriorating security conditions have </p><p>all but closed Royal Bardiya National Park in western </p><p>Nepal to researchers and conservationists and have </p><p>disrupted some development projects.  Tourists still have </p><p>access to the park, but the local economy has taken a deep </p><p>hit from the drastic drop-off in tourist arrivals. </p><p>Nepal\'s army pulled back from a highway checkpoint and a </p><p>sub-post; as a result, poaching, smuggling and Maoist- </p><p>related movements have increased.  Villagers fear both the </p><p>Maoists and agents of the state, and complain that a long- </p><p>standing lack of resources has been exacerbated by the </p><p>worsening security climate.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Park Closed to Researchers and Conservationists </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Due to security restrictions, research and </p><p>conservation activities have come almost to a standstill </p><p>inside Royal Bardiya National Park in western Nepal, and </p><p>have been "severely curtailed" in the surrounding "buffer </p><p>zones."  Community development activities also been </p><p>affected, and have been suspended in some areas.  The </p><p>security situation in the area around the park </p><p>deteriorated by the day, according to a conservationist </p><p>stationed there. </p><p> </p><p>Few Intrepid Tourists </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Tourists were still permitted to enter the park </p><p>with a guide, but few made the effort.  Hotels have cut </p><p>back on staff - the most popular guest house for foreign </p><p>budget travelers now operates with a skeleton crew - or </p><p>closed altogether.  Locals told Poloff that the fall-off </p><p>in tourism has had an impact not just on wage earners in </p><p>the tourism sector, but also on agricultural workers who </p><p>used to sell produce to hotels and restaurants. </p><p> </p><p>Army Dug In, But Pulling Back </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) At one of the points where the East-West highway </p><p>crosses park lands, an army checkpoint was attacked by </p><p>Maoists on February 24.  No one was injured.  [Note: </p><p>Press reports have not mentioned this incident, but RNA </p><p>officials in Bardiya confirmed it to Post.]  The </p><p>checkpoint, which was used to enforce the 40 kph speed </p><p>limit through the park, was subsequently abandoned and had </p><p>not been reopened.  As a result, motorists could be seen </p><p>moving well in excess of the speed limit, presenting a </p><p>danger to the park\'s endangered animals, which include </p><p>tiger, rhino and bear.  Due to resource constraints, the </p><p>army has also shut down a sub-post on the south side of </p><p>the park.  Conservation officials say that this has led to </p><p>the growth of illegal timber cutting and poaching, as well </p><p>as an increase in Maoist activity in the area. </p><p> </p><p>Harvest of Wild Grasses Affected </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) For security reasons, and because it is now </p><p>stretched thin, the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) decided to </p><p>prohibit local residents from entering the park to harvest </p><p>wild grass this year.  In the past, villagers have been </p><p>permitted into the park during the dry season to cut the </p><p>grass, which they use both for feed and as construction </p><p>material.  The grass becomes unmanageable if not cut. </p><p>This year army personnel had to burn some of it.  The burn </p><p>imposed a hardship on the army, which had to dedicate </p><p>resources to the operation; on the government, which </p><p>missed out on revenue earned from grass-cutting fees; and </p><p>on the villagers, who have to do without the grass. </p><p> </p><p>Resource-Starved Villagers Fear Both Sides </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Villagers living around the national park </p><p>expressed fear of both the Maoists and the government. </p><p>Poverty remained endemic, and most girls have acquired </p><p>only the most basic informal education.  One ethnic Tharu </p><p>who teaches at a public school near the park reported that </p><p>his work was difficult because the government lacked the </p><p>funds to hire new teachers even though every year more and </p><p>more students enrolled.  The pupils\' parents also lacked </p><p>the funds to support their children\'s studies.  The </p><p>teacher reported - and other residents confirmed - that </p><p>political problems had not flared up in the school </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Community development programs that formerly </p><p>benefited many villagers in Bardiya are now on hold and </p><p>will not resume without improvements in the security </p><p>situation.  Until then, further economic and social </p><p>development will be difficult at best.  Moreover, the RNA </p><p>pull-back - for want of the means to fight the insurgency </p><p>- has jeopardized the park\'s wildlife and other resources, </p><p>and has opened up the possibility for the Maoists to </p><p>exploit them. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
