<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001318 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MNUC, KSCA, ETTC, TSPA, YM, MTCRE, DEMARCHE </p><p>SUBJECT: ICOC - URGING ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES TO SUBSCRIBE: </p><p>YEMEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.STATE 97985 B.STATE 155178 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE ALAN MISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5(B) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On 6/7, Acting Pol/Econ Chief delivered Ref A demarche </p><p>concerning the International Code of Conduct against </p><p>Ballistic Missile Proliferation (ICOC) to Marwan Noman, </p><p>Office Director to Yemen\'s Foreign Minister. </p><p> </p><p> 2.  (C) Noman was familiar with the issue: the diplomatic </p><p>note that would have added Yemen to the list of ICOC </p><p>signatories had been on his desk in April, ready to pass to </p><p>Foreign Minister Abu-Baker al-Qirbi for signature.  According </p><p>to Noman, the Ministry of Defense objected at the last </p><p>minute, claiming the Code would limit their military options. </p><p> That objection had trumped, at least for the time being, the </p><p>strong ICOC endorsement given by Amat al-Alim al-Soswah, </p><p>recently named as Minister of Human Rights in the new Yemeni </p><p>cabinet. </p><p> </p><p> 3. (C) Pol/Econ chief reviewed ref B talking points, </p><p>stressing that the ICOC would not affect any legitimate </p><p>defense or space exploration requirements.  Noman promised to </p><p>raise the matter again and said he was optimistic that the </p><p>MOD objections would be overcome and the Foreign Minister </p><p>would sign the ICOC. </p><p> </p><p>4. (c) Comment: The view presented to us --  that FM Qirbi </p><p>and the MFA are ready to proceed, while the MOD is hesitant </p><p>-- is credible.  Our MFA contacts say MOD reservations are </p><p>not deeply held and may soon give way.  Nevertheless, such </p><p>inter-ministerial discord often proves difficult for the ROYG </p><p>to resolve.  Post will continue to press on both the MFA and </p><p>the MOD. </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
