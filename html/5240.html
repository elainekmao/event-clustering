Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On January 21, Turkish Treasury auctioned a one-year </p><p>fixed rate bond and a two-year floating rate bond today to </p><p>strong demand, in advance of a January 22 debt redemption to </p><p>the market of TL 5.4 quadrillion (about $3.5 billion). </p><p>Treasury sold: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- a total of TL 3.2 quadrillion of the one-year bond </p><p>(including about TL 2.7 quad or $1.65 billion to the market) </p><p>at a 58.5 percent compounded yield; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- a total of TL 0.33 quadrillion of the two-year, floating </p><p>rate bond (including TL 275 trillion or $165 million to the </p><p>market). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.

(SBU) Comment:  After today\'s auction results, Turkish </p><p>market participants are breathing a sigh of relief, but not </p><p>expecting a market rally.

(SBU) Relations with the IMF remain on hold, pending GOT </p><p>delivery of the LOI and adoption of the fiscal measures </p><p>suggested by IMF staff.   The GOT received and understood IMF </p><p>Deputy MD Anne Krueger\'s tough message on economic reforms, </p><p>according to Dogan Holding CEO Darbaz, who briefed us </p><p>following a round of meetings in Ankara January 22 (Darbaz </p><p>said State Minister Babacan delivered this message to AK </p><p>Chairman Erdogan).  IMF resrep told us he expects to receive </p><p>the LOI this week. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
