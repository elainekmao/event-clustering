<p>UNCLAS KHARTOUM 13366 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, PINS, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  SUDANESE HEAD OF STATE ENDORSES SHARIA LAW </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) KHARTOUM 11067, B) KHARTOUM 11182, </p><p>      C) KHARTOUM 11159 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  ACCORDING TO SUDAN\'S ENGLISH LANGUAGE WEEKLY "NEW </p><p>HORIZON," SUDAN\'S HEAD OF STATE, GENERAL OMAR AL BASHIR, </p><p>HAS PUBLICLY ENDORSED THE 1983 SEPTEMBER LAWS.  PROVIDING </p><p>FOR CORPORAL PUNISHMENT KNOWN AS "HUDUD," THE SEPTEMBER </p><p>LAWS ARE ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF </p><p>SUDANESE SOCIETY AND JURISPRUDENCE.  ALTHOUGH PRECEDING </p><p>THE SEPTEMBER LAWS, JOHN GARANG\'S REBELLION IN MARCH 1983 </p><p>CAME IN PART AS A RESULT OF THEN PRESIDENT NIMEIRI\'S </p><p>TREND TOWARD ISLAMICIZATION.  HUDUD PUNISHMENTS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>HANDED DOWN, HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED SINCE NIMEIRI\'S </p><p>OVERTHROW IN 1985, AND THE ROLE OF SHARIA REMAINS A MAJOR </p><p>SYMBOL IN THE CONTINUING CIVIL WAR. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENT:  BASHIR\'S ENDORSEMENT OF THE SEPTEMBER LAWS </p><p>COULD LEAD TO IMPLEMENTATION OF HUDUD PUNISHMENTS.  IT </p><p>WILL CERTAINLY LEAD TO A FURTHER ESTRANGEMENT FROM THE </p><p>SOUTH (IF THAT IS POSSIBLE).  IN ADDITION, BASHIR\'S </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT COULD LEAD TO DIFFICULTIES IN SUDAN\'S UNITY </p><p>PLANS WITH LIBYA.  DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO KHARTOUM </p><p>QADHAFI WAS VERY CRITICAL OF SHARIA AND ALLEGEDLY </p><p>INTIMIDATED BASHIR INTO NOT ENDORSING SHARIA AT THAT TIME </p><p>(REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>O\'NEILL </p><p></p></div>
