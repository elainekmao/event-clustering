Ankara is </p><p>ready to supply medical equipment, reconstruct the Iraqi </p><p>telecommunications system, and reform the banking sector. </p><p>Amb. Ziyal has told the U.S. that Turkey is ready to spend </p><p>part of the U.S.-provided $8.5 billion loan for the </p><p>restructuring of Iraq.  Turkey has also voiced its readiness </p><p>to contribute to the international peacekeeping force in </p><p>Iraq.  The package also envisages that Incirlik airbase </p><p>could be turned into a logistical support center for Iraq. </p><p>Dailies believe that Ziyal has assured the U.S. of Turkey\'s </p><p>backing for the U.S. position against Iran. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MFA persuades TGS against Iranian army chief visit: A TGS </p><p>attempt to invite Iran\'s commander of regular troops to </p><p>Turkey was halted by the MFA, which told the military that </p><p>the U.S. might be offended by military exchanges between </p><p>Ankara and Tehran, according to "Milliyet."  The paper </p><p>quotes unidentified sources as saying that the Turkish </p><p>military would have triggered a controversy by hosting </p><p>Iranian commanders at a critical time when allegations are </p><p>being made by the U.S. and EU against Iran for developing </p><p>nuclear weapons.  Following the warning, the TGS has decided </p><p>to postpone meetings with Iranian army officials.  The paper </p><p>regards the attempt as a response by the TGS to Wolfowitz </p><p>and other American `hawks\' who blame the military in Turkey </p><p>for rejection of the March 1 decree that would have allowed </p><p>foreign troops to be deployed on Turkish soil against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas Weston said </p><p>after meeting with the Turkish and Greek leaders on the </p><p>island earlier this week that the Greeks were ready to </p><p>negotiate the Annan plan while Denktas maintains his rigid </p><p>stance.  Weston stressed that a settlement is expected </p><p>before the Greek Cypriots\' EU membership begins in 2004.  EU </p><p>expansion chief Verheugen said on Tuesday that Ankara and </p><p>Denktas should grab the opportunity provided by the Annan </p><p>plan since, he noted, the Greek side would definitely join </p><p>the EU next year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Galbraith suggests `loose federation\' for Iraq: The former </p><p>U.S. envoy to post-war Croatia, Peter Galbraith, told the </p><p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee that a loose federation </p><p>based on the Canadian or Bosnian model is most appropriate </p><p>for Iraq.  Kurds have been the most reliable regional ally </p><p>for the U.S., Galbraith noted, adding that the U.S. should </p><p>not worry much about a possible `peaceful divorce\' between </p><p>the Kurds and Iraq in ten years time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President approves critical UN accords: President Sezer has </p><p>approved two UN agreements on civil, political, economic and </p><p>cultural rights in advance of the EU summit in Thessaloniki </p><p>this weekend.  The agreements, signed byTurkey in August </p><p>2000, include the right of minorities to `self- </p><p>determination\' use of their mother tongue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU wants election threshold lowered: "Hurriyet" claims that </p><p>the EU has asked   Ankara, through various channels, to </p><p>lower the 10 percent threshold applied in general elections </p><p>in Turkey.  The EU believes that the election threshold was </p><p>mainly implemented to keep pro-Kurdish DEHAP from winning </p><p>parliamentary seats.  "Hurriyet" expects the new EU demand </p><p>to put considerable pressure on the AKP, which might lose </p><p>its comfortable majority in parliament by such a move. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iran </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The truth about Iran" </p><p>Cengiz Candar opined in the conservative DB Tercuman (6/18): </p><p>"Arguing about whether or not `it\'s now Iran\'s turn\' only </p><p>serves the interests of conspiracy-theorists.  The fact of </p><p>the matter is that the US wants to see a regime change in </p><p>Iran as quickly as possible, and will intensify its efforts </p><p>toward this goal.  However, this goal is not leading to a </p><p>military operation.  There is no need for that.  It seems </p><p>that the internal dynamics of Iran are strong and vivid </p><p>enough to make this change without the need for external </p><p>intervention. . The truth about Iran stands as an historic </p><p>proof of the collapse of political Islam." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iranians are just fed up" </p><p>Zafer Atay observed in the economic-political Dunya (6/18): </p><p>"The street protests in Iran, although minor in number, are </p><p>very much typical of totalitarian regimes, such as the </p><p>former Ceauscescu regime in Bucharest. . The US is doing its </p><p>best to use Iranian anti-regime leaders.  However, the real </p><p>energy stems from the people of Iran, who are fed up with </p><p>the current system. . The US will not start a military </p><p>operation at this stage against Iran as long as Iran does </p><p>its homework.  The initial signs, however, are not </p><p>promising.  Iran has declined to accept a team of inspectors </p><p>from the IAEA. . Washington has already declared to the </p><p>world that Iran has a `secret\' nuclear weapons program. </p><p>More importantly, the EU is on the US side this time.  It </p><p>remains to be seen whether the Mullahs will take the proper </p><p>lesson from this though, judging from past experience, it </p><p>seems unlikely." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
