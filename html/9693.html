<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001906 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, PHUM, KDEM, PINR, PINS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON VIOLENT POLITICAL PROTESTS IN GUATEMALA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 1904 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1900 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/PolCouns Robert E. Copley for reason 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) At 2:00 PM local time on July 25, the disturbances </p><p>seem to be winding down.  In a second day of protests, </p><p>pro-Rios Montt demonstrators focused their morning activities </p><p>around the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, and Supreme </p><p>Electoral Tribunal buildings--all related to Rios Montt\'s </p><p>efforts to register his Presidential candidacy.  Riot police </p><p>and combined police/military patrols were seen moving in the </p><p>area, but took no action.  Four journalists were beaten by </p><p>demonstrators, who also destroyed their cameras and other </p><p>equipment. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Rumors circulated that the demonstrators were being </p><p>relieved by fresh replacements in a synchronized fashion and </p><p>seemed to be confirmed by reliable reports that some 80 </p><p>bus-loads of protesters were bound for the capital.  By 12:30 </p><p>PM, new rumors circulated that Rios Montt had released a tape </p><p>recording asking the demonstrators to cease action and go </p><p>home.  Journalist broadcast images of protesters boarding </p><p>buses near the Constitutional court and by 1:30 PM, the area </p><p>was nearly deserted.  The inbound buses have not appeared. </p><p>We continue to monitor the situation. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A haggard Minister of Interior admitted to the </p><p>Ambassador and RSO that police had not always carried out his </p><p>orders and that the FRG\'s purpose was sheer intimidation. </p><p>Minister Calderon agreed that heads should roll within the </p><p>police once the immediate situation is contained.  Calderon </p><p>was ambivalent at best about the President\'s July 24 order </p><p>for joint police/military forces to restore order, pointing </p><p>out that the Minster of Defense is outside the country and </p><p>arguing that the Chief of Staff (son of Rios Montt) was not </p><p>providing much assistance. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Legal questions about Rios Montt\'s ability to campaign </p><p>may not be resolved soon.  The President of the Supreme </p><p>Court, Carlos Larios Ochaita, announced in a noon press </p><p>conference that the Court was closing because of the protests </p><p>and had evacuated its personnel due to complete lack of </p><p>security.  Ochaita called the response to bomb threats and </p><p>the level of police protection outside his building </p><p>"completely inadequate." </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
