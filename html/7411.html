NIACT immediate precedence required for action outside </p><p>normal working hours. </p><p> </p><p>2.   This is an action message. </p><p> </p><p>2.  US academic and military contacts indicate they are </p><p>hearing rumors that antiquities looted from the Baghdad </p><p>Iraqi Museum are already appearing on European markets. </p><p>Press reports that looters also destroyed records of museum </p><p>holdings suggest that there was an intention to move and </p><p>sell the most valuable items outside Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3. Stopping the loss of these priceless objects will take a </p><p>fast and concerted multi-agency and international effort. </p><p>We suggest the following immediate steps. </p><p> </p><p>     A. Coalition military authorities in Iraq should issue </p><p>     a statement forbidding anyone, Iraqi or non-Iraqi, from </p><p>     dealing in stolen antiquities.  In the United States </p><p>     the Attorney General and the US Customs Service should </p><p>     make a similar announcement. </p><p> </p><p>     B. Coalition authorities should offer amnesty or reward </p><p>     to those returning stolen objects, or records of such </p><p>     objects.  There should be rewards for those providing </p><p>     information on the whereabouts of stolen material. </p><p> </p><p>     C. Coalition authorities should provide security for </p><p>     remaining objects and for other high-value cultural </p><p>     sites.  Of special importance are gold items stored in </p><p>     the National Bank building in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>     D. Coalition authorities should secure records at the </p><p>     Ministry of Finance, where there may be duplicates of </p><p>     the museum records. </p><p> </p><p>     E. Make an immediate contacts with Interpol, UNESCO, </p><p>     and governments in art market centers to ensure that </p><p>     any objects of Mesopotamian origin offered for sale on </p><p>     the international art market without proof of </p><p>     provenance will be considered to have been looted and </p><p>     must be turned over to the Iraqi authorities -- with </p><p>     rewards offered for items of special value or </p><p>     significance. </p><p> </p><p>     G. Countries where there is an important international </p><p>     art market should make public announcements similar to </p><p>     that in A above. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Following is the suggested text of a public statement </p><p>that could be issued both in Iraq in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>The people of the United States value the archeological and </p><p>cultural heritage of Iraq that documents over 10,000 years </p><p>of the development of civilization.  In recent days, the </p><p>National Museum in Baghdad has been looted as well as the </p><p>museum in Mosul and possibly archaeological sites and other </p><p>cultural institutions.  Such looting causes irretrievable </p><p>loss to our understanding of history and the efforts of </p><p>Iraqi and international scholars to study and gain new </p><p>insight into our past. </p><p> </p><p>Objects and documents taken from museums and sites are the </p><p>property of the Iraqi nation under Iraqi law.  They are </p><p>therefore stolen property, whether found in Iraq or the </p><p>United States or other nations, and anyone knowingly </p><p>possessing or dealing in such objects is committing a crime </p><p>both in Iraq and in the United States.  Such individuals may </p><p>be prosecuted under Iraqi law and under the United States\' </p><p>National Stolen Property Act.  The Iraqi people, as well as </p><p>members of the Coalition forces and others, are warned not </p><p>to handle these artifacts.  In particular, Americans are </p><p>asked not to purchase or otherwise trade in such objects as </p><p>they belo0ng to the nation of Iraq and are stolen property. </p><p> </p><p>5. POC in Kuwait is John Limbert, Office of Reconstruction </p><p>and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), mobile phone no. 965-968- </p><p>5674.   Please slug cable responses for him. </p><p> </p><p>J </p><p></p></div>
