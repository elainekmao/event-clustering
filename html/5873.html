<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000380 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS EX-IM, TDA AND OPIC </p><p>STATE PASS USTR AND DOE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, EINV, OPEC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA COMPLETES FINANCING PACT FOR BILLION </p><p>DOLLAR NATURAL GAS PROJECT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (U) On January 23, Nigeria LNG (NLNG) held a signing </p><p>ceremony for the six Nigerian banks providing $160 million of </p><p>the $1.06 billion financing for Nigeria\'s fourth and fifth </p><p>liquefied natural gas production trains. State-owned Nigerian </p><p>National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) holds 49 percent of </p><p>Nigeria LNG. (Other partners are Shell 25.6 percent, Elf 15 </p><p>percent and Agip 10.4 percent.) NLNG also announced it was </p><p>seeking financing for $460 million to construct four LNG </p><p>tankers, and NNPC announced a possible new venture with Shell </p><p>Oil and Norway\'s StatOil for a $1 billion floating natural </p><p>gas plant off Akwa Ibom\'s coast. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) NLNG\'s successful financing contrasts with recent </p><p>financing difficulties that threatened privatization of </p><p>NITEL, the national telephone company, and shipbuilder </p><p>NIGERDOCK. Banking executives said the key this time was the </p><p>nature of the business. Financing for this project posed </p><p>little risk as NLNG already has sufficient guarantees for </p><p>future sales. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The GON predicts LNG will provide 20 percent of </p><p>Nigeria\'s GDP when the first five trains are on line in late </p><p>2005. Natural gas eventually may surpass oil income, </p><p>providing Nigeria another bonanza similar to the oil boom of </p><p>the 1970s. This would offer Nigeria a second chance to use a </p><p>natural resource windfall to catalyze development. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Initial Snags in the Signing </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Only a week to a preliminary signing in London on </p><p>December 17, 2002, the Ambassador was contacted separately by </p><p>Nigeria LNG Managing Director Andrew Jamieson and Ex-Im Bank </p><p>officials concerning the wording of a GON letter of </p><p>assurances to the Export Credit Agencies (ECAs). Ex-Im and </p><p>the British, Italian, and Dutch ECAs are guaranteeing $600 </p><p>million of the loans for the fourth and fifth liquefied </p><p>natural gas trains. Ex-Im asked the Embassy to coordinate </p><p>with the British High Commission to help resolve the impasse. </p><p>The ECAs feared that hesitance by the Minister of Finance and </p><p>the Attorney General to sign the letter meant the GON was </p><p>wavering in its support for the NLNG. The ECAs also wanted an </p><p>explicit commitment that loans would be repaid directly </p><p>through NLNG\'s foreign bank accounts and not through the </p><p>GON\'s federation account, thus protecting payments from </p><p>budgetary and bureaucratic delays as well as exchange rate </p><p>losses that sometimes affect oil joint ventures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Meanwhile, Jamieson approached the Ambassador and </p><p>British High Commissioner for their assistance in </p><p>communicating with the ECAs. The Minister of Finance opposed </p><p>the Central Bank of Nigeria (which ultimately might have a </p><p>say in payment) signing the letter of assurance. Finance </p><p>Minister Ciroma believed this would signal that the NLNG debt </p><p>was sovereign debt, and not that of a private company. The </p><p>Ministry of Justice, for its part, argued that the proposed </p><p>letter of assurances went beyond the decrees of 1990 and 1993 </p><p>that created NLNG and established new obligations beyond the </p><p>scope of the law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) While the Embassy and High Commission coordinated </p><p>messages between London, Washington and Abuja, NNPC Group </p><p>Managing Director Jackson Gaius-Obaseki spoke with the </p><p>Ministers. The result was a letter of assurances that managed </p><p>to address the concerns of the Ministries, while also </p><p>satisfying the ECAs and the international lending community </p><p>at large. The Ministers of Justice and Finance appreciated </p><p>the personal assistance of Ambassador Jeter and High </p><p>Commissioner Phillip Thomas, singling them out for </p><p>recognition at the signing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Good Time Was Had By All--Almost All </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) The mood of the bankers at the January 23 signing </p><p>was very upbeat. Numbering approximately 30, the group </p><p>included representatives from the six local banks as well as </p><p>the NLNG\'s own London-based financing team and African </p><p>Development Banks officials. All were optimistic there would </p><p>be no problem in financing the next $460 million for the four </p><p>tankers, with one calling natural gas projects, "the best and </p><p>safest financing projects going." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Just a week after the signing, the Nigerian press </p><p>reported progress on a feasibility study undertaken with </p><p>Norway\'s StatOil for the $1 billion Nnwa/Doro Floating LNG </p><p>plant off the coast of Akwa Ibom. That LNG plant is one of </p><p>the three new plants the Federal Government hopes will raise </p><p>income from natural gas to at least 50 percent of crude oil </p><p>earnings by 2005. The other two are the Brass LNG project and </p><p>the Niger Delta LNG project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background on NLNG </p><p>------------------ </p><p>9. (U) The Nigeria LNG Limited was incorporated as a limited </p><p>liability company on May 17, 1989 to harness Nigeria\'s vast </p><p>natural gas resources and produce Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) </p><p>for export. At incorporation, the NLNG had a shareholding </p><p>structure of NNPC (60 percent), Shell Gas BV (20 percent), </p><p>Cleag Limited, now Total/Fina/Elf (10 percent) and Agip </p><p>International (10 percent). In 1993, the shareholding </p><p>structure changed to NNPC (49 percent), Shell (25.6 percent), </p><p>Total/Fina/Elf (15 percent), and Agip (10.4 percent). The </p><p>company has a wholly owned subsidiary, the Bonny Gas </p><p>Transport Limited (BGT), established in December 1989. BGT </p><p>provides shipping services for the NLNG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Nigeria currently has massive reserves of associated </p><p>and non-associated gas. An estimated 120 trillion cubic feet </p><p>ranks its proven reserves as the world\'s tenth largest. </p><p>Geologists believe more gas will be discovered when companies </p><p>deliberately explore for it, as opposed to inadvertently </p><p>finding it while looking for oil. Geologically speaking, many </p><p>believe the Niger Delta is a gas province with oil rims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The LNG plants are called trains. The base project </p><p>(trains 1 and 2) commenced production on September 15, 1999 </p><p>and exported the first cargo on 9th October 1999. The two </p><p>trains are currently producing at full capacity. The Final </p><p>Investment Decision (FID) on train 3 was signed in February </p><p>1999. It was ready for start-up by November 7, 2002. </p><p>Production commenced on 28 November, with first shipment on </p><p>December 17, 2002. Train 3 was completed on budget, ahead of </p><p>schedule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Also referred to as the NLNG Plus, the Final </p><p>Investment Decision (FID) on the 4th and 5th trains was </p><p>signed on March 20, 2002. Each train has a LNG capacity of 4 </p><p>million tons per annum and up to 0.5 million tons per annum </p><p>of LPG. Train 4 will be ready for start-up in June 2005 and </p><p>Train 5 in November 2005. Trains 4 and 5 will bring the </p><p>overall production capacity of the NLNG Limited to 17 million </p><p>tons per annum of LNG, one million tons of condensate and 2.3 </p><p>million tons of LPG per annum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Nine ships with individual cargo capacity of between </p><p>120,000 and 135,000 cubic meters are used for transporting </p><p>LNG from Bonny Island to buyers, mainly in Europe and the </p><p>United States. Eight are owned by the NLNG through its wholly </p><p>owned subsidiary--Bonny Gas Transport Limited (BGT)--while </p><p>the ninth, LNG Delta, is chartered on a long-term basis from </p><p>Shell Bermuda Overseas Limited. A tenth, the newly-built LNG </p><p>Bayelsa is scheduled to join the fleet this month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Eight additional ships are required to meet the </p><p>distribution needs of the project\'s increased capacity </p><p>including trains 4 and 5. In December 2001, NLNG signed a </p><p>ship building agreement with Hyundai Heavy Industries, South </p><p>Korea for the construction of four new ships. Delivery will </p><p>begin in November 2004. The other four ships will be </p><p>chartered from Bergesen A.Y.A SAU of Norway, which will build </p><p>the ships at Daewoo Shipyard in South Korea. With 18 vessels, </p><p>BGT will be the single largest LNG fleet owner in the world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>15. (SBU) Nigeria LNG is the most recent and biggest economic </p><p>success story for the GON. The importance of NLNG and natural </p><p>gas production to the Nigerian economy will continue to grow. </p><p>There are many reasons: strong support from President </p><p>Obasanjo; the recent success of similar projects in Asia and </p><p>other places; a drastic reduction in gas flaring and severe </p><p>environmental pollution; and the fact that, unlike oil, </p><p>natural gas production will not be constrained by the OPEC </p><p>quota system. NLNG\'s private sector status also means that </p><p>the industry can continue to incur heavy debts without </p><p>Nigeria becoming further buried in politically unpopular </p><p>sovereign debt. Perhaps most importantly, LNG will be a </p><p>critical new source of revenue as the GON has seen its civil </p><p>service salaries and other recurrent expenditures grow to </p><p>take up more than 80 percent of present oil revenues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) But NLNG\'s very success is seen by some as a </p><p>potential problem. World Bank Country Director Mark Tomlinson </p><p>believes that for Nigeria to get its house in order it needs </p><p>an intense economic crisis, such as the one it has barely </p><p>skirted for the last two years. Only under such dire pressure </p><p>will the government and ruling elite implement the necessary </p><p>reforms. Large-scale infusions of LNG money will encourage </p><p>Nigerian politicians and the GON to postpone the day of </p><p>reckoning and continue policies that fritter away the </p><p>nation\'s wealth--just as these same people and policies have </p><p>wasted much of the income from oil resources over the last 25 </p><p>years, Tomlinson believes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Despite high capital costs, the GON, NNPC and </p><p>foreign partners seem to have a deep thirst for LNG plants. </p><p>There are limits, however. Work on new plants will not </p><p>proceed without guaranteed markets. The GON will have to </p><p>decide if the timing is right for Nnwa/Dora and its two </p><p>companions to move forward, especially without evidence of a </p><p>stronger worldwide economic recovery. NLNG may be reaching </p><p>the end of its first growth year. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
