<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000958 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SEPT FOR INR/R, R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA, SA/PD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: Media Reaction: Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s </p><p>U.S.\'s visit </p><p> </p><p>1.  "Western support" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, "Kathmandu Post" (E/D, 5/106): "Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba returned home after...a historic and rare meeting </p><p>with U.S. President George Bush.  He obtained pledges of support </p><p>from U.S. President Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair... The </p><p>gesture, which President Bush extended in meeting the Prime </p><p>Minister is symbolic of the U.S. commitment to help new </p><p>democracies like Nepal root out terrorism and the causes that give </p><p>birth to terrorism..." </p><p> </p><p>"But the western support should not be taken for granted. The </p><p>western countries do not supply arms merely to kill one another </p><p>but to help the terrorist affected countries help themselves by </p><p>helping to hit out against terrorists and, at the same time, </p><p>addressing the state machinery towards economic, social, political </p><p>as well as infrastructure development..." </p><p> </p><p>"The Prime Minister\'s visit abroad has helped to highlight the </p><p>destructive nature of the Maoist movement and why the government </p><p>was more than justified in labeling the Maoists as \'terrorists.\'" </p><p> </p><p>2. "Deuba\'s foreign visit" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, "Kantipur" (V/D, 5/16): "...The Prime Minister\'s visit </p><p>should be considered successful in terms of receiving positive </p><p>assurance for the security and development of the country. </p><p>However, it will be a united effort of the people to get the </p><p>country out of its adverse circumstances." </p><p> </p><p>3. "Prime Minister\'s foreign visit" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, "Himalaya Times" (V/D, 5/16): "...Prime Minister </p><p>Deuba\'s visit has helped Nepal strengthen its foreign relations, </p><p>present its factual situation to the international community and </p><p>get assistance for its development programs... There is no doubt </p><p>that the meetings with such top leaders as President Bush and </p><p>Prime Minister Blair have benefited Nepal..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Deuba\'s U.S. visit: sympathy and support" </p><p> </p><p>Article, "Spotlight" (E/W, 5/17-23): "Prime Minister Deuba appears </p><p>to have succeeded in drawing the West\'s support for Nepal\'s effort </p><p>to crush the Maoist insurgency... The positive response from the </p><p>U.S. government has boosted the confidence of the Deuba </p><p>government.  Similar pledges of assistance from the British </p><p>government, too, have come at a time when the international </p><p>community has been standing solidly behind the Deuba government in </p><p>its fight against terrorists... This flurry of diplomatic activity </p><p>indicates how Nepal\'s friends are coming out in full support of </p><p>the kingdom in its hour of terrible crisis." </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
