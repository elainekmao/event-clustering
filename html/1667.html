<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000954 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR HINSON-JONES </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZER AND BYRNE </p><p>OSD FOR IKINS AND PDAS-D MCCONNELL </p><p>BANJUL FOR DCM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2011 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MASS, NI, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: POST OFR ROUND-TABLE MEETING WITH NSA MOHAMMED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 873 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. During an April 19 post-Operation FOCUS </p><p>RELIEF (OFR) round-table meeting, Nigeria,s National </p><p>Security Advisor told us that the Nigerian civilian </p><p>government has complete control of the military.  The NSA was </p><p>pleased that the OFR meeting had been positive, but deep </p><p>frustration that the MPRI payment had not been made (as he </p><p>had been assured by MOD and other officials).  General </p><p>Mohammed also supported the notion of using retired Nigerian </p><p>military officials for counterparts in the MPRI program.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Following the OFR Roundtable, Ambassador Jeter, DOD </p><p>PDAS McConnell, AF PDAS Mark Bellamy, DATT, and Counselor for </p><p>Regional Affairs called on National Security Advisor General </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed (ret).  The NSA was joined by his principal </p><p>assistant, LTC M.I. Idris. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) McConnell briefed the NSA on the results of the OFR </p><p>round-table.  McConnell said that MOD officials had agreed </p><p>that Operation FOCUS RELIEF Phase III (OFR P3) personnel </p><p>would be billeted inside the perimeter of Nigerian bases, but </p><p>would not be co-located in Nigerian barracks.  The specific </p><p>bases were not yet identified.  (COMMENT:  As noted reftel, </p><p>the Chief of Army Staff has committed to a site inspection by </p><p>Nigerian Army personnel and the DATT on April 25.  Embassy is </p><p>cautiously optimistic that the basing issue will be resolved </p><p>favorably.  END COMMENT.)  MOD officials had also agreed that </p><p>Nigerian forces would deploy to Sierra Leone for one year. </p><p>DATT then briefed the NSA on which Nigerian elements and </p><p>locations had previously been identified for P3 training.  He </p><p>also noted that in order for OFR P3 to begin on time it was </p><p>necessary for the MOD to confirm the military units selected </p><p>for the training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador advised the NSA that a meeting on the </p><p>edges of the round-table with Nigerian Chief of Army Staff </p><p>LtGen Victor Malu had gone extremely well.  Malu had told the </p><p>U.S. side that he was not opposed to OFR and his positive </p><p>attitude towards the program had been misrepresented in the </p><p>media.  The U.S. side had expressed its continuing high </p><p>regard for Malu and assured him that articles critical of him </p><p>on the Internet and in the American print media did not </p><p>represent U.S. views. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) McConnell advised the NSA of the continuing hope that </p><p>Malu would accept the standing invitation to visit the U.S. </p><p>to meet with senior U.S. defense officials to discuss OFR and </p><p>other matters of mutual interest.  Finally, McConnell </p><p>reminded the NSA that the U.S. has yet to receive Nigeria\'s </p><p>USD 3.5 million for the MPRI program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The NSA responded that the Nigerian government </p><p>remained firmly committed to OFR and that Nigerian elected </p><p>officials were completely in charge of the military.  He said </p><p>that he was pleased that the Roundtable had gone well, but </p><p>expressed surprise and frustration over the MPRI payment not </p><p>being received.  General Mohammed said that he had been </p><p>assured by senior Ministry of Finance officials that the </p><p>payment had already been made.  He again requested that the </p><p>U.S. Treasury account number where the MPRI payment would be </p><p>received be passed directly to him.  The NSA said he would </p><p>personally carry the account number to President Obasanjo to </p><p>have the President sign the order to the Nigerian Central </p><p>Bank to make immediate payment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  Later that day, the NSA\'s office passed the </p><p>Embassy copies of the Nigerian MOD documents which </p><p>transferred the MPRI payment funds from the MOD to the </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).  The documents were dated </p><p>April 18 and 19, which suggest that MOD personnel handling </p><p>the transfer of funds had been misleading the NSA for several </p><p>months concerning their delay in making the payments, or that </p><p>the Ministry of Finance had delayed the release of the funds </p><p>to the MOD.  In any case, the last step is for the CBN to </p><p>transfer the funds to the U.S. Treasury account.  Embassy </p><p>hopes this issue has now been put to rest.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In further discussions concerning MPRI, McConnell and </p><p>the Ambassador noted that the U.S. has proposed to the MOD </p><p>using retired Nigerian military personnel as counter-parts. </p><p>This solution might make it easier for the Nigerian side to </p><p>ensure regular and reliable participation in the program. </p><p>NSA Mohammed said he thought this was an excellent idea, and </p><p>said that he knew several retired generals who would be good </p><p>for the program.  He named retired Generals Archibong and </p><p>Jaffar Isa, both of whom were also strong supporters of OFR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The meeting concluded with Ambassador Jeter noting </p><p>that the discussion during the roundtable had been frank and </p><p>productive, giving hope that both programs could now move </p><p>forward expeditiously.  While other issues would certainly </p><p>arise, they could be handled in a collaborative way.  The NSA </p><p>agreed that this was now the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT: As noted reftel, there are still hurdles to </p><p>overcome before we can be confident that OFR3 will begin on </p><p>time in Nigeria.  However, after an open and productive </p><p>roundtable, and a clear message of support from the NSA, </p><p>Embassy is hopeful that the Nigerian defense establishment is </p><p>now ready to move forward productively.  The </p><p>retirement/dismissal of General Malu and his cohorts should </p><p>now pave the way.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
