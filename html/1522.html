REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) WILFRED MHANDA, LEADER OF THE ZIMBABWE LIBERATORS\' </p><p>PLATFORM, A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION SEEKING TO RESTORE THE </p><p>GOOD NAME OF WAR VETERANS, TOLD CHARGE AND POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF ON FEBRUARY 8 THAT VERY FEW EX-COMBATANTS ARE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS TO COW OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORTERS, THE JUDICIARY, AND THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA.  THE </p><p>MAN LEADING THE GOVERNMENT\'S CAMPAIGN OF TERROR, ZANU-PF MP </p><p>CHENJERAI HUNZVI, IS NOT A GENUINE WAR VETERAN AND DOES NOT </p><p>REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF MOST EX-COMBATANTS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>MHANDA.  SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE TOLD MHANDA THAT </p><p>HUNZVI COULD BE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL IN FIVE MINUTES, </p><p>SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT DECIDE TO DO SO.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WILFRED MHANDA, LEADER OF THE ZIMBABWE LIBERATORS\' </p><p>PLATFORM, A MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION OF WAR VETERANS, CALLED </p><p>ON THE CHARGE ON FEBRUARY 8.  MHANDA WAS JOINED BY ADVISOR </p><p>HAPPYSON NENJI.  CHARGE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF. </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE LIBERATORS\' PLATFORM </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MHANDA SAID THE ZIMBABWE LIBERATORS\' PLATFORM WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00695  01 OF 02  091230Z </p><p>FORMED TO WORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FREEDOMS </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS FOUGHT FOR DURING THE WAR OF LIBERATION. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, THE ORGANIZATION IS STRIVING TO RESTORE THE </p><p>GOOD NAME OF WAR VETERANS, TO ASSIST THEM IN BECOMING </p><p>ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE, REDUCING THEIR VULNERABILITY TO </p><p>POLITICAL MANIPULATION, PRESSING FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NON-RACIAL DEMOCRACY. </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 500 EX-COMBATANTS HAVE PAID THEIR MEMBERSHIP </p><p>DUES IN THE ZLP, AND MHANDA FELT CONFIDENT THAT THAT NUMBER </p><p>WOULD INCREASE.  NOTING THAT HIS ORGANIZATION CURRENTLY </p><p>CANNOT AFFORD OFFICE SPACE, MHANDA MADE A PITCH FOR </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, NOTING THAT, WITHOUT SUCH RESOURCES, </p><p>GROUPS LIKE HIS CANNOT PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE </p><p>VOICE AND CANNOT HOPE TO COMPETE FOR POLITICAL SPACE WITH A </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH FULL ACCESS TO THE STATE MACHINERY. </p><p> </p><p>VERY FEW WAR VETS INVOLVED IN MUGABE\'S VIOLENT CAMPAIGN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE CHARGE SOLICITED MHANDA\'S ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE NATIONAL LIBERATION WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION </p><p>(ZNLWVA) LED BY CHENJERAI "HITLER" HUNZVI, NOTING THAT </p><p>HUNZVI AND HIS BAND OF WAR VETERANS HAVE PLAYED A LARGE </p><p>ROLE IN BLACKENING ZIMBABWE\'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE.  THE </p><p>ZNLWVA, MHANDA REPLIED, IS NO LONGER A FUNCTIONING </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  IT HAS CEASED TO SERVE THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH </p><p>IT WAS FOUNDED -- REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF EX- </p><p>COMBATANTS -- BUT, RATHER, HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE TO BE USED AS A ZANU-PF MILITIA.  HUNZVI, MHANDA </p><p>CLAIMED, IS NOT HIMSELF A GENUINE EX-COMBATANT.  HUNZVI HAS </p><p>NO INDEPENDENT SUPPORT BASE AND, MHANDA ASSERTED, HAS BEEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00695  01 OF 02  091230Z </p><p>GIVEN LITTLE ROOM FOR MANEUVER BY MUGABE.  HUNZVI\'S PRIMARY </p><p>VALUE LIES IN GIVING PRESIDENT MUGABE PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY </p><p>BY SERVING AS THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S CAMPAIGN </p><p>OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION.  ACCORDING TO MHANDA, THE </p><p>DECISION TO INVADE COMMERCIAL FARMS AND TO COW OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORTERS WAS MADE BY PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS MILITARY </p><p>SERVICE CHIEFS, NOT BY HUNZVI. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MHANDA INSISTED THAT VERY FEW OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 40,000 WAR VETERANS ARE WORKING WITH HUNZVI </p><p>AND HIS THUGS.  ABOUT HALF OF THE EX-COMBATANTS ARE STILL </p><p>SERVING IN THE ARMY, WHILE MOST OF THE REMAINING 20,000 ARE </p><p>GAINFULLY EMPLOYED ELSEWHERE IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE </p><p>SECTORS.  MHANDA ESTIMATED THAT FEWER THAN 100 GENUINE </p><p>LIBERATION WAR VETERANS, IN ADDITION TO LARGER NUMBERS OF </p><p>ZANU-PF THUGS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING OUT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AGAINST </p><p>OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, THE JUDICIARY, AND THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>MEDIA, AS WELL AS OCCUPYING COMMERCIAL FARMS.  THE MILITARY </p><p>SERVICE CHIEFS HAVE TOLD MHANDA THEY COULD BRING HUNZVI </p><p>UNDER CONTROL IN FIVE MINUTES.  THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE NOT </p><p>DONE SO, MHANDA SURMISED, CONFIRMS THAT HUNZVI AND HIS </p><p>SHOCK TROOPS ARE CONTINUING TO SERVE A USEFUL ROLE FOR </p><p>ZANU-PF.  FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT HUNZVI AND THE "WAR </p><p>VETERANS" ARE LITTLE MORE THAN PAWNS, OUR INTERLOCUTOR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0227 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00695  02 OF 02  091230Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------C36BE3  091231Z /38 </p><p>R 091232Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8203 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 02/05/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ALTERNATIVE WAR VETERANS\' GROUP SEEKS TO RESTORE </p><p>GOOD NAME OF THOSE WHO WAGED THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00695  02 OF 02  091230Z </p><p>NOTED, IS THE FACT THAT NONE OF THEM WERE GIVEN CABINET </p><p>RANK PORTFOLIOS OR WERE BROUGHT INTO THE ZANU-PF POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WE FOUND MHANDA TO BE BRIGHT AND ARTICULATE, AND </p><p>EMBARRASSED THAT THE REPUTATION OF "WAR VETERANS" HAS BEEN </p><p>DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD.  HE WAS AT GREAT PAINS TO EXPLAIN </p><p>THAT HITLER HUNZVI AND MOST OF THOSE UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, </p><p>NEVER FOUGHT IN THE LIBERATION WAR.  THE SUBSTANCE OF </p><p>MHANDA\'S CONTENTION HAS BEEN WIDELY ACCEPTED IN ZIMBABWE, </p><p>BUT THE ZLP LEADER WAS TROUBLED THAT BOTH DOMESTIC AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEDIA CONTINUE TO DESCRIBE HUNZVI AND HIS </p><p>HENCHMEN AS WAR VETERANS.   MHANDA WAS CLEARLY CONTEMPTUOUS </p><p>OF HUNZVI, AND WE CONSIDER CREDIBLE HIS DECLARATION THAT </p><p>THE ZANU-PF MP DOES NOT SPEAK FOR THE MAJORITY OF WAR </p><p>VETERANS BUT, IN FACT, HAS DESTROYED THE ORGANIZATION SET </p><p>UP TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF EX-COMBATANTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HUNZVI HAS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>CONSTITUENCY OF ONE --  PRESIDENT MUGABE.  THERE IS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS </p><p>GIVEN HUNZVI GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH CARTE BLANCHE ON </p><p>TACTICS TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE RULING PARTY </p><p>WINS PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTIONS AND THE BIGGEST PRIZE OF </p><p>ALL: THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  HUNZVI CLEARLY HAS </p><p>TAKEN ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY WITH PATHOLOGICAL ENTHUSIASM, </p><p>EVIDENT IN HIS SUPERVISION OF -- AND PERSONAL PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN -- TERROR CAMPAIGNS AGAINST OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN </p><p>ADVANCE OF BY-ELECTIONS IN MARONDERA AND BIKITA.  HUNZVI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00695  02 OF 02  091230Z </p><p>HAS MOST RECENTLY TAKEN THE LEAD IN CARRYING OUT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE JUDICIARY AND THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT MEDIA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
