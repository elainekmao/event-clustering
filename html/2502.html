(A) KATHMANDU 2277 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 2278 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 2279 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: H. EGGLESTON. REASONS 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) This is the fifth request for imagery support for the </p><p>Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) to conduct offensive operations against </p><p>Maoist rebels. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) This request is the direct result of a large-scale attack </p><p>on GON personnel in Achham District.  RNA anticipates that Maoist </p><p>insurgents are moving to the area indicated by the following </p><p>coordinates: </p><p> </p><p>- 81 degrees 10 min 30 sec to 81 degrees 30 min 00 sec East </p><p>- and 29 degrees 05 min 00 sec to 29 degrees 12 min 30 sec North. </p><p>- Refer to Map Sheet Numbers 2981-13B and D, 2981-14 A and C. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) The Maoist attacks inflicted heavy RNA, police and civilian </p><p>casualties (see septel).  Initial, but necessarily sketchy, reports </p><p>indicate that the attacks were carried out by one thousand-plus </p><p>Maoist cadre and an additional several hundred load bearers.  An </p><p>unconfirmed report indicates that the Maoists used mortars, captured </p><p>from the RNA in November, in this attack. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
