<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 002008 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/PPD: MOONEY, MACINNES, GAFFNEY </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/RA KEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KWMN, PGOV, KDEM, KPAO, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMOCRACY SMALL GRANT PROPOSAL FOR GENDER </p><p>BUDGETING STUDY IN KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 91641 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Embassy Kuwait requests an NEA Democracy Small Grant of </p><p>$25,000 to sponsor a gender-budgeting study to be carried out </p><p>by the Kuwait Economic Society. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE PROBLEM </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Women, who do not have the right to vote, have little </p><p>opportunity to influence policy in Kuwait, and women\'s rights </p><p>activists point to overwhelming apathy as one of the greatest </p><p>obstacles in their path to equality.  Many of those who </p><p>oppose women\'s rights hide behind the high standard of living </p><p>enjoyed by all Kuwaiti citizens; these critics feel Kuwaiti </p><p>women have no need to gain political equality to improve </p><p>their situations because they experience no suffering and </p><p>want for nothing. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Recognizing that a direct push for political rights does </p><p>not appeal to many Kuwaiti women, women\'s rights activists </p><p>now hope to use the issue of economic inequalities to gather </p><p>support for reforms from conservative women.  They are </p><p>attempting to draw attention to economic inequalities to </p><p>demonstrate to Kuwaiti women that their lack of political </p><p>rights has far reaching consequences.  By highlighting the </p><p>ways in which the disenfranchisement translates into economic </p><p>disadvantages for women and their children, women\'s rights </p><p>activists hope to raise awareness and interest among more </p><p>conservative women.  Activists hope that presenting women </p><p>with evidence that they are not receiving their fair share of </p><p>economic benefits from the government will energize women to </p><p>agitate for a voice in that government. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE PROJECT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  To help develop this new strategy for gaining support for </p><p>political rights for women, Embassy Kuwait requests an NEA </p><p>Democracy Small Grant (DSG) to sponsor a gender-budgeting </p><p>study to be carried out by the Kuwait Economic Society.  The </p><p>DSG would fund a gender-sensitive analysis of the most recent </p><p>available Kuwaiti budget, and the publication of that </p><p>analysis.  Embassy Kuwait believes the study will bolster </p><p>claims by women\'s rights activists that lack of a voice in </p><p>politics translates into concrete economic disadvantages for </p><p>women and their children. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Gender-budgeting (GB) is a method of examining the </p><p>government budget to determine its different impacts on men </p><p>and women, and can be used to gender-analyze macroeconomic </p><p>policy.  GB initiatives reflect the growing move toward more </p><p>open, participatory, and responsive systems of governance; </p><p>since 1985, 20 countries have used GB techniques as part of </p><p>their budget development process.  GB initiatives bring the </p><p>issue of gender equity in resource allocation to the </p><p>attention of legislators, and analyze the extent to which </p><p>budgets reflect the different roles that men and women play </p><p>in the economy.  Both women and men contribute to the </p><p>economy, but are neither equally distributed across sectors </p><p>nor equally remunerated for their labor.  For example, </p><p>women\'s unpaid domestic labor and reproductive work maintains </p><p>the social framework and the future labor force, but is </p><p>rarely formally recognized as a contribution to the economy. </p><p> Aiming to influence budget decision-making, GB initiatives </p><p>propose resource re-allocations to close gender gaps and to </p><p>address the unmet needs of women and girls.  Women\'s rights </p><p>activists will share the results of the GB study with </p><p>parliamentarians and use the findings to advocate for gender </p><p>equality in budget allocations. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE PLAYERS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Kuwait Economic Society (KES) was established in 1970 </p><p>to encourage scientific research to contribute to economic </p><p>development in Kuwait.  The KES cooperates with foreign and </p><p>international organizations to further its objectives of </p><p>economic liberalization.  The KES is a force for much-needed </p><p>reform of the Kuwaiti economy and is one of the Embassy\'s </p><p>best economic contact organizations.  The KES hosts monthly </p><p>seminars to discuss economic and social developments in </p><p>Kuwait, as well as bi-annual conferences addressing key </p><p>economic issues such as the WTO, privatization, and the oil </p><p>industry.  Most importantly from the perspective of this </p><p>project, the KES regularly participates in the legislative </p><p>process pertaining to the economy; the National Assembly </p><p>consults with the KES on draft laws dealing with economic </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>THE PLAN </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  The KES estimates it will take 6 months to complete the </p><p>study.  They envision using a nine-person team to perform the </p><p>budget analysis: 1 team leader/coordinator, 1 outside </p><p>consultant (recommended by the World Bank), 6 local analysts </p><p>to gather information and statistics, and 1 administrative </p><p>assistant to provide office support.  The information </p><p>gathering and administrative work will all be done by local </p><p>staff; the outside consultant will spend approximately 1 </p><p>month in country gathering and analyzing the data.  The </p><p>consultant will return once the report is completed to </p><p>present the results. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Post requests a grant of $25,000 to cover costs </p><p>associated with this project.  The Kuwait Economic Society </p><p>will provide and pay for the local staff necessary for </p><p>information gathering and support.  The Democracy Small Grant </p><p>will cover the costs of the outside consultant brought in to </p><p>perform the budget analysis.  The cost breakdown is as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>Initial assessment </p><p>Consultant Fee: $12,600 ($450/day for 28 days) </p><p>Round-trip airline ticket to Kuwait: $1500 </p><p>Lodging and M&IE: $6944 ($248/day for 28 days) </p><p> </p><p>Follow-up visit to present results </p><p>Consultant Fee: $2250 ($450/day for 5 days) </p><p>Round-trip airline ticket to Kuwait: $1500 </p><p>Lodging and M&IE: $1240 ($248/day for 5 days) </p><p> </p><p>Total estimated cost for the consultant is $26,034.  The </p><p>Kuwait Economic Society has committed to make up the </p><p>difference between the Democracy Small Grant and the cost of </p><p>the project. </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
