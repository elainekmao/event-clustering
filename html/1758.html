<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001376 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S AND AF/W </p><p>DEPT PASS NSC </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR RWHITAKER, BSCHWARTZ, JROTH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, NI, SF, AG, OAU </p><p>SUBJECT:  INTERIM REPORT ON MAP WORKSHOP </p><p>          AT ABUJA JUNE 2-4, 2001 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is a brief interim report; comprehensive </p><p>report to follow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>State of play </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) At the fifth session of the five-nation </p><p>Steering Committee of the Millennium Partnership for </p><p>African Recovery Programme (MAP) held at Pretoria in </p><p>March it was agreed to convene a workshop to elaborate </p><p>a detailed "Programme of Action" for implementing the </p><p>basic MAP proposals developed during the first five </p><p>Steering Committee meetings.  Subsequently, the </p><p>Steering Committee met at Abuja June 2-4 for a </p><p>workshop chaired by South Africa and Nigeria with </p><p>limited participation by Algeria, Egypt and Senegal. </p><p>Sidebar meetings continued throughout the week of June </p><p>4, concluding on June 9. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The MAP workshop session started with a five- </p><p>member Steering Committee: Algeria, South Africa, </p><p>Nigeria, Egypt and Senegal.  Subsequent to the </p><p>official sessions, the Steering Committee was expanded </p><p>to include four new members: Gabon, Mali, Tanzania and </p><p>Mozambique.  The new members participated as observers </p><p>during the official sessions, but did not have </p><p>representation in the breakout groups that met to </p><p>develop action plans for achieving specific MAP </p><p>objectives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The MAP workshop failed to achieve its </p><p>stated objective of preparing detailed action plans </p><p>for implementing the MAP objectives as set out in the </p><p>theme document, version 3A.  Specifically, Senegal\'s </p><p>competing "Omega Plan" for infrastructure </p><p>rehabilitation and development was not integrated into </p><p>MAP proper and the several breakout groups developing </p><p>sub-themes of the MAP did not finalize their products. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Development assistance jargon characterized </p><p>the breakout groups\' discussions with their calls, </p><p>e.g., for "rationalized regulatory structures, </p><p>transparency, capacity building, sanctity of contract, </p><p>private sector-led initiatives."  Several of the </p><p>groups did produce written reports, but most of these </p><p>were more exercises in textbook responses with laundry </p><p>lists of problems than substantive programs for </p><p>development.  Decision on integrating the "Omega Plan" </p><p>into MAP was deferred for "later action." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Next Steps </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The official sessions closed on June 4 </p><p>without a clear outline of the expectations for next </p><p>steps.  Next locations (see para 6) for meetings were </p><p>discussed, but no official Steering Board decision was </p><p>taken on precisely what were to be the parameters for </p><p>further development of MAP.  In a brief sidebar </p><p>discussion with Ambassador Jeter, President Mbeki\'s </p><p>Economic Advisor Wiseman Nkuhlu did offer his own </p><p>thoughts impromptu, however: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- MAP is a work in progress.  Additional </p><p>meetings will be required to "finalize" a MAP strategy </p><p>paper for eventual presentation to potential donors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- MAP should be presented to OAU leadership at a </p><p>"Special Council" or "Heads of State meeting" </p><p>preceding the upcoming OAU Summit.  OAU will be asked </p><p>to endorse that MAP document as embodying the only </p><p>valid continent-wide development program.  MAP, </p><p>however, must remain "separate and apart" from the OAU </p><p>and staffed with its own secretariat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The MAP leadership plans to approach G8 </p><p>leadership at the G8 gathering in Genoa on July 1. </p><p>The manner of the approach remains "undecided," but </p><p>could take the form of a dinner hosted (at MAP\'s </p><p>request) by Italy, the current chair, attended by the </p><p>G8 leadership and the "big three" of MAP: South </p><p>Africa, Algeria and Nigeria.  An alternative could be </p><p>the presentation of a brief paper (20 pages or so) at </p><p>the margins of the G8 that outlines MAP expectations </p><p>regarding assistance and donor coordination.  Whatever </p><p>the form the encounter takes, Nkuhlu identified these </p><p>issues as the ones of initial MAP interest: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> --- Discussion of the particulars of a </p><p>global fund for combating HIV/AIDS and other </p><p>communicable diseases.  South Africa is working </p><p>directly with the WHO to ensure the presentation of a </p><p>plan that is consistent with other offers on the table </p><p>already. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> --- Renewal of the discussion regarding, and </p><p>a request for concrete follow up on, the G8\'s "pledge </p><p>to bridge the digital gap" made at last year\'s G8 held </p><p>at Guam. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> --- Discussion of special WTO conditions for </p><p>Africa that would permit the continent increased </p><p>access to developed markets, i.e., Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(And, to be added should the MAP Steering Committee </p><p>actually develop an elaborated program in time for the </p><p>Genoa meeting): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  --- Discussion of a subset of the 72 </p><p>infrastructure programs, e.g., roads, power, airports, </p><p>needed to make African nations competitive in the </p><p>global marketplace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>The Debate Continues: Next Locations </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Shortly after the official sessions ended, the </p><p>Steering Committee decided on new venues to continue </p><p>the debate over integration of the "Omega Plan," and </p><p>to continue the work on forging a real plan of action </p><p>for MAP: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>June 11-15 Pretoria to discuss draft 3A program </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>June 18-20 Cairo to complete the 3A draft program </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>June 11-13 Dakar to settle on integrating the </p><p>"Omega Plan" into MAP proper </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment.  At Abuja, June 2-4, we saw no </p><p>significant headway made in developing a goals-based </p><p>consensus plan of action for MAP.  As summarized </p><p>succinctly by one of our Egyptian interlocutors, "No </p><p>detailed action plan was developed beyond what exists </p><p>in the 3A document already; not even the Omega Plan </p><p>was integrated into MAP."  Our evaluation is not that </p><p>negative. A few of the working groups presented </p><p>documents that eschewed rhetoric and were more than </p><p>mere laundry lists of problems or wishes. </p><p>Nevertheless, much remains to be done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Comment continued.  The MAP has "issues, </p><p>not the least of which is the participants\' unequal </p><p>levels of commitment to the program.  Without </p><p>question, the Abuja session -- held in Nigeria to </p><p>great fanfare by the press and government </p><p>spokespersons -- was a South Africa-led and managed </p><p>operation from start to finish.  The Nigerian co-host </p><p>responsibilities consisted mostly of co-chairing the </p><p>general sessions and hosting dinners and cocktails. </p><p>Substantive participation by the GON was uninspiring. </p><p>For example, the Nigerian delegation showed up four </p><p>hours late for the one session that they were to have </p><p>chaired.  All the major papers presented were South </p><p>African drafts; South Africa chaired or led most of </p><p>the meetings; the logistical support was provided by </p><p>the Development Bank of South Africa and a private </p><p>firm hired in South Africa was brought to Abuja to </p><p>copy, collate, and distribute the papers, as well as </p><p>to arrange for the meetings\' venue and the housing and </p><p>transportation of the attendees.  Neither did Algeria </p><p>or Egypt contribute much to the effort beyond a couple </p><p>of uninspiring papers.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
