<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002371 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU, CY </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY/CYPRUS: TURK WAXES INDIGNANT AT GREEK </p><p>CYPRIOT UN GAME PLAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA Deputy U/S for Bilateral Political Affairs Baki </p><p>Ilkin summoned reps from UNSC member countries April 11 to </p><p>convey in a meandering fashion Ankara\'s concern with the </p><p>"funny game" being played by Greek Cypriots in the UN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>It\'s Not Fair! </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) While admitting that Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas </p><p>had been outmaneuvered by Cyprus President Papadopoulos at </p><p>the Hague, Ilkin decried Greek Cypriots for: (1) wanting to </p><p>leave out any reference to the Annan Plan in a UNSC </p><p>resolution; and (2) attempting to delay a resolution until </p><p>after April 16, when Cyprus will officially join the EU.  His </p><p>main objective was clearly to suggest that Denktas not be </p><p>criticized, since the discussion of the resolution showed the </p><p>Greek Cypriots\' true reaction to the Annan Plan.  "The Greek </p><p>Cypriots will be rewarded for leaving out the Annan Plan, </p><p>which they previously had accepted.  How can Greek Cypriots </p><p>get the credit?" he pleaded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ilkin further noted that he, "personally," did not </p><p>object to the inclusion of a reference to the Annan Plan in a </p><p>UNSC resolution but said that was up to the Council members. </p><p>That said, "I can\'t say if Turkey views the draft resolution </p><p>positively" -- nor whether the GOT or Denktas accepts the </p><p>Annan Plan as the basis of negotiations.  In reply, DCM </p><p>pointed out that US supported quick passage of a resolution </p><p>that: (1) contains a clear reference to UNSYG\'s Good Offices </p><p>mission; and (2) will keep the Annan Plan at the center of </p><p>future negotiations. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
