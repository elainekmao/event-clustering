<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 003187 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE, EUR/PPD AND DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CHIEF JUSTICE DISCUSSES ROLE </p><p>OF CONSTITUTION, RELIGION </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: In a May 8 meeting with Ambassador, </p><p>Constitutional Court Chief Justice Mustafa Bumin discussed </p><p>his views on: the ruling AK Party; the threat of Islamic </p><p>fundamentalism in Turkey; the role of the Constitution in a </p><p>State of law; and the recent law lowering the retirement age </p><p>for civil servants.  Bumin is scheduled to visit the U.S. May </p><p>17-31 for a series of meetings in Washington, D.C. and San </p><p>Francisco.  His comments provide insight into his views.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Court Blocks Retirement Law </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Bumin told Ambassador the Constitutional Court announced </p><p>May 8 it had stopped the implementation of the new law </p><p>lowering the retirement age for civil servants from 65 to 61. </p><p> He said the Court reached this decision because: 1) there </p><p>should be a transition period to allow workers to make </p><p>retirement plans, since for years they expected and planned </p><p>for retirement at 65, and 2) this law improperly transfers </p><p>powers from the legislative branch to the executive by </p><p>permitting the terms of selected civil servants -- such as </p><p>governors, ambassadors, and undersecretaries -- to be </p><p>extended by the Cabinet.  These decisions would be </p><p>subjective.  The personnel rights of civil servants in Turkey </p><p>are regulated by law.  The Court decided to stop </p><p>implementation of the law because a decision to annul the law </p><p>would have taken 4-5 months to carry out, whereas a decision </p><p>to stop implementation takes effect as soon as it is </p><p>published in the Official Gazette.  Bumin quipped that the </p><p>decision is a "gift" for Turkish Ambassador to the U.S. </p><p>Logoglu, who would have had to retire under the new law </p><p>(Note: Bumin\'s wife is a good friend of Mrs. Logoglu. End </p><p>Note).  In general, he said, the Court blocks implementation </p><p>of laws when there is a high probability the law will be </p><p>annulled, and when it is clear that the consequences of </p><p>implementation would be difficult to address after the fact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Yes to Free Speech, No to "Fundamentalism" </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Bumin defined himself as a "humanist" and said when he was </p><p>elected Court Chairman he told his colleagues they were all </p><p>free to express their views, but he would not tolerate </p><p>fighting.  He has studied decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court </p><p>and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and noticed </p><p>many similarities.  One common thread is the belief that an </p><p>idea can be controversial, even shocking, but its expression </p><p>must be tolerated.  Bumin said his ideas have changed </p><p>repeatedly over the course of his life, as is natural. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Ambassador noted that Ataturk had challenged many </p><p>conventional ideas, but after Ataturk\'s death many of his </p><p>followers determined such challenges unacceptable.  Bumin </p><p>said Turkey enjoys "the best form of secularism."  Two years </p><p>ago, the ECHR President came to visit him.  At that time, the </p><p>ECHR was preparing to review an appeal of the GOT\'s 1998 </p><p>decision to close the Islamist Refah Party.  Bumin said he </p><p>explained to the ECHR President that while Europe had long </p><p>ago eliminated the influence of religion in politics, Turkey </p><p>could not.  Unfortunately, he asserted, there are people in </p><p>Turkey actively seeking to exploit religious feeling for </p><p>political ends.  In addition, Turkey\'s Islamic neighbors to </p><p>the south and east promote fundamentalism in Turkey.  The GOT </p><p>shut down Refah because, Bumin opined, it had become a center </p><p>of anti-secular activities, including by promoting Sharia </p><p>law.  He explained the danger of religious fundamentalism in </p><p>Turkey, and urged the ECHR not to be naive when it reviewed </p><p>the case.  If the ECHR ruled against the closure, it would </p><p>bear the responsibility if Turkey drifted toward Islamic </p><p>fundamentalism.  Later, Bumin and the other Court justices </p><p>visited the ECHR in Strasbourg and exchanged views.  Their </p><p>efforts bore fruit when the ECHR ruled in 2001 to reject </p><p>Refah\'s appeal.  If the ruling had gone the other way, the </p><p>consequences would have been very bad, Bumin claimed.  In </p><p>general, Bumin said he does not like closing parties. </p><p>However, both the Constitution and the Political Parties law </p><p>require closure in certain cases.  Under a recent </p><p>constitutional amendment, the Constitutional Court has the </p><p>authority to amend the Political Parties Law.  The Court is </p><p>now reviewing the Law and will likely cancel many articles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Bumin: AK Lacks Experience, Understanding </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>5. Bumin said ruling AK Party leaders do not understand yet </p><p>how the State works, but we must not lose hope in them.  He </p><p>said he has told both PM Erdogan and Speaker of Parliament </p><p>Arinc that more than half the votes for AK in the November </p><p>elections were protest votes, rather than votes from loyal AK </p><p>supporters.  As an Islam-oriented party, AK can play a </p><p>valuable role in power if it respects the principles of the </p><p>secular Republic.  If it does  not, however, the consequences </p><p>will be terrible.  Unlike in some other countries, you don\'t </p><p>need a specific education to enter government in Turkey.  In </p><p>France, for example, graduates of the National School of </p><p>Administration run the country.  There is also a problem with </p><p>the concept of merit.  The personnel law in Turkey requires </p><p>that certain government officials have certain </p><p>qualifications.  Unfortunately, there are no such </p><p>requirements for being elected to the Turkish Parliament, he </p><p>added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>The Role of the Constitution in a State of Law </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Ambassador asked about the prospects of the GOT drafting a </p><p>new Constitution, rather than making piecemeal amendments to </p><p>the existing one.  Bumin noted that the current Constitution </p><p>was drafted in 1982, under the influence of the military, </p><p>which had staged a coup in 1980.  Its authoritarian nature </p><p>was a reaction to the freedoms of the previous Constitution, </p><p>drafted in 1961.  He said he gave a speech on April 25, the </p><p>41st anniversary of the Constitutional Court, in which he </p><p>stressed that the Constitution should not be amended for </p><p>special situations.  In other words, if you cannot accomplish </p><p>something by changing a law, you should not try to achieve </p><p>that end by amending the Constitution.  The Constitutional </p><p>Court can oversee constitutional amendments only from a </p><p>procedural point of view -- i.e. whether the amendment was </p><p>adopted according to procedures.  The Court cannot review the </p><p>contents.  Some people therefore might try to use the </p><p>constitutional amendment process instead of the normal </p><p>legislative process, where the Court can review the actual </p><p>content.  In a state of law, you cannot change the </p><p>Constitution in order to evade Constitutional Court control. </p><p>Bumin said that when he made these comments during his </p><p>speech, he looked directly at Erdogan, Arinc, President </p><p>Sezer, and Justice Minister Cicek.  He said AK could use its </p><p>majority in Parliament to change laws, but unless these laws </p><p>comply with international norms they cannot become legally </p><p>binding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Ambassador asked Bumin for his reaction to recent comments </p><p>by Arinc that seemed to imply that natural law, or </p><p>parliamentary authority, might be above the Constitution. </p><p>Bumin noted that Arinc is a lawyer, and said he did not </p><p>believe Arinc intended his words to have that meaning. </p><p>Article 2 of the Constitution states that Turkey is a state </p><p>of law.  There are certain things that cannot be changed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Bumin sincerely believes himself to be an advocate of a </p><p>state of law, but his comments reveal how incomplete that </p><p>concept is in Turkey.  We request that interlocutors for </p><p>Bumin\'s upcoming visit be informed about his views, but </p><p>equally try to draw him out on key issues in order to </p><p>stimulate his thinking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
