<p>S E C R E T COLOMBO 000596 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/IP/SA, DS/DSS/ITA, DSERCC AND SA/INS </p><p>ISLAMABAD PASS LAHORE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  1.6 X1, X6 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AEMR, PTER, CASC, CE, MIssion Security </p><p>SUBJECT:  COLOMBO EAC MEETING APRIL 8, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) Colombo 548, (B) Colombo 582 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by S.V. Wright, Regional Security </p><p>Officer, reason 1.5 (C) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On April 8, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action </p><p>Committee (EAC) met to discuss the local security situation. </p><p>The DCM chaired the EAC. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The EAC agreed that Colombo appears calm; the </p><p>trend is of decreasing agitation.  There was a relatively </p><p>minor protest on Friday April 4 that - given the police </p><p>refusal to allow protests near the U.S. Embassy - </p><p>concentrated on the Saudi and UAE Embassies.  About 300 </p><p>people protested the War and burned American flags. </p><p>Although the road in front of the Chancery was briefly </p><p>closed as a precaution, the demonstration ended peacefully. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) The RSO briefed the EAC on updated information </p><p>relating to possible Iraqi surveillance in Colombo (see </p><p>reftels).  Recent information obtained by PII and the Sri </p><p>Lanka Police indicate the subject identified may be a </p><p>bonafide Iraqi businessman.  Inquiries are continuing, </p><p>however. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The EAC decided to disband the use of the LAV </p><p>shuttle effective Friday April 11 unless the security </p><p>situation degrades.  The current progress in the War and </p><p>lack of an emotional reaction in Colombo led the EAC to </p><p>slightly reduce our security posture. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The local police will remain deployed at all the </p><p>residence for at least one more week. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The EAC decided to continue the travel </p><p>restriction for the east of Sri Lanka.  It did, however, </p><p>approve a USAID trip to the northern Jaffna peninsula. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The committee agreed to meet again on Tuesday </p><p>April 15. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
