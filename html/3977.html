<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005967 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON CONGRESS\' DECISION ON IRAQ </p><p>AND TERRORIST INCIDENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>--  Lead stories over the weekend, October 11-15, </p><p>highlight developments in the region.  Reports </p><p>highlight the Congress\' decision authorizing President </p><p>Bush to launch war on Iraq and the President\'s </p><p>response to that decision, maintaining that Iraq\'s </p><p>"days as an outlaw state are numbered".  Papers over </p><p>the weekend also highlight a New York Times article </p><p>that discussed U.S. plans for a "military occupation" </p><p>of Iraq.  Front-page stories continue to report on </p><p>Israel\'s "barbaric" attacks against Palestinian </p><p>civilians. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Who awoke the sleeping cell?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(10/11):  "It was a big shock for the American marines </p><p>that the first terrorist attack before the war on Iraq </p><p>would come from within Kuwait itself.  The attackers </p><p>may have links with Al-Qa\'eda, and Kuwaiti officials </p><p>may talk about a sleeping terrorist cell, but it is </p><p>impossible to deny the hostile feelings that Kuwaitis </p><p>have for the United States.  Nothing proves best the </p><p>fact that U.S. policies are responsible for the </p><p>deepening hatred of the people of this region for the </p><p>United States than what has happened in Kuwait.  If </p><p>this responsibility is being blamed in one way or </p><p>another on the Islamic culture or the poverty and </p><p>backwardness, then this does not apply to the people </p><p>of Kuwait who enjoy a good standard of living." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Attack against the marines" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/11):  "The attack against the marines in Kuwait </p><p>has major and serious implications.  The attack took </p><p>place in Kuwait, the one place where Americans thought </p><p>that their forces would not face such an attack, </p><p>simply because they `liberated\' Kuwait, and so the </p><p>Kuwaitis must show their appreciation.  Yet, the </p><p>injustices that the United States is inflicting upon </p><p>the Arabs is going to push even U.S. supporters to get </p><p>angry at the way the Arab nation is being despised and </p><p>at the way the feelings of the Arab people are being </p><p>disregarded.  The blatant bias for Sharon\'s policy and </p><p>the Israeli occupation, supporting the declaration of </p><p>Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital, continuing the </p><p>slaughter of Palestinians, occupying Arab oil sources, </p><p>threatening to strike Iraq and change its regime, will </p><p>all increase the hatred of America and increase at the </p><p>same the popularity of Bin Laden and the </p><p>fundamentalists and extremists who will take over the </p><p>Arab streets after their governments have bowed to </p><p>America\'s dictates." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Blank check" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i </p><p>(10/15):  "The U.S. congressional decision to </p><p>authorize President Bush to launch war on Iraq is not </p><p>a blank check, and it is not an authorization to </p><p>declare war as newspapers have said.  The decision has </p><p>tied the President\'s hands and placed conditions that </p><p>are hard to meet.  It is very likely that such an </p><p>attack [on Iraq] will yield more terrorists who will </p><p>target America and seek revenge.  The most important </p><p>source for anti-American terrorism lies in the Arabs </p><p>and Muslims\' feelings of degradation and insult and </p><p>complete helplessness in the face of America\'s power. </p><p>Without a doubt, occupying Iraq and appointing a </p><p>American military governor in Baghdad will be the </p><p>biggest insult to every Arab and Muslim." </p><p>-- "Congress abdicates as Bush obfuscates" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (10/15) editorializes:  "The U.S. </p><p>Congress officially surrendered its constitutional </p><p>powers in foreign policy . granting President George </p><p>Bush wide and largely unaccountable powers to wage war </p><p>against Iraq.  The abdication by Congress runs </p><p>contrary to the intents of the founding fathers of the </p><p>United States.  Voting to support a president who has </p><p>yet to make clear his intentions or long-term strategy </p><p>violates the separation of powers, so integral to the </p><p>American constitution.  Congress\' vote to hand over </p><p>full-war-making authority to President Bush also </p><p>violates the individual responsibilities of </p><p>representatives and senators as regards their roles as </p><p>the `voices of the electorate\'.  Most polls show </p><p>Americans are lukewarm at best concerning waging war </p><p>against Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>-- "An American military ruler for Baghdad!" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/13) editorializes:  "There is no doubt that the </p><p>Iraqi issue is not about international inspectors, </p><p>weapons of mass destruction or other American pretext. </p><p>It is about occupying Iraq and appointing an American </p><p>military ruler.  One cannot believe these war </p><p>scenarios that talk about the occupation of a country </p><p>and the establishment of a foreign military government </p><p>on its soil, not when the era of colonialism is over </p><p>and the right to self-determination is a given." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
