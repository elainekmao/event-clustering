<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004256 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: MOJ OFFICIAL BLAMES "NARROW MINDED" JUDGES FOR </p><p>SUSPENSION OF TORTURE CONVICTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ANKARA 8881 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter.  Reasons 1.5(b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In pursuing why the Turkish Appeals Court has </p><p>ruled to suspend the sentences of two police convicted of </p><p>torturing a detainee in 1997, we have learned that a recent </p><p>amendment to the criminal code outlawing the suspension of </p><p>torture convictions does not apply to pre-existing cases. </p><p>However, a Justice Ministry contact blamed the ruling on </p><p>"narrow minded" judges skeptical of the GOT\'s EU-related </p><p>legal reforms.  A human rights attorney called the ruling </p><p>"outrageous" and argued the Board should have considered the </p><p>recent amendment in its decision.  Given that many jurists do </p><p>not support recent legal reforms, similar retrograde rulings </p><p>are likely to continue periodically until all pre-reform </p><p>cases have been concluded.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Suspension Ends Long Legal Battle </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Court of Appeals General Penal Board ruled June 24 </p><p>to suspend the sentences of two policemen convicted of </p><p>torturing a detainee in 1997.  In a 15-8 decision, the Board </p><p>determined that the policemen should be given "one more </p><p>chance" in light of their good behavior during the trial and </p><p>the absence of any prior criminal records.  The Board\'s </p><p>ruling, which is final, brings an end to a long, seesaw legal </p><p>battle over the sentencing of the officers.  In the initial </p><p>trial, a Bursa court convicted the policemen, Ramazan Aktas </p><p>and Turhan Sumer, and sentenced them to 10 months </p><p>imprisonment for torturing suspect Orhan Buyak in 1997 in an </p><p>effort to make him confess to a crime.  However, the court </p><p>suspended the punishment, taking into consideration "the past </p><p>behavior of the policemen and the view that they will not </p><p>commit a crime again."  An appeals court later overruled the </p><p>suspension and sent the case back to the lower court with </p><p>instructions to implement the sentences.  However, the lower </p><p>court stuck by its original decision, thereby sending the </p><p>case to the General Penal Board for a final ruling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>January Amendment Does Not Apply </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The suspension comes despite a January amendment to </p><p>the penal code revoking the authority of judges to suspend </p><p>sentences in torture cases (reftel).  Parliament did not have </p><p>the option of applying the amendment to pre-existing cases -- </p><p>under Turkish law, legal amendments that are beneficial to </p><p>defendants can be applied retroactively, but those that are </p><p>prejudicial to defendants cannot.  Since the crime in this </p><p>case was committed well before the amendment, the decision to </p><p>suspend the sentences is legal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MOJ: Judges Reject Spirit of Reforms </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a July 3 discussion with us, Justice Ministry </p><p>Director General for International Relations Abdulkadir Kaya </p><p>noted that the Board\'s decision, while it may be technically </p><p>legal, contradicts the spirit of recent EU-related amendments </p><p>and raises doubts about the depth of GOT commitment to </p><p>judicial reform.  Kaya acknowledged that judges and </p><p>prosecutors are generally skeptical of the reforms and </p><p>resentful of GOT efforts to change their practices.  The </p><p>Justice Ministry, in its training seminars on the reforms, </p><p>encourages judges and prosecutors to take into account the </p><p>latest legal amendments, even if those amendments do not </p><p>apply to the case in hand, he said.  However, Kaya said, </p><p>Ministry speakers usually get a frosty response from jurists, </p><p>who tend to sympathize with police and view advice from </p><p>Ankara as meddling.  "They say, \'We understand the reality in </p><p>small towns.  We understand the position police are in.  You </p><p>are just sitting in an office in Ankara making laws,\'" Kaya </p><p>said.  Many judges and prosecutors have a "narrow minded" </p><p>perspective, and it will take time to change their views, he </p><p>averred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Board of Judges Cannot Change Attitudes </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) Kaya rejected the suggestion that the Supreme Board of </p><p>Judges and Prosecutors should discipline jurists whose </p><p>actions contradict the spirit of judicial reform.  The role </p><p>of the Board, he asserted, is to enforce the letter of the </p><p>law.  If the Board took action against a jurist for a </p><p>decision that was technically legal, it would be </p><p>inappropriately acting as an appeals court, he argued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Attorney: Police Given Second Chance to Torture </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Yusuf Alatas, attorney and Human Rights Association </p><p>vice chairman, ridiculed the Penal Board\'s "outrageous" </p><p>decision to suspend the sentences.  "They want to give them a </p><p>second chance?  A second chance for what, to commit torture?" </p><p>he asked.  Alatas argued that the Board should have </p><p>considered the January amendment in making its decision. </p><p>Unfortunately, he averred, the judiciary over the past 20 </p><p>years has been staffed largely with "nationalists" who oppose </p><p>human rights reform, particularly among jurists appointed by </p><p>the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) during its years in </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Viewed from a distance, the suspension of the torture </p><p>sentence might appear as an anomaly in the context of an </p><p>overall trend toward GOT human rights reform.  But there has </p><p>never been consistent, uninterrupted progress on torture or </p><p>any other human rights problem in Turkey.  The reform current </p><p>has a powerful undertow.  As Justice Minister Cicek, Deputy </p><p>Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Kilic, and former Justice </p><p>Minister Celikel have bluntly told us, judges and prosecutors </p><p>are among those least supportive of the new legal amendments </p><p>and of reform in general.  Given that reforms designed to </p><p>increase punishments for certain crimes are not retroactive, </p><p>we can expect to continue to see rulings like this latest one </p><p>periodically for the next two to three years, until all the </p><p>pre-reform court cases have been cleared. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
