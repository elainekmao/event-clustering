<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001908 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, KDEM, PREL, PINR, PHUM, ASEC, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: FRG PROTEST AFTERMATH: GUATEMALA MORE FRAGMENTED </p><p>THAN EVER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Unexpected legal setbacks to the registration </p><p>of former General Rios Montt\'s presidential candidacy have </p><p>led to profound frustration among FRG leaders.  They view </p><p>Rios Montt as the only FRG candidate who has a chance of </p><p>winning the elections, and the biggest draw for voters to </p><p>support their congressional slate.  The possibility that </p><p>legal appeals could derail Rios Montt\'s candidacy led the FRG </p><p>to use violent street protests July 24-25 to send the signal </p><p>that they are prepared to raise the stakes in order to ensure </p><p>that Rios Montt can run.  Most of the opposition, which with </p><p>civil society has formed a "Civic Front for Democracy in </p><p>Guatemala," is equally determined to keep him out of the </p><p>race, although some might be willing to accept a new </p><p>Constitutional Court decision if its magistrates were </p><p>selected in a transparent manner.  Both sides are insisting </p><p>that international mediation favor their all-or-nothing </p><p>positions.  Contacts in the opposition and the police believe </p><p>violence will escalate following the next ruling of the </p><p>Supreme Court (expected in the next ten days), which is not </p><p>expected to favor Rios Montt.  OAS Election Observation </p><p>Mission chief Paniagua arrived in Guatemala on July 25. In a </p><p>meeting with the Ambassador on July 27, he seemed to have a </p><p>good grasp of the immediate crisis and, while cautious, he </p><p>did not rule out a de facto mediation role.  It will not be </p><p>an easy task.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Violent street protests on July 24-25 organized by the </p><p>FRG have raised the stakes significantly in the confrontation </p><p>between the ruling party and practically all organized </p><p>sectors of Guatemalan society, and have planted the flag that </p><p>the FRG is prepared to use violence to keep their candidate </p><p>from being disqualified in the upcoming elections.  The </p><p>highly orchestrated protests were sparked by the FRG\'s </p><p>frustration over setbacks in their legal fight to register </p><p>former General Efrain Rios Montt as their presidential </p><p>candidate.  The FRG viewed the decision by the Supreme Court </p><p>to hear an appeal to the Constitutional Court\'s decision that </p><p>Rios Montt could run not only as illegal (note: some of our </p><p>viscerally anti-FRG contacts agree that the Supreme Court\'s </p><p>challenge was at a minimum unprecedented, and probably </p><p>unconstitutional. End note), but also signaled that the </p><p>opposition could manipulate the courts to keep Rios Montt </p><p>out.  Having been deprived of the legal recourses they </p><p>thought they had secured through painstakingly packing the </p><p>Constitutional Court, the FRG leadership chose to fall back </p><p>on violence and intimidation.  Spray-painting epitaphs </p><p>against the rich and bringing the violence for the first time </p><p>to wealthy neighborhoods, the FRG has shown that they are </p><p>prepared to add class conflict to their unsteady mix of </p><p>populism. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Foreign Minister Gutierrez told the Ambassador that </p><p>the protests were organized by the FRG (despite Rios Montt\'s </p><p>public denials), and that the General had assured President </p><p>Portillo that they would be peaceful.  Gutierrez said that </p><p>Portillo and Minister of Government Reyes Calderon were </p><p>determined to keep order, but that sympathy by many police </p><p>officers with the FRG and orders for the police not to </p><p>provoke violence had led the police to not confront the </p><p>protesters.  He speculated that the images of chaos in the </p><p>streets of the capital carried by the media would scare most </p><p>Guatemalans and in the end work against the FRG in the </p><p>upcoming elections.  He argued, however, that the fight </p><p>between the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court was a </p><p>standoff, and opined that the only solution at this point is </p><p>political, not juridical.  Gutierrez suggested that only the </p><p>Ambassador, Archbishop Quezada and OAS Electoral Observation </p><p>Mission (EOM) head Paniagua have the credibility to mediate </p><p>an agreement between the parties which could resolve the </p><p>tension without further violence. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) GOG Ambassador to the U.S. Antonio Arenales and FRG </p><p>Congresswoman (and daughter of the FRG Presidential </p><p>candidate) Zury Rios told us separately on July 25 that the </p><p>only solution to the crisis is electoral, i.e. the opposition </p><p>needs to withdraw its appeals before the Supreme Court, Rios </p><p>Montt must be allowed to run for President, and let the </p><p>people decide.  Both said that the party faithful "would not </p><p>sit back with their arms crossed" if the courts do not allow </p><p>Rios Montt to run.  Both told us that on that point there is </p><p>no space for compromise.  Zury Rios said that her father is </p><p>the only candidate who can secure votes for their </p><p>congressional candidates, and that for Rios Montt to be </p><p>excluded from the elections would mean the "extinction of the </p><p>party."  She said "the party faithful" would never give up </p><p>Rios Montt\'s candidacy, and Ambassador Arenales said that the </p><p>FRG would "do what ever it takes" to ensure Rios Montt could </p><p>run.  Both echoed Foreign Minister Gutierrez\'s call for the </p><p>Ambassador to be a mediator, but it was clear their </p><p>interpretation was for us to pressure the opposition to allow </p><p>Rios Montt to become a candidate and have the matter resolved </p><p>once and for all at the ballot box. </p><p>5. (C) The Supreme Court must resolve the appeals to Rios </p><p>Montt\'s registration as a candidate by August 6.  The FRG and </p><p>the opposition expect the Court to uphold the appeals and </p><p>deny Rios Montt\'s candidacy.  The FRG would then appeal the </p><p>case again to the Constitutional Court, where the FRG has </p><p>more influence, but has no ironclad guarantee of winning. </p><p>Even if the Constitutional Court did reaffirm its decision to </p><p>allow Rios Montt to run, new appeals (not contemplated in the </p><p>Constitution, but accepted by the Supreme Court as they did </p><p>the last ones) could be filed, effectively tying up his </p><p>candidacy beyond the September 9 deadline for filing.  Chief </p><p>of Police Manchame told us that any further legal setback for </p><p>the FRG would likely lead to more violence, and that the </p><p>police is inadequately prepared to contain it.  Opposition </p><p>leaders have also told us that they view the July 24-25 </p><p>violence as only a foretaste by the FRG of greater violence </p><p>to come. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Meanwhile, the political opposition, civil society and </p><p>the private sector have been further galvanized by the events </p><p>of July 24-25 into a "Civic Front for Democracy in Guatemala" </p><p>against the FRG (Note: A similar "National Assembly" was </p><p>formed by many of the same groups and individuals in May, </p><p>1993, in opposition to the Serrano "auto-golpe." End note). </p><p>Sensing the possibility that the legal process can be used to </p><p>keep Rios Montt from becoming a candidate, there is a growing </p><p>determination to press on.  Civil Society reps told the </p><p>Ambassador that they had already engaged the Inter-American </p><p>Commission on Human Rights (which issued a statement </p><p>condemning the violence), and are seeking support for an OAS </p><p>Permanent Council session to invoke the democratic charter. </p><p>The opposition believes that the FRG\'s violent actions </p><p>greatly undermined any benefit of the doubt the international </p><p>community was prepared to extend to the ruling party, and the </p><p>opposition hopes to parlay the revulsion at the violent </p><p>protests into greater international opposition to Rios </p><p>Montt\'s candidacy.  Similarly, the FRG recognizes that the </p><p>violence of July 24-25 may have burned a bridge with the </p><p>international community, and Zury Rios told us the FRG </p><p>believes the USG has cast its lot in with GANA candidate </p><p>Oscar Berger. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) OAS Election Observation Mission (EOM) head Valentin </p><p>Paniagua arrived in Guatemala on July 25 for a visit </p><p>scheduled to last through August 4.  Foreign Minister </p><p>Gutierrez told the Ambassador he had asked Paniagua to come </p><p>straight from the airport to the MFA in order to engage him </p><p>immediately in seeking a solution to this latest crisis.  By </p><p>the time the Ambassador and A/DCM met with Paniagua on July </p><p>27, he had (through facilitators) met with three top FRG </p><p>leaders (but not Rios Montt), and seemed to have a good grasp </p><p>of the psychological dynamics and legal architecture of the </p><p>candidate registration crisis.  He was clearly unenthusiastic </p><p>about playing a formal mediation role, but did not rule a de </p><p>facto one out. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: The FRG is desperate, and, rather than </p><p>recognizing that its authoritarian style has deepened the </p><p>confrontation, believes its electoral ambitions are being </p><p>frustrated by a greedy private sector, a scheming political </p><p>opposition and an unforgiving international community. </p><p>Isolated and "misunderstood," the FRG has little to lose by </p><p>pushing the limits of electoral campaign conduct.  It is not </p><p>clear how the courts will ultimately rule in the General\'s </p><p>case or what other legal strategies the FRG may be </p><p>contemplating, but it appears certain that tensions will grow </p><p>as a compromise is not expected in the short term.  Letting </p><p>both sides stare into the abyss a little longer may be </p><p>necessary to induce a modicum of flexibility on both sides. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
