<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000593 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; EAP/PMBS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, ETRD, IZ, SN, VM, ASEAN </p><p>SUBJECT:  SINGAPORE PRIME MINISTER REAFFIRMS STRONG </p><p>--         ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong </p><p>underscored a shared determination to advance the already </p><p>strong economic ties with Vietnam.  PM Goh encouraged his </p><p>hosts to "look beyond Singapore" for future trade and </p><p>investment partners, however.  Both sides reaffirmed a </p><p>commitment to counterterrorism and Vietnam reiterated its </p><p>hope for a peaceful solution to the Iraq situation.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PM Goh Chok Tong visited Vietnam March 3-5 at the </p><p>invitation of GVN Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.  This was PM </p><p>Goh\'s third visit to Vietnam since 1994; he was last here in </p><p>1998 for the ASEAN summit.  Singapore Embassy First </p><p>Secretary Andrew Teng told poloff on March 10 that PMs Goh </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>and Khai "know each other well" from bilateral visits as </p><p>well as their attendance at various regional and </p><p>multilateral fora.  PM Goh\'s visit was the most senior from </p><p>Singapore since President S.R. Nathan visited in February </p><p>2001; President Tran Duc Luong visited Singapore in 1998. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>VISIT CONSIDERED "UNOFFICIAL" </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Although not described as such in the state- </p><p>controlled media (which reported prominently about the </p><p>visit), Teng said that the Singaporeans considered the visit </p><p>a "working, unofficial visit."  Singapore authorities only </p><p>informed the GVN "about a week" in advance, although there </p><p>had been an invitation on record for a "considerable time," </p><p>he added.  Teng suggested that PM Goh, who already had a </p><p>trip planned to Thailand, liked the idea of also adding </p><p>Vietnam.  However, PM Goh apparently preferred not to have </p><p>the "ceremonial trappings" of a full-blown state visit. </p><p>According to Teng, the GVN "was not thrilled" with the idea, </p><p>but went along with it, probably, in part, due to </p><p>Singapore\'s importance as a foreign investor.  Due to the </p><p>unofficial nature of the trip, Teng noted that there was no </p><p>large entourage of government and business officials and no </p><p>agreements were signed. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Despite the relatively short notice, PM Goh met </p><p>with Vietnam\'s three major leaders: PM Khai, President </p><p>Luong, and Communist Party of Vietnam General Secretary Nong </p><p>Duc Manh.  In addition, PM Goh also met with resident </p><p>Singapore businessmen and paid a visit to the Singapore- </p><p>sponsored training center in Hanoi. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>ECONOMICS:  VIETNAM SHOULD LOOK BEYOND SINGAPORE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  According to press reports, Singapore is the </p><p>largest foreign investor in Vietnam, totaling over USD 7.2 </p><p>billion spread over 320 projects.  Teng cautioned against </p><p>reading too much into this figure, however.  While </p><p>undoubtedly Singapore is a "major economic force in </p><p>Vietnam," probably "about 50 percent" of the foreign </p><p>investment credited to Singapore is actually third party </p><p>investment that goes through Singapore (Note:  including at </p><p>least USD 1 billion from US companies based in Singapore, </p><p>according to Embassy Hanoi\'s estimate).  Two-way trade is </p><p>also significant, having reached about USD 3.5 billion in </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  According to Teng, PM Goh told his hosts that if </p><p>Vietnam wanted to move to the next stage of economic </p><p>development, it should "actually look beyond" Singapore and </p><p>other ASEAN countries and focus its efforts on large markets </p><p>such as the European Union and the United States.  PM Goh </p><p>told the GVN leadership that while ASEAN will no doubt </p><p>remain an important market for Vietnam, the "long term </p><p>future" is in the West.  Separately, Dr. Tran Khanh, </p><p>Director of the Center for ASEAN Studies, Institute of </p><p>Southeast Asian Studies, told poloff on March 11 that this </p><p>message "is not new" to the GVN.  "Our leaders know that we </p><p>will have to look beyond ASEAN truly to compete in this era </p><p>of globalization," he added. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>SINGAPORE BUSINESS COMMUNITY:  GENERALLY UPBEAT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Teng noted that when PM Goh met with the local </p><p>Singapore business community, they were generally upbeat on </p><p>the business climate in Vietnam.  Many have been here close </p><p>to 10 years, he added, and "know their way around." </p><p>However, several suggested to PM Goh that he remind his </p><p>hosts of the need for faster economic reforms.  Some also </p><p>expressed frustration at what they termed "poor policy </p><p>coordination" among ministries involved with the business </p><p>community.  On the positive side, business leaders told PM </p><p>Goh that they believe there is good potential in Vietnam for </p><p>tourism and real estate ventures, including hotels and </p><p>residential facilities. </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>SINGAPORE TRAINING WELL RECEIVED </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  At his visit to the Singapore-sponsored training </p><p>facility in central Hanoi, PM Goh had a "lively discussion" </p><p>with the Vietnamese students.  This was his only substantial </p><p>contact with the public during the visit, Teng noted. </p><p>Nearly 400 Vietnamese students have received short-term </p><p>training at the center in a wide variety of fields.  The </p><p>center, according to Teng, can be viewed as Singapore\'s </p><p>contribution to the ongoing ASEAN effort of encouraging </p><p>wealthier nations to help the less developed.  During the </p><p>visit, PM Goh also discussed with Vietnam\'s leadership the </p><p>possibility that Singapore would sponsor more student </p><p>exchanges.  Teng said that the GVN leaders viewed this idea </p><p>positively. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUES:  NOT BILATERAL </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Teng and Khanh said separately that, while </p><p>Singapore and Vietnam have no outstanding bilateral </p><p>political issues, PM Goh and Party Secretary Manh touched on </p><p>terrorism, with Manh claiming that Vietnam is "sympathetic" </p><p>to counterterrorism needs because of its "past experience." </p><p>Teng expressed some puzzlement about Manh\'s exact meaning </p><p>but suggested that Manh might have been making an oblique </p><p>reference to past "terrorist" incidents perpetrated against </p><p>Vietnam by overseas Vietnamese.  Khanh commented that, since </p><p>terrorism is "an extremely sensitive issue in Singapore," </p><p>the leaders likely had no desire to go beyond a very limited </p><p>discussion.  Regarding Iraq, Teng said that the topic came </p><p>up in the meeting with PM Khai, who repeated the standard </p><p>GVN line about Vietnam\'s desire for a peaceful solution and </p><p>the need to work within the UN framework. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>WHAT\'S NEXT? </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Teng said that PM Goh would return to Vietnam in </p><p>2004, when Vietnam hosts the next ASEM meeting.  PM Goh also </p><p>invited PM Khai to Singapore.  Teng added that PM Khai </p><p>"happily accepted" but no dates have been fixed. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
