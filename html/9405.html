<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 003230 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/S LISA JACOBSON AND IO/EDA WINNICK AND KOTOK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR REICH AND HUGHES </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, KUNR, ABUD, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: JIU REPORT ON FAO: AN AGENDA FOR CHANGE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) ROME 02589, B) ROME 02485, C) ROME 01884 </p><p> </p><p>    1.  SUMMARY.  THE UN JOINT INSPECTION UNIT (JIU) REPORT </p><p>ON "REVIEW OF MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION IN THE FOOD </p><p>AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UN" CONTAINS A NUMBER </p><p>OF CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE AREAS </p><p>OF RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT, FIELD OFFICES AND HUMAN </p><p>RESOURCES MANAGEMENT.  WHILE REFLECTING THE MANAGEMENT </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE CURRENT DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) HAS </p><p>PUT IN PLACE, THE REPORT SHOWS THAT THE FAO STILL HAS A </p><p>WAYS TO GO IN THE AREAS IDENTIFIED.  FAO MEMBERS HAVE </p><p>WELCOMED THE REPORT AND REQUESTED THAT FAO MANAGEMENT </p><p>PREPARE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.  OF THE DG\'S RESPONSES, </p><p>HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE THE SELECTION PROCEDURE FOR </p><p>FAO FIELD REPRESENTATIVES IS THE MOST DISTURBING. </p><p>MISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE U.S. CONTINUE TO PRESS THIS </p><p>ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT DG AND WITH FUTURE CANDIDATES FOR </p><p>THE POSITION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE JIU REPORT ON "REVIEW OF MANAGEMENT AND </p><p>ADMINISTRATION IN THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION </p><p>OF THE UN" (JIU/REP/2002/8) CONTAINS A NUMBER OF </p><p>IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FAO.  THREE ARE ADDRESSED </p><p>TO THE FAO COUNCIL (SEE PARAS 9-11), AND THE REMAINDER TO </p><p>THE FAO DG. </p><p> </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FAO DG CONCENTRATE ON THREE </p><p>MAIN AREAS:  RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT, IMPROVING </p><p>MANAGEMENT OF FAO FIELD OFFICES AND REFORMING HUMAN </p><p>RESOURCES MANAGEMENT. </p><p></p><p>RESULTS BASED MANAGEMENT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE JIU RECOMMENDATION REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>FAO, SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT DG\'S FIRST TERM </p><p>(AND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF BUDGET DIRECTOR TONY WADE), </p><p>HAS COME A LONG WAY TOWARDS RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT. </p><p>NONETHELESS, THE JIU REPORT RECOMMENDED THAT THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION CONTINUE TO LINK ACTIVITIES AND OVERALL </p><p>STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.  WEAKNESSES WERE IDENTIFIED IN </p><p>MONITORING AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE PRIORITY AREAS FOR </p><p>INTERDISCIPLINARY ACTION (PAIA\'S) AND IN TRAINING IN THE </p><p>NEW PROGRAMMING PROCESSES.   THE DG\'S RESPONSE STRONGLY </p><p>SUPPORTED ADDITIONAL TRAINING (RESOURCES PERMITTING); </p><p>CONCERNING PAIA\'S, THE DG\'S RESPONSE ON PAIA\'S WAS RATHER </p><p>LUKEWARM, INDICATING SATISFACTION WITH THE CURRENT </p><p>MECHANISMS FOR MONITORING. </p><p> </p><p>FAO FIELD PRESENCE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE JIU RECOMMENDATIONS ON FIELD OFFICES HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>A NUMBER OF WEAKNESSES THAT USDEL AND OTHER MEMBERS HAVE </p><p>NOTED IN THE CURRENT FAO SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>-- REGIONAL AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES AND FAO POLICY: </p><p>REGIONAL AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES ARE "BALKANIZED:" </p><p>THEY NEVER MEET AS A GROUP AND ARE OFTEN OUTSIDE OF THE </p><p>FAO POLICY LOOP. THIS WAS NEVER CLEARER THAN IN THE </p><p>SUMMER OF 2002, DURING THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN FOOD </p><p>    EMERGENCY, WHEN FAO REGIONAL AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>SPOKE OUT IN UNCOORDINATED WAYS ON THE ISSUE OF BIOTECH- </p><p>ENGINEERED FOOD AID.  THE JIU RECOMMENDED MORE </p><p>INTERACTION -- BY VIDEO-CONFERENCING, IF NECESSARY -- </p><p>WITH FAO\'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT.  THE DG AGREED TO CONSIDER </p><p>THIS, BUT HIS OVERALL RESPONSE WAS UNENTHUSIASTIC </p><p>(ARGUING THAT BUDGETS WOULD NOT PERMIT HOLDING PERIODIC </p><p>MEETINGS OF FAO REPRESENTATIVES AND THAT VIDEO- </p><p>CONFERENCING WAS EXPENSIVE AND UNWIELDY). </p><p> </p><p>-- ACCOUNTABILITY AND MANAGEMENT IN REGIONAL OFFICES: </p><p>FAO\' DECENTRALIZATION AND DEVOLUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY TO </p><p>FAO COUNTRY OFFICES FROM FAO REGIONAL OFFICES, </p><p>IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE CURRENT DG (AND </p><p>SUPPORTED BY FAO MEMBERS) STILL NEEDS WORK.  ANECDOTAL </p><p>EVIDENCE FROM FAO STAFF MEMBERS POSTED IN THE FIELD TO </p><p>THIS EFFECT IS STRONGLY CORROBORATED IN THE JIU\'S </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY AND </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY IN FAO REGIONAL OFFICES, THE JIU </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT THE "DG URGENTLY UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00003230  001.2 OF 003 </p><p> </p><p>STRATION IN THE FOOD </p><p>AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UN" CONTAINS A NUMBER </p><p>OF CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE AREAS </p><p>OF RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT, FIELD OFFICES AND HUMAN </p><p>RESOURCES MANAGEMENT.

THE DG\'S </p><p>    RESPONSE ENDORSES THE RECOMMENDATION, WHILE NOTING THAT </p><p>PROGRESS IS ALREADY BEING MADE IN THAT DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- SELECTION OF FAO REPRESENTATIVES:  THE FAO FIELD </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES ARE CHOSEN DIRECTLY BY THE FAO DG.

THE </p><p>DG AGREED TO ESTABLISH SUCH A TASK FORCE.  IT IS OUR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SECRETARIAT\'S COMPREHENSIVE REFORM </p><p>OF PERSONNEL PRACTICES AND POLICY (AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED </p><p>TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE) WILL BE THE BASIS FOR ONGOING </p><p>WORK.  THE JIU REPORT MAKES CLEAR THAT THE JIU\'S PRIMARY </p><p>CONCERN IS TO ENSURE THAT STAFF REPRESENTATIVES ARE </p><p>INCLUDED IN THE TASK FORCE, IN ORDER TO HAVE GREATER </p><p>STAFF BUY-IN TO SUBSEQUENT PERSONNEL REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>7.

IMPROVING THE GENDER BALANCE: THE JIU RECOMMENDED </p><p>THAT FAO REVISE ITS NEPOTISM POLICY (WHICH CURRENTLY </p><p>PROHIBITS SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT) AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING </p><p>GENDER BALANCE.  FAO MEMBERS HAVE NOTED REPEATEDLY THAT </p><p>THIS REVISION IS LONG OVERDUE.
