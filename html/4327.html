<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 001473 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL AND EAP </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p>NSC FOR RAND BEERS </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p>BANGKOK FOR NAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S COUNTERNARCOTICS PROGRAM: MORE DATA, MORE </p><p>RESULTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) RANGOON 1355 </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 157297 </p><p>     C. (C) RANGOON 1415 </p><p>     D. (D) STATE 215837 </p><p> </p><p>1. In response to our request (ref D), the Government of </p><p>Burma has provided a third package of information on its </p><p>counternarcotics program.  The latest package includes an </p><p>outline of measures that the GOB has taken to implement its </p><p>new money laundering law, a list of members of the United Wa </p><p>State Army who have been arrested on narcotics during 2002 </p><p>and the names and case histories of police officers who have </p><p>been prosecuted for narcotics-related corruption during 2002. </p><p> Copies of this information have been forwarded to INL/AAE </p><p>and EAP/BCLTV.  The main points are as follows. </p><p> </p><p>Money Laundering </p><p> </p><p>2. Burma enacted its new money laundering law on June 17.  On </p><p>July 4, it established an eleven member Central Control Board </p><p>chaired by the Minister of Home Affairs to oversee </p><p>implementation of the new law.  Draft regulations for the new </p><p>law were developed in workshops conducted by the Central </p><p>Committee for Drug Abuse Control and the Attorney General\'s </p><p>office in workshops in Rangoon and Mandalay in August and </p><p>September.  In July, 35 financial investigators were trained </p><p>with assistance from the Australian Federal Police and </p><p>others, before being formed up into two financial </p><p>investigation teams.  Those teams have since begun </p><p>investigations of several specific cases on which indictments </p><p>on money laundering charges are expected within the next </p><p>thirty days.  DEA officers in Rangoon have been involved in </p><p>developing one of these cases and can corroborate Burmese </p><p>statements regarding the investigations and the GOB\'s plans </p><p>for prosecutions. </p><p> </p><p>UWSA Cases </p><p> </p><p>3. The GOB has provided a list of 18 members of the United Wa </p><p>State Army who have been arrested in 2002 on </p><p>narcotics-related charges.  The list includes the name and </p><p>address of each culprit, a summary of the case and an </p><p>indication of the sentence that was dished out.  Amounts </p><p>seized in the cases range from the very large (33 kilograms </p><p>of heroin) to the very small (190 methamphetamine tablets). </p><p>None of the arrestees appears particularly high ranking, </p><p>though recent cases included the son of a UWSA township </p><p>commander, and members of the UWSA\'s  418th and 468th </p><p>divisions.  The full list is as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-- On 10/19/02, NYI MI of Nam Kham Township, Burma was </p><p>arrested for possession of .002 kilograms of heroin.

It has now provided the names and </p><p>case details of twelve police officers who were disciplined </p><p>for narcotics related corruption in 2001 and 2002.
