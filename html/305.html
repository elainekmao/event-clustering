<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 17718 </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINS, PHUM, PGOV, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: DESERTERS REVEAL DETAILS OF THE FARC\'S BLOOD </p><p>         PURGE OF SUSPECTED INFILTRATORS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  SIX GUERRILLA DESERTERS UNFOLDED TO </p><p>JOURNALISTS AN EYE-OPENING ACCOUNT OF ATROCITIES </p><p>COMMITTED BY THE FARC LEADERSHIP AGAINST ITS TROOPS IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA RIVER VALLEY.  CARLOS ENRIQUE </p><p>CARDONA (AKA BRAULIO HERRERA), A FARC LEADER IN THE </p><p>MAGDALENA, STAGED A SERIES OF MASSACRES OF MANY OF HIS </p><p>OWN MEN WHOM HE SUSPECTED OF BEING GOVERNMENT </p><p>INFILTRATORS.  THE REAL MOTIVATION, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN THE CHAGRIN EXPERIENCED BY CARDONA AND OTHER </p><p>REGIONAL FARC LEADERS AT INCREASING DISAFFECTION AND </p><p>DESERTION WITHIN GUERRILLA RANKS.  THE INCIDENT </p><p>UNDERSCORES THE FARC\'S READINESS TO COMMIT ATROCITIES. </p><p>IT ALSO SHOWS UP AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL AS ONE-SIDEDLY </p><p>EMPHASIZING THE GOC\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD, WHILE </p><p>DOWNPLAYING GUERRILLA ATROCITIES.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>UP FOUNDER ORDERS PUNITIVE KILLINGS OF FARC TROOPS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>2.  (U)  THE SIX DESERTERS SPOKE TO JOURNALISTS FROM </p><p>THEIR RURAL HIDING PLACE IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA IN EARLY </p><p>NOVEMBER.  THE BLOOD PURGE REPORTEDLY DECIMATED SEVERAL </p><p>FARC FRONTS IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA RIVER VALLEY REGION: </p><p>AT LEAST 200 AND AS MANY AS 500 FARC GUERRILLAS MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN EXECUTED IN LATE 1988 AND EARLY 1989, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE SIX DESERTERS.  CARLOS ENRIQUE CARDONA (AKA BRAULIO </p><p>HERRERA), THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE KILLINGS, </p><p>IS A PROMINENT FARC LEADER AND A FOUNDER OF THE </p><p>PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) PARTY (IN 1985).  HE ORDERED THE </p><p>PUNITIVE KILLINGS AFTER HE FAILED IN LATE 1988 TO </p><p>RECOVER THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA RIVER VALLEY, A FARC </p><p>STRONGHOLD UNTIL THE LOCAL "SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS" DROVE </p><p>THE GUERRILLAS OUT IN 1981-82.  THE EXECUTIONS WERE </p><p>PRECEDED BY MOCK COURT MARTIALS TO GIVE A FORMAL </p><p>APPEARANCE THAT JUSTICE HAD BEEN SERVED. </p><p> </p><p>FARC SENTENCES PURGER TO DEATH, BUT THE PC SAVES HIM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>3.  (U)  THE DESERTERS SAID THAT IN MARCH 1989 THE FARC </p><p>HIGH COMMAND SENT AN INVESTIGATOR ("AYUDANTIA") TO THE </p><p>CARDONA\'S ELEVENTH FRONT IN THE MAGDALENA.  THE ENVOY </p><p>FROM THE HIGH COMMAND ENDED THE INDISCRIMINATE </p><p>EXECUTIONS.  HE THEN ORDERED CARDONA TO RELINQUISH HIS </p><p>COMMAND AND APPEAR BEFORE THE FARC\'S TOP LEADERSHIP IN </p><p>THE HILLS OF META DEPARTMENT.  IN APRIL, THE FARC\'S </p><p>SECRETARIAT TRIED AND SENTENCED CARDONA/HERRERA TO DEATH </p><p>(IN ABSENTIA) FOR HAVING FAILED TO RETAKE THE MAGDALENA </p><p>REGION.  ONE OF THE SIX DESERTERS, A FORMER ASSISTANT TO </p><p>FARC LEADERS MANUEL MARULANDA AND JACOBO ARENAS, ACCUSED </p><p>THE FARC\'S LEADERSHIP OF TRYING TO HUSH UP CARDONA\'S </p><p>ATROCITIES TO PREVENT FURTHER DEMORALIZATION AMONG FARC </p><p>TROOPS.  THE DESERTERS RELATED THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCC) WAS ABLE TO </p><p>INTERCEDE IN CARDONA\'S BEHALF AND MITIGATE HIS SENTENCE </p><p>TO ONE OF EXPULSION FROM THE FARC.  LATER THIS YEAR, THE </p><p>PCC SENT CARDONA TO MOSCOW, WHERE HE NOW RESIDES ON A </p><p>"STUDENT SCHOLARSHIP." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p>4.  (C)  THE REVELATIONS BY THE FARC DESERTERS ARE YET </p><p>ANOTHER INDICATION OF THE READINESS OF THE GUERRILLAS TO </p><p>COMMIT ATROCITIES.  THEY ALSO SUGGEST THAT SOME FARC </p><p>LEADERS ARE INSECURE AND WILLING TO RESORT TO DESPERATE </p><p>MEASURES TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THEIR TROOPS. </p><p>IRONICALLY, THE INDIVIDUAL ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THIS </p><p>ATROCITY WAS A LEADING FOUNDER OF THE UP, ONE OF THE </p><p>MORE VOCAL CRITICS OF THE GOC HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.  EVEN </p><p>MORE IRONICALLY IT WAS THE PCC, THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF </p><p>THE UP, WHICH INTERCEDED ON CARDONA\'S BEHALF AND </p><p>ASSISTED HIM TO OBTAIN SHELTER IN THE SOVIET UNION. </p><p>THIS INCIDENT ALSO UNDERSCORES THE WRONGHEADEDNESS OF </p><p>AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, WHOSE ONE-SIDED REPORT ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS IN COLOMBIA EMPHASIZES THE GOVERNMENT\'S RECORD </p><p>AND DOWNPLAYS GUERRILLA ATROCITIES SUCH AS THIS ONE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCLEAN </p><p></p></div>
