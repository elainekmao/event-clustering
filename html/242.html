C O N F I D E N T I A L- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  TUNISIA CELEBRATED THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE </p><p>CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST 7 NOVEMBER WITH FESTIVITIES </p><p>AND CEREMONIES.  TUNISIANS RESPONDED </p><p>ENTHUSIASTICALLY.  IN AN ADDRESS TO THE CHAMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES BEN ALI ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENTIAL AND </p><p>LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS WOULD BE HELD 9 APRIL AND </p><p>RECAPITULATED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S ACHIEVEMENTS OVER THE </p><p>PAST YEAR.  TOGETHER WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE </p><p>LEGAL OPPOSITION AND PROFESSIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS HE SIGNED A "NATIONAL PACT" TO SERVE AS </p><p>A UNIFYING CREDO.  FOR MOST TUNISIANS BEN ALI HAS </p><p>LIVED UP TO THE PROMISES AND EXPECTATIONS EVOKED LAST </p><p>YEAR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>7 NOVEMBER: AN OCCASION TO CELEBRATE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE 7TH OF NOVEMBER WAS THE OCCASION FOR A WIDE </p><p>RANGE OF FESTIVITIES AND CEREMONIES.  PRESIDENT ZINE </p><p>EL ABIDINE BEN ALI HAD SET THE MOOD TWO DAYS BEFORE </p><p>ISSUING A CLEMENCY THAT BENEFITED SCORES OF </p><p>PRISONERS, INCLUDING SUCH PROMINENT OPPOSITION </p><p>FIGURES AS NAJIB CHEBBI AND THE ISLAMIST ABDELFATAH </p><p>MOUROU (SEPTEL).  STREETS WERE RENAMED, CONFERENCES </p><p>HELD, AND PARADES ORGANIZED THROUGHOUT TUNISIA. </p><p>(NATIONAL TV SHOWED THE TUNSIAN CONSUL IN LIBYA </p><p>INAUGURATING A "7 NOVEMBER AVENUE" IN TRIPOLI.)  GOT </p><p>LET GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES LEAVE WORK EARLY.  UNLIKE </p><p>PAST PARADES, THE MILITARY ASPECT DID NOT DOMINATE: </p><p>NO WEAPONS WERE DISPLAYED AND NO JETS OVERFLEW THE </p><p>PROCESSIONS.  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TUNISIA\'S </p><p>HISTORY, THE LEGAL OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE ALLOWED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE PARADES:  THE YOUTH WINGS OF THE </p><p>LEGAL PARTIES HAD FLOATS.  THE MOST PROMINENT FOREIGN </p><p>DIGNITARY AT THE FESTIVITIES WAS LIBYAN COMMANDANT </p><p>KHOUILDY HUMIDI WHO STOOD AT BEN ALI\'S SIDE ON THE </p><p>VIEWING STAND.  HABIB AMMAR, THE RECENTLY FIRED </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTER, WAS ALSO PRESENT AND WAS ONE OF 12 </p><p>RECIPIENTS OF A "ORDER OF 7TH NOVEMBER RIBBON" </p><p>AWARDED BY BEN ALI THAT DAY.  DIPLOMATS WHO OBSERVED </p><p>AMMAR UP CLOSE, HOWEVER, SAID HE LOOKED DRAWN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE FESTIVITIES TWO </p><p>INDEPENDENT PAPERS ASKED BEN ALI TO TREAT 7TH </p><p>NOVEMBER AS AN ORDINARY DAY SO AS TO BREAK </p><p>DEFINITIVELY WITH THE PERSONALITY CULT OF THE </p><p>BOURGUIBA YEARS.  THIS SENTIMENT WAS NOT WIDESPREAD, </p><p>HOWEVER, AND THE THOUSANDS WHO ATTENDED THE PARADES, </p><p>FIREWORKS, ETC. WERE OBVIOUSLY ENTHUSIASTIC, ALBEIT </p><p>LESS BOISTEROUS THAN SUCH CROWDS WERE ON SIMILAR </p><p>OCCASIONS DURING THE BOURGUIBA ERA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>BEN ALI ADDRESSES CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN AN ADDRESS TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES (REF A) </p><p>THE AFTERNOON OF 7 NOVEMBER PRESIDENT BEN ALI </p><p>ANNOUNCED NEW MEASURES AND RECAPITULATED RECENT </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS.  HE ANNOUNCED THAT EARLY PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>AND GENERAL LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS WOULD BE HELD 9 </p><p>APRIL 1989.  (FYI. THIS SUPPLANTS THE ELECTIONS </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY AND NOVEMBER 1989. END FYI.) </p><p>OTHER MEASURES INCLUDE:  A SECRETARIAT OF STATE </p><p>CHARGED WITH RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS; A DRAFT LAW </p><p>ABOLISHING FORCED LABOR AS A PRISON SENTENCE; </p><p>RESTRUCTURED AND ENHANCED GOVERNORATE COUNCILS; A </p><p>COMMITTEE TO ENHANCE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY; AND A </p><p>SUPREME COUNCIL OF COMMUNICATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  BEN ALI MENTIONED THE RECENT POLITICAL REFORMS </p><p>AND THANKED THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE ARAB </p><p>ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS FOR SELECTING TUNISIA </p><p>TO HOST THE ARAB/AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTE.  HE </p><p>REITERATED GOT\'S PLAN TO ARABIZING EDUCATION AND </p><p>OUTLINED PLANS TO TACKLE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS (SEPTEL), </p><p>ESPECIALLY UNEMPLOYMENT: "OUR MAJOR CONCERN".  HE </p><p>APPEALED TO HIS FELLOW TUNISIANS TO OVERCOME THE </p><p>"WAITING ATTITUDE" AND ADMINISTRATIVE SLOWNESS AND </p><p>ASKED TRADE UNIONIST TO BREAK WITH THE NEGATIVE </p><p>PAST.  AS FOR FOREIGN POLICY, HIS GOVERNMENT ASSIGNED </p><p>PRIME IMPORTANCE TO THE MAGHREB, HAD REESTABLISHED </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S ARAB DIMENSION, AND HAD REINFORCED </p><p>LINKS WITH OTHER MUSLIM, AFRICAN, MEDITERRANEAN, AND </p><p>NON-ALIGNED STATES.  RESPECT FOR MORALITY, HE SAID, </p><p>IS BINDING ON EVERYONE.  WOMEN, BEING ROLE MODELS FOR </p><p>CHILDREN, MUST PROVE THEY ARE WORTHY OF THE RIGHTS </p><p>THAT THEY HAVE GAINED.  HE CALLED ISLAM A RELIGION OF </p><p>TOLERANCE AND TUNISIA\'S REFUGE AND ASKED THEOLOGIANS </p><p>TO GO HAND IN HAND WITH PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>THE NATIONAL PACT </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  EARLIER IN THE DAY THE LEGAL POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>AND NATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS SIGNED THE </p><p>"NATIONAL PACT" (REF B), A SORT OF NATIONAL CREDO. </p><p>THE PACT IS THE JOINT EFFORT OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM </p><p>THE LEGAL PARTIES, THE TUNISIAN TRADE UNION </p><p>FEDERATION (UGTT), THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (UTICA), </p><p>AND A SYMPATHIZER OF THE ISLAMIC TENDENCY MOVEMENT. </p><p>OF THE FOUR BROAD TOPICS THAT THE PACT DISCUSSES, THE </p><p>ONE ON "IDENTITY" IS THE MOST SPECIFIC.  IT AFFIRMS </p><p>FORCEFULLY THE NEED FOR ARABIZATION AND REITERATES </p><p>TUNISIA\'S AVERSION TO POLYGAMY AND SUPPORT FOR EQUAL </p><p>RIGHTS FOR WOMEN IN DIVORCE.  UNDER THE HEADING </p><p>"POLITICAL REGIME" THE NEED FOR RESPECTING HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND POLITICAL TOLERANCE IS RESTATED; UNDER </p><p>"DEVELOPMENT" THE PACT CALLS ON CITIZENS TO SUBMIT TO </p><p>"FISCAL DUTY", ENDORSES AN EQUITABLE SHARING OF </p><p>ECONOMIC SACRIFICES, AND ASSIGNS PRIORITY TO </p><p>AGRICULTURE. THE "FOREIGN RELATIONS" SECTION AFFIRMS </p><p>THE URGENCY OF CREATING AN ARAB MAGHREB AND TUNISIA\'S </p><p>ATTACHMENT TO NON-ALIGNMENT AND SUPPORT FOR THE UN </p><p>AND OAU. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  WHEN TUNISIANS COMPARE BEN ALI\'S RECORD WITH THE </p><p>PROMISES AND EXPECTATIONS EVOKED LAST YEAR THE </p><p>OVERWHELMING MAJORITY BELIEVE HE HAS DELIVERED.  GOT </p><p>HAS FREED HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, ENACTED </p><p>NUMEROUS POLITICAL REFORMS, AND -- PERHAPS MOST </p><p>IMPORTANTLY -- CONVINCED THE AVERAGE MAN THAT IT IS </p><p>HONEST AND COMPETENT.  SIGNIFICANTLY, THE PASSAGE IN </p><p>BEN ALI\'S SPEECH BEFORE THE CHAMBER THAT DREW THE </p><p>MOST APPLAUSE WAS THE SECTION WHERE HE SAID (ALLUDING </p><p>TO HABIB AMMAR), "NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW...THERE IS </p><p>NO ROOM FOR THE EXPLOITATIONS OF NEPOTISM AND </p><p>FAVORITISM...." </p><p> </p><p>PELLETREAU </p><p></p></div>
