<p>S E C R E T ABU DHABI 001668 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/NGA AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD AMBASSADOR LITT </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR ABRAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/7/13 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EFIN, ECON, PREL, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE EXPECTS CLOSED-DOOR "DAY AFTER" </p><p>DISCUSSION AT GCC FM MEETING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) In conversations on April 5 and April 6 with </p><p>the Ambassador, UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff LTG </p><p>Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan and MFA Minstate </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid both expected that the GCC </p><p>Foreign Ministers would broach the Iraq "day after" </p><p>issue but that there would be no public commentary </p><p>on the discussion.  As for GCC participation in any </p><p>post-conflict peacekeeping operations, Hamdan said </p><p>he expected an invitation to be extended -- either </p><p>to the Arab League or the GCC -- by an Iraqi entity, </p><p>such as the Iraqi Interim Authority.  This would be </p><p>more palatable than a USG/coalition invitation, in </p><p>his view. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Addressing overall day after concerns, Hamdan </p><p>advised that we reach out to the Iraqi tribes and </p><p>clans who would put forward their leaders to </p><p>participate in the Interim Authority.  Above all, </p><p>Hamdan emphasized that the Iraqis need to be seen as </p><p>choosing their leaders.  This cannot be a USG- </p><p>engineered process, at least not overtly.  If those </p><p>put forward are seen to have been imposed by the </p><p>USG, we will only feed further anti-American </p><p>extremism.  Hamdan recognized the need for the U.S. </p><p>to play a strong role in post-conflict security and </p><p>maintenance of the peace but noted the importance of </p><p>having a public Iraqi face to these efforts. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
