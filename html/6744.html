<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000495 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PTER, EINV, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA: ECONOMIC GULF BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH </p><p>POISED TO WIDEN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. COLOMBO 172 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>      B. 02 COLOMBO 893 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission W. Lewis Amselem.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  The economic gulf between northern and </p><p>southern Sri Lanka, formed over two decades of conflict, is </p><p>poised to widen in the coming years.  Sri Lanka, though </p><p>nominally a united nation, is in fact divided on multiple </p><p>fronts - political, military, social and economic.  Since the </p><p>formal cease-fire came into effect just over one year ago, </p><p>the economic differences between north and south have </p><p>persisted.  In the south, the economy has benefited from the </p><p>cease-fire, and the government of Sri Lanka (GSL) has </p><p>initiated ambitious economic reform plans that aim to improve </p><p>the nation\'s productivity and per capita income.  In the </p><p>north, meanwhile, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>has kept the areas it controls isolated, endangering </p><p>prospects for a peace dividend.  Continued divergence of </p><p>these two economies will increase the substantial north/south </p><p>wealth gap and lengthen the odds for peace in a united Sri </p><p>Lanka.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>One country, two systems </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) When the formal cease-fire began in February 2002, Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s economic landscape was characterized by two distinct </p><p>economic systems - one run by the LTTE in the north, and one </p><p>run by GSL in the rest of the country.  The two systems were </p><p>underpinned by radically different economic philosophies and </p><p>world-views.  As would be expected, the two systems produced </p><p>radically different results. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) During two decades of civil war, GSL succeeded in </p><p>strengthening its trading links with the global economy by </p><p>developing a range of export-oriented industries.  Thriving </p><p>tea and apparel exports centered in the south helped propel </p><p>the overall Sri Lankan economy to an average annual growth </p><p>rate of 5% in the 1990s.  Repeated LTTE terrorist attacks, </p><p>including in the heart of Colombo, did not halt the south\'s </p><p>steady rise in average living standards. In the north, by </p><p>contrast, frequent and heavy fighting ravaged the local </p><p>economy:  LTTE held areas saw very little formal economic </p><p>activity over a period of twenty years.  In 1995, GSL imposed </p><p>an economic embargo on the LTTE that further isolated and </p><p>weakened the region\'s economy.  The end result was a dramatic </p><p>difference in wealth between north and south.  A local think </p><p>tank estimated in 2001 that GDP per capita in the Western </p><p>Province (which includes greater Colombo as well as poorer </p><p>outlying areas) stood at $1400, while per capita income in </p><p>the North and North Eastern Provinces stood below $400. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) One of GSL\'s early objectives after the cease-fire </p><p>began was to re-integrate the economies of north and south. </p><p>It lifted the economic embargo on LTTE areas and re-opened </p><p>the A9 road linking Jaffna with the south.  GSL encouraged </p><p>traders to do business island-wide, in the hopes of </p><p>stimulating domestic commerce.  One year later, however, we </p><p>find that economic integration of north and south has not </p><p>materialized and the two economic systems are set to move </p><p>further apart. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>The South:  GSL prioritizes growth </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The February 2002 cease-fire had immediate and </p><p>positive benefits for the economy of the south.  In 2002 </p><p>overall economic growth will come in at around 3%, a big </p><p>improvement over the 1.3% contraction the economy experienced </p><p>in 2001.  (Note: Overall Sri Lanka growth rates are a </p><p>reasonable proxy for growth in GSL-held areas.  The Central </p><p>Bank includes estimates of economic activity in LTTE held </p><p>areas in its overall GDP figures, but the numbers from the </p><p>north are not large enough to sway significantly the </p><p>magnitude of growth measured in the rest of the island. End </p><p>Note.)  Much of the improved economic performance was due to </p><p>better crop yields, particularly in tea and paddy production. </p><p>But a cease-fire conducive to tourism and foreign investment </p><p>also played a role.  Tourist arrivals in 2002 increased by </p><p>8%, and foreign direct investment was up 35% to $230 million. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) GSL is wisely not content with 3% growth. It has </p><p>launched an ambitious plan - summarized in a policy document </p><p>called "The Future: Regaining Sri Lanka" - for achieving long </p><p>term growth rates of 8-10%.  The document begins by </p><p>acknowledging that some sectors of Sri Lanka\'s economy have </p><p>remained inefficient and uncompetitive, subsidized by more </p><p>productive sectors. It then lays out a strategy for achieving </p><p>growth targets by "removing the barriers to productivity and </p><p>putting in place review mechanisms to ensure that new </p><p>barriers do not arise." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Thus far, after 16 months in office, the United </p><p>National Front government of Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe has made solid progress toward productivity </p><p>improvements.  A new wave of privatization of state-run </p><p>enterprises has begun, with GSL having sold off full or </p><p>partial stakes in oil, telecom, mass transit and insurance. </p><p>To improve the efficiency of labor markets, GSL has enacted </p><p>legislation that gives employers more flexibility to entrench </p><p>staff when necessary. GSL has also begun to contain the </p><p>budget deficit by limiting government spending and putting in </p><p>place measures to improve revenue collection.  While </p><p>implementation of "Regaining Sri Lanka" is only in the early </p><p>stages, GSL\'s performance to date indicates it has a credible </p><p>chance of achieving the dramatic growth rates it desires. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>The North:  LTTE prioritizes control </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The sophisticated policy prescriptions of "Regaining </p><p>Sri Lanka" are a world away from the on-the-ground situation </p><p>in Sri Lanka\'s war-torn north.  The LTTE\'s plan for economic </p><p>growth - to the extent there is one - appears to be focused </p><p>on aid, not trade.  The LTTE rightly reasons that it is </p><p>easier to control aid flows than it is to control capital </p><p>flows.  It will gladly accept donor funds targeted at </p><p>reconstructing the north, because it can control how and </p><p>where the money is spent.  Opening up the north to commerce, </p><p>by contrast, would require the LTTE to sacrifice some degree </p><p>of control over the lives of the local people - one sacrifice </p><p>the LTTE is not willing to make. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In a press conference last April, LTTE leader </p><p>Velupillai Prabhakaran voiced the LTTE\'s commitment to </p><p>pursuing an open economy.  But the actions of the group </p><p>indicate just the opposite: it is building a </p><p>centrally-planned economy based on a quasi-socialist model. </p><p>The LTTE is developing a sophisticated financial system (ref </p><p>A), but that system rests entirely in its hands, without any </p><p>apparent role for the private sector.  The LTTE does permit </p><p>trade, but its prohibitive taxation system - especially its </p><p>"import duties" into the areas it controls - serve to dampen </p><p>economic activity.  The LTTE has done nothing to attract </p><p>investment from Colombo\'s blue chip corporates, much less </p><p>from foreign firms.  The Tigers have made a few patriotic </p><p>appeals to the Tamil diapsora to invest in the "Tamil </p><p>homeland," but it has shown no interest in working with GSL\'s </p><p>Board of Investment to lure capital to the north. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) To be fair, the LTTE does not have many economic </p><p>resources to work with in the north.  Even before the ethnic </p><p>conflict broke out, infrastructure in the north was much less </p><p>developed than in the south.  And mother nature has not been </p><p>as kind to the north as to the south: the land is less </p><p>fertile and incapable of producing high value crops like the </p><p>tea grown in south-central Sri Lanka.  The Wanni region where </p><p>the LTTE is based, for instance, is exactly the kind of harsh </p><p>jungle terrain you would expect to be home to an insurgency </p><p>movement.  Still, the economic policies of the LTTE since the </p><p>cease-fire have made a bad economic situation worse.  If the </p><p>LTTE continues to prioritize maintaining its own control </p><p>higher than fostering trade, it will share the poor </p><p>performance of the world\'s other centrally-planned economies. </p><p> Aid flows may provide a temporary boost to the region, but </p><p>long-term growth in living standards will not materialize. </p><p>And the gap between north and south will widen instead of </p><p>shrinking. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Comment:  Implications for peace </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The economic divisions that formed between north and </p><p>south over two decades of war have crystallized during the </p><p>past year.  Both the LTTE and GSL have settled into their </p><p>preferred economic models: in the south, a free market </p><p>economy based on trade; in the north, a centrally planned </p><p>economy based on future aid.  Unfortunately, these divergent </p><p>systems cast doubt on the future of the peace process.  If </p><p>current trends continue, the south will continue to outgrow </p><p>the north, widening the prosperity gap between the regions. </p><p>The underlying economic tensions, therefore, that helped </p><p>spawn the war will not disappear, nor will the risk of </p><p>further conflict. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Furthermore, the LTTE\'s unwillingness to open the </p><p>economy of the north to trade belies its commitment to a </p><p>federal system.  If the LTTE were truly committed to </p><p>remaining part of a united Sri Lanka, it would welcome rather </p><p>than eschew trade links with the south and the rest of the </p><p>world.  Instead, the LTTE\'s economic strategy is more </p><p>indicative of an organization intent on walling itself off in </p><p>a de facto separate state. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
