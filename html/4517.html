POLICE REPORT FAXED TO CA/OCS AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) In the police report, handed to the Ambassador by the </p><p>MFA (Ref C), the police identified the shooter.  For the most </p><p>part, the report is consistent with A/RSO\'s observations and </p><p>investigations in Mutare in the days following the Gilman </p><p>murder.  RSO learned that police inquiries have been opened </p><p>against the shooter, and against the deceased.  Howard </p><p>Gilman, the deceased\'s brother, is considering an Inquest if </p><p>a Magistrate closes his brother\'s case before trial.  It </p><p>appears the GOZ will continue to advance the allegation that </p><p>Gilman drove at roadblock officials--a claim which cannot be </p><p>independently corroborated due to a lack of eyewitnesses </p><p>other than the security officers involved.  Nonetheless we </p><p>will continue to pursue all possible leads, and press the GOZ </p><p>against the use of lethal force in such situations.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On November 21, the Embassy received a copy of the </p><p>police report concerning the death of Amcit Richard Gilman at </p><p>a roadblock near Mutare on November 11.  For the most part, </p><p>the report, the full text of which is included below, is </p><p>consistent with A/RSO\'s investigation and observation of </p><p>Gilman\'s vehicle, and the autopsy results.  However, the </p><p>reported time is approximately fifteen minutes off what </p><p>police initially reported to A/RSO in Mutare.  And, as </p><p>reported in Ref C, the deceased\'s brother said Richard </p><p>returned to the house for his passport and not vehicle </p><p>papers, which he said were in possession of police at the </p><p>roadblock.  Conoff forwarded the report to CA/OCS and AF/S on </p><p>November 22. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) RSO\'s office spoke with police in Mutare again on </p><p>November 26, and they confirmed that they had opened a Sudden </p><p>Death Docket (SDD) against the shooter, and an Attempted </p><p>Murder Docket against the deceased.  (Note: The Sudden Death </p><p>Docket is not a criminal inquiry, the Attempted Murder Docket </p><p>is.  End Note.)  These are police inquiries into the </p><p>incidents.  Once completed, these will be forwarded to a </p><p>Magistrate who will determine whether the SDD case should be </p><p>taken to trial by opening a Murder Docket (serious charge), </p><p>or a Culpable Homicide Docket (lesser charge than murder). </p><p>The Magistrate may also decide to simply close the police </p><p>Sudden Death Docket, and therefor the case.  With the </p><p>Attempted Murder Docket against the deceased, the Magistrate </p><p>will determine, via witnesses, whether the deceased attempted </p><p>to kill or harm roadblock officials.  On November 26, RSO\'s </p><p>office also spoke with the deceased\'s brother, Howard Gilman, </p><p>who said he had retained a lawyer and was considering an </p><p>Inquest into his brother\'s death if the Magistrate closed the </p><p>case without trial.  In an Inquest, the lawyer would be able </p><p>to cross-examine witnesses in a hearing at the Magistrate\'s </p><p>court concerning the events.  To the best of our knowledge, </p><p>security officers at the roadblock comprise the only </p><p>first-hand witnesses. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In a November 13 meeting with Foreign Minister, </p><p>Stanislous Mudenge, the Ambassador expressed the US </p><p>Government\'s strong desire for a full investigation, objected </p><p>to roadblock authorities using lethal force in a dispute over </p><p>vehicle documentation, and stressed the need for </p><p>clarification of procedures being used at roadblocks to avoid </p><p>future incidents (Ref D).  GOZ officials identified the </p><p>shooter in the following police report.  Authorities in </p><p>Mutare, during A/RSO\'s investigation immediately after the </p><p>shooting, declined to name any of the six officers present. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (C) In the absence of independent witnesses on the scene </p><p>at the time of the shooting, it will be difficult to divine </p><p>exactly what happened on that evening.  We anticipate that </p><p>the GOZ will continue to forward the allegation that Gilman </p><p>drove at roadblock officials--a claim for which we have no </p><p>first-hand counter evidence.  Nonetheless, we will continue </p><p>to press the GOZ for a fair and full review of the case.  We </p><p>will also stress our concern about the potential future use </p><p>of lethal force in such situations.  End Comment. </p><p>6. (U) Following is the full text of the police report: </p><p>UPDATE SUMMARY: SHOOTING INCIDENT: RICHARD GILMAN: 11 </p><p>NOVEMBER 2002 </p><p> </p><p>On Monday 11 November 2002, a border patrol team based at </p><p>C.M.E.D. Mutare along Vumba Road conducted a roadblock in the </p><p>afternoon. The purpose of the block was to search for </p><p>smuggled goods and general vehicle checks. </p><p> </p><p>Two police officers and four members of the Zimbabwe National </p><p>Army were manning the roadblock. The four Zimbabwe National </p><p>Army members were armed with AK rifles and acted as stop </p><p>groups. The team was part of the provincial border special </p><p>operations task force. </p><p> </p><p>Their purpose was to monitor and arrest border jumpers and </p><p>contrabands illegally crossing the border into and from </p><p>Zimbabwe. They also monitored issues of security interest. </p><p>The team commander was Sergeant Machingauta of Police Mutare </p><p>Rural. </p><p> </p><p>At the roadblock there were no roadblock equipment but all </p><p>officers were in uniform with the two police officers putting </p><p>on traffic sleeves. At around 1600 hours the deceased, </p><p>Richard Gilman approached the roadblock driving a vehicle </p><p>with foreign number plates, MHV 655 GP (South Africa) </p><p> </p><p>He was travelling from Vumba towards town. He stopped and was </p><p>briefed of the purpose of the roadblock. He was asked to </p><p>identify himself and he produced his American passport. He </p><p>was then asked to produce papers relating to the vehicle but </p><p>he had none. </p><p> </p><p>The team took possession of his documents and told him to </p><p>drive into town to collect the vehicle documents, i.e. </p><p>insurance and permit papers which he alleged had left at </p><p>Number 5 Glade Flat some four kilometres away. </p><p> </p><p>He returned around 1625 hours and only produced the Temporary </p><p>Import Permit (T.I.P.), which the team noted had expired on </p><p>the 28 October 2002. They demanded for the vehicle insurance </p><p>which he could not produce. He also could not explain why he </p><p>was producing an expired Temporary Issue Permit which was </p><p>date stamped 4 November 1998 (normally a T.I.P. is for 30 </p><p>days). The team having noted the above irregularities then </p><p>advised the deceased that they were going to take his vehicle </p><p>to customs for clearance. </p><p> </p><p>The deceased became hostile and uncooperative with the team. </p><p>He started to close his windows and took off at a high speed. </p><p>He drove towards the two officers who were in front of his </p><p>car who jumped off the road for safety. </p><p> </p><p>Having noticed that the deceased was driving away and had </p><p>nearly knocked down the two officers, Private SHERENI number </p><p>807687 V of the Zimbabwe National Army who was on the side of </p><p>the road fired towards the vehicle. Two bullet holes were </p><p>noted on the vehicle. One hit the left rear wheel and went </p><p>through to hit the left rear and front doors. </p><p> </p><p>The second bullet went through the rear number plate </p><p>perforating through the middle of the rear seat to the </p><p>driver\'s seat just below the headrest and possibly hitting </p><p>the driver. The bullet was found stuck on the windscreen just </p><p>above the dashboard on the extreme right. The vehicle then </p><p>stopped and officers rushed to the scene. They discovered </p><p>that the deceased had been injured and they immediately </p><p>summoned for an ambulance. (One of the members used his cell </p><p>phone). </p><p> </p><p>The shooting took place at 1630 hours as per report from the </p><p>team. </p><p> </p><p>The ambulance arrived at 1645 as per ambulance driver\'s </p><p>record. He left the scene at 1650 hours arriving at the </p><p>Seventh Avenue Surgical Unit (SASU) at 1715 hours, as per </p><p>hospital records. The ambulance blamed his delay to none </p><p>availability of a siren. He passed away at 2000 hours in the </p><p>hospital. </p><p>Soon after the evacuation of the deceased from the scene, </p><p>Sergeant Machinguta checked for valuables from his car and </p><p>recovered $150 000.00 (Zimbabwean currency and R220) (Rands) </p><p>in envelopes in the dashboard pocket. </p><p> </p><p>Addresses found on him were as follows: </p><p> </p><p>Passport Number 153964494 (American) </p><p>Number 31 Westledge Drive </p><p>Torington </p><p>CT - USA </p><p> </p><p>Number 5 Green Glade Flat </p><p>Hardy Crescent </p><p>Murambi - Mutare </p><p> </p><p>Registered owner of vehicle: </p><p> </p><p>Number MHV 655 GP </p><p>Toyota Corolla - white </p><p>Tony\'s Car Hire </p><p>Number 33 Stagemann Avenue </p><p>Terenure - Campton Park </p><p>South Africa </p><p> </p><p>His business card address: </p><p> </p><p>African Child\'s Fund in Zimbabwe with his U.S.A. address </p><p>given above, </p><p> </p><p>Same was staying with his brother Howard Gilman at Number 5 </p><p>Green Glade Flat. Information from his brother is that he was </p><p>in Zimbabwe to carry out charity business in schools. He gave </p><p>out that he had arrived two weeks ago and this was his third </p><p>time to visit Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>He indicated that Gilman had interest in children and had </p><p>donated some books worth $2 million to Chishakwe School in </p><p>Mutare. He is also said to have sponsored food to Bvumbunu </p><p>School in Mutasa District and was working on electrification </p><p>of the school. He is reported to have used about $8 million. </p><p>(This information is not yet verified). </p><p> </p><p>The two AK bullet spent cartridges and one bullet bead were </p><p>recovered. Mutare Central had opened an Attempted Murder </p><p>docket against the deceased for trying to run over the </p><p>officers. The deceased had a temporary South African resident </p><p>permit expiring on 22 January 2003. </p><p> </p><p>The body has been referred to Harare Hospital for postmortem </p><p> </p><p>Z R Police General Headquarters </p><p> </p><p>14 November 2002 </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
