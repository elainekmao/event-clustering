SUMMARY:  THE WAR IN IRAQ AND IRAQI CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN </p><p>BASRA AND HALABJA DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC </p><p>MEDIA.  AN "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL BLAMED THE IRAQI REGIME FOR THE </p><p>WAR, AND A SAME-DAY ARTICLE REPORTED UAE FEDERAL NATIONAL COUNCIL </p><p>SPEAKER AL KINDI AS SAYING THE SAME.  AN "AKHBAR AL ARAB" </p><p>EDITORIAL ASSERTED THAT THE DURATION AND INTENSITY OF THE WAR </p><p>SURPRISED AMERICAN OFFICIALS.  A "GULF NEWS" EDITORIAL COMMENTED </p><p>ON U.S. PLANS FOR A POST-WAR IRAQI GOVERNMENT AND URGED UN </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  AN "AL BAYAN" EDITORIAL CLAIMED THE WORLD IS OPPOSED </p><p>TO THE WAR.

"AL KHALEEJ" AND </p><p>"GULF TODAY" ALSO CARRIED A FULL INTERNAL PAGE OF SIMILAR </p><p>PHOTOGRAPHS. </p><p>--"HUNDREDS IRAQIS WOUNDED AND KILLED BY AMERICAN WEAPONS OF </p><p>DESTRUCTION," "DAY AND NIGHT BOMBING OF BAGHDAD AND ATTACKS ON </p><p>BASRA, TIKRIT, KHOURMAL, AND HALABJA" AND SUB HEADLINES: </p><p>"ISRAELI WEAPONS USED IN ATTACKS" AND "SHOCK AND AWE ORIGINALLY A </p><p>JEWISH IDEA WITH AN AMERICAN IMPLEMENTATION."

ABU DHABI TV\'S LIVE COVERAGE OF THE WAR CENTERS IN BAGHDAD </p><p>WITH ANALYSIS AND COMMENTARY FROM THE ABU DHABI TV NEWS CENTER. </p><p>ABU DHABI TV CONTACTS REPORT THAT ADTV\'S FOOTAGE FROM BAGHDAD AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE IS CURRENTLY USED IN OVER 160 COUNTRIES.  ABU DHABI TV </p><p>DID NOT/NOT CARRY FOOTAGE OF THE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN BASRA AND </p><p>HALABJA AS ON AL JAZEERA.  ALSO, AL JAZEERA AND ABU DHABI TV WERE </p><p>THE ONLY ARAB MEDIA TO ASK QUESTIONS TO GEN. TOMMY FRANKS DURING </p><p>HIS 3/22 PRESS BRIEFING IN DOHA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ON 3/23, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>REPORTED UAE FEDERAL NATIONAL COUNCIL (FNC) SPEAKER SAEED AL </p><p>KINDI AS SAYING "THIS SITUATION OF WAR AND INSTABILITY IN THE </p><p>WORLD WAS CREATED BY THE IRAQI REGIME WHO DID NOT RESPOND TO </p><p>SHEIKH ZAYED\'S INITIATIVE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  NOTING THE BEST SOLUTION FOR THE CURRENT CRISIS, "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... BLIND, DEAF, AND PROUD, THE RULERS OF BAGHDAD JUST IGNORE </p><p>ALL ADVICE GIVEN TO THEM BY THE DEVOTED PEOPLE OF THE ARAB </p><p>NATION.  THEY WERE WARNED THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS </p><p>COULD LEAD TO A CRISIS.  THEY WERE ALSO ASKED TO BE WISE IN ORDER </p><p>TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS, WHICH WAS A RESULT OF YEARS OF THEIR OWN </p><p>ACTIONS ... WE HOPE THEY LEAVE NOW WHILE THEY STILL HAVE THEIR </p><p>DIGNITY AND BEFORE THEY ARE FACED AND SURPRISED WITH THE </p><p>HUMILIATION OF IMPRISONMENT, WHICH AWAITS THE DEFEATED IN ANY </p><p>WAR.  WE HOPE THEY LEAVE NOW AND ABANDON THE RUINS OF THEIR </p><p>PALACES AND THE HEADQUARTERS OF THEIR STUBBORNNESS AND CRUELTY." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON THE SURPRISING DURATION AND INTENSITY OF THE </p><p>WAR, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... AMERICAN OFFICIALS CONFESSED THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A HARD </p><p>AND LONG WAR.  THIS WAS ONLY AFTER THE THIRD DAY OF WAR, WHEN </p><p>AMERICANS WERE FACED WITH A NUMBER OF SURPRISES, SUCH AS </p><p>UNANTICIPATED RESISTANCE IN SOME AREAS.  THIS INDICATES THAT THIS </p><p>WAR WILL BE LONGER AND LOSSES WILL EXCEED WASHINGTON\'S </p><p>EXPECTATIONS ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  NOTING WORLDWIDE OPPOSITION TO THE WAR, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS- </p><p>ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... WAR IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE HATED, AND WE ARABS DO NOT PREFER </p><p>IT (WAR) AS A SOLUTION TO ANY CRISIS.  WHILE WATCHING THIS </p><p>CHAPTER OF THE WAR, OUR HEARTS ARE WITH OUR PEOPLE IN IRAQ, WE </p><p>ARE ALL PRAYING TO GOD THAT THE CHILDREN, WOMEN AND MEN OF THE </p><p>LAND OF MESOPOTAMIA WILL BE SAFE.  THIS IS THE LAND OF A PATIENT </p><p>PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED MORE THAN ANY NATION IN OUR REGION HAS </p><p>EVER SUFFERED ..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  DESCRIBING THE WAR AS ILLEGITIMATE, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB </p><p>DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... IF THE U.S. SUCCEEDS IN IRAQ, FRANCE AND RUSSIA EXPECT THAT </p><p>IT WILL CREATE A NEW INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO </p><p>WITH INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY OR THAT WILL PLACE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LEGITIMACY UNDER ITS (U.S.) CONTROL.  U.S. WILL CARRY THIS (WAR) </p><p>OUT IN ORDER TO BECOME THE ONLY POWER IN THE WORLD THAT CONTROLS </p><p>ITS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DESTINY AND SECURITY.  THIS WAR IS </p><p>ILLEGITIMATE AND WAS STARTED WITHOUT SECURITY COUNCIL SUPPORT AND </p><p>AGAINST THE WILL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND ITS </p><p>CONSEQUENCES WILL DEFINITELY BE THE SAME ..." </p><p> </p><p>9.  ARGUING THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT LAID OUT A CLEAR POST- </p><p>WAR STRATEGY FOR IRAQ, DUBAI-BASED ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY "GULF </p><p>NEWS" EDITOIALIZED ON 3/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. HAS NOT FORWARDED ANY DETAILS ON ITS PLANS ONCE IT </p><p>TAKES CONTROL OF ALL IRAQI CITIES.  THIS BRINGS US TO QUESTION </p><p>THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT WILL RULE IRAQ WHEN THIS TAKES PLACE. </p><p>IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT WOULD BE A GOVERNMENT COMPRISING THE </p><p>IRAQI OPPOSITION OR WHETHER WASHINGTON WILL ASSIGN AN AMERICAN </p><p>GENERAL OR COMMANDER TO GOVERN IRAQ.  IF THE LATTER IS AMERICA\'S </p><p>INTENTION, THE EXECUTION OF THE ACTION IS WITHOUT A DOUBT AN </p><p>OCCUPATION OF THE COUNTRY RATHER THAN \'LIBERATION\' AS THE </p><p>AMERICANS HAVE CALLED IT ... THE UN IS THE ONLY BODY FULLY </p><p>CAPABLE OF OVERSEEING THE PROCESS OF REBUILDING A COUNTRY THAT </p><p>HAS BEEN TORN BY WAR AND CRIPPLED BY ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ... THE </p><p>TIME HAS COME AT LAST FOR THE ORGANIZATION TO BECOME ENGAGED IN </p><p>THE REBUILDING OF A NEW IRAQ - ONE THAT IS GOVERNED BY IRAQIS AND </p><p>CATERS TO THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
