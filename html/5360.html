<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000701 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S NATIONALIST MHP: GREY WOLF PACK SNAPS AT </p><p>LONE WOLF LEADER BAHCELI </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by PolCouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: MHP members at all levels blame party leader </p><p>Bahceli for the party\'s poor performance in Nov. 3 elections. </p><p> Meanwhile, Bahceli is reneging on his promise to step aside </p><p>and is working to secure his grip on the party, but faces </p><p>growing pressure from the MHP grassroots and "Grey Wolves" </p><p>cadres.  MHP currently is keeping its powder dry and staying </p><p>silent in the face of AK\'s overwhelming electoral victory and </p><p>high approval ratings, but could become more of a </p><p>street-level factor amid growing public anxiety and potential </p><p>street protests over Iraq.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>The Bride Gimps Along </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Reeling from defeat in the Nov. 3 national elections, </p><p>Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) officials are searching for </p><p>answers.  Our MHP contacts -- both at the local and national </p><p>levels -- blame the party\'s poor showing largely on </p><p>idiosyncratic leader Devlet Bahceli and on Bahceli\'s </p><p>hand-picked cronies in the MHP pack.  Bahceli and company </p><p>failed to deliver, they say, on MHP\'s campaign promises, </p><p>including hanging convicted PKK leader Ocalan and solving the </p><p>Islamic headscarf problem.  Moreover, Bahceli\'s bungling of </p><p>MHP\'s campaign list, which the MHP leader packed with names </p><p>unpopular among the party\'s grassroots, underscored a growing </p><p>division between the party elite yearning for mainstream </p><p>acceptance and its more unrefined and hardcore base.  MHP </p><p>member Abdullah Helvaci, mayor of Kutludugun town outside of </p><p>Ankara, told poloff Jan. 17 that Bahceli lacks the courage </p><p>and strong personality to push MHP\'s agenda.  Indulging in </p><p>classic grim MHP rhetoric, Helvaci asserted that Bahceli had </p><p>had his chance and blew it while in government:  "While </p><p>(then-sickly P.M.) Ecevit was wetting his pants, Bahceli </p><p>still acted like his bride," Helvaci exclaimed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Bahceli announced just after the elections that he </p><p>would not stand for party chairman at MHP\'s next convention. </p><p>However, our contacts universally believe that he will try to </p><p>hang on and suggest he is already hard at work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Riza Muftuoglu, a Movement intellectual and head of MHP\'s </p><p>Turkic States and Societies Association, explained to poloff </p><p>Jan. 14 that Bahceli is planning a comeback.  The MHP </p><p>administration is still in Bahceli\'s hands, he said. </p><p>Muftuoglu noted that Bahceli\'s return will exacerbate </p><p>existing tensions between the leadership group and the base; </p><p>since the elections, the number of new party membership </p><p>applications has dropped dramatically.  Muftuoglu asserted </p><p>that if Bahceli does stay, he has no choice but to appease </p><p>the party base by purging the party\'s higher ranks of yes-men. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turgut Altinok, AK Party mayor of Ankara\'s conservative, </p><p>nationalist Kecioren township (and a former MHPer), recently </p><p>"guaranteed" to us that Bahceli will not step down, a move </p><p>that he says will doom MHP in the next elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Beyond its own internal fractures, MHP must wrestle </p><p>with the threat of the populist (and anti-American) movement </p><p>on the political right of media mogul and Motorola deadbeat </p><p>Cem Uzan\'s Genc Parti and the emergence of former Interior </p><p>Minister Mehmet Agar as leader of True Path Party (DYP). </p><p>Muftuoglu asserted that Genc\'s nationalist rhetoric had </p><p>attracted some 3% of MHP\'s vote total -- enough to keep MHP </p><p>out of Parliament.  Furthermore, Muftuoglu explained, with </p><p>his deep pockets and multiple media outlets, Uzan will have </p><p>little trouble keeping himself in the headlines.  For his </p><p>part, Agar is a figure with nationalist credentials and, </p><p>according to Muftuoglu, has a considerable base of support in </p><p>rural Anatolia, where MHP -- especially at the local level -- </p><p>has been strongest.  According to Muftuoglu, Agar will be a </p><p>"serious threat" to MHP in the future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>What\'s next? </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Despite the competing currents at the higher levels of </p><p>the organization, MHP is still a party of the streets.  It is </p><p>likely to rely on its hardcore nationalists to maintain MHP\'s </p><p>contact with alienated and other disaffected voters.  How </p><p>loud they become will have direct influence on the outcome of </p><p>the next MHP congress, expected to be held in October, </p><p>according to our contacts.  More important is the effect this </p><p>internecine struggle may have on more immediate matters.  As </p><p>the GOT approaches decisions on Iraq and Cyprus, we need to </p><p>watch MHP\'s rougher elements.  With their deserved reputation </p><p>for violence, these elements will seek to make their presence </p><p>felt amid the general clamor of protest -- potentially making </p><p>street demonstrations more problematic for the authorities. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
