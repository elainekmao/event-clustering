REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  IN A MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, NEW PARLIAMENT SPEAKER EMMERSON MNANGAGWA </p><p>INITIALLY DENIED THAT HE WAS STILL A KEY PLAYER ON DRC </p><p>POLICY, BUT LATER ADMITTED THAT HE WOULD TRAVEL SOON TO </p><p>KINSHASA, AT PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S REQUEST, TO LEARN </p><p>KABILA\'S LATEST THINKING ON LUSAKA.   MNANGAGWA DESCRIBED </p><p>THE NEW PARLIAMENT AS LIVELY.  ZANU-PF AND THE MDC SHARE </p><p>A COMMON ASSESSMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT PROBLEMS BUT </p><p>DISAGREE ON PROPOSED SOLUTIONS, AND NEITHER PARTY WOULD </p><p>ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO RUSH THINGS THROUGH THE </p><p>LEGISLATIVE BODY.  MNANGAGWA SPOKE HIGHLY OF THE </p><p>USAID/SUNY-ALBANY PARLIAMENTARY REFORM PROJECT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON LAND, MNANGAGWA SAID THE GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN </p><p>FORCED TO PROCEED WITH ITS FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EFFORT </p><p>BECAUSE THE PLAN LAID OUT BY THE SEPTEMBER 1998 DONORS </p><p>CONFERENCE HAD BEEN TOO GRADUAL.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE DAMAGING IMPACT ON THE </p><p>ECONOMY, WITH FOOD SHORTAGES LIKELY, MNANGAGWA SAID THAT </p><p>WAS THE COST OF REDISTRIBUTING LAND OWNERSHIP.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE OCCURRENCE OF PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05137  01 OF 03  131415Z </p><p>INSISTED THE GOZ HAD INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENTS ACTIVELY, </p><p>BUT BLAMED THE COURTS FOR NOT PROCESSING THE CASES </p><p>EXPEDITIOUSLY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFFS, CALLED ON </p><p>NEW PARLIAMENT SPEAKER EMMERSON MNANGAGWA ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>11.  MNANGAGWA WAS JOINED BY SENIOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELATIONS OFFICER EDISON PARADZA. </p><p> </p><p>DROC </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AFTER CONGRATULATING MNANGAGWA ON HIS NEW </p><p>APPOINTMENT, THE AMBASSADOR RAISED DRC, EMPHASIZING </p><p>CONTINUING U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT PRESIDENT KABILA\'S REFUSAL </p><p>TO IMPLEMENT FULLY THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  THE UNITED STATES </p><p>HOPED ZIMBABWE COULD PREVAIL ON KABILA TO HONOR HIS </p><p>COMMITMENTS.  MNANGAGWA SAID HE WAS NO LONGER DIRECTLY </p><p>INVOLVED IN DRC POLICY, BUT PROVIDED HIS ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>WHERE THE PEACE PROCESS STOOD.  THE DRC, HE SAID, HAS </p><p>BEEN VERY HARD ON THE ISSUE OF WHERE MONUC TROOPS ARE </p><p>DEPLOYED.  THE GOZ HAS REMINDED THE CONGOLESE THEY HAVE </p><p>TO ACCEPT THE DEPLOYMENT, AND TOLD THEM THAT LOCATION OF </p><p>MONUC TROOPS SHOULD BE A MILITARY DECISION DICTATED BY </p><p>EVENTS ON THE GROUND.   MNANGAGWA THEN, LATER IN THE </p><p>MEETING, ADMITTED THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO KABILA IN LATE </p><p>AUGUST AND, AT PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S INSTRUCTION, WOULD SOON </p><p>TRAVEL TO KINSHASA TO LEARN KABILA\'S LATEST THINKING ON </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>PARLIAMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05137  01 OF 03  131415Z </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MNANGAGWA DESCRIBED THE NEW PARLIAMENT AS "VERY </p><p>LIVELY."  HE NOTED THAT HE HAD SPENT 20 YEARS IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND FELT VERY COMFORTABLE THERE.  BOTH ZANU-PF </p><p>AND THE MDC, HE THOUGHT, RESPECTED HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE. </p><p>HE CLAIMED THAT, WHEN HE IS NOT IN THE SPEAKER\'S CHAIR, </p><p>THE TWO PARTIES ARE AT EACH OTHER\'S THROATS AND THERE IS </p><p>CHAOS IN THE HOUSE.  PARLIAMENT, WHICH CONVENES TUESDAY </p><p>THROUGH THURSDAY, WILL BE IN SESSION THROUGH MID- </p><p>DECEMBER, WITH A THREE-WEEK BREAK FROM SEPTEMBER 21 TO </p><p>OCTOBER 17. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHETHER ZANU-PF AND THE MDC </p><p>WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER.  THE TWO PARTIES, </p><p>MNANGAGWA REPLIED, HAVE A COMMON PERCEPTION OF MANY </p><p>ISSUES, BUT DISAGREE ON HOW THEY SHOULD BE RESOLVED.  FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, THEY SHARE THE VIEW THAT LAND REFORM IS </p><p>NECESSARY AND THAT THE ECONOMY IS "IN THE DOLDRUMS," BUT </p><p>HAVE PROPOSED DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS.  THE DEVIL IS IN THE </p><p>DETAILS, HE SAID.  BOTH PARTIES, THOUGH, WANT </p><p>TRANSPARENCY AND WOULD NOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO RUSH </p><p>THINGS THROUGH WITHOUT ADEQUATE SCRUTINY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ASKED WHETHER HE WAS AWARE OF THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>REFORM PROJECT FUNDED BY THE USG THROUGH USAID AND </p><p>ADMINISTERED THROUGH SUNY-ALBANY, MNANGAGWA SAID HE HAD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3370 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05137  02 OF 03  131415Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /013W </p><p>                  ------------------84C574  131415Z /38 </p><p>P 131413Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7083 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 005137 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EFIN, EAGR, PINR, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH NEW PARLIAMENT SPEAKER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05137  02 OF 03  131415Z </p><p>MNANGAGWA </p><p> </p><p>THAT MORNING ATTENDED A SUNY-ALBANY WORKSHOP ON BUDGETARY </p><p>OVERSIGHT.  HE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE PROJECT AND </p><p>SAID HE INTENDED TO TALK TO SUNY-ALBANY AND USAID ABOUT </p><p>DOING EVEN MORE. </p><p> </p><p>LAND </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED SERIOUS U.S. CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE. </p><p>WE HAD BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE RECENT POLICE EVICTIONS OF </p><p>WAR VETERANS FROM SOME FARMS, BUT THE EVICTIONS HAVE NOW </p><p>STOPPED.  HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN NKOMO, MNANGAGWA </p><p>REPLIED, ORDERED POLICE TO EVICT VETERANS FROM FARMS NOT </p><p>IDENTIFIED FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION, BUT POLICE THEN </p><p>WENT BEYOND THEIR MANDATE WHEN THEY DESTROYED THE </p><p>SQUATTERS\' PROPERTY.  ONCE ALL FARMS HAVE BEEN </p><p>IDENTIFIED, WAR VETERANS WOULD BE MOVED FROM NON- </p><p>IDENTIFIED FARMS TO FARMS ON THE LIST.  ASKED WHETHER </p><p>THEY WOULD BE ASKED TO MOVE VOLUNTARILY OR WHETHER POLICE </p><p>WOULD BE INVOLVED, MNANGAGWA SAID HE DID NOT THINK FORCE </p><p>WOULD BE USED.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE QUESTION OF LAW </p><p>AND ORDER MUST BE ADDRESSED, AS SOME WAR VETERANS ARE </p><p>OCCUPYING FARMS THAT WILL NEVER BE RESETTLED AND CANNOT </p><p>BE ALLOWED TO DISTURB PRODUCTION THERE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) MNANGAGWA ADMITTED THAT THIS PLANTING SEASON WILL </p><p>BE AFFECTED BY THE RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE, SO IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR THE GOZ TO SETTLE THE LAND ISSUE AS SOON AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05137  02 OF 03  131415Z </p><p>POSSIBLE.  HE PREDICTED THAT COMMERCIAL FARMERS WOULD </p><p>KNOW WHERE THEY STAND BY NOVEMBER.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO THE </p><p>ECONOMY, WITH POSSIBLE FOOD SHORTAGES NEXT YEAR.  THERE </p><p>IS A COST TO REDRAWING THE LINES OF LAND OWNERSHIP, </p><p>MNANGAGWA SAID.   LARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION WOULD </p><p>BE HURT AND WOULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO RECOVER, BUT </p><p>STAPLE FOODS ARE PRODUCED PRIMARILY BY SMALL-SCALE AND </p><p>COMMUNAL FARMERS AND WOULD NOT BE GREATLY AFFECTED BY THE </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE UNITED STATES, THE AMBASSADOR NOTED, AGREES </p><p>THAT LAND REFORM IS NECESSARY AND WE WANT TO HELP, BUT </p><p>NOT UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS.  THE GOZ FIRST HAD TO </p><p>DEVISE A FAIR, TRANSPARENT PROCESS.  THE GOZ, MNANGAGWA </p><p>SAID SHARPLY, WOULD DETERMINE ITS OWN PLAN FOR LAND </p><p>REFORM, AND THE DONORS COULD THEN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT </p><p>TO HELP.  THE SEPTEMBER 1998 DONORS CONFERENCE HAD LAID </p><p>OUT A PROCESS THAT WAS TOO GRADUAL.  ABIDING BY THAT PLAN </p><p>WOULD HAVE KEPT LAND IN THE FOREFRONT OF POLITICAL DEBATE </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS.  THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>THEREFORE, HAD BY NECESSITY DECIDED ON A MORE EXPEDITED </p><p>APPROACH.  THE GOZ IS GETTING LAND MORE QUICKLY INTO THE </p><p>HANDS OF THOSE WHO NEED IT, THEN WILL FOCUS ON HOW TO </p><p>EMPOWER THOSE WHO ARE RESETTLED. </p><p> </p><p>PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) MNANGAGWA ACKNOWLEDGED THE OCCURRENCE OF </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE PRIOR TO THE JUNE ELECTION, BUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05137  02 OF 03  131415Z </p><p>INSISTED THAT SUCH INCIDENTS HAVE DIED DOWN.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THE SITUATION WAS SOMEWHAT CALMER, </p><p>BUT NOTED THAT WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE REPORTS OF VIOLENCE </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS.  MNANGAGWA SAID </p><p>THAT ANYONE WHO COMMITS A CRIME MUST BE BROUGHT TO </p><p>JUSTICE.  MNANGAGWA BLAMED THE COURTS FOR FAILING TO ACT </p><p>EXPEDITIOUSLY ON THE NUMEROUS CASES REFERRED TO THEM.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT 189 CASES OF PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE IN </p><p>MIDLANDS PROVINCE HAD BEEN REFERRED TO THE COURTS, AND 14 </p><p>SUSPECTS HAD BEEN CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO TERMS </p><p>RANGING FROM 6-14 MONTHS.  ASKED WHETHER ANYONE HAD BEEN </p><p>TRIED AND SENTENCED FOR THE 31 REPORTED MURDERS COMMITTED </p><p>DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN, MNANGAGWA WAS EVASIVE, ONLY </p><p>INSISTING THAT THE GOZ HAD DONE ITS JOB BY INVESTIGATING </p><p>AND TURNING OVER CASES TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT GOVERNMENT PROSECUTORS PLAY A </p><p>CRITICAL ROLE IN PUSHING CASES THROUGH THE JUDICIAL </p><p>SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>12.  (C) MNANGAGWA, A MUGABE CONFIDANT AND FORMER </p><p>MINISTER OF JUSTICE WITH A CHECKERED PAST, WAS CLEARLY </p><p>PLEASED TO BE IN HIS NEW POSITION.  HE ENJOYS THE RESPECT </p><p>OF SOME LEGISLATORS, ALTHOUGH MOST FEAR HIM.  AS REPORTED </p><p>REFTEL, HE HAS SO FAR BEEN EVEN-HANDED IN HIS RUNNING OF </p><p>THE PROCEEDINGS, AND HAS NOT ATTEMPTED TO STIFLE VIGOROUS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3371 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05137  03 OF 03  131415Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /013W </p><p>                  ------------------84C578  131415Z /38 </p><p>P 131413Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7084 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 005137 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EFIN, EAGR, PINR, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH NEW PARLIAMENT SPEAKER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05137  03 OF 03  131415Z </p><p>MNANGAGWA </p><p> </p><p>CRITICISMS OF THE GOVERNMENT BY MDC MPS.

(C)  DESPITE HIS INITIAL COY DENIALS, MNANGAGWA </p><p>REMAINS A VERY KEY PLAYER ON DRC POLICY.  WE WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH HIM ON DRC AND WILL </p><p>SEEK A READOUT AFTER HIS RETURN FROM KINSHASA. </p><p>MNANGAGWA\'S COMMENTS ON LAND REFLECT A WORRYING </p><p>DETERMINATION TO GO IT ALONE WITH THE FAST-TRACK </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EFFORT IF NECESSARY, REGARDLESS OF THE </p><p>ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES.
