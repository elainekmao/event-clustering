<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002975 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10/27/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  GEMADE PLANS TO CONTEST FOR NIGERIA\'S </p><p>PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A) 01 Abuja 2938, B) 01 Abuja 2881, </p><p>       C) 01 Abuja 2878, d) 01 Abuja 2832 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Barnabas Gemade October 28 informed </p><p>the Ambassador of his plans to run against President </p><p>Obasanjo.  The former PDP Chairman accused his </p><p>President of fostering corruption, non-performance and </p><p>heavy-handedness.  Gemade offered useful information </p><p>on the timing of the PDP primaries and its convention. </p><p>While Gemade\'s allegations cannot be dismissed, he </p><p>failed to mention that, as an insider, he had enriched </p><p>himself from corruption and lack of transparency that </p><p>he now complains about as a relative outsider and a </p><p>disappointed and wounded suitor for the PDP </p><p>Chairmanship.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Former People\'s Democratic Party Chairman </p><p>Chief Barnabas Gemade October 28 called on Ambassador </p><p>Jeter to inform the USG of his Presidential </p><p>aspirations and to invite the Ambassador to attend his </p><p>formal announcement the next day.  The Ambassador </p><p>declined the invitation, commenting that he had not </p><p>attended any other Presidential campaign announcement. </p><p>Providing some documentation on his platform, Gemade </p><p>said he understood the Ambassador had a tight schedule </p><p>but hoped  an Embassy officer might attend.  (NOTE: </p><p>None did.  End Note)  The former ruling party Chairman </p><p>was accompanied by two aides; DCM (notetaker) also sat </p><p>in. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Gemade recounted President Obasanjo\'s alleged </p><p>sins, including fostering corruption, non-performance </p><p>on issues of concern to Nigerians and heavy-handedness </p><p>in his dealings with the PDP and its leading members. </p><p>Obasanjo condoned and had full knowledge of Works and </p><p>Housing Minister Chief Tony Anenih\'s practice of using </p><p>money skimmed from road-building contracts to grease </p><p>political wheels.  Over 200 billion Naira had been </p><p>spent on road-building contracts since May of 1999, </p><p>Gemade charged, but the actual construction completed </p><p>could have been done with only   "one-tenth of that." </p><p>Anenih was so intent on getting money for Obasanjo\'s </p><p>re-election that no performance under a contract now </p><p>took place once the "mobilization fee" was paid to the </p><p>contractor and the contractor had kicked back the </p><p>agreed political pay-off.  Gemade estimated that </p><p>Anenih had skimmed at least 30 billion Naira (USD 236 </p><p>million) for Obasanjo\'s campaign and other political </p><p>purposes from contracts awarded by his Ministry. </p><p>Gemade offered that, as a former Minister of Works and </p><p>Housing, he understood how the system could be </p><p>exploited.  (Comment: By reputation, Gemade not only </p><p>understood the loopholes, he also exploited them.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Gemade charged that Obasanjo was insensitive </p><p>to  other members and elected officials in the PDP, </p><p>including Governors and National Assembly members. </p><p>Because he (Gemade) would not support the continuing </p><p>manipulation of the legislative branch and the </p><p>sequencing of party primaries in Obasanjo\'s favor, </p><p>Obasanjo had decided to replace him, Gemade averred. </p><p>Eighteen of the 21 PDP Governors had told Vice </p><p>President Atiku Abubakar, dispatched by Obasanjo to </p><p>plead for their support in ousting Gemade, that they </p><p>wanted Gemade to stay.  However, Gemade said, Atiku </p><p>had offered  Presidential support in allowing the </p><p>Governors to appoint state-level PDP chairmen in </p><p>exchange for helping  ditch Gemade.  The Governors </p><p>were won over by the  offer.  However, Gemade </p><p>asserted, everyone knew he had been running the party </p><p>well and that there was no basis for his dismissal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Gemade also claimed that "everyone" in Nigeria </p><p>could see that the Obasanjo government had not </p><p>delivered on its early promise.  If a free and fair </p><p>election were held today, the President would lose </p><p>badly.  Even in the Southwest, Obasanjo had at best </p><p>50% support, and he was doing much worse in the other </p><p>five geo-political regions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Gemade suggested that Obasanjo\'s control of </p><p>the PDP Central Working Committee might be blinding </p><p>the President to his thin support in the National </p><p>Executive Committee.  He predicted the NEC would </p><p>reject Obasanjo\'s preferred sequencing (Presidential </p><p>nomination December 6, followed by State-level and </p><p>National Assembly positions December 13, and local </p><p>government slots December 18) in favor of a bottom-up </p><p>sequence (starting with local government and finishing </p><p>with the Presidential nomination) that would take </p><p>place during January.  Obasanjo could not get the </p><p>nomination if this sequencing were employed because he </p><p>was deeply unpopular in the states and LGAs, Gemade </p><p>claimed.  By putting his office first in the series </p><p>for which nominations would be decided, Obasanjo hoped </p><p>to pre-empt his intra-party opposition and preclude </p><p>development of a grassroots consensus around any other </p><p>possible candidates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Gemade admitted that, within the PDP, Vice </p><p>President Atiku Abubakar was the strongest contender, </p><p>but the VP was not yet a candidate (Note:  The four </p><p>PDP aspirants facing Obasanjo are Senator Ike </p><p>Nwachukwu and former Senate President Chuba Okadigbo; </p><p>the Second Republic Governor of Kano State, Abubakar </p><p>Rimi; and Gemade.  End Note.).  Gemade offered that </p><p>the requirement for an aspirant to purchase a form for </p><p>5000 Naira in order to "express interest" was created </p><p>by the Obasanjo-controlled Central Working Committee </p><p>as a device to smoke out Atiku; it was not a legal or </p><p>Constitutional necessity, and Atiku\'s supporters in </p><p>the NEC would probably hand Obasanjo a defeat by </p><p>throwing out the requirement.  Moreover, he said the </p><p>spectacle of the President going to a bank to purchase </p><p>an electoral form had demeaned the Office of the </p><p>President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Most in the party wanted the primaries (really </p><p>more like caucuses) to take place during January, </p><p>starting with decisions on local government and </p><p>proceeding upward from there, Gemade stated.  There </p><p>was concern among Obasanjo\'s opponents that a section </p><p>of the PDP constitution allowing all Special </p><p>Assistants and Special Advisors to the President a </p><p>voting seat at the party\'s Presidential convention </p><p>would invite abuse by Obasanjo\'s backers.  Gemade </p><p>claimed that section had been mysteriously inserted </p><p>"by the printer."  Already, Gemade stated, there were </p><p>180 persons in such positions, and Anenih was </p><p>continuing to hand out appointment letters to </p><p>political hacks certain to support the President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) (Comment:  Gemade should not get away with </p><p>ascribing this clause to scrivener\'s error.  Most </p><p>accounts date the clause to a meeting which Gemade </p><p>chaired when he was still in the President\'s camp. </p><p>Perhaps Gemade thought it was bad enough to feel the </p><p>sting of his own machinations without having to admit </p><p>them to us now.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Comment:  The National Executive Committee is </p><p>slated to meet on Thursday, October 31.  If Gemade and </p><p>Atiku are reading the tea leaves right, Obasanjo is in </p><p>for a fright.  However, the importance of money in </p><p>Nigerian politics should not be underestimated, and, </p><p>by all accounts, Anenih has been spreading it </p><p>liberally.  The decision on how to sequence the </p><p>primaries, assuming it is definitively taken, will </p><p>give an early sense of the balance of forces in the </p><p>ruling party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Comment continued:  When speaking with us, </p><p>Gemade knew his audience.  He asserted a strong </p><p>commitment to democratic principles, claiming to be </p><p>working with other politicians to fight the scourge of </p><p>political violence.  He spoke, more in sadness than in </p><p>anger, about blandishments offered to dethrone him </p><p>from his position as PDP Chairman and asserted that it </p><p>was common knowledge that he was doing a fine job at </p><p>the helm.  He claimed he lost favor with the President </p><p>because he objected to automatic self-succession.  In </p><p>other words, Gemade said many of the right things, and </p><p>painted himself as an angel, which he is not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Comment continued: The Barnabas Gemade who </p><p>met the Ambassador, however, bore scant resemblance to </p><p>the Barnabas Gemade the Mission has known in the past. </p><p>That Gemade was an Abacha-era Minister who later led </p><p>one of the parties that the late Bola Ige </p><p>devastatingly lampooned as "five fingers of a leprous </p><p>hand."  This week\'s Barnabas Gemade said he had tried </p><p>to convince Abacha not to have each of those parties </p><p>nominate him as its standard-bearer, but the 1994-98 </p><p>version never voiced such qualms.  One Barnabas Gemade </p><p>told the Ambassador that Obasanjo was failing on the </p><p>economy and tut-tutted about deepening regional and </p><p>ethnic divisions, even as another Barnabas Gemade </p><p>works behind the scenes to reverse the privatization </p><p>of Benue Cement Company, one of the more promising </p><p>transfers of state assets to private hands.  Gemade </p><p>and other indigenes of Benue object to the company </p><p>being turned over to Aliko Dangote, a Northern </p><p>businessman who has proved his competence in the </p><p>cement industry.  Instead, Gemade and his friends want </p><p>Benue Cement given to people like...Barnabas Gemade, </p><p>someone reputed to be deeply corrupt (Refs C and D). </p><p>Gemade\'s claims that he rejects violence run at odds </p><p>to those of Benue Governor George Akume (Ref A), but </p><p>pots often call kettles black in Nigerian politics. </p><p>13.  (C) Comment continued:  Also, if Gemade lost his </p><p>post at the PDP helm for standing up to Obasanjo, that </p><p>certainly was not how things were seen at the time. </p><p>Ref B reports that Gemade was faulted for being overly </p><p>deferential to Obasanjo and for failing to carve an </p><p>identity for the party separate from the Presidency </p><p>and that Gemade actively worked to isolate and even </p><p>expel from the party those who did not toe Obasanjo\'s </p><p>line.  The Ambassador has seen the overly differential </p><p>Gemade in private and in civil meetings with Obasanjo. </p><p>Finally, Anenih may be greasing the political skids </p><p>with large sums of cash, but Gemade seems to forget </p><p>that it was Anenih and others who purchased the PDP </p><p>Chairmanship for him in order to prevent independent- </p><p>minded Sunday Awoniyi from taking the top party job. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Comment concluded:  Anenih and other </p><p>Presidency political operatives made Gemade PDP </p><p>Chairman, and he seems to forget that those who make </p><p>you can also break you.  He was dropped not for </p><p>opposing Obasanjo but for his failure to manage the </p><p>ruling party effectively -- certainly a Herculean </p><p>task.  Gemade was offered a senior Ministerial </p><p>position in exchange for departing quietly. </p><p>Overestimating his support in the party, he tried to </p><p>fight.  So he was forced into retirement.  Now </p><p>embittered, he wants to exact his pound of flesh, and </p><p>Tiv anger at the President over the October 2001 Zaki </p><p>Biam massacre guarantees Favorite Son votes for </p><p>Gemade.  This venal former boss of a government </p><p>parastatal cannot win, but he can help reduce </p><p>Obasanjo\'s chances of succeeding himself.  The Gemade </p><p>we met was simply not believable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
