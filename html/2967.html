<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000968 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Maoist Leader Calls For Talks; King Calls in </p><p>Parliament to Extend Emergency </p><p> </p><p>REFERENCE: Kathmandu 695 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  A Maoist leader sent a letter to </p><p>Nepal\'s main political parties May 14 calling for talks </p><p>with the government.  The Prime Minister\'s political </p><p>advisor called the offer a ploy to allow the insurgents to </p><p>regroup.  The opposition echoed the same sentiment, adding </p><p>that the Maoists were feeling the effects of international </p><p>pressure.  The King has called in Parliament May 23 to </p><p>consider extending the state of emergency.  A May 17 all- </p><p>party meeting to discuss an extension was inconclusive, </p><p>but reportedly security forces pushed hard to a </p><p>continuation and the PM is willing to go along.  Maoists </p><p>used the occasion of three rounds of talks in late 2001 to </p><p>regroup and plan attacks against army installations.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Ask for Talks </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Maoist leader Prachanda sent a letter to Nepal\'s </p><p>main political parties May 14 calling for talks to resolve </p><p>the ongoing conflict in Nepal.  [Post\'s translation of the </p><p>Nepali-language text follows paragraph 7.]  Prachanda\'s </p><p>message came in response to recent statements by leaders </p><p>of Nepal\'s major political parties appealing for peace </p><p>talks.  His statement emphasizes the need to take control </p><p>of Nepal\'s army away from the Royal Palace and give it to </p><p>"the people," and berates "feudal reactionary elements" </p><p>for plotting to hand the country over to a foreign power </p><p>and for requesting foreign military intervention. </p><p> </p><p>A Ploy, PM\'s Advisor Says </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s political </p><p>advisor, in meeting with Poloff, characterized the </p><p>overture as a "ploy" and said the Maoists were not </p><p>sincere.  They would only use peace talks as an </p><p>opportunity to regroup, consolidate and plan further </p><p>attacks. </p><p> </p><p>Opposition Party Also Skeptical </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Nepal\'s main opposition party, CPN-UML, was </p><p>studying the statement and had not yet decided on its </p><p>response, the UML spokesperson told us.  [Note:  The UML </p><p>felt confident of the letter\'s authenticity.]  Previous </p><p>Maoist statements were not sincere, he said, and this </p><p>might be another "ill-intentioned tactic."  Prachanda\'s </p><p>latest letter might be intended to dissuade the U.S., U.K. </p><p>and India from providing military assistance, he added. </p><p>The UML judged that the Maoists were on the defensive - </p><p>although their core force was not destroyed, they were </p><p>confined to remote areas - and now was the time to build </p><p>up Nepal\'s security forces, not to go in for talks. </p><p> </p><p>PM to Seek Extension of Emergency </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The King has called a special session of </p><p>Parliament for May 23 to consider extending the state of </p><p>emergency in effect since November 26, 2001.  The Prime </p><p>Minister called an all-party meeting at his office May 17 </p><p>to discuss the matter.  A reporter from Nepal\'s official </p><p>news agency told us that the heads of the army and police </p><p>had requested an extension, while the political parties </p><p>had argued against it.  In reply, PM Deuba reportedly said </p><p>that while personally he did not support a continued </p><p>emergency, the government should heed the security forces\' </p><p>request.  The reporter concluded that the result of the </p><p>meeting was unclear, but speculated that the government </p><p>would seek an extension. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) After the meeting, the PM\'s political advisor </p><p>told us that the government would recommend an extension. </p><p>He added that even though opposition parties might speak </p><p>out against the emergency, they would do so to cater to </p><p>their own constituencies and in fact supported an </p><p>extension.  [Note:  Reportedly the heads of the Nepali </p><p>Congress Party, UML and Rastriya Prajatantra Pakshye (RPP) </p><p>- the three largest parties - all missed the meeting due </p><p>either to prior commitments or illness.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The Maoists used last year\'s negotiations as an </p><p>opportunity to regroup and to plan the devastating attacks </p><p>against army installations in November.  Many believe - </p><p>including those in the GON - that they would likely behave </p><p>similarly should the government agree to hold talks with </p><p>them now.  Security forces apparently continue to push for </p><p>an extension of the emergency even after Parliament </p><p>enacted a new law giving them expanded powers even when an </p><p>emergency is not in effect (Reftel).  That the leaders of </p><p>the three largest political parties stayed away from the </p><p>meeting gives them some deniability and cover in the all- </p><p>too-likely event they may use the request for extension as </p><p>an opportunity for political posturing.  Ultimately, </p><p>however, Parliament looks likely to go along when they </p><p>meet late next week. </p><p> </p><p>Text of Prachanda\'s May 14 Statement </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>(U) Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) </p><p>Central Committee </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Chairman/President/General Secretary, </p><p> </p><p>Today the country is in a most serious economic, political </p><p>and cultural crisis.  On the basis of social scientific </p><p>norms and historical experience, it can undoubtedly be </p><p>said that the insufficiency of the capitalist democratic </p><p>revolution has been the main cause behind the pain and </p><p>trouble faced by Nepali society.  As long as the military </p><p>power, which is a major wing of any government, is not </p><p>placed under the control of the representatives of the </p><p>people, any democracy in any form or under any name cannot </p><p>be a long-lasting or real democracy.  Although this </p><p>scientific reality has been proven in several instances, </p><p>the tradition of negligence and [false] compromises in </p><p>Nepalese politics has been a major and serious flaw in </p><p>bringing the control of the military force from the feudal </p><p>palace to the people.  Despite many limitations, problems </p><p>and weaknesses, the armed movement of our party is an </p><p>expression of the historic need to bring the military </p><p>force ultimately under the control of the people in order </p><p>to provide self-sufficiency to the capitalist republican </p><p>revolution. </p><p> </p><p>Today the feudal elements with their traditional military </p><p>force are again trying to impose tyranny on the people by </p><p>attacking the main spirit of the achievements made through </p><p>the historic People\'s Movement of 1990.  In our analysis, </p><p>the dreadful attacks on the 1990 achievements began on the </p><p>day of the Narayanhity Palace massacre [June 1, 2001]. </p><p>All the ups and downs since then are the essential results </p><p>of that.  Looking at the drama of [last year\'s] </p><p>negotiations - which had no political alternative and no </p><p>settlement - and the mobilization of the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>against the people, we were compelled to continue the </p><p>armed struggle.  Today the feudal army is encountering </p><p>heavy losses in the battles at the real fronts due to the </p><p>dedication, bravery and sacrifice exhibited by the people </p><p>in protest of the so-called emergency and the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army.  Putting price tags on the heads of Maoist leaders </p><p>and demanding foreign military interference, the feudal </p><p>regressive elements are now busy endeavoring to give away </p><p>the country to foreign powers.  This is a dreadful attack </p><p>on the freedom and sovereignty of Nepal and the Nepalese </p><p>people.  This exercise has intensified the existing crisis </p><p>of the country to a very great extent. </p><p> </p><p>To free the country from this national crisis, the need of </p><p>a united initiative from the partner political powers of </p><p>the historic 1990 people\'s movement, now both in </p><p>parliament and outside of parliament, has increased many </p><p>times over.  Our party has been pointing seriously to this </p><p>need since the palace murder scandal.  That we have never </p><p>closed the door to talks leading to a positive political </p><p>way out is a fact not hidden to anyone.  Our party has, in </p><p>a very positive sense, welcomed the appeal by seven </p><p>political parties, including your party in the parliament, </p><p>for the resolution of the existing crisis through talks </p><p>and dialogue in a political manner.  The wish of almost </p><p>all political parties, social organizations, human rights </p><p>groups, intellectuals and the public for a peaceful </p><p>political exit has been publicized.  It is a matter of </p><p>pleasure and pride for all of us that the whole nation has </p><p>been on the side of talks and a political settlement.  It </p><p>is time now that a solid step is taken on the basis of the </p><p>people\'s current opinion.  Therefore, we are writing this </p><p>letter with the objective of maintaining uniformity in the </p><p>process of moving the country in the right direction by </p><p>freeing the country from the existing crisis through </p><p>formal and informal discussions on bilateral and </p><p>multilateral bases. </p><p> </p><p>Prachanda </p><p>President, Central Committee </p><p>Nepal Communist Part (Maoist) </p><p>May 14, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
