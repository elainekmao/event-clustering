<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000534 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/ PPC (LYNN) AND PM/B (WESTMORELAND) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MARR, MCAP, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PROGRESS TOWARD REGIONAL ARMS INVENTORY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Robert E. Copley for reason 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On February 19, Central American Foreign </p><p>Ministers ratified a model format for providing each other </p><p>with information about the composition, armaments, material </p><p>and equipment of their military and police forces.  The </p><p>measure removes another hurdle in establishing a "reasonable </p><p>balance of power" in the region--a fundamental objective of </p><p>the 1995 Framework Treaty on Democratic Security in Central </p><p>America.  The measure is also required as a confidence </p><p>building measure and will serve to shore up the Central </p><p>American Integration System (SICA), which was created by the </p><p>Framework Treaty and will oversee implementation of the </p><p>inventories.  Guatemala Foreign Minister Gutierrez said </p><p>ratification was a tough sell among some of his counterparts. </p><p> Once implemented, however, Gutierrez believes the measure </p><p>will strengthen arguments for reducing the size of the </p><p>Guatemalan military.  The Ambassador mentioned the measure </p><p>during recent consultations with SouthCom Commander General </p><p>Hill, and suggested that if the inventories appear to be </p><p>going forward, there could be a substantial USG interest in </p><p>enlisting an entity, such as the Inter-American Defense </p><p>Board, to verify them.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Foreign Ministers of Guatemala, El Salvador, </p><p>Honduras, Panama, and Nicaragua, as well as the Vice Foreign </p><p>Minister of Costa Rica and Ambassador Moises Cal of Belize </p><p>met in Panama City on February 19, inter alia, to ratify the </p><p>model format for arms inventories.  Ratification was the </p><p>major hurdle in the approval process for the arms inventories </p><p>begun in August 2001.  The model format requires disclosure </p><p>of information about the composition of naval, land, air and </p><p>security force units as well as their installations, weapons, </p><p>material and equipment.  The model format provides official </p><p>definitions for the types of weapons, vehicles, ships and </p><p>aircraft to be inventoried.  In some cases, such as </p><p>ship-borne radar, the model format requires very specific </p><p>information.  If this initiative goes forward, the resulting </p><p>disclosures among Central American neighbors could greatly </p><p>enhance mutual confidence on the isthmus.  There are </p><p>exemptions in the agreement, however, from providing any </p><p>information that by its nature is reserved in the </p><p>Constitutions of member states.  In the case of Guatemala, </p><p>Ministers of Defense routinely cite article 30 of the </p><p>Constitution when refusing to provide a wide array of </p><p>military information, even to the Guatemalan Congress. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Foreign Minister Gutierrez told the Ambassador that </p><p>ratifying the model format was very difficult and that four </p><p>of the Ministers in the meeting almost refused to sign. </p><p>Gutierrez was surprised and pleased with the positive </p><p>outcome. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: This appears to be a step forward in the </p><p>initiative of Honduran President Maduro as reported by </p><p>Ambassador Palmer and as discussed December 2002 and February </p><p>2003 during the Chiefs of Mission Conferences.  Whether or </p><p>not the Guatemalan military hides behind its Constitution, </p><p>the value of the inventories as confidence building measures </p><p>would be greatly enhanced if they could be independently </p><p>verified.  Ambassador Hamilton mentioned the model format in </p><p>discussions with Combatant Commander Hill of Southern Command </p><p>February 23, and raised the possibility that the </p><p>Inter-American Defense Board or a similar entity could verify </p><p>the inventories. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
