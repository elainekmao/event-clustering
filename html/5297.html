(U) Minister of Commerce Ngelale told the Ambassador in a </p><p>January 10 meeting that he intends to follow his predecessor </p><p>as a strong voice for sub-Saharan Africa in the WTO. He also </p><p>endorsed a constructive relationship between the United </p><p>States and Nigeria on trade issues. A Ministry of Commerce </p><p>official separately previewed Nigerian positions on current </p><p>U.S. proposals in the WTO, indicating likely support for our </p><p>TRIPs moratorium but opposition on agriculture. Minister </p><p>Ngelale also expressed disappointment that Nigeria had not </p><p>yet taken full advantage of AGOA and discussed how AGOA </p><p>legislation pending in the National Assembly might be passed. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maintaining a Strong U.S.-Nigeria Trading Relationship </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>2. (U) Minister of Commerce Precious Ngelale told Ambassador </p><p>Jeter in a January 10 meeting that he intends to be a </p><p>constructive voice for sub-Saharan Africa in the World Trade </p><p>Organization (WTO). He recognized with "pride and gratitude" </p><p>that his predecessor was such a voice. Ngelale pledged to </p><p>work within the WTO framework to ensure that developing </p><p>countries are not disadvantaged in the world trading system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Mentioning the productive relationship between the </p><p>United States and Nigeria in recent years on trade issues, </p><p>Ngelale hoped to continue working collaboratively with the </p><p>United States in this area. In particular, he desired to work </p><p>closely with Ambassador Zoellick and looked forward to </p><p>meeting Zoellick at the Mauritius AGOA forum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WTO and GON Trade Policy Formulation </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>4. (U) Only on the job for two weeks, Ngelale recognized that </p><p>he was still learning many issues, including the WTO. He was </p><p>unable to respond to the Ambassador\'s queries on specific </p><p>U.S. proposals such as our TRIPs moratorium, agricultural </p><p>proposal, and our proposal for market access for </p><p>nonagricultural goods, but he promised that Nigeria\'s </p><p>positions would be formulated in terms of the broader </p><p>national interest and not narrow vested interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Ngelale took on the Ambassador\'s suggestion that the </p><p>Ministry and Embassy establish a working-level committee to </p><p>discuss WTO issues, and on January 13, Ministry of Commerce </p><p>Deputy Director for Bilateral Trade A. T. Ogunfemi and Deputy </p><p>Director for Multilateral Trade Ibrahim Ma\'ibbi provided </p><p>Econoff with a preview of likely Nigerian positions on WTO </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Ma\'ibbi said Nigeria would not likely back the U.S. </p><p>agricultural proposal. In particular, he said Nigeria was </p><p>concerned about significant tariff liberalization on </p><p>agricultural goods because reducing tariffs on rice, for </p><p>example, would spell the immediate doom of Nigerian rice </p><p>farmers. Nigeria\'s non-oil economy, still agriculturally </p><p>based, could not absorb the many dislocated farmers quickly, </p><p>and this would hurt the Nigerian economy. Ma\'ibbi also </p><p>contended that tariff liberalization would put Nigerian food </p><p>security in a more perilous state than it currently is as a </p><p>net importer already. Ma\'ibbi added that Nigeria would likely </p><p>support efforts to limit domestic support and export subsidy </p><p>programs in developed countries, but would like to see the </p><p>door left open for developing countries to provide support </p><p>for agricultural development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) On the TRIPS moratorium, Ma\'ibbi characterized the </p><p>U.S. offer as forward leading. He expressed appreciation for </p><p>U.S. efforts to improve access to medicine for the treatment </p><p>of serious health epidemics in Nigeria. However, he was </p><p>unable to say unequivocally that Nigeria would support the </p><p>U.S. proposal. On services liberalization, he said Nigeria </p><p>would seek gradual liberalization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Ma\'ibbi emphasized that these positions were </p><p>preliminary and would have to be adopted as the national </p><p>trade policy. He went on to provide a candid assessment of </p><p>the GON weaknesses in trade policy formulation. First, </p><p>coordination was poor among agencies such as the Ministry of </p><p>Commerce, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry. </p><p>Second, the knowledge base of government officials on trade </p><p>issues within each of these Ministries was low. Third, the </p><p>Nigerian private sector generally opposed trade </p><p>liberalization out of fear of increased competition. Without </p><p>a domestic constituency for free trade, it is difficult to </p><p>secure government resources for that objective, he said. In </p><p>response to a query, Ma\'ibbi promised to provide Econoff with </p><p>suggestions on where assistance in trade capacity building </p><p>would be most effective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AGOA </p><p>---- </p><p>9. (U) Echoing the Ambassador, Ngelale also was disappointed </p><p>Nigeria has not taken full advantage of AGOA. He pointed to </p><p>two key factors limiting his country\'s participation. First, </p><p>he recognized that AGOA-consistent textile visa legislation </p><p>needed to be enacted. Under his leadership, he contended the </p><p>Ministry of Commerce would be prepared to take a more active </p><p>role in getting the National Assembly to pass the measure. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter pointed out that part of the problem was the </p><p>AGOA-related measure had been included in an omnibus customs </p><p>reform bill. The overall customs bill was facing stiff </p><p>opposition for several reasons and the AGOA measure had </p><p>become a casualty. Ambassador Jeter then suggested that the </p><p>Assembly remove AGOA textile provisions from the </p><p>comprehensive customs bill. Ngelale agreed to consider this </p><p>option and readily accepted the Ambassador\'s offer to join </p><p>him in a call on key legislators to explore it further. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The second reason for Nigeria\'s failure to take </p><p>advantage of AGOA, according to Ngelale, is that </p><p>stakeholders--in particular the private sector--do not fully </p><p>understand the advantage that AGOA gives African nations. The </p><p>Minister pledged to more actively educate the private sector </p><p>on AGOA opportunities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>11. (SBU) The constraints in trade policy formulation </p><p>described by Ma\'ibbi confirm our belief that support for U.S. </p><p>positions on trade issues will not be won in the public </p><p>arena. Rather, the cultivation of relationships with key </p><p>players such as Minister Ngelale will be vital. Fortunately, </p><p>Minister Ngelale appears favorably disposed to maintaining </p><p>close relations on trade issues. In the long-run, though, it </p><p>is clear that trade capacity building will be important to </p><p>maintaining and garnering more Nigerian support for our trade </p><p>initiatives. We intend to assess the Commerce Ministry\'s most </p><p>critical needs and recommend to Washington priority areas for </p><p>capacity building support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Meanwhile, the Economic Section will follow-up on the </p><p>Ambassador\'s proposal to establish a working-level committee </p><p>between the Embassy and the Ministry on WTO issues. We </p><p>envision this committee will meet every six weeks. With </p><p>support from our Public Affairs Section, we hope to provide </p><p>the Ministry with the background information it needs to </p><p>build its institutional capacity on WTO issues of priority to </p><p>the United States. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
