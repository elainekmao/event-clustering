<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOSCOW 05204 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, UR, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  MUTED SOVIET REACTION TO MANDELA\'S RELEASE </p><p> </p><p>1.    CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.    FOR ALL THE ATTENTION THE SOVIET MEDIA HAVE </p><p>PAID TO NELSON MANDELA\'S RELEASE FEBRUARY 12, HE </p><p>MIGHT AS WELL STILL BE IN PRISON.  "SEVEN DAYS", THE </p><p>USSR\'S MAJOR SUNDAY EVENING NEWS AND WEEK-IN-REVIEW </p><p>PROGRAM, DEVOTED ALL OF THIRTY SECONDS TO THE EVENT, </p><p>AND BURIED IT SOME FORTY MINUTES INTO THE PROGRAM -- </p><p>AFTER SUCH HIGHLIGHTS AS UPCOMING LOCAL ELECTIONS IN </p><p>SVERDLOVSK.  "PRAVDA" (FEB. 12) LIKEWISE DEVOTED </p><p>SCANT COVERAGE TO THE RELEASE, AND CARRIED ONLY A BIO </p><p>SKETCH OF MANDELA, NEXT TO THE FAMILIAR 27-YEAR OLD </p><p>PHOTO OF THE ANC LEADER WHEN HE WAS JAILED. </p><p> </p><p>3.    AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN MOSCOW FEBRUARY 12, </p><p>FIRST DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER YULIY VORONTSOV WAS </p><p>ASKED ABOUT MANDELA\'S RELEASE AND WHETHER THIS WOULD </p><p>PROMPT THE USSR TO RESTORE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA.  VORONTSOV RESPONDED THAT THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION WELCOMED MANDELA\'S RELEASE BY THE SAG.  "IT </p><p>WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HE HAD NOT BEEN IMPRISONED </p><p>FOR 27 YEARS," VORONTSOV SAID IN THE ONLY FORCEFUL </p><p>COMMENT WE HAVE HEARD ON THIS SUBJECT.  MANDELA\'S </p><p>RELEASE DID NOT YET MEAN THE SAG HAD DISMANTLED </p><p>APARTHEID, HOWEVER.  UNTIL THIS OCCURRED, THE WHOLE </p><p>CIVILIZED WORLD -- INCLUDING THE USSR -- WOULD REFUSE </p><p>TO HAVE NORMAL RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA, VORONTSOV </p><p>SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE SINCERITY OF VORONTSOV\'S COMMENTS WAS </p><p>UNDERMINED BY THE FACT THAT THE QUESTION WAS </p><p>OBVIOUSLY "PLANTED."  THE PRESS CONFERENCE HAD BEEN </p><p>CALLED TO DISCUSS AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE SUBJECT </p><p>RELATING TO THE MIDDLE EAST.  THE PERSON WHO ASKED </p><p>THE QUESTION -- RADIO MOSCOW AFRICA SERVICE OFFICIAL </p><p>ALEKSEY BATOGOV -- WAS CLEARLY BEWILDERED BY HIS </p><p>PRESENCE THERE AND EVEN ASKED AN EMBOFF IN ATTENDANCE </p><p>WHAT THE PROCEDURE WAS FOR POSING QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IF THIS RELATIVE LACK OF ATTENTION TO AN </p><p>HISTORIC EVENT HAS SURPRISED US, IT HAS NO DOUBT </p><p>INFURIATED SOME AFRICAN DIPLOMATS.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>THIS TREATMENT CONFIRMS THE LOW PRIORITY WHICH </p><p>AFRICAN AFFAIRS OCCUPIES IN A SOVIET SOCIETY WHICH IS </p><p>ABSORBED IN DOMESTIC ISSUES.  MATLOCK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
