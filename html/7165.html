<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000588 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 04-07-13 </p><p>TAGS: CE, MV, AGMT, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 54  (04-07-03) </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  MEETING THE PRESIDENT -- AND HER BROTHER </p><p>-          LOCAL REACTION RE IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>MEETING THE PRESIDENT -- AND HER BROTHER </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>1.  (C) Please see Colombo 587, which reviews the </p><p>Ambassador\'s April 5 meeting with President Kumaratunga. </p><p>(Note:  By the way, CBK is slated to be in Chennai and </p><p>New Delhi for four days.  She has meetings with top GoI </p><p>and opposition figures, including Sonia Gandhi and </p><p>Jayalalitha.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador also met with Anura Bandaranaike, </p><p>her brother and a senior PA MP, on April 7.  Bandaranaike </p><p>was in a relatively jovial mood and was more cogent than </p><p>his sis.  Re cohabitation, he thought it was working to </p><p>some extent, but that a lot of tension remained between </p><p>the president and the PM (no argument from us in that </p><p>point!).  He really did not see any possibility of the </p><p>two sides\' (PA and UNP) working together given all of the </p><p>stresses.  As we have reported, Bandaranaike was strongly </p><p>in favor of the PA\'s working out a deal with the JVP. </p><p>Like other PA\'ers we have met, he thought the party could </p><p>easily subsume the JVP, just as it had other left wing </p><p>parties in the past.  He admitted that the road to a </p><p>formal PA/JVP alliance seemed to be getting a bit </p><p>difficult, as the JVP had not yet agreed to the PA\'s </p><p>plans re federalism as encapsulated in CBK\'s 2000 </p><p>devolution plan.  That said, Bandaranaike predicted a </p><p>deal could be done by June (a bit later than we had heard </p><p>before).  If there was a deal, he did not think a snap </p><p>election was immediately forthcoming, but he predicted </p><p>one by next year.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>LOCAL REACTION RE IRAQ </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) Local reaction re Iraq is real, real quiet. </p><p>The papers have lots of coverage re the dramatic events </p><p>re Baghdad, but editorials are moving on to other local </p><p>subjects like the death penalty and whether a peace </p><p>process referendum is necessary.  As we reported to you, </p><p>demonstrations in SL on Friday, April 4, were very, very </p><p>small. We have heard no reports of future rallies at this </p><p>point.  When asked about Iraq, Anura Bandaranaike (see </p><p>above) waved his hand, indicating that he preferred to </p><p>talk about other, more relevant (and less contentious) </p><p>subjects.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
