<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 004592 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE AND PA </p><p>USVIENNA FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p>USIA FOR EEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: HR, BK, SR, PREL, PHUM, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE ART OF EDITING:  CROATIAN TELEVISION FAILS </p><p>TO MENTION AMBASSADOR\'S CRITICISM OF BLASKIC PROMOTION </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  04592  161635Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  ALTHOUGH THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL\'S INDICTMENT OF SIX </p><p>BOSNIAN CROATS WAS NOT BIG NEWS IN THIS COUNTRY, THE </p><p>NAMING OF ONE OF THEM, TIHOMIR BLASKIC, THE NEXT DAY TO </p><p>A HIGH POSITION IN THE CROATIAN ARMY WAS.  BY DAY THREE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE CROATIAN MEDIA -- THANKS, NO DOUBT, TO THE </p><p>HIDDEN HAND OF POLITICAL CONTROL EXERCISED OVER IT -- </p><p>LOST INTEREST IN THE STORY.  IN FACT, CROATIAN </p><p>TELEVISION, TO WHOM PRESIDENT TUDJMAN FIRST FAXED WORD </p><p>OF BLASKIC\'S NOMINATION, FAILED EVEN TO MENTION THAT </p><p>AMBASSADOR GAILBRAITH HAD PUBLICLY CRITICIZED THIS MOVE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEIR CAMERAS WERE PRESENT AND THEY REPORTED </p><p>EXTENSIVELY ON OTHER REMARKS HE MADE AT THE SAME TIME. </p><p> </p><p>DEMONSTRABLY OUTSPOKEN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2.  ON NOVEMBER 15, AS THEY DO MOST DAYS, THE "MOTHERS </p><p>OF VUKOVAR" GATHERED IN THE PARK ACROSS THE STREET FROM </p><p>THE EMBASSY BETWEEN NOON AND ONE O\'CLOCK.  DRESSED IN </p><p>BLACK, THEY STAND BEHIND PICTURES OF THEIR SONS, WHO </p><p>HAVE BEEN BEEN MISSING SINCE 1991.  SOME HOLD PLACARDS </p><p>ALOFT, REMINDING THOSE IN DAYTON NOT TO FORGET THE </p><p>MISSING IN VUKOVAR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON NOVEMBER 15, AS HE DOES MOST DAYS, AMBASSADOR </p><p>GALBRAITH STROLLED OVER TO TALK TO THE THEM.  THIS TIME, </p><p>UNLIKE MOST DAYS, IN ADDITION TO THE DEMONSTRATORS AND </p><p>THE USUAL KNOT OF CURIOUS ONLOOKERS A LARGE GROUP OF </p><p>REPORTERS, FROM BOTH THE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MEDIA, HAD </p><p>GATHERED.  THEY PEPPERED THE AMBASSADOR WITH QUESTIONS </p><p>ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE DAY -- THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  04592  161635Z </p><p>REACTION TO BLASKIC\'S NEW POSITION.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>GALBRAITH REPLIED BY REITERATING THE LONG-STANDING </p><p>AMERICAN POSITION -- THAT (TO QUOTE THE CROATIAN NEWS </p><p>AGENCY ACCOUNT) THE "CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS STATED THAT </p><p>IT WILL COOPERATE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR </p><p>WAR CRIMES COMMITTED IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.  WE EXPECT </p><p>THAT IT WILL DO SO." THE CROATIAN NEWS AGENCY\'S SHORT </p><p>REPORT ALSO QUOTED THE AMBASSADOR AS SAYING:  "BLASKIC </p><p>AND KORDIC WERE INDICTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES </p><p>TRIBUNAL, AND ALL COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, IN THIS CASE </p><p>CROATIA AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO </p><p>ARREST AND EXTRADITE THEM. . . . COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL WILL BE ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THAT </p><p>WILL DETERMINE OUR RELATIONS WITH THE STATES OF THIS </p><p>REGION." </p><p> </p><p>NOT THE TOP OF THE NEWS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>4.  MOST NATIONAL DAILIES CARRIED THIS REPORT, THOUGH </p><p>THEY HARDLY PLAYED IT PROMINENTLY.  IT TENDED TO BE A </p><p>VERY SHORT SIDE BAR TO A LARGER STORY ON THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S REMARKS TO THE MOTHERS OF VUKOVAR. </p><p>CROATIAN TELEVISION, HOWEVER, TOOK THIS TO ITS LOGICAL </p><p>EXTREME.  ALTHOUGH IT SHOWED A PICTURE OF THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ACTUALLY MAKING HIS STATEMENTS ABOUT BLASKIC AND KORDIC </p><p>ON THE MAIN EVENING NEWS, THE REPORTER\'S VOICE-OVER </p><p>MENTIONED NOT ONE WORD ABOUT THIS PART OF HIS REMARKS, </p><p>BUT INSTEAD DEVOTED SEVERAL MINUTES TO AN ACCOUNT OF THE </p><p>STATEMENTS THE AMBASSADOR MADE TO THE MOTHERS ABOUT THE </p><p>NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MISSING. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  04592  161635Z </p><p>5.  THIS INTERESTING EXERCISE IN NEWS JUDGMENT WAS </p><p>ESPECIALLY IRONIC BECAUSE CROATIAN TELEVISION WAS THE </p><p>FIRST IN THIS COUNTRY TO RECEIVE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>BLASKIC\'S NEW POSITION, BEFORE EVEN THE PRESIDENCY </p><p>ITSELF.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT, WHICH WAS PICTURED ON THE </p><p>NEWS ON THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 13, HAD BEEN FAXED </p><p>DIRECTLY FROM DAYTON; APPARENTLY DONE ON AN AMERICAN </p><p>WORD-PROCESSOR, THE NECESSARY CROATIAN DIACRITICAL </p><p>MARKINGS HAD BEEN PENCILLED IN BY HAND.  SOMEONE HAD </p><p>OVIOUSLY CHOSEN TO SACRIFICE GOOD FORM FOR GRE </p><p>AT SPEED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SARAJEVO MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>FINN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
