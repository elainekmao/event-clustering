<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000891 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SEPT FOR INR/R, R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA, SA/PD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: Media Reaction: Nepal\'s Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba\'s visit to U.S.; French Presidential elections </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  " Deuba\'s US, UK trip" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, "Kathmandu Post" (E/D, 5/7): "...Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba\'s trip to the United States of America and the </p><p>United Kingdom has come at a crucial time when Nepal needs </p><p>international support for its development initiatives and </p><p>security.  The serious attention that Deuba\'s trip has drawn in </p><p>those countries shows that both are concerned about Nepal\'s </p><p>situation and needs.  But the absence of a consensus on foreign </p><p>policy matters among various political parties has quite often </p><p>sent a wrong signal abroad and has even confused donors..." </p><p> </p><p>"Nepal\'s campaign against the Maoist violence has, no doubt, </p><p>attracted international concern and support.  But the support will </p><p>not be a blanket one.  Alleged violation of human rights by the </p><p>government will be raised in international fora as human rights </p><p>record of a particular country affects aid disbursements and other </p><p>concessions.  If Deuba succeeds in securing international support </p><p>to keep up the ongoing campaign against terrorism and help to </p><p>rebuild the ravaged infrastructure, that will be considered a </p><p>major achievement." </p><p> </p><p>2.  "A Significant Meeting" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, Rising Nepal (E/D, 5/7): "...It is an opportunity for </p><p>Nepal to...exchange views on a number of pertinent issues in the </p><p>backdrop of Nepal\'s fight against terrorism... The US on its part </p><p>has agreed to support and cooperate with Nepal in its bid to </p><p>contain the terrorists... The meeting in Washington D.C...with </p><p>Secretary of State Colin Powell is viewed with optimism and in the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>interest of the country... The desire of the USA to see peace </p><p>prevail in Nepal speaks for the concern that it has for the </p><p>overall welfare of this country... That Mr. Deuba\'s talks with </p><p>President Bush will end on a bright note is a foregone </p><p>conclusion." </p><p> </p><p>3.  "On the French Front" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, Himalayan Times (E/D, 5/7): "The re-election of </p><p>President Jacques Chirac for a second term will probably go down </p><p>in the French annals as a political event of great significance </p><p>for the Republic and the European Union... France, though quite </p><p>safe now from a far-right backlash, is certainly not out of the </p><p>woods.  During his renewed tenure, President Chirac must </p><p>demonstrate to the French public that he is not only committed to </p><p>but also capable of cleansing his administration... The second </p><p>term...is not going to be an easy one, given the discontent that </p><p>has come to grip the French psyche over the last few years... The </p><p>popular verdict was clear against Le Pen whose racist and anti- </p><p>Semitic postures drew criticism from across the political </p><p>spectrum.  This year\'s presidential contest was, therefore, a </p><p>blessing in disguise for the French people.  They united against </p><p>what could very well have grievously hurt their reputation around </p><p>the world." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
