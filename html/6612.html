(U) PolOff attended the official launch of the Consortium </p><p>for Southern African Famine Emergency (C-SAFE) project by </p><p>CARE International in Lower Gweru, Midlands province on March </p><p>13.  Food distributions are occurring just in time, as </p><p>several people had collapsed in the weeks preceding CARE </p><p>distributions.  In addition, at least 20 people have also </p><p>died due to AIDS-related illnesses over the last few weeks. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Lower Gweru Food Just in Time </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>2.  (U) PolOff attended the official launch of the Consortium </p><p>for Southern African Famine Emergency (C-SAFE) project by </p><p>CARE International in Lower Gweru, Midlands province on March </p><p>13.  C-SAFE is a regional food assistance program to </p><p>Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi involving CARE International, </p><p>World Vision, and Catholic Relief Services.  The Zimbabwe </p><p>program targets 664,746 beneficiaries in seven districts. </p><p>CARE is working in Gweru and Chirumhanzu in Midlands province </p><p>and Gutu in Masvingo province. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) PolOff spoke with a Gweru-based field officer about </p><p>the situation in Gweru.  The field officer, who began working </p><p>with CARE in January, said this was the first time CARE would </p><p>be distributing all three commodities--10-kg whole-kernel </p><p>corn, 1.8 kg beans, and 600 ml vegetable oil--to </p><p>beneficiaries.  This was the third distribution for the ward. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The field officer told PolOff that he could see the </p><p>difference in the community.  He said prior to the February </p><p>distribution, which was  actually distributed the week of </p><p>March 3, people had been fainting and children were not </p><p>attending school regularly because of hunger.  The field </p><p>officer and Stephen Gwynne-Vaughn, the Assistant Country </p><p>Director, said they distributed the February rations late </p><p>because of problems getting commodities across the South </p><p>African/Zimbabwe border at Beitbridge.  Both said they got to </p><p>Lower Gweru just in time. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Crops in the region were in very poor condition. </p><p>Corn stalks were either dried out or appeared severely </p><p>stunted.  MDC MP for Gweru Rural, Renson Gasela, told PolOff </p><p>that the people in his constituency would harvest little if </p><p>anything and will need food assistance until this time next </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The field officer said that, overall, compilation of </p><p>the beneficiary list went well except that people who lived </p><p>in growth points were denied access to relief food, as were </p><p>people with formal sector employment.  People living near </p><p>growth points were classified as living in an urban area and </p><p>were declared ineligible for food aid.  The field officer </p><p>thought this ridiculous because the people living in the </p><p>growth points are no better off than their neighbors in the </p><p>more rural areas.  (Note: A growth point is a collection of </p><p>permanent commercial structures in a rural area. The growth </p><p>point often includes a grocery store, barbershop/beauty </p><p>salon, butcher, and a bottle store.  People living in and </p><p>around the growth point may also have piped water and </p><p>electricity.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The field officer complained to PolOff that even </p><p>though he and his colleagues helped distribute hundreds of </p><p>tons of corn, they do not have any corn from which to make </p><p>sadza, the staple cornmeal mush eaten daily.  He said he and </p><p>his colleagues had complained to CARE about their plight, </p><p>asking for assistance in procuring corn, but were informed </p><p>that they were ineligible to receive CARE food.  The field </p><p>officer also said their long work hours made it difficult for </p><p>them to shop. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>AIDS Taking Its Toll </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>8.  (U) During the drive to the distribution site, PolOff </p><p>noticed at least a score of new graves in the Gweru cemetery. </p><p> The field officer mentioned there had been more than 20 </p><p>deaths over the last two weeks.  He thought they were most </p><p>likely due to AIDS-related illnesses.  He commented that the </p><p>cemeteries could not keep up with demand and that funeral </p><p>services were on a 30-40 minute schedule to accommodate all </p><p>mourners. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Mugabe Capitalizes on C-SAFE Launch </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>9.  (U) The official ceremony consisted of skits and songs by </p><p>the primary and secondary school children and women and of </p><p>speeches by local government officials (the CARE field </p><p>officer told PolOff that the District Administrator recently </p><p>ensured that the government\'s Grain Marketing Board (GMB) </p><p>food was reserved for teachers and nurses), headmen, chiefs, </p><p>CARE representatives, and Governor Msipa.  The skits focused </p><p>on the registration process while the songs thanked CARE and </p><p>C-SAFE for coming to the community\'s aid and described how </p><p>life had been before C-SAFE/CARE.  (Note: Governor Msipa </p><p>translated the skits and songs.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Governor Msipa,s speech began as an apolitical </p><p>oratory but then became somewhat political.  He began by </p><p>thanking CARE and C-SAFE for assisting the people of Gweru. </p><p>He stressed that distribution should be apolitical and that </p><p>people who receive CARE food should not also receive GMB </p><p>food.  He also urged CARE to address the complaints of the </p><p>wage earners who were ineligible for aid but could not find </p><p>food to purchase and to find a solution to the growth point </p><p>dilemma.  CARE\'s Assistant Country Director Gwynne-Vaughn </p><p>seemed surprised to hear about this characterization of </p><p>growth points as urban areas and seemed willing to work on a </p><p>solution.  He also wondered aloud to PolOff whether the </p><p>ineligibility was due to the people having formal sector </p><p>employment. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Then, as testament to the politician that he is, </p><p>Msipa told the audience that he had met with President Robert </p><p>Mugabe and informed him of the plight of the people of Lower </p><p>Gweru and the launch of the C-SAFE project.  Mugabe told </p><p>Msipa to tell the people that he was working for them and </p><p>that he suffered with them.  Mugabe gave Msipa several bags </p><p>of fertilizer, which were delivered midway through the </p><p>ceremony, for the ward. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>12.  (C) PolOff was surprised at the ZANU-PF fertilizer </p><p>donation at, what was to be, an apolitical CARE/C-SAFE launch </p><p>and food distribution.  As far as PolOff could ascertain, </p><p>none of the other speeches, skits, or songs hinted at a </p><p>political party, although MDC member, Renson Gasela, who is </p><p>on trial for treason with Morgan Tsvangirai and Welshman </p><p>Ncube, represents the district.  Gwynne-Vaughn also was </p><p>surprised by the fertilizer donation, commenting to PolOff </p><p>that the normally moderate Msipa was a politician after all. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Comment Continued: PolOff is not sure if the Gweru </p><p>beneficiaries were aware of the origin of the food, although </p><p>the vegetable oil cans were printed with the letters USA. </p><p>The corn bags were printed with WFP and the beans were from </p><p>the U.S.  During the ceremony, PolOff was introduced with the </p><p>remark that the U.S. is the largest food aid donor.  In his </p><p>speech, Gwynne-Vaughn also mentioned that the U.S. is the </p><p>biggest donor to WFP and that USAID sponsors C-SAFE, although </p><p>it was not clear how many of those in the audience knew of </p><p>USAID\'s connection with the U.S. Government.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
