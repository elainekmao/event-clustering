(SBU) On April 24 the government press carried a </p><p>statement by Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veteran\'s </p><p>Association Director for Projects, Andrew Ndlovu, </p><p>that attacked resident Indians and Asians, accusing </p><p>them of economic sabotage, looting, and non-support of </p><p>the Government\'s indigenization and redistribution </p><p>efforts.  Ndlovu accused the long-resident communities </p><p>(which started after WW II and swelled in the 1960\'s </p><p>and 1970\'s) of buying large amounts of urban real </p><p>estate in the early 1980\'s when the majority of whites </p><p>left, and now charging exorbitant rents and operating </p><p>businesses that exploit blacks, through both high </p><p>prices and poor wages.  He declared "Operation </p><p>Liberation," which ordered them to surrender "a certain </p><p>portion of their land, to desist from illegal currency </p><p>dealing on the parallel market, reduce exorbitant </p><p>rentals, bank their money in locally-owned banks, and </p><p>improve the wages and working conditions of their </p><p>workers.  Nothing will stop us from reclaiming </p><p>commercial land which is also our birthright, and all </p><p>barriers of imperialism will be removed forcefully," </p><p>Ndlovu proclaimed. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Two days later on April 26, in an obvious </p><p>display of a lack of coordination and command, the </p><p>Association\'s Acting Chairman, Patrick Nyaruwata, </p><p>declared that members of the Asian and Indian community </p><p>should ignore Ndlovu\'s threats and ultimatums, and that </p><p>it was wrong for Ndlovu to assume that community </p><p>members were part of the colonialists.  "The Asians </p><p>also suffered during the years of oppression as they </p><p>were treated like second-class citizens together with </p><p>blacks.  The Indian community has been with us since </p><p>the early years of the struggle, and most of them </p><p>supported us during the formation of ZANU and ZAPU and </p><p>so it is not fair to condemn them when they have been </p><p>partners."   Ndlovu\'s muttered response during a radio </p><p>interview later that day was that the Chairman had </p><p>apparently been bribed, and on April 29 the veterans </p><p>association held a meeting with representatives from </p><p>the Indian community to again reassure them of their </p><p>common cause and linked patriotism.  Ndlovu, who was </p><p>directed to attend the pow-wow, only made utterances on </p><p>the war vets\' role in the redistribution of farming </p><p>land, and withheld further comments on his thwarted </p><p>urban ambitions. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Mission Econ and Commercial officers have </p><p>informally contacted representatives in the Asian and </p><p>Indian business communities and have been told that </p><p>their concern level is not particularly high.  An </p><p>Indian who heads up the major Mitsubishi auto </p><p>dealership here said that he has too many ZANU-PF </p><p>customers to get concerned, and is much more worried </p><p>about inflation, the parallel market rate and the food </p><p>shortage.  Most of the others we contacted view the </p><p>situation pragmatically, and one said that if it means </p><p>the handout of a couple of free cell phones a month - </p><p>well, it\'s just another cost of doing business. </p><p>Another said that they (the Indians) have friends and </p><p>contacts in many places and that Ndlovu is clearly in </p><p>over his head.  "The troubles that we face in Zimbabwe </p><p>are much less so than in much of the rest of Africa, </p><p>and while the whites are still here we can carry on. </p><p>When they are all gone we may have to make different </p><p>arrangements, but for now we shall continue to operate </p><p>our businesses.  Ndlovu has been told to drop the </p><p>matter, and if he has any brains will do as he is </p><p>told." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment: Pragmatism and a degree of </p><p>plasticity regarding business and operating rules has </p><p>allowed both the Asian and Indian communities to sail </p><p>relatively unscathed to date through this latest, low- </p><p>level attempt at rolling out a variant of the ruling </p><p>party\'s indigenization program.  Both communities have </p><p>been on the ground for a long time and seem to realize </p><p>when legal principles can be relied on and when other </p><p>operating methods may be more productive.  For now at </p><p>least, it seems that someone in government has weighed </p><p>the costs and benefits of targeting Asian or Indian </p><p>assets, and decided to move on in search of an easier </p><p>score.  In addition, the War Vets Association has been </p><p>beset by internal power squabbles, and Ndlovu was </p><p>probably trying to get his name in the papers and </p><p>burnish his "revolutionary" credentials ahead of the </p><p>war vets\' congress later this year. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) It is noteworthy that the GOZ never took a </p><p>position on the war vet threat, but let the war vet </p><p>leader put down his subordinate.  A different </p><p>interpretation of events would be that the Indian/Asian </p><p>community was warned to provide more "kickbacks" and </p><p>will duly comply or suffer the consequences. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) For what it\'s worth, the Indian High </p><p>Commissioner told the Ambassador that no one in the </p><p>Indian community here had raise the issue with him, nor </p><p>he with the GOZ, indicating that Ndlovu\'s bluster is </p><p>probably not a major preoccupation within Asian/Indian </p><p>circles.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
