<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001675 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IPC SWILSON; WHA/CAN PNORMAN; AND EB/DCT </p><p>USDOC FOR CBUSQUETS </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR SCHANDLER AND CBURCKY </p><p>DEPT ALSO PASS FDA FOR MECKLES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ECON, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN PHARMACEUTICAL PATENTS: PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>COMMITTEE POSTPONES DECISION TO AMEND REGULATIONS </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary ) A Parliamentary committee has postponed a </p><p>decision to recommend changes to Canada,s drug patent rules </p><p>that cover the process for bringing generic drugs to the </p><p>market once the innovator,s patents expire.  The Canadian </p><p>review mirrors the recent U.S. deliberations on the </p><p>Hatch-Waxman law that led to a June 12 decision by the FDA to </p><p>streamline the process for bringing generics to the market. </p><p>The committee,s decision to delay a recommendation for </p><p>possible regulatory change before the end of the current </p><p>Parliamentary session is seen as a temporary victory for the </p><p>brand-name pharmaceutical companies that oppose any </p><p>legislative changes.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. After four days of testimony, the House Industry and </p><p>Science committee postponed a decision to recommend reform of </p><p>Canada,s drug patent rules until Parliament reconvenes in </p><p>the fall.  The committee reviewed the Patented Medicine </p><p>Notice of Compliance (NOC) Regulations, which are also known </p><p>as the &linkage regulations8 because these rules link the </p><p>regulatory approval of a generic drug to the patent status of </p><p>the drug it seeks to copy.  A similar review of the </p><p>Hatch-Waxman law in the U.S. led to the recent FDA decision, </p><p>announced by President Bush on June 12, to institute new </p><p>regulations to streamline the process for bringing generic </p><p>drugs to the market. </p><p> </p><p>3. The linkage regulations, which were last amended in 1998, </p><p>block Health Canada from approving a generic drug for up to </p><p>two years if there is any allegation of patent infringement. </p><p>Generic companies complained that by filing sequential </p><p>patents on minor improvements on a drug and then alleging </p><p>infringement on each, brand-name companies can "evergreen8 </p><p>the market for a drug long after its original 20-year patent </p><p>expires.  The generics proposed scrapping the automatic </p><p>24-month injunction altogether.  The brand-name manufacturers </p><p>encouraged the committee to maintain the status quo, arguing </p><p>that the automatic injunction is necessary to prevent patent </p><p>infringement and encourage the development of new drugs. </p><p>Canada and the U.S. are the only countries that provide an </p><p>automatic injunction in cases of alleged patent infringement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The recent high profile review of the Canadian health care </p><p>system by Roy Romanov, which was released last fall, </p><p>recommended that the GOC consider overhauling the Notice of </p><p>Compliance regulations.  Health Canada, which administers the </p><p>regulations, generally agreed with this recommendation, </p><p>testifying to the committee that the growing complexity of </p><p>patents has made it difficult for them to administer the NOC </p><p>regulations.  Industry Canada, on the other hand, argued </p><p>against changes to the regulations, noting that they are </p><p>necessary to protect and promote incremental innovation by </p><p>brand-name companies.  The Parliamentary committee was evenly </p><p>divided on the issue and determined that they needed more </p><p>information before deciding on whether or not to amend the </p><p>regulations. </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment ) Failure to reach a decision is a victory for </p><p>the brand-name drug companies, who had hoped to avoid the </p><p>Parliamentary review of the regulations altogether.  With the </p><p>upcoming Canadian elections it is not clear when or if the </p><p>committee will reconvene to make a final decision on whether </p><p>or not the regulations will be amended.  Although Canada,s </p><p>patent regime is generally considered more pro-generic than </p><p>the U.S. system, even after the recent decision by the FDA, </p><p>the perception that the U.S. is taking action to &lower the </p><p>costs8 of prescription medications could motivate the </p><p>committee to recommend changes to the linkage regulations. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
