(C)  SUMMARY:  FOLLOWING ZIMBABWE\'S JUNE 24-25 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER </p><p>AFRICAN COUNTRIES HERE HAVE STATED THEIR INTENTION </p><p>TO REACH OUT TO BOTH ZANU-PF AND THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) AND URGE BOTH SIDES TO WORK </p><p>TOWARD NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.  PARTICIPANTS IN A </p><p>JUNE 27 MEETING OF THE AFRICAN DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>STRESSED THIS THEME, AS DID SENIOR SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIAN EBRAHIM EBRAHIM IN A JUNE 28 </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH US.  EBRAHIM HAD MET THE PREVIOUS </p><p>EVENING WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE AND FOUND HIM TO BE IN </p><p>A CONCILIATORY FRAME OF MIND, ALTHOUGH STILL </p><p>PREOCCUPIED WITH PERCEIVED PLOTS AGAINST HIM.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>READOUT ON SOUTH AFRICAN MEETING WITH MUGABE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN A JUNE 28 CONVERSATION WITH CAPE TOWN- </p><p>BASED TDY POLOFF, SENIOR SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIAN EBRAHIM EBRAHIM DISCUSSED SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA\'S PLANS FOR NEXT STEPS REGARDING RELATIONS </p><p>WITH ZIMBABWE FOLLOWING THE JUNE 24-25 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION.  EBRAHIM, WHO CHAIRS PARLIAMENT\'S FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND SITS ON THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OF THE ANC\'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE </p><p>COUNCIL, HAD PARTICIPATED IN PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S JUNE </p><p>27 MEETING WITH THREE MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03545  01 OF 02  290913Z </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY OBSERVER DELEGATION.  EBRAHIM SAID </p><p>THAT HE HAD FOUND MUGABE TO BE IN A FAIRLY </p><p>CONCILIATORY FRAME OF MIND AND FOCUSED ON </p><p>RECONCILIATION IN THE WAKE OF THE VIOLENCE THAT TOOK </p><p>PLACE IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE ELECTIONS.  MUGABE HAD </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED, EBRAHIM SAID, THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO </p><p>MAKE SOME SORT OF GESTURE TO VICTIMS OF THE </p><p>VIOLENCE.  HOWEVER, EBRAHIM ALSO FOUND THAT MUGABE </p><p>WAS STILL PREOCCUPIED WITH SUPPOSED CONSPIRACIES </p><p>AGAINST HIM BY THE BRITISH AND OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  SOUTH AFRICA, EBRAHIM TOLD POLOFF, WILL </p><p>REMAIN CLOSELY ENGAGED WITH ZIMBABWE TO ENCOURAGE A </p><p>PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND THE </p><p>REVITALIZATION OF ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>HE WAS PLEASED WITH THE USG\'S ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT\'S QUIET DIPLOMACY APPROACH, </p><p>AND TOLD POLOFF THAT A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICANS WILL BE ENCOURAGING THE HEALING OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S RIFT WITH BRITAIN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE SAG, EBRAHIM SAID, WILL SEEK TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN ITS TIES WITH BOTH ZANU-PF AND THE MDC </p><p>AND WILL ENCOURAGE MUGABE TO OFFER A FEW CABINET </p><p>POSITIONS TO THE MDC.  ASKED ABOUT STRAINS BETWEEN </p><p>THE MDC AND THE ANC, EBRAHIM, WHO WAS ABOUT TO MEET </p><p>WITH SENIOR MDC MEMBER WELSHMAN NCUBE BEFORE </p><p>DEPARTING FOR SOUTH AFRICA, ACKNOWLEDGED THE RIFT </p><p>AND SAID IT WAS TIME THAT IT WAS REPAIRED.  EBRAHIM </p><p>NOTED THAT MUGABE REMAINED SUSPICIOUS OF THE MDC\'S </p><p>SUPPOSED FOREIGN FINANCIAL BACKING, AND IMPLICITLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03545  01 OF 02  290913Z </p><p>EXPRESSED AGREEMENT WITH THIS SUSPICION BY POINTING </p><p>OUT THAT A WELL-ORGANIZED MDC RALLY EBRAHIM HAD </p><p>RECENTLY ATTENDED INCLUDED A SLICKLY PRODUCED VIDEO </p><p>THAT "COULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY SAATCHI AND </p><p>SAATCHI."  (NOTE:  AN MDC OFFICIAL HAS TOLD US THAT </p><p>THE PARTY MADE A MISTAKE IN REACHING OUT TO THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PARTY, SOUTH AFRICA\'S OFFICIAL </p><p>OPPOSITION, BEFORE THE ANC.  SHE THOUGHT THE MDC AND </p><p>ANC COULD IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONS, BUT OPINED THAT </p><p>THE ANC HAD LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT THE LABOR UNION COSATU, WHICH IS A </p><p>COALITION PARTNER OF THE ANC, WOULD TAKE A LESSON </p><p>FROM THE LABOR-BASED MDC AND CHALLENGE THE ANC FROM </p><p>WITHOUT.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  EBRAHIM TOLD POLOFF THAT HE WAS PLEASED </p><p>WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION.  THERE WAS ONLY A </p><p>NARROW RANGE OF OUTCOMES IN WHICH PEACE WOULD BE </p><p>POSSIBLE, AND ZANU-PF\'S NARROW VICTORY FELL WITHIN </p><p>THIS RANGE.  IN PARTICULAR, A ZANU-PF LOSS COULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN DESTABILIZING.  EBRAHIM NOTED THAT, UNLIKE </p><p>IN THE PAST, WHEN ZIMBABWE WAS ESSENTIALLY A ONE- </p><p>PARTY STATE, THERE IS NOW A MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM.  HE </p><p>REJECTED THE VIEW OF THE EU MISSION AND OTHERS THAT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0437 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03545  02 OF 02  290913Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------684F0D  290913Z /38 </p><p>P 290914Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6468 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003545 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR P/DAS POWELL AND DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.

WHILE NOT RULING OUT THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT ZANU-PF HAD WON SOME SEATS UNFAIRLY, EBRAHIM </p><p>OPINED THAT THE ELECTION HAD SUBSTANTIALLY REFLECTED </p><p>THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.  THE MDC, HE SAID, SHOULD </p><p>ACCEPT THE OUTCOME IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION.  HE RECALLED THAT THERE HAD BEEN </p><p>WIDESPREAD DOUBT WITHIN THE ANC ABOUT THE RIVAL </p><p>INKATHA FREEDOM PARTY\'S VICTORY IN KWAZULU-NATAL </p><p>(EBRAHIM\'S HOME AREA) IN SOUTH AFRICA\'S FIRST </p><p>DEMOCRATIC ELECTION IN 1994, BUT THE PARTY HAD </p><p>ACCEPTED THE INKATHA WIN IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS URGE "UNITY IN DIVERSITY" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  TANZANIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER ALEXANDER </p><p>MUGANDA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR JUNE 28 THAT THE AFRICAN </p><p>AMBASSADORS HERE HAD MET THE DAY BEFORE TO DISCUSS </p><p>POST-ELECTION ENGAGEMENT WITH THE GOZ.  THE AFRICAN </p><p>AMBASSADORS AGREED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO HELP </p><p>ZIMBABWE HEAL ITS WOUNDS; ACCEPTANCE OF THE ELECTION </p><p>RESULTS BY BOTH SIDES WOULD FOSTER THIS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADORS PLAN TO ENCOURAGE ZIMBABWEANS TO EMBRACE </p><p>"UNITY IN DIVERSITY" AS A REAL MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM </p><p>EMERGES HERE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  THE AFRICAN AMBASSADOR AGREED AT THE </p><p>MEETING THAT THERE ARE REAL WOUNDS THAT MUST BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03545  02 OF 02  290913Z </p><p>HEALED.  A VILLAGER WHOSE HOUSE HAS BEEN BURNED DOWN </p><p>NEEDS TO HEAR WORDS OF RECONCILIATION FROM THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THE AMBASSADORS PLAN TO ASK THEIR </p><p>CAPITALS FOR GUIDANCE ON NEXT STEPS; IN DOING SO </p><p>THEY WILL ENCOURAGE A POLICY OF QUIET COMMUNICATION </p><p>WITH BOTH ZANU-PF AND THE MDC.  THE TANZANIAN HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER HAD TOLD AMBASSADOR MCDONALD SHORTLY </p><p>BEFORE THE ELECTION THAT MOST OF THE AFRICAN </p><p>AMBASSADORS HAD MET AS A GROUP WITH ZANU-PF NATIONAL </p><p>CHAIRMAN JOHN NKOMO TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT CONTINUED </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE NON-CONFRONTATIONAL STANCE </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA AND OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES TOOK BEFORE </p><p>THE ELECTIONS MAY AFFORD THEM GREATER ENTREE TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LEADERSHIP THAN THAT GRANTED TO OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES.  IT IS ENCOURAGING TO SEE THAT THEY PLAN </p><p>TO REACH OUT TO ALL SIDES AND THAT MESSAGE THEY </p><p>DELIVER IS LIKELY TO BE ONE OF RECONCILIATION.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
