CARITAS PREDICTED THAT MILITARY ACTION </p><p>WOULD CAUSE A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE, AFFECTING CHILDREN </p><p>THE MOST, AND URGED THAT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE BE DONE TO </p><p>AVOID WAR.  CARITAS\' ACCESS TO IRAQ WAS DEPENDENT IN PART ON </p><p>PROVIDING ADVOCACY REGARDING CURRENT PROBLEMS ATTRIBUTED TO </p><p>U.N. SANCTIONS.  THEY ARE EXPECTED TO RELEASE AN OFFICIAL </p><p>STATEMENT SHORTLY THAT WILL IN TURN HELP SHAPE THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE HUMANITARIAN CONSEQUENCES OF </p><p>WAR.  CI HAS CALLED A MEETING AT ITS VATICAN HEADQUARTERS </p><p>DECEMBER 17-18 TO DISCUSS ITS OFFICIAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE </p><p>STRATEGY IN THE EVENT OF WAR IN IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF WAR AND SANCTIONS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. A CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS DELEGATION LED BY CARITAS\' </p><p>BRITISH OFFICE HEAD, AND INCLUDING CI\'S GLOBAL ISSUES DESK </p><p>OFFICER, IRAQ OFFICE DIRECTOR (BASED IN AMMAN, JORDAN), AND </p><p>MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA OFFICE DIRECTOR FROM BEIRUT MET </p><p>WITH CHURCH OFFICIALS, IRAQI DEPUTY PM TARIQ AZIZ AND OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DURING A RECENT VISIT TO IRAQ TO ASSES </p><p>THE IMPLICATIONS OF MILITARY ACTION AND CURRENT SANCTIONS. </p><p>CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS IS A 154-MEMBER FEDERATION OF </p><p>CATHOLIC RELIEF AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES OPERATIVE IN 198 </p><p>COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES, HEADQUARTERED IN VATICAN CITY BUT </p><p>INDEPENDENT FROM THE HOLY SEE. ITS VATICAN CITY OFFICE </p><p>PROVIDES A FORUM FOR EXCHANGE AND DIALOGUE AMONG MEMBER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05296  01 OF 02  291503Z </p><p>AGENCIES AND ADVOCACY SERVICES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) CI TOLD US "OFF THE RECORD" THAT ENTRY TO IRAQ WAS </p><p>CONDITIONAL ON CARITAS SUBSEQUENTLY ACTING AS AN ADVOCATE </p><p>FOR THE IRAQI CAUSE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA.  THE IRAQIS </p><p>DID NOT WANT CI CONDUCTING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY </p><p>ASSESSMENT THEY HAD ORIGINALLY INTENDED.  HOWEVER, CI </p><p>BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GAIN ACCESS TO IRAQ AND SO TOOK </p><p>THE MIDDLE ROAD BY PROMISING ADVOCACY ASSISTANCE WHILE </p><p>CHECKING IRAQ\'S PREPAREDNESS FOR ANY MILITARY ACTIVITY THAT </p><p>MIGHT RESULT IN A FURTHER HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY. DURING THE </p><p>VISIT, THE DELEGATION WAS PERMITTED TO BRING IN A </p><p>PHOTOGRAPHER -- WHOSE ACTIVITIES WERE CLOSELY MONITORED. </p><p>THE GROUP ENCOUNTERED SOME IRAQI OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE </p><p>OF THE CI OFFICIALS FROM AMMAN AND BEIRUT BECAUSE THEY SPOKE </p><p>ARABIC -- DISPENSING WITH THE NEED FOR AN OFFICIAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT INTERPRETER. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) IN AN UNOFFICIAL INITIAL ASSESSMENT RELEASED TO </p><p>POST, THE CI DELEGATION REPORTED THAT WOMAN AND CHILDREN </p><p>WERE IN "BAD CONDITION" CLAIMING ONE IN THREE CHILDREN IS </p><p>MALNOURISHED.  CARITAS MAINTAINS THAT SANCTIONS ARE TO BLAME </p><p>FOR 75 PERCENT OF THE IRAQI POPULATION EXPERIENCING "POOR </p><p>LIVING CONDITIONS" WITH THE AVERAGE INCOME BETWEEN $3 AND $5 </p><p>PER DAY -- "NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR BASIC NECESSITIES."  CI </p><p>CLAIMED THAT WATER ACCESS AND SECURITY HAS DETERIORATED OVER </p><p>THE LAST 10 YEARS, QUOTING UN FIGURES THAT ONLY 43 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE RURAL POPULATION HAS DIRECT ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER. </p><p>CI\'S ASSESSMENT WILL SUGGEST THAT A MILITARY STRIKE ON IRAQ </p><p>WOULD CAUSE "TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS," WITH CHILDREN BEING THE </p><p>MOST AFFECTED.  PREVIOUS CARITAS DELEGATIONS TO IRAQ HAVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05296  01 OF 02  291503Z </p><p>MADE SIMILAR ASSESSMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) CI INSISTS THAT EVERYTHING MUST BE DONE TO PREPARE </p><p>FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF A MILITARY STRIKE, BUT THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "MUST ALSO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO </p><p>AVOID WAR." CI CLAIMS MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ WOULD </p><p>CAUSE A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE WITH SEVERE CONSEQUENCES </p><p>FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  FOLLOWING UP ON THE VISIT, CI </p><p>HAS CALLED A MEETING AT ITS VATICAN CITY HEADQUARTERS FOR </p><p>DECEMBER 17 AND 18 TO DISCUSS ITS OFFICIAL EMERGENCY </p><p>RESPONSE STRATEGY FOR IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.
