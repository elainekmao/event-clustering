<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: OPPOSITION MAYOR OF MASVINGO GAINING </p><p>GRUDGING ACCEPTANCE FROM RULING PARTY </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1463 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Todd Faulk for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On June 27, poloff met in Harare with Alois Chaimiti, </p><p>the MDC Mayor of Masvingo and the first opposition mayor in </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s post-independence history.  Chaimiti came into </p><p>office in May 2001 after a typically violent election </p><p>campaign.  In the 13 months since his installation, Chaimiti </p><p>has gained the grudging acceptance of the ZANU-PF-dominated </p><p>City Council, and he contends that he is making progress in </p><p>improving city services and demonstrating that the opposition </p><p>party is capable of governing.  The ZANU-PF Minister of Local </p><p>Government, Ignatius Chombo, and Governor of Masvingo, Josiah </p><p>Hungwe, have even begun to acknowledge his presence in </p><p>public, Chaimiti laughed. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) When Chaimiti first came into office, the City </p><p>Council, which comprises two independents and eight ZANU-PF </p><p>members, had difficulty accepting and working with him, much </p><p>as the council of Chitungwiza hinders its new mayor (reftel). </p><p> Difficulties still arise, but now the council generally </p><p>takes a live-and-let-live approach and is cooperating with </p><p>the Mayor in improving city services and repaving some city </p><p>streets.  Chaimiti admitted some surprise when the Ministry </p><p>of Local Government approved in February 2002 his application </p><p>for city status for Masvingo, which has about 100,000 people. </p><p> Shortly after his election, Chaimiti sent letters to Chombo </p><p>and Governor Hungwe signaling his desire to work congenially </p><p>with them for the benefit of Masvingo.  Chombo simply ignored </p><p>his letter, but Hungwe reportedly became "very angry" and for </p><p>a long time refused to appear in public with Chaimiti. </p><p>Recently, however, Hungwe\'s "hard feelings" appear to have </p><p>abated somewhat, as he has shown up at some of the same </p><p>public functions that the mayor attends, and even indirectly </p><p>acknowledges his presence. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Chaimiti attributed the partial turnaround in ZANU-PF </p><p>attitudes to: 1) the "overwhelming" support the MDC enjoys in </p><p>urban Masvingo, and 2) the city\'s ability to raise funds </p><p>locally and operate independently from the central </p><p>government.  Soon after his election in May 2001, ZANU-PF </p><p>organized a large, angry protest at the mayor\'s office.  A </p><p>few months later, a similar effort fizzled because ZANU-PF </p><p>was simply unable to find enough local people willing to </p><p>protest against the MDC, Chaimiti claimed.  After the March </p><p>presidential election, a few ZANU-PF youth paraded around </p><p>town with a mock coffin labeled "MDC" and called for </p><p>retribution against MDC supporters.  However, the retribution </p><p>failed to materialize, and Chaimiti reported that he has been </p><p>untouched by the threats of violence or actual violence that </p><p>befall so many other MDC officials.  Furthermore, the city of </p><p>Masvingo now obtains 90 to 95 percent of its revenues from </p><p>local residents in the form of property taxes and service </p><p>revenues (water, sewerage, etc.).  The rest of the funds come </p><p>from bond issues that must be approved by the Minister of </p><p>Local Government, but the city no longer receives any funds </p><p>directly from the central government, which is basically </p><p>broke, Chaimiti said.  This gives local authorities much more </p><p>independence than they used to have.  The GOZ is so desperate </p><p>for funds now that it is even trying to squeeze relatively </p><p>successful local governments for money.  Masvingo has so far </p><p>resisted the pressure, and instead, has compelled the central </p><p>government to pay back service fees for the offices and </p><p>colleges that it operates in town.  Chaimiti added that his </p><p>job is likely to get easier after council elections are held </p><p>in August of next year. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Chaimiti took time to thank the USG for the </p><p>USAID-funded projects that have built 3,100 housing units in </p><p>two Masvingo suburbs, and for the USAID-funded good </p><p>governance project that has improved relations between the </p><p>City Council and the new Resident Taxpayers\' Association. </p><p>Chaimiti made a pitch for the U.S. to establish a sister-city </p><p>relationship with Masvingo and inform American cities that </p><p>they should not be overly wary of Zimbabwe, where they can </p><p>still be of help.  The mayor noted that Masvingo\'s </p><p>sister-city relationships with towns in Germany, Sweden and </p><p>the UK have yielded positive results.  Kernan, Germany, for </p><p>example, has been very helpful by building two clinics in </p><p>Masvingo and providing hospital equipment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: The City of Masvingo, with the oldest MDC </p><p>administration in Zimbabwe, provides a testing ground and </p><p>possible glimpse of what MDC/ZANU-PF cooperation could be </p><p>like for the new mayors of Harare and Chitungwiza (reftel). </p><p>However, ZANU-PF\'s kid-glove treatment of Chaimiti is less </p><p>likely due to a genuine desire for cooperation than a </p><p>realization that its support in rural Masvingo is </p><p>half-hearted, and ZANU-PF rebel Eddison Zvobgo could mobilize </p><p>public opinion against the regime province-wide if it </p><p>inflamed the situation with attacks on the mayor. </p><p>Nonetheless, the GOZ has to be concerned with the growing </p><p>independence of local governments and the proving ground they </p><p>provide the MDC for its ability to govern responsibly in </p><p>direct contrast to the central government.  It may be only a </p><p>matter of time before the GOZ turns its attention to this </p><p>growing "problem" and rewrites the legislation that governs </p><p>local authorities.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
