<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002187 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PREL, CVIS, CJAN, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: REPATRIATION OF DETAINED ALIENS TO NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 143469 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Mission shares the concern of Washington agencies that </p><p>criminal aliens be repatriated without undue delay to their </p><p>country of nationality.  We want to work jointly with all </p><p>concerned agencies to facilitate and speed repatriation of </p><p>Nigerian criminal aliens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  We would welcome the opportunity to demarche the GON on </p><p>the issue of delayed repatriation of the 81 criminal aliens </p><p>of immediate concern.  However, the Department needs first to </p><p>obtain for us the case-by-case details that will allow us to </p><p>address this issue effectively.  We need to know in each case </p><p>whether the Department believes that the Nigerian Mission to </p><p>the U.S. is merely dragging its feet or whether proof of </p><p>nationality (i.e., passport) is not available.  At this </p><p>point, we do not know why the Nigerian Mission has not </p><p>documented these 81 persons.  If this information is known to </p><p>Washington agencies, we, too, need to have it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  If the USG possesses proof of Nigerian nationality, our </p><p>demarche would logically take a different form than if we </p><p>lack such proof.  In cases where we have such proof, we </p><p>should insist that the GON take responsibility for its </p><p>nationals.  If we lack such proof in some cases, we may need </p><p>to work cooperatively with the GON to locate evidence to </p><p>substantiate Nigerian nationality.  We seriously doubt that </p><p>in past years the GON filed passport applications in such a </p><p>way that systematic retrieval would be possible.  While the </p><p>advent of machine-readable passports several years ago may </p><p>have improved file retrieval, it is likely that few (if any) </p><p>of the 81 came to the U.S. with MRPs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  If we make our demarche at sufficiently high levels and </p><p>with the right people, Mission believes that the GON will </p><p>work with us.  However, GON law enforcement agencies are </p><p>critically underfunded.  The USG may need to commit new </p><p>resources to the effort, especially if visits to civil status </p><p>registries in remote locations are required.  Our anti-fraud </p><p>unit is insufficiently staffed to resolve the cases already </p><p>before it and could not be tapped for this purpose. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Mission would also like to know what is being sought from </p><p>the GON beyond acceptance of the 81 persons now at issue.  If </p><p>there appear to be systemic problems, such as lack of </p><p>communication between the Nigerian Mission to the U.S. and </p><p>Immigration Headquarters in Abuja, we would be pleased to see </p><p>if we could help facilitate improvement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  We believe the GON seeks information on convictions in </p><p>order to avail itself of a Nigerian law that criminalizes </p><p>conduct (such as smuggling drugs) that brings Nigeria into </p><p>disrepute.  Post can provide further detail on this law if </p><p>the Department requires it. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
