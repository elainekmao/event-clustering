<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 001393 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR, Regional Issues </p><p>SUBJECT:  CROATIAN OFFICIALS CONDEMN THE RIOT IN BELGRADE </p><p> </p><p>REF: BELGRADE 1420 </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING THE JUNE 15 ATTACK ON THE CROATIAN EMBASSY IN </p><p>BELGRADE BY A LARGE GROUP OF SPORTS HOOLIGANS (REFTEL) -- </p><p>WHICH CAME AFTER SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO DEFEATED CROATIA IN </p><p>THE WATER-POLO FINALS OF THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS IN </p><p>KRANJ, SLOVENIA -- CROATIA\'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP PUT OUT </p><p>STRONG STATEMENTS OF CONDEMNATION.  PRIME MINISTER RACAN </p><p>REGRETTED THAT THE VANDALISM IN BELGRADE HAD NOT </p><p>IMMEDIATELY BEEN CONDEMNED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN </p><p>    BELGRADE.  "WE ALL KNOW HOW THE LACK OF PROMPT REACTION TO </p><p>THIS TYPE OF PRIMITIVISM LED TO THE EVIL THAT OCCURRED IN </p><p>OUR RECENT PAST," RACAN SAID IN A TELEVISED STATEMENT.  THE </p><p>PM ALSO CRITICIZED CROATIAN HOOLIGANS AT THE CHAMPIONSHIPS </p><p>WHO ATTACKED SUPPORTERS OF THE SAM TEAM.  HE ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>HE WOULD PUSH FOR A LAW ON SPORTS FANS TO BE PREPARED ON AN </p><p>URGENT BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOR HIS PART, FOREIGN MINISTER TONINO PICULA CANCELED </p><p>HIS TRIP TO MONTENEGRO SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 16 AND 17. </p><p>PICULA CALLED THE INCIDENTS THE WORST SINCE THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IN 1997, BUT HE </p><p>ALSO EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THE TENSIONS WOULD SUBSIDE SOON. </p><p>THE SAM AMBASSADOR TO ZAGREB, MILAN SIMURDIC, WHO WAS ON </p><p>HAND FOR THE FINALS IN SLOVENIA, TOLD US JUNE 17 HE HOPED </p><p>THE MATTER WAS OVER.  HE HAD BEEN CALLED IN TO THE MFA AT </p><p>12:30 AM AFTER THE ATTACK ON THE EMBASSY BUILDING IN </p><p>BELGRADE.  HE SAID HE REGRETTED THAT PICULA FELT A NEED TO </p><p>CANCEL HIS TRIP TO PODGORICA.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER </p><p>HAD HE TRAVELED, AND EVEN PERHAPS STOPPED OVER IN BELGRADE </p><p>ON HIS WAY BACK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DEPLORING THE INCIDENT IN BELGRADE, AS WELL AS THE ONE </p><p>IN SLOVENIA WHICH PROMPTED IT, PRESIDENT MESIC SAID THAT </p><p>BLAME CAN USUALLY BE SHARED.  "ONE EVENT CAUSES THE OTHER." </p><p>HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT "ORGANIZERS ARE ALSO TO BLAME SINCE </p><p>THEY KNEW THIS WAS A HIGH-RISK GAME BUT FAILED TO TAKE </p><p>APPROPRIATE (SECURITY) MEASURES." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p></p><p>4.  THE LATEST INCIDENTS, INVOLVING SPORTS HOOLIGANS ON </p><p>BOTH THE SERBIAN AND CROATIAN SIDES, ARE NOT LIKELY TO </p><p>AFFECT SERIOUSLY THE TREND IN THE OVERALL BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  RELATIONS BETWEEN AUTHORITIES IN ZAGREB AND </p><p>BELGRADE ARE GENERALLY PROGRESSING -- TO WIT, THE RECENT </p><p>DECISION BY EACH GOVERNMENT TO DO AWAY WITH, AT LEAST </p><p>TEMPORARILY, VISA REQUIREMENTS.  THE INCIDENTS, HOWEVER, DO </p><p>SHOW THAT UNDER THE POLITICAL SURFACE WARTIME ANIMOSITIES </p><p>REMAIN, AND WILL HAVE TO BE MANAGED AS THE PROCESS OF </p><p>NORMALIZATION UNFOLDS. </p><p>MOON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
