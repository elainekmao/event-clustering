<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIRUT 02181 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN AND AID/ANE/MENA </p><p> </p><p>USDA FOR PAUL KIENDALL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  EAID, EAGR, ETRD, BEXP, PGOV, PINR, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  LEBANON:  EXCHANGE WITH MFA ECONOMIC DIRECTOR </p><p>          ON U.S. WHEAT AID AND SALES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIRUT 2062 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN SUMMARY:  MFA DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS </p><p>SALLOUKH MADE DEMARCHE TO DCM ON FAMILIAR THEME OF A </p><p>GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT WHEAT PROGRAM WITH THE U.S. </p><p>SALLOUKH ARGUED THAT FREE WHEAT WOULD HAVE GOOD </p><p>PROPAGANDA VALUE FOR THE U.S. AND WOULD HELP THE </p><p>GOL\'S FINANCES.  REGARDING DISTRIBUTION, SALLOUKH </p><p>THOUGHT THAT ALL FOREIGN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO LEBANON </p><p>WERE FLAWED IN THIS REGARD AND CONTENDED THAT LEBANON </p><p>WAS NO WORSE THAN OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE SMUGGLING </p><p>PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO HIM, IS GREATLY EXAGGERATED; </p><p>ONLY "5 PERCENT" OF LEBANESE BREAD IS DIVERTED TO </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  THE DCM STRESSED THAT THE USG </p><p>IS CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION TO ALL </p><p>CONFESSIONS WITHOUT MILITIA INVOLVEMENT.  EVEN IF </p><p>LEBANON WERE GRANTED FREE WHEAT FROM THE U.S., IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH OUR WORLDWIDE POLICY, IT WOULD BE TIED </p><p>TO THE GOL\'S ENACTING ECONOMIC REFORMS.  SPECIFICALLY, </p><p>THE GOL WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF ITS </p><p>38.7 MILLION USD BREAD SUBSIDY.  THE DCM STATED THAT </p><p>RECENT PRESS REPORTS, CITING AMBASSADOR BOUHABIB AS </p><p>BLAMING THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BEIRUT FOR BLOCKING A </p><p>WHEAT PROGRAM, WERE ERRONEOUS AND THE DECISION TO </p><p>PROVIDE AID INVOLVES VARIOUS AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS </p><p>IN THE USG.  REGARDING WHEAT SALES, THE DCM UNDERLINED </p><p>OUR STRONG DESIRE TO BE GIVEN A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>COMPETE IN GOL WHEAT TENDERS.  SALLOUKH PLANS TO ENLIST </p><p>ECONOMY MINISTER QASSIR\'S HELP IN PREPARING A REPORT </p><p>ON THE WHEAT SITUATION IN LEBANON.  HE WILL ALSO RAISE </p><p>U.S. INTEREST IN COMPETING FOR GOL WHEAT TENDERS WITH THE </p><p>MINISTER.  THE DCM REPLIED THAT WE WELCOMED ANY </p><p>INFORMATION SALLOUKH COULD PROVIDE ON BOTH SUBJECTS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON APRIL 12, DCM, ACCOMPANIED BY ECON COUNSELOR, </p><p>PAID INTRODUCTORY CALL ON AMBASSADOR FAWZI SALLOUKH, </p><p>LEBANESE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ECONOMIC DIRECTOR. </p><p>MEETING LASTED APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR.  THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>TOPIC OF DISCUSSION WAS WHEAT FOR LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AMBASSADOR SALLOUKH MADE A STRONG PITCH FOR A </p><p>GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT WHEAT PROGRAM, WITH THE USG </p><p>PROVIDING FREE WHEAT TO LEBANON.  SALLOUKH INDICATED THAT </p><p>AMBASSADOR BOUHABIB HAS ALREADY RENEWED THIS REQUEST IN </p><p>WASHINGTON.  FIRST AMONG THE REASONS CITED BY SALLOUKH </p><p>FOR A WHEAT PROGRAM WAS THE "PROPAGANDA" VALUE FOR THE </p><p>U.S. IN SO DIRECTLY HELPING THE GOL.  SECONDLY, SALLOUKH </p><p>STATED THAT FREE WHEAT WOULD ASSIST THE GOL IN COPING </p><p>WITH ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE SHORTAGE.  SALLOUKH PROPOSED A </p><p>U.S. WHEAT GRANT BE HANDLED AS A REGULAR WHEAT PURCHASE. </p><p>THAT IS, THE GOL WOULD SELL THE FREE WHEAT TO THE </p><p>MILLERS WHO IN TURN WOULD SELL THE FLOUR TO BAKERS.  THE </p><p>HARD CURRENCY SAVED FROM NOT HAVING TO PURCHASE WHEAT </p><p>COULD BE SPENT ELSEWHERE, TOWARD PAYING LEBANON\'S </p><p>EXTERNAL DEBT OR PURCHASES OF FOREIGN-MADE EQUIPMENT FOR </p><p>LEBANON\'S PUBLIC UTILITIES, FOR EXAMPLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SALLOUKH STATED THIS FRIDAY, APRIL 15, HE WILL BE </p><p>MEETING ECONOMY MINISTER VICTOR QASSIR.  SALLOUKH WILL </p><p>SEEK THE MINISTER\'S SUPPORT IN PREPARING A REPORT ON </p><p>THE WHEAT SITUATION IN LEBANON TO BE PROVIDED TO THE </p><p>U.S. </p><p> </p><p>6.  DCM TOOK THAT OPENING TO EXPLAIN TO SALLOUKH THAT </p><p>PRESS REPORTS APPARENTLY STIMULATED BY LEBANESE </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. ABDALLAH BOUHABIB THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON FAVORED WHEAT AID TO LEBANON BUT THAT IT WAS </p><p>OUR EVIL EMBASSY IN BEIRUT THAT WAS BLOCKING IT WERE </p><p>UNINFORMED.  FIRST OF ALL, ON THE BASIS OF THE SEVERE </p><p>NEED WE PERCEIVED HERE LAST FALL WHEN THE LEBANESE POUND </p><p>AND PRICES HAD GONE CRAZY, WORSENING THE PLIGHT OF </p><p>ALREADY POOR PEOPLE, WE HAD INCREASED THE FOOD AID THAT </p><p>WE PROVIDED LEBANON THROUGH PVO\'S BY 35 PERCENT, TO A </p><p>VALUE OF SOME USD 23 MILLION.  SECONDLY, THE DECISION TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE FOOD AID BY THAT ROUTE, AS OPPOSED TO </p><p>THROUGH A GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, HAD BEEN </p><p>ARRIVED AT BY OUR USUAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, </p><p>INVOLVING VARIOUS OFFICES IN WASHINGTON (AID, STATE, </p><p>COMMERCE, AGRICULTURE, THE CONGRESS) AS WELL AS THE </p><p>EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE DCM THEN CONTINUED THAT ANY INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>WHEAT SITUATION IN LEBANON IS MOST WELCOME.  HE STATED </p><p>THAT OUR CURRENT FOOD ASSISTANCE TO LEBANON IS CHANNELED </p><p>THROUGH PRIVATE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\'S WEAKNESSES.  HE UNDERLINED THAT THE </p><p>PVO\'S SEEM THE BEST VEHICLES TO ENSURE THAT OUR </p><p>ASSISTANCE REACHES NEEDY LEBANESE, REGARDLESS OF CON- </p><p>FESSION.  AMONG THE QUESTIONS DEBATED IN CONSIDERING </p><p>WHEAT FOR LEBANON, THE DCM EXPLAINED, WERE EQUITABLE </p><p>DISTRIBUTION, BREAD SMUGGLING OR "EXPORTS" TO NEIGHBORING </p><p>COUNTRIES AND REFORM OF THE GOL\'S BREAD SUBSIDY.  DCM </p><p>MADE IT CLEAR THAT BY "EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION" WE MEAN </p><p>HONEST DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITHOUT </p><p>REGARD TO CONFESSION AND WITHOUT MILITIA INVOLVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  SALLOUKH RESPONDED THAT THE SUBSIDY MIGHT BE </p><p>REDUCED, BUT SAID THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE </p><p>"GRADUALLY," GIVEN THE CURRENT PUBLIC PRESSURE OVER </p><p>SALARY INCREASES AND THE PERCEIVED HIGH COST OF LIVING. </p><p>THIS DECISION IS "POLITICAL," HE DECLARED.  DCM REPLIED </p><p>THAT WE ESTIMATED THE BREAD SUBSIDY TO COST THE GOL </p><p>USD 38.7 MILLION PER YEAR IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND </p><p>STRESSED OUR WORLDWIDE POLICY INTEREST IN REFORMS DIRECTE </p><p>TOWARD MORE OPEN MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMIC POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  REGARDING BREAD EXPORTS, SALLOUKH CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THIS PROBLEM IS "NOT AS DANGEROUS AS IMAGINED," </p><p>HE DID NOT DENY THAT BREAD IS BEING SENT ABROAD. </p><p>"FRANKLY SPEAKING," SALLOUKH SAID HE IS AWARE THAT THERE </p><p>ARE TAXI DRIVERS DRIVING FROM LEBANON TO DAMASCUS WITH </p><p>5 KILOS OF LEBANESE BREAD WHO MAY GIVE ONE KILO AT THE </p><p>BORDER TO SYRIAN OFFICIALS TO FACILITATE CROSSING. </p><p>HE ALSO THOUGHT SOME LEBANESE BREAD GOES TO CYPRUS, </p><p>BUT IS ONLY CONSUMED BY LEBANESE RESIDENT THERE, "A </p><p>SMALL NUMBER."  REGARDING SMUGGLING TO ISRAEL, SALLOUKH </p><p>THOUGHT IT NON-EXISTENT.  IN TOTALY, SALLOUKH ESTIMATED </p><p>THE TOTAL BREAD DIVERTED FROM LEBANON AT NO MORE THAN </p><p>5, AND PROBABLY CLOSER TO 1 PERCENT OF THETOTAL </p><p>PRODUCED, NOT THE 25 PERCENT SOMETIMES CITED.  WE </p><p>LISTENED BUT DID NOT AGREE, INDICATING INTEREST IN ANY </p><p>INFORMATION SALLOUKH COULD PROVIDE IN THAT REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>10. ON DISTRIBUTION, SALLOUKH THOUGHT MOST AID TO </p><p>LEBANON IS NOT HANDLED AS IT SHOULD BE.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>SAUDI ASSISTANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, HAD BEEN HANDED-OUT </p><p>LOCALLY, REGARDLESS OF INCOME LEVEL; ALL 23 FAMILIES </p><p>IN HIS APARTMENT BUILDING WERE OFFERED KING FAHD FOOD </p><p>PACKAGES.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIS FAMILY AND TWO </p><p>RELATIVES LIVING IN THE SAME BUILDING, THE TWENTY </p><p>OTHERS ACCEPTED THE AID, THOUGH NOT IN NEED.  SALLOUKH </p><p>BELIEVED MALDISTRIBUTION EXISTS IN OTHER FOREIGN </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO LEBANON AND FOR THAT MATTER </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  SALLOUKH CONTENDED THAT COMPARED </p><p>TO OTHER COUNTRIES RECEIVING U.S. WHEAT, DISTRIBUTION </p><p>AND SMUGGLING WOULD BE NO WORSE IF NOT SLIGHTLY LESS </p><p>OF A PROBLEM IN LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE DCM STATED THAT THE USG WAS NOT ONLY </p><p>CONSIDERING GIVING LEBANON WHEAT, BUT IS ALSO VERY </p><p>INTERESTED IN SELLING IT AS WELL.  HE POINTED TO </p><p>OUR STRONG DESIRE TO COMPETE FOR GOL WHEAT TENDERS </p><p>UNDER OUR EEP PROGRAM AND THE NEED TO GIVE AMPLE </p><p>NOTICE TO U.S. EXPORTERS, CITING THE MOST RECENT </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN REFTEL.  (GOL INFORMED US--DELIBERATELY </p><p>LATE--THAT IT HAD OPENED THE TENDER ON MARCH 28, WITH </p><p>A DEADLINE OF MARCH 30.)  SALLOUKH SAID HE WOULD </p><p>RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH MINISTER QASSIR IN THEIR UPCOMING </p><p>MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  COMMENT:  WE BELIEVE SALLOUKH IS SINCERE IN HIS </p><p>PLEDGE TO RAISE THE WHEAT TENDER ISSUE WITH QASSIR. </p><p>WE WOULD, HOWEVER, BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IF THIS </p><p>RESULTS IN A REAL OPENING FOR U.S. EXPORTERS, GIVEN </p><p>ALLEGATIONS  THAT QASSIR  HIMSELF BENEFITS </p><p>FROM THE TRANSACTION AS IT OCCURS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  BIO DATA:  AMBASSADOR SALLOUKH, TWENTY-EIGHT YEAR </p><p>VETERAN OF THE MFA, APPEARS TO BE IN HIS EARLY TO </p><p>MID FIFTIES.  HE IS A SHI\'ITE MUSLIM FROM BETWEEN </p><p>ALEY AND SOUK-EL-GHARB IN THE SHOUF MOUNTAINS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>HE HAS SERVED THREE MONTHS AS MFA ECONOMIC AFFAIRS </p><p>DIRECTOR, HE ALREADY SEEMS MORE ON TOP OF THE JOB THAN </p><p>HIS PREDECESSOR GEORGE KHOURY, WHO HAD BEEN THERE </p><p>ONE AND A HALF YEARS AND IS NOW OFF TO SANAA.  MOST OF </p><p>SALLOUKH\'S YEARS ABROAD HAVE BEEN SPENT IN THE AFRICAN </p><p>CONTINENT:  2 YEARS IN LIBERIA, 7 IN SIERRA LEONE, 9 </p><p>IN NIGERIA AND 4 IN ALGIERS.  FOR THE SAKE OF HIS </p><p>CHILDREN\'S EDUCATION, MANY OF THOSE YEARS HAVE BEEN </p><p>SPENT WITHOUT HIS WIFE, DAUGHTER AND 2 SONS WHO </p><p>REMAINED IN LEBANON.  SALLOUKH SAYS HE HAS KNOWN </p><p>MANY AMERICAN AMBASSADORS, MOST RECENTLY AMBASSADOR </p><p>JOHNSTONE. </p><p> </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
