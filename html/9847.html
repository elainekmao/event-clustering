<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001327 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MASS, MOPS, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO\'S LIBERIA POLICY GETS MIXED </p><p>REVIEWS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA NI 1317 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By Charge Dawn Liberi. Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) President Obasanjo\'s policy of active </p><p>diplomatic engagement on and military troop deployment </p><p>to Liberia has the support of the many Nigerians who </p><p>believe that their country\'s status as the sub- </p><p>regional power requires an activist foreign policy. </p><p>However, most Nigerians probably either oppose or are </p><p>negatively indifferent to Obasanjo\'s Liberia policy. </p><p>The asylum offer to President Taylor has attracted the </p><p>brunt of this expostulation but significant media </p><p>criticism also has been directed at the imminent troop </p><p>deployment.  Recalling the prolonged and often trying </p><p>ECOMOG experiment in Liberia, politicians on both </p><p>sides of the aisle have questioned the wisdom of </p><p>returning Nigeria troops so soon to Liberia.  Credible </p><p>sources indicate that elements in the senior ranks of </p><p>the military strongly oppose deployment to Liberia. </p><p>Despite this opposition, President Obasanjo will be </p><p>able to carry out his policy, but not without some </p><p>political opposition and some temporizing by his </p><p>military brass.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>WEST AFRICA: PAX NIGERIANA? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Obasanjo\'s readiness to play the leading role </p><p>in Liberia is based on his personal belief that West </p><p>Africa is Nigeria\'s backyard; that Nigeria has the </p><p>right and responsibility to deal with any troubled </p><p>turf within the confines of this sub-regional fence. </p><p>Many influential opinion-makers inside and outside of </p><p>government share this view and have publicly supported </p><p>Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While there is an inchoate national consensus </p><p>that Nigeria generally should take a leading role in </p><p>sub-regional and continental affairs, the country is </p><p>much more politically divided over the President\'s </p><p>actual Liberia policy.  This is the most dominant and </p><p>controversial foreign policy issue so far this year </p><p>and opposition to Obasanjo\'s initiatives has been </p><p>tangible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Some pundits complain that Nigeria has too </p><p>many internal problems to exert itself in Liberia at </p><p>this time.  They see the Liberian exercise as a costly </p><p>expenditure of resources better used addressing </p><p>challenges much more local.  After having undergone a </p><p>painful and costly eight-year deployment in Liberia, </p><p>many people are afraid that this deployment would </p><p>similarly mire Nigeria.  More sophisticated observers </p><p>are apprehensive that a protracted stay or failure in </p><p>Liberia will dull foreign policy activism and </p><p>encourage a more passive isolationist sentiment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>NO WELCOME WAGON FOR TAYLOR </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Most Nigerians oppose the Taylor exile offer; </p><p>some are viscerally against it.  The reasons are </p><p>several.  After hosting Roosevelt and Prince Johnson, </p><p>Nigeria has taken in their share of Liberian </p><p>misanthropes; there is no stomach now to host the </p><p>worst of the lot.  During his heyday as warlord and </p><p>President, Taylor specialized in public broadcasts </p><p>that degenerated into either anti-American or anti- </p><p>Nigerian diatribes.  Taylor\'s forces were also known </p><p>to have brutally killed several Nigerians, including </p><p>two journalists, simply because of their nationality. </p><p>Thus, Nigerian journalists who remember these acts </p><p>have turned their pens and typewriters against asylum </p><p>for Taylor, arguing that Nigeria should be the last </p><p>country to give Taylor safe haven given his Nigeria- </p><p>bashing antecedents.  Last, many people fear Taylor is </p><p>incorrigible and that he would bring his penchant for </p><p>destabilization to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)(Comment: During a recent visit to Cross River </p><p>State, Charge was told by Cross River Governor Duke </p><p>that preparations were quickly being made for Taylor\'s </p><p>arrival in Calabar.  Duke admitted however that </p><p>Taylor\'s advance team found the accommodations too </p><p>modest.  When Taylor\'s people asked to purchase </p><p>additional land, Duke said he refused because Taylor </p><p>would only be in Calabar for six months.  There was no </p><p>need for him to become a landholder in Calabar for </p><p>such a short duration.  This begs a question.  Where </p><p>do the Nigerians plan to move Taylor after six months? </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>THE ARMY: NO LOVE FOR THIS DEPLOYMENT </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S)  While attracting less resentment than the </p><p>Taylor asylum, Obasanjo\'s troop deployment decision </p><p>does not have unalloyed support either.  Predictably, </p><p>most opposition politicians are against it.  Some </p><p>members of the President\'s own party even have </p><p>questioned whether the President is leaning too far </p><p>forward.  Unfortunately, perhaps the strongest </p><p>opposition may be in the military itself.  Two </p><p>experienced West African journalists who have covered </p><p>the Liberian beat for over a decade have told us that </p><p>the overwhelming majority of Nigerians officers who </p><p>served in Liberia under ECOMOG bitterly oppose the new </p><p>deployment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S/NF)  These veteran reporters have decided not to </p><p>publish this story because of its sensitivity. </p><p>However, they stated that most officers fear that the </p><p>Liberian factions are still not convinced to take the </p><p>road toward peace and that the Nigerian forces will </p><p>neither be given the clear mandate nor the operational </p><p>wherewithal to forcibly escort the recalcitrant </p><p>Liberians down the irenic path.  Thus, they foresee </p><p>their soldiers getting bogged down in a tense </p><p>environment while hamstrung by an ambiguous mandate. </p><p>We also know from previous discussions with President </p><p>Obasanjo, that Chief of Defense Staff Ogomudia has </p><p>been lukewarm, at best, to this deployment.  DAO </p><p>reporting also indicates significant senior level </p><p>reticence to the planned deployment. (Ref. A) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  On the other hand, in a show of support and </p><p>party solidarity, the PDP-dominated Senate assented to </p><p>the troop deployment but conditioned its approval on </p><p>the provision of adequate logistical support from </p><p>international donors.  Under Nigerian constitutional </p><p>law, it is still unsettled whether Obasanjo needs </p><p>legislative approval before deploying.  Most scholars </p><p>believe he does, however, Obasanjo has given short </p><p>shrift to the Constitution in the past when it suited </p><p>his purpose.  He will likely do the same this time. </p><p>Yet, because of the political friction he has been </p><p>experiencing, he may have to take steps that give the </p><p>appearance of meeting the Senate conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  President Obasanjo has basically staked out a </p><p>position on Liberia consonant with USG interests. </p><p>This position is perhaps as forward leaning as </p><p>possible in Nigeria\'s current political climate. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s stance has not come without political costs </p><p>and he has reacted.  His acerbic July 30 comments </p><p>criticizing the USG for not being sufficiently engaged </p><p>were likely the result of his frustration at having </p><p>staked out what he saw as an enlightened policy, only </p><p>to become the recipient of some tough domestic </p><p>criticism for doing too much and of international </p><p>criticism for moving too slowly.  Nevertheless, </p><p>Obasanjo is in control of Nigeria\'s foreign policy and </p><p>his basic strategy on Liberia will not change. </p><p>However, he probably will have to alternatively cajole </p><p>and hector his reluctant military bureaucracy to march </p><p>to his tune. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
