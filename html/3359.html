<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002171 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FAILED PDP PRIMARY INDICATES MORE THAN </p><p>PARTY STRIFE FOR NIGERIAN ELECTORAL PROCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Many states delayed PDP primaries slated for </p><p>early July for fear of violence.  Violent disturbances marred </p><p>the primaries that did go forward; Post sources could verify </p><p>peaceful primaries in only four states.  Vice President Atiku </p><p>Abubakar indicated that agreements aimed at limiting violence </p><p>within and between parties are being struck. Even days after </p><p>the primaries, it is difficult to give a detailed account of </p><p>what transpired as the situation in many areas remains </p><p>uncertain.  However, this message attempts to give a </p><p>representative sampling of what we have learned thus far. </p><p>Clearly the PDP is a fragmented machine and its inability to </p><p>conduct credible party primaries indicates continued trouble </p><p>for the electoral process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>PDP Primary </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) PDP primaries held in early July turned violent in </p><p>much of the country. Rioting, property damage, bodily injury </p><p>and deaths were reported in several states. A number of </p><p>states postponed the primaries in all or large portions of </p><p>their territory in anticipation of trouble. Other states </p><p>called off primaries when clashes between party factions </p><p>erupted in violence too difficult to control. Primaries were </p><p>successfully completed without violence in Zamfara, Sokoto, </p><p>Borno and Jigawa State.  Primaries were not held in Katsina </p><p>State, Sokoto State, Abia State or Plateau State. In Plateau </p><p>State, a scene of earlier PDP factional violence, the primary </p><p>was postponed following an ethnic clash that occurred on the </p><p>previous weekend; ultimately, Plateau chose its candidates by </p><p>consensus, except for three of the most volatile LGAs in Jos </p><p>itself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In Taraba State, two persons were reported killed and </p><p>10 injured in election related violence. In the comparatively </p><p>calm Federal Capital Territory (FCT), only three of six </p><p>councils were able to complete the exercise. In Kaduna State, </p><p>rival candidates are rumored to be solving their differences </p><p>prior to the primary by agreeing on a consensus candidate. </p><p>The state party had hoped to head off potential violence in </p><p>this manner. However, Kaduna State later moved ahead with its </p><p>primaries, which became marred by violence with 15 persons </p><p>reportedly killed.  An Embassy FSN witnessed several persons </p><p>in Kwara State being taken into police custody, with what </p><p>appeared to be knife and other injuries in primary-related </p><p>violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In Delta State, widespread violence on June 30 caused </p><p>the postponement of the July 1 caucus. Two people reportedly </p><p>died while seven persons sustained serious injuries. Police </p><p>have arrested at least 40 rioters for electoral violence and </p><p>illegal possession of arms. In Rivers State, the primary was </p><p>halted and rescheduled for July 9 in four councils due to </p><p>violence. On July 9, violence marred the rescheduled primary, </p><p>and many persons reportedly fled to Port Harcourt or remained </p><p>in their homes. According to reports, over 100 were left </p><p>homeless after their homes were destroyed by rioters.  In </p><p>Bayelsa State 4-8 people lost their lives killed during the </p><p>primary violence and at least 15 people were seriously </p><p>injured. Twelve houses were set ablaze. Imo State PDP </p><p>conducted its primaries July 5.  Approximately 20 were </p><p>injured and several incidents of vandalism and arson were </p><p>reported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The party in Edo State completed the primary with </p><p>credible results; however, some local chapters of the PDP </p><p>lodged complaints at the party secretariat alleging gross </p><p>irregularities in the primary process. There were reports </p><p>that thousands of protestors disrupted the primaries in </p><p>several wards. In Ogun State, aggrieved members of the party </p><p>have also lodged several complaints at the party secretariat. </p><p>The Oyo state PDP congress was moved to Abuja after a failed </p><p>attempt to hold it in Ibadan. Many aspirants have complained </p><p>of manipulation and unfair use of executive power in Adamawa </p><p>State.  Aspirants and their supporters have protested the use </p><p>of minors and bribery to manipulate primary results. The </p><p>State PDP Chairman stunned journalists when asked to comment </p><p>on the alleged "rigging or irregularities".  Chief Joel </p><p>Madaki stated, "Rigging is a nice word.  I like it.  It is </p><p>acceptable in politics." In Kano State many candidates </p><p>reported irregularities and have threatened to leave the PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Failed and Postponed Primaries not Surprising </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) In late June, PDP Chairman Audu Ogbeh told the DCM </p><p>that he feared for Nigeria because the country\'s productive </p><p>economy was in ruins and the only thing left for people to </p><p>"do" was politics. Given the PDP\'s track record, Ogbeh </p><p>doubted the PDP primaries would be free of violence in very </p><p>many places.  He stated that Governors were trying to force </p><p>through lists that favored them, even though primaries had </p><p>not been held. (Note: The governors are not the only ones, </p><p>lists coming from Aso Rock also add to the tension.  End </p><p>Note.) Ogbeh said he told several governors that he would </p><p>simply substitute in other names if he thought they were </p><p>playing tricks; as Party Chairman he had the authority to </p><p>certify the party\'s candidates.  (Note: This so-called fix </p><p>has its flaws. Not only is it arbitrary, previous past PDP </p><p>chairmen reportedly made money from the practice of changing </p><p>lists). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) A PDP member of the National Assembly told Poloffs </p><p>that the primary in Anambra State was marred by cheating. </p><p>The Representative stated that he witnessed "open ballot" </p><p>voting for local government candidates in one ward that </p><p>produced an undisputed winner, only to find that the defeated </p><p>contestant had emerged victorious when the results were </p><p>compiled at the state level. He claimed similar chicanery was </p><p>practiced throughout the state. Dr. C.P. Eziefe, former </p><p>Anambra State governor and currently a Special Advisor to the </p><p>President, told Polcouns that candidates in the PDP primaries </p><p>in Abuja had bussed people from outside the capital to skew </p><p>the election results.  In Bayelsa State, he claimed the </p><p>governor had issued an ultimatum to all LGA contestants: He </p><p>had already selected who would win the nomination, thus there </p><p>was no need to run against his handpicked choices.  To soften </p><p>the blow, the governor offered to compensate the losers for </p><p>their campaign expenses if they agreed to drop out of the </p><p>race before the primary.  Those with the temerity to continue </p><p>against the governor\'s wishes, would have to swallow their </p><p>loss and well as their own expenses. Ezeife contended that </p><p>the party\'s national executive committee, itself a victim of </p><p>internecine fighting, was too divided and overwhelmed to </p><p>prevent these transgressions from happening right under their </p><p>noses in the nation\'s capital let alone in more distant </p><p>places. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Perhaps most disturbing of all, a group of Northern </p><p>elder statesmen, whose political careers date back to the </p><p>First Republic, recently told the Ambassador that political </p><p>divisions in Nigeria are greater now than at any time in </p><p>their collective memories.  In 2003 they expected a </p><p>conflagration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Party primaries were fraught with intrigue, </p><p>discrepancies and outright cheating. There are several </p><p>reasons for this. As Minister of Defense and PDP king maker </p><p>Danjuma recently told the Ambassador, the PDP is perceived to </p><p>be so dominant in many states that winning the primary is </p><p>tantamount to capturing the general election.  Thus, the </p><p>competition in the primaries in these areas has been as keen </p><p>as what would be expected in the final inter-party </p><p>competition. Thus, as a general rule, there was probably more </p><p>upheaval in those areas where the PDP believes it is the </p><p>strongest party. Second, there is the tenuous nature of the </p><p>PDP itself. Despite some efforts by PDP Chairman Ogbeh and </p><p>others to instill discipline and propriety, the PDP has very </p><p>little cohesion.  In fact, the PDP is not a political party </p><p>in the traditional sense, but a loose confederation of very </p><p>disparate groups.  Too many of the PDP\'s members see the </p><p>party as a platform to promote and maximize their personal </p><p>interests not as a party to which they owe allegiance. </p><p>Instead of following the party, they believe the party should </p><p>follow them.  This led to relatively unbridled competition in </p><p>some areas where contestants tried to out-cheat the other. </p><p>This lack of restraint inexorably invited violence. Third, </p><p>there is common belief among those seeking national as well </p><p>as gubernatorial seats that placing allies in local </p><p>government is an essential building-block to their electoral </p><p>victory. Therefore, contestants for larger offices used the </p><p>local primaries as a type of proxy battle.  Last and most </p><p>fundamentally, a great number of politicians do not value the </p><p>democratic process. The will of the voter comes in second to </p><p>the wishes of the "big man."  Sadly, the political system is </p><p>weak and cannot correct itself easily; thus, misconduct </p><p>cascades. The minute one person misbehaves, others respond in </p><p>kind; honesty puts one at a severe competitive disadvantage </p><p>since there is little chance misconduct will be punished. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment continued.  Flawed and unseemly, the PDP </p><p>primaries highlight the major problems in Nigerian electoral </p><p>politics.  It is a zero-sum, winner-take-all gambit that no </p><p>one wants to lose. As such, it is a harbinger, indeed a </p><p>warning of the difficulties that lay ahead for the general </p><p>elections.  Hopefully, the impact of the PDP primaries will </p><p>register on sober minds in all the parties, the electoral </p><p>commission, and the security forces so that they will begin </p><p>to take steps that curb violence.  However, the reality is </p><p>that as long as many political practitioners see politics as </p><p>an "all-or- nothing" affair, unruly competition and some </p><p>level of violence will occasion most electoral contests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
