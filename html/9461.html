<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004416 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>OPIC FOR WILLIAMS/KIWAN </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA -- ABIGAIL DEMOPULOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EINV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ RECEPTIVE TO OPIC SOVEREIGN DEBT FACILITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) AMMAN 3988 B) AMMAN 0332 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY ECON IAN CAMPBELL EO 12959 REASONS 1.5 B AND D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: OPIC Director for Insurance for Africa and </p><p>the Middle East Jim Williams  and Citibank executives met </p><p>with King Abdullah, GOJ officials, and representatives of </p><p>Bechtel July 13 to discuss potential OPIC support for a </p><p>variety of infrastructure projects in Jordan.  While a number </p><p>of potential projects were discussed, a plan to enhance port </p><p>and tourist facilities in the Aqaba Special Economic Zone </p><p>(ASEZA) seemed to garner the most interest from the King and </p><p>the GOJ in matching OPIC products to Jordan\'s current needs. </p><p>Accordingly, a proposal from ASEZA project manager Bechtel </p><p>that draws on OPIC\'s Nonhonoring of Sovereign Guarantee </p><p>Insurance partnered with competitive financing offered by </p><p>Citibank and assuages an impatient King eager to see progress </p><p>in Aqaba should be before the Cabinet by the first week of </p><p>August.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>FINANCING NOT TIED TO U.S. PROCUREMENT </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Following up on interest expressed by the GOJ </p><p>during discussions held in January (REF B), Williams, </p><p>Citigroup Vice Chairman for Corporate and Investment Bank </p><p>Anthony Nelson, and Citibank Jordan CEO Suhair al-Ali held a </p><p>series of meetings July 13 with various GOJ officials, </p><p>including King Abdullah, Minister of Planning Awadallah, </p><p>Minister of Water Nasser, and ASEZA Chief Biltaji.  The </p><p>purpose of the meetings, which also included representatives </p><p>of Bechtel, was to discuss possible OPIC support for a </p><p>variety of projects in Jordan.  Along the lines of the </p><p>January meetings, the talks focused on OPIC\'s political risk </p><p>program, especially its "Nonhonoring of Sovereign Guarantee </p><p>Insurance," a new OPIC product.  Eligibility for the </p><p>insurance is predicated on the provision of at least 25% </p><p>project financing by a U.S. bank, hence the participation of </p><p>Citibank, the only U.S. bank in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) While the facility could provide up to $400 million </p><p>for infrastructure projects in the Kingdom, there is a per </p><p>project limit of $250 million.  The package, jointly offered </p><p>by Citibank and OPIC, would include up to fifteen year </p><p>financing, low U.S. Treasury rates, and AAA pricing with </p><p>narrow spreads (U.S. Treasury plus 100 basis points).  The </p><p>package is not tied to U.S. procurement. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>GET MOVING ON AQABA </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Accompanied by Ambassador Gnehm, Williams and the </p><p>Citigroup team met with King Abdullah, Royal Court Minster </p><p>Faisal Fayez, and Minster Awadallah.  Williams said he </p><p>thought the King was enthusiastic about the opportunity </p><p>provided by the OPIC product.  He added that, during a </p><p>discussion about possible applications of the financing for </p><p>Aqaba development, the King registered his impatience with </p><p>Bechtel, Master Developer and Contractor for the ASEZA, and </p><p>said "they have to move things along". </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Williams said Awadallah was "championing", within </p><p>the GOJ, Citibank project financing that made use of the OPIC </p><p>sovereign debt insurance.  While a number of projects were </p><p>discussed that were candidates for such an arrangement, Aqaba </p><p>development emerged as a priority.  Williams said there were </p><p>two pre-requisites for Citibank to get a mandate to go </p><p>forward.  Bechtel has two weeks to provide the details </p><p>(scope, financial projections, etc.) for whatever projects it </p><p>is recommending for Aqaba.  In addition, the Cabinet needs to </p><p>authorize the formation of the Aqaba Development Company, </p><p>which would be the privatized entity responsible for the </p><p>contracting of future development projects within the Zone. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Williams noted that Minister of Finance Marto, who </p><p>had previously expressed concern that the IMF might consider </p><p>the OPIC insurance part of Jordan\'s sovereign debt (REF B), </p><p>was not in attendance in any of the meetings, giving rise to </p><p>disappointment and concern on the part of Citibank.  However, </p><p>Ministry of Finance Secretary General Hammour attended a </p><p>meeting with the team at the Ministry of Planning, and seemed </p><p>"receptive and open" to the proposal. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) While the GOJ will certainly give strong </p><p>consideration to reservations held by the IMF and other </p><p>like-minded institutions regarding Jordan\'s taking on </p><p>something that may resemble additional sovereign debt, it </p><p>appears as though momentum within the GOJ currently favors </p><p>the Citibank facility insured by OPIC.  At the end of the </p><p>day, the support of the King, impatient for discernible </p><p>progress on the Aqaba development front and on financial </p><p>terms some of his advisors see as favorable, may seal the </p><p>deal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
