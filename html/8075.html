<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 003197 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, OREP, PGOV, PREL, TU, US </p><p>SUBJECT: HIGHLIGHTS OF APRIL 27-29 CODEL WEXLER </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 102777 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  During an April 27-29 visit to Ankara, </p><p>Representative Robert </p><p>Wexler visited with senior GOT leadership to assure continued </p><p>support for </p><p>the U.S.-Turkish relationship while simultaneously </p><p>acknowledging there had been </p><p>recent differences between the two countries. To mitigate any </p><p>possible residual </p><p>disappointment that could occur as a result of the Turkish </p><p>parliament\'s </p><p>decision not to support coalition efforts in Iraq, the </p><p>Congressman urged the </p><p>GOT leadership to demonstrate both substantive and symbolic </p><p>gestures to the </p><p>U.S. Congress to reaffirm this relationship.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Representative Robert Wexler,s Message </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Congressman Robert Wexler began his meetings with the </p><p>GOT </p><p>leadership by delivering a good news/bad news message.  First </p><p>the good news: </p><p>the first full House of Representatives debate on </p><p>Turkish-American relations in </p><p>memory (over the $1 billion supplemental grant) had come out </p><p>three to one in </p><p>Turkey\'s favor despite its taking place at the height of </p><p>bilateral tensions. </p><p>Then the bad: there was great disappointment with Turkey </p><p>within the U.S. </p><p>administration, and many questioned Turkey\'s overall policy </p><p>direction. </p><p>Throughout his meetings Wexler affirmed "Nothing is more </p><p>important right now </p><p>than continued good relations between Turkey and the U.S.  He </p><p>stressed that </p><p>Turkey must be pro-active in reinvigorating the relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Prime Minister Tayyip Recip Erdogan </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Prime Minister Erdogan emphasized the importance of </p><p>Turkey\'s "strategic </p><p>partnership" with the U.S.  In a long defense, Erdogan (1) </p><p>expressed regret </p><p>that the U.S. Congress had reacted so emotionally; (2) </p><p>claimed that, after the </p><p>U.K., Turkey gave the U.S. more support than anyone else on </p><p>Iraq, including </p><p>allowing Operation Northern Watch to continue for years and </p><p>permitting U.S. </p><p>special operations forces to enter Iraq through Turkey; (3) </p><p>recalled that the </p><p>GOT had warned the USG that it would be hard to pass the </p><p>troop deployment </p><p>resolution; and (4) averred that AK M.P.s were negatively </p><p>affected by </p><p>"insulting" anti-Turkish cartoons in the U.S. press.  In the </p><p>end, Turkey\'s </p><p>opening of its airspace -- which the GOT allowed because it </p><p>was a requirement </p><p>of its alliance with the U.S. -- was more significant than </p><p>similar moves by </p><p>Germany or Romania.  Now Turkey wanted to establish a common </p><p>approach with the </p><p>U.S. to help Iraq become a democracy. Moreover, AK party\'s </p><p>parliamentary </p><p>members had a positive attitude toward the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>General Staff DCHOD Buyukanit </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Under questioning from Wexler, DCHOD Buyukanit </p><p>admitted that mil-mil </p><p>relations were not as solid as previously.  He argued weakly </p><p>that the military </p><p>had worked for parliamentary passage of the bill to support </p><p>U.S. combat </p><p>operations, claiming the military could not impose its will </p><p>on Parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Buyukanit claimed that misunderstandings between </p><p>Turkey and the U.S. had </p><p>arisen from "wrong assessments" the U.S. military had sent to </p><p>Washington, but </p><p>the Turkish military would now do its best to create a new </p><p>atmosphere for the </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Buyukanit then listed Turkish concerns related to </p><p>Iraq:  (1) The Kurds </p><p>could not be trusted; (2) The Iraqi Shi,a were a </p><p>second-class majority who now </p><p>wanted a major role; (3) Turkey did not have designs on </p><p>Kirkuk or Mosul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) FonMin Gul stated there were disappointments and </p><p>misunderstandings on </p><p>both sides.  Claiming he was disappointed in the result of </p><p>the </p><p>resolution, Gul opined that Turkey did not cooperate fully, </p><p>but it did </p><p>cooperate.  Public opinion was strongly against the war. </p><p>Secretary Powell,s </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>visit was helpful. Turkey and the U.S. are "indispensable </p><p>partners."  This is </p><p>not only the view of the government, the man on the street </p><p>feels this way as </p><p>well.  The (March 1) resolution is not the only indicator of </p><p>Turkish sentiment. </p><p>There is no turning back on our pro-U.S., pro-E.U. policy. </p><p>Except for that </p><p>resolution, we (AK) have made progress on these fronts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) As for relations with Turkey\'s eastern neighbors, Gul </p><p>asserted that </p><p>Turkey will influence them, not vice versa.  Regarding Iran, </p><p>Iraq and Syria, </p><p>Gul claimed "they cannot give Turkey anything; Turkey can </p><p>give them something. </p><p>Turkey has had problems with them in the past and is only </p><p>trying to improve </p><p>relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Gul concluded by promising to follow up with a visit </p><p>of parliamentarians </p><p>to the U.S. Congress and to assure significant AK party </p><p>representation on </p><p>Parliament\'s Turkish-American Friendship Committee.  He noted </p><p>the Israeli </p><p>President is planning to visit Turkey soon and that Turkey </p><p>supported the Middle </p><p>East roadmap and will contribute to peace in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>MFA - Ambassador Ugur Ziyal </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Under Secretary </p><p>Ambassador Ziyal commented </p><p>that many in the GOT incorrectly assumed the problems had </p><p>passed and noted the </p><p>U.S.-Turkish military relationship must be repaired. On the </p><p>future of Iraq, he </p><p>stressed, the U.S. and Turkey need to consult and work </p><p>closely.  Observing the </p><p>U.S. and Turkey have gone through worse crises before, and </p><p>will weather this </p><p>one, Ziyal confessed he is at a loss as to what Turkey can do </p><p>right now. </p><p>He wondered about a trip to Washington but asked how such a </p><p>delegation would be </p><p>received. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Ziyal dismissed concerns about the Turkmen, saying </p><p>they are not </p><p>warlike; they are doctors and tradesmen and will add to peace </p><p>and stability. </p><p>He thought it important to prevent Kurd-Arab clashes as well </p><p>as to fight the </p><p>PKK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Wexler advised a well-coordinated parliamentary trip </p><p>with the right </p><p>message would be helpful and suggested that a visit to Israel </p><p>by the FM and/or </p><p>PM would also help. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Central Bank Governor Sureyya Serdengecti </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Central Bank Governor Sureyya Serdengecti told </p><p>Congressman Wexler that </p><p>the AK government had taken office ill-prepared to address </p><p>Turkey\'s economic </p><p>problems, and its learning curve had been longer than </p><p>expected.  After a brief </p><p>post-election boost, confidence fell in December-February in </p><p>the face of the </p><p>government\'s lack of enthusiasm for reform and growing </p><p>concerns about an Iraq </p><p>operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The key issue, according to Serdengecti, is whether </p><p>there will be </p><p>sufficient political support to stick to the reform program, </p><p>and an absence of </p><p>political friction that could undermine confidence.  While </p><p>the Prime Minister </p><p>and some others in the Party now have a better understanding </p><p>of the need for </p><p>the IMF program, others in AK do not.  Moreover, there are </p><p>other "power groups" </p><p>in the country that oppose economic stabilization efforts </p><p>because they want to </p><p>see AK suffer and fall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Serdengecti concluded by arguing that he and other </p><p>technocrats had to </p><p>convince the government (and the rest of the state) of the </p><p>need to stick with </p><p>the reform program and to continue to move closer to the </p><p>West.  On the economy, </p><p>he told PM Erdogan a week ago that the government could not </p><p>make any more </p><p>mistakes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Parliamentary Meetings </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Wexler met with representatives of the Turkish </p><p>Parliament\'s Foreign </p><p>Affairs Committee and the U.S.-Turkish Friendship Committee, </p><p>whose leadership </p><p>consists entirely of CHP parliamentarians who had voted </p><p>against the March 1 </p><p>resolution.  Interlocutors included AKP MP and Foreign </p><p>Affairs Committee chair </p><p>Mehmet Dulger, CHP MP AND retired AMB Onur Oymen, and Foreign </p><p>Affairs Committee </p><p>staffer Osman Ulukan.  Chairman Dulger thanked Wexler for his </p><p>visit, saying, </p><p>"Ours is a lasting friendship.  Any misunderstandings should </p><p>be lifted."  Dulger </p><p>advised shaping public opinion in Turkey and the U.S. in a </p><p>positive way, noting "We </p><p>do not want to give the impression to the Turkish people that </p><p>Turkey-U.S. ties are </p><p>weak.  Ambassador Oymen followed, asserting that there is no </p><p>anti-American feeling </p><p>in CHP.  Oymen applauded Wexler,s suggestion that Parliament </p><p>demonstrate a show of </p><p>support, while cautioning that it is not difficult to </p><p>persuade Turkey, but you </p><p>cannot force Turkey to do anything. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
