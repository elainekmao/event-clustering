<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000830 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND INL </p><p>DOJ FOR ICITAP--BARR/BEINHART </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PGOV, ASEC, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: INITIAL TAKE ON NEW POLICE CHIEF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 823 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) LEGATT and RNLEO paid an introductory call on new </p><p>Inspector General of Police Tafa Balogun March 13 at Police </p><p>Headquarters in Abuja.  Balogun received the Embassy visitors </p><p>warmly and promised a strong and productive working </p><p>relationship with U.S. law enforcement agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) Balogun, only three days on the job, already seemed </p><p>to be gaining command of his brief.  He lamented, however, </p><p>that he could not yet introduce his team of Deputy Inspectors </p><p>General (DIGs) since they have not yet been officially </p><p>appointed (with portfolios).  RNLEO voiced the Ambassador\'s </p><p>desired to meet with the IGP at his earliest convenience; </p><p>Balogun welcomed the opportunity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) LEGATT called attention to the various training </p><p>courses the FBI and other U.S. law enforcement agencies offer </p><p>the Nigerian Police Force with INL funding and highlighted </p><p>two upcoming courses:  Community Policing and and </p><p>Preservation of Crime Scene Evidence.  Balogun expressed </p><p>appreciation for the USG\'s provision of technical assistance </p><p>and training to the NPF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) Noting Balogun\'s March 11 visit to Lagos and his </p><p>public pledges of police reform made during that visit, RNLEO </p><p>asked the IGP for his priorities in the coming months. </p><p>Balogun stated that he has an eight-point strategy to address </p><p>the severe problems facing the Nigeria police: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A) Address the rise in armed robberies and violent attacks on </p><p>police using a "fire-with-fire" approach; </p><p>B) improving the conflict management skills of the police; </p><p>C) Design a comprehensive training programe, conducive for </p><p>"qualitative policing," for all levels of police; </p><p>D) launch an aggressive anti-corruption campaign within and </p><p>outside of the police force; </p><p>E) carry out a "robust" public relations campaign designed to </p><p>promote an image of the "people\'s police;" </p><p>F) Strengthen the Community-Police Partnership using the </p><p>modern model used throughout the world; </p><p>G) Improve inter-agency cooperation and coordination, </p><p>including with foreign law enforcement agencies; </p><p>H) Improve the conditions of service and welfare of all </p><p>officers, inspectors and rank-and file </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) Balogun particularly emphasized the need for better </p><p>training of NPF recruits and officers and the need to adopt a </p><p>community policing approach, citing the US experience which </p><p>should serve as a model for the NPF.  RNLEO pointed out that </p><p>the Police Reform project has these two issues as major </p><p>concentrations of technical assistance and training and gave </p><p>the IG a copy of the project document for his review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) Comment:  The new IGP seems to place great importance </p><p>in the U.S.-Nigerian law enforcement relationship.  Balogun </p><p>will likely be a strong partner in both our operational law </p><p>enforcement dealings and our police reform project.  Reports </p><p>from our sources seemed confirmed by this initial meeting: he </p><p>appears sharp, articulate, engaging and warm -- qualities not </p><p>found in his predecessor.  His strategic priorities are </p><p>another good sign, though we have some concerns about the </p><p>first point but tend to think at this time that the "fire for </p><p>fire" remark was intended more to bolster morale of police </p><p>operating in areas of intense violent crime than to convey </p><p>specific new policies or procedures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
