Powell </p><p>said that the U.S. request for troops was conveyed to </p><p>Ankara by CENTCOM Chairman General Abizaid last week. </p><p>Gul said it would be easier for Turkey to deploy troops </p><p>to Iraq under a NATO umbrella.  Secretary Powell also </p><p>asked for Ankara\'s support for the UN-sponsored Cyprus </p><p>peace plan, and added that an $8.5 billion loan for </p><p>Turkey would be released following the completion of </p><p>the IMF\'s fifth review.  Dailies report U.S. </p><p>Administration officials as saying that Turkish troops </p><p>could be deployed in any part of Iraq except in the </p><p>north.  Commentaries believe Ankara has demanded a </p><p>considerable share in Iraq\'s rebuilding in exchange for </p><p>a Turkish military contribution to Iraqi security.  Gul </p><p>has also demanded a role in the central administration </p><p>in Baghdad, mainly to prevent a prospective Kurdish </p><p>state in Northern Iraq.  Powell has given Gul the </p><p>message that the U.S. will not bargain over the issue, </p><p>and will not meet the cost of any troop deployment. </p><p>Dailies report that U.S. officials are uncomfortable </p><p>about Turkish efforts to create the impression that the </p><p>Americans first raised the issue of a Turkish troop </p><p>deployment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey, U.S. cooperation against PKK: Foreign Minister </p><p>Gul told the parliamentary foreign affairs committee </p><p>that the U.S. has been positive about cooperation with </p><p>Turkey against the PKK/KADEK presence in Northern Iraq. </p><p>The two allies will launch a joint military operation </p><p>against terrorists who don\'t lay down their arms in </p><p>light of the forthcoming repentance law now before the </p><p>Turkish parliament.  The decision to carry out a joint </p><p>operation against the terrorist presence in the region </p><p>was taken during CENTCOM Chairman General Abizaid\'s </p><p>visit to Ankara last week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: In a letter to the UN Secretary General Annan, </p><p>Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas offered to help clear </p><p>landmines deployed near Nicosia.  Denktas said such a </p><p>move would enhance mutual trust.  Greek Cypriot leader </p><p>Papadopoulos welcomed the offer, dailies report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Banking watchdog warns Uzans: Turkey\'s banking </p><p>watchdog, the Banking Regulatory Board (BDDK), has </p><p>accused the Uzan family of mafia activities and tax </p><p>evasion.  The BDDK said that the Uzan group must pay </p><p>its debts to account holders of Imarbank before being </p><p>considered eligible to buy PETKIM, Turkey\'s state-owned </p><p>petrochemical industry.  Imarbank, owned by the Uzans, </p><p>was recently taken over by the BDDK because of illicit </p><p>money transfers to the Uzan family\'s other companies. </p><p>In the meantime, the Uzan group was the top bidder </p><p>($605 million) in the PETKIM privatization tender. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq/Foreign troops commitments </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Why is it so difficult?" </p><p>Ferai Tinc observed in mass appeal Hurriyet (7/25): </p><p>"The Turkish government still continues its vague </p><p>stance that it has adopted since the early stages of </p><p>the Iraq operation.  The request for foreign troops to </p><p>Iraq became public knowledge over a month ago, yet the </p><p>government is still confused and indecisive instead of </p><p>formulating a concrete policy on this very important </p><p>issue. . Sending our troops to Iraq requires a serious </p><p>decision.  That decision must be made.  Turkey should </p><p>either insist on taking action only within an </p><p>international framework, which I believe is the right </p><p>thing to do, or agree to send its troops to Iraq as a </p><p>police force for the occupation.  Both options require </p><p>a decision, but we do not see the government making a </p><p>case for any of the options.  Instead, it is busy </p><p>trying to bargain." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Partnership for shame" </p><p>Mehmet Ocaktan argued in the Islamist-intellectual Yeni </p><p>Safak (7/25): "What is the justification for Turkish </p><p>soldiers going to serve in Iraq, where the people of </p><p>Iraq are struggling for their salvation.  It would be </p><p>the most shameful act by Turkey if a Turkish military </p><p>presence is designed to help the murderous gang which </p><p>takes instructions from the two liars, Bush and Blair. </p><p>. Nobody should dare to throw Turkey into a new </p><p>adventure on the pretext of improving Turkish-American </p><p>relations.  If Turkey takes any step to please the </p><p>occupying force in Iraq, it will not only harm its </p><p>image in the international community, but will also </p><p>lose its credibility under international law. . The </p><p>occupation forces of the US and the UK should leave </p><p>Iraq and let the UN decide on what to do next.  Turkey </p><p>should then take its place within the peacekeeping </p><p>force under the UN." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
