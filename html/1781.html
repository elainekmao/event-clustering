(C) THE SWEDES, AS EU PRESIDENT, HAVE LED THE EU TROIKA\'S </p><p>DISCUSSIONS IN HARARE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE UNDER ARTICLE </p><p>8 OF THE COTONOU AGREEMENT, WHICH BEGAN EARLY THIS YEAR.  THE </p><p>TROIKA\'S EFFORTS TO ENGAGE THE GOZ IN SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT </p><p>ITS RANGE OF CONCERNS, HOWEVER, HAVE GOTTEN NOWHERE WITH MFA </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY WILLARD CHIWEWE, THE SENIOR GOZ INTERLOCUTOR IN </p><p>THIS EXERCISE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF WAS INFORMED BY HIS SWEDISH </p><p>COUNTERPART -- IRINA SCHOULGIN -- ON JUNE 26 THAT THE EU\'S GENERAL </p><p>AFFAIRS COUNCIL (COMPRISING FOREIGN MINISTERS) IS FED UP WITH THE </p><p>GOZ\'S REFUSAL TO ENGAGE SERIOUSLY WITH THE EU.  THE COUNCIL DECIDED </p><p>IN BRUSSELS ON JUNE 25 TO DELIVER A TOUGH WARNING TO THE GOZ AND </p><p>INSTRUCTED THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR IN HARARE TO DELIVER A LETTER TO </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT CONVEYING THE FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>--NOTING LACK OF SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN ITS DIALOGUE WITH ZIMBABWE; </p><p>--EXPRESSING DEEP CONCERN OVER DEVELOPMENTS HERE, CALLING FOR: </p><p>A) AN END TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE; </p><p>B) AN INVITATION TO THE EU TO MONITOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION; </p><p>C) CONCRETE ACTIONS TO PROTECT FREEDOM OF THE MASS MEDIA; </p><p>D) INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND RESPECT FOR ITS DECISIONS; </p><p>E) AN END TO ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF PROPERTY; </p><p>--PROMISING TO FOLLOW CLOSELY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ABOVE AREAS DURING </p><p>THE NEXT TWO MONTHS AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE MEASURES IF SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>PROGRESS IS NOT ACHIEVED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE LAST POINT, SCHOULGIN NOTED, IS A CLEAR THREAT TO MOVE </p><p>TO ARTICLE 96, WHICH COULD REQUIRE THE SUSPENSION OF ALL EU AID TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01999  261520Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIAL.  THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR HOPES TO </p><p>DELIVER THE LETTER TO FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE ON JUNE 27 AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY PLANS TO RELEASE IT PUBLICLY. </p><p> </p><p>4.

HE MET </p><p>WITH FM MUDENGE ON JUNE 25 AND WILL MEET WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE ON </p><p>JUNE 26.  AMBASSADOR HOOKS PLANS TO DINE WITH AJELLO THE EVENING OF </p><p>JUNE 26 AND WILL SOLICIT A READOUT OF HIS HARARE DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT SEEN A COPY OF THE EU\'S LETTER, THE </p><p>DRAFT LANGUAGE DESCRIBED BY OUR SWEDISH COLLEAGUE IS VERY STRONG </p><p>INDEED. ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF EU DIPLOMATS HERE, THE TWO-MONTH </p><p>DEADLINE IS FIRM; WITHOUT ACHIEVEMENT OF "SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS" </p><p>DURING THAT PERIOD, THE EU APPEARS DETERMINED TO MOVE TO ARTICLE </p><p>96.  IT IS REFRESHING TO SEE THE EU TAKING SUCH A HARD LINE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH WE ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE LETTER WILL ELICIT SIGNIFICANT </p><p>PROGRESS, IT WILL PUT THE GOZ ON NOTICE THAT IT FACES SERIOUS </p><p>CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT TAKING CONCRETE STEPS TO ADDRESS EU CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
