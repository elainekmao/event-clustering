DART Field Team South met on 6 May with two extended </p><p>families and their neighbors in a poor section of Basrah to </p><p>assess their water and food needs.  Most inhabitants of the </p><p>area are Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), some of who </p><p>have been squatting on other people\'s land since the Iran- </p><p>Iraq war in 1980.  The families said that since the recent </p><p>hostilities began six weeks ago, their greatest concerns are </p><p>a lack of security, scarcity of cooking fuel, dwindling </p><p>incomes, and the threat of being forcibly evicted from homes </p><p>they have been living in for many years.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART, assisted by two women who work as monitors for </p><p>the U.N. World Food Program, met for two hours with two </p><p>families, of ten members each, in the Abo Al Khsib </p><p>neighborhood in south-central Basrah.  The group discussed </p><p>their concerns about food, security, and other issues.  Both </p><p>families, as well as some of their neighbors, were displaced </p><p>from the Faw peninsula.  One family was forced to leave in </p><p>the Iran-Iraq war in 1980.  The other family fled their home </p><p>in the first Gulf war in 1990. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Abo Al Khsib neighborhood is in a poor section of </p><p>town in south-central Basrah, where the two families and </p><p>their neighbors live in an adjoining series of one-story, </p><p>mud-brick rooms, built around small courtyards.  The rooms </p><p>have earthen floors, and those used as sleeping quarters are </p><p>covered by a carpet remnant and woven straw mats. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Most family members and their neighbors said security </p><p>was their primary concern.  One woman said the `bad </p><p>elements\' in the area, recognized by everyone in the </p><p>neighborhood before the war, have now enriched themselves by </p><p>looting guns and food commodities.  She said the criminals </p><p>often roam the area, settling disputes by shooting people. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Another woman complained about the lack of propane gas </p><p>for cooking fuel.  She said she has spent an average of </p><p>7,000 Iraqi dinars every three to four days to buy a </p><p>wagonload of palm wood to use as fuel.  Before the war, she </p><p>says four canisters of propane gas for an entire month cost </p><p>1,200 Iraqi Dinars.  Now, she has empty gas canisters but </p><p>cannot find fuel in the market. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The water situation in the neighborhood has improved </p><p>with non-potable water running in pipelines, which before </p><p>the war were empty.  However, obtaining drinking water is </p><p>still a challenge; a U.N. Children\'s Fund water tanker was </p><p>delivering drinking water during the visit by the DART, but </p><p>it was only the third such trip to the area since the start </p><p>of the war. </p><p> </p><p>7.  When asked whether their families had enough food, the </p><p>DART was told that the rations under the Oil for Food </p><p>Program were never enough to feed their families.  They said </p><p>all the commodities ran out before the end of the month, and </p><p>that the milk ration ran out quickly.  They felt that a </p><p>double package of rations would be sufficient to meet their </p><p>needs for one month.  They received double rations in </p><p>February to cover the months of April and May, and the last </p><p>distribution of a double ration, distributed in mid-March, </p><p>one week before the war began, was referred to as the </p><p>June/July distribution.  One family had only part of the </p><p>wheat flour and rice rations left. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The families say food prices in the Basrah market have </p><p>fluctuated almost daily since the war.  Some items, such as </p><p>vegetable oil and sugar, commodities largely looted from a </p><p>local warehouse and which now glut the market, are less </p><p>expensive.  They cited as examples the prices of several </p><p>staple items: pre-war one kilogram (kg) of tea cost 2,000 </p><p>dinars; the same amount now costs 3,000 dinars.  Before the </p><p>war, one kg of powdered milk cost 500 dinars; it is now </p><p>5,000 dinars.  One kg of rice was 250 dinars before the war; </p><p>it is now 350 dinars.  One kg of sugar, which was 600 dinars </p><p>before the war, is now 250 dinars.  One kg of vegetable oil </p><p>was 600 dinars before the war; it now costs between 300 and </p><p>500 dinars. </p><p> </p><p>9.  One of the extended families, with four sons and seven </p><p>daughters, relies on the income of one male head of </p><p>household.  Before the war, he had a job as a construction </p><p>worker, earning between 2,000 and 2,250 Iraqi dinars per day </p><p>but now earns only between 1,000 and 1,500 dinars per day </p><p>mowing grass for animal feed. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The other family has four sons and three daughters. </p><p>All of the sons are educated, one having a Master\'s degree, </p><p>but none can find a full-time job.  A daughter, who is a </p><p>teacher, had to stop working just before the war to give </p><p>birth to a child. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The two families had a small reserve of livestock: one </p><p>sheep, that was being fattened for slaughter, and four </p><p>goats. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Another concern expressed by the two families and their </p><p>neighbors was eviction from their homes.  They said </p><p>government officials came to the area last year, </p><p>confiscating all their furniture and demanding that they </p><p>vacate the premises.  Now, they fear, some other official or </p><p>landowner will come and demand the same.  They asked the </p><p>DART if it could help, and give them guidance on what </p><p>recourse they have if such an action were to take place. </p><p>13.  The DART has notified the International Organization </p><p>for Migration (IOM), which has been given the mandate to </p><p>care for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq, about </p><p>the existence of the IDPs in the neighborhood.  IOM says it </p><p>will follow up on the areas visited by the DART. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
