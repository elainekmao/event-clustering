<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 004392 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/TPA - DVERNON AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR CUSTOMS - R. STIRITI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EWWT, ETRD, AMGT, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  TURKEY AND THE CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Sirotic/Stiriti/Vernon Emails/telcons 7/10/03 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Customs Rome informed the Embassy (ref emails and </p><p>telcons) that the port of Izmir has been selected for </p><p>inclusion in the second phase of the Container Security </p><p>Initiative.  We further understand that Customs </p><p>Assistant Commissioner Shruhan and Customs Attache </p><p>Stiriti met with GOT counterparts andto discussed CSI in </p><p>February and July 2003, but we have not received any </p><p>front-channel instructions or guidance indicating that </p><p>the USG would be formally approaching the GOT on this </p><p>initiative.neither the Istanbul Consulate nor the </p><p>Embassy were able to send staff to these meetings.  We </p><p>also just learned that understand that Customs has </p><p>proposed to the GOT - prior to informing the Embassy of </p><p>the proposal (let alone initiating the NSDD-38 process) </p><p>- that a U.S. customs officer be stationed in Izmir, </p><p>first for a pilot period of several months, then </p><p>permanently, to implement the CSI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Mission fully supports CSI and is eager to work </p><p>with Washington agencies in securing Turkish cooperation </p><p>in the war on terror, but there are numerous local </p><p>issues to be considered.  We are disappointed that the </p><p>approach to the GOT on this was not coordinated or even </p><p>outlined in any official instruction.  Embassy requests </p><p>Department provide a front-channel message providing </p><p>guidance on this initiative, and also work with U.S. </p><p>Customs to ensure full interagency coordinationfurther </p><p>information on the planned inclusion of Turkey in CSI </p><p>and requests that future approaches to the GOT be </p><p>coordinated with relevant Mission elements.
