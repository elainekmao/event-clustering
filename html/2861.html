<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001079 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ECA/PE/V/G/A FOR BARBARA REED </p><p>INFO AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: FORMER IV GRANTEE BECOMES PUBLISHER </p><p> </p><p>1.   IV alumnus Mark Chavhunduka (Multi-regional </p><p>   project on print journalism, May 1992) has, at 36, </p><p>   become Zimbabwe\'s youngest publisher. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Chavhunduka, who until this month was editor of </p><p>   the independent weekly "The Standard," has assumed </p><p>   control of Thompson Publications.  Thompson publishes </p><p>   several magazines, including the country\'s largest </p><p>   circulating monthly magazine "Parade." </p><p> </p><p>3.   Chavhunduka\'s control of Thompson will strengthen </p><p>   the private media in Zimbabwe.  His commitment to </p><p>   freedom of the media is well known.  In spite of having </p><p>   been detained and tortured by the Zimbabwean military </p><p>   in January 1999 (after his newspaper published a report </p><p>   alleging an attempted coup within the military), </p><p>   Chavhunduka remained as editor of the Standard and </p><p>   continued to publish articles and opinion pieces </p><p>   critical of the Government of Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Chavhunduka has told us that the IV program, which </p><p>   brought him into regular contact with Embassy Harare </p><p>   and media organizations in the U.S., strengthened his </p><p>   abilities as a journalist and helped sustain him </p><p>   through the pressures he has faced. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
