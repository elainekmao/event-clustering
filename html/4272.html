<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008112 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND GUNARATNE, AND OFFICE OF </p><p>TRADE FINANCE </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF AND TURKISH CENTRAL BANK ON NEXT STEPS FOR THE </p><p>ECON PROGRAM:  FOCUS ON FISCAL TARGETS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  While the post-election market rally largely </p><p>continued on November 8, with T-bill rates dropping a further </p><p>2.5 percent, there was by the week\'s end greater press and </p><p>market attention to the likely policies of the new GOT.  IMF </p><p>resrep reviewed with us the outstanding structural and fiscal </p><p>conditions on the Fourth Review; he hopes to have AK </p><p>agreement to a November visit by IMF\'s Deppler, followed by a </p><p>full Mission visit in December.  The AK figures have yet to </p><p>meet with the economic bureaucrats, but Central Bank staff </p><p>told us they plan to stress to AK leaders:  "stick with the </p><p>6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus target."  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The strong market rallies largely continued on </p><p>November 8, on the back of local buying (Central Bank sources </p><p>say they didn\'t see large foreign inflows this week). </p><p>Lira-denominated T-bills dropped another 2.5 percentage </p><p>points to close at 53 percent compounded.  The lira </p><p>appreciated one percent to close at TL 1,619,000.  Profit </p><p>taking in the Istanbul stock exchange led to a 1.8 percent </p><p>decline, after a record week for trading volume.  Volume in </p><p>the stock market today was $1.55 billion (versus prior daily </p><p>averages of about $200 million.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Resrep on Next Steps </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) IMF resrep Brekk, meeting with visiting EUR/SE </p><p>director, said he spoke with AK\'s Ali Babacan today.  Brekk </p><p>believes AK will agree to a courtesy visit by IMF\'s Europe 1 </p><p>director Michael Deppler in late November, to be followed by </p><p>a full fledged IMF Mission visit in December, once the new </p><p>government is fully in place.  Brekk noted that AK leadership </p><p>had focused first on EU accession, and had been briefed by </p><p>bureaucrats on EU issues, but had not yet engaged the </p><p>bureaucracy on the economic reform program issues.  When they </p><p>did meet with Treasury and Central Bank, AK would learn of </p><p>the outstanding conditions on the Fourth Review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Among the key outstanding structural reform </p><p>conditions are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Banking Board\'s resolution of Yapi Kredi Bank\'s share </p><p>ownership (still being negotiated with controlling </p><p>shareholder Mehmet Karamehmet.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Submission to parliament of the direct tax reform bill. </p><p>(IMF has not seen a draft law, though there was agreement in </p><p>principle with MinFin Oral on contents of such a law. </p><p>Finance Ministry DG told us he will wait to show draft to new </p><p>AK MinFin before giving to IMF.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Reducing redundant jobs in state companies.  (GOT is </p><p>about 10,000 short of the 31,000 jobs identified as redundant </p><p>in a GOT study of state companies.  This will require </p><p>lay-offs, which remains sensitive.) </p><p>--  Adoption of Tekel privatization plan. (The planned </p><p>restructuring of state alcohol and tobacco giant TEKEL goes </p><p>beyond the mandate of the Privatization Administration, since </p><p>it requires lay-offs and ending tobacco price supports.  Thus </p><p>the plan must be submitted to the new GOT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The most important concern under the IMF program </p><p>remains the primary budget surplus, see septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Central Bank Staff Optimistic About 2003, </p><p>If AK Government Keeps Budget Tight </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Central Bank Markets DG Akil Ozcay told us November </p><p>8 that he is optimistic about 2003, provided the new GOT </p><p>keeps a tight fiscal policy.  "We\'ll tell the new government </p><p>that the 6.5 percent primary surplus target is not the IMF </p><p>target, it\'s the Treasury\'s and Central Bank\'s target.  It\'s </p><p>the anchor of our reform program, th the key to bringing down </p><p>real interest rates and reducing the government\'s borrowing </p><p>costs in 2003." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) On inflation trends, Ozcay said the latest </p><p>expectations survey showed a year-end 2002 expectation of 31 </p><p>percent CPI growth - well under the year-end 35 percent </p><p>target.  However, the year-end 2003 expectation was currently </p><p>24 percent - above the program target of 20 percent.  Ozcay </p><p>is confident that this expectation could be lowered by </p><p>maintaining tight monetary and fiscal policies.  He recalled </p><p>that no one expected at the beginning of 2002 that the CPI </p><p>target of 35 percent would be met.  Ozcay noted the market </p><p>pressures for the Central Bank to lower its overnight rates, </p><p>now that inflation was under program targets.  He said the </p><p>Central Bank was hesitant to join the "exuberance bandwagon" </p><p>and thus might wait a bit before cutting rates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Other economic indicators were also good, per </p><p>Ozcay.  On the balance of payments, current account numbers </p><p>were stronger than projected - the Central Bank now sees a </p><p>year-end current account deficit of about $500 million </p><p>(versus the projected $1.5 billion).  He attributed this </p><p>performance both to over-performing export growth, despite </p><p>the real lira appreciation and to the record year for tourism </p><p>- expected revenue of just under $10 billion.  He expects net </p><p>capital inflows in 2003, pointing to this week\'s successful </p><p>Eurobond offering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
