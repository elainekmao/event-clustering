<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002472 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: OUTGOING TREASURY U/S SAYS IT\'S ALL ABOUT </p><p>CONFIDENCE </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by EconCouns Scot Marciel.  Reason: 1.5(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Outgoing Treasury U/S Faik Oztrak believes </p><p>Turkey has an opportunity to reduce its debt/GNP ratio and </p><p>reach its five percent growth target this year if the </p><p>government can restore market confidence, but he is not sure </p><p>the government can and will stop giving the mixed signals </p><p>that have so far undermined that confidence.  Oztrak </p><p>acknowledged that interest rates need to drop significantly, </p><p>as current levels are unsustainable, but argued that a deep </p><p>recession resulting in social turmoil is a greater risk than </p><p>a debt default, at least this year.  Oztrak said Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul is the only minister who "gets it" when it comes </p><p>to the economy.  Ali Babacan understands economics to some </p><p>extent, but has no clout; the others have no understanding at </p><p>all.  Oztrak also reported that IMF Managing Director Kohler </p><p>delivered a tough message to Babacan April 14, essentially </p><p>telling him that the IMF would not disburse loans to Turkey </p><p>if it failed to fully implement sound policies.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During an April 15 farewell lunch, outgoing Treasury </p><p>U/S Faik Oztrak (protect) offered his thoughts on the </p><p>government and the outlook for the economy.  (Oztrak said he </p><p>would leave office by April 21 at the latest.)  He expressed </p><p>frustration that the current government, inclined toward </p><p>populism, had squandered its credibility with the markets and </p><p>thus missed a great opportunity to reduce real interest rates </p><p>and Turkey\'s debt/GNP ratio.  Similarly, it had lost </p><p>credibility with the IMF, including through recent moves such </p><p>as proposing spending any extra revenues gained through the </p><p>tax amnesty program to compensate farmers for debt payments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Oztrak reported that the IMF\'s unhappiness with the </p><p>GOT had manifested itself in Managing Director Kohler\'s tough </p><p>message to State Minister Babacan in Washington on April 14. </p><p>According to the read-out Oztrak received, Babacan began the </p><p>meeting by saying that AK\'s effective implementation of the </p><p>reform program should have inspired confidence.  Kohler cut </p><p>him off, saying he had a busy schedule and did not have time </p><p>for political statements.  Kohler then upbraided Babacan for </p><p>the government\'s failings to date and warned that, should the </p><p>government fail again, the Fund would not disburse the next </p><p>tranche. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Despite the government\'s failings to date, Oztrak </p><p>believes the Turkish economy can end the year in better shape </p><p>than it started.  The government has completed all its prior </p><p>actions for the Fourth Review, including passage of a strict </p><p>budget, and the economy is much more resilient than it was </p><p>two years ago.  The key, he stressed, is confidence.  If the </p><p>government can restore market confidence by fully </p><p>implementing the reform program, interest rates should fall </p><p>significantly.  In that case, consumer spending and private </p><p>investment -- now held back by a lack of confidence -- also </p><p>should rise, enabling Turkey to reach its five percent growth </p><p>target despite (or perhaps because of) implementation of </p><p>tight fiscal policy.  (Oztrak said he had argued to the </p><p>government that, if it fully implements the program, the </p><p>resulting fall in interest rates should make it possible for </p><p>it to spend, late this year, the 1.2 percent of GNP now </p><p>affected by an emergency partial government spending freeze. </p><p>This should be a huge incentive, he said, as it would </p><p>stimulate the economy ahead of next Spring\'s local elections.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) If, on the other hand, the government\'s actions fail </p><p>to bring interest rates down significantly, Turkey will face </p><p>serious problems.  Oztrak argued that, while the risk of a </p><p>debt default and financial crisis is always there, the </p><p>greater threat -- at least in 2003 -- is that continued weak </p><p>consumer/business confidence will keep domestic demand low </p><p>and usher in a potentially deep recession that could result </p><p>in social turmoil.  (Note:  Many analysts, noting that </p><p>inventory accumulation accounted for a large share of 2002\'s </p><p>7.8 percent GNP growth, argue that domestic demand remains </p><p>weak.  Several say that this fact, combined with the expected </p><p>decline in tourism due to the Iraq war, suggests that growth </p><p>is is likely to be less -- perhaps substantially less -- than </p><p>five percent this year.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Oztrak said he was not sure this government could and </p><p>would take the steps needed to restore confidence.  "They can </p><p>do the right thing when there is enough market pressure, but </p><p>you cannot take your eyes off them even for 24 hours."  He </p><p>said Foreign Minister Gul was the only minister who "gets it" </p><p>when it comes to economics.  Babacan "may understand," but </p><p>nobody listens to him because, in the AK hierarchy, he is </p><p>viewed as too young and junior.  Also, he has lost all </p><p>credibility, not only with the markets, but with the IMF and </p><p>the USG.  The remaining ministers do not understand economics </p><p>at all.  Some, he laughed, have criticized him and Central </p><p>Bank Governor Serdengecti for failing to lower interest rates </p><p>(as if they had the power to do so).  Oztrak admitted that </p><p>the ministers do not trust him, since he is not "one of </p><p>them."  In that sense, Turkey may benefit from a new Treasury </p><p>U/S if that person has the trust of AK leaders and a good </p><p>understanding of what needs to be done.  On the other hand, </p><p>if the government replaces some or all of the Treasury Deputy </p><p>U/S\'s with "its people," prospects for full implementation of </p><p>the reform program will decline. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
