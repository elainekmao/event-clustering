<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 007328 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, EB/CBA, AND OES/ENV </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>COMMERCE ALSO FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>STATE PASS EPA FOR LEE PASAREW </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR TOM OLIVER </p><p>STATE PASS EXIM FOR JOE GRANDMAISON </p><p>CUSTOMS FOR CRAIG WALKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, SENV, BEXP, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: CAPITALIZING ON THE JOINT COMMITTEE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Jordan\'s government and business community are </p><p>hailing the first annual U.S.-Jordan Joint Economic Committee </p><p>meeting held in Washington December 11, and the </p><p>private-sector trade events that surrounded it, as </p><p>unqualified successes.  Jordanian participants were impressed </p><p>by and appreciative of the high-level USG interest the </p><p>meetings received, notably participation by Commerce </p><p>Secretary Evans, USTR Zoellick, AUSTR Novelli, A/S Wayne, and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>A/S Burns.  U.S. participants in some of the private sector </p><p>meetings similarly were impressed by the energy and </p><p>professionalism of members of the Jordanian private sector </p><p>delegation.  Jordanian government and private sector leaders </p><p>were especially grateful to Amy Schedlbauer, Carl Oberg, Ned </p><p>Saums, and Roger Freeman for their key contributions to the </p><p>success of the JC events. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  The meetings have generated a number of follow-up </p><p>opportunities, both officially and with private sector </p><p>groups.  USTR is preparing an official schedule of </p><p>commitments agreed to by each side at the December 11 </p><p>meeting.  In addition to these official commitments, the JC </p><p>events surrounding the official meeting created numerous </p><p>follow-up projects for the private sector.  They include: </p><p> </p><p>--  TIJARA counterpart:  We continue to encourage the </p><p>formation of a TIJARA counterpart in the U.S. to include </p><p>representatives of interested U.S. business associations, </p><p>U.S. government agencies, and the Jordanian Embassy. </p><p>Ideally, a U.S. association such as the National U.S.-Arab </p><p>Chambers of Commerce (NUSACC) would work with a lead USG </p><p>agency such as DoC to invite interested associations, with </p><p>invitations based initially on attendees of the DoC-sponsored </p><p>event December 12.  The focus of such a group would be </p><p>primarily to raise awareness among the memberships of the </p><p>associations about opportunities offered under the FTA, and </p><p>to encourage continued cooperation between U.S. associations </p><p>and their Jordanian counterparts.  Ultimately, meetings </p><p>between the two groups could become a fixture of future JC </p><p>meetings. </p><p> </p><p>--  AJEX support:  DoC DAS Molly Williamson agreed to lead a </p><p>group of U.S. business associations to Amman to participate </p><p>in the AJEX program (the American products show) March 26-28. </p><p> Invitees will include at minimum participants in the </p><p>December 12 DoC-hosted event.  The purpose of the mission, in </p><p>addition to supporting JABA\'s AJEX program, will be to create </p><p>a core of U.S. businessmen in key associations who can advise </p><p>members of their associations about business realities in </p><p>Jordan (including standard of living, investment climate, and </p><p>security issues) that are often at odds with - and much </p><p>better than - perceptions from media reports.  Having a group </p><p>of such businessmen who have experienced Jordan first-hand, </p><p>it is thought, will help tear down one key barrier to new </p><p>trade and investment under the FTA, i.e., misperceptions </p><p>about Jordan\'s business and security environment. </p><p> </p><p>--  Trade finance:  Financing is one of the main obstacles </p><p>cited by Jordanians and Americans to expanding bilateral </p><p>trade and investment.  A seminar on trade and investment </p><p>financing under the FTA would have a wide and enthusiastic </p><p>audience in Amman.  It would raise awareness about the </p><p>services offered by EXIM, OPIC and TDA, as well as by private </p><p>banks.  As Econoff discussed with EXIM\'s Robert Bosco on the </p><p>margins of the DoC event, the best time frame for such an </p><p>event would be during the AJEX show, March 26-28.  JABA and </p><p>local banks would be willing to help support such an event. </p><p>We would welcome further discussions with Washington to </p><p>pursue this idea. </p><p> </p><p>--  Pharmaceuticals Follow-up:  The Jordanian Pharmaceutical </p><p>Association (JAPM), in cooperation with the U.S. generic </p><p>pharmaceutical manufacturers\' association (GPhA), the </p><p>Embassy, and DoC, will encourage a group of small and </p><p>medium-sized U.S. generic pharmaceuticals manufacturers to </p><p>visit Jordan on a fact-finding tour in the coming months. </p><p>Currently, we are looking at late May-early June, to coincide </p><p>with a World Trade Week program sponsored by World Trade </p><p>Center Amman and the Jordan Exporters\' Association.  The goal </p><p>of the fact-finding tour is to give the companies an overview </p><p>of manufacturing facilities in Jordan and to encourage </p><p>partnerships between U.S. and Jordanian manufacturers.  This </p><p>activity will build on the ongoing cooperation between JAPM, </p><p>PhRMA, and the GOJ. </p><p> </p><p>--  QIZ Follow-up:  Following on the success of the QIZ </p><p>roundtable held at DoS on December 13, the Embassy has been </p><p>in contact with representatives of USAITA, the U.S. trade </p><p>association representing garment retailers, to explore </p><p>possible follow-up activities.  These include forming a </p><p>Jordanian delegation to hold a similar program in New York or </p><p>Los Angeles in the spring; inviting USAITA to hold Board </p><p>meetings or regional meetings in Amman; inviting USAITA to </p><p>form a delegation of retailers to visit Jordan for a </p><p>fact-finding tour; and offers from the Embassy and qualified </p><p>Jordanians to speak to USAITA members via digital video </p><p>conference.  We will continue this dialogue over the coming </p><p>months. </p><p> </p><p>--  Environmental Forum Proposals:  When the Jordanian </p><p>private sector delegation met the USG official delegation to </p><p>the JC on December 11, Imad Badran of the Zarqa Chamber of </p><p>Industry requested USG assistance in developing a plan to </p><p>build a waste treatment facility in Zarqa to serve a variety </p><p>of local industries (Zarqa is the home to most of Jordan\'s </p><p>heavy industry, including the oil refinery and steel mill). </p><p>State/OES expressed interest in following up the project </p><p>under the umbrella of the Joint Environmental Forum, in </p><p>keeping with Jordanian delegate Alia Boran\'s expressed desire </p><p>to find specific programs for the forum to engage on in the </p><p>short term. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Keeping up the momentum generated by the JC events </p><p>will be a priority for the Embassy in the coming months. </p><p>Successful pursuit of the activities outlined above will go a </p><p>long way toward raising awareness of the FTA\'s potential </p><p>among key U.S. and Jordanian business sectors. We look </p><p>forward to working with interested Washington agencies to </p><p>make these programs as successful as the JC events that </p><p>spawned them. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
