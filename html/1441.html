<p>UNCLAS KINSHASA 008501 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: MORJANE ADDRESSES DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: KINSHASA 8455 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. AMBASSADOR MORJANE ADDRESSED THE ENTIRE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>COMMUNITY DECEMBER 21 TO SUMMARIZE THE POLITICAL/MILITARY </p><p>SITUATION IN THE DRC AT YEAR\'S END, AND TO COMMUNICATE THE </p><p>DIRECTION OF MONUC IN LIGHT OF UNSC RESOLUTION 1332. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. OVERALL, MORJANE VIEWED THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY IN THE </p><p>DRC AS "POSITIVE" COMPARED WITH THE END OF LAST YEAR, AND </p><p>SAID HE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE RECENT SERIES OF REGIONAL </p><p>DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT THE PEACE PROCESS -- MAPUTO </p><p>I AND II; THE KINSHASA FRANCOPHONE CHIEFS OF STATE MEETING; </p><p>TRIPOLI; THE LUSAKA JPC MEETING; AND THE RECENT SIGNATURE OF </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT "SUB-PLANS" AT HARARE.  HOWEVER, MORJANE </p><p>EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE THESE INITIATIVES "COORDINATED </p><p>TOWARD THE SAME GOAL."  MORJANE VIEWED THE CURRENT MEETINGS </p><p>IN LIBREVILLE POSITIVELY AS WELL, BUT URGED THAT PARTICIPANTS </p><p>IN THIS AND OTHER INITIATIVES MAINTAIN A COMMON POINT OF </p><p>REFERENCE: THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  HE ALSO OBSERVED THAT ONLY </p><p>THREE OF THE HARARE SIGNATORIES HAD ACTUALLY ISSUED </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT ORDERS TO THEIR FORCES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. WITH REGARD TO UNSC RESOLUTION 1332, MORJANE WAS PLEASED </p><p>TO SEE THAT INITIATIVES HE HAD REQUESTED, AND HAD EXPRESSED </p><p>DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY GENERAL, HAD BEEN INCORPORATED INTO </p><p>THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION.  THE UNSC, HE SAID, HAD DECIDED </p><p>"TO GIVE THE PARTIES ANOTHER CHANCE -- TO PROVE THEIR GOOD </p><p>FAITH."  HE SPECIFICALLY CITED UNSCR 1332\'S PROVISION FOR A </p><p>POSSIBLE MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL WITH SIGNATORIES IN </p><p>FEBRUARY TO REVIEW PROGRESS IN DISENGAGEMENT, DISARMAMENT, </p><p>AND WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN FORCES. HE POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>PARAGRAPH 18 EXPRESSED CLEARLY THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>CONSEQUENCES FOR INACTION IN THE FACE OF MOUNTING </p><p>"INTERNATIONAL FRUSTRATION." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. MORJANE MADE A SPECIAL POINT TO EXPRESS HIS GRAVE CONCERN </p><p>THAT ZAMBIA MIGHT BE PULLED INTO THE DRC CONFLICT DUE TO THE </p><p>CURRENT FIGHTING ALONG ITS BORDER.  THE AMBASSADOR OPINED </p><p>THAT THE CRISIS HAD REACHED A PARTICULARLY DELICATE MOMENT, </p><p>AND SAID THAT "ALL ACTIONS MUST BE BALANCED TOWARD A </p><p>SOLUTION."  FOR HIS PART, THE SRSG SAID THAT HE PLANNED TO </p><p>PUT A PERMANENT TEAM IN ZAMBIA NEAR THE BORDER IN VIEW OF THE </p><p>SERIOUSNESS OF THE PROBLEM THERE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. MORJANE FINISHED HIS ADDRESS BY LAUNCHING AN APPEAL FOR </p><p>TROOPS TO REPLACE THE TWO BATTALIONS FROM PAKISTAN ORIGINALLY </p><p>FORSEEN FOR THE DRC BUT SINCE SENT TO SIERRA LEONE. THERE ARE </p><p>NOW, HE SAID, ONLY TWO BATALLIONS SLATED TO COME TO THE DRC, </p><p>ONE FROM SENEGAL AND ONE FROM MOROCCO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. AMBASSADOR MORJANE MADE A SPECIAL APPEAL FOR RIVERINE </p><p>UNITS -- BOATS AND CREWS -- TO REPLACE THE ITALIAN UNITS </p><p>(PROMISED BUT LATER WITHDRAWN) TO HELP REOPEN THE CONGO RIVER </p><p>TO COMMERCE BETWEEN MBANDAKA AND KISANGANI -- TWO SITES </p><p>SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED IN UNSCR 1332 (OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH </p><p>EIGHT).  MORJANE SAID THAT HE VIEWS AS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL </p><p>THE "RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTACT AMONG THE PROVINCES." </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
