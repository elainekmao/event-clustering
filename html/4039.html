Summary: OFDA/Humanitarian Response Advisor in </p><p>Zimbabwe has received unconfirmed but credible reports </p><p>of forced relocations of a large group of ex-commercial </p><p>farm workers. Post views this as an extremely serious </p><p>development and is concerned that it may signal the </p><p>beginning of a pattern of forced relocation and </p><p>displacement that could affect a significant number of </p><p>the estimated 1-1.5 million displaced farm workers and </p><p>their families, many of whom the GOZ considers </p><p>officially not to be Zimbabwean citizens.  While many </p><p>commercial farm workers originate from other countries </p><p>in the region, large numbers of them have been resident </p><p>in Zimbabwe for several generations, have no </p><p>documentation from their countries of origin and should </p><p>be considered de facto Zimbabweans.  Reported </p><p>relocations are apparently to remote sites close to </p><p>borders from which relocatees may be encouraged to </p><p>return to their countries of origin.  International </p><p>Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is also hearing </p><p>stories of forced relocations and trying to gain access </p><p>to the area.  OFDA advisor will continue to try to </p><p>verify these reports directly including, if possible, </p><p>travel to reported relocation sites to interview </p><p>affected populations.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. OFDA/Humanitarian Response Advisor (HRA) traveled </p><p>with Ambassador Hall\'s group to northern Zimbabwe on </p><p>October 10 to observe a food distribution and do </p><p>reconnaissance of the area.  Ambassador Sullivan, USAID </p><p>Mission Director and Mission Disaster Officer </p><p>accompanied.  The event took place at the Chiweshi </p><p>public school in the Muzarabani District on the Zambezi </p><p>escarpment. </p><p> </p><p>3. In the course of the visit, OFDA/HRA met with a World </p><p>Food Program (WFP) food monitor at the distribution who </p><p>said that up to 5,000 farm workers and family members </p><p>were being assembled in the Gaierezi area in the Zambezi </p><p>valley.  The WFP food monitor said that some of the farm </p><p>workers were trucked to these locations.  Two political </p><p>jurisdictions, Chadereka and Dambakurima, were </p><p>mentioned.  These are ward names which are political sub- </p><p>jurisdictions of districts. </p><p> </p><p>4. The displacement and trucking operation was described </p><p>as follows: New settlers take over the farms vacated by </p><p>commercial farmers. Settlers insist on moving into the </p><p>farm workers\' houses and force them to vacate the </p><p>premises.  Wanting the ex-farm workers and house </p><p>occupants out of sight and out of mind, settlers force </p><p>former occupants to board lorries for movement to remote </p><p>sites in the Zambezi plain.  On arrival at relocation </p><p>sites, they are unloaded.  According to the WFP monitor, </p><p>it is the new farmers/settlers who were responsible for </p><p>trucking the ex-farm workers out of the region and there </p><p>is no clear evidence of direct Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>involvement.  On arrival at the Zambezi plain, the </p><p>displaced farm workers and their families must fend for </p><p>themselves with whatever few personal possessions they </p><p>were able to carry, no access to farmable land, no seeds </p><p>and tools with which to begin farming, and no access to </p><p>humanitarian assistance. </p><p> </p><p>5. OFDA/HRA, operating under concern that farm workers </p><p>with no jobs and no food would begin to move somewhere </p><p>(see septel), has for several weeks been trying to </p><p>locate groupings of them in parts of Zimbabwe. </p><p>Information developed on this trip with Ambassadors Hall </p><p>and Sullivan is the first report of trucks being used to </p><p>relocate ex- farm workers.  Note: if events as reported </p><p>by the WFP monitor are true and accurate, based on an </p><p>assumed lorry capacity of 50 people and a total number </p><p>of 5,000 people moved, that would mean 100 lorry trips </p><p>in total over a short period of time and signal a </p><p>systematically planned event as opposed to a spontaneous </p><p>action. </p><p> </p><p>6. In an effort to corroborate the report, OFDA/HRA put </p><p>forward an urgent alert October 11 to the UNDP/Relief </p><p>and Rehabilitation Unit (RRU), the WFP, ICRC, and local </p><p>Zimbabwean groups seeking answers to the following </p><p>questions: </p><p> </p><p>- Did this movement as reported indeed happen? </p><p>- If so, how many people were involved? </p><p>- Is there any indication that the GOZ was in any way </p><p>involved in this movement? </p><p>- What is known about the current condition of the </p><p>people who were reported to have been moved? </p><p>- If the report is true, is there any organization </p><p>prepared to provide food or other necessary assistance? </p><p>- Is this action being replicated anywhere else in the </p><p>country? </p><p>- Is there any significance to depositing these people </p><p>close to the Mozambican border? </p><p> </p><p>7. On October 16, OFDA/HRA met with representatives of </p><p>the non-governmental organizations Justice for </p><p>Agriculture (JAG) and General Agricultural and </p><p>Plantation Workers Union of Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ) to try to </p><p>confirm the October 10 information.  GAPWUZ officials </p><p>advised that people had been or were being moved to </p><p>these sites.  One GAPWUZ representative indicated that a </p><p>relative from the area had noted a substantial increase </p><p>in the number of farm workers in the area. She described </p><p>the relocation area as "inhospitable."  Over the course </p><p>of the week, JAG representatives asserted that the </p><p>reports of trucking were true and speculated that the </p><p>trucks used were from the GOZ District Development Fund </p><p>(DDF), but this allegation has not been confirmed. </p><p> </p><p>8. OFDA/HRA is also exploring the possibility that these </p><p>workers may have come from Guruve in the north west </p><p>corner of Mashonaland Central adjacent to the Mozambique </p><p>border.  Earlier unconfirmed reports from Justice for </p><p>Agriculture asserted that some 2,500 farm workers in the </p><p>Guruve area had been told that they must "get out or </p><p>die." Based on an average family size of 6, this would </p><p>mean that some 14,000 people in total could be involved. </p><p>JAG representatives saw farm workers sitting alongside </p><p>the road with their possessions September 25. </p><p> </p><p>9. Despite various efforts to locate them, the Guruve </p><p>farm workers were never found.  OFDA/HRA and other </p><p>humanitarian agencies now suspect that they could be </p><p>among those relocated to the Chadereka and Danakurima </p><p>areas.  OFDA/HRA will try to confirm whether these </p><p>people were trucked using official GoZ District </p><p>Development Fund (DDF) trucks.  DDF is responsible for </p><p>supplying "new farmers" with the necessary inputs for </p><p>the upcoming agricultural season and are essentially GOZ </p><p>assets. </p><p> </p><p>10.  OFDA/HRA\'s concern is that ex-farm workers with few </p><p>options are being moved to places near borders that are </p><p>out of sight and therefore out of mind from </p><p>international observers.  There is a high level of GoZ </p><p>political control of these areas, which have few entry </p><p>roads of significance.  ICRC is reporting suspicious </p><p>signs of political control in the sense that people on </p><p>the ground in the Muzarabani District were attempting to </p><p>limit their access to the area.  Efforts are being made </p><p>to determine if similar groups of people are showing up </p><p>near the eastern Mozambique border north of Nyamaroda. </p><p> </p><p>11. Conservative estimates are that the total number of </p><p>farm workers and family members is 1.0 to 1.5 million. </p><p>If true, that would constitute nearly one out of every 8 </p><p>people in Zimbabwe.  According to GAPWUZ, approximately </p><p>60% of ex-commercial farm workers are of foreign </p><p>extraction, i.e., from Malawi, Mozambique, or Zambia and </p><p>are without official legal documentation. However, as </p><p>reported earlier in septel, most of these workers have </p><p>been in Zimbabwe for several generations, have no </p><p>remaining official connection to or documentation from </p><p>their countries of origin, and should be considered de- </p><p>facto Zimbabweans. </p><p> </p><p>12. Comment: Post considers reports of forced relocation </p><p>of ex-commercial farm workers to be credible and will </p><p>make every effort over the next week to verify </p><p>information including an estimate of the magnitude of </p><p>the problem.  To this end, OFDA/HRA will attempt to </p><p>locate and conduct interviews directly with the affected </p><p>populations at relocation sites.  JAG representatives, </p><p>who have been briefed on how to negotiate their way into </p><p>and out of the area, are planning to go there October 19 </p><p>and are expected back October 20. OFDA/HRA is planning </p><p>to go to the area as well with Christian Care, the WFP </p><p>food distributor in the area. If reports are true, the </p><p>situation would constitute a very serious concern for </p><p>OFDA and other international organizations providing </p><p>humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis in </p><p>Zimbabwe. Furthermore, forced relocation of ex-farm </p><p>workers, many of whom the GOZ considers to be non- </p><p>citizens, would constitute an extremely serious and </p><p>negative development in the ongoing crisis in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>13. OFDA/HRA will provide by septel a description of </p><p>efforts to date to systematize information collection </p><p>about the IDPs, inherent difficulties in collecting that </p><p>information, role and position of the UNDP/Relief and </p><p>Recovery Unit on the issue, and recommendations on </p><p>necessary support from the international community to </p><p>assist in this effort.
