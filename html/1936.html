SUMMARY: DEPUTY PRINCIPAL OFFICER AND ACTING CONSUL </p><p>GENERAL SHARON WHITE MET AUGUST 27 WITH HCMC PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE VICE-CHAIRWOMAN HUYNH THI NHAN.  MS. NHAN IS </p><p>ONE OF THREE NEW VICE-CHAIRPERSONS APPOINTED TO THE </p><p>HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IN MAY.  (THERE ARE A TOTAL OF </p><p>FIVE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE VICE-CHAIRPERSONS.)  IN </p><p>HER FIRST OFFICIAL ENCOUNTER WITH THE CONSULATE </p><p>GENERAL, MS. NHAN APPEARED KNOWLEDGEABLE AND AT EASE </p><p>WITH THE VARIETY OF ISSUES HCMC (THE CITY) FACES IN ITS </p><p>CURRENT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>URBAN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. ACG WHITE NOTED THAT MANY PEOPLE VIEW HCMC AS A </p><p>MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE REST OF VIETNAM.  ACG ALSO </p><p>INQUIRED ABOUT THE SRV CENTRAL GOVERNMENT GRANTING HCMC </p><p>LATITUDE TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT MECHANISMS IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01042  01 OF 02  060053Z </p><p>ADDRESSING DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS.  MS. NHAN SAID THAT </p><p>HANOI AND HCMC ARE REFERRED TO AS CITIES WITH A SPECIAL </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE STATUS, BUT IN FACT, THEY OPERATE AS </p><p>PROVINCES.  THE SRV CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, IN FACT, HAS </p><p>RECENTLY GRANTED HCMC MORE DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY IN </p><p>MATTERS DEALING WITH ITS OWN ECONOMY.  THE HCMC </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A DRAFT </p><p>DECREE THAT WOULD GIVE THE CITY MORE INDEPENDENCE IN </p><p>PREPARING ITS OWN BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>3. MS. NHAN SAID THE CITY\'S GREATEST CHALLENGE IS TO </p><p>IMPROVE ITS INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF </p><p>ITS BURGEONING POPULATION.  AS A MANUFACTURING AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL CENTER, THE CITY DRAWS ECONOMIC MIGRANTS </p><p>FROM THE RURAL COUNTRYSIDE.  NEWCOMERS TO THE CITY </p><p>NOTICE TRAFFIC CONGESTION AS ONE OBVIOUS RESULT OF </p><p>OVERCROWDING.  THE LARGE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS, HOWEVER, </p><p>ALSO CREATES A DEMAND FOR EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, POWER, </p><p>WATER SUPPLY, EDUCATION, AND HEALTHCARE THAT THE CITY </p><p>IS STRUGGLING TO MEET. </p><p> </p><p>4. MS. NHAN POINTED OUT THAT HCMC\'S SUCCESSFUL CANAL </p><p>CLEAN-UP PROJECT ADDRESSED BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND </p><p>HOUSING PROBLEMS.  OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, HCMC HAS </p><p>DREDGED, CLEANED, AND BEAUTIFIED THE THI NGHE-NHIEU LOC </p><p>CANAL AND RELOCATED 6,000 HOUSEHOLDS FROM "SHABBY </p><p>HOUSES AND SLUMS" BUILT OUT OVER THE CANAL TO MORE </p><p>SUITABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT SITES.  OVER THE NEXT 5 TO </p><p>10 YEARS, THE CITY PLANS TO CLEAN UP ITS OTHER CANALS </p><p>AND RELOCATE 10,000 MORE HOUSEHOLDS FROM CANAL SLUMS TO </p><p>BETTER HOUSING. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01042  01 OF 02  060053Z </p><p> </p><p>5. ACG WHITE NOTED THE VISITS TO HCMC IN THE PREVIOUS </p><p>THREE WEEKS OF AMERICAN DELEGATIONS INTERESTED IN MASS </p><p>TRANSIT, AGRICULTURE, AND AIR QUALITY.  SHE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT THE CONSULATE GENERAL COULD HELP ARRANGE FOR </p><p>EXPERTS OR STUDY GROUPS ON ONE OR MORE TOPICS RELATED </p><p>TO URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT.  SHE ALSO NOTED THAT </p><p>THE USG WAS PREPARED TO HELP WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. MS. NHAN WELCOMED US DELEGATIONS THAT COULD BRING </p><p>TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ON ADDRESSING URBAN DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ISSUES.  SHE SAID THE CITY ALSO WELCOMED TRADE MISSIONS </p><p>AND BUSINESS DELEGATIONS.  ACG ADDED THAT THE </p><p>INCREASING NUMBER OF VISITING US DELEGATIONS, WHETHER </p><p>GOVERNMENT OR PRIVATE, WOULD CONSTITUTE A POOL OF US </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHO SUPPORT HCMC\'S, AND </p><p>VIETNAM\'S, EFFORTS TO DEVELOP. </p><p> </p><p>BIO-INFORMATION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. MS. HUYNH THI NHAN (VIETNAMESE NAME ORDER: LAST </p><p>NAME, MIDDLE NAME, FIRST NAME) WAS BORN IN 1951 IN </p><p>SAIGON.  SHE HAS A BACHELOR\'S DEGREE IN LAW AND A </p><p>MASTER\'S DEGREE IN ECONOMICS.  IN MAY 2001, SHE WAS </p><p>APPOINTED HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE VICE-CHAIRWOMAN IN </p><p>CHARGE OF BUDGET AND FINANCE.  PREVIOUSLY, SHE WAS </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE HCMC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND PRICING. </p><p>PRIOR TO THAT, SHE WAS CHAIRWOMAN OF THE HOC MON </p><p>DISTRICT (HCMC) PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>TANNENBAUM </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
