<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HANOI 001362 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT:  Cadre Rotation - Grooming the next generation of </p><p>leaders </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  Vietnam is attempting to breathe new life </p><p>into "cadre rotation" in order to train the next generation </p><p>of leaders as well as to improve the quality of government </p><p>service and to fight systemic local corruption.  Cadre </p><p>rotation was common during wartime and in the years </p><p>immediately after unification, but had declined in more </p><p>recent decades.  Following renewed attention by the </p><p>Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), new rotations take place </p><p>at two levels:  between national ministerial-level positions </p><p>and provincial leadership jobs, and between provincial </p><p>department-level positions and district leadership jobs. </p><p>The CPV\'s personnel apparatus controls the entire process. </p><p>Almost all rotated individuals are CPV members because "a </p><p>high sense of political awareness" is required for </p><p>leadership positions in Vietnam.  Provincial-level </p><p>implementation varies throughout the country and individual </p><p>participation is sometimes unenthusiastic.  Rotation is in </p><p>the final analysis a tool by central authorities to enhance </p><p>control and diminish the strength of local, potentially </p><p>competing sources of power. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Party Resolution Eleven </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  CPV Politburo Resolution Eleven of January 25, </p><p>2002, renewed emphasis on cadre rotation for party, </p><p>government, Vietnam Fatherland Front, and State-owned </p><p>enterprise officials.  Although the practice had never </p><p>completely died out, according to several CPV and GVN </p><p>officials it had become less and less systematic after the </p><p>mid- to late-1970\'s.  Party leaders have pointed out that, </p><p>after the next CPV Congress in 2006, all or almost all </p><p>senior officials will have had no pre-1975 experience.  CPV </p><p>personnel officials reportedly designed the new rotation </p><p>system to build the experience of capable younger officials </p><p>to ready them for more senior positions.  As such, the focus </p><p>of rotation is not on filling jobs, but on developing </p><p>leadership expertise and ensuring that the next generation </p><p>of leaders has a broad range of experience, including at </p><p>grassroots levels. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Reviving rotation has been a rather slow, </p><p>deliberate process.  When poloffs first asked central and </p><p>provincial authorities about implementing cadre rotation in </p><p>mid-2002, the answer was that they had done little and could </p><p>not say much about it yet, apart from a few test cases. </p><p>Officials were hazy about practical details, such as </p><p>available housing for incoming officials (especially </p><p>officials sent to Hanoi) and arrangements for family members </p><p>(do they stay behind?  do they come along?  what about jobs </p><p>for spouses and schooling for children?)  However, in March </p><p>and April 2003, the CPV Central Organization and Personnel </p><p>Commission, headed by fourteenth-ranked Politburo member, </p><p>Tran Dinh Hoan (also a member of the CPV Secretariat and </p><p>head of the main Party school, the Ho Chi Minh Political </p><p>Academy),A organized meetings -- one in Phu Tho province for </p><p>northern officials and one in Ho Chi Minh City for southern </p><p>officials -- for provincial-level officials to discuss </p><p>implementation of the program.  According to an article by </p><p>Hoan in the April 15 edition of the CPV mouthpiece, Nhan </p><p>Dan, since the beginning of 2002, only 28 cadres rotated </p><p>between national/province posts along with over 1,200 </p><p>between provincial/district posts.  In addition, over 200 </p><p>cadres rotated between different national-level positions. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Rotation of Provincial Cadres -- Phu Tho </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Poloffs recently met with Phu Tho provincial </p><p>officials to discuss cadre rotation.  Tran Dinh Hoan had </p><p>singled out several provinces for their work on cadre </p><p>rotation, naming Phu Tho first.  This province is about 40 </p><p>km northwest of Hanoi astride the Red River, comprising the </p><p>upper reaches of the Red River Delta and a large proportion </p><p>of hilly land.  The population is about 1,300,000, 90% </p><p>ethnic majority Kinh.  The poverty rate is about 12%. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  According to Bui Hung, head of the provincial CPV </p><p>Personnel Committee, an individual\'s "talent" more than any </p><p>other factor determines participation in the program.  The </p><p>CPV exercises the "leading role" over all personnel matters, </p><p>including governmental rotations, he admitted.  The program </p><p>is part of the overall provincial personnel development </p><p>plan, Hung added.  Its particular purpose is to improve the </p><p>quality of leaders and managers who have already received </p><p>considerable training; the rotation is also integrated with </p><p>other educational and training opportunities.  Further </p><p>selection criteria include political, "conduct," and health </p><p>considerations.  Hung noted that the province had to pay </p><p>special attention to providing "good conditions" for </p><p>officials rotated to remote areas.  These include free </p><p>housing and financial support.  Phu Tho had applied the new </p><p>rotation policy to management officials first, especially to </p><p>those familiar with economics, and moved them into positions </p><p>where they could apply their training and experience.  He </p><p>added that Phu Tho had already rotated about 100 officials </p><p>under the program.  Also, one Phu Tho official (whom he </p><p>declined to name) had already rotated to a national-level </p><p>CPV post. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Hung claimed that the system of selecting cadre for </p><p>the current program was different than in past cadre </p><p>rotation cycles (although he declined to specify how).  The </p><p>province\'s rotation plan is being carried out in several </p><p>phases and is based on available staff, he noted.  A primary </p><p>consideration is an evaluation of who is most suitable for a </p><p>new post.  Participating officials all have considerable </p><p>work experience and have risen to at least the level of vice </p><p>chairman of a district, or deputy director of a provincial- </p><p>level department.  Generally, they will remain responsible </p><p>for areas in which they already have expertise, serving </p><p>instead in a different location.  Officials can be rotated </p><p>not just from government post to government post, but also </p><p>to or from Party or mass organization positions.  Except for </p><p>some individuals responsible for specific economic matters, </p><p>for instance at state-owned enterprises, all rotated persons </p><p>are CPV members, he admitted.  Hung explained that, from the </p><p>district level up, political considerations are "very </p><p>important," hence the need for CPV membership as a </p><p>prerequisite. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Bac Ninh:  Focus on Junior Officials </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Bac Ninh is the smallest province in Vietnam, but </p><p>is densely populated with a population of almost one </p><p>million.  Located just north of Hanoi, it has a long history </p><p>of providing state officials.  According to one Bac Ninh </p><p>leader, two thirds of Vietnam\'s Confucian doctorate-level </p><p>scholars came from Bac Ninh in the imperial days.  He also </p><p>noted the province\'s long history as a center of Buddhism in </p><p>Vietnam.  However, it has only existed as a separate </p><p>province since 1997. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Bac Ninh officials admitted that there had as yet </p><p>been very little cadre rotation in the province in the wake </p><p>of Resolution Eleven.  Officials framed cadre rotation as </p><p>part of overall personnel training and development </p><p>activities.  Bac Ninh has been concentrating its personnel </p><p>development efforts on commune-level officials (who are </p><p>still too junior to be rotated under the current program) </p><p>since "they actually implement policies."  It was important </p><p>to make sure that they had a good foundation of knowledge so </p><p>that they could implement "grassroots democracy," another </p><p>major CPV theme over the past several years.  Training </p><p>provided by the provincial CPV academy was key to this.  The </p><p>school\'s curriculum follows a national model, but officials </p><p>emphasized that they took pains to make courses more focused </p><p>and interesting by illustrating issues with local subjects. </p><p>Over time, the academy\'s courses lead to a bachelor\'s degree </p><p>in "Theory and Philosophy."  Officials claimed that 90% (or </p><p>391) of provincial and district officials had received such </p><p>a degree already and that the remaining 10% were currently </p><p>working on it. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Director Tien of the CPV Personnel Committee for Bac </p><p>Ninh echoed the goals of cadre rotation:  to build </p><p>experience and to provide a better grasp of issues. </p><p>Rotation creates an opportunity for senior personnel to </p><p>excel in a new environment.  Those rotated are to be capable </p><p>of significant additional advancement, so the program is </p><p>primarily for officials under 45; those over the age of 50 </p><p>are not considered at all, he claimed.  However, he also </p><p>emphasized rotation\'s importance in fighting "regionalism, </p><p>localism, and branchism."  Preventing officials from </p><p>becoming too entrenched and connected to particular </p><p>interests is a major goal, like the supposed practice of </p><p>rotating customs officials every six months. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  In order to participate in cadre rotation, </p><p>officials must have a professional and a theoretical </p><p>(political) bachelor\'s degree, Bac Ninh officials explained. </p><p>The province is currently reviewing existing personnel plans </p><p>and determining what must be done to implement Resolution </p><p>Eleven more fully.  They explained their slow implementation </p><p>by claiming that Resolution Eleven\'s guidelines require </p><p>pilot projects first and that the Phu Tho conference had </p><p>been to review the lessons learned.  Now Bac Ninh was also </p><p>ready to move forward, provincial officials claimed. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Provincial officials added that some of the </p><p>greatest difficulties lie in administering the details, such </p><p>as how to deal with benefits and pensions, particularly when </p><p>one moves from one sector to another (e.g. from government </p><p>to mass organization to Party).  Tien noted that cadre </p><p>rotation should actually be relatively easy to implement </p><p>within Bac Ninh due to its small size.  One could feasibly </p><p>rotate between district and provincial levels without </p><p>changing residences -- something often not possible in </p><p>larger provinces such as Phu Tho. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>National Level Perspective </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Director General of the Personnel Management </p><p>Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) Tran Anh </p><p>Tuan, responsible for the management of all civil servants </p><p>throughout Vietnam, also reviewed cadre rotation with </p><p>poloffs.  He spoke primarily about the national/provincial- </p><p>level, but some of his remarks apply to the </p><p>provincial/district-level as well.  "High-level" personnel </p><p>make decisions about rotation, he admitted.  Variations in </p><p>living standards complicate implementation of these </p><p>decisions, however.  Officials are often reluctant to move </p><p>to remote and mountainous areas with limited educational and </p><p>cultural opportunities.  It is also difficult to find vacant </p><p>positions in "very popular places" such as Ho Chi Minh City. </p><p>Identifying personnel in remote provinces sufficiently </p><p>qualified for rotation is another challenge, he added.  Even </p><p>so, part of the reason for the program is to help narrow </p><p>gaps between different parts of the country by bringing </p><p>qualified people to serve in and be exposed to the problems </p><p>of difficult and remote areas, he explained. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>National/Local Tension </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Director General Tuan said that before the CPV had </p><p>reemphasized cadre rotation with Resolution Eleven, </p><p>provincial personnel decisions were left to individual </p><p>provinces.  He alleged that this often resulted in entire </p><p>provinces being "limited" by the sometimes-low capability of </p><p>the provincial chairman.  The usually close professional and </p><p>personal relationships between successive chairmen also </p><p>limited creativity, he said, a cycle that perpetuated </p><p>endemic weaknesses.  This also led to sentiments against </p><p>outsiders coming into a province -- another manifestation of </p><p>what Bac Ninh\'s Tien called "localism." </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  DG Tuan explained that the rotation system was </p><p>intended, in part, to break up this cycle and thus narrow </p><p>gaps between provinces.  He noted that while preparing </p><p>Resolution Eleven, Vietnam had studied personnel rotation </p><p>systems in non-Communist countries for the first time, </p><p>especially those in Japan and Singapore.  Vietnam did not </p><p>have the economic capability to follow those examples, with </p><p>rotations every two years, but was trying to use other </p><p>elements of their systems, he added. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  The rotation program has only been genuinely </p><p>underway for six months at the national level, so only a few </p><p>rotations have taken place and there has been no review yet, </p><p>according to DG Tuan.  Some provinces have not shown much </p><p>"adaptive capacity," he commented, so implementation has </p><p>been spotty.  Rotated officials need to be supported, for </p><p>instance in the provision of housing in the new location. </p><p>While this is less difficult at the national level, it is a </p><p>serious financial burden for many provinces, he pointed out. </p><p>Moreover, it is difficult for officials rotated to distant </p><p>provinces to stay far away from their families.  They tend </p><p>to return home every weekend, making it difficult for </p><p>officials to get to know their assigned provinces as well as </p><p>they should.  Furthermore, DG Tuan noted, this limits their </p><p>participation in the important informal relationship- </p><p>building and after-hours discussions of issues that </p><p>characterize GVN and CPV governance.  It was relatively easy </p><p>to rotate cadre during wartime, but officials are not so </p><p>willing during peace, he lamented. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U)  Comment:  Cadre rotation serves functions </p><p>including grooming a new generation of leaders, improving </p><p>leadership in backwater provinces, and perhaps hindering </p><p>corruption by breaking up local "mafias."  In order to be </p><p>effective in their new positions, rotated officials must be </p><p>sufficiently dynamic and collegial to overcome their </p><p>outsider status, however.  Presumably, this is not an </p><p>ineffective way to determine whether promising leaders are </p><p>fit for higher positions.  It is also a way for the CPV, </p><p>particularly its higher levels, to assert its control over </p><p>the outlook and composition of leadership, not only at the </p><p>national-level, but in the provinces too.  The tension </p><p>between local and central authority in Vietnam has a long </p><p>history;  rotation -- whether of Confucian mandarins or of </p><p>Communist cadres -- has been and is likely to remain an </p><p>important tool used by central authorities to break up real </p><p>and potentially competing local power structures. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
