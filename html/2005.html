<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002398 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KPAO, KISL, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NO CELEBRATIONS IN ZAMFARA: REPORTS INACCURATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA (B) ABUJA 2290 (C) ABUJA 2331 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: Post has investigated the story reported by a </p><p>BBC stringer in Gusau, capital of Zamfara State, that there </p><p>were celebrations there following the September 11 attack on </p><p>the U.S.  All sources indicate that this story was </p><p>exaggerated.  Reports of unrest in Kano on Friday, September </p><p>14, also appear to have been fabricated, according to reports </p><p>from private and official sources there.  This is a stressful </p><p>time in Nigeria, independent of events in the U.S.  At times </p><p>like this, Nigerian "news" reports can unfortunately be </p><p>intended more than ever to sell newspapers--through marketing </p><p>ethnic and religious prejudice--than to report objective </p><p>facts.  Unfortunately, irresponsible journalism can have </p><p>severe repercussions, in Nigeria and elsewhere.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Zamfara </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Poloff contacted the (Christian) Commissioner of Police </p><p>in Gusau, Aaron Ibiloye, on September 12, and he reported </p><p>that there had been no demonstrations whatsoever in Gusau on </p><p>the 11th, adding that most people in Gusau had been preparing </p><p>for the arrival of President Obasanjo on the 13th.  Political </p><p>Specialist contacted two long-term stringers in Zamfara, Sani </p><p>Abdullahi Tsafe (VOA) and Umaru Waziri (Reuters), to verify </p><p>the "jubilation" story.  They were both angry about the BBC </p><p>story, and reported that their BBC colleague could not </p><p>provide a source, or even a location for his story.  They </p><p>added that the BBC stringer, Ibrahim Dosara, was a recent </p><p>hire who, in reporting this story without adequate </p><p>investigation, failed to maintain proper standards of </p><p>journalistic professionalism.  No private citizen contacted </p><p>by Post could confirm the report.  Unfortunately, the damage </p><p>has been done, and Zamfara state has now been registered in </p><p>the U.S. consciousness--and that of the rest of the world-- </p><p>as one of a very few places where the attacks of September 11 </p><p>were publicly celebrated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Officials in Government House, Gusau, issued a press </p><p>release from Governor Ahmed Sani condemning the terrorist </p><p>attacks and denying any demonstrations in support of the </p><p>violence on September 11.  They indicated that the Governor </p><p>would have responded earlier but for President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>all-consuming, first visit to Zamfara on September 13-14. </p><p>Alhaji Mohammed Bello Umar, Permanent Secretary for Zamfara </p><p>State Government, called on Charge on September 19 to deliver </p><p>a letter and a personal message of condolence from Governor </p><p>Ahmed Sani.  Umar mentioned that the Governor was very upset </p><p>about the reports in the press.  He added that the BBC </p><p>stringer, Dosara, had disavowed sending in a story, saying </p><p>that he responded to a telephone call by BBC, which he </p><p>claimed then distorted what he said.  (Comment:  While some </p><p>radical Muslims in the North certainly may have been pleased </p><p>by the attacks, that is a long way from a public </p><p>demonstration, which is what BBC reported and some other </p><p>media picked up.  Because of Zamfara\'s notoriety as the first </p><p>state to adopt criminal Shari\'a, many Nigerians believe the </p><p>reports and dismiss the Government\'s denials.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Kano/Aba </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Embassy contacts in Kano have denied that there was </p><p>unrest there on Friday, September 14.  There were rumors of </p><p>violence, and more rumors of Muslims "jubilating" in Kano </p><p>over the September 11 attack on the U.S.  These rumors were </p><p>widely reported in the Lagos media, and almost universally </p><p>received as the truth in Southern Nigeria where the media and </p><p>population are predisposed to believing the worst about </p><p>Northerners,  especially Hausa who happen to be Muslim.   The </p><p>only confirmed violent incident in Kano was the burning of a </p><p>residence being used as a church in Shagari Quarters on </p><p>September 10.  According to the Commissioner of Police, this </p><p>resulted from a long-term conflict between neighbors turning </p><p>violent--and does not appear to have been a response either </p><p>to events in the U.S. or violence in Jos (REF B).  Governor </p><p>Kwankwaso himself castigated journalists assembled in Kano to </p><p>accompany Minister of Information Jerry Gana.  He reportedly </p><p>asked them, "Did you see smoke coming from the city?  Did you </p><p>see violence?  Then why did you write this?"  He exhorted </p><p>them to practice responsible journalism, rather than </p><p>ratcheting up ethnic tensions with falsehoods calculated to </p><p>sell newspapers.  Investigations by ConGen Lagos into reports </p><p>of violence in Aba, Abia State, proved that they were equally </p><p>fictitious.  (Note: Reprisal attacks in Aba following the </p><p>February 2000 riots in Kaduna reportedly resulted in over 500 </p><p>Hausa deaths there.  End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Abuja </p><p>----- </p><p>5.  Rumors that reprisal violence would erupt in Abuja over </p><p>the September 15-16 weekend had Nigerian and AmCit residents </p><p>of the Federal Capital Territory on edge.  Approximately 25 </p><p>missionaries who temporarily relocated from Plateau State to </p><p>Abuja in the wake of the Jos killings were particularly </p><p>concerned.  GON security was much tighter than usual in </p><p>Karmo, a sprawling unlicensed slum suburb of perhaps 250,000 </p><p>souls, after rumors circulated that churches there would be </p><p>attacked.  Many Karmo residents are refugees from the Kaduna </p><p>ethno-religious conflicts of February and May 2000, so there </p><p>is ample dry tinder there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Kaduna </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Sultan of Sokoto, sitting in Kaduna as chairman of </p><p>the Jama\'atu Nasril Islam (JNI), the leading Islamic </p><p>religious organization in Nigeria, issued a strong statement </p><p>condemning the terrorist attack against the U.S.  This </p><p>follows his statement, issued days after the attack, from </p><p>Sokoto as the foremost Muslim traditional ruler in Nigeria in </p><p>which he also condemned the attack.  Reports on unrest in </p><p>Kaduna over the weekend also appear to be without foundation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Comment:  Disregarding what has happened in the U.S., </p><p>this has been a very difficult few weeks for Nigeria.  Ganiyu </p><p>Adams, the leader of the OPC\'s militant wing was arrested, </p><p>sparking large protests by the OPC in Lagos.  This raised </p><p>tensions among Lagos\' Hausa, who fear a repeat of last </p><p>October\'s attacks in Ajegunle, in which over one hundred </p><p>Hausa are reported to have died.  Inter-ethnic violence in </p><p>Jos on September 7-9 apparently has claimed more lives than </p><p>last year\'s outbreaks in Kaduna, and Hausa refugees have left </p><p>Jos and other parts of Plateau State in the thousands. </p><p>Tensions are high, and rumors of planned reprisals by Muslims </p><p>are a constant drumbeat--even in cities as far away as Abuja, </p><p>Aba, and Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Comment Continued: In this context, irresponsible </p><p>journalism--printing inciting rumors as facts--is akin to </p><p>yelling "fire" in a crowded theater.  The press in Nigeria </p><p>has certainly undergone a renaissance since the return of </p><p>democracy, with an astonishing number of dailies and weekly </p><p>publications vying for readership.  No-one would accuse it of </p><p>being overly concerned with the truth, especially when a </p><p>story can serve to reinforce established prejudices.  While </p><p>some media sources here are more reliable than others, </p><p>publishers, reporters and those they interview view events </p><p>through the prism of collectively held ethnic, regional and </p><p>religious biases.  This tendency is only exacerbated during </p><p>times of crisis--when half-truths and falsehoods are most </p><p>incendiary.   This lack of professionalism has resulted in </p><p>many stories that purvey the accepted myths of a particular </p><p>group--in this case, the Southern myth that the Muslim </p><p>Northerners are happy about what has happened in the U.S. </p><p>While some Muslim extremists in Nigeria may be pleased by </p><p>events, there simply is no evidence available to us of public </p><p>celebrations or demonstrations.    End Comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
