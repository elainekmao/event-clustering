<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 MILAN 000338 </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR RESSLER </p><p>DEPT FOR S/CT, EUR/WE, EB/ESC, DRL/BA, INR/NESA, </p><p>NEA/ENA, PM/SRP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PINR, PINS, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, EFIN, ECON, </p><p>EIND, MARR, MOPS, IT, LY </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT:  QADHAFI\'S SON ON ITALY-LIBYA RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: SEIF QADHAFI, SON OF LIBYAN LEADER </p><p>MUAMMOR QADHAFI, SPOKE AT ISPI (INSTITUTE FOR THE </p><p>STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS) IN MILAN, JUNE 10 ON </p><p>"LIBYA AND ITALY: ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISSUES WITHIN </p><p>THE MEDITERRANEAN AREA."  SEIF QADHAFI, WHO WAS </p><p>INTRODUCED AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE "LIBYAN </p><p>HUMANITARIAN FOUNDATION, HEAD OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONSULTING GROUP," AND AN EXPERT ON BUSINESS </p><p>CONSULTING AND ARCHITECTURE, SPOKE ON THE OBLIGATION </p><p>FOR ITALIAN COMPENSATION FOR COLONIAL CRIMES AS ONE OF </p><p>THE PRECONDITIONS FOR BETTER RELATIONS BETWEEN NORTH </p><p>AFRICA AND EUROPE.  HE MENTIONED THE UNITED STATES </p><p>ONLY IN PASSING, SAYING THAT U.S. BASES IN ITALY </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ATTACK LIBYA AND THAT THERE WAS </p><p>NO EVIDENCE THAT HIS COUNTRY WAS INVOLVED IN </p><p>LOCKERBIE.  HE SAID THAT LIBYA\'S INVESTMENT IN FIAT </p><p>WAS STRICTLY A BUSINESS DECISION.  MANY OF HIS </p><p>STATEMENTS WERE ILLOGICAL, ALMOST BIZARRE, AND THE </p><p>ITALIAN AUDIENCE LEFT SOMEWHAT CONFUSED AND </p><p>UNIMPRESSED.  END INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ELIMINATE THIS BLACK SPOT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  SEIF QADHAFI BRIEFLY REVIEWED ANCIENT HISTORICAL </p><p>AND CULTURAL TIES BEFORE JUMPING TO ITALY\'S OCCUPATION </p><p>OF LIBYA.  HE REFERRED TO MASSACRES AND CONCENTRATION </p><p>CAMPS AND SAID THAT LIBYA IS STILL SUFFERING AND </p><p>PEOPLE ARE STILL DYING DUE TO WHAT ITALY DID.  THIS IS </p><p>THE REASON THAT LIBYA IS BACKWARD TODAY.  LATER IN HIS </p><p>TALK HE SAID THAT ONE MILLION LIBYANS WERE KILLED BY </p><p>THE ITALIANS, MANY IN CONCENTRATIONS CAMPS.  THERE IS </p><p>NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE DEATHS AND THE JEWISH </p><p>DEATHS IN WORLD WAR II CONCENTRATION CAMPS.  THE </p><p>QUESTION IS NOW HOW TO ELIMINATE THIS "BLACK SPOT." </p><p> </p><p>AND HERE IS WHAT ITALY HAS TO DO </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  QADHAFI SAID THAT A PERMANENT BILATERAL TREATY AND </p><p>COMPENSATION IS NECESSARY.  A SMALL HOSPITAL, SMALL </p><p>SCHOOL OR CLEARING THE MINEFIELDS IS NOT ENOUGH TO </p><p>ABOLISH THE BLACK SPOT.  WHAT ITALY SHOULD PROVIDE IS </p><p>EDUCATION AND INVESTMENT, EDUCATION BEING THE MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT.  ITALY SHOULD FINANCE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR </p><p>LIBYANS TO STUDY IN ITALY OR IN EUROPE, "AND NOT 10 OR </p><p>20 OR 80, BUT AN IMPORTANT NUMBER."  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>GOI SHOULD SPONSOR AN EXCHANGE OF PROFESSORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  QADHAFI SAID THE GOI CLAIMS THAT THEY HAVE NO </p><p>MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR COMPENSATION, BUT THIS CAN BE </p><p>SOLVED THROUGH INCREASED INVESTMENT INSTEAD. </p><p>INVESTMENT SHOULD BE DIRECT PRIVATE SECTOR TO PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR.  INVESTMENT FLOWS SHOULD NOT INVOLVE THE STATE </p><p>BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION: "LIBYA OR ITALY, IT </p><p>IS THE SAME THING."  HE STRESSED THIS AGAIN LATER IN </p><p>HIS TALK, SAYING THAT FUNDS SHOULD NOT BE CHANNELED </p><p>THROUGH THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF BUREAUCRATIC </p><p>INEFFICIENCY AND CORRUPTION.  MORE SPECIFICALLY, </p><p>QADHAFI PROPOSED THAT THE GOI GIVE TAX RELIEF TO </p><p>LIBYAN COMPANIES THAT LOCATE IN ITALY, ITALIAN </p><p>COMPANIES THAT INVEST IN ITALY, OR ITALIAN BANKS WHO </p><p>MAKE LOANS TO LIBYAN COMPANIES.  THIS, QADHAFI CLAIMED </p><p>WOULD NOT COST ANYTHING TO THE ITALIAN BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TRYING TO MAKE THE MORAL ARGUMENT FOR </p><p>COMPENSATION, QADHAFI SAID THIS IS WHAT SWITZERLAND </p><p>DID FOR ISRAEL; SO THE SAME THING SHOULD BE DONE BY </p><p>ITALY FOR LIBYA.  HIS VOICE RISING, GADDAFI SAID, "WE </p><p>HAVE A RIGHT TO BE COMPENSATED.  MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY </p><p>DIED IN THAT WAR."  HE WENT ON TO CLAIM THAT FRANCE </p><p>WAS PRESSURING ITALY NOT TO DO ANYTHING FOR LIBYA </p><p>BECAUSE THEN FRANCE WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO DO THE SAME </p><p>THING FOR ALGERIA.  HE NOTED THAT PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI HAS BEEN INVITED TO LIBYA, BUT HE CANNOT </p><p>VISIT UNTIL THE COMPENSATION ISSUE IS RESOLVED, HE </p><p>ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR BETTER RELATIONS WITH EUROPE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  SHIFTING FROM BILATERAL RELATIONS TO REGIONAL </p><p>RELATIONS, HE SAID THAT AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN NORTH </p><p>AFRICAN NATIONS AND THE EU DEPENDED ON CERTAIN </p><p>PRECONDITIONS.  FIRST, EACH SIDE MUST AGREE NOT TO USE </p><p>THEIR TERRITORIES AS A BASE TO ATTACK EACH OTHER. </p><p>THAT MEANS, FOR INSTANCE, THE U.S. COULD NOT USE BASES </p><p>IN ITALY TO ATTACK LIBYA.  SECOND, THE EU SHOULD LIFT </p><p>ITS MILITARY EMBARGO ON LIBYA.  BOTH OF THESE ARE </p><p>VITAL FOR LIBYAN SECURITY AND ARE PRECONDITIONS FOR </p><p>NEGOTIATION.  LATER, HE COMMENTED THAT NATO EXPANSION </p><p>TO THE SOUTH (TO INCLUDE LIBYA) WOULD BE "WISE, A VERY </p><p>GOOD IDEA." </p><p> </p><p>7.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION, NORTH AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES MUST SUPPORT DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  IF </p><p>THERE WERE DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN NORTH AFRICA, </p><p>THERE WOULD BE "NO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION" AND "NO BOMBS </p><p>IN PARIS."  HE LATER CONDEMNED "FAKE DEMOCRACY" IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, WHERE LEADERS CONSTANTLY ARE ELECTED WITH </p><p>99 PERCENT OF THE VOTE.  "ONE LEADER RULING FOREVER IS </p><p>NOT DEMOCRACY," HE SAID (WITHOUT IRONY). </p><p> </p><p>8.  TURNING TO IMMIGRATION, QADHAFI NOTED THAT ILLEGAL </p><p>IMMIGRATION IS A BIG PROBLEM IN LIBYA.  ILLEGAL </p><p>IMMIGRANTS ENTER HIS COUNTRY, CAUSING PROBLEMS AND </p><p>COMMITTING CRIMES BEFORE MOVING ON TO ITALY.  BECAUSE </p><p>THE MAJOR VICTIM OF IMMIGRATION IS ITALY, ROME SHOULD </p><p>HELP LIBYA WITH JOBS AND INVESTMENT TO KEEP THESE </p><p>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OUT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIBYA AND FIAT: STRICTLY BUSINESS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  QADHAFI SAID LIBYA\'S RECENT INVESTMENT IN FIAT WAS </p><p>A STRAIGHT BUSINESS DEAL.  THE GOVERNMENT PURCHASED A </p><p>PIECE OF FIAT THROUGH A GOL INVESTMENT COMPANY.  IT </p><p>WAS A NORMAL INVESTMENT: "WE HAVE LOTS OF EXTRA HARD </p><p>CURRENCY," HE SAID.  (NOTE:  ACCORDING TO THE ITALIAN </p><p>FINANCIAL PRESS, IN FEBRUARY 2002, THE LIBYAN ARAB </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANY, LAFICO, PURCHASED 2 </p><p>PERCENT OF FIAT.  EARLIER, LAFICO PURCHASED </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 5 PERCENT OF SOCCER CLUB JUVENTUS, WHICH </p><p>LIKE FIAT IS CONTROLLED BY THE AGNELLI FAMILY.  SIEF </p><p>QADHAFI IS A BIG FAN OF JUVENTUS AND IS SOMETIMES SEEN </p><p>AT THEIR GAMES.  COMMENT: SO FAR, THE JUVENTUS </p><p>INVESTMENT HAS TURNED OUT BETTER THAN THE FIAT </p><p>INVESTMENT.  WHILE FIAT IS IN SERIOUS FINANCIAL </p><p>TROUBLE, JUVENTUS WON THE ITALIAN A LEAGUE </p><p>CHAMPIONSHIP IN MAY.  END COMMENT.  LAFICO IS ALSO </p><p>SAID TO OWN SMALL PIECES OF ENI AND TELECOM ITALIA. </p><p>THE LIBYAN ARAB FOREIGN BANK ALSO OWNS 5 PERCENT OF </p><p>BANCA DI ROMA.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>LOCKERBIE </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  QADHAFI DID NOT BRING UP LOCKERBIE HIMSELF, BUT </p><p>RESPONDING TO A QUESTION FROM THE AUDIENCE HE SAID </p><p>THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT LIBYA WAS BEHIND </p><p>LOCKERBIE.  LIBYA WAS CONDEMNED BEFORE THE TRIAL AND </p><p>THIS IS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ARABS.  BESIDES, MANY </p><p>OF THE VICTIMS\' FAMILIES DO NOT THINK THAT THE </p><p>CONVICTED MAN IS GUILTY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT:  THE SPEECH WAS DELIVERED TO AN </p><p>INTERESTED, OVERFLOW CROWD.  HOWEVER, QADHAFI PROBABLY </p><p>DID LITTLE TO ADVANCE ITALIAN-LIBYAN RELATIONS. </p><p>SPEAKING IN ENGLISH, SOFTLY ALMOST INAUDIBLY AT FIRST, </p><p>HE QUICKLY PICKED UP PACE AND VOLUME WHEN HE BEGAN TO </p><p>TALK ABOUT ITALIAN WAR CRIMES AGAINST LIBYA.  HE </p><p>SEEMED FIXATED ON THE NEED FOR ITALIAN REPARATIONS AND </p><p>HIS TALK WAS FULL OF UNREALISTIC, ILLOGICAL AND </p><p>SOMETIMES BIZARRE ASSERTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. </p><p>NEAR THE END HE STARTED TO RAMBLE, AND SOME OF HIS </p><p>STATEMENTS WERE NONSENSICAL, BUT THAT TO COULD HAVE </p><p>BEEN DUE TO LANGUAGE PROBLEMS.  AT THE END, THE </p><p>AUDIENCE ONLY ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS, CLAPPED POLITELY </p><p>AND QUICKLY FILED OUT, A FEW SHAKING THEIR HEADS. </p><p>THEY SEEMED MOST UNIMPRESSED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCELHANEY </p><p></p></div>
