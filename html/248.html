<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 12430 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: 1988 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 357278 </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SECTION I - UNCLASSIFIED </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  THERE FOLLOWS DRAFT VERSION OF THE SAUDI ARABIAN </p><p>SUBMISSION TO THE 1988 REPORT TO CONGRESS ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, KEYED TO REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL POSTS-- </p><p> </p><p>-     A. RESULTS OF 1988 COURT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>-     FOLLOWING BOMBINGS IN MARCH AND APRIL AT TWO </p><p>INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES AT RAS TANURA AND JUBAIL, IN THE </p><p>EASTERN PROVINCE, AND THE DISMANTLING OF ANOTHER BOMB AT </p><p>RAS TANURA, THREE YOUNG MEN WERE ARRESTED AT QATIF IN </p><p>EARLY AUGUST AFTER A GUN BATTLE WITH POLICE.  THE THREE </p><p>AND AN ACCOMPLICE WERE CHARGED WITH TERRORISM, SABOTAGE, </p><p>CONSPIRING WITH IRAN, AND, IN THE CASE OF TWO, MURDER. </p><p>THEY WERE TRIED IN CLOSED SESSION, ACCORDING TO SAUDI </p><p>LAW, DURING SEPTEMBER OF 1988, FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED </p><p>TO DEATH.  PRIOR TO THE EXECUTION, AUTHORITIES RECEIVED </p><p>THREATS FROM AN UNKNOWN GROUP CALLING ITSELF "HIZBOLLAH </p><p>OF THE HEJAZ".  AFTER REVIEW OF THE SENTENCES BY THE </p><p>KING, THE EXECUTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT BY DECAPITATION ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 30.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, AUTHORITIES RECEIVED </p><p>THREATS OF RETALIATION FROM AN ALSO-UNKNOWN "ISLAMIC </p><p>JIHAD OF THE HIJAZ", POSSIBLY THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS </p><p>GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>-     B. STATUS OF THE PLO IN THE HOST COUNTRY: </p><p> </p><p>-     THE STATUS OF THE PLO IN SAUDI ARABIA DID NOT </p><p>CHANGE DURING 1988.  THE PLO MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC </p><p>REPRESENTATION IN THE KINGDOM, WITH A MISSION NEAR </p><p>RIYADH\'S DIPLOMATIC QUARTER.  SAUDI ARABIA WAS ONE OF THE </p><p>FIRST COUNTRIES TO RECOGNIZE THE DECLARATION OF A </p><p>PALESTINIAN STATE ISSUED BY THE PNC IN NOVEMBER, 1988. </p><p> </p><p>-     C. STATEMENTS BY THE HOST COUNTRY IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>TERRORISM OR TERRORISM-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES: </p><p> </p><p>-     SAUDI ARABIA DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH STATEMENTS </p><p>DURING 1988.  IN FACT, HIGH OFFICIALS CONDEMNED TERRORISM </p><p>ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, MOST NOTICABLY IN THE CASE OF </p><p>THE KUWAITI AIRLINER HIJACKING IN APRIL, WHICH INVOLVED </p><p>SAUDI CITIZENS.  AS IN THAT CASE, THEY HAVE GENERALLY </p><p>CONDEMNED TERRORIST ACTS CARRIED OUT IN THE NAME OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAUSE WHILE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT </p><p>OF A PALESTINIAN STATE. </p><p> </p><p>3. SPECIFIC POST REPORTING REQUIREMENTS-- </p><p> </p><p>-     A. REVIEW OF MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS IN CY </p><p>1988: </p><p> </p><p>-     SAUDI ARABIA CONTINUED TO SPEAK OUT STRONGLY AND </p><p>VOTE AGAINST TERRORISM IN 1988 ON ALL APPROPRIATE </p><p>OCCASIONS.  IN THE FIELD OF ANTI-TERRORISM TRAINING, WEST </p><p>GERMAN SPECIALIST GEN. ULRICH WEGENER ARRIVED IN JUNE TO </p><p>BEGIN ADVANCED TRAINING FOR THE ANTI-TERRORISM FORCES OF </p><p>THE SAUDI SPECIAL SECURITY FORCE, FOUNDED IN 1979.  THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALSO SENT AN OFFICER TO A US </p><p>SEMINAR ON NEGOTIATING IN HOSTAGE SITUATIONS.  FOLLOWING </p><p>THE EASTERN PROVINCE BOMBINGS, INDUSTRIAL SECURITY WAS </p><p>CONSIDERABLY TIGHTENED, AND CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF </p><p>EMPLOYEES WERE PUT UNDER INCREASED SURVEILLANCE.  THE </p><p>SAUDIS ALSO TOOK ELABORATE SECURITY PREPARATIONS FOR THE </p><p>1988 HAJJ (THE ANNUAL PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA AND MEDINA) IN </p><p>VIEW OF THE RIOTS CAUSED BY IRANIAN PILGRIMS THE YEAR </p><p>BEFORE.  THE HAJJ WENT SMOOTHLY.  MONTHS AFTER THE HAJJ, </p><p>THE PRESS REPORTED THAT ARMS HAD BEEN CONFISCATED FROM A </p><p>FEW PILGRIMS. </p><p> </p><p>-     B. RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM: </p><p> </p><p>-     IN AUGUST, THE ULEMA (THE NATIONAL BODY OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS JURISTS) ANNOUNCED PROMULGATION OF A NEW LAW </p><p>DEFINING SABOTAGE AS A MAJOR CRIME FOR WHICH THE DEATH </p><p>PENALTY WAS POSSIBLE; THE DEFINITION OF SABOTAGE IN THE </p><p>LAW INCLUDED HIJACKING OR BOMBING AIRPLANES.  THIS LAW </p><p>WAS REFERRED TO REPEATEDLY IN THE MEDIA DURING THE TRIAL </p><p>AND EXECUTION OF THE MEN ARRESTED FOR THE EASTERN </p><p>PROVINCE BOMBINGS, ALTHOUGH THEIR CRIMES WERE COMMITTED </p><p>BEFORE THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT.  A ROYAL DECREE, WHICH </p><p>WAS NEVER OFFICIALLY PROMULGATED BUT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE </p><p>SAUDI PRESS, IMPOSED SIMILAR PENALTIES FOR DEMONSTRATING </p><p>DURING THE HAJJ, ENGAGING IN TERRORIST ACTS, OR OTHERWISE </p><p>ATTEMPTING DISRUPTION OF THE PILGRIMAGE.  SAUDI OFFICIALS </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT HESITATE TO APPLY THESE </p><p>LAWS FULLY IF NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>-     C. SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC </p><p>SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>-     THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM AND HAS REPEATEDLY SPOKEN AND VOTED AGAINST </p><p>TERORIST ACTS IN INTERNATIONAL FORA.  SAUDI OFFICIALS </p><p>MAKE A CAREFUL DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM </p><p>AND SUPPORT OF THE PLO, WHICH THEY CONSIDER A LEGITIMATE </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  WHILE DECRYING ACTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED IN THE NAME OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS, SAUDI ARABIA SUPPORTS THE PLO BOTH </p><p>POLITICALLY AND FINANCIALLY (INDEED, IT IS ONE OF THAT </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S LEADING DONORS), AND WAS ONE OF THE FIRST </p><p>NATIONS TO EXTEND DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION TO THE NEW </p><p>PALESTINIAN "STATE."  SAUDI ARABIA IS NOT A KNOWN </p><p>SANCTUARY FOR TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>SECTION II - CONFIDENTIAL </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. IN REGARD TO PARAGRAPH 2, PART A, A POLICE SOURCE IN </p><p>THE EASTERN PROVINCE HAS TOLD US THAT SEVERAL MORE </p><p>PERSONS SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY IN THE JUBAIL AND RAS </p><p>TANURA BOMBINGS ARE STILL BEING HELD BY THE SAUDI GENERAL </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE (GID) WHILE INVESTIGATION OF </p><p>THE CASE CONTINUES.  THUS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FURTHER </p><p>TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE.  AT LEAST ONE OF </p><p>THESE SUSPECTS IS SAID TO BE A SHIA OF LEBANESE ORIGIN, </p><p>LEADING SAUDI POLICE TO BELIEVE THAT "HIZBOLLAH OF THE </p><p>HIJAZ" AND "ISLAMIC JIHAD OF THE HIJAZ" ARE ONLY </p><p>SURROGATES FOR THE LEBANESE HIZBOLLAH ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CUTLER </p><p></p></div>
