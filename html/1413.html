(C) IN THE COURSE OF A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION ON </p><p>ANOTHER MATTER DECEMBER 7 WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN PERMANENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UNITED NATIONS, TICHAONA JOKONYA, </p><p>I LEARNED THAT ZIMBABWE WOULD SUPPORT THE USG POSITION </p><p>ON UN SCALES OF REFORM.  THE SENIOR ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMAT </p><p>CLAIMED THAT HE HAD AUTONOMY TO VOTE AS HE PLEASED.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT ON MORE ORDINARY MATTERS ZIMBABWE FOLLOWS </p><p>THE G-77 OR NONALIGNED MOVEMENT.  HOWEVER, ON IMPORTANT </p><p>QUESTIONS, SUCH AS UN SCALES OF ASSESSMENT REFORM, THE </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES IS THE MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT FACTOR.  JOKONYA EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD CONSULTED </p><p>WITH THE NAMIBIANS, WHO STILL HOLDS A SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>SEAT FOR THE AFRICAN BLOC, AND REPORTED THAT NAMIBIA TOO </p><p>WOULD SUPPORT THE USG POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: I HAVE FOUND JOKONYA TO BE A RELIABLE </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR IN THE PAST.  HIS SANGUINE ASSURANCES WOULD </p><p>APPEAR TO RUN COUNTER TO WHAT HIS HEADQUARTERS THINKS, </p><p>HOWEVER.  IT AIN\'T OVER TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS, AND I </p><p>HOPE THIS ONE WILL PUT ON A VIRTUOSO PERFORMANCE FOR OUR </p><p>EARS WHEN THE TIME COMES.
