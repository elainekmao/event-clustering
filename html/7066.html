<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002165 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, AJ, GG, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: BOTAS GENERAL MANAGER BILDACI DISCHARGED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 1967 B) ANKARA 1448 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting Econ Couns Robert Silverman, Reason 1.5 </p><p>(b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The Ministry of Energy has officially dismissed Gokhan </p><p>Bildaci from his position as Chairman and General Manager of </p><p>BOTAS, the state pipeline company.  This move has been </p><p>expected since the AK government took over in November 2002. </p><p>Bildaci told econoff he learned about his dismissal when he </p><p>saw it published in the Official Gazette today, April 3.  He </p><p>is expected to depart from his office today.  No successor </p><p>has been named. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BP,s local BTC Co Managing Director Yashar Latifov </p><p>(strictly protect) told econoff that the timing of Bildaci,s </p><p>departure was bad, given that the project is moving into the </p><p>construction phase and that operational problems have not yet </p><p>been resolved (reftels).  However, he said, BP has long </p><p>expected Bildaci,s removal, and therefore has done some </p><p>contingency planning.  One option, Latifov said, was for </p><p>Bildaci to replace BOTAS,s BTC subsidiary company\'s current </p><p>Managing Director, who BP believes is incompetent.  Latifov </p><p>indicated that BP was looking at the legal ways in which this </p><p>switch might happen.  Another BP exec told econoff that, in </p><p>effect, BP likely will handle management of BTC construction </p><p>during this transition phase. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment:  Neither of the BP execs with whom we spoke </p><p>were panicked about this development.  Although BP execs </p><p>clearly respect and trust Bildaci, and strongly preferred </p><p>that he stay on, they have been planning for his removal.  In </p><p>our view, this is another blip that may have some temporary </p><p>impact on BTC construction, but should not significantly </p><p>delay the project. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
