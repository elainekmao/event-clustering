<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001556 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, KNNP, IR, CA, Iran </p><p>SUBJECT: IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM: CANADA PUSHING HARD </p><p> </p><p>REF: ATHENS 1834 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>SEE ACTION REQUEST PARA 5. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canadian Foreign Minister Graham met with Iranian FM </p><p>Kharazzi May 24 in Paris, and stressed Canada\'s strong </p><p>concerns over the Iranian nuclear program.  Terry Wood, </p><p>Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for Non-Proliferation, said </p><p>Graham told Kharazzi that Iran\'s May 6 presentation at the </p><p>IAEA gave the impression that Iran was being unhelpful and </p><p>non-transparent.  Graham gave Kharazzi a paper (faxed to </p><p>NEA/NGA) urging Iranian cooperation with the IAEA and </p><p>adoption of the additional protocol, and posing a number of </p><p>questions about the Iranian program.  Kharazzi responded that </p><p>the GoI was being as transparent as possible and would have </p><p>no problem "in principle" signing the additional protocol, </p><p>but that the additional protocol was controversial in Tehran. </p><p> Kharazzi gave Graham the same paper on Iranian "Peaceful </p><p>Nuclear Activities" that he presented to Greek FM Papandreou </p><p>(reftel) and others. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In addition to Graham\'s meeting with Kharazzi, Wood </p><p>told us that senior Canadian officials have demarched Iranian </p><p>counterparts three other times during the past two weeks. </p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Lavertu met with Iranian Deputy </p><p>Foreign Minister Ahani (Europe and America) on May 24 in </p><p>Tehran; Director General for International Security Jill </p><p>Sinclair called in Iranian Ambassador Mousavi for a meeting </p><p>on May 28 in Ottawa; and Canadian Ambassador McKinnon met </p><p>with Iranian Director General Ziamaninia </p><p>(Political/International Affairs) on May 18 in Tehran.  The </p><p>Iranian MFA took three weeks before agreeing to the meeting </p><p>with Ziamaninia. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Iranian response in all meetings was that they are </p><p>being open and doing nothing to violate their safeguards </p><p>obligations.  But DG Ziamaninia admitted that they had not </p><p>declared their heavy water enrichment facility sooner because </p><p>they did not want to come under increased scrutiny. </p><p>Ziamaninia said that Kharazzi and the head of the Iranian </p><p>Atomic Energy Organization had been tasked to identify </p><p>measures, including the additional protocol, that would </p><p>address international concerns.  Deputy Minister Ahani </p><p>repeated an Iranian offer, made after the El-Baradei visit to </p><p>Tehran, to develop an action plan with the IAEA to </p><p>demonstrate their cooperation and transparency. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Iranian officials tried to portray the U.S. as the </p><p>problem, calling the U.S. questions at the May 6 IAEA session </p><p>"sensational."  They told the Canadians that even if they </p><p>were to sign the additional protocol, the U.S. would not be </p><p>satisfied.  Ahani stressed that there was much debate over </p><p>the additional protocol, including among National Assembly </p><p>members, and that Iran would only sign the additional </p><p>protocol if doing so would relieve international pressure. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ACTION REQUEST: Wood told us that Canada was eager to </p><p>hear what our Iran strategy will be for the June 16 IAEA </p><p>Board of Governors meeting, and then for the IAEA General </p><p>Conference in September (including the possibility of a </p><p>resolution).  Please advise. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
