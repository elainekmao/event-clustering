POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS ORDERED ALL THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S </p><p>CARDINALS TO ROME IN MAY TO DISCUSS POLICY ISSUES. CALLED AN </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY CONSISTORY, THE MAY 21-24 MEETING WILL ANALYZE </p><p>THE WAY THE POPE EXERCISES HIS AUTHORITY AND HOW THE WORLD\'S </p><p>BISHOPS SHARE IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. </p><p>VATICAN WATCHERS SUGGEST THE MEETING MIGHT ALSO ADDRESS THE </p><p>STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND OTHER </p><p>CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN THE HOPE OF RE-ESTABLISHING FULL </p><p>UNITY. POPE JOHN PAUL HAS REGULARLY INSISTED ON THE PRIORITY </p><p>OF CHRISTIAN UNITY. AN EVENTUAL "RE-PHRASING" BY THE WORLD\'S </p><p>CARDINALS OF HOW PAPAL AUTHORITY IS EXERCISED MAY MAKE IT </p><p>LESS OF A PROBLEM FOR OTHER CHRISTIAN CHURCHES, ESPECIALLY </p><p>THE ORTHODOX, TO ACCEPT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>VATICAN AND MOSLEMS CALL FOR PEACE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01192  01 OF 02  022245Z </p><p>3.   A VATICAN DELEGATION MET IN CAIRO, EGYPT FEBRUARY 24 </p><p>WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ISLAM BASED AT AL-ALZHAR UNIVERSITY. </p><p>THE VATICAN\'S INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE SPECIALIST, BISHOP </p><p>MICHAEL FITZGERALD, SAID THE MEETING FOCUSED IN PART ON "THE </p><p>DETERIORATING SITUATION ON THE MIDDLE EAST." A STATEMENT </p><p>RELEASED BY THE VATICAN SAID MOSLEM REPRESENTATIVES JOINED </p><p>ITS OWN DELEGATION IN CALLING FOR AN END TO THE ISRAELI- </p><p>PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY IN "UNJUSTLY OCCUPIED" </p><p>PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. THE JOINT STATEMENT AFFIRMED THE </p><p>SPECIAL CHARACTER OF JERUSALEM AS SACRED TO ALL THREE </p><p>MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONS, AND CONDEMNED BREACHES OF THE </p><p>PRINCIPLE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, PARTICULARLY THE BLOCKING OF </p><p>ACCESS TO THE HOLY PLACES. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>PAPAL APPEAL FOR AFGHANISTAN </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   POPE JOHN PAUL II APPEALED TO THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY ON BEHALF OF DROUGHT AND CIVIL WAR VICTIMS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS FEBRUARY 28 GENERAL </p><p>AUDIENCE IN VATICAN CITY, THE POPE DECLARED THAT "A GRAVE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY IS OCCURRING IN AFGHANISTAN." HE SAID </p><p>THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, THE SICK AND THE </p><p>ELDERLY, WERE DYING OF HUNGER AND COLD. THE POPE EXPRESSED </p><p>HIS APPRECIATION FOR THE EFFORTS OF HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN THE REGION. HE APPEALED TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "NOT TO FORGET THIS TRAGIC </p><p>SITUATION," AND URGED ALL PARTIES IN "A WAR WHICH HAS BEEN </p><p>TOO LONG AND BLOODY" TO ARRANGE AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE TO </p><p>ALLOW AID TO REACH PEOPLE MOST AT RISK. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01192  01 OF 02  022245Z </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>IRAQI PATRIARCH DECLARES SADDAM CAPABLE OF RETALIATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>5.   PATRIARCH RAPHAEL BIDAWID OF BAGHDAD DECLARED THAT </p><p>RENEWED BOMBINGS OF MILITARY TARGETS BY US AND BRITISH </p><p>AIRCRAFT COULD PUSH SADDAM HUSSEIN "TO RETALIATE OUT OF </p><p>DESPERATION." IN AN FEBRUARY 25 INTERVIEW WITH VATICAN NEWS </p><p>AGENCY "FIDES," BIDAWID OPINED THAT "THE WHOLE OF THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD IS NOW AGAINST THE AMERICANS AND THE BRITISH, AND </p><p>READY TO COMMIT VIOLENCE AGAINST THE USA AND BRITAIN IN </p><p>THEIR OWN COUNTRIES." THE PATRIARCH SAID THAT THE MORE </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN IS "MALTREATED", THE GREATER THE SUPPORT HE </p><p>RECEIVES FROM ORDINARY IRAQIS. BIDAWID CALLED FOR A "SERIOUS </p><p>DIALOGUE" AND DECLARED THAT AIR STRIKES WOULD ONLY LEAD TO </p><p>MORE VIOLENCE. ACCORDING TO THE CATHOLIC LEADER, WESTERNERS </p><p>DO NOT APPRECIATE THE ARAB MENTALITY AND THAT IF AN ARAB\'S </p><p>DIGNITY IS OFFENDED "HE WILL BE AS FEROCIOUS AS A LION." </p><p>BIDAWID SAID "IT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE" THAT </p><p>ECONOMIC SANCTIONS DIRECTED AT IRAQ HAVE NOT WEAKENED SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN\'S CONTROL OVER THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9417 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01192  02 OF 02  022246Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SA-00    PMB-00   PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------CCEE35  022246Z /69 </p><p>R 021145Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0000 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SANTO DOMINGO </p><p>AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 001192 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

UKRAINE\'S NEWLY CREATED CARDINAL LUBOMYR HUSAR WANTS TO </p><p>"REASON WITH" HIS ORTHODOX CHURCH COUNTERPARTS WHO OBJECT TO </p><p>A PAPAL VISIT IN JUNE. SPEAKING AT A FEBRUARY 22 PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE IN VATICAN CITY, HUSAR SAID CATHOLICS IN UKRAINE </p><p>HAVE THE SAME CULTURE, HISTORY, CHURCH STRUCTURE, THEOLOGY </p><p>AND DISCIPLINE AS THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. HUSAR ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THE TENSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ORTHODOX CHURCH LEADERS BUT SAID </p><p>THE SITUATION "IS NOT A STALEMATE." ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>CARDINAL, THERE ARE TWO COMPLICATING FACTORS. THE FIRST IS </p><p>THE GROWING STRENGTH OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN UKRAINE, </p><p>WHICH AFTER YEARS OF COMMUNIST REPRESSION IS "REBOUNDING </p><p>WITH VIGOROUS HEALTH" AND IS ACCUSED BY THE ORTHODOX OF </p><p>COMPETING FOR SOULS.  SECONDLY, HUSAR SAID, THE ORTHODOX </p><p>LEADERSHIP IS SPLINTERED AND THE MOSCOW PATRIARCHATE FEARS </p><p>THAT A PAPAL VISIT MIGHT LEND CREDIBILITY TO ORTHODOX </p><p>LEADERS OTHER THAN THE ONES BACKED BY MOSCOW. (NOTE: THE </p><p>VATICAN HAS SAID POPE JOHN PAUL II WILL BE VISITING CATHOLIC </p><p>FAITHFUL AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY INSENSITIVE INITIATIVES </p><p>TOWARDS ORTHODOX LEADERS. END NOTE). CARDINAL HUSAR POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT IN THE PAST THE COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MACHINE HAD </p><p>PORTRAYED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS A TOOL OF THE WEST </p><p>DEDICATED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET STATE, AND THAT </p><p>THE LINGERING EFFECTS OF THAT MESSAGE MAKE MANY UKRAINIANS </p><p>UNEASY ABOUT THE CHURCH. HUSAR OPINED THAT THE UKRAINIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT BACKED THE PAPAL VISIT AS A "MEANS OF DRAWING THE </p><p>COUNTRY CLOSER TO THE OTHER NATIONS OF EUROPE." </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01192  02 OF 02  022246Z </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>AMCIT APPOINTED AS PAPAL NUNCIO </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS APPOINTED AMCIT VATICAN DIPLOMAT, </p><p>MONSIGNOR TIMOTHY BROGLIO, AS PAPAL REPRESENTATIVE TO THE </p><p>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND PUERTO RICO. THE 49-YEAR-OLD </p><p>CLEVELAND NATIVE WILL BE ORDAINED AN ARCHBISHOP BY THE POPE </p><p>IN A MARCH 19 VATICAN CITY CEREMONY. AT PRESENT, BROGLIO IS </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF FOR VATICAN SECRETARY OF STATE (PRIME </p><p>MINISTER EQUIVALENT), CARDINAL ANGELO SODANO. HE WAS </p><p>ORDAINED A PRIEST IN 1977 AND HAS A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN </p><p>CHURCH LAW. BROGLIO ENTERED THE VATICAN\'S DIPLOMATIC SERVICE </p><p>IN 1983 AND HAS SERVED IN IVORY COAST AND PARAGUAY, AS WELL </p><p>AS AT THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY. HE SPEAKS FRENCH, </p><p>ITALIAN AND SPANISH.
