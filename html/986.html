RAPHEL, AMBASSAD0R, REASON </p><p>1.5, B AND D </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  0N JANUARY 22, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER </p><p>ABDELWAHEB ABDALLAH T0LD AMBASSAD0R RAPHEL THE GOT </p><p>H0PED TO USE PRESIDENT BEN ALI\'S UPCOMING VISIT T0 </p><p>WASHINGTON T0 PR0MOTE TUNISIA\'S IMAGE AS A T0LERANT, </p><p>OPEN ISLAMIC C0UNTRY AND MODERATE, C0NSTRUCTIVE ACTOR </p><p>ON SUCH REGI0NAL ISSUES AS THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE </p><p>PROCESS (MEPP).  AMBASSADOR POINTED 0UT THAT, IN </p><p>ADDITI0N TO THESE IMP0RTANT THEMES, HEN ALI SHOULD BE </p><p>PREPARED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON M0RE C0NTR0VERSIAL </p><p>ISSUES SUCH AS THE LONG-PENDING VISA REQUEST FOR THE </p><p>DESIGNATED NEW ISRAELI INTERESTS SECTI0N HEAD. </p><p>ABDALLAH, WHO PRAISED U.S. TRADITION OF A FREE PRESS, </p><p>REITERATED BEN ALI\'S COMMITMENT T0 M0RE OPEN MEDIA, </p><p>BUT CRITICIZED RESISTANCE AM0NG S0ME G0T OFFICIALS AND </p><p>"SELF-CENS0RING" J0URNALISTS.  AMBASSAD0R STRESSED </p><p>NEED FOR BEN ALI TO DISCUSS TUNISIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SITUATION FRANKLY AND OPENLY BEFORE U.S. AUDIENCES. </p><p>ABDALLAH T0OKQOINT, BUT ALLEGED THAT THERE WERE </p><p>"MANY EXAGGERATIONS" IN CRITICISMS BY FOREIGN NG0\'S OF </p><p>G0T\'S HUMAN RIGHTS REC0RD.  HE CITED, AS EVIDENCE OF </p><p>BEN ALI\'S COMMITMENT To DEMOCRATIZATION, MEASURES TO </p><p>ENSURE MULTIPLE CANDIDATES IN THIS YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION AND TO RESERVE AT LEAST 20 PERCENT OF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY Q F0R THE OPPOSITION IN THE 1999 </p><p>LEGISLATIVE CONTEST. AMBASSADOR MADE A PITCH FOR </p><p>RELEASE OF IMPRISONED TUNISIAN HUMAN RIGHTS LEAGUE HEAD </p><p>KHEMAIS KSILA BEFORE THE PRESIDENT\'S VISIT; ABDALLAH </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS KSILA\'S REFUSAL TO SUBMIT </p><p>THE REQUIRED STANDARD LETTER TO BEN ALI REQUESTING </p><p>CLEMENCY.  IN THIS WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION, ABDALLAH </p><p>CAME ACR0SS AS A SMOOTH, SAVVY MEMBER OF BEN ALI\'S INNER </p><p>CIRCLE WHO DOUBTLESS WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN MOLDING BEN </p><p>ALI\'S AGENDA FOR HIS WASHINGTON VISIT.  BIO DETAILS IN </p><p>PARA 13.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>HEN ALI\'S WASHINGTON VISIT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN JANUARY 22 MEETING, AMBASSADOR INFORMED GOT </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR AND SPOKESMAN (MINISTERIAL RANK) </p><p>ABDELWAHEB ABDALLAH THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD FIXED </p><p>MARCH 23 AS THE DATE FOR PRESIDENT BEN ALI\'S OFFICIAL </p><p>WORKING VISIT.  ABDALLAH, WHO CONFIRMED THAT HE WOULD </p><p>BE A MEMBER OF BEN ALI\'S DELEGATION, INDICATED C0NCERN </p><p>THAT THERE BE FULL MEDIA TREATMENT OF THE VISIT. </p><p>ABDALLAH SAID HE HAD MET THE PREVI0US WEEK WITH THE </p><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS REPRESENTATIVE IN PARIS, AND THE </p><p>LATTER HAD EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PREPARING A PRE-VISIT </p><p>ARTICLE 0N TUNISIA.  ABDALLAH INDICATED THAT HE WAS </p><p>ALSO IN TOUCH WITH OTHER U.S. PUBLICATIONS CONCERNING </p><p>POSSIBLE PIECES ON TUNISIA.  IN REMINISCING ABOUT A </p><p>LUNCH WITH KATHRYN GRAHAM AND JIM HOAGLAND OF THE </p><p>WASHINGTON POST SHORTLY AFTER BEN ALI ASSUMED POWER, </p><p>HE MENTIONED POSSIBLY CONTACTING HOAGLAND AB0UT A </p><p>FEATURE STORY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>BURNISHING TUNISIA\'S IMAGE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR </p><p>THE GOT TO BE OPEN TO COVERAGE OF THE VISIT BY ALL </p><p>MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES, NOT JUST A SELECT FEW.  SHE </p><p>WENT ON TO ASK ABOUT THE GOT\'S PRINCIPAL THEMES FOR </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL VISIT.  ABDALLAH RESPONDED THAT BEN </p><p>ALI HOPED T0 USE THE VISIT TO PROMOTE TUNISIA\'S IMAGE </p><p>AMONG THE U.S. PUBLIC AS A TOLERANT, OPEN ISLAMIC </p><p>COUNTRY, COMMITTED TO MODERNIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>ABDALLAH SAID THE VISIT WOULD HOPEFULLY HIGHLIGHT </p><p>TUNISIA\'S TRAILBLAZING ROLE IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD IN </p><p>TERMS OF ADVANCING THE STATUS OF WOMEN.  IN THE </p><p>F0REIGN POLICY REALM, ACC0RDING T0 ABDALLAH, BEN ALI\'S </p><p>U.S. SOJOURN WOULD HELP TO UNDERSCORE TUNISIA\'S ROLE </p><p>AS A MODERATE, CONSTRUCTIVE ACTOR IN THE REGION ON </p><p>SUCH KEY ISSUES AS THE MEPP. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AMBASSAD0R P0INTED OUT THAT, WHILE TUNISIA\'S </p><p>PAST EFFORTS IN SUPPORT OF MEPP WERE PRAISEWORTHY, BEN </p><p>ALI COULD EXPECT TO BE ASKED ABOUT UNRESOLVED </p><p>ISSUES--FOR EXAMPLE, WHY THE GOT CONTINUED TO DELAY </p><p>ISSUANCE OF A VISA TO THE DESIGNATED NEW HEAD OF THE </p><p>ISRAELI INTERESTS SECTION HERE.  ABDALLAH ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THIS WAS A "COMPLICATED" QUESTI0N WHICH BEN ALI </p><p>AND HIS TEAM W0ULD NEED TO BE READY TO ANSWER BEFORE </p><p>U.S. AUDIENCES.  IN FAMILIAR GOT TERMS, HE CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THE GOT WAS CONSTRAINED IN ITS EFFORTS T0 PROMOTE </p><p>ITS ISRAELI RELATI0NSHIP BECAUSE 0F UNFAVORABLE PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION HERE AND IN THE ARAB WORLD GENERALLY.  HE </p><p>C0MPLAINED THAT, AS IT WAS, SOME IN THE ARAB WORLD </p><p>BRANDED TUNISIA AS AN "UN-ISLAMIC" COUNTRY BECAUSE OF </p><p>ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL AND ITS PROGRESSIVE </p><p>SOCIAL POLICIES (E.G., OUTLAWING OF POLYGAMY). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>DIVISIVE REGIONAL ISSUES--MEPP AND IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ELABORATING, ABDALLAH STATED THAT, WHILE </p><p>TUNISIANS BY AND LARGE SUPPORTED THE GOT\'S ENLIGHTENED </p><p>S0CIAL POLICIES, THEY WERE DIVIDED OVER SUCH KEY </p><p>REGIONAL ISSUES AS THE PEACE PROCESS AND IRAQ.  HE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT SOME STAUNCHLY PRO-IRAQI LOCAL J0URNALS </p><p>HAD BEC0ME LESS SUPPORTIVE OF IRAQ </p><p>LATELY--DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE TYRANNICAL SADDAM </p><p>AND THE SUFFERING IRAQI PEOPLE--BUT NONETHELESS </p><p>REMAINED STRONGLY ANTI-U.S. POLICY IN OUTLO0K, </p><p>REFLECTING THE VIEWS OF MANY TUNISIANS.  ABDALLAH WENT </p><p>ON TO ASSERT THAT WERE IT NOT FOR THE SELF-CENSORSHIP </p><p>PRACTICED BY MANY JOURNALISTS, IN ORDER TO "AV0ID </p><p>OFFENDING PRESIDENT BEN ALI" BY ATTACKING A FRIENDLY </p><p>COUNTRY, THEY WOULD BE MUCH HARSHER IN THEIR CRITICISM </p><p>OF U.S. MIDEAST POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>U.S. VERSUS TUNISIAN PRESS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT CRITICISM BY A </p><p>FREE PRESS WAS INEVITABLE, NOTING THE OFTEN-SEVERE </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE USG FOUND IN OUR OWN PRESS.  ABDALLAH </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THE U.S. PRESS, BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAW </p><p>AS ITS UNIQUE HISTORICAL ORIGINS, COULD NOT BE </p><p>COMPARED WITH THAT IN TUNISIA OR ELSEWHERE.  HE </p><p>OBSERVED THAT, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING DATING BACK TO </p><p>COLONIAL TIMES, THE U.S. PRESS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY </p><p>ORDINARY CITIZENS INTENT ON USING THEIR NEWSPAPERS AS </p><p>VEHICLES FOR FREE AND OPEN EXPRESSION OF VIEWS.  BY </p><p>CONTRAST, HE ASSERTED, IN OTHER COUNTRIES RULING </p><p>ELITES HAD "IMPOSED FROM ABOVE" A PRESS THAT HAS </p><p>CIRCUMSCRIBED IN ITS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.  MOREOVER, </p><p>HE ADDED, THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESS IN MANY </p><p>COUNTRIES HAS NOT SO MUCH TO INFORM THE PUBLIC, AS TO </p><p>EARN A PROFIT AS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE--AGAIN IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO THE U.S. EXPERIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>SUPPORT FOR FREER MEDIA </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ABDALLAH REPEATEDLY ASSERTED THAT THE GOT </p><p>LEADERSHIP ENCOURAGED THE MEDIA TO BE MORE OPEN, BUT, </p><p>HE INDICATED, SELF-CENSORSHIP REMAINED WIDESPREAD OUT </p><p>OF JOURNALISTS\' CONCERN NOT TO ANTAGONIZE THAT </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  ABDALLAH DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME </p><p>UNNAMED GOT OFFICIALS, WHILE PAYING LIP SERVICE TO THE </p><p>NEED FOR EXPANDED MEDIA FREEDOMS, NONETHELESS </p><p>PROTESTED STRENUOUSLY WHEN THEY THEMSELVES WERE </p><p>AFFECTED BY NEGATIVE TELEVISION OR PRESS COVERAGE. </p><p>(COMMENT:  ABDALLAH DOUBTLESS WAS REFERRING TO </p><p>NEGATIVE REPORTING ABOUT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, NOT </p><p>SPECIFIC OFFICIALS, AS MEDIA CRITICISM OF OFFICIALS BY </p><p>NAME OR POSITION IS NON-EXISTENT.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>ACCORDING TO ABDALLAH, PRESIDENT BEN ALI HIMSELF WANTS </p><p>TO SEE MORE OPENNESS IN THE MEDIA AND FORBIDS MEMBERS </p><p>OF HIS IMMEDIATE STAFF FROM CONTACTING JOURNALS TO </p><p>PROTEST OFFENDING ARTICLES.  ABDALLAH GAVE ASSURANCES </p><p>THAT THE GOT PRESIDENCY WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR </p><p>FREER TUNISIAN MEDIA IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION BY SOME </p><p>IN THE GOVERNMENT.  HE STRESSED WHAT HE SAW AS THE </p><p>CRUCIAL ROLE PLAYED BY OPPOSITION PARTY JOURNALS IN </p><p>PROMOTING A FREE PRESS, SAYING THE GOT LEADERSHIP </p><p>ENCOURAGED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH JOURNALS, WITH WHAT </p><p>HE DESCRIBED AS THEIR MORE OPEN REPORTING, IN AN </p><p>EFFORT TO WHITTLE DOWN THE PRACTICE OF SELF-CENSORSHIP </p><p>BY THE MEDIA GENERALLY. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) AMBASSAD0R SAID THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR BEN </p><p>ALI TO DISCUSS FRANKLY AND OPENLY TUNISIA\'S HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS SITUATION DURING HIS U.S. VISIT.  ABDALLAH TOOK </p><p>THIS ON BOARD AND REMARKED THAT FOREIGN NGO\'S AND </p><p>OTHERS HAD VOICED "MANY EXAGGERATIONS" IN CRITICIZING </p><p>THE GOT\'S RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS.  HE CITED </p><p>ALLEGATIONS ABOUT POLITICAL PRISONERS HERE AS A CASE </p><p>IN POINT, MAINTAINING THAT THEY WERE NOT BEING HELD </p><p>SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR VIEWS, BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE </p><p>TYPICALLY ISLAMIST EXTREMISTS CONVICTED BY THE COURTS </p><p>0F COMMITING ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR BEING INVOLVED IN </p><p>PLOTTING SUCH ACTS.  AMBASSADOR RESP0NDED THAT, WHILE </p><p>RESORTING TO, OR ESPOUSING VIOLENCE AS A P0LITICAL </p><p>TOOL WAS UNACCEPTABLE IN ANY SOCIETY, THE FREEDOM TO </p><p>CRITICIZE AND EXPRESS DISSENTING VIEWS, WHETHER BY </p><p>ISLAMISTS OR OTHERS, NEEDED T0 BE RESPECTED.  ABDALLAH </p><p>REJOINED THAT, FOR THE GOT, THERE WERE NO "MODERATE </p><p>ISLAMISTS" WILLING TO ACCEPT DEMOCRATIC N0RMS; </p><p>INSTEAD, THE GOT\'S EXPERIENCE WAS THAT ISLAMISTS, EVEN </p><p>IF PROFESSING SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY, ACTUALLY REJECTED </p><p>IT AND SOUGHT TO IMPOSE AN AUTHORITARIAN ISLAMIC </p><p>STATE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) AMBASSAD0R POINTED OUT THAT FREEDOM OF </p><p>EXPRESSION AND DEBATE WAS KEY TO ANY EFFORT TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIZE A POLITICAL SYSTEM, DESPITE INEVITABLE </p><p>ABUSES 0F THESE FREEDOMS BY S0ME.  ABDALLAH REITERATED </p><p>THE GOT\'S COMMITMENT T0 DEMOCRATIZATION, CITING BEN </p><p>ALI\'S INITIATIVES, NOW ENSHRINED IN LEGISLATI0N, TO </p><p>ENSURE MULTIPLE CANDIDATES IN THE 1999 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS AS WELL AS A MINIMUM OF 20 PERCENT OF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SEATS FOR OPPOSITION CANDIDATES IN THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS.  ABDALLAH ADDED THAT THE </p><p>GOT\'S COMMITMENT TO UNDERTAKE DEMOCRATIC REFORMS UNDER </p><p>ITS ASSOCIATI0N AGREEMENT WITH THE EUR0PEAN UNION </p><p>REFLECTED ITS "STRATEGIC CHOICE" IN FAVOR OF OPEN </p><p>POLITICAL, AS WELL AS ECONOMIC, SYSTEMS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>THE KSILA CASE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) AMBASSADOR RAISED THE CASE OF TUNISIAN HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS LEAGUE VICE PRESIDENT KHEMAIS KSILA, IMPRISONED </p><p>SINCE FEBRUARY 1998 FOLLOWING ARREST AND CONVICTION IN </p><p>COURT FOR CIRCULATING AN ANTI-GOT COMMUNIQUE.  NOTING </p><p>THE QUESTIONABLE GROUNDS FOR KSILA\'S PROSECUTION, </p><p>AMBASSADOR URGED THAT THE GOT LOOK FOR WAYS TO RELEASE </p><p>THE ACTIVIST, POINTING OUT THAT DOING SO PRIOR TO BEN </p><p>ALI\'S WASHINGTON VISIT WOULD BE ESPECIALLY NOTICED BY </p><p>U.S. AUDIENCES.  ABDALLAH RESPONDED, ALONG STANDARD </p><p>GOT LINES, THAT KSILA HAD BEEN PROSECUTED AND </p><p>CONVICTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH TUNISIAN LAW.  (COMMENT: </p><p>IN FACT, THERE WERE SEVERAL IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING </p><p>THE GOT SWITCHING JUDGES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRIAL.) </p><p>NONETHELESS, HE INDICATED THAT THE GOT WOULD BE </p><p>PREPARED TO CONSIDER GRANTING HIM EARLY RELEASE UNDER </p><p>A CLEMENCY ARRANGEMENT SIMILAR TO THAT EXTENDED TO </p><p>OTHER PRISONERS.  THE RUB, ACCORDING TO ABDALLAH, WAS </p><p>THAT SO FAR KSILA HAD REFUSED TO SUBMIT THE STANDARD </p><p>LETTER TO HEN ALI, REQUESTING CLEMENCY, REQUIRED OF </p><p>ALL PRISONERS SEEKING EARLY RELEASE.  ABDALLAH CLAIMED </p><p>THAT WHILE KSILA\'S WIFE HAD URGED HIM TO SUBMIT THE </p><p>LETTER, HE STUBBORNLY REFUSED.  WHEN AMBASSADOR ASKED </p><p>WHY, ABDALLAH RESPONDED THAT KSILA HAD AN OBSTINATE </p><p>CHARACTER AND PERHAPS WISHED TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS A </p><p>MARTYR.  IN RESPONSE T0 AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY, ABDALLAH </p><p>FLATLY DISMISSED KISILA AS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE </p><p>BEN ALI GOVERNMENT, SAYING KSILA HAD NO SIGNIFICANT </p><p>FOLLOWING IN POLITICAL CIRCLES. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) ABDALLAH, WIDELY VIEWED AS A KEY MEMBER OF </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S INNER CIRCLE, HAS SERVED IN HIS </p><p>CURRENT POSITION SINCE DECEMBER 1990.  LIKE OTHER </p><p>SENIOR ADVISERS TO BEN ALI, ABDALLAH MAINTAINS A LOW </p><p>PUBLIC PROFILE; DESPITE THE TITLE OF PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>SPOKESMAN, HE RARELY MAKES PUBLIC PRON0UNCEMENTS. </p><p>ABDALLAH IS REGARDED BY SOME TUNISIAN AND DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CONTACTS AS A SHADOWY FIGURE, ORCHESTRATING SECRETIVE, </p><p>AUTHORITARIAN TENDENCIES WITH THE HEN ALI GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE PROJECTED A FAR DIFFERENT IMAGE IN HIS </p><p>CONVERSATI0N WITH THE AMBASSADOR, COMING ACROSS AS </p><p>SM0OTH, SELF-CONFIDENT, AND ENGAGING INTERLOCUT0R.  HE </p><p>SEEMED WELL-DISP0SED T0WARD THE U.S., RECALLING WARMLY </p><p>HIS DEALINGS OVER THE YEARS WITH A SUCCESSION OF U.S. </p><p>AMBASSAD0RS, JOURNALISTS, AND 0THERS.  ABDALLAH </p><p>APPEARED TO BE WELL-INFORMED ABOUT THE U.S. MEDIA </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT; HE SPOKE FONDLY OF A 1987 MEETING HERE, </p><p>AS INFORMATI0N MINISTER, WITH THE WASHINGTON POST\'S </p><p>KATHRYN GRAHAM.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE </p><p>ABILITY OF ABDALLAH AND HEN ALI TO IMPLEMENT A SERIOUS </p><p>COMMITMENT TO A MORE OPEN MEDIA, ASSUMING THEY HAVE </p><p>SUCH A COMMITMENT; VARIOUS CONTACTS HAVE ALLEGED THAT </p><p>IT IS ABDALLAH HIMSELF, NOT OTHER UNNAMED OFFICIALS HE </p><p>CITED, WHO IS RESISTANT TO A FREER TUNISIAN MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) ABDALLAH\'S PREDICTABLY EXAGGERATED PORTRAYAL </p><p>OF BEN ALI AS ENERGETIC, REFORM-MINDED LEADER 0F A </p><p>MODERNIZING, TOLERANT ISLAMIC COUNTRY SERVED AS A </p><p>FORETASTE OF THE GOT\'S MEDIA CAMPAIGN SURROUNDING THE </p><p>UPCOMING WASHINGT0N VISIT.  ABDALLAH SEEMS TO REALIZE, </p><p>THOUGH, THAT PROMOTING THIS PRESIDENTIAL IMAGE WILL </p><p>REQUIRE BEN ALI TO BE ARTICULATE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD </p><p>IN ADDRESSING THE TOUGHER ISSUES BEF0RE U.S. </p><p>AUDIENCES--SUCH AS THE G0T\'S LESS-THAN-PERFECT HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS RECORD AND THE GOT\'S FAILURE OF LATE TO BE AS </p><p>SUPPORTIVE AS IN THE PAST OF U.S. EFFORTS ON THE </p><p>MEPP.  END C0MMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) BIO DETAILS:  ABDALLAH, BORN IN 1940, WAS </p><p>EDUCATED AS A LAWYER IN FRANCE.  HE IS A VETERAN </p><p>JOURNALIST AND ACTIVIST IN THE RULING PARTY.  PRIOR TO </p><p>HIS CURRENT POSITION, HE SERVED AS AMBASSAD0R TO </p><p>BRITAIN (1988-90) AND INFORMATI0N MINISTER (1987-88). </p><p>AMONG HIS EARLIER POSITIONS:  DIRECTOR OF TUNISIA\'S </p><p>NATI0NAL PRESS SERVICE (1986-87), PUBLISHER OF </p><p>FRENCH-LANGUAGE DAILY "LA PRESSE DE TUNISIE" </p><p>(1979-86), AND CHIEF OF STAFF TO INFORMATION MINISTER </p><p>(1978-79) AND TO CULTURE MINISTER (1976-78).  ALTHOUGH </p><p>HE APPEARS TO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, HE C0NVERSED WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR IN FRENCH; HE ALSO SPEAKS ARABIC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RAPHEL </p><p></p></div>
