<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001667 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, March 19, </p><p>highlights under banner headlines reported remarks by </p><p>the White House spokesperson that "Washington will </p><p>enter Iraq even if Saddam leaves".  Major stories </p><p>focus on developments related to the war on Iraq, </p><p>including the Iraqi President\'s rejection of the U.S. </p><p>ultimatum. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "War against the United Nations" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Rakan Majali writes on the back page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/19):  "Some analysts make the point that the major </p><p>effect of the war will be to put an end to the old </p><p>world order that has prevailed since the second world </p><p>war and that brought forth the United Nations and also </p><p>achieved a status of international equalization </p><p>particularly between the two superpowers, the United </p><p>States and the Soviet Union..  The U.S. invasion of </p><p>Iraq will, in effect, mean the end of the United </p><p>Nations, because, according to the United States, the </p><p>organization has exhausted its purposes and the world </p><p>order that existed since the second world war needs to </p><p>be replaced by a new world order, which has previously </p><p>been declared by the United States following the </p><p>collapse of the Soviet Union.  What the United States </p><p>seeks to do today is to move from the declaration </p><p>phase to the implementation phase of this new world </p><p>order, thereby reflecting a specific status quo, </p><p>namely the presence of a single superpower that </p><p>controls the world\'s capabilities." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A quiet discussion about the option of stepping </p><p>down" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/19):  "The American-British camp is ready to </p><p>launch war and there are no positive indications of </p><p>any move towards finding a solution that protects the </p><p>Iraqi people from the American aggression any other </p><p>movement.  Bush\'s ultimatum to the Iraqi President and </p><p>his family to leave or face war is nothing but a </p><p>political maneuver to attempt to put the ball in the </p><p>Iraqi court and hold the Iraqi President responsible </p><p>for starting the war..  The Iraqi President will not </p><p>leave and there is nothing in his history or his </p><p>mentality that would suggest that.  Moreover, most </p><p>countries reject this idea because it opens the door </p><p>to chaos in international relations.  Washington would </p><p>start building up its forces around every country </p><p>whose policies it does not approve of and then require </p><p>changing the regime by the threat of power.  This </p><p>would be utter nonsense." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The imminent Iraqi attack" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/19):  "The world has not witnessed such a blatant </p><p>aggression since the days of the Moguls.  In the name </p><p>of eliminating alleged weapons of mass destruction, </p><p>America is going to use weapons of mass destruction; </p><p>and on the pretext of implementing Security Council </p><p>resolutions, America bypasses the Security Council, </p><p>which does not want war.  And on the pretext of </p><p>protecting Iraq\'s neighbors, America threatens those </p><p>same neighbors if they fail to provide facilities for </p><p>the aggression; and under the pretext of saving the </p><p>Iraqi people, three thousand bombs will fall on Iraqi </p><p>cities in the first few hours of the war.  The </p><p>president of the most democratic country in the world </p><p>allowed himself to deliver a fiery speech asking the </p><p>president of another sovereign country to abandon his </p><p>country within 48 hours.  How can this happen in the </p><p>twenty-first century?  Why has America become a </p><p>country that undermines international law, ignores </p><p>world public opinion, and wages a destructive war </p><p>without provocation?  U.S. President Bush\'s address </p><p>will go down in history along with speeches by Hitler, </p><p>Stalin and all other dictators who love war and </p><p>understand nothing but the language of force, threats, </p><p>invasions and destruction." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The war is not the end" </p><p>Daily columnist Tarek Masarweh writes on the back page </p><p>of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/19):  "In his address, President Bush asked the </p><p>Iraqi President to leave his country within 48 hours </p><p>in order to avoid war and is asking the Iraqi army not </p><p>to fight.  The American President is asking the Iraqis </p><p>to open up their cities and villages to the American </p><p>occupation army.  Is there any worse contempt, not </p><p>only for the Iraqis, but also for the people of the </p><p>world?  To think that a people might welcome an </p><p>occupation may apply in a different country, but it </p><p>cannot happen in a country that fought for eight </p><p>years, suffered a siege for twelve years and resisted </p><p>all forms of American operations..  The declaration of </p><p>war is not the end to the Iraqi issue.  It is just the </p><p>beginning." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
