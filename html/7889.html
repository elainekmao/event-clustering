DepSecDef is quoted as saying on Tuesday that </p><p>Turkey should admit it had made a mistake when it refused to </p><p>allow U.S. soldiers to operate from Turkey in the Iraq </p><p>campaign,.  Turkey\'s military wasn\'t powerful enough to sway </p><p>politicians, Wolfowitz noted.  `Turkey has attempted to make </p><p>deals with one of the worst dictators the world had seen. </p><p>Turkey should admit its mistake.  We believe that Iran and </p><p>Syria must their change attitude, and Turkish relations with </p><p>them should be parallel to U.S. policy,\' he stressed. Papers </p><p>state Wolfowitz complained that the Turkish government and </p><p>public have not grasped the Iraqi reality.  He also said </p><p>that Turkey would not be given an immediate role in </p><p>peacekeeping activities in Iraq, as that the Iraqi people </p><p>were not positive about their neighbors, including Turkey. </p><p>He is further quoted as saying,`We were told to leave </p><p>Incirlik Air Base.  We will not stay anywhere we\'re not </p><p>wanted.  We don\'t think Incirlik will maintain its </p><p>significance in the future,\' Wolfowitz added.  He also made </p><p>it clear that U.S. would not allow unilateral military </p><p>action in Northern Iraq, and warned that Turkish troops </p><p>should act in coordination with the coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hurriyet" opined that Wolfowitz has openly said things thus </p><p>far uttered only behind closed doors in the Pentagon. </p><p>"Sabah" finds the remarks from the `brain of U.S. policy- </p><p>making mechanism\' as strange.  "Milliyet" regards the </p><p>comments as a `threat\' to Turkey when Wolfowitz urged Ankara </p><p>to change its attitude about Iraq if it wanted to repair the </p><p>strain in ties with the U.S.. "Aksam" says that Turkey\'s </p><p>"new neighbor" (the USA with its army in northern Iraq) has </p><p>issued strong messages, and proposed that Ankara\'s Iran and </p><p>Syria policies should be in line with the U.S. conduct." </p><p>"Turkiye" believes that U.S. is still `angry\' with Turkey. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" believes that despite the strong criticism, </p><p>Wolfowitz also offered a formula to sort out problems in </p><p>bilateral relations.  Commentaries say Wolfowitz has </p><p>disclosed the deepening rift between the two countries. Op- </p><p>eds in mainstream papers agree that without zigzags, the </p><p>U.S. has openly indicated that Turkey\'s significance as a </p><p>strategic partner would decline if Ankara does not change </p><p>its attitude, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul said Wolfowitz has issued positive </p><p>messages for the betterment of ties between the two </p><p>countries, adding that the Wolfowitz comments were `honest, </p><p>pragmatic and future-bound.\'  Deputy Chief of Staff, General </p><p>Buyukanit reportedly said that such remarks were indicative </p><p>of Wolfowitz\'s style.  Opposition party CHP\'s leader Baykal </p><p>said on Wednesday that Wolfowitz\'s words reflected a </p><p>`personal disappointment,\' and criticized Wolfowitz, `the </p><p>representative of a country aspiring to bring democracy to </p><p>the Middle East,\' for blaming the military\'s </p><p>`ineffectiveness\' vis--vis politicians.  `The matter has </p><p>two sides,\' said Justice Minister Cicek on Wednesday. </p><p>`Turkey, in the last 50 years, has always responded </p><p>positively to U.S. demands.  Wolfowitz must remember that </p><p>U.S. has not always kept its promises to Turkey, as lately </p><p>seen in the First Gulf War,\' Cicek told the press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MOD is denied appointment in U.S.: Dailies report that </p><p>Minister of Defense, Vecdi Gonul, who arrived in Washington </p><p>on Saturday for NATO defense ministers\' meeting, was denied </p><p>appointment by senior U.S. officials except for U/S of State </p><p>Grossman.  Papers remind readers that Gonul, who was in the </p><p>U.S. together with Turkey\'s foreign and economy ministers </p><p>before the March vote, had held meetings with high level </p><p>officials, and was received by President Bush at the White </p><p>House as well.  Papers agree this to be another indication </p><p>of deteriorating U.S., Turkey ties. (In fact, Gunul had a </p><p>tight schedule, and had not asked for DOD appointments). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq\'s rebuilding: MFA\'s Iraq rebuilding coordinator, </p><p>Ambassador Gunduz Okcun said that contrary to general </p><p>belief, Iraq\'s reconstruction would not offer a business </p><p>volume of $150-200 billion, papers say.  Iraq will have to </p><p>pay, in war reparation and other fees, $500 billion to </p><p>Kuwait, Iran and some international institutions, Okcun </p><p>noted.  Having significant experience in the region, Turkey </p><p>is the best candidate for partnership and subcontract work </p><p>in Iraq, Okcun stressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Earthquake: "Milliyet" reports that 14 boarding schools in </p><p>various Turkish provinces are built close to fault lines, </p><p>endangering lives of thousands of primary school children. </p><p>President Sezer and TGS Chief General Ozkok have paid a </p><p>visit to the earthquake-stricken area in Bingol, papers </p><p>report.  Sezer called for the punishment of those who </p><p>constructed the sub-standard buildings where 167 people lost </p><p>their lives during last week\'s earthquake. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Wolfowitz remarks about Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"US has settled the accounts with Turkey" </p><p>Ismet Berkan commented on the Wolfowitz remarks in liberal- </p><p>intellectual Radikal (5/7): "Wolfowitz stated in a very </p><p>clear tone that Turkey has to accept its mistake on the Iraq </p><p>issue in order to improve US-Turkey relations.  This </p><p>statement in fact suggests to Turkey a condition to </p><p>normalize the bilateral ties, which Turkey would never </p><p>accept.  My conclusion from the Wolfowitz remarks is that </p><p>the US will remain distant toward Turkey as long as the </p><p>basis of the March 2 atmosphere [the date of parliament\'s </p><p>decline of motion] continues to exist.  It seems nothing </p><p>will ever be the same again as far as Turkey-US relations </p><p>are concerned, because `the vase\' is broken and cannot be </p><p>repaired any more.  The only way out is to be able to find a </p><p>`new vase\' and replace the older one." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Turkey-US Fault Line" </p><p>Erdal Safak editorialized in mass appeal Sabah (5/7): "The </p><p>remarks by Wolfowitz very clearly indicate the huge gap in </p><p>Turkish-American bilateral ties.  The Iraq war has turned </p><p>into a litmus test between the US and its relations with the </p><p>others.  Some passed the test, some -including </p><p>Turkey-failed.  . Now it is the time to settle the accounts </p><p>and the US is preparing the bill for the losers of this </p><p>game.  Among them, the UN, France and Germany have started </p><p>receiving `the bill\' already.  The UN is out of the Iraqi </p><p>rebuilding program.  France is facing punishment by not </p><p>getting any share in the Iraqi reconstruction projects. . As </p><p>for Turkey, we can see what type of bill we will have to </p><p>pay.  As Wolfowitz openly stated, Turkey\'s bill is related </p><p>to northern Iraq.  Turkey will no longer have a say in this </p><p>area and related developments. . Wolfowitz on the other hand </p><p>is not closing the door and is showing the way out to </p><p>normalize the ties again.  Yet it remains to be seen if </p><p>Ankara -both its military, parliament and the </p><p>government-will be able to admit the mistakes that it made." </p><p>"AKP is like a thorn in the eye for the US" </p><p>Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal (5/7): </p><p>"Wolfowitz claims that the army is the real decision </p><p>mechanism in Turkey.  He does not conceal the serious </p><p>disappointment in Washington toward the AKP government and </p><p>questions the reasons for army\'s reluctance to stand against </p><p>the AKP approach during the Iraq crisis. At this point, it </p><p>seems that the AKP looks like a thorn in Washington\'s eye." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pentagon speaks its mind in the end" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in mass appeal-sensational Posta </p><p>(5/7): "Frankly, though I had expected some reaction, I had </p><p>not expected it be so bold.  The fact that these bitter </p><p>words come from the Pentagon, the establishment that had </p><p>always protected Turkey and spoken in its favor, indicates </p><p>the gravity of the situation.  It also indicates the depth </p><p>of the problem.  It is extremely important that Wolfowitz </p><p>uttered these words-which were of a kind heard in Ankara for </p><p>the first time.  Wolfowitz chose his words with utmost care. </p><p>However, reading between the lines I get the following </p><p>message: Northern Iraq is no longer Turkey\'s back garden. </p><p>You cannot get into it and exit from it according to your </p><p>wishes.  You cannot act freely there.  You have to notify us </p><p>of your activities, obtain permission from us.  And, in the </p><p>long run, it would be hard for you to remain in Northern </p><p>Iraq-even if we managed to rebuild our relations to their </p><p>former level.  Stop being preoccupied with the Kurds.  What </p><p>surprised me most was Wolfowitz\' remarks about the Turkish </p><p>Armed Forces.  Pentagon used to see the Turkish military as </p><p>its best ally and never criticized them.  This rule too has </p><p>now been broken.  Wolfowitz stressed, for the first time and </p><p>with special emphasis, that they were bitterly disappointed </p><p>by way the Turkish General Staff kept quiet when an issue </p><p>vitally important for Turkey-that is, the U.S. troop </p><p>deployment in Turkey motion-was about to be put to a vote in </p><p>Parliament.  When certain Pentagon officials called Ankara </p><p>and received the following answer: `Sorry, we are not the </p><p>proper interlocutor.  Call the government,\' and the American </p><p>military reportedly went crazy.  Wolfowitz made it all too </p><p>clear that Turkey gives the impression that it is very close </p><p>to Syria and Iran.  I read his message in the following </p><p>manner: If you are going to Syria and Iran in the framework </p><p>of our policy and in order to relay our views, then there </p><p>will be no problem.  If not, your stance will create the </p><p>impression that you are against us." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
