<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000123 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AA/AFR AFR/WA EGAT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, EINV, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN STOCK EXCHANGE SEEKS USAID PARTNERSHIP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  02 Lagos 01933 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.    (U) SUMMARY:  The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)  seeks </p><p>USAID  assistance to expand its services.  The NSE plans  to </p><p>attract more Nigerians and foreign investors to the equities </p><p>market  through  greater accessibility  and  new  investment </p><p>vehicles in derivative markets.  The NSE raised the issue of </p><p>working  in partnership with USAID and in particular  sought </p><p>assistance in the areas of hardware and software acquisition </p><p>and  provision of technical assistance and training.   USAID </p><p>is  in the process of developing a new five-year strategy to </p><p>begin  in  January 2004, and will seek to identify  ways  of </p><p>working  in partnership with NSE in the context of  the  new </p><p>strategy.  USAID and NSE will develop terms of reference  to </p><p>conduct  an  assessment in early 2003 to  identify  specific </p><p>areas  of partnership.  In addition, USTDA is considering  a </p><p>2003 technical assistance grant to the NSE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.    (U)  On  October 21, 2002, Econoff attended a  meeting </p><p>between  USAID  Mission Director Dawn  Liberi  and  Nicholas </p><p>Okoye  of  the Nigerian Stock Exchange.  Okoye is  Technical </p><p>Adviser to the Director General and CEO of the NSE,  and  is </p><p>Head  of  the newly created Strategy and Derivatives Markets </p><p>department.   Okoye  presented a  proposal  for  partnership </p><p>opportunities  between  the  NSE  and  USAID,  as  the   NSE </p><p>continues  to  improve its IT infrastructure  and  plans  to </p><p>expand investor services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.    (U)  Okoye reported that the NSE has achieved  several </p><p>important  international benchmarks  for  equities  markets, </p><p>including   clearing  transactions  in   three   days   (T+3 </p><p>clearance)  and  the  development of  a  transparent  review </p><p>system  whereby reports of companies traded on the  exchange </p><p>are  available  via  the NSE Website.   In  addition,  Okoye </p><p>reiterated the NSE\'s ranking by Standard and Poors  and  the </p><p>International  Financial  Corporation  (IFC)  as  third  for </p><p>return  on  investment among exchanges worldwide  and  first </p><p>among  emerging  markets. (REFTEL).  The NSE  now  plans  to </p><p>attract  more investors by creating new investment  vehicles </p><p>targeted  toward  individuals in Nigeria, institutions  both </p><p>domestic  and  foreign,  and  Nigerians  living  or  working </p><p>abroad.   Okoye  and  the  NSE  Director  General  met  with </p><p>representatives  of the New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE)  and </p><p>the American Stock Exchange (ASE) in May to discuss ways  in </p><p>which the NSE can leverage the expertise and global reach of </p><p>the  US  exchanges through technical assistance and training </p><p>programs.   The  NSE  also  hopes  the  US  exchanges   will </p><p>introduce  the  NSE to key international fund  managers  who </p><p>focus on emerging markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR NIGERIANS AT HOME:  INVESTMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.    (U)  Okoye  noted  that less  than  three  percent  of </p><p>Nigerians are invested in the NSE in any capacity,  compared </p><p>to  75 percent of Americans and 63 percent of European Union </p><p>citizens  who invest in equity markets directly  or  through </p><p>mutual   funds  and  retirement  plans.   To  attract   more </p><p>individual  investors in Nigeria and leverage the  economies </p><p>of  scales of the current nationwide banking system, the NSE </p><p>plans to partner with banks to develop a new savings entity, </p><p>the  individual  investment account.  Since  Nigerian  banks </p><p>tend  to  have  branches  in  even  small  towns  throughout </p><p>Nigeria, the NSE sees a partnership with banks to be a  more </p><p>efficient way to reach individual investors than encouraging </p><p>stockbrokers to expand their capacity and reach.  Individual </p><p>investment  accounts  would allow bank depositors  to  place </p><p>savings  into  an account that would purchase shares  of  an </p><p>equities   portfolio,   allowing   greater   returns    than </p><p>traditional savings accounts.  According to Okoye, the  1999 </p><p>Universal  Banking Act permits licensed banks to participate </p><p>in every aspect of the financial industry, allowing for this </p><p>sort of partnership between banks and the exchange. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.    (U)  To further encourage individual investors to  use </p><p>the  stock  exchange  and  to enhance  the  reliability  and </p><p>credibility of transactions, the NSE is developing an  email </p><p>system  to  notify investors of transactions made  on  their </p><p>behalf.   According  to Okoye, in the  US  an  automatically </p><p>generated confirmation letter notifies each investor when  a </p><p>broker  places a trade on his or her behalf.   The  Nigerian </p><p>postal  system  is  considered too  unreliable  for  such  a </p><p>system,   and  thus,  trades  are  currently  made   without </p><p>confirmation, known as "selling without a mandate."  The NSE </p><p>is considering the creation of a free email account for each </p><p>investor  in  the  exchange through which  confirmations  of </p><p>trades  may be posted.  Okoye notes that while few Nigerians </p><p>have  access to computers and the Internet at home or  work, </p><p>many  individuals  maintain free accounts that  they  access </p><p>from  cyber  cafes,  which are quite common  throughout  the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND NIGERIANS LIVING ABROAD: NEW </p><p>INVESTMENT VEHICLES IN THE DERIVATIVES MARKETS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.    (U)  Okoye  estimates that Nigerians  living  overseas </p><p>return over three billion dollars annually to Nigeria, often </p><p>in  the  form  of  real  estate purchases  and  investments. </p><p>However,  Okoye states that these individuals are frequently </p><p>victims   of   unscrupulous   transactions   or   unreliable </p><p>construction  cost  estimates.  The NSE  believes  Nigerians </p><p>abroad,  as  well as institutional investors in-country  and </p><p>abroad,   are   looking   for   credible   and   transparent </p><p>opportunities to invest in Nigeria.  As head  of  the  NSE\'s </p><p>new   derivatives  markets  department,  Okoye   highlighted </p><p>several  investment  products currently  under  development. </p><p>(REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.    (U)  Okoye states his team is developing  an  Exchange </p><p>Traded  Fund (ETF).  Like the NASDAQ "QQQ," or the  American </p><p>Stock Exchange "SPDR," the ETF will consist of a "basket" of </p><p>the  top 30 or so companies listed on the NSE which will  be </p><p>traded  as  a  single  security.   The  Johannesburg   Stock </p><p>Exchange   (JSE)  currently  has  a  fund  of  this   nature </p><p>available.   The  NSE  is also preparing  option  contracts, </p><p>which are not currently traded on the NSE.  Further, the NSE </p><p>is   exploring  whether  foreign  investors  will  be   more </p><p>comfortable  investing in NSE listed companies  through  the </p><p>NYSE and ASE in the form of depository receipts.  To attract </p><p>the  Nigerian expat investor, the NSE is developing  a  real </p><p>estate investment trust and note product, which will involve </p><p>the  issuance  of notes against real estate developments  or </p><p>securities  against ongoing rents.  Similarly,  the  NSE  is </p><p>developing oil and gas trust notes.  The NSE points out that </p><p>indigenous energy companies are now positioned to take  over </p><p>"marginal" or low-volume oil fields from major international </p><p>producers.   Most  of  these  are  capped-wells,   requiring </p><p>capital  investment in flow stations and piping,  which  can </p><p>cost  15  to 30 million dollars, according to Okoye.   Local </p><p>banks  generally do not provide sufficient lending for  such </p><p>projects, so the NSE believes it can offer investment trusts </p><p>of   sufficient  credibility  and  reliability  to   attract </p><p>investors  and generate the funding needed to  launch  these </p><p>ventures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AREAS FOR POSSIBLE USAID PARTNERSHIP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.    (U)  NSE requested USAID assistance with the provision </p><p>of  new  hardware and software needed to develop and  manage </p><p>each  of  the  investment vehicles,  as  well  as  technical </p><p>assistance  and  training in both  IT  systems  and  trading </p><p>aspects of these products.  Such IT systems development  and </p><p>new services training will be necessary both for the NSE and </p><p>a  set  of Nigerian financial institutions that will  become </p><p>custodial  banks to facilitate the derivatives transactions. </p><p>Okoye  states  that  the  NSE would primarily  use  US  made </p><p>products  and consultants for these ventures, including  the </p><p>NYSE and ASE.  He notes that the NSE Board of Directors  has </p><p>approved  the concept of the exchange acting as  a  regional </p><p>clearinghouse  for securities transactions  involving  other </p><p>African  countries.  Thomas Briggs of the US  Department  of </p><p>Treasury  suggested such a concept during a recent  tour  of </p><p>Nigeria.  Okoye states that the NSE is currently negotiating </p><p>with  a  company  in  Boston  to establish  and  maintain  a </p><p>database to record and call-up transactions for the last  12 </p><p>years,   a   necessity  if  NSE  is  to  become  a  regional </p><p>clearinghouse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.    (U)  USAID Mission Director indicated that  USAID  was </p><p>developing  a  new five-year strategy and that collaboration </p><p>with  NSE  could be explored within the context of  the  new </p><p>strategy.  USAID would consult further with NSE and  conduct </p><p>an assessment to identify potential areas of partnership and </p><p>collaboration.  She estimated that such an assessment  could </p><p>take  place in early 2003.  Additionally, the US  Trade  and </p><p>Development  Agency  is considering a  technical  assistance </p><p>grant  to the NSE to upgrade its computer system and develop </p><p>a secondary trading floor in case of catastrophic failure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
