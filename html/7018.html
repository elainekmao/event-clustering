O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOZ Ups Grain Subsidy </p><p> </p><p>Ref: a) Harare 152  b) Harare 489 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The GOZ has increased nearly 4-fold the </p><p>amount it pays growers for maize.  By leaving the crop\'s </p><p>low consumer price intact, however, the cash-starved GOZ </p><p>assumes a weighty subsidy.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The GOZ also announced an approximate doubling of </p><p>the producer price for wheat.  Through its Grain </p><p>Marketing Board (GMB), the GOZ plays a middleman role </p><p>between growers and millers/retailers.  At present </p><p>prices, the GOZ will subsidize 93 percent of the maize </p><p>cost and 81 percent of the wheat cost. </p><p> </p><p>Candid Assessment from Within GOZ </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) A high-level GOZ official told DCM he was </p><p>scheduled to go to State House and attempt to convince </p><p>the powers-that-be that it is also necessary to raise the </p><p>price of maize to consumers.  He said past arguments for </p><p>a price hike had been rebuffed on grounds that it would </p><p>drive the population toward the opposition.  The official </p><p>argued that shortages and corruption spawned by </p><p>artificially-low prices does the same, minus any </p><p>palliative effect.  He concludes that the point may be </p><p>moot anyway:  The new producer price is still far enough </p><p>below prevailing market prices that he doubts the GMB </p><p>will capture much of this year\'s harvest. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (U) As with fuel (ref a) and energy (ref b), the GOZ\'s </p><p>intervention in grain markets amid a free-falling economy </p><p>has created a no-win predicament.  At artificially low </p><p>prices, producers/suppliers have no incentive to sell </p><p>fuel, energy and food.  If prices rise to market </p><p>equilibrium, however, most Zimbabweans -- who now take </p><p>home less than US$ 20/month -- cannot afford food and </p><p>transport.  Through the new subsidy, the GOZ seeks to </p><p>avert shortages and mollify consumers (i.e., shift the </p><p>supply-curve outward to intersect with demand at lower </p><p>price levels).  But it has simply swapped one </p><p>macroeconomic distortion (low producer prices) for </p><p>another (an unaffordable subsidy), another futile stunt </p><p>to mask Zimbabwe\'s dizzying impoverishment. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
