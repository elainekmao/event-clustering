(SBU) Summary:  Nepal\'s Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman </p><p>Acharya will use his April 2-5 visit to Washington to urge </p><p>quick delivery of additional security and development aid </p><p>to Nepal, to discuss cooperation in the fight against </p><p>terrorism, and to press for more favorable trade terms for </p><p>Nepali products.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Terror and Aid </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SDU) Nepal\'s Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya </p><p>told Ambassador March 27 that he considered his April 2-5 </p><p>Washington visit to be a follow-up to the SecState visit </p><p>to Nepal in January.  The SecState visit boosted morale, </p><p>but had also raised expectations, Acharya said.  He would </p><p>use his meetings in Washington to underline the importance </p><p>of delivering additional aid - including military </p><p>assistance - to Nepal quicker, rather than later.  Acharya </p><p>added that he hoped to discuss ways to cooperate in the </p><p>fight against terrorism, and expressed an interest in </p><p>discussing counter-terrorism issues while in the U.S.  "If </p><p>[the situation in Nepal] gets out of control, it will </p><p>cause problems for everybody," Acharya concluded. </p><p> </p><p>Trade </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ForSec plans to raise trade issues during his </p><p>visit, focussing on quotas for Nepal\'s garments and GSP </p><p>consideration for its carpets.  He will press for making </p><p>landlocked Least Developed Countries a special category </p><p>for trade purposes, or at least for providing a temporary </p><p>waiver for products from such countries.  [Note:  Acharya </p><p>indicated that his Embassy in Washington was attempting to </p><p>arrange an appointment with USTR as well as with </p><p>Congressional leaders.]  On the economic side, Acharya </p><p>noted that Parliament\'s budget session was coming up and </p><p>the government would need help to avoid starving </p><p>development activities by diverting more funds for </p><p>security purposes. </p><p> </p><p>Domestic Politics and Human Rights </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Ambassador advised ForSec Acharya that his </p><p>interlocutors in Washington will be interested in hearing </p><p>from him about the domestic political situation and human </p><p>rights in Nepal.  Acharya replied that political stability </p><p>was a prerequisite for solving Nepal\'s problems, and the </p><p>government\'s position was that any change in government </p><p>must take place within a constitutional framework.  Taking </p><p>note of yesterday\'s release of four journalists from </p><p>military custody (Reftel), Acharya indicated that Nepal\'s </p><p>intentions were good in regard to human rights.  When the </p><p>Ambassador asked about the status of ICRC\'s headquarters </p><p>agreement with Nepal - reportedly held up in the Foreign </p><p>Ministry - Acharya responded that they were in the "final </p><p>stages" of the process and expected a decision next week. </p><p> </p><p>Next Stop London </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Acharya will stop in London for consultations </p><p>with his British counterparts on his way back to Nepal. </p><p>We understand that Acharya also will soon be traveling to </p><p>Moscow. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Secretary\'s January visit to Nepal raised </p><p>spirits here, and the Nepalese hope to use their Foreign </p><p>Secretary\'s visit to raise Nepal\'s profile in Washington, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>and - more immediately - to raise much-needed development </p><p>and security assistance.  As Acharya pointed out, without </p><p>increased support at this time, Nepal\'s problems will </p><p>become more serious and intractable. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
