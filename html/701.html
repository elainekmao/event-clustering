<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L CARACAS 10003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PINR, CU, VE </p><p>SUBJECT:   CASTRO GREETS FORMER COUP LEADER CHAVEZ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CARACAS NEWSPAPERS GAVE FRONT PAGE COVERAGE </p><p>DECEMBER 15 TO THE VISIT TO HAVANA OF RETIRED ARMY LT. </p><p>COL. HUGO CHAVEZ.  FEATURING PHOTOS OF FIDEL CASTRO </p><p>EMBRACING CHAVEZ, THE PRESS REPORTED THAT THE CUBAN </p><p>PRESIDENT WENT TO THE AIRPORT TO GREET THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>LEADER OF THE FAILED FEBRUARY 1992 COUP AGAINST THEN </p><p>PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.  CHAVEZ WAS REPORTEDLY </p><p>INVITED TO CUBA TO LECTURE ON SIMON BOLIVAR.  THE PRESS </p><p>NOTED THAT CASTRO WAS IRONICALLY ONE OF THE FIRST FOREIGN </p><p>LEADERS TO SEND A TELEGRAM IN SUPPORT OF FORMER PRESIDENT </p><p>PEREZ AFTER THE FEBRUARY 1992 COUP ATTEMPT, AND NOW THE </p><p>CUBAN CHIEF IS TREATING THE MAN WHO ORCHESTRATED THE COUP </p><p>MUCH LIKE A VISITING HEAD OF STATE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PROFESSING HIS ADMIRATION FOR CUBA ("THE </p><p>AUTHENTIC BOLIVARIAN DREAM BREATHES HERE"), CHAVEZ </p><p>AFFIRMED THAT VENEZUELA REQUIRED A ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, </p><p>POLITICAL, AND MORAL REVOLUTION.  HE CALLED THE GOV A </p><p>"CIVILIAN DICTATORSHIP DISGUISED AS A DEMOCRACY".  THE </p><p>LEADER OF THE "BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT 200" </p><p>(MBR-200) ALSO ASSERTED THAT HIS GROUP WOULD SEEK POWER IN </p><p>VENEZUELA DEMOCRATICALLY.  AT THE SAME TIME, CHAVEZ </p><p>REITERATED THAT HE WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE </p><p>ELECTIONS UNLESS THE "RULES OF THE GAME ARE CHANGED." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (LOU)  ON THE AFTERNOON OF DECEMBER 15, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER MIGUEL ANGEL BURELLI RIVAS REPORTEDLY CALLED IN </p><p>GERMAN GARCIA OTERO, THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR IN CARACAS, TO </p><p>"LAY OUT THE VENEZUELAN POSITION" TOWARDS CHAVEZ\' WARM </p><p>RECEPTION.  THE LACK OF PUBLIC COMMENTS REGARDING WHAT WAS </p><p>SAID DURING MEETING LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THE EXCHANGE WAS </p><p>COLD.  TWO DAYS LATER BURELLI RIVAS FELT COMPELLED TO </p><p>COMMENT THAT HIS EXCHANGE WITH GARCIA OTERO DEALT ONLY </p><p>WITH BILATERAL ISSUES.  THE MINISTER ALSO ASSERTED THAT </p><p>THE RETURN TO CARACAS OF THE VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR IN </p><p>HAVANA HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHAVEZ INCIDENT.  IN </p><p>OTHER REACTION, THE ARCHBISHOP OF BARQUISIMETO COMMENTED </p><p>ON THE CHAVEZ VISIT IN HIS TELEVISED CHRISTMAS MESSAGE, </p><p>BLASTING CHAVEZ FOR COMPARING CASTRO\'S CUBAN DICTATORSHIP </p><p>TO THE BOLIVARIAN DREAM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  IT IS NOT IMMEDIATELY EVIDENT WHAT </p><p>DOMESTIC POLITICAL BENEFIT CHAVEZ EXPECTS TO DERIVE FROM </p><p>HIS VISIT TO CUBA AND MEETING WITH CASTRO.  IF ANYTHING, </p><p>IN THE EYES OF MOST VENEZUELANS THE ENCOUNTER WILL MORE </p><p>CLEARLY PLACE THE NATIONALISTIC, POLITICALLY AMBIGUOUS </p><p>CHAVEZ AND HIS MBR IN THE POLITICAL CAMP OF THE FAR LEFT. </p><p>THE CUBAN MODEL IS NOT ONE THAT HAS MANY SUPPORTERS HERE, </p><p>SO HIS FLIRTING WITH CASTRO WOULD NOT SEEM A MOVE THAT </p><p>WOULD WIN HIM VAST SUPPORT AT HOME.  ON THE CONTRARY, A </p><p>PERCEPTION THAT HE IS CLOSE TO CASTRO COULD COST CHAVEZ </p><p>POLITICALLY SINCE A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF HIS SUPPORT </p><p>DERIVES FROM THE VIEW THAT HE IS AN ANTI-SYSTEM POPULIST, </p><p>NOT THAT HE IS A LEFTIST.  WE PRESUME THAT FROM THE CUBAN </p><p>PERSPECTIVE THE HIGH LEVEL ATTENTION PAID TO CHAVEZ WAS </p><p>CASTRO\'S WAY OF SIGNALING HIS DISPLEASURE WITH THE GOV </p><p>OVER VENEZUELA\'S COMMENTS ON THE NEED TO DEMOCRATIZE </p><p>CUBA.  BURELLI RIVAS\' CALLING IN THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR </p><p>PROVIDED THE GOV RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>DAVIDOW </p><p></p></div>
