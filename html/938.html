<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ISLAMABAD 003966 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/TUELLER </p><p>CINCPAC/CENTCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05/28/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MNUC, IN, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRIME MINISTER SUCCUMBS TO DOMESTIC PRESSURE, AND </p><p>PAKISTAN CONDUCTS FIVE NUCLEAR TESTS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLCOUNS DAN MOZENA.  REASON:  1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SOMBER AND TIRED LOOKING, PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF TOLD </p><p>HIS NATION MAY 28 EVENING THAT PAKISTAN HAD SUCCESSFULLY EXPLODED </p><p>FIVE NUCLEAR DEVICES SEVERAL HOURS EARLIER IN THE DAY.  A RECURRING </p><p>THEME THROUGHOUT THE SPEECH WAS THE FAILURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR THREAT </p><p>BEGINNING AS FAR BACK AS THE INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST IN 1974 AND AS </p><p>RECENTLY AS THE TESTS CONDUCTED EARLIER THIS MONTH.  NAWAZ SAID IF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD TAKEN THE INDIAN THREAT SERIOUSLY, </p><p>THEN PAKISTAN MIGHT NOT HAVE NEEDED TO TEST. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) NAWAZ TRIED TO STEEL HIS NATION FOR TOUGH TIMES AHEAD AND </p><p>DECLARED THAT HE AND ALL GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY LEADERS WERE READY </p><p>FOR AN ERA OF AUSTERITY AND SIMPLICITY, STARTING WITH NAWAZ\'S </p><p>GIVING UP THE NEWLY-OPENED AND PALATIAL PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>SECRETARIAT BUILDING, WHICH HE PROPOSED COULD BE CONVERTED INTO A </p><p>HOSPITAL, WOMEN\'S UNIVERSITY, OR SOME OTHER CHARITY USE.  HE URGED </p><p>PAKISTANIS TO BRACE THEMSELVES FOR DIFFICULT TIMES AHEAD AND TO </p><p>FACE THESE DIFFICULTIES COURAGEOUSLY AND BOLDLY.  HE DECLARED </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S OPTIONS OF BECOMING SLAVES OR LEADING HONORABLE AND </p><p>INDEPENDENT LIVES LEFT PAKISTAN NO CHOICE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) REFLECTING INDO-PAK TIT-FOR-TAT MENTALITY, NAWAZ SAID </p><p>PAKISTAN HAD RESPONDED TO INDIA\'S MISSILE TESTS WITH ITS OWN TEST </p><p>OF THE GHAURI MISSILE LAST MONTH, AND PAKISTAN HAS NOW RESPONDED TO </p><p>INDIA\'S FIVE NUCLEAR TESTS WITH FIVE OF ITS OWN.  HE DECLARED THAT </p><p>THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE PAST DAYS IS NOW GONE, AND IF INDIA IS </p><p>AGGRESSIVE, PAKISTAN WILL FIGHT BACK -- THE ARMED FORCES ARE </p><p>PREPARED TO FIGHT AND THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS ARE PREPARED TO MEET </p><p>ANY CHALLENGE.  NAWAZ SAID THAT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS HE WILL AGAIN </p><p>SPEAK TO THE NATION TO ANNOUNCE A "NATIONAL AGENDA." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN A DIPLOMATIC SOP, NAWAZ PRAISED THE CHINESE, WHOM HE </p><p>CALLED GREAT AND RELIABLE FRIENDS AND EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR </p><p>THE JAPANESE, WHOM HE SAID WOULD HAVE AVOIDED HAVING HAD THEIR </p><p>CITIES SUBJECTED TO NUCLEAR ATTACK HAD JAPAN HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS. </p><p>HE SAID HE WAS GRATEFUL FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S FIVE CALLS AND SAID </p><p>THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTOOD PAKISTAN\'S DIFFICULTIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  AT THE END OF THE DAY, NAWAZ FELL VICTIM TO THE </p><p>HARDLINERS BOTH IN THE OPPOSITION AND WITHIN HIS OWN GOVERNMENT WHO </p><p>WERE RELENTLESS IN WHIPPING UP A MEDIA FRENZY DEMANDING A PAKISTANI </p><p>RESPONSE IN KIND.  THERE WERE FEW EFFECTIVE DOMESTIC COUNTERVAILING </p><p>FORCES BUILDING MEDIA AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR RESTRAINT.  NAWAZ\'S </p><p>DECISION TO TEST WAS FUELED BY CONCERNS THAT HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO </p><p>GIVE HIS FRAGMENTED OPPOSITION THE "NAWAZ-IS-WEAK-ON-INDIA" ISSUE </p><p>TO COALESCE AROUND IN THEIR BID TO FORCE HIM FROM POWER.  IN HIS </p><p>SPEECH, NAWAZ PLAYED TO PAKISTANI FEARS OF INDIAN EXPANSIONISM AND </p><p>DISTRUST OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW </p><p>LONG PAKISTANIS WILL RALLY AROUND THE FLAG ONCE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SANCTIONS KICK IN, FURTHER CHALLENGING THIS ALREADY VULNERABLE </p><p>ECONOMY.  NAWAZ\'S NOTION THAT PAKISTANIS WILL "SACRIFICE" BY GIVING </p><p>UP LONG CHERISHED "RIGHTS" SUCH AS STEALING NATURAL GAS AND </p><p>ELECTRICITY AND AVOIDING TAXES STRIKE US AS MORE WISHFUL THAN </p><p>REALISTIC.  PAKISTANIS HAVE ALWAYS PREFERRED TALKING ABOUT EATING </p><p>GRASS (IN PURSUIT OF NATIONAL SECURITY) RATHER THAN ACTUALLY HAVING </p><p>TO EAT IT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMONS </p><p></p></div>
