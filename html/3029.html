Local papers report that the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) </p><p>inflicted heavy casualties on Maoist insurgents who were </p><p>attempting to overrun a security forces camp in Khara, Rukum </p><p>(one of the five districts comprising the Maoist heartland). </p><p>Maoists attacked the camp, garrisoned by approximately 50 RNA </p><p>soldiers and 20 Nepal Police officers, beginning about 10:00 </p><p>p.m. on May 27 and ending at around 4:00 a.m., May 28.  The </p><p>camp\'s garrison was deployed to Khara as part of the </p><p>Integrated Security and Development Program.  The reports </p><p>state that 5 RNA soldiers were killed and 19 injured in the </p><p>engagement; the bodies of at least 100 Maoists are said to </p><p>have been recovered, as well as approximately 80 weapons, </p><p>including a light machine gun.

Accounts of the fighting from </p><p>Embassy sources are consistent with the press reporting. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
