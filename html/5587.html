<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PRISTINA 000177 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL, INL, EUR/SCE; NSC FOR TEPPER; DOJ FOR PEEBLES </p><p>AND HUDGISON; USAID FOR EE/ECA AND EE/DGSR; USOSCE FOR ODLUM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, NATO, YI </p><p>SUBJECT: AAK ADAMANT ON INDEPENDENCE DECLARATION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY COM RENO HARNISH; REASON 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  IN A FEBRUARY 6 MEETING MARKED BY FRANK </p><p>EXCHANGES, COM TOLD AAK PRESIDENT HARADINAJ THAT HIS PARTY\'S </p><p>DRAFT DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WAS AN UNWELCOME AND </p><p>POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING DIVERSION THAT LEAVES THE REAL </p><p>BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT SADLY NEGLECTED.  COM ASKED HARADINAJ </p><p>TO CONSIDER WITHDRAWING IT FROM THE ASSEMBLY AGENDA. </p><p>HARADINAJ ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE DECLARATION HAS NO CHANCE OF </p><p>ENACTMENT THIS YEAR BUT INSISTED ITS PRESENT VALUE WOULD BE </p><p>IN FRAMING A DEBATE THAT WOULD REACH FRUITION IN FUTURE </p><p>YEARS.  HE AGREED THAT KOSOVO\'S GOVERNMENT HAD TO DO A BETTER </p><p>JOB AND CONFIDED THAT, TO THIS END, ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT DACI </p><p>IS WORKING WITH BRITISH INTERMEDIARIES TO ARRANGE A MEETING </p><p>IN SWITZERLAND WITH PARLIAMENTARIANS FROM SERBIA TO DISCUSS </p><p>PRAGMATIC ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) COM, DPO, AND ECON-POL CHIEF MET ON FEBRUARY 6 WITH </p><p>ALLIANCE FOR THE FUTURE OF KOSOVO (AAK) PRESIDENT RAMUSH </p><p>HARADINAJ TO URGE RECONSIDERATION OF HIS PARTY\'S DRAFT </p><p>DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE (ENGLISH TRANSLATION FORWARDED </p><p>PREVIOUSLY).  COM TOLD HARADINAJ THE USG CONSIDERS BOTH THE </p><p>AAK DRAFT AND SERBIAN PM DJINDJIC\'S CALL FOR FINAL STATUS </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE "MANUFACTURED CRISES" </p><p>THAT ARE PARTICULARLY UNWELCOME IN WASHINGTON AT THIS TIME </p><p>WHEN USG\'S FOCUS IS OUT OF EUROPE.  COM SAID NEITHER </p><p>INITIATIVE HAS ANY PROSPECT WHATSOEVER OF GAINING USG </p><p>SUPPORT.  THE MISGUIDED EFFORTS, HE ADDED, STOOD TO BENEFIT </p><p>ONLY EXTREMIST ENEMIES OF PEACE IN KOSOVO WHO WOULD DELIGHT </p><p>IN WATCHING DISCORD GROW BETWEEN KOSOVO\'S ALBANIAN AND SERB </p><p>COMMUNITIES.  FINALLY, COM URGED HARADINAJ TO CONSIDER THAT </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S SERIOUS SUPPORT FOR KOSOVO WAS </p><p>NOT BEING MATCHED BY SIMILARLY SERIOUS EFFORT ON THE PART OF </p><p>THE KOSOVARS WHO HEAD THE PROVISIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF </p><p>SELF-GOVERNMENT (PISG).  HE SAID THE KOSOVO ASSEMBLY IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, WITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS, HAD SHOWN LITTLE </p><p>INTEREST AND LESS EXPERTISE IN THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>URGED HARADINAJ AND COLLEAGUES TO GET ABOUT THE ESSENTIAL IF </p><p>MUNDANE GROUNDWORK NECESSARY TO PRIVATIZATION AND ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN GRANDSTANDING ON INDEPENDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) HARADINAJ REPLIED IN SIMILAR CIVIL YET FRANK TONES. </p><p>TAKING AS HIS POINT OF DEPARTURE THE RECENT SERBIA-MONTENEGRO </p><p>PREAMBLE REFERENCE TO KOSOVO AS PART OF SERBIA, HE SAID "A </p><p>SIMILAR THING HAPPENED IN 1974 WHEN THE FRY CONSTITUTION </p><p>REFERRED TO KOSOVO AS PART BOTH OF YUGOSLAVIA AND SERBIA." </p><p>THEN, AS NOW, HE SAID THE KOSOVARS WERE TOLD THAT THE </p><p>REFERENCE WAS MEANINGLESS BUT KOSOVO THEN SPENT DECADES </p><p>TRYING TO GET OUT OF THOSE BOXES.  THE IC, HE SAID, DID NOT </p><p>GO TO BELGRADE ON THE SERBIA-MONTENEGRO CHARTER AS IT IS NOW </p><p>COMING TO PRISTINA TO SAY, "THIS IS DESTABILIZING; DON\'T DO </p><p>THIS."  HE AGREED THE PISG MUST DO A BETTER JOB AND OFFERED </p><p>TO REDOUBLE EFFORTS BUT DID NOT SEE PRAGMATIC GOVERNANCE AS </p><p>INCONSISTENT WITH A DEBATE ON INDEPENDENCE.  HE VOLUNTEERED </p><p>THAT KOSOVO WOULD NOT ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE THIS YEAR BUT </p><p>INSISTED THAT MOVING THE DISCUSSION IN THIS DIRECTION IS A </p><p>SIGN THAT A "MATURING" AAK IS READY TO "TELL OUR FRIENDS NOT </p><p>JUST WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR."  HE SUGGESTED THAT THE USG </p><p>SHOULD JUST ALLOW THE DECLARATION DEBATE TO UNFOLD SO AS NOT </p><p>TO BE DISTRACTED FROM PRESSING CONCERNS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE </p><p>WORLD.  COM ASSURED HIM THE USG WOULD CONTINUE TO DEVOTE </p><p>ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO KOSOVO AND WOULD NOT STAND BY AND ALLOW </p><p>PRISTINA-BELGRADE TENSIONS TO MOUNT OVER MANUFACTURED CRISES. </p><p> </p><p>PRISTINA-BELGRADE ASSEMBLY INITIATIVE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN REACTION TO COM RECURRING SUGGESTION THAT THE PISG </p><p>SHOULD FOCUS ON GOVERNANCE OVER INDEPENDENCE, HARADINAJ </p><p>CONFIDED THAT (ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT NEXHAT) DACI ON FEBRUARY 5 </p><p>TOLD HIM HE WAS WORKING WITH BRITISH INTERMEDIARIES ON A PLAN </p><p>FOR THE PARLIAMENTS OF KOSOVO AND SERBIA TO BEGIN </p><p>CONSIDERATION OF TECHNICAL ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN.  DACI </p><p>AND A KOSOVO ASSEMBLY DELEGATION ARE MAKING PLANS TO TRAVEL </p><p>TO SWITZERLAND FOR NGO-SPONSORED MEETINGS.  THE PLAN CALLS </p><p>FOR A DELEGATION FROM THE SERBIAN PARLIAMENT TO TRAVEL TO </p><p>SWITZERLAND AT THE SAME TIME ON UNRELATED BUSINESS AND FOR </p><p>DACI AND HIS SERBIAN COUNTERPART TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE </p><p>TRIPS TO MEET AND PAVE THE WAY FOR MORE FORMAL PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>CONTACT TO FOCUS ON TECHNICAL TOPICS SELECTED FOR LACK OF </p><p>POLITICAL OVERTONE. </p><p> </p><p>HARNISH </p><p></p></div>
