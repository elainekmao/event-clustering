<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001218 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: RUMORED PROMOTIONS IN THE SPDC </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  News services are reporting that the State </p><p>Peace and Development Council has promoted some of its top </p><p>generals.  Although the SPDC has not officially announced the </p><p>promotions, rumors in Rangoon appear to indicate that at </p><p>least four of the top Generals may have been promoted.  If </p><p>true, the promotions would be a further consolidation of </p><p>power by Senior General Than Shwe, ensuring control over his </p><p>top echelons.  It is too early to judge whether this </p><p>consolidation of power would indicate that the Senior General </p><p>is positioning for continued military control of the country </p><p>or if he may be setting the stage for a transition to </p><p>civilian government. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Information provided by Embassy contacts appears to </p><p>support reports by Kyodo News and the BBC that the SPDC has </p><p>promoted some of its top brass.  Although the SPDC has not </p><p>announced any promotions, rumors in Rangoon indicate that at </p><p>least four of the senior brass may have been promoted; </p><p>General Maung Aye has been promoted to Deputy Senior General, </p><p>Lt. General Khin Nyunt has been promoted to General, and two </p><p>Major Generals, Thura Shwe Mann and Kyaw Win, have been </p><p>promoted to Lt. Generals.  If these promotions are confirmed, </p><p>they will indicate a consolidation of power by Senior General </p><p>Than Shwe.  Promoting Maung Aye to Deputy Senior General ( a </p><p>position that has never existed before) will end speculation </p><p>on possible jockeying for position between he and Lt. General </p><p>Khin Nyunt.  Promoting Khin Nyunt to General, reportedly with </p><p>duties as "Military Advisor," will move him up from his </p><p>traditional role as head of the country\'s infamous Military </p><p>Intelligence.  This may help make him more palatable with the </p><p>international community as a regime interlocutor and put to </p><p>rest doubts about any lingering allegiance to his mentor, </p><p>ex-strongman General Ne Win.  Kyaw Win will presumably take </p><p>up Khin Nyunt\'s old position as intelligence chief and Thura </p><p>Shwe Mann, who is now Chief of Staff - Army, may move up into </p><p>Maung Aye\'s position of Deputy Commander in Chief of Defense </p><p>Services.  Both of these Generals are stalwart Than Shwe </p><p>supporters.  Their positions just below Maung Aye and Khin </p><p>Nyunt will keep the latter focused on supporting the Senior </p><p>General.  If there are any weaknesses, they will know they </p><p>could easily be replaced. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Again these promotions are still just rumors at this </p><p>point.  If they are verified, they are clearly an effort by </p><p>Senior General Than Shwe to consolidate his position and </p><p>control.  It is still too early to judge, however, whether </p><p>these moves would indicate his desire to perpetuate military </p><p>control of the country or perhaps move slowly toward some </p><p>form of civilian control.  There is speculation that the SPDC </p><p>will have to do something soon to mitigate international </p><p>criticism that it has stalled on progress toward dialogue </p><p>with the NLD.  This consolidation may be part of a strategy </p><p>to defray this criticism.  That strategy, if it exists, is </p><p>not yet clear to Rangoon observers. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
