<p>UNCLAS CAIRO 005603 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, EG, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUSO1: EGYPT RESPONDS TO U.S. DISASTER </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>OFFICIAL CONTACTS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT REACTED QUICKLY TO THE HORRIFIC </p><p>EVENTS IN THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11.  A CLEARLY </p><p>DISTRAUGHT PRESIDENT MUBARAK APPEARED ON TELEVISION, </p><p>EXPRESSING SORROW AND SADNESS AT THE EVENTS.  HE LATER CALLED </p><p>A CABINET MEETING, DIRECTING THAT ALL FORMS OF ASSISTANCE BE </p><p>OFFERED TO THE EMBASSY.  DEFENSE MINISTER TANTAWI, AS WELL AS </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER MAHER, WERE IN CONTACT WITH THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>DURING THE EVENING TO INSURE THAT U.S. NEEDS WERE MET.  ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE SECRETARY-GENERAL AMR MOUSSA PHONED THE AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>EXPRESS CONDOLENCES, AND IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS EXPRESSED </p><p>THE SAME SENTIMENTS.  AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 12, SHEIKH </p><p>TANTAWI OF AL-AZHAR TOLD "WAFD" REPORTER THAT HE WAS PAINED </p><p>BY THIS ACT AND OFFERED CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES. AT THE SAME TIME, HE CONDEMNED ACTS COMMITTED BY </p><p>ISRAEL AND ASKED THAT THE U.S. NOT JUMP TO QUICK CONCLUSIONS </p><p>AS TO THE PERPETRATORS. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>THE MEDIA </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  MOST PAPERS FRONT-PAGED MUBARAK\'S STATEMENTS OF SYMPATHY, </p><p>CONDOLENCES, AND DENUNCIATION OF TERRORIST ATTACKS "UNDER ANY </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES." PAPERS ALSO QUOTED PRESIDENT BUSH ON HOW </p><p>THOSE RESPONSIBLE WOULD BE IDENTIFIED AND PUNISHED.  MOST </p><p>PAPERS REPORTED THE CLOSURE OF THE EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  POPULAR TV MORNING CURRENT AFFAIRS PROGRAM "SUBAH </p><p>AL-KHAYR" INTERVIEWED AN EGYPTIAN GENERAL WHO SAID THE </p><p>ATTACKS REVEAL THE WEAKNESS OF AMERICAN SECURITY AND THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF A CAPABLE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.  ANOTHER EGYPTIAN </p><p>MILITARY EXPERT WAS SHOWN ON T.V. SAYING, THAT GLOBALIZATION, </p><p>THE GULF WAR, AND THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT WERE </p><p>PROBABLE MOTIVES FOR THE ATTACK, ADDING THAT THE OPERATION </p><p>WAS BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF ANY NON-STATE ENTITY. </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENT PREDICTABLY RUNS THE GAMUT FROM SOLE </p><p>CONDOLENCE AND CONDEMNATION TO A MIXED MESSAGE COMBINING THE </p><p>ABOVE BUT LINKING THE ATTACKS TO ALLEGED U.S. SUPPORT FOR </p><p>ISRAELI "TERRORISM." </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>OTHERS </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) ISSUED A STATEMENT OF SHOCK, </p><p>EXPRESSING REGRET AT THIS ATTCK AGAINST ALL HUMAN VALUES. </p><p>THE MB ALSO DENOUNCED "ALL AGGRESSION AGAINST HUMAN VALUES </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ON THE SECURITY SIDE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  CONTACTS REPORT THAT SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS (NFI) WERE </p><p>ARRESTED IN HOMES AND COFFEEHOUSES BY POLICE AND HAULED OFF </p><p>IN SECURITY VANS IN THE PYRAMIDS-KERDASSA AREA LAST NIGHT. </p><p>AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF CAIRO WILL STAY CLOSED THROUGH </p><p>SEPTEMBER 12.  AIRPORT SECURITY IS REPORTEDLY EXTREMELY TIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>FROM THE STREET </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS EXPECTED, PUBLIC OPINION RAN THE GAMUT FROM COMPLETE </p><p>SYMPATHY TO DOWNRIGHT SATISFACTION.  WE AND OUR FSN STAFF </p><p>CANVASSED REACTION OF INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT SOCIAL, </p><p>ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL GROUPS.  THOSE FROM POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES, NGOS, HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE </p><p>KILLING OF CIVILIANS, WITH MANY ADDING THAT THE ATTACKS, </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY REFLECTED THE PROBLEMS WITH U.S. POLICY IN THE </p><p>REGION.  A MINORITY EXPRESSED SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS BUT </p><p>HAD NO VIEW ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ON THE POLITICS OF THE </p><p>ATTACKS.  FINALLY, NEWS VENDORS, SERVANTS, CAB DRIVERS, AND </p><p>COFFEEHOUSE PATRONS GENERALLY EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH THE </p><p>ATTACKS, SAYING THAT PALESTINIANS HAD EXPERIENCED THIS FOR </p><p>MANY YEARS, NOW, FINALLY, IT WAS AMERICA\'S TURN. </p><p>INTERESTINGLY, A LEFT-LEANING CONTACT AND OWNER OF A </p><p>COFFEESHOP TOLD US THAT AFTER THE FIRST REPORTS OF A </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACK OCCURRED IN THE U.S., THERE WAS A GENERAL </p><p>SENSE AMONG THE SEVERAL PATRONS THAT THE U.S. WOULD KNOW NOW </p><p>"HOW IT FELT." HOWEVER, AFTER THE MAGNITUDE OF THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION BEGAN TO BE TELEVISED, OUR CONTACT REPORTED THAT </p><p>SILENCE FELL OVER THE SHOP AND FURTHER TALK OF APPROVAL </p><p>COMPLETELY CEASED. </p><p> </p><p>WELCH </p><p></p></div>
