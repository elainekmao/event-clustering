<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000642 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPAP FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ - OPINION </p><p>PIECES; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The March 30 editions of the government- </p><p>      controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail" and the pro- </p><p>      government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" carried a number </p><p>      of opinion pieces focusing on the war in Iraq. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "U.N. becomes irrelevant" the "The </p><p>      Sunday Mail" (03/30) carried the following opinion </p><p>      piece by William Godwin Nhara, Executive Director of </p><p>      the Southern African Institute for Democracy and Good </p><p>      Governance: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The unilateral invasion of Iraq by the </p><p>      U.S., the United Kingdom and four others will </p><p>      have reverberating and long-lasting </p><p>      consequences.  This unholy alliance has thrown </p><p>      the United Nations, its covenants and Charter </p><p>      out of the window and plunged the world body </p><p>      into an irrelevant body (sic) that will </p><p>      henceforth not have any moral voice and </p><p>      authority within international diplomacy and </p><p>      relations. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "U.S., UK seek to silence Iraqis" </p><p>      the same newspaper carried the following opinion piece </p><p>      by Tafataona Mahoso: </p><p> </p><p>      "On March 26, the U.S. and the UK authorized, </p><p>      carried out and tried to justify the bombing of </p><p>      the Iraqi television system.  This act followed </p><p>      a similar one on April 24, 1999, when NATO </p><p>      forces bombed and destroyed Serbian television </p><p>      studios in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, killing at </p><p>      least 20 journalists. . .   These two cases </p><p>      indicate that, when it suits them, the </p><p>      imperialist powers will not hesitate to trash </p><p>      their own usual slogans about free flow of </p><p>      information, free flow of ideas, freedom of </p><p>      conscience, freedom of expression and freedom of </p><p>      the Press. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Attack on Iraq compromises U.N. </p><p>      peace efforts" the "Sunday Mail" (03/30) also carried </p><p>      an opinion piece by Clever Chirume: </p><p> </p><p>      "The current attack on Iraq by America and </p><p>      Britain should be castigated as it is an assault </p><p>      on the world\'s most august institution, the </p><p>      United Nations.  It has cast a shadow on the </p><p>      effectiveness of international law and the </p><p>      function of democracy, compromising any future </p><p>      united efforts for peace and stability in the </p><p>      world.  The attack, which comes amid worldwide </p><p>      protests against war, legitimizes state </p><p>      terrorism and violates not only the human rights </p><p>      of the people of Iraq but also the integrity and </p><p>      credibility of the U.N. Security Council and all </p><p>      other U.N. institutions. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Under headline "The U.S./UK invasion of Iraq" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" (03/30) </p><p>      carried the following op-ed: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The (U.S.) National Security Strategy </p><p>      itself is, therefore, an attempt to provide both </p><p>      a justification and framework for the `Manifesto </p><p>      for world dictatorship.\'  Accordingly, the world </p><p>      will have to acknowledge now that the debate on </p><p>      Iraq in the U.N. and, indeed, even the program </p><p>      of weapons inspections that was attendant to it, </p><p>      was completely farcical on the part of a super- </p><p>      power already intent and prepared to invade the </p><p>      Arab country and thereby effect a regime </p><p>      change." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Under headline "And so the world turns" the same </p><p>      newspaper carried an opinion piece by Patricia </p><p>      McFadden about western media coverage of the </p><p>      war: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .All one gets is a deafening cacophony of </p><p>      conformist voices, screeching out the same </p><p>      message over and over about the might and </p><p>      invisibility (sic) of the `coalition\' forces, </p><p>      and the inevitability of the fall of Baghdad. </p><p>      It\'s like playing `cowboys and Indians\' - with </p><p>      the fore-knowledge that the cowboys must win, </p><p>      and there simply cannot be any other outcome to </p><p>      this infamy. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  7.   Under headline "The battle of hearts and minds in </p><p>      Baghdad" the "Sunday Mirror" (03/30) carried an </p><p>      opinion piece by Tendai Chari: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The point is the military control of the </p><p>      media is immoral and a transgression of </p><p>      journalistic ethics.  At the end of the day the </p><p>      news that we get is contaminated with the </p><p>      military\'s points of view.  Manipulation of the </p><p>      media by the invading forces poses the gravest </p><p>      threat to media freedom and independence of the </p><p>      war on Iraq (sic).  The bombing of the Iraq </p><p>      broadcasting station is further testimony that </p><p>      the invading forces are determined to feed the </p><p>      rest of the world with lies while concealing </p><p>      their heinous acts. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
