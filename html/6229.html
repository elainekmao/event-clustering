O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe\'s Ghost Exports: The Case of Fertilizer </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Top executives of Zimbabwe\'s sole </p><p>ammonium nitrate producer charge GOZ officials and others </p><p>are illegally exporting fertilizer, triggering shortages </p><p>on the domestic market. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>A Trail of Illegal Exports </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Although Sable Chemicals is producing 30 percent </p><p>less ammonium nitrate than in 1999, the firm\'s CEO and </p><p>production manager told us the quantity should be </p><p>sufficient to cover present fertilizer needs of </p><p>Zimbabwean farmers.  Since recently dispossessed </p><p>commercial farmers used to account for 70 percent of </p><p>fertilizer sales, demand has dropped precipitously.  Like </p><p>many price-controlled items, however, much of the </p><p>country\'s fertilizer is being illegally exported to </p><p>neighboring countries. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Sable officials said they started to track </p><p>large amounts of Zimbabwe-produced fertilizer in Zambia </p><p>after the GOZ took over the market in mid-2002.  The </p><p>Government buys all domestic fertilizer at the controlled </p><p>price of Z$ 30,000/ton, a net loss for the industry, then </p><p>sells or distributes it on retail and commercial markets. </p><p>The GOZ claims it became the country\'s fertilizer broker </p><p>to ensure product availability for newly-resettled </p><p>farmers.  But Zimbabwe is suffering an acute shortage </p><p>while domestic fertilizer is showing up abroad.  In </p><p>Zambia, for example, it fetches ZS 170,000/ton, almost 6- </p><p>fold the controlled price. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Ironically, the Sable reps say they could earn a </p><p>handsome profit exporting ammonium nitrate to Zambia. </p><p>(Owing to "shortages," the GOZ does not allow the company </p><p>to export.)  They estimate the fertilizer cost for </p><p>Zambian farmers would run Z$ 100-120,000/ton, versus Z$ </p><p>170,000 for clandestine exports.  And by earning foreign </p><p>exchange through exports, Sable would be able to boost </p><p>production. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) This textbook case illustrates why price </p><p>controls invariably lead to profiteering for the few and </p><p>shortages for the many.  Fertilizer, of course, is but </p><p>one of many leakages through Zimbabwe\'s robust informal </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
