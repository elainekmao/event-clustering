<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004376 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) DEFENSE MINISTER GONUL SUSPICIOUS OF MILITARY </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4355 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>B and D. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul has consistently been one </p><p>of the most responsible members of the ruling AK government. </p><p>In the run-up to the failed March 1 vote, he argued within AK </p><p>governing circles for cooperation with the US.  Throughout </p><p>the tense period that followed, he has always placed top </p><p>priority on repairing the relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In the Ambassador\'s 7/10 farewell office call, Gonul </p><p>was true to form.  He did not raise a single objection to the </p><p>US operation against Turkish special forces in northern Iraq, </p><p>and it was clear that there was no doubt in his mind that </p><p>some documents within the Turkish military special forces had </p><p>been up to no good.  He talked only of the values Turkey and </p><p>the US shared and the longstanding friendship between </p><p>governments and peoples that could not be ruined by either </p><p>March 1 or the detention of Turkish troops.  He stressed that </p><p>he had worked hard to prevent the former. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While admitting that explanations of the failed vote </p><p>and its aftermath were unproductive, Gonul did his best to </p><p>put the best light on PM Erdogan\'s behavior.  Just after </p><p>becoming PM 3/14, Erdogan noticed that no Turkish minister </p><p>was slated to attend the American-Turkish Council conference </p><p>in Washington starting two days later.  He asked Gonul to </p><p>attend.  During the ATC, Gonul was unexpectedly asked to meet </p><p>with SECDEF, who, Gonul said, asked for overflight </p><p>permission.  Gonul then called Erdogan, who told Gonul to </p><p>offer either overflight or another motion for stationing of </p><p>US troops.  According to Gonul, SECDEF declined the offer of </p><p>a further motion. Gonul then explained how he, the PM and </p><p>CHOD Ozkok had worked hard to subdue hard-line elements </p><p>within the government, Parliament and military who wanted to </p><p>deny overflight as long as Turkish troops were under American </p><p>pressure not to cross the Turkish border and enter norther </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a further effort to ease the most recent tension </p><p>with the US, Gonul brought in an usually large press </p><p>contingent (after asking the Ambassador\'s permission) at the </p><p>end of the farewell call.  Prior to calling them in, Gonul </p><p>had asked the Ambassador to speak to the the ongoing mil-mil </p><p>joint fact-finding discussions in Ankara, which he did. </p><p>Gonul agreed with the Ambassador that the joint team should </p><p>ascertain all the facts and find a way to avoid further </p><p>incidents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) At a small dinner that evening Gonul hosted in honor </p><p>of the Ambassador and attended by key AK Party members Cuneyt </p><p>Zapsu, Reha Denemec, Yasar Yakis and Vahit Erdem, Gonul </p><p>described with some enthusiasm how the AK-dominated </p><p>Parliament intended to pass the seventh reform package before </p><p>adjourning at the end of the month.  In addition to replacing </p><p>the four-star secretary general of the NSC with a civilian, </p><p>the package would put all defense spending on-budget and thus </p><p>under Parliament\'s control.  He appeared to take special </p><p>pride in the fact that he had drafted that section of the </p><p>package. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
