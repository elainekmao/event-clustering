<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 002371 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA; USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL OADR </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREF, HR, BK, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR RAISES WAR CRIMES, REFUGEE </p><p>          PROBLEMS WITH CROATIAN PRESIDENT, DEFMIN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ZAGREB 2348 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02371  201602Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TUDJMAN, DEFMIN </p><p>SUSAK, AND DEPUTY FM SANADER, ON OTHER SUBJECTS </p><p>(SEPTEL), AMB. GALBRAITH MADE TWO OTHER POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>CRIMINAL ACTS OF CROATIAN OCCUPYING TROOPS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMB. GALBRAITH SAID THAT THE DESECRATION OF GRAVES </p><p>HE HAD WITNESSED IN KASIC (REFTEL), EVIDENTLY COMMITTED </p><p>BY CROATIAN TROOPS WHO OCCUPIED THE VILLAGE FOR 14 </p><p>MONTHS, WAS HORRENDOUS AND UNACCEPTABLE.  BOTH CROATIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS SOUGHT TO DENY CROATIAN RESPONSIBILITY, THEN </p><p>TO ARGUE THAT SERBS HAD DONE MUCH WORSE THINGS AND ON A </p><p>LARGER SCALE, TO CROATS.  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT </p><p>THIS SORT OF DEFENSE WAS LIKE COMPARING THE ACTIONS OF </p><p>A LEGITIMATE POLICE FORCE TO THE MAFIA;  AS A WESTERN </p><p>DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY, CROATIA MUST EXPECT TO BE HELD TO A </p><p>HIGH STANDARD.  MOREOVER, SUCH ACTIONS, AS A PRACTICAL </p><p>MATTER, CREATED ILL WILL THAT WOULD MAKE REINTEGRATION </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT WHEN THE TIME CAME.  GALBRAITH SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT SUSAK CONSIDER GIVING SPECIAL TRAINING TO CROATIAN </p><p>TROOPS TO SENSITIZE THEM ON THESE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>HANDLING OF REFUGEES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02371  201602Z </p><p>4.  AMB. GALBRAITH ALSO INQUIRED ABOUT REPORTS THAT </p><p>SOME 450 REFUGEES FROM THE BANJA LUKA AREA OF BOSNIA- </p><p>HERZEGOVINA HAD BEEN HELD AT THE CONFRONTATION LINE (IN </p><p>UNPA SECTOR WEST), REFUSED CROATIAN PERMISSION TO </p><p>ENTER.  NONE OF THE CROATIAN OFFICIALS PRESENT WAS </p><p>FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE.  PRES. TUDJMAN MADE A PHONE </p><p>CALL AND REPORTED THAT THOSE REFUGEES FROM THE GROUP </p><p>WHO HAD MEDICAL PROBLEMS HAD BEEN ADMITTED IMMEDIATELY. </p><p>THE OTHERS WERE BEING HELD TEMPORARILY, PENDING FINDING </p><p>PLACES FOR THEM TO GO.  THIS WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE </p><p>CONTINUING HEAVY FLOW OF REFUGEES HAD STRAINED </p><p>CROATIA\'S CAPACITY TO ABSORB THEM.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>TUDJMAN ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAD NO INTENTION OF NOT ADMITTING THESE PEOPLE.  "HELP </p><p>US END THIS WAR," HE SAID, SO THAT SUCH PROBLEMS WOULD </p><p>NOT OCCUR. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
