<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 002363 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: DISBURSAL OF SUPPLEMENTAL AID TO JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GHEHM.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (s)  Summary.  With preliminary assessment of the </p><p>political and economic impact of the war in Iraq revealing </p><p>substantially greater costs than foreseen last year, senior </p><p>leadership of the Jordanian government, including King </p><p>Abdullah himself, have urged prompt disbursal of the recently </p><p>appropriated $700 million in supplementary economic </p><p>assistance.  In recent conversations with the Ambassador, the </p><p>King and senior officials have reasserted the Jordanian </p><p>government,s commitment to the economic objectives agreed </p><p>last fall. These officials have proposed a process for </p><p>disbursing U.S. aid that would help defuse short-term </p><p>political pressures while ensuring that it is disbursed </p><p>through the budget to meet fiscal needs as they occur over </p><p>time and with conditions that wean Jordan off its dependency </p><p>on cheap Iraqi oil.  Given the importance of Jordan\'s </p><p>economic and political stability to our fundamental </p><p>objectives in this region, the Embassy strongly supports this </p><p>request for quick action, with follow-up that reinforces our </p><p>seriousness about the need to follow through on policies that </p><p>bolster Jordan\'s economic viability and independence.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Reaffirmed Commitment to Economic Basis for Aid </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (s)  The government of Jordan has affirmed to the </p><p>Ambassador at several levels -- including the King, Prime </p><p>Minister, and ministers of finance, planning and foreign </p><p>affairs -- that it remains committed to the arrangements </p><p>worked out in late 2002 for providing emergency U.S. </p><p>assistance linked to a conflict in Iraq.  In particular, </p><p>Jordan is committed to the overarching objective of using </p><p>U.S. aid within the budget to meet fiscal deficit targets </p><p>agreed with the IMF without having to make socially and </p><p>politically disruptive cuts in budgetary social spending.  In </p><p>addition, Jordan remains committed to using the "breathing </p><p>space" afforded by emergency U.S. assistance to smooth the </p><p>process of transition from its economic dependence on </p><p>concessional Iraqi oil to a market-based system for procuring </p><p>and marketing oil. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Domestic Political Cost of Conflict More than Foreseen </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (s)  At the same time, the King faces a domestic </p><p>political cost from the war that is likely to be much longer </p><p>lasting than he and we foresaw last year.  He and the </p><p>government currently find themselves under intense pressure </p><p>from a public that is angry about the Western military </p><p>toppling of the regime of a neighboring Arab country, </p><p>dismayed by the suffering of the Iraqi people, and </p><p>disillusioned by growing evidence of Jordanian cooperation </p><p>with the Coalition effort.   The King has resisted </p><p>extraordinary pressure for a public denunciation of the </p><p>United States and the coalition called for in an </p><p>unprecedented petition signed by 99 prominent Jordanians, </p><p>including former prime ministers.  Coming along with the </p><p>economic shocks Jordan faces as a result of the war, the </p><p>tensions and pressures on King Abdullah have been greater </p><p>than they ever have been since he took the throne.  Thus, the </p><p>King has an intense need to demonstrate to the Jordanian </p><p>people quickly that the policies he followed were in their </p><p>best interest. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>King\'s Desire to Meet Political and Economic Objectives </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  It is therefore the King\'s need and desire that we </p><p>find a mechanism for disbursing U.S. assistance that will </p><p>simultaneously safeguard its economic objectives and give the </p><p>King greater political latitude to persevere in policies -- </p><p>including parliamentary elections in June -- that support </p><p>fundamental U.S. interests in the region.  Finance Minister </p><p>Marto, in close consultation with the King and Prime </p><p>Minister, has therefore proposed that we transfer as soon as </p><p>possible the entire $700 million amount appropriated in the </p><p>FY03 Supplemental.  Rather than spending it all at once, </p><p>however, the government of Jordan is prepared to place the </p><p>funds in a special account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New </p><p>York or other appropriate institution.  Balances in the </p><p>account would be drawn on as necessary to cover budgetary </p><p>needs caused by revenue reductions or additional spending </p><p>needs linked to the conflict in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (s)  The government says it will need to draw on $500 </p><p>million of the assistance quickly (see paras 7-10 below).  To </p><p>preserve the commitment to sequence reforms so as to move to </p><p>economic independence while blunting the social costs, the </p><p>government is ready to commit not to draw down the final $200 </p><p>million in the account until a) the IMF has renewed its </p><p>endorsement of Jordan\'s economic program, and b) the cabinet </p><p>has approved a three-year strategy to eliminate all petroleum </p><p>product subsidies and has made a policy "down payment" of an </p><p>initial increase in domestic petroleum product prices.  If it </p><p>makes us more comfortable, the GOJ is also ready to signal </p><p>its commitment to ongoing fiscal soundness by agreeing that </p><p>it will not use the U.S. aid to avoid implementation of </p><p>budgetary revenue measures it has told the IMF it will take </p><p>this year, including increasing General Sales Tax (GST) rates </p><p>and closing loopholes. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Economic Impact Sharper and Deeper than Foreseen </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (s)  Like the stronger than expected political impact of </p><p>the war, the economic costs appear to have come sooner, and </p><p>cut deeper than foreseen last fall.  According to Minister </p><p>Marto, the war will add $950 million to the fiscal deficit in </p><p>2003 alone.  This includes a $360 million additional cost of </p><p>procuring oil outside the Jordan-Iraq barter arrangement for </p><p>the year as a whole.  Of this, $210 million should be offset </p><p>by an expected oil grant of 100,000 bpd from Gulf states for </p><p>three months, so that the net negative deficit impact related </p><p>to oil procurement alone would be $150 million.  This means </p><p>that the government will need to cover a $740 million </p><p>shortfall in order to meet its 2003 deficit target. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  In addition to the $150 million in extra oil costs, </p><p>the shortfall includes $400 million in lower than expected </p><p>budgetary revenue due to reductions in expected collections </p><p>of sales tax, income tax, customs, other taxes and fees, and </p><p>in the "oil surplus" the government earns by selling refined </p><p>Iraqi crude to the public for more than its actual cost. </p><p>Additional expenditures of $190 million will be required to </p><p>mitigate the economic impact of the war on various sectors. </p><p>Marto foresees a need for $60 million for emergency spending </p><p>on industry and labor support (including worker retraining </p><p>programs), $40 million for the transportation sector, and $30 </p><p>million for the tourism industry, with additional amounts </p><p>required to pay for measures necessary in the lead-up to the </p><p>war to prepare for refugee flows (about $10 million) and to </p><p>enhance domestic security. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S)  Marto stresses that these are conservative estimates </p><p>based on the best information available to him at this time. </p><p>If the immediate need is mitigated in any way, he would </p><p>stretch the spending into 2004.  If more resources become </p><p>available from other sources, he would like to use them for </p><p>additional support that would help minimize layoffs in </p><p>sectors (industry, tourism, transportation) that he expects </p><p>to take the hardest hits over the year and to begin </p><p>implementation of projects, through the national budget </p><p>process, contained in the Social and Economic Transformation </p><p>Program (SETP).  Such projects are designed to address basic </p><p>needs in rural and disadvantaged areas, increase long-term </p><p>economic potential and productivity, and bolster popular </p><p>support for the economic reform process. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (s)  The mechanism the Jordanians propose seems eminently </p><p>reasonable.  It directly addresses fundamental U.S. policy </p><p>goals with regard to Jordan:  it contributes to the political </p><p>stability of a key Arab ally committed to expansion of the </p><p>democratic process, and it preserves a commitment to economic </p><p>reform that is unique in this region.  By channeling the </p><p>money from a special account into the budget to meet </p><p>budgetary needs as they arise, it ensures that overspending </p><p>above Jordan\'s "absorptive capacity" is avoided.  Should the </p><p>budgetary needs not materialize to the extent foreseen by </p><p>Marto this year, it would provide for a flexible sequencing </p><p>of spending the aid through the budget over a two or more </p><p>year period.  The King, Prime Minister, and finance, foreign, </p><p>and planning ministers have told us that they are committed </p><p>to such a framework.  The government is also ready to report </p><p>to us regularly and in greater detail on the extraordinary </p><p>fiscal impact of the war, as its impact continues to become </p><p>clear. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (s)  We also share the analysis that the impact of the </p><p>war on the Jordanian economy and budget will be sharp and </p><p>deep, creating potential for more politically disruptive </p><p>dislocations at a critical time for Jordan and the region. </p><p>The World Bank says that Jordan will bear the brunt of the </p><p>regional impact of the conflict and estimates that without </p><p>extraordinary assistance, real GDP growth initially projected </p><p>at over 5% for this year could be in large part wiped out, </p><p>leading to a return to negative per capita income growth. </p><p>According to Jordanian officials, budget revenues in the </p><p>first quarter were already at least $250 million below </p><p>target, due mainly to a reduction in consumption and economic </p><p>activity during the period of uncertainty that preceded the </p><p>conflict.  At the same time, it now seems that recovery could </p><p>be more rapid than foreseen last fall.  Along with continued </p><p>strong growth of exports to the U.S., Jordan\'s business </p><p>sector is moving aggressively to capitalize on new regional </p><p>opportunities in a free Iraq and from hoped-for easing in </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian tension. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (s)  From both a political and economic aspect, the </p><p>embassy urges that we move quickly along the lines proposed </p><p>by the Jordanians.  From a political perspective, we cannot </p><p>afford to take unnecessary risks in Jordan at this juncture </p><p>in the region.  On the economic side, short-term support will </p><p>be crucial, while the longer-term reform objectives are fully </p><p>accepted and reaffirmed.  We have a small window of </p><p>opportunity.  The longer the process in Washington takes, the </p><p>greater the political pressures on the King will be to </p><p>backtrack on both the political and economic sides. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (s)  Finally, we recommend that the USG take advantage </p><p>of upcoming meetings with Jordanian leaders, including a </p><p>possible visit by Foreign Minister Muasher to Washington, to </p><p>reiterate at the highest levels our seriousness about </p><p>Jordan\'s need to follow through with reforms that increase </p><p>its economic independence and sustainability, including the </p><p>elimination of oil price subsidies.  Communications between </p><p>Treasury and Finance Minister Marto at the appropriate time </p><p>could also reinforce that sense of purpose. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
