<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HANOI 001422 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, AF/S, AF/E, AF/PD, AF/W, NEA/ENA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EAID, IV, NI, MA, GV, PU, BN, SG, ZI, RW, AO, SF, MO, WA, CM, VM, --     MZ </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM REACHING OUT TO AFRICA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  01 Hanoi 2637 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  As another symbol of how Vietnam prizes </p><p>the diversity of its diplomatic contacts and seeks to </p><p>maintain its third world credentials, the GVN hosted the </p><p>first Vietnam - Africa Forum in Hanoi May 28-30. </p><p>Delegations from 18 African countries discussed trade and </p><p>investment and "opportunities for the 21st century." </p><p>Vietnam undertakes some developmental activities in Africa, </p><p>albeit financed mainly by the United Nations.  Two-way trade </p><p>remains modest at under USD 250 million, but GVN officials </p><p>claim that there is "much potential for growth."  With trade </p><p>levels at about USD 50 million in 2002, South Africa is the </p><p>most important African trading partner, opening its Embassy </p><p>in Hanoi only in 2002.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>TRADITIONAL FRIENDS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  According to Nguyen Manh Cuong, Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs (MFA) senior expert for West Asia and </p><p>Africa, Vietnam and many African countries have "traditional </p><p>friendships" based upon historical mutual support to </p><p>"overcome colonial powers."  Cuong noted that, while Vietnam </p><p>only has embassies in Libya, Algeria, Egypt, and South </p><p>Africa, "traditional" diplomatic partners in Africa also </p><p>include Sudan, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Angola.  Cuong </p><p>highlighted the importance of the forum, which brought </p><p>representatives from many African countries to Hanoi for the </p><p>time to discuss issues of mutual concern.  In a working </p><p>luncheon on June 5, Xuan Hieu (who attended parts of the </p><p>forum), International Affairs Department Deputy Director of </p><p>the Communist Party of Vietnam\'s flagstaff "People\'s Daily," </p><p>boasted to poloff that Vietnam was "proud to host this first </p><p>event of its kind."  He predicted that the forum will lead </p><p>to "greater mutual understanding and cooperation between </p><p>Vietnam and Africa." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Despite the traditional friendships, there have </p><p>been few high level visits in recent years.  Namibian </p><p>President Sam Nujoma visited Vietnam in 2001.  Robert </p><p>Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, also visited in 2001 </p><p>(reftel).  Vietnam\'s President, Tran Duc Luong, visited </p><p>Angola, Namibia, and Congo in October 2002, after attending </p><p>the Francophone summit in Beirut.  Cuong said that he did </p><p>not know of any upcoming senior visits; however, he </p><p>expressed confidence that there would "undoubtedly be some </p><p>"ministerial level" visits over the next year. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>THE FORUM </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Over 80 delegates attended the forum, including </p><p>four ministers and four deputy ministers.  Representatives </p><p>from eighteen African countries attended:  Egypt, Libya, </p><p>Morocco, Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burundi, Congo, Guinea, </p><p>Mali, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, </p><p>Sudan, Tanzania, and Zambia.  In addition, representatives </p><p>of several Hanoi-based UN agencies, non-governmental </p><p>organizations, and international organizations also </p><p>participated.  Japan sent a representative and several local </p><p>embassies, including France, Italy, and the U.S., sent </p><p>observers.  While Cuong declined to provide exact numbers, </p><p>he admitted that a "sizeable number" of the African </p><p>delegates actually came from regional embassies accredited </p><p>to Vietnam, mostly either in Beijing and Bangkok.  (Note: </p><p>While Vietnam\'s MFA provided hotel accommodations, the </p><p>delegations had to pay their own airfares.  End note). </p><p>Cuong said that concerns about SARS might have had some </p><p>impact, but that only two delegations had actually canceled </p><p>their participation. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Forum attendees heard about 30 presentations from </p><p>various African delegations, other international </p><p>participants, and GVN officials.  Many of the speeches </p><p>reiterated the common desire for realizing "the great trade </p><p>potential" between Vietnam and Africa.  In his keynote </p><p>address, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai emphasized the need to </p><p>move beyond the currently "limited cooperation" and develop </p><p>a "multifaceted approach."  Several speeches commended </p><p>Vietnam for its "south - south" cooperative activities. </p><p>H.K. Angula, Namibia\'s Minister of Agriculture, Water, and </p><p>Rural Development, told the forum that Namibian farmers </p><p>"have a great deal to learn from Vietnam," noting Vietnam\'s </p><p>transformation from a rice importer to one of the world\'s </p><p>leading rice exporters in a relatively short period.  He </p><p>said that Vietnam\'s "comparative advantage" in rice "sets </p><p>the stage" for further bilateral cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  At the conclusion of the forum, Vietnam signed </p><p>several cooperative agreements, including: </p><p>--on agricultural cooperation and fisheries cooperation with </p><p>Sudan; </p><p>--on economic, trade, cultural, and technical cooperation </p><p>with Sierra Leone; and, </p><p>--on trade and investment protection with Namibia. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The forum also included about 150 booths showcasing </p><p>various Vietnamese exports, such as electronics, textiles, </p><p>and agricultural products.  The rather elaborate exhibition </p><p>invited speculation among some observers that export </p><p>promotion might have been an underlying theme of the forum. </p><p>Cuong admitted that Vietnam "would like to sell more </p><p>products to more African countries."  He claimed that there </p><p>is "especially good potential" for rice exports.  Cuong </p><p>maintained, however, that the main purpose of the forum was </p><p>to discuss Vietnam and Africa two-way cooperation, of which </p><p>Vietnam\'s exports is "only one part." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>VIETNAM\'S DEVELOPMENTAL ROLE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Cuong claimed that, while Vietnam is itself a large </p><p>official development assistance (ODA) recipient, the GVN was </p><p>"proud" to have a role in helping African countries.  Cuong </p><p>noted that there are Vietnamese experts working in a number </p><p>of African countries, citing agricultural experts in </p><p>Madagascar, Benin, Congo, and Senegal.  (There are also </p><p>Vietnamese medical doctors in Angola.)  Much of this </p><p>assistance, he admitted, is actually financed through a "two </p><p>plus one" program under the U.N., whereby Vietnam supplies </p><p>the experts and the U.N. supports them and their programs. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>TRADE </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Cuong lamented that, while Vietnam\'s trade with </p><p>Africa had grown by a factor of 10 since 1990, it was still </p><p>"far below potential."  Vietnam\'s 2002 exports to Africa </p><p>totaled about USD 200 million (about one percent of </p><p>Vietnam\'s total exports); its imports from Africa are about </p><p>USD 43 million (about three tenths of one percent of </p><p>Vietnam\'s imports), according to a press report. </p><p>10.  (SBU)  While a number of officials stressed the theme </p><p>of economic potential, others noted that there are serious </p><p>impediments that Vietnam and African countries must overcome </p><p>to realize that potential.  Cuong admitted that lack of </p><p>payment mechanisms is a major factor.  Another is the lack </p><p>of familiarity with culture and customs.  He said that many </p><p>Vietnamese business people were reluctant to do business in </p><p>Africa because "it is sometimes rather hard to get paid." </p><p>Barter trade, while possible, is not going to raise trade </p><p>volume significantly, he opined.  Joseph Bonesha, the </p><p>Rwandan ambassador to the PRC, told poloff on the margin of </p><p>the forum that distance to market was a major problem for </p><p>both Vietnam and African countries.  He noted that Rwanda </p><p>was "very poor" and at this point not able to import much of </p><p>anything from any country.  Guinea\'s Ambassador to Beijing, </p><p>Djigul Camara, predicted to poloff that Vietnam would be </p><p>"hard pressed" to compete with the PRC in Guinea.  He </p><p>estimated that Guinea and the PRC have about USD 100 million </p><p>in two-way trade, with established links.  Camara said that </p><p>the PRC is "similarly well established" in a number of other </p><p>West African countries. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>MOVING FORWARD WITH SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  In October 2002, South Africa opened an embassy in </p><p>Hanoi, headed by a Charge d\'Affaires.  Vietnam had </p><p>established its embassy in South Africa in 1999.  Two-way </p><p>trade, while limited, has grown from USD 20 million in 1999 </p><p>to USD 50 million in 2002, according to a GVN press report, </p><p>making South Africa Vietnam\'s most important African trading </p><p>partner.  Vietnam\'s primary exports include footwear, </p><p>textiles, artificial flowers, coffee, rice, and plastics. </p><p>Its imports include machinery, steel, wood, chemical </p><p>products, and paper.  The trade balance is in favor of South </p><p>Africa by about a three to two ratio, according to South </p><p>African government statistics.  The two countries signed a </p><p>bilateral trade agreement in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  In a speech at the forum, Charles Bailey, Ford </p><p>Foundation representative in Vietnam, highlighted that South </p><p>Africa and Vietnam shared a strong historical relationship </p><p>stemming from their respective independence struggles.  In </p><p>1978, a high-level delegation from the then-banned African </p><p>National Congress (including now-President Mbeki) visited </p><p>Vietnam and met with the top leadership.  According to </p><p>Bailey, this visit made a strong impression on both sides. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)   South African Charge d\'Affaires Elizabeth </p><p>Erasmus told poloff in a sidebar conversation that one of </p><p>South Africa\'s goals in opening an embassy in Hanoi was to </p><p>demonstrate to Vietnam that South Africa can serve as a </p><p>gateway for regional trade.  She noted that it will take </p><p>"considerable effort" to realize this goal, but there are </p><p>plans for further cultural and educational exchanges that </p><p>will also improve mutual understanding.  Commenting on </p><p>Vietnam\'s long-term goals in Africa, Charge Erasmus opined </p><p>that Vietnam may be interested in counterbalancing the PRC\'s </p><p>already strong economic position in a number of African </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  This forum can be viewed as part of Vietnam\'s </p><p>general diplomatic push over the past decade to diversify </p><p>its relations globally.  There are still warm feelings in </p><p>Vietnam for the many African countries that provided moral </p><p>support during wartime, even though the tangible benefits </p><p>nowadays remain minimal.  Lack of infrastructure, vast </p><p>distances, questionable markets, and uncertain business </p><p>practices all suggest that more meaningful Vietnam - Africa </p><p>ties are unlikely in the foreseeable future, despite </p><p>goodwill and good rhetoric. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
