The Turks criticized the mistreatment </p><p>of their troops.  The head of the American team, </p><p>Lieutenant-General John Sylvester, admitted that </p><p>Turkish soldiers were badly treated, but said he was </p><p>not authorized to apologize over the incident.  General </p><p>Sylvester went to Northern Iraq Thursday evening and, </p><p>after his return on Saturday, the commission is </p><p>expected to issue a joint statement regarding the </p><p>future nature of Turkish military activities in the </p><p>region.  The U.S. has agreed that Turkey\'s military </p><p>presence in Northern Iraq should continue until the </p><p>PKK/KADEK threat is eliminated, according to "Radikal." </p><p>"Sabah" says that Americans want the estimated 10,000 </p><p>Turkish troops in Northern Iraq to leave the region. </p><p>Meanwhile, PUK leader Talabani, who was scheduled to be </p><p>in Ankara for talks on Thursday, cancelled his visit to </p><p>avoid a possible clash over the his alleged role in the </p><p>Suleymaniye incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Armenian genocide bill: Vice President Cheney, upset by </p><p>the recent strain in U.S., Turkey ties, lobbied hard </p><p>against a controversial Armenian genocide draft from </p><p>being discussed in the U.S. Congress. "Sabah" reports. </p><p>Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz and Assistant </p><p>Secretary of State Armitage also urged Congressmen to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>block the motion.  The American Jewish Committee (AJC) </p><p>also sent a letter to Congress opposing the bill. </p><p>Reports quote the Armenian parliamentary speaker as </p><p>saying that Yerevan is open to dialog for normalization </p><p>of ties with Turkey. </p><p>EU reforms package: A parliamentary commission approved </p><p>the amendments to the anti-terror law in the 6th EU </p><p>harmonization package.  The amendments had previously </p><p>been vetoed by President Sezer.  Justice Minister and </p><p>government spokesman Cemil Cicek also said that the 7th </p><p>reform package would be submitted to parliament next </p><p>week for enactment before the summer recess.  The </p><p>package would bring changes to the structure of the </p><p>National Security Council (NSC), the penal code, the </p><p>military penal code, and the law of associations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Cumhuriyet" cites a report in the Greek </p><p>Cypriot daily "Politis" that the U.S. has a `new </p><p>formula\' to re-start the Cyprus peace negotiations. </p><p>"Politis" claims that U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator </p><p>Tom Weston will discuss the formula with Turkish </p><p>officials in Ankara next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Turkish Relations/N. Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Suleymaniye Aftermath" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in the mass appeal-conservative </p><p>Turkiye (7/11): "From our perspective, we should be </p><p>able to see the big picture and realize our mistakes </p><p>during the Iraq war.  Turkey\'s position in northern </p><p>Iraq has already been weakened because of these </p><p>mistakes.  Certain other countries also defied the US </p><p>and stood against the military operation.  Yet the </p><p>Europeans will make it up with Washington sooner or </p><p>later.  At this point, Turkey should be very careful to </p><p>take the necessary steps in order not to fall back into </p><p>the Third World.  This issue should be considered as a </p><p>national cause.  From the US perspective, the `Pax </p><p>Americana\' cannot possibly be achieved if Turkey is </p><p>alienated.  Originally, the US wanted to achieve its </p><p>goals with Turkey\'s help, but the parliament\'s </p><p>rejection of the motion gave Washington serious doubts </p><p>about Turkey.  In its long-term planning, Ankara should </p><p>formulate a policy that embraces the US rather than </p><p>standing against it." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Turkish military, CENTCOM and EUCOM" </p><p>Sedat Ergin observed in the mass appeal Hurriyet </p><p>(7/11): "Washington has sent a General to conduct the </p><p>negotiations with Turkey over the Suleymaniye crisis. </p><p>General Sylvester is part of US EUCOM, which is </p><p>headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany.  However, those </p><p>responsible for the incident in northern Iraq are part </p><p>of CENTCOM, based in Tampa, FL. . This interesting </p><p>situation brings up once again one of the major sources </p><p>of tension between the Turkish and American militaries. </p><p>The Turkish military established a healthy working </p><p>relationship with the US military over the last 50 </p><p>years within the framework of NATO. . The cooperative </p><p>military relationship with the US did not face any </p><p>serious issues until the current structural change. </p><p>Today, the military relationship has moved from NATO to </p><p>the Middle East (i.e. from EUCOM to CENTCOM), and this </p><p>new relationship has not yet been well defined." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
