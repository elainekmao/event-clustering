PRESIDENT: </p><p> </p><p>I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION TO </p><p>FEEDING THE HUNGRY AND HELPING THOSE LESS FORTUNATE.  MY </p><p>WHOLE STAFF AND I WERE GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY YOUR STATEMENT </p><p>IN THE STATE OF THE UNION ABOUT HOW GENEROUS AMERICA IS IN </p><p>FEEDING THE WORLD.  IT IS SOMETHING I SAY ALL THE TIME. </p><p>AS YOU KNOW, YOUR PROPOSAL FOR A FAMINE FUND AND THE </p><p>EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF COULD NOT COME AT A BETTER </p><p>TIME.  MORE THAN 38 MILLION PEOPLE ARE THREATENED BY </p><p>STARVATION IN AFRICA ALONE, AND THAT SITUATION IS EVEN MORE </p><p>COMPLEX BECAUSE OF THE AIDS PANDEMIC.  IN ALL OF MY YEARS </p><p>WORKING TO FIGHT HUNGER, I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY SERIOUS </p><p>CRISES DEMANDING SO MUCH ASSISTANCE AT ONCE.  I AM HEADED </p><p>BACK TO ETHIOPIA WHERE I EXPECT TO FIND CHILDREN STARVING, </p><p>AS I DID WHEN I WENT IN 1984. </p><p> </p><p>I KNOW THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT DEMAND YOUR TIME AND </p><p>ATTENTION, BUT I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I </p><p>APPRECIATE YOUR HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>DO OUR BEST TO PUT INTO ACTION AMERICA\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>ALLEVIATE HUNGER AND BUILD HOPE, THROUGH COMMUNICATING AND </p><p>DEMONSTRATING AMERICA\'S COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE IN NEED. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE I HOPE THAT OUR ALLIES IN THE G-8 RESPOND TO YOUR </p><p>INITIATIVE AND CREATE OTHER FAMINE FUNDS, EVEN IF YOU DON\'T </p><p>GET CREDIT ON EARTH, YOU WILL IN HEAVEN. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL THAT YOU\'RE DOING ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>POOR AND HUNGRY.  GOD BLESS. </p><p> </p><p>SINCERELY, TONY P. HALL AMBASSADOR.  END QUOTE. </p><p> </p><p>2.ORIGINAL SIGNED LETTER WILL FOLLOW. </p><p>HALL </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003ROME00432 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
