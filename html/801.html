<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 006003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS AND S/CT FOR REAP/COLLINS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA:  1995 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 245276 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE FOLLOWING IS POST\'S RESPONSE TO REFTEL </p><p>REQUESTING INPUT FOR THE DEPARTMENT\'S 1995 ANNUAL </p><p>TERRORISM REPORT.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA (GSL) </p><p>CONTINUED TO BATTLE AGAINST THE INSURGENT LIBERATION </p><p>TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE), THE ONLY TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION CURRENTLY BELIEVED TO BE ACTIVE IN SRI </p><p>LANKA.  ALTHOUGH THE LTTE OPERATES LARGELY WITHIN </p><p>THE BORDERS OF SRI LANKA, IT IS AN QINTERNATIONALQ </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AS DEFINED IN REFTEL, BECAUSE </p><p>IT HAS ENGAGED IN OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN INDIA </p><p>(MOST NOTABLY THE 1991 ASSASSINATION OF INDIAN PRIME </p><p>MINISTER RAJIV GANDHI) AS WELL AS IN SRI LANKA. IT </p><p>IS ALSO BELIEVED TO LOOK TO FOREIGN SOURCES FOR THE </p><p>TRAINING OF AT LEAST SOME OF ITS CADRES AND FOR MUCH </p><p>OF THE SUPPLIES IT NEEDS TO SUSTAIN ITS CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST GSL -- ESPECIALLY WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES AND </p><p>AMMUNITION.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO </p><p>QUESTIONS A THROUGH H IN PART 3 OF REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (A)  THERE WERE NO GSL PROSECUTIONS OF PEOPLE </p><p>INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SIGNIFICANT </p><p>ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  A NUMBER OF SUSPECTED </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE LTTE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND DETAINED </p><p>UNDER THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND THE PREVENTION </p><p>OF TERRORISM ACT.  WHILE SOME OF THOSE DETAINED HAVE </p><p>BEEN CHARGED WITH RELATIVELY MINOR OFFENSES SUCH AS </p><p>WITHHOLDING INFORMATION, NO IMPORTANT LTTE LEADER </p><p>HAS EVER BEEN APPREHENDED AND PROSECUTED.  THERE </p><p>HAVE BEEN NO TERRORIST ATTACKS INVOLVING AMERICAN </p><p>CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>(B)  THERE WERE NO USG REQUESTS TO SRI LANKA FOR </p><p>EXTRADITION OR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IN JUNE 1995 OFFICIALLY </p><p>REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF LTTE LEADER VELUPILLAI </p><p>PRABHAKARQN, LTTE INTELLIGENCE CHIEF POTTU AMMAN AND </p><p>LTTE WOMEN\'S WING LEADER AKILA (WHO HAS SINCE BEEN </p><p>REPORTED TO HAVE DIED IN BATTLE IN NORTHERN SRI </p><p>LANKA) FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF RAJIV GANDHI. </p><p>(THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN DECLARED QPROCLAIMED </p><p>OFFENDERSQ BY A MADRQS SPECIAL COURT.)  AS OF </p><p>NOVEMBER 1995, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS PREPARING </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DEFENSE MINISTER WHO WILL </p><p>DECIDE WHETHER TO AUTHORIZE THE COLOMBO HIGH COURT </p><p>TO BEGIN EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS.  HOWEVER, IF THE </p><p>GSL DECIDES TO PROCEED WITH THE EXTRADITION </p><p>REQUESTS, THE CHANCES OF APPREHENDING THE TWO </p><p>REMAINING LTTE LEADERS ARE SLIM AS THEY REMAIN WELL- </p><p>PROTECTED IN LTTE-CONTROLLED AREAS IN THE NORTH OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>(C)  WE ARE AWARE OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO </p><p>GSL PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS.  TERRORISM IS ILLEGAL UNDER THE </p><p>PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT.  IN ADDITION, SRI </p><p>LANKAN EXTRADITION LAW PERMITS EXTRADITION TO OTHER </p><p>COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES.  MOREOVER, SRI LANKA IS A </p><p>SIGNATORY TO THE SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION FOR </p><p>REGIONAL COOPERATION (SAARC) REGIONAL CONVENTION ON </p><p>THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORISM.  THEREFORE, THE GSL </p><p>SEEMS OBLIGED TO COOPERATE WITH THE OFFICIAL </p><p>REQUESTS FROM INDIA FOR THE EXTRADITION OF </p><p>PRABHAKARAN AND POTTU AMMAN--THOUGH IT IS LIKELY </p><p>THAT ITS OWN PROSECUTION WOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>(D)  ITSELF A TARGET OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, </p><p>THE GSL HAS BEEN STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF </p><p>TERRORISM.  THE GSL HAS COOPERATED FULLY WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IN THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THE </p><p>RQJIV GANDHI ASSASSINATION AND HAS BEEN QUICK TO </p><p>CONDEMN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTS. </p><p> </p><p>(E)  THE GSL IS CONDUCTING ON-GOING COUNTERTERRORIST </p><p>AND COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS, INCLUDING MILITARY </p><p>ACTIONS AND SPECIAL MEASURES TO PROTECT URBAN AREAS, </p><p>IMPORTANT INSTALLATIONS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS. </p><p>THESE ARE AIMED AT WEAKENING THE LTTE AND INHIBITING </p><p>THEIR ABILITY TO CONDUCT TERRORIST ATTACKS AS WELL </p><p>AS MILITARY OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>(F)  THE GSL DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM IN ANY WAY. </p><p> </p><p>(G)  THE GSL HAS MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A </p><p>TERRORISM ISSUE.  HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT ACTIVELY </p><p>SUPPORTED INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION OF THE </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF LIBYA, IRAQ AND IQQN. </p><p> </p><p>(H)  AT THE YEAR\'S END, THERE HAD BEEN NO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE GSL\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  1995 BEGAN WITH A CEASE-FIRE ON JANUARY 8 </p><p>BETWEEN THE LTTE AND THE GSL.  ON APRIL 19, 1995, </p><p>THE LTTE BROKE THE TRUCE IN AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK </p><p>WHEN IT BLEW UP TWO GOVERNMENT NAVAL VESSELS, </p><p>KILLING 12 SAILORS.  IT ALSO SHOT DOWN TWO AIR FORCE </p><p>TRANSPORT PLANES, KILLING ALMOST 100 SERVICEMEN. </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS AND COUNTER- </p><p>ATTACKS BY BOTH THE LTTE AND THE GOVERNMENT.  THE </p><p>LTTE ONCE AGAIN RESUMED ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS IN MAY, </p><p>KILLING 42 INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN AN </p><p>EASTERN VILLAGE.  IN AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO KILL </p><p>DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER ANURUDDHA RATWATTE, AN LTTE </p><p>SUICIDE BOMBER EXPLODED A BOMB OUTSIDE A LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICE IN COLOMBO IN AUGUST, KILLING 23 </p><p>BYSTANDERS.  IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER, THE LTTE </p><p>CONTINUED TO ATTACK CIVILIANS IN THE EAST, KILLING </p><p>OVER 100 MOSTLY SINHALESE VILLAGERS LIVING IN BORDER </p><p>AREAS.  IT ALSO ASSASSINATED TAMIL POLITICAL RIVALS </p><p>IN THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, </p><p>INCLUDING THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF BATTICALOA TOWN. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE LTTE ATTACKED VITAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>INSTALLATIONS.  IN OCTOBER IT RAIDED TWO OIL STORAGE </p><p>FACILITIES IN COLOMBO, DESTROYING 14 TANKS AND </p><p>KILLING 21 GUARDS AND CIVILIANS.  IT ALSO ATTACKED </p><p>OIL STORAGE TANKS IN BATTICALOA TOWN IN THE EAST. </p><p>AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO BOMB ARMY HEADQUARTERS IN </p><p>COLOMBO IN NOVEMBER RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 16 </p><p>PEOPLE, MOSTLY CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN 1995 THE ELLALAN FORCE - WIDELY SUSPECTED, </p><p>THOUGH NOT CONFIRMED, TO BE A FRONT FOR THE LTTE - </p><p>CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR A BOMB PLACED AT </p><p>KATUNAYAKE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WHICH EXPLODED BUT </p><p>DID CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES OR DAMAGE.  THE ELLALAN </p><p>FORCE ALSO SENT SEVERAL LETTERS TO NEWS AGENCIES AND </p><p>FOREIGN MISSIONS WARNING TOURISTS AND FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTORS TO STAY AWAY FROM SRI LANKA OR FACE SEVERE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES.  HOWEVER, THROUGH NOVEMBER, NO ACTION </p><p>OF THE ELLALAN FORCE HAS KNOWN TO HAVE CAUSED INJURY </p><p>TO PERSONS OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY. </p><p> </p><p>BOARDMAN </p><p></p></div>
