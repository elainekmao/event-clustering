<p>UNCLAS ROME 002727 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM USMISSION ROME </p><p> </p><p>LUANDA FOR USAID RHELLYER AND HEVANS </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA FOR NANCE KYLOH </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR KFULLER AND KDEBLAUW </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p>USUN FOR LSHESTACK </p><p>NAIROBI FOR ARO AND FFP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, AORC, PREF, WFP, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: WFP LOGISTICS-MOVING FOOD AND NON-FOOD ITEMS IN </p><p>ANGOLA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) ROME 2065  B) 2711 </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  SENIOR EMERGENCY COORDINATOR IN THE U.S. MISSION IN </p><p>ROME TO THE U.N. AGENCIES TRAVELED TO ANGOLA APRIL 13-- </p><p>20 TO REVIEW THE OPERATIONS OF THE U.N. WORLD FOOD </p><p>PROGRAM (WFP) AND THE EMERGENCY COORDINATION UNIT OF THE </p><p>FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION OF THE U.N. </p><p>(FAO/ECU), AS WELL AS TO LOOK AT THE COMPLEMENTARITY </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO.  WFP\'S PROGRAMS AND FAO/ECU ACTIVITIES </p><p>WERE REPORTED IN REF TELS.  THIS REPORT FOCUSES SOLELY </p><p>ON WFP LOGISTICS ACTIVITIES. </p><p></p><p>2.  IN THE PAST FIVE MONTHS, WFP WAS ABLE TO INCREASE </p><p>THE PERCENTAGE OF ROAD TRANSPORT VERSUS AIR FOR MOVING </p><p>ITS FOOD COMMODITIES.  WFP IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A </p><p>REVIEW OF ITS LAND TRANSPORT RATES, IN THE HOPES THAT </p><p>THEY WILL DECREASE IN THE POST-WAR ENVIRONMENT.  FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING, WFP CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN ITS SECURITY </p><p>SAFEGUARDS FOR ROAD AND AIR TRANSPORT.  THE POOR </p><p>CONDITION OF SOME AIRSTRIPS CONTINUES TO HAMPER WFP\'S </p><p>OPERATIONS AND BE A SAFETY CONCERN.  WFP IS MAKING </p><p>CONTINUAL STRIDES TO TIGHTEN AND STRENGTHEN ITS TWO </p><p>SPECIAL OPERATIONS:  THE AIR PASSENGER SERVICE AND THE </p><p>AIRLIFT OF NON-FOOD ITEMS.  SUCH SERVICES ARE CRITICAL </p><p>TO THE OVERALL HUMANITARIAN EFFORT IN ANGOLA AND MERIT </p><p>CONTINUED USG SUPPORT.  SEE PARA 18 FOR RECOMMENDATIONS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>AIR VERSUS ROAD </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE SEC MET WITH WFP\'S LOGISTICS CHIEF, CHRIS NIKOI, </p><p>TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENT CHALLENGES </p><p>FACING WFP\'S OPERATIONS.  WFP\'S LOGISTICS UNIT ARRANGES </p><p>FOR AND OVERSEES THE MOVEMENT OF ITS FOOD COMMODITIES BY </p><p>ROAD AND AIR, AND ALSO RUNS TWO SPECIAL OPERATIONS </p><p>(SOS), NAMELY THE PASSENGER AIR SERVICE AND THE AIRLIFT </p><p>OF NON-FOOD ITEMS (NFIS) FOR THE HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN 2001, THE RATIO OF AIR TO ROAD TRANSPORT WAS 60 </p><p>PERCENT AIR AND 40 PERCENT ROAD.  SINCE JANUARY OF THIS </p><p>YEAR, WFP WAS ABLE TO INCREASE ROAD TRANSPORT BY ABOUT </p><p>13 PERCENT, SO THAT THE RATIO HAS IMPROVED TO 47 PERCENT </p><p>AIR AND 53 PERCENT ROAD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  GIVEN THE NEW OPERATIONAL SCENARIO IN-COUNTRY, I.E., </p><p>NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ROAD TRANSPORTATION, NEWLY </p><p>ACCESSIBLE AREAS IN NEED OF HUMANITARIAN AID, THE </p><p>POSSIBLE RETURN OF REFUGEES, AND THE NEED FOR FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO FAMILIES OF EX-UNITA COMBATANTS, WFP\'S </p><p>TRANSPORT CHALLENGES MAY INCREASE ALONGSIDE THE </p><p>PROGRAMMATIC CHALLENGES AS REPORTED IN REF TEL A. </p><p>NONETHELESS, WFP RE-TENDERED THE CONTRACTS FOR ROAD </p><p>TRANSPORT IN THE LAST PART OF MAY TO SURVEY THE </p><p>TRANSPORT MARKET IN THE CHANGED ENVIRONMENT.  IN TANDEM, </p><p>WFP IS CONDUCTING A LAND, TRANSPORT, SHIPPING AND </p><p>HANDLING (LTSH) REVIEW TO SEE IF THERE ARE CORRIDORS </p><p>WHERE THE LTSH RATE CAN BE REDUCED.  WFP HOPES THE </p><p>INCREASED POSSIBILITIES FOR ROAD TRANSPORT WOULD RESULT </p><p>IN A REDUCTION IN THE LTSH RATE, NOTWITHSTANDING </p><p>CHALLENGES IMPOSED BY THE VERY POOR STATE OF ROAD </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT AREAS TO BE </p><p>SERVICED HAVE NOW INCREASED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  NOTE:  WITH THE NUMBER OF INCREASED NEEDS AND SITES, </p><p>SOME OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN REMOTE LOCATIONS, IT IS </p><p>FORESEEABLE THAT THE NEED FOR AIR TRANSPORT COULD </p><p>INCREASE IN THE SHORT TERM.  THE POTENTIAL FOR BANDITRY </p><p>IS ALSO A VALID CONCERN.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>LINGERING SECURITY PRECAUTIONS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT FOR REASONS OF SECURITY, THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTERS CONTINUE TO USE ARMED FORCES OF </p><p>ANGOLA (FAA) ESCORTS FOR SOME CORRIDORS.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>WFP PLANES CONTINUE TO SPIRAL INTO THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>CAPITALS WHEN ARRIVING AND DEPARTING.  WFP PLANS TO </p><p>MAINTAIN THESE SAFETY PRACTICES FOR THE FORESEEABLE </p><p>FUTURE, BUT HAS BEGUN INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF REVISING THESE SAFETY OPERATIONAL </p><p>PROCEDURES. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>AIRSTRIPS-THE PERENNIAL PROBLEM </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE POOR CONDITION OF MANY OF THE AIRSTRIPS HAS BEEN </p><p>A MATTER OF PERPETUAL DIALOGUE IN ANGOLA.  DURING THE </p><p>SEC\'S VISIT, WFP HAD JUST RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PUBLIC WORKS THAT OUTLINED A SCHEDULE FOR </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF THE KUITO AIRSTRIP, WHEREBY THE AIRSTRIP </p><p>WILL BE OPEN FOR 10 DAYS FOR FLIGHTS AND THEN CLOSED FOR </p><p>TWO WEEKS OF MAINTENANCE.  THE MINISTRY INTENDS TO </p><p>CONTINUE THIS SCHEDULE FOR THE COMING MONTHS.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS IS A VERY WELCOME GESTURE FROM THE MINISTRY, AS THE </p><p>APPALLING CONDITION OF THE KUITO AIRSTRIP HAS BEEN A </p><p>MATTER OF MANY DEBATES OVER THE PAST YEARS.  LET\'S HOPE </p><p>THE GRA\'S INTENTIONS ARE GENUINE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE LOGISTICS CHIEF VOICED A SIMILAR CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>THE LUENA AIRSTRIP, AS IT ALSO REQUIRES MAINTENANCE. </p><p>THE TONNAGE NEEDS IN LUENA ARE SO HIGH, SHUTTING DOWN </p><p>THE AIRSTRIP FOR EVEN A FEW DAYS COULD HAVE A </p><p>DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE STATUS OF THE BENEFICIARIES. </p><p>THUS, REGULAR MAINTENANCE IS NECESSARY, BUT THE AIRSTRIP </p><p>CANNOT BE CLOSED FOR SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE DAYS.  WFP IS </p><p>FLYING TWO TO THREE FLIGHTS A DAY, FIVE TO SIX DAYS A </p><p>WEEK INTO LUENA AS IT IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE BY AIR.  DUE TO </p><p>THE PHYSICAL DISTANCE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN LUENA AND A </p><p>PORT, WFP CANNOT BEGIN ROAD DELIVERIES INTO LUENA UNTIL </p><p>SEVERAL BRIDGES IN SEVERAL PROVINCES ARE REPAIRED.  THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REPAIR OF THE BRIDGES BELONGS TO </p><p>THE GRA. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WHERE POSSIBLE, WFP TRIES TO KEEP A BUFFER STOCK OF </p><p>TWO WEEKS IN THE PROVINCES TO PROVIDE FOR UNFORESEEN </p><p>CLOSURES OF THE AIRSTRIPS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>SPECIAL OPERATIONS:  AIR PASSENGER SERVICE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  UNDER THIS SO, WFP RUNS FOUR KING AIR AND ONE </p><p>CARAVAN AIRCRAFT.  THIS IS A SERVICE THAT WFP HAS </p><p>MANAGED FOR MANY YEARS IN ANGOLA, AND HAS BEEN FUNDED </p><p>CONSISTENTLY BY USAID/DCHA/OFDA. </p><p> </p><p>12.  NIKOI EXPLAINED THAT HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO BE MORE </p><p>AGGRESSIVE ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO FLY ON THE </p><p>PLANE ARE INDEED LEGITIMATE PASSENGERS, I.E. FROM THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY.  HE HAS ASKED NGOS, EMBASSIES, </p><p>AND U.N. AGENCIES TO SUBMIT POSSIBLE NAMES OF TRAVELERS, </p><p>THAT THEN CAN BE CROSS-CHECKED WITH SUBMITTED NAMES FOR </p><p>EACH SCHEDULED FLIGHT.  IN ADDITION, WFP IS CONSIDERING </p><p>A "NO-SHOW" POLICY, WHEREBY AN ORGANIZATION IS PENALIZED </p><p>FOR RESERVING A SEAT, BUT NOT SHOWING UP FOR THE FLIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  FOLLOWING THE VISIT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CIVILIAN </p><p>AVIATION ORGANIZATION (ICAO) LAST YEAR, WFP HAS REMOVED </p><p>FROM ITS ROSTER SOME AIR OPERATORS THAT DID NOT PASS </p><p>ACCREDITATION.  ONCE THE OPERATORS CAN PROVE THAT THE </p><p>NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS FOR ACCREDITATION HAVE BEEN MADE, </p><p>THEY WILL BE REINSTATED TO WFP\'S LIST. </p><p> </p><p>14.  COMMENT:  IN LATE 1999 AFTER THE CRASH OF THE WFP </p><p>PLANE IN KOSOVO, THE U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL REQUESTED </p><p>ICAO TO REVIEW THE AIR OPERATIONS (OPS) OF ALL U.N. </p><p>AGENCIES.  ICAO BEGAN ITS REVIEW OF WFP AIR OPS IN THE </p><p>FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000, AND SINCE THEN, WFP HAS MADE </p><p>TREMENDOUS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ITS SAFETY AND OPERATING </p><p>PROCEDURES IN ALL ITS AIR OPS WORLDWIDE.  WFP/ANGOLA\'S </p><p>EFFORTS OUTLINED ABOVE ARE PROOF OF ITS CONTINUING </p><p>STRIDES TO IMPROVE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>SPECIAL OPERATIONS:  AIR TRANSPORT OF NON-FOOD ITEMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  THIS SO BEGAN IN 1997 BUT HAS SUFFERED FROM </p><p>CONTINUED FUNDING PROBLEMS.  IT IS ALSO A RATHER </p><p>COMPLICATED OPERATION.  NGOS AND UN AGENCIES SUBMIT </p><p>REQUESTS TO WFP TO AIRLIFT A PARTICULAR QUANTITY OF NFIS </p><p>TO ONE OR MORE LOCATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THEIR OPERATIONS. </p><p>AS ONE NGO\'S OR UN AGENCY\'S GOODS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO </p><p>FILL A PLANE (17 TONS), WFP CONSOLIDATES THE REQUESTS IN </p><p>ORDER TO SEND FULL PLANE LOADS TO A DESTINATION. IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE NFIS MUST BE PRIORITIZED, AND SOMETIMES </p><p>PRIORITIES CHANGE WITH THE SEASON WHICH AFFECTS THE </p><p>TIMING OF THE TRANSPORT. </p><p> </p><p>16.  WFP DOES NOT LIKE TO TRANSPORT NFIS ON THE SAME </p><p>PLANE AS THE FOOD FOR TWO REASONS:  1) DOING SO SLOWS </p><p>DOWN THE TURN-AROUND TIME FOR THE PLANES IN LOADING AND </p><p>UNLOADING FOOD AND 2) DELIVERY OF NFIS TO THE AIRPORT BY </p><p>NGOS TENDS TO BE UNRELIABLE AND THEREFORE CREATES </p><p>OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS IF SCHEDULED WITH FOOD FLIGHTS. </p><p>GENERALLY, NFI FLIGHTS ARE SCHEDULED ON SATURDAYS, </p><p>EXCEPT WHEN THE ITEMS ARE OF AN EMERGENCY NATURE. </p><p> </p><p>17.  SEVERAL NGOS, AS WELL AS THE FAO/ECU, EXPRESSED </p><p>FRUSTRATION TO THE SEC REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF THE </p><p>WFP PLANE FOR NFI TRANSPORT.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS </p><p>THE CRITICISMS AND FRUSTRATION, NIKOI WANTS TO ARRANGE </p><p>QUARTERLY PRIORITIZATION MEETINGS WHERE IT IS DECIDED </p><p>WHAT ITEMS WOULD BE THE PRIORITY FOR THE UPCOMING THREE </p><p>MONTHS.  THIS WOULD HELP TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF </p><p>DISGRUNTLEMENT.  WFP ALSO IS TRYING TO COMMISSION A </p><p>SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR TRACKING NFIS, SO THAT </p><p>COMMUNICATION REGARDING THE POTENTIAL MOVEMENT AND PAST </p><p>MOVEMENTS OF NFIS IMPROVES BETWEEN THE REQUESTING BODY </p><p>AND WFP. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>18.  RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-  THE USG SHOULD SUPPORT WFP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN ITS </p><p>QUEST TO GET THE GRA TO REPAIR CRITICAL TRANSPORTATION </p><p>LINKS IN THE PROVINCES, MOST NOTABLY AIRSTRIPS AND </p><p>BRIDGES. </p><p></p><p>-  IT IS SUGGESTED THAT USAID/DCHA/OFDA CONTINUE ITS </p><p>SUPPORT OF BOTH WFP SPECIAL OPERATIONS, AS THEY ARE </p><p>PLAYING A CRITICAL ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE ENTIRE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EFFORT, AND WILL BE NEEDED FOR SOME TIME </p><p>YET.
