<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, IO/T, NEA/IAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  2-11-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AORC, EAID, SNAR, CE, TH, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  Colombo Plan:  Consensus emerging on </p><p>Thai candidate for secretary general slot </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 2/10/03 class e-mail </p><p> </p><p>-     (B) New Delhi 797 </p><p>-     (C) Colombo-SA/INS 1/24/03 fax </p><p>-     (D) Bangkok 382 </p><p>-     (E) USMission New York 101  (All Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an Action Request -- Please see Para 4. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Poloff attended a February 11 Colombo Plan </p><p>meeting focused on selecting a new secretary general of </p><p>the organization.  (Note:  The new secretary general, </p><p>who will serve a four-year term, will take over in June </p><p>from the current incumbent, an Indian.)  During the </p><p>course of the meeting, members decided that Kittipan </p><p>Kanjanapipatkul, the candidate proposed by the Thai </p><p>government, should be interviewed for the spot.  (Note: </p><p>Per Ref D, the Thai government has requested our support </p><p>for its candidate.  Kanjanapipatkul is a Thai government </p><p>official, who has done significant work with the Colombo </p><p>Plan in the past.  His c.v. is included in Ref C.) </p><p>Poloff did not join in this decision, pending Washington </p><p>instructions.  Members (again, other than the U.S.) </p><p>agreed that the Iranian candidate, Nasrollah Kazemi </p><p>Kamyab, should also be invited in for an interview. </p><p>(Note:  Mission just received Kamyab\'s c.v., which it is </p><p>faxing to Washington.  He has ambassador-ranking and </p><p>represents Iran at ECOSOC at the UN.)  Other than the </p><p>Thai and the Iranian, none of the other candidates (from </p><p>Bhutan, India, Mongolia, two from Pakistan, and Sri </p><p>Lanka) was invited for interviews.  (Note:  Although </p><p>Burma clearly indicated support for the Thai candidate, </p><p>it also recommended reviewing the Bhutanese candidate -- </p><p>also see Ref B.  No one else spoke on behalf of Bhutan\'s </p><p>candidate.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Thai candidate seems to have by far the most </p><p>support.  Indeed, a consensus seems to be developing </p><p>around his candidacy.  It was not clear why the Iranian </p><p>candidate was thrown in the mix, with only Malaysia and </p><p>Australia recommending him (and both these members </p><p>actually seem to support the Thai candidate).  The next </p><p>selection meeting is scheduled for March 6, with the </p><p>Thai and Iranian nominees scheduled to attend and be </p><p>interviewed by members.  Based on what we understand, </p><p>the Korean chair of the Colombo Plan may propose as </p><p>early as that day that members vote for a candidate. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ACTION REQUEST:  Mission requests guidance on </p><p>whether we should join the emerging consensus and </p><p>support Thailand\'s nominee, Kittipan Kanjanapipatkul, as </p><p>Secretary General of the Colombo Plan.  Mission requests </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Washington\'s guidance before the Colombo Plan meeting on </p><p>March 6, where members may well be asked to vote. </p><p>Mission also requests whether it should participate in </p><p>the planned interview of the Iranian candidate that day </p><p>or sit it out.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
