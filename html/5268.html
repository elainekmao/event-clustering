<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000541 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU, GG, RS </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS IN NO HURRY TO PUSH FOR MESKHETIAN </p><p>RESETTLEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by PolCouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: Turkish MFA officials consider resettlement </p><p>to Georgia the best long-term solution to the Meskhetian </p><p>issue.  Aware of Georgia\'s delicate domestic political </p><p>situation, however, they are reluctant to pressure Tblisi and </p><p>prefer to work through the Council of Europe.  Meanwhile, in </p><p>the short-term, MFA will continue to lobby Moscow to grant </p><p>citizenship rights to Krasnodar Meskhetians.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In recent meetings, MFA officials told us that the GOT </p><p>is not pushing hard for resettlement of Meskhetians in </p><p>Georgia or elsewhere.  MFA Caucasus officer Yonca Ozceri </p><p>explained to us Jan. 17 that although the GOT has raised the </p><p>issue directly with Georgia, MFA prefers to use international </p><p>organizations -- such as the Council of Europe (CoE) -- to </p><p>discuss the Meskhetians.  According to Ozceri, the CoE has </p><p>set a deadline of 2012 for Georgia to take the necessary </p><p>measures to ensure the resettlement of Meskhetians.  Ozceri </p><p>said that because Ankara understands the difficult political </p><p>environment in Georgia, GOT would prefer to let the CoE </p><p>process play out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ozceri averred that, ultimately, resettlement in an </p><p>area along the Turkey-Georgia border is the best solution for </p><p>the Meskhetians, but there are several obstacles that will </p><p>complicate the effort.  First, according to Ozceri, the </p><p>Meskhetian homeland is now heavily populated (80%) by </p><p>Armenians who are unlikely to welcome the return of </p><p>Meskhetians.  Second, some local politicians in the region </p><p>are using the Meskhetians and other groups as a political </p><p>issue to drum up anti-immigrant sentiment.  Third, Georgia is </p><p>likely have difficulty funding resettlement.  Finally, </p><p>Georgian legislation up to this point requires Meskhetians to </p><p>prove their ancestry and ties to the region, which is "simply </p><p>too much to ask."  Ozceri claimed there have been no </p><p>discussions in the GOT about resettling Meskhetians in Turkey </p><p>or a third country such as the U.S. but allowed that the </p><p>latter option wouldn\'t be a problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While MFA awaits the outcome of the CoE process, it is </p><p>also working quietly with the Russians to improve the </p><p>situation of Meskhetians in the Krasnodar region.  MFA Russia </p><p>officer Ozlem Ergun told us Jan. 13 that, after meeting with </p><p>Meskhetians in Krasnodar, MFA raised their plight with </p><p>Moscow.  MFA efforts are currently focused on overcoming </p><p>Russian domestic political resistance to granting citizenship </p><p>rights for Meskhetians in Krasnodar.  Meskhetians elsewhere </p><p>in Russia "have no problem" obtaining citizenship, but local </p><p>politicians in Krasnodar continue to dissemble.  According to </p><p>Ergun, there have been some efforts at the federal level to </p><p>resolve the impasse but nothing substantive has changed in </p><p>recent months. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
