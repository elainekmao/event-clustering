<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 THE HAGUE 001806 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KAWC, KJUS, ICTY, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: ICC: A CAUTIOUS BEGINNING WITH MIXED SIGNALS FROM </p><p>THE PROSECUTOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 THE HAGUE 3524 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Legal Counselor Clifton M. Johnson per reasons 1.5(b) an </p><p>d (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Public documents of the International </p><p>Criminal Court (ICC) and conversations with diplomats from </p><p>friendly states parties to the Rome Statute and other members </p><p>of The Hague international law community have given Embassy </p><p>legal officers an early glimpse into the formative activities </p><p>at ICC headquarters.  Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo and </p><p>his key staffers are working to develop principles, rules and </p><p>regulations to guide their selection of the first preliminary </p><p>examinations and investigations while at the same time </p><p>culling through over 400 submissions alleging potential </p><p>crimes for the ICC to pursue.  Ocampo has signaled his </p><p>interest in examining potential crimes in Congo and Colombia. </p><p> Less clear are his views on Iraq.  While he has spoken of </p><p>alleged crimes involving British forces in Iraq in </p><p>semi-public briefings, his private comments indicate that </p><p>such cases would be highly unlikely candidates for ICC </p><p>investigations.  Meanwhile, in late June, the ICC ended the </p><p>phase of leadership head-hunting when ICC judges selected </p><p>Bruno Cathala of France as the organization\'s first </p><p>Registrar.  With leadership figures now in place in all three </p><p>branches of the court, the next key event is Ocampo\'s press </p><p>briefing on July 16 where he will provide an overview of </p><p>"information received by the Office of the Prosecutor </p><p>regarding potential situations under the jurisdiction of the </p><p>Court."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>The Prosecutor Promises Restraint and Focus . . . </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo faces three </p><p>major tasks at this time -- setting out his office\'s </p><p>investigative and prosecutorial policies and principles, </p><p>organizing the office itself, and reviewing incoming </p><p>information concerning potential crimes.  Ocampo\'s early </p><p>thoughts on prosecutorial policy may be found in a draft </p><p>policy paper OTP published on the ICC website in advance of a </p><p>June 17-18 OTP "public seminar" (see </p><p>www.icc-cpi.int/otp/policy.php).  OTP seems to be making an </p><p>effort to cool the passions and lower the expectations of ICC </p><p>activists who want the prosecutor to issue ambitious </p><p>indictments soon.  Three aspects of the paper in particular </p><p>give an early view into how Ocampo intends to manage his </p><p>investigative responsibilities. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) First, the paper emphasizes the constraints on ICC </p><p>action much more than the opportunities for investigations </p><p>and prosecutions.  Echoing the new Registrar\'s views (see </p><p>paras 11-13 below), it emphasizes "the logistical constraints </p><p>that will limit the practical scope of action of the Court" </p><p>and argues for "a project-oriented as opposed to a static </p><p>organisation model" for the court.  Its emphasis on resource </p><p>constraints is matched by a stated commitment to </p><p>complementarity -- the principle that national jurisdictions </p><p>have primacy over the ICC and that the ICC merely complements </p><p>national systems.  It makes a restrained, if rhetorical, </p><p>claim that the ICC\'s success should be measured "by the </p><p>absence of trials by the ICC as a consequence of the </p><p>effective functioning of national systems."  Such rhetoric, </p><p>we have heard from close observers of the ICC, has strongly </p><p>irritated leading ICC supporters in the non-governmental </p><p>organization (NGO) community. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) With respect to complementarity, OTP takes an initial </p><p>stab at evaluating the content of the Rome Statute\'s </p><p>provision for determining that the ICC may take jurisdiction </p><p>over a situation if an otherwise responsible state would be </p><p>"unwilling or unable" to exercise its jurisdiction.  It </p><p>suggests that the prosecutor will need to take a hard look at </p><p>such situations before proceeding to investigations.  The </p><p>paper emphasizes that "States remain responsible and </p><p>accountable for investigating and prosecuting crimes </p><p>committed under their jurisdiction and that national systems </p><p>are expected to maintain and enforce adherence to </p><p>international standards."  Indeed, the prosecutor seems eager </p><p>to use his position as much to "help State authorities to </p><p>fulfill their duty to investigate and prosecute at the </p><p>national level" as to investigate and prosecute crimes </p><p>himself. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Second, the OTP is clearly heading toward a policy -- </p><p>similar to that of the International Criminal Tribunal for </p><p>the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) -- of focusing its investigative </p><p>and prosecutorial energies on senior-level perpetrators of </p><p>crimes within its jurisdiction.  Here the OTP appears to be </p><p>taking a narrower approach than the Rome Statute, which </p><p>refers to "the most serious crimes of concern" to the </p><p>international community, by focusing on only the most senior </p><p>alleged perpetrators of such crimes.  The OTP argues that </p><p>"(t)he concept of gravity should not be exclusively attached </p><p>to the act that constituted the crime but also to the degree </p><p>of participation in its commission."  The OTP policy paper </p><p>concludes that the OTP should therefore "focus its </p><p>investigative and prosecutorial efforts and resources on </p><p>those who bear the greatest responsibility, such as the </p><p>leaders of the State or organization allegedly responsible </p><p>for those crimes."  Embassy legal officers have learned from </p><p>some participants at the June 17-18 OTP seminar that this </p><p>aspect of the paper caused the greatest consternation among </p><p>the NGO community, which decried the emergence of a so-called </p><p>"impunity gap," in which senior levels get prosecuted but </p><p>lower-level criminals escape prosecution.  OTP anticipated </p><p>that charge by stating, in its paper, that "less grave cases" </p><p>should be returned to national jurisdictions for prosecution </p><p>-- again, a further echo of the ICTY and its "completion </p><p>strategy". </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Finally, the OTP does not fully suggest how it will </p><p>evaluate information that NGOs and individuals are </p><p>increasingly submitting as evidence of war crimes, crimes </p><p>against humanity or genocide.  Embassy contacts have noted </p><p>that the prosecutor seems obligated to evaluate incoming </p><p>information, whatever its source, pointing to the provision </p><p>of Article 15(2) of the Rome Statute that the "Prosecutor </p><p>shall analyse the seriousness of the information received." </p><p>The paper emphasizes that OTP\'s Analysis Section "must be </p><p>strengthened" so that it can undertake "focused and </p><p>effective" preliminary examinations of incoming information. </p><p>The OTP especially wants to develop analytic capabilities to </p><p>identify "complex patterns of criminal conduct" and the </p><p>presence of elements of alleged crimes.  Again, the paper </p><p>returns to the theme of resource limitations, noting the </p><p>OTP\'s interest in "cost-effective" investigations. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) A set of "draft regulations" designed to guide OTP\'s </p><p>investigative and prosecutorial activities gives some insight </p><p>into how it will evaluate whether information provides a </p><p>sufficient basis for an investigation.  For instance, the </p><p>draft section on preliminary examinations would guide the </p><p>office from the initial collection of communications </p><p>submitted to the OTP, to its "assessment of the credibility </p><p>and reliability of the sources of information" and the </p><p>preparation of a "preliminary examination report" and "draft </p><p>investigation plan."  The ultimate aim in this respect would </p><p>be a recommendation from the deputy prosecutors for </p><p>investigations and prosecutions to the chief prosecutor as to </p><p>whether OTP should seek authorization from a pre-trial </p><p>chamber to conduct an investigation.  A draft investigation </p><p>plan would assess such items as the reasonableness of belief </p><p>that a crime within the ICC\'s jurisdiction took place; the </p><p>role of likely suspects and aims of an investigation; whether </p><p>a case would meet the complementarity standards of the </p><p>Statute; a discussion of required resources for an </p><p>investigation; and other matters.  The full text of the </p><p>regulations may be found at </p><p>www.icc-cip.int/otp/draft regulations. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) At the organizational level, the OTP deputy slots </p><p>remain to be filled (perhaps by a decision of the Assembly of </p><p>States Parties in September), though Ocampo has initiated an </p><p>active hiring program that tracks his focus on policies and </p><p>investigations rather than prosecutions at this stage.  The </p><p>institution remains small, and OTP is looking to hire </p><p>mid-level investigators and lawyers to guide preliminary </p><p>examinations of incoming information as well as lawyers with </p><p>background in public international criminal law.  He has </p><p>hired as his chief of staff and head of the OTP\'s </p><p>"complementarity unit" Argentine diplomat and lawyer Sylvia </p><p>Fernandez.  Fernandez has extensive experience with the ICC, </p><p>having served as a senior negotiator for Argentina at Rome </p><p>and as head of the working group looking at the definition of </p><p>aggression in the ICC Preparatory Commission.  A UK colleague </p><p>indicated that she is considered a reliable and serious </p><p>person who is rated very highly by FCO lawyers.  The </p><p>experience of some USG delegates to the ICC Rome Conference </p><p>is less positive and some credit her with the drafting of </p><p>various anti-U.S. provisions in the statute.  We expect that </p><p>Fernandez\' role and influence will become clearer over time. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>. . . But Is Ocampo Ready For Prime Time? </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>9. (C) While Ocampo seems to be moving the OTP in a careful </p><p>direction with his draft policy paper, his public statements </p><p>reveal a prosecutor who has not yet mastered his public role. </p><p> Ocampo will be further tested and subject to public scrutiny </p><p>when he describes in a July 16 press conference the over 400 </p><p>submissions received by the OTP thus far, of which over 100 </p><p>are said to be Iraq-related.  In semi-private forums and in </p><p>private conversations reported to Embassy legal officers, </p><p>Ocampo has indicated consistently that his initial </p><p>investigative interests will focus not on Iraq but on the </p><p>situation in the Congo, including the potential involvement </p><p>of Belgians with financial interests in the diamond industry, </p><p>and Colombia.  In public, however, Ocampo has been less </p><p>restrained.  At a recent presentation before a group of ICTY </p><p>staff and students participating in a Humanity in Action </p><p>summer course, Ocampo said that he was looking at the actions </p><p>of British forces in Iraq -- which, according to one Embassy </p><p>source, led a British ICTY prosecutor nearly to fall off his </p><p>chair.  It was, another participant said, "a complete </p><p>shocker" and came without any qualifications.  Such </p><p>statements may contain less than meets the eye.  Privately, </p><p>Ocampo has said that he wishes to dispose of Iraq issues </p><p>(i.e., not investigate them), much in line with what </p><p>Registrar Cathala is urging (see para 13 below).  In </p><p>addition, some observers of Ocampo believe he has adopted too </p><p>much of an academic approach -- raising situations such as </p><p>Iraq not to signal areas he wishes to investigate but to </p><p>illustrate the limits of the ICC\'s jurisdiction (i.e., that </p><p>jurisdiction may extend to UK but not U.S. personnel). </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Embassy interlocutors have also suggested that </p><p>Ocampo\'s public remarks may be directed at fending off a wave </p><p>of dissatisfaction among the NGO community about his draft </p><p>policy paper.  According to this reasoning, Ocampo wants to </p><p>bring attention to the complaints he has received so as to </p><p>prompt governments to conduct their own investigations and </p><p>thereby provide a basis for removing these cases from ICC </p><p>review under the complementarity provision.  A colleague at </p><p>the UK Embassy, who was aware of Ocampo\'s remarks concerning </p><p>the UK, said London was not particularly concerned because </p><p>any information about UK war crimes, if assessed reliable, </p><p>would be the subject of investigation by relevant UK </p><p>authorities and, ultimately, not be subject to ICC </p><p>investigation.  Some Embassy contacts also suggest that </p><p>Ocampo\'s mediocre English skills may give his public remarks </p><p>a less nuanced and more glib tenor than intended. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>A Cautious French Administrator for the ICC </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) On June 24, the ICC\'s 18 judges selected as Registrar </p><p>France\'s Bruno Cathala -- a pragmatist who impressed Embassy </p><p>legal officers in his former function as deputy registrar of </p><p>the ICTY.  Cathala has been the de facto Registrar since the </p><p>fall, when the Assembly of States Parties drew him away from </p><p>the ICTY in order to be the ICC\'s Director of Common </p><p>Services, or chief administrator.  (Note: His selection </p><p>disappointed the Dutch Government, which had expected, as is </p><p>the tradition with many international legal institutions in </p><p>the Hague, that the position would go to the Dutch candidate. </p><p> End note.)  A lawyer and civil law judge by training, </p><p>Cathala has long experience in court and organizational </p><p>management.  The Embassy\'s experience with Cathala as deputy </p><p>registrar of the ICTY is solidly positive; he was a leading </p><p>force behind the emergence of the completion strategy and a </p><p>constant thorn in the sides of ICTY judges and prosecutors, </p><p>whom he pressed daily to stick to ICTY efficiency and </p><p>completion strategy benchmarks.  He regularly made himself </p><p>available to Embassy officers to discuss ICTY issues, and in </p><p>our periodic contact with him since his departure from the </p><p>ICTY, has emphasized his interest in seeing the ICC develop </p><p>in a decentralized, flexible, measured, and narrowly focused </p><p>way.  See reftel. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Sensitive to the ICC\'s resource limitations, Cathala </p><p>believes that the ICC cannot seek to try all war criminals </p><p>within the court\'s jurisdiction but needs to focus its </p><p>efforts on those most responsible for such crimes.  It is a </p><p>vision derived from his experience at the ICTY and leads him </p><p>to a different place than many of the ICC\'s strongest </p><p>supporters.  While he will not have influence over the </p><p>prosecutor\'s specific investigative decisions, he will be in </p><p>a position to help steer the ICC in a fiscally responsible </p><p>direction.  An energetic and voluble character, Cathala </p><p>professes to be a proponent of caution within the ICC, and </p><p>his control of the purse will undoubtedly influence the OTP </p><p>and chambers. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Cathala (please protect) told an embassy legal </p><p>officer that he has strongly advised Ocampo to speak very </p><p>carefully in public and to be extraordinarily sensitive to </p><p>the way even strictly accurate statements may be perceived. </p><p>In the face of the media "pushing and pushing" and under the </p><p>watchful eyes of governments, the "first wrong word," Cathala </p><p>said, could easily spell disaster for the court.  It will be </p><p>crucial, he said, for the ICC to dispose easily of "silly </p><p>things like Iraq".  "We\'re not going to run all over the </p><p>world," said Cathala, who added that he personally wants </p><p>relations with the USG to be smooth. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Cathala\'s personal comments to Emboff and Ocampo\'s </p><p>early OTP documents seem designed to put the USG at ease and </p><p>assure us that the court will proceed carefully and not </p><p>launch controversial investigations.  Ocampo\'s public </p><p>statements raise concerns less about what he will investigate </p><p>and prosecute -- as one colleague noted to us, the prosecutor </p><p>has an obligation not merely to throw away complaints but </p><p>must at least dispose of them according to some logic -- than </p><p>about his ability to avoid embroiling the ICC in controversy </p><p>even in the absence of any investigations.  The proof of </p><p>Ocampo\'s abilities and intentions, of course, will be found </p><p>in how he selects and investigates his first targets. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Despite the seeming transparency of the OTP, many </p><p>questions are likely to remain unanswered until the first </p><p>investigations are announced.  For instance, how will the OTP </p><p>sift through its growing in-box, some submissions no doubt </p><p>legitimate but many more politically motivated and useless </p><p>for the purpose of investigations?  How in practice will the </p><p>prosecutor determine when a State is "unwilling or unable" to </p><p>exercise jurisdiction over an alleged crime?  Will the </p><p>prosecutor undertake preliminary investigations even before </p><p>determining whether a State is "unable or unwilling" to do so </p><p>itself?  What specific crimes will be of the most interest to </p><p>the OTP, and how high up the chain of command will the </p><p>prosecutor select his investigative targets?  With Ocampo </p><p>beginning to sift through investigation submissions and new </p><p>staff coming on board, the coming months should demonstrate </p><p>more clearly whether the ICC and its leadership have the </p><p>temperament to pursue and sustain a cautious course. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
