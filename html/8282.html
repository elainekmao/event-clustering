<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 002326 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, IT, NATO, ESDP </p><p>SUBJECT: OPPORTUNITY FOR "UPSTREAM" COORDINATION WITH EU ON </p><p>STRATEGIC CONCEPT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ROME 2299 B) BRUSSELS 2727 C) BRUSSELS 2677 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE EMIL SKODON.  REASON: 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUGGESTED ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 4. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DURING THEIR MAY 20 MEETING (REFTEL A REPORTS BULK </p><p>OF CONVERSATION),  MFA DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION </p><p>ROCCO CANGELOSI TOLD PDAS RIES THAT FM FRATTINI PLAYED A KEY </p><p>ROLE IN THE EU\'S SUCCESSFUL "RECONSTRUCTING"  OF THE GANG OF </p><p>FOUR SECURITY INITIATIVE, PULLING IT BACK TO 25 AND CHARGING </p><p>SOLANA WITH DRAFTING AN EU STRATEGIC CONCEPT.   CLAUDIO </p><p>BISOGNIERO, DEPUTY TO POLDIR ARAGONA, ADDED THAT SOLANA WILL </p><p>BE WORKING WITHIN CERTAIN PARAMETERS ON THE DOCUMENT, </p><p>INSISTED UPON BY KEY MEMBER STATES, INCLUDING ITALY.  THE </p><p>CONCEPT MUST BE APPROVED AT 25, EVEN THOUGH SOME MIGHT NOT BE </p><p>IN A POSITION TO MEET THE TESTS IMMEDIATELY.  MOST </p><p>IMPORTANTLY, THE PROPOSALS MUST BE COMPLEMENTARY TO, NOT </p><p>COMPETITIVE WITH, NATO.  ITALY WILL NOT SIGN ON TO ANY </p><p>ELEMENT THAT UNDERMINES BERLIN PLUS. FURTHER, ANY INITIATIVES </p><p>MUST BE UNDERTAKEN IN CONSULTATION WITH NATO. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE GOI HAS ALREADY COMMUNICATED TO SOLANA (AS HAS </p><p>THE UK) THAT THE DOCUMENT SHOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT NATO REMAINS </p><p>THE PRIMARY GUARANTOR OF TRANSATLANTIC SECURITY.  ESDP TASKS </p><p>MUST BE IDENTIFIED CLEARLY, AND EUROPE SHOULD DEFINE ITS </p><p>AREAS OF GEOGRAPHIC RESPONSIBILITY BASED ON CAPABILITIES AND </p><p>REQUIRED INTERFACES WITH NATO.  CANGELOSI AGREED TO RIES\' </p><p>SUGGESTION THAT THE EU STRATEGIC CONCEPT COULD GIVE FOCUS TO </p><p>THE JULY 18 POLDIRS\' MEETING, PROVIDING THE BASIS FOR A BROAD </p><p>    DIALOGUE ON TASKS, THREATS, COMPETENCIES AND CAPABILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  AS REPORTED REFTEL A, RIES UNDERLINED WITH HIS </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS THE IMPORTANCE OF "UPSTREAM" COORDINATION AND </p><p>CONSULTATION ON ISSUES IMPORTANT TO BOTH THE US AND EU. </p><p>FOLLOWING UP ON THIS REQUEST, BISOGNIERO INFORMED US ON  MAY </p><p>22 THAT SOLANA WOULD PRESENT A FIRST DRAFT OF THE STRATEGIC </p><p>CONCEPT TO THE COUNCIL JUNE 20/21 IN THESSALONIKI, AND </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO CONSULT ON THE DOCUMENT. </p><p>BY THE TIME IT REACHES THESSALONIKI, THE OUTLINE, IF NOT SOME </p><p>OF THE DETAIL, OF THE PLAN MAY BE HARD TO ADJUST.  BISOGNIERO </p><p>URGED US NOT ONLY TO CONSULT DIRECTLY WITH SOLANA, BUT ALSO </p><p>TO COORDINATE KEY IDEAS WITH LIKE-MINDED EU MEMBERS (UK, </p><p>ITALY, SPAIN, ETC.)  BISOGNIERO ALSO SAID THAT ARAGONA AGREES </p><p>THAT SOLANA\'S PAPER SHOULD BE A FOCUS FOR THE JULY 18 </p><p>POLDIRS\' MEETING, BUT EMPHASIZED THAT THE USG COULD NOT WAIT </p><p>UNTIL THAT MEETING TO GIVE ITS INPUT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  SUGGESTED ACTION.  POST RECOMMENDS THAT WE TAKE </p><p>BISOGNIERO UP ON HIS SUGGESTION.  WE ARE NOT CERTAIN WHEN, OR </p><p>IF, SOLANA WILL PRESENT TO THE MEMBER STATES PRELIMINARY </p><p>DRAFTS OF THE DOCUMENT HE INTENDS TO TABLE IN THESSALONIKI. </p><p>IT MAY BE MORE EFFICIENT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH SOLANA\'S STAFF </p><p>IN BRUSSELS.  POST DEFERS TO DEPARTMENT, USEU AND USNATO ON </p><p>THE BEST WAY FORWARD.  WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH MFA TO SEE </p><p>WHICH ELEMENTS THEY HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED TO SOLANA. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02326 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
