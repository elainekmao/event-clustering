<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000078 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND INL </p><p>BANGKOK FOR NAS </p><p>DEA FOR OF AND OFF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, BM, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: EVALUATION OF THE WA ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PROJECT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 RANGOON 0114 </p><p>     B. UNVIE VIENNA 0285 </p><p>     C. 02 RANGOON 1547 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is an action message.  See paragraph 7. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary: The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has </p><p>invited the USG to participate in the final evaluation of the </p><p>Wa Alternative Development Project.  We have been the prime </p><p>movers behind this project.  If possible, we should plan to </p><p>participate in the evaluation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has invited </p><p>the United States and other major donors to the Wa </p><p>Alternative Development Project to participate (at their own </p><p>expense) in the project\'s final evaluation.  UNODC has </p><p>contracted for two international and one independent Burmese </p><p>experts to conduct the evaluation from March 7 to April 3, </p><p>2003.  Donor experts (one each) would complement that team. </p><p> </p><p>4.  We recommend that the USG accept the invitation.  The </p><p>United States has been the prime donor for the Wa Alternative </p><p>Development Project.  While other donors (Italy, Germany, and </p><p>Japan) have lately stepped in to pick up some of the </p><p>financial burden, the United States has contributed about </p><p>two-thirds of the project\'s $11 million cost over the past </p><p>four years.  Simple prudence dictates that we ensure that </p><p>those funds were well spent. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Secondly, there may be lessons to be learned from the </p><p>project, which appears to have done relatively well in an </p><p>extraordinarily short period, despite the stress induced by </p><p>cuts in donor support in 2001.  Through the end of 2002, the </p><p>project had hit its targets for opium reduction, health, and </p><p>education, and was opening up a new phase (through the </p><p>construction of a Japanese financed canal in the Nam Kar </p><p>basin) that may allow it to entirely close the food deficit </p><p>in the project area.  That is a fairly remarkable performance </p><p>for a project that was executed under extraordinarily </p><p>difficult circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>6. Thirdly, UNODC has proposed extending and expanding its </p><p>alternative development projects in Burma as part of its next </p><p>five year plan, starting in 2004.  That plan calls for </p><p>extending the Wa Alternative Development Project through 2008 </p><p>and expanding its coverage to areas in the Wa territories </p><p>north of Pang Sang and into areas controlled by the Kokang </p><p>Chinese.  Both areas are major centers of opium production </p><p>and operations in them will require a major expansion of </p><p>UNODC\'s budget in Burma.  Before the United States commits </p><p>support for that effort, we should be certain that the </p><p>current approach is both appropriate and effective. </p><p> </p><p>7. Action requested: Designation of a U.S. expert to </p><p>participate in UNODC\'s evaluation of the Wa Alternative </p><p>Development Project from March 7 to April 3, 2003. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
