<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000710 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, PREL, KIRF, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: PROTESTANT CHURCH CAN STAY -- FOR NOW </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) HCMC 520  (B)  HCMC 551 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  The HCMC People\'s Committee has decided that </p><p>an illegally constructed Protestant church in the Thu Thiem area </p><p>of District 2 can remain open as a house of worship, pending </p><p>approval of the required permits.  While city officials made clear </p><p>that they hold both church leaders and local authorities </p><p>responsible for the current impasse, they have nonetheless </p><p>promised to speed necessary approvals to allow the church to build </p><p>a new, legal structure.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Acting Consul General raised the issue of a Protestant </p><p>house church recently constructed without permission in HCMC\'s </p><p>District 2 (reftels) during a meeting with Mr. Nguyen Thanh Tai, </p><p>Vice Chairman of the HCMC People\'s Committee.  Vice Chairman Tai\'s </p><p>portfolio includes religious affairs.  Noting that the new </p><p>church\'s difficulties in obtaining the required permits had been </p><p>publicized in a press release by Compass Direct, A/CG offered the </p><p>Vice Chairman an opportunity to provide his views on the </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Tai seemed immediately aware of the </p><p>controversy surrounding the new structure and took advantage of </p><p>the opportunity to present the "official" version of events to </p><p>avoid "misinformation."  Recounting the recent history of the </p><p>disputed property, he said that people from the local house church </p><p>congregation had originally bought the land under their own names, </p><p>then later claimed they wanted to use it for their "house of </p><p>worship" (this term was used repeatedly, rather than the more </p><p>common Vietnamese word for "church").  That change from a private </p><p>to a public purpose led to the current dispute over land-use </p><p>rights and created delays in the issuance of permits. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Permission to build was also held up pending official </p><p>recognition for the "new" congregation.  (Note:  Pastor Truong Van </p><p>Nganh, leader of the District 2 congregation, is a legally </p><p>recognized pastor with the official Southern Evangelical Church of </p><p>Vietnam (SECV).  It is not clear, however, whether that status </p><p>entitles him automatically to open a legal church in another </p><p>location.  End note.)  A lack of clear communication between the </p><p>parties only exacerbated the problem.  Meanwhile, some members of </p><p>the congregation "took advantage" of the situation to commence the </p><p>unauthorized construction. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Upon learning of the problem, Vice Chairman Tai </p><p>immediately convened a meeting with SECV representatives and local </p><p>authorities from District 2.  (Note:  This would appear to be the </p><p>meeting that was described in the Compass Direct report as an </p><p>appointment with the Committee for Religious Affairs.  End note.) </p><p>He reprimanded Pastor Nganh for setting a bad example and </p><p>chastised him for failing to observe safe building practices at a </p><p>site that was deemed to be "sacred" (the Vice Chairman\'s word) and </p><p>would house many worshippers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Stating up front that the Pastor had broken the law and </p><p>would need to eventually tear down the structure, the Vice </p><p>Chairman laid out additional steps the church could take to build </p><p>a legal structure on the site.  Based on what he called the </p><p>"spiritual need" for a church in the area, however, he gave the </p><p>congregation permission to use the illegal building until they </p><p>received their permit for a new building.  At the same time, he </p><p>blamed the local authorities for delaying the permits and required </p><p>them to sign a document admitting their mistakes.  He then </p><p>directed the relevant authorities to make sure the land was </p><p>properly demarcated and the permits issued. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Pastor Nganh reported to ConGenoffs earlier that he had </p><p>submitted an application for an address for the new church on July </p><p>21.  The local authorities had denied his request on the grounds </p><p>that the construction was illegal.  On July 25, the People\'s </p><p>Committee of District 2 had levied a fine for the illegal </p><p>construction and ordered him to remove the offending structure. </p><p>He was also instructed to withdraw an earlier complaint regarding </p><p>the initial denial of his permit and write a letter seeking </p><p>reexamination of the issues related to his violation.  While </p><p>Pastor Nganh felt compelled to comply with these requirements </p><p>during the meeting, he had subsequently complained to the HCMC </p><p>Committee for Religious Affairs.  He was still awaiting their </p><p>response.  A number of house church pastors associated with the </p><p>project but unaffiliated with the SECV criticized Pastor Nganh for </p><p>his compromise and pledged to hold the line against removing the </p><p>current structure. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment:  At this point, the ball seems to rest firmly </p><p>in the hands of Pastor Nganh and his followers.  Are they willing </p><p>and financially able to remove the old church and build a new one? </p><p>If so, can they overcome "hard-line" elements in the church that </p><p>consider the victory already won and don\'t want to back down? </p><p>While there would still seem to be many questions regarding the </p><p>legal status of the congregation in District 2, the highest levels </p><p>of the city administration have clearly given them the go-ahead to </p><p>carry on religious activities at the site now and in the future if </p><p>they accept the compromise that has been offered. </p><p>WHITE </p><p></p></div>
