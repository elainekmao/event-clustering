(SBU) Director General of the Debt Management Office Mr. </p><p>A.S. Arikawe told Economic Section Chief June 27 that he </p><p>remains pessimistic on prospects for an early resolution of </p><p>USG/GON differences regarding the bilateral debt rescheduling </p><p>agreement required to implement the December 2000 Paris Club </p><p>rescheduling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Arikawe reports that Nigeria continues its </p><p>negotiations with several bilateral creditors, but that the </p><p>GON\'s differences with the U.S. are the most substantive and </p><p>those differences are growing.  In addition to the objections </p><p>mentioned in Refs A and C, Arikawe cited the following as </p><p>"among the major problems": </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a)  The GON disagrees with the interest accrual method, </p><p>asserting that 5 percent per annum compounded daily results </p><p>in greater interest charges than 5 percent per annum </p><p>compounded annually, thus the effective interest rate is not </p><p>as agreed to originally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(b)  The GON would require a rate of 5 percent compounded </p><p>annually, or, as an alternative, USG agreement to use a </p><p>360-day basis year with monthly compounding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(c)  A clarification of and adjustment in the interest rate </p><p>and charges for non-previously scheduled debt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) According to Arikawe, the GON will convene a </p><p>gathering of Nigerian debt experts the week of July 9 to </p><p>give the Debt Management Office\'s proposals "a thorough </p><p>scrub" before they are submitted for approval for </p><p>presentation to the USG.  He now estimates the week of July </p><p>16 as the earliest that we can expect to receive those </p><p>written comments promised at the May 3 Washington meetings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Arikawe further reported that Nigeria\'s Finance </p><p>Minister wrote June 27 to the Paris Club Chairman requesting </p><p>a five-month extension from June 30 to November 30 (vice the </p><p>3-month extension noted in para 6, Ref A) for concluding the </p><p>bilaterals required to implement the December 2000 Paris Club </p><p>rescheduling agreement. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
