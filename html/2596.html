<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREF, PREL, PGOV, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: TIBETANS MARK MARCH 10 WITH PEACEFUL CEREMONY; </p><p>PROTESTERS BEATEN AT CHINESE EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p>REF: 00 KATHMANDU 562 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Michael S. Hoza, Reasons 1.5 (b),(d). </p><p> </p><p>Dalai Lama\'s Portrait Paraded on March 10 </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Authorities in Nepal allowed the Tibetan community to </p><p>mark the forty-third anniversary of the March 10 uprising in </p><p>Tibet with a public ceremony at Kathmandu\'s Bouddha stupa.  A </p><p>full procession paraded the Dalai Lama\'s portrait around the </p><p>square and a school band played the national anthems of both </p><p>Tibet and Nepal.  Press accounts estimate the crowd size at </p><p>2000.  On March 11, the Kathmandu Post, Nepal\'s leading </p><p>English-language daily, led with a photograph captioned: "a </p><p>group of Nepalese and Tibetan people pray in front of </p><p>Bouddhanath Stupa in the capital on Sunday."  (Note:  The </p><p>caption studiously avoided mention of the ceremony\'s </p><p>significance.  Post has faxed a copy of the photo to SA/INS. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Police Briefed, But Not Home Ministry </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On March 9, Police approached Tibetan community </p><p>leaders to ask what they had planned to mark the next day\'s </p><p>anniversary.  (Note:  Over the years area police have become </p><p>intimate with the Tibetan ceremonial calendar; violence </p><p>marred the March 10 event two years ago when fighting broke </p><p>after some in the crowd threw rocks at law enforcement </p><p>officers (Reftel).)  Subsequently, the Tibet Office </p><p>Representative met with and briefed police.  The </p><p>Representative decided not to notify Home Ministry officials </p><p>in advance, however. </p><p> </p><p>Demonstrators Detained, Beaten </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A group of Tibetans were detained and reportedly </p><p>beaten by police after they held a sit-down demonstration in </p><p>front of the Chinese Embassy.  Later in the day, a police van </p><p>drove them around and released them, one by one, at various </p><p>locations around the city.  One member of the group remains </p><p>unaccounted for; the Tibet Office has been attempting to </p><p>locate the man, in his late twenties.  Upon the conclusion of </p><p>the ceremony in Bouddha, the group, waving the Tibetan flag </p><p>and carrying "Free Tibet" banners, traveled by bus to the </p><p>tourist quarter, Thamel.  From there they marched through a </p><p>residential neighborhood - moving unmolested through at least </p><p>one police checkpoint - to the Chinese Embassy, where they </p><p>reportedly sat down in an open space in front of the entrance </p><p>and began chanting slogans.  The small number of police </p><p>stationed at the Embassy did not react, but soon police in a </p><p>van arrived.  After striking some members of the group with </p><p>batons, they loaded them onto the van and took them away. </p><p>The Tibet Office Representive judged that this was an </p><p>impromptu demonstration, neither organized nor sanctioned by </p><p>any of the many Tibetan youth groups operating in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) That the Tibetan community could hold a large public </p><p>ceremony - complete with patriotic songs and the Dalai Lama\'s </p><p>countenance on display - during the ongoing state of </p><p>emergency seems to validate comments by the Prime Minister </p><p>and others that the emergency is targeted at the Maoists, and </p><p>not the rights of Nepalis.  Granted, the Tibetan community </p><p>leaders were careful not to push too hard, and ordered that </p><p>Tibetan flags and incendiary political banners be kept to a </p><p>minimum.  Less wisely, the demonstrators at the Chinese </p><p>Embassy ignored the emergency decree - and the fact that </p><p>civil liberties, including the right to assembly, have been </p><p>suspended.  Post will follow up on the extent and nature of </p><p>police actions against the demonstrators as well as the fate </p><p>of the missing man. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
