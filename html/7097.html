<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, KNNP, ENRG, IR, CA, IAEA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA TO RAISE IRAN CONCERNS - AGAIN - WITH </p><p>EL-BARADEI </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 79477 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In response to Under Secretary Bolton\'s request, </p><p>Canada will make reftel demarche to IAEA Director General </p><p>El-Baradei as soon as possible through the Canadian Head of </p><p>Mission in Vienna.  Terry Wood, Foreign Affairs Deputy </p><p>Director for Non-Proliferation, told us that the more Canada </p><p>learns about the Iranian nuclear program the greater its </p><p>concern.  He said that Canada will also stress the threat </p><p>this poses to the IAEA\'s credibility.  Indications that </p><p>El-Baradei is prepared to take a "flexible approach," as an </p><p>enticement for Iran to do the right thing, are disturbing. </p><p>Iran, Wood continued, cannot be held to a lower standard than </p><p>Canada and other IAEA members, who must comply to the letter </p><p>with their safeguards agreements. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Wood said that after El-Baradei\'s visit to Iran, the </p><p>IAEA Secretariat briefed the Canadian Mission on February 27. </p><p> The Canadian Head of Mission met with El-Baradei later that </p><p>day to express Canadian concerns about the results of the </p><p>visit, and made a "firm" statement on Iran at the IAEA Board </p><p>of Governors meeting in March.  Canada was subsequently </p><p>approached by the U.S. and the UK about convening an informal </p><p>group of IAEA members to address the Iran situation.  The </p><p>Canadian Head of Mission will be hosting a meeting on April </p><p>10 to assess interest in such a group.  If there is </p><p>sufficient interest, then this will be another occasion to </p><p>meet with El-Baradei. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Wood also confirmed that Jim Wright, Foreign Affairs </p><p>Assistant Deputy Minister for Global and Security Policy, </p><p>will be in Paris April 7-8 for the G-8 Senior Officials </p><p>meeting. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
