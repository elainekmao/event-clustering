<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002853 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EUR/PCI, OES/PCI, OES/ETC, OES/SAT </p><p>PLEASE PASS USDA/FOREST SERVICE, EPA/OIA </p><p>ALSO FOR USAID/EE/EEST (CMITCHELL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, TBIO, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: ENVIRONMENTAL HIGHLIGHTS, APRIL 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2287 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) This is one of a series of cables providing updates on </p><p>environmental issues in Turkey.  Below are topics covered in </p><p>this cable: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Update on merger of Environment and Forest ministries </p><p>2.  Turkish scientists receive satellite data </p><p>3.  Broad-based committee sets S&T priorities </p><p>4.  Water basin management in Turkey </p><p>5.  Lessons learned from water user associations </p><p>6.  The chatter on WWF-Turkey </p><p>7.  Ankara lawyers mark Earth Day </p><p>8.  Turkey updates its flora database </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>1.  THE LATEST ON THE MERGER OF MINISTRIES.  On 5/1, </p><p>Parliament began consideration of a proposal to merge the </p><p>Ministry of Environment (MOE) into the Ministry of Forestry </p><p>(MOF).  The MOE expects Parliament\'s expeditious approval. </p><p>By one estimate, the merger would take place within two </p><p>weeks.  With a merger expected to displace the current </p><p>Environment Minister Kursad Tuzman, MOE Undersecretary Hasan </p><p>Sarikaya may represent the MOE at the Kiev Environment for </p><p>Europe Ministerial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  SCIENTISTS TAPS INTO DATA FROM TWO SATELLITES. Following </p><p>an agreement between the Scientific and Technical Research </p><p>Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) and the European Space Agency </p><p>(ESA), ESA satellite data became available to Turkish </p><p>scientists in April.  The data from two satellites -- ERS </p><p>and ENVISAT -- will be used for geological, seismological </p><p>and archeological studies; monitoring pollution, environment </p><p>and land use; and scientific preparation for the Global </p><p>Monitoring of Environment and Security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. BROAD-BASED COMMITTEE SETS S&T PRIORITIES.  The 65-person </p><p>Steering Committee of TUBITAK\'s "Vision 2023," the strategic </p><p>document that will define S&T goals and priorities for the </p><p>country\'s second hundred years, recently determined that </p><p>priority S&T polices and practices will focus on increasing </p><p>Turkey\'s competitiveness in the global market, developing </p><p>S&T and innovation talent, promoting environmental </p><p>sensitivity and energy efficiency, and improving quality of </p><p>life. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  TURKEY CRITIQUES ITS OWN WATER BASIN MANAGEMENT. At a </p><p>workshop organized by the UN Food and Agriculture </p><p>Organization on land and water resource management, </p><p>representatives from government, international and NGO </p><p>organizations took a hard look at Turkey\'s water basin </p><p>management. Ismail Kucukkaya from the Ministry of Forestry </p><p>said that Turkey lacks effective strategies for following a </p><p>water basin approach to management. Water basins have </p><p>insufficient infrastructure and poor income generation </p><p>options for basin villagers, he said. Nermin Egeli from the </p><p>General Directorate of Rural Services urged Turkey to update </p><p>its basin land utilization plans and to establish protective </p><p>zones, technical protection teams, disaster assistance </p><p>teams, and monitoring plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. LESSONS LEARNED FROM GAP WATER USER ASSOCIATIONS. In </p><p>1991, the State Hydraulics Works (DSI) transferred 1,270,000 </p><p>ha of irrigated land (75 percent of Turkey\'s total irrigated </p><p>land) to irrigation associations, water user groups and </p><p>municipalities in the Southeastern Turkey Development </p><p>Project (GAP) region in order to develop a model irrigation </p><p>system.  According to the GAP\'s Gonca Karaca, the project </p><p>met with success in terms of providing modern irrigation </p><p>techniques but lacked landowner involvement in project </p><p>design, appropriately based water pricing (which she says </p><p>should be based on volume, not acreage) and sufficient </p><p>training for irrigation managers.  Ferayi Aslan, mayor of </p><p>Adala in the GAP region, noted that the biggest problem of </p><p>the 340 irrigation associations is inappropriate water </p><p>pricing which discourages conservation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  WWF-TURKEY: CLOSER TO MERGER WITH LOCAL AFFILIATE. Since </p><p>WWF-Turkey began its affiliation with DHKD (Foundation for </p><p>the Protection of Nature) in 1975, the two have tested the </p><p>waters of their relationship. In 2001, DHKD officially </p><p>became the national arm of WWF International but it </p><p>continued to use its highly recognizable DHKD logo as well </p><p>as that of WWF-Turkey.  Recently, DHKD members voiced </p><p>concern that the merger would foster a negative public </p><p>reaction to what will appear to be a non-Turkish </p><p>organization using an unfamiliar name ("WWF"). However, DHKD </p><p>board support for the merger remains firm.  About 90 percent </p><p>of WWF-Turkey/DHKD\'s projects are already administered under </p><p>the WWF-Turkey name. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, WWF recently began discussing its 2003-2008 plan. </p><p>New items on the agenda included a decision to press the GOT </p><p>to designate additional "specially protected areas" and </p><p>develop a strategy to protect those lands. WWF-Turkey also </p><p>discussed the possibility of proposing that Ramsar establish </p><p>a six-country Black Sea wetlands initiative, "BlackWet." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. ANKARA LAWYERS NOTE EARTH DAY. In a seminar on </p><p>"Environment, Man and War," several speakers noted that 35 </p><p>percent of the world\'s environmental problems come from </p><p>weapons testing and military exercises and operations.  The </p><p>program was sponsored by the Ankara Bar Association, the </p><p>Chamber of Environmental Engineers, the Turkish Human Rights </p><p>Protection Association (TIHAK), and the Turkish Foundation </p><p>for Combating Soil Erosion, for Reforestation and for the </p><p>Protection of Natural Habitats (TEMA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  TURKEY UPDATES ITS FLORA DATABASE. TUBITAK is updating </p><p>TUBIVES, its database of national flora and vegetation.  The </p><p>project is part of a biodiversity project aimed at </p><p>accounting for all living organisms in the country. TUBITAK, </p><p>the State Planning Office and Izzet Baysal University are </p><p>sponsoring the project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
