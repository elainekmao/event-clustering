<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 000625 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: THREAT TO CARDINAL RODRIGUEZ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Francisco L. Palmieri, Reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  At an event hosted by the Papal Nuncio, Cardinal Oscar </p><p>Rodriguez privately told the Ambassador that he had received </p><p>a recent death threat that he was taking very seriously. </p><p>Apparently, the gatekeeper at Cardinal Rodriguez\'s office had </p><p>been kidnapped while running an errand recently.   The </p><p>gatekeeper was blindfolded and driven around by a group of </p><p>individuals who were wearing army fatigues and had grenades </p><p>on their belts.  The group kept the gatekeeper blindfolded as </p><p>it drove him to a remote area.  Throughout the long drive, </p><p>the members were talking about how unhappy they were with the </p><p>Cardinal and his support for Maduro government policies. </p><p>They openly discussed their plans to destabilize the </p><p>government before finally making it clear that they were </p><p>going to kill the Cardinal.  The group allegedly offered to </p><p>pay the gatekeeper 7 million lempiras to set up the Cardinal. </p><p> They claimed to have conducted surveillance of the Cardinal </p><p>and to know his routines.  Eventually, the group allowed the </p><p>gatekeeper to escape after reaching a remote area by putting </p><p>down their weapons and leaving him unguarded. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Cardinal said he felt that this threat was the most </p><p>serious he had received.  He believed it was linked to either </p><p>his statements about the fugitive bankers or to a </p><p>long-standing conflict he has had with Jaime Rosenthal, a </p><p>Liberal Party leader and business oligarch from San Pedro </p><p>Sula.  The Cardinal made it clear that he was not afraid but </p><p>that the kidnapping represented an escalation that he had not </p><p>experienced before.  Previously he has received written and </p><p>telephonic threats.  The Ambassador encouraged him to bring </p><p>this information to Minister of Security and offered Embassy </p><p>assistance in evaluating the threat.  The Cardinal said he </p><p>would contact the Minister and expressed appreciation for the </p><p>Ambassador\'s offer. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Comment: We will keep our ears close to the ground to see </p><p>if we can pick up any other information related to the </p><p>Cardinal\'s security.  The Cardinal, while taking this threat </p><p>seriously, made it clear he did not plan to curtail any of </p><p>his efforts to root out corruption or to call attention to </p><p>the shortcomings in Honduran society. We have no way of </p><p>assessing the gatekeeper\'s credibilty. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
