<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 008708 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR DBIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOT Non-Committal on U.S. Non-Agricultural </p><p>Tariff Proposal </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: State 243208 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Econoff met with Tevfik Mengu, Acting Director </p><p>General for Agreements at the Foreign Trade </p><p>Undersecretariat, on November 29 to deliver reftel </p><p>demarche on our proposal for negotiating elimination of </p><p>all non-agricultural tariffs by all WTO members by 2015. </p><p>Econoff emphasized that, under the proposal, tariffs on </p><p>exports of interest to Turkey, particularly steel and </p><p>garments, would be eliminated, and that, Turkey, which </p><p>has sharply cut tariffs on industrial goods under its EU </p><p>customs union, would benefit greatly from tariff </p><p>elimination by all WTO members.  Mengu did not comment </p><p>on our proposal, other than to say that Foreign Trade </p><p>would study it carefully. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Comment:  In previous contacts with this agency, </p><p>Foreign Trade officials have stressed that Turkey\'s </p><p>trade liberalization in recent years has generally been </p><p>painful for domestic industry and opened up large trade </p><p>deficits.  They have been reluctant to consider </p><p>proposals which would dilute further the low tariff </p><p>protection (averaging four to five percent for non-EU </p><p>trade partners) the GOT is currently able to provide to </p><p>domestic industry. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
