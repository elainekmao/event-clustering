<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001137 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - MAXSTADT </p><p>STATE PASS TO DEPT OF EDUCATION FOR SECRETARY PAIGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, OVIP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION AT THE </p><p>INAUGURATION </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U) SUMMARY: Against the backdrop of significant </p><p>opposition criticism of the April 19 elections and vague </p><p>threats of &mass action8 against the new Administration, </p><p>President Obasanjo held a triumphal inaugural on May 29. </p><p>Security was tight but the events of inauguration week were </p><p>well organized and peaceful.  Because of the bruised feelings </p><p>of the opposition, this inauguration fell short of the near </p><p>universal euphoria experienced in 1999.  Yet, overall it was </p><p>celebratory.  The official USG delegation led by Secretary of </p><p>Education Rod Paige was well received by the GON.  The </p><p>delegation attended all key events including the inaugural </p><p>ceremony and subsequent gala dinner.  The delegation also met </p><p>President Obasanjo the day after his inauguration.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>RIGHT ON TIME FOR THE MAIN EVENT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) After stormy weather delayed the Presidential </p><p>delegation,s arrival in Abuja by a day, the delegation </p><p>arrived the morning of May 29, just in time to motorcade from </p><p>the airport to Eagle Square to witness the actual </p><p>inauguration ceremony.  Basically an asphalt lot with </p><p>bleachers on three sides, Eagle Square was well decorated and </p><p>colorful.  Over 28 Africa Heads of State (including </p><p>Cameroonian President Paul Biya, who entered the square to </p><p>loud applause), the U.K. Deputy Prime Minister, other </p><p>high-level official delegations, the People,s Democratic </p><p>Party national and state hierarchies, famous personalities </p><p>and numerous strap-hangers.  On the other end of the social </p><p>spectrum, and on the other side of the Eagle Square fence, </p><p>were literally thousands of Nigerian onlookers who were </p><p>curious but uninvited guests.  Interspersed among the invited </p><p>guests were some of Abuja,s most accomplished touts and </p><p>pickpockets, wanting to put their agile hands into the </p><p>pockets of some of Nigeria,s wealthiest as they passed </p><p>through the main pedestrian entrance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The inaugural ceremony lasted approximately two hours. </p><p> The Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, was sworn in first. </p><p>This had a bit of a comic element as Vice President Atiku </p><p>pointedly corrected the Chief Justice after the latter </p><p>inverted the Vice President,s name when administering the </p><p>oath. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Chief Justice Uwais had no trouble with President </p><p>Obasanjo,s name.  After being sworn in, Obasanjo delivered </p><p>his inaugural address.  Due to a poor sound system, the </p><p>address was inaudible to most of the attendees.  The event </p><p>took place with no demonstrations or violence of any kind. </p><p>After the swearing-in, Secretary Paige and his delegation </p><p>lunched with the Archbishop of Abuja, Dr. John Onaiyekan, who </p><p>led a discussion of the HIV/AIDS problem in Nigeria.  Joining </p><p>the Archbishop, representatives of Catholic Relief Services </p><p>briefed the delegation about their HIV/AIDS program and </p><p>USAID-sponsored operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The evening featured the Inaugural Gala and Banquet, </p><p>with cultural dances, music, a sampling of Nigerian cuisine, </p><p>and lots of comic relief.  During and after the meal, </p><p>numerous prominent Nigerians (including former Head of State </p><p>Shagari) and several Heads of State gave toasts in honor of </p><p>President Obasanjo.  Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Joachim </p><p>Chissano of Mozambique paid tribute to Obasanjo and </p><p>emphasized the importance of Nigeria to Africa,s political </p><p>future and economic development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>MEETING WITH OBASANJO </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Obasanjo,s schedule was hectic throughout the </p><p>inaugural week.  Not only did it include inaugural events and </p><p>planning, Obasanjo also hosted a NEPAD Summit and bilateral </p><p>meetings with many visiting Heads of State.  Nevertheless, he </p><p>made it a point to carve out time in his schedule to meet </p><p>Secretary Paige and the delegation.  That meeting came on </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Friday, the morning after the inauguration.  Originally, </p><p>Secretary Paige was to meet President Obasanjo after the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>President,s daily 6 a.m. prayer session.  Because this was </p><p>the first morning prayer after the inauguration, it lasted </p><p>longer than expected.  In the end, the delegation was asked </p><p>to join the President and his inner circle in prayer, where </p><p>requests for divine guidance and blessings for the two </p><p>countries and their people featured prominantly.  After the </p><p>meeting, the delegation exchanged courtesies and gifts with </p><p>the President, then departed for the airport and the long </p><p>flight home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Despite the criticism of the elections and the </p><p>threats to disrupt the inauguration, inaugural week passed </p><p>without incident.  Security was heavy and there were no </p><p>protests or violence.  Also Obasanjo made an astute political </p><p>move.  Holding the NEPAD Summit ensured the attendance of </p><p>over a score of African Heads of State.  This not only added </p><p>legitimacy to the inauguration, it also may have lessened the </p><p>inclination to protest, given the overwhelming security </p><p>presence to shelter the visiting Heads of State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The American official delegation and the unofficial </p><p>Congressional Black Caucus delegation were well received. </p><p>The warm reception denoted the continued goodwill in Nigeria </p><p>for America and the determination of the new Obasanjo </p><p>Administration to strengthen the bilateral relationship. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
