<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002872 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/17/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SNAR, PGOV, MOPS, MASS, IV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES COUNTERNARCOTICS, </p><p>THE ICC AND COTE D\'IVOIRE WITH NSA MOHAMMED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 192375 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Counternarcotics: During a brief October 10 meeting </p><p>with NSA Aliyu Mohammed, Ambassador Jeter underscored our </p><p>concern regarding the modest funding the GON had provided its </p><p>NDLEA this year.  The Ambassador noted that last year, NDLEA </p><p>funding was supplemented toward the end of the year, there </p><p>were no signs of a similar infusion now.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>told Mohammed the NDLEA funding levels would be a factor in </p><p>the upcoming USG narcotic certification process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Saying that he understood our position, NSA Mohammed </p><p>attributed the NDLEA/Presidency problem to the current </p><p>political bickering between the President and the National </p><p>Assembly.  The Executive-Legislative impasse had choked the </p><p>flow of funds for many Ministries and agencies, he asserted. </p><p>The NSA stated that he would raise the issue with President </p><p>Obasanjo and the Justice Minister at their next meeting. </p><p>(Note: Ambassador gave this same demarche to Attorney General </p><p>Agabi.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ICC-Article 98: Ambassador Jeter made reftel </p><p>demarche, underscoring that Nigeria\'s interests dovetailed </p><p>with ours, given the country\'s active role in African and </p><p>international peacekeeping missions.  Unlike Foreign Minister </p><p>Lamido who had registered strong opposition when we broached </p><p>the subject on an Article 98 agreement with him, Mohammed </p><p>took on board our arguments and seemed interested in </p><p>exploring possibilities.  He suggested that we send the draft </p><p>agreement to him so that he can confer with the Minister of </p><p>Justice and Minister of Defense.  The NSA also suggested that </p><p>the Ambassador also demarche these senior officials.  He did </p><p>not include the name of FM Lamido among those he would </p><p>consult.  (Note: The draft agreement has been sent to the </p><p>NSA.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Cote d\'Ivoire: Mohammed stated Nigeria supported the </p><p>Gbagbo government but stressed the only solution was to </p><p>negotiate.  Nigeria shared our concern that the attempt at a </p><p>military solution could further destabilize Cote d\'Ivoire and </p><p>drag its immediate neighbors into the fray.  Already Charles </p><p>Taylor was offering the use of his territory to counterattack </p><p>the rebels.  Mohammed stated President Obasanjo remained </p><p>engaged and recently held telephone conversations with </p><p>Chirac, Annan and Kufuor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) When asked whether Obasanjo\'s offer to provide </p><p>"safehaven" to the rebels still stood, Mohammed explained the </p><p>offer was not to extract all the rebels, only the leadership. </p><p> Nigeria did not know how many rebels there were, so it would </p><p>not make an open-ended commitment to take them all, he said. </p><p>Inviting several hundred rebellious Ivorians to Nigeria would </p><p>only turn Abidjan\'s headache into Abuja\'s, the NSA concluded. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
