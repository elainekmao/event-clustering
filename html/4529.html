<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003202 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, AF/EPS </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>STATE PASS DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, SENV, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECONOMIC ROUNDUP NOVEMBER 27 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2961 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Timothy D. Andrews, reasons 1.5 b and </p><p>d </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This periodic economic report includes: </p><p>--U.S./U.K. Team Bids on Management Contract for Nigerian PTT </p><p>--Nigeria Buys U.S.-Made Buses </p><p>--World Bank to Work Closer with States </p><p>--Environmental Success Story: Getting the Red Out in the </p><p>Delta </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S./U.K. Team Bids on Management Contract for NITEL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>2. New Jersey-based Africa Consortium is one of four </p><p>finalists for the three-year management contract for Nigerian </p><p>Telecommunications Limited (NITEL). The Consortium\'s bid </p><p>features Lucent, as well as the consulting branch of British </p><p>Telecom (BT), as principal vendors for the project. Chris </p><p>Vaios, Africa Consortium\'s Managing Director, told Econoff </p><p>that the three-year management contract could result in sales </p><p>of as much as $2 billion for the two companies. Lucent and BT </p><p>representatives, however, were careful to stress that their </p><p>companies have no equity stake in the consortium </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Vaios contends that his group is the most technically </p><p>competent of the bidders. He is confident that it will win </p><p>the competition unless political factors influence the </p><p>contract award. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Africa Consortium has its work cut out. As is </p><p>the wont of most businessmen, Vaios may have exaggerated the </p><p>group\'s technical edge over its competitors, some of whom are </p><p>also backed by European PTTs. More important, Africa </p><p>Consortium has no agent in Nigeria. The group\'s visit was </p><p>handled by a recently appointed State of New Jersey commerce </p><p>official who was unable to arrange a meeting with the Vice </p><p>President, even though Atiku was in town and normally would </p><p>have met this caliber of delegation. Business names are </p><p>important in Nigeria, and reticence to bill Lucent and BT as </p><p>part of the consortium may also hurt. Nevertheless, the </p><p>Bureau of Public Enterprise has a good track record on </p><p>transparency and the group should remain in the running. </p><p>However, as Vaios seems to understand, it would not be </p><p>unheard of for politics to intrude at some point. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria Buys U.S.-Made Buses </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>5. Sofitel Capital Corporation USA, Inc., a capital </p><p>investment company in Maryland, and Innochris Nigeria, Ltd., </p><p>one of the largest transportation companies in Nigeria, </p><p>signed a $12.9 million loan agreement to purchase 35 </p><p>U.S.-made buses. U.S. EX-IM Bank is expected to guarantee the </p><p>loan and Motor Coach Industries (MCI), the largest luxury bus </p><p>manufacturer in America, will supply the buses. This will </p><p>mark the very first time U.S.-manufactured buses will share </p><p>the roadways with the Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses that have </p><p>dominated this sector of the Nigerian transportation sector. </p><p>Sofitel is currently negotiating two similar deals with other </p><p>Nigerian transportation companies for the purchase of 60 </p><p>U.S.-made buses for a total value near $25 million, as well </p><p>as a loan for a company to provide airline services in </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>World Bank to Work Closer with States </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) World Bank Representative Mark Tomlinson recently told </p><p>Econoffs that the Bank is providing technical assistance to </p><p>the GON to improve Nigeria\'s capacity to absorb the nearly </p><p>$757 million in bank loans approved for the country. </p><p>Tomlinson explained that only $25 million of the approved </p><p>loan portfolio has been spent so far because of the lack of </p><p>institutional capacity at all levels of government to </p><p>implement projects under the Bank\'s strict fiduciary and </p><p>performance standards. Absent this institutional weakness, he </p><p>estimated that $75 million would have been spent by now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment: Tomlinson points the finger at the GON for </p><p>the slow implementation of bank loans. We believe that </p><p>Tomlinson was not so much concerned with the GON\'s ability to </p><p>spend as its ability to account for what is spent. GON </p><p>officials see their relationship with the bank differently. </p><p>They complain bitterly that the bank has not worked </p><p>diligently to honor its commitments to Nigeria. Instead, the </p><p>bank has engaged in an incessant game of "moving the goal </p><p>posts" that continually has placed new requirements on </p><p>Nigeria to tap into bank funds. True, Tomlinson may not </p><p>always be at his diplomatic best when dealing with the </p><p>relationship between the bank and the GON. However, given </p><p>legitimate concerns about malfeasance and corruption, the GON </p><p>should not have been totally surprised that the bank </p><p>presented stringent conditions for the release of funds. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>8. (C) Tomlinson has complained that the GON is unreceptive </p><p>to the Bank\'s attempts to build institutional capacity at the </p><p>federal level. The Nigerians have been insisting instead that </p><p>the Bank engage in more hands-off project financing. Because </p><p>of this difference in philosophy with the federal government, </p><p>Tomlinson has begun to focus more of the Bank\'s efforts at </p><p>the state level, where institutional responsibility for many </p><p>aspects of poverty alleviation rests. Tomlinson also told </p><p>Econoffs that before Bank spending can pick up again, Nigeria </p><p>must improve its macroeconomic fundamentals, adding that a </p><p>fresh agreement with the IMF would be a curative step. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment: The Bank has also been frustrated by GON </p><p>slowness in moving the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper </p><p>(PRSP) process forward. The GON likewise was further </p><p>disappointed by the Bank\'s decision to lower the level of its </p><p>lending program in Nigeria. A low point probably came in </p><p>September when Minister of Agriculture Bello publicly </p><p>criticized the Bank in front of Tomlinson and the press for </p><p>rejecting a $200 million loan for agriculture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) It is highly unlikely the Bank will find working with </p><p>the States any easier. Conventional democratic theory assumes </p><p>that state and local government will be more responsive to </p><p>local needs. However, what is in the textbooks differs from </p><p>actual practice in many if not most Nigerian states. The </p><p>spendthrift behavior of many states makes the federal </p><p>government look fiscally responsible. Few if any states have </p><p>developed the minimal due diligence and fiduciary standards </p><p>found at the federal level. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Environmental Success Story: Getting the Red Out in the Delta </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p>11. (SBU) Ken Clary, Managing Director of the Washington </p><p>State-based Environmental Distribution Network (EDN), cites </p><p>his organization as a model for others who wish to get </p><p>environmental contracts from the Niger Delta Development </p><p>Corporation (NDDC). EDN has signed a $1.7 million contract </p><p>for a water treatment program for eight villages and </p><p>anticipates additional projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Clary claimed he was able to avoid many of the </p><p>political pitfalls that have befallen others who wanted to </p><p>work with the NDDC and its widely discredited predecessor </p><p>OMPADEC (Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission). </p><p>Working with a Nigerian associate, Clary insisted the NDDC </p><p>fund all of his expenses up front. Clary says a major selling </p><p>point of his water treatment system was its ability to remove </p><p>iron from the ground water. "People got excited when they saw </p><p>that they could wash white clothes without the red tinge and </p><p>that sprinklers stopped staining the bottoms of white walls." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Clary sees oil service companies as even better </p><p>potential clients than the NDDC. "Many of the companies </p><p>operating in the Delta are in an environmental time warp. </p><p>They don\'t know about recent advances in the technologies </p><p>which are not only cleaner but more cost effective as well." </p><p>He says that despite tens of millions of dollars spent on </p><p>environmental projects in the Delta, very little visible </p><p>progress has been made. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Clary believes there has been a change of attitude </p><p>about the environment in the Delta, and there is now a grass </p><p>roots demand for real progress. People are demanding NDDC and </p><p>others restore water quality; Delta inhabitants are not just </p><p>settling for leveraging more money out of the government and </p><p>oil companies. Clary believes his company and other smaller </p><p>U.S. firms have almost unlimited opportunities if they hold </p><p>their ground and get the Nigerians to play the game on U.S. </p><p>standard business practice terms. Comment: Post applauds </p><p>Clary\'s enthusiasm for doing business in Nigeria, but our </p><p>experience here suggests that he may face more ruts and bumps </p><p>in the road ahead than he anticipates. End Comment. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
