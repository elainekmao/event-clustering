<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002415 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ASEC, ATRN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA ON ICAO RESOLUTION AND AVIATION INSURANCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 162488 (B) STATE 163307 (C) STATE 159498 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified, please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  On September 20 and 21, Econoff delivered Ref A and B </p><p>demarches to Assistant Director M.K. Ibrahim of the </p><p>International Organizations Department, Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs and separately to Chief Owodu, Technical Advisor to </p><p>the Minister of Aviation.  Ref C information was delivered </p><p>September 17 to the Ministers of Aviation and Foreign Affairs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Regarding the ICAO resolution (ref A), Ibrahim commented </p><p>that the Secretariat\'s language was not controversial.  He </p><p>expected that the GON could fully support the resolution, </p><p>although first the proposal would need to go through the </p><p>appropriate channels.  Ministry of Aviation\'s Chief Owodu </p><p>indicated he would be supportive of an ICAO resolution </p><p>condemning the attacks.  Owodu said that he was leaving </p><p>tomorrow (September 22) for the ICAO General Assembly and </p><p>would review the draft language prior to leaving. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  On the aviation insurance crisis (ref B), Chief Owodu did </p><p>not believe that Nigeria would be immediately affected by the </p><p>rise in insurance premiums.  The international flights, </p><p>except those within the sub-region, use aircraft owned by </p><p>Nigeria Airways\' joint venture partners.  However, he noted, </p><p>for the Lagos-New York flight, Nigeria Airways would need to </p><p>sit down with South Africa Airways and work out how these </p><p>costs might be shared.  Owodu was grateful for the </p><p>information and interested to learn about the options being </p><p>considered in the United States.  Owodu said this information </p><p>would help inform the Ministry on how to approach this issue </p><p>with Nigerian carriers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  In response to the information on changes to aviation </p><p>insurance polices, Assistant Director Ibrahim said that he </p><p>had anticipated something like this would happen.  He worried </p><p>that this crisis would be used as an excuse for the EU and </p><p>U.S. to subsidize domestic carriers, complicating </p><p>international discussions on competition policy and trade in </p><p>services. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
