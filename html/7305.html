<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002319 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/RPM AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PHUM, KDEM, OIIP, OTRA, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: MESSAGE FROM AMBASSADOR ON FUNDING FOR </p><p>U.S.-TURKISH JUDICIAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>REF: DRL (OZKAN)-EMBASSY ANKARA 3/24 EMAIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Two years of patience, persistence and cooperation among </p><p>Turkish and American agencies have yielded a successful </p><p>conclusion to a remarkable series of legal exchanges.  By the </p><p>end of 2002, nearly 600 Turkish jurists had participated in </p><p>discussions and workshops, debating solutions to problems </p><p>whose existence they had previously denied.  They have been </p><p>exposed to American and international approaches that the </p><p>insular training of Turkish judges heretofore has not </p><p>included.  Many participants have begun to adopt new tactics </p><p>and have called for further Turkish-American cooperation on </p><p>these issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Because this program so tangibly advances U.S. political </p><p>interests, it is essential that we strengthen and expand it. </p><p>To this end, three project proposals have been developed for </p><p>a second phase: 1) Judicial Oversight of Police Conduct; 2) </p><p>European Court of Human Rights Freedom of Expression </p><p>Standards; and 3) Accelerated Trial Proceedings/Trial </p><p>Alternatives.  DRL reports that OPDAT is best qualified to </p><p>run the Judicial Oversight program and already has the needed </p><p>funds.  DRL believes ISDLS is best qualified to run the other </p><p>two programs and has asked for Embassy\'s views on whether to </p><p>seek funding for both.  We strongly support funding for both </p><p>the Freedom of Expression and Accelerated Trial programs. </p><p>Both programs deal with fundamental U.S. human rights </p><p>concerns in Turkey.  Restrictions on non-violent expression </p><p>and lengthy judicial proceedings continue to undermine GOT </p><p>efforts to improve overall human rights conditions in Turkey. </p><p> By funding both programs we will ensure that the judicial </p><p>exchange program proceeds on a broad front and makes the </p><p>greatest possible impact. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
