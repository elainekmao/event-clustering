<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002324 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: "DAILY NEWS" COMMISSIONS NEW PRINTING PRESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Twenty months after its presses were destroyed by </p><p>    expertly placed, sophisticated explosive devices (no </p><p>    arrests were ever made) the independent "Daily News" </p><p>    inaugurated new presses.  In an October 22 ceremony </p><p>    attended by Zimbabwean media, human rights, law and </p><p>    business leaders, "Daily News" senior management </p><p>    thanked its supporters and spoke of the challenges the </p><p>    paper has overcome and still faces.  The planned </p><p>    highlight of the evening, pushing the button to start </p><p>    printing the next day\'s edition, did not take place </p><p>    because a strike by "Daily News" workers delayed the </p><p>    paper\'s production. </p><p> </p><p>2.   The perseverance of "Daily News" management and </p><p>    staff after the bombing is a remarkable story. </p><p>    Printing, collating (often by hand) and distributing </p><p>    the paper since the January 28, 2001 destruction of </p><p>    the original presses required daily creativity and </p><p>    chutzpah.  Remarkably, the "Daily News" never missed a </p><p>    day, although late delivery and poor print quality </p><p>    were chronic problems.  The new press, surrounded by </p><p>    impressive looking security walls, lights and cameras, </p><p>    is capable of quick and high-quality production.  One </p><p>    of the challenges for the "Daily News" now is to find </p><p>    additional business for the press so that it will </p><p>    produce revenue during the 20 hours per day when it is </p><p>    not printing the newspaper. </p><p> </p><p>3.   The "Daily News" also faces a continuing problem </p><p>    with distribution.  Ruling party supporters, including </p><p>    the so-called "war vets," have banned the paper in </p><p>    most small towns and extensive parts of rural </p><p>    Zimbabwe.  Copies of the newspaper are seized and </p><p>    burned in places like Rusape, Mutoko and Murewa.  The </p><p>    "Daily News" aims to be a national newspaper, and has </p><p>    the editorial and production capacity to do so, but </p><p>    only if Zimbabwe\'s rulers relax their prohibition on </p><p>    the independent media outside of the country\'s main </p><p>    cities and larger towns. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
