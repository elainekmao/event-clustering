<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001616 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EAID, PGOV, AORC, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: SIGNING OF NEPAL-ILO AGREEMENT ON US-FUNDED </p><p>CHILD LABOR PROJECT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Nepal and the ILO signed an agreement August 20 on </p><p>the implementation of an ILO/IPEC time-bound project to </p><p>eliminate the worst forms of child labor.  USDOL has </p><p>funded the project with more than USD 5 Million.  DCM </p><p>and LabOff attended the signing ceremony. </p><p> </p><p>2. Talks on the terms of the agreement had dragged on </p><p>for more than nine months.  Finance Ministry officials </p><p>attempted to insert a sentence into the agreement that </p><p>would allow the Auditor General of Nepal to audit the </p><p>project\'s accounts at any time.  The ILO objected, </p><p>arguing that as a member state the GON would have to </p><p>accept established UN audit procedures.  Post made </p><p>repeated representations, pressing the Finance Ministry </p><p>to expedite the negotiations.  In the end the GON </p><p>dropped its demand that the objectionable provision be </p><p>included. </p><p> </p><p>3. Post will continue to work with the ILO and Nepal\'s </p><p>line ministries to ensure the successful implementation </p><p>of DOL-funded initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
