<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 002023 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OSLO PLEASE PASS TO AMBASSADOR BURNS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IS, IT, KPAL, PREL, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY/MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS: BERLUSCONI WITH </p><p>PERES AND SHAATH IN VALENCIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINCOUNS THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, REASON 1.5 B, D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  ON APRIL 24, PM BERLUSCONI\'S SENIOR DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA TOLD EUR A/S ELIZABETH JONES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02023  241730Z </p><p>THAT THE PREVIOUS DAY\'S EU-MED MINISTERIAL IN VALENCIA HAD, </p><p>OBVIOUSLY, NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PROMOTING ISRAELI-ARABIC </p><p>DIALOGUE ON HALTING THE VIOLENCE.  EMBASSY FOUND HIS READOUT </p><p>OF PRIME MINISTER (AND ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER) BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>MEETINGS THERE WITH FM PERES AND PA OFFICIAL NABIL SHA\'ATH TO </p><p>BE OF INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ACCORDING TO CASTELLANETA, ISRAELI FM PERES HAD TOLD </p><p>PM BERLUSCONI THAT ISRAEL WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE CONVOKED BY THE QUARTET.  WHEN </p><p>PRESSED, CASTELLANETA CONFIRMED THAT PERES HAD EXPLICITLY </p><p>SAID QUARTET SPONSORSHIP, RATHER THAN INSISTING ON A </p><p>CONFERENCE SPONSORED BY THE US.  HE SPECULATED THAT THERE IS </p><p>A SENSE OF "FATIGUE" IN THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT NOW THAT THEY </p><p>HAVE ESTABLISHED A STRONGER MILITARY POSITION, AND THEREFORE </p><p>WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE TO NEGOTIATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN THE MEETING WITH PERES, BERLUSCONI OFFERED TO HOST </p><p>SUCH A MEETING IN ITALY, GIVEN THE GOI\'S PRESENTLY STRONG </p><p>RELATIONS WITH BOTH THE PALESTINIANS AND ISRAEL.  (BEFORE </p><p>LEAVING VALENCIA, BERLUSCONI STATED TO THE PRESS ITALY\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO HOST SUCH A CONFERENCE).  LATER APRIL 24, LUCA </p><p>FERRARI, MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN, </p><p>SAID THAT ONE OF THE DIPLOMATIC ADVISORS TO PM SHARON HAD </p><p>"INFORMALLY" RAISED WITH THE ITALIAN EMBASSY IN TEL AVIV HIS </p><p>VIEW THAT ITALY WOULD BE A NATURAL SITE FOR SUCH A MEETING. </p><p>FERRARI SAID THE ADVISER\'S STATEMENT HAD BEEN VERY </p><p>HYPOTHETICAL AND CONDITIONAL, BUT WAS A CLEAR EXPRESSION OF </p><p>SHARON\'S WILLINGNESS TO COME TO ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CASTELLANETA SAID THAT BERLUSCONI HAD BROACHED WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02023  241730Z </p><p>SHA\'ATH THE IDEA OF CREATING A "COUNCIL OF MINISTERS" TO TAKE </p><p>POLITICAL CONTROL OVER THE PALESTINIAN AREAS, WITH ARAFAT </p><p>OCCUPYING THE POSITION OF "HONORARY PRESIDENT."  NOT </p><p>SURPRISINGLY, SHA\'ATH DID NOT WISH TO MAKE ANY COMMENT ON </p><p>THIS IDEA.  FERRARI TOLD THE EMBASSY LATER APRIL 24 THAT </p><p>BERLUSCONI HAD AT LAST BROACHED WITH THE PALESTINIANS AN IDEA </p><p>THE MFA HAD PROPOSED TO HIM EARLIER THIS YEAR: THAT IT WAS </p><p>TIME FOR ARAFAT TO BEGIN DEVOLVING POWER TO A COMMITTEE OF </p><p>MINISTERS.  IN THE GOI\'S VIEW, THE PALESTINIANS WOULD BE </p><p>BETTER SERVED IF ARAFAT BECAME, SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, A </p><p>"MERE PRESIDENT", CEREMONIAL IN THE ITALIAN SENSE RATHER THAN </p><p>POWERFUL IN THE FRENCH SENSE.  ACCORDING TO FERRARI, ITALY </p><p>HAD NOT YET DISCUSSED THIS IDEA WITH EU PARTNERS, BUT HE </p><p>EXPECTED IT WOULD DO SO SOON. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02023 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
