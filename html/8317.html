DART Field Team West traveled to An Najaf on 24 May to </p><p>participate in special Marine and Army civil affairs </p><p>briefings for ORHA in which a 5 June mayoral election was </p><p>announced, possibly the first mayoral election in the </p><p>country.  WFP and MOT told the DART that they were ready to </p><p>begin governorate-wide distributions by 1 June.  MOT </p><p>offices remained intact during and after the war because MOT </p><p>personnel provided protection for their offices\' own </p><p>assets.  Doctors at the women\'s and children\'s hospital told </p><p>the DART that bad water, malnutrition, and poor sanitation </p><p>in An Najaf led to diarrhea in nearly every child patient </p><p>they treated.  The IRC discussed with the DART a draft </p><p>proposal to address emergency water and sanitation issues in </p><p>both An Najaf and Karbala.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>WFP, MOT PREPARED FOR JUNE DISTRIBUTION IN AN NAJAF </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  U.N. World Food Program (WFP) staff in An Najaf said </p><p>there were no major problems with the public distribution </p><p>system (PDS) in An Najaf Governorate and that the MOT would </p><p>be ready to begin distributions on 1 June.  According to </p><p>WFP, the An Najaf Ministry of Trade (MOT) offices were not </p><p>looted or damaged because MOT staff protected its assets, </p><p>including the PDS database.  It is intact and will be </p><p>utilized during June\'s distribution. MOT continues to </p><p>provide its own security, and WFP said security at the </p><p>facilities was not a concern. </p><p>Flour agents are conducting some flour distributions as a </p><p>means to clear older stocks. This distribution is also </p><p>intended to avoid beneficiary discontent. Apparently, </p><p>current flour stocks are of a lower quality flour than the </p><p>new flour supplies due in from WFP. Problems will arise if </p><p>some beneficiaries receive the lesser quality flour at the </p><p>same time their neighbors receive the new higher quality </p><p>flour. WFP said all beneficiaries would receive the new </p><p>flour during June distributions. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WFP reports a shortage in several ration commodities in </p><p>An Najaf stocks, particularly pulses. Stock inventories </p><p>indicate that An Najaf has no pulses, weaning cereal or </p><p>adult milk. WFP will attempt to locate and supply An Najaf </p><p>with the short commodities and is preparing public service </p><p>announcements detailing the June ration.  (Note:  Sufficient </p><p>quantities of dried whole milk for the adult ration are </p><p>missing from the nationwide pipeline.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  WFP is aware that An Najaf has five government-supported </p><p>hospitals, and institutions that feed orphans, the elderly, </p><p>and the disabled. WFP plans to work with MOT to ensure that </p><p>patients in these institutions will be included in future </p><p>distributions.  WFP has also discussed re-registration </p><p>issues with the MOT and said that the registration center </p><p>will be prepared to immediately adjust and correct any </p><p>registration errors and define procedures for those who have </p><p>lost their ration cards. </p><p>WFP has an eight-person staff in An Najaf and plans to hire </p><p>two additional employees. The estimated distribution period </p><p>for June will last 15 days. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>OTHER ISSUES </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  WFP staff had no information on what, if any, role it </p><p>would play in the planned purchase of local wheat grain. </p><p> </p><p>6.  No LPG supplies have arrived in An Najaf since March. </p><p>The Marines report that four tankers of LPG were inbound on </p><p>24 May but said this will not fully address the LPG </p><p>shortage. </p><p> </p><p>7.  An Najaf has received recent supplies of wheat and rice </p><p>and MOT has begun milling wheat at five fully functional </p><p>mills. Electricity coverage is at approximately 40 percent, </p><p>but all mills have generators and fuel. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>AN NAJAF PROTECTION ISSUES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  During the Civil Affairs orientation meeting, Coalition </p><p>forces explained that An Najaf will be the first city in the </p><p>country to hold general mayoral elections.  Voters need to </p><p>be over 18 years of age, have An Najaf residency for over </p><p>six months, and have no criminal record.   Candidates must </p><p>be over 40 years old with An Najaf residency for over six </p><p>months and a clean criminal record.  The election date is </p><p>set for 5 June, and it has become somewhat controversial </p><p>because several political parties with different religious </p><p>affiliations will be running, notwithstanding that the </p><p>interim mayor is Sunni in a primarily Shia community. </p><p>Coalition forces will be monitoring the elections to ensure </p><p>they are conducted safely and freely; however, issues of </p><p>intimidation and retribution may become a factor prior to, </p><p>during, and after these elections. </p><p> </p><p>9.  On the legal side, judges, including the chief judge, </p><p>were appointed (12 judges were removed because of Ba\'ath </p><p>party affiliation), and the justice system is beginning to </p><p>take shape.  An Najaf is in need of a courthouse since the </p><p>previous one was destroyed in the fighting.  The prison is </p><p>co-located at the training academy and major repairs to the </p><p>building are apparently needed. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Security continues to be an issue in An Najaf.  Six </p><p>patrols per day are being conducted by Coalition forces and </p><p>will eventually be handed over to the military police (MP). </p><p>A police academy has begun training police recruits.  As of </p><p>24 May, 680 police have been trained by 74 MPs.  The first </p><p>phase of the training is a two-day focus on community </p><p>policing.  They are planning on conducting phase two, which </p><p>consists of a five-day program focusing on specialized </p><p>skills. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Another Coalition source mentioned that there were five </p><p>known mass graves in the area and that there might be many </p><p>others.  The local community looking for loved ones have </p><p>disinterred many, if not all of these five sites.  The </p><p>Coalition source estimates that approximately 400,000 people </p><p>were killed in that area alone and that people were still </p><p>disappearing until the war began in March.  Although there </p><p>have not been any specific retribution issues thus far, the </p><p>Coalition source did say that a list has been circulating </p><p>with 75 names that says, "Your day is coming; retribution is </p><p>at hand."  He is attempting to locate a copy of this list. </p><p>The DART shared a copy of the Office of Transition </p><p>Initiative\'s two-page abuse prevention handout with the </p><p>Coalition forces.  There appears to be no human rights </p><p>organizations in An Najaf. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>VISIT TO AN NAJAF\'S HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Doctors at the An Najaf Hospital for Women and Children </p><p>told the DART that 85 to 90 percent of new child patients </p><p>suffer from diarrhea, and they suspect that some may suffer </p><p>from cholera.  The 200-bed hospital also receives two to </p><p>three malnutrition patients everyday.  The doctors with whom </p><p>the DART spoke did not know if the diarrhea and malnutrition </p><p>rates were higher than normal for this time of year.  The </p><p>immunizations program, which had slowed prior to the war, </p><p>has now ceased.  The infant mortality rate increased during </p><p>the war due to increased pressure on the staff and </p><p>insecurity, although staff continued to work.  The hospital </p><p>staff and nearby residents combined to ward off would-be </p><p>looters. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The hospital has running water most days of the week, </p><p>and the electrical power is "on and off."   A doctor said it </p><p>takes ten minutes from the time the electricity goes down to </p><p>the time the generator-powered electricity goes </p><p>on-dangerously affecting the low-weight babies in the </p><p>incubators.  Sometimes, two babies are placed in one </p><p>incubator because of demand and broken down equipment. </p><p>Sanitary and sewage conditions, described by one doctor as </p><p>"so bad," are in poor condition.  A receiving room was </p><p>teeming with flies.  There is one functioning telephone line </p><p>for the entire hospital, and the air-conditioning unit is </p><p>failing.  The doctors said the hospital requires about ten </p><p>oxygen cylinders each day.  It now rations two.  One staff </p><p>member said two to three children die each day for lack of </p><p>oxygen.  Some residents are staying away from the hospital </p><p>because they realize there are drug and equipment shortages; </p><p>others because of service charges.  The doctors admitted </p><p>that many of the hospital\'s problems existed for years. </p><p> </p><p>14.  There are shortages of many drugs and supplies, </p><p>including IV fluids and antibiotics.  "The most important </p><p>drugs are finished," said a female doctor.  If she could </p><p>change one thing in the hospital, she said she would abolish </p><p>the hospital\'s self-financing system that is burdensome on </p><p>poor patients.  Of the hospital\'s 38 specialized doctors, 23 </p><p>are female. The new hospital director was elected over three </p><p>other candidates late last month.   Hospital staff received </p><p>their USD 20 emergency payments, but not their regular April </p><p>or May salaries yet. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Last week, doctors said a Red Crescent Society (of </p><p>unknown origin) delivered a small quantity of drugs, and </p><p>CARE recently delivered lactose-free milk and high-protein </p><p>biscuits.  The doctors said no other agency had visited </p><p>after the war, though Coalition representatives had come </p><p>several times.  It was unknown whether drugs were available </p><p>in the governorate\'s drug warehouse.  An Najaf governorate </p><p>has a total of five hospitals, three of them in An Najaf </p><p>city, and 14 primary health centers. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>SPECIAL CIVL AFFAIRS BRIEFING IN AN NAJAF </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  The DART attended special Office of Reconstruction and </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) briefings on 24 May in An </p><p>Najaf by both the Marines and Army civilian affairs teams. </p><p>The city\'s hospitals were referred to as "atrocious."  The </p><p>Coalition forces have yet to provide assistance to </p><p>hospitals, and non-governmental organizations and others </p><p>have contributed only small quantities of drugs.  The sewer </p><p>system is old and needs to be rehabilitated.  At full </p><p>capacity, it would only service 20 percent of the city. </p><p>They said the incoming water is chlorinated, although its </p><p>filters needed to be replaced and some pumps and motors </p><p>overhauled. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Coalition forces said diesel fuel was needed for An </p><p>Najaf\'s power plant.  One turbine is currently running; two </p><p>are not.  He said that if all three were running, they would </p><p>provide only 40 percent of the city\'s electrical needs. </p><p>Fifteen trucks delivered gas yesterday, and four LPG trucks </p><p>were expected today. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Neither teachers, nor hospital employees, have been </p><p>paid April salaries yet, though they had received their USD </p><p>20 emergency payment.  Coalition forces said some teachers </p><p>were leaving their schools to earn money elsewhere.  The </p><p>textile industry, once a large employer in An Najaf, is </p><p>suffering because a large textile factory was destroyed in </p><p>the war.  Coalition forces also said another large industry, </p><p>date production, might be harmed because it was too late to </p><p>aerial spray the date trees. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
