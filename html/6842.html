<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000519 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF:  COLOMBO 508 </p><p> </p><p>1. In reftel we noted that as of mid-week (3/26) the war in </p><p>Iraq was receiving substantial front-page treatment but </p><p>limited editorial coverage.  The trend continued into </p><p>Thursday (3/27):  the war dominates this morning\'s front- </p><p>page above-the-fold headlines.  Again, however, only one of </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s dozen dailies editorializes on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>2. Front-page samples:  "US warplanes resume attack on </p><p>Republican Guards" and "Busch says Saddam\'s `day of </p><p>reckoning\' drawing near" headlined the English dailies. </p><p>The Sinhala press used headlines such as "Heaviest fighting </p><p>yesterday" and "43 US soldiers dead."  The Tamil press said </p><p>"big civilian losses in intensified air attacks on </p><p>Baghdad," "attack on Iraqi television center," "even after </p><p>7 days coalition forces unable to enter Baghdad," and </p><p>"uprising of Shia Muslims against Saddam." </p><p> </p><p>3. As on 3/26, however, front-page interest did not make it </p><p>to the editorial page.  On 3/27 only one of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>dozen dailies published an editorial regarding the war in </p><p>Iraq.  Under the headline "Lessons in adversity," the </p><p>ISLAND (opposition English daily, islandwide circulation) </p><p>spoke of the "Many ... adverse effects of the Iraq War </p><p>[that] will be felt by all countries and their economies </p><p>... if the war drags on....  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>"The price of petrol was hiked by Rs. 2 [or 4 percent] from </p><p>midnight yesterday.  The price of diesel remained static </p><p>but that will not keep prices of commodities that are </p><p>transported by diesel vehicles static, if we are to go by </p><p>the effect of oil price hikes on prices of essential </p><p>commodities in the past.... </p><p> </p><p>"Yesterday, it was reported that 70 per cent of the tea </p><p>offered at the Colombo auctions remained unsold.  When </p><p>Arabs don\'t get our tea, our small tea growers ... have to </p><p>starve and pray to the gods. </p><p> </p><p>"Many other adverse effects of the Iraq War will be felt by </p><p>all countries and their economies will be drastically </p><p>affected if the war drags on for a long time. </p><p> </p><p>"The Sri Lanka government can\'t be blamed, even though </p><p>comrades of the JVP and the Opposition PA will try to heap </p><p>it all on the government.  If blame is to be affixed, then </p><p>there are three persons who stand out:  Saddam Hussein, </p><p>George Bush and Tony Blair. </p><p> </p><p>"Who can help poor nations like Sri Lanka in this crisis? </p><p>Pro-Saddam, anti-Americans will say:  Go to Bush, he </p><p>started it all.  But Bush has had to go to Congress to </p><p>plead for $75 billion as the cost of the war and associated </p><p>expenses.  Blair is a poor cousin of Bush whereas Saddam </p><p>had been declared bankrupt and insolvent.  And even when he </p><p>had cash he preferred to bank in the western world and not </p><p>give it to the poor Third World. </p><p> </p><p>"Adversity teaches many lessons.  In this age where the </p><p>glories of globalisation and interdependence of nations </p><p>have been dinned into us, it brings home the stark reality </p><p>of self-reliance.  A nation has to be self-reliant in basic </p><p>commodities and the infrastructure that is called for to </p><p>provide the needs has to be protected.  There are the agro- </p><p>economists urging us to give up rice cultivation and other </p><p>traditional crops and to go in for cash crops and high </p><p>yielding varieties such as genetically manufactured crops. </p><p>For all that we will have to depend on the world outside. </p><p> </p><p>If there is a prolonged war over which small countries will </p><p>have no control, their only salvation will be in self- </p><p>reliance. </p><p> </p><p>This crisis we hope will awaken us all to the plight of </p><p>those people like the humble `goviyas\' [farmers] who are </p><p>now finding it hard to sell their rice harvest to private </p><p>dealers and a very reluctant government.  During the last </p><p>World War and many years after that Sri Lanka had to import </p><p>rice to feed a greater part of the population.  We tend to </p><p>forget all that.  Let it be realised that no nation can </p><p>dispense of the people who feed it. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
