<p>UNCLAS LAGOS 000363 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECA/IEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ENRG, EFIN, EPET, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NUPENG JOINS DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM </p><p>RESOURES STRIKE AS TALKS BEGIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) LAGOS 332, (B) LAGOS 344 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) As part of a solidarity agreement between the two </p><p>major oil workers\' unions, members of the Department of </p><p>Petroleum Resources (DPR) branch of the National Union of </p><p>Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) joined a strike </p><p>organized by DPR members of the Petroleum and Natural Gas </p><p>Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN).  Despite </p><p>the walkout by approximately 600 NUPENG members employed by </p><p>DPR, NUPENG General Secretary Joseph Akinlaja said there are </p><p>no plans to call for a union-wide national strike, adding </p><p>that NUPENG is "not interested in punishing people over </p><p>government negligence." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Two separate meetings were held on Wednesday, </p><p>February 19, to discuss issues involving unpaid salaries and </p><p>DPR autonomy.  In Lagos, DPR Director Macaulay Ofurhie met </p><p>with workers and promised to pay all wages and allowances </p><p>outstanding before the end of February.  However, </p><p>discussions in Abuja between PENGASSAN and GON officials </p><p>regarding DPR autonomy remain deadlocked.  NUPENG will join </p><p>the discussions when talks resume on Thursday, February 20. </p><p>Labor and Productivity Minister, Alhaji Musa Gwadabe, and </p><p>Special Presidential Advisor on Petroleum, Alhaji Rilwanu </p><p>Lukman, will head the GON delegation at Thursday\'s meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) PENGASSAN insists that the strike will continue </p><p>until the National Assembly moves forward with legislation </p><p>granting autonomy to DPR. If Thursday\'s talks fail, hope of </p><p>an early resolution could rest on Friday\'s meeting between </p><p>PENGASSAN and the Petroleum and Energy Committee of the </p><p>National Assembly. General Secretary of PENGASSAN, Kenneth </p><p>Narebor, told journalists yesterday that Friday\'s meeting </p><p>will determine future action.  He said the union "cannot </p><p>just call off the strike without any meaningful achievement, </p><p>because we are not ready to embark on the process again". </p><p>Narebor said PENGASSAN has decided to suspend further </p><p>actions "that will escalate the already tensed situation </p><p>until Friday\'s meeting with the National Assembly Committee </p><p>on Energy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (U) Comment:  Although the GON will probably fall short </p><p>on PENGASSAN\'s demands, the National Assembly will probably </p><p>accelerate its review of DPR\'s demand for autonomy.  DPR\'s </p><p>promise to pay outstanding salaries and a "good faith" </p><p>effort by the National Assembly to consider autonomy could </p><p>end the work stoppage. However, PENGASSAN\'s reluctance to </p><p>request that its entire membership join in a sympathy strike </p><p>despite an expired 72-hour ultimatum, demonstrates the </p><p>union\'s reported efforts to resolve the dispute without </p><p>creating a major industry-wide crisis.  U.S. oil companies </p><p>have reported no reduction in operations stemming from the </p><p>strike.  One source said his company has met all scheduled </p><p>loadings for its crude oil exports since the beginning of </p><p>the DPR walkout, and a relatively small-volume operator also </p><p>reports no disruption in processing whatsoever. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
