MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  06/02/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, EAID, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  In reaction to latest Tiger letter, GSL </p><p>proposes "clear the air" meeting with group </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 06/02/03 fax </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-SA/INS 05/30/03 unclass e-mail </p><p>-      (C) Tokyo 3490 (Notal) </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 910, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The GSL is proposing to hold a "clear </p><p>the air" meeting with the Tamil Tigers.  The </p><p>government\'s proposal is in response to the Tiger\'s </p><p>stark rejection of the latest GSL plan re control of </p><p>assistance to the north/east.  It is by no means clear </p><p>whether the Tigers will take the bait and agree to a </p><p>meeting.  It is also not clear where all of this leaves </p><p>the group\'s earlier decision not to attend the Tokyo </p><p>donors conference.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>GSL proposes Meeting </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The GSL is proposing to hold a "clear the air" </p><p>meeting with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE).  In a June 2 discussion, Ambassador Bernard </p><p>Goonetilleke, the chief of the government\'s Peace </p><p>Secretariat, told us that the offer was contained in a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>letter dated June 1.  Goonetilleke said the government\'s </p><p>letter had been provided directly to the Norwegian </p><p>government facilitators late June 1 and had, as far as </p><p>he knew, already been passed to the LTTE.  (Note:  Late </p><p>June 2, Mission received a text of the GSL\'s June 1 </p><p>letter referred to by Ambassador Goonetillke.  This </p><p>text is being e-mailed to SA/INS.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) When queried, Goonetilleke said the government\'s </p><p>letter made clear that the GSL wanted to use the </p><p>proposed meeting to work out all outstanding problems </p><p>with the LTTE.  The meeting would be useful, for </p><p>example, in reviewing the LTTE\'s concerns expressed in </p><p>its May 30 letter rejecting the GSL\'s latest proposal re </p><p>assistance delivery to the north and east (see below). </p><p>Part of the GSL\'s letter, Goonetilleke noted, reviewed </p><p>these LTTE\'s concerns, seeking to provide the group </p><p>further assurances that the proposal was fair and would </p><p>involve the LTTE in all key decisions made in regard to </p><p>assistance for the north/east.  Regarding the possible </p><p>timeframe for the proposed meeting, Goonetilleke said </p><p>the GSL basically wanted it to take place as soon as </p><p>possible and even before the June 9-10 Tokyo donors </p><p>conference if that could be arranged.  (Note: </p><p>Goonetilleke was not clear on whether the GSL\'s letter </p><p>mentioned the Tokyo conference, which the Tigers have </p><p>said they will not attend -- See Para 9 for more on this </p><p>issue.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Goonetilleke said he was not optimistic or </p><p>pessimistic about whether the LTTE would take the GSL up </p><p>on its offer for a meeting.  He said he thought the </p><p>group would do so if "it was sincerely interested in </p><p>getting to the roots of the problems affecting the peace </p><p>process," however. </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>Latest Letter from Balasingham </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>5.   (U) The government\'s request for a face-to-face </p><p>meeting came in response to the Tiger\'s stark rejection </p><p>of the latest GSL proposal re assistance to the </p><p>north/east.  (Note:  The LTTE\'s letter to the GSL </p><p>rejecting its latest proposal was posted on a pro-LTTE </p><p>website late May 30.  The text of this letter was passed </p><p>to SA/INS in Ref B.  The GSL\'s latest proposal, which is </p><p>sketched out in Refs A and D, was passed to the LTTE by </p><p>the Norwegian facilitators on May 28.  End Note.)  In </p><p>his tightly-worded letter addressed to Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe, the Tiger\' London-based spokesman Anton </p><p>Balasingham made clear that the government\'s proposal </p><p>did not go nearly far enough in giving the Tigers </p><p>effective administrative control in the north and east. </p><p>On this point, Balasingham -- making clear that the </p><p>Tigers wanted to control an interim structure with </p><p>responsibility for political aspects, as well as those </p><p>assistance-related -- said the following: </p><p> </p><p>"Having studied the contents of (the GSL\'s) proposals, </p><p>we are surprised, and at the same time dismayed that </p><p>your government did not address the critical issue of </p><p>setting up an interim administrative structure for the </p><p>northeast as suggested by the LTTE leadership.  Instead, </p><p>you have proposed a development-oriented structure with </p><p>extremely limited powers in which the participatory role </p><p>of the LTTE is not clearly defined, or rather, left </p><p>deliberately ambiguous." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Balasingham\'s letter went on to criticize the </p><p>government\'s (very complex) proposal in some detail.  He </p><p>stated that the GSL plans to form a joint GSL-LTTE </p><p>"apex" body for supervision of assistance implementation </p><p>was not acceptable because the body "had no </p><p>administrative powers, but is only an advisory council." </p><p>In addition, the "failure to define the participatory </p><p>role of the LTTE in the apex body is a major flaw in the </p><p>entire project."  Balasingham also asserted that other </p><p>key functions provided for in the government\'s plan, </p><p>including those involving a "special commissioner" and a </p><p>"management board," did not include clear references to </p><p>LTTE participation in their deliberations. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) In other passages of note: </p><p> </p><p>-- Balasingham states that the Tigers were very </p><p>disappointed that the GSL had allowed "international and </p><p>regional players...to treat the LTTE shabbily as a </p><p>proscribed entity with the `terrorist\' label to be </p><p>excluded from international forums."  (Note:  This is a </p><p>reference, at least in part, to the fact that the LTTE </p><p>could not attend the Washington seminar in April, as it </p><p>is on our Foreign Terrorist Organizations, "FTO," list.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Still on international issues, Balasingham again </p><p>takes the government to task, asserting that the GSL is </p><p>trying to set up "a grand international `safety net\' to </p><p>bring undue pressure on the freedom of our people to </p><p>determine their political status and destiny." </p><p> </p><p>-- The letter hits out at President Kumaratunga, the </p><p>PM\'s partner in a stressful cohabitation arrangement, </p><p>stating:  "We can certainly understand the fragile </p><p>position of your government caught up with an enraged </p><p>president seeking revenge and an entrenched constitution </p><p>that allows no space for maneuver." </p><p> </p><p>--  Balasingham also categorically rejects a reference </p><p>in the government\'s proposal to the effect that the GSL </p><p>and the provincial government have "responsibility" for </p><p>administration in the north/east.  Balasingham states: </p><p>"You have conveniently ignored the stark reality that </p><p>the LTTE runs a de facto administration of its own in </p><p>vast tracks under its control in the northeast." </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The idea for a "clear the air" meeting is </p><p>certainly a good one.  (Note:  At the risk of falling </p><p>victim to the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy, we </p><p>should point out that this is exactly what we proposed </p><p>to the PM and Minister Moragoda on three occasions in </p><p>May.)  If the Tigers really want to get the peace </p><p>process unstuck quickly, one would think the group would </p><p>jump at the opportunity for such a meeting.  It is by no </p><p>means clear whether the Tigers will do that, however. </p><p>The group has been quite truculent of late and it is not </p><p>clear whether it wants a quick solution to the problems </p><p>it sees, or whether it prefers to keep bashing the GSL </p><p>for its alleged failings. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) It is also not clear whether all of this might </p><p>lead the Tigers to reconsider their earlier decision not </p><p>to attend the Tokyo donors conference.  It is </p><p>interesting that in their long letter dated May 30 the </p><p>Tigers never mentioned Tokyo even once.  Some observers </p><p>take this as a hint that the group may not have finally </p><p>foreclosed on being represented at the key conference at </p><p>some level.  One idea that might be in the GSL\'s and the </p><p>Norwegian facilitators\' minds might be to try to hold </p><p>the proposed face-to-face meeting in Tokyo before or </p><p>after the conference.  This would be a fine idea, too, </p><p>but it all hinges on the Tigers, who have not been very </p><p>cooperative of late.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
