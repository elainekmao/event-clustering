SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI\'S COLUMNISTS ASKED IF THIS IS THE </p><p>START OF THE TRANSFER, WHILE CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR\'S COLUMNISTS HIGHLIGHTED THE </p><p>POSITIVE HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWS REPORTS </p><p> </p><p>JORDANIAN DAILIES ON JULY 8 WERE DOMINATED BY THE </p><p>JORDANIAN MINISTER OF INFORMATION\'S DENIAL OF PRESS </p><p>REPORTS THAT JORDANIAN TERRITORIES WOULD BE USED AS A </p><p>LAUNCHING GROUND FOR AN ATTACK AGAINST IRAQ, AND HIS </p><p>ACCUSATION THAT THESE REPORTS ARE PART OF AN INSIDIOUS </p><p>CAMPAIGN TO CAST DOUBT ON JORDAN\'S NATIONALIST </p><p>CREDENTIALS.  THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALSO </p><p>ADDED HIS ASSERTION THAT JORDAN RESPECTS IRAQ\'S UNITY </p><p>AND REFUSES THE USE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THAT COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>REPORTS ALSO ADDRESSED THE SACKING OF THE DIRECTOR OF </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE IN THE WEST BANK. </p><p>SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI REFERRED </p><p>TO "CONFLICTING REPORTS ON THE DISMISSAL, WHILE OTHER </p><p>DAILIES REPORTED THAT THE DISMISSAL HAS TAKEN PLACE, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TALKS AND THE POLITICAL FANTASIA </p><p>PROMINENT JORDANIAN COLUMNIST TARIQ MASARWAH WROTE IN </p><p>SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY </p><p>8: "NO ONE SHOULD HAVE DELUDED HIMSELF INTO THINKING </p><p>THAT A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TO THE SABRI-ANAN TALKS </p><p>WOULD HAVE OPENED THE ROAD TO A SETTLEMENT.  ANA\'S TASK </p><p>WAS TO ASK IRAQ FOR THE RETURN OF THE WEAPONS </p><p>INSPECTORS, PERIOD.  SHOULD HE GO BEYOND THIS SCRIPT, </p><p>HE REMEMBERS VERY WELL HIS PREDECESSOR WHO WAS SACKED </p><p>BY WASHINGTON BECAUSE HE DISOBEYED INSTRUCTIONS AND </p><p>PUBLISHED THE REPORT ON THE QANA MASSACRE IN KEEPING </p><p>WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION. IRAQ\'S PROBLEM IS </p><p>WITH THE U.S. ONLY.  ARAB RELATIONS OR RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE GULF WILL NOT PLAY ANY ROLE IN LIFTING THE </p><p>SANCTIONS, NOT IN PREVENTING THE AMERICAN AGGRESSION </p><p>AGAINST THAT COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>-- HAS THE TRANSFER STARTED? </p><p>PROMINENT COLUMNIST FAHED AL-FANEK WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY 8: "IN </p><p>1948, JORDAN OPENED ITS BORDERS TO PALESTINIAN </p><p>IMMIGRATION IN PREPARATION FOR ANNEXING THE WEST BANK. </p><p>IN 1967, JORDAN DID THE SAME ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS, </p><p>AND EACH TIME THIS ONLY SERVED TO EMPTY PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES OF THEIR POPULATION AND TEMPT ISRAEL TO </p><p>ANNEX THIS TERRITORY.  EGYPT, BY CONTRAST, DID NOT ACT </p><p>ON THE SAME HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS IN GAZA, WHICH IS NOW </p><p>SO DENSELY POPULATED THAT ISRAEL CANNOT WAIT TO GET RID </p><p>OF IT. IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE NUMBER INCOMERS AND </p><p>OUTGOERS ARE EQUAL, AN ASSERTION THAT ONLY AIMS TO DENY </p><p>THE PROBLEM.  IF WE ARE KEEN TO KEEP THE WEST BANK </p><p>PALESTINIAN, WE SHOULD START BY KEEPING JORDAN </p><p>JORDANIAN." </p><p> </p><p>-- REGARDING THE  MINISTER OF INTERIOR\'S STATEMENT ON </p><p>PROCEDURES AT THE BRIDGE </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST YASSER ZA\'ATREH WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON JULY 8: "THIS IS </p><p>A NORMAL SEASON WHEN MANY PEOPLE COME TO SEE THEIR </p><p>RELATIONS, THEN RETURN HOME.  AS FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO </p><p>ESCAPE, THEY PREFER A LESS BUSY MONTH TO GO TO ANY OF </p><p>THE FOREIGN CONSULATES IN JERUSALEM TO GET AN EASY </p><p>VISA.  THE MEASURES TAKEN BY THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR </p><p>WERE NECESSARY AND WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL RESOLVE THE </p><p>SEASONAL PROBLEM.  WE ALSO ADD OUR ASSERTION THAT NO </p><p>ONE MUST THINK OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AS A HERD OF </p><p>SHEEP WHO CAN SIMPLY BE LOADED ONTO TRUCKS AND DUMPED </p><p>ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER.;  DO YOU NOT REMEMBER </p><p>THE HEROES OF MARJ AL-ZUHOUR?" </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
