<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KHARTOUM 07632 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356;  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PINS, PGOV, SU, EG, NL, GE, IT, UR, MO </p><p>SUBJECT:  DIPLOMATS AGREE--BASHIR IS HERE TO STAY, IF NOT </p><p>          FOREVER AND A DAY </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AT LUNCH HOSTED BY CHARGE JULY 24 SIX SENIOR </p><p>DIPLOMATS ASSIGNED TO KHARTOUM EXPRESSED THEIR CONVICTION </p><p>THAT THE BASHIR GOVERNMENT WILL REMAIN IN POWER FOR THE </p><p>FORESEEABLE FUTURE--AT LEAST SIX MONTHS, POSSIBLY A </p><p>YEAR.  UNLIKE EARLIER MEETINGS WHICH WITNESSED WIDELY </p><p>DIFFERING VIEWS, THIS TIME OUR COLLEAGUES WERE UNANIMOUS, </p><p>NOT ONLY IN THEIR PREDICTIONS, BUT ALSO IN THEIR REASONS </p><p>FOR THE PREDICTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE FOLLOWING CHARGES/DEPUTY CHIEFS OF MISSION </p><p>ATTENDED AS DID POLCOUNS: </p><p> </p><p>DR. AXEL WEISHAUPT, FRG </p><p>MR. VICTOR GOGUITIDZE, USSR </p><p>MR. MARCO CONTICELLI, ITALY </p><p>MR. MOHAMED ABDEL WANIS, EGYPT </p><p>MR. JONE BOS, THE NETHERLANDS </p><p>MR. MOHAMED BOU DRIF, MOROCCO </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES ATTRIBUTED OMAR\'S STRENGTH TO </p><p>THE UBIQUITOUS SECURITY SERVICE AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>DEMONSTRATED WILL TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION AGAINST </p><p>OPPONENTS.  THE SUDANESE, THEY AVERRED, HAVE BEEN COWED </p><p>AND POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE LEADERSHIP ELIMINATED FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING.  THAT SAID, THEY BELIEVE THAT OMAR CANNOT </p><p>REST EASILY; THAT HE WILL ULTIMATELY BE REPLACED BUT NOT </p><p>IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THEY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GROWING NIF INFLUENCE AND </p><p>BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE NIF ATTEMPTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE </p><p>MILITARY (WHICH THEY CONSIDER INEVITABLE), THE REACTION </p><p>WILL BE VIOLENT AND BLOODY WITH OMAR AND THE NIF BOTH </p><p>BEING DEPOSED.  ABDEL WANIS (EGYPT) WAS THE MOST </p><p>EXPANSIVE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE GROUP, ESPECIALLY </p><p>REGARDING CONTINUING LOW LEVEL DISCONTENT WITHIN SUDAN\'S </p><p>MILITARY.  HE DID, HOWEVER, PERHAPS IN RECOGNITION OF </p><p>EGYPTIAN POLICY, OVEREMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) IN THE GOS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>O\'NEILL </p><p></p></div>
