(A) ANKARA 2445 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 1952 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by EconCounselor Scot Marciel.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Reftel reported that BOTAS executives had informed </p><p>Embassy that the storage tanks at Ceyhan were full with about </p><p>6.5 million barrels of oil from the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik </p><p>(Ceyhan) pipeline.  Based on questions from Washington, </p><p>Embassy double-checked the figures today.  BOTAS Deputy </p><p>General Manager Fuat Celepci onfirmed that the tanks were </p><p>full, and said the amount involved was just under 1.5 million </p><p>cubic meters.  He was not sure of the formula to convert </p><p>cubic meters (which BOTAS uses) into barrels, but estimated </p><p>it at 6.3 barrels per cubic meter, which would produce a </p><p>figure of 9.3 million barrels of oil in storage rather than </p><p>the 6.5 million we were originally told. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Celebci also confirmed that UN officials were still </p><p>present in Ceyhan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment:  BOTAS executives have consistently said all </p><p>12 of the storage tanks in Ceyhan were full.  We believe that </p><p>the original figure they gave us was based on an improper </p><p>conversion of cubic meters into barrels, and was not an </p><p>attempt to mislead. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
