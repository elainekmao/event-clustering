Kelly.  Reason: 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  In his first comprehensive statement on </p><p>Canada\'s Iraq policy, and an effort to make amends with the </p><p>U.S., Prime Minister Chretien urged the House of Commons </p><p>April 8 to vote for a resolution supporting "our friends in </p><p>battle" and hoping "for a quick victory with minimum </p><p>casualties."  The PM prefaced his statement by noting that he </p><p>strongly disagreed with statements made by Members of his </p><p>Caucus, "which we all wish had not been said."  He also </p><p>commended President Bush for his continued dedication to </p><p>poverty eradication, combating AIDS and improving trade and </p><p>development in Africa.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A wake-up call for ordinary Canadians </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) In the 10 days since Ambassador Cellucci voiced U.S. </p><p>disappointment with Canada\'s posture on Iraq (reftel), the </p><p>business community and Canada\'s "silent majority" have taken </p><p>to the streets and sought opportunities to demonstrate </p><p>solidarity with America.  New poll results indicate that a </p><p>majority (54 percent) of Anglophone Canadians currently </p><p>"approves" of military action in Iraq, with a conservative </p><p>poll specifically indicating that 72 percent believe Canada </p><p>"should have" supported the U.S. at the start of the war. </p><p>The weekend following the Ambassador\'s speech, a gathering of </p><p>nearly 4,000 - the largest of any group to demonstrate in </p><p>Ottawa since the start of military action - assembled at </p><p>Parliament Hill in a show of support for the U.S. and for </p><p>coalition forces.  Similar events have taken place in other </p><p>Canadian metropolises. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Fears of an economic backlash against Canadian </p><p>business interests prompted Liberal backbench MP Dennis Mills </p><p>to invite U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue to </p><p>meet with a group of 200 Canadian business leaders. Donahue </p><p>reportedly proved effective in delivering reassurances that </p><p>business relations would continue to remain on track.  At the </p><p>same time, however, he did not shrink from conveying the </p><p>message that "many Americans ... found personal attacks on </p><p>President Bush ... offensive and hurtful," and reiterating </p><p>that "the U.S. agenda was profoundly reshaped by 9/11."  In a </p><p>separate interview with journalists, Mr. Donahue debunked the </p><p>widely held notion that the U.S. is in Iraq for the oil, </p><p>noting that the major supplier of energy to the U.S. is </p><p>Canada. </p><p> </p><p>The Government tries to make amends </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Meanwhile, in the House of Commons the government </p><p>has had its back against the wall, consistently drawing fire </p><p>from the entire spectrum of opposition parties for its </p><p>waffling position on various aspects of the war in Iraq. </p><p>Ministerial testiness has become increasingly apparent in the </p><p>daily Question Period, as embattled Cabinet Members have </p><p>parried NDP (left-leaning) and Bloc Quebecois criticism of </p><p>Canadian soldiers being "embedded" with U.S. and U.K. troops </p><p>in Iraq under routine exchange programs, while the Canadian </p><p>Alliance (right) has nailed the government for failing to </p><p>adequately support such personnel. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Liberals moved swiftly to counter a Canadian </p><p>Alliance motion calling on the House to regret and apologize </p><p>for "offensive and inappropriate statements" against the U.S. </p><p>by Members of the House, and wishing the U.S. success in </p><p>removing Saddam Hussein from power.  In a special session on </p><p>April 8, Prime Minister Chretien urged the House to support a </p><p>government counter-motion calling for the coalition to "be </p><p>successful" in its mission in Iraq, and pledging the </p><p>government\'s readiness to participate "as soon as possible" </p><p>in the reconstruction of Iraq.  He said the government cared </p><p>"about the outcome even if we are not participants in the </p><p>war.  This means that we should not say things that could </p><p>give comfort to Saddam Hussein and this means that we should </p><p>not do things that would create real difficulties for the </p><p>coalition." Turning to the longer-term requirements of peace </p><p>and security throughout the troubled regions of the world, </p><p>the PM went on to praise President Bush\'s leadership in and </p><p>commitment to combating aids in Africa and his recognition of </p><p>the importance of poverty, trade and development, even in the </p><p>face of the terrorist threat. </p><p> </p><p>...But Can Go Only So Far </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, IZ, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA-IRAQ: PUBLIC OPINION MORE FAVORABLE; </p><p>GOVERNMENT TRYING TO REPAIR DAMAGE </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) In his speech, the PM criticized the Canadian </p><p>Alliance\'s call for a House apology as an assault on Members\' </p><p>rights of free speech, noting that it would "cast a chill" on </p><p>the rights and privileges of MPs that are fundamental to </p><p>Canada\'s democracy.  He defended the government\'s "decision </p><p>of principle" not to support the coalition, stressing the </p><p>consistency of its position from the beginning, and invoking </p><p>his oft-repeated phrase that "close friends can disagree at </p><p>times and can still remain close friends." By way of example, </p><p>Chretien alluded to how Canada\'s opposition to the war in </p><p>Vietnam did not damage its friendship with America and he </p><p>recalled with pride the heroic role, 23 years ago, of </p><p>Canada\'s Ambassador to Iran in rescuing U.S. Embassy </p><p>personnel in Tehran.  He went on to commend Canada\'s show of </p><p>solidarity with the U.S. in the wake of the September 11 </p><p>terrorist attacks. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  The Prime Minister\'s remarks reflect the </p><p>Liberal Party\'s awareness of the damage to its image </p><p>inflicted by the government\'s haphazard and clumsy approach </p><p>to policy on Iraq.   The fact that Chretien read a prepared </p><p>text - rather than speaking extemporaneously as is his habit </p><p>- was no accident.   As a close adviser of the PM confided to </p><p>Charge, the message was painstakingly choreographed to mend </p><p>fences with the U.S., while trying to balancing the broadly </p><p>divergent views within the Liberal Caucus.  END COMMENT. </p><p></p></div>
