<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000144 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE, EUR/RPM, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, BK, HR, SR, IT, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI ON DAYTON ARMS CONTROLS NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 5730 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS.  REASON: 1. </p><p>5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  ACCORDING TO MFA OSCE OFFICE DIRECTOR FABIO </p><p>CRISTIANI, THE GOI CONCURS WITH USG POLICY OBJECTIVES FOR THE </p><p>DAYTON ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENT FOR THE NEXT 12-18 MONTHS AS </p><p>OUTLINED REFTEL.  HE TOLD POLOFF ON DECEMBER 10 THAT HE </p><p>AGREED WITH THE NEED FOR CONTACT GROUP PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>PARTIES FOR PROGRESS ON ARTICLE IV ISSUES.  HOWEVER, THE GOI </p><p>WOULD RATHER NOT LINK THE TIMELINE FOR PROGRESS TO GEN. </p><p>ZAPPULLA\'S MANDATE AS OSCE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE. </p><p>ZAPPULLA\'S TERM IN OFFICE "DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS" CONTINUED </p><p>CRISTIANI, AND WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW A CHANGE IN THAT TERM TO </p><p>GIVE THE PARTIES AN EXCUSE FOR LACK OF PROGRESS. THE CONTACT </p><p>GROUP SHOULD PRESENT TO THE PARTIES A 12-18 MONTH ENDPOINT </p><p>WITH MEASURABLE BENCHMARKS, WITH NO LINK TO ZAPPULLA\'S </p><p>DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  THE GOI AGREES WITH THE USG CURRENT EVALUATION ON </p><p>ABUSE OF THE EXCEPTIONS REGIME, BUT IS LESS PESSIMISTIC ON </p><p>FUTURE PROGRESS.  BASED ON ZAPPULLA\'S OWN RECENT EVALUATION, </p><p>CRISTIANI HOPED THAT STATE INSPECTIONS COULD BEGIN THIS </p><p>SPRING.  SIMILARLY ON DECOMMISSIONING, THE GOI AGREES THAT </p><p>THE PARTIES SHOULD MOVE UP THE AGREED DATE FOR ELIMINATING </p><p>EQUIPMENT, BUT WONDERED WHETHER THIS ACCELERATION WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS, AND WHERE THOSE FUNDS WOULD COME </p><p>FROM.  NONETHELESS, THE GOI WOULD JOIN ANY CONTACT GROUP </p><p>EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE THESE PROCESSES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  CRISTIANI THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS ALSO A GOOD TIME TO </p><p>MOVE ARTICLE II RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE OSCE MISSION IN </p><p>SARAJEVO.  HE FORESAW NO PROBLEM WITH OTHER CG MEMBERS </p><p>(INCLUDING WITH RUSSIA) IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROPOSAL. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
