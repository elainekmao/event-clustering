REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN THEIR TWO-DAY RAID ON MDC OFFICES, POLICE AND </p><p>CIO AGENTS SEIZED PAPER FILES AND DISKETTES, AND </p><p>DOWNLOADED COMPUTER FILES.  SEIZED DOCUMENTS INCLUDED THE </p><p>MDC\'S MEMBERSHIP LISTS, FUNDING SOURCES, STRATEGIES FOR </p><p>THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL CHALLENGES AND THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND EVIDENCE GATHERED ON THE </p><p>MURDERS AND OTHER VIOLENCE COMMITTED DURING THE PRE- </p><p>ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  ALL THE SEIZED INFORMATION WAS </p><p>RETURNED ON SEPTEMBER 16 ON THE INSTRUCTION OF A HIGH </p><p>COURT ORDER.  MDC MP TENDAI BITI SPECULATED THAT THE </p><p>SERVING OF LEGAL PAPERS ON PRESIDENT MUGABE IN NEW YORK </p><p>HAD EMBARRASSED HIM AND LED HIM TO RETALIATE.  HOME </p><p>AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN NKOMO IS EXPECTED TO SPEAK TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT ABOUT THE RAIDS ON SEPTEMBER 19, AND BITI HAS </p><p>HEARD THAT NKOMO MAY LINK SENIOR MDC OFFICIALS TO ILLEGAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WEAPONS IMPORTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) LAST WEEK\'S RAIDS WERE THE LATEST CHAPTER IN THE </p><p>GOZ\'S CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST THE MDC.  IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR HOW FAR THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO GO, AND THE USG </p><p>NEEDS TO BE PREPARED WITH A STRONG RESPONSE IF IT BECOMES </p><p>CLEAR THAT THE GOZ IS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MDC AS A </p><p>VIABLE OPPOSITION PARTY.  NKOMO\'S SEPTEMBER 19 SPEECH </p><p>SHOULD PROVIDE A GUIDE TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S INTENTIONS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05270  01 OF 03  181642Z </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DOCUMENTS AND COMPUTER FILES SEIZED </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO MDC ADVISOR CLIVE PUZEY, THE RAID ON </p><p>THE OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION MDC CONCLUDED ON FRIDAY, </p><p>SEPTEMBER 15.  HE STATED THAT POLICE, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>AGENTS OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO), </p><p>SEIZED ALL OF THE MDC\'S PAPER FILES AND COMPUTER </p><p>DISKETTES, AND DOWNLOADED ALL OF THE PARTY\'S COMPUTER </p><p>FILES.  INCLUDED IN THE SEIZED INFORMATION, PUZEY SAID, </p><p>WERE THE PARTY\'S MEMBERSHIP LISTS, FINANCIAL RECORDS, </p><p>STRATEGIES FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND FOR </p><p>THEIR LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS, AND ALL THE EVIDENCE COLLECTED ON THE MURDERS </p><p>AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT VIOLENCE COMMITTED DURING THE PRE- </p><p>ELECTION PERIOD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) LATE ON SEPTEMBER 15, POLOFF SPOKE WITH SEKAYI </p><p>HOLLAND, THE MDC\'S SECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS </p><p>AND UNSUCCESSFUL PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE.  HOLLAND WAS </p><p>PRESENT AT THE MDC\'S EASTGATE OFFICE AND PROVIDED AN </p><p>ACCOUNT OF THE SECOND RAID BY POLICE AND CIO OFFICERS. </p><p>HOLLAND REPORTED THAT EARLY IN THE MORNING ON SEPTEMBER 15 </p><p>THE POLICE ORDERED EVERYONE OUT OF THE BUILDING BUT, AS THE </p><p>MOST SENIOR MDC OFFICIAL PRESENT, HOLLAND REFUSED TO LEAVE. </p><p>SHE REPORTED THAT THE POLICE, ACCOMPANIED BY THE CIO, </p><p>PROCEEDED TO USE RAMMING RODS TO BREAK DOWN THE DOORS TO </p><p>SEVERAL OFFICES, INCLUDING THAT OF MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI.  THE OFFICERS TOOK THE WHOLE DAY TO REMOVE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05270  01 OF 03  181642Z </p><p>VIRTUALLY ALL THE PAPER AND COMPUTER FILES.  THE CIO </p><p>OFFICERS THREATENED TO TAKE HOLLAND TO THEIR HEADQUARTERS, </p><p>BUT DECIDED NOT TO UPON LEAVING AT THE END OF THE DAY. </p><p>HOLLAND WAS SHAKEN, BUT OTHERWISE UNHARMED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN A MEETING ON SEPTEMBER 18 WITH THE AMBASSADOR, </p><p>DCM, AND POLOFF, MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE AND </p><p>MDC MP (AND SHADOW FOREIGN MINISTER) TENDAI BITI PROVIDED </p><p>ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE RAID.  ACCORDING TO NCUBE, IT </p><p>WAS CLEAR THAT THE GRENADE ATTACK ON MDC HEADQUARTERS </p><p>EARLIER IN THE WEEK HAD BEEN A PRETEXT FOR THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO GET ITS HANDS ON LISTS OF MDC PATRONS AND STRATEGIES. </p><p>THE MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL AFFIRMED THAT, DURING THE RAID, </p><p>THE POLICE AND CIO AGENTS APPEARED TO BE MOST INTERESTED </p><p>IN THE DOCUMENTS AND COMPUTER FILES RELATING TO FINANCIAL </p><p>TRANSACTIONS AND THE MDC\'S FUNDING SOURCES.  THEY SEIZED, </p><p>INTER ALIA, A LETTER FROM MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE (IRI) CONCERNING IRI\'S </p><p>WORKSHOPS FOR NEW MDC MPS, A LETTER THANKING A DUTCH NGO </p><p>FOR PROVIDING ASSISTANCE, AND LETTERS OF CONGRATULATIONS </p><p>TO THE MDC FROM A VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS SENT AFTER THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NCUBE INSISTED THAT NONE OF THE SEIZED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8681 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05270  02 OF 03  181642Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------869A53  181643Z /38 </p><p>O 181644Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7134 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 005270 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/15/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOVERNMENT RESORTS TO HAM-FISTED INTIMIDATION </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>INFORMATION HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH "SECURITY-RELATED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05270  02 OF 03  181642Z </p><p>MATTERS."  HE REPORTED THAT THE GOZ HAD NOT OBTAINED ALL </p><p>THE COMPUTER FILES AT THE EASTGATE OFFICE, AS THE MDC </p><p>STAFF THERE HAD MANAGED QUICKLY TO SWITCH SOME OF THEIR </p><p>COMPUTERS WITH A SYMPATHETIC ARCHITECTURAL FIRM NEXT </p><p>DOOR.  THE PAPER FILES AND 21 COMPUTER DISKETTES WHICH </p><p>WERE TAKEN WERE RETURNED TO THE MDC ON SATURDAY </p><p>AFTERNOON, SEPTEMBER 16, AFTER A HIGH COURT JUDGE ORDERED </p><p>THEM TO DO SO.  ACCORDING TO NCUBE, THE HIGH COURT ORDER </p><p>ALSO REQUIRED THAT THE MDC RECEIVE NOTIFICATION 48 HOURS </p><p>PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTS. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT SPARKED IT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) WHEN ASKED WHY THE POLICE HAD SPENT TWO DAYS </p><p>REMOVING FILES, SEKAYI HOLLAND SAID ZANU-PF WAS ALARMED </p><p>BY A RESURGENCE OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT RALLIES IN </p><p>TRADITIONALLY STRONG ZANU-PF TERRITORY IN RURAL AREAS. </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, SHE SAID 15,000 PEOPLE HAD TURNED OUT FOR </p><p>AN MDC RALLY IN MBERENGWA EAST, MIDLANDS PROVINCE, THE </p><p>PREVIOUS WEEKEND TO CELEBRATE THE "REOPENING" OF THE </p><p>MBERENGWA DISTRICT TO MDC SUPPORTERS.  MBERENGWA HAD BEEN </p><p>DECLARED A "NO-GO" AREA BY ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS DURING THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION CAMPAIGN, AND HAD BEEN </p><p>PARTICULARLY HARD-HIT BY PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE, ACCORDING </p><p>TO HOLLAND.  (COMMENT:  IT IS A STRETCH TO LINK THE RAID </p><p>OF THE MDC OFFICES IN HARARE TO AN MDC RALLY IN MIDLANDS. </p><p>HOWEVER, HOLLAND WAS CLEARLY FRIGHTENED BY ONGOING </p><p>THREATS AGAINST HER LIFE FROM ZANU-PF, AND THIS MAY HAVE </p><p>EXAGGERATED HER RESPONSE TO THE MDC RAIDS. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05270  02 OF 03  181642Z </p><p>8  (C) TENDAI BITI SURMISED THAT THE RECENT SERVING OF </p><p>LEGAL PAPERS, INITIATED BY MDC MEMBERS, ON PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE IN NEW YORK LIKELY EMBARRASSED HIM AND LED HIM TO </p><p>RETALIATE.  IN ADDITION, BITI CONTINUED, THE GOZ HAD </p><p>SERIOUSLY UNDERESTIMATED THE MDC\'S ABILITY TO PLAY AN </p><p>EFFECTIVE ROLE IN PARLIAMENT. FACED WITH A SINKING </p><p>ECONOMY AND REGULAR CRITICISMS FROM THE MDC, MUGABE IS </p><p>INCREASINGLY DESPERATE AND ONE OF HIS FEW OPTIONS IS TO </p><p>COME AFTER THE MDC WITH STRONG-ARM TACTICS.  MUGABE, BITI </p><p>SAID, HAS ALWAYS USED VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AS AN </p><p>EFFECTIVE TACTIC.  NCUBE SURMISED THAT THE GOZ WAS FORCED </p><p>TO ACT OVERTLY AGAINST THE MDC BECAUSE THE CIO HAD BEEN </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL AT INFILTRATING THE PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  BITI EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE GOZ MIGHT CLAMP </p><p>DOWN ON SENIOR MDC LEADERS IN THE COMING WEEK, AS THE GOZ </p><p>DID IN THE EARLY 1980\'S WHEN IT PROSECUTED SENIOR ZAPU </p><p>OFFICIALS ON TRUMPED-UP WEAPONS CHARGES.   MINISTER OF </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS JOHN NKOMO IS SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS </p><p>PARLIAMENT ON SEPTEMBER 19 CONCERNING THE GRENADE ATTACK </p><p>AND THE POLICE/CIO RAIDS, AND THE MDC HAS HEARD HE MIGHT </p><p>LINK THE SENIOR-MOST MDC OFFICIALS TO ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE IMPORTATION OF WEAPONS.  BITI INSISTED THAT </p><p>SUCH CHARGES ARE LUDICROUS, AS HE DOES NOT EVEN POSSESS A </p><p>GUN. </p><p> </p><p>MDC\'S NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  NCUBE SAID THE MDC\'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE PLANS </p><p>TO MEET ON SEPTEMBER 20 TO CONSIDER NEXT STEPS.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05270  02 OF 03  181642Z </p><p>COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER LEGAL AND POLITICAL OPTIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACTIONS IN COURT </p><p>AND ORGANIZING A NATIONAL STRIKE.  BITI ADDED THAT THE </p><p>SUBSTANCE OF MINISTER NKOMO\'S SPEECH ON SEPTEMBER 19 </p><p>WOULD LIKELY DETERMINE THE MDC\'S FUTURE MOVES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT HAS HARASSED AND INTIMIDATED THE </p><p>MDC AT EVERY TURN SINCE ITS FOUNDING LAST YEAR.  FACED </p><p>WITH THE MDC\'S RISING POPULARITY IN THE AFTERMATH OF </p><p>FEBRUARY\'S CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM DEFEAT, AND THE </p><p>PROSPECT OF LOSING CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT, THE GOZ </p><p>UNLEASHED A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR FOCUSED ON MDC SUPPORTERS </p><p>AND CANDIDATES IN THE RUN UP TO THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THE OCCUPATIONS BY SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS, MOST OF WHOM ARE OWNED BY MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS, WERE A KEY ELEMENT IN THE GOZ\'S ELECTION </p><p>STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) LAST WEEK\'S RAID ON MDC OFFICES, AND THE GRENADE </p><p>ATTACK WHICH APPARENTLY SERVED AS A PRETEXT FOR IT, WAS </p><p>THE LATEST, AND PERHAPS MOST SINISTER, CHAPTER IN THIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8683 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05270  03 OF 03  181643Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------869A5B  181643Z /38 </p><p>O 181644Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7135 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 005270 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/15/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOVERNMENT RESORTS TO HAM-FISTED INTIMIDATION </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN.  SPECULATION IS RIFE HERE ON WHAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05270  03 OF 03  181643Z </p><p>MAY HAVE BEEN THE PRECIPITATING EVENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACTION.  THE BOTTOM LINE, THOUGH, IS THAT THE MDC IS </p><p>GAINING STRENGTH AND IS SUBJECTING THE GOZ TO CRITICISM, </p><p>CALLS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY, AND PUBLIC SCRUTINY TO WHICH IT </p><p>IS UNACCUSTOMED.  THE OPPOSITION PARTY NOW POSES A VERY </p><p>REAL THREAT TO MUGABE\'S HOLD ON POWER (THE MDC WILL SWEEP </p><p>MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR AND LIKELY </p><p>WOULD WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IF IT WERE HELD TODAY </p><p>AND WERE HALF-WAY FAIR AND FREE), AND HE AND HIS CRONIES </p><p>WILL DO ALL THEY CAN TO MINIMIZE THAT THREAT.  IN A SMALL </p><p>PRIVATE LUNCHEON ATTENDED BY FOUR GOVERNMENT MINISTERS </p><p>AND OTHER DIPLOMATS ON SEPTEMBER 15, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED </p><p>THE REASONS FOR THE GOZ ACTION AGAINST THE MDC.  THE </p><p>MINISTERS WERE ALL SILENT, WITH NOT A SINGLE ONE </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO JUSTIFY THE RAID. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) IT IS APPARENT TO US NOW THAT THE GOZ (ZANU-PF) </p><p>NOT ONLY HAS NO INTENTION OF WORKING WITH THE MDC, BUT </p><p>WILL RESORT TO VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION TO TRY TO </p><p>RECOVER GROUND IT HAS LOST TO ITS UPSTART RIVAL.  IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR, THOUGH, HOW FAR THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO GO, </p><p>BUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY TRY TO LINK </p><p>THE MDC LEADERSHIP TO ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES -- AND THUS </p><p>ARREST THEM -- IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING.  AS BITI </p><p>MENTIONED, THE GOZ UNDERTOOK A SIMILAR APPROACH IN THE </p><p>1980\'S IN ELIMINATING ZAPU AS A VIABLE OPPOSITION PARTY. </p><p>WE HAVE KNOWN THE MDC LEADERS FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND </p><p>FIND IT EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT ANY OF THEM WOULD BE </p><p>INVOLVED IN IMPORTING WEAPONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05270  03 OF 03  181643Z </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
