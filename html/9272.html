<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001675 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, IZ, PREL, PTER, YM, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: NO IRAQI GOVERNMENT ASSETS IN YEMEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 186972 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by A/DCM S. Alexander for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Deputy Minister of Finance Ahmed Ghaleb and External </p><p>Relations Director Ibrahim al-Nahari told Pol/econoff on July </p><p>7 that there were no/no Iraqi government assets in Yemen in </p><p>response to reftel demarche.  Al-Nahari explained that the </p><p>only Iraqi Government assets in Yemen were several cargo </p><p>boats moored in Aden harbor during the 1991 Gulf War. </p><p>However, al-Nahari said that these boats became a liability </p><p>to the people of Yemen, and a Yemeni court case awarded 8 </p><p>million USD from Iraq  to the ROYG to compensate for their </p><p>upkeep. Having gained possession through the court case, the </p><p>ROYG sold the boats to Jordan at a two million dollar loss. </p><p>Therefore, the ROYG believes that the Iraqis owe the people </p><p>of Yemen the two million dollars. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SN/F) Turning to non-government Iraqi assets, Al-Nahari </p><p>stated that the one Iraqi owned bank in Yemen, the Raffadin </p><p>bank, only holds private citizens\' funds. Referring to U/S </p><p>Taylor\'s April 1 call to Central Bank Sub-Governor for </p><p>Control Mr. Abdullah Ulafi, al-Nahari said that the ROYG had </p><p>already told the Treasury Department that only private funds </p><p>are held at the Raffadin bank. Ghaleb added that he believed </p><p>that Raffadin only holds about 20 million Riyals (about </p><p>110,00 USD at the 07/09/03 exchange rate) in its reserves. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Al-Nahari said that an official response would be </p><p>sent by fax to Treasury Secretary Snow shortly. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
