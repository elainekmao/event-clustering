<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 244793 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING BAGHDAD 04258 DTD JULY 26, 1990 SENT ACTION </p><p>STATE, INFO KUWAIT, ARAB LEAGUE COLLECTIVE, BEING REPEATED </p><p>FOR YOUR INFO: </p><p> </p><p>QUOTE: </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 04258 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EPET, KU, US, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ IS NOT BLINKING </p><p> </p><p>REF: BAGHDAD 4210 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  IT IS IRAQI "RIGHTS," INCLUDING TO </p><p>RUMAYLA OIL, WHICH PUSHES VISITING MEDIA FOR VISITING </p><p>MUBARAK INTO SECOND PLACE IN THE JULY 24 </p><p>HEADLINES.  KUWAITI LEADERS ARE URGED TO OUST </p><p>THEIR FOREIGN MINISTER FOR PRO-U.S. POLICIES </p><p>AND THE UAE IS OFFICIALLY LABELED A </p><p>"CONSPIRATOR" WITH THE U.S. AGAINST THE ARABS. </p><p>IRAQ INSERTS IN GENEVA ITS VIEW THAT OIL SHOULD </p><p>BE "NOT LESS THAN USD 25" AND CLAIMS THE SAG AGREES. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED IRAQI PRESS ON </p><p>JULY 25 GAVE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S </p><p>THREE-HOUR VISIT THE PREVIOUS DAY SMALL </p><p>HEADLINES, A FRONT PAGE PHOTO, AN UNINFORMATIVE </p><p>REPORT ON INSIDE PAGES, AND NO EDITORIAL COMMENT. </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE SYG KLIBI\'S PRESENCE RECEIVED </p><p>VIRTUALLY NO PRESS ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BY CONTRAST, THE PRESS GAVE A RED BANNER TO </p><p>FONMIN TARIQ AZIZ\' ASSERTION (IN HIS SECOND </p><p>LETTER TO ARAB LEAGUE SYG--REFTEL) THAT THE </p><p>RUMAYLA OIL FIELD IS IRAQI "BY NAME AND TERRITORY." </p><p>(WE PRESUME THIS WAS SADDAM\'S MESSAGE TO MUBARAK.) </p><p>TEXT OF AZIZ\' JULY 21 LETTER (FBIS JN2407093790) </p><p>AND THAT OF DEPUTY PRIMIN SA\'DUN HAMMADI TO KUWAITI </p><p>RULER (FBIS JN2407102990) ARE BOTH PRINTED IN FULL IN </p><p>ARABIC AND ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS, AND ARE SUMMARIZED </p><p>IN REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE GOI IS CONTINUING ITS PUBLIC ATTACK ON </p><p>KUWAIT AND ITS RULERS.  FONMIN AZIZ, IN A </p><p>STATEMENT TO REPORTERS JULY 24, REJECTFD THE GOK\'S </p><p>PROPOSAL THAT THE BORDER DISPUTE GO TO </p><p>ARBITRATION AND SUGGESTED INSTEAD THAT THE PROBLEM </p><p>BE SOLVED BILATERALLY.  FURTHER, HE CALLED ON THE </p><p>KUWAITI LEADERSHIP TO EXPEL THE "CIRCLES OF </p><p>CONSPIRACY" (I.E., THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>OVERPRODUCTION AND FOR THE PRO-U.S. POLICY), </p><p>DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE CONSPIRACY AND EXPEL </p><p>CONSPIRATORS FROM DECISION MAKING POSITIONS (A </p><p>TRANSPARENT CALL FOR THE REMOVAL OF KUWAITI FONMIN </p><p>SABAHAL-AHMAD). </p><p> </p><p>6.  EDITORIALS ALL CONCENTRATE ON ATTACKING KUWAIT </p><p>AND ITS RULERS, REITERATING THE GOI\'S EARLIER </p><p>CLAIMS AND ADDING A FEW NEW TWISTS.  "ATH-THAWRA\'S" </p><p>PAGE ONE MAIN EDITORIAL ACCUSES THE KUWAITI RULERS </p><p>OF BEING "LIARS, THIEVES AND U-S. AGENTS."  ITS </p><p>OTHER FRONT PAGE EDITORIAL, BY A LIBYAN, CHARGES </p><p>THAT THE KUWAITIS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST </p><p>PAN-ARABISM, ALIGNED WITH FOREIGNERS AND IMPORTED </p><p>ASIAN WORKERS, THEREBY EXPELLING PALESTINIANS </p><p>AND EGYPTIANS.  A  PAGE TWO EDITORIAL CLAIMS THAT </p><p>THE ONLY SOLIDARITY THE KUWAITIS UNDERSTAND IS </p><p>THAT OF AMASSING MONEY IN SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS </p><p>THROUGH A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE ARAB NATTON. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. NAVAL ACTIVITY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  ALL PAPERS HIGHLIGHT OFFICIAL GOI SPOKESMAN\'S </p><p>COMMENTS ON THE PENTAGON STATEMENT THAT THE U.S. </p><p>AND UAE NAVIES ARE UNDERTAKING A JOINT OPERATION. </p><p>"THE CONSPIRATORS ARE SEARCHING FOR PRETEXTS AND </p><p>COVERS TO MAKE THE PRESENCE OF THE U.S. FLEET ON </p><p>ACCEPTABLE FACT IN THE REGION" IS ONE HEADLINE. </p><p>"THE CONSPIRATORS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED PUBLICLY FOR </p><p>CONSPIRING AGAINST IRAQ AND THE ARAB NATION" RUNS </p><p>A SUB-HEADLINE.  (COMMENT:  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO </p><p>THE "SPOKESMAN" WAS, WHETHER FROM THE MFA, </p><p>PRESIDENCY OR MINDEF.) </p><p> </p><p>OIL USD 25 A BARREL </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  JULY 25 PRESS ALSO HEADLINES PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>OF IRAQI OILMIN SHALABI ON HIS DEPARTURE TO ATTEND </p><p>THE OPEC MEETING IN GENEVA-  SHALABI REPORTEDLY SAID </p><p>THE OPEC MEMBERS FEEL THE NEED TO IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TAKE MEASURES TO INCREASE THE PRICE OF OIL.  THE </p><p>MAJORITY SUPPORT IRAQ\'S POSITION.  PRICES SHOULD BE </p><p>"NOT LESS THAN USD 25 PER BARREL THIS YEAR," SHALABI </p><p>TOLD REPORTERS, AND WHEN THEY REACH THAT LEVEL, OPEC </p><p>SHOULD DISCUSS CEILINGS AND QUOTAS SO THAT THE PRICE </p><p>WILL RISE TO USD 30.  THE IRAQI PRESS ALSO CLAIMS </p><p>THAT SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA AND GABON HAVE PUBLICLY </p><p>SUPPORTED IRAQ\'S POSITION.  U/S HAMDUN TOLD US JULY 25 </p><p>THAT THE SAUDIS WANT USD 25, ALTHOUGH IT WAS </p><p>INR\'S UNDERSTANDING ON JULY 24 THAT SAG BELIEVES </p><p>USD 25 IS TOO HIGH (STATE 242085). </p><p> </p><p>SADDAM LOBBIES THE ARAB LEAGUE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE MEDIA JULY 25 ALSO HEADLINED MISSIONS BY </p><p>IRIRAQI CABINET MINISTERS BEARING MESSAGES FROM </p><p>SADDAM TO FELLOW ARAB LEAGUE MEMBERS.  THE </p><p>MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR WENT TO BAHRAIN, QATAR </p><p>AND OMAN.  (AN OMANI COLLEAGUE TELLS US THE GOI </p><p>DID NOT/NOT BOTHER TO INFORM HIS EMBASSY THAT A </p><p>SPECIAL EMISSARY WAS ON HIS WAY TO MUSCAT.)  THE </p><p>MINISTER OF TRANSPORT HEADED FOR MOROCCO, </p><p>MAURITANIA, TUNISIA (AND THE PRO).  WE PRESUME </p><p>THE GOI DECIDED IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO SEND AN </p><p>EMISSARY TO LIBYA BECAUSE LIBYA HAS PUBLICLY </p><p>SUPPORTED IRAQ\'S POSITION ON OIL PRICING AND </p><p>KUWAIT.  AN ALGERIAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL WAS NOT </p><p>SURPRISED THE GOI DID NOT SEND ANYONE TO ALGIERS: </p><p>THE GOA ALSO WANTS AN OIL PRICE RISE.  AND THE </p><p>MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE WAS SENT TO SUDAN, </p><p>SOMALIA AND DJIBOUTI.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF </p><p>SYRIA AND LEBANON, THE GOI HAS BEEN IN CONTACT </p><p>WITH ALL OTHER AL MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>SOVIET VISITOR </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. PRESS ALSO COVERS--GIVING FRONT PAGE PHOTO--TO </p><p>CALL BY SOVIET MINISTER OF MILITARY INDUSTRIALIZATION </p><p>ON SADDAM.  AGAIN, NO DETAILS WERE GIVEN OF THE </p><p>DISCUSSION.  WE NOTE THAT SADDAM HAD CHANGED FROM </p><p>HIS FRENCH-TAILORED CIVILIAN SUIT, IN WHICH HE MET </p><p>MUBARAK, BACK INTO BA\'TH PARTY UNIFORM TO MEET THE </p><p>RUSSIAN.  HUSAYN KAMIL, MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND </p><p>MILITARY INDUSTRIALIZATION, ALSO ATTENDED THE MEETING. </p><p>FONMIN AZIZ DID NOT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  ON THE EVE OF THE OPEC MEETING, THE GOI IS </p><p>DEFINITELY NOT/NOT BLINKING.  RATHER, THE TONE OF </p><p>ITS ATTACK ON KUWAIT IS EVEN SHRILLER AND MORE </p><p>PERSONAL AGAINST THE KUWAITI RULING FAMILY THAN </p><p>EVER BEFORE.  EDITORIALS ARE BEGINNING TO PLAY </p><p>TO ARAFAT\'S ANGER WITH THE KUWAITIS FOR EXPELLING </p><p>PALESTINIANS AND FONMIN AZIZ\' COMMENT ABOUT THE </p><p>EXPELLING OF THE CONSPIRATORS IS AN OFFICIAL ATTACK </p><p>ON THE KUWAITI ROYAL FAMILY.  THE GOI IS NOW TRYING </p><p>TO STIR UP THE PALESTINIANS AGAINST THE KUWAITIS </p><p>AND APPEALING TO ARAB NATIONALIST ELEMENTS AGAINST </p><p>THEIR RULERS. </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p>UNQUOTE </p><p> </p><p>EAGLEBURGER </p><p></p></div>
