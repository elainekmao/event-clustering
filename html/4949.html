<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000031 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, YM, EAC </p><p>SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING - 4 JANUARY 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 04060 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: The Ambassador convened an EAC </p><p>meeting on January 4, 2003, to assess recent threat </p><p>information that emerged from the investigation of the Dec. </p><p>30 Jibla Hospital shooting (see reftel) and adopt measures to </p><p>enhance security for Yemen-based American citizens.  Key </p><p>offices and personnel represented at the meeting included: </p><p>DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, RMO, ORCA, DAO, OMC, SOC </p><p>YEMEN, FPD and FBI.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador held an EAC meeting on January 4 </p><p>to analyze investigative findings known thus far about the </p><p>December 30 Jibla Hospital shooting and how this information </p><p>can be used to bolster security for Americans who reside and </p><p>work in Yemen.  FBI conveyed that the perpetrator, Abd </p><p>Abdulrazak Mohammed Kamel, was motivated to kill Dr. Martha </p><p>Myers primarily because he was told of her success in </p><p>converting numerous Yemenis from Islam to Christianity.  FBI </p><p>emphasized Kamel\'s focus on killing proselytizers, relaying </p><p>that Kamel confessed he has nothing against Americans, </p><p>Christians or Jews.  Nevertheless, Kamel added that U.S. </p><p>Middle East policy is partly to blame for his actions, based </p><p>on the U.S. military presence in the Red Sea and Arabian </p><p>Peninsula and support for Israel. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  EAC discussed the nature and extent of the </p><p>linkage between Kamel and Ali Al-Jarala (who assassinated the </p><p>Deputy Secretary General of the Yemeni Socialist Party on </p><p>December 28), focusing on the potential risk facing the </p><p>American community.  The Ambassador concluded that the most </p><p>prominent targets are Yemeni secularist politicians, </p><p>missionaries and members of the U.S. military.  However, he </p><p>placed great importance on determining which other </p><p>individuals may be in danger, tasking POLM, RSO and FBI to </p><p>request further information from the PSO and Ministry of </p><p>Interior. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  EAC identified specific organizations whose </p><p>members and employees may be vulnerable because they are </p><p>either U.S. citizens, organizations with U.S. affiliations, </p><p>or organizations associated with religious groups or </p><p>practices.  The list includes: Yemen America Language </p><p>Institute (part of the U.S. Embassy); United Nations; the </p><p>NGOs CARE, Amideast and National Democratic Institute; Sanaa </p><p>International School; Adra (a faith-based Christian USAID </p><p>contractor); a Protestant-run eye clinic; and Sanaa-based </p><p>church services held in private residences.  The Ambassador </p><p>assigned particular EAC members to liaise with appropriate </p><p>organization leaders to advise of the threat and consult on </p><p>the implementation of additional security practices.  FPD </p><p>will return to Jibla to conduct a security review for the </p><p>benefit of Americans who choose to remain. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  The meeting ended with concern about any </p><p>potential danger associated with unofficial travel within </p><p>Yemen.  EAC concluded that unofficial travel will be approved </p><p>on a case by case basis. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Ambassador will meet with American wardens, </p><p>including representatives of groups noted para. 4, to share </p><p>information on Jibla attack and encourage self-assessments of </p><p>vulnerabilities and heightened security. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
