(U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- </p><p>Please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Preparations for the arrival of the </p><p>second round of the USG-funded Quick Reaction Demining </p><p>Force (QRDF) are well in gear.  The GSL is proving very </p><p>helpful in arranging for the QRDF\'s return.  Mission </p><p>expects that the team will work in the same war-torn </p><p>region of Jaffna as last year\'s team.  The QRDF\'s </p><p>efforts will serve to underscore continued strong </p><p>support by the U.S. for the peace process.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In preparation for the expected March 19 arrival </p><p>of a USG-funded humanitarian demining (QRDF) team in Sri </p><p>Lanka, an advance team, led by PM/HDP Senior Adviser </p><p>Harry McCloy, has begun coordination efforts with the </p><p>Sri Lankan government.  (Note:  This is the second QRDF </p><p>team assigned to Sri Lanka.  A QRDF team operated in the </p><p>northern district of Jaffna from April through October </p><p>last year.)  Since its arrival late last week, the </p><p>advance team has been in close touch with the military, </p><p>civilian offices involved in demining within the GSL, </p><p>and international organizations conducting demining work </p><p>in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The advance team found GSL interlocutors to be </p><p>extremely helpful in coordinating the arrival of the </p><p>QRDF team.  (Note:  The full team will include about 20 </p><p>Mozambican nationals and four dogs.)  The advance team </p><p>also found government officials responsive to its </p><p>concerns about assigning an appropriate task for the </p><p>QRDF.  Priority areas for demining in the Jaffna </p><p>Peninsula are mainly set by the Government Affairs (GA) </p><p>office in Jaffna city, along with other actors.  The </p><p>GA\'s representative, P. Sundarampillai, toured five </p><p>different sites with the advance team and military </p><p>representatives in the Jaffna area, March 12-13.  All of </p><p>the parties involved in determining the site -- the GA\'s </p><p>office, MoD, the advance team, etc. -- agreed that a </p><p>site near the devastated town of Chavakachcheri was </p><p>superior to the rest for purposes of the QRDF.  (Note: </p><p>This site is adjacent to land in an area called </p><p>Sarasalai that the first QRDF team demined last year. </p><p>To highlight the QRDF\'s activities, the Deputy Secretary </p><p>visited this area during his August 2002 visit to Sri </p><p>Lanka.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The advance team also attended a "National </p><p>Steering Committee Mine Action" meeting on March 13 to </p><p>review the upcoming arrival of the QRDF.  (Note:  The </p><p>"National Steering Committee" is a government- </p><p>coordinated body that brings together public and private </p><p>groups involved in demining.)  The meeting was </p><p>constructive, with the advance team concluding that the </p><p>QRDF\'s planned activities fit in well with Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>national demining priorities, as well as efforts by </p><p>international and local NGO\'s.  In fact, NGO </p><p>representatives expressed strong support for the return </p><p>of the QRDF. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT:  Mission looks forward to the imminent </p><p>arrival of the full QRDF team.  As with the efforts of </p><p>the first QRDF team, the work this team will do will </p><p>underline strong U.S. support for the peace process, aid </p><p>in the safe return of displaced persons, and foster </p><p>goodwill among Sri Lankans toward the U.S.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) PM/HDP Senior Adviser Harry McCloy did not have </p><p>the opportunity to review this message. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
