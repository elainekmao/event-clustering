<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008357 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF/RA FOR NICOLE PEACOCK, USAID/AFR/SD/DG FOR MELISSA </p><p>ROSSER, DRL, USAID/AFR/DP, NAIROBI FOR AID </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, EAID, XA, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: DHRF ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT -- FY 2000 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 216032 </p><p>     B. KINSHASA 6473 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. THIS IS EMBASSY KINSHASA\'S ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT FOR THE </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS FUND (DHRF).  EMBASSY\'S FUNDING </p><p>REQUEST FOR 2001 PROJECTS FOLLOWS SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. POST REQUESTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE </p><p>SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CONGO WHEN EVALUATING RECENT </p><p>DHRF PROJECTS.  ADMINISTERING THESE FUNDS HAS BEEN A </p><p>CHALLENGE GIVEN THAT IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE EMBASSY HAS </p><p>UNDERGONE TWO WARS, TWO EVACUATIONS, FOUR SELF-HELP/DHRF </p><p>COORDINATORS, AND THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE EMBASSY.  AS A </p><p>RESULT, IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO CLOSE THE BOOKS ON SEVERAL </p><p>PROJECTS FROM 1996 AND 1997, PROJECTS THAT BEGAN PRIOR TO THE </p><p>EVACUATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT </p><p>RECEIVED FUNDING LOST THEIR RECORDS, WHICH MADE ACCOUNTING </p><p>VERY DIFFICULT.  HOWEVER, EMBASSY HAS WORKED VERY HARD TO </p><p>CLOSE OUT THESE PROJECTS AND IS PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE </p><p>HAVE SUBMITTED TO USAID ALL DOCUMENTS NECESSARY TO CLOSE OUT </p><p>PROJECTS PRIOR TO 1999. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. WE NOTE THAT IN 1998 THERE WERE NO DHRF PROJECTS IN THE </p><p>DRC BECAUSE THE EMBASSY WAS CLOSED TEMPORARILY.  DUE TO LOCAL </p><p>BANKING RESTRICTIONS AND INITIAL DIFFICULTIES GETTING FUNDS </p><p>RELEASED TO PROJECT RECIPIENTS, EMBASSY HAS ALSO EXTENDED THE </p><p>CONTRACTS OF 1999 PROJECTS.  TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROJECTS GO </p><p>FORWARD SUCCESSFULLY, WE PLAN TO PAY VENDORS DIRECTLY FOR </p><p>MATERIALS AND SERVICES THAT DHRF RECIPIENTS NEED IN ORDER TO </p><p>CARRY OUT THEIR ACTIVITIES, THUS AVOIDING LOCAL BANKS </p><p>ENTIRELY.  EMBASSY IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH USAID TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT FUNDS ARE RE-ISSUED DIRECTLY TO VENDORS SELECTED BY DHRF </p><p>RECIPIENTS.  WE INTEND TO FUND ALL 2000 AND 2001 PROJECTS IN </p><p>THE SAME WAY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. DHRF FY 2000 ACTIVITIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FUNDING FOR 2000 PROJECTS HAS NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED.  EMBASSY </p><p>AND RECIPIENTS SIGNED CONTRACTS FOR 2000 PROJECTS ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 22, 2000, AS REPORTED REF B. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NAME OF GRANTEE: CAMPAGNE POUR LA PAIX DURABLE </p><p>DHRF GRANT NUMBER: DHR-660-00-01 </p><p>SHORT DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: SEMINARS, OPEN FORUMS, PLAYS, </p><p>SKITS ON DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE. PUBLISHING AND </p><p>DISTRIBUTING THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT IN OCCUPIED AREA OF THE DRC. </p><p>AMOUNT OBLIGATED: USD 20,000 </p><p>UNLIQUIDATED BALANCE: USD 20,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NAME OF GRANTEE: GROUPE JEREMIE </p><p>DHRF GRANT NUMBER: DHR-660-00-02 </p><p>SHORT DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: PROMOTING COMMUNICATION ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN ALL OF THE DRC INCLUDING </p><p>REBEL-CONTROLLED TERRITORIES. MONITOR REPORTING ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS CONDITIONS IN EASTERN CONGO, PUBLISH FINDINGS. </p><p>AMOUNT OBLIGATED: USD 20,000 </p><p>UNLIQUIDATED BALANCE: USD 20,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NAME OF GRANTEE: LES KAMIKAZES </p><p>DHRF GRANT NUMBER: DHR-600-00-03 </p><p>SHORT DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: THEATER ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE </p><p>DEMOCRACY, PEACE AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  FOLLOWING THE </p><p>PERFORMANCE, WILL LEAD DISCUSSIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE </p><p>SENSITIVITY TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY VALUES. </p><p>AMOUNT OBLIGATED: USD 20,000 </p><p>UNLIQUIDATED BALANCE: USD 20,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. OUR DHRF SUCCESS STORY COMES FROM 1997, AS 1999 AND 2000 </p><p>PROJECTS ARE PENDING.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREEMENT </p><p>DHRF-96-660-07, SIGNED WITH THE EMBASSY ON SEPTEMBER 25, </p><p>1996, "LIGUE DES ELECTEURS" CONDUCTED TRAINING SEMINARS FOR </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS AND DEMOCRACY "ANIMATORS" DURING 1997 IN </p><p>SIX CITIES: MATADI AND LUOZI IN BAS CONGO, KIKWIT IN </p><p>BANDUNDU, MBUJI-MAYI IN EASTERN KASAI, KANANGA IN WESTERN </p><p>KASAI, AND KINSHASA.  THE NGO TRAINED 75 OBSERVERS AND </p><p>ANIMATORS PER WORKSHOP USING DOCUMENTS SUCH AS THE UNIVERSAL </p><p>DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  ELECTION TRAINING FOCUSED ON </p><p>GATHERING CENSUS FIGURES, MANAGING POLLING STATIONS, AND </p><p>TABULATION METHODS.  EMBOFFS AND THE DHRF COORDINATOR </p><p>ATTENDED THE KINSHASA WORKSHOP AND WERE VERY IMPRESSED WITH </p><p>THE QUALITY OF THE TRAINING.  ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NO </p><p>ELECTIONS SINCE KABILA TOOK POWER IN 1997, THE TRAINEES WILL </p><p>PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS AND DEMOCRATIC </p><p>INITIATIVES IN THE CONGO.  FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE </p><p>WORKSHOPS, LIGUE DES ELECTEURS PROVIDED EXCELLENT REPORTING </p><p>TO THE EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. DHRF PROJECTS IN THE CONGO ARE MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN </p><p>EVER BEFORE.  CONGO HAS EXPERIENCED SERIOUS AND EXTENSIVE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS, VIOLATIONS </p><p>THAT CONTINUE TODAY.  EMBASSY RELIES ON THE MANY HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ACTIVISTS WHO DOCUMENT THESE VIOLATIONS AND WORK TOWARD </p><p>IMPROVING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE CONGO.  MOREOVER, </p><p>THERE IS A SERIOUS NEED FOR PROJECTS THAT EDUCATE THE </p><p>POPULATION WITH REGARD TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, IN LIGHT OF </p><p>THE EXPECTED INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE.  DESPITE THE MANY </p><p>RECENT CHALLENGES TO ADMINISTERING DHRF PROJECTS IN CONGO, WE </p><p>REQUEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT GIVE EVERY CONSIDERATION TO </p><p>FUNDING 2001 PROJECTS (SUBMITTED SEPTEL), AS THE RECIPIENTS </p><p>PERFORM FUNCTIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE WORK OF THE </p><p>EMBASSY AND OUR MISSION OBJECTIVES IN THE COUNTRY. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
