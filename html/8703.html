A date for the third round of peace talks remains </p><p>elusive, as negotiations appear to take a back seat to the </p><p>controversy surrounding the appointments of new cabinet </p><p>members in the Government of Nepal (GON) (Reftel).  Senior- </p><p>level Maoists have intensified public rhetoric about foreign </p><p>interference in Nepal, particularly against the U.S.  Maoist </p><p>cadres remain active, extorting food and money, abducting </p><p>civilians, including students, and openly conducting </p><p>military training and recruitment efforts.  The Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) continues to provide humanitarian assistance to </p><p>regions hit hardest by the insurgency.  Victims of the </p><p>insurgency meanwhile have stepped up their demands to be </p><p>heard, threatening to resort to violence if necessary. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>PEACE TALKS REMAIN STALLED </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2.  No date has been set for the third round of peace talks </p><p>amid the controversial change in Nepal\'s government </p><p>(Reftel).  Baburam Bhattarai, senior Maoist leader and head </p><p>of the Maoist negotiating team, however, reportedly declared </p><p>on June 9 that his party would not abandon the talks.  In an </p><p>earlier contradictory statement on June 8 Bhattarai </p><p>reportedly said that the hopes for continued peace talks </p><p>were diminishing due to "increasing activities of foreign </p><p>powers."  The Maoist ideologue continued his double speak </p><p>while addressing a program on June 12 attended by </p><p>politicians in support of a new constitution.  Bhattarai </p><p>threatened that his party would return to the jungle if the </p><p>Maoist demand for a constituent assembly was not obtained, </p><p>claiming that the King had undermined the existing </p><p>Constitution by appointing his confidant as Prime Minister. </p><p>STATUS OF GOVERNMENT\'S TEAM UNCLEAR </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>3.  On June 12 the local press reported that a new two- </p><p>member team of government negotiators had been formed.  Dr. </p><p>Prakash Chandra Lohani, Minister of Finance, and Kamal </p><p>Thapa, Minister of Communications, have been appointed </p><p>government negotiators for peace talks with the Maoists. </p><p>Minister Thapa told reporters that the GON will give top </p><p>priority to peace talks.  He also said that while a leader </p><p>of the government\'s team had not yet been appointed, he </p><p>himself would "coordinate with the Maoists and start talks </p><p>as soon as possible." </p><p>MAOIST LEADERS SPEW ANTI-AMERICAN RHETORIC </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  According to a vernacular newspaper, Ram Bahadur Thapa, </p><p>alias Badal, the Maoist military commander, declared on June </p><p>10 that "this time war would be directly with the American </p><p>army."  Badal, speaking at a meeting in Baglung District, </p><p>threatened that the Americans would be defeated as they were </p><p>in Vietnam, and asserted that America started war with the </p><p>Maoists by placing them on a terrorist list.  The senior- </p><p>level leader maintained that there was foreign influence </p><p>behind the change of government.  Dev Gurung, a politburo </p><p>member of the Maoist party, speaking in Palpa District on </p><p>June 11, also reportedly lambasted the U.S. Army, claiming </p><p>that over three hundred American military advisors were in </p><p>Nepal training Royal Nepal Army (RNA) soldiers, with the </p><p>intention of staging a military coup. </p><p> </p><p>CEASEFIRE NOT IMPEDING MAOISTS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  Despite a four-month ceasefire, life in many parts of </p><p>Nepal remains unchanged.  In the remote mid-western district </p><p>of Baglung, residents remain skeptical about the prospect of </p><p>peace.  Press accounts from the region report that the </p><p>Maoists are very active.  The insurgents reportedly are </p><p>openly conducting military training, distributing Maoist </p><p>literature, and hanging Maoist flags throughout the </p><p>district.  The insurgents also warn the villagers not to </p><p>attend the medical camps conducted by the RNA.  Similar </p><p>accounts have been reported from Palpa District as well, </p><p>with reports indicating Maoists openly carry guns, and have </p><p>severely beaten some residents. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Maoist cadres dressed in full combat uniform reportedly </p><p>have intensified their extortion campaigns in Saylan </p><p>District, forcing residents to "donate" food and money. </p><p>They have targeted their exactions at teachers, merchants </p><p>and other locals.  Reports from the region indicate that the </p><p>insurgents have also banned development projects, and forced </p><p>construction workers and technicians to desert a road </p><p>project.  Maoist cadres abducted three members of the Nepal </p><p>Reporter\'s Club in Kaski District on June 7, and also </p><p>abducted a father and son from Pyuthan District on June 6. </p><p>The insurgents reportedly took the father and son to be </p><p>tried in a so-called Maoist peoples\' court.  The All Nepal </p><p>Independent Students\' Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the </p><p>Maoist affiliated student organization, reportedly abducted </p><p>six teachers and a dozen students on June 5 in the western </p><p>district of Dailekh.  The abductees remain missing. </p><p> </p><p>7.  A report published on June 10 by the Informal Service </p><p>Sector, a local human rights organization, said the Maoists </p><p>have abducted over a hundred and thirty civilians since the </p><p>ceasefire was declared five months ago.  According to the </p><p>report, fifteen people also have been killed over the past </p><p>four months, and the Maoists were responsible for more than </p><p>half of those murders.  The National Human Rights Commission </p><p>(NHRC) has called on the Maoists and the GON to sign a human </p><p>rights agreement to ensure that violations of the ceasefire </p><p>stop.  The NHRC reportedly has sent a draft of the agreement </p><p>to both negotiation teams, but has received no response. </p><p> </p><p>RNA EXPANDS HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) continues its humanitarian </p><p>assistance in regions hit hardest by the Maoist insurgency. </p><p>The programs, which provide medical treatment and distribute </p><p>basic necessities, have been highly successful.  As a </p><p>result, the RNA has expanded the camps and joined with other </p><p>government organizations in a bid to reach twenty-four of </p><p>the most remote districts.  The RNA, along with the Armed </p><p>Police Force (APF) and local government organizations, </p><p>launched the new program on June 6 in the districts of </p><p>Baglung and Palpa, where 16,000 people were expected to seek </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p>VICTIMS OF INSURGENCY THREATEN VIOLENCE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  As victims come to grips with the hardships of </p><p>displacement, loss of loved ones, and other atrocities </p><p>resulting from the insurgency, they are also dealing with </p><p>the perceived lack of attention to their demands.  Ganesh </p><p>Chilwal, president of the Nepal Maoist Victims\' Association, </p><p>warned on June 10 that if the victims continued to be </p><p>ignored by both the GON and the Maoists, they would resort </p><p>to violence.  Chilwal said the victims would not attack </p><p>"helpless villagers as the Maoists did," but would go after </p><p>Maoist leaders like Baburam Bhattarai.  Chilwal claims the </p><p>insurgents have murdered almost two dozen people since the </p><p>ceasefire, and continue to rob and abduct innocent </p><p>civilians.  The victims are demanding compensation for lost </p><p>property, financial assistance for the families of murdered </p><p>security personnel, scholarships for orphans, and assistance </p><p>programs for widows. </p><p> </p><p>10.  An interaction was held on June 11 in Kalikot District </p><p>between Maoists and victims of the insurgency in that </p><p>region.  Many of the victims demanded that the insurgents </p><p>return stolen items and leave the people alone to "lead a </p><p>peaceful life."  In response to the victims\' litany of </p><p>complaints, which included being robbed, beaten, and </p><p>abducted, and witnessing the murders of family members, </p><p>Maoist leaders appeared to shrug off responsibility, </p><p>declaring, "we did not force you to vacate your homes." </p><p> </p><p>11.  In another disturbing report, "Meet Nepal," a local non- </p><p>governmental organization (NGO), states that over seventy- </p><p>five thousand girls have been driven from their homes by the </p><p>Maoist insurgency and are working in menial, low-paying </p><p>jobs.  The girls, many of whom are illiterate and unskilled, </p><p>flee their rural villages in search of better opportunities, </p><p>but ultimately end up working in "cabin" restaurants in </p><p>major cities, where prostitution is common.  The Kathmandu </p><p>Valley reportedly has close to three thousand cabin and </p><p>dance restaurants.  The NGO has started skill training </p><p>workshops in hopes of educating the girls to enable them to </p><p>secure respectable jobs. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST PRISONERS RELEASED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Seventeen Maoists detained in the Kapilavastu Jail </p><p>under suspicion of being involved in terrorist activities </p><p>were released on June 11 following orders from the Appellate </p><p>Court. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
