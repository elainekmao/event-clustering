<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 001870 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: FUTURE OF NIGERIA AIRWAYS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: The wetlease agreement of Nigeria Airways </p><p>Limited (NAL) with </p><p>Air Atlanta Icelandic (AAI) was set to expire on September </p><p>19, but was extended </p><p>at the last minute.  The Ministry of Aviation had hoped until </p><p>the last moment to </p><p>replace NAL with a new national carrier, Air Nigeria, through </p><p>a joint venture </p><p>agreement with the UK-based Airwing Aerospace Limited (AAL). </p><p>Because Nigeria </p><p>lacks ICAO\'s Category I safety status, however, NAL would not </p><p>have been able to </p><p>fly alone into the United States.  In addition, Air Nigeria </p><p>could not have begun </p><p>operations on September 20 because the U.S. Federal Aviation </p><p>Administration has </p><p>not received documentation from the new airline.  Moreover, </p><p>an inter-ministerial </p><p>committee formed to advise the GON on the legitimacy of the </p><p>proposed joint venture </p><p>has yet to begin deliberations.  Had NAL failed to extend its </p><p>current wetlease by </p><p>September 20, operations on the popular Lagos-New York route </p><p>would have been suspended. </p><p>The Ministry of Aviation has dodged that bullet, but still </p><p>has a politically difficult </p><p>row to hoe before Air Nigeria can lift off.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On September 17, Abuja-based ECON FSN Specialist met </p><p>with Tony Anufor, Special </p><p>Assistant to the Minister of Aviation, who asserted knowing </p><p>nothing about plans </p><p>to extend NAL\'s wetlease.  Anufor confirmed, however, that </p><p>preparations for the new </p><p>carrier have been put on hold pending the recommendation of </p><p>the inter-ministerial </p><p>committee that will review the proposed joint venture. </p><p>Initially, the Ministry had hoped </p><p>that Air Nigeria might have begun operating on September 20 </p><p>under the joint venture </p><p>agreement.  Under it, the GON\'s equity share would have been </p><p>51 percent, secured </p><p>through the liquidation of NAL assets.  Officials from the </p><p>Nigerian Civil Aviation </p><p>Authority (NCAA) informed EconOff that Airwing had planned on </p><p>Singapore Airways\' managing </p><p>the operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Early September 18, Chris Aligbe, Public Affairs </p><p>Manager for NAL, informed </p><p>Lagos-based EconOff that NAL intended to continue its </p><p>Lagos-New York operations </p><p>through an extension of NAL\'s actual wetlease.  NAL\'s </p><p>Managing Director hoped to </p><p>secure a deal with AAI within two days.  Aligbe expected the </p><p>extension would be </p><p>in effect until Air Nigeria receives GON approval of the </p><p>joint venture and acquires </p><p>FAA-approved equipment and crew.  Late September 18, Aligbe </p><p>informed EconOff that </p><p>Nigeria Airways had just extended its wetlease agreement with </p><p>Air Atlanta, presumably </p><p>until the issue about Air Nigeria is resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The future of the Air Nigeria deal remains </p><p>uncertain.  After hearing of complaints by the Bureau of </p><p>Public Enterprises, President Obasanjo established </p><p>a twelve-person committee to review the agreement.  Members </p><p>of the committee include </p><p>representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Finance, </p><p>Aviation, and the Bureau of </p><p>Public Enterprises (BPE).  The BPE argues that the Ministry </p><p>is challenging the </p><p>BPE\'s privatization authority.  Contacts report that the BPE </p><p>is engaged in discussions </p><p>to sell NAL to a South African group.  This issue will most </p><p>likely be reviewed by the </p><p>committee, whose deliberations were to have begun on </p><p>September 16, but were delayed </p><p>until September 20 owing to the ongoing voter registration. </p><p>Denying press reports that </p><p>the committee is investigating the Ministry of Aviation\'s </p><p>actions in the deal, the </p><p>Minister\'s Special Assistant characterized the accusations as </p><p>"evil schemes of people </p><p>who do not like (Minister Chikwe)." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment:  Even if President Obasanjo has signed off </p><p>on the joint venture agreement, as </p><p>Minister Chikwe contends in the press, Air Nigeria\'s future </p><p>is uncertain.  The inter- </p><p>ministerial committee must review the agreement to ensure </p><p>that it meets governmental </p><p>guidelines, and the BPE is likely to recommend against </p><p>approval.  End Comment. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
