FOLLOWING ARE THE REMARKS MADE BY AMBASSADOR GERALD </p><p>W. SCOTT UPON PRESENTATION OF HIS CREDENTIALS ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 16. </p><p> </p><p>QUOTE:  MR. CHAIRMAN:  I HAVE THE HONOR TO PRESENT TO </p><p>YOUR EXCELLENCY AS CHIEF OF STATE THE LETTER OF RECALL </p><p>OF MY PREDECESSOR AND WITH IT THE LETTER FROM MY </p><p>PRESIDENT ACCREDITING ME TO YOU AND TO THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>THE GAMBIA AS HIS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>I AM GREATLY HONORED BY THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND I WISH </p><p>TO ASSURE YOUR EXCELLENCY OF MY PERSONAL DESIRE TO </p><p>PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THE TIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>IN EXERCISING THIS RESPONSIBILITY I HOPE TO ACQUIRE A </p><p>WIDE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE GAMBIA AND TO </p><p>COME TO KNOW ITS PEOPLE -- WHOSE MARKED VIRTUE AND </p><p>FRIENDLY CHARACTER HAVE BEEN ATTESTED BY ALL TO WHOM I </p><p>HAVE SPOKEN.  BUT IT WILL BE MY SPECIAL DESIRE, </p><p>EXCELLENCY, TO FOSTER CLEAR AND HELPFUL COMMUNICATION </p><p>BETWEEN MY GOVERNMENT AND YOURS.  IN DOING SO, IT WILL </p><p>BE MY ENDEAVOR TO CONVEY MY GOVERNMENT\'S VIEWS WITH </p><p>ACCURACY AND TO REPORT FAITHFULLY THE VIEWS OF YOUR </p><p>EXCELLENCY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GAMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>IN SPITE OF THE BEST INTENTIONS OF MEN OF GOOD WILL, WE </p><p>LIVE IN A TROUBLED WORLD. THE REGION OF WEST AFRICA HAS </p><p>NOT ESCAPED THE FLAIL OF CIVIL WAR.  IT IS WITH A </p><p>SPECIAL FEELING OF RESPONSIBILITY, THEREFORE, THAT I </p><p>ARRIVE TO REPRESENT MY GOVERNMENT BEFORE YOU, THE LEADER </p><p>OF A NATION AT PEACE WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND A NATION </p><p>WHICH CAN ACT TO PROMOTE PEACE, STABILITY AND </p><p>RECONCILIATION IN THE REGION.  I WISH ESPECIALLY TO </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THE PRIVILEGE OF ASSISTING AT A KEY MOMENT </p><p>IN THE HISTORY OF THE GAMBIA AS GAMBIANS PROCEED IN THE </p><p>NEXT FEW MONTHS UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP TO ESTABLISH A NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTION AND A FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY.  IT IS THE </p><p>EARNEST HOPE OF MY GOVERNMENT THAT THIS TRANSITION WILL </p><p>LEAD TO AN ERA OF PEACE, PROSPERITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL </p><p>THE CITIZENS OF THE GAMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>MR. CHAIRMAN, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GAMBIA AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, EACH IN ITS </p><p>OWN WAY, SEEK THE GOOD OF ITS OWN PEOPLE AND OF THE </p><p>LARGER WORLD.  OUR COUNTRIES HAVE MANY GOALS IN COMMON </p><p>AND MANY AREAS IN WHICH WE CAN BE OF MUTUAL SUPPORT.  IT </p><p>IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL DISAGREE UPON OCCASION, BUT I </p><p>PLEDGE TO WEIGH CAREFULLY AND FULLY ANY VIEWS YOUR </p><p>EXCELLENCY OR YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S MINISTERS MAY OFFER. </p><p>AND SHOULD THERE BE A DIVERGENCE OF VIEW, IT WILL BE MY </p><p>ENDEAVOR TO ASSURE THAT THESE ARE COUCHED IN THE TERMS </p><p>OF RESPECT AND MODERATION THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO </p><p>EXCHANGES BETWEEN TWO NATIONS OF SUCH LONG-STANDING </p><p>FRIENDSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>MR. CHAIRMAN, WE ARE FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN AN ERA IN </p><p>WHICH THE FOSTERING OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT, </p><p>THE NURTURING OF RESPONSIBLE AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, </p><p>AND THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARE GOALS </p><p>UNIVERSALLY PROCLAIMED.  THE GAMBIA AND THE UNITED </p><p>STATES OF AMERICA BOTH WORK TOWARDS THESE OBJECTIVES. </p><p>AS WE DO SO, I BEG YOU TO COUNT ON THE SYMPATHY AND </p><p>COOPERATION OF MY GOVERNMENT.  AND I PARTICULARLY ASK </p><p>THAT YOU COUNT ON ME AND MY EMBASSY TO ASSIST IN </p><p>WHATEVER WAY IS APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT PROGRESS TOWARDS </p><p>THE MANY GOALS COMMON TO US BOTH.  END QUOTE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  RESPONSE BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AFPRC AND HEAD OF </p><p>STATE, CAPTAIN YAHYA A.J.J. JAMMEH: </p><p> </p><p>QUOTE:  MR. AMBASSADOR, IN ACCEPTING YOUR LETTERS OF </p><p>CREDENCE, PLEASE ALLOW ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR </p><p>APPOINTMENT AS AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND </p><p>PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  I ALSO </p><p>ACCEPT THE LETTERS OF RECALL OF YOUR PREDECESSOR. </p><p>I AM PARTICULARLY PLEASED THAT YOU ARE DETERMINED TO </p><p>PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THE TIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.  THE GAMBIA AND </p><p>THE UNITED STATES HAVE TRADITIONALLY ENJOYED DECADES OF </p><p>FRUITFUL AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONS.  IT IS OUR </p><p>SINCERE HOPE THAT SUCH COOPERATION WILL REMAIN THE BASIS </p><p>FOR STILL CLOSER TIES AND INTERACTIONS IN AS MANY AREAS </p><p>AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>MR. AMBASSADOR, I WELCOME YOUR INTENTION TO FOSTER </p><p>UNBIASED AND HELPFUL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>THE GAMBIA.  MAINTAINING OBJECTIVE LINES OF </p><p>COMMUNICATION IS AN IMPORTANT PREREQUISITE IN THE </p><p>CORDIAL AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THE MULTIFACETED </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN ANY TWO COUNTRIES.  ON THE CONTRARY, </p><p>BIASED AND SENSATIONAL REPORTING DELIBERATELY AIMED AT </p><p>DESTABILISATION, CREATES SUSPICION WHICH IN TURN </p><p>ADVERSELY AFFECTS BILATERAL RELATIONS.  I THEREFORE </p><p>WELCOME YOUR SCOPE AND BREADTH OF VISION.  THERE MAY AT </p><p>TIMES BE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS ON </p><p>CERTAIN MATTERS OF COMMON INTEREST, BUT WE SHOULD </p><p>HEARTILY AGREE TO DISAGREE WITHOUT BEING DISAGREEABLE. </p><p>OUR PERSPECTIVES AND SOCIAL ONTOLOGY MAY BE DIFFERENT, </p><p>BUT WE HAVE A COMMONALITY OF INTENT TO DO WHAT IS BEST </p><p>FOR OUR RESPECTIVE PEOPLES. </p><p> </p><p>AS TWO SOVEREIGN NATIONS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CATER </p><p>FOR EACH OTHER\'S NUANCES; EACH OTHER\'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT </p><p>AS A STATE MUST BE RESPECTED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE </p><p>PECULIARITIES OF OUR SOCIO-ECONOMIC HISTORY AND THE </p><p>PREVAILING CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE MUST HAVE MUTUAL RESPECT </p><p>FOR EACH OTHER\'S SOVEREIGNTY IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SIZE </p><p>AND ECONOMIC POWER OF THE COUNTRY CONCERNED.  WHAT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT IS THE PEOPLE OF CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY WHO </p><p>HAVE THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN SYSTEM OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITHOUT EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE.  THE GAMBIA IS </p><p>NO EXCEPTION. </p><p> </p><p>MR. AMBASSADOR, YOU ASSUME YOUR DUTIES AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>THE GAMBIA IS GOING THROUGH THE MOST CRUCIAL TURNING- </p><p>POINT IN ITS HISTORY SINCE INDEPENDENCE.  THOMAS </p><p>JEFFERSON, ONE OF THE PIONEERING SPIRITS WHO GAVE BIRTH </p><p>TO SOME OF THE GREATEST IDEALS OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, </p><p>WAS EMPHATIC THAT A GOVERNMENT THAT IS NOT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS PEOPLE DESERVES TO BE THROWN OUT. </p><p>WE DID JUST THAT. </p><p> </p><p>SINCE WE TOOK OVER THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT ON JULY 22ND </p><p>1994, THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL HAS </p><p>BEEN DILIGENTLY IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAMME OF </p><p>RECTIFICATION AND A TIMETABLE FOR A TRANSITION TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL RULE BY JULY 1996.  WE HAVE </p><p>NOT MET ALL THE SCHEDULED DEADLINES ON TIME BUT ALL THE </p><p>NECESSARY EFFORT IS BEING MADE WITH CONSIDERABLE </p><p>SUCCESS.  MOST OF OUR PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WILL </p><p>BE COMPLETED WELL BEFORE THE ELECTIONS; AND ON THE </p><p>GOVERNANCE TIMETABLE MOST OF THE MAJOR STEPS TOWARDS THE </p><p>ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDINGLY, ONCE AGAIN, WE URGE ALL FRIENDLY COUNTRIES </p><p>ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO CHERISH THE IDEALS OF TRUE </p><p>DEMOCRACY TO ASSIST THE GAMBIA IN WHICHEVER WAY THEY CAN </p><p>IN THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL RULE </p><p>BASED ON SOCIAL JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>IN CONCLUSION, LET ME AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR </p><p>ASSIGNMENT WELCOME YOU ONCE AGAIN TO THE GAMBIA AND </p><p>REASSURE YOU OF MY FULL SUPPORT AND THAT OF THE ENTIRE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF THE GAMBIA IN THE </p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENT OF YOUR IMPORTANT MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>I SINCERELY HOPE THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GAMBIA AND </p><p>THE UNITED STATES WILL BE IMPROVED UPON DURING YOUR TERM </p><p>OF OFFICE.  I THANK YOU.  UNQUOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCOTT </p><p></p></div>
