<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008558 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EPET, EMIN, KSAC, AMGT, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: WEEKLY ECONOMIC REPORT - WEEK OF DECEMBER 18 - </p><p>DECEMBER 24 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: Gasoline and diesel supplies were </p><p>adequate in Kinshasa, though reports that current </p><p>supplies are noxious persisted. The Congolese franc </p><p>weakened on the parallel market to about 142 Congolese </p><p>francs per US dollar.  The GDRC held a week-long </p><p>workshop on the conditions of state-owned companies. </p><p>The governments of the RDC and Congo-Brazzaville agreed </p><p>that debt payments from Congo-B for electricity would </p><p>go toward construction of a new high voltage line from </p><p>the Inga Dam.  The press continued to report that </p><p>diamond markets are depressed because the company with </p><p>an exclusive export license is not interested in buying </p><p>industrial diamonds and not capable of buying all gem- </p><p>quality stones.  The Honorary Consul of Cyprus was </p><p>caught with a packet of rough diamonds in her hand </p><p>luggage as she waited in the diplomatic lounge at </p><p>Kinshasa\'s airport for a flight to Brussels.  Inflation </p><p>slowed from last week\'s torrid pace, although merchants </p><p>raised clothing prices in advance of the holidays. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MOTOR FUEL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Fuel supplies were adequate and no long lines </p><p>formed at service stations.  Stations were once again </p><p>closed on Sunday to reduce fuel consumption, but </p><p>reopened on Monday, despite the Christmas holiday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Rumors that current fuel stocks are substandard </p><p>continued to circulate, and the press reported that </p><p>noxious fumes from fuel tanks sickened many people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MONETARY UPDATE/EXCHANGE RATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Congolese franc weakened on the parallel </p><p>market to about 142 Congolese francs per US dollar. </p><p>This surprised many observers who are accustomed to see </p><p>the franc strengthen at the end of the year because </p><p>employers need francs to pay the traditional bonus of </p><p>one month\'s salary.  The official exchange rate remains </p><p>50 francs per dollar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MINING NEWS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Diamond sector representatives continued to </p><p>complain about the exclusive export license granted to </p><p>Israeli firm IDI diamonds.  The press reported that </p><p>diamond markets are depressed because IDI is not </p><p>interested in buying industrial diamonds and not </p><p>capable of buying all gem-quality stones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The Honorary Consul of Cyprus was caught with a </p><p>packet of rough diamonds in her hand luggage as she </p><p>waited in the diplomatic lounge at Kinshasa\'s airport </p><p>for a flight to Brussels.  The incident recalled the </p><p>uproar when the Ambassador of Togo was caught smuggling </p><p>Congolese francs to Brazzaville. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LOCAL ECONOMIC NEWS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The GDRC held a week-long workshop on the </p><p>country\'s state-owned companies.  In his opening </p><p>remarks, the Minister for State Enterprise said the </p><p>goal of the exercise was threefold: to prepare a </p><p>diagnosis of the state of the parastatals; to identify </p><p>the current and more remote causes of the problems </p><p>identified; and to propose solutions that would permit </p><p>the state-owned sector to play the key role in </p><p>development that it played during the colonial era. </p><p>Officials from one of the companies represented at the </p><p>workshop, the Kisenge manganese mine, noted that their </p><p>mine had produced nothing since the railroad serving </p><p>the mine closed 25 years ago.  Individual state </p><p>enterprises estimated the investment that would be </p><p>required to rehabilitate their facilities.  The post </p><p>office/national phone company reported it needed a </p><p>relatively modest USD 38 million.  By contrast, </p><p>Kinshasa\'s International Fairgrounds claims it requires </p><p>a whopping USD 92 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The governments of the two Congos announced they </p><p>had reached an agreement on the repayment of USD 28 </p><p>million that Congo-Brazzaville owes the DRC for </p><p>electricity.  The funds will be set aside to construct </p><p>a second high voltage line from the Inga dam.  The head </p><p>of the DRC\'s electricity parastatal told the press </p><p>that, with funding for over half of the line\'s USD 50 </p><p>million cost already identified, the rest of the </p><p>necessary financing would be easy to obtain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.

(U) ADJUSTMENT TO INFLATION FIGURES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comparison of Embassy inflation statistics with </p><p>statistics from the Congolese Central Bank and the </p><p>Institute for Social and Economic Research show </p><p>discrepancies; the Embassy\'s estimate was significantly </p><p>lower for 1999 and has been consistently higher in </p><p>2000.  Examination of the methodology used in Embassy </p><p>estimates reveals that weightings in the market basket </p><p>have not been altered for almost ten years.  As a </p><p>result of changes in relative prices over the years, </p><p>the Embassy estimate has evolved to place an </p><p>increasingly heavy weight on some factors (notably </p><p>transportation) and an increasingly light weight on </p><p>other factors (notably food).  Starting in January, the </p><p>Embassy will adjust its weighting scheme to return to </p><p>the relative weights used in 1991. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.
