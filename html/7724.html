<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA, SA/INS,D </p><p>PASS TO USAID, AMBASSADOR WENDY CHAMBERLAIN, AA/ANE; </p><p>GORDON WEST, DAA/ANE; JAMES BEVER AND BERNADETTE BUNDY, </p><p>ANE/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  SIXTH TOKYO CORE AND EXPANDED GROUP MEETING OF </p><p>APRIL 28, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  GSL and multilaterals assess the Washington </p><p>Seminar a success.  Planning for the Tokyo Donor\'s </p><p>Conference continues as scheduled. The Colombo pre-Tokyo </p><p>Seminar has been postponed.  GSL, multilateral and </p><p>Bilateral donors have mixed views and strategies regarding </p><p>the LTTE suspension from the talks. GSL and multilaterals </p><p>ask for immediate pledges to the NERF to assuage the LTTE. </p><p>The Japanese have changed the agenda for Tokyo to </p><p>accommodate US concerns.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. Minister Moragoda chaired the meeting.  He indicated </p><p>that the GSL decided to go ahead with preparations for the </p><p>Tokyo Conference but would remain flexible in keeping the </p><p>door open for the LTTE.  Moragoda said that playing with </p><p>the schedules given the high-level representation </p><p>anticipated at the meeting was not an appropriate way to </p><p>proceed. The Colombo Seminar was put off and may be </p><p>rescheduled for later in May.  Moragoda said that the GSL </p><p>realized that there were high-risk elements to this </p><p>strategy and that the current situation was a test of </p><p>Government resolve.  The GSL was sincere in trying to </p><p>address the issues raised by the LTTE and hoped that the </p><p>LTTE suspension was not tactical or simply grandstanding. </p><p> </p><p>3. Minister Moragoda thanked donors for their governments\' </p><p>attendance at the Washington meeting, which he </p><p>characterized as successful in laying the foundation for </p><p>Tokyo.  Concerns were expressed that the press coverage </p><p>had given the impression that Washington was a pledging </p><p>conference, and this was misunderstood by the LTTE. </p><p>Moragoda reiterated that the GSL was resolute about the </p><p>Tokyo meeting and indicated that the current situation was </p><p>a test of the commitment to the process.  He hoped that </p><p>the LTTE\'s concerns were focused on substantive issues. </p><p> </p><p>4. The Japanese Ambassador said that although the GOJ </p><p>considered LTTE participation essential, Tokyo was </p><p>standing firm and resolute for the June conference date. </p><p>He was encouraged by the sincerity of the GSL\'s efforts to </p><p>bring the LTTE back to the table. He indicated that the </p><p>current and former Norwegian Ambassadors would be going to </p><p>see Thamilselvan in Kilinochchi on April 30 to ask the </p><p>LTTE to reconsider its suspension of the talks and its </p><p>participation in the Tokyo conference.  As previously </p><p>scheduled, Mr. Akashi is due in Sri Lanka from May 3 to </p><p>May 9.  Meetings for him are planned with the PM, </p><p>President, GL Peiris, international organizations and like- </p><p>minded Ambassadors. </p><p> </p><p>5. The time schedule for preparation of the Tokyo </p><p>documentation remains the same. The three documents to be </p><p>shared with donors include Regaining Sri Lanka, the needs </p><p>assessment document and a "bridging document" that has not </p><p>yet been drafted. The Japanese Ambassador said that the </p><p>draft Tokyo Conference agenda remains the same except for </p><p>the addition of a coffee break after the final plenary. </p><p>Since the final plenary included remarks by the LTTE, the </p><p>break would enable the USG to make final remarks along </p><p>with the other co-chairs without the LTTE at the head </p><p>table. </p><p> </p><p>6. On the topic of LTTE sensibilities, Minister Moragoda </p><p>indicated that the LTTE\'s perception right along has been </p><p>that the GSL is using the peace process to secure funding </p><p>for the South.  The GSL\'s intent has been neither to </p><p>humiliate nor corner the LTTE. The situation has now </p><p>reached a critical stage. The PM will be responding </p><p>directly to Balasingham\'s letter.  Bernard Gunathilake </p><p>will be explaining to Thamilselvan the immediate steps </p><p>that were being taken by the GSL to address the LTTE\'s </p><p>concerns.  Austin Fernando has developed a plan for the re- </p><p>relocation of division headquarters in Jaffna.  The GSL </p><p>and LTTE view the high security zones differently.  While </p><p>the GSL views them both as a security issue and a </p><p>humanitarian assistance issue, the LTTE thinks that this </p><p>is just an humanitarian issue (related to IDPs).  The GSL </p><p>suggested for discussion the issues beyond the high </p><p>security zones that were expected to be raised in the next </p><p>round of peace talks in Thailand.  Moragoda emphasized </p><p>that the GSL was making efforts to try to restart the </p><p>talks within a certain framework -- not just on the LTTE\'s </p><p>terms. The agenda must address issues of importance to </p><p>both sides, such as federalism. </p><p> </p><p>7. There was considerable discussion about the LTTE\'s </p><p>understanding of economic issues.  Ambassador Wills </p><p>queried the multilaterals as to the level of </p><p>sophistication of the LTTE on these issues.  Minister </p><p>Moragoda said that there needed to be an Economics 101 </p><p>discussion with the LTTE but he didn\'t know the venue for </p><p>such a talk.  The group was hopeful that Balasingham\'s </p><p>press response to Ambassador Wills\' newspaper interview </p><p>regarding open markets was a positive trend in the LTTE\'s </p><p>thinking. </p><p> </p><p>8. A number of Core Group members reported out on the NGO </p><p>workshop on the peace process that was convened by the </p><p>Center for Policy Alternatives last weekend. The </p><p>discussions workshop focused on such issues as the </p><p>perceived lack of consultation on Regaining Sri Lanka, </p><p>insufficient attention to human rights issues in the peace </p><p>talks, the need for benchmarks in the peace process, the </p><p>heavy emphasis of the role of the private sector in the </p><p>Needs Assessment and the feasibility of the NERF funding </p><p>mechanism. The World Bank representative said that finding </p><p>a representative group from civil society was a challenge </p><p>in Sri Lanka but a more systematic consultation process </p><p>was needed to address some of the ongoing concerns such as </p><p>those raised at the NGO workshop. </p><p> </p><p>9. The Wider Group meeting was held immediately following </p><p>the Core Group and was basically a summary of the prior </p><p>meeting. The major and heated topic of discussion was </p><p>pledging to the NERF since a number of donors in the Wider </p><p>Group had pledged to fund through this mechanism in Oslo. </p><p>Minister Moragoda and the multilaterals indicated that the </p><p>LTTE does not perceive that the WB\'s, ADB\'s or bilateral </p><p>funds going to the North and East as "its" and can not </p><p>claim them for political advantage.  It wants funds in the </p><p>NERF approved by SIRHN because the Tigers can claim that </p><p>they got these funds because of the struggle.  Moragoda </p><p>stated that the GSL was putting part of the debt relief </p><p>provided by the Netherlands into the NERF and part of it </p><p>into activities in the South. There were differing </p><p>opinions from donors about putting funds into the NERF </p><p>under the current situation. The GSL, World Bank, ADB and </p><p>UN were all encouraging donors to put funds in now as a </p><p>show of good faith.  The Italian Ambassador in his role as </p><p>EU political representative suggested that perhaps this </p><p>was a time not to follow the rules too closely.  The head </p><p>of UNHCR said that people needed to see more activity on </p><p>the ground regardless of how.  The LTTE had been empowered </p><p>to decide where and what type of projects would be </p><p>implemented in the North and East. The Netherlands, Swiss </p><p>and Sweden all expressed reservations about putting funds </p><p>in the NERF under these circumstances. (Note: the UK is </p><p>under the greatest pressure to commit to the NERF now </p><p>since had been ready to pledge $15 million prior to the </p><p>suspension of the peace talks but are reluctant to do so.) </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
