SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 30, </p><p>1989, WHEN ELEMENTS OF SUDAN\'S ARMORED AND AIRBORNE </p><p>FORCES SEIZED POWER FROM PRIME MINISTER SADIQ AL MAHDI, </p><p>IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT THE LONG-AWAITED TAKEOVER BY </p><p>THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT HAD FINALLY TAKEN PLACE. </p><p>HOWEVER, IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR THAT THE COUP HAD BEEN </p><p>ORGANIZED AND CARRIED OUT BY A SELECT FEW, PERHAPS EVEN </p><p>LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED OFFICERS AND MEN, NOT EVEN FULLY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TWO UNITS PRIMARILY INVOLVED.  THE </p><p>JUNTA QUICKLY ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>COMMAND COUNCIL (RCC) COMPOSED OF FIFTEEN MILITARY </p><p>OFFICERS RANGING IN RANK FROM BRIGADIER TO MAJOR.  SOME </p><p>OFFICERS SENIOR TO THE RCC MEMBERS WERE RETIRED.  DESPITE </p><p>THE RETIREMENTS AND TRANSFERS, IT APPEARED THAT SUDAN\'S </p><p>MILITARY WAS FIRMLY IN CHARGE OF THE GOVERNMENT.  MANY </p><p>RETIRED OFFICERS WERE CALLED BACK TO ACTIVE DUTY AND </p><p>ASSIGNED CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION POSTS SUCH AS REGIONAL </p><p>GOVERNOR.  OTHERS WHO HAD REMAINED ON ACTIVE DUTY WERE </p><p>PROMOTED.  MOST OF THE NEW "LEADERS" HAD SIGNIFICANT </p><p>COMBAT EXPERIENCE IN THE SOUTH AND ALL APPEARED TO </p><p>SUPPORT GENERAL OMAR AL BASHIR AND THE RCC. </p><p> </p><p>3.  TEN MONTHS AFTER THE COUP, THE MILITARY </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT, AS HAVE OTHERS, HAS BEEN FORCED TO </p><p>REEVALUATE ITS POSITION REGARDING THE GOS.  AS MANY AS </p><p>ONE THOUSAND OFFICERS (TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF </p><p>THE CORPS) HAVE BEEN SACKED AND THOSE REMAINING ARE </p><p>DISILLUSIONED BY THE DISTINCT ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST HUE </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE RECENT UNITY DECLARATION WITH </p><p>LIBYA.  THEY ARE ALSO UNHAPPY WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO MOVE DECISIVELY TO END THE WAR IN THE SOUTH. </p><p>NEARLY ONE HUNDRED ACTIVE AND RETIRED OFFICERS ARE IN </p><p>PRISON FOR TWO SEPARATE COUP PLOTS AND TWENTY EIGHT HAVE </p><p>ALREADY BEEN EXECUTED.  RUMORS OF CONTINUING PLOTTING </p><p>AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT ABOUND, BUT THE RCC AND ITS </p><p>SECURITY APPARATUS HAVE REPORTEDLY INFILTRATED UNITS FROM </p><p>THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST LEVELS, EFFECTIVELY PREEMPTING </p><p>ANY POTENTIALLY DECISIVE ACTION.  FROM APPARENT POWER TO </p><p>OBVIOUS EMASCULATION, SUDAN\'S MILITARY IS NOW MORE IN </p><p>CHECK THAN IN CHARGE AND FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A SMALL GROUP IN CHARGE </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN FEBRUARY 1989 WHEN SUDAN\'S MILITARY LEADERS GAVE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SADIQ AL MAHDI AN ULTIMATUM REGARDING THE </p><p>WAR IN THE SOUTH, IT WAS CLEAR TO MANY OBSERVERS THAT </p><p>SADIQ\'S DAYS WERE NUMBERED.  THE MILITARY HAD BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY UNHAPPY WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S LACK OF </p><p>DECISIVENESS AND PETTY PARTISAN BICKERING, THE CONTINUING </p><p>EROSION OF THE ECONOMY, AND THE GENERAL MALAISE AFFECTING </p><p>VIRTUALLY ALL SECTORS OF SUDANESE SOCIETY.  THUS, ON JUNE </p><p>30, 1989 WHEN RADIO OMDURMAN ANNOUNCED THAT THE MILITARY </p><p>HAD DEPOSED SADIQ, MOST SUDANESE WERE ACTUALLY RELIEVED. </p><p>WIDELY REGARDED AS THE MOST RATIONAL, MOST OBJECTIVE, AND </p><p>ONLY TRULY NATIONALIST GROUP IN SUDAN, THE MILITARY, IT </p><p>WAS BELIEVED, WOULD END THE WAR IN THE SOUTH AND GET THE </p><p>COUNTRY MOVING. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IT SOON BECAME CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT THE MILITARY HIGH </p><p>COMMAND HAD NO ROLE IN THE COUP.  THE COUP HAD BEEN </p><p>CARRIED OUT BY A FEW BRIGADIERS AND COLONELS WITH PERHAPS </p><p>LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED SOLDIERS.  A FORMER PARATROOP </p><p>COMMANDER, BRIG OMAR AL BASHIR EMERGED AS THE LEADER OF </p><p>THE REVOLUTION.  ALTHOUGH HE QUICKLY NAMED HIMSELF AND </p><p>FOURTEEN OTHER OFFICERS TO A REVOLUTION COMMAND COUNCIL </p><p>(RCC) TO RULE THE COUNTRY, CONFLICT WITH THE HIGH COMMAND </p><p>WAS IMMEDIATELY EVIDENT.  MOST OF THE RCC MEMBERS HAD </p><p>LITTLE COMMAND OR COMBAT EXPERIENCE.  THEY WERE PRIMARILY </p><p>STAFF AND SUPPORT OFFICERS AND NOT ONE, INCLUDING OMAR </p><p>HIMSELF, WAS WELL KNOWN WITHIN THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CONFLICT WITHIN THE MILITARY </p><p> </p><p>6.  RUMORS SPREAD QUICKLY OF A POSSIBLE COUNTERCOUP.  THE </p><p>FACT THAT OMAR AND HIS GROUP SUCCEEDED BY DECEIVING UNIT </p><p>COMMANDERS, PLAYING THEM OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER AND </p><p>LEADING THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE ACTING WITH THE </p><p>APPROVAL AND SUPPORT OF THE HIGH COMMAND, UNDERMINED THE </p><p>REVOLUTION\'S LEGITIMACY.  MANY BELIEVED THEN, AS THEY DO </p><p>NOW, THAT OMAR, AIDED AND ABETTED BY THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC </p><p>FRONT (NIF), MADE HIS MOVE WHEN AND HOW HE DID TO THWART </p><p>OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS FROM CARRYING OUT THEIR OWN COUP. </p><p>THEY ALSO ALLEGE THAT THE COUP WAS DESIGNED TO THWART THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS WHICH LOOKED PROMISING AND WHICH THE NIF </p><p>OPPOSED.  WHETHER THE NIF WAS INVOLVED OR NOT IS STILL </p><p>QUESTIONABLE, BUT THE PREEMPTION SCENARIO HELPS EXPLAIN </p><p>WHY THERE WAS NO OPPOSITION TO THE COUP--NO ONE REALLY </p><p>KNEW WHO WAS IN CHARGE AND VIRTUALLY EVERYONE SUPPORTED </p><p>ONE COUP PLOTTER OR ANOTHER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT WITHIN THE </p><p>MILITARY REPORTEDLY WAS THE 7TH ARMORED DIVISION </p><p>COMMANDER, MAJOR GENERAL MIRGHANI YASIN BABIKIR, A WELL </p><p>RESPECTED OFFICER WHO MANY BELIEVED HAD HIS OWN PLANS. </p><p>HE TOO HAD BEEN DUPED BY OMAR AND HAD IN FACT MADE OMAR\'S </p><p>SUCCESS POSSIBLE BY COMMITTING HIS DUTY OFFICER, MAJOR </p><p>IBRAHIM SHAMS EL DIN, TO BRING FIFTEEN TANKS INTO THE </p><p>CITY FROM THEIR BASE AT AL SHAGARA.  LITTLE DID GENERAL </p><p>BABIKIR KNOW THAT SHAMS EL DIN WAS IN LEAGUE WITH OMAR. </p><p>WITHOUT THE TANKS TO COMMAND KEY POINTS IN AND AROUND THE </p><p>CITY, THE COUP PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FAILED.  THE ISOLATION </p><p>AND SUBSEQUENT SWIFT ARREST OF THE SPAF HIGH COMMAND ALSO </p><p>PREVENTED THE ISSUANCE OF ORDERS TO SUPPRESS BASHIR\'S </p><p>COHORTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  OMAR REASSURED GENERAL BABIKIR AND OTHER SENIOR </p><p>OFFICERS OF HIS NATIONALISM AND UNSELFISH COMMITMENT TO </p><p>SUDAN.  HE ALSO ASSURED THEM HE WOULD NOT POLITICIZE THE </p><p>MILITARY AND THAT HE WOULD KEEP IT ABOVE THE SECTARIAN </p><p>SQUABBLES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTIES.  PROFESSIONAL </p><p>OFFICERS ADOPTED A "WAIT AND SEE" ATTITUDE. </p><p> </p><p>SENIOR OFFICERS OUT </p><p> </p><p>9.  WHILE REASSURING THE MILITARY ON ONE HAND, THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO DISCHARGE OFFICERS SENIOR </p><p>TO THE RCC MEMBERS.  VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE COMMAND </p><p>STRUCTURE WAS PENSIONED OFF ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY </p><p>THREE HUNDRED OTHER OFFICERS TO INCLUDE MAJOR GENERALS, </p><p>BRIGADIERS, AND A FEW COLONELS.  SEVERAL OFFICERS </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO THE REVOLUTION WERE PROMOTED AND A FEW WHO </p><p>HAD BEEN RETIRED WERE RECALLED TO SERVE AS REGIONAL </p><p>GOVERNORS AND IN OTHER ROLES IN THE GOVERNMENT.  THE NEW </p><p>COMMAND STRUCTURE JUSTIFIED THE RCC\'S ACTIONS IN MILITARY </p><p>TERMS, INDICATING THAT OFFICERS SENIOR TO THE MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE RCC COULD NOT TAKE ORDERS FROM THEM.  RETIRED </p><p>OFFICERS IN SUDAN RECEIVE NINETY PERCENT PAY SO THERE WAS </p><p>LITTLE IMPACT ON THEIR FINANCIAL WELL-BEING.  IN MAY </p><p>1990, HOWEVER, RETIRED OFFICERS LOST SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS </p><p>INCLUDING ACCESS TO MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND FUEL </p><p>SUPPLIES FOR PERSONAL VEHICLES. </p><p> </p><p>CONFLICT BETWEEN THE RCC AND THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT </p><p> </p><p>10.  PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, AROSE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BETWEEN </p><p>THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT AND THE RCC.  THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT, IN ATTEMPTING TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY AND DEAL </p><p>WITH THE MANY NON-MILITARY PROBLEMS FACING IT, PAID LESS </p><p>AND LESS ATTENTION TO THE CONCERNS OF THE MILITARY </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT.  RUMORS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS CONTROLLED </p><p>OR HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) </p><p>FURTHER UNDERMINED THE RCC.  THE MILITARY, FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME, BEGAN TO FEEL THE THREAT OF POLITICIZATION. </p><p>HOWEVER, THEY CONTINUED TO "WAIT AND SEE," THOUGH SEVERAL </p><p>OFFICERS CLAIM THEY URGED GENERAL OMAR TO PURGE OR </p><p>OTHERWISE CONTROL THE NIF INFLUENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  DUE TO A GENUINE DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND PARTLY IN AN </p><p>EFFORT TO APPEASE THE MILITARY, THE RCC ANNOUNCED A </p><p>CONTINUATION OF THE CEASE-FIRE WITH THE SPLA/M AND </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE CIVIL WAR IN THE </p><p>SOUTH.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE NEW GOVERNMENT BEGAN </p><p>REINFORCING GARRISONS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH WITH ARMS </p><p>PURCHASED FROM CHINA BY THE SADIQ GOVERNMENT.  ADDITIONAL </p><p>SHIPMENTS OF SMALL ARMS AND AMMUNITION WERE ARRANGED WITH </p><p>LIBYA AND IRAQ WHICH BEGAN TO MAKE DELIVERIES DIRECTLY </p><p>INTO JUBA AS WELL AS KHARTOUM.  NEGOTIATING FROM A </p><p>POSITION OF STRENGTH WAS THE WATCHWORD AND THE MILITARY </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT APPEARED SATISFIED, CONVINCED OF THE RCC\'S </p><p>SINCERITY. </p><p> </p><p>THE WAR IN THE SOUTH </p><p> </p><p>12.  NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SPLA/M DID NOT GO WELL AND IN </p><p>LATE OCTOBER GARANG\'S FORCES ATTACKED AND TOOK THE BORDER </p><p>TOWN OF KURMUK.  THE GOS RESPONDED BY BOMBING SEVERAL </p><p>SOUTHERN TOWNS AND THE CEASE-FIRE EFFECTIVELY ENDED.  GOS </p><p>FORCES RETOOK KURMUK IN LATE NOVEMBER, AFTER THE SPLA </p><p>WITHDREW, BUT REBEL FORCES LAUNCHED SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS ON </p><p>GOVERNMENT GARRISONS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH.  ADDITIONAL </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS FAILED TO ACHIEVE A CEASE-FIRE AND THE SPLA </p><p>BESIEGED YEI IN AN EFFORT TO TAKE ALL OF EASTERN </p><p>EQUATORIA AND ISOLATE JUBA.  THEY ALSO BEGAN </p><p>INDISCRIMINATE SHELLING OF JUBA.  REINFORCED BY TROOPS </p><p>FROM JUBA, YEI HELD AND THE SPLA CAMPAIGN CAME TO A </p><p>HALT.  ALTHOUGH FIGHTING CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, </p><p>AND BOTH THE SPAF AND THE SPLA APPEAR TO BE MASSING </p><p>TROOPS FOR A MAJOR CONFRONTATION IN UPPER NILE REGION, </p><p>BOTH SIDES ARE AGAIN STALEMATED, ALTHOUGH SOME MIGHT </p><p>ARGUE THAT THE SPLA NOW HAS THE UPPER HAND. </p><p> </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ARMY OR BUDDING ISLAMIC LEGION? </p><p> </p><p>13.  AS NIF INFLUENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT INCREASED, SO DID </p><p>DISSATISFACTION WITHIN THE MILITARY.  TO PROTECT ITSELF </p><p>FROM DISAFFECTED OFFICERS THE RCC INFILTRATED VIRTUALLY </p><p>EVERY MILITARY UNIT WITH LOYALISTS, MANY WITH STRONG NIF </p><p>SYMPATHIES.  AT THE SAME TIME, NIF SYMPATHIZERS WERE </p><p>ADMITTED IN INCREASING NUMBERS TO OFFICER TRAINING </p><p>SCHOOL.  BY EARLY APRIL 1990 SENIOR NIF MEMBERS TOLD </p><p>EMBOFFS THAT AS MANY AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE OFFICER </p><p>CORPS WERE NIF, UP FROM AN ESTIMATED LESS THAN FIVE </p><p>PERCENT DURING THE SADIQ ERA.  FOLLOWING THE MARCH AND </p><p>APRIL COUP ATTEMPTS, ANOTHER THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED </p><p>OFFICERS WERE PURGED FROM THE MILITARY, INCREASING NIF </p><p>AND OTHER LOYALIST CONTROL OF UNITS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF MOST ARMY UNITS ARE STAFFED BY </p><p>SOLDIERS AND NCOS FROM THE SOUTH.  MOST HAVE LITTLE </p><p>COMMITMENT OR DEDICATION TO THE GOVERNMENT--THEY JOINED </p><p>FOR THE SUGAR AND OTHER RATIONS GIVEN TO SOLDIERS, AS </p><p>WELL AS THE SALARY.  ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE OFTEN ACQUITTED </p><p>THEMSELVES WELL IN BATTLE, GENERALLY SURRENDERING ONLY </p><p>WHEN THEIR FOOD AND AMMUNITION WERE DEPLETED, THEY HAVE </p><p>LITTLE STOMACH FOR OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS.  AS WITH MORE </p><p>OBVIOUS MERCENARIES, THEIR LOYALTY IS A FUNCTION OF THEIR </p><p>PAY AND ALLOWANCES.  OFFICERS IN THE SOUTH ARE ALSO KNOWN </p><p>FOR THEIR CORRUPTION WHICH NOT ONLY EARNS THEM THE ENMITY </p><p>OF THE LOCAL POPULATION BUT ALSO FURTHER DIVIDES THEM </p><p>FROM THEIR TROOPS.  NORTHERN, ARAB OFFICERS ARE </p><p>REPORTEDLY LESS THAN COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR SUBORDINATES </p><p>AND THIS FEELING OF UNEASE IS INCREASING AS THE OFFICER </p><p>CORPS BECOME MORE AND MORE POLITICIZED. </p><p> </p><p>15.  OFFICERS ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE CURRENT HIGH </p><p>COMMAND LACKS THE PERSONALITIES AND CLOUT TO TAKE ON THE </p><p>RCC OVER ISSUES CONCERNING THE WELFARE OF THE OFFICER </p><p>CORPS.  THIS IS A MARKED DEPARTURE FROM THE TRADITIONAL </p><p>POLITICO-MILITARY EQUATION IN SUDAN.  THE MILITARY HAS </p><p>ALSO NOT BEEN IMMUNE TO RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER LAWS AND </p><p>REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE NEW GOVERNMENT.  MILITARY </p><p>OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO OBSERVE CURFEW HOURS AND </p><p>CURRENCY AND TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS.  ALTHOUGH FEW OFFICERS </p><p>HAVE BEEN DISCIPLINED BY THE REGIME, (EXCEPT THOSE </p><p>IMPLICATED IN COUP PLOTS OR ATTEMPTS), SEVERAL, INCLUDING </p><p>THE CHIEF OF STAFF, HAVE RELATIVES WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED </p><p>OR ROUGHED UP BY SECURITY OFFICIALS.  IN ALMOST ALL </p><p>CASES, THE OFFICER\'S STATUS HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENT TO </p><p>PROTECT THE RELATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  TO AUGMENT THE ARMY, THE GOS IN LATE 1989 PASSED THE </p><p>POPULAR DEFENSE ACT PROVIDING FOR THE LOCAL ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES (PDF) AND THE ARMING OF TRIBAL </p><p>MILITIAS.  ALTHOUGH MILITIAS ARE NOW BETTER ARMED THAN </p><p>EVER BEFORE, THE GOS EXERTS LITTLE CONTROL OVER THEM. </p><p>POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES HAVE BEEN ALMOST COMPLETELY TAKEN </p><p>OVER BY NIF ELEMENTS.  AS SUCH, ALTHOUGH NOMINALLY UNDER </p><p>A MILITARY COMMANDER, THEY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>COUNTERFORCE TO THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT.  AS MANY AS </p><p>TWO THOUSAND KHARTOUM RESIDENTS, MOSTLY NIF SYMPATHIZERS </p><p>AND INCLUDING MANY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, WERE RECRUITED </p><p>AND TRAINED IN THE PDF.  SEVERAL OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT </p><p>MILITARY UNITS MAY EVENTUALLY BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE </p><p>KHARTOUM AREA WHOSE SECURITY WILL BE PROVIDED FOR BY PDF </p><p>FORCES ACTING AS A PALACE GUARD.  SUCH A CHANGE WOULD </p><p>FURTHER REDUCE TRADITIONAL MILITARY INFLUENCE IN SUDAN. </p><p>SO FAR, HOWEVER, THE NIF HAS ONLY BEEN MARGINALLY </p><p>SUCCESSFUL IN THE PDF.  THERE IS LITTLE EMPATHY BETWEEN </p><p>THEM AND THEIR TRAINERS AND MANY NIF RECRUITS HAVE </p><p>ALREADY DESERTED DUE TO THE SPARTAN AND DISCIPLINED </p><p>CONDITIONS IN PDF CAMPS. </p><p> </p><p>BUDGET/CAPABILITIES </p><p> </p><p>17.  ACTUAL MINISTRY OF DEFENSE EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL </p><p>YEAR 1988-1989 UNDER THE SADIQ GOVERNMENT TOTALLED 1.5 </p><p>BILLION SUDANESE POUNDS (333 MILLION USDOLS AT THE LEGAL </p><p>RATE OF EXCHANGE).  THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1989-1990 </p><p>UNDER GENERAL OMAR ALLOCATES 3.6 BILLION SUDANESE POUNDS </p><p>(800 MILLION USDOLS) FOR DEFENSE.  NEITHER OF THESE </p><p>FIGURES INCLUDES THE APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION USDOLS WHICH </p><p>THE GOS SAYS THAT IT SPENDS PER DAY IN WAGING THE WAR IN </p><p>THE SOUTH.  ALTHOUGH THE INCREASE OF OVER 100 PERCENT IN </p><p>DEFENSE SPENDING IS IMPRESSIVE, PLANNED EXPENDITURES IN </p><p>THE MINISTRIES OF AGRICULTURE AND ENERGY ALSO DOUBLED, </p><p>AND THE IRRIGATION MINISTRY SHOWS A 300 PERCENT </p><p>INCREASE.  DESPITE THEIR BACKGROUNDS, THE RCC HAS NOT </p><p>FAVORED THE MILITARY OVER OTHER MINISTRIES.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO RCC ECONOMIC COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, COL. SALAH </p><p>EL DIN KARRAR, THERE WILL BE NO PROMOTIONS OR PAY RAISES </p><p>IN THE MILITARY FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>18.  SHORTLY AFTER ASSUMING POWER, GENERAL OMAR\'S </p><p>GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO RECEIVE TANKS, ARMORED CARS, AND AIR </p><p>DEFENSE AND FIELD ARTILLERY FROM THE PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC OF </p><p>CHINA.  ALTHOUGH CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE </p><p>CAPABILITIES OF THE SPAF, THIS EQUIPMENT HAD BEEN ORDERED </p><p>BY SADIQ AND FINANCED BY SAUDI ARABIA (THROUGH A THIRD </p><p>COUNTRY) PRIOR TO JUNE 30.  SMALL ARMS AND AMMUNITION AND </p><p>AIR TRANSPORTS WERE PROVIDED BY BOTH LIBYA AND IRAQ AT </p><p>OMAR\'S REQUEST.  OTHERWISE, THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS DONE </p><p>LITTLE TO ENHANCE OR STRENGTHEN THE MILITARY. </p><p>RECRUITMENT INTO MILITARY UNITS, AFTER AN INITIAL SURGE, </p><p>HAS NOW TAPERED OFF IN FAVOR OF THE PDF. </p><p> </p><p>19.  SPAF STRENGTH HAS REMAINED CONSTANT WITH AN ESTIMATE </p><p>OF APPROXIMATELY 4,000-6,000 OFFICERS AND 65,000-70,000 </p><p>ENLISTED MEN AND WOMEN.  THERE ARE 55,000-60,000 IN THE </p><p>ARMY; 3,000 IN THE AIR FORCE; 3,000 IN THE AIR DEFENSE </p><p>FORCE; AND 1,500 IN THE NAVY.  ORDER OF BATTLE INCLUDES </p><p>FOUR INFANTRY DIVISIONS; ONE ARMORED DIVISION; ONE </p><p>ENGINEER DIVISION; ONE AIRBORNE DIVISION CONSISTING OF </p><p>ONE BRIGADE, SPECIAL FORCES AND RECONNAISANCE UNITS; </p><p>FIELD AND AIR DEFENSE ARTILLERY UNITS; AND A </p><p>TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLY CORPS.  THE AIR FORCE HAS </p><p>THIRTY-THREE OPERATIONAL SOVIET AND CHINESE MIG-21, </p><p>MIG-23, F-5, AND  F-6 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT; SIX C-130 </p><p>TRANSPORTS (FIVE OPERATIONAL); THIRTY-FOUR U.S., FRENCH, </p><p>AND SOVIET HELICOPTERS; AND FIVE OPERATIONAL SOVIET </p><p>TRANSPORTS.  NAVAL EQUIPMENT INCLUDES EIGHTEEN COASTAL </p><p>PATROL CRAFT, MOSTLY PROVIDED BY YUGOSLAVIA.  ALL SENIOR </p><p>SUDANESE NAVAL OFFICERS WERE TRAINED IN YUGOSLAVIA, BUT </p><p>NAVAL OPERATIONAL READINESS REMAINS VERY LOW. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>20.  WHILE SUDAN\'S MILITARY APPEARS LITTLE CHANGED AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE JUNE 30, 1989 COUP, THE MILITARY </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT IS RADICALLY DIFFERENT.  PREMATURE </p><p>RETIREMENTS, PROMOTIONS WITHOUT REGARD TO SENIORITY, AND </p><p>ASSIGNMENTS WITHOUT REGARD TO ABILITY HAVE SERIOUSLY </p><p>UNDERMINED TRADITIONAL MILITARY VALUES.  TOGETHER WITH </p><p>OBVIOUS POLITICIZATION OF THE OFFICER CORPS, THEY HAVE </p><p>ERODED PROFESSIONALISM PERHAPS BEYOND REPAIR. </p><p> </p><p>21.  EXECUTIONS FOR THE APRIL 1990 COUP ATTEMPT FOLLOWING </p><p>HASTILY ORGANIZED CLOSED TRIALS WITH NO REGARD TO DUE </p><p>PROCESS HAVE FURTHER ISOLATED THE GOS FROM THE MILITARY. </p><p>DISAFFECTION IN THE ARMED FORCES REMAINS HIGH AND IS </p><p>LIKELY TO INCREASE.  COUP PLOTTING CONTINUES AND FUTURE </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO DEPOSE GENERAL OMAR AND THE RCC ARE ALMOST </p><p>CERTAIN. </p><p> </p><p>22.  WHILE THE CURRENT GOS IS CONTROLLED BY CAREER </p><p>MILITARY OFFICERS AND NO EFFORT HAS BEEN SPARED TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE SPAF WITH THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO </p><p>PROSECUTE THE WAR IN THE SOUTH, SUDAN\'S MILITARY IS FAR </p><p>FROM IN CHARGE OF THE COUNTRY.  THE SPLA STILL CONTROLS </p><p>THE MAJORITY OF THE SOUTH AND NIF INFLUENCE IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS DRIVEN A WEDGE BETWEEN THE RCC AND THEIR </p><p>FORMER COMRADES IN ARMS.  SUDAN MAY HAVE A MILITARY </p><p>GOVERNMENT, BUT FOR THE TIME BEING THE MILITARY ITSELF </p><p>HAS BEEN CHECKED AND GENERAL OMAR APPEARS TO BE SETTING </p><p>UP THE MATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
