(C) AT A CLOSED SESSION ON MAY 8, THE CROATIAN </p><p>CABINET FORMALLY DECIDED TO ACCEPT FUNDS FROZEN IN THE </p><p>U.S. UNDER MILOSEVIC-ERA SANCTIONS.  ON MAY 7 </p><p>WE MET WITH MFA SENIOR LEGAL ADVISOR ANDREJA METELKO- </p><p>ZGOMBIC AND AMERICA\'S DESK DIRECTOR MIROSLAV KOVACIC TO </p><p>PRESS FOR CROATIAN ACCEPTANCE.  THIS ISSUE WAS ALSO </p><p>RAISED DURING THE SECRETARY\'S MEETING WITH FM PICULA ON </p><p>THE MARGINS OF THE SIGNING OF THE ADRIATIC CHARTER ON MAY </p><p>2. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ON MAY 9 WE CONFIRMED WITH METELKO-ZGOMBIC THAT </p><p>THE CABINET HAD DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE FUNDS, WHILE NOT </p><p>PREJUDICING THE PARLIAMENT\'S DECISION ON WHETHER TO </p><p>RATIFY THE AGREEMENT ON SUCCESSION ISSUES (ASI).  IN </p><p>COMMENTS TO THE PRESS AFTER THE CABINET SESSION, </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ALSO ANNOUNCED IT WOULD SEEK LEGAL </p><p>ACTION AGAINST ONE OF THE JOINT VENTURE BANKS IN GERMANY, </p><p>WHERE DEPOSITS MYSTERIOUSLY ERODED.  METELKO-ZGOMBIC </p><p>STATED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE LEGAL ACTION WOULD BE TO </p><p>TRY TO FORCE DISCLOSURE OF THE HISTORY OF THE ACCOUNTS, </p><p>THOUGH IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOME SORT OF RESTITUTION </p><p>MIGHT BE SOUGHT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) ON MAY 8, IN A CLOSED CABINET SESSION, THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01031  01 OF 02  091345Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE APPROXIMATELY $56 </p><p>MILLION TRANSFER FROM THE USG.  DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>IVAN SIMONOVIC WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WAS MIXING "PRINCIPLES WITH PRAGMATISM," STRESSING THAT </p><p>ACCEPTING THE MONEY DID NOT MEAN THAT CROATIA WOULD </p><p>RATIFY THE ASI.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE </p><p>DECISION TO FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE LHB BANK IN </p><p>GERMANY, APPARENTLY PARTIALLY OWNED BY SLOVENIA\'S </p><p>LJUBLJANSKA BANKA.  IN RESPONSE TO OUR QUERY, METELKO- </p><p>ZGOMBIC CLARIFIED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE LAWSUIT WOULD </p><p>BE TO EXTRACT INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISAPPEARING </p><p>DEPOSITS, THOUGH SHE DID NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>SEEKING SOME SORT OF COMPENSATION FROM THE BANK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE DAY BEFORE THE DECISION, WE MET WITH MFA </p><p>SENIOR LEGAL ADVISOR ANDREJA METELKO-ZGOMBIC AND </p><p>AMERICA\'S DESK DIRECTOR MIROSLAV KOVACIC TO PRESS FOR </p><p>CROATIAN ACCEPTANCE OF THE FUNDS FROZEN IN THE U.S. UNDER </p><p>MILOSEVIC-ERA SANCTIONS.  WE STRESSED THAT WE SAW THE </p><p>DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUNDS IN THE U.S. AS SEPARATE FROM </p><p>THE ISSUE OF THE ASI, ALTHOUGH RESOLUTION OF THE LATTER </p><p>WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN CROATIA\'S INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) METELKO-ZGOMBIC ACKNOWLEDGED THE RESOLUTION OF </p><p>SUCCESSION ISSUES WAS IN CROATIA\'S INTERESTS, BUT THE </p><p>PUBLIC AND THE PARLIAMENT WERE DEMANDING ANSWERS.  SHE </p><p>REJECTED THE ARGUMENT THAT "EVERYONE IN VIENNA KNEW" THAT </p><p>THE NUMBERS IN THE ASI WERE NOTIONAL; WHILE ADMITTING THE </p><p>LIMITS OF HER KNOWLEDGE OF BANKING, SHE INSISTED THAT </p><p>"ANY VILLAGE BANK" COULD COME UP WITH A FIGURE FOR ITS </p><p>DEPOSITS.  WHEN CROATIA WENT TO THE OVERSEAS JOINT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01031  01 OF 02  091345Z </p><p>VENTURE BANKS TO ASK FOR AN ACCOUNTING, IT WAS REBUFFED </p><p>AND SENT TO THE NATIONAL BANK OF YUGOSLAVIA.  METELKO- </p><p>ZGOMBIC INSISTED THAT THE NBY WAS EVADING ITS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY, AS LAID OUT IN APPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX C OF </p><p>THE ASI, TO FACILITATE THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION FROM </p><p>THE JOINT VENTURE BANKS TO THE SUCCESSOR STATES.  WE </p><p>WONDERED ALOUD WHETHER A FULL ACCOUNTING WOULD REALLY BE </p><p>ENOUGH TO CONVINCE THE PARLIAMENT TO SWALLOW AND RATIFY; </p><p>METELKO-ZGOMBIC RETORTED IT WAS THE LEAST THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>COULD DO. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) TURNING TO THE DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS FROM THE </p><p>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK, METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID </p><p>SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE </p><p>UNFREEZING OF THE FUNDS, AS WE HAD PROMISED TO DO, AND </p><p>THE DECISION TO DIVIDE AND DISBURSE THE FUNDS, WHICH HAD </p><p>COME AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE, AND THROUGH A RATHER UNUSUAL </p><p>CHANNEL -- THE U.S. BANK COMMUNICATION TO THE CROATIAN </p><p>NATIONAL BANK.  WE EMPHASIZED THAT THE USG HAD DECIDED </p><p>THE QUICKEST AND MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO GET THE SUCCESSOR </p><p>STATES BACK THEIR OWN MONEY, UN-ERODED BY LAWSUITS, WAS </p><p>THROUGH THIS MECHANISM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WHILE REFUSING TO PREJUDGE THE FINAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>DECISION, METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID THE GOVERNMENT WOULD TRY </p><p>TO FIND A WAY TO ACCEPT THE FUNDS WITHOUT PREJUDICING THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3465 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01031  02 OF 02  091345Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   C-00     DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------628C22  091347Z /38 </p><p>R 091332Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0150 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 001031 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC </p><p>EUR/SCE FOR DNYSTROM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EFIN, ECON, MK, SR, BK, SI, MW, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA DECIDES TO ACCEPT UNFROZEN FUNDS "WITHOUT </p><p>PREJUDICE" TO RATIFICATION OF ASI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01031  02 OF 02  091345Z </p><p> </p><p>LEGISLATURE\'S DECISION ON RATIFICATION OF THE ASI. </p><p>PERSONALLY, SHE FEARED THAT ONCE AN AGREEMENT BEGINS TO </p><p>BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT RATIFICATION, THE RATIFICATION </p><p>LOSES SIGNIFICANCE.
