<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 001638 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EUR FOR PASCOE; NEA FOR CROCKER; ALSO FOR EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: CENTCOM PROPOSAL FOR US-TURKEY-IRAQI KURD </p><p>POLICY CELL TO DECONFLICT FORCES AND AVOID CONFRONTATIONS </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>B and D. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) DCM was contacted March 14 by CENTCOM POLAD, who said </p><p>that CDR CENTCOM wanted, as the minimum acceptable </p><p>deliverable for upcoming talks with Turks and Iraqi Kurds, </p><p>the establishment of a 24-hour/day policy-level cell staffed </p><p>by US, Turkish and Iraqi Kurdish reps.  The cell would </p><p>deconflict forces, clarify rumors, and ensure that no </p><p>unintended confrontations took place. CENTCOM said the cell </p><p>could be based wherever it would be most effective, so long </p><p>as it had access to information on a real-time basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Comment:  While we believe there is significant merit </p><p>to a process to try to prevent misunderstanding spinning out </p><p>of control in northern Iraq, we are concerned the Turks will </p><p>not react positively, and we lack any details.  The Turks </p><p>have told us in the past that they will not share their </p><p>military planning with the Iraqi Kurds.  They will react </p><p>badly to any arrangement that implies equality between the </p><p>Turkish reps and reps of the Iraqi Kurdish parties.  In </p><p>addition, the Turks are likely to insist on the participation </p><p>of an ITF rep, which could complicate matters in terms of </p><p>sharing sensitive information.  We also do not know whether </p><p>this arrangement has been discussed with the Kurds or any </p><p>other parties in advance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Post urgently seeks Washington guidance on the CENTCOM </p><p>proposal in time to </p><p>deploy during Amb. Khalilzad\'s March 14-15 bilaterals with </p><p>the Turks. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
