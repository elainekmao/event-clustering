<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 002492 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, CASC, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: KATHMANDU VALLEY STRIKE SHUTS DOWN BUSINESS, HALTS </p><p>TRANSPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 2484 </p><p> </p><p>1.  The December 29-30 general strike ("bandh") called by the </p><p>Maoists in the Narayani and Bagmati zones, the latter of </p><p>which includes the Kathmandu Valley (Reftel), was generally </p><p>well observed throughout the city.  The roads were empty of </p><p>most public and private transportation both days, with the </p><p>exception of diplomatic vehicles, army trucks, and a few </p><p>intrepid motorcycles (with license plate numbers blocked </p><p>out).  Approximately 80 percent of shops and stores remained </p><p>shuttered along the main roads, although slightly more </p><p>businesses ventured to open the second day. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Valley was generally quiet for the duration of the </p><p>two-day strike.  On December 27 four armed Maoists bombed the </p><p>Village Development Committee (VDC) building in Gongabu, 3 km </p><p>north of the Embassy, after forcing the employees out at </p><p>mid-day.  No one was injured in the incident.  The same day </p><p>in Nuwakot District, approximately 35 km north of the </p><p>capital, armed Maoists burnt down a residence previously </p><p>owned by Princess Helen Shah, aunt of King Gyanendra.  No one </p><p>was hurt in the incident, although the property suffered </p><p>extensive damage. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Comment:  The strike may have been timed to disrupt </p><p>festivities planned to celebrate the December 30 birthday of </p><p>Crown Prince Paras.  As in previous Maoist strikes, the high </p><p>degree of observance is more attributable to popular fear of </p><p>the insurgents and their terrorist tactics, than to support </p><p>for their ideology.  In any case, adherence to periodic </p><p>Maoist bandhs can be expected as long as local residents feel </p><p>unable to rely on the Government to protect them should they </p><p>defy Maoist diktats. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
