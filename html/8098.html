<p>CONFIDENTIAL  ROME 02150 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR AMB. ZOELLICK, AMB. JOHNSON, NOVELLI </p><p>STATE PASS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FOR SECY. VENEMAN, </p><p>PENN, HEGWOOD </p><p>STATE FOR E - U/S LARSON, EB - A/S WAYNE, EUR - PDAS RIES, </p><p>MORFORD, HENNESSEY-NILAND </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR NSC/NEC </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EAGR, TBIO, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: EU BIOTECH: ITALIAN REACTION TO U.S. ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>OF WTO BIOTECH CASE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 124277 </p><p> </p><p>B. STATE 125512 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ITALIAN GOVERNMENT REACTION TO THE MAY 13 USG </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT REQUESTING WTO CONSULTATIONS ON THE EU,S </p><p>MORATORIUM ON BIOTECH APPROVALS HAS BEEN RESTRAINED. FOREIGN </p><p>TRADE VICE MINISTER URSO SUGGESTED THAT RESOLUTION OF THE </p><p>BIOTECH CASE MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THROUGH LINKAGE WITH OTHER </p><p>DISPUTES, ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT FORESEE PROGRESS DURING THE </p><p>SIXTY DAY CONSULTATIONS PERIOD.  AGRICULTURAL MINISTER </p><p>ALEMANNO, THE MOST OUTSPOKEN GOI OPPONENT TO BIOTECH, SO FAR </p><p>HAS DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE U.S. ACTION.  THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>ENVIRONMENT IS LIKELY TO DISENGAGE FROM EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>EU DIRECTIVE 01/018 WHILE THE WTO CASE IS PENDING, AND THE </p><p>MINISTER OF HEALTH, THOUGH PERSONALLY PRO-BIOTECH, WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO DEFER TO ALEMANNO ON THE ISSUE.  ITALIAN PRESS </p><p>REACTION HAS ALSO BEEN RATHER RESERVED. EMBASSY ROME AND </p><p>CONSULATES FLORENCE, MILAN AND NAPLES ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT A ROBUST PUBLIC DIPLOMACY PROGRAM TO SUPPORT USG </p><p>BIOTECH POLICY IN LIGHT OF THE WTO CASE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN TRADE MINISTRY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ECMIN INITIATED A MAY 14 MEETING WITH FOREIGN TRADE </p><p>VICE MINISTER ADOLFO URSO BY NOTING THAT, AFTER FIVE YEARS, </p><p>U.S. PATIENCE WITH THE CONTINUED EU MORATORIUM ON BIOTECH </p><p>APPROVALS HAD FINALLY RUN OUT. DESPITE REPEATED EU ASSURANCES </p><p>OVER THE YEARS, A SOLUTION STILL DOES NOT APPEAR IMMINENT. </p><p>IN ADDITION TO OUR CONCERNS THAT U.S. EXPORTS ARE BEING </p><p>EXCLUDED ILLEGALLY FROM THE EU MARKET, THE U.S. WORRIES </p><p>INCREASINGLY THAT THE EU MORATORIUM IS STIGMATIZING BIOTECH </p><p>PRODUCTS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. THE U.S. DECISION TO </p><p>INITIATE A CASE, IN PART, IS A MEANS TO STEM THE SPREAD OF </p><p>UNWARRANTED CONCERNS ABOUT BIOTECH PRODUCTS TO COUNTRIES THAT </p><p>WOULD BENEFIT FROM THEIR INTRODUCTION.  ECMIN ADDED THAT OUR </p><p>DECISION TO PURSUE THIS CASE DID NOT IN ANY WAY LESSEN OUR </p><p>COMMITMENT TO WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE EU ON OTHER FRONTS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE DOHA WTO NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) URSO, WHO REITERATED HIS PERSONAL PRO-BIOTECH VIEWS, </p><p>SAID THAT THE U.S. DECISION SEEMED TO BE A STEP BACK IN </p><p>U.S.-EU TRADE RELATIONS, GIVEN RECENT POSITIVE STATEMENTS BY </p><p>USTR ZOELLICK AND EU TRADE COMMISSIONER LAMY ON ADVANCING THE </p><p>DOHA AGENDA.  HE DISMISSED THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANY SOLUTION </p><p>COULD BE FOUND DURING THE INITIAL SIXTY-DAY CONSULTATION </p><p>PERIOD, GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES INVOLVED IN HAVING ALL 15 </p><p>MEMBER STATES TAKE POSITIVE ACTION.  YET URSO THEN PROCEEDED </p><p>TO ADVANCE HIS OWN COMPLICATED IDEA -- THAT THE RANGE OF </p><p>U.S.-EU TRADE DISPUTES (STEEL, FSC, BIOTECH, GEOGRAPHICAL </p><p>INDICATORS, AND EVEN OUR COMPETING WTO AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PROPOSALS) SHOULD BE LINKED IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THEIR </p><p>SIMULTANEOUS RESOLUTION.  HE SUGGESTED THAT EACH ISSUE COULD </p><p>BE NEGOTIATED SEPARATELY BUT IN PARALLEL, WITH THE CLEAR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING THAT TRADEOFFS WOULD BE NECESSARY. (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS IS A FAMILIAR THEME WITH GOI TRADE OFFICIALS, WHO HAVE </p><p>FREQUENTLY SUGGESTED THAT EU GIVE ON BIOTECH MIGHT BE </p><p>POSSIBLE IF THE U.S. SOFTENED ITS STAND OPPOSING THE EU,S </p><p>CALL FOR GREATER PROTECTION WITHIN THE WTO OF GEOGRAPHICAL </p><p>INDICATORS FOR FOODSTUFFS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ECMIN RESPONDED TO URSO,S SUGGESTION BY STATING THE </p><p>U.S. POSITION THAT THESE ARE SEPARATE DISPUTES THAT SHOULD BE </p><p>RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY, EACH ON ITS OWN MERITS.  WE DID NOT </p><p>WANT U.S.-EU BILATERAL DISPUTES TO INTERFERE WITH PROGRESS </p><p>BEING MADE IN THE DOHA ROUND TALKS.  ITALY HAD THE RIGHT TO </p><p>PROPOSE SUCH AN IDEA (URSO SUGGESTED THE JUNE 25 U.S.-EU </p><p>SUMMIT, OR THE MARGINS THEREOF, COULD BE AN APPROPRIATE </p><p>VENUE), BUT RESOLUTION OF THE BIOTECH CASE WOULD NEED TO </p><p>INVOLVE ALL THE RELEVANT PLAYERS (INCLUDING THE COMMISSION, </p><p>THE OTHER EU MEMBER STATES, AND THE WTO CASE CO-COMPLAINANTS </p><p>CANADA, ARGENTINA AND EGYPT).  URSO NEVERTHELESS PERSISTED, </p><p>SAYING HE WOULD DISCUSS THE IDEA OF A "GRAND BARGAIN" WITH </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI, AND PERHAPS AFTERWARD WITH LAMY </p><p>AND WTO DIRECTOR-GENERAL SUPACHAI. (WE UNDERSTAND BOTH MAY </p><p>VISIT ROME THE WEEK OF MAY 19.) </p><p> </p><p>ADDITIONAL GOI REACTION </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) ECONOFF PROVIDED REFTEL MATERIAL ON THE WTO CASE TO </p><p>CLAUDIO SPINEDI, SENIOR ADVISOR TO MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>ECONOMIC COOPERATION GIANDOMENICO MAGLIANO.  SPINEDI TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE GOI SHARES OUR CONCERN THAT THE ADVENT OF A WTO CASE </p><p>NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE DOHA NEGOTIATIONS.  HE </p><p>FURTHER NOTED THAT THE GOI HAS REFRAINED FROM PRESSURING </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON BIOTECH ISSUES (UNTIL RECENTLY </p><p>SPINEDI WAS AN OFFICE DIRECTOR IN THE MFA, DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE BUREAU). WE ALSO LEFT RETEL MATERIAL WITH MASSIMO </p><p>GAIANI, OFFICE DIRECTO FOR EU ENLARGEMENT AND THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>RELATIONS, EUROPEAN INTEGRATION DIRETORATE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) RAFFAEL DE LUTIO, DIPLOMATIC AVISOR TO MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE ALEMANNO, TOLD AMINCOUNSELOR THAT THERE WAS "NO </p><p>REACTION" AT THEMINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE TO THE U.S. </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT  RATHER, MINISTER ALEMANNO WAS VERY CONCERNED </p><p>B AND FOCUSED ON THE APRIL 25 STAKEHOLDERS MEETING N </p><p>BRUSSELS THAT DISCUSSED CO-EXISTENCE.  ACCORDIN TO DE LUTIO, </p><p>THE ITALIAN DELEGATION CAME AWAY FROM THAT MEETING </p><p>PESSIMISTIC THAT BIOTECH CROPS COULD BE GROWN WITHOUT </p><p>"CONTAMINATING HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS". </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT DIRECTOR GENERAL CORRADO CLINI </p><p>TOLD ESTOFF THAT THE WTO CASE WAS NOW A EUROPEAN COMMISSION </p><p>PROBLEM.  HE DOUBTED THAT THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY, ESPECIALLY </p><p>GIVEN THE BERLUSCONI-PRODI STRAINS, WOULD BE INCLINED TO PLAY </p><p>AN ACTIVE ROLE.  HE FORESAW THAT THE GOVERNMENT,S INTERNAL </p><p>PAPER ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EU DIRECTIVE 01/018 IN ITALY </p><p>WOULD NOW STALL, AND THAT THE ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY,S PLAN TO </p><p>MANAGE CONCILIATION OF THE COMMISSION AND EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT </p><p>VERSIONS OF TRACEABILITY AND LABELING WOULD BE PUT ASIDE. HE </p><p>MENTIONED A MAY 28 MEETING BETWEEN MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT </p><p>MATTEOLI AND COMMISSIONER WALLSTROM TO DISCUSS ITALIAN </p><p>PRESIDENCY GOALS, AND ENCOURAGED CONTACT BEFOREHAND BETWEEN </p><p>U/S LARSON AND PM DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA IF </p><p>THE USG WANTED ANY ITALIAN LEADERSHIP TO COME FROM THE MAY 28 </p><p>MEETING.  THINKING MORE EXPANSIVELY, CLINI SUGGESTED PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI MIGHT BEST BE POSITIVELY ENERGIZED ON BIOTECH </p><p>THROUGH COMMUNICATION FROM UK PM BLAIR. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) VITTORIO SILANO, HEAD OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, TOLD US THAT WHILE MINISTER OF HEALTH </p><p>SIRCHIA WAS FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY IN SCIENTIFIC </p><p>TERMS, THE MINISTER HAD DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE DOMESTIC </p><p>POLITICAL DEBATE BECAUSE OF MINAG  ALEMANNO,S STRONG </p><p>"LEADERSHIP" ON THE ISSUE.  SILANO SAID HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY </p><p>BRING THE BACKGROUND PAPERS SUPPORTING THE U.S. DECISION TO </p><p>THE MINISTER, BUT LEFT LITTLE HOPE THAT THE MINISTER MIGHT </p><p>ENGAGE. </p><p></p><p>PRESS REACTION AND PUBLIC DIPLOMACY OUTREACH </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) INITIAL PRESS REACTION HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT RESERVED. </p><p>MOST PRESS ACCOUNTS OF THE U.S. ANNOUNCEMENT STUCK TO THE </p><p>ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD BY THE USG, ALONG WITH SOME OF THE </p><p>WIDELY-REPORTED EU REACTION BUT ALMOST NO GOI REACTION. </p><p>ROME\'S LEFT-LEANING DAILY LA REPUBBLICA HAD A TWO PAGE </p><p>SPREAD, INCLUDING SOME COMMENTARY THAT ATTEMPTED TO LINK THE </p><p>DISPUTE WITH SEEMINGLY UNRELATED ISSUES (U.S. REFUSAL TO JOIN </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, EUROPEAN OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>DEATH PENALTY, ECHELON/PRIVACY, U.S. BOYCOTT OF FRENCH </p><p>PRODUCTS RELATED TO IRAQ). LIKE OTHER PRESS REPORTS, ITS </p><p>COVERAGE DID NOT INCLUDE ANY GOI REACTION -- MOREOVER, IT HAD </p><p>NO COMMENTS FROM NGOS THAT HAVE IN THE PAST EXPRESSED VOCAL </p><p>OPPOSITION TO BIOTECH FOOD. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) PA ROME IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH RELEVANT EMBASSY </p><p>OFFICES (ECON, FAS, SCIENCE) AND THE CONSULATES IN NAPLES, </p><p>MILAN, AND FLORENCE TO DEVELOP A ROBUST PUBLIC DIPLOMACY </p><p>PROGRAM TO SUPPORT USG BIOTECH POLICY IN THE LIGHT OF THE WTO </p><p>CASE. WE HAVE TRANSLATED AND SENT THE USDA PRESS RELEASE ON </p><p>THE WTO CASE TO ITALIAN MEDIA, AND HAVE PLACED IT ON THE </p><p>EMBASSY WEBSITE ALONG WITH OTHER INFORMATION SUPPORTING USG </p><p>BIOTECH POLICY. ON MAY 27-30 WE WILL PARTICIPATE WITH THREE </p><p>U.S. SPEAKERS IN A MAJOR BIOTECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE ("FROM THE </p><p>GREEN REVOLUTION TO THE GENE REVOLUTION") IN BOLOGNA, DURING </p><p>WHICH WE WILL DISSEMINATE INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THE U.S. </p><p>POSITION IN THE WTO CASE. WE ARE ALSO FUNDING A U.S. SPEAKER </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE IN A JUNE 30 CONFERENCE IN MILAN ON "THE GREAT </p><p>PROMISE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY." THE GOAL OF THIS CONFERENCE, </p><p>SPONSORED BY THE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND CONGEN </p><p>MILAN, IS TO PROVIDE A FORUM FOR ITALIAN BUSINESS AND </p><p>ACADEMIC REPRESENTATIVES TO ENCOURAGE THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO TAKE A LESS RESTRICTIVE STANCE TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY. WE WILL USE THE FORUM TO PROMOTE </p><p>THE U.S. POSITION IN THE WTO CASE. IN ADDITION TO THESE </p><p>PROGRAMS, WE ARE SENDING U.S. SPEAKERS TO NAPLES, TURIN, AND </p><p>TRIESTE OVER THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR WEEKS IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN </p><p>AND DEFEND U.S. BIOTECH POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD WE WILL CONTINUE OUR </p><p>PROACTIVE PUBLIC DIPLOMACY OUTREACH TO AUDIENCES THROUGHOUT </p><p>ITALY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT U.S. ARGUMENTS AND POLICIES </p><p>FAVORING BIOTECHNOLOGY AND EXPLAINING THE U.S. POSITION IN </p><p>THE WTO CASE. WE WILL MAKE USE OF VARIOUS RESOURCES (SPEAKER </p><p>PROGRAMS, DIGITAL VIDEO CONFERENCES, MEDIA PLACEMENT, </p><p>INFORMATION DISSEMINATION THROUGH OUR WEBSITE, TARGETED </p><p>E-MAIL DISTRIBUTION OF RELEVANT TEXTS, AND INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>VOLUNTARY VISITOR PROGRAMS) TO PROMOTE USG POLICY AMONG KEY </p><p>POLICYMAKERS AND OPINION LEADERS; AND WE WILL PLACE OP-EDS </p><p>AND INTERVIEWS TO SUPPORT THE U.S. POSITION IN THE WTO CASE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p>2003ROME02150 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
