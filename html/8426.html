(U)  SUMMARY:  Since 1982 the U.S. military has maintained </p><p>a presence at the Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) airbase at </p><p>Soto Cano (commonly known by Hondurans as Palmerola).  The </p><p>base is also the site of the Honduran Air Force Academy. </p><p>Currently, Joint Task Force Bravo (JTF-B) houses more than </p><p>600 U.S. troops and employs more than 700 Hondurans.  Through </p><p>salaries, contracts, tourism and donations, JTF-B contributes </p><p>approximately USD 30 million annually to the Honduran </p><p>economy.  The initial mission of JTF-B was to deter </p><p>aggression from the Nicaraguan National Sandinista Liberation </p><p>Front (FSLN).  Today, U.S. forces train the HOAF; conduct </p><p>bilateral operations in counternarcotics; and provide </p><p>humanitarian assistance, medical emergencies, and disaster </p><p>relief.  JTF-B is also a first responder for natural disaster </p><p>crises for the entire Central American region.  Now some 20 </p><p>years later, with the threat of communism gone, some </p><p>Hondurans continue to question the validity of the U.S. </p><p>presence at Soto Cano.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>U.S. PRESENCE BENEFICIAL </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Since 1982 the U.S. military has maintained a </p><p>presence at the Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) airbase at Soto </p><p>Cano (commonly known by Hondurans as Palmerola).  For the </p><p>HOAF, the base, also the site of the Honduran Air Force </p><p>Academy, represents a strategic relationship with the U.S. </p><p>military.  With the U.S. Southern Command departure from </p><p>Panama in 1999, JTF-B now serves as the principal military </p><p>presence for the U.S. in Central America.  JTF-B is the first </p><p>responder to crises in the region, and supports </p><p>counternarcotics and counterterrorism missions when directed </p><p>from Southern Command.  Moreover, it conducts and supports </p><p>recovery and evacuation operations in all of the Central </p><p>American (CENTAM) region.  Additionally, the task force </p><p>maintains and jointly operates the only C-5 capable airfield </p><p>base in the region.  It provides support for joint combined </p><p>exercises and unit training, theater deployable surgical </p><p>team, all-source intelligence, an operational footprint for </p><p>immediate reaction forces, and maintains pre-positioned </p><p>stocks for theater-wide military operations.  Secondarily, </p><p>JTF-Bravo conducts and supports humanitarian civic assistance </p><p>and military civic action operations, and supports USAID </p><p>disaster relief programs. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>HONDURAN PERSPECTIVE VARIES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Hondurans find themselves sitting on both sides of </p><p>the fence in regards to the U.S. presence at Soto Cano.  On </p><p>the one hand, many recognize the strategic bilateral </p><p>relationship that is maintained between the two countries. </p><p>The training and operation resources provided to the HOAF are </p><p>also recognizably important beneficial aspects of the base. </p><p>Furthermore, the more than USD 30 million in economic </p><p>activity generated by the base makes a direct and significant </p><p>economic impact on the surrounding Comayagua Valley.  On the </p><p>other hand, Honduran critics of the base voice several </p><p>concerns over the JTF-B mission.  First, some knee-jerk </p><p>critics say that the U.S. uses the base more for selfish </p><p>unilateral motives rather than with the intention of helping </p><p>the HOAF and the people of CENTAM in general.  This view </p><p>unfortunately also generates the belief that the U.S. should </p><p>provide Honduras with greater monetary compensation for use </p><p>of the land, above and beyond the rent the USG currently </p><p>pays.  Another criticism is over JTF-B\'s missions.  The </p><p>Committee of Families of the Detained and Disappeared in </p><p>Honduras (COFADEH), a Honduran NGO that focuses on alleged </p><p>human rights abuses from the 1980s and is skeptical of a U.S. </p><p>military role in Honduras, recently criticized JTF-B for </p><p>possible violations of Honduran sovereignty in </p><p>counternarcotics operations.  Often, this type of criticism </p><p>reflects a lack of knowledge of what the base does.  PolOff </p><p>met May 19 with Bertha Oliva de Nativi, the COFADEH General </p><p>Coordinator, to answer her questions and allay her concerns. </p><p>PolOff emphasized that JTF-B undertakes all actions working </p><p>in cooperation with the GOH and referred her to the Ministry </p><p>of Defense if she had more questions about Soto Cano.  PolOff </p><p>is also providing Oliva with public relations information </p><p>from JTF-B. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>COMMERCIAL AIRPORT? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  In August of 2002, President Ricardo Maduro announced </p><p>that he was considering the possibility of converting the </p><p>airstrip at Soto Cano for use by commercial airlines. </p><p>Currently, the small size of the Toncontin airport in </p><p>Tegucigalpa severely limits the type of aircraft that can </p><p>safely land there (reftel).  This primarily affects cargo </p><p>planes used for exportation of Honduran products.  A joint </p><p>commercial-military airport at Soto Cano could mean greater </p><p>commercialization and revenue possibilities for Comayagua and </p><p>the surrounding area, especially for the development of </p><p>textile factories (maquilas).  However, such a project would </p><p>necessitate very careful planning so as not to compromise the </p><p>security and safety of military operations that currently </p><p>take place at the base.  To date, no official plans for a </p><p>civilian airport project have been developed. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  COMMENT:  While a small minority of outspoken </p><p>critics question the motive of a U.S. military presence in </p><p>Honduras, many understand the benefits of having JTF-B </p><p>stationed at Soto Cano.  JTF-B was instrumental in providing </p><p>disaster relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, and </p><p>continues to provide tangible benefits to the host country </p><p>through medical visits and other humanitarian missions.  The </p><p>GOH is also grateful for the monetary contribution JTF-B </p><p>provides to the domestic economy and the stabilizing effect a </p><p>U.S. military presence provides to regional security.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
