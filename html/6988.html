Robert Pearson.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>b and d. </p><p>1. (S/NF) Summary: SPE Zalmay Khalilzad met with a range of </p><p>Iraqi opposition leaders in northern Iraq on March 27-28. </p><p>Discussions with PUK and KDP leadership centered on </p><p>responding to Turkish concerns about northern Iraq, resolving </p><p>the property claims of IDP\'s, and the formation of the Iraqi </p><p>Interim Authority; discussions with the ITF\'s Sanan Aga </p><p>revolved around how to resolve the issue of the ITF joining </p><p>the opposition leadership council; and discussions with the </p><p>INC\'s Ahmad Chalabi centered around his recommendation that </p><p>there be uprisings in Iraq, and that the Iraqi opposition </p><p>assist the U.S. militarily in the fight against Saddam. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p>2. (SBU) Special Presidential Envoy to Free Iraqis Zalmay </p><p>Khalilzad headed a U.S. delegation to northern Iraq on March </p><p>27-28. The delegation met in Suleymaniyah with PUK leader </p><p>Jalal Talabani and other PUK officials, in Dukan with the </p><p>INC\'s Ahmad Chalabi, Sanan Aga of the Iraqi Turkomen Front, </p><p>as well as Talabani again, and in Salahudeen with KDP leader </p><p>Masoud Barzani and other KDP officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PUK Meetings </p><p>------------ </p><p>3. (S/NF) SPE Khalilzad met with Jalal Talabani, PUK "Prime </p><p>Minister" Barham Salih, former PUK "Prime Minister" and </p><p>peshmerga commander Kosrat Rasul Ali and other PUK officials </p><p>on March 27 and 28. With regard to Turkish concerns about </p><p>refugee flows into Turkey, Talabani stated that the threat is </p><p>much different now than in 1991, that Iraqis do not want to </p><p>leave Iraq, and that current refugee flows within northern </p><p>Iraq are minimal. He stated that the PUK already has </p><p>considerable capacity to provide for refugees, asserting that </p><p>the PUK and KDP have coordinated planning efforts, that </p><p>combined PUK and KDP camp capacity is currently 200,000 </p><p>refugees, and that the PUK alone has 10 camps, with </p><p>generators, ready to go. Talabani said that the Kurds could </p><p>increase capacity if provided with tents, medical supplies </p><p>and food, and suggested that international NGOs, which have </p><p>supplies prepositioned, could bring in supplies through Iran </p><p>or Syria. He offered that the Turkish Red Crescent and UN </p><p>were welcome to visit PUK camps to assess capacity, and that </p><p>the PUK would provide maps and pictures of the camps to the </p><p>USG for use with the Turks. </p><p>4. (S/NF) On Turkish worries about increased PKK/KADEK </p><p>terrorism, Talabani stated that the PUK is already sharing </p><p>intelligence on a daily basis with the Turks on the </p><p>PKK/KADEK, for which the Turks have been "grateful." He </p><p>offered that Turkish Red Crescent officials could visit </p><p>refugee camps to check for PKK/KADEK fighters, but asserted </p><p>that "the PKK is afraid now because of the U.S. presence in </p><p>Iraq - they will not move against Turkey, just as the </p><p>Iranians won\'t get involved in Iraq." Talabani believes that </p><p>the PKK wants amnesty, and that the majority of PKK adherents </p><p>would lay down their arms if offered amnesty, but that the </p><p>Turkish military and Turkish nationalist parties oppose </p><p>amnesty. Talabani said that he told Turkey, "If the PKK moves </p><p>against you, we\'re ready to help." He offered that if the </p><p>Turks wanted to send an additional 15 officials to Chwar </p><p>Qurna (just above Dukan Lake) to monitor PKK/KADEK </p><p>activities, he would be amenable to their doing so. </p><p>5. (S/NF) On the subject of potential mass movements of </p><p>people to Kirkuk, and overall property reclamation issues, </p><p>Talabani said that the PUK and KDP have formed a joint </p><p>committee to discourage population movements - "everyone has </p><p>a right to go back, but not unless it\'s in a legal, approved </p><p>manner." He stated that both the PUK and KDP have made public </p><p>statements discouraging Iraqis from taking the law into their </p><p>own hands, and that he would continue to make such statements </p><p>(Note: Talabani did make such a statement at a press </p><p>conference following these meetings). Talabani was </p><p>enthusiastic about SPE Khalilzad\'s description of the </p><p>formation of a commission to deal with property claims, and </p><p>asserted that his preferred structure for the commission </p><p>would be for one senior international figure to be in charge </p><p>(he suggested Bernard Kouchner, Silvio de Mello, George </p><p>Mitchell, Ed Djerijian, Nancy Soderberg or another former </p><p>senior U.S. official). He was very supportive of SPE </p><p>Khalilzad\'s suggestion that, given that the formal property </p><p>claims commission could take some time to set up, an </p><p>additional subcommittee be formed and deployed to towns such </p><p>as Kirkuk as soon as possible to build confidence between the </p><p>various ethnic communities and reassure local populations </p><p>that a formal claims mechanism will be set up. </p><p>6. (S/NF) On the issue of forming the Iraqi Interim Authority </p><p>(IIA), Salih asserted that the UN needed to be involved, "so </p><p>that the US and UK don\'t take the inevitable blame alone." He </p><p>stressed that who the UN representative will be is critical. </p><p>Talabani and Salih were extremely concerned about SCIRI\'s </p><p>role in the leadership council, and did not believe that the </p><p>leadership council should be used as the vehicle to form the </p><p>IIA, as the IIA would then end up with far too many </p><p>Islamists. They both supported the idea of a "Baghdad </p><p>Conference" to form the IIA, and suggested that the </p><p>leadership council could assist in advising on who should be </p><p>invited, although they then caveated that by asserting that </p><p>after liberation, the U.S. should work with the core of the </p><p>opposition that is supportive of the U.S. - KDP, PUK, INA and </p><p>INC. They said that we must work with SCIRI now, "because </p><p>they have the capacity to disrupt things," but following </p><p>liberation advised that we not allow too much Iranian or </p><p>Syrian influence.  They also advised that we engage further </p><p>and encourage non-SCIRI external influential Shi\'a leaders - </p><p>such as Seyyid Mohammed Bahr Al Oluum, Abdulmajid Al Khoie, </p><p>Ibrahim Jaafari, and Shaykh Sahlani (who resides in Los </p><p>Angeles). Talabani asserted that after the war, opposition </p><p>politics will shift dramatically, and there will "immediately </p><p>be two fronts in Iraq - the secular democrats vs. the </p><p>fundamentalists like SCIRI." On the issue of the Iraqi </p><p>Turkmen Front joining the opposition leadership, Talabani </p><p>said he was willing to resolve the issue according to </p><p>whatever agreement SPE Khalilzad was able to negotiate </p><p>between the KDP and ITF. </p><p>7. (S/NF) Talabani disavowed the opposition leadership </p><p>statement that had been issued earlier that day, asserting </p><p>that it differed from what he had provided to the other </p><p>oppositionists, and that SCIRI and Ahmad Chalabi had hijacked </p><p>the statement to serve their desire for a provisional </p><p>government to be formed. He said that he did not support a </p><p>provisional government and instead backed the notion of a </p><p>Baghdad Conference to form the IIA. He did, however, note </p><p>that he would prefer the IIA be called a government, vice an </p><p>authority, but stated that he knew such a change would have </p><p>to be agreed to by the coalition. Talabani named some </p><p>influential contacts that he has inside Iraq (ex-Baathists </p><p>such as Fawzi Fayman, retired General Najib Taleb and Masid </p><p>Shirazi), and offered to provide a list with a range of names </p><p>for us to contact once inside central and southern Iraq.  He </p><p>also recommended secular Shi\'a and former Iraqi Minister of </p><p>Justice Ahmad Haboubi (resides in Cairo) as still very </p><p>influential inside Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KDP Meeting </p><p>----------- </p><p>8. (S/NF) SPE Khalilzad met with Masoud Barzani, KDP "Prime </p><p>Minister" Nechirvan Barzani, KDP "Foreign Minister" Hoshyar </p><p>Zebari, KDP "Deputy Prime Minister" Sami Abdul Rahman, and </p><p>other KDP officials on March 28. Barzani began the meeting by </p><p>thanking SPE Khalilzad for his work with the Turks, stating </p><p>that he was encouraged by the recent changes in Turkish </p><p>statements about northern Iraq. With regard to Turkish </p><p>concerns about refugee flows, Barzani asserted that there </p><p>will not be large refugee flows from northern Iraq since the </p><p>situation is different from 1991 - "there was no clear </p><p>regime-change policy then, and many of the villages that were </p><p>destroyed in Anfal have now been rebuilt, and refugees can </p><p>seek refuge there." Barzani did note that if the Iraqis used </p><p>chemical weapons, it would "be a catastrophe much bigger than </p><p>Turkish or Kurdish concerns." Barzani asserted that the KDP </p><p>has fought the PKK/KADEK for years, and lost thousands of </p><p>peshmerga in doing so. He said that the KDP would never </p><p>accept PKK/KADEK using KDP territory as a base for terrorist </p><p>activities against Turkey, and asserted that he had </p><p>designated three peshmerga divisions to use against the PKK </p><p>if they began to undertake terrorist actions, including </p><p>against Turkey. Barzani stated that "currently, we are </p><p>focused on regime change, but after liberation the U.S., </p><p>Turkey, and the Iraqi Kurds can work together to focus on </p><p>dealing with the PKK." As evidence of his antipathy towards </p><p>the PKK/KADEK, Barzani said that Farhad Ocalan (Abdullah </p><p>Ocalan\'s brother) had recently sent him a telegram offering </p><p>his assistance against Turkey; Barzani said he responded that </p><p>the KDP did not need Ocalan\'s help, rather that he viewed the </p><p>PKK as terrorists, and that the KDP was allied with Turkey </p><p>against the PKK. Barzani also said that the security of </p><p>Turkish troops currently in northern Iraq will be safeguarded </p><p>even in the event of a conflict with Turkey - "they came as </p><p>monitors, and we received them as guests - these particular </p><p>troops should be treated as an exceptional case." </p><p>9. (S/NF) Barzani stated that he has given KDP peshmerga </p><p>clear instructions to not go into Mosul and Kirkuk, and that </p><p>they need to cooperate fully with U.S. commands. He claimed </p><p>that "the KDP has no intention to move into those cities," </p><p>and that he wants to avoid intra-ethnic violence. Barzani </p><p>said that he had made statements recently discouraging people </p><p>from taking the law into their own hands, and would continue </p><p>to do so. (Note: Barzani did make such a statement at a press </p><p>conference following this meeting. End note.) He also said </p><p>that he would meet soon with "influential people from the </p><p>Arabized regions," and would inform them of the KDP\'s stance </p><p>against violence. Barzani was supportive of the idea of a </p><p>property claims commission being set up to address IDP </p><p>property claims. He did not like the idea of the UN </p><p>controlling a commission, and said he\'d get back to us with </p><p>his preferences for its organization shortly. </p><p>10. (S/NF) On the issue of ITF representation on the </p><p>opposition leadership council, Barzani insisted that Turkmen </p><p>from different groups needed to get together, and then could </p><p>jointly choose ITF official Juneyd Mengu as the Turkmen </p><p>representative on the opposition leadership (rather than </p><p>Mengu simply being appointed). He insisted that Mengu would </p><p>have to make a statement upon joining the leadership council </p><p>affirming the results of the London and Salahudeen </p><p>conferences, accepting that Iraq\'s future will be governed by </p><p>the approved Iraqi constitution, and stating that Mengu is </p><p>representative of all Turkmen, not just the ITF. </p><p>11. (S/NF) Like Talabani, Barzani was taken aback by the </p><p>March 27 opposition leadership council statement, asserting </p><p>that he had never seen it, and disagreed with the section </p><p>about a provisional government. He said he supported the idea </p><p>of a Baghdad Conference to form the IIA, and said the UN </p><p>should play a supporting role. He offered to provide the U.S. </p><p>with a list of respected Sunni and Shi\'a figures inside Iraq. </p><p>Barzani firmly stated that the Baghdad Conference cannot be </p><p>based on the "Salahudeen percentages," which he said are not </p><p>accurate or representative of the Iraqi people, and gave </p><p>SCIRI far too big a share of seats. However, he said that we </p><p>need to find some justifiable basis upon which to invite </p><p>Iraqis to the Baghdad Conference. </p><p>12. (S/NF) Nechirvan Barzani stated that because of the </p><p>Turkish fight against the PKK, 10,000 Turks reside in </p><p>northern Iraq, having fled Turkey due to the violence. </p><p>Nechirvan said that Turkish MFA U/S Ugur Ziyal and TGS had </p><p>approached him in Ankara about permitting those 10,000 </p><p>refugees to return to Turkey now.  Nechirvan said that the </p><p>KDP would not let those refugees return in the immediate </p><p>future, as they feared that the Turks would assert that they </p><p>were part of a problematic refugee flow into Turkey from </p><p>northern Iraq, thus justifying a Turkish military move into </p><p>northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ITF Meeting </p><p>----------- </p><p>13. (S/NF) ITF leader Sanan Aga reneged on his earlier pledge </p><p>to SPE Khalilzad that in order to join the opposition </p><p>leadership council, he would sign a letter stating that he </p><p>accepted the principles of the London and Salahudeen </p><p>conferences, as well as  acknowledge that he would recognize </p><p>the official Iraqi names for various regions of Iraq, </p><p>including "Iraqi Kurdistan." Aga stated that he did not </p><p>accept the terminology "Iraqi Kurdistan." He initially stated </p><p>that he did accept the principles of the London conference </p><p>(except for federalism) but later walked back from that, </p><p>explaining that he needed to check with the rest of the ITF </p><p>as to whether that was acceptable. Following the meeting, he </p><p>sent SPE Khalilzad a letter dated March 29, 2003, that reads </p><p>as follows (informal translation from Arabic): </p><p>Begin text of letter: </p><p>The Iraqi Turkmen Front accepts the following points: </p><p>a) Enabling the Iraqi people to build a fully representative </p><p>and democratic government that meets international standards, </p><p>including free and fair elections, respect for the rule of </p><p>law and private property, equality before the law and respect </p><p>for human rights, consistent with principles agreed by the </p><p>opposition at the London Conference, and in light of the </p><p>Iraqi opposition movement meeting held in Ankara on 19 March </p><p>2003, with the participation of the US and Turkey. </p><p>b) That the consitution and future political system of Iraq </p><p>should be determined through the full participation and free </p><p>consent of the totality of the Iraqi people. </p><p>End text of letter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Chalabi Meetings </p><p>---------------- </p><p>14. (S/NF) Ahmad Chalabi met twice with SPE Khalilzad on </p><p>March 27, bringing a variety of former Iraqi military </p><p>officers (including General Mehdi Dulaymi, Colonel Ahmad </p><p>Samarrai, General Talal Obaidi), Qayser Wutwut, and Mudhar </p><p>Shawkat to the second lengthier meeting. Chalabi asserted </p><p>that there needs to be an uprising of the Iraqi people, and </p><p>that the USG should stop telling them not to rebel, and </p><p>instead encourage uprisings. He urged the U.S. to destroy </p><p>Saddam Hussein\'s TV and media capabilities. Chalabi was </p><p>adamant that the Kurdish peshmerga not be used in any attack </p><p>on Kirkuk, and said he was greatly concerned by reports that </p><p>the peshmerga were now 15 kilometers outside Kirkuk. He </p><p>recommended that the "joint command of the Iraqi opposition </p><p>forces" be immediately activated. Chalabi and the military </p><p>officers present were disparaging of U.S. military operations </p><p>in Iraq, stating that the U.S. had made a major mistake by </p><p>not including the opposition in their efforts (Note: None of </p><p>the oppositionists present made any reference to the Free </p><p>Iraqi Forces set up by the USG. End note). Chalabi asserted </p><p>that INC forces, which he claimed were 4,000 strong, should </p><p>be launched from northern Iraq to fight the Iraqi military, </p><p>and said that he was preparing operational plans to submit to </p><p>the Pentagon. </p><p>15. (S/NF) Chalabi said he supported the ITF joining the </p><p>opposition leadership council, as long as they stated that </p><p>"we support the Salahudeen conference, and accept the process </p><p>of selecting and completing the opposition leadership </p><p>council." </p><p>16. (S/NF) Comment: We need a senior diplomatic presence in </p><p>northern Iraq as soon as possible, to be the eyes and ears of </p><p>Washington in the area, and to liaise closely with the Iraqi </p><p>oppositionists in the north to ensure that they do not </p><p>undertake any actions unhelpful to U.S. goals. End Comment. </p><p>17. (U) This cable has been cleared by SPE Khalilzad. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
