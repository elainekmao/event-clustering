<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001535 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LIMA FOR WILL SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KJUS, GT, UN, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: HELEN MACK\'S TAKE ON JUSTICE, POLITICS, AND CICIACS </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1191 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Human Rights Officer Katharine Read, reasons 1.5 (b & d) </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  On June 13, Helen Mack had breakfast at the </p><p>residence with the Ambassador and Human Rights Officer to </p><p>discuss the Supreme Court appeal in her case set for June 19, </p><p>the latest political alliance between Oscar Berger and </p><p>Eduardo Stein, the mixed commission to investigate </p><p>clandestine groups (CICIACS), and other reform-minded </p><p>proposals.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Mack Appeal Hits Supreme Court </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>2. (C) Helen Mack informed us that on June 19 the Supreme </p><p>Court will hear her appeal of the Fourth Appeals Court\'s May </p><p>7, 2003, decision to annul the October 3, 2002 conviction of </p><p>Juan Valencia Osorio for ordering the murder of Helen\'s </p><p>sister Myrna Mack (reftel).  The Ambassador asked Mack if she </p><p>would like him to attend the appeal, and she answered that </p><p>she always appreciates his presence and support.  The </p><p>Ambassador promised to attend the oral appeal on June 19, and </p><p>to rally the international community\'s support by calling his </p><p>Ambassadorial-level colleagues.  (Initial results of these </p><p>calls indicate we can get a good turnout.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Mack told the Ambassador that ret. General Rios Montt </p><p>told her directly that her case would not result in a </p><p>conviction, but that the Gerardi murder case would, </p><p>ultimately.  Mack opined that this was because her sister\'s </p><p>murder was part of the GOG\'s counterinsurgency policies </p><p>during the internal conflict, while Bishop Gerardi was </p><p>allegedly murdered by renegade Presidential Military Staff </p><p>(EMP) officers in 1998, after the signature of the Peace </p><p>Accords.  Comment: It seems strange that Rios Montt would </p><p>speak so boldly about outcomes that imply FRG/Army influence, </p><p>but Mack says he did. </p><p> </p><p>Political Shuffling </p><p>------------------- </p><p>4. (C) Mack told the Ambassador that she favored the </p><p>incorporation of Eduardo Stein into the Alianza GANA with </p><p>Presidential hopeful Oscar Berger.  She also said that the </p><p>presence of retired General Otto Perez Molina in a Berger </p><p>government might be an important inside ally in the cleansing </p><p>of corrupt GOG institutions and clandestine structures. </p><p> </p><p>CICIACS </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (C) Mack said that Peruvian prosecutor Jose Ugaz, who </p><p>visited here in May, offered three thoughts as to what\'s </p><p>needed to make the CICIACS successful: political buy-in; able </p><p>investigators and sources; and adequate anticorruption laws </p><p>on which to base investigations and prosecutions.  The humans </p><p>rights NGOs have pitched the idea to many of the opposition </p><p>parties effectively, and believe that they will be able to </p><p>obtain political support from the new GOG.  The technical </p><p>team from the UN is slated to come to Guatemala in late June </p><p>or early July, and the NGOs hope that they will recommend </p><p>able experts. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Mack said Ugaz recommended that the Guatemalans should </p><p>look at the new Peruvian anticorruption laws as potential </p><p>models for the laws that would be necessary to support the </p><p>CICIACS.  The Ambassador pledged to coordinate with Embassy </p><p>Lima to obtain the legal texts and share them with the human </p><p>rights community.  (See Hamilton email to WSmith.) </p><p> </p><p>Other Reforms </p><p>------------- </p><p>7. (C) Concerned with what she believes is Attorney General </p><p>De Leon\'s corruption, Mack said the human rights community is </p><p>considering mounting a case against him.  She said that in </p><p>the case of De Leon, Guatemala is responsible for </p><p>"prosecuting the prosecutor."  In a separate project, Mack </p><p>also wants to work with the National Endowment for Democracy </p><p>(NED) to study how to incorporate reforms into the long-term </p><p>planning of judicial institutions and how to create oversight </p><p>mechanisms that can monitor the budgets of the Public </p><p>Ministry, Police, and Courts. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8. (C) We continue to believe that showing public support for </p><p>justice in the Mack case is crucial to the respect of human </p><p>rights in Guatemala, and the Ambassador will attend the June </p><p>19 hearing.  We also believe Mack\'s proposal for establishing </p><p>mechanisms to monitor implementation of the judicial sector </p><p>budget could represent a major advance in promoting judicial </p><p>integrity.  We will look for additional ways to assist local </p><p>NGO\'s and the GOG in getting CICIACS up and running. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
