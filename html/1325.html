IRVING FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE OPPOSITION MDC TABLED A MOTION IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT OCTOBER 25 THAT BEGINS THE PROCESS FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S IMPEACHMENT.  THE DOCUMENT CITED IN </p><p>DETAIL "VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION" AND "GROSS </p><p>MISCONDUCT" RELATED TO THE PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE, AMONG </p><p>OTHER THINGS, AS THE GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE, MUGABE ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RECONCILIATION POLICY WITH WHITES IS IN </p><p>JEOPARDY AND COULD BE REVOKED.  MUGABE ALSO THREATENED </p><p>TO ARREST WHITE MDC MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND PUT ON </p><p>TRIAL IAN SMITH AND OTHER LEADERS OF THE WHITE RHODESIAN </p><p>REGIME FOR WAR CRIMES.  THERE HAS BEEN NO DISCERNIBLE </p><p>PUBLIC REACTION TO THESE EVENTS IN THE FORM OF PROTESTS </p><p>OR CELEBRATIONS.  IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, THE MDC IS DUE </p><p>TO TABLE A SECOND MOTION THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THE </p><p>PROCEDURE FOR IMPEACHMENT, WHICH IS NOT CLEARLY </p><p>STIPULATED IN THE CONSTITUTION.  THE IMPEACHMENT </p><p>MEASURES RAISE THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL TENSION ANOTHER </p><p>NOTCH AND SET THE STAGE FOR A FINAL SHOWDOWN BETWEEN </p><p>MUGABE AND THE OPPOSITION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) GIBSON SIBANDA, MDC VICE-PRESIDENT AND MP FOR </p><p>THE NKULUMANE SECTION OF BULAWAYO, INTRODUCED IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT OCTOBER 25 A MOTION THAT SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>THE GROUNDS FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06082  01 OF 02  261438Z </p><p>THE MDC PRESENTED THE DOCUMENT ALONG WITH THE SIGNATURES </p><p>OF 56 MDC PARLIAMENTARIANS, THEREBY OBVIATING THE NEED </p><p>FOR A FLOOR VOTE (ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION, 51 </p><p>VOTES, OR MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF PARLIAMENT, ARE </p><p>REQUIRED TO BEGIN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS).  ACCORDING </p><p>TO EDDIE CROSS, THE MDC\'S SECRETARY FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>AFFAIRS, THE FLOOR ERUPTED INTO AN UPROAR WHEN SPEAKER </p><p>MNANGAGWA ACCEPTED THE PETITION AND PROMISED TO "STUDY </p><p>ITS CONTENTS."  ACCORDING TO ONE OUR PRESS CONTACTS, </p><p>MNANGAGWA ANNOUNCED IN PARLIAMENT OCTOBER 26 THAT HE </p><p>WOULD FORM AN IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE THE CHARGES.  TENDAI BITI, MDC MP FOR HARARE </p><p>EAST, HINTED TO US THAT IF MNANGAGWA OBSTRUCTS THE </p><p>OPERATION OF THE COMMITTEE, THE MDC WILL TAKE HIM TO </p><p>COURT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) DESPITE MNANGAGWA\'S WARNING NOT TO PUBLISH THE </p><p>CONTENTS OF THE MOTION, ITS DETAILS APPEARED IN OCTOBER </p><p>26\'S EDITION OF THE "DAILY NEWS."  THE MOTION STIPULATES </p><p>THAT MUGABE HAS WILLFULLY VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION BY </p><p>FAILING TO UPHOLD THE LAWS OF ZIMBABWE AND HAS </p><p>"DELIBERATELY, AND IN SOME CASES CALLOUSLY, ENCOURAGED, </p><p>CONDONED, INCITED, AND SUPPORTED BREACHES OF THE LAW." </p><p>IT CITES MUGABE\'S FAILURE TO ENFORCE THE APRIL HIGH </p><p>COURT RULING TO EXPEL FARM INVADERS, AS WELL </p><p>COUNTERMANDING HIS MINISTERS\' ORDERS TO THE POLICE TO </p><p>UPHOLD THE COURT RULING.  THE DOCUMENT ALLEGES THAT </p><p>MUGABE MASTERMINDED THE CAMPAIGN OF PRE-ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE AND CITES HIS PUBLIC THREATS OF DEATH TO THOSE </p><p>WHO WOULD OPPOSE HIM.  THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT SHOULD A </p><p>COMMITTEE FIND THAT THESE ACTIONS DO NOT WARRANT A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06082  01 OF 02  261438Z </p><p>"WILLFUL VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION," THEN MUGABE </p><p>SHOULD BE IMPEACHED ON THE GROUNDS OF "GROSS MISCONDUCT" </p><p>FOR ABUSING HIS POWER OF CLEMENCY (REFERRING TO HIS </p><p>RECENT PARDON OF THE PERPETRATORS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE- </p><p>-SEE REF B), FOR DEPLOYING TROOPS TO THE DRC, AND FOR </p><p>CORRUPTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S REACTION WAS SWIFT AND </p><p>BELLICOSE.  THE ZANU-PF YOUTH WING ASSEMBLED A GROUP OF </p><p>ABOUT 200 DEMONSTRATORS IN FRONT OF PARLIAMENT LATE ON </p><p>OCTOBER 25 TO DENOUNCE THE MDC.  IN ADDRESSING THE CROWD </p><p>AFTER THE IMPEACHMENT MOTION WAS TABLED, MUGABE BLASTED </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S WHITES AND THEIR WESTERN SUPPORTERS, SAYING </p><p>THAT HE MAY REVOKE THE GOVERNMENT\'S RECONCILIATION </p><p>POLICY.  HE THREATENED TO PUT ON TRIAL IAN SMITH AND </p><p>OTHER WHITES FOR GENOCIDE AND OTHER WAR CRIMES COMMITTED </p><p>DURING THE LIBERATION WAR STRUGGLE OF THE 1960S AND </p><p>1970S.  MUGABE FURTHER STATED THAT WHITES, SUCH AS MPS </p><p>DAVID COLTART AND MICHAEL AURET, WOULD "NOT BE FREE FROM </p><p>ARREST."  HE ALSO BLAMED THE BRITISH AND AMERICANS FOR </p><p>HELPING THEIR WHITE FRIENDS TO DERAIL LAND REFORM AND </p><p>FOR TRYING TO "RE-COLONIZE" ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) BITI TOLD US OCTOBER 26 THAT THE MDC WILL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1838 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06082  02 OF 02  261439Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------972747  261439Z /38 </p><p>O 261438Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7460 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006082 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/26/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PROCESS TO IMPEACH ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT BEGINS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06082  02 OF 02  261439Z </p><p> </p><p>APPROACH LEADER OF THE HOUSE PATRICK CHINAMASA TO SEE IF </p><p>THE ZANU-PF SIDE WILL WORK WITH THE MDC IN ESTABLISHING </p><p>THE PROCEDURE FOR IMPEACHMENT BEHIND THE SCENES.  (THE </p><p>PROCEDURE IS NOT SPELLED OUT IN DETAIL IN THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION.)  IF THEY WILL NOT AGREE, THEN THE MDC </p><p>WILL TABLE A SECOND MOTION ON OCTOBER 31 ASKING THE </p><p>STANDING RULES COMMITTEE FOR THE FOLLOWING:  1) AN </p><p>IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF HOUSE MEMBERS IN </p><p>PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF EACH PARTY\'S ELECTED SEATS, </p><p>2) THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT OPERATES IN A QUASI-JUDICIAL </p><p>MANNER BY CALLING WITNESSES TO A PUBLIC HEARING, 3) THAT </p><p>THE COMMITTEE RELEASE A REPORT OF ITS FINDINGS BY </p><p>DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND THAT THE FINDINGS BE OPENED UP FOR </p><p>DEBATE TO THE FULL HOUSE, AND 4) THAT THE VOTE OF </p><p>IMPEACHMENT BE CARRIED OUT BY SECRET BALLOT RATHER THAN </p><p>BY DIVISION (WHERE MPS STAND AND MOVE TO THE "YEA" OR </p><p>"NAY" SIDE OF THE CHAMBER). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SHOULD AN IMPEACHMENT VOTE REACH THE FLOOR AND </p><p>PASS WITH A MINIMUM OF 100 VOTES, MUGABE WOULD </p><p>IMMEDIATELY CEASE TO HOLD OFFICE.  THE SENIOR VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT (SIMON MUZENDA) WOULD BECOME ACTING PRESIDENT </p><p>UNTIL A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION COULD BE HELD WITHIN 90 </p><p>DAYS.  BITI SAID THAT HE DOES NOT EXPECT MANY ZANU-PF </p><p>MPS TO CROSS THE AISLE AND VOTE FOR IMPEACHMENT (AT </p><p>LEAST 43 WOULD HAVE TO DO SO FOR THE MEASURE TO PASS) </p><p>BECAUSE MUGABE MOST LIKELY ISSUED VEILED THREATS AT HIS </p><p>CAUCUS WITH THEM OCTOBER 25.  THE MDC DOES NOT </p><p>REALISTICALLY EXPECT PARLIAMENT TO REMOVE MUGABE FROM </p><p>OFFICE, BITI REITERATED, BUT ITS OBJECTIVES IN PURSUING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06082  02 OF 02  261439Z </p><p>IMPEACHMENT ARE TO BRING PRESSURE AGAINST MUGABE TO </p><p>RESIGN, TO EXPOSE HIS MISDEEDS OF THE LAST YEAR, AND TO </p><p>FORMALLY SPELL OUT THE PROCEDURE FOR PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>IMPEACHMENT.  EDDIE CROSS, ONE OF THE MDC\'S MORE RADICAL </p><p>MEMBERS, TOLD US THAT IF MUGABE DOES NOT AGREE TO STEP </p><p>DOWN BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND CALL NEW ELECTIONS, THE </p><p>MDC WILL ORGANIZE MASS PROTESTS TO FORCE HIM OUT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN NO DISCERNIBLE </p><p>PUBLIC REACTION TO THESE EVENTS IN THE FORM OF PROTESTS </p><p>OR CELEBRATIONS, THE POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE IN HARARE HAS </p><p>BECOME MORE TENSE.  PERHAPS AGAINST THE WISHES OF ITS </p><p>MORE MODERATE MEMBERS, THE MDC APPEARS TO BE </p><p>ACCELERATING TO ITS END-GAME OF FORCING MUGABE FROM </p><p>OFFICE.  BY PURSUING IMPEACHMENT NOW, IT LEAVES ITSELF </p><p>FEW ALTERNATIVES TO MASS ACTION IF IT WISHES TO HOLD ON </p><p>TO ITS CREDIBILITY BEFORE THE SCHEDULED 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  IT RISKS RAISING PUBLIC </p><p>EXPECTATIONS TO A DANGEROUSLY HIGH LEVEL WHEN MUGABE </p><p>SHOWS NO SIGNS OF RELINQUISHING POWER.  MUGABE\'S PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY EXTREME AS HE </p><p>BECOMES MORE ISOLATED DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, </p><p>AND CONVEY AN AIR OF DESPERATION.  IT WOULD NOT BE VERY </p><p>PRACTICAL FOR MUGABE TO ABROGATE THE 1979 AMNESTY </p><p>AGREEMENT THAT PARDONED BOTH SIDES, HIMSELF INCLUDED, OF </p><p>CRIMES COMMITTED IN THE LIBERATION WAR STRUGGLE.  IT </p><p>REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW FAR MUGABE IS WILLING TO GO TO HOLD </p><p>ONTO POWER, BUT THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF THIS YEAR COULD </p><p>POTENTIALLY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06082  02 OF 02  261439Z </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
