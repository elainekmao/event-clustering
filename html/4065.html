(S) Summary:  Nigeria\'s Cabinet states its objections to </p><p>the ICJ ruling on Bakassi, suggests implementation will not </p><p>begin soon, and calls for more bilateral talks.  Meanwhile, </p><p>the Armed Forces are simultaneously on high alert and a huge </p><p>shopping spree.

Nigeria controls about 70% of </p><p>Bakassi and will not withdraw now.  GON hawks might like to </p><p>take the rest, but military action does not seem imminent. </p><p>However, the popular press is inciting the public against </p><p>Cameroon, and popular fervor is mounting.  A minor incident </p><p>could spiral into a major confrontation.  Engagement with </p><p>the GON is required to minimize that risk; we offer some </p><p>thoughts.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary of Nigeria\'s Statement on Bakassi </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Nigeria\'s Federal Executive Council (Cabinet) </p><p>October 23 adopted a statement charging the ICJ with having </p><p>erred in its October 10 decision on the case concerning the </p><p>"Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria." </p><p>The six-page document asserted particularly that: </p><p>-- The UK never had sovereignty over Bakassi and therefore </p><p>could not have ceded it to Germany in 1913; </p><p>-- The ICJ decision was "purely political;" </p><p>-- The French, German and English judges should have </p><p>disqualified themselves because they "acted as judges in </p><p>their own cause;" </p><p>-- Nigeria\'s constitution explicitly recognizes Bakassi as </p><p>part of the Federation and, therefore, inalienable except by </p><p>amendment of the constitution; </p><p>-- Nigeria was "unable to accept the reasoning of the Court" </p><p>that the Maroua Declaration was binding, as Nigeria had </p><p>never ratified it; and </p><p>-- The ICJ ruling did not affect the right of innocent </p><p>passage (to Calabar) of Nigerian naval vessels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Notwithstanding headlines in most major news media </p><p>that Nigeria had "rejected" the ICJ ruling, the statement </p><p>carefully avoids blunt language.  Rather, it argues that "a </p><p>lot of fundamental facts were not taken into consideration" </p><p>and "appeals to all [Nigerian] citizens at home and abroad </p><p>to remain calm, positive and constructive until we can find </p><p>a peaceful solution to the boundary issue between Nigeria </p><p>and Cameroon."  The statement expresses appreciation to </p><p>UNSYG for offering his good offices to broker a meeting </p><p>similar to the September 5 meeting in Paris "with a view to </p><p>effecting reconciliation, normalization of relations and </p><p>good neighborliness.  The GON also "thanks all leaders of </p><p>the international community who have expressed concern and </p><p>reassures them that [Nigeria] will spare no efforts to </p><p>maintain peace."  However, the statement assures Nigerian </p><p>citizens that their interests will be protected.  "For </p><p>Nigeria, ... it is a matter of the welfare and well-being of </p><p>her people on their land." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What Does it Mean (and Not Mean)? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In other words, Nigeria does not explicitly "reject" </p><p>the ICJ decision, nor does it characterize the decision as a </p><p>whole as "unacceptable."  The statement\'s wording is quite </p><p>careful to emphasize the interests of citizens rather than </p><p>the interests of possession of territory that may yield </p><p>valuable natural resources.  Taken as a whole, however, the </p><p>statement does constitute a refusal to accept the ICJ\'s </p><p>reasoning and strongly implies a refusal to implement the </p><p>judgment itself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a meeting with key Chiefs of Mission October 24, </p><p>Foreign Minister Sule Lamido contended that the statement </p><p>attributed to UNSYG\'s spokesman following the September 5 </p><p>meeting held an important error: President Obasanjo had </p><p>never committed to implement the ICJ judgment; President </p><p>Biya had done so, and UNSYG\'s statement had then imputed </p><p>that commitment to Obasanjo as well.  While this claim comes </p><p>a bit late in the sequence of events, it is interesting that </p><p>the GOC\'s brief statement of October 24 (Ref M) states that </p><p>President Biya agreed to conform to the decision "as the </p><p>United Nations Charter requires" and that Cameroon "remains </p><p>disposed to put in place the confidence-building measures </p><p>agreed at Paris between Presidents Obasanjo and Paul Biya." </p><p>The GOC goes on to "energetically hope that the Nigerian </p><p>Government will remain faithful to the undertakings freely </p><p>accepted on September 5."  What Yaounde\'s statement does not </p><p>claim is that Obasanjo specifically agreed to implement the </p><p>ICJ\'s ruling.  MFA Permanent Secretary Hart told the </p><p>Ambassador October 24 that Obasanjo had chosen not to </p><p>correct UNSYG\'s error because the GON did not want to </p><p>undermine Annan and was hoping to continue to draw on his </p><p>good offices to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of </p><p>outstanding issues with Cameroon (See also para 11).  Hart </p><p>went on to say that he did not agree with the issuance of </p><p>the October 24 statement.  Rather, he believed the GON </p><p>should have continued to study the judgment...ad infinitum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Moreover, Hart had told the Ambassador October 7 </p><p>(Ref K) that Abuja sought a "joint implementation committee" </p><p>to manage the post-decision process -- only to call back </p><p>October 10 (before the judgment was read) to clarify the GON </p><p>position (Ref L).  Hart explained that Abuja preferred to </p><p>create a "Reconciliation and Good Neighborliness Committee." </p><p>We believed then, and still believe now, that the GON wants </p><p>to focus GOC attention on the potential benefits of vastly </p><p>improved overall bilateral relations in order to obtain </p><p>Yaounde\'s acquiescence in a gradual and very deliberate </p><p>implementation (or perhaps no implementation) of the aspects </p><p>of the ICJ judgment that trouble Abuja most. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Public Pressures Very Real </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Opinion runs against the ICJ decision by a ratio of </p><p>about 25:1, as measured by media reaction.  Even those who </p><p>favor implementation (mostly lawyers) argue not from the </p><p>heart but from the precepts of international law and the </p><p>GON\'s decision not to dispute ICJ jurisdiction after the GOC </p><p>filed its suit.  The lawyers are themselves a divided lot, </p><p>with well over half backing the GON.  Some of the journalism </p><p>has become downright yellow, with recurring themes of </p><p>"brutal Cameroonian gendarmes" harassing and murdering </p><p>"innocent Nigerian fisherman" and robbing and raping their </p><p>wives and daughters.  Popular nationalism is growing; </p><p>pressure on the GON to "do something" is real and rising. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Is the GON Leading or Following? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) A fundamental problem for the GON is that it never </p><p>prepared the Nigerian public for the eventuality of losing </p><p>the ICJ case -- even as the probability became clearer in </p><p>recent months.  Former Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe </p><p>told us just after the decision was announced that he had </p><p>argued against accepting ICJ jurisdiction when he was </p><p>Nigeria\'s top diplomat but that others, notably lawyer </p><p>Richard Akinjide (now one of the loudest advocates of </p><p>Nigeria refusing to implement the decision), had convinced </p><p>then Head of State Sani Abacha that Nigeria would win. </p><p>(COMMENT:  We understand that Nigeria accepted compulsory </p><p>ICJ jurisdiction in 1965, so it would have had to withdraw </p><p>from the Court to prevent Cameroon\'s complaint from being </p><p>heard.  END COMMENT.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S) Obasanjo and the GON do not want to wage war, but </p><p>neither can they "surrender" Bakassi to Cameroon.  They must </p><p>negotiate a careful course between a bewildered and angry </p><p>public and a watchful, wary court of world opinion.  The GON </p><p>has voiced to the GOF its position that any significant </p><p>French support for Cameroon would be viewed as an unfriendly </p><p>act.  With far more business at stake in Nigeria than in </p><p>Cameroon but its credibility with francophone States also on </p><p>the line, Paris, too, must tread warily.  Over the years, </p><p>London has tried repeatedly to lower Nigerian expectations </p><p>of a major legal victory.  Nigerian officials have privately </p><p>expressed deep chagrin over what they perceive as a lack of </p><p>support from their former colonial ruler and have contrasted </p><p>this stance with their perception that Paris is solidly </p><p>behind Cameroon.  Some have also criticized the U.S.  It is </p><p>far from clear that GON officials understand Cameroon\'s case </p><p>is and always was much stronger.  Indeed, Kingibe\'s account </p><p>of his fruitless effort to convince Abacha to object to ICJ </p><p>jurisdiction suggests that senior Nigerians\' conviction that </p><p>Bakassi was "rightfully" Nigerian might have blinded them to </p><p>the principles of law that led the ICJ to conclude otherwise </p><p>(with just two judges dissenting, one Nigerian and one from </p><p>Sierra Leone).  For now, the Nigerian public stands behind </p><p>its President in seeing the ICJ decision as a manifestation </p><p>of European neo-colonial intentions.  The fact that the </p><p>ICJ\'s presiding judge is a French national is viewed as </p><p>"proof" of this alleged plot.  British High Commissioner </p><p>Philip Thomas\'s public call for Nigeria to respect the ICJ\'s </p><p>ruling following a meeting with Lamido (Para 5) left many </p><p>Nigerians nonplussed.  Meanwhile, the FCO was calling in </p><p>Nigeria\'s High Commissioner to press home London\'s view that </p><p>Obasanjo had undertaken at Paris to implement the ICJ ruling </p><p>and that the GON needed to do just that. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Getting the GON to Lead Constructively </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) What the GON needs quickly in order to keep public </p><p>anger from exploding into more calls for military action -- </p><p>some commentators are already beating the drums of war, but </p><p>they are, for now, in the minority -- is a sign from Yaounde </p><p>that it is willing to negotiate.  The GOC may believe that </p><p>the ICJ victory gives it unassailably high moral ground, but </p><p>the GON sees the ICJ decision as advisory and non-binding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) MFA Permanent Secretary Hart told the Ambassador </p><p>that the GON anticipated there would be another meeting in </p><p>Paris facilitated by UNSYG, probably in mid-November.  If </p><p>this meeting takes place but the GON returns with little in </p><p>hand, pressure for unilateral action is likely to increase. </p><p>Nigerian jingoism could take over. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) An editorial in the Yaounde "Herald" (Ref N) called </p><p>for Cameroonian magnanimity in victory and urged Biya to pay </p><p>a "charm visit" to Abuja in short order.  We believe the </p><p>"Herald" has the right concept and that an enduring peace </p><p>will require Yaounde to: </p><p>-- Agree to some form of joint administration that will </p><p>protect the interests of Bakassi\'s overwhelmingly Nigerian </p><p>inhabitants, to include access to fisheries; </p><p>-- Not attempt to prevent Nigeria from holding elections in </p><p>Bakassi early next year, better still facilitate them; and </p><p>-- Agree in principle to unrestricted Nigerian access to the </p><p>Cross River Channel and work toward a formal agreement in </p><p>that regard, perhaps with international guarantors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) For its part, Nigeria could offer to exploit </p><p>onshore and offshore hydrocarbon deposits jointly at a ratio </p><p>heavily favorable to Cameroon; the oil and gas matter far </p><p>more to Cameroon, whose resources are limited, than to </p><p>Nigeria, whose huge gas reserves are largely untapped and </p><p>whose oil-production capacity in excess of probable OPEC </p><p>quotas is projected to grow steadily over the next decade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Military Preparations </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (S/NF) Senior Nigerians, including the Minister of </p><p>Defense (septel), have made it clear GON forces will not </p><p>budge from the portions of Bakassi they now control but that </p><p>they will fight back if Cameroon attacks.  While Cameroon </p><p>may have no such intention, reporting from several sources </p><p>(Refs E and G give examples) indicates that Nigerian </p><p>intelligence services are warning policy-makers that Yaounde </p><p>is preparing to strike.  Despite his claims in a letter to </p><p>President Bush, Obasanjo is reported in Ref H to have said </p><p>that Nigerian hesitation in reclaiming Bakassi would prove </p><p>"fatal" because Cameroon planned to "strike." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (S/NF) Nigeria\'s Constitution requires the President to </p><p>obtain the National Assembly\'s permission before engaging </p><p>Nigerian forces beyond its borders.  In Ref H, a Senator is </p><p>reported to believe that the Senate would accede to such a </p><p>request.  A Senator who was present at the October 11 </p><p>Federal Security Council meeting where Bakassi was discussed </p><p>told us that he had told Obasanjo, both during the meeting </p><p>and privately, that the National Assembly would not support </p><p>a declaration of war.  The Senator commented to us that the </p><p>legislators suspected that the talk of war was intended </p><p>primarily to rationalize the purchase of weapons systems the </p><p>Armed Forces did not really need.  The only solution to its </p><p>conflict with Cameroon was for Nigeria to negotiate, the </p><p>Senator concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (S/NF) The GON is moving to acquire weaponry that would </p><p>prove useful in an eventual Bakassi conflict, including 12 </p><p>SU-27 ground-attack aircraft and 70-plus 35-foot shallow- </p><p>draft patrol boats (essentially large Zodiacs).  This number </p><p>of boats would be sufficient to move simultaneously most of </p><p>the combat elements of all four battalions currently </p><p>deployed in Bakassi and its immediate vicinity and to </p><p>provide reinforcements and resupply.  Also, the Nigerian </p><p>port of Calabar is closer to Bakassi through less dangerous </p><p>waters than is either Douala or Limbe.  Any Cameroonians </p><p>attempting to resupply Bakassi would be vulnerable to attack </p><p>by Nigerian Alpha Jets, six of which are now operational, </p><p>with four more expected to return to service soon.  Also, </p><p>Nigeria has procured additional Mi-35 attack helicopters, </p><p>including a one-year maintenance contract, from Russia. </p><p>(Refs A-E offer detail on the foregoing). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (S/NF) We have heard that the 20 battalion in Serti </p><p>(near the Cameroonian border but about 500 km from Bakassi), </p><p>which was scheduled to rotate to Sierra Leone, will stay in </p><p>its garrison, with the Katsina-based 35 battalion rotating </p><p>instead.  However, Minister of Defense Danjuma October 25 </p><p>again confirmed to the Ambassador his instructions to the </p><p>Chief of Army Staff to move the Serti battalion to Sierra </p><p>Leone (septel).  We know that Nigerian forces across the </p><p>country have been at a state of heightened alert since early </p><p>October, and that those deployed to Bakassi are at their </p><p>highest state of peacetime alert. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (S) As Obasanjo put it in his October 14  letter to </p><p>President Bush, "The situation is precarious politically. </p><p>We would need the assistance of all parties to ensure that </p><p>any form of confrontation or victor/vanquished posturing is </p><p>discouraged. ...I welcome...your good offices in </p><p>establishing further progress in the solution of the </p><p>problem."  As long as Cameroon does nothing that impacts </p><p>negatively the rights and lives of Bakassi\'s inhabitants and </p><p>as long as there is at least an appearance of progress </p><p>toward a political solution that will restore the status quo </p><p>before the decision, the GON should be able to resist </p><p>pressure to act unilaterally.  In their October 24 meeting, </p><p>MFA Permanent Secretary Hart confessed to the Ambassador </p><p>that the GON was indeed hoping for a restoration of the </p><p>status quo ante and the re-establishment of the 1993 border </p><p>demarcation committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (S) We believe that the GON is speaking in largely </p><p>conciliatory terms with the international community while </p><p>engaging in a major off-budget military build-up in order to </p><p>build and sustain direct and indirect pressure on Cameroon </p><p>to negotiate.  Yaounde would be wise to do so.  As we have </p><p>noted earlier in this message, the balance of forces in and </p><p>around Bakassi favors Abuja, and the Nigeria\'s relative </p><p>advantage is likely to grow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  (S) The GON does not want to face the international </p><p>condemnation (and possible French intervention) that would </p><p>result from it striking against Cameroon.  Obasanjo also has </p><p>little to gain and much to lose under current circumstances; </p><p>already some of our contacts are suggesting in private that </p><p>he might want a war with Cameroon in order to be able to </p><p>invoke the constitutional provision that allows elections to </p><p>be deferred in time of war.  We find this far-fetched, but </p><p>Obasanjo would have to deal with public allegations along </p><p>these lines should fighting break out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.  (S) However, "the situation is precarious politically." </p><p>There is a long history of violent incidents between local </p><p>inhabitants (mostly Nigerians) and Cameroonian gendarmes. </p><p>Nigeria\'s popular press is fanning the embers of resentment. </p><p>Another incident would worsen the climate for dialogue, and </p><p>it could happen at any time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What Should the USG Do? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C) It would be useful for the USG to urge both parties </p><p>to this ongoing dispute -- the ICJ ruling has not effected a </p><p>political settlement both parties will accept -- to renew </p><p>their dialogue, both under the good offices of UNSYG and </p><p>directly.  Senior Nigerians understand that full restoration </p><p>of the status quo ante will be difficult, if not impossible, </p><p>in the wake of the ICJ ruling.  But neither they nor the </p><p>people of Nigeria will agree to (and implement) the major </p><p>changes the ICJ\'s ruling implies.  Creative thinking and </p><p>effective confidence-building measures, along with patience </p><p>on both sides, are key requirements for the serious and </p><p>sustained bilateral engagement that is the only hope of true </p><p>resolution. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
