<p>UNCLAS ROME 000894 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR DRL, EUR, AND PA </p><p> </p><p></p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, ELAB, KSPR, IT, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT:  COUNTRY REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES FOR 2001 </p><p>- REQUEST FOR GUIDANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 28413 </p><p>B. 01 STATE 185194 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (SBU) SEVERAL POINTS IN THE ITALY CHAPTER OF THE 2001 </p><p>COUNTRY REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES (HRR) REPRESENT </p><p>DEPARTURES FROM PREVIOUS PRACTICE.  ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE </p><p>NATURE OF SOME OF THE CHANGES, WHICH MAY BE PERCEIVED AS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT IN THE CONTEXT OF DOMESTIC ITALIAN POLITICS, WE </p><p>EXPECT TO RECEIVE INQUIRIES FROM EITHER GOI INTERLOCUTORS OR </p><p>THE PRESS.  THIS MESSAGE REQUESTS DEPT GUIDANCE WE CAN USE IN </p><p>RESPONDING TO SOME OF THE INQUIRIES THESE CHANGES MAY PROMPT. </p><p>WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF WAYS WE CAN MAKE </p><p>CLEAR THAT, DESPITE THE CHANGES INSERTED INTO THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>REPORT, WE ARE NOT TAKING SIDES IN ITALY\'S LOUD AND </p><p>ACRIMONIOUS POLITICAL DEBATE BETWEEN THE CENTER-LEFT AND </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOI "GENERALLY" RESPECTS CERTAIN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>2.  (SBU) Q: WE NOTE THAT THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT\'S HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS PERFORMANCE SCORES LOWER (IN THE 2001 HRR) THAN DID </p><p>PREDECESSOR CENTER-LEFT GOVERNMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SAY </p><p>THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT ONLY "GENERALLY" RESPECTED THE </p><p>JUDICIARY\'S INDEPENDENCE (SECTION 1.E), FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND </p><p>THE PRESS (SECTION 2.A), AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM (SECTION 2.C). </p><p>YOU ALSO NOTE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS, UNDER BERLUSCONI, </p><p>"IN GENERAL" OPERATE WITHOUT GOVERNMENT RESTRICTION (SECTION </p><p>4).  PREVIOUS HRRS SAID THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT "RESPECTS </p><p>(THESE RIGHTS) IN PRACTICE."  DOES THIS MEAN THE USG </p><p>PERCEIVES DETERIORATING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS BY ITALY\'S </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT GOVERNMENT? </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) POST COMMENT: IN YOUR RESPONSE, PLEASE ACCOUNT FOR </p><p>ANOMALOUS EVALUATIONS IN THE 2001 HRR THAT GIVE THE GOI A </p><p>CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH (E.G., SECTION 2.A ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM, </p><p>SECTION 6.A ON THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION, SECTION 6.B ON THE </p><p>RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY). </p><p> </p><p>WHAT DOES "GENERALLY RESPECTS" MEAN? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>4.  (SBU) POST BACKGROUND COMMENT: PER REF B, DEPT ADVISED </p><p>THAT "THE PHRASE \'GENERALLY RESPECTS\' IS USED...BECAUSE THE </p><p>PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A SITUATION THAT </p><p>IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND EVOLVING, AND IT CANNOT ACCURATELY </p><p>BE STATED THAT ANY GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>FULLY PROTECTS THESE RIGHTS WITHOUT QUALIFICATION IN EVEN THE </p><p>BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES."  IN USING THIS LANGUAGE TO EXLAIN </p><p>THE MEANING OF "GENERALLY RESPECTS," IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO </p><p>HAVE RESPONSES TO FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS SUCH AS: </p><p> </p><p>-- Q: THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF "GENERALLY" IS "ON THE </p><p>WHOLE," "AS A RULE," "IN MOST (BUT NOT ALL) INSTANCES."  SO, </p><p>WHAT ARE THE INSTANCES IN 2001 ON WHICH THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT DIDN\'T RESPECT THE JUDICIARY\'S INDEPENDENCE (OR </p><p>"FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE PRESS" OR "RELIGIOUS REEDOM")? </p><p>-- Q: THE HRR HAS MULTIPLE EXAMPLES OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN </p><p>SOME AREAS (E.G., SECTION 1.C ON SECURITY FORCE MISTREATMENT </p><p>OF ANTI-GLOBALIZATION DEMONSTRATORS IN NAPLES AND GENOA) BUT </p><p>NONE IN THESE (I.E., PARA 2 ABOVE).  COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE US </p><p>SOME SPECIFIC INSTANCES IN 2001 WHEN FREEDOM OF SPEECH </p><p>(PRESS/RELIGION/ETC.) WAS VIOLATED? </p><p> </p><p>-- Q: THE 2000 HRR REPORTS ON FRANCE AND GERMANY SAY THEY </p><p>"GENERALLY" RESPECT FREEDOM OFRELIGION.  BUT THESE REPORTS </p><p>REFER TO PROBLEMS SUCH AS CLOTHING BANS IN SCHOOLS (THAT </p><p>AFFECT MUSLIMS), LIMITATIONS ON RELIGIOUS SLAUGHTER, AND </p><p>MEASURES DIRECTED AGAINST "SECTS," ESPECIALLY SCIENTOLOGY AND </p><p>JEHOVAH\'S WITNESSES.  AS THE REPORT ON ITALY DOESN\'T MENTION </p><p>SIMILAR LIMITATIONS, WHY IS THE SAME LANGUAGE USED TO </p><p>DESCRIBE APPARENTLY DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CONDITIONS? </p><p> </p><p>INTERNAL INCONSISTENCY? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU) Q: WE NOTE THAT IN ONE PLACE (SECTION 1.E) THE </p><p>REPORT SAYS THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>JUDICIARY AND THE GOVERNMENT "GENERALLY RESPECTS" THIS </p><p>PROVISION.  IN ANOTHER PLACE (INTRODUCTION) THE REPORT SAYS </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT "RESPECTS" THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION FOR AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY.  THESE SENTENCES APPEAR TO SAY TWO </p><p>DIFFERENT THINGS.  IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S VIEW, DOES THE </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT "RESPECT" AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY OR </p><p>NOT? </p><p> </p><p>ARBITRARY OR UNLAWFUL DEPRIVATION OF LIFE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (SBU) Q: SECTION 1.A IS HEADED, "ARBITRARY OR UNLAWFUL </p><p>DEPRIVATION OF LIFE."  ONE PARAGRAPH IN THIS SECTION REFERS </p><p>TO THE RED BRIGADES\' COLD-BLOODED ASSASSINATION IN MAY 1999 </p><p>OF LABOR MINISTRY ADVISER MASSIMO D\'ANTONA.  ANOTHER </p><p>PARAGRAPH REFERS TO THE JULY 2001 SHOOTING OF A DEMONSTRATOR </p><p>WHO WAS PART OF A MOB ATTACKING "AN ISOLATED JEEP WITH THREE </p><p>POLICE OFFICERS."  WHY DOES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONSIDER THIS </p><p>LATTER INCIDENT TO BE ARBITRARY OR UNLAWFUL DEPRIVATION OF </p><p>LIFE? </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) FOLLOW-UP Q: POLICE UNDER ATTACK IN PREVIOUS YEARS </p><p>HAVE ALSO FIRED ON AND KILLED THEIR ASSAILANTS.  BUT SUCH </p><p>INSTANCES WERE NEVER MENTIONED IN THE HRR SECTION ON </p><p>"ARBITRARY OR UNLAWFUL DEPRIVATION OF LIFE."  WHAT MAKES THIS </p><p>PARTICULAR CASE ARBITRARY AND UNLAWFUL? </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) FOLLOW-UP Q: DOES THE USG CONSIDER EVERY DEATH BY </p><p>SHOOTING BY AN AMERICAN POLICEMAN TO BE POTENTIALLY UNLAWFUL </p><p>OR ARBITRARY? </p><p> </p><p></p><p>DEADLINE </p><p>-------- </p><p>9.  (U) PER REF A, THE HRR WILL BE PUBLICLY RELEASED AT </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 12:00 NOON TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, I.E., 6:00 </p><p>P.M. ROME TIME.  WE WILL NEED RESPONSES TO THESE QUESTIONS </p><p>NLT WEDNESDAY MORNING (ROME TIME), FEBRUARY 27. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
