UNDER HEADLINE "NEW POLITICAL CULTURE OVERDUE," </p><p>   THE </p><p>   GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" USED ITS </p><p>   MARCH 20 EDITORIAL TO CALL ON THE TWO MAJOR </p><p>   POLITICAL PARTIES - ZANU PF AND MDC - IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>   TO CO-EXIST, SAYING THE PARTIES " HAVE TO LEARN TO </p><p>   LIVE TOGETHER, ARGUE TOGETHER AND OPPOSE EACH OTHER </p><p>   IN A WAY THAT BUILDS ZIMBABWE."  EXCERPTS: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ". . .ZIMBABWE IS LONG OVERDUE FOR A CHANGE IN THE </p><p>   WAY IT REGARDS POLITICS.  OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THE </p><p>   COUNTRY HAS LIVED WITH A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM.  YET THERE </p><p>   ARE FAR TOO MANY REMNANTS OF A CULTURE WHERE THERE WAS </p><p>   JUST ONE DOMINANT PARTY AND A BUNCH OF HAS-BEENS </p><p>   PROVIDING A TRIVIAL OPPOSITION.  REGRETTABLY, THE </p><p>   INHERITED SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT FROM THE COLONIAL DAYS </p><p>   WAS ALSO BUILT AROUND THE IDEA OF A MONOLITHIC RULING </p><p>   PARTY. . . </p><p> </p><p>   "THE FIRST CONCEPT WE NEED TO INTRODUCE INTO A NEW </p><p>   POLITICAL CULTURE IS THAT THE OTHER PARTY IS NOT </p><p>   THE ENEMY.  THE OTHER PARTY MIGHT BE WRONG, IT </p><p>   MIGHT EVEN BE PIGHEADED, BUT IT IS STILL PART OF </p><p>   ZIMBABWE AND HAS TO BE REGARDED AS SUCH.  PARTIES </p><p>   CAN OPPOSE EACH OTHER, AND DO SO VIGOROUSLY, BUT </p><p>   THEIR AIM SHOULD NOT BE TO DESTROY EACH OTHER.  THE </p><p>   SECOND THING WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IS THAT THE DAYS OF </p><p>   A MONOLITHIC PARTY ARE GONE, FOREVER. . . </p><p> </p><p>   "IN SHORT, TALKS BETWEEN ZANU PF AND THE MDC SHOULD </p><p>   NOT DWELL TOO MUCH ON TRYING TO FIND COMMON GROUND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00727  200846Z </p><p>   IN POLICY.  THEY DIFFER TOO MUCH.  ONE OR THE OTHER </p><p>   WOULD HAVE TO SELL OUT IN ITS CORE BELIEFS.  BUT </p><p>   PARTIES SHOULD HELP CREATE AND SUSTAIN A NEW </p><p>   POLITICAL CULTURE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE </p><p>   REALITY OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE HAVE TWO LARGE, WELL- </p><p>   SUPPORTED PARTIES LED BY THE ONLY TWO MEN EVER TO </p><p>   WIN MORE THAN 1 MILLION VOTES IN A ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>   ELECTION.  WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER, ARGUE </p><p>   TOGETHER AND OPPOSE EACH OTHER IN A WAY THAT BUILDS </p><p>   ZIMBABWE.  THAT IS THE CHALLENGE." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
