SUMMARY:  THE FALL OF TIKRIT TO COALITION FORCES, THE IN </p><p>IRAQI CITIES, AND USG WARNINGS TO SYRIA DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE </p><p>MEDIA.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL ALLEGED THAT IRAQ WAS FIRST BUT </p><p>SYRIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NEXT.

IN A RARE OP-ED, UAE NATIONAL GULF NEWS EDITOR-IN- </p><p>CHIEF ABDUL HAMID AHMAD PROCLAIMED THAT AUTHORITARIAN ARAB </p><p>REGIMES MUST PURSUE DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND STOP USING THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS AS AN EXCUSE TO JUSTIFY THE REPRESSION OF THEIR </p><p>PEOPLES.

ANWAR GARGASH WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL ABU DHABI-BASED ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD" ON 4/14: </p><p> </p><p>"... OUR ARAB WORLD IS FACED WITH A HISTORICAL CHANCE THAT </p><p>SYMBOLIZES THE END OF THE ARAB HISTORY AS WE KNOW IT - A HISTORY </p><p>OF HYPOCRISY, CORRUPTION, OPPRESSION, AND SETBACKS DURING RECENT </p><p>DECADES.  IT IS TIME TO REPLACE THE VOID SLOGANS AND ILLUSIONS </p><p>THAT OCCURRED IN LOSING THE ARAB COMPASS, WITH A WORKING METHOD </p><p>TO SANCTIFY HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO GUARANTEE POLITICAL RIGHTS AND A </p><p>DECENT LIFE FOR EVERY ARAB." </p><p> </p><p>3.

EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK\'S WARNING OF A CIVIL WAR IN </p><p>IRAQ SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED AND DEALT WITH ... THE FIRE </p><p>THREATENING THE REGION, STARTING WITH THE ONE IN IRAQ, OPENS THE </p><p>DOOR TO FEARS THAT ARE NOT ELIMINATED WITH AMERICAN PROMISES AND </p><p>REASSURANCES THAT WASHINGTON SHOWERS (US) WITH DEMOCRACY, </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, AND MORE.  THE EVIL COMPANIES AND ISRAELI INTERESTS </p><p>THAT CONTROL AMERICAN DECISIONS THAT REFUTE ALL RUMORS REGARDING </p><p>THIS SITUATION ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON SADDAM\'S TREATMENT OF HIS PEOPLE, "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 4/14: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT THE WORLD SAW IN THE VAULTS, SECRET TUNNELS, AND </p><p>TORTURE EQUIPMENT IN THE HOUSES OF EVIL, IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>GRAVES, GROUP GRAVES, AND THE REMAINS OF UNKNOWN PEOPLE, IS ONLY </p><p>THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG FLOATING ON THE SURFACE, MADE OF BODIES </p><p>AND THE SUFFERING OF MILLIONS OVER THE LAST 35 YEARS.  THE SOULS </p><p>OF THE VICTIMS ARE STILL FLYING OVER WHERE THEY WERE KILLED, AND </p><p>THE ECHOES OF THE MOANS OF THE TORTURED STILL LOOM IN MANY </p><p>HOUSES." </p><p> </p><p>5.  NOTING THAT THE WORLD IS ASKING THE COALITION FORCES TO END </p><p>THE CHAOS IN IRAQ INSTEAD OF ENDING THEIR OCCUPATION, "AL- </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 4/13: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE ORGANIZED CHAOS IN IRAQI CITIES DURING THE LAST COUPLE </p><p>OF DAYS IS ONLY BUT A DROP IN THE SEA OF THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE, </p><p>IN WHICH THE U.S. AND UK WANT IRAQ TO DROWN IN ORDER TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THEIR OCCUPATION ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  CRITICIZING THE ARAB POLICY TOWARDS IRAQ AND COMPARING IT TO </p><p>THE FRENCH POLICY, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL- </p><p>BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 4/13: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE ARAB LEAGUE AND ARAB COUNTRIES ARE REQUESTED TO MOVE </p><p>TOWARDS PROTECTING NOT ONLY IRAQ AND SYRIA, BUT ALSO ALL ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT SOONER OR LATER FIND THEMSELVES AN AMERICAN </p><p>TARGET ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENTING ON THE RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ, "AL-ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 4/13: </p><p> </p><p>"... REBUILDING A NEW IRAQ AFTER ALL THIS DESTRUCTION WILL NOT </p><p>HAPPEN EXCEPT WITH THE HANDS OF ITS PEOPLE AND ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN ALL POWERS AND POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND </p><p>CULTURAL GROUPS IN THE IRAQI COMMUNITY.  THIS IS THE BATTLE FOR </p><p>IRAQIS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN A CLOSING STATEMENT IN "AL BAYAN," SALIM WROTE: </p><p> </p><p>"THE LOOTING THAT THE IRAQI CITIES ARE WITNESSING UNDER THE EYES </p><p>AND EARS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPYING FORCES IS DONE BY ROBBERS AND </p><p>GANGS ... THIS REVEALS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MOTTO OF LIBERATION </p><p>ESPOUSED BY WASHINGTON TO JUSTIFY ITS ATTACKS AGAINST IRAQ.  THIS </p><p>IS A LIBERATION OF IRAQI CITIES FROM SECURITY AND LEAVES THE </p><p>THESE CITIES FOR ROBBERS TO LOOT, EXCEPT FOR THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>PETROLEUM AND OIL REFINERIES AND WELLS, WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN </p><p>LOOTERS WHO COME FROM OVERSEAS." </p><p> </p><p>9.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "THE IRAQI TREMOR AND ITS KEY LESSON FOR </p><p>ALL,"  UAE NATIONAL EDITOR-IN-CHIEF ABDUL HAMID AHMAD WROTE IN AN </p><p>OP-ED IN EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED ENGLISH DAILY "GULF NEWS" ON 4/14: </p><p>"THE COLLAPSE OF THE IRAQI BA\'ATH PARTY HAS LONG BEEN ANTICIPATED </p><p>... THE REGIME SUPPRESSED FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY IN ECONOMIC, </p><p>POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL FIELDS - IN FACT, ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE ... </p><p>THE IRAQI EXPERIENCE IS SIMILAR TO THE EXPERIENCE OF ALGERIA, </p><p>SYRIA, YEMEN, AND OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES RULED BY SUCH FORCES AND </p><p>NATIONAL PARTIES THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY TOTALITARIANISM AND </p><p>RULE BY ONE ... SINGLE PARTY MONOPOLY SUPPRESSES ALL TYPES OF </p><p>POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND ONLY LEADS TO THE SUFFOCATION OF </p><p>PEOPLE, POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY.  THE (BA\'ATH) PARTY\'S ACTIONS </p><p>AND THE MONOPOLY OF POWER BY AN UNQUALIFIED CLIQUE - EXCEPT FOR </p><p>ITS INSATIABLE DESIRE TO TERRORISE IT OWN PEOPLE AND NEIGHBORS - </p><p>IS A STRONG LESSON THAT ARABS SHOULD LEARN FROM." </p><p> </p><p>"... IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE IS JUST AN EXCUSE </p><p>FOR THESE REGIMES TO JUSTIFY THE REPRESSION OF THEIR PEOPLE AND </p><p>THEIR MONOPOLY OF POWER.  IT IS AS IF PALESTINE CAN ONLY BE </p><p>LIBERATED THROUGH REPRESSION SIMPLY BECAUSE THESE REGIMES HAVE </p><p>CLAIMED DEMOCRACY WILL NOT ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THIS DREAM." </p><p> </p><p>"WE SHOULD NOT START LOOKING FOR EXPLANATIONS AS TO WHY IT </p><p>HAPPENED, BECAUSE DICTATORSHIPS CAN ONLY LEAD TO DESTRUCTION AS </p><p>WAS THE CASE IN IRAQ ... THE TIME HAS COME FOR US ARABS TO </p><p>REALIZE AND LEARN FROM WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
