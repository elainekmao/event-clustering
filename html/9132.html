<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001589 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ECON, YM, ENERGY, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: RUMORED OIL FIND NOT ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN ROYG ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by Ambassador E.J. Hull for reasons 1.5. (B.) </p><p> and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Rumors are circulating in Sanaa that an oil </p><p>discovery by Canadian Nexen could contain over a billion </p><p>barrels of oil.  Earlier, Ministry of Oil officials expressed </p><p>optimism that new oil finds in Yemen could maintain current </p><p>production levels indefinitely, in spite of their own </p><p>Ministry\'s predictions that oil output could decline as much </p><p>as one third by 2010.  Nevertheless, even with Yemen\'s oil </p><p>production at an all time high and last year\'s inflated oil </p><p>prices, the economy for 2002 did not expand as fast as </p><p>population growth. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Rumors of Big Oil Find </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AbdulGhani Al-Iryani, Chairman of Rayman Trading </p><p>Company and member of the prominent al-Iryani family in </p><p>Yemen, told Pol/econoff on June 25th that there were several </p><p>rumors that Canadian Nexen has discovered a huge oil field, </p><p>perhaps in the billions of barrels of oil. Al-Iryani cited as </p><p>evidence two news stories on Al-Jazeera and in the daily </p><p>newspaper Al-Ayyam announcing new finds in Canadian Nexen\'s </p><p>Block 14 in the Hadramawt governorate. (Note: According to </p><p>the Petroleum Exploration and Production Authority, Yemen\'s </p><p>proven oil reserves are just over 4 billion barrels. End </p><p>Note.) Canadian Nexen officials are reluctant to comment on </p><p>the find, but have confirmed to Embassy officials that there </p><p>have been new discoveries. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Ministry of Oil and Minerals Sanguine about Future </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In an earlier courtesy call with Nabil al-Gawsi on </p><p>June 10, Chairman of the Petroleum Exploration and Production </p><p>Authority (PEPA) of the Ministry of Oil and Minerals, </p><p>al-Gawsi expressed optimism that present high production </p><p>rates of 450,000 barrels a day could be maintained, possibly </p><p>slipping slightly to 400,000 barrels per day in the future. </p><p>When asked to respond to most experts\' prediction that oil </p><p>production  will decline significantly in the next ten years, </p><p> Al-Gawsi countered that he believed there was still a great </p><p>deal of oil to be found. He confirmed that Canadian Nexen had </p><p>found oil in concession area 14, near in Hadramawt. Al-Gawsi </p><p>did not comment on the size of the discovery.  (Note: The </p><p>Ministry of Oil has publicly estimated in 2001 that by 2010 </p><p>production would drop to 1/3 of today\'s levels, around </p><p>145,000 barrels a day. End Note.) Al-Gawsi also promoted </p><p>recently opened oil concessions along the border with Saudi </p><p>Arabia, which have recently opened for exploration after the </p><p>conclusion of the 2000 border agreement with Saudi Arabia. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Expressing some frustration with Hunt Oil, al-Gawsi </p><p>said that there was likely more oil in Hunt\'s concession near </p><p>Marib than Hunt would extract. The concession might be opened </p><p>to other companies if Hunt leaves after their PSA expires in </p><p>2005. Closing by promising a bright future for oil in Yemen, </p><p>al-Gawsi said only 3% of all the oil concessions have been </p><p>explored, and was positive there were still more reserves to </p><p>be discovered. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>New Finds Aside, </p><p>Oil Not the Solution to Yemen\'s Economic Woes </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: The rumored oil find explains the optimism </p><p>of al-Gawsi and his coworkers at PEPA and will likely delay </p><p>the ROYG\'s having to compensate for revenue losses due to </p><p>diminished oil production. The rumored size of the find is </p><p>undoubtedly exaggerated. Most likely, al-Gawsi is more on </p><p>target with his expectation that new finds will maintain </p><p>current oil production levels. While new oil finds are good </p><p>news for government revenue, oil is not a panacea for the </p><p>ROYG economy. Last year\'s high oil prices and record oil </p><p>production levels only accounted for 2.9% GDP growth (World </p><p>Bank Statistic) for Yemen in 2002, which did not match the </p><p>ROYG\'s published population growth estimate of 3.5%.  Keeping </p><p>in mind that oil prices are expected to fall next year, </p><p>simply maintaining current production levels will translate </p><p>into even slower GDP growth, and most likely a budget deficit </p><p>for the ROYG in 2004.  End Comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
