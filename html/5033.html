<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 008026 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CH, KN, KS </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S KELLY DISCUSSES KOREA, BILATERAL RELATIONS </p><p>WITH PRC AMBASSADOR YANG JIECHI </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: EAP A/S JAMES A. KELLY; REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (C) A/S KELLY BRIEFED AMBASSADOR YANG JIECHI JANUARY 9 ON </p><p>LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA, PREVIEWED </p><p>HIS UPCOMING TRIP TO THE REGION AND DISCUSSED OVERALL </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS.  ON KOREA, KELLY STRESSED U.S. TACTICAL </p><p>FLEXIBILITY IN FOCUSING ON OUR KEY OBJECTIVE, WHICH WAS TO </p><p>STOP THE DPRK NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  HE WELCOMED CONTINUING </p><p>COOPERATION ON CHINA\'S PART TOWARD THAT END AND PROMISED TO </p><p>BRIEF ON HIS SEOUL TALKS WHEN HE VISITS BEIJING NEXT WEEK. </p><p>ON BILATERAL ISSUES, AMB. YANG PRAISED THE TEMPO OF </p><p>U.S.-CHINA EXCHANGES IN THE COMING MONTHS WHILE REPEATING </p><p>FAMILIAR CONCERNS ABOUT TAIWAN.  YANG RAISED CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>FALUNGONG LEGAL ACTIONS AGAINST JIANG ZEMIN IN THE U.S. AND </p><p>WE RESPONDED WITH OUR OWN CONCERNS ABOUT HARSH JUDICIAL </p><p>TREATMENT OF FALUNGONG ADHERENTS IN CHINA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR YANG INVITED A/S KELLY TO BREAKFAST TO </p><p>DISCUSS KOREA AND BILATERAL ISSUES ON JANUARY 9. COUNSELORS </p><p>DENG HONGBO AND XIAO QIAN FROM THE CHINESE EMBASSY </p><p>PARTICIPATED, AS DID EAP/CM DIRECTOR YOUNG (NOTETAKER). </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>DISCUSSION OF KOREA </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) A/S KELLY BEGAN BY NOTING THE SECRETARY WAS PLEASED </p><p>WITH HIS PHONE CALL THE PREVIOUS EVENING TO FM TANG JIAXUAN. </p><p>THEY HAD A GOOD EXCHANGE ON KOREA AND BILATERAL RELATIONS. </p><p>THE TWO HAVE BUILT A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST AND RESPECT OVER </p><p>THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT HAS PROVEN MOST HELPFUL IN </p><p>RECENT MONTHS.  YANG WARMLY AGREED WITH THIS ASSESSMENT.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO YANG\'S QUERY, A/S KELLY MADE CLEAR WE ARE </p><p>PREPARED TO HAVE SOME INTERACTION WITH PYONGYANG IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH STEPS BY THE NORTH TO END THEIR ENRICHED </p><p>URANIUM PROGRAM AND BACK AWAY FROM REPROCESSING SPENT FUEL </p><p>FROM THE YONGBYON REACTOR, RATHER THAN INSISTING THAT ALL </p><p>THIS BE DONE BEFORE TALKS BEGIN.  THE KEY POINT WAS TO BRING </p><p>THE DPRK NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM TO AN END IN ALL ITS </p><p>ASPECTS.  NORTH KOREA WOULD WANT TO BRING OTHER ISSUES TO </p><p>THIS DIALOGUE, YANG OBSERVED.  AS TO THE NATURE OF ANY </p><p>POSSIBLE SECURITY ASSURANCES, A/S KELLY NOTED OUR CITATION IN </p><p>THE TCOG JOINT STATEMENT OF THE 1991 KOREAN BASIC AGREEMENT </p><p>AND THE DENUCLEARIZATION DECLARATION.  WE WERE PREPARED TO </p><p>DRAW FROM THIS AND OTHER FORMULATIONS IN CONSIDERING THE </p><p>NORTH\'S DESIRE FOR SECURITY ASSURANCES.  WE HAVE BEEN PLEASED </p><p>BY THE IAEA\'S ROLE IN ALL THIS.  IF WE EXPERIENCE PROGRESS ON </p><p>OUR CORE OBJECTIVES WITH THE NORTH, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO </p><p>RUSH THE IAEA DECISON-MAKING PROCESS TO THE POINT OF THEIR </p><p>TAKING THE ISSUE TO THE UNSC. </p><p></p><p>4.  (C) AMB. YANG ASKED IF THE U.S. HAD RECEIVED ANY REACTION </p><p>FROM THE NORTH TO ITS LATEST PROPOSAL ON CONTACTS.  A/S KELLY </p><p>INDICATED THAT A CRYPTIC BUT WORTHWHILE RESPONSE FROM THE </p><p>DPRK HAD BEEN RECEIVED.  YANG PRAISED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>STATEMENT CONCERNING NORTH KOREA.  PYONGYANG IS DEEPLY </p><p>ANXIOUS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY THREAT.  HE WAS </p><p>NOT PASSING JUDGMENT ON THIS, MERELY OBSERVING THE FACTS. </p><p>YANG ASKED IF THE U.S. MIGHT BE WILLING TO PROVIDE WRITTEN </p><p>SECURITY ASSURANCES TO THE NORTH AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT </p><p>PLEDGES TO DO WHAT WE WANT ON ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  A/S KELLY </p><p>INDICATED THAT WE REMAINED FLEXIBLE IN HOW WE GOT TO OUR </p><p>ULTIMATE GOAL OF A NONNUCLEAR KOREA.  THE SOUTH\'S PERSPECTIVE </p><p>WAS IMPORTANT HERE.  SEOUL DOES NOT WANT TO FACE A </p><p>NUCLEAR-ARMED NORTH, WHICH WOULD PUT IT AT A MAJOR MILITARY </p><p>DISADVANTAGE.  JAPAN AND COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST WERE </p><p>ALSO QUITE CONCERNED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR DPRK. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) YANG INQUIRED ABOUT ROK NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR </p><p>YIM\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON.  A/S KELLY INDICATED THAT YIM HAD </p><p>GOTTEN INTO MORE SPECIFICS THAN WERE COVERED BY DEPUTY FM LEE </p><p>DURING THE TCOG TALKS.  YIM WAS REFLECTING KIM DAE-JUNG\'S </p><p>DESIRE TO MANAGE THE REMAINING SEVEN WEEKS OF HIS </p><p>ADMINISTRATION EFFECTIVELY AS REGARDS THIS PROBLEM.  YIM HAD </p><p>SEEN SECRETARY OF DEFENSE RUMSFELD, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR </p><p>RICE AND OTHERS.  YANG ASKED ABOUT THE TIMING OF MR. KELLY\'S </p><p>TRIP TO SOUTH KOREA.  A/S KELLY CLARIFIED THAT THIS TRIP HAD </p><p>BEEN LONG PLANNED AS A CHANCE TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEXT </p><p>ADMINISTRATION\'S NEW TEAM, LED BY PRESIDENT-ELECT ROH </p><p>MOO-HYUN.  NATURALLY HE WILL DISCUSS LATEST DEVELOPMENTS WITH </p><p>OUR ALLIES IN SEOUL.  HE WOULD STAND READY TO BRIEF THE </p><p>CHINESE ABOUT HIS TALKS IN SOUTH KOREA WHEN HE TRAVELS ON TO </p><p>BEIJING NEXT WEDNESDAY.  MR. KELLY LOOKED FORWARD TO GOOD </p><p>EXCHANGES ON KOREA THERE.  HE WAS TRYING TO MEET PEOPLE FROM </p><p>THE PARTY\'S INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS FAMILIAR </p><p>INTERLOCUTERS IN THE MFA.  IN PARTICULAR HE INTENDED TO </p><p>STRESS THE SERIOUSNESS OF NORTH KOREA\'S THREAT TO REPROCESS </p><p>SPENT FUEL, WHICH COULD YIELD A GREAT DEAL OF WEAPONS-GRADE </p><p>MATERIAL IN A MATTER OF MONTHS.  AMB. YANG SAID HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT WELCOMED THIS OPPORTUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) YANG THEN TURNED THE DISCUSSION TO BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONS.  REHEARSING UPCOMING VISITS TO CHINA BY MR. KELLY, </p><p>U/S BOLTON AND POLICY PLANNER HAASS, YANG WELCOMED THIS TREND </p><p>TOWARD MORE EXCHANGES.  A/S KELLY RESPONDED THAT WE WERE </p><p>DOING OUR PART.  USTR\'S ZOELLICK WOULD BE GOING OUT IN </p><p>MID-FEBRUARY TO DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES.  THE VICE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>ADVANCE TEAM WAS ALSO GOING AFTER THE LUNAR NEW YEAR. </p><p>AMBASSADOR FRANK TAYLOR, NOW ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR </p><p>DIPLOMATIC SECURITY, WAS INTERESTED IN GOING TO BEIJING TO </p><p>CLEAR UP REMAINING ISSUES IN OUR PROPERTY NEGOTIATION (THE </p><p>COCA TALKS) AND MR. KELLY HOPED THE CHINESE SIDE WOULD </p><p>WELCOME THIS VISIT.  AMB. TAYLOR\'S REPLACEMENT AS </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM COORDINATOR, COFER BLACK, WAS ALSO </p><p>INTERESTED IN VISITING TO CONTINUE TALKS ON U.S.-CHINA </p><p>COOPERATION IN THIS AREA.  AMB. YANG PROMISED TO INFORM </p><p>BEIJING OF THESE LAST TWO VISITORS, ADDING THAT "WE SHOULD </p><p>BREAK THE DEADLOCK" ON OUR EMBASSY CONSTRUCTION NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) YANG INDICATED THAT BEIJING WOULD WELCOME A VISIT </p><p>NEXT MONTH BY THE SECRETARY.  A/S KELLY REITERATED THAT THE </p><p>SECRETARY WOULD LIKE TO COME, IF HE IS ABLE TO GET OUT OF </p><p>WASHINGTON TO ATTEND THE SOUTH KOREAN INAUGURATION IN LATE </p><p>FEBRUARY.  IF THE SECRETARY VISITED BEIJING, HE COULD SEE FM </p><p>TANG, VICE PREMIER QIAN AND OTHER CHINESE LEADERS AS </p><p>APPROPRIATE.  YANG ASSURED US THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK </p><p>HARD TO MAKE SUCH A VISIT A SUCCESS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (8) TURNING TO TAIWAN, YANG REITERATED FAMILIAR CHINESE </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE U.S.-TAIWAN BUSINESS COUNCIL MEETING </p><p>SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN SAN ANTONIO IN FEBRUARY.  BEIJING </p><p>WAS PARTICULARLY WORRIED THAT TAIWAN DEFENSE MINISTER TANG </p><p>YAO-MING MIGHT ATTEND, AS WELL AS SENIOR USG OFFICIALS. </p><p>CHINA WAS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN TAIWAN\'S HAN </p><p>KUANG EXERCISE.  PRESIDENT BUSH WAS OBLIGED TO RESPOND TO </p><p>CONGRESS ACCORDING TO LANGUAGE IN THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION </p><p>BILL ON THE FEASIBILITY OF VARIOUS DEFENSE PROGRAMS WITH </p><p>CHINA.  IF THESE ISSUES COULD BE SATISFACTORILY RESOLVED, </p><p>YANG CONCLUDED, WE COULD MOVE ON TO MORE PRODUCTIVE ISSUES. </p><p>A/S KELLY REPEATED THAT OUR POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN HAD NOT </p><p>CHANGED, AND THAT WE EMPHASIZED CONSISTENCY IN SUCH ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) YANG THEN RAISED THE FALUNGONG CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT </p><p>JIANG ZEMIN IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS DISTRICT COURT.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO THEIR INFORMATION, THERE WOULD BE A HEARING ON JANUARY 13. </p><p> THE PRC WAS STILL VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF </p><p>THIS CASE TO DAMAGE U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS, YANG INDICATED. </p><p>WHILE BEIJING APPRECIATED THE U.S. LEGAL SUBMISSION TO THE </p><p>COURT, IT HOPED WE COULD DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT THE CASE WAS </p><p>DISMISSED.  YOUNG USED THIS OCCASION TO RAISE PRESS REPORTS </p><p>THAT CHINA HAD RECENTLY SENTENCED FOUR FALUNGONG ADHERENTS IN </p><p>XINING, QINGHAI TO SENTENCES OF UP TO TWENTY YEARS FOR THEIR </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO INTERRUPT CHINESE TELEVISION BROADCASTS WITH </p><p>PRO-FALUNGONG TAPES.  WHILE THE U.S. ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH </p><p>ACTIVITIES ARE ILLEGAL, THE HARSH SENTENCES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY </p><p>TRIGGER PROTESTS HERE IN THE U.S. OVER THIS DRACONIAN </p><p>TREATMENT OF FALUNGONG IN CHINA.  A/S KELLY SECONDED THIS </p><p>CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) CONCLUDING THIS REVIEW OF BILATERAL RELATIONS, A/S </p><p>KELLY SAID HE LOOKED FORWARD TO A VIGOROUS SET OF EXCHANGES </p><p>IN THE COMING MONTHS.  A/S CRANER HAD BEEN PLEASED BY HIS </p><p>TALKS IN BEIJING AND XINJIANG.  THE GENEVA HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS COMING UP, BUT IT WAS STILL TOO EARLY TO </p><p>PREDICT HOW THAT WOULD TURN OUT.  YANG AGREED ON THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF MORE EXCHANGES, AND HOPED THAT </p><p>MILITARY-TO-MILITARY RELATIONS WOULD REFLECT THIS SPIRIT AS </p><p>WELL.  YOUNG INDICATED THAT OSD WAS WORKING ON THE CHINESE </p><p>PROPOSALS LAID OUT BY GENERAL XIONG GUANGKAI DURING LAST </p><p>MONTH\'S DEFENSE CONSULTATIVE TALKS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) RETURNING TO KOREA, AMB. YANG EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN </p><p>OVER ITEMS IN THE U.S. PRESS HE HAD SEEN THAT SUGGESTED CHINA </p><p>WAS "SITTING ON THE FENCE," NOT DOING ENOUGH TO COOPERATE ON </p><p>KOREA, OR HAD EVEN IN THE PAST ASSISTED PYONGYANG\'S NUCLEAR </p><p>PROGRAM.  HE ASSURED A/S KELLY THAT CHINA SHARED THE SAME </p><p>GOALS AS THE U.S.  WHILE NOTING THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME </p><p>REGRETTABLE PAST HISTORY INVOLVING CHINA, PAKISTAN AND NORTH </p><p>KOREA, A/S KELLY SAID THAT WAS NOW BEHIND US.  HE AGREED WITH </p><p>YANG\'S LAST COMMENT, ADDING THAT BOTH OF US WANT TO PREVENT </p><p>THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO NORTH KOREA. </p><p>SPEAKING FRANKLY, YANG CONCLUDED, SOME OF BEIJING\'S ACTIONS </p><p>DO NOT SIT WELL WITH ITS "CLOSE NEIGHBOR" (I.E. NORTH KOREA), </p><p>BUT THE FACT WAS THE PRC IS STILL COMMITTED TO MAKING THE </p><p>KOREAN PENINSULA NUCLEAR FREE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
