<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CARACAS 000811 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 3/16/09 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PBTS, PINS, PTER, CO, VE </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: COLOMBIA-VENEZUELA:  COOLER HEADS PREVAIL </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) BOGOTA 02179, (B) CARACAS 0778, (C) BOGOTA 2604 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN F. MAISTO.  REASON:  1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE DIPLOMATIC FLAP BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA </p><p>PROVOKED BY PRESIDENT CHAVEZ\'S MARCH 10 PRESS CONFERENCE COMMENT </p><p>IS OVER.  VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL AND HIS COLOMBIAN </p><p>COUNTERPART HAVE WORKED HARD TO RESOLVE THE INCIDENT AND TO FOCUS </p><p>AGAIN ON THE TASK AT HAND:  MANAGING A COMPLEX BILATERAL RELA- </p><p>TIONSHIP IN A WAY WHICH PROMOTES THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS AND </p><p>TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VALID VENEZUELAN BORDER SECURITY CONCERNS. </p><p>WHILE WORRISOME, THE INCIDENT DOES NOT PRESAGE AN INCREASE IN </p><p>TENSION BETWEEN BOTH COUNTRIES.  NEITHER SIDE IS LOOKING FOR A </p><p>FIGHT.  THE INCIDENT DOES, HOWEVER, SHOW THE FARC\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>MANIPULATE LINGERING DOUBTS AND HISTORIC ANIMOSITIES BETWEEN BOTH </p><p>COUNTRIES TO THE FARC\'S ADVANTAGE.  IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE </p><p>A SPECIAL ROLE TO PLAY TO HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE AND TO DEFINE </p><p>ROLES AS VENEZUELA SEEKS TO ENGAGE POSITIVELY IN THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>YESTERDAY\'S NEWS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) REFS A AND B INDICATE THAT THE DIPLOMATIC FLAP PROVOKED </p><p>BY PRESIDENT CHAVEZ\'S MARCH 10 PRESS CONFERENCE REMARKS IS OVER. </p><p>VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL, ON MARCH 11, DECLARED THE </p><p>INCIDENT "TRANSITORY AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL" AND "WELL ON ITS WAY TO </p><p>BEING RESOLVED."  ACCORDING TO REF A, COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>FERNANDEZ DE SOTO, ON MARCH 12, SAID THE "DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN </p><p>FULLY RESOLVED."  COLOMBIA\'S AMBASSADOR TO VENEZUELA </p><p>LUIS GUILLERMO GIRALDO, ON MARCH 15, TOLD AMBASSADOR, "THE </p><p>INCIDENT IS OVER." </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) HARD WORK BY RANGEL AND FERNANDEZ DE SOTO HAS PUT THIS </p><p>FLAP BEHIND BOTH COUNTRIES, AND FOCUSED ATTENTION WHERE IT SHOULD </p><p>BE:  MANAGING A COMPLEX BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP IN A WAY WHICH </p><p>PROMOTES THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT </p><p>VALID VENEZUELAN BORDER SECURITY CONCERNS.  THE NEXT STEP IN THIS </p><p>PROCESS, ACCORDING TO RANGEL, WILL BE A MEETING, AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE, OF FOREIGN MINISTERS.  THIS MEETING WILL SET THE STAGE </p><p>FOR A MEETING BETWEEN CHAVEZ AND PASTRANA.  FROM OUR CONVERSA- </p><p>TIONS WITH RANGEL AND GIRALDO, BOTH SIDES RECOGNIZE THAT THIS </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL MEETING MUST BE VERY CAREFULLY HANDLED.  GIRALDO </p><p>TOLD US THAT THE COMMUNIQUE AND PRESS CONFERENCES WHICH WOULD </p><p>RESULT FROM SUCH A MEETING WOULD REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION, AS </p><p>THE MEDIA WILL BE PROBING FOR ANY SIGN OF DISAGREEMENT OR DIS- </p><p>PUTE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WHAT THE FLAP DOES NOT MEAN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AS THE COLOMBIANS AND THE VENEZUELANS PUT THIS ASPECT OF </p><p>THEIR RELATIONSHIP BACK ON TRACK, IT IS WORTHWHILE LOOKING AT </p><p>WHAT THE FLAP DOES NOT MEAN AND, THEN, AT WHAT IT DOES MEAN. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, THE FLAP DOES NOT MEAN: </p><p> </p><p>--  AN INCREASE IN OVERALL TENSION IN THE RELATIONSHIP.  THE </p><p>VENEZUELA-COLOMBIA RELATIONSHIP IS SOLIDLY FIXED IN A TIGHTLY </p><p>WOVEN LATTICE OF COMMERCIAL, CULTURAL, ECOLOGICAL, AND MIGRATION </p><p>PATTERNS AND RELATIONSHIPS.  THIS FOUNDATION HAS WEATHERED FAR </p><p>WORSE TEMPESTS THAN THE RECENT FLAP. </p><p> </p><p>--  A HEIGHTENED POTENTIAL FOR BORDER INCIDENTS, ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>REGARD TO MARITIME BOUNDARIES.  NEITHER COUNTRY IS LOOKING FOR A </p><p>FIGHT.  BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE BUILT AN IMPRESSIVE POLITICAL BUFFER </p><p>OF BINATIONAL COMMISSIONS AND STUDY GROUPS TO ADDRESS ALL THESE </p><p>ISSUES, AND TO MANAGE THEM IN A LOW KEY AND REGULAR FASHION. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, AT AN OPERATIONAL LEVEL, THE MILITARIES OF BOTH </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIPS ALONG THE FRONTIER, AS </p><p>GENERAL WILHELM SAW DURING HIS VISIT LAST OCTOBER.  MOREOVER, WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT VENEZUELAN MILITARY LEADERSHIP HAS </p><p>OPTIMAL RELATIONS WITH THEIR COLOMBIAN COUNTERPARTS.  REGULAR </p><p>REPORTING ON INFORMAL INTELLIGENCE-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN </p><p>BORDER UNITS, VENEZUELAN EXTRACTION AND INSERTION ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>COLOMBIAN UNITS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROCEDURES TO MANAGE </p><p>CROSS-BORDER PURSUIT AND OTHER INCIDENTS FAR OUTWEIGH PRESS </p><p>REPORTS OF ONE ARMY OR THE OTHER DEFILING THE TERRITORY OF THE </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>WHAT IT DOES MEAN </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHAT THE FLAP DOES MEAN: </p><p> </p><p>--  CHAVEZ TALKS TOO MUCH.  AS WE NOTED IN REF B, CHAVEZ NEEDS TO </p><p>CULTIVATE SOME DISCRETION WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE COLOMBIAN PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL, DEFENSE MINISTER, AND OTHERS </p><p>AROUND CHAVEZ RECOGNIZE THIS.  THEY HAVE TOLD HIM TO MEASURE HIS </p><p>WORDS.  THAT SAID, CHAVEZ IS TALKING TO THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE </p><p>ABOUT THE CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA, AND ITS IMPACT ON VENEZUELA, IN </p><p>AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WAY.  NO PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAS DONE </p><p>THIS.  THE CALDERA GOVERNMENT MANAGED A TWO-TRACK POLICY OF </p><p>PUBLICLY DEALING WITH THE GOC WHILE SECRETLY TREATING WITH THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS.  CHAVEZ HAS BROUGHT THIS RELATIONSHIP OUT INTO THE </p><p>OPEN, AND, IN THE PROCESS, TRIED TO ESTABLISH SOME ACCOUNTABILITY </p><p>ON THE PART OF THE GUERRILLAS FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN VENEZUELAN </p><p>TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>--  VENEZUELA IS ASSERTING ITS INTEREST IN THE COLOMBIAN PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  WHETHER RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, VENEZUELANS PERCEIVE THAT </p><p>THE GOC IS NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE </p><p>VENEZUELAN SIDE OF THE FRONTIER.  VENEZUELANS TELL ALL WHO WILL </p><p>LISTEN THAT THEIRS IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE REGION WHICH WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO SEE LARGE CONCENTRATIONS OF NEIGHBORING TROOPS ON THE </p><p>BORDER.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE GOC IS HARD-PRESSED JUST TO </p><p>MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF MAJOR CITIES AND ECONOMIC CENTERS, THE </p><p>GOV RESENTS THAT BORDER SECURITY HAS DEVOLVED ALMOST SOLELY TO </p><p>THE VENEZUELAN ARMED FORCES.  IN THIS REGARD, THE COLOMBIAN PEACE </p><p>PROCESS IS NOT SIMPLY AN INTERNAL AFFAIR OF COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE GOV </p><p>ANTICIPATED.  WHILE THE GOV HAS HAD A RING-SIDE SEAT SINCE THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE INSURGENCY, AND HAS WATCHED WITH FASCINATED </p><p>HORROR WHILE COLOMBIANS SLAUGHTERED EACH OTHER, IT ENTERED THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS AS AN INGENUE.  CHAVEZ THOUGHT HIS PERSONAL RELA- </p><p>TIONSHIP WITH PASTRANA WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SECURE THE TRUST OF THE </p><p>GOC, AND THAT HIS BOLIVARIAN RHETORIC AND THE CONNECTION OF SOME </p><p>OF HIS POLITICAL ALLIES TO THE GUERRILLAS WOULD BE ENOUGH TO WIN </p><p>THEIR COLLABORATION.  HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT BOTH SIDES OF </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN CONFLICT WOULD VIEW WITH SUSPICION AND DISTRUST HIS </p><p>BARGING INTO THE PEACE PROCESS.  HE ALSO DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT </p><p>ELEMENTS OF BOTH SIDES WOULD LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO EXCLUDE </p><p>HIM FROM THE PROCESS.  FOLLOWING THE EVENTS OF THE PAST TWO </p><p>WEEKS--SPECIFICALLY, THE KILLING OF THE THREE U.S. CITIZENS AND </p><p>THE PASTRANA MEETING POSTPONEMENT--CHAVEZ AND HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON.  AS RANGEL TOLD US (REF B), THEY ARE </p><p>NOW REFLECTING ON THEIR ROLE IN THAT PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE GUERRILLAS ARE CAPABLE OF MANIPULATING LINGERING SUSPI- </p><p>CIONS AND HISTORIC ANIMOSITIES BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA. </p><p>THE FARC AND THE ELN ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO BENEFIT FROM THE </p><p>RECENT FLAP.  BY TRYING TO PLAY ONE COUNTRY OFF AGAINST THE </p><p>OTHER, THEY SEEK TO CREATE DIVISIONS AMONG THE PROTAGONISTS OF </p><p>PEACE.  AS RANGEL TOLD US, THE GOV VIEWS THE RECENT GUT-WRENCHING </p><p>BRUTALITY OF THE EXECUTION OF THE THREE U.S. CITIZENS AS JUST </p><p>SUCH A PROVOCATION, DESIGNED TO CAUSE PROBLEMS AND DOUBTS AMONG </p><p>VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA, AND THE THIRD PLAYER IN THE PEACE PRO- </p><p>CESS:  THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>WHAT WE MUST DO </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE VENEZUELANS HAVE REACHED OUT TO US AND REQUESTED OUR </p><p>HELP IN EVALUATING RECENT EVENTS AND IN DEFINING THEIR ROLE IN </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS.  WE SHOULD RESPOND QUICKLY AND POSITIVELY TO </p><p>THIS REQUEST.  AS AMEMBASSY BOGOTA NOTES IN REF A, COOLER HEADS </p><p>HAVE PREVAILED IN THIS MOST RECENT INCIDENT.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT </p><p>THE ANTAGONISTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE THE FARC AND THE ELN, WE CAN </p><p>EXPECT MORE PROVOCATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
