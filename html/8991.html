Summary.  A spurt of promotions will see the Party Secretaries </p><p>from both Danang City and Lam Dong Province move to high-ranking </p><p>positions in the Communist Party in Hanoi.  The Danang City Deputy </p><p>Party Secretary will then become the Party Secretary there, while </p><p>a Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development from Hanoi </p><p>will become Party Secretary for Lam Dong Province.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>DANANG CITY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  In the Party Congress in Danang City on June 23, 2003, Mr. </p><p>Nguyen Ba Thanh, Deputy Party Secretary and Chairman of Danang </p><p>City People\'s Committee, was unanimously elected to be Party </p><p>Secretary of the Danang Party Committee.  He will continue to hold </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>his current position until the next meeting of the Danang City </p><p>People\'s Council, probably at the end of July.  At that meeting he </p><p>will present his resignation as head of the People\'s Committee and </p><p>the Council will vote on his successor.  Mr. Thanh moves up to </p><p>succeed Mr. Nguyen Duc Hat, who will go to Hanoi to take the post </p><p>of Deputy Head of the Central Commission on Organizational Affairs </p><p>for the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV).  Both appointments have </p><p>been arranged by the CPV but will not be final until confirmed by </p><p>the Politburo, which will issue a formal decision. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>LAM DONG PROVINCE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The CPV also announced in "Saigon Giai Phong" newspaper on </p><p>June 25, that Mr. Nguyen Van Dang, the First Deputy Minister of </p><p>Agriculture and Rural Development and a member of the Executive </p><p>Party Committee in Hanoi, will assume the position of the Party </p><p>Secretary of Lam Dong Province.  Mr. Dang will replace Mr. Nguyen </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Hoai Bao, who is leaving his positions as Party Secretary of Lam </p><p>Dong Province and Chairman of the Lam Dong Province People\'s </p><p>Council to go to Hanoi and take the post of Deputy Head of the </p><p>Central Commission on Mass Mobilization in charge of the South. </p><p>The Politburo has not yet issued formal decisions on these </p><p>appointments either, but they are considered pro forma. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The CPV regularly rotates its high-level officials among the </p><p>different regions of Vietnam, and the promotion of Mr. Hat and Mr. </p><p>Bao to high-level CPV positions speaks well of their performance </p><p>in Danang and Lam Dong.  Danang City ranks fourth after Ho Chi </p><p>Minh City, Hanoi and Hai Phong for per capita income in Vietnam. </p><p>It is the commercial hub for the provinces in the middle region of </p><p>Vietnam, and has been modernizing and growing rapidly over the </p><p>past three years.  Mr. Thanh\'s promotion to Party Secretary sends </p><p>a positive message for growth in the city.  In his current deputy </p><p>role, he has worked with the people of Danang to successfully </p><p>carry out controversial the land reclamation and resettlement </p><p>projects that were the necessary precursors to modernizing the </p><p>city\'s infrastructure.  When the central government balked at the </p><p>idea of funding a new bridge in Danang, he raised most of the </p><p>funds by mobilizing local resources -- and the GVN later offered </p><p>to fund the rest.  Mr. Thanh has organized press conferences to </p><p>discuss problems in the city.  In response to public concerns, he </p><p>set up a civil security corps to regulate traffic flows and crack </p><p>down on street crime. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The southernmost of the "Central Highland" provinces, Lam Dong </p><p>is famous for its agriculture, but has suffered from the drop in </p><p>coffee and other commodity prices.  The appointment of Mr. Dang to </p><p>the position of Party Secretary -- with his experience as the </p><p>First Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development -- may </p><p>mean the CPV wants to focus on those areas.  As Provincial Party </p><p>Secretary, Mr. Dang will have to balance the picturesque tourist </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>center of Dalat against the periphery of Lam Dong\'s rural poor, in </p><p>order to bring greater development to the province as a whole.  He </p><p>will also have to address the same volatile mix of ethnic </p><p>minorities, land disputes and outlawed religious groups that exist </p><p>in the three neighboring Central Highlands provinces of Dak Lak, </p><p>Gia Lai, and Kon Tum.  Lam Dong Province also gets more than its </p><p>share of attention when it comes to tourism development, because </p><p>its capital city, Dalat, is a very popular destination for both </p><p>Vietnamese and foreigners.  However, Lam Dong provincial </p><p>authorities do not enjoy a good reputation when it comes to </p><p>creating a hospitable climate for foreign investment.  A </p><p>Singaporean firm recently pulled out of a joint venture, and an </p><p>American corporate businessman has also experienced problems </p><p>there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
