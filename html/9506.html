<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 THE HAGUE 001837 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KAWC, KJUS, ICTY, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: ICC: PROSECUTOR FOCUSES ON CONGO, DISCLAIMS ANY </p><p>ABILITY TO EXAMINE U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: THE HAGUE 01806 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive But Unclassified; Protect Accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: On July 16, the Chief Prosecutor of the </p><p>International Criminal Court (ICC), Luis Moreno-Ocampo, held </p><p>a press conference in The Hague to discuss information his </p><p>office has received from around the world about possible </p><p>areas for ICC inquiry.  During the ICC\'s first year, the </p><p>Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) received 499 communications </p><p>from individuals and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in </p><p>66 different countries.  The largest number of communications </p><p>came from Germany (93), the United States (70), France (58), </p><p>the United Kingdom (33), the Netherlands (29) and Spain (23). </p><p> As expected (see reftel), Ocampo is focusing his </p><p>investigative energies on the Congo and ruling out an </p><p>examination of the situation in Iraq with respect to U.S. </p><p>forces.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In his first press conference, ICC Chief Prosecutor </p><p>Ocampo reviewed the jurisdiction of the ICC, summarized </p><p>incoming communications from individuals and NGOs and </p><p>explained his interest in the Congo.  Details on these topics </p><p>may be found in the ICC press release reproduced at para 6. </p><p>His office has identified the situation in Ituri, Democratic </p><p>Republic of Congo (DRC), as the most urgent situation to be </p><p>examined at this time.  If he uncovers sufficient reason to </p><p>do so as a result of his preliminary examination, the OTP </p><p>will seek authorization from a Pre-Trial Chamber of the Court </p><p>to initiate an investigation.  Ocampo stated that the primary </p><p>focus will be to determine the ability or willingness of the </p><p>transitional government in DRC to investigate and prosecute </p><p>the alleged crimes. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Ocampo fielded several questions from the press.  He </p><p>noted that the Court has received several communications </p><p>regarding the war in Iraq which generally lack detail. </p><p>Ocampo said that since neither Iraq nor the United States is </p><p>a State Party to the Convention, the ICC has no jurisdiction </p><p>over such matters.  (For the same reason, he said that two </p><p>communications regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict </p><p>would not be examined by his office.)  He advised that </p><p>individuals with specific information should address their </p><p>concerns directly to the USG.  With respect to allegations </p><p>concerning British forces in Iraq, Ocampo said that OTP would </p><p>only examine them if the UK were "unable or unwilling" to </p><p>investigate (a point referenced in the press release at para </p><p>6).  Several questions alluded to the USG\'s status as a </p><p>non-party and its efforts to negotiate Article 98 agreements. </p><p> When one reporter asked if Washington\'s "aggressive </p><p>campaign" was affecting the ICC\'s work, he responded, "I do </p><p>not know . . . we will see."  When pressed further, he said </p><p>that it was not his job to worry about U.S. policy and that </p><p>it was his personal feeling that in the future, all </p><p>countries, including the United States, will join the ICC. </p><p>Ocampo implied an interest in working with non-parties such </p><p>as the United States when discussing OTP\'s need for solid </p><p>information on Congo; he said that there is open-source </p><p>information available, such as the Department\'s Human Rights </p><p>Report, but that he hoped governments would provide access to </p><p>closed-source information as well. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In addition to reporting on developments in OTP, </p><p>Ocampo affirmed that he is also concentrating on building up </p><p>the staff of his organization with a focus on investigators. </p><p>By the end of 2003, he said, he expects to have 51 staffers </p><p>working primarily on investigations.  By the end of 2004, he </p><p>hopes to have 122 staffers divided into three teams. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment:  While the announcement of OTP interest in </p><p>the Congo was not surprising, it is a somewhat risky gambit </p><p>given OTP\'s limited resources and the fact that it will be </p><p>some months, at the earliest, before Ocampo is in a position </p><p>to conduct a full-fledged investigation into Ituri, let alone </p><p>initiate a prosecution.  His failure to mention other </p><p>situations rumored to be among his interests, such as </p><p>Colombia, may reflect his recognition that limited resources </p><p>will enable him to focus only on the Congo over the coming </p><p>months.  More unexpected than what he expects to investigate </p><p>was his signal to individuals and NGOs that he would hope </p><p>that they only bring to his attention matters arguably within </p><p>his mandate.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Begin text of ICC Press Release: </p><p> </p><p>16 July 2003 </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED </p><p>BY THE OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE ICC </p><p>Since July 2002, the Office of the Prosecutor has received </p><p>499 communications from 66 different countries. These </p><p>communications address a broad range of crimes allegedly </p><p>committed in a number of regions around the world. Almost all </p><p>of these communications request the Office of the Prosecutor </p><p>to undertake legal action. </p><p> </p><p>Some of the complaints received cannot be investigated by </p><p>this Office because they are outside the jurisdiction of the </p><p>International Criminal Court. The provisions establishing the </p><p>jurisdiction of the Court were negotiated between more than </p><p>150 countries over a period of more than four years. In </p><p>accordance with those provisions, the Court may exercise </p><p>jurisdiction if genocide, crimes against humanity or war </p><p>crimes are committed on or after 1 July 2002. The </p><p>jurisdiction of the Court may be triggered by a referral from </p><p>the United Nations Security Council, a State Party or the </p><p>Prosecutor exercising his proprio motu powers to initiate an </p><p>investigation. To this date, there have not been any </p><p>referrals by the Security Council or by a State. </p><p> </p><p>In order to launch an investigation proprio motu, the </p><p>Prosecutor must seek the authorization of a Pre-Trial Chamber </p><p>of the Court. In this case, the alleged crimes must have been </p><p>committed by nationals of a State Party or have taken place </p><p>in the territory of a State Party. </p><p> </p><p>I.    Allegations of crimes that are not within the </p><p>jurisdiction of the ICC </p><p> </p><p>Temporal jurisdiction </p><p>The Office has received over 50 communications containing </p><p>allegations of acts committed before 1 July 2002, so they are </p><p>not within the temporal jurisdiction of the Court. </p><p> </p><p>Subject-matter jurisdiction </p><p>A number of communications allege criminal acts which by </p><p>their nature lie outside the subject-matter jurisdiction of </p><p>the Court. Some letters and complaints, for example, allege </p><p>criminal acts related to environmental damage, drug </p><p>trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, and judicial </p><p>corruption. Other communications call upon the Court to </p><p>become a court of appeals for decisions taken by domestic </p><p>courts or they concern human rights violations outside the </p><p>scope of the Statute. </p><p> </p><p>Under the Rome Statute, these allegations do not fall within </p><p>the jurisdiction of the Court. The Court is not designed to </p><p>deal with violations of human rights unless they constitute </p><p>genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. </p><p> </p><p>The crime of aggression </p><p>Thirty-eight communications express the view that a crime of </p><p>aggression took place in the context of the war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>The Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over alleged crimes of </p><p>aggression until the crime is defined and the conditions for </p><p>the exercise of jurisdiction are set out. The Assembly of </p><p>States Parties of the International Criminal Court may adopt </p><p>such a provision at a review conference to be convened in </p><p>2009. Thus, the alleged crime to which these communications </p><p>refer does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Court. </p><p> </p><p>Crimes committed in the territory of non-States Parties </p><p>Sixteen communications with no detailed information relate to </p><p>acts allegedly committed by United States, troops on the </p><p>territory of Iraq. Since neither Iraq nor the United States </p><p>is a State Party to the Statute, the ICC has no jurisdiction </p><p>in these matters. </p><p> </p><p>There are two brief communications with no detailed </p><p>information about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These </p><p>communications do not involve any State Party. The alleged </p><p>crimes, therefore, do not fall within the jurisdiction of the </p><p>Court. </p><p> </p><p>The Office has received communications alleging the killing </p><p>of civilians by army soldiers in the Ivory Coast. The media </p><p>has reported that the Ivory Coast has asked the UN Security </p><p>Council to refer the situation in the country to the </p><p>Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in accordance </p><p>with Article 13(b) of the Rome Statute, but the Office of the </p><p>Prosecutor has received no information from the State or the </p><p>Security Council. Thus, at this time, the Prosecutor of the </p><p>Court cannot investigate the crimes allegedly committed </p><p>because Ivory Coast is not a State Party to the Rome Statute. </p><p> </p><p>II.   Crimes allegedly committed by nationals of a State </p><p>Party or in the territory of a State Party </p><p> </p><p>The Office of the Prosecutor has received some communications </p><p>referring to crimes allegedly committed by nationals of a </p><p>State Party.  For example, some communications refer to acts </p><p>allegedly committed by States Parties who were part of the </p><p>coalition forces during the war in Iraq. Pursuant to the Rome </p><p>Statute, the jurisdiction of the ICC is complementary to that </p><p>of national criminal jurisdictions. Thus, in order for the </p><p>Court to exercise jurisdiction over these alleged crimes, it </p><p>is necessary to determine whether the national authorities </p><p>concerned are unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute. </p><p> </p><p>The Office of the Prosecutor expects that future </p><p>communications alleging the commission of crimes falling </p><p>within the jurisdiction of the Court contain specific </p><p>information concerning the ability or willingness of national </p><p>authorities to deal with those crimes, as well as a </p><p>description of the efforts undertaken, if any, to seek </p><p>redress before those authorities where appropriate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>III.  Decision by the Office of the Prosecutor to closely </p><p>follow the situation in Ituri, Democratic Republic of Congo </p><p> </p><p>The Office of the Prosecutor has selected the situation in </p><p>Ituri, Democratic Republic of Congo, as the most urgent </p><p>situation to be followed. The Prosecutor himself and selected </p><p>staff are analyzing the information available and will </p><p>request additional information on the occurrence of crimes </p><p>and assess the ability of the State to deal with them. The </p><p>Office is conscious of the peace process under way, and hopes </p><p>that the efforts of the international community to halt the </p><p>violence will bear fruit. The Office of the Prosecutor will </p><p>use all the powers at its disposal to contribute to the </p><p>prevention of future crimes and the investigation and </p><p>punishment of the alleged crimes committed in Ituri. If </p><p>necessary, the Office of the Prosecutor will seek </p><p>authorization from a Pre-Trial Chamber to start an </p><p>investigation. </p><p> </p><p>a. Crimes allegedly committed in the Democratic Republic of </p><p>Congo </p><p> </p><p>The Office of the Prosecutor has received six communications </p><p>regarding the situation in Ituri, including two detailed </p><p>reports from non-governmental organizations. These reports </p><p>estimate that 5,000 civilians have been killed in Ituri </p><p>between July 2002 and early 2003. These deaths are just a </p><p>fraction of the civilians who reportedly have died since the </p><p>conflict started in 1998.  The estimated total number of </p><p>deaths varies in different reports, ranging between 2.5 and </p><p>3.3 million people. The deaths are a consequence of the </p><p>fighting as well as of indirect causes including starvation, </p><p>landmines, untreated injuries and diseases (including the </p><p>transmission of HIV/AIDS through rape). </p><p> </p><p>The fighting taking place in Ituri seems to be the outcome of </p><p>ethnic strife and of the struggle for local power, </p><p>intertwined with national and regional conflicts. All of </p><p>these aspects of the situation are fueled by the way natural </p><p>resources are exploited. </p><p> </p><p>Specifically, the reports allege that armed assailants in </p><p>Ituri massacred unarmed civilians, some solely on the basis </p><p>of their ethnicity, killing scores of people in individual </p><p>attacks over the past year. Members of different armed </p><p>groups, reportedly vying for control over the region,s </p><p>natural resources, have also allegedly carried out summary </p><p>executions, systematic torture, unlawful arrests and </p><p>detention of individuals, and abductions of persons whose </p><p>whereabouts remain unknown. Crimes specifically targeting </p><p>women have also been reported as taking place frequently in </p><p>Ituri, including rape and other forms of sexual violence. </p><p> </p><p>This information is corroborated by different United Nations, </p><p>national human rights, media and non-governmental </p><p>organizations reports. The report on the latest of four </p><p>Security Council missions to the Democratic Republic of </p><p>Congo, issued on 16 June 2003, described the occurrence of </p><p>gross violations of human rights in the eastern part of the </p><p>country, including murder, mass rape, large-scale </p><p>displacement of civilians, the use of child soldiers and </p><p>even, reportedly, cases of ritual cannibalism. </p><p> </p><p>These crimes could constitute genocide, crimes against </p><p>humanity or war crimes, and could thus, fall within the </p><p>jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. </p><p> </p><p>b. Money-laundering and other crimes committed outside the </p><p>Democratic Republic of Congo which may be connected with the </p><p>atrocities </p><p> </p><p>Various reports have pointed to links between the activities </p><p>of some African, European and Middle Eastern companies and </p><p>the atrocities taking place in the Democratic Republic of </p><p>Congo. The alleged involvement of organized crime groups from </p><p>Eastern Europe has also been mentioned. Their activities </p><p>allegedly include gold mining, the illegal exploitation of </p><p>oil, and the arms trade. There is general concern that the </p><p>atrocities allegedly committed in the country may be fueled </p><p>by the exploitation of natural resources there and the arms </p><p>trade, which are enabled through the international banking </p><p>system. </p><p> </p><p>Although the specific findings of these reports have not been </p><p>confirmed, the Prosecutor believes that investigation of the </p><p>financial aspects of the alleged atrocities will be crucial </p><p>to prevent future crimes and for the prosecution of crimes </p><p>already committed. If the alleged business practices continue </p><p>to fuel atrocities, these would not be stopped even if </p><p>current perpetrators were arrested and prosecuted. The Office </p><p>of the Prosecutor is establishing whether investigations and </p><p>prosecutions on the financial side of the alleged atrocities </p><p>are being carried out in the relevant countries. </p><p> </p><p>c. Ability of the government of the Democratic Republic of </p><p>Congo to genuinely investigate and prosecute the crimes </p><p>allegedly committed in Ituri </p><p> </p><p>A transitional government was being established in the </p><p>Democratic Republic of Congo on 30 June 2003. This government </p><p>stated that it intends to put an end to the bloodshed, but in </p><p>order to do this it requires the resolved assistance of the </p><p>international community. </p><p> </p><p>The United Nations Security Council is following the </p><p>situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo closely. It has </p><p>sent four missions to the country, the last on 7-16 June </p><p>2003. According to the report of this last mission fighting </p><p>continues to affect the area, and impunity remains rampant in </p><p>Ituri. </p><p> </p><p>In their last meeting on 7 July 2003, members of the Security </p><p>Council again expressed their concern about the situation in </p><p>the country. In this meeting the Council received information </p><p>from Jean-Marie Guhenno, Under-Secretary-General for </p><p>Peacekeeping Operations, and from Bertrand G. Ramcharan, </p><p>acting High Commissioner for Human Rights.  There was a </p><p>general recognition that the transitional government faces </p><p>many difficulties, but also that peace cannot be restored </p><p>without an end to impunity. Several possibilities and </p><p>complementary mechanisms -- including national truth </p><p>commissions and a human rights observatory agreed upon during </p><p>the Inter-Congolese Dialogue at Sun City (South Africa) -- </p><p>have been identified. The members of the Security Council </p><p>have also acknowledged the need for international assistance </p><p>to effectively investigate the alleged crimes and punish the </p><p>perpetrators. </p><p> </p><p>The United States Department of State,s 2002 country report </p><p>on the Democratic Republic of Congo confirms the difficulties </p><p>of the national government to control the territory. It also </p><p>described the inability of judicial and police authorities to </p><p>investigate and prosecute the alleged crimes. </p><p> </p><p>The Office of the Prosecutor on the International Criminal </p><p>Court supports the efforts being made by national and </p><p>international actors alike to help the country along the road </p><p>to peace, and will bear these efforts in mind as it continues </p><p>to follow the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo </p><p>closely. </p><p> </p><p>End text of ICC press release. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
