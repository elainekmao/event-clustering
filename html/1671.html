<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000964 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/03/2011 </p><p>TAGS: OVIP, SNAR, CJAN, MASS, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NSA MOHAMMED AND AMBASSADOR DISCUSS PRESIDENT </p><p>OBASANJO\'S VISIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F.Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Jeter called on NSA Mohammed on </p><p>May 3 to discuss President Obasanjo\'s visit to Washington. </p><p>Police reform, some sub-regional issues, and Nigeria\'s voting </p><p>record in the Commission on Human Rights (covered septel) </p><p>were also discussed.  The NSA expressed interest in an </p><p>OFR-type program for the police, and suggested the Lagos </p><p>Command as a possible starting-point.  The NSA agreed with </p><p>Washington notional plans for the visit.  He said that both </p><p>he and the President would meet with Alhaji Kromah later on </p><p>May 3.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The Ambassador was accompanied by RNLEO, A/DCM, and </p><p>his Staff Assistant (notetaker).  The NSA was joined by State </p><p>House Chief of Protocol Ambassador J.O. Coker, and the </p><p>Minister of State for the Army Alhaji Lawal Batagarawa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============= </p><p>POLICE REFORM </p><p>============= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The Ambassador noted that the round-table planned for </p><p>May 9 in Washington would focus on law enforcement issues, </p><p>and called on RNLEO to update the NSA on the work of the </p><p>police reform team presently in Nigeria.  RNLEO stated that </p><p>the work of the team was a continuation of the work begun by </p><p>OTI last year, which had included discussions and planning </p><p>with the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Minister </p><p>of Police Affairs.  During the past week, the team had </p><p>visited Lagos, Abuja, Jos, Maidugari, and Port Harcourt. </p><p>They would meet shortly with the IGP and Police Minister as </p><p>well.  RNLEO explained that while everyone understood the </p><p>need for more police in Nigeria, the large number of new </p><p>recruits were straining resources at training institutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The NSA stated that in May 1999, there were only </p><p>125,000 police in Nigeria.  The Obasanjo Administration had </p><p>decided that at least 280,000 were needed, and had decided to </p><p>meet that requirement over a four year period. </p><p>Unfortunately, the NSA admitted, the Administration had not </p><p>realized how far the military regime had gutted the training </p><p>istitutions, and he noted that in addition to lack of </p><p>facilities, there was even a lack of trained instructors. </p><p>The NSA remarked that during a past visit to Washington, he </p><p>had met with AG Reno and FBI Director Freeh, and that they </p><p>had pledged cooperation and support for police reform. </p><p>(Mohammed emphasized fighting financial crimes and building a </p><p>criminal database.)  He also said that Nigeria would welcome </p><p>a train and equip program, like that of OFR, for the police. </p><p>(COMMENT:  The NSA stated that he had discussed OFR with </p><p>soon-to-retire General Archibong.  Archibong had told the NSA </p><p>that OFR "was the best thing ever to happen to Nigerian </p><p>soldiers."  END COMMENT.)  He noted that Lagos State Governor </p><p>Tinubu was coming to the Villa for a meeting with the </p><p>President and the IGP that afternoon to discuss security </p><p>concerns in Lagos, and emphasized that the Lagos police </p><p>command could be used as a test for such a program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  RNLEO noted that FBI training in forensics and </p><p>establishment of a criminal database had already been </p><p>approved and would soon be implemented.  The Ambassador added </p><p>that the round-table in Washington would afford Mohammed the </p><p>opportunity to raise ideas, and to discuss GON plans, </p><p>commitments, and concerns.  However, the Ambassador noted, </p><p>the concern is that the police are taken care of, that they </p><p>recieve their pay, and that new recruits receive adequate </p><p>training they need to be effective and to protect the </p><p>comunities in which they work.  Ambassador Jeter also </p><p>affirmed that law enforcement reform was critical to the </p><p>consolidation of democracy.  The NSA said that a census had </p><p>been taken of the civil and police services to determine the </p><p>real number of state employees (vice "ghost" employees), and </p><p>that this had caused a delay in payment of salaries, but that </p><p>the salary distribution system would be improved in the next </p><p>two or three months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========= </p><p>THE VISIT </p><p>========= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The NSA said that Obasanjo was meeting with Al-Mahdi </p><p>later the same day.  He would go to Rwanda on Monday, and </p><p>then on to the Congo.  The purpose was to collect ideas and </p><p>bring them to Washington as issues relating to the sub-region </p><p>and the continent.  Ambassador Jeter firmly suggested that </p><p>the President not diffuse the meeting with President Bush </p><p>with too many issues.  The NSA replied that Obasanjo would </p><p>raise briefly only four issues outside of those relating to </p><p>Nigeria: Sudan, the Congo, Libya, and West Africa (which </p><p>would be more extensive).  The Ambassador emphasized that too </p><p>much focus on the continent would take away focus from </p><p>Nigerian issues, which were the main purpose of the meetings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador Jeter then explained that the number of </p><p>accompanying officials should be kept small to keep the visit </p><p>manageable and focused.  He noted that this was the first </p><p>visit to Washington by an African Head of State, and that </p><p>numerous side meetings had been planned with Wahington </p><p>Cabinet Secretaries.  Moreover, this would be the longest </p><p>visit of a Head of State thus far in this Administration. </p><p>The Ambassador then delineated the proposed meetings.  He </p><p>also noted that the round-table on law enorcement issues </p><p>would likely cover police reform, counter-narcotics, and </p><p>anti-financial crimes efforts, and the White House, State, </p><p>DEA, USSS, and the FBI would probably all participate. </p><p>Finally, there would be a discussion relating to reforming </p><p>the JEPC process.  The NSA seemed pleased, and said that </p><p>these were all of the issues that had been discussed with </p><p>Ambassador Aminu.  Mohammed confirmed that AG Bola Ige, the </p><p>President\'s Senior Advisor on Drugs and Financial Crimes, </p><p>Ibrahim Lame and NDLEA Chairman Lafiaji would travel to </p><p>Washington for the visit.  Also, Peter Yisa Gana, the </p><p>Chairman of the Special Investigations Panel and Assistant </p><p>Commissioner of Police, would accompany the group as a police </p><p>advisor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The Ambassador then asked if there was an issue </p><p>relating to deportations that would be raised.  The NSA </p><p>explained that the GON desired that the USG provide warning </p><p>when deportation flights were coming, so the deportees could </p><p>be properly handled.  RNLEO asked if there was one agency who </p><p>was in charge in these cases -- there had been some confusion </p><p>among competing agencies in the past.  Mohammed said that he </p><p>had charged a commission to investigate the process, and was </p><p>expecting a report this month, but understood that competing </p><p>interests had caused a problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>REGIONAL ISSUES </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  The NSA briefly discussed sub-regional issues.  He </p><p>noted that President Obasanjo had hosted a breakfast for RUF </p><p>and GOSL officials who had attended the ECOWAS meetings.  The </p><p>RUF and GOSL officials would travel back to Freetown on May </p><p>4, all on the same plane.  According to the NSA, the group </p><p>had given Obasanjo a mandate to mediate the conflict, and had </p><p>said that three-fourths of the peace process was complete -- </p><p>all that remained was demobilization and reintegration.  The </p><p>NSA then mentioned that ULIMO-K leader Alhaji-Kromah was in </p><p>Abuja, and would meet with the President.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>noted that he had spoken by telephone with Kromah, and that </p><p>Kromah had asked for a meeting with the NSA.  Mohammed said </p><p>he would meet with him.  The Ambassador said that President </p><p>Obasanjo seemed to be doing a lot of work on Sierra Leone and </p><p>Liberia, including a trip to Burkina Faso.  The NSA agreed, </p><p>noting that during President Obasanjo\'s visit, Campaore had </p><p>committed to try to get Charles Taylor to reconcile with </p><p>Guinea.  The Ambassador asked if Nigeria would lead a meeting </p><p>on Liberian reconcilliation.  The NSA stated that there were </p><p>good alternatives to Taylor, but that most were scared, with </p><p>good reason, to return to Liberia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT:  The GON leadership seems to understand </p><p>the need for police reform, but is emphasizing the issue of </p><p>resources to explain lack of quick action thus far.  Still, </p><p>with so many institutions utterly gutted by years of military </p><p>rule, its hard to criticize Nigeria for not rebuilding more </p><p>quickly.  Embassy is hopeful that recent statements of </p><p>support for police reform by the Minister of Police Affairs </p><p>and IGP will bear fruit.  The GON\'s vision of Obasanjo\'s </p><p>visit seems to largely match Washington\'s in substance, </p><p>though there may be more individuals in the President\'s </p><p>entourage than Washington desires.  The Ambassador will have </p><p>breakfast with the President on Saturday, and will use the </p><p>meeting as an opporunity to reiterate Washington\'s vision. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
