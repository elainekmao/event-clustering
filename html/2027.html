<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002510 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, PTER, PINS, PINR, KISL, CASC, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN GOVERNORS ON SECURITY SITUATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 2421 (B) ABUJA 2347 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary: During a tour of Northern Nigeria the week </p><p>of September 23, Poloff discussed with six governors--Jigawa, </p><p>Kebbi, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kano and Kaduna--the security </p><p>situation in their respective states.  Presently army troops </p><p>are responsible for order in Kaduna, Jos, and Tafawa Balewa </p><p>(Bauchi).  The governors voiced concern about three separate </p><p>security issues: potential reprisals for the violence in Jos </p><p>and Tafawa Balewa (Bauchi State); protests sparked by the </p><p>eventual U.S. reprisal action for 9/11; and, on the more </p><p>distant horizon, political violence in the run up to 2003 </p><p>elections (electoral violence will be addressed septel). </p><p>Although ethnic violence is the primary long-term concern, </p><p>Kano, Katsina and Zamfara may see demonstrations after we </p><p>respond militarily to the terrorist attacks.  Governors there </p><p>are confident that they can prevent large-scale violence. </p><p>Most Amcits in the North are long-time residents, and are not </p><p>likely to be targeted if demonstrations turn violent.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Aftermath of Jos Violence </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C)  Governors Ahmed Makarfi (Kaduna), Rabiu Kwankwaso </p><p>(Kano) and Saminu Turaki (Jigawa) reported that their states </p><p>have been directly affected by the Jos violence.  Frightened </p><p>Plateau residents have asked to relocate to their states. </p><p>Makarfi commented that, besides Hausa-Fulani, he has received </p><p>formal requests from members of Jos\' Igbo and Yoruba </p><p>communities to relocate to Kaduna State.  Both Kaduna and </p><p>Jigawa have allocated land for new settlements for the Jos </p><p>refugees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Northern and Middle Belt governors met with the </p><p>President during the Council of State meeting on September 26 </p><p>to discuss containing ethnic violence.  Makarfi said that </p><p>President Obasanjo spent the first portion of the meeting </p><p>taking Governor Joshua Dariye (Plateau) to task for not </p><p>quelling the violence.  Makarfi recounted that Obasanjo\'s </p><p>lack of confidence in Dariye was evidenced by his creation of </p><p>a Federal judicial commission to investigate the Jos </p><p>eruption.  "He never did that for Kaduna, because he trusted </p><p>we would be fair in our investigation." Makarfi commented </p><p>that Dariye looked "ashamed," and would not make eye-contact </p><p>with his Northern colleagues at the Council of State meeting, </p><p>because they were successful in preventing violence against </p><p>Christians in their states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  The return of bodies to home states for burial has </p><p>been a traditional trigger for reprisal ethnic violence. </p><p>Consequently, the FG instituted a standing order prohibiting </p><p>the transportation of bodies across state lines, which was </p><p>implemented after the violence in Jos started.  This order </p><p>and the rapid burial of bodies in mass graves helped prevent </p><p>violence from being sparked elsewhere, Gov. Kwankwaso </p><p>remarked.  The governors also emphasized the importance of </p><p>co-ordination with traditional rulers and religious leaders </p><p>in their states to maintain order.  Makarfi stressed the </p><p>importance of traditional rulers.  According to him, </p><p>organized government only reaches to the level of the LGA\'s </p><p>(Local Government Areas).  However, traditional rulers know </p><p>and control, to a limited extent, every village in their </p><p>domain.  Makarfi and Kwankwaso averred that the Sultan and </p><p>Emirs, especially Kano and Zazzau, have worked hard to </p><p>prevent reprisals for Jos and have roundly condemned the 9/11 </p><p>attacks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The ethnic groups that targeted the Hausa-Fulani  in </p><p>Jos and Tafawa Balewa are not represented in significant </p><p>numbers in major northern cities.  Due to their geographic </p><p>concentration, reprisals by the Hausa-Fulani against these </p><p>ethnic groups could only occur in the original loci of the </p><p>violence, which are now controlled by the military.  This </p><p>geographic separation has also lessened the likelihood of </p><p>ethnic reprisals.  According to eyewitness accounts, almost </p><p>all of the Hausa have left Tafawa-Balewa.  Their exodus has </p><p>left the city without civilian local government </p><p>administration.  The military has taken its place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Makarfi said that in both Jos and Tafawa Balewa, the </p><p>local ethnic groups "touched the wrong people."  He said the </p><p>Hausa will let it go and go back to business.  "If you touch </p><p>a Fulani man, they remember and they come back--maybe ten </p><p>years later--to touch you.  Dariye is not going to sleep well </p><p>at night." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  While the "core" North seems to have prevented </p><p>further conflict, repercussions from the Jos violence </p><p>continue in the Middle Belt.  A near riot was averted in </p><p>Makurdi, Benue State, after the prompt intervention of police </p><p>September 21.  Residents of Kubwa, a reasonably affluent </p><p>exurb of Abuja, formed an inter-religious council to defuse </p><p>tensions and stem rumors of reprisals, which had heightened </p><p>tensions there considerably.  Some residents of Kubwa and </p><p>other settlements surrounding Abuja had moved, fearing </p><p>imminent violence.  The conflict in Nasarawa state in June </p><p>among the Tiv, Jukun and Hausa not only produced a </p><p>significant number of displaced persons, but has heightened </p><p>tensions in Kogi and Benue, where many of the displaced are </p><p>currently residing. </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Reactions to 9/11 </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>8. (C)  Regarding local reaction to possible U.S. military </p><p>action, Governors predicted demonstrations in Kano, Katsina </p><p>and Zamfara states, with possible demonstrations in Zaria. </p><p>With no USG institutions in the North, and with Americans </p><p>there being long-term residents, it is unlikely these </p><p>demonstrations will result in violence against Amcits.  The </p><p>demonstrations may be instigated to serve local political </p><p>ends, some governors believe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  In Zamfara, the VOA stringer in Gusau, Abdullahi </p><p>Tsafe, played a tape in Hausa for Poloff of the weekly sermon </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>delivered by the Zamfara State Commissioner of Religious </p><p>Affairs following Juma\'at prayers on September 21.  He </p><p>translated it as saying that the Commissioner implored all </p><p>Muslims to "pray for the annihilation of the U.S. if they </p><p>attack our Muslim brothers in Afghanistan."  We will report </p><p>on the situation in Zamfara in more detail (septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Governor Kwankwaso believed that "radical Muslims" </p><p>in Kano would demonstrate, but he thought their efforts would </p><p>be small-scale and he was confident in his Government\'s </p><p>ability to prevent violence.  He said he met regularly with </p><p>the mainstream Ullama and the Emir of Kano, and they have all </p><p>condemned the attacks on the U.S.  He complained that talking </p><p>to congregations associated with Iraqi mullahs was futile, </p><p>but said that these were a minority, albeit an active one. </p><p>Kwankwaso  expressed concern that U.S. action not be random </p><p>or result in needless civilian casualties, and he commented </p><p>that the only long-term solution was for Western assistance </p><p>to reduce the economic disparity between poor Muslim </p><p>populations and the West.  The other northern governors </p><p>expressed similar sentiments: each expressed his profound </p><p>condolences, followed by an expression of concern that U.S. </p><p>retaliation be measured, well-considered, and avoid civilian </p><p>casualties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U)  Comment: The ability of northern governors to </p><p>prevent reprisals in the wake of Jos represents significant </p><p>progress over the past two years. Northern governors seem </p><p>prepared for protests in response to USG military action, and </p><p>appear confident that possible violence can be contained. </p><p>Unfortunately, tensions in the Middle Belt remain high, as </p><p>multiple ethnic groups wrestle for limited economic </p><p>resources.  (The competition in some hot-spots bears </p><p>religious overtones.)  Middle Belt governors in Plateau, </p><p>Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa appear less prepared than their </p><p>northern counterparts to manage ethnic violence which may be </p><p>re-ignited by external events.  In his address on Nigeria\'s </p><p>Independence Day, President Obasanjo called ethnic violence </p><p>the biggest threat his Administration faces, and vowed to </p><p>devote more resources to stemming the problem.  Not only will </p><p>he have to devote material resources and security assets in a </p><p>more systematic way, Obasanjo must develop a political grand </p><p>strategy for dealing with this most nettlesome of Nigeria\'s </p><p>centrifugal forces.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
