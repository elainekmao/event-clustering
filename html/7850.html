<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000855 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, ELTN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe International Trade Fair 2003 -- Low </p><p>Turnout, Low Participation, Low Morale </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary:  The Zimbabwe International Trade Fair </p><p>(ZITF) is the country\'s premier trade event and was once a </p><p>regional and international showcase.  Three years ago, the </p><p>number of both local and international exhibitors started to </p><p>decline due to economic and political problems. This year </p><p>saw the worst attendance since independence in 1980, with </p><p>the ZITF boasting only five African countries and two </p><p>overseas exhibitors from a peak of 52 countries in 1997. </p><p>Even South Africa, Zimbabwe\'s largest trading partner, did </p><p>not participate for the first time since independence.  No </p><p>head of state officially opened the fair, also a first in </p><p>ZITF history.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Fuel Crisis Affects Local Participation </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU)  The acute shortage of fuel negatively affected </p><p>participation by most local exhibitors and visitors to the </p><p>fair.  A visit to the show by the Embassy\'s </p><p>economic/commercial section indicated lower exhibitor </p><p>figures than those announced by official media.  For </p><p>example, three exhibition halls, normally a hive of </p><p>activity, were completely closed and another hall for small- </p><p>scale farmers was less than half full.  No livestock was </p><p>exhibited in the agricultural section of the fair, partly </p><p>due to the uncontrolled foot and mouth disease outbreak. </p><p>Many press reports indicated that local exhibitors were </p><p>prevented from taking up their exhibition space when they </p><p>failed to source fuel to make the trip.  Despite attempts by </p><p>the Bulawayo government to minimize bad publicity by trying </p><p>to disperse fuel queues along the main travel routes, </p><p>visitors were greeted by kilometer-long lines of motorists </p><p>at almost every fuel station. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>International Exhibitors Largely Fail to Participate... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>3. (U) Through 2001, the Embassy regularly maintained a </p><p>stand at the show, including 10 or so U.S. companies and </p><p>several individual states.  At this year\'s Fair, no U.S. </p><p>company exhibited and most participators were small- to </p><p>medium-sized local companies.  We did not observe a single </p><p>foreign business executive.  Among African countries, only </p><p>Kenya, Botswana, Nigeria, Angola and Ghana attended, while </p><p>global participation was limited to Turkey and the Peoples </p><p>Republic of China.  (Government press reported Austria\'s </p><p>participation, but we only witnessed a local company that </p><p>markets Austrian solar panels occupying the country\'s former </p><p>stand.)  Normally high-profile regional and international </p><p>figures -- as well as Angolan president Dos Santos, </p><p>originally scheduled to open the show -- skipped the Fair, </p><p>yet another indication of the serious economic and political </p><p>problems the country is facing.  (Angola\'s Prime Minister </p><p>represented the country\'s president after an expected last </p><p>minute cancellation.)  Even the Government of South Africa, </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s largest trading partner, did not bother to </p><p>attend. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>... While Local Politicians Flock to the Show </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU)  Despite press reports that all accommodation in </p><p>Bulawayo, Zimbabwe\'s second city, was booked as a result of </p><p>the show, attendance at the Fair was extremely low-key.  In </p><p>fact, Zimbabwean government officials seemed to outnumber </p><p>business people.  The Ministry of Finance Permanent </p><p>Secretary, who shared a ride from the airport to the Fair </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>with us, did not even attempt to offer a positive outlook. </p><p>Instead, he fretted that South Africa was soon likely to </p><p>switch off electricity supplies to Zimbabwe due to lack of </p><p>payment. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (SBU)  The dismal attendance and participation at ZITF is </p><p>one more example of an economy in retreat.  Despite the </p><p>GOZ\'s attempts to spin this as another glorious success, few </p><p>exhibitors, including those from South Africa, saw any </p><p>advantage by making the journey to a moribund event. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
