<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000267 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAGR, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MOU: CAN\'T LIVE WITH IT, CAN\'T SURVIVE WITHOUT IT </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 239 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  The proposed Memorandum of Understanding </p><p>(MOU) between the GOZ and the Commercial Farmers\' Union </p><p>(CFU), foreshadowed in reftel, typifies the bad faith </p><p>underlying current efforts by the GOZ to use the CFU in </p><p>support of its propaganda.  The specific language in the </p><p>proposed MOU demonstrates that the GOZ\'s position is, in </p><p>effect, "what\'s yours is ours, and what\'s ours is </p><p>non-negotiable."  However, if the CFU refuses outright to </p><p>continue a dialogue with the Minister of Lands, the GOZ may </p><p>well seize the farmers\' remaining assets anyway.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The introductory rhetoric in the MOU clearly states </p><p>that:  the CFU must cooperate in order to demonstrate that it </p><p>is not acting as an "instrument of or representative of any </p><p>foreign power or interest, but as a Zimbabwean organisation </p><p>representing the interests of its members"; the 11 million </p><p>hectares seized from commercial farmers is "STATE LAND that </p><p>cannot and will not revert back to any previous status for </p><p>whatever reason whatsoever"; and "lawfully resettled farmers, </p><p>whether under the Model A1 or Model A2 schemes that are on </p><p>the 11 million hectares shall not be evicted therefrom."  In </p><p>short, by signing such an MOU, the CFU would concede defeat </p><p>on behalf of its individual members. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Further introductory clauses address the ambiguous </p><p>policy of "one man, one farm" by stating that CFU members </p><p>("and others similarly affected" -- possibly an oblique </p><p>reference to Justice for Agriculture, the hardline farmers\' </p><p>group which is pushing for farmers to retain their title </p><p>deeds and challenge the GOZ\'s program through legal action), </p><p>are eligible to receive land under the resettlement program. </p><p>However, the MOU states that such farmers "shall be </p><p>accommodated ELSEWHERE on land compulsorily acquired by the </p><p>Government for resettlement purposes, OVER AND ABOVE the </p><p>already mentioned 11 million hectares, where they shall be </p><p>allocated portions of land within and up to the applicable </p><p>maximum farm size depending on the agro-ecological region in </p><p>question (emphasis added)."  The careful phrasing of this </p><p>clause confirms the fears expressed by CFU members in </p><p>previous meetings:  the GOZ may allocate some small pieces of </p><p>marginal land, possibly virgin bush, probably several hundred </p><p>miles from their original homes, to CFU applicants -- but </p><p>only after the CFU members have turned over their title deeds </p><p>and submitted themselves to the authority of the Minister of </p><p>Lands, effectively signaling their acquiescence to their own </p><p>plunder. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  The active clauses detailed as the substantive </p><p>"record of understanding between the parties" require the CFU </p><p>to commit the personal property of its members to a </p><p>GOZ-sponsored forced purchase.  The GOZ undertakes to </p><p>guarantee that applications by CFU members for new land will </p><p>be "favourably considered" not later than August 31, 2003; in </p><p>return, the GOZ demands that the CFU urge its members to sell </p><p>and/or lease their warehoused equipment, as well as their </p><p>expertise, to the government for the use of the new farmers </p><p>resettled on their former property.  The MOU further insists </p><p>that the CFU provide the Minister of Lands with an inventory </p><p>of such moveable equipment and skills "that may be offered </p><p>for sale" or rental within thirty days of the execution of </p><p>the document.  Although the MOU, on the surface, appears to </p><p>recognize that the farm equipment in question is the </p><p>individual property of CFU members, the clear implication is </p><p>that the GOZ wants the equipment -- and may seize it if it is </p><p>not meekly offered up.  This is a potent and credible threat. </p><p> Just last week, sources reported that a government minister </p><p>broke into a warehouse and "seized" a combine tractor worth </p><p>over US$27,000 from a former commercial farmer for the </p><p>minister\'s use. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Comment.  The underlying theme of this entire </p><p>document, other than the attempt to gain access to </p><p>badly-needed agricultural equipment, is that the land </p><p>seizures will not be reversed and that the CFU should join </p><p>the GOZ in placing the responsibility for compensation on </p><p>Great Britain.  The MOU states in two separate places that </p><p>the GOZ "is ready and willing to assist the CFU to </p><p>constructively pursue and finalise the matter (compensation) </p><p>with the former colonial power or any other (identified) </p><p>party..."  This correlates with the GOZ\'s urgent request for </p><p>an exonerating "statement" which CFU president Colin Cloete </p><p>reported in his meetings with various ministers last week, </p><p>see reftel. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  In a strictly legal sense, it is highly unlikely </p><p>that the CFU has the authority to commit its individual </p><p>members to acceptance of the terms of this MOU.  Even if the </p><p>CFU president agrees that acquired land cannot and will not </p><p>revert to individual ownership, that would not preclude an </p><p>individual CFU member from pursuing a  challenge through the </p><p>courts.  Even if the CFU agrees to urge its members to sell </p><p>farm equipment to the GOZ, it cannot force a sale.  The </p><p>greatest value to the GOZ in executing this version of the </p><p>MOU lies in its propaganda value.  It would suit the GOZ\'s </p><p>frantic attempts to ease international censure if the CFU is </p><p>seen as accepting the land resettlement as a fait accompli, </p><p>for which the "former colonial power" is morally and </p><p>financially responsible.  It would also suit the GOZ if the </p><p>CFU helped persuade its members to turn over their farming </p><p>equipment to the resettled farmers -- for an unspecified </p><p>payment at an unspecified future date.  Commercial farmers </p><p>throughout the nation are carefully watching these meetings </p><p>play out, and many believe that the CFU is openly betraying </p><p>its membership by continuing a dialogue in which no </p><p>concessions or relief are gained by its members.  Ongoing </p><p>contacts with Cloete indicate that he is aware of tightrope </p><p>he is walking, and that he is unlikely to sign the MOU in its </p><p>current form.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
