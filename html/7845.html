Sensitive but unclassified, please protect </p><p>accordingly.  Not for Internet distribution. </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) The tiger\'s roar is beginning to weaken.  In </p><p>spite of a strong energy sector, respectable domestic </p><p>demand and sound provincial finances, forecasters, </p><p>including the Bank of Canada, have downgraded their </p><p>growth outlook for the Canadian economy in 2003 from </p><p>nearly 4% just a few months ago, to 2.5- 3%.  February\'s </p><p>GDP data, showing annualized GDP growth of only 2.4% </p><p>compared to a 6% annualized rate just a month earlier, </p><p>lends support to these downward revisions. Short-term </p><p>concerns include continued global economic uncertainties, </p><p>especially a delay in the U.S. economic recovery, a </p><p>stronger than anticipated Canadian currency, and the </p><p>impact of SARS in Toronto, capitol of Canada\'s largest </p><p>province and source of 20% of national GDP. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) There are some glimmering bright spots, most </p><p>notably Canada\'s energy sector and the relatively strong </p><p>fiscal position of Canada\'s ten provinces.  In fact, all </p><p>but Prince Edward Island and British Columbia project </p><p>balanced books or better, although once the full impact </p><p>of SARS emerges, Ontario\'s estimated C$524/US$367 million </p><p>surplus could erode into a deficit.  The recent sharp </p><p>rebound in U.S. consumer confidence bodes well for Canada </p><p>next year, and the Conference Board of Canada projects </p><p>that the quick victory in Iraq will trigger an economic </p><p>recovery in the United States beginning in the third </p><p>quarter of 2003.  A U.S. economic rebound will be </p><p>necessary to keep the Canadian tiger roaring.  Our </p><p>January forecast called for Canadian economic growth of </p><p>3.5% this year, increasing to 4.3% in 2004.  We are </p><p>modifying our forecast to around 3% this year and just </p><p>under 4% in 2004.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Northern Tiger Getting Tamed </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Canadian economy is still chugging along, but </p><p>less energetically than just a few months ago.  In </p><p>February, real GDP rose a modest 0.2% from January, an </p><p>annualized rate of 2.4%, representing a sharp moderation </p><p>from the 6% annualized rate recorded just a month </p><p>earlier.  In addition, February\'s gain was narrowly </p><p>based, with the continuing boom in housing construction </p><p>and its spinoffs to industries such as concrete and wood </p><p>products one of the few consistent sources of strength. </p><p>Consumer spending continues to advance based on a rebound </p><p>in auto sales, but weakness in manufacturing was evident </p><p>in two-thirds of the major industry groups. </p><p> </p><p>The Only Thing Certain Is Uncertainty </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Looking ahead, several analysts are projecting </p><p>extended weakness in Canada\'s export sector (about 38% of </p><p>GDP) because of the sluggish global economy, a delay in </p><p>the U.S. recovery, and stronger than expected </p><p>appreciation of Canada\'s dollar.  Canada\'s record </p><p>employment growth of last year has begun to ease and the </p><p>SARS outbreak in Toronto has already had an impact on the </p><p>capitol of Canada\'s largest province and source of over </p><p>20% of Canada\'s economic output -- ref C.  (Note:  The </p><p>Conference Board of Canada estimates the loss from SARS </p><p>at C$1 billion in 2003, or about half a percent of real </p><p>GDP growth in a C$2 billion economy.  End note.) </p><p>Consequently, several economists have downgraded their </p><p>forecasts of the Canadian economy for 2003 from nearly 4% </p><p>just a few months ago, to 2.5-3%. </p><p>6.   (U) The Bank of Canada\'s April 23 Semi-annual </p><p>Monetary Policy Report highlights the still-uncertain </p><p>global environment, a delay in the U.S. economic </p><p>recovery, and the SARS outbreak in Toronto, as factors </p><p>tempering upward pressure on interest rates in the short- </p><p>term.  (The BOC raised rates by 25 basis points on March </p><p>4 and April 15 of this year.)  The BOC says that while </p><p>rising interest rates and appreciation of the Canadian </p><p>dollar (up 8% since October 2002) have tightened monetary </p><p>conditions in the past year, the BOC continues to believe </p><p>that further reduction in monetary stimulus will be </p><p>necessary to return Canada\'s inflation rate (4.3% in </p><p>March; down from 4.6% in February) to the 2% target and </p><p>to sustain ouput levels close to capacity. </p><p> </p><p>Provincial Finances for FY2002-03: Lookin\' Good (Sort Of) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The tally of provincial budgets shows an </p><p>aggregate deficit of C$1.3/US$0.9 billion. (Due primarily </p><p>to a C$3.8/US$2.7 billion deficit projection for British </p><p>Columbia.)  The only other province projecting a deficit </p><p>is Prince Edward Island, but it is a marginal C$8/US$6 </p><p>million.  Energy-rich Alberta turns in the best fiscal </p><p>performance projecting a C$1.8/US$1.3 billion surplus. </p><p>In fact, Canada\'s cash-rich oilpatch faces a spending </p><p>dilemma as record quarterly profits of Alberta\'s oil </p><p>companies pour into the province.  The consensus is that </p><p>most firms will increase capital spending, look for </p><p>merger opportunities, and pay down debt.  In Ontario, the </p><p>possible C$1 billion cost of responding to SARS could </p><p>erode the C$524/US$367 million surplus projection into a </p><p>deficit.  Although the virus is now contained (Toronto </p><p>1259), the economic hit in the city that contributes 20% </p><p>to Canada\'s national GDP is already clear.  As of April </p><p>25, there had been reports of a 50% drop in Toronto hotel </p><p>occupancy rates, and a 70 to 80% loss of business for </p><p>Chinatown restaurants and shops, and an average </p><p>contraction of 30% in downtown retail sales (Toronto </p><p>1226).  Quebec, the second-largest provincial economy, </p><p>also projects a balanced budget but recent rumors of </p><p>financial irregularities may cast a shadow there as well. </p><p>The remaining provinces project small budget surpluses. </p><p> </p><p>ALL SIGNS POINT TO RECOVERY IN 2004 </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Glimmers of hope on the horizon that should </p><p>boost Canadian economic output late this year and in 2004 </p><p>include Canada\'s energy sector and the relatively strong </p><p>fiscal positions of the federal and provincial </p><p>governments.  The recent sharp rebound in U.S. consumer </p><p>confidence bodes well for Canadian exports and </p><p>manufacturing in the mid-term.  The Conference Board </p><p>predicts that the quick victory in Iraq will trigger </p><p>economic recovery in the United States beginning in the </p><p>second half of 2003, fueling a solid export recovery in </p><p>Canada in 2004.  Consequently, the Board forecasts </p><p>Canadian economic growth of 2.7% this year and 3.3% in </p><p>2004. The Bank of Montreal shares the Conference Board\'s </p><p>assumptions, and forecasts 2.4% growth in 2003, rising to </p><p>3.9% in 2004.  Our January forecast predicted growth of </p><p>3.5% this year, increasing to 4.3% in 2004.  Given the </p><p>change in circumstances, we will scale back our forecast </p><p>to around 3% for this year and to just under 4% in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
