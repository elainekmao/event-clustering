<p>UNCLAS E F T O SECTION 01 OF 10 COLOMBO 001709 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE/NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS, DRL/CRA REBECCA SCHWALBACH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KSEP, PREL, MV, Human Rights, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  Initial draft submission of the 2002 Annual </p><p>Human Rights Report for the Maldives </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  State 151191 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message is Sensitive But Unclassified and </p><p>Noforn.  Please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU/NF) Below is Mission\'s initial draft submission </p><p>of the 2002 Annual Human Rights Report for the Maldives: </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>The Republic of Maldives has a parliamentary style of </p><p>government with a strong executive. The President </p><p>appoints the cabinet, members of the judiciary, and one- </p><p>sixth of the Parliament. The President derives </p><p>additional influence from his constitutional roles as </p><p>the "supreme authority to propagate the tenets of </p><p>Islam." Political parties officially are discouraged, </p><p>and candidates for the unicameral legislature, the </p><p>People\'s Majlis, run as individuals. The Majlis selects </p><p>a single presidential nominee who is approved or </p><p>rejected in a national referendum. President Gayoom was </p><p>approved for a fifth 5-year term in 1998. The Majlis </p><p>must approve all legislation and is empowered to enact </p><p>legislation without presidential approval. Civil law is </p><p>subordinate to Shari\'a (Islamic law), but civil law </p><p>generally is applied in criminal and civil cases. The </p><p>judiciary is subject to executive influence. </p><p> </p><p>The National Security Service (NSS) performs its duties </p><p>under effective civilian control. The NSS includes the </p><p>armed forces and police, and its members serve in both </p><p>police and military capacities during their careers. The </p><p>director of the NSS reports to the minister of defense. </p><p>The police division investigates crimes, collects </p><p>intelligence, makes arrests, and enforces house arrest. </p><p> </p><p>Tourism and fishing provide employment for more than </p><p>one-half of the work force. Tourism accounts for 30 </p><p>percent of government revenues and roughly 70 percent of </p><p>foreign exchange receipts. The population is </p><p>approximately 290,000. Agriculture and manufacturing </p><p>continue to play a minor role in the economy, which is </p><p>constrained by a severe shortage of labor and lack of </p><p>arable land. In 2001 gross domestic product (GDP) per </p><p>capita was $2,100 (25,892 Rufiyaa), and the GDP growth </p><p>rate was approximately 2 percent. </p><p> </p><p>The government generally respected the human rights of </p><p>its citizens; however, problems remain in some areas. </p><p>The President\'s power to appoint a significant portion </p><p>of the Parliament constrains citizens\' ability to change </p><p>their government. The Government limits freedom of </p><p>assembly and association, and does not permit the </p><p>formation of political parties. There were significant </p><p>restrictions on the freedom of religion. In the past, </p><p>the Government has detained arbitrarily and expelled </p><p>foreigners for proselytizing and detained citizens who </p><p>converted. Although the Government has undertaken a </p><p>number of programs addressing women\'s issues, women </p><p>faced a variety of legal and social disadvantages. The </p><p>Government also restricted certain worker rights. The </p><p>Press Council\'s balanced handling of issues related to </p><p>journalistic standards allowed a greater diversity of </p><p>views in the media. </p><p> </p><p>RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, </p><p>Including Freedom From: </p><p> </p><p>A. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of the arbitrary or unlawful </p><p>deprivation of life committed by the Government or its </p><p>agents. </p><p> </p><p>B. Disappearance </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of politically motivated </p><p>disappearances. </p><p> </p><p>C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading </p><p>Treatment or Punishment </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits such practices, and there were no </p><p>reports that government officials employed them. There </p><p>were no credible reports of beatings or other </p><p>mistreatment of persons in police custody during the </p><p>year. Some sources claim that the police have on </p><p>occasion tortured anti-government detainees.  There were </p><p>no reports of public floggings (which are allowed under </p><p>Shari\'a as interpreted in the country), as in past </p><p>years. Punishments usually are confined to fines, </p><p>compensatory payment, house arrest, imprisonment, or </p><p>banishment to a remote atoll. The government generally </p><p>permits those who are banished to receive visits by </p><p>family members. </p><p> </p><p>The country\'s prison was destroyed by fire in 1999. </p><p>Following the fire, the government transferred prisoners </p><p>to a temporary facility, which houses a fluctuating </p><p>population of approximately 300 inmates. </p><p> </p><p>Prison conditions at the existing facility, including </p><p>food and housing, generally are adequate. Prisoners are </p><p>allowed to work and are given the opportunity for </p><p>regular exercise and recreation. Spouses are allowed </p><p>privacy during visits with incarcerated partners. The </p><p>Government is surveying prison facilities in other </p><p>countries to incorporate international standards and </p><p>improvements in the reconstruction of the prison, and it </p><p>has requested training for prison guards. Women are held </p><p>separately from men. Children are held separately from </p><p>adults. Persons arrested for drug use are sent to a </p><p>"drug rehabilitation center" (on a space available </p><p>basis) where sleeping quarters and most activities are </p><p>segregated; although common areas are shared by all. </p><p> </p><p>The Government has permitted prison visits by foreign </p><p>diplomats. The issue of visits by human rights groups </p><p>was not known to have arisen during the year. </p><p> </p><p>D. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution states that no person shall be arrested </p><p>or detained for more than 24 hours without being </p><p>informed of the grounds for arrest or detention. </p><p> </p><p>Police initiate investigations based on suspicion of </p><p>criminal activity or in response to written complaints </p><p>from citizens, police officers, or government officials. </p><p>They are not required to obtain warrants for arrests. </p><p>Based on the results of police investigations, the </p><p>Attorney General refers cases to the appropriate court. </p><p>The authorities generally keep the details of a case </p><p>confidential until they are confident that the charges </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>are likely to be upheld. In the past, persons have been </p><p>held for long periods without charge, but there were no </p><p>reports of such occurrences during the year. </p><p> </p><p>Depending upon the charges, a suspect may remain free, </p><p>be detained in prison, or placed under house arrest for </p><p>15 days during investigations. The President may extend </p><p>pretrial detention for an additional 30 days, but in </p><p>most cases the suspect is released if not brought to </p><p>trial within 15 days. Those who are released pending </p><p>trial may not leave a specific atoll. Within 24 hours of </p><p>an arrest, an individual must be told of the grounds for </p><p>the arrest. An individual can then be held for 7 days. </p><p>If no legal proceedings have been initiated within 7 </p><p>days, the case is referred to an anonymous 3-member </p><p>civilian commission appointed by the President that can </p><p>authorize an additional 15 days of detention. After that </p><p>time, if legal proceedings still have not been </p><p>initiated, a judge must sanction the continued detention </p><p>on a monthly basis. Although there is no right to legal </p><p>counsel during police interrogation, detainees are </p><p>granted access to family members. There is no provision </p><p>for bail. </p><p> </p><p>The government may prohibit access to a telephone and </p><p>nonfamily visits to those under house arrest. While </p><p>there have been no reported cases of incommunicado </p><p>detention in the past few years, the law does not </p><p>provide safeguards against this abuse. </p><p> </p><p>According to Amnesty International and other sources, in </p><p>early 2002, four individuals were arrested for </p><p>distributing Islamist and anti-government literature. </p><p>After one of the men was released, three of the men were </p><p>standing trial for alleged extremism and subversion as </p><p>of summer 2002.  In addition, a Muslim clergyman </p><p>reportedly was questioned and temporarily detained in </p><p>June 2002 during an investigation into accusations that </p><p>he had made Islamist-tinged sermons. </p><p> </p><p>Member of Parliament (MP) Abdullah Shakir was arrested </p><p>in July 2001 and released the following month. There is </p><p>some dispute as to why he was arrested; the government </p><p>states he was arrested on a purely civil matter, which </p><p>has since been resolved, but international human rights </p><p>groups claim that he was arrested for his support of a </p><p>petition to form political parties in the country (see </p><p>section 2.b.). </p><p> </p><p>MP Mohammed Nasheed was convicted of theft in early </p><p>2002.  He was subsequently expelled from the Majlis.  He </p><p>was reportedly released from internal exile in late </p><p>August.  Some have claimed that the government framed </p><p>Nasheed because Nasheed signed the petition mentioned </p><p>above supporting the formation of political parties (see </p><p>section 2.b.) </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of the external exile of citizens </p><p>during the year. In the past, the government sometimes </p><p>has banished convicted criminals to inhabited atolls </p><p>away from their home communities, but there were no </p><p>reports of this occurring during the year. </p><p> </p><p>E. Denial of Fair Public Trial </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution does not provide for an independent </p><p>judiciary, and the judiciary is subject to executive </p><p>influence. In addition to his authority to review high </p><p>court decisions, the President influences the judiciary </p><p>through his power to appoint and dismiss judges, all of </p><p>whom serve at his pleasure and are not subject to </p><p>confirmation by the Majlis. The President also may grant </p><p>pardons and amnesties. </p><p> </p><p>There are three courts: one for civil matters; one for </p><p>criminal cases; and one for family and juvenile cases. </p><p>On the recommendation of the Ministry of Justice, the </p><p>President appoints a principal judge for each court. </p><p>There is also a High Court in Male, which is independent </p><p>of the Justice Ministry and which handles a wide range </p><p>of cases, including politically sensitive ones. The High </p><p>Court also acts as court of appeals. High Court rulings </p><p>can be reviewed by a five-member advisory council </p><p>appointed by the President. The President also has </p><p>authority to affirm judgments of the High Court, to </p><p>order a second hearing, or to overturn the court\'s </p><p>decision. In addition to the Male court, there are 204 </p><p>general courts on the islands. </p><p> </p><p>There are no jury trials. Most trials are public and </p><p>conducted by judges and magistrates trained in Islamic, </p><p>civil, and criminal law. Magistrates usually adjudicate </p><p>cases on outer islands, but when more complex legal </p><p>questions are involved, the Justice Ministry will send </p><p>more experienced judges to handle the case. </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides that an accused person be </p><p>presumed innocent until proven guilty, and that an </p><p>accused person has the right to defend himself "in </p><p>accordance with Shari\'a." During a trial, the accused </p><p>also may call witnesses, and be assisted by a lawyer. </p><p>Courts do not provide lawyers to indigent defendants. </p><p>Judges question the concerned parties and attempt to </p><p>establish the facts of a case. </p><p> </p><p>Civil law is subordinate to Shari\'a, which is applied in </p><p>situations not covered by civil law as well as in </p><p>certain acts such as divorce and adultery. Courts </p><p>adjudicating matrimonial and criminal cases generally do </p><p>not allow legal counsel in court because, according to </p><p>local interpretation of Shari\'a, all answers and </p><p>submissions should come directly from the parties </p><p>involved. However, the High Court allows legal counsel </p><p>in all cases, including those in which the rights to </p><p>counsel was denied in lower court. Under the country\'s </p><p>Islamic practice, the testimony of two women is required </p><p>to equal that of one man in matters involving Shari\'a, </p><p>such as adultery, finance, and inheritance. In other </p><p>cases, the testimony of men and women are equal. </p><p> </p><p>There were no confirmed reports of political prisoners. </p><p>(see section 1.d. for information on detainees.) </p><p> </p><p>F. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or </p><p>Correspondence </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits security officials from </p><p>opening or reading letters, telegrams, and wireless </p><p>messages or monitoring telephone conversations, "except </p><p>as expressly provided by law." The NSS may open the mail </p><p>of private citizens and monitor telephone conversations </p><p>if authorized in the course of a criminal investigation. </p><p> </p><p>Although the Constitution provides that residential </p><p>premises and dwellings should be inviolable, there is no </p><p>legal requirement for search or arrest warrants. The </p><p>Attorney General or a commanding officer of the police </p><p>must approve the search of private residences. </p><p>The Government policy to encourage a concentration of </p><p>the population on the larger islands continued, and the </p><p>policy generally was successful in moving a significant </p><p>number of citizens to the larger islands. </p><p> </p><p>Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including: </p><p> </p><p>A. Freedom of Speech and Press </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits public statements that are contrary to </p><p>Islam, threaten the public order, or are libelous. The </p><p>Penal Code prohibits inciting citizens against the </p><p>Government. However, an amendment to the penal code </p><p>decriminalized "true account(s)" by journalists of </p><p>governmental actions. </p><p> </p><p>Regulations that make publishers responsible for the </p><p>content of the material they published remain in effect, </p><p>but no legal actions against publishers were initiated </p><p>during the year. </p><p> </p><p>The Press Council is composed of lawyers, private and </p><p>government media representatives, and other government </p><p>officials. The Council reviews charges of journalistic </p><p>misconduct (advising the Ministry of Information, Arts, </p><p>and Culture on measures to be taken against reporters, </p><p>when appropriate) and promotes professional standards </p><p>within the media by recommending reforms and making </p><p>suggestions for improvement. Private journalists have </p><p>said that they are satisfied with the Council\'s </p><p>objectivity and performance. The Government agreed that </p><p>private journalists, rather than the Government, should </p><p>take responsibility for preparation of a journalistic </p><p>code of ethics. Individual newspapers and journals </p><p>established their own ethical guidelines in many cases. </p><p> </p><p>Most major media outlets are owned either by the </p><p>government or its sympathizers. Nonetheless, these </p><p>sympathetic outlets do on occasion strongly criticize </p><p>the Government. </p><p> </p><p>Over 200 newspapers and periodicals are registered with </p><p>the Government, only some of which publish on a regular </p><p>basis. Aafathis, a morning daily, often is critical of </p><p>government policy, as is the Monday Times, a weekly </p><p>English language magazine. Two dailies, Miadhu and </p><p>Haveeru, are progovernment. </p><p> </p><p>The Government owns and operates the only television and </p><p>radio stations. It does not interfere with foreign </p><p>broadcasts or with the sale of satellite receivers. </p><p>Reports drawn from foreign newscasts are aired on the </p><p>government television station. Cable News Network (CNN) </p><p>is shown daily, uncensored, on local television. </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of Government censorship of the </p><p>electronic media; nor were there closures of any </p><p>publications or reports of intimidation of journalists. </p><p> </p><p>Television news and public affairs programming routinely </p><p>discussed topics of concern and freely criticized </p><p>government performance. Regular press conferences with </p><p>government ministers instituted in 1995 continued. </p><p>Journalists are more self-confident than in the past; </p><p>self-censorship appears to have diminished, although it </p><p>remains a problem. Since it is not clear when criticism </p><p>violates the law prohibiting public statements that are </p><p>contrary to Islam, threaten the public, or are libelous, </p><p>journalists and publishers continue to watch what they </p><p>say, particularly on political topics, to avoid censure </p><p>by the Government. </p><p> </p><p>There are no legal prohibitions on the import of foreign </p><p>publications except for those containing pornography or </p><p>material otherwise deemed objectionable to Islamic </p><p>values. No seizures of foreign publications were </p><p>reported during the year. </p><p> </p><p>The Internet is available. There were no government </p><p>attempts, other than blocking pornographic material, to </p><p>interfere with its use. </p><p> </p><p>There are no reported restrictions on academic freedom. </p><p>Some teachers reportedly are vocal in their criticism of </p><p>the government. </p><p> </p><p>B. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly </p><p>"peaceably and in a manner that does not contravene the </p><p>law;" however, the Government imposes limits on this </p><p>right in practice. The Home Ministry permits public </p><p>political meetings during electoral campaigns, but </p><p>limits them to small gatherings on private premises. </p><p> </p><p>The Government registers clubs and other private </p><p>associations if they do not contravene Islamic or civil </p><p>law. The Government imposes some limits on freedom of </p><p>association. While not forbidden by law, the President </p><p>officially discourages political parties on the grounds </p><p>that they are inappropriate to the homogeneous nature of </p><p>society. The President reaffirmed this position when he </p><p>decided against a petition to form a political party in </p><p>June 2001. One signatory to the petition was M.P. </p><p>Abdullah shakir. </p><p> </p><p>Shakir later was arrested, but was released soon </p><p>thereafter. Some observers believe that his arrest was </p><p>connected to his support for the creation of political </p><p>parties in the country, but the Government maintains </p><p>that he was arrested in connection with a civil matter </p><p>(see section 1.e.). There were multiple unconfirmed </p><p>reports that the Government has harassed other </p><p>politicians who signed the petition to form political </p><p>parties.  Mohammed Nasheed, for example, lost his seat </p><p>in the Majlis when he was convicted of petty theft in </p><p>early 2002.  He was reportedly released from internal </p><p>exile in late August.  Some observers claim that the </p><p>theft charge was trumped up to punish Nasheed for </p><p>supporting a movement to form a political party and for </p><p>his criticism of President Gayoom (see section 3). </p><p>Despite these reports, many Majlis members were active </p><p>and outspoken critics of the government and called for </p><p>closer parliamentary examination of government policy. </p><p> </p><p>Although not prohibited, there are no active local human </p><p>rights groups in the country. The Government has been </p><p>responsive to requests from foreign governments and </p><p>international organizations to examine human rights </p><p>issues. While the Government also does not prohibit </p><p>labor unions, it recognizes neither the right to form </p><p>them nor the right to strike. There were no reports of </p><p>efforts to form unions or to strike during the year. </p><p> </p><p>C. Freedom of Religion </p><p> </p><p>Freedom of Religion is restricted significantly. The </p><p>Constitution designates the Sunni branch of Islam as the </p><p>official state religion, and the Government interprets </p><p>this provision to impose a requirement that citizens be </p><p>Muslims. The practice of any religion other than Islam </p><p>is prohibited by law. However, non-Muslim foreign </p><p>residents are allowed to practice their religion if they </p><p>do so privately and do not encourage citizens to </p><p>participate. President Gayoom repeatedly has stated that </p><p>no other religion should be allowed in the country, and </p><p>the Home Affairs Ministry has announced special programs </p><p>to safeguard and strengthen religious unity. The </p><p>President, the members of the People\'s Majlis, and </p><p>cabinet members must be Muslims. </p><p> </p><p>There are no places of worship for adherents of other </p><p>religions. The government prohibits the importation of </p><p>icons and religious statues, but it generally permits </p><p>the importation of individual religious literature, such </p><p>as Bibles, for personal use. It also prohibits non- </p><p>Muslim clergy and missionaries from proselytizing and </p><p>conducting public worship services. Conversion of a </p><p>Muslim to another faith is a violation of Shari\'a and </p><p>may result in punishment. In the past, would-be converts </p><p>have been detained and counseled regarding their </p><p>conversion from Islam. Foreigners have been detained and </p><p>expelled for proselytizing. Unlike in previous years, </p><p>there were no reports of foreigners being detained for </p><p>proselytizing. </p><p> </p><p>Islamic instruction is a mandatory part of the school </p><p>curriculum, and the Government funds the salaries of </p><p>religious instructors. The Government has established a </p><p>Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs to provide guidance </p><p>on religious matters. The Government also has set </p><p>standards for individuals who conduct Friday services at </p><p>mosques to ensure adequate theological qualifications, </p><p>and to ensure that services are not dominated by </p><p>radicals.  A Muslim clergyman accused of making an </p><p>Islamist tinged sermon was reportedly detained in June </p><p>2002, but was quickly released (see section 1.d.). </p><p> </p><p>Under the country\'s Islamic practice, certain legal </p><p>provisions discriminate against women (see sections </p><p>1.e., 3, and 5). </p><p>D. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign </p><p>Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation </p><p>Citizens are free to travel at home and abroad, to </p><p>emigrate, and to return. Because of overcrowding, the </p><p>government discourages migration to the capital island </p><p>of Male or its surrounding atoll. Foreign workers often </p><p>are housed at their worksites. Their ability to travel </p><p>freely is restricted, and they are not allowed to mingle </p><p>with the local population on the islands. </p><p> </p><p>The law does not provide for the granting of asylum or </p><p>refugee status in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention </p><p>Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 </p><p>Protocol. The Government has not formulated a policy </p><p>regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum. The issue </p><p>of the provision of first asylum did not arise during </p><p>the year. The Government cooperates with the office of </p><p>the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. There were no </p><p>reports of the forced return of persons to a country </p><p>where they feared persecution. </p><p> </p><p>Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: the Right of </p><p>Citizens to Change Their Government </p><p> </p><p>Citizens\' ability to change their government is </p><p>constrained, and the strong executive exerts significant </p><p>influence over both the legislature and the judiciary. </p><p>Under the Constitution, the Majlis chooses a single </p><p>presidential nominee, who must be a Sunni Muslim male, </p><p>from a list of self-announced candidates for the </p><p>nomination. Would-be nominees for president are not </p><p>permitted to campaign for the nomination. The nominee is </p><p>then confirmed or rejected by secret ballot in a </p><p>nationwide referendum. From a field of five candidates, </p><p>President Gayoom was nominated by the Majlis and was </p><p>confirmed by referendum for a fifth 5-year term in 1998. </p><p>Observers from the South Asian Association for Regional </p><p>Cooperation found the referendum to be free and fair. </p><p> </p><p>The Office of the President is the most powerful </p><p>political institution. The Constitution gives Shari\'a </p><p>preeminence over civil law and designates the President </p><p>as the "supreme authority to propagate the tenets" of </p><p>Islam. The President\'s authority to appoint one-sixth of </p><p>the Majlis members, which is one-third of the total </p><p>needed for nominating the President, provides the </p><p>President with a power base and strong political </p><p>leverage. The President also is Commander in Chief of </p><p>the armed forces, the Minister of Defense and National </p><p>Security, the Minister of Finance and Treasury, and the </p><p>Governor of the Maldivian Monetary Authority. </p><p> </p><p>The elected members of the Majlis, who must be Muslims, </p><p>serve 5-year terms. All citizens over 21 years of age </p><p>may vote. Of the body\'s 50 members, 42 are elected and </p><p>the president appoints 8 members. Individuals or groups </p><p>are free to approach members of the Majlis with </p><p>grievances or opinions on proposed legislation, and any </p><p>member may introduce legislation. There are no political </p><p>parties, which are officially discouraged (see section </p><p>1.b.). </p><p> </p><p>Relations between the government and the Majlis have </p><p>been constructive. The government may introduce </p><p>legislation but may not enact a bill into law without </p><p>the Majlis\' approval. The Majlis may enact legislation </p><p>into law without presidential assent if the president </p><p>fails to act on the proposal within 30 days or if a bill </p><p>is repassed with a two-thirds majority. In the past few </p><p>years, the Majlis increasingly has become independent, </p><p>challenging government policies and rejecting </p><p>government-proposed legislation. </p><p> </p><p>For the past several years, the Majlis has held a </p><p>question period during which members may question </p><p>government ministers about public policy. Debate on the </p><p>floor since the question period was instituted has </p><p>become increasingly sharp and open. Elections to the </p><p>people\'s Majlis were last held in 1999. According to </p><p>observers from the South Asian Association for Regional </p><p>Cooperation (SAARC), the elections were generally free </p><p>and fair. </p><p> </p><p>A by-election was held in April following the </p><p>controversial expulsion of MP Mohammed Nasheed from the </p><p>Majlis upon his conviction for theft (see section 2.b.). </p><p>The election itself was generally thought to be free and </p><p>fair, with the pro-government candidate winning in a </p><p>competitive race. </p><p>The percentage of women in government and politics does </p><p>not correspond to their percentage of the population. </p><p>Women are not eligible to become president but may hold </p><p>other government posts. However, for reasons of </p><p>tradition and culture, relatively few women seek or are </p><p>selected for public office.  Women reportedly have been </p><p>offered the position of Atoll Chief in the past, but in </p><p>December 2001 was the first time a woman accepted the </p><p>position.  In order to increase participation by women </p><p>in the political process, the Government continued a </p><p>political awareness campaign in the atolls. In the </p><p>November 1999 elections, six women ran for seats and two </p><p>were elected. During the 1999 elections, observers from </p><p>the SAARC noted that women participated equally in the </p><p>electoral process. Following the elections, President </p><p>Gayoom appointed an additional three women to the </p><p>Majlis. </p><p> </p><p>Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International </p><p>and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations </p><p>of Human Rights </p><p> </p><p>Although not prohibited, there are no active local human </p><p>rights groups. The government has been very responsive </p><p>to the interest of foreign governments in examining </p><p>human rights issues. A number of international human </p><p>rights organizations, such as UNICEF, are present in the </p><p>country. The government cooperates with these </p><p>international organizations. </p><p> </p><p>Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, </p><p>Disability, Language, or Social Status </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for the equality of all </p><p>citizens before the law, but there is no specific </p><p>provision to prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, </p><p>religion, disability, or social status. Women </p><p>traditionally have been disadvantaged, particularly in </p><p>terms of the application of Shari\'a, in matters such as </p><p>divorce, education, inheritance, and testimony in legal </p><p>proceedings. </p><p> </p><p>Women </p><p> </p><p>Women\'s rights advocates agree that domestic violence </p><p>and other forms of violence against women are not </p><p>widespread. There are no firm data on the extent of </p><p>violence against women because of the value attached to </p><p>privacy. Police officials report that they receive few </p><p>complaints of assaults against women. Rape and other </p><p>violent crimes against women are extremely rare. Under </p><p>Shari\'a the penalty would be flogging, banishment, or </p><p>imprisonment for up to 5 years. </p><p> </p><p>Although women traditionally have played a subordinate </p><p>role in society, they participate in public life and </p><p>gradually are participating at higher levels.  December </p><p>24, 2001, for example, was the first time a woman </p><p>accepted a nomination to the position of Atoll Chief </p><p>(see section 3).  There is also one woman minister, the </p><p>Minister of Women\'s Affairs and Social Welfare.  Women </p><p>constitute close to 38 percent of government employees, </p><p>and approximately 10 percent of uniformed NSS personnel. </p><p>Well-educated women maintain that cultural norms, not </p><p>the law, inhibit women\'s education and career choices. </p><p>However, during the year, the Government continued law </p><p>literacy programs and workshops on gender and political </p><p>awareness in the outer atolls to make women aware of </p><p>their legal rights. The Government also has built 15 </p><p>women\'s centers in the atolls, which are facilities </p><p>where family health workers can provide medical </p><p>services. The centers also provide libraries and space </p><p>for meetings and other activities with a focus on the </p><p>development of women.  In addition, in July 2001 the </p><p>Maldivian Government passed a family law that makes 18 </p><p>the minimum age of marriage for women.  This law is seen </p><p>as a way to encourage women to continue higher </p><p>education. </p><p> </p><p>Under Islamic practice, husbands may divorce their wives </p><p>more easily than vice versa, absent any mutual agreement </p><p>to divorce. Shari\'a also governs intestate inheritance, </p><p>granting male heirs twice the share of female heirs. A </p><p>woman\'s testimony is equal only to one-half of that of a </p><p>man in matters involving adultery, finance, and </p><p>inheritance (see section 1.e.). Women who work for wages </p><p>receive pay equal to that of men in the same positions. </p><p> </p><p>In 2000 the Cabinet created a Gender Equality Council to </p><p>serve as an advisory body to the Government to help </p><p>strengthen the role of women in society and to help </p><p>ensure equal participation by women in the country\'s </p><p>development; however, there were no reports of specific </p><p>council actions during the year. </p><p> </p><p>Children </p><p>The government does not have a program of compulsory </p><p>education, but it provides universal access to free </p><p>primary education. The percentage of school-age children </p><p>in school in 2001 was as follows: (grades 1 to 5) 99 </p><p>percent; (grades 6 to 7) 96 percent; and grades (8 to </p><p>10) 51 percent. Of the students enrolled, 49 percent are </p><p>female and 51 percent are male. In many instances, </p><p>education for girls is curtailed after the seventh </p><p>grade, largely because parents do not allow girls to </p><p>leave their home island for an island having a secondary </p><p>school. Nevertheless, women enjoy a higher literacy rate </p><p>(98 percent) than men (96 percent). The Government is </p><p>committed to the protection of children\'s rights and </p><p>welfare. The Government is working with UNICEF to </p><p>implement the rights provided for in the UN Convention </p><p>on the Rights of the Child, which the Maldivian Majlis </p><p>ratified in 1991. The Government maintains a National </p><p>Council for the Protection of the Rights of the Child. </p><p>Government policy provides for equal access to </p><p>educational and health programs for both male and female </p><p>children.  In May 2002, the Government ratified two </p><p>Optional Protocols, on the Children in Armed Conflict </p><p>and Sale of Children, of the UN Convention on Children. </p><p> </p><p>Children\'s rights are incorporated into law, which </p><p>specifically protects them from both physical and </p><p>psychological abuse, including abuse at the hands of </p><p>teachers or parents. The Ministry of Women\'s Affairs and </p><p>Social Welfare has the authority to enforce this law, </p><p>takes its responsibility seriously, and has received </p><p>strong popular support for its efforts. Although unable </p><p>to provide an exact number, the Ministry noted that </p><p>there continued to be reports of child abuse during the </p><p>year, including sexual abuse. Penalties for the sexual </p><p>abuse of children range from banishment to imprisonment </p><p>for up to 3 years. It is not known if there were any </p><p>prosecutions for child abuse or child sexual abuse </p><p>during the year. The Government continues to review the </p><p>law to see if improvements and additional protections </p><p>are necessary. </p><p> </p><p>Persons with Disabilities </p><p> </p><p>There is no law that specifically addresses the rights </p><p>of persons with physical or mental disabilities. In 1999 </p><p>the Government initiated a survey that identified 30,000 </p><p>persons with disabilities in the country (primarily </p><p>hearing and visually impaired). The Government has </p><p>established programs and provided services for persons </p><p>with disabilities. </p><p> </p><p>Persons with disabilities usually are cared for by their </p><p>families. When family care is unavailable, persons with </p><p>disabilities are kept in the institute for needy people, </p><p>which also assists elderly persons. The Government </p><p>provides free medication for all mentally ill persons in </p><p>the islands, and mobile teams regularly visit mentally </p><p>ill patients. In 1999 the Government enacted and is </p><p>reportedly enforcing a new building code, which mandated </p><p>that all new government buildings and jetties must be </p><p>accessible to persons with disabilities. </p><p> </p><p>Section 6 Worker Rights </p><p> </p><p>A. The Right of Association </p><p> </p><p>While the Government does not expressly prohibit unions, </p><p>it recognizes neither the right to form them nor the </p><p>right to strike. There were no reports of efforts to </p><p>form unions or of strikes during the year. However, </p><p>small groups of similarly employed workers with mutual </p><p>interests (for example fishermen) have formed </p><p>associations, which include employers as well as </p><p>employees. These associations may address a variety of </p><p>issues, including workers\' rights. </p><p> </p><p>The work force consists of between 70,000 and 75,000 </p><p>persons, including expatriate labor and seasonal and </p><p>part-time workers. The approximately 29,200 foreigners </p><p>who work in the country make up almost half of the </p><p>workers in the formal sector; most are employed in </p><p>hotels, in factories, on construction projects, finance, </p><p>education, and other service industries. The Government </p><p>employs approximately 26,700 persons, both permanent and </p><p>temporary. It estimates that the manufacturing sector </p><p>employs approximately 15 percent of the labor force and </p><p>tourism another 10 percent. </p><p>Although workers can affiliate with international labor </p><p>federations, this generally has not been the case. It is </p><p>believed some seamen have joined such federations, </p><p>however. </p><p>In 1995 the U.S. Government suspended the country\'s </p><p>eligibility for tariff preferences under the U.S. </p><p>Generalized System of Preferences because the Government </p><p>failed to take steps to afford internationally </p><p>recognized worker rights to workers. </p><p> </p><p>B. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively </p><p> </p><p>The law neither prohibits nor protects workers\' rights </p><p>to organize and bargain collectively. Wages in the </p><p>private sector are set by contract between employers and </p><p>employees and are usually based on the rates for similar </p><p>work in the public sector. There are no laws </p><p>specifically prohibiting antiunion discrimination by </p><p>employers against union members or organizers. </p><p> </p><p>There are no export processing zones. </p><p> </p><p>C. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor </p><p> </p><p>The law does not prohibit forced or compulsory labor; </p><p>however, there were no reports that such practices </p><p>occurred. The Government does not specifically prohibit </p><p>forced and bonded labor by children; however, there were </p><p>no reports that such practices occurred. </p><p> </p><p>D. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for </p><p>Employment </p><p> </p><p>There is no compulsory education law, but almost 98 </p><p>percent of school-age children to grade 7 are enrolled </p><p>in school (see section 5). The law bars children under </p><p>14 years of age from "places of waged work and from work </p><p>that is not suitable for that child\'s age, health, or </p><p>physical ability or that might obstruct the education or </p><p>adversely affect the mentality or behavior of the </p><p>child." The law also prohibits government employment of </p><p>children under the age of 16. There are no reports of </p><p>children being employed in the small industrial sector, </p><p>although children work in family fishing, agricultural, </p><p>and commercial activities. The hours of work of young </p><p>workers are not limited specifically by statute. The </p><p>Government does not specifically prohibit forced and </p><p>bonded labor by children; however, there were no reports </p><p>that such practices occurred. A unit for children\'s </p><p>rights in the Ministry of Women\'s Affairs and Social </p><p>Welfare is responsible only for monitoring compliance </p><p>with the child labor regulations, not enforcement. </p><p> </p><p>E. Acceptable Conditions of Work </p><p> </p><p>The regulations for employee relations specify the terms </p><p>that must be incorporated into employment contracts and </p><p>address such issues as training, work hours, safety, </p><p>remuneration, leave, fines, and termination. There is no </p><p>national minimum wage for the private sector, although </p><p>the Government has established wage floors for certain </p><p>kinds of work such as government employment, which </p><p>provides a decent standard of living for a worker and </p><p>family. Given the severe shortage of labor, employers </p><p>must offer competitive pay and conditions to attract </p><p>skilled workers. </p><p> </p><p>There are no statutory provisions for hours of work, but </p><p>the regulations require that a work contract specify the </p><p>normal work and overtime hours on a weekly or monthly </p><p>basis. In the public sector, a 7 hour day and a 5 day </p><p>workweek have been established through administrative </p><p>circulars from the President\'s office. Overtime pay in </p><p>the public sector was instituted in 1990. There are no </p><p>laws governing health and safety conditions. There are </p><p>regulatory requirements that employers provide a safe </p><p>working environment and ensure the observance of safety </p><p>measures. It is unclear whether workers can remove </p><p>themselves from unsafe working conditions without </p><p>risking the loss of their jobs. The Ministry of Trade, </p><p>Industries, and Labor has a labor dispute settlement </p><p>unit to resolve wage and labor disputes and to visit </p><p>worksites and enforce labor regulations. </p><p> </p><p>With the help of the ILO, two draft labor laws were </p><p>prepared in 1998: one to address issues such as the </p><p>right of association, the right to organize, and </p><p>acceptable work conditions related to health, </p><p>environment, employer-employee relations, leave, and </p><p>termination, and the other to deal with social security, </p><p>pensions, and provident funds. These laws had not been </p><p>enacted by year\'s end. </p><p>F. Trafficking in Persons </p><p>The law does not prohibit trafficking in persons; </p><p>however, there were no reports that persons were </p><p>trafficked to, from, or within the country. The Attorney </p><p>General\'s office believes that should a case arise, it </p><p>could be addressed under Shari\'a. </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
