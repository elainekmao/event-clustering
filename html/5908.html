RANGOON 30 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The simultaneous crash of the formal and </p><p>informal banking sectors in Burma starting February 14 led </p><p>many to expect the worst.  Although day laborers and small </p><p>depositors have been hit the hardest, thus far calm has </p><p>dominated.  People are frustrated, but not angry enough to </p><p>take political action.  The reasons for this tranquillity are </p><p>manifold, but primarily revolve around the relatively small </p><p>role played by the financial sector here as well as the </p><p>seemingly endless patience of the Burmese people.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>Trust in Private Banks is Weak </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) With all the concern about the recent private banking </p><p>crisis, it is important to remember that out of an IMF </p><p>estimated 1.3 trillion kyat (M2) sloshing through the white, </p><p>brown, and black markets of Burma, the twenty private banks </p><p>estimated that they held only 550 billion kyat when the </p><p>recent crisis hit on February 14.  The rest was on deposit </p><p>with the informal banking sector, out in circulation as cash </p><p>in the hands of the public, or in the state-owned banks.  The </p><p>result is that the formal banking system in Burma does not </p><p>have deep roots.  Private banking has been available for less </p><p>than ten years, and many average Burmese have been slow to </p><p>understand and trust the system.  In addition, the GOB\'s </p><p>artificial ceiling on deposit rates (10 percent per year) has </p><p>been a major disincentive to depositors facing inflation </p><p>rates of 60 percent and higher.  Finally, the steady </p><p>depreciation of the kyat over the past several years (down </p><p>315 percent against the dollar since January 2000) has </p><p>dissuaded private and corporate customers from keeping many </p><p>kyat assets.  One estimate we heard was that 90 percent of </p><p>the business community keeps little or no kyat (either in the </p><p>bank or on hand), preferring to change all kyat immediately </p><p>into gold or dollars, which can be cashed in as need be. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Those lining up outside banks over the past week are </p><p>primarily traders, who keep money in the banks for a short </p><p>time to facilitate transactions or secure access to credit; </p><p>some private companies who use banks for handling accounts </p><p>receivable and payroll; and a few smaller depositors who were </p><p>too honest to invest their kyat in real assets or the </p><p>informal banking sector, and too nervous of demonetization to </p><p>keep money under their pillows.  Very few of the elite rely </p><p>significantly on the banking system, instead keeping their </p><p>money in real estate, autos, dollars, gold, or other rapidly </p><p>appreciating assets. </p><p> </p><p>Pay Packet Comes With Apologies </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The average Burmese is harder hit by the decline of </p><p>the formal banking sector as a wage earner than as a </p><p>depositor.  Large construction firms, who feast on cheap </p><p>credit (lending rates are held to only 15 percent per year) </p><p>to build high-rise apartments and office towers, have had to </p><p>stop their projects and thus payment of their day laborers. </p><p>Likewise, many factories and other firms that had been using </p><p>the private banks have been unable to pay their day laborers </p><p>since last Monday the 17th, and are fearing the end of the </p><p>month\'s larger payroll obligations. </p><p> </p><p>The Meek Shall Inherit One Percent a Month, Maybe </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Though wage earners may suffer if the private banks </p><p>are not liquid by week\'s end, many are already under pressure </p><p>due to the nearly simultaneous crash of the 250 billion kyat </p><p>informal financial sector.  An estimated 100,000-200,000 </p><p>depositors, many pensioners or other naive investors who were </p><p>taking advantage of the "too good to be true" rates available </p><p>at these shadow banks (described in Ref E), lost their shirts </p><p>when these nineteen institutions crashed.  There were rumors </p><p>that many of the elite, and several of the private banks, </p><p>were also involved with these informal banks.  However, the </p><p>numbers are not likely high enough for this shady sector\'s </p><p>demise to unhinge society here. </p><p>6. (C) The future is uncertain for the legions of depositors </p><p>caught up in the informal banking crash.  Apparently the GOB </p><p>has seized the assets of the shadow banks and has formed a </p><p>"Liquidation Committee" to sell off the properties and </p><p>ostensibly use the proceeds to repay depositors.  However, </p><p>there has been no public announcement of the Committee\'s </p><p>exact intentions or any timeline.  One or two of the larger </p><p>informal banks have also announced that they would continue </p><p>to add interest (at one percent a month) to their depositors </p><p>accounts, for a lump payout sometime in late 2003 or early </p><p>2004.  None of the bankers or businessmen with whom we spoke </p><p>believes this tale, however. </p><p>1987 Revisited? </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The jury is still out on who will be hit hardest by </p><p>the latest economic fiasco.  Many businessmen now are </p><p>effectively whistling past the graveyard, but, with the GOB </p><p>talking about liquidation proceedings for the real assets </p><p>accumulated by the informal financial institutions, the </p><p>prospects for any further speculative gains on real property </p><p>has to be limited.  The private banking crisis might also </p><p>feed some agitation if workers miss their monthly pay, and </p><p>day laborers go into their second week without wages. </p><p>However, widespread unrest still seems unlikely for three </p><p>reasons. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) First, people are more diversified than they were </p><p>during the demonetization of 1987 but, more importantly, the </p><p>demonetization of 1987 destroyed the value of the most </p><p>commonly held financial asset in Burma -- the kyat.  In </p><p>contrast, this 2003 crisis has actively boosted demand for </p><p>and the value of kyat, as individuals have built up </p><p>precautionary and transactions balances in their homes.  The </p><p>government\'s rescue plan hinges on extending collateralized </p><p>loans to the troubled private banks.  If banks repay these </p><p>loans, and the government retires the money when it\'s </p><p>returned, the long term impact of the crisis may ease </p><p>inflation and stabilize the kyat primarily through the </p><p>destruction of the uncontrolled credit creation system run by </p><p>the informal banking institutions.  These played a larger </p><p>role than initially suspected in the country\'s recent lurches </p><p>toward hyper-inflation and the sharp depreciation of the </p><p>kyat.  In short, people may have difficulty gathering access </p><p>to their deposits now, but there is hope that the kyat they </p><p>do get will have more lasting value, or at least will </p><p>depreciate more slowly than in recent years. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Secondly, who can complain about losing money in </p><p>blatantly illegal Ponzi schemes (which is effectively what </p><p>the informal financial institutions were)?  The GOB could </p><p>have acted sooner, and more methodically, to curb the </p><p>speculation through these companies, but investors knew they </p><p>were taking awful risks in hopes of awesome gains. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Finally, the Burmese people are patient.  Despite one </p><p>or two rock-throwing incidents, as the crisis unfolded on </p><p>February 17 and 18 most customers dispersed peacefully with </p><p>nothing but assurances from their bankers that at least some </p><p>money would be available if they came back "next week."  For </p><p>the average Burmese bank customer, so far, that has been </p><p>enough. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
