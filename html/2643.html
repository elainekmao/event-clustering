<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001393 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2012 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01393  01 OF 02  191241Z </p><p>TAGS: AL, ENRG, IT, PHUM, PREF, ENRG, IT, PHUM, PREF, PREL, PRELAL </p><p>SUBJECT: ALBANIAN PM MAJKO\'S MEETING WITH PM BERLUSCONI: </p><p>ENERGY; TOURISM MAIN POINTS OF DISCUSSION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN. </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ON MARCH 12, ALBANIAN AMBASSADOR TO ITALY </p><p>PELLUMB XHUFI GAVE POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR TOM </p><p>COUNTRYMAN AND POLOFF JIM DONEGAN A READOUT ON ALBANIAN PRIME </p><p>MINISTER PANDELI MAJKO\'S MARCH 6 MEETING IN ROME WITH PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI.  ACCORDING TO XHUFI, THE MEETINGS FOCUSED ON TWO </p><p>ISSUES:  ITALY\'S COMMITMENT TO HELP ALBANIA TO SOLVE ITS </p><p>CONTINUING ENERGY CRISIS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALBANIAN </p><p>TOURISM SECTOR.  THE ITALIAN MFA CONFIRMED THAT A TEAM FROM </p><p>THE ITALIAN ELECTRICITY COMPANY ENEL WOULD VISIT ALBANIA </p><p>DURING THE WEEK OF MARCH 25. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ACCORDING TO XHUFI, AN INDICATION OF HOW IMPORTANT </p><p>ITALY IS TO ALBANIA\'S FOREIGN RELATIONS IS THE FACT THAT THIS </p><p>WAS MAJKO\'S FIRST OFFICIAL FOREIGN VISIT SINCE TAKING OFFICE. </p><p> THE PMS DISCUSSED ALBANIA\'S CONTINUING SERIOUS ELECTRICITY </p><p>GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS.  BERLUSCONI PROMISED </p><p>ITALIAN ASSISTANCE FOR THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.  FIRST, A </p><p>TEAM FROM ENEL (ENTE NAZIONALE PER L\'ENERGIA ELETTRICA) WOULD </p><p>VISIT ALBANIA DURING THE WEEK OF MARCH 25 TO DETERMINE HOW TO </p><p>PROVIDE RELIEF FOR THE COMING MONTHS.  THIS WOULD BE FOLLOWED </p><p>UP WITH MORE ASSISTANCE DESIGNED TO SOLVE THE ENERGY </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM IN ALBANIA FOR THE LONG TERM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) XHUFI SAID THAT BERLUSCONI HAD ALSO PROMISED ITALIAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01393  01 OF 02  191241Z </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR ALBANIA\'S NASCENT TOURISM INDUSTRY.  FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, BERLUSCONI PROMISED TO TALK TO HIS CONTACTS IN THE </p><p>MEDIA INDUSTRY REGARDING TELEVISION AND PRINT ADVERTISING </p><p>CAMPAIGNS TO MAKE ITALIANS MORE AWARE OF THE TOURISM </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES IN ALBANIA.  BERLUSCONI EVEN PROMISED TO VISIT </p><p>(NON-OFFICIALLY) ALBANIA HIMSELF TO HELP PROVIDE SOME </p><p>PUBLICITY FOR THE CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  XHUFI COMMENTED THAT MORE INVESTMENT, IN GENERAL, </p><p>WAS NEEDED FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LIKE ITALY IN ORDER TO </p><p>HELP STABILIZE THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION IN </p><p>ALBANIA.  FOR INSTANCE THERE IS ONLY "ONE-HALF OF AN ITALIAN </p><p>BANK" (THE ITALO-ALBANIAN BANK) IN TIRANA, WHICH CANNOT </p><p>SUPPORT MAJOR ITALIAN INVESTMENT.  IN COMPARISON, THERE ARE 5 </p><p>MAJOR GREEK BANKS PROVIDING SUPPORT TO INVESTORS FROM GREECE. </p><p> ITALY ALSO NEEDS TO BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>PRIVATIZATION PROCESS IN ALBANIA.  HE SAID THAT BERLUSCONI </p><p>HAD PROMISED MAJKO THAT HE WOULD URGE SOME OF HIS CONTACTS IN </p><p>THE TELECOM SECTOR TO GIVE A CLOSE LOOK TO ALBANIA, BUT MAJKO </p><p>REALIZES THAT ITALIANS WILL BE CAUTIOUS, GIVEN THAT SOME </p><p>OTHER INVESTMENTS BY ITALIAN COMPANIES IN THE TELECOM SECTOR </p><p>IN OTHER REGIONS HAD FAILED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  XHUFI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT OBSTACLE </p><p>TO INVESTMENT IN ALBANIA WAS ENERGY, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY </p><p>CONCERN AMONG INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS OVER TAXATION AND </p><p>CORRUPTION ISSUES.  ALBANIA WAS WORKING HARD TO IMPROVE IN </p><p>THESE AREAS.  HE CITED THE EU ACCESSION AND WTO PROCESSES AS </p><p>DRIVERS FOR THIS IMPROVEMENT, AND NOTED THE FREE TRADE ZONES </p><p>WITH MACEDONIA AND CROATIA AS SIGNS OF PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01393  01 OF 02  191241Z </p><p>6.  (C)  XHUFI SAID THAT HE WAS PLEASED WITH THE INCREASED </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN ITALY AND ALBANIA ON TRAFFICKING ISSUES, </p><p>NOTING THAT ALBANIAN ORIGIN HUMAN TRAFFICKING INTO ITALY WAS </p><p>ONE-QUARTER OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR\'S LEVEL.  HE EMPHASIZED THE </p><p>NEED FOR EVEN CLOSER COOPERATION AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT THE REGION IN DEALING WITH </p><p>TRAFFICKING/SMUGGLING ISSUES, PARTICULARLY SINCE MUCH OF THE </p><p>ALBANIA-ITALY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION PROBLEM INVOLVED THIRD </p><p>COUNTRY NATIONALS.  THERE MUST BE A "REGIONAL LEGAL </p><p>FRAMEWORK," AND OTHER COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN FOR TRAFFICKING </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO "ACT RESPONSIBLY."  NOTE: OUR CONVERSATION WITH </p><p>XHUFI TOOK PLACE A FEW DAYS AFTER SIX ALBANIANS HAD DROWNED </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A CLANDESTINE CROSSING OF THE ADRIATIC. </p><p>WE WILL REPORT MORE ON THAT TOPIC SEPTEL.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  DURING A FOLLOW UP TO THIS READOUT, MFA BALKAN </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR MAURIZIO MASSARI CONFIRMED THE ENEL VISIT, </p><p>AND SAID THAT MFA UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE ROBERTO ANTONIONE </p><p>WOULD VISIT ALBANIA APRIL 8-9, WHERE HE WOULD ANNOUNCE A GOI </p><p>ASSISTANCE PACKAGE TO ALBANIA CONSISTING OF 150 MILLION EURO </p><p>FOR DEVELOPMENT SPREAD OVER NEXT 3 YEARS.  MASSARI ALSO </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT BERLUSCONI HAD PROMISED ASSISTANCE WITH THE </p><p>TOURISM SECTOR.  FOR INSTANCE, THE GOI IS INTERESTED IN </p><p>HELPING ALBANIA DEVELOP AS TOURIST SITES A NUMBER OF ROMAN </p><p>RUINS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  MASSARI DOUBTED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE PM WOULD VISIT ALBANIA, OFFICIALLY OR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4988 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01393  02 OF 02  191242Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /014W </p><p>                  ------------------7751B6  191242Z /38 </p><p>P 191159Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 2819 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>USOFFICE PRISTINA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001393 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2012 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01393  02 OF 02  191242Z </p><p>TAGS: AL, ENRG, IT, PHUM, PREF, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: ALBANIAN PM MAJKO\'S MEETING WITH PM BERLUSCONI: </p><p>ENERGY; TOURISM MAIN POINTS OF DISCUSSION </p><p> </p><p>NON-OFFICIALLY, ANY TIME SOON. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  ALBANIA\'S ENERGY PROBLEMS ARE </p><p>LONG-STANDING AND HAVE BECOME A MAJOR FOCUS OF STABILITY PACT </p><p>EFFORTS.  ALTHOUGH THE GOI, STILL THE MAJORITY OWNER OF THE </p><p>SLOWLY PRIVATIZING ENEL, CAN ARRANGE A VISIT TO ALBANIA BY AN </p><p>ENEL TEAM, ENEL IS NOT IN THE FOREIGN AID BUSINESS AND IS </p><p>UNLIKELY TO MAKE A MAJOR INVESTMENT IN IMPOVERISHED ALBANIA. </p><p>THE ASSISTANCE THE ALBANIANS THINK BERLUSCONI PROMISED WILL </p><p>NOT COME FROM ENEL\'S COFFERS.  WHILE THERE MAY BE NOTHING ON </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S CALENDAR INDICATING A VISIT TO ALBANIA, WE WOULD </p><p>NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE HIM MAKE A QUICK TRIP, PARTICULARLY </p><p>IF ONE OF HIS MANY MEDIA CONTACTS ASKED HIM TO LEND HIS </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN TO SELL ALBANIA AS A </p><p>TOURIST DESTINATION TO ITALIANS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.
