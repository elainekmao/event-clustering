<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000769 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  GOVERNMENT AND MAOISTS HOLD FIRST ROUND OF </p><p>PEACE TALKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 0723 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 0692 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  On April 27 Government of Nepal (GON) negotiators </p><p>held the first round of peace talks with their Maoist </p><p>counterparts in a Kathmandu hotel.  During the talks the </p><p>Maoists presented a set of 24 demands that included a </p><p>constituent assembly to draft a new constitution; the </p><p>integration of the Royal Nepal Army with the Maoist People\'s </p><p>Army; an end to foreign military assistance; abrogation of </p><p>the 50-year-old bilateral treaty with India; and repeal of </p><p>anti-terrorism measures.  Implicit in many of the demands was </p><p>either outright abolition of Nepal\'s constitutinal monarchy </p><p>or far stricter limits on his powers.  Negotiators appointed </p><p>a four-person team of facilitators for future dialogue and </p><p>agreed to establish a committee to monitor compliance with </p><p>the code of conduct.  Spokesmen for both sides said they were </p><p>pleased with progress made during this initial round.  The </p><p>date and venue for the next round of talks have not yet been </p><p>decided.  Although many of the Maoist demands clearly exceed </p><p>what the GON is prepared to concede, this first meeting marks </p><p>an important milestone in a still incipient peace process. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>MAOISTS SPELL OUT DEMANDS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On April 27 Government of Nepal (GON) negotiators </p><p>officially opened dialogue with their Maoist counterparts for </p><p>the first time since the January 29 ceasefire announcement. </p><p>(The Maoists had unilaterally called off an earlier first </p><p>session initially scheduled for April 21.)  Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Badri Prasad Mandal led the six-person GON </p><p>delegation (Ref B), while chief ideologue Dr. Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai headed the five-man Maoist team.  After the </p><p>meeting, spokesmen for both sides told the local media that </p><p>they were pleased with the progress achieved during the </p><p>round, which lasted four and a half hours at a Kathmandu </p><p>hotel. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  The Maoists reportedly presented their GON </p><p>interlocutors with a set of 24 demands (considerably pared </p><p>down from the 40-point set first submitted to the </p><p>then-government in 1996).  Salient features of these demands </p><p>(most of which have previously surfaced in Maoist public </p><p>statements over the past months) follow below: </p><p> </p><p>A)  Drafting of a New Constitution </p><p> </p><p>--process begins with an all-party roundtable conference to </p><p>set up an interim government headed by the Maoists; </p><p> </p><p>--the Maoist-led interim government then oversees elections </p><p>to a constituent assembly that drafts a new constitution; </p><p> </p><p>--the new constitution will differ from the current </p><p>constitution in that: </p><p> </p><p>    a) "state power" is entirely vested in the people; </p><p> </p><p>    b) the Maoist People\'s Army is integrated into the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army, which subsequently is placed under the control of </p><p>"the people"; </p><p> </p><p>    c) Nepal is designated a secular state, rather than a </p><p>"Hindu kingdom"; </p><p> </p><p>    d) no part of the new constitution is "unalterable"; any </p><p>part may be changed by referendum; </p><p> </p><p>    e) education, health care and employment will be made </p><p>fundamental rights; </p><p> </p><p>    f) extensive land reforms will be instituted. </p><p> </p><p>B)  Foreign Relations </p><p> </p><p>--all foreign relations should be governed by the principles </p><p>of non-alignment; </p><p> </p><p>--the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the GON and </p><p>India should be abrogated; </p><p>--the open border with India should be controlled and </p><p>regulated; </p><p> </p><p>--foreign military assistance and agreements introduced under </p><p>the guise of combating terrorism that have "a serious impact </p><p>on the national interest" should be ended; </p><p> </p><p>--recruitment (by the Indian and British militaries) of </p><p>Nepalis into Gurkha regiments should end; </p><p> </p><p>--"foreign monopolies" in trade, industry and financial </p><p>services must be abolished; </p><p> </p><p>--interference by foreigners working for NGOs and INGOs must </p><p>stop; </p><p> </p><p>--terms and conditions of foreign loans should be renounced </p><p>if deemed against the national interest; </p><p> </p><p>--the importation of magazines and movies that "pollute" the </p><p>national culture should cease. </p><p> </p><p>C)  Repeal of Anti-terrorism Measures </p><p> </p><p>--existing anti-terrorism legislation should be abolished; </p><p> </p><p>--Maoist Politburo members must be released from detention; </p><p> </p><p>--Royal Nepal Army soldiers must return to their barracks </p><p>within one week; </p><p> </p><p>--whereabouts of missing Maoist cadres must be disclosed. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>FACILITATORS NAMED; </p><p>MONITORS TO BE NAMED </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Besides the presentation of the Maoist agenda, the </p><p>first round of talks also saw the appointment of a four-man </p><p>team of facilitators.  The Maoists chose lawyer and former </p><p>Nepali Congress MP Dham Nath Dhungana and self-described </p><p>human rights activist Padma Ratna Tuladhar, both of whom </p><p>served as facilitators in the abortive round of negotiations </p><p>in 2001, to represent their interests.  For the GON side, </p><p>septuagenarians Shailendra Upadhyay and Karna Dhoj Adhikary, </p><p>former Foreign Minister and former Chief Secretary during the </p><p>partyless Panchayat era respectively, were appointed.  A </p><p>separate bilateral team to monitor compliance with the code </p><p>of conduct will be named at the next round of talks, GON </p><p>negotiator and Physical Planning Minister Narayan Singh Pun </p><p>told the press.  The date and venue for a second round have </p><p>not yet been determined. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Maoist demands are fairly comprehensive, </p><p>including not only the oft-repeated call for a constituent </p><p>assembly but also a detailed prescription for what that </p><p>as-yet unelected assembly should decide.  That the </p><p>hypothetically freely and fairly elected assembly might </p><p>decide that a new constitution is unnecessary does not appear </p><p>to have entered into the Maoist calculus.  If the Maoists are </p><p>truly calling, as they have so often claimed, for free and </p><p>fair elections to a constituent assembly, it is unclear on </p><p>what basis they demand leadership of the all-party body </p><p>overseeing those elections and how they can dictate the shape </p><p>of the resulting constitution.  Although much of the Maoists\' </p><p>apparent xenophobia appears directly targeted at limiting </p><p>Indian influence, the references to INGO "interference" (a </p><p>swipe at the IFIs) and foreign military assistance under the </p><p>guise of counter-terrorism (a swipe at us, the UK, and India) </p><p>obviously stand out.  While the Maoist agenda presented on </p><p>April 27 never explicitly calls for an end to the monarchy, </p><p>the proposed changes to the Constitution (e.g., the transfer </p><p>of "state power" and control of the Army to "the people"; the </p><p>abolition of the Hindu Kingdom) imply either that aim or the </p><p>application of such stringent limits on royal authority as to </p><p>render it superfluous.  It is unlikely that King Gyanendra </p><p>will agree to such fundamental and drastic changes--nor does </p><p>there appear to be much popular appetite to institute them. </p><p>The Government of India is likely to be equally </p><p>unenthusiastic about the calls to abrogate the 1950 bilateral </p><p>accord and to establish greater border controls.  The newer, </p><p>tighter list of demands has eliminated much of the "soft" </p><p>socio-economic elements of earlier iterations of the Maoist </p><p>agenda, leaving little potential common ground on which the </p><p>two sides might begin substantive dialogue. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
