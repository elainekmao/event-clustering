<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 001336 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, PTER, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESS FREEDOM UNDER NEPAL\'S STATE OF EMERGENCY </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Since the beginning of the State of </p><p>Emergency in Nepal, 123 journalists have been arrested, with </p><p>35 still detained, three tortured, and one reportedly killed. </p><p>Inaccuracy and partisanship in the press have led to </p><p>government mistrust and restrictions on publications.  Press </p><p>reaction has ranged from outrage at the questionable </p><p>circumstances of and motives for the arrests, to  welcome </p><p>acceptance of government restrictions as a means of insuring </p><p>increased accuracy of reporting.  Nepal\'s Maoists also </p><p>restrict the press, as they have threatened journalists with </p><p>death for writing certain kinds of articles.  Currently, the </p><p>press is pushing for increased access to conflict areas and a </p><p>Freedom of Information Bill to help expand press freedoms in </p><p>Nepal. The Embassy will continue to press formore cooperative </p><p>military-press relations.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ARREST OF JOURNALISTS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) As of June 26, 2002, the Informal Sector Service </p><p>Center (INSEC), a Nepali human rights NGO, reports that 123 </p><p>Nepali journalists have been arrested under the Terrorist and </p><p>Destructive Activities Ordinance (TADO).  Of these, 35 are </p><p>still in custody.  (Note: INSEC provides the names and dates </p><p>of arrest and release for all these cases.  End note.)  Three </p><p>journalists, Shankar Khanal of Space Time Daily, Shyam </p><p>Shrestha of Mulyankan, and Bijay Raj Acharya of Srijanashil </p><p>Prakashan, have reported being tortured while in police </p><p>custody. The actual number of journalists tortured is rumored </p><p>to be higher.  Recently, Jana Astha, a left-leaning newspaper </p><p>with a fairly good track record for accuracy, reported that a </p><p>Maoist journalist who was arrested in May, Krishna Sen, was </p><p>killed in custody. (Note: The government has not confirmed </p><p>reports of Sen\'s death.  The Home Ministry says it has no </p><p>information on Sen\'s whereabouts; the Defense Ministry says </p><p>the same.  Prime Minister Deuba told the press June 27 that </p><p>the government will disclose the facts regarding Mr. Sen\'s </p><p>wherabouts at the time of his death in "due time."  The Prime </p><p>Minister assured the Ambassador privately on July 4 that his </p><p>government would initiate an inquiry. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Of those arrested, most were uncharged and can only </p><p>speculate on what led to their detention.  Under TADO anyone </p><p>suspected of terrorist activities may be held for 90 days </p><p>without charge, extendable by 90 more days with Home Ministry </p><p>permission.  The reasons for arrest go beyond pro-Maoist </p><p>publications, which are clearly prohibited, and security </p><p>personnel admit to arresting journalists to pressure them </p><p>into revealing Maoist contacts and other information.  The </p><p>Prime Minister is quoted as saying in a March 6 statement </p><p>that Gopal Budhatoka, editor of Sangher, was arrested for </p><p>"spreading rumors and demoralizing the army."  Colleagues of </p><p>Mr. Budhatoki attribute his arrest to an article he published </p><p>about financial irregularities in helicopter purchases by the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>GOVERNMENT POSITION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Secretary at the Ministry of Information </p><p>reiterated in a private interview on June 3 that the </p><p>curtailment of rights under the emergency is not directed </p><p>against the press, but added that the press cannot publish </p><p>items that favor the Maoists or demoralize the military. </p><p>When asked to elaborate on what qualifies as demoralization, </p><p>he gave an example of a report that RNA personnel committed </p><p>human rights abuses or killed civilians, when reporters had </p><p>not been there to verify the information firsthand. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>CREDIBILITY OF THE PRESS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Nepal\'s press faces a credibility gap because of </p><p>their inaccuracy, history of leniancy in their criticism of </p><p>the Maoists, and political partisanship.  A military source </p><p>said that the military feels reluctant to facilitate </p><p>information gathering by journalists because events are </p><p>frequently misreported.  Journalists also report that before </p><p>the state of emergency, the press seemed to favor the </p><p>Maoists, raising concerns that increased press freedom and </p><p>access to conflict areas will lead to unbalanced criticism of </p><p>the military rather than of the Maoists.  Many newspapers </p><p>also have strong political ties, creating questions about the </p><p>fairness of reporting.  The government argues that </p><p>restrictions on the press are in the interest of preventing </p><p>the spread of untrue and potentially dangerous statements. </p><p>On the other side, the press argues that government oversight </p><p>reduces its credibility in the public eye, as journalists are </p><p>seen as government mouthpieces. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>LEGAL CONCERNS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Journalists and their families have raised concerns </p><p>about the legality of arrests and the "disappearance" of </p><p>arrested journalists.  They have made multiple allegations of </p><p>violations of the law prohibiting the military from </p><p>participating in civilian arrests or interrogation.  This is </p><p>a legally murky area, as TADO requires that the army hand </p><p>over civilians, but not combatants, to the police, and the </p><p>army claims it is arresting suspected Maoists, not </p><p>"civilians."  There have also been complaints of raids of </p><p>press offices by both uniformed and plainclothes police </p><p>without warrants, though this is allowed under TADO.  Finding </p><p>the location of arrested journalists is a major issue, as </p><p>security forces frequently do not disclose the location where </p><p>the arrested person is being held, and generally do not allow </p><p>visits by family members.  There is also the problem of </p><p>determining whether an arrested journalist is being held by </p><p>the police or the army, as both frequently deny any knowledge </p><p>of the whereabouts of arrested persons.  The right to file </p><p>writs of habeas corpus is still guaranteed, however, and many </p><p>colleagues and relatives of those arrested have been making </p><p>use of this right.  The relatives of ten arrested journalists </p><p>filed such a writ earlier this year.  After filing, the </p><p>family members report that they were harassed repeatedly by </p><p>security personnel. A writ of habeas corpus has also been </p><p>filed by the Nepal Press Institute for one of its members, </p><p>and the Supreme Court has ordered that he be found.  To date, </p><p>these journalists have not been produced. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has </p><p>been prominent in its attempts to gain access to information </p><p>about journalists who have been arrested, interrogated, or </p><p>detained.  The NHRC works for accountability in the security </p><p>forces and tries to ensure that actions taken against </p><p>journalists stay within the legal provisions of the state of </p><p>emergency and TADO.  This Commission has made inquiries and </p><p>requested notification within three days of the whereabouts </p><p>of arrested journalists.  An official in the complaint </p><p>division reports, however, that it has experienced extreme </p><p>difficulties in its work as the government is very </p><p>uncooperative in responding to its inquiries. The "response </p><p>is always that they haven\'t arrested anybody." Despite these </p><p>difficulties, as a constitutional body the NHRC is the most </p><p>powerful force in Nepal in the monitoring of treatment of </p><p>journalists. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>MAOISTS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The Press is restricted by the Maoists as well. </p><p>There have been reports from all over the country that </p><p>newspapers have been warned against "collaborating with the </p><p>government" by printing articles on certain subjects.  As of </p><p>now, however, only one serious incident has been reported. </p><p>Demling Lama, a correspondent of Radio Nepal, was abducted by </p><p>Maoists and held for 36 hours, because, he believes, of an </p><p>article that he wrote about their activities.  While </p><p>torturing him, they told him that they were planning to kill </p><p>other journalists in the country.  Mr. Lama managed to </p><p>escape, fearing for his life. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>PRESS REACTION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) In conversation with five journalists, all stated </p><p>that self-censorship is practiced by everyone in the media in </p><p>the form of avoiding materials that may violate the 16 </p><p>directives for the press (See para 12) or lead to </p><p>repercussions by law enforcement agencies.  A member of INSEC </p><p>complained that the press does not publish reports of human </p><p>rights abuses because they are "totally self-censored." </p><p>Taranath Dahal of the Federation of Nepali Journalists stated </p><p>"we have become suspects," and described an atmosphere of </p><p>fear and demoralization created by the arrests and </p><p>intimidation of journalists around Nepal. The National Human </p><p>Rights Commission also reports a situation of intense fear. </p><p>An official at the Commission stated that he has received </p><p>from journalists many reports of torture by police, but "most </p><p>people request us not to report these because they are so </p><p>scared...those people could be arrested again tomorrow." </p><p>When asked if he thinks the press is afraid to print the full </p><p>news, he gave an example of an occasion near Nepalgunj where </p><p>members of the NHRC were led by journalists to four bodies, </p><p>presumably shot by the RNA.  When the members asked the </p><p>journalists why they had not reported the incident, the </p><p>journalists responded that they were afraid of retribution </p><p>from the military. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) In contrast, Krishna Timilsina, Executive Director </p><p>of the Nepal Press Institute (NPI), stated that he believes </p><p>the censorship measures taken by the government are </p><p>necessary, explaining that "In this abnormal situation no one </p><p>can expect the freedoms guaranteed constitutionally...In war </p><p>we have to observe some special rules and regulations and </p><p>abide by the legal provisions."  He also considered it a </p><p>matter of ethics not to criticise the military or the </p><p>monarchy, and supported the directive against publishing </p><p>articles that may be demoralizing to the military.  He </p><p>explained that the NPI practices rigorous self-censorship, </p><p>and as a result has not experienced government interference. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The political leanings of the press have been an </p><p>issue since the beginning of the state of emergency.  In the </p><p>five years preceding the emergency, leading journalists say </p><p>that the majority of the press seemed to sympathize with the </p><p>Maoists to some extent.  When the state of emergency was </p><p>declared, however, the publication of Maoist press releases </p><p>came to an immediate end and the press "surrendered" to </p><p>government directives.  Media groups, they say, have been </p><p>eager to prove their patriotism by denouncing the Maoists and </p><p>practicing a self-censorship that in some cases goes beyond </p><p>the restrictions placed on them. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PRESS UNDER EMERGENCY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Several Articles and Sections of the Nepali </p><p>Constitution were suspended by the State of Emergency imposed </p><p>on November 26, 2001 and the Terrorist and Destructive </p><p>Activities Ordinance (TADO).  Two of these have direct </p><p>bearing on the press.  These are Article 12.2, which </p><p>guarantees freedom of movement throughout the kingdom, and </p><p>Article 13, guaranteeing press and publication rights and </p><p>protection against censorship.  Also suspended are Article 15 </p><p>against preventive detention and Article 16 guaranteeing the </p><p>right to information.  Two days after the declaration of </p><p>emergency, a set of 16 directives was issued to the press by </p><p>the Ministry of Information and Communication detailing what </p><p>information it considered fit to broadcast or publish.  Among </p><p>the categories proscribed as not fit to publish are news </p><p>items hurting or shocking civilians, their faith, morality </p><p>and social norms; any item weakening multi-party democracy; </p><p>and any report insulting, humiliating, or shocking the army, </p><p>police, or civil servants.  At the same time the press was </p><p>encouraged to publish the heroic deeds of the RNA as well as </p><p>verified news from the Ministry of Defense. The press has </p><p>largely followed these directives for a variety of reasons, </p><p>including patriotism and fear. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ACCESS TO INFORMATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Two current hot issues in the Nepali press freedom </p><p>debate both relate to access to information.  The first is </p><p>the issue of media access to conflict areas and the right to </p><p>independent verification.  At a seminar on June 5, a </p><p>representative of the RNA expressed the view that the </p><p>military is not interested in facilitating media access to </p><p>the field because security forces need to focus on their </p><p>primary objective of fighting the war, and could not </p><p>guarantee the safety of the journalists.  He also reiterated </p><p>concern that the journalists would publish false information </p><p>that is damaging to the military.  Journalists responded that </p><p>they were willing to accept the risk and burden of being in a </p><p>conflict zone, but they needed permission to travel to those </p><p>areas as well as increased military cooperation in providing </p><p>them with information to help ensure that they are able to </p><p>report accurately.  Some progress was made on setting up a </p><p>meeting between media and military leaders to discuss this </p><p>issue further. The Embassy has encouraged greater involvement </p><p>of the press in conflict areas as a mutually beneficial </p><p>action, and the military has, on a few occasions, taken </p><p>members of the press to the field. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) The second high-profile issue regarding access to </p><p>information is a proposed Right to Information Bill, to take </p><p>effect after the State of Emergency.  The right to </p><p>information is guaranteed in the presently suspended Article </p><p>16 of the Nepali Constitution, but the draft Bill defines who </p><p>will have this access, and specifies the kinds of information </p><p>included.  Section 8 of the Bill requires the provision of </p><p>information regarding unlawful activities perpetrated by a </p><p>public official, and Section 14 defines the mechanism for </p><p>redress.  The Bill was proposed jointly by the Nepal Press </p><p>Institute and the Federation of Nepali Journalists in 2001, </p><p>and the Secretary at the Ministry of Information announced </p><p>plans to introduce it in this year,s Parliamentary summer </p><p>session.  With the dissolution of the Parliament, </p><p>consideration of the Bill has been postponed. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.   COMMENT:  Clearly, The Maoist insurrection and the </p><p>Government\'s counter-insurgency campaign have taken a serious </p><p>toll on press freedom in Nepal.  Contributing to this problem </p><p>have been the low professionalism of elements of the press, </p><p>the expressed sympathy ofsome journalists for the Maoists </p><p>before the declaration of the state of emergency, and the </p><p>deeply ingrained habits of non-transparency of the RNA.  The </p><p>Embassy has been working to encourage greater press freedom </p><p>in Nepal, arguing that the detention of journalists for the </p><p>purpose of intimidation is counterproductive in the fight </p><p>against Maoist terrorism and risks giving Nepal a bad human </p><p>rights reputation that could become an obstacle to continued </p><p>international assistance.  The Ambassador plans to raise this </p><p>issue again with the Prime Minister during their next </p><p>meeting.  US training now being planned for the RNA will </p><p>include discussion on more cooperative military-press </p><p>relations.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
