<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 000908 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UNSC, OIC, NAM, AL, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: SECRETARY\'S ORAL MESSAGE ON IRAQ </p><p>ISSUES AND NAM DEMARCHE DELIVERED </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 47832 </p><p> </p><p>      B) STATE 47493 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador delivered Ref A oral message </p><p>from the Secretary and Ref B NAM demarche on Iraq to </p><p>MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayid AL-Nahyan on </p><p>2/22.  Noting the upcoming Arab League, Islamic </p><p>Conference and NAM summits, the Ambassador </p><p>underscored the need to keep Iraq focused on full </p><p>compliance with UNSCR 1441.  Hamdan assured that the </p><p>UAE would stand firm, but predicted that other </p><p>countries, particularly Syria, may seek statements </p><p>critical of the U.S.  Syria\'s strong-arm tactics at </p><p>what Hamdan termed as last week\'s "disastrous" Arab </p><p>League ministerial in Cairo, had not been well- </p><p>received in many Arab capitals. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hamdan briefed that visiting PLO Secretary </p><p>General and Arafat Deputy Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) </p><p>understood from his recent visit to Moscow that the </p><p>Russians were "98 percent" resigned to the fact that </p><p>the USG would move militarily against Iraq.  In Abu </p><p>Mazen\'s view, the Russians would not prevent the </p><p>attack (i.e. exercise their UNSC veto option). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Hamdan, Fujairah Ruler Hamad Al- </p><p>Sharqi will represent the UAE at the NAM summit </p><p>while Dubai Ruler and UAE Vice President/Prime </p><p>Minister Shaykh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum will </p><p>head up the delegation to the proposed March 1 Arab </p><p>League summit. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
