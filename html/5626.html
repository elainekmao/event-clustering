<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000876 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SPECIAL MEDIA REACTION ON SECRETARY POWELL\'S </p><p>U.N. AND SENATE SPEECHES </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers published on February 7 </p><p>highlight Secretary Powell\'s remarks to the Senate </p><p>Foreign Relations Committee regarding the possibility </p><p>of war in Iraq, and contrast those remarks negatively </p><p>with his earlier presentation before the UN Security </p><p>Council.  Articles focus on the Secretary\'s remarks, </p><p>as quoted in wire service reports, that success in </p><p>overthrowing Saddam Hussein "could fundamentally </p><p>reshape that region in a powerful and positive way </p><p>that will enhance U.S. interests" and that, in the </p><p>event of such an occurrence, the United States would </p><p>be "able to achieve progress on Middle East peace". </p><p>Most commentaries argue that, at the United Nations, </p><p>the Secretary tried to portray the United States as </p><p>the "savior" of the Iraqi people and Iraqi human </p><p>rights and democracy, while, at the Senate, the </p><p>Secretary spelled out the "real reasons" behind the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>U.S. war on Iraq, namely to "reshape the region" in a </p><p>manner that "will enhance U.S. interests". </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The objective of the aggression by Powell\'s own </p><p>admission: fundamental reshaping and Arab surrender" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist George Haddad writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(02/08):  "It is normal for Secretary Powell\'s speech </p><p>to the United Nations and to the world to be different </p><p>from his speech to the U.S. Senate.  At the United </p><p>Nations, Powell still needs, in order to promote his </p><p>justifications and pretexts, the spice of the media </p><p>and the skill of fabrication and falsification.  In </p><p>Congress, however, Powell has to give up the spice and </p><p>the skill, and must resort to frankness and truth to </p><p>explain the real reason for launching the aggression </p><p>on Iraq.  At the Security Council, Powell was </p><p>concerned for the safety of humanity and wanted to </p><p>salvage it from terrorism.  In other words, he wore </p><p>the mask of savior who volunteers to salvage the </p><p>people of the world from Iraqi terrorism.  In </p><p>Congress, on the other hand, Powell had to `spit it </p><p>out\' and confess that ousting Saddam Hussein could </p><p>reshape the Middle East in a manner that strengthens </p><p>the interests of the United States and help end the </p><p>Arab-Israeli conflict." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Powell reveals the real objectives of the American </p><p>scheme" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Mazen Saket writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(02/08):  "Powell, after his speech at the Security </p><p>Council, where he tried to push the international </p><p>community to give the green light for an American </p><p>aggression against Iraq in the name of disarmament and </p><p>Iraq\'s non-compliance on inspections, went back to the </p><p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee to present the real </p><p>American motives and objectives for launching the war </p><p>and aggression on Iraq.  He said that the war will </p><p>fundamentally reshape the region in a positive manner </p><p>that will strengthen U.S. interests and will achieve </p><p>progress towards `peace\' in the Middle East.  After </p><p>this clarification, every other pronounced </p><p>justification about Iraq\'s lack of cooperation, </p><p>Security Council resolutions, Iraqi democracy, and the </p><p>occupation of Kuwait becomes null and void.  The issue </p><p>is clear: an American declaration to place the entire </p><p>region under direct hegemony and control and reshaping </p><p>it by way of a 21st century-style Sikes-Picot." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Reshaping the Middle East" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Kamal Rasheed writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(02/09):  "With Powell\'s remarks, the hidden agenda is </p><p>now exposed and the objective of all this military </p><p>campaign against the Middle East is clear.  The </p><p>remarks mean that exiting countries will fall and be </p><p>replaced, and may be divided up and distributed or </p><p>merged with others.  Yes, it is a process of exploding </p><p>the existing political map of the region.  The </p><p>standard of this reshaping will not consider friends </p><p>or enemies, only American interests in the region, the </p><p>first of which is the State of Israel, its survival, </p><p>superiority, security and hegemony.  The countries </p><p>threatened by this are all the Arab and Muslim </p><p>countries, friends or not of the United States.  No </p><p>country will be spared, big or small.  They will all </p><p>face the American hammer." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The selected slavery" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Kathem Miqdadi writes on the independent, </p><p>mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm (02/09): </p><p>"Colin Powell said it, bluntly and clearly, before </p><p>Congress, that overthrowing the regime of Saddam </p><p>Hussein will `reshape" the Middle East to become more </p><p>responsive to U.S. interests.  Not a single Arab </p><p>official remarked on these dangerous remarks.  Please </p><p>note that the term `reshape\' is dangerous and very </p><p>fluid.  It includes the reshaping of countries, </p><p>governments, organizations, property, agreements, </p><p>regimes and policies.  Before this scary reality and </p><p>before this new American act of arrogance, Arabs </p><p>continue to look for a date for their summit meeting." </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
