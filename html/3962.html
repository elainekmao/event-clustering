<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002857 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMATT: DTHOMPSON </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, EPET, EINV, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY ADVOCACY FOR AES AS THE DECISION ON THE 210 </p><p>MW CONTRACT APPROACHES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  a) 01 TEGUCIGALPA 2872, b) TEGUCIGALPA 02207 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Embassy continues to advocate strongly for a </p><p>transparent process that will treat American investors </p><p>fairly, as the state electricity company ENEE\'s decision on </p><p>the winner of the 210MW electricity tender approaches. </p><p>ENEE\'s decision, like the bid opening itself (ref b), has </p><p>been postponed several times.  It now appears that the </p><p>announcement may occur by October 14.  Rumors continue to </p><p>swirl of corruption and political intrigue.  High level GOH </p><p>officials were surprised by the unexpectedly low prices bid </p><p>by the domestic companies.  AES is the only U.S. firm to bid </p><p>on the project; if AES wins the bid, this power contract </p><p>will allow it to proceed with financing and construction of </p><p>its LNG-fuel combined-cycle El Faro project.  With its usd </p><p>650 million investment, its low cost per kilowatt hour and </p><p>its benefits for regional integration, the project would be </p><p>a boon to Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In response to advocacy requests by AES throughout </p><p>the summer and fall, Emboffs have taken all available </p><p>opportunities to demonstrate USG interest in the fairness of </p><p>the process.  On Monday, October 7, then-Charg d\'Affaires, </p><p>Roger Pierce spoke with Luis Cosenza, Minister of the </p><p>Presidency, to raise the issue of the energy bid and </p><p>emphasize the importance of a fair and transparent process. </p><p>A followup conversation is planned for October 11. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Econcouns reinforced this message with Presidential </p><p>Advisor Ramon Medina Luna on October 7, and with Investment </p><p>Minister, Camilo Atala, on October 10.  She emphasized the </p><p>importance of the project as an indication of Honduras\' </p><p>ability to attract sizable foreign investment.  She flagged </p><p>the possible timing problem of an announcement occurring </p><p>after the President, Luis Cosenza, Camilo Atala and other </p><p>high level officials leave the country for a trip to Europe </p><p>and Asia (providing more opportunity for undue pressure). </p><p>Atala indicated that the GOH intends to have the </p><p>announcement occur before President Maduro\'s departure for </p><p>Europe on October 15 for that very reason.  Finally, she </p><p>asked if it were possible that a firm that did not comply </p><p>with all the tender requirements could be declared winner (a </p><p>veiled but clear reference to the rumor that is circulating </p><p>that AES\'s closest competitor, Lufusa, omitted from its </p><p>offer a commitment to build a usd 20 million transmission </p><p>facility).  Atala acknowledged familiarity with this issue </p><p>and responded that such a firm would be disqualified. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Also on October 10, Emboff was in contact with the </p><p>Commerce Department advocacy center and AES local </p><p>representative, Carlos Pineda, to confirm appropriate </p><p>wording for a possible advocacy letter for AES to be sent to </p><p>President Maduro from Commerce Secretary Evans.  The letter </p><p>emphasizes the proposed AES plant would be a regional power </p><p>facility, supplying power to Honduras, El Salvador, </p><p>Guatemala and elsewhere.  It cites the benefits in terms of </p><p>job creation, lower cost of electricity, and the </p><p>introduction of an environment friendly fuel, liquid natural </p><p>gas.  The letter continues on to request that the bid </p><p>process be followed strictly, that all participants have a </p><p>level playing field and that there be maximum transparency. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Background:  Since the bid opening, there has been </p><p>a raging war in the press between the two most competitive </p><p>bidders, AES and the Honduran firm Lufusa (ref b).  As the </p><p>contest entered the endgame, there have been increased </p><p>rumors and allegations of Honduran firms offering bribes. </p><p>The lack of a disqualification of Lufusa, because of its </p><p>failure to include the cost of building a new substation and </p><p>associated transmission lines, worried local AES reps that </p><p>the intrigue might be yielding fruit.  Embassy strategy has </p><p>been to ensure that the GOH is fully aware that the USG is </p><p>watching the process closely and aware of the details. </p><p>Opponents of the AES project have also advocated </p><p>disqualification of the U.S. company because of financial </p><p>setbacks of its parent company. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Embassy will continue to engage high-level GOH </p><p>officials on the importance of the transparency and fairness </p><p>of the tender process, fair treatment of U.S. investors such </p><p>as AES, and the benefits of the El Faro project. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
