<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001202 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB, NEA/NGA AND EB/CBA, </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC/ONE (CHERIE LOUSTAUNAU AND CARL OBERG) </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USTR FOR DOUG BELL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, YM, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: MIDDLE EAST TRADE INITIATIVE: YEMEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) SECSTATE 135263 B) TUNIS 1273 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: By DCM Alan G. Misenheimer for 1.5 (b.) and (d.) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Summary: The ROYG will respond very positively to the </p><p>Middle East Trade Initiative.  Yemen should accede to the </p><p>World Trade Organization in five years and that process </p><p>should help reinvigorate efforts to conclude a Bilateral </p><p>Investment Treaty.  Sub regional FTAs could have wide </p><p>benefits for Yemen; GCC membership for example is a top </p><p>economic policy objective for Yemen  To qualify, Yemen will </p><p>need technical assistance in WTO accession, privatization, </p><p>regulatory enforcement and public relations. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Middle East Trade Initiative will be welcomed by </p><p>the ROYG as an excellent avenue to develop business </p><p>infrastructure and investment climate as a means to raise </p><p>Yemen\'s standard of living and institutionalize economic </p><p>reform. Several contacts in business and government sectors </p><p>are seeking USG assistance in meeting WTO accession </p><p>requirements and expansion of USG investment in Yemen. The </p><p>Middle East Trade Initiative will also compliment USAID and </p><p>MEPI assistance projects. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>WTO Accession: Four to Five Years </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In October 2002, Yemen submitted its Memorandum of </p><p>Foreign Trade Regime to the World Trade Organization. </p><p>Accession for Yemen is still four to five years away; Yemen </p><p>is currently working hard to answer questions from the </p><p>European Union, the United States and Australia.  The EU has </p><p>pledged 7 million Euros to help Yemen accede, and the Dutch </p><p>and World Bank plan on holding Yemen\'s Integrated Framework </p><p>Conference in June. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We believe this initiative will also reinvigorate our </p><p>efforts to conclude a bilateral Investment Treaty that we </p><p>have been working on with the Ministry of Finance for the </p><p>past year.  Progress has stalled as Yemen works on meeting </p><p>the USG\'s core text requirements. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Subregional FTAs: Bridging the Gap </p><p>between Yemen and other Gulf Countries </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Subregional FTAs would be beneficial for Yemen, </p><p>especially if Yemen gains admission to the Gulf Cooperation </p><p>Council. However, we note Embassy Tunis\' (Reftel B) concerns </p><p>that intra-region politics may hamper the development of </p><p>subregional free trade agreements.  Our  contacts have told </p><p>us that Gulf countries compete with each other in similar </p><p>economic sectors, such as oil and transshipment business, the </p><p>two core aspects of the Yemeni trade economy.  To counteract </p><p>such competition, we suggest that the Middle East Trade </p><p>Initiative encourage the development of complimentary sectors </p><p>in subregional countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Investment Climate: Micro-Enterprise </p><p>and Export Industry Development </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Post is already engaged in developing </p><p>Micro-Enterprise projects and expanding business related </p><p>education as part of our MEPI strategy. Expansion of export </p><p>tied financing programs could help USG firms do business in </p><p>Yemen. Yemenia Airlines representatives told Pol/econoff that </p><p>they prefer to buy Boeing planes, however loan terms offered </p><p>by Airbus were too good to pass up and therefore they placed </p><p>their last order with Airbus. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Technical Assistance: WTO Accession, </p><p>Privatization, and Public Relations </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  The following are possible areas for technical </p><p>assistance: </p><p> </p><p>-- WTO Accession (A): Fortifying Yemen\'s copyright protection </p><p>enforcement is one area that where USG technical assistance </p><p>would aid Yemen.  Post does not assess intellectual copyright </p><p>issues to be a major problem for Yemen, but developing a </p><p>sound legal structure would greatly assist the accession </p><p>process. Any help that we can provide to ensure that future </p><p>IPR problems do not occur will encourage both trade and </p><p>investment in Yemen. </p><p>-- WTO Accession (B): Export industries should be made aware </p><p>of the benefits of WTO status: a technical assistance program </p><p>for exporters to meet quality control  and world trade </p><p>organization standards for their goods would provide </p><p>significant future dividends for domestic industry. </p><p> </p><p>-- Privatization: Assistance programs to encourage ROYG </p><p>efforts to privatize the banking industry and national gas </p><p>companies would help diversify the economy. </p><p>-- Public Relations: Our contacts at the General Investment </p><p>Authority and at the Ministry of International Cooperation </p><p>are eager for Public Relations assistance that would promote </p><p>Yemen\'s tourism, industry and trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Comment: Foreign Direct Investment a Key to Yemen\'s Future </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: Foreign direct investment is an imperative </p><p>for Yemen, which could eventually lose as much as one-third </p><p>of its GDP as oil incomes decline in the next twenty years </p><p>and its twenty plus million population is increasing at a </p><p>rate of 3.7% a year. Free trade agreements are crucial to </p><p>encouraging direct investment, and will be a valuable asset </p><p>in our encouragement and assistance to help Yemen diversify </p><p>its economy. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
