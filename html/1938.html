<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002225 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR JETER </p><p>ACCRA FOR INS </p><p>ROME FOR INS DISTRICT DIRECTOR, GREGORY SMITH </p><p>DAKAR FOR FAA </p><p>DOT FOR KEVIN SAMPLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, CVIS, KFRD, SMIG, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MISSION VIEWS REGARDING INS ASSISTANCE </p><p>FOR DIRECT FLIGHT TO NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. CUNDIFF/COHEN EMAIL 8/23/01 </p><p>     B. LAGOS 01862 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 02031 </p><p>     D. LAGOS 01844 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified, please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) I want to take this opportunity to re-emphasize the </p><p>Mission\'s support for a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) </p><p>with the GON, which would establish guidelines and a legal </p><p>basis for a USG presence at Murtala Muhammed International </p><p>Airport (MMIA).  At the same time, I also want to encourage </p><p>INS support for an airport-based Special Anti-Fraud Unit </p><p>within the Nigerian Immigration Service. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In an e-mail exchange between State and INS </p><p>Headquarters (Ref A), INS indicated that it would prefer to </p><p>provide assistance to South African Airways, Nigeria Airways, </p><p>and the GON without a MOU.  I would like to stress again that </p><p>the Mission strongly believes that it is in the USG interest </p><p>to have such an agreement with the GON.  This agreement would </p><p>provide the written, formal concurrence of the Nigerian </p><p>government, justifying the noticeable USG presence at MMIA </p><p>and providing guidelines and a legal foundation for its </p><p>activities.  Without such an agreement, the USG could </p><p>potentially face public criticism fueled by the complaints of </p><p>passengers subsequently denied boarding.  By having the GON </p><p>on our side, with the backing of a written agreement, the </p><p>Mission and INS TDYers are much better protected against </p><p>these potential problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) We agree that INS officers conducting passenger </p><p>screening at MMIA should operate in a consultative role as </p><p>much as possible.  However, passengers denied boarding know </p><p>very well that it was a USG official who had advised the </p><p>airline to do so.  Also, INS has indicated that for their </p><p>officers to operate they must have the right to confiscate </p><p>fraudulent U.S. documents.  We agree, and these issues are </p><p>addressed in the proposed MOU (Reftel B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) I greatly appreciate the INS assistance received so </p><p>far--the timely visit of INS District Director Gregory Smith </p><p>was particularly helpful--and the INS offer of continued TDY </p><p>support.  The problems associated with the direct flight have </p><p>the attention of the GON at its highest level, and the GON </p><p>welcomes any assistance that we can provide.  However, we </p><p>must have something in writing, signed by the GON, that </p><p>allows us to carry out such activity.  This will provide us </p><p>with the legal and political cover for our role and </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) I also understand that during Washington discussions </p><p>it was suggested that the USG ask the GON to form a "joint </p><p>task force" to combat the problem of malafide passengers. </p><p>The proposed joint task force would bring together the </p><p>Nigerian Immigration Service and Nigerian Police to arrest </p><p>and prosecute passengers presenting fraudulent documents. </p><p>This proposal causes us some concern.  In practice, the joint </p><p>task force concept is difficult to implement in Nigeria due </p><p>to a real lack of coordination (and at times cooperation) </p><p>among agencies.  In October last year, we tried a similar </p><p>proposal with the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency </p><p>(NDLEA) and the Nigerian Customs Service based on the U.S. </p><p>joint task force model.  We learned that interagency </p><p>cooperation does not work as well as we would like in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) We fear similar problems would be experienced with </p><p>an Immigration/Nigerian Police joint task force proposal. </p><p>The lack of fraudulent document prosecution is not just a </p><p>lack of attention by the Nigerian Police; in fact, it also is </p><p>a larger question of the overall professionalism of the </p><p>police and the efficiency and transparency of the judicial </p><p>system.  Both of these issues are now being addressed by the </p><p>Mission on other, higher-level fronts, and through assistance </p><p>programs to help revive a greatly diminished national </p><p>judicial system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) However, we strongly support the idea of an </p><p>airport-based, Special Anti-fraud Unit within the Nigerian </p><p>Immigration Service (Reftel C).  Such a dedicated effort can </p><p>potentially produce noticeable and significant results, and </p><p>one aspect of this can be to work with Nigerian Immigration </p><p>to see what steps can be taken to facilitate prosecutions in </p><p>the short-term.  Effective prosecution would be reinforced by </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s proposal to establish an airport </p><p>Magistrate\'s Court (Reftel C).  The broader issues of police </p><p>and judicial reform, and interagency cooperation will be more </p><p>appropriately addressed within the context of the proposed </p><p>Bilateral Law Enforcement Commission (Reftel D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) I am concerned that while the USG is evaluating </p><p>these broad issues and seeking long-term solutions, malafide </p><p>passengers continue to arrive on the South African </p><p>Airways/Nigeria Airways direct flight to New York.  This not </p><p>only has a direct impact upon the U.S. port-of-entry, but </p><p>also upon the viability of the direct flight and our </p><p>bilateral relationship with the GON.  We must resolve these </p><p>issues quickly and effectively with a MOU and the presence of </p><p>an INS officer(s) who can assist the GON in forming the </p><p>proposed Anti-fraud Unit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) UPDATE: On September 1, a 30 day TDY INS officer </p><p>arrived at Post to provide assistance to the airlines and the </p><p>GON in combating the malafide passenger problem.  We </p><p>understand that another TDY officer has been identified to </p><p>follow.  I greatly appreciate INS assistance in providing </p><p>this presence, but also feel it is now even more urgent that </p><p>we sign a formal agreement, i.e.- the MOU, with the GON for </p><p>the reasons outlined above.  Your support for these </p><p>initiatives is greatly appreciated. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
