<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 002977 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NP/ECS, NEA/NGA, EUR/PRA, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, ETTC, ETRD, IR, IT, EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S NUANCED POLICY ON DUAL USE EXPORTS TO IRAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02977  181713Z </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 104462 (B) ROME 2257 (C) STATE 64844 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY ECOUNS KAREN MILLIKEN; REASON 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.  ITALY INSISTS ITS POLICY </p><p>PROHIBITING SALES OF WEAPONS AND SENSITIVE DUAL USE ITEMS </p><p>REMAINS FULLY IN FORCE.  HOWEVER, MFA\'S NONPROLIFERATION </p><p>COORDINATOR FLAGS A POTENTIAL LEGAL VULNERABILITY IN THE </p><p>POLICY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE UNITED NATIONS\' FAILURE TO ADOPT </p><p>A RESOLUTION THIS YEAR CRITICAL OF IRAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>RECORD.  MFA ASSURES US THAT NO ITALIAN COMPANIES HAVE </p><p>APPLIED TO EXPORT ITEMS (REF A) THAT COULD AID IRANIAN COVERT </p><p>NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES.  AN INVESTIGATION INTO PROPOSED EXPORTS </p><p>OF SPEED BOATS AND BOAT ENGINES (REF B) CONTINUES.  SEE </p><p>ACTION REQUEST PARA 7.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ITALY HAS LONG EMBARGOED EXPORTS TO IRAN OF ARMS AND </p><p>SENSITIVE DUAL USE ITEMS, MFA\'S NONPROLIFERATION ISSUES </p><p>COORDINATOR UGO DE MOHR REMINDED ECONOFF DURING A JUNE 14 </p><p>MEETING.  HE SAID, THOUGH, THAT THE POLICY COULD BE </p><p>VULNERABLE TO LEGAL CHALLENGE IN THAT IT DERIVES FROM THE </p><p>MANDATE OF ITALIAN PUBLIC LAW 1085 THAT SUCH ITEMS CANNOT BE </p><p>EXPORTED TO ANY NATION TARGETED BY A UN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>RESOLUTION.  THIS YEAR\'S RESOLUTION HAVING FAILED TO PASS </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING EU SUPPORT FOR IT, DE MOHR NOTES THAT THE </p><p>POLICY TECHNICALLY LACKS A LEGAL JUSTIFICATION. ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>EXPECTS NO PUSH FOR A POLICY CHANGE FROM WITHIN THE GOI, HE </p><p>POINTS OUT THAT ITALIAN COMPANIES AGGRIEVED BY DECISIONS </p><p>DENYING LICENSES FOR EXPORTS TO IRAN COULD APPEAL TO ITALIAN </p><p>COURTS, WHICH WOULD BE HARD-PRESSED TO UPHOLD THE DENIAL.  AS </p><p>A PRACTICAL MATTER, HE QUICKLY ADDED, JUDICIAL APPEALS OF GOI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02977  181713Z </p><p>DECISIONS ON EXPORT LICENSES ARE VERY RARE; GENERALLY </p><p>EXPORTERS DON\'T LOOK TO ANTAGONIZE THE LICENSING AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT.  DE MOHR HAS SAID IN THE PAST THAT HE DOES </p><p>NOT AGREE WITH THE ASSERTION (REPEATED REF C) THAT WASSENAAR </p><p>MEMBERS HAVE NECESSARILY COMMITTED TO REFRAIN FROM ARMS SALES </p><p>TO IRAN.  HE BELIEVES THE WASSENAAR LANGUAGE IS INTENTIONALLY </p><p>VAGUE ON POINT, REFLECTING A LACK OF CONSENSUS AMONG EARLY WA </p><p>DELEGATES.  THE UN RESOLUTIONS AGAINST IRAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS </p><p>HAVE FED INTO THE "CATCH HUMAN RIGHTS" PROVISION OF ITALIAN </p><p>PUBLIC LAW 1085 TO GET ITALY TO THE SAME PLACE; I.E., TO </p><p>PROHIBITING ARMAMENT EXPORTS (AS WELL AS SENSITIVE DUAL USE </p><p>EXPORTS) TO IRAN.  ITALY THEREFORE HAS NEVER HAD TO DECIDE </p><p>WHETHER WASSENAAR\'S "COUNTRIES OF CONCERN" REFERENCE </p><p>CONTEMPLATES IRAN AND WHETHER THE REFERENCE HAS ANY LEGAL </p><p>EFFECT UNDER ITALIAN LAW.   END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ON THE IMMEDIATE ISSUE OF THE EXPORT OF ITEMS LISTED </p><p>REF A AS POTENTIALLY DESTINED FOR IRAN\'S COVERT NUCLEAR </p><p>PROGRAM, DE MOHR SAID NO ITALIAN COMPANIES HAVE APPLIED TO </p><p>THE GOI FOR RELEVANT LICENSES.  AS CHAIR OF THE </p><p>INTERMINISTERIAL DUAL USE LICENSING COMMITTEE, HE IS </p><p>CONFIDENT ANY EFFORT TO EXPORT LISTED ITEMS WOULD COME TO HIS </p><p>ATTENTION.  HE SAID HE WOULD SHARE REF A NONPAPER WITH KEY </p><p>COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DE MOHR SAID HE HAS TALKED RECENTLY WITH THE ITALIAN </p><p>COMPANIES LOOKING TO EXPORT BOATS AND BOAT ENGINES TO IRAN </p><p>(FABBIO BUZZI DESIGN AND ISOTTA FRANCHINI) PER REF B.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED HIS IMMEDIATE ROLE AS DECIDING WHETHER THE BOATS </p><p>INVOLVED ARE WARSHIPS.  IF HE CONCLUDES THEY ARE, HE WILL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02977  181713Z </p><p>PASS THE FILE TO THE MFA OFFICE THAT CONSIDERS REQUESTS FOR </p><p>ARMAMENT EXPORTS (UAMA) WHICH, HE IS CERTAIN, WOULD NIX THE </p><p>EXPORT NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABSENCE OF A CURRENT UN RESOLUTION </p><p>CRITICAL OF IRAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ON THE OTHER HAND, IF DE MOHR CONCLUDES THAT THE BOATS </p><p>AND BOAT ENGINES ARE DUAL USE ITEMS, HE WILL BRING THE CASE </p><p>TO INTERMINISTERIAL COMMITTEE TO DECIDE BASED ON AVAILABLE </p><p>EVIDENCE AS TO END USE.  HE ASKED WHETHER THE USG CONSIDERS </p><p>COAST PATROLLING TO BE AN INHERENTLY MILITARY FUNCTION AND </p><p>WHETHER THE U.S. COAST GUARD AND ITALIAN GUARDIA DI FINANZIA </p><p>ARE PURELY MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS.  ECONOFF REPLIED, PER REF </p><p>C, THAT THE DESIGN OF THE HIGH SPEED BOATS AND THE POWER OF </p><p>THE ENGINES UNDER CONSIDERATION ARE MORE CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>OFFENSIVE AND SPECIAL OPERATIONS ACTIVITIES THAN WITH </p><p>CONVENTIONAL PATROLLING. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST.  DE MOHR IS CLEARLY </p><p>STRUGGLING WITH THE PATROL BOAT AND ENGINE CASES.  AS HE </p><p>REVIEWS THE PROPOSED EXPORTS WITH THE INVOLVED ITALIAN </p><p>COMPANIES, HE WILL COME UNDER PRESSURE TO SEE THESE ITEMS AS </p><p>LEGITIMATE ASPECTS OF ITALY\'S ROBUST TRADE WITH IRAN.  IF </p><p>COMPELLING TECHNICAL ARGUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE (E.G., SPEED </p><p>CAPACITY IS EXCESSIVE FOR CONVENTIONAL PATROL BOATS, OTHER </p><p>BOAT DESIGNS ARE MORE APPROPRIATE TO PATROLLING, ETC.), WE </p><p>COULD PUT THEM TO GOOD USE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02977 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
