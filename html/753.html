CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>SREBRENICA UPDATE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE UN REPORTS THAT 26,000 REFUGEES FROM SREBRENICA </p><p>ARE STILL BEING TAKEN CARE OF BY THE DUTCH BATTALION IN </p><p>POTOCARI, HOWEVER, FOOD IS EXPECTED RUN OUT BEFORE THE END </p><p>OF THE DAY.  SEVERAL THOUSAND DRAFT AGE MALES ARE REPORTED </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY BY THE BSA FOR QUESTIONING </p><p>REGARDING WAR CRIMES CHARGES, BUT THE DESTINATION IS </p><p>UNKNOWN (POSSIBLY TO BRATUNAC WHERE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS </p><p>INDICATE THAT 48 DUTCH PEACEKEEPERS ARE STILL REING </p><p>"DETAINED.")  SO FAR, 6,000 DISPLACED PERSONS (DP\'S) HAVE </p><p>BEEN TAKEN TO KLADANJ IN BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT TERRITORY. </p><p>THE BSA IS TAKING REFUGEES BY BUS AS FAR AS 1-2 KILOMETERS </p><p>FROM THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT LINES AND THEN TELLING THEM TO </p><p>WALK THE REST OF THE WAY.  UNHCR WILL MOVE THE GROUP AT </p><p>KLADANJ TO TUZLA, WHERE 4,000 DP\'S ARE LOCATED AT THE </p><p>AIRPORT, IN AN AREA THAT IS STILL SURROUNDED BY MINES. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02615  01 OF 02  131336Z </p><p>ONE GROUP OF 33 WOUNDED REFUGEES WHO WERE UNABLE TO WALK </p><p>TO GOBH LINES TRIED TO TURN BACK TO POTOCARI, BUT WERE </p><p>STOPPED AT A BSA CHECKPOINT AND ARE BEING DENIED ACCESS TO </p><p>MEDICAL CARE.  A UNHCR CONVOY FROM BELGRADE CARRYING FOOD, </p><p>WATER, MEDECINE, AND SANITARY SUPPLIES TO POTOCARI IS </p><p>BEING DETAINED BY THE BSA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SOURCES AT THE UN AND IOM TOLD US THAT BOSNIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE ALSO IMPEDING ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>REFUGEES IN ORDER TO WORSEN THE SITUATION AND FOCUS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.  GOBH MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO </p><p>HASAN MURATOVIC REPORTEDLY TOOK A HARD LINE WITH UNHCR, </p><p>SAYING THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARE OF THE REFUGEES LIES </p><p>SOLELY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  WE WERE TOLD </p><p>THAT GOBH AUTHORITIES ARE BLOCKING UNHCR ATTEMPTS TO MOVE </p><p>DP\'S FROM THE TUZLA AIRPORT INTO 11,000 SPACES IN TOWN AND </p><p>IOM REPORTED THAT 40 INJURED DP\'S WERE TURNED AWAY FROM </p><p>TUZLA HOSPITAL.  UN CONTACTS ALSO ACCUSED THE GOBH OF </p><p>DELAYING AID CONVOYS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AS OF NOON ON JULY 13, GORAZDE AND ZEPA ARE REPORTED </p><p>TO BE CALM.  HOWEVER, THE UN STATED THAT THERE IS LITTLE </p><p>THAT COULD BE DONE TO KEEP THE ZEPA ENCLAVE FROM BEING </p><p>OVERRUN IN CASE OF AN ATTACK.  THERE ARE NO CURRENT PLANS </p><p>TO REINFORCE THE 70 UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS IN THE TOWN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON THE DRAFT UNSC RESOLUTION ON SREBRENICA, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02615  01 OF 02  131336Z </p><p>UN DEPUTY PRESS SPOKESMAN CHRIS GUNNESS SAID THAT </p><p>REESTABLISHMENT OF THE SAFE AREA IS NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN </p><p>AS IT WOULD REQUIRE RECONQUERING THE ENCLAVE.  THE </p><p>SITUATION IN SREBRENICA, HE SAID, SHOWS THAT THE CONCEPT </p><p>OF SAFE AREAS IS UNREALISTIC.  THIS CRISIS IS ANOTHER </p><p>EXAMPLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PURSUING LOFTY </p><p>OBJECTIVES WITHOUT PROVIDING THE UN WITH SUFFICIENT </p><p>RESOURCES TO CARRY THEM OUT.  WHEN ASKED IF UNPROFOR WILL </p><p>PROTECT THE OTHER SAFE AREAS IN CASE OF ATTACK, THE </p><p>SPOKESMAN\'S OFFICE REPLIED THAT UNPROFOR COULD DO THIS </p><p>ONLY IF MEMBER STATES HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL TO PROVIDE </p><p>THE MILITARY RESOURCES.  REFERRING TO A POSSIBLE ROLE FOR </p><p>THE RAPID REACTION FORCE, GUNNESS SAID THAT TROOP </p><p>CONTRIBUTORS STILL HAVE NOT INDICATED HOW THIS FORCE IS TO </p><p>BE USED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>GOC TO STATE ITS POSITION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.

NOBILO STRESSED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT ANY SIMILAR LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE BIHAC POCKET MIGHT CREATE UP TO 60,000 </p><p>REFUGEES AND THUS CONSTITUTE A THREAT TO CROATIA\'S WELL- </p><p>BEING.
