<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECIN, ECON, IT, KSEI, ECIN, ECON, IT, KSEI, PREL, PRELEAID </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY UPBEAT (SORT OF) ON STABILITY PACT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01517  01 OF 02  261113Z </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 38818 (B) 01 ROME 6024 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY A/ECMIN DAVID MULENEX; REASON 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  THE GOI BELIEVES THAT SOUTHEAST EUROPE </p><p>COOPERATIVE PROCESS STATES HAVE VERY RECENTLY BECOME MUCH </p><p>MORE REALISTIC IN EVALUATING THE ORGANIZATION\'S POTENTIAL AND </p><p>THE SEECP, AS A RESULT, IS POISED TO BECOME A MUCH MORE </p><p>EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE FOR REGIONALISM BOTH WITHIN THE STABILITY </p><p>PACT AND OTHERWISE.  ITALY\'S ENCOURAGEMENT, HOWEVER, IS NOT </p><p>LIKELY TO INCLUDE MONEY.  THE ITALIAN CHAIR OF WORKING TABLE </p><p>II IS SIMILARLY ENTHUSED ABOUT SEECP\'S CAPACITY TO TRANSCEND </p><p>THE SPLINTERED ADVOCACY FOR LOCAL PET PROJECTS HE FEELS HAS </p><p>HINDERED STABILITY PACT EFFORTS.  THE GOI BELIEVES STABILITY </p><p>PACT COORDINATOR BUSEK WILL PROVE A GOOD CHOICE IF HE TRIAGES </p><p>SEVERAL OF HIS DISTRACTING OUTSIDE JOBS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE SOUTHEAST EUROPE COOPERATIVE PROCESS (SEECP) HAS </p><p>VERY RECENTLY LOWERED ITS AMBITIONS IN LIGHT OF AVAILABLE </p><p>RESOURCES AND, AS A RESULT, COULD BECOME AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>FACILITATOR OF REGIONAL PROJECTS, MFA STABILITY PACT (SP) </p><p>COORDINATOR ALLESANDRO PIETROMARCHI TOLD POLOFF AND ECONOFF </p><p>ON MARCH 20.  APPLAUDING WHAT HE SEES AS A NEW SEECP REALISM </p><p>AS ALBANIA PREPARES TO HAND THE PRESIDENCY TO YUGOSLAVIA, </p><p>PEITROMARCHI SAID, "IF YOU HAD ASKED ME 20 DAYS AGO, I WOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN PESSIMISTIC; NOW I THINK THINGS ARE COMING ALONG </p><p>FINE."  HE SAID SEECP HAS DROPPED PLANS FOR "GLORIOUS </p><p>STRUCTURES" SUCH AS A POLITICAL DIRECTORS COMMISSION IN FAVOR </p><p>OF MORE REALISTIC GOALS SUCH AS (FINALLY) NAMING A REGIONAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TO SP\'S INFORMAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01517  01 OF 02  261113Z </p><p>3. (SBU) PIETROMARCH SAID ITALY HAS NO "VEHICLE" FOR FUNDING </p><p>EXPENSES FOR A REGIONAL SECONDEE.  REMINDED THAT MFA HAD </p><p>CREATIVELY FOUND SOME MONEY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TO PAY THE </p><p>EXPENSES OF TWO ITALIAN CUSTOMS AGENTS SECONDED TO THE </p><p>SOUTHEAST EUROPE COOPERATIVE INITIATIVE (SECI), HE SAID THAT </p><p>WAS EASIER BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY ON THE GOI PAYROLL AND, </p><p>BESIDES, "WE WANTED TO FIND THAT MONEY."  IN THIS CASE, HE </p><p>SUGGESTED, THE SEECP STATES COULD, AS THEY EVIDENTLY HAVE IN </p><p>THE PAST, SECOND TO THE STABILITY PACT  OFFICIALS ALREADY </p><p>POSTED TO BRUSSELS AND THEREBY AVOID ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) PIETROMARCHI SAID HE HAS NO STRONG FEELINGS EITHER </p><p>WAY ON THE MECHANICS OF SEECP PARTICIPATION IN SP.  HE WOULD </p><p>NOT OPPOSE AN SEECP ROLE IN SELECTING A REPRESENTATIVE TO THE </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE STEERING COMMITTEE OR THE INFORMAL </p><p>CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE IF THE STATES OF THE REGION WANT IT. </p><p>HE DOES NOT THINK SUCH A ROLE WOULD UNDULY LIMIT THE POWERS </p><p>OF SP SPECIAL COORDINATOR ERHARD BUSEK. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) PIETROMARCHI OFFERED A QUALIFIED ENDORSEMENT OF </p><p>BUSEK\'S EARLY PERFORMANCE, SAYING HE TRUSTS BUSEK ("OUR MAN </p><p>IN THE REGION") AND BELIEVES HIM TO HAVE AN IDEAL MIX OF </p><p>COMPETENCE AND EXPERIENCE BUT JUDGES HIM VERY HARSHLY FOR </p><p>WHAT SEEMS TO BE A SCATTERED APPROACH TO SP WORK.  ASKED </p><p>WHETHER HE THOUGHT BUSEK SHOULD CONTINUE TO SPLIT HIS TIME </p><p>BETWEEN SP AND SECI, PIETROMARCHI REPLIED THAT BUSEK ACTUALLY </p><p>HOLDS FIVE JOBS SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THAT THE SITUATION IS </p><p>COMPLETELY UNTENABLE.  PIETROMARCHI CALLED THE BRUSSELS SP </p><p>OFFICE "AWFUL" FROM A BASIC BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE WITH THE </p><p>STAFF INCOMPETENT AND MANAGERIAL OVERSIGHT NONEXISTENT.  HE </p><p>BELIEVES SECI, AT A MINIMUM, SHOULD BE FOLDED INTO SP. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01517  01 OF 02  261113Z </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) STABILITY PACT WORKING TABLE II CHAIR FABRIZZIO </p><p>SACCOMANNI WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENDORSED AN ENHANCED ROLE FOR SEECP </p><p>IN SP.  IN A MARCH 15 MEETING IN HIS BANK OF ITALY OFFICE </p><p>WITH ECOUNS AND ECONOFF, SACCOMANNI ASSURED THAT THE STATES </p><p>OF THE REGION ENDORSE SUCH A ROLE FOR SEECP.  HE ENVISIONED </p><p>IN PARTICULAR SEECP HELPING TO MOVE ITS MEMBER STATES TOWARD </p><p>A REGIONAL ORIENTATION THAT COULD MAKE THE WORKING TABLE </p><p>MEETINGS HE CHAIRS FAR MORE EFFICIENT BY OBVIATING LENGTHY </p><p>INTERVENTIONS BY INDIVIDUAL STATES IN FAVOR OF "COMPETING" </p><p>PET PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) LIKE PIETROMARCHI, SACCOMANNI IS GUARDED IN HIS </p><p>EXPECTATIONS OF THE CAPACITY OF SEECP TO TRANSCEND </p><p>LONG-ESTABLISHED BEHAVIOR PATTERN PERMUTATIONS AMONG ITS </p><p>MEMBER STATES.  ALTHOUGH HE FAVORS SEECP\'S ASCENDANCY, HE </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT THE GROUP\'S PARTICIPATION IN SP\'S </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE STEERING GROUP COULD CLOG UP DELIBERATIONS </p><p>THERE.  HE SAID THE ISC MERITS PRESERVATION BECAUSE IT HAS </p><p>MADE UNWIELDY AND DECREASINGLY EFFECTIVE DONOR CONFERENCES </p><p>UNNECESSARY BY INSTITUTIONALIZING PROJECT REVIEWS BY THE SP </p><p>AND THE FIVE INVOLVED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. </p><p>COMMENT.  THE ISC IS SACCOMANNI\'S BABY, BORN AT A TIME (REF </p><p>B) SP WAS UNDER GREAT PRESSURE BY SOME OF ITS MEMBERS (MOSTLY </p><p>FRANCE) TO GET OUT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS ALTOGETHER. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2967 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01517  02 OF 02  261113Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------7A96A2  261114Z /38 </p><p>P 261027Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 2942 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECIN, ECON, IT, KSEI, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY UPBEAT (SORT OF) ON STABILITY PACT </p><p> </p><p> HE BELIEVES THE ISC HAS LEGITIMIZED SP\'S CONTINUED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01517  02 OF 02  261113Z </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE ROLE, WHICH HE HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED IS HIS </p><p>WORKING TABLE\'S PRIMARY RAISON-D\'ETRE, AND HE CAN BE EXPECTED </p><p>TO FIERCELY RESIST ANY DIMINISHING OF ITS EFFICIENCY EVEN IF </p><p>BROUGHT ABOUT BY SEECP PARTICIPATION. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01517 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
