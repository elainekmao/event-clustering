(C) ACCORDING TO DELLA SETA, IN THE LAST YEARS\' INTERNAL </p><p>EU DEBATE, THE U.K. AND FRANCE, AMONG OTHER NORTHERN-TIER EU </p><p>COUNTRIES, SUPPORTED HARDER-HITTING SANCTIONS AGAINST THE </p><p>REGIME.  GERMANY, AUSTRIA, PORTUGAL, AND ITALY SAW LESS VALUE </p><p>IN SANCTIONS; CONSIDERING THAT ASIAN COUNTRIES AND AUSTRALIA </p><p>HAVE NOT IMPOSED SANCTIONS, AN EU SANCTIONS REGIME IS </p><p>INEFFECTIVE.  EARLIER THIS YEAR THE EU COMPROMISED AND </p><p>DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF A STRICTER REGIME UNTIL OCTOBER. </p><p>THE DELAY ALLOWS FOR A ONE-TIME EU TROIKA (CURRENT EU </p><p>PRESIDENT, FUTURE EU PRESIDENT, AND CFSP HIGH REP) TO VISIT </p><p>RANGOON IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE THE GOB TO EASE </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON THE OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>3.

THE EU </p><p>DELIVERED A DEMARCHE ON JUNE 9, AND PLANS TO ISSUE A JOINT </p><p>DECLARATION IN THE COMING WEEKS.  DELLA SETA ALSO SAID THERE </p><p>IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY THE EU WILL IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>STRONGER SANCTIONS PLANNED FOR OCTOBER.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>    ITALIAN MFA BELIEVES THE GOB IS NOT RESPONSIVE TO THE </p><p>CONCERNS OF THE EU.  THE REAL PLAYERS ARE CHINA, INDIA, </p><p>PAKISTAN, AND THE U.S.  THE GOI WOULD LIKE TO SEE ASEAN </p><p>INCREASE ITS PRESSURE ON THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT, BUT </p><p>RECOGNIZES THE CULTURAL RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF ASEAN </p><p>NATIONS TO "MEDDLE" IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF PARTNER </p><p>COUNTRIES.  DELLA SETA POINTED OUT A JOINT DECLARATION BY </p><p>MALAYSIAN PM MAHATHIR AND JAPANESE PM KOIZUMI, WHICH HE SAID </p><p>WAS CRITICAL OF THE GOB\'S ACTIONS, AS A POSSIBLE POSITIVE </p><p>STEP.  DELLA SETA SAID HE WOULD BE IN TOUCH WITH THE ITALIAN </p><p>EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON TO INSTRUCT THEM TO COORDINATE CLOSELY </p><p>WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: DELLA SETA\'S BRIEF DISCOURSE ON THE HISTORY </p><p>OF EU-BURMA SANCTIONS WAS INTERESTING.  HOWEVER, AS HE SAID, </p><p>ITALY HAS NO CONCRETE INTERESTS (ECONOMIC OR POST-COLONIAL) </p><p>IN BURMA AS DOES FRANCE.  AS THE INCOMING EU PRESIDENT, THE </p><p>GOI IS INTERESTED IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE U.S. TO </p><p>MAXIMIZE PRESSURE ON THE GOB AND LEVERAGE THE EU\'S ADMITTEDLY </p><p>SMALL INFLUENCE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02585 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
