SUMMARY: DPO MET WITH VO VAN CUONG, STANDING DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEE (CPC), </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NOVEMBER 8, ACCOMPANIED BY ECONOFF AND CONOFF.  CUONG </p><p>SAID HCMC HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A "LAB" FOR PARTY </p><p>POLICY FORMULATION, BUT STRESSED THAT FINAL ACTION ON </p><p>"EXPERIMENTS" RESTS WITH THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN </p><p>HANOI.  CUONG SAID HE HOPED THE USG WOULD PLAY A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01316  231000Z </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN LINKING U.S. AND VIETNAMESE </p><p>BUSINESSES AS BOTH SIDES IMPLEMENT THE BTA.  ASKED </p><p>ABOUT CONTROLS ON INTERNET ACCESS, HE STATED THE PARTY </p><p>UNDERSTANDS VIETNAM MUST BE MORE OPEN FOR THE COUNTRY </p><p>TO SUCCEED IN THE GLOBAL MARKET.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. CUONG WELCOMED DPO TO HCMC, AND SAID THAT HCMC HAS </p><p>HISTORICALLY BEEN A "LAB" FOR EXPERIMENTATION ON POLICY </p><p>FORMATION.  HE CITED THREE EXAMPLES ON THE SOCIAL </p><p>FRONT: POVERTY REDUCTION AND HUNGER ELIMINATION, </p><p>"HOUSES OF COMPASSION" AND "HOUSES OF GRATITUDE." </p><p>(NOTE: THE LATTER TWO ARE SOCIAL PROGRAMS PROVIDING </p><p>HOUSING TO POOR FAMILIES AND TO FAMILIES WHO LOST </p><p>MEMBERS DURING THE WAR.)  HE ADDED THAT THE HCMC CPC IS </p><p>CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON A NUMBER OF OTHER SOCIAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, NOTING HE IS IN CHARGE </p><p>OF MONITORING AND IMPLEMENTING ALL PROGRAMS DEVELOPED </p><p>BY THE CPC.  HE CITED PROGRAMS ON STREET CRIME, </p><p>PROSTITUTION, AND DRUG USE AS EXAMPLES.  HE ALSO CITED </p><p>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR THE </p><p>POOR AS EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING </p><p>PROBLEMS CREATED BY HCMC\'S RAPID POPULATION GROWTH. </p><p> </p><p>3. CUONG SAID THAT, ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE, HCMC HAS BEEN </p><p>THE TESTING GROUND FOR MANY PILOT PROJECTS.  THE CITY\'S </p><p>DYNAMISM HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SUCCESS AND EVENTUAL </p><p>NATIONWIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF MANY OF THESE PROJECTS. </p><p>DPO SUGGESTED HCMC\'S DYNAMISM WILL BE AN IMPORTANT </p><p>FACTOR IN THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BTA, </p><p>INTIMATING THE HCMC CPC WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>PLAY A DIRECT ROLE IN CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01316  231000Z </p><p>SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.  RESPONDING TO A </p><p>FOLLOW-ON POINT ABOUT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE </p><p>INTERNET, CUONG SAID EXPLICITLY THAT THE CPC </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THERE WILL HAVE TO BE MORE OPENNESS IN </p><p>ORDER FOR VIETNAM TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL </p><p>MARKETPLACE. </p><p> </p><p>4. CUONG SAID HE HOPES FOR BILATERAL COOPERATION ON BTA </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION, IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BTA BENEFICIAL FOR </p><p>BOTH SIDES.  HE SAID THE GVN IS IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>REVIEWING ITS POLICIES AT THE LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL </p><p>IN ORDER TO FIND AND ROOT OUT BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION.  HE ADDED THAT HE HOPES CONGEN HCMC </p><p>WILL PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN LINKING U.S. AND VIETNAMESE </p><p>BUSINESSES AND LOOKS FORWARD TO A CLOSER WORKING </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USG AND GVN. </p><p> </p><p>5. TURNING TO THE DELICATE ISSUE OF PRESS COVERAGE, DPO </p><p>ASKED HOW THE CONSULATE GENERAL COULD BEST WORK TO </p><p>ADDRESS A LACK OF BALANCE IN VIETNAMESE PRESS REPORTING </p><p>ON THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM IN AFGHANISTAN.  CUONG </p><p>REPLIED THAT, ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE DETAILS </p><p>ABOUT HOW REPORTING IS DEVELOPED, NEWSPAPERS IN VIETNAM </p><p>REPORT NEWS ONLY "TO THE LEVEL OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE."  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO INCOMPLETE INFORMATION, CUONG SAID ANOTHER </p><p>PROBLEM THE PRESS FACES IS THE GROWING </p><p>COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE PAPERS AND A RESULTING </p><p>SENSATIONALISM OF THE NEWS AS THE MEDIA COMPETES TO </p><p>"MAKE A BUCK."  HE SAID THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THE </p><p>PARTY ITSELF HAS BEEN DISPLEASED WITH PRESS REPORTING. </p><p>AT THE END OF THE DISCUSSION HE SAID HE "TOOK NOTE" OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01316  231000Z </p><p>THE ISSUE.  (NOTE: ALTHOUGH THERE IS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>LEEWAY IN THE WAY EDITORS CAN PRESENT THE NEWS, WE HAVE </p><p>BEEN TOLD THEY MUST CLEAR THEIR MATERIAL BEFORE IT IS </p><p>PUBLISHED TO ENSURE IT IS IN LINE WITH PARTY VIEWS -- </p><p>WHICH ON IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE DETERMINED IN HANOI.) </p><p> </p><p>6. COMMENT:  THIS MEETING FOUND CUONG MORE WILLING TO </p><p>ENGAGE THAN IN THE PAST, WHILE STILL FOCUSED ON SET </p><p>RESPONSES TO SENSITIVE TOPICS.  ON ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, IN PARTICULAR, IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THIS </p><p>CPC OFFICIAL EXPRESSED HIGH HOPES FOR THE BTA AND </p><p>AGREED PROPER IMPLEMENTATION IS IMPORTANT AND WILL </p><p>REQUIRE SOME CHANGES.  HE ALSO CONFIRMED HCMC\'S ROLE AS </p><p>AN INCUBATOR FOR NEW IDEAS -- AND WAS EVEN QUICK TO </p><p>PICK UP ON THE NEED FOR MORE OPENNESS TO ATTRACT </p><p>FOREIGN BUSINESS.  IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP </p><p>PROGRAMS EARLY ON, WHICH WILL HELP HCMC CAPITALIZE ON </p><p>THE BTA AND BECOME A MODEL FOR MODERN BUSINESS </p><p>PRACTICES COUNTRYWIDE.
