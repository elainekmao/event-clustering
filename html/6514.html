SUMMARY:  PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MARCH 18TH ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN </p><p>PEOPLE GENERATED EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL PRINT </p><p>AND SATELLITE MEDIA.  \'AL KHALEEJ\' CARRIED THE FULL TEXT OF THE </p><p>ADDRESS WHILE OTHER ENGLISH AND ARABIC DAILIES CARRIED LENGTHY </p><p>EXCERPTS.  AN \'AKHABAR AL ARAB\' EDITORIAL SUGGESTS THAT THE BEST </p><p>SACRIFICE SADDAM COULD MAKE FOR HIS COUNTRY IS TO STEP DOWN. </p><p>OTHER EDITORIALS STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE U.S. DETERMINATION FOR </p><p>WAR, NOTING THAT IRAQ IS ONLY THE BEGINNING AND OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES WILL BE NEXT.  EDITORIALS AND NEWS ALSO FEATURED LOCAL </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS, THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ELECTED UAE FEDERAL </p><p>NATIONAL COUNCIL (FNC) REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE KILLING OF AN </p><p>AMERICAN PEACE ACTIVIST, RACHEL CORRIE, IN ISRAEL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON 3/18, SEVERAL LOCAL ENGLISH AND ARABIC DAILIES REPORTED </p><p>WITH PHOTOS A DEMONSTRATION IN RAS AL KHAIMAH AGAINST U.S. </p><p>POLICIES IN THE REGION.  COVERAGE ALSO INCLUDED AN ARTICLE ON </p><p>STUDENT PLANS TO SEND A 30-METER LONG \'PEACE BANNER\' TO THE WHITE </p><p>HOUSE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DUBAI-BASED ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY \'GULF NEWS\' ON 3/18 AND </p><p>SEVERAL LOCAL ARABIC DAILIES ON 3/19 CARRIED INSIDE-PAGE ARTICLES </p><p>CITING SHEIKH KHALED BIN SAQR AL QASIMI, RAS AL KHAIMAH (RAK) </p><p>CROWN PRINCE AND DEPUTY RULER, AS SAYING THAT A YEAR FROM NOW, </p><p>THE FEDERAL NATIONAL COUNCIL (FNC) MEMBERS OF RAK WOULD BE </p><p>ELECTED AND NOT APPOINTED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  CLAIMING IRAQ WILL BE A MODEL FOR WHOEVER DOES NOT ABIDE BY </p><p>U.S. POLICIES IN THE FUTURE, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/19: </p><p> </p><p>"... DURING THIS CRUCIAL TIME, FROM THE ELIMINATION OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM INITIATED SIXTY YEARS AGO AFTER WORLD WAR </p><p>II, SOMETHING THAT FELL WITH THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION DECISION IN </p><p>FOR A WAR ON IRAQ, TO A NEW AMERICAN SYSTEM, SOMETHING WASHINGTON </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO IMPOSE ON THE WORLD.  WHAT IS GOING TO FACE IRAQ </p><p>DURING THIS WAR WILL BE THE \'IDEAL\' MODEL THAT WILL BE IMPOSED ON </p><p>ALL OPPONENTS, NAY-SAYERS, AND ALL PEOPLE REJECTING BRITISH- </p><p>AMERICAN POLICIES ..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S ULTIMATUM FOR WAR IN HIS </p><p>ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY </p><p>"AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/19: </p><p> </p><p>"... SACRIFICING FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR COUNTRY IS NOT ALWAYS BY </p><p>GOING INTO BATTLES AND BECOMING A MARTYR, IT COULD ALSO BE </p><p>REALIZED THROUGH SIMPLE SACRIFICES, SUCH AS A LEADER STEPPING </p><p>DOWN FROM THE PRESIDENCY.  ISN\'T THIS A SACRIFICE A PRESIDENT CAN </p><p>OFFER IN RETURN FOR AVERTING UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERINGS AND </p><p>UNBELIEVABLE CONSEQUENCES FROM HIS OWN FELLOW CITIZENS?  HE CAN </p><p>SPARE HIS PEOPLE A DEAR PRICE ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON A RECENT DEBATE BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER TONY </p><p>BLAIR AND A NUMBER OF BRITISH WOMEN, KHALAF AHMED AL HABTOOR </p><p>EDITORIALIZED IN \'GULF NEWS\' ON 3/18: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT WAS A SERIOUS AND CONSTRUCTIVE DEBATE, NOT AS SUPERFICIAL </p><p>AS WE ARE USED TO IN MANY OF THE SO-CALLED ARAB \'DEBATES\' ... I </p><p>ADMIT THAT MY ADMIRATION FOR THIS GREAT PEOPLE DOUBLED ... BUT I </p><p>ALSO HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH DISAPPOINTMENT </p><p>WHEN I REMEMBERED THE SITUATION OF DEMOCRACY IN THE ARAB WORLD. </p><p>WHEN I COMPARED THE INDIFFERENT AND BITTER ARAB STATUS TO THAT </p><p>DEBATE, I FELT ENGULFED WITH FRUSTRATION ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN AN EDITORIAL ENTITLED \'NOTING HUMANE QUESTIONS IN AN </p><p>INHUMANE TIME,\' "AL KHALEEJ" COMMENTED ON 3/18: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHY DID THE PEACE ACTIVIST RACHEL CORRIE LEAVE HER COUNTRY </p><p>AND COME TO PALESTINE TO TAKE A HUMAN STAND WITH THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>PALESTINE, WHO ARE SUBJECT TO DAILY ATTACKS BY THE WAR CRIMINAL </p><p>SHARON?  WHY ARE OTHER PEOPLE LEAVING IRAQ, KUWAIT, SYRIA, AND </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, LEAVING THEIR PEOPLE TO FACE THE </p><p>FIRE OF THOUSANDS OF MISSILES AND BOMBS, INCLUDING \'THE MOTHER OF </p><p>ALL BOMBS,\' WHICH WEIGHS AROUND TEN TONS?  THESE ARE HUMANE </p><p>QUESTIONS IN AN INHUMAN TIME." </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENTING ON THE NOW-CLOSED DIPLOMATIC DOORS TO ANY SOLUTION </p><p>OF THE CRISIS IN IRAQ, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/18: </p><p> </p><p>"... WILL SADDAM DO IT?  WILL HE BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTERESTS </p><p>OF HIS PEOPLE AND NOT HIS OWN?  WILL HE LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF </p><p>WISDOM AND REASON IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN </p><p>SUFFERING FOR YEARS NOW, AND WHO ARE STILL DREAMING THAT THIS WAR </p><p>COULD BE AVOIDED?  WILL SADDAM, AS HIS HABIT IN THE LAST TEN </p><p>YEARS, BACK OFF AT THE LAST MINUTE AND GRANT MILLIONS OF IRAQIS </p><p>THE HOPE THEY HAVE BEEN AWAITING SO LONG?" </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENTING ON THE DEATH OF AMERICAN PEACE ACTIVIST RACHEL </p><p>CORRIE, KILLED BY AN ISRAELI BULLDOZER, "AKHBAR AL ARAB" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/18: </p><p> </p><p>"... RACHEL IS UNIQUE.  SHE CARRIED OUT A MISSION FILLED WITH </p><p>NOBLE MEANING TO PALESTINIANS, ARABS, AMERICANS, MOTHERS AND </p><p>FATHERS, AND ALSO TO ALL NATIONS OF THE WORLD ... SHE DESERVES TO </p><p>BE OFFICIALLY HONORED.  SHE DESERVES TO BE REMEMBERED BY THE ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE BECAUSE SHE IS REALLY IN THE HEARTS OF ALL ARABS AS A MOST </p><p>NOBLE AND HONEST EMISSARY (FOR PEACE)." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
