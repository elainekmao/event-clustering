<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 005893 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND NEA/ARP </p><p>NSC FOR CLARKE, RIEDEL AND POLLACK </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/30/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, XF, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SULTAN BIN ZAYID: "MUST THE U.S. BE TOUGHER </p><p>          THAN THE ISRAELIS ON PALESTINE?" </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY THEODORE H. KATTOUF, AMBASSADOR, </p><p>REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  A FRIENDLY BUT CLEARLY FRUSTRATED SULTAN BIN </p><p>ZAYID, UAE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND SECOND SON OF PRESIDENT </p><p>ZAYID BIN SULTAN, CONVEYED TO AMBASSADOR IN FRANK, DELIBERATE </p><p>TERMS OCTOBER 29 HIS OWN "AND MANY OTHERS\'" DEEP DISAPPOINTMENT </p><p>THAT THE U.S., IN ITS "UNCRITICAL SUPPORT" FOR ISRAEL AND HARSH </p><p>CRITICISMS OF THE PALESTINIANS, HAD BETRAYED ITS HISTORICAL </p><p>REPUTATION AS A CHAMPION OF FAIRNESS, JUSTICE AND THE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE OF OPPRESSED PEOPLES.  THE ARABS, HE SAID, NO LONGER </p><p>HAD ANY EXPECTATIONS THAT THE U.S. WOULD SERVE AS AN HONEST </p><p>BROKER FOR PEACE, AND THIS COULD HAVE RAMIFICATIONS FOR LARGER </p><p>U.S.-ARAB RELATIONS, "WHICH WAS NOT GOOD FOR EITHER OF US." </p><p>OFFERING HIS CONDOLENCES FOR THE LOSS OF LIFE RESULTING FROM THE </p><p>"COWARDLY" ATTACK ON THE USS COLE, SULTAN WARNED THAT EXTREMISTS </p><p>WOULD CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT TENSIONS IN THE REGION TO FURTHER THEIR </p><p>OWN AGENDAS.  IN A RARE COMMENTARY ON LEBANON, SULTAN LABELED </p><p>SYRIAN POLICY THERE "DISASTROUS," AND SAID THE UAE WOULD BE THE </p><p>FIRST TO APPLAUD THE WITHDRAWAL OF SYRIAN TROOPS FROM LEBANESE </p><p>SOIL.  SULTAN\'S UNVARNISHED VIEWS NO DOUBT REFLECT HIS FATHER\'S </p><p>THINKING, ALTHOUGH SULTAN SAID HE HAD AVOIDED RAISING THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES IN RECENT DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>HIS RECUPERATING FATHER SO AS NOT TO UPSET ZAYID.  THE MEETING </p><p>WAS GIVEN EXTENSIVE MEDIA COVERAGE THAT EVENING AND IN THE </p><p>FOLLOWING DAY\'S PRESS, UNDER THE HEADLINE "THE UAE URGES </p><p>WASHINGTON TO BE HONEST AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>MORE ZIONIST THAN THE ISRAELIS? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, WHO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE </p><p>DCM, ON OCTOBER 29 AT HIS SEASIDE PALACE, UAE DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER SULTAN BIN ZAYID -- RENOWNED FOR HIS FRANKNESS -- WASTED </p><p>LITTLE TIME WITH CONVENTIONAL FORMALITIES BEFORE LAUNCHING INTO A </p><p>CRITIQUE OF THE U.S. RESPONSE TO RECENT VIOLENCE IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES.  SPEAKING QUIETLY (NOTE: IN TYPICAL BEDOUIN FASHION </p><p>WHEN EXPRESSING DISAPPOINTMENT TO A FRIEND.  END NOTE.) AND IN </p><p>ARABIC, SULTAN ASKED WHY IT WAS THAT THE U.S. APPEARED TO BE </p><p>TAKING A TOUGHER POLITICAL STANCE AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS IN THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION THAN EVEN ISRAEL?  STRESSING THAT THIS WAS NOT </p><p>JUST HIS OPINION, BUT WHAT HE WAS HEARING IN THE MAJLISES AS </p><p>WELL, SULTAN SAID THERE WAS GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>ARAB WORLD IN THE U.S. FAILURE TO ACT AS AN HONEST BROKER. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE ARABS WERE BLAMING THE U.S. MORE THAN ISRAEL FOR </p><p>THE CRISIS BECAUSE IT WAS IN A POSITION TO DO SOMETHING AND DID </p><p>NOT.  "THE ISRAELIS ARE FIRING U.S. WEAPONS -- APACHE HELICOPTER </p><p>GUNSHIPS AND M16 RIFLES -- AGAINST UNARMED PALESTINIAN CHILDREN," </p><p>SULTAN SAID; "THE WORLD HAD WITNESSED SCENES OF BEASTLY BEHAVIOR </p><p>ON THE PART OF THE ISRAELIS, AND YET THE U.S. CRITICIZES THE </p><p>ARABS."  THE ARABS HAD EXPECTED MUCH MORE OF THE U.S., GIVEN ITS </p><p>HISTORY OF STANDING UP FOR JUSTICE, HUMAN RIGHTS AND FAIR </p><p>TREATMENT, AND ITS OWN SUCCESSFUL FIGHT FOR INDEPENDENCE AGAINST </p><p>AN OPPRESSOR NATION.  THE PALESTINIANS HAD BEEN LIVING UNDER ONE </p><p>FORM OF OCCUPATION OR ANOTHER FOR YEARS.  THEY WERE LOSING ALL </p><p>HOPE.  ALL THEY WERE SEEKING WAS THEIR INDEPENDENCE.  THE ARABS </p><p>WOULD ACCEPT THE ISRAELIS AND THEIR NEED FOR SECURITY IF THEY, IN </p><p>TURN, WOULD ACCEPT BOUNDARIES AND THE SOVEREIGNTY OF OTHERS. </p><p>THEY COULD NOT RELY FOREVER ON THEIR NUCLEAR ARSENALS TO PROTECT </p><p>THEM; THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE PEACE WITH THEIR ARAB NEIGHBORS. </p><p>BUT, SULTAN CONTINUED, EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE COULD NOT OFFER A </p><p>BALANCED ASSESSMENT OF THE CONFLICT, AND SO THE ARABS NO LONGER </p><p>HAD EXPECTATIONS OF AMERICAN FAIRNESS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE TRAGIC ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT </p><p>CRISIS AND OFFERING HIS SYMPATHIES TO THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE, THE AMBASSADOR URGED SULTAN TO TAKE THE LONGER VIEW. </p><p>ALL PARTIES HAD EVOLVED IN THE PROCESS OF SEEKING PEACE, AND MUCH </p><p>HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE YEARS, IN PARTICULAR, FOLLOWING </p><p>THE MADRID CONFERENCE.  RABIN AND PERES RECOGNIZED THE GROWING </p><p>THREAT IRAN AND IRAQ POSED AND DECIDED TO MAKE PEACE WITH THEIR </p><p>NEIGHBORS AND DEAL WITH THE PLO.  ALTHOUGH ONCE SHUNNED, ARAFAT </p><p>HAD VISITED PRESIDENT CLINTON AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON NUMEROUS </p><p>OCCASIONS AND WAS TREATED AS A FULL PARTNER IN THE SEARCH FOR </p><p>PEACE.  THE REASON THINGS HAD NOW FLARED UP SO BADLY WAS </p><p>PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE PROGRESS MADE AT CAMP DAVID II, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE REQUIREMENT TO DEAL WITH JERUSALEM AND ITS HOLY </p><p>PLACES.  THE EXTREMISTS WERE WORRIED.  BUT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO </p><p>FORGET OR THROW AWAY ALL THE PROGRESS MADE OVER THE PAST DECADE </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE TRAGIC EVENTS OF THE PAST MONTH.  WHAT WAS NOW </p><p>IMPORTANT WAS THAT THE VIOLENCE CEASE SO THAT PASSIONS COULD </p><p>COOL.  THE U.S. WOULD REMAIN ENGAGED IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE NO </p><p>MATTER WHO WON THE UPCOMING U.S. ELECTIONS, AS THIS WAS IN THE </p><p>NATIONAL INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>THE CONSEQUENCES FOR LARGER U.S.-ARAB RELATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  SULTAN AGREED THAT "THIS WILL PASS (I.E. THE CRISIS); IT </p><p>IS LIFE," WHILE EXPRESSING HIS HOPE THAT IT DID NOT GET WORSE. </p><p>OTHERWISE, HE SAID, THERE WOULD BE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR U.S.- </p><p>ARAB RELATIONS.  IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR MODERATE ARAB LEADERS </p><p>TO DEFEND CONTINUED CLOSE TIES TO THE U.S. OR TO DEFLECT </p><p>ACCUSATIONS THAT THE U.S. IS MANIPULATING THEM UNLESS THE U.S. IS </p><p>SEEN TO BE FAIR ON ISSUES IMPORTANT TO THE ARABS.  OFFERING HIS </p><p>CONDOLENCES FOR THE DEATH OF THE 17 SAILORS FOLLOWING THE </p><p>"COWARDLY" ATTACK ON THE USS COLE, SULTAN SUGGESTED A LINKAGE </p><p>BETWEEN SUCH ACTS OF TERRORISM AND THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN </p><p>CONFLICT.  IN THIS CONTEXT, SULTAN REMARKED THAT THE U.S. SEEMED </p><p>TO FORGET THAT ISRAEL HAD "CREATED" HAMAS AND SUPPORTED HIZBOLLAH </p><p>AS COUNTERWEIGHTS TO THE PLO.  NOW THESE EXTREMIST GROUPS WERE </p><p>OUT OF CONTROL, PRESENTING A THREAT TO ALL CONCERNED.  YET WHEN </p><p>THEY ATTACK, SULTAN SUGGESTED, THE REAL VICTIM IS U.S.-ARAB </p><p>RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>BUT ISRAEL NOT THE ONLY OCCUPYING POWER... </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  EXPANDING ON HIS THEME OF ISRAELI ATTEMPTS TO DOMINATE </p><p>AND POLARIZE -- RATHER THAN LIVE WITH -- HER NEIGHBORS (AND </p><p>ALLUDING TO PERCEIVED ISRAELI EFFORTS TO CANTONIZE THE WEST </p><p>BANK), SULTAN DESCRIBED ISRAELI EFFORTS TO "DIVIDE AND CONTROL" </p><p>LEBANON THROUGH THE CREATION OF A SERIES OF SECTARIAN CANTONS. </p><p>"THIS WAS BEN GURION\'S AND SUBSEQUENTLY SHARON\'S PLAN," HE SAID, </p><p>"AND IT DIDN\'T WORK."  THE AMBASSADOR IMPLIED THAT SYRIA HAD </p><p>CONTRIBUTED ITS SHARE TO LEBANON\'S TRAVAILS, AIDED AND ABETTED BY </p><p>CERTAIN LEBANESE POLITICIANS WHO CONTINUED TO LOOK TOWARD </p><p>DAMASCUS FOR DECISIONS EVEN ON TRIVAL MATTERS.  SULTAN READILY </p><p>AGREED THAT SYRIA\'S POLICIES IN LEBANON WERE "DISASTROUS," AND </p><p>EFFECTIVELY JUST ANOTHER FORM OF OCCUPATION.  THERE WOULD BE </p><p>BROAD ARAB SUPPORT FOR SYRIA\'S WITHDRAWAL OF ITS MILITARY TROOPS </p><p>FROM LEBANON AND "THE UAE WOULD HEAD THE LIST."  "I KNOW THIS," </p><p>SULTAN EMPHASIZED, "AND CAN SPEAK FOR MY COUNTRY\'S POSITION." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE TELEVISION CAMERAS AND CREW THAT AWAITED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S ARRIVAL SIGNALED SULTAN\'S INTENTION TO USE THIS </p><p>MEETING AS MUCH TO MOLLIFY AN ANGRY POPULACE AS TO PASS A MESSAGE </p><p>TO THE U.S.  INDEED, THE MEETING WAS GIVEN PROMINENT COVERAGE ON </p><p>THE EVENING NEWS AND IN THE FOLLOWING MORNING\'S PRESS, WITH AN </p><p>UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF DETAIL.  OPTICS ASIDE, SULTAN\'S MESSAGE WAS </p><p>SINCERE AND REFLECTS WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM A BROAD RANGE OF </p><p>CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KATTOUF </p><p></p></div>
