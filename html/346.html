<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOGADISHU 01773 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, PINS, PINR, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOMALIS UNDULY GLOOMY OVER NEW CABINET </p><p> </p><p>REF:  MOGADISHU 1691 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  SEVERAL SOMALI FRIENDS CONFIDED DISAPPOINT- </p><p>MENT TO US OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT THE MAKEUP OF </p><p>PRESIDENT SIAD\'S NEW GOVERNMENT.  THEY GENERALLY </p><p>CONSIDERED THE LINEUP POLITICALLY WEAK (THOUGH </p><p>TECHNICALLY STRONGER) AND OF LITTLE VALUE TO THE POLITICAL </p><p>REFORM PROCESS.  I\'VE TOLD THEM THEY ARE TOO PESSIMISTIC, </p><p>THAT I PERCEIVE A POLITICAL COMPROMISE NEUTRALIZING SOME </p><p>IMPORTANT OPPONENTS OF REFORM AND LEAVING PRESIDENT SIAD </p><p>FREE TO MOVE AHEAD -- IF HE WILL ONLY DO SO.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>POLITICALLY WEAK CABINET </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  ABDULKADIR ADAN ABDULLAH, SON OF SOMALIA\'S FIRST </p><p>PRESIDENT AND SOMETIME POLITICAL PRISONER, SHOWED UP </p><p>EARLY FOR OUR FAREWELL FUNCTION FOR DEPARTING ITALIAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR FEBRUARY 17.  BEFORE OTHER GUESTS ARRIVED, </p><p>ABDULKADIR COMMENTED THAT THE NEW LIST OF APPOINTMENTS </p><p>LEFT PRESIDENT SIAD IN UNCHALLENGED CONTROL OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  PRACTICALLY NONE OF THE NEW MINISTERS COULD </p><p>CLAIM TO REPRESENT ANY POLITICAL OR TRIBAL FACTION, </p><p>ABDULKADIR REMARKED.  ALL OF THEM WOULD BE VIEWED AS BEING </p><p>ENTIRELY IN SIAD\'S POCKET. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME TO ABDULKADIR WAS THE </p><p>CHANGED SITUATION IN THE MILITARY AND AT THE DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTRY, AS A RESULT OF GENERAL MORGAN\'S SHIFT TO THE </p><p>PUBLIC WORKS MINISTRY.  THIS, SAID ABDULKADIR, LEFT THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S SON GENERAL MASLAH IN UNCHALLENGED CONTROL </p><p>OF THE ENTIRE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT (SINCE DEFMIN </p><p>"MATAN" , A CIVILIAN, IS CONSIDERED INCONSEQUENTIAL). </p><p>ABDULKADIR COMMENTED THAT MORGAN\'S PRESENCE IN THE DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTRY HAD REPRESENTED SOME CONSTRAINT ON MASLAH, AND </p><p>HE CLAIMED THAT TENSION HAD BEEN GROWING BETWEEN THE TWO. </p><p>BUT MORGAN HAD, IN EFFECT, BEEN BOUGHT OFF BY BEING </p><p>GIVEN THE LUCRATIVE PUBLIC WORKS PORTFOLIO IN EXCHANGE </p><p>FOR SURRENDERING HIS MILITARY ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>LITTLE IMPULSE TO REFORM </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  ABDURRAHMAN OSMAN "SHUKEH" ALSO ARRIVED AT OUR </p><p>LUNCHEON IN A MOOD IF DISAPPOINTMENT OVER THE CABINET </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT.  SHUKEH (WHO HAD HIMSELF DECLINED AN </p><p>APPOINTMENT) WARNED THAT THIS CABINET WAS LIKELY TO DO </p><p>LITTLE TO LEAD THE COUNTRY THROUGH CONSTITUTIONAL REVISIONS </p><p>AND INTO MULTIPARTY ELECTIONS THIS YEAR.  HE SAID THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HAD MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO GARNER SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE REFORM PROCESS WHICH HE COULD HAVE WON BY NAMING </p><p>FIGURES TO THE NEW CABINET WHO COULD SPEAK FOR PARTICULAR </p><p>INTEREST GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY.  INSTEAD, HE CHOSE TO </p><p>NAME TECHNOCRATS AND PERSONS HE COULD EASILY MANIPULATE </p><p>HIMSELF.  SHUKEH, WHO IS A FORMER MINISTER OF EDUCATION </p><p>AND NOW SECRETARY OF THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, WAS NOT </p><p>HOPEFUL THAT SIAD WOULD WIN MUCH CREDIBILITY AMONG </p><p>SOMALIS WITH HIS NEW APPOINTMENTS NOR ACHIEVE THE POLITICAL </p><p>CONSENSUS NEEDED FOR FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>A COMPROMISE BETWEEN RIVAL FAMILY GROUPS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  EARLIER IN THE DAY, NURTA HAJI HASSAN, A LAWYER AND </p><p>DEPUTY STATE COUNSEL AT THE PRESIDENCY, DROPPED BY THE </p><p>RESIDENCE TO CHAT WITH MY WIFE.  SHE WATCHED MUCH OF THE </p><p>SELECTION PROCESS FROM THE INSIDE OF VILLA SOMALIA OVER </p><p>THE PAST 40 DAYS AND DESCRIBED THE OUTCOME AS A PAINFUL </p><p>COMPROMISE BETWEEN OLD GUARD SUPPORTERS OF PRIME MINISTER </p><p>SAMANTAR (INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT\'S WIFE KHADIJA) AND </p><p>MAREHAN-FIRST ELEMENTS OF THE FAMILY CONNECTED WITH FORMER </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER JAMA BARRE.  THE COMPROMISE CONSISTED </p><p>ESSENTIALLY OF EXCLUDING OLD GUARD MEMBERS SULEIMAN </p><p>ABDALLAH (EX-INTERIOR MINISTER), KULMIE AFRAH (EX-PUBLIC </p><p>WORKS), AND MOHAMED SHEIKH OSMAN (EX-FINMIN) ON ONE SIDE; </p><p>AND EXCLUDING JAMA BARRE HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHILE </p><p>ADDING HIS PAL ABDULKADIR HAJI MQHAMED AS INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.  NURTA WAS NOT ENTIRELY NEGATIVE ABOUT THE RESULTS, </p><p>AS SHE SAID IT MADE WAY FOR A NUMBER OF TECHNOCRATS AND </p><p>CAPABLE YOUNGER MEN TO BE GIVEN PORTFOLIOS.  SOME OF THESE </p><p>HAD PROVEN TO BE COMPETENT BUREAUCRATS AT THE DIRGEN OR </p><p>EVEN VICE MINISTER LEVEL; OTHERS BROUGHT EXCELLENT </p><p>CREDENTIALS FROM FOREIGN TRAINING TO THEIR JOBS. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, NURTA CONCEDED THAT THE CABINET WAS </p><p>POLITICALLY A VERY WEAK ONE THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO </p><p>SOLVE ANY OF THE COUNTRY\'S DEEPER PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>BETTER ON THE INSIDE THAN THE OUTSIDE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE WIFE OF ISAAK POLITBURO MEMBER AHMED MOHAMOUD </p><p>FARAH TOLD MRS. CRIGLER THAT HER HUSBAND IS NOT EXACTLY </p><p>PROUD TO BE APPOINTED TO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS WILL BE A </p><p>PURELY CEREMONIAL POST AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER.  SHE </p><p>SAID ISAAKS ARE NOT FOOLED BY HAVING ONE OF THEIR NUMBER </p><p>ASSIGNED THE NUMBER TWO CABINET SLOT, BUT THEY CONSIDER </p><p>IT USEFUL TO HAVE SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE KEEPING TRACK OF </p><p>THINGS AND EXERCISING AT LEAST SOME MODERATING INFLUENCE </p><p>ON THE PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>MAYBE OUR FRIENDS ARE TOO PESSIMISTIC </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.   SOMALIS LOVE TO LOOK ON THE DARK SIDE OF THINGS, AND </p><p>THEY ESPECIALLY ENJOY READING NEGATIVE SIGNALS INTO </p><p>WHATEVER THE PRESIDENT ATTEMPTS TO DO THESE DAYS.  I\'VE </p><p>TRIED TO SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A BRIGHTER SIDE TO THE </p><p>NEW CABINET LIST: SPECIFICALLY, THAT IT INDEED DOES </p><p>REPRESENT A COMPROMISE -- PERHAPS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE -- </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO MOST POWERFUL COMPETING GROUPS AT VILLA </p><p>SOMALIA.  PERHAPS IN THE PROCESS THEY HAVE NEUTRALIZED </p><p>EACH OTHER, LEAVING THE WAY OPEN FOR PRESIDENT SIAD </p><p>HIMSELF TO SEIZE THE INITIATIVE AND REGAIN SOME MEASURE </p><p>OF PERSONAL LEADERSHIP.  IF HE IS TRULY SERIOUS ABOUT </p><p>REFORMS AND RECONCILIATION, THIS MAY BE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD DRAMATICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>10.  THE REAL QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED: IS SIAD PREPARED </p><p>TO SEIZE THE INITIATIVE AND BEGIN CAMPAIGNING SERIOUSLY FOR </p><p>THE POLITICAL REFORMS THE COUNTRY NEEDS AND HE HAS </p><p>PROMISED TO ACCEPT?  AND IF SO, IS HE PHYSICALLY AND </p><p>MENTALLY CAPABLE OF EXERCISING THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP </p><p>NEEDED TO ACHIEVE SUCH BASIC REFORMS?  UP TO NOW, HE HAS </p><p>HAD TO BE DRAGGED KICKING AND SCREAMING BY OTHERS INTO </p><p>THE REFORM PROCESS.  NOW THE WAY SEEMS OPEN, IF HE WILL </p><p>TAKE ADVANTAGE, TO MOVE ON TO THE OFFENSIVE AND TAKE CHARGE </p><p>OF THE REFORM PROCESS IN A POSITIVE SPIRIT.  UNLESS HE </p><p>DOES SO, THERE WILL BE NO REFORMS -- AND SIAD HAS GOT TO </p><p>RECOGNIZE THIS.  MY HOPE IS THAT OUR INTERLOCUTORS WILL </p><p>FIND A WAY TO GET THIS MESSAGE BACK TO THE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>SALVAGE HIS FAMILY AND TRIBAL INTERESTS, HIS REPUTATION, </p><p>AND HIS OWN SKIN. </p><p> </p><p>CRIGLER </p><p></p></div>
