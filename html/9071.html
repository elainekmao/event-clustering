As reported reftel, Canada is clearly shifting its </p><p>policy on telecommunications competition toward a more pro- </p><p>competitive model.  A decision announced by the GOC\'s </p><p>telecom regulator on June 30 reinforced this trend by </p><p>clarifying the terms of access of telecom service providers </p><p>to multi-unit residential buildings. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Telecom firms had complained that condominium and </p><p>apartment building owners/managers were able to restrict </p><p>competition in the provision of service to residents. </p><p>Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission </p><p>(CRTC) Decision 2003-45, "Provision of telecommunications </p><p>services to customers in multi-dwelling units," "establishes </p><p>the conditions and principles for the provision of </p><p>telecommunications services to customers located in multi </p><p>dwelling units (MDUs), including guidelines that will assist </p><p>building owners and local exchange carriers (LECs) in </p><p>negotiating just and expedient conditions of access to </p><p>MDUs."  The decision also addresses a number of related </p><p>matters, including the terms and conditions of access to </p><p>MDUs via the LECs\' facilities. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Text of the decision is available on the CRTC\'s website </p><p>at crtc.gc.ca under "what\'s new."  Inter alia, the decision </p><p>states that "LECs must have the ability to access and enter </p><p>into MDUs, in order to connect and/or install their </p><p>facilities, as well as repair and maintain them and </p><p>do whatever else may be required to provide reliable, high- </p><p>quality service to end-users.  . . . The Commission expects </p><p>building owners to cooperate with LECs to enable them to </p><p>access end-users in their MDUs."  The decision also states </p><p>that any exclusive-access arrangement between LECs and </p><p>building owners would be a violation of the </p><p>Telecommunications Act.  However, it says the CRTC will </p><p>allow "preferred marketing arrangements that are limited to </p><p>the marketing of a LEC\'s services in an MDU, so long as </p><p>these arrangements do not have the effect of limiting access </p><p>by other LECs." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
