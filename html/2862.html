<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001399 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR AFRICA WATCHER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: COMMONWEALTH-AFRICA INVESTMENT FORUM -- A </p><p>NON-EVENT </p><p> </p><p> 1. The Commonwealth Business Council (UK\'s equivalent to the </p><p>Corporate Council for Africa) in coordination with the GON, </p><p>hosted the annual Commonwealth-Africa Investment Forum in </p><p>Abuja April 22-24.  Embassy contacts at the British High </p><p>Commission reported that while the Forum was successful, </p><p>nothing of significance occurred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. President Wade of Senegal was the only Head of State to </p><p>attend, although Ministers from all Anglophone African </p><p>countries participated, including South Africa\'s Trade </p><p>Minister at the head of the largest African delegation. </p><p>Attendance from the developed world was small; approximately </p><p>25 UK citizens were here, all from private companies either </p><p>already on the ground in Nigeria or looking to enter the </p><p>market or veterans of non-government organizations.  In </p><p>addition, a small number of private companies from </p><p>non-Commonwealth European capitals attended.  Unlike last </p><p>year, no U.S. company was present. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Discussion at the Forum, according to the BHC Economic </p><p>Office, focused primarily on two issues: barriers in Africa </p><p>prohibiting foreign direct investment (FDI) and the </p><p>governance agenda.   However, the discussion did not result </p><p>in any new conclusions as to why Africa is not receiving more </p><p>of global FDI.  Many Africans expressed significant </p><p>frustration that FDI flows have not increased. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment.  This year\'s Commonwealth Forum appears to have </p><p>been a non-event, the latest in a growing string of </p><p>low-impact efforts to increase private sector interest in </p><p>Africa.  The World Tourism Organization\'s Commission for </p><p>Africa\'s held its 38th annual meeting in Abuja this week, and </p><p>this, too, proved lackluster.  Vice President Atiku </p><p>Abubakar\'s chosen stand-in sent his own stand-in, who opened </p><p>proceedings three hours behind schedule.  While events such </p><p>as the Tourism Commission meeting and the Commonwealth Forum </p><p>can showcase comfortable accommodations and modern conference </p><p>facilities, they cannot make Nigeria a destination for </p><p>tourists or FDI.  Nevertheless, GON efforts to substitute </p><p>showy manifestations for much-needed reforms are unlikely to </p><p>cease.  End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
