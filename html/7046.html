(C) DCM CONVEYED REF (A) DEMARCHE CONCERNING THE CUBAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ONGOING DISSIDENT CRACKDOWN MARCH 26 TO DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER PIETRO PAROLIN.  PAROLIN INDICATED THE HOLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01406  01 OF 02  021354Z </p><p>SEE WAS FOLLOWING THE CRACKDOWN WITH CONCERN, AND WOULD </p><p>CLOSELY REVIEW THE U.S. POINTS.  POLOFF FOLLOWED UP MARCH 28 </p><p>WITH MFA CUBAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONS. GIORGIO LINGUA, WHO </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE HOLY SEE WAS IN A "SPECIAL SITUATION" </p><p>VIS-A-VIS CUBA BECAUSE OF ITS NEED TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH PRESENCE THERE (REF B).  LINGUA POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO UNHRC COUNTRY </p><p>RESOLUTIONS WAS TO STAY AWAY FROM DIRECT ENGAGEMENT. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, THE HOLY SEE WOULD NOT ENGAGE ACTIVELY FOR A </p><p>UNHRC RESOLUTION CONDEMNING THE RECENT CUBAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>CRACKDOWN ON POLITICAL DISSIDENTS.  HE ASSURED US, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT "IF ANOTHER COUNTRY CAME TO SEEK OUR OPINION, WE WOULD </p><p>CERTAINLY UNDERSCORE THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF CASTRO\'S RECENT </p><p>ACTION." </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) REGARDING THE CONTENTS OF A UNHRC RESOLUTION, LINGUA </p><p>URGED THAT ANY SUCH RESOLUTION CONTAIN SOME CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>COMMENT SUCH AS NOTING THE CASTRO REGIME\'S PERMISSION FOR </p><p>OSVALDO PAYA TO TRAVEL TO EUROPE TO RECEIVE A HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>AWARD.  AS FOR PUBLICLY CALLING FOR RELEASE OF THE IMPRISONED </p><p>ACTIVISTS, LINGUA SAID THAT HOLY SEE GENERALLY DOES NOT ISSUE </p><p>PUBLIC APPEALS, BUT WOULD WORK QUIETLY AND DIRECTLY WITH </p><p>THOSE INVOLVED TO REMEDY THE SITUATION.  ASKED IF THAT MEANT </p><p>THE HOLY SEE WOULD INSTRUCT ITS NUNCIO IN HAVANA TO ENGAGE, </p><p>HE DEMURRED.  IN THIS REGARD, LINGUA (PROTECT) CONVEYED HIS </p><p>PERSONAL CHAGRIN THAT THE NUNCIO APPEARS TO HAVE "GIVEN UP ON </p><p>POLITICAL CHANGE UNDER THE CASTRO REGIME."  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>CARDINAL ORTEGA\'S RECENT STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE CRACKDOWN </p><p>(AND, WITH A SOP TO THE REGIME, DECRYING OUTSIDE </p><p>INTERFERENCE) WOULD HAVE TO DO FOR NOW. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01406  01 OF 02  021354Z </p><p>3. (C) ACCORDING TO LINGUA, THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THE CUBAN </p><p>CLERGY SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON CHURCH BUSINESS AND AVOID </p><p>ANTAGONIZING THE CASTRO REGIME IN ORDER TO AVERT ANY FURTHER </p><p>REPRESSION ON THE CHURCH.  IN AN EARLY MARCH CONVERSATION, </p><p>LINGUA TOLD POLOFF THAT CARDINAL ORTEGA IS TRYING TO BALANCE </p><p>SUCH "SOFT PRESSURE" ON THE GOC FOR GREATER RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM, AGAINST MORE THE OVERT POLITICAL ACTIVISM OF BISHOP </p><p>GONZALEZ OF PINAR DEL RIO.  AT THAT TIME LINGUA FEARED THAT </p><p>THE CASTRO GOVERNMENT MIGHT MOVE AGAINST BISHOP GONZALEZ IF </p><p>HE BECAME TOO "PROVOCATIVE" IN HIS SUPPORT OF DISSIDENT </p><p>ACTIVISTS.  LINGUA WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT CARDINAL </p><p>ORTEGA\'S STRONG PASTORAL LETTER DENOUNCING THE CONTINUING </p><p>LACK OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CUBA, AND CHARACTERIZED ORTEGA </p><p>AS "COURAGEOUS" AND THE LETTER AS EVIDENCE THAT ORTEGA IS </p><p>"LOSING TRUST" IN THE GOC\'S ABILITY TO LOOSEN CONTROLS ON THE </p><p>CHURCH. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) LINGUA EXHORTED THE U.S. TO BE CAUTIOUS IN HOW IT </p><p>PROMOTES CHANGE IN CUBA, OBSERVING THAT HE WAS SURPRISED THAT </p><p>USINT HAD BECOME SO ENERGETIC IN MEETING WITH DISSIDENTS, </p><p>PROVIDING BOOKS AND SPEAKING PUBLICLY.  HE NOTED THAT PRIOR </p><p>TO THE RECENT CRACKDOWN, THERE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SOME </p><p>IMPROVEMENT IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION, NOTABLY AN </p><p>INCREASING AWARENESS AMONG CUBAN CITIZENS OF THEIR RIGHTS AND </p><p>AN GREATER SENSE OF CIVIC ACTIVISM AMONG SOME -- PARTICULARLY </p><p>AS A RESULT OF THE VARELA PROJECT.  FOR THE CHURCH, HOWEVER, </p><p>HE BELIEVED THE SITUATION HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE COMPARED </p><p>TO LAST YEAR.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE OPENING OF THE </p><p>BRIGITTINE CONVENT (SEPTEL), THE CHURCH HADN\'T MADE ANY </p><p>PROGRESS OBTAINING GOC PERMISSION TO DEEPEN AND EXPAND ITS </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO FEAR THAT THE CHURCH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01406  01 OF 02  021354Z </p><p>IN CUBA REMAINS VULNERABLE TO RETRIBUTION FOR THE POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVISM OF SOME DISSIDENTS WHO OPENLY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  DESPITE THE HOLY SEE\'S COMPLETE REJECTION OF </p><p>THE ONGOING CUBAN ACTIONS, THE HESITATION TO SPEAK OUT </p><p>PUBLICLY REFLECTS THE INNATE CAUTION OF THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>SECRETARIAT OF STATE IN TAKING ACTIONS AGAINST REPRESSIVE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>REGIMES THAT ARE ABLE TO MAKE LIFE DIFFICULT FOR VULNERABLE </p><p>CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES.  WHILE THE VATICAN IS TROUBLED AND </p><p>ANGERED BY CASTRO\'S SUPPRESSION OF DISSIDENTS AND CRITICISM </p><p>OF USINT COM CASON, THEIR REACTION IS TO KEEP THEIR HEADS </p><p>DOWN AND WORK QUIETLY BEHIND THE SCENES.  LINGUA TOLD US </p><p>THERE ARE CUBAN DISSIDENTS WHO "TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CHURCH </p><p>TO PROMOTE THEIR POLITICS" SUCH AS DAGOBERTO VALDEZ, AND </p><p>OTHERS, LIKE OSVALDO PAYA, WHO "ACT AS (GOOD) LAY CATHOLICS." </p><p>  LINGUA\'S PREFERENCE FOR QUIET GAINS OVER THE LONG TERM FITS </p><p>WELL WITH AN INSTITUTION THAT FEELS IT HAS MUCH TO LOSE IF IT </p><p>TAKES A FALSE STEP.  EMBASSY WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS U.S. </p><p>CONCERNS ON THE CRACKDOWN, ESPECIALLY WITH FM TAURAN, WHO, AS </p><p>AN OLD CSCE/OSCE HAND, HAS A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF THE </p><p>BENEFITS OF A STRONG AND PUBLIC APPROACH TO CALLING FOR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6523 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01406  02 OF 02  021354Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  PA-00    SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------4F1898  021354Z /38 </p><p>O 021353Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>USINT HAVANA PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 001406 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), WHA/CCA, AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, CU, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE\'S PASSIVE APPROACH TO GOC DISSIDENT </p><p>CRACKDOWN </p><p> </p><p>RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01406 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
