<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000561 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/IP/AF, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/FPO, AF/W, AF/EX </p><p>LAGOS FOR RSO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, ALOW, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: ATTEMPTED ARMED ROBBERY AT RESIDENTIAL HOUSING </p><p>COMPOUND - ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: During the early morning hours of 22 March </p><p>2003, armed robbers penetrated the perimeter of a three-unit </p><p>Mission residential housing compound. LGF mobile patrol units </p><p>conducting routine compound patrols thwarted the attempted </p><p>robbery. There were no injuries and only slight property </p><p>damage reported. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Details: At approximately 0230 hours on Saturday, </p><p>March 22, 2003, two individuals with long weapons were </p><p>observed by LGF personnel lurking within the grounds of a </p><p>three-unit Mission housing complex. LGF personnel, including a </p><p>residential guard and mobile patrol supervisor, immediately </p><p>summoned assistance from host country police assigned to the </p><p>mobile patrol vehicle. Upon hearing the radio calls for </p><p>assistance, the two armed individuals fled the compound </p><p>through a hole they had cut in the razor wire along top the </p><p>rear perimeter wall. This wall is contiguous to a vacant </p><p>residential construction site. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Local police and LGF mobile patrol personnel </p><p>conducted a security sweep of the grounds for additional </p><p>assailants with negative results. However, they did discover a </p><p>heavy-duty pry bar that the robbers dropped while fleeing and </p><p>shoe marks on the interior side of the perimeter wall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The following morning, GSO personnel repaired the </p><p>damaged razor wire and replaced all non-functioning security </p><p>lights. RSO inspected the damage and determined that the razor </p><p>wire had been cleanly cut (likely using wire cutters) and that </p><p>the robbers had started a small fire on the attack side of the </p><p>wall for additional light. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Mobile patrol coverage of the area has been </p><p>increased and the Residential Security Coordinator (RSC) will </p><p>be supervising additional security upgrades at the location </p><p>over the next few days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The local police have been notified of the incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
