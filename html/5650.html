<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: A NEW WAVE OF POLITICAL ARRESTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Reuters reported on February 10 that the regime had </p><p>arrested 12 opposition activists for plotting to create </p><p>unrest in Burma.  The report did not provide many details on </p><p>the arrests but it did note that 7 low-level members of the </p><p>National League for Democracy (NLD) members and the Secretary </p><p>General of the Shan National League for Democracy (SNLD), Sai </p><p>Nyunt Lwin, were among those arrested. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  By late afternoon on February 10, NLD Secretary U </p><p>Lwin told Poloff that the regime\'s internal security branch, </p><p>Military Intelligence (MI), had alerted him to only two </p><p>recent arrests of NLD members, both on February 6.  He said </p><p>that earlier on February 10, MI had contacted him again to </p><p>say that one of these members had been released but that the </p><p>other, Khin Win from Kamayut township in Rangoon, was going </p><p>to be charged with conspiring with exile groups against the </p><p>State.  U Lwin said MI had not mentioned the additional </p><p>arrests reported by Reuters but he had heard on Radio Free </p><p>Asia that there had been 20 new political arrests. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  During the meeting with U Lwin, reports came in of 4 </p><p>more NLD members arrested that day in Rangoon townships. </p><p>Two, Thein Gyi and Thaung Gyi, were regular party members, </p><p>while two others, Tun Nyin and Tin Htut, were township NLD </p><p>secretaries.  Tin Htut was arrested just minutes before, when </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>he and another NLD member were walking to the headquarters </p><p>office.  The companion told Poloff that MI did not state why </p><p>Tin Htut was being arrested and warned the companion that it </p><p>was no concern of his.  (Note:  Later, NLD headquarters </p><p>contacted the Embassy to report that Tin Htut had been </p><p>released; MI had apparently arrested the wrong person.  End </p><p>Note) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  DCM met with SNLD Chairman Khun Htun Oo, who said </p><p>that the party\'s General Secretary (who was arrested on </p><p>February 7, which happens to be Shan State Day) was still </p><p>under arrest.  KHO said he had spoken to MI and was told that </p><p>there had been 14 arrests, 7 NLD and 7 others.  Among the </p><p>others were the General Secretary\'s nephew (who had since </p><p>been released), students, fortune tellers and people involved </p><p>in the informal banking sector.  The reason for the arrests </p><p>according to KHO\'s MI contact was a plot by students to </p><p>collaborate more closely with monks.  There was supposedly </p><p>approximately USD 1,500 associated with this "plot." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Comments:  While the details of these new political </p><p>arrests are obviously still sketchy, it appears that there is </p><p>a new crackdown underway against political activists.  The </p><p>final number of arrests and the junta\'s reasons for the </p><p>arrests should be clarified over the next few days.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
