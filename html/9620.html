<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004666 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULING THROWS MONKEY WRENCH </p><p>INTO TURKISH BUDGET, IMF REVIEW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ANKARA 4551 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 4480 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: The Turkish Constitutional Court this </p><p>afternoon annulled an additional tax on motor vehicles, </p><p>potentially creating a $780 million budget hole just as the </p><p>government was moving to fill a $1.65 billion fiscal gap as </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> part of an agreement with the IMF.  It is not clear yet </p><p>whether this decision will stick (i.e. is final), whether it </p><p>could prompt challenges to other GOT fiscal measures, or how </p><p>it will affect the IMF\'s Fifth Review.  Earlier in the day, </p><p>IMF ResRep had told us that he expected the GOT to complete </p><p>the remaining prior actions for the Fifth Review this week. </p><p>He also had identified key issues for the Sixth Review, </p><p>notionally scheduled for October, to include keeping on track </p><p>on the fiscal side (including the 2004 budget), agreeing on </p><p>language for direct tax reform legislation, parliamentary </p><p>approval of the Public Financial Management Law, and further </p><p>progress on reducing redundant State Economic Enterprise </p><p>workers.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The Constitutional Court this afternoon annulled </p><p>an additional tax on motor vehicles that the GOT had imposed </p><p>earlier this year.  The government had expected to collect </p><p>some TL 1.1 quadrillion ($780 million) in revenues through </p><p>this measure this year, so the court\'s decision potentially </p><p>creates a substantial hole in the budget.  It comes just as </p><p>the GOT had agreed to implement additional fiscal measures to </p><p>close a TL 2.3 quadrillion gap identified in discussions this </p><p>month with IMF staff.  The court, which was acting in </p><p>response to a suit brought by the opposition CHP party, </p><p>decided not to annual additional taxes on property. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) IMF ResRep and GOT officials with whom we spoke </p><p>tonight were scrambling to gauge the impact of the decision. </p><p>ResRep said the first question is whether this decision will </p><p>stick (i.e. is final) and, if so, whether it will affect the </p><p>nearly TL 400 trillion the government has already collected </p><p>via the tax.  The second is whether it will prompt legal </p><p>challenges to other fiscal measures, potentially creating a </p><p>larger fiscal gap.  The third, assuming the decision stands, </p><p>is how the GOT will fill the resulting gap, and how this </p><p>process will affect timing for the Fifth Review.  Although </p><p>the Court has not made public its reasoning, one Istanbul </p><p>analysts speculates that its concern had to do with legal </p><p>process, in which case the government could reintroduce the </p><p>additional tax via separate legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Earlier in the day, before the Court\'s decision, </p><p>IMF ResRep had provided us with further details on Fund-GOT </p><p>discussions and the just-concluded LOI.  He noted that the </p><p>fiscal gap was TL 2.3 quadrillion (not TL 2.5 quadrillion, as </p><p>previously reported), including the projected budget cost of </p><p>recent public sector pay hikes.  He largely confirmed -- with </p><p>a few amendments --  the Finance Ministry\'s analysis (ref B) </p><p>of how the GOT would fill the gap:  TL 1.2 quadrillion by </p><p>continuing a partial spending freeze (mostly on investments, </p><p>and including some savings from the lira\'s appreciation); TL </p><p>250 trillion via increasing Tekel (tobacco and spirits) </p><p>prices; TL 210 trillion via an increase in the Special </p><p>Transactions Tax and Educational Levy; TL 580 trillion </p><p>through turning "special revenues" over to the central budget </p><p>(see ref b for explanation); and TL 75 trillion through the </p><p>sale of Treasury\'s hazelnut stock.  ResRep said late today </p><p>that the government had implemented all of these measures, </p><p>save the partial spending freeze, which required a Finance </p><p>Minister circular (and which ResRep expects to be done in the </p><p>next day or two).  (Note:  None of these measures required </p><p>Parliament\'s approval.  End note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The other major prior action for the Fifth Review </p><p>was passage of the two remaining social security laws, </p><p>covering the Bag-Kur Fund for the self-employed and the </p><p>Social Security Fund.  Parliament is expected to pass both </p><p>pieces of legislation this week.  The one outstanding issue, </p><p>per ResRep, concerns the handling of social security arrears, </p><p>which total some $10 billion.  Here, the GOT and Fund staff </p><p>had been unable to reach agreement for months, as Fund staff </p><p>insisted they could not accept anything that smacked of a </p><p>general amnesty.  Fortunately, a Fund technical team that </p><p>came out with the latest Mission made significant progress, </p><p>and Fund staff now have an agreement on principles to be </p><p>inserted into the pending legislation.  ResRep said this </p><p>approach would preserve the net present value of the arrears </p><p>by linking them to government t-bill rates, while determining </p><p>the payment schedule based on a the individual\'s (or </p><p>company\'s) ability to pay.  ResRep expects the legislation to </p><p>reflect these principles, but is watching closely to ensure </p><p>there is no slippage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Given delays in other structural reforms, Fund </p><p>staff has added one more prior action for this review: </p><p>agreement on principles of the all-important Public Financial </p><p>Management Law, which will reshape Turkey\'s entire budgetary </p><p>process.  ResRep noted that this legislation has prompted </p><p>major bureaucratic disputes between the relevant ministries </p><p>(and ministers), but added that a ministerial-level meeting </p><p>last week had produced general agreement.  One of the more </p><p>difficult issues has been determining whether the Finance </p><p>Minister or State Planning Organization will have the lead on </p><p>implementing public investment projects.  ResRep said World </p><p>Bank officials want to study this question further; once they </p><p>give their blessing, the Fund will consider this prior action </p><p>completed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Looking ahead to the Sixth Review, ResRep said the </p><p>key issues will be keeping the budget on track, including </p><p>preparation of the 2004 budget; obtaining Parliament\'s </p><p>approval of the Public Financial Management Law and </p><p>legislation designed to strengthen the Banking Regulatory and </p><p>Supervisory Agency\'s (BRSA\'s) ability to deal with legal </p><p>challenges; and final agreement on direct tax reform </p><p>legislation.  On the latter, he noted that the intent of the </p><p>reform was to reduce tax incentives provided to various </p><p>regions and Turkey\'s numerous Free Zones.  However, this </p><p>effort was facing stiff political opposition, including from </p><p>State Minister for Trade Kursad Tuzmen.  The latest GOT draft </p><p>actually had extended tax incentives to nearly 50 percent of </p><p>Turkey\'s territory.  Fund staff decided the best approach was </p><p>to stop this version of the legislation from moving forward </p><p>(they succeeded), and to bring in another technical </p><p>assistance team to try to move the GOT in a better direction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Finally, ResRep reported that the government had </p><p>fallen short of its end-June target of eliminating 9900 </p><p>redundant positions at State Economic Enterprises (SEE\'s), </p><p>cutting only 7400.  He expressed hope that, with public </p><p>sector wage negotiations out of the way, the GOT would step </p><p>up its efforts and come close to reaching its 19,400 </p><p>end-September target. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
