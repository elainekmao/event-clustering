At approximately 7:30 a.m. local time on January 26, two </p><p>masked gunmen shot and killed Mohan Krishna Shrestha, </p><p>Inspector General of Police (IGP) for the Armed Police Force </p><p>(APF), as he was taking a morning walk near his residence. </p><p>Also killed were Shrestha\'s wife and bodyguard.  Residents in </p><p>the neighborhood reported hearing about 10 shots fired.  The </p><p>assailants fled without being apprehended, and no arrests </p><p>have yet been made. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The APF is a paramilitary police force formed nearly two </p><p>years ago primarily to help Nepal\'s beleaguered civil police </p><p>counter the Maoist insurgency.  Since their deployment </p><p>against the Maoists, 109 APF, including Shrestha, have been </p><p>killed.  Although no one has yet claimed responsibility for </p><p>the killings, the modus operandi mirrors several similar </p><p>slayings in the Kathmandu Valley--including those of two </p><p>Embassy security guards--which the Maoists have acknowledged </p><p>committing. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Comment:  Although the Maoists have killed 884 civilians </p><p>and 1,313 members of the security forces in nearly seven </p><p>years of the insurgency, Shrestha is the first figure of </p><p>national prominence to die in the conflict.  The Maoists have </p><p>staged no major assaults since their November 15 attack on </p><p>the district headquarters in Jumla (Reftel).  Some observers </p><p>had optimistically interpreted their relative quiescence as a </p><p>sign that the insurgents were serious about pursuing dialogue </p><p>with the government.  This brutal assassination obviously </p><p>belies such hopes.  Shrestha\'s wife was a teaching assistant </p><p>at Lincoln International School, which most Mission dependent </p><p>children attend.  The school has announced a one-day closure </p><p>for January 27 in commemoration of Mrs. Shrestha. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
