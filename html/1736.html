IRVING. REASONS: 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01815  061504Z </p><p>1.  (U) FORMER US AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS ANDREW YOUNG PAID A </p><p>BRIEF VISIT TO  ZIMBABWE JUNE 4-6, 2001, MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>AND GOVERNMENT MINISTERS ON JUNE 5. AFTER MEETING PRESIDENT MUGABE, </p><p>FORMER AMBASSADOR YOUNG GRANTED A LENGTHY INTERVIEW TO THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION (ZBC). EXCERPTS OF THAT </p><p>INTERVIEW RECEIVED PROMINENT PLAY ON ZBC\'S PRIME TIME EVENING </p><p>TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM ON JUNE 5.  ZBC RADIO ALSO CARRIED REPORTS OF </p><p>FORMER AMBASSADOR YOUNG\'S COMMENTS, AND THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY </p><p> </p><p>"THE HERALD" GAVE THE STORY FRONT-PAGE PLAY. INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE </p><p>DAILY NEWS" RAN THE STORY ON PAGE 2. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE GIST OF YOUNG\'S COMMENTS TO THE MEDIA WAS THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE WAS DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING AN INITIATIVE (THE LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM) TO CORRECT HISTORIC INJUSTICES. YOUNG SAID THAT, "PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE IS DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB HERE THAN THE BRITISH ARE DOING IN </p><p>MANAGING IRELAND" (SIC). YOUNG SET OUT THE HISTORICAL REASONS FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S SITUATION BY SAYING THAT GOVERNMENTS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND </p><p>THE UNITED STATES HAD FAILED TO LIVE UP TO COMMITMENTS TO SUPPORT LAND </p><p>REFORM IN ZIMBABWE MADE DURING THE LANCASTER HOUSE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>IN 1979. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) YOUNG SAID THAT ZIMBABWE WAS BEING UNFAIRLY VICTIMIZED BY </p><p>"PROPAGANDA AGAINST THE COUNTRY." HE ALSO SAID THAT "MUGABE\'S CRITICS </p><p>ACT AS IF MUGABE HAS NOT BEEN ELECTED AND THEY FORGET THAT WHO RULES </p><p>THE COUNTRY IS THE PREROGATIVE OF ZIMBABWEANS - AFTER ALL, MUGABE HAS A </p><p> </p><p>BETTER MANDATE THAN PRESIDENT BUSH." YOUNG CALLED ON THE WORLD TO "TAKE </p><p> </p><p>A HARD LOOK AT ZIMBABWE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION BETTER." </p><p>SPEAKING ABOUT RECENT POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE, YOUNG SAID THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01815  061504Z </p><p>IT WAS MINIMAL COMPARED TO THE VIOLENCE CURRENTLY AFFECTING THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) YOUNG ALSO SPOKE ABOUT THE MORALITY OF THE LAND ISSUE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE. HE SAID IT WAS NOT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE FOR 1 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>POPULATION TO OWN 70 PERCENT OF THE LAND. "A LOT OF THE WHITE FOLKS </p><p>HERE WILL GO TO HELL FOR THEIR LACK OF MORAL JUSTIFICATION ON THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE," YOUNG SAID. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: FORMER AMBASSADOR YOUNG HAS A LONG ASSOCIATION WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND IS WELL KNOWN IN ZIMBABWE. IN ADDITION TO HIS TIME </p><p> </p><p>AS U.S. PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UN, YOUNG IS ALSO KNOWN LOCALLY </p><p> </p><p>AS THE LONG-TIME MAYOR OF ATLANTA AND ONE OF THE KEY MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>ATLANTA OLYMPIC COMMITTEE. THE GENERAL PERCEPTION OF YOUNG IS THAT, </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE NO LONGER HOLDS PUBLIC OFFICE, HE STILL HAS SIGNIFICANT </p><p>POLITICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT, BUSINESS AND THE </p><p>MEDIA. YOUNG\'S MESSAGE OF SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S LAND REFORM </p><p>EFFORT WAS CERTAINLY APPRECIATED WITHIN THE RULING PARTY. OTHER SECTORS </p><p> </p><p>OF ZIMBABWEAN SOCIETY MAY BE PUZZLED THAT YOUNG SEEMED UNAWARE OF THE </p><p>BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ZIMBABWE, OR OF ASSAULTS ON THE MEDIA, </p><p>THE JUDICIARY AND OPPOSITION POLITICAL ACTIVISTS. AFTER THE NEWS </p><p>BROADCAST, OPPOSITION POLITICIANS CALLED EMBASSY OFFICERS TO EXPRESS </p><p>THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT YOUNG\'S REMARKS. THEY WERE ASSURED THAT YOUNG HAD </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS PERSONAL VIEWS, WHICH IN NO WAY REFLECTED THE POSITION OF </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01815  061504Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
