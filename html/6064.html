<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 001350 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: WHY THE VOTE WENT SOUTH </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1345 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 418 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 808 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 1325 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 1266 </p><p>     F. ANKARA 1346 </p><p>     G. ANKARA 1341 </p><p>     H. ANKARA 618 </p><p>     I. ANKARA 1303 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Ref A reported the March 1 defeat in </p><p>Parliament of the AK Government\'s petition to permit </p><p>deployment of U.S. troops to Turkey.  A number of factors </p><p>contributed to the outcome, primarily: 1) the secular Turkish </p><p>State\'s fears about USG intention in Iraq; 2) a strong desire </p><p>to bring the Islam-oriented AK to its knees (ref B); and 3) </p><p>the internal political dynamics, rivalries, and ineptitude </p><p>within AK itself.  The AK Government is now badly shaken, AK </p><p>leader Erdogan and P.M. Gul humiliated, and US-Turkish </p><p>relations under severe strain.  Erdogan signaled publicly </p><p>March 2 that the defeated proposal will not be revived, but </p><p>that the Government is considering other unspecified </p><p>alternatives.  Most likely, these will have to wait until at </p><p>least March 11; Erdogan is running for Parliament in the </p><p>March 9 special election in Siirt province, a prelude to his </p><p>eventual assumption of the prime ministership.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>"The Enemy" </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AK and Public Opinion: strong anti-war sentiments </p><p>dominated the Turkish public, media, and held sway in the </p><p>legislature on both sides of the aisle (including AK), </p><p>proving to be too much for an inexperienced AK </p><p>Government/Party to manage.  AK leader Erdogan showed little </p><p>of the decisive leadership on which he prides himself; he did </p><p>too little, too late to sway the voters and his parliamentary </p><p>group.  P.M. Gul\'s high-profile regional diplomatic efforts </p><p>to find a "peaceful solution" to the crisis won AK kudos from </p><p>the voters but also hardened the resolve of anti-war voices </p><p>in the public, the Turkish State, and AK itself.  A number of </p><p>intellectuals across the spectrum had argued that Turkey </p><p>could spike the US war effort with a no vote.  In the </p><p>aftermath, they trumpeted the outcome as a victory for </p><p>democracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Erdogan, Gul and the "AK Parliament": ref C reported </p><p>on the rise of Parliament as an semi-independent foreign </p><p>policy decision making node under the leadership of Speaker </p><p>Bulent Arinc, an AK heavyweight and rival to Erdogan and Gul. </p><p> Arinc\'s outspoken cooperation with both President Sezer and </p><p>the opposition CHP -- which voted en masse to reject -- </p><p>undermined AK party discipline and emboldened fence sitters </p><p>to side against their party leadership.  Minutes after the </p><p>vote, a senior AK member and a well-connected former NSC </p><p>staffer separately observed to us privately that a </p><p>rejectionist appeal by former Islamist P.M. Erbakan to his </p><p>many one-time followers and sympathizers in the AK cadre also </p><p>helped spook some AK members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On behalf of the Party of Ataturk, senior CHP official </p><p>Onder Sav -- who Arinc pointedly granted procedurally dubious </p><p>leeway to speak on substantive issues -- charged that the USG </p><p>in engaging in a "disgusting and shameful war" and declared </p><p>that U.S. ships off Iskenderun belong to "the enemy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A well-connected former M.P. who had visited the floor </p><p>shortly before the vote related to us afterwards that Erdogan </p><p>and Gul, acutely aware of public and AK intramural </p><p>sensitivities and hoping to outflank parliamentary and </p><p>Turkish State rivals, had tried to engineer a close but </p><p>successful vote by allowing a number of their colleagues to </p><p>side with the opposition.  "They miscalculated," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Contacts in AK and elsewhere note that the AK group is now </p><p>wracked with tension and divided, at least for now, between </p><p>Erdogan-Gul and Arinc.  While observers say that this may not </p><p>ultimately lead to the break-up of AK, it poses a serious </p><p>management problem for Erdogan in particular. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Killing Two Birds with One Stone </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Turkish NSC issued a noncommittal statement after its </p><p>Feb. 28 meeting designed, our contacts say, to keep the heat </p><p>on the AK Government and Parliament by depriving them the </p><p>cover of an ecumenical "State" commitment to support the USG </p><p>(ref D).  Moreover, as reported ref E, Turkey\'s powerful </p><p>generals in recent days allowed the impression to build of </p><p>their "concern" that the AK Government was "rushing" </p><p>Parliament to a vote; although they issued a denial, this </p><p>came hard on the heels of months of military criticism of AK </p><p>for foot-dragging on a "political" decision the General Staff </p><p>(TGS) claimed it needed to act.  In fact, the military had </p><p>simultaneously encouraged the Government to make maximal </p><p>demands on the U.S. while intentionally aggravating the </p><p>implementation of the site preparations process, adding </p><p>further tension and pressure to the mix (ref E).  President </p><p>Sezer, who chairs the NSC, reiterated at the 11th hour his </p><p>public challenge to the constitutionality of the AK </p><p>Government\'s petition, teaming up with the ambitious Arinc </p><p>and CHP to press the case in the legislature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In post-vote conversations, contacts echoed what we had </p><p>been picking up before the debate: that Sezer and the </p><p>generals were trying to create the impression that they were </p><p>preventing AK from dragging Turkey into an unpopular war -- </p><p>thereby inducing further hesitation on the part of some AK </p><p>elements.  (Our General Officer contacts at the TGS have been </p><p>telling us for months now that the military clearly sees the </p><p>imperative of total support for the U.S., but that the </p><p>government must step up to its responsibility.  TGS appears </p><p>to have miscalculated.  Our contacts expected a yes vote on </p><p>March 1 and must have been suprised at the outcome.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A senior journalist, the former NSC staffer, and an AK </p><p>M.P. close to Erdogan noted that, in the run-up to the vote, </p><p>the military was focused primarily on undermining Erdogan and </p><p>AK.  The journalist asserted that the military\'s intent was </p><p>"to kill two birds with one stone" -- AK and USG policy in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Kurdish issue was of abiding importance in the </p><p>calculations and the surreptitious political effort led by </p><p>senior elements of the military, the MFA, and its </p><p>bureaucratic allies (refs F-G).  This suspicion about U.S. </p><p>policy toward the Kurds -- regardless of our cooperation and </p><p>statements -- colors the military and bureaucracy views of </p><p>our efforts; they allowed a public campaign (ref H and </p><p>previous) to suggest the USG is working against Turkey with </p><p>the PKK.  The  resurgence of tensions between Turkish </p><p>security forces and ethnic Kurds in southeastern Turkey is, </p><p>according to numerous Kurdish and other contacts -- including </p><p>iconoclastic CHP deputies -- a direct result of the Turkish </p><p>military\'s fears of separatism in the region (ref I and </p><p>previous).  There is an element of the self-fulfilling </p><p>prophecy here; several Turkish Kurdish figures with ties to </p><p>both Islamic (AK) and Kurdish nationalist circles had </p><p>privately criticized USG policy for siding with "Kemalist </p><p>Turkey."  They expressed happiness that the petition failed, </p><p>thereby paving the way for greater USG cooperation with Iraqi </p><p>Kurds -- instead of the Turks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>What\'s Next? </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Erdogan signaled publicly March 2 that the Government </p><p>will not revive the defeated proposal, but is considering </p><p>other unspecified alternatives.  Most likely, any </p><p>reconsideration of U.S. deployments to Turkey will have to </p><p>wait until at least March 11.  On March 9, Erdogan is running </p><p>for Parliament in the special election in Siirt province, a </p><p>prelude to his eventual assumption of the prime ministership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Our Turkish Friends </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The defeat in Parliament is widely understood in </p><p>Ankara as tantamount to de facto vote of no confidence </p><p>against a  Government that has been left badly shaken. </p><p>Though victim of their own leadership shortcomings and </p><p>tactical ineptitude, Erdogan and Gul ultimately stepped up to </p><p>the plate and at considerable risk pushed to support the USG </p><p>-- only to succumb to the pressure of traditional State and </p><p>political rivals and to be publicly humiliated in the </p><p>process.  Many of those rivals are found in the military </p><p>leadership and other official circles that have long </p><p>professed to be the USG\'s best friends in Turkey.  The </p><p>anti-war nexus has scored a tactical political victory while </p><p>risking harm to the bilateral relationship.  Whether that </p><p>damage and drift can be limited or forestalled depends upon </p><p>whether all elements of the corporate Turkish entity -- </p><p>elected Government and unelected State alike -- pull together </p><p>rather than seeking partisan advantage at a watershed moment </p><p>in Turkish history. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
