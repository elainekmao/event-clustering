<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 07 DAMASCUS 01314 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KPRP, PINS, PGOV, PREL, PTER, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p> </p><p>REF:  DAMASCUS 575 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE ONLY POPULAR MOVEMENT EVER TO HAVE </p><p>MOUNTED A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO ASAD\'S REGIME--THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD--HAS NOT RECOVERED FROM ITS INTERNAL </p><p>DIVISIONS AND THE DEVASTATING BLOW SUFFERED AT HAMA. </p><p>THE JANUARY 25 "PARDON" ANNOUNCED FOR CERTAIN MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHER EXILES IS FAR LESS THAN A GENERAL AMNESTY; </p><p>PROBABLY FEW MUSLIM BROTHERS WERE INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATING </p><p>IT AND FEW WILL BENEFIT FROM IT.  THE "PARDON" WAS USE- </p><p>FUL TO ASAD IN BOLSTERING HIS IMAGE OF "BENEVOLENCE" </p><p>IN THE PERIOD LEADING UP TO THE FEBRUARY 10 REFERENDUM. </p><p>IT TESTIFIES TO THE CONTINUED WEAK STATE OF THE SYRIAN </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS:  DEFEATED, DIVIDED, & DISCREDITED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  SINCE THE MASSIVE ARRESTS THAT BEGAN IN DECEMBER </p><p>1981 AND THE DEMOLITION OF HAMA IN FEBRUARY 1982, THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HAS BEEN TAME.  IN THE INTERIM, </p><p>ASAD\'S INTERNAL PROBLEMS HAVE DERIVED FROM AN ENTIRELY </p><p>DIFFERENT AREA--HIS OWN LAPSE OF HEALTH AND HIS BROTHER </p><p>RIF\'AT\'S GRAB FOR POWER.  HAMA IS USUALLY VIEWED AS THE </p><p>WHOLE EXPLANATION FOR THE MUSLIM BROTHERS\' FALL, BUT </p><p>THE EXPLANATION IS MORE COMPLEX. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  LONG BEFORE HAMA, IN THE SEVENTIES, THE SYRIAN </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SPLIT INTO AT LEAST THREE "TENDENCIES." </p><p>THERE WAS, AND STILL IS, A GROUP CENTERED AT AACHEN IN </p><p>WEST GERMANY, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF \'ISAM AL-\'ATTAR, </p><p>WHO WAS EXILED FROM SYRIA IN 1964.  AS EARLY AS 1970 </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS IN SYRIA DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED A </p><p>LEADER CLOSER TO HOME, AND \'ATTAR HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY </p><p>IRRELEVANT.  AT PRESENT, ACCORDING TO OUR GERMAN </p><p>COLLEAGUES, \'ATTAR IS OLD AND AILING, HE IS STILL IN </p><p>AACHEN, AND HE HAS BECOME ONLY A RELIGIOUS "THINKER." </p><p>HE SEEMS NO LONGER TO HAVE MUCH OF A FOLLOWING. </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>5.  LEADERSHIP OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS CAME TO BE </p><p>DIVIDED INTO POLITICAL AND MILITARY "TENDENCIES."  THE </p><p>POLITICAL TENDENCY WAS, AND STILL IS, LED BY A GROUP </p><p>OF OLDER MEN (BORN IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES) </p><p>SUCH AS \'ADNAN SA\'D AL-DIN, SA\'ID HAWWA, AND THE AL- </p><p>BAYANUNI BROTHERS.  THESE MEN MAY BE IN BAGHDAD OR </p><p>THEY MAY MOVE BETWEEN BAGHDAD AND AMMAN.  THE "POLITICAL" </p><p>GROUP FALLS INTO THE TRADITIONAL MOLD OF THE FOUNDER </p><p>OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, THE EGYPTIAN HASAN AL-BANNA: </p><p>MEN WHO ARE "FUNDAMENTALIST" IN WISHING TO CREATE A </p><p>STATE BUILT ON THE KORAN BUT WHO CAN ACCEPT CERTAIN </p><p>WESTERN HUMANISTIC AND PARLIAMENTARY IDEAS.  IN THE </p><p>EARLY SEVENTIES, THESE MEN EMBRACED THE IDEA OF MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS ("JIHAD"), IN OPPOSITION TO THE LESS </p><p>MILITARISTIC ORIENTATION OF \'ISAM AL-\'ATTAR, BUT THEY </p><p>WERE SUBSEQENTLY UPSTAGED BY THE FAR MORE ACTIVE </p><p>MILITARISM OF THE "MILITARY TENDENCY" THAT DEVELOPED IN </p><p>THE MID-SEVENTIES.  (IRONICALLY, \'ATTAR IS TODAY MORE </p><p>IDEOLOGICALLY ALLIED WITH THE MILITARY TENDENCY THAN </p><p>THE POLITICAL TENDENCY.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE "MILITARY TENDENCY" FROM THE BEGINNING HAS BEEN </p><p>LED BY A MUCH YOUNGER GROUP OF MEN.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION </p><p>IN THE MID-SEVENTIES, IT HAS BEEN KNOWN AS AL-TALI\'A </p><p>AL-MUQATILA LIL-MUJAHIDIN (THE FIGHTING VANGUARD OF </p><p>WARRIORS).  IT HAS BEEN WILLING TO RESORT TO ANY FORM </p><p>OF TERROR (E.G., BLOWING UP THE CADETS\' ARTILLERY </p><p>SCHOOL IN ALEPPO IN 1980, WITH OVER FIFTY KILLED).  ITS </p><p>LEADERS HAVE REJECTED WESTERN IDEAS, ANY FORM OF </p><p>COMPROMISE WITH SECULAR MOVEMENTS, AND ANY MERCY FOR </p><p>ALAWIS.  IN THEIR FANATICISM, THEY FORM A SUNNI ANALOGUE </p><p>TO THE KHOMEINISTS.  THIS GROUP\'S EARLY LEADERS WERE ONE </p><p>BY ONE KILLED BY ASAD\'S SECURITY FORCES WHEN </p><p>ASAD BEGAN TO STEP UP HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERS IN 1979-80.  THE LEADER--OR "CALIPH," AS HE </p><p>WAS CALLED BY HIS ADHERENTS--WHO SUCCEEDED THEM WAS </p><p>\'ADNAN \'UQLA (BORN 1950). </p><p> </p><p>7.  FOR A TIME, BEGINNING WITH THE FORMATION OF AN </p><p>"ISLAMIC FRONT" AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE "MANIFESTO </p><p>OF THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION OF SYRIA" IN NOVEMBER 1980 </p><p>(SIGNED BY \'ADNAN SA\'D AL-DIN, SA\'ID HAWWA, AND \'ALI AL- </p><p>BAYANUNI--THE LAST NAMED AS THE ISLAMIC FRONT\'S </p><p>"SECRETARY GENERAL"), THERI WAS GREATER COOPERATION </p><p>WITHIN THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  \'ISAM AL-\'ATTAR </p><p>JOINED THE FRONT, AND \'UQLA AND THE "POLITICAL TENDENCY" </p><p>HELD NEGOTIATIONS TO TRY TO PATCH UP THIIR DIFFERENCES. </p><p>IT APPEARS THAT THEY MAY EVEN HAVE COORDINATED TO TRY </p><p>TO EFFECT A COUP AGAINST ASAD, WHICH THEY FORESAW </p><p>WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY MASS UPRISINGS THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  (THEY ALSO HOPED FOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE-- </p><p>FROM IRAQ, IN PARTICULAR.)  THE MUSLIM BROTHERS </p><p>APPARENTLY HAD SYMPATHIZERS IN MANY QUARTERS OF THE </p><p>REGIME, INCLUDING IN HIGH PLACES IN THE ARMED FORCES. </p><p>PRESS REPORTING OF THE PERIOD SUGGESTS THAT COORDINATION </p><p>AND PLANNING WERE, HOWEVER, LACKING.  ASAD\'S SECURITY </p><p>FORCES GOT WIND OF THE PLOTTING AND BEGAN A MAJOR </p><p>ARREST CAMPAIGN BY THE END OF 1981.  FOUR HUNDRED OFFICERS </p><p>WERE REPORTEDLY ARRESTED IN JANUARY, 1982.  BY THE TIME </p><p>ASAD\'S MEN LOCATED THE MUSLIM BROTHERS\' HEADQUARTERS IN </p><p>HAMA, ON FEBRUARY 2, 1.82, ASAD\'S MEN HAD PROBABLY </p><p>ALREADY BROKEN THE BACK OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERS\' </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE REGIME.  THE MUSLIM BROTHERS </p><p>IN HAMA, FORCED TO MAKE A STAND OR FACE ARREST AND </p><p>EXECUTION, OVERWHELMED THE ARMED FORCE THAT ASAD </p><p>ORGINALLY SENT IN TO HAMA, AND A SIEGE OF SEVERAL WEEKS </p><p>ENSUED, RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF DEATHS.  ( A TALI\'A </p><p>SOURCE IN SEPTEMBER 1982 CLAIMED THAT 6,000 OF ASAD\'S </p><p>FORCES, 400 "MUJAHIDIN," AND 15,000 CIVILIANS WERE </p><p>KILLED.  MORE RECENTLY, SYRIANS ARE WONT TO CITE VERY </p><p>MUCH HIGHER FIGURES.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  TALI\'A AND THE "POLITICAL TENDENCY" HAD ALREADY </p><p>BROKEN OFF THEIR NEGOTIATIONS IN DECEMBER 1981, AT </p><p>THE TIME WHEN THE MAJOR ARRESTS HAD BEGUN, TWO MONTHS </p><p>BEFORE HAMA.  HAMA ITSELF, THEREFORE, WAS NOT THE CAUSE </p><p>OF THE FINAL RUPTURE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS STRONG FEELING </p><p>AMONG THE "POLITICAL TENDENCY" THAT THE TALI\'A BOTCHED </p><p>THE JOB IN HAMA.  THE RUPTURE BECAME OFFICIAL WHEN THE </p><p>"POLITICAL TENDENCY" JOINED THE NEWLY CONSTITUTED </p><p>"NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR THE LIBERATION OF SYRIA" IN </p><p>MARCH 1982, WITH NINETEEN OTHER OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS </p><p>OR INDIVIDUALS,MOST OF THEM SECULAR AND CENTERED IN </p><p>IRAQ.  SA\'D AL-DIN REPRESENTS THE ISLAMIC FRONT IN THE </p><p>NATIONAL ALLIANCE, WHICH INCLUDES THE PRO-IRAQI WING </p><p>OF THE SYRIAN BA\'TH PARTY (MICHEL \'AFLAQ), THE ARAB </p><p>SOCIALIST MOVEMENT (LED BY \'AFLAQ\'S ERSTWHILE ALLY </p><p>AKRAM AL-HAWRANI), NASSERISTS, AND INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS </p><p>FORMER SYRIAN DICTATOR AMIN AL-HAFIZ. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE FORMATION OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE SIGNALED </p><p>HOW FAR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HAD FALLEN.  NOT ONLY HAD </p><p>IT LOST MUCH OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE PLANTED IN THE REGIME </p><p>AND MUCH OF ITS FIGHTING FORCE, IT HAD BECOME </p><p>IRRECONCILABLY SPLIT AND THE POLITICAL WING HAD SULLIED </p><p>ITSELF BY ASSOCIATING WITH GROUPS ALIEN TO THE IDEA OF AN </p><p>ISLAMIC STATE AND BY PUTTING ITSELF SQUARELY INTO THE </p><p>GRIP OF THE IRAQI REGIME.  IT IS LITTLE WONDER THAT IN </p><p>THE PERIOD AFTER THOSE DEVASTATING MONTHS, DECEMBER 1981 </p><p>TO MARCH 1982, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OR NO  TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IN </p><p>SYRIA, AND INDEED, LITTLE APPARENT POLITICAL ACTIVITY. </p><p>(THE ISRAELI INVASION OF LEBANON IN JUNE 1982 WAS </p><p>ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, SINCE THAT INVASION HAD </p><p>THE EFFECT OF BINDING THE SYRIAN POPULACE AGAINST THE </p><p>PERCEIVED ENEMY, AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITY--EVEN </p><p>LEAVING ASIDE THE DISCREDITING TRAUMA OF HAMA--WOULD </p><p>HAVE FOUND LESS POPULAR SYMPATHY THAN NORMALLY.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p>HAS EVER RECEIVED EXTENSIVE EXTERNAL SUPPORT.  WITH </p><p>ITS INTERNAL STRUCTURE DISRUPTED AND ITS NAME BLACKENED </p><p>AMONG ITS OWN PURISTS AND AMONG THE SYRIAN POPULACE AT </p><p>LARGE, IT PRESUMABLY HAS HAD TO LOOK EVEN MORE ACTIVELY </p><p>FOR EXTERNAL SUPPORT.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>CONSTRAINTS THAT CAUSE US TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE NOT </p><p>HAD GREAT SUCCESS: </p><p> </p><p>--SECULAR, BA\'THI IRAQ WELCOMED AT LEAST SOME OF THE </p><p>LEADERS OF THE POLITICAL   TENDENCY "WITH OPEN ARMS." </p><p>BUT IT CLOSED THE DOOR TO THE TALI\'A.  (\'UQLA COULD NOT </p><p>FIND REFUGE THERE.  ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS HE WAS </p><p>ARRESTED WHEN TRYING TO SNEAK BACK INTO SYRIA EITHER </p><p>IN 1983 OR 1984; HE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM RECENTLY.) </p><p>A JORDANIAN COLLEAGUE SAYS THAT IRAQ "MAY BE" TRAINING </p><p>THE MUSLIM BROTHERS NOW, BUT ON A LIMITED BASIS.  THE </p><p>IRAQI REGIME APPARENTLY WILL NOT COUNTENANCE </p><p>ANY OPERATIONS NOT TOTALLY UNDER ITS CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>--JORDAN MAINTAINS AN INTELLIGENCE LINK TO THE BROTHER- </p><p>HOOD AND REPORTEDLY ALLOWS ALL FACTIONS OF THE SYRIAN </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, BUT IT WOULD BE </p><p>EXTREMELY NERVOUS ABOUT ANY OPERATION AGAINST SYRIA, </p><p>WHICH WAS SEEN TO BE PLANNED OR TAKE PLACE FROM JORDAN. </p><p>IT APPARENTLY GIVES LITTLE ACTIVE ASSISTANCE, AND IT IS </p><p>SUSPICIOUS OF ALL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>--ARAFAT\'S PLO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF COOPERATION WITH </p><p>THE MUSLIM BROTHERS (ONE OF MANY REASONS FOR ASAD\'S </p><p>ANTIPATHY), BUT ARAFAT\'S ABILITY TO BE HELPFUL IS PROBABLY </p><p>NOT VERY GREAT.  ARAFAT AND OTHER FOUNDERS OF FATAH WERE </p><p>THEMSELVES MUSLIM BROTHERS , AND FEDAYEEN AND MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERS TRAINED TOGETHER IN JORDAN BEFORE THE 1970 </p><p>CIVIL WAR.  MORE RECENTLY, ARAFAT AND SHAYKH SHA\'BAN, </p><p>TAWHID LEADER IN TRIPOLI, LEBANON, WERE CLOSE ALLIES </p><p>UNTIL ARAFAT WAS DRIVEN OUT IN DECEMBER 1983.  (SHA\'BAN, </p><p>WE BELIEVE, IS A MUSLIM BROTHER, AND SOME OF THE SYRIAN </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO FLED AFTER HAMA TOOK REFUGE IN </p><p>TRIPOLI AND FORM A PART OF THE TAWHID.)  ARAFAT\'S DIRECT </p><p>ASSISTANCE--AT LEAST IN THE FORM OF ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN ORGANIZATION AND TRAINING--WAS PROBABLY DISRUPTED </p><p>BY HIS OUSTER FROM TRIPOLI AND WE ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO </p><p>THE DEGREE OF CONTINUING COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>--IRAN IS ANATHEMA TO THE POLITICAL TENDECY, BOTH </p><p>BECAUSE OF ITS SUPPORT FOR THE ASAD/ALAWI REGIME </p><p>AND BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL TENDENCY\'S ASSOCIATION </p><p>WITH IRAQ.  IRAN\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH TALI\'A IS MORE </p><p>NUANCED.  TALI\'A REVILES IRAN FOR ITS SUPPORT FOR ASAD, </p><p>BUT THERE IS A COMMON FANATICISM AND THERE MAY BE A </p><p>REALIZATION WITH THE TALI\'A THAT IRAN\'S RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH ASAD IS PURELY TACTICAL AND THEREFORE THAT IRAN </p><p>IS NOT "BEYOND REDEMPTION." </p><p> </p><p>--SAUDI ARABIA IS SIMILARLY REVILED FOR ITS ENORMOUS </p><p>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ASAD REGIME,  BUT WE HEAR </p><p>PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT RIYADH HAS ALSO PROVIDED </p><p>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND REFUGE TO CERTAIN OF THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS.  SAUDI DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS HERE </p><p>STOUTLY DENY ANY ASSOCIATION WITH ANY SYRIAN MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERS, AVERRING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN </p><p>AND MUCH TO LOSE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE ALMOST </p><p>CERTAINLY MUSLIM BROTHERS IN MECCA, WHOSE PRESENCE IS </p><p>TOLERATED BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS UNDERPINNINGS AND </p><p>TIES TO THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE "PARDON":  PUBLICITY PLOY AND SIGN OF BROTHERHOOD </p><p>WEAKNESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  INTO THE APPARENT  THREE-YEAR VOID IN </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITY, ASAD HAS NOW INJECTED HIS </p><p>LIMITED PARDON OF JANUARY 25.  SOME SYRIANS AND </p><p>DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED SURPRISE TO US </p><p>THAT ASAD DID NOT MAKE SOME "GRAND GESTURE" SOME MONTHS </p><p>AGO, BEGINNING AT THE TIME OF HIS RECOVERY IN HEALTH </p><p>AND RIF\'AT\'S EXILE.  HOWEVER, ASAD PROBABLY NEEDED ALL </p><p>OF 1984 TO BUILD BACK FROM THE CRISIS BROUGHT ON BY </p><p>HIS HEART ATTACK, AS SHOWN BY HIS CONTINUAL DEFERRAL </p><p>OF THE EIGHTH REGIONAL CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>12.  THE "PARDON" IS FAR FROM A GENERAL AMNESTY: </p><p> </p><p>--IT DECLARES:  "CONTACTS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HELD </p><p>BETWEEN US AND THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD VANGUARD ORGANIZA- </p><p>TION (TANZIM AL\'TALI\'A) LEADERSHIP ABROAD."  THE NAME, </p><p>"TANZIM AL\'TALI\'A," IS NOT THE SAME AS "AL-TALI\'A AL- </p><p>MUQATILA LIL -MUJAHIDIN," THE OFFICIAL NAME THAT HAS </p><p>ALWAYS BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE "MILITARY TENDENCY." </p><p> </p><p>--"ABROAD" IMPLIES THAT THE AMNESTY IS INTENDED ONLY FOR </p><p>EXILES, NOT FOR MUSLIM BROTHERS IN PRISON IN SYRIA. </p><p>(A TALI\'A SPOKESMAN IN 1982 CLAIMED THAT THERE WERE </p><p>10,000  MUSLIM BROTHERS IN JAIL IN SYRIA.  ALL OF OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS ON THE SUBJECT ASSERT THAT THERE ARE </p><p>"THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS" OF SYRIANS IN JAIL, ACCUSED </p><p>OF BEING OR ASSOCIATING WITH MUSLIM BROTHERS, DATING </p><p>FROM THE LATE SEVENTIES BUT ESPECIALLY FROM THE HAMA </p><p>PERIOD.  INDEED, IT IS COMMON TO MEET SYRIANS WHO HAVE </p><p>SOME FAMILY MEMBER, OR WHO KNOW OTHERS WHO HAVE SOME </p><p>FAMILY MEMBER, IN JAIL UNDER ACCUSATIONS RELATING TO </p><p>THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  10,000 SEEMS A FAIR ESTIMATE-- </p><p>AND A VERY LARGE NUMBER FOR A SMALL COUNTRY.) </p><p> </p><p>--IT DECLARES THAT "THIS LEADERSHIP" HAS EXPRESSED "NEW </p><p>CONVICTIONS" RECOGNIZING THE PERFIDY OF THE "PLOT </p><p>CONCOCTED AGAINST SYRIA" BY "THOSE TRADING IN THE NAME </p><p>OF RELIGION."  THIS FORMULATION SUGGESTS THAT MUSLIM </p><p>FANATICS--IF INDEED THE TALI\'A--HAD A CHANGE OF HEART, </p><p>INCLUDING A RECOGNITION THAT THEIR PREVIOUS ACTS </p><p>AGAINST THE ASAD REGIME IN THE NAME OF ISLAM WERE </p><p>ACTUALLY CONTRARY TO ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>--IT DECLARES THAT "THIS LEADERSHIP" HAS EXPRESSED, IN </p><p>ITS NAME AND "THE NAME OF MANY OF THE BROTHERHOOD </p><p>BASES," THE DESIRE TO "RETURN TO THE HOMELAND" AND THAT </p><p>"THIS PARDON WILL BE APPLICABLE TO EVERYONE WHO </p><p>RETURNS TO HIS HOMELAND WITH AN OPEN HEART."  IT </p><p>SUGGESTS, THUS, THAT THE PARDON--WHILE ONLY ADDRESSED TO </p><p>EXILES--IS SOMEHOW ADDRESSED NOT TO ONE GROUP ONLY, </p><p>BUT TO ALL BROTHERHOOD "BASES" AND "EVERYONE" WHO </p><p>SOMEHOW "PROVES" HIS ALLEGIANCE AND CHANGE OF HEART. </p><p> </p><p>--FINALLY, IT DECLARES THAT "SOME OF THESE CITIZENS </p><p>HAVE ALREADY RETURNED" UNDER A "SPECIAL PARDON FROM </p><p>HAFIZ AL-ASAD." </p><p> </p><p>13.  ON THE VERY SAME DAY AS THIS "PARDON," THE FINAL </p><p>DECLARATION OF THE EIGHTH REGIONAL CONGRESS WAS ISSUED, </p><p>CARRYING AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT MESSAGE.  DURING THE </p><p>CONGRESS, WE HAD HEARD THAT TWO "SECRET" SESSIONS </p><p>DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, AND </p><p>THESE REPORTS WERE BORNE OUT IN THE FINAL DECLARATION. </p><p> </p><p>--"DURING ITS STUDY OF THE DOMESTIC SITUATION, THE </p><p>CONGRESS DISCUSSED THE PLOT OF THE AGENT MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD GANG, WHICH HAS SOUGHT TO IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>PLANS OF IMPERIALISM AND SOME OF ITS TOOLS IN THE </p><p>REGION THROUGH BASES OF SUPPORT, SUPPLIES, TRAINING, </p><p>AND HELP FROM JORDAN AND IRAQ.  THE CONGRESS ALSO </p><p>REVIEWED THE MEASURES TAKEN TO LIQUIDATE THAT AGENT </p><p>GANG AND TO PURSUE ITS ELEMENTS...IT PRAISED THE MEASURES </p><p>EXERTED...TO LIQUIDATE THIS GANG AND TO FOIL THE </p><p>IMPERIALIST-ZIONIST SCHEMES IT WAS IMPLEMENTING." </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>THERE IS NOT A WORD OF LENIENCY IN THIS FORMULATION.  IN </p><p>EFFECT, IT IS A STATEMENT THAT IMPLIES THAT HAMA WAS </p><p>NECESSARY, THE REGIME IS NOT SORRY ABOUT IT, AND IT </p><p>WILL DO IT AGAIN IF NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THUS THIS "PARDON" IS HIGHLY SUSPECT ON SEVERAL </p><p>COUNTS: </p><p> </p><p>--IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE THOUSANDS OF MUSLIM BROTHERS </p><p>WHO ARE IN PRISON.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE VERY </p><p>MANY MUSLIM BROTHER EXILES BEING LURED BACK TO  SYRIA </p><p>WITHOUT A DEMONSTRATION THAT OTHERS, NOT SO FORTUNATE </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FLEE, WOULD NOT ALSO BE FORGIVEN. </p><p>IN FACT, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW REPORTS THAT SOME OF </p><p>THOSE IN PRISON--A "SMALL NUMBER," OR "MORE THAN A </p><p>HUNDRED," OR "FIVE HUNDRED"--HAVE BEEN RELEASED </p><p>(ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, MOST OF THESE WERE WOMEN). </p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, MOST OF OUR CONTACTS KNOW OF NO </p><p>PROGRESS WHATSOEVER ON RELEASE OF MUSLIM BROTHERS, AND </p><p>THEIR INQUIRIES INTO THE FATE OF RELATIVES CONTINUE </p><p>TO MEET THE SAME DEADLY SILENCE AS HAS PREVAILED FOR </p><p>THREE YEARS.  BY THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ACCOUNT, THERE </p><p>SCARCELY SEEMS TO DE THE KIND OF DEMONSTRATION OF </p><p>"GOOD INTENTIONS" THAT MUSLIM BROTHERS WITH A HEALTHY </p><p>INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION WOULD REQUIRE BEFORE </p><p>CONTEMPLATING A RETURN TO SYRIA.  (THE REGIME WOULD HAVE </p><p>A MAJOR PROBLEM IN GRANTING A GENERAL AMNESTY.  MANY </p><p>OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO WERE IMPRISONED HAVE </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY "DISAPPEARED"--ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, </p><p>SEVERAL WERE INTENTIONALLY "RELEASED" FROM PALMYRA </p><p>PRISON AND THEN HUNTED DOWN AND KILLED--AND OTHERS </p><p>TORTURED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE </p><p>"PRESENTABLE" TO THE PUBLIC.) </p><p> </p><p>--THE "PARDON" IS EXTREMELY VAGUE ON HOW AN EXILE IS </p><p>MEANT TO "PROVE" HIS SINCERITY AND ALLEGIANCE, ANOTHER </p><p>FACTOR THAT WOULD DISSUADE "HOMESICK" EXILES. </p><p> </p><p>--IT TALKS ABOUT THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD VANGUARD </p><p>ORGANIZATION LEADERSHIP ABROAD, RATHER THAN THE LEADER- </p><p>SHIP OF THE FIGHTING VANGUARD OF THE WARRIORS. </p><p>"VANGUARD" (TALI\'A) IS A COMMONLY USED CATCHWORD IN </p><p>SYRIAN POLITICAL PARLANCE.  THE SYRIANS THUS MAY NOT BE </p><p>REFERRING TO THE SAME GROUP; THEY MAY EVEN BE </p><p>INTENTIONALLY USING PART OF THE NAME IN AN EFFORT TO </p><p>DISCREDIT THE "MILITARY TENDENCY" FURTHER.  IT IS </p><p>NOTEWORTHY THAT IF \'ADNAN \'UQLA, THE TALI\'A "CALIPH," </p><p>IS IN FACT IN A SYRIAN PRISON, THE SYRIANS HAVE </p><p>SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED HIM IN THEIR FORMULATION. </p><p> </p><p>--FINALLY, THE VERY NATURE OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERS--AND ESPECIALLY THE WELL-KNOWN FANATICISM OF </p><p>THE TALI\'A--IS SUCH AS TO SUGGEST THAT VERY FEW OF THEIR </p><p>MEMBERS, MUCH LESS THEIR LEADERS, WOULD ACCEPT THE </p><p>HUMILIATION OF KOWTOWING TO HAFIZ AL-ASAD. </p><p> </p><p>15.  NEVERTHELESS,  WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF REPORTS THAT </p><p>SYRIAN SECURITY OFFICIALS DID CONDUCT NEGOTIATIONS WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLING ITSELF </p><p>"TALI\'A"--MEANT TO BE THE TALI\'A OF \'ADNAN \'UQLA--A </p><p>PROCESS THAT SUPPOSEDLY BEGAN WITH THE INTERVENTION OF </p><p>SA\'ID SHA\'BAN AND POSSIBLY THE IRANIANS.  WE EVEN HAVE </p><p>A REPORT THAT SOME "FEW HUNDRED" TALI\'A MEMBERS HAVE </p><p>RETURNED TO SYRIA FROM REFUGE IN SAUDI ARABIA, THANKS </p><p>TO THE INTERVENTION OF CROWN PRINCE \'ABDALLAH, WHEN HE </p><p>WAS IN DAMASCUS JANUARY 21-FEBRUARY 1 (AND POSSIBLY </p><p>ALSO DURING HIS SEPTEMBER 1984 VISIT), AND THAT TALI\'A </p><p>MAY EVEN JOIN THE SYRIAN "NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE FRONT"* </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>16.  IF THESE REPORTS HAVE ANY TRUTH TO THEM, THEY </p><p>ARE THE STRONGEST INDICATION YET OF THE LOW STATE TO </p><p>WHICH THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS HAVE FALLEN.  IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1982, AN UNNAMED SPOKESMAN FOR TALI\'A, IN </p><p>AN INTERVIEW WITH LE MATIN, POINTED A FINGER AT THE </p><p>"POLITICAL TENDENCY," DISDAINFULLY ACCUSING ITS LEADERS </p><p>(SA\'D AL-DIN ET AL) OF BEING ON THE VERGE OF JOINING A </p><p>COALITION WITH ASAD.  NOW IT MAY BE THAT TALI\'A ITSELF, </p><p>OR SOME ELEMENTS IN IT, HAVE DONE JUST THAT. </p><p> </p><p>17.  GIVEN THE RELIABILITY OF THESE RECENT REPORTS, WE </p><p>ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT A SMALL OR FRINGE ELEMENT </p><p>OF THE TALI\'A, OR AN ELEMENT OF MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO </p><p>HAVE ASSUMED  THE NAME, HAS ENGAGED IN THESE NEGOTIA- </p><p>TIONS WITH THE SYRIANS.  THE SHA\'BAN CONNECTION IS </p><p>PLAUSIBLE--INDEED, OUR SAUDI AND JORDANIAN DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CONTACTS HERE, WITHOUT PROMPTING, INDICATED TO US THAT </p><p>THERE WERE NUMEROUS "MEN FROM TRIPOLI" MILLING ABOUT </p><p>IN DAMASCUS IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>THE "PARDON," AND THEY BELIEVE "TRIPOLI" WAS WHAT IT </p><p>WAS ALL ABOUT.  A SWEDISH DIPLOMAT HERE, A LONG-TIME </p><p>FOLLOWER OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS (APPARENTLY </p><p>THERE ARE MANY OF THEM IN SWEDEN), INFORMS US ALSO </p><p>THAT HE HAD HEARD, AT THE TIME OF SHA\'BAN\'S REMARK- </p><p>ABLE VISIT TO DAMASCUS IN SEPTEMBER 1984, THAT SHA\'BAN </p><p>HAD RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE RETURN TO SYRIA OF SOME </p><p>OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE </p><p>IN TRIPOLI.  (THE SWEDE ALSO SAYS THAT SHA\'BAN, A </p><p>MORTAL ENEMY OF ASAD, ONLY AGREED TO COME TO DAMASCUS, </p><p>AT IRANIAN PRESIDENT KHAMENEI\'S URGING, WHEN </p><p>KHAMENEI AGREED TO KEEP AN IRANIAN MINISTER IN TRIPOLI </p><p>AND ASAD AGREED TO SEND A HIGH-RANKING SYRIAN OFFICIAL </p><p>TO TRIPOLI AS GUARANTORS OF SHA\'BAN\'S SAFE RETURN.) </p><p>SA\'ID SHA\'BAN MADE HIS SECOND VISIT TO SYRIA ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 20, THOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD THAT THE </p><p>LATTER VISIT HAD A MUSLIM BROTHERS CONNECTION. </p><p> </p><p>18.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE "PARDON" FOR MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERS FORMED A PART OF THE PRE-REFERENDUM </p><p>PUBLICITY BUILD-UP.  IT IS CLEAR THAT ASAD WANTED TO </p><p>GO INTO THE REFERENDUM WITH HIS "RELIGIOUS FLANK" AS </p><p>WELL COVERED AS POSSIBLE.  IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO </p><p>THE REFERENDUM ON FEBRUARY 10, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRESS </p><p>WAS REPLETE WITH HEADLINES OF ACCLAIM FOR ASAD FROM </p><p>EACH OF THE PRINCIPAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN SYRIA, </p><p>INCLUDING EVEN A JOINT MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN DECLARATION. </p><p>ASAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN CAREFUL TO APPEAR TO BE A DEVOUT </p><p>MUSLIM--DESPITE BEING AN ALAWI AND THUS DESPISED BY </p><p>DEVOUT MUSLIMS--AND HE HAS ALWAYS TROTTED OUT CHRISTIAN </p><p>LEADERS AT TIMES WHEN IT WAS IMPORTANT TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>NATIONAL UNITY; BUT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN QUITE SO MUCH OF </p><p>IT ALL AT ONCE. </p><p> </p><p>19.  BUT HIS NEED FOR THIS "PARDON" AT THIS TIME GOES </p><p>DEEPER.  HAMA CONTINUES AS A VERY PRESENT, VERY </p><p>HORRIBLE NATIONAL MEMORY.  NOTHING LIKE HAMA HAD EVER </p><p>OCCURRED IN LIVING MEMORY.  (JAMAL PASHA\'S HUPPRESSION </p><p>OF CHRISTIAN MINORITIES INVOLVED TURKISH BUTCHERY </p><p>OF CHRISTIANS, MOSTLY ARMENIANS AND MARONITES--THUS </p><p>THIS IS NOT A MEMORY OF SYRIANS BUTCHERING FELLOW </p><p>SYRIANS.)  WE BELIEVE THAT ASAD SOUGHT TO GO INTO HIS </p><p>THIRD TERM "CLEANSED," WITH THE HORROR OF HAMA PUT </p><p>BEHIND HIM.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE MEMORY OF HAMA HAS </p><p>ITS UTILITY, IN REMINDING THE PEOPLE THAT ASAD IS </p><p>WILLING TO BE UNIMAGINABLY TOUGH WHEN HE HAS TO BE. </p><p>THUS, HE GAVE DOUBLE, APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY </p><p>MESSAGES--THE "PARDON," AND THE EIGHTH CONGRESS FINAL </p><p>DECLARATION ON THE SAME DAY STRESSING CONTINUED TOUGH- </p><p>NESS.  INDEED, THE "PARDON" IS ALSO QUITE TOUGH IN </p><p>ITS CONDEMNATION OF THOSE "TRADING IN THE NAME OF </p><p>RELIGION" AND "DISTORTING  THE NOBLE RELIGION." </p><p>ASAD SEEKS TO GIVE AN IMAGE OF BEING "BENEVOLENT," </p><p>"TOUGH," AND THE "UPHOLDER OF RELIGION" (THOUGH ALAWI) </p><p>ALL AT THE SAME TIME. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>20.
