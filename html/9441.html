<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004389 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, IZ, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN FM MUASHER AND RUSSIAN FM IVANOV DISCUSS </p><p>ROADMAP, IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 04361 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 04313 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires David Hale for Reasons 1.5 (B)&(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Charge and PolCouns met July 15 with Ali al-Ayed, </p><p>Director of Foreign Minister Muasher\'s Private Office, and </p><p>Samer Dabbas, the Private Office Iraq action officer.  In </p><p>addition to discussions on the formation of the Iraqi </p><p>Governing Council (reported ref a), Ayed gave a read-out on </p><p>Muasher\'s July 14 talks with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov. </p><p> According to Ali, Ivanov recounted his recent meetings with </p><p>both PNA Prime Minister Abu Mazen and PNA President Arafat </p><p>and said that in his opinion, the two Palestinian leaders </p><p>differed on the means to implement the roadmap, rather than </p><p>on the roadmap itself.  Ivanov recognized, however, that </p><p>Arafat was trying to &maneuver8 in order to gain position </p><p>over Abu Mazen. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) For his part, Muasher raised with Ivanov his proposed </p><p>&Arafat package,8 i.e., his plan for the international </p><p>community to accommodate Arafat so as to prevent Arafat from </p><p>undermining Abu Mazen, and his ambitious ideas to push </p><p>forward the roadmap.  (Note: all these proposals were </p><p>reported ref b notal.)  Muasher  pressed Russia to work with </p><p>the Quartet to gain concessions from Israel on:  a) release </p><p>of Palestinian prisoners; b) dismantling of Israeli </p><p>settlements; and c) improved living conditions for the </p><p>Palestinian people.  Muasher further asked Ivanov to work on </p><p>the Syrians to be "more proactive on their support of the </p><p>roadmap8 and to stop seeking a separate roadmap for </p><p>Syria/Lebanon. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While talk of the peace process had dominated their </p><p>discussions, Ayed noted that Muasher and Ivanov had briefly </p><p>discussed Iraq, agreeing to coordinate statements at a July </p><p>14 joint press conference cautiously welcoming the new </p><p>Governing Council.  At the conference, Ivanov described the </p><p>Council as &a step on the right track,8 although he also </p><p>remarked that, &This step must be followed by others which </p><p>would allow the creation of a legitimate authority in Iraq.8 </p><p> Muasher similarly deemed the Council as &a positive step, </p><p>hopefully towards the formation of a government elected by </p><p>the Iraqi people and that would transcend sectarian </p><p>representation.8 </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
