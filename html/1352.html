(C) SUMMARY: THE UN RESIDENT COORDINATOR IN HARARE, </p><p>VICTOR ANGELO, HOSTED A FOLLOW-UP MEETING OF THE LOCAL </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY ON NOVEMBER 9.  THE PURPOSE WAS TO ALLOW </p><p>THE DONOR COMMUNITY TO RESPOND TO THE DRAFT UNDP MISSION </p><p>REPORT ON THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN ZIMBABWE, AS WELL </p><p>AS TO DISCUSS HOW THE UNDP AND DONOR COMMUNITY COULD </p><p>MOVE THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) </p><p>AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN A </p><p>POSITIVE DIRECTION WITHOUT REWARDING LAWLESSNESS.  THE </p><p>RESIDENT COORDINATOR ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MUCH OF THE </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE MISSION REPORT REGARDING HISTORICAL </p><p>INACCURACY AND A BIAS AGAINST THE ROLE OF THE DONOR </p><p>COMMUNITY IN THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN ZIMBABWE WAS AN </p><p>ACCURATE CRITIQUE OF THE REPORT.  A MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>DONOR REPRESENTATIVES AGAIN EMPHASIZED THAT THEIR </p><p>GOVERNMENTS WILL NOT SUPPORT THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE UNTIL THE GOZ RESPECTS THE RULE OF LAW AND ENDS </p><p>THE ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF COMMERCIAL FARMS.  THE DANISH </p><p>AMBASSADOR TOLD THE GROUP THAT THE DANISH MINISTER FOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION HAD MADE CLEAR TO PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE THAT THERE WAS NO DONOR CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE </p><p>GOZ, BUT THAT A RETURN TO THE RULE OF LAW AND A </p><p>TRANSPARENT LAND REFORM PROCESS WERE PREREQUISITES FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06423  01 OF 02  171216Z </p><p>DANISH ASSISTANCE TO THE GOZ.  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD </p><p>PROPOSED THAT A POSSIBLE WAY TO MOVE FORWARD ON LAND </p><p>REFORM WOULD BE FOR THE DONOR COMMUNITY TO SEND AN </p><p>INFORMAL DELEGATION TO VISIT THE PROVINCE OF MIDLANDS </p><p>WHERE THE GOVERNOR AND COMMERCIAL FARMERS ARE OPEN TO </p><p>DIALOGUE AND LOCAL SOLUTIONS THAT MIGHT MORE CLOSELY </p><p>FOLLOW THE 1998 DONORS\' CONFERENCE GUIDELINES ARE BEING </p><p>CONSIDERED.  WHILE SOME RESERVATIONS WERE EXPRESSED, THE </p><p>DONORS AS A WHOLE AGREED THAT THIS WAS A WORTHY </p><p>INITIATIVE TO FOLLOW.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>UNDP HOSTS DONOR COMMUNITY MEETING </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE UN RESIDENT COORDINATOR VICTOR ANGELO HOSTED </p><p>A DONOR COMMUNITY MEETING ON NOVEMBER 9 FOR THE </p><p>AMBASSADORS OF 22 DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS, THE DIRECTOR OF </p><p>USAID, THE COUNSELOR OF THE UNITED KINGDOM\'S DEPARTMENT </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (DFID), THE EUROPEAN UNION </p><p>REPRESENTED BY THEIR LEAD TECHNICAL OFFICER, AND THE </p><p>WORLD BANK DEPUTY RESREP.  THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING </p><p>WAS FOR RESREP ANGELO TO RECEIVE DONORS\' REACTIONS TO </p><p>THE DRAFT UNDP MISSION REPORT ON THE LAND REFORM PROCESS </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE, AS WELL AS TO DISCUSS HOW THE UNDP AND </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY COULD MOVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOZ OVER </p><p>THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION.  THE </p><p>RESIDENT COORDINATOR ALSO INFORMED THE DONORS THAT HE </p><p>HAD MET WITH HIGH LEVEL OFFICIALS OF THE GOZ REGARDING </p><p>THE UNDP DRAFT REPORT AND HE HAD EMPHASIZED TO THEM THAT </p><p>FOR THE UNDP TO SUPPORT THE GOZ LAND REFORM PROGRAM, IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06423  01 OF 02  171216Z </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE LEGAL, CREDIBLE, AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTABLE.  WHEN ASKED BY THE ASSEMBLED DONORS WHAT </p><p>HE MEANT BY THESE WORDS, THE RESIDENT COORDINATOR </p><p>ANSWERED THAT "LEGAL" MEANT LEGAL, "CREDIBLE" MEANT THAT </p><p>IT HAS TO BE BASED ON A WIDE NATIONAL CONSENSUS, AND </p><p>"IMPLEMENTABLE" MEANT THAT WHAT IS OCCURRING NOW IS NOT </p><p>IMPLEMENTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>DONOR CRITICISM OF THE UNDP DRAFT REPORT </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A NUMBER OF ATTENDEES SPOKE STRONGLY ABOUT THE </p><p>HISTORICAL INACCURACY OF THE DRAFT REPORT REGARDING THE </p><p>ROLE OF THE DONOR COMMUNITY ON LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE, </p><p>AS WELL AS THE APPARENT BIAS IN THE REPORT AGAINST THE </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY AS A POSITIVE FORCE IN THE LAND REFORM </p><p>PROCESS IN ZIMBABWE.  THE COUNSELOR FOR DFID STRESSED </p><p>THAT THE REPORT MADE NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ALL THE </p><p>SUPPORT THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS PROVIDED TO LAND REFORM </p><p>AND RESETTLEMENT SINCE ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE.  THE </p><p>WORLD BANK DEPUTY RESREP SAID WHAT WAS VERY DISTURBING </p><p>ABOUT THE REPORT WAS THAT IT LACKED THE PERSPECTIVE OF </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS, AND THAT IT PORTRAYED THE GOZ AND THE </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY AS BEING IN OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8610 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06423  02 OF 02  171223Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------A04EF3  171223Z /22 </p><p>R 171029Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7637 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006423 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AND AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, A/AID RMCCALL, DAA/AFR VNEWTON </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06423  02 OF 02  171223Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/17/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP HOLDS FOLLOW-UP MEETING WITH THE DONOR </p><p>COMMUNITY ON THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>OVER LAND REFORM.  THE RESIDENT COORDINATOR ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THE CRITICISM THE UNDP HAD RECEIVED REGARDING THE </p><p>DRAFT REPORT WAS LARGELY VALID AND THAT CHANGES WOULD BE </p><p>MADE TO THE REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>DONOR PREREQUISITES FOR MOVING FORWARD ON LAND REFORM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) RESIDENT COORDINATOR ANGELO QUERIED THE ASSEMBLED </p><p>GATHERING IF ANYONE HAD CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS ON HOW TO </p><p>MOVE THE DISCUSSION ON LAND REFORM WITH THE GOZ IN A </p><p>POSITIVE DIRECTION.  A NUMBER OF AMBASSADORS AND HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONERS SPOKE ON THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE GOZ </p><p>RETURN TO THE RULE OF LAW AND A TRANSPARENT AND </p><p>EQUITABLE LAND REFORM PROCESS THAT ADHERES TO THE TENETS </p><p>OF THE 1998 DONORS\' CONFERENCE AGREEMENT.  THE GERMAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND THE AUSTRALIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER BOTH </p><p>SPOKE FORCEFULLY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE </p><p>PREREQUISITES, BEFORE THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS COULD </p><p>AGAIN PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE DANISH AMBASSADOR TOLD THE GROUP THAT AT THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 7 MEETING BETWEEN THE DANISH MINISTER FOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION, JAN TROJBORG, AND PRESIDENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06423  02 OF 02  171223Z </p><p>MUGABE, THE MINISTER HAD TRIED TO MAKE CLEAR TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT THAT THERE WAS NO DONOR CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE </p><p>GOZ AND LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE, AND THE DANISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS WILLING TO ASSIST ZIMBABWE ON LAND </p><p>REFORM.  HOWEVER, HE ALSO STRESSED THAT THE RETURN TO </p><p>THE RULE OF LAW ON OCCUPIED FARMS AND A TRANSPARENT LAND </p><p>REFORM PROCESS BASED ON THE 1998 DONORS\' CONFERENCE WERE </p><p>PREREQUISITES FOR DANISH ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD PROPOSES A WAY FORWARD </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD THEN PROPOSED THAT A WAY TO </p><p>BREAK THE CURRENT IMPASSE AND MOVE THE DISCUSSIONS ON </p><p>LAND REFORM FORWARD WOULD BE TO VISIT SITES IN MIDLANDS </p><p>PROVINCE WHERE THE AMBASSADOR IN AN EARLIER TRIP AND </p><p>USAID OFFICIALS IN JUST THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAD VISITED </p><p>WITH GOVERNOR CEPHAS MSIPA AND COMMERCIAL FARMERS WHO </p><p>HAD BEEN WORKING TOGETHER CONSTRUCTIVELY ON LAND REFORM </p><p>IDEAS.  THE GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF THE USAID OFFICIALS </p><p>WHO VISITED THIS PROVINCE IS THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE </p><p>SET OF ACTORS OF GOODWILL, INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR, WHO </p><p>MIGHT DEVELOP THEIR OWN COMMUNITY INITIATIVES.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT AN INFORMAL DELEGATION FROM </p><p>DONOR EMBASSIES AND THE UNDP VISIT THESE SITES IN </p><p>MIDLANDS AND SEE FIRSTHAND WHETHER THERE ARE </p><p>COMPLEMENTARY NON-GOVERNMENTAL APPROACHES TO LAND REFORM </p><p>IN THIS PROVINCE THAT THE DONOR COMMUNITY COULD CONSIDER </p><p>SUPPORTING.  THE AMBASSADOR MADE CLEAR THAT THIS WOULD </p><p>BE A LOOK SEE MISSION WITH NO COMMITMENTS BEING MADE AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06423  02 OF 02  171223Z </p><p>THAT THE UNDERTAKING WOULD BE UNDP LED.  WHILE THERE </p><p>WERE SOME RESERVATIONS RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>ASSEMBLED DONOR COMMUNITY CONCERNING THE GOZ\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW SUCH APPROACHES, A CONSENSUS WAS </p><p>REACHED TO SEND A SMALL DELEGATION TO MIDLANDS PROVINCE </p><p>AND REPORT BACK TO THE UNDP AND THE DONOR COMMUNITY AT A </p><p>FUTURE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: IT WAS CLEAR FROM THIS MEETING THAT </p><p>THERE REMAINS A GREAT DEAL OF SKEPTICISM AND CONCERN </p><p>WITHIN THE DONOR COMMUNITY REGARDING THE FINAL VERSION </p><p>OF THE UNDP MISSION REPORT ON THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  THERE ALSO REMAINS A STRONG CONSENSUS AMONG </p><p>THE DONORS, THAT UNTIL THE GOZ UPHOLDS THE RULE OF LAW </p><p>AND SHOWS READINESS TO RETURN TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE </p><p>1998 DONOR CONFERENCE, THERE IS LITTLE OR NO ROOM TO </p><p>MANEUVER ON THIS ISSUE.  JUDGING BY THE DONOR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES RESPONSES, WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD\'S PROPOSAL MAY OFFER A WAY FOR THE </p><p>UNDP TO TAKE THE LEAD ON FINDING A MECHANISM FOR </p><p>REENGAGING PRESIDENT MUGABE AND THE GOZ ON THE LAND </p><p>REFORM ISSUE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
