This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for </p><p>November 6, 2002.  Please note that Turkish press reports </p><p>often contain errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana </p><p>does not vouch for the accuracy of the reports summarized </p><p>here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  COORDINATING GOVERNOR TO REPLACE OHAL GOVERNOR </p><p>(Sabah)  Following the 15-year state of emergency (OHAL) in </p><p>the East and Southeast, which is to end on November 30 in </p><p>Diyarbakir and Sirnak, the only provinces where OHAL </p><p>remains in effect, the OHAL Governor\'s Office will be </p><p>replaced by the Coordinator Governor\'s Office.  During the </p><p>Turkish National Security Council (MGK) meeting last month, </p><p>Interior Ministry Muzaffer Ecemis briefed MGK members on </p><p>his Ministry\'s "classified" report, along with a series of </p><p>measures to be taken after OHAL ends in the region.  The </p><p>Coordinator Governor will reportedly have the same </p><p>privilege of using special allocations from the Prime </p><p>Ministry budget as the OHAL Governor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  NGO REPORT CALLS DIYARBAKIR RETURNEE KILLINGS "TERROR" </p><p>(Evrensel)  A report prepared by an Association for the </p><p>Oppressed (MAZLUM-DER) about the killing of three returnees </p><p>to Bismil\'s (Diyarbakir) Ugrak village by village guards </p><p>called the incident not a blood feud, but "terror" by </p><p>village guards which threatened the social peace.  The </p><p>delegation called for removal of obstacles in the way of </p><p>village returns and abolition of the village guard system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  THREE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES INVESTIGATED FOR PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN DEHAP RALLY </p><p>(Evrensel)  An investigation has been launched against </p><p>three Diyarbakir public employees for participating in the </p><p>Democratic People\'s Party (DEHAP) rally and the </p><p>inauguration of a DEHAP election office in Lice </p><p>(Diyarbakir).  The public employees have been suspended </p><p>until the investigation is concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  DEHAP PETITIONS TO CANCEL VOTES IN TWO TOWNSHIPS </p><p>(Evrensel)  Claiming voters were forced to cast their votes </p><p>openly in Sirnak\'s Beytussebap and Uludere townships, as </p><p>well as many villages, the Democratic People\'s Party </p><p>(DEHAP) petitioned the Provincial Election Board to cancel </p><p>the elections (in those townships and villages).  In </p><p>addition, Youth Party (GP) Sirnak candidate Tahir Adiyaman </p><p>claimed Ayvalik and Basaran villagers were forced to cast </p><p>their votes openly and complained the Election Board </p><p>refused to process objections to that end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  103 ELECTION VIOLATION APPLICATIONS </p><p>(Evrensel)  One hundred and three people applied to the </p><p>Crisis Desk formed by the Diyarbakir Chapter of the Human </p><p>Rights Association (HRA), reporting rights violations </p><p>during the November 3 elections. According to the Desk, </p><p>observers serving at 17 different ballot boxes were </p><p>prevented, while 37 people were arrested on election day </p><p>for arguing with security forces.  Alleged violations </p><p>included forcing voters to vote openly, pressuring them to </p><p>vote for another party (rather than the Democratic People\'s </p><p>Party - DEHAP), preventing them from casting their votes, </p><p>as well as threats and wrong electorate information cards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  MERSIN POLICE BRIEFED ON EU HARMONIZATION LAWS </p><p>(Milliyet/Hurriyet/Turkiye)  Chief Public Prosecutor Halil </p><p>Acioglu briefed 500 police chiefs and police officers at </p><p>the Mersin Security Directorate on EU Harmonization Laws. </p><p>Police were informed about recent amendments to the </p><p>Criminal Court Procedures Law (CMUK), the Police Duty and </p><p>Authorization Law, the Meetings, Demonstrations and Marches </p><p>Law, the State Security Court and Trial Procedures Laws, </p><p>the Associations Law, as well as Regulations on Arrest, </p><p>Detention and Testimony Taking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  NEW ADANA MP\'S LOBBY TO POSTPONE ADANA AIRPORT\'S CLOSURE </p><p>(Milliyet/Hurriyet)  Following a meeting with </p><p>representatives of the Adana and Mersin industrial </p><p>organizations, newly elected Justice and Development Party </p><p>(AKP) and Republican People\'s Party (CHP) parliamentarians </p><p>and provincial chairmen faxed a joint message to their </p><p>headquarters to postpone the closure of the Adana Airport </p><p>to flights until April 1, 2003.  In addition to </p><p>postponement of the Airport\'s closure, the message called </p><p>for putting in service a secondary runway, and use of the </p><p>Incirlik Air Base during the two-month renovation project. </p><p>(Note:  Several papers had already reported the closure of </p><p>the Adana Airport to flights as of November 4 due to repair </p><p>and maintenance.) </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
