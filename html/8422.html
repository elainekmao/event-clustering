<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001392 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/WCI - PROSPER/MILLER, EUR - JONES, L/EUR - </p><p>LAHNE, DRL, INR/WCAD - SPRIGG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 FIVE YEARS AFTER CLOSURE ICTY </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BK, HR, SR, NL, ICTY </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY: SENIOR OTP OFFICIALS DOWNBEAT ON "NEW ERA" </p><p>IN SAM/ICTY COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: BELGRADE 1158 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY:  Clifton M. Johnson, Legal Counselor. </p><p> Reason: 1.5(D) and 1.6. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C)   Summary.  According to Chief of Investigations </p><p>Patrick Lopez-Terres of the International Criminal Tribunal </p><p>for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), cooperation with Belgrade </p><p>authorities has not significantly improved since December. </p><p>Despite the positive press that accompanied Chief Prosecutor </p><p>Carla Del Ponte\'s recent visit to Belgrade, Lopez-Terres </p><p>maintains that Serb authorities were still responding to </p><p>requests for documents and requests for waivers for witnesses </p><p>only under strong pressure from the ICTY if at all.  Del </p><p>Ponte,s Political Adviser, Jean-Daniel Ruch, provided a </p><p>similar, downbeat, assessment, suggesting that the new era in </p><p>SAM/ICTY cooperation may be short-lived unless the OTP </p><p>quickly sees tangible results.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Lopez-Terres, who accompanied Del Ponte on her recent </p><p>visit, refused to </p><p>identify the exact number of outstanding requests except to </p><p>say that there were </p><p>"tens of requests" outstanding and that many were </p><p>substantive.  He also </p><p>indicated that the Prosecutor was still locked in a fight </p><p>with the Serbs regarding a so-called Rule 54 bis motion </p><p>(Note:  Rule 54 bis is used by the Prosecutor to request an </p><p>order compelling a State to produce documents or information. </p><p> End note).  Lopez-Terres cited the fact that the Prosecution </p><p>had to resort to Rule 54 bis coupled with the fact that there </p><p>had been no movement on this issue by the Serbs since </p><p>December as evidence of continued Serb intransigence. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Lopez-Terres also complained bitterly about the Serb </p><p>attitude towards </p><p>fugitive war criminals.  Exasperated, he stated that the </p><p>Serbs seemed to </p><p>believe that the arrest and transfer of Veselin Sljivancanin </p><p>-- wanted for the </p><p>Vukovar massacres -- would somehow obviate the need for the </p><p>Serbs to arrest and </p><p>transfer any of the other fugitive war criminals, many of who </p><p>the OTP believes are hiding in Serbia. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Lopez-Terres did admit that there had been some </p><p>progress, particularly </p><p>on the Serb commitment to set up its own war crimes court. </p><p>He indicated, </p><p>however, that this was clearly a long-term effort that was </p><p>only now in the </p><p>conceptual stage.  He, in turn, was more focused on the </p><p>requests, including </p><p>requests for access to state archives, that had yet to be </p><p>answered by Serb </p><p>authorities.  The failure to answer these requests, he </p><p>maintained, and, in particular, the failure to grant the </p><p>waivers necessary for some witnesses to testify were damaging </p><p>the Prosecutor\'s ability to complete investigations and </p><p>conduct trials. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  When asked by an embassy legal officer to square </p><p>positive local and </p><p>international press reporting of Del Ponte\'s recent visit </p><p>with his own very </p><p>negative assessment, Lopez-Terres at first dodged the issue </p><p>entirely, clearly </p><p>not wanting to be put in a position where he was </p><p>contradicting the Prosecutor. </p><p>When pressed, however, he resorted to a middle ground, </p><p>suggesting that the </p><p>press had made more of the statements than was warranted. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Political Adviser Ruch sounded a similarly downbeat </p><p>note.  He bluntly noted that despite the "nice atmosphere" </p><p>and assurances flowing from the meetings, there had been "no </p><p>change" in Serb cooperation toward the ICTY.  Tracking many </p><p>of points raised separately by Lopes-Terres, he first </p><p>highlighted the lack of progress in arresting and </p><p>transferring Mladic and Sljivancanin.  While conceding that </p><p>the transfer of Radic was a positive step, he was dismissive </p><p>of ongoing efforts to transfer Stanisic and Simatovic noting </p><p>that these transfers were in the SAM,s interest and required </p><p>little political will. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  With respect to document transfers and testimony </p><p>authorization, Ruch similarly noted that while the OTP and </p><p>SAM had reached an understanding on a process for giving the </p><p>OTP access to the documents it needed in exchange for an OTP </p><p>commitment to support appropriate protective measures aimed </p><p>at preventing the shared documents from being used against </p><p>SAM in the ICJ case, the process itself was "too cumbersome" </p><p>and was already showing signs of not working.  He explained </p><p>that under the agreed approach, OTP would identify specific </p><p>documents of interest, SAM would then locate and show them to </p><p>OTP investigators, OTP would then identify the specific </p><p>documents or excerpts that they wished to introduce as </p><p>evidence, SAM would then consider and request protective </p><p>measures, the OTP would then confirm that it could support </p><p>the requested protective measures, at which point an internal </p><p>SAM process would review and approve the documents for </p><p>release.  Ruch noted that as a first test of this process the </p><p>OTP had immediately delivered to SAM a request for access to </p><p>certain documents but that SAM had yet to respond and move </p><p>the process to the second step by providing access to OTP. </p><p>Given this situation, the OTP intended to press forward with </p><p>an order compelling production under Rule 54 bis. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Ruch summed up by stating that the OTP believed </p><p>there was "no change" in Serb cooperation with the ICTY and </p><p>that it was "the same" as before Del Ponte,s recent trip to </p><p>the United States.  Underscoring the point, he passed on a </p><p>copy of May 23 letter to the Secretary from five members of </p><p>Congress which stated that progress towards meeting </p><p>certification requirements "remains insufficient."  He </p><p>intimated that the OTP had been involved in the letter and </p><p>shared its assessment. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Comment:  Lopez-Terres and Ruch are Del Ponte,s </p><p>closest confidants on substantive matters in the OTP.  As </p><p>such, their uniform emphasis on the negative aspects of </p><p>Belgrade,s cooperation are a striking and surprising </p><p>contrast to the upbeat tone offered by Del Ponte in her </p><p>public statements following her Belgrade visit (See Reftel). </p><p>While Lopez-Terres was very careful not to directly </p><p>contradict Del Ponte\'s public statements, it was also clear, </p><p>from Lopez-Terres\' day-to-day, operational standpoint, that </p><p>little of substance had changed; that it was, in Lopez-Terres </p><p>own words, "business as usual" with Serb authorities.  One </p><p>explanation for the divergence is that Del Ponte is simply </p><p>out of touch with actual developments on the ground with </p><p>respect to SAM cooperation.  More likely, given the sources, </p><p>the comments of Lopez-Terres and Ruch track her own view and </p><p>indicate that her positive public statements were a </p><p>calculated effort at seeing whether a change in the </p><p>atmospherics of the SAM/ICTY relationship might deliver </p><p>better results than her previous more combative approach. </p><p>Given the comments of those closest to her on these issues, </p><p>it appears that this honeymoon will be short-lived unless the </p><p>SAM acts quickly to satisfy an impatient OTP.  End Comment. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
