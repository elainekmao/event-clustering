THE MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT PREVIOUSLY THERE </p><p>WERE LARGE FACTORIES BUILT IN THE BIGGER CITIES </p><p>AND OWNED BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY.  HE SAID THE </p><p>ONE IN ZENICA EMPLOYED 100,000 PEOPLE.  BECAUSE </p><p>THE SURROUNDING TOWNS AND VILLAGES WERE A SOURCE </p><p>OF CHEAP LABOR, MOST OF THE WORKERS WERE BROUGHT </p><p>IN FROM THE VILLAGES TO WORK.  THIS DEPLETED THE </p><p>SMALLER AREAS OF MANPOWER AND TOOK JOBS AWAY FROM </p><p>THE CITY DWELLERS.  THE NEW GOVERNMENT WANTS TO </p><p>CHANGE THAT.  THEY WANT THE LARGER FACTORIES TO </p><p>BE REPLACED BY SMALLER, MORE MODERN FACTORIES SO </p><p>THAT CITY PEOPLE CAN BE EMPLOYED.  THE VILLAGES </p><p>IN OUTLYING AREAS WOULD THEN USE THEIR MANPOWER </p><p>AND RESOURCES FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD </p><p>PRODUCTION.  PERHAPS SMALLER SATELLITE FACTORIES </p><p>WOULD ALSO BE BUILT IN THE RURAL AREAS FOR THE </p><p>MANUFACTURE OF CLOTHING, SPAR </p><p>E PARTS, ETC., HE </p><p>SAID. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SOME COMMUNITY LEADERS RESIST CHANGE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT THERE ARE LEADERS </p><p>IN SOME MUNICIPALITIES WHO ARE RESISTING THE </p><p>INITIATIVES OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT.

THESE LEADERS ARE IN PROZOR, KISELJAC, </p><p>AND BUSOVACA, (HVO CONTROLLED AREAS) AS WELL AS </p><p>IN OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.

THE MINISTER SAID THAT DURING THE TROUBLE OF </p><p>THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE SPIRIT OF THE </p><p>BOSNIAN PEOPLE HAS REMAINED UNDAUNTED.  HE WENT </p><p>ON TO SAY THAT MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE </p><p>WORLD, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD AND </p><p>APPRECIATED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT SPIRIT.  IT </p><p>WAS U.S. SUPPORT, HE SAID, THAT GAVE THE BOSNIAN </p><p>PEOPLE THE WILL TO CONTINUE TO RESIST AGGRESSION. </p><p>HE SAID THE PEOPLE HAVE COMPLETELY LOST FAITH </p><p>WITH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LIKE FRANCE, GREAT </p><p>BRITAIN, GERMANY, AND ITALY.  HE WENT ON TO SAY </p><p>THAT HE THOUGHT MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE </p><p>COUNTRIES SUPPORTED THEIR CAUSE, BUT THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS DID NOT.  HE NOTED THE "RISE OF </p><p>FASCISM AND RACIST INCIDENTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES" </p><p>AS STRONG INDICATIONS THEY WERE "NOT LIKELY TO BE </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO VICTIMS OF SERB AGGRESSION IN </p><p>BOSNIA."  HE SAID THAT EVEN WITHOUT THE MASSIVE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AID FROM THE USA, THE BOSNIAN PEOPLE </p><p>WOULD HAVE FOUND STRENGTH IN SIMPLY KNOWING THAT </p><p>AMERICANS WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR CAUSE.  BUT </p><p>THEY DEEPLY APPRECIATED THE HUMANITARIAN AID, HE </p><p>SAID, AND WOULD REMAIN ETERNALLY GRATEFUL. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01634  03 OF 04  251058Z </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>PEOPLE FEAR A RETURN TO HUNGER </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.

EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THEY NOW HAVE AMPLE FOOD TO EAT, THE </p><p>MINISTER SAID, THERE IS GREAT ANXIETY THAT THE </p><p>FOOD WILL RUN OUT AND HUNGER WILL RETURN.  THE </p><p>MINISTER SAID THAT 17 PER CENT OF THE LAND AROUND </p><p>ZENICA IS ARABLE AND THAT MORE HAS BEEN </p><p>CULTIVATED THIS YEAR THAN EVER BEFORE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>FOREIGN INTEREST IN BOSNIAN RESOURCES </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.
