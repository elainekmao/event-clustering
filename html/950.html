WINN, REASON </p><p>1.5(B,D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) PRIME MINISTER MELES TOLD CHARGE AUGUST 8 THAT </p><p>THE U.S. STATEMENT AGAINST EXPULSIONS OF ERITREANS, </p><p>COMBINED WITH REPORTS THAT THE U.S. TOLD ISAIAS THAT </p><p>ETHIOPIA IS TOO FRAGILE TO COMPROMISE, REFLECT ANTI- </p><p>ETHIOPIA BIAS WITHIN INFLUENTIAL USG CIRCLES. </p><p>ACCORDINGLY, WE SHOULD PERHAPS BACK OFF EFFORTS TO </p><p>PREVENT WAR, SINCE THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY DEMANDING </p><p>THAT ISAIAS WITHDRAW FROM BADME, AND THE U.S. DOESN\'T </p><p>HAVE THE WILL OR CAPACITY TO MAKE THAT DEMAND.  INSTEAD, </p><p>WE SHOULD ALLOW THINGS TO EVOLVE NATURALLY AND ASSESS </p><p>WHAT WE MIGHT DO TO PICK UP THE PIECES AFTER A WAR.  WE </p><p>THINK MELES\' STARK APPRAISAL WAS IN PART FOR EFFECT AMID </p><p>LINGERING CONCERNS ABOUT THE U.S. STATEMENT ON </p><p>DEPORTATION.  WHEN PRESSED, HE MADE IF CLEAR THAT HE </p><p>WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH ISAIAS IF THE LATTER </p><p>DEMONSTRATED "HE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON."  WHILE MELES </p><p>WAS NOT A PARAGON OF FLEXIBILITY, WE STILL NEED TO PRESS </p><p>AHEAD WITH PEACE INITIATIVES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CHARGE AND POLOFF CALLEO ON PRIME MINISTER MELES </p><p>AUGUST 8, AT EMBASSY REQUEST, PRIMARILY TO DISCUSS EVENTS </p><p>IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.  AFTER THAT </p><p>OISCUSSION (SEPTEL), THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO THE </p><p>ONGOING BORDER CONFLICT BETWEEN ETHIOPIA ANO ERITREA. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>WHERE TO GO FROM HERE? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CHARGE COMMENTEO THAT MELES AND ISAIAS, WHO USED </p><p>TO BE SOURCES OF HELPFUL EXPERTISE AND ANALYSIS IN </p><p>REGIONAL ISSUES, ARE DISTRACTED BY THEIR OWN CONFLICT, </p><p>AND THEIR LEADERSHIP IS SORELY MISSED.  CHARGE ASKED WHAT </p><p>MELES MIGHT ACCEPT AS A SIGN FROM ISAIAS TO ALLOW A </p><p>SETTLEMENT ON TECHNICAL MODALITIES TO BE FINALIZEO. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>ISAIAS IS A SADDAM WHO DOESN\'T UNDERSTAND GAME RULES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) RETURNING TO AN OFT-REPEATED THEME, MELES </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THE ROOT ISSUE IS THAT ISAIAS DOES NOT </p><p>EVEN UNDERSTANO THE "RULES OF THE GAME" AND IS NOT A </p><p>RATIONAL DECISION-MAKER.  LIKE SADDAM HUSSEIN AND THE </p><p>INVASION OF KUWAIT, ISAIAS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BACK DOWN </p><p>NOW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AT VARIANCE WITH HIS </p><p>UNOERSTANDING OF THE REALITIES.  MELES PLACES THE </p><p>ERITREAN INVASION IN THE CONTEST OF CONFLICTING ECONOMIC </p><p>VISIONS.  ERITREA WAS CLEAR FROM 1991 ON THAT IT WANTED </p><p>TO BE SINGAPORE AND WOULO NEEO THE SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>"HINTERLANDS".  ETHIOPIA, NO HINTERLAND, UNDERTOOK A </p><p>ROUTE TO ITS OWN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT STYMIED </p><p>ERITREA\'S, AND ECONOMIC DISAGREEMENTS SIMMERED FOR SOME </p><p>TIME.  MELES HYPOTHESIZES NOW THAT ISAIAS INVADED BADME, </p><p>THE TRIGGER FOR THE CURRENT CONFLICT, IN PART TO WARN </p><p>ETHIOPIA OF ERITREAN CAPABILITIES SHOULD THE GFDRE </p><p>CONTINUE TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE ERITREAN ECONOMIC </p><p>VISION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ISAIAS ASSUMED, MELES BELIEVES, THAT ETHIOPIA WAS </p><p>MORE MILITARILY UNPREPARED THAN ERITREA ANO THAT IT WOULD </p><p>AVOID OPEN WAR BECAUSE IT HAS BENEFITED SO MUCH FROM </p><p>PEACE.  THIS WAS A MISCALCULATION.  WHILE ETHIOPIA WAS </p><p>MORE UNPREPARED, IT HAD THE CORE OF ITS ARMEO FORCES IN </p><p>PLACE AND WAS ABLE TO CALL UP OEMOBILIZED FIGHTERS AND TO </p><p>TRAIN OTHERS.  MOREOVER, WITH THE INVASION OF BAOME AND </p><p>THE ATTEMPT TO CHANGE FACTS ON THE GROUNO BY FORCE, </p><p>ERITREA CROSSED AN ETHIOPIAN RED LINE.  ON OTHER ISSUES, </p><p>ETHIOPIA MIGHT HAVE AGREED TO TURN ITS CHEEK, BUT THIS </p><p>AFFRONT WAS SO GREAT THAT TO LET IT PASS IN SILENCE WOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY TO RELINQUISH NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. </p><p>THUS, THE DEMAND THAT ISAIAS WITHDRAW AND THAT BADME BE </p><p>RETURNEO TO THE STATUS QUO ANTE IS EVERYTHING.  IF HE </p><p>DOES, THEN PERHAPS HE WILL HAVE LEARNEO HIS LESSON.  IF </p><p>HE OOES NOT, THEN HE MUST BE TAUGHT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. UNFAIR AND SHOWS LACK OF CONSENSUS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MELES WAS DISMISSIVE OF SUGGESTIONS FROM </p><p>WASHINGTON THAT A RENEWED ENGAGEMENT BY THE U.S. WOULD </p><p>BEAR FRUIT.  FIRST, HE EXPRESSED AGAIN HIS ANNOYANCE OVER </p><p>THE USG STATEMENT OF AUGUST 6 WITH REGARD TO THE </p><p>EXPULSIONS OF ERITREANS.  THIS, HE REPEATED, WAS UNFAIR </p><p>AND UNBALANCED.  THE U.S. SAIO NOTHING ABOUT THE CHILDREN </p><p>KILLEO IN MEKELLE, NOTHING ABOUT 170,000 DISPLACED AND </p><p>VOICELESS PEASANTS IN TIGRAY AND NOTHING ABOUT THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF ZAL ANBESSA, BUT IT ATTACKS ETHIOPIA FOR </p><p>POLITELY ASKING SOME POSSIBLE SECURITY THREATS TO LEAVE </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  THIS IS MORE THAN A SENTIMENTAL ISSUE, HE </p><p>ARGUED; SUBSTANTIVELY, THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH A STATEMENT </p><p>SUPPORTS THE ETHIOPIAN BELIEF, LONG HELD BUT IN ABEYANCE </p><p>IN RECENT MONTHS, THAT THE U.S. APPLIES A DOUBLE STANOARD </p><p>IN ITS TREATMENT OF ERITREA AND ETHIOPIA.  THIS WAS </p><p>ALWAYS CLEAR IN ANNUAL HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTS.  HE WAS </p><p>FOREWARNED THAT A STATEMENT WAS IN THE WORKS, AND ASSUMES </p><p>THE EVENTUAL FINAL VERSION WAS "SANITIZED" FROM EARLIER </p><p>DRAFTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IT IS CLEAR THEN, MELES ACCUSED, THAT THERE ARE </p><p>PEOPLE OF INFLUENCE IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHO ARE </p><p>CAPABLE OF WORSE LANGUAGE ABOUT ETHIOPIA AND THAT THERE </p><p>IS NO CONSENSUS ON THE ISSUE.  HE HAD JUST READ A </p><p>MAGAZINE INTERVIEW WITH ISAIAS, IN WHICH THE ERITREAN </p><p>INDICATED THAT U.S. OFFICIALS HAD TOLD HIM HE MUST BE </p><p>MORE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE ETHIOPIA IS TOO FRAGILE TO PERMIT </p><p>MELES TO BEND.  WHILE HE KNOWS ISAIAS PLAYS FAST AND </p><p>LOOSE WITH THE TRUTH, MELES SAID, SOMETHING LIKE THIS </p><p>MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID.  AFTER ALL, HE HAS HEARD THAT AT </p><p>LEAST ONE OF THE FACILITATORS HAS SAID HE REGRETS HAVING </p><p>DRAFTED THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS.  BY TELLING THIS TO </p><p>ISAIAS, THE U.S. MERELY REINFORCES ISAIAS\' MISPERCEPTIONS </p><p>OF THE SITUATION.  IF THE U.S. BELIEVES ETHIOPIA WILL </p><p>CRACK UNDER PRESSURE, ITS PREMISES ARE DIAMETRICALLY </p><p>OPPOSED TO THOSE ON WHICH MELES IS OPERATING. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>SO WHY DON\'T YOU JUST LAY OFF, LET THINGS EVOLVE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WITH ALL THIS IN MIND, MELES FINDS THE CONTINUING </p><p>U.S. WISH TO CONCENTRATE ON PREVENTION OF ARMED CONFLICT </p><p>OFF THE MARK.  TO PREVENT WAR WILL TAKE A VERY STRONG </p><p>MESSAGE TO ISAIAS.  ASKED BY THE CHARGE TO ELABORATE, </p><p>MELES PROPOSED THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE:  "ISAIAS, THIS IS </p><p>YOUR MESS.  YOU MAY PAY SOME POLITICAL COSTS BY </p><p>WITHDRAWING FROM BADME, BUT IF YOU DO NOT, YOU ARE ON </p><p>YOUR OWN, WITHOUT OUR SUPPORT AND WITHOUT OUR PRESSURE ON </p><p>ETHIOPIA TO AVOID WAR."  THIS MESSAGE, MELES STATED </p><p>CATEGORICALLY, IS ONE THAT THE U.S., WHICH ISSUED THE </p><p>AUGUST 6 STATEMENT AND WHICH MIGHT HAVE CALLED ETHIOPIA </p><p>FRAGILE, CANNOT AND WILL NOT SEND.  THUS IT IS BETTER, </p><p>MELES SUGGESTED, IF THE U.S. LETS THINGS TAKE THEIR </p><p>COURSE AND EVOLVE NATURALLY.  JUST BE AWARE, HE ADDED, </p><p>THAT NOTHING WILL PREVENT ETHIOPIA\'S ATTEMPT TO DISLODGE </p><p>ISAIAS FROM BADME IF HE DOES NOT WITHDRAW VOLUNTARILY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>WHY NOT PREPARE FOR THE EVENTUAL AFTERMATH? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) A BETTER USE OF OUR ANALYTIC CAPACITY, MELES </p><p>PROPOSED, IS TO ASSESS THE END GAME AND WHAT THE U.S. </p><p>MIGHT DO TO PICK UP THE PIECES LATER, AFTER THE WORST </p><p>HAPPENS AND THE TWO COUNTRIES FIGHT IT OUT.  A FRIEND </p><p>WITH RESOURCES AND A PLAN FOR THE AFTERMATH WOULD BE MOST </p><p>WELCOME.  WHY NOT PREPARE FOR THE THREE EVENTUALITIES: </p><p>ETHIOPIA CRACKS, ERITREA CRACKS, THERE IS A DRAW. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>MELES CAN WORK WITH ISAIAS, IF HE BACKS DOWN </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) CHARGE DEMURRED AT MELES\' CATEGORIZATION OF OUR </p><p>DEPORTATIONS STATEMENT, OBSERVING IT WAS ISSUED TO </p><p>ADDRESS A SYMPTOM OF THE LARGER CONFLICT.  HE URGED MELES </p><p>TO DIVORCE THE EXPULSIONS AND OUR STATEMENT FROM </p><p>EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT.  MOREOVER, TO THE EXTENT </p><p>THE EMBASSY OBTAINS CREDIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT ERITREAN </p><p>ABUSES OF ETHIOPIANS, WE WILL RESPOND PUBLICLY WITH </p><p>DISAPPROVAL THERE, TOO.  (CHARGE ADDED THAT AN EMBASSY </p><p>TEAM IS VISITING REPUTED ETHIOPIAN DEPORTEES IN DESSE </p><p>THIS WEEK.)  AS TO ISAIAS\' REPORTED STATEMENT ABOUT U.S. </p><p>OFFICIALS CALLING ETHIOPIA TOO FRAGILE TO BEND, THE </p><p>CHARGE ASSURED THE PRIME MINISTER THIS IS NOT U.S. POLICY </p><p>AND THAT HE COULD NOT IMAGINE SUCH A THING BEING </p><p>PRESENTED TO ISAIAS.  FINALLY, HE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN </p><p>OVER MELES\' DRAWING A COMPARISON BETWEEN ISAIAS AND </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN, COMMENTING THAT THIS IMPLIED MELES WOULD </p><p>NOT BE ABLE TO WORK WITH ISAIAS IN ANY EVENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) MELES ANSWERED THAT HE SEES THE STATEMENT AS A </p><p>REFLECTION OF A NEGATIVE STATE OF MIND AND THAT, WHILE </p><p>ISAIAS MIGHT HAVE LIED, HE IS STILL CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT </p><p>HE SAID.  AS TO THE SADDAM ANALOGY, MELES ASSURED CHARGE </p><p>HE CAN WORK WITH ISAIAS IF THIS CONFLICT IS SETTLED </p><p>PEACEFULLY, ALTHOUGH HE CAN "NEVER LOVE HIM OR TRUST HIM </p><p>AGAIN."  ASKED AGAIN WHETHER, FOR EXAMPLE, A COMMITMENT </p><p>BY ISAIAS TO WITHDRAW FROM BADME FIRST MIGHT SUFFICE TO </p><p>RESTART PEACE NEGOTIATIONS, MELES STRESSED THAT WHAT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT IS THAT THE INVADER WITHDRAW BEFORE THE </p><p>INVADED.  ERITREA HAS TO DO THIS UNILATERALLY, NOT AS ITS </p><p>SIDE OF A JOINT WITHDRAWAL FOR DEMILITARIZATION.  THAT </p><p>WILL MAKE THE POINT TO ALL ERITREANS THAT THERE CAN BE NO </p><p>CHANGE BY FORCE, AND THEY WILL ACT AS A BRAKE ON ISAIAS </p><p>SHOULD HE WISH TO GO ADVENTURING AGAIN.  THAT WILL BE </p><p>ETHIOPIA\'S GUARANTEE OF SECURITY IN FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) MOST OF THE PRIVATE PRESS IS EXPRESSING OUTRAGE </p><p>OVER THE U.S. STATEMENT AND ONE ARTICLE CALLED IT THE </p><p>FOURTH U.S. BETRAYAL OF ETHIOPIA (OUR REFUSAL TO STAND </p><p>AGAINST ITALY\'S INVASION, OUR FAILURE TO ASSIST WHEN SIAD </p><p>BARRE INVADED, AND OUR ACQUIESCENCE IN TPLF\'S ALLOWING </p><p>ERITREA ITS INDEPENDENCE BEING THE FIRST THREE).  MELES\' </p><p>PORTRAYAL OF THE BETRAYED ETHIOPIAN APPEARED HEARTFELT. </p><p>HIS ANALYSIS OF U.S. INCAPACITY TO ACT AS HONEST BROKER </p><p>NOW, WHILE ILLOGICAL FROM AN OBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEW, </p><p>CLEARLY REFLECTS A LOSS OF CONFIDENCE, ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT </p><p>EXCLUDE THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT HE ALSO SEEKS TO </p><p>BOLSTER U.S. RESOLVE.  MELES\' SUGGESTION THE U.S. BEGIN </p><p>ASSESSING WHAT IT MIGHT DO IN THE AFTERMATH OF WAR </p><p>APPEARS TO BE HIS WAY OF SAYING "IF YOU CAN\'T TAKE THE </p><p>HEAT, GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN."  WE THINK WE SHOULD STAY </p><p>IN THE KITCHEN AND BE PREPARED TO TAKE MUCH MORE HEAT </p><p>FROM BOTH MELES AND ISAIAS AS WE TRY TO PUSH THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS FORWARD.  THERE WILL ALWAYS BE TIME TO PICK UP </p><p>THE PIECES IF WE DO NOT SUCCEED. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) ASMARA, DAR ES SALAAM, KAMPALA AND NAIROBI </p><p>MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>BRENNAN </p><p></p></div>
