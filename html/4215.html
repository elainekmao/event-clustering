<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E AND EB/CBA - MERMOUD </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/LOBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, BEXP, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S QIZ MANAGERS SEEKING CONFERENCE DURING </p><p>FTA JC </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 1892 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 5485 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Summary:  Building on U/S Larson\'s visit to Amman </p><p>last month, QIZ park managers and GOJ officials are proposing </p><p>an investment promotion event to coincide with the December </p><p>11-12 FTA Joint Commission meeting in Washington.  We believe </p><p>such an event could help encourage both new QIZ investment </p><p>and encourage the diversification of Jordan\'s economy away </p><p>from dependence on Iraq.  We are prepared to assist in </p><p>planning for any such event.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  In the past two weeks, we have been approached by </p><p>QIZ park managers Halim Salfiti (Al Tajammouat), Jack Khayyat </p><p>(Al Dulayl), and Amr Majali (Irbid/Kerak/Aqaba), as well as </p><p>by Jordan Investment Board Director Reem Badran and QIZ </p><p>"forefather" Omar Salah, about the possibility of setting up </p><p>a QIZ-related event to take advantage of the planned FTA </p><p>Joint Commission meeting in Washington in mid December.  They </p><p>picture an event similar in structure and goals to an event </p><p>they attempted unsuccessfully to launch in Jordan earlier </p><p>this year (reftel).  They propose a U.S. Government-hosted </p><p>conference with either CEO\'s or Sourcing/Buying VP\'s from </p><p>major U.S. retailers, along with senior representatives from </p><p>the U.S. Association of Importers of Textile and Apparel </p><p>Products (USAITA).  Such an event, they believe, will not </p><p>only encourage more sourcing from Jordan, but will also </p><p>provide the positive PR necessary to coax additional </p><p>third-country investment in the QIZ\'s. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  As discussed during U/S Larson\'s visit to Amman and </p><p>Omar Salah\'s meeting in Washington with DoS Business </p><p>Coordinator Mermoud, such an event would provide a forum to </p><p>address particular concerns U.S. companies have, either as </p><p>buyers or investors, regarding political risk factors in </p><p>Jordan - specifically, how the Intifada and the prospect of </p><p>war in Iraq are affecting QIZ production, and how the GOJ and </p><p>park managers plan to mitigate those impacts.  While a number </p><p>of U.S. retailers are represented in the QIZ\'s, a number of </p><p>influential companies (notably GAP, Inc. and Victoria\'s </p><p>Secret) have cited these political risks as a primary reason </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>for withholding orders and investment. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Minister of Industry and Trade Salah al Bashir, who </p><p>will lead the Jordanian delegation to the Joint Commission, </p><p>supports this initiative.  We continue to believe in the </p><p>concept to encourage and bolster the QIZ initiative, which </p><p>has been successful beyond expectations, but still can make </p><p>greater contributions to Jordan\'s economic growth (ref b). </p><p>Given the current uncertainties about the economic fallout of </p><p>possible military action in Iraq, such an event would be a </p><p>timely complement to the official JC meetings.  It would also </p><p>provide substantive press coverage for the FTA/JC and real </p><p>business opportunities in the QIZ\'s.  In particular, QIZ </p><p>managers will be able to pitch major retailers who have been </p><p>reluctant to begin operations in Jordan because of their </p><p>concerns about possible disruptions in supply resulting from </p><p>either coalition activity in Iraq or an exacerbation of the </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  We think a meeting at the State Department chaired </p><p>by U/S Larson and Minister Bashir would be a natural </p><p>follow-up to the Under Secretary\'s visit to Jordan and would </p><p>provide the pull necessary to bring major garment retailer </p><p>CEO\'s and/or senior VP\'s, along with senior representatives </p><p>from USAITA, to the table.  We would be happy to help put </p><p>such a conference together. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
