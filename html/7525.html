<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000716 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J.FRAZER </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DECL: 4/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EPET, MOPS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA -- SSS DIRECTOR PREDICTS ENFORCEMENT </p><p>ACTION IN WARRI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reason </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. During an April 11 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, the Director General of the State </p><p>Security Service, Kayode Are, (SSS) predicted a post- </p><p>election "enforcement action" against Ijaw militants </p><p>in the Warri area. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Are contended  there was more to the current </p><p>unrest than mere competition over local governments. </p><p>First both the Ijaw and Urhobos have demanded the </p><p>redrafting of local government boundaries to reduce </p><p>the number of Local Government Areas (LGAs) controlled </p><p>by the smaller Itsekiri ethnic group. In Delta State, </p><p>the Urhobos already controlled eight LGAs, the Ijaw </p><p>dominated nine and the Itsekiri three.  However, the </p><p>three controlled by the Itsekiri held the oil. </p><p>Consequently, the Ijaw and the Urhobo had been </p><p>canvassing for a new delineation where each would gain </p><p>one local government at Itsekiri expense, leaving the </p><p>smaller group with only one LGA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Are said these demands were unreasonable. The </p><p>real motive underlying this was the desire to evict </p><p>the Itsekiri off this resource-laden land. However, </p><p>the area is the core of the Itsekiri\'s ancient kingdom </p><p>established six centuries ago. The Ijaw and Urhobo </p><p>were adjacent only because the Itsekiri granted them </p><p>privilege to occupy Itsekiri land many years ago.  Now </p><p>that the other two are larger and stronger they want </p><p>to oust the Itsekiri from their ethnic patrimony. </p><p>Thus, when the clamor to redraw the LGA boundaries </p><p>fell on deaf ears, Ijaw militants took matters into </p><p>their own hands. They began to raze villages and </p><p>forcibly evict the Itsekiri. This exposed the real </p><p>objective of the militant Ijaws, Are revealed.  The </p><p>Ijaws and Urhobos would not be satisfied with more </p><p>local governments, they wanted control of the land </p><p>which, in their worldview, meant direct control of the </p><p>resources under it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ijaw thirst for the land had been whetted </p><p>by their long-time participation in oil bunkering, Are </p><p>added. That the Ijaws eventually threatened the oil </p><p>installations was no accident. It was part and parcel </p><p>of militant Ijaw chauvinism some ethnic leaders had </p><p>been brewing.  Unfortunately, the scores of unemployed </p><p>youth proved to be fertile ground for this </p><p>fermentation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Are stated that the Danjuma Commission </p><p>established to look into the unrest was a placeholder, </p><p>a mechanism to give the appearance that the GON was </p><p>"talking to the parties." Are contended the GON could </p><p>never meet the Ijaw\'s stated demands to reconfigure </p><p>the LGA\'s. First, the scheme was unjust; second, the </p><p>Itsekiri rightfully opposed it. Are declared the </p><p>Commission\'s only real purpose was to persuade </p><p>moderate Ijaw leaders to dissociate themselves from </p><p>their more militant kin. By killing soldiers and </p><p>innocent civilians, destroying villages and then </p><p>jeopardizing the national economy by shutting the oil </p><p>flow, the militants had gone too far in directly </p><p>challenging the government.  It would be impossible </p><p>for the GON to negotiate with them without </p><p>surrendering control of the area, and this would not </p><p>be done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) The Director General stated that the GON would </p><p>not act prior to the election.  After the election, he </p><p>predicted an "enforcement action" was certain. During </p><p>the interim,  army intelligence officers were to </p><p>collect information on the identity and whereabouts of </p><p>the Ijaw militants. With this information, Are hoped </p><p>the Army could be more discriminate in its operations </p><p>by seeking out key individuals and not attempting to </p><p>raid whole villages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: Are is a keen interlocutor who </p><p>usually is on the mark.  We believe this expose is no </p><p>exception.  We have previously stated that the Warri </p><p>crisis presented the GON with little choice. By any </p><p>estimation, the Ijaw militants have challenged the </p><p>GON. Calling the situation a "localized rebellion," </p><p>not too different from the "Warlordism" seen in </p><p>Liberia and Sierra Leone would not be wholly off the </p><p>mark. It would be difficult to imagine a negotiated </p><p>settlement that could mollify the GON, the Ijaw and </p><p>Itsekiri. Nigeria\'s vital national interests clearly </p><p>are at stake.  In this instance, a surgical, limited </p><p>police action is an easily defensible option. However, </p><p>the danger is that the Nigerian army has thus far </p><p>proven itself woefully incapable of that degree of </p><p>operational precision. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
