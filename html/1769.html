JOSEPH </p><p>MERANTE. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THE VATICAN\'S OVERRIDING CONCERN IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03297  01 OF 02  201534Z </p><p>MAINLAND CHINA IS ITS RIGHT TO MINISTER TO THE </p><p>ESTIMATED 10 MILLION CATHOLIC POPULATION.  THE </p><p>VATICAN AND THE PRC DO NOT HAVE OFFICIAL </p><p>RELATIONS.  THE PRC REPUDIATES VATICAN CLAIMS TO </p><p>LEAD CHINESE CATHOLICS AND INTERPRETS VATICAN </p><p>ECCLESIASTIC ACTIONS AS FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN </p><p>SOVEREIGN AFFAIRS.  THE PRC OVERSEES THE OFFICIAL </p><p>"CATHOLIC PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION," SET UP IN 1951 </p><p>TO HARMONIZE RELIGIOUS PRACTICE WITH STATE </p><p>AUTHORITIES.  AN UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC COMMUNITY </p><p>REMAINS LOYAL TO VATICAN LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>TAIWAN, THE VATICAN, AND THE PRC </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) THE VATICAN MAINTAINS OFFICIAL STATE-TO- </p><p>STATE RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN (THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>CHINA), HAVING TRANSFERRED ITS EMBASSY (KNOWN AS </p><p>A "NUNCIATURE") FROM BEIJING TO TAIPEI IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF THE REVOLUTION.  TAIWAN IN TURN MAINTAINS </p><p>AN EMBASSY TO THE VATICAN, PROVIDING THE ISLAND </p><p>NATION WITH A PRECIOUS EUROPEAN PLATFORM FROM </p><p>WHICH TO PURSUE A VIGOROUS DIPLOMATIC AGENDA. </p><p>THE VATICAN CONTINUES TO SIGNAL ITS READINESS TO </p><p>DOWNGRADE ITS TAIPEI MISSION AND ESTABLISH </p><p>OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH THE PRC.  THE VATICAN </p><p>AFFIRMS THAT THE MOTHBALLING OF ITS ORIGINAL </p><p>BEIJING NUNCIATURE WAS NEVER DEFINITIVE, ADDING </p><p>THAT IT HAS CONSISTENTLY PRACTICED A ONE-CHINA- </p><p>POLICY.  THE VATICAN HAS A LOW-KEY PRESENCE IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03297  01 OF 02  201534Z </p><p>HONG KONG, AN OFFICE THAT IS A VESTIGE OF THE </p><p>HAND-OVER; IT CLAIMS TO BE POISED TO REOPEN IN </p><p>BEIJING QUOTE OVERNIGHT ENDQUOTE, A CLAIM THAT IS </p><p>LARGELY RHETORICAL.  TAIWAN\'S REPRESENTATIVES TO </p><p>THE VATICAN ARE SANGUINE AT THIS PROSPECT OF A </p><p>DIPLOMATIC SEA CHANGE, YET THE TAIWAN EMBASSY IS </p><p>QUIETLY EXPLORING OTHER WAYS TO PRESERVE A </p><p>DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN ROME, FOR INSTANCE, </p><p>THROUGH ACCREDITATION TO THE SOVEREIGN MILITARY </p><p>ORDER OF MALTA, LOCATED IN ROME AND FORMALLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED BY 85 GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) VATICAN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRC REMAIN </p><p>UNOFFICIAL, IRREGULAR, AND OFTEN VITUPERATIVE. </p><p>THE STICKING POINT IS PRC UNWILLINGNESS TO </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE VATICAN JURISDICTION OVER THE CHINESE </p><p>CATHOLIC COMMUNITY, INCLUDING VATICAN OVERSIGHT </p><p>OF THE TRAINING OF CLERGY AND THE APPOINTMENT OF </p><p>NEW BISHOPS.  THE PRC TREATS VATICAN CLAIMS TO </p><p>ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY IN CHINA AS TANTAMOUNT </p><p>TO FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL SOVEREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS.  WHILE THE PRC PERMITS OCCASIONAL CHURCH </p><p>VISITS BY VATICAN ENVOYS, INCLUDING AT THE </p><p>CARDINAL LEVEL, AND ALLOWS LIMITED TRAINING </p><p>ABROAD FOR "PATRIOTIC" SEMINARIANS, THE RUMORS OF </p><p>AN EMERGING DIPLOMATIC RAPPROCHEMENT HAVE BEEN </p><p>GREATLY OVERSTATED, WITH THE VATICAN-PRC </p><p>RELATIONSHIP INCREASINGLY STRAINED.  IN JANUARY </p><p>2000 THE PRC CROSSED A RUBICON OF SORTS WHEN THE </p><p>STATE-SPONSORED "CATHOLIC PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION" </p><p>ORDAINED FIVE BISHOPS IN DEFIANCE OF A VATICAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03297  01 OF 02  201534Z </p><p>BAN.  CONVERSELY, THE MASS BEATIFICATION OF 120 </p><p>CHINESE MARTYRS AT THE VATICAN ON OCTOBER 1, </p><p>2000, A PRC NATIONAL HOLIDAY IN CELEBRATION OF </p><p>THE REVOLUTION, WAS A PROVOCATION, WITH THE PRC </p><p>LAMBASTING THE MARTYRS AS CRIMINAL ELEMENTS AND </p><p>IMPERIALIST BLACKGUARDS.  THE PRC WAS DEAF TO </p><p>VATICAN PROTESTS THAT THE CHOICE OF DATE WAS </p><p>SHEER COINCIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>THE CATHOLIC PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION AND THE </p><p>UNDERGROUND CHURCH: A BLURRING LINE. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) IN 1951 THE PRC ESTABLISHED AN OFFICIAL </p><p>"CATHOLIC PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION" TO MINISTER TO </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S CATHOLI </p><p>C POPULATION.  RELIGIOUS </p><p>PRACTICE OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF THE PATRIOTIC </p><p>ASSOCIATION IS TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL, YET HAS </p><p>CONTINUED IN GATHERINGS OF THE SO-CALLED </p><p>UNDERGROUND CHURCH.

MOREOVER, A NUMBER OF ELDERLY </p><p>CLERGY REMAIN IN DETENTION, WITH THE VATICAN </p><p>OSTENSIBLY UNABLE TO DETERMINE THEIR WELFARE AND </p><p>WHEREABOUTS.  THE VATICAN IS CAUTIOUS IN ITS </p><p>COMMENTARY ON THE PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION AND THERE </p><p>ARE INDICATIONS THAT THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE </p><p>PATRIOTIC AND UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IS </p><p>BLURRING.  ACCORDING TO VATICAN SOURCES AND FIELD </p><p>REPORTING, A NUMBER OF CLERGY IN THE PATRIOTIC </p><p>CHURCH ARE IN TRUTH LOYAL TO THE VATICAN. </p><p>SIMILARLY, THE VATICAN WELCOMES VISITS BY </p><p>PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION SEMINARIANS AS A CHANCE TO </p><p>SHAPE, EVEN IF INDIRECTLY, THEIR THEOLOGICAL </p><p>FORMATION. </p><p>MERANTE </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
