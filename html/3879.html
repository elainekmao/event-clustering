<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001840 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, PM/B, L, T, IO; NSC FOR E. </p><p>MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10-03-2002 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  ICC Article 98 agreement:  Sri Lanka update </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1814, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an Action Request -- Please see Para 4. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Foreign Secretary Rodrigo sent Mission a letter </p><p>today containing a proposed alteration to the U.S. draft </p><p>ICC Article 98 agreement.  (Note:  The text of the </p><p>letter is contained in para 5 below; it is also being </p><p>faxed to SA/INS.)  The MFA proposes replacing the </p><p>current para 5 of the U.S. draft with a new text.  This </p><p>text states, in part, that "(E)ach party will enter into </p><p>immediate consultations in the event of any difficulties </p><p>arising with regard to the interpretation or application </p><p>of this agreement..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Mission\'s sense was that the GSL proposal </p><p>effectively undermined the purpose of our original </p><p>para 5 (which essentially commits the two parties to </p><p>non-cooperation with the ICC).  The Ambassador called </p><p>Rodrigo and underscored that point.  Rodrigo replied </p><p>that he agreed that the MFA\'s draft was "a bit open- </p><p>ended" and could use tightening.  The MFA would welcome </p><p>a counter-draft by the U.S.  Asked for an explanation of </p><p>the MFA\'s concerns, Rodrigo related that there were </p><p>apprehensions that the U.S. draft of para 5 could be </p><p>problematic for "a small guy," i.e., Sri Lanka.  As </p><p>written, the draft text could conceivably put the GSL in </p><p>the position of violating a UNSC resolution, for </p><p>example.  Other countries, such as EU members, could </p><p>then place pressure on the GSL, charging it with non- </p><p>compliance with its international obligations.  The </p><p>Ambassador replied that he would send the MFA\'s proposal </p><p>back to Washington for review, but he did not think the </p><p>proposed alteration by the MFA was acceptable in that it </p><p>seemed to envisage a fundamental change of direction </p><p>from the original text.  Rodrigo noted that MFA Legal </p><p>Adviser Rohan Perera was in New York until October 12 </p><p>and could be reached at the Sri Lankan Mission there for </p><p>discussions on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Action Request:  Mission will continue to press </p><p>the case for unaltered agreement to our original </p><p>proposal with Minister Milinda Moragoda and other high- </p><p>level GSL interlocutors.  In the meantime, we would </p><p>appreciate Washington\'s analysis of the MFA\'s proposal. </p><p>We wonder, for example, whether it is possible for the </p><p>U.S. to come up with any language that would meet MFA </p><p>concerns that the draft as written potentially could put </p><p>Sri Lanka at odds with the UN.  Sri Lanka is a moderate- </p><p>sized country, easily buffeted by international </p><p>pressures, and its concerns are comprehensible in that </p><p>light.  That said, we do not know whether any alternate </p><p>U.S. construction is feasible on this matter.  We would </p><p>also appreciate seeing the Para 5 equivalent signed with </p><p>Romania and other countries if the U.S. has agreed to </p><p>language different than the original U.S. draft. </p><p>(Note:  We do not recommend contacting Rohan Perera in </p><p>New York; we think his work on this matter is probably </p><p>over-complicating efforts to wrap up an agreement.)  End </p><p>Action Request. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The text of the Foreign Secretary\'s letter </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Further to the discussion we have had on the above </p><p>matter. </p><p> </p><p>As you know, the matter was also taken up in New York </p><p>last month with Ms. Christina Rocca, US Assistant </p><p>Secretary of State, and in subsequent consultations in </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Washington between Minister Milinda Moragoda and Deputy </p><p>Secretary of State Richard Armitage. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry has since considered the matter further and </p><p>we would propose certain amendments to the text of the </p><p>draft Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>In paragraphs 1, 2, and 4 of the draft, we believe US </p><p>interests, in ensuring non-surrender of its nationals to </p><p>the ICC, are fully met.  Reciprocally, paragraph 3 </p><p>requires consent of the Government of Sri Lanka in the </p><p>event of a Sri Lankan national being called upon to be </p><p>surrendered to the Court. </p><p> </p><p>However, with regard to paragraph 5, it is felt that the </p><p>language could create difficulties for Sri Lanka </p><p>considering the wide powers conferred on the Court under </p><p>the ICC Statute even in respect of non-State parties to </p><p>the Statute.  It is therefore suggested that paragraph 5 </p><p>in the US draft be replaced by the following which would </p><p>bring in consultative/review procedures: </p><p> </p><p>"Each party will enter into immediate consultations in </p><p>the event of any difficulties arising with regard to the </p><p>interpretation or application of this Agreement and </p><p>where necessary Parties may review the provisions of the </p><p>Agreement.  If an understanding is reached on any matter </p><p>relating to this Agreement, after such review, such </p><p>understanding shall be confirmed through an exchange of </p><p>diplomatic notes." </p><p> </p><p>We would be happy to discuss the matter further with you </p><p>here in Colombo, or arrangements could be made, since </p><p>Legal Adviser Rohan Perera is currently in the US, for </p><p>discussions to take place either in New York or </p><p>Washington early next week. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
