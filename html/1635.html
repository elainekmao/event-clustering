THE SPOKESMAN DID NOT DIVULGE </p><p>THE CONTENTS OF THE PRIVATE LETTER. VATICAN SOURCES SAY IT </p><p>STRESSED THE ECUMENICAL NATURE OF THE PONTIFF\'S VISIT TO </p><p>UKRAINE THIS SUMMER. CARDINAL ROBERTO TUCCI, THE OUTGOING </p><p>DIRECTOR OF PAPAL TRAVEL, DELIVERED THE LETTER TO THE </p><p>ORTHODOX PATRIARCH.

VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN </p><p>NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THE RADIO REDUCED SIGNAL STRENGTH BY 50 </p><p>PERCENT IN FEBRUARY 2001, AND THAT CUTS IN BROADCASTING </p><p>SCHEDULES WOULD BE MADE TO BRING LEVELS INTO LINE WITH </p><p>ITALIAN STANDARDS. BROADCASTS VIA FM AND SHORT WAVE (HOW </p><p>MOST OF THE WORLD RECEIVES THE RADIO\'S PROGRAMMING) WILL NOT </p><p>BE AFFECTED BY THE CHANGES. VATICAN RADIO POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>ITS TRANSMISSIONS CONFORM TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON </p><p>ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY 14 </p><p>OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES.

HE WILL CARRY </p><p>A LIGHT WOODEN CROSS FOR THE FINAL FEW METERS OF THE </p><p>PROCESSION AND THEN DELIVER HIS CUSTOMARY MESSAGE AT THE </p><p>CONCLUSION OF THE SERVICE.

THE MONEY WAS USED FOR </p><p>EMERGENCY AID IN PLACES LIKE KOSOVO, MOZAMBIQUE AND ETHIOPIA </p><p>AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN GEORGIA, CAMEROON AND PERU AMONG </p><p>OTHERS. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE FIGURE ARE TWO "CONTINENT </p><p>SPECIFIC" PROJECTS. THE "POPULORUM PROGRESSIO" FOUNDATION </p><p>FUNDS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES FOR THE POOR IN LATIN AMERICA. </p><p>SOME US DOLLARS 2 MILLION WENT TO MOSTLY AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PROJECTS.

"COR UNUM\'S" </p><p>PRESIDENT, GERMAN BORN ARCHBISHOP PAUL CORDES, DOWNPLAYED </p><p>THE MONETARY FIGURE OF THE PAPAL DONATIONS SAYING THAT THE </p><p>FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE POPE\'S GESTURES OF SOLIDARITY WITH </p><p>THE POOR AND NEEDY. THE POPE RECEIVES HIS CHARITY FUNDING </p><p>FROM AN ANNUAL WORLDWIDE COLLECTION IN CATHOLIC PARISHES AND </p><p>FROM DONATIONS FROM DIOCESES, RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS AND </p><p>PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>VATICAN PEEVED BY EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CENSURE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   THE VATICAN HAS EXPRESSED "DISAPPOINTMENT" OVER A </p><p>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION CONDEMNING IT FOR ALLEGED </p><p>INACTION IN THE FACE OF REPORTS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF NUNS BY </p><p>PRIESTS. (REFTEL). THE VATICAN\'S OBSERVER AT THE PARLIAMENT, </p><p>MONSIGNOR PAUL GALLAGHER, SAID THE VATICAN SHARED THE </p><p>EUROPEAN BODY\'S CONCERN ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, AND IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02022  02 OF 03  121846Z </p><p>PARTICULAR CATHOLIC NUNS. HE OPINED THE RESOLUTION REFLECTED </p><p>ANTI-VATICAN SENTIMENTS IN SOME QUARTERS OVER ABORTION AND </p><p>CONTRACEPTION POLICY CONFLICTS. GALLAGHER NOTED THAT LESS </p><p>THAN 20 PERCENT OF THE PARLIAMENT\'S MEMBERS TOOK PART IN THE </p><p>VOTE BUT THAT "ANY ACT OF A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION IS TO BE </p><p>TAKEN SERIOUSLY." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>VATICAN CABINET LEVEL APPOINTMENTS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.   THE VATICAN HAS ANNOUNCED TWO SENIOR CABINET LEVEL </p><p>APPOINTMENTS. CARDINAL CRESCENZIO SEPE IS TO TAKE THE REINS </p><p>OF THE VATICAN\'S POWERFUL MISSIONARY OFFICE, THE </p><p>CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLES, AND </p><p>ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO MARIA VEGLIO BECOMES SECRETARY (NUMBER 2 </p><p>POSITION) OF THE CONGREGATION FOR THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES. </p><p>CARDINAL SEPE WAS THE BRAINS AND THE ENERGY BEHIND THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S SUCCESSFUL MILLENNIUM YEAR CELEBRATIONS. HE IS A </p><p>CHARISMATIC FIGURE AND MEDIA-SAVVY. HIS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL AND FUND-RAISING ABILITY SHOULD RESULT IN THE </p><p>POWER CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLES </p><p>ASSUMING AN EVEN HIGHER PROFILE IN THE VATICAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p>(NOTE: IT IS NO SECRET THAT SEPE IS A PAPAL FAVORITE AND HAS </p><p>BEEN REWARDED FOR HIS Y2K ACCOMPLISHMENTS. WHEN PAPAL </p><p>ADVISORS HEARD THAT SEPE WAS TO BE CREATED A CARDINAL </p><p>FEBRUARY LAST, THEY COMMENTED THAT HE WAS TOO YOUNG - HE </p><p>TURNS 58 THIS YEAR. POPE JOHN PAUL II REPLIED, "I BECAME </p><p>POPE AT THE SAME AGE!" END NOTE). ARCHBISHOP VEGLIO IS </p><p>PRESENTLY THE VATICAN\'S AMBASSADOR TO LEBANON AND KUWAIT, </p><p>AND THE POPE\'S REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02022  02 OF 03  121846Z </p><p>THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. HE SUCCEEDS AN AGING AND RECLUSIVE </p><p>UKRAINIAN ARCHBISHOP AS NUMBER TWO AT THE CONGREGATION FOR </p><p>THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES (NOTE: THE CONGREGATION HANDLES ALL </p><p>ISSUES RELATING TO THOSE CHRISTIANS WHO ARE NOW IN COMMUNION </p><p>WITH ROME BUT USE EASTERN OR ORTHODOX-LIKE WORSHIP FORMS AND </p><p>CHURCH ORGANIZATION. END NOTE). VEGLIO\'S LANGUAGE SKILLS AND </p><p>DIPLOMATIC EXPERIENCE (HE HAS ALSO SERVED IN EUROPE, AFRICA, </p><p>SOUTH AMERICA AND THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION) AUGUR WELL FOR A </p><p>REVAMPING OF THE POSITION. (COMMENT: THE CONGREGATION FOR </p><p>THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES IS SET TO TAKE ON GREATER IMPORTANCE </p><p>IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF THE POPE JOHN PAUL\'S OUTREACH </p><p>TO ORTHODOXY FOR WHOM THE EXISTENCE OF EASTERN RITE </p><p>CATHOLICS IS A MAJOR STICKING POINT COMPLICATING EVENTUAL </p><p>UNION WITH ROME. END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>VATICAN YEAR BOOK </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.
