<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAKAR 002990 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/06/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, SG </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT WADE SEIZES OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM LIBYA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  DAKAR 2916 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER CHRIS ROCHESTER. </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) ON AUGUST 28, SENEGALESE AUTHORITIES REFUSED </p><p>PERMISSION TO APPROXIMATELY 100 YOUNG WOMEN TO BOARD </p><p>A LIBYAN CHARTERED AIRCRAFT, WHICH APPARENTLY LANDED </p><p>WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORIZATION, AND WHICH WAS ALLEGEDLY </p><p>TAKING THE WOMEN TO LIBYA TO PARTICIPATE IN A </p><p>CULTURAL EVENT CELEBRATING THE THIRTY-SECOND </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBYAN REVOLUTION.  WHAT BEGAN AS </p><p>A SUSPECTED TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS MATTER QUICKLY </p><p>INTENSIFIED TO A SIGNIFICANT DIPLOMATIC INCIDENT </p><p>BETWEEN LIBYA AND SENEGAL. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) SENEGALESE AUTHORITIES STRONGLY SUSPECTED THAT </p><p>THE CULTURAL PRETEXT WAS IN FACT A BLATANT OPERATION </p><p>IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING.  ON AUGUST 31, THE DAKAR </p><p>PROSECUTOR FORMALLY CHARGED AND DETAINED THREE WOMEN, </p><p>WHO WERE SUSPECTED OF COORDINATING THE SCHEME.  THE </p><p>LIBYAN GOVERNMENT DENIED ANY INVOLVMENT IN </p><p>TRAFFICKING AND CLAIMED THAT IT HAD SENT THE AIRCRAFT </p><p>TO DAKAR SOLELY TO BRING A SENEGALESE DANCE TROUPE </p><p>(NUMBERING APPROXIMATELY THIRTY-FIVE MEMBERS) TO </p><p>LIBYA. THE TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS ALLEGATIONS ARE </p><p>SERIOUS, BUT THE MORE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THE </p><p>MATTER HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>SENEGAL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE GOS REACTED PUBLICLY AND VIGOROUSLY.  FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER GADIO DEPLORED THE INCIDENT IN A ROUND OF </p><p>MEDIA APPEARANCES AS "AN UNFRIENDLY ACT."  THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOS WAS </p><p>TAKING A NUMBER OF STEPS IN RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT: </p><p>THE GOS WAS RECALLING AMBASSADOR MAMADOU DIOUF FROM </p><p>TRIPOLI FOR CONSULTATIONS; A DIPLOMATIC NOTE HAD BEEN </p><p>CONVEYED TO LIBYAN AUTHORITIES; LIBYA WAS REQUIRED TO </p><p>REDUCE ITS DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN SENEGAL; THE NUMBER </p><p>OF TRANSIT VISAS FOR LIBYAN NATIONALS WOULD BE </p><p>RESTRICTED.  FINALLY, PRESIDENT WADE SPOKE OUT ABOUT </p><p>THE MATTER PUBLICLY, SAYING THAT THE INCIDENT WAS "AN </p><p>UNFRIENDLY GESTURE TOWARD SENEGAL."  HE ADDED THAT HE </p><p>WAS HURT ("BLESSE") THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED AND THAT </p><p>HIS FIRST DUTY WAS "TO PROTECT THE SENEGALESE </p><p>PEOPLE."  HE NOTED, WITHOUT ELABORATION, THAT THE </p><p>INCIDENT "WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT" AND THAT THERE HAD </p><p>BEEN "PRECEDENTS" FOR THIS KIND OF THING WITH LIBYA. </p><p>ASKED IF HE WERE CONSIDERING FURTHER DIPLOMATIC </p><p>SANCTIONS, PRESIDENT WADE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD MAKE </p><p>FURTHER DECISIONS AFTER CONSULTING WITH HIS RECALLED </p><p>AMBASSADOR. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE DETAILS OF THE ALLEGED HUMAN TRAFFICKING </p><p>INCIDENT AND THE EVENTUAL JOURNEY - LONG OR </p><p>ABBREVIATED - OF THE CASE THROUGH THE COURTS ARE OF </p><p>INTEREST, BUT MORE SIGNIFICANT IS THE PROBABILITY </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT WADE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE INCIDENT TO </p><p>SEND A VIGOROUS PUBLIC MESSAGE TO THE SENEGALESE </p><p>PEOPLE, THE REGION AND THE WEST THAT HE INTENDED TO </p><p>KEEP HIS DISTANCE FROM LIBYA.  WHEN ADDED TO OTHER </p><p>RECENT, LESS PUBLIC, REMARKS TO US BY PRESIDENT WADE </p><p>(REFTEL), THE IMPRESSION IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS </p><p>DECIDED TO ABRUPTLY DECELERATE WHAT HAD BEEN AN </p><p>ACTIVE POLICY OF HIGH-LEVEL CONTACTS WITH LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) PRESIDENT WADE VISITED TRIPOLI SEVERAL TIMES SOON </p><p>AFTER HIS ELECTION (NOT TO MENTION CONTACTS WHILE HE </p><p>WAS IN THE OPPOSITION).  KHADAFI MADE A NUMBER OF </p><p>PROMISES TO WADE, BOTH FINANCIAL AND PAN-AFRICAN </p><p>(PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THE AFRICAN UNION), THAT </p><p>CONFORMED TO HIS USUAL PATTERN OF INGRATIATION. </p><p>PRESIDENT WADE APPEARED TO BE PERSUADED AT THE TIME </p><p>THAT THE LIBYAN PROMISES (INCLUDING TO SUPPLY OIL AT </p><p>DISCOUNT PRICES, TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN THE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF AN OIL REFINERY, TO MAKE OTHER LARGE </p><p>BUT UNSPECIFIED INVESTMENTS IN SENEGAL AND WEST </p><p>AFRICA AND TO SUPPORT REGIONAL AND PAN-AFRICAN </p><p>POLITICAL PROJECTS), WERE SERIOUS.  THERE IS NOW A </p><p>REAL DEGREE OF TENSION, EVEN BITTERNESS, BETWEEN </p><p>SENEGAL AND LIBYA, GENERATED BY AN APPARENTLY SHARP </p><p>REVERSAL OF SENEGALESE CONFIDENCE IN TRIPOLI. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER DJIBO KA MAY HAVE BEEN ON </p><p>TARGET WHEN HE SAID IN A RECENT INTERVIEW THAT THIS </p><p>CHILL IN BILATERAL RELATIONS WAS INEVITABLE, GIVEN </p><p>THE EXCESSIVE ENTHUSIASM, EVEN "AMATEURISM," OF </p><p>SENEGALESE RELATIONS WITH LIBYA SINCE THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  KA ARGUED THAT IF SENEGAL </p><p>WISHED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY "THE COUNTRIES AND </p><p>INSTITUTIONS THAT COUNT IN THE WORLD," IT HAD TO STAY </p><p>THE COURSE DIPLOMATICALLY AS A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY </p><p>GIVING PRIORITY TO OTHER DEMOCRATIC NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ELAM-THOMAS </p><p></p></div>
