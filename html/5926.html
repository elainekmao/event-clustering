<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LAGOS 000384 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ENERGY UPDATE, FEB 20 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This periodic update covering energy issues includes: </p><p>--Oil Strike Suspended, No Effect on Exports </p><p>--Wellhead Blows in Ogoniland </p><p>--Local Content Rule Gives U.S. Firms Opportunity and Risk </p><p>--Gas Developments, and </p><p>--Almost Never Ever Power Anywhere </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>OIL STRIKE SUSPENDED, NO EFFECT ON EXPORTS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The strike by Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) </p><p>employees has been suspended before reaching a full week. </p><p>Oil producers reprted no effect on production.  DPR efforts </p><p>at placing managers in the field to conduct the inspection </p><p>and gatekeeper functions of DPR appear to have kept all </p><p>lifting and exporting processes on track.  Meetings between </p><p>the various oil industry unions and government and </p><p>legislative officials apparently resolved the strike, at </p><p>least temporarily, which DPR called in response to </p><p>outstanding salary payments and its assertion that DPR must </p><p>be granted autonomy from GON influence.  Reports indicate </p><p>that the GON agreed to immediately pay salary and allowance </p><p>arrears and to continue talks to develop a mechanism to give </p><p>DPR more autonomy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>WELLHEAD BLOWS IN SOUTH SOUTH </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On Monday, February 17, a Shell Oil Company wellhead </p><p>ruptured in the Ogoni region of Rivers State east of Port </p><p>Harcourt.  Shell no longer extractsoil from Ogoniland, but </p><p>maintains old wells and  pipeline in the area.  A news </p><p>story the following Friday reported a major blowout with </p><p>significant spillage and potential environmental damage, but </p><p>a Shell representative had informed Post earlier in the week </p><p>that the situation was under control and spillage minimal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Shell reported that a young man tampered with the </p><p>device known as a Christmas tree attached to the wellhead </p><p>and broke open a valve.  This caused a tremendous release of </p><p>gas pressure and noise, frightening the man who ran from the </p><p>site, but also alerting nearby townspeople who apprehended </p><p>him and turned him over to police.  Shell reported that </p><p>because of the high gas content of crude in that region, the </p><p>resulting spill was not as serious as past incidents, </p><p>including a 2001 blowout in the same Yorla field, which </p><p>raised tension between Shell and the Ogoni people.  Shell </p><p>reported that a joint investigative team from the company </p><p>and state and federal governments was on-site by Thursday </p><p>and considered the spill manageable.  Other sources, </p><p>including the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People </p><p>(MOSOP), confirmed that the incident appeared contained and </p><p>that local residents had cooperated in Shell\'s efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) COMMENT: In previous oilfield incidents in Ogoniland </p><p>and elsewhere, local residents sometimes had tried to </p><p>extract cash payments from oil companies in exchange for </p><p>access to a damaged facility or spill site.  This practice </p><p>raised tensions in the Niger Delta region as oil companies </p><p>and workers were often unwilling to respond immediately to a </p><p>reported crisis, which, the companies claimed, were often </p><p>acts of sabotage to undermine production and extract a </p><p>ransom.  This time, Shell and local residents cooperated, a </p><p>positive sign in the often-troubled region. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>LOCAL CONTENT RULE GIVES U.S. FIRMS OPPORTUNITY AND RISK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Chevron Nigeria Ltd. recently brought representatives </p><p>from ten companies, most of which are U.S.-based, to Nigeria </p><p>to explore business opportunities in its supply chain. </p><p>Representatives from companies including G.E., Solar </p><p>Turbines, and Universal Compression were shown fabrication </p><p>facilities in Lagos, Warri, and Onne in order to provide </p><p>them a realistic understanding of what it would take to </p><p>establish operations in Nigeria. Chevron hosted its </p><p>preferred suppliers in Nigeria to instruct them on the needs </p><p>of the company in meeting its local content obligations, and </p><p>on the challenges they would face in establishing operations </p><p>here.  For the most part each company would have to set up a </p><p>joint venture or locally-owned business to supply Chevron, </p><p>and would face the infrastructure and security challenges </p><p>Nigeria poses.  Regardless of the companies\' interest or </p><p>capacity to establish operations in Nigeria, Chevron is </p><p>committed to meeting its local content target. Chevron has a </p><p>joint venture agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum </p><p>Corporation (NNPC) that obligates it to comply with a GON </p><p>target of having 40 percent local content in its projects by </p><p>2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) A manager in Chevron\'s supply chain division told </p><p>Econoff that while the visiting companies did not signal an </p><p>immediate interest in establishing Nigerian operations, they </p><p>did seem to take away what Chevron intended to demonstrate; </p><p>that is, while the oil producer is obligated to use local </p><p>content, it would prefer to continue using its known </p><p>suppliers, but the challenges of establishing business </p><p>operations in Nigeria are significant.  The companies </p><p>invited to Nigeria were those suppliers with which Chevron </p><p>does the largest volume of business worldwide, and from </p><p>which Chevron can demand a price advantage.  The manager </p><p>indicated this strategy will be used later in the year in </p><p>Angola since the company faces local content requirements </p><p>from developing countries around the globe and is dealing </p><p>with them in a similar fashion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) COMMENT: GON local content requirements raise issues </p><p>with respect to Nigeria\'s compliance with the WTO Agreement </p><p>on Trade-Related Investment Measures, but the immediate goal </p><p>of providing opportunities to domestic companies likely is a </p><p>higher priority for the GON than is paying close attention </p><p>to its international trade obligations.  The willingness of </p><p>companies like ChevronTexaco to not only acquiesce in local </p><p>content rules but also expend resources to convince their </p><p>international suppliers to work within those parameters may </p><p>make it harder for the USG to press for compliance with WTO </p><p>and other trade agreements that these major oil companies </p><p>believe provide no scaleable economic advantage.  If the oil </p><p>majors can help establish workable Nigerian-based business </p><p>entities, it is possible that small American firms or firms </p><p>not having established business ties to the major oil </p><p>producers in Nigeria may not be able to compete fairly for </p><p>future contracts under GON rules or practices.  Should that </p><p>come about, the direct economic power of the big oil </p><p>companies may overshadow USG advocacy efforts and undermine </p><p>trade negotiations.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>GAS DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) The economic promise of Nigeria\'s natural gas </p><p>reserves continues to grow as several projects move into new </p><p>phases.  ChevronTexaco recently announced the discovery of </p><p>new gas reserves in the OPL 218 field it controls jointly </p><p>with Norwegian oil producer Statoil offshore of Rivers. </p><p>ChevronTexaco and Shell Oil, owner of the nearby OPL 219 </p><p>block, previously signed an MOU for a feasibility study for </p><p>a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) platform to develop </p><p>these fields, and the discovery of deepwater gas in OPL 218 </p><p>increases the viability of an FLNG project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Several West African countries have signed an </p><p>agreement to bring the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) </p><p>closer to reality.  Representatives from Nigeria, Benin, </p><p>Togo and Ghana signed a treaty at the West African Summit in </p><p>Dakar, Senegal, to establish a legal and fiscal framework </p><p>for the project.  To that end, the West African Gas </p><p>Administration will be established to oversee the WAGP from </p><p>its headquarters in Accra, Ghana.  Jay Pryor, Managing </p><p>Director of ChevronTexaco Nigeria, was quoted in press </p><p>accounts as lauding the agreement as an important step for </p><p>establishing conditions necessary for future direct foreign </p><p>investment in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>ALMOST NEVER EVER POWER ANYWHERE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) </p><p>continues to be plagued by power distribution problems. </p><p>Recent reports indicate that slow progress on repairs to gas </p><p>supply lines to NEPA generators is hampering power supply, </p><p>causing increasingly frequent power outages, particularly in </p><p>the Lagos zone.  One NEPA manager was quoted in the Vanguard </p><p>Newspaper as disclosing that while  daily demand for power </p><p>in the Lagos metropolitan area is 1200 megawatts (MW), NEPA </p><p>has been averaging 800MW of production during  the last </p><p>month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) COMMENT: Power outages and severe fluctuations in </p><p>current and voltage are becoming ever more frequent </p><p>throughout Nigeria.  As the weather continues to grow </p><p>warmer, the rumble of backup generators will become nearly </p><p>constant in wealthy neighborhoods, while darkness will </p><p>settle over poorer areas.  Until Nigeria can provide a </p><p>stable, affordable source of power, it will not attract the </p><p>kind of industrial investment it requires to diversify its </p><p>economy.  Even corporate giants like ChevronTexaco might not </p><p>lure their suppliers to Nigeria if fabricating firms cannot </p><p>keep their machines running. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
