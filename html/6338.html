<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000527 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Save generations from scourge of </p><p>      war" the pro-government daily "The Daily Mirror" </p><p>      dedicated its March 13 editorial to discouraging the </p><p>      United States from attacking Iraq, saying, "the </p><p>      unilateral use of force against Iraq is illegitimate </p><p>      under international law."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .But who really is for war against anything </p><p>      at this moment in time?  Very few, if reports around </p><p>      the world are anything to go by.  The majority of the </p><p>      people have said `NO\' to war in order `to save </p><p>      succeeding generations from the scourge of war. . .\' </p><p>      American presidents, going back to Franklin Roosevelt, </p><p>      have dismissed anti-war protests, much like George W. </p><p>      Bush did in declaring he wouldn\'t be swayed by millions </p><p>      of people around the world who gathered last month to </p><p>      protest a looming American-led invasion of Iraq. . . </p><p>      It is our well-considered view that leaping into a war, </p><p>      an unjustifiable war, is tantamount to telling the </p><p>      whole world to go to hell!." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
