<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001663 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USCINPAC FOR FPA </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BM, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSK HOLDS PRESS CONFERENCE; CONDEMNS HARASSMENT </p><p>IN RAKHINE STATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 1633 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: P/E Chief Paul Daley.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: At a press conference December 31, Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi continued to express "cautious optimism" about the </p><p>possibility of political change in Burma in 2003, but </p><p>complained about harassment during her recent trip to Rakhine </p><p>State.  Post recommends that the Department support her </p><p>comments with a statement that calls for change in Burma and </p><p>for GOB action to protect the rights of political parties </p><p>(see para 7 for suggested text of statement).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In a year-ending press conference held at the NLD\'s </p><p>Shwegondine headquarters in Rangoon, Aung San Suu Kyi </p><p>complained about USDA harassment during her recent trip to </p><p>Rakhine State, but continued to express cautious optimism </p><p>about the possibility for political change in Burma in 2003. </p><p>Overall, she said, there had been some good developments in </p><p>Burma in 2002, but not as much as the country demands.  Some </p><p>political prisoners had been released, but the NLD\'s position </p><p>remained that all should be released immediately, without </p><p>pre-conditions.  Similarly, the NLD had been able to open </p><p>some (about 90) of its 300 township offices, but had not been </p><p>allowed to open all that it was ready to open.  At the </p><p>insistence of the authorities, some openings had been </p><p>delayed.  By and large, she said, her travels in Burma had </p><p>also gone well, with the cooperation of the authorities. </p><p>However, her recent trip to Rakhine State, in particular, had </p><p>been marred by disturbances instigated by the USDA and other </p><p>semi-official organs of the government. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ASSK also said that she had been encouraged by the </p><p>spirit of the Burmese people, but "saddened" by the state of </p><p>the nation.  She had found, she said, a great sense of </p><p>"national solidarity" and a general awareness of the need for </p><p>change.  However, there was also a great concern about the </p><p>state of the economy and about the plight of farmers, who </p><p>were now obliged to sell a portion of their crop to the </p><p>government at below market prices.  The Burmese people, she </p><p>said, deserved a better standard of living and a better </p><p>governance.  Hopefully, they would get both in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In response to questions, she provided some details </p><p>about the harassment she had endured during the trip to </p><p>Rakhine State.  One government minister (reportedly the </p><p>Minister of Tourism Thein Zaw) had gone ahead to Mrauk Oo and </p><p>other cities and had urged the people not to turn out for the </p><p>NLD leaders.  The USDA, the Myanmar Red Cross, and the War </p><p>Veterans had then cooperated to block off streets in many </p><p>towns.  Other members of the USDA had distributed leaflets </p><p>questioning ASSK\'s patriotism and loyalty because of her </p><p>marriage to a foreigner.  Together, these actions showed, </p><p>ASSK said, how some elements in the government felt about her </p><p>travels.  NLD Spokesman U Lwin had been told in Rangoon that </p><p>none of the harassment had been ordered by the SPDC and, she </p><p>said, she was prepared to accept that; however, the </p><p>harassment had plainly been coordinated at some level </p><p>(perhaps the state level), since the same events occurred </p><p>again and again throughout the trip. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In regard to her talks with the government, ASSK </p><p>insisted that there was no dialogue.  There also was no </p><p>confidence-building -- that was over.  Relations with the </p><p>government, she said, were now in a "state of limbo."  She </p><p>was prepared to join in a dialogue with the government at any </p><p>time, with no preconditions.  However, it had to be a real </p><p>dialogue, not a "show-piece." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) This was ASSK\'s second press conference since she was </p><p>released in May.  Her intent was plainly to call attention to </p><p>the events in Rakhine State and to suggest that the </p><p>government may not be sincere in its dealings with her. </p><p>While she was careful not to accuse the SPDC itself for any </p><p>wrongdoing during her trip to Rakhine State, she made it very </p><p>clear that she held them responsible for the state of the </p><p>nation and the delays in the start of "real dialogue."  She </p><p>was also plainly walking a fine line in all her comments -- </p><p>never willing to actually breach whatever understandings she </p><p>has with the government regarding political behavior, but, at </p><p>the same time, making sure that everyone understood who the </p><p>bad guys are in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Action Recommended </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Given ASSK\'s comments, post suggests that the </p><p>Department make a statement of support for ASSK and the </p><p>dialogue process.  The British Embassy has told us that they </p><p>plan to recommend that their government (and the EU) also put </p><p>out messages.  We leave it to the Department to work out the </p><p>exact text (perhaps in coordination with the British), but </p><p>something along the following lines might be appropriate. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>"In a press conference in Rangoon on December 31, Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi described the harassment to which she was subjected </p><p>during her recent trip to Burma\'s Rakhine State.  While it is </p><p>not clear who is responsible for the actions of semi-official </p><p>government organizations like the Union Solidarity </p><p>Development Agency, the War Veteran\'s Organization, and the </p><p>Myanmar Red Cross, it is clear that efforts by </p><p>government-affiliated groups to harass opposition party </p><p>leaders cannot help a national reconciliation process to </p><p>which the Burmese government itself has committed itself. </p><p>The United States calls on the Government of Burma to ensure </p><p>that all political parties can carry their message to the </p><p>Burmese people in safety.  We also call on the State Peace </p><p>and Development Council to join with the NLD and </p><p>representatives of Burma\'s ethnic communities in a real </p><p>dialogue regarding constitutional issues.  Change is needed </p><p>in Burma.  As Aung San Suu Kyi said December 31, the Burmese </p><p>people deserve a better government and a better standard of </p><p>living.  Every effort should be made to see that they get </p><p>both in 2003." </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
