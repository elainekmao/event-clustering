<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001970 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC TO OFFER AMNESTY TO KEY MILITARY FIGURES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR TOM MCDONALD FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) A SMALL DEPUTATION OF MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE (MDC) MEMBERS LED BY HARARE BUSINESSMAN CLIVE </p><p>PUZEY CALLED ON AMBASSADOR MCDONALD APRIL 10 TO INFORM </p><p>HIM OF A PLAN TO OFFER AN AMNESTY DEAL TO APPROXIMATELY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01970  121839Z </p><p>TEN OF ZIMBABWE\'S TOP MILITARY LEADERS.  THE MDC HAD </p><p>IDENTIFIED FORMER ZIMBABWE ARMY CHIEF SOLOMON MUJURU AS </p><p>THE INDIVIDUAL WITH WHOM TO NEGOTIATE, AS THEY SAW HIM </p><p>AS BEST PLACED TO SELL THE DEAL.  PUZEY SAID THAT MUJURU </p><p>WAS CURRENTLY HOSPITALIZED IN SOUTH AFRICA, WHERE HE IS </p><p>BEING TREATED FOR COMPLICATIONS ARISING FROM HIV/AIDS. </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN BUSINESSMAN SAID THAT SOUTH AFRICAN VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT JACOB ZUMA OWED HIM A FAVOR AND HE WOULD CALL </p><p>IT IN, ASKING THE FORMER UMKHONTO WE SIZWE OFFICER TO </p><p>APPROACH MUJURU AS A MILITARY MAN AND LAY OUT THE DEAL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE MDC REASONS THAT ALL THE VIOLENCE AND </p><p>UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION </p><p>CAMPAIGN IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT CERTAIN TOP MILITARY </p><p>LEADERS FEEL INSECURE ABOUT THEIR FATES SHOULD THE MDC </p><p>WIN A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES.  THESE INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE </p><p>CHIEF OF THE DEFENSE FORCES VITALIS ZVINAVASHE, AIR </p><p>FORCE CHIEF PERENCE SHIRI, ARMY CHIEF CONSTANTINE </p><p>CHIWENGA, GENERAL MASHINGAIDZE AND AIR MARSHAL JOSIAH </p><p>TUNGAMIRAYI.  PUZEY DESCRIBED  POLICE COMMISSIONER </p><p>AUGUSTINE CHIHURI AS "HOPELESS," AND SAW NO NEED TO </p><p>OFFER HIM AMNESTY.  ALTHOUGH THE MDC DID NOT BELIEVE IN </p><p>GRANTING PRE-EMPTIVE AMNESTIES, IT THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO </p><p>EXTEND THIS OLIVE BRANCH TO THE "PEOPLE WITH THE GUNS" </p><p>IN ORDER TO MITIGATE, IF NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATE, THE </p><p>CURRENT WAVE OF POLITICALLY-INSPIRED VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) PUZEY TOLD AMBASSADOR MCDONALD THAT THE MDC </p><p>EXPECTED TO WIN 90 SEATS IN PARLIAMENT AND NEEDED </p><p>IMPARTIAL MONITORS TO BEGIN TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT INTIMIDATION WAS VERY POWERFUL AND THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01970  121839Z </p><p>THE ELECTION ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD BE RIGGED.  WHILE 99 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE MDC\'S MEMBERSHIP ACCEPTED THE PRINCIPLE </p><p>OF LAW AND ORDER, THE PARTY LEADERSHIP WAS HAVING </p><p>DIFFICULTY KEEPING THE LID ON THE FORMER\'S ANGER.  THE </p><p>MDC ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE PERSONAL SECURITY OF ITS </p><p>LEADER, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, AND MONITORED NERVOUSLY THE </p><p>MOVEMENTS OF ANTHONY WHITE, A FORMER SELOUS SCOUT TURNED </p><p>HIT MAN TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER, CURRENTLY RESIDING IN </p><p>BEIRA, MOZAMBIQUE.  THE PARTY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS BEST </p><p>FOR TSVANGIRAI TO LEAVE ZIMBABWE FOR A TIME, AND WOULD </p><p>BE SENDING HIM TO ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES ON A </p><p>PUBLIC RELATIONS AND FUND RAISING TRIP.  PUZEY TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT TSVANGIRAI WOULD TAKE THE MESSAGE TO ALL </p><p>WITH WHOM HE MET THAT THE MDC WAS COMMITTED TO TAKING </p><p>THE MORAL HIGH ROAD AND PLAYING THE GAME AS CLEANLY AS </p><p>POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: WHILE AN EXCITABLE CHARACTER, PUZEY HAS </p><p>REPORTED RELIABLY ON MDC PLANS AND THINKING.  WE THINK </p><p>THAT THE AMNESTY OFFER IS ON THE MONEY, AND IS A </p><p>SUGGESTION THAT WE OURSELVES MIGHT HAVE MADE TO THE MDC. </p><p>WE HOPE THE OFFER IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE INTERMEDIARY, AND </p><p>THAT HE IN TURN IS A SUCCESSFUL SALESMAN.  PUZEY\'S </p><p>PREDICTION OF A MDC SUPER MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT STRIKES </p><p>US AS EXCESSIVELY SANGUINE, BUT THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED </p><p>TIMES AND WE HESITATE TO RULE OUT SUCH A POSSIBILITY. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01970  121839Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
