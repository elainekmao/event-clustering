<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001250 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAID, EFIN, PREL, AF, CA, Afghanistan </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA\'S RESPONSE TO LETTER FROM UNDER SECRETARIES </p><p>LARSON AND TAYLOR ON FILLING THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>FINANCING GAP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. OTTAWA 1168 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 105217 </p><p> </p><p> 1. Hau Sing Tse, Vice-President of Canada\'s International </p><p>Development Agency has responded on behalf of the GOC to the </p><p>letter conveyed in Ref b.  Following is the faxed text of the </p><p>letter. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Begin text </p><p> </p><p>2003-05-02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mr. John B. Taylor </p><p>Under Secretary of Treasury </p><p>for International Affairs </p><p>U.S. Department of the Treasury </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Allan Larson </p><p>Under Secretary of State for Economic, </p><p>Business and Agricultural Affairs </p><p>U.S. Department of State </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear Sirs: </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your letter of 25 April regarding the </p><p>international community\'s support for Afghanistan\'s </p><p>reconstruction.  We too were encouraged by the show of </p><p>support through the participation of so many bilateral donors </p><p>and International organizations representated at the </p><p>Afghanistan High-Level Strategic Forum in Brussels. </p><p> </p><p>In reference to Finance Minister Ghani\'s request for </p><p>predictability of funding, Canada responded by pledging </p><p>financial support for the operating and development budgets </p><p>beyond this solar year.  As you know, Canada pledged CDN $250 </p><p>million in new aid to Afghanistan for the next two years.  We </p><p>have also heeded the Afghanistan Transitional Authoritiy\'s </p><p>request that funding be directed to their priorities.  This </p><p>is a fundamental principle of CIDA\'s Interim Assistance Plan </p><p>for Afghanistan as approved by the Minister for International </p><p>Cooperation, the Honourable Susan Whelan. </p><p> </p><p>In this respect, our program will support three areas from </p><p>the National Development Framework (NDF) and Budget:  rural </p><p>livelihoods and social protection; natural resources </p><p>management, with an emphasis on agreculture; and security and </p><p>the rule of law, and we will continue to make significant </p><p>contributions to the operating budget.  We informed Afghan </p><p>representatives in Brussels that CDN $23.5 million would be </p><p>provided for the operating budget for the current year </p><p>through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). </p><p>That contribution has already been forwarded to the ARTF. </p><p> </p><p>CIDA is continuing its dialogue with the Afghan Aid </p><p>Coordination Authority and with line ministries to determine </p><p>specific areas for program and project support within the </p><p>three NDF programs.  We will consider an additional </p><p>contribution to this year\'s operating budget as part of the </p><p>deliberations with our Minister, and these deliberations will </p><p>also take into account the unallocated portion of our pledge. </p><p> </p><p>In closing I would like to highlight the excellent </p><p>communication between our CIDA officials and your </p><p>representatives in the United States Embassy here in Ottawa. </p><p>I look forward to the continuation of our close cooperation </p><p>in assisting in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>Yours Sincerely, </p><p> </p><p>Hau Sing Tse </p><p>Vice-President Asia Branch </p><p> </p><p>cc:  Jonathan Fried, Senior Deputy Minister, Department of </p><p>Finance </p><p>     David Mulroney, Assistant Deputy Minister, Asia-Pacific, </p><p>DFAIT </p><p> </p><p>End text </p><p> </p><p>3.  As noted in Ref A, CIDA staff expect Minister Whelan to </p><p>make final decisions ("deliberations with our Minister") on </p><p>allocation of aid to Afghanistan in June. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
