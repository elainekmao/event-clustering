<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 002964 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/06/06 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT: THE EVOLVING ROLE OF LOCAL LEGISLATURES </p><p> </p><p>REF: HANOI 2885 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT C. PORTER, JR., CHARGE </p><p>D\'AFFAIRES, A.I., REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY.  THE GVN IS EMBARKED UPON A COURSE TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02964  01 OF 03  140146Z </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE POWERS OF LOCAL LEGISLATURES BUT IS </p><p>HAMPERED BY ITS OWN TRADITION OF "DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CENTRALISM" AND BY RESOURCE AND PERSONNEL CONSTRAINTS </p><p>AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL.  LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE PROUD OF </p><p>THE GREATER ROLES THEIR LEGISLATIVE BODIES HAVE GAINED </p><p>OVER THE PAST DECADE BUT ADMIT THAT LITTLE GENUINE </p><p>DEVOLUTION OF POWER IS IMMINENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>HANOI\'S VIEW ON DEVOLUTION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE 1992 SRV CONSTITUTION EXPLICITLY </p><p>DESIGNATES PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS -- WHICH EXIST ON THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL, DISTRICT, AND TOWNSHIP LEVELS -- AS THE </p><p>"LOCAL ORGAN OF STATE POWER" REPRESENTING THE "WILL, </p><p>ASPIRATIONS, AND MASTERY OF THE PEOPLE."  WHILE THEY </p><p>ARE MORE ACCURATELY REPRESENTATIVE BODIES RATHER THAN </p><p>LEGISLATIVE ENTITIES, THEY FIT INTO VIETNAM\'S </p><p>LEGISLATIVE SYSTEM UNDER THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  THEIR </p><p>LOCAL COUNTERPARTS ARE THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES, WHICH </p><p>REPRESENT THE ADMINISTRATIVE POWER OF THE STATE ON </p><p>THESE SAME LEVELS.  A 1994 "LAW ON ORGANIZATION OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL AND THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE" AND A 1996 </p><p>"ORDINANCE ON THE CONCRETE TASKS AND POWERS OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL AND PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE AT EACH LEVEL" </p><p>FURTHER SPELLED OUT THEIR RESPECTIVE DUTIES VIS-A-VIS </p><p>LOCAL DECISION-MAKING AND SUPERVISION.  A USD 1.3 </p><p>MILLION UNDP PROJECT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY SINCE 1999 ON </p><p>"STRENGTHENING REPRESENTATIVE BODIES, WITH FOCUS ON </p><p>PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL." ITS TARGET HAS BEEN </p><p>PRIMARILY HOW THIS GOAL MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THREE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02964  01 OF 03  140146Z </p><p>PILOT AREAS -- HAIPHONG CITY, NGHE AN PROVINCE AND BINH </p><p>DUONG PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  IN ADVANCE OF AN OCTOBER 25-NOVEMBER 2 TRIP </p><p>ALONG NATIONAL HIGHWAY ONE TO DISCUSS THIS AND OTHER </p><p>ISSUES (SEPTELS) WITH PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS, POL/C MET </p><p>ON OCTOBER 23 WITH DR. NGUYEN SI DUNG, DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S CENTER FOR INFORMATION, LIBRARY AND </p><p>RESEARCH SERVICES AND CONCURRENTLY THE COORDINATOR OF </p><p>THE UNDP PROJECT.  DUNG CLAIMED THAT EVEN HO CHI MINH </p><p>HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY, BUT </p><p>ADMITTED THAT ONLY IN THE PAST DECADE HAS THE SRV BEEN </p><p>"RETURNING" TO THIS PRINCIPLE AND SEEKING TO ENHANCE </p><p>THE "RULE OF LAW," BASED ON THE 1992 CONSTITUTION AND A </p><p>GROWING LEGAL FRAMEWORK.  HE NOTED THAT THIS PROCESS </p><p>WOULD "CLEARLY NEED TIME" AND WOULD NOT MIRROR THE US </p><p>SYSTEM, BUT WAS NONETHELESS NECESSARY TO MAKE VIETNAM </p><p>"MORE SUCCESSFUL" IN THE FUTURE.  HE COMPARED VIETNAM\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO BALANCE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT </p><p>TO "RIDING A BICYCLE" -- EASY TO FALL OVER IF THE EXACT </p><p>BALANCE IS NOT MAINTAINED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  DUNG NOTED THAT WHILE VIETNAM\'S REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>DEMOCRACY WAS MORE INDIRECT THAN THE US MODEL, THE SRV </p><p>WAS NOW COMMITTED TO "PUTTING MORE SUBSTANCE IN THE </p><p>STRUCTURE" OF BOTH THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS.  HE EXPLICITLY REFERRED TO THIS </p><p>PROCESS AS "DEVOLUTION OF POWER" (PHAN QUYEN), WITH THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY INCREASINGLY "SHARING" ITS POWER WITH </p><p>THE LOCAL COUNCILS.  HE SAID THAT DILEMMA NOW -- WHICH </p><p>THE UNDP PROJECT HELPS TO ADDRESS -- IS HOW TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02964  01 OF 03  140146Z </p><p>DETERMINE THE "BEST FORMULA" AND TIMING.  HE CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THERE WOULD BE "CHAOS" IF THERE WERE A "LUMP SUM" </p><p>DEVOLUTION OF POWER, AND THAT CENTRAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>SOMETIMES EVEN HAD A HARD TIME "CONVINCING" LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO ACCEPT GREATER RESPONSIBILITY.  HE CITED </p><p>THE MAJOR CONSTRAINTS TO THIS PROCESS AS THE </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF FULL-TIME STAFF FOR THESE BODIES AND </p><p>THE CAPACITY OF THE DEPUTIES THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ACCORDING TO DUNG, LOCAL COUNCILS HAD </p><p>VIRTUALLY NO POWERS IN THE PAST, NOR DID THEY HAVE MUCH </p><p>ACCESS TO LOCAL REVENUES.  PRIORITY EFFORTS NOW WILL BE </p><p>ON GRANTING PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS MORE AUTHORITY, </p><p>ESPECIALLY OVER BUDGET AND PERSONNEL DECISIONS.  HE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS A RISK THAT THE LOCALITIES </p><p>WOULD USE THIS INCREASED AUTHORITY "UNWISELY."  HE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE PROCESS OF DEVOLUTION WAS NOT </p><p>IRREVERSIBLE IF EXPERIENCE SHOWED THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>"SUCCESSFUL."  FOR THE TIME BEING, HOWEVER, THE CLEAR </p><p>"HOPE" OF THE SRV WAS THAT DEVOLUTION WOULD CONTINUE </p><p>AND BENEFIT BOTH LOCAL AND NATIONAL INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>VIEW FROM THE PROVINCES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ACCORDING TO BINH THUAN PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN </p><p>HUYNH TAN THANH, NO NEW POLICY OF "DEVOLUTION" WAS </p><p>UNDERWAY, ALTHOUGH THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL HAD </p><p>BEEN GAINING MORE AND MORE AUTHORITY EVERY YEAR OVER </p><p>THE PAST DECADE.  KHANH HOA PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN PHAM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02964  02 OF 03  140146Z </p><p>VAN CHI NOTED THAT THE BASIC ROLE OF THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COUNCIL REMAINED TO CONVEY THE OPINIONS OF "THE PEOPLE" </p><p>TO THE PROVINCIAL COMMITTEE.  KHANH HOA PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COUNCIL VICE CHAIRMAN DR. LE XUAN THAN SAID THAT WHAT </p><p>WAS UNDERWAY WAS NOT SO MUCH "DEVOLUTION" AS </p><p>"STRENGTHENING" (TANG CUONG) THE ROLE OF THE COUNCILS </p><p>SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER "ANSWER TO THE PEOPLE."  HE </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL HAS HAD THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OF EXAMINING AND APPROVING THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL BUDGET SINCE 1992, SUBJECT TO NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY REVIEW.  BEGINNING IN 2002, HE SAID, THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL COUNCIL WILL HAVE EVEN MORE INDEPENDENT </p><p>AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF BINH DINH PROVINCE\'S </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL SEPARATELY NOTED THAT "ELEVATING" THE </p><p>POWERS OF THE COUNCILS AT PROVINCIAL, DISTRICT AND </p><p>TOWNSHIP LEVELS WAS IMPORTANT, BUT HE MAINTAINED THAT </p><p>THEY TECHNICALLY HAD THE POWER TO "DECIDE" BUDGET AND </p><p>PERSONNEL ISSUES ALREADY.  HE NOTED THAT THE COUNCILS </p><p>WERE MORE INTENT ON STRENGTHENING THEIR "INVESTIGATIVE" </p><p>ROLES, ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE ACTIVITIES OR </p><p>DECISIONS OF THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES.  (COMMENT:  THERE </p><p>IS SOME OVERLAPPING OF SEATS, WITH SOME PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR LEADERS SIMULTANEOUSLY SERVING AS </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL MEMBERS OR LEADERS, MAKING SUCH </p><p>ENHANCED OVERSIGHT FRAUGHT WITH DIFFICULTIES.  END </p><p>COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  QUANG NAM PROVINCIAL VICE CHAIRMAN HO THI </p><p>THANH LAM ALSO INSISTED THAT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02964  02 OF 03  140146Z </p><p>CHANGE TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL </p><p>REGARDING BUDGETARY AFFAIRS, EXCEPT THAT REPORTING </p><p>REQUIREMENTS TO THE CENTER WERE FEWER NOW.  THE VICE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF QUANG BINH\'S PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL </p><p>NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND STATE </p><p>WERE COMMITTED TO "STRENGHTENING THE POWERS" OF THE </p><p>COUNCILS.  HE ADDED THAT, BEGINNING IN 2002, THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD ONLY CONCERN ITSELF WITH THE </p><p>NATIONAL BUDGET AND WOULD ENTRUST BUDGETARY AUTHORITY </p><p>TO THE PROVINCIAL, DISTRICT, AND TOWNSHIP COUNCILS FOR </p><p>THEIR AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  NGHE AN PROVINCIAL VICE CHAIRMAN HOANG TY </p><p>SEPARATELY SAID THAT PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS WOULD HAVE "MORE </p><p>POWER IN ALLOCATING FUNDS" BEGINNING IN 2002 BUT </p><p>MAINTAINED THAT THE COUNCILS ALREADY HAD THE LEGAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO APPROVE BUDGETS.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>COMPLEXITY ON THIS ISSUE STEMS IN PART FROM HAVING SO </p><p>MUCH OF LOCAL BUDGETS IN THE FORM OF SALARIES FOR </p><p>OFFICIALS -- WHICH ARE FIXED BY THE CENTER BUT </p><p>TECHNICALLY PAID OUT OF LOCAL BUDGETS -- OR MANDATED BY </p><p>THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL PROJECTS SUCH AS ROAD BUILDING </p><p>OR EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>HOW THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILS ACTUALLY WORK </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.   (U)  LIKE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>COUNCILS ARE NOT FULL-TIME BODIES;  ALMOST ALL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES HAVE OTHER JOBS.  THEY, AS WELL AS </p><p>THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE DISTRICT AND TOWNSHIP LEVEL, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02964  02 OF 03  140146Z </p><p>ARE EXPECTED TO SPEND TIME IN-BETWEEN MEETINGS TO </p><p>CANVASS LOCAL OPINION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE ACCURATELY TO </p><p>"EXPRESS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE."  THE NUMBER OF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES IS BASED ON POPULATION SIZE AND IS </p><p>ADJUSTED EVERY FIVE YEARS, THE TERM OF OFFICE FOR </p><p>PROVINCIAL REPRESENTATIVES.  THIS TERM IS NOT </p><p>CONCURRENT WITH THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, WHICH WILL HOLD </p><p>NEW ELECTIONS IN 2002.  MOST PROVINCES ALONG ROUTE ONE </p><p>WILL HAVE THEIR NEXT ELECTIONS FOR PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS IN </p><p>2004.  MOST OF THESE PROVINCES HAVE BETWEEN 40-50 </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES IN THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>POPULOUS NGHE AN HAS OVER 80.  PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS </p><p>UNIFORMLY CLAIMED THAT REPRESENTATIVES -- AT LEAST AT </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL -- HAD HIGH EDUCATIONAL </p><p>QUALIFICATIONS, WITH VIRTUALLY ALL HAVING AT LEAST A </p><p>HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE AND A LARGE NUMBER WITH UNIVERSITY </p><p>BACKGROUNDS.  THEY ADMITTED THAT THIS IS LESS TRUE AT </p><p>THE DISTRICT OR TOWNSHIP LEVEL, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS DESCRIBED HOW THE </p><p>ONGOING WORK OF PROVINCIAL COUNCILS IS CARRIED ON BY </p><p>THE CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIRMEN, WHO ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO </p><p>HOLD THE SAME POSITIONS IN THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE (A </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF A PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE COULD IN THEORY BE AND </p><p>OFTEN IN REALITY IS A VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COUNCIL, FOR EXAMPLE).  IN MOST OF THE PROVINCES ALONG </p><p>ROUTE ONE, THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILS MEET ONLY TWICE A </p><p>YEAR.  QUANG NAM\'S PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL BEGAN MEETING FOUR </p><p>TIMES A YEAR IN 2000, WITH "GOOD RESULTS," ACCORDING TO </p><p>PROVINCIAL VICE CHAIRMAN LAM.  NGHE AN\'S PROVINCIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02964  03 OF 03  140146Z </p><p>COUNCIL ALSO HAS BEGUN QUARTERLY MEETINGS.  THE VICE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF QUANG BINH\'S PROVINCIAL COUNCIL CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THERE WAS OFTEN "HEATED DISCUSSION" AMONG </p><p>DELEGATES DURING ITS SESSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  ALL PROVINCIAL COUNCILS HAVE COMMITTEES ON </p><p>ECONOMIC AND BUDGETARY AFFAIRS;  CULTURAL AND SOCIAL </p><p>AFFAIRS; AND JUDICIAL AFFAIRS.  THOSE PROVINCES, LIKE </p><p>NGHE AN, WITH SIGNIFICANT ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS, </p><p>ALSO HAVE A COMMITTEE ON ETHNIC AFFAIRS.  THESE </p><p>COMMITTEES ARE MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES AND TYPICALLY </p><p>HAVE NO PROFESSIONAL OR FULL-TIME STAFF.  ALL </p><p>PROVINCIAL COUNCILS HAVE A SUPPORT OFFICE, WHICH IN </p><p>MOST CASES IS SHARED WITH THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE.  OFFICIALS USUALLY CLAIMED THAT THIS SET-UP </p><p>TENDS TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE </p><p>LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCHES.  QUANG BINH\'S </p><p>PROVINCIAL COUNCIL SET UP A SEPARATE OFFICE IN 1994, </p><p>HOWEVER.  MOST OFFICIALS ADMITTED THE NEED FOR MORE </p><p>SUPPORT PERSONNEL FOR THE COUNCILS, WHETHER IN A SHARED </p><p>OFFICE OR A SEPARATE OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  NGHE AN PROVINCIAL VICE CHAIRMAN TY EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT A PRIMARY TASK FOR LOCAL COUNCILS IS TO "PROTECT </p><p>UNITY."  TO DO SO NOWADAYS, HE NOTED, REQUIRED THAT THE </p><p>PEOPLE NEED TO "SEE MORE AND MORE LOCAL POWER," AND </p><p>THAT THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS UNDERTAKE MORE MEASURES TO </p><p>"MAKE SURE THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE ARE HEARD."  HE </p><p>POINTED TO THE ONGOING "STRUGGLE" TO IMPROVE THE </p><p>QUALITY OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR PERFORMANCE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN MINORITY AREAS.  HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02964  03 OF 03  140146Z </p><p>PERHAPS LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF PROVINCIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES WERE NOW PARTY MEMBERS, SINCE AN </p><p>UNEXPECTED NUMBER OF PARTY MEMBERS LOST THEIR SEATS IN </p><p>THE LAST ELECTION DUE TO POPULAR DISSATISFACTION ABOUT </p><p>THEIR SERVICE.  HE INSISTED THAT PARTY MEMBERSHIP WAS </p><p>LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE ABILITY TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE </p><p>ACCURATELY AND WELL.   OTHER PROVINCES REPORTED THAT </p><p>AROUND 80 PCT OF DELEGATES ARE PARTY MEMBERS, A RATIO </p><p>SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, ACCORDING TO </p><p>DR. DUNG. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  COMMENT:  GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY AS KNOWN IN </p><p>THE US IS NOT FLOURISHING IN VIETNAM.  THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY\'S FIRM POLICY OF DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM AND ITS </p><p>LENINIST STRUCTURE MAKE THIS PROSPECT UNLIKELY. </p><p>HOWEVER, SRV AND VCP AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO RECOGNIZE </p><p>THE GROWING NEED TO ENLIVEN THE EXISTING CHANNELS FOR </p><p>EXPRESSION OF LOCAL VIEWS, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF </p><p>POPULAR AND OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED DISSATISFACTION </p><p>OVER CORRUPTION.  CENTRAL AUTHORITIES ALSO INCREASINGLY </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE IMPOSSIBILITY AND NON-DESIRABILITY OF </p><p>THE CENTER ATTEMPTING TO MAKE ALL DECISIONS DOWN TO THE </p><p>GRASSROOTS LEVEL.  THE ONGOING DEBATE OVER </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS (SEPTEL) REFLECT THESE </p><p>REALITIES, AS WILL PREPARATIONS FOR THE 2002 NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS.  IN THE ABSENCE OF SUFFICIENT </p><p>RESOURCES -- INCLUDING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY -- AND </p><p>WELL-TRAINED STAFF AND REPRESENTATIVES, STEPS TOWARD </p><p>MORE GENUINELY LOCAL AND TRULY REPRESENTATIVE DECISION- </p><p>MAKING WILL BE TIME-CONSUMING AND COMPLICATED.  IT IS </p><p>ALSO FAR FROM CERTAIN THAT SENIOR LEADERS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02964  03 OF 03  140146Z </p><p>VCP SECRETARY-GENERAL (AND FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY) NONG DUC MANH, HAVE A CLEAR VISION </p><p>OF THE EXACT OUTCOME THEY SEEK FROM THE NASCENT PROCESS </p><p>OF DEVOLUTION OF POWER TO AND/OR STRENGTHENING OF LOCAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BODIES. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
