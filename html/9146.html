<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 003044 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP (GLASS) </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT (FOX) </p><p>STATE FOR IO/PHO (PEREZ) </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/RA </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL AUFHAUSER </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC DIRECTOR NEWCOMB </p><p>TREASURY FOR DASS FOR TERRORISM AND VIOLENT CRIMES (ZARATE) </p><p>TREASURY FOR TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST FINANCING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETTC, PTER, PREL, PGOV, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCING: POST IN-HOUSE VIEWS ON </p><p>POTENTIAL HAMAS-LINKED TARGETS FOR ASSET FREEZE DESIGNATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A. STATE 194837 </p><p>     B. B. STATE 193410 </p><p>     C. C. KUWAIT 1221 </p><p>     D. D. STATE 79970 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PER REFTEL B DTG 030106Z JUL 03 </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary: Post-election Kuwait\'s somewhat defused </p><p>political environment offers greater latitude than before for </p><p>USG action.  Post confirms Ref C recommendation that absent </p><p>substantive evidence linking certain Islamic charities to </p><p>terrorist activity, USG interests might best be served via </p><p>collaboration with GOK oversight authorities and perhaps </p><p>select officials of the concerned charities as well.  Should </p><p>such efforts fail, E.O. 13224 designation immediately would </p><p>be appropriate.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) In response to Ref B request for update, Post </p><p>confirms Ref C core recommendations regarding the Social </p><p>Reform Society (Jamiyat al-Islah al-Ijtima \'Ikuwait) (SRS). </p><p>Absent substantive evidence of SRS key management witting </p><p>support for terrorism, USG might consider a direct approach </p><p>to SRS leadership.  This would follow consultation with the </p><p>GOK\'s new Office of Charity Oversight and Supervision (OCOS) </p><p>within the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.  A </p><p>collaborative review of our concerns, first with the GOK and </p><p>then, if appropriate, with responsible SRS leadership is the </p><p>preferred approach in our view. Concerns about the activities </p><p>of satellite offices, e.g., Amman, Jordan, could be addressed </p><p>simultaneously. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Post suggests a similar approach regarding the </p><p>International Islamic Charity Organization (IICO) (aka: </p><p>International Islamic Charitable Society) and its various </p><p>subsidiaries and associated entities.  IICO appears to have a </p><p>good reputation locally.  Absent substantive information </p><p>suggesting it inappropriate, a direct approach offers us </p><p>opportunity to test the feasibility of bringing on board </p><p>responsible elements within the OCOS and perhaps the </p><p>charities themselves. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) The post-election environment in Kuwait provides </p><p>USG greater latitude than earlier.  SRS\'s political arm, the </p><p>Islamic Constitutional Movement, lost four of its six </p><p>National Assembly seats on 5 July.  That cut in the charity\'s </p><p>political popularity and the onset of the summer vacation </p><p>doldrums present a more stable political environment than </p><p>that described in Ref C. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Should low-key pursuit of responsible action by the </p><p>charities\' leadership and the GOK oversight authorities fail, </p><p>immediate public designation under E.O. 13224 would become </p><p>Post\'s preference.  It is unclear to us now, however, what </p><p>special benefit could be gained by going public first without </p><p>at least having tried the collaborative and consultative </p><p>route that remains our preferred first option. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
