<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001169 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bush and Blair lied about Iraq" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its </p><p>      June 8 editorial to criticizing the United States-led war </p><p>      against Iraq, saying, "the invasion of Iraq was unjust." </p><p>      Adding: "Bush and Blair are shameless liars."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Statements by a senior U. S. defense official that </p><p>      Pentagon had `no reliable information\' that Iraq had </p><p>      chemical and biological weapons have clearly left both the </p><p>      White House and Number 10 Downing Street with egg in the </p><p>      face. . .After nearly two months in which British and U. S. </p><p>      troops have occupied huge swaths of Iraq, detaining and </p><p>      interrogating leading Ba\'athist officials and scientists, </p><p>      no trace has been found of any chemical and biological </p><p>      weapons arsenal. . .Global opinion appears to be vindicated </p><p>      in its criticism of the unjustified attack on Iraq.  As </p><p>      Bush and Blair, along with the Australians, renew their </p><p>      hunt for Iraq\'s elusive WMDs, the world remains firm in its </p><p>      conviction that the invasion of Iraq was unjust and that </p><p>      Bush and Blair are shameless liars." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
