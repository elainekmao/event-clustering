<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 000313 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI TRIAL:  BEN-MENASHE CROSS-EXAMINATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 259 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The treason trial of Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC) officials Morgan Tsvangirai, Welshman Ncube, and Renson </p><p>Gasela entered its eighth day on February 12.  Since February </p><p>6, defense counsel has subjected the state\'s star witness, </p><p>Ari Ben-Menashe, to an intensive cross-examination, a process </p><p>which has not yet concluded.    Lead defense attorney George </p><p>Bizos has questioned Ben-Menashe about a number of contracts </p><p>with foreign governments which he apparently did not fulfill </p><p>but for which he nonetheless received payments.  Presiding </p><p>judge Paddington Garwe has ruled that Ben-Menashe must answer </p><p>questions -- in camera -- regarding the contract he signed </p><p>with the Government of Zimbabwe, specifically what payments </p><p>he received for what activities.  Ben-Menashe has engaged in </p><p>outrageous behavior in court, dismissing questions he did not </p><p>want to answer and using inappropriate language, but the </p><p>histrionics have played into Bizos\'s successful attempts to </p><p>portray the witness as an unscrupulous conman. </p><p> </p><p>Ben-Menashe\'s contract with Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) As reported reftel, Ben-Menashe had acknowledged </p><p>signing a contract with the Government of Zimbawe for </p><p>provision of public relations services on January 10, 2002, </p><p>shortly after the infamous videotape of MDC leader Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai was made public, and that he had received </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>U.S.$400,000 for services rendered.  On February 7, defense </p><p>counsel George Bizos asked Ben-Menashe to clarify what </p><p>services he had provided.  Ben-Menashe declined to answer, </p><p>citing confidentiality, sparking two days of arguments by </p><p>both sides as to whether he could be compelled to answer that </p><p>question.  On February 10, the prosecutor produced a letter </p><p>from Minister of State for National Security Nicholas Goche </p><p>stating that forcing Ben-Menashe to discuss the contract </p><p>details would compromise Zimbabwe\'s national security.  Bizos </p><p>countered with an argument that excluding such testimony </p><p>would violate his clients\' constitutional right to a fair </p><p>trial.  On the morning of February 12, Judge Garwe finally </p><p>ruled that Ben-Menashe would have to testify regarding this </p><p>contract but that, given the potential damage to national </p><p>security, cross-examination would take place in camera.   The </p><p>courtroom was immediately cleared of outside observers and, </p><p>as of midday on February 12, the trial was proceeding in </p><p>camera. </p><p> </p><p>Unfulfilled contracts with governments </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Bizos has successfully used much of his </p><p>cross-examination to impugn Ben-Menashe\'s credibility.  One </p><p>particular focus has been contracts signed between CSC, a </p><p>company led by Ben-Menashe, and a number of foreign </p><p>governments for provision of grains.  Ben-Menashe admitted, </p><p>for instance, signing a contract with Zambia to provide corn. </p><p> He insisted, however, that no corn was ever delivered </p><p>because the contract was terminated by the Government of </p><p>Zambia, and that the U.S.$7 million he received from the </p><p>Government of Zambia was for provision of other services -- </p><p>which he refused to specify.   Asked to comment on a </p><p>significant judgment issued against him in the London court </p><p>of arbitration for failing to fulfill that contract, </p><p>Ben-Menashe merely repeated several times that "that was </p><p>because we had no legal counsel present."  Asked whether he </p><p>had signed a contract to provide wheat to Belorussia, </p><p>Ben-Menashe said "no," but did acknowledge, after being </p><p>pressed, that that topic had been discussed.  Bizos asked </p><p>whether CSC had been paid U.S.$300,000 from the government of </p><p>Belorussia, Ben-Menashe answered in the affirmative but </p><p>insisted the payment was for other services provided.  What </p><p>services had he provided for that payment, Bizos asked.  He </p><p>was not at liberty to say, Ben-Menashe replied.  Asked why </p><p>not if it had been for legitimate purposes, Ben-Menashe said </p><p>"sometimes governments don\'t want such information to become </p><p>public." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Ben-Menashe acknowledged being paid U.S.$262,000 by </p><p>the Merchant Bank in Scotland for delivery of rice to Ghana. </p><p>Asked whether that rice had ever been delivered, Ben-Menashe </p><p>claimed that it was immediately returned when the deal "went </p><p>sour."   Asked how long he had kept that money before </p><p>returning it, Ben-Menashe claimed not to remember.  Bizos </p><p>inquired whether the bank in Scotland had instituted legal </p><p>proceedings against CSC to reclaim its money.  Yes, </p><p>Ben-Menashe replied, but that had been "a mistake." </p><p>MDC-Dickens & Madson contract </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) Bizos also focused on the contract signed between </p><p>Ben-Menashe, on behalf of Dickens and Madson, and the MDC, in </p><p>which Dickens and Madson undertook to strengthen the MDC\'s </p><p>international linkages and improve the party\'s international </p><p>image.   Ben-Menashe insisted that Rupert Johnson -- who </p><p>introduced him to the defendants -- was not a director of </p><p>Dickens and Madson, as indicated on the contract, and said </p><p>the contract had been drawn up by Johnson and presented to </p><p>him.  Why then, Bizos asked, had Ben-Menashe signed a </p><p>contract in which Johnson was listed as a company director? </p><p>Ben-Menashe replied that he hadn\'t read the contract </p><p>carefully.  Did Ben-Menashe normally sign contracts involving </p><p>large sums of money without reading them?  "Sometimes" was </p><p>the reply.  If Johnson were not an employee of Dickens and </p><p>Madson, Bizos continued, why would he draw up a contract </p><p>promising to put U.S.$20,000 in Dickens and Madson\'s bank </p><p>acount as an advance payment?  "Why don\'t you go ask him?" </p><p>Ben-Menashe retorted.    Bizos asked whether  Ben-Menashe had </p><p>claimed to Rupert Johnson that he was "loyal" to the GOZ and </p><p>said that Mugabe was his friend.  ABM acknowledged saying </p><p>only that he knew Mugabe, that he sympathized with the GOZ\'s </p><p>land reform program, and that he knew a number of senior GOZ </p><p>officials from his previous work in Zimbabwe.  If Ben-Menashe </p><p>was so open about his close relationship to the GOZ, Bizos </p><p>asked, why would the MDC have trusted him to carry out an </p><p>assassination plan against Mugabe?   Ben-Menashe, not </p><p>surprisingly, had no convincing reply. </p><p> </p><p>Garwe\'s conduct </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ben-Menashe continues to put on quite a show in the </p><p>witness box, screaming at Bizos when asked questions he </p><p>doesn\'t want to answer, interrupting Garwe, and using </p><p>inappropriate language, including calling Tsvangirai a </p><p>"scumbag."  Garwe appears to be treating him with kid gloves, </p><p>reminding him often -- but meekly -- that he is in a </p><p>courtroom and needs to act appropriately.  Garwe seems </p><p>uncomfortable and unsure of how to proceed on some points -- </p><p>for instance, it was unclear to most observers why he had to </p><p>ajourn for 45 minutes on the first day to determine whether </p><p>diplomats, journalists, members of the general public, and </p><p>MDC officials should be permitted inside.   Bizos asked the </p><p>judge to order Ben-Menashe to answer the question regarding </p><p>what services he had provided to the GOZ for the U.S.$400,000 </p><p>payment.  Garwe said he could order Ben-Menashe to do so but </p><p>threw up his hands and asked what he could he do if the </p><p>witness refused to comply, an appalling answer for a judge </p><p>who is supposed to have absolute authority in the courtroom. </p><p>On the positive side, Ben-Menashe was not permitted to depart </p><p>as he had hoped the evening of February 7 and it seems as </p><p>though the defense will not be preempted from conducting a </p><p>comprehensive cross-examination. </p><p> </p><p>Access </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  It appears as though most interested parties are </p><p>being admitted to the courtroom to witness the trial. </p><p>Diplomats and independent journalists are present for every </p><p>session, and members of the general public are now being </p><p>granted access.  A number of seats continue to be filled by </p><p>members of the security services. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Ben-Menashe has been the state\'s worst enemy, and no </p><p>informed observers -- particularly those privileged enough to </p><p>witness his behavior in court -- believe that Tsvangirai and </p><p>his co-defendants approached him to arrange Mugabe\'s </p><p>assassination.  Now that the state\'s case seems to be falling </p><p>apart, it will be interesting to see whether other prominent </p><p>names on the state\'s witness list -- including Air Force </p><p>Commander Perence Shiri -- will be willing to sully their </p><p>names by appearing on the stand in support of these obviously </p><p>manufactured charges.  Given that the defense has not yet </p><p>completed its cross-examination of the state\'s first witness, </p><p>this trial could continue for many more weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
