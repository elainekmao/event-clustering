<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 008116 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  01/01/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU, IS, PA </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAITI GOVT FUNDING HAMAS:  "NOT ONE PENNY" </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY THE AMBASSADOR.  REASON 1.5. D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  DURING A CALL BY CONGRESSMAN ROHRABACHER ON FONMIN </p><p>SABAH TODAY, THE CONGRESSMAN TOLD SHAYKH SABAH THAT CHAIRMAN ARAFAT </p><p>HAD TOLD A SENIOR CONGRESSMAN YESTERDAY IN WASHINGTON THAT THE </p><p>KUWAITI GOVERNMENT WAS PROVIDING FUNDING FOR HAMAS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SHAYKH SABAH RESPONDED WITH SOME EMOTION, UNDERLINING THAT HE </p><p>COULD ASSURE US THAT "NOT ONE PENNY" OF KUWAITI GOVERNMENT FUNDS HAD </p><p>GONE TO HAMAS.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT HE COULD PROVIDE NO SUCH </p><p>ASSURANCE OF KUWAITI PRIVATE SUPPORT FOR HAMAS, WHICH COULD NOT REALLY </p><p>BE CONTROLLED BY THE GOK.  HE NOTED THAT KUWAITIS PROVIDED FUNDING NOT </p><p>SO MUCH OUT OF SYMPATHY FOR HAMAS AS OUT OF HATRED FOR ARAFAT FOR HIS </p><p>STAND DURING THE GULF WAR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COMMENT:  AS WE REPORTED DURING SHAYKH YASSIN\'S VISIT </p><p>HERE EARLIER THIS YEAR, CONSIDERABLE KUWAITI PRIVATE FUND RAISING </p><p>FOR HAMAS DOES OCCUR, BUT WE ALSO HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF OFFICIAL </p><p>FUNDS GOING TO HIM.  (IT IS WORTH NOTING ALSO, HOWEVER, THAT SHAYKH </p><p>SABAH IS NO FRIEND OF HAMAS AND TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO BLOCK </p><p>YASSIN\'S VISIT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LAROCCO </p><p></p></div>
