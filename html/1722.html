IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ADRESSEES WILL HAVE SEEN PRESS REPORTING OF THE </p><p>DEATH MAY 26 OF MINISTER OF DEFENSE MOVEN MAHACHI. </p><p>MAHACHI WAS IN THE BACK SEAT OF A HEAVILY LOADED LAND </p><p>ROVER DISCOVERY THAT WAS HIT BROADSIDE BY A CAR WHOSE </p><p>DRIVER WAS REPORTEDLY DRUNK.  THE IMPACT CAUSED THE </p><p>MINISTER\'S VEHICLE TO ROLL AND THE TALL MAHACHI, WHO WAS </p><p>SITTING HIGHER THAN OTHER PASSENGERS, WAS KILLED </p><p>INSTANTLY WHEN THE CAR\'S ROOF COLLAPSED ON HIS HEAD, </p><p>ACCORDINQ TO EGYPTIAN DCM KADRI ABDEL-MOTTALEB, WHO </p><p>HEARD THE ACCOUNT OF ARMY COMMANDER CONSTANTINE </p><p>CHIWENGA.  POLICE HAVE TAKEN PAINS TO SAY THAT THERE WAS </p><p>NOTHING SINISTER ABOUT THE CRASH, A WAY OF DYINQ LONQ </p><p>ASSOCIATED HERE WITH ZANU-PF POLITICAL ASSASSINATION. </p><p>MAHACHI\'S DEMISE IN A ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENT IS THE </p><p>SECOND IN A MONTH (MINISTER OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, GENDER </p><p>AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION BORDER GEZI WAS KILLED ON APRIL </p><p>28) AND HAS LEFT PRESIDENT MUGABE REELING.  THE LATE </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER WAS ONE OF THE ZANU-PF "OLD GUARD," WHO </p><p>FOUGHT SIDE-HY-SIDE WITH MUQABE IN MOZAMBIQUE AND WAS A </p><p>MEMBER OF HIS DELEGATION AT THE LANCASTER HOUSE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01727  01 OF 02  291521Z </p><p>2.  (C) MAHACHI\'S DEATH CREATED THE THIRD CABINET </p><p>VACANCY IN A MONTH (MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE NKOSANA MOYO RESIGNED SUDDENLY IN </p><p>EARLY MAY).  IN ZIMBABWE DEPUTY MINISTERS DO NOT </p><p>AUTOMATICALLY SUBSTITUTE THEIR MINISTERS.  MUGABE, WHO </p><p>IN THE PAST HAS BEEN KNOWN TO PUT OFF MAKING DECISIONS </p><p>ON CABINET APPOINTMENTS UNTIL THE URGENCY OF EVENTS </p><p>FORCES HIM TO TAKE ACTION, MUST BE FEELING THE PRESSURE </p><p>TO PUT TOGETHER A NEW TEAM.  BOTH GEZI AND MAHACHI WERE </p><p>ELECTED MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND THEIR VACANT SEATS </p><p>MUST BE FILLED WITH A BY-ELECTION.  FORMER INDUSTRY </p><p>MINISTER MOYO -- WHO WAS NOT AN ELECTED MEMBER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT -- DID NOT HAVE A DEPUTY; THE MINISTRY IS </p><p>BEING TEMPORARILY HEADED BY THE PERMANENT SECRETARY, </p><p>STUART COMBERBACH.  COMBERBACH, ONE OF THE FEW SENIOR </p><p>WHITES REMAINING IN GOVERNMENT, IS A COMPETENT </p><p>TECHNOCRAT BUT, THOUGH CLOSE TO RETIRED ZANU-PF STALWART </p><p>NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA, IS SEEN AS A POLITICAL LIGHTWEIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AT THIS WRITING WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE ABOUT WHOM </p><p>MUGABE WILL PLACE IN THESE VACANCIES.  LAST JUNE THE NEW </p><p>CABINET HE ROLLED OUT APPEARED MEANT TO IMPRESS THE </p><p>WORLD THAT ZIMBABWE WAS READY TO TACKLE ITS ECONOMIC AND </p><p>POLITICAL PROBLEMS.  THIS YEAR WE WOULD WAGER THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT WILL PLACE A PREMIUM ON LOYALTY FOR </p><p>HIS APPOINTMENTS, AND WILL AIM TO SELECT THOSE WILLING </p><p>TO DO EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO ENSURE HIS REELECTION IN </p><p>2002.  WE DOUBT, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT DEPUTY MINISTER OF </p><p>YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, GENDER AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION SHUVAI </p><p>MAHOFA WILL BE PROMOTED TO MINISTER, AS SHE IS PERCEIVED </p><p>TO HAVE GOTTEN THE PORTFOLIO FOR BEING A PROTEGEE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01727  01 OF 02  291521Z </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT MUZENDA.  SOME OBSERVERS PREDICT THE </p><p>MINISTRY MIGHT GO TO OLIVIA MUCHENA, CURRENTLY MINISTER </p><p>OF STATE IN VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA\'S OFFICE.  FILLING THE </p><p>DEFENSE PORTFOLIO IS ONE THAT WILL REQUIRE CONSULTATION </p><p>WITH THE CHIEFS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND ONE IN WHICH </p><p>SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, WHOSE </p><p>COMMERCIAL BIDDING IN THE CONGO MAHACHI DID, WILL BE </p><p>INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN VETTING.  IN ANY CASE, BALANCING </p><p>CROSS-CUTTING POLITICAL AND REGIONAL RIVALRIES, </p><p>CURRENTLY TEARING ZANU-PF APART, WILL BE FOREMOST ON THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S MIND AS HE ASSEMBLES HIS NEW CABINET. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MUGABE WILL BE HARD-PRESSED TO FIND SUPPORTERS </p><p>AS UNQUESTIONINGLY ENTHUSIASTIC AS GEZI AND MAHACHI.  IT </p><p>IS POSSIBLE THAT, GIVEN HIS PENCHANT FOR SPRINGING </p><p>SURPRISES, THE ZIMBABWEAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE COULD PROMOTE </p><p>A WAR VETERAN LEADER AS DEFENSE MINISTER IN A NOD TO </p><p>THAT CONSTITUENCY\'S CURRENT IMPORTANCE, ALTHOUGH </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION WAR VETERANS\' ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT </p><p>CHENJERAI HUNZVI IS SERIOUSLY ILL AND NOT EXPECTED TO </p><p>RECOVER HIS HEALTH.  THE SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS WHO </p><p>COMPRISE ZANU-PF\'S GANGSTER MILITIA, HOWEVER, WOULD NOT </p><p>COMMAND THE RESPECT OF PROFESSIONAL MILITARY OFFICERS, </p><p>WHO CONSIDER HUNZVI AND HIS ILK UNDISCIPLINED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1951 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01727  02 OF 02  291521Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------F1C6FA  291521Z /38 </p><p>O 291522Z MAY 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8976 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001727 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SA - C.

REGARDLESS OF WHOM HE ULTIMATELY CHOOSES </p><p>FOR THE THREE CABINET POSTS, WE HAVE NO DOUBT THAT </p><p>MUGABE WILL IMPOSE ORDER FROM THE TOP AND PROLONG ZANU- </p><p>PF\'S PATHOLOGY.  AS THE PARTY HAS NEITHER CARROTS TO </p><p>OFFER THE POPULATION NOR A TRACK RECORD ON WHICH TO RUN, </p><p>WE PREDICT THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT WILL UNLEASH </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF VIOLENCE ON THE POPULATION TO </p><p>COMPENSATE FOR THE VULNERABILITY HE IS FEELING.  WITH </p><p>MAHACHI AND GEZI NOW CONSIGNED TO THE ASH HEAP OF </p><p>HISTORY, AND HUNZVI NOT FAR BEHIND, WE WILL HAVE TO </p><p>WATCH CLOSELY TO SEE WHETHER MUGABE IS ABLE TO FIND </p><p>OTHERS WILLING TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE WITH </p><p>AS MUCH RELISH. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
