<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 003256 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 09/23/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, SOCI, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO SUPPORTS CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT, PLEDGES TO FUND INEC </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During a November 20 meeting with </p><p>USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios and Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, President Obasanjo endorsed an all-parties Code </p><p>of Conduct and promised to honor INEC\'s 27 billion </p><p>Naira (USD 210 million) 2003 elections funding </p><p>request.  Obasanjo expressed confidence that electoral </p><p>violence would be contained. He downplayed criticism </p><p>of the voter registration exercise but stated that he </p><p>would press INEC to quicken logistical preparations </p><p>for the elections. Throughout the meeting both Natsios </p><p>and Jeter stressed the importance of free, fair and </p><p>peaceful elections not only for Nigeria but also for </p><p>Africa and initiatives like NEPAD. Obasanjo pledged to </p><p>do his utmost to ensure that the elections would be </p><p>credible. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>OBASANJO SAYS VIOLENCE WILL NOT DERAIL ELECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) After a quick overview of AID\'s programs and </p><p>presence, Administrator Natsios told President </p><p>Obasanjo that, while President Bush wanted to visit </p><p>Nigeria, it would be difficult to do so if there were </p><p>widespread violence associated with upcoming </p><p>elections. The Administrator stressed that President </p><p>Bush had explicitly asked him to relay these concerns </p><p>to his friend President Obasanjo. Obasanjo quipped </p><p>that much of the tension and uncertainty was generated </p><p>by people preoccupied about whether he would "come or </p><p>go".  More seriously, he admitted being "a little bit </p><p>concerned" about electoral violence but believed </p><p>"prospects were good" for containing it. Obasanjo </p><p>indicated government efforts to minimize violence were </p><p>beginning to bear fruit. To stem violence, the </p><p>security forces must have the clear mandate that all </p><p>violators should be arrested and none is above the </p><p>law, he posited. Obasanjo recalled police hesitation </p><p>at arresting a PDP senator who was caught interfering </p><p>with voter registration.  When the police explained </p><p>they feared arresting an elected member of the ruling </p><p>party, Obasanjo told them the senator should have been </p><p>among the first arrested in order to send a public </p><p>message that no one was above the law. (Comment: </p><p>Obasanjo\'s account is reassuring but also self- </p><p>serving.  We have not seen reports of a PDP senator </p><p>arrested for interference with the voter registration. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Obasanjo identified the Southeastern region </p><p>and Plateau State as troubled areas where he has </p><p>conferred with the affected governors about quashing </p><p>electoral violence.  In conjunction with the Anambra </p><p>and Abia states, the federal government has crack- </p><p>downed on the vigilante Bakassi Boys in those two </p><p>states.  Obasanjo pointed to Enugu State as the most </p><p>complex problem in the Southeast.  A few advisors </p><p>close to the Governor have been implicated in </p><p>violence.  Governor Nnamani had sworn noninvolvement; </p><p>however, it was apparent that Obasanjo had second </p><p>thoughts about the Governor\'s disavowal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Obasanjo predicted little violence in his </p><p>ethnic home base, the Southwest. The region would not </p><p>live up to its moniker as the "wild, wild West" as </p><p>long as the rival parties, the  "AD and PDP talk as </p><p>they should," he stated cryptically.  (Comment: </p><p>Obasanjo may have good reason to be sanguine about the </p><p>Southwest.  Apparently, he and the AD governors of the </p><p>six Southwest states are close to an electoral modus </p><p>vivendi whereby the Governors will support Obasanjo\'s </p><p>presidency if Obasanjo does not actively support the </p><p>PDP gubernatorial candidates in those states during </p><p>the general elections. Perhaps it was no coincidence </p><p>that the AD National Chairman was in the waiting room </p><p>when our group was leaving the Villa.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) When Administrator Natsios mentioned a Code of </p><p>Conduct as the best mechanism to elicit public </p><p>commitment to non-violence by all political parties, </p><p>Obasanjo enthusiastically endorsed the idea and asked </p><p>that we help Nigeria establish such a Code.  Obasanjo </p><p>continued that the National Assembly had recently </p><p>rejected an electoral violence bill he had proposed. </p><p>It was considered "too harsh" by those members who </p><p>thought it could be used against them. The bill, he </p><p>explained, provided that any elected official could be </p><p>investigated for participation in electoral violence </p><p>but would only be tried after leaving office.  The </p><p>measure also contained a provision for restitution by </p><p>the wrongdoer to those harmed by his misconduct. </p><p>Apparently undaunted by the Assembly\'s prior </p><p>rejection, Obasanjo asserted that he would resubmit </p><p>the bill. After Ambassador Jeter stressed the </p><p>usefulness of all parties gathering to publicly </p><p>renounce violence, Obasanjo nodded at the suggestion, </p><p>saying he would get the parties to agree to such an </p><p>event. (Comment: The impetus behind the violence bill </p><p>was laudable but the measure was poorly written. Some </p><p>lawmakers reasonably feared that overzealous security </p><p>forces might abuse its overbroad language to stifle </p><p>the political campaigns of non-office holders. End </p><p>Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>INEC -- ELECTION PREPARATIONS AND FUNDING </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) During the meeting Administrator Natsios </p><p>repeatedly voiced concern about INEC logistical </p><p>preparations for the elections.  Time was getting </p><p>short; INEC needed to quicken the pace of ordering </p><p>essential material like ballot boxes and paper. </p><p>Obasanjo replied that INEC could use the boxes from </p><p>the 1999 contests. When Ambassador Jeter mentioned the </p><p>current stock might be insufficient for next year\'s </p><p>elections, Obasanjo seemed genuinely surprised.  He </p><p>stated he would talk to INEC Chairman Guobadia about </p><p>its logistical planning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Obasanjo declared that funding INEC was </p><p>"priority number one". Press reports were inaccurate </p><p>that INEC requested 36 billion Naira (USD 275 million) </p><p>in its supplemental budget. The INEC supplemental was </p><p>27 billion (7 billion Naira to pay for September </p><p>voters registration exercise, 20 billion Naira for </p><p>balloting material and 300 million for party </p><p>registration). He instructed the Finance Minister to </p><p>fund the request completely and immediately lest he be </p><p>threatened with impeachment again, Obasanjo joked. He </p><p>added that he also was intent to recover the 21 </p><p>million Naira lost in a scandal regarding the INEC </p><p>legal department that was discovered several months </p><p>ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Regarding voter registration, Obasanjo\'s did </p><p>not seem to understand that many, if not most, </p><p>Nigerians saw the exercise as flawed. Responding to </p><p>Natsios\'s question, Obasanjo discounted claims of </p><p>widespread under-registration and stated that those </p><p>who were unable to register could submit a claim </p><p>during the normal five day review period following the </p><p>publication of the voters roll by INEC. Somewhat </p><p>contradicting himself, however, he said that </p><p>politicians bought and hoarded forms believing that </p><p>they could stack the voter lists in their favor by </p><p>having loyalists only complete the forms. Otherwise, </p><p>he said, there was no reason for a shortage of forms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Obasanjo felt the security features in the </p><p>computerization process of the forms would winnow the </p><p>resultant multiple registrations out of the system. </p><p>The President then described a demonstration of the </p><p>thumbprint analysis that INEC was employing to detect </p><p>multiple registrations. He was confident the </p><p>computerized thumbprint analysis, conducted at each </p><p>stage of tabulation from the ward to the national </p><p>level, would detect multiple registrations by the same </p><p>person. (Comment: Obasanjo\'s explanation that under- </p><p>registration was not a major problem is unconvincing. </p><p>Politicians illegally hoarding forms could have </p><p>precluded numbers of innocent, eligible voters from </p><p>registering. His statements suggest the President has </p><p>been paying more attention to catching fraudulent </p><p>registrants than in remedying the inability of </p><p>innocent citizens to register. Even there, however, </p><p>his confidence in INEC\'s security features might be </p><p>too high.  End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Natsios emphasized that the coming elections </p><p>were not only important to Nigeria and the bilateral </p><p>relationship, but also to Africa and to such </p><p>continental initiatives like NEPAD. Western nations </p><p>would view the quality of Nigerian elections as a </p><p>barometer of commitment of Africa\'s largest nation to </p><p>the good governance objectives of NEPAD. Meanwhile, </p><p>other African countries would view the elections as a </p><p>good or bad precedent to follow. Obasanjo cautioned </p><p>that Washington must not view the process entirely </p><p>through a Western optic. Understanding of Nigeria\'s </p><p>background was important. For example, increased </p><p>communal violence in the past years, ironically, was a </p><p>by-product of democracy.  Before 1999, the military </p><p>brutally suppressed but did nothing to resolve </p><p>underlying communal problems.  The advent of democracy </p><p>and its concomitant freedoms have allowed people to </p><p>express themselves, sometimes violently. Obasanjo </p><p>maintained the frequent communal violence in Plateau </p><p>State was inevitable because tensions had been there </p><p>for a long time but military suppression kept these </p><p>fractures hidden.  As a democratically elected leader, </p><p>Obasanjo said that he could not employ the same </p><p>tactics.  Instead, at his urging, Plateau Governor </p><p>Dariye was spending more time talking to the rival </p><p>communities. The violence was slowly abating, Obasanjo </p><p>claimed. </p><p>11. (C) Pointing to the Yoruba greeting practice of </p><p>youth prostrating before elders as an example, </p><p>Obasanjo contended important cultural differences </p><p>would mark differences in democratic practices in </p><p>Nigeria and the West. Natsios emphasized that the </p><p>NEPAD good governance standards were not Western </p><p>imports but were authored by Obasanjo and other </p><p>African leaders.  Visibly warming to this topic, </p><p>Obasanjo cited the example of corruption as an </p><p>abhorrent dysfunction that unfortunately had gotten a </p><p>foothold in Nigeria\'s political economy.  While </p><p>corruption was not part of traditional culture, time </p><p>would be needed to uproot it from the political </p><p>system. Likewise, eliminating political violence would </p><p>take time. In the interim, Nigeria would continue to </p><p>build its democracy by keeping what is vital to its </p><p>culture, discarding what is harmful, and borrowing </p><p>what is good and relevant from the West, Obasanjo </p><p>maintained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) By campaigning on substantive issues and </p><p>letting people freely criticize him, Obasanjo hoped to </p><p>set a personal example in excising violence and </p><p>promoting tolerance. In this regard, Obasanjo said he </p><p>welcomed other contenders for the PDP presidential </p><p>nomination.  "The more the merrier," he asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Natsios mentioned that he and Secretary Powell </p><p>had successfully fought for, and President Bush had </p><p>approved, an unprecedented 25 percent increase in </p><p>regular development assistance to Africa  over and </p><p>above funding from the Millennium Challenge Account. </p><p>However, in Washington and throughout the Western </p><p>donor community, there was skepticism about whether </p><p>that money would be put to good use unless it were </p><p>allocated to countries with demonstrated good </p><p>performance.  Nigeria could diminish the negativism by </p><p>holding credible elections, Natsios said. Conversely </p><p>bad elections would diminish those who had advocated </p><p>increased assistance to Africa. Obasanjo acknowledged </p><p>the point by stating that he knew political violence </p><p>and the Shari\'a adultery stoning sentences had put </p><p>Nigeria in an ugly light. As the meeting concluded, </p><p>both Natsios and Jeter reiterated the importance of </p><p>Nigeria holding its first successful civilian-run </p><p>elections.  Obasanjo shook his head affirmatively, </p><p>vowing to do all in his powers to do just that -- to </p><p>conduct good elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>FOND MEMORIES OF AID </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Obasanjo expressed deep appreciation for </p><p>current USAID programs and assistance in Nigeria. He </p><p>also mentioned, with visible fondness, how USAID </p><p>assistance had helped construct the "first </p><p>comprehensive high school in Nigeria", located in </p><p>Obasanjo\'s home state, Ogun.  Down there, people see </p><p>USAID as America, he told Natsios. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The meeting was generally positive. Despite </p><p>the phalanx of officials and politicians waiting to </p><p>see him, Obasanjo was relaxed, engaging and generous </p><p>with his time. Administrator Natsios was able to make </p><p>our key points.  By endorsing the Code of Conduct and </p><p>pledging to fund INEC, Obasanjo took two of those </p><p>three key points on board. On the third major point, </p><p>his take on voter registration was disappointing; </p><p>Obasanjo appeared not to fully appreciate the public\'s </p><p>criticism of the exercise. However, remedying the gaps </p><p>in voter registration lies in INEC\'s exclusive purview </p><p>and its Chairman told Natsios that INEC would reopen </p><p>voter registration in December or January 2003 </p><p>(septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) While Obasanjo\'s statements were encouraging, </p><p>we also know that stifling violence will be easier </p><p>said than done. Obasanjo took the high road and seemed </p><p>overly optimistic. The much of the violence in Kaduna </p><p>that claimed hundreds of lives began the day of the </p><p>meeting and the riots in Abuja took place only two </p><p>days after. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) The Administrator cleared this message. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
