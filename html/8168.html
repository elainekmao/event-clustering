<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 002404 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  EXPAT SHI\'A DELIVER THANK-YOU FOR IRAQ LIBERATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  Two expat Iraqi Shi\'a professionals (both long resident in </p><p>the UAE) called on A/DCM May 19 to deliver a letter of thanks </p><p>from their community here for the liberation of Iraq.  84 self- </p><p>styled "Iraqi Shi\'a intellectuals" (mostly doctors and engineers) </p><p>signed a letter (text in para three) expressing their </p><p>appreciation for the ouster of Saddam and calling for the U.S. to </p><p>remain in Iraq as long as necessary to establish a democratic </p><p>government.  In presenting their letter/petition, the two doctors </p><p>(one an orthodontist, the other a psychiatrist) said they have </p><p>been deeply disturbed by television images of angry Iraqi Shi\'a </p><p>demonstrating against the U.S. presence, which they felt did not </p><p>represent the true feelings of the Iraqi Shi\'a community.  They </p><p>said that the expat Shi\'a community in the UAE strongly supports </p><p>a democratic government with a clear separation of mosque and </p><p>state -- which they argued would be the most appropriate form of </p><p>government for historically secular Iraq.  A/DCM thanked the two </p><p>Iraqi doctors for their letter and agreed to stay in touch </p><p>regarding matters of concern to their community. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>April 28, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Her Excellency the American Ambassador in the UAE </p><p> </p><p>Dear Ms. Ambassador </p><p> </p><p>We the Iraqi Shi\'a intellectuals in Abu Dhabi and the rest of the </p><p>Emirates wish to express our views regarding the current events </p><p>in our country. </p><p> </p><p>We begin by conveying our high appreciation through your </p><p>Excellency to the American administration and the American people </p><p>for having helped the Iraqi people to demolish the cruel and </p><p>corrupted regime of Saddam Hussein.  Further more, we think that </p><p>the continued support of coalition forces is crucial until the </p><p>establishment of a democratically elected permanent government. </p><p> </p><p>We highly respect the sacrifices made by the American and </p><p>coalition forces.  Were it not for their action, the criminal </p><p>regime would have continued to preside over Iraq for decades to </p><p>come destroying Iraqi society, its values and norms while robbing </p><p>the people of their country\'s wealth. </p><p> </p><p>In spite of our respect for the Shi\'a clergymen in Iraq, some of </p><p>them are not representing our views.  We are not in agreement </p><p>with their political opinions concerning the American government </p><p>and the future of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>We believe that after long years of suffering under tyranny and </p><p>dictatorship, Iraqis deserve a free democratic country reflecting </p><p>the entire Iraqi mosaic.  In this regard we seek your help in </p><p>preventing some countries, Arab and non-Arab alike, from </p><p>interfering with the process of building the future of Iraq and </p><p>its democracy. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you with best regards. </p><p> </p><p>Yours, </p><p> </p><p>The Undersigned </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
