<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002589 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/S LISA JACOBSON AND IO/EDA WINNICK AND KOTOK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR REICH AND HUGHES </p><p>ATHENS FOR CLEVERLEY </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, KUNR, ABUD, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT:  REPORT OF FAO PROGRAM COMMITTEE AND JOINT </p><p>FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  This cable reports on the outcomes of the </p><p>Joint Session of the UN Food and Agriculture </p><p>Organization\'s (FAO) Finance and Program Committees and </p><p>the FAO Program Committee.  Important outcomes from the </p><p>Program Committee include full support for the </p><p>International Plant Protection Business Plan "under any </p><p>funding scenario" and FAO Secretariat assurance that </p><p>FAO\'s "Food Chain" activities for the next biennium were </p><p>"not related" to the draft "Food Chain" strategy </p><p>submitted to the last Committee on Agriculture.  The </p><p>Program Committee will continue to discuss the question </p><p>of priority setting -- in principle and practice -- at </p><p>the next session in September.  The Joint Session also </p><p>briefly discussed the recently released JIU Report on </p><p>Administration and Management at the FAO. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>"Aren\'t we doing everything we were asked to do?" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>2.  The Joint Session of FAO\'s Program and Finance </p><p>Committee met May 7, 2003.  FAO Director General (DG) </p><p>Jacques Diouf opened the session with a plea for a real </p><p>growth budget for the next biennium, arguing that member </p><p>economies had grown, that member demands on the FAO had </p><p>increased, but that FAO continued to be the "hardest hit" </p><p>in the UN system by budget constraints.  DG Diouf noted, </p><p>in fact that staffing reductions in the Finance Division </p><p>had, in the view of the outgoing External Auditor, put </p><p>the organization at risk in terms of internal financial </p><p>management controls.  DG Diouf stated that members asked </p><p>for more activities, but did not prioritize activities. </p><p>He added that this was not the secretariat\'s job. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DG ran through a list of FAO accomplishments, </p><p>including FAO\'s food security strategies for various </p><p>regions, FAO\'s statistics work, the 33 million "hits" a </p><p>month received by FAO\'s web-site, FAO\'s role as a </p><p>platform for international negotiations, its role in </p><p>advocating rural development at the World Summit on </p><p>Sustainable Development in 2002 and it\'s "pro-active role </p><p>on GMO\'s."  Concerning GMO\'s, DG Diouf hastened to add </p><p>that work was also being done on "precautionary measures" </p><p>and "labeling."  Turning to FAO\'s Special Program for </p><p>Food Security (SPFS), DG Diouf noted that the program -- </p><p>launched at USD 35 million -- was now worth USD 500 </p><p>million and was a stellar example of south-south </p><p>cooperation, and country ownership (in many SPFS </p><p>projects, close to half of the costs are borne by the </p><p>host government).  In closing, the DG asked, "What\'s </p><p>missing?  Aren\'t we doing everything we were asked to do? </p><p>Do you want to help the 800 million hungry?  Give them </p><p>the tools to help themselves." </p><p> </p><p>Report of Program Committee -- some agreement on Standard </p><p>Setting... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>4.  The Chair of the Program Committee (Blair Hankey of </p><p>Canada) ran through the Program Committee\'s (PC) </p><p>discussion of the 2004-2005 Summary Program of Work and </p><p>Budget.  He noted that the conclusions of the technical </p><p>committees (e.g., the Committees on Agriculture, </p><p>Forestry, Fishery and Commodity Problems) had not yet </p><p>been reflected in the budget, but would be in the next </p><p>version. </p><p> </p><p>-- On priority setting in general, PC members agreed that </p><p>"methodological tools", such as application of criteria </p><p>and weighting methods could be useful; nonetheless, they </p><p>should not substitute for the "political process."  The </p><p>PC will continue to discuss improving the priority </p><p>setting process at its next session in September 2003. </p><p> </p><p>-- On the priorities for the SPWB for 2004-2005, G-77 </p><p>members felt that a real growth budget was the only way </p><p>to meet all of the needs; OECD members of the Committee </p><p>felt that areas of highest priority "should be adequately </p><p>resourced, irrespective of budget levels." </p><p> </p><p>-- The PC agreed that the "scope and funding of some </p><p>entities and PAIA\'s be adjusted in the full PWB, based on </p><p>guidance received from the last Committee on Agriculture, </p><p>including for work on Biotechnology, Biosecurity, Ethics, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>and Good Agricultural Practices."  In this regard, the PC </p><p>also noted that the entity on the Food Chain in the SPWB </p><p>was, according to the Secretariat, "not related to the </p><p>draft strategy document on a food chain approach to food </p><p>safety and quality discussed at COAG." </p><p> </p><p>-- While not identifying any activities to cut, the PC </p><p>did agree that the International Plant Protection (IPPC) </p><p>"Business Plan" should be funded under any budget </p><p>scenario. </p><p> </p><p>-- The PC also reaffirmed that the FAO should provide its </p><p>share of the additional resources required for the </p><p>recommendations of the joint FAO/WHO Evaluation of Codex </p><p>Alimentarius.  Furthermore, activities originally </p><p>programmed under the "Food Chain" program entity for 2004- </p><p>2005 (in the real growth scenario) could be cut and </p><p>corresponding savings reallocated to Codex and Codex </p><p>related work (Comment: This is a positive outcome, </p><p>however, those "savings" will only accrue if the FAO </p><p>Conference agrees to a real growth budget." End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-- The PC stressed the "desirability" of providing </p><p>increased resources for Fisheries and recommended that </p><p>the budget for Forestry be "restored to at least the same </p><p>level as in the current PWB 2002-2003. </p><p> </p><p>-- On FAO country representatives, the PC reiterated the </p><p>importance of appointing qualified FAO representatives </p><p>and of their performance appraisal. </p><p> </p><p>-- The PC requested that more information on FAO\'s </p><p>Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) be provided in the </p><p>SPWB.  Developing country members of the PC also argued </p><p>that FAO\'s Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) needed </p><p>more resources. </p><p> </p><p>-- The PC also agreed that there should be an HIV/AIDS </p><p>Priority Area of Inter-Disciplinary Action (PAIA).  The </p><p>Committee called for a review of the existing PAIA\'s at </p><p>some time in the next biennium. </p><p> </p><p>-- Concerning SPFS, while noting that developing </p><p>countries argued that the SPFS was "the most effective </p><p>international program bringing practical assistance to </p><p>farmers", the Chair noted that there were questions from </p><p>other members as to whether the program targeted the </p><p>poorest, and as to why there were no SPFS projects at </p><p>Phase II (i.e. self-sustainable). </p><p> </p><p>...but not at the expense of technical cooperation </p><p>programs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>5.  Taking the floor in response to the PC Chair\'s </p><p>presentation, PC member Malaysia agreed that developing </p><p>countries also sought results based programming, that </p><p>quality of programs was important, and that developing </p><p>countries very much wanted standard setting and capacity </p><p>building to implement those standard.  However, </p><p>increasing food production and food security was "a </p><p>priority" that came ahead of "food safety."  He stated </p><p>unequivocally that standard setting activities, however, </p><p>useful, must not be increased to the detriment of TCP or </p><p>SPFS. </p><p> </p><p>Report of the Finance Committee: no agreement on Split </p><p>Currency or Budget Level </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>6.  Finance Committee Chair Humberto Molina took the </p><p>floor briefly to state that the Finance Committee (FC) </p><p>had not come to any agreement on the budget level or on </p><p>the proposal for a split currency assessment. </p><p> </p><p>Joint Session of Program and Finance Committees: Members </p><p>present budget positions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>7. Members of the Finance Committees and Program </p><p>Committees took the floor to present general budget </p><p>positions.  The U.S., Japan and Australia supported zero </p><p>nominal growth (ZNG). USDel noted that FAO was years </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>behind in spending its current TCP allocation therefore </p><p>increasing the TCP allocation did not make sense; </p><p>furthermore, in an effort to assist in prioritizing, the </p><p>U.S. was one of the few countries that had consistently </p><p>suggested activities of low priority to be terminated. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Australia noted that the widely-supported activities </p><p>of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures were </p><p>not protected in the ZNG or Zero Real Growth (ZRG) </p><p>scenarios.  From this he could only conclude: "either the </p><p>Secretariat is unresponsive, or else members are being </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>held to ransom by the Secretariat over the budget issue." </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Netherlands, Switzerland and the Latin American </p><p>members of the Program Committee (Dominican Republic, </p><p>Paraguay) supported Zero Real Growth (ZRG).  Pakistan </p><p>stated (in response to the DG\'s presentation), "if the </p><p>FAO is going to link world hunger to its budget, then the </p><p>Program of Work and Budget should have those indicators." </p><p> </p><p>Independence and Location of the Evaluation Service </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>10. PC and FC members discussed the report -- a follow-up </p><p>to a recommendation of the External Auditor -- concerning </p><p>independence and location of the FAO\'s Evaluation </p><p>Service. Members generally did not support the suggestion </p><p>to merge the audit and evaluation function.  Developed </p><p>and developing countries did support, however, increasing </p><p>the independence of the Evaluation Unit.  Some members </p><p>recalled that at the International Fund for Agricultural </p><p>Development (IFAD) a similar process had taken place just </p><p>this year, and the Evaluation Unit now reported to the </p><p>Executive Board rather than to the President.  The next </p><p>Joint Session will discuss the proposal in further detail </p><p>based on an options paper to be prepared by the FAO </p><p>Secretariat. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>JIU Report on FAO Management and Administration </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Those members who spoke (U.S., Netherlands, </p><p>Switzerland) called attention to the important </p><p>recommendations of the JIU report and called for </p><p>implementation and monitoring of follow-up.  It was </p><p>agreed that certain items which came under the purview of </p><p>the Finance and Program Committees would be divided up by </p><p>those Committees for further consideration at the </p><p>September session.
