(C) SUMMARY: UNDP RESREP VICTOR ANGELO DEBRIEFED DONORS ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 1 ON THE UNDP TEAM\'S REPORT ON THE "LAND REFORM PROCESS </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE". THE RESREP OPENED THE MEETING BY STATING THAT THE </p><p>REPORT WAS A DRAFT, WORKING DOCUMENT, COMPLETED BY AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>MISSION, WHICH, THUS REFLECTS THE TEAM\'S VIEWS AND NOT THOSE OF </p><p>THE UN.  HE DESCRIBED A SERIES OF MEETINGS UNDP HAS BEEN </p><p>CONDUCTING WITH ALL CONCERNED STAKEHOLDERS OVER RECENT WEEKS.  HE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THESE MEETINGS AS "POSITIVE", AND AS A PART OF THE </p><p>SYG\'S ON-GOING MANDATE TO ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE THE RESUMPTION OF A </p><p>DIALOGUE ON THIS DIFFICULT SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE RESREP THEN PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S "FAST TRACK" PROGRAM TO DATE, FOLLOWED BY A </p><p>RUNDOWN OF THE AGRICULTURAL SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY.  HE THEN </p><p>INTRODUCED THE DRAFT TEAM REPORT, HIGHLIGHTING THE TEAM\'S </p><p>RESTRICTIVE MANDATE ON TECHNICAL ISSUES AND THE FAST TRACK </p><p>APPROACH.  THE TEAM\'S MAJOR FINDING IS THAT NO FAST TRACK PLAN </p><p>EXISTS, AND THAT ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN TO DATE ARE "AD HOC", AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTED ACCORDING TO THE INDIVIDUAL LOCAL PLAYERS AND </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES.  HE LISTED THE TEAM\'S ASSESSMENT OF THE MANY </p><p>SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS OF THE PROGRAM AS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED, </p><p>FOCUSSING PRIMARILY ON THE SEVERE CAPACITY AND RESOURCE </p><p>CONSTRAINTS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PROGRAM ASPECT. </p><p> </p><p>-- GROUP QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOCUSSED ON THE SERIOUS </p><p>LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON THE TEAM/REPORT BY THEIR OVERLY </p><p>RESTRICTIVE MANDATE, ESPECIALLY REGARDING GOVERNMENT\'S PROMINENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06282  01 OF 04  071612Z </p><p>ROLE IN THE PROGRAM (AS OPPOSED TO ALTERNATIVE, MORE MARKET- </p><p>ORIENTED, PARTICIPATORY AND DECENTRALIZED "COMPLEMENTARY" </p><p>APPROACHES TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION), AND THE FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>POLITICAL (RATHER THAN TECHNICAL) NATURE OF THE PROBLEM. </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD SUBMITTED STRONG COMMENTS THAT THE </p><p>RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW WAS CRITICAL.  HE ALSO STATED THAT </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND DONORS NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROCESS IS A </p><p>TWO-WAY STREET WITH DIALOGUE VERY IMPORTANT.  THE RESREP </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY WAY FORWARD WAS THROUGH A RESUMPTION OF </p><p>DIALOGUE BY ALL CONCERNED PARTIES, WHICH ALL PARTICIPANTS </p><p>STRONGLY ENDORSED.  TOWARDS THIS END, HE INDICATED UN PLANS TO </p><p>CONTINUE THIS INITIATIVE, BOTH IN ZIMBABWE AND NEW YORK, IN AN </p><p>EFFORT TO ACHIEVE A PRODUCTIVE INTERACTION.  DESPITE LOW </p><p>EXPECTATIONS FOR IMMEDIATE PROGRESS, ALL PRESENT WELCOMED THE </p><p>UN\'S EFFORTS IN THIS BEHALF.  THE RESREP REQUESTED A FOLLOW-UP </p><p>MEETING NEXT WEEK (THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9) WITH A SMALLER MORE </p><p>LIMITED GROUP OF SERIOUS POTENTIAL DONOR COUNTRIES TO FURTHER </p><p>DISCUSS THE TECHNICAL REPORT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, USAID DIRECTOR AND AID TECHNICAL </p><p>OFFICER ATTENDED A UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP) </p><p>MEETING ON NOVEMBER 1, CHAIRED BY THE NEW UNDP RESIDENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE (RESREP) TO ZIMBABWE, J. VICTOR ANGELO, TO REVIEW </p><p>THE EXPERT UNDP TEAM\'S REPORT ON THE "LAND REFORM PROCESS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE" THAT WAS COMPLETED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO FOLLOWING A THREE- </p><p>WEEK MISSION (SEE SEVERAL PRIOR REFTELS ON THIS UNDP INITIATIVE). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE UNDP RESREP OPENED THE MEETING BY STATING THAT THE </p><p>REPORT WAS A DRAFT WORKING DOCUMENT, COMPLETED BY AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>MISSION; AND THAT IT, THUS, REFLECTS THE VIEWS OF THE TEAM AND </p><p>NOT THOSE OF THE UN.  HE ALSO CAUTIONED THAT IT WAS AN UNEDITED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06282  01 OF 04  071612Z </p><p>VERSION, REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL WORK.  HE INDICATED </p><p>THAT, IN THE PRIMARY INTEREST OF PROMOTING THE RESUMPTION OF A </p><p>DIALOGUE ON THIS TOPIC, UN SECRETARY GENERAL (SYG) ANNAN </p><p>REQUESTED THAT THE REPORT BE DISCUSSED WITH CONCERNED ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS BEFORE IT WAS FINALIZED AND REVIEWED FORMALLY IN NEW </p><p>YORK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) TOWARDS THIS END, THE RESREP REPORTED THAT HE HAS BEEN </p><p>CONDUCTING A SERIES OF MEETINGS OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS WITH </p><p>CONCERNED ZIMBABWEAN STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING SENIOR GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE (GOZ) DECISION-MAKERS, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL MAJOR </p><p>FARMERS\' UNIONS AND VARIOUS OTHER DONOR AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>INTERESTS.  WHILE HE CHARACTERIZED THE RESULTS OF THESE MEETINGS </p><p>AS "POSITIVE", HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE PROTAGONISTS\' POSITIONS </p><p>REMAINED FAR APART AND THEY HAD NOT RESUMED ANY MEANINGFUL </p><p>DIALOGUE ON THIS CRITICAL SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE RESREP PROVIDED A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT </p><p>STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S ON-GOING "FAST TRACK </p><p>PROGRAM", BASED ON AVAILABLE GOZ INFORMATION TO DATE: </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8185 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06282  02 OF 04  071613Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------9BFE22  071613Z /38 </p><p>P 071612Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7578 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 006282 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>A/AID FOR R.

OF LAND, AND 162,000 PEOPLE RESETTLED OVER FOUR </p><p>YEARS ON FIVE MILLION HA. OF LAND).   COMMENT:  GIVEN THE CURRENT </p><p>STATE OF THE ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY, THE MISSION BELIEVES THESE </p><p>TARGETS ARE TOTALLY UNREALISTIC, AT LEAST OVER THE SHORT-TERM AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- GOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING SUBSIDIZED TILLAGE SERVICES (I.E., Z$ </p><p>4,207/HA.) TO THESE NEWLY RESETTLED FARMERS, WHICH THE SETTLERS </p><p>ARE SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR, IN AN EFFORT TO FACILITATE THEIR </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE IMMINENT PLANTING SEASON.  HOWEVER, ONLY </p><p>2,729 HA. HAS BEEN TILLED UNDER THIS PROGRAM TO DATE, DUE TO </p><p>INSUFFICIENT GOVERNMENT TRACTORS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE AND </p><p>THE INABILITY OF MANY OF THE SETTLERS TO PAY FOR EVEN THESE </p><p>MINIMAL SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>-- GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED Z$ 2.7 BILLION FOR RESETTLEMENT AND </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE IN ITS 2001 BUDGET (SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED </p><p>WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS). </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ONSET OF THE RAINS THE NOVEMBER 4-5 WEEKEND HAS ADDED AN </p><p>EXTRA URGENCY TO THE ENTIRE LAND REFORM PROCESS.  FOR GOVERNMENT, </p><p>THERE IS EXTRA PRESSURE TO GET MORE SETTLERS IN PLACE.  FOR </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS, THERE IS INCREASED PRESSURE </p><p>TO GET THIS SEASON\'S PLANTING PREPARATIONS COMPLETED.  AND, FOR </p><p>PROSPECTIVE SETTLERS, THERE IS INCREASED PRESSURE TO GET THEIR </p><p>PLOTS AND REQUIRED INPUTS IN TIME FOR THE PLANTING SEASON.  THE </p><p>RESULT HAS BEEN INCREASED OCCUPATIONS AND VIOLENCE ON THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS OVER THE PAST WEEKS, AS PEOPLE SCRAMBLE FOR LAND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06282  02 OF 04  071613Z </p><p>(WITH GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGEMENT AND ASSISTANCE) AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS ATTEMPT TO \'RESOLVE\' THE SITUATION SO </p><p>THEY CAN FINISH THEIR OWN SEASON\'S PREPARATIONS ON TIME.  CURRENT </p><p>"WORKING FIGURES" ARE THAT BETWEEN 1,500 AND 1,600 COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS ARE OCCUPIED THROUGHOUT ZIMBABWE BY 10,000 TO 15,000 </p><p>PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE RESREP ALSO REPORTED THAT TO DATE GENERAL </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PLANTINGS WERE DOWN AN ESTIMATED 15% NATIONWIDE, </p><p>WITH MAIZE PLANTINGS REDUCED BY 50 TO 65%, AND A FORECASTED 20% </p><p>DROP IN THIS SEASON\'S WHEAT HARVEST.  SIMILARLY, HORTICULTURAL </p><p>CROP EXPORTS AND TOURISM WERE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY.  FOR CATTLE, HE </p><p>NOTED THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF BEEF CURRENTLY ON </p><p>THE MARKET, WHICH POINTED TO DE-STOCKING, PRINCIPALLY WITHIN THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR.  ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, HE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE AREA PLANTED TO SOYBEANS AND COTTON HAD INCREASED </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 20% FROM FARMERS SWITCHING CROPS ACCORDING TO </p><p>MARKET SIGNALS.  COMMENT:  WHILE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THIS SEASON\'S </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, GIVEN ALL OF THE DISTRACTIONS AND </p><p>DELAYS, MORE TIME WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROPERLY ASSESS THIS </p><p>SEASON\'S ACTUAL PLANTINGS AND PRODUCTION IMPACT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) DURING A BRIEF QUESTION AND ANSWER (Q&A) SESSION </p><p>FOLLOWING THIS INTRODUCTION, THE RESREP NOTED THAT THE UN WAS NOT </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO MEDIATE OR NEGOTIATE ANYTHING; BUT, RATHER, THAT </p><p>THEIR MANDATE FROM THE SYG IS TO PROMOTE A DIALOGUE ON THIS </p><p>SUBJECT.  THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR NOTED HIS RHETORICAL CONCERN </p><p>REGARDING THE DISPLACED FARM WORKERS ("IS THERE REALLY ANY NET </p><p>GAIN THROUGH THIS PROGRAM?") </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06282  02 OF 04  071613Z </p><p>8.  (C) IN INTRODUCING THE UNDP TEAM\'S REPORT, THE RESREP NOTED </p><p>THAT IT WAS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ALLOWED </p><p>DISCUSSION OF THE 1998 DONOR CONFERENCE PRINCIPLES WITHIN THE </p><p>REPORT; AND, INDEED, THAT IT HAD PERMITTED THE MISSION/REPORT </p><p>ITSELF.  HE THEN RECOUNTED THE DRAFT REPORT\'S MAJOR FINDINGS AS </p><p>FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TEAM\'S MANDATE WAS LIMITED TO TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>ONLY; HENCE, THE REPORT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED FUNDAMENTAL POLITICAL ISSUES SURROUNDING THIS </p><p>SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THERE IS NO FAST TRACK LAND REFORM PLAN, AS SUCH, AT PRESENT </p><p>(ONLY A 10-PAGE DESCRIPTIVE DOCUMENT).  WHAT IS PRESENTLY </p><p>OCCURRING IS "AD HOC" AND HIGHLY VARIABLE WITHIN DIFFERENT </p><p>REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY, DEPENDING UPON THE SPECIFIC CAPACITIES </p><p>AND INCLINATIONS OF THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS AND THEIR STAFF. </p><p>THE RESREP CHARACTERIZED THE SITUATION TO DATE AS "AD HOCISM, </p><p>DEPENDING ON THE INSPIRATION OF THE MAIN PLAYERS." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TEAM TRIED TO REMAIN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE FAST </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8189 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06282  03 OF 04  071613Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------9BFE3A  071613Z /38 </p><p>P 071612Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7579 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 006282 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>A/AID FOR R.

END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE RESREP\'S CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY FORWARD IS </p><p>THROUGH CONSENSUS AND DIALOGUE.  THE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS TO DO </p><p>NOTHING, AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ALL.  COMMENT: THERE IS NO </p><p>DISAGREEMENT ON THIS POINT, EVEN IF EXPECTATIONS ARE LOW AT THIS </p><p>TIME.  IN FACT, THAT HAS BEEN THE AGREED DONOR STRATEGY ALL ALONG </p><p>-- KEEP TALKING -- EVEN IF NOT SUCCESSFUL, WHILE CONTINUING TO </p><p>PURSUE ALTERNATIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES (LOCAL </p><p>INITIATIVES) AND SCHEMES IF PERMITTED TO DO SO BY THE GOZ.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) A SERIES OF Q&AS FOLLOWED THIS PRESENTATION.  THE MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT THEME WAS "WE WELCOME DIALOGUE AND THE UN ROLE IN </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO FACILITATE THIS." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE EU REPRESENTATIVE BEST ARTICULATED THE CURRENT </p><p>GENERAL DONOR POSITIONS ON THIS SUBJECT: (1) THE TEAM\'S PREMISE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06282  03 OF 04  071613Z </p><p>OF RETAINING THE GOZ AS THE LEAD PLAYER IN LAND REFORM WAS </p><p>UNFORTUNATE, AS THERE ARE MANY OTHER "COMPLEMENTARY" MARKET- </p><p>ORIENTED, BOTTOM UP APPROACHES THAT WOULD RESULT IN MORE </p><p>EFFICIENT, EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT (AS </p><p>NOTED IN THE TEAM\'S REPORT REGARDING THE KAROI INITIATIVE); (2) </p><p>THAT THE TEAM\'S TECHNICAL MANDATE WAS ANOTHER "FATAL FLAW", AS WE </p><p>ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS IN 1998 </p><p>WHICH COULD READILY BE REVISED TO THE PRESENT CONTEXT. THE MOST </p><p>SERIOUS ISSUES ARE POLITICAL; AND, THEREFORE, BY AVOIDING THIS </p><p>ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM, THE TEAM\'S RECOMMENDATIONS WERE DOOMED TO </p><p>"MISS THE BOAT"; AND (3) THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY IS NOT </p><p>STATIC AND, BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING LAWLESSNESS, MANY DONOR </p><p>HEADQUARTERS ARE REVIEWING ENTIRE ASSISTANCE PACKAGE TO ZIMBABWE. </p><p>COMMENT:  THE RAPIDLY DETERIORATING ECONOMIC SITUATION FIGURES </p><p>PROMINENTLY IN THESE DELIBERATIONS AS WELL.  END COMMENT. </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF GERMANY, JAPAN AND CANADA ALSO OFFERED SIMILAR </p><p>COMMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD SUBMITTED PARTICULARLY STRONG </p><p>COMMENTS REGARDING THE NEED FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW AND ORDER, AND THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENT AND DONORS TO </p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE A TWO-WAY STREET WITH </p><p>DIALOGUE CRITICAL.  IN RESPONSE, THE RESREP ACKNOWLEDGED THESE </p><p>SERIOUS CONCERNS, AND REFERRED TO THE TEAM\'S RECOMMENDED LAND </p><p>REFORM TRUST FUND PROPOSAL, AS AN INDICATION OF GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO RE-ENGAGE DONORS ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM AS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY ACCOMPLISHED AT THE 1998 DONOR\'S CONFERENCE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE RESREP, ALL OF THE "PRINCIPLES" AGREED TO AT THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WERE NOW BACK ON THE TABLE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) THE MEETING CONCLUDED WITH A DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06282  03 OF 04  071613Z </p><p>THE TEAM\'S DRAFT REPORT AND THE RESREP\'S REQUEST TO MEET </p><p>THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9, WITH A SMALLER MORE LIMITED GROUP OF </p><p>SERIOUS POTENTIAL DONOR COUNTRIES, POSSIBLY RESTRICTED TO THE </p><p>DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION OR AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL, TO FURTHER </p><p>DISCUSS THE TECHNICAL REPORT (AS A MORE MANAGEABLE AND EFFECTIVE </p><p>SIZE GROUP FOR ON-GOING DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT). </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) POST IS REVIEWING THE TECHNICAL REPORT AND DISCUSSING IT </p><p>WITH OTHER KEY DONORS.  WE WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL COMMENTS </p><p>SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) COMMENT: ASIDE FROM THE UPDATED INFORMATION ON FAST </p><p>TRACK IMPLEMENTATION AND AGRICULTURE, IN GENERAL, THE BRIEFING </p><p>DID NOT REALLY BREAK MUCH NEW GROUND.  A SUBSEQUENT REVIEW OF THE </p><p>DRAFT REPORT SUPPORTS THE VARIOUS HIGHLIGHTS OUTLINED ABOVE (AND </p><p>IN PRIOR BRIEFINGS ON THIS SUBJECT - SEE REFTELS).  GIVEN THE </p><p>TEAM\'S RESTRICTED MANDATE, CENTERED ON TRYING TO FIX THE </p><p>UNFIXABLE (FAST TRACK PROGRAM), WE EXPECT THE REPORT ITSELF WILL </p><p>MEET WITH LITTLE, IF ANY, SUCCESS.  MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, </p><p>HOWEVER, WILL BE IF THE UNDP CAN USE THE REPORT/INITIATIVE TO </p><p>RESUSCITATE A MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOZ AND ALL KEY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8190 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06282  04 OF 04  071613Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------9BFE3C  071613Z /38 </p><p>P 071612Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7580 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 04 HARARE 006282 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>A/AID FOR R.
