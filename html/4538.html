<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008696 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, KWMN, KCRM, PHUM, TU, TIP IN TURKEY </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT MOVES ON TRAFFICKING-IN-PERSONS INITIATIVES </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch; reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  MFA Deputy DirGen for Consular Affairs </p><p>Topcuoglu told us 11/26 the GOT has established an </p><p>inter-agency task force to address trafficking-in-persons </p><p>(TIP) in Turkey.  The group\'s first priority is to establish </p><p>and adopt the GOT\'s National Action Plan on TIP.  The plan, </p><p>currently in its final drafting stage, takes a three-pronged </p><p>approach: finalize the legal framework for combating TIP and </p><p>its organizers, provide better assistance to victims in </p><p>Turkey, and implement training and awareness programs. </p><p>However, Topcuoglu warned current GOT internal procedures </p><p>continue to slow implementation of many programs.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>GOT Task Force and National TIP Action Plan </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Nov 26 MFA Deputy DirGen for Consular Affairs </p><p>Topcuoglu reviewed with us GOT progress on tackling TIP. </p><p>Composed of approximately 25 members, the GOT TIP task force </p><p>has met twice thus far and continues to meet every 15 days. </p><p>The group is chaired by the MFA Directorate General for </p><p>Consular Affairs and contains members from the Ministry of </p><p>Interior, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of </p><p>Health, Directorate of Status and Problems of Women, and </p><p>Child Protection Institution.  Smaller coordinating bodies </p><p>are found within the Ministry of Interior in order to </p><p>streamline MOI\'s response to TIP.  After determining the </p><p>scope of each agency\'s TIP authority, the task force drafted </p><p>an eleven-point National Action Plan which will become the </p><p>framework for the GOT\'s fight against TIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Pending finalization by the relevant ministries, the </p><p>National Action Plan seeks to first strengthen and finalize </p><p>the legal framework for TIP by amending its Labour Law and </p><p>Working Permission for Foreigners and its citizenship law. </p><p>Whether Turkey\'s current eyewitness protection law for </p><p>certain crimes is applicable to cases of human trafficking </p><p>needs to clarified.  Second, the National Action Plan </p><p>concentrates upon victim assistance.  Governors from the </p><p>eastern city of Igdir to the western city of Istanbul have </p><p>been tasked to identify existing buildings that could be used </p><p>for victim shelters.  Following the establishment of victim </p><p>shelters, a victim hotline would be established in 16 cities </p><p>determined to be high TIP destinations.  GOT has further </p><p>contacted NGOs to determine their potential role of </p><p>assistance to victims.  Lastly, GOT seeks to implement </p><p>comprehensive training and awareness programs aimed at the </p><p>judiciary and law enforcement agencies in order to emphasize </p><p>responsiveness to both victim assistance and prosecution of </p><p>TIP organizers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Topcuoglu cautioned the change in government has led </p><p>to delays in the ratification time of the Palermo Convention </p><p>on Trafficking which is required for the Turkish Ministry of </p><p>Finance to allocate funding for any potential GOT </p><p>initiatives.  She further added that statistics based upon </p><p>the trafficking law passed in August 2002 would not be </p><p>available until June 2003 at the earliest.  The Turkish </p><p>Ministry of Justice requires the courts to submit statistical </p><p>information (i.e., number of cases filed, how these were </p><p>reconciled) only twice a year.  We stressed the importance of </p><p>concrete actions and suggested NGOs may be able to help with </p><p>certain aspects of the National Action Plan.  Topcuoglu </p><p>stated the Task Force was exploring all possibilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Comment </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Embassy comment:  The creation of an inter-agency task </p><p>force is a strong step by the GOT to combat TIP.  The </p><p>ministerial-level personnel changes caused by the November 3 </p><p>GOT elections have caused the ratification of the Palermo </p><p>Convention and other legal changes to be delayed.  However, </p><p>working-level non-constitutional reforms, such as victim </p><p>identification and NGO coordination could be implemented </p><p>fairly quickly without bueracratic interference. End comment. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
