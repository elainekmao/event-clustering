(A) ANKARA 4666 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 4386 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Turkish authorities signed the Letter of </p><p>Intent (LOI) late July 25, paving the way for the IMF Board </p><p>to complete the 5th Review as early as August 1.  Agreement </p><p>on the LOI came after GOT officials agreed to seek </p><p>Parliamentary approval of revised motor vehicle tax </p><p>legislation this week.  Parliament is scheduled to consider </p><p>this legislation, along with the last pending bill on social </p><p>security institutions, on July 29.  Meanwhile, bank </p><p>regulatory authorities have uncovered what they believe is </p><p>systemic double-accounting at the Uzan-owned Imar Bank. </p><p>Experts are still poring through records, but say the bank\'s </p><p>deposit liabilities are several times greater than the $800 </p><p>million Imar Bank officially reported ($5 billion, per the </p><p>press).  Some portion of the larger amount consists of </p><p>fraudulent accounts or offshore accounts that were </p><p>transferred onshore during or after regulators took over the </p><p>bank, but authorities believe the GOT will have to assume </p><p>liability for significantly more than the $800 million </p><p>originally reported.  Bank regulators have referred the case </p><p>for criminal investigation, but are concerned that the </p><p>problems surrounding the takeover could undermine their </p><p>credibility and possibly affect public confidence in the </p><p>banking sector.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) IMF ResRep reported to us late July 25 that State </p><p>Minister Babacan and Central Bank Governor Serdengecti had </p><p>signed a Letter of Intent (LOI), paving the way for an IMF </p><p>Board review as early as August 1.  The signing took place </p><p>after a frantic, 24-hour effort to fill the budget hole </p><p>created by the Constitutional Court\'s July 24 annulment of a </p><p>motor vehicle surtax (ref A). According to ResRep and Finance </p><p>Ministry officials, GOT authorities agreed to resubmit the </p><p>motor vehicle surtax legislation, slightly revised to address </p><p>the court\'s concerns, to Parliament on July 28-29. </p><p>Parliament is expected to consider this legislation, along </p><p>with the last remaining social security bill to strengthen </p><p>the social security institutions, on July 29.  IMF and World </p><p>Bank officials also confirmed to us that the GOT had </p><p>consulted with them in preparing amendments to the Public </p><p>Procurement Law, and they were satisfied with the results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) </p><p>Vice President Ercan Turkan (strictly protect) told us July </p><p>28 that the BRSA\'s takeover of Imar Bank, owned by the </p><p>notorious Uzan family, had turned into a "huge mess." </p><p>Turkan confirmed earlier BRSA statements (ref B) that, unlike </p><p>in previous cases, regulators had decided to liquidate the </p><p>bank and take responsibility only for deposit liabilities. </p><p>According to official Imar Bank reports to the BRSA, those </p><p>deposit liabilities totaled $800 million.  However, the BRSA </p><p>has subsequently gained partial access to Imar Bank records </p><p>-- though only with great difficulty and after much delay -- </p><p>and has learned that deposit liabilities are significantly </p><p>higher. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Ercan explained that auditors and experts have </p><p>uncovered what they believe is systemic double-accounting </p><p>through which the bank appears to have hidden hundreds of </p><p>millions, if not billions, of dollars in deposits.  Initial </p><p>indications are that total deposit liabilities are in the </p><p>billions (Ercan did not confirm press reports that the amount </p><p>is $5 billion, but other BRSA officials have said total </p><p>liabilities are "several times greater" than the $800 million </p><p>officially reported).  Some amount of the difference appears </p><p>to consist of deposits that were legitimately made but not </p><p>reported to BRSA (or the Finance Ministry or Central Bank). </p><p>Another part appears to be fraudulent accounts and offshore </p><p>accounts transferred onshore just before, during, and </p><p>immediately after the bank\'s takeover.  Some of the hidden </p><p>accounts are old, while others appeared on July 3 (the date </p><p>of the management takeover) or even later.  BRSA auditors are </p><p>working day and night to go through the accounts to try to </p><p>separate and define them.  Ercan suggested that the BRSA </p><p>would have to take responsibility for the "legitimately-made" </p><p>deposits, or risk undermining public confidence in its </p><p>deposit guarantee, and agreed that the total amount of </p><p>liabilities the agency would have to take on could be "in the </p><p>billions of dollars" (though certainly less than the $5 </p><p>billion headline figure).  The BRSA will not cover fraudulent </p><p>accounts or offshore accounts transferred onshore. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Ercan said that the bank owners appear to be </p><p>guilty of fraud, tax evasion, and violation of banking laws </p><p>as well as Central Bank regulations (governing reserve </p><p>requirements).  BRSA has already frozen the Uzan\'s assets in </p><p>Turkey, while also referring the case to the police and </p><p>Interior Ministry for possible criminal prosecution.  Bank </p><p>regulators will also try to liquidate the bank\'s assets, </p><p>which consist mostly of lending to the Uzan Group companies. </p><p>Given that this appears to have been a "well organized crime" </p><p>and that the Uzan Group has top-notch lawyers, BRSA is </p><p>seeking the help of Interior Ministry and other government </p><p>legal experts to go after the assets.  Ercan acknowledged, </p><p>however, that this will be a long process.  Regulators also </p><p>have seized management control of Adabank, the Uzan family\'s </p><p>second, smaller bank.  (Note:  The Uzan\'s had hoped to cement </p><p>their purchase of state-owned Petkim via a letter of credit </p><p>from Adabank, which now seems unlikely, to say the least. </p><p>End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The BRSA\'s immediate concern, in addition to </p><p>determining the precise amount of deposit liabilities it </p><p>needs to cover, is to ensure the problems surrounding the </p><p>handling of Imar Bank do not undermine public confidence in </p><p>the agency or the banking system.  Ercan said that the Uzans </p><p>are arguing publicly that the BRSA, together with independent </p><p>auditors, had conducted a three-stage audit of Imar Bank in </p><p>2002 and pronounced it solvent and healthy (after a $340 </p><p>million capital injection from the Group).  Moreover, they </p><p>say, the Bank has regularly reported its desposit liabilities </p><p>to the BRSA, so how can it now say it is surprised by the </p><p>amount?  Ercan admitted there is a problem, as the BRSA did </p><p>pronounce Imar Bank fit in 2002.  The explanation, he said, </p><p>is that -- to find this kind of intentional, well organized </p><p>fraud -- BRSA auditors would have to have had on-site access </p><p>to all of Imar Bank\'s 169 branches.  However, with only 80 </p><p>auditors on its staff, there was no way it could do this. </p><p>Ercan added that the Uzan\'s second claim -- that they have </p><p>reported the full amount of Imar Bank deposits to BRSA all </p><p>along -- is a flat-out lie.  Still, if depositors begin to </p><p>question the BRSA\'s competence or honesty, or to wonder what </p><p>other hidden problems plague the banking system, there could </p><p>be a decline in confidence and possibly even a run on some </p><p>small banks.  Ercan hastened to add that, so far, BRSA has </p><p>seen no evidence of such a bank run. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) IMF ResRep told us late today that he would meet </p><p>with BRSA staff July 29 to discuss the Imar Bank case and </p><p>next steps.  He noted that, at this point, no one knows how </p><p>much of the hidden deposits actually will end up in the </p><p>government\'s hands.  Whatever the size of the problem, Fund </p><p>staff will advise BRSA to transfer legitimate Imar Bank </p><p>deposits to another, sound bank, and to have Treasury issue </p><p>bonds to the bank equal to the new liabilities.  Such an </p><p>approach minimizes the fiscal and monetary impact of the </p><p>problem, though it does add to the Treasury\'s net liabilities </p><p>and budgetary expenditures, in the form of increased interest </p><p>payments.  He agreed that the question of how the BRSA\'s </p><p>three-stage audit process in 2002 could have missed this </p><p>enormous financial hole is extremely serious, and one the </p><p>Fund will certainly take up.  He does not, however, expect </p><p>this issue to delay the 5th Review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
