BUSH OF THE UNITED </p><p>   STATES LINKED AID TO GOOD GOVERNANCE.  CLEARLY, </p><p>   WORLD POVERTY HAS TO BE TACKLED WITH THE FULL </p><p>   KNOWLEDGE THAT UNLESS A COUNTRY GOVERNS ITS PEOPLE </p><p>   WITH FAIRNESS, IT CANNOT EXPECT TO ATTRACT MUCH </p><p>   HELP TO REDUCE POVERTY.  LIKE ANY OTHER AFRICAN </p><p>   COUNTRIES, ZIMBABWE HAS NOT ALWAYS BEHAVED </p><p>   RESPONSIBLY WITH OTHER PEOPLE\'S MONEY, PARTICULARLY </p><p>   FOR POVERTY ALLEVIATION.  THE CONDUCT OF THE </p><p>   PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAS BEEN SO OVERWHELMINGLY </p><p>   CONDEMNED AS A TRAVESTY OF FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE </p><p>   THAT THE FEW FRIENDS WHO HAD STUCK WITH US AFTER </p><p>   THE KILLINGS OF THE 2000 ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE </p><p>   DECIDED THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH.  ON ITS PRESENT </p><p>   RECORD OF VIOLENCE AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE, THE </p><p>   GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE IS UNLIKELY TO FIND </p><p>   TOO MANY COUNTRIES WILLING TO HELP IT END POVERTY </p><p>   AMONG ITS PEOPLE.  AS LONG AS THE KILLINGS </p><p>   CONTINUE, NO CONFERENCE ON POVERTY IS LIKELY TO </p><p>   HELP A REGIME SO COMMITTED TO VIOLENCE." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00767  01 OF 02  251337Z </p><p>3.

WE </p><p>   DEMAND THAT THE BRITISH AND THEIR RACIST FRIENDS </p><p>   ABANDON THE BLACKMAIL THEY ARE TRYING TO APPLY ON </p><p>   ZIMBABWE BECAUSE IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND </p><p>   RESOURCES.

THE ONLY CRIME TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>   COMMITTED BY VICTIMS OF THE CURRENT \'CARAVAN\' OF </p><p>   TERROR IS THAT THEY ARE SUSPECTED OF BEING MEMBERS </p><p>   OF THE OPPOSITION MDC, LEGAL OPPOSITION PARTY.  IT </p><p>   IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE UNITY WHEN COERCION IS </p><p>   EMPLOYED INSTEAD OF PERSUASION.  IT IS </p><p>   CONTRADICTORY TO RECOGNIZE THE DIVERSITY OF </p><p>   OPINIONS AND YET AT THE SAME TIME SEEK TO DENY OR </p><p>   PUNISH ANYONE HOLDING VIEWS CONTRARY TO ONE\'S OWN. </p><p>   IF MUGABE WAS SINCERE IN HIS CALL FOR UNITY, AND IF </p><p>   HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE ENJOYED THE CONFIDENCE AND </p><p>   SUPPORT IF THE 56,2 PERCENT OF THE 2,9 MILLION </p><p>   VOTERS IN THE COUNTRY WHO TOOK PART IN THE </p><p>   ELECTION, THEN HE WOULD HAVE STARTED BY DISMANTLING </p><p>   THE (TORTURE CAMPS) SET UP BY ZANU PF YOUTH </p><p>   BRIGADES.  HE WOULD ALSO HAVE ORDERED THE POLICE TO </p><p>   CLAMP DOWN ON THOSE RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY </p><p>   CAUSING MAYHEM AND BEHAVING AS IF THEY ARE ABOVE </p><p>   THE LAW.  HE WOULD HAVE ORDERED THE SECURITY AGENTS </p><p>   TO ENSURE ALL ACTS OF LAWLESSNESS AND THE FARM </p><p>   INVASIONS STOPPED FORTHWITH.  BUT THERE IS A FAR </p><p>   MORE SINISTER INFERENCE THAT CAN BE MADE HERE.  IT </p><p>   IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DARING THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>   COMMUNITY TO OSTRACIZE IT SO THAT IT BECOMES FREE </p><p>   OF ANY INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION TO UPHOLD HUMAN </p><p>   RIGHTS AND OTHER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS THAT GO </p><p>   WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE WORLD </p><p>   COMMUNITY.  INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION WOULD CREATE </p><p>   THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR DECLARING A STATE OF </p><p>   EMERGENCY AND THE GOVERNMENT WOULD THEN BE FREE TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00767  02 OF 02  251337Z </p><p>   TERRORIZE AND SUBJUGATE ITS OWN PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>6.   UNDER HEADLINE "THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE," THE </p><p>   INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE ZIMBABWE MIRROR" (03/22) </p><p>   COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>   ".IT IS CRUCIAL FOR PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT IN </p><p>   ZIMBABWE THAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND HIS FOLLOWERS </p><p>   INDULGE IN A CAREFUL AND HONEST ASSESSMENT OF BOTH </p><p>   THE BALANCE OF FORCES AND THE MOOD OF THE MASS OF </p><p>   THE PEOPLE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>   ELECTION.

AS PRESIDENTS MBEKI AND OBASANJO </p><p>   INTIMATED EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE MDC AND ZANU PF </p><p>   SHOULD PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES AND ENGAGE IN </p><p>   DIALOGUE.
