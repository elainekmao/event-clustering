<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ADANA 0046 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>FEBRUARY 18, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for February 18, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  KANADOGLU:  ERDOGAN CANNOT RUN IN SIIRT </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p>(All papers)  Sabih Kanadoglu, Chief Prosecutor </p><p>of the Supreme Court of Appeals, stressed that, </p><p>under Article 16 of the Member of Parliament </p><p>Election Law, AK Party leader Recep Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan cannot nominate himself in the March 9 </p><p>Siirt elections.  Kanadoglu noted the March 9 </p><p>elections were a continuation of the November 3 </p><p>Parliamentary elections.  Kanadoglu did not </p><p>object to Erdogan\'s nomination because the Higher </p><p>Election Council (YSK) had authority to </p><p>investigate the matter out of its own accord. </p><p>Tercuman reported that ballots would be published </p><p>in the Official Gazette on February 26.  Sabah </p><p>newspaper said the Republican People\'s Party </p><p>(CHP) Leader, Deniz Baykal, had viewed Siirt in </p><p>his "On the Anatolian Roads" article:  "We </p><p>proceeded from Anamur (Mersin) to Antalya and met </p><p>with Baykal there.  He was listening to the </p><p>public.  In answer to a question, he said CHP </p><p>would not cooperate with HADEP in Siirt.  "I will </p><p>not involved in an initiative that will block </p><p>Erdogan," he indicated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  ANTI-WAR PROTESTS </p><p>Milli Gazete reported continued criticism of a </p><p>possible U.S. operation against Iraq.  According </p><p>to the paper, anti-war protests were held in the </p><p>Southeastern provinces of Van and Adana, as well </p><p>as in Izmir and Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  EXPANSION AND RENEWAL PROJECTS </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  Repair and renewal projects </p><p>continued after the U.S. received construction </p><p>permission for nine bases and three ports, as </p><p>well as railways connections to these bases and </p><p>ports.  These bases and ports are mostly in the </p><p>Southern and Southeastern regions.  A project to </p><p>expand the runway of the Incirlik (Adana) Air </p><p>Base, which is likely to be used as a central </p><p>base during a possible war in Iraq, has been </p><p>expedited.  There has also been an increase in </p><p>the number of planes of various tonnages taking </p><p>off from and landing at Incirlik.  Patriot and </p><p>other missile ramps, as well as anti-aircraft </p><p>weapons will be placed around the base and its </p><p>runway.  Tercuman reported that a delegation of </p><p>U.S. experts surveyed the Mersin and Iskenderun </p><p>(Hatay) Ports. Activities have increased in </p><p>Mersin Port\'s wharves allocated to NATO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  GROUND EXERCISES IN INCIRLIK </p><p>Hurriyet reported the February 17 arrival of five </p><p>C-17 and a civilian cargo plane at the Incirlik </p><p>Air Base, which was repaired and painted during </p><p>the (Sacrifice) Holiday.  Another AWACS plane </p><p>joined two early warning planes giving support to </p><p>warplanes engaged in Operation Northern Watch. </p><p>Also, a command plane landed at Incirlik at noon. </p><p>Bolge reported that, after an hour of ground </p><p>exercise, warplanes took off from Incirlik to </p><p>carry out flights in northern Iraq.  While </p><p>preparations continue due to a possible operation </p><p>against Iraq, two military cargo planes landed at </p><p>the Adana Airport on February 17.  Material </p><p>unloaded from the planes was reportedly taken to </p><p>the Incirlik Air Base, as well as to Mersin\'s </p><p>Seka and Tasucu Ports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  U.S.\' B PLAN </p><p>(Turkiye)  The U.S. will implement plan B without </p><p>Turkey if the Turkish parliament fails to pass a </p><p>memorandum enabling the deployment of U.S. </p><p>soldiers in Turkey.  According to the plan, a </p><p>fleet carrying the Fourth Division of the U.S. </p><p>Navy will pass through the Suez Canal and </p><p>position in the Persian Gulf.  The Bermani, Beni </p><p>Harr and Suleymaniye airports in northern Iraq </p><p>will be renewed and Patriot missiles will be </p><p>deployed there.  In addition, U.S. soldiers, </p><p>including those at Incirlik Air Base, will be </p><p>flown to these airports.  These soldiers will </p><p>assume the responsibility of protecting oil wells </p><p>in Musul and Kirkuk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  U.S. SOLDIERS IN DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Dunya/Milliyet/Evrensel)  2000 U.S. soldiers </p><p>arrived in Diyarbakir to modernize bases to be </p><p>used in the event of a possible U.S. operation </p><p>against Iraq.  U.S. soldiers reportedly wanted to </p><p>stay in luxurious hotels in the province, but </p><p>their requests were not accepted due to possible </p><p>activities by the terror organization KADEK/PKK. </p><p>Instead, comfortable tents were set up for the </p><p>American soldiers at the Diyarbakir base. </p><p>Preparations are also underway for a 370-person </p><p>military delegation from the Netherlands.  C-130 </p><p>cargo planes affiliated with the U.S. Air Force </p><p>continue to transfer soldiers and ammunition, </p><p>while U.S. experts will expand the base\'s current </p><p>runway and construct a second one.  Radikal </p><p>reported the February 17 landing at Diyarbakir\'s </p><p>Second Tactic Air Base of two cargo planes </p><p>affiliated with the U.S. Air Force, reportedly </p><p>carrying U.S. soldiers and equipment from </p><p>Incirlik. Americans reportedly installed a </p><p>special radar system in Diyarbakir to guide and </p><p>monitor planes, as well as simultaneously </p><p>evaluate satellite photographs taken during an </p><p>operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  IRAQ SUMMIT AT HABUR BORDER GATE </p><p>(Turkiye/Dunya/Tercuman/Evrensel)  Members of the </p><p>Turkish national intelligence agency (MIT), </p><p>Turkish and U.S. generals, and northern Iraqi </p><p>Kurdish leaders met in Habur (Sirnak) on February </p><p>17 to discuss measures to be taken prior to a </p><p>possible war.  PUK leader Jalal Talabani, </p><p>Nechirvan Barzani of the KDP, Turkomen Front </p><p>President Ahmet Aga, as well as Turkish and </p><p>American generals, Turkish General Staff Special </p><p>Forces Deputy Commander Brigadier General </p><p>Abdullah Kilicarslan, representatives from MIT </p><p>and MFA, attended the meeting. Turkish officials </p><p>indicated that the PKK had gained strength during </p><p>the 1991 Gulf War, but would not allow such a </p><p>vacuum this time.  Kurdish leaders, who are </p><p>against the presence of Turkish soldiers in the </p><p>region, were asked to give up their demands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  CONTINUED DISPATCH OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND </p><p>SOLDIERS </p><p>(Dunya)  The dispatch of military vehicles and </p><p>equipment from various parts of Turkey to the </p><p>Iraqi border continues.  A convoy of 20 military </p><p>vehicles and personnel left Diyarbakir for Silopi </p><p>(Sirnak).  On February 17, a Turkish Naval ship </p><p>carrying military vehicles and soldiers anchored </p><p>at the Mersin Port.  The ship will reportedly </p><p>provide security for the U.S. Navy affiliated war </p><p>ships that may come to the port. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  FORCE COMMANDERS WILL TRAVEL TO THE </p><p>SOUTHEAST </p><p>(Turkiye/Radikal)  Chief of General Staff Hilmi </p><p>Ozkok, together with the four force commanders, </p><p>will travel to the Southeast on February 19 to </p><p>inspect bases and units along the (Iraqi) border. </p><p>They will also visit Diyarbakir\'s Second Army </p><p>Command, and bases at Batman and Incirlik. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. TURKISH MP\'S INSPECT SE PRISONS </p><p>(Milliyet)  The Turkish Parliamentary Human </p><p>Rights Commission did not detect torture during </p><p>its tour of the Southeast this season, and </p><p>announced "having found prisons better than </p><p>anticipated."  Turkish parliamentarians did point </p><p>to the continuation of prison conditions that </p><p>threatened inmates\' health, such as humidity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  PRO-OCALAN PROTESTS TURN VIOLENT </p><p>(Evrensel)  Many demonstrators were arrested on </p><p>February 17, while protesting the continued </p><p>isolation of jailed PKK leader Abdulla Ocalan. </p><p>Police intervened to disperse a group of people </p><p>who wanted to issue a press release in Mardin\'s </p><p>Kiziltepe district.  In Adana\'s Seyhan district, </p><p>police fired five shots into the air and beat a </p><p>youth they arrested.  A hunger strike in support </p><p>of Ocalan at the Seyhan chapter of DEHAP ended </p><p>(peacefully). 15 people were arrested in Adana\'s </p><p>Ceyhan district over the past two days.  Five </p><p>pro-Ocalan demonstrators were arrested in Batman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  NEW GOVERNORS TAKE OFFICE </p><p>(All papers)  Gaziantep Mayor Celal Dogan, </p><p>together with local officials, met the new </p><p>Gaziantep Governor, Lutfullah Bilgin.  Atilla </p><p>Osman Celebioglu, who had been appointed the new </p><p>Mersin Governor, took office on February 17. </p><p>Oguz Kagan Koksal, who had served as the Adana </p><p>Governor for the past seven years, left for </p><p>Bursa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  DIS PAYMENTS RESUME </p><p>(Dunya/Milli Gazete/Bolge)  In Sanliurfa, Direct </p><p>Income Support (DIS) payments resumed after the </p><p>February 11-14 Sacrifice Holiday.  The Sanliurfa </p><p>Agricultural Bank Director said his bank would </p><p>pay another TL 18 trillion (approx. USD 11 </p><p>million) in DIS to nearly 20,000 farmers.  Bolge </p><p>quoted the Adana Agricultural Engineers\' Chamber </p><p>President as complaining the DIS project had </p><p>diverted from its goal because agricultural </p><p>fields for which producers will receive DIS </p><p>payments had been limited to 125 acres. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
