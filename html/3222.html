<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001653 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PINS, SOCI, VM, RELFREE, DPOL, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT:  RESEARCHING RELIGION AT THE PARTY SCHOOL </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HANOI 156 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  A SEVEN YEAR-OLD CENTER AT THE MAIN PARTY </p><p>SCHOOL FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN VIETNAMESE HISTORY </p><p>AND PRESENT, AND HELPS TO EDUCATE UP-AND-COMING PARTY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01653  01 OF 02  011003Z </p><p>MEMBERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ABOUT THE "POSITIVE" ROLE </p><p>RELIGION CAN PLAY IN VIETNAM\'S DEVELOPMENT.  ITS OFFICIALS </p><p>HAVE PROMISED LATER THIS SUMMER TO PROVIDE DETAILED FEEDBACK </p><p>ON THE VIETNAM CHAPTER OF THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM REPORT. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  LIKE ITS COUNTERPART TO ANALYZE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>(REFTEL), THE "CENTER FOR SCIENCE OF BELIEF AND RELIGION" </p><p>("TRUNG TAM KHOA HOC VE TIN NGUONG VA TON GIAO," SOMETIMES </p><p>TRANSLATED IN OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AS THE CENTER FOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>STUDIES) OF THE HO CHI MINH NATIONAL POLITICAL ACADEMY </p><p>DEMONSTRATES THE RECOGNITION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF </p><p>VIETNAM (CPV) THAT IT MUST FACE SENSITIVE ISSUES HEAD ON AND </p><p>MUST ALSO TRAIN ITS "BEST AND BRIGHTEST" IN HOW TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>OFFICIAL POLICY.  POL/C MET ON JUNE 28 WITH THE CENTER\'S </p><p>DIRECTOR, DR. NGUYEN DUC LU, IN THE EMBASSY\'S FIRST CONTACT </p><p>WITH THIS CENTER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ACCORDING TO DR. LU, THE ACADEMY ESTABLISHED THE </p><p>CENTER IN 1995, AND TASKED IT WITH UNDERTAKING BOTH RESEARCH </p><p>AND TRAINING.  THE CENTER\'S FOURTEEN RESEARCH STAFFERS </p><p>CURRENTLY INCLUDE EIGHT WITH DOCTORATES.  NONE OF THEM IS A </p><p>PRACTITIONER OF ANY MAJOR RELIGION, DR. LU ADMITTED, WHILE </p><p>STRESSING THAT SOME OF THEM, LIKE MOST VIETNAMESE, HAVE </p><p>"BELIEF" SYSTEMS SUCH AS ANCESTOR WORSHIP (WHICH HE STRESSED </p><p>WAS NOT SUPERSTITIOUS).  DR. LU CLAIMED THAT CPV POLICY DID </p><p>NOT AT ALL PROHIBIT PARTY MEMBERS FROM BEING RELIGIOUS, BUT </p><p>AGREED THAT RELIGIOUS CPV MEMBERS WERE "VERY FEW." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  DR. LU NOTED THAT CPV POLICY TOWARD RELIGION HAD </p><p>BECOME MUCH MORE FAVORABLE IN 1990 WITH THE ISSUANCE OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01653  01 OF 02  011003Z </p><p>RESOLUTION 24, WHICH NOTED THAT RELIGION WAS A "LONG- </p><p>STANDING PROBLEM" IN VIETNAM, ASSESSED THAT RELIGION COULD </p><p>BE A "POSITIVE FORCE" IN BUILDING A "NEW SOCIETY,"  AND </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT RELIGION WAS A "SPIRITUAL NEED" OF SOME </p><p>VIETNAMESE CITIZENS.  SINCE THAT TIME, CPV POLICY HAS BEEN </p><p>TO "RESPECT" RELIGION AND TO UNDERTAKE APPROPRIATE </p><p>"MEASURES" TO ENSURE THAT RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS HAD THE </p><p>NECESSARY FREEDOM TO WORSHIP.  DR. LU STRESSED THAT THE </p><p>CPV\'S POSITION WAS THAT --  "IF HANDLED WELL" -- RELIGION </p><p>COULD BE GOOD FOR SOCIETY AND THE NATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  DR. LU CONFIRMED REPORTS THAT THE CPV WAS TINKERING </p><p>WITH ITS POLICY ON RELIGION, BUT DECLINED TO PROVIDE ANY </p><p>DETAILS.  HE ADMITTED ONLY THAT THE UPDATED POLICY, WHICH </p><p>WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO NEW REGULATIONS RATHER THAN A NEW LAW, </p><p>WOULD BE "BETTER" AND "MORE CORRECT" THAN EXISTING </p><p>LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  WHILE NOT OFFERING TO SHARE COPIES OF ANY RECENT </p><p>RESEARCH, DR. LU RELUCTANTLY DESCRIBED SOME RECENT TOPICS: </p><p>--  HO CHI MINH\'S VIEWS ON RELIGION (GENERALLY FAVORABLE, </p><p>DR. LU SAID); </p><p>--  COMPARATIVE BUDDHISM (I.E., BETWEEN VIETNAM AND OTHER </p><p>NATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA); </p><p>--  PRACTICES OF ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN VIETNAM; </p><p>--  THE NEXUS BETWEEN BUDDHISM AND CULTURE IN VIETNAMESE </p><p>HISTORY (HE NOTED THAT THIS LINK WAS NOWADAYS NOT VERY </p><p>STRONG); </p><p>--  ORGANIZATION AND PRECEPTS OF THE SIX MAJOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>GROUPS IN VIETNAM; </p><p>--  MARXIST/LENINIST ASSESSMENTS OF THE ROLE OF RELIGION; </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01653  01 OF 02  011003Z </p><p>--  THE "HUMANITARIAN VALUE" OF RELIGION; </p><p>--  RELIGIOUS PRACTICES OF ETHNIC MINORITIES (DR. LU </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE DONE SO FAR ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE, CLAIMING THAT SUCH RESEARCH WAS "DIFFICULT"). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  MOST OF THE TRAINING GIVEN BY THE CENTER FOR </p><p>STUDENTS (MID- TO SENIOR-LEVEL PARTY AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS) WAS "PRETTY BASIC," DR. LU SAID.  STAFF FROM THE </p><p>CENTER USUALLY ONLY LECTURED AS PART OF OTHER, BROADER </p><p>COURSES, RATHER THAN OFFERING SPECIALIZED COURSES OF STUDY. </p><p>THEIR FOCUS IS ON EXPLAINING THE HISTORY OF CPV VIEWS ON </p><p>RELIGION AND THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION OF RELIGIOUS POLICY. </p><p>HE ADMITTED THAT IT WAS "VERY NECESSARY" FOR ALL CADRES TO </p><p>HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE "PROBLEM" OF RELIGION, </p><p>AND THAT MANY DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT CPV POLICY.  (ONE </p><p>BUDDHIST MONK AFFILIATED WITH THE CENTRAL BUDDHIST SANGHA IN </p><p>HANOI PREVIOUSLY NOTED TO POL/C THAT HE IS OCCASIONALLY </p><p>INVITED TO SPEAK TO STUDENTS AT THE ACADEMY ON THE HISTORY </p><p>AND ROLE OF BUDDHISM IN VIETNAM; EMBASSY IS NOT CERTAIN IF </p><p>OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS ALSO LECTURE OCCASIONALLY.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE AND HIS STAFF HAD EVER READ </p><p>THE STATE DEPARTMENT\'S REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM, DR. LU PULLED OUT A WELL MARKED-UP COPY IN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4050 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01653  02 OF 02  011003Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   PRS-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------C4BF13  011004Z /38 </p><p>R 010946Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6892 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 001653 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>VIETNAMESE.
