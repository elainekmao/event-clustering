<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000261 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS AID/ANE, HHS FOR OGHA - STEIGER </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND IO/IHA </p><p>PHNOM PENH FOR AID - CAROL JENKINS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, SOCI, ECON, BM, NGO </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW HEALTH MINISTER PROGRESSIVE ON VCT </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request for EAP/BCLTV.  Please see </p><p>paragraph 7. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary:  The COM had a productive courtesy call on </p><p>the new Health Minister, pressing him on expanded VCT, </p><p>discussing an expected private health care law, and </p><p>presenting the case for visits to Burma by Orbis and </p><p>Operation Smile.  The Minister said he looked forward to </p><p>future U.S.-Burma dialogue on VCT and humanitarian aid </p><p>issues, and that he would try to be available when the USG </p><p>delegation led by OES DAS Chow comes to Rangoon at the end of </p><p>March.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Voluntary Counseling and Testing Progress Possible </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Chief of Mission paid a courtesy call on the new </p><p>Health Minister, Dr. Kyaw Myint, on February 26.   From the </p><p>outset of the meeting, it was clear the new Minister has </p><p>taken a far more positive position on INGO participation in </p><p>voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), than had his </p><p>predecessor.  Responding to the COM\'s questions, the Minister </p><p>said that the GOB would be willing to allow INGOs to provide </p><p>VCT services for at-risk communities (including TB patients). </p><p> However, he agreed that, the devil was in the details.  He </p><p>would not elaborate on what the outstanding details were, or </p><p>how the GOB currently stood on them, but he did urge the U.S. </p><p>government to send out someone to work out these details with </p><p>the Ministry.  Along these lines, the Minister was curious </p><p>why the CDC visit had been canceled, and said he looked </p><p>forward to its return. </p><p> </p><p>Private Healthcare Soon to Be Legalized </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) When asked about the status of a long-awaited law </p><p>legalizing private health care, the Minister turned to his </p><p>deputies to respond.  They were evasive, saying only that the </p><p>draft was in with the Attorney General\'s office, and that </p><p>when it emerged it should be ready for promulgation.  The law </p><p>will allow provision of health care by properly licensed and </p><p>supervised private clinics and pharmacies (currently private </p><p>clinics operate without official sanction).  The Minister\'s </p><p>staff was vague on the matter of foreign participation in the </p><p>new private health care sector.  However, the message seemed </p><p>clear that foreigners would not be allowed to participate </p><p>unless they were physicians licensed by the Myanmar Medical </p><p>Association. </p><p> </p><p>Orbis, Operation Smile Welcome </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The COM queried the Minister on the possibility of </p><p>U.S.-based non-profits Orbis and Operation Smile coming to </p><p>Burma.  The Minister replied that Orbis was "an old friend" </p><p>and could come anytime (Note: Orbis was in Burma most </p><p>recently in 2000).   He mentioned that there was already </p><p>significant international assistance for cleft palate and </p><p>facial reconstructive surgery, and that local doctors were </p><p>also performing these operations for the poorest children. </p><p>However, he said that Operation Smile should come to discuss </p><p>with the MOH a possible visit to Burma.  The COM gave the </p><p>Minister some background information on Operation Smile and </p><p>Orbis and told him we would advise these organizations of his </p><p>response. </p><p> </p><p>Looking for Help </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Minister volunteered the fact that Burma and the </p><p>GOB desperately need additional international assistance and </p><p>funding to effectively tackle the country\'s health-related </p><p>priorities.  He said the small amount of such funding and </p><p>advice to date have been major obstacles to success.  The </p><p>Minister urged the United States to become more engaged, by </p><p>exchanging proposals for areas of possible cooperation.  The </p><p>COM responded that we expected a visit at the end of March of </p><p>a USG delegation, led by OES DAS Chow, looking to discuss </p><p>matters of health and humanitarian assistance.  The Minister </p><p>responded that he would try to find time on his schedule to </p><p>meet with the delegation. </p><p> </p><p>Action Request </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) For EAP/BCLTV:  Please contact Operation Smile and </p><p>Orbis to relay the Minister\'s message.  Operation Smile, if </p><p>interested in coming to Burma, should consider sending a </p><p>representative to lay the groundwork with key MOH officials. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
