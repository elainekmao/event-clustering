IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: RELATIONS BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND SWEDEN </p><p>FELL TO AN ALL-TIME LOW DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF </p><p>FEBRUARY AS THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT IT </p><p>HAD SUSPENDED BILATERAL AID TO THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS </p><p>MUDENGE RESPONDED ANGRILY, SAYING THAT HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>WOULD REVIEW ITS RELATIONS WITH SWEDEN.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE, THROUGH AN ANONYMOUS </p><p>SPOKESMAN, ALSO IMPLIED THAT THE SWEDISH EMBASSY MIGHT </p><p>NO LONGER BE WELCOME IN ZIMBABWE.  AT A LUNCHEON ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 7, SWEDEN\'S AMBASSADOR TO ZIMBABWE, LENNARTH </p><p>HJELMAKER, CITED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S WISH TO MAKE A </p><p>STRONG STATEMENT OF ITS CONCERN WITH EVENTS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, COUPLED WITH BAD TIMING, AS THE REASON FOR </p><p>THE CURRENT TENSION BETWEEN SWEDEN AND ZIMBABWE. </p><p>AMBASSADOR HJELMAKER DID NOT THINK THAT HE OR HIS </p><p>STAFF WERE IN IMMINENT DANGER OF BEING DECLARED </p><p>PERSONAE NON GRATA, BUT CONCEDED THAT HE WAS WORKING </p><p>HARD TO MANAGE THE DELICATE SITUATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE FEBRUARY 1 ANNOUNCEMENT IN STOCKHOLM THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF SWEDEN WAS SUSPENDING BILATERAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00672  01 OF 02  081521Z </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>DID NOT PLAY WELL IN HARARE.  THE STATE-OWNED DAILY </p><p>NEWSPAPER "THE HERALD" DISTORTED THE FACTS OF THE </p><p>SWEDISH DECISION IN ITS FEBRUARY 2 STORY, CLAIMING </p><p>THAT "SWEDEN...HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS SLASHING AID </p><p>TO THE GOVERNMENT AND WILL CHANNEL ABOUT 400 MILLION </p><p>ZIMBABWE DOLLARS TOWARDS OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS."  WHILE THIS IS </p><p>NOT TRUE (SWEDISH AID SUPPORTS HIV/AIDS PROGRAMS, NON- </p><p>PARTISAN DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS AND DISASTER RELIEF), IT </p><p>PROVIDED RIGHTEOUS HIGH GROUND FOR AN UNNAMED GOZ </p><p>SOURCE WHO WAS QUOTED IN THE "HERALD" REPORT.  THE </p><p>SOURCE SAID "...EMBASSIES WITH NO BUSINESS WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND INTENDING TO CONCENTRATE THEIR EFFORTS </p><p>ON BACKING OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND NON- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, MEDDLING IN THE INTERNAL </p><p>POLITICS OF THE COUNTRY, HAVE NO REASON TO BE HERE... </p><p>THERE IS NO WAY THAT GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE KINDLY TO A </p><p>SITUATION WHERE AN EMBASSY BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL STATE-TO-STATE INTERACTION IS ALLOWED TO </p><p>DE-OFFICIALIZE ITSELF AND BECOME CONDUITS OF FOREIGN </p><p>OFFICIAL SUPPORT TO BOTH THE OPPOSITION AND PARTISAN </p><p>NGOS CREATED BY THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS.  THEY ARE </p><p>BECOMING FEATURES OF SUBVERSION AND EXPECT STATE </p><p>BENEDICTION.  THIS CANNOT BE..." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS MUDENGE ALSO </p><p>REACTED ANGRILY AND PUBLICLY, APPEARING ON STATE- </p><p>CONTROLLED ZBC TELEVISION ON FEBRUARY 5 TO CRITICIZE </p><p>THE SWEDISH DECISION.  MUDENGE SAID THAT HE WOULD </p><p>REVIEW ZIMBABWE\'S RELATIONS WITH SWEDEN, IMPLYING THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00672  01 OF 02  081521Z </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF A DIPLOMATIC RUPTURE BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AT A LUNCHEON IN THE SWISS EMBASSY ON FEBRUARY 7, </p><p>AMBASSADOR HJELMAKER TOLD EMBOFF THAT PART OF THE </p><p>REASON FOR ZIMBABWE\'S ANGER WAS THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>OF THE AID SUSPENSION HAD BEEN BADLY HANDLED.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WANTED TO MAKE A STRONG STATEMENT </p><p>ABOUT ITS CONCERN OVER ZIMBABWE\'S DEPARTURE FROM </p><p>DEMOCRATIC NORMS, BUT THAT BAD TIMING IN STOCKHOLM AND </p><p>HARARE MEANT THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT TOOK ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY BY SURPRISE.  HJELMAKER SAID THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S AMBASSADOR TO SWEDEN HAD BEEN OUT OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY WHEN THE SWEDES DECIDED IN LATE JANUARY TO </p><p>SUSPEND BILATERAL AID.  SWEDISH PROCEDURE IS THAT </p><p>GOVERNMENT DECISIONS ARE GAZETTED ON THE FIRST OF EACH </p><p>MONTH ("...JUST PART OF OUR OPEN DEMOCRACY..." SAID </p><p>HJELMAKER), SO THE DECISION WAS PUBLISHED BEFORE THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN AMBASSADOR COULD BE NOTIFIED.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE AND AMBASSADOR HJELMAKER WERE </p><p>BOTH ABSENT FROM HARARE DURING THE LAST WEEK OF </p><p>JANUARY, SO A SUBORDINATE AT THE SWEDISH EMBASSY ONLY </p><p>INFORMED THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (THROUGH WHICH ALL </p><p>BILATERAL ASSISTANCE IS CHANNELED) OF THE SUSPENSION. </p><p>THESE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES MEANT THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO6270 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00672  02 OF 02  081521Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------C2E945  081521Z /38 </p><p>P 081523Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8194 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000672 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>STOCKHOLM FOR MILOVANOVICH </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SA C.

HJELMAKER TOLD EMBOFF THAT MUDENGE WAS </p><p>INFURIATED, AND EXCORIATED THE AMBASSADOR FOR THIS </p><p>BREACH OF PROTOCOL. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE SWEDES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY STALWART </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF ROBERT MUGABE\'S ZIMBABWE AND VERY GENEROUS </p><p>PROVIDERS OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.  GIVEN THAT </p><p>HISTORY, THEIR DECISION TO SUSPEND FUNDING OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROGRAMS HERE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT DEEPENING OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ISOLATION FROM WESTERN DEMOCRACIES.  SWEDEN\'S </p><p>LACK OF A COLONIAL HISTORY IN AFRICA, OR OF OTHER </p><p>IMPERIALISTIC CREDENTIALS, MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE TO DISMISS THE SUSPENSION OF </p><p>AID AS PART OF THE "BRITISH-IMPERIALIST PLOT" TO RUIN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  NONETHELESS, THE UNNAMED GOZ SOURCE DID TELL </p><p>"THE HERALD" THAT "THE SWEDES ARE NOW INCREASINGLY </p><p>REDUCING THEMSELVES TO AN APPENDAGE OF WHITEHALL." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG HISTORY OF </p><p>SUPPORT FOR ZIMBABWE AND THEIR TRADITION OF </p><p>NEUTRALITY, THE SWEDES ARE UNLIKELY TO BE THROWN OUT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE.  THIS EPISODE DOES, HOWEVER, SUGGEST THE </p><p>NEED FOR CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED NOTIFICATION IF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES EVER NEEDS TO DELIVER BAD NEWS TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00672  02 OF 02  081521Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
