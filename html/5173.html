(SBU)  The Vietnamese Ministry of Trade has responded </p><p>to Secretary of Commerce Evans\' letter of December 12, 2002 </p><p>with a letter from Minister of Trade Tuyen - text follows in </p><p>para 2. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Begin text of letter - original will not be </p><p>forwarded: </p><p> </p><p>(Informal Translation by MOT) </p><p> </p><p>MINISTRY OF TRADE </p><p>The Socialist Republic of Vietnam </p><p> </p><p>Hanoi, January 15, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>H.E. Mr. Donald L. Evans </p><p>Secretary of Commerce </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>United States Department of Commerce </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Secretary, </p><p> </p><p>I acknowledge with many thanks the receipt on 3rd January, </p><p>2003 of your letter dated 12th December, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>It is obvious that we have different points of view </p><p>regarding the market nature of Vietnam\'s economy.  The </p><p>Ministry of Trade of Vietnam will send its rebuttal comment </p><p>on DOC\'s ME/NME conclusion of 8th November 2002 to you soon. </p><p>I believe you and I have shared responsibility to help </p><p>narrow our differences with a view to fostering Vietnam - US </p><p>trade relations, thus promoting the multifaceted relations </p><p>between the two countries toward the implementation of </p><p>President Bush\'s initiative recently proposed to ASEAN </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p>In this spirit, the Ministry of Trade expresses its great </p><p>concerns over the attempts by a number of US domestic shrimp </p><p>producers seeking unfair protection by abusing the US </p><p>safeguard measures and anti-dumping laws to restrict shrimp </p><p>imports from Vietnam and other countries.  I would like to </p><p>take this opportunity to reaffirm that Vietnam does not dump </p><p>either shrimps or frozen Basa and Tra fish (catfish) filets </p><p>into the US market.  I would like, therefore, to </p><p>respectfully ask you, in your high capacity, to handle the </p><p>issues in a fair and just manner, to avoid any negative </p><p>implication for the on-going fine development of the overall </p><p>trade relations between the two countries against the </p><p>backdrop of our historic BTA. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the DOC\'s ongoing investigation of the petition </p><p>against certain frozen fish fillets from Vietnam, I would </p><p>like to draw your attention to the active and constructive </p><p>cooperation from the Vietnamese exporters concerned in </p><p>providing fully and promptly within a short period of time </p><p>all the information that the DOC has requested.  They have </p><p>made such enormous efforts with a strong belief that the DOC </p><p>shall undertake a careful and accurate analysis and come at </p><p>an impartial and fair conclusion of the case as the </p><p>officials from your High Department have more than once </p><p>assured to the Vietnamese government and businesses. </p><p>Whereas we always highly appreciate these commitments, I </p><p>would like to reiterate our hope to see those assurances in </p><p>the Department\'s deeds.  While we do not share the DOC\'s </p><p>conclusion of NME status of Vietnam, I would like to restate </p><p>our request that the DOC accept Bangladesh as the surrogate </p><p>country should the DOC consider using a third country\'s data </p><p>to estimate comparable production costs. </p><p> </p><p>On the other hand, the Ministry of Trade of Vietnam has been </p><p>informed of the US Department of Commerce\'s suggestion to </p><p>consider a Suspension Agreement (SA), which was briefed to </p><p>us by Mr. Joseph Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for </p><p>Import Administration during his official trip to Hanoi in </p><p>the week of 17th December, 2002.  I would like to stress, </p><p>however, that the Vietnamese government and businesses </p><p>involved would be in a position to consider this option only </p><p>on the basis of a fair and accurate preliminary </p><p>determination by the DOC to be made on 24th January, 2003. </p><p>An unreasonably high tariff rate would be detrimental to the </p><p>bilateral trade relations between our two countries in </p><p>general and to the interests of both producers and consumers </p><p>in particular, and therefore would be unacceptable to us. </p><p>(EMBASSY NOTE:  We checked this rather confusing translation </p><p>but unfortunately, this paragraph was no clearer in the </p><p>original Vietnamese and so we can offer no further </p><p>clarification. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>It is my hope that my concerns will receive your kind </p><p>consideration on the basis of constructive cooperation to </p><p>the further development of Vietnam - US trade relations. </p><p> </p><p>Looking forward to your positive respond, I would like to </p><p>take this opportunity to renew to you, Mr. Secretary, the </p><p>assurances of my highest consideration. </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely yours, </p><p> </p><p>Truong Dinh Tuyen </p><p>Minister of Trade of Vietnam </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
