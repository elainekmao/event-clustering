<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001919 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2011 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ECIN, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA PASSES SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET EQUAL TO USD </p><p>1.8 BILLION </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  EconOff met with Dr. Joseph Nnanna, </p><p>Director of Research at the Central Bank of Nigeria, on July </p><p>25 and Representative Mohammed Daggash, Chairman of the House </p><p>Finance Committee, on July 26.  Both Messrs. Nnanna and </p><p>Daggash asserted that the Second Supplementary Appropriation </p><p>Act, signed by President Obasanjo on July 14, would not lead </p><p>to increased capital spending.  Both men also projected that </p><p>President Obasanjo would wait until after the IMF extended </p><p>the Stand-by Arrangement on August 3 before releasing second </p><p>quarter expenditures.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 14, President Obasanjo signed into law the </p><p>First and Second Supplementary Appropriation Bills.  The </p><p>First Supplementary Appropriation Bill provides </p><p>N5,488,714,710 (circa USD 49 million) for the purchase of a </p><p>Gulf Stream Presidential aircraft.  The Lower House of the </p><p>National Assembly resisted for weeks the aircraft purchase, </p><p>but conceded shortly after a Joint Finance Committee session </p><p>in early July.  Representative Daggash explained that he had </p><p>not supported the Bill because the price of the Gulf Stream </p><p>had been cushioned to allow for kickbacks to government </p><p>officials.  He also complained that the decision to purchase </p><p>from Gulf Stream was arbitrary, opaque and without a public </p><p>tender.  (Comment.  It is possible that the House consented </p><p>to the aircraft purchase in exchange for a large increase in </p><p>the National Assembly\'s recurrent expenditure budget.  The </p><p>Second Supplementary Bill increased the National Assembly\'s </p><p>2001 recurrent expenditures by N2.4 billion (USD 21.4 </p><p>million) against the President\'s originally submitted </p><p>increase of N500 million (USD 4.5 million).  Mission was told </p><p>the normal list price for the aircraft in question is $37 </p><p>million, and that $1 million would be required to outfit it </p><p>as the Presidential aircraft.  Mission is unable to confirm </p><p>those figures.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Second Supplementary Appropriation Bill totals </p><p>N146,875,600,000 (USD 1.3 billion) with just over N120 </p><p>billion (USD 1.07 billion) in capital expenditures.  The </p><p>largest recipients of additional capital expenditures are: </p><p>the Ministry of Power and Steel with N25 billion (USD 223 </p><p>million); Ministry of Defense (rehabilitation program) with </p><p>N23 billion (USD 205 million); Ministry of Works and Housing </p><p>with N21 billion (USD 187.5 million); and the Ministry of </p><p>Federal Capital Territory with N12 billion (USD 107 million). </p><p> Those four ministries combined received two-thirds of the </p><p>supplementary budget\'s capital expenditures.  Other </p><p>recipients included the National Assembly, Ministry of </p><p>Health, Ministry of Industries, Ministry of Water Resources, </p><p>Ministry of Education, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the </p><p>Poverty Eradication Programme. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Dr. Nnanna at the Central Bank explained that the </p><p>IMF Stand-by Arrangement, which provides for due diligence on </p><p>all capital projects, has slowed significantly the release of </p><p>funds from GON coffers.  He said that the World Bank was </p><p>assisting the GON to conduct these audits.  According to IMF </p><p>Deputy Resident Representative Jonathan Dunn, the audits for </p><p>the 2001 Appropriations Bill have been completed.  Although </p><p>Dr. Nnanna felt certain that the GON would not spend more </p><p>than the original 2001 Appropriations Bill allows (N496 </p><p>billion (USD 4.4 billion)), he believed that the President </p><p>would spend more in the second half of the year than in the </p><p>first half because of domestic political pressure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Representative Daggash said that the Second </p><p>Supplementary Bill is more of a revision of the 2001 </p><p>Appropriations Act and less of a supplement.  He complained </p><p>that, in this way, the Presidency was able to circumvent </p><p>constitutional procedures for revising an existing law. </p><p>Daggash explained that the projects identified in the </p><p>Supplementary Act would be undertaken instead of, not in </p><p>addition to, projects in the 2001 Appropriations Bill.  He </p><p>said specifically that the President would likely renege on </p><p>his earlier concession to spend N500 million (USD 4.5 </p><p>million) on capital projects in each senatorial district </p><p>(totaling N55 billion (USD 491 million)). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to the IMF\'s Dunn, on August 3 the IMF will </p><p>formally grant a technical extension of the SBA until October </p><p>to allow the GON more time to complete the benchmarks from </p><p>the December review.  Daggash suggested that the Presidency </p><p>would wait until after the IMF grants this extension before </p><p>releasing second and third quarter expenditures.  However, </p><p>Dunn said, if the GON releases large expenditures in August, </p><p>the IMF will not likely grant a follow-on facility after the </p><p>SBA expires in October. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment.  President Obasanjo has put himself in a </p><p>difficult position.  On one hand, he promised the IMF he </p><p>would restrain capital spending to far less than the 2001 </p><p>Budget allocations of N496 billion (USD 4.4 billion) in order </p><p>to stabilize the macroeconomy and provide for better </p><p>accountability of capital projects.  On the other hand, the </p><p>President has promised power-brokers, cronies and political </p><p>allies that now he would spend N616 billion (USD 5.5 billion) </p><p>in capital projects to build new roads, railways, a national </p><p>stadium, and other high-priced projects.  When the President </p><p>last released funds to the federal government in February </p><p>2001, inflation skyrocketed and the Naira weakened </p><p>significantly.  Domestic inputs (services, goods and labor) </p><p>usually account for less than 50% of the value of a contract. </p><p> By most accounts, between 70 and 85% of the average GON </p><p>contract\'s Naira value goes into flight capital or purchases </p><p>of goods and services denominated in hard currency.  Any </p><p>significant release of Naira causes demand for hard currency </p><p>to spike, so the Naira plunges. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment continued: A falling Naira and rising </p><p>prices hurt the President\'s public image.  By throttling </p><p>capital expenditures, he has stabilized the Naira, but has </p><p>not brought domestic inflation under control.  His efforts to </p><p>stem the Naira\'s decline are seriously undermining domestic </p><p>productivity and, by reducing supply, contributing to </p><p>inflationary pressures.  Meanwhile, demand for money in the </p><p>economy is creating enormous pressures on the President to </p><p>release GON funds.  It therefore is likely that he will </p><p>release second quarter expenditures soon after the IMF </p><p>extension is granted on August 3.  Unfortunately, the </p><p>macroeconomic effects of the spending are well known and well </p><p>tested: excess liquidity, higher inflation, and a falling </p><p>Naira.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
