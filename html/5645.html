Under headline "Africa opposes war on Iraq" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" </p><p>      dedicated its February 9 editorial to </p><p>      reiterating the anti-war positions taken by the </p><p>      African Union (AU) and former South African </p><p>      President, Nelson Mandela.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Two days before American Secretary of State, </p><p>      Colin Powell presented his `evidence\' of Iraq\'s </p><p>      supposed `material breach\' of U. N. Resolution 1441, </p><p>      the African Union (AU) issued a declaration against </p><p>      the planned war on Iraq.  The AU is of the opinion </p><p>      that military confrontation wit Iraq would be a </p><p>      destabilizing factor not only for the Middle East, but </p><p>      for the whole of Africa as well.  Even after the much </p><p>      awaited and largely disappointing speech by Colin </p><p>      Powell, African leaders are not convinced that war on </p><p>      Iraq is necessary.  In response to Powell, the South </p><p>      African government issued a statement warning the U. </p><p>      S. not to rush into war, as such an action would be </p><p>      catastrophic. The African condemnation of the American </p><p>      war on Iraq has been strongly expressed by the former </p><p>      South African President, Nelson Mandela.  The African </p><p>      statesman said that Powell\'s presentation was not </p><p>      convincing and that only the U.N. inspectors can </p><p>      determine whether or not Iraq possesses any weapons of </p><p>      mass destruction.  Mandela summed up the general </p><p>      feeling of the anti-war group when he said: `One power </p><p>      with a president who has no foresight and cannot think </p><p>      properly is now wanting to plunge the world into a </p><p>      holocaust.\'" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
