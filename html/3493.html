ARAGONA NOTED THAT MOST OF </p><p>ITALY\'S AFGHAN AID CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CHANNELED THROUGH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (IOS) RATHER THAN DISPERSED </p><p>DIRECTLY OR THROUGH NGOS.  CAUTIONING THAT SUCH IOS CAN BE A </p><p>CUMBERSOME MECHANISM OF DISBURSEMENT, HE URGED THE USG TO </p><p>JOIN THE GOI IN IMPRESSING UPON THEM THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>QUICKLY GENERATING TANGIBLE BENEFITS FOR WHICH CREDIT WILL GO </p><p>TO THE ATA.  HE PROMISED TO TRY TO SPEED ITALIAN </p><p>DISBURSEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>COOPERATIVE APPROACH </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  A/DCM MET ON AUGUST 8 WITH MFA POLITICAL DIRECTOR </p><p>GIANCARLO ARAGONA, HIS DEPUTY, CLAUDIO BISOGNIERO, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03959  130740Z </p><p>SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR AFGHANISTAN ENRICO DE MAIO TO DISCUSS </p><p>AFGHAN AID (AND OTHER ISSUES REPORTED SEPTEL).  A/DCM </p><p>RECOGNIZED ITALY\'S EXISTING FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, COMMITMENTS TO OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, </p><p>STABILIZATION EFFORTS AS WELL AS LEADERSHIP IN THE AREA OF </p><p>AFGHAN JUDICIAL REFORM.  HE THEN ASKED HOW, AS PARTNERS, WE </p><p>COULD USE OUR ASSISTANCE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT THE </p><p>STABILITY AND VIABILITY OF THE ATA.  HE ALSO ASKED </p><p>SPECIFICALLY WHETHER THE USD SEVEN MILLION ITALY PLEDGED TO </p><p>THE WORLD BANK\'S AFGHAN RECONSTRUCTION TRUST FUND HAD BEEN </p><p>DISPERSED.  HE UNDERSCORED THE NEED TO GET ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN RAPIDLY. </p><p> </p><p>WE NEED TO MOVE FURTHER DOWN THE FUNDING PIPELINE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  ARAGONA "FULLY AGREED" WITH WHAT HE CALLED "A SOUND </p><p>POLITICAL OBJECTIVE" OF ENHANCING THE ATA AND KARZAI\'S </p><p>CREDIBILITY AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE.  HE NOTED THAT ITALY </p><p>PLEDGED USD 47 MILLION TO AFGHANISTAN IN TOKYO.  ALL OF IT, </p><p>HE SAID, HAS NOW BEEN COMMITTED AND THE CHANNELS FOR ITS </p><p>DISBURSEMENT IDENTIFIED.  HE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT SINCE </p><p>MOST OF THE AID IS GOING THROUGH IOS (ARAGONA MENTIONED THE </p><p>WORLD BANK AND UNDP IN PARTICULAR), HE UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>DIFFICULTY OF ENSURING THAT KARZAI AND THE ATA GET CREDIT FOR </p><p>THE ENSUING PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS.  ARAGONA PROMISED TO MAKE </p><p>THE POINT TO IOS THAT EMPHASIS MUST BE GIVEN TO RAISING THE </p><p>PROFILE OF THE ATA.  HE URGED THE USG DO SO AS WELL, </p><p>SUGGESTING THAT DONOR COUNTRIES SHOULD UNDERSCORE THE </p><p>IMPERATIVE OF USING ASSISTANCE TO ENSURE THAT TANGIBLE </p><p>PROJECTS ARE SEEN SOON AND ARE LINKED IN THE PUBLIC MIND TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03959  130740Z </p><p>THE FUNCTIONING OF THE ATA.  ARAGONA PROMISED THAT THE GOI </p><p>WOULD REVIEW ITALY\'S COMMITMENTS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE ATA AND STABILIZE AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR AFGHANISTAN ENRICO DE MAIO </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT ITALY HAS ALREADY GIVEN HALF OF ITS TOKYO </p><p>PLEDGE.  HE HAS REQUESTED THE OFFICE OF COOPERATION TO </p><p>PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF AFGHAN AID AND EXPECTS TO </p><p>HAVE MORE DETAILS IN THE COMING DAYS.  DE MAIO ADDED THAT </p><p>DONORS SHOULD DO MORE THAN ADVISE THE IOS TO ENSURE PROJECTS </p><p>REFLECT CREDIT ON THE ATA; "WE SHOULD INSTRUCT THEM" TO WORK </p><p>MORE QUICKLY AND TO EMPHASIZE THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\'S ROLE. </p><p>HE SUGGESTED DONORS NEGOTIATE CONDITIONALITIES TO THEIR </p><p>FUNDING WHICH STIPULATE RAPID DELIVERABLES LINKED TO THE ATA. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  THE ITALIANS TAKE OUR PRINCIPAL POINTS AND ARE </p><p>COMMITTED TO REVIEWING THEIR ASSISTANCE TO LEVERAGE ITS </p><p>POLITICAL VALUE FOR THE ATA -- SOONER, RATHER THAN LATER. </p><p>POST SECONDS THE GOI SUGGESTION THAT WE AND OTHER DONORS </p><p>DRIVE THE MESSAGE HOME TO THE IOS AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>6.
