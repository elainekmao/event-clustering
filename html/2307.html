PER DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE, THE FOLLOWING IS KEYED TO </p><p>REFTEL AND CONSTITUTES POST\'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANNUAL </p><p>TERRORISM REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>KING MOHAMMED VI AND THE GOM STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE </p><p>ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11 AND HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF </p><p>THE ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAIDA AND THE TALIBAN. </p><p>FOLLOWING THE ATTACKS, KING MOHAMMED PLEDGED MOROCCO\'S </p><p>FULL COOPERATION IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SUPPORT, THE GOM SIGNED THE UN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE </p><p>FINANCING OF TERRORISM ON SEPTEMBER 24, AND IT IS </p><p>COMPLYING WITH UNSCR RESOLUTIONS ON TERRORIST FINANCING. </p><p> </p><p>B)  THER WERE NO THWARTED TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR </p><p>TERRORIT CELLS DISRUPTED BY THE GOM THAT WERE MADE </p><p>PUBLICLY KNOWN IN 2001.  HISTORICALLY, THE GOM HAS BEEN </p><p>EXTREMELY VIGILANT IN REGARD TO SUSPECT TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND HAS STRONGLY REACTED TO POTENTIAL </p><p>THREATS.  IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT DOMESTIC TERRORISM </p><p>IS LARGELY UNHEARD OF IN MOROCCO. </p><p> </p><p>C)  IN 2001, THE GOM DID NOT ISSUE ANY SIGNIFICANT NEW </p><p>LAWS CONCERNING TERRORISM.  THE PENAL CODE REGARDING </p><p>SUSPECT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAS ALWAYS WEIGHED HEAVILY </p><p>TOWARDS SECURITY CONCERNS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO </p><p>U.S. INTERESTS IN MOROCCO. </p><p> </p><p>D)  THERE WERE NO REQUESTS ON THE PART OF THE GOM FOR </p><p>THE EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN 2001. </p><p> </p><p>E)  ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE </p><p>USG AND GOM, POST DOES NOT PERCEIVE THERE WOULD BE ANY </p><p>SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO GOM PROSECUTION AND/OR </p><p>EXTRADITION OF KNOWN TERRORIST THAT ARE NOT MOROCAN </p><p>NATIONALS. </p><p> </p><p>F)  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, KING </p><p>MOHAMMED ISSUED A STRONG PUBLIC CONDEMNATION AGAINST </p><p>THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THE ATTACKS AND TERRORIST ACTS IN </p><p>GENERAL.  THE GOM TRADITIONALLY ISSUES PUBLIC STATEMENTS </p><p>IN OPPOSITION TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE GOM HAS </p><p>PLEDGED ITS FULL SUPPORT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS AND OTHER ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>G)  IN LATE SEPTEMBER 2001, THE GOM SIGNED THE UN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE </p><p>FINANCING OF TERRORISM AND AGREED TO BLOCK AND FREEZE </p><p>TERRORIST-RELATED ACCOUNTS. </p><p> </p><p>H)  THE GOM DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, </p><p>TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>I)  THE GOM HAS NOT ISSUED ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE SEVEN GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY THE </p><p>SECRETARY AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.  HOWEVER, </p><p>IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, SYRIA AND SUDAN HAVE DIPLOMATS </p><p>ACCREDITED TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO. </p><p> </p><p>J)  THE GOM CONTINUES TO STRONGLY CONDEMN ALL TERRORISM </p><p>AND TERRORIST ACTS. </p><p> </p><p>K) THE USG AND GOM HAVE COOPERATED CLOSELY ON </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS, ALL OF WHICH REMAIN </p><p>UNPUBLICIZED. </p><p> </p><p>L) DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS, THE USG HAS NOT </p><p>SOUGHT GOM SUPPORT IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION </p><p>OF AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. </p><p>CITIZENS OR U.S. INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>M)  THE GOM ROUTINELY COOPERATES WITH THE USG TO ENSURE </p><p>THE SAFETY OF U.S. CITIZENS AND INTERESTS IN MOROCCO. </p><p>AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, THE GOM QUICKLY AND POSITIVELY </p><p>RESPONDED TO POST\'S REQUEST FOR INCREASED SECURITY FOR </p><p>USG PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>TUTWILER </p><p></p></div>
