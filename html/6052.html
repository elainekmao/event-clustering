(U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for </p><p>       reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) In advance of the March 3-6 WTO services </p><p>negotiations in Geneva, UAE Ministry of Economy Director </p><p>of WTO Affairs Saeed Al-Nasibi publicly announced </p><p>on March 2 that the UAE does not intend to open its </p><p>banking, insurance, telecommunications and other services </p><p>sectors to foreign investors at this time -- despite </p><p>expected pressure from "industrialized nations," left </p><p>unnamed, later this week.  Comment: While such a position </p><p>may be unhelpful, the UAE is under no obligation to open </p><p>up those sectors it specifically set aside under the terms </p><p>of its accession to the WTO in 1996; they are in fact </p><p>"unbound," and the UAE\'s exemptions are indefinite in </p><p>duration.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Al-Nasibi, the UAE has little incentive </p><p>to license new foreign banks because it is the "most </p><p>over-banked country in the world, based on the number </p><p>of banks per capita" -- foreign banks outnumber national </p><p>banks, 26 to 21.  He elaborated, however, that foreign banks </p><p>are permitted to open representative offices here.  (Note: </p><p>This is a well-worn argument of the UAE Central Bank, which </p><p>since 1987 has largely enforced a ban on new foreign full- </p><p>service banking operations.  End note.)  Al-Nasibi also </p><p>stated that the UAEG would continue to give preference to </p><p>UAE nationals -- in effect denying national treatment to </p><p>foreign investors -- in the services sector to encourage </p><p>citizens to invest in their country. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) According to press reports, Al-Nasibi will chair </p><p>the UAE delegation to Geneva for the March 3-6 WTO services </p><p>negotiations.  Representatives from the UAE Labor Ministry, </p><p>Central Bank, Etisalat (the UAE\'s monopoly telecom provider), </p><p>and the Federations of Chambers of Commerce will also attend. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
