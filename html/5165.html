<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000178 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, IZ, CA, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN POSITION ON IRAQ UNCHANGED </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) OTTAWA 49 (B) 02 OTTAWA 3502 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Despite Prime Minister Chretien\'s January 15 comment </p><p>that "the international community must speak and act through </p><p>the UN Security Council," Canada\'s position on military </p><p>participation in a potential war against Iraq is unchanged. </p><p>Contacts at Foreign Affairs and National Defense assured us </p><p>on January 16 that the Canadian response to our request for a </p><p>military contribution (given to the State Department in </p><p>December - reftels) remains the same: Canada will participate </p><p>militarily if there is a UN-sanctioned campaign, and reserves </p><p>judgement on participation if there is no explicit UNSC </p><p>authorization. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Defense Minister McCallum made this position - </p><p>including the possibility that Canada would participate in a </p><p>campaign not endorsed by the UN - very clear in a press </p><p>conference following his January 9 meeting with Secretary </p><p>Rumsfeld, to the consternation of the left wing of the ruling </p><p>Liberal Party.  Several backbench Liberal MPs complained </p><p>afterward that Canada should only support military action </p><p>blessed by the UNSC, and some called for debate in Parliament </p><p>on the Canadian position.  The Prime Minister, who never </p><p>likes to commit himself earlier than necessary on </p><p>controversial issues, was not pleased.  He told the press </p><p>that McCallum "replied to a hypothetical question that he has </p><p>reflected upon and corrected since that time."  Chretien </p><p>reaffirmed McCallum\'s statement that Canada would participate </p><p>in a UNSC-blessed operation, but refused to speculate on </p><p>whether Canada would join a campaign not endorsed by the UN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) McCallum, a professional economist who became Defense </p><p>Minister in May 2002 and was first elected to Parliament in </p><p>2000, is still learning the ropes of Cabinet politics, </p><p>including the finer points of obfuscating before the media. </p><p>He violated one of Chretien\'s basic rules - not to infringe </p><p>upon the Prime Minister\'s room for maneuver - and was put </p><p>down for his efforts.  We continue to believe that Canada </p><p>would join a coalition of the willing in a campaign against </p><p>Iraq, even if the Security Council were divided, but that </p><p>Chretien would prefer to avoid having to make that </p><p>politically tough decision. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
