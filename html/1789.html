<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001531 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ETHNIC CONFLICT IN NASARAWA PEACEFUL NOW, </p><p>BUT VERY TENSE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1461 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary.  Ethnic clashes in the Middle-Belt State of </p><p>Nasarawa appear to have halted for the moment, although </p><p>tension throughout the state is running high.  The federal </p><p>government has sent additional security forces into troubled </p><p>areas.  Approximately 40,000 displaced persons, mainly Tivs, </p><p>have fled to neighboring Benue State.  Most have moved in </p><p>with friends and family, with about 4,000 accomodated in two </p><p>camps north of the capital city of Makurdi.  Displaced </p><p>persons, mainly Hausa-speakers, have fled to Lafia, capital </p><p>of Nasarawa, with 3,000 now at a converted primary school. </p><p>Both Nasarawa and Benue State governments have responded </p><p>quickly to the evolving situation, earning praise from </p><p>International Red Cross (IRC) officials.  The IRC will </p><p>mobilize from its depot in Lagos, providing non-food items </p><p>(blankets, cooking sets, soap, etc.).  Governor Adamu of </p><p>Nasarawa and Governor Akume of Benue will jointly convene a </p><p>meeting of elected and traditional leaders June 29 to </p><p>continue efforts at reconcilation, and encourage displaced </p><p>persons to return home.   End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Conflicting reports continue of clashes between rival </p><p>ethnic groups in the southeast corner of Nasarawa State, a </p><p>Middle-Belt State located immediately to the east of the </p><p>Federal Capital Territory.  Nasarawa Deputy Governor Onje </p><p>Gye-Wado told Poloff June 29 that the situation throughout </p><p>the state was "extremely tense."  According to the Deputy </p><p>Governor, no confirmed clashes had occured in the last 48 </p><p>hours, although he noted it was very difficult to secure </p><p>accurate information from remote villages in the south-east </p><p>corner of the state.  A number of villages in the three Local </p><p>Government Areas now the scene of the conflict (Awe, Obi, and </p><p>Keana) had been entirely abandoned by their residents, he </p><p>said.  Additional security forces had been requested from the </p><p>Federal Government, said Gye-Wado, and they now maintained a </p><p>"very uneasy" peace.  Reached by telephone June 28, the </p><p>Deputy Police Commissioner for Federal Operations confirmed </p><p>the dispatch of a fourth mobile police unit from the Federal </p><p>Capital Territory to Nasarawa, as well as the reassignment of </p><p>mobile police units from Jigawa, Anambra and Enugu States. </p><p>The police official said the mobile units were "in charge" of </p><p>the situation, following clashes earlier in the week which </p><p>left three police officers dead. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Poloff also reached Governor George Akume of Benue </p><p>State June 28.  Governor Akume spoke at some length on the </p><p>plight of ethnic Tivs fleeing from Nasarawa (Akume is himself </p><p>a Tiv, as are the majority of Benue State citizens).  He </p><p>emphasized several times the importance of establishing a </p><p>firm peace and coaxing displaced persons to return to their </p><p>homes.  "This is planting season, and the Tivs who have left </p><p>are mainly farmers.  They need to care for their lands." </p><p>Akume confirmed continung efforts by the Nasarawa and Benue </p><p>governments to mediate between the rival ethnic groups (Tivs, </p><p>Jukuns, Hausa-speakers, and Kwala).  A meeting had been set </p><p>for June 29 of elected and traditional leadership of both </p><p>States in Lafia to discuss the situation, he said.  He said </p><p>that the IRC and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) had been on </p><p>the scene and assisting State officials with arriving </p><p>villagers, and he expected help from the National Emergency </p><p>Management Agency (NEMA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Head of the International Red Cross in Nigeria </p><p>Jean-Jacques Gacond told Poloff June 29 that approximately </p><p>40,000 displaced persons, mainly Tivs, had fled Nasarawa </p><p>State into Benue State to the south.  About 4,000 of them </p><p>were now residing at two camps north of Makurdi, at Dauda and </p><p>Uikpam.  The rest of the arriving villagers, registered at an </p><p>initial transit point, had found refuge with family and </p><p>friends in the area.  Gacond said that State government </p><p>officials had done "fairly well" under the circumstances in </p><p>quickly accomodating the displaced villagers.  He noted that </p><p>adequate food and water was on hand for the arrivals, but </p><p>there were shortages of certain items such as blankets, </p><p>cooking sets, and soap.  Sanitation could also be "improved," </p><p>he said.  The IRC would mobilize from its Lagos depot he </p><p>added, sending items that were lacking.  Gacond also said </p><p>that about 3,000 displaced villagers, mainly Hausa-speakers, </p><p>had arrived in Lafia in Nasarawa, and were now residing at a </p><p>converted primary school.  The Nasarawa State government, he </p><p>said, had also reacted quickly and was adequately caring for </p><p>the arrivals.  He estimated that, as in Makurdi, a number of </p><p>arriving villagers had moved in with family and friends, but </p><p>he had no hard figures.  The main State hospital in Lafia had </p><p>also been coping well with villagers injured in the latest </p><p>round of reprisal attacks over the previous week-end </p><p>(particularly disturbing, said Gacond, were the several dozen </p><p>women and children injured in the assaults, many bearing </p><p>knife and machete wounds).  Overall, he said, the two </p><p>governments had done a much better job in dealing with the </p><p>sudden influx of displaced persons than Kaduna State in </p><p>February of last year (when tens of thousands of people fled </p><p>Kaduna during religious riots). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment.  Bitter conflict over land and community </p><p>status in Nasarawa, as noted reftel, has led to nearly 50,000 </p><p>villagers fleeing the areas of actual fighting, most of them </p><p>ethnic Tivs.  Most have found friends and family to assist </p><p>them, and the rest have been accomodated by State Governments </p><p>reacting quickly to the crisis. (We note, in passing, the </p><p>equally generous reception the federal government gave to the </p><p>Ulnar at Apapa Port in Lagos earlier this week.  Never shy to </p><p>report in our cables on Nigeria\'s various failings, we see </p><p>two positive examples this week of Nigerian government in </p><p>action).  Efforts by the two State Governments to calm the </p><p>various communities, and coax frightened villagers to return </p><p>to their communities, will be difficult.  End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
