A. KATHMANDU 154 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B. KATHMANDU 169 </p><p>     C. C. KATHMANDU 137 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On January 29, the Maoists followed by the Government </p><p>of Nepal (GoN) announced a cease-fire.  The GoN (see </p><p>paragraph 13), in return, agreed to drop the terrorist </p><p>designation placed on the Maoists. In their statement (see </p><p>paragraph 12), the Maoists reiterated their demands for a </p><p>round table conference, interim government, and a </p><p>constitutional assembly.  Dates and venue for impending </p><p>negotiations have not yet been established.  The political </p><p>parties are cautiously optimistic but are still establishing </p><p>strategies in the wake of the announcement.  How the </p><p>ceasefire may affect security forces operations and the </p><p>general strike previously announced by the Maoists for </p><p>February 13-14 remains unclear.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Cease-fire Announced </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) At 18:00 on January 29, the Maoists issued a press </p><p>release declaring a cease-fire (Ref B).  The Government of </p><p>Nepal (GoN) followed with its own announcement a few hours </p><p>subsequently.  The Maoist press statement (Paragraph 12) </p><p>states that the GoN had met the minimum conditions for </p><p>talks--removal of the terrorist designation, withdrawal of </p><p>the INTERPOL warrants, removal of bounties on the Maoist </p><p>leadership, and declaration of a cease-fire--but did not </p><p>identify commitments the Maoists made to the government.  The </p><p>release also called upon the party\'s membership to work in </p><p>accordance with the declared cease-fire and mobilize in </p><p>support of its minimum demands:  a round table conference, an </p><p>interim government, and a constitutional assembly. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Neither the GoN or the Maoists have agreed to a date </p><p>or venue for negotiations.  According to press sources, the </p><p>Maoists have formed a three member negotiating team, </p><p>including top idealogue Baburam Bhattarai, Krishna Bahadur </p><p>Mahara (who had headed the Maoists\' previous negotating </p><p>team), and Dev Gurung.  The GoN\'s press release designates </p><p>Minister for Works and Physical Planning Narayan Singh Pun to </p><p>serve as the GoN\'s coordinator for negotiations.  According </p><p>to Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Welfare </p><p>Anuradha Koirala, there is no decision on who will lead the </p><p>delegation or its members. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Getting the Parties Onboard </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) From press reports and Embassy contacts, it appears </p><p>that only the National Democratic Party (RPP) leadership was </p><p>consulted prior to the announced cease-fire.  The local press </p><p>reported that the King held a meeting with RPP leader Surya </p><p>Bahadur Thapa on January 28 to discuss peace talks and </p><p>conditions.  (Comment:  As Prime Minister Chand is a member </p><p>of the RPP, it is likely that Thapa was aware of the </p><p>developments.  It is also unlikely the King felt it necessary </p><p>to call a separate meeting with the Nepal Sadbhavana Party, </p><p>as Deputy Prime Minister Mandal is its leader.  End Comment.) </p><p> The local press also reported that both Girija Prasad </p><p>Koirala, President of the Nepali Congress Party (NC), and </p><p>Mahdav Kumar Nepal, General Secretary of the Nepal Communist </p><p>Party-United Marxist Leninist (UML), declined to meet with </p><p>the King on January 29. We have been unable to verify this </p><p>report (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Party Perspectives </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Nepali Congress (NC):  Narhari Acharya of the NC, a </p><p>member of the GoN\'s previous negotiating team, told the </p><p>Embassy that while the cease-fire is a positive step and a </p><p>dramatic shift for the Cabinet, but noted it was done without </p><p>consulting the Party.  The lack of transparency on the terms </p><p>and conditions are problematic.  As a former negotiator, </p><p>Acharya feels the terms and conditions should be made public </p><p>so failure can be appropriately assigned. </p><p>6. (U) Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist Leninist (UML): </p><p>According to the Party\'s headquarters, the UML was not </p><p>consulted prior to the cease-fire announcement.  Despite this </p><p>drawback, the UML hopes the negotiations will be successful. </p><p>In a January 29 statement at the UML\'s General Convention, </p><p>now being held in Janakpur, UML Leader Nepal stated, "...we </p><p>do not rule out the possibility of constituent assembly as an </p><p>alternative to resolve the current crisis dogging the </p><p>nation."  Support for a constituent assembly is a reversal of </p><p>previous party positions, which called for establishing an </p><p>all-party government under Article 128 of the Constitution. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Nepal Peasants and Workers Party (NPWP):  Least </p><p>optimistic of all the major party spokesmen, the NPWP </p><p>President Narayan Man Bijuchhe predicts that the talks will </p><p>bog down and fail.  Further, he believes that the call for </p><p>talks is a ruse by the Maoists and/or the government to stage </p><p>for future attacks.  Should the talks be successful and a </p><p>constituent assembly be held, he stated that the Maoists can </p><p>be expected to serve the Indian agenda as a means of thanking </p><p>them for providing years of safehaven. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) People\'s Front Nepal (PFN):  Amik Sherchan, </p><p>President of the PFN, took the cease-fire announcement </p><p>positively, as it has opened the door for talks.  However, he </p><p>too went on to complain that the government did not consult </p><p>the political parties regarding this matter.  It is his </p><p>belief that the opportunity for a peaceful resolution to the </p><p>conflict may be squandered if the government continues to </p><p>sideline the political parties.  Serchan stressed that it </p><p>would take some time for the Maoists to accept a </p><p>constitutional monarchy.  He raised further concerns about </p><p>Narayan Singh Pun\'s credentials as the government\'s </p><p>coordinator; he believes it will only be a matter of time </p><p>before Pun is named the delegation\'s head. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Unknown Implications </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The GoN is evaluating the full implications of a </p><p>cease-fire. Comments to PolOff by MG Katwal, Co-coordinator </p><p>of the National Security Secretariat, indicate his desire to </p><p>continue security force patrols and presence in the field. He </p><p>confided, however, that a code of conduct has not yet been </p><p>established. MG Katwal could also not determine if the </p><p>cease-fire will mean a withdrawal of the Maoists\' February 13 </p><p>and 14 general strike. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>The Palace Extends Its Thanks </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Palace\'s Press Secretary, Mohan Pandey, called to </p><p>thank the Ambassador for the U.S. Government\'s support and </p><p>pressure on the Maoists, which he believes played a </p><p>significant role in in influencing Maoist agreement to the </p><p>ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The political parties\' initial comments--cautious </p><p>optimism laced with criticism--indicate that they may be </p><p>trying to hedge their bets in the face of uncertain outcomes. </p><p> The parties, which already fear being marginalized, will </p><p>likely press for greater "transparency" in dialogue efforts </p><p>as a way to keep open opportunities to comment on the process </p><p>without having to take responsibility for its success or </p><p>failure.  The GON realizes the importance of multi-partisan </p><p>support for this initiative (Refs A and B); failure to get </p><p>the parties on board will only leave the Maoists a possible </p><p>"out" to renege on any commitments made through negotiations. </p><p> Party strategies will become clearer after the release of </p><p>public statements expected in the next few days.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Maoist Press Statement </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Begin Translation: </p><p>It is well understood that our party is always ready for the </p><p>positive and progressive solution to the present civil war in </p><p>the country. We have been publicizing our minimum conditions </p><p>to make an environment for the talks. In this connection, </p><p>yesterday we were informed about the Government\'s decision </p><p>that to start the peace talks the previous government\'s </p><p>decision of declaring the Maoists as terrorists has been </p><p>revoked, the red corner notices issued against the Maoist\'s </p><p>leaders has been withdrawn, the government\'s decision of </p><p>fixing price tags on the heads of top Maoist leaders has been </p><p>withdrawn, and the decision for a cease-fire has been made. </p><p>This decision of the ruling party is taken positively by our </p><p>party and through this press release we declare a cease-fire </p><p>and willingly participate in the peace talks process. Like </p><p>always, the party appeals to the entire revolutionary </p><p>warriors of the liberation army, authorities of the people\'s </p><p>power, and the general public to work according to the </p><p>declaration. The party also appeals for the continuation of </p><p>the organizational and peaceful mobilization to move forward </p><p>in favor of general policy of the party and minimum working </p><p>plan--round table conference, interim government, and </p><p>constitutional assembly. </p><p>Date: 29 Jan 2003 </p><p>Prachanda </p><p>Central Committee </p><p>NCP (Maoist) </p><p>End Translation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Government Press Statement </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Begin Translation: </p><p>A) His Majesty\'s Government has the policy to resolve the </p><p>Maoist problem through talks, and the CPN (Maoist) has also </p><p>taken initiative in this regard, and since both the sides </p><p>have reached an understanding for a cease-fire, the earlier </p><p>deicision of labeling the CPN (Maoists) as terrorists, red </p><p>corner notice to arrest them, and cash rewaqrds to anyone </p><p>informing or helping in arresting the Maoist leaders, as </p><p>called by some quarters as "prices on their heads" have been </p><p>scrapped. </p><p>B) To create an atmosphere for the political solution of the </p><p>problem, Mr. Narayan Singh Pun has been designated as the </p><p>coordinator. </p><p>Cabinet Secretariat </p><p>January 29, 2003 </p><p>End Translation. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
