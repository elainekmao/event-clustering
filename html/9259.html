RANGOON 769 </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 574 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The input on pending U.S. sanctions on </p><p>Burma continues to roll in.  In the last several days we\'ve </p><p>heard the fears and concerns of the largest U.S. investor in </p><p>Burma, Unocal, and also from 28,000 garment workers.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>Unocal Sees Unintended Consequences </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Chief of Mission met with a local Unocal </p><p>representative on June 25 to hear the largest U.S. investor </p><p>in Burma\'s concerns over the intended, and possible </p><p>unintended, consequences of the proposed new Burma sanctions. </p><p> Unocal was most concerned that the remittance and travel </p><p>bans, if applied without any exceptions for pre-existing </p><p>business operations, could lead to an untenable operating </p><p>situation for the energy company.  The Unocal rep hinted that </p><p>these sanctions could force the company to reconsider its </p><p>investment stake in Burma if it were not grandfathered. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The unintended negative consequences of a Unocal </p><p>divestment would be at least three-fold.  First, the company </p><p>would have to sell out to another energy firm -- many of </p><p>whom, including China\'s national oil company, are snooping </p><p>around looking to farm into an existing development -- paying </p><p>a 40 percent Burmese capital gains tax on the sale directly </p><p>into the regime\'s coffers.  Though the Unocal official could </p><p>not offhand tell us how much the gains would likely be, or in </p><p>what form the payment would be made, he made it clear that </p><p>this would be pure profit for the Burmese government. </p><p>Second, of the likely new investors, except for current </p><p>partner Total, none would put up the amount of money </p><p>currently spent by Unocal for social and economic development </p><p>in its pipeline zone (see Ref B).  Third, there is the </p><p>prospect of Chinese influence over a large portion of </p><p>Thailand\'s natural gas imports if the Chinese national oil </p><p>company took over Unocal\'s position. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Perhaps a bit prematurely, the Unocal official also </p><p>told us the firm\'s concerns about sanctions not yet under </p><p>consideration.  He said any expansion of a trade ban to </p><p>include U.S. exports to Burma would be extremely damaging to </p><p>Unocal\'s platform and pipeline operations.  Several key parts </p><p>are imported from the United States, and not easily </p><p>substituted.  If one of these parts went down, and importing </p><p>a replacement was illegal, the pipeline, which carries </p><p>significant volumes of natural gas to Thailand, might have to </p><p>slow or stop its operations temporarily.  The result of this, </p><p>the rep explained, would be "the lights going out in parts of </p><p>Bangkok." </p><p> </p><p>Garment Workers Speak Out </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) We were visited on July 3rd by a delegation from the </p><p>Burmese Garment Manufacturers Association (GMA) and the Union </p><p>of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry </p><p>(UMFCCI).  The delegation presented a letter to President </p><p>Bush urging him to veto the proposed import ban legislation </p><p>(faxed to EAP/BCLTV).  Attached to this letter were two large </p><p>boxes filled with petitions, signed by 28,000 garment workers </p><p>from factories in the Rangoon area.  Apparently the GMA went </p><p>to its members and asked them to explain to their workers the </p><p>likely impact of import ban legislation on their livelihood. </p><p>After this the petitions were made available for signature. </p><p>The delegation assured us that this was done on a totally </p><p>voluntary basis, with no coercion.  Though there\'s no way to </p><p>verify this, there\'s no reason to believe that any force </p><p>would be needed to get the signatures. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) We agreed to forward the letter to Washington and </p><p>keep the GMA apprised of the progress of the legislation. </p><p>However, we also urged the GMA and UMFCCI to use their </p><p>lobbying and organizing ability to bring the message to the </p><p>SPDC that only political change could turn the tide for their </p><p>factories and workers.  The delegation laughed and said </p><p>simply, "Not possible." </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
