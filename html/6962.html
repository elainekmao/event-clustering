(SBU) For the seventh day in a row, no new cases of SARS were </p><p>reported in Vietnam by noon on March 31, possibly indicating that </p><p>the outbreak is well-controlled.  In Vietnam, WHO experts believe </p><p>that rapid detection of the outbreak and immediate introduction </p><p>of infection control procedures may have held further </p><p>transmission at bay.  According to CDC here, health officials are </p><p>still surveying closely because of travelers coming in from Hong </p><p>Kong, Singapore, and Guangdong, China. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Three patients remain in the French Hospital; one is </p><p>seriously ill and two are improving.  23 patients are in the </p><p>Tropical Medicine Institute of Bach Mai Hospital.  The cumulative </p><p>total stands at 58 cases of SARS including 4 deaths and 23 </p><p>discharged patients.  Discharged patients are released according </p><p>to WHO /Ministry of Health guideline policies.  All patients and </p><p>their contacts are carefully monitored. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The French DCM told us today that Paris suddenly </p><p>changed its mind on evacuating several SARS patients from the </p><p>French Hospital to France over the weekend.  A French military </p><p>aircraft had been scheduled to arrive on March 28 to transport </p><p>the patients, but was cancelled at the last minute.  Instead, </p><p>France has sent a nine person medical team from the defense </p><p>health services to work with the three remaining patients at the </p><p>hospital.  According to the French DCM, the decontamination of </p><p>the hospital will begin shortly and will work "around" the three </p><p>remaining patients.  Although the private hospital has not yet </p><p>found the necessary financing to reopen, the French DCM noted </p><p>that it had been deemed worthy of public support in the form of a </p><p>French military medical team.  She was cautiously optimistic that </p><p>partial public funding might be found. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) WHO infectious disease specialist in Hanoi, Dr. Carlo </p><p>Urbani, who died of SARS on March 29 in Thailand, was the first </p><p>doctor to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS. </p><p>According to the UNDP, his report, which includes the incubation </p><p>period of this new disease, remains valid and still provides much </p><p>of our understanding of SARS. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
