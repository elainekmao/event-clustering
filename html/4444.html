This cable summarizes the major findings on the food </p><p>security situation in Matebeleland North Province from a </p><p>recent field visit conducted to the area by a joint USAID </p><p>Food for Peace, Famine Early Warning Service Network </p><p>(FEWS NET) and World Food Programme (WFP) team. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PURPOSE OF VISIT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. The purpose of the visit was to conduct a rapid </p><p>appraisal of the food security situation in Binga and </p><p>Insiza districts of Matebeleland province, and to provide </p><p>guidance to the Regional Food for Peace Officer (FFPO) </p><p>visiting Matebeleland province on a mission to </p><p>investigate the politicization of food aid in the </p><p>province (see reftel A for sep-FFPO report on this latter </p><p>subject). </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>METHODOLOGY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3. The trip was conducted over the period 7-9 November </p><p>2002.  Findings presented in this report are based on a </p><p>rapid appraisal of food markets in Bulawayo City and </p><p>Lupane, Hwange and Binga Districts in Matebeleland North </p><p>Province.  Personal observations were complemented by </p><p>interviews with representatives from WFP in Matebeleland, </p><p>World Vision (WV), Organization for Rural Areas Progress </p><p>(ORAP), and Dabane Trust (the last two local NGOs), as </p><p>well as the District Administrator for Binga, the Binga </p><p>Co-coordinator for the Catholic Archdiocese Ecumenical </p><p>Commission (CADEC, the Zimbabwe equivalent of CARITAS), </p><p>and villagers from Lupane, Hwange and Binga Districts. </p><p>Note:  Following preliminary discussions, Insiza was </p><p>dropped from the visit itinerary due to security concerns </p><p>related to the continuing sensitivity of the situation in </p><p>that district (see reftel A for more on this subject). </p><p>End Note. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>FOOD SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. The food security situation continues to worsen, both </p><p>in the provincial capital (Bulawayo) and in the rural </p><p>areas of Matebeleland.  Food access is seriously limited </p><p>by the run-away inflation - estimated at 144% as the end </p><p>of October 2002, suppressed incomes and the ever- </p><p>increasing levels of unemployment.  Incomes of poor urban </p><p>households are trailing way behind inflation.  Recent </p><p>salary reviews for unskilled and the semi-skilled workers </p><p>saw their salaries increase to between ZD13,000 and </p><p>ZD24,000 per month - between one-third and two-thirds </p><p>less than the October 2002 Consumer Council of Zimbabwe </p><p>recommended minimum expenditure basket for an average Low- </p><p>Income-Urban household.  The staple food maize meal and </p><p>maize grain are not readily available in the shops, but </p><p>are occasionally available on the parallel market at more </p><p>than six times the controlled price.  Bread, until </p><p>recently the main substitute for maize meal (along with </p><p>Irish potatoes and rice), is selling for twice its </p><p>controlled price, and is in seriously short supply. </p><p> </p><p>5. Prices of Selected Basic Goods as at 8 November 2002: </p><p> </p><p>   -------------  ------  ---------- -------  -------- </p><p>   Food Item      Unit    Controlled Prices   Prices in </p><p>                             Price      in     Bulawayo </p><p>                                      Binga     City </p><p>                                      Town </p><p>                             (ZW$)    (ZW$)     (ZW$) </p><p>   -------------  ------  ---------- -------  -------- </p><p>        Bread      Loaf      60.44     160     130 </p><p>   Sugar           2kg      114.70     300     200 </p><p>   Irish potatoes  15kg         Na    3000    3000 </p><p>   Rice            2kg          Na    1075     800 </p><p>   Cooking oil     750ml    114.70     700     700 </p><p> </p><p>6. The majority of rural households in Matebeleland North </p><p>did not have any meaningful harvest from the 2000/2001 or </p><p>2001/2002 production years.  As a result, they have been </p><p>dependent on food aid and/or the market for the last two </p><p>marketing seasons.  WFP is currently feeding between 40 </p><p>and 70% of the people in five out of six districts of </p><p>Matebeleland North Province.  In Binga, the only district </p><p>in which WFP is not currently operating, CADEC and some </p><p>church groups were undertaking feeding operations.  Save </p><p>the Children - UK (SCF-UK) was active in providing </p><p>assistance in Binga until they were stopped by </p><p>Government, following accusations of supporting the </p><p>opposition in the September local government elections. </p><p>Note:  SCF-UK has just received final approval from the </p><p>GOZ this week to resume their humanitarian assistance </p><p>activities in this district.  They expect to resume </p><p>feeding programs there soon.  End Note.  WFP, through </p><p>their NGO implementing partners in this Province, ORAP </p><p>and World Vision, supplies about 2,000 MT per month of </p><p>food aid in each of the districts in which they are </p><p>operating. </p><p> </p><p>7. Government, through the Grain Marketing Board (GMB), </p><p>supplies about 1,000 MT of food to each district per </p><p>month.  The food is sold to local communities at around </p><p>$10.20/kg, down from ZW$19/kg in May 2002, at </p><p>distribution points established throughout the rural </p><p>areas.  Maize deliveries by GMB to the communities are </p><p>very erratic in all of the districts of Matebeleland </p><p>North.  Households wait for between two to three months </p><p>to get maize sufficient for only two to three weeks\' </p><p>needs.  The main reasons for the irregular maize supply </p><p>are reported to be limited stocks from the supply depots </p><p>in Bulawayo, and inadequate transport to move available </p><p>grain from Bulawayo to district depots and, in turn, to </p><p>the selling points within the districts.  Transporters </p><p>are not comfortable with the generally poor road network. </p><p>In the case of Binga, transporters find the route from </p><p>Bulawayo too long and dangerous, particularly the section </p><p>that goes through Kamativi Mines which has sharp curves </p><p>and steep slopes.  In addition, the strip road to Nkayi </p><p>is accused of tearing tires apart with its deteriorating </p><p>shoulders. </p><p> </p><p>8. To address the access side of food security, </p><p>government is operating a cash-for-labor programme, </p><p>parallel to the food sales programme, in which community </p><p>members undertake some work in infrastructure development </p><p>and repair to receive between ZD500 and ZD1,500 per </p><p>person per month for the work. </p><p> </p><p>9. Poor management of GMB maize has allowed some </p><p>unscrupulous villagers with cash to buy more food than </p><p>they need which is being smuggled across the Zambezi </p><p>River for sale in Zambia for hefty profits.  For example, </p><p>it was reported that a 50kg bag of maize bought for about </p><p>ZD510 can be sold for up to ZD3,000 in Zambia.  Binga </p><p>residents complain that, in addition to maize grain and </p><p>meal, sugar, fuel and other basic items are also being </p><p>smuggled into Zambia.  In addition, although illegal, </p><p>limited maize grain sales by some private dealers are </p><p>reported to be occurring throughout this Province. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>COPING STRATEGIES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. To deal with the food shortages, rural communities are </p><p>employing a variety of different coping strategies. </p><p>Reported strategies include reducing the number of meals </p><p>per day (while reductions to one meal per day were most </p><p>common, some households are reportedly skipping meals for </p><p>an entire day), feeding on leaf vegetables (kale, rape, </p><p>chomolia, etc.), and collecting/eating wild fruits </p><p>(baobab, utsiga) and vegetables (utende).  Some </p><p>households share the limited grain or maize meal that </p><p>they receive as food assistance or buy from GMB with </p><p>relatives and friends who have run out of stocks. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE 2002/2003 PRODUCTION SEASON </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>10. Like the greater part of the country (see reftel B), </p><p>Binga, Lupane and Hwange Districts have received adequate </p><p>rains to date, and farmers have started planting this </p><p>season\'s crops.  Smallholder farmers in the three </p><p>districts visited have limited stocks of sorghum and </p><p>millet seed available to plant this year.  There is no </p><p>maize seed on the market.  As a result, farmers are </p><p>resorting to planting some of the maize grain they have </p><p>received as food aid or bought from the GMB for food. </p><p>Input support schemes run by government, NGOs and church </p><p>organizations are attempting to address the seed </p><p>availability and access constraints that are spread </p><p>throughout the Province (and indeed the entire country - </p><p>reftel B). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. The team\'s findings support the increasing gravity of </p><p>the deteriorating food security situation in this region </p><p>of the country.  While the situation is indeed grim, it </p><p>remains difficult to assess accurately due to the paucity </p><p>of available/systematic data on the nutritional status of </p><p>the affected populations.  More effort needs to be </p><p>devoted to national nutritional surveillance in Zimbabwe, </p><p>on an urgent basis, to address this situation and guide </p><p>future relief efforts over the coming critical "hungry </p><p>season" months.  The preliminary findings on preparations </p><p>for the 2002/03 agricultural season appear to support </p><p>similarly dire predictions for greater country at large </p><p>(reftel A).  Although it remains too early for any </p><p>accurate projections, this initial anecdotal evidence </p><p>bodes extremely ill for this chronically poor, rainfall </p><p>deficit and highly food insecure region of the country. </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
