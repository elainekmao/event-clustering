(SBU)  As predicted (Ref A), supporters of Prime Minister </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba have called a General Convention of the </p><p>Nepali Congress Party with the aim of deposing Party </p><p>President and former PM Girija Prasad Koirala from his post. </p><p>The motion to oust Koirala from the party leadership is </p><p>expected late the evening of June 18.  If carried, the motion </p><p>will almost certainly provoke counter-challenges from the </p><p>Koirala camp before the Election Commission and the Supreme </p><p>Court.  Chronic intra-party strife threatens to continue to </p><p>divert the nation\'s leadership from more important </p><p>problems--such as the Maoist insurgency--afflicting the </p><p>country.  A split in the party is also likely to offer new </p><p>opportunities to the Congress\' rivals, including the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist, the </p><p>largest Opposition party.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>PARTY GENERAL CONVENTION CONVENES </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  After efforts to reconcile the two warring factions </p><p>of the Nepali Congress Party proved fruitless, supporters of </p><p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba called a General Convention </p><p>of the Nepali Congress Party membership in the capital June </p><p>17-18 with the aim of deposing Party President and former PM </p><p>Girija Prasad Koirala from his post.  The Convention caps a </p><p>series of strikes and counter-strikes--including Deuba\'s </p><p>expulsion from the party--in the ongoing power struggle </p><p>between the two leaders (Reftels).  One delegate told the </p><p>Ambassador June 17 that 800 bona fide Convention members (out </p><p>of a total of 1,465) participated in the closed session the </p><p>first day.  One local press report put the number of </p><p>attendees at 900.  A 51 percent majority of Convention </p><p>members\' votes is needed in order to amend the party </p><p>Constitution, while a two-thirds majority is needed to depose </p><p>the President. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  According to Karna Malla, PM Deuba\'s personal </p><p>assistant, delegates at the second session the late afternoon </p><p>of June 18 were voting on amendments to the party </p><p>Constitution--including, most likely, the stipulation of a </p><p>two-thirds majority to oust the President.  Once the </p><p>amendments are accepted into the Constitution, a vote to </p><p>depose the President will follow on the late evening of June </p><p>18, Malla predicted.  As of COB June 18, the delegates </p><p>remained closeted. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>CONVENTION ILLEGAL, CLAIMS KOIRALA CAMP </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Also as expected, supporters of aging Party </p><p>President G.P. Koirala are rejecting the Convention as </p><p>illegal.  Party General Secretary Sushil Koirala (who was </p><p>holding his own meeting with a rival group of party members </p><p>when we talked to him June 18) claimed that the attendees do </p><p>not hold valid credentials and noted that Koirala supporters </p><p>are boycotting the sessions.  Deuba cannot call a General </p><p>Convention now that he has been expelled from the party </p><p>membership (Ref A).  Should Deuba admit his mistake in </p><p>dissolving Parliament, however, his expulsion might be </p><p>reconsidered, Koirala explained.  He added that he questions </p><p>the attendance tallies reported in the daily press, asserting </p><p>that no more than 400 members are attending the Convention. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  If Convention members proceed as expected with </p><p>amending the Party Constitution to oust Koirala as Nepali </p><p>Congress President, it could trigger a tendentious legal </p><p>battle--played out first before the Election Commission Court </p><p>and then, most likely, before the Supreme Court--as the two </p><p>factions fight for the right to use the name, symbol, flag, </p><p>and other assorted paraphernalia of Nepal\'s oldest and </p><p>largest party in the November 13 elections.  (One historical </p><p>note:  The Supreme Court heard a similar case in 1994, after </p><p>the Election Commission refused to allow Baburam Bhattarai\'s </p><p>faction of the United People\'s Front to register for </p><p>elections.  Although Bhattarai\'s faction won before the </p><p>Supreme Court, he refused to participate in the elections and </p><p>went underground, re-emerging two years later to head the </p><p>Maoist insurgency.)  Whatever the outcome of the legal </p><p>contest, it is unlikely to matter to the country\'s voters as </p><p>much as the fact that such protracted, self-interested </p><p>intra-party squabbling continues to divert the leadership\'s </p><p>attention from addressing far more significant issues--such </p><p>as the Maoist insurgency--directly affecting their </p><p>constituents.  Regardless of who prevails in court, this most </p><p>recent Congress controversy can only further tarnish that </p><p>proud old party\'s public image, thereby offering fresh </p><p>opportunities to other contenders, including the Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist, in the upcoming </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>4. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
