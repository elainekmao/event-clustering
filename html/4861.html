RANGOON 1585 </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 1571 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM RONALD MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  International NGOs (INGOs) are working </p><p>well in Kachin State.  Though few in number, they are </p><p>providing urgently needed programs for HIV/AIDS, malaria, </p><p>tuberculosis, and rural health care.  There are some types of </p><p>aid programs, and geographic regions, that remain out of </p><p>reach for the INGOs.  However, if the INGOs\' good relations </p><p>with local officials persist, additional progress is likely. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>HIV/AIDS:  Good News and Bad News </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) INGOs in Kachin State (Burma\'s northernmost state, </p><p>with a population of about 1.2 million) are focusing almost </p><p>exclusively on health care -- testing, basic provision, and </p><p>education.  On the HIV/AIDS front, there is some good and bad </p><p>news.  On the positive side, the INGOs working most directly </p><p>on HIV/AIDS agree that there is increasing acceptance and </p><p>usage of condoms by sex workers.  Furthermore, pimps are in </p><p>many cases now taking the side of the sex workers in trying </p><p>to convince clients to use condoms. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Despite these positive indicators, INGOs report that </p><p>sex workers are still willing to go without condoms if the </p><p>money is better or if the sex worker "like" the client. </p><p>Also, because of the combination locally of very high poverty </p><p>and a small class of very wealthy Burmese and Chinese </p><p>business people, the population of sex workers in Kachin </p><p>State is growing as quickly as in Rangoon.  HIV infection </p><p>rates are also very high among sex workers.  One INGO </p><p>estimated a HIV infection rate of around 50 percent among a </p><p>population of sex workers in a local disco. </p><p> </p><p>TB: Cases Up, But So Is Treatment </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On the tuberculosis front, there also seems to be a </p><p>mixed bag.  One INGO that is active with TB testing and </p><p>treatment says that it is finding more cases of TB, but that </p><p>more and more people are coming in for testing and treatment. </p><p> The problem of TB is compounded, INGOs agree, by the </p><p>slumping economy as many people do not have enough to eat, </p><p>and are thus more susceptible to TB (and other debilitating </p><p>diseases) and slower to recover. </p><p> </p><p>Good Cooperation with the Authorities -- So Far </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) INGOs report that relations are good with local </p><p>government authorities in Kachin State.  The local health </p><p>director has given tacit permission for NGOs to provide </p><p>services that the government is supposed to be providing, but </p><p>does not (for example TB testing and treatment).  Usually, </p><p>local health officials are frightened of taking any </p><p>initiative to allow NGOs to provide any parallel services </p><p>(even if the government in fact is not providing these </p><p>services).  Relations are also good with the Northern </p><p>Military Command\'s chief medical officer (who apparently </p><p>speaks English quite well and is a fan of the BBC).  However, </p><p>the military has not allowed INGOs access to the military </p><p>hospital in town. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A true test of the local authorities\' willingness to </p><p>let the INGOs provide essential services will come in the </p><p>area of intravenous drug use (IDU) intervention.  This is a </p><p>very sensitive proposition in Burma, with needle exchange and </p><p>substitution programs still illegal.  In Kachin State, one </p><p>INGO operates a very unofficial and subterranean needle </p><p>exchange program in Mogaung (about 50 miles from Myitkyina), </p><p>which relies on the local police turning a blind eye.  The </p><p>INGO is trying to start a similar exchange program in </p><p>Myitkyina, but is facing more police scrutiny.  There is </p><p>clearly much potential, and need, for an expansion of harm </p><p>reduction in the Myitkyina area, but there must be </p><p>significant discussion beforehand with the various local </p><p>authorities. </p><p> </p><p>Neediest are out of Reach </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Despite the successes and access they have had, the </p><p>INGOs agree that the remotest 25 percent of the state (along </p><p>the border areas controlled by Kachin cease-fire groups) has </p><p>the most urgent need for humanitarian assistance.  However, </p><p>these regions are still mostly out of their reach.  Of the </p><p>INGOs, World Concern seems to have the best access to the </p><p>remoter areas.  However, funding problems have forced it to </p><p>scale back its operations.  Some of Kachin State\'s indigenous </p><p>NGOs may also be getting to these areas, but not to provide </p><p>health care services.  There are also rumors that </p><p>church-based NGOs operating in China,s Yunnan Province </p><p>occasionally cross the border to provide some services (of an </p><p>undetermined nature) in neighboring Kachin villages. </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Kachin State would be an excellent laboratory for </p><p>any expansion of U.S. humanitarian aid programs -- especially </p><p>for building the capacity of local NGOs.  The INGOs in place </p><p>are well-established, have clear and reasonable objectives, </p><p>and have good working relations with the necessary </p><p>authorities (without relying upon them).  Likewise, the local </p><p>NGOs in Kachin State, unlike their cousins in Rangoon, seem </p><p>to be comparatively independent of government control and </p><p>influence.  Part of this is certainly the result of the </p><p>current personalities in key government positions in Kachin </p><p>State.  Another important factor is the relative unity of the </p><p>Kachin people, and their leaders\' so far successful balancing </p><p>act of keeping good personal relations with the government, </p><p>while retaining a relatively independent program of community </p><p>development.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
