<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001790 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>NEW DELHI PLS PASS TO AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-26-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, MOPS, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Peace process update: Report of tensions in </p><p>military; Tiger cadre movement; Cricket\'s healing powers </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1787, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C/NF) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process </p><p>reviews the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Reported tensions in military toward government\'s </p><p>peace initiative </p><p> </p><p>-- President muted in public re peace process </p><p> </p><p>-- Largest Tamil Tiger cadre movement to date goes </p><p>smoothly, according to monitors </p><p> </p><p>-- The flavor of the peace process:  Sri Lankans of all </p><p>stripes embrace major international cricket tournament </p><p>now taking place in Colombo </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>Report of Tensions in Military </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) Mission has picked up its first indication of </p><p>possible tensions within the military toward the peace </p><p>process.  In a September 25 meeting with RSO, Nimal </p><p>Goonetilleke, the head of the Police Special Task Force </p><p>(STF) (please protect), related that he had heard that </p><p>five or six high-ranking military officers (NFI) were </p><p>actively speaking out against the peace process within </p><p>their respective commands.  Goonetilleke speculated that </p><p>some of these officers might be angry because the peace </p><p>process was beginning to undermine illicit activities </p><p>they were engaged in.  The GSL had heard of these </p><p>murmurs, he continued, which was the genesis of public </p><p>remarks the Prime Minister made September 21 to the </p><p>effect that he would not tolerate "divided loyalties" </p><p>within government ranks.  When asked, Goonetilleke </p><p>replied that he had no information that anyone in the </p><p>military was planning to take any sort of action against </p><p>the GSL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) Comment:  Goonetilleke is usually a solid </p><p>source, though we have not picked up collaborating </p><p>information re his report.  Given how fast the peace </p><p>process has moved, it is not surprising that some in the </p><p>military may be disillusioned, perhaps feeling that they </p><p>are being abandoned after a valiant effort defending the </p><p>country (or -- more cynically -- that they are losing </p><p>out on their illicit perks gained by wartime </p><p>exigencies).  For its part, the government has tried to </p><p>do its best to ensure that the military remains on board </p><p>by keeping it fully briefed on the peace process and by </p><p>maintaining benefits to the extent the GSL\'s difficult </p><p>financial circumstances allow.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>President Muted re Peace Process </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) President Kumaratunga has taken a muffled public </p><p>approach re the peace process in the aftermath of the </p><p>successful conclusion of the recent talks in Thailand. </p><p>In general, her relatively few public comments re the </p><p>talks have basically struck positive tones.  According </p><p>to contacts, however, one matter that appears to have </p><p>gotten under the President\'s skin is that no one in the </p><p>government has offered to personally brief her on the </p><p>results of the talks.  (Note: Harim Peiris, a </p><p>presidential spokesman, told us late September 26 that </p><p>he had heard that the government might be trying to </p><p>arrange some sort of briefing, but he had no </p><p>confirmation.) </p><p>5.  (SBU) (((Note:  Kumaratunga\'s general lack of public </p><p>comment on the peace process contrasts with a series of </p><p>recent speeches she has given re domestic issues.  In </p><p>these speeches, usually given before cheering party </p><p>members, she has harshly lashed out at the GSL re its </p><p>plans to move forward with a bill that would amend the </p><p>executive\'s powers to call new elections.  In one widely </p><p>reported speech on this issue, Kumaratunga was quoted as </p><p>stating, "They are trying to clip the wings of the </p><p>president.  I will use my powers.  I will not die like a </p><p>kitten."))) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment:  Kumaratunga has been alternately hot- </p><p>and-cold re this iteration of the peace process since </p><p>its inception.  At times, she has vociferously </p><p>criticized the government\'s handling of the issue.  At </p><p>other times, she has assumed an almost proprietary air </p><p>by underscoring the fact that the current process has </p><p>roots in moves she took when she first came to power in </p><p>1994-95.  The fact that she is relatively muted on the </p><p>subject now may indicate that she just does not see </p><p>making much political mileage by commenting on the peace </p><p>process at this point.  Reports that she has not yet </p><p>been offered a briefing re the Thai talks are </p><p>disturbing, as it is the sort of slight that only </p><p>increases "cohabitation" tensions.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Large LTTE Cadre Movement goes smoothly </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Under the auspices of the February ceasefire </p><p>accord, the LTTE has made a major troop movement. </p><p>Pierre Elderson, a Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) </p><p>official, has confirmed that 265 LTTE cadre went by </p><p>vehicle from Batticaloa in the east to Omanthai, a LTTE- </p><p>controlled border town in the north-central part of the </p><p>country on September 23.  The movement was monitored by </p><p>SLMM observers and tracked by the Sri Lankan military. </p><p>Elderson reported that the movement went smoothly with </p><p>no problems reported.  He added that 210 of the cadre </p><p>were female and 55 male.  Originally slated to be a sea </p><p>movement, bad weather offshore necessitated that it be </p><p>by land. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment:  There have been a number of cadre </p><p>movements so far, but this is the largest to date.  The </p><p>fact that it went so smoothly is a testament to how well </p><p>the ceasefire accord and related GSL-LTTE understandings </p><p>are being implemented.  The SLMM showed great skill in </p><p>arranging the movement, which we understand took hours </p><p>of laborious mediation.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>Cricket\'s Healing Powers </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Sri Lankans are avidly embracing a major </p><p>international cricket tourney now taking place in </p><p>Colombo.  The three-week tournament sponsored by the </p><p>International Cricket Council is the second most </p><p>important in cricket, ranking just after the World Cup. </p><p>All of the best international cricket teams have been </p><p>participating, including Australia, India, Pakistan, and </p><p>the popular local team.  Large crowds have flocked to </p><p>the matches and the TV audience, including in the war- </p><p>ravaged north and east, is said to be huge.  The fact </p><p>that the Sri Lankan team has done quite well has also </p><p>helped ratings, no doubt.  The country is expected to </p><p>come to a standstill when Sri Lanka plays defending </p><p>world champion Australia on September 27. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Comment:  The fact that a major cricket </p><p>tournament is taking place in Sri Lanka at all is a </p><p>pleasant surprise to many here.  Sri Lankans had grown </p><p>used to their cricket-mad country being overlooked as a </p><p>host for major events because of the conflict and the </p><p>danger of terrorism.  Big events can now take place in </p><p>Sri Lanka due to the peace process, however, and Sri </p><p>Lankans of all ethnic stripes appreciate that.  Indeed, </p><p>for Sri Lankans the news only gets better:  a major test </p><p>match between the Australian and Pakistani teams had to </p><p>be moved from Pakistan because of tensions there.  The </p><p>new site:  Sri Lanka.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
