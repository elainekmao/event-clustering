<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 000500 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1/19/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: LATEST MASSACRE PART OF ON-GOING PARA OFFENSIVE </p><p>AGAINST FARC ON CARIBBEAN COAST </p><p> </p><p>1. CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON. REASONS: </p><p>1.5(C,D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: ON JANUARY 17, SOME 26 RESIDENTS OF A </p><p>COMMUNITY NEAR THE TOWN OF OVEJAS IN NORTHERN SUCRE </p><p>DEPARTMENT WERE MASSACRED, APPARENTLY BY PARAMILITARIES </p><p>BELONGING TO THE NORTHERN BLOCK OF SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS </p><p>OPERATING ON THE ATLANTIC COAST OF COLOMBIA.  A THIRD OF </p><p>THE COMMUNITY HOUSES WERE BURNED DOWN AND MOST OF ITS </p><p>RESIDENTS FLED TO OVEJAS.  ONE EMBASSY INTERLOCUTOR SAID </p><p>"THE COMMUNITY IS NOW VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT."  ACCORDING </p><p>TO A COLOMBIAN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE CONTACT, THE PARA ATTACK </p><p>IS PART OF AN ON-GOING CAMPAIGN TO DISLODGE THE FARC 37TH </p><p>FRONT FROM THE STRATEGIC MONTES DE MARIA MOUNTAIN RANGE </p><p>AND TO PUSH THE FARC OUT OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC COAST.  THE </p><p>PARA ATTACKS/MASSACRES AGAINST CIVILIAN POPULATIONS ARE </p><p>LIKELY TO CONTINUE, ESPECIALLY IN SUCRE.  THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>NAVY\'S MARINE CORPS HAS LAUNCHED A MAJOR OPERATION TO </p><p>SURROUND THE AREA OF THE MASSACRE AND TRY TO CAPTURE THE </p><p>CULPRITS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ON JANUARY 17, SOME 26 RESIDENTS OF A SMALL </p><p>COMMUNITY KNOWN AS CHENGUE NEAR THE TOWN OF OVEJAS IN </p><p>NORTHERN SUCRE DEPARTMENT WERE MASSACRED, APPARENTLY BY </p><p>THE CENTAURO (NORTHERN) BLOCK OF SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS </p><p>OPERATING IN AND AROUND THE ATLANTIC COAST OF COLOMBIA. </p><p>THE CENTAURO BLOCK IS REPORTEDLY LED BY RODRIGO ANTONIO </p><p>MERCADO, ALIAS "CADENA," A CLOSE AFFILIATE OF UNITED SELF- </p><p>DEFENSE FORCES OF COLOMBIA (AUC) LEADER CARLOS CASTANO. </p><p>ON JANUARY 19, CASTANO CONDEMNED THE MASSACRE AND DENIED </p><p>HIS INVOLVEMENT, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HIS NORTHERN FRONT </p><p>HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE AND THAT THEY HAD "GONE OVERBOARD." </p><p>THE MASSACRE FOLLOWS A STRING OF PARAMILITARY MASSACRES </p><p>ON/ALONG ATLANTIC COASTAL AREAS DATING BACK TO THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 16, 1999 MASSACRE OF 28 RESIDENTS OF EL SALADO IN </p><p>NORTHERN BOLIVAR DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) POLICE AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE PUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED </p><p>THE EVER-INCREASING NUMBER OF MASSACRES ALONG THE ATLANTIC </p><p>COAST TO AN ATTEMPT BY THE SELF-DEFENSE FORCES TO: (A) </p><p>"CLEANSE" THE NORTHERN AREAS OF SUCRE, BOLIVAR, ATLANTICO, </p><p>MAGDALENA, AND CESAR DEPARTMENTS OF THE FARC, MUCH AS THEY </p><p>HAVE ALREADY DONE IN CORDOBA DEPARTMENT, (B) CONTROL THE </p><p>NORTH COAST, INCLUDING THE MORROSQUILLO GULF IN SUCRE AND </p><p>OTHER KEY SMALL PORTS, TO EXERCISE A MONOPOLY OVER ENTRY </p><p>OF ARMS AND PRECURSORS AND EXIT OF COCAINE, AND, (C) </p><p>SPECIFICALLY IN AND AROUND SUCRE AND BOLIVAR DEPARTMENTS, </p><p>DISLODGE THE FARC\'S 35TH AND 37TH FRONTS FROM THE RICH </p><p>CATTLE AND AGRICULTURAL REGION SURROUNDING THE MONTES DE </p><p>MARIA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DURING A JANUARY 18 BRIEFING, A HIGH RANKING </p><p>COLOMBIAN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE CONTACT TOLD POLOFF THAT </p><p>CHENGUE WAS A MILITARY TARGET FOR THE PARAS BECAUSE IT </p><p>SERVED AS AN ENTRY POINT INTO THE MONTES DE MARIA, WHERE </p><p>THE FARC 37TH FRONT OPERATES, AND THAT THE CHENGUE </p><p>COMMUNITY SERVED AS A RESUPPLY AND R AND R POINT FOR THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS.  THE CHENGUE MASSACRE FITS A PATTERN OF PARA </p><p>ATTACKS ON SMALL COMMUNITIES ON THE NORTH COAST WHICH, IN </p><p>THE PARAS\' VIEW, SERVE AS CIVILIAN BASES OF SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE FARC 35 AND 37 FRONTS.  THE CONTACT DREW PARALLELS </p><p>BETWEEN CHENGUE AND EL SALADO, AFFIRMING THAT EL SALADO </p><p>WAS ALSO A FARC STRONGHOLD, AND THAT IT WAS LOCATED ON THE </p><p>FOOTHILLS OF THE MONTES DE MARIA.  HE CONFIDED THAT NAVAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE HAD INDICATIONS THAT THE PARAS WOULD ATTACK </p><p>ANOTHER NEARBY COMMUNITY, AND WERE CAUGHT OFF-GUARD WHEN </p><p>THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT CHENGUE.  HE WAS VERY SURPRISED </p><p>THAT THE PARAS WERE ABLE TO ENTER CHENGUE UNDETECTED </p><p>SINCE, IN HIS VIEW, THE FARC 37TH FRONT COMPLETELY </p><p>CONTROLS THE AREA AROUND CHENGUE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE CONTACT FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THESE TYPES OF </p><p>INCIDENTS WILL CONTINUE AS THE PARAS AND FARC FIGHT OVER </p><p>CONTROL OF THE ATLANTIC COAST, AND ESPECIALLY FOR CONTROL </p><p>OF THE MONTES DE MARIA.  HE ADDED THAT THE PARA NORTH </p><p>BLOCK IS BEING HEAVILY FINANCED BY CATTLE RANCHERS FROM </p><p>SUCRE, CORDOBA, AND OTHER ATLANTIC DEPARTMENTS, WHO HAVE </p><p>BEEN HURT BY FARC KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTIONS, AND CATTLE </p><p>RUSTLING.  THESE RANCHERS ARE HOPING THE PARAS WILL DRIVE </p><p>THE FARC OUT OF THEIR AREAS SO THAT THEY TOO CAN HAVE THE </p><p>"RELATIVE PEACE" THEIR FELLOW RANCHERS ENJOY IN LARGE </p><p>PARTS OF CORDOBA. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) COLOMBIAN NATIONAL JUDICIAL POLICE (DIJIN) FIGURES </p><p>ON MASSACRES DURING 2000, RELEASED ON JANUARY 18, </p><p>CORROBORATE THE FACT THAT THE ATLANTIC COAST IS SEEING THE </p><p>LARGEST INCREASE IN PARA KILLINGS IN THE COUNTRY. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES, AT LEAST HALF OF ALL THE </p><p>EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS IN 2000 TOOK PLACE IN ATLANTIC </p><p>COAST DEPARTMENTS.  OF ALL COLOMBIAN DEPARTMENTS, BOLIVAR </p><p>HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PARA MURDERS, WITH 76.  SUCRE </p><p>DEPARTMENT REGISTERED 46 PARA-ATTRIBUTED KILLINGS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO FIGURES CITED IN A RECENT COLOMBIAN MILITARY </p><p>BRIEFING TO VISITING DOD OFFICIALS, THERE HAVE BEEN </p><p>SEVENTEEN MASSACRES THIS YEAR, NOT INCLUDING CHENGUE.  OF </p><p>THESE, TWO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY THE FARC, ONE BY THE </p><p>ELN, TEN BY PARA GROUPS, AND THE REST HAVE NOT YET BEEN </p><p>ATTRIBUTED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: IF STATISTICAL TRENDS AND COLOMBIAN NAVAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ARE CORRECT, PARA MASSACRES OF CIVILIAN </p><p>POPULATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR IN THE ATLANTIC COAST, </p><p>AND MAY EVEN INTENSIFY AS THE PARA NORTH BLOCK AND THE </p><p>FARC\'S 35 AND 37 BLOCK FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF THE MONTES DE </p><p>MARIA AND ACCESS TO ATLANTIC PORTS.  THE COLOMBIAN NAVY, </p><p>WHICH HAS SECURITY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE AREAS, SEEMS </p><p>TO HAVE REACTED FAIRLY QUICKLY TO THE MASSACRE, AND HAS </p><p>DEPLOYED MORE THAN 1,000 MARINES AND SPECIAL FORCES IN </p><p>PURSUIT OF THE CULPRITS.  HOWEVER, AS THE NAVY CONTACT </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED, THE PARAS ALSO HAVE A VERY STRONG BASE OF </p><p>SUPPORT IN THE AREA AND CAN EASILY DISAPPEAR AMONG THE </p><p>CIVILIAN POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p></p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
