(S/NF) SUMMARY: In Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa states, the </p><p>military was called to do what the police could not -- </p><p>contain civil unrest.  As with Odi in 1999, the tragedy that </p><p>occurred in Benue demonstrates the problems associated with </p><p>asking often poorly-led soldiers to assume law enforcement </p><p>duties for which they are not trained.  There were two </p><p>massacres in Benue, the initial killing of soldiers by ethnic </p><p>Tiv militia, and the revenge killing of Tivs by soldiers. </p><p>The Benue massacres will force Obasanjo to walk a fine line </p><p>between the rule of law, on one hand, and political </p><p>exigencies, which include his relationship with the military, </p><p>on the other.  Obasanjo must investigate but take care not to </p><p>further estrange the military, which happens to be the </p><p>mainstay of security in several key areas of the country. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==================================== </p><p>WHAT WE KNOW OF BENUE - WHAT WE HEAR </p><p>==================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) Accounts we have heard about what happened in Benue </p><p>vary somewhat in their details.  However, the general picture </p><p>provided by most accounts is similar.  Paras 2 - 7 contain </p><p>what we have been able to piece together thus far.  The 19 </p><p>dead soldiers were in Benue as part of the military </p><p>deployment to defuse a long-standing feud between Tivs and </p><p>Jukuns.  While on patrol, the soldiers were ambushed by Tiv </p><p>militia on or about October 10.  (NOTE: One contact informed </p><p>Poloff that 24 soldiers were captured, but five of the </p><p>soldiers, ethnic Tivs, were released.  We cannot confirm this </p><p>claim.  END NOTE.)  According to previous reporting (Ref G), </p><p>after attempting to turn the soldiers over to the police and </p><p>local leaders, the militia members brutally murdered the </p><p>soldiers and dismembered their bodies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) While most contacts state the soldiers were </p><p>ambushed, there also is a different version of events being </p><p>circulated.  While the Army contended that soldiers gave up </p><p>without a fight, Tivs retort that the soldiers were in league </p><p>with the Jukun militia.  In this rendition, a firefight took </p><p>place where the soldiers and Jukun exhausted their </p><p>ammunition, enabling Tiv fighters to capture them.  At this </p><p>point, local officials refused to get involved.  Worse, the </p><p>Tiv captors got word that the band of Jukun and soldiers had </p><p>attacked other Tivs earlier that day.  Hearing this, the Tivs </p><p>executed 19 of their military captives, giving the five Tivs </p><p>a reprieve.  The Tivs also killed a larger but unspecified </p><p>number of Jukun. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Attributing comments to the Presidential Villa, the </p><p>media reported not-so-veiled threats to local Tiv leaders in </p><p>Benue to turn over the responsible militia members or face </p><p>the consequences.  Media reports of comments from unnamed </p><p>Defense Headquarters "sources" were even stronger.  However, </p><p>during the October 22 funeral for the 16 soldiers whose </p><p>bodies had been recovered, President Obasanjo rejected </p><p>"provocation" and emphasized the responsibility of the </p><p>Federal Government to protect its citizenry.  He said that </p><p>his administration would not be deterred from this objective. </p><p> He also tasked the "security agencies" to track down the </p><p>killers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) On 24 October, soldiers apparently from a unit </p><p>other than those killed (Refs E and H) entered eastern Benue </p><p>from Taraba state, and carried out attacks against the local </p><p>population.  It is impossible to state a specific number of </p><p>casualties.  However, 58 people were reportedly killed in one </p><p>village, and roughly 14 villages were destroyed, as well as </p><p>most of the town of Zaki Biam.  The death toll is likely </p><p>between 100 and 250.  In one village, according to press </p><p>reports, adult males were separated from the others then </p><p>executed.  Retired Chief of Army Staff LTG Malu (who headed </p><p>the Army at the time of the Odi incident), had his house </p><p>destroyed and members of his family killed in the reprisals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) It remains unclear how many new IDPs there are in </p><p>Benue as a result of this latest violence.  National Assembly </p><p>members from Benue have claimed as many as 500,000, other </p><p>reporting (Ref G) places the number near 190,000.  The ICRC </p><p>estimates around 100,000 new IDPs in Benue.  The 190,000 and </p><p>100,000 figures are not incompatible, since perhaps 90,000 </p><p>IDPs had already been created as a result of fighting earlier </p><p>this year.  Approximately 70,000 of the "new" IDPs are </p><p>staying with relatives or friends.  The remaining 30,000 are </p><p>temporarily housed in 14 camps in the state. </p><p>7. (C) Instead of trying to calm the situation, several </p><p>political figures have increased tensions by publicly </p><p>accusing each other of complicity in the violence.  Benue </p><p>Governor George Akume blamed embattled PDP chairman Barnabas </p><p>Gemade for fueling violent student protests against the </p><p>military attacks.  Minister of Defense Danjuma has blamed </p><p>Akume for supporting former Tiv soldiers in an effort to </p><p>destabilize the area.  President Obasanjo even got into the </p><p>act.  He told the press that Akume requested military help in </p><p>Benue, which suggests that Akume should be prepared to take </p><p>the bad with the good regarding the soldiers and their </p><p>transgressions.   Many have accused Danjuma, raised as a </p><p>Jukun, of privately supporting the Jukun militias with arms. </p><p>Others have linked Malu with arming the Tivs, and Malu has </p><p>lashed out at almost everyone.  Despite these recriminations, </p><p>there is no real evidence yet of high-level involvement thus </p><p>far in either the deaths of the 19 soldiers or the military\'s </p><p>response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) A number of meetings have taken place at State House </p><p>to discuss the crisis. On November 7, the President conferred </p><p>with the Governors from Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa to discuss </p><p>ways to end the ethnic violence and reduce the political </p><p>attacks. This meeting may have helped reduce the political </p><p>vituperation, but it is too early to tell whether the </p><p>governors and President developed a workable game plan to </p><p>reduce the violence.  Obasanjo reportedly will hold a repeat </p><p>meeting with the governors, joined by ten elders from each </p><p>state, on November 11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>COMMENT AND ANALYSIS </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S/NF) After the 19 soldiers were killed, statements </p><p>emanating from the Presidential Villa pointed to serious </p><p>consequences if the militia members responsible were not </p><p>surrendered to authorities.  These statements might have been </p><p>viewed as tacit approval by angry soldiers who did not need </p><p>much encouragement to avenge the deaths (Ref D and E).  While </p><p>we do not have evidence pointing to senior officers, it seems </p><p>unlikely, from what we know of the Nigerian military, that </p><p>these actions were taken without the knowledge of some senior </p><p>officers (Refs D,E,F).  On the other hand, if an element of a </p><p>battalion did act without senior approval, then this </p><p>indicates a loss of control in some elements of the Nigerian </p><p>military, something equally troubling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S/NF) Thus far, extensive press coverage has not been </p><p>translated into a sustained public outcry (Ref G).  Frankly, </p><p>the commonly held prejudice that Tiv are an aggressive people </p><p>who "take over" lands belonging to others has played a role. </p><p>There is also a degree of understanding for the Army\'s </p><p>conduct in many quarters of the Nigerian populace.  This is </p><p>partially due to the gruesome nature of the 19 executions. </p><p>It is also due to the realization that the military is the </p><p>last wall between order and unrest.  Should the Army be seen </p><p>as susceptible to attack with impunity, it is feared the </p><p>security situation would rapidly worsen (Ref I). </p><p>Consequently, while many do not approve of the Army\'s </p><p>actions, they see these actions as the high but necessary </p><p>premium that must be paid to ensure the Army can effectively </p><p>play its role as security\'s guarantor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (S/NF) Obasanjo and his government will now have to </p><p>strike the right balance between assuring human rights and </p><p>these vital security imperatives.  Obasanjo realizes he must </p><p>do something to bring the guilty into the dock.  If he does </p><p>nothing, his image as a statesman will be sullied.  Dealing </p><p>with the killers of the soldiers will be relatively easy. </p><p>But handling the soldiers who ran amok will be a different </p><p>matter, particularly if their actions were condoned at a high </p><p>level of the Army or of the Ministry of Defense. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) These events show that Nigeria is difficult soil in </p><p>which to cultivate an abiding respect for the rule of law. </p><p>We are trying to urge this process forward, however.  The </p><p>Embassy press release calling for an impartial investigation </p><p>into the situation is part of this effort, and we will </p><p>continue to raise the importance of transparency and rule of </p><p>law with the GON.  That said, these events also reinforce the </p><p>importance of continued engagement with and training of </p><p>Nigeria\'s police and the military.  Providing the benefits of </p><p>sustained and well-targeted training to those who do respect </p><p>human rights is the best way to advance the process of </p><p>inculcating in the entire military an appreciation for the </p><p>rule of law as well as for democratic civilian rule. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
