(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  Visiting NEA A/S Burns and MFA </p><p>Minstate Hamdan Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan discussed next </p><p>steps in the U.S.-UAE Bilateral Dialogue during a </p><p>1/22 meeting.  Burns praised Hamdan\'s handling of </p><p>the UAEG delegation during the Dialogue\'s November </p><p>launch.  Hamdan sought A/S Burns\' support in moving </p><p>the UAE from Tier III to Tier II in the 2003 TIP </p><p>report.  Noting that he had come under significant </p><p>pressure as a result of his efforts to curtail the </p><p>underage camel jockey trade, Hamdan stated that the </p><p>UAEG remains committed to upholding international </p><p>law and enforcing the new regulations stipulating </p><p>age and weight requirements.  The UAEG, he briefed, </p><p>is actively considering ratifying two key </p><p>international protocols connected to the trafficking </p><p>issue.  Burns thanked Hamdan for his personal </p><p>efforts and encouraged movement on the export </p><p>controls road-map as well as towards the signing of </p><p>an ICC Article 98 agreement.  Hamdan and A/S Burns </p><p>agreed that the MEPI is a promising area for </p><p>bilateral engagement.  Hamdan expressed concern </p><p>about the difficulties encountered by UAE students </p><p>in the U.S. as a result of enhanced security </p><p>measures.  Burns hoped that the next academic year </p><p>would see more UAE students returning to the U.S. </p><p>and noted efforts underway to help prepare foreign </p><p>students for the new requirements.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) NEA A/S Burns met with UAE de facto Foreign </p><p>Minister Hamdan Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan 1/22 (other </p><p>topics reported septel).  Burns was joined by the </p><p>Ambassador, JCS Captain Dom and Polchief </p><p>(notetaker).  Hamdan was attended by MFA Assistant </p><p>Undersecretary for Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid </p><p>Al-Nuaimi, Office Director Sultan Al-Romaithi and </p><p>Yousef Al-Otaiba, the assistant to Armed Forces </p><p>Chief of Staff Muhammad Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>HELP SOUGHT FOR MOVING UAE FROM TIER III TO II </p><p>IN 2003 TIP REPORT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Hamdan sought Burns\' support in moving the </p><p>UAE from Tier III to Tier II in this year\'s </p><p>trafficking in persons report.  Despite the fact </p><p>that he had encountered significant resistance and </p><p>criticism -- primarily from the tribal old guard -- </p><p>Hamdan noted that he remains committed to putting an </p><p>end to the trafficking in young boys to the UAE for </p><p>use as camel jockeys.  The UAEG, he explained, is </p><p>enforcing the new regulations stipulating age and </p><p>weight requirements, though these measures have been </p><p>more successful in some emirates (i.e. Abu Dhabi) </p><p>than others (i.e. Dubai and the northern emirates). </p><p>However, Hamdan continued, we are committed to </p><p>working within international law.  USG recognition, </p><p>i.e. via a move from Tier III to Tier II, of the </p><p>serious steps taken to end this trade in the UAE </p><p>would be a great motivating factor for future </p><p>enforcement efforts.  Burns expressed appreciation </p><p>for Hamdan\'s personal efforts, noting that we fully </p><p>understand the internal pressures he is up against. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The MFA and the Ministry of the Interior, </p><p>Hamdan briefed, are discussing the possibility of </p><p>the UAE ratifying the Sale of Children Protocol </p><p>(Supplementing the Rights of the Child Convention, </p><p>to which the UAE acceded in 1997).  At the same </p><p>time, the MFA is consulting with the Ministry of </p><p>Justice on whether the UAE should sign and ratify </p><p>the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish </p><p>Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and </p><p>Children (Supplementing the UN Convention Against </p><p>Transnational Organized Crime, to which the UAE </p><p>acceded in December, 2002).  Burns welcomed these </p><p>moves. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>PROGRESS URGED ON EXBS AND ICC ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) With regard to implementation of the agreed </p><p>export controls/border security (EXBS) roadmap, </p><p>Hamdan briefed that he had sent a letter to the </p><p>Cabinet the previous day recommending the </p><p>establishment of a Cabinet-level committee to </p><p>oversee implementation of this ambitious slate of </p><p>training courses.  Burns thanked Hamdan for his </p><p>engagement and noted that we look forward to </p><p>progress on this issue.  Turning to the ICC Article </p><p>98 agreement, Burns hoped that we could move towards </p><p>negotiations, noting that it continues by be a key </p><p>issue for the President and Secretary Powell. </p><p>Abdullah Rashid piped in that the UAEG is actively </p><p>studying the draft agreement, but needs to resolve </p><p>possible conflicts with the UAE\'s constitution and </p><p>the UAE\'s obligations to other countries before </p><p>responding to us with specific issues for </p><p>clarification. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>MEPI ENGAGEMENT ENCOURAGED </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) A/S Burns briefed that we hope to engage </p><p>the UAEG on a number of opportunities in the </p><p>educational and economic realms.  The Middle East </p><p>Partnership Initiative, which Burns carefully noted </p><p>was not intended to dictate solutions, could be a </p><p>useful engagement tool.  He welcomed a pooling of </p><p>resources and an exchange of information, </p><p>particularly with regard to economic reform and </p><p>steps towards greater political participation. </p><p>Burns noted in his upcoming visit, NEA/RA Director </p><p>Gary Grappo would brief UAEG interlocutors on what </p><p>the MEPI has to offer.  Hamdan welcomed the </p><p>cooperation, commenting that the UAE is open to new </p><p>initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT DROPPING NUMBER OF UAE STUDENTS IN US </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Explaining that many of the UAE\'s 2,500 </p><p>students in the U.S. had curtailed their studies and </p><p>returned home because of the "many problems" </p><p>encountered with visas and the new registration </p><p>system and security measures, Hamdan asked if A/S </p><p>Burns had anything new to convey.  Burns noted that </p><p>we are aware of the problems facing foreign students </p><p>and that a drop in the foreign student population </p><p>was one of the unintended consequences of the post- </p><p>9/11 enhanced security measures.  We hope to </p><p>alleviate these concerns by more fully explaining </p><p>the new system and prepping students for what to </p><p>expect.  It is in our collective interest, Burns </p><p>asserted, to send Emiratis for higher study in the </p><p>U.S.  Abdullah Rashid briefed that several Emirati </p><p>students had been detained while registering for </p><p>NSEERS because their transcripts did not accurately </p><p>reflect their course load.  The Ambassador noted </p><p>that the students involved had been detained only </p><p>briefly and that their universities had responded </p><p>quickly, explaining any perceived discrepancies to </p><p>the INS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) This cable has been cleared by A/S Burns. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
