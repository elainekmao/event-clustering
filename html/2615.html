(U)  SUMMARY:  DIVIDED BY THE OLD DMZ, QUANG TRI AND </p><p>QUANG BINH ARE UNITED IN POVERTY NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF </p><p>WAR\'S DESTRUCTION, BUT BECAUSE OF UNFAVORABLE GEOGRAPHY. </p><p>REMOTE AND WITH LITTLE SURVIVING PRE-WAR INFRASTRUCTURE, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND A GREAT DEAL OF HARD </p><p>WORK ARE ASSISTING BOTH PROVINCES TO OVERCOME THEIR POVERTY. </p><p>THINLY STRETCHED LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES BOTH BUDDHIST AND </p><p>CHRISTIAN FOLLOWERS IN THESE PROVINCES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>OBSCURE QUANG BINH STRUGGLES WITH POVERTY; EXPECTS HELP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE QUANG BINH PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE, PHAN VIET DUNG, RECEIVED POLOFF AND POL FSN ON </p><p>JANUARY 9, ALONG WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF HALF A DOZEN </p><p>PROVINCIAL OFFICES.  THE VICE CHAIRMAN CALLED FOR US </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, CITING THE MANY DIFFICULTIES QUANG </p><p>BINH FACES, MOST NOTABLY THE HARSH WEATHER, GEOGRAPHICAL </p><p>CONDITIONS, AND ITS REMOTENESS.  HE DID NOT DIRECTLY BLAME </p><p>THE WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH FOR SLOW PACE OF DEVELOPMENT IN </p><p>QUANG BINH, MERELY SAYING THAT, "THE WAR USED TO BE QUITE </p><p>FIERCE HERE".  ACCORDING TO VICE CHAIRMAN DUNG, QUANG BINH\'S </p><p>PER CAPITA INCOME IS $200, ABOUT HALF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. </p><p>SOME 25 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS BELOW THE POVERTY LINE, </p><p>WITH THE PERCENTAGE HIGHEST AMONG ETHNIC GROUPS LIVING IN </p><p>REMOTE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICTS.  HE SAID THE PROVINCE WAS </p><p>STRIVING TO REDUCE THE POVERTY RATE TO 15 PERCENT IN THE </p><p>YEAR 2002.  HE TOLD POLOFF THAT QUANG BINH NEEDED ASSISTANCE </p><p>FROM NGOS, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND FOREIGN </p><p>EMBASSIES TO REACH THAT TARGET. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00573  01 OF 04  140431Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  WORLD WIDE FUND FOR NATURE (WWF) IS WORKING IN </p><p>QUANG BINH TO HELP PRESERVE UNUSUAL LIMESTONE MOUNTAIN </p><p>FOREST HABITAT NEAR THE LAO BORDER.  PART OF THE PROJECT, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MARIANNE MELJBOOM, A RESIDENT WWF FIELD ADVISOR </p><p>WHO SPOKE TO POLOFF AND POL FSN ON JANUARY 9, CONSISTS OF </p><p>RESETTLING AND IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOODS OF A FEW DOZEN </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY FAMILIES CURRENTLY LIVING WITHIN THE </p><p>BOUNDARIES OF A NATIONAL PARK.  MELJBOOM POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>VERY LITTLE LOGGING HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE PARK AND </p><p>SURROUNDING AREAS, LEAVING THE FOREST LARGELY INTACT AND </p><p>THAT TIGERS AND A LARGE VARIETY OF PRIMATES ARE STILL FOUND </p><p>IN THE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  DONG HOI TOWN, THE CAPITAL OF QUANG BINH APPEARED </p><p>VERY QUIET, EVEN SLEEPY.  THE LOCAL MARKET WAS MODERATELY </p><p>BUSY, OFFERING A WIDE VARIETY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, BUT </p><p>THE TOWN\'S STREETS WERE TRANQUIL ELSEWHERE.  THERE WERE FEW </p><p>TOURISTS IN EVIDENCE.  INTERNET SERVICE APPEARED TO BE </p><p>AVAILABLE ONLY AT A BRANCH POST OFFICE AND A HUE UNIVERSITY </p><p>EXTENSION CENTER AND WAS FIVE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IN </p><p>HANOI.  COMPUTER CLASSES AT THE EXTENSION CENTER APPEARED </p><p>FULL, HOWEVER.  THE BRICK RUINS OF DONG HOI\'S OLD CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH, PICTURED ON POSTCARDS AND IN HANOI\'S MUSEUM OF THE </p><p>REVOLUTION, WERE TURNED INTO A PARK IN 1997.  A PLAQUE BEARS </p><p>AN ACCOUNT OF CHURCH\'S DESTRUCTION BY AMERICAN BOMBERS IN </p><p>1972.  THE PARK DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED FOR </p><p>SOME TIME.  THE PLANTER BOXES ARE CHOKED WITH WEEDS, THE </p><p>ORNAMENTAL TREES HAVE DIED, AND THE PARK\'S LIGHTS APPEAR TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN BROKEN FOR A LONG TIME.  POLOFF FOUND USED </p><p>SYRINGES ON THE GROUND NEAR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00573  01 OF 04  140431Z </p><p>CHURCH\'S SANCTUARY. </p><p> </p><p>QUANG TRI IS OPEN AND USED TO FOREIGNERS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THE MOST APPARENT CONTRAST BETWEEN QUANG BINH AND </p><p>QUANG TRI IS THE DEGREE OF FOREIGN PRESENCE.  RESIDENT </p><p>FOREIGNERS IN QUANG BINH ARE FEW AND TOURISTS SEEM RARE. </p><p>SEVERAL FOREIGN NGO\'S OPERATE AND HAVE STAFF IN QUANG TRI, </p><p>BUT ONLY FEW WORLD WILDLIFE FUND EXPERTS LIVE IN AN OUTLYING </p><p>DISTRICT OF QUANG BINH.  VISITS WITH SOME NGO STAFFERS IN </p><p>QUANG TRI SHOWED THAT THEY HAD EXCELLENT WORKING </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS.  FOREIGN TOURISTS </p><p>AND BUSINESSES THAT CATER TO THEM ARE COMMON.  DONG HO TOWN </p><p>HAD SEVERAL INTERNET CAFES.  ONE, THE DMZ CAFE, RUN BY AN </p><p>ENGLISH-SPEAKING INDIVIDUAL WHO DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS AN ARVN </p><p>VETERAN RESPONSIBLE FOR LIAISON WITH THE U.S. MARINE CORPS, </p><p>BOASTED A CONNECTION SPEED TWICE AS FAST AS NORMALLY </p><p>AVAILABLE IN HANOI. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  WHILE POLOFF\'S VISIT SEEMED TO GENERATE A HIGH </p><p>LEVEL OF INTEREST IN QUANG BINH, WITH AS MANY AS FOUR </p><p>PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT NOTE-TAKERS AT SOME MEETINGS, QUANG </p><p>TRI\'S RECEPTION WAS FRIENDLY, BUT RATHER LOW-KEY.  DURING A </p><p>FIFTY-MINUTE MEETING, QUANG TRI PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE VICE CHAIRMAN NGUYEN DUC CHINH, SPENT AT LEAST TEN </p><p>MINUTES DISCUSSING THE CONDITION OF SOME SURPLUS DEPARTMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1941 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00573  02 OF 04  140431Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    EXME-00 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01 </p><p>      H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /020W </p><p>                  ------------------743EB1  140432Z /38 </p><p>R 140406Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5767 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 HANOI 000573 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00573  02 OF 04  140431Z </p><p> </p><p>OF DEFENSE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT DONATED TO THE PROVINCE IN 2001 </p><p>RELATED TO THEN-PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S NOVEMBER 2000 VISIT TO </p><p>VIETNAM.  VICE CHAIRMAN CHINH EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE </p><p>DEFENSE ATTACHE OFFICE\'S EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS. </p><p>HE MENTIONED THE AFTERMATH OF THE WAR IN QUANG TRI, BUT </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE PROVINCE\'S DESIRE FOR MORE US INVESTMENT AND </p><p>APPRECIATION OF ASSISTANCE TO DATE.  HE REPORTED THAT AS ONE </p><p>OF QUANG TRI\'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES HE HAD VOTED FOR </p><p>THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT.  POLOFF NOTED </p><p>THAT ONE OF THE PROVINCE\'S ATTRACTIONS TO FOREIGN INVESTORS </p><p>WOULD BE THE EXCELLENT WORKING RELATIONSHIP FOREIGN NGO\'S </p><p>SEEM TO ENJOY WITH THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>QUANG TRI - HARD WORK TO TURN SAND INTO SOIL </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  ON JANUARY 10, POLOFF AND POL STAFF VISITED A UNDP </p><p>AND NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED LIVELIHOOD PROJECT AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT SITE ABOUT 30 KILOMETERS SOUTHEAST OF DONG HA </p><p>TOWN.  THE PROJECT BENEFICIARIES, WE WERE TOLD, COME FROM A </p><p>NEARBY FISHING VILLAGE ON THE COAST.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, THE </p><p>VILLAGE\'S MEN FISH WHEN WEATHER PERMITS AND THE WOMEN SELL </p><p>THE FISH IN LOCAL MARKETS.  THERE IS NO FISHING FOR SEVERAL </p><p>MONTHS AND WITH NO LAND AND NO OTHER TRADES, THEY ARE </p><p>EXTREMELY POOR, SAID THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN.  THE LIVELIHOOD </p><p>AND RESETTLEMENT PROJECT AIMS TO RECLAIM NEARBY BARREN LAND </p><p>FOR AGRICULTURE AND THUS IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY\'S STANDARD OF </p><p>LIVING. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00573  02 OF 04  140431Z </p><p>8.  (U)  UPON JOINING THE PROJECT, EACH HOUSEHOLD IS GIVEN A </p><p>FEW HECTARES OF SANDY LAND  ONE TO TWO KILOMETERS INLAND. </p><p>MUCH OF THE CENTRAL COASTAL REGION OF VIETNAM, INCLUDING THE </p><p>PROJECT SITE, IS PLAGUED WITH HIGH WINDS AND "FLYING SAND" </p><p>ALL YEAR ROUND. THERE IS LITTLE WATER DURING THE DRY SEASON, </p><p>AND THE SOIL, CONSISTING ALMOST ENTIRELY OF WINDBLOWN SAND, </p><p>IS INFERTILE AND WILL NOT HOLD WATER.  THERE IS ALMOST NO </p><p>NATURAL VEGETATION AND THERE IS NO SIGN THAT ANYONE EVER </p><p>TRIED TO FARM THIS LAND BEFORE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  BESIDES LAND, EACH FAMILY REPORTEDLY RECEIVES </p><p>ENOUGH RICE AND CASH TO SUSTAIN THEM FOR SIX MONTHS.  THE </p><p>FAMILIES ALSO RECEIVE TEN MILLION VND (USD 700) INTEREST </p><p>FREE LOANS TO BUILD HOUSES, PUT IN WELLS, AND MAKE CAPITAL </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS.  NO PAYMENTS ARE REQUIRED ON THE LOANS FOR TWO </p><p>YEARS.  RECLAIMING THE LAND REQUIRES THAT THE FISHER-FOLK </p><p>TURNED FARMERS PLANT WINDBREAKS (PRIMARILY HARDY PINES AND </p><p>CASAURINAS) TO PROTECT THEIR CROPS FROM THE FLYING SAND AND </p><p>TO STABILIZE THE SAND ENOUGH TO BEGIN CREATING SOIL.  AFTER </p><p>THREE TO FOUR YEARS THE WINDBREAKS ARE TALL AND DENSE ENOUGH </p><p>TO BE EFFECTIVE.  THE LABOR-INTENSIVE PROCESS OF TURNING </p><p>SAND INTO SOIL BEGINS WITH ADDING PARTIALLY COMPOSTED RICE </p><p>STRAW AND MANURE TO THE PLANTING BEDS.  THE NEW FARMERS HAVE </p><p>TO TRAVEL SEVERAL KILOMETERS TO OBTAIN THESE INPUTS.  SWEET </p><p>POTATOES ARE THE CROP OF CHOICE, ESPECIALLY IN THE </p><p>BEGINNING, SINCE THEY ARE LESS VULNERABLE TO THE WIND, EASY </p><p>FOR THE NOVICE FARMERS TO GROW, AND TOLERATE THE SAND.   THE </p><p>FIRST PROJECT BENEFICIARIES BEGAN RECLAIMING LAND IN 1994. </p><p>WHILE THEIR SOIL IS PERCEPTIBLY BETTER THAN THE UNRECLAIMED </p><p>SAND, THEY STILL ADD JUST AS MUCH RICE STRAW AND MANURE AS </p><p>THEY DID IN THE BEGINNING. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00573  02 OF 04  140431Z </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  POLOFF AND POL FSN TALKED WITH A NUMBER OF </p><p>PROJECT BENEFICIARIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  THE NEW PROJECT </p><p>PARTICIPANT WE VISITED, A SINGLE MOTHER, OCCUPIED BARELY </p><p>IMPROVED LAND.  THE SUN GLARING OFF THE WHITE SAND WAS </p><p>PAINFULLY BRIGHT.  SHE SAID SHE SPENT MOST OF HER DAY MAKING </p><p>RAISED PLANTING BEDS FOR HER SWEET POTATOES, ADMITTING IT </p><p>WAS VERY HARD WORK.  SHE HAD NEVER FARMED BEFORE, SO SHE </p><p>DEPENDED ON THE PROJECT\'S TECHNICAL EXPERTS FOR ADVICE, SHE </p><p>SAID.  A FEW HUNDRED METERS FURTHER INLAND WERE FARMS UNDER </p><p>CULTIVATION FOR THREE TO FOUR YEARS.  WHILE THE SOIL SHOWED </p><p>LITTLE SIGN OF IMPROVEMENT, THE FARMERS WERE GROWING SEVERAL </p><p>DIFFERENT CROPS AND BEGINNING TO PLANT A FEW FRUIT TREES. </p><p>WITH SOME SHELTER FROM THEIR WINDBREAKS, THEIR FARMSTEADS </p><p>WERE A LITTLE MORE PLEASANT THAN THE STARK FIRST YEAR </p><p>FARMER\'S.  FINALLY WE VISITED A FARM UNDER CULTIVATION FOR </p><p>SEVEN YEARS.  THE FAMILY THERE ENJOYED THE SHELTER OF TALL </p><p>WINDBREAKS, GREW SEVERAL DIFFERENT CROPS, WAS RAISING DUCKS </p><p>AND BEGINNING TO HARVEST CITRUS, AND HAD PLANTED COCONUT </p><p>PALMS.  THEY EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH HOW THEIR SOIL WAS </p><p>IMPROVING AND HOW THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING HAD IMPROVED. </p><p>THEY SAID THEY HAD OBTAINED ADDITIONAL LOANS TO ADD ONTO </p><p>THEIR HOUSE AND TO BEGIN MAKING CONCRETE ROOFING TILES. </p><p>THEY SAID THAT THEIR OVERALL INCOME WAS OVER 12 MILLION VND </p><p>(ABOUT USD 800) AND GROWING, FAR BETTER THAN IT HAD BEEN IN </p><p>THE FISHING VILLAGE.  NEIGHBORING FARMS APPEARED TO BE </p><p>SIMILARLY PROSPEROUS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1942 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00573  03 OF 04  140432Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    EXME-00 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01 </p><p>      H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /020W </p><p>                  ------------------743EBC  140432Z /38 </p><p>R 140406Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5768 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 HANOI 000573 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00573  03 OF 04  140432Z </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  ACCORDING TO THE DISTRICT DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, THE </p><p>UNDP AND NORWEGIAN OFFICIALS WERE PLEASED WITH PROJECT\'S </p><p>RESULTS.  HE ADDED THAT MOST OF THE SETTLERS FOUND THE </p><p>PROJECT USEFUL, AND THAT APPLICATIONS TO JOIN THE PROGRAM </p><p>OUTSTRIP FUNDING.   WHILE THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF </p><p>UNRECLAIMED LAND, MOST OF THE FUNDING AT THIS POINT IS FROM </p><p>REPAYMENT OF THE STARTUP LOANS, HE SAID.  THE LACK OF </p><p>FUNDING HAS HINDERED THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATION FROM EXPANDING </p><p>THE PROJECT, HE COMPLAINED; THUS, THE PROVINCE NOW HOPES FOR </p><p>FUNDING FROM FOREIGN NGOS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO </p><p>CONDUCT SIMILAR PROJECTS IN THE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>MONKS AND NUNS ABSENT IN QUANG BINH, SCARCE IN QUANG TRI </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO LOCAL OFFICIALS, THERE ARE JUST 6 </p><p>BUDDHIST TEMPLES IN QUANG BINH PROVINCE, AND NO RESIDENT </p><p>MONKS OR NUNS. EXPLAINING THE SITUATION, PROVINCIAL </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS AND MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS </p><p>STAFF SAID NO ONE FROM QUANG BINH HAD EVER WANTED TO ENTER </p><p>RELIGIOUS LIFE.  LATER, THICH CHANH LIEM, THE HEAD OF QUANG </p><p>TRI\'S PROVINCIAL BUDDHIST ASSOCIATION AND ABBOT OF CHAU </p><p>QUANG PAGODA, CONFIRMED THAT THERE WERE FEW BUDDHISTS IN </p><p>QUANG BINH, BUT DID RECALL THAT AT LEAST ONE FAMOUS LIVING </p><p>MONK WAS A QUANG BINH NATIVE.  THICH CHANH LIEM SAID THAT </p><p>QUANG TRI\'S POPULATION WAS 70 TO 80 PERCENT BUDDHIST. </p><p>HOWEVER, WHILE THERE ARE 170 SHRINES SCATTERED AROUND THE </p><p>PROVINCE, THERE ARE ONLY THREE MAJOR PAGODAS, ALL IN DONG HO </p><p>TOWN.  HE SAID THAT THE FACILITIES WERE IN POOR CONDITION. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00573  03 OF 04  140432Z </p><p>MOREOVER, QUANG TRI HAD VERY FEW MONKS AND NUNS COMPARED TO </p><p>OTHER PROVINCES.  THE ABBOT SAID THAT THE ASSOCIATION PLANS </p><p>TO OPEN A SCHOOL TO TRAIN MONKS.  THEY HAVE NOT APPLIED FOR </p><p>PERMISSION YET BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE ABBOT, THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES REQUIRE THAT THE SCHOOL HAVE 50 - 60 STUDENTS, </p><p>BUT THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 30 CANDIDATES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>LOTS OF CATHOLICS, BUT NOT MANY PRIESTS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  FOUR PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ACCOMPANIED POLOFF AND </p><p>POL STAFF TO A MEETING WITH THE PROVINCE\'S SENIOR CATHOLIC </p><p>PRIEST AT HUONG PHUONG PARISH NORTHWEST OF DONG HOI. </p><p>ACCORDING TO PROVINCIAL RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS OFFICIALS AND THE </p><p>PRIEST, THERE ARE ROUGHLY 85,000 CATHOLIC BELIEVERS AND 12 </p><p>PRIESTS (ABOUT ONE PER 7000 BELIEVERS) IN QUANG BINH\'S 26 </p><p>PARISHES.  THE PROVINCE\'S PARISHES ARE A SUBDIVISION OF THE </p><p>DIOCESE OF VINH, ACCORDING TO THE PRIEST, WHO SAID AS </p><p>CURATE, HE WAS ADMINISTRATIVELY IN CHARGE OF THE PROVINCE\'S </p><p>PARISHES BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO FAR FROM VINH FOR THE BISHOP </p><p>TO MANAGE.  HE SAID THAT THE BISHOP VISITS EACH OF QUANG </p><p>BINH\'S PARISHES ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS.  HE ADDED THAT THE </p><p>CATHOLICS INTEND TO APPLY TO FORM A NEW DIOCESE WHEN THEY </p><p>HAVE ENOUGH PRIESTS."  HE DID NOT INDICATE WHEN THAT </p><p>CONDITION WOULD BE MET.  THE PRIEST INDICATED THAT MOST </p><p>CATHOLICS LIVE IN LARGELY CATHOLIC VILLAGES AND ARE FAIRLY </p><p>CONCENTRATED GEOGRAPHICALLY.  THERE WAS ANOTHER CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH ONLY TWO KILOMETERS FROM HUONG PHUONG.  HUONG PHUONG </p><p>PARISH\'S CHURCH BUILDING WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS OLD AND </p><p>ACCOMMODATED 800 OR MORE PEOPLE FOR SUNDAY SERVICES.  THE </p><p>PRIEST ALSO NOTED THAT NUNS PLAY A LARGE ROLE IN CHURCH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00573  03 OF 04  140432Z </p><p>EDUCATION.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS ON THE PROVINCE\'S FATHERLAND </p><p>FRONT COMMITTEE AND REMARKED THAT CATHOLICS IN QUANG BINH </p><p>HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY WERE GOOD </p><p>CITIZENS AND CONTRIBUTED TO NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION.  THUS, HE </p><p>CONCLUDED, THEY WERE FREE TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION WITHOUT </p><p>INTERFERENCE.  HOWEVER, WHILE HE EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH </p><p>CURRENT PROGRAMS FOR TRAINING PRIESTS (QUANG BINH HAD ONLY </p><p>SIX PRIESTS WHEN HE BECAME CURATE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO), THE </p><p>CHURCH COULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER FOR BELIEVERS HAD THEY </p><p>MORE PRIESTS.

(SBU)  FATHER TRAN VAN TUYEN MET POLOFF AND POL STAFF </p><p>ON JANUARY 11 AT THE DONG HA TOWN PARISH CHURCH.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT HE WAS ORDAINED IN 1968 IN HUE AND HAD BEEN IN HIS </p><p>CURRENT PARISH FOR FOUR YEARS.  QUANG TRI\'S ROUGHLY TWO </p><p>DOZEN PARISHES SHARE NINE PRIESTS AND AVERAGE ABOUT 500 - </p><p>600 MEMBERS.  THE PRIEST SAID THAT HIS PARISH IS QUITE LARGE </p><p>AND THAT HE "COULD HARDLY HANDLE THE WORK."  HE SAID, </p><p>NODDING AT THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>PRESENT, THEY HAD APPLIED FOR A VICAR TO EASE THE PROBLEM, </p><p>BUT HAD RECEIVED NO RESPONSE FROM THE AUTHORITIES.  HE </p><p>ADDED, "OBVIOUSLY THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH WORK FOR ALL THE </p><p>PRIESTS" IN QUANG TRI.  THEY ARE PART OF THE DIOCESE OF HUE </p><p>AND A BISHOP VISITS EACH PARISH EVERY THIRD YEAR.  MOST OF </p><p>THE CHURCH BUILDINGS, HE SAID, WERE DESTROYED DURING THE WAR </p><p>AND ONLY A FEW HAVE BEEN REBUILT.

THE EAGERNESS OF </p><p>QUANG TRI\'S RESETTLED FISHING FAMILIES TO UNDERTAKE THE </p><p>BACKBREAKING WORK OF TURNING BLOWING SAND INTO PRODUCTIVE </p><p>FARMLAND INDICATES HOW POOR THIS PART OF VIETNAM IS.  WAR </p><p>DAMAGE AND THE AFTEREFFECTS OF WAR CONTRIBUTE TO THIS </p><p>POVERTY, BUT THE WAR\'S LEGACY HAS ALSO BROUGHT ATTENTION TO </p><p>QUANG TRI, IF NOT TO QUANG BINH.
