<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000523 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Claire blasts Blair\'s blurry vision" </p><p>      the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      dedicated its March 12 editorial to criticizing </p><p>      President George Bush for imposing sanctions on the </p><p>      Mugabe government, saying the executive order is "a </p><p>      calculated program to oust President Mugabe and </p><p>      install an MDC puppet regime."  Adding, "the </p><p>      so-called smart sanctions on Zimbabwe and its </p><p>      leaders will adversely affect the generality of the </p><p>      people in the country, especially the vulnerable." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .After sheepishly endorsing Tony Blairs\' </p><p>      imperialist foreign policies, some senior Britons </p><p>      appear to be seeing the light and giving an ear to </p><p>      the voice of reason. . .Britain\'s International </p><p>      Development Minister, Ms. Claire Short has </p><p>      threatened to resign if her government goes to war </p><p>      with Iraq without being sanctioned by the United </p><p>      nations. . .  Blair and his cousin, George W. Bush </p><p>      of the United Sates, have appointed themselves the </p><p>      world policing agents and are determined to </p><p>      undermine everyone including the U.N. in their bid </p><p>      to eliminate any voices in the political arena they </p><p>      consider to be odd.  They appear resolved to usher </p><p>      in a culture in world politics where all leaders do </p><p>      not see, hear or speak evil about their neo-colonial </p><p>      foreign policies. </p><p> </p><p>      "According to reports, Bush issued an executive </p><p>      order on Friday to the U.S. Congress accusing the </p><p>      ruling party in Zimbabwe of undermining </p><p>      democracy. . .  The order is clearly part of a </p><p>      calculated program to oust President Mugabe and </p><p>      install an MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) </p><p>      puppet regime with a view to reversing the land </p><p>      reform program. . .  It is ironic that people like </p><p>      Bush, who became president through the courts, want </p><p>      to preach democracy to President Mugabe who spent </p><p>      several years in prisons and in the bush fighting </p><p>      for a democratic dispensation in Zimbabwe.  We view </p><p>      the interference of the Blair and Bush </p><p>      administrations on Zimbabwe and other Third World </p><p>      countries as terrorism and demand that the United </p><p>      Nations censure them.  Britain and the U.S. need </p><p>      more people of the mould of Ms. Short to help knock </p><p>      sense into the Blairs and Bushes of this world.  The </p><p>      war on Iraq will kill the innocent, mostly women and </p><p>      children, and it is not surprising that Ms. Short is </p><p>      opposed to it.  On a similar vein the so-called </p><p>      smart sanctions on Zimbabwe and its leaders will </p><p>      adversely affect the generality of the people in the </p><p>      country, especially the vulnerable." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
