SUMMARY:  ISSUES FEATURED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA INCLUDED THE WEF </p><p>MEETING IN JORDAN, U.S. EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE PEACE BETWEEN THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS, AND IRAQ.  A COLUMNIST WARNED AGAINST </p><p>THE WEF, SAYING THAT IT WAS FIRST INITIATED BY SHIMON PERES AND </p><p>NOTING THAT THE ROOT OF THE MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM IS THE (ISRAELI) </p><p>OCCUPATION.  AN EDITORIAL IN "AL-KHALEEJ" WARNED AGAINST ALLEGED </p><p>ISRAELI AMBITIONS IN IRAQ, URGING ALL ARABS TO COUNTER THEM.  A </p><p>COLUMNIST IN "AL-ITTIHAD" ASSERTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF DEMOCRACY </p><p>AND THE FLOURISHING OF POLITICAL ISLAM ARE THE LEADING FACTORS </p><p>THAT HAVE PREVENTED ARAB WOMEN FROM FULL PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>POLITICAL LIFE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE \'THE BURIAL OF THE MIDDLE EAST ECONOMIC </p><p>PROJECT," PSEUDONYMOUS COLUMNIST IBN AL-DEIRA WROTE IN SHARJAH- </p><p>BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" 6/21: </p><p> </p><p>"THE DAVOS INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC FORUM CONVENES AT THIS TIME IN </p><p>AN ARAB COUNTRY ON THE BANKS OF THE DEAD SEA, FOLLOWING ISRAELI </p><p>EXPANSIONIST POLICIES\' FREEZE OF ALL ECONOMIC MEETINGS OF THIS </p><p>NATURE DURING THE LAST SIX YEARS... WHAT\'S NEW ABOUT THIS </p><p>EXCEPTIONAL MEETING ON THE DEAD SEA IS THAT THE PROMOTER OF THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE IS NOT SHIMON PERES BUT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT GEORGE </p><p>BUSH, WHO IS DROWNING IN IRAQ\'S SHIFTING SANDS, AND WHO IS LOST </p><p>IN THE NARROW STREETS OF A CONFUSING MAP FOR A ROAD TOWARDS PEACE </p><p>IN PALESTINE.  THE OBJECTIVE CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF ANY </p><p>ECONOMIC PROJECT IN THE MIDDLE EAST CONTINUE TO BE ABSENT AND </p><p>BURIED BENEATH PALESTINIAN ASHES AND BODIES DESTROYED BY SHARON\'S </p><p>TANKS AND PLANES...THE ARAB CITIZEN DOES NOT NEED ANYONE TO </p><p>PROVOKE HIM AGAINST U.S. POLICIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  SHARON IS </p><p>CAPABLE OF DOING SO, AND DREAMING OF ECONOMIC CONFERENCES WILL DO </p><p>NO GOOD FOR THE DEAD SEA MEETING.  THE ROOTS OF TERRORISM ARE THE </p><p>OCCUPATION." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "ISRAEL IS IN IRAQ," "AL-KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 6/21: </p><p> </p><p>"THE DANGER THAT THREATENS IRAQ AND THE REST OF THE ARAB REGION </p><p>IS NOT ONLY REPRESENTED BY THE AMERICAN MILITARY OCCUPATION, BUT </p><p>ALSO BY ISRAELI SECURITY AND ECONOMIC ATTEMPTS TO PENETRATE INTO </p><p>THE IRAQI ARENA THROUGH THE OCCUPATION.... IRAQ HAS BECOME AN </p><p>OCCUPIED COUNTRY LACKING INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND ITS </p><p>PEOPLE LACKING FREEDOM, WHILE ITS DESTINY AND FUTURE WILL BE </p><p>DEFINED ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN WILL.  THEREFORE, THE MISSION </p><p>OF COUNTERING ISRAELI EXPANSION INTO IRAQ IS NOT THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE ALONE.  THE ARAB COUNTRIES ARE </p><p>REQUIRED TO WAKE UP FROM THEIR STATE OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS TO </p><p>CONFRONT AN IMMINENT DANGER..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  KUWAITI COLUMNIST DR. SHAMLAN YOUSUF AL-EISSA WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL ABU DHABI-BASED ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD" 6/22: </p><p> </p><p>"...WHY HAVE ARAB WOMEN NOT HAD THEIR RIGHTS DESPITE LONG YEARS </p><p>OF STRUGGLE?  WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS, WHICH </p><p>WE WOULD NOT FIND APPROPRIATE TO MENTION HERE.  HOWEVER, WE CAN </p><p>SAY THAT THE BACKWARDNESS OF ARAB SOCIETIES, THE ABSENCE OF FREE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REGIMES, THE PREVALENCE OF TOTALITARIAN PARTIES AND </p><p>THE FLOURISHING OF POLITICAL ISLAM IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ARE ALL </p><p>FACTORS THAT HELPED TO FOIL THE WOMEN\'S MOVEMENT IN THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
