(C) SUMMARY: SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE HAD A </p><p>PRODUCTIVE MEETING ON BURUNDI WITH A RECEPTIVE NELSON </p><p>MANDELA ON JULY 17 REGARDING THE STATE OF PLAY OF THE </p><p>ARUSHA AGREEMENT AND PLANS FOR THE JULY 19-20 MEETING </p><p>OF REGIONAL HEADS OF STATE.  WOLPE MADE INROADS ON </p><p>TOPICS SUCH AS THE DANGER OF SIGNING AN AGREEMENT </p><p>PREMATURELY, THE DIFFICULT AND UNRESOLVED NATURE OF </p><p>TRANSITIONAL LEADERSHIP, THE DESIRABILITY OF A </p><p>SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES PRIOR TO A FORMAL SIGNING </p><p>CEREMONY, AND THE NUANCES OF THE POLITICAL PRISONER ISSUE. </p><p>MANDELA WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THAT ADDITIONAL U.S. FUNDING </p><p>FOR THE ARUSHA PROCESS IS ON ITS WAY, AND LOOKS FORWARD </p><p>TO A PHONE CALL WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON AS THE PRESS OF </p><p>BUSINESS AT CAMP DAVID PERMITS.  IN THAT CONVERSATION, </p><p>MANDELA IS LIKELY TO RAISE HIS CONCERN THAT "ANOTHER </p><p>COUNTRY" BESIDES SOUTH AFRICA PROVIDE SECURITY TO ENSURE </p><p>THE SAFETY OF THE LEADERS OF THE NINETEEN PARTIES </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE ARUSHA NEGOTIATIONS ON THEIR EVENTUAL </p><p>RETURN TO BURUNDI.  WOLPE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DEPUTY SPECIAL </p><p>ENVOY YELLIN, SPECIAL ADVISOR PRENDERGAST, AND A/CG LEONARD </p><p>(NOTETAKER.)  A FOLLOW-ON MEETING WITH ARUSHA FACILITATION </p><p>TEAM MEMBER NICHOLAS HAYSOM FURTHER CLARIFIED THE STATUS </p><p>OF A NEW DRAFT ARUSHA AGREEMENT AND PLANS FOR THE JULY </p><p>19/20 ARUSHA MEETING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) S/E WOLPE OPENED THE MEETING BY RELAYING A </p><p>MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT CLINTON IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>MANDELA\'S CONCERN ABOUT DELAYS IN DONOR FUNDING FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03963  01 OF 04  191357Z </p><p>THE ARUSHA PROCESS.  HE ASSURED MANDELA THAT $500,000 </p><p>HAD ALREADY ARRIVED IN TANZANIA, AND A FURTHER </p><p>$500,000 HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WOULD BE CONTRIBUTED </p><p>PENDING CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION.  FURTHER, WOLPE </p><p>TOLD MANDELA THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON LOOKS FORWARD TO </p><p>SPEAKING WITH HIM REGARDING BOTH THE MIDDLE EAST AND </p><p>BURUNDI, BUT THAT THE PRESS OF NEGOTIATIONS AT CAMP </p><p>DAVID HAD DELAYED THEIR CONVERSATION.  MANDELA REPLIED </p><p>THAT HE REALIZED THE U.S. PRESIDENT IS VERY BUSY AT </p><p>CAMP DAVID, AND HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH HIM </p><p>AT CLINTON\'S CONVENIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WOLPE THEN SUMMARIZED U.S. CONCERNS OVER THE </p><p>BURUNDI PEACE PROCESS, BORN OF U.S. EXPERIENCES IN </p><p>SIERRA LEONE AND THE ARUSHA PROCESS FOR RWANDA, AND </p><p>SOLICITED MANDELA\'S VIEWS.  IN BOTH THESE CASES, </p><p>AGREEMENTS TURNED OUT TO BE UNSUSTAINABLE.  THESE TWO </p><p>CASES ALSO RAISED DIFFICULT ISSUES SIMILAR TO THOSE </p><p>PRESENT IN BURUNDI: ISSUES OF JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, </p><p>AND THE IMPORTANCE OF KEY PLAYERS OWNING THE FINAL </p><p>NEGOTIATED OUTCOME.  WOLPE CAUTIONED THAT THE U.S. </p><p>IS HEARING NERVOUSNESS FROM ALL SIDES IN BURUNDI </p><p>THAT KEY QUESTIONS (COMPOSITION OF THE MILITARY, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE) HAVE NOT YET BEEN BROUGHT TO CLOSURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AT THE SAME TIME, WOLPE UNDERSCORED TO MANDELA </p><p>THE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAD </p><p>MADE AS A FACILITATOR FOR BURUNDI.  HAVING BEEN </p><p>ENGAGED IN THE BURUNDI PROCESS SINCE 1996, WOLPE </p><p>WITNESSED TWO TO THREE WASTED YEARS DUE TO POOR </p><p>FACILITATION AND MISTRUST OF TANZANIA\'S ROLE. WOLPE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03963  01 OF 04  191357Z </p><p>REMINDED MANDELA THAT NOT SO MANY YEARS AGO </p><p>BURUNDIANS HAD SO DEMONIZED ONE ANOTHER AS MURDERS AND </p><p>GENOCIDAIRES THAT IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE THE PARTIES NOW </p><p>AT ARUSHA COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE SAME ROOM.  WOLPE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT CONVERSATION ON THE CORE ISSUES HAD ONLY </p><p>BEGUN WITH MANDELA\'S PARTICIPATION, WHICH GAVE BURUNDIANS </p><p>THE FIRST REAL CONFIDENCE THAT AGREEMENT AT ARUSHA IS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  WOLPE FOUND IT NOTHING SHORT OF REMARKABLE </p><p>THAT THE PARTIES ARE NOT ONLY NOW TALKING TOGETHER, BUT </p><p>ADDRESSING THE MOST SERIOUS QUESTIONS SUCH AS JUSTICE, </p><p>THE COMPOSITION OF THE ARMY, AND TRANSITIONAL LEADERSHIP. </p><p>CURRENTLY, BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS REALIZE </p><p>THAT THESE ISSUES ARE NOT YET RESOLVED, BUT THAT A </p><p>SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE.  THUS, WHILE MANDELA\'S EFFORTS HAVE </p><p>BROUGHT HUGE ADVANCES, TOO PRECIPITOUS A MOVE TOWARD SIGNING </p><p>AN AGREEMENT WOULD RISK SNATCHING DEFEAT FROM THE JAWS </p><p>OF VICTORY.  WOLPE CONCLUDED THAT THE PARTIES, AND IN </p><p>PARTICULAR THE REBELS, MUST BE GIVEN TIME TO DIGEST </p><p>AND GAIN OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PROPOSALS AS 50/50 </p><p>TUTSI/HUTU PARTICIPATION IN THE MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6417 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03963  02 OF 04  191358Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CCO-00   TEDE-00  IO-00    OIC-02   PM-00    P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    PMB-00   SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------7001FC  191358Z /45 </p><p>O 191250Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6651 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 003963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR A/S RICE AND PDAS POWELL </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 7/19/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BY, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE\'S MEETING WITH FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT MANDELA </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MANDELA RESPONDED WITH AN OUTLINE OF HIS GAME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03963  02 OF 04  191358Z </p><p>PLAN FOR THE AGREEMENT.  THE FACILITATION TEAM </p><p>CIRCULATED DRAFT COMPROMISE PROPOSALS FOR THE FIVE </p><p>COMMITTEES, WHICH WERE CIRCULATED AMONG THE 19 </p><p>PARTIES.  DURING THE THREE-WEEK-PLUS EXAMINATION </p><p>PERIOD, MANDELA MET, CONFIDENTIALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY, </p><p>AS WELL AS IN PLENARY, WITH ALL NINETEEN OF THE </p><p>PARTIES.  HE SECURED THE AGREEMENT OF EACH THAT THE </p><p>FINAL PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE DEVELOPED, BASED ON THE </p><p>VARIOUS PARTIES\' COMMENTS ON THE DRAFTS, WOULD BE </p><p>ACCEPTED WITHOUT FURTHER NEGOTIATION OR RECLAMA. THIS </p><p>WAS ESSENTIAL, IN MANDELA\'S VIEW, BECAUSE WITH SO </p><p>LITTLE PROGRESS SINCE 1995, ANY NEW COMMENT PERIOD </p><p>WOULD REOPEN A PANDORA\'S BOX OF ISSUES THAT WOULD </p><p>BLOCK ANY SUCCESSFUL AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) UNFORTUNATELY, MANDELA SAID, THE FACILITATION </p><p>TEAM HAD NOT YET COMPLETED ITS WORK TURNING ALL THE </p><p>DRAFT PROPOSALS WITH COMMENTS INTO FINAL FORM, WITH </p><p>THE QUESTIONS OF A CEASE-FIRE AND THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>PROVISIONAL INTERIM GOVERNMENT PARTICULARLY </p><p>OUTSTANDING.  HE SAID THAT HE WOULD NEVERTHELESS NOT </p><p>CANCEL THE HEADS OF STATE MEETING JULY 19-20, BUT </p><p>WOULD INSTEAD BRIEF THE REGIONAL LEADERS ON THE </p><p>PARTIES\' AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE, AND INFORM THEM THAT </p><p>THE ACTUAL SIGNING WOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL AUGUST 28. </p><p>(NOTE: MANDELA EXPECTS ATTENDANCE AT THE JULY MEETING </p><p>BY THE HEADS OF STATE OF MALI, GHANA, SWAZILAND, BOTSWANA, </p><p>MALAWI, LESOTHO, AND "OF COURSE, GADAFFI," OF LIBYA.) </p><p>MANDELA ADDED THAT HE HAD COUNSELED COMMITTEE NUMBER </p><p>THREE (THE COMMITTEE ON THE CEASE-FIRE AND SECURITY) </p><p>NOT TO INSIST ON A FORMAL REBEL CEASE-FIRE (AS DISTINCT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03963  02 OF 04  191358Z </p><p>FROM A CONFIDENCE-BUILDING SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES) </p><p>UNTIL AN ARUSHA AGREEMENT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED.  MANDELA </p><p>ALSO COMMENTED THAT THE STUMBLING BLOCK ON PROVISIONAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP IS THAT EVERY SINGLE PARTY IS VYING TO LEAD </p><p>THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) MANDELA FURTHER SUMMARIZED THE PARTIES\' VIEWS </p><p>BY SAYING THAT BUYOYA HAD ALREADY AGREED TO THE 50/50 </p><p>ARMY COMPOSITION CONCEPT, AND TO DISMANTLE REGROUPMENT </p><p>CAMPS BY JULY 31.  HE CRITICIZED THE BURUNDIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S ADAMANT VIEW OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AS A </p><p>"SENSITIVE ISSUE."  MANDELA RECOUNTED HIS HORROR ON </p><p>TOURING THAT COUNTRY\'S PRISONS ON JUNE 12, DISCOVERING </p><p>INMATES LIVING IN FILTH FOR CRIMES SUCH AS BOMBING A </p><p>HOUSE.  AS WAS THE CASE IN SOUTH AFRICA, MANDELA </p><p>CONTINUED, THERE CAN BE NO SETTLEMENT IN BURUNDI AS </p><p>LONG AS POLITICAL PRISONERS REMAIN IN JAIL; THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, ENFORCING INTERNATIONALLY </p><p>ACCEPTED DEFINITIONS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, SHOULD </p><p>PRESSURE BUYOYA TO RELEASE THEM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) REACTING TO MANDELA\'S COMMENTS, WOLPE </p><p>ADDRESSED THREE TOPICS: THE POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER </p><p>COMMENT ON THE FINAL DRAFT AGREEMENT; THE TIMING OF A </p><p>CEASE-FIRE; AND THE PROFILE OF PRISONERS IN BURUNDI. </p><p>RETURNING TO HIS PREVIOUS PRAISE OF MANDELA\'S </p><p>INVALUABLE ROLE AS A THIRD PARTY TO FORWARD A </p><p>COMPROMISE PROPOSAL, AND U.S. CONCERNS FOR THE </p><p>UNSUSTAINABILITY OF INCOMPLETE AGREEMENTS, WOLPE </p><p>QUERIED WHETHER THE JULY 19-20 MEETING COULD NOT BE </p><p>USED TO RESOLVE REMAINING OUTSTANDING ISSUES.  MANDELA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03963  02 OF 04  191358Z </p><p>VEHEMENTLY DISAGREED, REITERATING THAT THE PARTIES HAD </p><p>ALREADY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT, AND ANY </p><p>REOPENING WOULD TORPEDO AN AGREEMENT.  THE JULY </p><p>MEETING WOULD PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE </p><p>PARTIES THE FINAL DRAFT, NOT TO START OVER.  THEY WOULD </p><p>BE GIVEN TIME TO DIGEST THE FINAL DOCUMENT, BUT WOULD </p><p>NOT BE ABLE TO AMEND IT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ON THE SUBJECT OF THE CEASE-FIRE, MANDELA HAD </p><p>IN HIS PRESENTATION DRAWN COMPARISONS FROM SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA\'S EXPERIENCE.  MANDELA HAD ONCE HESITATED TO </p><p>AGREE TO SUSPEND THE ANC\'S ARMED STRUGGLE, WHICH HE </p><p>SAW AS HIS MOVEMENT\'S MAJOR TRUMP CARD IN THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  EVENTUALLY, HOWEVER, HE ACCEPTED THE </p><p>ARGUMENT THAT DE KLERK NEEDED TO DEMONSTRATE PROGRESS </p><p>TO HIS SUPPORTERS, AND SO MANDELA AGREED TO A </p><p>"SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES" -- NOT A FORMAL CEASE-FIRE -- </p><p>IN ORDER TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR SERIOUS NEGOTIATION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WOLPE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE REBELS NEEDED TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6422 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03963  03 OF 04  191359Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CCO-00   TEDE-00  IO-00    OIC-02   PM-00    P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    PMB-00   SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------700219  191359Z /45 </p><p>O 191250Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6652 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 003963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR A/S RICE AND PDAS POWELL </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 7/19/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BY, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE\'S MEETING WITH FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT MANDELA </p><p> </p><p>HAVE CONCESSIONS IN HAND BEFORE THEY COULD BE EXPECTED TO </p><p>LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS.  AT THE SAME TIME, WOLPE CAUTIONED, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03963  03 OF 04  191359Z </p><p>INSISTING THAT THE GOVERNMENT SIGN AN AGREEMENT WHILE THE </p><p>REBELS CONTINUED TO PROSECUTE THE WAR COULD PUT THE LIVES </p><p>OF THOSE SEEN AS GIVING UP TOO MUCH IN THE FACE OF CONTINUING </p><p>VIOLENCE.  WOLPE STRESSED THE NEED FOR SOME SPACE BETWEEN THE </p><p>AGREEMENT AND ITS FORMAL SIGNING TO GIVE THE REBELS A CHANCE </p><p>TO SHOW GOOD FAITH.  MANDELA UNDERSTOOD THE CONCERN, BUT HE </p><p>ADVOCATED AN ALTERNATIVE REMEDY: TO COUNSEL THE REBELS TO </p><p>MAKE A STATEMENT NOW THAT THEY WILL IMPLEMENT A CEASE FIRE </p><p>IMMEDIATELY ON SIGNING AN AGREEMENT.  IN THE ENSUING </p><p>CONVERSATION MANDELA APPEARED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS </p><p>NOT CLEAR ALL FIGHTERS HAVE YET COME FORWARD TO JOIN THE </p><p>ARUSHA PROCESS, OR THAT ALL REBEL LEADERS (JEAN BOSCO, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE) EXERT THE DEGREE OF CONTROL THEY CLAIM. WOLPE </p><p>COMMENTED THAT FORCING A SIGNATURE IF SUCH ISSUES WERE NOT </p><p>CLEARLY RESOLVED COULD PUT MANY PEOPLE AT RISK, PARTICULARLY </p><p>SINCE THE CONGO WAR PROVIDES A READY ESCAPE HATCH FOR </p><p>BURUNDIAN REBELS.  MANDELA AGREED THAT THIS WAS TRUE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) WOLPE THEN BROACHED THE SUBJECT OF </p><p>POLITICAL PRISONERS, DESCRIBING THE ISSUE AS VERY </p><p>COMPLICATED.  WHILE IT WAS CLEAR, WOLPE SAID, THAT </p><p>BURUNDIAN PRISONERS LIVED IN INTOLERABLE CONDITIONS AND </p><p>THAT MOST HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED DUE PROCESS, THE </p><p>DEFINITIONAL ISSUE WAS COMPLICATED.  RECALLING THE 1993 </p><p>DEATHS OF SOME 150,000 BURUNDIANS IN HUTU MASSACRES OF </p><p>TUTSI AND TUTSI ARMY REPRISALS AGAINST HUTU, HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE UNITED NATIONS CALLED MANY OF THESE KILLINGS </p><p>"ACTS OF GENOCIDE."  WHILE THE UN MAY HAVE ERRED IN </p><p>APPLYING THIS LABEL, THIS TERMINOLOGY IS NOW VERY MUCH </p><p>A PART OF THE BURUNDIAN POLITICAL CULTURE AND DEBATE. IN </p><p>POINT OF FACT, WOLPE SAID, MANY BURUNDIAN PRISONERS ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03963  03 OF 04  191359Z </p><p>NOT INCARCERATED MERELY FOR POLITICALLY-INSPIRED ACTS </p><p>OF VIOLENCE, BUT FOR ETHNICALLY INSPIRED KILLINGS.  THE </p><p>QUESTION OF HOW TO GIVE BOTH HUTUS AND TUTSIS COMFORT </p><p>AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FOR THESE ACTS IS VERY IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) IN OTHER TOPICS, MANDELA DEMONSTRATED HIS </p><p>APPRECIATION OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE POST-ACCORD ERA. </p><p>HE SAID HE HAD SECURED FRENCH PRESIDENT CHIRAC\'S </p><p>AGREEMENT TO HOST AN INTERNATIONAL DONORS\' CONFERENCE </p><p>TO HELP REORIENT BURUNDI\'S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY TO </p><p>JOB-CREATING INDUSTRY. MANDELA WILL ALSO ASK COUNTRIES-- </p><p>INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES--TO ACCEPT BURUNDIAN </p><p>STUDENTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION, TO BEGIN REDRESSING THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S SKILLS DEFICIT.  WOLPE AGREED THAT THESE </p><p>SUGGESTIONS ARE USEFUL IN FOCUSSING THE PARTIES\' </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE NEED AND VALUE OF SECURING A PEACE, </p><p>AND IN GIVING BURUNDIANS NEW HOPE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) MANDELA ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE PROCESS BY </p><p>WHICH THE BURUNDIAN PEOPLE, THE ULTIMATE ARBITERS OF </p><p>ANY ACCORD, WOULD ACCEPT THE RESULTS NEGOTIATED BY THE </p><p>VARIOUS PARTIES.  CLEARLY, PARTY REPRESENTATIVES AND </p><p>THE REBELS MUST EVENTUALLY RETURN TO BURUNDI TO DEFEND </p><p>THE OUTCOME OF THE AGREEMENT.  THIS COULD BE A </p><p>DANGEROUS PROCESS FOR THE LEADERS CONCERNED, AND </p><p>MANDELA HAD ASKED UN SECRETARY GENERAL KOFFI ANNAN FOR </p><p>UNITED NATIONS BODYGUARDS FOR EACH PARTY.  RECOGNIZING </p><p>THE UN WOULD INEVITABLY BE SLOW TO RESPOND, MANDELA </p><p>SAID HE INTENDED TO ASK SOME OTHER COUNTRY TO PROVIDE </p><p>THAT SERVICE, SINCE SENDING SOUTH AFRICANS WOULD </p><p>APPEAR TOO FORWARD ON MANDELA\'S PART. MANDELA FELT HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03963  03 OF 04  191359Z </p><p>MUST DISCUSS THIS ISSUE WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) COMMENT: WHILE WOLPE\'S MEETING ELICITED NO </p><p>CLEAR PLEDGE TO ABANDON A SET SIGNING DATE, THE </p><p>DISCUSSION DID BRING ABOUT SEVERAL IMPORTANT OPENINGS. </p><p>MANDELA CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD OUR FOCUS ON THE DANGER OF </p><p>PREMATURE SIGNATURE WITH REMAINING UNRESOLVED ISSUES, </p><p>NAMELY THAT SUCH AN ACTION COULD COST LIVES.  AS FOR </p><p>MANDELA\'S PROTESTATIONS ABOUT THE FINALITY OF THE </p><p>REVISED AGREEMENT, WORKING COMMITTEE CHAIR (AND </p><p>MANDELA ADVISOR) NICHOLAS HAYSOM LATER CLARIFIED </p><p>THAT HE IS INTERACTING WITH VARIOUS PARTIES TO SHARE </p><p>THE EARLY DRAFT OF THE FINAL PROPOSAL, AND THAT THERE </p><p>REMAINS "SPACE FOR FURTHER INTERACTION." AT THE END </p><p>OF THE CONVERSATION, MANDELA ACTUALLY VERBALIZED THE </p><p>NEED FOR A "CEASE FIRE BEFORE SIGNING," BUT U.S. </p><p>PARTICIPANTS UNDERSTOOD, AND NICHOLAS HAYSOM\'S </p><p>SUBSEQUENT COMMENTS SUPPORTED, THAT MANDELA PROBABLY </p><p>ACTUALLY REFERRED TO AN ADVANCE ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN </p><p>AGREED CEASE-FIRE THAT WOULD TRIGGER IMMEDIATELY ON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6429 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03963  04 OF 04  191359Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CCO-00   TEDE-00  IO-00    OIC-02   PM-00    P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    PMB-00   SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------700235  191359Z /45 </p><p>O 191250Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6653 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 04 HARARE 003963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR A/S RICE AND PDAS POWELL </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 7/19/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BY, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE\'S MEETING WITH FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT MANDELA </p><p> </p><p>SIGNING.  (NOTE: HE MAY ALSO HAVE MEANT A SUSPENSION OF </p><p>HOSTILITIES BEFORE SIGNATURE, SOMETHING HE IS SEEKING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03963  04 OF 04  191359Z </p><p>FROM THE TWO REBEL GROUPS. END NOTE.)  MANDELA IS ALSO </p><p>CLEARLY AWARE THAT THE SELECTION OF TRANSITIONAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP IS BOTH DIFFICULT AND UNRESOLVED.  HAYSOM SAID </p><p>MANDELA\'S POSITION IS THAT THE SIGNING MUST NOT BE HELD </p><p>UP WHILE A LEADER IS SELECTED, PARTICULARLY SINCE MANDELA </p><p>FEELS IT IS NOT HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHOOSE AN INTERIM </p><p>LEADER; HOWEVER, SEVERAL PARTIES DO NOT WANT TO SIGN </p><p>WITHOUT RESOLVING THIS ISSUE.  HAYSOM FELT ONE ACCEPTABLE </p><p>COMPROMISE WOULD BE FOR CURRENT PRESIDENT BUYOYA TO </p><p>GOVERN THE SIX MONTH IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD IN A DEPARTING </p><p>EXERCISE OF GOVERNMENT CIVILIANIZATION BEFORE THE </p><p>TRANSITION ACTUALLY BEGINS.  FINALLY, MANDELA APPARENTLY </p><p>TOOK WOLPE\'S DISCUSSION OF THE NEED TO DISTINGUISH </p><p>BETWEEN DIFFERING CATEGORIES OF BURUNDIAN PRISONERS </p><p>ON BOARD. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) MANDELA AND WOLPE PARTED BY OBSERVING THAT </p><p>THE PROCESS IS GOING FORWARD, AND THAT THEY WOULD WORK </p><p>TOGETHER IN ARUSHA LATER THIS WEEK TO FURTHER THAT </p><p>END.
