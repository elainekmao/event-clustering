<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 002189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  CABINET EXPANSION </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1931 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  The interim Government of Prime Minister Lokendra </p><p>Bahadur Chand announced an expansion of its 9-member Cabinet </p><p>to 22 on November 18.  The new names included no one from </p><p>either of the two largest political parties, the Nepali </p><p>Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (UML), and only one representative from the third </p><p>largest party, the National Democratic Party, also known by </p><p>its Nepali acronym RPP.  The additions contain a similar mix </p><p>of former supporters of the partyless Panchayat regime, </p><p>members of small or new parties not represented in the </p><p>previous Parliament, and technocrats apparent in the first </p><p>batch of appointments on October 11.  Of the 13 new names, </p><p>one is a member of the lowest caste, and two are members of </p><p>ethnic minorities.  The Chand Cabinet now boasts 15 full </p><p>ministers and 7 Assistant Ministers. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  A list of the new ministers follows below.  (Note: </p><p> Names of the Assistant Ministers will be sent septel.) </p><p> </p><p>A)  Ramesh Nath Pandey - Minister of Information and </p><p>Communications and General Administration.  A former </p><p>journalist, Mr. Pandey was a minister during the Panchayat </p><p>regime.  He was a member of the National Assembly (the Upper </p><p>House) in the previous Parliament, appointed by the King. </p><p> </p><p>B) Devi Prasad Ojha - Minister of Education and Sports.  Mr. </p><p>Ojha left the Communist Party of Nepal - Marxist Leninist </p><p>(ML) when it merged with the UML earlier this year.  He is no </p><p>longer affiliated with any political party. </p><p> </p><p>C)  Narayan Singh Pun - A retired Army officer, Col. Pun is a </p><p>successful businessman who owns his own helicopter company. </p><p>A Nepali Congress MP in the previous Parliament, Mr. Pun left </p><p>the NC to form his own party, the Nepal Equality Party, to </p><p>contest now-deferred national elections.  The Nepal Equality </p><p>Party platforms focuses on equal opportunity for members of </p><p>all ethnic groups, castes and religion.  Mr. Pun is a </p><p>Magar--the ethnic group believed to constitute the bulk of </p><p>Maoist foot soldiers. </p><p> </p><p>D) Badri Narayan Basnet - Minister of Land Reforms and </p><p>Management and Forest and Soil Conservation.  Mr. Basnet is a </p><p>member of the National Democratic Party\'s Central Committee. </p><p>He had been a minister during the Panchayat era. </p><p> </p><p>E)  Kamal Prasad Chaulagain - Minister of Labor and Transport </p><p>Management.  A former member of the UML\'s Central Committee, </p><p>Mr. Chaulagain resigned from the party just one week before </p><p>being named to Chand\'s Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>F)  Kuber Sharma - Minister of Culture, Tourism, and Civil </p><p>Aviation.  A former member of the Nepali Congress Central </p><p>Committee, Mr. Sharma now heads his own "Green Nepal" party </p><p>focusing on environmental issues. </p><p> </p><p>G)  Mahesh Lal Pradhan - Minister of Industry, Commerce and </p><p>Supplies.  A former president of the federated Nepali </p><p>Chambers of Commerce, Mr. Pradhan is a businessman. </p><p> </p><p>H)  Deepak Gyawali - Minister of Water Resources.  Mr. </p><p>Gyawali is a well-respected intellectual, writer and </p><p>consultant active in the field of water resources, known for </p><p>his sometimes iconoclastic views. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment:  The absence of any names from the two </p><p>largest parties--and the addition of only one from the Prime </p><p>Minister\'s own RPP party--indicates that the Chand government </p><p>continues to face an uphill battle in garnering mainstream </p><p>political support.  Without broadbased political support, the </p><p>new government--despite the impeccable credentials of some of </p><p>its appointees--may find the task of governing increasingly </p><p>difficult. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
