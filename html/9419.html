We blieve this corporation is </p><p>deserving of the award for its outstanding demonstration of </p><p>corporate citizenship, community development, and equal </p><p>employment practices.  Post offers the following responses to </p><p>ref b: </p><p> </p><p>A)  We are unaware of any possible downside or embarrassment </p><p>caused by the selection of Citibank, Banco de Honduras should </p><p>it be chosen. </p><p> </p><p>B)  Banco de Honduras receives administrative support from </p><p>Miami, and indirectly supports job creation in U.S. companies </p><p>that serve as clients. </p><p> </p><p>C)  Citibank, Banco de Honduras is a financial institution </p><p>which works with all US based companies located in Honduras, </p><p>providing various financial services and financing </p><p>development projects in Honduras which lead to increased U.S. </p><p>exports.  One current example is Citibank\'s syndication of </p><p>financing of a 210MW electricity generation project being </p><p>completed by a Honduran company.  The project is likely to </p><p>spur U.S. exports of both capital goods and services. </p><p> </p><p>D)  The labor conditions in the bank are considered </p><p>excellent.  There is a strong sense of teamwork within the </p><p>institution as many employees contribute time and personal </p><p>financial resources to Citibank, Banco de Honduras\' many </p><p>philanthropic activities (ref a).  The workers are not </p><p>unionized.  The compensation plan is extremely competitive </p><p>for the local market. </p><p> </p><p>2.
