<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA, SA/INS, EAP/CM, DRL-A/S CRANER, AND PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, CH, NP, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: FUTURE OF TIBETAN REFUGEES IN NEPAL REMAINS </p><p>UNCERTAIN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) BEIJING 6004 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0998 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) PolOffs met June 3 with Wangchuk Tsering, Office of </p><p>Tibet and Official Representative of the Dalai Lama in Nepal </p><p>to discuss the status of Tibeten refugees in Nepal, after the </p><p>May 30 deportation described Ref B.  Tsering said he </p><p>appreciated USG efforts to delay the deportation of the 18 </p><p>refugees as well as the Embassy\'s June 2 press release </p><p>deploring Government of Nepal\'s (GON) actions. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Tsering admitted that one of the 18 refugees had been </p><p>engaged in political activism in Tibet, for which he had been </p><p>arrested three separate times in China.  A different source </p><p>close to the Tibetan community reported that three others of </p><p>the 18 refugees, including the guide, were suspected by other </p><p>Tibetans of criminal activity in Tibet. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The fate of the three Tibetan refugee children (two </p><p>age 6 and one age 9), now under UNHCR\'s custody at the </p><p>reception center in Kathmandu, remains uncertain.  Tsering </p><p>reported that the UNHCR has not requested exit visas for the </p><p>children from the GON for fear that the Immigration Service\'s </p><p>standing request to hand the children over would be renewed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Tsering said he fears that the deportation of </p><p>organized groups, such as this one coming from Lhasa, will </p><p>dampen the flow of refugees, at least until the GON proves it </p><p>has returned to its previous policy of allowing refugees to </p><p>transit to India.  Because of the Office of Tibet\'s fears </p><p>that the GON will seize and arrest refugees for immigration </p><p>violations, Tsering confided that he has not bothered to </p><p>inform UNHCR of the few Tibetans who have made it across the </p><p>border since the May 30 incident because he believes it </p><p>unlikely the GON would grant them exit permits. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  Because of the diplomatic outcry in response </p><p>to the GON\'s deportation of the 18 refugees, it is unlikely </p><p>the GON will force UNHCR to hand over the three child </p><p>refugees to the immigration authorities.  However, the </p><p>fall-out of this incident on the flow of refugees from Tibet </p><p>may be significant as fears of deportation circulate in the </p><p>Tibetan refugee community.  Post will continue to impress </p><p>upon the GON the importance the U.S. and international </p><p>communities place on this issue.  Our ongoing effort to </p><p>arrange an appointment with the Home Ministry to discuss this </p><p>issue with senior officials has, so far, been denied.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
