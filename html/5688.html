<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000261 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS/DCAMP </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO USAID/ANE/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S INTERIM GOVERNMENT MOVES REFORM FORWARD </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A. KATHMANDU 25 </p><p>     B. B. 2002 KATHMANDU 2467 </p><p>     C. C. KATHMANDU 80 </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>1.  In the four months of its existence, Nepal\'s interim </p><p>government has begun important reforms to control corruption, </p><p>decentralize some government services, privatize ailing </p><p>industries, and improve accountability.  Although much </p><p>remains to be done, including establishing services in </p><p>conflict-affected areas of the country, these signs of </p><p>progress are encouraging indicators of improved governance in </p><p>certain key areas.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Interim Government Presses Reform Agenda </p><p>======================================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  When King Gyanendra appointed Lokendra Bahadur Chand as </p><p>Prime Minister, he specifically charged the PM with improving </p><p>governance in Nepal.  In the intervening four months, the </p><p>interim government has begun to meet the challenge and has </p><p>initiated reforms in government services with measurable </p><p>success in some areas and potential for long-term </p><p>improvements in others.  In recognition of the government\'s </p><p>reform efforts, the World Bank doubled Nepal\'s annual lending </p><p>profile from low-case (eligible for USD 50 million in new </p><p>loans) to base-case (eligible for USD 100 million in new </p><p>loans) (Ref. A).  The following provides an overview of </p><p>several of the reforms that address long-held barriers to </p><p>good governance in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>Anti-Corruption Drive </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>3.  Amendments to the constitution that were passed by the </p><p>previous government strengthening the central anti-corruption </p><p>agency, the Commission for the Investigation of the Abuse of </p><p>Authority (CIAA), have resulted under the interim government </p><p>in high-profile arrests and investigations. Most notably, the </p><p>CIAA charged two of the most powerful ministers in the former </p><p>government with steering contracts to political allies and </p><p>amassing wealth beyond their means(Ref B).  A third former </p><p>minister remains under investigation.  In an effort to root </p><p>out petty corruption, the Judicial Investigation of Property </p><p>Commission (JIPC) is evaluating the property and incomes of </p><p>83,000 current government officials (appointees, civil </p><p>service, police, and military) and will deliver its results </p><p>in May 2003.  The results of JIPC\'s investigation likely will </p><p>result in another series of arrests by the CIAA.  Surveys of </p><p>corruption in Nepal have insufficient data to evaluate the </p><p>impact of the Government\'s efforts thus far (Ref C). </p><p>However, business contacts have commented repeatedly on the </p><p>decline of bribe requests. </p><p> </p><p>Government Service Decentralization </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  Schools.  Nepali parents, especially in remote locations, </p><p>have long complained of chronic absenteeism on the part of </p><p>teachers assigned to these less desirable school districts. </p><p>The Ministry of Education is moving forward with devolving </p><p>26,000 public schools to local management by 2007.  School </p><p>management will be undertaken by local School Management </p><p>Committees, a body of parents and teachers, which will have </p><p>the authority to hire/fire teachers, direct school funds, and </p><p>hold public school officials accountable.  The Ministry in </p><p>Kathmandu will be limited to curriculum planning, teacher </p><p>training, and monitoring.  Local publication of the school\'s </p><p>budget is also under discussion. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Health.  Similar to school reform, rural health </p><p>infrastructure will be turned over to Village and District </p><p>Development Committees to make service providers responsive </p><p>to the needs of the communities in which they serve.  The </p><p>local committees will monitor whether the health employees </p><p>work at the health posts on their assigned days, and whether </p><p>the requisite medical supplies are kept in inventory (rather </p><p>than being sold on the black market).  Also under Government </p><p>consideration are plans from the Health Ministry to develop </p><p>mobile health teams to serve people in Maoist-controlled </p><p>areas. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Energy.  To combat theft and low collection rates and </p><p>improve service delivery, the Nepal Electricity Authority </p><p>established eighteen electricity distribution centers across </p><p>the country.  Currently, 24 percent of Nepal\'s energy is lost </p><p>to pilferage, costing the Government millions of dollars </p><p>annually and driving up electricity rates.  The establishment </p><p>of these semi-autonomous units eliminates layers of </p><p>bureaucratic control held by Kathmandu, which will now </p><p>monitor performance indicators and focus on infrastructure </p><p>planning. </p><p> </p><p>Privatization </p><p>============= </p><p> </p><p>7.  In January, the Government of Nepal sold the </p><p>government-owned Butwal Power Company (BPC) to a </p><p>Norwegian-Nepali joint venture for USD 12 million in what is </p><p>hailed in Nepal as its most successful privatization effort. </p><p>BPC runs two hydro-electric projects, producing 17.1 </p><p>megawatts, and holds 15 percent of the 60 megawatt Khimti </p><p>hydro-project.  The privatization effort had been bogged down </p><p>in bureaucratic limbo for four years, amid charges that </p><p>vested interests--in the shape of a powerful local </p><p>businssman--impeded the sale.  The sale should strengthen </p><p>foreign investor confidence in Nepal and demonstrates the </p><p>Government\'s commitment to privatize sensitive infrastructure </p><p>holdings.  The sale of BPC is the first clear success in </p><p>Nepal\'s history of privatization and should serve to </p><p>encourage similar efforts. </p><p> </p><p>Improvements in Government Service Accountability </p><p>============================================= ==== </p><p> </p><p>8.  In November 2002, the interim Cabinet established a </p><p>National Vigilance Center to assist in corruption control and </p><p>improve delivery of government services.  One of the Center\'s </p><p>first acts was to require the posting of fees and procedures </p><p>at government offices to dissuade civil servants from taking </p><p>advantage of their customers.  Offices were also to post the </p><p>contact information for the Center in an effort hold them </p><p>accountable.  No information on the success of this endeavor </p><p>has yet been officially reported.  However, anecdotes from </p><p>users indicate a responsive approach to phoned complaints and </p><p>prompt written replies to the complainant.  In one case, a </p><p>foreign businessman operating in rural Nepal complained of </p><p>mistreatment at the hands of the Royal Nepal Army.  Within </p><p>three weeks of filing his complaint, he had a written apology </p><p>from the Secretary at the Ministry of Defense and a personal </p><p>apology from the regional military commander.  More examples </p><p>will be required to call the National Vigilance Center a </p><p>success. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>9.  The lack of political stability since the restoration of </p><p>democracy in 1990, as reflected in the rapid succession of </p><p>thirteen governments in as many years, has admittedly been </p><p>the single greatest impediment to greater progress on several </p><p>fronts critical to Nepal\'s socio-economic development.  That </p><p>said, the four-mounth old government has made an encouraging </p><p>start.  Nepalis cite corruption as the principal source of </p><p>their disenchantment with successive democratic governments </p><p>since 1990.  That the interim government is attacking the </p><p>problem with vigor--especially by focusing on high-profile, </p><p>influential individuals long believed to be above the </p><p>law--will be an important step toward restoring public </p><p>confidence.  Despite political opposition, Maoist violence, </p><p>and waivering international support, the interim Government </p><p>has made some progress toward delivering good governance. </p><p>Much remains to be done to broaden the reform drive and </p><p>deepen the efforts already begun.  Ultimately, the interim </p><p>Cabinet\'s progress must be measured by the provision or </p><p>restoration of services to Nepal\'s conflict areas. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
