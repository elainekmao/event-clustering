<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HO CHI MINH CITY 000466 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR ECA (P.HARRISON); ECA/A (T. FARRELL); EAP/PD </p><p>(P.KOVACH/D. MONK); EAP/BCLTV (J.STROTZ/C.JESS) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OEXC, SCUL, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: KEEPING THE LID ON FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND </p><p>ARTISTIC EXPRESSION IN HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HCMC 0342  B) 02 HCMC 1170   C) HCMC 0156 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Despite a flurry of economic reforms and </p><p>trade liberalization heralded by the signing of the </p><p>Bilateral Trade Agreement over a year ago, Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City\'s press reporting and cultural programs remain mired </p><p>in self-censorship, media "guidelines" and an arbitrary </p><p>permit process that strongly limit the freedom of </p><p>expression for thoughtful writers, journalists, moviemakers </p><p>and theater directors.  During the past 15 months, as Post </p><p>has sponsored its first live cultural performances and </p><p>broadened its contacts within media organizations and the </p><p>artistic community, we too have experienced the gauntlet of </p><p>obstacles created by groups of small-minded ideologues. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>NEWS MEDIA: WE KNOW THE TRUTH, WE JUST CAN\'T TELL IT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>2.  (U) Ho Chi Minh City TV (HTV) is government-owned and </p><p>the only local TV station in HCMC.  Domestic news programs </p><p>follow a time-honored tradition of airing mostly positive </p><p>stories about courtesy calls, government-organized seminars </p><p>and conferences, and visiting dignitaries.  World news </p><p>visual coverage has generally been fairly open, drawing on </p><p>BBC, CNN and other news services.  However, there is no </p><p>guarantee that the Vietnamese voiceover will bear any </p><p>relationship to what the viewer sees on the TV screen. </p><p>Coverage of the war in Iraq was one-sided.  There was no </p><p>reporting about Iraqis celebrating Saddam\'s fall or </p><p>toppling statues of him, let alone welcoming the coalition </p><p>forces.  Entertainment programs are of fair quality for a </p><p>developing country, but lack anything approaching </p><p>contemporary political satire or serious talk shows about </p><p>sensitive issues. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Like the rest of Vietnam, the press in HCMC has </p><p>ownership roots in the local government or Communist Party. </p><p>A handful of the city\'s numerous newspapers and magazines </p><p>are considered serious news sources.  They must adhere to </p><p>unwritten guidelines, avoiding criticism of the government </p><p>and the Party except in particular cases, such as certain </p><p>corruption trials. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) A vivid example is the recent dismissal of the </p><p>editor-in-chief of the "Tuoi Tre" newspaper, Mr. Le Van </p><p>Nui.  "Tuoi Tre" is owned by the Youth Union of HCMC, a </p><p>government-sanctioned mass organization.  Mr. Nui had been </p><p>under a cloud of suspicion ever since his paper published a </p><p>poll during President Clinton\'s visit in 2000.  This poll </p><p>asked readers to rate the leaders they most admired.  The </p><p>results showed that Mr. Clinton was more popular than Ho </p><p>Chi Minh.  Authorities stripped Mr. Nui of his press </p><p>association membership about a year ago, although he kept </p><p>his top position at the paper until this month.  Then "Tuoi </p><p>Tre\'s" focus on top GVN leaders implicated in a well- </p><p>publicized criminal trial (the "Nam Cam" case, which opened </p><p>this April) seemed to renew official interest in Mr. Nui\'s </p><p>departure.  He has been replaced by a local book publisher, </p><p>Mr. Le Hoang, who is respected for his business skills but </p><p>who has no journalism experience.  Mr. Nui, in the </p><p>meantime, has been sidelined into the directorship of Tuoi </p><p>Tre News Group\'s real estate and land management firm. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Coverage/commentary on the Iraq war in HCMC was </p><p>negative, with the daily press running graphic photos of </p><p>civilian casualties and editorial content focusing on the </p><p>"unwelcome American aggression."  Sources have told Post </p><p>that media editors received written guidelines on Iraq war </p><p>coverage.  Reporters and editors have said they know the </p><p>real story of the coalition\'s victory, but were forbidden </p><p>to report it. </p><p> </p><p>FILM: TREAD LIGHTLY </p><p>------------------- </p><p>6.  (SBU) The best-known recent case is the expulsion of </p><p>film star Don Duong from the actors\' union.  Technically, </p><p>he had violated a government rule for appearing in foreign </p><p>films: submitting the script in advance for approval.  Don </p><p>Duong and his family were subjected to police questioning </p><p>and harassment for his "betrayal of the homeland" in movies </p><p>such as "Green Dragon" (life in a Vietnamese refugee </p><p>resettlement camp in the U.S.) and "We Were Soldiers Once" </p><p>(a balanced portrayal of soldiers\' lives on both sides </p><p>during the early days of the Vietnam War).  Blackballed by </p><p>the film association, his children taunted and intimidated </p><p>at school, menacing phone calls, "invitations" to the local </p><p>police station, and vandalism at his sister\'s restaurant </p><p>finally drove Don Duong and his family to emigrate to the </p><p>U.S. (ref A).  The orchestrated media attacks and forced </p><p>unemployment were pointed reminders to his fellow actors: </p><p>stick to pure entertainment or politically correct drama. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Two recent screen releases have mildly criticized </p><p>the socio-cultural realities of contemporary Saigon.  "Gai </p><p>Nhay" ("Sensitive Girl"), a film about the exploitation of </p><p>bar girls, implicitly criticizes the poverty that drives </p><p>them to that lifestyle and the callousness of a system that </p><p>would create such an underclass.  Sex for drug money, heavy </p><p>drinking, and slimy nouveau riche Vietnamese are also </p><p>featured.  "Luoi Troi" ("Tangled in the Sky\'s Web") took </p><p>the Golden Kite prize at Vietnam\'s Film Festival this year. </p><p>It deals with the corruption of individual Party members </p><p>and hints at institutional flaws, but stops short of </p><p>explicitly criticizing the government.  It may have been a </p><p>critical success at the Film Festival, but its commercial </p><p>run has been much shorter than "Gai Nhay". </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The GVN recently moved to allow the establishment </p><p>of private film companies.  To say there has not been a mad </p><p>rush to take advantage of this "opening" would be an </p><p>understatement.  The start-up process for the first </p><p>company(ies) would likely be unpredictable and time- </p><p>consuming.  Post believes that any company brave enough to </p><p>wade through the application forms and obtain a license, </p><p>would certainly not risk losing its investment in order to </p><p>focus on social or political issues. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) In the words of one contact, media organizations </p><p>and the film industry may criticize "below the waist" </p><p>(lower-ranking members of the Party or government), but not </p><p>take aim at the head (national leaders, ideology etc.) </p><p> </p><p>STAGE: AS IN "ALL THE WORLD IS (NOT)" </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>10. (SBU) Serious theater in HCMC is virtually non- </p><p>existent.  The British Council sponsored a contemporary </p><p>version of "Romeo and Juliet" last year.  Street people </p><p>depicted actual characters, but the setting was blandly </p><p>anyplace.  (Post Note: Homelessness and abandonment are </p><p>increasing social problems in HCMC\'s growing metropolis of </p><p>8 million, but absent any specific country references, few </p><p>Vietnamese in the audience recognized the subtle message </p><p>here.  End note.)  Playwrights, theater directors and </p><p>actors practice self-censorship, since all performances </p><p>must be reviewed by a board of censors prior to the formal </p><p>opening.  Contacts tell us that if they wish to perform a </p><p>small play or dance performance that may have daring or </p><p>sensitive content, they simply call the performance "a </p><p>party" and the audience is by invitation only. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) One prominent artist was visited by the police </p><p>after leading a group of cultural performers to the U.S. </p><p>Another colleague on the trip had made disparaging remarks </p><p>about the Vietnamese Government, and so the nominal </p><p>"leader" was called to account.  Understandably rattled </p><p>that the GVN would hold an individual responsible for the </p><p>conduct of an entire group, this artist was about to give </p><p>up on ever traveling overseas again.  As months have </p><p>passed, it now looks as though this contact will be able to </p><p>resume international travel.  However, the avant-garde </p><p>performances this individual is noted for Q with no </p><p>political content Q are still under increased scrutiny. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) On the more humorous side, one traveling </p><p>Vietnamese artist has been quoted in the Western media as </p><p>saying that since his works are so sophisticated, they are </p><p>"beyond the comprehension" of the cultural censors, so they </p><p>don\'t come and interfere. </p><p> </p><p>MUSIC: VIETNAM\'S "BOB DYLAN" SILENCED </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>13.  (SBU) Pop singers tend not to have problems if they </p><p>pay the proper licensing fees (indexed very high for profit </p><p>events) and submit recordings of their music for review. </p><p>One prominent singer, however, faces frequent harassment </p><p>for his sexual orientation and for a well-known (by word of </p><p>mouth) denunciation of the GVN, which he made from a stage </p><p>in Hue several years ago. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) There are virtually no songs on HCMC Radio </p><p>(government controlled) with political overtones.  HCMC </p><p>Radio now bans a collection of songs by Trinh Cong Son, a </p><p>popular anti-war/anti-U.S. activist during the 1960s and </p><p>1970s, because listeners have been loosely interpreting his </p><p>lyrics to include repression under the current government. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) Classical music concerts by the Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>Symphony take place on the 9th of every month.  Post has </p><p>noted that performing excerpts from classical standards Q </p><p>including some excerpts from Bach/Mozart/Brahms requiems </p><p>and masses Q draws no particular attention. </p><p> </p><p>EXHIBITIONS:  DON\'T SHOW US WHAT WE DON\'T WANT TO SEE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>16.  (U) Photo and art exhibits with non-revolutionary or </p><p>non-liberation themes are rare.  In the spring 2002, a </p><p>British- sponsored photojournalism workshop had its exhibit </p><p>closed by the censors during the opening ceremony.  Several </p><p>photos which portrayed the nitty-gritty realism of street </p><p>life in HCMC were unacceptable to the culture censors. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) Post has been able to sponsor two exhibits </p><p>related to the September 11 terrorist attacks ("Headlines </p><p>of History" poster show in September 2002 and "9/11: View </p><p>from Ground Zero" in February 2003).  These required an </p><p>exhaustive searches for willing venues and a painstaking </p><p>effort to detail to the censors the contents of the </p><p>exhibits (photos, translations of each newspaper headline </p><p>and caption etc.).  Even then, whether or not our co- </p><p>sponsors would be issued the appropriate permits was in </p><p>doubt to the last minute.  So while we have nudged open the </p><p>door, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to arrange </p><p>exhibits relating to American democracy and civil rights. </p><p> </p><p>WHO ARE THE CULTURAL BRAINS AND BRAWN? </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>18.  (SBU) PA25, which is the cultural censorship branch of </p><p>the Ministry of Public Affairs ("the culture police"), is </p><p>often called into action.  In film actor Don Duong\'s case, </p><p>PA25 officers were the ones who brought him in for </p><p>questioning.  They tried to intimidate an apology and </p><p>confession out of him.  On a recent trip to the central </p><p>coast, when the People\'s Committee of Khanh Hoa Province </p><p>did not want the Consul General to meet with professors and </p><p>students at the local university, teachers\' training </p><p>college, and school of music and art, PA25 was dispatched </p><p>to tell at least one rector and his senior staff that they </p><p>"should find it inconvenient" to be available for the CG\'s </p><p>appointment.  Other confirmed interlocutors were suddenly </p><p>summoned by PA25 to a meeting at the People\'s Committee </p><p>just before the CG\'s scheduled arrival at their </p><p>institution.  On another occasion in Binh Thuan Province, </p><p>public security police and the People\'s Committee external </p><p>relations officer jointly tried to prevent the DPO from </p><p>visiting an ethnic Cham princess and her husband who run a </p><p>small tourist museum, claiming the DPO needed prior </p><p>"permission." </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU) The gatekeepers for HCMC\'s flow of information </p><p>and the performing and visual arts remain formidable.  The </p><p>local Department of Culture and Information, the Party </p><p>Commission on Ideology and Culture, the Peoples Aid </p><p>Committee and the Ministry of Public Security continue to </p><p>be narrow-minded, arbitrary and obstructionist when </p><p>deciding which artistic work should be disseminated through </p><p>the media, exhibitions, or live performances.  Post\'s own </p><p>Vietnamese co-sponsors for cultural performances have had </p><p>to submit the music and lyrics to the Department of Culture </p><p>and Information in order to get a permit for each event. </p><p>Post can only wonder.  Did these minders actually think we </p><p>would try to sneak in a non-revolutionary piano note? </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU) COMMENT: Post believes there is no big cultural </p><p>opening around the corner in southern Vietnam. Journalists </p><p>and editors Q perhaps because they have relatively better </p><p>access to sources and information Q are becoming more </p><p>inquisitive.  And there are certainly individuals in both </p><p>the media and the arts who follow their professional ethics </p><p>and conscience.  However, if they fall into the bad graces </p><p>of the powers-that-be (as in the case of film actor Don </p><p>Duong and newspaper editor Le Van Nui), they cannot count </p><p>on the support of colleagues who themselves can\'t afford to </p><p>be blacklisted or stripped of their accreditation.  Post </p><p>continues to build relations with journalists, artist, and </p><p>the cultural gatekeepers, looking for appropriate </p><p>candidates for the International Visitors program and other </p><p>exchange opportunities.  As we keep pushing at the door of </p><p>free expression, these programs will help carry them across </p><p>the threshold with us.  YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
