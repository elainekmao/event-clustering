President George W. Bush\'s visit to Africa remains a </p><p>      core issue for discussion in op-ed and opinion </p><p>      pieces being carried in some of the leading </p><p>      newspapers in Zimbabwe.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "U. S. seeks to strengthen its position </p><p>      in Africa" the government controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>      (07/18) carried the following op-ed by Chris Talbot: </p><p> </p><p>      "U. S. President Bush\'s African tour was something </p><p>      of a public relations debacle. . .His attempt to </p><p>      project a compassionate image was, to put mildly, </p><p>      less than convincing. . .If Bush hoped his visit </p><p>      would dispel the image of the U. S. as a </p><p>      warmongering bully, he was mistaken. . .Bush\'s Aids </p><p>      initiative is really about strengthening the U. S. </p><p>      position in Africa at the expense of imperialist </p><p>      rivals such as France and boosting the position of </p><p>      American-based corporations. . .The much-hyped Aids </p><p>      proposals are part of a bid to shoehorn U. S. </p><p>      corporations into Africa, oust foreign competitors </p><p>      and stamp out domestic enterprises. . .The U. S. </p><p>      initiative, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act </p><p>      (AGOA), which was touted by Bush throughout his </p><p>      visit, is part of the same unilateralist corporate </p><p>      agenda. . .The U. S. drive into Africa is not only </p><p>      economic.  It also involves establishing a much </p><p>      greater military presence under the guise of the war </p><p>      on terror.  This will give the U. S. control over </p><p>      key resources such as oil and provide it with a more </p><p>      rapid global reach. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Cowardly to expect Bush to liberate </p><p>      us" the independent daily "The Daily News" (07/18) carried </p><p>      the following opinion piece by Saul Gwakuba Ndhlovu, under </p><p>      his weekly column "A view from Matopos" published on page </p><p>      10: </p><p> </p><p>      "United States President George W. Bush\'s visit last </p><p>      week. . .generated a great deal of interest and </p><p>      raised expectations among Zimbabweans about his </p><p>      country\'s role in solving Zimbabwe\'s socio-political </p><p>      problems.  For quite a long time, many Zimbabweans </p><p>      have been praying and hoping that either the U. S. </p><p>      or Britain would intervene militarily in the country </p><p>      to remove the ZANU PF regime and replace it with a </p><p>      democratic government. . .(South African President </p><p>      Thabo) Mbeki has repeatedly publicly stated that </p><p>      South Africa would not intervene in Zimbabwean </p><p>      problems because they are an internal issue and </p><p>      thus, must be solved by Zimbabweans themselves. . </p><p>      .The cornerstone of the South African government\'s </p><p>      policy on Zimbabwe is simple: Zimbabweans must solve </p><p>      their own problems. . .Bust some Zimbabweans still </p><p>      continue to look for saviors from across their </p><p>      borders. . .!  It has never been clear to me why </p><p>      some of us would like either the South Africans or </p><p>      Americans or Britons to spend their money and time </p><p>      and risk their precious lives for the sake of our </p><p>      freedom and prosperity. . .The answer is simply that </p><p>      we are cowards!  We have decided to turn our </p><p>      criticism and anger on Mbeki. . .It is important to </p><p>      face the truth, however bitter it is.  We are our </p><p>      own enemies by being very poor administrators and </p><p>      craven cowards. . .All that Mbeki is telling us is </p><p>      to stand up and reclaim our freedom from those we </p><p>      believe to have usurped it. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
