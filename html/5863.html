<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000355 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S AND AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Tobacco Buyers Reportedly Fund New Ventures Outside </p><p>of Zimbabwe </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Harare 338 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: Dispossessed white commercial farmers </p><p>report that tobacco growers are trying to fund new ventures </p><p>for them in third countries.  Up to 170 tobacco farmers have </p><p>reportedly entered into such start-up schemes. Other farmers </p><p>report that they do not want to continue farming in </p><p>Zimbabwe, but they have not decided whether they would </p><p>pioneer in another country.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  In a recent meeting with the Commercial Farmers </p><p>Union (CFU), president Colin Cloete reported that "Big </p><p>Tobacco" (he declined to identify who this actually is, but </p><p>it appears to be tobacco buyers) is apparently financing new </p><p>start-up programs for Zimbabwean tobacco farmers in third </p><p>countries, particularly Zambia.  According to Cloete, some </p><p>tobacco buyers who need the flue-cured flavor tobacco </p><p>traditionally produced by Zim commercial farmers have opted </p><p>to fund production of the product rather than either:  a) </p><p>change their long-standing blend, or b) hold out hopes for </p><p>an adequate, if reduced, yield -- including smaller-leaved, </p><p>less well-cured, and less valuable product -- from Zimbabwe. </p><p>Tobacco buyers want the specific product and don\'t really </p><p>want to be held hostage to the questionable success of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s agricultural reform. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) According to Cloete, tobacco buyers have offered to </p><p>completely fund the start-up costs for approximately 300 </p><p>established producers on new land in third countries,  with </p><p>pay-back times ranging from five to seven years.  Up to 170 </p><p>farmers have reportedly taken up such offers.  Cloete </p><p>himself noted that he is a farmer, not a pioneer nor a </p><p>politician, and he would prefer (all things being equal) to </p><p>continue exercising his skill in Zimbabwe -- a sentiment </p><p>likely to prevail among third- and fourth-generation </p><p>farmers.  Most commercial tobacco farmers are in the </p><p>position of trying to salvage anything they can from their </p><p>lifelong investments, and some continue to farm in Zimbabwe </p><p>despite the likelihood they will lose their farms before </p><p>harvest.  Many of the tobacco farmers still operational are </p><p>fighting acquisition in court and/or struggling to fend off </p><p>land grabs, whether legal or extra-legal.   If (when) it </p><p>becomes apparent to some of the farmers who are still trying </p><p>to produce a crop that they will be wiped off the land, they </p><p>may well give in and accept a tobacco-buyer-funded start-up </p><p>elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Why Some Farmers Are Taking Up the Offers </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Other farmers have given up all hope of a return </p><p>to normalcy and business as usual in the country of their </p><p>birth.  One forty-five year old commercial tobacco farmer </p><p>reported that, even though he is at the prime of his life as </p><p>it relates to farming -- relatively young, healthy, and </p><p>possessing a wealth of specialized experience -- he does not </p><p>want to continue farming in Zimbabwe.  He pointed out that </p><p>tobacco, in particular, is a labor-intensive crop that </p><p>depends on the trust and cooperation between the farmer and </p><p>his labor force.  Although like many commercial farmers he </p><p>zealously attempted to protect his relationship with his </p><p>workers, under pressure from war vets and the influence of </p><p>Joseph Chinotimba\'s rogue "labor union," this farmer\'s labor </p><p>force "turned" against him to the point that his former </p><p>laborers participated in the occupation and looting of his </p><p>farm. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  This particular farmer\'s land was purchased in </p><p>1999 after it was turned down by the GOZ, and has never </p><p>received a Section 8, or Final Notice of Acquisition; </p><p>because of repeated harassment, the family moved into town </p><p>for its own safety.   When his wife returned to the farm to </p><p>check on horses that had been left under the care of some </p><p>trusted former workers, she was assaulted and beaten -- </p><p>along with her 17-year-old son and his friend, while her 11- </p><p>year-old daughter watched in a state of shock -- by a group </p><p>led by the politically-connected Zanu-PF beneficiary Themba </p><p>Mliswa, who is "claiming" their farm as a "new commercial </p><p>farmer."  How, this man wearily asked, could he again trust </p><p>farm laborers who looted his property and then stood by, </p><p>refusing to help, while his wife and son were being beaten </p><p>by thugs in front of them? </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (SBU)  In sum, tobacco buyers are apolitical -- they are </p><p>trying to ensure their continuing access to a specific </p><p>ingredient, and much of that access depends upon the skill </p><p>of the growers.  If Zimbabwe\'s production does not meet the </p><p>buyers\' needs, the buyers have no qualms about dropping </p><p>Zimbabwe in favor of a more controlled supply.  This new </p><p>venture may also indicate a desire by the buyers to move </p><p>away from an auction-type model -- which would increase both </p><p>freedom and income for the farmer, if the skewed economic </p><p>policies at play in Zimbabwe were eliminated -- to a </p><p>"captive-grower" model whereby the buyers would face less </p><p>uncertainty and less competition for the final product.  In </p><p>any case, such a move underscores the fact that tobacco </p><p>buyers know that expertise is crucial to produce the </p><p>valuable product that they want -- it takes more than an </p><p>interchangeable peasant farmer with a hoe.  In the end, </p><p>commercial farmers who decide that continuing to farm is </p><p>their best survival strategy may well find the security </p><p>offered by tobacco buyers to be more seductive than the </p><p>"freedom" - and concommitant risks - which a kinder and </p><p>gentler Zimbabwe previously offered. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  As we have pointed out, however (reftel), once </p><p>these farmers go, the GOZ loses a potential resource vital </p><p>for rebuilding the shattered economy -- and must further </p><p>contend with a costly compensation claim hanging over its </p><p>head.  End comment. </p><p></p></div>
