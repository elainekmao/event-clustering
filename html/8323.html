BUENOS AIRES 1704 </p><p>     B. BUENOS AIRES 1662 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL COUNSELOR MICHAEL MATERA.  REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  NESTOR KIRCHNER\'S MAY 25 INAUGURAL ADDRESS </p><p>WAS CONSISTENT WITH HIS CAMPAIGN MESSAGES ADVOCATING A </p><p>GREATER STATE ROLE IN THE ECONOMY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME </p><p>MAINTAINING FISCAL DISCIPLINE.  HE REPEATED HIS CAMPAIGN </p><p>PROMISE TO GIVE PROMINENCE OF PLACE TO ARGENTINA\'S RELATIONS </p><p>WITH OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, BEGINNING WITH MERCOSUR. </p><p> THE MODERATE TONE OF THE SPEECH WAS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO HIS </p><p>FIRST REAL ACTION AS PRESIDENT, IN WHICH HE NAMED A GENERAL </p><p>SERVING IN SANTA CRUZ PROVINCE TO HEAD THE ARMY, A MOVE </p><p>WHICH, ACCORDING TO MILITARY NORMS OF PROMOTION, WILL MEAN </p><p>THE DISMISSAL OF CLOSE TO HALF OF THE GENERALS IN THE ARMY. </p><p>IN THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY, KIRCHNER INTENDS TO PROMOTE JUNIOR </p><p>FLAG OFFICERS AS SERVICE CHIEFS AS WELL, WHICH WILL ALSO </p><p>PRODUCE MASS DISMISSALS IN THOSE SERVICES.  MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>KIRCHNER ADMINISTRATION ALSO HINTED THAT THEY WOULD NOT STAND </p><p>IN THE WAY OF CONGRESSIONAL EFFORTS TO IMPEACH THE MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT, AN ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD COULD LEAD TO </p><p>CONTINUED FIGHTING AMONG THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>REMINISCENT OF THAT WHICH TOOK PLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE </p><p>DUHALDE ADMINISTRATION.  FIDEL CASTRO\'S VISIT TO BUENOS AIRES </p><p>FOR THE INAUGURATION PROMPTED LARGE GATHERINGS AND AN </p><p>OUTPOURING OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE CUBAN LEADER.  IN A </p><p>PRESS INTERVIEW, FOREIGN MINISTER BIELSA REFUSED TO CRITICIZE </p><p>CASTRO\'S RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA, CLAIMING THAT SUCH A </p><p>CRITICISM WOULD BE "SUPERFICIAL."  FINALLY, BIELSA CLAIMED </p><p>THAT KIRCHNER WOULD VISIT WASHINGTON ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT </p><p>"WITHIN 90 DAYS" AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (1995) </p><p>JOSE OCTAVIO BORDON WAS NAMED THE NEW ARGENTINE AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>THE UNITED STATES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  NESTOR KIRCHNER\'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS ON SUNDAY, MAY </p><p>25 WAS CONSISTENT WITH MANY OF THE THEMES OUTLINED DURING HIS </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN (REF A) AND PRODUCED NO SURPRISES.  THE </p><p>MODERATE TONE OF THE ADDRESS WAS FAIRLY WELL-RECEIVED ACROSS </p><p>THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM HERE, WITH THE EXCEPTION BEING THOSE </p><p>POLITICAL FORCES LOYAL TO DEFEATED RIVAL CANDIDATES CARLOS </p><p>MENEM AND ADOLFO RODRIGUEZ SAA.  ONE OF KIRCHNER\'S MOST </p><p>FREQUENT THEMES WAS HIS CALL FOR A "SERIOUS" ADMINISTRATION, </p><p>ONE CHARACTERIZED MORE BY "DAY-TO-DAY WORK" RATHER THAN </p><p>"GRANDIOSE" ANNOUNCEMENTS OR PLANS.  A FEW POINTS FROM THE </p><p>SPEECH FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  GREATER ROLE FOR THE STATE IN THE ECONOMY.  KIRCHNER </p><p>DEFENDED HIS CALL FOR A "NATIONAL CAPITALISM" (I.E., STRONGER </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION, PROTECTING VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF </p><p>SOCIETY, INCREASED PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS </p><p>AS MEANS OF EMPLOYMENT), AS OPPOSED TO "THE MODEL OF </p><p>PERMANENT SPENDING CUTS," SAYING, "IT IS ENOUGH TO SEE HOW </p><p>THE MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES PROTECT THEIR PRODUCERS, THEIR </p><p>INDUSTRIES, AND THEIR WORKERS."  PREDICTING THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S EMPHASIS ON PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS WOULD PROVE </p><p>WRONG "NEOLIBERAL" CREEDS CRITICAL OF UNPRODUCTIVE PUBLIC </p><p>SPENDING, HE ASSERTED, "WE ARE NOT INVENTING ANYTHING NEW; </p><p>THE UNITED STATES IN THE 1930S OVERCAME THE DEEPEST ECONOMIC </p><p>CRISIS OF THE CENTURY IN THAT WAY." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  FISCAL BALANCE KEY.  DESPITE THE EMPHASIS ON </p><p>KEYNESIAN-TYPE GOVERNMENT SPENDING, HE EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>MAINTAINING BALANCE IN THE PUBLIC-SECTOR FISCAL ACCOUNTS -- </p><p>BOTH AT THE NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL LEVELS -- WOULD BE </p><p>"FUNDAMENTAL."  HE CONTINUED, "THE COUNTRY CANNOT CONTINUE </p><p>COVERING DEFICITS WITH PERMANENT INDEBTEDNESS NOR WITH </p><p>UNCONTROLLED MONEY CREATION."  ON THE REVENUE SIDE, HE </p><p>REITERATED CALLS FOR A MORE PROGRESSIVE TAX SYSTEM, LOWER TAX </p><p>RATES AS COLLECTION IMPROVED, AND STRONGER PROSECUTION OF TAX </p><p>EVASION.  HE ALSO PLEDGED TO PURSUE A NEW PROVINCIAL </p><p>REVENUE-SHARING ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD NOT ONLY IMPLY "NEW </p><p>DISTRIBUTION AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES" BUT A "NEW MODEL OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY" AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  FOREIGN POLICY:  FIRST, LATIN AMERICA.  HE </p><p>REITERATED HIS WELL-WORN THEME THAT ARGENTINA\'S TOP FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY PRIORITY WOULD BE STRENGTHENING TIES WITH LATIN </p><p>AMERICA, BEGINNING WITH MERCOSUR.  DISCARDING ANY TYPE OF </p><p>"AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT" WITH THE UNITED STATES, HE STRESSED HIS </p><p>DESIRE FOR "A SERIOUS, BROAD, AND MATURE RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION."  HE ALSO PLEDGED </p><p>THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD COOPERATE FULLY IN THE FIGHT </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>FIRST STEP:  MASS DISMISSALS IN THE MILITARY </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  IN CONTRAST TO THE MODERATE IMAGE PRESENTED IN THE </p><p>INAUGURAL SPEECH, THE KIRCHNER TEAM SURPRISED ALL OBSERVERS </p><p>HERE BY ANNOUNCING OVER THE INAUGURAL WEEKEND A MASSIVE </p><p>OVERHAUL OF THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP.  KIRCHNER\'S DESIRE TO </p><p>PUT GEN. ROBERTO BENDINI, COMMANDER OF THE XI MECHANIZED </p><p>DIVISION IN RIO GALLEGOS, SANTA CRUZ PROVINCE (WHERE KIRCHNER </p><p>SERVED AS GOVERNOR FOR MORE THAN A DECADE), IN CHARGE OF THE </p><p>ARMY APPEARS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE SHAKEUP.  DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER JOSE PAMPURO, FOR HIS PART, PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT KIRCHNER WANTED A CLOSE CONFIDANT AS ARMY CHIEF.  GIVEN </p><p>THAT BENDINI WAS 28TH ON THE ARMY LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION LIST, </p><p>HIS REPLACEMENT OF CURRENT ARMY HEAD RICARDO BRINZONI WOULD </p><p>HAVE MEANT, ACCORDING TO A STRICT INTERPRETATION OF MILITARY </p><p>PROMOTION NORMS, THE RETIREMENT OF 27 ARMY GENERALS (75 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).  PRESS REPORTS, HOWEVER, INDICATE THAT </p><p>BENDINI -- WHO WILL FORMALLY TAKE OVER THE ARMY LEADERSHIP </p><p>TODAY, MAY 28 --  WILL ASK EIGHT ARMY GENERALS FORMERLY AHEAD </p><p>OF HIM ON THE PROMOTION LIST TO REMAIN IN THE SERVICE, WHICH </p><p>WOULD MEAN THAT "ONLY" 19 ARMY GENERALS WOULD BE RETIRED.  AT </p><p>THIS POINT, IT IS UNKNOWN IF KIRCHNER WILL ACCEPT THIS </p><p>PROPOSAL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  THE OTHER SERVICES FACE SIMILAR RETIREMENTS BASED ON </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S SELECTION OF JUNIOR FLAG OFFICERS TO BECOME </p><p>SERVICE CHIEFS (E.G., 13 NAVY ADMIRALS, OR 50 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>TOTAL, AND 12 AIR FORCE GENERALS, ALSO 50 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>TOTAL, WILL APPARENTLY BE FORCED INTO RETIREMENT.)  ALL OF </p><p>THOSE RETIRING WILL BE REPLACED BY THOSE WITH PAST TIES TO </p><p>THE PROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ AND KIRCHNER.  ON MAY 30, JORGE </p><p>ALBERTO CHEVALLIER WILL TAKE OVER AS CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT </p><p>CHIEFS, A POST CURRENTLY HELD BY JUAN CARLOS MUGNOLO.  ON </p><p>JUNE 4, CARLOS ROHDE WILL TAKE CHARGE OF THE AIR FORCE, </p><p>REPLACING WALTER BARBERO.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, JORGE GODOY </p><p>WILL REPLACE JOAQUIN STELLA AS THE HEAD OF THE NAVY. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  LOCAL MILITARY EXPERT ROSENDO FRAGA SUMMARIZED THE </p><p>WIDESPREAD SENTIMENT OVER THE UNEXPECTED MOVES, ACKNOWLEDGING </p><p>THAT KIRCHNER HAD THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE </p><p>CHANGES, BUT ARGUING THAT THE PURGE DID NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE </p><p>FOR A NEW PRESIDENT TRYING TO ENSURE INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CONTINUITY.  IN GENERAL BRINZONI\'S PARTING ADDRESS TO THE </p><p>ARMY ON MAY 28, HE AFFIRMED THE ARMY\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION AND ARGENTINE LAW, BUT ADMITTED, </p><p>"THIS DISMISSAL HURTS, NOT FOR PERSONAL REASONS, BUT RATHER, </p><p>FOR THE UNEXPLAINED CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING IT."  THE MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT REASON FOR THE NEW APPOINTMENTS APPEARS TO BE </p><p>KIRCHNER\'S DESIRE TO HAVE PEOPLE HE KNOWS WELL AND TRUSTS IN </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ARMED SERVICES.  OTHER SPECULATION IS </p><p>THAT HE AND SOME OF HIS MORE LEFTIST LEANING ALLIES IN THE </p><p>NEW GOVERNMENT ARE USING THIS MASS DISMISSAL TO REMOVE ALL OF </p><p>THE MOST SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS WHO POTENTIALLY HAVE ANY </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE 1976-83 "PROCESO" PERIOD OF MILITARY </p><p>DICTATORSHIP.  (COMMENT:  LEFT-LEANING HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS HAVE </p><p>OFTEN ACCUSED MEMBERS OF THE SENIOR MILITARY LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>HAVING PLAYED ACTIVE ROLES IN "EL PROCESO" BUT WHEN PRESSED </p><p>TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE THEIR </p><p>ALLEGATIONS.  IN ADDITION, ALL MILITARY PROMOTION LISTS ARE </p><p>SUBJECT TO STRICT CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY, WHICH PRESUMABLY </p><p>WOULD HAVE EXPOSED ANY CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING.  END </p><p>COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>NEXT TARGET:  THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  THE NEW ADMINISTRATION\'S ZEAL FOR CHANGE DOES NOT </p><p>END WITH THE ARMED FORCES, BUT APPARENTLY INCLUDES THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT AS WELL.  KIRCHNER\'S NEW MINISTER OF JUSTICE, </p><p>GUSTAVO BELIZ, SAID ON HIS FIRST DAY IN OFFICE THAT THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT SHOULD NOT ESCAPE "THE NECESSARY RENOVATION OF </p><p>ALL THE POWERS OF THE STATE."  HE WAS QUICK TO ADD THAT THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION WOULD STRICTLY ADHERE TO CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>PROCEDURES IN THIS AREA.  (OF COURSE, THE CONSTITUTIONALITY </p><p>OF IMPEACHING THE MEMBERS OF THE COURT HAS NOT BEEN THE </p><p>CENTRAL QUESTION OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, BUT RATHER, THE </p><p>ADVISABILITY OF SUCH AN EFFORT.)  THE MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT FACED A DUHALDE-INSPIRED IMPEACHMENT VOTE IN THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES LAST YEAR, AN INSTITUTIONAL TIT-FOR-TAT </p><p>THAT CAUSED THE COURT TO RULE ON REPEATED OCCASIONS AGAINST </p><p>THE DUHALDE ADMINISTRATION\'S ECONOMIC POLICIES.  IN THE FACE </p><p>OF THOSE COURT DECISIONS, THE DUHALDE ADMINISTRATION </p><p>ULTIMATELY BACKED DOWN, BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE KIRCHNER TEAM </p><p>IS NOW SIGNALING ITS WILLINGNESS TO DO BATTLE WITH THE COURT </p><p>AGAIN.  IN FACT, AS NOTED IN REF B, KIRCHNER\'S NEW </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AND CONFIDANT SERGIO ACEVEDO PRESIDED OVER </p><p>THE IMPEACHMENT EFFORT AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF THE COURT </p><p>DURING THE DUHALDE ADMINISTRATION FROM HIS POST AS CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEE OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  OF </p><p>THE NINE MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT, ONLY CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>NAZARENO AND THE DUHALDE-APPOINTED JUSTICE JUAN CARLOS </p><p>MAQUEDA ATTENDED KIRCHNER\'S INAUGURATION CEREMONY, A CLEAR </p><p>SIGN OF DISAPPROVAL BY THE MEMBERS OF THE COURT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  THE FIRST TARGET REPORTEDLY WILL BE JUSTICE CARLOS </p><p>FAYT, WHO DID NOT RECUSE HIMSELF FROM PARTICIPATING IN A 2002 </p><p>COURT DECISION THAT DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE GOA\'S </p><p>"CORRALITO" BANK DEPOSIT RESTRICTIONS, DESPITE HOLDING A USD </p><p>200,000 DEPOSIT IN BANCO NACION THAT HE LATER EXCHANGED FOR </p><p>BODEN BONDS.  THERE IS WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT THE LOWER </p><p>HOUSE COULD SEEK FAYT\'S SUSPENSION AS EARLY AS THIS MONTH </p><p>WHILE PURSUING THE IMPEACHMENT CASE AGAINST HIM, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THERE IS SOME DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE AUTHORITY TO TEMPORARY </p><p>SUSPEND A JUDGE FACING IMPEACHMENT RESTS WITH THE SENATE OR </p><p>THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  IF THOSE DEPUTIES LOYAL TO THE </p><p>KIRCHNER ADMINISTRATION SUCCEED IN IMPEACHING FAYT, THEY </p><p>ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD SEEK TO DO THE SAME WITH THE MEMBERS </p><p>OF MENEM\'S SO-CALLED "AUTOMATIC MAJORITY":  JULIO NAZARENO, </p><p>ANTONIO BOGGIANO, GUSTAVO LOPEZ, ADOLFO VAZQUEZ, AND EDUARDO </p><p>MOLINE O\'CONNOR. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>CASTRO GRABS HEADLINES </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  THE VISIT OF FIDEL CASTRO TO ARGENTINA FOR THE MAY </p><p>25 INAUGURATION CAPTURED WIDESPREAD MEDIA AND PUBLIC </p><p>ATTENTION, WITH THE OVERWHELMING PUBLIC SENTIMENT CLEARLY </p><p>FAVORABLY DISPOSED TO THE CUBAN LEADER.  CASTRO\'S VISIT </p><p>COMPLETELY OVERSHADOWED THOSE OF BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT LULA AND </p><p>VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CHAVEZ.  THE TRIP WAS CASTRO\'S THIRD </p><p>VISIT TO ARGENTINA, FOLLOWING EARLIER TRIPS IN 1959 (SHORTLY </p><p>AFTER THE REVOLUTION) AND 1995 (DURING THE MENEM </p><p>ADMINISTRATION TO ATTEND THE IBERO-AMERICAN SUMMIT IN </p><p>BARILOCHE).  NEWSPAPERS CARRIED PHOTOS OF A BEAMING KIRCHNER </p><p>LAUGHING AND CONVERSING WITH CASTRO AND THE TWO HAD THE </p><p>LONGEST OF THE FORMER\'S MEETINGS WITH VISITING HEADS OF </p><p>STATE.  ON MONDAY MAY 26, CASTRO DELIVERED A TWO-HOUR-PLUS </p><p>SPEECH ON THE OUTSIDE STEPS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES </p><p>LAW FACULTY BEFORE 5,000 ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS.  AT ANOTHER </p><p>EVENT THE SAME DAY, BUENOS AIRES CITY MAYOR ANIBAL IBARRA </p><p>PINNED A MEDAL ON CASTRO\'S CHEST AND DESCRIBED HIM AS "ONE OF </p><p>THE MOST RESPECTED MEN IN THE WORLD."  THE FOLLOWING DAY, A </p><p>SPANISH DAILY PUBLISHED AN INTERVIEW WITH FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>RAFAEL BIELSA, WHO SAID:  "I DO NOT DARE TO SAY OPENLY THAT </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BEING VIOLATED IN CUBA.  I DO NOT HAVE THE </p><p>MORAL AUTHORITY, NOR A POST WHICH WOULD ALLOW ME TO SAY </p><p>SOMETHING SO SUPERFICIAL." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>GOA SAYS KIRCHNER-BUSH TO MEET IN 90 DAYS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  NEWSPAPER HEADLINES ON MAY 27 TRUMPETED GOVERNMENT </p><p>DECLARATIONS THAT KIRCHNER WOULD VISIT WASHINGTON ON AN </p><p>OFFICIAL VISIT WITHIN 90 DAYS, FOLLOWING PUBLIC CONFIRMATION </p><p>BY THE FOREIGN MINISTER THAT PRESIDENT BUSH, IN HIS MAY 23 </p><p>PHONE CONVERSATION WITH KIRCHNER, HAD INVITED THE NEW </p><p>PRESIDENT TO VISIT WASHINGTON.  IN A CONFUSED STATEMENT ON </p><p>MAY 26, FOREIGN MINISTER BIELSA, EXPLAINED THAT KIRCHNER WAS </p><p>TRAVELING TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE "ARGENTINA HAD TO DISCUSS </p><p>ISSUES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT, SUCH AS IN THE DISPUTE </p><p>RESOLUTION ORGANIZATION THAT THE WORLD BANK HAS, AND IN THE </p><p>MULTILATERAL CREDIT ORGANIZATIONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MONETARY FUND.  THERE, THE VOICE OF THE UNITED STATES IS VERY </p><p>IMPORTANT."  THESE GOA DECLARATIONS CAME ABOUT DESPITE THE </p><p>FACT THAT A SPECIFIC TIMETABLE FOR A KIRCHNER VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON WAS NOT BROACHED IN SECRETARY MARTINEZ\'S OFFICIAL </p><p>MEETINGS WITH KIRCHNER. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  IN OTHER NEWS OF IMMEDIATE BILATERAL INTEREST, JOS </p><p>OCTAVIO BORDN WAS TAPPED BY THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION AS </p><p>ARGENTINA\'S NEW AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES.  THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF THE WELL-RESPECTED BORDN -- THE 1995 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND LATER, FREPASO LEADER -- IS A </p><p>POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, DESPITE THE FACT THAT BORDN DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE A PARTICULARLY STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH KIRCHNER.  OTHER </p><p>SIGNIFICANT APPOINTMENTS INCLUDE JUAN PABLO LOHLE AS THE NEW </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO BRASILIA AND JORGE VAZQUEZ AS THE NEW </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE OAS AND JORGE TAIANA AS THE NEW MFA UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS (REPLACING FERNANDO </p><p>PETRELLA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DRUCKER </p><p></p></div>
