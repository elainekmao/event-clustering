<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001776 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE, EUR/RPM AND EUR/ERA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, IT, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: ESDP MINI SUMMIT - GOI VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 103884 B) ROME 1678 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINISTER COUNSELOR THOMAS M. COUNTRYMAN.  REASON:1.5 </p><p>(B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) WE DELIVERED POINTS REF A TO GIOVANNI BRAUZZI, HEAD </p><p>OF THE MFA\'S NATO AFFAIRS OFFICE, AND SANDRO DE BERNADIN, </p><p>ESDP DIRECTOR IN THE MFA EUROPEAN INTEGRATION BUREAU.  AS </p><p>INDICATED REF B, THE OFFICIAL GOI VIEW, AS VOICED BY FM </p><p>FRATTINI AT THE APRIL 14 GAC LUNCH, IS STRONGLY CRITICAL OF </p><p>THE INITIATIVE, AND CONSISTENT WITH THE USG VIEW EXPRESSED </p><p>REF A THAT IT RUNS THE RISK OF DUPLICATING EXISTING NATO </p><p>CAPABILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  BRAUZZI SAID HE SHARED OUR PERSPECTIVE.  ITALY IS </p><p>INTERESTED IN REINFORCING ESDP BUT ONLY IN A WAY THAT </p><p>COMPLEMENTS NATO.  HE AGREED THAT EU COUNTRIES SHOULD BE </p><p>LOOKING TO ADD TO, AND NOT DUPLICATE, EXISTING CAPABILITIES. </p><p>BRAUZZI QUESTIONED WHY WE WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT REFERENCES </p><p>TO NATO ARTICLE FIVE-LIKE COMMITMENTS OF "GENERAL SOLIDARITY" </p><p>OR "MUTUAL ASSISTANCE WHEN LANGUAGE TO THIS EFFECT WAS </p><p>CONTAINED IN THE WEU BRUSSELS PACT.  POLOFF EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>SUCH A REFERENCE IN COMBINATION WITH A MOVE TO SET UP A </p><p>SEPARATE HEADQUARTERS STRUCTURE AND DUPLICATE CAPABILITIES </p><p>WOULD BE TROUBLESOME.  BRAUZZI TOOK THE POINT.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>WHILE IT WAS EASY FOR HIM, AS DIRECTOR OF THE NATO OFFICE, TO </p><p>AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH OUR APPROACH TO THE MINI-SUMMIT, A </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH MFA COLLEAGUES DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ESDP </p><p>MIGHT RESULT IN A SLIGHTLY MORE NUANCED ANSWER. </p><p></p><p>3.  (C)  DE BERNADIN SAID THAT WHILE HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH </p><p>THE DRAFT COMMUNIQUE IN ITS CURRENT FORM, HE REASSURED POLOFF </p><p>THAT IT WOULD NOT CONTAIN LANGUAGE CONTRADICTING OR </p><p>UNDERCUTTING BERLIN-PLUS.  FURTHER, ANY ARRANGEMENTS PROPOSED </p><p>DURING THE SUMMIT WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED, UNANIMOUSLY, AT </p><p>15.  FM FRATTINI\'S VIEWS ON NON-DUPLICATION ARE WELL KNOWN, </p><p>AND SUCH VIEWS ARE SHARED BY OTHER EU MINISTERS.  WHILE NOT </p><p>ADDRESSING THE HEADQUARTERS ISSUE DIRECTLY, HE SAID THAT IT </p><p>WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THE SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE WOULD BE </p><p>ANYTHING MORE THAN PROPOSALS TO ENHANCE EUROPEAN MILITARY </p><p>CAPABILITIES. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>2003ROME01776 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
