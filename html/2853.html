<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001396 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR E:ANNE PENCE AND AF/W DON BOOTH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PROCTOR AND GAMBLE DETERGENT COULD BE </p><p>\'GRANDFATHERED\' UNDER OLD TARIFF RATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) LAGOS 908 </p><p>     B. B) ABUJA 1163 </p><p>     C. C) LAGOS 725 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. In a April 12 meeting with the President\'s Principal </p><p>Secretary Stephen Oronsaye and the President\'s Special </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Assistant for Budget Oby Ezekwisili, Ambassador Jeter raised </p><p>Proctor and Gamble\'s concerns over the recent hike in tariffs </p><p>on detergent from 40 percent to 100 percent.  The Ambassador </p><p>said that the U.S. company would not be able to sustain its </p><p>domestic manufacturing capability in Nigeria without lower </p><p>tariffs on its detergent, Ariel.  P&G\'s proposed $30 million </p><p>investment in a greenfield factory in Ibadan would be halted </p><p>if the tariff increase were not rescinded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Oronsaye and Ezekwisili unambiguously responded that, </p><p>under no circumstances, would the tariff hike be reversed; </p><p>because the increase was designed specifically to protect </p><p>domestic manufacturers of detergent.  Proctor and Gamble is </p><p>not manufacturing detergent in Nigeria, but importing it in </p><p>bulk for local packaging, Oronsaye noted.  At the </p><p>Ambassador\'s insistence, Oronsaye conceded that perhaps P&G </p><p>could be \'grandfathered\' to enable them to import Ariel </p><p>detergent under the old 40 percent rate for a specified time </p><p>and at an agreed upon volume.  Oronsaye thought this might be </p><p>possible with a commitment from P&G to begin detergent </p><p>manufacturing in Nigeria no later than 2.5 years following </p><p>the grant of the grandfathered concession by the GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Comment. The GON position on P&G\'s request for lower </p><p>tariffs is unequivocal. Oronsaye and Ezekwisili are two of </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s closest advisors on economic and </p><p>budgetary issues and both influence and reflect his thinking. </p><p> Post has recommended to Proctor and Gamble that it consider </p><p>making a formal request to the GON to \'grandfather\' Ariel </p><p>detergent.  Oronsaye\'s proposal would obviously be subject to </p><p>negotiation.  Two and a half years at the status quo ante </p><p>rate might allow P&G to begin the manufacture of Ariel in </p><p>Nigeria.  The company could then benefit from the high tariff </p><p>on detergent.  End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
