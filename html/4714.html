<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003311 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT -- SHAUN LONERGAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, SNAR, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  FATF UPDATE -- NEW HOPE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 3185 </p><p>     B. 3138 </p><p>     C. AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU)  RNLEO December 12 contacted Senator Abdullahi </p><p>Abubakar, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Drugs and </p><p>Financial Crimes, for an update on the legislation being </p><p>considered by the National Assembly in response to FATF </p><p>concerns.  Abubakar reported that he had chaired a </p><p>"harmonization" committee meeting consisting of two other key </p><p>Senators and three members of the House of Representatives on </p><p>the night of December 10.  The harmonization committee met </p><p>immediately following a House meeting on the draft anti-money </p><p>laundering legislation.  According to Abubakar, the </p><p>harmonization committee members had been sensitized to the </p><p>concerns of the FATF with regards to the changes made by the </p><p>Senate to the draft Amendment to the Money Laundering Act of </p><p>1995.  The earlier Senate changes had raised the reporting </p><p>thresholds for customer identification and cash transactions </p><p>to levels deemed unacceptable by the FATF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU)  Abubakar claims that the harmonization committee </p><p>approved the original language and reporting thresholds (USD </p><p>5,000 or equivalent for customer identification and naira one </p><p>million/five million for reporting of individual/corporate </p><p>cash transactions) proposed by President Obasanjo in the </p><p>draft bills submitted in October.   According to Abubakar, </p><p>the full Senate is being recalled from recess for an </p><p>emergency session on Saturday, December 14 to vote on the </p><p>revised Senate legislation.  He expects the Senate to approve </p><p>the revised legislation and pass it to the President for </p><p>signature later in the day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Announcements in local papers December 13 confirm </p><p>Abubakar\'s statement of an extraordinary Senate session on </p><p>December 14.  One such announcement in daily newspaper "This </p><p>Day" reads:  "The Senate will reconvene tomorrow for a </p><p>special session to discuss various issues of national </p><p>importance.  According to a statement signed by the Clerk of </p><p>the Senate yesterday, Senators are expected to assemble for </p><p>the special session at 10 a.m. The Senate which began its end </p><p>of year recess is expected to reconvene end of January." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) Comment:  We will monitor the progress of the Senate </p><p>special session and seek to obtain copies of the final </p><p>legislation as soon as it is produced.  These will be faxed </p><p>immediately to INL, AF and Treasury for analysis.  The </p><p>Executive and Legislative branches are working together </p><p>closely (a rarity) to meet Nigeria\'s international </p><p>obligations.  Wednesday\'s and tomorrow\'s emergency, </p><p>recess-breaking sessions of the House and Senate are a </p><p>remarkable sign of the seriousness with which the Government </p><p>is taking the threat of  FATF sanctions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU)  With a yard from the goal line, we would hope that </p><p>U.S. Treasury would refrain from making a public announcement </p><p>on potential Patriot Act Section 311 special measures </p><p>(accompanying the designation of Nigeria as a jurisdiction of </p><p>"primary money laundering concern") until it has had time to </p><p>analyze the legislation that may be enacted over the weekend </p><p>or early next week. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
