<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000412 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/PD, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: SHOTGUN WEDDING:  UBCV AND VBS TOGETHER AT LAST? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A)  2002 HCMC 914   B)  HANOI 807  C)  HANOI 842 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  In a meeting with the Consul General on May </p><p>9, Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) Patriarch Thich Huyen </p><p>Quang spoke hopefully of a new openness on the part of the GVN </p><p>toward efforts to unite the UBCV with the officially recognized </p><p>Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS).  The Patriarch, who was allowed to </p><p>travel to HCMC after more than 20 years of "pagoda detention" in </p><p>rural Quang Ngai Province, was also realistic about the roadblocks </p><p>ahead.  Repeatedly denying any interest in "political activities," </p><p>he said his overwhelming goal now was to unify the two Buddhist </p><p>churches.  Crediting the USG and other members of the </p><p>international community for past and present efforts on behalf of </p><p>his cause, he stressed the UBCV was not quite ready to make it on </p><p>its own.  Still, Thich Huyen Quang claimed the majority of </p><p>Vietnamese Buddhists were really still "his", even if the UBCV </p><p>organization itself had grown weak.  He concluded by saying he was </p><p>still "measuring the situation," but realized "things outside are </p><p>very complicated."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Consul General and ConGenoffs met with Thich Huyen </p><p>Quang at An Quang Pagoda, the former principal pagoda of the UBCV </p><p>and current home of the HCMC Buddhist Sangha, the southern branch </p><p>of the VBS.  The meeting was arranged by UBCV General Secretary </p><p>Thich Tue Sy, who also attended.  (Note:  Unlike previous calls on </p><p>members of the official VBS hierarchy at An Quang, this visit did </p><p>not require a diplomatic note or notification to the local MFA </p><p>branch.  While it is clear GVN officials would have had to approve </p><p>today\'s meeting, it is remarkable that we were allowed to work the </p><p>appointment entirely through the offices of the "outlawed" UBCV.) </p><p>In addition to the two UBCV leaders, three high-ranking VBS monks, </p><p>with whom ConGenoffs have met in the past, also attended. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Thich Huyen Quang appeared in fairly good health, but </p><p>harder of hearing and less focused than during an October 2002 </p><p>meeting at his pagoda in Quang Ngai Province (ref A).  He said he </p><p>was satisfied with the medical attention he had received in Hanoi </p><p>and was confident that his needs would be met in the future (ref </p><p>B).  The atmosphere during the meeting was much more low-key than </p><p>during the visit to Quang Ngai.  Despite the presence of high- </p><p>ranking VBS monks in the room, he spoke openly and comfortably. </p><p>For their part, the VBS monks refrained from the frequent </p><p>interruptions and prompting that had marked the behavior of the </p><p>Quang Ngai authorities. (Thich Huyen Quang twice referred to the </p><p>heavy-handed tactics of his handlers during the October meeting in </p><p>Quang Ngai, apologizing for their rudeness.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Recapping his April meeting with Prime Minister Phan </p><p>Van Khai in Hanoi (ref C), Thich Huyen Quang was clearly pleased </p><p>that the PM had publicly acknowledged the contributions of the </p><p>UBCV "to the resistance".  He also appreciated the PM\'s sending </p><p>someone to check on his health in Quang Ngai.  He had pressed PM </p><p>Khai for the release of detained UBCV leaders, including himself </p><p>and Thich Quang Do.  He had also asked for written documentation </p><p>of the reasons for the continued detentions, and an official </p><p>statement on the legal status of the UBCV.  While PM Khai did not </p><p>answer those questions, he promised to act with "Buddhist mercy </p><p>and compassion" in his future dealings with the UBCV.  In return, </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang promised to respond with "Buddhist tolerance." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Thich Huyen Quang had spent 20 days in his hometown of </p><p>Quy Nhon, reconnecting with the UBCV faithful before traveling to </p><p>HCMC.  UBCV followers noted a real improvement in the way they had </p><p>been treated by local authorities since his meeting with PM Khai. </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang had then asked to visit HCMC in order to meet </p><p>with UBCV leaders and attempt to reestablish some viable form of </p><p>organization.  While he did not go into detail on the logistics of </p><p>his trip, he did not seem to have encountered any government </p><p>resistance to his plan.  Thich Huyen Quang had hoped to stay in a </p><p>UBCV pagoda upon his arrival, but seemed genuinely pleased with </p><p>GVN arrangements to provide him space at his former pagoda, which </p><p>had been UBCV headquarters before 1975.  Since arriving in HCMC, </p><p>he had met with many followers and was "happy to see that UBCV </p><p>believers are still here." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The Patriarch requested, and was able to meet, with </p><p>HCMC People\'s Committee Chairman Le Thanh Hai on May 8.  During </p><p>their discussions, Chairman Hai tacitly opened the way for </p><p>discussions on "legalizing" the UBCV through integration with the </p><p>VBS.  When the Patriarch asked Chairman Hai if the two churches </p><p>could be merged, Hai responded that was an internal matter to be </p><p>resolved by the two churches -- but he believed one day there </p><p>would be a single, unified church.  Thich Tri Quang, head of the </p><p>HCMC Buddhist Sangha, also attended that meeting and supported the </p><p>concept of unification.  Based on Chairman Hai and Thich Tri </p><p>Quang\'s responses, the Patriarch said he believed the GVN really </p><p>wanted to heal the schism within the Buddhist community.  Showing </p><p>off HCMC as the nation\'s economic engine, the People\'s Committee </p><p>took Thich Huyen Quang to the new Saigon South urban development </p><p>area - where upscale villas cost USD 800,000. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  After some prodding, Thich Huyen Quang briefly </p><p>summarized his May 5 meeting with number two-ranking UBCV leader </p><p>Thich Quang Do, who has been under administrative detention in </p><p>HCMC since June 2001.  During the meeting, Thich Quang Do had </p><p>emphasized the need to get the UBCV\'s own house in order before </p><p>opening negotiations with the VBS.  Long years of operating as an </p><p>underground church had taken their toll and left the UBCV </p><p>splintered and disorganized.  Thich Huyen Quang deflected several </p><p>attempts by ConGenoffs to elicit predictions on whether Thich </p><p>Quang Do\'s administrative detention would be lifted on schedule </p><p>this June.  He did note that the meeting had ended with Thich </p><p>Quang Do saying he looked forward to visiting Thich Huyen Quang </p><p>and continuing the discussion in Quy Nhon.  (Thich Huyen Quang </p><p>told ConGenoffs he would be returning to Quy Nhon rather than </p><p>Quang Ngai after leaving HCMC.  He plans to use An Quang Pagoda as </p><p>his base of operations for meetings in HCMC from time to time.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Assessing the likelihood of merging the UBCV with the </p><p>VBS, the Patriarch noted, "agreeing is easy, but the process is </p><p>difficult."  He placed great stock in UBCV "(human) assets and </p><p>property" as leverage, claiming that many VBS monks and nuns are </p><p>actually UBCV followers.  While the UBCV still holds a number of </p><p>properties that had escaped (or been spared) confiscation, he </p><p>hoped the GVN would consider returning other former assets.  He </p><p>said he expected to meet with the VBS to discuss a merger in the </p><p>near future.  He hopes the two churches will be allowed to sit </p><p>down and discuss - free of GVN interference - their merger, and </p><p>that local authorities would allow the UBCV to reconstruct its </p><p>organizational framework.  Thich Huyen Quang described a future </p><p>unified church which would steer clear of politics, focusing its </p><p>efforts on spiritual matters and charitable works.  While he </p><p>acknowledged that some Buddhists had participated in political </p><p>activities in the past, he stressed the need to concentrate on </p><p>religious affairs during this time of peace. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  A recurring theme in the 75 minute-long meeting was </p><p>appreciation for the efforts of the world community and </p><p>international media in supporting the UBCV cause.  The Patriarch </p><p>expressed thanks to the many countries that had allowed UBCV </p><p>Buddhists to maintain the 2000-year-old tradition of Vietnamese </p><p>Buddhism overseas.  Asked what the USG and others could do to </p><p>support the peaceful integration of the two Buddhist churches, he </p><p>noted the importance of continuing international support for and </p><p>media attention to efforts to train new monks and nuns, organize </p><p>UBCV activities at the local level, communicate with believers </p><p>overseas, and build a UBCV public information apparatus.  He also </p><p>cited pressing needs for renovation of many UBCV properties. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Another recurring feature was Thich Tue Sy\'s strident </p><p>voice interrupting the Patriarch to drive home his own call for </p><p>continued international support for the absolute separation of </p><p>church and state in Vietnam.  Citing the Universal Declaration on </p><p>Human Rights, he insisted no true religion could ever submit to a </p><p>secular authority ("there are no worldly ends for us").  While </p><p>Thich Tue Sy said he would work within the framework of the </p><p>Vietnamese Constitution, his determination to pursue "pure </p><p>spiritualism" outside the supervision of the Fatherland Front and </p><p>Communist Party seemed at odds with Thich Huyen Quang\'s resigned </p><p>pragmatism.  The difference in viewpoint was clear in their </p><p>responses to a question on whether the GVN would allow interviews </p><p>with foreign journalists.  While the English-speaking Thich Tue Sy </p><p>immediately responded "no problem," the Patriarch\'s more reserved </p><p>answer after hearing the Vietnamese translation was, "depends on </p><p>the Government." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Comment:  ConGenoffs have previously met with VBS and </p><p>UBCV monks separately.  But together in the same room, we found </p><p>less tension between the formal VBS-UBCV adversaries than between </p><p>the two UBCV leaders themselves.  The VBS monks sat silently by </p><p>while the elderly, revered Patriarch of its UBCV rival listened </p><p>patiently to the strident demands of a monk whom he himself has </p><p>anointed "executive director" of the UBCV once it "gets its house </p><p>in order." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Comment (cont.):  It is too early to tell whether the </p><p>GVN, VBS, and UBCV are really ready to mend fences.  The actions </p><p>of "hard-line" elements who might push the envelope right off the </p><p>table should also be taken into account.  While Thich Huyen </p><p>Quang\'s recent travels, meetings, and pronouncements are something </p><p>we could not have imagined last October, no one at today\'s meeting </p><p>made any concrete predictions for the future.  Thich Huyen Quang </p><p>closed the discussion by saying he was still "measuring the </p><p>situation," and acknowledged "things outside are very </p><p>complicated."  The next signal to watch for may be whether the GVN </p><p>renews Thich Quang Do\'s administrative detention when it expires </p><p>next month. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
