<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000481 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES/ENV, WHA/CAN (RUNNING) </p><p> </p><p>EPA FOR OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (CHRISTICH) </p><p> </p><p>INTERIOR FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE (GLOMAN) </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4320/MAC/WH/ON/OIA/BENDER </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, CA </p><p>SUBJECT:  Invasive Species: IJC speaks to Parliamentary </p><p>Committee </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. The American Co-Chair of the International Joint </p><p>Commission (IJC) sought the support of members of the House </p><p>of Commons Fisheries and Oceans committee for a joint US-GoC </p><p>reference to the IJC on the Great Lakes invasive species </p><p>problem. First impressions are that the committee is pre- </p><p>occupied with other matters and will not be the Commons </p><p>committee to push the GoC toward endorsing a joint </p><p>reference.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Dennis Schornack, Chair of the U.S. Section of the IJC </p><p>briefed members of the House of Commons Standing Committee </p><p>on Fisheries and Oceans on February 11th concerning Alien </p><p>Invasive Species.  Schornack\'s comments are provided in full </p><p>(as well as statements by Canadian Section Chair Herb Gray </p><p>and Canadian Commissioner Robert Gourd) at the following IJC </p><p>web address: </p><p> </p><p>http://www.ijc.org/ijcweb-e.html </p><p> </p><p>3. The bottom-line message from Schornack to the members of </p><p>the committee was: invasive species are the number one </p><p>threat to the economic and biological integrity of the Great </p><p>Lakes and the IJC continues to call for a reference from the </p><p>two governments to coordinate and harmonize bi-national </p><p>efforts to stop this threat. (Such a reference was first </p><p>recommended in September 2002 in the IJC\'s 11th Biennial </p><p>Report on Great Lakes Water Quality.) </p><p> </p><p>4 With respect to the most up-to-date assessment of what </p><p>action needs to be taken to confront this challenge, Mr. </p><p>Schornack noted the recent report published by the </p><p>International Association for Great Lakes Research (IAGLR). </p><p>It\'s called "Research and Management Priorities for Aquatic </p><p>Invasive Species in the Great Lakes" and is available at: </p><p>http://www.iaglr.org/scipolicy/ais/ </p><p> </p><p>5. This was only the second set of hearings by this </p><p>committee on the issue. The first hearing, on February 6th, </p><p>featured Chris Goddard, Executive Secretary of the Great </p><p>Lakes Fisheries Commission. At the end of February, the </p><p>Committee expects to hear from representatives of the </p><p>Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Transport </p><p>Canada and Environment Canada.  According to the Clerk of </p><p>the committee, given other priorities, the earliest date for </p><p>the Committee to issue a report on invasive species will be </p><p>the end of April. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Impact of IJC presentation </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. In Emboff\'s opinion, there was no evidence that the IJC\'s </p><p>presentation will elicit a strong effort from this committee </p><p>or lead to GoC support for a reference to the IJC. There are </p><p>those on the committee who feel this is a significant issue </p><p>demanding immediate government focus, but it is not clear </p><p>this particular committee will take the lead in pressing the </p><p>GoC for action on invasive species. </p><p> </p><p>7. The government has had an "action plan" on invasive </p><p>species since 1995 (put in place in response to the </p><p>Convention on Biological Diversity) that names the </p><p>Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Environment Canada and </p><p>Transport Canada as the responsible agencies.  The problem, </p><p>however, according to the Commissioner of Environment and </p><p>Sustainable Development (part of the GoC Auditor General\'s </p><p>organization), is that none of these departments is willing </p><p>to take a leading role to ensure that the action plan </p><p>results in concrete actions.  Likewise, many members of the </p><p>Fisheries and Oceans Committee believe that another </p><p>committee, perhaps Environment, should take the lead on this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>8. There was one suggestion, however, which we expect to </p><p>appear in the Committee\'s final report.  The Canadian Chair, </p><p>Herb Gray, made the eminently sensible recommendation that </p><p>one cabinet Minister should be named as the lead Minister on </p><p>Invasive Species and have the power of the Prime Minister </p><p>behind him or her to move departments forward in a </p><p>coordinated fashion.  This might energize GoC action on </p><p>Invasive species - and reduce the impetus for a reference to </p><p>the IJC. </p><p> </p><p>9. Comment: Although the IJC presentation to the Committee </p><p>may not be critical in the GoC\'s decision process, it does </p><p>fit with the generally greater emphasis this issue is </p><p>getting in Ottawa.  We continue to receive "feelers" from </p><p>DFAIT about their interest in consulting with Washington on </p><p>IJC\'s proposal for a joint reference, as well as addressing </p><p>the broader issue of dealing with alien invasive species in </p><p>the "North American" context.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
