<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001234 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, EAIR, ETTC, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DCM\'S MEETING WITH ENERGY MINISTER BATAYNEH </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Following are info items from the DCM\'s February 24 </p><p>meeting with Energy Minister Mohammed Batayneh: </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Gasoil shortage:  Due to unseasonably cold weather, </p><p>local consumption of gasoil and fuel oil has risen higher </p><p>than expected.  Normally, Jordan stockpiles gasoil and fuel </p><p>oil reserves in the summer for winter use, but the heavy </p><p>demand this winter has led to a shortfall in stocks. </p><p>Batayneh said he was issuing a tender to procure an </p><p>additional 20,000 tons of gasoil to meet the additional needs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Jet Fuel Price Hike:  Batayneh confirmed local </p><p>press reports that the GOJ had increased jet fuel prices.  He </p><p>noted, though, that the hike only applied to foreign </p><p>commercial carriers; that the new price was still below the </p><p>price in 2000; and that the new price was still below the </p><p>average price of jet fuel in the region. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Request for Oil/Trade Protocol Increase:  Batayneh </p><p>denied recent local press reports that Jordan had requested a </p><p>10% increase in quantities shipped under the Jordan-Iraq oil </p><p>protocol for 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Independent Power Project:  Despite a pullout in </p><p>late 2002 by Tractebel from the Independent Power Project in </p><p>Al Samra, Batayneh said the project was now back on track. </p><p>He said a new RFP had been sent to prospective investor </p><p>groups headed by Saudi AG, ABB, CCC, and a U.S. firm, </p><p>Northwest.  Batayneh said he expected the tender to be </p><p>awarded by the end of April 2003. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Iraq-Zarqa Oil Pipeline:  Batayneh said financial </p><p>details were now being submitted by firms interested in </p><p>bidding on the oil pipeline.  He said he hoped to have the </p><p>tender awarded in March (note: this project has been </p><p>re-tendered at least three times after bidders failed to </p><p>commit to financing citing political risk factors.  End </p><p>note.)  Batayneh confirmed that the terms of the RFP include </p><p>building of infrastructure on the Iraqi side of the border </p><p>(storage tanks and a feeder facility for tanker trucks) and </p><p>turning over the facilities to the Iraqi government prior to </p><p>the beginning of commercial operations.  He admitted that </p><p>such a provision might complicate the bidding process in the </p><p>current environment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  Press Management:  Batayneh noted that managing </p><p>press interest in the oil sector in the run-up to possible </p><p>military activity in Iraq was becoming increasingly </p><p>challenging.  He said that, despite the fact that Jordan is </p><p>comfortable with its levels of reserves, he could not control </p><p>rumors on the street that gasoline and diesel rationing was </p><p>imminent - rumors he said were patently false.  He said it </p><p>would be critical in the coming weeks to keep oil issues out </p><p>of the press, for fear that Iraq might seize on mounting </p><p>public concern and cut off access to oil earlier than a </p><p>conflict scenario would allow for.  On this front, he said he </p><p>had the full backing of the cabinet to make himself the only </p><p>point of contact for the press on oil issues. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
