There have </p><p>been 13 deaths in Canada - all clustered in Toronto, </p><p>Ontario.  To date, transmission has been limited to </p><p>specific transmission settings such as households, </p><p>hospitals and specific community settings.  The </p><p>following figures reflect the situation as of 13:00 </p><p>Eastern Daylight Saving Time, April 15, unless </p><p>otherwise noted: </p><p>2. Ontario is reporting 105 probable and 139 suspect </p><p>cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have </p><p>traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the </p><p>household or in a health-care setting. (See Toronto </p><p>reporting for details.) </p><p>3. British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 37 </p><p>suspect cases as of 19:00 Eastern Daylight Saving Time, </p><p>April 15.
