IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS (ZCTU) BELIEVES THAT </p><p>THE LABOR FEDERATION WILL MAINTAIN ITS CLOSE TIES TO THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PARTY </p><p>AFTER ITS FEBRUARY CONGRESS.  HE IS ALSO OF THE OPINION </p><p>THAT THE CONGRESS WILL PUBLICLY AFFIRM THAT THE </p><p>FEDERATION HAS NO FORMAL LINKAGE TO ANY POLITICAL PARTY, </p><p>THAT ZCTU EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBERS SHOULD NOT BE SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS IN POLITICAL PARTIES, AND THAT INDIVIDUAL </p><p>MEMBERS ARE FREE TO SUPPORT THE POLITICAL PARTY OF THEIR </p><p>CHOICE.  HOWEVER, HE PREDICTS THAT PRO-MDC PERSONNEL </p><p>WILL BE ELECTED TO FEDERATION LEADERSHIP, AND TRADE </p><p>UNIONISTS AND THE URBAN ELECTORATE WILL SUPPORT THE MDC </p><p>CANDIDATE IN THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ON JANUARY 25, LABOFF MET WITH ONE OF TWO </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARIES-GENERAL OF THE ZCTU, NICHOLAS </p><p>MUDZENGERERE.  MUDZENGERERE IS ALSO THE SECRETARY- </p><p>GENERAL OF THE ZIMBABWE CATERING AND HOTEL WORKERS </p><p>UNION, AND A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF </p><p>THE MDC.  MUDZENGERERE HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN UNION </p><p>ORGANIZATION HIS ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIFE.  HE HAS BEEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00612  01 OF 02  311445Z </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE CATERING AND HOTEL WORKERS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>UNION SINCE 1995 AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE </p><p>ZCTU SINCE 1985. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MUDZENGERERE TOLD LABOFF THAT THE ZCTU CONGRESS </p><p>WOULD AFFIRM THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE LABOR FEDERATION </p><p>FROM ANY ONE POLITICAL PARTY, BUT ALSO INSISTED THAT THE </p><p>CONGRESS WOULD ELECT PRO-MDC UNION LEADERS TO THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE AND GENERAL COUNCIL.  HE STATED THAT THE </p><p>CONGRESS WILL AFFIRM THAT MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>COUNCIL CANNOT ALSO BE SENIOR OFFICIALS OF POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES.  THIS IS BECAUSE THE ZCTU CONSTITUTION STATES </p><p>WHILE "EVERY MEMBER AND OFFICER OF A UNION, AND THE </p><p>ZCTU, IS FREE TO JOIN A POLITICAL PARTY OF THEIR CHOICE, </p><p>THAT RELATIONSHIP SHOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH HIS DUTIES </p><p>TO THE UNION AND CONGRESS."  THIS CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>PROVISION IS NOT NEW, AND COMES FROM THE COMMON SENSE </p><p>BELIEF THAT "ONE HEAD CANNOT WEAR TWO HATS," REMARKED </p><p>MUDZENGERERE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MUDZENGERERE CLARIFIED THAT THE ZCTU CONGRESS </p><p>WILL INTERPRET THE "NO INTERFERENCE WITH DUTIES" CLAUSE </p><p>AS ONLY EXCLUDING PARTY OFFICIALS AND LEADERS WHO HAVE </p><p>FULL-TIME AND NATIONAL PARTY RESPONSIBILITIES.  LABOFF </p><p>ASKED IF THIS WOULD EXCLUDE HIM FROM REELECTION TO THE </p><p>ZCTU EXECUTIVE COUNCIL BECAUSE HE IS A MEMBER OF THE MDC </p><p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.  MUDZENGERERE ANSWERED THAT </p><p>THIS WAS THE TYPE OF PARTY JOB THAT WAS NOT FULL TIME, </p><p>AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT PRESENT A CONFLICT.  HE </p><p>INDICATED THAT MEMBERS OF BOTH HIS UNION AND OTHERS HAVE </p><p>ALREADY APPROACHED HIM PROPOSING THAT HE RUN FOR THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00612  01 OF 02  311445Z </p><p>POSITION OF SECRETARY-GENERAL.  MUDZENGERERE IS </p><p>SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THIS OPTION, HE INFORMED US. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) LABOFF ASKED MUDZENGERERE\'S OPINION OF THE </p><p>VERACITY OF RUMORS THAT THE ACTING SECRETARY-GENERAL OF </p><p>THE ZCTU, ISIDORE ZINDOGA, WAS PRO-ZANU-PF, AND THAT THE </p><p>PARTY WAS PAYING THE DUES ARREARAGE OF CERTAIN UNIONS TO </p><p>THE ZCTU IN ORDER TO ENSURE ZINDOGA\'S ELECTION AS </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL.  MUDZENGERERE WOULD NOT DIRECTLY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ANSWER THE QUESTION.  RATHER, HE STATED THAT THE ZCTU IS </p><p>NOT OPPOSED TO ZANU-PF AS A POLITICAL PARTY.  THE ZCTU </p><p>IS AGAINST THE CORRUPT OFFICIALS WHO CURRENTLY CONTROL </p><p>ZANU-PF AND BELIEVES THAT THEY ARE OUT OF IDEAS FOR </p><p>RUNNING ZIMBABWE.  THE CURRENT NATIONAL LEADERSHIP HAD </p><p>BECOME SO ARROGANT, AND THEIR POLICIES SO ANTI-WORKER, </p><p>THAT THE ZCTU HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ITS MEMBERS TO </p><p>TAKE THE LEAD IN FORMING THE MDC AS AN ALTERNATIVE. HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT UNION MEMBERS KNOW THIS, AND THEY WILL </p><p>ELECT EXECUTIVE AND GENERAL COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO ARE PRO- </p><p>MDC. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) MUDZENGERERE INDICATED THAT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE </p><p>ZCTU CANNOT BE BOUGHT OFF BY ZANU-PF.  HE STATED THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS IN GENERAL ARE VERY FAITHFUL TO THE TOP MAN, </p><p>BUT ONCE THEY FEEL BETRAYED AND DECIDE TO ABANDON A </p><p>LEADER, THEY WON\'T GO BACK TO HIM.  THIS IS WHAT HAS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5583 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00612  02 OF 02  311445Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------BE6354  311445Z /38 </p><p>R 311443Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8156 </p><p>INFO DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000612 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ILAB FOR RSHEPHARD </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 01/31/11 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00612  02 OF 02  311445Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE LABOR FEDERATION OFFICIAL INSISTS THAT </p><p>LABOR STILL BACKS OPPOSITION MDC </p><p> </p><p>HAPPENED WITH THE UNIONIZED WORKERS IN ZIMBABWE.  THEY </p><p>HAVE BEEN BETRAYED BY MUGABE AND WILL THEREFORE NOT </p><p>SUPPORT HIM AGAIN.  HE ALSO INDICATED THAT UNIONS WILL </p><p>NOT BE INTIMIDATED INTO SUPPORTING MUGABE IN HIS </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL BID.  THE RURAL ELECTORATE, LESS EDUCATED </p><p>AND MORE ISOLATED THAN VOTERS IN URBAN AREAS, IS EASILY </p><p>INTIMIDATED.  ONE TACTIC PRACTICED BY ZANU-PF, ACCORDING </p><p>TO MUDZENGERERE, IS TO SHOW A PEASANT A CELL PHONE WITH </p><p>THE PEASANT\'S NAME ENTERED INTO IT, AND TELL THE PEASANT </p><p>THAT THIS "MACHINE" WOULD TELL WHO THE PEASANT VOTES </p><p>FOR.  UNION WORKERS ARE TOO EDUCATED AND CONNECTED TO </p><p>THE MODERN WORLD TO FALL FOR THIS TYPE OF TRICK.  THEY </p><p>WILL VOTE FOR THE MDC NO MATTER WHAT ZANU-PF DOES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: MUDZENGERERE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC </p><p>REGARDING THE INABILITY OF MUGABE AND ZANU-PF TO GARNER </p><p>A PERCENTAGE OF UNION VOTES ONCE THEY PULL OUT ALL THEIR </p><p>DIRTY TRICKS AND IMPLEMENT AN "URBAN" STRATEGY.  A </p><p>COMBINATION OF BRIBES, OFFERS OF PATRONAGE, AND COERCION </p><p>IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION IN THE RUN UP TO 2002. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE AGREE WITH HIS ASSESSMENT THAT ZANU-PF WILL </p><p>NOT WIN THE DAY AT THE UPCOMING FEBRUARY CONGRESS. </p><p>UNION WORKERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN MUDZENGERERE\'S </p><p>CATERING AND HOTEL WORKERS UNION, HAVE BEEN HAMMERED BY </p><p>THE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE BROUGHT ON BY MUGABE AND ZANU-PF. </p><p>THE WORKERS BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN BETRAYED, AND WILL </p><p>LIKELY ELECT A PRO-MDC EXECUTIVE AND GENERAL COUNCIL IN </p><p>FEBRUARY.  IN OUR OPINION, THE ONLY CHANCE ISIDORE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00612  02 OF 02  311445Z </p><p>ZINDOGA HAS OF BEING ELECTED TO THE TOP SPOT IS IF THERE </p><p>ARE MULTIPLE CANDIDATES FOR THE POSITION, THEREBY </p><p>SPLINTERING THE PRO-MDC VOTE.  IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL </p><p>HOW MANY CANDIDATES WILL EMERGE IN THE NOMINATION </p><p>PROCESS FOR THE POSITION OF SECRETARY-GENERAL, BUT WE </p><p>HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MDC LEADERS ARE WORKING BEHIND-THE- </p><p>SCENES TO ENSURE ZINDOGA FACES A SINGLE OPPONENT.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
