<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000427 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, NP, IN, Maoist Insurgency, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: INDIAN AMBASSADOR SAYS MAOISTS THREATENING </p><p>TO END DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 408 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d </p><p>) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary:  According to Shyam Saran, India\'s Ambassador </p><p>to Nepal, continued disagreement on the terms of a code of </p><p>conduct for the current cease-fire has led Maoists to </p><p>threaten an end to preliminary talks about future peace </p><p>negotiations with the GON.  At the heart of the disagreement </p><p>is the Palace\'s refusal to accept the Maoist demand that </p><p>government forces cease security operations.  In a March 7 </p><p>conversation with Ambassador Malinowski, Saran described the </p><p>Maoists\' ambiguous stance on the future of the constitutional </p><p>monarchy.  Saran reported that his Embassy has told Maoist </p><p>leaders that if they want a dialogue with Indian diplomats, </p><p>they must cease all illegal activity within India\'s borders. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) In a March 7 conversation with Ambassador Malinowski, </p><p>Indian Ambassador Shyam Saran disclosed that in discussions </p><p>with Indian Government (GOI) contacts the Maoists have </p><p>threatened to break off talks with the GON because of </p><p>disagreement on the cease-fire\'s proposed code of conduct. </p><p>According to Saran, a draft code of conduct by the Maoists, </p><p>vetted by the GON\'s advisory committee, contained a provision </p><p>prohibiting search operations by the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>and police forces.  The provision was rejected by the Palace, </p><p>with a handwritten note from King Gyanendra stating "this </p><p>does not apply to the RNA." </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Saran explained that the draft provision did not </p><p>explicitly require that the security forces "return to their </p><p>barracks," one of the Maoists\' reported demands.  According </p><p>to RNA Chief of General Staff Victory Rana, while the RNA is </p><p>not currently conducting specific search and destroy </p><p>missions, regular patrols continue.  If the patrols spot </p><p>unlawful behavior, including the carrying of arms or wearing </p><p>of Maoist uniforms, they intervene.  Comments by Brig. Gen. </p><p>Gaurav Rana (reftel), commander of the 5th Brigade in the </p><p>far-western region, corroborate this policy. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Ambassador Saran indicated that Indian diplomats in </p><p>Nepal are not in direct contact with the Maoists, but that </p><p>the GOI has opened other channels of communication with the </p><p>insurgents.  It was through these channels that the Maoists </p><p>had conveyed complaints about the late-February arrest of </p><p>several cadre in Patna, Bihar.  The GOI had responded that </p><p>"if you break the law in India you will get arrested," and </p><p>told Maoist leaders that if the party wants a formal dialogue </p><p>with India, they need to discontinue their activities south </p><p>of the border. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Saran indicated that the Maoists are being </p><p>intentionally ambiguous about their support for the </p><p>constitutional monarchy.  When asked, a Maoist source </p><p>reportedly replied that the insurgents "support multi-party </p><p>democracy" but are "mum" on the question of the future of the </p><p>constitutional monarchy.  When asked if remaining "mum" was </p><p>an indication of support, the source refused to elaborate. </p><p>On the issue of a constituent assembly, Saran said that </p><p>Maoist sources have stated that their advocacy of such an </p><p>assembly is "not written in stone."  The Indian Ambassador </p><p>agreed with Post\'s assessment that, should the Maoists decide </p><p>to abandon the peace talks, they would likely telegraph their </p><p>intentions by instructing their agents first to begin citing </p><p>incidents of alleged GON non-cooperation and publicizing </p><p>complaints against the negotiating team. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Comment:  Disagreement over the code of conduct could </p><p>presage a pattern familiar from the first round of talks: </p><p>impose an impossible demand on the GON and break off </p><p>negotiations when the government fails to meet it.  The King </p><p>is highly unlikely to hobble the RNA as demanded, especially </p><p>since the Maoists have not disarmed.  Rhetoric and complaints </p><p>are likely to increase in the coming weeks, with the Maoists </p><p>proclaiming their commitment to the talks and decrying the </p><p>GON\'s purported failure to cooperate.  History need not </p><p>repeat itself, however.  It is questionable whether the </p><p>Maoists are prepared to resume hostilities, and the King has </p><p>made it clear to us that he expects discussions with the </p><p>Maoists to be protracted.  Under such circumstances, </p><p>disagreements, posturing and threats are to be expected. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
