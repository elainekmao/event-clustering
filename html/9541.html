S./ ZIM RELATIONS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Back-to-back leading articles in the July 20 and 21 </p><p>      editions of the independent weekly "The Daily News </p><p>      on Sunday" and its sister daily "The Daily News," </p><p>      respectively, focus on the failing relations between </p><p>      the United States and Zimbabwe.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   The July 20 edition of the independent weekly "The </p><p>      Daily News on Sunday" focuses on an eerie blackmail </p><p>      statement by Robert Mugabe in which he warns the </p><p>      United States and the United Kingdom against </p><p>      invading Zimbabwe, saying if attacked "it will be </p><p>      their children who will be the first to die."  Under </p><p>      headline "Mugabe warns U. S.: `Attack us, we will </p><p>      kill your children\'" Godwin Mangudya, Senior </p><p>      Reporter, reports: </p><p> </p><p>      "As the U. S. and British pressure mounted on </p><p>      President Robert Mugabe to step down a fortnight </p><p>      ago, he told his supporters the children of the two </p><p>      countries\' citizens in Zimbabwe would be the first </p><p>      to die if they invaded this country as they did in </p><p>      Iraq.  Mugabe, facing political and economic </p><p>      turmoil, said Zimbabwe was ready to retaliate if the </p><p>      U. S. and the UK, implacable critics of his </p><p>      government\'s skewed policies, deployed their </p><p>      soldiers here to throw him out of power as they did </p><p>      Saddam Hussein.  Mugabe said in Shona: `Zvavakaita </p><p>      kuIraq havangambozviedza muno.  Anotanga kufa vana </p><p>      vavo muno. (They will never attempt to do here what </p><p>      they did in Iraq because it is their children who </p><p>      will be the first to die.)\'  He gave the warning at </p><p>      a political rally in the Chivi South constituency in </p><p>      Masvingo. . .The speech stunned many supporters, but </p><p>      was not given prominence in the government media. </p><p>      The privately owned media picked it up only after </p><p>      being alerted by those who attended the rally.  The </p><p>      exact quotation was transcribed from a tape of the </p><p>      speech made available to `The Daily News.\'  Mugabe </p><p>      did not elaborate on how the American and British </p><p>      children would die. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   President George W. Bush\'s inclusion of Zimbabwe among </p><p>      rogue states in a proclamation issued to mark "Captive </p><p>      Nations Week," made the lead story in the July 21 edition </p><p>      of the independent daily "The Daily News."   Excerpts of </p><p>      the article, picked from the South African-based News24 </p><p>      channel, follow: </p><p> </p><p>      "President George W. Bush on Friday hit out at six </p><p>      regimes on a United States blacklist he said was </p><p>      guilty of oppression and human rights abuses in </p><p>      Myanmar, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Zimbabwe and </p><p>      Belarus. . .There were also harsh words for North </p><p>      Korea, with which Washington has been locked in a </p><p>      nuclear weapons showdown since October. . .\'\' </p><p>      `Violence, corruption, and mismanagement reign in </p><p>      Zimbabwe. . .University of Zimbabwe (UZ) political </p><p>      scientist Eldred Masinungure said Bush\'s listing of </p><p>      Zimbabwe among the rogue states such as Myanmar was </p><p>      a sign of `the U. S.\'s anxiety for a solution over </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s slide into absolute authoritarian </p><p>      rule. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
