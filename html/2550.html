<p>S E C R E T KATHMANDU 000466 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PTER, PHUM, PREL, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: UIGHURS IN NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski.  Reasons 1.5 (b),(d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) At least 15 Chinese Uighurs have entered Nepal in the </p><p>last three months, according to a UNHCR protection officer </p><p>(strongly protect).  Six were taken into custody by Nepali </p><p>officials in late December, 2001.  Of these, four requested, </p><p>and received, UNHCR protection.  Three of the four were </p><p>subsequently handed over to China.  The fourth remains in </p><p>custody along with two who did not request refugee status. </p><p>The protection officer knows of approximately nine other </p><p>Uighurs currently at large in Nepal and seeking UNHCR </p><p>assistance.  UNHCR maintains regular contact with these </p><p>individuals. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Some of the Uighurs interviewed by UNHCR were able to </p><p>converse in Urdu.  One group claimed to have engaged the </p><p>services of a guide in China who smuggled them across the </p><p>Chinese border into Nepal at Kodari, a route commonly used by </p><p>undocumented Tibetans.  Of the Uighurs who made refugee </p><p>applications, all claimed to have been persecuted for their </p><p>political beliefs by the Chinese government. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) At a diplomatic reception March 1, the UNHCR </p><p>Representative to Nepal (protect) asked the Ambassador if he </p><p>"knew about the Uighurs."  UNHCR was aware of where these </p><p>individuals had come from, the Rep acknowledged elliptically. </p><p> Comment:  Post has heard rumblings about Uighurs from China </p><p>entering Nepal, but UNHCR\'s remarks were the first public </p><p>confirmation of this phenomenon.  Given the Rep\'s demeanor </p><p>and the fact that some could speak Urdu, we have strong </p><p>suspicions that some of these Uighurs may have spent some </p><p>time in Pakistan and/or Afghanistan.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
