<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000184 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA A/S ROCCA; ALSO PASS D AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 01/31/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, CE, IN, LTTE - Peace Process, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  Engaging the Indians on Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C/NF) While in Washington last week, I discussed </p><p>with the Deputy Secretary and with you the possibility </p><p>of our engaging with India on the subject of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>move toward peace.  In this connection, I present the </p><p>following thoughts for your review. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) As you know, Sri Lanka\'s peace process has </p><p>made immense progress since it began in December 2001. </p><p>There are recent signs, however, that the process may be </p><p>slowing down.  The LTTE seems to digging in its heels on </p><p>such issues as the "high security zones" in Jaffna.  In </p><p>the meantime, the LTTE\'s human rights record continues </p><p>to be very poor in such areas as the forced recruitment </p><p>of children.  There is also no indication that the group </p><p>has any intention of accepting political pluralism in </p><p>the areas under its control or in which it is seeking to </p><p>exert influence.  Meanwhile, in the south, </p><p>"cohabitation" tensions remain high and support for the </p><p>government\'s peace initiative could slide if the economy </p><p>does not pick up in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) Given this sensitive situation, it is vital </p><p>that the international community do what it can to keep </p><p>the peace process moving.  In this regard, we have been </p><p>told by countless interlocutors that the countries that </p><p>count to Sri Lankans -- and with the LTTE -- are the </p><p>U.S. and India.  At this point, we see the U.S. as very </p><p>well-positioned in Sri Lanka.  We have good relations </p><p>with the government and President Kumaratunga, </p><p>consistently using these ties to urge them to bridge </p><p>their differences.  We also have solid links with the </p><p>Tamil and Muslim communities.  And through our various </p><p>public statements and media interviews, we think the </p><p>LTTE knows precisely where we stand, especially </p><p>regarding our insistence that the group reject violence </p><p>and terrorism, and dispense with the idea of an </p><p>independent Tamil Eelam. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF) The situation regarding India is a completely </p><p>different matter.  India\'s attitude toward the peace </p><p>process has been reserved and correct.  Every now and </p><p>then it issues hortatory statements in support of peace, </p><p>but more often than not it is a silent observer and it </p><p>seems especially prone to criticizing developments not </p><p>to its liking, such as Japan\'s presumed role in the </p><p>process.  Overall, its policy toward Sri Lanka appears </p><p>extremely conflicted, favoring a stable situation in Sri </p><p>Lanka to be sure, but reluctant to do much to accomplish </p><p>that goal.  We know that this situation is explainable. </p><p>The burden of the past is a heavy one in light of the </p><p>casualties suffered by the Indian Peacekeeping Force in </p><p>1987-90 and the LTTE\'s brutal assassination of Rajiv </p><p>Gandhi in May 1991. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) That said, as the key regional player, it is </p><p>important that India assume a more active role regarding </p><p>Sri Lanka, especially in the months ahead.  To do this, </p><p>we recommend that the U.S. work to draw India into a </p><p>dialogue in which we begin to discuss our respective and </p><p>largely concordant views on the situation in more depth. </p><p>We want to provoke critical thinking in New Delhi, with </p><p>the object of getting the GoI to weigh in more </p><p>compellingly, thus reinforcing international efforts to </p><p>help resolve the Sri Lankan dispute.  In doing this, we </p><p>could underscore that an activist posture is truly in </p><p>India\'s national interest. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C/NF) We think, for example, that India could play </p><p>a key role in convincing the LTTE to take bold steps </p><p>toward disarmament and demobilization.  We say that </p><p>realizing that ties between India and the LTTE are now </p><p>seriously strained, and that there are complexities </p><p>involving Indian domestic politics, including in Tamil </p><p>Nadu and with Sonya Gandhi, that need to be dealt with. </p><p>Nonetheless, we sense that India\'s positioning is </p><p>crucial in terms of LTTE decision-making.  Put another </p><p>way, continued Indian aloofness gives the LTTE reason to </p><p>think that it can operate without much concern for the </p><p>views of a neighbor that is a stone\'s throw away over </p><p>the Palk Strait.  Moreover, in southern Sri Lanka, </p><p>Sinhalese extremists take heart from what they see as </p><p>India\'s seeming reluctance to back the peace process </p><p>wholeheartedly. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) In making the recommendation that we move to </p><p>activate a dialogue with India on Sri Lanka, we do not </p><p>have any specific ideas on what our engagement might </p><p>look like.  There are others in the USG who are much </p><p>better positioned to structure the dialogue.  Based on </p><p>what we have heard, however, National Security Adviser </p><p>Mishra seems to have assumed more of an activist posture </p><p>than some other Indian officials, including those in the </p><p>Ministry of External Affairs.  Given this, an in-depth </p><p>Sri Lanka-focused discussion with him might be a good </p><p>place to start. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
