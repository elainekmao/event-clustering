ON FEBRUARY 4, 2003, ESTOFF DELIVERED THE DEMARCHE </p><p>CONTAINED IN REFTEL C, REGARDING THE AUGUST, 10, 2002 </p><p>CANADIAN TAKING OF AN EASTERN BOWHEAD WHALE.

HE CONTINUED THAT THE UNITED STATES </p><p>RECOGNIZES THE NEEDS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND CONTINUES </p><p>TO ENCOURAGE CANADA TO REJOIN THE IWC AND SEEK AN IWC </p><p>APPROVED QUOTA.

ONE TAKING WAS ILLEGAL, BUT NO </p><p>PROSECUTION WAS POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH IT WAS CONSIDERED.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT CANADA CONDUCTS RIGOROUS RESEARCH ON THE </p><p>TWO EASTERN POPULATIONS (BAFFIN ISLAND AND FOXE BASIN) </p><p>AND ASSERTED THAT CANADIAN TAKINGS ARE CONSISTENT NOT </p><p>ONLY WITH A STABLE POPULATION, BUT IN FACT LEAVE ROOM FOR </p><p>GROWTH.  WONG INDICATED THAT THE GOC WOULD PRESENT AN </p><p>UPDATE ON THESE STUDIES AT THE NEXT IWC MEETING IN </p><p>BERLIN.   LINDER CLOSED BY NOTING THAT IT IS HARD TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND WHY THE U.S. WOULD EXPECT CANADA TO REJOIN THE </p><p>IWC AT THIS TIME GIVEN THE "ABUSE" THE U.S. TOOK AT THE </p><p>LAST IWC MEETING OVER U.S. INDIGENOUS WHALING. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
