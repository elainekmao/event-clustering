<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ALEXANDRIA 000721 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y ( HEADING ADDING ADDEES) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, KISL, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: ALEXANDRIA: CONSENSUS OF VIEWS ON </p><p>         THE PROBLEMS FACING EGYPT: THE ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  DURING A DAY-LONG SERIES OF </p><p>MEETINGS OCTOBER 17, CG SCHELL AND VISITING NEA/EGY </p><p>DIRECTOR SURBER HEARD FROM A CROSS-SECTION OF OUR </p><p>REGULAR LOCAL CONTACTS THAT THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM </p><p>FACING EGYPT TODAY IS THE ECONOMY, MORE SPECIFICALLY, </p><p>THE LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES.  OUR CONTACTS WERE </p><p>ALMOST UNANIMOUS IN THEIR VIEWS THAT ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST MILITANCY DERIVES MUCH OF ITS MOMENTUM </p><p>FROM THE FRUSTRATIONS AND HOPELESSNESS WHICH ATTEND THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION.  THEY ALL RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO </p><p>CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF ECONOMIC REFORM AND TO CREATE </p><p>JOBS AND A FUTURE FOR EGYPTIANS.  COMMENT: THOUGH NOT </p><p>NEW,  THEIR MESSAGE WAS NONETHELESS REMARKABLE FOR ITS </p><p>UNIFORMITY.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE ALEXANDRIANS WHO MET WITH NEA/EGY DIRECTOR </p><p>SURBER AND CG SCHELL OCTOBER 17 REPRESENTED A </p><p>CROSS-SECTION OF OUR LOCAL CONTACTS.  THEY INCLUDED THE </p><p>MAYOR OF ONE OF ALEXANDRIAS SIX DISTRICTS, THE DIRECTOR </p><p>OF AN A.I.D.-FUNDED SMALL BUSINESS PROJECT, SEVERAL </p><p>YOUNG AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN, A MEMBER OF THE SHOURA </p><p>COUNCIL, AND A MEMBER OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, WHO IS </p><p>ALSO AN ACADEMIC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  A CONSENSUS EMERGED FROM THE SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL </p><p>MEETINGS WE HELD; NAMELY THAT THE ECONOMY IS THE MOST </p><p>SERIOUS PROBLEM FACING EGYPT TODAY AND, SPECIFICALLY, </p><p>THAT THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM AND INCREASE THE ROLE OF THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR.  THE DISTRICT MAYOR, A HARD-WORKING </p><p>PUBLIC SERVANT HEAVILY-INVOLVED IN LOCAL PUBLIC WORKS </p><p>PROJECTS, STATED FLATLY THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM </p><p>WAS BEYOND HIS LOCAL RESOURCES.  THE A.I.D. PROJECT </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR, WHOSE PROJECT PROVIDES LOANS FOR SMALL </p><p>BUSINESSES, SAID THAT EVERY 1,690 L.E. (APPROX. USD 510) </p><p>HE LOANS CREATES ONE NEW JOB.  HE WAS AN AGGRESSIVE </p><p>ADVOCATE OF JOB-CREATION AND THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR IN RESTORING THE AILING ECONOMY.  HIS VIEWS WERE </p><p>ECHOED BY THE YOUNG BUSINESSMEN AND BY THE SHOURA </p><p>COUNCIL MEMBER, WHO ARGUED FOR EXPANSION OF THE </p><p>A.I.D.-FUNDED PROGRAM AND TOLD US THAT THE MAIN </p><p>CHALLENGE OF HIS COUNCIL WAS TO "CONTINUE THE PROCESS </p><p>(ECONOMIC REFORM) WHICH WE HAVE STARTED."  FINALLY, THE </p><p>PEOPLES ASSEMBLY MEMBER STRESSED THAT ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p>WAS NOT JUST A MATTER OF GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION AND </p><p>REDUCTION OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAD TO BE READY INVOLVE ITSELF IN </p><p>OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OUR CONTACTS ALSO AGREED THAT EGYPTS ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS, WITH THEIR ATTENDENT FRUSTRATION AND </p><p>HOPELESSNESS, WERE BEHIND THE RISE IN FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>MILITANCY AND VIOLENCE.  THEY NOTED THAT THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT INCLUDED A SOCIAL WELFARE </p><p>COMPONENT WHICH AIDES YOUNG EGYPTIANS IN THE PURCHASE OF </p><p>TEXTBOOKS AND IN THE QUEST FOR HOUSING, THUS APPEARING </p><p>MORE RESPONSIVE TO PEOPLES NEEDS THAN THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE ONLY POSSIBLY DIFFERING VIEW WAS THAT OF THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATOR WHO, WHILE IN AGREEMENT ABOUT </p><p>THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, ARGUED THAT EXCESSIVE </p><p>FORCE AND OVERREACTION BY SECURITY FORCES HAD ALSO </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED FUNDAMENTALIST POPULARITY AND </p><p>MILITANCY. (HER VIEWS ARE REPORTED SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT: ALTHOUGH OUR CONTACTS CAME FROM A VARIETY </p><p>OF BACKGROUNDS AND OUTLOOKS, THE SIMILARITIES IN THEIR </p><p>ANALYSES AND CONCLUSIONS WERE STRIKING.  NO ONE ARGUED </p><p>WITH THE BASIC PREMIS OF THE NECESSITY OF ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORM, NOR WITH THE PACE OF REFORM, YET ALL RECOGNIZED </p><p>THE POLITICAL DANGERS THE PROCESS OF REFORM COULD </p><p>BRING.  THEIR COMMENTS ON FUNDAMENTALISM WERE ALSO </p><p>REMARKABLY SIMILAR.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  NEA/EGY SURBER DID NOT REVIEW OR CLEAR ON THE TEXT </p><p>OF THIS MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHELL </p><p></p></div>
