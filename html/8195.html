<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002998 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>USDOC FOR MOLLY WILLIAMSON </p><p>CAIRO FOR AGCOUNS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, EAID, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S AMCHAM PLANS IRAQ SUPPORT EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  The Jordan-American Business Association is putting </p><p>together a program to support efforts by Jordanian companies </p><p>to assist in Iraq reconstruction efforts.  The centerpiece of </p><p>the plan, which envisions a host of activities both to get </p><p>Jordanian companies into Iraq and to sell Jordan as a </p><p>springboard for U.S. companies to enter the Iraqi market, </p><p>will be a reconstruction conference to be held June 5 in </p><p>Amman.  Interest in the local business community for such a </p><p>conference and related activities is high, and such a </p><p>conference should help to put Jordan in the minds of global </p><p>businesses looking for a safe, investor-friendly base from </p><p>which to explore business opportunities in Iraq.  We are </p><p>contacting Washington to discuss ways to support this </p><p>conference, including encouraging U.S. primary contractors </p><p>like Bechtel to participate.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  The Jordan-American Business Association (JABA, </p><p>Jordan\'s AmCham), has been developing a comprehensive program </p><p>to support Iraq reconstruction efforts.  This plan, which </p><p>they have dubbed "JUST for Iraq" (Jordan-US Trade for Iraq), </p><p>has two main goals:  first, to make Jordanian companies aware </p><p>of opportunities in Iraq (both commercial and contracting) </p><p>and to develop the capacity of local firms to take advantage </p><p>of those opportunities; and second, to launch an aggressive </p><p>campaign in the U.S. to "sell" Jordan as a base for U.S. </p><p>companies doing business in Iraq and to promote Jordanian </p><p>companies as potential partners for Iraq business. </p><p> </p><p>JUST for the Local Market </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  To realize the first goal, JABA plans to set up an </p><p>information desk, modeled on the FTA help desk they created </p><p>to support FTA implementation.  This desk will serve as an </p><p>information clearing house for all issues related to Iraq </p><p>reconstruction, including updated information about both </p><p>subcontracting opportunities and procedures under current </p><p>USAID contracts, and about commercial opportunities and </p><p>procedures for conducting private sector trade and investment </p><p>in Iraq.  JABA plans to offer this information as a public </p><p>service to members and non-members alike.  Supporting this </p><p>desk will be a website maintained by JABA with updated news </p><p>and links to all relevant Iraq reconstruction sites (note: </p><p>this site is a duplicate of the site developed by the </p><p>Embassy; once up and running at JABA, the Embassy will </p><p>reroute "hits" on our site to the JABA site.  End note.) </p><p>JABA also plans a series of workshops for interested members </p><p>and paying non-members to teach Jordanian companies how to </p><p>write subcontracting proposals, how to develop contacts in </p><p>Iraq, and the like - a sort of business development unit for </p><p>Jordanian SME\'s looking to break into the Iraqi market. </p><p> </p><p>Selling "Jordan, Inc." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  To realize their second goal, JABA is considering </p><p>employing a U.S. consultant to represent Jordan as an </p><p>investment and partnership destination for U.S. companies. </p><p>JABA hopes this consultant will be able to make the rounds </p><p>with the U.S. primary contractors for current USAID </p><p>contracts, with U.S. business associations, and with targeted </p><p>U.S. industry and service sectors, to sell the advantages </p><p>Jordan offers for U.S. businesses looking for local expertise </p><p>in launching business operations in Iraq. </p><p>5.  (u)  The plan is to highlight Jordan\'s close historical </p><p>and cultural ties to Iraq, its ability to communicate in </p><p>Arabic with Iraqi businesses, and its track record as the </p><p>only country in the world that traded with Iraq during the </p><p>sanctions era with international acquiescence - through the </p><p>oil and trade protocol and through ongoing small-scale </p><p>commercial transactions between grain traders in both </p><p>countries.  Other comparative advantages JABA will promote </p><p>will include:  a strong commitment to economic openness and </p><p>reform; several tariff preference programs, especially with </p><p>the U.S., including the FTA, a Bilateral Investment Treaty, </p><p>WTO membership, and one of the region\'s strongest IPR </p><p>protection policies; internationally-recognized multi-modal </p><p>transportation and logistics support, notably in Aqaba; </p><p>expedited visa services and no need for a local sponsor to </p><p>conduct business in the country (in contrast to most gulf </p><p>countries); relatively inexpensive, high-quality hotels and </p><p>conference facilities (roughly one-third of the cost of </p><p>comparable arrangements in the gulf); fair weather relative </p><p>to the rest of the region; and long experience as a supplier </p><p>of high-end services to the region, including in education, </p><p>engineering, architecture, IT solutions, and consultancy. </p><p>JABA will seek support in this effort from the Jordanian </p><p>Embassy in Washington to further these efforts, and may </p><p>arrange trade delegations to the U.S. (or invite delegations </p><p>to Jordan) in the future. </p><p> </p><p>Kicking Off a Reconstruction Conference </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  To kick off this program, JABA is hosting (along </p><p>with three other local business associations) a day-long </p><p>conference on Iraqi reconstruction.  JABA has been working </p><p>with USAID Amman, FCS, and ECON to develop the program and </p><p>recruit speakers.  They hope to gain support from several key </p><p>U.S. contractors to speak at the conference, notably Bechtel, </p><p>which is already sending speakers to similar conferences in </p><p>Washington, London and Kuwait in the same time frame.  They </p><p>are also reaching out to key NGO\'s and IO\'s to speak about </p><p>humanitarian assistance efforts, and are working with the </p><p>Jordanian Embassy in Washington to arrange a digital video </p><p>conference with Ambassador Kawar and select U.S. business </p><p>leaders to talk about future opportunities in Iraq.  There is </p><p>already intense interest for such a conference among the </p><p>Jordanian business community, which has been lamenting for </p><p>weeks the fact that reconstruction conferences appear to be </p><p>springing up all around them, while no similar program has </p><p>been developed yet for Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  Comment:  Many local businessmen have commented that </p><p>Jordan is a natural gateway to and partner for much of Iraq, </p><p>particularly for Baghdad and western and northern parts of </p><p>the country.  The port of Aqaba, for instance, has </p><p>traditionally been considered a "natural" Iraqi port, and </p><p>will likely be a major conduit for humanitarian, </p><p>reconstruction, and commercial goods into Baghdad and the </p><p>north for the foreseeable future.  In fact, port sources tell </p><p>us 65% of humanitarian assistance to date has transited </p><p>through Aqaba.  Support for this conference will be a shot in </p><p>the arm for JABA, but also for Jordanian businesses trying to </p><p>get the country "on the map" for U.S. primary contractors and </p><p>for potential U.S. commercial partners down the road - and </p><p>ultimately for Iraq as well, by building capacity to trade </p><p>and invest in an important traditional trading partner.  We </p><p>are contacting Washington agencies soon to discuss ways to </p><p>support this conference, including helping JABA recruit </p><p>speakers in the USG and the business community. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
