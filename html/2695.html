<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000620 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR U.S. MISSION </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, AORC, PREF, PHUM, NP, WFP, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: WFP AID FOR BHUTANESE REFUGEES: LEG UP ON NEXT </p><p>PHASE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. An extra multilateral contribution secured this week </p><p>from WFP Rome will fill a gap created by the delay in </p><p>receiving a USG shipment of in-kind food aid, reports the </p><p>WFP Deputy Country Director for Nepal.  The extra </p><p>contribution will have a carry-on effect for the next </p><p>phase of aid to the Bhutanese refugees, which runs from </p><p>July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2003.  As yet no contributions </p><p>have been pledged for the coming plan year, but the carry- </p><p>on means that WFP will have sufficient quantities of </p><p>primary commodities to see the refugees through most of </p><p>August, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>2. The story of the delay in the delivery of the in-kind </p><p>contribution has been circulating among UN and NGO staff </p><p>working in the refugee camps.  Several raised it with the </p><p>Ambassador during his visit to the camps March 25.  This </p><p>is the first time in-kind aid has been sent to the </p><p>refugees, and Post initially heard concerns that in-kind </p><p>aid would have a negative impact - both financially and </p><p>psychologically - on the local producers and suppliers </p><p>whose produce has fed the camp populations for ten years. </p><p>This view was not heard during the March 25 visit, </p><p>however.  To the contrary, one UN staffer speculated that </p><p>news of the in-kind delivery may prompt local suppliers </p><p>"to get their act together." </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
