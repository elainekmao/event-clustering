<p>UNCLAS SANAA 001934 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA DAS LAROCCO, NEA/ARP DJONES AND MMILLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, MARITIME SECURITY </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY SANA\'A PROPOSAL FOR PKO FUNDS </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (SBU) Below is the spending proposal from US Embassy </p><p>Sanaa for use of $5 million PKO funds in Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) We have three (3) objectives in using these funds: </p><p>(1) Continue to move forward with the Counter Terrorism fight </p><p>in Yemen and, as a second/third order effect, in the region, </p><p>(2) Provide an infrastructure for joint use by the Yemen </p><p>Navy/Coast Guard as part of the Maritime Security Strategy, </p><p>and (3) Preclude any involvement of North Korea in Yemeni </p><p>maritime affairs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The Yemen Maritime Strategy directs that the Yemen </p><p>Navy and Coast Guard work jointly to secure its ports and </p><p>interdict sea borne infiltration from the Red Sea. The Yemen </p><p>Coast Guard performs its mission out to 12 nautical miles </p><p>while the Yemen Navy works from 12 nautical miles and out. </p><p>Currently, the ROYG is standing up the Yemen Coast Guard with </p><p>EDA patrol boats from the USCG.  The ROYG has let a contract </p><p>to buy ten patrol boats from an Australian firm.  While these </p><p>are good first steps, no infrastructure exists to maintain </p><p>the boats over the long term.  Without this infrastructure </p><p>the new boats will quickly become inoperational and the </p><p>Maritime Strategy unworkable. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) Additionally, it is necessary to train the </p><p>officers and men of the Yemen Navy and Coast Guard.  English </p><p>language proficiency is a hugely lacking in Yemen.  We need </p><p>to take it upon ourselves to train these officers and men in </p><p>English so they can travel to the Unites States and undergo </p><p>training in our service schools.  This has the added affect </p><p>of immersing these officers and men in the US lifestyle and </p><p>professionalism of the US Armed Forces that they will bring </p><p>back to Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU) We have found that as we bring trainers in to </p><p>train the Yemen Armed Forces the Yemen soldiers do not have </p><p>the basic equipment of soldiering to include uniforms, boots, </p><p>helmets and other needed items.  We then lose valuable </p><p>training time as we buy essential items of equipment for </p><p>their use. We propose to stockpile uniforms, boots, helmets </p><p>and other equipment so as we begin to train these soldiers </p><p>they look and feel as if they belong to a professional unit. </p><p>This has a great impact on morale and professionalism. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) We propose to spend $4.45M on Yemen Navy/Coast </p><p>Guard infrastructure to include mobile repair shops, marine </p><p>travel lift, secure communications equipment, facility </p><p>establishment, engine repair parts, hull repair parts, </p><p>maritime skills training, and coastal security and counter </p><p>terrorism training.  Additionally, we propose to spend $350K </p><p>on English language training for up to 200 personnel and </p><p>$200K for basic and essential soldiering equipment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In a meeting with the Yemen Armed Forces Chief of </p><p>Staff, the Ambassador also reiterated the importance of </p><p>Yemeni understanding of USG sensitivities to any Yemeni </p><p>cooperation with North Korea in the construction of the </p><p>Yemeni navy port at Hodeidah.  (Ambassador will be meeting </p><p>with Minister of Defense on this subject next week.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) This proposal achieves the objectives outlined in </p><p>paragraph 1 above and also attains US goals and interests in </p><p>Yemen and the region.  Request approval of the proposal and </p><p>the release of the $5M PKO funds to Yemen. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
