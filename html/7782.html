<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002872 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, TU, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: APRIL 29 BELGIAN MINI-SUMMIT: TURKS SHARE OUR </p><p>CONCERN OVER SUMMIT\'S OUTCOME AND STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 109725 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U)  Classified by Political-Military Counselor Stuart Brown. </p><p> Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  On May 1, Polmiloff, drawing on reftel talking </p><p>points, briefed MFA/NATO Department Second Secretary Esra </p><p>Dogan on USG concern over the April 29 Belgian mini-summit </p><p>Joint Statement.  Dogan, who had also been briefed earlier </p><p>that day by the UK Embassy, said she was not surprised by the </p><p>mini-summit\'s outcome, though she had hoped that the Germans </p><p>would have played a role in working for a more "conciliatory" </p><p>Joint Statement.  Dogan said the GOT shares our concern and </p><p>is very disappointed and worried that "things are not going </p><p>in the right direction."  She explained that the French and </p><p>Germans at an April 23 Convention on the Future of Europe </p><p>Working Group on Defense submitted proposals along the same </p><p>lines as the April 29 Joint Statement.  Dogan said that these </p><p>French/German proposals will be finalized at the Convention\'s </p><p>next meeting on May 15.  Turkey, as an aspiring EU member, </p><p>participates in the Convention and its working groups.  Thus, </p><p>Dogan said that Turkey\'s EU Mission in Brussels has been in </p><p>close contact on this issue with the UK and hopes that </p><p>together their two countries can positively moderate the text </p><p>of the Convention\'s final paper. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Dogan went on to say that the Convention\'s final </p><p>paper does not have too much significance, as it reflects a </p><p>varied and large group including parliamentarians and </p><p>representatives from all aspiring EU candidates.  The real </p><p>decision on the EU\'s efforts to establish its own security </p><p>and defense identity will be decided at the EU\'s </p><p>Intergovernmental Conference, in which Turkey is not invited </p><p>to participate.  When this debate eventually takes place, </p><p>Dogan expects that the UK and the Dutch will fight to water </p><p>down any language that is at odds with long-standing NATO </p><p>commitments and the "Berlin-Plus" framework between NATO and </p><p>the EU approved in March. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
