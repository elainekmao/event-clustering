<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002446 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PHUM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW GOZ DIRECTIVE ON LAND ACQUISITION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary.  During a recent meeting with Commercial </p><p>Farmers\' Union (CFU) personnel, laboff received a copy of a </p><p>GOZ directive targeted at "cleaning up" the chaotic land </p><p>redistribution exercise.  This policy statement is directed </p><p>to the ad-hoc decisions and dealmaking which have </p><p>characterized the directionless land redistribution exercise, </p><p>whereby individual governors and District Administrators have </p><p>entered into widely varying agreements with commercial </p><p>farmers who are desperate to keep some portion of their </p><p>assets.  It also contains an oblique reference to allegations </p><p>that some ZANU-PF beneficiaries have claimed several farms </p><p>apiece.  Further, it clearly contradicts GOZ claims that </p><p>white commercial farmers would be allowed to keep part of </p><p>their land, that no white commercial farmer had been forcibly </p><p>evicted from his land, and that farms which are the only </p><p>property of commercial farmers would be exempt from </p><p>expropriation.  In this sense, the sentiment embodied in the </p><p>statement "One man, one farm" has morphed from a protective </p><p>policy for white commercial farmers into a warning statement </p><p>to indigenous Zimbabwean speculators.  Copy of the GOZ policy </p><p>statement follows.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>"Attention: - </p><p> </p><p>All Provincial Governors </p><p> </p><p>The Secretary of Local Government, Public Works and National </p><p>Housing </p><p> </p><p>The Secretary of Rural Resources and Water Development </p><p> </p><p>The Secretary of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affair </p><p> </p><p>All Provincial Administrators </p><p> </p><p>All Provincial Chief Land Officers </p><p> </p><p>All District Administrators </p><p> </p><p>All District Land Officers </p><p> </p><p>LAND REFORM PROGRAMME POLICY PRONOUNCEMENTS </p><p> </p><p>The Fast Track Land Resettlement exercise has been a mammoth </p><p>task which has had many challenges.  Cabinet, at its meetings </p><p>of 17th September 2002 and 15th October 2002, decided that </p><p>the 11 million hectares acquired compulsorily during the Fast </p><p>Track Resettlement Programme and the 3.6 million acquired </p><p>under the normal resettlement programme since 1980 stand as </p><p>acquired and now constitute STATELAND and cannot revert back </p><p>to their original status for any reason.  All officers </p><p>dealing with the Land Reform Programme should take note of </p><p>this decision. </p><p> </p><p>District and Provincial officers have given themselves </p><p>excessive powers to make concessions with farmers without </p><p>referring such decisions to the Minister of Lands, </p><p>Agriculture and Rural Resettlement who is vested with such </p><p>Land Authority powers.  This must stop forthwith. </p><p> </p><p>Cabinet has also resolved that:- </p><p> </p><p>1.  resettled farmers shall not be evicted from the 11 </p><p>million hectares they have settled on; </p><p> </p><p>2.  white farmers affected by the above-cited position shall </p><p>be accommodated elsewhere where they may be allocated </p><p>portions of land which are up to the relevant maximum farm </p><p>size and the allocation of the relevant maximum farm size </p><p>shall NOT be deemed as a right to any white farmer; </p><p> </p><p>3.  there shall be no ownership of rural agricultural land by </p><p>companies and that where such transfers have occurred in the </p><p>recent past, such transfers shall be rescinded by Government; </p><p> </p><p>4.  rural agricultural farms shall not be regarded as assets </p><p>of a company but must stand on their own and shall be </p><p>registered in an individual\'s name; </p><p> </p><p>5.  rural land under the A2 Model shall be leased; </p><p> </p><p>6.  all A2 leases shall be in the name of individuals and </p><p>shall not be in the name of companies; </p><p> </p><p>7.  A2 leases shall contain a condition regarding </p><p>Government\'s right to recourse in respect of the land in </p><p>question or a portion thereof; </p><p> </p><p>8.  Government suspends until further notice the issuing of </p><p>Certificates of No Present Interest in respect of all rural </p><p>agricultural land; </p><p> </p><p>9.  the subdivision of farms shall be undertaken without any </p><p>hindrance to Land Officers or influence from the white farmer </p><p>who may be allocated any of the resultant subdivisions; </p><p> </p><p>10.  white farmers shall not be grouped into an enclave as </p><p>and when they are resettled; </p><p> </p><p>11.  the planning, demarcation and resettlement of farms with </p><p>orchards, horticultural and agro-industries shall be done </p><p>with speed and requisite care; </p><p> </p><p>12.  the policy of one person/house hold one plot or farm </p><p>still holds in the interest of equity, justice and fair play </p><p>and shall be enforced; </p><p> </p><p>13.  future acquisitions and gazetting of rural agricultural </p><p>land for resettlement shall follow the already laid down </p><p>criteria and procedures which criteria and procedures shall </p><p>be respected; and </p><p> </p><p>14.  similarly, any material policy changes in respect of the </p><p>land acquisition process shall be channeled through the laid </p><p>down procedures </p><p> </p><p>(no signature) </p><p>N. Masoka </p><p>SECRETARY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MINISTRY OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE AND RURAL RESETTLEMENT" </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment.  The adjective "chaotic" is frequently used </p><p>to describe the resettlement program in Zimbabwe because </p><p>local officials are implementing redistribution patterns of </p><p>their own design.  While the governors of some regions -- </p><p>such as Midlands -- are attempting to craft a solution which </p><p>is sustainable, other regions have seen "solutions" which </p><p>resemble warlord politics, with white commercial farmers </p><p>bribing the highest official they can find in a desperate </p><p>attempt to salvage some of their property, or rival political </p><p>leaders promoting land invasions while other resist. </p><p>Ironically, such commercial farmers are still subject to </p><p>dispossession, with settlers and war veterans forcing </p><p>evictions whereby other arrangements, including High Court </p><p>judgments in the farmers\' favor, have been flagrantly </p><p>ignored.  CFU contacts also report that the Ministry has </p><p>directed that any recent sales of commercial farms from white </p><p>farmers to indigenous Zimbabwean farmers -- another attempt </p><p>by white commercial farmers to salvage part of their life\'s </p><p>work -- are null and void, with the land in question </p><p>remaining vulnerable to expropriation.  This latest directive </p><p>appears to be an attempt on the part of the Ministry of </p><p>Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement to re-exert some </p><p>level of central control over a wildly disorganized process. </p><p>Whether or not the Ministry is successful, commercial farmers </p><p>do not stand to gain any relief from this initiative.  As </p><p>evidenced by the language in this policy pronouncement, the </p><p>GOZ remains firmly committed to the destruction of white </p><p>commercial farmers and their concomitant political voice. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
