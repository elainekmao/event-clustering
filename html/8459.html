(SBU) Summary: Secretary General of the Italian </p><p>Privacy Authority Buttarelli expressed strong opposition </p><p>to the interim PNR agreement in a meeting with Econcouns </p><p>May 27. Buttarelli believes that Commission officials </p><p>made a mistake in agreeing to PNR as this violates </p><p>national laws.  The principal problems Buttarelli sees </p><p>relate to a foreign country\'s authorities being allowed </p><p>directly to access data held in Italy, as well as the </p><p>subsequent use of such data.  Buttarelli is, however, </p><p>optimistic that a satisfactory compromise may be reached </p><p>in the fall. Separately, regarding Safe Harbor, </p><p>Buttarelli provided statistics showing that the system is </p><p>seldom used by Italian companies and may soon be </p><p>obsolete.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>PNR </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) May 27 Econ counselor and Econ specialist met </p><p>with Italian Privacy Authority Secretary General Giovanni </p><p>Buttarelli to discuss Italy\'s position on PNR and Safe </p><p>Harbor.  The Italian Privacy Authority has been very </p><p>critical of the interim PNR agreement negotiated between </p><p>the U.S. and EU, and how this was handled by the </p><p>Commission.  Italian Privacy Authority chairman, Stefano </p><p>Rodota, recently wrote the Commission to this effect. </p><p>Buttarelli said that Brussels authorities had made a </p><p>mistake when they signed the PNR agreement, since this </p><p>violates national laws.  He also maintained that U.S. </p><p>officials have been misled regarding the value of a U.S.- </p><p>EU joint statement. This is not a treaty and may not </p><p>overrule national laws. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Buttarelli indicated that one key problem is </p><p>that the PNR agreement would allow a foreign government </p><p>to do what national authorities are not allowed to do. </p><p>He pointed out that "not even the head of the Italian </p><p>police has the authority to access flight information." </p><p>Buttarelli told EconCouns that only very recently has a </p><p>bill been presented in the Italian parliament to allow </p><p>police officers "who are physically located in airports" </p><p>to access flight information.  According to Buttarelli, </p><p>it is unacceptable and illegal that a U.S. authority, </p><p>"and not even necessarily a law enforcement official," be </p><p>allowed to access, from the U.S., data held in Italy. One </p><p>partial solution would entail relevant data being </p><p>transferred from Italy to the U.S. (as opposed to being </p><p>accessed from the U.S.)  However, in his view, even then </p><p>there would remain the problem of how the data is handled </p><p>and for what purposes it is used.  Adding to Italy\'s </p><p>concern is the fact that other countries, such as Canada, </p><p>Mexico and Australia, are considering similar measures to </p><p>those in the U.S.  This would be even more unworkable, he </p><p>stated. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Buttarelli, however, expressed optimism </p><p>regarding a possible compromise agreement.  He expects </p><p>that there will be a series of proposals tabled and that, </p><p>gradually, a compromise satisfactory to all would be </p><p>reached.  In late June or July, the EU Privacy </p><p>Authorities and the member states will meet to express an </p><p>opinion on proposals.  Buttarelli believes that an </p><p>informal agreement may be reached by September, but that </p><p>it is unlikely to be ratified by the EU parliament before </p><p>year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Regarding the related AFIS issue, Buttarelli </p><p>indicated that he has been approached by the ATAA (Air </p><p>Transport Association of America) regarding a possible </p><p>meeting for EU Privacy authorities in July in Washington. </p><p>Buttarelli indicated that he thought this was a good </p><p>idea, especially if appropriate USG officials either </p><p>joined in the ATAA meetings or held separate meetings </p><p>with the privacy authorities.  He was looking at a </p><p>possible two-day trip in early July.  One day could be </p><p>dedicated to discussion of AFIS/PNR.  A second half-day </p><p>could be dedicated to discussion of safe harbor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Safe Harbor </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Regarding Safe Harbor, Buttarelli believes that </p><p>this may be a good time to review the matter.  At the </p><p>same time, however, he quoted a recent survey conducted </p><p>among Italian firms, which indicated that 85 percent of </p><p>Italian companies transferring data to the U.S. adopt </p><p>consensus methods; most others use contracts, and only 3 </p><p>percent rely on Safe Harbor.  Buttarelli also told </p><p>EconCouns that a letter from U/S Aldonas had been </p><p>received in Brussels as a follow-up to the EU </p><p>Authorities\' visit to Washington in 2002 (reftel), but </p><p>that the content was not substantive.  He noted that a </p><p>DVC promised in the letter never took place. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment: Despite his opposition to PNR on </p><p>principal, Buttarelli appeared optimistic regarding a </p><p>possible compromise solution this year.  We are also </p><p>encouraged by his willingness to accept ATAA\'s invite and </p><p>by his desire to set up a July meeting with appropriate </p><p>USG officials.  Regarding Safe Harbor, Buttarelli remains </p><p>as critical as he has been from the start, and is </p><p>signaling that the system may become obsolete rapidly </p><p>through use of alternative (better, in his view) tools. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02436 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
