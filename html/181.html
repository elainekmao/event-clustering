<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L PRETORIA 17012 </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY CROCKER FROM AMBASSADOR PERKINS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: SF, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: MBEKI\'S RELEASE -- WHAT DOES IT MEAN? </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. I BELIEVE THAT THE RELEASE OF GOVAN MBEKI SHOULD </p><p>BE SEEN AS A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT TO LOOSEN UPTHE POLITICAL </p><p>GRIDLOCK IN THE COUNTRY ON THE KEY ISSUE OF </p><p>BLACK/WHITE DIALOGUE.  I SUSPECT, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>GESTURE AND THE OTHER RELEASES WHICH WE HOPE WILL </p><p>OCCURIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ARE AIMED MORE AT </p><p>DRAWING MODERATE INTERNAL BLACK LEADERS INTO A </p><p>DIALOGUE, RATHER THAN AT ENGAGING THE EXTERNAL ANC. </p><p>SIMPLE HUMANITARIAN AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS, </p><p>I.E., THE POSSIBLE DEATH IN PRISON OF AGED ANC </p><p>PARTIARCHS, ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN PRETORIA\'S GAMBIT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE HUMANITARIAN ANGLE </p><p> </p><p>3.  DFA DIRECTOR GENERAL NIEL VAN HEERDEN TOLD US </p><p>YESTERDAY JUST BEFORE MBEKI\'S RELEASE THAT TO SOME </p><p>EXTENT P.W. BOTH\'S DECISION SHOULD BE SEEN AS </p><p>SOMETHING "FROM ONE OLD MAN TO ANOTHER."  VAN HEERDEN </p><p>SAID THAT IN THE NOVEMBER 4 SAG SESSION WHICH </p><p>FINALIZED THE DECISION, P.W. SAID THE MAN IS SEVENTY </p><p>SEVEN YEARS OLD AND IN GOOD HEALTH FOR  A MAN THAT </p><p>AGE, BUT HE IS NOT A YOUNG MAN.  P.W., IN VAN </p><p>HEERDEN\'S VIEW, SEEMED TO BE MUSING OVER HIS OWN </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE TWILIGHT YEARS OF HIS LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  VAN HEERDEN SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO ARGUMENT </p><p>ABOUT THE UNCONDITIONALNATURE OF MBEKI\'S RELEASE. </p><p>THERE WAS ALSO GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT, IF ALL WENT </p><p>WELL, THIS WOULD BE ONLY THE FIRST STEP INA PROCESS </p><p>INVOLVING THE FREEING OF MORE ANC PRISONERS OVER THE </p><p>NEXT FEW MONTHS.  HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTION </p><p>MANDELA BUT OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT HE WOULD BE THE </p><p>FINAL ACT IN THE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE POLITICAL ANGLE </p><p> </p><p>5.  VAN HEERDEN STRESSED THAT IN A BROADER CONTEXT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IS WELL AWARE THAT THE SITUATION IS </p><p>"TUMBLING HEAD OVER HEELS TOWARD SOME KIND OF </p><p>CATASTROPHE.  A GESTURE OF SOME SORT WAS NEEDED TO </p><p>BREAK UP THE MOMENTUM AND BRING PEOPLE AROUND TO THE </p><p>NEED TO TALK. </p><p> </p><p>6.  CENTRAL TOTHIS CONTEXT IN MY VIEW IS THE </p><p>PERCEPTION INSIDE THE SAG,RECENTLY EXPRESSED TO ME </p><p>BY STOFFEL VAN DER MERWE, THAT CREDIBLE BLACK LEADERS </p><p>INSIDE SOUTH AFRICA SUCH AS BUTHELEZI HAVE PAINTED </p><p>THEMSELVES INTO A CORNER BY REFUSING TO NEGOTIATE </p><p>WITH PRETORIA UNTIL THE POOLSMORE/ROBBEN ISLAND </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO MEET THAT CONDITION. </p><p>HOWEVER, IN DOING SO, THERE IS NO INTENTION AT THIS </p><p>STAGE TO DEAL WITH THE LUSAKA AND. </p><p> </p><p>7.  I WOULD SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT STOFFEL HAS ANY </p><p>ILLUSIONS ABOUT AN IMPENDING SEA OF CHANGE IN BLACK </p><p>REJECTION OF CHRIS HEUNIS\' NATIONAL COUNCIL. </p><p>HOWEVER, IN PLAYING A LONGER TERM GAME VIS A VIS </p><p>INTERNAL BLACK POLITICAL FIGURES, THE SAG MUST FEEL </p><p>IT MAY NOW BE ABLE TO MOVE A FEW PIECES IN THE RIGHT </p><p>DIRECTION. IN THAT CONNECTION, INFORMATION DUPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR DAVID STEWART REMARKED TO US EARLIER THIS </p><p>WEEK THAT WHILE THE GOVERNMENT IS OPERATING FROM A </p><p>POSITION OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH,AT SOME STAGE A </p><p>POLITICAL DIALOGUE MUST TAKE PLACE, "IF NOT IN THE </p><p>NATIONAL COUNCIL, THEN IN WHATEVER FORUM FOLLOWS IT </p><p>OR WHATEVER COMES AFTER THAT." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OUR REACTION </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN SUM, WE SHOULD HEARTILY WELCOME MBEKI"S </p><p>RELEASE AS WE HAVE DONE AND GENTLY PRESS THE SAG TO </p><p>FOLLOW UP WITH OTHER PRISONERS IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. </p><p>(AT THE SAME TIME, WE MIGHT QUIETLY URGE THE ANC NOT </p><p>TO CROW VICTORY TOO LOUDLY.)  HOWEVER, WE SHOULD HAVE </p><p>NO ILLUSION THAT THIS PARTICULAR SAG STRATEGY -- </p><p>ASIDE FROM ATTEMPTING TO CLAIM SOME HIGH GROUND -- IS </p><p>IN A SENSE AIMED AT A NEAR TERM SAG/ANC DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>PERKINS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
