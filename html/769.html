<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 004074 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: DECL:  9/9/2000 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, KISL, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI CLERICS URGE OBEDIENCE TO KING, TAKE </p><p>          SWIPE AT ISLAMIC OPPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY: RIYADH\'S LEADING IMAM, TOGETHER WITH A </p><p>SHAYKH FORMERLY RENOWNED FOR PUBLICLY OPPOSING AL SAUD </p><p>POLICIES, RECENTLY ADVOCATED OBEDIENCE TO KING FAHD AND </p><p>UNITY WITHIN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY.   THE OCCASION, A </p><p>MOSQUE SEMINAR WHICH WAS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY COVERED BY </p><p>A SAUDI NEWSPAPER, MARKED BOTH THE RETURN OF A RADICAL </p><p>SHAYKH TO THE AL SAUD FOLD AND THE SAG RELIGIOUS </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT\'S SUPPORT FOR STRICT MEASURES TAKEN </p><p>AGAINST ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO UNDERMINE THE AL SAUD.  THE </p><p>SEMINAR COMES IN THE WAKE OF SIGNIFICANT DOMESTIC AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESS COVERAGE OF THE EXECUTION OF A CDLR </p><p>SUPPORTER ON THE CHARGE OF ATTEMPTING TO DIVIDE THE </p><p>MUSLIM COMMUNITY (UMMAH).  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ISLAMIC SEMINAR PROCEEDINGS AKIN TO FATWA </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  IN THE MOST RECENT EPISODE OF JOCKEYING BETWEEN </p><p>THE SAUDI RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT AND ISLAMIST CRITICS </p><p>OF THE REGIME WHICH BEGAN IN THE WAKE OF THE GULF WAR, </p><p>THREE SHAYKHS PROMINENT WITHIN THE OFFICIAL SAUDI </p><p>RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT BANDED TOGETHER IN A PUBLIC </p><p>APPEAL FOR OBEDIENCE TO KING FAHD AND UNITY WITHIN THE </p><p>SUNNI COMMUNITY.  THE TRIO\'S MOST VOCAL SPOKESMAN IS A </p><p>CLERIC ONCE NOTORIOUS FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE 1991 - </p><p>92 "MEMORANDUM OF ADVICE" AND "PEACE PROCESS" PETITIONS </p><p>- WHICH URGED THE KING TO JETTISON THE SAG-U.S. </p><p>RELATIONSHIP AND CHART A MORE AUTHENTICALLY ISLAMIC </p><p>COURSE - AND FOR HIS FLIRTATION WITH THE LONDON-BASED </p><p>COMMITTEE FOR THE DEFENSE OF LEGITIMATE RIGHTS (CDLR). </p><p>THE FORUM FOR THIS APPEAL, WHICH ATTRACTED COVERAGE IN </p><p>THE SEPTEMBER 2 ISSUE OF THE ARABIC-LANGUAGE SAUDI </p><p>NEWSPAPER "OKAZ," WAS A SEMINAR CONDUCTED AT RIYADH\'S </p><p>"GRAND MOSQUE" - THE LARGEST IN THE CAPITAL - HEADED BY </p><p>THE PATRIARCH OF THE AL-SHAYKH FAMILY, WHOSE MEMBERS </p><p>COMPRISE THE DESCENDANTS OF MUHAMMAD ABD AL-WAHHAB AND </p><p>CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE RELIGIOUS PILLAR OF THE SAUDI </p><p>STATE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SEMINARS ARE ROUTINELY CONDUCTED IN THE MAJOR </p><p>MOSQUES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND THEIR THEMES, ACCORDING TO A </p><p>LOCAL EMBASSY EMPLOYEE WHO FORMERLY TAUGHT AT THE IMAM </p><p>MUHAMMAD BIN SAUD RELIGIOUS UNIVERSITY, CAN BE A </p><p>FUNCTION OF A GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVE, A QUESTION FROM A </p><p>WORSHIPPER, OR A DECISION OF THE SENIOR IMAM.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE FACT OF A SEMINAR AND A REPORT OF ITS CONTENTS IS </p><p>RARELY PUBLICIZED.  THE COMBINATION OF THE PROMINENCE OF </p><p>THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED AND THE PRESS PLAY GAVE THE </p><p>SEMINAR\'S CONCLUSIONS THE FLAVOR, IF NOT THE LEGAL </p><p>STATUS, OF A FATWA, ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE. </p><p> </p><p>RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT REPRESENTED </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE COMPOSITION OF THE SEMINAR\'S INSTRUCTORS </p><p>WAS ARRESTING AS IT INCLUDED MAINLINE ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>FIGURES TOGETHER WITH A SHAYKH WHO, IN THE RECENT PAST, </p><p>CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THE REGIME FOR OPENLY </p><p>CRITICIZING AL SAUD POLICIES.  THE FOLLOWING ARE BRIEF </p><p>BIOS: </p><p> </p><p>-- SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ BIN ABDULLAH AL AL-SHAYKH: THE </p><p>BLIND, ELDER STATESMAN OF THE AL AL-SHAYKH FAMILY, HE </p><p>SITS ON THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF ULAMA AND IS THE IMAM OF </p><p>THE RIYADH GRAND MOSQUE - THE VENUE OF THE SEMINAR. </p><p>SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ IS A STALWART SUPPORTER OF THE AL </p><p>SAUD, WHO ABSTAINED FROM ALL OF THE PETITION DRIVES OF </p><p>1991-92. </p><p></p><p>-- SHAYKH ABDULLAH BIN ABD AL-RAHMAN AL-JABRIYN: A </p><p>SIGNATOR TO BOTH THE "MEMORANDUM OF ADVICE" AND THE </p><p>"PEACE PROCESS" PETITIONS, AL-JABRIYN\'S EARLY SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE CDLR RESULTED IN HIS OUSTER FROM THE SUPREME </p><p>COUNCIL OF ULAMA.  HOWEVER, FOLLOWING HIS HASTY </p><p>RENUNCIATION OF THE CDLR UNDER OFFICIAL PRESSURE, SHAYKH </p><p>AL-JABRIYN RETAINED HIS POSITION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>COMMITTEE FOR FATWAS AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.  IN A </p><p>RECENT ISSUE OF THE SAUDI WEEKLY PUBLICATION </p><p>"AL-MUSLIMUUN," AL-JABRIYN AUTHORED THE "FATWA" PAGE, </p><p>DISPENSING ISLAMIC GUIDANCE IN RESPONSE TO READERS </p><p>LETTERS - A SPOT USUALLY RESERVED FOR FULL-FLEDGED </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF ULAMA. </p><p> </p><p>-- SHAYKH SALIH BIN ABD AL-AZIZ AL AL-SHAYKH:  OUR </p><p>PRESUMPTION IS THAT SHAYKH SALIH, WHO IS A LECTURER ON </p><p>THE KORAN AT IMAM MUHAMMAD UNIVERSITY, IS THE SON OF </p><p>RIYADH GRAND MOSQUE IMAM SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ (ABOVE). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OBEY KING FAHD </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE SHAYKHS DREW TWO CONCLUSIONS: (1) ANY </p><p>DIVISIONS WITHIN THE SUNNI COMMUNITY WAS TO THE </p><p>DETRIMENT OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY ("JAMAA\'AT </p><p>AL-MUSLIMIIN"), OR MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS; AND (2) ALL </p><p>"PEOPLE OF THE MAJORITY" SHOULD FOLLOW THE LEADER (IMAM) </p><p>OF THE MUSLIMS.  IN THE SAUDI CONTEXT, THE PHRASE </p><p>"LEADER OF THE MUSLIMS" REFERS UNAMBIGUOUSLY TO KING </p><p>FAHD.  (IN FACT, IN MOSQUE SERMONS, A STANDARD FORMULA </p><p>FOR REFERRING TO SAUDI ARABIA\'S TWO SENIOR-MOST LEADERS </p><p>IS "THE LEADER OF THE MUSLIMS AND THE CROWN PRINCE...") </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  AL-JABRIYN\'S CONDEMNATION OF ISLAMIC FACTIONS </p><p>(OR SCHISMS) SUCH AS THE JAMAA\'AT AL-SUNNA, ANSAR </p><p>AL-SUNNA, AHL AL-TAWHID, AND JAMAA\'AT AL-TABLIGH SPARKED </p><p>DIPLOMATIC SPECULATION THAT HERETOFORE UNKNOWN ISLAMIC </p><p>POLITICAL OPPOSITION GROUPS HAD EMERGED IN SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p>HOWEVER, STUDENTS OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT HAVE CLARIFIED THAT </p><p>THE ABOVE-NAMED GROUPS REPRESENT SCHOOLS OF ISLAMIC </p><p>THEOLOGY MAINLY ACTIVE OUTSIDE SAUDI ARABIA.  THEY </p><p>CONSTITUTE STRANDS WITHIN THE BROADER SALIFIYYAH </p><p>MOVEMENT OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN USING ORIGINAL TEXTS </p><p>ONLY (THE KORAN AND THE SUNNA) IN INTERPRETING ISLAM. </p><p>THESE GROUPS ARE INACTIVE IN SAUDI ARABIA (THOUGH </p><p>DOUBTLESS ATTRACTING SOME SAUDI SYMPATHIZERS).  BUT </p><p>LOCAL OBSERVERS READ INTO AL-JABRIYN\'S COMMENTS THE </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF ANY OPPOSITION FORCE WHICH, WEARING THE </p><p>CLOAK OF ISLAMIC VIGILANCE, SEEKS TO DIVIDE THE MUSLIM </p><p>COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE SHAYKHS\' PAEAN TO THE IMAM, I.E., KING </p><p>FAHD, WAS REMARKABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF SHAYKH </p><p>AL-JABRIYN\'S PARTICIPATION.  THE SHAYKHS LECTURED THAT </p><p>ONLY IN THE INSTANCE OF A KING\'S EMBRACE OF ATHEISM WAS </p><p>IT APPROPRIATE FOR MUSLIMS TO TURN ON THE LEADER OF </p><p>THEIR COMMUNITY.  THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THE </p><p>"MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS," THEY ADDED, WAS THEIR OBEDIENCE </p><p>AND PATIENCE.  ONE OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF DIVISIVENESS </p><p>IS DISOBEDIENCE TO THE KING WHICH CAN RESULT IN GREAT </p><p>DAMAGE AND INTERNAL CRISIS WITHIN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  WE BELIEVE THE PRESS COVERAGE OF THE RIYADH </p><p>GRAND MOSQUE SEMINAR SERVED TWO PURPOSES:  IT </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED SHAYKH AL-JABRIYN\'S RETURN TO THE FOLD, AND </p><p>IT UNDERLINED THE SAUDI RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT\'S </p><p>SUPPORT FOR STRONG MEASURES AGAINST ANY INDIVIDUAL, </p><p>SECULAR OR ISLAMIST, ATTEMPTING TO UNDERMINE THE </p><p>LEGITIMACY OF THE SAUDI STATE.  THE LECTURE COMES IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLICITY, LOCAL AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL, PAID TO THE EXECUTION OF ABDULLAH </p><p>AL-HIDAIF, A SUPPORTER OF THE CDLR WHO, THOUGH CONVICTED </p><p>FOR MAIMING A POLICEMAN, WAS EXECUTED ON AUGUST 11 FOR </p><p>THE CRIME OF ATTEMPTING TO DIVIDE THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  THE SEMINAR ALSO REFLECTS AN EFFORT TO MEET </p><p>ISLAMIST CRITICS ON THEIR OWN THEOLOGICAL GROUNDS IN A </p><p>SOCIETY IN WHICH POLITICS OFTEN TAKES ON THE COLORATION </p><p>OF THEOLOGICAL DEBATE.  WHILE HARD-CORE CRITICS MAY </p><p>REMAIN UNPERSUADED, THE SEMINAR\'S ORGANIZERS MAY HOPE </p><p>THAT RESTORING THE PATINA OF RELIGIOUS LEGITIMACY ON </p><p>RULE BY THE AL SAUD WILL INFLUENCE LESS COMMITTED </p><p>SKEPTICS AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE.   END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KATTOUF </p><p></p></div>
