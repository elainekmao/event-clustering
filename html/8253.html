<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001474 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CA, FR </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA-FRANCE: VISIT OF FRENCH PM RAFFARIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  HANDLE APPROPRIATELY. </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) DFAIT Director General for Western Europe Cecile </p><p>Latour and Deputy Director Denis Robert characterized the </p><p>brief (less than 24 hours) visit of French PM Raffarin to </p><p>Ottawa as an unqualified success. The visit originally was </p><p>conceived around Quebec\'s May 21-23 hosting of the annual </p><p>meeting of Futurallia, an international business alliance </p><p>(SME networking and "matchmaking") launched in Poitiers, </p><p>France, in 1989. Raffarin apparently took a vivid interest in </p><p>the development of Futurallia during his time as President of </p><p>Poitou-Charente region. Though the focus of the visit was </p><p>primarily bilateral cooperation in a number of areas -- </p><p>including strong French interest in Canada as a model for </p><p>"decentralization" of the government -- PM Chretien did </p><p>commit to support a UN-led intervention in the Congo (a </p><p>"small contribution"), should one come to pass. </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) In a joint communique on May 22, Raffarin and Chretien </p><p>welcomed the UNSC resolution on Iraq reconstruction as a </p><p>"credible framework" for mobilizing the international </p><p>community to assist in reconstruction of Iraq. They affirmed </p><p>the central role of the UN and Security Council in the </p><p>"collective treatment of regional crises and in responding to </p><p>the challenge posed by the risks of proliferation of weapons </p><p>of mass destruction" and confirmed support for implementation </p><p>of the MEPP Roadmap proposed by the diplomatic Quartet. The </p><p>two PMs declared the importance of a "new-generation </p><p>agreement" on Canadian trade and investment with the EU, and </p><p>mutual commitment to bilateral efforts ensuring the success </p><p>of the Doha Round.  They reaffirmed commitment to prioritize </p><p>development in Africa through the G8 Africa Action Plan, as </p><p>affirmed at the Kananaskis summit, and agreed to "further </p><p>develop" dialogue on implementation of Kyoto Protocol </p><p>commitments. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) During the joint press conference on Thursday, </p><p>Raffarin praised the UNSC resolution on Iraq reconstruction </p><p>as a very promising sign for the future. He asserted France\'s </p><p>solidarity with the U.S. -- particularly in the wake of the </p><p>bombings in Riyadh and Morocco -- in combating terrorism and </p><p>proliferation.  The francophone newspaper La Presse reported </p><p>that while Chretien also saw the resolution as a positive </p><p>development toward enabling Iraq to regain its autonomy, he </p><p>nonetheless reiterated that he disagreed with the manner in </p><p>which the U.S. had imposed its will on the situation, noting </p><p>that this was "not the customary way to change a regime." </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
