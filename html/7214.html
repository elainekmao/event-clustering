<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ACCRA 000676 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, ABIDJAN AND NAIROBI FOR REFCOORDS, ROME FOR </p><p>DHS, GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: GA, GH, INS, IO, PREF, refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: CORRUPTION INSPECTION OF IOM/BANJUL COMPLETED </p><p> </p><p>REF: ACCRA 501 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Refcoord for Admissions Carla T. Nadeau for reasons 1.5 </p><p>b and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  West African Regional Refugee Coordinator </p><p>for Admissions met with International Organization for </p><p>Migration (IOM) Head of Mission to discuss the findings of </p><p>the recent inspector general\'s investigation at IOM branch </p><p>office Banjul.  The team concluded that fraud concerns only </p><p>reached the Canadian resettlement program.  While no solid </p><p>evidence of wrongdoing was uncovered, the IG team left Banjul </p><p>sufficiently suspicious to recommend a down-sizing and </p><p>restructuring of the office to include the removal of the </p><p>staffer in question.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Upon his return from consultations in Geneva, HOM </p><p>Antonio Palosa debriefed Refcoord on the findings of the </p><p>recent IG investigation of IOM Branch Office Banjul. </p><p>Relieved that the concerns outlined in ref a. only reached </p><p>the Canadian program, Palosa appeared confident that fraud </p><p>had not tainted the US Refugee Program (USRP).  Providing a </p><p>brief readout of the investigation, Palosa relayed concerns </p><p>about lack of corroborating testimony from refugees.  Upon </p><p>hearing of the arrival of the investigatory team, refugees </p><p>deliberately maintained a very low profile providing little </p><p>concrete testimony of the alleged fraud perpetrated by </p><p>staffer Gomez.  Despite the lack of detailed testimony, the </p><p>IG uncovered other, potentially damaging evidence that </p><p>something was amiss at the office.  Specifically, Gomez had </p><p>over 20 refugee case files for the Canadian program in her </p><p>desk drawer that should have been handed over to the </p><p>Canadians.  The files were at various stages of the </p><p>resettlement process and there was no reasonable explanation </p><p>as to why these specific cases were held up. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Palosa expects that the IOM/Banjul office will be </p><p>re-shuffled and down-sized.  Although the IG staff </p><p>recommended the firing of Gomez, their recommendation must be </p><p>approved by their IG superiors in Geneva.  Assuming this </p><p>approval will come through, Palosa believed that Gomez will </p><p>be one of a significant number of staff to lose their job. </p><p>Noting that there are not many cases left in Banjul that need </p><p>to depart, IOM is using this opportunity to down-size and </p><p>leave a more appropriately sized staff of only two or three </p><p>to run operations. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  While it is certainly good news that IOM </p><p>does not believe the alleged fraud reached the USRP and also </p><p>that remedial action is being taken, refugee watchers should </p><p>maintain close scrutiny of the office.  As little evidence </p><p>was provided by affected refugees, IOM has not managed to </p><p>discover the true depth of the alleged fraud.  Furthermore, </p><p>given the refugees\' reluctance to speak, it remains to be </p><p>seen if there has been some sort of quid pro quo for their </p><p>silence.  End comment. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
