THE FOURTH SESSION WAS DEVOTED TO INCONCLUSIVE </p><p>DISCUSSION OF LENGTH OF TERM AND THE QUESTION OF TRANSITION </p><p>MEASURES.  THE G-77 RALLIED AROUND A SIX-YEAR TERM AND THE </p><p>OECD MEMBERS REITERATED SUPPORT FOR A FOUR-YEAR TERM.  ON </p><p>TRANSITION MEASURES, THE U.S., NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA </p><p>ARGUED FOR A SPECIFIC PROHIBITION ON THE INCUMBENT RUNNING </p><p>AGAIN.  THE EU PUT FORWARD ITS PROPOSAL THAT THE DG BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO RUN FOR ONE MORE TERM ONLY.  THE AFRICAN GROUP </p><p>RESPONDED INDIGNANTLY THAT THEY WOULD NOT "NEGOTIATE THE </p><p>RIGHTS OF THE DG" TO RUN AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BRAZIL STATED SPECIFICALLY THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO </p><p>REFERENCE TO THE INCUMBENT IN THE PROPOSAL.  THE FAO LEGAL </p><p>ADVISER RECONFIRMED THAT SILENCE ON WHAT HAD BEEN CALLED </p><p>"TRANSITION" MEASURES WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN THAT THE </p><p>CURRENT DIRECTOR GENERAL WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED RETROACTIVELY </p><p>BY THE AMENDMENT TO THE BASIC TEXTS, AND THEREFORE COULD RUN </p><p>AGAIN AND BE TREATED ON THE SAME BASIS AS OTHER CANDIDATES. </p><p>AMBASSADOR MEKOUAR SUMMARIZED THAT IF THE CHANGE TO THE </p><p>BASIC TEXTS WAS "NOT DIRECTED AT THE CURRENT INCUMBENT" THEN </p><p>PERHAPS THE CURRENT INCUMBENT SHOULD NOT BE MENTIONED AT </p><p>ALL. </p><p> </p><p>FIFTH SESSION </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE FIFTH AND FINAL SESSION OF THE FRIENDS OF THE CHAIR </p><p>MET SATURDAY, MARCH 27.  ALL MEMBERS AGREED THAT THERE </p><p>SHOULD BE A TWO TERM MAXIMUM.  ON LENGTH OF TERM, MEMBERS </p><p>RESTATED POSITIONS: G-77: 6 PLUS 6, OECD: 4 PLUS 4.  THE </p><p>U.S., CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA STATED THAT THEY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01558  01 OF 02  111415Z </p><p>COULD ALSO CONSIDER A 10 YEAR MAXIMUM.  THE AFRICAN GROUP </p><p>LEADER STATED CATEGORICALLY THAT SHE "WOULD NOT TAKE BACK </p><p>THE FOUR YEAR OPTION" TO HER GROUP.  BRAZIL STRONGLY URGED </p><p>FOR 6 PLUS 6, ARGUING THAT 6 PLUS 4 INTRODUCED AN </p><p>INAPPROPRIATE "POLITICAL ELEMENT" TO THE DISCUSSION AS IT </p><p>PLACED AN INCUMBENT ON DIFFERENT TERMS FROM NEW CANDIDATES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  LEAVING THE LENGTH OF TERM ASIDE, AMBASSADOR MEKOUAR </p><p>TURNED THE GROUP TO DISCUSSION OF "TRANSITION MEASURES." </p><p>THE EU RESTATED ITS POSITION OF ALLOWING THE INCUMBENT TO </p><p>RUN FOR ONE TERM ONLY, BUT ADDED THAT IT COULD ALSO SUPPORT </p><p>SILENCE ON TRANSITION MEASURES.  OTHER OECD MEMBERS STATED </p><p>THAT THEY COULD ACCEPT SILENCE AND THE G-77 AGREED AS WELL, </p><p>NOTING THAT THE IMPORTANT ISSUE WAS NOT TO "DISCRIMINATE </p><p>AMONG CANDIDATES IN ANY WAY." </p><p> </p><p>7.  TURNING BACK TO LENGTH OF TERM, AMBASSADOR MEKOUAR ASKED </p><p>IF MEMBERS COULD SUPPORT TWO TERMS, THE FIRST BEING SIX </p><p>YEARS, AND THE SECOND FOUR.  THE GROUP AGREED TO THE </p><p>PROPOSAL, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AUSTRALIA, WHO NOTED THAT </p><p>THE DECISIONS WAS AD REFERENDUM AND HE WOULD NEED TO CONSULT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0036 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01558  02 OF 02  111415Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   WHA-00   EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   UTED-00  FDRE-01  TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   SS-00    TEST-00  DRL-01   SAS-00 </p><p>        /005W </p><p>                  ------------------54589A  111439Z /38 </p><p>R 111410Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9220 </p><p>INFO USDA FAS WASHDC 2614 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3192 </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001558 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA SHARON KOTOK, SETH WINNICK </p><p>USDA/FAS LYNN REICH, DICK HUGHES </p><p>MEXICO CITY FOR BRAKEL </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, FAO, KUNR </p><p>SUBJECT:  FAO TERM LIMITS: AGREEMENT ON 10 YEAR MAXIMUM AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01558  02 OF 02  111415Z </p><p>NO TRANSITION MEASURES </p><p> </p><p>HIS CAPITAL AS HIS INSTRUCTIONS ONLY WENT SO FAR AS </p><p>SUPPORTING A TERM OF FOUR YEARS (RENEWABLE ONCE). </p><p> </p><p>ON TO COUNCIL </p><p>------------- </p><p>8.

THE ELECTIONS FOR </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL WILL BE AT THE CONFERENCE SESSION IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 2005. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>9.  THE OUTCOME DOES NOT BAR THE CURRENT DG FROM RUNNING </p><p>AGAIN, OR LIMIT ANY RUN TO JUST ONE TERM (AS THE EU HAD </p><p>INITIALLY HOPED).  ON THE OTHER HAND, WE SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>AVOIDED ANY ENDORSEMENT, IMPLICIT OR OTHERWISE, OF THE DG\'S </p><p>CANDIDACY SHOULD HE RUN AGAIN.  IN ADDITION, THE FIVE </p><p>SESSIONS OF THE FRIENDS OF THE CHAIR PROVIDED AMPLE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MAJOR DONORS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT, WERE </p><p>THE DIRECTOR GENERAL RUN AGAIN, HE WOULD NOT ENJOY THE </p><p>SUPPORT OF THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH FUND THE LION\'S SHARE OF </p><p>THE FAO\'S BUDGET.
