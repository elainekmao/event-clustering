This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for November 26, 2002.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  PRO-OCALAN PROTEST IN ADANA </p><p>(Evrensel)  A group of youths who call themselves </p><p>"Democratic Uprising Youth" gathered in Seyhan\'s </p><p>(Adana) Yenibey quarter on November 24 to protest </p><p>PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan\'s isolation.  During </p><p>the demonstration, they lit fires, closed the </p><p>main road to traffic and shouted pro-Ocalan </p><p>slogans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  DRIVE TO SPEAK IN KURDISH </p><p>(Evrensel)  Centennial University (Van) students </p><p>launched a campaign to speak in Kurdish on the </p><p>campus over the next two days to mark the first </p><p>anniversary of the Mother-tongue Education </p><p>Campaign.  The students will not participate in </p><p>class interactions and will not respond to their </p><p>professors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  BAN ON KURDISH NAME </p><p>(Evrensel)  Mersin Birth Registry Directorate </p><p>denied Mersin resident Mehmet Emin Aydin </p><p>permission to give the name "Jelya" to his </p><p>newborn daughter, claiming it is "not Turkish." </p><p>Aydin called the decision "unlawful" and "a </p><p>family choice."  Aydin said he would pursue all </p><p>legal avenues, including the European Court of </p><p>Human Rights, to assert his rights.  Hurriyet </p><p>cited the new Culture Minister, Huseyin Celik, as </p><p>saying that all kinds of names could be given to </p><p>children as long as they did not connote </p><p>animosity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  ELECTRICITY THIEVES ARRESTED </p><p>(Evrensel)  In Diyarbakir, 19 Turkish Electricity </p><p>Distribution Corporation (TEDAS) subscribers were </p><p>arrested for illegal use of electricity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  OHAL PAYMENTS TO CONTINUE AFTER OHAL\'S </p><p>ABOLITION </p><p>(Sabah)  The State of Emergency (OHAL), put in </p><p>effect in Eastern and Southeastern Turkey in </p><p>1987, will be lifted in Diyarbakir and Sirnak on </p><p>November 30 in line with a recent decision made </p><p>by the Turkish National Security Council (MGK). </p><p>The Interior Ministry has come up with a formula </p><p>to shift to "Critical Province" practice in the </p><p>Southeast after OHAL\'s abolition.  The new </p><p>formula will allow OHAL compensation payments </p><p>made to personnel serving in the region to </p><p>continue.  (Note:  Such payments are similar to </p><p>"danger pay.")  These payments were designed to </p><p>encourage personnel serving in the region and the </p><p>new formula is intended to avoid a possible </p><p>shortage of personnel in the future.  The </p><p>Ministry has included Diyarbakir, Sirnak, </p><p>Hakkari, Mus, Van, Bingol, Mardin, Bitlis, Siirt, </p><p>Tunceli and Batman on the list of "Critical </p><p>Provinces."  After November 30, OHAL Governor\'s </p><p>Office will reportedly be replaced with a </p><p>"Coordinator Governorate," similar to those used </p><p>in disaster areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  NEW COMMERCIAL CREDIT AGREEMENT SIGNED </p><p>(Turkiye)  The Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce </p><p>signed a protocol agreement with Is Bank in an </p><p>effort to contribute to anticipated economic </p><p>growth and revival.  Under the agreement, Is Bank </p><p>will provide chamber members with commercial </p><p>credits totaling up to TL 60 billion (approx. USD </p><p>40,000) each. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  INCREASE IN WATER PRICE </p><p>(Hurriyet/Milliyet/Turkiye)  Adana Municipality\'s </p><p>Water and Sewage Administration (ASKI) increased </p><p>the price of city water by 28%.  With the </p><p>increase, the price of per cubic meter of water </p><p>rose from TL 781,000 (approx. USD 0.50) to TL 1 </p><p>million (approx. USD 0.64). </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
