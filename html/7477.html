SUMMARY:  THE MEETING OF IRAQI LEADERS NEAR AL NASSERIYA, </p><p>IRAQI DEMONSTRATIONS IN BAGHDAD, MOSUL, AND AL NASSERIYA, AND </p><p>U.S. WARNINGS TO SYRIA DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA. </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL\'S FOREIGN PRESS CENTER REMARKS AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF THE LOOTING OF BAGHDAD\'S MUSEUMS AND LIBRARIES </p><p>ALSO RECEIVED PROMINENT COVERAGE.  MEANWHILE, THE POTENTIAL ROLE </p><p>OF ARAB COUNTRIES IN REBUILDING IRAQ WAS THE MAJOR THEME OF </p><p>TODAY\'S EDITORIALS.  AN "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL URGED ARABS TO </p><p>RECOGNIZE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR IRAQ.  IN "AL KHALEEJ," </p><p>COLUMNIST KAMEL ZUHAIR ASSERTED THAT SECRETARY RUMSFELD WAS THE </p><p>ONLY PERSON TO DEFEND THE LOOTING IN IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" CARRIED </p><p>A FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE THAT REPORTED DONALD RUMSFELD\'S STATEMENTS </p><p>COMPARING THE LOOTING OF BAGHDAD\'S MUSEUMS AND LIBRARIES TO </p><p>LOOTING OCCASIONALLY OCCURRING AT OR AFTER SPORTING EVENTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON U.S. WARNINGS TO SYRIA AND URGING AN ARAB ROLE </p><p>IN CONFRONTING THESE THREATS, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL- </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 4/16: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE EARTHQUAKE IN IRAQ CREATED AN UNBALANCED SITUATION, BUT </p><p>THERE IS A CHANCE TO REUNITE ALL THAT HAVE BEEN SCATTERED, ALSO </p><p>THERE ARE ABILITIES AND CAPABILITIES FROM WHICH THEY CAN BENEFIT. </p><p>THE ARABS MUST REALIZE THAT SYRIA IS NOT THE ONLY TARGET, AND </p><p>THAT PROTECTING IT IS PROTECTING WHAT REMAINS ON A LONG AMERICAN- </p><p>ZIONIST LIST, REGARDLESS OF THE VIOLENT AND BRUTAL ATTACKS ... </p><p>OTHERWISE, THE IMPRISONING OF ARABS THAT BEGAN IN PALESTINE AND </p><p>CONTINUED TO IRAQ WILL NOT BE LIMITED TO ANY BORDERS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  DESCRIBING SECRETARY RUMSFELD AS "THE ENGINEER OF WAR," </p><p>COLUMNIST KAMEL ZUHAIR WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON 4/16: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE ONLY PERSON DEFENDING THE LOOTING AND STEALING IN IRAQ </p><p>WAS THE ENGINEER OF WAR, RUMSFELD, WHO FOR THE FOURTH TIME GOT </p><p>FED UP WITH THE MEDIA AND ITS TRANSMISSION OF NEWS AND PICTURES </p><p>... RUMSFELD STATED THAT IRAQ WILL MOVE FROM A POLICE STATE TO A </p><p>LIBERATED COMMUNITY THAT EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH LOOTING AND </p><p>STEALING.  THE STRATEGIC THINKER RUMSFELD KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT </p><p>WARS OF OCCUPATION AND NOTHING ABOUT WARS FOR LIBERATION ..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  URGING AN ARAB ROLE IN REBUILDING IRAQ, SEMI-OFFICIAL ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 4/16: </p><p> </p><p>"... IF ARAB COUNTRIES AND THEIR LEADES DON\'T FAMILIARIZE </p><p>THEMSELVES WITH THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, TO WHICH THEY ARE OBLIGED </p><p>BY BLOOD, RELIGION, LANGUAGE, AND HISTORICAL CONNECTIONS WITH </p><p>THEIR BROTHERS (IN IRAQ), THEN THE REBUILDING OF IRAQ </p><p>POLITICALLY, ECONOMICALLY, AND SOCIALLY IS IN DANGER.  THIS </p><p>DANGER THREATENS NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ BUT ALSO SYMBOLIZES </p><p>A GREAT ADVERSARY TO ARAB POWER AND ARAB CAPABILITIES, AT A TIME </p><p>WHEN ARABS ARE TRYING TO RISE IN THESE DARK MOMENTS FROM THEIR </p><p>STUMBLINGS THAT THREATENS THEIR PRESENT AND FUTURE." </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN A CLOSING STATEMENT, SALEM WROTE IN "AL-KHALEEJ" ON 4/16: </p><p> </p><p>"BURNING THE \'DAR AL HEKMA\' NATIONAL LIBRARY IN IRAQ, IN ADDITION </p><p>TO LOOTING AND BURNING THE REST OF THE LIBRARIES IN MOSUL AND </p><p>BASRA, IS NOT A RECKLESS ACTION AND SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE </p><p>LIST OF LOOTING DONE BY BURGLARS AND THIEVES.  THESE FIRES WERE </p><p>MEANT TO ERADICATE A CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE THAT GOES BACK </p><p>THOUSANDS OF YEARS ... IT IS A GREAT CRIME COMMITTED BY THE NEW </p><p>OCCUPIER IN ORDER TO DESTROY THE CULTURE AND HISTORY OF </p><p>MESOPOTAMIA AND GIVING BIRTH TO A NEW CULTURE FROM THE WOMB OF </p><p>OCCUPATION.  WHAT HAPPENED MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS CONTEXT." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "AL KHALEEJ" CARRIED A FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE UNDER THE HEADLINE </p><p>"NEW AMERICAN CURRICULUM IN IRAQ ENDS PRIMACY OF THE ARABIC </p><p>LANGUAGE."  DESPITE THE HEADLINE, THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZED THAT THE </p><p>PRIMARY U.S. AIM IS TO SEPARATE POLITICS FROM EDUCATION AND "DE- </p><p>BA\'ATHIFY" THE CURRENT SYSTEM.  THE ARTICLE REPORTED THAT THE NEW </p><p>U.S. SYSTEM WILL UTILIZE MULTIPLE LANGUAGES FOR INSTRUCTION AND </p><p>WILL REFORM CURRENT TEACHING METHODS AND CURRICULA.  THE ARTICLE </p><p>ALLEGED THAT IRAQI STUDENTS WILL BE DEPRIVED FROM LEARNING THEIR </p><p>LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL HISTORY. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
