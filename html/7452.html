<p>S E C R E T ABU DHABI 001826 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/NGA AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR PRM/ANE </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD AMBASSADOR LITT </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR ABRAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/13 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EFIN, PREL, ECON, PGOV, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UAE SIGNS UP FOR CORE GROUP ON IRAQ </p><p>STABILIZATION AND RECONSTRUCTION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) ABU DHABI 1667, B) STATE 80809, </p><p>      C) ABU DHABI 1508 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid told the </p><p>Ambassador 4/16 that the Cabinet had approved UAE </p><p>participation in the "core group" for Iraq </p><p>stabilization and reconstruction outlined ref b. </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan noted that the UAE -- with a modern, </p><p>diversified economy -- sees itself as a good role </p><p>model for Iraq and hopes to be able to play a </p><p>significant role in Iraq reconstruction.  To that </p><p>end, the UAEG has established, under Hamdan\'s </p><p>authority, an interagency committee (comprising the </p><p>agencies responsible for energy, transportation, </p><p>commerce, telecommunications, electricity and </p><p>agriculture) to promote UAE involvement in the </p><p>rebuilding of Iraq.  The MFA Minstate added that </p><p>the UAE hopes it will be considered a "preferred </p><p>partner" in those activities, since the Emirates </p><p>has solid expertise to offer and may carry less </p><p>political baggage with the Iraqis than other Arab </p><p>states.  Shaykh Hamdan requested more information </p><p>regarding the role of the "core group" and what </p><p>precisely will be expected of the UAEG. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Comment:  It appears the Emiratis may see </p><p>participation in the core group through the lens of </p><p>burnishing their own credentials as a "preferred </p><p>partner" for Iraq reconstruction -- with the </p><p>attendant contracts and associated business </p><p>activity it is hoped such status will bring.  We </p><p>would note that the UAE has never demanded any </p><p>explicit quid pro quo for its support for Operation </p><p>Iraqi Freedom, but there is clearly an unstated </p><p>assumption on their part that we will look </p><p>favorably upon them as contracts are awarded. </p><p>Given their sustained support for the coalition </p><p>effort, and their world-class expertise </p><p>(particularly in the telecommunications, civil </p><p>aviation, petroleum sectors and shipping), we hope </p><p>that opportunities will present themselves for the </p><p>Emiratis to play the sort of role that they desire. </p><p>Their influence on an emergent Iraqi government can </p><p>only be positive. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
