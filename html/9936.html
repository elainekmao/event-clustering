(C) Canada agrees with us that more pressure needs to be </p><p>brought to bear on the Moldovan peace process and the </p><p>withdrawal of Russian forces, and will seek opportunities to </p><p>do so.  Embassy Political Minister Counselor discussed reftel </p><p>demarche with Norbert Kalisch, Acting Assistant Deputy </p><p>Minister for Europe and the most senior official available at </p><p>Foreign Affairs.  Kalisch said that Canadian Deputy FM Peter </p><p>Harder may be visiting Moscow in October, and that he could </p><p>raise it at that time with DFM Trubnikov. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Kalisch noted that during a Trubnikov visit to Ottawa </p><p>in 2002, Canada had suggested that Moldova/Transnistria be </p><p>one of the topics for discussion with POLDIR Jim Wright, but </p><p>that Russia vetoed the suggestion.  Kalisch said that a </p><p>Harder visit would be a good opportunity to press on this </p><p>issue, and that the GoC would look for opportunities to raise </p><p>other relevant parties as well. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
