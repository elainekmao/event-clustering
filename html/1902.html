REES SAID THAT RELIGIOUS ISSUES </p><p>IN VIETNAM WERE MUCH ON THE MINDS OF MEMBERS OF </p><p>CONGRESS AS THE US AND VIETNAM CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF </p><p>FULL NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.  NOTING THAT THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE CONSITUTION PROVIDES IMPRESSIVE GUARANTEES </p><p>OF FREEDOM OF RELIGION WHILE INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS ON </p><p>USING RELIGION TO INJURE NATIONAL UNITY, HE INQUIRED </p><p>ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHOSE RELIGIOUS </p><p>PRACTICES OR HIERARCHIES WERE DIFFERENT FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-APPROVED ONES, SUCH AS WITH CERTAIN HOA HAO </p><p>FOLLOWERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.

WHEN ASKED ABOUT FOLLOWERS WHO MIGHT </p><p>DISAGREE WITH THE SELECTION OF THOSE LEADERS, MR. HIET </p><p>ASSERTED THAT VIETNAMESE CITIZENS ARE FREE TO WORSHIP </p><p>AND FOLLOW THEIR BELIEFS BUT THAT THEIR RELIGIOUS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS MUST BE LEGAL.

HIET CLAIMED THAT EVERY </p><p>COUNTRY HAS RULES GOVERNING THE SETTING UP OF </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  HE CLARIFIED THAT THROUGH A </p><p>REGISTRATION PROCESS, THE GOVERNMENT LEARNS THE </p><p>PURPOSES AND PROPOSED ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION TO </p><p>ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE ORGANIZATION IS PURELY RELIGIOUS </p><p>OR IF IT HAS POLITICAL AIMS THAT COULD BE HARMFUL TO </p><p>THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>5.

HE ASKED THAT, AS </p><p>AN ACT OF COMPASSION, THE GVN RELEASE THEM AND ALLOW </p><p>THEM TO MEET FREELY AND TO TRAVEL FOR NEEDED MEDICAL </p><p>CARE.  MR. HIET REVIEWED THEIR HISTORY, NOTING THAT </p><p>BOTH HAD BEEN CONVICTED BY A COURT IN 1977 FOR SLANDER, </p><p>NOT FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, BUT GIVEN SUSPENDED </p><p>SENTENCES.  IN 1980, THEY COMMITTED ACTS OF SLANDER </p><p>AGAIN AND WERE TRIED BUT NOT PUT IN JAIL.

REES ALSO RAISED THE CASES OF FATHER </p><p>NGUYEN VAN LY AND FIVE HOA HAO LEADERS, AND URGED THE </p><p>GVN TO RELEASE THEM AS AN ACT OF CONCILIATION, WHICH </p><p>WOULD BOTH ELIMINATE NEGATIVE INTERNATIONAL PRESS ABOUT </p><p>LACK OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN VIETNAM AND MARK AN </p><p>ENORMOUS STEP FORWARD.  REGARDING FATHER LY, MR. HIET </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE CASE WAS NOT ABOUT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>ISSUES, THAT THERE WAS NO RELIGIOUS SUPPRESSION IN </p><p>VIETNAM, AND THAT THOSE WHO VIOLATED LAWS WERE SUBJECT </p><p>TO ARREST AND COURT TRIALS.  HE SAID THE CHARGE AGAINST </p><p>FATHER LY WAS BASED ON ARTICLE 269 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE </p><p>FOR ATTACKING OR SLANDERING THE GOVERNMENT.  FATHER LY </p><p>HAD IGNORED WARNINGS NOT TO CONTINUE SUCH SLANDERS AS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02088  02 OF 02  270722Z </p><p>WELL AS LIMITATIONS ON HIS TRAVEL. </p><p> </p><p>7.

MR. HIET </p><p>RESPONDED BRIEFLY THAT THE GVN HAD NEVER FORCED ANYONE </p><p>TO GIVE UP HIS RELIGION BUT THAT IF LOCAL OFFICIALS HAD </p><p>DONE SO, THEY COULD BE PROSECUTED AND PUNISHED FOR </p><p>VIOLATING THE LAW PROBHITING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON </p><p>RELIGIOUS BELIEF. </p><p> </p><p>COMMITTEE FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES AND MOUNTAINOUS AREAS </p><p> </p><p>8.

THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HAS 12 PCT </p><p>MINORITY REPRESENTATION EVEN THOUGH ETHNIC MINORITIES </p><p>MAKE UP ONLY 11 PCT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION.  A COUNCIL </p><p>OF ETHNIC MINORITY DELEGATES ADVOCATES MINORITY </p><p>INTERESTS WITHIN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  HE POINTED TO </p><p>PROVISIONS OF THE 1992 CONSTITUTION PROHIBITING </p><p>DISCRIMINATION ON BASIS OF ETHNIC ORIGIN AND ENSURING </p><p>THE EQUALITY OF ALL 54 NATIONALITIES WITHIN VIETNAM. </p><p>HE CLAIMED THAT THE GVN HAD NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANY CASES </p><p>OF SUCH DISCRIMINATION.  HOWEVER, HE NOTED THAT ANY </p><p>ACTS THAT VIOLATE THE LAW OR CAUSE INSTABILITY WOULD BE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02088  02 OF 02  270722Z </p><p>PUNISHED.

HE CITED OTHER MEDIA </p><p>REPORTS CLAIMING THAT MONTAGNARDS FELT CHEATED AND </p><p>SPLIT WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY AFTER THEIR LIVES HAD </p><p>BECOME MORE UNSTABLE AS A RESULT OF THESE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  MR. GUNDERSON INQUIRED ABOUT THE MECHANISMS </p><p>OF THE GVN TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF </p><p>MINORITIES GUARANTEED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION.  MR.

(SBU)  MR. GUNDERSON NOTED THAT THE TREATMENT OF </p><p>MINORITIES IN VIETNAM WAS IMPORTANT TO CONGRESS AND </p><p>OTHERS IN PART BECAUSE OF THE INTEREST OF CONSTITUENTS, </p><p>AND THAT THE TREATMENT OF THESE GROUPS SHAPED VIEWS IN </p><p>THE US ABOUT VIETNAM.  MR. TO SAID THAT THE HMONG WERE </p><p>"JUST CITIZENS" WITH THE SAME RIGHTS AND </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES AS OTHER VIETNAMESE CITIZENS AND THAT </p><p>THE GVN WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MINORITY CULTURES. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02088  02 OF 02  270722Z </p><p>11.
