<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001194 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPTARTMENT PASS USTR, OPIC, EXIM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ETRD, EINV, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: RESOURCE ALLOCATION DECISION </p><p>CHANGES EXTERNAL DEBT AND CASH CALL COMPUTATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: REFERENCE: 01 ABUJA 997 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary and Introduction: The April 5 Supreme Court </p><p>judgment, which ruled that offshore resources belong to the </p><p>Federal Government not the coastal states, also removed </p><p>external debt and oil cash calls from "first line payments." </p><p>Rather than pay Nigeria,s external debt solely from national </p><p>government funds, the GON now plans to allocate the </p><p>approximately USD 30 billion debt between the national and </p><p>state governments.  Debt originally contracted by Nigeria,s </p><p>states during the 1980,s will be ascribed to their </p><p>successors.  The Debt Management Office (DMO) believes that </p><p>external payments will be delayed this month as they work out </p><p>this new national-state debt apportionment procedure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Initial reporting speculated national control of the </p><p>Federation Account would drop to less than 52 percent as a </p><p>result of the decision, as opposed to 57 percent before the </p><p>judgment.  The GON decision to charge states for part of the </p><p>external debt and states and local governments for cash call </p><p>obligations attempts to diminish this resource shift.  The </p><p>ruling is so sweeping that it will affect almost every aspect </p><p>of government.  Other areas where it will force change </p><p>include the 2002 Budget, payment of elementary school </p><p>teachers and financing of the new capital, Abuja.  End </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>The Resource Allocation Ruling </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.    The Nigerian Supreme Court announced on April 5 its </p><p>decision that the national government, and not regional </p><p>authorities (states), has sole control over offshore </p><p>resources, including oil and gas.  However, the same decision </p><p>ruled that Nigeria\'s external debt and other official </p><p>obligations such as cash calls by the joint-venture oil </p><p>companies will no longer be deducted before the money is </p><p>distributed among national, state, and local governments. </p><p>Note: Cash calls are the Nigerian Government obligation to </p><p>pay its share of joint venture capital projects in the </p><p>petroleum industry.  Joint ventures include most onshore and </p><p>shallow water production, in addition to the majority of </p><p>existing and proposed gas utilization projects: LNG\'s, </p><p>Independent Power Projects (IPP), and ChevronTexaco\'s </p><p>Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) plant.  Offshore prospects, including </p><p>Nigeria\'s deepwater blocks, are governed by Production </p><p>Sharing Contracts (PSCs), and therefore are not subject to </p><p>cash calls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Note continued: GON collectible revenues from oil and </p><p>non-oil sources, after first-line deductions, are deposited </p><p>into the Federation Account.  With the Supreme Court </p><p>decision, first-line deductions are now limited to the oil </p><p>derivation allocation (13 percent of net oil revenues), which </p><p>is set aside for development of the nine oil-producing </p><p>states, and a few other small charges.  The Federation </p><p>Account is then allocated to the national, state and local </p><p>governments according to a constitutionally mandated formula. </p><p> National government revenue is, therefore, only one portion </p><p>of the Federation Account.  For a full description of how the </p><p>Federation Account functioned prior to the ruling, see </p><p>reftel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>External Debt Traced Back to Original Source </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.    April 8, Debt Management Office Director General Akin </p><p>Arikawe told EconOff that, based on the ruling, the GON </p><p>planned to hold states responsible for payment of their </p><p>portion of Nigeria\'s external debt.  (Comment: Most </p><p>state-originated debt was accrued during the 1980s when only </p><p>19 states existed compared to today\'s 36.)  The reworking of </p><p>the external debt accounts will take place over the course of </p><p>the next month.  Nigeria\'s debt payments, he added, would be </p><p>delayed until the accounting has been completed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  The DMO will assign to Nigeria\'s new states a </p><p>proportional amount of the debt accumulated by their </p><p>predecessors using some yet undisclosed criteria.  For </p><p>example, if calculations show Zamfara is 45% of the old </p><p>Sokoto State, it will be assigned 45% of the old Sokoto State </p><p>debt.  The DMO calculations, Arikawe believed, would be </p><p>controversial.  One problem was what to do with outright </p><p>fraud.  Arikawe cited the non-existent Anambra Carpet </p><p>Factory, a company that obtained loans backed by Anambra </p><p>State which eventually were incorporated into Nigeria\'s </p><p>sovereign debt.  In this case, Arikawe indicated the GON was </p><p>considering charging the current state (Enugu) for the </p><p>malfeasance of the former Anambra Governor (current Senator </p><p>Jim Nwobodo.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Arikawe expects to have the State-based portion of the </p><p>debt ascribed by the end of this month.  This work will, </p><p>however, mean that the DMO may be late with this month\'s </p><p>external debt payments.  Once established, the states will </p><p>have their portion of the external debt withheld from their </p><p>Federation Account payment.  This is per the "right of set </p><p>off"  in the Constitution.  Nevertheless, he expects some </p><p>states, especially Imo and Abia that he claims are bankrupt, </p><p>to seek a court injunction against this action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Cash Calls To Be Shared? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. While not directly involved in the cash call issue, </p><p>Arikawe believes cash call obligations will be assessed </p><p>against the states and local government authorities.  He </p><p>assumes the GON will measure the relative impact of oil and </p><p>gas investments on each state and withhold that proportion of </p><p>funds from the state\'s Federation Account allotment.  Cash </p><p>calls and external debt present U.S. dollar exchange </p><p>problems.  Arikawe believes that keeping the books straight </p><p>will become complicated and make the rate of exchange the </p><p>source of constant bickering.  These and other issues, </p><p>including the criteria for allocating debts from "old" states </p><p>to "new" states, will be looked at by the Government\'s new </p><p>implementation committee, which met for the first time on </p><p>Tuesday, April 9, with the Attorney General at its head. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. While Arikawe felt there would be little impact on the </p><p>national or state governments from reworking external debt </p><p>payments, other aspects of the judgment, however, augur </p><p>additional funds for the states.  The country\'s revenue from </p><p>natural gas exports, capital gains tax, and stamp duties will </p><p>be subject to the same resource allocation process as oil </p><p>revenues (retroactive to May 1999).  Heretofore, they have </p><p>not been treated similarly.  All of these items will increase </p><p>revenue to the states and local governments at the expense of </p><p>the national government.  The Supreme Court decision also </p><p>struck down the one-percent first-line payment to the </p><p>Ministry of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and the </p><p>five-percent deduction for teacher salaries from the </p><p>allocation to local governments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Save for the March 28 decision declaring </p><p>unconstitutional parts of the electoral act, this is the most </p><p>far-reaching Supreme Court decision since the 1999 return to </p><p>civilian government.  It is certainly the most important </p><p>decision regarding the rights of the national and state </p><p>governments regarding resource allocation.  Where possible </p><p>its effect is retroactive and goes back to the date the </p><p>present Constitution went into force, May 29, 1999.  While it </p><p>will take some time before the full impact of the decision is </p><p>clear, it is certain that there will be many changes -- </p><p>including a new 2002 Budget ) that will need to be put into </p><p>place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  For reapportioning external debt, we believe Arikawe is </p><p>underestimating the work and time his office will need to </p><p>make the accounting changes the Administration believes </p><p>necessary.  They will then face the inevitable quarrels about </p><p>how to divide the debt among the states.  While in the </p><p>aggregate, the practical effect on external debt itself may </p><p>mainly be the change in accounting procedures (from taking </p><p>payment directly from the Federation Account to taking the </p><p>payment directly from the individual states), the process </p><p>will represent a great burden on the DMO.  Collectively the </p><p>effect on the states may be small, but some individual states </p><p>will be relative winners while others inevitably will lose. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Financing of the FCT will have to be dealt with by the </p><p>National Assembly.  Moreover, the states will probably return </p><p>to court over GON attempts to use the right of set off to </p><p>minimize the transfer of resources to the states and local </p><p>governments.  Even if they don\'t, the federal government will </p><p>still realize a large net loss from having to share tax and </p><p>natural gas revenues and fully finance the development of </p><p>Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
