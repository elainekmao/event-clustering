<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000683 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  CONDUCT OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY POLLS </p><p>RELATIVELY TRANQUIL </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons:  1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY:  This preliminary report on Nigeria\'s </p><p>April 12 National Assembly elections provides an overview </p><p>of Nigeria on election day.  More detailed observations and </p><p>analysis will be provided septel.  The elections held in a </p><p>relatively calm atmosphere.  Turnout was fair in most of </p><p>the areas directly observed by EmbOffs, with percentages </p><p>ranging from under 30 to about 60 percent.  Most polling </p><p>stations opened late, many were under-staffed.  Most INEC </p><p>staff seemed under-trained.  Domestic monitors were present </p><p>at most sites visited and the major political parties, PDP </p><p>and ANPP, had almost universal coverage of the polling </p><p>sites.  Coverage by other political party agents was good </p><p>in their respective areas of strength.  Embassy observers </p><p>noted various technical irregularities in the voting </p><p>procedure which seemed to be the result of inadequate </p><p>training and preparation by INEC.  These anomalies did not </p><p>appear to undermine the integrity of the voting process or </p><p>vote tabulation at the individual polling stations. </p><p>However, observers saw confusion and lack of organization </p><p>at numerous vote collation centers.  Overall, INEC managed </p><p>a barely adequate performance in polling places on Saturday </p><p>but most people were willing to give INEC the benefit of </p><p>the doubt.  However, the difficulties at the collation </p><p>centers are cause for concern because they could cast doubt </p><p>on the quality of the vote tabulation process and impact </p><p>expectations for Saturday\'s Presidential and Gubernatorial </p><p>polls.  INEC needs to focus on its performance in the next </p><p>round.  (Specific recommendations in Para 11.)  Too few </p><p>results are in for an assessment of the overall quality of </p><p>the legislative elections.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ATMOSPHERE </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Nigeria\'s National Assembly elections held on </p><p>April 12, in a relatively calm atmosphere through most of </p><p>the country.  There were reports of violence and </p><p>irregularities from parts of the south-south (Delta oil </p><p>region) and southeast (home of Nigeria\'s third-largest </p><p>tribe, the Igbo) and isolated incidents reported throughout </p><p>the country, but there was probably less violence on this </p><p>Saturday than on most that preceded it this year.  The </p><p>southwest (home to incumbent President Obasanjo and the </p><p>seat of the Yoruba tribe) and the north (home of the Hausa- </p><p>Fulani ethnic group) were relatively calm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TURNOUT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The turnout appeared fair throughout the areas </p><p>observed by EmbOffs.  Lagos Conoffs reported a turnout of </p><p>about 30 percent at the polling sites they visited in </p><p>Rivers State.  In Lagos, they estimated turnout at about 40 </p><p>percent.  In Katsina State (in the northwest and home to </p><p>ANPP Presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari), and Kano </p><p>state (a northern state that has either the largest or </p><p>second largest population in Nigeria), turnout was running </p><p>at about 50 percent.  Emboff reported between 40 and 50 </p><p>percent turnout at the sites visited in Edo State.  In </p><p>Kaduna State (a state with a Christian/Muslim mixed </p><p>population) and Plateau State (an ethnically-diverse state </p><p>in Nigeria\'s middle belt) some sites had a 50 to 60 percent </p><p>turnout. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INEC PERFORMANCE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Nationwide, few polling places opened at the 0800 </p><p>starting time.  In the few areas that received timely </p><p>materials, polling got underway at about 0900.  In most </p><p>areas, polling began after 1000.  Observers in Imo State </p><p>reported that INEC performed well.  In a few places </p><p>scattered around the country, polling did not begin until </p><p>early afternoon.  The cumbersome voting process prescribed </p><p>by INEC required between 3 and 5 minutes per voter to </p><p>accomplish in most stations.  (The best-run ones could </p><p>manage a voter per minute.)  In many locations, party </p><p>agents or observers filled in for the shortfall in INEC </p><p>officials.  In most of these cases, the party agents did </p><p>not act overtly partisan and contributed to the success of </p><p>the polling exercise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SITE UNSEEN </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  In two cases that Emboffs are aware of, one in the </p><p>Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and one in Katsina State, a </p><p>polling site was missing altogether.  In the FCT, DCM </p><p>encountered a group of perhaps two hundred registered </p><p>voters angry that INEC had not set up their polling </p><p>station.  Two other co-located polling stations were </p><p>operating on the same premises.  In Katsina, PolOff </p><p>discovered a site, complete with ballot boxes and a </p><p>fifteen-year-old Polling Assistant, but no materials and no </p><p>indication that any voters had registered there.  About 50 </p><p>meters away, another polling site was up and running with </p><p>20-30 people waiting their turn to vote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DOMESTIC MONITORS AND SECURITY </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Domestic monitors, including the Nigeria Labour </p><p>Council (NLC), FOMWAN (a Muslim women\'s organization), The </p><p>Monitor Group (TMG) and the Justice, Democracy and Peace </p><p>Commission (JDPC), were present at many sites.  The JDPC </p><p>was the only one seen in Benin City.  The two major </p><p>political parties (PDP and ANPP) had almost universal </p><p>coverage of the widespread polling sites, with the parties </p><p>strongest in the district generally better trained in </p><p>election day activities than many INEC officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Security was present at most polling sites; </p><p>policemen manning the polls were generally unarmed. </p><p>Prisons, Immigration and Customs officers were present </p><p>during the voting, and in some areas, soldiers had been </p><p>deployed to help prevent violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECRET BALLOTS AND VOTE TABULATION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Many polling sites made no provision for secrecy </p><p>of the ballots as voters made their choices.  The extent of </p><p>secrecy\'s compromise varied from voting in the middle of a </p><p>crowd to party agents observing individuals\' selections. </p><p>In one case, a PDP party agent was taking blank ballots </p><p>from voters and marking the ballots himself.  True secrecy </p><p>was a rarity, found in perhaps 10 to 20 percent of stations </p><p>visited. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) INEC\'s byzantine rules created some confusion at </p><p>polling sites, but normally the party agents and poll </p><p>workers were able to agree on how elections would be run. </p><p>The atmosphere of consensus and cooperation frayed at the </p><p>end of the day as results from polling stations were </p><p>collected and forwarded to collection centers and on to the </p><p>state capitals.  Unfamiliarity with the INEC forms caused </p><p>much of the confusion in collating the results, and in some </p><p>cases, zealous party agents would not allow results to be </p><p>collated in the presence of "unauthorized" persons, whether </p><p>in possession of identification or not.  Many collation </p><p>sites operated with only candles or lamplight.  Some had to </p><p>be moved because not even these forms of illumination were </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT:   INEC managed to perform adequately </p><p>(barely) on Saturday.  In spite of irregularities in the </p><p>process, most witnesses believed that the irregularities </p><p>were more technical in nature (e.g., whether the polling </p><p>officials stamped the back of the ballot paper before </p><p>issuing it) than substantive.  Party polling agents voiced </p><p>few complaints to Emboffs.  Still, INEC could have done a </p><p>much better job with a little more planning.  Distribution </p><p>and collection of the ballots was not well organized on </p><p>April 12, and its rule books were confusing.  INEC needs to </p><p>stick to schedule and revamp its transportation plan to </p><p>improve its performance by this Saturday.  While the </p><p>materials were sufficient for the National Assembly </p><p>elections, the larger turnouts expected for Presidential </p><p>and Gubernatorial elections could cause some polling sites </p><p>to run short (and raise tempers). If INEC does not resolve </p><p>some of its problems by the April 19 elections, the quality </p><p>and efficiency of the Presidential ballot could be </p><p>questioned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  RECOMMENDATIONS:  It is not too late for INEC to </p><p>succeed.  It needs at a minimum to: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  improve it delivery schedule to ensure polling stations </p><p>open on time; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  issue radio clarifications during the week and produce </p><p>a "cheat-sheet" to provide the basic guidelines for voting; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  ensure that poll agents understand the need for secrecy </p><p>in balloting; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  clarify and improve the tabulation and collation </p><p>process. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
