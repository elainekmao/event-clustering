<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS IRAQ COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:02/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, EPET, NI, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: OBASANJO ON IRAQ, TERRORISM AND OIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: President Obasanjo February 13 publicly </p><p>called  for Iraq to disarm peacefully, noting that the US </p><p>could not be expected to stand down its forces otherwise. </p><p>Recalling South Africa\'s decision to give up WMD programs, </p><p>Obasanjo repeated these points during a private meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter and DAS Bridgewater the following day. </p><p>Nigeria\'s President thought the GON could limit and contain </p><p>any violent domestic reaction to US military action in Iraq. </p><p>Oil production could rise to 2.8 MBD if necessary, Obasanjo </p><p>said.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>IRAQ MUST DISARM PEACEFULLY OR EXPECT WAR </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Responding to media reports of discovery of prohibited </p><p>Iraqi ballistic missiles, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo </p><p>February 13 told reporters Iraq must comply with UNSCR 1441 or </p><p>risk war.  Disarming nations of weapons of mass destruction </p><p>was a concern of all nations, not just the U.S.  It should not </p><p>be expected that the U.S., with over 200,000 troops in the </p><p>Gulf region, would stand down its forces without a strong </p><p>justification. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Meeting with Ambassador Jeter and AF DAS Bridgewater </p><p>at his residence February 14, Obasanjo reiterated his public </p><p>message.  He added that South Africa\'s earlier disarmament </p><p>offered Iraq a roadmap. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>THE WAR AGAINST TERROR IS "A FIGHT FOR ALL OF US" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Commenting on critics of U.S. policy, Obasanjo said he </p><p>saw the U.S. as a country that had thought itself impregnable </p><p>now forced to defend itself.  The war against terror, he went </p><p>on, is a fight for all of us.  The UNSC must, however, be the </p><p>instrument. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>GON PROBABLY CAN CONTROL DOMESTIC FUNDAMENTALISTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Taking note of Ambassador Bridgewater\'s expression of </p><p>appreciation for Nigeria\'s support for the war on terrorism, </p><p>Obasanjo remarked that Nigeria had to strike a balance among </p><p>the interests of various groups.  Of particular concern to the </p><p>GON were Christian and Muslim fundamentalists.  In response to </p><p>Ambassador Jeter\'s question, Obasanjo said the GON was working </p><p>to assess the likely internal impact of U.S. military action </p><p>in Iraq.  The point was being made repeatedly and at all </p><p>levels that the problems with Iraq were political, not </p><p>religious.  He thought that the GON could "control [its] own </p><p>fundamentalists internally."  Otherwise, "I don\'t see anything </p><p>[coming], but I cannot predict [the future]." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>OIL PRODUCTION SURGE TO 2.8 MBD POSSIBLE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Obasanjo offered that Nigeria could raise its oil </p><p>production to 2.8, possibly 2.9, MBD if the need arose.  "We </p><p>are talking to the oil companies about that," he added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The GON was caught off-guard by the violent protests </p><p>surrounding the Miss World pageant last year.  Since that </p><p>time, GON security organizations have nipped several nascent </p><p>protests in the bud, in Abuja and elsewhere.  U.S. military </p><p>action in Iraq would present a new level of challenge, and </p><p>protests, some of them probably violent, would likely take </p><p>place in several Nigerian cities.  We are pleased to note that </p><p>Obasanjo believes domestic fundamentalists can be contained. </p><p>Moreover, the GON\'s response to the most recent threats of </p><p>anti-American protests has been strong.  We do not anticipate </p><p>a strong GON response to U.S. military action.  Depending on </p><p>circumstances (e.g., what the inspectors find in coming days, </p><p>pronouncements by other governments, and, above all, civilian </p><p>casualties), we can anticipate a response ranging from tacit </p><p>support to not-very-vocal opposition.  The GON will emphasize </p><p>that the dispute with Iraq is political and not religious.  It </p><p>already is employing Muslim Ministers to deliver that point to </p><p>target audiences.  We believe this and other efforts will help </p><p>mitigate violent manifestations of disagreement with U.S. </p><p>actions.  All the same, we are examining our security posture </p><p>and considering what unilateral steps the Embassy and </p><p>Consulate General can take to enhance security.  We are also </p><p>pleased to learn of GON willingness to surge oil production in </p><p>the event of conflict.  However, we cannot at this time verify </p><p>surge capacity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Ambassador Bridgewater cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
