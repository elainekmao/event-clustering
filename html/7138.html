<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001250 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU, IZ, SY, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: (U) GOK TO TAKE ITS CASE ON THE ROAD </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 1102 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 80809 </p><p>     C. STATE 84320 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  During their April 2 meeting, the Ambassador </p><p>and MinState for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah </p><p>discussed the progress of the war and Dr. Mohammed,s </p><p>upcoming trip to key UNSC member states.  The Minister said </p><p>the focus of his visits would be to discuss an array of </p><p>issues surrounding the war in Iraq, including Kuwait\'s </p><p>disappointment with some member states for their opposition </p><p>to it.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>(U) Getting the Message Out </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) MinState for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed </p><p>al-Sabah gave the Ambassador a preview of his planned trip </p><p>during their April 2 meeting.  He said he would visit </p><p>Beijing, Moscow, Paris, London, Washington, New York (to call </p><p>on UNSYG), Berlin, Madrid and Rome in a whirlwind tour to </p><p>"explain the war from a Kuwaiti perspective" and ask </p><p>governments to condemn the Iraqi attacks against Kuwait and </p><p>support the people (vice regime) of Iraq.  In the U.S., where </p><p>he plans to arrive on April 11, he said he plans to discuss a </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq, express Kuwait,s interest in being </p><p>involved in reconstruction efforts and raise concerns the GOK </p><p>has been hearing from Iraqi opposition groups who wish to </p><p>play a greater role in the liberation of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Dr. Mohammed said Kuwait\'s Ambassador to the U.S., </p><p>Shaykh Salim al-Sabah, had put together a schedule that </p><p>includes visits to Capitol Hill, think-tanks such as The </p><p>Brookings Institution and CSIS, as well as a planned </p><p>appearance on Larry King Live (Saturday, April 12).  The </p><p>Minister said his message during these appointments and </p><p>appearances will be that Kuwait, as a country that has been </p><p>liberated from tyranny by the U.S., is very grateful for U.S. </p><p>and coalition actions to remove Saddam Hussein.  "Only people </p><p>under occupation understand this," he said. "People need to </p><p>hear that." </p><p> </p><p>(C) Article 98 </p><p>-------------- </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador took the opportunity to update Dr. </p><p>Mohammed on a number of issues he might be called upon to </p><p>discuss in Washington. Raising the ongoing effort to secure </p><p>an Article 98 agreement with Kuwait, he asked if there had </p><p>been any further progress since their March 24 meeting (ref </p><p>A).  Dr. Mohammed said that the MFA Legal Dept. had made two </p><p>"small" changes, and if they proved acceptable to the USG, he </p><p>would be willing to sign the agreement in Washington during </p><p>his visit. (Note: Post has since received the revised draft, </p><p>and forwarded it for Dept. review.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>(C) Core Group </p><p>-------------- </p><p>5. (C) Briefing Dr. Mohammed on the outlines of the Core </p><p>Group for Iraqi reconstruction (ref B), the Ambassador urged </p><p>the GOK to play an active role in Iraqi reconstruction.  He </p><p>said the USG was hoping to find a GCC partner willing to join </p><p>the Core Group and engage other regional states to assist in </p><p>the reconstruction of Iraq.   Dr. Mohammed responded by </p><p>noting that Iraq was rich in resources, and suggested that </p><p>loans and investment rather than grant aid would be the best </p><p>way to help get Iraq on its feet.  He indicated Kuwait may be </p><p>willing to assist in this effort, but made no specific </p><p>commitments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) UN/UNCC Issues </p><p>------------------ </p><p>6. (C) In the course of conversation about the need to block </p><p>efforts to raise the issue of Iraq at UN venues other than </p><p>the UNSC (ref C), Dr. Mohammed brought up what he called </p><p>"problems" Kuwait was having regarding German efforts to hold </p><p>up UNCC disbursements.  Dr. Mohammed seemed perplexed by such </p><p>efforts, and advised that France and Russia, who also support </p><p>delaying payments, wanted "to compensate their suppliers," </p><p>i.e. French and German companies.   The Ambassador reaffirmed </p><p>that the U.S. was opposed to these efforts and urged Dr. </p><p>Mohammed to contact Kuwait\'s mission in Geneva to mobilize it </p><p>against efforts to block April\'s payment of UNCC awards.  Dr. </p><p>Mohammed said he would do so without delay. </p><p> </p><p>(U) Aid Coordination </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador informed Dr. Mohammed that A/S Burns </p><p>would be calling in GCC Ambassadors in an effort to persuade </p><p>them to energize their relief efforts and coordinate them </p><p>through the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) in Kuwait. </p><p>The Ambassador raised the possibility that the GCC states </p><p>might provide personnel to help distribute humanitarian aid </p><p>in Iraq, or use Peninsula Shield forces beyond those already </p><p>here in defense of Kuwait, for this purpose.  Dr. Mohammed </p><p>said the suggestion was timely, as the GOK was currently </p><p>trying to organize a GCC investment conference, which could </p><p>be held here as early as next week.  Dr. Mohammed indicated </p><p>he would use this opportunity to raise the idea with his GCC </p><p>counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>(C) Regional States and the War </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>8.  (C) Also discussed was the progress of the war and its </p><p>immediate impact on U.S. relations with states in the region. </p><p> The Ambassador and Dr. Mohammed made a tour d\'horizon on the </p><p>roles of neighboring countries. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In response to Dr. Mohammed\'s questions, the </p><p>Ambassador confirmed that Syria continues to be unhelpful to </p><p>U.S. efforts in Iraq, both by allowing Iraq,s embassy in </p><p>Damascus to recruit fighters for Saddam, and by shipping </p><p>military items such as night vision goggles across the border </p><p>to Iraq.  Dr. Mohammed mentioned a report from his ambassador </p><p>in Syria that there had been a visible increase in "expensive </p><p>cars" with Iraqi diplomatic plates in Damascus as of late </p><p>(although most seemed to be en route to Lebanon), and that </p><p>hospitals were cordoning off sections for VIP use.  The </p><p>Ambassador confirmed for Dr. Mohammed that the air war was </p><p>being directed from PSAB, but that air strikes were not </p><p>originating from Saudi territory. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT:  As we have been reporting, the Kuwaitis </p><p>are solidly behind us, and increasingly defiant in response </p><p>to condemnation from throughout the Arab world.  In Dr. </p><p>Mohammed, the GOK is sending a very able senior spokesman to </p><p>let America, key coalition partners and key opponents of the </p><p>war know where Kuwait stands. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
