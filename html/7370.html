<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000967 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, GT, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA: ICC/ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT AND SOFA </p><p>DISCUSSIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Marisa Lino for reason 1.5 (b)(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  On the Article 98 Agreement, discussions </p><p>with the GOG covered all the points where the GOG </p><p>counterproposal differs from the US text.  New language was </p><p>proposed by both sides ad ref.  If approved, and the </p><p>negotiating team believes the proposed changes are workable, </p><p>we would have an agreement. On the SOFA text, the GOG side, </p><p>which has had the text to consider since January 2001 and has </p><p>never offered any comment on it, said it would be preferable </p><p>to have the text of the broader agreement reviewed for </p><p>constitutionality by the Constitutional Court.  Estimate is </p><p>this process might take about five months.  The US team </p><p>pressed hard to obtain detailed GOG response on the text </p><p>before that process begins, in order to see what other issues </p><p>might be raised by the GOG side.  The GOG lead negotiator </p><p>promised to provide a detailed response "very quickly."  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Article 98 Agreement Discussions </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On April 10, 2003, the PM-led interagency team met </p><p>with Guatemalan MFA officials to discuss the GOG </p><p>counterproposal to our Article 98 text. Amb. Maritza Ruiz de </p><p>Vielman (MFA Advisor and former FM) led the GOG team and was </p><p>accompanied by Amb. Regina Martinez de Palencia (Legal </p><p>Department Director), Minister Counselor Sara Solis </p><p>(Bilateral Affairs Director) and Angela Chavez (Legal Advisor </p><p>to the Treaty Department). PM Senior Advisor Marisa Lino was </p><p>accompanied by Mary Catherine Malin (L/WHA), Col. Al </p><p>Ringgenberg (DOD/GC), David Lindwall (Political Counselor) </p><p>and Robert Copley (Poloff). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Guatemalans had previously been provided with the </p><p>Article 98 text that does not specifically mention the ICC. </p><p>The discussion focused on three issues:  the new paragraphs </p><p>proposed (3 and 4 in the GOG counterproposal) and the closing </p><p>clause.  It was agreed that other minor discrepancies in the </p><p>text between the English and Spanish versions would be worked </p><p>out between the Embassy and the MFA subsequently. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Paragraph 3 of the GOG counterproposal reads as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>Quote: Both Parties undertake to investigate and, if there </p><p>are grounds for initiating a criminal complaint, to prosecute </p><p>the alleged perpetrators, based on the national jurisdiction </p><p>of each Party.  Unquote. </p><p> </p><p>The US side explained at some length the philosophy </p><p>underpinning the US position on the Rome Statute and the </p><p>concern we have for the potential for politically motivated </p><p>allegations against US persons.  The team noted that in the </p><p>case of a politically motivated case there might not be a </p><p>formal investigation initiated if a preliminary evaluation </p><p>indicated the case was politically motivated.  Thus, the </p><p>GOG-proposed language for this paragraph was unacceptable. </p><p>The GOG side noted that the importance of the paragraph was </p><p>to avoid any possibility of impunity.  Ruiz also explained </p><p>that in the Guatemalan system there is a procedure which </p><p>occurs prior to judicial review for deciding if an allegation </p><p>is politically motivated or not, based on a decision by a </p><p>designated panel of peers of the accused. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) After much discussion, both sides worked to craft a </p><p>paragraph that might take into account their respective </p><p>concerns.  Lino emphasized that any language drafted would be </p><p>strictly ad referendum and would be subject to a detailed </p><p>review in Washington.  The compromise language reads as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>Quote:  Except in cases where the Party concerned determines </p><p>that the allegations are politically motivated, each Party </p><p>shall, as appropriate, investigate and prosecute cases of war </p><p>crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, to the full </p><p>extent permitted by its domestic law.  Unquote. </p><p> </p><p>The US negotiating team believes this rewrite of the GOG </p><p>paragraph, which would appear as paragraph 3 in the operative </p><p>section of the agreement, may be an acceptable solution that </p><p>does not commit the United States beyond what our domestic </p><p>legislation can provide.  A number of countries have raised </p><p>the issue of putting similar text into the operative </p><p>paragraphs, and for the GOG it appears to be an important </p><p>issue.  Team recommends interagency consideration of this new </p><p>operative paragraph text. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Paragraph 4 of the GOG counterproposal reads as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>Quote: Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Parties </p><p>from cooperating in any investigation by an international </p><p>tribunal or from furnishing any evidence in their possession, </p><p>even if said evidence was requested as part of a proceeding </p><p>initiated against one of the persons referred to in this </p><p>Agreement.  Unquote. </p><p> </p><p>The US team took pains to explain why this language was </p><p>unacceptable, referring to the previous discussion about lack </p><p>of impunity, but also describing at length the US rationale </p><p>for not ratifying the Rome Statute.  As non-Parties, neither </p><p>side is obliged to cooperate with the ICC, but are not barred </p><p>from doing so (Guatemala is a non-signatory, non-Party, and </p><p>although the GOG has presented the Rome Statute to the </p><p>Parliament for consideration, it is not expected to pass). </p><p>The USG, however, would object to cooperation with the ICC if </p><p>allegations were to be made against a US person.  The GOG </p><p>side noted the importance politically of this issue, because, </p><p>again, the GOG needs to avoid the appearance of providing </p><p>conditions for impunity, not only for US persons but also for </p><p>Guatemalan persons.  The Embassy believes this view may be </p><p>the prevailing view in the MFA, but may not be shared within </p><p>the Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) However, the GOG team was insistent that such language </p><p>was necessary for an agreement.  After much discussion, the </p><p>US team tried to see if there might be a way to eliminate the </p><p>perception, created by the proposed language that the United </p><p>States would not object to cooperation with the ICC with </p><p>respect to a US person under ICC investigation.  The proposed </p><p>solution reads as follows: </p><p> </p><p>Quote:  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Parties </p><p>from cooperating in any investigation by an international </p><p>tribunal established by the United Nations Security Council </p><p>or from furnishing any evidence in their possession, even if </p><p>said evidence was requested as part of a proceeding initiated </p><p>against one of the persons referred to in this Agreement. </p><p>Unquote. </p><p> </p><p>By using the same formulation used to avoid mention of the </p><p>ICC, the team believes the additional phrase might make this </p><p>paragraph acceptable. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The original closing clause had inadvertently been </p><p>dropped from the text provided to the GOG.  The GOG team </p><p>insisted that both the English and Spanish texts had to be </p><p>equally authentic.  Lino noted that, in such a case, it would </p><p>be all the more important for the Embassy and the MFA to work </p><p>out the differences in the translation of the final text. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Status of Forces Agreement Discussion </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The second part of the meeting focused on the USG </p><p>proposed text (C175 approved text for WHA countries) for a </p><p>longer term status of forces agreement.  There was a pause </p><p>while Ruiz was briefed on the subject by the other members of </p><p>her team; she admitted she had not followed the issue.  The </p><p>Embassy had briefed the negotiating team that this did not </p><p>seem to be a high priority for the MFA Legal Department and </p><p>it is clear that is indeed the case.  Lino pointed out that </p><p>the enormous amount of work done by both sides to reach an </p><p>agreement for each individual exercise - agreements that </p><p>require Parliamentary approval - could be avoided by coming </p><p>to terms on a longer term SOFA.  Given the approach of NEW </p><p>HORIZONS 2004, it would be to the advantage of both sides to </p><p>reach such an agreement in time for that sizable training </p><p>exercise.  Ringgenberg added that the existence of a </p><p>longer-term SOFA permits the DOD to have much more </p><p>flexibility with respect to planning exercises and smaller </p><p>scale activities with the GOG. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Ruiz said there had been complaints about the </p><p>previous agreements signed for individual exercises and </p><p>indications that such agreements were contrary to the </p><p>constitution.  Since the proposed SOFA text is broader in </p><p>scope and longer in terms of duration, the question of </p><p>constitutionality could become even more prominent.  She </p><p>suggested strongly that it would be best to obtain an opinion </p><p>on the constitutionality of the agreement from the </p><p>Constitutional Court before proceeding to present it to the </p><p>Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  Lino pressed hard to obtain a detailed GOG response </p><p>on the text before that process begins, in order to see what </p><p>other issues might be raised by the GOG.  Ruiz said she would </p><p>have the Legal Department provide the Embassy with a detailed </p><p>response "very quickly."  She said there were probably three </p><p>main objections on constitutional grounds, although she did </p><p>not specify what those issues might be. When further pressed </p><p>by Lino, Ruiz agreed that the Legal Department would list any </p><p>other questions the GOG might have with the proposed longer </p><p>term SOFA text.  With that the session ended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) The April 10 discussions made clear the GOG\'s </p><p>political will to negotiate a compromise agreement with us </p><p>which would provide the protections we seek from the ICC. </p><p>Technical issues remain, and ultimately any agreement will </p><p>have to be sent to Guatemala\'s Congress for ratification. </p><p>The Embassy will continue to press the MFA at the highest </p><p>levels for expedited attention to our longer-term SOFA </p><p>proposal, and will report the MFA\'s comments as soon as </p><p>received.  Embassy welcomes Department\'s views of the </p><p>compromise language to the Article 98 Agreement worked out </p><p>with the MFA. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
