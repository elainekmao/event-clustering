<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RIYADH 000989 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KISL, PTER, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  BIN LADIN FAMILY PUBLICLY WASHES HANDS OF USAMA </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN A FRONT PAGE ARTICLE IN THE FEBRUARY 19 ARABIC </p><p>LANGUAGE DAILY, AL-RIYADH, BAKR BIN LADIN, HEAD OF A </p><p>LARGE AND WEALTHY JEDDAH-BASED BUSINESS FAMILY, PUBLICLY </p><p>SOUGHT TO DISTANCE HIMSELF AND HIS CLAN FROM THE FAMILY </p><p>BLACK SHEEP AND INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC ACTIVIST, HIS </p><p>BROTHER USAMA BIN LADIN.  IN THE ARTICLE, BIN LADIN </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THE FAMILY HAD NO CONTROL OVER AND NO </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OF USAMA.  A SIMILAR </p><p>ARTICLE APPEARED IN THE FEBRUARY 20 ISSUE OF THE ENGLISH </p><p>LANGUAGE DAILY, SAUDI GAZETTE.  EMBASSY PROVIDES THE </p><p>FOLLOWING TRANSLATION OF BAKR\'S STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BEGIN TRANSLATION </p><p> </p><p>ENGINEER BAKR BIN LADIN:  USAMA BIN LADIN IS RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR HIS STATEMENTS AND HIS BEHAVIOR WHICH WE NEITHER </p><p>CONTROL NOR CONDONE. </p><p> </p><p>IN LIGHT OF NEWS ITEMS RECENTLY CARRIED IN THE PRESS </p><p>CONCERNING USAMA MUHAMMAD BIN LADIN AND IN A DESIRE TO </p><p>CLARIFY THE POSITION OF HIS FAMILY, ENGINEER BAKR </p><p>MUHAMMAD BIN LADIN KABIR AL BIN LADIN ISSUED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>"I AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY--WHO NUMBER MORE </p><p>THAN FIFTY PEOPLE--EXPRESS OUR GREAT REGRET, SORROW, AND </p><p>DISAPPROVAL OF ALL OF USAMA\'S BEHAVIOR, WHICH WE NEITHER </p><p>CONTROL NOR CONDONE.  IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT USAMA </p><p>HAS BEEN LIVING OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA NOW </p><p>FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS AND ALL OF THE EFFORTS WE HAVE </p><p>MADE TO BRING HIM BACK TO THE CORRECT PATH, WE CONSIDER </p><p>HIM SINGULARLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS STATEMENTS, ACTIONS, </p><p>AND BEHAVIOR, IF IN FACT HE DID THEM. </p><p> </p><p>END TRANSLATION </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE ARE AWARE OF NO RECENT STATEMENT OR ACTION BY </p><p>USAMA THAT MIGHT HAVE TRIGGERED SUCH A REACTION.  THUS, </p><p>IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THIS DISCLAIMER WAS PROMPTED BY </p><p>THE PUBLIC ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE BIN LADEN FAMILY AS </p><p>A RESULT OF PRESS REPORTS ABOUT THE RECENT ATTACK ON </p><p>USAMA\'S RESIDENCE IN KHARTOUM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE FACT THAT BAKR\'S STATEMENT WAS CARRIED ON THE </p><p>FRONT PAGE OF A MAJOR SAUDI PAPER SUGGESTS THAT IN </p><p>ADDITION TO THE BIN LADIN FAMILY, THE ROYAL FAMILY ALSO </p><p>ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO PUBLICLY SEPARATING USAMA </p><p>FROM HIS ROOTS IN THE KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  FOR JEDDAH AND KHARTOUM:  EMBASSY RIYADH WOULD </p><p>APPRECIATE ADDITIONAL REPORTING THAT MIGHT HIGHLIGHT ANY </p><p>RECENT STATEMENTS OR ACTIONS BY USAMA--PERHAPS SINCE THE </p><p>ATTACK ON HIS RESIDENCE IN KHARTOUM--THAT MIGHT HAVE </p><p>PRECIPITATED THE PUBLIC DISAVOWAL BY BAKR AND THE FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  KHARTOUM - MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WELCH </p><p></p></div>
