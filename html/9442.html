WRIGHT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, TU, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT </p><p>WEDNESDAY, JULY 16, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THIS REPORT WILL PRESENT A TURKISH PRESS SUMMARY UNDER </p><p>THREE THEMES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MASS APPEALS </p><p>Ankara releases statement without waiting for </p><p>Washington - Milliyet </p><p>Statement voices regret, not apology - Milliyet </p><p>Boucher: Washington\'s evaluation of joint statement </p><p>continues - Sabah </p><p>U.S. not sorry enough to apologize - Vatan </p><p>Unilateral `regret\' over Suleymaniye incident - Sabah </p><p>Mere `regrets\' from U.S. - Turkiye </p><p>Crisis frozen - Aksam </p><p>Rumsfeld letter arrives instead of apology - Hurriyet </p><p>Bush in Turkey next year - Hurriyet </p><p>Denktas: Varosha might be opened to Turks - Hurriyet </p><p>North Korea admits plutonium production - Sabah </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OPINION MAKERS </p><p>Restriction on Turkey\'s activities in N. Iraq - </p><p>Cumhuriyet </p><p>U.S.-Turkey Friendship Group criticizes detentions - </p><p>Yeni Safak </p><p>Baykal on detentions: Turkey\'s pride is hurt - Yeni </p><p>Safak </p><p>Talabani denies involvement in Suleymaniye incident - </p><p>Zaman </p><p>U.S. watches KDP, PUK officials close to former Iraqi </p><p>regime - Cumhuriyet </p><p>Attacks prevent U.S. from pulling troops out of Iraq - </p><p>Radikal </p><p>Scott Ritter: Bush acted on lies, attacked Iraq - </p><p>Radikal </p><p>Syria pulls back troops from Lebanon - Yeni Safak </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Detention commission statement: In a joint military </p><p>statement on Tuesday, the U.S. and Turkey expressed </p><p>regret at "the treatment which Turkish soldiers faced </p><p>in detention."  Papers say that the statement fell far </p><p>short of the expectations of the nation and Turkey\'s </p><p>politicians.  The Americans have refused to apologize, </p><p>but managed to include in the statement U.S. concern </p><p>over Turkey\'s covert actions in the region.  "Aksam" </p><p>claims that significant problems remain between the two </p><p>allies, and that the crisis has been frozen </p><p>temporarily.  The U.S. has only `regretted\' the </p><p>mistreatment of Turkish soldiers, but not the raid </p><p>itself, "Milliyet" stresses.  The U.S. is annoyed that </p><p>TGS released the statement without waiting for </p><p>confirmation from Washington.  "Cumhuriyet" writes that </p><p>details of a regional coordination mechanism between </p><p>the two allies will be discussed during the visit of </p><p>CENTCOM Chairman General Abizaid this weekend.  The </p><p>U.S. has tried to restrict Turkey\'s influence in </p><p>Northern Iraq, but wants to make use of Turkish </p><p>resources for the reconstruction of Iraq, the paper </p><p>comments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rumsfeld letter to Erdogan: Secretary of Defense </p><p>Rumsfeld, on behalf of President Bush, sent a letter to </p><p>Prime Minister Erdogan voicing U.S. concern over the </p><p>covert actions of Turkish troops in Northern Iraq, </p><p>according to today\'s "Hurriyet." Sources regard the </p><p>letter as `very strange\' in that a letter from the </p><p>American Defense Secretary to Turkey\'s Prime Minister </p><p>is outside of accepted diplomatic practice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Bush to Turkey in 2004: "Hurriyet" says that President </p><p>Bush has officially notified Turkey of his planned </p><p>attendance at the NATO Summit meetings in Istanbul in </p><p>May 2004.  Bush made a significant goodwill gesture by </p><p>saying he could stay for three days in Turkey.  Heads </p><p>of state and government from 46 countries are expected </p><p>to attend the summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Delay possible in U.S. loans to Turkey: $8.5 billion in </p><p>U.S. loans to help Turkey weather the economic shock of </p><p>the war in Iraq could be delayed for months due to </p><p>concerns about Ankara\'s slow progress in meeting IMF </p><p>conditions, dailies report.   The U.S. loans could be </p><p>delayed until September or possibly later unless Turkey </p><p>meets its obligations under a $16 billion IMF loan </p><p>program. The U.S. loans also depend on Turkish </p><p>cooperation in Iraq, according to the press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turks may open Varosha for settlement: Papers report </p><p>that Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas has warned that the </p><p>deserted town of Varosha might be settled by Turks if </p><p>Greek Cypriots turn down his offer for joint use of </p><p>Nicosia international airport and Varosha under UN </p><p>supervision.  Papers expect Greek Cypriot President </p><p>Papadopoulos to urge UN Secretary General Annan to </p><p>respond to the Denktas offer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey to demine Syria border: Turkey\'s ministry of </p><p>defense has announced that it will provide funds to </p><p>sweep for mines along a 700-km line along the Syrian </p><p>border from Hatay to Mardin.  When demined, the 3.5 </p><p>million acres of land will be opened for agriculture. </p><p>The minefield has killed or injured over 3,000 since </p><p>being set up in 1952 for security reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq/US-Turkey Joint Statement </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Northern Iraq/Civilian and Military" </p><p>Hasan Cemal observed in mass appeal Milliyet (7/16): </p><p>"The Suleymaniye incident is inexcusable and is </p><p>incompatible with Turkish-American friendship.  Yet it </p><p>seems that both sides have understood this and </p><p>therefore toned down the rhetoric.  It is also </p><p>important that both sides see the need for greater </p><p>coordination and cooperation in the future process in </p><p>Iraq.  In spite of these efforts, bilateral relations </p><p>their current phase and for the near future present a </p><p>complex picture. . The fact of the matter is that the </p><p>US is now Turkey\'s southern neighbor.  This might </p><p>remain the case for years.  Turkey has been formulating </p><p>its Iraq policy so far based on military </p><p>considerations.  This should be changed now.  Today, </p><p>the northern Iraq issue is more of a diplomatic issue </p><p>than a military one.  Turkey should engage its foreign </p><p>ministry more than before, and form a working </p><p>coordination between civilians and the military." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Suleymaniye Report" </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (7/16): </p><p>"The joint statement contains certain messages hidden </p><p>between the lines.  . For instance, both sides clearly </p><p>admit the lack of mutual trust and confidence in </p><p>bilateral ties.  Thus Turkey and the US have declared </p><p>in the joint statement their intention to work together </p><p>toward the rebuilding of that confidence. . The US </p><p>acknowledged its mistake about the way that Turkish </p><p>military personnel were treated.  Yet the statement </p><p>also implied that the Turkish military personnel in </p><p>Northern Iraq were involved in secret activities as </p><p>claimed by the US authorities. . In sum, in this </p><p>declaration Turkey has accepted the terms of the US </p><p>policy for northern Iraq and has erased its `red </p><p>lines.\'  In return, the US has noted that it will pay </p><p>more attention to the PKK issue." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
