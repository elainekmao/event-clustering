<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002493 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/PDPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MAJOR PLACEMENT OF POWELL BYLINER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Harare is pleased to report that the November 14 </p><p>    edition of the government-controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>    carried the full text of Secretary Powell\'s byliner on Iraq </p><p>    (Washington File story AEF20012 of 11/12/2002). </p><p> </p><p>2.   The article got prominent play as the lead opinion </p><p>    piece on the op-ed page, published under the title "We do </p><p>    not seek war with Iraq - Powell."  Photographs of President </p><p>    Bush, Secretary Powell and Saddam Hussein accompanied the </p><p>    article. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Comment:  Given the current state of US-Zimbabwean </p><p>    relations, and the "Herald\'s" customary hostility to US </p><p>    policy, this placement is a significant one.  We do not </p><p>    believe it signals a change in the "Herald\'s" editorial </p><p>    policy, but are nonetheless pleased that they chose to air </p><p>    our side of the story on Iraq.  This placement also </p><p>    underscores the power of high-profile byliners.  End </p><p>    comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
