<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000353 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR IO, AF AND AF/W </p><p>NSC FOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:02/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, NI, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAQ: NIGERIAN RESPONSE TO SECRETARY POWELL\'S </p><p>FEBRURARY 14 ADDRESS TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 44467 </p><p>      ABUJA 344 </p><p>      ABUJA 300 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON: 1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The Ambassador February 16 conveyed Ref A message to </p><p>Ad\'Obe Obe, International Affairs Special Advisor to Nigerian </p><p>President Olusegun Obasanjo.  In view of Obasanjo\'s stance </p><p>(Ref B) that Iraq must disarm but that disarmament had to be </p><p>accomplished through the Security Council, the Ambassador did </p><p>not request Nigeria to speak at the Open Meeting scheduled for </p><p>February 18. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Obe did not offer a substantive responses to Ref A </p><p>points that went beyond Obasanjo\'s earlier public (para 3) and </p><p>private (Ref B) statements.  Generally, Obe echoed the points </p><p>contained in para 2 of Ref C. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) There follows the text of Obasanjo\'s public remarks. </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Question: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We have watched the drama unfolding for some weeks now.  Ex- </p><p>President Nelson Mandela has criticized the biggest democracy </p><p>in the world with what can be described as militant foreign </p><p>policy.  What is the position of Nigeria with regard to the </p><p>present behavior of the US government and Britain?  You said </p><p>your government will dwell on policies that will bring global </p><p>peace, justice and equity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First, let me say this; when I was in the United Nation\'s </p><p>General Assembly in September last year, I had a meeting with </p><p>the American Secretary of State, Colin Powell and one of the </p><p>issues we discussed was the US and Iraq.  By then, the US had </p><p>not gone to the United Nation\'s Security Council.  And I don\'t </p><p>know whether it was inclined to go there.  But I made it clear </p><p>and it\'s not me alone.  Others probably did; that we will want </p><p>the US to go to the UN Security Council and that any action </p><p>that will be taken against any country for that matter, but </p><p>particularly against Iraq, must be a collective decision of </p><p>the UN Security Council.  It was after that the US went to the </p><p>UN Security Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Whatever may be the concern of the US and one may say with </p><p>some element of understanding that a country that regarded </p><p>itself as impregnable that was taken up one morning on </p><p>9/11/2001 and from the blues a country that thought that it </p><p>was defended by land, by air, by sea, was made so cheaply </p><p>attacked but if that worries the US which is understandable, </p><p>the US also should realize that it is the only superpower in </p><p>the world now and whereas it may want to do things and damn </p><p>the consequences, then it must think of the repercussions of </p><p>damning the consequences. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Well, on the other hand, the concern for non-proliferation of </p><p>weapons of mass destruction is the concern of all of us, not </p><p>just the concern of the US, so if, as it has now been the </p><p>case, the 15 members of the Security Council on behalf of all </p><p>of us who are members of the United Nations ask Iraq to </p><p>disarm, I believe that Iraq will be better advised to disarm </p><p>peacefully and totally, peacefully and totally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then the inspectors who have been given the opportunity to </p><p>look at every nook and corner must also be given time to do </p><p>their job.  I even say that, well, we still have probably what </p><p>I can call "quarter to".  Now, within that short space of </p><p>quarter to, the world can still bring sanity on both sides. </p><p>Sanity on the side of Iraq to do what it should do. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Again, I have had the opportunity to say that the Americans </p><p>now have at least 200,000 troops in the Gulf area.  If the </p><p>President of the most powerful nation in the world has done </p><p>that, now, you have to give him reason to withdraw those </p><p>troops without a loss of face, and the only reason you can </p><p>give is to be able to say, yes, what we should have achieved </p><p>by attacking or by bombing, we have achieved by the threat of </p><p>that force, therefore there is no need to launch that force </p><p>into battle or into war. </p><p>End Text. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
