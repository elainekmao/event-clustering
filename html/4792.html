Summary. IMF Senior Representative Gary Moser and World </p><p>Bank Country Director Mark Tomlinson called on Ambassador </p><p>Jeter on Sunday, December 15, at his residence to discuss the </p><p>economic and political situation in Nigeria as part of their </p><p>preparation for this week\'s Article IV Consultations on </p><p>Nigeria in Washington.  Moser believes his policy of low-key, </p><p>behind-the-scenes advice has made a positive impact, while </p><p>Tomlinson reiterated the Bank\'s frustration with the lack of </p><p>political commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform </p><p>throughout the Nigerian political class.  Both will advise </p><p>their home offices to continue a wait-and-see attitude until </p><p>after next year\'s elections.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. IMF Representative Gary Moser listed four areas of success </p><p>by the Nigerian Government: GSM auctions and </p><p>telecommunication reform which tripled the number of phone </p><p>lines in the last 18 months; privatization of state-owned </p><p>enterprises; due process review of Federal Government capital </p><p>projects; and the reintroduction of the Dutch Auction System </p><p>(DAS) which narrowed the difference between the official and </p><p>parallel exchange rates.  Moser says the Fund now enjoys </p><p>close contact and a reservoir of goodwill with key players in </p><p>the Presidency, Central Bank, and with the Federal Accountant </p><p>General\'s office.  By avoiding the public eye, the IMF has </p><p>quietly helped in the formulation of a number of recent </p><p>policies, especially the introduction of the Dutch Auction </p><p>exchange mechanism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. World Bank Country Director Mark Tomlinson will echo Moser </p><p>in advising his home office to keep a low profile until after </p><p>the elections.  The Bank\'s official relationship with Nigeria </p><p>deteriorated in 2002 when assistance was set at the low mark </p><p>(approximately $200 million) though that decision was not </p><p>nearly as public as the GON\'s April announcement of a </p><p>suspension of its program with the IMF.  Whereas the decision </p><p>on the IMF was mutually agreed (despite the politically </p><p>opportunistic public announcement), the GON claims to have </p><p>been taken aback by the reduction of its World Bank program, </p><p>particularly eliminating a $200 million agricultural project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Tomlinson believes Nigeria\'s addiction to easy oil money </p><p>revenues is the problem.  Political elites are too busy </p><p>chasing rents from the petroleum sector to address the core </p><p>problems of the economy. As a result the vast majority of </p><p>Nigerians are resigned to poverty, increasingly worse off </p><p>than the people in neighboring countries who do not enjoy the </p><p>benefit of oil wealth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Both Moser and Tomlinson think Nigeria will face the worst </p><p>economic crunch in a generation when the GON\'s wasteful and </p><p>unsustainable policies coincide with the cyclical drop in </p><p>world oil prices projected within the next few years.  The </p><p>World Bank Country Director believes that the Nigerian </p><p>economy hitting bottom within the next several years may </p><p>provide the country\'s last best hope for meaningful reform, </p><p>poverty reduction, and sustainable non-oil development.  If </p><p>this six or seven year window of opportunity for reform is </p><p>missed, Tomlinson foresees the subsequent income from natural </p><p>gas production perpetuating the status quo of waste and </p><p>corruption which enriches very few while leaving most </p><p>Nigerians in abject poverty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Central Bank is Optimistic About Near Term Policies </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. EconOff called on Ernest Ebi, Central Bank Deputy Governor </p><p>for International Operations, on November 15, who argued that </p><p>Nigeria,s homegrown economic program is working and, in most </p><p>cases reflected the goals of the now suspended IMF Stand-By </p><p>Arrangement.  Ebi confirmed that most policies  recently </p><p>implemented were designed to meet IMF benchmarks.  The </p><p>difference, he insisted, is policies are now tempered by </p><p>local considerations, without the one-size-plan-fits-all </p><p>formula used by the IMF.  Because of this, economic reform </p><p>has a better chance of succeeding.  Ebi judged the current </p><p>GON-IMF working relationship as much more positive than </p><p>2000-01 when they had a Stand by Agreement in place.  Despite </p><p>Ebi\'s esteem for Country Director Gary Moser and IMF </p><p>Washington Office Director Menachem Katz, he and other </p><p>Nigerian policymakers think formal re-engagement with the IMF </p><p>unlikely, even undesirable, until after the 2003 elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Nigeria\'s Economy: An IMF Recession or a CBN Non-Oil Boom? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the IMF are using </p><p>very different numbers to describe current economic growth. </p><p>The IMF reported in October that Nigeria\'s economy will </p><p>shrink by 0.9 percent in 2002 (an increase from an earlier </p><p>projection of negative 2.5 percent growth).  CBN Director of </p><p>Research Dr. Joseph Nnanna claimed IMF and CBN numbers are </p><p>the same on the oil sector, where there is reliable data, but </p><p>his office believes the non-oil sector is growing at the rate </p><p>of 8.8 percent as opposed to the IMF estimate of 5.3 percent. </p><p>Where the IMF sees a recession, the CBN predicts overall </p><p>economic growth of 3.4 percent, the third consecutive year of </p><p>positive GDP per capita growth.  Nnanna discussed statistics </p><p>with the IMF team in mid-October.  The IMF based its </p><p>prediction of agricultural growth (40 percent of GDP) using </p><p>credit data from the banking system.  Nnanna believes bank </p><p>lending to the agricultural sector has always been </p><p>insignificant, and that peasant farmers get over 90 percent </p><p>of their financing from the informal financial institutions, </p><p>including cooperatives.   Nnanna plans an economic survey </p><p>next year which will give a better idea of which numbers are </p><p>most accurate.  There is much more growth in the non-oil, </p><p>non-governmental and informal sectors than people believe, he </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Drop in Foreign Exchanges Reserves -- What Worry? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Both Ebi and Nnanna claim critics are wrong in raising </p><p>alarms about the recent 25 percent fall in foreign exchange </p><p>reserves.  They argue reserves of $7.7 billion, representing </p><p>almost seven months of import cover, are healthy, even when </p><p>one considers that reserves stood at U.S. $10.4 at the end of </p><p>2001.  Minister of Finance Adamu Ciroma\'s semi-annual August </p><p>economic assessment report also noted that the fall in </p><p>reserves had been expected.  Nnanna claims internal documents </p><p>from 2001 envisioned a draw down on reserves, and that the </p><p>initial runs on the Dutch Auction System were part of that </p><p>drain. Nnanna cited Forex reserve levels, the Naira exchange </p><p>rate, and the minimum wage as politically sensitive economic </p><p>indicators.  He believed that reserves have stabilized and </p><p>will remain above the target of six-month import cover. </p><p>"Nigeria is a country with an unusual dependence on imports </p><p>and very volatile foreign exchange earnings," Nnanna </p><p>observed.  "With the Dutch Auction Nigeria can control how </p><p>much of its reserves it sells and is in better shape to deal </p><p>with reserve than it has ever been." Comment:  Falling </p><p>reserves are an easy target for anti-Obasanjo politicians. </p><p>However, up till now, management of foreign exchange has not </p><p>figured as a political issue against the President.  As long </p><p>as reserves stay above the magic six-month import cover, </p><p>management of foreign reserves will not become campaign </p><p>fodder for anti-Obasanjo forces. End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Resource Allocation: Status Quo Ante </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Despite continued wrangling between the National Assembly </p><p>and Presidency over the October legislation designed to </p><p>restore off-shore oil derivation funds to States, vetoed by </p><p>the President last week, Dr. Nnanna believes the issue is not </p><p>only finished, in terms of its effect on the national and </p><p>local economies, it is almost like it never happened.  Nnanna </p><p>claims that Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta and other coastal </p><p>oil-producing States never lost their 13 percent derivation </p><p>on oil produced offshore, as some Governors claimed.  The </p><p>April 5 decision was not quickly enforced, and the federal </p><p>government passed on the 13 percent (proportion of revenue) </p><p>to the States as always, claiming it was now a loan. </p><p>Oil-producing states suffered the same 40 percent drop in </p><p>revenues that hit all States in the first part of the year </p><p>when the GON\'s income crashed because of decline in demand, </p><p>the post 9/11 oil market and Nigeria\'s loss of 20 percent of </p><p>its OPEC quota. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Nnanna says that blaming the President and the Supreme </p><p>Court decision was probably the astute political thing to do, </p><p>and in fact, may have helped get the legislation approved. </p><p>However, he does not believe the decision affected a major </p><p>change in the economic fortunes of the oil-producing states </p><p>vis-a-vis other states.  The Revenue Mobilization Allocation </p><p>and Fiscal Commission is proposing more changes, including </p><p>reserving derivation funds for local communities in the </p><p>oil-producing areas.  While politically popular in the </p><p>South-South, it is not clear who is empowered to make such </p><p>changes as there may be constitutional challenges to the </p><p>October legislation restoring the status quo ante.  And the </p><p>beat goes on as the States are again suing the Federal </p><p>Government, this time over the 7.5 percent special fund which </p><p>is used for "national priority projects" controlled by the </p><p>Federal government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>DAS Success -- Ebi Takes Credit </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Four months since the introduction of the Dutch Auction </p><p>foreign exchange system, the parallel market premium has </p><p>stabilized at just under ten percent.  More importantly, </p><p>devaluaton of the Naira (most of which took place right </p><p>before the DAS was introduced) has been slow enough to mute </p><p>most political criticism of the CBN and Obasanjo </p><p>Administration.  This is the first of the old IMF targets </p><p>that the GON met, and Ebi is quite proud of it.  He credits </p><p>the success this time (as compared to two earlier failures of </p><p>the DAS) to several factors.  First, the CBN enjoys much more </p><p>independence from the Ministry of Finance and the President </p><p>than under previous military and civilian governments. </p><p>Secondly, the foreign reserve level was not at a crisis point </p><p>when the DAS was introduced.  Forex reserves were about $500 </p><p>million, the equivalent of less than one month of imports the </p><p>last time the DAS was tried and failed.  And perhaps most </p><p>importantly, the political and economic timing was right. </p><p>Introduction came at a time when the system was not stressed, </p><p>making its implementation easy.  The public break with the </p><p>IMF was also a plus, given historical Nigerian antipathy, </p><p>this time the DAS was introduced independently of the IMF. </p><p>Before making the announcement, Ebi only informed the office </p><p>of the Presidency and the IMF.  He claims he purposely did </p><p>not inform the President because he believed this would have </p><p>been viewed as asking permission, and would have lessened the </p><p>perception of CBN independence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>The West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) and More Missed </p><p>Macroeconomic Targets </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Despite being freed (at least officially) from its IMF </p><p>obligations, Nigeria still is obligated by treaty to meet </p><p>West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) convergence targets. The </p><p>criteria for WAMZ members Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Ghana, </p><p>Liberia and the Gambia are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--- Single digit inflation stabilizing at not more than 5 </p><p>percent by end of 2002; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--- External reserves sufficient to finance 3 months of </p><p>imports; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--- Central Bank financing of budget deficit not exceeding </p><p>ten percent of previous year\'s tax revenue; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Overall budget deficit not exceeding 4 percent of GDP </p><p>(excluding grants). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Nigeria\'s inflation rate continues to remain in double </p><p>digits and while year-to-year rates have dropped to the low </p><p>teens from a high near 20 percent a year ago, the WAMZ </p><p>targets will not be met in the near future.  The budget </p><p>deficit is projected at 4.2 percent of GDP, missing the IMF </p><p>target of 3.0 percent and the more permissive WAMZ target of </p><p>4.0 percent.  Nnanna thinks the GON will have a tough time </p><p>meeting the ten percent financing limit because the 1958 </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria Act ceiling of 12.5 percent has </p><p>become the de facto minimum as well.  External reserves, </p><p>which currently stand at 6.8 months of import cover, is the </p><p>only WAMZ benchmark met. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  According to the plan, by January 2003, all five WAMZ </p><p>member countries were to have met the above convergence </p><p>criteria  and on New Year\'s Day, 2003 the new WAMZ joint </p><p>currency would be introduced.  This would be English-speaking </p><p>West Africa\'s answer to the French-speaking CFA and would </p><p>become a single ECOWAS currency by 2004.  Nnanna and others </p><p>at the CBN are working with counterparts from WAMZ countries </p><p>to prepare for the new currency even though only the Gambia </p><p>has come close to meeting convergence criteria and none of </p><p>the political groundwork has been laid to prepare the </p><p>business or larger Nigerian community for a unified currency. </p><p>Nnanna admitted that the new currency will obviously be </p><p>delayed but that when the right time comes Obasanjo, who </p><p>first proposed the common currency with former Ghanaian </p><p>President Jerry Rawlings, will provide the political muscle </p><p>necessary to implement the change. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>CBN Won\'t Enforce New Interest Rate Cap </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  Contrary to perceptions in the banking community </p><p>(reftel), the CBN will not monitor enforcement of the </p><p>voluntary interest rate cap of four percent over the Minimum </p><p>Rediscount Rate (MRR). Ebi claims the CBN is not obligated to </p><p>enforce the interest rate cap, criticizing it as </p><p>expansionary.  "Anything that would lead to greater liquidity </p><p>would be one more problem the CBN would have to mop up," Ebi </p><p>claimed.  Interest rates, he insisted, are only one factor in </p><p>a bank\'s determination of cost of lending funds. </p><p>Institutional inefficiency and high rates of default are </p><p>others, perhaps of higher importance. </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
