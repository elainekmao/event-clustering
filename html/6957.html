Are </p><p>duties/taxes paid on that amount? What happens when the updates </p><p>are sent at a later date? Are duties/taxes applied again? If so, </p><p>based on what value? How should information be presented on the </p><p>commercial invoice for the original and subsequent shipments to </p><p>avoid paying duties/taxes more than once on a single sale? </p><p> </p><p>Sales tax of 13% is applied on the sales invoice.

Are software licenses classified in harmonized system 4907? </p><p>Are import duties/taxes applied?  If yes, on what cost/price base </p><p>are they levied?

If so, would U.S. or local laws pertain? </p><p>Definition of shrink-wrapped software: shrink-wrapped software is </p><p>software that is packaged with a terms and conditions statement, </p><p>ready for installation by the purchaser. </p><p> </p><p>As Jordan is enforcing its TRIPS-consistent Intellectual property </p><p>Law, license agreements are binding to Jordanian customers. </p><p>However, software censorship is still in effect in Jordan, and </p><p>some software (FPP, and Shrink wrap) is opened and checked by the </p><p>Censorship office of the Ministry of Information. </p><p>(Source: Jordan Computer Society) </p><p> </p><p>E.
