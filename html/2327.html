<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003237 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR SONAL SHAW AND MATT TURNER; NSC FOR CATHY BYRNE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/19/2011 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PARIS CLUB BILATERALS NOT READY BY XMAS: </p><p>MAYBE BY SPRING BREAK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) STATE 210581 </p><p>     B. (B) ABUJA 2073 </p><p>     C. (C) STATE 140051 </p><p>     D. (D) ARIKAWE/SNOW LETTER OF DECEMBER 12 </p><p>        (FORWARDED BY FACSIMILE AND POUCH) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary: The Nigerian Debt Management Office (DMO) has </p><p>not concluded any of its 15 pending Paris Club bilateral </p><p>agreements.  The DMO has creatively used the comparability </p><p>clause in the 2000 Agreed Minute to play creditors against </p><p>each other in an attempt to gain grace periods, the right to </p><p>designate how payments are credited, and the lowest interest </p><p>rates.  This tactic has delayed negotiations, including those </p><p>with the USG.   Embassy Officers have suggested to DMO </p><p>Director-General Akin Arikawe and his boss, Chief Economic </p><p>Advisor Magnus Kpakol, that they conclude the bilateral pacts </p><p>as quickly as possible, though that may not happen until the </p><p>second quarter of 2002. However, the GON negotiating tack </p><p>might not be theirs to change as it seems directed by the </p><p>President.  Obasanjo\'s personal attention to the negotiations </p><p>indicates the issue is as much political as it is economic. </p><p>The numerous unusual requests made by the GON represent his </p><p>attempt to secure creditor treatment of Nigeria as a special </p><p>case.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) EconOffs met December 12 with Debt Management Office </p><p>Director-General Akin Arikawe to receive the formal response </p><p>(Ref D) to USG comments on the draft bilateral debt </p><p>rescheduling agreement (Ref A).  Econoffs also conveyed the </p><p>contents of Ref C that the USG would not support a meeting </p><p>with the Paris Club until Nigeria completed bilateral Paris </p><p>Club agreements and had an IMF program in place. Arikawe said </p><p>Nigeria wanted the Paris Club meeting to inform the creditor </p><p>countries that Nigeria would be unable to meet its $3.4 </p><p>billion debt payments for 2002 because the GON FY 2002 budget </p><p>had allocated only $1.5 billion toward those obligations. </p><p>Arikawe wanted to discuss how to apportion the money set </p><p>aside in the FY 2002 budget for Paris Club debt.  He also </p><p>noted that Nigeria could not pay any of the $290 million </p><p>Paris Club debt that accrued from August to December 31, 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The formal GON response to Ref C includes the </p><p>following highlights.  The original letter (Ref D) has been </p><p>faxed and pouched to EB/Monetary Affairs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The DMO\'s debt figures are now fully reconciled with USG </p><p>figures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON asks that Article IV, Paragraph 4 be deleted </p><p>because there is currently no post cut-off debt not included </p><p>in the Agreed Minute. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON asks that payments that fall due on a non-business </p><p>day not accrue additional interest on that day (Annex G, </p><p>Paragraph B.2). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON requests a 30-day grace period before the accrual </p><p>of additional interest, particularly because the GON tends to </p><p>use third parties to effect payments, which sometimes causes </p><p>a delay.  (Other creditors, according to Arikawe, have </p><p>granted Nigeria grace periods between 15 and 30 days.) (Annex </p><p>G, Paragraph E) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON wants to determine how payments should be applied, </p><p>i.e., whether payments would be applied first to the </p><p>principal and secondly to late fees.  (EconOffs explained </p><p>that standard accounting procedures do not allow for </p><p>application of payments to interest before principal.) (Annex </p><p>G, Paragraph B.3) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The GON wants interest computed on a 360-day year, </p><p>12/30-day month basis. (Annex G, Paragraph D.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON asserts that the debts covered by this agreement </p><p>are now governmental, not commercial, and therefore should be </p><p>immune from suit, judgement and/or execution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GON requests a redraft of Annex G, Paragraphs H (2) </p><p>and (3) to have the courts decide who pays legal expenses in </p><p>disputes under the bilateral agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Arikawe explained the delayed GON response to USG </p><p>proposals was the result of Nigeria\'s comparability clause </p><p>negotiating strategy.  The DMO is first negotiating specific </p><p>items with creditors with whom the GON feels it will receive </p><p>the most favorable terms.  The GON will then use the </p><p>comparability clause to argue for more favorable treatment in </p><p>all its other agreements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Nigeria has not completed any of the fifteen </p><p>bilateral agreements.  Arikawe hopes to complete bilateral </p><p>agreements with Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands </p><p>before December 31, 2001.  He also anticipated that the </p><p>agreement with Germany would soon be signed; the last </p><p>remaining issue centered on the interest rate, he said. </p><p>Arikawe explained that President Obasanjo had rejected the </p><p>German agreement because the interest rate was too high (5.7 </p><p>percent versus the desired 5.3-5.4 percent).  (Comment: We </p><p>understand that as of December 14, Germany has agreed to 5.3 </p><p>percent with an additional .5 percent administrative interest </p><p>charge. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: The Mission is concerned by this three-month </p><p>delay.  The DMO, instead of using the bilateral agreements as </p><p>technical stepping stones to comprehensive debt relief, </p><p>appears determined to negotiate each agreement as an end unto </p><p>itself.  After telling Arikawe that such delaying tactics </p><p>could cost Nigeria goodwill in the Paris Club, EconOff </p><p>brought the issue up with Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Magnus </p><p>Kpakol on December 14.  Kpakol promised to meet with </p><p>President Obasanjo soon to discuss how to conclude the </p><p>agreements more quickly.  Kpakol believed, however, that the </p><p>agreements would not likely be completed before March 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) President Olusegun Obasanjo\'s personal attention is </p><p>focused on this process, which means the issue has become </p><p>just as much political as it is economic.  Obasanjo\'s </p><p>estimation of Nigeria\'s and his place in the world indicate </p><p>he believes Nigeria should receive special handling and not </p><p>be treated as any other developing world debtor by Paris Club </p><p>members.  Consequently, the unorthodox requests from Arikawe </p><p>fit GON orthodoxy -- they want debt relief.  The numerous </p><p>requests, in a certain sense, represent "debt relief through </p><p>the back door."  Their aggressive negotiating positions are </p><p>not taken just to reduce payments -- they fit Obasanjo\'s </p><p>design to cajole his creditors to treat Nigeria as a special </p><p>case.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
