<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000415 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR GORDON/BEERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PREL, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION REACHES PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political/Economic Officer Willeah E. Cato for Reasons 1 </p><p>.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  After years of internal debate, amendments </p><p>to Yemen\'s 1992 gun control law have received Cabinet </p><p>approval and been referred to Parliament for final passage. </p><p>However, the absence of official comment of late may signal </p><p>their relegation to the bottom of the pile.  Prospects for </p><p>adoption of an improved law may improve after the April </p><p>elections, but action on MANPADs is likely to continue as an </p><p>entirely separate program.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  As part of the ongoing ROYG counterterrorism </p><p>initiative, the Yemeni Cabinet has approved a series of </p><p>amendments designed to enable Law 40 for the year 1992 to </p><p>regulate possession and trafficking in weapons, ammunitions, </p><p>and fireworks more effectively.  The amendments were drafted </p><p>during 2002 and their swift approval was due, in part, to </p><p>increased political concern after a 2002 ROYG report to </p><p>Parliament on terrorist operations and activities in Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  In their current form, these amendments will, among </p><p>other things, permit the expansion and duplication of </p><p>programs like the Sanaani licensing initiative.  Established </p><p>by Presidential decree in 1999, this program has notably </p><p>increased ROYG control and supervision of weapons inside and </p><p>transiting through the capital city of Sana\'a.  The </p><p>implementation of such a program in other regions of concern </p><p>would be a significant achievement for ROYG\'s </p><p>counterterrorism efforts. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Before these amendments can be written into law, </p><p>Parliament must complete a series of constitutional </p><p>procedures.  The Cabinet has assigned oversight of the </p><p>legislative process to both the Minister of Legal Affairs and </p><p>the Minister of State for Parliament and Shura Affairs. </p><p>Nevertheless, the recent absence of official comment, either </p><p>in support of or against the legislation, may signal a </p><p>political impasse. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment:  Law 40 has remained controversial </p><p>throughout the last decade.  Although successive Ministers of </p><p>Interior have complained about its weakness and expressed </p><p>frustration at their inability to implement gun control </p><p>nationwide, tribal MPs and senior officials, especially </p><p>Parlimentary Speaker Sheikh al-Ahmar, have held any revision </p><p>in limbo for years.  Sheikh al-Ahmar continues to publicly </p><p>oppose amending Law 40, alluding to the possession of weapons </p><p>as a symbol of Yemeni manhood.  Even heightened security </p><p>concerns may thus prove insufficient to ensure its passage, </p><p>especially preceding this April\'s parliamentary elections. </p><p>Prospects could imporve after the elections, particularly if </p><p>al-Ahmar is replaced with a more reform-minded Speaker.  The </p><p>ROYG views MANPADs as a particular concern, but is likely to </p><p>continue its well-established buy-back program as an </p><p>initiative separate from the gun control legislation.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
