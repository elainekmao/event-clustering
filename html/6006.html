AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan expects 348 deputies to vote in support of the </p><p>motion, while some papers expect a significant number of AKP </p><p>deputies to stand against it. Erdogan and Prime Minister Gul </p><p>will continue efforts to convince MPs.  Erdogan has told </p><p>deputies that President Bush vowed to give Turkey written </p><p>guarantees to secure Turkish support.  AKP leaders are </p><p>expected to warn deputies that without U.S. support, </p><p>Turkey\'s economy would not be able to carry the prospective </p><p>$30 billion burden the war might bring.  Papers report </p><p>President Sezer as saying during his meeting with the </p><p>Parliamentary Speaker Arinc on Wednesday that the parliament </p><p>should wait for a new UNSC decision.  Reports claim that </p><p>Sezer and Arinc prefer two separate motions for discussion </p><p>in parliament - one for deployment of foreign troops on </p><p>Turkish soil, and the other for sending Turkish troops </p><p>abroad.  Minister of Defense Gonul said Turkey should take </p><p>its place in the operation against Iraq, or face the loss of </p><p>U.S. support in seeking EU membership and a solution in </p><p>Cyprus.  The National Security Council (NSC) will convene on </p><p>Friday to discuss Iraq and Cyprus.  The government is uneasy </p><p>about TGS intentions to declare emergency rule and martial </p><p>law in the event of a war.  Ankara has agreed with the U.S. </p><p>that Kurdish groups will not be given heavy weaponry, and </p><p>that Turkish troops will set up a security belt about 20 km </p><p>deep inside northern Iraq.  The U.S. and Turkey have also </p><p>agreed that the Turkomen will be given a role in a post-war </p><p>Iraq administration.  The deal also foresees $6 billion in </p><p>grants for Turkey, and $24 billion in loans.  Papers </p><p>criticize the government for working out a `feeble\' </p><p>financial deal with the U.S.  If the decree is approved by </p><p>the parliament on Thursday, the U.S. will begin deploying </p><p>troops and equipment to Turkey on March 3.  Patriot defense </p><p>missiles have arrived in Turkey from the Netherlands, and </p><p>Turkey has withdrawn its ambassador to Baghdad.  The border </p><p>with Iraq has been closed.  (NOTE: Parliament voted on </p><p>Thursday afternoon to delay until Saturday the debate on </p><p>allowing U.S. troops on Turkish territory.  AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan had announced yesterday that the issue would be </p><p>handled by the parliament on Thursday.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Turkey on Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rejection of US troops would still drag Turkey into war" </p><p>Ertugrul Ozkok wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (2/27): </p><p>"Characterizing the pending parliamentary decision as a </p><p>choice between war and peace is a historical distortion of </p><p>the facts.  The parliament will vote on whether to allow the </p><p>stationing of American troops in Turkey, as well as sending </p><p>our troops to abroad. .  The fact of the matter is that </p><p>regardless of the Turkish parliament\'s decision, there is no </p><p>possibility of stopping the war from happening.  Thus Turkey </p><p>should ask the following question to itself: Can Turkey stay </p><p>out of the war if the parliament declines permission? . I </p><p>will be very clear on this matter: The rejection of the </p><p>permission by the Turkish parliament will only pave the way </p><p>for Turkey\'s full engagement in the war.  When Turkey tries </p><p>to stay out of it, developments in the region take place </p><p>completely out of Turkey\'s control and influence, which will </p><p>eventually force Turkey to engage in an armed conflict in </p><p>northern Iraq.  The final chance for Saddam to work for a </p><p>peaceful settlement will be available when Turkey decides to </p><p>allow the US to open a northern front.  This is the only way </p><p>to show the insane dictator that the situation is indeed </p><p>serious. . If Turkey decides to stay out of it, there will </p><p>be a very high cost for us to pay in the next 50 years." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey\'s future requires a `yes\' to the decree" </p><p>Fikret Ertan wrote in Islamic-intellectual Zaman (2/27): </p><p>"Evidently the military power that Iraq has built is not </p><p>only the responsibility of the US but also the European </p><p>countries, mainly Germany and France.  Yet that bad record </p><p>does not justify a debate on the legitimacy of an operation. </p><p>The future of Turkey is a more important and genuine issue </p><p>than the legitimacy debate, which remains a theoretical </p><p>discussion. . The fact is that Turkey\'s situation today and </p><p>in the future is directly linked with the approval of the </p><p>parliamentary decree [allowing US troops into Turkey].  The </p><p>parliamentarians should think and act with responsibility." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We are going to war" </p><p>Can Dundar argued in mass appeal Milliyet (2/27): "This is </p><p>like raping a girl, i.e. Iraq.   And the rapist, i.e. the </p><p>US, is trying to convince us about the legitimacy of its </p><p>action.  We are given assurances that it is going to be </p><p>something enjoyable.  In fact, our role is like holding the </p><p>girl\'s arms while she is being raped. . It is so sad to see </p><p>the AKP leadership working to attain permission for the </p><p>deployment of American troops.  They are acting under </p><p>threats and blackmail from Washington, and threats from </p><p>President Bush himself.  Bush clearly told Ministers Yakis </p><p>and Babacan that without Turkey\'s permission for US troops, </p><p>Turkey would suffer the consequences: the US acting together </p><p>with northern Iraqi Kurds; the termination of IMF support; </p><p>and the passage of an Armenian resolution in the Congress. </p><p>In sum, he advised the Turkish ministers to `go back home </p><p>and pass the permission from parliament.\'  We have been </p><p>living under the shadow of the very same blackmail: a </p><p>Kurdish state, Armenian resolution etc. The fact of the </p><p>matter is that the US will leave eventually, and Turkey will </p><p>have to live side by side with Kurds and Armenians.  If we </p><p>manage to take this trump card from the US hands, we can </p><p>possibly overcome this dilemma.  It is possible to turn the </p><p>region into a center of attraction where everybody -Turks, </p><p>Kurds, Armenians and Arabs- live together in harmony and </p><p>brotherhood.  This is the only way not to bow to the </p><p>aggression for the sake of pennies." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
