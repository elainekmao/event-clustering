<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002949 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT:  PROSECUTOR IN BERLUSCONI TRIAL CALLS LAW </p><p>SUSPENDING CASES UNCONSTITUTIONAL </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) ROME 2799  B) ROME 2529 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  Prime Minister Berlusconi\'s judicial </p><p>bribery case is on hold for the immediate future.  As </p><p>expected, the prosecuting magistrates in the case used a </p><p>scheduled June 25 hearing to charge that the law suspending </p><p>the trial is unconstitutional.  The court will decide on </p><p>June 30 whether to accept prosecution arguments and seek a </p><p>review by the Constitutional Court.  Whether it does or </p><p>does not seek the review, the case will be suspended, </p><p>likely long enough to allow Parliament to pass a </p><p>constitutional amendment with similar provisions to the </p><p>current law.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Prime Minister Berlusconi did not appear at the </p><p>scheduled June 25 hearing in the "SME" judicial bribery </p><p>case against him.  His attorneys requested a suspension on </p><p>the basis of the newly-passed law precluding trials against </p><p>the five highest Italian officials while in office (refs </p><p>and previous).  President Ciampi signed the legislation, </p><p>which became effective on June 22.  The Greens and </p><p>Communist parties have begun an initiative to bring a </p><p>referendum to repeal the law, but this would be a lengthy </p><p>process.  A referendum could not be scheduled before next </p><p>spring, at the earliest. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Also as expected, Ilda Boccasini and Gherardo </p><p>Colombo, the prosecuting magistrates in the case, </p><p>criticized Berlusconi for failing to appear at the hearing </p><p>and requested a constitutional review of the law.  Colombo </p><p>argued that the law is unconstitutional because: </p><p>-- all citizens are equal before the law; high </p><p>constitutional figures should not be treated differently </p><p>where non-political crimes are concerned; </p><p> </p><p>-- trials should not be "unduly" long; </p><p> </p><p>-- magistrates are obliged under the Italian constitution </p><p>to pursue any offense brought before them (COMMENT:  Which </p><p>has the practical effect of allowing the judiciary -- not </p><p>the Justice Ministry or the government -- to set </p><p>investigative and prosecutorial priorities.  END COMMENT.); </p><p>and </p><p> </p><p>-- Italian legal principle states that the work of the </p><p>magistracy should not be impeded. </p><p> </p><p>Colombo also asserted that the law violated the European </p><p>Convention on Human Rights and should have been a </p><p>constitutional amendment, not an ordinary law. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The Milan tribunal will reconvene June 30 to </p><p>determine whether it accepts the prosecutors\' arguments. </p><p>If it were to disagree, the trial would be suspended under </p><p>the new law.  If the tribunal concurs, the law would be </p><p>sent to the Constitutional Court for review.  The </p><p>preponderance of pundits, experts, journalists, and other </p><p>observers predicts that the Constitutional Court will be in </p><p>no hurry to conclude its review.  Court members are </p><p>selected by Parliament, the President of the Republic, and </p><p>by their fellow magistrates, and thus have known political </p><p>backgrounds.  While on the Court, however, they tend to </p><p>hold themselves as part of an "institutional" entity above </p><p>the political fray.  Like President of the Republic Ciampi </p><p>(and unlike some of their fellow magistrates), </p><p>Constitutional Court judges tend to avoid overt political </p><p>activism during their tenures.  They would likely be </p><p>susceptible to Ciampi\'s public calls (not directed to the </p><p>Court) for political stability during Italy\'s EU </p><p>Presidency, at a minimum. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Ciampi, meanwhile, in an official visit to Germany </p><p>on June 26, was asked by a student at a Berlin University </p><p>conference why he countersigned the new law.  Ciampi </p><p>responded that, although he usually does not discuss </p><p>domestic politics when abroad, he would answer this </p><p>question.  The Constitutional Court is responsible for </p><p>reviewing a law\'s constitutionality, he explained, and the </p><p>President of the Republic can send a law back to Parliament </p><p>only in cases of manifest unconstitutionality.  If </p><p>Parliament were to approve the law a second time, the </p><p>President would be obliged to sign it.  Ciampi added that, </p><p>in the last twenty years, fewer than 100 laws were </p><p>overturned by the Constitutional Court. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  We are fast approaching the point when </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>the Berlusconi trial and possible outcomes will no longer </p><p>be worth reporting.  A constitutional amendment (with even </p><p>some opposition support) mirroring the just-passed law is </p><p>making its way through Parliament.  Assuming the pundits </p><p>and we are correct in predicting the Constitutional Court </p><p>will not act rapidly, an amendment would likely be far </p><p>enough along in the process to obviate questions on the </p><p>current law\'s constitutionality by the time the Court </p><p>undertakes its review.  Opponents could still organize a </p><p>referendum, but would have high obstacles (participation of </p><p>50 percent plus one of Italian voters, with a majority </p><p>voting in favor) to overturn either the just-passed law or </p><p>a future constitutional amendment. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02949 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
