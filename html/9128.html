Ozkok: The Washington Administration </p><p>has sent a letter to Chief of Staff General Ozkok, lauding </p><p>the strong leadership displayed by the top commander of </p><p>Turkey\'s military, "Milliyet" reports.  Milliyet regards the </p><p>letter as a `correction\' to the controversial remarks by </p><p>Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz, who  blamed the Turkish </p><p>military for failing to demonstrate strong leadership during </p><p>the Iraqi campaign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Government prepares new EU reform package: The AKP </p><p>government is busy drafting a 7th package of EU </p><p>harmonization laws, and has asked for advice from the </p><p>military about changes to the structure of the National </p><p>Security Council (NSC).  The government wants to change the </p><p>NSC regulation to enable the political leadership to appoint </p><p>a civilian to the post of NSC secretary general. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Survey: Civilians more liberal than officials: "Radikal" </p><p>gives details of a survey carried out by academics on 3,060 </p><p>civilians and some members of Turkey\'s judiciary in 15 </p><p>Turkish provinces.  73 percent of Turks believe that </p><p>violations of human rights are widepsread in Turkey, while </p><p>only 48 percent of the judiciary agree.  89 percent of </p><p>civilians and 73 percent of judiciary members think that </p><p>freedom of expression should not be restricted.  54 percent </p><p>of Turks and 62 percent of the judiciary are against </p><p>education in Kurdish.  74 percent of civilians and 73 </p><p>percent of judiciary members support Turkey\'s EU membership. </p><p>Radikal comments that the survey results demonstrate that </p><p>the judiciary is `lagging behind\' the Turkish public with </p><p>regard to human rights and EU issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lawmakers send `Genocide\' letter to U.S. Congress: Ruling </p><p>AKP and opposition CHP parliamentarians have sent a letter </p><p>to U.S. Congressmen expressing `deep concern\' about a </p><p>possible U.S. endorsement of Armenian `genocide\' claims, </p><p>which lack historical support, "Hurriyet" reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Problems for the U.S" </p><p>Taha Akyol opined in mass appeal Milliyet (7/2): </p><p>"Other than the Kurds, no one seems to be happy with the </p><p>Americans in Iraq.  It is obvious that an anti-American </p><p>regime will be established immediately when the US turns </p><p>over the administration to the true representatives elected </p><p>by the Iraqi people.  Was this the reason George Bush went </p><p>to war?!  The reaction of the masses increases in Iraq as </p><p>the US extends its stay in its attempt to establish </p><p>stability.  Unfortunately, the US did not fully understand </p><p>the 1,400-year tradition of Shiite opposition, and could not </p><p>foresee the reaction of the Iraqi people.  The US had </p><p>wrongly expected to be welcomed with flowers!  The US, </p><p>recalling the countless Shiite rebellions against Saddam, US </p><p>believed the Shiites would support the occupation.The fact </p><p>that the US has asked for troops from Turkey and Pakistan </p><p>for Iraq does not mean that the US will be met with flowers </p><p>by those two countries either.  Of course, our relations </p><p>with the US are highly important, and we cannot ignore Iraq. </p><p>However, Turkey should avoid the being part of a `police </p><p>force\' against Iraq, and should try to convince the US to </p><p>shape developments for Iraq\'s benefit." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Now it is understood who needs whom" </p><p>Semih Idiz comments in mass appeal Aksam (7/2): </p><p>"If Joseph Biden, the well know Democrat from Delaware, is </p><p>talking about Turkey, you can believe me that there is no </p><p>good that can come from that!  Biden is also a respected </p><p>member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee and, until </p><p>a short time ago, he never missed the chance to embrace an </p><p>anti-Turkish cause.  After visiting the region with a group </p><p>of congressmen, Biden suggested that some countries, </p><p>including Turkey, should assume greater responsibilities in </p><p>Iraq.  Moreover, he called for Turkish troops to `guard the </p><p>street corners\' in Baghdad!  Obviously, this is related to </p><p>the swamp the US is sinking into in Iraq.  Let me phrase </p><p>this differently: the US  has begun to understand that not </p><p>only France and Germany, but also Turkey, should play a role </p><p>in Iraq.What should Turkey do in this situation?  In my </p><p>opinion, the worst thing for us would be to jump into the </p><p>middle of this fire in order to make up with the US.  We </p><p>have to evaluate the issue in its real dimensions, meaning </p><p>that we should not `pick the US chestnuts out of the </p><p>fire.\'.If the US fully realizes the Iraqi reality and </p><p>decides to pass this operation to the UN, then we should </p><p>consider a serious role.  Otherwise, there is no point in </p><p>throwing our own troops into unknown dangers just to save </p><p>the Americans.  Before the war, I consistently told the </p><p>Americans: `Obviously you will win this war. That is </p><p>definite. But have you ever thought about the aftermath?!\' </p><p>Obviously, they did not." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
