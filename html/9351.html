<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 003247 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR DINT/USGS/RGARMON </p><p>FOR USAID/DCHA/OFDA/JSMITH </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OTRA, TPHY KSCA, SENV, ECON, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  USGS MISSION IN UAE IN TROUBLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 1130 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The National Drilling Company (NDC) </p><p>hasrequested that the Ground Water Research Project </p><p>(GWRP) -- the UAE entity with which the U.S. </p><p>Geological Survey (USGS) is affiliated -- stop </p><p>drilling new water wells, downsize its staff and end </p><p>its research projects in the UAE.  NDC would like the </p><p>GWRP only to maintain a database, an unacceptable </p><p>option for the USGS scientists.  For now, the two </p><p>parties have agreed to a compromise situation whereby </p><p>GWRP  reduced local staff and will curtail the </p><p>assignment of one of the three USGS scientists. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) USGS Program Advisor Douglas A. Trudeau </p><p>informed Econoff that the NDC has requested that the </p><p>GWRP stop doing research and drilling water wells and </p><p>only maintain a database.  (Note: NDC is part of </p><p>ADNOC, the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. </p><p>The GWRP program began in 1988, and USGS provides NDC </p><p>with assistance in writing guidelines and standards </p><p>for water-well drilling, well construction, well </p><p>rehabilitation and in training NDC well drillers. End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The NDC also wants GWRP to reduce costs, </p><p>downsize the workforce, and cut the American staff </p><p>down to only the country advisor.  The USGS and NDC </p><p>signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on March </p><p>10, 2003, outlining the general parameters of their </p><p>relationship (see reftel).  The two also have in place </p><p>a signed Project Implementation Plan (PIP) extension </p><p>valid until December 31, 2003, which calls for funding </p><p>3 USGS in-country advisors. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) After negotiations with NDC, the GWRP agreed </p><p>to trim the number of local staff from 51 to 23 as of </p><p>July 1, and one of the three USGS scientists will </p><p>likely curtail his assignment and leave in the next 2- </p><p>3 months.  The other two Americans will finish their </p><p>tours.  USGS maintains that it is too difficult to </p><p>have only one USGS staff person in Al Ain (the UAE </p><p>town where the project is based), but they are willing </p><p>to compromise by calling one person a country advisor </p><p>and putting two others there on long-term TDY status. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) USGS believes that solely maintaining a </p><p>database is not a worthwhile endeavor for them.  They </p><p>are trained scientists and for their mission to be </p><p>meaningful, they need to be involved in data </p><p>collection and interpretative work.  Furthermore, USGS </p><p>believes there must be provisions for drilling new </p><p>wells.  Over time the wells currently in place will </p><p>stop being functional, or given the stresses on the </p><p>ground-water system here, they will be located in </p><p>areas lacking scientific merit.  Either way, there </p><p>will be no new meaningful data. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: The USGS does not know the reasons </p><p>behind the proposed changes in the program, only that </p><p>they were requested by ADNOC.  Possible explanations </p><p>are either that ADNOC has decided to have nothing to </p><p>do with groundwater and wishes to terminate the </p><p>program, or more likely, that a new water authority </p><p>will be established in Abu Dhabi Emirate -- either </p><p>under the auspices of ADNOC or as an independent </p><p>agency.  If this is true, NDC is preparing GWRP\'s </p><p>absorption into this new entity.  The use of </p><p>groundwater is also less important in Al Ain now -- </p><p>especially for agriculture -- because a new </p><p>desalination plant in Fujairah Emirate will pump up to </p><p>150 million gallons of water per day to the region </p><p>within the next year.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
