<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 000506 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, INR, NEA/RA </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  LOCAL AND REGIONAL MEDIA COVERED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS EXTENSIVELY, UNDERSCORING HIS REMARKS </p><p>ON THE NEED FOR IRAQ TO DISARM OR BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES.  ABU </p><p>DHABI TV CARRIED THE SPEECH LIVE WITH SIMULTANEOUS ARABIC </p><p>TRANSLATION, WHILE DUBAI TV ALSO REPORTED THE SPEECH.  EDITORIALS </p><p>IN THE ARABIC PRESS WERE LARGELY CRITICAL OF THE STATE OF THE </p><p>UNION.  "AL-ITTIHAD" DID NOT BELIEVE THE U.S. HAD ALLOWED </p><p>SUFFICIENT TIME FOR EFFECTIVE DIPLOMACY.  MEANWHILE, "AL-KHALEEJ" </p><p>CLAIMED THE PRESIDENT\'S ADDRESS DIRECTLY COMPLEMENTS ISRAELI </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SHARON\'S ELECTORAL VICTORY AND WAR AGAINST </p><p>PALESTINIANS AND ARABS.  AN "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIAL ALSO VIEWED THE </p><p>SPEECH\'S NEGLECT FOR THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS AS A GREEN </p><p>LIGHT FOR SHARON TO DESTROY THE PALESTINIANS.  PROVIDING A MORE </p><p>BALANCED VIEW OF THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH, "GULF NEWS" NOTED </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH INTENDS TO CONSULT THE UN ON THE MEANS TO INCREASE </p><p>THE PRESSURE ON BAGHDAD TO COMPLY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S ADDRESS, SEMI-OFFICIAL ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/30: </p><p> </p><p>"PRESIDENT BUSH HAS LEFT THE DOOR CLOSED FOR A DIPLOMATIC </p><p>BREAKTHROUGH IN THE IRAQI CRISIS, WHICH IS ABOUT TO ENTER ITS </p><p>LATEST AND MOST DANGEROUS TURNING POINT.  HOWEVER, BUSH HAS NOT </p><p>ALLOWED ENOUGH TIME TO REACH A [DIPLOMATIC] SOLUTION FOR A </p><p>COMPLICATED ISSUE.   THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION HAS TIGHTENED </p><p>THE MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC NOOSE AROUND BAGHDAD ... THE MILITARY </p><p>PREPARATIONS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY INDICATE THAT WAR IS QUICKLY </p><p>APPROACHING UNLESS THE WORLD COMMUNITY SPEEDS UP AN EFFORT TO </p><p>AVERT IT..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "BUSH\'S SPEECH COMPLETES SHARON\'S </p><p>VICTORY," SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>ON 1/30: </p><p> </p><p>"BUSH\'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AND SHARON\'S SWEEPING VICTORY </p><p>IN THE ISRAELI ELECTIONS COME AT THE SAME TIME AND COMPLETE ONE </p><p>ANOTHER IN THE WAR AGAINST ARABS ... THE WAR AGAINST THE ARABS IS </p><p>THE IMPLICIT NAME FOR THE WAR ON TERRORISM.  THE INSPECTORS OF </p><p>THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT DID NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE AGAINST IRAQ, </p><p>SO, INSTEAD, HE TRIED TO LINK IRAQ WITH AL QAEDA ... TO KEEP IRAQ </p><p>WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS WAR AGAINST TERRORISM OR ELSE ... </p><p>BUSH\'S SPEECH AND SHARON\'S VICTORY PAVE THE WAY FOR A NEW ERA OF </p><p>WARS AND MASSACRES." </p><p> </p><p>4.  AS PART OF TWO FULL PAGES OF WORD-FOR-WORD ANALYSIS AND THE </p><p>HEADLINE "BUSH IS ADDRESSING YOU," DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED </p><p>ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/30: </p><p> </p><p>"IT SEEMS THAT THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE HAS BEEN LOST FROM BUSH\'S </p><p>CALCULATIONS.  IN HIS ANNUAL SPEECH, BUSH ONLY SPOKE ONE SENTENCE </p><p>ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST [PEACE PROCESS] ... THIS EXPLAINS THAT THE </p><p>ISSUE HAS BECOME MARGINAL TO THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION, WHICH </p><p>IS BUSY MOBILIZING THE ENTIRE WORLD FOR A WAR AGAINST IRAQ. </p><p>WASHINGTON\'S NEGLIGENCE REPRESENTS A GREEN LIGHT FOR SHARON TO DO </p><p>WHAT HE WANTS AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "BUSH THROWS GAUNTLET DOWN," DUBAI-BASED </p><p>ENGLISH DAILY "GULF NEWS" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/30: </p><p> </p><p>"BUSH\'S COMMENTS ON IRAQ WERE EAGERLY ANTICIPATED.  BUSH DID NOT </p><p>DISAPPOINT.  HE TOOK TIME TO CAREFULLY LAY OUT THE AREAS OF </p><p>DEFAULT, AS IF GIVING REASON OF AN INTENTION TO WAGE WAR AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ, RATHER THAN MAKING A DECLARATION OF WAR ... FOR BUSH HAS </p><p>EVERY INTENTION OF DEFERRING TO THE UN AS HE INTENDS ASKING FOR A </p><p>SPECIAL MEETING ON FEBRUARY 5, BY WHICH TIME IT IS ANTICIPATED </p><p>THAT HE WILL HAVE ARRIVED AT A DECISION ON WHETHER TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>WAR LATER THAT SAME MONTH ... WITH BUSH ALSO PROMISING THE </p><p>DISCLOSURE OF SECRET INTELLIGENCE AT THE MEETING, TO PROVE THE </p><p>CHARGES HE - AND BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR - HAS BEEN </p><p>MAKING, THE PRESSURE ON IRAQ IS INCREASING." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
