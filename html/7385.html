(SBU) Summary.  Honduran trade liberalization over the </p><p>past 13 years has resulted in a declining dependence on </p><p>import duties and other taxes on international trade.  In </p><p>2002, revenue from import duties had dropped to only 2.2 </p><p>percent of GDP and an estimated 12.2 percent of total tax </p><p>revenue (excluding taxes on oil products).  The gap has been </p><p>made up, primarily, by an increase in the sales tax rate. </p><p>Given that about 55 percent of Honduran imports come from </p><p>the United States, a CAFTA-related reduction in import </p><p>duties would be significant but manageable for the </p><p>government.  There has been no discussion to date on the </p><p>likely way of compensating for the revenue from CAFTA (or </p><p>eventual FTAA) tariff reductions; measures are likely to </p><p>involve elimination of remaining tax exemptions or a small </p><p>increase in the sales tax rate.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) Ref a requested reporting on the effect that a loss </p><p>of tariff revenue would have on government budgets following </p><p>the implementation of the U.S.-Central American free trade </p><p>agreement (CAFTA).  Reftels b through f provide extensive </p><p>reporting on the 2003 budget (currently under substantial </p><p>revision), the government\'s fiscal difficulties and efforts </p><p>to confront them.  In addition, a recent report by an IDB- </p><p>funded team on Honduran tax policy provides useful </p><p>historical data on the trends in customs duties receipts </p><p>over the past 13 years that can be used to project the </p><p>direct impact of tariff revenue losses, once the basic </p><p>parameters of the CAFTA agreement are agreed.  These data </p><p>are provided below. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Since the early 1990s, Honduras has transformed the </p><p>structure of its taxation of trade.  Export taxes have been </p><p>eliminated, and substituted with export promotion policies </p><p>(including the granting of extensive investment incentives </p><p>such as tax exemptions).  High tariff barriers to imports </p><p>have been progressively dismantled in conjunction with other </p><p>countries in the region and the Central American Common </p><p>Market.  As of 2002, Honduras had 5,982 eight-digit tariff </p><p>schedule line items, of which 5,169 registered some imports. </p><p>There were 13 tariff levels in the tariff schedule, with an </p><p>average nominal rate of 6.5 percent (and a trade weighted </p><p>average of 8.4 percent in 2000).  Most tariffs are now </p><p>between 0 and 15 percent.  As of 2001, 73 percent of </p><p>Honduras\'s tariff schedule was harmonized with the rest of </p><p>Central America (and further harmonization was achieved in </p><p>2002).  Tariff dispersion in 2002 was a relatively healthy </p><p>7.4 percent. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Accordingly, customs duties in Honduras have </p><p>dropped progressively since 1990 as a percentage of both GDP </p><p>and total tax revenue.  Import and export duties fell from </p><p>5.6 percent of GDP in 1990 to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2001 and </p><p>an estimated 2.2 percent of GDP in 2002.  Similarly, import </p><p>and export taxes fell from 37.5 percent of total tax revenue </p><p>in 1990 to only 15.2 percent in 2001 (and 12.2 percent of </p><p>total tax revenue if oil import taxes are excluded).  The </p><p>lowering of customs duties in Honduras in the 1990s was </p><p>accompanied by an increase in the sales tax rate to 12 </p><p>percent for most products.  As can be seen by the chart </p><p>below, by 2000, sales tax revenues had replaced import </p><p>duties as the most important source of government revenues. </p><p> </p><p>                         Table 1 </p><p>             International Trade Tax Revenues </p><p> </p><p>             1990       1995      2000      2001      2002 </p><p> </p><p>                (millions of nominal Lempira) </p><p>Total trade 707.2     1607.2    2088.2     2448.1   2437.7 </p><p>Imports     493.2     1429.5    2082.8     2448.1   2437.7 </p><p>  Oil        58.4      323.5     297.0      598.4    708.0 </p><p>  Other     434.8     1106.0    1785.8     1849.7   1729.7 </p><p>Exports     214.0      177.7       5.4        0.0      0.0 </p><p> </p><p>                      (percent of GDP) </p><p>Total Trade   5.6        4.3       2.4        2.5      2.2 </p><p>Imports       3.9        2.8       2.4        2.5      2.2 </p><p>  Oil         0.5        0.9       0.3        0.6      0.6 </p><p>  Other       3.5        2.9       2.0        1.9      1.6 </p><p>Exports       1.7        0.5       0.0        0.0      0.0 </p><p> </p><p>                  (percent of tax revenue) </p><p>Total Taxes  100.0     100.0     100.0      100.0    100.0 </p><p> Income       22.8      28.5      19.9       22.0     22.7 </p><p> Property      0.8       0.8       1.3        1.1      1.0 </p><p> Cap.Gains     0.0       0.6       0.5        0.3      0.0 </p><p> Sales        18.2      20.6      35.2       33.2     35.2 </p><p> Selective    13.4      15.1      11.2       12.0     10.9 </p><p> Services      4.8       3.8      17.6       16.2     17.6 </p><p> Trade        37.5      24.8      14.3       15.2     12.5 </p><p> Other         2.4       5.8       0.0        0.0      0.0 </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Revenue projections from the GOH\'s 2003 Central </p><p>Government budget are shown below.  These numbers are </p><p>expected to change significantly as a result of the adoption </p><p>of new tax measures on April 2 (see ref b).  The GOH hopes </p><p>that these measures will add as much as 2 billion lempiras </p><p>(usd 118 million) to the budget in 2003 and 3.5 billion </p><p>lempiras (usd 206 million) in 2004 and thereafter. </p><p> </p><p>                           Table 2 </p><p>           Central Government Revenue Projections </p><p>                         2003 Budget </p><p> </p><p>                        Millions         Pct of </p><p>                        lempira          Total </p><p>Total Revenue            32944.0          100.0 </p><p> Tax Revenue             19803.0           60.0 </p><p>   Income Tax             4315.0           13.0 </p><p>   Property Tax            212.0             .6 </p><p>   Sales and Consumption  9267.0           28.0 </p><p>   Services               3357.7           10.0 </p><p>   Import Duties          2608.0            8.0 </p><p>   Other                    44.0            0.0 </p><p> Non-Tax Revenue          1163.0            3.5 </p><p> Goods and Services         16.0            0.0 </p><p> Property Income            79.0            0.2 </p><p> Aid and Donations        1447.0            4.5 </p><p> Capital Revenues         3445.0           10.5 </p><p> Financing                6988.0           21.0 </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Approximately 55 percent of Honduran imports come </p><p>from the United States.  Thus, the reduction in import </p><p>duties on imports from the United States expected after </p><p>CAFTA would be a significant revenue reduction during this </p><p>period of high deficits; however, it would be manageable.  A </p><p>very rough estimate would indicate a revenue loss of about </p><p>usd 80 million per year if all tariffs were eliminated </p><p>immediately.  During 2002 and 2003, the government has </p><p>attempted to offset the continued reduction in customs </p><p>duties receipts with measures aimed at broadening the tax </p><p>base (reducing exemptions from income and sales tax).  There </p><p>has been no discussion to date on the likely way of </p><p>compensating for CAFTA (or eventual FTAA) tariff reductions. </p><p>It is possible that the GOH would propose an increase in the </p><p>sales tax rate. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment: The IDB consultants, in a February </p><p>briefing for Econcouns and USAID economist, also noted their </p><p>belief that in addition to the reduction in customs duty </p><p>revenue, the trade liberalization in the CAFTA agreement </p><p>will provoke additional GOH spending or tax breaks as </p><p>"compensation" to sectors negatively affected by increased </p><p>competition.  This is a possibility, as the Honduran </p><p>Congress has consistently shown its willingness to enact </p><p>special legislation for individual sectors.  However, the </p><p>current critical fiscal problems and the likelihood of </p><p>fairly strict fiscal targets in a future IMF agreement will </p><p>probably limit the GOH\'s ability to provide trade adjustment </p><p>assistance to companies or individuals.  On the plus side, </p><p>the positive impacts from a free trade agreement -- </p><p>increased investment, faster growth, and increased </p><p>efficiency -- are expected to result in increased (non- </p><p>tariff) government revenues as well.  As noted above, the </p><p>GOH also traditionally has provided significant export </p><p>promotion incentives in the form of exemptions from a range </p><p>of taxes.  To the extent that the GOH agrees in the course </p><p>of the CAFTA negotiations to reduce some of these investment </p><p>incentives, this would also have a positive effect on the </p><p>government\'s tax revenues.
