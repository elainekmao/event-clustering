RESULTS OF ANY 1988 COURT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM:  EMBASSY KNOWS OF NO/NO 1988 COURT </p><p>PROSECUTIONS IN SRI LANKA WHICH INVOLVED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM.  SEVERAL CASES WHICH WERE IN PROCESS DURING </p><p>1988, HOWEVER, INVOLVED INCIDENTS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM ARISING OUT OF THE TWO SEPARATE INSURGENCIES </p><p>WHICH SRI LANKA FACES:  IN THE NORTH THAT OF SOME </p><p>MILITANT TAMIL GROUPS--PARTICULARLY OF THE LIBERATION </p><p>TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE) WHICH CONTINUES TO OPPOSE </p><p>THE INDO-SRI LANKA PEACE ACCORD SIGNED JULY 31, </p><p>1987--AND IN THE SOUTH THAT OF THE RADICAL </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY, INTENSELY NATIONALISTIC SINHALESE </p><p>GROUP, THE JANATHA VIMUKTHI PERAMUNA (JVP). </p><p> </p><p>AMONG THEM: </p><p> </p><p>--IN THE CASE OF THE TERRORIST GRENADE ATTACK AT </p><p>PARLIAMENT ON AUGUST 18, 1987, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL </p><p>TELLS US THAT CHARGES ARE TO BE FILED "SHORTLY," </p><p>PROBABLY IN DECEMBER, AGAINST FOUR MEN.  THEY ARE </p><p>ACCUSED OF KILLING A DISTRICT MINISTER AND A </p><p>PARLIAMENT OFFICIAL AND OF TRYING TO KILL THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND THE MINISTER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY.  THE </p><p>GRENADE ATTACK ON A MEETING OF SOME 140 MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>RULING UNITED NATIONAL PARTY CAME AS PART OF PROTESTS </p><p>AGAINST THE SIGNING OF THE INDO-SRI LANKA PEACE ACCORD. </p><p> </p><p>--THE CASE HAS COME TO COURT AGAINST THREE TAMILS </p><p>ACCUSED IN THE MAY 1986 BOMBING OF AN AIR LANKA </p><p>TRI-STAP WHICH KILLED 28 PEOPLE.

THE CASE CONTINUES. </p><p> </p><p>--BEGINNING IN AUGUST 1987 FOLLOWING THE SIGNING OF </p><p>THE INDO-SRI LANKA ACCORD, AND CONTINUING THROUGHOUT </p><p>1988, SOME 4000 TAMILS SUSPECTFD MILITANTS, BEING HELD </p><p>UNDER THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT AND EMERGENCY </p><p>REGULATIONS, HAVE BEEN UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASED FROM </p><p>DETENTION. </p><p> </p><p>B.  HAS STATUS OF PLO CHANGED SINCE 1987:  THE PLO HAS </p><p>LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE GSL AND CONTINUES TO </p><p>MAINTAIN AN EMBASSY IN COLOMBO.  IT IS HEADED BY THE </p><p>EQUIVALENT OF A CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES WHO IS CALLED "PLO </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE AND HEAD OF THE MISSION" ON THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC LIST; THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER MAN, WITH </p><p>COUNSELOR RANK, ON THE DIP LIST.  SRI LANKA HAS </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE STATE OF PALESTINE WHICH WAS PROCLAIMED </p><p>AT THE PLO CONFERENCE IN ALGIERS IN MID-NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>C.  HAS SRI LANKA MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A </p><p>TERRORISM ISSUE?  NO. </p><p> </p><p>D.  A REVIEW OF MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN IN CY-88, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA:  ON DECEMBER 6, SRI LANKA ENACTED </p><p>ENABLING LEGISLATION TO CONFORM WITH THE SAARC </p><p>CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORISM; IT THUS </p><p>BECAME ONLY THE SECOND (AFTER NEPAL) OF THE SEVEN </p><p>SAARC COUNTRIES TO BRING ITS OWN STATUTES INTO LINE </p><p>WITH THE SAARC CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>E.  RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING </p><p>EXTRADITION ACTIONS, ACTIONS ON TERRORISM AFFECTING </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS AND FACILITIES, OR DEALINGS WITH </p><p>OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF TERRORISM:  NOT APPLICABLE. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT GSL WOULD BE HELPFUL AND </p><p>RESPONSIBLE TO USG CONCERNS IF TERRORISM ACTS HERE </p><p>INVOLVED AMCITS/FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>F.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT, IF ANY, FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM:  NOT APPLICABLE. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>3.  MALDIVES </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>A.  RESULTS OF ANY 1988 COURT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM:  EARLY ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER </p><p>3, A GROUP OF SOME 150 ARMED TAMIL-SPEAKING MEN (LATER </p><p>DETERMINED TO BE SRI LANKAN TAMILS, MERCENARIES WHO </p><p>WERE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF TAMIL EELAM, OR PLOTE), INVADED MALE, </p><p>THE CAPITAL ISLAND CITY OF THE MALDIVES.  TAKING THE </p><p>MALDIVIANS COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE, THEY QUICKLY GAINED </p><p>THE UPPER HAND IN MOST OF THE TINY ISLAND BUT WERE </p><p>UNABLE TO CAPTURE THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY SERVICE, THE NATION\'S COMBINED (AND </p><p>SOLE) SECURITY FORCE.  PRESIDENT GAYOOM ASKED SEVERAL </p><p>NATIONS FOR HELP IN QUELLING THE INVASION; SHORTLY </p><p>BEFORE MIDNIGHT INDIAN TROOPS ARRIVED AND WERE ABLE TO </p><p>RELIEVE THEIR BELEAGERED MALDIVIAN NSS BREATHERN. </p><p>SOME OF THE INVADERS ESCAPED BY BOAT BUT WERE LATER </p><p>CAPTURED BY INDIAN NAVY AND RETURNED TO MALE.  AT THE </p><p>END OF 1988, THE GOVERNMENT OF MALDIVES IS HOLDING </p><p>ABOUT 70 OF THESE SRI LANKAN TAMIL INVADERS, AND </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE.  THEY ALSO HOLD 2 MALDIVIAN </p><p>CITIZENS, INCLUDING THE MEN ACCUSED OF MASTERMINDING </p><p>THE PLOT, WHO WERE CAPTURED WITH THE FLEEING TAMILS. </p><p>A FURTHER TWO MALDIVIANS HAVE BEEN DETAINED FOR </p><p>QUESTIONING.  SO FAR NO TRIAL DATES HAVE BEEN SET. </p><p> </p><p>B.  HAS STATUS OF PLO CHANGED SINCE 1987:  THE PLO HAS </p><p>MAINTAINED A ONE-MAN EMBASSY IN THE MALDIVIAN CAPITAL </p><p>SINCE THE EARLY 1980\'S.  THE CURRENT PLO REPRESENTA- </p><p>TIVE, WHO HOLDS THE RANK OF AMBASSADOR, APPARENTLY IS </p><p>ONLY OCCASIONALLY IN COUNTRY.  MALDIVES HAS RECOGNIZED </p><p>THE STATE OF PALESTINE WHICH WAS PROCLAIMED IN </p><p>MID-NOVEMBER AT THE PLO\'S ALGIERS CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>C.
