<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 001153 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/ARP AND NEA/ARN </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR EB/ESC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, EAID, PREL, KU, SA, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01 - KUWAITI OIL FOR JORDAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Ambassador spoke with Kuwaiti Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaykh Mohammad Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah </p><p>afternoon of Thursday, March 27 on the status of Kuwait\'s </p><p>agreement to provide Jordan with 25,000 barrels of oil per </p><p>day (BPD) in light of the loss of Iraqi oil supplies. </p><p>Ambassador noted USG understanding that the Jordanians were </p><p>loading Saudi oil from the Ras Tanura terminal in the Persian </p><p>Gulf, and suggested the same tanker might load Kuwaiti oil </p><p>from the Neutral Zone terminal at Khafji.  (The GOK had </p><p>previously proposed a swap of Khafji oil for Saudi crude to </p><p>be loaded at the Saudi Red Sea terminal at Yanbu.) </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Dr. Mohammed said that he had spoken to Jordanian </p><p>Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher earlier, and they had indeed </p><p>already reached such an agreement.  Oil experts were now </p><p>working out the details of a loading schedule. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) The MinState expressed his surprise that the </p><p>Jordanians were lifting at Ras Tanura, given the short </p><p>distance from Yanbu to Aqaba, and Ambassador opined that </p><p>perhaps a full loading schedule at Yanbu may have precluded </p><p>quick Jordanian access to the facility.  Dr. Mohammed also </p><p>questioned the Saudi refusal to accommodate the proposed </p><p>swap, with Ambassador briefly outlining Saudi concerns about </p><p>the legal complexities of swaps and desires for simplicity </p><p>and discretion. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On March 29, local English-language daily "Arab Times" </p><p>carried an AFP report which quoted \'industry sources\' as </p><p>saying that Jordan had secured 50,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia </p><p>and 25,000 bpd from Kuwait to replace suspended Iraqi </p><p>supplies.  The sources said that Jordan was paying \'full </p><p>market prices\' for the crude. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) COMMENT: Necessity is the mother of invention. </p><p>Hopefully, this will be the last U.S. midwifery of the deal, </p><p>but we are not counting on that.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
