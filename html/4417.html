<p>UNCLAS ADANA 0388 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>NOVEMBER 8, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for </p><p>November 8, 2002.  Please note that Turkish press reports </p><p>often contain errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana </p><p>does not vouch for the accuracy of the reports summarized </p><p>here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  38 ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION MEMBERS ARRESTED IN OCTOBER </p><p>(Bolge)  According to the Mersin Security Directorate, 38 </p><p>suspected members of the illegal organization (i.e., the </p><p>PKK) were arrested during 13 operations in October in </p><p>Mersin.  The arrestees were arraigned in a local court </p><p>which ordered 19 to remain in custody.  The remaining 19 </p><p>were released but ordered to appear for their upcoming </p><p>trial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  JANDARMA ARREST 49 IRAQIS FLEEING POSSIBLE U.S. WAR </p><p>(Turkiye)  Baykan (Siirt) Jandarma arrested 49 Iraqis who </p><p>had illegally crossed into Turkey in order to flee a </p><p>possible U.S. war in Iraq.  The arrestees were taken to the </p><p>Baykan Prosecutor\'s Office following interrogation.  They </p><p>will reportedly be deported following the completion of </p><p>necessary procedures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  SIIRT MAN SOUGHT BY INTERPOL ELECTED PARLIAMENTARIAN </p><p>(Sabah)  The November 3 elections were the most interesting </p><p>of all the parliamentary elections since the foundation of </p><p>the Republic of Turkey.  For the first time, a political </p><p>party whose chairman was barred from entering the </p><p>Parliament won elections.  And for the first time, a </p><p>person, Fadil Akgunduz, sought by Interpol with a red </p><p>bulletin for fraud has been elected a parliamentarian. </p><p>What makes the November 3 elections interesting is that the </p><p>birthplace of these two victories is the same province: </p><p>Siirt.  Siirt was the province where AKP leader Recep </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan had recited a poem by Ziya Gokalp which </p><p>resulted in his conviction and a ban from active politics. </p><p>It was Siirt people who elected Akgunduz despite many cases </p><p>of fraud opened against him.  Akgunduz received 11,450 </p><p>votes, becoming the third in Siirt after the Democratic </p><p>People\'s Party (DEHAP) and AKP.  If someone has made a </p><p>mistake, the judiciary must punish him," public employee </p><p>Yusuf Alcan reacted.  Alcan claimed Akgunduz had been </p><p>prevented from establishing an automobile factory (Jet </p><p>Motor, which had earned him the name "Jet Fadil") in Siirt. </p><p>He had made investments (in Siirt) amounting to USD 100 </p><p>million and he had TL 30 trillion (18.2 million) in the </p><p>bank.  There are people who do not want any investments </p><p>made in this region, Algan argued.  Support for "Jet Fadil" </p><p>resulted from his being seen as a victim, from hope for </p><p>employment, as well as ethnic origin solidarity, and his </p><p>participation in rallies via telephone which caused Siirt </p><p>people to burst into tears.  Siirt Chamber of Commerce and </p><p>Industry President Nedim Kuzu said poverty and hopelessness </p><p>opened the way for "Jet Fadil" and gave statistics:  Income </p><p>per capita has fallen below USD 900 in Siirt, there is only </p><p>the Kurtalan (Siirt) Cement Factory, which currently </p><p>employs 250 people only.  Other plants are either </p><p>inoperative or closed. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
