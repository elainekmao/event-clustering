<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIJING 018771 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, US, CH, TW </p><p>SUBJECT:  VFM YANG JIECHI PROTESTS U.S. ACTIONS ON TAIWAN </p><p>AND TIBET </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIJING 18141 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JAMES R. SASSER.  REASON: </p><p>1.5(B) AND (D).  EXEMPTION:  1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  VFM YANG JIECHI CALLED IN THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOVEMBER 12 TO PROTEST SECRETARY RICHARDSON\'S VISIT TO </p><p>TAIWAN AND THE DALAI LAMA\'S WASHINGTON MEETINGS WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT CLINTON AND OTHER SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS.  YANG </p><p>DESCRIBED BOTH ACTIONS AS "CATEGORICALLY UNACCEPTABLE" </p><p>AND INTERFERENCE IN CHINA\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  YANG </p><p>ACCUSED THE DALAI LAMA OF USING HIS U.S. VISIT TO </p><p>DISGUISE EFFORTS AIMED AT PROMOTING TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE. </p><p>YANG WARNED AGAINST UNDERESTIMATING THE SENSITIVITY OF </p><p>THE TAIWAN AND TIBET ISSUES AND SAID IT WAS IN OUR MUTUAL </p><p>INTERESTS TO KEEP BILATERAL RELATIONS IN "GOOD SHAPE." </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  VFM YANG JIECHI CALLED IN THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOVEMBER 12 TO REGISTER PROTESTS REGARDING SECRETARY </p><p>RICHARDSON\'S VISIT TO TAIWAN AND THE DALAI LAMA\'S </p><p>WASHINGTON MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER SENIOR </p><p>U.S. OFFICIALS.  (YANG ORIGINALLY ASKED TO SEE THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ON NOVEMBER 11, BUT A MEETING COULD NOT BE </p><p>ARRANGED.  MFA, HOWEVER, WAS DETERMINED TO REGISTER ITS </p><p>PROTEST THAT DAY AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL CHEN </p><p>MINGMING DID SO THAT EVENING WITH THE ACTING DCM.) </p><p> </p><p>"SERIOUS CONCERN AND STRONG RESENTMENT" </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  YANG COMPLAINED THAT, BY SENDING SECRETARY </p><p>RICHARDSON TO TAIWAN AND ALLOWING THE DALAI LAMA TO VISIT </p><p>THE UNITED STATES, THE U.S. HAD DISREGARDED CHINA\'S </p><p>OPPOSITION AND REPRESENTATIONS (REFTEL).  YANG EXPRESSED </p><p>CHINA\'S "SERIOUS CONCERN AND STRONG RESENTMENT AT THESE </p><p>WRONG ACTIONS."  HE ADDED THAT HE HAD BEEN "INSTRUCTED TO </p><p>MAKE A PROTEST" WHICH HE HOPED THE AMBASSADOR WOULD </p><p>REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>TAIWAN:  VIOLATION OF THREE COMMUNIQUES </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ON TAIWAN, YANG RESTATED CHINA\'S OPPOSITION TO </p><p>ANY OFFICIAL CONTACT OR DEVELOPMENT OF OFFICIAL RELATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND TAIWAN, ESPECIALLY CABINET- </p><p>LEVEL VISITS.  YANG "DEMANDED" THAT THE UNITED STATES </p><p>LIMIT ITS RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN TO UNOFFICIAL TIES.  YANG </p><p>PROTESTED SECRETARY RICHARDSON\'S VISIT, HIS MEETINGS WITH </p><p>LEE TENG-HUI AND OTHER SENIOR TAIWAN OFFICIALS, AND </p><p>RICHARDSON\'S "OUTRAGEOUS REMARKS ON MANY OCCASIONS." </p><p>THIS WAS A VIOLATION OF THE THREE COMMUNIQUES AND THE </p><p>U.S. COMMITMENT NOT TO HAVE OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH </p><p>TAIWAN. </p><p> </p><p>TIBET:  SUPPORT FOR SEPARATISM </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ON TIBET, YANG DESCRIBED THE DALAI LAMA AS A </p><p>"POLITICAL EXILE ENGAGED IN SPLITTISM WHO ADVOCATED </p><p>TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE."  YANG SAID THE DALAI LAMA WAS </p><p>USING THE PROSPECT OF CONTACTS AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH </p><p>BEIJING TO CARRY OUT "PROPAGANDA" AND TO DISGUISE HIS </p><p>"DECEPTIVE TRICKS."  ACCORDING TO YANG, THE U.S. </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THE DALAI LAMA\'S VISIT AND TO </p><p>ARRANGE MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE, AMOUNTED TO "FLAGRANT CONNIVANCE AND </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE DALAI LAMA\'S SPLITTIST ACTIVITIES."  THIS </p><p>WAS A VIOLATION OF U.S. STATEMENTS THAT IT RECOGNIZED </p><p>TIBET AS PART OF CHINA AND DID NOT SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE </p><p>FOR TIBET, YANG ALLEGED. </p><p> </p><p>YANG SAYS U.S. SHOULD "CORRECT ITS MISTAKES" </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  SUMMING UP, YANG SAID THAT THE U.S. ACTIONS </p><p>CONTRAVENED INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF NON-INTERFERENCE </p><p>IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS, MUTUAL RESPECT FOR TERRITORIAL </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY, AND "HURT THE FEELINGS" OF THE </p><p>CHINESE PEOPLE.  HE VOICED "STRONG OPPOSITION" TO THE </p><p>"CATEGORICALLY UNACCEPTABLE" U.S. ACTIONS.  YANG SAID </p><p>THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT INTERFERE IN OR </p><p>ENTRENCH UPON CHINA\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  HE "DEMANDED" </p><p>THAT THE UNITED STATES ABIDE STRICTLY BY THE THREE </p><p>COMMUNIQUES AND THE BASIC PRINCIPLES GOVERNING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  YANG CLOSED BY CALLING ON THE </p><p>UNITED STATES TO "CORRECT ITS MISTAKES" AND FURTHER </p><p>IMPROVE U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS WITH CONCRETE ACTIONS. </p><p>ADDING A "PERSONAL THOUGHT," HE STRESSED THE SENSITIVITY </p><p>OF TAIWAN AND TIBET TO BEIJING AND CAUTIONED US AGAINST </p><p>MAKING "WRONG CALCULATIONS" AND NOT "REPEAT PAST </p><p>MISTAKES."  IT WAS IN OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS, YANG SAID, TO </p><p>KEEP THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP IN "GOOD SHAPE." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR ASSURED VFM YANG THAT CHINA\'S </p><p>VIEWS WOULD PROMPTLY BE REPORTED TO WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  VFM YANG TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF A SUBSEQUENT </p><p>MEETING NOVEMBER 12 WITH U/S HOLUM (SEPTEL) TO SIMILARLY </p><p>PROTEST THE DALAI LAMA AND RICHARDSON VISITS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  AS WAS THE CASE WHEN WE RECEIVED OUR LAST </p><p>PROTEST FROM YANG ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO (REFTEL), HIS </p><p>PRESENTATION TODAY WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND FREE OF </p><p>EMOTION.  THE MEETING HAD THE ADDED VIRTUE OF BREVITY, AS </p><p>YANG WENT THROUGH HIS POINTS IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES. </p><p>THIS IS NOT TO DOWNPLAY, HOWEVER, BEIJING\'S UNHAPPINESS </p><p>WITH THESE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS.  MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL CHEN MINGMING TOLD ACTING DCM NOVEMBER 11 THAT </p><p>SERIOUS CONSIDERATION HAD BEEN GIVEN TO CANCELING U/S </p><p>HOLUM\'S ON-GOING BEIJING TALKS TO DEMONSTRATE BEIJING\'S </p><p>DISPLEASURE.  ACCORDING TO CHEN, THIS OPTION WAS REJECTED </p><p>AS THE AMERICAN AFFAIRS DIVISION CONVINCINGLY ARGUED THAT </p><p>STOPPING THE TALKS WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SASSER </p><p></p></div>
