<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002800 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S OPPOSITION CHP CONTINUES TO TRY TO HAVE </p><p>IT BOTH WAYS ON RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 674 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1634 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter. </p><p>Reason: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In private conversations with us, opposition </p><p>CHP M.P.s assert they value U.S.-Turkey relations and claim </p><p>the party is the United States\' "best friend."  Publicly, </p><p>experienced CHP deputies continue to pursue an anti-American </p><p>line that belies their private assurances. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Privately "Our best friends in Turkey"... </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Reftels noted opposition CHP\'s unhelpful and often </p><p>anti-American stance with regard to U.S. Iraq policy.  In </p><p>private meetings over the last month, however, CHP M.P.s have </p><p>expressed overwhelming support for continued Turkish-U.S. </p><p>relations.  Our contacts include: CHP vice chairman Sinan </p><p>Yerlikaya; Foreign Affairs Committee member and former </p><p>ambassador to NATO Onur Oymen; Human Rights Committee member </p><p>Engin Altay; Ataturk\'s right-hand man Ismet Inonu\'s </p><p>granddaughter and Ankara deputy Gulsun Bilgehan; and pro-U.S. </p><p>Kurdish M.P. Esat Canan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As if from talking points, these deputies all offered </p><p>the following: 1) they profess to be the United States\' best </p><p>friends in Turkey; 2) they have been eager to explain away </p><p>CHP\'s anti-war policy, in part, as merely "opposition </p><p>politics;" and 3) they hearken back to the history of </p><p>U.S.-Turkey relations to suggest that these relations cannot </p><p>be spoiled by "temporary misunderstandings."  Indeed, in an </p><p>April 25 conversation, Bilgehan evoked the 1946 visit of the </p><p>battleship Missouri to Istanbul as the beginning of a strong </p><p>relationship that "will not be broken."  Rationalizing in a </p><p>bizarre way, Canan, who in previous private meetings has </p><p>lambasted CHP for its Iraq policy, told us April 29 that the </p><p>party could not support the AK government on Iraq, because AK </p><p>had followed the wrong policies in its relations with U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In an April 28 meeting with CODEL Wexler, Oymen </p><p>underscored the importance CHP places on relations with the </p><p>U.S. and agreed that Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Committee </p><p>should look into ways it can positively reinforce </p><p>Turkish-U.S. ties to the public.  Commenting on Parliament\'s </p><p>newly formed Turkish-U.S. Friendship Group, whose board in </p><p>the initial election -- now apparently voided -- was entirely </p><p>CHP, Oymen quipped, "this means CHP likes the U.S. more than </p><p>the government party." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>...But in public it\'s another story </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) What CHPers feed to the press is another story. </p><p>Mainstream press coverage of the Wexler-Oymen discussion </p><p>focused on two minor points the CHP deputy made during the </p><p>one-and-a-half hour meeting.  Oymen suggested that the U.S. </p><p>remove a "welcome to Kurdistan" sign at the Iraq border and </p><p>replace it with one reading "welcome to Iraq."  While </p><p>pointing out Turkey\'s sensitivities to U.S. pressure, Oymen </p><p>asked why former Secretary Christopher visited Syria 22 times </p><p>but never Turkey.  The media have portrayed these statements </p><p>as CHP standing up to the U.S. bully. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In a series of April articles in Turkey\'s leading </p><p>mainstream dailies, CHP deputy and foreign affairs committee </p><p>member Sukru Elekdag, who was ambassador to Washington for 10 </p><p>years, harshly criticized U.S. Iraq policy.  He called the </p><p>war "immoral, illegal, and disgusting."  Moreover, he </p><p>suggested that Turkey might re-orient its foreign policy </p><p>towards its Arab neighbors if the U.S. does not respect </p><p>Turkey\'s interests in N. Iraq.  Yerlikaya unconvincingly </p><p>dismissed Elekdag\'s statements, because the former ambassador </p><p>is not a member of the party\'s Central Administrative Board </p><p>and therefore not part of CHP leader Deniz Baykal\'s inner </p><p>circle.  "In any case, he is 80 years old.  How can we keep </p><p>quiet a man of such experience and stature?" Yerlikaya tried </p><p>to ask rhetorically.  In any event, Baykal continues to be </p><p>quoted as saying things highly critical of the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Comment: Same ol\' CHP </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) CHP\'s contradictory public and private faces reflect </p><p>the party\'s desire to have it both ways.  We continue to </p><p>emphasize to our interlocutors that this is unacceptable. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
