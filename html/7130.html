<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000638 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 04/3/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MASS, PGOV, IV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECOWAS EXEC SEC CHAMBAS SAYS REGIONAL </p><p>DEPLOYMENT NEEDS MONEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During a hurried April 3 dinner at the </p><p>Ambassador\'s residence, ECOWAS Executive Secretary Chambas </p><p>said he was accompanying President Obasanjo to Cote d\' </p><p>Ivoire for the coalition government\'s Council of State </p><p>meeting April 4. Obasanjo hopes that his attendance, along </p><p>with Presidents Kufuor, Wade and Eyadema, would convince </p><p>the rebel leaders to attend. Chambas said an ECOWAS </p><p>Ministerial would be held next week in Abidjan to discuss </p><p>ECOMICI financing which would run out this month.  He </p><p>expected that the Ministerial would task a smaller group to </p><p>visit donor countries to elicit financial support.  Chambas </p><p>also stated that ECOWAS and Nigeria were seriously </p><p>considering the use of Nigeria soldiers to provide security </p><p>for the Ivoirien Government.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) At an April 2 dinner with Ambassador Jeter, ECOWAS </p><p>Executive Secretary Mohammed Chambas said he was leaving </p><p>Abuja early the next morning to accompany President </p><p>Obasanjo to Yamoussoukro. Chambas explained that President </p><p>Obasanjo, Wade, Eyadema and Kufuor decided to go to Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire to end rebel reluctance to participate in the </p><p>National Reconciliation Government (NRG).  Rebel leaders </p><p>had boycotted prior meetings; the Heads of State feared the </p><p>rebel absence, if continued, could fatally undermine the </p><p>NRG. The regional leaders thought their presence, by </p><p>reducing the rebel\'s security concerns, would encourage the </p><p>rebels to attend the session.  When apprised that the </p><p>presidential quartet would be in Yamoussoukro, MPCI leader </p><p>Soro promised to attend.  Chambas said that Soro and other </p><p>rebels leaders had great reverence and respect for the </p><p>elder statesmen in West Africa, and especially Obasanjo. </p><p>He thought the quartet\'s effort would help. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Chambas stated he would remain in Cote d\'Ivoire to </p><p>attend an ECOWAS Ministerial next week.  He said Foreign </p><p>Ministers would meet April 7 or 8 with the priority agenda </p><p>item being ECOMICI funding. Without additional monies, </p><p>funds to sustain the deployment would dry up by the end of </p><p>April. The Ministers needed to discuss how to continue </p><p>funding the deployment. He claimed that states </p><p>participating in the force were very concerned about this </p><p>issue.  Not only did they want the deployment to be </p><p>financed for the Ivoiriens\' sake but they were also worried </p><p>about the effects in their capitals of soldiers returning </p><p>home unpaid and disgruntled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Chambas claimed that the costs for a six month </p><p>deployment of the current ECOMICI force was 26 million USD. </p><p>Compounding the financial woes, Chambas said the deployment </p><p>would last at least until 2003 elections and for a time </p><p>there after.  Ideally, ECOWAS would like to enlarge the </p><p>force to approximately 3,400 soldiers, given the force\'s </p><p>expanded mandate under the Marscoussis Accord, including </p><p>border patrol, protection of NRG members, cease-fire </p><p>monitoring and possibly disarmament and demobilization. </p><p>All in all, ECOWAS has projected an overall budget of 160 </p><p>million USD for deployment of the enlarged force until </p><p>2005. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Chambas thought the Ministers would agree to send a </p><p>small team (Ghanaian, Nigerian, Senegalese and Ivorian </p><p>Foreign Ministers) to visit G-8 and other potential donor </p><p>capitals to seek financial support.  A donor\'s conference </p><p>has also been mentioned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In response to Ambassador Jeter\'s question about </p><p>Nigerian participation in Cote d\'Ivoire, Chambas replied </p><p>that the possibility of using Nigerian troops to provide </p><p>security to the Ivorien government was under serious </p><p>consideration.  Everyone recognized that Nigeria could not </p><p>participate formally in ECOMICI due to domestic political </p><p>considerations.  However, having Nigerian troops serve </p><p>independent of ECOMICI may be more palatable, he offered. </p><p>If this deployment were accepted, it eventually could pave </p><p>the way for a slow integration of Nigerian soldiers into </p><p>the regional deployment "through the back door."  At the </p><p>very least, such a Nigerian presence would free ECOMICI </p><p>soldiers from this protective duty, allowing them to focus </p><p>on other aspects of their mandate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: Although fully cognizant of the challenges </p><p>ahead, Chambas was somewhat sanguine about chances for slow </p><p>progress on the political front in Cote d\'Ivoire.  His </p><p>greatest concern was the continued funding of the regional </p><p>deployment. Everyone agrees that more troops are needed. </p><p>However, unless ECOWAS can find more money relatively </p><p>quickly, Chambas is worried that the contingents already </p><p>there might begin to consider folding their tents, and that </p><p>would be terrible blow to the pursuit of peace in Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
