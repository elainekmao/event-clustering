<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000137 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/IL:GEORGE WHITE AND WHA/PPC:CHARLOTTE ROE </p><p>USTR FOR ANDREA DURKIN AND BUD CLATANOFF </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR FOR ILAB: ROBERT WHOLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PHUM, PGOV, ELAB, PREL, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: USING THREAT OF GSP REVIEW TO PREPARE FOR CAFTA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Pending further steps from the GOG to </p><p>protect labor rights, Embassy recommends that USTR inform the </p><p>Guatemalan Embassy in Washington (and the Department instruct </p><p>us to inform the GOG here) that the GSP petition is under </p><p>informal USG review pending an assessment of current GOG </p><p>efforts in three areas.  We believe that doing so could lead </p><p>to progress in:  bringing overdue criminal prosecutions to </p><p>court; streamlining the labor justice system; and reinstating </p><p>illegally fired workers.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On December 2, the AFL-CIO filed a petition with </p><p>USTR to withdraw GSP benefits from Guatemala due to lack of </p><p>compliance with labor rights conditions.  The International </p><p>Labor Rights Fund also submitted petitions against Guatemala </p><p>and El Salvador.  We have reviewed the AFL-CIO petition, but </p><p>not that of the ILRF. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Guatemala has been reviewed many times over past </p><p>decades, but has never lost GSP benefits.  This review would </p><p>be the first since USTR announced in May 2001 suspension of </p><p>review of Guatemala in the wake of passage of major Labor </p><p>Code reforms and sentencing of labor violators in the SITRABI </p><p>trial.  At that time and since, the USG has repeatedly </p><p>expressed concern that the revised labor code be effectively </p><p>enforced. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The standard for labor rights compliance with GSP </p><p>is broad and low (i.e. for the GOG to be "taking steps" to </p><p>afford its workers their internationally recognized labor </p><p>rights).  Thus Guatemala\'s immediate problem is less the </p><p>massive labor violations that occur every day than the </p><p>impunity that labor rights violators generally enjoy, despite </p><p>adequate protections in law.  That impunity stems from a weak </p><p>labor justice system, a weak criminal justice system, and </p><p>weak labor code enforcement measures by the Executive.  The </p><p>DYMEL case was a good example of this, until US interests </p><p>spurred us to take corrective action.  The end result was a </p><p>happy exception to the rule that even if workers win in </p><p>court, labor violators can avoid justice. </p><p> </p><p>The Petition </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The AFL-CIO petition is generally accurate </p><p>describing specific failures of the GOG to guarantee labor </p><p>rights.  It describes many notable cases in which fundamental </p><p>labor rights, including the right to organize a union, have </p><p>been flagrantly violated by employers, who often dismiss </p><p>labor organizers in violation of labor code protections. </p><p>Labor courts often rule against employers (as in the DYMEL </p><p>case), but sentences are not enforced if employers refuse to </p><p>reinstate illegally fired workers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Even more serious are a series of unsolved murders </p><p>of labor leaders (the GSP petition mentions six since January </p><p>1999; MINUGUA cites four in the period 1/1/2000-9/15/02; </p><p>another murder occurred in late November, 2002).  In response </p><p>to international criticism (from the ILO and under the GSP </p><p>process) the Public Ministry formed a new Special Prosecutor </p><p>for Crimes Against Unionists and Journalists in July 2001, to </p><p>centralize investigation of these cases.  However, the </p><p>Special Prosecutor\'s Office suffers from the usual resource </p><p>constraints and is regarded as hostile to labor concerns by </p><p>unions.  As of September 2002, the MP had issued only two </p><p>arrest warrants for 51 open cases. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The petition also describes some cases which have </p><p>since been resolved to a certain extent or been addressed by </p><p>non-government actors: </p><p> </p><p>-- Coca Cola\'s local bottler recently agreed to a collective </p><p>bargaining agreement with its union; </p><p> </p><p>-- Jalapa municipal workers struck in 2002, but returned to </p><p>work after concessions from the mayor; </p><p> </p><p>-- Choi Shin-Cimatextiles maquila has instituted regular </p><p>meetings with its unions, though nobody has been charged for </p><p>earlier violence there; </p><p> </p><p>-- ILO/IPEC has announced a new project to combat child labor </p><p>in the Guatemala City municipal dump. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Finally, the petition ignores positive GOG actions </p><p>(or "steps") on some fronts.  In 2002, these positive actions </p><p>included the creation of a consensual National Plan for </p><p>Occupational Health and Safety in 2002, cooperation with the </p><p>ILO\'s International Program to Eliminate Child Labor in </p><p>several sectors of the economy, and the revitalization of the </p><p>Labor Ministry under a new labor minister, Victor Hugo Godoy. </p><p> Godoy took office in February 2002, has had some success </p><p>reforming his ministry internally, while maintaining good </p><p>relations with AID and the Embassy, and has moderated the </p><p>antagonism between his predecessor and the private sector. </p><p>Labor Ministry fines are up, (the total is more than 10 times </p><p>the total imposed by labor courts in the past 50 years, </p><p>according to Labor Minister Godoy) though they are lower than </p><p>permitted under the new labor code. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) In 2001, we used the pressure of formal GSP review </p><p>to support legislative changes to bring the Guatemalan labor </p><p>code in compliance with its ILO commitments.  Though the </p><p>outcome was what the USG sought, it came at some political </p><p>cost.  The resulting reforms gave the Labor Minister new </p><p>enforcement powers, which have not been forcefully exercised </p><p>since employers have recourse to the courts, but which </p><p>represent a real advance in the law.  However, despite the </p><p>increase in fines cited by the minister, the situation facing </p><p>most Guatemalan workers who try to form unions is little </p><p>changed. </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Given this situation, Embassy wishes to encourage </p><p>further GOG remedial actions to protect labor rights.  We </p><p>therefore recommend that USTR inform the Guatemalan Embassy </p><p>in Washington (and the Department instruct us to inform the </p><p>GOG here) that the GSP petition is under informal review </p><p>(i.e. that a formal USTR decision will be made after the </p><p>Embassy assesses GOG progress accomplishing the elements </p><p>outlined below). </p><p> </p><p>A.  Bring overdue criminal prosecutions to court and replace </p><p>Special Prosecutor: </p><p> </p><p>We will suggest that the Attorney General replace the current </p><p>Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Unionists, given the </p><p>latter\'s poor performance.  As in other areas of law </p><p>enforcement interest, we will press for results on </p><p>outstanding criminal cases, particularly unsolved murders. </p><p>The AG will want resource support to accomplish this, and we </p><p>should consider that request when it comes.  NAS is already </p><p>planning to donate used excess computer equipment from other </p><p>Public Ministry programs. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Streamline the labor justice system: </p><p> </p><p>While the former minister introduced draft legislation to </p><p>speed labor enforcement, it has not been acted on by Congress </p><p>and is not supported by labor or employer groups.  Instead, a </p><p>labor justice committee was formed by the GOG with UNDP </p><p>support and participation by judicial system and Executive </p><p>branch members, and civil society (labor and employer </p><p>groups).  We should support this effort, and press for </p><p>concrete results (consensual administrative and legislative </p><p>changes to improve the labor justice system, including more </p><p>vigorous police enforcement of judicial sentences). </p><p> </p><p>C.  Reinstate illegally fired workers: </p><p> </p><p>The AFL-CIO GSP petition cites the Finca Maria Lourdes case </p><p>as emblematic of the problems of reinstating workers fired </p><p>for attempting to organize a union on a traditional coffee </p><p>plantation.  It also involves an affiliate of the labor </p><p>federation directly supported by the AFL-CIO.  We will urge </p><p>that the GOG effect a resolution (through reinstatement or a </p><p>financial settlement of workers claims) of this case. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
