(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) General Franks:  Your Emirati friends and </p><p>the U.S. mission to the UAE are looking forward to </p><p>your valedictory visit.  As always, UAE Armed </p><p>Forces Chief of Staff LTG Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan (MbZ) and Dubai Crown Prince GEN Shaykh </p><p>Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (MbR) relish the </p><p>opportunity to meet with you and exchange ideas, </p><p>but they are naturally disappointed that this will </p><p>be your last official visit to the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) MbZ visited the U.S. May 18-22, meeting with </p><p>the Vice President, NSA Rice, Secretary Powell, </p><p>Deputy Secretary Armitage, Secretary Rumsfeld, </p><p>Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, DCI Tenet, General </p><p>Myers, U/S Bolton, A/S Burns, A/S Bloomfield and a </p><p>host of senior senators.  The visit was very </p><p>positive and presented an opportunity for senior </p><p>U.S. policymakers and MbZ to exchange views on </p><p>Iraq, Iran, the peace process, Syria and the future </p><p>of our bilateral military relationship.  From </p><p>Washington, MbZ traveled to Texas where he met with </p><p>Lockheed Martin officials to review the status of </p><p>the F-16 Block 60 program; the first Desert Falcon </p><p>is due to roll out of the assembly plant this </p><p>October and the Emiratis are beginning preparations </p><p>for the December 2004 arrival of the first squadron </p><p>in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>SUGGESTED THEMES </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) We propose that you touch on the following </p><p>key bilateral military issues, in addition to the </p><p>more general themes outlined below in para four: </p><p> </p><p>-- Provide a "look-ahead" on our likely military </p><p>footprint both in the UAE specifically and the </p><p>region more generally (MbZ, MbR); </p><p> </p><p>-- Urge finalization of the Memorandum of Reference </p><p>between our armed forces for the deployment of a </p><p>Special Operations unit to Afghanistan (MbZ); </p><p> </p><p>-- Express our appreciation for the superb </p><p>coordination and leadership provided for the </p><p>establishment of the Air Warfare Center.  The </p><p>Center will be a model for multilateral training in </p><p>the region (MbZ); </p><p> </p><p>-- Focus the UAE military leadership on the need, </p><p>as part of our commitment to building and </p><p>solidifying our strong military ties, to reengage </p><p>seriously on the Defense Cooperation Agreement </p><p>(MbZ, MbR). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) More broadly, you may also wish to: </p><p> </p><p>-- Express thanks for the UAE\'s exemplary support </p><p>for U.S. and coalition efforts in Iraq and </p><p>Afghanistan, namely access to bases, logistical </p><p>support and intelligence coordination (MbZ, MbR); </p><p> </p><p>-- Pass on our gratitude for the UAE\'s generous </p><p>humanitarian assistance, especially the UAE Armed </p><p>Force\'s establishment of the very successful Shaykh </p><p>Zayid hospital in Baghdad and the UAE\'s efforts to </p><p>resupply with equipment and medicine other Iraqi </p><p>hospitals and the provision of basic foodstuffs to </p><p>the Iraqi people (MbZ); </p><p> </p><p>-- Consult and provide assurances on need to </p><p>maintain Iraq\'s territorial integrity, minimize </p><p>external influence (Iran) and manage sectarian </p><p>rivalries (MbZ, MbR); </p><p> </p><p>-- Express concerns about the activities of Iraqi </p><p>Sunni imam Ahmed Al-Kubaysi (MbZ, MbR). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>BILATERAL MILITARY ISSUES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>Regional Footprint: </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) We have received informal queries from both </p><p>CENTAF and NAVCENT regarding the deployment of </p><p>assets to the UAE.  If appropriate, I would </p><p>recommend that you outline with the leadership -- </p><p>MbR and MbZ -- what we see in terms of our likely </p><p>regional footprint, and specifically what we have </p><p>in mind for the UAE.  The Emiratis have dropped </p><p>strong hints at being open to a more robust </p><p>presence, including an alternate Air Force command </p><p>center, but we need to prepare them for the </p><p>direction in which we are likely to move here. </p><p> </p><p>Afghanistan:  SOC Deployment </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) We are close to finalizing our Memorandum of </p><p>Reference (MOR) with the UAE Armed Forces on the </p><p>deployment of a 40-man Emirati Special Operations </p><p>contingent to Baghram Air Base.  The MOR has become </p><p>mired in the Emirati bureaucracy and it may be </p><p>worthwhile for you to urge MbZ to nudge the process </p><p>forward so that this much anticipated deployment </p><p>does not experience any unnecessary delays.  As you </p><p>know, the UAE continues to play a very helpful role </p><p>in Afghanistan, particularly in the provision of </p><p>humanitarian and reconstruction assistance.  The </p><p>UAE Armed Forces provided the Afghan National Army </p><p>with approximately $50 million in assistance in </p><p>kind in 2002 and overall humanitarian assistance </p><p>has crossed the $30 million mark. </p><p> </p><p>Air Warfare Center </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) MbZ provided the leadership to make possible </p><p>the soon-to-be-inaugurated regional Air Warfare </p><p>Center at Al-Dhafra Air Base in Abu Dhabi.  This </p><p>training facility is a joint CENTAF-UAE Air Force </p><p>project that will eventually host trainers, </p><p>students and aircraft from the GCC and the U.S., UK </p><p>and France.  With a range close by that is larger </p><p>than that located at Nellis AFB, the AWC will </p><p>provide an unmatched opportunity for USAF (and </p><p>eventually NAVCENT and MARCENT) pilots to hone </p><p>their skills in theater.  It comes with the added </p><p>benefit of offering the perfect setting for our </p><p>officers to build long-term relationships with </p><p>their Arab and European coalition counterparts. </p><p>The AWC represents the UAE leadership\'s commitment </p><p>to increasing interoperability with U.S. and </p><p>coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>Defense Cooperation Agreement </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) We need to discuss a successor agreement to </p><p>the dormant, unimplemented Defense Cooperation </p><p>Agreement (DCA), which comes up for renewal in </p><p>2006.  This will require heavy lifting on both </p><p>sides and the sooner we agree on a strategy and </p><p>define our "non-negotiable" items, the easier it </p><p>will be to proceed with the Emiratis.  The past two </p><p>years have been quiet on the DCA front, mostly due </p><p>to the fact that there have been almost no major </p><p>carrier visits to Jebel Ali in Dubai.  Fifth Fleet </p><p>has already indicated that they would like to send </p><p>more carriers our way and we thus anticipate the </p><p>potential for future complications relating to the </p><p>unimplemented DCA.  Your visit would provide a good </p><p>opportunity to resurface this important bilateral </p><p>military issue. </p><p> </p><p>ATACMs/Predator Update -- (If Raised) </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) We are moving forward with the ATACMs 1A </p><p>deal.  The Emiratis have agreed to the principles </p><p>outlined in what will be a regional Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding governing the use of this system.  We </p><p>are awaiting the provision of P&A and the visit in </p><p>July of an U.S. Army team to meet with the Emiratis </p><p>to discuss their exact needs. </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) MbZ raised his desire to procure the </p><p>Predator B with just about every interlocutor in </p><p>Washington.  He believes this system will provide </p><p>him with the much-needed capability to patrol the </p><p>UAE\'s long coast and ward off on any potential </p><p>threats before they reach the shores.  MbZ desires </p><p>an answer to the UAE\'s LOR by year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>BROADER ISSUES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>Concerns About Ahmed Al-Kubaysi </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) We continue to express our concerns to </p><p>senior Emiratis -- including MbR, MbZ and MFA </p><p>Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid -- about the unhelpful </p><p>statements and activities of Iraqi Sunni imam Ahmed </p><p>Al-Kubaysi.  As you know, the Emiratis had placed </p><p>great hopes in Al-Kubaysi to serve as a bridge </p><p>between Sunnis and Shi\'a in order to avert a Shi\'a </p><p>majority power grab.  Al-Kubaysi, who is even a </p><p>controversial figure in Iraqi expat circles in the </p><p>UAE, has proven difficult to manage, though our </p><p>interlocutors assure us that he is "controllable." </p><p>Following our latest expressions of concern, MbR </p><p>told Dubai Consul General Olson that he believes </p><p>Al-Kubaysi has a positive role to play in effecting </p><p>a reconciliation among the Shi\'a, Sunni and Kurdish </p><p>populations.  MbR urged us to use Al-Kubaysi to </p><p>counteract what he sees as a creeping Shi\'a/Iranian </p><p>takeover of Iraq and, along with MbZ and Hamdan, </p><p>has offered to intercede with the Iraqi imam and </p><p>pass any message the USG would like to have hand- </p><p>delivered.  I would strongly recommend that you use </p><p>this visit to personally raise your concerns about </p><p>Al-Kubaysi with both MbZ and MbR. </p><p> </p><p>Iraq:  UAE Humanitarian/Medical Assistance </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) As you know, the Emiratis were among the </p><p>first in the Arab world to step up to the plate in </p><p>providing much-needed humanitarian assistance and </p><p>medical relief to the Iraqi people.  The Embassy, </p><p>the HOC in Kuwait and CENTCOM worked closely with </p><p>the UAE Red Crescent Authority to move supplies </p><p>into Iraq and transport Iraqi patients to the UAE </p><p>for treatment.  This cooperation continues though </p><p>thanks to the fine system put in place by CENTCOM </p><p>and the HOC, the Emiratis are now moving assistance </p><p>into Iraq on an almost daily basis using their own </p><p>transportation.  The Shaykh Zayid hospital in </p><p>Baghdad continues to receive hundreds of patients a </p><p>day and the Emiratis are now considering adopting </p><p>yet another hospital.  Since you last visited with </p><p>MbZ, he has traveled to Iraq where he toured the </p><p>Shaykh Zayid hospital and visited with the UAE </p><p>embassy staff in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
