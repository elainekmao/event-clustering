<p>UNCLAS ROME 003571 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/RA LAWSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, TSPL, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI OFFICIALS LOBBIED FOR MEMBERSHIP IN MIDDLE </p><p>EAST DESALINATION RESEARCH CENTER (MEDRC) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY.  ON JULY 17, DR. CHARLES LAWSON (SPECIAL </p><p>ADVISOR FOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BUREAU OF NEAR EASTERN </p><p>AFFAIRS), ACCOMPANIED BY EMB OFFS, MET WITH LUCA FRATINI, </p><p>DEPUTY OFFICE DIRECTOR IN THE MFA\'S MIDDLE EAST BUREAU, </p><p>    AMBASSADOR MARIO SICA (FORMER ITALIAN AMBASSADOR TO EGYPT), </p><p>AND MINISTER EUGENIO CAMPO (DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR </p><p>COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT).  THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING WAS </p><p>TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE ITALIAN MEMBERSHIP IN THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>DESALINATION RESEARCH CENTER (MEDRC). ITALY IS INTERESTED BUT </p><p>IS NOT ABLE TO MAKE A FINANCIAL COMMITMENT AT THIS TIME. </p><p>SPECIFIC TRAINING PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDRC OBJECTIVES </p><p>COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR FUNDING ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) LAWSON, A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF MEDRC, </p><p>MET WITH MFA REPRESENTATIVES TOGETHER WITH THE MEDRC\'S </p><p>DIRECTOR, KOUSSAI QUTEISHAT, AND MEDRC\'S DIRECTOR OF </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, SHANNON MCCARTHY, TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>ITALY\'S JOINING MEDRC AS A FULL MEMBER BECAUSE OF STRONG </p><p>ITALIAN INTEREST IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>MEDRC IS A RESEARCH INSTITUTE WHOSE MISSION IS TO CONDUCT, </p><p>FACILITATE, PROMOTE, COORDINATE, AND SUPPORT BASIC AND </p><p>APPLIED RESEARCH IN WATER DESALINATION TECHNOLOGY AND </p><p>SUPPORTING FIELDS.  ACCORDING TO LAWSON, MEMBER STATES HAVE </p><p>EACH HISTORICALLY CONTRIBUTED ONE-TIME AMOUNTS OF $3 MILLION </p><p>TO THE CENTER SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN 1993.  CURRENT </p><p>MEMBERS INCLUDE THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN, THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>KOREA, THE SULTANATE OF OMAN, AND ISRAEL.  THE EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMISSION HAS ALSO CONTRIBUTED FUNDS TO THE CENTER, BUT </p><p>REMAINS AN OBSERVER, NOT A FULL MEMBER.  LAWSON EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT PROJECTS, WHICH INVOLVE BOTH ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS, </p><p>ARE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN CONTINUING DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>PARTIES, AND DESALINATION RESEARCH HAS BEEN A VALUABLE </p><p>CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION. </p><p> </p><p>    3.  (U) GOI REPRESENTATIVES FOCUSED ON TWO ASPECTS OF THE </p><p>DISCUSSION: ACTUAL ITALIAN MEMBERSHIP IN MEDRC, AND FINANCING </p><p>ITALY\'S MEMBERSHIP.  THE ITALIANS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE </p><p>WORK OF MEDRC, BUT ALSO CONCERNS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL </p><p>COMMITMENT NECESSARY FOR MEMBERSHIP.  AS THE MFA HAS </p><p>UNDERGONE SERIOUS BUDGET RESTRICTIONS RECENTLY, AND ITALY HAS </p><p>BEEN CONTRIBUTING TO RECONSTRUCTION IN AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, </p><p>AFRICA AND THE BALKANS, THE FUNDS ARE JUST NOT AVAILABLE FOR </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THE SHORT TERM.  HOWEVER, MFA OFFICIALS SAID </p><p>THEY WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF MEMBERSHIP </p><p>IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE GOI.  THE DG FOR COOPERATION FOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT (C&D) WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT FUNDING MEMBERSHIP </p><p>IN MEDRC BECAUSE THE DG HAS A SPECIFIC LIST OF TARGET </p><p>COUNTRIES TO WHICH FUNDS CAN BE ALLOCATED, AND SOME MEMBERS </p><p>OF MEDRC DO NOT MEET THOSE CRITERIA.  LAWSON HAD MET WITH </p><p>COUNSELOR GIORGIO TRABATTONI FROM THE DG C&D THE PREVIOUS </p><p>DAY, WHO EXPRESSED SIMILAR FINANCIAL CONCERNS.  TRABATTONI </p><p>INDICATED THAT MEDRC MEMBERSHIP WOULD BE OF POTENTIAL </p><p>INTEREST TO ITALY.  WHILE THE QUESTION OF FULL MEMBERSHIP IS </p><p>BEING DISCUSSED, HOWEVER, DG C&D ENCOURAGED MEDRC TO PASS </p><p>ALONG SPECIFIC PROJECTS IN COUNTRIES WHICH DG C & D COULD </p><p>POTENTIALLY FUND, ESPECIALLY TRAINING PROGRAMS WHICH COULD BE </p><p>OFFERED IN ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEETING, AMBASSADOR SICA </p><p>PROMISED TO REPORT TO THE DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST, AMB. SESSA, ABOUT THEIR DISCUSSIONS AND THE CONDITIONS </p><p>UNDER WHICH ITALY COULD BECOME A MEMBER OF MEDRC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THIS CABLE WAS PREPARED BY ROME SCI INTERN LISA </p><p>    GEORGE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03571 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
