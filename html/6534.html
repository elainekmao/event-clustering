Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B), (C), and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S//NF) Following up on his March 17 request (ref b), </p><p>Ambassador pressed MFA U/S Ziyal March 18 to take action in </p><p>response to USG concerns over the threat posed by </p><p>intelligence officers of the Iraqi government operating under </p><p>official cover in Turkey.  Ambassador asked Ziyal if he had </p><p>spoken with TNIO following their March 17 meeting, as Ziyal </p><p>indicated he would.  Ziyal said he had been consumed with the </p><p>larger question of USG requests on Iraq March 17 (ref c), and </p><p>confessed that he had not had an opportunity to raise the </p><p>issue with TNIO.  Ziyal took note of the Ambassador,s </p><p>request and said he would discuss the issue with TNIO soon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S//NF) MFA Deputy U/S Tuygan (who was present at the </p><p>meeting) noted that he recently had discussed the issue with </p><p>TNIO.  Tuygan said that TNIO had told him that none of the </p><p>individuals included on the second list of names the Embassy </p><p>had provided the MFA were in Turkey.  Tuygan said that TNIO </p><p>continued to monitor closely the activities of the </p><p>individuals listed on the first list provided by the Embassy </p><p>(the staff at the Iraqi embassy).  However, Tuygan noted that </p><p>TNIO has not found any evidence that these individuals were </p><p>involved in &fishy8 activities.  Tuygan said that the MFA </p><p>would go back to TNIO and ask them to continue to keep a </p><p>close eye on the individuals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S//NF) The Ambassador stressed that the USG was looking </p><p>to the GOT to take action against Iraqi intelligence officers </p><p>in Ankara, including having them leave the country.  He </p><p>reminded Ziyal and Tuygan that the USG had seen evidence of </p><p>such activity worldwide.  After passing this information to </p><p>government authorities in these countries, the governments </p><p>took action against the Iraqi intelligence officers, and this </p><p>action resulted in disrupting the planned activities against </p><p>USG interests. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
