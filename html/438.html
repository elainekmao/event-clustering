CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  RED SQUARE\'S KAZAN CATHEDRAL, A POWERFUL RUSSIAN </p><p>PATRIOTIC SYMBOL BLOWN UP BY STALIN, IS TO BE </p><p>REBUILT.  CONSERVATVE RUSSIENS CHEER WHILE LIBERAL </p><p>ORTHODOX BELIEVERS FRET THAT THE REBUILDING MAY PLAY </p><p>INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO USE THE </p><p>RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH (ROC) FOR RUSSIAN NATIONALIST </p><p>AS OPPOSED TO SPIRITUAL ENDS.  THE ROC\'S FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER UNDERSTANDS THESE CONCERNS; NEVERTHELESS, HE </p><p>IS GAMBLING THAT CONSERVATIVES\' INTEREST IN THE </p><p>REBUILDING WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD THEM TO BELIEVE IN </p><p>THE ROC INSTEAD OF SIMPLY WANTING TO USE IT.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL ON MOSCOW\'S RED SQUARE USED </p><p>TO BE ONE OF RUSSIA\'S MOST REVERED RELIGIOUS AND </p><p>HISTORIC SHRINES.  IT WAS BUILT DURING THE REIGN OF </p><p>THE FIRST ROMANOV TSAR.  PTER THE GREAT LATER </p><p>INSPECTED TROOPS UPON THEIR RETURN FROM THE POLTAVA </p><p>BATTLE IN FRONT OF IT AND CELEBRATIONS WERE HELD </p><p>THERE AFTER NAPOLEON\'S RETREAT FROM MOSCOW.  AFTER </p><p>1917, THE CATHEDRAL WAS FORCEFULLY TAKEN AWAY FROM </p><p>THE ROC AND FELL INTO DISREPAIR.  TOUSANDS OF RUBLES </p><p>WERE SPENT RESTORING IT IN THE 1920S -- UNTIL ITS </p><p>CHIEF RESTORER WAS PACKED OFF TO SIBERIA AND THE </p><p>CATHEDRAL WAS BLOWN UP BY STALIN.  THE CATHEDRAL\'S </p><p>FOUNDATIONS WERE LATER GRACED FOR A TIME BY PUBLIC </p><p>TOILETS AND NOW STAND EMPTY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ON JUNE 5, 1990 THE NEW MOSCOW CITY GOVERNMENT </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THE CATHEDRAL WOULD BE REBUILT ON ITS </p><p>ORIGINAL FOUNDATIONS BY THE MOSCOW DIVISION OF THE </p><p>ALL-RUSSIA SOCIETY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF HISTORICAL </p><p>MONUMENTS AND CULTURE (SEE REF A).  THE COST IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO TOTAL ONE MILLION RUBLES.  MONEY FOR THE </p><p>REBUILDING IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED FROM PRIVATE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS.  THE CATHEDRAL IS SCHEDULED TO BE READY </p><p>IN TIME FOR MOSCOW\'S 850TH ANNIVERSARY IN 1995. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THIS DEVELOPMENT OBVIOUSLY DID NOT ESCAPE THE </p><p>NOTICE OF THE ROC\'S NEWLY-ELECTED PATRIARCH, ALEXEI </p><p>II, WHO RECENTLY WEIGHED IN IN SUPPORT OF THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE.  ON NOVEMBER 4, ALEXEI II ORGANIZED A </p><p>TRIUMPHAL MARCH FROM THE KREMLIN\'S USPENSKIY </p><p>CATHEDRAL (RECENTLY RECLAIMED FOR OCCASIONAL ROC </p><p>RELIGIOUS SERVICES) TO THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL\'S EMPTY </p><p>LOT, WHERE HE LED RELIGIOUS SERVICES, BLESSED THE </p><p>REBUILDING\'S FIRST STONE, AND ADDRESSED THE ATTENDING </p><p>FAITHFUL, FOLLOWED BY A SPEECH BY MOSCOW MAYOR </p><p>GAVRIIL POPOV. </p><p> </p><p>6.  VISITING AMERICAN SCHOLARS WHO ATTENDED THE </p><p>CEREMONY TOLD POLOFF LATER THAT FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND </p><p>MUSCOVITES WERE ALSO PRESENT.  THEIR IMPRESSION WAS </p><p>THAT ALEXEI II HAD EXCELLENT CONTACT WITH THE CROWD, </p><p>WHO LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO HIS ADDRESS.  HEARING HIM </p><p>WAS NOT A PROBLEM, AS AN "AMERICAN QUALITY" SOUND </p><p>SYSTEM BOOMED HIS WORDS, THE RELIGIOUS SERVICE AND </p><p>ACCOMPANYING BELL CHIMES ALL OVER RED SQUARE.  THE </p><p>AMERICANS\' COMMENT: "LENIN MUST HAVE BEEN ROLLING </p><p>OVER IN HIS GLASS BOX A FEW FEET AWAY." </p><p> </p><p>7.  DISCUSSIONS AMONG VARIOUS ROC ACTIVISTS AND OTHER </p><p>OPINION LEADERS HAVE RESULTED IN A CONSENSUS THAT THE </p><p>KAZAN CATHEDRAL WILL INDEED BE REBUILT IN SOME FORM </p><p>BUT MIXED FEELINGS AS TO THE USEFULNESS OF THIS </p><p>ENDEAVOR.  STRONGLY IN THE PRO-REBUILDING CAMP ARE A </p><p>NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVE AND RUSSIAN NATIONALIST </p><p>FIGURES, SUCH AS "LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA" JOURNALISTS </p><p>AND "NASH SOVREMENNIK" EDITOR AND WRITER STANISLAV </p><p>KUNYAYEV (SEE REF B).  THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE </p><p>FIGURES ARE AGNOSTICS OR ATHEISTS DOES NOT AFFECT </p><p>THEIR SUPPORT, WHICH IS BASED ON THE DESIRE TO REVIVE </p><p>RUSSIA\'S GLORIOUS PAST (SYMBOLIZED BY THE CATHEDRAL), </p><p>REGARDLESS OF HOW THIS AFFECTS THE FORTUNES OF THE </p><p>ROC. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN THE OTHER CAMP, LIBERAL ROC LEADERS SUCH AS </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST VIKTOR POPKOV STRONGLY OPPOSE </p><p>THE REBUILDING.  ONE OF THEIR REASONS IS PRECISELY </p><p>THAT THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL HAS BECOME MORE OF A </p><p>NATIONALISTIC THAN A RELIGIOUS SYMBOL.  THEY ARE </p><p>CONVINCED THAT ITS REBUILDING WOULD ENCOURAGE THE </p><p>TENDENCY TO HAVE ORTHODOXY SERVE NATIONALIST AS </p><p>OPPOSED TO MORAL ENDS.  POPKOV SPOKE FOR MANY LIBERAL </p><p>ROC BELIEVERS WHEN HE TOLD POLOFF: "THE ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH SPENT ENOUGH TIME SERVING THE STATE UNDER THE </p><p>TSARS.  IF ANY GOOD AT ALL COULD STILL COME OUT OF </p><p>THE REVOLUTION IT WOULD BE TO CREATE A TRUE DIVISION </p><p>BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE IN THIS COUNTRY."  ANOTHER </p><p>REASON IS MORE PROSAIC.  WITH THOUSANDS OF BADLY </p><p>DILAPIDATED CHURCHES NOW BEING HANDED OVER TO THE ROC </p><p>ALL OVER THE USSR, LIBERALS BELIEVE THAT ONE MILLION </p><p>RUBLES COULD BE MUCH BETTER SPENT REVIVING WORSHIP </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY INSTEAD OF TYING IT UP IN ONE </p><p>MORE CHURCH IN MOSCOW. </p><p> </p><p>9.  AS HAS BECOME HIS CUSTOM, ROC FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>ARCHBISHOP KIRILL -- REPUTED TO BE THE SMARTEST MAN </p><p>IN THE ROC -- HAS STAKED OUT A POSITION SOMEWHERE IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE.  HE RECENTLY TOLD POLOFF THAT HE WAS WELL </p><p>AWARE OF THE VARIOUS CONCERNS SURROUNDING PROPOSALS </p><p>TO REBUILD THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL (AND THE SIMILAR </p><p>SITUATION OF THE CHRIST THE SAVIOR CATHEDRAL, BLOWN </p><p>UP AND REPLACED BY AN OUTDOOR PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL). </p><p>HE ADDED THAT HE TOOK THESE CONCERNS SO SERIOUSLY </p><p>THAT HE HAD DELAYED RECOMMENDING OPEN SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>REBUILDINGS TO PATRIARCH ALEXEI II WHILE HE MET WITH </p><p>A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE SUBJECT AND WEIGHED THE </p><p>PROS AND CONS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ARCHBISHOP KIRILL EXPLAINED WHY HE HAD </p><p>EVENTUALLY COME OUT IN FAVOR OF ROC SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>ENDEAVORS.  FINANCIALLY, HE REALIZED IT MADE SENSE. </p><p>AFTER CANVASSING WOULD-BE DONORS, HE BECAME CONVINCED </p><p>THAT IF THIS OPTION WERE NOT AVAILABLE THEY WOULD </p><p>SIMPLY NOT GIVE ANY MONEY AT ALL TO THE ROC: "WE\'RE </p><p>NOT TAKING ONE MILLION RUBLES AWAY FROM STARVING </p><p>PARISHES; WE\'RE EITHER ACCEPTING OR REJECTING ONE </p><p>MILLION RUBLES."  AS FOR THE MORE DELICATE </p><p>NATIONALISM ASPECT, THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT HE HAD </p><p>COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS STILL AN OPEN </p><p>QUESTION OF WHO WOULD INFLUENCE WHOM: "IGNORING THEM </p><p>(CONSERVATIVES AND NATIONALISTS) IS NOT THE ANSWER -- </p><p>BY GETTING INVOLVED, THEY MAY COME TO BELIEVE IN US </p><p>INSTEAD OF WANTING TO USE US." </p><p> </p><p>11.  LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>MATLOCK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
