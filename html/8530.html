Further, the </p><p>lack of reliable banking institutions, and the resulting </p><p>prevalence of NGOs and businesses having to keep large </p><p>amounts of cash on hand has also increased crime rates. </p><p>While the principal impediment to attracting foreign </p><p>commercial banks ) the passage of the commercial banking law </p><p>and the central banking law ) are still unresolved, some </p><p>positive developments are expected soon. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Ministry of Finance has been trying ) without </p><p>success - for at least the past eight months to attract two </p><p>foreign banks.  The Ministry of Commerce secured a visit from </p><p>officials of Britain,s Standard Chartered during a visit to </p><p>London in the spring of 2003.  Standard Chartered is now </p><p>reported to open its first branch in Afghanistan in August </p><p>2003.

(SBU) During the past week, U.S. entrepreneur Jack Heidary </p><p>visited Kabul to discuss opening a $25-$50m OPIC-financed </p><p>commercial bank.  Heidary met with Afghan government </p><p>officials including Minister of Finance Ghani, Minister of </p><p>Commerce Kazimi, Central Bank Governor Ahady, and Embassy and </p><p>U.S. military representatives to assess the viability of a </p><p>commercial bank.  Heidary,s due diligence visit will inform </p><p>a report to OPIC officials regarding the mix of services, </p><p>locations and clientele for this project.  Among the services </p><p>contemplated are US Dollar and Afghan afghani direct deposit </p><p>accounts for the Afghan civil service, NGO, and international </p><p>military and diplomatic community officials.  Heidary </p><p>suggested bank branches may be based in Kabul and other major </p><p>cities at first, and also explored the possibility of </p><p>providing ATM services. </p><p>HANSON </p><p></p></div>
