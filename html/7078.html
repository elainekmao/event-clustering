<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 002009 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>STATE PASS USPTO FOR URBAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KIPR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: Jordanian IPR Enforcement: Good on Interdiction, </p><p>Weak on Prosecution </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Amman 1233 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  The GOJ has made good progress implementing </p><p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) legislation in the last </p><p>two years.  As a result, the share of pirated material in </p><p>the market has dropped considerably since 2000.  Despite </p><p>this progress, though, the current system has some flaws. </p><p>There is a need to improve coordination between departments </p><p>and to improve the human and financial resources of </p><p>implementing bodies (notably the National Library).   The </p><p>IPR legislation itself has some limitations that need </p><p>addressing as well, in particular the overlap between civil </p><p>and criminal law that allows most IPR violators to escape </p><p>serious punishment.  We continue to work with a number of </p><p>GOJ agencies to encourage continued reform and improvement </p><p>of the IPR environment.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>What Works:  Customs Interdiction Procedures </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Current GOJ Customs procedure differentiates </p><p>between commercial shipments and personal items </p><p>accompanying travelers.  Commercial shipments arriving at </p><p>any point of entry must be cleared at one of the main </p><p>customs clearing centers - the Queen Alia International </p><p>Airport (QAIA) and the Amman Customs House. Under current </p><p>practice, more than 20 copies of a single or multiple </p><p>titles (for a/v and software products) constitute </p><p>"commercial quantities."  Personal a/v or software property </p><p>is collected by the customs house of the point of entry and </p><p>sent to the Amman Customs Clearing Center.  The traveler is </p><p>given a receipt for redeeming his property in Amman. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Based on our observations at the Syrian border </p><p>crossing points and the Amman Customs House, Jordanian </p><p>customs officials are fairly adept at spotting and </p><p>interdicting counterfeit goods.  While they do not have a </p><p>"profile" developed for potential smugglers of pirated a/v </p><p>and software goods, their professional experience - and </p><p>periodic training from WIPO, USAID, and other organizations </p><p>- gives them a good sense for spotting potential importers </p><p>of such goods.  However, due to the small size of such </p><p>products (hundreds can fit in a shoebox), it is extremely </p><p>difficult for customs officials to completely stop the flow </p><p>of pirated goods. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Once IPR-related goods arrive at the Amman </p><p>Clearing Center, samples are sent to the Censorship Office </p><p>in the Ministry of Information, which inspects it to ensure </p><p>it does not contain "culturally or politically offensive" </p><p>material (i.e., in most cases, pornography or items </p><p>critical of the royal family).  The Censorship Office does </p><p>not check for copyright infringements. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  In parallel to this process, the clearing center </p><p>assesses shipments for copyright infringements and informs </p><p>the National Library (NL) in writing of receipt of </p><p>questionable commercial shipments and any questionable </p><p>personal items exceeding 20 CD\'s per traveler. If the NL </p><p>concludes after inspecting the goods that they are pirated, </p><p>they inform Customs, which in turn informs the registered </p><p>authorized agents about the interdiction. The agent then </p><p>has eight days to file a legal case against the importer. </p><p>If the eight days pass without such an action from the </p><p>agent, or if there is no registered agent, then Customs </p><p>releases the pirated goods to the importer.  (Note:  This </p><p>system places most of the initial prosecutorial burden on </p><p>the registered agent.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>National Library Still Struggling to Exert Authority </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>6.    (u)    The National Library is part of the Ministry </p><p>of Cultural Affairs.  Its Director General, Ma\'amoun </p><p>Talhouni, reports directly to the Minister of Cultural </p><p>Affairs. In addition to its role of monitoring and </p><p>registering copyrights, the Library has several functions </p><p>that dilute its resources allocated to IPR enforcement, </p><p>including archiving and repository functions for all </p><p>Jordanian intellectual property productions and GOJ </p><p>official documents, documenting national bibliographies, </p><p>and supervising public libraries. The NL functions are </p><p>spread over 9 departments, one of which is the Protection </p><p>of IPR Office. While the Library is responsible for </p><p>copyright enforcement related to printed materials, a/v and </p><p>software, other aspects of IPR are the responsibility of </p><p>other government departments. For example, the Ministry of </p><p>Industry and Trade is responsible for trademark and patent </p><p>enforcement, often in conjunction with other agencies (like </p><p>the Health Ministry for new drug registrations, e.g.). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  Current law entrusts the Library with monitoring </p><p>the market for pirated printed, a/v, and software goods. </p><p>Talhouni notes that the law limits the Library\'s authority </p><p>to monitoring and inspection of licensed shops only. The </p><p>Library is powerless to inspect or interdict street </p><p>venders, for example.  Thus it is not uncommon for shop </p><p>owners to store pirated goods close to their place of </p><p>business but not physically inside it to avoid prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (u)  The Library has only six IPR officers on staff to </p><p>conduct inspections of shops country-wide.  These officers </p><p>are sometimes supported by local police forces at their </p><p>request.  While this staff is dedicated and well-trained, </p><p>it faces many technical obstacles to effective monitoring </p><p>and interdiction.  When a Library officer finds pirated </p><p>materials in a licensed shop, it confiscates the materials </p><p>and proceeds to legal action.  However, since registered </p><p>agents are frequently unwilling to press charges against </p><p>violators for fear of alienating customers and losing </p><p>legitimate sales, much of the Library\'s work goes for </p><p>naught. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (u)  At the same time, the technical process for </p><p>confiscating goods is cumbersome - officers must catalogue </p><p>every copy of a title they take, often by hand, to </p><p>facilitate return of the merchandise to the shopkeeper if </p><p>it turns out to be legitimate or the registered agent does </p><p>not prosecute.  And shopkeepers often sell pirated product </p><p>only after-hours, when officers are not on duty to monitor </p><p>the shops. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>What Doesn\'t Work: Legislation, Prosecution </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (u)  The Jordan Intellectual Property Association </p><p>(JIPA) reports a significant improvement in enforcement </p><p>action on copyright issues by the GOJ.  According to their </p><p>statistics, in the year 2000 no CD\'s were confiscated, </p><p>1,782 were confiscated in 2001, and 37,084 in 2002.  They </p><p>note also that the Library brought 6 copyright infringement </p><p>cases before the courts in 2000, compared to 149 in 2001 </p><p>and 274 in 2002.  A local law office specializing in IPR </p><p>similarly noted that while in 1995, 87% of all CD\'s on the </p><p>local market were pirated, the number dropped to 67% by </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (u)  Despite this improvement, though, most agents, </p><p>lawyers, and even enforcement bodies maintain that current </p><p>laws are not strong enough to fully deter violators. The </p><p>current legislation limits the jurisdiction of the Library </p><p>to licensed shops, does not allow Customs or the Library to </p><p>take legal action against violators absent a complaint by </p><p>the relevant authorized agent, and allows judges to reduce </p><p>FTA- and WTO-mandated sentences for violators, making fines </p><p>far less of a deterrent to selling unauthorized goods. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (u)  Jordan does not have a special court dedicated to </p><p>adjudicating intellectual property cases.  IPR lawyers </p><p>complain that courts may take several months, and sometimes </p><p>more than a year or two, to reach a verdict on IP related </p><p>complaints.  And even when those complaints are </p><p>successfully prosecuted, they are frequently overruled on </p><p>appeal or by the Supreme Court, as appellate and Supreme </p><p>Court judges are less sensitized to the finer points of </p><p>Jordan\'s new IPR laws, and tend in any case to have more </p><p>sympathy for shop owners than registered agents. </p><p>Meanwhile, as court cases drag on, the defendant is usually </p><p>free to return to his shop, and often resumes sales of </p><p>unauthorized product immediately. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (u)  Even cases that are ultimately successfully </p><p>prosecuted, sources say, make little or no dent on the </p><p>availability of illicit product.  Private sector sources </p><p>note that judges tend to be lenient when issuing verdicts, </p><p>and often rely on clauses in the criminal and penal codes </p><p>to reduce penalties for IPR violations.  Thus a guilty </p><p>party facing an initial penalty of JD 6,000 ($8,460) under </p><p>civil law will usually have his sentence dramatically </p><p>reduced to an insignificant amount, in some cases as low as </p><p>JD 20 ($28) by appellate court judges under the </p><p>"humanitarian relief" clause of the criminal code (Article </p><p>100), which gives the court the latitude to modify </p><p>sentences that would cause undue hardship on the </p><p>convicted\'s family. This is possible since although the IP </p><p>law is a civil law, it has a penal aspect to it in the form </p><p>of fine and/or imprisonment that allows judges to invoke </p><p>articles from otherwise irrelevant criminal or penal codes. </p><p>As a result, IPR violators go essentially unpunished, </p><p>paying off their fines through sales of additional illicit </p><p>product in a matter of hours. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Fixing the System </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (u)  Despite its shortcomings, Jordan\'s IPR regime is </p><p>lauded by international IPR watchers as a model for the </p><p>region.  The GOJ remains willing and eager to improve its </p><p>protection of intellectual property rights, seeing a </p><p>stronger regime as an excellent marketing tool for </p><p>attracting knowledge-based investments into the kingdom. </p><p>Jordan is keen to build a "knowledge-based economy," and </p><p>thus should continue to respond favorably to any overtures </p><p>that would help it improve IPR protections. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (u)  An AMIR-funded study of Jordan\'s IPR regime, </p><p>published on July 17, 2002, praised the work of the </p><p>National Library, and noted areas where additional </p><p>resources and training would help improve the Library\'s </p><p>ability to enforce IPR laws in Jordan.  Using this report </p><p>as a starting point, we are working with the Library, </p><p>Customs, and the private sector to identify programs that </p><p>could be put to best use to improve capacity in the </p><p>government, including the courts, to police IPR violators. </p><p>In addition to training programs through USAID, we are </p><p>looking at ways to better use International Visitor (IV) </p><p>and guest speaker programs to heighten IPR awareness in </p><p>Jordan\'s government structure, the local business </p><p>community, and the press.  For example, we plan to send a </p><p>group of publishers on an IV program next fiscal year, </p><p>during which they will be exposed to IPR issues in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (u)  We will also soon begin to look at IPR-related </p><p>legislation itself, with an eye toward improving the </p><p>foundation on which good IPR enforcement is based.  This </p><p>could mean, inter alia, finding a way to deconflict </p><p>Jordan\'s civil and criminal laws so that decisions made in </p><p>one arena are not reversed on technicalities in another. </p><p>It could also mean looking at current enforcement laws to </p><p>find ways to broaden the scope of the Library\'s authority, </p><p>and to improve communications among various government </p><p>agencies involved in IPR enforcement.  Ultimately, we may </p><p>also look at the feasibility of encouraging the GOJ to move </p><p>the copyright function out of the Library and put it, for </p><p>example, in the Trade Ministry, where it could be better </p><p>funded and staffed. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
