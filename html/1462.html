<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008622 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/28/2010 </p><p>TAGS: CG, PGOV, PHUM, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: MONUC FORCE COMMANDER ON CURRENT SITUATION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(C) (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY </p><p>     On December 28, Ambassador Swing met with MONUC Force </p><p>Commander Mountaga Diallo, acting in absence of SRSG Kamel </p><p>Morjane, and SRSG Chief of Staff Sow, to review developments </p><p>in the Congo war in general and his visit to Zambia from </p><p>which he had just returned the evening before. Diallo is </p><p>appealing to New York to assist Zambia handle the large </p><p>numbers of Congolese soldiers and civilians who have fled to </p><p>northern Zambia in the wake of Pweto\'s fall to Rwandan and </p><p>RCD forces.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) FAC Soldiers in Zambia </p><p>     General Diallo confirmed that there are 3374 "declared" </p><p>FAC (Congolese government) soldiers presently at two </p><p>locations in Zambia after fleeing the Rwandan RCD attack on </p><p>Pweto.  Although all are "declared" as FAC, there are </p><p>undoubtedly some Interahamwe, ex-FAR and Burundian FDD </p><p>elements among them, but their numbers are not presently </p><p>known. </p><p>     The immediate issue facing Zambian authorities is how to </p><p>lodge and feed the FAC soldiers.  To support them is quite </p><p>costly, Diallo said.  In addition, the soldiers are being </p><p>accommodated in school buildings, and schools in Zambia are </p><p>scheduled to begin in a few days.  The ICRC is reviewing this </p><p>situation to determine its ability to assist but has not yet </p><p>responded officially.  There are also, reportedly, large </p><p>numbers of other FAC soldiers possibly taking refuge in the </p><p>extreme northwestern corner of Zambia on Lake Tanganyika, but </p><p>no one has seen them as yet. </p><p>     In addition to the FAC soldiers, there are an additional </p><p>34,000 Congolese civilians registered in two camps near the </p><p>DRC border in northern Zambia, and many others not </p><p>registered--all of whom arrived in the days following the </p><p>fall of Pweto at the beginning of the month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SADC Force Concern Re Zambia/Rwanda Talks </p><p>     SADC Force Commander Chingombwe (Zimbabwe) had expressed </p><p>concern to him earlier in the day, Diallo said, about </p><p>discussions taking place between Zambia and Rwanda. </p><p>Chingombwe claimed that these concerned a desire by Rwanda to </p><p>use Zambian territory from which to launch an attack on </p><p>Lubumbashi. (Diallo discounted this allegation, saying that </p><p>he had just spoken with a senior Zambian official (Silambwa) </p><p>who told him that the discussions related to Rwanda\'s concern </p><p>about the FDD\'s having been able to cross back into the DRC </p><p>after having fled to Zambia.)  Nonetheless, Diallo said that </p><p>Chingombwe may go public with an expression of concern about </p><p>the talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) An Appeal to Help Zambia </p><p>     Diallo said "Zambia needs help."  The UNHCR, he said, </p><p>cannot help unless the FAC soldiers renounce their military </p><p>status and accept refugee status.  To date, only some 200 had </p><p>been willing to do so. </p><p>     Zambia needs international support to keep the FAC </p><p>soldiers in Zambia.  Diallo expressed concern that Rwanda </p><p>would cause problems should the FAC (and negative force </p><p>elements) be allowed to return to the DRC. </p><p>     General Diallo viewed positively Kabila\'s request to see </p><p>Zambian President Chiluba (according to word Diallo had from </p><p>his talk with Silambwa).  The meeting would likely take place </p><p>at Lubumbashi or Lusaka. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Sub-Plans and National Dialogue </p><p>     The MLC continues to insist that it will not sign the </p><p>disengagement sub-plans unless the issue of the national </p><p>dialogue is effectively addressed.  Diallo said that MLC </p><p>leader Bemba is not opposed to co-facilitation by Masire and </p><p>Gabonese president Bongo. </p><p>     The RCD now appears to be backtracking on its commitment </p><p>to the disengagement sub-plans, saying that its earlier </p><p>signing is suspended until (a) there is renewed commitment to </p><p>the national dialogue; (b) MONUC deploys; and (c) disarmament </p><p>of the "negative forces" has begun. </p><p>     In these regards, Diallo was somewhat pessimistic that </p><p>the earlier postponed Kampala meeting of belligerent chiefs </p><p>of staff would in fact take place on the new date of January </p><p>10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Urgent JPC Requested </p><p>     Force Commander Diallo has asked the Zambians to urge </p><p>the chairman to convene an urgent meeting of the Joint </p><p>Political Commission (JPC).  Given the upcoming New Year\'s </p><p>holiday, this meeting might not be possible until the second </p><p>week of January. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) UN Deployment Technical Team </p><p>     Asked about the status of the UN technical assessment </p><p>mission due to arrive January 3 as a precursor to MONUC </p><p>deployment, General Diallo said he feared that New York may </p><p>be having second thoughts about sending the team just now in </p><p>the light of military developments in Katanga and Equateur. </p><p>     Diallo is urging the UN to send the team, on the date </p><p>scheduled, arguing that positive efforts are being made to </p><p>move the Lusaka process forward (the January 10 Kampala </p><p>meeting of Chiefs of Staff; the proposed JPC meetings; and </p><p>Libreville II in the second half of January). </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
