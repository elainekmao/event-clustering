<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOGADISHU 02896 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  MCAP, PINS, PREL, SO, LY, IZ, XF </p><p>SUBJECT:  LIBYAN AND IRAQI RECRUITING ATTRACTS </p><p>          SOMALI APPLICANTS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN RECENT DAYS, FLIERS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED BY </p><p>THE LIBYAN EMBASSY AROUND THE CITY OF MOGADISHU WHICH </p><p>SEEK RECRUITS FOR AN "ALL-ARAB ARMY".  THE "ARMY" IS </p><p>AIMED AT FIGHTING "IMPERIALISM AND ZIONISM" AND ON </p><p>FREEING ARAB LANDS FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE ARABIAN </p><p>GULF FROM FOREIGN DOMINATION.  THE FLIERS TELL </p><p>PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS TO GO TO THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S </p><p>BUREAU IN MOGADISHU, WHERE THEY WILL BE TREATED </p><p>"AS LIBYANS".  SIMILAR FLIERS ARE REPORTEDLY BEING </p><p>PASSED AROUND BY THE IRAQI EMBASSY, AS WELL.  THE LIBYAN </p><p>FLIER IDENTIFIES AS PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES THOSE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SOME TECHNICAL OR MILITARY TRAINING. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  THERE HAVE BEEN LARGE CROWDS OUTSIDE THE LIBYAN </p><p>AND IRAQI MISSIONS HERE, LIKELY IN RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>FLIERS.  ON BOTH MARCH 12 AND 13 POLICE DISPERSED </p><p>THE CROWDS, AND ON THE MORNING OF MARCH 13, THE </p><p>MILITIA, WHICH IS ORGANIZED BY THE SINGLE POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY HERE, WAS TAKING INTO CUSTODY THOSE PEOPLE WHO </p><p>REMAINED HANGING AROUND THE LIBYAN MISSION. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  THE SOMALIS HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE </p><p>GETTING ENOUGH RECRUITS TO MAN THEIR OWN ARMY, </p><p>AND HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SEND PRESS GANGS PERI- </p><p>ODICALLY AROUND THE CITY.  THEY PROBABLY WILL LOOK </p><p>ASKANCE AT SOMALIS RESPONDING FAVORABLY TO A FOR- </p><p>EIGN MILITARY RECRUITMENT.  SO FAR THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY HAS NOT CALLED IN EITHER THE LIBYANS </p><p>OR THE IRAQIS TO COMPLAIN OF THESE RECRUITMENT </p><p>EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIDGES </p><p></p></div>
