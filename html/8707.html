<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001217 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION DROC; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "U. N.\'s indifference to DRC conflict </p><p>      disturbing" the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" dedicated its June 13 editorial to accusing </p><p>      the United Nations of dragging its feet in solving </p><p>      the political discord in the Democratic Republic of </p><p>      Congo (DRC).  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Reports coming out of the DRC. . .make depressing </p><p>      reading and make the sincerity of the United Nations </p><p>      in solving conflicts in Africa questionable.  The U. </p><p>      N. is mandated to stop conflicts and maintain peace </p><p>      and security, yet Congolese nationals in the Ituri </p><p>      province of the vast country have been killing each </p><p>      other while the U. N. stands by. . .It was not until </p><p>      fairly recently that the U. N. decided to move in. </p><p>      So far, its involvement has . . .been </p><p>      lukewarm. . .Reports say that the U. N. has deployed </p><p>      700 peacekeepers in the war-torn country, a figure </p><p>      which, given the size of the DRC and the complexity </p><p>      of the situation, we feel is negligible.  While </p><p>      these few and ill-equipped `monitors\' are sauntering </p><p>      about in the DRC, the fighting is raging </p><p>      on. . .Africa has never meant much for the U. S. or </p><p>      other influential members of the U. N. Security </p><p>      Council, hence the apparent slow manner in which the </p><p>      U. N. has been moving over the DRC issue. . .We feel </p><p>      that the U. N. has the capacity - but lacks the </p><p>      will - to mobilize a big enough force to stop the </p><p>      carnage in the DRC. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
