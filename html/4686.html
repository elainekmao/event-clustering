<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 001587 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: USDA TO IMPLEMENT SENIOR GENERAL,S PLAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: The Union Solidarity Development Association </p><p>(USDA) finally held its annual general meeting on November </p><p>15, about two months after it was initially expected. </p><p>Apparently Senior General Than Shwe had to overcome </p><p>resistence by some members before the event could be staged. </p><p>The strong rhetoric of the meeting gave every indication that </p><p>the Senior General is still determined that the organization </p><p>will play a central role in the country\'s future. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  At its ninth annual general meeting the USDA declared </p><p>itself resolute to stand as a "consolidated national force" </p><p>and to shift from a "quantitative" to a "qualitative" power </p><p>by selecting the "cream" from among its members to serve as </p><p>leaders "in order to exist as long as the world does."  The </p><p>USDA general meeting is usually held on September 15, the </p><p>anniversary of the organization,s founding in 1993.  This </p><p>year the general meeting was postponed, reportedly due to </p><p>resistance from leaders who no longer wanted to participate. </p><p> </p><p>3.  According to local sources, members from 30 government </p><p>offices resisted becoming "full-time" USDA officials on the </p><p>grounds that they would lose their monthly government </p><p>salaries.  (USDA is composed of a </p><p>"voluntary" workforce).  After two months of discussions, the </p><p>Patron of the USDA, SPDC Senior General Than Shwe, apparently </p><p>overcame resistance by the newly "full-time" and unsalaried </p><p>officials and held a four-day annual general meeting </p><p>beginning on November 15. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Once the meeting went forward, key SPDC officers and </p><p>members fell in line and showed their support for the USDA </p><p>(and Than Shwe) by discussing development tasks for each of </p><p>the seven sectors based on the state\'s "five-year plan." </p><p>They also selected the most qualified of the 520 USDA </p><p>delegates in attendance, "the cream," to lead groups </p><p>addressing these development tasks.  The seven groups </p><p>addressed the following tasks: economics, administration, </p><p>organization, social, culture, education, and union </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Key SPDC officials who attended the meeting were Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe, USDA Central Executive Committee members </p><p>(composed of ten SPDC ministers), representatives of the </p><p>National Convention Convening Commission, the Office of the </p><p>President, the Attorney General, the Chief Justice, the </p><p>Auditor General, and Chairman of the Civil Service Selection </p><p>Training Board.  The 520 delegates were USDA representatives </p><p>of states, divisions, districts, and townships led by USDA </p><p>General Secretary U Than Aung.  The meeting was somewhat </p><p>similar in composition to a parliamentary convention, except </p><p>there were no elected officials. </p><p> </p><p>6. The USDA meeting concluded with its members pledging their </p><p>support for twelve objectives, three causes, and any </p><p>"instructions" from Senior General Than Shwe.  A contingent </p><p>of USDA members from high school sang the song "eternal </p><p>union." </p><p> </p><p>7.  Comment:  The annual meeting appears to have affirmed </p><p>that Senior General Than Shwe is continuing to move forward </p><p>with the SPDC\'s plan for managing the country,s affairs. </p><p>The strong rhetoric of the meeting gives every indication </p><p>that the Senior General is determined that the USDA play a </p><p>central role in the country,s future.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
