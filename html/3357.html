(C)  DURING A JULY 21 COURTESY CALL, SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF THE PEOPLES </p><p>ARCHBISHOP ROBERT SARAH OFFERED HIS VIEWS ON A WIDE RANGE OF </p><p>ISSUES FACING THE CHURCH IN AFRICA.  SARAH, FROM GUINEA, TOLD </p><p>US HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A BISHOPS\' CONFERENCE MEETING IN </p><p>ADDIS ABABA, WHERE THE BISHOPS HAD EXPRESSED STRONG CONCERN </p><p>AT THE CONTINUED PROBLEMS OF CONFLICT AND UNDER-DEVELOPMENT </p><p>IN EAST AFRICA AND SUDAN.  SARAH REPORTED THE SUDANESE </p><p>BISHOPS CHARACTERIZED THE SUDAN SITUATION AS GRIM, WITH </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS CONTINUING TO DE-HUMANIZE CHRISTIANS </p><p>AND OTHER NON-MUSLIM PEOPLES AS "DOGS, GOOD ONLY TO BE </p><p>BURNED."  HE SAID THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT IS BITTERLY </p><p>ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANS, AND HE DID NOT SEE ANY HOPE FOR </p><p>AN END TO THEIR HOSTILITY.  AS A RESULT, HE DIDN\'T SEE ANY </p><p>OTHER SOLUTION THAN SEPARATION OF SUDAN INTO TWO COUNTRIES </p><p>(NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL VATICAN POSITION, WHICH </p><p>SUPPORTS DIALOGUE AND RECONCILIATION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH </p><p>SUDAN.  FURTHERMORE, OUR CONVERSATION OCCURRED AFTER THE </p><p>AGREEMENT ON THE MACHAKOS PROTOCOL, YET SARAH DID NOT </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT PRESENTED A REAL SOLUTION END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  PICKING UP ON A THEME WE HAVE HEARD FREQUENTLY IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03638  01 OF 02  231756Z </p><p>PAST MONTHS, SARAH SEE A GROWING CHALLENGE TO THE CHURCH IN </p><p>AFRICA FROM ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS.  STARTING IN SUDAN, </p><p>YOUNGER, GULF-EDUCATED ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN SPREADING </p><p>MONEY THROUGHOUT SAHELIAN, EAST AND WEST AFRICA IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS.  THEIR MESSAGE IS THAT CHRISTIANITY IS A FOREIGN, </p><p>HIERARCHICAL, RELIGION AND THAT ISLAM IS AN INDIGENOUS </p><p>RELIGION MORE IN TUNE WITH AFRICAN TRADITIONS. SARAH SAID THE </p><p>CHURCH DOESN\'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO COMPETE WITH </p><p>THESE GULF-FINANCED FUNDAMENTALISTS IN PROVIDING CASH AND </p><p>SOCIAL SERVICES.  THE CHURCH\'S ONLY HOPE TO COUNTER THESE </p><p>INFLUENCES WAS THROUGH EDUCATION.  THE ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS HAVE MADE THEIR GREATEST GAINS AMONG THE </p><p>UNEDUCATED, BUT THE CHURCH\'S SCHOOLS, -- THOUGH UNDER-FUNDED </p><p>--  WOULD TRY TO HELP PEOPLE DISCERN THE DANGERS INHERENT IN </p><p>THE FUNDAMENTALIST PATH.  (COMMENT: IN PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS </p><p>WITH SARAH, HE, LIKE OUR OTHER INTERLOCUTORS OF AFRICAN </p><p>ORIGIN, HAD BEEN MUCH LESS CONCERNED WITH THE ISLAMIC </p><p>CHALLENGE.  HE AND THEY HAD FOCUSED ON BASIC PROBLEMS OF </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION.  HE NOW SEEMS TO SHARE </p><p>THE SAME CONCERNS AS HIS EUROPEAN CURIAL COLLEAGUES, WHO HAVE </p><p>BEEN AVIDLY RE-READING HUNTINGTON\'S CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS </p><p>SINCE 09/11.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  SARAH WAS QUICK TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE CHURCH\'S </p><p>CENTURIES LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH AFRICA\'S "INTEGRATED" </p><p>ISLAMIC COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN POSITIVE.  HE NOTED THE </p><p>BASICALLY GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES IN </p><p>MAJORITY-MUSLIM COUNTRIES SUCH AS SENEGAL AND CHAD. YET, EVEN </p><p>THERE HE FEARED FOR A FUTURE IN WHICH WAHABBI-IST ARAB </p><p>PROSELYTIZING COULD LEAD TO VIOLENT INTER-COMMUNAL CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03638  01 OF 02  231756Z </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>PROMOTING RECONCILIATION IN THE GREAT LAKES </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  RESPONDING TO A QUERY ABOUT HIS PREVIOUS FOCUS ON </p><p>RWANDAN EXCESSES IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO </p><p>(DRC), SARAH TOLD US HE HAD MET WITH RWANDAN PRESIDENT KAGAME </p><p>IN KIGALI IN LATE MAY.  THE ASSOCIATION OF BISHOPS\' </p><p>CONFERENCES IN CENTRAL AFRICA (ACEAC IN ITS FRENCH ACRONYM) </p><p>ORGANIZED A SERIES OF MEETINGS CULMINATING IN A PLENARY WITH </p><p>KAGAME IN LATE MAY.  THE ACEAC HAD DECIDED TO CONDUCT A </p><p>SERIES OF PUBLIC MEETINGS FOR THE  FIRST TIME IN YEARS IN THE </p><p>THREE COUNTRIES OF THE ASSOCIATION, TO DEMONSTRATE TO </p><p>CITIZENS OF THE GREAT LAKES CONFLICT ZONE THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>RECONCILIATION.  THEY DISCUSSED WITH KAGAME THE NEED FOR </p><p>ACTIVE CONFLICT RESOLUTION SO THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE </p><p>TO FACE THEIR MAJOR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES.  SARAH </p><p>REPORTED THAT KAGAME TOLD THE BISHOPS HE WAS READY TO </p><p>CONSIDER POSITIVELY THEIR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO PROCEED.  THE </p><p>BISHOPS ARE DRAFTING A DOCUMENT FOR KAGAME THAT SHOULD BE </p><p>READY BEFORE SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4286 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03638  02 OF 02  231511Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AMAD-00  EVG-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00 </p><p>      M-00     NSAE-00  IRM-00   EPAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   SAS-00 </p><p>        /002W </p><p>                  ------------------CF1984  231512Z /38 </p><p>P 231510Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>IGAD COLLECTIVE </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 003638 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR A/S KANSTEINER, EUR FOR DAS BRADTKE, EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KIRF, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: CHURCH IN AFRICA: CONFRONTING FUNDAMENTALISM; </p><p>PROMOTING RECONCILIATION, REFORM </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>REFORM IS A TWO-WAY STREET </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  TURNING THE DISCUSSION TO AFRICA\'S PROBLEMS OF </p><p>REFORM, DEVELOPMENT, AND THE HIV/AIDS CRISIS, SARAH </p><p>UNDERLINED THE CHURCH\'S FUNDAMENTAL VIEW THAT THE DEVELOPED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03638  02 OF 02  231511Z </p><p>WORLD MUST ALSO LOOK TO ITS OWN RESPONSIBILITIES.  ON </p><p>CORRUPTION,  FOR EXAMPLE, HE SAID AFRICAN OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>WORKING IN A "ZONA SPORCA" OR FILTHY ENVIRONMENT.  THEY </p><p>WOULDN\'T HAVE CORRUPT MONEY IF EQUALLY CORRUPT BUSINESSMEN </p><p>WEREN\'T GIVING IT TO THEM.  HE WAS ENCOURAGED TO HEAR OF U.S. </p><p>LAWS CONSTRAINING U.S. FIRMS FROM OFFERING BRIBES, AND AGREED </p><p>ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT THE WESTERN NATIONS </p><p>DEVELOPED SIMILAR PRACTICES.  THE CHURCH\'S OFFICIAL </p><p>PUBLICATIONS ON DEVELOPMENT CONDEMN CORRUPTION AND INSIST ON </p><p>REFORMS PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE IN RECIPIENT COUNTRIES. </p><p>BUT, ACCORDING TO THE DOCTRINE OF "SOCIAL GOODS," SARAH SAID </p><p>DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ALSO HAVE A DUTY TO LIVE IN SOLIDARITY </p><p>WITH THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  THIS MEANS HELPING THEM WITH </p><p>RELIEF ASSISTANCE AS NEEDED, HELPING THEM TO BUILD CAPACITY, </p><p>AND OFFERING THEM ACCESS TO DEVELOPED MARKETS AND FINANCE. </p><p>HE REGARDED SUPPORT FROM DEVELOPED COUNTRIES FOR INCREASED </p><p>EDUCATION AND TREATMENT AS ESSENTIAL TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS.  BUT </p><p>THE MOST URGENT TASK WAS, SARAH INSISTED, TO END THE </p><p>CONFLICTS CURRENTLY PLAGUING AFRICA, WITHOUT WHICH LITTLE </p><p>PROGRESS WOULD BE POSSIBLE. THE UNITED STATES "HAS A SPECIAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY, AS THE GREATEST POWER ON EARTH, TO STEP UP TO </p><p>THESE CHALLENGES AND LEAD THE DEVELOPED WORLD TO GREATER </p><p>SOLIDARITY WITH THE LESS FORTUNATE," HE CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLES </p><p>IS ONE OF THE HOLY SEE\'S OLDEST AND LARGEST CONGREGATIONS. </p><p>IT MANAGES THE CHURCH\'S MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES AROUND THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03638  02 OF 02  231511Z </p><p>WORLD IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN CHRISTIAN. </p><p> IT ENJOYS STRONG FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM DIOCESES IN THE </p><p>DEVELOPED WORLD, AND THUS IS ONE OF THE "RICHEST" DICASTRIES. </p><p> IN PAST CONVERSATIONS OUR INTERLOCUTORS HAVE FOCUSED WITH </p><p>EVIDENT PRIDE ON THE LARGE SOCIAL SERVICE PRESENCE OF THE </p><p>CHURCH IN AFRICA.  MORE THAN ONE HAS SAID THE CHURCH PROVIDES </p><p>MORE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (INCLUDING SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS) </p><p>IN AFRICA THAN DOES THE EUROPEAN UNION.  THE CURRENT </p><p>PRIORITIES LAID OUT BY SARAH -- CONFRONTING ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM, PROMOTION REGIONAL RECONCILIATION, AND </p><p>ENCOURAGING GOVERNMENTAL REFORM AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT -- ALL </p><p>TRACK CLOSELY WITH U.S. OBJECTIVES IN AFRICA.  THEY SUGGEST </p><p>THAT WE CAN SECURE IMPORTANT SUPPORT FOR U.S. POLICIES IN </p><p>THESE AREAS FROM THE HOLY SEE. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03638 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
