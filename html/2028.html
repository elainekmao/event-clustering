<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002511 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EPET, EFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: OBASANJO TO RELEASE 1.2 BILLION EXCESS CRUDE </p><p>REVENUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 2301 (B) LAGOS 2367 (C) ABUJA 997 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary: During a September 26 Council of State </p><p>meeting, President Obasanjo and state governors resolved </p><p>their highly publicized squabble over the fate of excess oil </p><p>revenues.  In exchange for the governors accepting a partial </p><p>allocation of 1.2 billion USD, Obasanjo agreed to eliminate </p><p>the Federal Wage and Salary Commission and the Pensions </p><p>Board.  These bodies had previously affected state budgets, </p><p>without the states\' consent or input.  The President </p><p>signalled this compromise in a September 18 letter to IMF </p><p>Managing Director Schroeder, arguing that political </p><p>exigencies in Nigeria required a limited disbursal of excess </p><p>revenues.  In the same letter he urged  the IMF not to allow </p><p>the SBA to lapse in October.  Obasanjo grappled with this </p><p>Gordian knot as best he could.  While the compromise makes an </p><p>extension of the SBA more complicated, it may be the best </p><p>deal Obasanjo could obtain politically:  the governors had </p><p>both the Constitution and much political weight on their </p><p>side.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Background </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Conflict between governors and the President over </p><p>excess oil revenue has heightened political tensions in Abuja </p><p>during the past six weeks.  The arcane revenue flow procedure </p><p>in Nigeria subject oil and non-oil revenues to a series of </p><p>"first deductions"  before being deposited into the </p><p>Federation Account.  Once in the account, this money is </p><p>disbursed monthly according to a preset formula: 48.5% to the </p><p>Federal Government, 24% to the states, 20% to local </p><p>governments, and 7.5% to a special funds account controlled </p><p>by the FG.  If revenues after first line charges exceed the </p><p>projected budgetary outlays for that month, the money is put </p><p>into the Excess Revenue and Set Asides Account.  (Ref C </p><p>provides more detail on how the Federation Account is funded </p><p>and its funds disbursed.)  In determining the overall amount </p><p>of the 2001 federal budget, planners used a 22 USD per barrel </p><p>oil price, with a set production estimate that has proven to </p><p>be overly-optimistic.  Revenues exceeding 22 USD per barrel </p><p>would then accrue to the Excess Proceeds Account.  Based on </p><p>actual production figures, excess revenue only accrues when </p><p>the oil price exceeds 25.5 USD per barrel--the rest is </p><p>consumed by planned 2001 spending. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  It is unclear what percentage of total annual excess </p><p>proceeds the 1.2 billion USD represents.  This amount will </p><p>likely comprise the lion\'s share of excess proceeds for the </p><p>year, given the recent drop in crude oil price below 25.5 USD </p><p>per barrel.  Obasanjo had blocked the transfer of excess </p><p>proceeds funds to the Federation Account since concluding the </p><p>current SBA with the IMF in August 2000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Economic arguments against releasing excess proceeds </p><p>were substantial.  The IMF, World Bank, and G-7 governments </p><p>had pressured President Obasanjo to restrain spending in </p><p>order to stabilize exchange and interest rates, to improve </p><p>the macro-economic environment, and to build forex reserves. </p><p>With the advent of value-for-money audits and budgetary due </p><p>process procedure on federal capital expenditures, the IMF </p><p>feels wasteful FG capital projects can be curtailed.  The IMF </p><p>opposes further dollops to state and local governments, not </p><p>only based on monetary policy, but also because effective </p><p>controls to prevent wasteful spending are lacking at the </p><p>state level.  Profligate spending at the state and local </p><p>levels would only undermine efforts to enhance FG fiscal </p><p>discipline, and would have a minatory effect on inflation and </p><p>the value of the naira.  (While some governors and LGA </p><p>chairmen are behaving responsibly with their revenue, the </p><p>majority are not.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The governors correctly asserted the Constitution </p><p>does not provide for special accounts outside of normal </p><p>budgetary mechanisms.  The Constitution states that all </p><p>revenue must go into the Federation Account to be divided </p><p>among federal, state and local governments.  The governors </p><p>also argued that the FG had been the most spend-thrift of all </p><p>levels of government and that they should not be penalized </p><p>for the toll the FG\'s intemperance has taken on the national </p><p>economy.  They point out that by creating discrete pots of </p><p>money, the President creates an environment that promotes </p><p>financial shenanigans.  Many foresee a large FG political </p><p>slush-fund for 2003, and are concerned that money will </p><p>continue to be "re-allocated." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Governors are also upset by what they see as unfunded </p><p>mandates from Abuja that have a dramatic affect on their </p><p>budgets but are established without consultating the state </p><p>capitals.  The new federal minimum wage and pension schemes </p><p>being their most compelling examples.  (COMMENT:  Some </p><p>governors have used their revenues wisely and responsibly. </p><p>Foremost among these in the North would be Makarfi (Kaduna), </p><p>Aleiro (Kebbi), Bafarawa (Sokoto) and Yar\'Adua (Katsina). </p><p>Peter Odili (Rivers) and Orji Kalu (Abia) are southern </p><p>governors who appear to be making good use of their </p><p>resources.  James Ibori of Delta State has embarked on </p><p>numerous costly building projects (such as office blocks and </p><p>stadiums), and there is no reason to think Delta\'s </p><p>contracting mechanisms are more transparent than those of the </p><p>FG; on the contrary, newspapers recently carried dozens of </p><p>full-page birthday wishes for Ibori -- paid by contractors </p><p>and Delta officials currying favor.  Meanwhile, Abubakar Audu </p><p>of Kogi State recently purchased a home in Potomac, Maryland, </p><p>for over $1.6 million with funds of unknown provenance; </p><p>Poster-boy for Sharia\' implementation Ahmed Sani Yerima of </p><p>Zamfara State apparently cannot account for much of the money </p><p>that has passed through his hands (septel).  Circumstances </p><p>are still worse at the local government level; observers </p><p>agree that the vast majority of local governments exist </p><p>primarily to divert revenue into the hands of government </p><p>officials and their cronies.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>------------ </p><p>Politics </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  Advocates on both sides of this dispute--the </p><p>Governors and the IMF--have bent the President\'s ear. </p><p>Obasanjo, of course, was not a disinterested arbiter. Because </p><p>of their evolution into an important independent political </p><p>force, the governors will be major power-brokers in the 2003 </p><p>election.  For many governors, the conflict over excess crude </p><p>proceeds has created more of a rift with the President than </p><p>any other issue.  It was a rift Obasanjo had to close.  On </p><p>the other hand, he had to tread lightly with the IMF for fear </p><p>of jeopardizing the SBA, and the interest moratorium agreed </p><p>to by the Paris Club. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  Due to this conundrum, President Obasanjo </p><p>vacillated between hard-line no (August) to yes (early </p><p>September) to "no more" (mid-September) to splitting the </p><p>difference at the September 26 Council of State meeting. </p><p>Acting as the governors\' spokesman during the meeting, </p><p>Governor Makarfi proposed the accepted compromise: if the FG </p><p>would abolish several national commissions that regulate </p><p>wages, pensions and employment, (no more unfunded mandates </p><p>from Abuja), the governors would accept distribution of </p><p>excess proceeds accruing during the first half of the year, </p><p>along with a promise that GSM and privatization money will be </p><p>placed in the Federation Account in due course.  Makarfi </p><p>believes the issue has been resolved, with everyone partly </p><p>satisfied except perhaps the IMF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  Comment: This compromise may have been the best </p><p>deal Obasanjo could achieve politically while also trying to </p><p>restrain spending to the extent possible.  Much money will go </p><p>to waste, and the concomitant influx of liquidity in the </p><p>economy likely will push inflation higher and the naira </p><p>lower.  That said, some governors are delivering tangible </p><p>benefits to their people, without borrowing against future </p><p>revenue, and this money will allow them to continue to do so. </p><p> As is so often the case here, the matrix of competing </p><p>interests has led to slowly-evolved yet imperfect solutions </p><p>that may be politically expedient but of questionable </p><p>economic value.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
