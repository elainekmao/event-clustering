<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000682 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS(FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY - 4/14 WASHINGTON CONFERENCE - </p><p>PART II (4/18-4/21) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. On April 14 Deputy Secretary Armitage hosted an </p><p>international conference on Sri Lanka for representatives </p><p>of 21 countries and 16 international organizations who </p><p>gathered to discuss Sri Lanka\'s peace negotiations, and </p><p>international assistance for the Island\'s development and </p><p>reconstruction.  Last week\'s Sri Lankan press coverage was </p><p>plentiful.  From 4/18 to 4/21 headlines slackened, but </p><p>post-holiday Sinhala weekender editorial coverage was </p><p>supportive. Three Sinhala papers editorialized, one </p><p>optimistic about the Washington Conference, two endorsing </p><p>Armitage\'s statements regarding the need for the LTTE to </p><p>change.  Major independent and opposition English Sunday </p><p>papers ran opinion pieces echoing similar themes. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Newspapers. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The week\'s earlier splashy headlines slowed, but </p><p>government owned Sinhala weekly Sunday SILUMINA weighed in </p><p>on its front page with "Richard Armitage\'s statement </p><p>commended."  Article excerpts: </p><p> "Many organizations have commended RA\'s statement which </p><p>said that LTTE should renounce terrorism if they want </p><p>peace...." </p><p> </p><p>"Chief Incumbent of Los Angeles Vihara Ven. Dr. </p><p>Dhammalankaara also said that LTTE should make use of this </p><p>opportunity..." </p><p> </p><p>"The Deputy State Sec. has said that LTTE is not happy </p><p>about their not being invited to Washington....US stance is </p><p>clear...." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Editorials. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>3. Under the headline "Let\'s make the most of the New Year </p><p>gift" the independent Sinhala SUNDAY LANKADEEPA stressed </p><p>the need to act promptly yet cautiously with the </p><p>international community in regards to peace and </p><p>reconstruction of the war-torn country.   Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"Unlike in other donor conferences, there have been no </p><p>critics.  Sri Lanka has never before been offered such a </p><p>gigantic sum.  Hats off to Minister Milinda Moragoda for </p><p>convincing the decision makers of twenty-five richest </p><p>countries and organizations in the world. " </p><p> </p><p>"Why did they agree?  They scrutinized the peace process </p><p>and contemplated the well-being of the disadvantaged </p><p>communities in Sri Lanka." </p><p> </p><p>"All ethnicities in the country suffered with terrorism and </p><p>wrong economic and social policies." </p><p> </p><p>"There have been external and internal factors toward </p><p>negative economic growth. For the country to recover we </p><p>need help of the international community.  But that alone </p><p>is not adequate." </p><p> </p><p>"We have a lot of displaced people wasting time in refugee </p><p>camps.  These people could be very productive and are an </p><p>important part of the country\'s labor force.  Hence they </p><p>should be appropriately deployed.  Resettlement is </p><p>essential with appropriate infrastructure.  Here comes </p><p>another important constraint - landmines.  Without de- </p><p>mining, resettlement and rehabilitation is impossible." </p><p> </p><p>"It\'s a Herculean task.  That\'s why we need foreign </p><p>assistance.  In Sri Lanka\'s development, the South is as </p><p>important as the North, so are the Tiger border villages. </p><p>Some say economic and social development should wait until </p><p>total peace is achieved - they don\'t trust LTTE.  They </p><p>think democracy should be brought in the North.  But that </p><p>can that be done with one stroke of the pen?" </p><p> </p><p>"We need to act fast." </p><p> </p><p>4. Under the headline "Armitage\'s speech on Tigers" the </p><p>independent Sinhala weekly LAKBIMA focused on the US\'s </p><p>continued ban on the LTTE.  It also noted that while it </p><p>disagreed with the US on the Iraq issue, "our anti-American </p><p>stance would by no means prevent us from endorsing American </p><p>opinion on the Tigers."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"Although Washington aid has been allocated to </p><p>rehabilitate North and East, Tigers were not invited to </p><p>Washington conference. That was despite their </p><p>strong expression of the need to attend same.  They were so </p><p>strong in their request said that they would not even </p><p>attend the Tokyo peace talks if they weren\'t invited to </p><p>Washington. But Washington did not care..." </p><p> </p><p>"Why-LTTE had been listed as a terrorist organization in </p><p>USA. If they would let the organization attend a high </p><p>profile conference officially they would be overlooking </p><p>that ban." </p><p>"That is the very reason why Tigers badly wanted to attend </p><p>the Washington conference. And that is why US was careful </p><p>enough not to let them in." </p><p> </p><p>"In his speech, RA said that any good reason was not </p><p>seen why they would lift the Tiger ban. He also said that </p><p>until the Tigers would show in word and deed their wish to </p><p>renounce terrorism that they would not do so." </p><p> </p><p>"If his statement was not clear to anyone - well he said </p><p>that they have still not renounced terrorism...." </p><p> </p><p>"The fact that the foreign policy of US has been largely </p><p>confusing to us in third world countries. " </p><p> </p><p>"We thoroughly criticised US in the Iraq issue. Even after </p><p>Iraq had collapsed, we remain in the same stance. That is </p><p>because we do not believe in intervening in the sovereignty </p><p>of an individual country. Our anti American stance then, </p><p>would by no means prevent us from endorsing American </p><p>opinion on the Tigers." </p><p> </p><p>"Information we receive is valid evidence as to LTTE is a </p><p>terrorist organisation and still they have not renounced </p><p>terrorism. Our news updates have been proving that. " </p><p> </p><p>"We should not forget that LTTE has entered truce and have </p><p>been maintaining that for so long. But we should not be </p><p>too quick to take the pet Tigers on to our lap to fondle." </p><p> </p><p>5. Under the headline "Can\'t LTTE change?" the independent </p><p>Sinhala SUNDAY DIVAINA supported Armitage\'s view of the </p><p>LTTE as a terrorist organization, and the need for it to </p><p>change "by word and deed."  It also pointed out that a </p><p>person of Armitage\'s status said what "no one" in Sri Lanka </p><p>will say, lest they be labeled anti-peace.   Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"We fully endorse the analysis of R Armitage... it is </p><p>extremely fair and right. It says.... America is watchful </p><p>on LTTE activities...should renounce terrorism....America </p><p>looks forward to seeing LTTE acting as a genuine political </p><p>party....But LTTE has not changed" </p><p> </p><p>"This US statement have disappointed tigers and their hero- </p><p>worshippers like SLMM and certain NGOs... Its only Richard </p><p>Armitage of America but no small fry could make such a </p><p>statement....if somebody else made this statement he would </p><p>be labeled as an anti peace person... no one would dare to </p><p>say that RA spoke as per tips of the extremists in the </p><p>South...and moreover, RA is not naive" </p><p> </p><p>"Our stance is same..MOU has had serious </p><p>violations...killings, arms smuggling, abductions...height </p><p>of terrorism" </p><p> </p><p>"RA is quite right...Do tiger leaders ever want a change? </p><p>However, US is still quite cool about LTTE </p><p>leader...Although Bush sees Saddam Hussein as a terrorist, </p><p>he does not regard Prabhakaran as one...It\'s Prabha\'s luck </p><p>and our bad luck." </p><p> </p><p>"It is important that the US attitude about tigers should </p><p>be similar to our leaders view on tigers...Does LTTE want </p><p>to be changed? What is AB\'s or VP\'s reply to that? It </p><p>should be by word and deed" </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
