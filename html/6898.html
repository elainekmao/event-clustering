Progress toward peace talks between the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) and Maoist insurgents remains stalled during </p><p>King Gyanendra\'s two-week visit to India.  In the interim, </p><p>Maoist and GON representatives are accusing one another of </p><p>failing to create a "conducive atmosphere" for talks, and </p><p>violating the code of conduct agreed upon during the </p><p>ceasefire (Ref A).  Police sources said that Maoist </p><p>idealogue, Dr. Baburam Bhattarai arrived in Kathmandu on the </p><p>afternoon of March 28.  A Maoist leader in Sindhuli District </p><p>declared on March 23 that the Maoists were not involved in </p><p>the brutal murders of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, Inspector </p><p>General of the Armed Police Force, his wife and bodyguard </p><p>(Ref B), directly contradicting previous statements by Dr. </p><p>Baburam Bhattarai that Maoists had accepted responsibility </p><p>for the murders.  In spite of the disagreements, </p><p>reconstruction efforts have gotten underway with the repair </p><p>of telephone lines destroyed in past Maoist attacks.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST LEADER ARRIVES IN KATHMANDU </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Police sources said that Maoist idealogue Dr. Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai arrived in Kathmandu on March 28.  Bhattarai was </p><p>reportedly meeting with a pro-Maoist lawyer in downtown </p><p>Kathmandu late afternoon. </p><p> </p><p>BLAME GAME OVER PEACE TALKS STANDSTILL </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  As expected, progress toward possible peace talks </p><p>between Maoist insurgents and the Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>remains stalled during King Gyanendra\'s March 18-30 visit to </p><p>India.  In the interim, the two sides have traded charges </p><p>that the other is impeding progress by failing to create a </p><p>"conducive atmosphere" for eventual dialogue.  Narayan Singh </p><p>Pun, Minister of Physical Planning and Works and government- </p><p>appointed coordinator for the peace talks, accused the </p><p>Maoists on March 23 of delaying the peace talks by </p><p>continually increasing their demands.  Pun said the </p><p>insurgents have issued new demands, such as the immediate </p><p>release of all Maoist detainees from GON custody, as </p><p>preconditions for peace talks, refusing to even sit for </p><p>"goodwill talks" unless their demands are met. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Maoist leader Prachanda and Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, the </p><p>chief negotiator for the Maoists, repeated charges that the </p><p>GON is not moving quickly enough toward peace talks, and has </p><p>failed to follow through on its putative promises to release </p><p>all prisoners.  Prachanda also criticized the GON for its </p><p>delay in forming a negotiating team two months after the </p><p>ceasefire was mutually declared, and said that these </p><p>"irresponsible activities" were raising doubt and suspicion </p><p>instead of building confidence and trust.  Krishna Bahadur </p><p>Mahara, member of the Maoist negotiating team, said talks </p><p>would begin once the GON releases all prisoners and </p><p>withdraws the pending criminal cases against five party </p><p>leaders, including Prachanda and Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, the </p><p>two most senior Maoist leaders.  (Note:  The GON has </p><p>released from detention over thirty lower-ranking Maoist </p><p>cadres this week, and has released other detainees as well </p><p>since the announcement of the ceasefire.  Minister Pun has </p><p>explained publicly that prisoners cannot be released without </p><p>following proper legal procedures, and private lawsuits </p><p>against Maoist leaders cannot be waived by the GON.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>ACCUSATIONS OF CODE OF CONDUCT VIOLATIONS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  Minister Pun told an audience of human rights activists </p><p>on March 24 that the GON had received reports of seventy to </p><p>eighty incidents of ceasefire violations by the Maoists, </p><p>amounting to what he termed "armed terror."  Pun said the </p><p>reports detail continued extortion attempts; looting; </p><p>abduction of children, women and several policemen; </p><p>physical assault on civilians; and the murders of a school </p><p>teacher and a Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (CPN-UML) worker.  Maoist spokesman Mahara denied </p><p>the reports and issued counter-charges accusing the GON of </p><p>violating the code of conduct by performing illegal searches </p><p>and arrests, banning organized meetings, and sending army </p><p>personnel, dressed as civilians, to Maoist programs in order </p><p>to spy on Maoist cadres.  A Maoist district leader in </p><p>Lalitpur allegedly declared that if the GON continued with </p><p>such activities, Maoists would soon retaliate with force. </p><p>Dipak Gurung, Spokesman for the Royal Nepal Army (RNA), </p><p>responded that maintaining law and order is not violating </p><p>the code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST LEADER LIES ABOUT IGP\'S MURDER </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  A Maoist leader in Sindhuli District participating in a </p><p>roundtable conference on March 23 denied that the Maoists </p><p>were involved in the brutal murders of Krishna Mohan </p><p>Shrestha, Inspector General of the Armed Police Force, his </p><p>wife and bodyguard (Ref B).  His comments directly </p><p>contradicted Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, senior-level Maoist </p><p>leader and head of the Maoist negotiating team, who </p><p>reportedly said his party accepted responsibility for the </p><p>murders.  Investigations into the killings concluded that </p><p>they were part of a strategy of a special task force within </p><p>the Maoist party to kill political, security and </p><p>administrative chiefs (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS UNDERWAY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Telephone service has been restored throughout the far- </p><p>western regions, after being destroyed by Maoists during the </p><p>insurgency.  In Tehrathum District alone, Maoist attacks </p><p>damaged close to thirty telephone lines, and in Dipayal </p><p>District the insurgents severely disrupted phone service by </p><p>destroying all the solar panels, antennas, wires and </p><p>batteries.  Many of the districts have been without </p><p>telephone service for over a year. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
