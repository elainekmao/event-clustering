<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000494 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EB/TPP/BTA/EWH - MKEHOE </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR ANDREW STEPHENS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/IA - A/S SHIRZAD AND ITA - JSPETRINI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EIND, ECON, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: STEEL - U.S. GOALS FOR FEBRUARY 24-25 OECD </p><p>DISCIPLINES STUDY GROUP </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 45598 </p><p> </p><p>1. EconCouns passed reftel talking points to Department of </p><p>Foreign Affairs and International Trade Deputy Director for </p><p>Trade Remedies Mike Robertson on February 20. Robertson noted </p><p>significant overlap between the U.S. goals and the GOC\'s </p><p>objectives for the February 24-25 Study Group meeting.  He </p><p>said Canada and the United States had exchanged papers and he </p><p>had seen several other countries\' comments as well. </p><p> </p><p>2. Based on the positive outcome of the December meeting and </p><p>the good work he had seen since, Robertson was optimistic </p><p>that next week\'s meeting would make substantial progress </p><p>toward effective discipline of steel subsidies.  He did note </p><p>a couple of areas that, in Canada\'s view, were not ripe for </p><p>discussion.  For example, said Robertson, Canada will not </p><p>take a position on enforcement mechanisms until the GOC is </p><p>clear on what is being enforced.  Similarly, Robertson said </p><p>there was no way of knowing what kind of special and </p><p>differential (S&D) treatment should be offered and to whom </p><p>without knowing the range of agreed disciplines to which the </p><p>non-S&D participants were willing to submit. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Robertson welcomed the expression of U.S. gratitude for </p><p>effective NAFTA solidarity at the December meeting, agreeing </p><p>that it had been a factor in increasing the momentum of the </p><p>OECD effort.  He also praised the hard work of the OECD </p><p>secretariat in pressing participants for written comment. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
