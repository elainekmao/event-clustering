<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000760 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: LEADERSHIP IN THE ORTHODOX WORLD: THE ECUMENICAL </p><p>PATRIARCH AND RUSSIAN COMPETITION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David L. Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and ( d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Though divided among many national churches, </p><p>all Orthodox leaders except the Russian Orthodox recognize </p><p>the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul, Bartholomew II, as </p><p>first among equals.  Located in "The Second Rome," the </p><p>Ecumenical Patriarch traces a line of succession back to St. </p><p>Andrew and, later, the conversion of Emperor Constantine. </p><p>However, Alexei II, Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, </p><p>may be making a play for preeminence within Orthodoxy.  In a </p><p>recent conversation, Metropolitan Meliton confirmed the </p><p>competitive atmosphere and the Ecumenical Patriarchate\'s </p><p>animosity toward more recent Russian machinations.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>How Many Romes Are There? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Being a student of Orthodox power politics is a little </p><p>bit like watching a prize fight in slow-motion.  Jabs and </p><p>swings come only rarely, and there are plenty of breaks.  The </p><p>prize in question in this case is not a summit of religious </p><p>authority, as with the Pope in Roman Catholicism, but a nod </p><p>of pre-eminence from other Orthodox leaders.  With this nod </p><p>comes a certain ability to set the tone of discussions </p><p>between Orthodoxy and the outside world, especially Western </p><p>Christianity.  However, changes come only slowly, and church </p><p>concerns revolve around events in the distant future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) One of the central pillars of support to the </p><p>Ecumenical Patriarch\'s claim to ecumenical status is </p><p>location.  As "Patriarch of Constantinople and New Rome," he </p><p>can trace authority back to the Apostle Andrew and leadership </p><p>of the city where Christianity first became legalized within </p><p>the Roman Empire under Constantine, and later the state </p><p>religion.  Demography and Turkish law are working against the </p><p>Ecumenical Patriarch\'s status in "The Second Rome," however. </p><p>The Greek Orthodox citizens of Turkey (from whom a new </p><p>Patriarch must be chosen) now number only 3,000.  For the </p><p>Patriarchate to continue beyond one or two more patriarchs </p><p>after Bartholomew II, Turkish law regarding Lausanne Treaty </p><p>minorities will have to change, allowing leadership by </p><p>non-Turkish citizens.  This seems unlikely to happen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) There is a Third Rome, though.  Moscow claims that, </p><p>prior to the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, the torch was </p><p>passed to it to take up leadership within Orthodoxy, when the </p><p>tsar was given the Cap of Monomakh.  Tenuous though the claim </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>may be, it allowed the Romanov tsars to claim the title of </p><p>"Protector of the Orthodox Faith," a position which played </p><p>into Russia\'s involvement in the First World War, and the </p><p>Romanov dynasty\'s demise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Don\'t Write to My Bishop! </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The most recent round of maneuvering began with a </p><p>letter from Russian Patriarch Alexei II to several Orthodox </p><p>leaders in Western Europe.  Under Orthodox canon law, a </p><p>Patriarchof a national church is confined to communicating </p><p>directly on </p><p> with bishops and priests under his on </p><p>authority.  The Ecumenical Patriarchate provided poloff with </p><p>a letter from Alexei to, among others, "His Grace, the Right </p><p>Reverend Gabriel, Bishop of Komansk, Locum Tenens of the </p><p>Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox Parishes in Western Europe," </p><p>and four other church leaders the Ecumenical Patriarch claims </p><p>as his own. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In the letter, Alexei lays out the reasons that he </p><p>does not consider the Russian Orthodox Church in Western </p><p>Europe to be subordinate to Constantinople.  He cites a 1931 </p><p>letter from Photius, then Ecumenical Patriarch, who he argues </p><p>foresaw only temporary subordination of the Russian Exarchate </p><p>in Western Europe to Constantinople "until, God willing, </p><p>unity and the unbroken image of the Holy Sister Russian </p><p>Church are restored."  Alexei now argues that that time has </p><p>come. </p><p>7. (C) Moreover, Alexei\'s letter lays out a new proposal for </p><p>a single Metropolitan for the Russian Church in Western </p><p>Europe.  Unlike the current Orthodox leaders in Western </p><p>Europe, who are appointed by the Ecumenical Patriarch, he </p><p>argues that local leaders should be elected from among local </p><p>clergy, and confirmed by Moscow.  Thus, Alexei holds out the </p><p>prospect of greater autonomy, tied to his own authority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>More Churches, Please </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On a recent trip to Moscow, Metropolitan Meliton of </p><p>Philadelphia (Chief Secretary of the Holy Synod) said the </p><p>Russians made a further request: four churches in Istanbul. </p><p>Currently, the Russian Orthodox Church provides priests to </p><p>serve in a church owned by the Ecumenical Patriarchate. </p><p>However, they argue, their need has grown, and more churches </p><p>are required.  Rather than just working as guests on </p><p>Ecumenical Patriarchate property, they have requested that </p><p>ownership be transferred to them.  Meliton said he denied </p><p>their request, but offered to expand the number of Russian </p><p>Orthodox priests allowed to serve the flock in Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>"Political, Not Spiritual" </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Meliton said that in the wake of the collapse of </p><p>communism, the Russian Orthodox Church was badly discredited, </p><p>not least among their Orthodox co-religionists.  While he </p><p>recalls in the past working with Russian prelates who were </p><p>focused on spiritual concerns, he feels that picture has </p><p>changed.  Now, he says, "Alexei and his bishops are all </p><p>former KGB informants, who still work closely with the FSB </p><p>and are far more political than spiritual in nature." </p><p>Meliton says he and the Patriarchate view Russian Orthodoxy </p><p>with great suspicion, and believe that it is deeply entangled </p><p>in the political needs of the Russian state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Although not unheard of, it is rare for Turkish </p><p>political analysts or commentators to grasp that GOT </p><p>acceptance of the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate in </p><p>Istanbul and facilitation of the Patriarchate\'s ability to </p><p>continue would accrue foreign policy benefits to Turkey.  In </p><p>this regard we will continue to pay close attention to the </p><p>attitude toward the Patriarchate of Turkish "Eurasianists" -- </p><p>i.e., those in the military, MFA, think tanks and business </p><p>world who advocate closer ties to Russia as an alternative to </p><p>Turkey\'s U.S/EU orientation. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
