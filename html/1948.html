<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002256 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/07/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SU, SL, ZI, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: CONFLICT RESOLUTION - "AFRICAN-STYLE" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 153144 </p><p>     B. STATE 153894 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 2253 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: CDA, accompanied by PolMilOff, called on the </p><p>Special Presidential Envoy for Conflict Resolution, </p><p>Ambassador Raph Uwechue, to discuss Sudan developments (Refs </p><p>A and B).  Uwechue welcomed the appointment of Senator </p><p>Danforth as a signal of U.S. interest in Sudan and Africa. </p><p>He described African conflict resolution as based on emotion </p><p>rather than calculation, and described President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>most recent efforts in Sierra Leone as an example.  Finally, </p><p>he gave his insights into Zimbabwe, arguing for the need to </p><p>strike a balance between competing interests.  Bio </p><p>information in paras 5-8.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) SPECIAL ENVOY APPOINTMENT: Uwechue stated that the </p><p>appointment of Senator Danforth was welcome and an indication </p><p>of "how seriously the Administration takes Sudan."  He also </p><p>noted that Nigeria was interested to work with the U.S. to </p><p>resolve conflicts generally, and that with so much in common, </p><p>the two countries could build greater understanding. </p><p>Moreover, in describing countries as mammals, "the U.S. is </p><p>like an elephant," Uwechue said, "it carries a lot of weight </p><p>and leaves a big footprint."  The U.S. could make a dent, </p><p>Uwechue opined, when others could not do so.  However, such </p><p>weight imposed the responsibility to step carefully. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CONFLICT RESOLUTION AFRICA-STYLE: Uwechue described </p><p>African conflict resolution as based on emotion, rather than, </p><p>pointing to his head and smiling, "your computers."  He </p><p>elaborated that with Africans, once you make a personal </p><p>connection, you can ask of them almost anything, and "sort </p><p>out the details later."  Turning to Sierra Leone, Uwechue </p><p>briefly discussed his trip with President Obasanjo on </p><p>September 3, which he described as historic, particularly </p><p>noting the meeting of Presidents Kabbah (with his FM), </p><p>Obasanjo (with Uwechue) and Konare (with his MOJ) with four </p><p>RUF leaders (he named Sessay and Massoquoi) in Kono.  He said </p><p>the GOSL had agreed to open a RUF liaison office in Freetown </p><p>to "keep the communication lines open." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ZIMBABWE: Uwechue opined that any solution on Zimbabwe </p><p>would have to strike a balance between the claims of both </p><p>sides.  He noted that the "settlers" were not colonialists </p><p>but Zimbabweans, and that they were critical to the </p><p>Zimbabwean economy.  However, black Zimbabwean farmers wanted </p><p>access to lands once held by their ancestors.  Uwechue </p><p>pointed to his arm and noted that Americans, whether of </p><p>African descent and with dark skin or of Scandinavian descent </p><p>and with white skin, were all Americans.  Likewise, he </p><p>stated, Africans, whether the Arabs living in North Africa, </p><p>whites in southern Africa, or black Africans, were all </p><p>Africans.  for reporting on the Abuja Commonwealth </p><p>Ministerial, see Ref C (notal). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) BIOGRAPHICAL INFO: Ambassador Raphael Uwechue was </p><p>born in 1935 at Ogwashi-Uku, Delta State.
