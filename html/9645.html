<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001491 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC NOMINEES HARASSED, PREVENTED FROM FORWARDING </p><p>THEIR CANDIDACIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1475 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On July 21, about 20 cities across Zimbabwe opened </p><p>nominations for candidates to stand in mayoral and urban </p><p>council elections to be held on August 30-31, but at least 20 </p><p>would-be opposition candidates were prevented from </p><p>registering by ruling party youths.  This occurred before the </p><p>MDC received assurances from ZANU-PF that they would be </p><p>allowed to campaign freely in exchange for Tsvangirai and MDC </p><p>MPs\' agreement not to boycott Mugabe\'s speech at the opening </p><p>of parliament on July 22 (Ref).  ZANU-PF officials have </p><p>reportedly promised to re-open the affected nomination </p><p>courts, and, if that happens and the MDC is allowed to </p><p>campaign freely, this could dramatically change the tenor of </p><p>these elections for the better, as compared to every other </p><p>election in the past two years, which has been tainted by </p><p>intimidation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On July 21, nominations were held in about 20 cities </p><p>across Zimbabwe for candidates to stand in mayoral and urban </p><p>council elections to be held August 30-31. </p><p> </p><p>Candidacies Prevented </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) According to the independent Daily News at least 20 </p><p>opposition candidates in Chegutu, Bindura, Marondera, Rusape </p><p>and Karoi were forcefully prevented from registering their </p><p>candidacies.  According to the government-owned The Herald, </p><p>ZANU-PF candidates subsequently won 44 council seats and one </p><p>mayoral seat uncontested.  The ruling party did, however, </p><p>fail to field two council candidates in Bulawayo--those seats </p><p>fell to the opposition MDC. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In Chegutu, Amani Trust (a local human rights NGO) </p><p>reported that ruling party youths beat 11 people in the </p><p>vicinity of the nomination court.  The Daily News reported </p><p>that MDC council candidate Albert Ndlovu suffered severe neck </p><p>injuries when he was attacked by ruling party youths who </p><p>manned the gate at Chegutu Town House (where nominations were </p><p>to take place.) The Daily News reported that in Chegutu, 10 </p><p>ZANU-PF council candidates subsequently won their seats </p><p>unopposed. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Daily News reported that In Karoi, two MDC </p><p>candidates were taken to hospital for treatment of wounds </p><p>inflicted by ruling party youths. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) In Bindura and Chegutu ZANU-PF youths set up makeshift </p><p>roadblocks and prevented MDC candidate Fred Chimbiri from </p><p>reaching the nomination court. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Amani Trust also reported that ruling party youth </p><p>militia members beat 4 people in Marondera near the </p><p>nomination site on July 21. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The MDC reported that they failed to field all their </p><p>candidates in Rusape, Bindura, Karoi, Chegutu, and Marondera </p><p>because of violence. </p><p> </p><p>Campaign of Intimidation </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In the weeks leading up to the nominations, the MDC </p><p>reported that ZANU-PF youths harassed and threatened one of </p><p>their council candidates in Marondera, Deliquah Nicholas </p><p>Simon Musiwa, and his family.  According to the MDC, ZANU-PF </p><p>youths abducted Musiwa\'s wife Sarudzai and their 18-yr old </p><p>son Peter on June 5, held them overnight, and assaulted them </p><p>at the ZANU-PF Mashonaland East Provincial Headquarters.  On </p><p>June 6 Musiwa was detained by police for 2 days and was </p><p>reportedly assaulted by Criminal Investigations Department </p><p>(CID) Inspector Manjengwa and four other police officers. </p><p>Musiwa subsequently sought medical care at Masvingo General </p><p>Hospital. </p><p> </p><p>Some Cities Unaffected </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) According to the Daily News, both parties fielded a </p><p>full compliment of council candidates in Masvingo, Gweru and </p><p>Redcliff.  In Kwekwe, Redcliff, Gweru, and Mutare, both </p><p>parties also fielded a full compliment of mayoral candidates. </p><p> </p><p>Broken Promise? </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In a conversation with the Ambassador on July 22, MDC </p><p>President Morgan Tsvangirai said that his party had received </p><p>assurances from ZANU-PF that they would be allowed to </p><p>campaign freely for the upcoming mayoral, urban council, and </p><p>parliamentary by-elections.  This was in exchange for </p><p>Tsvangirai and MDC MPs\' agreement not to boycott Mugabe\'s </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>speech at the opening of parliament on July 22 (Ref).  The </p><p>agreement came too late for ZANU-PF to notify their officials </p><p>in rural areas to stand down, and the intimidation campaign </p><p>went ahead.  Tsvangirai was subsequently told that the </p><p>nomination courts would be re-opened in the affected areas. </p><p>We have not been unable to confirm with either the GOZ or MDC </p><p>officials that this might actually take place. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) In addition to mayoral and urban council elections, </p><p>parliamentary by-elections will also be held for a Harare </p><p>Central seat vacated by MDC MP Michael Auret who is stepping </p><p>down due to illness, and a Makonde, Mashonaland West, seat </p><p>vacated by the death of ZANU-PF MP and Minister of Higher and </p><p>Tertiary Education, Swithun Mombeshora. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Perceptions are important in the early stages of any </p><p>election.  The ruling party has gained 44 out of 269 council </p><p>seats already, and one mayoral seat - 16% of the total seats </p><p>being contested.  This is a significant headstart, and it </p><p>appears the harassment campaign sent a strong signal early </p><p>that MDC candidates will face an uphill battle against the </p><p>usual intimidation tactics if they try to campaign openly. </p><p>The council terms are for 5-years, so this is the first time </p><p>the MDC has contested these seats.  If the GOZ re-opens the </p><p>affected nomination courts, and allows the MDC to campaign </p><p>openly, they could dramatically change the tenor of these </p><p>elections for the better as compared to every election in the </p><p>past two years, which has been marred by intimidation. </p><p>Whether ZANU-PF is willing to re-open the nomination process </p><p>where it was blocked will be a significant test of ZANU-PF </p><p>goodwill and readiness to pay more than lip-service to calls </p><p>for national dialogue.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
