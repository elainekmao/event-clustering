<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001525 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/EX, CA, PA, INR AND S/ES/O/CMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, CASC, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY AMMAN TO FORM CRISIS LIAISON UNIT IF/WHEN </p><p>HOSTILITIES COMMENCE </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) In the event that war begins with Iraq, Embassy </p><p>Amman will stand up a Crisis Liaison Unit (CLU) that will </p><p>serve as the Embassy\'s central point of contact/clearinghouse </p><p>for DoS inquiries on all crisis-related issues.  Inquiries </p><p>from the Ops Center and associated DoS Task Forces should </p><p>come through the CLU and -- similarly -- Embassy-generated </p><p>responses should be sent out via the CLU.  The goal is to </p><p>ensure that, as issues arise, we provide one definitive </p><p>answer to the Department (rather than multiple, possibly </p><p>conflicting, answers from different offices).  As currently </p><p>envisioned, the CLU will be staffed 24-hours a day by three </p><p>officers and one OMS per shift during the first few days </p><p>after war begins.  Following this initial period, we will </p><p>assess staffing levels and -- depending on the actual flow of </p><p>work -- make necessary adjustments. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  When contacted by the Department on a particular </p><p>subject, the CLU will contact the Mission office that is </p><p>expert in that issue.  Once it has gathered the information </p><p>necessary to respond to the inquiry, the CLU will communicate </p><p>back to the Department -- either orally on an open or STU-III </p><p>line, or in writing via e-mail (SBU or Classified) or SITREP. </p><p> The CLU will draft regular SITREPS to the Department </p><p>summarizing all important crisis-related developments and </p><p>also keep a log of its actions. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) It is important to be clear that public or press </p><p>inquiries should not be directed to the CLU during regular </p><p>working hours.  The Embassy Switchboard Operator will be </p><p>instructed to direct such inquires to the Consular Section </p><p>(for Consular matters), RSO (for Security questions) and PA </p><p>(Press).  If such calls come into the CLU during regular </p><p>hours, they will be directed to the appropriate office. </p><p>Outside of regular Embassy hours, all crisis-related calls </p><p>will be directed to the CLU. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>CLU PHONE/FAX NUMBERS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Department should utilize the following numbers </p><p>when contacting the CLU. </p><p> </p><p>STU-III:  962-6-592-7740 </p><p> </p><p>Unclassified lines: 962-6-592-0101 ext. 2366 or ext 2599 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Unclassified FAX: 962-6-592-0159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>E-Mail </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  The CLU has a dedicated E-mail Address on both the </p><p>Classified and SBU computer Systems.  On the classified </p><p>system, the address that appears in the Global Address List </p><p>is "Amman-MSX-Crisis Liaison Unit."  On the Unclassified </p><p>system, the CLU\'s address in the Global Address List is </p><p>"Amman Crisis Liaison Unit." </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Please note that we will only start using the above </p><p>listed phone numbers and e-mail addresses if/when war </p><p>commences and the CLU is stood up. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
