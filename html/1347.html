(C) SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR MCDONALD SUPPORTED A DINNER </p><p>HOSTED BY MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE </p><p>NKOSANA MOYO NOVEMBER 7 AIMED AT GETTING ZANU-PF AND MDC </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS TALKING TO EACH OTHER.  AMONG THE </p><p>GUESTS WERE TWO MDC AND TWO ZANU-PF MPS.  THE ATMOSPHERE </p><p>WAS CORDIAL AND BOTH SIDES SPOKE FRANKLY OF THEIR OWN </p><p>DELEGATIONS\' FAILINGS IN PARLIAMENT.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR, ALONG WITH THE AMBASSADORS FROM </p><p>GERMANY, AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND FRANCE, SUPPORTED A </p><p>DINNER HOSTED BY MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TRADE NKOSANA MOYO AT MOYO\'S RESIDENCE NOVEMBER 7.

(C) THE OBJECTIVE OF THE DINNER WAS TO BEGIN A </p><p>CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE ZANU-PF AND MDC </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS, WHO HAVE SHOWN FEW SIGNS OF </p><p>COOPERATION IN THIS NEW SESSION OF PARLIAMENT.  THE </p><p>VITRIOL HAS REACHED A NEW LEVEL FOLLOWING THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF THE MDC\'S PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT </p><p>MOTION (REF B).  THE ATMOSPHERE WAS CORDIAL AND THE </p><p>DISCUSSION CENTERED AROUND PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE </p><p>BEFORE TURNING TO INDIVIDUAL PARLIAMENTARIANS.

(COMMENT: </p><p>GEZI, THE FORMER MASHONALAND CENTRAL GOVERNOR, </p><p>PERSONALLY AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY DIRECTED THE CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE IN HIS PROVINCE.  KASUKUWERE ALSO </p><p>IS REPORTED TO HAVE DIRTY HANDS FROM THE PRE-ELECTION </p><p>PERIOD [REF A] END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AS PART OF HIS AGENDA FOR THE DINNER, MINISTER </p><p>MOYO SOUGHT TO BUILD BI-PARTISAN SUPPORT FOR LAYING THE </p><p>POLICY GROUNDWORK TO QUALIFY FOR AFRICAN GROWTH AND </p><p>OPPORTUNITY ACT (AGOA) CONCESSIONS.  THE AUSTRALIAN HIGH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06318  091550Z </p><p>COMMISSIONER REPORTED TO DCM THAT THE MAIN INITIATIVE IN </p><p>THE CARDS WAS A POSSIBLE JOINT TRIP TO WASHINGTON TO </p><p>PLEAD ZIMBABWE\'S CASE.  SUBSEQUENTLY, MINISTER MOYO </p><p>BROACHED THE POSSIBLE TRIP TO THE AMBASSADOR, WHO </p><p>COUNSELED THAT THE EFFORT NOT BE UNDERTAKEN UNTIL LATE </p><p>FEBRUARY OR MARCH 2001 WHEN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IS IN </p><p>PLACE.  HE ALSO ADVISED THE MINISTER TO MANAGE </p><p>EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THE AGOA DECISION RELATED TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS NOT LIKELY TO BE REVERSED OR OVERTURNED </p><p>SOON. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH NO BREAKTHROUGHS WERE SEEN AT </p><p>THIS DINNER, AS EXPECTED, WE WERE PLEASED TO SEE BOTH </p><p>SIDES ENGAGED IN A CORDIAL AND FRANK DISCUSSION. </p><p>WELSHMAN NCUBE, AN MDC MODERATE, IS WELL THOUGHT OF BY </p><p>BOTH SIDES AND COULD BE A KEY PERSON IN FUTURE BI- </p><p>PARTISAN MEETINGS.  MINISTER MOYO IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR AND CLEARLY WANTS ZIMBABWE TO QUALIFY FOR </p><p>AGOA.  THE AMBASSADOR ENVISIONS A SERIES OF THESE LESS </p><p>FORMAL, CONFIDENCE-BUILDING GATHERINGS, AND WILL BE </p><p>WORKING WITH HIS DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES TO JUMPSTART THE </p><p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN ZANU-PF AND MDC BEFORE THE TENSION </p><p>BETWEEN THEM COMES TO BLOWS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
