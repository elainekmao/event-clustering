<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 002817 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; NEA/IAI; NEA/ENA; NEA/NGA; SA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02817  01 OF 03  290455Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, KPAL, VM, IZ, IS, PK, SY, TU, AF, LY </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM AND THE MIDDLE EAST, AND BEYOND: </p><p>--         TRANSFORMING TRADITIONAL FRIENDSHIPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.  HANOI 2139     B.  HANOI 2658 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  DESPITE A DESIRE TO PRESERVE </p><p>"TRADITIONAL FRIENDSHIPS" IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE LARGER </p><p>THRUST OF THE GVN\'S REGIONAL AND GLOBAL FOREIGN POLICY OVER </p><p>THE PAST DECADE HAS BEEN TO BROADEN ITS BASE OF DIPLOMATIC </p><p>PARTNERS AND TO PUT A GREATER EMPHASIS ON BUSINESS TIES. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, VIETNAM SUPPORTS PALESTINIAN ASPIRATIONS FOR </p><p>STATEHOOD, BUT ALSO MAINTAINS "NORMAL RELATIONS" WITH </p><p>ISRAEL, ALBEIT WITHOUT AN EMBASSY THERE.  THE GVN HAS NO </p><p>DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH THE TALIBAN AND WORRIES ABOUT CIVILIAN </p><p>CASUALTIES IN THE CURRENT US-LED MILITARY OPERATIONS.  ITS </p><p>MAJOR COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP IN THE REGION REMAINS WITH </p><p>IRAQ.  RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN ARE GROWING INCREMENTALLY. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>PALESTINE/ISRAEL: WE CAN DEAL WITH BOTH </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) DOAN NGOC BOI, DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE </p><p>MFA\'S WEST ASIA AND AFRICA DEPARTMENT, DESCRIBED THE </p><p>PALESTINE AUTHORITY AS AN IMPORTANT "TRADITIONAL FRIEND" OF </p><p>VIETNAM, WHICH STRONGLY SUPPORTS PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD.  IN </p><p>HIS VIEW, AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE "WOULD SOLVE MANY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02817  01 OF 03  290455Z </p><p>PROBLEMS" IN THE AREA.  BOI NOTED THAT PRESIDENT ARAFAT </p><p>VISITS VIETNAM REGULARLY (REF A) AND WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE </p><p>TO DO SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  BOI SAID THAT, IN LINE WITH VIETNAM\'S EFFORTS "TO </p><p>BE FRIENDS WITH ALL NATIONS," IT HAD EXPANDED ITS TIES WITH </p><p>ISRAEL TO A MORE "NORMAL RELATIONSHIP," ADDING THAT "THERE </p><p>IS NO REASON" THAT ECONOMIC TIES COULD NOT INCREASE.  THE </p><p>MFA\'S TU NOTED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS OFFICIAL VISITS </p><p>(BUT NOT VERY HIGH LEVEL) SINCE ISRAEL OPENED ITS EMBASSY IN </p><p>HANOI IN 1993, INCLUDING THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE ISRAELI </p><p>MFA ASIA AND PACIFIC IN JANUARY 2001, AND A DELEGATION FROM </p><p>THE ISRAEL MANUFACTURERS\' ASSOCIATION IN APRIL 2001.  THE </p><p>GVN DEPUTY MINISTER OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND ENVIRONMENT </p><p>VISITED ISRAEL IN 2000.  TU CLAIMED THAT VIETNAM\'S "NORMAL" </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL "HAS NOT AFFECTED" ITS FRIENDSHIPS </p><p>WITH ARAB STATES, BECAUSE "THEY UNDERSTAND WE SEEK GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ALL COUNTRIES."  TU ADDED THAT DESPITE GVN </p><p>WISHES TO OPEN AN EMBASSY IN ISRAEL SINCE 1993, THERE ARE </p><p>STILL NO CONCRETE PLANS TO DO SO.  VIETNAM\'S AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>CAIRO IS ACCREDITED TO ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  ACCORDING TO ISRAELI EMBASSY SECOND SECRETARY EYAL </p><p>BUVILSKI, ISRAEL IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON EXPANDING BILATERAL </p><p>TRADE WITH VIETNAM, NOW ONLY ABOUT USD 25 MILLION ANNUALLY. </p><p>HE SAID THAT WHILE THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL INCREASE IN </p><p>INTEREST FROM ISRAELI BUSINESSMEN, LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS, SUCH </p><p>AS WORKING WITH LOCAL BANKS AND OBTAINING VISAS, REMAIN </p><p>OBSTACLES.  ISRAEL HAS EXPRESSED A HOPE THAT THE GVN SOON </p><p>ESTABLISH SOME SORT OF OFFICIAL REPRESENTATION IN ISRAEL, </p><p>SUCH AS A TRADE REPRESENTATIVE, TO FACILITATE SUCH TIES. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02817  01 OF 03  290455Z </p><p>BUVILSKI NOTED THAT ISRAEL IS ALSO INTERESTED IN EXPANDING </p><p>ITS ONGOING AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM AND IN </p><p>PROVIDING TRAINING FOR ADDITIONAL VIETNAMESE STUDENTS IN </p><p>ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>AFGHANISTAN:  WORRIES ABOUT CIVILIANS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU)  NGUYEN HUY DZUNG, SENIOR EXPERT IN THE MFA\'S ASIA </p><p>II DEPARTMENT, CHARACTERIZED VIETNAM\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>AFGHANISTAN AS "NONEXISTENT," BOTH POLITICALLY AND </p><p>ECONOMICALLY.  VIETNAM MAINTAINED AN EMBASSY IN KABUL FROM </p><p>1982-1992 BUT THEN CLOSED IT DUE TO THE CIVIL WAR AND </p><p>VIETNAM\'S OWN DIFFICULT FINANCIAL SITUATION.  DZUNG </p><p>REAFFIRMED VIETNAM\'S OPPOSITION TO "TERRORISM OF ANY KIND" </p><p>BUT EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE ONGOING US-LED MILITARY </p><p>ATTACKS IN AFGHANISTAN DUE TO THE LIKELY IMPACT ON CIVILIAN </p><p>POPULATIONS, A LINE REPEATED IN OFFICIAL MEDIA REPEATEDLY IN </p><p>RECENT DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  THE MFA\'S BOI SEPARATELY NOTED THAT THE GVN IS </p><p>KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON FIVE AFGHAN NATIONALS APPARENTLY </p><p>TEACHING AT AN ARABIC-LANGUAGE SCHOOL LOCATED ON THE LIBYAN </p><p>EMBASSY COMPOUND. (NOTE:  REF B REPORTED ONLY FOUR AFGHANS </p><p>AT THIS SCHOOL WHO WORSHIP AT HANOI\'S SOLE MOSQUE.)  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THREE SHOULD BE LEAVING THE COUNTRY "SOON," </p><p>SINCE THEIR VISAS HAVE EXPIRED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>PAKISTAN:  LITTLE STEPS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) DR. FAZAL-UR-RAHMAN KAZI, THE PAKISTAN EMBASSY\'S </p><p>FIRST SECRETARY, TOLD POLOFF ON OCTOBER 16 THAT PAKISTAN IS </p><p>ANXIOUS TO IMPROVE ITS POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH VIETNAM AS PART OF ITS OWN EFFORT "TO BECOME MORE </p><p>ENGAGED IN SOUTHEAST ASIA."  PAKISTAN ESTABLISHED RELATIONS </p><p>WITH VIETNAM IN 1973, BUT CLOSED ITS EMBASSY IN 1985, DUE TO </p><p>"FINANCIAL REASONS."  DR. FAZI DESCRIBED THIS MOVE AS A </p><p>"MISTAKE" THAT WAS NOT RECTIFIED UNTIL OCTOBER 2000. </p><p>HOWEVER, VIETNAM STILL DOES NOT HAVE AN EMBASSY IN </p><p>ISLAMABAD, ALTHOUGH IT HAS AGREED "IN PRINCIPLE" TO OPEN </p><p>ONE, ACCORDING TO DR. KAZI. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  PAKISTANI LEADER GENERAL MUSHARRAF VISITED VIETNAM </p><p>FOR THREE DAYS IN MAY 2001, DURING WHICH THE TWO COUNTRIES </p><p>SIGNED A TRADE AGREEMENT, A DRAFT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY </p><p>AGREEMENT, AND AN AGREEMENT TO FORM A JOINT MINISTERIAL </p><p>COMMISSION.  THE GVN DURING THE VISIT ALSO PLEDGED SUPPORT </p><p>FOR PAKISTAN\'S GOAL OF BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE ASEAN </p><p>REGIONAL FORUM AND THE ASIA-EUROPE FORUM.  DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER NGUYEN CONG TAN HAS NOW POSTPONED HIS VISIT TO </p><p>PAKISTAN SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER, CITING THE ONGOING MILITARY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02817  02 OF 03  290455Z </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN THE REGION, DR. KAZI ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  DR. KAZI ADMITTED THAT THE BILATERAL ECONOMIC </p><p>RELATIONSHIP IS "LIMITED," WITH BILATERAL TRADE ONLY WORTH </p><p>ABOUT USD 25 MILLION IN 2000.  PAKISTAN IMPORTED </p><p>APPROXIMATELY USD 16 MILLION WORTH OF GOODS FROM VIETNAM, </p><p>PRIMARILY TEA, BLACK PEPPER AND FOOTWEAR, WHILE VIETNAM </p><p>IMPORTED ABOUT USD 9 MILLION WORTH OF FERTILIZER, YARN, </p><p>COTTON, AND OTHER GOODS.  BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE PLEDGED TO </p><p>INCREASE THE TRADE VOLUME TO USD 100 MILLION, BUT DR. KAZI </p><p>SAID THAT THERE ARE NO FIRM TARGETS ON WHEN TO ACHIEVE THIS </p><p>GOAL.  DR. KAZI ADDED THAT ONE SIGNIFICANT LOGISTICAL </p><p>PROBLEM FOR PAKISTANI BUSINESSMEN IS THEY CANNOT OBTAIN </p><p>VIETNAMESE VISAS IN PAKISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  THE MFA\'S DZUNG SEPARATELY CONFIRMED THAT VIETNAM </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE BILATERAL TRADE WITH PAKISTAN, </p><p>CLAIMING THAT THIS IS NOW VIETNAM\'S "PRIMARY INTEREST" IN </p><p>THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  ACCORDINGLY, VIETNAM IS </p><p>"EXPLORING VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES," HE ADDED WITHOUT OFFERING </p><p>ANY SPECIFICS.  DZUNG NOTED THAT THE IMPROVING POLITICAL AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL TIES WITH PAKISTAN ARE IN LINE WITH THE 9TH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS\' POLICY STATEMENT TO INCREASE VIETNAM\'S PRESENCE IN </p><p>"ALL SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES."  HE ALSO NOTED THAT VIETNAM </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO OPEN AN EMBASSY IN PAKISTAN, BUT ADMITTED HE </p><p>NOT KNOW WHEN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DO SO.  HE AND DR. </p><p>KAZI MADE PARALLEL STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW THE BILATERAL </p><p>ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP COULD IMPROVE QUICKLY ONCE THE </p><p>SITUATION IN THE REGION "STABILIZES." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02817  02 OF 03  290455Z </p><p>"TRADITIONAL FRIENDS" </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  THE MFA\'S BOI, DESCRIBED IRAQ (ALONG WITH LIBYA) </p><p>AS VIETNAM\'S MOST IMPORTANT "TRADITIONAL FRIENDS" IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST DURING A MEETING WITH POLOFF ON OCTOBER 12.  HE </p><p>NOTED IN PARTICULAR THAT IRAQ HAD PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM DURING THE WAR WITH THE US. </p><p>SEPARATELY, COLONEL TRAN NHUNG, DIRECTOR OF THE PEOPLES\' </p><p>ARMY NEWSPAPER INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT, CLAIMED THAT </p><p>VIETNAM COULD NEVER FORGET IRAQ\'S "INVALUABLE SUPPORT" </p><p>DURING THAT PERIOD, WHILE ADMITTING THAT VIETNAM STILL </p><p>"OWES" IRAQ APPROXIMATELY USD 100 MILLION.  BOI NOTED THAT </p><p>VIETNAM HAD, HOWEVER, NOT SUPPORTED THE IRAQ\'S INVASION OF </p><p>KUWAIT.  COLONEL NHUNG STATED THAT VIETNAM HAD NONETHELESS </p><p>"PROTESTED" UN SANCTIONS BECAUSE THEY "ESSENTIALLY HURT </p><p>CIVILIANS." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  BOI STRESSED THAT THE IRAQ-VIETNAM COMMERCIAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP IS "COMPLETELY WITHIN THE UN FRAMEWORK." </p><p>VIETNAMESE EXPORTS TO IRAQ IN 2000 WERE WORTH APPROXIMATELY </p><p>USD319 MILLION, PRIMARILY RICE, RUBBER, TEXTILES, AND </p><p>GARMENTS.  VIETNAM IMPORTS MAINLY OIL FROM IRAQ, PARTLY FOR </p><p>RE-SALE ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET.   BUT BOI PREDICTED </p><p>THAT VIETNAM\'S TRADE WITH IRAQ WOULD DECLINE AS IRAQ </p><p>INCREASINGLY LOOKS TOWARD MORE TRADE WITH SYRIA, TUNISIA, </p><p>AND TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO SENIOR EXPERT TRAN VIET TU OF THE </p><p>MFA\'S WEST ASIA DEPARTMENT, ABOUT 2,000 VIETNAMESE NATIONALS </p><p>ARE CURRENTLY WORKING IN LIBYA, ANOTHER "TRADITIONAL </p><p>FRIEND."  "A FEW" OTHERS ARE WORKING IN LEBANON AND THE </p><p>UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE), HE ADDED.  IN LIBYA, MOST ARE IN </p><p>THE CONSTRUCTION FIELD, WORKING FOR SOUTH KOREAN </p><p>CONTRACTORS.  TU STATED THAT THE WORKERS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE </p><p>IN ANY DANGER, BUT IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATED, VIETNAM </p><p>WOULD TAKE ACTION TO REPATRIATE THEM.  HE NOTED THAT VIETNAM </p><p>HAD SUCCESSFULLY REPATRIATED 16,000 WORKERS FROM IRAQ DURING </p><p>THE GULF WAR; BRINGING BACK THOSE IN LIBYA, LEBANON, AND THE </p><p>UAE "WOULD NOT PRESENT A PROBLEM" SHOULD IT BE NECESSARY TO </p><p>DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU)  COMMENT:  MUCH AS VIETNAM WOULD LIKE TO ENHANCE </p><p>ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH NEWER PARTNERS AS WELL AS </p><p>"TRADITIONAL" FRIENDS IN AND NEAR THE MIDDLE EAST, DISTANCE, </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES AND WEAK MARKETS WILL REMAIN </p><p>UNAVOIDABLE CONSTRAINTS.  VIETNAM\'S OWN FINANCIAL </p><p>LIMITATIONS HAMPER ITS ABILITY TO OPEN NEW DIPLOMATIC </p><p>MISSIONS, A FURTHER DISINCENTIVE FOR THE KINDS OF </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS IN BILATERAL AND REGIONAL RELATIONS IT SEEKS. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02817  03 OF 03  290455Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
