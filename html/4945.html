<p>UNCLAS MONTREAL 000004 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.0. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: SMIG, KPAO, SOCI, KISL, PGOV, PTER, PREL, PBTS, CA, Smuggling, Border Patrol </p><p>SUBJECT: APPARENT ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM PRIMARILY PAKISTAN RESIDING </p><p>IN THE UNITED STATES ENTER CANADA TO SEEK POLITICAL ASYLUM </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: SOME 200 ALIENS, MOST OF THEM OF PAKISTANI ORIGIN, </p><p>FLOCKED TO THE NEW YORK-QUEBEC BORDER POST OF CHAMPLAIN-LACOLLE </p><p>IN AN ATTEMPT TO FILE FOR THE STATUS OF POLITICAL REFUGEE AT THE </p><p>CANADIAN BORDER IMMIGRATION OFFICE BEFORE THE START OF THE NEW </p><p>YEAR.  PAKISTANI CLAIMANTS SAID THEY WERE NOW LIVING IN FEAR IN </p><p>THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF POST- SEPTEMBER 11 CONDITIONS. </p><p>PAKISTANI CLAIMANTS SAID THEY WERE ALSO AFRAID THEY WOULD BE </p><p>DEPORTED IF THEY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO THE INS BETWEEN MID- </p><p>JANUARY AND MID-FEBRUARY. A TOP RANKING IMMIGRATION CANADA </p><p>OFFICIAL TOLD POST CLAIMANTS WERE WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES DESPITE THE FACT THEY APPARENTLY HAD NO LEGAL U.S. </p><p>IMMIGRATION STATUS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  BETWEEN DEC. 27, 2002 AND JAN. 3, 2003, 150 PAKISTANIS AND A </p><p>FEW DOZEN IMMIGRANTS FROM THE CONGO, LEBANON, PERU AND COLOMBIA </p><p>TOOK BUSES TO PLATTSBURGH, NEW YORK AND THEN TAXIS TO THE LAST </p><p>EXIT ON INTERSTATE 87 BEFORE WALKING THE LAST MILE INTO CANADA. </p><p>THE LAST CLAIMANT ARRIVED ON JAN.3 AT 10 A.M. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AT NOON ON JAN. 3 ALL BUT THREE HAD BEEN PROCESSED (PICTURED, </p><p>FINGERPRINTED AND THEIR CASE STORIES NOTED IN DEPOSITIONS WHICH </p><p>TOOK BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE HOURS). TO PROCESS THE OVERLOAD, </p><p>IMMIGRATION CANADA INCREASED THE NUMBER OF AGENTS FROM SIX TO </p><p>SIXTEEN PER SHIFT. AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR, THE USUAL NUMBER OF </p><p>REFUGEE APPLICANTS IS 6 PER DAY.  AN IMMIGRATION CANADA OFFICIAL </p><p>STATED TO THE MEDIA THAT CLAIMANTS BELIEVED CANADIAN REGULATIONS </p><p>WOULD CHANGE AS OF JAN. 1, 2003 AND THAT OTHERS THOUGHT "SAFE </p><p>THIRD COUNTRY" REGULATIONS WOULD COME INTO EFFECT THIS JANUARY </p><p>RATHER THAN LATER THIS SPRING. </p><p> </p><p>3.   APPLICANTS CLAIMED THEY HAD BEEN THREATENED AND HARASSED IN </p><p>THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 ATTACK ON NEW YORK AND </p><p>WASHINGTON. IMMIGRATION CANADA SOURCES ALSO TOLD POST THAT </p><p>CLAIMANTS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR AT LEAST </p><p>A YEAR AND SOME FOR AS MANY AS TEN YEARS.  IMMIGRATION CANADA </p><p>TOLD POST THAT ALL CLAIMANTS WERE ILLEGALLY RESIDING IN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND FEARED DEPORTATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  CLAIMANTS WERE RELEASED BY CANADIAN AUTHORITIES AFTER THEY </p><p>PROMISED THEY WOULD SHOW UP AT THEIR HEARINGS BEFORE THE </p><p>COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF REFUGEES. HEARINGS WILL START AS </p><p>EARLY AS JANUARY 2003. THE MERIT OF EACH CASE WILL BE EXAMINED </p><p>LIKE ANY OTHER POLITICAL REFUGEE CLAIM AND WILL NEED TO SATISFY </p><p>GENEVA CONVENTION REQUIREMENTS.  THE LONG CANADIAN ASYLUM CLAIM </p><p>EXAMINATION PROCESS CAN TAKE AS MUCH AS TWO YEARS, I.E. ENOUGH </p><p>TIME FOR CLAIMANTS TO FIND A LOCAL SPOUSE, OR FOR THE EVOLUTION </p><p>OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN TO CHANGE </p><p>SO AS TO WARRANT FURTHER STUDY. </p><p> </p><p>5.   NO OTHER U.S.-QUEBEC BORDER POST HAS RECENTLY BEEN THE SCENE </p><p>OF SUCH TRAFFIC. HOWEVER, SOME 200 SIMILAR APPLICANTS WERE </p><p>RECENTLY PROCESSED BOTH AT THE WINDSOR AND THE FORT ERIE POSTS IN </p><p>ONTARIO. IMMIGRATION CANADA SOURCES TOLD POST THAT BECAUSE THERE </p><p>IS NO BIG CITY SOUTH OF THE QUEBEC BORDER THERE IS ALSO NO </p><p>ORGANIZATION LIKE CASA VIVE WHICH HOUSES CLAIMANTS DURING THE </p><p>DOCUMENTATION PROCESS AT THE BUFFALO-FORT ERIE POST. THIS </p><p>EXPLAINS WHY CANADA WILL PROBABLY GO ON USING THE OLD TRAILER IT </p><p>KEEPS IN ITS LACOLLE BACKYARD. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THE ASYLUM CLAIMANTS </p><p>WILL RETURN FOR THEIR HEARINGS OR WHETHER THEY WILL MELT INTO </p><p>CANADIAN SOCIETY AS THEY APPARENTLY WERE ABLE TO DO IN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES WITHOUT BEING DETECTED BY U.S. AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  LOCAL MEDIA HAVE USED THE STORY OF YOUNG IRANIANS BEING </p><p>JAILED IN CALIFORNIA AFTER SHOWING UP AS REQUESTED BY INS NOTICES </p><p>TO CRITICIZE NEW U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS AND TO EMPHASIZE HARSH </p><p>TREATMENT OF ETHNIC GROUPS IN POST SEPTEMBER 11 AMERICA. WITH THE </p><p>ATTENTION BEING GIVEN TO THE PAKISTANIS AT THE BORDER AND THE FBI </p><p>SEEKING FIVE MEN ALLEGED TO HAVE ENTERED THE UNITED STATES </p><p>THROUGH THE AKWASASNE NATIVE RESERVE THAT STRADDLES THE U.S.- </p><p>CANADA BORDER, FURTHER CANADIAN MEDIA ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED </p><p>ON THE FATE OF THE PAKISTANIS WHO DO SHOW UP AT INS OFFICES IN </p><p>THE COMING MONTH. END OF COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>KANTER </p><p></p></div>
