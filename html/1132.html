<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L DAMASCUS 002976 </p><p> </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ILMG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1/26/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SY, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  ASAD SITREP 01: PRESIDENT ASAD HAS DIED; </p><p>SPECIAL PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE VOTES UNAIMOUSLY TO </p><p>LOWER REQUIRED AGE FOR PRESIDENCY TO 34, THE AGE OF </p><p>ASAD\'S SON BASHAR; NO OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHO HAS </p><p>ASSUMED CHARGE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RYAN C. CROCKER, REASON 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SYRIAN RADIO AND TELEVISION AT 1800 BROADCAST THE </p><p>OFFICIAL SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT TO PARLIAMENT </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT HAFIZ AL-ASAD HAD DIED.  THE SPEAKER OF </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT ABD AL-QADIR QADDURA ANNOUNCED A FEW </p><p>MINUTES LATER THAT A SPECIAL PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE HAD </p><p>BEEN FORMED TO DISCUSS AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. </p><p>AT APPROXIMATELY 1900 AN AMENDMENT WAS PASSED </p><p>UNAMIMOUSLY WHICH AMENDED THE CONSTITUTION TO SAY THAT A </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST BE A SYRIAN ARAB OF AT LEAST </p><p>34 YEARS OF AGE, BUT DID NOT NEED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>BA\'TH PARTY.  PREVIOUSLY THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRED THE </p><p>PRESIDENT TO BE A SYRIAN ARAB MUSLIM AT LEAST FORTY </p><p>YEARS OF AGE AND, IF NOT RECEIVING AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY </p><p>IN A NATIONAL REFERENDUM, BE SELECTED BY THE BA\'TH PARTY </p><p>FOR FORMAL NOMINATION TO THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IT WAS THEN ANNOUNCED THAT THE PARLIAMENT WOULD </p><p>RECESS UNTIL JUNE 25.  THE AMENDMENT IS CLEARLY INTENDED </p><p>DRAFTED TO ALLOW PRESIDENT ASAD\'S SON BASHAR TO BE </p><p>NOMINATED AS PRESIDENT, BUT HIS NAME HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>MENTIONED IN ANY OFFICIAL CONTEXT.  THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>STATES THAT IN CASE OF THE PRESIDENT\'S "DISABLEMENT" THE </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT--IN THIS CASE VP MUHAMMAD KHADDAM--WOULD </p><p>BECOME ACTING PRESIDENT AND THAT IN CASE OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S DEATH, A REFERENDUM MUST BE HELD WITHIN 90 </p><p>DAYS TO ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT.  HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>NO OFFICIAL ANNOUNCMENT THAT VP KHADDAM HAS ASSUMED THE </p><p>OFFICE OF PRESIDENT.  THE ARAB SATELLITE STATION AL- </p><p>JAZIRA IS REPORTING THAT IT HAS BEEN DECIDED THAT </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER MUSTAFA TALAS WILL ASSUME CHARGE </p><p>TEMPORARILY, BUT WE HAVE NO CONFIRMATION OF THAT REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) THE AMBASSADOR CONTACTED DEFENSE MINISTER MUSTAFA </p><p>TALAS AT APPROXIMATELY 1745 (BEFORE THE OFFICIAL </p><p>ANNOUNCEMNT), WHO CONFIRMED ASAD\'S DEATH AND ASSURED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT WHILE THE SARG WAS "TAKING APPROPRIATE </p><p>MEASURES," EVERYTHING WAS CALM.  AT 1945, STREETS HAVE </p><p>BEEN CLOSED AROUND THE CHANCERY AND CROWDS ARE AMASSING </p><p>AROUND THE PRESIDENT\'S HOME, WHICH IS LOCATED </p><p>APPROXIMATELY TWO BLOCKS FROM THE CHANCERY.  WE HAVE NO </p><p>SIGN OF ANY CROWDS MOVING TOWARDS OR AGAINST THE </p><p>CHANCERY.  CROWDS ARE SHOUTING CHANTS PRAISING THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND IN SUPPORT OF BASHAR. </p><p> </p><p>CROCKER </p><p></p></div>
