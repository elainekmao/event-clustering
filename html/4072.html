(A) KATHMANDU 2025 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1970 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  This message updates Maoist activities since the </p><p>October 11 appointment of Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur </p><p>Chand.  Efforts by Chand\'s Cabinet to initiate dialogue with </p><p>the insurgents have so far succeeded in lessening neither the </p><p>Maoists\' violent activities nor their anti-government </p><p>rhetoric.  A Maoist-affiliated trade union has declared a </p><p>general strike in the Kathmandu Valley for October 28.  The </p><p>National Human Rights Commission issued statements condemning </p><p>violations by both the Maoists and the security forces.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>PEACE FEELERS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The newly installed interim government of Prime </p><p>Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand is letting it be known, both </p><p>publicly and privately, that it is attempting to find ways to </p><p>restart dialogue with the Maoists, whose violent insurgency </p><p>has cost the lives of more than 5,500 Nepalis. The Maoists\' </p><p>response to these overtures so far, at least publicly, has </p><p>been cool, resulting in neither a reduction in their violent </p><p>activities nor any tempering of their heated anti-government </p><p>rhetoric.  Many observers expect the insurgents to string the </p><p>new government along for as long as possible, neither </p><p>accepting nor rejecting negotiations, while continuing to </p><p>seek advantage from deep divisions between mainstream </p><p>political parties and the caretaker Cabinet appointed by the </p><p>King. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>TRADE UNION DECLARES BANDH </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In addition to the previously announced November </p><p>11-13 general strike, or "bandh," a press release from the </p><p>Maoist-affiliated trade union, received by the media October </p><p>23, threatened a Kathmandu Valley bandh for October 28 unless </p><p>a list of 24 demands, presented to the Labor Ministry and </p><p>selected businessmen, were met.  The demands include a 100 </p><p>percent increase in the minimum wage, free accommodations and </p><p>medical care for workers, and free education for workers\' </p><p>children. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>CIVILIAN TOLL </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The insurgents have killed more than 250 civilians </p><p>since the beginning of the year, including 21 during the </p><p>month of October.  Their victims range from teachers to local </p><p>political workers to hapless passersby.  On October 12 a bomb </p><p>set by suspected Maoists at a statue of late King Mahendra in </p><p>downtown Kathmandu killed one bystander and injured several </p><p>others.  On October 17 a gang of armed Maoists abducted Mohan </p><p>Bahadur Khatri, a retired Army major, from a hotel he owned </p><p>in eastern Nepal, then shot and stabbed him to death.  Khatri </p><p>was respected as a social worker who supported educational, </p><p>medical clinics, and drinking water projects in the area of </p><p>rural Sindhupalchowk where he had built his resort.  On </p><p>October 19 a bomb in a busy street in the Kathmandu Valley </p><p>town of Banepa killed a female vegetable vendor whose sales </p><p>supported two young children.  A bomb set in an auto parts </p><p>store in downtown Kathmandu the evening of October 23 injured </p><p>eight, many of them waiting outside at a nearby bus stop.  On </p><p>October 21 armed villagers in eastern Dolakha District </p><p>secured the release of five men who had been abducted by the </p><p>Maoists several days earlier.  Local press reports on October </p><p>19 noted a skyrocketing dropout rate among school-aged youth </p><p>in Rukum District.  The report attributed the phenomenon to </p><p>increased out-migration from the district by youths </p><p>attempting to avoid Maoist conscription. </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>TOLL ON INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5.  (U)  According to a recently completed USAID study, </p><p>Maoist attacks on hydropower facilities over the past seven </p><p>months have left nearly 132,000 Nepalis without electricity. </p><p>Maoist attacks on telecommunications infrastructure have left </p><p>19 of Nepal\'s 75 districts with no telephone service.  The </p><p>insurgents have particularly focused their destructive </p><p>activities on the mid-western Maoist heartland, cutting off </p><p>200 Village Development Committees (VDCs) from telephone in </p><p>the past year alone. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>OPERATIONS AGAINST EXTORTION </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) According to local press reports, one civilian was </p><p>killed in crossfire when the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) engaged a </p><p>large band of Maoists attempting to conscript recruits from a </p><p>village in Syangja District in central Nepal October 18-20. </p><p>Acting on reports of Maoist extortion in Bardiya District in </p><p>southwestern Nepal, the RNA mounted an operation resulting in </p><p>the deaths of 15 reported Maoists in the area.  (Note:  The </p><p>largest food distributor in Nepal, who owns a warehouse in </p><p>the area, confirmed to us that Maoist extortion and looting </p><p>had worsened so much that he was considering closing his </p><p>operations there.  End note.)   Reacting to RNA proscriptions </p><p>against local merchants supplying food to suspected Maoists </p><p>in the Maoist heartland, the insurgents have slapped a </p><p>counter-ban on the import of food to the headquarters of </p><p>Rukum District.  As a result, severe food shortages among the </p><p>general population are being reported in Rukum and </p><p>neighboring areas.  Many residents--including, according to </p><p>some reports, civil servants in the area--are leaving the </p><p>vicinity and moving south, where food is more readily </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>RIGHTS COMMISSION FAULTS BOTH SIDES </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) On October 22 the National Human Rights Commission </p><p>(NHRC) issued a press release citing the security forces for </p><p>staged encounters; excessive force, including torture; </p><p>illegal detention; and insensitivity to "the basic needs of </p><p>education, food and health rights of the people in (the </p><p>security forces\') bid to curb the facilities of the Maoists." </p><p> The release was based on investigations conducted in 35 </p><p>districts.  Presenting a summary of its findings to PM Chand, </p><p>the NHRC urged him to halt the violations and "declare a </p><p>cease fire and lead the process towards peace." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  The NHRC followed up its presentation to Chand with </p><p>an October 23 letter to Maoist leader Prachanda noting </p><p>insurgents\' violations of the Geneva Convention.  The </p><p>Commission specifically asked him to stop the indiscriminate </p><p>killing, torture and abduction of civilians and unarmed </p><p>security personnel; destruction of infrastructure and </p><p>development projects; and terrorizing of teachers and </p><p>students.  The letter also urged an end to recruitment of </p><p>children into insurgent ranks, as well as the blockade of </p><p>humanitarian supplies and services. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
