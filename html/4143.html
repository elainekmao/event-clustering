SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary: Zimbabwe is in the midst of inter-related and </p><p>deepening political, economic, social and humanitarian crises </p><p>which are steadily spiraling downward.  We do not believe </p><p>that there are separate solutions to these crises and are </p><p>convinced that any effective remedy must address all the </p><p>crises, including the political one.  The only consolation in </p><p>this sorry picture is that more top ZANU-PF leaders recognize </p><p>the seriousness of the crisis and comprehend that they might </p><p>not have the solutions to the problems working alone.  There </p><p>is not yet any signal, however, that the top leadership is </p><p>prepared to address these deep crises in any way that might </p><p>compromise its increasingly absolutist power. Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>neighbors are increasingly cognizant of the depth of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s crises and the potential implications for </p><p>themselves, but their responses remain mostly timid and </p><p>tentative.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  As detailed in other reporting, Zimbabwe\'s social, </p><p>humanitarian, economic and political crises continue to </p><p>deepen and are increasingly and inextricably related. </p><p> </p><p>-- (U) Social Disintegration: The most quantifiable element </p><p>of this crisis is an HIV-AIDS rate among the adult population </p><p>of about 34 per cent, with over 3,000 AIDS related deaths per </p><p>week, 800,000 AIDS orphans and life expectancy shortened to </p><p>38 years.  These horrific statistics relate closely to other </p><p>crises, since food shortages and impoverishment due to </p><p>economic decline ensure earlier deaths for the infected and </p><p>make the task of supporting HIV-infected families much more </p><p>difficult.  The degradation of the health system, due to </p><p>emigration of skilled personnel and shortages of medicines, </p><p>is dramatic. Fixed pension rates and high inflation have </p><p>impoverished most pensioners.  While family support networks </p><p>continue to function in many cases, they are being stretched </p><p>beyond the limits. There are previously unheard of cases of </p><p>city relatives unable to support their rural families or even </p><p>turning away their rural relatives coming to stay near town </p><p>and orphans being rejected by their extended families. The </p><p>part of the traditional family support network which is </p><p>probably most effective is the remittances sent home by </p><p>Zimbabweans working overseas.  While the Government\'s </p><p>political rhetoric defends the poorest Zimbabweans, </p><p>ineffective economic policies are the largest contributors to </p><p>the population\'s poverty.  All of these problems are </p><p>worsening, and are unlikely to improve absent a major </p><p>economic and political turnaround.  Moreover,the Government\'s </p><p>single-minded political focus on the land issue, and </p><p>concomitantly to retaining power relegates its focus on </p><p>HIV/AIDS to a health problem to be dealt with by the Health </p><p>Ministry with only occasional lip service by higher-ups. </p><p> </p><p>-- (U) Economic Collapse: Zimbabwe\'s economy is arguably in </p><p>the most rapid freefall of any country on earth not at war. </p><p>GDP has declined  by about a quarter in the last three years </p><p>and GDP per capita has declined to levels below those of its </p><p>historically much poorer neighbor Mozambique. Inflation is </p><p>conservatively pegged at 140 per cent per annum and the </p><p>national currency has lost 77 per cent of its value in a </p><p>year.  The GOZ is virtually bereft of foreign currency as the </p><p>tobacco season comes to an end, unable to pay for the fuel, </p><p>food and spare part imports it desperately needs. </p><p>Zimbabweans are demonstrating legendary resilience in coping </p><p>in their  businesses and personal lives, and the informal </p><p>sector has exploded in recent years to compensate for the </p><p>tremendous decline in the formal economy and increased </p><p>unemployment.  Even if Zimbabwe avoids another drought, next </p><p>year\'s tobacco crop will be drastically reduced and overall </p><p>agricultural production is crippled for years to come due to </p><p>the disruption of the commercial farms and the Government\'s </p><p>inability to provide necessary inputs to new farmers. </p><p>Similarly, Zimbabwe\'s wildlife resources and tourism sectors </p><p>are being depleted at alarming rates.  The GOZ\'s "optimistic" </p><p>forecast for 2003 calls for a further 5 per cent GDP </p><p>retraction. </p><p> </p><p>-- (U) Humanitarian crisis:  Food shortages are the most </p><p>evident manifestation of an enormous humanitarian crisis. </p><p>Over half the Zimbabwean population is short of food. Almost </p><p>every area of the country will be needy in the months before </p><p>next March\'s maize harvest.  The Government has long been </p><p>over-confident of its ability to import enough maize to meet </p><p>this emergency, but does not have the foreign exchange nor </p><p>the time/logisitics to meet the need.  The GOZ has also </p><p>declined to change its monopolistic practices, its 40 per </p><p>cent duty on imported maize meal or its price controls on </p><p>cereals, or adjust exchange rate policies which currently </p><p>prevent the private sector from importing food for those </p><p>Zimbabweans who could buy their own maize.  International </p><p>food assistance is also likely to fall considerably short of </p><p>WFP Director Morris\'s delivery target of 55,000 MT\'s per </p><p>month by December due to government obstacles to the presence </p><p>of NGO\'s, the delays resulting from controversy over biotech </p><p>food and mediocre donor response to a Zimbabwean food crisis </p><p>caused largely by retrograde Government policies. Government </p><p>policies driven by political considerations continue to </p><p>impede international assistance and to direct GOZ food in a </p><p>blatantly partisan manner.  There are as yet no mass </p><p>migrations of hungry people, only a few of the swollen </p><p>bellies and emaciated children characteristic of famine and </p><p>only a small number of deaths clearly attributed to </p><p>starvation.  We do believe, however, that there are numerous </p><p>people dying quietly in their villages from HIV- and non-HIV </p><p>related illnesses compounded by poor nutrition.  And with the </p><p>worst five months in Zimbabwe\'s agricultural cycle still </p><p>ahead, these problems will grow more acute, with an as yet </p><p>unassessed risk of a much more serious humanitarian crisis. </p><p>-- (C) Political crisis:  Zimbabwe\'s political crisis is </p><p>worsening steadily as the ZANU-PF utilizes the advantages of </p><p>governmental control to orchestrate a campaign of violence </p><p>and intimidation against the opposition leadership and </p><p>supporters, influential civic organizations, the judiciary </p><p>and all other individuals and institutions perceived as a </p><p>threat. The MDC is portrayed in the state media, to voters </p><p>and even to other Africans as an illegitimate, </p><p>foreign-sponsored party that can and will be defeated with </p><p>every imaginable method from violence and threats to </p><p>deprivation or reward with food and public projects </p><p>explicitly linked to the constituency\'s support for the </p><p>ZANU-PF. MDC leaders and parliamentarians are prosecuted on </p><p>trumped-up charges and lower-level MDC candidates or </p><p>supporters are beaten, threatened and, at times killed for </p><p>supporting the opposition.  MDC rallies and political </p><p>campaigning are largely barred by new repressive legislation. </p><p> NGO\'s which have links to the MDC or provide the </p><p>documentation of GOZ human rights abuses are increasingly </p><p>under siege.  Independent media are also under siege by the </p><p>state with editors and journalists being prosecuted on </p><p>multiple charges of violating repressive new media </p><p>legislation, which also increases government controls over </p><p>all journalists -- foreign or domestic. The message from </p><p>Government and ZANU leaders and from all-pervasive state </p><p>media is that support for the opposition, and even failure to </p><p>support the Government is illegitimate and will be punished </p><p>by either withdrawal of state benefits or more direct </p><p>measures. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While Government leaders remain triumphalist in </p><p>public, some Party and Government heavies are beginning to </p><p>acknowledge privately the depth of the crisis they face and </p><p>their inability to resolve it themselves.  While this is </p><p>progress, it comes late and is thus far inadequate to reflect </p><p>a serious opportunity for engagement.  For instance, the GOZ </p><p>recently wrote the UN ResRep to suggest cooperation to assist </p><p>displaced commercial farm workers, compensate displaced </p><p>commercial farmers and provide agricultural assistance for </p><p>new farmers.  Putative GOZ concern for displaced commercial </p><p>farm workers and farmers is both hypocritical and </p><p>transparent, but the appeal for agricultural assistance to </p><p>new farmers recognizes that the GOZ does not have the means </p><p>to support these new farmers to make the land resettlement </p><p>exercise a success.  The UN will not take up this </p><p>half-hearted GOZ appeal but will continue to test when the </p><p>Government might be more sincere in its approaches.  The GOZ, </p><p>which for some four months after the election appeared to </p><p>glory in its isolation and defiance of international opinion, </p><p>has been of late on a largely unsuccessful charm offensive to </p><p>show off its successes and to reopen channels of </p><p>communication.  For instance, ZANU-PF recently reached out </p><p>through intermediaries to the Australian Government and the </p><p>Commonwealth; the GOZ welcomed South African re-engagement on </p><p>Zimbabwe perhaps through a November bilateral commission </p><p>(although it is unclear whether the GOZ will be any more </p><p>flexible than it has in the past) and the SADC Committee for </p><p>Zimbabwe is sue to visit in the coming months. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Some influential members of the ruling party politburo </p><p>acknowledge privately that President Mugabe is a liability </p><p>and have quietly discussed a post-Mugabe era, but no one </p><p>seems willing to press the President too hard on his </p><p>retirement plans. Moreover, these discussions are mostly </p><p>focused on how to ensure ZANU-PF\'s hold on power rather than </p><p>on working with the MDC to extricate Zimbabwe from its </p><p>current predicament. Some high-ranking GOZ officials have </p><p>also reached out to us, directly and indirectly.  We have </p><p>stressed to them the depth of the crises facing the country, </p><p>the need to address the political crisis in order to resolve </p><p>the country\'s other problems and the need to find solutions </p><p>together with other Zimbabweans rather than expect that a </p><p>separate deal is possible with the US or other countries. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  While it is encouraging that more GOZ and </p><p>ZANU officials have begun to recognize the depth of the </p><p>problems, we have not yet seen signals that they are prepared </p><p>to change their political approach of crushing the opposition </p><p>and ruling through whatever violent or repressive means are </p><p>necessary with increasing reliance on the security forces. </p><p>Nonetheless, the depth of the country\'s problems will make </p><p>this a calculation to be tested regularly in the months </p><p>ahead.  As repression intensifies and the economy contracts, </p><p>prospects for civil unrest increase. Most Zimbabweans seem </p><p>more concerned, however, with keeping their heads down and </p><p>making ends meet. Ultimately, any sustainable solution to </p><p>this country\'s political crisis and the economic, social and </p><p>humanitarian crises it has spawned, must address the question </p><p>of the Government\'s legitimacy and ensure respect for genuine </p><p>political competition. </p><p> </p><p> , </p><p>. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
