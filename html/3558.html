<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002505 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDA FAS FOR FAA/AME/PAUL HOFFMAN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W - DAN EPSTEIN </p><p> </p><p>TOFAS 013 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958, N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FOOD FOR PROGRESS PROPOSAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. The American Embassy in Nigeria is proposing a </p><p>Government-to-Government "Food For Progress" activity for </p><p>FY 2003.  This program will involve 25,000 mt of soybean </p><p>and/or soybean meal (SBM) at $200 per mt.  Africare will be </p><p>the consultant to the Nigerian Government, managing the </p><p>sale of the commodities and the activities to be carried </p><p>out with the funding.  The American Soybean Association </p><p>strongly endorses a carefully constructed proposal and will </p><p>provide technical support to the importers.  The proposal </p><p>also has the support of FAS Lagos, Amembassy Abuja, the </p><p>local trade and the Nigerian Government, including </p><p>President Obasanjo.  There are no Bellmon or UMR issues. </p><p>The funds will be used to support a joint program of the </p><p>Government of Nigeria and Africare, called `Wise\' - The </p><p>Women\'s Initiative for Sex Education and Economic </p><p>Empowerment.  The goal of the `Wise\' program is to </p><p>economically empower and provide HIV/AIDS awareness to low </p><p>income and vulnerable young women living in the Federal </p><p>Capital Territory of Nigeria.  It is anticipated </p><p>that the plan of operations will be submitted in September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. There are several factors resulting in increased </p><p>demand for soybean products in Nigeria that open the </p><p>possibility for the import of U.S. soybean and feed-stuffs, </p><p>including : </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- a large population growing at approximately 3 percent </p><p>annually; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- an annual growth in the Nigerian poultry industry of 20% </p><p>over the past three years; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- high tariff on imported chicken, in an effort to </p><p>protect local producers; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the existing feed industry is operating below its </p><p>installed processing capacities; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- knowledge and understanding of the feed and poultry </p><p>industry trying to rebuild after more than two decades of </p><p>decline; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- interest and investment in soybean processing capacity, </p><p>creating a new market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  A few companies in Nigeria import feed-stuffs, </p><p>primarily wheat and some soybean meal.  Available </p><p>statistics, however, are not reliable.  Industry sources </p><p>estimate Nigeria\'s consumption requirement at more than </p><p>200,000 mt of soybean annually, and the market is growing. </p><p>Nigeria became a significant importer of soybean meal in </p><p>1999 following the revitalization of the poultry sector </p><p>after nearly two decades of decline.  Prior to this, the </p><p>local feed industry was able to secure adequate supplies of </p><p>soybean meal from the oilseed processing sector.  Based </p><p>upon FAS Lagos surveys of the feed industry, total soybean </p><p>meal imports in calendar 1999 are estimated at 12,000 tons. </p><p>Soybean meal imports increased to 21,000 tons and 30,000 </p><p>tons in 2000 and 2001 respectively.  The bulk of the SBM </p><p>appears to be crushed from local beans.  One importer is </p><p>investing in a line of extruders with a total capacity </p><p>of 100 mt per day.  He is interested in importing U.S. </p><p>soybeans to make feed for his poultry operations and to </p><p>trade full fat or partially defatted soybean meal on the </p><p>open market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Positive factors that suggest using monetization </p><p>in Nigeria include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A) a growing market, though somewhat constrained by </p><p>Forex financing difficulties and low volumes, which </p><p>increase product, shipping and transaction costs. </p><p>Monetized SBM could increase the overall consumption and </p><p>therefore be additive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B)  The market is already fairly large.  At 200,000 mt </p><p>consumption per annum, a program of slightly more than 10% </p><p>should not be considered disruptive.  The Nigerian </p><p>Government\'s request indicates that local authorities have </p><p>no concerns about market disruptions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C)  Soybean imports would be a new import and offer </p><p>considerable value to the local industry by encouraging </p><p>local value-added, increased throughput (which increases </p><p>demand and benefits to local soybean farmers). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D)  Imports of beans also increase capacity utilization </p><p>in the existing crushing mills and reduce Nigeria\'s </p><p>dependence on vegetable oil imports.  This program would be </p><p>additive and not disruptive to the established trade. </p><p>There are significant positive economic effects of </p><p>financing value-adding activities in the agricultural </p><p>sector without a foreign exchange outlay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  A well managed monetization program that gives </p><p>opportunity to multiple buyers (either through </p><p>multiple product mix, regional sales, or some similar </p><p>arrangements) would be beneficial for the buyer, the </p><p>pvo/seller and for U.S. exports.  We support this soybean </p><p>initiative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Ambassador Jeter is well aware of this proposal and </p><p>fully endorses it.  President Obasanjo wrote to the </p><p>Ambassador on August 20 and requested that the proposed </p><p>project be implemented as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  This cable was drafted by FAS Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
