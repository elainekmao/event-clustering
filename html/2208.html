(SBU) SUMMARY:  VIETNAM IS GENERALLY MEETING ITS </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS WORLD BANK AND IMF </p><p>POVERTY REDUCTION LOANS ACCORDING TO HANOI-BASED DONOR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES.  VIETNAM\'S MACRO-ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IS </p><p>CURRENTLY ON TARGET ALTHOUGH AN EARLIER FAILURE TO AGREE ON </p><p>CREDIT GROWTH TARGETS HAS DELAYED THE SCHEDULED RELEASE OF </p><p>THE SECOND TRANCHE OF THE IMF LOAN.  HOWEVER, THE IMF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN HANOI EXPECTS THE IMF BOARD WILL APPROVE </p><p>THE RELEASE WHEN IT CONSIDERS THE ISSUE AS SCHEDULED ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 24.  PROGRESS ON TRADE REFORM IS AT PRESENT AHEAD </p><p>OF SCHEDULE ALTHOUGH BANKING REFORM IS LAGGING SLIGHTLY. </p><p>THE AREA OF GREATEST DIFFICULTY HAS BEEN IN STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISE REFORM.  HOWEVER THE PACE OF WORK ON SOE REFORM </p><p>HAS INCREASED SINCE HE COMMUNIST PARTY GAVE EXPLICIT </p><p>POLITICAL APPROVAL IN LATE AUGUST TO RESTRUCTURE THE SOE </p><p>SECTOR.  THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR GREATER GVN AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOCUS AND EMPHASIS ON DOMESTIC </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AS A NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE </p><p>ACCOMPANIMENT TO ECONOMIC, TRADE, AND FINANCIAL REFORMS. </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE A CENTRAL THEME FOR THE </p><p>USG AT NEXT MONTH\'S CONSULTATIVE GROUP MEETING.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) AS NEXT MONTH\'S ANNUAL CONSULTATIVE GROUP (CG) </p><p>MEETING DRAWS NEAR, HANOI-BASED DONOR REPRESENTATIVES, </p><p>INCLUDING IMF AND WORLD BANK OFFICIALS, BRIEFED ECONOFF ON </p><p>THE STATUS OF REFORM EFFORTS AND AGREE THAT VIETNAM IS </p><p>GENERALLY "ON TRACK" FOR MEETING ITS REFORM OBLIGATIONS </p><p>UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF ITS POVERTY REDUCTIONS LOANS IN ALL </p><p>MAJOR AREAS INCLUDING MACRO-ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE GOALS, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03054  01 OF 02  201049Z </p><p>TRADE, BANKING AND STATE OWNED ENTERPRISE (SOE) REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ACCORDING TO THE IMF RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE SUSAN </p><p>ADAMS, PROGRESS IS BEST ON MACRO-ECONOMIC TARGETS.  IN FACT, </p><p>VIETNAM IS OVER-PERFORMING ON THE FISCAL SIDE DUE TO HIGHER- </p><p>THAN-EXPECTED TAX REVENUES.  THESE HAVE ALLOWED THE GVN TO </p><p>MEET ITS BUDGETARY TARGETS DESPITE LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH.  GVN FOOT-DRAGGING ON SOME REQUIRED PRIOR </p><p>ACTIONS IN THE MONETARY SIDE, IN PARTICULAR CREDIT GROWTH </p><p>TARGETS, TEMPORARILY DELAYED THE RELEASE OF THE $52.5 </p><p>MILLION SECOND TRANCHE OF VIETNAM\'S $374 MILLION POVERTY </p><p>REDUCTION GROWTH FACILITY FROM THE IMF.  BUT THE GVN HAS NOW </p><p>COMPLETED ALL NECESSARY STEPS, AND THE IMF BOARD IS </p><p>SCHEDULED TO CONSIDER RELEASE OF THE TRANCHE AT ITS NOVEMBER </p><p>24 MEETING.  ACCORDING TO ADAMS, THERE ARE "NO REAL PROBLEMS </p><p>NOW." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) ADAMS AGREES WITH WORLD BANK CHIEF ECONOMIST KAZI </p><p>MATIN THAT THE GVN IS AHEAD OF THE GAME ON TRADE, WHERE THE </p><p>REFORM PACKAGE LARGELY RESTS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE U.S.- </p><p>VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE (BTA) AGREEMENT.  MATIN POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT THE GVN IS MAKING LEGAL CHANGES NEEDED TO MEET </p><p>OBLIGATIONS THAT TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY ENTRY-INTO-FORCE OF </p><p>THE BTA, EXPECTED SHORTLY AFTER VIETNAM\'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>APPROVES THE AGREEMENT IN ITS CURRENT SESSION (END NOVEMBER </p><p>OR SO).  MATIN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER ALL </p><p>THOSE CHANGES WILL BE EFFECTIVE UPON ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE </p><p>BTA OR WHETHER VIETNAM WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF </p><p>THE OBLIGATIONS.  BUT HE NOTES THE GVN HAS MADE OBVIOUS AND </p><p>REAL EFFORTS TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE IN ADVANCE OF BTA ENTRY </p><p>INTO FORCE IN A NUMBER OF AREAS AND THINKS THIS MOMENTUM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03054  01 OF 02  201049Z </p><p>BODES WELL FOR THE FUTURE.  (COMMENT:  WHILE THE GVN MAY NOT </p><p>BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH EVERY OBLIGATION UNDER THE BTA </p><p>BEFORE ENTRY INTO FORCE, POST AGREES THAT THE GVN IS MAKING </p><p>A REAL EFFORT TO BRING THE NATION INTO COMPLETE COMPLIANCE </p><p>WITH ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) ADAMS AND MATIN ALSO AGREE THAT IN THE REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM\'S EARLY MONTHS (THE IMF PROGRAM WAS APPROVED IN </p><p>APRIL AND THE BANK PROGRAM IN JUNE), VIETNAM FELL SLIGHTLY </p><p>BEHIND ON BANKING REFORM.  THE DIFFICULTY HAD BEEN IN </p><p>GETTING THE GVN TO APPROVE CONTRACTS FOR OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT </p><p>BANKING AUDITS INTENDED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION NEEDED TO </p><p>PRODUCE DETAILED RESTRUCTURING PLANS FOR THE FOUR STATE </p><p>COMMERCIAL BANKS.  THESE WERE COMPLETED EARLIER THIS FALL </p><p>SOMEWHAT BEHIND SCHEDULE.  THE NEXT BIG CHALLENGE WILL BE TO </p><p>MEET YEAR-END DEADLINES ON LOAN CLASSIFICATION, E.G. ON </p><p>WHICH LOANS ARE NON-PERFORMING.  THE GVN HAS ASSURED THE </p><p>BANK AND THE FUND THAT IT WILL MEET THESE TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) BUT THE GREATEST DIFFICULTIES FOR THE GVN IN </p><p>MEETING ITS AGREED UPON TARGETS HAVE BEEN IN SOE REFORM.  IN </p><p>THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE POVERTY REDUCTION PROGRAMS, THE </p><p>GVN FELL SUBSTANTIALLY BEHIND.  AS A RESULT, FEWER FIRMS </p><p>WERE "EQUITIZED" (A TERM PREFERRED BY THE GVN TO </p><p>"PRIVATIZED") IN 2001 THAN IN 2000 OR 1999.  THE REASON, </p><p>MATIN SAYS, WAS THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP DID NOT </p><p>EXPLICITLY ENDORSE THE GOVERNMENT\'S PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE </p><p>SOE\'S AT THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS HELD APRIL 2001.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE PARTY DID FINALLY GIVE THE NEEDED ENDORSEMENT AT THE </p><p>PARTY PLENUM CALLED FOR THAT SPECIFIC PURPOSE IN AUGUST. </p><p>SINCE THAT TIME, SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN MOVING FORWARD ON </p><p>REFORM HAS BEEN MADE.  MATIN PREDICTS THAT THE GVN WILL BE </p><p>BACK ON TARGET IN THIS AREA BY THE END OF THE YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) COMMENT:  EVEN IF THE GVN STARTS MEETING ITS SOE </p><p>REFORM TARGETS ON TIME, THE FACT REMAINS THAT VIETNAM\'S SOE </p><p>REFORM PACKAGE IS MUCH LESS AMBITIOUS THAN MANY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS FELT WAS OPTIMAL.  FUND AND BANK </p><p>OFFICIALS GENERALLY AGREE WITH THIS VIEW.  BUT WHEN IT </p><p>BECAME CLEAR THAT LARGE-SCALE SOE PRIVATIZATION WAS NOT </p><p>POSSIBLE GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT\'S IDEOLOGY, THESE INSTITUTIONS </p><p>MADE THE STRATEGIC DECISION TO LOCK IN THE COMMITMENTS TO </p><p>SOE REFORM THAT THE GVN WAS WILLING TO MAKE BASED ON THE </p><p>FACT THAT SOE REFORMS WOULD BE REINFORCED AND, IN THEIR </p><p>VIEW, MADE MORE EFFECTIVE BY THE REFORMS AGREED TO IN TRADE, </p><p>BANKING, AND PUBLIC SECTOR FINANCE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) COMMENT CON\'T:  EQUALLY NECESSARY TO SUCCESSFUL </p><p>REFORM AND POVERTY REDUCTION IS FOCUS ON THE CONTINUED </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR.  A FLOURISHING </p><p>DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR IS NEEDED TO: CREATE GREATER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03054  02 OF 02  201049Z </p><p>DOMESTIC COMPETITION FOR SOES; GENERATE JOBS IN GENERAL AND </p><p>ALSO TO ABSORB THOSE MADE REDUNDANT BY DOWNSIZING OF THE SOE </p><p>WORKFORCE; AND BECOME THE ENGINE FOR THE FUTURE ECONOMIC </p><p>GROWTH TO LIFT VIETNAM\'S POOR OUT OF POVERTY.  WHILE THE </p><p>TERMS OF VIETNAM\'S POVERTY REDUCTION LOANS DO NOT CONTAIN </p><p>SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS TO DEVELOP THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THE </p><p>IMPERATIVE TO FOSTER PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH WAS THE </p><p>UNDERLYING LOGIC OF THE PACKAGE\'S DESIGN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) COMMENT CON\'T:  IT IS CLEAR THAT IF VIETNAM IS TO </p><p>MEET ITS OWN AMBITIOUS GOALS OF ELIMINATING POVERTY AND </p><p>JOINING THE RANKS OF THE WORLD\'S INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES BY </p><p>2020, THE GVN MUST DO MORE THAN JUST MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS </p><p>UNDER THE WORLD BANK, IMF AND BTA AGREEMENTS.  IT MUST PUT </p><p>ALSO PUT INCREASED EFFORT INTO ACTIVELY FOSTERING THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT.  THE GVN EXPENDS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>RESOURCES, BOTH ITS OWN AND THOSE OF BILATERAL AND </p><p>MULTILATERAL DONORS, DESIGNING LONG-TERM STRATEGIES AND </p><p>MEASURES TO REACH GOALS IN KEY ECONOMIC AREAS SUCH AS SOE </p><p>REFORM.  GIVEN THE INHERENT IMPORTANCE OF PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT TO VIETNAM\'S FUTURE, IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LEADERS (AND THOSE WHO ADVISE THEM) TO DIRECT THE </p><p>SAME LEVEL OF ENERGY AT THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  THE USG SHOULD </p><p>ENCOURAGE VIETNAM TO VIEW SOE REFORM AND PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AS TWO SIDES OF A SINGLE COIN, BOTH VITAL TO ITS </p><p>ECONOMIC FUTURE.  WE CAN BEGIN BY MAKING THIS A CENTRAL </p><p>THEME IN OUR STATEMENT FOR NEXT MONTH\'S CG MEETING IN HANOI. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03054  02 OF 02  201049Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
