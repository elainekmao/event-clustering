<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000992 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 06-09-13 </p><p>TAGS: CE, MV, AGMT, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 87  (06-09-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Lewis Amselem, Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  LATEST RE TOKYO </p><p> </p><p>LATEST RE TOKYO </p><p>--------------- </p><p>(C) Sri Lanka is relatively quiet today (June 9), with </p><p>precious little reaction just yet to the goings on at the </p><p>Tokyo donors conference.  We expect that reaction will </p><p>begin to flow in soon, as the speeches given and pledges </p><p>made at Tokyo net wider press play here.  (Note:  Re local </p><p>press reaction to events thus far, please see our media </p><p>reaction cables.)  In the meantime, we just wanted to flag </p><p>the following peace process-related issues: </p><p> </p><p>-- Chief Tiger Negotiator Anton Balasingham was quoted on </p><p>the pro-LTTE website "TamilNet" on June 6 as saying that </p><p>discussions re an interim structure in the north/east </p><p>could only proceed on the basis of "specific and </p><p>concrete" proposals from the GSL because "mere intent" </p><p>was not enough.  Balasingham\'s comments were clearly </p><p>foreshadowing Prime Minister Wickremesinghe\'s June 9 </p><p>remarks at Tokyo in which he promised to discuss forming </p><p>an interim structure with "significant" Tiger control. </p><p>(Note:  FYI.  The Ops Center called about all the wire </p><p>service stories highlighting the PM\'s June 9 comments re </p><p>an interim structure as some sort of dramatic development </p><p>that would change the situation here ipso facto.  We </p><p>provided the Ops Center the context, stressing that the PM </p><p>was indeed reaching out to the Tigers.  We noted, however, </p><p>that the key point was how the Tigers reacted to the offer </p><p>from this point forward and that based on Balasingham\'s </p><p>June 6 comments it was not clear whether a positive </p><p>response from the group was in the offing soon.  Our </p><p>comments to the Ops Center were cc\'ed to SA/INS.) </p><p> </p><p>-- According to press reports, a Buddhist religious </p><p>ceremony held in Tokyo June 8 in honor of the PM\'s visit </p><p>was marred by three young Sri Lankans creating a </p><p>commotion.  (Note:  It was not precisely clear whether the </p><p>PM was in attendance when this incident occurred.)  The </p><p>three suspects, described as "staying illegally" in </p><p>Japan, had alleged links to the radical Janantha Vimukthi </p><p>Peramuna (JVP).  The youths reportedly criticized the </p><p>peace process loudly and accused the temple leader of </p><p>taking one million rupees (approximately USD 10,000) from </p><p>the GSL.  The three men then reportedly tried to assault </p><p>some monks present at the ceremony.  The three are </p><p>reported to be currently enjoying the hospitality of a </p><p>Japanese jail, which probably does not involve a lot of </p><p>sushi and sake. </p><p> </p><p>-- Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is reportedly to </p><p>receive TIME Magazine\'s "Asian Hero" award on June 11 at </p><p>a ceremony in Japan.  In a press statement, TIME said the </p><p>PM was selected for "standing up to his President" in </p><p>regard to the peace process with the Tamil Tigers.  TIME </p><p>went on to state that its "Asian Heroes" exemplified </p><p>"extraordinary courage, charisma and genius" that </p><p>enabled winners to make a "big difference" in their </p><p>societies or fields.  (Note:  By the way, in addition to </p><p>Wickremesinghe, we understand that over 10 other well- </p><p>known Asians are receiving a similar award from TIME this </p><p>year.) </p><p> </p><p>-- And, in the back-at-home department, two people were </p><p>killed over the weekend in the eastern part of the </p><p>country.  In the first incident, which took place in </p><p>Batticaloa on June 6, a former member of the anti-LTTE </p><p>EPDP party and his 15-month old daughter were killed when </p><p>a grenade exploded.  In a second incident, unidentified </p><p>gunmen shot and killed an EPDP member on June 7 in </p><p>Trincomalee.  As with many such killings in past weeks </p><p>(see Colombo 735, for example), the Tigers seem to be the </p><p>culprits, though no one was caught and the group has not </p><p>taken credit.
