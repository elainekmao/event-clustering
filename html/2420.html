<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000402 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR T, PM/DCT, NP/ECNP. PM/RSAT </p><p>DOD FOR OSD:PDASD/S&TR, DUSD/TSP, DIR DTSA/ST & DTRSA/STP </p><p>DOD ALSO FOR USD(A&T)/ODUSD(I&CP) & USD(A&T)/IDA </p><p>USDOC FOR BXA/EA/OAS & BXA/EA/OSTFPC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/25/2007 </p><p></p><p>TAGS: AMGT, ETTC, IT, KSTC, PARM, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: WASSENAAR HOS: ITALY STILL MUMBLING BUT COMING </p><p>AROUND </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) MCBRIDE-VANSON 1/24 E-MAIL E (B) VIENNA 92 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECMIN MARGARET DEAN; REASON 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p> 1. (SBU)  UGO DE MOHR, MFA\'S NONPROLIFERATION COORDINATOR, </p><p>GAVE HIS VIEW OF THE STATE OF PLAY OF THE WASSENAAR HEAD OF </p><p>SECRETARIAT ISSUE DURING A JANUARY 24 MEETING WITH ECONOFF. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HE SEES, OR AT LEAST COUCHES, THE SITUATION IN PROCEDURAL </p><p>TERMS: THE DECEMBER PLENARY HAVING ENDED WITHOUT SELECTION OF </p><p>A HOS, THE PROCESS HAS TO START OVER; THE UKRAINE CHAIR </p><p>SHOULD CALL FOR NOMINATIONS; THERE SHOULD BE AN EXTRAORDINARY </p><p>SESSION TO ELECT A SUCCESSOR, PERHAPS IN MAY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) DE MOHR SAID ITALY WOULD NOT FIELD A CANDIDATE FOR </p><p>THE JOB.  ON THE SWEDISH CANDIDACY, HE DOESN\'T SEE ANY </p><p>QUESTION OF BLOCKAGE.  IF THE SWEDE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE, HE </p><p>EXPLAINED, ITALY WOULD NOT OPPOSE HIM.   ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>HE HAS ALREADY HEARD RUMORS THAT ANOTHER CANDIDATE (HE </p><p>THOUGHT MAYBE A SLOVAK) WOULD JUMP INTO THE RACE WHEN </p><p>NOMINATIONS ARE OPENED.  IF THERE IS ANOTHER CANDIDACY, HE </p><p>SAID WOULD LIKELY VIEW IT IN THE CONTEXT OF "THE POLICY OF </p><p>GEOGRAPHIC ROTATION.  AFTER ALL WE CAN\'T HAVE SUCH A POLICY </p><p>ON MONDAY AND THEN SAY ON WEDNESDAY IT NO LONGER APPLIES." </p><p>(NOTE.  DURING THE CONTROVERSY OVER LAURIOLA\'S CANDIDACY FOR </p><p>A NEW HOS TERM, DE MOHR INSISTED THAT SELECTION OF A SWEDE </p><p>WOULD VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLE BECAUSE A SWEDE WAS ACTING HOS </p><p>BEFORE LAURIOLA.  END NOTE.) </p><p></p><p>3. (C) COMMENT.  ALTHOUGH DE MOHR WAS HIS USUAL COOPERATIVE </p><p>SELF ON THE SEVERAL OTHER ITEMS ON YESTERDAY\'S MEETING </p><p>AGENDA, HE MADE CLEAR THAT THE LAURIOLA EPISODE STILL </p><p>RANKLES.   WHEN THE GLOVES CAME OFF DURING THAT DECEMBER </p><p>CONFRONTATION, DE MOHR UNDERSTOOD CLEARLY THAT OUR OPPOSITION </p><p>TO LAURIOLA DID NOT STEM SOLELY FROM A USG PREFERENCE FOR THE </p><p>ROTATION OF MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATION LEADERSHIP.  HIS </p><p>ELEVATION OF THAT PREFERENCE TO AN OSTENSIBLE WASSENNAR </p><p>PRINCIPLE AND INDICATION THAT ITALY MAY TROT IT OUT IN </p><p>COUNTERATTACK TO THE SWEDISH CANDIDACY CLEARLY SHOWS HIS </p><p>BITTERNESS.  SINCE DE MOHR RUNS A ONE-OFFICER SHOP, WE DON\'T </p><p>YET KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE GOI SHARES HIS PIQUE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH DE MOHR FAVORS A DELIBERATE CALL FOR NOMINATIONS AND </p><p>A VOTE NEXT SPRING, A CLEAR INDICATION THAT NO OTHER </p><p>CANDIDATES, SLOVAK OR OTHERWISE, ARE IN THE OFFING MAY HELP </p><p>US CONVINCE THE GOI, AT A PAYGRADE ABOVE DE MOHR\'S, TO ALLOW </p><p>ACCELERATION OF THE ELECTION PROCESS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
