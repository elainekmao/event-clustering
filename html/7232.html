END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. News Stories: A senior American official told Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam that American interrogators ask all Iraqi POWs about the </p><p>whereabouts of Kuwaiti POWs. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report on April 7 that the Criminal Court has </p><p>begun deliberation on the case of Sami Al-Mutairi, the man </p><p>who confessed to killing an American civilian contractor in </p><p>an ambush on January 21. </p><p> </p><p>Kuwait has sent 32 trucks to Al-Najaf loaded with 18,000 </p><p>cartons of water, 121,000 meals, 10,000 blankets and </p><p>medicine supplies as part of Kuwaiti humanitarian assistance </p><p>to the Iraqi people, all newspapers report. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan reports that a number of Kuwaiti families prepared </p><p>packages filled with chocolate, sweets and non-food supplies </p><p>to be presented to American soldiers in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that Kuwait invited GCC foreign ministers </p><p>for an emergency meeting in Kuwait on April 7 to discuss </p><p>developments in the region. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports on April 6 that the Kuwait stock exchange </p><p>has reached record levels for the second time this week. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports on its front page on April 6 the </p><p>denial by Sheikh Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmad of rumors of the </p><p>death of the Amir. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "The People of Al-Najaf Defeated America" </p><p>Abdelatif Al-Duaij wrote in independent Al-Qabas (4/5): </p><p>"The image of American soldiers retreating from Al-Najaf </p><p>must remain in the Arab and Muslim memory. The people of Al- </p><p>Najaf practiced their right of rejection that led the </p><p>American forces to retreat in respect of the people\'s will. </p><p>Later, the people of Al-Najaf welcomed the American forces </p><p>when they realized that they were not against the Iraqis, </p><p>but rather are there to confront the tyrant. This is </p><p>democracy. The people of Al-Najaf did not throw stones at </p><p>the Americans, and the Americans did not fire a bullet. The </p><p>American soldiers expressed their respect for the holy </p><p>sites. [W]hen will the Arabs defend their holy sites, </p><p>instead of defending their dictators?" </p><p> </p><p>4.  Conservative Dr. Sami Khalifa wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Rai Al-Aam (4/5): "In light of the marginalization of the </p><p>Iraqi opposition, the targeting of Iraq\'s infrastructure and </p><p>the suffering of the Iraqi people. [w]e have no other choice </p><p>but to ally ourselves with the other Arab and Muslim nations </p><p>to condemn American insensitivity for practicing this </p><p>scorched earth policy before toppling the Iraqi regime." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Who to Believe?" </p><p>Ahmad Al-Dayeen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (4/6): </p><p>"[British Prime Minister] Blair stated that the UN will play </p><p>a major role in the reconstruction of Iraq, while we heard </p><p>the Deputy US Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz state that </p><p>the UN could play the role of facilitator. [W]e notice that </p><p>there is a discrepancy between the two countries, and that </p><p>leads me to wonder who to believe?" </p><p> </p><p>6.  "A Peaceful Word in a Boiling Street" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief, Jassim Boodai, wrote in independent Al-Rai </p><p>Al-Aam (4/3): "Arabs and Muslims have the right to </p><p>demonstrate against the strikes on Iraqi civilians and </p><p>against American double-standard policies. The Arab Street </p><p>has the right to refuse to believe the Americans who started </p><p>their campaign by eliminating Iraq\'s WMDs, and proceeded to </p><p>develop their goals to eliminate the Iraqi regime, then to </p><p>remove national governance of Iraq after toppling the regime </p><p>and replacing it with an American military governor. The </p><p>American\'s final step is to obliterate all maps of the </p><p>region by announcing the planning of a new Middle East. The </p><p>turmoil in the seething of the Arab Streets is justified, </p><p>but the split of tracks between reality and slogans only </p><p>serves the US in the long run. We have to say a peaceful </p><p>word to a boiling street.  Help the Iraqis and do not help </p><p>their regime. Help the Iraqis establish a democratic </p><p>national system free of WMDs and foreign military presence. </p><p>As for what is taking place now, it only serves the current </p><p>Iraqi regime and the coming American military presence." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "When Will Al-Sahaf Admit Defeat?" </p><p>Lawyer Jamal Al-Kandari wrote in independent Al-Watan (4/6): </p><p>"Today\'s war is different from previous wars. Television </p><p>correspondents today are in the heart of the battlefield. </p><p>They monitor and report every movement of the [American] </p><p>army. [Iraqi Minister of Information] Al-Sahaf denies much </p><p>of this news. When the coalition forces took Umm Qasr, he </p><p>stated that the city is resisting.  The same scenario </p><p>happened in Al-Basra and other cities and places.  Al-Sahaf </p><p>will continue his denials and lies until the day the </p><p>[coalition] forces reach him and take him to Guantanamo </p><p>Bay." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
