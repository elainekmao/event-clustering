(C)  SUMMARY:  GVN ACTIONS HINDERED CONTACT </p><p>BETWEEN RELIGIOUS LEADERS IT DID NOT HAND PICK AND THE </p><p>U.S. COMMISSION FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\'S </p><p>(USCIRF) DELEGATION.  CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING A </p><p>PACKED ITINERARY, SELECTIVE COMPLIANCE WITH SCHEDULE </p><p>CHANGE REQUESTS, PLAINCLOTHES TAILS, AND POORLY </p><p>EXPLAINED DETOURS, COMBINED TO MAKE UNOFFICIAL </p><p>MEETINGS DIFFICULT.  THE GVN\'S ESSENTIALLY UNDISGUISED </p><p>EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE DELEGATION LEFT A WORSE </p><p>IMPRESSION OF VIETNAM THAN THE CONTENTS OF THE </p><p>MEETINGS THE GVN SEEMS TO HAVE FEARED SO MUCH.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PLAYING GAMES WITH THE SCHEDULE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  DESPITE USCIRF REQUESTS IN WRITING, SENT </p><p>BEFORE THE DELEGATION LEFT THE UNITED STATES, THEIR </p><p>VIETNAMESE HOSTS, THE VIETNAM - USA SOCIETY, AN OFFICE </p><p>OF THE VIETNAM UNION OF FRIENDSHIP ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>(VUFO), REFUSED TO ELIMINATE ANY OF THE 26 ENGAGEMENTS </p><p>IT SCHEDULED OVER FIVE DAYS.  VUFO ALSO REBUFFED A </p><p>SERIES OF ORAL REQUESTS TO STREAMLINE THE SCHEDULE </p><p>MADE BY THE DELEGATION, POLOFF, AND (SEPTEL) CONGEN </p><p>POLOFF.  ON FEBRUARY 22, TRAN VAN DANG, GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE VIETNAM FATHERLAND FRONT, VUFO\'S </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PARENT ORGANIZATION, "CONGRATULATED" THE DELEGATION ON </p><p>ITS "ABUNDANT" SCHEDULE, BUT SAID THAT IT WOULD BE TOO </p><p>COMPLICATED TO CHANGE.  LATER, IN AN ASIDE TO POLOFF, </p><p>THE DELEGATION\'S HOST, HOANG CONG THUY, GENERAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00579  01 OF 02  140555Z </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE VIETNAM - USA SOCIETY, SAID THAT HIS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BOSS HAD TOLD HIM THERE COULD BE NO CHANGES.  VUFO DID </p><p>COMPLY WITH AN EARLY REQUEST THAT THE DELEGATION TRIED </p><p>TO REVERSE AFTER IT REALIZED THAT THE CHANGE MEANT AT </p><p>LEAST TWO HOURS OF EXTRA TRAVEL TIME.  VUFO REFUSED TO </p><p>REVERSE THE CHANGE, DESPITE CONGENOFF\'S OFFER TO MAKE </p><p>THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS.  CONFRONTED WITH THIS </p><p>INTRACTABLE SCHEDULE, THE DELEGATION DECIDED IT WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO SPLIT UP TO MEET INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE ITS </p><p>OFFICIAL SCHEDULE AT THE SAME TIME AS OFFICIAL </p><p>MEETINGS.  THEY ALSO DECIDED TO SIMPLY REFUSE TO </p><p>ATTEND EVENTS THEY HAD ASKED VUFO TO CANCEL. </p><p> </p><p>MOTORBIKE TAILS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE DELEGATION HAD TWO UNOFFICIAL MEETINGS </p><p>(SEPTEL/REF D) IN HANOI, BUT PLAINCLOTHESMEN ON </p><p>MOTORBIKES FOLLOWED THE DELEGATION\'S EMBASSY VEHICLE </p><p>TO BOTH.  THE FIRST MEETING, ON FEBRUARY 21, WAS AT </p><p>ONE PILLAR PAGODA NEAR HO CHI MINH\'S MAUSOLEUM.  TWO </p><p>PLAINCLOTHESMEN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR MOTORBIKES AND </p><p>FOLLOWED THE DELEGATION AND ACCOMPANYING EMBOFFS ONTO </p><p>THE PAGODA\'S GROUNDS ON FOOT.  THE DELEGATION SPOKE </p><p>WITH A MONK IN ONE OF THE PAGODA\'S PUBLIC ROOMS FOR </p><p>ABOUT AN HOUR.  EACH PLAINCLOTHESMEN CAME IN ONCE FOR </p><p>A FEW MINUTES AT A TIME, OSTENSIBLY TO PRAY AND MAKE </p><p>AN OFFERING WHILE STANDING CLOSE ENOUGH TO EAVESDROP </p><p>EASILY.
