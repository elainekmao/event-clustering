(C) POLOFF CONTACTED PAOLA IMPERIALE, MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR </p><p>FOR EAST AFRICAN AFFAIRS, ON MAY 24 TO INQUIRE ABOUT REF </p><p>REPORT OF COL. ABDULLAHI YUSUF AHMAD SAYING THAT PUNTLAND HAD </p><p>BEEN PROMISED MILITARY ASSISTANCE BY UGANDA, ETHIOPIA, AND </p><p>ITALY.  IMPERIALE STATED THAT THE GOI HAD NOT OFFERED ANY </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO PUNTLAND.  AHMAD HAD WRITTEN A LETTER TO THE </p><p>GOI REQUESTING AID FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES AND HAD NOT YET </p><p>RECEIVED A RESPONSE.  HOWEVER, THE GOI WOULD HAVE TO REPLY IN </p><p>THE NEGATIVE, SINCE PUNTLAND\'S PRIORITIES WERE NOT COVERED BY </p><p>THE GOI\'S FOREIGN AID LAW. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON THE OTHER HAND, THE GOI WAS PREPARED TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS FINANCIALLY.  IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST BY </p><p>KENYA\'S SPECIAL ENVOY FOR SOMALIA, THE GOI HAD DECIDED TO </p><p>PROVIDE UP TO 100,000E FOR TRAVEL TO NAIROBI BY THE MEDIATION </p><p>COMMITTEE OF FRONT-LINE STATES.  FURTHERMORE, THE GOI </p><p>EXPECTED KENYA TO ASK THE IGAD PARTNERS\' FORUM TO PAY FOR </p><p>ACCOMMODATIONS FOR DELEGATES TO THE PEACE CONFERENCE, PLANNED </p><p>FOR JULY 10 IN NAIROBI.  THE GOI WOULD CONSIDER THIS REQUEST </p><p>FAVORABLY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IMPERIALE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO ETHIOPIA </p><p>WITH SENATOR RINO SERRI, THE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02602  291334Z </p><p>PRESIDENCY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE ETHIOPIA-ERITREA </p><p>CONFLICT.  THEY SPOKE WITH ETHIOPIAN PRESIDENT MELES ABOUT </p><p>HIS 23-PAGE LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOUNDARY </p><p>COMMISSION REQUESTING CLARIFICATIONS ON THE DECISION.  MELES </p><p>DESCRIBED THE LETTER AS A LEGAL, NOT POLITICAL, MATTER. </p><p>POLITICALLY, THE VERDICT WAS FINAL AND BINDING, BUT UNMEE </p><p>SHOULD STAY UNTIL THE LAST DEMARCATION MARKER WAS PLACED. </p><p>IMPERIALE\'S VIEW WAS THAT MELES WAS TAKING THIS STANCE MOSTLY </p><p>IN ORDER TO SPITE ERITREA, WHICH SOUGHT A SPEEDY DEMARCATION </p><p>AND THE DEPARTURE OF UNMEE. </p><p>POPE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02602 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
