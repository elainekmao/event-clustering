<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001420 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/IL(WHITE); LABOR FOR BRUMFIELD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT SYMPOSIUM: "RESTRUCTURING THE CIVIL SERVICE" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Prime Minister Abdullah Gul opened a two-day </p><p>symposium Feb. 22-23 to support civil service reform. </p><p>Turkish academics and union leaders participated on panels </p><p>reviewing the cultural, economic and legal barriers to </p><p>revising the Turkish civil service and suggested possible </p><p>changes, but did not offer action programs.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Gul opened the symposium by noting it "was not </p><p>possible to administer a country efficiently with a classic </p><p>understanding of a civil servant."  Gul stated that his </p><p>government was exerting serious initiatives on public </p><p>management reform; a bill on the issue would be submitted to </p><p>Parliament.  Academics offered analyses of new approaches, </p><p>privatization, flexible employment, wages, career planning </p><p>and social impact.  Each session, except for one presented by </p><p>labor leaders on social issues was attended by a capacity </p><p>audience at the Ankara Hilton ballroom. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- European Institute of Public Administration human resource </p><p>specialist Sean Fitzpatrick gave the keynote speech.  Drawing </p><p>upon thirty years of experience as an Irish civil servant, </p><p>Fitzpatrick focused on the demand today for civil service </p><p>management to get things done in comparison to the "old style </p><p>bureaucracy" which emphasized inputs rather than results and </p><p>explained that accountability is an important issue for tax </p><p>paying publics today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Professor Umit Bergman stressed that reforming the Turkish </p><p>civil service to make it compatible with European Union </p><p>practices is an important issue as the EU considers Turkey\'s </p><p>candidacy.  He commented that it is a given there will be </p><p>social costs to pay for civil service reform, especially as </p><p>Turkish society will have to decrease its dependence on the </p><p>country\'s extensive social services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Istanbul Teknik University Associate Professor Kadriye </p><p>Bakirci noted that reform of the civil service is expected to </p><p>cause an increase in unemployment as well as political </p><p>dissatisfaction. The speaker observed that Turkey\'s </p><p>increasing population growth is already causing higher levels </p><p>of unemployment, making reform especially important. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Attendance at the trade union segment, the last </p><p>session on Sunday afternoon, was sparse.  At the conclusion </p><p>of each union leader\'s presentation, a group would clap </p><p>enthusiastically and then leave the auditorium, until at the </p><p>end of the union program, only one-quarter of the seats in </p><p>the ballroom remained occupied, compared to the full house </p><p>attendance of the previous sessions.  It was during the labor </p><p>union session that one of the speakers urged the attendees to </p><p>not support Turkey\'s involvement with a possible war with </p><p>Iraq, and accused the US of working against Turkey\'s </p><p>interests by initiating a war, as well as being responsible </p><p>for IMF-imposed reforms.  After applauding the speaker </p><p>loudly, his constituent group walked out en masse as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) For all the activity, presenters avoided discussing </p><p>specific, comprehensive civil service reform programs or </p><p>cost/benefit analyses -- in effect, talking about talking </p><p>about reform.  The EU is planning to revive an initiative to </p><p>assist the GOT with civil service reform as part of Turkey\'s </p><p>EU accession bid. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
