<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000099 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (U) POLITICAL BATTLE HIGHLIGHTS CORRUPTION, STIRS </p><p>DISSOLUTION RUMORS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: In yet another round of anti-government </p><p>political fighting, MP Abdullah Mohammed Al-Naibari has </p><p>submitted a request to conduct a parliamentary investigation, </p><p>or "grilling," into the activities of a government minister. </p><p>The threat of a grilling has fueled rumors that the Amir may </p><p>be considering the dissolution of the National Assembly. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Less than three weeks after Minister of Electricity, </p><p>Water, Social Affairs and Labor, Talal al-Ayyar successfully </p><p>defended himself against accusations of widespread but </p><p>ill-defined corruption, MP Abdullah Mohammed al-Naibari has </p><p>accused Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for </p><p>Cabinet and National Assembly Affairs Mohammed Sharar of </p><p>being partially responsible for the illegal sale of 64 square </p><p>kilometers of government land, popularly known as the Khairan </p><p>Pearls Project, and has submitted a formal request to "grill" </p><p>him in the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>The Pearls Project </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Al-Khairan city project, or Pearls Project, is an </p><p>initiative to develop three planned cities on public lands on </p><p>Kuwait,s southern coast.  Originally conceived in 1987 by </p><p>Kuwaiti entrepreneur Mr. Khaled Marzouk, the project was </p><p>approved by the Council of Ministers without the input and </p><p>review of government agencies on January 15, 1989.  In 1993, </p><p>the Council of Ministers concluded a sales agreement with Mr. </p><p>Marzouk\'s company, the Kuwait Pearls Real Estate Company, </p><p>agreeing to sell it 600 million square meters of property for </p><p>Kuwaiti Dinars (KD) 400,000 (USD 1.32 million, at today,s </p><p>exchange rate, or approximately $3.3 to KD 1).  After drawing </p><p>criticism when the agreement was publicized, the government </p><p>revised the terms.  Finally, on August 13, 2002, the Council </p><p>of Ministers approved the sale to Kuwait Pearls Real Estate </p><p>Company of 64 million square meters of public lands at a </p><p>price, depending on the source, of between KD 0.002 and 0.007 </p><p>(0.6 - 2.3 cents) per square meter. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On January 11, al-Naibari submitted his three-part </p><p>formal grilling request to the National Assembly.  Although </p><p>the request includes other corruption charges, the Pearls </p><p>Project charges are the most substantial.  In the request, </p><p>al-Naibari accuses the GOK of violating the constitution </p><p>through the sale of public lands, and attacks it for not </p><p>having opened the proposed sale to competitors, as required </p><p>by law.  According to Naibari, the Kuwait Pearls Real Estate </p><p>Company is charging KD 70,000 for a plot of land that cost </p><p>them KD 10.  He estimates the company will have earned KD 4 </p><p>billion (USD 13.2 billion) from the al-Khairan project by the </p><p>year 2019. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) This request for a grilling has sparked widespread </p><p>speculation among Kuwaitis that the Amir may dissolve the </p><p>National Assembly, though First Deputy Prime Minister and </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah </p><p>denies the rumors.  If the grilling occurs, it will be the </p><p>fourth time for the current government. (Comment: In the </p><p>current political climate, in which many are calling for </p><p>national unity in the face of a possible war with Iraq, a </p><p>dissolution would be an easy way for the government to gain </p><p>short-term freedom of action.  However, the repercussions </p><p>could be severe.  The Amir has dissolved the Assembly before, </p><p>most notably in 1986, when it remained dissolved until after </p><p>the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.  Dissolution would be </p><p>widely interprested as a sign the regime is not committed to </p><p>democracy.  Given the large and growing U.S. military </p><p>presence in Kuwait, if the Assembly were dissolved it would </p><p>be widely assumed that the USG had given at least a tacit </p><p>greenlight.  This would be sure to generate accusations of </p><p>U.S. interference and failure to adhere to our own professed </p><p>ideals.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The National Assembly is currently scheduled to take </p><p>up action on al-Naibari,s request on January 13; an </p><p>automatic two-week postponement is the most likely outcome. </p><p>Post will continue to monitor the situation and report on </p><p>further developments. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
