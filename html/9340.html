<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 003178 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEFENSE FOR U/S WYNNE (ACQUISITIONS); </p><p>COMMERCE FOR BIS U/S JUSTER; </p><p>USDOC 4220/MAC/EUR/DDEFALCO; </p><p>STATE FOR PM DAS MAGGI AND FOR T; </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PARM, PREL, IT, EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN INDUSTRY MINISTRY HOPES TO EASE TECH </p><p>TRANSFER RULES AT JULY 22 TALKS; AIRS COMPLAINTS ABOUT </p><p>LOCKHEED-MARTIN </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Scott Kilner for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  On July 8, Ministry of Productive Activities </p><p>(MPA, i.e. Industry) U/S Mario Valducci met with ECMIN to </p><p>discuss the possibility of easing U.S. export controls on </p><p>technology to Italy, in the context of Italy\'s strong </p><p>political support for the U.S., particularly during the </p><p>recent Iraq war.  Valducci also aired complaints about </p><p>Lockheed-Martin.  He noted that, during his June visit to </p><p>Washington, he had made similar requests of DOD U/S Wynne, </p><p>Commerce U/S Juster and State U/S Bolton. Valducci believed </p><p>that he had been received with understanding in Washington </p><p>and had established a political level dialogue that would </p><p>lead to the transfer of more sophisticated technology to </p><p>Italy.  The planned July 22-23 visit of State DAS Turk Maggi </p><p>to Rome, said Valducci, would permit more in-depth </p><p>discussions and, he anticipated, significant progress toward </p><p>greater/improved tech transfer.  Valducci planned to present </p><p>Maggi with a list of 22 technologies, which the Government of </p><p>Italy would request be transferred in the near future.  ECMIN </p><p>explained the genesis of the Maggi delegation visit and </p><p>stressed the limited focus on dual-use export controls.  He </p><p>also explained the complexities of the USG interagency </p><p>process.  Nevertheless, post believes that Valducci and </p><p>perhaps others in the GOI have unreasonably high expectations </p><p>for Maggi\'s visit and the July 22-23 talks.  We would suggest </p><p>planning for side discussions with Valducci on this issue, </p><p>perhaps on July 21.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) U/S Valducci (Ministry of Productive Activities) met </p><p>with ECMIN and other Mission officers, including the Acting </p><p>Chief of the Office of Defence Cooperation, on July 8. </p><p>Valducci was joined by DG Goti, Deputy DG Cuzzoni, Dip </p><p>Advisor Checchia, and Chief of Staff Raimondi.   Valducci had </p><p>requested the meeting to follow up on his meetings during his </p><p>June visit to Washington. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Valducci explained that Italy had long been an </p><p>extremely close U.S. ally.  During the recent Iraq war, the </p><p>Berlusconi government had faced down political and public </p><p>opposition in order to support the U.S.  Italy\'s EU partners </p><p>continually complained that Italy too often chose U.S. rather </p><p>than EU weapons systems.   The decision to pull out of the </p><p>A400M program, as well as other pro-U.S. choices, has meant </p><p>increasing pressure from France and other EU  states.  Yet </p><p>the GOI felt it had not received credit for this from the </p><p>USG.   Italy saw itself left out of the top echelon of allies </p><p>in terms of technology transfer.  The French, Cuzzoni </p><p>alleged, were given access to U.S. technologies denied to </p><p>Italy.  All Italy was asking, he said, was to be treated as </p><p>well as America\'s other major European allies.   At the </p><p>moment, the French were beginning a major new program (NFI), </p><p>and pressing the Italians to enter.  Italy would prefer to </p><p>work with the U.S., but found itself treated as an outsider. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Valducci recounted that he had visited Washington in </p><p>June, and met with U/S Wynne of DOD, U/S Juster of DOC and </p><p>U/S Bolton of State.  He had also met with Rep. Curt Weldon, </p><p>House Appropriations Committee Chairman Young and Sen. Ted </p><p>Stevens.  These meetings had given Valducci an opportunity to </p><p>explain Italy\'s need for increased technology transfer from </p><p>the U.S.   Valducci felt that he had been heard and </p><p>understood, and that he had established a political dialogue </p><p>that would result in an easing of export controls on </p><p>technology transfer to Italy.  He noted that U/S Bolton had </p><p>mentioned legal restrictions, but Valducci believed that </p><p>these could be resolved via a high level political agreement. </p><p> The next step, he argued, would be the visit of State DAS </p><p>Turk Maggi to Rome on July 22-23 for bilateral discussions. </p><p> Valducci would participate in the MFA discussions and </p><p>planned also to meet separately with Maggi to discuss the </p><p>transfer of 22 specific technologies.  A list would be </p><p>provided to Maggi.   (Note:  Embassy requested a copy of the </p><p>list at the meeting, but has not received it.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DG Goti asked whether DAS Maggi could personally </p><p>approve the transfer of such technologies to Italy.  ECMIN </p><p>responded that the system was far more complicated.   While </p><p>Maggi was a key person for the State Department, the export </p><p>control process included several departments.  Moreover, the </p><p>U.S. did not have category A, B, or C allies, each of which </p><p> </p><p>was approved access to broad categories of specified </p><p>technologies.  Rather, specific requests were treated on a </p><p>case-by-case basis, depending on how the narrowly defined </p><p>technology was to be used, whether it might be re-exported </p><p>and many other criteria.   The most successful strategy for </p><p>Italy would be to take one specific case at a time and </p><p>request approval through proper channels, rather than making </p><p>a wholesale request. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Goti responded that he was willing to explain to </p><p>Maggi GOI intentions for all 22 technologies, and accept his </p><p>limitations on the use and/or re-export of each.  The </p><p>important thing, stressed Goti, was to get all 22 </p><p>technologies quickly -- not in three or four years, when it </p><p>would be too late.  (Comment: The MPA, on behalf of Italian </p><p>industry, appears to be looking for a political level </p><p>agreement that would significantly streamline procedures and </p><p>shorten the time frame associated with individual tech </p><p>transfers.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ECMIN reiterated that a broad request was unlikely to </p><p>be approved.  He clarified for Valducci that the July 22-23 </p><p>meetings at the MFA had been set up for a different -- albeit </p><p>related -- purpose.  The discussions had arisen out of </p><p>concerns expressed by the USG regarding some sensitive </p><p>exports to third countries, especially China.  These </p><p>discussions are an effort to establish a transparent and open </p><p>dialogue between our two governments on how export controls </p><p>are applied and how we can work together.  If we can move </p><p>toward a common understanding on how to deal with sensitive </p><p>technologies, this would be an important first step toward </p><p>closer defense-industrial cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Valducci went on to explain that, in discussions with </p><p>Rep. Weldon, a proposal had emerged for a two-day U.S./Italy </p><p>aerospace workshop in Washington in the fall of 2003 or </p><p>spring of 2004.  All Italian defense companies would be </p><p>represented, and it would allow Italy to show that -- aside </p><p>from close political ties -- Italy cooperates closely with </p><p>the U.S. in defense and industrial areas.   ECMIN asked if </p><p>this proposal had been discussed with any of the Executive </p><p>Branch officials he had met. Valducci thought not.  He </p><p>believed, however, that Ambassador Vento had discussed it </p><p>with U/S Bolton in recent days.  Valducci added that the </p><p>workshop had the support of the Italian defense and research </p><p>ministers. </p><p> </p><p>Lockheed Martin and JSF </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The other issue raised by Valducci during this meeting </p><p>was his sense that Lockheed Martin had not met Italy\'s </p><p>expectations as a partner in JSF or in earlier projects. </p><p>While Boeing had been an excellent partner and met all its </p><p>commitments, LM had continually disappointed the GOI. </p><p>Valducci referred to the C27J program, arguing that LM had </p><p>done nothing to sell the product, leaving Italy to do it all. </p><p> Italy hoped to sell the C27Js to the Coast Guard deep water </p><p>program or to the U.S. national guard, but nothing was </p><p>concluded.  LM was late on meeting its offset commitments for </p><p>the C130J program.  The offset was to be 50 percent over 14 </p><p>years, but LM had only complied with 33 percent to date. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Italy was committed to JSF, stressed Valducci.  As a </p><p>level two partner, the GOI was putting one billion dollars </p><p>into the program, and saw itself as a real partner in this </p><p>effort.  However, LM didn\'t seem to have the same view.  LM, </p><p>he charged, did not seem at all interested in using Italian </p><p>industry in the JSF program, despite early promises.  While </p><p>countries such as Canada, that would not even commit to </p><p>buying JSF, had reportedly earned a 67 percent return on </p><p>investment, and the Netherlands had reportedly gotten 45-50 </p><p>percent return, Italy had seen no more than a 24 percent </p><p>return.  Of course, noted Valducci, these figures were press </p><p>reports, because LM does not provide any information to the </p><p>Ministry of Productive Activities.  (Note:  LM deals only </p><p>with the Ministry of Defense on JSF, at the insistence of the </p><p>National Armaments Director Adm. Di Paola.) </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Valducci and Cuzzoni both emphasized that Italy was </p><p>coming close to another key decision point on JSF </p><p>participation (not further identified), and that LM\'s </p><p>disappointing performance might be a factor in this decision. </p><p> </p><p>  While Adm. Di Paola had, according to Goti, persuaded LM to </p><p>promise some additional contracts would be given to Italian </p><p>firms, no results had yet been seen.  Goti added that "We </p><p>want to continue with JSF and with the United States.  Help </p><p>us to help you."  He asked that the USG press LM to treat </p><p>Italian firms more fairly. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  We have found that GOI officials in other Italain </p><p>ministries (MFA, MOD and MOI, as well as some in the MPA) </p><p>have a more realistic understanding of U.S. tech </p><p>transfer/export control processes than that expressed by </p><p>Valducci.  Despite our efforts to dampen expectations, </p><p>Valducci (perhaps under the influence of para-statal </p><p>Finmeccanica -- septel) appears to maintain unrealistic views </p><p>regarding the Maggi visit and the July 22-23 discussions.  We </p><p>recommend that DAS Maggi consider separate meetings at the </p><p>MPA. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) On the JSF/Lockheed issue, the MPA will have a major </p><p>voice in any new funding decisions for JSF, as does Adm. Di </p><p>Paola.  The JSF program decision to give certain sole source </p><p>contracts to strategic partners, including Italy, may be a </p><p>first step in meeting the GOI\'s concerns.  However, the total </p><p>lack of contact between LM and the MPA on JSF has caused a </p><p>shaky relationship to deteriorate further.  The Embassy will </p><p>work to provide reliable and complete information on the JSF </p><p>program to MPA officials as they evaluate their next steps. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03178 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
