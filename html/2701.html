IN HER MARCH 31 STATEMENT, THE MFA </p><p>SPOKESPERSON SAID THAT ANY "MIGRANTS" WHO WISH TO RESETTLE </p><p>IN A THIRD COUNTRY WOULD BE "ASSISTED WITH THE NECESSARY </p><p>FORMALITIES, FOLLOWING PREVIOUS PATTERNS OF COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN THE UNHCR, VIETNAM AND OTHER RELATED COUNTRIES." </p><p>THOSE WHO WANT TO REPATRIATE TO VIETNAM WILL BE ALLOWED TO </p><p>DO SO UNDER A "COOPERATIVE PROCEDURE" BETWEEN VIETNAM, </p><p>CAMBODIA, AND THE UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p>2.
