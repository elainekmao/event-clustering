<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIRUT 005863 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE; LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p>ROME PLEASE PASS TO VATICAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PREL, PHUM, KISL, KPRP, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  (S)ELECTING A LEBANESE PRESIDENT IN 1995: A </p><p>CURTAIN-RAISER </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  VIRTUALLY EVERY PROMINENT MARONITE POLITICAN </p><p>IN LEBANON (AND IN PARIS) HOPES TO SUCCEED PRESIDENT </p><p>HRAWI, WHOSE TERM IS SET TO EXPIRE IN NOVEMBER 1995. </p><p>FURIOUS JOCKEYING HAS BEGUN, AND A DIZZYING ARRAY OF </p><p>POSSIBLE SCENARIOS EXISTS, BEGINNING WITH AN EXTENSION OF </p><p>HRAWI\'S TERM.  THE FATE OF THE PEACE PROCESS IS WIDELY </p><p>VIEWED AS A KEY DETERMINING FACTOR.  THE LEBANESE </p><p>HISTORICAL REFLEX TO SEEK FOREIGN BACKERS WILL MARK THE </p><p>1995 PROCESS: SYRIA WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER, BUT </p><p>CANDIDATES ARE ALSO SEEKING U.S., FRENCH, SAUDI, AND </p><p>VATICAN SUPPORT.  AS OF NOW, HRAWI, LAF COMMANDER EMILE </p><p>LAHOUD, AND FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. NASSIB LAHOUD </p><p>ARE THE FRONT-RUNNERS.  THE PRINCIPAL USG INTEREST SHOULD </p><p>BE IN URGING THE SELECTION OF A PRESIDENT WITH </p><p>ACROSS-THE-BOARD CREDIBILITY, BUT IN PARTICULAR WHO CAN </p><p>HELP STEER THE MARONITES TOWARD POSITIVE PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>FORMAL POLITICAL LIFE.  SEPTEL REPORT WILL "HANDICAP" THE </p><p>MOST PROMINENT CONTENDERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A PRESIDENT IN EVERY MARONITE\'S MIRROR </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE SIX-YEAR TERM OF ILYAS HRAWI IS SLATED TO EXPIRE </p><p>IN NOVEMBER 1995, AT WHICH TIME PARLIAMENT WILL SELECT A </p><p>SUCCESSOR.  SHI\'I NABIH BERRI AND SUNNI RAFIQ HARIRI BOTH </p><p>HOPE ONE DAY TO BE THE FIRST MUSLIM PRESIDENT OF LEBANON, </p><p>BUT NOBODY PREDICTS THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE </p><p>ANYTHING OTHER THAN A MARONITE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS IN THE </p><p>MARONITE COMMUNITY.  AT A RECENT SOCIAL EVENT FOR </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS, A DRUZE MP ILLUSTRATED THE POINT WHEN HE </p><p>TOASTED "TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT IN OUR MIDST--ALL SIX OF </p><p>THEM."  THE LIST OF MARONITE "WANNABES" BRIDGES THE GAP </p><p>BETWEEN THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 1992 ELECTIONS AND </p><p>THOSE WHO BOYCOTTED THE PROCESS, AND RUNS THE SPECTRUM </p><p>FROM VIRULENT ANTI-SYRIANS TO THE SHAMELESS SURROGATES OF </p><p>DAMASCUS.  IN ADDITION TO THE SURFEIT OF WOULD-BE LEADERS </p><p>IN THE COUNTRY, SUCH EXILES IN PARIS AS RAYMOND EDDE, </p><p>AMINE GEMAYEL, AND MICHEL AOUN WANT TO EITHER GAIN THE </p><p>PRIZE OR PLAY KINGMAKER. </p><p> </p><p>THE SYRIAN ROLE, AS USUAL, KEY </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  REGIONAL REALITIES AND THE PRESENCE OF A PRO-SYRIAN </p><p>MAJORITY IN THE LEBANESE PARLIAMENT ASSURE THAT SYRIA WILL </p><p>HAVE THE DOMINANT VOICE IN THE SELECTION OF A NEW </p><p>PRESIDENT.  TO DATE, THE SARG HAS NOT TIPPED ITS HAND </p><p>ABOUT ITS PREFERENCES.  IN LEBANON, IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION WILL BE CLOSELY TIED TO THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS, AND THAT THE SARG WILL CALCULATE ITS INTERESTS AS </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL PLAY THEMSELVES OUT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  EVEN THE MARONITES NOW JOCKEYING FOR POSITION BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE SYRIAN STRATEGY WILL BE TO LET THE CANDIDATES </p><p>STRATCH, JOSTLE, AND ELBOW EACH OTHER TO THE POINT OF </p><p>IMPASSE, AT WHICH POINT "BIG BROTHER" WILL STEP IN TO </p><p>"HELP" THE LEBANESE SORT OUT THEIR SELF-MADE MESS.  IN THE </p><p>MEANTIME, DAMASCUS WILL HOST A CONSTANT STREAM OF </p><p>CANDIDATES WHO SALLY ACROSS THE BORDER IN HOPE THAT ASAD </p><p>WILL GIVE A FAVORABLE WORD, WINK, OR NOD. </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. ROLE: DIFFERENT SCENARIOS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  IT IS AXIOMATIC AMONG LEBANESE THAT THE USG WILL PLAY </p><p>A KEY ROLE, EITHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, IN THE MAKING OF THE </p><p>NEXT PRESIDENT.  USG DRUTHERS ARE JUDGED TO BE DEPENDENT </p><p>ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. </p><p>PLANS TO "SELL OUT" LEBANON FOR THE SAKE OF A </p><p>SYRIAN-ISRAELI PEACE AGREEMENT FEAR THAT THE SARG AND THE </p><p>USG WILL COOPERATE TO CREATE A LEBANESE QUISLING WHO WILL </p><p>FAITHFULLY EXECUTE SYRIAN DIKTAT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  A MORE POSITIVE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT BELIEVES THAT THE </p><p>USG, AT AN APPROPRIATE MOMENT, SHOULD URGE THE SARG TO </p><p>EXERCISE ITS INFLUENCE TO GUARANTEE THE SELECTION OF A </p><p>PRESIDENT WHO HAS A DEGREE OF CREDIBILITY ON ALL SIDES. </p><p>THEY HOPE THAT DAMASCUS WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY BROAD-MINDED </p><p>TO SEE THE NEED FOR A UNIFYING FIGURE, IN PARTICULAR </p><p>SOMEONE WHO CAN LEAD THE MARONITES TOWARD POSITIVE </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN FORMAL POLITICAL LIFE.  SUCH SYRIAN </p><p>ALTRUISM, HOWEVER, WOULD IN THEIR ESTIMATION BE DEPENDENT </p><p>ON A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE MARONITE HARD CORE HOPES THAT A BREAKDOWN OF THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS WILL SOMEHOW LEAD THE USG (AND ISRAEL) TO </p><p>SUPPORT A VOCAL OPPONENT OF SYRIA.  THEY HOPE TO MOBILIZE </p><p>MARONITE COMMUNITIES IN THE U.S. TO PRESSURE THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION TO SUPPORT "THE LEBANESE POWER OF DECISION" </p><p>-- WHICH IN THEIR CIRCLES MEANS RESTORING UNRIVALED </p><p>MARONITE DOMINANCE. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER PLAYERS: FRANCE, SAUDI ARABIA, THE VATICAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>10.  MANY MARONITES ARE HOPING THAT FRANCE WILL INVOLVE </p><p>ITSELF IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE BY URGING SYRIA OR THE USG </p><p>IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION, OR, IN SOME FEVERED IMAGININGS, </p><p>BY RESUMING THE ROLE OF GUARANTOR OF MARONITE POWER. </p><p>THOSE MARONITES WHO MAKE THE PILGRIMAGE TO FOGGY BOTTOM </p><p>SEEKING USG BLESSING USUALLY STOP OFF IN PARIS TO </p><p>PRACTICE THEIR PITCH.  THEORIES OF FRENCH PREFERENCES VARY </p><p>WILDLY -- FROM BACKING AOUN AND "MARONISME" TO SELLING OUT </p><p>CHRISTIAN INTERESTS FOR THE SAKE OF CEMENTING WIDER FRENCH </p><p>INTERESTS IN THE ARAB WORLD.  IN PARTICULAR, MANY </p><p>MARONITES FEAR THE WARM RELATIONS BETWEEN JACQUES CHIRAC </p><p>AND SUNNI PRIME MINISTER HARIRI. </p><p> </p><p>11.  SAUDI ARABIA IS ALSO SEEN AS HAVING A ROLE TO PLAY, </p><p>BUILDING ON ITS EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH HARIRI.  SOME </p><p>SPECULATE THAT RIYADH WILL POUR MONEY INTO LEBANON -- OR </p><p>EVEN SYRIA -- TO SUPPORT HARIRI\'S FAVORITE MARONITE, OR </p><p>THAT, CONVERSELY, HARIRI WILL BE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS WHOM </p><p>TO SUPPORT.  MOREOVER, ONE PROMINENT CANDIDATE, NASSIB </p><p>LAHOUD, HAS INDEPENDENT TIES TO RIYADH (SEPTEL).  SOME </p><p>EXPECT THE USG TO URGE THE SAUDIS TO SUPPORT ITS FAVORED </p><p>CANDIDATE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  PUNDITS EXPECT THAT THE VATICAN, THROUGH THE </p><p>INFLUENCE IT MIGHT EXERCISE ON THE MARONITE PATRIARCH AND </p><p>THUS HIS CHURCH, WILL INVOLVE ITSELF DEEPLY.  THEY SEE THE </p><p>ELEVATION OF PATRIARCH SFAYR TO CARDINAL AS A SIGN OF </p><p>VATICAN INTEREST IN GUARDING CHRISTIAN "RIGHTS."  THE HARD </p><p>CORE HOPES THAT THE POPE WILL PRESSURE THE USG AND FRANCE </p><p>TO SUPPORT A "NATIONALIST"; MODERATES HOPE THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN WILL STRONGLY URGE MARONITES TO PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>POLITICAL LIFE; SOME BELIEVE THAT PAPAL NUNCIO PUENTE\'S </p><p>ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH HIZBALLAH LEADER FADLALLAH WILL HELP </p><p>PRODUCE A PRESIDENT WITH BROAD CREDIBILITY.  PUENTE SAYS </p><p>THAT, HEALTH PERMITTING, THE POPE WILL VISIT LEBANON IF A </p><p>PEACE AGREEMENT IS REACHED: IF THE VISIT HAPPENS, LOCAL </p><p>EARS WILL BE KEEN TO SIGNALS OF A VATICAN PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>PREFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>THE MUSLIM CONTRIBUTION </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  MOST PRESIDENTIAL MANEUVERING, OF COURSE, IS A </p><p>STRICTLY MARONITE GAME.  MUSLIMS--SHIA, SUNNI, AND </p><p>DRUZE--ARE RELEGATED TO SECONDARY ROLES:  EITHER TO BE THE </p><p>GREEK CHORUS IN PARLIAMENT TO ECHO THE WISDOM RECEIVED </p><p>FROM DAMASCUS, AND/OR TO STRIKE DEALS WITH MARONITE </p><p>HOPEFULS TO OBTAIN THE POSITIONS TO WHICH MUSLIMS AT THIS </p><p>POINT CAN ASPIRE.  MUSLIM LEADERS ALREADY HAVE BEGUN </p><p>CAUTIOUSLY TO ALIGN THEMSELVES, AS OFTEN AGAINST AS FOR A </p><p>PARTICULAR MARONITE.  UNTIL NOW, THE HIZBALLAH SHI\'A HAVE </p><p>NOT DISCUSSED THE RACE OPENLY: INSTEAD, THEY ARE </p><p>PREOCCUPIED WITH WHAT SYRIA, AND PERHAPS IRAN, HAVE IN </p><p>STORE FOR THEM AFTER PEACE WITH ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>EXTENSION FOR HRAWI? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION OF </p><p>A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW PRESIDENT </p><p>HRAWI TO EXTEND HIS TERM BY PERHAPS TWO YEARS.  DESPITE </p><p>PUBLIC DISAVOWAL OF THE IDEA, HRAWI IS WORKING TOWARD THIS </p><p>GOAL BEHIND THE SCENES.  HE APPARENTLY WANTS TO BE SEEN AS </p><p>THE PRESIDENT WHO TOOK OFFICE IN THE MIDST OF TURMOIL, </p><p>THEN PRESIDED OVER A PERIOD IN WHICH LEBANON ENDED ITS </p><p>CIVIL WAR, MADE PEACE WITH ISRAEL, THEN PUT ITSELF ON THE </p><p>PATH TO ECONOMIC REVIVAL.  WE HAVE ALSO DETECTED WHAT MAY </p><p>BE A NASCENT EFFORT BY HRAWI TO BOOST HIS DOMESTIC </p><p>CREDIBILITY BY PUTTING A BIT OF DAYLIGHT BETWEEN HIMSELF </p><p>AND DAMASCUS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE LEBANESE SAY THAT THE SYRIANS HAVE SENT </p><p>CONFLICTING SIGNALS ON THE ISSUE OF EXTENSION, AND THAT </p><p>THE ISSUE MAY DEPEND ON THE FATE OF THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>THE THINKING IS THAT, IF THE PROCESS STALLS, HRAWI WOULD </p><p>REMAIN IN OFFICE, AND THE QUESTION OF THE PRESIDENCY, LIKE </p><p>SO MANY OTHER ISSUES, WOULD REMAIN BLOCKED UNTIL THE SHAPE </p><p>OF REGIONAL POLITICS BECAME CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THERE ARE CONFLICTING REPORTS ON HOW PM HARIRI, </p><p>SPEAKER BERRI, AND OTHER GOL FIGURES VIEW AN EXTENSION OF </p><p>HRAWI.  HARIRI AND BERRI DISLIKE HRAWI, BUT FEAR THAT A </p><p>NEW, STRONGER PRESIDENT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE PREROGATIVES </p><p>THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARVE OUT.  PREDICTABLY, TO THE </p><p>EXTENT THAT AN EXTENSION OF HRAWI WOULD ALSO HELP FREEZE </p><p>THEM IN PLACE, THE IDEA IS ATTRACTIVE.  IN THE ULTIMATE </p><p>ANALYSIS, THEY WILL WAIT FOR SYRIA\'S DEFINITIVE SIGNAL ON </p><p>THE ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>17.  INTERESTINGLY, THERE ARE VIRULENT OPPONENTS OF BOTH </p><p>HRAWI AND SYRIA WHO SUPPORT AN EXTENSION.  THEIR THINKING </p><p>IS THAT THE ENEMIES OF SYRIA SHOULD CONCENTRATE THEIR </p><p>EFFORTS ON THE 1996 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, SEEKING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND GUARANTEES.  THE NEW, </p><p>PRESUMABLY LESS SYRIAN-INFLUENCED PARLIAMENT WOULD THEN </p><p>ELECT A PRESIDENT UNDER LESS SYRIAN SWAY. </p><p> </p><p>THE USG INTEREST </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  THE USG\'S VERY ACTIVE, UNSUCCESSFUL SUPPORT IN 1988 </p><p>FOR MIKHAEL DAHER PROVIDES A CAUTIONARY LESSON FOR THE </p><p>1995 PRESIDENTIAL SELECTION PROCESS.  ACTIVE USG BACKING </p><p>FOR A PARTICULAR CANDIDATE WOULD PROBABLY SET IN MOTION A </p><p>SERIES OF REACTIONS THAT WOULD DAMAGE THE CHANCES OF </p><p>"AMERICA\'S CHOICE."  THAT SAID, IT WOULD BE ALMOST </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE USG TO KEEP SILENT ABOUT THE SELECTION </p><p>PROCESS: IF EXTENSION OF HRAWI REMAINS A LIVE ISSUE, WE </p><p>WILL BE ASKED AT LEAST FOR COMMENT.  IF A NEW PRESIDENT IS </p><p>TO BE CHOSEN, WE WILL BE ASKED FOR OUR INPUT EVERY STEP OF </p><p>THE WAY.  PRESUMABLY, AT A MINIMUM, WE WOULD LIKE TO </p><p>ASSURE THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT IS NOT HOSTILE TO USG </p><p>INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>19.  UP TO THIS POINT, EMBASSY HAS ANSWERED INQUIRIES BY </p><p>AVOIDING NAMES AND SAYING THAT WE HOPE A NEW PRESIDENT </p><p>WILL FIT A CERTAIN PROFILE:  HE/SHE SHOULD BE DEDICATED TO </p><p>FINDING WAYS TO RECONCILE THE VARIOUS LEBANESE COMMUNITIES </p><p>WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE NEEDS OF THE COMING ERA OF </p><p>PEACE.  HE/SHE SHOULD HAVE CREDIBILITY WITH ALL SIDES, AND </p><p>IN THIS SENSE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS OVERLY TIED TO ANY </p><p>FOREIGN SPONSOR.  HE/SHE SHOULD ALSO VIEW AS A PRINCIPAL </p><p>TASK ENCOURAGING THE MARONITES TOWARD MORE ACTIVE, </p><p>POSITIVE PARTICIPATION IN FORMAL LEBANESE POLITICAL LIFE. </p><p>IF THE TREND TOWARD CHRISTIAN NON-PARTICIPATION CONTINUES </p><p>OR DEEPENS, THE PROSPECTS FOR INTERNAL RECONCILIATION AND </p><p>STABILITY--WITHIN AND PERHAPS EVEN BEYOND LEBANON\'S </p><p>BORDERS--ARE POOR. </p><p> </p><p>SCHLICHER </p><p></p></div>
