Summary </p><p> </p><p>While Burma is the world\'s second largest producer of illicit </p><p>opium, its overall production in 2002 was actually only a </p><p>fraction of its production in the mid-1990s.  According to </p><p>the joint U.S./Burma opium yield survey, opium production in </p><p>Burma totaled no more than 630 metric tons in 2001, down more </p><p>than 26 percent from a year earlier, and less than </p><p>one-quarter of the 2,560 metric tons produced in Burma in </p><p>1996. </p><p> </p><p>Over the past several years, the Burmese government has </p><p>significantly extended its counternarcotics cooperation with </p><p>other states.  In 2001, it signed counternarcotics MOUs with </p><p>both China and Thailand, and, in both 2001 and 2002, joined </p><p>with China in joint operations in northern and eastern Shan </p><p>State which resulted in the destruction of several major drug </p><p>trafficking rings, including one group which the Chinese </p><p>called one of the largest "armed drug smuggling groups in the </p><p>Golden Triangle area."  Cooperation with Thailand was </p><p>interrupted by tensions on the border during the summer of </p><p>2002, but has been revived as tensions have eased. </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, Burma also responded to rising international </p><p>concerns regarding the quality of its anti-money laundering </p><p>regime by enacting a powerful new money-laundering law that </p><p>criminalizes money laundering in connection with virtually </p><p>every type of major criminal activity.  The first </p><p>investigations under this law began in July, resulting in the </p><p>seizure of several hundred thousand dollars in assets. </p><p> </p><p>Burma is a party to the 1961 UN Single Convention, the 1971 </p><p>UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 UN </p><p>Drug Convention.  It has also announced that it will shortly </p><p>adhere to the 1972 Protocol to the 1961 Single Convention. </p><p> </p><p>II. Status of Country </p><p> </p><p>Burma is the world\'s second largest producer of illicit </p><p>opium.  However, its overall production in 2001 was actually </p><p>only a fraction of its production in the mid-1990s. </p><p>According to the joint U.S./Burma opium yield survey, opium </p><p>production in Burma totaled no more than 630 metric tons in </p><p>2002, down 26 percent from a year earlier, and less than </p><p>one-quarter of the 2,560 metric tons produced in Burma in </p><p>1996. Approximately half of this decline reflects a decline </p><p>in acreage under cultivation (which dropped by more than half </p><p>to only 78,000 hectares in 2002).  The remainder was due to </p><p>lower yields (now only about 8 kilograms/hectare) throughout </p><p>Burma. </p><p> </p><p>Burma also plays a role in the regional traffic in </p><p>amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  Drug gangs based in the </p><p>Burma/China and Burma/Thailand border areas annually produce </p><p>several hundred million methamphetamine tablets for markets </p><p>in Thailand, China, and other Southeast Asian states on the </p><p>basis of precursors imported from neighboring states.  Burma </p><p>itself does not have a chemical industry and does not produce </p><p>any of the precursors for methamphetamine or other artificial </p><p>drugs.  Neither is there any significant market in Burma for </p><p>ATS. </p><p> </p><p>Burma has a small, but growing drug abuse problem.  While the </p><p>government maintains that there are only about 70,000 </p><p>registered addicts in Burma, surveys conducted by UNDCP, </p><p>among others, suggest that the addict population could be as </p><p>high as 300,000 (i.e., still less than 1 percent of the </p><p>population), with opium the major source of addiction.  There </p><p>is also a growing HIV/AIDS epidemic, linked in part to </p><p>intravenous drug use.  According to surveys, 57 percent of </p><p>all intravenous drug users in Burma have tested positive for </p><p>the HIV/AIDS virus. </p><p> </p><p>Money-laundering is also an area of concern.  While </p><p>international money flows through Burma are small, given the </p><p>undeveloped state of its banking system and tight government </p><p>controls on all funds transfers, the Financial Action Task </p><p>Force in June 2001 placed Burma on its list of </p><p>non-cooperating territories, because of concerns regarding </p><p>weaknesses in Burma\'s anti-money laundering regime.  Burma </p><p>has since responded by enacting a powerful new money </p><p>laundering law, seizing assets, and preparing prosecutions in </p><p>several major cases. </p><p> </p><p>III. Country Actions Against Drugs </p><p> </p><p>A. Policy Initiatives </p><p> </p><p>Burma\'s official counternarcotics plan calls for the </p><p>eradication of all narcotics production and trafficking over </p><p>a fifteen year period, starting in 1999.  The plan is to </p><p>proceed by stages, with eradication efforts coupled to </p><p>alternative development programs in individual townships, </p><p>predominantly in Shan State.  Altogether, 54 townships have </p><p>been targeted, 25 of which are to be taken on during the </p><p>first five years of the program. </p><p> </p><p>The government has received very limited international </p><p>assistance in support of these efforts.  The most significant </p><p>is UNDCP\'s Wa Alternative Development Project (WADP) which is </p><p>financed by the United States, Japan and, since 2002, </p><p>Germany.  A five-year, $12.1 million program, this project </p><p>encourages alternative development in a small portion of the </p><p>territory controlled by the United Wa State Army.  There is </p><p>also a small, U.S.-financed project in Northern Shan State </p><p>(Project Old Soldier) and a Japanese effort to establish </p><p>buckwheat as a cash crop in the Kokang and Mong Ko regions of </p><p>northeastern Shan State.  In addition, the Thai government </p><p>agreed in 2001 to extend its own alternative development </p><p>projects across the border into the Wa-controlled Southern </p><p>Military Region of Shan State. </p><p> </p><p>B. Accomplishments </p><p> </p><p>Narcotics Seizures: Summary statistics provided by the </p><p>Burmese police indicate that the Burmese police, army, and </p><p>the Customs Service together seized approximately 1,631 </p><p>kilograms of raw opium, 285 kilograms of heroin, and 8.8 </p><p>million methamphetamine pills during the first ten months of </p><p>2002.  This compares with seizures of 1,629 kilograms of raw </p><p>opium, 97 kilograms of heroin, and 32 million methamphetamine </p><p>pills during all of 2000.  Major cases included the following: </p><p> </p><p>--    In cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement </p><p>Administration and the Australian Federal Police, Burmese </p><p>police contributed to the seizure of 357 kilograms of heroin </p><p>in Fiji in October 2000.  Death sentences were eventually </p><p>handed down in Yangon for two drug kingpins connected with </p><p>this case. </p><p> </p><p>--    In cooperation with Thailand, Burmese police </p><p>contributed to the seizure of 116 kilograms of heroin and 7.8 </p><p>million methamphetamine tablets in February 2002.  Two of the </p><p>principals behind this shipment were also eventually </p><p>convicted in Yangon and sentenced to "indefinite" (i.e., </p><p>unending) terms in prison. </p><p> </p><p>--    In cooperation with China, Burmese police have </p><p>contributed to a series of arrests and seizures throughout </p><p>2001 and 2002 all along the Chinese border.  Altogether, </p><p>Burma has turned over 22 fugitives to China, including </p><p>members of one group (Tan Xiao Lin and company) which China </p><p>described as the "largest armed drug-trafficking gang in the </p><p>Golden Triangle." </p><p>--    In cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement </p><p>Administration and China, Burmese police contributed to the </p><p>seizure of 12.5 kilograms of heroin in Hong Kong on July 11, </p><p>2002.   Evidence collected in that case will provide the </p><p>basis for one of the first prosecutions in Burma under the </p><p>GOB\'s new money laundering law. </p><p> </p><p>--    In cooperation with Thailand and the U.S. Drug </p><p>Enforcement Administration, Burmese police arrested Yang </p><p>Chia-ho, a Kokang Chinese who is reportedly a confederate of </p><p>the notorious Wa captain, Wei Hsueh Kang.  Yang Chia-ho was </p><p>taken into custody together with more than 5 million </p><p>methamphetamine tablets and 41 kilos of heroin in Tachileik, </p><p>Burma on October 4, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Arrests and Prosecutions: Over the past fourteen years, the </p><p>Burmese government has made almost 90,000 arrests on </p><p>drug-related charges.  Of those arrested, 42 were eventually </p><p>sentenced to death, 37 were given life imprisonment, and an </p><p>additional 12,500 were given prison terms of more than 10 </p><p>years.  During the first eight months of 2002, Burma has </p><p>arrested another 4,148 suspects.  It has also continued with </p><p>prosecutions.  Altogether, the Burmese government has brought </p><p>more than 4,000 separate cases against narcotics traffickers </p><p>over the past two years; 2,592 of these cases were prosecuted </p><p>in 2001; 1,475 during the first seven months of 2002.  Of </p><p>these cases, 172 were dismissed for lack of sufficient </p><p>evidence and 259 defendants were acquitted.  The remainder (a </p><p>total of 3,853 over the full nineteen months) were convicted. </p><p> Six were given the death penalty; 137 were given "unlimited" </p><p>sentences; 10 were given life sentences; and 1,927 were given </p><p>sentences in excess of 10 years.  The remainder were given </p><p>sentences of less than 10 years. </p><p> </p><p>Refineries:  The GOB destroyed 14 heroin labs in 2001 and 7 </p><p>through the first nine months of 2002.  It has also destroyed </p><p>6 meth labs during the first nine months of 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Precursor Chemicals:  In 2002, the Ministry of Health issued </p><p>notification No. 1/2002 identifying 25 substances as </p><p>precursor chemicals and prohibiting their import, sale, or </p><p>use in Burma.  Seizures of precursor chemicals during the </p><p>first nine months of 2002 included 1,220 kilos of ephedrine, </p><p>2,908 kilos of acetic anhydride, and 21,552 kilos of other </p><p>chemicals.  In 2001, the totals were 3,922 kilos of </p><p>ephedrine, 12,318 liters of acetic anhydride, and 174,191 </p><p>liters of other chemicals. </p><p> </p><p>Eradication: The GOB eradicated more than 50,000 acres of </p><p>opium poppy over the past two crop years.  Of this, 26,113 </p><p>acres were destroyed during the 2000/01 crop year; 25,862 </p><p>acres during 2001/02.  In addition, the GOB burned 164,000 </p><p>kilos of poppy seeds capable of seeding more than 40,000 </p><p>hectares during the six month period between April and </p><p>October 2002.  According to the Burmese government, the </p><p>destruction of those seeds, together with law enforcement </p><p>actions is expected to reduce the acreage under opium </p><p>cultivation by about half in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>C. Law Enforcement Measures </p><p> </p><p>Drug-enforcement efforts in Burma are led by the Central </p><p>Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), which is comprised </p><p>of personnel from various security services, including the </p><p>police, customs, military intelligence, and the army.  CCDAC </p><p>now has 18 drug-enforcement task forces around the country, </p><p>with most located in major cities and along key transit </p><p>routes near Burma\'s borders with China, India, and Thailand. </p><p>As is the case with most Burmese government entities, CCDAC </p><p>suffers badly from a lack of adequate resources to support </p><p>its law-enforcement mission. </p><p> </p><p>The legal framework for Burma\'s law enforcement efforts is </p><p>provided by its 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic </p><p>Substances Law.  As demanded by the 1988 UN Drug Convention, </p><p>that law contains legal tools for addressing money </p><p>laundering, the seizure of drug-related assets, and the </p><p>prosecution of drug conspiracy cases. </p><p> </p><p>Burma was placed on the Financial Action Task Force\'s list of </p><p>non-cooperating territories in June 2001 because of </p><p>continuing deficiencies in its anti-money laundering regime. </p><p>In response, the GOB enacted a powerful new money laundering </p><p>law in 2002 which criminalized money laundering in connection </p><p>with most major offenses.  A Central Control Board chaired by </p><p>the Minister of Home Affairs was established in July; </p><p>training for financial investigators was conducted in Rangoon </p><p>and Mandalay in August and September; the initial </p><p>investigations were begun in July; and, using the provisions </p><p>of the law, assets have been frozen and/or seized in several </p><p>major narcotics-related cases.  The first prosecutions under </p><p>the new law should take place within the next several months. </p><p> With assistance from UNDCP, the Burmese government is also </p><p>in the process of drafting a new mutual legal assistance law, </p><p>which should lay the groundwork for judicial and law </p><p>enforcement cooperation across borders in the prosecution of </p><p>money laundering and other cases. </p><p> </p><p>In 2000 and 2001, the Burmese government also launched its </p><p>first major campaigns against trafficking by former insurgent </p><p>groups.  In November 2000, the GOB took advantage of a mutiny </p><p>within the Mong Ko Defense Army to seize Mong Ko and put that </p><p>band and its leader, Mong Sa La, out of the narcotics </p><p>business.  It also sharply stepped up its pressure on the </p><p>Kokang Chinese, who missed their year 2000 target for </p><p>establishing an "opium free" zone throughout their </p><p>self-administered territories.  Starting in September 2001, </p><p>the Burmese joined with the Chinese government in a series of </p><p>joint operations which resulted in the destruction of heroin </p><p>factories and meth labs throughout the Kokang Chinese Special </p><p>Region No. 1 and the arrest of major traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>In 2001, for the first time, the government also established </p><p>a police and military intelligence presence in the Wa </p><p>territories. In March, 2002, it demanded that new </p><p>counternarcotics decrees be issued by the Wa, the Kokang </p><p>Chinese, and other cease-fire groups.  Those decrees outlawed </p><p>participation in any aspect of the narcotics trade.  In April </p><p>and May 2002, the GOB also demanded and received cooperation </p><p>from the United Wa State Army in bringing to heel several </p><p>major fugitives wanted by China.  In addition, it has closed </p><p>down the liaison offices of armed groups like the United Wa </p><p>State Army, and of companies associated with those groups in </p><p>Tachileik, Myawaddy, and other towns on the Thai/Burmese </p><p>border.  Finally, the GOB continued efforts to hold </p><p>cease-fire groups to their pledges to end opium production in </p><p>their territories.  U Sai Lin\'s Special Region No. 4 around </p><p>Mong La has been opium-free since 1997 and the Wa are, thus </p><p>far, on track to eliminate opium by 2005.  The Kokang Chinese </p><p>missed their opium-free target (scheduled for the year 2000), </p><p>but have paid a heavy price for that failure in terms of </p><p>increased attention from both the Burmese and the Chinese </p><p>police. </p><p>In 2001, the GOB also began a crackdown on the array of </p><p>militias (some government-sponsored Ka Kwe Ye; i.e., village </p><p>defense forces, and others the remnants of former insurgent </p><p>bands) that the GOB had previously allowed to cultivate opium </p><p>in the Kutkai-Lashio region of northern Shan State. </p><p>According to military intelligence officials, with peace now </p><p>prevailing in most of the countryside and the government no </p><p>longer in need of the local security services these groups </p><p>provided, steps are now being taken to slowly claw back their </p><p>privileges, including the right to grow and traffic opium. </p><p> </p><p>D. Corruption </p><p> </p><p>There is no evidence that the Burmese Government is directly </p><p>involved in the drug trade.  However, officials, particularly </p><p>army and police personnel posted in outlying areas, have been </p><p>prosecuted for drug abuse and/or narcotics-related </p><p>corruption.  According to the Burmese government, over 200 </p><p>police officials and 48 Burmese Army personnel have been </p><p>punished for narcotics-related corruption or drug abuse </p><p>between 1995 and May 2002.  Of the 200 police officers, 130 </p><p>were imprisoned, 16 were dismissed from the service, 7 were </p><p>forced to retire, and 47 were demoted. </p><p> </p><p>E. Agreements and Treaties </p><p> </p><p>Burma is a party to the 1961 UN Single Convention, the 1971 </p><p>UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 UN </p><p>Drug Convention.  It has also announced that it will shortly </p><p>adhere to the 1972 Protocol to the 1961 Single Convention. </p><p>In addition, is also one of six nations (Burma, Cambodia, </p><p>China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam) that are parties to UNDCP\'s </p><p>sub-regional action plan for controlling precursor chemicals </p><p>and reducing illicit narcotics production and trafficking in </p><p>the highlands of Southeast Asia. The GOB has signed bilateral </p><p>drug control agreements with India in 1993, with Bangladesh </p><p>in 1994, with Vietnam in 1995, and with the Russian </p><p>Federation, Laos, and the Philippines in 1997. </p><p> </p><p>Burma is part of every major multilateral narcotics control </p><p>program in the region.  In November 2001, Burma agreed to </p><p>contribute to the ACCORD plan of action, which serves as an </p><p>umbrella for a variety of global programs aimed at </p><p>strengthening the rule of law, promoting alternative </p><p>development, and increasing civic awareness of the dangers of </p><p>drugs.  It has also supported the 1993 Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding that was signed among the six regional states </p><p>-- Burma, China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia -- to </p><p>control narcotics production in Southeast Asia. </p><p> </p><p>In 2001, Burma signed additional counternarcotics MOUs with </p><p>China (in January) and Thailand (in June).  The MOU with </p><p>China, in particular, laid down the ground rules for joint </p><p>operations, which in turn led to a series of arrests and </p><p>renditions of major traffickers during the spring and summer </p><p>of 2001 (see below). </p><p> </p><p>Burma\'s MOU with Thailand commits both countries to closer </p><p>police cooperation in narcotics control.  In August 2001, </p><p>both countries also agreed to establish joint "narcotics </p><p>suppression coordination stations" in the Chiang </p><p>Rai/Tachileik, Mae Sot/Myawaddy, and Ranong/Kawthoung border </p><p>areas.  In addition, during Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt\'s </p><p>September visit to Thailand, Thailand also offered 20 million </p><p>baht (about $440,000) for the establishment of a new </p><p>alternative development program in the Southern Military </p><p>Region of Shan State, which is now occupied by the United Wa </p><p>State Army. </p><p> </p><p>This nascent counter-narcotics cooperation between Thailand </p><p>and Burma was interrupted by tensions on the border during </p><p>the summer of 2002.  However, as tensions have eased, </p><p>cooperation has resumed. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, Burma has continued its operational cooperation with </p><p>DEA, the Australian Federal Police, and other western and </p><p>regional police agencies.  In April, that cooperation </p><p>resulted in the arrest of two Burmese citizens who were </p><p>accused of exporting 357 kilograms of heroin to Fiji (see </p><p>above).  Both have since been tried, convicted, and sentenced </p><p>to death. </p><p> </p><p>F. Cultivation and Production </p><p> </p><p>According to the US/Burma Joint Opium Yield Survey, opium </p><p>production declined in Burma for the sixth straight year in </p><p>2002. The survey found that the maximum potential yield for </p><p>opium in Burma in 2002 totaled only 630 metric tons, down 235 </p><p>metric tons (or approximately 26 percent) from 2001. Over the </p><p>past six years, opium production in Burma has declined by </p><p>more than 75 percent, from an estimated 2,560 metric tons in </p><p>1996 to only 630 metric tons in 2002.  The area under </p><p>cultivation has dropped by more than half, from 163,100 </p><p>hectares in 1996 to approximately 78,000 acres in 2002. </p><p>Yields have similarly been cut by more than half, from an </p><p>estimated 17 kilograms per hectare in 1996 to levels (about </p><p>8.0 kilograms per hectare in 2001) that are now comparable to </p><p>those in neighboring states such as Laos. </p><p> </p><p>Results from a UNDCP-sponsored census survey throughout Shan </p><p>State in 2002 largely corroborated these results. According </p><p>to UNDCP, Burma produced approximately 828 metric tons of </p><p>opium on 81,000 hectares of land in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>G. Drug Flow/Transit </p><p> </p><p>Most ATS and heroin in Burma is produced in small, mobile </p><p>labs located in the Burma/China and Burma/Thailand border </p><p>areas, primarily in territories controlled by active or </p><p>former insurgent groups.  A growing amount of methamphetamine </p><p>is reportedly produced in labs co-located with heroin </p><p>refineries in areas controlled by the United Wa State Army, </p><p>the Kokang Chinese, and the Shan State Army - South.  Heroin </p><p>and methamphetamine produced by these groups are trafficked </p><p>primarily through China, Thailand and, to a lesser extent, </p><p>Laos, India, Bangladesh, and Burma itself. </p><p> </p><p>Precursors for the trade are primarily produced in India, </p><p>China, Thailand, and other regional states.  Burma does not </p><p>have a chemical industry and does not produce ephedrine, </p><p>acetic anhydride, or any of the other chemicals required for </p><p>the narcotics trade.  Similarly, the major markets for all of </p><p>these narcotic drugs lie in neighboring states.  Relatively </p><p>little is sold in Burma itself. </p><p>H. Demand reduction </p><p> </p><p>The overall level of drug abuse is low in Burma compared with </p><p>neighboring countries.  According to the GOB, there are only </p><p>about 70,000 "officially registered" drug abusers in Burma. </p><p>While this is undoubtedly an underestimate, even UNDCP </p><p>estimates that there may be no more than 300,000 people </p><p>(still less than 1 percent of the population) who abuse drugs </p><p>in Burma.  Most, particularly among the older generation, use </p><p>opium, but use of heroin and synthetic drugs is rising, </p><p>particularly in urban and mining areas. </p><p> </p><p>Burmese demand reduction programs are in part coercive and in </p><p>part voluntary.  Addicts are required to register and can be </p><p>prosecuted if they fail to register and accept treatment. </p><p>Altogether, more 21,000 addicts were prosecuted for failing </p><p>to register between 1994 and April 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Demand reduction programs and facilities are strictly </p><p>limited, however.  There are six major drug treatment centers </p><p>under the Ministry of Health, 49 other smaller detox centers, </p><p>and 8 rehabilitation centers which, together, have reportedly </p><p>provided treatment to about 55,000 addicts over the past 9 </p><p>years.  There are also a variety of narcotics awareness </p><p>programs conducted through the public school system. </p><p>According to UNDCP, approximately 1,200 high school teachers </p><p>participated in seminars, training programs, and workshops </p><p>connected with these programs in 2001.  In addition, the </p><p>government has established demand reduction programs in </p><p>cooperation with INGOs.  These include programs with CARE </p><p>Myanmar, World Concern, and Population Services </p><p>International, all of which focus on injecting drug use as a </p><p>factor in the spread of HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>IV.  U.S. Policy Initiatives </p><p> </p><p>A.    Policy and Programs </p><p> </p><p>Direct USG counternarcotics assistance to Burma has been </p><p>suspended since 1988, when the Burmese military suppressed </p><p>the pro-democracy movement.  The USG now engages the Burmese </p><p>government in regard to narcotics control only on a very </p><p>limited level.  DEA, through the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon, </p><p>shares drug-related intelligence with the GOB and conducts </p><p>joint drug-enforcement investigations with Burmese </p><p>counternarcotics authorities.  Other U.S. agencies have </p><p>conducted opium yield surveys in the mountainous regions of </p><p>the Shan State in 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, </p><p>and 2002 with essential assistance provided by Burmese </p><p>counterparts.  These surveys give both governments an </p><p>accurate understanding of the scope, magnitude, and changing </p><p>geographic distribution of Burma\'s opium crop. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government regularly urges the Burmese government to </p><p>continue to take steps to curb narcotics production and </p><p>trafficking.  Specifically, we have encouraged the Burmese </p><p>government to: </p><p> </p><p>--    Comply with the provisions of UN Drug Conventions by </p><p>taking demonstrable and verifiable actions against high level </p><p>drug traffickers and their organizations; </p><p> </p><p>--    Increase opium eradication and significantly increase </p><p>seizure rates for opium, heroin, and methamphetamines; </p><p>control the diversion of precursor chemicals; and destroy </p><p>significantly more heroin and methamphetamine laboratories; </p><p>--    Continue cooperation with China and Thailand and expand </p><p>cooperation to other neighboring countries such as India; </p><p> </p><p>--    Enforce existing money laundering laws, including asset </p><p>forfeiture provisions, and fully implement and enforce </p><p>Burma\'s new money laundering legislation; </p><p> </p><p>--    Prosecute drug-related corruption, especially corrupt </p><p>government and military officials who facilitate drug </p><p>trafficking and money laundering; and </p><p> </p><p>--    Expand demand reduction, prevention and drug treatment </p><p>programs to reduce drug use and control the spread of </p><p>HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>B. Bilateral Cooperation </p><p> </p><p>USG counternarcotics cooperation with the Burmese regime is </p><p>restricted to basic law-enforcement operations.  The U.S. </p><p>provides no bilateral material or training assistance.  DEA\'s </p><p>liaison with Burmese policy makers and military officials -- </p><p>conducted mainly through DEA\'s office in Rangoon -- focuses </p><p>on providing intelligence on enforcement targets and </p><p>coordinating investigations of international drug-trafficking </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p>C. The Road Ahead </p><p> </p><p>The Burmese government has committed itself in recent years </p><p>to effective counternarcotics measures, has found major </p><p>regional allies (particularly China) in this fight, and has </p><p>built up the capacity to identify and punish drug traffickers </p><p>and major trafficking organizations, even within the context </p><p>of very limited resources.  Based on experience in dealing </p><p>with significant narcotics-trafficking problems elsewhere in </p><p>the world, the USG recognizes that large-scale and long-term </p><p>international aid -- including development assistance and </p><p>law-enforcement aid -- would help curb drug production and </p><p>trafficking in Burma.  However, recurring human rights </p><p>problems have limited international support of all kinds, </p><p>including support for Burma\'s law enforcement efforts.  The </p><p>USG believes that the Government of Burma should continue to </p><p>combat corruption, enforce its narcotics and money-laundering </p><p>legislation, and deal with drug abuse.  Its efforts have </p><p>produced measurable results.  Continued, they could lead to a </p><p>sustained reduction in all forms of narcotics production and </p><p>trafficking from an area that has been one of the world\'s </p><p>major drug trafficking centers. </p><p> </p><p>STATISTICAL TABLES                        2002        2001 </p><p>2000 </p><p> </p><p>OPIUM - MAXIMUM HARVESTABLE         77,700      105,150 </p><p>108,700 </p><p>CULTIVATION (HECTARES) </p><p> </p><p>ERADICATION (ACRES)                 25,862      26,113 </p><p>N/A </p><p> </p><p>POTENTIAL OPIUM GUM                       630         865 </p><p>1,085 </p><p>(METRIC TONS) </p><p> </p><p>SEIZURES </p><p>OPIUM (METRIC TONS)                       1.631*      1.629 </p><p>1.528 </p><p>HEROIN (METRIC TONS)                .285* .097        .171 </p><p> </p><p>STIMULANT DRUGS                     8.8*        32.0 </p><p>26.7 </p><p>(MILLION TABLETS) </p><p>CANNABIS    (Metric Tons)           N/A         .284  .602 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HEROIN LABS DESTROYED               7**         14 </p><p>23 </p><p>METH LABS DESTROYED                 6**         N/A         6 </p><p> </p><p>ARRESTS                                   4,148***    N/A </p><p>4,881 </p><p>HEROIN USERS (Thousands)            N/A         N/A </p><p>N/A </p><p>OPIUM USERS (Thousands)             N/A         N/A </p><p>N/A </p><p> </p><p>* - during first 10 months of 2002 </p><p>** - during first 9 months of 2002 </p><p>*** - during first 8 months of 2002 </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
