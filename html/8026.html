Ashley Wills: </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  SA A/S Rocca used her May 12 meetings </p><p>with President Kumaratunga, Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe, and other GSL officials to underline </p><p>strong U.S. support for the peace process.  Noting the </p><p>recent spike in cohabitation tensions, A/S Rocca also </p><p>urged that parties work together in the national </p><p>interest.  Both the president and the prime minister </p><p>stressed their support for the peace track, with the </p><p>president very critical of the Tigers.  Re cohabitation, </p><p>both indicated that they did not want to see an </p><p>escalation in tensions.  A/S Rocca\'s visit was very </p><p>successful in highlighting strong U.S. support for Sri </p><p>Lanka during this sensitive timeframe.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>A/S Rocca\'s May 12 Meetings </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs </p><p>Christina Rocca met May 12 with President Chandrika </p><p>Kumaratunga, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and </p><p>Foreign Minister Tyronne Fernando.  A/S Rocca also had </p><p>tea with key ministers G.L. Peiris and Milinda Moragoda, </p><p>and lunch with a selection of top Tamil politicians and </p><p>think-tank analysts. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>President makes Moderate Sounds </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  At her meeting with A/S Rocca, President </p><p>Kumaratunga was joined by former foreign minister </p><p>Lakshman Kadirgamar and presidential spokesman Harim </p><p>Peiris.   A/S Rocca began the meeting by underscoring </p><p>strong U.S. support for the peace process, and our hope </p><p>that major parties will pull together to see it through. </p><p>Sri Lanka should be proud that it is a model of conflict </p><p>resolution for South Asia and other regions, she </p><p>emphasized. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) President Kumaratunga responded that Sri Lankans </p><p>truly value the assistance of their friends in the </p><p>international community.  Re the peace process, she </p><p>stressed that she strongly supports the government\'s </p><p>efforts.  That said, she expressed concern that the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have not really </p><p>given up anything substantive in the peace talks, but </p><p>the group has demanded much from the GSL.  The </p><p>international community must press the LTTE on human </p><p>rights issues because the government had already </p><p>surrendered much of its bargaining power and was not </p><p>pressuring the Tigers enough.  Kumaratunga went on to </p><p>assert that the lack of professional, experienced peace </p><p>monitors had been a source of much controversy.  (Note: </p><p>This was a reference to the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission, "SLMM," which is charged with </p><p>monitoring adherence to the February 2002 ceasefire </p><p>agreement.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ambassador Wills took the opportunity to brief </p><p>the president on a recent document drafted by the donor </p><p>community which contained milestones re development </p><p>assistance, including re the observance of human rights </p><p>(see Reftels).  The current plan, he noted, was to </p><p>present the document privately to both sides if and when </p><p>talks resume.  Kumaratunga warned that the current </p><p>actions of the LTTE (e.g., blaming the GSL for delays in </p><p>the talks, highlighting minor issues as major problems) </p><p>are similar to those taken by the group in the past just </p><p>before breaking off talks.  Kumaratunga added that </p><p>Deputy Secretary Armitage and the Ambassador had made </p><p>very refreshing and helpful statements, which had served </p><p>to reinforce the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Turning to the tense cohabitation situation, </p><p>Kumaratunga asserted that the current rift over the </p><p>Development Lotteries Board was much ado about nothing. </p><p>(Note:  Per Reftel review of recent events, the </p><p>president tried to take over the lotteries board late </p><p>last week, but the government blocked the move.  Both </p><p>sides are now reviewing next steps in this controversial </p><p>matter.)  She asserted that she had performed a minor </p><p>administrative act to which the government had reacted </p><p>violently and illegally.  Her intent was not to create a </p><p>crisis, she said, only to ensure that lottery proceeds </p><p>were allotted in correct fashion.  The Ambassador </p><p>emphasized that the U.S., first and foremost, saw this </p><p>issue as an internal matter.  The way it was playing </p><p>out, however, raised concerns that the two major parties </p><p>were bickering to the net detriment of the peace </p><p>process.  Kumaratunga asserted that the government had </p><p>made it impossible for cordial cohabitation relations. </p><p>Members of the GSL, for example, did not routinely </p><p>consult or inform her of what was going on, she said. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>PM reviews Peace Process, Cohabitation </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In her meeting with Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe, A/S Rocca expressed her pleasure at </p><p>returning to Sri Lanka (she had also visited in March </p><p>2002), and assured him of strong and continued U.S. </p><p>support for the peace process.  Re the peace track, the </p><p>PM commented that both the GSL and the LTTE had to look </p><p>long-term.  It would be helpful if they could jointly </p><p>develop a road map with timeframes focused on keeping </p><p>the international community engaged.  A/S Rocca asked </p><p>the PM about the LTTE\'s current mindset.  The PM replied </p><p>that he viewed the LTTE\'s recent pullout from the peace </p><p>talks as being the result of the influence of Tiger </p><p>hard-liners, who wanted the LTTE to re-establish control </p><p>over the pace and agenda of the process.  Wickremesinghe </p><p>predicted that the LTTE\'s desire for funding and </p><p>reconstruction assistance for the north and east would </p><p>lead the group to change its mind and decide to attend </p><p>the June donors conference in Tokyo.  Minister Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, also present at the meeting, added that the </p><p>Tigers\' lack of democratic experience was at the root of </p><p>the peace process\' current difficulties.  Both </p><p>Wickremasinghe and Moragoda expressed appreciation for </p><p>consistent U.S. support for the peace track. </p><p>Wickremesinghe reacted positively to a suggestion by </p><p>Ambassador Wills for a possible "clear-the-air," low-key </p><p>meeting between the GSL and the Tigers prior to Tokyo </p><p>(if the LTTE decides to attend the conference). </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Expressing her concern about the recent spike in </p><p>cohabitation stresses, A/S Rocca asked PM Wickremesinghe </p><p>for his view of the evolving situation.  The PM saw only </p><p>two possible resolutions to the dispute over who </p><p>controls the lotteries board:  (1) talks with President </p><p>Kumaratunga that would provide her some sort of face- </p><p>saving cover to rescind her order taking over the board; </p><p>or (2) escalating cohabitation tensions that would help </p><p>no one.  The prime minister added that he personally </p><p>remained optimistic about a resolution to the dispute </p><p>over the lotteries board, though he could not discount </p><p>the likelihood of further cohabitation tensions. </p><p>Wickremesinghe said his greatest fear was having the </p><p>LTTE view this situation as a weakening of the </p><p>government\'s resolve and power, hindering its efforts to </p><p>achieve a negotiated settlement. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In regard to international matters, A/S Rocca </p><p>and PM Wickremasinghe exchanged views about the GSL\'s </p><p>recent proposal to form some sort of group that would </p><p>counter the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).  The PM said the </p><p>government wanted to form a group of moderate, </p><p>developing countries that would work within the UN </p><p>system on key international issues.  A/S Rocca said the </p><p>U.S. was very interested in the proposal and had </p><p>compiled a preliminary list of possible countries that </p><p>might join, including several from each geographical </p><p>region.  A/S Rocca asked what the GSL\'s next steps would </p><p>be regarding the proposal, and how it anticipated its </p><p>role vis-a-vis other voting blocs in the UN. </p><p>Wickremesinghe, who referred to the possible grouping as </p><p>"the axis of hope," stated that the GSL was still </p><p>reviewing how to handle it.  The plan as of this point </p><p>was to float the idea publicly after the June donors </p><p>conference in Tokyo and perhaps formally announce it </p><p>during the UNGA in September.  (Note:  That evening at </p><p>dinner Minister Morogoda asked for names of individuals </p><p>from the countries we think might be interested in this </p><p>proposal, saying that once he has the list he will </p><p>contact them personally.)  (Note:  Wickremesinghe also </p><p>commented that the GSL would like to have meetings with </p><p>President Bush and high-level U.S. officials on the </p><p>margins of UNGA.)  At the close of the meeting, A/S </p><p>Rocca expressed deep appreciation to the Sri Lankan </p><p>government for its November 2002 signing of an </p><p>Article 98 waiver of International Criminal Court (ICC) </p><p>jurisdiction with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Tea with Key Ministers </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) In her meeting with G.L. Peiris and Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, A/S Rocca asked about the status of the peace </p><p>process.  Both ministers seemed somewhat optimistic that </p><p>the LTTE would, in the end, return to the peace talks </p><p>and decide to attend the June donors conference.  Peiris </p><p>stressed that the government was working hard to give </p><p>the LTTE the assurances the group needed for it to </p><p>return to the talks, especially in regard to the </p><p>provision of funds for humanitarian assistance in the </p><p>north and east.  Morogoda underscored the importance of </p><p>continuing to work with the LTTE.  He admitted that it </p><p>was not easy, but he thought the LTTE could be convinced </p><p>to go in the right direction via constant consultation </p><p>and explanation. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) On the subject of the latest cohabitation </p><p>tensions, Minister Peiris claimed that the GSL had a </p><p>strong legal case in that the president had not </p><p>consulted with the PM regarding the attempt to take over </p><p>the lotteries board.  The Sri Lankan Constitution </p><p>required such consultation, he stressed.  Moreover, in </p><p>taking such a rash action, she was losing the political </p><p>fight, he claimed.  All in all, Peiris said he thought </p><p>the current situation could be worked out without more </p><p>escalation.  He allowed, however, that cohabitation ties </p><p>would remain tense and subject to periodic crises, which </p><p>he said stemmed from the president\'s irascibility and </p><p>sense of entitlement.  The government had information, </p><p>for example, that the president might be using the </p><p>lotteries board matter as a "test" before trying to </p><p>replace the interior minister, but it was not clear, he </p><p>noted. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Brief Meeting with the FM </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>12.  (C) In her brief meeting with Foreign Minister </p><p>Fernando, A/S Rocca provided a readout on her recent </p><p>visit to India and Pakistan.  FM Fernando commented that </p><p>peace in the South Asia was critical to Sri Lanka, and </p><p>it would be positive for the region if the Indians and </p><p>Pakistanis continued to work to lower tensions.  Foreign </p><p>Secretary Nihal Rodrigo, who was also in the meeting, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>noted India\'s nervousness due to Pakistan\'s chairing of </p><p>the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation </p><p>(SAARC).  A/S Rocca replied that the U.S. was watching </p><p>the situation closely and continued to hope that SAARC </p><p>could help bridge differences.  A/S Rocca remarked that </p><p>Sri Lanka was an excellent model for the rest of the </p><p>international community, including South Asia, and she </p><p>urged the government to persevere in the peace track. </p><p>Fernando replied that the government was committed to </p><p>the peace process, and hoped that the LTTE would soon </p><p>return to the talks and come to the June donors </p><p>conference.  Regarding the latest re cohabitation, </p><p>Fernando remarked that he thought the situation could be </p><p>worked out without a major escalation in tensions.  He </p><p>averred that the U.S. and others in the international </p><p>community could play a role in smoothing the waters. </p><p>(Note:  The FM was also the host of a May 12 dinner in </p><p>honor of A/S Rocca.  Muslim leader Raul Hakeem, chief of </p><p>the Peace Secretariat Bernard Goonetilleke, and other </p><p>key GSL ministers and officials attended the dinner.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Lunch with Tamil MPs, NGO Representatives </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) The May 12 lunch with several Tamil National </p><p>Alliance (TNA) MPs and representatives of local think- </p><p>tanks and NGOs was a lively affair.  Senior TNA MP R. </p><p>Sampathan asserted that the LTTE was raising legitimate </p><p>complaints re the delivery of humanitarian assistance </p><p>and the size of the security zones in the Jaffna </p><p>District.  Until the LTTE had satisfaction re these </p><p>matters, they would not return to negotiations, </p><p>according to Sampathan.  When queried, TNA MP G. </p><p>Ponnambalam replied that if the Tigers did not attend </p><p>the planned June donors conference, then the conference </p><p>should be postponed until the LTTE\'s participation could </p><p>be assured.  Vigorously countering the pro-LTTE trend of </p><p>these comments, Kethesh Loganathan, a local think-tank </p><p>analyst who is Tamil, said there were many views in the </p><p>Tamil community and the LTTE had no right to claim to </p><p>speak for all Tamils.  National Unity Alliance (NUA) MP </p><p>Ferial Ashraff, a Muslim, complained about LTTE actions </p><p>in the east, noting that the group continued to harass </p><p>and extort money from Muslims.  Ambassador Wills noted </p><p>the copious evidence that the Tigers were assassinating </p><p>opponents in the Tamil community.  In response to these </p><p>points, Sampathan replied that the LTTE had a lot of </p><p>growing up to do before it would become a genuine </p><p>political organization, but the group was slowly moving </p><p>in the right direction. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) A/S Rocca\'s visit was very successful in </p><p>highlighting to interlocutors strong U.S. support for </p><p>Sri Lanka and its people during this sensitive </p><p>timeframe.  Both the president and the prime minister, </p><p>for example, tried to appear reasonable in discussing </p><p>the cohabitation situation with A/S Rocca.  This tone of </p><p>moderation seems to have worn off a bit on both sides in </p><p>that the cohabitation situation does not appear as acute </p><p>now as it did previously (though it could still </p><p>escalate).  Moreover, during a difficult timeframe for </p><p>the peace process, the Assistant Secretary was able to </p><p>underscore to the GSL our support for its policies while </p><p>noting our concerns about LTTE behavior.  Overall, as </p><p>exemplified by A/S Rocca\'s latest visit, Sri Lankans </p><p>clearly appreciate continued high-level U.S. interest, </p><p>seeing such engagement as vital in helping return the </p><p>country to long-term peace and security.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
