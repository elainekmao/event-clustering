EU\'s Belgian Foreign Minister Louis </p><p>Michel stressed that if Turkey launched a military action in </p><p>the region, it would not be admitted to the EU.  Germany </p><p>threatened to withdraw its AWACS and Patriot systems from </p><p>Turkey in the event of a cross-border operation into Iraq. </p><p>Papers echo strong criticism by the Iraqi Vice President, </p><p>Yasin Ramadan, who slammed the `Islamist AKP government,\' </p><p>saying that the `Turkish people are not traitors, but the </p><p>party in power is a product of the U.S.\'  Mainstream papers </p><p>criticize the `failure\' of AKP policies which drew fire from </p><p>all sides.  Papers are concerned that the Northern Iraq </p><p>issue has become a source of tension between Turkey and the </p><p>U.S.  Addressing the nation on Sunday, Prime Minister </p><p>Erdogan said that Turkey would set up a buffer zone inside </p><p>Northern Iraq to halt possible terrorist infiltration and to </p><p>control refugee flow.  U.S. hopes for a quick victory in </p><p>Iraq have been shattered after growing losses suffered by </p><p>U.S. and UK troops and the broadcast of video footage of </p><p>captured U.S. soldiers.  Reports comment that the U.S. was </p><p>shocked by the fierce Iraqi resistance, and that seizing </p><p>Baghdad would be tougher than previously thought.  Weekend </p><p>papers say that Turkey\'s opening its air corridor to U.S. </p><p>was an effort to ease tension with the U.S.  Sunday\'s papers </p><p>report TGS Chief General Ozkok\'s denial of Saturday\'s press </p><p>stories concerning an alleged Turkish troop incursion into </p><p>Northern Iraq.  Papers claim that the U.S. has laid down </p><p>three conditions for a Turkish military presence in the </p><p>region: Turkey should wait before dispatching troops; heavy </p><p>weaponry should not be deployed; troops should not advance </p><p>further than 15 km inside Northern Iraq.  Saturday\'s papers </p><p>say that the U.S. has urged Ankara to expel Iraqi diplomats </p><p>for alleged involvement in espionage activities.  The MFA </p><p>has asked the U.S. for further evidence, reports note.  U.S. </p><p>troops are leaving their logistical and operations centers </p><p>in southeast Turkey, taking back military equipment through </p><p>the port of Iskenderun, all papers report on Monday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  War in Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The 5th Day" </p><p>Social democrat-intellectual Cumhuriyet carried this front </p><p>page editorial comment (3/24): "Whether the war in Iraq </p><p>takes longer than expected as President Bush has suggested, </p><p>or shorter, the result will be the same: nothing will be </p><p>easy in the future.  The people of Iraq have not welcomed </p><p>the foreign troops as saviors, contrary to what Bush and his </p><p>aides had hoped and expected.  In this context, Turkey\'s </p><p>position stands on basic principle and is the right one. </p><p>Turkey cannot be part of an unjust war, and cannot subvert </p><p>international law and legitimacy for the sake of our </p><p>strategic ally. . The bilateral atmosphere between Ankara </p><p>and Washington is cool at the moment.  Yet the fact of the </p><p>matter is that the Bush administration is in need of </p><p>Turkey\'s cooperation if it aims to establish US sovereignty </p><p>over the oil region in the Muslim world." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A mistake which can last for the next two generations" </p><p>Fatih Altayli criticized Turkey\'s handling of the Iraq issue </p><p>in mass appeal Hurriyet (3/24): "From the very beginning, </p><p>the AKP government constantly gave the wrong signals. </p><p>Moreover, advisers or bureaucrats `close to the AKP\' misled </p><p>Washington even more.  In the end, Turkey took the necessary </p><p>steps, but it was too late for them to do any good.  There </p><p>are clear messages coming from the US now.  Even well-known </p><p>pro-Turkish Congressmen are keeping their distance from </p><p>Turkey.  Handling some critical issues in the near future, </p><p>such as the Armenian genocide resolution, might not be as </p><p>easy as it used to be.  Turkey is hurting itself by not </p><p>giving a clear `yes\' or `no\' answer to the US.  There is a </p><p>big price to pay -- not only for us, but for the next </p><p>generation as well." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The current situation" </p><p>Hasan Unal commented in the Islamic-intellectual Zaman </p><p>(3/24): "It would be different had Turkey stood against the </p><p>war clearly from the very beginning.  This, of course, would </p><p>have required no negotiation and no bargaining with the US. </p><p>. Now we look like an undesired, abandoned baby who nobody </p><p>wants to care for.  Turkey seriously damaged its very </p><p>important relationship with the US.  At the same time, </p><p>Turkey failed to prevent the war from happening.  Moreover, </p><p>Turkey\'s rights and interests -- not only in Iraq, but in </p><p>the entire region  -- are now at stake.  Such incredible </p><p>strategic planning and diplomatic achievement (!) deserves </p><p>to be a future case study in universities." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
