(C) During its January 27 to 29 visit to Ankara, the U.S. </p><p>Humanitarian </p><p>Planning Team (HPT) discussed contingency planning for a </p><p>possible humanitarian </p><p>crisis arising from the situation in Iraq with the GOT, </p><p>representatives of the </p><p>KDP and PUK administrations in northern Iraq, a </p><p>representative of the Iraqi </p><p>Turkmen Front, and international organizations.  While the </p><p>GOT was receptive to </p><p>our offer to consult and to assist, it is hesitant to </p><p>establish crisis </p><p>coordination centers to begin to implement its planning. </p><p>MFA is also wary of </p><p>providing NGOs access to Iraq through Turkey, though it is </p><p>establishing a mechanism to register and define the </p><p>activities of relief NGOs. </p><p>MFA insisted that NGOs  will have to coordinate their </p><p>activities with the Turkish Red Crescent and the </p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  KDP and PUK </p><p>representatives described their contingency planning, </p><p>claiming that their </p><p>administrations have the capacity to run the Oil for Food </p><p>(OFF) ration distribution system and other humanitarian </p><p>assistance programs when the UN evacuates, if adequate </p><p>funding and other resources are provided.  The Turkish Red </p><p>Crescent </p><p>told us that it had the mandate to coordinate all relief </p><p>efforts in the </p><p>northern Iraq buffer zone, a position disputed by the local </p><p>representative of </p><p>the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red </p><p>Crescent Societies.  UN </p><p>agencies described contingency planning and limited </p><p>pre-positioning of relief </p><p>supplies by UNHCR, UNICEF and WFP, and said they were </p><p>negotiating a legal </p><p>framework with the GOT to allow UN agencies to provide relief </p><p>to Iraq via </p><p>Turkey.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Humanitarian Planning Team (HPT) delegation </p><p>included:  Richard </p><p>Greene, PDAS, State/PRM; William Garvelink, Deputy Assistant </p><p>Administrator, </p><p>USAID; Andrew Wyllie, PRM/ANE; Roger Corneretto, JCS; David </p><p>Tarantino, DOD/OSD; </p><p>Major Ray Eiriz, CENTCOM; Ron Libby, USAID/OFDA; Greg </p><p>Austreng, USAID/OFDA; and </p><p>Todd Horne, USAID/OFDA.  Representatives of EUCOM, the Office </p><p>of Defense </p><p>Cooperation (ODC) and Emboffs also attended the meetings. </p><p>HPT held separate </p><p>meetings with a GOT interagency group led by MFA; and </p><p>representatives of:  the </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent; the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK); </p><p>the Kurdistan </p><p>Democratic Party (KDP); the International Federation of Red </p><p>Cross and Red </p><p>Crescent Societies (IFRC); the American Red Cross; Iraqi </p><p>Turkmen Front (ITF); </p><p>the Turkmeneli Foundation; and a joint meeting with most </p><p>elements of the UN,s </p><p>country team in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HPT,s Message </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Greene and other members of the HPT provided </p><p>interlocutors with an </p><p>overview of U.S. contingency planning and key humanitarian </p><p>objectives.  While </p><p>emphasizing that the Administration has not made a decision </p><p>to use force in </p><p>Iraq, HPT emphasized the importance of: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Incorporating humanitarian assistance (HA) concerns into </p><p>military planning, </p><p>particularly with respect to limiting damage to HA </p><p>infrastructure and creating </p><p>safe areas in which relief organizations can work.  Rapid </p><p>restoration of the </p><p>Oil for Food (OFF) ration distribution system and pipeline </p><p>following any military operations is particularly </p><p>important.  These measures are intended to help persuade </p><p>vulnerable populations not to </p><p>leave their homes, minimizing the scope of the relief effort; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Building an HA coalition between and within the USG, UN </p><p>agencies, other </p><p>international HA organizations, NGOs, other donor </p><p>governments, and governments </p><p>in the region.  Coordination mechanisms such as the </p><p>Humanitarian Operations Center currently being established in </p><p>Kuwait and the UN,s Joint Logistics Center (JLC) are key; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Pre-positioning assets and personnel to respond to a </p><p>crisis, including AID </p><p>Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Identifying relief funding requirements and sources; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Obtaining safe and timely access for HA organizations to </p><p>crisis locations; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Limiting adverse impact for Iraq,s neighbors; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Learning the lessons of the 1991 humanitarian crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Variables affecting the ability to respond to a crisis </p><p>include:  the </p><p>intensity and duration of possible military operations; </p><p>damage to HA </p><p>infrastructure; international support for relief; access to </p><p>vulnerable </p><p>populations; and the unpredictable response of the Iraqi </p><p>regime, including the </p><p>possibility that chemical and biological weapons, or the </p><p>threat thereof, might be used to create fear and panic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Discussion of Contingency Planning with the GOT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On January 28, the HPT met with an interagency </p><p>group, including </p><p>representatives of MFA, the Turkish General Staff (TGS), the </p><p>Prime Ministry,s </p><p>Emergency Management General Directorate, and the Turkish Red </p><p>Crescent (TRC). </p><p>Tunc Ugdul, MFA Deputy Director General for International </p><p>Political </p><p>Organizations, led the Turkish delegation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ugdul began by reading from a prepared statement </p><p>outlining Turkey,s HA </p><p>preparations and concerns.  He noted the GOT,s concerns </p><p>about the economic </p><p>impact of a war in Iraq on the Turkish economy, and contended </p><p>that Turkey faced </p><p>the 1991 refugee/internally displaced person (IDP) crisis on </p><p>its own.  Turkey </p><p>has done contingency planning both on an internal, </p><p>interagency basis and with </p><p>international organizations.  The GOT plans to establish 18 </p><p>&humanitarian aid </p><p>collection zones8 in northern Iraq and Turkey which could </p><p>handle up to 276,000 </p><p>refugees/IDPs.  Turkey plans to repatriate displaced persons </p><p>as soon as the </p><p>security situation would permit this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) TRC has pre-positioned some resources, but there are </p><p>gaps in TRC,s </p><p>ability to respond in the event the full 276,000 persons need </p><p>relief, in part </p><p>because TRC is not supposed to dedicate more than 60 percent </p><p>of its capacity to </p><p>any single crisis.  Ugdul noted that TRC has 30,000 tents </p><p>which can shelter </p><p>only about 160,000 people.  MFA is meeting regularly with </p><p>UNHCR, which has </p><p>begun to shift relief supplies (tents, blankets, bedding, </p><p>kitchen equipment) </p><p>into Turkey.  The GOT has designated airports to bring in </p><p>relief supplies. </p><p>Ugdul also noted that 60 percent of the Iraqi population is </p><p>entirely dependant on the </p><p>OFF ration to meet their monthly household needs and </p><p>emphasized GOT,s concern about disruption to that </p><p>distribution system.  Greene responded that major </p><p>international organizations desperately need additional </p><p>funding in order to respond to a potential crisis in the </p><p>region, and that the USG planned to not only contribute, but </p><p>also to mobilize other </p><p>donors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Humanitarian Access:  HPT emphasized the importance of </p><p>allowing humanitarian access </p><p>across Turkey,s frontier to deliver relief, and emphasized </p><p>the important role that NGOs could play in the delivery of </p><p>humanitarian assistance, particularly since the UN agencies </p><p>rely heavily on NGOs in the implementation of their own </p><p>assistance programs.  Providing safe and early access for </p><p>humanitarian agencies is a key element in our ability to </p><p>persuade Iraqis not to leave their homes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Ugdul responded that GOT was still considering how to </p><p>deal with NGO </p><p>requests for access, but that it planned to establish a </p><p>registration process </p><p>for NGOs and to craft memoranda of understanding defining the </p><p>activities of </p><p>those which could enter Iraq from Turkey.  Ugdul and Head of </p><p>Department Feza </p><p>Ozturk underlined the need for NGOs to coordinate their </p><p>activities with TRC and </p><p>UN agencies, while acknowledging that the International </p><p>Committee of the Red </p><p>Cross (ICRC) would have the mandate for HA in areas of </p><p>military conflict.  MOUs </p><p>would be signed only if there is a need for NGO assistance in </p><p>the Turkish-run </p><p>camps.  Ugdul and Ozturk insisted that multiple NGOs would </p><p>not be permitted </p><p>entry if their efforts duplicated existing relief.  Ozturk </p><p>said that, according </p><p>to the Geneva conventions, the commander of a military </p><p>occupation force has the </p><p>right and responsibility to determine which NGOs are </p><p>permitted in the area.  He </p><p>added that the UN,s World Food Program (WFP) would face no </p><p>access barriers from </p><p>the Turkish authorities, but pointed out that UN agencies in </p><p>Turkey have no </p><p>mandate to operate outside Turkish borders and that this </p><p>problem would have to </p><p>be resolved.  NGO applications for work in Iraq beyond </p><p>Turkish-run camps would </p><p>be considered on an ad hoc basis.  Four (unnamed) NGOs, </p><p>including two from </p><p>Turkey, had applied for access, but none have yet been </p><p>granted it.  HPT </p><p>requested a speedy review of NGO applications and </p><p>consideration for those </p><p>intending to supply areas beyond Turkish-run camps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Deconflicting Military/Civilian Operations:  In </p><p>response to the GOT,s </p><p>remarks on military and civilian designations for transport </p><p>hubs and routes, </p><p>HPT pointed out that military locations could be shared with </p><p>civilian </p><p>authorities to move HA provided the military retained overall </p><p>control of those </p><p>locations.  For example, an airport designated for military </p><p>use could accept humanitarian supplies, provided the military </p><p>retained overall control of the facility and its operations. </p><p>HPT proposed that these details be discussed in </p><p>technical-level meetings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) HPT raised the importance of coordination between </p><p>civilian and military </p><p>planners in both our governments, as well as between them and </p><p>international </p><p>organizations and NGOs, pointing to the positive example of </p><p>the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) being established in </p><p>Kuwait.  HPT proposed establishing a similar mechanism in </p><p>Turkey to deconflict civilian and military operations and </p><p>share information bilaterally and with other humanitarian </p><p>relief providers.  Ideally, any mechanism in Turkey would be </p><p>plugged into the HOC in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) MFA responded that the GOT had plans to establish </p><p>crisis/coordination </p><p>centers in the Prime Ministry, MFA, Diyarbakir, Gaziantep and </p><p>Van in the event </p><p>of a conflict in Iraq.  MFA has also identified 42 diplomats </p><p>to staff these </p><p>centers.  However, the GOT is reluctant to establish them </p><p>now, claiming that </p><p>this could alarm the public by implying that war is </p><p>inevitable.  Ozturk </p><p>suggested that the primary communications link on HA issues </p><p>be established </p><p>between the U.S. Embassy and MFA, and offered himself as the </p><p>point of contact. </p><p>HPT agreed, and Embassy,s Mission Disaster Relief Officer </p><p>(MDRO)  was </p><p>designated as the U.S. POC.  HPT noted that MDRO would be </p><p>assisted by AID,s </p><p>DART team, by EUCOM and possibly other USG elements in the </p><p>near future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) HDRs:  HPT members stated that local procurement </p><p>would be an important </p><p>element in the U.S. delivery of relief supplies, but that </p><p>there were items ) </p><p>including one million humanitarian daily rations (HDRs) ) </p><p>that we would like to </p><p>import for pre-positioning in Turkey.  A request to </p><p>pre-position HDRs had not </p><p>been approved pending a request from the Turkish General </p><p>Staff for further </p><p>information on the request (reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) CBW:  Fatih Evren, TRC,s General Director, asked how </p><p>the USG planned to </p><p>respond if Saddam Hussein were to use CBW to create a </p><p>humanitarian crisis.  HPT,s military members responded that </p><p>the U.S. military has planned extensively for this </p><p>possibility by taking steps in any conflict to limit the </p><p>GOI,s ability to use weapons of mass destruction and by </p><p>containing the extent of damage if these weapons are in fact </p><p>used.  HPT recognizes that civilian organizations do not </p><p>have the equipment and expertise to protect themselves from </p><p>CBW attack and that widespread use of CBW would have serious </p><p>implications for the humanitarian relief plan.  The U.S. </p><p>military, within the limits of its resources and </p><p>capabilities, aims to take appropriate action to enable </p><p>civilian organizations to safely assume </p><p>relief efforts as quickly as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The Turks asked if the USG had any plans for </p><p>&internment of the </p><p>civilian population8 and said one assumption of Turkish </p><p>planning is a mass </p><p>movement of IDPs toward the Turkish frontier.  Greene </p><p>responded that the USG </p><p>would not forcibly stop civilian movement.  Rather, our </p><p>strategy is to </p><p>enable Iraqis to avoid having to flee their homes due to a </p><p>lack of assistance by ensuring speedy access for relief </p><p>providers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Joint Meeting with PUK and KDP Representatives </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The HPT delegation discussed the humanitarian </p><p>situation with Bahros </p><p>Galali and Shusti Mehedin, of the Patriotic Union of </p><p>Kurdistan (PUK), and </p><p>Safeen Dizayee, Hoshyar Siweyti, Karim Sinjari, Cemal Hamit, </p><p>Chusty Asad, of </p><p>the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) on January 28.  KDP and </p><p>PUK </p><p>representatives outlined major differences between the </p><p>current situation and </p><p>that of 1991:  almost all of the 5,000 villages destroyed by </p><p>the regime in </p><p>1987-89 have been rebuilt  and reconstruction in the north </p><p>has gone well beyond </p><p>those villages; the local administration is not answerable to </p><p>Baghdad and the </p><p>population trusts it; there are UN and NGO structures, along </p><p>with the OFF; the </p><p>local population does not want to repeat the experience of </p><p>1991. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) KDP representatives told HPT that they had </p><p>established a structure to </p><p>deal with a possible humanitarian crisis, including an </p><p>emergency committee </p><p>reporting to the KDP &Interior Minister8 Karim Sinjari and </p><p>committees in major </p><p>cities, subdistricts and villages to coordinate activities </p><p>with NGOs.  KDP and </p><p>PUK have also begun to identify 17 camp sites for IDPs (10 in </p><p>the KDP region, 7 </p><p>in the PUK region).  KDP representatives said they do not </p><p>expect many Kurdish </p><p>IDPs, but others in central and southern Iraq could move to </p><p>the north.  They </p><p>registered strong concern that the UN agencies and the ICRC </p><p>in Iraq were not </p><p>prepared to respond to a crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Echoing many of the KDP,s points, PUK </p><p>representatives told us that its & </p><p>Prime Minister8 chaired an emergency committee on </p><p>humanitarian assistance.  PUK </p><p>predicts that 500,000 Iraqis from the center and south will </p><p>come to the north </p><p>and is planning on seven camps, each capable of handling </p><p>100,000 DPs, to deal </p><p>with that contingency.  They also cited the need for funds to </p><p>stock emergency </p><p>supplies.  Noting the UN,s plans to evacuate expatriate </p><p>staff in the event of </p><p>war, PUK expressed the belief that this would bring the 986 </p><p>program to a halt </p><p>given that national staff of the UN agencies do not have the </p><p>authority to run </p><p>the program.  International NGOs in northern Iraq, on the </p><p>other hand, intend to </p><p>remain.  PUK told us that, while they expected most IDPs to </p><p>be cared for within </p><p>Iraqi, they hoped neighboring states would not close their </p><p>borders to displaced </p><p>Iraqis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) KDP representatives expressed concern with deficits </p><p>in rations </p><p>authorized by Baghdad, stating that they had not received </p><p>their January flour </p><p>ration, the fuel ration had been cut by more than half, and </p><p>that they had </p><p>received only 30 percent of their medicine allocation.  They </p><p>also cited serious </p><p>shortfalls of medical supplies and equipment (especially </p><p>ambulances, vaccines), </p><p>fuel, food and shelter to cope with an influx from outside </p><p>the KDP area.  KDP </p><p>asserted that the authorities have limited amounts of food in </p><p>warehouses for the local population, but no surplus for IDPs </p><p>from elsewhere in Iraq and that food rations for as </p><p>many as one million persons might be needed.  They stated </p><p>that there was </p><p>milling capacity in Erbil and Sulimaniye, but that this was </p><p>contingent on </p><p>adequate fuel supplies to power electricity generators. </p><p>About 17,000 to 18,000 </p><p>tons of wheat are need to feed one million people.  They said </p><p>that UN agencies </p><p>had not responded to their requests to provide supplies and </p><p>asked the USG to </p><p>fill these gaps.  Both KDP and PUK stated that they were </p><p>concerned about their </p><p>inability to cope with the humanitarian and medical needs </p><p>that could be </p><p>generated by use of CBW and asked for U.S. assistance in this </p><p>area.  They said </p><p>that they had no gas masks or capability to detect/diagnose </p><p>CBW effects.  Both </p><p>groups stated that if their funding and supply shortfalls </p><p>were met, local </p><p>administrations had the ability to manage relief operations </p><p>in consultation </p><p>with the UN and NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) HPT requested that KDP and PUK representatives </p><p>provide humanitarian </p><p>mapping information, and outlined U.S. plans to contribute to </p><p>the UN,s funding </p><p>appeal.  KDP and PUK representatives will provide </p><p>humanitarian mapping information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) PUK and KDP representatives said they did not expect </p><p>many IDPs to cross </p><p>the Turkish or Iranian borders.  They told HPT that the GOT </p><p>had not consulted </p><p>them on plans for Turkish camps.  They expressed concern that </p><p>if the USG </p><p>prepositions supplies outside Iraq, these materials might not </p><p>get to the </p><p>population that needs them as neighboring governments play </p><p>politics.  They </p><p>requested that the USG pre-position supplies in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) Meeting with the HPT, TRC President Ertan Gonen said </p><p>that, using 60 </p><p>percent of its capacity, TRC could shelter and feed 80,000 to </p><p>100,000 IDPs in a </p><p>10-kilometer buffer zone in northern Iraq.  Note:  In other </p><p>channels, the Turks </p><p>have posited a zone that goes significantly beyond 10 km. </p><p>End Note.  If </p><p>ordered to do so by the GOT, TRC could, by dedicating all of </p><p>its resources to </p><p>the border area, take care of 250,000 to 300,000 </p><p>refugees/IDPs.  Gonen said </p><p>that he wanted to share the costs of pre-positioning stocks </p><p>with the UN </p><p>agencies.  In response to a question from HPT about unmet </p><p>needs in the </p><p>contingency plan, Gonen replied that TRC had a shortage of </p><p>tents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) Gonen maintained that TRC will coordinate all relief </p><p>efforts along </p><p>Turkey,s border with Iraq, including the buffer zone, and </p><p>that ICRC had the </p><p>responsibility for coordinating NGO access in any zone of </p><p>conflict.  He claimed </p><p>that ICRC, IFRC and the GOT had agreed on these arrangements. </p><p> Gonen </p><p>insisted that all supplies going through Turkey be given to </p><p>the TRC and that </p><p>TRC would run the IDP camps in northern Iraq.  Greene </p><p>responded that it was not </p><p>our understanding that ICRC had taken on the NGO coordination </p><p>mandate, and that ICRC,s role would likely be very limited </p><p>in duration given the likelihood of a short period </p><p>of military operations.  Garvelink stated that USG </p><p>pre-positioning was underway </p><p>at warehouses in Italy and that the DART team would follow up </p><p>on our ability to </p><p>fill gaps in supplies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IFRC and American Red Cross </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) HPT discussed the HA situation on January 29 with </p><p>Carl Naucler, Head of </p><p>Delegation, International Federation of Red Cross and Red </p><p>Crescent Societies </p><p>and Ian O\'Donnell, Head of Delegation, American Red Cross. </p><p>Naucler opined that </p><p>few Iraqis would try to cross into Turkey.  While he said </p><p>IFRC was prepared to </p><p>work with TRC on Turkish territory, he emphasized that the </p><p>organization would </p><p>not support TRC operations in northern Iraq and recommended </p><p>that HPT discuss </p><p>the issue of TRC,s intentions with the ICRC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraqi Turkmen Front </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) Dr. Mustafa Ziya, Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) </p><p>Representative, and Hasan </p><p>Osman, Turkmeneli Foundation, told HPT that the ITF had </p><p>planned for a camp </p><p>which could accommodate 5,000 persons in Koi Sanjak near the </p><p>old cease-fire </p><p>line between the PUK and KDP regions.  The Turkmen have </p><p>received funding from </p><p>the TRC, GOT and some Turkish and foreign NGOs.  Ziya </p><p>expressed concern about </p><p>the possibility that the GOI would destroy the Kirkuk/Mosul </p><p>oil fields, </p><p>creating a humanitarian disaster that could generate as many </p><p>as one million </p><p>IDPs in northern Iraq.  He also said that the ITF and PUK </p><p>were cooperating in </p><p>the distribution of aid to IDPs in the PUK area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UN Agencies </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) HPT discussed UN contingency planning and UN </p><p>relations with Turkish </p><p>authorities with Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, UN Resident </p><p>Coordinator in Turkey, </p><p>Gesche Karrenbrock, UN High Commissioner for Refugees </p><p>Representative, John </p><p>Murray, World Food Program, and Edmond McLoughney, United </p><p>Nations Children,s </p><p>Fund Representative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) Witschi-Cestari stated that the UN agencies planned </p><p>to preposition </p><p>supplies and set up an office in Silopi, and to establish a </p><p>crisis coordination </p><p>center in Diyarbakir.  In the event of military action, UN </p><p>expatriate staff </p><p>will evacuate and coordination of activities will take place </p><p>from Cyprus, but </p><p>the UN,s intention is to return to Iraq as quickly as the </p><p>security situation </p><p>allows. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. (C) Mandate for Iraq:  Witschi-Cestari highlighted the </p><p>absence of a mandate </p><p>for either GOT or UN Turkey activities in Iraq, saying that a </p><p>clear legal framework was necessary to provide relief to Iraq </p><p>via Turkey.  The UN will need Security Council approval for </p><p>it to operate in Iraq, particularly in an area controlled by </p><p>us while the current regime is still in place.  The UN and </p><p>the GOT are working on an MOU which would allow the UN to run </p><p>a supply pipeline through Turkey into northern Iraq and </p><p>possibly run cross-border operations.  This MOU would indeed </p><p>include considerations for NGOs.  Witschi-Cestari </p><p>characterized the GOT as cooperative on humanitarian </p><p>planning, but he said the GOT has not gone on a crisis </p><p>footing yet and is resisting establishment of a crisis </p><p>center.  He </p><p>added that the UN agencies had not discussed the issue with </p><p>the Turkish </p><p>military and asked for U.S. help in establishing contact with </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28. (C) UNICEF:  McLoughney stated that UNICEF played a large </p><p>role in OFF </p><p>procurement, especially in northern Iraq, and that UNICEF had </p><p>pre-positioned </p><p>some supplies there, including winter clothes for children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. (C) WFP:  Murray reported that WFP was working with MFA </p><p>to reestablish an </p><p>official presence in Turkey, but faced some hurdles in the </p><p>Turkish </p><p>bureaucracy.  WFP has a logistics office in Ankara, a field </p><p>office in Silopi </p><p>(and is also seeking warehouse space there) and is operating </p><p>warehouses in </p><p>Iskenderun and Gaziantep to store high energy biscuits and </p><p>vegetable oil.  WFP </p><p>has also arranged to draw on strategic wheat stocks from the </p><p>Syrian </p><p>Government.  WFP asked the GOT to consider a similar </p><p>arrangement, but has not </p><p>yet received a response.  WFP is concerned about transport </p><p>restrictions on the </p><p>road from Gaziantep to the Syrian border.  WFP,s planning is </p><p>based on the need </p><p>to feed 80,000 refugees in Turkey as well as an additional </p><p>50,000 in northern </p><p>Iraq.  Karrenbrock said that UNHCR is working closely with </p><p>TRC to prepare to </p><p>handle a crisis on this scale, with a target of basic </p><p>preparedness by February </p><p>15.  For the whole of Iraq, WFP is undertaking </p><p>pre-positioning of rations to </p><p>support 900,000 persons for 10 weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>30. (C) NGOs:  Karrenbrock stated that UNHCR was establishing </p><p>contacts between </p><p>NGOs, TRC and MFA.  She opined that NGOs would be able to </p><p>work in both Turkey </p><p>and Iraq once the mandates for all parties were made clear. </p><p>Witschi-Cestari </p><p>pointed out that, while the GOT was still wary of NGOs, the </p><p>Turks had become </p><p>much more receptive to foreign help following their help in </p><p>responding to the </p><p>1999 earthquakes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>31. (C) Humanitarian Mapping:  Witschi-Cestari said that he </p><p>was aware of the </p><p>U.S. initiative to collect information on humanitarian sites </p><p>and personnel in </p><p>Iraq and that UN provision of information on this was </p><p>centralized at UNSECOORD.  He added, however, that the </p><p>individual agencies would verify the completeness of </p><p>information with UNSECOORD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Embassy Follow-up </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>32. (C) Post,s MDRO is working closely with other Mission </p><p>and ODC elements to </p><p>follow-up on the humanitarian issues raised in the HPT visit, </p><p>and particularly </p><p>to help AID,s Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) </p><p>establish a presence in </p><p>Ankara and possibly Diyarbakir.  Embassy will continue to </p><p>meet with MFA and other GOT elements to  follow up on a range </p><p>of issues, including:  stepped-up HA consultations </p><p>bilaterally and with international humanitarian organizations </p><p>and NGOs and the Turkish military; urging the GOT to </p><p>establish a crisis coordination center; pressing for </p><p>Turkey,s support for unimpeded access into Iraq for UN </p><p>agencies and NGOs delivering relief; and pre-positioning of </p><p>1million humanitarian daily rations (HDRs) in Turkey, among </p><p>other issues.  We have already held a followup meeting with </p><p>MFA (ref B). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
