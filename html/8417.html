Cumhuriyet/Turkiye/Evrensel: Tension rose </p><p>between a group of soldiers on leave in downtown </p><p>Tunceli and private citizens yesterday. Around </p><p>two thousand people gathered in the city\'s main </p><p>square and shouted, "peace could not be </p><p>disrupted; Dersim (Tunceli) would became a grave </p><p>to fascism; [and] Damn Jitem (jandarma </p><p>Intelligence Center." When the quarrel between </p><p>the soldiers and locals turned into a fight, one </p><p>of the soldiers fetched a long-barreled weapon </p><p>from the Jandarma Central Command and started </p><p>shooting at random.  He broke the some windows of </p><p>buildings and damaged some cars; his colleagues </p><p>finally stopped him.  The police did not </p><p>intervene in the incident in order not to magnify </p><p>the event. In the meantime, Tunceli Governor Ali </p><p>Cafer Akyuz announced from municipal loudspeakers </p><p>that an unwanted incident had burst out in town. </p><p>The governor added that action was taken against </p><p>the perpetrators, and called upon everybody to be </p><p>calm. The crowd dispersed after the governor\'s </p><p>announcement. Regional Jandarma Commander Sakir </p><p>Altinbas claimed one soldier was beaten in the </p><p>course of the quarrel, and added that legal and </p><p>administrative actions were initiated against the </p><p>soldier who had opened fire in the air. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Turkiye: Two brothers, Yunus (14) and Idris </p><p>Uzun (17), were killed when they tried to open a </p><p>mortar found near Bingol at their home. Their </p><p>younger brother, Onur Uzun, was also wounded. </p><p>Onur was taken to Firat University Hospital in </p><p>Elazig. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Evrensel: The police arrested two students in </p><p>the Hani township of Diyarbakir on the grounds of </p><p>making insinuating remarks in Kurdish to their </p><p>female teacher during Children\'s Day celebrations </p><p>on April 23. Based upon the teacher\'s complaint, </p><p>two policemen from the Hani Security Directorate </p><p>detained the students. It is claimed the police </p><p>beat the students in a cell in the basement of </p><p>the security directorate and placed human </p><p>excrement to the faces of the two students. </p><p>According to reports, the police then toured the </p><p>students in town and exhibited them to the </p><p>public. The students\' attorney, Mehmet Zulfu </p><p>Dundar, described the incident as "shameful." </p><p>Dundar said they would sue the policemen in </p><p>coming days. Because of the petition filed by the </p><p>teacher, the students are charged with </p><p>molestation. The next hearing has been adjourned </p><p>for June 4. Regarding the issue, the teacher and </p><p>the two policemen said they could not make any </p><p>announcement because they were public employees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Turkiye: The basic price announced for wheat </p><p>by TMO (Soil Products Office) received negative </p><p>reaction from the farmers in the Cukurova plain. </p><p>TMO announced the price for a kilo of wheat is </p><p>approximately 0.22 USD. The merchants are buying </p><p>wheat from the market at 0.24 USD per kilo. The </p><p>farmers\' expectation of the basic price was 0.27 </p><p>or 0.28 USD per kilo. Regarding the issue, the </p><p>Adana Farmers\' Union President, Cumali Dogru, </p><p>said the government left the farmers to their own </p><p>destiny. Dogru added that the wheat from Cukurova </p><p>plain deserved a basic price of not less than </p><p>0.25 US dollar per kilo. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
