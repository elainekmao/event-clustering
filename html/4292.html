BOGOTA 9881 </p><p>     B. BOGOTA 9640 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) ON NOVEMBER 11, THE PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN </p><p>BISHOPS CONFERENCE (CELAM) AND BISHOP OF ZIPAQUIRA, JORGE </p><p>ENRIQUE JIMENEZ, WAS KIDNAPPED IN A RURAL AREA NEAR PACHO, </p><p>CUNDINAMARCA.  TWO ARMED MEN KIDNAPPED THE BISHOP ALONG WITH </p><p>A PARISH PRIEST.  THE 60 YEAR-OLD JIMENEZ WAS TRAVELING TO </p><p>SAN ANTONIO DE AGUILERA TO PRESIDE OVER A CONFIRMATION </p><p>CEREMONY.  ARMY 13TH BRIGADE COMMANDER GENERAL CARLOS ALBERTO </p><p>OSPINA ATTRIBUTED THE KIDNAPPING TO THE FARC.  THE FARC\'S </p><p>22ND FRONT OPERATES IN THE AREA WHERE THE BISHOP WAS ABDUCTED. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THIS IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF TERRORIST ATTACKS BY </p><p>THE FARC (AS WELL AS THE ELN) AGAINST ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOPS </p><p>AND PRIESTS.  IN MARCH, THE ARCHBISHOP OF CALI, ISAIAS DUARTE </p><p>CANCINO, WAS ASSASSINATED.  MORE RECENTLY, IN OCTOBER, THE </p><p>FARC GUNNED DOWN A PARISH PRIEST AS HE WAS LEAVING HIS </p><p>RESIDENCE IN CHALAN, SUCRE (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE FARC HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT A KIDNAPPING CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST RELIGIOUS AND GOVERNMENT FIGURES IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>PRESSURE THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION TO EXCHANGE THEM FOR </p><p>CONVICTED FARC PRISONERS.  NGO\'S AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF KIDNAP </p><p>VICTIMS HAVE FLOATED SEVERAL EXCHANGE PROPOSALS.  WILLIAM </p><p>VELEZ, PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ALSO HAS A </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR A ONE-TIME EXCHANGE.  THE FARC PRISONERS WOULD </p><p>BE SENT TO A THIRD COUNTRY AND NOT BE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO </p><p>COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) COMMENT: BY FOCUSING ON ELITE RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS, THE FARC IS TRYING TO INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THERE HAVE BEEN INDICATIONS IN THE PRESS THAT </p><p>THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING THE VELEZ PROPOSAL </p><p>(REF A).  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p></p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
