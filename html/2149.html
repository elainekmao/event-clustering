<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 003330 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPTARTMENT FOR AF/S, MARK SCHLACHTER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/07/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY HOLDS FORTH ON </p><p>         ELECTION OBSERVATION, OTHER ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM REWHITEHEAD DUE TO 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  ON NOVEMBER 6, AMBASSADOR PAID AN </p><p>INITIAL COURTESY CALL ON WILLARD CHIWEWE, PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY (AND THIRD-RANKING OFFICER) AT THE MINISTRY OF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  AFTER INITIAL EXCHANGES ON THE WAR </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM AND GOZ COOPERATION IN PROTECTING </p><p>AMCITS AFFECTED BY THE FAST-TRACK LAND ACQUISITION </p><p>PROGRAM, THE SUBJECT TURNED TO ELECTION OBSERVATION AND </p><p>THE ROLE OF IFES.  CHIWEWE REACTED WITH A RAMBLING </p><p>LECTURE ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>MOTIVES THAT AT MOMENTS BORDERED ON THE PARANOID.  THE </p><p>MEETING CONCLUDED ON A GENTLER NOTE, WITH CHIWEWE </p><p>DESCRIBING HIS LOVE OF THE LAND AND HIS SHORTCOMINGS IN </p><p>THE ART OF DIPLOMATIC DISCOURSE, WITH WHICH WE HEARTILY </p><p>AGREE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>THE WAR ON TERROR AND SECURITY ISSUES </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR OPENED THE EXCHANGE BY RAISING </p><p>SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES DISCUSSED WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>DURING THE PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS IN OCTOBER.  HE </p><p>EXPRESSED USG SATISFACTION WITH THE GOOD COOPERATION OF </p><p>THE POLICE AND CIO ON TERRORISM RELATED ISSUES.  HE </p><p>OBSERVED THAT IN AN EARLIER MEETING, SPEAKER OF THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT MNANGAGWA HAD URGED THAT THE U.S. CONCLUDE </p><p>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM QUICKLY.  OBVIOUSLY, WE </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO SEE SUCH AN OUTCOME, BUT BY ITS NATURE THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL APPROACH TO THIS COMPLEX PROBLEM MUST BY </p><p>THOROUGH AND NOT DEPEND ON INSTANT SOLUTIONS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR CITED THE UN COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS </p><p>THAT THE GOZ HAS NOT YET RATIFIED AND EXPRESSED OUR HOPE </p><p>THAT THE MFA CAN MOVE QUICKLY TO GET THESE BEFORE </p><p>PARLIAMENT, SINCE THEY ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO THWART TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE EMBASSY HAD NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03330  01 OF 02  071017Z </p><p>YET GOTTEN FINAL MFA PERMISSION TO ERECT A SECURITY </p><p>FENCE AROUND OUR VERY EXPOSED PARKING LOT, ALTHOUGH WE </p><p>HAD RECEIVED ENCOURAGING NEWS THAT THIS WAS UNDER </p><p>CONSIDERATION.  CHIWEWE, WHO HAD BEEN MUTE TO THIS </p><p>POINT, REPLIED THAT HE THOUGHT THAT THIS ISSUE HAD BEEN </p><p>RESOLVED.  HE OBSERVED THAT THIS ALSO INVOLVED LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT, THEN INSTRUCTED AMERICAS DESK OFFICER </p><p>CHIBUWE, THE NOTE TAKER, TO FOLLOW UP. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>AMCIT COOPERATION </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR SAID WE ALSO APPRECIATED RECENT </p><p>EFFORTS BY THE MFA TO ASSIST AMERICAN CITIZENS WHOSE </p><p>DWELLINGS AND PROPERTY HAD BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY </p><p>EVENTS IN THE COUNTRY.  EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION BY THE </p><p>MFA HAD HELPED RESOLVE THESE CASES.  CHIWEWE REMAINED </p><p>SPHINX-LIKE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVATION AND IFES </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR NEXT RAISED THE ISSUE OF </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVATION SPECIFICALLY AS IT PERTAINED TO </p><p>IFES.  HE REFERRED TO THE EXCELLENT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>REPUTATION (AND INTERNATIONAL CONTACTS) THAT IFES ENJOYS </p><p>AND BRIEFLY DESCRIBED THE ABORTIVE ATTEMPT BY IFES STAFF </p><p>TO UNDERTAKE AN INITIAL ELECTIONS ASSESSMENT.  HE </p><p>OBSERVED THAT A DEFINITIVE GOZ ANSWER ON WHEN IFES CAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03330  01 OF 02  071017Z </p><p>BECOME INVOLVED WOULD BE POSITIVE.  HE ADDED THAT IFES </p><p>WAS INTERESTED IN AN OBSERVATION RATHER THAN MONITORING </p><p>ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE NEW SUBJECT MATTER ANIMATED CHIWEWE </p><p>CONSIDERABLY.  HE LAUNCHED INTO A LONG AND AT TIME </p><p>PARANOID LECTURE QUESTIONING THE EAGERNESS OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BECOME INVOLVED IN ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>ELECTIONS, WHICH THE GOZ TOOK TO BE INTERFERENCE.  HE </p><p>CITED THE "COINCIDENCE" THAT THE EU HAD "DEMANDED" -- </p><p>BUT NOW WERE REDUCED TO "REQUESTING" -- A SIMILAR </p><p>RESPONSE.  THIS HAD TO DO WITH THE OPPOSITION PARTY THAT </p><p>HAD ATTRACTED INTERNATIONAL INTEREST AND WAS BEING </p><p>"NURSED BY DOMINANT INTERESTS".  THE GOZ VIEWED SUCH </p><p>REQUESTS AGAINST THIS BACKDROP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  AMERICANS DON\'T VOTE HERE, BUT THEY DO </p><p>RETAIN STRONG INTEREST IN UNIVERSAL DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PRINCIPLES.  CHIWEWE WAS OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN, ARGUING </p><p>THAT AMERICAN REBELLION AGAINST THE COLONIAL CROWN MEANT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8114 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03330  02 OF 02  071018Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   NSAE-00  EPAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------3B072F  071018Z /38 </p><p>P 070936Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0228 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003330 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPTARTMENT FOR AF/S, MARK SCHLACHTER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/07/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY HOLDS FORTH ON </p><p>         ELECTION OBSERVATION, OTHER ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>THAT OUR TWO COUNTRIES COME FROM THE SAME IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>ORIGIN.  ZIMBABWE WANTS TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THOSE WHO </p><p>PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND HOLD FAIR LAW AND THE PRINCIPLES </p><p>OF JUSTICE DEAR.  WE SHOULD HAVE NO DOUBT THAT GOZ </p><p>LEADERSHIP, AND PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS PARTY, ARE </p><p>COMMITTED TO FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CHIWEWE FILIBUSTERED AT LENGTH ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03330  02 OF 02  071018Z </p><p>HISTORY OF ELECTIONS SINCE 1980, EMPHASIZING THAT THEY </p><p>HAD RECEIVED A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH DURING THE </p><p>MARXIST/LENINIST PERIOD FROM 1980-1991.  HE SNORTED THAT </p><p>SINCE 1999 A LOT OF CASH HAD BEEN INVESTED IN A NEW </p><p>PARTY, AND THE INVESTORS WERE ANXIOUS THAT THE </p><p>"POLITICAL ELECTIONS GUARANTEE SOLID DIVIDENDS".  HE </p><p>CITED THE WESTMINSTER FOUNDATION AS A CHIEF CULPRIT AND </p><p>ASKED HOW ZIMBABWE COULD EXPECT HONEST OBSERVERS FROM </p><p>SUCH BIASED GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) CHIWEWE SAID THAT THE IFES AND EU REQUESTS HAD </p><p>TO BE EXAMINED FROM THIS OPTIC.  HE EXPLAINED THAT "THE </p><p>CONTEXT IS NOT OBJECTIVE".   WHY IS THE U.S. TAKING </p><p>SIDES INSTEAD OF PLAYING THE HONEST BROKER, AS IT HAD AT </p><p>LANCASTER HOUSE?   THE GOZ FEARED PRE-JUDGMENT.  HE </p><p>CONCLUDED BY STRESSING THAT THE GOZ HAD ALWAYS INVITED </p><p>OBSERVERS, SO WHY WERE THE USUAL GUESTS ASKING FOR AN </p><p>INVITATION THIS TIME AROUND?  ZIMBABWE HAD NO ELECTORAL </p><p>SKELETONS IN THE CUPBOARD.  SOMETIMES THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY CREATES CONDITIONS TO FORCE OTHERS TO ASK </p><p>SOMETHING, AND THEREBY CREATE CONDITIONS TO CONDEMN. </p><p>THE EU WAS USING ARTICLE 96 CONSULTATIONS TO TRY AND </p><p>FORCE ZIMBABWE TO AGREE TO EU DEMANDS.  THIS ASSUMED </p><p>EUROPEAN AUTHORITY OVER ZIMBABWEANS AND REMINDED THEM OF </p><p>THE SAD PAST. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>CHIWEWE ON CHIWEWE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) CHIWEWE LIGHTENED UP CONSIDERABLY ON THE SUBJECT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03330  02 OF 02  071018Z </p><p>OF HIMSELF.  HE VOLUNTEERED THAT HE SPOKE FRANKLY.  SOME </p><p>CALLED HIS HONEST STYLE RUDE OR EVEN AGGRESSIVE, BUT IT </p><p>HAD SERVED HIM WELL IN HIS ROLE AS A PEACEMAKER IN THE </p><p>RENAMO/FRELIMO RAPPROCHEMENT.  HE NOTED OUT OF THE BLUE </p><p>THAT HE WAS UNREACHABLE 99 PERCENT OF THE TIME ON </p><p>WEEKENDS BECAUSE BE WAS GARDENING AT HIS RURAL HOME IS </p><p>MASVINGO.  HE CONTINUED THAT HE SPOKE NOT AS A </p><p>BUREAUCRAT, BUT AS "SOME SORT OF SCIENTIST".  AS A </p><p>CLOSER, HE PROCLAIMED THAT THERE WAS FERTILE GROUND FOR </p><p>RICH BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND THE U.S., </p><p>AND EVEN ZIMBABWE AND THE UK. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE MEETING WAS AT TIMES AMUSING, IF NOT </p><p>PARTICULARLY ENLIGHTENING.  CHIWEWE\'S ROLE AS FRONT MAN </p><p>IN DEALING WITH THE EU ON ARTICLE 8 CONSULTATIONS IS </p><p>PROBABLY AS GOOD AN EXPLANATION AS ANY FOR THE EU MOVING </p><p>TO ARTICLE 96.  HE IS CLEARLY A MAN WHO RELISHES HIS </p><p>ROLE AS CEREBUS GUARDING THE GATES FOR ZANU-PF, AND IS </p><p>DETERMINED NOT TO YIELD THIS SINECURE WITHOUT A TUSSLE. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
