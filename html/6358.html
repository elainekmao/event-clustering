<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000468 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Political Parties, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S TOP POLITICOS SHUN PM; PUSH FOR ALL-PARTY </p><p>GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0426 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0292 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On March 10 leaders of most political parties </p><p>boycotted for the second time an all-party meeting called by </p><p>interim Prime Minister Chand.  One day later, 11 left-wing </p><p>parties, including the Maoists, met to discuss "a joint </p><p>movement" against Chand\'s government.  King Gyanendra met </p><p>separately with leaders of most major political parties on </p><p>March 10 and 11.  In at least one of these meetings, the King </p><p>reportedly hinted at dissatisfaction with the performance of </p><p>the interim government, thereby presumably opening the </p><p>possibility of a replacement.  On March 12 the leaders of the </p><p>two largest political parties agreed to press the King either </p><p>to reinstate Parliament or establish an all-party government </p><p>to replace the Chand government.  The parties\' continued </p><p>opposition to the Chand government and increasingly unified </p><p>stand may increase pressure on the Palace to consider an </p><p>all-party government.  The Maoists, however, are likely to </p><p>object strongly to such a government if it is headed by the </p><p>moderate Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(UML).  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>PARTIES MEET KING; </p><p>SHUN CHAND </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On March 10 and 11 King Gyanendra met separately </p><p>with the leaders of most political parties that had members </p><p>in the previous Parliament.  (Note:  The King did not meet </p><p>with the heads of the National Democratic Party and the Nepal </p><p>Sadbhavana Party, the parties of the Prime Minister and </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister respectively, as they are already </p><p>represented in the interim government.  Amik Sherchan, leader </p><p>of the far-left People\'s Front Nepal, declined the King\'s </p><p>invitation because it did not satisfy the parties\' previous </p><p>request to meet the monarch as a group.  End note.)  In his </p><p>March 11 meeting with Sher Bahadur Deuba, former Prime </p><p>Minister and current head of the Nepali Congress </p><p>(Democratic), the King "conveyed the impression that he is </p><p>not satisfied with the current government" of Prime Minister </p><p>Lokendra Bahadur Chand, according to Minendra Rijal, a Deuba </p><p>confidante, and hinted at the possibility of an all-party </p><p>government.  Deuba reportedly told the King that he would </p><p>participate, if asked, in such a government.  Deuba\'s party </p><p>has not formed "a firm opinion" regarding prospects for </p><p>peace, Rijal said, since "we don\'t know what arrangements </p><p>(have been made) between the King and the Maoists" and are </p><p>thus only "second-guessing the Government." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  While nearly all of the parties accepted the King\'s </p><p>invitation to meet, none (except the National Democratic </p><p>Party and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party) extended similar </p><p>courtesy to PM Chand on March 10, when they boycotted for the </p><p>second time in two months an all-party meeting he called to </p><p>discuss propsective negotiations with the Maoists.  The local </p><p>independent press reporting the boycott accorded prominent </p><p>coverage to party leaders\' derisive characterizations of the </p><p>Chand government ("unconstitutional," "illegitimate," </p><p>"puppet") to justify their decisions to stay away.  With so </p><p>many no-shows, an all-party meeting originally intended to </p><p>discuss how the interim government can bring the Maoists into </p><p>the political mainstream focused instead on how the interim </p><p>government could induce parties already in the political </p><p>mainstream to recognize its legitimacy. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>LEFT-WING UNITY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On March 11 Madhav Kumar Nepal, General Secretary </p><p>of the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(UML), hosted a meeting of representatives of 11 far-left </p><p>parties, including the Maoists--the first time all 11 parties </p><p>had met together since the early 1990s, according to one </p><p>participant.  (Note:  Only 3 of the 11 had representatives in </p><p>the most recent Parliament.  End note.)  C.P. Mainali, </p><p>Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal - Marxist Leninist </p><p>(ML), who attended the meeting, said Nepal proposed the </p><p>formation of an all-party government to replace the current </p><p>non-party government.  All of the legal party participants </p><p>supported the proposal, Mainali reported.  Maoist </p><p>representative Dinanath Sharma said he must seek his </p><p>leadership\'s permission before making a commitment, but </p><p>pledged support for "progressive change," including the </p><p>parties\' "united move" to protest the King\'s "regressive </p><p>action" (i.e., his appointment of a non-party interim </p><p>government in October).  The proposal must be approved by the </p><p>three political forces--the King, the parties, and the </p><p>Maoists--if it is to work, Mainali noted.  He said he is </p><p>optimistic that both the Palace and the Maoists, who he said </p><p>do not recognize the Chand government, will accept the </p><p>proposal.  The Maoists would not be able to participate </p><p>directly in the envisioned all-party government, Mainali </p><p>said, but could perhaps nominate surrogate representatives </p><p>from legal far-left parties sympathetic to them.  Whether the </p><p>Maoists would accept an all-party government headed by Madhav </p><p>Nepal is a "difficult question," Mainali conceded, but </p><p>suggested that the contentious question of leadership could </p><p>be amicably sorted out once the Maoists endorse the concept </p><p>of an all-party government. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>KOIRALA CLIMBS DOWN </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  In a show of unprecedented unity, on March 12 the </p><p>leaders of four Parliamentary parties, including UML General </p><p>Secretary Nepal and Nepali Congress President G.P. Koirala, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>announced that they would support replacing the Chand </p><p>government with either an all-party government (Nepal\'s </p><p>preferred option) or through the reinstatement of Parliament </p><p>(Koirala\'s pet proposal).  (Note:  Although the National </p><p>Democratic Party did not attend that meeting, its leadership </p><p>has indicated privately it would join an all-party </p><p>government.  End note.)   The leaders said they will seek a </p><p>joint meeting with the King to explain their proposals, and </p><p>will foster public support and pressure through a series of </p><p>mass meetings.  The statement marks the first time Nepali </p><p>Congress President Koirala has compromised on his previously </p><p>rigid stand that Parliament must be reinstated. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Before March 12 the Parliamentary parties (minus the </p><p>PM\'s National Democratic and the Deputy PM\'s Nepal Sadbhavana </p><p>Parties) had been united only in their opposition to the </p><p>Chand government.  Disagreement over what (or, more </p><p>accurately, who) would replace the King\'s appointed Cabinet </p><p>had prevented the formation of a unified multipartisan front. </p><p> The Nepali Congress\' Koirala had been especially rigid in </p><p>his near-monomaniacal insistence on reinstating Parliament. </p><p>As long as the parties remained divided, the Palace could </p><p>more easily dismiss their complaints about the "illegitimate" </p><p>interim government by citing their failure to propose a </p><p>workable alternative.  The parties\' new-found unity and </p><p>Koirala\'s atypical compromise will make this more difficult. </p><p>The multi-partisan unity, if it lasts, will also complicate </p><p>matters for the Maoists, who had thrived on the partisan </p><p>strife of the domestic political arena over the past decade. </p><p>We agree with Mainali\'s analysis that the all-party proposal </p><p>must win the approval of the Palace, parties, and the Maoists </p><p>in order to succeed, but are less sanguine that the </p><p>all-important question of who would lead this government may </p><p>not prove a deal-breaker.  Despite the lip service to </p><p>"progressive change" the Maoist representative offered in his </p><p>meeting with the left parties, we sincerely doubt the </p><p>insurgents would welcome any "progressive change" that </p><p>results in a government led by its arch enemy, the UML. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
