<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001736 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USUN NEW YORK PLEASE PASS TO SA A/S ROCCA </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-17-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, PINS, SOCI, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Peace process update:  Positive response to </p><p>talks; President hits out; Possible prisoner exchange </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 1719; (B) Colombo 1629 (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process reviews </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Kickoff of peace talks in Thailand engenders highly </p><p>positive response in Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>-- Before start of talks, President Kumaratunga hits out </p><p>at GSL </p><p> </p><p>-- Government and Tamil Tigers working closely on </p><p>prisoner exchange </p><p> </p><p>-- The flavor of the peace process:  Christian pilgrims </p><p>visit shrine in LTTE-controlled area en masse </p><p> </p><p>=================================== </p><p>Sri Lankans respond warmly to talks </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The kickoff of peace talks between the </p><p>government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) in Thailand on September 16 was greeted warmly in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  Observers -- both Sinhalese and Tamil -- </p><p>told us they thought the opening ceremony set an </p><p>excellent tone for the talks.  Joseph Parajahsingham, a </p><p>pro-LTTE Tamil MP, told us that "it was very encouraging </p><p>to see both sides talking about ending the war and </p><p>coming to a negotiated settlement."  Desmond Fernando, a </p><p>well-known Sinhalese lawyer, told us that "the important </p><p>thing is that the two sides are meeting after seven </p><p>years."  (Note:  The last time the two sides sat down </p><p>for formal face-to-face talks was in early 1995.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Press coverage was also positive.  Newspapers, </p><p>both vernacular and English language, gave extensive </p><p>coverage to the opening ceremony, as did TV and radio. </p><p>Probably the most circulated photos and video clips </p><p>involved shots of chief GSL negotiator G.L. Peiris </p><p>standing side-by-side with chief LTTE negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham -- with both smiling amicably.  Newspapers </p><p>also carried long excerpts from the speeches given at </p><p>the opening ceremony by Peiris and Balasingham (see </p><p>Ref A).  Articles took note of the eloquence of Peiris\' </p><p>speech ("...a sea change is necessary, now that the </p><p>tempests have abated...") and Balasingham\'s </p><p>straightforward remarks welcoming the talks. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) (((Note:  The coverage of the talks on the </p><p>pro-LTTE website "TamilNet" was also generally positive. </p><p>TamilNet welcomed the start of the talks and carried </p><p>several photos of the opening ceremony.  In line with </p><p>the often-acerbic public style of the LTTE, however, the </p><p>site also took digs at "Sinhalese hard-liners led by </p><p>President Kumaratunga."  In what is becoming a LTTE </p><p>mantra, the site also demanded that the GSL provide more </p><p>assistance to the north and east.))) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  Despite the positive vibes, Sri </p><p>Lankans do not seem worked up or overly enthusiastic </p><p>about the talks.  Sri Lanka has been through numerous </p><p>peace process iterations in the past.  Each has failed </p><p>and usually been followed by large-scale violence. </p><p>Given this sorry record, people seem relatively </p><p>realistic and disinclined to set expectations too high. </p><p>That said, although there seems a depth of patience, </p><p>there is a feeling that this version of the peace </p><p>process needs to succeed for the sake of the country\'s </p><p>long-term prosperity.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>================== </p><p>President Hits Out </p><p>================== </p><p>6.  (SBU) Shortly before the government delegation left </p><p>Sri Lanka for Thailand, President Kumaratunga took the </p><p>opportunity to lash out at the GSL over its handling of </p><p>the peace process.  In a long letter dated September 12 </p><p>that was issued to the press, Kumaratunga alleged that </p><p>the government was doing little to stop the LTTE from </p><p>violating the February ceasefire accord.  In a </p><p>subsequent speech, Kumaratunga also went on to enunciate </p><p>strong support for the peace process, as long as her </p><p>letter\'s concerns were met.  Defense Minister Marapana </p><p>immediately responded to Kumaratunga\'s letter, flatly </p><p>rejecting the notion that the GSL had "permitted" the </p><p>LTTE to engage in serious violations of the ceasefire </p><p>accord. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment:  Kumaratunga seems to be on the losing </p><p>side of this argument:  The Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) reported on September 13 that </p><p>ceasefire accord violations were drastically down in </p><p>recent weeks.  The SLMM even stated that "...the </p><p>situation on the ground seems to be in such good order </p><p>that it will support the parties during their initial </p><p>talks in Thailand." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Regarding the talks, Kumratunga is also clearly </p><p>annoyed over the fact that the GSL has not welcomed a </p><p>representative of her party on the government\'s </p><p>negotiating team in Thailand.  Her spokesman, Harim </p><p>Peiris, told us that she thought this was "quite a </p><p>snub."  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>Possible Prisoner Exchange </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) With Norwegian government facilitation, the </p><p>government and the LTTE are heavily engaged in </p><p>negotiating the terms of a possible prisoner exchange. </p><p>The essential elements of the exchange would have the </p><p>LTTE turn over to the GSL the seven Sri Lankan security </p><p>force personnel it claims to have in custody. </p><p>Meanwhile, the GSL would free 14 LTTE personnel, who are </p><p>held in government jails.  It is not clear when the </p><p>exchange might take place, but Taranjit Sandhu, polchief </p><p>of the Indian High Commission, told us that he had heard </p><p>that it might occur right after the end of the first </p><p>round of peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) (((Note:  The LTTE claims that the seven are </p><p>the only prisoners it holds.  According to human rights </p><p>activists, the government holds about 800 Tamils under </p><p>the Prevention of Terrorism Act on grounds that they are </p><p>terrorist operatives linked with the LTTE.  The </p><p>government\'s recent lifting of the ban on the LTTE as an </p><p>organization has had no legal effect on the </p><p>circumstances of these prisoners.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Comment:  The release of prisoners by both </p><p>sides would be a solid confidence-building measure.  It </p><p>is potentially very controversial in the Sinhalese </p><p>south, however.  Already, the GSL has had to drop the </p><p>notion of including several LTTE prisoners in the </p><p>exchange who are believed to have been involved in </p><p>serious acts of terrorism, such as the December 1999 </p><p>attempt to assassinate President Kumaratunga.  Given the </p><p>gathering momentum of the peace process, the possibility </p><p>of a prisoner exchange raises the prospect of a general </p><p>amnesty at some point.  The government has not publicly </p><p>discussed this possibility yet, probably because it is </p><p>too hot too handle.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>====================================== </p><p>LTTE allows visits to important shrine </p><p>====================================== </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Huge numbers of Roman Catholics and other Sri </p><p>Lankans are being allowed to visit a shrine in the town </p><p>of Madhu in the LTTE-controlled Wanni region in northern </p><p>Sri Lanka.  Founded on a site visited by Portuguese </p><p>clergy in the 1600s, Our Lady of the Holy Rosary church </p><p>is the most important shrine in the country for Sri </p><p>Lankan Catholics.  The LTTE gradually opened up access </p><p>to the area in the past several months as the peace </p><p>process gained momentum.  With the loosening of travel </p><p>restrictions, roads in the Madhu area have become </p><p>flooded with pilgrims, with tens of thousands of people </p><p>converging on the site in mid-August for a religious </p><p>feast, for example. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Comment:  The LTTE\'s decision to open up </p><p>access to the shrine has been greatly appreciated by </p><p>Catholics, who represent about seven percent of the </p><p>population, and are an influential group within both the </p><p>Sinhalese and Tamil communities.  It has also been </p><p>lucrative:  the LTTE are apparently reaping considerable </p><p>funds from taxes applied to road use and on the (rustic) </p><p>tourist facilities in the Madhu area.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
