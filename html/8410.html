(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary:  On the heels of a 5/27 meeting between </p><p>Ambassador Neumann and Gulf Air CEO Jim Hogan (reftel), a </p><p>representative from the Abu Dhabi Department of Civil </p><p>Aviation (ADDCA) visited Acting DCM 5/31 to petition for </p><p>Gulf Air to be allowed to commence daily commercial flights </p><p>to Baghdad as soon as possible.  Mohamed Rashed Al- </p><p>Mohanadi, who works for ADDCA Chairman Shaykh Hamdan bin </p><p>Mubarak Al-Nahyan and also serves on Gulf Air\'s Executive </p><p>Board, noted that the UAEG signed an agreement with the </p><p>Government of Iraq in February 1990 for six flights per </p><p>week from the UAE to Baghdad (three flights each for Abu </p><p>Dhabi\'s Gulf Air and Dubai\'s Emirates Air, and a reciprocal </p><p>six flights weekly for Iraq\'s national carrier) but had not </p><p>been able to fully exploit that agreement due to sanctions </p><p>imposed on commercial air traffic to Iraq soon thereafter. </p><p>Gulf Air, and the UAEG more broadly, is seeking to </p><p>reinstate and expand that earlier agreement for daily </p><p>roundtrip flights from the UAE to Baghdad in the short- </p><p>term, and eventual establishment of a UAE-Baghdad-New York </p><p>route in the long-term.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Al-Mohanadi conveyed to Acting DCM the ADDCA\'s </p><p>desire to engage with the relevant authorities in Iraq </p><p>about obtaining landing rights for Gulf Air at Baghdad </p><p>International Airport (BIAP).  ADDCA will concurrently </p><p>approach the UAE federal inter-ministerial committee on </p><p>Iraq\'s economic recovery, which has undertaken to lobby on </p><p>behalf of UAE companies.  (Note: During a 5/31 meeting, </p><p>Emirates Airline CEO Shaykh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum made </p><p>similar comments to Consul General Dubai.  Emirates is </p><p>interested both in flying into Baghdad, and also in </p><p>obtaining overflight rights for Iraq.  Shaykh Ahmed also </p><p>observed that allowing overflights would provide a useful </p><p>revenue stream for the Iraqi Government.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Al-Mohanadi welcomed Acting DCM\'s suggestion to </p><p>contact the IATA Middle East representative, whom we </p><p>understand will represent commercial carriers in </p><p>discussions concerning overflight and landing rights </p><p>issues.  The Emirati official recognized that safety and </p><p>security issues could delay the opening of BIAP for several </p><p>weeks, but was eager now to engage IATA on overflight </p><p>clearances -- which would cut 45 minutes or more from </p><p>flights to Europe from the UAE.  Al-Mohanadi confirmed that </p><p>Gulf Air CEO Jim Hogan is in Washington for the June 2-4 </p><p>IATA meetings, and expected he would be discussing Gulf </p><p>Air\'s interest in Baghdad flights with relevant USG </p><p>officials. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: With more than 50 years of experience in </p><p>the region, Gulf Air is eager to expand its service to </p><p>include Iraq as soon as possible.  Al-Mohanadi queried </p><p>Acting DCM about persistent rumors here that Kuwait Air </p><p>will be the first commercial airline allowed to service </p><p>BIAP -- such a move would not sit well with Gulf Air </p><p>corporate execs or (more importantly) our senior UAEG </p><p>interlocutors.  Abu Dhabi and Dubai view the opening of </p><p>Iraq\'s airports as not only a commercial opportunity, but </p><p>also as an important political symbol.  The UAE wants to be </p><p>first, or among the first, commercial carriers from the </p><p>region to establish a regular (preferably daily) schedule </p><p>to Baghdad, and consequently will have a dim view of any </p><p>move to grant other regional carriers priority.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) This cable has been coordinated with Amconsul </p><p>Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
