According to IRC, there is no public health emergency in </p><p>either Karbala or An Najaf governorates, but local residents </p><p>are suffering from chronic, preventable health problems. </p><p>The DART met with a health representative from Babil to </p><p>discuss ways to solve emergency health problems in Al </p><p>Hillah, specifically remedying poor sanitation conditions at </p><p>the pediatric hospital, and resolving an essential drug </p><p>shortage.  On the food side, according to WFP, Al Hillah has </p><p>abundant amounts of flour in the market, but most Iraqis are </p><p>unable to afford this commodity at current prices. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>IRC IN AL HILLAH </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  In An Najaf, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) </p><p>has assessed 50 of the governorate\'s 59 compact water units </p><p>and found that most need restoration or replacement.  In </p><p>Karbala, IRC said the governorate\'s 42 units were in better </p><p>condition.  After consultation with An Najaf governorate </p><p>water officials, IRC decided to request funds from its </p><p>cooperative agreement with the DART to help improve the </p><p>faulty rural water systems. </p><p> </p><p>3.  "We haven\'t found any public health emergency," IRC said </p><p>of its findings in Karbala and An Najaf governorates. </p><p>However, IRC did find people suffering from preventable, </p><p>chronic health problems, and said it would like to address </p><p>them in its cooperative agreement plan.  It will focus its </p><p>efforts in rural areas, concentrating on maternal child </p><p>health, community health workers, TBAs, health education and </p><p>hygiene, and enhanced pediatric screening. IRC would also </p><p>support communicable disease surveillance and rural </p><p>immunization campaigns, noting that the war disrupted the </p><p>cold chain in some places.  IRC said there was no evidence </p><p>of cholera or typhoid, and that it was unclear whether </p><p>seasonal diarrhea rates had increased. However, IRC said </p><p>there might be some cases of cholera outside of Karbala. </p><p> </p><p>4.  One major problem that IRC encountered was the lack of </p><p>therapeutic milk in pediatric hospitals in An Najaf and </p><p>Karbala.   Infant formula was being used as an alternative, </p><p>although, according to the IRC health specialist, this was </p><p>not a good substitute. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>WFP IN AL HILLAH </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The DART confirmed on 19 May that Coalition forces have </p><p>vacated the main food warehouse in Al Hillah.  However, the </p><p>warehouse remains under the Coalition security.  Wakil </p><p>(public distribution agents) trucks continue to pick up the </p><p>September/October distribution as directed by the Ministry </p><p>of Trade (MOT) and as agreed to by WFP. The distributions </p><p>are being made to supplement earlier distributions that were </p><p>deficient in some food items. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The DART met with WFP national staff in the designated </p><p>WFP office space at the compound.  Neither the WFP nor the </p><p>MOT office spaces are in acceptable condition, and both </p><p>offices are in need of clean up, refurbishment, office </p><p>furniture, computers and supplies. </p><p> </p><p>7.  At the request of MOT warehouse staff, front gate </p><p>military security presently allow two trucks at a time into </p><p>the compound. Although security is willing to allow more </p><p>than two trucks, MOT warehouse staff stated that they did </p><p>not have the personnel to process more than two trucks at a </p><p>time. Approximately 30 trucks per day are receiving </p><p>commodities from the compound. Trucks normally arrive at the </p><p>compound throughout the morning and continue arriving until </p><p>about 1400 hours. </p><p> </p><p>8.  According to WFP staff, current distributions include </p><p>flour, rice, sugar, vegetable oil white beans, detergent, </p><p>soap, tea, salt, and infant formula. They do not have stocks </p><p>of adult milk or weaning cereal, and they are low in </p><p>vegetable oil stocks.  WFP said that MOT would eventually be </p><p>responsible for providing warehouse compound security. Until </p><p>that time, Coalition forces will be required to secure the </p><p>front gate and inspect in-coming vehicles. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WFP stated that Al Hillah has abundant amounts of flour </p><p>in the market; however, most Iraqis are unable to afford </p><p>this commodity at current prices. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WFP officials said they had seen the MOT database for </p><p>Al Hillah and have discussed procedures to process any </p><p>possible beneficiaries who have not been registered or who </p><p>have lost their ration cards. MOT will re-register all </p><p>beneficiaries that have been removed from the rolls or lost </p><p>their ration cards.  These individuals will receive rations </p><p>at the time of distributions.  The DART will confirm the </p><p>specifics of these procedures with MOT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>PAYROLL AND SECURITY UPDATES FROM CMOC </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The DART participated in the Babil Governorate Support </p><p>Team (GST) meeting on 19 May in Al Hillah and received a </p><p>briefing on a scheme to slowly return the task of paying </p><p>salaries to the municipalities.  Bank disbursement managers </p><p>from all governorates will pay salaries via banks as they </p><p>had before the war.  The Coalition military will transport </p><p>the funds to each governorate through June, and hopes to </p><p>turn over disbursement duties to the governorates in time </p><p>for the July payroll. </p><p> </p><p>12.  A Coalition official announced that military police </p><p>(MP) would soon begin a four-day course for police </p><p>training.  The MPs will train a total of 600 police officers </p><p>for Al Hillah, and will follow up by carrying out joint </p><p>patrols.  The GST also announced that it was starting a </p><p>tracking chart of all humanitarian projects in Babil. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>MEETING WITH BABIL CIVIL AFFAIRS HEALTH OFFICIAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>13.  The DART met with the Babil GST health representative </p><p>to discuss ways to solve emergency health problems in Al </p><p>Hillah, specifically remedying poor sanitation conditions at </p><p>the pediatric hospital, and resolving an essential drug </p><p>shortage.  The GST official reported that 70 armed men </p><p>entered Al Hillah\'s general hospital on 18 May and demanded </p><p>that patients receive high-quality care.  Looting was not a </p><p>motive, and details were sketchy.  However, there was </p><p>gunfire in the hospital and two or three people were </p><p>injured.  Doctors there threatened to walk out unless </p><p>security was improved.  Two nights ago, there was a report </p><p>of someone throwing a grenade over the entrance gate of the </p><p>pediatric hospital.   Doctors at the pediatric hospital told </p><p>the DART that many resident doctors lived at the hospital </p><p>rather than risk commuting from their homes.  The Babil </p><p>Ministry of Health identified 72 residents to undergo the </p><p>upcoming "mini" police training and to serve as security </p><p>police for Al Hillah health facilities.  Coalition forces </p><p>carry out periodic patrols at Al Hillah hospitals, but do </p><p>not provide permanent security for them. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
