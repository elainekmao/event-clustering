<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 001328 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE ENCOURAGES CROATIA\'S EU ASPIRATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. POPE JOHN PAUL II VISITED CROATIA BETWEEN JUNE 5-9 -- </p><p>HIS THIRD VISIT TO THIS OVERWHELMINGLY CATHOLIC COUNTRY. </p><p>IN HIS OPENING ADDRESS ON ARRIVAL AT THE RIJEKA AIRPORT </p><p>    THE POPE NOTED THAT "CROATIA RECENTLY SUBMITTED ITS </p><p>APPLICATION TO BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART, BOTH POLITICALY </p><p>AND ECONOMICALLY, OF THE BIG FAMILY OF EUROPEAN NATIONS </p><p>-- I CANNOT BUT EXPECT A DESIRE FOR FAST FULFILLMENT OF </p><p>THESE ASPIRATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>2. THE VISIT DOMINATED THE CROATIAN MEDIA AND WAS </p><p>WITHOUT EXCEPTION PORTRAYED POSITIVELY.  USING RIJEKA AS </p><p>A BASE, THE POPE TRAVELED TO DUBROVNIK AND ZADAR ON THE </p><p>COAST, AND TO OSIJEK AND DJAKOVO IN EASTERN SLAVONIA. </p><p>KEY POLITICAL FIGURES INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT, PRIME </p><p>MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER WELCOMED THE POPE\'S </p><p>MESSAGE OF SUPPORT FOR THE COUNTRY\'S EFFORTS TO JOIN THE </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN OSIJEK THE POPE GREETED A CROWD OF 200,000 AND </p><p>NOTED THAT IN THE AFTERMATH OF WAR, WHICH LEFT DEEP AND </p><p>STILL UNHEALED WOUNDS ON THE POPULATION, IT REQUIRES A </p><p>LOT OF COURAGE TO PROMOTE RECONCILIATION, SOLIDARITY AND </p><p>SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THE PRESENCE OF SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH </p><p>DIGNITARIES WAS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>4. GOC OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT RESTITUTION OF THE </p><p>CHURCH\'S NATIONALIZED PROPERTY WAS NOT ON THE AGENDA IN </p><p>MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT MESIC OR PRIME MINISTER RACAN. </p><p>GORAN GRANIC, A DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND THE GOC POINT </p><p>PERSON FOR RELATIONS WITH THE CHURCH, STATED THAT MANY </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE SIMILAR CLAIMS, BUT </p><p>THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE PRIVILEGED IN THIS PROCESS. </p><p>HOWEVER, PRESS REPORTS IN ADVANCE OF THE VISIT CITED </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH THE CHURCH </p><p>    COULD RECEIVE AS MUCH AS 25 PERCENT OF THE STATE-OWNED </p><p>CROATIA INSURANCE COMPANY AS COMPENSATION FOR A PART OF </p><p>ITS PROPERTY NATIONALIZED UNDER THE COMMUNISTS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. ACCORDING TO IVICA MASTRUKO, PRESIDENT MESIC\'S </p><p>ADVISER FOR RELIGIOUS ISSUES AND CROATIA\'S LONG-SERVING </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE VATICAN, THE POPE\'S SUPPORT FOR </p><p>CROATIA\'S EU ASPIRATIONS WAS PARTICULARLY AIMED TOWARD </p><p>THE LOCAL CHURCH, WHICH HAS BEEN VOCALLY SKEPTICAL OF </p><p>THE GOC\'S EURO-ATLANTIC ASPIRATIONS.  NATIONALIST AND </p><p>ISOLATIONIST TENDENCIES ARE MOST NOTABLE AMONG DALMATIAN </p><p>BISHOPS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE GONE AS FAR AS TO PUBLICLY </p><p>SUPPORT INDICTED WAR CRIMINALS.  WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT </p><p>ANY CHANGES IN THE POLITICAL VIEWS OF LOCAL CHURCH </p><p>OFFICIALS, THE VISIT SHOULD BOOST THE POSITION OF </p><p>ARCHBISHOP JOSIP BOZANIC, CROATIA\'S TOP CHURCH OFFICIAL </p><p>AND A REPUTED MODERATE, WHO HAS A REPUTATION OF BEING </p><p>MORE IN LINE WITH THE VATICAN POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
