<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/29/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY RAISES PAMUKBANK CASE WITH AK VICE CHAIRMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8596 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel.  Reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) We met November 29 with AK Vice Chairman and MP Murat </p><p>Mercan to highlight the risks resulting from the Danistay\'s </p><p>November 22 injunction against BRSA\'s takeover of insolvent </p><p>Pamukbank.  We said the decision, although taken by an </p><p>independent judicial body, undermined the BRSA\'s credibility </p><p>and added to the fragility of Turkey\'s already-weak banking </p><p>sector -- problems the government would have to address. </p><p>Moreover, it coincided with AK criticisms of the BRSA, a </p><p>proposal by 20 AK MPs that Parliament investigate BRSA\'s </p><p>takeover of Pamukbank,  and senior-level AK meetings with </p><p>Mehmet Karamehmet, owner (through Cukurova Group) of </p><p>Pamukbank and of 45 percent of Yapi Kredi Bank.  As a result, </p><p>markets were voicing concern about the new government\'s </p><p>commitment to further bank reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Mercan, who is close to Prime Minister Gul, listened </p><p>carefully but evinced some skepticism about the legitimacy of </p><p>the Pamukbank takeover.  For example, he asked why BRSA did </p><p>not take over other weak banks, such as Isbank.  We responded </p><p>that he would hear mixed views from the markets on other </p><p>banks, but that there was a consensus in the financial </p><p>community that Karamehmet had managed Pamukbank into </p><p>insolvency and that the BRSA was right to take it over.  We </p><p>also noted strong support for the new government\'s pledge to </p><p>combat corruption, and suggested that cleaning up the banking </p><p>system was an integal part of that effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Mercan asked what we thought the government should </p><p>do.  We said that was up to the GOT to decide, but we thought </p><p>the markets would welcome -- as a first step -- a strong </p><p>public statement making clear that the government was </p><p>committed to further bank reform, would not bail out </p><p>poorly-managed banks, and fully supported an independent </p><p>BRSA.  The GOT would also need to consider steps to address </p><p>the short-term threat to the banking system posed by the </p><p>return of insolvent Pamukbank and nearly-insolvent Yapi Kredi </p><p>Bank to the Cukurova Group\'s control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: Key players in AK Party have met a number of </p><p>times with Karamehmet (Mercan said Party Chairman Erdogan had </p><p>met with him three times), but have not spoken with BRSA </p><p>officials.  They have bought Karamehmet\'s allegations that </p><p>BRSA\'s takeover of Pamukbank was politically-inspired and </p><p>unjust.  That belief is behind AK\'s sharp criticism\'s of BRSA </p><p>over the past few months, and probably explains the </p><p>government\'s weak response to last Friday\'s Danistay </p><p>decision.  Now that the financial community and the press -- </p><p>notably the Financial Times in its November 18 editorial -- </p><p>have begun to express concerns about the Danistay decision </p><p>and about AK\'s commitment to banking reform, we hope the </p><p>government will re-think its views.  One positive note: </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener (who oversees BRSA and </p><p>intially responded to the Danistay decision by telling BRSA </p><p>that it was "their problem") and State Minister Ali Babacan </p><p>have called BRSA President Engin Akcakoca in to brief them </p><p>for the first time. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
