CROCKER, REASON 1.5 (B/D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  SYRIAN PRESS JUNE 14-15 EMPHASIZED UNIFIED </p><p>SUPPORT FOR BASHAR AL-ASAD UNDER THE BANNER OF CONTINUING </p><p>HIS FATHER\'S LEGACY.  PRINT FEATURES INCLUDED FAVORABLE </p><p>COMMENTS BY THE SYRIAN JEWISH COMMUNITY AND FOREIGN </p><p>DELEGATIONS.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO COMMENTS </p><p>BY ARAB LEADERS, NOTABLY SAUDI CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH BIN </p><p>ABDUL AZIZ, INDICATING A DESIRE FOR AN EARLY ARAB STAMP OF </p><p>APPROVAL FOR HEIR APPARENT DR. BASHAR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>"LEAD US, O BASHAR, WE ARE ALL BEHIND YOU" </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) SYRIAN PRESS ON JUNE 14-15 WAS UNITED IN ITS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR BASHAR.  AN EDITORIAL IN THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED DAILY TISHRIN JUNE 14 EMPHASIZED THAT A "BIG </p><p>TRUST" WAS PLACED IN THE HANDS OF BASHAR, TO WHOM "WE </p><p>PLEDGED OUR ALLEGIANCE A LONG TIME AGO".  THE EDITORIAL </p><p>EMPASIZED BASHAR\'S DESIRE TO BOTH BUILD A MODERN SYRIA </p><p>CAPABLE OF PARTICIPATING IN THE "SCIENTIFIC AND </p><p>INFORMATION RENAISSANCE" AND TO CONTINUE THE "UNIQUE </p><p>STRUGGLE MARCH" FOR ARAB RIGHTS BEGUN BY HIS FATHER.  THE </p><p>PIECE CONCLUDED BY URGING THE HEIR APPARENT TO "LEAD US, O </p><p>BASHAR, WE ARE ALL BEHIND YOU".  A JUNE 15 EDITORIAL IN </p><p>THE SAME PUBLICATION SIMILARLY STRESSED THAT "THE </p><p>CONSENSUS OF THE SYRIANS ON THEIR PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO </p><p>GENERAL DR. BASHAR AL-ASAD AS PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY . </p><p>IS A CLEAR INDICATION OF THEIR ADHERENCE TO THE </p><p>CORRECTIONIST COURSE, THE COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION, </p><p>LIBERATION, STEADFASTNESS AND JOINT ARAB ACTION". </p><p> </p><p>THE LION AND THE CUB:  BASHAR AND HIS FATHER\'S LEGACY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY AL-BA\'TH REPORTED </p><p>ON JUNE 14 THAT THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WERE LOYAL ONLY TO THE </p><p>LATE, GREAT FIGHTER WHO "ACHIEVED MIRACLES IN A RECORD </p><p>RACE WITH TIME" (LATE PRESIDENT ASAD) AND TO THE "LION CUB </p><p>(BASHAR)" REARED UNDER HIS FATHER\'S TUTELAGE, WHO WILL </p><p>CARRY ON HIS LEGACY.  THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE SYRIA TIMES </p><p>ECHOED THE THEME OF CONTINUITY IN AN EDITORIAL THAT </p><p>PROCLAIMED THAT BASHAR AL-ASAD WILL "SUSTAIN HIS FATHER\'S </p><p>RICH LEGACY AND CONTINUE ENHANCING THE COUNTRY\'S MARCH OF </p><p>STEADFASTNESS AND ALL-OUT DEVELOPMENT UNTIL THE NATION\'S </p><p>RIGHTS AND LANDS ARE TOTALLY RETURNED, ITS DIGNITY AND </p><p>PRIDE ARE FULLY SAFEGUARDED AND A DECENT PLACE UNDER THE </p><p>SUN IS PRESERVED". </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY AL-BA\'TH REPORTED </p><p>THAT MEMBERS OF THE SYRIAN AL-MUSAWIYAH (JEWISH) COMMUNITY </p><p>HELD A SPECIAL SERVICE TO HONOR THE LATE PRESIDENT ASAD. </p><p>KHADR AL-KABARITI, WHO LED THE SERVICE, PRAISED THE LATE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S DECISION TO GRANT MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH </p><p>COMMUNITY EQUAL RIGHTS.  HE FURTHER STATED THAT THE JEWISH </p><p>COMMUNITY SUPPORTS THE NOMINATION OF BASHAR TO THE SYRIAN </p><p>PRESIDENCY AND EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT HE WOULD "BE A </p><p>GREAT LEADER, LIKE HIS FATHER, AND BE THE BEST SUCCESSOR </p><p>TO A GREAT LEADER". </p><p> </p><p>GRIEF AND OPTIMISM AMONG ARAB LEADERS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY TISHRIN STATED ON JUNE </p><p>14 THAT MILLIONS OF SYRIAN CITIZENS AND A VERY LARGE </p><p>NUMBER OF WORLD DELEGATIONS MOURNED THE LATE PRESIDENT, </p><p>AND THAT PEOPLE FROM ALL ARAB COUNTRIES TOOK PART IN THE </p><p>FUNERAL PROCESSION.  SIGNIFICANT COVERAGE WAS DEDICATED TO </p><p>THE STATEMENTS OF CONDOLENCE MADE BY VARIOUS FOREIGN </p><p>DELEGATIONS.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE </p><p>STATEMENT CABLED BY SAUDI CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH BIN ABD </p><p>AL-AZIZ TO BASHAR.  THE CABLE FEATURED PROMINENTLY IN </p><p>LOCAL ARABIC-LANGUAGE PRESS AND IN THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY SYRIA TIMES.  ABDALLAH </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS DEEP REGRET OVER THE TRAGIC LOSS OF LATE </p><p>PRESIDENT ASAD, BUT EMPHASIZED THAT HIS DELEGATION LEFT </p><p>SYRIA WITH "COMPLETE OPTIMISM AND CONFIDENCE THAT SYRIA </p><p>WILL BY THE WILL OF GOD BE IN SAFE AND SKILLFUL HANDS OF </p><p>ONE WHO HAS GROWN UP WITH FAITH IN GOD, PRIDE IN THE </p><p>NATION\'S HERITAGE, VALUES, SOLIDARITY IN RIGHT, DEPTH IN </p><p>THINKING, AND FAR-SIGHTEDNESS".  THE CROWN PRINCE FURTHER </p><p>STRESSED SAUDI ARABIA\'S FULL SUPPORT FOR SYRIA IN ALL </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES AS AN ISLAMIC AND MORAL DUTY.  HE CONCLUDED </p><p>BY EXTENDING BEST WISHES TO BASHAR IN LEADING THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED SYRIAN PRESS HAS </p><p>COME DOWN SQUARELY BEHIND BASHAR, STRESSING THE THEME OF </p><p>CONTINUITY AND PERPETUATION OF HIS FATHER\'S LEGACY.  WHILE </p><p>SYRIAN MEDIA HAS ACCORDED FULL ATTENTION TO PRESIDENT </p><p>ASAD\'S PASSING, IT HAS BEEN CAREFUL TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE </p><p>COUNTRY NOW STANDS UNITED BEHIND THE HEIR APPARENT.  THE </p><p>PROMINENT COVERAGE OF THE COMMENTS OF FOREIGN DELEGATES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THOSE OF SAUDI CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH, SUGGEST </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE THE NEW REGIME ACCORDS TO AN EARLY ARAB </p><p>STAMP OF APPROVAL FOR BASHAR. </p><p> </p><p>CROCKER </p><p></p></div>
