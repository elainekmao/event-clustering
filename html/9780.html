<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004804 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: PARLIAMENT TAKES UP CONTROVERSIAL NSC </p><p>REFORM </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4544 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Parliament July 30 -- two days before the </p><p>legislative recess -- began debating the AK Government\'s 7th </p><p>EU reform-related package, which deals with in part </p><p>controversial changes to the powerful National Security </p><p>Council and the NSC Secretariat.  The package may be voted </p><p>late July 30.  Most observers expect the package to pass </p><p>muster, but we caution that it is not yet in the bag.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The most notable NSC-related features of the </p><p>34-article package include the following provisions: 1) the </p><p>NSC SecGen will be assigned by the prime minister with the </p><p>approval of the president; 2) the NSC shall meet every two </p><p>months, or at the discretion of the prime minister or </p><p>president; 3) making the NSC agenda and procedures/guidelines </p><p>presumably less peremptory by removing the second sentence of </p><p>Turkish constitution Art. 118 para. 3, which currently </p><p>requires the cabinet to "evaluate decisions of the NSC </p><p>concerning the measures it deems necessary for the </p><p>preservation of the existence and independence of the State, </p><p>the integrity and indivisibility of the country, and the </p><p>peace and security of society." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) July 30 press coverage highlights a "harsh" de facto </p><p>open letter from current (and outgoing) NSC SecGen Gen. </p><p>Tuncer Kilinc, a noted hard-liner, to President Sezer and </p><p>P.M. Erdogan claiming that the AK Government\'s plan to </p><p>"civilianize" the NSC bureaucracy will "politicize" the </p><p>national security policy formation process.  "You will make </p><p>the NSC dysfunctional" and undermine national security, </p><p>Kilinc charged.  The General also dismissed the notion of </p><p>appointing a civilian to the head the NSC General </p><p>Secretariat, even a senior ambassador; he pointedly suggested </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>that Erdogan might as well assign a mid-level interior </p><p>ministry bureaucrat (kaymakam) to the post.  Kilinc also </p><p>reportedly emphasized the necessity of protecting the current </p><p>(military-dominated) NSC structure.  Related reporting ties </p><p>the letter to the upcoming meeting of the Supreme Military </p><p>Council (YAS), at which Kilinc and others will presumably be </p><p>retired. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Parliamentary Views </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Moments before heading to the floor for the debate, AK </p><p>Yozgat M.P. Mehmet Erdemir told us that he is uncertain as to </p><p>how the vote actually will go.  He said that AK "is under </p><p>major pressure" from unspecified quarters.  On July 29, AK </p><p>Erzurum M.P. Ibrahim Ozdogan offered to us privately that the </p><p>reform package represents a positive development in </p><p>redressing the civilian-military imbalance -- "you have to </p><p>start somewhere," he said -- while emphasizing that the value </p><p>of the package would be largely symbolic.  Indeed, he </p><p>asserted that by itself the reforms will do little to change </p><p>the situation; he noted in particular that AK\'s plan to bring </p><p>the military budget under civilian control has been </p><p>essentially hamstrung by confining investigations to secret </p><p>deliberations by the unelected Court of Accounts (Sayistay) </p><p>rather than to direct, and more open, parliamentary </p><p>oversight. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In a separate private meeting with us July 30, </p><p>opposition CHP M.P. Halil Akyuz (Istanbul -- a member of the </p><p>Foreign Affairs Committee) said his party will support the </p><p>package as currently configured.  CHP\'s primary objection, he </p><p>said, is that AK continues to bring packages to the floor, </p><p>thereby putting CHP in the politically awkward position of </p><p>having to declare itself on AK\'s side repeatedly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Selcuk\'s Legal/Political Analysis </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) On July 29, Sami Selcuk, former President of the High </p><p>Court of Appeals and a leading reformist voice, expressed to </p><p>us sentiments similar to Ozdogan\'s: while sounding a positive </p><p>note, he cautioned against expecting immediate, comprehensive </p><p>change in civilian-military relations as a result of the </p><p>current package.  Selcuk linked the reform issue and the YAS </p><p>meeting, noting that the YAS presented a major opportunity </p><p>for Turkey -- if TGS Chief Ozkok, whom he described as more </p><p>democratically-inclined than most of the other senior </p><p>commanders, could succeed in putting a new stamp on the </p><p>military leadership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The package on the floor has been somewhat diluted </p><p>(reftel), which presumably would make it less controversial </p><p>and easier to pass through Parliament.  However, Erdemir\'s </p><p>cautionary note is worth keeping in mind -- as is the fact </p><p>that Kilinc\'s letter reportedly went not only to Erdogan but </p><p>to a president: 1) interested in maintaining Establishment </p><p>equities; and 2) habituated to blocking AK legislative and </p><p>other changes. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
