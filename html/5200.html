<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES/PCI, WHA/CAN (RUNNING) </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, OFFICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (STEIGER) </p><p> </p><p>CDC FOR EPIDEMIOLOGY PROGRAM OFFICE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, SENV, CA, Health </p><p>SUBJECT: WEST NILE VIRUS: ONTARIO DOCTORS MUST REPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Ontario is expected to make it mandatory soon to </p><p>report human cases of West Nile Virus to the provincial </p><p>Public Health Officer. "Reportable diseases" are listed </p><p>in regulations made under the statutory authority of </p><p>the province\'s Health Protection and Promotion Act. </p><p>This will make Ontario the first jurisdiction in Canada </p><p>to have such a mandatory reporting requirement for West </p><p>Nile Virus. According to Ontario health officials, of </p><p>the States adjacent to, or adjoining Ontario; i.e., New </p><p>York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan - currently only </p><p>New York has specific mandatory reporting requirements </p><p>for human incidents of West Nile infection. </p><p> </p><p>2. Reporting by physicians to their local Public Health </p><p>Board is mandated by provincial legislation or </p><p>regulation, rather than by federal law. As a </p><p>consequence the list of diseases that are reportable </p><p>can vary slightly from province to province. </p><p> </p><p>3. We anticipate that Quebec is the only province </p><p>likely to follow Ontario\'s lead in making WNV a </p><p>"reportable" disease before the 2003 Mosquito season </p><p>arrives. According to Health Canada figures, in 2002 </p><p>the two provinces with the highest incidence of West </p><p>Nile Virus infection in humans were Ontario (with 76 </p><p>confirmed cases) and Quebec (with only 7 confirmed </p><p>cases). In each province one death was confirmed due to </p><p>West Nile Virus in 2002.  The third highest incidence </p><p>of human West Nile Virus infection was noted in the </p><p>province of Alberta with one case - and authorities </p><p>there have concluded that this individual likely </p><p>acquired the infection outside of Alberta. </p><p> </p><p>4. Ontario\'s chief public health official, Dr. Colin </p><p>D\'Cunha noted that a significant concern that has </p><p>driven the province to make WNV reportable is the fact </p><p>that WNV is transmissible via donated blood.  As well, </p><p>D\'Cunha said that knowledge of how many people in a </p><p>particular community are showing symptoms of WNV would </p><p>aid decision-makers when they consider measures, such </p><p>as spraying insecticide, to reduce the mosquito </p><p>population. </p><p> </p><p>5. The Canadian federal list of reportable/notifiable </p><p>diseases does not currently include West Nile Virus, </p><p>although the federal government does collect data from </p><p>the provinces. Indeed, in Canada reporting by the </p><p>provinces of reportable diseases (also referred to as </p><p>notifiable diseases) to the Federal Government\'s Centre </p><p>for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control is </p><p>voluntary. A consensus of federal and provincial health </p><p>officials\' opinion sets the list and as noted in </p><p>paragraph 2, provincial authorities make the necessary </p><p>change to their laws and regulations to mandate </p><p>physician reporting to provincial authorities. Although </p><p>there is currently no statutory authority at the </p><p>federal level to make disease reporting by physicians </p><p>mandatory to federal authorities, Health Canada </p><p>officials told us that legislation is being drafted </p><p>that would have this effect. Post will monitor </p><p>developments. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
