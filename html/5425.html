The Government of Nepal (GON) and the Maoists announced </p><p>a ceasefire on January 29 (Ref A).  The international </p><p>community widely welcomed the news of a ceasefire.  The </p><p>Maoist-aligned All Nepal National Independent Students Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) said that it will go ahead with </p><p>their planned education strike despite the ceasefire.  Prior </p><p>to the ceasefire announcement, the week got off to a brutal </p><p>start after Maoists gunned down Krishna Mohan Shrestha, </p><p>Inspector General of Police, his wife and a sub-inspector, </p><p>causing fear and outrage throughout Nepal (Ref B).  Maoists </p><p>also killed seventeen security personnel, including six </p><p>police and six Armed Police Force (APF) personnel.  Two </p><p>civilians were killed in the same attack.  Maoists abducted </p><p>thirty-six students from a secondary school, and thirty-six </p><p>villagers.  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) is planning to </p><p>increase its troop strength to help combat the insurgency. </p><p>In an effort to correct human rights violations, the </p><p>Government of Nepal announced plans to compensate the </p><p>families of those killed by errant security forces.  The </p><p>army also announced court-martials for those found guilty of </p><p>killing innocent civilians (Ref C).  Amnesty International </p><p>expressed concern again over the human rights situation in </p><p>Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>CEASE-FIRE ANNOUNCED; LEADERS CAUTIOUS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Government of Nepal (GON) and the Maoists declared a </p><p>ceasefire on January 29.  The GON agreed to remove the </p><p>terrorist label, withdraw red corner notices from Interpol </p><p>and remove rewards for intelligence on top Maoist leaders </p><p>(Ref A).  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister For Physical Planning </p><p>and Works, was designated by the government as its peace </p><p>talks coordinator. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The United States and the international community </p><p>welcomed the news of the ceasefire.  England, Germany, </p><p>Finland, India and the EU Heads of Mission all expressed </p><p>support for the ceasefire and hope that it would lead to a </p><p>peaceful resolution. </p><p> </p><p>4.  GON officials remain cautious. Ramesh Nath Pandey, </p><p>Minister for Information and Communication, was quoted in </p><p>local papers as saying that "peace talks will begin soon," </p><p>but Narayan Singh Pun, Minister for Physical Planning and </p><p>Works, cautioned that the hard part was just beginning.  Pun </p><p>said there was no definite time frame for when the peace </p><p>talks would begin, and that it was a delicate process that </p><p>should be taken one step at a time. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Dadhi Raj Lamichhane, one of the Maoist mediators, said </p><p>the Maoists were committed to the ceasefire and told local </p><p>reporters that if anyone from either side violated the </p><p>ceasefire they should be branded as "traitors." </p><p> </p><p>EDUCATION STRIKE TO GO ON </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The All Nepal National Independent Students Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist-aligned students </p><p>organization, said it will not cancel its plans for the </p><p>upcoming educational strike.  ANNISU-R threatened to close </p><p>all educational institutions, indefinitely, beginning </p><p>February 13 if the GON does not meet its 13-point demands, </p><p>which include free education and an increase in school </p><p>budgets. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ANNISU-R issued a statement on January 30 that if the </p><p>GON did not sit down for talks, it would turn schools </p><p>throughout the country into "focal points of agitation." </p><p>ANNISU-R said it would go ahead with the strike despite the </p><p>ceasefire declared by the Maoist leadership. </p><p> </p><p>BRUTAL MURDER OF INSPECTOR GENERAL </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Krishna Mohan Shrestha, Inspector General of the Armed </p><p>Police Force, his wife and bodyguard were gunned down while </p><p>walking outside their home on the morning of January 26 (Ref </p><p>B).  Shrestha is the highest-ranking security official to be </p><p>killed since the start of the Maoist insurgency.  The </p><p>Government of Nepal condemned the murders, calling them </p><p>disgraceful and cowardly and asserting that they showed the </p><p>true face of the terrorists to the world.  Prime Minister </p><p>Lokendra Bahadur Chand said the murders would not deter </p><p>security forces in their fight against the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL ATTACKS NEPAL AGAIN </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Amnesty International (AI) issued a statement on January </p><p>24 expressing serious concern about the worsening human </p><p>rights situation in Nepal.  The statement comes on the heels </p><p>of a report that security personnel rearrested Janak Prasad </p><p>Adhikari, a suspected Maoist, soon after the Supreme Court </p><p>ordered his release (Ref C). AI declared that not enough was </p><p>being done to stop human rights violations. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Government of Nepal said it would compensate the </p><p>families of two boys killed by security forces in Myagdi </p><p>District in December.  The two boys, age 14 and 23, were </p><p>killed while returning home after taking their grandfather </p><p>for treatment for rheumatism.  According to press reports, </p><p>security forces insisted the boys were killed </p><p>unintentionally as a result of a crossfire.  The GON said </p><p>each family would receive just over 1200 dollars. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Madan Prasad Aryal, Defense Secretary, was quoted in </p><p>the local press as declaring that the army is committed to </p><p>honoring human rights and will punish those who are found </p><p>guilty of violations.  Aryal, speaking at a local </p><p>conference, said that the army personnel implicated in the </p><p>killing of five innocent youths in Nuwakot District in </p><p>November are being court-martialed (Ref C).  Aryal, however, </p><p>denied that any army officers were involved in the alleged </p><p>rape of two girls in Napalgunj District, declaring, "No case </p><p>of rape took place inside the barracks." </p><p> </p><p>PEOPLES WAR TAKING TOLL ON SECURITY FORCES </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  According to an internal report, figures released on </p><p>January 25 by the Terrorism Control Section of the Police </p><p>Headquarters show that Maoists have killed 985 police </p><p>officers, injured almost 1400 others, and abducted almost </p><p>300 officers.  In addition, Maoists have destroyed countless </p><p>police posts and stolen 800,000 dollars in cash and goods </p><p>from the police.  According to the local press, an unnamed </p><p>high-ranking officer was quoted saying that officers fear </p><p>for their lives in Maoist-infested areas and that the police </p><p>force is suffering physically and psychologically because of </p><p>the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The Royal Nepal Army had also suffered losses due to </p><p>the insurgency.  Madan Kumar Aryal, Defence Secretary, said </p><p>that 244 soldiers had been killed and 363 had been injured </p><p>since the start of the Maoist "Peoples War." </p><p> </p><p>INSURGENTS CONTINUE ATTACKS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  Heavy fighting between security forces and Maoists </p><p>along the border of Baglung and Pyuthan Districts claimed </p><p>the lives of five policemen.  The policemen had been missing </p><p>since the clash began on January 27.  Their bodies were </p><p>discovered several days later.  The battle continued even as </p><p>the announcement of a ceasefire was made on January 29. </p><p>Maoists, aiming at an Army helicopter in Surkhet District, </p><p>shot and killed two civilians, including a young girl, on </p><p>January 27.  The civilians were part of a mass meeting </p><p>organized by the Maoists, who demanded that each household </p><p>in the district send at least one person to the meeting. </p><p>Maoists killed a retired policeman on January 26 in Bara </p><p>District.  He was taken from his home, tied up and then </p><p>shot.  The Maoists killed a police officer in Ilam District </p><p>on January 23, after dragging him from his house and </p><p>slitting his throat.  The officer had gone home on leave to </p><p>visit his ill father.  On January 24 a landmine blast, </p><p>planted by Maoists, exploded in Surkhet District, killing </p><p>five Armed Police Force (APF) personnel and injuring </p><p>seventeen others.  In Dang District, another member of the </p><p>APF was also killed in a landmine blast.  He was part of a </p><p>team of security personnel assigned to guard a </p><p>communications tower. Five security personnel were killed </p><p>and 31 injured in Nepalgunj District after an ambush by </p><p>Maoists on January 24. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS STILL ABDUCTING STUDENTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  Maoists stormed into a classroom in Palpa District and </p><p>abducted 36 students from a secondary school.  Their </p><p>whereabouts are still unknown.  Meanwhile, the students </p><p>abducted from northwestern Rolpa District, taken on January </p><p>23, remain captive.  Maoists reportedly took the children as </p><p>part of a Maoist training program in which the students are </p><p>forced to do road construction and farm work. </p><p> </p><p>16.  According to the local press, a group of armed Maoists </p><p>abducted 36 villagers in the middle of the day from Dang </p><p>District, ordering them to go with the Maoists to fight. </p><p>Four managed to escape, and fled to India. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Maoists abducted a civilian from Dang District on </p><p>January 24, accusing him of being an informant.  He has not </p><p>been released.  A Royal Nepal Army (RNA) soldier, taken by </p><p>the Maoists while guarding the Khimti Hydro-Power Project </p><p>(Ref D), sent a letter appealing for his life.  The </p><p>insurgents allowed the soldier to send a letter to local </p><p>human rights activists, in which he begged for help to be </p><p>returned home safely. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Maoists in Kailali District are forcing families of </p><p>security personnel to vacate their houses, after which they </p><p>are locked.  The families are also prevented from leaving </p><p>the village, leaving them with nowhere to live but unable to </p><p>get out of the district. According to local press reports, </p><p>the Maoists have locked up approximately 200 houses, forcing </p><p>the families to set up tents in their yards or take refuge </p><p>with neighbors. </p><p> </p><p>PLANS TO BEEF UP SECURITY </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  Madan Kumar Aryal, Defense Secretary, told the local </p><p>press that the Government of Nepal (GON) is planning to </p><p>increase the number of personnel in the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>(RNA) from 60,000 to 66,000 in an effort to strengthen the </p><p>force in its fight against the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>20.  In a separate report, the local press said that armed </p><p>security forces were to be stationed along the Nepal-India </p><p>border following reports that the Maoists are using the area </p><p>to smuggle in contraband, including weapons.  The security </p><p>force had been removed from the Koilabus post, which is only </p><p>34 kilometers from the Maoists\' Dang District training </p><p>center, after the Maoists attacked it in December. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
