An estimated 7,000 Iranian refugees live in Iraq, mostly </p><p>in settlements from Al Amarah to Al Kut. Life for them has </p><p>become more precarious with the defeat of the former regime. </p><p>When most arrived in Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war 23 years </p><p>ago, the regime rewarded refugees with parcels of land. </p><p>However, in the last month, some refugees complain they have </p><p>been forcibly evicted from their homes in the south, with </p><p>their houses burned, crops destroyed and land seized by </p><p>local Iraqis.  Other Iranian refugees have left their homes </p><p>to travel back to Iran, only to find the border posts </p><p>closed, and little or no water or food available.  UNHCR is </p><p>aware of the situation and has met with Iranian refugee </p><p>representatives to try to resolve the problems and to </p><p>restart the repatriation of the Iranian refugees.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The largest number of Iranian refugees in Iraq reside in </p><p>the town of Dujaila, south of Al Kut.  Of a population of </p><p>12,000 in Dujaila, 5,000 are Iranian refugees.  The United </p><p>Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) met recently </p><p>with refugee representatives in the town.  One UNHCR </p><p>official described the situation as "explosive" and said it </p><p>could lead to armed conflict between groups of local Iraqis </p><p>and Iranian refugees, both of which have weapons.  Some </p><p>refugees complain they have been ordered out of their homes </p><p>by Iraqis, with their homes and crops destroyed and land </p><p>taken.  UNHCR said even the four Iraqi tribal leaders with </p><p>whom they met in Dujaila stated that it was "time for the </p><p>Iranians to leave behind their lands and to return to Iran." </p><p>Some refugees complained that local Iraqis told them they </p><p>were living on the Iraqis\' land and to return to Iran. </p><p>Others said they heard an Iranian radio broadcast, telling </p><p>them to go to the border because they would be allowed to </p><p>cross into Iran.  Some refugee families refuse to leave </p><p>because they do not want to abandon or be forced to sell off </p><p>their livestock. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Responding to these push factors, an estimated 500 </p><p>refugees left their homes in Al Kumayt and the River Sa\'ad </p><p>areas.  The refugees traveled to the Makhfar Sharhani border </p><p>crossing between Iraq and Iran, and this group is camped at </p><p>the Iraqi border post in the middle of a desert, about 100 </p><p>kilometers northeast of Al Amarah. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>DART ASSESSMENT OF REFUGEE CAMP </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART and the International Medical Corps, escorted </p><p>by two Coalition vehicles, traveled to the refugee </p><p>encampment on 10 May for a rapid assessment of the water and </p><p>food needs of those living at the border crossing point. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The road to the border narrows from a two-lane, </p><p>blacktopped road to a one-lane, partially paved road, </p><p>scarred by the 1980 Iraq-Iran war, explosions of landmines, </p><p>and years of neglect.  At the approach to the border post, </p><p>signs posted along both sides of the road read in Arabic: </p><p>"Ihzar:  Haql Algham," or "Watch out: Minefield."  Burned </p><p>Iraqi tanks and trucks dot the barren landscape that </p><p>parallels the highway northeast to the border. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Iraqi border post consists of a few buildings, </p><p>including one that resembles a miniature castle with four </p><p>towers, long ago abandoned for use by immigration and </p><p>customs officials.  The tribal leader of the refugees, or </p><p>sheikh, says life at the border post is "harder than the </p><p>life of an animal.  At least, animals are provided with </p><p>shelter."   Temperatures already reach into the upper 90s </p><p>(Fahrenheit) during the day, and will get hotter as summer </p><p>begins. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The refugees are camped out mostly in the open, a few of </p><p>them using large tents for housing, including the sheikh and </p><p>his extended family, but most have erecting shacks of </p><p>corrugated metal sheets, supported by wooden slats and </p><p>covered with blankets or strips of fabric. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Although the sheikh says 104 families or about 750 </p><p>Iranian refugees have been living at the border for a month, </p><p>the DART estimated the refugee population at about half that </p><p>number.  The sheikh said he expects more families to follow </p><p>them to the border post once it is confirmed they can cross </p><p>into Iran. </p><p> </p><p>9.  There is no running water or electricity at the </p><p>settlement.  Refugee women fill a 20-liter jerrycan or </p><p>bucket with drinking water from a tanker provided by the </p><p>Iranian Red Crescent Society, one kilometer east of the </p><p>settlement at the border and walk back to the camp, carrying </p><p>the containers on their heads.  The sheikh told the DART the </p><p>group receives daily visits by the water tanker.   Refugees </p><p>International personnel, in a later visit to the refugee </p><p>encampment, were told the tanker visits are infrequent.  The </p><p>refugees told the DART the water is clear and clean, </p><p>although it has not been tested for impurities or bacteria. </p><p>Many parents complained that their children suffer from </p><p>diarrhea.   According to the refugee leader, one baby died </p><p>of pneumonia.  Another child died after being bitten by a </p><p>poisonous snake.  Several refugee families had limited </p><p>amounts of antibiotics including amoxicillin. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>IRANIAN RED CRESCENT SOCIETY ASSISTANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) sends a doctor </p><p>to the camp every four to five days. An estimated 15 women </p><p>are pregnant.   One pregnant woman, due to give birth in a </p><p>few days, according to her medical paperwork, said she has </p><p>yet to see a doctor at the camp because all the visiting </p><p>doctors have been men. </p><p> </p><p>11.  IRCS also provides a small amount of food to the </p><p>refugees.  The amount and variety of food varies but may </p><p>include bread, canned meat or fish, peas, tea, biscuits, and </p><p>occasionally, dates.  The refugees say British troops who </p><p>visited the camp a few weeks ago brought with them nine bags </p><p>of rice, some tea and tins of pork for the refugees (but </p><p>quickly withdrew the pork when they realized their mistake </p><p>of offering it to Muslims).  Some refugee families have </p><p>livestock including chickens, sheep, and cows. </p><p> </p><p>12.  There are no latrines at the camp, and the refugees </p><p>relieve themselves anywhere in the settlement, which is </p><p>surrounded by unexploded ordnance and mines.  According to </p><p>the sheikh, one child threw a rock into the dirt recently, </p><p>and it hit a landmine, causing it to explode.  A shepherd </p><p>also passed through the camp with his herd, triggering </p><p>another landmine explosion, which killed four sheep. </p><p>Fortunately, no one has been hurt in the camp from UXO or </p><p>landmine explosions. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>UNHCR ASSISTANCE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  UNHCR representatives in Basrah said they plan to </p><p>travel to the border encampment by the end of the week to </p><p>assess how to help the refugees.  One UNHCR official said </p><p>his approach would be two-fold:  1) for UNHCR to pressure </p><p>Iran to restart the refugee repatriation program and 2) to </p><p>persuade the refugees to leave the border regions for safer </p><p>encampments until UNHCR can help them return to Iran in a </p><p>safe and orderly manner. </p><p> </p><p>14.  UNHCR plans to send additional humanitarian assistance </p><p>to Dujaila this week to help defuse tensions between Iranian </p><p>refugees and Iraqi residents.  UNHCR, in conjunction with </p><p>the World Health Organization (WHO), plans to send a WHO </p><p>health kit to provide medications to the 5,000 Iranian </p><p>refugees as well as the Iraqi residents in town.  A second </p><p>WHO health kit has been requested and UNHCR will determine </p><p>later where to send it.  UNHCR has also hired an Iraqi </p><p>contractor to provide eight 15,000-liter water tankers to </p><p>Dujaila; four of them to supply the refugees with drinking </p><p>water and the other four for the Iraqis.  UNHCR has also </p><p>contacted the World Food Program about providing additional </p><p>food stocks to benefit all 12,000 residents of Dujaila. </p><p> </p><p>15.  A smaller group of 60 Iranian refugees left their homes </p><p>around Al Kut and traveled to a UNHCR transit center, 20 </p><p>kilometers east of Basrah.  The center was badly looted </p><p>during the war and has no amenities.  UNHCR officials have </p><p>visited the refugees there, and strongly urged them to </p><p>return to their homes or to go to safer areas away from the </p><p>border.  It is not known how many may have left the border </p><p>transit center. </p><p> </p><p>16.  UNHCR says it successfully assisted in the repatriation </p><p>of 1,050 Iranian refugees from Iraq until the Iraqi </p><p>government suspended the program shortly before the war </p><p>began March 20.  Since then, Iran has been reluctant to </p><p>restart the program because of apparent fears that Iraqis </p><p>may `infiltrate\' the refugees. </p><p> </p><p>17.  UNHCR says it is hesitant to provide assistance to the </p><p>refugees camped at the border because the border post north </p><p>of Al Amarah and the transit center east of Basrah do not </p><p>have any facilities, and are in heavily-mined areas.  UNHCR </p><p>fears additional assistance might attract other Iranian </p><p>refugee families to move to the border encampments. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  The situation of the Iranian refugees in Iraq, in the </p><p>long-term, is more a problem requiring a political than a </p><p>humanitarian solution.  It is suggested that UNHCR-Geneva </p><p>should continue negotiations with Iran to restart the </p><p>repatriation of Iranian refugees from Iraq.  In the short </p><p>term, if UNHCR is unable to persuade the Iranian refugees to </p><p>leave their temporary encampments for safer areas away from </p><p>the border, UNHCR will need to develop a plan to provide </p><p>assistance to the refugee groups without prompting more </p><p>refugees to migrate to the encampments. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
