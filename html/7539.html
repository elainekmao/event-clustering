<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000813 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED--PLEASE HANDLE </p><p>ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, PREL, SOCI, KDEM, ASEC, CASC, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SOUTHWEST POLITICS UPENDED AS </p><p>POLL DEADLINE APPROACHES </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY.  The April 19 gubernatorial and </p><p>presidential election will be a remarkable test of </p><p>incumbent power-players and ethnic politics in the </p><p>Southwest.  After stunning defeats in the National </p><p>Assembly elections on April 12, the Alliance for </p><p>Democracy (AD) is fighting for its political life. </p><p>Free and fair or not, the public will judge the </p><p>relative strength of candidates and entrenched </p><p>interest groups from the outcome.  Although the AD </p><p>is encouraging its supporters to cast a protest </p><p>vote against Obasanjo, such action is unlikely to </p><p>deny Obasanjo victory in the southwestern states. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEKEND? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In the Southwest, the April 19 poll will </p><p>especially test the strength and relevance of </p><p>Afenifere, the most prominent Yoruba socio- </p><p>cultural interest group.  Afenifere leadership has </p><p>long served as a rallying point for Yorubas. </p><p>Following the April 12 National Assembly election, </p><p>Afenifere met with the six Southwest governors, </p><p>all of whom belong to the AD, to review the </p><p>results.  In that election, the AD lost nearly all </p><p>of its National Assembly seats to the national </p><p>ruling party, the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP). </p><p>Apart from AD\'s success in Lagos State, last </p><p>weekend\'s polls marked the first time since </p><p>Nigeria\'s independence that a mainstream Yoruba </p><p>political party has fallen in the Southwest. </p><p>Unable to fathom a tenable reason for this poor </p><p>showing, the Afenifere-AD leadership concluded </p><p>their failure was the PDP\'s handiwork.  They </p><p>alleged that the PDP manipulated the electoral </p><p>process and intimidated their supporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>WHAT\'S NEXT?  WHAT DOES IT MEAN? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Top Afenifere and AD leaders, led by </p><p>Senator Abraham Adesanya, met on April 14 with </p><p>President Obasanjo to protest "massive rigging" of </p><p>the National Assembly election.  They demanded </p><p>that the President address the matter quickly or </p><p>risk losing the Southwest\'s support.  The group </p><p>warned it would not hesitate to direct its </p><p>supporters--i.e. the extended Yoruba nation--to </p><p>cast protest votes against Obasanjo and vote </p><p>instead for the AD.  NOTE:  As the AD did not </p><p>field a presidential candidate of its own, under </p><p>election rules, such ballots should not count as </p><p>valid votes but should be reflected in the </p><p>"rejected votes" total.  The damage to Obasanjo </p><p>would be that the votes he expected from the </p><p>Southwest would be reduced, forcing him to make up </p><p>his count elsewhere.  If, however, the AD </p><p>persuades voters to cast their lot with another </p><p>candidate, especially Buhari, Obasanjo could face </p><p>a much stiffer contest in the Southwest that would </p><p>also make the nationwide vote count more </p><p>competitive.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Afenifere\'s threat raises significant </p><p>questions about its power in Southwest politics. </p><p>Do Afenifere leaders really control the Southwest, </p><p>as they often claim?  If last week\'s National </p><p>Assembly election was not rigged as they claim, </p><p>did it reflect a new Southwestern political </p><p>reality?  If so, what is this new reality?  Did </p><p>the Southwestern electorate throw its weight </p><p>behind the PDP to signify solidarity with </p><p>incumbent President Obasanjo, whom they failed to </p><p>support in 1999?  Or, as international observers </p><p>witnessed in some areas, were Yoruba voters </p><p>confused about how and for whom to vote in last </p><p>week\'s National Assembly election as opposed to </p><p>this week\'s presidential election? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Afenifere and AD will not give up </p><p>without a fight.  They may do everything in this </p><p>week\'s election that they accuse the PDP of having </p><p>done last weekend--rigging, thuggery, bribery, </p><p>manipulation--to counter a repeat attack by such </p><p>means.  Senator Adesanya has already warned that </p><p>the AD will forcefully resist any attempt to rig </p><p>the coming election.  The Southwestern governors </p><p>have all spoken along the same lines.  AD leaders </p><p>may also engage in legal actions.  Such desperate </p><p>measures might yield results favorable to AD in </p><p>Lagos and Oyo states, but may not make a </p><p>meaningful impact in Ondo, Ekiti, Osun, or Ogun </p><p>states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) COMMENT.  This Saturday\'s election could </p><p>provide convincing proof of the true state of </p><p>affairs in the Southwest.  We believe the most </p><p>likely scenario is that Afenifere leaders have </p><p>lost much of their former control.  But, if </p><p>governors in such states as Ogun, Ekiti, and Osun, </p><p>where the AD lost nearly everything last week are </p><p>returned to power this weekend, then Afenifere is </p><p>right and truly in charge.  If the Obasanjo-PDP </p><p>performance on April 19 drops from their </p><p>impressive showing on April 12, then something </p><p>really went wrong for the AD last weekend, and </p><p>their accusations of rigging carry more weight. </p><p>The Southwest should be where the action is this </p><p>election round.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
