IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: ON MARCH 9, ACTING PRINCIPAL DEPUTY </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY MARK BELLAMY HELD DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ON THE STATE OF ZIMBABWE\'S POLITICAL CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AND WHAT CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE THE U.S. COULD PLAY, IF ANY, </p><p>TO HELP RESOLVE THE SITUATION.  THE MDC LEADERSHIP </p><p>CALLED FOR AN EMINENT PERSON TO CONVINCE MUGABE TO ALTER </p><p>HIS BEHAVIOR AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING </p><p>FOREIGN ELECTION MONITORS IN ADVANCE OF THE EARLY 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL POLL.  THE MDC\'S MEETING WITH THE RULING </p><p>ANC OF SOUTH AFRICA, ZANU-PF\'S INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN, </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DYNAMICS WERE ALSO DISCUSSED.  ON </p><p>MARCH 8, BELLAMY MET WITH MDC MP DAVID COLTART, WHO </p><p>ARGUED THAT MOST OF THE POLITICAL KILLINGS AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION CAN BE TIED DIRECTLY TO 10 OR 12 ZANU-PF </p><p>LEADERS.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD CONDEMN THE </p><p>CULTURE OF IMPUNITY THAT PERMEATES THE COUNTRY AND HOLD </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE THOSE LEADERS WHO BENEFIT FROM IT.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON MARCH 9, ACTING PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY MARK BELLAMY, ACCOMPANIED BY CHARGE AND POLOFF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(NOTETAKER) MET MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI FOR AN HOUR-LONG BREAKFAST </p><p>MEETING AT THE CHARGE\'S RESIDENCE.  TSVANGIRAI WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00969  01 OF 02  091557Z </p><p>MDC DIRECTOR OF ELECTIONS AND GWANDA NORTH MP PAUL </p><p>NYATHI.  THE DISCUSSION WAS VERY OPEN AND CORDIAL. </p><p> </p><p>ANC NOT ENCOURAGING </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NCUBE ELUCIDATED ON THE MDC\'S RECENT TALKS WITH </p><p>THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (ANC) IN SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>ALL THE MDC LEADERS PRESENT SEEMED DISMAYED WITH THE </p><p>ANC\'S POSITION AT THESE MEETINGS.  NCUBE REPORTED THAT </p><p>THE ANC\'S MAIN MESSAGE TO THE MDC WAS THAT IT SHOULD </p><p>ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE WITH THE RULING ZIMBABWE AFRICAN </p><p>NATIONAL UNION-PATRIOTIC FRONT (ZANU-PF), AND THAT IT </p><p>COULD NEGOTIATE A RETURN TO THE RULE OF LAW WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE.  TSVANGIRAI REMARKED </p><p>RHETORICALLY "WHY SHOULD WE NEGOTIATE SOMETHING THAT THE </p><p>GOZ SHOULD BE DOING ALREADY?"  HE ADDED THAT THE ANC </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT, IF THE MDC AND GOZ WERE SEEN NEGOTIATING </p><p>A RETURN TO NORMALCY, SOUTH AFRICA COULD THEN PUSH THE </p><p>IFIS AND INTERNATIONAL DONORS TO RESUME LENDING AND AID </p><p>PROGRAMS.  BELLAMY SAID THE ANC POSITION WAS </p><p>INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND UNHELPFUL.  NCUBE BELIEVED THE ANC </p><p>TOOK THIS POSITION BECAUSE IT WANTS TO GET OFF THE HOT </p><p>SEAT SO IT CAN TELL THE WORLD THAT ZIMBABWEANS ARE </p><p>WORKING OUT THEIR OWN PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF VIOLENCE CONTINUES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE MDC LEADERS WENT ON TO DESCRIBE ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>LATEST INTIMIDATION TACTICS.  NCUBE REPORTED THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00969  01 OF 02  091557Z </p><p>PARTY HAS SET UP WAR VETERAN CAMPS THROUGHOUT </p><p>MASHONALAND CENTRAL AND EAST PROVINCES, AND THAT THESE </p><p>WAR VETERANS AND YOUTHS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAVE </p><p>EMBARKED ON A CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AND TERROR.  LOCAL </p><p>MDC LEADERS AND YOUTH ARE BEING SINGLED OUT FOR SEVERE </p><p>BEATINGS, NCUBE CLAIMED.  GURUVE AND SHAMVA DISTRICTS </p><p>HAVE BECOME "NO-GO" AREAS FOR THE MDC.  MANY LOCAL MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS, NOT JUST IN MASHONALAND, ARE NOT ORGANIZING </p><p>FOR THE PARTY OUT OF FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY.  MANY WILL </p><p>NOT EVEN SHOW UP A RALLIES WHERE MDC LEADERS SPEAK.  IN </p><p>RELATION TO THE RECENT DEATH OF WHITE FARMER GLORIA OLDS </p><p>(REFTEL), NYATHI STATED THAT IN BULAWAYO HE OVERHEARD </p><p>VICE-PRESIDENT MSIKA TALKING ABOUT OLDS\' DEATH TO A </p><p>COLLEAGUE IN NDEBELE.  MSIKA REPORTEDLY SAID "WE FIXED </p><p>HER" AND "THEY THOUGHT WE WERE JOKING." </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION DYNAMICS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN REGARD TO THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI STATED THAT HE NO LONGER BELIEVES MUGABE WILL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HOLD AN EARLY ELECTION.  A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IS NOT </p><p>POSSIBLE IN THE MASHONALAND PROVINCES BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>HIGH LEVEL OF INTIMIDATION THEY HAVE SUFFERED SINCE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7098 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00969  02 OF 02  091557Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------CFC1A8  091557Z /38 </p><p>O 091555Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8388 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000969 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TPFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/09/11 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH LEADERS OF THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00969  02 OF 02  091557Z </p><p>EARLY LAST YEAR.  NONETHELESS, THE MDC COULD STILL </p><p>GARNER 40 PERCENT OF THE VOTES THERE, TSVANGIRAI </p><p>BELIEVES.  THE KEY BATTLEGROUND WILL BE ZIMBABWE\'S MOST </p><p>POPULOUS PROVINCES, MIDLANDS AND MASVINGO, WHERE A </p><p>CANDIDATE NEEDS TO WIN ONLY 60 PERCENT OF THE VOTE TO </p><p>WIN THE ENTIRE ELECTION, NCUBE OFFERED.  ZANU-PF HAS </p><p>ANTAGONIZED THESE PROVINCES AND OTHERS TO SUCH AN </p><p>EXTENT, THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE THEIR CANDIDATE </p><p>WINNING A MAJORITY OF VOTES THERE. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT CAN THE U.S. DO? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) BELLAMY ASKED THE MDC LEADERS WHAT ROLE THE U.S. </p><p>COULD PLAY IN THESE TRYING TIMES.  NCUBE SUGGESTED A </p><p>VISIT BY ANDREW YOUNG WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE MIGHT </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE PRESIDENT TO MODERATE HIS POLICIES.  THE </p><p>OTHER LEADERS SAID THERE IS REALLY NO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FIGURE (OTHER THAN THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND, THEY QUIPPED, </p><p>AND THAT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN) WHO COULD INFLUENCE </p><p>MUGABE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY.  ALL THREE EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST "HAMMER HOME" THE </p><p>MESSAGE THAT VIOLENCE IS NOT A LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN TOOL, </p><p>AND IT MUST REPEAT IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF IT IS TO </p><p>HAVE ANY IMPACT.  NCUBE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>HAVING FOREIGN ELECTION MONITORS, AND SUPPORTING AND </p><p>TRAINING A LARGE POOL OF DOMESTIC MONITORS DURING, AND </p><p>WELL BEFORE, THE ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF LEADERS MUST BE BROUGHT TO BOOK </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00969  02 OF 02  091557Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN A MARCH 8 MEETING WITH BELLAMY, MDC MP DAVID </p><p>COLTART ARGUED THAT MOST OF THE KILLINGS OF WHITE </p><p>FARMERS, MDC SUPPORTERS, AND GOVERNMENT OPPONENTS CAN BE </p><p>TRACED DIRECTLY TO CONSTITUENCIES AND LOCAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS CONTROLLED BY 10 OR 12 ZANU-PF LEADERS, </p><p>MOST NOTABLY SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA </p><p>AND MINES AND ENERGY MINISTER SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI.  THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST CONDEMN THE CULTURE OF </p><p>IMPUNITY THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY, AND PUT </p><p>POLITICIANS WHO USE VIOLENCE ON NOTICE AND HOLD THEM </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE, HE SAID.  UNLESS THIS MESSAGE IS FORCEFULLY </p><p>CONVEYED TO THE GOZ, THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE THAT THE </p><p>UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE EVEN REMOTELY </p><p>FREE AND FAIR, COLTART INSISTED.  AN ALL-OUT EFFORT MUST </p><p>BE MADE STARTING NOW TO ENSURE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD </p><p>WITH TRANSPARENT PROCESSES AND CAREFUL MONITORING. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
