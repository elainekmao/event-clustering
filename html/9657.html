<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 002121 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, CA, UNGA, AROC, UNAUS </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN RESPONSE TO UNGA INITIATIVES-PART II </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 206381 </p><p> </p><p>     B. OTTAWA 02109 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL MC BRIAN FLORA FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C)  Summary:    The Canadian response to U.S. priority </p><p>initiatives for the UNGA 58 (ref A) was largely supportive. </p><p>The GOC, however, hoped the U.S. would show more flexibility </p><p>on the issue of the International Criminal Court (ICC).  The </p><p>GOC was also uncertain about its stance on a human rights </p><p>resolution against Iran, as its opinion of that country,s </p><p>human rights practices is currently being shaped by the </p><p>unfolding events surrounding the death of the Canadian </p><p>journalist, Zahra Kazemi (ref B).  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Post delivered points contained reftel to various </p><p>Canadian officials at Canada,s Department of Foreign Affairs </p><p>and Trade (DFAIT) on July 21.   On the issue of the Middle </p><p>East peace process, poloff spoke with Peter Taylor, Deputy </p><p>Director of DFAIT,s UN and Commonwealth Affairs Division. </p><p>He said the GOC was very pleased with the U.S. led Roadmap </p><p>and thought the results were, thus far, a cause for optimism. </p><p> According to Taylor, the GOC also agreed that the UNGA was </p><p>the wrong venue to address the Middle East peace process.  He </p><p>said the GOC would support a U.S. led effort to keep </p><p>resolutions on the topic out of the General Assembly, </p><p>however, he doubted the success of any such campaign, saying </p><p>that negotiations between the EU and Arab states were sure to </p><p>produce resolutions.  He felt confident that Canada would </p><p>play no role in the drafting process, however, once these </p><p>resolutions came up for vote, Canada would look at each of </p><p>them individually and support those that it felt were </p><p>evenhanded.  He said Canada would oppose any resolution that </p><p>threatened the security or independence of Israel. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Regarding the International Criminal Court  (ICC), </p><p>poloff spoke with Darryl Robinson, Legal Advisor in DFAIT,s </p><p>UN, Human Rights, and Economics Division.  He said Canada </p><p>understands the U.S. has strong concerns about the ICC.  He </p><p>further stated that Canada would be amenable to developing </p><p>agreed upon approaches to reference the ICC if it helped </p><p>minimize conflicts over UNGA resolutions.  According to </p><p>Robinson, however, the GOC feels the U.S. has weakened or </p><p>stricken several ICC references in recent years without any </p><p>"quid pro quo" being granted.  He felt that if further </p><p>compromises were to be achieved, the U.S. would have to </p><p>exhibit more flexibility on the subject and allow some debate </p><p>that it has previously tried to squash.  Robinson also felt, </p><p>that in the past, the U.S. and its allies have achieved </p><p>difficult compromises on ICC language only to have the U.S. </p><p>reject the previously agreed upon language the following </p><p>year.  He said the GOC hoped that all sides would, where </p><p>possible, adhere to previously agreed upon language from </p><p>year-to-year. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On the topic of General Assembly resolutions </p><p>condemning human rights abuses in Burma, Cambodia, Zimbabwe, </p><p>and Iran, poloff spoke with Kelty Peterson, Human Rights </p><p>Officer in DFAIT,s Human Rights, Humanitarian Affairs, and </p><p>Women,s Equality Division.  She suggested that the GOC would </p><p>likely support resolutions condemning human rights violations </p><p>in Burma, Cambodia, and Zimbabwe.  On the subject of Iran, </p><p>however, the GOC opinion is currently in a state of flux. </p><p>Both Peterson and Taylor felt that the recent case of Zahra </p><p>Kazemi, the Canadian journalist who died in an Iranian jail, </p><p>is causing the GOC to reevaluate its opinions about Iran and </p><p>the country,s human rights practices (ref B).  They </p><p>suggested that how Iran handles this situation may influence </p><p>Canada,s decision to support a resolution against it. </p><p>Taylor asked if the U.S. would sponsor the resolution on Iran </p><p>itself. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Poloff spoke with Taylor about counterterrorism and </p><p>he said Canada agreed with the U.S. that the General Assembly </p><p>provided another excellent opportunity to focus the world,s </p><p>attention on the importance of global counterterrorism </p><p>efforts.  He further said that the GOC has "a high view" of </p><p>the UN,s Committee for Counter Terrorism (CTC) and its </p><p>program to build the capacity of member nations to combat </p><p>terrorism.  He noted that Canada has signed and ratified all </p><p>12 of the International Conventions and Protocols pertaining </p><p>to global terrorism. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
