(C)  SUMMARY.  ACCORDING TO SAG DDG FOR AFRICA WELILE NHLAPO, </p><p>CNDD/FDD REBEL LEADER JEAN BOSCO NDAYIKENGURUKIYE AND FNL REBEL </p><p>LEADER KOSSAN KABURA NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ARUSHA PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>WHILE </p><p>SAG OFFICIALS AND FACILITATOR NELSON MANDELA DOUBT BOTH KOSSAN\'S INTENT </p><p> AND LEADERSHIP ABILITY, THEY HAVE BEEN MORE FAVORABLY IMPRESSED </p><p>WITH JEAN BOSCO\'S WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO DIALOGUE.  MANDELA HAS </p><p>URGED JEAN BOSCO TO DECLARE A UNILATERAL SUSPENSION OF ALL ARMED </p><p>ACTION.  NHLAPO TOLD  SPECIAL ENVOY WOLPE THAT MANDELA IS FRUSTRATED </p><p>WITH THE "GAMES" THE BURUNDIAN PARTIES ARE PLAYING IN ARUSHA.  NHLAPO </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE TIME WAS RIPE TO BRING TOGETHER THE KEY BURUNDIAN PA </p><p>RTIES, WITH INTERNATIONAL ENVOYS IN THE WINGS TO EXERT PRESSURE AS NEED </p><p>ED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  NHLAPO FIRMLY STATED THAT TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT FOR DROC </p><p>NATIONAL DIALOGUE FACILITATOR MASIRE WOULD BE TO GIVE THE CONGOLESE </p><p>THE SIGNAL TO RETURN TO WAR.  SOUTH AFRICA HAS STRONGLY COUNSELED </p><p>MLC LEADER BEMBA TO NOT ADVANCE TOWARD MBANDAKA.

(C)  DURING A JULY 16 LUNCH, S/E WOLPE, WHO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>SPECIAL ADVISOR JOHN PRENDERGAST AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER), OUTLINED FOR </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL (DDG) FOR AFRICA, </p><p> </p><p>WELILE NHLAPO, USG CONCERNS REGARDING THE BURUNDI PEACE PROCESS.  S/E </p><p>WOLPE INFORMED NHLAPO THAT HE AND PRENDERGAST WOULD BE MEETING WITH </p><p>FACILITATOR NELSON MANDELA ON JULY 17, AND WOULD ANNOUNCE THE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL DEPOSIT OF $US500,000 TO THE ARUSHA ACCOUNT, AND THE USG </p><p>DECISION TO ALLOCATE AN ADDITIONAL $500,000, PENDING CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>NOTIFICATION.  THE SPECIAL ENVOY STRESSED THAT, WHILE RELIEVED THAT </p><p>MANDELA HAD DECIDED TO POSTPONE THE SIGNING OF THE ARUSHA PEACE ACCORD </p><p>FROM JULY 20 TO AUGUST 28 (REF B), EVEN THE LATTER DATE WAS PREMATURE. </p><p> </p><p>AS WOLPE RECOUNTED, THE HISTORY OF THE RWANDAN AND SIERRA LEONE PEACE </p><p>PROCESSES ILLUSTRATE THE NEED TO PROPERLY DEAL WITH ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>IMPUNITY AND AMNESTY, AND TO INSURE ALL KEY PLAYERS ARE AT THE TABLE. </p><p>FURTHER, SAID THE SPECIAL ENVOY, THE BURUNDIAN PARTIES HAVE NOT YET </p><p>REACHED AGREEMENT ON CRITICAL AREAS SUCH AS ARMED FORCES INTEGRATION, </p><p>THE DEFINITION OF GENOCIDE, AND WHO WILL LEAD THE TRANSITION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  WHILE WOLPE STRESSED THAT MANDELA HAD ENGENDERED THE BELIEF </p><p>AMONG THE BURUNDIAN PARTIES THAT AN AGREEMENT WAS FEASIBLE, AND HAD </p><p>BROUGHT CORE ISSUES TO THE TABLE, THE SPECIAL ENVOY MAINTAINED THAT A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03942  01 OF 03  181827Z </p><p>MORE REASONABLE GOAL WAS TO SECURE A PEACE AGREEMENT BY THE END OF THE </p><p>CALENDAR YEAR.  WOLPE AND NHLAPO AGREED THAT MANDELA SHOULD BE </p><p>ENCOURAGED TO POSTPONE SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT UNTIL THE BURUNDIAN </p><p>PARTIES HAVE MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>SAG IMPRESSED WITH JEAN BOSCO </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  NHLAPO RECALLED THAT SAG OFFICIALS HAD WARNED FORMER PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>MANDELA THAT MANY OF THE BURUNDIAN PARTIES WERE NEITHER MATURE, NOR </p><p>HONEST.  MANDELA COMPLAINS THAT THE BURUNDIANS ARE NOT COOPERATING ON </p><p>THE ISSUE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, WITH ALL SIDES "PLAYING GAMES." </p><p>NHLAPO ADDED THAT MANDELA IS FRUSTRATED WITH THE ISSUE AND HAS TOLD </p><p>BURUNDIAN PRESIDENT BUYOYA THAT HE SIMPLY CANNOT ACCEPT ANY LEADER THAT </p><p> </p><p>CONTINUES TO HOLD POLITICAL PRISONERS. AFTER POSITIVELY RESPONDING TO </p><p>WOLPE\'S QUERY REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY OF USING AN INTERNATIONAL PANEL </p><p> </p><p>TO ASSIST IN DEFINING POLITICAL PRISONERS, NHLAPO INDICATED THAT </p><p>MANDELA HAD TO FIRST CLEAR ON THE IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>6.

FOR EXAMPLE, ILLUSTRATED NHLAPO, JEAN </p><p> </p><p>BOSCO REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IN EXPLAINING PORTIONS OF THE ARUSHA </p><p>DOCUMENTS.  THE REBEL LEADER, SAID NHLAPO, IS "NOT PLAYING GAMES," AND </p><p>SAG OFFICIALS HAVE ORGANIZED HIS TRAVEL TO ARUSHA FOR THE JULY 19 - 20 </p><p>SUMMIT.  ON THE OTHER HAND, NHLAPO STRESSED THAT JEAN BOSCO IS "TREATED </p><p> </p><p>LIKE A KING" IN LUBUMBASHI, WHICH MAKES HIS WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN THE ARUSHA TALKS MORE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN.  NHLAPO ADDED THAT IT </p><p>APPEARED THAT ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MUGABE, UPON PRESIDENT MBEKI\'S </p><p>REQUEST, DID DISCUSS JEAN BOSCO\'S POSITION WITH KABILA.  AS A RESULT, </p><p>JEAN BOSCO MAY NOW HAVE MORE FREEDOM OF MANEUVER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  ACCORDING TO NHLAPO, MANDELA HAS SUGGESTED TO JEAN BOSCO THAT </p><p>THE REBEL LEADER DECLARE A UNILATERAL SUSPENSION OF ALL ARMED ACTION, </p><p>AS SUCH A MOVE WOULD ENHANCE JEAN BOSCO\'S POLITICAL CREDIBILITY. </p><p>FURTHER, AN EFFECTIVE SUSPENSION WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE REBEL LEADER\'S </p><p>COMMAND AND CONTROL ABILITY.  JEAN BOSCO HAS HESITATED TO DO SO, </p><p>RECOUNTED NHLAPO, BECAUSE IT COULD "IMPLY SURRENDER."  UPON HIS RETURN </p><p>FROM BUJUMBURA, SAID NHLAPO, MANDELA WROTE TO BOTH JEAN BOSCO AND FNL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03942  02 OF 03  181827Z </p><p>LEADER KOSSAN KABURA, AGAIN URGING THEM TO SUSPEND MILITARY ACTION, </p><p>ARGUING THAT THEY WOULD BENEFIT BY JOINING THE ARUSHA PROCESS. </p><p>KOSSAN\'S RESPONSE TO THE LETTER, RECOUNTED NHLAPO, WAS TO INVITE </p><p>MANDELA TO VISIT THE REBEL LEADER\'S "LIBERATED" AREAS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>NHLAPO, THE SAG HAS SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT KOSSAN\'S LEADERSHIP </p><p>ABILITY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, JEAN BOSCO\'S "MORE MATURE" ANSWER, SAID </p><p>NHLAPO, INDICATED HE WAS RECEPTIVE TO FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH MANDELA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  JEAN BOSCO\'S RECEPTIVENESS NOTWITHSTANDING, NHLAPO MAINTAINED </p><p>THAT IF JEAN BOSCO AND KOSSAN EITHER REFUSED TO JOIN THE ARUSHA PROCESS </p><p> </p><p>OR COULD NOT DELIVER ON A CEASE-FIRE, THE TWO REBEL LEADERS NEEDED TO </p><p>BE MARGINALIZED OR ELSE THEY IN TURN COULD DERAIL THE ENTIRE PROCESS. </p><p>AS THE BURUNDIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT SURE OF THE EXTENT OF THE REBELS\' </p><p>COMMAND AND CONTROL, NHLAPO EMPHASIZED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>NEEDED TO EMBARK ON A "SERIOUS ANALYSIS" OF THESE MOVEMENTS IN ORDER TO </p><p> </p><p>OBTAIN A CLEARER IDEA OF THE REBELS\' ACTUAL STRENGTH.  AS AN ASIDE, </p><p>NHLAPO ALSO NOTED THAT JEAN BOSCO\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE ARUSHA TALKS </p><p>THREATENED NYANGOMA\'S POSITION; HE INDICATED THAT MANDELA MUST MAKE A </p><p>SPECIAL EFFORT TO MEET WITH NYANGOMA DURING THE JULY 19-20 SUMMIT. </p><p> </p><p>BROADENING ARUSHA </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  S/E WOLPE TOLD NHLAPO THAT DON MATTEO ZUPPI ALSO BELIEVED THAT </p><p> </p><p>MANDELA NEEDED TO BE PERSUADED NOT TO INSIST ON A SIGNING OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENT IN AUGUST.  WOLPE ADDED THAT DON MATTEO HOPED THE JULY 19 -20 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03942  02 OF 03  181827Z </p><p>SUMMIT WOULD CRYSTALLIZE DISCUSSION ON OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND ENABLE </p><p>THE KEY FIVE OR SIX ACTORS TO MEET TOGETHER TO WORK ON THESE PROBLEMS. </p><p>NHLAPO SUGGESTED THAT IF SUCH A GATHERING OF KEY BURUNDIAN PLAYERS WAS </p><p>TO BE ORGANIZED, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE INTERNATIONAL ENVOYS </p><p>PRESENT TO EXERT PRESSURE AS NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>DROC:  PROBLEMS AHEAD </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO S/E WOLPE\'S COMMENT THAT THE USG HAD NOT </p><p>RECEIVED A READOUT FROM ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S RECENT TRIP TO THE </p><p>DROC, NHLAPO INDICATED THAT THE SAG HAD NOT RECEIVED ONE EITHER, AS ITS </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR WAS CURRENTLY IN SOUTH AFRICA ON MEDICAL LEAVE.  THE SPECIAL </p><p> </p><p>ENVOY STRESSED THAT NAMIBIAN PRESIDENT SAM NUJOMA HAD WORRIED SEVERAL </p><p>CONGRESSMEN RECENTLY WHEN HE STATED THAT THE SADC ALLIES NO LONGER </p><p>SUPPORTED NATIONAL DIALOGUE FACILITATOR MASIRE.  WOLPE STRESSED THAT </p><p>THE USG BELIEVES IT WOULD BE A DISASTER TO THE PEACE PROCESS IF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WERE TO ACQUIESCE IN KABILA\'S REJECTION OF </p><p>MASIRE.  NHLAPO CONCURRED AND ADDED THAT TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT FOR MASIRE </p><p> </p><p>WOULD GIVE DROC PARTIES THE PRETEXT FOR A RENEWAL OF WAR IN THE CONGO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3099 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03942  03 OF 03  181831Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EUR-00   VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------6FA4C3  181831Z /07 </p><p>O 181550Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6645 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003942 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR A/S SUSAN RICE AND PDAS POWELL </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR GAMBINO </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03942  03 OF 03  181831Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2005 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, BY, CF, SF, TZ, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: S/E WOLPE\'S MEETING WITH SAG DDG FOR AFRICA </p><p>WELILE NHLAPO </p><p> </p><p>EMPHASIZING THAT A FULL DEPLOYMENT OF MONUC FORCES DEPENDED UPON </p><p>KABILA\'S COMPLYING WITH ALL THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT PROVISIONS, WOLPE </p><p>NOTED THAT KABILA STILL REFUSED MONUC FULL ACCESS AND WAS NOW EMBARKED </p><p>ON AN OFFENSIVE IN EQUATEUR PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  RECOUNTING RECENT TELEPHONE CALLS HE AND PERMANENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE HOLBROOKE RECEIVED FROM MLC LEADER BEMBA REGARDING </p><p>KABILA\'S OFFENSIVE AGAINST MLC FORCES AND HIS FRUSTRATION WITH THE </p><p>USG\'S ADMONITION TO STAY IN PLACE AND NOT ATTACK MBANDAKA (REF A), </p><p>WOLPE STRESSED THAT THE USG REMAINED FIRM IN ITS POSITION OF </p><p>DISCOURAGING ANY OFFENSIVE ACTION, EVEN IN REACTION TO AN ATTACK. </p><p>NHLAPO AGREED, NOTING THAT BEMBA HAD ALSO INDICATED TO THE SAG THAT HE </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD "A LITTLE BIT," BUT THAT SOUTH AFRICA HAD </p><p>STRONGLY COUNSELED AGAINST SUCH ACTION.  ACCORDING TO NHLAPO, BEMBA </p><p>REMAINS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS CREDIBILITY WITH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  NHLAPO ADDED THAT BEMBA CLAIMED HE WAS UNDER </p><p>PRESSURE FROM HIS MILITARY COMMANDERS TO TAKE MBANDAKA, WHICH WOULD </p><p>PLACE HIS FORCES IN A DIRECT LINE TO KINSHASA.  IN RETURN, THE SAG HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY TOLD BEMBA TO EXERT HIS COMMAND AND CONTROL TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>NO MOVE IS MADE TOWARDS MBANDAKA.  WOLPE NOTED THAT THE USG WAS SEEKING </p><p> </p><p>CONFIRMATION OF BEMBA\'S CLAIM THAT HE HAS WITHDRAWN HIS FORCES TO THE </p><p>KAMPALA CEASE-FIRE LINE.  IF SO, SAID WOLPE, KABILA\'S RECENT ATTACKS </p><p>HAVE VIOLATED BOTH THE KAMPALA AND LUSAKA AGREEMENTS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03942  03 OF 03  181831Z </p><p> </p><p>12.

(C) IT APPEARS THAT USG AND SAG ANALYSIS AND PRESCRIPTION ARE IN </p><p>SYNCH, WITH RESPECT TO BOTH THE DRC AND BURUNDI PEACE PROCESSES.
