Suggested </p><p>"if asked" press guidance is contained in Para 12.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Public Statement by the PA </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) President Kumaratunga\'s party, the People\'s </p><p>Alliance (PA), issued a public statement late </p><p>November 15 harshly criticizing the government\'s </p><p>handling of the peace process.  The statement also </p><p>criticized Norway\'s facilitation role.  (Note:  A copy </p><p>of the statement has been faxed to SA/INS.)  The </p><p>statement was issued in the name of Sarath Amunugama, </p><p>the PA\'s media spokesman, but was almost certainly the </p><p>work of former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a </p><p>close adviser to Kumaratunga.  (Note:  Kadirgamar </p><p>reviewed the statement line-by-line at a November 15 </p><p>press conference called by the PA.)  Key snippets from </p><p>the long and detailed statement included: </p><p> </p><p>-- "The UNF (United National Front) and some </p><p>governments, notably the Norwegian, say that the talks </p><p>with the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) are </p><p>proceeding in the right direction.  In the opinion of </p><p>the People\'s Alliance, the direction of the talks is </p><p>right only for the LTTE." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Recent actions of the LTTE demonstrate a clear trend </p><p>towards the consolidation of its authority in the </p><p>northern and eastern provinces...The LTTE has spoken </p><p>publicly of already having a standing navy, law courts, </p><p>police stations, banks, and other institutions...Those </p><p>actions appear to reflect the LTTE\'s intention to create </p><p>and dominate some kind of parallel governmental entity </p><p>in the north and east...which would lead inevitably to </p><p>the establishment of a separate state." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The PA also views with concern the role currently </p><p>being played by the Norwegian government in the </p><p>negotiation process...Today, it appears to the people of </p><p>Sri Lanka that the role of the Norwegian government has </p><p>been unjustifiably enlarged and that it is no longer </p><p>visibly impartial...The Norwegian government seems more </p><p>concerned with arranging an outcome of the talks that </p><p>can be pronounced a `success\' for the UNF and the LTTE </p><p>rather than with the long-term interests of Sri Lanka </p><p>and its people.  The destiny of Sri Lanka is too </p><p>precious to be left to be determined by the UNF and the </p><p>LTTE under the supervision of the government of Norway." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The prime minister and his negotiating team have not </p><p>yet, after eleven months of the current peace process, </p><p>thought it fit to inform the country, the president, and </p><p>the Parliament and perhaps even most of the cabinet, of </p><p>the policy framework which would form the basis for </p><p>negotiations." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In its conclusion, the statement also made a </p><p>series of demands, including that the GSL insist that </p><p>the LTTE renounce the use of violence and accept </p><p>decommissioning of all of its weapons.  The statement </p><p>also called for the government to do more public </p><p>briefing re its plans for the peace process, noting that </p><p>the PA planned to begin a process of "national </p><p>consultations."  Finally, the statement demanded that </p><p>the government seek a "thorough revision" of the </p><p>February ceasefire accord, which was "being implemented </p><p>to the grave prejudice of the armed forces of Sri </p><p>Lanka." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Criticism of the U.S. and UK </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The PA statement was also critical of U.S. and </p><p>UK participation in the upcoming Oslo donors\' </p><p>conference, stating: </p><p> </p><p>"The PA is disturbed by the impending accommodation of </p><p>the LTTE, on a level of parity with the government of </p><p>Sri Lanka, at the forthcoming talks to be held in Oslo. </p><p>It is said that at these talks the governments of the </p><p>U.S. and the UK will be represented at a high political </p><p>level...The signal that will go out from Oslo is that, </p><p>notwithstanding resounding universal declarations that </p><p>terrorism must be resisted in all its manifestations, </p><p>terrorism will in fact be rewarded." </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  This aspect of the PA statement was also </p><p>mirrored in recent editorials in "The Island," a </p><p>strongly anti-LTTE, Sinhalese chauvinist daily.  In </p><p>reference to Oslo, the editorials essentially charged </p><p>the U.S. and UK were soft toward the LTTE, while </p><p>asserting a hard-line policy toward other terrorist </p><p>groups, e.g., Al-Qaida.  Meanwhile, in a clearly </p><p>erroneous report, one of the Sunday English-language </p><p>dailies, asserted on November 17 that the U.S. and UK </p><p>were thinking of legalizing the LTTE after the </p><p>conclusion of the Oslo conference.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s Recent Comments </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Somewhat at odds with her own party\'s </p><p>statement, the president\'s public stance on the peace </p><p>process has been relatively upbeat.  In a wide-ranging </p><p>speech on November 12 commemorating her eighth year in </p><p>office, President Kumaratunga seemed to regard the GSL\'s </p><p>peace initiative in relatively benign fashion, stating: </p><p> </p><p>"I am glad that the new government of the UNP (United </p><p>National Party) has taken action to carry forward the </p><p>peace process through a negotiated settlement...Measures </p><p>adopted in the last one year to reduce tension between </p><p>the antagonists seem to have progressed satisfactorily. </p><p>It is gladdening to note that the government has taken </p><p>serious note of my insistence on the necessity to engage </p><p>in a dialogue with the LTTE on the core issues..." </p><p> </p><p>Kumaratunga was also relatively conciliatory regarding </p><p>the peace process during brief remarks on November 17 at </p><p>a ceremony honoring the visiting Croatian president (see </p><p>Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Reactions to the Statement </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The PA statement received considerable coverage </p><p>in the weekend press.  At a late November 16 meeting </p><p>with the Ambassador and DCM, Milinda Moragoda, a key </p><p>minister involved in peace process issues, and Norwegian </p><p>Ambassador Jon Westborg both expressed considerable </p><p>concern about the PA statement.  Moragoda indicated that </p><p>Prime Minister Wickremesinghe planned to respond in </p><p>public to the statement later this week.  He added that </p><p>the PM planned to make a national address thoroughly </p><p>reviewing the government\'s peace initiative at some </p><p>point after the November 25 donors\' conference in Oslo. </p><p>The normally unflappable Westborg, who was clearly a bit </p><p>stung by the PA statement, was not certain how his </p><p>government would respond.  (Note:  For his part, </p><p>Westborg also faced some biting personal criticism last </p><p>week.  Citing press reporting on Westborg\'s comments at </p><p>a private meeting, some in the radical JVP party </p><p>asserted he had made light of the recent conviction of </p><p>LTTE leader Prabhakaran for a 1996 terrorist attack.  In </p><p>response to the JVP\'s ludicrous charge, Westborg said he </p><p>had been misquoted.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Ambassador, underscoring strong U.S. support </p><p>for the GoN role, told Moragoda and Westborg that he </p><p>thought that the statement was a cheap shot, mean- </p><p>spirited, and ill-timed.  It was possible, the </p><p>Ambassador noted nevertheless, that the statement could </p><p>result in a net positive if the GSL shrewdly used it in </p><p>its discussions with the LTTE as a means to gain </p><p>concessions. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In other soundings, Desmond Fernando, a human </p><p>rights lawyer with close links to the government, told </p><p>polchief that he thought that the PA statement was "very </p><p>unhelpful."  Fernando added that he thought that the PA </p><p>was edging toward playing the same game that had </p><p>bedeviled past peace processes, i.e., the party out of </p><p>power playing the "Sinhalese card" in order to gain </p><p>popular support at the expense of the national interest </p><p>in communal harmony.  Kedish Loganathan, an analyst at a </p><p>local think-tank, thought that the PA would be careful </p><p>not to go too far in their criticism because it would </p><p>not want to alienate the public, which was strongly pro- </p><p>peace process.  In making this point, Loganathan took </p><p>note of President Kumaratunga\'s recent comments and the </p><p>fact that they were far more moderate in tone than the </p><p>PA statement itself. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) (((Note:  Mission has not picked up any response </p><p>by the LTTE to the PA statement.  The Tamil National </p><p>Alliance, which is generally pro-LTTE, rejected much of </p><p>the substance of the PA statement in a press release </p><p>dated November 17, specifically underscoring its strong </p><p>support for Norway\'s facilitation effort.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The PA statement is on the mark in some ways, </p><p>e.g., the LTTE is indeed doing some very nasty things in </p><p>the north and east (see Ref C).  That said, while it is </p><p>important to call attention to the LTTE\'s misdeeds, </p><p>there can be little doubt that the peace process is </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s best way forward.  The thrust of the PA\'s </p><p>statement seems to call into question that basic </p><p>premise, however.  The PA\'s attack is especially </p><p>unfortunate and ill-timed given the upcoming Oslo </p><p>conference and the slated start of the third round of </p><p>talks shortly thereafter.  In addition, the criticism of </p><p>the Norwegians is extremely unfair, as is the glancing </p><p>blow at the U.S. and the UK.  While the exact genesis of </p><p>the statement is difficult to discern, the PA is clearly </p><p>envious and resentful that the GSL is getting the credit </p><p>for the peace process, which it feels (correctly) that </p><p>it started eight years ago when Kumaratunga first took </p><p>power.  We also guess that a "good cop, bad cop" routine </p><p>is going on here, with Kumaratunga keeping her hands </p><p>clean while she gives her party license to hit out </p><p>(there is little doubt that the statement would not have </p><p>been issued without the president\'s review and </p><p>approval). </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) At this point, given the strong support for the </p><p>peace process among the body politic, we do not see the </p><p>PA statement as making a big impact, but it could be a </p><p>portent of attacks to come.  The Ambassador will bring </p><p>up our concerns in upcoming meetings with Kumaratunga </p><p>and Kadirgamar.  END COMMENT. </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Suggested Press Guidance </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) The following is suggested "if asked" press </p><p>guidance in case the Department is questioned re the PA </p><p>statement: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>"We have noted with dismay the November 15 statement </p><p>made by the People\'s Alliance (PA).  The tone of the </p><p>statement is unduly harsh and corrosive with respect to </p><p>cohabitation between the major parties regarding the </p><p>peace process.  The U.S. strongly believes that the Sri </p><p>Lankan government is moving the peace process in the </p><p>right direction, and we urge all concerned parties to </p><p>reinforce that effort and not try to undermine it.  In </p><p>addition, some of the statement\'s charges are wildly </p><p>inaccurate.  In particular, we take issue with the </p><p>statement\'s charges against the government of Norway. </p><p>We strongly believe that the Norwegian facilitation </p><p>effort is impartial, transparent, and nobly motivated. </p><p>In fact, we believe that Sri Lanka and the entire </p><p>international community owe Norway a debt of gratitude. </p><p> </p><p>As regards the U.S., we reject the statement\'s implicit </p><p>assertion that we are somehow softening our approach to </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.  At the upcoming </p><p>Oslo conference, no U.S. officials will be meeting with </p><p>the group and the LTTE will remain on the U.S. Foreign </p><p>Terrorist Organization (FTO) listing. </p><p> </p><p>We remain deeply concerned by LTTE activities, and </p><p>continue to urge the LTTE to renounce terrorism and </p><p>violence publicly.  The group should also make clear </p><p>once and for all that it has no intention whatsoever to </p><p>press for separatism.  We also call on the LTTE to </p><p>respect human rights and democratic norms, and urge it </p><p>to accept Sri Lankan government sovereignty fully, </p><p>including the island-wide application of the nation\'s </p><p>constitution and its law enforcement system." </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
