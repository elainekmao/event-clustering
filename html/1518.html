<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KINSHASA 000703 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/08/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT DISMISSED:  STEP ONE IN CABINET </p><p>RESHUFFLE </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>1. (C) "CURRENT AFFAIRS ONLY" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>WE UNDERSTAND THAT ON FEBRUARY 7 PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA </p><p>FORMALLY NOTIFIED ALL MEMBERS OF THE CABINET THAT THEY ARE </p><p>DISMISSED AS FAR AS THEIR PRESENT MANDATE IS CONCERNED AND </p><p>ARE, HENCEFORTH, TO ATTEND ONLY TO "CURRENT AFFAIRS."  (THIS </p><p>MEANS, AT A MINIMUM, NO NEW ACTIVITIES OR INITIATIVES UNTIL </p><p>FURTHER NOTICE OR AS HE DIRECTS.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) CLEARING THE WAY FOR CHANGE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED HERE THAT THIS FORMAL NOTICE TO THE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE LAST GOVERNMENT APPOINTED BY HIS FATHER, THE </p><p>LATE PRESIDENT LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA, CLEARS THE WAY FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA TO BEGIN CONSULTATIONS WHICH WILL </p><p>LEAD TO A RESHUFFLED -- PROBABLY LARGELY NEW -- CABINET.  WE </p><p>JUDGE, HOWEVER, THAT THE NEW TEAM IS NOT LIKELY TO BE </p><p>ANNOUNCED OFFICIALLY UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTY-DAY PERIOD </p><p>OF PUBLIC MOURNING, THAT IS, AROUND FEBRUARY 18. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) ...AND CLEANING HOUSE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>AT ANY RATE, JOSEPH KABILA CAN USEFULLY USE A BIT MORE TIME </p><p>AS HE SEEKS TO HIVE OFF SOME OF THE DEADWOOD IN THE CURRENT </p><p>CABINET.  A GOODLY NUMBER OF THESE ARE NON-PERFORMERS AND </p><p>OTHERS DOWNRIGHT OBSTRUCTIONISTS TO PROGRESS ON THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS AND THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS WHICH YOUNG </p><p>KABILA HAS STATED HIS INTENTION TO CARRY OUT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) A PRIME MINISTER LIKELY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>MORE THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE LATE LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA </p><p>ARRIVED IN KINSHASA IN 1997, THERE APPEARS TO BE A </p><p>BETTER-THAN-FIFTY PERCENT CHANCE THAT A PRIME MINISTER WILL </p><p>BE APPOINTED.  WHILE LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA WAS NEVER ABLE TO </p><p>BRING HIMSELF TO SHARE POWER AND THE LIMELIGHT WITH A PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, JOSEPH KABILA HAS SO FAR DEMONSTRATED THAT HE IS </p><p>BETTER ORGANIZED AND LESS DEFENSIVE.  HE IS PROBABLY ALSO </p><p>KEENLY AWARE OF THE ENORMITY OF HIS TASK AND SENSES THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE IN HIS AND THE CONGO\'S INTEREST FOR HIM TO HAVE </p><p>SOMEONE AT HIS SIDE WHO COULD MANAGE THE DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT WHILE HE ENGAGES IN NEGOTIATIONS ON THE LARGER </p><p>ISSUES OF PEACE AND RECONCILIATION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>5. (C) NO SHORTAGE OF PM CANDIDATES </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS, IN THIS REGARD, WILD SPECULATION HERE ABOUT WHO THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER MIGHT BE.  THE NAMES MENTIONED MOST FREQUENTLY </p><p>INCLUDE:  PLANNING MINISTER DENIS KALUME (WHO TOOK CHARGE OF </p><p>THE KABILA FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS); MOBUTU\'S LAST PRIME </p><p>MINISTER GERARD LIKULIA BOLONGO; AND PROFESSOR Z\'AHIDI NGOMA, </p><p>HEAD OF A SMALL POLITICAL PARTY AND FORMER REBEL RCD </p><p>OFFICIAL.  LESS OFTEN MENTIONED -- AND WHOSE APPOINTMENT </p><p>WOULD BE FEARED BY MANY -- IS JUSTICE MINISTER MWENZE </p><p>KONGOLO.  (OTHERS OF THE OLD GUARD AROUND LAURENT-DESIRE </p><p>KABILA SUCH AS INTERIOR MINISTER KAKUDJI AND FORMER FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER YERODIA ARE BELIEVED TO BE ON THEIR WAY OUT, OR AT </p><p>LEAST TO POSITIONS OF MUCH LESS IMPORT.)  CURRENT FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER OKITUNDU\'S NAME CAME UP INITIALLY IN THE PM RACE, </p><p>BUT HE MAY NOT YET BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE QUITE THE HEFT </p><p>REQUIRED AND, IN ANY CASE, HAS ALREADY MADE  HIMSELF TOO </p><p>VALUABLE IN HIS SHORT TIME AS FOREIGN MINISTER TO BE RELEASED </p><p>FOR OTHER DUTIES. </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
