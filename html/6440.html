<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 USUN NEW YORK 000727 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UNSC, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: NO VOTE ON THE RESOLUTION; SUBDUED COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. USUN 716 </p><p>     B. USUN 637 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT; REASONS: </p><p> 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  A SUBDUED SECURITY COUNCIL MET IN INFORMALS </p><p>ON MARCH 17 TO RECEIVE WORD THAT THE U.S., UK, AND SPAIN HAD </p><p>CHOSEN NOT TO BRING THEIR RESOLUTION TO A VOTE, BUT WOULD </p><p>INSTEAD "RESERVE THEIR RIGHT TO TAKE THEIR OWN STEPS TO </p><p>SECURE THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ." SYG ANNAN AND MOST COUNCIL </p><p>MEMBERS EXPRESSED SADNESS AND FRUSTRATION THAT A COMPROMISE </p><p>COULD NOT BE REACHED.  UNMOVIC EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN BLIX </p><p>ANNOUNCED THE UNMOVIC WORK PROGRAM WITH ITS KEY REMAINING </p><p>DISARMAMENT TASKS (KRDTS) WOULD BE READY THE AFTERNOON OF </p><p>MARCH 17.  ANNAN ANNOUNCED THE SUSPENSION OF ALL UN </p><p>OPERATIONS IN IRAQ AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL UN PERSONNEL. </p><p>RUSSIA, DRAWING FROM THE MARCH 15 RUSSIAN - FRENCH - GERMAN </p><p>DECLARATION (REF A), PUSHED FOR A COUNCIL MEETING ON </p><p>WEDNESDAY, MARCH 19, TO DISCUSS APPROVAL OF THE WORK PROGRAM </p><p>AND KRDTS.  MOST COUNCIL MEMBERS (EVEN THE THREE AFRICAN </p><p>STATES WHOSE FMS WILL BE IN NEW YORK ON TUESDAY, MARCH 18 FOR </p><p>AN UNRELATED MEETING) HEDGED ON MINISTERIAL ATTENDANCE.  THE </p><p>RUSSIANS MAY CONTINUE TO PROBE FOR POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC </p><p>AREAS, BUT HAVE NOT AS YET SURFACED A RESOLUTION PUSHING FOR </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO ADOPT THE WORK PROGRAM.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>RUSSIAN PERMREP LAVROV SEEMED RESIGNED TO THE REALITY OF THE </p><p>SITUATION, AND SOUGHT TO MINIMIZE DIFFERENCES, UNLIKE HIS </p><p>FRENCH AND GERMAN COLLEAGUES. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) GERMAN AND FRENCH PERMREPS BOTH PUSHED BACK ON THE </p><p>U.S. - UK - SPANISH EXPLANATION REGARDING THE DRAFT </p><p>RESOLUTION, ASSERTING THAT THE RESOLUTION WOULD NOT HAVE HAD </p><p>BACKING FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL, AND MEXICAN PERMREP </p><p>AGUILAR-ZINSER OUTLINED (AGAIN) MEXICO\'S POSITION THAT USE OF </p><p>FORCE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION WAS A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAW.  CHILE WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS UNHELPFUL, ASSERTING THAT </p><p>INSPECTIONS WERE WORKING AND SHOULD BE CONTINUED; THE AFRICAN </p><p>STATES COLLECTIVELY WERE LESS CONTENTIOUS, FOCUSING INSTEAD </p><p>ON THE FAILURE OF THE COUNCIL TO ACHIEVE UNITY.  FINALLY, </p><p>PAKISTANI PERMREP AKRAM CAREFULLY AVOIDED SAYING MUCH THAT </p><p>COULD BE INTERPRETED IN EITHER DIRECTION. COUNCIL MEMBERS ALL </p><p>STOOD BEHIND SYG ANNAN\'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW UN PERSONNEL, </p><p>NOTING THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE IN THE INTEREST OF THEIR </p><p>SAFETY.  LAVROV LAID A MARKER THAT THE COUNCIL DID NOT </p><p>"SUPPORT" THE SYG\'S DECISION BUT RATHER "NOTED" IT, AS THE </p><p>PHRASEOLOGY TO BE USED IN ANY STATEMENT TO THE PRESS TO BE </p><p>MADE BY THE COUNCIL PRESIDENT (GUINEA). END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UK: ACTION ON UNSCR IS OFF; IRAQ CAN STILL ACT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AFTER ANNOUNCING TO THE PRESS THE CO-SPONSORS\' </p><p>DECISION NOT TO CALL FOR A VOTE ON THEIR DRAFT RESOLUTION </p><p>(REF B), UK PERMREP GREENSTOCK CONVEYED THE SAME MESSAGE IN </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL CONSULTATIONS.  HE SPECIFIED THAT THE </p><p>CO-SPONSORS HAD NOT ACTUALLY WITHDRAWN IT AS HAD BEEN </p><p>MISREPORTED IN THE PRESS.  HE REITERATED THAT THE RESOLUTION </p><p>REMAINS ON THE TABLE. GREENSTOCK SAID THE UK HAD HELD </p><p>INTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS AND HAD CONCLUDED THAT COUNCIL </p><p>CONSENSUS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE IN LINE WITH RESOLUTION 1441. </p><p>HE EXPLAINED THAT "ONE COUNTRY IN PARTICULAR HAS UNDERLINED </p><p>ITS INTENTION TO VETO ANY ULTIMATUM \'NO MATTER WHAT THE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES.\'"  GREENSTOCK CONTINUED THAT THAT COUNTRY </p><p>(NOTE: FRANCE. END NOTE.) "REJECTED OUR COMPROMISE PROPOSAL </p><p>BEFORE EVEN THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT ITSELF AND HAS PUT FORWARD </p><p>SUGGESTIONS THAT WOULD ROW BACK ON THE UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT OF </p><p>THE COUNCIL IN 1441 - THOSE SUGGESTIONS WOULD AMOUNT TO NO </p><p>ULTIMATUM, NO PRESSURE, AND NO DISARMAMENT."  HE SAID THAT </p><p>"THE CO-SPONSORS RESERVE THEIR RIGHT TO TAKE THEIR OWN STEPS </p><p>TO SECURE THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) GREENSTOCK SAID, IN THE VIEW OF HMG, IT WAS STILL </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR SADDAM HUSSEIN TO DEMONSTRATE HE HAD MADE THE </p><p>STRATEGIC DECISION TO DISARM AND CALLED FOR IRAQ TO TAKE THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE STEPS.  HE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN UNMOVIC </p><p>PRESENTING ITS WORK PROGRAM AND KRDTS TO THE COUNCIL, SAYING </p><p>THAT THE UK WAS OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS ON ITS PROVISIONS. </p><p>GREENSTOCK WARNED THAT ANY PROGRESS ON THE WORK PROGRAM OR </p><p>THE KRDTS WAS PREDICATED ON OVERALL IRAQI COOPERATION.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE UK ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD JUST RELEASED A RULING </p><p>ON THE LEGALITY OF ACTION AGAINST IRAQ AND THAT THE UK </p><p>MISSION WOULD DISTRIBUTE THAT RULING TO COUNCIL MEMBERS. </p><p>GREENSTOCK RESERVED THE UK\'S POSITION ON ATTENDING THE </p><p>PROPOSED MINISTERIAL BUT, IN THE EVENT FS STRAW DID COME, HE </p><p>WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ARRIVE UNTIL WEDNESDAY. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>U.S.: RESOLUTION IS OFF; UNMOVIC AND IAEA OUT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE SUPPORTED GREENSTOCK\'S </p><p>EXPLANATION OF ACTION ON THE DRAFT RESOLUTION.  HE REGRETTED </p><p>THAT, IN THE FACE OF A CERTAIN VETO THREAT, THAT THERE WAS NO </p><p>PURPOSE IN PURSUING THE DRAFT RESOLUTION ANY FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THEN EXPLAINED CALLS HE AND </p><p>OTHER USG OFFICIALS HAD MADE TO UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA ON MARCH </p><p>16, SAYING THAT THE U.S. HAD PROMISED THE UN THAT IT WOULD </p><p>PROVIDE ADVANCE WARNING WHEN IT WAS TIME TO WITHDRAW </p><p>INSPECTORS FROM IRAQ.  HE SAID THE U.S. HAD ASKED THE WEAPONS </p><p>INSPECTORS TO TAKE "EXPEDITIOUS ACTION" TO SUSPEND THEIR </p><p>OPERATIONS IN IRAQ AND TO REMOVE ALL PERSONNEL FROM THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE SAID THAT THE WARNING DID NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WAR WAS IMMINENT, BUT THAT THE U.S. </p><p>WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE FURTHER WARNINGS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BLIX: WORK PROGRAM READY; DETAILS ON WORK </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) UNMOVIC EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN BLIX EXPLAINED THAT COPIES </p><p>OF THE DRAFT WORK PROGRAM WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE AFTERNOON </p><p>OF MARCH 17.  BLIX REVIEWED THE REQUIREMENTS BEHIND THE WORK </p><p>PROGRAM AND KRDTS, AND SAID THE "CLUSTER" DOCUMENT DELIVERED </p><p>ON MARCH 7 HAD OUTLINED THE RANGE OF DISARMAMENT ISSUES.  THE </p><p>WORK PROGRAM WOULD CONTAIN 12 KEY REMAINING DISARMAMENT </p><p>TASKS, ALONG WITH DETAILS OF HOW UNMOVIC INTENDED TO GO ABOUT </p><p>ITS WORK. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) BLIX CONTRASTED THE KRDTS WITH VARIOUS COUNCIL </p><p>"BENCHMARK" PROPOSALS, SAYING THAT UNMOVIC DID NOT USE THE </p><p>TERM BENCHMARKS.  BLIX THOUGHT THE VALUE OF BENCHMARKS, SUCH </p><p>AS THOSE PROPOSED LAST WEEK BY THE UK, RESIDED IN THEIR </p><p>ABILITY TO BUILD CONFIDENCE AMONG THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>IRAQ\'S WMD PROGRAMS.   BLIX SAID UNMOVIC\'S ROLE IN A </p><p>BENCHMARK-BASED EXERCISE WOULD BE TO REPORT BACK </p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME.  HE ALSO CLARIFIED </p><p>THAT DISCUSSION OF A 120-DAY TIME PERIOD FOR UNMOVIC REFERRED </p><p>TO UNSCR 1284-BASED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND WAS NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY LINKED TO THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO DISARM IRAQ, </p><p>WHICH HE REPEATED WOULD TAKE "NOT DAYS, NOT YEARS, BUT </p><p>MONTHS." </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) BLIX TOUCHED ON CHALLENGES IN ASSESSING PROGRESS IN </p><p>VARIOUS AREAS.  MISSILES COULD BE VERIFIED AS THEY WERE </p><p>DESTROYED - HE NOTED THAT 70 OF THE AL-SAMOUD MISSILES HAD </p><p>BEEN DESTROYED SO FAR - AND THE REQUESTED DOCUMENTATION ON </p><p>UAVS SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY TO DELIVER.  HOWEVER, IN THOSE </p><p>CASES WHERE THERE WAS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE IRAQIS </p><p>ACTUALLY HAD A SYSTEM - E.G., ANTHRAX OR MOBILE CW OR BW LABS </p><p>- THE SITUATION WOULD BE MORE COMPLICATED.  IF THE IRAQIS </p><p>ACTUALLY HAD THE SYSTEM, THEN IT SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY </p><p>STRAIGHTFORWARD TASK TO TURN THE ITEMS OVER. HOWEVER, IF THEY </p><p>DID NOT HAVE THE SYSTEMS, THEY WOULD FACE A FAR MORE </p><p>CHALLENGING TASK IN ASSEMBLING THE DOCUMENTATION PROVING THAT </p><p>THEY DID NOT HAVE, OR NEVER HAD, A PARTICULAR SYSTEM.   BLIX </p><p>SAID THE IRAQIS HAD BEEN "PRO-ACTIVE" IN PROVIDING DOCUMENTS </p><p>RECENTLY ON VX AND ANTHRAX, BUT THAT HE AWAITED UNMOVIC\'S </p><p>ANALYSIS BEFORE PRONOUNCING ON THE PAPERS THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) BLIX NOTED THE CALLS FROM AMERICAN OFFICIALS URGING </p><p>UNMOVIC WITHDRAWAL, AND SAID HE WOULD WAIT FOR THE SYG\'S </p><p>JUDGMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SYG: UN OPERATIONS SUSPENDED; PERSONNEL OUT </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) SYG ANNAN ANNOUNCED THE FOLLOWING DECISIONS: </p><p> </p><p>-- ALL UN HUMANITARIAN PERSONNEL WOULD BE WITHDRAWN FROM </p><p>IRAQ.  (NOTE: WHILE THE SYG DID NOT PROVIDE A TIMELINE, A </p><p>PARTICIPANT IN THE MEETING WHERE THE SYG MADE THE DECISION </p><p>SAID THE UN WAS THINKING IN TERMS OF 24 TO 48 HOURS.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>-- WITHDRAWAL OF UN PERSONNEL FROM IRAQ WOULD INCLUDE </p><p>CONTRACTORS FROM COTECNA AND SAYBOLT (NOTE:  AUTHENTICATORS </p><p>OF OFF DELIVERIES AND OVERSEERS OF OIL LOADINGS, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY. END NOTE.). IN ALL, THE NUMBER OF HUMANITARIAN </p><p>WORKERS WITHDRAWING WOULD TOTAL 195. </p><p> </p><p>-- ANNAN SAID THE WITHDRAWAL OF UN STAFF WOULD LEAD TO THE </p><p>SUSPENSION OF OIL-FOR-FOOD, WHICH COULD NO LONGER OPERATE </p><p>WITHOUT PERSONNEL TO VERIFY OIL LIFTINGS OR OFF DELIVERIES </p><p>AND DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SYG STRESSED THAT UN ACTION ON OFF WAS A SUSPENSION, </p><p>NOT A CANCELLATION, AS THE LATTER WOULD REQUIRE A UNSC </p><p>DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>-- WEAPONS INSPECTIONS WOULD ALSO BE SUSPENDED, WITH 130 </p><p>UNMOVIC AND 5 IAEA INSPECTORS BEING WITHDRAWN. </p><p> </p><p>-- UNIKOM MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL WOULD ALSO BE </p><p>INSTRUCTED TO WITHDRAW (MORE DETAILS SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SYG SAID A LETTER WOULD BE FORTHCOMING TO THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL PRESIDENT, LISTING THESE STEPS AND EXPRESSING THE </p><p>NEED TO CONTINUE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RUSSIA:  MOVE FORWARD PROGRAM OF WORK, </p><p>BUT NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE OFFERED </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) RUSSIAN PERMREP LAVROV EXPLAINED THE PROPOSAL </p><p>CONTAINED IN THE MARCH 15 JOINT RUSSIAN - GERMAN - FRENCH </p><p>DECLARATION.  HE STRESSED THAT THE DOCUMENT COULD "SPEAK FOR </p><p>ITSELF" SINCE INSPECTIONS WERE UNDERWAY AND YIELDING RESULTS. </p><p>IN CONTRAST TO THE AZORES STATEMENTS, RUSSIA "TAKES A </p><p>DIFFERENT APPROACH BASED ON CONCRETE FACTS, THAT INSPECTIONS </p><p>ARE WORKING;"  IRAQ HAD TAKEN POSITIVE STEPS ON THE SUBSTANCE </p><p>OF THE REMAINING DISARMAMENT PROBLEMS.  IN THAT CONTEXT, </p><p>LAVROV LOOKED FORWARD TO RECEIVING THE DRAFT WORK PROGRAM </p><p>LATER TODAY PER BLIX\'S EARLIER PROMISE TO HAVE IT COMPLETED. </p><p>FRANCE, RUSSIA, AND GERMANY ALL BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO </p><p>HOLD A MINISTERIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL TO APPROVE THE WORK </p><p>PROGRAM, AND HE REQUESTED THAT THE COUNCIL SET A DATE SOON SO </p><p>THAT THE MINISTERIAL COULD TAKE PLACE, PREFERABLY EITHER </p><p>TUESDAY AFTERNOON ON WEDNESDAY MORNING, SINCE IT WAS "CLEAR </p><p>WE CAN\'T DELAY." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FRANCE: MORE OF THE SAME, BUT YOU CAN\'T BLAME FRANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) PERMREP DE LA SABLIERE SAID THAT HE HAD A "STRANGE </p><p>FEELING THIS MORNING, WHICH PERHAPS OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS </p><p>SHARED."  HE HAD THOUGHT THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD BE DISCUSSING </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, "TO WHICH ALL ARE </p><p>DEDICATED," BUT "MUCH TO MY SURPRISE," HE HAD LEARNED </p><p>PUBLICLY THAT THE DRAFT RESOLUTION HAD BEEN "WITHDRAWN."  OF </p><p>COURSE, THE CO-SPONSORS COULD DO AS THEY SEE FIT, BUT THE </p><p>COUNCIL SHOULD NOT HAVE LEARNED THAT THE RESOLUTION HAD BEEN </p><p>"WITHDRAWN" OUTSIDE A COUNCIL SETTING.  UNDER THE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, WHEREBY THE INSPECTIONS WERE MAKING PROGRESS </p><p>TOWARDS ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT IN A "LIMITED </p><p>TIMEFRAME," FRANCE COULD NOT SUPPORT A PROPOSAL THAT </p><p>AUTHORIZED USE OF FORCE.  WHILE THE CO-SPONSORS HAD "PUT </p><p>FORTH" THAT A PARTICULAR DELEGATION -- "I BELIEVE MINE" -- </p><p>HAD MADE CLEAR IT WOULD OPPOSE A DRAFT AUTHORIZING THE USE OF </p><p>FORCE, THE DRAFT RESOLUTION WOULD NOT HAVE ACHIEVED A </p><p>MAJORITY VOTE;  WITHOUT A MAJORITY, A "NO" VOTE DID NOT </p><p>CONSTITUTE A "VETO" UNDER THE CHARTER, HE STATED.  THE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS HELD DURING THE LAST WEEK HAD MADE CLEAR THAT THE </p><p>MAJORITY OF COUNCIL MEMBERS COULD NOT SUPPORT A RESOLUTION </p><p>AUTHORIZING THE USE OF FORCE, FOR THEY REMAINED COMMITTED TO </p><p>PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) LA SABLIERE SAID THAT THE COUNCIL WAS COLLECTIVELY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS "BINDING" RESOLUTIONS WHICH COULD LEAD TO </p><p>THE PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ.  THE INSPECTORS WERE </p><p>TELLING THE COUNCIL THAT DISARMAMENT COULD BE ACHIEVED </p><p>PEACEFULLY, HE STRESSED.  HE WAS THUS INTERESTED IN THE DRAFT </p><p>WORK PROGRAM AND KRDTS, WHICH HE BELIEVED SHOULD BE APPROVED </p><p>ON MARCH 19 AT A MINISTERIAL LEVEL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL AS </p><p>A FINAL COUNCIL DISCUSSION.  THERE WAS CONVICTION IN THE </p><p>COUNCIL THAT BENCHMARKS, KRDTS, AND AN INSPECTOR-PROPOSED </p><p>TIMEFRAME OF ONE OR TWO MONTHS COULD PROVIDE A BASIS FOR </p><p>EVALUATION OF THE SITUATION, WITHOUT THE AUTOMATICITY </p><p>"CONTEMPLATED BY SOME, BUT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT FOR THE </p><p>MAJORITY OF DELEGATIONS."  THE USE OF FORCE WITHOUT COUNCIL </p><p>APPROVAL WAS NOT JUSTIFIED, GIVEN PROGRESS MADE IN </p><p>INSPECTIONS, HE REPEATED.  THE COUNCIL COULD CONTINUE TO WORK </p><p>ON THE BASIS "DESIRED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE UN AND THE </p><p>PEOPLES OF THE WORLD."  IN A SEPARATE INTERVENTION, LA </p><p>SABLIERE POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS NOT FOR THE COUNCIL TO </p><p>DECIDE THE WITHDRAWAL OF UN STAFF.  HE PLACED FULL TRUST IN </p><p>THE SYG TO MAKE THE DECISION ON "TEMPORARY" WITHDRAWAL, BUT </p><p>NOTED THAT FRANCE WAS IN FAVOR CONTINUING INSPECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHINA: STILL NEED MAXIMUM EFFORT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) CHINESE PERMREP WANG STATED CHINA BELIEVED THAT AS </p><p>LONG AS THERE WAS ONE PERCENT HOPE, THE COUNCIL SHOULD MAKE </p><p>THE EFFORT TO CONTINUE INSPECTIONS.  WANG SUPPORTED THE </p><p>FRENCH, RUSSIAN, AND GERMAN MARCH 15 JOINT STATEMENT AND </p><p>EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE MARCH 19 MINISTERIAL-LEVEL MEETING </p><p>TO DISCUSS THE INSPECTORS\' WORK PROGRAM.  HE NOTED THE </p><p>"WITHDRAWAL" OF THE CO-SPONSORS DRAFT RESOLUTION, AND </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THIS WAS GOOD IF THE DECISION INDICATED THAT </p><p>THERE WAS HOPE FOR CONSENSUS ON A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.  IF </p><p>THIS DECISION SIGNIFIED A PATH TO WAR, THEN IT WAS "VERY </p><p>REGRETTABLE" BECAUSE CHINA BELIEVED THAT THE REALIZATION OF </p><p>PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT WAS STILL POSSIBLE.  IT WAS IN THE </p><p>INTEREST OF ALL SIDES TO CONTINUE INSPECTIONS AND AVOID WAR. </p><p>ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF UN PERSONNEL FROM IRAQ, CHINA WAS ALSO </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF PERSONNEL, AND RESPECTED THE </p><p>SYG\'S DECISION IN THAT REGARD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GERMANY: ON TO 1284, CONSENSUS NOT EQUAL TO UNANIMITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) GERMAN PERMREP PLEUGER AGREED WITH RUSSIAN PERMREP </p><p>LAVROV\'S STATEMENTS REGARDING THE MARCH 15 JOINT DECLARATION. </p><p>HE STRESSED THAT GERMANY STILL BELIEVED THAT THE COUNCIL </p><p>COULD ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, AND THAT THE </p><p>"VAST MAJORITY OF SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WANTED ANOTHER TRY </p><p>AT ACHIEVING PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT."  CONSENSUS DOES NOT MEAN </p><p>UNANIMITY, HE STATED.  PLEUGER EMPHASIZED THAT HE "COULD NOT </p><p>ACCEPT THAT THE COUNCIL CONSENSUS WAS NOT IN LINE WITH UNSCR </p><p>1441" AS POSITED BY THE CO-SPONSORS.  ALL THOSE THAT WERE </p><p>OPPOSED TO THE DRAFT RESOLUTION "WERE NOT OUTSIDE 1441."  ON </p><p>THE CONTRARY, THESE MEMBERS WANTED PEACE BASED ON UNSCRS 1441 </p><p>AND 1284.  AT THIS POINT, IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE TO SUSPEND </p><p>INSPECTIONS, HE STRESSED.   BLIX HAD PREPARED THE DRAFT WORK </p><p>PROGRAM AND THE KRDTS.  MINISTERS COULD ACHIEVE CONSENSUS BY </p><p>MEETING TO APPROVE THESE PROPOSALS, WHICH WERE "NOT THAT </p><p>DIFFERENT" FROM THE UK BENCHMARKS.  THE SYG WAS RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE SECURITY OF UN STAFF; THEREFORE, GERMANY WOULD </p><p>SUPPORT ANY DECISION HE MADE ON UN WITHDRAWAL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN:  1441 IN ENTIRETY, CAN\'T BE SELECTIVE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS CONCURRED WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p>GREENSTOCK THAT THE CO-SPONSORS WOULD NOT PROCEED WITH THE </p><p>VOTE ON THE RESOLUTION.  BASED ON UNSCR 1441, READ AS A </p><p>WHOLE, SPAIN HAD NOTED THAT IRAQ WAS IN MATERIAL BREACH. </p><p>SOME MEMBERS HAD NOT READ UNSCR 1441 AS A WHOLE, BUT HAD A </p><p>TENDENCY TO OMIT CERTAIN POINTS, FOR EXAMPLE, "ANY OMISSION </p><p>OR FALSEHOOD" OR "NOT FULL COOPERATION" WOULD RESULT IN A </p><p>MATERIAL BREACH.  COUNCIL MEMBERS WERE PURSUING A DIFFICULT </p><p>PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE WITHOUT MILITARY PRESSURE, THE INSPECTORS </p><p>WOULD NOT BE IN IRAQ.  MERE LANGUAGE WOULD NOT FUNCTION </p><p>WITHOUT AN ULTIMATUM.  LA SABLIERE SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>CO-SPONSORS DID NOT HAVE THE MAJORITY OF VOTES.  BUT WHETHER </p><p>OR NOT THIS WAS THE CASE, THE FRENCH DELEGATION SAID IT WOULD </p><p>VETO, AND THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BULGARIA: SAD DAY FOR THE COUNCIL </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) BULGARIAN PERMREP TAFROV STATED THAT IT WAS A "SAD </p><p>DAY FOR THE UN AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL, SAD THAT IT WAS </p><p>CLEARER THAN EVER THAT SECURITY COUNCIL DIVISIONS OVER THE </p><p>IRAQ CRISIS WERE INSURMOUNTABLE." BULGARIA HAD ADVOCATED </p><p>COUNCIL UNITY AND WAS CONCERNED OVER THE TREND IN THE COUNCIL </p><p>TOWARD TWO RIGID POSITIONS ON IRAQ.  THIS SPLIT SHOULD NOT </p><p>HAVE DIVIDED THE COUNCIL ON ITS COMMON GOAL OF DISARMAMENT. </p><p>BULGARIA SUPPORTED THE UK PROPOSAL, BELIEVING THAT IT </p><p>PROVIDED THE NECESSARY ELEMENTS OF COMPROMISE FOR COUNCIL </p><p>UNITY.  CERTAIN DELEGATIONS REJECTED THE PROPOSAL.  THE </p><p>DIVISIONS IN THE COUNCIL LIKELY WOULD REMAIN FOR DAYS AND </p><p>EVEN WEEKS, BUT COUNCIL MEMBERS SHOULD NOT RESORT TO "MUTUAL </p><p>RECRIMINATION."  DIFFERENCES IN THE COUNCIL WERE NOT </p><p>"INSURMOUNTABLE," AS LONG AS COUNCIL MEMBERS HAD THE </p><p>POLITICAL DETERMINATION TO TAKE "ONE LAST STEP."  IN THE </p><p>FINAL ANALYSIS, BULGARIA WAS OPEN TO ANY PROPOSAL THAT COULD </p><p>RESTORE COUNCIL UNITY. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) FOR THE MOMENT, THE COUNCIL SHOULD FOCUS ON THE MAIN </p><p>ISSUE OF THE FUTURE OF THE UN AS AN "ESSENTIAL INSTITUTION </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND THE VERY INCARNATION OF THE </p><p>PRINCIPLE OF MULTILATERALISM IN WORLD AFFAIRS."  IT WAS </p><p>CRITICAL FOR THE COUNCIL TO RESTORE ITS CENTRAL ROLE ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF IRAQ, AND CONTINUE DIALOGUE.  THE COUNCIL, HOWEVER, </p><p>NEEDED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND </p><p>WITH REGARD TO THE SAFETY OF UN PERSONNEL.  BULGARIA WOULD </p><p>HEED ADVICE ON UN WITHDRAWAL FROM THE SYG AND THE CHIEF </p><p>INSPECTOR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAKISTAN: THE ART OF SAYING LITTLE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (C)  IN WHAT HAS BECOME TYPICAL OF HIS INTERVENTIONS IN </p><p>THE COUNCIL ON THE SUBJECT OF IRAQ, PAKISTANI PERMREP AKRAM </p><p>CAUTIOUSLY AVOIDED MAKING CHOOSING SIDES IN THE DEBATE, </p><p>SAYING IT WAS CLEAR THE COUNCIL WAS AT AN IMPASSE.  PAKISTAN </p><p>HAD SOUGHT "FULL AND FAITHFUL" IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCRS AS </p><p>THE SOLUTION TO IRAQ\'S WMD, AND WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO. </p><p>DISARMAMENT BY PEACEFUL MEANS HAD ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG </p><p>PREFERENCE.  PAKISTAN HAVE ALSO BELIEVED IN THE UNITY OF THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL IN ACHIEVING THESE OBJECTIVES, BUT </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY THE COUNCIL HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND </p><p>CONVERGENCE IN ANY OF THE PROPOSALS WHICH HAD BEEN TABLED BY </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.  THAT SAID, PAKISTAN BELIEVED THAT </p><p>TIME AND SPACE FOR DIPLOMACY DID NOT END, AND DIPLOMATIC </p><p>OPTIONS MUST CONTINUE TO BE EXPLORED IN ORDER TO FIND A </p><p>UNITED STAND.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD RECEIVE THE PROGRAM OF WORK </p><p>WHILE CONTINUING TO URGE A RESPONSE FROM THE IRAQI </p><p>AUTHORITIES EVEN AT THIS LATE DATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHILE, MEXICO: (TYPICALLY OF LATE) UNHELPFUL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) CHILEAN PERMREP VALDES AGREED THAT IT WAS A SAD DAY </p><p>FOR THE UNITED NATIONS, "GIVEN THAT THE INSPECTIONS ARE </p><p>STRENGTHENED AND MORE EFFECTIVE DAILY... THEY COULD HAVE </p><p>ACHIEVED THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, AND CHANGED THE DYNAMIC </p><p>THERE," WHICH HE ASSERTED WOULD HAVE LED TO GREATER DEMOCRACY </p><p>IN IRAQ.  CHILE REGRETTED THAT ITS PROPOSAL TO BRIDGE </p><p>DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE P-5 HAD BEEN REJECTED BEFORE IT WAS </p><p>FULLY CIRCULATED FOR CONSIDERATION.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>NEED TO "MAINTAIN A CONSTRUCTIVE CLIMATE" IN THE COUNCIL, HE </p><p>WARNED MEMBERS AGAINST RECRIMINATIONS.  CHILE SUPPORTED THE </p><p>PRESENTATION OF THE PROGRAM OF WORK, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS "NO </p><p>REASON" TO IGNORE THE SERIOUS SITUATION ON THE SECURITY OF </p><p>IRAQ AND THE SYG\'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW UN PERSONNEL. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) MEXICAN PERMREP AGUILAR-ZINSER MADE A </p><p>CHARACTERISTICALLY LONG INTERVENTION, ECHOING PREVIOUS POINTS </p><p>MADE IN THE COUNCIL, OUTLINING MEXICO\'S INTERPRETATION OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE UN CHARTER.  HE REGRETTED THAT </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN NO UNANIMOUS DECISION WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED </p><p>THE COUNCIL TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, AND, </p><p>RECALLING 1441, REGRETTED THAT THE CONCLUSION HAD NOT BEEN TO </p><p>SEEK A UNANIMOUS DECISION ON PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT.  MEXICO </p><p>HAD CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORTH BY THE U.S., </p><p>UK AND SPAIN AS CO-SPONSORS OF THE DRAFT RESOLUTION. </p><p>FURTHER, MEXICO SHARED BILATERAL COMMITMENTS THAT RELATED TO </p><p>COMMON SECURITY "WITH ONE CO-SPONSOR WITH WHOM WE SHARE </p><p>GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY AND POLICY GOALS;"  MEXICO WOULD </p><p>DEFEND THE IMMEDIATE SPHERE OF SECURITY TOGETHER WITH THAT </p><p>PARTNER. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) WITH RESPECT TO THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, HOWEVER, </p><p>MEXICO BASED ITS POSITION ON THE CONVICTION THAT ACTION </p><p>SHOULD BE TAKEN WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK WITH FULL </p><p>AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE.   WHILE MEXICO HAD NEITHER </p><p>"ARSENALS NOR STRATEGIC PROJECTS NOR FINANCIAL INTERESTS </p><p>GLOBALLY," ITS EXTERNAL POLICIES WERE FOUNDED ON THEIR </p><p>CONSTITUTION WHICH REGULATED ITS BEHAVIOR.  PRESIDENT FOX HAD </p><p>SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED HIS FOREIGN MINISTER AND PERMREP TO </p><p>ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MEXICAN </p><p>CONSTITUTION:  ONE REQUIRED PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT WITH FORCE </p><p>ONLY BROUGHT AT THE FINAL MOMENT, AND ANOTHER REQUIRED THAT </p><p>THE THREAT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AS SUCH BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>"AS THE SOLE BODY AUTHORIZED TO DECLARE THE USE OF SUCH </p><p>FORCE."  HOPE WAS NOT YET EXHAUSTED, AND THUS "THERE WAS NO </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF FORCE IN DISARMING IRAQ."  THE </p><p>PRECEPTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE UN CHARTER SET FORTH </p><p>THE CONDITIONS FOR USE OF FORCE; MEXICO DID NOT SEE THAT </p><p>THOSE CONDITIONS HAD BEEN MET. THE SECURITY COUNCIL CANNOT </p><p>RELINQUISH AUTHORITY HERE, FOR MAJORITIES -- WHETHER OR NOT </p><p>UNANIMOUS -- ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF COLLECTIVE WILL. </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN MUST DISARM, MUST ABIDE BY THE RELEVANT </p><p>UNSCRS, AND CANNOT THREATEN INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. </p><p> IN THAT CONTEXT, MEXICO SUPPORTED THE DRAFT PROGRAM OF WORK, </p><p>WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A STANDARD TO DISARMAMENT EFFORTS, HE </p><p>CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANGOLA, CAMEROON, GUINEA: REGRETFUL, </p><p>BUT STILL TINGED WITH HOPE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) ANGOLAN PERMREP GASPAR-MARTINS SAID THAT THE BLIX AND </p><p>EL-BARADEI REPORTS TO THE COUNCIL HAD MADE CLEAR THAT </p><p>INSPECTIONS WERE PRODUCING SOME RESULTS IN THE ATTEMPT TO </p><p>DISARM IRAQ, BUT THOSE RESULTS WERE NOT SATISFACTORY TO EVERY </p><p>MEMBER.  ALTHOUGH ALL PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS HAD TO BE EXHAUSTED </p><p>BEFORE MOVING TO WAR, THAT SEEMED TO BE THE SITUATION FACING </p><p>THE COUNCIL.  IN THAT CONTEXT, HE PAID TRIBUTE TO THE MOST </p><p>RECENT UK EFFORT, BUT "EVEN THAT" DID NOT WORK.  WAR CAUSED </p><p>UNTOLD SUFFERING, AND IF THE COUNCIL COULD AVOID A DECISION </p><p>HAVING TO UPHOLD WAR, IT SHOULD DO SO.  ON A PRACTICAL NOTE, </p><p>GASPAR-MARTINS SUGGESTED THAT SOME TIME SHOULD ELAPSE BEFORE </p><p>HOLDING ANOTHER MINISTERIAL MEETING, "TO LET THINGS CALM </p><p>DOWN."  IF GOVERNMENTS MIGHT BE CONVINCED OF MOVING FORWARD </p><p>ON THE DRAFT PROGRAM OF WORK WITH THE FULL COMMITMENT OF THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL, HOWEVER, THEN THE ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO </p><p>DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) CAMEROONIAN PERMREP BELINGA-EBOUTOU AGREED THAT THE </p><p>COUNCIL WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LIMITS OF DIPLOMACY IN </p><p>MANAGING THE IRAQI CRISIS.  DESPITE THE DRAMATIC EVENTS OF </p><p>THE PREVIOUS 48 HOURS IN THE CAR, THE COUNCIL HAD NOT </p><p>REGISTERED THAT CRISIS; THIS SIMPLE FACT SUPPORTED HIS </p><p>ASSERTION.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE COUNCIL\'S DISUNITY WAS A </p><p>"DISSERVICE TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND MULTILATERALISM," AND </p><p>APPEALED FOR THE P-5 TO CAUCUS AND SORT OUT THEIR </p><p>DIFFERENCES.  THE SIX HAD PROPOSED ELEMENTS FOR A </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT THAT HAD BEEN REJECTED, BUT WHICH </p><p>REMAINED ON THE TABLE.  HE CONCLUDED THAT "A MIRACLE" COULD </p><p>NOT YET BE RULED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) GUINEAN PERMREP TRAORE, COUNCIL PRESIDENT FOR MARCH, </p><p>SAID THAT GUINEA HAD SPARED NO EFFORT TO FIND A COMPROMISE </p><p>THAT WOULD BE HEAL THE DEADLOCK IN THE COUNCIL.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>FRENCH - GERMAN - RUSSIAN DECLARATION OF MARCH 15 AND THE </p><p>AZORES SUMMIT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE COUNCIL WAS "MORE DIVIDED </p><p>THAN EVER."  ALL WILL LOSE WITHOUT SOME COMPROMISE, HE </p><p>WARNED; HE HOPED SOME COMPROMISE SOLUTION COULD STILL BE </p><p>FOUND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA: DEADLOCK </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) SYRIAN PERMREP WEHBE SAID THAT THE COUNCIL HAD "TRULY </p><p>REACHED A STATE OF COMPLETE DETERIORATION OF THE SITUATION IN </p><p>IRAQ," WITH THE U.S. INFORMING UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA TO </p><p>EVACUATE, THE INSPECTORS\' WITHDRAWAL, AND THE STATEMENTS MADE </p><p>IN THE AZORES.  THE COUNCIL HAD REACHED DEADLOCK, BUT THERE </p><p>WAS STILL ANOTHER COURSE: THE PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ. </p><p>THE COUNCIL AGREED UNDER UNSCR 1441 THAT THE AIMS OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD BE TO ACHIEVE PEACEFUL </p><p>DISARMAMENT.  UNSCRS 1284 AND 1441 ESTABLISHED UNMOVIC AND </p><p>REINFORCED THE INSPECTIONS SYSTEM.  IRAQ WAS COOPERATING ON </p><p>PROCEDURE AND SUBSTANCE; IT MADE POSITIVE EFFORTS TO DESTROY </p><p>WEAPONS, AND HAD PRODUCED REPORTS ON ANTHRAX AND VX.  NOW THE </p><p>COUNCIL HAD "GREATER DETERMINATION AND JUSTIFICATION FOR WORK </p><p>UNDER 1441" AND CONTINUED COUNCIL UNITY BECAUSE THE </p><p>INSPECTORS WERE READY TO PRESENT A WORK PROGRAM AND KRDTS. </p><p>WEHBE SUPPORTED LAVROV\'S PROPOSAL TO HEAR THE WORK PROGRAM ON </p><p>MARCH 19 TO "LEAD TOWARDS ADDITIONAL PEACEFUL ACTION." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEGROPONTE </p><p></p></div>
