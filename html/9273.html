<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001676 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, PTER, YM, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: ONE STEP FORWARD FOR ADEN SHIPPING INDUSTRY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) SANAA 1155 B) SANAA 505 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by A/DCM S. Alexander for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Deputy Minister of Finance Ahmed Ghaleb confirmed to </p><p>Pol/econoff on July 9 that the ROYG had placed fifty million </p><p>USD in an escrow account at HSBC in accordance with the </p><p>January agreement with Lloyds\' to lower transshipment </p><p>insurance rates for Yemen (Reftel A). However, Ghaleb added, </p><p>the insurance rates have not yet been lowered because the </p><p>underwriters still are not satisfied with some of the </p><p>technical details of the escrow account. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment: Embassy worked directly and with the donor </p><p>community to put pressure on the ROYG to fulfill its terms of </p><p>the deal. That, along with a June 10 Financial Times article </p><p>criticizing the ROYG\'s handling of the matter, finally moved </p><p>the ROYG to fulfill the terms of the agreement.  While this </p><p>is a positive step for the shipping industry, as Reftel A </p><p>points out, HSBC was originally not on the approved list of </p><p>banks by Lloyds. The choice of HSBC by the ROYG suggests that </p><p>continued political maneuvering may still be negatively </p><p>affecting the return of shipping to Aden. End Comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
