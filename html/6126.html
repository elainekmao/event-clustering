<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001410 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: ERDOGAN AND AK LOOKING GOOD IN SIIRT </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass. Reason: 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Contacts across the political spectrum indicate AK and </p><p>its party leader Erdogan are  poised to win the March 9 </p><p>special election in Siirt province, paving the way Erdogan\'s </p><p>entry into Parliament and eventual move to the Prime Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- AK M. P. Egemen Bagis told us March 4 that 16 AK deputies </p><p>now in Siirt are lobbying hard on Erdogan\'s behalf and are </p><p>confident the party will sweep Siirt\'s three seats in the </p><p>legislature.  AK Vice Chairman Dengir Firat and M.P. Ihsan </p><p>Arslan are among the high-profile figures representing </p><p>Erdogan in Siirt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Meanwhile, opposition CHP deputies Bulent Tanla and Emin </p><p>Koc tell us that their party is resigned to the possibility </p><p>of an AK sweep, but they hold out hope that they could </p><p>capture one seat.  CHP is maintaining its own 10-man team in </p><p>the province, rotating fresh shifts on a daily basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to pro-Kurdish HADEP Chairman Ahmet Turan </p><p>Demir, AK\'s overwhelming advantage in financial resources </p><p>guarantees that AK will win at least one seat.  Demir </p><p>explained to us March 4 that during the run-up to the </p><p>election, AK\'s campaign strategy has emphasized that: 1) </p><p>electing the future P.M. is an honor; 2) the P.M. will bring </p><p>tangible economic benefits to the province; and 3) Erdogan\'s </p><p>wife is from Siirt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Both CHP and HADEP officials separately denied to us </p><p>rumors that they are cooperating against AK in Siirt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Our CHP contacts admit that they considered the idea </p><p>briefly but abandoned it.  They say they want Erdogan to </p><p>become P.M., so that he can assume more responsibility for </p><p>AK\'s policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Demir averred that HADEP voters are likely to stay home to </p><p>protest what HADEP claims was AK\'s "illegal" petition to have </p><p>the Nov. 3 election results in Siirt nullified, thereby </p><p>setting up the March 9 denouement.  He charged that CHP is </p><p>"far worse than AK" because it supports Turkish military </p><p>repression in predominantly Kurdish Southeastern Turkey. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
