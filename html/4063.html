BRENT HARDT FOR REASON 1.5(B) AND ( </p><p>D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH MEETS WITH CHINESE </p><p>PRESIDENT JIANG OCTOBER 24 IN CRAWFORD, THE HOLY SEE WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05194  231549Z </p><p>WELCOME A CONTINUED STRONG PRESIDENTIAL PUSH FOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM IN CHINA, REINFORCING THE MESSAGE THE PRESIDENT </p><p>DELIVERED IN HIS LAST MEETING WITH JIANG.  HOLY SEE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN TOLD CHARGE OCTOBER 22 </p><p>THAT THE HOLY SEE GREATLY APPRECIATED THE PRESIDENT\'S EFFORTS </p><p>ON BEHALF OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE POSITION OF THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH IN HIS LAST MEETING, AND BELIEVES A </p><p>REITERATION OF THE SAME POINTS AT THIS TIME WOULD BE HELPFUL. </p><p> AT THE SAME TIME, THE HOLY SEE IS NOT CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>TIMING IS PROPITIOUS TO PRESS TOO HARD FOR SPECIFIC </p><p>CONCESSIONS FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PRIOR TO THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS, AS JIANG MAY BE LESS RECEPTIVE NOW THAN AFTER </p><p>THE CONGRESS.  RATHER, THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES IT WOULD BE </p><p>USEFUL FOR PRESIDENT BUSH TO INSIST ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR </p><p>ALL FAITHS IN CHINA AND TO CONVEY THAT THE UNITED STATES </p><p>WOULD WELCOME NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE HOLY </p><p>SEE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ACCORDING TO FM TAURAN AND VATICAN CHINA DESK OFFICER </p><p>ROTA-GRAZIOSI, THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH </p><p>IN CHINA WILL BENEFIT MOST THROUGH THE UNIVERSAL ADVANCEMENT </p><p>OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CHINA.  THE HOLY SEE WOULD WELCOME </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S AFFIRMATION OF UNITED STATES\' SUPPORT FOR </p><p>NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND CHINA AND </p><p>FOR CHINESE GOODWILL GESTURES TOWARD THE CHURCH.  SUCH </p><p>GESTURES COULD INCLUDE PERMISSION FOR A SENIOR HOLY SEE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TO VISIT A LOCAL CHINESE CHURCH OR AN EASING </p><p>OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE MANY BISHOPS AND PRIESTS BEING </p><p>HELD IN POLICE CUSTODY, HOUSE ARREST OR UNDER HEAVY </p><p>SURVEILLANCE.  OVER THE LONGER TERM, THE HOLY SEE WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO SEE CHINESE AUTHORITIES PERMIT THE ORDINATION OF CHINESE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05194  231549Z </p><p>BISHOPS AND PRIESTS BY THE POPE AS WELL AS THE PILGRIMAGES </p><p>AND OTHER VISITS OF CATHOLIC AUTHORITIES TO THE HOLY SEE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE KEY TO SINO-VATICAN RELATIONS AT THIS JUNCTURE, </p><p>THEY BELIEVE, IS FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO BETTER </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE SPECIFIC LINK BETWEEN CATHOLICS </p><p>AND THE HOLY SEE.  ACCORDING TO ROTA-GRAZIOZI, THE CHINESE </p><p>REMAIN GRIPPED WITH FEAR THAT CATHOLIC CHURCH MEMBERSHIP </p><p>WOULD THREATEN CHINESE CIVIL POWER.  HE BELIEVED SUCH FEARS </p><p>COULD BE ALLAYED IF THE CHINESE BETTER UNDERSTOOD THAT </p><p>CATHOLIC FAITHFUL DO NOT ALWAYS FOLLOW THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>POSITIONS ON INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL ISSUES AND THAT PAPAL </p><p>AUTHORITY IS A SPIRITUAL, NOT POLITICAL, MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: NOT PASSED TO ABOVE ADDRESSEE(S) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05194 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
