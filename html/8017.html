<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001349 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, CA, UNSC, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN SUPPORT FOR LIFTING OF IRAQ SANCTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 122029 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) We conveyed points contained reftel on May 9 to Don </p><p>Sinclair, Director General of DFAIT\'s Middle East and North </p><p>Africa Bureau. Sinclair said Canada welcomed the news that </p><p>the resolution to lift sanctions against Iraq had been </p><p>introduced in the UN Security Council.  He indicated that </p><p>Canada, though not a UNSC member, would support the effort. </p><p>Sinclair said that Canadian officials would seek public </p><p>opportunities to express their backing, but that DFAIT would </p><p>probably not issue a separate press release. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Sinclair said that now is the right time to begin the </p><p>normalization process and described the U.S. approach to the </p><p>wide range of issues surrounding Iraq as "practical, </p><p>flexible, and pragmatic."  He emphasized it is important to </p><p>Canada that the UN play a meaningful role in the process. </p><p>With respect to the steps proposed in the resolution, he </p><p>commented that the "devil is in the details."  If the current </p><p>sanctions regime is lifted, Sinclair asked, would another set </p><p>of sanctions or restrictions (on weapons procurement, for </p><p>example) take its place, or would all sanctions against Iraq </p><p>be ended? </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Sinclair raised several concerns/questions regarding </p><p>the U.S. proposals.  What about Iraqi creditors, particularly </p><p>Russia, China, and France, who would apparently be asked to </p><p>agree to the freezing of debt repayment obligations?  He </p><p>noted that the whole issue of letting the Iraqis determine </p><p>their own future would be a major test.  Would the coalition </p><p>partners accept unconditionally the final results of an Iraqi </p><p>election?  He asked about the future role of UN weapons </p><p>inspectors in Iraq; Canada felt it was important to </p><p>reintroduce them into the mix. UNMOVIC had credibility with </p><p>the international community and would lend greater trust to </p><p>the final certification that Iraq was free of weapons of mass </p><p>destruction. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  These were just his preliminary reactions, he </p><p>emphasized, to what Canada saw as a positive step in getting </p><p>the post conflict phase of Iraqi reconstruction under way. </p><p>Canada looked forward to further elaboration of coalition </p><p>plans and strategies. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
