<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BEIJING 012362 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/29/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: HU JINTAO: TAKING SHAPE AS CHINA\'S LEADER </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) BEIJING 11318, B) STATE 194582 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JON </p><p>ALOISI.  REASON 1.5 (B) (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) MOST CHINESE HAVE LITTLE IDEA OF HEIR-APPARENT </p><p>HU JINTAO\'S PERSONAL VIEWS, BUT INSIDERS DESCRIBE HU AS </p><p>A TALENTED BUREAUCRATIC PLAYER WITH SOLID CREDENTIALS TO </p><p>SUCCEED JIANG ZEMIN.  THEY REPORT THAT HU HAS STAKED OUT </p><p>A MULTI-FACETED AND SUBSTANTIVE POLICY ROLE IN IMPORTANT </p><p>AREAS OF PARTY AND GOVERNMENT WORK.  A MASTER AT </p><p>NETWORKING, HU MAINTAINS PERSONAL TIES THAT HAVE ALREADY </p><p>HELPED HIM STAVE OFF THREATS TO HIS ADVANCEMENT, WHILE </p><p>EARNING "CHITS" FROM JIANG ZEMIN THAT WILL HELP ENSURE </p><p>JIANG DOES NOT ACT AGAINST HIS INTERESTS IN THE </p><p>COMING MONTHS.  CHINESE POINT TO HU\'S CLOSE ASSOCIATION </p><p>WITH HU YAOBANG, AND HIS CURRENT ROLE IN ENLIVENING THE </p><p>CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL, AS EVIDENCE THAT HU MAY WELL </p><p>PURSUE A REFORMIST AGENDA AFTER TAKING THE REINS OF </p><p>PARTY AND STATE OVER THE NEXT 15 MONTHS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>HU TAKES ON A HUMAN FACE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) HU JINTAO HAS LONG BEEN THE LEAST VISIBLE MEMBER </p><p>OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S </p><p>POLITBURO.  MOST OBSERVERS EXPLAIN THIS AS A CALCULATED </p><p>RESULT OF BUREAUCRATIC CAUTION.  AS DENG\'S SELECTION AS </p><p>THE "FOURTH-GENERATION" SUCCESSOR, HE IS A NATURAL </p><p>TARGET FOR THE JEALOUS AND AMBITIOUS.  WITH HIS OCTOBER </p><p>28-NOVEMBER 12 VISIT TO RUSSIA, BRITAIN, FRANCE, SPAIN </p><p>AND GERMANY (REF A), HOWEVER, HU MADE HIS MOST PROLONGED </p><p>AND PUBLIC APPEARANCE TO DATE -- AND MADE OFFICIAL THE </p><p>UNDERSTANDING THAT HE IS DESTINED TO BECOME THE "CORE" </p><p>OF CHINA\'S FOURTH-GENERATION LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CHINESE SOURCES AND OUR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS </p><p>ALIKE AGREE THAT THE "MYSTERIOUS" HU IS, IN FACT, AN </p><p>APPROACHABLE, LIKEABLE LEADER WITHOUT PRETENSIONS WHO </p><p>TALKS AS EASILY WITH STAFFERS AS HE DOES WITH THEIR </p><p>BOSSES.  ACCORDING TO BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH DIPLOMATS, </p><p>HU WAS CONSTANTLY ENGAGED THROUGHOUT HIS TRIP, ASKING </p><p>THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES.  HE </p><p>REPORTEDLY DISPLAYED A REMARKABLE MEMORY THAT ALLOWED </p><p>HIM TO MAKE ALL HIS SPEECHES WITHOUT CUE CARDS. </p><p>EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS ALSO NOTED HIS ANALYTICAL ABILITY AND </p><p>COMMAND OF DETAIL, PARTICULARLY ON ECONOMIC MATTERS.  ON </p><p>A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL, THE BRITISH FLATLY DENIED REPORTS </p><p>THAT HU COULD SPEAK ENGLISH, ALTHOUGH HE APPARENTLY HAS </p><p>A LIMITED ENGLISH READING CAPABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>HU\'S RELATIONS WITH JIANG </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MOST CHINESE CONTACTS AGREE THAT JIANG ACCEPTS </p><p>HU AS HIS SUCCESSOR, DESPITE OCCASIONAL FOREIGN MEDIA </p><p>REPORTS TO THE CONTRARY.  SOURCES HAVE POINTED OUT THAT, </p><p>SINCE 1992, JIANG HAS GRADUALLY GIVEN HU INCREASING </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY IN ORDER TO PREPARE HIM TO ASSUME JIANG\'S </p><p>POSITIONS.  HU WAS IN SUCCESSION MADE CENTRAL PARTY </p><p>SCHOOL PRESIDENT (1993), HEAD OF THE CENTRAL LEADING </p><p>GROUP FOR PARTY-BUILDING WORK (1994), STATE VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT (1998), AND VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE CCP\'S CENTRAL </p><p>MILITARY COMMISSION (1999).  HE HAS ALSO BEEN GIVEN </p><p>POLICY LEADERSHIP OVER ISSUES AS DIVERSE AS THE </p><p>MILITARY\'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, PLANNING </p><p>FOR THE 16TH PARTY CONGRESS AND, MOST RECENTLY </p><p>(ACCORDING TO WHAT HU TOLD BRITISH PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BLAIR), AFGHANISTAN.  IN ADDITION, HU HAS HELD IMPORTANT </p><p>POSITIONS IN PROVINCIAL CAPITALS.  IN SUM, JIANG HAS </p><p>ENSURED THAT HU HAS THE BROADEST BASE OF EXPERIENCE OF </p><p>ANY MEMBER OF THE FOURTH GENERATION; THIS, IN TURN, HAS </p><p>BOLSTERED HU\'S POSITION AS THE INDIVIDUAL MOST CAPABLE </p><p>OF SERVING AS THE NEXT LEADERSHIP\'S CORE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AS JIANG\'S SUCCESSOR-IN-WAITING, HU HAS LOYALLY </p><p>CARRIED OUT HIS DUTIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, HU HEADED THE 1995 </p><p>"CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION" OF THEN-BEIJING PARTY </p><p>SECRETARY CHEN XITONG, ONE OF JIANG\'S STRONGEST </p><p>POLITICAL OPPONENTS.  IN DOING SO, HE REPORTEDLY </p><p>PROTECTED MEMBERS OF DENG XIAOPING\'S FAMILY WHO MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN INVOLVED IN WRONGDOING, AND PERSUADED JIANG TO </p><p>REPLACE CHEN WITH THE MORE "NEUTRAL" WEI JIANXING, </p><p>RATHER THAN WITH HUANG JU OR ANOTHER MEMBER OF JIANG\'S </p><p>SHANGHAI FACTION.  HU ALSO PROVED HIS LOYALTY TO JIANG </p><p>BY NOT OPPOSING THE GENERAL SECRETARY\'S MOVE TO FORCE </p><p>QIAO SHI\'S RETIREMENT FROM THE CCP\'S STANDING COMMITTEE </p><p>DURING THE 1997 15TH PARTY CONGRESS -- DESPITE THE FACT </p><p>THAT QIAO WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INFLUENCES IN </p><p>HU\'S METEORIC RISE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) A VICE-MINISTERIAL-RANK OFFICIAL CURRENTLY </p><p>STUDYING AT THE CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL AND KNOWS HU </p><p>PERSONALLY REPORTS AN "ANHUI ANGLE" TO THE HU </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH JIANG (AND ZHU RONGJI).  THIS SOURCE </p><p>RELATED THAT HU, JIANG AND ZHU COMMONLY -- AND PUBLICLY </p><p>-- JOKED THAT THEY WERE AN "ANHUI TRIO."  HU\'S FAMILY </p><p>WAS FROM THE SOUTHERN CITY OF JIXI, ZHU\'S WAS ORIGINALLY </p><p>FROM NORTHERN ANHUI, WHILE JIANG\'S GRANDPARENTS </p><p>REPORTEDLY MIGRATED TO YANGZHOU (JIANGSU PROVINCE) FROM </p><p>EASTERN ANHUI.  DESPITE HIS ANHUI ROOTS, "CHAIRMAN JIANG </p><p>ALWAYS PUTS DOWN \'YANGZHOU\' AS HIS HOMETOWN ON HIS PARTY </p><p>PERSONNEL DOCUMENTS, BUT HU JINTAO PROUDLY LISTS HIMSELF </p><p>AS A PERSON FROM JIXI."  THIS CONTACT ALSO ASSERTED THAT </p><p>HU WAS A DISTANT RELATIVE OF FAMED CHINESE INTELLECTUAL </p><p>HU SHI. </p><p> </p><p>A MASTER NETWORKER... </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) HU HAS SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING A SERIES OF </p><p>RELATIONSHIP NETWORKS WHICH HAVE MADE HIM A PLAYER IN </p><p>HIS OWN RIGHT WITHIN THE PARTY\'S TOP HIERARCHY.  THESE </p><p>NETWORKS INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE QINGHUA CLIQUE.  HU STUDIED AT QINGHUA, CHINA\'S </p><p>PREMIER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY, BETWEEN 1959 </p><p>AND 1964.  QINGHUA HAS LONG TAKEN PRIDE IN DEVELOPING </p><p>STUDENTS WHO ARE BOTH TECHNICALLY EXPERT AND </p><p>IDEOLOGICALLY "RED" BY SELECTING PARTICULARLY PROMISING </p><p>STUDENTS TO BECOME UNDERGRADUATE "POLITICAL ADVISORS." </p><p>HU WAS SUCH AN ADVISOR AND, UPON GRADUATING, STAYED ON </p><p>FOR THREE MORE YEARS AS A POLITICAL INSTRUCTOR.  WELL- </p><p>INFORMED CHINESE SOURCES CONFIRMED THAT, IN THESE </p><p>POSITIONS, HU CAME TO KNOW MOST OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES AT </p><p>QINGHUA WELL, INCLUDING CURRENT MINISTER OF JUSTICE </p><p>ZHANG FUSEN, CCP UNITED FRONT WORK DEPARTMENT DEPUTY LIU </p><p>YANDONG, MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY JIA CHUNWANG, AND </p><p>SHAANXI PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARY TIAN CHENGPING. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE GANSU FACTION.  IN 1968, HU ESCAPED THE WORST OF </p><p>THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION BY VOLUNTEERING TO "GO DOWN" TO </p><p>GANSU PROVINCE, WHERE HE SERVED ON CONSTRUCTION TEAMS. </p><p>HU WAS PROMOTED RAPIDLY THROUGH THE RANKS UNTIL HE CAME </p><p>TO THE ATTENTION OF PARTY SECRETARY SONG PING.  HU ALSO </p><p>MET OTHER MEMBERS OF SONG PING\'S "GANSU FACTION," </p><p>INCLUDING CURRENT VICE PREMIER (AND PREMIER ZHU RONGJI\'S </p><p>PROBABLE SUCCESSOR) WEN JIABAO AND MINISTER OF </p><p>SUPERVISION ZHANG XUEZHONG.  SONG PING WAS INSTRUMENTAL </p><p>IN HU\'S INTRODUCTION TO HU YAOBANG AND HIS 1992 </p><p>PROMOTION TO THE POLITBURO\'S STANDING COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE COMMUNIST YOUTH LEAGUE (CYL).  THE CYL IS LIKE A </p><p>MINIATURE COMMUNIST PARTY WITH A NATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT </p><p>MIMICS THE CCP\'S OWN ORGANIZATION.  IT HAS BEEN A </p><p>SPRINGBOARD TO PROMOTION FOR LEADERS, SUCH AS HU </p><p>YAOBANG, WHO SUBSEQUENTLY ROSE TO SENIOR POSITIONS. </p><p>HU\'S CONTACTS FROM HIS YEARS AS CYL PRINCIPAL DEPUTY </p><p>(1982-1984) AND FIRST SECRETARY (1984-1985) INCLUDED: </p><p>HENAN GOVERNOR (AND ONE OF HU\'S CLOSEST PERSONAL </p><p>FRIENDS) LI KEQIANG, FUJIAN PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARY </p><p>(AND ANOTHER CLOSE FRIEND) SONG DEFU, MINISTER OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY JIA CHUNWANG, STATE COUNCIL NATIONALITIES </p><p>AFFAIRS\' COMMISSION CHAIRMAN LI DEZHU, AND XINJIANG </p><p>PARTY SECRETARY WANG LEQUAN.  HU YAOBANG, WHO WAS </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY WHILE HU WAS AT THE CYL, SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>INTRODUCED HU TO QIAO SHI.  QIAO, IN TURN, LIKE SONG </p><p>PING, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GIVING HU\'S CAREER A NUMBER OF </p><p>BOOSTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) SUCH NETWORKS ARE NOT UNUSUAL IN RELATIONSHIP- </p><p>ORIENTED CHINA AND, INDEED, MOST PARTY MEMBERS NEED </p><p>THESE NETWORKS FOR POLITICAL SURVIVAL AND ADVANCEMENT. </p><p>WHAT IS UNUSUAL, HOWEVER, IS THE BREADTH AND VARIETY OF </p><p>HU\'S BACKING.  HIS MULTIPLE NETWORKS, IN TURN, HAVE </p><p>ALLOWED HIM TO CAPITALIZE ON HIS STATUS AS THE HEIR </p><p>APPOINTED BY DENG AND HIS SKILLS AS A CONSENSUS-BUILDER, </p><p>AND TO AVOID LINKING HIS FATE TOO CLOSELY TO ANY ONE </p><p>FACTION WITHIN THE THIRD GENERATION.  HU\'S GENERAL </p><p>ABILITY TO AVOID DISABLING ENTANGLEMENTS HAS, ACCORDING </p><p>TO AT LEAST ONE WELL-INFORMED SOURCE, ENHANCED THE VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S REPUTATION AS A CONSENSUS-BUILDER AND </p><p>STRENGTHENED HIS SUPPORT AMONG DIVERSE FACTIONS WITHIN </p><p>THE PARTY.  IT WAS THIS STRENGTH, ACCORDING TO THIS </p><p>SOURCE, THAT ALLOWED HU TO BLUNT JIANG\'S EFFORTS DURING </p><p>THE 2000 CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM TO WIN ZENG QINGHONG\'S </p><p>PROMOTION TO THE POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) NONETHELESS, HU\'S RECORD IN GAINING THE SUPPORT </p><p>OF IMPORTANT FACTIONS IS NOT PERFECT.  A PARTY </p><p>PRINCELING GROUP HEADED BY HE GUANGWEI REPORTEDLY </p><p>ENGINEERED HU\'S SUMMARY DEPARTURE FROM THE CYL IN 1985 </p><p>AND HIS APPOINTMENT AS PARTY SECRETARY OF POVERTY- </p><p>STRICKEN GUIZHOU PROVINCE.  CONTACTS ATTRIBUTED THIS </p><p>INCIDENT BOTH TO JEALOUSY OF HU AND TO THE FACTIONAL </p><p>INFIGHTING THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO HU YAOBANG\'S DEMISE. </p><p>WHILE NONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE SINCE RISEN ABOVE </p><p>THE VICE-MINISTER LEVEL, IT IS UNCLEAR TO WHAT DEGREE </p><p>THE AFTERMATH OF THIS INCIDENT COULD AFFECT HU\'S FUTURE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH OTHER PARTY PRINCELINGS. </p><p> </p><p>IS HU A CLOSET REFORMER? </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) HU HAS BEEN CAREFUL SINCE 1992 NOT TO DIVERGE </p><p>FROM JIANG ON THE ISSUE OF POLITICAL REFORM.  YET HINTS </p><p>FROM HIS PAST SUGGEST THAT HE MAY HAVE REFORMIST </p><p>INCLINATIONS, SOURCES REPORT.  ACCORDING TO A WELL- </p><p>CONNECTED ACADEMIC, WHILE IN GUIZHOU (1985-1988), HU </p><p>ENCOURAGED HIS SUBORDINATES TO EXPERIMENT WITH ECONOMIC </p><p>AND LIMITED SOCIAL REFORMS.  HU\'S ECONOMIC POLICIES AT </p><p>THAT TIME WERE IN LINE WITH THE REFORMS BEING INTRODUCED </p><p>ALONG CHINA\'S COASTAL REGIONS, BUT WERE CONSIDERED TO BE </p><p>UNIQUE IN AN INTERIOR PROVINCE.  AS CYL FIRST SECRETARY, </p><p>HU WAS AT THE FOREFRONT OF DEFENDING HU YAOBANG\'S </p><p>REFORMS AGAINST CONSERVATIVE ATTACKS AS "SPIRITUAL </p><p>POLLUTION."  FURTHERMORE, AS PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL </p><p>PARTY SCHOOL, HE HAS MOVED TO PROFESSIONALIZE THE </p><p>CURRICULUM, AND ENCOURAGED THE SCHOOL TO BRING IN MORE </p><p>OUTSIDE EXPERTS AND TO RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES TO </p><p>TRADITIONAL SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY.  MANY ALSO POINT TO THE </p><p>HEAVY INVOLVEMENT BY CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL LEADERS IN THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF JIANG\'S "THREE REPRESENTS," AND HU\'S OWN </p><p>ROLE AS ONE OF THE CHIEF CHEERLEADERS FOR "JIANG </p><p>THOUGHT." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) WHILE MOST CONTACTS CONCUR THAT HU RECOGNIZES </p><p>THE NEED FOR CHANGE, THE TYPE AND PACE OF REFORM HE </p><p>MIGHT FAVOR IS STILL UNCLEAR.  SOME CONTACTS ASSERT </p><p>WISTFULLY THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT\'S SUPPORT THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF "JIANG THOUGHT" IS GENUINE, AND </p><p>THAT HE VIEWS THOSE CONCEPTS AS STEPPING STONES TO MORE </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL REFORMS.  STILL OTHERS MAINTAIN THAT HU\'S </p><p>CULTURAL REVOLUTION EXPERIENCE HAS SENSITIZED HIM TO THE </p><p>DESTABILIZING DANGERS OF TOO-RAPID CHANGE AND THAT HE </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO "GO SLOW."  NO MATTER WHERE HU STANDS </p><p>ON REFORM, HOWEVER, ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO HU\'S FRIENDS HAS </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT HU\'S STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTING CHANGE </p><p>WILL LIKELY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAVY- </p><p>HANDED "CAMPAIGN"-STYLE TACTICS THAT JIANG HAS FAVORED </p><p>IN MOVING FORWARD HIS OWN AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) WHILE HU JINTAO APPEARS WELL-GROOMED TO TAKE ON </p><p>THE CHALLENGE OF GUIDING CHINA INTO THE 21ST CENTURY, </p><p>HIS ABILITY TO AFFECT CHANGE WILL IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS </p><p>DEPEND UPON HIS ABILITY TO PERSUADE THE 63 MILLION PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS THAT CHANGE IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST.  AT THE </p><p>VERY LEAST, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT HU WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>AFFECT ANY MAJOR CHANGES FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER HE </p><p>TAKES OVER THE "CORE" LEADERSHIP ROLE.  EVEN IF HU\'S </p><p>TRANSITION GOES SMOOTHLY, HE WILL STILL NEED TO SPEND </p><p>SEVERAL YEARS CONSOLIDATING HIS POSITION AMONG THE </p><p>PARTY\'S MEMBERSHIP -- MOST OF WHOM WOULD IMMEDIATELY </p><p>BLOCK ANY REFORM-ORIENTED ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THE </p><p>PERKS THEY HAVE COME TO TAKE FOR GRANTED. </p><p> </p><p>RANDT </p><p></p></div>
