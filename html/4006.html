<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 001954 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS AND INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, PHUM, MV, UN, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  Maldives: President Goyoom announces cabinet </p><p>changes and new diplomatic appointments </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- </p><p>Please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In an October 9 announcement, Maldivian President </p><p>Maumoon Gayoom announced changes to his cabinet, and </p><p>appointed new ambassadors to Sri Lanka and the UN. </p><p>Please see Para four for a complete listing of the new </p><p>appointments. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Mission has carefully reviewed Gayoom\'s </p><p>announcement and has the following comments re the </p><p>selections: </p><p> </p><p>-- Of particular note was the appointment of Raashida </p><p>Yoosuf as the High Commissioner to Sri Lanka.  Yoosuf </p><p>was the Minister of Women\'s Affairs and Social Welfare </p><p>at the time of her appointment.  She is reportedly the </p><p>first woman ever chosen to be a Maldivian ambassador. </p><p>(Note:  The Sri Lanka high commissioner slot is an </p><p>important one for the Maldives, which transacts much </p><p>commercial and other business out of Colombo.  The </p><p>selection of Yoosuf follows in the wake of Gayoom\'s </p><p>naming of the first woman as Atoll Chief last year. </p><p>Atoll Chief is an influential position in the Maldives.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Yoosuf\'s predecessor as high commissioner in Sri </p><p>Lanka, Abdul Azeez, has been named Deputy Minister of </p><p>Housing.  Azeez, the former dean of Colombo\'s diplomatic </p><p>corps, had served in Sri Lanka for years. </p><p> </p><p>-- Also of note was the appointment of Mohamed Latheef </p><p>as the Ambassador to the UN.  Latheef is leaving his </p><p>position as Minister of Education, which he held for </p><p>nine years, to take his position at the UN.  Both </p><p>Yoosuf\'s and Latheef\'s positions are cabinet-level.  We </p><p>understand that the GoRM is preparing a formal request </p><p>to have Mr. Latheef co-accredited to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Following are the appointments to the Maldivian </p><p>cabinet and diplomatic corps that were announced on </p><p>October 9: </p><p> </p><p>-- Aneesa Ahmed was appointed Minister of Women\'s </p><p>Affairs and Social Security.  She was formally the </p><p>Deputy Minister in this ministry; </p><p> </p><p>-- Abdul Azeez was appointed Deputy Minister of Home </p><p>Affairs, Housing and Environment.  He was formally the </p><p>Ambassador to Sri Lanka; </p><p> </p><p>-- Midhat Hilmy was appointed Minister of Communication, </p><p>Science and Technology.

He was formally the Assistant Director </p><p>General in this ministry; </p><p> </p><p>-- Raashida Yoosuf was appointed Ambassador to Sri </p><p>Lanka.  She was the Minister of Women\'s Affairs and </p><p>Social Welfare. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
