<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 09309 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PINS, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC PUBLICLY REJECTS DISARMAMENT </p><p> </p><p>1. U) SUMMARY:  THE FARC GUERRILLA HIGH COMMAND ON JULY </p><p>7 PUBLICLY REJECTED "DEMOBILIZATION OR DISARMAMENT" FOR </p><p>ITS FORCES, CLAIMING FURTHER THAT IT HAD NEVER PROMISED </p><p>SUCH ACTION.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) FARC-UP IN ARMS:  IN A RADIO PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>JULY 7, TOP LEADERS OF THE COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED </p><p>FORCES (FARC), COLOMBIA\'S LARGEST GUERRILLA GROUP, </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT DEMOBILIZE OR DISARM THEIR </p><p>FORCES.  FOLLOWING THE JUNE 16 CAQUETA AMBUSH, THE GOC </p><p>STATED THAT ANY FURTHER SESSIONS OF THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>WOULD BE LIMITED TO DISCUSSIONS OF THESE TOPICS.  FARC </p><p>COMMANDERS ADDED THAT THEY HAD NEVER PROMISED </p><p>DISARMAMENT: "NEITHER AS A POLICY NOR IN RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>AGREEMENTS OF LA URIBE, WAS THAT SPOKEN OF."  FARC </p><p>COMMANDER MANUEL MARULANDA, "TIROFIJO" (SURE-SHOT), </p><p>SPOKE, AS DID HIS DEPUTY AND CHIEF IDEOLOGUE JACOBO </p><p>ARENAS, AND ALFONSO CANO.  THE BROADCAST REPORTEDLY </p><p>ORIGINATED FROM A SOUTH BOGOTA SITE AND WAS TRANSMITTED </p><p>ON VARYING FREQUENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) UNREPENTANT:  THE FARC LEADERS INSISTED THEY </p><p>WOULD REMAIN INSIDE THE TRUCE WITH THE GOC, BUT ADDED </p><p>THAT MORE INCIDENTS LIKE THE RECENT CAQUETA AMBUSH COULD </p><p>WELL OCCUR, BECAUSE OF "MILITARY PERSECUTION."  THEY </p><p>REVEALED THAT THEY HAD SPOKEN THE SAME DAY TO THE GOC </p><p>USING THE "HOT LINE" TELEPHONE FROM THEIR HEADQUARTERS </p><p>AT LA URIBE AND HAD MADE 19 COMPLAINTS, MAINLY RELATED </p><p>TO ALLEGED GOC MILITARY OPERATIONS NOW UNDERWAY AGAINST </p><p>"VARIOUS FRONTS" OF THE FARC.  THEY CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>CAQUETA INCIDENT WAS THE RESULT OF MILITARY OPERATIONS, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH "FOR THE SAKE OF DISCUSSION" THEY WERE </p><p>WILLING TO USE THE WORD AMBUSH.  THEY POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>SIMILAR GOC-GUERRILLA INCIDENTS HAD OCCURRED UNDER THE </p><p>PREVIOUS (BETANCUR) GOVERNMENT, BUT HAD BEEN OVERCOME </p><p>BECAUSE THE DESIRE TO DO SO EXISTED -- INSTANCING THE </p><p>AMBUSH AND DEATH OF 22 FARC GUERRILLAS IN ANTIOQUIA AT </p><p>THE HANDS OF GOC MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) STRIKE NOW; TALK LATER:  FARC LEADERS ANNOUNCED </p><p>THAT THEY WOULD ATTEMPT TO ORGANIZE (PRESUMABLY USING </p><p>THE PATRIOTIC UNION, THE COMMUNIST-FRONT POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY) A NATIONAL PROTEST STRIKE TO "REESTABLISH THE LA </p><p>URIBE ACCORDS."  THEY COMPLAINED THAT THOSE ACCORDS HAD </p><p>NEVER BEEN PROPERLY CARRIED OUT, SINCE THE "POLITICAL, </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS CONTEMPLATED THEREIN" HAD </p><p>NEVER BEEN CARRIED OUT.  THEY INDICATED CONTINUED </p><p>INTEREST IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOC, BUT SAID THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEND A HIGH-LEVEL COMMISSION TO THEIR </p><p>HEADQUARTERS; THAT THE (BETANCUR-ERA) COMMISSIONS OF </p><p>DIALOGUE AND VERIFICATION SHOULD BE REESTABLISHED; THAT </p><p>DIALOGUE SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON PRIOR CONDITIONS </p><p>(LIKE THE GOC\'S INSISTENCE ON TALKING ABOUT </p><p>DISARMAMENT); AND THAT THE "ATMOSPHERE" DID NOT </p><p>CURRENTLY EXIST FOR TALKING ABOUT DISARMAMENT AND </p><p>DEMOBILIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (LOU)  WHAT DID THE FARC PROMISE?  RAFAEL PARDO, </p><p>SECRETARY OF POPULAR INTEGRATION AND ASSISTANT TO </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL PEACE ADVISOR CARLOS OSSA ESCOBAR, TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE 1984 LA URIBE ACCORDS, AND THE 1986 RENEWAL, </p><p>IMPLY DISARMAMENT, AND DIRECTED US TO THE RELEVANT </p><p>ARTICLES.  IN FACT, THE LANGUAGE OF THE SECTIONS HE </p><p>SUGGESTED IS VAGUE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT VARIOUS </p><p>INTERPRETATIONS.  ARTICLE 6 OF THE 1984 ACCORD SPEAKS OF </p><p>A ONE-YEAR PERIOD FOR THE FARC TO "ORGANIZE ITSELF </p><p>POLITICALLY, ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY."  "DURING THIS </p><p>PERIOD THE GOVERNMENT WILL UNDERTAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS </p><p>TO REESTABLISH CIVIC ORDER IN THE ZONES OF VIOLENCE." </p><p>ARTICLE 3 OF THE 1986 RENEWAL SAYS THAT THE FARC WILL </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN PEACEFUL ELECTIONS "WITHOUT PHYSICAL, </p><p>MORAL OR ECONOMIC COERCION."  ARTICLE 6 OF THE SAME TEXT </p><p>CALLS ON THE FARC TO INTENSIFY ITS INCORPORATION INTO </p><p>"POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE AND PRODUCTIVE CIVIC ACTION, </p><p>SO THAT WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME ITS ADHERENTS WILL </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN FULL INSTITUTIONAL NORMALITY." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>6.  (LOU) THE GOC FEELS THAT PARTICIPATION IN PEACEFUL </p><p>ELECTIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO ARMED INTIMIDATION -- AND </p><p>"INCORPORATION INTO FULL INSTITUTIONAL NORMALITY" -- ARE </p><p>MEANINGLESS WITHOUT DISARMAMENT AND DEMOBILIZATION.  THE </p><p>FARC CLAIMS TO SEE NO CONTRADICTION, AND IS LIKELY TO </p><p>INSIST ON A LITERAL READING OF THE ACCORDS, WHICH DO NOT </p><p>USE THE WORDS DISARMAMENT OR DEMOBILIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (LOU)  ANOTHER STEP IN THE DECLINE OF THE TRUCE AND </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  THE FARC\'S MAIN CONCERN, AS WE SEE IT, </p><p>WAS PROBABLY TO SCORE POINTS IN THE ON-GOING BATTLE TO </p><p>FIX BLAME FOR THAT DECLINE. </p><p> </p><p>GILLESPIE </p><p></p></div>
