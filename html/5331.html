<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000145 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, MCAP, PTER, PGOV, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  ARMY TO COURT-MARTIAL TWO IN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>CASE; HOME MINISTRY DEFIES COURT ORDER TO RELEASE DETAINEES </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 0087 </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>RNA TO COURT-MARTIAL TWO IN SHOOTING INCIDENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  On January 25 Defense Secretary Madan Prasad Aryal </p><p>announced in a speech at the Reporters Club that the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army (RNA) will court-martial soldiers involved in the </p><p>November 27 killings of five young men and boys in Nuwakot </p><p>District (Reftel).  (Note:  The RNA maintains the five were </p><p>mistaken for Maoists as they were returning late from a </p><p>funeral in a rural area and failed to identify themselves to </p><p>sentries.  End note.)  On January 27 a member of the RNA </p><p>human rights cell, which had investigated the incident and </p><p>found the five were innocent of Maoist connections, confirmed </p><p>that a captain and one soldier will stand trial in the </p><p>incident.  In addition, the Home Ministry has decided to </p><p>provide approximately USD 1300 each to the families of a </p><p>14-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man killed in the crossfire </p><p>between the RNA and Maoists in Myagdi District in December. A </p><p>final determination of whether to investigate further </p><p>allegations of custodial rape committed by officers in </p><p>Nepalganj, Banke District (Reftel) is still before the Chief </p><p>of Army Staff. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>HOME MINISTRY DEFIES SUPREME COURT ORDERS ON DETAINEES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The Home Ministry has so far failed to respond to </p><p>Supreme Court orders that it release 12 detainees, arrested </p><p>as suspected Maoists and reportedly being held in Kathmandu </p><p>jails, because of insufficient evidence.  On January 5 the </p><p>Supreme Court ordered the release of Dambar Karki, Haridwar </p><p>Kunwar, Shantiram Bhattarai, Narayan Adhikari, and </p><p>16-year-old Chaturman Gurung, all of whom were arrested under </p><p>the Terrorist and Destructive Activities Act (TADA).  (Note: </p><p>The TADA allows for suspects to be held without charge for 60 </p><p>days and in preventive detention for up to 90 days.  In </p><p>practice, many detainees have been held without charge for </p><p>much longer periods.  End note.)  The Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) maintains the five are not in custody, a point disputed </p><p>by family and lawyers, who claim to have seen them in jail. </p><p>On January 23 the Supreme Court ordered the Home Ministry, </p><p>police headquarters, and RNA to show cause why another seven </p><p>detainees, also believed to be held in Kathmandu jails, have </p><p>not been released.  No reply has been received to this order. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The local press reported that on January 24 </p><p>plainclothes security personnel immediately re-arrested </p><p>another detainee, Janak Prasad Adhikari, following his </p><p>release from the district jail in Nuwakot by order of the </p><p>Supreme Court.  The Chief District Officer (CDO) in Nuwakot </p><p>told us January 27 that Adhikari had not been re-arrested by </p><p>district authorities; if others outside the district had </p><p>arrested Adhikari, the CDO knew nothing about it, he asserted. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The RNA has been stung recently by charges that it </p><p>has failed to hold its soldiers accountable for alleged human </p><p>rights abuses (Reftel).  Most accounts of the Nuwakot </p><p>incident, however, depict it as a tragic mistake that </p><p>occurred as the unidentified group of young men and boys </p><p>advanced on the RNA perimeter at night.  This incident marks </p><p>the first occasion RNA soldiers have been ordered to stand </p><p>court-martial since the Army\'s deployment against the </p><p>insurgents more than one year ago.  Since the declaration of </p><p>the state of emergency in November 2001, the GON has arrested </p><p>an unknown number of suspects under special anti-terrorism </p><p>legislation.  Few of these suspects have been formally </p><p>charged; even fewer have been tried.  The legal, judicial and </p><p>penal systems are clearly overwhelmed.  Ignoring Supreme </p><p>Court orders to produce detainees, as the Home Ministry seems </p><p>to have elected to do, will do little to ameliorate the </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
