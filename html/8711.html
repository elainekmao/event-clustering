<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001049 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POLITICAL ROUNDUP JUNE 13 </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 934 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASON: 1.5 (B) </p><p>and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS PERIODIC JOINT POLITICAL REPORT FROM ABUJA AND </p><p>LAGOS INCLUDES: </p><p>2. </p><p>--ELECTION TRIBUNALS UPDATE </p><p>--WABARA FOR SENATE PRESIDENT </p><p>--VIOLENCE-FREE INAUGURATION </p><p>--DO THE JUNE 20 ELECTIONS MATTER? </p><p>--VIOLENCE IN ADAMAWA STATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>ELECTION TRIBUNALS UPDATE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The election tribunals continue to hear cases. </p><p>Several relatively minor cases have been thrown out on </p><p>various technicalities.  In the lone election to be annulled </p><p>so far, a tribunal in Edo State rejected PDP House of </p><p>Representatives candidate Jun Adun\'s victory and awarded the </p><p>seat to his ANPP challenger, Amen Osunde.  Though many </p><p>elections face challenges in the tribunals, the House and </p><p>Senate already held their opening sessions and selected the </p><p>legislative leadership.  Both houses have adjourned until </p><p>June 24. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WABARA FOR SENATE PRESIDENT </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Although at the center of an election fracas over his </p><p>reelection, PDP Senator Aldolphus Wabara was chosen last week </p><p>as the new Senate President.  INEC originally announced ANPP </p><p>candidate Dan Imo as the winner of the Abia South-Central </p><p>Senatorial seat. President Obasanjo even sent Imo a </p><p>congratulatory message.  Nevertheless, on June 2, the Federal </p><p>High Court in Abuja ordered INEC to change course and certify </p><p>Wabara as the victor.  Imo has asked the High Court to vacate </p><p>its order.  The High Court has not yet responded to Imo and </p><p>the case is still pending before an election tribunal.  For </p><p>the moment, Wabara has assumed his post as Senate President. </p><p>Meanwhile, Justice Egbo Egbo, who issued the ruling to INEC, </p><p>has been called before a tribunal headed by Supreme Court </p><p>Chief Justice Uwais. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>VIOLENCE-FREE INAUGURATION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Despite calls by some in the opposition parties for </p><p>"mass action" to derail President Obasanjo\'s May 29 </p><p>inauguration, Nigeria was calm and peaceful and the inaugural </p><p>activities nearly hitch-free throughout.  In anticipation of </p><p>disturbances on the day of inauguration, large numbers of </p><p>troops and police were deployed in Abuja and other major </p><p>population centers.  The National Assembly convened its </p><p>inaugural session without problem.  There were no reported </p><p>incidents of large-scale violence or protests.  After having </p><p>their attempts to thwart the inauguration through legal </p><p>maneuvering rejected by the Courts, opposition parties now </p><p>await rulings from the various electoral tribunals.  Detailed </p><p>analysis of the opposition and its options will follow septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>DO THE JUNE 20 ELECTIONS MATTER? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Conventional wisdom is that local government elections </p><p>would take place on June 20 in all 36 states.  However, since </p><p>the timing of the elections is controlled by each state, </p><p>elections in several states could be postponed due to </p><p>political or logistical considerations (NOTE: LGA elections </p><p>were originally scheduled for March 2002.  END NOTE.)  There </p><p>have been reports in the domestic media and from mission </p><p>sources that predict several governors will either delay or </p><p>cancel LGA elections in their states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: In addition to "election fatigue," creation </p><p>of new LGAs might be the driving force behind election delays </p><p>or cancellations in some states.  Currently, Nigeria has 774 </p><p>constitutionally mandated LGAs.  Funds for each of these LGAs </p><p>are earmarked by the Federal Government as a portion of the </p><p>monies it disburses to the states.  Since newly created LGAs </p><p>will not receive these earmarked Federal monies they could be </p><p>more easily controlled by the state governors who control </p><p>their access to funding.  Governors who advocate creating new </p><p>LGAs will seek to delay elections until they can do so. </p><p>Governor Makarfi of Kaduna State is attempting to create 25 </p><p>new Local Government Areas and has declared his intention to </p><p>cancel the upcoming elections.  Several other states have </p><p>also announced intentions to create new LGAs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: At the national level, the LGA </p><p>elections have little more impact than providing an </p><p>opportunity for sitting governors to solidify their control </p><p>of their respective states.  Whether a state holds LGA </p><p>elections on June 20 or delays them depends largely on </p><p>whether having elections sooner or later (or not at all) will </p><p>be more advantageous to the chief executive of the state </p><p>concerned.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>VIOLENCE IN ADAMAWA STATE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) There was an outbreak of religious/communal violence </p><p>in Numan, Adamawa State on June 8.  According to newspaper </p><p>and radio reports, eight people were killed during a riot </p><p>sparked when a non-local Muslim "water hawker" stabbed a </p><p>female Christian evangelist during an argument over the cost </p><p>of a jerry can of water.  A mosque and "several other places </p><p>of worship" reportedly were razed during the riot.  A </p><p>dusk-to-dawn curfew has been in effect since Sunday, June 8, </p><p>and there have been no further reports of violence in the </p><p>area.  (COMMENT: This incident is illustrative of the </p><p>underlying religious tension in many Nigerian communities. </p><p>Religion may have only played a minor role in the event that </p><p>caused this eruption but it was enough to provoke widespread </p><p>violence this community.  Fortunately, this incident was </p><p>localized and brought quickly under control.  There is no </p><p>indication the violence in Numan has significantly raised the </p><p>level of tension in other areas of Adamawa state, or </p><p>neighboring areas, or other s </p><p>tates in Nigeria.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
