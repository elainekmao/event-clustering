<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001582 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: WEEKEND DEMONSTRATIONS IN JORDAN SIZABLE, PEACEFUL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 745 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 974 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  The weekend of March 15-16 saw sizable </p><p>GOJ-permitted demonstrations in Amman and Irbid as well as </p><p>smaller gatherings in other locations.  The demonstrations </p><p>were peaceful, with no security incidents reported. </p><p>Estimates of crowd sizes varied widely, but reliable sources </p><p>indicate that Amman saw approximately 3,000 participants </p><p>while Irbid had as many as 2,000.  The message was largely </p><p>standard: anti-USG policy, pro-Palestinian, and supportive of </p><p>the Iraqi people.  However, both major demonstrations carried </p><p>a new "theme" protesting rumored US troops in Jordan and the </p><p>possibility that Jordan could be a "launch-pad" for allied </p><p>action against Iraq.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C).  Credible media reports and embassy contacts present </p><p>at the March 16 demonstration in Amman report that there were </p><p>approximately 3,000 participants.  (Note: media reports put </p><p>the number in Amman variously as 5,000, 10,000 and as high as </p><p>25,000, but these estimates may reflect wishful thinking). </p><p>The gathering in Amman, organized by the "Higher Coordination </p><p>for Opposition Parties", traversed the well-worn march route </p><p>from the Professional Association Headquarters to the United </p><p>Nations offices in the Shmeisani district.  There was a heavy </p><p>security presence.  Demonstrators chanted standard anti-USG </p><p>rhetoric, rallied "against the war" and proclaimed their </p><p>support for Palestinians and Iraqis.  According to media </p><p>reports and embassy contacts, there were some vocal calls </p><p>against American troops on Jordanian soil and against the </p><p>possibility that America might use Jordan as a "launch-pad" </p><p>into Iraq.  One media report indicated that a few slogans </p><p>directly criticized PM Abul Ragheb (who in recent days has </p><p>publicly dismissed rumors of USG troops in Jordan).  The </p><p>peaceful demonstration lasted approximately one and a half </p><p>hours and dispersed without incident.  One American </p><p>journalist, who has been in Jordan several months and </p><p>witnessed other demonstrations, described this one as "most </p><p>unspectacular!" </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  In Irbid, approximately 2,000 marched to a similar </p><p>beat.  The demonstration, organized by the leftist "Jordanian </p><p>People\'s Party", proceeded peacefully amidst a strong </p><p>security presence.  Standard pro-Palestinian, anti-war </p><p>rhetoric was salted with slogans decrying the "double </p><p>standard" of USG policy and admonishments against allowing US </p><p>troops on Jordanian soil. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Smaller gatherings occurred over the weekend without </p><p>incident.  Embassy contacts report small, vocal gatherings of </p><p>young adults (i.e. 30-50) in refugee camps.  (Note: the </p><p>overall mood in the camps, despite lack of visible protests, </p><p>is tense.)  On March 10, GOJ Department of Palestinian </p><p>Affairs Director General Abdulkarim Abulhaija told RefCoord </p><p>that he and the security services "are working day and night" </p><p>to convince the refugee camps\' political leaders -- both camp </p><p>committees and leaders of various Palestinian factions -- </p><p>that they should not take to the streets in the event of </p><p>hostilities in Iraq.  According to Abulhaija, Palestinian </p><p>refugees in Jordan view Saddam Hussein as a champion of the </p><p>Palestinian cause and will view a US-led attack on Iraq as </p><p>furtherance of a "Zionist agenda."  Abulhaija assured </p><p>RefCoord that he and the security services are prepared to do </p><p>everything in their power to maintain order in Jordan\'s </p><p>refugee camps, but believes that it could be difficult. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In Jerash, the "political party organization </p><p>committee" sponsored a "speech rally" on March 15 where IAF </p><p>member Ali Leytoom reportedly delivered a polemic on the </p><p>"conspiracy of the Zionist international movement" to a small </p><p>audience (reportedly about a hundred people). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  These demonstrations were similar in size, message </p><p>and behavior to previous anti-war demonstrations (reftels). </p><p>The GOJ appears to be handling the gatherings well, allowing </p><p>Jordanian anti-war organizers to coordinate their events with </p><p>anti-war movements worldwide.  In general, our contacts hold </p><p>the view that demonstrations here will likely remain tightly </p><p>controlled and non-violent (despite the tension in the camps) </p><p>unless the hot button issue of the Israel/Palestinian </p><p>conflict flares up significantly. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Despite the lackluster rallies, the general public </p><p>mood is hostile to the U.S., and especially so toward an </p><p>attack on Iraq.  There is a core of organizers who hold even </p><p>more deep-seated anti-U.S. views, and we are seeing more </p><p>written tracts calling the U.S. the "number one enemy" of </p><p>Arabs and Muslims.  This more radical minority will continue </p><p>to express their anti-U.S. views, and could be tempted to </p><p>take even more activist steps in the future. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
