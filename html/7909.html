<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000560 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS: THE BEATDOWN GOES ON </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 430 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The future is not clear, and certainly not </p><p>bright, at end of the second full month of the Burmese </p><p>banking crisis.  The banks\' restrictions on withdrawals are </p><p>still in place as are orders that banks recover outstanding </p><p>loans.  Bankers continue to speculate on mergers and </p><p>bankruptcies, though none have yet gone under.  Companies\' </p><p>ability to muddle through, and the resurgence of the </p><p>underground financial system, have managed to contain the </p><p>economic spillover in the short term.  However, the absence </p><p>of effective private banks will constrain long-term growth </p><p>and may hinder future economic reforms.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>The End is Nigh? </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Bankers and businessmen are more certain than ever </p><p>that the private banking system is finished.  During the </p><p>month of April the government remained silent on the banks\' </p><p>problems and made no move to lessen controls on the banks or </p><p>use Central Bank funds to improve liquidity.  Withdrawal </p><p>limits also remained at 100,000 kyat (about $100) per week </p><p>per depositor, and new deposits were negligible, because of </p><p>low public confidence in the banking system, and the </p><p>government\'s refusal to sanction special treatment for new </p><p>depositors.  The GOB\'s Private Bank Management Committee </p><p>continues to meet nightly, requiring all private banks to </p><p>submit records of that day\'s withdrawals, deposits, and loan </p><p>repayments. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) For the second month in a row, the private banks, </p><p>under order from the Bank Management Committee to bring in as </p><p>much as 70 percent of their loans by the end of April, are </p><p>leaning on their borrowers (with the help of Military </p><p>Intelligence) to repay as much, and as quickly, as possible. </p><p>The Committee seems to be focused primarily on the larger </p><p>banks, like Yoma Bank, AWB, and KBZ Bank, which had the vast </p><p>majority of outstanding (and likely rotten) loans, and which </p><p>were recipients of Central Bank advances at the start of the </p><p>crisis.  However, even the smaller banks are under pressure </p><p>from the authorities, and from their own deteriorating bottom </p><p>lines, to call in what they can. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Despite this pressure, large and small bankers tell us </p><p>that they had little success meeting their April objectives. </p><p>One banker blamed a continuing slowdown of the economy, plus </p><p>the general need for cash around the Burmese New Year </p><p>festivities (April 13-17), for the sluggish recouping of </p><p>loans.  On top of zero deposit growth, the slowing of loan </p><p>repayments has led to worsening cash positions in April for </p><p>the banks with whom we spoke. </p><p> </p><p>Industry Continues to Limp Along </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On the bright side, it appears that the majority of </p><p>employers met payroll again in April.  So far it appears that </p><p>banks are willing (with Committee approval) to open their </p><p>safes for large corporate customers.  The Union of Myanmar </p><p>Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) </p><p>reports that none of its members is complaining about an </p><p>inability to pay workers.  According to one banker, the Bank </p><p>Management Committee has been very willing to approve </p><p>requests for withdrawals over 100,000 kyat for emergencies </p><p>such as payroll and tax payments.  However, the Committee </p><p>reportedly often authorizes only 50-75 percent of the amount </p><p>requested. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Though it is too early to make any confident </p><p>assertions, there are some signs that the liquidity crisis </p><p>may be easing, at least so far as the real economy is </p><p>concerned.  Apparently, enough cash has returned to </p><p>circulation to restart some commerce, raise some asset </p><p>prices, and fund a measure of capital flight.  In any event, </p><p>beginning in mid-April, the price of the dollar and some used </p><p>cars started to creep back up (the dollar gaining 8 percent </p><p>on the kyat after declining nearly 20 percent in February and </p><p>March).  We give credit to the already large informal banking </p><p>network in Burma, which was able to take over a portion of </p><p>private banks\' lending, payment, and remittance activities. </p><p>Banking, in short, hasn\'t so much died in Burma as just gone </p><p>partially underground. </p><p> </p><p>What\'s the Plan? </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Private bankers argue that the GOB\'s policies seem </p><p>designed to bankrupt the private banks or force them into </p><p>mergers with their state or military-owned counterparts. </p><p>Some even hint that the GOB might move at the end of May, </p><p>when 100 percent of outstanding loans are ostensibly due for </p><p>repayment to the largest banks.  However, an official in one </p><p>of the country\'s larger banks said that at the current rate </p><p>his bank could survive another 2-3 months before giving up </p><p>the ghost.  An official at a smaller private bank said that </p><p>his institution could last at least through September. </p><p>8. (C) The government itself has been silent on its plans. </p><p>Nevertheless, it may view its actions as simply a prudent way </p><p>to squeeze speculative excesses out of the economy and hold </p><p>bankers accountable for their previous misdeeds.  The </p><p>relatively quick deflation of asset bubbles, and stable </p><p>consumer prices since the regime began its tough-love </p><p>strategy are taken as proof by top GOB officials that this </p><p>type of approach has been effective in dealing with the </p><p>banking problem while protecting the country\'s economic </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: "Bankers" or "Banking" Crisis? </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) For all the dire predictions of disaster that </p><p>accompanied the initial run on the banks and the decision to </p><p>limit withdrawals, the Burmese economy seems to be coping. </p><p>Trade continues, most retail prices have stabilized, and </p><p>payrolls are being met -- though some large construction </p><p>projects have stopped.  In part this is due to the cash-based </p><p>character of the Burmese economy.  Few people ever used </p><p>banks; the 550 billion kyat in recorded deposits at the </p><p>private banks in fact was only one-third to one-quarter of </p><p>estimated total money in circulation.  The underground honti </p><p>exchange system has also been able to step up to provide a </p><p>ready substitute for at least a portion of the private banks\' </p><p>payment services.  More expensive and less reliable than </p><p>private banks, the honti system is nevertheless available </p><p>everywhere in Burma.  Finally, the net value added by private </p><p>banks to Burma\'s economy had declined in recent years as the </p><p>banks, faced with ever expanding inflation and debilitating </p><p>government banking regulations, moved more and more into </p><p>speculative investments of doubtful economic value.  That has </p><p>stopped, hurting speculators -- in many cases bankers </p><p>themselves. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) In short, the longer this episode continues, the more </p><p>it appears to be a crisis for the individual banks rather </p><p>than Burma\'s economy as a whole.  In the end, some private </p><p>banks and some large families may be bankrupted, but to judge </p><p>by events to date, the economy will continue to tick along, </p><p>albeit at a slower pace.  Nevertheless, there will be a price </p><p>to pay.  Unless government banks can pick up the slack, the </p><p>inevitable chill on economic expansion and commerce caused by </p><p>the lack of a formal banking sector might limit the potential </p><p>for future economic reforms, such as the recent </p><p>liberalization of the rice market. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
