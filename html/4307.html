<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DESPITE APATHY AND MILD APPREHENSION, JORDANIANS </p><p>UNDERSTAND MAIN MESSAGE OF "JORDAN FIRST" </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6522 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Jordanian reaction to the recently </p><p>launched "Jordan First" initiative (reftel) has been </p><p>characterized primarily by apathy and mild apprehension. </p><p>Some welcome the campaign, while others are skeptical for </p><p>various reasons, including the fear that "Jordan First" could </p><p>exacerbate domestic East-Bank/West-Bank tensions.  In </p><p>general, Jordanians are willing to wait and see what </p><p>direction the "Jordan First" campaign takes. </p><p>Public apathy aside, members of the "Jordan First" committee </p><p>appear to be enthusiastic about their mandate and eager to </p><p>get moving.  PolOff met with two "Jordan First" committee </p><p>members, who said "Jordan First" is a crystallization of what </p><p>the King has always wanted, i.e. a focus on economic </p><p>opportunity, political participation and social issues. </p><p> </p><p>2  (C)  In the bigger picture, "Jordan First" is an attempt </p><p>by the GOJ to re-focus Jordanians away from regional issues </p><p>and towards domestic matters affecting their daily lives. </p><p>Given Jordan\'s pragmatic regional policies in the past, this </p><p>core message of the "Jordan First" campaign seems to be </p><p>getting through.  More broadly, the initiative represents </p><p>something relatively new in Jordan -- a policy formula that </p><p>honestly asserts the government\'s moderate policies instead </p><p>of dressing them up in pan-Arab rhetoric or denunciations of </p><p>neologism.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS:  "JORDAN FIRST" IS WHAT THE KING HAS </p><p>ALWAYS WANTED FOR THE PEOPLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  In separate meetings on Nov 5 and 6, PolOff met with </p><p>two "Jordan First" committee members, former Member of </p><p>Parliament Mahmoud Kharabsheh and Senator Marwan Doudin. </p><p>Both focused on the need for Jordanians to view "Jordan </p><p>First" as a mentality and not a mere slogan.  "This is a </p><p>higher order and should be a daily practice for all </p><p>Jordanians, regardless of where they come from.  We are going </p><p>to focus on the economy, on social programs, and on political </p><p>participation," Kharabsheh said.  It is, according to Doudin, </p><p>the embodiment of what King Abdullah always wanted.  From the </p><p>first day of his regime, Doudin said, the King has attempted </p><p>to be a leader for all Jordanians.  "He wants to help all </p><p>Jordanians.  \'Jordan First\' has been his message all along." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>FOCUSING ON POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND THE ECONOMY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Both Doudin and Kharabsheh mentioned that the King </p><p>cited a recent report indicating that 48 percent of </p><p>Jordanians don\'t care about elections.  "Jordanians don\'t </p><p>give a damn about elections.  The King is appalled by this," </p><p>Doudin said.  According to Doudin, one of the reasons for </p><p>such apathy lies in the failure of the Jordanian opposition </p><p>to work truly within the Jordanian political system.  "The </p><p>opposition here has unfortunately developed the fallacy in </p><p>their minds that opposition is a permanent job.  They should </p><p>work within our system in an effort to become the majority," </p><p>Doudin said.  Despite the King\'s call for a consolidation of </p><p>political parties, the opposition should not be discouraged </p><p>or worried.  "The King said to the committee in our first </p><p>meeting that it will look ridiculous to the world if we claim </p><p>to be a democracy without opposition." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Kharabsheh said that "Jordan First" will also focus </p><p>on "employment based on merit," indicating that the campaign </p><p>may face up to the entrenched patronage system here.  Doudin, </p><p>a Palestinian-Jordanian, said the committee has some ideas on </p><p>how to approach the issue.  "I understand there is a lack of </p><p>opportunity for many, especially young people, and like </p><p>everyone around the world, we have issues with transparency." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  On "Jordan First" and the press, Doudin made an </p><p>ominous comment about the need for the media to report within </p><p>the framework of the initiative.  He said the Jordan First </p><p>Committee would establish a media subcommittee to "determine </p><p>the limits and red lines that the media can abide by.  We </p><p>cannot just run loose." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>WE STILL ARE COMMITTED TO REGIONAL STRUGGLES </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Kharabsheh, an East-Banker and former Member of </p><p>Parliament, said that Jordan remains committed to the </p><p>Palestinian cause and support for the Iraqi people.  "Jordan </p><p>has always existed in a difficult area.  In light of this big </p><p>(regional) challenge to Jordan, we must enhance our domestic </p><p>situation in all areas."  Doudin agreed, and took a swipe at </p><p>the anti-normalization opposition here. "Our peace treaty </p><p>with Israel is an example of putting Jordan first.  Some </p><p>oppose it, but imagine the past two years without that </p><p>treaty.  Where would we be?  We\'re doing it quietly, but </p><p>we\'re working very hard to solve the Palestinian problem." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>SOME PALESTINIANS SEE SLOGAN AS PRO-EAST BANK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On October 20, PolOff met with the outspoken former PM </p><p>Taher Masri at his villa in Abdoun.  Masri, a </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanian, agreed that there are too many </p><p>political parties for Jordan\'s own good.  This however, </p><p>cannot be solved by government intervention or slogans.  "We </p><p>need elections," he said, noting that opening avenues of </p><p>political participation would in the long run discredit the </p><p>opposition, including the Muslim Brotherhood.  Masri said the </p><p>"Jordan First" strategy is being met with cynicism among </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanians, who believe the Jordan first strategy </p><p>is pointed at preserving East-Banker interests.  "They see it </p><p>as \'the Jordanian first\', not \'Jordan First\'.  It is </p><p>frightening to them." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  On October 20, PolOff met with former political </p><p>adviser to the King, Adnan Abu Odeh, also a </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanian.  Abu Odeh strongly believes that the </p><p>King is trying to bring the country together with the "Jordan </p><p>First" initiative, but that it is "bad timing."  Abu Odeh </p><p>commented that "Jordan First", as an ideal, is going to have </p><p>a tough time in a culture that has a historical propensity to </p><p>view issues in a "Pan-Arab" context.  Against that backdrop, </p><p>the current regional situation only makes "Jordan First" a </p><p>tougher sell. "If you introduce something like this now, </p><p>people are going to be suspicious."  Odeh worries that many </p><p>East-Bankers will see the "Jordan First" initiative "as a </p><p>validation of what they have always wanted to believe:  That </p><p>they are more important to the King than the West-Bankers </p><p>are." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  With "Jordan First," the King is seeking to lead </p><p>public opinion to accept a long-standing, but seldom </p><p>articulated notion:  that Jordan must place its national </p><p>interests above the emotion-laden (and usually pan-Arab) </p><p>agenda of the street and Arabic media.  Jordanians recognize </p><p>that King Hussein and his grandfather, King Abdullah I, </p><p>pursued pragmatic policies in dealing with the early Zionists </p><p>and, later, Israel, in confronting a Palestinian challenge to </p><p>Hashemite rule in 1970, and in trying (unsuccessfully) to </p><p>walk a fine line between the U.S. and Iraq in 1990.  These </p><p>policies --  the historical precursors to "Jordan First" -- </p><p>were generally masked by high rhetoric designed to blunt </p><p>opposition. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Although it focuses on a domestic agenda, the new </p><p>"Jordan First" media campaign is a clear attempt by the King </p><p>to prepare Jordanian public opinion for the possibility of </p><p>simultaneous conflicts on Jordan\'s east and west flanks.  An </p><p>underlying message in the King\'s August 15 speech to the </p><p>nation (ref b) and his October 9 MBC interview (ref c) was </p><p>that Jordan must chart its own course and take responsibility </p><p>for its own stability and well-being.  And -- despite cynical </p><p>comments by some about the "Jordan First" media campaign </p><p>itself -- the overall message resonates with many sectors of </p><p>the Jordanian population:  certainly with the military, </p><p>government, and East Bank nationalists, but also with the </p><p>West Bank economic elite and those West Bankers who </p><p>appreciate the benefits of citizenship, stability and </p><p>(relative) prosperity Jordan offers them.  The King\'s </p><p>addresses seem to have re-focused many Jordanians on the need </p><p>for the government to protect Jordan\'s stability and </p><p>prosperity in potential hard times to come. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
