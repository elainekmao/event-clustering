The DART conducted an assessment of the Al Tash Refugee </p><p>Camp near Ar Ramadi on 9 May.  Based on meetings with the </p><p>camp council and movement through the camp, the DART </p><p>determined there is not a critical humanitarian situation </p><p>within the camp.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Al Tash Refugee Camp is located approximately 12 </p><p>kilometers (km) south of the Iraqi city of Ar Ramadi and </p><p>approximately 110 km west of Baghdad.  The camp has been in </p><p>place for 23 years, and the population consists of ethnic </p><p>Kurds from Iran.  In 1982, the population of the camp was </p><p>reported to be approximately 45,000.  The DART was told that </p><p>many of that number repatriated and others emmigrated to </p><p>third countries.  Currently, the camp population is reported </p><p>to be 12,000 people (2,000 families), equally divided </p><p>between political refugees and those that arrived during the </p><p>Iran/Iraq war.  Over the last six weeks, approximately 1,100 </p><p>people from the camp have moved to the Jordanian border. </p><p>Approximately three families leave the camp daily for the </p><p>border region.  There was an International Committee of the </p><p>Red Cross (ICRC) presence in the camp from 1983 until 1988. </p><p>Until recently, there has been a United Nations High </p><p>Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) presence in the camp. </p><p> </p><p>3.  A UNHCR facility within the camp appeared to be in very </p><p>good condition.  The UNHCR personnel left just prior to the </p><p>recent conflict and have not returned.  In discussions with </p><p>the town council, it was quite apparent that there was much </p><p>displeasure with the UNHCR personnel that had been assigned </p><p>to the camp.  It was reported that letters requesting </p><p>repatriation that had been given to UNHCR staff, had not </p><p>been forwarded for action.  It is felt that the UNHCR will </p><p>have to do much damage control in order to mend its </p><p>relationship in the village. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>CAMP COUNCIL </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART met with the camp council for approximately one </p><p>hour.  Various issues were covered, but two demands were </p><p>adamantly stressed.  The first demand was for the </p><p>repatriation of approximately one-half the population.  The </p><p>second was the resettlement of the remaining camp population </p><p>that consider themselves political refugees, to third </p><p>countries.  It was noted that most would accept, as a </p><p>temporary solution, resettlement in Kurdish areas of Iraq. </p><p>The camp council also told the DART that camp residents </p><p>suffered from disorder and insecurity during the current </p><p>post-conflict period.  Prior to the conflict, each family </p><p>received a payment of 250 dinars every two months. </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Food has been distributed within the camp through the </p><p>Public Distribution System (PDS).  The last distribution </p><p>took place during the first week of May and consisted of </p><p>tea, sugar, and salt.  The council told the DART that the </p><p>last two distributions have not included rice and that there </p><p>is a lack of oil and rice.  Current food stocks consist of </p><p>flour, tea, sugar, and salt.  These stocks are sufficient to </p><p>last until August.  Of concern to camp residents was the </p><p>fact that due to the loss of the family stipend, there is no </p><p>way to access vegetables, wheat, or rice to supplement food </p><p>stocks.  Women within the camp claim that they have adequate </p><p>food resources; however, as noted above, the list does not </p><p>include protein-rich foods or essential oils. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>WATER </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The camp receives its water from a pumping station one </p><p>km from the camp.  The DART visited the pumping station on </p><p>its way to Al Tash.  At the time of the visit, no operator </p><p>was on site, but local residents were present.  The pumping </p><p>station uses the Euphrates River as its source of water and </p><p>had, until recently, stored the untreated water in two above </p><p>ground storage tanks, with an approximate capacity of </p><p>200,000 liters.  The local residents present at the station </p><p>said that the pumps that transfer water to the Al Tash camp </p><p>had not functioned for two weeks.  The pumps appeared to be </p><p>in good condition, and the cause of the disfunction could </p><p>not be determined.  Water continues to be distributed to the </p><p>camp by a gravity-fed cast iron pipe one km to the camp. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The water at the pumping station was tested for chlorine </p><p>and no residual chlorine was detected.  Residents of the </p><p>camp reported low pressure due to numerous leaks, many due </p><p>to residents along the pipe\'s course tapping into the line. </p><p>The camp has a small water pumping station, which receives </p><p>water from the main pumping station.  The pump station had a </p><p>pressure pump and a partially buried water storage tank. </p><p>The storage tank capacity could not be determined. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Two backup generators, one 100-kilovolt amperes (kva) </p><p>and one 250-kva, provide power to the water system when </p><p>electricity to the camp is not available.  An operator was </p><p>present at the site and provided information on the </p><p>distribution of water in the camp.  The operator has </p><p>maintained records of his pumping and distribution </p><p>activities.  Water is distributed through iron pipes to </p><p>homes in the camp.  The camp water distribution system is </p><p>divided into 34 sectors.  Water is distributed to sectors of </p><p>the camp for one hour every 15 days.  During this time </p><p>homeowners fill their individual storage tanks.  Water </p><p>storage capacity in homes visited ranged from 2,000 to 5,500 </p><p>liters.  Individual homeowners owned metal and concrete </p><p>tanks and the homes visited appeared to have adequate </p><p>quantities stored in their water tanks. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SANITATION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  In moving through the camp, the DART noted that the </p><p>streets were relatively clear of rubbish.  Open ditches are </p><p>used to transport wash water from the homes to a ditch </p><p>outside the camp.  These ditches were clogged with garbage. </p><p>No discharge of sewage from toilet facilities to the ditches </p><p>was observed.  Residents stated that sewage is not </p><p>discharged to the ditch.  Toilet facilities within </p><p>residences consisted of water seal toilets directly above </p><p>cesspits.  The toilets visited were clean and well </p><p>maintained.  General overall hygiene is poor.  Hygiene </p><p>issues could probably be addressed with a more frequent </p><p>water delivery schedule as well as hygiene education. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  As the camp was visited on a Friday, the small clinic </p><p>that serves the camp\'s medical needs was closed.  Normally, </p><p>patients with acute problems are referred to the Ar Ramadi </p><p>hospital.  A pharmacist who accompanied the DART Health </p><p>Specialist throughout the assessment staffs the camp clinic. </p><p>There is neither a physician nor a nurse in the camp.  There </p><p>are a number of chronic diseases in the camp such as </p><p>thallasemia, cancer, epilepsy, mental illness, anemia, </p><p>tuberculosis, asthma, chronic eczema, and alopecia.  All of </p><p>these receive less-than-optimal follow-up but are typical of </p><p>chronic neglect that the camp has received for many years. </p><p>No cases of chronic or acute malnutrition were identified. </p><p> </p><p>11.  It was reported that the end of the former regime has </p><p>led to an increased resistance from the Arab-run hospital at </p><p>Ar Ramadi to treating the camp population without immediate </p><p>payment.  Cost of services, both acute and chronic follow- </p><p>up, has also escalated at the Ar Ramadi hospital.  During </p><p>the DART visit, much attention was given to about a half- </p><p>dozen children who suffered flash burns resulting from </p><p>igniting toys containing gunpowder.  All the burns were </p><p>first-degree and superficial second-degree that were treated </p><p>with salves and were healing.  Two cases of typhoid were </p><p>noted. Both cases are under appropriate treatment and are </p><p>improving. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p>12.  There is not a humanitarian crisis within the camp. </p><p>The situation within the camp appears to not have changed </p><p>significantly in the recent past, with the exception of the </p><p>loss of the small stipend.  Nutrition issues could become a </p><p>concern if protein sources and vegetables are not </p><p>obtainable.  The concerns of the camp residents concerning </p><p>their future options should be addressed by the UNHCR when </p><p>staff are allowed to return to Al Tash. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
