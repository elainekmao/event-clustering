<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000348 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AM, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH-ARMENIAN RECONCILIATION COMMISSION MEETS, </p><p>CONSIDERS CHANGES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Following a March 10 meeting to review and </p><p>discuss a report it had commissioned from the International </p><p>Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), members of the </p><p>Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission (TARC) have been </p><p>unable to reach agreement on how to deal with the contentious </p><p>"genocide" issue.  Moving forward, TARC may make some changes </p><p>in its composition and focus in order to overcome fundamental </p><p>differences that have hindered progress in its work to date. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission </p><p>(TARC) met in London on March 10 to review and discuss the </p><p>report it had commissioned in July 2002 from the </p><p>International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ).  The </p><p>ICTJ report, entitled "The Applicability of the U.N. </p><p>Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of </p><p>Genocide to Events Which Occurred During the Early Twentieth </p><p>Century," was sent to TARC members last month and has </p><p>subsequently been reprinted in the Turkish and Armenian </p><p>press.  Although the ICTJ report\'s explicitly legal nature </p><p>and narrow focus dramatically limit its implications, the </p><p>simple fact that both the Armenian and Turkish members of </p><p>TARC agreed to commission the ICTJ report is a positive </p><p>development.  The first half of the report indicates that "no </p><p>legal, financial, or territorial claim arising out of the </p><p>Events could successfully be made against any individual or </p><p>state under the Convention."  But the report continues in the </p><p>second half to note that the Events themselves could be said </p><p>"to include all of the elements of the crime of genocide as </p><p>defined in the Convention" (in other words, that the term </p><p>"genocide" can be applied to tragedy that befell the </p><p>Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The report has not received significant attention in </p><p>the Turkish press.  Former Ambassador and TARC member Gunduz </p><p>Aktan has publicly expressed his concern that the ICTJ\'s </p><p>conclusions might be taken out of context and interpreted as </p><p>a judgment on the Events themselves rather than a legal </p><p>opinion on the applicability of a legal definition.  He and </p><p>others have commented that because the term "genocide," as </p><p>legally defined by the Convention, can be applied to any </p><p>number of ethnic clashes, it has lost all practical meaning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On March 12, former Turkish Ambassador (also President </p><p>of the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation) Ozdem </p><p>Sanberk and Sabanci University Professor and former </p><p>Bosphorous University Rector Ustun Erguder (both TARC </p><p>members) told poloff separately that the March 10 meeting had </p><p>gone reasonably well.  Over the course of past meetings, </p><p>Sanberk and Erguder said that interpersonal dynamics between </p><p>the Turkish and Armenian participants have been good, </p><p>although they continue to have fundamental differences on the </p><p>key issue of "genocide."  (Note and Comment: Erguder had </p><p>earlier remarked to poloff that "one particular Turkish </p><p>member" had been offended and upset by the exchanges during </p><p>one of the sessions and that this had led to a long pause in </p><p>the TARC\'s activities.  Based on Erguder\'s comments, poloff </p><p>believes that he may have been referring to Gunduz Aktan. </p><p>End Note and Comment.)  Sanberk reported that there had been </p><p>"total disagreement," for example, on the ICTJ report, </p><p>particularly its second half.  Erguder told poloff that he </p><p>personally had found the ICTJ report to be fair and balanced, </p><p>but confirmed, however, that the only aspect the Commission </p><p>could agree on was to put the report behind them. Looking </p><p>forward, Sanberk and Erguder said that the TARC will continue </p><p>its work, but that there was a possibility that there might </p><p>be partial, or even total, changes in both the Armenian and </p><p>Turkish sides of the Commission.  Erguder added that he had </p><p>suggested that TARC abandon the "genocide" issue for now and </p><p>focus instead on promoting other people-to-people and civil </p><p>society activities.  He claimed that Armenian Assembly of </p><p>America Chairman Van Krikorian reacted favorably to this </p><p>proposal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: The TARC has had a rocky and difficult road, </p><p>particularly in weathering criticism from the Armenian </p><p>diaspora.  Sanberk and Erguder claim from their personal </p><p>experience that Turks have been far less critical than </p><p>Armenians of the TARC.  However, TARC\'s work is not widely </p><p>followed in Turkey.  At the same time, we are beginning to </p><p>hear such criticism in Istanbul as well.  Most recently, for </p><p>example, Kaan Soyak (please protect), the President of the </p><p>Turkish-Armenian Business Development Council (a commercial </p><p>group that also promotes people-to-people and commercial </p><p>activities), told poloff on March 8 that his contacts in both </p><p>the Armenian and Turkish communities are fed up with TARC and </p><p>are eager for "a new approach." </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
