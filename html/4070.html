<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001990 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-24-12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 148 (10-24-02) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Lewis Amselem, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  GAYOOM VISIT </p><p>           RODRIGO RECALL </p><p>           ICC </p><p> </p><p>GAYOOM VISIT </p><p>------------ </p><p>1.  (C) We have the following points for you to use </p><p>regarding President Gayoom\'s request for a meeting with </p><p>President Bush: </p><p> </p><p>-- In his almost 25 years in power, President Gayoom has </p><p>been very friendly to the U.S., and the Maldives has </p><p>consistently used OIC, UN, and other fora to stake out </p><p>moderate positions. </p><p> </p><p>-- Under Gayoom, the Maldives has been an eager member of </p><p>the international coalition against terrorism, </p><p>immediately condemning the September 11 terrorist attacks </p><p>and offering the U.S. any help it needed.  (Note:  This </p><p>may not seem like much now months after the horrendous </p><p>event, but right after September 11 it was something that </p><p>was deeply appreciated.) </p><p> </p><p>-- After September 11, for example, Gayoom allowed U.S. </p><p>forces blanket overflight and ship clearances.  This was </p><p>important as the Maldives lies due north of the U.S. base </p><p>at Diego Garcia. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Maldives could prove similarly helpful if military </p><p>action against Iraq proves unavoidable. </p><p> </p><p>-- As far as we are aware, no Maldivian leader has ever </p><p>met with a U.S. President since the country gained </p><p>independence from the UK in 1965.  In the run-up to the </p><p>Gulf War, then-Secretary Baker briefly stopped in Male to </p><p>rally support.  That was apparently the highest level </p><p>contact between the two countries.  As a friendly </p><p>country, the Maldivians -- in requesting a high-level </p><p>meeting -- clearly want to upgrade ties. </p><p> </p><p>-- Given these factors, we think that a meeting between </p><p>Gayoom and President Bush deserves very serious </p><p>consideration.  If the President is not available, we </p><p>would then suggest a meeting with the Vice President. </p><p> </p><p>-- While we understand that a meeting may not be </p><p>possible, we guarantee that the Maldivians -- who do not </p><p>request much from us -- will be hurt if we do not come up </p><p>with a good reason for a turn down of its request.  Any </p><p>hint that we are giving short shrift to the Maldives </p><p>because it is a small state will be noticed and resented. </p><p> </p><p>(POL) </p><p> </p><p>RODRIGO RECALL </p><p>-------------- </p><p>2.  (U) Per your o/i note, we have requested the dipnote </p><p>from the MFA withdrawing Nihal Rodrigo\'s name. (POL) </p><p> </p><p>ICC WAIVER </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  You\'ll see our front channel report on the latest </p><p>twist and turn in the ICC saga.  The MFA continues to put </p><p>on the stall.  Let us know ASAP Washington\'s views on the </p><p>latest proposal from the MFA; meanwhile, we\'re going to </p><p>take it up at the political level again. (DCM) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
