<p>S E C R E T ROME 002340 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CH, ETTC, IR, IT, PREL, EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>SUBJECT: ALENIA-SPAZIO AND CHINA:  DELIVERY OF A/S </p><p>BLOOMFIELD LETTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>    REF: STATE 138499 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) ECMIN, JOINED BY SCICOUNS, DELIVERED A/S BLOOMFIELD\'S </p><p>LETTER AND ACCOMPANYING NON-PAPER ON MAY 23 TO MFA DIRGEN FOR </p><p>ECONOMIC AFFAIRS GIANDOMENICO MAGLIANO.  ECMIN NOTED THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON OFFICIALS HAD APPRECIATED THE FEBRUARY APPROACH BY </p><p>GOI AND ITALIAN INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES, AND THAT USG </p><p>AGENCIES HAD REVIEWED THE PROPOSALS WITH GREAT CARE AND </p><p>DELIBERATION.  A/S BLOOMFIELD\'S LETTER REPRESENTED A </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE RESPONSE TO MOVE BEYOND PAST DISAGREEMENTS AND </p><p>MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND TO INITIATE A COOPERATIVE DIALOGUE ON </p><p>NON-PROLIFERATION CONCERNS.  SUCH A DIALOGUE COULD PAVE THE </p><p>WAY TO ENHANCED DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION WITH ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  ECMIN ALSO UNDERSCORED THAT WASHINGTON\'S RESPONSE </p><p>HAD BEEN FAVORABLY INFLUENCED BY HELPFUL ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE </p><p>GOI ON SPECIFIC EXPORT CONTROL ISSUES OF CONCERN TO THE USG, </p><p>SUCH AS THE DECISION TO HALT DELIVERY OF HIGH SPEED PATROL </p><p>BOATS TO IRAN.  SUCH ACTIONS WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO FOSTER </p><p>THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT FOR POSITIVE BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS </p><p>CONCERNING ALENIA AND CHINA.  FINALLY, ECMIN NOTED THAT THE </p><p>USG WAS PREPARED TO MOVE FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY WITH AD HOC </p><p>CONSULTATIONS, CONTINGENT ONLY ON GOI WRITTEN ASSURANCES THAT </p><p>ALENIA\'S TWO SATELLITE STUDIES FOR CHINA HAD CONCLUDED, AS WE </p><p>HAD BEEN TOLD WAS THE CASE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  AFTER READING THE LETTER AND NON-PAPER, MAGLIANO </p><p>OFFERED HIS PRELIMINARY REACTION THAT THEY DID REPRESENT A </p><p>    POSITIVE STEP FORWARD.  HE DID NOT FORECAST DIFFICULTY IN </p><p>PROVIDING THE REQUESTED WRITTEN ASSURANCES, BUT HE DID STRESS </p><p>THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO CONSULT CLOSELY ON ALL POINTS BOTH </p><p>WITHIN THE MFA AND WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  WITH RESPECT TO INITIATING AD HOC CONSULTATIONS, </p><p>MAGLIANO SAID HE HAD ALREADY GIVEN SOME THOUGHT TO HOLDING A </p><p>FIRST ROUND OF DISCUSSIONS IN JUNE.  IN THAT CONNECTION, HE </p><p>ASKED WHAT ROLE WE ENVISIONED FOR INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES IN </p><p>SUCH TALKS.  DRAWING UPON REFTEL PARA 5, ECMIN REPLIED THAT </p><p>WE FELT THE CONSULTATIONS SHOULD INITIALLY BE HELD ON A </p><p>GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT BASIS, BUT THAT </p><p>GOVERNMENT-TO-INDUSTRY TALKS MIGHT WELL BE A SENSIBLE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT STEP.  MAGLIANO QUESTIONED HOW FAR DISCUSSIONS </p><p>COULD PROCEED WITHOUT INVOLVING CONCERNED COMPANIES IN SOME </p><p>WAY.  HE SUGGESTED THAT THE FIRST CONSULTATIONS INCLUDE AT </p><p>LEAST TWO, BUT PREFERABLY THREE, SEPARATE SESSIONS:  1) </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ONLY;  2) GOVT REPS PLUS OUTSIDE </p><p>"INDEPENDENT" EXPERTS (I.E. FROM ACADEMIA OR NON-PROFIT </p><p>TECHNICAL INSTITUTES);  3) GOVT PLUS INDUSTRY REPS.  ECMIN </p><p>SAID HE WOULD CONVEY THIS SUGGESTION TO WASHINGTON. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02340 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
