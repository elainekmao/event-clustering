<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L NDJAMENA 000443 </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR EMBASSY KHARTOUM OFFICE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  02/06/08 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, CD, LY </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE CESS POOL: QADHAFI ORGANIZES THE NEIGHBORS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  NDJAMENA 402 AND PREVIOUS (ALL NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY D. HALSTED. REASON 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) PRESIDENT DEBY BROUGHT BACK FROM HIS FEBRUARY 3- </p><p>5 VISIT NEWS OF THE FORMATION OF THE COMMUNITY OF SAHEL- </p><p>SAHARA STATES (COMMUNAUTE DES ETATS SAHELO-SAHARIENS, OR </p><p>CESS).  CESS, ACCORDING TO DEBY\'S ANNOUNCEMENT, WOULD </p><p>APPEAR TO BE FIVE STATES: LIBYA, CHAD, NIGER, MALI, AND </p><p>SUDAN.  THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, BURKINA FASO, </p><p>TUNISIA AND EGYPT WERE OTHERS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>REPRESENTED AT THE TRIPOLI MEETING, AND MAY ALSO BE PART </p><p>OF THE NEW ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) DEBY SAID THE IDEA DATED BACK TO 1972.  CESS </p><p>WOULD BE FIRST AN ECONOMIC GROUPING, THEN LATER A </p><p>POLITICAL ASSOCIATION, GIVING A GROUP OF LANDLOCKED </p><p>STATES OCEAN FRONTAGE.  UNITY THEMES FIGURED IN HIS </p><p>DESCRIPTION: "AT A TIME WHEN IMPORTANT GROUPS ARE BEING </p><p>FORMED IN EUROPE AND ASIA, WE HAVE A DUTY, AS AFRICANS, </p><p>TO DEVELOP THE REALITY OF TOTAL AFRICAN INTEGRATION." </p><p>CESS IS TO FOCUS ON ECONOMIC COOPERATION IN AGRICULTURE, </p><p>INDUSTRY, ENERGY, COMMERCE AND FINANCE.  PROVISIONAL </p><p>HEADQUARTERS WILL BE IN TRIPOLI, WITH LIBYAN MAHDI </p><p>AZHARI AS EXECEUTIVE SECRETARY AND CHADIAN ADOUM TOGOI </p><p>AS HIS DEPUTY.  QADHAFI WAS NAMED PROVISIONAL PRESIDENT </p><p>OF CESS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT.  CESS IS NOT LIKELY TO AMOUNT TO MUCH, </p><p>AT LEAST WHERE CHAD IS CONCERNED.  IT MAY PROMPT SOME </p><p>DEBATE AS ANY AGREEMENT WILL PROBABLY BE REVIEWED BY THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  CHAD WOULD GO TO CONSIDERABLE </p><p>LENGTHS TO ACCOMODATE QADHAFI, WHO IS GENERALLY REGARDED </p><p>WITHIN CHAD\'S RULING GROUP AS A MENACE.  UNDER BETTER </p><p>CONDITIONS, CHAD WOULD HAVE A GENUINE INTEREST IN A </p><p>ROUTE TO THE MEDITERRANEAN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENT </p><p>TRANSPORTATION ARRANGEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT ADOUM TOGOI SOLVES ANY </p><p>MYSTERY OF WHERE HE WENT AFTER HIS NAME SURFACED AS A </p><p>COUP PLOTTER AGAINST DEBY.  ALREADY A LEGEND FOR HIS </p><p>PRO-LIBYAN SYMPATHIES, TOGOI LOST HIS JOB AS CHAD\'S </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO LIBYA WHEN HE GOT INTO A FIST FIGHT IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 1996 YEAR WITH THEN-FOREIGN MINISTER KEBZABO </p><p>OVER DIFFERENCES ABOUT LIBYAN POLICY, ALL RIGHT IN FRONT </p><p>OF A VISITING LIBYAN DELEGATION.  DEBY GAVE HIM A JOB AT </p><p>THE PRESIDENCY SO HE COULD KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.  TOGOI </p><p>WAS REMOVED FROM THAT JOB LAST NOVEMBER, AND THERE </p><p>ENSUED - FOR THIS REASON AND EVIDENTLY OTHERS - THE </p><p>CHALLENGE TO DEBY\'S LEADERSHIP FROM FELLOW ZAGHAWAS </p><p>(REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HALSTED </p><p></p></div>
