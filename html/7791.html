<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000817 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DECL: 05/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EPET, PINS, MOPS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA - SSS DIRECTOR ON THE ELECTION AND </p><p>THE SITUATION IN WARRI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During an April 30 meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, the Director General of the State Security </p><p>Service (SSS) Kayode Are said that all political </p><p>parties had committed electoral fraud.  He also </p><p>asserted that the outcome of the Presidential contest </p><p>was a genuine reflection of the actual vote, albeit </p><p>the margin of victory may have been inflated. </p><p>However, Are acknowledged that the results of some </p><p>gubernatorial and National Assembly contests were </p><p>egregious.  Overall, Are thought the elections were </p><p>adequate under current circumstances but stated that </p><p>Nigeria will have to experience several iterations </p><p>before nailing down the process of conducting </p><p>elections properly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Are stated that a political party manipulated </p><p>the results in areas where it was in control.  While </p><p>most of the outcry was against the PDP for alleged </p><p>fraud, Are claimed receiving credible reports of </p><p>significant electoral manipulation by the ANPP in </p><p>several Northern states.  He acknowledged misconduct </p><p>in the South-South had been too brazen; voter turnouts </p><p>were too astronomical to believe.  However, that was </p><p>nothing new in the riverine areas.  In every previous </p><p>election, the South-South has always produced grossly </p><p>exaggerated figures.  In actuality, most communities </p><p>in that area did not hold elections.  Community </p><p>leaders would simply assembly and decide how to </p><p>allocate the community\'s votes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Turning his attention to press reports of the </p><p>house arrest of ANPP Presidential candidate Muhammadu </p><p>Buhari, Are said the reports were false.  At no time </p><p>was Buhari\'s freedom of movement abridged.  Instead, </p><p>the police stopped the ANPP from holding political </p><p>rallies in Katsina State because the party had not </p><p>applied for the required permits.  Are commented that </p><p>the ANPP was trying to provoke an encounter with the </p><p>police by holding a rally without a permit.  However, </p><p>the police had been instructed not use force to quash </p><p>the rally.  Are conjectured that the report of </p><p>Buhari\'s house arrest was of the same family of </p><p>inaccuracies - an intentional fabrication meant to </p><p>incite anger and perhaps violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON WARRI </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Are said that the use of military force </p><p>against Ijaw militants in Warri was more a question of </p><p>"when" not "if."  His advice had been to commence </p><p>action prior to the May 29 inauguration but some </p><p>political advisors of the President were counseling to </p><p>wait after the inauguration.  Are also mentioned that </p><p>the GON had felt hamstrung in dealing with the crisis </p><p>due to the Ambassador\'s recent advice to the President </p><p>not to repeat in Warria what had happened in Odi and </p><p>Benue. However, at the end of the day, the GON </p><p>realized that it had to act or else relinquish control </p><p>of that strategic area around Warri to the reckless </p><p>Ijaw militants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
