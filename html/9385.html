KUWAIT 3044 </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 2992 </p><p>     C. STATE 196163 </p><p>     D. STATE 186972 </p><p>     E. STATE 71056 </p><p>     F. KUWAIT 1221 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) In initial courtesy calls, in-coming Econ Chief met on </p><p>28 June with Ministry of Finance U/S Abdul Mohsen Al-Hunaif </p><p>and Dep U/S Mustafa Shamali; on 30 June with Kuwait Stock </p><p>Exchange Technical Chief Wafa Al-Rashid; and on 1 July with </p><p>Banking supervisors Abdul-Aziz Al-Bader and Abdullah Al-Sabah </p><p>of the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) for general discussions </p><p>regarding GOK activities in support of UNSCR 1483, earlier </p><p>resolutions, and actions of the UN 661 Iraq Sanctions </p><p>Committee. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) CBK officials on 1 July confirmed receipt of Ref D </p><p>letter from Treasury Secretary Snow and informed us that </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, in conjunction with </p><p>the Ministry of Finance, would conduct a review of GOK </p><p>actions thus far in support of terrorist finance </p><p>interdiction.  Subsequently, ECON provided the Ministries of </p><p>Finance and Foreign Affairs copies of the Treasury letter and </p><p>renewed our earlier request (Ref E) for an update on the </p><p>specifics of GOK\'s finance interdiction activities. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ECON delivered Ref C demarche and talking points to </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 10 July and subsequently to </p><p>the appropriate offices of the CBK and the Ministry of </p><p>Finance.  The accompanying diplomatic note reiterated earlier </p><p>requests for an update on Kuwait\'s finance interdiction </p><p>program.  Our interlocutors cited the recent National </p><p>Assembly elections concluded on 5 July and the current </p><p>reorganization of Government as factors that have delayed </p><p>GOK\'s review and update of Kuwait\'s actions to date in the </p><p>interdiction of terrorist financing. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Comment.  We sense no reluctance on the part of our </p><p>interlocutors to provide the promised review of Kuwait\'s </p><p>activities in support of UNSCR 1483, earlier resolutions, and </p><p>actions of the UN 661 Iraq Sanctions Committee.  The National </p><p>Assembly elections indeed have brought some changes (Refs A </p><p>and B) in the political line up that inevitably will affect </p><p>who does what regarding the War on Terrorism, which </p><p>understandably is a raised profile issue here.  Additionally, </p><p>the GOK recently re-organized key elements for its financial </p><p>house supervision.  Within the past six weeks, the GOK has </p><p>promulgated Law 30 amending the 1968 Law 32 to bring the </p><p>"Islamic Banks" under Central Bank supervision as if they </p><p>were regular commercial operations; the Kuwaiti interagency </p><p>Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Committee </p><p>was organized formally; and the Finance Ministry transferred </p><p>control of the Financial Intelligence Unit to the Central </p><p>Bank from the Ministry of Justice.  We expect the </p><p>bureaucratic dust of the elections and the supervisory units\' </p><p>reorganization to settle soon and will encourage our </p><p>interlocutors to bring us up-to-date immediately thereafter. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
