<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004787 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH PARLIAMENT PASSES "RE-INTEGRATION" LAW FOR </p><p>PKK/KADEK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4499 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4682 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires a.i. Robert S. Deutsch. </p><p>Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) This is an action request.  See paras 9 and 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Parliament by a vote of 356 to 71 (there were 123 </p><p>no-shows) passed the GOT\'s "re-integration" law for PKK/KADEK </p><p>militants.  During the debate, AK M.P. Ahmet Isik stated that </p><p>the law comes in the context of the AK Government\'s wider </p><p>emphasis on democratization and human rights generally.  On </p><p>behalf of the opposition CHP, Antalya deputy Tuncay Ercenk </p><p>argued that "it is impossible" for CHP to vote for the law, </p><p>which he criticized as disrupting social peace; he also </p><p>stressed that the USG had "ordered" what was in effect an </p><p>outright "amnesty" for terrorists.  CHP M.P. Onur Oymen, a </p><p>retired senior Ambassador and former MFA Undersecretary, went </p><p>further in claiming that to support the law would be to </p><p>succumb to U.S. pressure.  Oymen accused the USG of a double </p><p>standard on terrorism and indifference to Turkish interests, </p><p>implying that the U.S. is tough on al-Qaida but soft on </p><p>PKK/KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Privately, just before the vote July 29, AK Erzurum </p><p>M.P. Ibrahim Ozdogan, an ethnic Turk, offered to us that the </p><p>law would be a welcome sign of intent to heal social </p><p>divisions in Turkey, though he expressed skepticism that the </p><p>law would be applied in a way sufficiently liberal to work. </p><p>Moreover, he added that President Sezer\'s view of the law </p><p>could be key.  The President, Ozdogan noted, has long been </p><p>extremely sensitive to anything that in his view could </p><p>threaten the national or territorial integrity of Turkey </p><p>(note: presumably, in Sezer\'s view, by letting the PKK/KADEK </p><p>off the hook. end note).  It remains an open question whether </p><p>Sezer will veto the law, Ozdogan said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In a private conversation with us July 29, Sami </p><p>Selcuk, former President of the High Court of Appeals and a </p><p>leading reformist voice, characterized the law as a positive </p><p>and long-overdue step.  However, he was guarded about the </p><p>prospects that it would actually induce PKK/KADEK militants </p><p>to give up their arms, emphasizing that as with other reforms </p><p>implementation will be crucial to any success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In a separate pre-vote meeting at Embassy, Veli </p><p>Buyuksahin, Vice Chairman of DEHAP (Sinn Fein to PKK/KADEK) </p><p>reiterated to us the view shared by Kurdish contacts across </p><p>the political spectrum: the law will not bring significant </p><p>numbers of militants down from the mountains (reftel).  He </p><p>noted that a senior DEHAP delegation -- including Chairman </p><p>Tuncer Bakirhan and Diyarbakir mayor Feridun Celik -- would </p><p>like to travel to N. Iraq to meet with PKK/KADEK </p><p>representatives and others there.  According to Buyuksahin, </p><p>DEHAP has run the idea by AK officials, including Interior </p><p>Minister Abdulkadir Aksu (an ethnic Kurd) and Justice </p><p>Minister/Government Spokesman Cemil Cicek.  Buyuksahin said </p><p>that the AK officials were non-committal: "They were neither </p><p>positive nor negative" regarding the plan.  He noted, </p><p>however, that the Turkish State Establishment likely would </p><p>have a decidedly more hostile view, but asserted nevertheless </p><p>that the PKK/KADEK must be considered an interlocutor in the </p><p>interests of social peace.  He allowed that there is an </p><p>element of domestic political theater in DEHAP\'s initiative. </p><p>We told Buyuksahin that we would not facilitate permission or </p><p>security for travel to Iraq and reiterated the U.S. view of </p><p>the PKK/KADEK as a terrorist organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) We note that the law appears to reinstate full </p><p>political rights to those who turn themselves in -- and do </p><p>not in the final analysis wind up behind bars; as always the </p><p>key lies in precisely how the law will be given practical </p><p>effect by the judicial system.  In this context, it is worth </p><p>noting the possibility that the law could apply to other, </p><p>non-PKK/KADEK terrorists -- again depending on interpretation </p><p>and implementation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The law now goes to President Sezer for consideration. </p><p> Sezer has 15 days to deliberate, after which he must either </p><p>sign or veto the legislation.  In the event of a veto, it </p><p>returns to Parliament for further action.  Under normal </p><p>circumstances, if Parliament passes and re-submits to Sezer </p><p>an unchanged law, the President must sign.  There is a </p><p>wrinkle, however.  As reported ref B, Parliament by-laws </p><p>dictate that laws "in the nature of an amnesty" require a </p><p>qualified majority (330 of 550 seats), which was achieved </p><p>July 29 but may not be easy to duplicate given: 1) that a </p><p>legislative recess begins the end of this week; 2) Sezer\'s </p><p>notorious penchant for using vetoes and other slow-ball </p><p>tactics to obstruct AK legislative and other actions; and 3) </p><p>the ever-present possibility of emerging "provocations" that </p><p>could color the political atmosphere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Action Requests </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) While the law is not perfect, it provides a overture </p><p>to PKK/KADEK members interested in abandoning the armed </p><p>struggle and returning to normal Turkish society.  It </p><p>represents an opportunity to move ahead on the problem both </p><p>in northern Iraq and Turkey.  We therefore offer the </p><p>following press guidance for use by Washington officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin press guidance: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The Turkish Parliament today passed legislation to </p><p>encourage members of the PKK/KADEK to lay down their arms, </p><p>return to Turkey, and reintegrate themselves into a Turkish </p><p>society in the midst of a wide-ranging and comprehensive </p><p>reform process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The United States welcomes the Parliament\'s action as an </p><p>important step forward toward ending the threat posed to </p><p>Turkey by the PKK/KADEK, and we encourage members of those </p><p>organizations to take advantage of Turkey\'s offer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The United States remains committed to working with Turkey </p><p>to eliminate the PKK/KADEK presence in Iraq, and to ensure </p><p>that a free Iraq does not serve as a sanctuary for terrorists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End press guidance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Action requests, continued: now that the long </p><p>anticipated "re-integration" law has been enacted, we need to </p><p>proceed with our commitments on ending the terrorist safe </p><p>haven in Iraq.  We recommend immediate consultations with the </p><p>Turks on coordinating info operations that will convince as </p><p>many PKK/KADEK members as possible to take advantage of the </p><p>new law.  In addition, we need to exchange intel on PKK/KADEK </p><p>presence in Iraq in order to prepare our activities.  Embassy </p><p>recommends that CENTCOM send a team to Ankara as soon as </p><p>possible to conduct these consultations.  We stand ready to </p><p>provide all possible assistance. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
