<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 005539 </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY HANOI FOR PAUL BERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 6/19/21 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PTER, PGOV, PREL, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC ANNOUNCE INTENTION TO RELEASE ADDITIONAL 250 </p><p>SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN/CONTINUE TO KIDNAP AND EXTORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: BOGOTA 5460 </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) CLASSIFIED BY CDA BARBARA C. MOORE, REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON JUNE 18, THE FARC RELEASED AN ADDITIONAL GROUP </p><p>OF COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN, BRINGING THE TOTAL OF </p><p>RELEASED IN THE FIRST HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE TO 55.  GOC </p><p>PEACE COMMISSIONER CAMILO GOMEZ ADMITTED TO THE PRESS THAT </p><p>THE FARC HAD NOT ALLOWED THE ICRC TO GIVE MEDICAL EXAMS TO </p><p>THE CAPTURED SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN, THUS VIOLATING A KEY </p><p>ASPECT OF THE HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE AGREEMENT.  INSTEAD, </p><p>THE FARC REPORTEDLY CONDUCTED THE MEDICAL EXAMS </p><p>THEMSELVES.  THE PRESS REPORTS THAT THREE OF THE MOST </p><p>SERIOUSLY ILL POLICEMEN/SOLDIERS WERE NOT RELEASED (TWO </p><p>REPORTEDLY SUFFER FROM SERIOUS FORMS OF CANCER), WHILE </p><p>MANY OF THE RELEASED WERE IN GOOD HEALTH.  GOC PEACE </p><p>NEGOTIATOR LUIS GUILLERMO GIRALDO (PROTECT) TOLD POLOFF ON </p><p>JUNE 19 THAT HE AND OTHERS IN THE GOC SUSPECT THAT THE </p><p>FARC IS KEEPING THE THREE SERIOUSLY ILL SOLDIERS/POLICEMEN </p><p>TO INCREASE PUBLIC PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO NEGOTIATE A </p><p>POLICEMEN/SOLDIERS FOR GUERRILLA SWAP, MUCH LIKE THEY HAD </p><p>TRIED TO DO WITH THE CASE OF GRAVELY ILL POLICE COL. </p><p>ACOSTA.  GIRALDO AFFIRMED THAT THE FARC STRATEGY IS TO </p><p>CONVINCE THE GOC TO HAVE SIMULTANEOUS, PERMANENT SWAPS SO </p><p>AS TO (IN THEIR VIEW) RAISE THEIR INTERNATIONAL COMBATANT </p><p>STATUS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON JUNE 19 THE FARC CENTRAL COMMAND ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>THEY WILL UNILATERALLY LIBERATE AN ADDITIONAL 250 SOLDIERS </p><p>AND POLICEMEN ON JUNE 28, AND INVITED THE COLOMBIAN POLICE </p><p>AND ARMED FORCES TO BE PRESENT WHEN THE RELEASE TAKES </p><p>PLACE "AS A GESTURE OF SOLIDARITY."  GIRALDO TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT THE FARC FEEL A SIMULTANEOUS, PERMANENT EXCHANGE </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH THE GOC WOULD BENEFIT THEM AND UNDERMINE </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES IN THREE WAYS: ONE, SINCE </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES HIERARCHY HAS EXPRESSED </p><p>OPPOSITION TO AN EXCHANGE AGREEMENT PUBLICLY, A GOC </p><p>DECISION TO ACQUIESCE TO THE FARC ON THIS ISSUE WOULD </p><p>CREATE FURTHER CIVIL-MILITARY TENSIONS; SECONDLY, SOLDIERS </p><p>AND POLICEMEN WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO SURRENDER IN THE </p><p>BATTLEFIELD RATHER THAN FIGHT IF THEY KNOW THEY WILL BE </p><p>SWAPPED QUICKLY, AND, THIRD, THE FARC WOULD BE ABLE TO </p><p>QUICKLY REPLENISH THEIR DEPLETED MID-LEVEL BATTLEFIELD </p><p>CADRES.  GIRALDO ADDED THAT THE FARC HAS SHOWN NO INTEREST </p><p>IN MOVING FROM THE HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE AGREEMENT TO A </p><p>DISCUSSION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW OR </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS TO DECREASE THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE, MUCH LESS </p><p>A CEASE FIRE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SEPARATELY, ON JUNE 12 LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATE HORACIO SERPA AND LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENT LUIS </p><p>GUILLERMO VELEZ TOLD POLOFFS THAT LIBERAL SENATOR LUIS </p><p>ELADIO PEREZ BONILLA HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED THREE DAYS EARLIER </p><p>IN NARINO DEPARTMENT, REPORTEDLY BY THE FARC.  SINCE THAT </p><p>TIME, PEREZ\'S KIDNAPPING HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, WITH ALL </p><p>INDICATIONS LEADING TO THE FARC.  IN ADDITION, VELEZ </p><p>STATED ON JUNE 17 THAT HE HAS BEEN WARNED BY THE FARC THAT </p><p>HE MUST EITHER PAY A "WAR TAX" ("VACUNA") OR BE A </p><p>KIDNAPPING TARGET. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C)  COMMENT:  DESPITE THE HOPES RAISED BY THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>EXCHANGE AND POSSIBLE FOLLOW-UP UNILATERAL RELEASE OF </p><p>SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN, THE FARC CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT </p><p>THEY ARE NOT YET INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING WITH THE GOC THE </p><p>KINDS OF ISSUES THAT WOULD GENUINELY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF </p><p>VIOLENCE OR MOVE TOWARDS EVENTUAL RESOLUTION OF THE </p><p>CONFLICT.  INSTEAD, THEIR RECENT ACTIONS -- DISREGARD FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE GROUND RULES, KIDNAPPING OF SEN. </p><p>PEREZ, AND THE AUDACIOUS THREAT AGAINST THE LIBERAL PARTY </p><p>PRESIDENT -- DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF ARROGANCE MOST </p><p>COLOMBIANS ARE ALL TOO USED TO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MOORE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
