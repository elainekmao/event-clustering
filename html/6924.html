Papers speculate that U.S. forces will </p><p>march on Baghdad from the north within one month. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" reports that Secretary Rumsfeld stressed that </p><p>the landing should be seen as an action that will assure </p><p>that Iraq remains intact.  Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi </p><p>phoned his Turkish counterpart on Wednesday to explore </p><p>possibilities for cooperation to cope with a possible </p><p>refugee crisis.  "Radikal" reports that Prime Minister </p><p>Erdogan is complaining about ongoing pressure for deployment </p><p>of U.S. troops in Turkey, but said that his government would </p><p>not yield to pressure.  Papers also report that Spanish </p><p>Foreign Minister Palacio `threatened\' Turkey, saying that </p><p>Spain would consider new policies toward Ankara on certain </p><p>issues if Turkey deploys troops in Northern Iraq.  The </p><p>National Security Council (NSC) will convene on Friday to </p><p>discuss the war and developments in Iraq.  The NSC will </p><p>evaluate anti-Turkish sentiment in the U.S. and Europe over </p><p>alleged secret Turkish deployment plans for Northern Iraq, </p><p>and will shape a policy to counter such accusations.  Press </p><p>op-eds predict that the U.S. will ask for full cooperation </p><p>from Turkey if coalition forces continue to have trouble in </p><p>Iraq.  The Americans blame Turkey for their failure thus </p><p>far, but at the same time recognize that launching the </p><p>attack without Turkey\'s support has been a mistake, </p><p>according to the reports.  Papers report Deputy Secretary of </p><p>Defense Wolfowitz saying at a House of Representatives </p><p>hearing that Turkey has suffered financial loss by denying </p><p>access to U.S. troops, but could still realize economic </p><p>gains in the medium term.  Wolfowitz defended the $8.5 </p><p>billion financial aid proposal for Turkey, stressing that </p><p>Ankara has contributed a great deal by granting </p><p>unconditional overflight rights to coalition aircraft.  Iraq </p><p>will be a highly profitable market for Turkey once things </p><p>become normalized, Wolfowitz added.  Papers also report </p><p>SecState Powell\'s defense of Turkey at a House </p><p>Appropriations Committee hearing.  Powell praised the GOT </p><p>for taking the `troops decree\' to parliament on March 1 </p><p>despite public opposition.  Meanwhile NGOs, unions, and </p><p>political parties rallied in Istanbul Thursday to protest </p><p>the war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Retrial of jailed Kurdish politicians: A State Security </p><p>Court (SSC) on Friday began the retrial of four Kurdish </p><p>politicians of the closed Democracy Party (DEP), who have </p><p>been in jail for the past nine years.  The four former </p><p>parliamentarians - Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan and </p><p>Selim Sadak - were given 15-year jail sentences in 1994 for </p><p>alleged links to the outlawed PKK.  Zana had caused tension </p><p>in parliament by taking part of her oath in Kurdish.  EU </p><p>observers, journalists, and human rights activists are </p><p>expected to observe the hearings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  War in Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"From Vietnam to Iraq" </p><p>Hincal Uluc commented in mass appeal Sabah (3/28): "Anyone </p><p>who wishes for a `humanitarian\' war is living in a fantasy </p><p>world.  There is no such thing as a humanitarian war.  The </p><p>US should hasten to finish the job in Iraq, yet it seems </p><p>impossible because of the failure of its early-stage </p><p>planning and predictions. . US intelligence has obviously </p><p>failed in the Iraq war, so the American administration is </p><p>now sending positive messages to Ankara once again.  . The </p><p>failure of the American war strategy, based on faulty </p><p>intelligence, has deadlocked for the US administration.  The </p><p>only way to capture Iraq is to wipe out the capital city. </p><p>The US is capable of doing that with its military </p><p>technology. The question is how to make this digestable to </p><p>the American public and to the world.  . On the other hand, </p><p>Saddam\'s war strategy is based on defending Baghdad until </p><p>the bitter end, and US forces should expect strong </p><p>resistance there.  Baghdad will be the most challenging part </p><p>of the war.  Given factors such as the climate and Iraqi </p><p>resistance, the longer the battle for Baghdad lasts, the </p><p>more the Bush administration will suffer politically.  It </p><p>may even lead to events which could signal the end of the </p><p>Bush era." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Losing by winning" </p><p>Fatih Altayli argued in mass appeal Hurriyet (3/28): "In a </p><p>war situation, the time factor always poses disadvantages to </p><p>the occupying force.  . Another vital factor for the </p><p>occupying force is to be able to capture the main target at </p><p>the peak point of the war.  In the Iraq war, this means </p><p>capturing Baghdad.  This has not yet happened.  Evidently </p><p>the US does not have enough forces to pursue this peak point </p><p>yet.  The CentCom Command is now asking for an additional </p><p>three brigades, which will take time.  This will favor the </p><p>Iraqi regime.  The time factor is creating a dilemma for US </p><p>forces.  The only way to eliminate the time risk is to </p><p>conduct the battle with increased rage and violence. </p><p>However, this option would only create another obstacle for </p><p>the US by outraging the people of Iraq and the world.  It </p><p>seems that although the US may win the war, it will be on </p><p>the losing side in the longer run.  As for Iraq, it has been </p><p>on the losing side ever since Saddam began ruling the </p><p>country." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
