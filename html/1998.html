REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) EU ACTING CHIEF OF MISSION ALEX KREMER, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>BRUSSELS-BASED EU STAFFER TIM SHEEHY, DESCRIBED TO POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF ON SEPTEMBER 17 THE HEADACHES EXPERIENCED BY THE EU </p><p>IN TRYING TO GET A NINE-PERSON TECHNICAL TEAM ON THE GROUND TO LAY </p><p>THE GROUNDWORK FOR A SUSTAINED ELECTION OBSERVATION EFFORT. </p><p>ACCORDING TO KREMER, THE EU MISSION IN HARARE INFORMED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE IN A NOTE VERBALE ON SEPTEMBER 14 THAT THE </p><p>TEAM WOULD BE ARRIVING ON SEPTEMBER 23, AND PROVIDED THE TEAM\'S </p><p>TERMS OF REFERENCE.  KREMER RECEIVED A POLITE BUT FIRM LETTER IN </p><p>RESPONSE FROM DEPUTY PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN GEORGE CHARAMBA </p><p>STATING THAT THE EU SHOULD WAIT TO SEND ELECTION OBSERVERS UNTIL </p><p>IT IS INVITED TO DO SO.  CHARAMBA OFFERED NO DETAILS ON WHEN THE </p><p>EU MIGHT EXPECT SUCH AN INVITATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE FOREIGN MINISTRY\'S DIVISION DIRECTOR FOR EUROPE AND </p><p>THE AMERICAS JONATHAN WUTAWUNASHE ASKED TO SPEAK WITH KREMER AND </p><p>THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR ON SEPTEMBER 17 TO DISCUSS THE MATTER </p><p>FURTHER.  WUTAWUNASHE REPORTEDLY SAID THE GOZ DOES NOT OBJECT "IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE" TO EU ELECTION SUPPORT, BUT EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>LANGUAGE IN THE EU\'S NOTE VERBALE AND TERMS OF REFERENCE RAISED </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TEAM\'S REAL OBJECTIVES.  THE MFA OFFICIAL </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT THE EU SEND ANOTHER NOTE VERBALE PROPOSING THE </p><p>VISIT OF THE TEAM AND SUGGESTING A DISCUSSION OF ITS TERMS OF </p><p>REFERENCE.  KREMER TOLD US THAT THE EU PLANS TO PROCEED ALONG THE </p><p>LINES SUGGESTED BY WUTAWUNASHE.  ASKED WHETHER THE EU CONSIDERED </p><p>THIS THE END OF THE ROAD FOR ITS ELECTION OBSERVATION EFFORT, </p><p>SHEEHY SAID NO, BUT HE FULLY EXPECTED THE GOZ TO ERECT ALL SORTS </p><p>OF OBSTACLES, ENSURING THAT NO OBSERVERS ARE ADMITTED UNTIL MUCH </p><p>CLOSER TO THE DATES OF THE ELECTION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02760  200502Z </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WE AGREE WITH KREMER THAT THE GOZ WILL MAKE ALL PROPOSED </p><p>OBSERVER GROUPS -- PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM WESTERN GOVERNMENTS AND </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS -- JUMP THROUGH A NUMBER OF INCREASINGLY NARROW </p><p>HOOPS IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION.  THE GOZ\'S LIKELY GOAL IS TO </p><p>PREVENT OUTSIDE GROUPS FROM WITNESSING THE PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION THAT IS ALREADY A FACT OF LIFE FOR MANY </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS, AND TO ALLOW THEM IN AT THE LAST MINUTE, JUST IN TIME </p><p>TO PUT THEIR STAMP OF APPROVAL ON THE VOTING DAYS THEMSELVES, </p><p>WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN PEACEFUL.  THUS IT IS IMPORTANT TO </p><p>KEEP THE PRESSURE ON, AND WE WILL PRESS THE GOZ FOR A RESPONSE TO </p><p>OUR SEPTEMBER 13 DIPLOMATIC NOTE REGARDING THE IFES TEAM\'S </p><p>EXPULSION (REFTELS) BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
