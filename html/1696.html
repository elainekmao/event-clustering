IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) BELOW ARE EMBASSY HARARE\'S RESPONSES TO REF A </p><p>TASKING QUESTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>A.  (C) IT IS OUR ASSESSMENT THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS NO </p><p>LONGER SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A DEAL WITH THE OPPOSITION </p><p>MDC THAT WOULD INCLUDE HIS EARLY RETIREMENT.  (REF D </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT LATE LAST YEAR MUGABE PUT OUT FEELERS TO </p><p>THE OPPOSITION FOR SOME KIND OF POWER-SHARING OR </p><p>RETIREMENT DEAL.)  WE BELIEVE THAT IF THE MDC LEADERSHIP </p><p>APPROACHED MUGABE NOW WITH SUCH AN OFFER, HE WOULD </p><p>PROBABLY REJECT IT OUT OF HAND.  MUGABE IS DETERMINED TO </p><p>WIN ANOTHER TERM AND IS CONVINCED HE CAN DO IT. </p><p>MASVINGO "SUPREMO" EDDISON ZVOBGO TOLD US MAY 10 THAT </p><p>THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD INDUCE MUGABE TO LEAVE OFFICE </p><p>EARLY WOULD BE FOR A NUMBER OF PROMINENT ZANU-PF </p><p>STALWARTS TO PUBLICLY STAND UP TO MUGABE AND TELL HIM HE </p><p>MUST GO.  IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, WE FIND THIS </p><p>SCENARIO HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT </p><p>CONCEIVE OF ANY CONDITIONS THAT MUGABE WOULD VOLUNTARILY </p><p>ACCEPT THAT WOULD INDUCE HIM TO ABANDON HIS RE-ELECTION </p><p>BID.  HOWEVER, ZANU-PF IS STILL DIVIDED OVER THE </p><p>DESIRABILITY OF RETAINING MUGABE AS ITS CANDIDATE.  THE </p><p>SMALL COTERIE OF HARDLINERS SURROUNDING MUGABE, SUCH AS </p><p>INFORMATION MINISTER MOYO AND VICE-PRESIDENTS MSIKA AND </p><p>MUZENDA, WISH TO SEE MUGABE RUN AGAIN, BUT MANY IN THE </p><p>PARTY BELIEVE IT WILL BE ZANU-PF\'S UNDOING.  REFORM- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01585  111109Z </p><p>MINDED MEMBERS, SUCH AS FINANCE MINISTER MAKONI AND </p><p>FORMER HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER DUMISO DABENGWA, WOULD </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY LIKE TO SEE MUGABE BOW OUT OF THE RACE, AND </p><p>WOULD LIKELY SUPPORT A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT BEFORE </p><p>OR AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>B.  (C) WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CREDIBLE REPORTS OF </p><p>MUGABE ACTIVELY MOVING PERSONAL OR STATE ASSETS OUT OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  IN FACT, MUGABE HAS NEARLY FINISHED A NEW </p><p>MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR MANSION -- MOSTLY FINANCED BY ZANU- </p><p>PF -- IN THE BORROWDALE SUBURB OF HARARE, A SIGN HE </p><p>INTENDS TO STAY FOR SOME TIME.  ON THE OTHER HAND, LATE </p><p>LAST YEAR, WE WERE TOLD BY INDEPENDENT SOURCES THAT </p><p>FURNITURE BELONGING TO THE PRESIDENT WAS SEEN BOXED UP </p><p>AT HARARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT EN ROUTE TO EITHER LIBYA </p><p>OR EUROPE.  THIS STORY FALLS IN THE CATEGORY OF RUMOR, </p><p>HOWEVER, AND IS NOT A FIRM INDICATION OF MUGABE </p><p>INTENDING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY PERMANENTLY.  WE DO HEAR </p><p>STORIES OF SENIOR GOVERNMENT AND PARTY OFFICIALS LOOKING </p><p>FOR SCHOOLS IN THE U.S. INTO WHICH THEY CAN PLACE THEIR </p><p>CHILDREN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, AN INDICATOR THAT </p><p>THEY THINK THE SITUATION WILL WORSEN.  TO PAY FOR THIS, </p><p>THERE MUST BE SOME ASSET MOVEMENT OUT OF THE COUNTRY. </p><p>IN ADDITION, THE BRITISH AIRWAYS FLIGHTS TO LONDON ARE </p><p>ALWAYS FULL, AND PEOPLE BOARDING THEM SEEM TO BE IN </p><p>POSSESSION OF MUCH MORE THAN ORDINARY LUGGAGE. </p><p> </p><p>C.  (C) AS FOR THE MDC, IT CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY </p><p>CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BUT IN A MORE </p><p>LOW-KEY STYLE, AND IT TAKES PAINS TO AVOID ANTAGONIZING </p><p>ZANU-PF (SEE REFS B AND C FOR DETAILS ON THE MDC\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01585  111109Z </p><p>STRATEGY.)  IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THE MDC WOULD REACT TO A </p><p>MUGABE VICTORY:  MANY IN THE PARTY STILL HAVE NOT </p><p>SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED THIS POSSIBILITY AND THERE DOES NOT </p><p>YET APPEAR TO BE A CONTINGENCY PLAN IN PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
