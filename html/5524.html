<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000252 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR IIP/G/AF - DOWLING </p><p>INFO AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DAILY NEWS BASES ARTICLE ON WASHINGTON FILE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The privately owned "Daily News" published an </p><p>      article in its February 5, 2003 edition that was based </p><p>      on two Washington File articles (AEF501 and AEF504) </p><p>      from January 31.  The page-4 article was published </p><p>      under the title "Mubako admits crisis man-made" and </p><p>      acknowledged the "Washington File" as the source for </p><p>      the information.  The article offered readers </p><p>      information about how their Ambassador to the US </p><p>      defended Zimbabwean policies at the January 29 U.S. </p><p>      Institute of Peace program on "What Future for Mugabe\'s </p><p>      Zimbabwe." </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Economic and political pressures in Zimbabwe tend </p><p>      to deprive average citizens of information from outside </p><p>      of the country.  The Washington File\'s reporting on </p><p>      Zimbabwe-related events in the U.S. help penetrate the </p><p>      news "cone of silence" in which many Zimbabweans </p><p>      languish.  We are grateful for the two Washington File </p><p>      stories cited above and look forward to more of this </p><p>      crucial support to keeping Zimbabweans informed. </p><p>      SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
