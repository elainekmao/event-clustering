<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000274 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SECRETARY POWELL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, ETRD, PTER, CVIS, CA, IZ, KN, VE, Bill Graham </p><p>SUBJECT: YOUR JANUARY 30 MEETING WITH CANADIAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER GRAHAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) 02 STATE 234708 (B) 02 STATE 234719 (C) </p><p>     OTTAWA 178 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Your January 30 meeting with Foreign Minister Bill </p><p>Graham will be an important opportunity to bolster Canadian </p><p>support for our Iraq policy.  The Canadian Government\'s </p><p>natural preference is for giving the inspectors more time and </p><p>for the UN Security Council to reach consensus, but it wants </p><p>to stand with the U.S. in the end.  Like in other countries, </p><p>public skepticism is growing here over military action </p><p>against Iraq.  Graham needs to hear the same message that </p><p>President Bush gave the UNGA on September 12, that this is a </p><p>test of the UN\'s ability to impose its will and to respond </p><p>effectively to a crisis.  In addition to Iraq, Graham will </p><p>want to discuss North Korea, Latin America, missile defense, </p><p>softwood lumber trade, and entry/exit controls at border. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) While Canada\'s position on Iraq has not changed since </p><p>your November 14 Ottawa meeting with Graham (refs. A and B), </p><p>divisions among allies on the Security Council and within </p><p>Canada\'s Liberal Party have increased pressure on the </p><p>Chretien Government.  The Canadian position remains that it </p><p>will participate in a UN-blessed operation against Iraq, and </p><p>that it is reserving judgement on participation if there is </p><p>no explicit Security Council approval.  Canadian military </p><p>planners have been in Tampa since early January, consulting </p><p>with CENTCOM planners about a possible Canadian contribution. </p><p> Publicly, Chretien does not want to admit the possibility </p><p>that Canada might participate without UN blessing, and he </p><p>reined in Defense Minister McCallum for doing so after </p><p>McCallum\'s January 9 meeting with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld </p><p>(ref. C). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Claude Laverdure, the Prime Minister\'s Foreign Policy </p><p>Advisor, told the DCM on January 17 that Canada could indeed </p><p>support military action in Iraq absent a second UNSC </p><p>resolution, especially in a case where 11 or 12 Security </p><p>Council members think there has been a material breach but </p><p>China or another country vetoes a resolution.  Laverdure said </p><p>there should be an "international consensus," but not </p><p>necessarily UN action.  Chretien and Graham both told the </p><p>press on January 23 that there is not yet justification for a </p><p>war on Iraq, and that the inspectors need to keep up the </p><p>pressure. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>NORTH KOREA </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Graham has been a vocal critic of North Korea since </p><p>the October announcement on its nuclear weapons program. </p><p>Canada pushed hard for a G-8 statement during its Presidency, </p><p>and called for the International Atomic Energy Agency to </p><p>refer North Korea\'s actions to the UN Security Council. </p><p>Canada established diplomatic relations with North Korea in </p><p>2001, and North Korean diplomats have been searching for an </p><p>Embassy location in Ottawa.  Canada is continuing </p><p>humanitarian assistance to North Korea, but otherwise the </p><p>bilateral relationship is on hold. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>LATIN AMERICA </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Graham will brief you on his January 20-21 trip to </p><p>Brasilia, where he met with Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and </p><p>other newly appointed members of the Brazilian government. </p><p>He will also want to discuss the situations in Venezuela, </p><p>Colombia and Haiti.   Canada supports the mediation efforts </p><p>of OAS Secretary General Gaviria in Venezuela, and has called </p><p>for an end to political violence in all three countries. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MISSILE DEFENSE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Canadian officials from Foreign Affairs and Defense </p><p>will be taking part in missile defense consultations with </p><p>U.S. counterparts on January 28.  Graham and McCallum plan to </p><p>brief Cabinet following these consultations, and come to a </p><p>decision sooner rather than later on Canadaian participation. </p><p> While missile defense remains a controversial issue in </p><p>Canada becaue of arms control concerns, the GoC realizes that </p><p>the train is leaving the station and that other allies are </p><p>getting on board.  Graham may also note that our new </p><p>binational Planning Group is up and running at NORAD, and </p><p>that this will help us coordinate our military response to </p><p>terrorist threats to North America. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>SOFTWOOD LUMBER </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Under U.S. trade law, the Department of Commerce can </p><p>determine that the circumstances leading to a U.S. industry </p><p>request for countervailing duties have materially changed. </p><p>Having made that determination through a "changed </p><p>circumstances" review, Commerce can reduce or eliminate the </p><p>duties in question without further formal action by the </p><p>affected U.S. industry.  Except for British Columbia, </p><p>lumber-producing provinces have been agnostic about current </p><p>efforts to encourage changes in provincial lumber policies </p><p>through this review process.  Commerce has set February 14 as </p><p>the deadline for publication of the draft policy bulletin </p><p>that will be the basis on which provinces may apply for </p><p>changed circumstances reviews.  The draft will reflect input </p><p>from GOC and provincial officials as well as Canadian and </p><p>U.S. industry organizations, and will be open to further </p><p>revision during the 30-day comment period ending in </p><p>mid-March. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The changed circumstances review has been useful in </p><p>encouraging all the provinces to look for market-oriented </p><p>policies that are consistent with their own needs and </p><p>forestry management objectives.  But the review is only a </p><p>small step forward, even if BC manages to take full advantage </p><p>of it.  At some point we will need to get back to the </p><p>negotiating table.  The U.S. Government has made it clear to </p><p>U.S. industry that we are not interested in border measures </p><p>(export taxes or quotas) unless they are temporary and are a </p><p>transition to an already negotiated end point.  You may wish </p><p>to stress this point with Minister Graham if he raises the </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>BIOTECH </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The European Union,s refusal even to accept </p><p>applications for new biotech food products is an outrageous </p><p>breach of WTO rules, sound science, good governance and </p><p>common sense.  There is good reason for the United States to </p><p>take the matter to a WTO dispute panel. If we do, USTR </p><p>Zoellick has a commitment from Canadian Trade Minister Pierre </p><p>Pettigrew for Canada to join the United States as a </p><p>co-complainant.  Graham is generally supportive of Canada,s </p><p>being a co-complainant, but it would be useful to reiterate </p><p>to him our strong interest in partnering with Canada on this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>BORDER </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Graham may raise the National Security Entry/Exit </p><p>Registration System (NSEERS), which you discussed in your </p><p>November meeting.  NSEERS requires fingerprinting and </p><p>registration of certain naturalized Canadian citizens and </p><p>landed immigrants seeking admission at U.S. ports of entry. </p><p>U.S. law still requires that nationals (including dual </p><p>nationals) from an expanding list of "criteria" countries be </p><p>registered, but the earlier public controversy over </p><p>registration based solely on country of birth has dwindled. </p><p>What may now be worrying Graham, as it does Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Manley, is implementation - by 2005 - of a new </p><p>entry-exit tracking system for all visitors to the U.S., </p><p>which may include Canadians.  Ottawa fears that the </p><p>entry-exit system will create huge delays at border </p><p>crossings, and continues to seek some sort of exemption or </p><p>expedited measures for Canadians. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
