(C)  Also in attendance:  Ambassador Edmund Hull, FBI </p><p>Executive Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Pat </p><p>D\'Amuro, in-coming LEGATT Stephen Gaudin, and Mueller\'s </p><p>Counselor Jonathan Solomon.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Overview </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Director Mueller arrived in Aden on June 2 as </p><p>part of a larger regional tour.  The Director met with </p><p>Ambassador Hull upon arrival to discuss agenda items for the </p><p>Director\'s meeting with President Saleh.  Arriving in Yemen </p><p>from Saudi Arabia, the Director was able to provide a </p><p>valuable assessment of the current situation there.  He noted </p><p>SAG\'s renewed activism in the fight against terror and their </p><p>concern about the transfer of weapons and explosives from </p><p>Yemen -- specifically from the weapons souk in Saada.  SAG </p><p>also provided the Director with a list of items confiscated </p><p>during illegal border crossings from Yemen that was </p><p>mentioned, but not delivered, to President Saleh. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Ambassador highlighted intelligence indicating </p><p>that a Saudi based group tried to recruit Abu Assem </p><p>(Al-Makki), number two on the U.S. most wanted list for </p><p>Yemen, to conduct terrorist acts in Saudi, which Abu Assem </p><p>declined.  This is a warning and it should serve as a message </p><p>to the Yemenis that these individuals must be apprehended. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>President Saleh and Director Mueller </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  Starting a cordial meeting with President Ali </p><p>Abdullah Saleh, Director Mueller conveyed President Bush\'s </p><p>thanks for continuing ROYG efforts, particularly the recent </p><p>arrest of IIS agents.  Mueller presented Stephen Gaudin to </p><p>Saleh as the new Legal Attache-designate to Yemen, noting his </p><p>years of experience in CT and his involvement in the East </p><p>Africa Embassy bombings investigation.  Gaudin\'s selection is </p><p>evidence of the FBI\'s long-term commitment.  The FBI will </p><p>send additional personnel to support him, increasing the </p><p>frequency and quality of its exchanges with the Political </p><p>Security Organization (PSO) and the Ministry of Interior </p><p>(MOI).  Mueller also introduced Executive Assistant Director </p><p>for Counterterrorism Pat D\'Amuro.  Based out of Washington, </p><p>D\'Amuro will be traveling throughout the region, including </p><p>Yemen, to met with his counterparts in the months ahead. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  President Saleh welcomed Mueller and stressed his </p><p>wish to enhance cooperation and coordination between the FBI, </p><p>PSO, and MOI.  He also noted the importance of information </p><p>sharing to continue the joint efforts to arrest those </p><p>responsible for terrorism and identify "sleeper" Al-Qaeda </p><p>cells in Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Return of Yemeni Detainees at GTMO </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  President Saleh cited the recent return of Saudi </p><p>detainees from GTMO to SAG.  He said that, when the U.S. </p><p>investigation of Yemenis at GTMO is complete, they should be </p><p>handed over to Yemen so ROYG can conduct their own </p><p>investigation and perhaps uncover more sleeper cells.  Saleh </p><p>noted that, at the end of the day, the USG is not going to </p><p>adopt tough measures against these individuals, but Yemen </p><p>can.  These people must be a burden to the U.S. and ROYG is </p><p>only trying to help. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF)  Mueller affirmed that USG authorities continue to </p><p>look at the individuals at GTMO and will take appropriate </p><p>steps when their investigations are complete.  ROYG has had </p><p>an opportunity to meet with Yemenis at GTMO. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF)  Ambassador Hull added that there is a request for </p><p>additional information from ROYG about some of the people in </p><p>Yemeni custody. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Al-Moayed </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S/NF)  President Saleh noted that the USG wants to </p><p>prosecute Sheikh Mohammed Ali al-Moayed, but ROYG considers </p><p>him a businessman, not a terrorist.  He suggested that the </p><p>U.S. have the CIA and FBI investigate al-Moayed\'s activities, </p><p>and, when the investigation is over, the U.S. should turn </p><p>al-Moayed over to ROYG who will perform their own </p><p>investigation. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S/NF)  Director Mueller assured President Saleh that </p><p>significant evidence of links to terrorist financing has been </p><p>collected against al-Moayed and the case against him is quite </p><p>strong. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Re-education of Former Al-Qaeda </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S/NF)  Saleh outlined an ongoing ROYG initiative to </p><p>re-educate former Al-Qaeda members.  The goal is to get them </p><p>to repent and pledge their loyalty to ROYG and the country. </p><p>This program is being run through moderate religious clerics, </p><p>and Saleh believes it will provide ROYG with valuable </p><p>information that will lead to the apprehension of more </p><p>people. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (S/NF)  Mueller expressed concern that while these </p><p>"reformed" individuals may promise not to commit terrorist </p><p>attacks in Yemen, they may do so somewhere else.  President </p><p>Saleh assured that these individuals are not permitted to </p><p>leave Yemen.  Saleh noted that people with "blood on their </p><p>hands" were not eligible for this program.  He added that </p><p>last Ramadan (Nov/Dec 2002) the ROYG released 36 "reformed" </p><p>individuals who were all doing well, proof that ROYG\'s </p><p>re-education -- a mixture of religion, culture, and education </p><p>-- is working. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (S/NF)  Saleh also said that the fact that nothing </p><p>happened to Americans in Yemen during the war in Iraq was </p><p>important evidence that ROYG\'s intervention, especially </p><p>Saleh\'s personal intervention, was effective. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Precarious Regional Security Situation; Saudi Factor </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (S/NF)  Comparing the lack of central control in Iraq to </p><p>the situation in Yemen after the 1994 civil war, Saleh said </p><p>the bombings in Saudi Arabia were due in part to the flow of </p><p>arms out of Iraq.  Director Mueller countered with the Saudi </p><p>theory that the weapons used in these attacks actually came </p><p>from Yemen.  While noting that it was a possibility, Saleh </p><p>asked why the Saudis fail to control their own borders, </p><p>including the Yemeni one. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (S/NF)  Mueller noted that the question of Saudis </p><p>controlling their borders is a separate issue from the </p><p>ability to buy weapons -- RPGs, explosives, etc. -- from </p><p>Yemen.  Saleh mentioned ROYG\'s weapons-buyback program -- in </p><p>the last few months ROYG says they have bought-back about </p><p>70-80% of the weapons from the souks -- but again cited </p><p>instability in Iraq as an immediate threat.  Saleh said that </p><p>weapons dealers in Yemen have been trying to get permission </p><p>to go to Iraq because the weapons there are cheaper.  Saleh </p><p>also noted that members of the "former Iraqi regime"  were </p><p>now selling weapons and munitions to Al-Qaeda, although he </p><p>gave no sources. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (S/NF)  Saleh later agreed with the Director and the </p><p>Saudis on proliferation from Saada (a northern city with a </p><p>large weapons souk), confirming that ROYG knows the </p><p>explosives used against the Cole and explosives used to </p><p>target Saleh\'s residence were from Saada. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>CT Cooperation and Training </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (S/NF)  Saleh said that while cooperation with CIA is </p><p>good, cooperation with FBI is only fair; the ROYG has needs </p><p>that should be discussed.  Mueller said that is why Steve </p><p>Gaudin has been assigned to Yemen for the next two years as </p><p>the first Legal Attache permanently assignment to Yemen. </p><p>Mueller also noted that the FBI will conduct a two week </p><p>course on crime scene investigation, evidence collection, </p><p>etc. at the end of July for 24 Yemeni officials.  Equipment, </p><p>which the officials will retain, will also be provided. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>Sidebar:  President Saleh and Director Mueller One-on-One </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>19.  (S/NF)  At the conclusion of the delegation\'s meeting </p><p>with the President, Saleh dismissed everyone except Director </p><p>Mueller (and the President\'s interpreter) to have a private </p><p>exchange.  During this sidebar, Saleh informed the Director </p><p>that ROYG has information indicating that disaffected Iraqis </p><p>are contacting elements of al-Qaeda to plot against U.S. </p><p>interests.  No details or sourcing were provided. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>USS Cole Escapees </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C)  During a working lunch hosted by Minister of </p><p>Interior Alimi and PSO Director Gamish, discussion continued </p><p>on numerous issues including the April 11 escape of ten </p><p>prisoners from a high-security prison facility in Aden.  Four </p><p>of the ten were implicated in the October 2000 attack against </p><p>the USS Cole. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (C)  PSO Security Director Gamish noted that they have </p><p>proved difficult to find, but the investigation continues. </p><p>ROYG distributed names and photos of the escapees, there is a </p><p>reward, and ROYG is trying to find their hideouts.  President </p><p>Saleh and Gamish both commented that intel indicates the </p><p>escapees are still in Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Requests for Assistance and New CT Unit </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C)  Both Alimi and Gamish had a list of items their </p><p>respective organizations require to improve their </p><p>effectiveness, including computers, crime scene processing </p><p>kits, and magnetometors.  Alimi also announced the </p><p>establishment of a new CT Unit as called for by a recent Arab </p><p>League ruling.  ROYG has given this unit a site, but the unit </p><p>will require training and equipment before it is fully </p><p>operational. </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C)  Director Mueller suggested that the U.S. has found </p><p>small vetted units to be more effective than large divisions. </p><p> He added that those who receive specialized training must </p><p>use it (i.e. no good to train people and then transfer them </p><p>to a unit where they don\'t use that skill).  Alimi agreed and </p><p>noted that personnel selection is key; however, ROYG needs </p><p>larger units to ensure that qualified individuals are </p><p>available when they are needed.  Gamish explained that </p><p>turnover is high due in part to the importance of family.  If </p><p>a family member is needed at home or elsewhere, they will go. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C)  Ambassador Hull noted the importance of maintaining </p><p>these skills with periodic exercises. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Press Coverage </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>25.  (C)  Press coverage of the Director\'s visit was limited, </p><p>but positive, highlighting increased bilateral cooperation </p><p>and USG appreciation for ROYG\'s efforts to combat terrorism. </p><p>(Note:  Many weekly papers have not yet published.) </p><p> </p><p>26.  (U)  Text of the Embassy\'s official press release: </p><p> </p><p>(Begin text.) </p><p> </p><p>FBI Director Mueller Visits Yemen; Meets President Saleh </p><p> </p><p>Robert Mueller, Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of </p><p>Investigation, met with Yemen\'s President Ali Abdullah Saleh </p><p>in Aden Monday to discuss counter-terrorism and legal </p><p>cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>Director Mueller\'s brief stopover in Aden came as part of his </p><p>tour of the countries in the region to discuss the global </p><p>struggle against terrorism.  Director Mueller briefed </p><p>President Saleh on his talks with Saudi officials regarding </p><p>the latest terrorist attacks in Riyadh that left more than </p><p>thirty people dead.  He also underlined the existing close </p><p>security cooperation between the United States and Yemen, and </p><p>expressed the hope that the relationship would continue and </p><p>develop further.  In this regard, he told President Saleh </p><p>about the establishment of a LEGATT (Legal Attache) office at </p><p>the U.S. mission in Sanaa. </p><p> </p><p>Also, attending the meeting in Aden were Yemeni Interior </p><p>Minister Alimi and PSO Chief General Ghamesh as well as U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Yemen Edmund Hull. </p><p>(End text.) </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
