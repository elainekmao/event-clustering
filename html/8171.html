<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR CA/OCS/CI, CA/OCS/ACS/EAP, CA/OCS/PRI, CA/VO/F/P </p><p>EAP/BCLTV, L/EAP </p><p>Bangkok for INS/DD </p><p>Ho Chi Minh City for CONS and INS OIC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KOCI, CVIS, CASC, PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM: MEETING WITH JUSTICE MINISTRY ON ADOPTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) STATE 72446, B) Savage-Vann telcon May 7, 2002, C) </p><p> </p><p>O-I May 19, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) Summary.  The GVN has indicated that the content of </p><p>the draft MOU provided is generally quite good and close to </p><p>their draft framework.  However, the GVN is backtracking </p><p>from earlier assurances by the former Vice Minister of </p><p>Justice that Vietnam would be willing to go forward with an </p><p>MOU as "the format and title" of the document were "not </p><p>important."  However, the GVN is now raising concerns </p><p>regarding format and title of the document.  Adoption, </p><p>citizenship and children\'s rights are governed in Vietnam at </p><p>the central (federal) level.  The GVN is questioning an </p><p>MOU\'s applicability beyond the ministry-to-ministry level </p><p>(in Vietnam, the title MOU is given to ministry-to-ministry </p><p>level documents) as well as the authority of ministry level </p><p>employees (Embassy staff) to reach agreement and sign a </p><p>document with broader applicability (GVN officials are </p><p>rarely given such authority.)  The GVN is interested in </p><p>reaching a compromise, but would like to see a more formal </p><p>title and format as well as written indications that the </p><p>document will have broader applicability and that Embassy </p><p>staff will have the authority to work towards consensus on </p><p>such a document. Action request para 10.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On May 7, 2003, Consular Chief met with Mr. Nguyen </p><p>Van Binh, Vice Director of the Department for International </p><p>Treaty and International Cooperation, Ministry of Justice </p><p>(MOJ.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Binh stated that the overall content of the draft </p><p>MOU submitted is "good," and quite close to their draft </p><p>framework.  He repeated this several times throughout the </p><p>meeting. He added the disclaimer that he had not had time to </p><p>review the document word-for-word, but he commented that </p><p>there would be a lot of time to discuss on words and terms </p><p>used in the MOU. </p><p> </p><p>Questions of Applicability and Authority </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Binh said that the problems perceived at this early </p><p>stage are with the title and the format of the MOU.  The </p><p>term "MOU" is used in Vietnam only for documents signed at </p><p>the ministry-to-ministry level.  Because of its larger legal </p><p>implications, an adoption "agreement" must be signed at the </p><p>government-to-government level, even if the negotiating and </p><p>signing authority is delegated to the ministry level.  He </p><p>stated that recently, President Luong invited the Minister </p><p>of Justice and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to a meeting </p><p>to discuss international treaties and asked the two </p><p>Ministries to standardize the titles of documents signed </p><p>with foreign countries and ratified by the GVN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The GVN makes a clear distinction between the State </p><p>and the Government.  Binh explained that the GVN enters into </p><p>international "treaties" at three levels: International </p><p>treaties involving multiple governments are signed at the </p><p>State-to-State level (i.e., by the President); bilateral </p><p>treaties signed at Government-to-Government level (i.e., by </p><p>the Prime Minister); and treaties signed at ministry-to- </p><p>ministry level.  The GVN wants adoption "agreements" to be </p><p>signed at the `bilateral\' (Government-to-Government) level </p><p>because adoption involves two legal fields (the rights of </p><p>children and nationality law) which are the responsibility </p><p>of the Prime Minister, not the Ministries.  (Note:  Given </p><p>the tendency of GVN Ministries to ignore MOUs and </p><p>commitments made by other Ministries, we are encouraged by </p><p>MOJ\'s desire to arrive at an agreement that would ensure </p><p>compliance by all the relevant GVN players.  This has been a </p><p>point of contention regarding the Agreed Consular Minute, </p><p>which was signed by the State Department and the Foreign </p><p>Ministry.  The Ministry of Public Security\'s position is </p><p>that it is not bound by the Minute, and this results in </p><p>consular notification delays, impediments to prison visits, </p><p>etc.  Despite the greater effort the we will have to make on </p><p>our part to satisfy the GVN\'s concerns, in the end we should </p><p>have a document that is enforceable in Vietnam, which is the </p><p>whole point.)  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Regarding negotiations, Binh said that the </p><p>Vietnamese delegation taking part in formal discussions is </p><p>an interagency delegation which includes representatives of </p><p>Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry </p><p>of Public Security, Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social </p><p>Affairs, the Office of the Government, and the Committee for </p><p>Population and Family Planning.  The discussions can be </p><p>carried out in several rounds.  Initially, specialists or </p><p>experts can begin talks (round one) without a specific </p><p>"delegation of authority" from the Prime Minister.  For </p><p>subsequent discussions (round two-three), a delegation of </p><p>authority from the Prime Minister to the negotiating team is </p><p>required in order to finalize the agreements and sign the </p><p>documents.  The Minister of Justice will similarly be </p><p>delegated the authority to sign in the name of the </p><p>President.  France was not able to reach agreement in the </p><p>first round - three rounds were ultimately needed. However, </p><p>Italy and Denmark (who negotiated more recently), reached </p><p>agreement in the first round and the formal delegation of </p><p>authority was not required.  (Comment:  Although Binh did </p><p>not mention it, obtaining such a "delegation of authority" </p><p>can be time consuming.  Even if not, it appears to raise the </p><p>discussion to a more formal level that the U.S. would prefer </p><p>to avoid.  It is in our best interests to prepare to </p><p>complete discussions in the first round.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Following the meeting, MOJ sent a dipnote </p><p>reiterating the GVN\'s motivation for seeking a bi-lateral </p><p>agreement and requesting a formal written explanation of the </p><p>US position why such an agreement is not possible.  While it </p><p>may seem that the GVN is repeating previously covered </p><p>material, we see this as a positive sign that the GVN is </p><p>ready to move forward (although the direction of that </p><p>progress is unknown).  In Vietnam, no decision is made or </p><p>recommendation made based on discussions alone.  Until the </p><p>issue or response is put into writing, it cannot be </p><p>presented to higher authorities for decision. (We also note </p><p>that they do not use the term MOU or agreement in their </p><p>first paragraph.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Text of MOJ dipnote follows. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Justice of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam </p><p>presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States </p><p>of America in Hanoi and has the honor to mention preparation </p><p>for the negotiations on adoption cooperation between the two </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Justice welcomes efforts made by the U.S. </p><p>Embassy in advancing relations between the two countries </p><p>regarding international adoptions.  At the meeting between </p><p>the Deputy Chief of Mission with ministerial level </p><p>representative of MOJ and the Chief of the Consular Section </p><p>with department level representative of MOJ, the Vietnam </p><p>side provided information on Vietnamese law and practice </p><p>regarding adoption.  Currently, Vietnam is conducting </p><p>negotiations with an aim to signing bilateral adoption </p><p>agreements with foreign countries in order to provide the </p><p>best protection of the rights of children adopted by </p><p>foreigners.  Under Vietnamese law, an international treaty </p><p>regarding adoptions is of the kind that Vietnam signs in the </p><p>name of the State - the highest level of international </p><p>treaty with Vietnam.  At the same time, according to </p><p>agreement with other countries and Vietnamese convention, </p><p>the name of this kind of international treaty is an </p><p>"Agreement". </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Justice highly values the content of "The </p><p>Memorandum of Understanding Between the United States of </p><p>America and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Regarding </p><p>Adoptions" prepared by the U.S. side.  The content of the </p><p>MOU is not much different from Vietnam\'s Framework that has </p><p>been used as a foundation to negotiate with other countries. </p><p>However, through the meetings, MOJ also understand the U.S. </p><p>side\'s difficulties in selecting a name for the document </p><p>regarding adoptions between the two countries.  Therefore, </p><p>the use of another name for the document (not MOU) this is </p><p>in conformity with the desire of the two sides currently is </p><p>still an open problem. </p><p> </p><p>In order to have a foundation to report to the competent </p><p>state agencies of Vietnam to consider and reach a decision </p><p>on the issue of adoption negotiations between the two </p><p>countries, the MOJ has the honor to request the Embassy to </p><p>officially explain the U.S. legal stipulations relating to </p><p>the U.S. authority for signing and formalities of U.S. </p><p>international treaties; and at the same time, to confirm the </p><p>difficulties on the U.S. side in selecting a name for the </p><p>document regarding adoption between the two countries. </p><p> </p><p>The MOJ appreciates the Embassy\'s efforts on this issue and </p><p>hopes to receive the Embassy\'s response soon. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Justice of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam </p><p>avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of </p><p>the United State of American the assurances of its highest </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>Which Draft and Legal References </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Since the US draft and the GVN framework are so </p><p>close in content, Binh stated that the question remains open </p><p>as to which document to use as a basis for negotiation and </p><p>stated that either is fine.  (Post will indicate to Binh </p><p>that we prefer to work from our draft.)  Noting our </p><p>reference to relevant US laws and the GVN circular and </p><p>decree, he requested copies of the referenced US laws and </p><p>indicated that there may be additional legal references on </p><p>the GVN side (copies of any referenced laws will be </p><p>provided). </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Response </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Consular Chief reminded Binh of Vice Minister </p><p>Cuong\'s earlier commitment to work towards an MOU instead of </p><p>an agreement.  (Comment:  Former VM Cuong was a close and </p><p>cooperative Embassy contact. However, Cuong is no longer at </p><p>the Ministry of Justice and Binh may not feel compelled to </p><p>fulfill commitments made by Cuong.  End Comment.)  Consular </p><p>Chief reiterated US policy that no bilateral agreement is </p><p>signed where a multilateral convention is available and </p><p>reminded Binh of the time-consuming procedures required for </p><p>obtaining Congressional ratification of a bilateral </p><p>agreement.  She explained that for the USG, bi-lateral </p><p>treaties make law, from which policies are made; while an </p><p>MOU is an equally significant document which goes straight </p><p>to the policy making end-result.  She also repeated the USG </p><p>interest in moving forward quickly and corrected Binh\'s </p><p>statement (para 3) that there is plenty of time for </p><p>discussions. </p><p> </p><p>Action Request </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) The GVN request for written confirmation of </p><p>negotiating authority is a common one as they rarely empower </p><p>anyone below a Deputy Prime Minister level to make </p><p>commitments on behalf of the GVN.  In order to satisfy the </p><p>GVN that the State Department has been delegated this </p><p>authority by law or regulation and to address the concerns </p><p>outlined in paras 5 and 6, please provide written </p><p>confirmation/documentation that by U.S. law the State </p><p>Department is assigned the role as central authority on </p><p>international adoptions and the Ambassador/Embassy\'s </p><p>authority to negotiate and sign on behalf of the USG.  A </p><p>second option would be to confirm that as the representative </p><p>of the President, the Ambassador already has the authority </p><p>to "negotiate" and sign an agreement at higher levels than </p><p>ministry-to-ministry, and to document his delegation of that </p><p>authority to our "team".  Also, please provide a copy of: </p><p>"United States Public Law 106-295, October 30, 2000 - The </p><p>Child Citizenship Act of 2000" as per para 8. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
