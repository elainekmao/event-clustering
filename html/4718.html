<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 07 TEGUCIGALPA 003365 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA, WHA/PPC, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>STATE FOR PM, INL, EB, AND CA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: OVIP, MARR, MASS, MOPS, PREL, PGOV, SNAR, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR GENERAL HILL\'S VISIT TO HONDURAS </p><p>DECEMBER 18-19 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires, a.i., Roger Pierce; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Honduran President Ricardo Maduro, in </p><p>office since January, faces numerous challenges in one of the </p><p>poorest and most corrupt countries in the Western Hemisphere. </p><p> His Administration has been stalled on its domestic agenda </p><p>since June as it tries to reconcile its ambitious goals to </p><p>its straitjacketed financial situation.  Bilateral relations </p><p>between the U.S. and Honduras are excellent; Honduras was the </p><p>first country in Central America (and the second in Latin </p><p>America) to sign an ICC Article 98 Agreement with the U.S. </p><p>and its support for the international counterterrorism effort </p><p>is steadfast.  The United States and Honduras have maintained </p><p>a long-standing close relationship framed by such events as </p><p>the establishment of the banana plantations in the late </p><p>1800s, the Contra wars of the 1980s, and reconstruction </p><p>efforts in the wake of the October 1998 fury of Hurricane </p><p>Mitch.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Key Issues in Bilateral Relationship </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The central themes in our bilateral diplomatic </p><p>efforts in Honduras are combating international crime by </p><p>strengthening governance and attacking corruption, assisting </p><p>American citizens, fostering economic development, promoting </p><p>regional stability, promoting trade and investment, and </p><p>combating terrorism.  However, the underlying difficulty to </p><p>realizing USG objectives is improving the administration of </p><p>justice and rule of law.  President Ricardo Maduro\'s </p><p>government is fully engaged on all of these issues, supports </p><p>judicial and political reform, and is seeking to transform </p><p>Honduras so that law and order can be restored and economic </p><p>growth ignited.  He faces formidable challenges from </p><p>entrenched economic and political interests in moving his </p><p>agenda forward. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Status of the Maduro Government </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) President Maduro is facing increasing criticism </p><p>from the political opposition over his government\'s policies </p><p>and continued dissatisfaction from his own party\'s Members of </p><p>Congress because of his Administration\'s technocratic style. </p><p>The Honduran Congress is a focal point of political </p><p>opposition to his policies.  It is a corrupt institution </p><p>riddled with avaricious politicians, and Maduro\'s National </p><p>Party does not control a majority of the unicameral body. </p><p>The ongoing problems within his own party are serious and </p><p>threaten his broader political agenda, which will require </p><p>legislation to advance.  Continuing political negotiations </p><p>will be needed to manage this situation.  Maduro\'s personal </p><p>life also intruded into the political sphere.  His October </p><p>wedding to a Spaniard was criticized by many Hondurans who </p><p>viewed the President as distracted by his personal life. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The President\'s standing has remained stalled at a </p><p>low point since June.  Faced with slow progress in his </p><p>efforts to promote regional economic integration, Maduro\'s </p><p>team is pinning its hopes that a U.S.-Central American Free </p><p>Trade Agreement (CAFTA) can serve as a catalyst to regional </p><p>economic cooperation.  Maduro is also beginning to hear wider </p><p>disillusionment among the Honduran public as violent crime </p><p>levels are increasing once again despite his successful </p><p>initial "zero tolerance" law and order campaign. </p><p>Notwithstanding his crackdown on street crime, actual ongoing </p><p>criminal investigations, in particular homicides, remain </p><p>stalled. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Counterterrorism Cooperation </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Maduro is a good and reliable friend of the U.S. on </p><p>counterterrorism.  His government hosted a major U.S. </p><p>military counterterrorism exercise in March and has quickly </p><p>responded with freeze orders to all U.S. requests regarding </p><p>suspect terrorist bank accounts.  No terrorist assets have </p><p>been found in Honduran financial institutions, to date.  The </p><p>GOH still needs to take the following concrete steps: </p><p>designate a national coordinator for counterterrorism, file </p><p>its national report in accordance with United Nations </p><p>Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1373, and most of all, </p><p>sign and/or ratify the five outstanding international </p><p>conventions/protocols and two OAS conventions (1971 and 2002) </p><p>against terrorism.  It is also of vital importance for </p><p>Honduras to improve security at its maritime ports, </p><p>particularly Puerto Cortes. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) While the GOH is in general supportive of key USG </p><p>foreign policy goals, the Ministry of Foreign Relations </p><p>appears hesitant to be out front supporting the USG position </p><p>on Iraq.  Securing a UNSC Resolution on Iraq has helped </p><p>mollify MFA officials concerns about the need for </p><p>multilateral support via the United Nations.  Lacking Rio </p><p>Group consensus the GOH is not yet willing to make a public </p><p>statement backing U.S. policy on Iraq.  However the U.S. </p><p>should be able to count on Honduras\' support when a final </p><p>decision is taken. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Anticorruption </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The new U.S. policy against corruption struck a </p><p>nerve in Honduras, especially any mention of our new visa </p><p>revocation authorities.  Politicians in Congress and certain </p><p>business elements feel the U.S. is attacking them.  Maduro is </p><p>committed to addressing corruption, even if it will cost him </p><p>political support within his party.  The Supreme Court </p><p>President is also on board.  Given the scope of the problem, </p><p>any public discussion about the country\'s pervasive </p><p>corruption is a positive development. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Supreme Court and Judicial Reform </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The Supreme Court is developing into an independent </p><p>branch of power, unlike all of its predecessor courts since </p><p>democracy was restored in 1982.  It is pro-reform in </p><p>orientation and fighting for its prerogatives.  In some </p><p>respects, the development of the court in Honduras\' restored </p><p>democracy is approaching its "Marbury v. Madison" moment. </p><p>The emerging issue is whether it can become a fully </p><p>independent and co-equal branch of political power, </p><p>consistent with the separation of powers provision in the </p><p>Honduran Constitution.  The established political order is </p><p>fighting that prospect with all its might.  In fact, the </p><p>Congress recently seized the political opportunity to </p><p>introduce legislation that would give itself the power to </p><p>interpret the constitutionality of the laws its passes. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Public Security/Human Rights </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Upon taking office on January 27 President Maduro\'s </p><p>first act was to fulfill his main campaign promise -- a zero </p><p>tolerance campaign against the country\'s out-of-control crime </p><p>situation.  He deployed more than 5,000 soldiers to the </p><p>streets to support the police.  The public responded </p><p>enthusiastically.  However, despite the initial success of </p><p>establishing a visible police presence, violent crime, </p><p>particularly homicides and kidnappings, has only fallen </p><p>marginally.  Public support is fading and the campaign needs </p><p>some visible victories to restore confidence in the </p><p>government\'s program.  We are helping the Maduro government </p><p>establish an anti-kidnapping unit, increase intake/training </p><p>of police recruits, create a model tourist police force, </p><p>boost its counternarcotics efforts, and expand the frontier </p><p>police.  The country\'s geographic position makes it an </p><p>obvious strategic transit point for narcotics trafficking, </p><p>alien smuggling operations and other organized crime </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Extrajudicial killings, especially of </p><p>children/young adults between 1998-2001, have been a source </p><p>of serious concern and only recently has the GOH begun to </p><p>take steps to investigate the hundreds of unsolved cases. </p><p>There has been some discussion of the establishment of a </p><p>Truth Commission to look into unresolved alleged human rights </p><p>abuses from the 1980s.  There are serious problems with child </p><p>labor in several industries, particularly melon, coffee, and </p><p>shrimp (but not the maquila) sectors, and trafficking in </p><p>persons of women/children for prostitution in the U.S. and </p><p>children for commercial sexual exploitation in Central </p><p>America.  USAID and Peace Corps have both been involved in </p><p>HIV/AIDS prevention. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Some 500,000 Hondurans, both legal and illegal, </p><p>live in the U.S., a fact that places immigration issues high </p><p>on the bilateral agenda.  (The population of Honduras is 6.5 </p><p>million.)  There is deep appreciation for the </p><p>Administration\'s extension of Temporary Protected Status </p><p>(TPS) in the U.S. and interest in possible congressional </p><p>action on the pending Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central </p><p>American Relief Act (NACARA), which would give immigration </p><p>parity for Hondurans.  With fourteen thousand American </p><p>citizens residing in Honduras and many thousands visiting </p><p>Honduras annually for tourism and business American Citizen </p><p>Services are a key part of the Embassy\'s work.  Until </p><p>recently, there was little progress in most of the now more </p><p>than 30 American citizen murder cases; however, there have </p><p>been three convictions in these cases in recent weeks.  In </p><p>the last year the GOH has increased cooperation with the </p><p>Embassy on these cases, including establishing two </p><p>prosecutors.  However, little progress has been made on </p><p>extradition cases involving American Citizens wanted for </p><p>felonies in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Border Relations </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Honduras has border disputes with its three </p><p>Central American land neighbors and its seven maritime </p><p>neighbors.  Maduro is personally engaged with his </p><p>Presidential counterparts to address these issues.  Its land </p><p>and maritime disputes with El Salvador and Nicaragua are the </p><p>most heated.  The Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific coast is a </p><p>particularly difficult point.  A 1992 International Court of </p><p>Justice (ICJ) ruling laid out shared areas of control in the </p><p>Gulf of Fonseca and established the land border between </p><p>Honduras and El Salvador, although El Salvador has been slow </p><p>to implement the ruling.  In September of this year El </p><p>Salvador requested a revision of the 1992 ICJ ruling. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) On the Caribbean coast, Honduras and Nicaragua </p><p>have a long-standing maritime border dispute over the 15th </p><p>parallel.   Honduras provoked Nicaraguan retaliation when it </p><p>signed a maritime treaty with Colombia recognizing the 15th </p><p>parallel as its maritime border in 1999.  Nicaragua filed an </p><p>ICJ case over the maritime border and more importantly in </p><p>1999 slapped a punitive 35 per cent tariff on Honduran goods </p><p>that remains in place despite a Central American Court of </p><p>Justice ruling that it is illegal.  With former Nicaraguan </p><p>President Arnoldo Aleman deposed as President of the National </p><p>Assembly, GOH officials have expressed renewed optimism that </p><p>Nicaraguan President Enrique Bolanos will make good on </p><p>private assurances to lift the tariff and thereby take an </p><p>important step forward toward regional economic integration, </p><p>especially given the fact that the ICJ recently ruled in </p><p>favor of the GOH\'s petition against the tariff.  You may wish </p><p>to compliment Maduro on the GOH,s restraint and note that </p><p>the regional integration benefits of a CAFTA with the U.S. </p><p>(as well as other integration efforts) will be undermined by </p><p>a trade war. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Troubled Economy Endangers IMF Program and HIPC Debt Relief </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) President Maduro inherited a stagnating economy </p><p>and seriously deteriorated government finances from the </p><p>previous government.  The GOH missed all key International </p><p>Monetary Fund (IMF) targets in 2001.  Even after the Maduro </p><p>economic team won passage of austerity and tax measures in </p><p>May of this year, the government\'s budget deficit is still </p><p>expected to be a high 5.9 percent of GDP.  It is important </p><p>for the GOH to undertake the meaningful and long overdue </p><p>reforms needed to work out a new IMF program. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) During its November visit the IMF team did not reach </p><p>agreement with the GOH on draft terms of a three-year Poverty </p><p>Reduction and Growth Facility Program (PRGF).  In </p><p>consultations with the IMF mission, the GOH developed a plan </p><p>to improve the fiscal situation in the next few months.  If </p><p>all goes well, the team will return to Honduras in March or </p><p>April to begin negotiations on a program.  The delay of a </p><p>program jeopardizes $240 million in debt relief, concessional </p><p>loans and grants from some donors.  The IMF maintains that </p><p>the situation is unsustainable, unless donors want to </p><p>continue to fund public sector salaries, and watch investment </p><p>in poverty reduction programs continue to dwindle.  The </p><p>Maduro administration has asked the U.S. to push the IMF for </p><p>flexibility, but the Embassy favors supporting the IMF on its </p><p>push for real fiscal and economic reform in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) International Financial Institution (IFI) and </p><p>bilateral donor disbursements will be held up until the new </p><p>IMF program is in place.  There could also be pressure on GOH </p><p>Paris Club debt service payments (USD 100 million per year). </p><p>In the meantime, the completion point for Highly Indebted </p><p>Poor Countries (HIPC) debt reduction (worth USD 900 million) </p><p>continues to slip back further.  Ultimately, this fiscal </p><p>situation could impact Honduras\' eligibility for Millennium </p><p>Challenge Account grants. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) The Honduran economy is growing slowly (estimated </p><p>real GDP growth of 1.8 percent this year).  Low world coffee </p><p>prices continue to hurt the economy in rural areas. </p><p>Inflation continues to decrease slowly, estimated at 8-9 </p><p>percent in 2002.  The currency is depreciating at a rate of </p><p>about five percent per year.  The economy is dominated by </p><p>agriculture - particularly the production of coffee, bananas </p><p>and cultivated shrimp - although the in-bond apparel assembly </p><p>industry has grown dramatically over the past decade and </p><p>remittances, from Hondurans living overseas, continues to </p><p>grow rapidly (up 38 percent in the first six months of this </p><p>year) and have become the most important source of foreign </p><p>exchange.  The U.S. is Honduras\' largest trading partner; </p><p>roughly 150 U.S. companies do business here.  While many </p><p>social indicators are improving, two-thirds of all Hondurans </p><p>live in poverty and average educational levels are very low. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) Maduro has personally identified himself with a </p><p>CAFTA as his government\'s principal trade objective.  The </p><p>Minister of Industry and Trade is reorganizing the Ministry </p><p>(historically fairly weak) and adding staff in a belated </p><p>effort to get ready for the negotiations.  The Maduro </p><p>administration has also been more cooperative with the U.S. </p><p>in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva.  Honduras </p><p>(along with other Central American countries) has been </p><p>supportive in the FTAA ministerials but to date has not taken </p><p>an active role in the negotiating groups. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU) Latent protectionism exists in the private sector, </p><p>especially agriculture, but the general attitude toward a </p><p>free trade agreement in Honduras is guardedly positive.  The </p><p>textile and apparel industry in particular believes an FTA is </p><p>the only way that the Honduran apparel sector can survive the </p><p>elimination of quotas in 2005 and compete with Asian </p><p>manufacturers.  As such, it is the strongest supporter of </p><p>CAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>U.S. Investment Faces Problems </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU) The Maduro government understands that Honduras </p><p>needs foreign (and domestic) investment to spur economic </p><p>growth but has placed emphasis on the more immediate problems </p><p>of political and judicial reforms, the fiscal deficit, and </p><p>needed improvements in security, education and health. </p><p>Maduro will tout a new law on simplification of </p><p>administrative procedures and formation of a national </p><p>competitiveness council, headed by Vice President Vicente </p><p>Williams, to enhance the investment climate at all levels of </p><p>society.  The government has identified tourism, </p><p>agribusiness, and forestry as important sectors that could </p><p>create much-needed jobs. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (SBU) Much more needs to be done to declare Honduras </p><p>"open for business."  Maduro needs to find a way to get his </p><p>cabinet (and the prickly legislative and judicial branches) </p><p>to make meaningful changes that will resolve the key </p><p>problems: poor and expensive infrastructure; weak legal </p><p>system; personal security, education and health conditions; </p><p>land tenure problems; and opposition to large foreign </p><p>investments by well-connected vested interests. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (SBU) The Honduran government has stalled in its past </p><p>efforts to liberalize and privatize the electricity and </p><p>telecommunications markets.  On November 15, the National </p><p>Electric Energy Company (ENEE) announced that Honduran </p><p>company Lufussa was winner of the 210 mega-watts electricity </p><p>tender, ignoring Lufussa\'s failure to comply with bid </p><p>requirements and serious allegations of impropriety.  This </p><p>was a heavy blow for U.S. company AES, which seeks to build a </p><p>$600 million combined cycle plant in Puerto Cortes.  On </p><p>November 26, AES challenged the award to ENEE\'s decision, </p><p>citing a failure to disqualify Lufussa for the omissions in </p><p>its bid (e.g., insufficient transmission facilities and </p><p>failure to specify the type of fuel to be used) and other </p><p>irregularities.  The Honduran Attorney General and the Office </p><p>of the Inspector General have announced that they are </p><p>investigating the matter.  The GOH telecom regulatory agency </p><p>is also bidding out a second cellular phone license this </p><p>year; one U.S. company has been pre-qualified.  The GOH has </p><p>requested USG policy support for liberalization of the </p><p>telecom (through the Trade and Development Agency) and power </p><p>(through USAID) sectors.  However, in order to make these </p><p>long overdue structural reforms a reality, the Maduro </p><p>government must follow through on its commitments. </p><p> </p><p>23.  (SBU) Land tenure problems (combined with a weak </p><p>judicial system) are endemic in Honduras, and undermine </p><p>efforts to develop the tourism, agriculture and forestry </p><p>sectors.  They also deter new investments in a variety of </p><p>other sectors.  The Embassy has files on 112 property dispute </p><p>cases (generally squatter/land reform cases and title </p><p>disputes), of which 32 are active.  There are an additional </p><p>68 commercial disputes, of which 14 are currently active. </p><p>The GOH is adopting a law allowing some of the land cases to </p><p>be submitted to arbitration and is working on an improved </p><p>property registry system.  In recent weeks, we have seen </p><p>notable progress in handling by the judicial system of </p><p>commercial and investment disputes involving U.S. citizens. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Money Laundering and Bank Failures </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  (SBU) Strengthened money laundering legislation, with an </p><p>antiterrorist financing clause, was the first law to be </p><p>adopted by the new Congress in late February of this year. </p><p>The GOH has followed up rapidly with creation of a Financial </p><p>Information Unit.  Currently, 70 potential cases are under </p><p>investigation.  Weakness of the financial system remains a </p><p>key concern.  The GOH took over the two most troubled banks </p><p>in May 2002, arranged for the absorption of a third </p><p>undercapitalized bank and is actively promoting mergers among </p><p>the remaining 20 private banks. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Bilateral Political/Military Issues </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25.  (C) In January of 1999, the constitution was amended to </p><p>abolish the position of military commander in chief of the </p><p>Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF), thus codifying civilian </p><p>authority over the military.  Honduras now has a civilian </p><p>Minister of Defense (MOD) and a Chief of the Joint Staff who </p><p>heads the HOAF.  Civilian control is well accepted by the </p><p>HOAF, and the transition to civilian control has resulted in </p><p>greater transparency and fiscal accountability.  The current </p><p>MOD, Fred Breve, enjoys a good relationship with the HOAF </p><p>military leadership, but the Office of the Minister of </p><p>Defense still lacks a staff that could provide institutional </p><p>memory and continuity between the change in political </p><p>administrations. </p><p>26.  (U) There are a number of bilateral political/military </p><p>issues with which Post routinely deals - brief summaries of </p><p>recent issues follow. </p><p> </p><p>Cerro La Mole Radar </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>27.  (C) In 1993, the U.S. entered into an agreement with the </p><p>GOH regarding the maintenance of the radar located at Cerro </p><p>La Mole, under which it agreed to pay 75 percent of </p><p>maintenance costs up to $400,000 per year.  The U.S. has paid </p><p>nothing under the agreement, and the issue affects relations </p><p>between the U.S. and Honduran militaries.  Post has sought </p><p>guidance from DOD and State on how to resolve our </p><p>obligations, and recommended that the U.S. either replace the </p><p>radar with a solid state version (TPS-78) or with another </p><p>TPS-70 transferred from counterdrug programs.  Alternatively, </p><p>the U.S. could repair the radar to operational status.  When </p><p>operational, the radar provides a view of the </p><p>Honduras-Nicaragua-El Salvador border areas and the Gulf of </p><p>Fonseca on the Pacific Ocean.  If operational, the radar </p><p>could be helpful in the fight against narcotrafficking. </p><p> </p><p>Naco </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>28.  (C) The small town of Naco hosts the 4th Logistical Base </p><p>(CALE) and a large cache of weapons and artillery.  In 1985, </p><p>Longlac Enterprises, a Panamanian-registered arms importer, </p><p>sent weapons to Honduras on deposit for use by the HOAF. </p><p>After years of poor storage and neglect, the cache became a </p><p>serious hazard, and in 1993 an explosion killed two people. </p><p>In 2001 the GOH destroyed the unstable weapons, and moved the </p><p>remaining weapons to a more secure storage facility -- </p><p>supposedly eliminating the threat to the nearby population. </p><p> </p><p>29.  (C) Meanwhile, Longlac sold the cache of arms to </p><p>Miami-based Samco Global Arms.  For several years, there has </p><p>been a complicated legal battle over the ownership of the </p><p>weapons and who is responsible for removing them.  Currently, </p><p>the Honduran courts control the storage facility and the </p><p>inventories.  The legal battles become even more complicated </p><p>when Samco sued the GOH in Miami and the GOH counter-claimed. </p><p> Post is concerned that the weapons might fall into the hands </p><p>of arms traffickers or terrorists, and we have advised the </p><p>GOH of the USG willingness to assist in the destruction or </p><p>disposal of the remaining cache once ownership is established. </p><p> </p><p>30.  (C) On July 31, the prosecutor from the Task Force </p><p>against Organized Crime conducted a spot check, accompanied </p><p>by a Court Clerk from the Fourth Circuit of the Honduran </p><p>Criminal Court, a DAO military attache, and a team of arms </p><p>experts from the Defense Intelligence Agency.  The prosecutor </p><p>conducted the spot check using an inventory attested to by </p><p>affidavit of the Chief Judge of the Fourth Criminal Court of </p><p>San Pedro Sula and the Commander of the CALE dated July 31, </p><p>2001.  Among other arms and ammunition, the inventory </p><p>included 790 AKMS assault rifles that are Chinese-made AKMS </p><p>type 56-1 -- copies of the Soviet folding stock AKMS.  The </p><p>recent spot check revealed that 230 of the AKMS are missing, </p><p>presumably stolen.  On August 28, the high command of the </p><p>HOAF designated an Army Auditor to investigate the alleged </p><p>theft of the arms. </p><p> </p><p>Joint Task Force Bravo (JTF-B) Account Freeze </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>31.  (C) This spring, an automobile accident occurred </p><p>involving a USG vehicle from JTF-Bravo, causing injuries to </p><p>four Hondurans, as well as vehicle damage.  A civil lawsuit </p><p>was filed against two JTF-B personnel, and ultimately, a </p><p>court issued an order freezing the local JTF-B bank account. </p><p> </p><p>32.  (C) The 1954 Bilateral Military Assistance Agreement </p><p>(BMAA) expressly provides that the USG funds are not subject </p><p>to this sort of legal process.  Eventually, the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs (MFA) persuaded the Supreme Court to order </p><p>that the account be freed from the inappropriate legal </p><p>actions of the lower court. </p><p> </p><p>Bay Islands Vetting </p><p>------------------- </p><p>33.  (C) In 2002, U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships began port </p><p>calls/liberty visits in the Bay Islands after a period of </p><p>many years without any ship visits.  We suspect that a number </p><p>of businesses in the Bay Islands are owned, in whole or in </p><p>part, by individuals who are suspected of being involved in </p><p>narcotrafficking and other illegal activities, or who are </p><p>convicted felons.  Post formed a committee to gather </p><p>information about Roatan hotels and their owners in order to </p><p>formulate a policy regarding the patronization of such </p><p>businesses -- particularly in instances where U.S. government </p><p>monies are used. </p><p> </p><p>Recent Military Promotions </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>34.  (C) On December 6, 18 HOAF officers (two generals, 15 </p><p>colonels and one lieutenant colonel) who are members of the </p><p>twelfth promotion group unexpectedly retired.  These </p><p>honorable retirements came in the wake of a scandal involving </p><p>General Mario Raul Hung Pacheco (also of the twelfth </p><p>promotion group), who allegedly stole money from the Honduran </p><p>Military Retirement Fund.  Some of the retiring officers </p><p>emphasized that they served their country honorably, and that </p><p>the HOAF should not be judged solely by those officers who </p><p>were involved in corruption.  Another promotion ceremony took </p><p>place on December 11 -- amongst the ranks of those officers </p><p>were General Jose Isaias Barahona (the current Chief of the </p><p>Joint Staff), Jorge Andino, Luis Maldonado and Rodolfo </p><p>Interiano.  Interiano\'s promotion was unexpected because of </p><p>his previous problems with the Maduro Administration.  He is </p><p>expected to stay in Washington, DC as the Honduran Defense </p><p>Attache. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>A Great Tragedy </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>35.  (U) At approximately 8:55 p.m. on December 11, a U.S. </p><p>Army Black Hawk helicopter from Joint Task Force Bravo </p><p>crashed while engaged in a night training exercise -- killing </p><p>five (5) U.S. soldiers who belonged to the 1st Battalion, </p><p>228th Aviation Regiment.  The helicopter flew from Soto Cano </p><p>Air Base to La Mesa international airport in San Pedro Sula </p><p>to participate in a night landing exercise.  After refueling </p><p>the helicopter headed back to Soto Cano, and 40 minutes later </p><p>crashed into the mountains near Santa Cruz de Yojoa, which is </p><p>85 miles north of Tegucigalpa. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Embassy Tegucigalpa </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>36.  (SBU) Embassy Tegucigalpa is a medium-sized post, </p><p>employing 140 U.S. citizens and 300 Hondurans among 20 USG </p><p>agencies.  Our Peace Corps program, with more than 220 </p><p>volunteers, is one of the world\'s largest, and the USAID </p><p>mission had a FY02 budget of USD 34.5 million.  The Mission </p><p>maintains a Consular Agent in Honduras\' second city and </p><p>industrial center, San Pedro Sula.  Five-hundred and fifty </p><p>U.S. service men and women are stationed at Honduras\' Soto </p><p>Cano Air Base under the auspices of SOUTHCOM as Joint Task </p><p>Force Bravo.  In 1954, the USG and GOH signed a Bilateral </p><p>Military Assistance Agreement that set forth their intention </p><p>to work closely together to foster peace and security in the </p><p>Western Hemisphere.  The ICC Article 98 Agreement with </p><p>Honduras is therefore a particularly important </p><p>accomplishment, and will enable our military forces to </p><p>continue to work together in such areas as disaster recovery, </p><p>joint training exercises, and counternarcotics missions. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
