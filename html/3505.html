<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001838 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KMDR, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT MUGABE ON TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Mugabe vows to slap sanctions on EU, </p><p>      U. S.," the August 13 edition of the independent daily "The </p><p>      Daily News" carried the following article as its lead </p><p>      story.  In the piece, President Mugabe promises to strike </p><p>      back against the punitive travel restrictions imposed </p><p>      against himself and members of his administration by the </p><p>      United States, European Union and other Western countries: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "President Mugabe yesterday (August 12) announced his </p><p>      government would take measures against U. S. and E. U. </p><p>      interests in Zimbabwe, in retaliation against their own </p><p>      restrictions on him and his close allies.  Stung by U. S. </p><p>      and E. U. travel bans and smart sanctions, Mugabe said in </p><p>      an unusually emotional speech: `Britain, Europe and America </p><p>      can impose sanctions or do worse devilish things.  Let </p><p>      Europe, in the name of their monstrous `god,\' banish all </p><p>      the disabled, banish all wives, banish all children, all </p><p>      brothers and sisters and all cousins of our men and women </p><p>      of conscience.\' </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Mugabe said his government would in due course </p><p>      implement its own phased but comprehensive measures </p><p>      against countries that had imposed sanctions on his </p><p>      government. . .\'  We refuse to be hapless victims. </p><p>      That is never the response of revolutionaries.  Just </p><p>      as they regard their right to impose sanctions on us, </p><p>      they should recognize that we reserve the right to </p><p>      respond as best we know how.  They appear to have </p><p>      forgotten that they also have interests here,\' Mugabe </p><p>      said. . .\'  Let Europe\'s list grow by another 50, and </p><p>      100, another thousand, another million. . .grow by </p><p>      all but the puppets and stooges they sponsor here, </p><p>      who gladden them by dancing to their tune.  But we </p><p>      shall not budge, we shall not be deterred on this one </p><p>      vital issue.  Shame to them. . . .!"\' </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
