<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001281 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PHUM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIONAL ELECTIONS CONVOKED FOR NOVEMBER 9 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) officially announced </p><p>on May 15 the convocation of elections for President, all 158 </p><p>seats in Guatemala\'s unicameral Congress and mayors and city </p><p>council members to take place on November 9, 2003.  If no </p><p>candidate for President receives more than 50% of the vote, a </p><p>second round of elections (only for President) will be held </p><p>on December 28.  The convocation by the TSE officially begins </p><p>the electoral campaign, though "unofficial" campaigning has </p><p>been going on for several months.  Parties can now officially </p><p>register their candidates, and it is expected that the major </p><p>parties will name their candidates within the next few weeks. </p><p> The ruling Frente Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG) is </p><p>scheduled to hold its national assembly on May 24, at which </p><p>it will nominate its candidate.  The GANA coalition is </p><p>backing the presidential candidacy of Oscar Berger, but is </p><p>still considering its slate for legislators and local </p><p>government positions.  The left-of-center UNE (which garnered </p><p>20% of the vote in the 1999 elections) will again register </p><p>Alvaro Colom as its candidate, and the small Democracia </p><p>Cristiana (DC) is supporting Ricardo Bueso for President. </p><p>The Partido de Avanzada Nacional (PAN) recently split and has </p><p>not yet identified a presidential candidate. </p><p> </p><p>2.  A legal controversy over the make-up of the TSE remains </p><p>unresolved.  When the current members of the TSE were </p><p>sworn-in in 2002, one of the permanent members did not accept </p><p>the position.  He was replaced by an alternate, but Congress </p><p>failed to elect a new permanent member as some contend the </p><p>law demands.  On May 14 the Constitutional Court instructed </p><p>Congress to elect a permanent member by May 15.  A vote was </p><p>held in Congress on possible replacements, but none of the </p><p>candidates received the required two thirds majority. </p><p>Representatives of three of the major political parties told </p><p>reporters that they do not believe this impasse should have </p><p>any bearing on the legitimacy of the elections, but </p><p>constitutional lawyers argue that the current composition of </p><p>the TSE exposes the entire electoral process to future </p><p>litigation and possibly annulment by the Constitutional </p><p>Court.  Congress will hold a special session in July to try </p><p>once again to replace the missing permanent member of the TSE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Comment: The opening of the electoral race will distract </p><p>the government, the political parties and many elements of </p><p>civil society from other urgent tasks of governing and </p><p>legislating during the next few months.  Polls have not been </p><p>published since the recent break-up of the PAN, and it is not </p><p>clear which potential candidates have the best chance of </p><p>making it into the second round.  The biggest unknown remains </p><p>the question of whether Rios Montt will be named the </p><p>candidate of the FRG, and how the courts would deal with his </p><p>candidacy.  There is a growing move among some of the </p><p>opposition parties to unite in order to better confront the </p><p>FRG.  Should former General Rios Montt decide to run, it is </p><p>expected that the momentum to unite the opposition will grow. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
