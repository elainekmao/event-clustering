THE OBJECTIVE IS TO CONTROL ARAB OIL AND </p><p>SERVE ISRAEL\'S INTERESTS. IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON CANNOT FIND A SINGLE ARAB OR NON-ARAB VOICE </p><p>THAT STANDS WITH IT IN ITS AGGRESSION.

THE ISSUE IS NOT ECONOMIC </p><p>EVEN IN THE LAST DEGREE.  IT IS A NATIONAL CAUSE THAT </p><p>BECOMES NECESSARY IN VIEW OF THE ARAB OFFICIAL MEDIA\'S </p><p>CONCERN ONLY WITH ISSUES THAT DO NOT CONCERN ARAB </p><p>CITIZENS.
