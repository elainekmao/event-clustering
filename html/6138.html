<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001421 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 5 COB </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1406 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Market - Rally Continuing </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) All Turkish markets continued to strengthen in </p><p>afternoon trading on March 5, with expectations of the </p><p>rallies continuing into March 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira appreciated over 2 percent, to close at TL </p><p>1,609,000.  According to several market participants (Yapi </p><p>Kredi Treasurer Imece, JP Morgan/Chase Treasurer Gumisdis), </p><p>Turks switching their lira back into dollars was the main </p><p>cause of the lira movement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The benchmark lira-denominated T-bill (March 3, 2004 </p><p>maturity) strengthened 4.5 percentage points to 58 percent </p><p>compounded, with trades at tomorrow settlement lower still at </p><p>56.5 percent compounded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index closed up 2 percent </p><p>on the day, in moderate trading volume of TL 486 trillion </p><p>(about $300 million). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Both Turkish banks and London-based investment </p><p>banks tell us their investors are relying on a second </p><p>parliamentary resolution, which they see as unlocking a very </p><p>generous U.S. package.  These investors see confirmation of </p><p>this scenario in the AK Chairman Erdogan and TGS Chief of </p><p>Staff Ozkok statements (reftel).  There is an additional </p><p>element motivating Turkish investors, per the bankers who </p><p>serve them:  Turks are already invested, want to be </p><p>optimistic to protect their own investments, and are likely </p><p>to stay in.  Some foreign hedge funds are likely to sell on </p><p>the good news of the U.S. package\'s approval, should that </p><p>happen. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
