<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, AF/W, AF/RA AND AF/E </p><p>DEPT ALSO PASS TO JEFF MILLINGTON, OFFICE OF SUDAN SPECIAL </p><p>ENVOY </p><p>LONDON, PARIS, ROME, OSLO FOR AFRICA WATCHERS </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZER AND MILLER </p><p>DIA FOR J.GERHARD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, MASS, MOPS, CG, SU, BY, ZI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED ON NIGERIAN FOREIGN POLICY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This message was delayed in transmission, but contains </p><p>information that may be of value to end-users. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Jeter and NSA Mohammed February 6 </p><p>discussed the Ikeja cantonment tragedy and Nigeria\'s request </p><p>for large-scale EOD assistance.  Mohammed also briefed the </p><p>Ambassador on measures taken in northern Nigeria to forestall </p><p>reprisals in the wake of the Yoruba-Hausa ethnic clashes in </p><p>Lagos.  The two also discussed various regional conflicts. On </p><p>Sudan, Ambassador Jeter informed the NSA about Senator </p><p>Danforth\'s efforts to obtain the agreement of Bashir and </p><p>Garang to our proposed four confidence building measures; for </p><p>his part, Mohammed said that Nigeria was content with its </p><p>current behind-the-scenes role of nudging the parties toward </p><p>dialogue, whatever the forum.  On DROC, Mohammed thought the </p><p>key to progress was to get Kabila, Bemba, and Onusumba to </p><p>talk, implying he did not think the Inter-Congolese Dialogue </p><p>would yield much fruit without these three reaching an </p><p>understanding.  Mohammed stated Nigeria was deeply concerned </p><p>about Zimbabwe and that an avenue for a graceful Mugabe exit </p><p>was needed.  Closer to home, Sierra Leone was on the mend </p><p>with the official declaration of the war\'s end.  Meanwhile, </p><p>Charles Taylor, because of his own internal problems, was </p><p>being less of a problem elsewhere in the region.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>IKEJA AND LAGOS </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) After discussing the Ikeja explosion and President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s special appeal for assistance, Nigerian National </p><p>Security Advisor, retired LTG Aliyu Mohammed expressed his </p><p>concern about the ammunition depot in his hometown, Gusau </p><p>(Zamfara State).  He said the depot had been there for years, </p><p>and the town grew around the site as the population expanded. </p><p> Now, instead of being on the outskirts, the depot was </p><p>practically in the middle of the state capital.  He voiced </p><p>interest in an EOD support team assessing all munitions </p><p>facilities in Nigeria.  (COMMENT:  Such assessment visits are </p><p>now incorporated into the overall support concept of our EOD </p><p>assistance to Nigeria.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) When Ambassador Jeter expressed concern that the </p><p>Yoruba-Hausa conflict in Lagos could spark reprisal attacks </p><p>in the North, Mohammed retorted that the GON had enlisted the </p><p>support of Northern governors and traditional leaders to do </p><p>their statesmen-like best to make certain that there were no </p><p>violent repercussions in the North, as had happened in the </p><p>past.  Additionally, the police were being visibly deployed </p><p>in strategic locations to deter incitement of violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>POLICE TRAINING </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) NSA Mohammed was grateful when the Ambassador informed </p><p>him the Embassy would begin a police-training program </p><p>including curricula development, a centralized criminal </p><p>database and the placement of a U.S. advisor in Police </p><p>Headquarters.  He volunteered to inform the President </p><p>immediately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) SUDAN: After stressing that our policy was not to </p><p>create another peace initiative in competition with IGAD or </p><p>the Egyptian initiative, Ambassador Jeter told Mohammed about </p><p>Special Envoy Danforth\'s January trip to the area and the </p><p>progress made, particularly on the Nuba mountains cease-fire. </p><p> Mohammed thought that maintenance and expansion of the </p><p>ceasefire was critical.   After its plans to host an </p><p>all-Sudanese conference were aborted late last year, Nigeria </p><p>had been content with limiting its efforts to encouraging all </p><p>parties to communicate.  Mohammed informed us that Tripoli </p><p>was trying to become more active in promoting the Egypt-Libya </p><p>Initiative (ELI).  Tripoli had called a March /April meeting </p><p>on Sudan and had invited Nigeria to be an observer. The NSA </p><p>extended an invitation to Senator Danforth to visit  Abuja on </p><p>any future trips to Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DROC: Mohammed said Nigeria continued to encourage </p><p>Osunumba and Bemba to meet Kabila.  However, they continued </p><p>to balk at any venue where Kabila was accorded the status of </p><p>Head of State.  They felt this gave Kabila an undeserved aura </p><p>of legitimacy when, in fact, he was handed power only because </p><p>of his father\'s demise. Since Kabila was not democratically </p><p>elected and because he controlled less than half the national </p><p>territory, Kabila should be treated as one of three equal </p><p>faction leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ZIMBABWE: Mohammed expressed strong concern about </p><p>Zimbabwe.  He revealed that Obasanjo had hosted MDC President </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai for two days in Abuja prior to the </p><p>President\'s late January trip to Harare.  When President </p><p>Obasanjo met with Mugabe, according to the NSA, Obasanjo </p><p>recommended that Mugabe consider retirement.  However, Mugabe </p><p>responded that he was committed to run, having passed the </p><p>point of no return with regard to keeping his word to his </p><p>followers.  Mugabe said that he could only consider retiring </p><p>after winning the election.  Mohammed opined that Mugabe was </p><p>old and that part of him wanted to leave politics, but the </p><p>other part feared his vulnerability to prosecution by his </p><p>opponents should he leave the Presidency.  Moreover, Mugabe </p><p>and his henchmen were profiting from trade in Congolese </p><p>diamonds due to his close relationship with Kabila.  This </p><p>lucrative interest would likely die once Mugabe left high </p><p>office.  While eventually Mugabe must go, Mohammed wondered </p><p>how the MDC could govern if it came to power in the short </p><p>term.  "All of the government structures in Zimbabwe," </p><p>including the police and security services, were "100 percent </p><p>ZANU-PF," implying that any MDC government could be paralyzed </p><p>by a disloyal civil service and security apparatus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) LIBERIA:  "We don\'t trust Taylor," Mohammed said.   If </p><p>the Liberian President had his druthers, he would try to sate </p><p>his large appetite for power at the expense of his neighbors. </p><p> However, Taylor has to think small now due to the pressures </p><p>on him.  Worried about the LURD and afraid of being labeled a </p><p>terrorist supporter in the aftermath of September 11, Taylor </p><p>was trying to convince the world that he was reforming, to </p><p>preempt further international pressure and isolation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Mohammed also had no compliments for Burkina Faso\'s </p><p>Blaise Campaore.  While Campaore had invited some of Taylor\'s </p><p>political opposition to set up shop in Burkina, the NSA did </p><p>not believe Campaore had broken from Taylor.  Nigeria </p><p>continued to support holding an ECOWAS-sponsored Liberian </p><p>reconciliation meeting in Abuja as soon as this could be </p><p>arranged. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
