<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003647 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, IT, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY FULLY SUPPORTS DRAFT OPTIONAL PROTOCOL ON </p><p>TORTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 130158 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POL P. THIEDE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.    (C) IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL DEMARCHE, MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR </p><p>FOR HUMAN RIGHTS EMANUELE PIGNATELLI TOLD POLOFF JULY 23 THAT </p><p>THE GOI SHARES THE EU POSITION ON THE DRAFT OPTIONAL PROTOCOL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03647  240902Z </p><p>ON TORTURE.  STATING THAT THE GOI HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET THE </p><p>USG TO SIGN THE DOPT, PIGNATELLI OUTLINED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>POSITION WITH CONVICTION.  THE GOI IS "PROFOUNDLY CONVINCED" </p><p>OF THE DOPT\'S NECESSITY.  NEGOTIATING THE DOPT TOOK TEN </p><p>YEARS; ALL SOLUTIONS AND NATIONAL POSITIONS WERE CONSIDERED. </p><p>AN INTERNATIONAL BODY ABLE TO INTERVENE TO PREVENT CASES OF </p><p>TORTURE AND TO HELP COUNTRIES DEVELOP LEGAL FRAMEWORKS TO </p><p>PREVENT TORTURE IS ESSENTIAL.  THE SUCCESS OF THE EUROPEAN </p><p>CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE AND ITS COMMITTEE TASKED WITH THE </p><p>TYPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES ENVISIONED BY THE DOPT HAD CONVINCED </p><p>THE GOI OF THE VALUE OF EXPANDING THEM TO THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) PIGNATELLI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE DOPT "COULD ALWAYS </p><p>BE IMPROVED."  HOWEVER, THE DRAFTING COMMITTEE HAD DONE AN </p><p>EXCELLENT JOB, AND IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE A SLIGHTLY-IMPERFECT </p><p>DOPT THAN NONE AT ALL.  WITH REGARD TO THE PROCEDURAL </p><p>CONCERNS RAISED BY REFTEL AND PREVIOUS DEMARCHES, PIGNATELLI </p><p>SAID THAT CONSENSUS IS CERTAINLY PREFERABLE BUT NOT ALWAYS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  IN THIS CASE, BEING ABLE TO BRING THE DOPT TO A </p><p>VOTE ENABLED THE CHR TO RESOLVE A DILEMMA; I.E., HOW TO PASS </p><p>THE DOPT WITHOUT WATERING IT DOWN SO MUCH AS TO BE USELESS. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) CURRENTLY, THE GOI IS ENGAGED IN AN EFFORT TO </p><p>CONVINCE OTHER COUNTRIES WITH GOOD HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS TO </p><p>ACCEDE TO THE DOPT, NOTING THAT ITS AIM IS TO PREVENT </p><p>TORTURE, NOT TO JUDGE OR CONDEMN OTHER GOVERNMENTS. </p><p>NONETHELESS, THE GOI "FULLY APPRECIATED THE CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>THAT THE USG HAS EXPRESSED." </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03647  240902Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03647 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
