<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000858 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/ARN, NEA/ARP, INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, EAID, JO, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) OIL FOR JORDAN:  GOK AWAITS SPECIFIC REQUEST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah told the </p><p>Ambassador March 10 that Kuwait still awaits a specific </p><p>request for support from Jordan (whose FM Muasher was due </p><p>here later in the day).  He spoke ambiguously about whether </p><p>Kuwait\'s $100 million deposit in the Jordanian Central Bank </p><p>is just a deposit or an unofficial grant.  On Iraq, Shaykh </p><p>Sabah said "do it quickly"; he repeatedly requested that his </p><p>government receive formal notification "at least one or two </p><p>days" in advance of hostilities.  He urged the USG to be </p><p>sensitive to Saudi Arabia\'s need for discretion in its </p><p>cooperation with us.  Shaykh Sabah regretted that the UAE had </p><p>not done more to push its proposal that Saddam leave office. </p><p>He also regretted disunity on the UN Security Council, but </p><p>blamed France, which he said would be "crazy" to veto the </p><p>latest draft resolution.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Ambassador, accompanied by Pol Chief (Notetaker), </p><p>met with First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister </p><p>Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jabir al-Sabah March 10.  MFA </p><p>Undersecretary Amb. Khaled al-Jarallah sat in along with Amb. </p><p>Khaled al-Babtain, Director of the Americas Department, and </p><p>Amb. Ahmed al-Fahd, Director of the Minister\'s Office. </p><p> </p><p>(C) OIL FOR JORDAN </p><p>------------------ </p><p>3.  (C)  The Ambassador said he had an instruction to urge </p><p>GOK support for Jordan in the event the supply of oil from </p><p>Iraq is cut off.  Shaykh Sabah said Kuwait has taken no </p><p>decision on providing oil, awaiting a specific request from </p><p>King Abdullah to the Amir.  (Jordan\'s FM Marwan Muasher was </p><p>due to arrive in Kuwait later in the day, and the Kuwaitis </p><p>seemed to expect him to bring a message from the King.) </p><p>Meanwhile, Shaykh Sabah noted, the GOK has deposited $100 </p><p>million in Jordan\'s Central Bank.  He laughed that the GOJ </p><p>had asked if it could use that money, and Kuwait replied: </p><p>"it\'s yours; why did we put it in your name?"  The Ambassador </p><p>sought to clarify whether this meant the money -- which we </p><p>had always understood was just a deposit, a form of </p><p>balance-of-payments support --  was in effect a grant. </p><p>Shaykh Sabah responded ambiguously:  "We told them, if you </p><p>can\'t use it, why did you take it?"  (COMMENT:  This may be a </p><p>signal that the $100 million is a de facto, off-budget grant, </p><p>but we do not consider that clearly established.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>(C) IRAQ:  "DO IT QUICKLY" </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>4.  (C) There was considerable discussion about Iraq.  The </p><p>Ambassador reiterated the USG\'s deep appreciation for all of </p><p>Kuwait\'s support, noting that he had publicly described it as </p><p>"1000 percent of our wildest dreams."  Several times during </p><p>the conversation, Shaykh Sabah underscored his desire that we </p><p>act quickly to eliminate Saddam\'s regime:  dragging out the </p><p>process only allows opposition and complications to snowball, </p><p>he emphasized.  Similarly, he urged that we move as fast as </p><p>possible to hand the governing of Iraq back to Iraqis.  He </p><p>specifically -- and repeatedly -- requested that the USG give </p><p>the GOK "at least one or two days\' official notice" in </p><p>advance of hostilities. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) He also went out of his way to urge the USG to be </p><p>sensitive to Saudi Arabia\'s need for discretion in its </p><p>cooperation with us, noting that Kuwait "will never forget" </p><p>the Saudi role in liberating it from the Iraqi invasion.  He </p><p>was gratified that there are now some 5,000 Saudi troops in </p><p>Kuwait, along with about 4,000 from the UAE.  He was pleased </p><p>with the UAE\'s initiative in proposing that Saddam step down </p><p>to avert war, but regretted that the UAE had not been more </p><p>active in pushing the proposal, leaving Kuwait to do most of </p><p>the diplomatic work. </p><p> </p><p>(C) AFTER THE WAR </p><p>----------------- </p><p>6.  (C) The Minister asserted that Kuwait feels a duty to </p><p>help the Iraqi people and is giving facilities to the UN </p><p>"upon request."  He said Kuwait is "ready" with sufficient </p><p>stocks to meet the UN\'s requests for humanitarian supplies, </p><p>which he cited from memory as 20,000 MT wheat, 20,000 MT </p><p>flour, and 1 million loaves of bread/day.  The Ambassador </p><p>praised Kuwait\'s role in establishing the Humanitarian </p><p>Operations Center (HOC), whose formal inauguration he had </p><p>just attended.  He also mentioned the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), and </p><p>promised to introduce its head, LTG (Ret.) Jay Garner, to GOK </p><p>officials when he comes to Kuwait next week.  Shaykh Sabah </p><p>was confident that Iraq, "the richest country in the Arab </p><p>world, and I\'m not just talking about oil," could fund its </p><p>own reconstruction/development in the medium to long term. </p><p>He said he would contact his old friend Adnan Pachachi to </p><p>urge him to act for the greater good of Iraq.  In the </p><p>Shaykh\'s view, what the Iraqi people need most is to feel </p><p>free; he argued against forcing our notions of democracy on </p><p>them too quickly. </p><p> </p><p>(C) DEPLORING UNSC DISUNITY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>7.  (C) Shaykh Sabah lamented the disunity of the UN Security </p><p>Council, noting that Kuwait always wants international </p><p>organizations to be united:  otherwise "the big fish are </p><p>eating the small fish."  When the Ambassador assured him that </p><p>we are trying to strengthen the UN, but that we will proceed </p><p>with or without a new UNSCR, the Shaykh remarked that it is </p><p>far too late for us to back down now in any case.  He said he </p><p>had liked UK FM Jack Straw\'s reply to his French counterpart. </p><p> France, he added, would be "crazy" if it vetoed the latest </p><p>draft UNSCR. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Ambassador remarked that the "coalition of the </p><p>willing" is larger than many people realize:  it includes not </p><p>only the UK and Australia, but the Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, </p><p>Romanians, Ukrainians, and perhaps the Bulgarians and </p><p>Albanians, not to mention the countries of the region that </p><p>are allowing use of facilities.  Shaykh Sabah remarked that </p><p>the GOK had given permission to the Ukrainians.  (This has </p><p>not yet filtered down to the working level, however, since </p><p>Ukrainian Ambassador reports he still does not have </p><p>confirmation of Kuwaiti acceptance of the Ukrainian draft </p><p>SOFA.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Shaykh Sabah\'s bottom line was pretty </p><p>clear:  move quickly, get rid of Saddam and his regime, then </p><p>give Iraq back to the Iraqis as soon as possible, without </p><p>trying to mold it in our image.  On support for Jordan, the </p><p>key appears to be a specific GOJ request at the highest level. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
