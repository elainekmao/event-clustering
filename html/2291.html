(C) IN MEETINGS DECEMBER 10-11 WITH SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS </p><p>MUDENGE, AND FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI -- AF ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY KANSTEINER EXPLAINED ZDERA AND ITS IMPLICATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HE EMPHASIZED THAT THERE IS STILL TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE TO AVOID RESTRICTIONS TARGETED AT THE RULING </p><p>ELITE BY REDUCING VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AND ENSURING </p><p>THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IS FREE AND FAIR.  KANSTEINER SAID </p><p>THE USG WOULD USE THE ELECTORAL NORMS AND STANDARDS </p><p>ENDORSED IN MARCH BY THE SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM AS OUR </p><p>BENCHMARKS IN ASSESSING THE FAIRNESS OF THE ELECTORAL </p><p>PROCESS.  MNANGAGWA CLAIMED THAT THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT </p><p>HAD IMPROVED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE PREVIOUS THREE MONTHS, </p><p>AND BLAMED MOST INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE ON THE MDC AND ITS </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  HE PROMISED TO "STUDY" OUR CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE ELECTORAL ACT, AND LATER CALLED </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR TO SAY HE AND THE PRESIDENT HAD DECIDED TO </p><p>EXPUNGE ONE PARTICULARLY TROUBLING PROVISION.  MUDENGE WAS </p><p>COMBATIVE, DISMISSING KANSTEINER\'S REFERENCES TO PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI\'S RECENT EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>INSISTING THAT THE SADC-PF ELECTORAL NORMS AND STANDARDS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03690  01 OF 06  121706Z </p><p>DOCUMENT WAS AN "INTERNAL COMMITMENT AMONG FRIENDS" THAT </p><p>SHOULD NOT RECEIVE SCRUTINY FROM OUTSIDE THE REGION.  THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER PRESSED FOR A LARGE U.S. ROLE IN THE DRC, </p><p>AND SAID ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS WOULD WITHDRAW WHEN ASKED TO DO </p><p>SO BY KINSHASA, "LUSAKA OR NO LUSAKA."  MAKONI PAINTED A </p><p>DISMAL PICTURE OF ZIMBABWE\'S SHORT-TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS, </p><p>AND ENGAGED CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH US ABOUT HOW THE GOZ MIGHT </p><p>FORESTALL IMPOSITION OF TARGETED RESTRICTIONS ON ITS </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ZDERA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE PASSAGE OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA) SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE A/S KANSTEINER\'S </p><p>ARRIVAL ENSURED THAT ZDERA WOULD FIGURE PROMINENTLY IN HIS </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY TOLD ALL THREE GOZ </p><p>MINISTERS THAT ZDERA REFLECTS SERIOUS CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>CONCERNS -- SHARED BY THE ADMINISTRATION -- ABOUT THE </p><p>DIRECTION OF EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE.  ONCE THE SENATE AND HOUSE </p><p>RECONCILE THE MINOR DIFFERENCES IN THEIR VERSIONS, THE </p><p>SINGLE TEXT WILL BE SENT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR SIGNATURE </p><p>INTO LAW.  KANSTEINER EMPHASIZED THAT ZDERA IS NOT A </p><p>SANCTIONS BILL.  RATHER, IT INCLUDES CARROTS AND STICKS </p><p>WHICH CAN BE USED TO INFLUENCE THE GOZ IN A POSITIVE </p><p>DIRECTION, AND INSTRUCTS THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSULT WITH </p><p>KEY INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS -- THE EU, THE COMMONWEALTH, AND </p><p>SADC -- ABOUT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION.  IF THE GOZ DOES NOT </p><p>MEET CERTAIN BENCHMARKS -- ENSURING A RETURN TO THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AN END TO GOVERNMENT- </p><p>SANCTIONED VIOLENCE, AND A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION -- THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03690  01 OF 06  121706Z </p><p>USG HAS THE OPTION OF IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON MEMBERS OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S RULING ELITE, INCLUDING TRAVEL BANS AND FREEZING </p><p>OF ASSETS.   THERE IS STILL TIME FOR THE GOZ TO REVERSE </p><p>COURSE AND AVOID SUCH PUNITIVE ACTION, KANSTEINER ASSERTED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA EXPRESSED </p><p>SURPRISE THAT THE U.S. CONGRESS WOULD PASS SUCH A BILL, AS </p><p>ZIMBABWE ASPIRES TO BE A "SHINING DEMOCRACY." THE KEY </p><p>ACTORS WHO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE ELECTIONS ARE FREE AND </p><p>FAIR, ACCORDING TO MNANGAGWA, ARE ZIMBABWEANS THEMSELVES. </p><p>IN A TENSE EXCHANGE, FM MUDENGE SAID THE BILL WAS "NOT </p><p>HELPFUL," AND DISDAINFULLY REFERRED TO THE SECTION ON </p><p>TARGETED PERSONAL SANCTIONS AS "JESSE HELMS-INSPIRED." </p><p>KANSTEINER POINTED OUT THAT THE BILL HAD PASSED </p><p>OVERWHELMINGLY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND THAT </p><p>NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS HAD </p><p>VOTED AGAINST IT.  MUDENGE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD WHERE THE </p><p>BILL WAS COMING FROM BUT URGED THE USG TO CONVEY ITS </p><p>CONCERNS PRIVATELY TO THE GOZ, NOT DO SO WITH GRAND </p><p>GESTURES OR THROUGH THE MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN A CONSTRUCTIVE AND OPEN CONVERSATION, FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER MAKONI ASKED WHAT ZIMBABWE NEEDED TO DO TO AVOID </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7918 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03690  02 OF 06  121707Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------4A89D7  121707Z /68 </p><p>O 121555Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0517 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 06 HARARE 003690 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 12/12/11 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03690  02 OF 06  121707Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  A/S KANSTEINER DELIVERS TOUGH MESSAGE TO </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TARGETED RESTRICTIONS.  THE GOZ </p><p>SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THE ELECTION </p><p>PROCESS IS TRANSPARENT AND ABOVE BOARD, AND REDUCE VIOLENCE </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION, KANSTEINER SAID.  THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THE GOZ\'S OWN ACTIONS WILL DETERMINE </p><p>WHETHER THE RESTRICTIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.  "YOU HAVE </p><p>YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER," HE SAID, "AND YOU CAN </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER TO PULL IT." </p><p> </p><p>VIOLENCE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) KANSTEINER SAID THE USG FULLY SHARED PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI\'S STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT ONGOING VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION WHICH, ALTHOUGH NOT ONE-SIDED, WAS </p><p>PREDOMINANTLY TARGETED AGAINST OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS. </p><p>MNANGAGWA BLAMED THE VIOLENCE ON THE MDC AND ITS </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  ZANU-PF, HE SAID, IS THE DOMINANT PARTY WHICH </p><p>HAS NO INTEREST IN SEEKING CONFRONTATION WITH "SMALL </p><p>PEOPLE."  IT IS THE NEWCOMERS TO THE POLITICAL SCENE, THOSE </p><p>STRIVING FOR POWER, WHO INITIATE SUCH PROBLEMS.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>SAID HE THOUGHT THE POLITICAL SITUATION HAD IMPROVED DURING </p><p>THE PAST THREE MONTHS.  NO MORE LAND INVASIONS HAVE </p><p>OCCURRED, HE CLAIMED, AND THERE IS NOW LESS VIOLENCE ON </p><p>FARMS.  THE AMBASSADOR RECALLED AN EARLIER CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH MNANGAGWA IN WHICH THE SPEAKER HAD INDICATED HIS </p><p>INTEREST IN SECURING THE AGREEMENT OF THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03690  02 OF 06  121707Z </p><p>TO AN ELECTORAL CODE OF CONDUCT.  SUCH AN AGREEMENT WOULD </p><p>SEND A VERY POSITIVE SIGNAL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, </p><p>KANSTEINER ADDED.  MNANGAGWA REPORTED THAT ONGOING TALKS </p><p>BETWEEN ZANU-PF AND THE MDC ARE FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE, BUT </p><p>HE DID NOT ELABORATE ON WHETHER MUCH PROGRESS HAD BEEN </p><p>ACHIEVED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) KANSTEINER REGISTERED HIS CONCERN WITH MNANGAGWA </p><p>ABOUT THE CASE OF FLETCHER DULINI-NCUBE, THE MDC\'S NATIONAL </p><p>TREASURER.  DULINI-NCUBE HAS BEEN IN DETENTION SINCE MID- </p><p>NOVEMBER, CHARGED WITH INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDER OF LATE </p><p>WAR VETERAN LEADER CAIN NKALA.  THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>SAID HE UNDERSTOOD CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE ONGOING, BUT </p><p>HE URGED THAT DULINI-NCUBE BE GRANTED BAIL IN THE INTERIM, </p><p>AS HIS HEALTH IS APPARENTLY FAILING.  MNANGAGWA SAID IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT THAT THE LAW TAKE ITS COURSE AND THAT THE MDC </p><p>OFFICIAL WOULD EVENTUALLY BE RELEASED IF ACQUITTED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) FM MUDENGE STRONGLY OBJECTED TO KANSTEINER\'S </p><p>REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT MBEKI.  HE SAID HE HAD TOLD BRITISH </p><p>FM JACK STRAW THE DAY BEFORE WHEN HE HAD MADE A SIMILAR </p><p>COMMENT THAT STRAW DID NOT SPEAK FOR THABO MBEKI.  "WHEN I </p><p>WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE SOUTH AFRICANS THINK, I WILL ASK </p><p>THEM.  TODAY, I WANT TO HEAR U.S. VIEWS."  HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>THE GOZ HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO REDUCE VIOLENCE, </p><p>BUT LAMENTED THAT THE TASK IS DIFFICULT SINCE LAND IS AN </p><p>"EMOTIVE ISSUE."  SO ARE POLITICS AND ELECTIONS, KANSTEINER </p><p>COUNTERED.  YES, MUDENGE AGREED, BUT HE NOTED THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>HAD LOST TO THE MDC IN THE DECEMBER 8-9 MAYORAL ELECTION IN </p><p>CHEGUTU (SEPTEL) AND WOULD LOSE THE HARARE MAYORAL </p><p>ELECTION, DUE TO TAKE PLACE BY FEBRUARY 11.  GIVEN THE FACT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03690  02 OF 06  121707Z </p><p>THAT THE MDC HAS WON ALL THREE MAYORAL ELECTIONS HELD THIS </p><p>YEAR, MUDENGE SAID THE MDC\'S COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE </p><p>UNFAIRNESS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS ARE MERELY TACTICAL. </p><p> </p><p>YOU WANT RULE OF LAW, WE\'LL GIVE YOU RULE OF LAW </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) A/S KANSTEINER EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT PENDING </p><p>LEGISLATION DRAFTED BY THE GOZ.  PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE </p><p>ELECTORAL ACT ARE VERY RESTRICTIVE -- THE MOST WORRISOME </p><p>PROVISIONS WOULD CRIMINALIZE POLITICAL POSTERS, LIMIT VOTER </p><p>EDUCATION, AND REQUIRE THAT ELECTION MONITORS BE DRAWN FROM </p><p>THE RANKS OF CIVIL SERVANTS.  THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND </p><p>PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BILL WAS ALSO TROUBLING, AS IT WOULD </p><p>PLACE STRINGENT CONSTRAINTS ON THE MEDIA, REQUIRING, FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, THE LICENSING OF JOURNALISTS BY THE MINISTER OF </p><p>INFORMATION AND FORBIDDING ARTICLES OR POLITICAL CARTOONS </p><p>THAT DENIGRATE OR "INCITE DISAFFECTION FOR" THE PRESIDENT </p><p>OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) WHEN MNANGAGWA PROFESSED IGNORANCE OF THE PROVISION </p><p>ON POLITICAL POSTERS, THE AMBASSADOR SHOWED HIM A COPY OF </p><p>THE TEXT.  MNANGAGWA SAID THE INTENTION OF THAT PROVISION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7928 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03690  03 OF 06  121708Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------4A8A19  121708Z /68 </p><p>O 121555Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0518 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 06 HARARE 003690 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 12/12/11 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03690  03 OF 06  121708Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  A/S KANSTEINER DELIVERS TOUGH MESSAGE TO </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>WAS TO PROHIBIT THE DEFACING OF PROPERTY AND CREATION OF </p><p>SITUATIONS THAT MIGHT ENDANGER ORDINARY CITIZENS -- SUCH AS </p><p>COVERING TRAFFIC SIGNS WITH POLITICAL GRAFFITI.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>THOUGHT THAT MONITORS WOULD BE DRAWN FROM THE PUBLIC AT </p><p>LARGE, NOT JUST CIVIL SERVANTS.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR AGAIN </p><p>POINTED OUT THE RELEVANT PROVISION IN THE PROPOSED </p><p>LEGISLATION, MNANGAGWA SAID HE HAD BEEN UNAWARE OF THAT </p><p>CHANGE AND UNDERTOOK TO STUDY IT.  REGARDING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS, MNANGAGWA SAID DELEGATIONS FROM THE OAU, THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH, THE EU, AND THE SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM HAD </p><p>OBSERVED PREVIOUS ELECTIONS, BUT HE WAS NOT SURE WHETHER </p><p>THE EU WOULD BE INVITED THIS TIME.  MNANGAGWA SAID HE </p><p>SUPPORTED THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT THAT NGOS INTENDING TO </p><p>CONDUCT VOTER EDUCATION REGISTER WITH THE ESC, WHICH WOULD </p><p>ALSO APPROVE ANY MATERIALS THEY PLANNED TO USE.  GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO TAKE THIS STEP, MNANGAGWA </p><p>INSISTED, AS NGOS IN THE PAST WERE GIVEN FREE REIN TO </p><p>CONDUCT VOTER EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS, AND SOME USED THIS </p><p>FREEDOM TO LOBBY FOR PARTICULAR POLITICAL PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) (NOTE: ASKED AT THE END OF THEIR CONVERSATION HOW </p><p>MANY OF THE SPEAKER\'S CHILDREN ARE STUDYING IN THE U.S., </p><p>MNANGAGWA SAID TWO, BOTH AT MIDLANDS UNIVERSITY IN TEXAS. </p><p>TWO DAYS LATER, THE SPEAKER PHONED THE AMBASSADOR TO SAY </p><p>THAT HE AND THE PRESIDENT HAD "FIXED" THE ELECTORAL ACT </p><p>CONCERNS WE HAD RAISED, SPECIFICALLY EXPUNGING THE </p><p>REQUIREMENT THAT ONLY CIVIL SERVANTS COULD SERVE AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03690  03 OF 06  121708Z </p><p>MONITORS.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED HIS OPENNESS TO FINDING A </p><p>MECHANISM WHEREBY POLITICAL PARTIES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ESC </p><p>DELIBERATIONS.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) WHEN KANSTEINER PRAISED THE GOZ DECISION TO EXTEND </p><p>THE VOTER REGISTRATION DEADLINE FROM DECEMBER 9 TO DECEMBER </p><p>19, MUDENGE SAID ZANU-PF NEEDED MORE TIME TO GETS ITS </p><p>SUPPORTERS REGISTERED.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID SOME GOOD </p><p>CHANGES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSED ELECTORAL ACT </p><p>AMENDMENTS.  ONE, FOR INSTANCE, WOULD PERMIT POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY AGENTS TO JOIN THE PRESIDING ELECTION OFFICIAL IN </p><p>CHECKING FOR INDELIBLE INK ON THE VOTER\'S HANDS -- TO </p><p>ENSURE THEY HAVE NOT ALREADY CAST A BALLOT -- AND TO </p><p>OBSERVE AT CLOSE-RANGE THE SEARCH FOR THE VOTER\'S NAME ON </p><p>THE REGISTER.  (NOTE: IN THE PAST, PARTY AGENTS HAVE HAD TO </p><p>STAND ACROSS THE ROOM AS LONG-DISTANCE SPECTATORS.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  MUDENGE SAID THE PRESIDING OFFICIAL, A POLICE </p><p>OFFICER, AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL\'S </p><p>OFFICE WOULD ENTER THE BOOTH WITH BLIND OR OTHERWISE </p><p>INCAPACITATED VOTERS TO HELP THEM MARK THE BALLOT FOR THE </p><p>CANDIDATE OF THEIR CHOICE.  KANSTEINER ASKED WHETHER </p><p>MUDENGE WAS CONCERNED THAT THE THREE PEOPLE HELPING SUCH </p><p>INDIVIDUALS TO VOTE ARE CIVIL SERVANTS WHO DEPEND ON </p><p>GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS.  "NO, MY FRIEND," MUDENGE </p><p>REPLIED, "MOST CIVIL SERVANTS ARE MDC SUPPORTERS WHO WILL </p><p>WORK TO ENSURE AN OPPOSITION VICTORY."  HE THEN TURNED TO </p><p>THE FOUR NOTETAKERS ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM AND SAID, "I </p><p>DON\'T KNOW FOR SURE, BUT I SUSPECT THAT THESE MEMBERS OF MY </p><p>STAFF PROBABLY WILL VOTE FOR THE MDC."  IT WOULD BE HARD TO </p><p>SELL THAT ARGUMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, </p><p>KANSTEINER WARNED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03690  03 OF 06  121708Z </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) MUDENGE CLAIMED THAT THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND </p><p>PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BILL WAS MODELED CLOSELY ON SIMILAR </p><p>LEGISLATION IN SOUTH AFRICA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.  TAKING </p><p>THE WORST OF TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION IS NOT NECESSARILY </p><p>THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION, KANSTEINER REMARKED.  THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THE PRESS SEEMED MOST WORRIED BY THE </p><p>PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF A MEDIA ETHICS COMMISSION, WHICH </p><p>WILL ENSURE THAT WHAT JOURNALISTS WRITE IS TRUTHFUL. </p><p>STRAIGHT-FACED, THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY SAID HE WAS WORRIED </p><p>ABOUT THE DRAFT LAW\'S IMPACT ON THE (GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED) </p><p>"THE HERALD," SINCE POLITICAL PARTIES WON\'T BE PERMITTED TO </p><p>RUN NEWSPAPERS AND "THE HERALD" IS AN INSTRUMENT OF ZANU- </p><p>PF.  "THE HERALD" IS PART OF THE PUBLIC MEDIA, MUDENGE </p><p>RETORTED -- "WE DON\'T RUN NEWSPAPERS."

HE ASKED WHY THE </p><p>ESC WAS NOT CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT, AND THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES TO HAVE INPUT.  MAKONI SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO </p><p>DISMISS USG CONCERNS, BUT HE THOUGHT THAT LACK OF TRUST AND </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM WERE THE REAL PROBLEM, NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY THE SUBSTANCE OF THE DRAFT LEGISLATION.  HE </p><p>THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IF GOVERNMENT SAT DOWN WITH </p><p>KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO WALK THROUGH THESE ISSUES.  PERHAPS, AS </p><p>A STARTING POINT, MNANGAGWA -- AS THE RULING PARTY\'S </p><p>SECRETARY FOR ADMINISTRATION -- AND MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WELSHMAN NCUBE COULD REACH AGREEMENT ON HOW THE TWO PARTIES </p><p>CAN COMPETE FAIRLY.

YES, MNANGAGWA SAID, HE </p><p>HAD ATTENDED THAT MEETING BUT WAS NOT SURE WHERE THE GOZ </p><p>STOOD ON THOSE NORMS AND STANDARDS.   MNANGAGWA DECLARED </p><p>THAT, AFTER THE ELECTION DATES ARE ANNOUNCED, POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES WILL BE ALLOCATED FREE RADIO AND TELEVISION TIME </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE PERCENTAGE OF SEATS THEY HOLD IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  ANY PARTY THAT WANTS ADDITIONAL TIME CAN </p><p>PURCHASE IT. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) MUDENGE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING THE SADC- </p><p>PF\'S ELECTORAL NORMS.  "PLEASE LEAVE OUT OUR COMMITMENTS TO </p><p>OUR SADC FRIENDS," HE SAID POINTEDLY.  "THAT\'S AN INTERNAL </p><p>DOCUMENT.  WE HAVE WAYS OF HELPING EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE </p><p>WANT TO GROW AS A REGION."  KANSTEINER AGREED WITH </p><p>MUDENGE\'S LATTER POINT, SAYING THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI SEEMED SO CONCERNED ABOUT EVENTS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  "LEAVE MBEKI," MUDENGE ASSERTED.  "I SPEAK TO </p><p>HIS MINISTER REGULARLY BUT, NOW, I WANT TO HEAR YOUR </p><p>CONCERNS."  "OUR CONCERNS ARE THEIR CONCERNS," KANSTEINER </p><p>REPLIED.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID SOUTH AFRICA IS </p><p>"TOTALLY OPPOSED" TO THE SANCTIONS THE UNITED STATES HAD </p><p>PLACED ON ZIMBABWE, WHICH HURTS ZIMBABWEANS AND DOES NOT </p><p>HELP OUR BILATERAL DIALOGUE.  KANSTEINER REITERATED THAT </p><p>THE USG HAS NOT IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON ZIMBABWE.

KANSTEINER REPLIED </p><p>THAT HIS OWN MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT, AND </p><p>MAINTAINED THAT ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC DECLINE HAS BEEN CAUSED </p><p>PRIMARILY BY GOVERNMENT MISMANAGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>DRC </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) KANSTEINER ATTRIBUTED PART OF ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>DECLINE TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE DRC.  "YOUR </p><p>PEOPLE HAVE PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR THAT MILITARY </p><p>INVOLVEMENT," KANSTEINER SAID, THROUGH WHICH THE GOZ HAD </p><p>ESSENTIALLY PLACED SANCTIONS ON ITS OWN PEOPLE.  MUDENGE </p><p>CONTENDED THAT THE GOZ HAD ENTERED THE CONFLICT IN THE DRC </p><p>AS A WAY TO THANK AFRICA FOR HELPING ZIMBABWEANS DURING </p><p>THEIR LIBERATION STRUGGLE.  KANSTEINER SAID THE GOZ NEEDED </p><p>TO DO A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING THE REASONS FOR ITS DRC </p><p>INVOLVEMENT TO THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE.   IF ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>TROOPS WITHDRAW, MUDENGE REPLIED, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WOULD </p><p>COLLAPSE.

HE REMINDED KANSTEINER THAT ZIMBABWE WAS IN </p><p>DRC AT THE REQUEST OF THE KINSHASA GOVERNMENT AND WOULD </p><p>WITHDRAW AS SOON AS KINSHASA ASKED THEM TO, "LUSAKA OR NO </p><p>LUSAKA." </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) MUDENGE SAID THAT, ALTHOUGH WE MAY HAVE OUR </p><p>DIFFERENCES ON DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS IN ZIMBABWE, THE GOZ </p><p>WANTS VERY MUCH TO WORK WITH THE UNITED STATES TO ENSURE </p><p>STABILITY IN THE DRC.  THE GOZ WANTED THE USG INVOLVED "IN </p><p>A BIG WAY," AS IT WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT CAN MAKE A REAL </p><p>DIFFERENCE THERE.  HE SAID THE GOZ REGULARLY INCORPORATES </p><p>OUR NON-PAPERS AND OTHER INFORMATION WE SHARE INTO THEIR </p><p>THINKING, AND SAID HE WAS AVAILABLE ANY TIME TO EXCHANGE </p><p>IDEAS ON THE WAY FORWARD.  KANSTEINER REPORTED THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH HAD HAD A GOOD MEETING IN NEW YORK WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT KABILA, AND HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO PRESS FORWARD </p><p>ON THE INTERNAL DIALOGUE.  MUDENGE SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED </p><p>TO HEAR THAT PRESIDENT MASIRE DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT </p><p>RESOURCES, AND INDICATED THAT A SADC MEETING MIGHT BE </p><p>CALLED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.  KANSTEINER SAID THE USG HAS </p><p>GIVEN HIM SOME RESOURCES AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICANS MAY HELP OUT AS WELL.  "LET\'S NOT DUMP THIS IN THE </p><p>LAP OF THE SOUTH AFRICANS," MUDENGE DECLARED.  IF THE UN </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL CANNOT COME UP WITH $6 MILLION FOR MASIRE, </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS SHOWING A REAL LACK OF </p><p>COMMITMENT.  THAT\'S WHY THE UNITED STATES WOULD HELP, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE UNSC DOES, KANSTEINER SAID.  MUDENGE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03690  05 OF 06  121710Z </p><p>REPORTED THAT THE GOZ IS TRYING TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH </p><p>RWANDA AND HAS HAD A NUMBER OF MEETINGS WITH JEAN-PIERRE </p><p>BEMBA.  ASKED HIS IMPRESSIONS OF BEMBA, MUDENGE CHUCKLED </p><p>AND SAID HE IS A "YOUNG MAN WHO KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS." </p><p> </p><p>THE BRITS ARE AGAINST US </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) MUDENGE CRITICIZED THE GOZ\'S FAVORITE WHIPPING </p><p>BOY, THE BRITISH, SAYING THE UK HAS "DESTABILIZED THE </p><p>LANDSCAPE" BY FUNDING THE OPPOSITION MDC.  BY BETTING ON </p><p>OUR ENEMIES, THEY HAVE MADE THEMSELVES THE GOZ\'S ENEMIES. </p><p>KANSTEINER EMPHASIZED THAT WE COULD NOT CARE LESS WHO WINS </p><p>THE ELECTION.  WE DO CARE HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED, HOWEVER, </p><p>AND HOW THE TRANSITION IS MANAGED.  THERE WON\'T BE A </p><p>TRANSITION, MUDENGE REPLIED, BECAUSE ZANU-PF WILL WIN THE </p><p>ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>GLOOMY ECONOMIC PICTURE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) MAKONI PRESENTED A GLOOMY PICTURE OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>MACROECONOMIC SITUATION.  HE EXPECTED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE </p><p>IN PLANTING OF KEY CROPS: THE NUMBER OF HECTARES OF TOBACCO </p><p>(ZIMBABWE\'S PRIMARY FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNER) PLANTED IS </p><p>DOWN 25 PERCENT OVER LAST YEAR, WHILE MAIZE PLANTINGS IN </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMING AREAS ARE DOWN 40 PERCENT.  HE HAD HOPED </p><p>THE SHORTFALL IN MAIZE PLANTINGS WOULD BE MADE UP IN </p><p>COMMUNAL AND RESETTLEMENT AREAS, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>THIS WAS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT </p><p>MAIZE PRODUCTION WOULD FALL SIGNIFICANTLY SHORT OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03690  05 OF 06  121710Z </p><p>ANNUAL CONSUMPTION REQUIREMENT OF 2.2 MILLION TONS.  THE </p><p>IMPOSITION OF PRICE CONTROLS HAD NOT HELPED MATTERS, MAKONI </p><p>SAID, AS BOTH COMMERCIAL AND SMALL-SCALE MAIZE FARMERS ARE </p><p>LIKELY HOLDING ONTO THEIR PRODUCT UNTIL THE PRICE IS RIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) THE FINANCE MINISTER SAID HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE </p><p>ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE FAST TRACK EFFORT, AND HAD URGED HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES TO SHOW FLEXIBILITY IN IMPLEMENTING IT.  GOZ </p><p>RHETORIC NOTWITHSTANDING, ONE COULD COUNT THE NUMBER OF </p><p>FARMERS WHO HAD INHERITED THEIR PROPERTIES ON ONE HAND. </p><p>MOST COMMERCIAL FARMERS HAD BOUGHT THEIR LAND SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE IN 1980, AFTER OBTAINING A CERTIFICATE OF NO </p><p>INTEREST FROM THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.  MAKONI SAID HE </p><p>WANTED COMMERCIAL FARMERS TO BE ABLE TO REINVEST EARNINGS, </p><p>NOT BE FORCED INTO DESTITUTION.  WHILE THERE CERTAINLY IS </p><p>AN ISSUE OF HISTORICAL INJUSTICE, THE GOZ NEEDS TO KEEP </p><p>THAT IN PERSPECTIVE.  SOME IN GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT BE SO </p><p>FRANK, MAKONI ADMITTED, BUT HE WAS THE ONE DEALING WITH THE </p><p>NUTS AND BOLTS OF THE COUNTRY\'S ENORMOUS ECONOMIC </p><p>DIFFICULTIES.  THE MINISTER EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>THE EXPOSURE OF ZIMBABWEAN BANKS, MOST OF WHICH HOLD </p><p>SIGNIFICANT AGRICULTURAL LOAN PORTFOLIOS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7930 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03690  06 OF 06  121709Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------4A8A36  121709Z /68 </p><p>O 121555Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0521 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 06 OF 06 HARARE 003690 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 12/12/11 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03690  06 OF 06  121709Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  A/S KANSTEINER DELIVERS TOUGH MESSAGE TO </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>21.
