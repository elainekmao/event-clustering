SUMMARY: THE WAR AGAINST IRAQ CONTINUES TO DOMINATE COVERAGE </p><p>IN UAE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  EDITORIALS VOICE OFFICIAL AND </p><p>PUBLIC CONCERN FOR THE SUFFERING OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  AN "AL- </p><p>KHALEEJ\' EDITORIAL NOTES THAT THE WAR SYMBOLIZES A DEFEAT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND HUMANITY AS A WHOLE.  LIKEWISE, AN "AL- </p><p>BAYAN" EDITORIAL CLAIMS THAT THE WAR REPRESENTS A DEATH </p><p>CERTIFICATE FOR THE UNITED NATIONS.  FINALLY, AN "AL-ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIAL SAYS THAT THE WAR WILL NOT STOP AS LONG AS THERE ARE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS IN THE IRAQI REGIME YEARNING ONLY FOR POWER AND BLIND </p><p>TO THE SUFFERING OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SEMI-OFFICIAL ABU DHABI-BASED ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/21: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT HAPPENED IS A CATASTROPHE ABOUT WHICH WE HAVE ALWAYS </p><p>WARNED, CALLED TO AVOID, AND URGED EFFORTS TO AVERT.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE RELUCTANCE OF SOME AND THE AGITATION OF OTHERS AT THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL, AND THE SHARP SPLIT IN DEALING WITH DANGEROUS </p><p>ISSUES SUCH AS IRAQ HAVE INCREASED THE TONE OF THE CHALLENGE ... </p><p>THUS INCREASING THE SUFFERINGS, HUNGER, AND THIRST OF THE </p><p>BROTHERLY IRAQI PEOPLE, FORCED TO LIVE THROUGH THIS THIRD </p><p>CATASTROPHIC ADVENTURE IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY ... </p><p>THE WAR HAS STARTED, WILL NOT STOP, AND WILL REMAIN SO AS LONG AS </p><p>THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS (IRAQI REGIME) WHOSE DESIRE FOR POWER HAS </p><p>BLACKED OUT THEIR EYES FROM SEEING THE SUFFERING OF THEIR OWN </p><p>PEOPLE ..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "A DEFEAT OF HUMANITY", SHARJAH-BASED PAN- </p><p>ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 3/21: </p><p> </p><p>"... BY THE STANDARDS OF MOST OF THE WORLD\'S NATIONS, LARGE AND </p><p>SMALL, AND AS MILLIONS VOICED THEIR CONCERNS IN TENS OF CITIES, </p><p>THIS WAR HAS BEEN DICTATED.  IT IS ILLEGAL AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY </p><p>LEGAL JUSTIFICATION.  IT IS A SPECIAL WAR LAUNCHED BY THE U.S. TO </p><p>ACHIEVE ITS GLOBAL OBJECTIVES OF CONTROL AND HEGEMONY, WHICH IN </p><p>OUR PART OF THE WORLD, MEET WITH THOSE OF INTERNATIONAL ZIONISM </p><p>... EVERY BULLET FIRED AT IRAQ CARRIES DEATH FOR ITS CIVILIANS. </p><p>HOW IS THE SITUATION THEN WHEN THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION HAS </p><p>BEEN PROMISING IRAQIS WITH THOUSANDS OF MUNITIONS INCLUDING SMART </p><p>BOMBS, THE MOTHER OF ALL BOMBS, THE ELECTROMAGNETIC BOMBS, AND </p><p>EVEN STRATEGIC NUCLEAR BOMB?  THE WAR HAS STARTED AND IT IS A </p><p>DREADFUL DEFEAT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW AND HUMANITY AS A WHOLE." </p><p> </p><p>4.  DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/21: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE MOST DANGEROUS ELEMENT IN THE AMERICAN AGGRESSION </p><p>AGAINST BROTHERLY IRAQ IS THE LACK OF RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAW.  IN FACT, AMERICA HAS ABANDONED ALL INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND </p><p>CHARTERS, AND THE ENTIRE WORLD HAS COME UNDER ITS CONTROL.  WE DO </p><p>NOT EXAGGERATE IF WE SAY THAT WHAT AMERICA DID YESTERDAY WAS A </p><p>DEATH CERTIFICATE FOR THE UNITED NATIONS SEALED WITH AN AMERICAN </p><p>STAMP ... THE WORLD IS IN CHAOS, AND FOR US, ARABS, IT WAS A SAD </p><p>DAY, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, ONE OF THOSE BLACK DAYS THAT WE ADD </p><p>TO OUR HISTORY RECORDS.  WE REMAIN AT A STANDSTILL, DISABLED, </p><p>YIELDING AS IF WE ARE SATISFIED WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING." </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION READ-OUT </p><p> </p><p>5.  A GENERAL MOOD OF CONCERN AND ANGER CONTINUES TO PREVAIL </p><p>AMONG MOST EMIRATIS AND LOCAL ARABS.  CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS </p><p>CONTINUE TO VOICE THEIR DEEP CONCERN FOR THE SITUATION.  ONE </p><p>CONTACT ASKED:  "DO YOU THINK SUCH A WAR WILL BRING DEMOCRACY TO </p><p>THE ARAB WORLD?  NO.  ALL IT BRINGS IS MORE HUMILIATION AND </p><p>DEFEAT FOR THE ARABS, MAINLY THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS, WHO KEEP </p><p>WONDERING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN ADULTS FIND IT DIFFICULT </p><p>TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION TO THEM.  HOW WOULD WE EXPLAIN THE </p><p>SURRENDER OF IRAQI SOLDIERS?  IT IS ALL DISGRACEFUL." </p><p>ALL CONTACTS REMAIN VERY WORRIED ABOUT "THE IRAQI PEOPLE, WHO </p><p>HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND CANNOT BEAR FURTHER TRAGEDIES." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
