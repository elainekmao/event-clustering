<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001356 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, SA/RA, PM/SA, INR </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USAID/ANE, NSC FOR MILLARD, LONDON FOR </p><p>POL/GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, EAID, PREL, CASC, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAOIST WARNING AGAINST US-AFFILIATED </p><p>PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The Maoists in Nepal reportedly have issued </p><p>a notice that all Nepali nationals affiliated with the United </p><p>States in Maoist-controlled areas would be subject to </p><p>harassment and travel restrictions.  Reports from many west </p><p>and mid-west districts have indicated that the Maoists\' edict </p><p>has been widely disseminated, and anectodal evidence suggests </p><p>that the Maoists have increased travel restrictions on Nepali </p><p>aid workers.  In the western District of Kalikot, a foreign </p><p>development worker was detained by the Maoists for </p><p>questioning, but later released.  U.S.-affiliated </p><p>organizations operating in affected areas have not reported a </p><p>change in treatment by the Maoists.  Despite the Maoist </p><p>edict, ongoing development programs in remote areas may not </p><p>encounter difficulty with the Maoists due to already </p><p>established relationships with local Maoist leaders.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 15, Post received a letter from the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army\'s Department of Military Intelligence indicating </p><p>that Maoists had issued "a notice stating that all personnel </p><p>who are working for or in any way related with the United </p><p>States of America are to undergo public prosecution and are </p><p>to be denied entry into the villages."  After questioning the </p><p>RNA on this matter, Post learned that the Maoists issued the </p><p>communique in writing two months ago.  It reportedly aimed at </p><p>Nepali nationals -- not Americans -- working in the </p><p>hinterlands, not the Kathmandu Valley. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 17, PolOff attended the World Food Program\'s </p><p>quarterly meeting reporting on the food security situation. </p><p>The WFP employs field officers in 30 heavily Maoist-affected </p><p>districts in Nepal.  According to WFP field reports, tensions </p><p>between the Maoists and Royal Nepal Army increased greatly in </p><p>June.  In response, the Maoists have tightened travel </p><p>restrictions in many west and mid-western districts.  In the </p><p>mid-western districts of Jumla, Kalikot, Humla and Mugu the </p><p>Maoists have reimposed pass systems for movement; if the </p><p>local Maoist leader does not approve a person\'s reason for </p><p>travel, that person is not allowed to leave the village, </p><p>reported WFP field officers.  In Humla, the pass system </p><p>reportedly was implemented as a response to the establishment </p><p>of army medical camps in the district.  In Jumla, the system </p><p>was established because of clashes between the RNA and </p><p>Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In line with previous Embassy reporting, Maoist </p><p>extortion activities continued to increase in all 30 of the </p><p>districts in which WFP has programs.  In Rasuwa and Nuwakot, </p><p>two districts north of Kathmandu, for example, Maoists </p><p>reportedly have doubled the amount of "donations" they </p><p>demand.  And in Jumla, Mugu and Rukum Districts, Maoists will </p><p>not allow any new development activity to be introduced </p><p>without their prior permission.  In the far-western district </p><p>of Bajura, local Maoists have started collecting funds from </p><p>government staff as well as from school teachers. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Both WFP field officers and other NGO attendees at </p><p>the briefing said that Maoists in all 30 WFP districts </p><p>recently had made it known that any development program </p><p>associated with the U.S. Government would not be allowed to </p><p>operate in these districts.  The week of June 24, a dual </p><p>American and New Zealand citizen working for a WFP </p><p>implementing partner, was detained by the Maoists in the </p><p>mid-western district of Kalikot and questioned in detail </p><p>about his citizenship.  The detainee said he felt threatened </p><p>by the Maoists, but was able to convince them that he was not </p><p>a U.S. citizen, after which he was released.  He also </p><p>informed PolOff of rumors prevalent in the Maoist-affected </p><p>areas that the Maoists intend to break the cease-fire not </p><p>because of actions taken by the Government of Nepal, but </p><p>because of U.S. and Indian "interferference" in the peace </p><p>negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In a July 17 Embassy security briefing for USAID </p><p>implementing partners, several U.S. - affiliated programs </p><p>suggested that despite increased tension in certain areas and </p><p>a high level of Maoist activity, they had encountered no </p><p>signficant difficulties in continuing on-going programs in </p><p>Maoist-affected areas.  For example, a Johns Hopkins </p><p>University-affiliated family nutrition program run by an </p><p>American in Sarlahi District has been able to continue to </p><p>care for newborns in areas administered solely by Maoist </p><p>insurgents.  All participants of the briefing were encouraged </p><p>to contact program colleagues and related partners to share </p><p>information on the recent Maoist notification. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment.  RNA reports that the Maoists intend to </p><p>"prosecute" and restrict the travel of individuals associated </p><p>with the United States are supported by anectodal evidence. </p><p>However, local implementation of this decision will vary </p><p>considerably across the country, depending on local Maoist </p><p>personalities and their relationship with ongoing development </p><p>programs.  Post has received no indication that the Maoists </p><p>intend to target individuals directly employed by the U.S. </p><p>Mission in Kathmandu.  However, in coordination with Nepal </p><p>security forces and other diplomatic missions, Post will </p><p>continue to seek information regarding the new Maoist policy </p><p>and how it might affect Mission security and development </p><p>activities.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
