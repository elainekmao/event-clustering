SUMMARY: The flagship of Quebec\'s aerospace industry, </p><p>Bombardier Inc., identifies itself as the number three </p><p>airplane maker after long-haul jet makers Boeing and Airbus. </p><p>But the company is known in the aerospace business as the </p><p>leading maker of corporate jets and regional jets (RJs), two </p><p>plane sectors that Bombardier helped to develop and has </p><p>dominated for the past decade.  The company is facing </p><p>increased competition in the RJ market, in the midst of </p><p>airline industry doldrums, and new CEO Paul Tellier\'s </p><p>efforts to increase company profits and shareholder value. </p><p> </p><p>3. At the Paris Air Show in June, Tellier attempted to </p><p>publicly downplay Bombardier\'s long-time rivalry with </p><p>Brazilian regional jet maker Embraer noting that </p><p>"adversarial relations with your competitors are </p><p>unnecessary" and signaling that neither cut-throat </p><p>discounting nor World Trade Organization proceedings are </p><p>part of his plans to revive Bombardier\'s fortunes.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Bombardier Restructuring </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. A C$24 billion transportation manufacturing conglomerate, </p><p>Bombardier Inc. has been in a precarious financial position </p><p>in recent years (REF A), with accumulated debt of C$14 </p><p>billion, falling profits and a declining stock price.  After </p><p>restating its 2001 earnings to just C$36 million from the </p><p>previously reported C$391 million, Bombardier declared a </p><p>C$615 million loss for 2002 in April.  President and Chief </p><p>Executive Paul Tellier (REF B) also announced layoffs of up </p><p>to 3,000 employees and efforts to sell some operations, </p><p>including its recreational products division and military </p><p>services operations.  Bombardier announced the sale of the </p><p>military division in June, for US$90 million, to L3 </p><p>Communications of New York.  The company expects to complete </p><p>the sale of its recreational division this summer at which </p><p>point Bombardier will consist primarily of two divisions, </p><p>aerospace and transportation. </p><p> </p><p>5. Bombardier Transportation, which accounted for 40 percent </p><p>or C$ 9.4 billion of Bombardier\'s total revenues for fiscal </p><p>year 2002, is experiencing growth.  Most of the </p><p>transportation division\'s employees -- 80 percent -- work in </p><p>Europe, where the company says it held 50 percent of the </p><p>market in FY 2002.  Despite last year\'s highly publicized </p><p>problems with Acela trains delivered to Amtrak (REF A), </p><p>Bombardier maintained a 28 percent share of the North </p><p>American market in FY 2002.  The transportation group last </p><p>year captured 21 percent of the total share of new orders </p><p>worldwide, including a 352-car, C$941 million order from the </p><p>Long Island Rail Road and a 100-car, C$378 million order </p><p>from NJ Transit.  This week, Bombardier announced a 298-car, </p><p>C$633 million order from Germany\'s Deutche-Bahn. </p><p> </p><p>6. Bombardier entered the aerospace industry only in 1986, </p><p>with the purchase of Canadair.  That acquisition was </p><p>followed by purchases of Short Brothers plc, of Belfast, </p><p>Northern Ireland in 1989, Learjet of Wichita, Kansas in 1990 </p><p>and finally, de Havilland in Downsview, Ontario in 1992 - </p><p>all primarily makers of small planes.  Bombardier\'s </p><p>aerospace focus initially had been the corporate jet market. </p><p>Corporate jets (also known as executive or business planes) </p><p>are typically purchased for use by senior executives, high- </p><p>level government officials or wealthy individuals; these </p><p>planes seat from 5 to 40 passengers and have a range of 1500 </p><p>to 6000 miles.  Deliveries of Bombardier corporate jets, </p><p>which peaked in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2001 at </p><p>203 jets, have sharply dropped off since then; Bombardier </p><p>delivered 162 business aircraft in FY 2002 and the company </p><p>delivered only 77 corporate jets in FY 2003.  Not </p><p>surprisingly, would-be U.S. buyers of these planes see them </p><p>as luxury purchases, easily postponed during economic </p><p>downturns. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Regional Jets </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. Though Bombardier unveiled three new business plane </p><p>models at the Paris Air Show in June, the company is clearly </p><p>focused on the Regional jet market.  Regional jets (RJs) are </p><p>defined as small-body commercial aircraft having 50 to 100- </p><p>passenger seats and an average 2000-mile range.  In recent </p><p>years, airlines have been increasing their use of RJs, as an </p><p>alternative to wide-body jets.  Some airlines have been able </p><p>to develop new passenger markets by offering service to </p><p>smaller cities through the use of these RJs, which are more </p><p>fuel-efficient and cost-effective than wide-body planes. </p><p>Right now, the regional jet is the only growth sector in the </p><p>commercial airplane manufacturing industry, according to </p><p>Chuck Evans, Director, Airline Industry Analysis and </p><p>Strategy Marketing, at Bombardier Aerospace.  Indeed, in </p><p>notes for his June 10 annual meeting speech, Tellier wrote, </p><p>"This aircraft [the RJ] is the cornerstone of the airline </p><p>industry restructuring.  The aircraft meets the airlines\' </p><p>needs.  There are more regional jets flying now than before </p><p>September 1, 2001." </p><p> </p><p>8. In 2002, Bombardier\'s CRJ line of planes accounted for 54 </p><p>percent of the total world RJ market and 44 percent of </p><p>Bombardier\'s total airplane production (56 percent of the </p><p>company\'s production was corporate jets).  The planes in </p><p>Bombardier\'s CRJ series can seat between 50 and 85 people </p><p>and have a 2000-mile range.  Atlanta-based Delta Connection </p><p>is the largest operator of CRJ\'s with over 273 in operation. </p><p>According to Evans, a major advantage of the CRJ line is </p><p>reduced pilot training time; all models use the same cockpit </p><p>configuration, making it possible for pilots to learn how to </p><p>fly a different CRJ model in just four days, instead of the </p><p>standard 30 days of training required to fly a new airplane </p><p>model. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Challenges to Growth in the Regional Jet Market </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9. The biggest challenges to growth in the North American </p><p>regional jet market have been airline pilots\' collective </p><p>agreements and airplane purchase financing for cash-strapped </p><p>airlines.  Union "scope" clauses, which protect higher pay </p><p>scales for pilots who fly long-haul jets, have limited </p><p>carriers\' ability to use RJs.  But U.S. pilot unions have </p><p>recently made large concessions on airlines\' use of RJs, </p><p>making these planes much more financially attractive.  The </p><p>financing of airplane purchases, however, through vendor </p><p>discounting, government loans and loan guarantees, and </p><p>private financing, continues to contribute to the overall </p><p>shaky picture of the aerospace industry.  Airlines most in </p><p>need of the RJs for restructuring purposes need financing to </p><p>purchase the more efficient planes.  Both Bombardier and its </p><p>Brazilian competitor Embraer are rumored to have heavily </p><p>"discounted" the purchase price of their planes in a US$4.3 </p><p>billion 170-jet order from US Airways.  The order, announced </p><p>in May, was split between the two plane manufacturers. </p><p> </p><p>10. The Export Development Bank of Canada (EDC), in its 2003 </p><p>report, noted its large loan exposure (33 percent) to the </p><p>aerospace industry (C$9.3 billion).  Atlantic Coast Airlines </p><p>and AMR Corp (American Airlines), both Bombardier clients, </p><p>account for 10 percent of the EDC exposure, and both </p><p>companies are reportedly on the brink of bankruptcy.  Evans </p><p>said that airlines continue to get purchase financing, but </p><p>was unwilling to say whether the financing for Bombardier </p><p>purchases was primarily offered by the vendor or from </p><p>private or government sources.  The Montreal Gazette </p><p>reported (7/5) that Britain\'s Export Credits Guarantees </p><p>Department plans to provide export credits for two loans </p><p>amounting to more than US$200 million, allowing two Delta </p><p>Air Lines subsidiaries to purchase Bombardier RJs </p><p>(Bombardier\'s Shorts plant in Northern Ireland qualifies the </p><p>company as a British exporter).  The Gazette pointed out </p><p>that Investissement Quebec, the provincial export promotion </p><p>vehicle, has also extended considerable loan guarantees to </p><p>Bombardier customers. </p><p> </p><p>11. Analysts believe the present plane financing situation </p><p>is unhealthy for both the aerospace and airline industries; </p><p>however, clearly it is more in Bombardier\'s interest for </p><p>governments to provide airplane financing than for the </p><p>company to engage in discounting and financing deals on its </p><p>own balance sheet.  Tellier has made a concerted effort to </p><p>pay down Bombardier\'s debt since January 2002, halving the </p><p>company\'s dividend and raising C$854 million in an April </p><p>sale of stock. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Rivalry with Embraer </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. Bombardier\'s chief competitor in the RJ market, Embraer, </p><p>has begun offering the Embraer 190, an RJ which seats 100 </p><p>passengers.  While the 190 has not yet flown in commercial </p><p>operation, New York-based JetBlue Airlines recently </p><p>purchased 100 of these planes.  "The sale of the 100-seaters </p><p>[Embraer] to JetBlue, has made us [Bombardier] think of re- </p><p>opening up development for BRJx," says Chuck Evans. </p><p>Bombardier had been developing the BRJx as its own 100-seat </p><p>RJ but shelved the project last year because of the downturn </p><p>in the U.S. airline market.  In Paris, Tellier confirmed </p><p>that Bombardier may relook at the BRJ-X program once the </p><p>company\'s economic problems are resolved.  Europe\'s Airbus </p><p>A318 and Boeing\'s B717, while marketed as regional jets, </p><p>have many wide-body characteristics and costs, and have not </p><p>yet acquired a major share of the RJ market.   Boeing </p><p>recently announced sale of 10 B717s to Airtran.  Reportedly, </p><p>Air Canada is looking at the Boeing 717s, among other RJs, </p><p>to revamp its fleet following its bankruptcy reorganization, </p><p>but most analysts think Bombardier, as a Canadian company, </p><p>would have an advantage over other manufacturers.  Air </p><p>Canada already operates 26 Bombardier RJs. </p><p> </p><p>13. Embraer and Bombardier\'s bitter rivalry has led to at </p><p>least five disputes at the World Trade Organization and </p><p>rulings against both the Canadian and Brazilian governments </p><p>for illegal subsidies to the companies.  At this year\'s </p><p>Paris Air Show, however, Tellier made headlines by paying a </p><p>courtesy call on Embraer CEO Mauricio Botelho.  Tellier </p><p>later told the press "adversarial relations with your </p><p>competitors are unnecessary."  He also made it known that </p><p>for the first time in more than six years, neither company </p><p>is interested in a new WTO complaint against the other.  The </p><p>WTO activity in this case concluded in December 2002 when </p><p>the WTO authorized Brazil to take trade countermeasures </p><p>against Canadian goods to the value of C$328 million. </p><p>Previously, in December 2000, the WTO authorized Canada to </p><p>take C$1.2 billion worth of countermeasures against </p><p>Brazilian products.  Neither Canada nor Brazil is expected </p><p>to impose the countermeasures, however, representatives of </p><p>the two governments continue to meet to discuss how they </p><p>might repair the damage to the bilateral relationship caused </p><p>by the dispute. </p><p> </p><p>14. Comment:  Tellier has made some difficult decisions in </p><p>his first six months as CEO at Bombardier.  While the </p><p>aerospace division has been criticized for not recognizing </p><p>the potential market for larger, 100-seat RJs, Tellier </p><p>appears willing to sacrifice market share in order to get </p><p>Bombardier\'s profit margins up, and increase shareholder </p><p>value.  While no one believes that Bombardier will give up </p><p>its fierce competition with Embraer, in seeking to lower the </p><p>profile of that competition, Tellier is signaling investors </p><p>that neither cut-throat discounting nor World Trade </p><p>Organization proceedings are part of his plans to revive </p><p>Bombardier\'s fortunes. </p><p> </p><p>ALLEN </p><p></p></div>
