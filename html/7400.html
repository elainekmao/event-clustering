<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001571 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PMAT. STATE PLEASE PASS TO NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL, JOINT STAFF, OSD/POLICY, USEUCOM, USSTRATCOM, </p><p>USPACOM, USTRANSCOM, USCENTCOM, USCOCOM, AND USSOUTHCOM </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01571  01 OF 02  131015Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, IT, MOPS, PREL, IT, IZ, IZMARR, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ITALIAN RESPONSE TO FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 93769 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION EMIL SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D </p><p>) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) SUMMARY. EMBASSY CONVEYED REFTEL POINTS TO GOI </p><p>OFFICIALS AT THE MOD, MFA, PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE AND </p><p>PRESIDENT CIAMPI\'S OFFICE ON APRIL 11.  INITIAL RESPONSES TO </p><p>OUR FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST WERE POSITIVE, BUT NOT YET </p><p>DEFINITIVE.  WE ARE ENCOURAGING THE GOI TO TAILOR A COMPONENT </p><p>OF THE PROPOSAL CRAFTED BY THE GOI\'S IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION TASK </p><p>FORCE  TO MORE PRECISELY MEET THE FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST. </p><p>THE PROPOSAL, WHICH INCLUDES MEDICAL SPECIALISTS AND MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL, WAS APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS THE </p><p>AFTERNOON OF APRIL 11.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) DEFMIN MARTINO\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR FRANCESCO TRUPIANO </p><p>SAID HE WOULD RAISE THE FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST WITH MARTINO </p><p>AND WITH THE ITALIAN DEFENSE GENERAL STAFF (IDGS), WHICH IS </p><p>ALREADY PREPARING A PACKAGE OF MILITARY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR </p><p>MARTINO\'S AND THE PRIME MINISTER\'S APPROVAL.  THE MFA\'S TASK </p><p>FORCE IS COORDINATING ALL OTHER ITALIAN CONTRIBUTIONS, HE </p><p>EXPLAINED, BUT THE MILITARY PACKAGE IS BEING ASSEMBLED </p><p>SEPARATELY BY MOD BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL SENSITIVITIES </p><p>STILL TIED TO ITALIAN MILITARY PARTICIPATION.  "NO ONE WILL </p><p>OPPOSE SENDING MEDICINE OR FOOD BUT EVEN ONE MILITARY </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01571  01 OF 02  131015Z </p><p>ENGINEER COULD CAUSE OBJECTIONS," HE SAID.  THE MFA TASK </p><p>FORCE COULD GET STARTED ON THE CIVILIAN HOSPITAL REQUEST </p><p>WHILE THE MOD DEALS WITH THE TRICKIER MILITARY PROTECTION </p><p>ASPECT, TRUPIANO SUGGESTED.  PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OR REVIEW </p><p>WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE NECESSARY FOR THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTION </p><p>BUT WOULD LIKELY BE NEEDED BEFORE ITALIAN SECURITY FORCES </p><p>COULD BE SENT IN, ACCORDING TO TRUPIANO. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) WE ALSO MET WITH FRANCESCO TALO, OF THE PRIME </p><p>MINSTER\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR\'S OFFICE, TO AMPLIFY REFTEL </p><p>REQUEST.  TALO SAID THAT THE PROPOSAL OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO ADDRESS PRESSING HUMANITARIAN NEEDS WHILE APPEALING TO </p><p>ITALIANS EAGER TO ASSIST IN THE POST-CONFLICT PHASE.  BEYOND </p><p>THAT, HOWEVER, HE WAS UNPREPARED TO COMMENT, PENDING FURTHER </p><p>DISCUSSION WITHIN THE PM\'S OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) IN ADDITION, WE BRIEFED THE REQUEST TO STEFANO </p><p>STEFANINI, DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISER TO PRESIDENT CIAMPI. </p><p>STEFANINI CONFIDENTLY PREDICTED THAT CIAMPI WOULD WELCOME A </p><p>POSITIVE RESPONSE BY THE GOI TO OUR REQUEST, AND WOULD </p><p>PERCEIVE NO/NO CONSTITUTIONAL OBSTACLES TO DEPLOYMENT OF </p><p>ITALIAN TROOPS IN SUPPORT OF SUCH A HUMANITARIAN MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) IN A MEETING WITH ECMIN, MFA DG FOR MIDDLE EAST </p><p>AFFAIRS (AND OFFICIAL COORDINATOR OF THE MFA\'S TASK FORCE FOR </p><p>IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION) ANTONIO BADINI ENTHUSIASTICALLY WELCOMED </p><p>THE FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST.  IT CLEARLY FITS WITHIN THE </p><p>PRIORITY AREAS IDENTIFIED BY THE TASK FORCE AND A THREE-PART </p><p>PACKAGE SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS FOR APPROVAL. </p><p>(NOTE: SUBSEQUENT TO THIS MEETING, DEPUTY TASK FORCE </p><p>COORDINATOR LUIGI MACCOTTA NOTIFIED US THAT THE COUNCIL </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01571  01 OF 02  131015Z </p><p>APPROVED THE PACKAGE THIS AFTERNOON.  END NOTE.)  THE FIRST </p><p>COMPONENT OF THE PACKAGE CONSISTS OF AN INTEGRATED 1,000 </p><p>PERSON TEAM DIVIDED BETWEEN SPECIALISTS IN HEALTH CARE AND </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AND MILITARY PERSONNEL DEPLOYED TO PROTECT THE </p><p>TEAM AND TO HELP STABILIZE THE LOCAL SITUATION.  THE MFA </p><p>PACKAGE ALSO PROPOSES PLACING ITALIAN EXPERTS WITH ORHA IN </p><p>NASCENT IRAQI MINISTRIES TO ASSIST WITH INSTITUTION </p><p>(RE)BUILDING.  THE FINAL COMPONENT CONSISTS OF ATTACHING, TO </p><p>THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, A SENIOR ITALIAN DIPLOMAT AND GENERAL TO </p><p>GENERAL GARNER\'S OPERATION TO FACILITATE COORDINATION WITH </p><p>THE GOI.  (FURTHER DETAILS REPORTED SEPTEL.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) COMMENT: THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE COUNCIL-APPROVED </p><p>PACKAGE COULD SERVE AS THE BASIS OF A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO </p><p>OUR FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH </p><p>THE GOI TO TAILOR ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO MEET THE SPECIFIC </p><p>NEEDS WE\'VE IDENTIFIED AND TO STRESS THE KEY REQUIREMENTS: </p><p>THAT THE MEDICAL UNIT BE SELF-SUSTAINING, SELF-PROTECTING, </p><p>UNDER CENTCOM COMMAND, AND AVAILABLE FOR DEPLOYMENT RIGHT NOW. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) COMMENT CONTINUED: WE BELIEVE THE GOI WILL DO ALL IT </p><p>CAN TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO THIS REQUEST.
