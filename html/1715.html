<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001196 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR: DS/DSS, DS/OP/AF, DS/DSS/ITA AND AF/EX </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  CRIMINAL INCIDENT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO CHANCERY </p><p>COMPOUND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) Summary: On Friday, May 18, 2001 at approximately </p><p>2000 hours an armed car-jacking occurred in close proximity </p><p>to the Chancery compound. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.    (U) The car-jacking occurred in front of the official </p><p>residence belonging to the Government of Nigeria (GON) </p><p>Minister of Aviation, located two blocks from the Chancery </p><p>compound.  The vehicle car-jacked, a late model Toyota Land </p><p>Cruiser sport utility vehicle, belonged to a Nigerian </p><p>citizen visiting the Minister of Aviation  residence.  The </p><p>car-jacking occurred after the driver dropped the owner of </p><p>the vehicle in front of the Minister  residence.  The </p><p>driver remained in the vehicle outside the Minister </p><p>residence, where he </p><p>was approached by at least two local </p><p>male subjects driving a white Peugeot 505 (no further </p><p>information).  The male subjects ordered the driver of the </p><p>Land Cruiser to drive away from the area at gunpoint, </p><p>directing him to remote area of Abuja.  The male subjects </p><p>ordered the driver to remove his clothing, before fleeing </p><p>with the vehicle and the driver  clothing </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The incident was reported to the police by the </p><p>owner of the vehicle after he came out of the Minster\'s </p><p>residence, and could not locate his vehicle and driver. </p><p>The driver later provided additional details regarding the </p><p>incident.  The Nigeria Police Force has established a </p><p>presence on the one street entering the area, consisting of </p><p>a tent, patrol car and officers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (U) The incident occurred on the same street as the </p><p>Chancery, beyond the view of the local guard force, but in </p><p>an area where Embassy employees park POVs.  The section of </p><p>the street passing in front of the Embassy compound is </p><p>secured by anti-ram drop-arm barriers.  The local guard </p><p>force personnel reported neither the robber  Peugeot 505 </p><p>nor the stolen Land Cruiser passed through the closed </p><p>portion of the street.  While the local guard force and </p><p>Nigerian Police presence likely deters criminals from </p><p>operating right in front of the Embassy, the knowledge of a </p><p>significant armed police presence about 100 yards away did </p><p>nothing to deter these criminals in this case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.   (U) The RSO has sent all Mission personnel a security </p><p>advisory regarding the incident.  The security posture at </p><p>the Chancery compound is good, due to the presence of the </p><p>local guard force and Nigerian Police personnel posted </p><p>immediately outside the Chancery.  During the core working </p><p>hours, there is also a plainclothes surveillance detection </p><p>presence working the area around the chancery.  During non- </p><p>working hours the surveillance detection guards are </p><p>assigned to Post  residential compounds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) However, the local guard force presence is </p><p>inadequate to cover areas beyond the drop arm barrier </p><p>gates.  Many mission employees (including USDH) are forced </p><p>to park in areas away from the Embassy compound and beyond </p><p>the line of local guards\' sight.  The RSO is considering </p><p>additional local guard force personnel to ensure the </p><p>security of Mission personnel walking to/from their </p><p>vehicles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Direct any questions regarding the above matter to </p><p>Michael E. Bishop, RSO, U.S. Embassy Abuja, Nigeria at 234- </p><p>9-523-0960. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
