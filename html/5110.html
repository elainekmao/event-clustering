Dailies </p><p>expect construction work to be completed in 45 days. </p><p>"Hurriyet," citing the Russian TASS news, claims that Prime </p><p>Minister Gul found support in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria </p><p>for his peace initiative>  This support encouraged the PM to </p><p>send a message to Saddam Hussein urging him to step down. </p><p>Prime Minister Gul and TGS Chief Gen. Ozkok said after a </p><p>meeting on Monday that the Turkish government and military </p><p>would work together for a peaceful solution to the Iraq </p><p>crisis.  "Cumhuriyet" comments that Prime Minister Gul\'s </p><p>Middle East tour has shown that Jordan, Syria, Iran and </p><p>Saudi Arabia - the countries to be directly affected by a </p><p>war against Iraq -- agree that Iraq\'s territorial integrity </p><p>should be preserved.  Turkish Businessmen\'s Association </p><p>(TUSIAD) Chairman Ozilhan criticized the government for </p><p>indecisiveness on Iraq and attempts to increase cooperation </p><p>with the totalitarian regime in Baghdad.  Prime Minister Gul </p><p>responded by saying that businessmen should be careful in </p><p>their criticism, and noted that the government was </p><p>discussing the issue with the U.S.. </p><p>Cyprus: U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator Tom Weston met with </p><p>MFA deputy U/S Baki Ilkin on Monday.  Papers report Weston </p><p>as saying that the U.S. has always supported a compromise </p><p>acceptable to Turkey, a close friend and ally. </p><p>Parliamentary Speaker Arinc, visiting the Turkish Republic </p><p>of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) with 20 parliamentarians, met with </p><p>Denktas on Monday.  Denktas complained that no Turks would </p><p>remain on the island if the UN plan is accepted unchanged, </p><p>and blamed the Greek Cypriots for using the EU shield to </p><p>take control of the island, reports say.  Turkish Cypriot </p><p>NGOs are expected to stage a rally of about 80,000 in </p><p>Lefkosa today in support of the UN peace plan and EU </p><p>membership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Pearson: MFA U/S Ambassador Ziyal briefed U.S. </p><p>Ambassador Robert Pearson about Prime Minister Gul\'s </p><p>meetings in the Middle East, papers report.  Dailies say </p><p>that Amb. Pearson sees no trouble in Turkey-U.S. relations, </p><p>and is confident that the two countries will work out a </p><p>compromise regarding U.S. requests for cooperation against </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economy: Turkish Businessmen\'s Association (TUSIAD) Chairman </p><p>Ozilhan criticized the AKP government for lack of </p><p>coordination, contradictory statements by government </p><p>officials, actions against the spirit of the economic reform </p><p>program, and lack of dialogue with the bureaucracy, the </p><p>opposition, and civilian organizations.  `The government </p><p>must refrain from actions which threaten financial </p><p>discipline and the fight against inflation,\' Ozilhan warned. </p><p>On the other hand, Deputy Prime Minister Sener reportedly </p><p>said that a number of state enterprises would be liquidated. </p><p>Sener said that the AKP government was considering </p><p>privatization of the Istanbul Stock Exchange (IMKB), the </p><p>Istanbul Gold Exchange, the National Lottery, motorways, </p><p>Halkbank, and energy distribution firms in order to achieve </p><p>a target of $4 billion in privatization revenues in 2003. </p><p>IMF First Deputy Director Anne Krueger is due in Istanbul on </p><p>Wednesday for meetings with economic officials.  World Bank </p><p>Vice President Johannes Linn is expected in Ankara on </p><p>January 16.  Papers report that the WB will provide Turkey a </p><p>$5 billion loan in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US-Turkey and Iraq" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna criticized the Turkish trade mission to </p><p>Baghdad in mass appeal-conservative Turkiye (1/14): "The US </p><p>clearly asks for Turkey\'s full support.  The nature of </p><p>support requires Parliament\'s approval and it is interesting </p><p>to see that the government has not yet applied for that </p><p>mandate. . It is certain that the US will execute this </p><p>operation (against Iraq) and Turkey should make its plans </p><p>accordingly.  In the meantime, the increasing remarks from </p><p>Washington, such as busy phone lines at the White House, </p><p>should be interpreted as `friendly warnings\' not threats. . </p><p>The Turkish trade mission has miscalculated the immediate </p><p>future of Iraq.  Following the military operation, the US </p><p>will remain in the country and Turkish businessmen might be </p><p>faced with the reality of not getting any of the rebuilding </p><p>projects.  Because in a few months, our immediate border </p><p>neighbor will be the US not Iraq." </p><p>"Minister Tuzmen, the Officious" </p><p>Hasan Cemal opined in mass appeal Milliyet (1/14): "The </p><p>trade mission to Baghdad headed by State Minister Tuzmen is </p><p>clearly annoying.  Saddam Hussein is desperate to gain </p><p>legitimacy and the Turkish Minister is just presenting him a </p><p>gift.  . Even Saddam knows the current dimension of Turkish- </p><p>American relations, yet it seems Minister Tuzmen is not </p><p>aware of it.  . Working for peace is certainly is a good </p><p>thing as long as one can set up the priorities.  First of </p><p>all, Iraq\'s near future means America, not Saddam. </p><p>Secondly, the UN embargo against Iraq still continues and </p><p>agreements with Iraq are doomed to remain on paper. </p><p>Thirdly, Saddam is no friend of Turkey.  Yet Turkey and the </p><p>US are two friends and allies with a strategic partnership. </p><p>Last but not least, Turkey managed to overcome a grave </p><p>economic crisis with the help and support of the US.  The </p><p>officious ones should know these facts well." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
