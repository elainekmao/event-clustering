<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004682 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: RE-INTEGRATION LAW FOR PKK/KADEK ON HOLD </p><p>FOR NOW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4499 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charges d\'Affaires Robert S. Deutsch. </p><p>Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Ruling AK Party July 23 withdrew from the floor of </p><p>Parliament a "reintegration" law that would have reduced </p><p>sentences for PKK/KADEK combatants and members of other </p><p>terrorist organizations who agree to lay down their arms and </p><p>provide information to authorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) During Parliamentary debate on the bill, opposition </p><p>CHP M.P.s called for qualified majority voting (i.e., the </p><p>motion would need a 3/5 majority to pass or 330 votes), </p><p>because, they argued, the draft amounted to an amnesty. </p><p>(note: according to Parliament by-laws, all amnesties require </p><p>qualified majority voting in Parliament. end note)  Deputy </p><p>speaker of Parliament and CHP M.P. Yilmaz Ates, who was </p><p>chairing the session, agreed to the CHP request.  In the </p><p>event, of the 392 deputies in attendance, 313 voted in favor, </p><p>while 77 voted against and two abstained.  The M.P.s largely </p><p>voted along party lines; relatively few crossed the aisle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The press reports that AK will send the draft back to </p><p>Parliament committees for review.  Justice Minister and </p><p>government spokesman Cemil Cicek told reporters after the </p><p>vote that the government is likely to submit the proposal to </p><p>Parliament again on July 25. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Reftel noted: 1) the proposed draft\'s apparent </p><p>weaknesses as they are seen by human rights and other Kurdish </p><p>groups; and 2) opposition from CHP, which is against the idea </p><p>in general.  In a July 23 meeting with poloff, Mesut Deger -- </p><p>a CHP Central Administrative board member and Kurdish M.P. -- </p><p>offered a more thoughtful critique from his party\'s </p><p>perspective.  Deger explained that while he is in favor of </p><p>reintegrating PKK/KADEK members into Turkish society, the </p><p>current draft would also reduce the sentences, or even set </p><p>free, members of Turkish Hizbullah and the perpetrators of a </p><p>1993 Sivas incident, in which a number leftist activists and </p><p>Alevis were killed.  Deger offered that if the bill is </p><p>changed to exclude these groups, CHP may change its stance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) We will continue to monitor closely the legislative </p><p>process on this issue. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
