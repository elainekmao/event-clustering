(SBU) Summary: Honduras can be expected to fight hard in </p><p>the U.S.-CAFTA textile negotiations for rules of origin that </p><p>allow use of fabrics produced in NAFTA, Central American, </p><p>CBI and Andean countries, including allowing the manufacture </p><p>of woven products, short supply provisions and flexible </p><p>rules of origin mechanisms such as accumulation.  The GOH </p><p>will continue to insist on maintaining special import </p><p>regimes after tariffs in the U.S.-CAFTA region are </p><p>eliminated because of their interest in short supply </p><p>provisions and Honduras\' belief that the free trade zones </p><p>are a key reason for Honduras\' success in the sector to </p><p>date.  In addition, many Honduran firms (even those which do </p><p>not export) have come to consider the tax exemptions an </p><p>entitlement.  Unless the government\'s fiscal woes worsen </p><p>significantly, we expect the GOH to insist on maintaining </p><p>its "WTO right" to provide these tax incentives to </p><p>investors. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>The Maquila Industry </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The attraction of the apparel assembly and related </p><p>maquila operations has been one of Honduras\' few success </p><p>stories in diversifying from traditional agricultural </p><p>exports such as bananas and coffee.  The sector was expected </p><p>to expand at double-digit rates after the adoption of </p><p>expanded Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) </p><p>benefits in the U.S. but instead contracted for two years </p><p>due to the downturn in the U.S. economy.  The importance of </p><p>the sector to job creation and export earnings and the need </p><p>to remain competitive after the planned elimination of </p><p>worldwide textile and apparel quotas in 2005 make expanded </p><p>market access for Honduran textiles and apparel its most </p><p>important goal in U.S.-CAFTA negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Accumulated investment in the sector in 2002 totaled </p><p>USD 1.422 billion, with USD 981.12 million in foreign </p><p>investment.  Accumulated U.S. investment in the sector is </p><p>estimated at 568.8 million, or 40 percent of the total </p><p>maquila investment.  Currently, there are approximately 66 </p><p>U.S. textile companies in Honduras with the most prominent </p><p>being Fruit of Loom, Sara Lee, Russell, Hugger, Dickies and </p><p>Jockey.  Honduran companies account for some USD 440.8 </p><p>million, or 31 percent of total industry investment.  The </p><p>rest of the investment is principally split between Korean, </p><p>Canadian, Taiwanese and Chinese companies. </p><p> </p><p>Origin of Accumulated Investment in 2002 (USD Millions) </p><p> </p><p>U.S.      568.80 </p><p>Honduras  440.80 </p><p>Korea     213.30 </p><p>China     56.88 </p><p>Canada    49.20 </p><p>Taiwan    28.44 </p><p>Singapore 18.80 </p><p>Other     45.78 </p><p> </p><p>Source: Honduran Maquila Association </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The downturn in the U.S. economy since 2001 has led </p><p>to maquila closings, net job losses in the sector and lower </p><p>than expected earnings for 2002.  Total employment in the </p><p>sector by December 2002 totaled 107,000 (approximately 26 </p><p>percent of the country\'s private sector workforce).  The </p><p>industry had grown to over 125,000 in 2000 and officials </p><p>predicted that maquila employment would double by 2005 to </p><p>250,000 jobs.  However, that estimate has been substantially </p><p>lowered to around 150,000 by 2005. </p><p> </p><p>Industry Employment </p><p> </p><p>1995       65,000 </p><p>1996       76,000 </p><p>1997       87,000 </p><p>1998      110,000 </p><p>1999      120,000 </p><p>2000      125,000 </p><p>2001      110,000 </p><p>2002      107,000 </p><p>Source: Honduran Maquila Association </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Maquila sector exports have more than doubled since </p><p>1995 when the industry registered USD 921 million in sales. </p><p>In 2002, exports decreased to USD 2,287.6 billion compared </p><p>to USD 2.344 billion in 2001.  However, Honduras is still </p><p>the third ranked exporter of textiles worldwide, following </p><p>Mexico and China. </p><p> </p><p>Exports (USD millions) </p><p> </p><p>1995        921.1 </p><p>1996      1,219.5 </p><p>1997      1,659.0 </p><p>1998      1,855.1 </p><p>1999      2,158.3 </p><p>2000      2,361.8 </p><p>2001      2,344.2 </p><p>2002      2,287.6 </p><p> </p><p>Source: Honduran Maquila Association </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The unilateral preferences provided by the USG to </p><p>Honduran apparel industry through the Caribbean Basin </p><p>Initiative (CBI) and related programs helped launch the </p><p>growth in the industry in Honduras.  According to the GOH, </p><p>Honduras\' exports to the U.S. of textiles and apparel grew </p><p>from 27 percent of total exports to the U.S. in 1990 to 70 </p><p>percent of total exports to the U.S. in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) GOH officials also emphasize in their discussions on </p><p>the sector that the U.S. and Central American textile </p><p>markets have become more and more interrelated.  They cite </p><p>the figure that U.S. cotton yarn exports to Honduras doubled </p><p>in the period from 2001 to 2002, after passage of the Trade </p><p>Development Act. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>U.S-CAFTA Negotiating Goals </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In February 4, 2003 written testimony by the </p><p>Embassy of Honduras before the U.S. International Trade </p><p>Commission on investigation 332-338, the Honduran Embassy </p><p>spelled out the GOH\'s negotiating goals on textiles bluntly: </p><p> </p><p>-- Allow for the development of a seamless hemispheric </p><p>textile and apparel industry; </p><p>-- Establish rules of origin that are flexible enough to </p><p>allow the use of fabrics produced in NAFTA, Central America, </p><p>CBI and Andean countries and which will allow the </p><p>manufacture of woven products; </p><p>-- Rules of origin that include provisions such as TPL\'s, </p><p>required percentages of regional and U.S. fabric, or inputs </p><p>(accumulation), or similar mechanisms that will allow the </p><p>integrated U.S.-Central American textile industry to use </p><p>cost competitive fabrics; </p><p>-- Integrate and simplify the custom compliance and security </p><p>programs for Central America so the region\'s industry can be </p><p>competitive; </p><p>-- Establish technical provisions for qualifying textiles </p><p>and apparel that will allow, among other procedures, dyeing, </p><p>finishing and printing of all fabrics in the region; access </p><p>for woven fabrics and commercially reasonable use of short </p><p>supply provisions. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Drawback and Free Trade Zones </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Hondurans firmly believe that, in addition to the </p><p>U.S.\'s CBI and CBTPA programs, the country\'s success as the </p><p>number three exporter of textiles to the U.S. is rooted in </p><p>its three free trade zone regimes.  During the negotiations </p><p>leading up to the launch of the Doha Agenda, one of the </p><p>GOH\'s main goals was to secure agreement on its "right," </p><p>under Article 7 of the Subsidies Agreement, to continue to </p><p>operate free trade zones and provide related investment </p><p>incentives, for 10 years.  Note: Honduras still has a per </p><p>capita income under the Article 7 cap of USD 1000 but this </p><p>level should be exceeded in the next couple of years; in </p><p>addition, it should be noted that international financial </p><p>institutions believe the Honduran GDP is generally </p><p>understated. End Note.  The Honduran Finance Ministry and to </p><p>a lesser extent the rest of the GOH is aware that the web of </p><p>tax waivers provided through these programs and many other </p><p>special laws is costing the government dearly in foregone </p><p>tax receipts.  These revenue losses in turn have contributed </p><p>to budget deficits, failure to meet IMF targets and the </p><p>postponement of its HIPC debt relief).  Nonetheless, they </p><p>continue to argue fiercely that the free trade zones are </p><p>indispensable to Central America\'s continued </p><p>competitiveness.  It should also be recognized that in the </p><p>current domestic political environment, a U.S.-CAFTA </p><p>agreement which forced the removal of these tax exemptions </p><p>from so many of the country\'s prominent Honduran investors </p><p>(30-40 percent of the investment is Honduran) would not be </p><p>considered viable, no matter how attractive other benefits </p><p>might be. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The three principal free trade zone regimes are: </p><p> </p><p>-- Temporary Importation regime (Regimen de importacion </p><p>temporal or RIT).  Benefits are provided to Honduran-owned </p><p>producers of any kind of product or service.  The regime was </p><p>set up in the 1980s in order to provide Honduran national </p><p>non-traditional exporters with tax incentives given in </p><p>previous years to foreign investors (however, over the years </p><p>implementation has been lax and many producers for the local </p><p>market have also been given these RIT exemptions).  Customs </p><p>benefits include: tax-free importation of all raw materials, </p><p>intermediate goods, and capital goods exclusively related to </p><p>production.  These companies were also exempt from income </p><p>tax until 1994.  The beneficiaries are allowed to sell </p><p>inputs, intermediate goods and final goods to other </p><p>companies, free of sales tax.  The beneficiaries can buy </p><p>locally made goods used directly in production process and </p><p>receive either an exemption from sales tax or an income tax </p><p>credit.  Approximately 530 Honduran establishments are </p><p>incorporated under the RIT regime, of which close to 100 </p><p>produce raw material, 150 produce food products and 120 </p><p>produce textiles and apparel. </p><p> </p><p>-- Free Processing Industrial Zones (Zonas Industriales de </p><p>Libre Procesamiento or ZIP) and Free Zones (Zona Libre or </p><p>ZOLI).  The ZIP industrial parks house only manufacturing </p><p>companies producing for export, which engage in </p><p>transformation of imported imports into final exported </p><p>products.  There are currently eight operating ZIP companies </p><p>which house 48 assembly plants.  Enterprises established </p><p>under the ZOLI regime receive similar benefits, but do not </p><p>have to be located in a special zone or industrial park. </p><p>Companies in ZIPs and ZOLIs are exempt from paying import </p><p>duties on raw materials, intermediate products, and capital </p><p>goods, and these do not need to be linked directly to the </p><p>productive process.  ZIP companies are exempt from the </p><p>national income tax for 20 years, and from municipal taxes </p><p>for 10 years.  ZOLI firms have permanent exemptions from </p><p>income tax and municipal taxes.  The companies are also </p><p>provided unrestricted currency conversion and customs </p><p>clearance is performed on-site (by contracted customs </p><p>officials whose salaries are paid by the company). </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) A recent IDB sponsored study of Honduran tax </p><p>policy found that in the year 2000, the special free trade </p><p>zone regimes resulted in 47 million lempiras (USD 3.25 </p><p>million) in waived export duties and 553 million (USD 37.9 </p><p>million) in waived sales taxes.  Of these amounts, the </p><p>majority of tax exemptions (39 million lempiras in customs </p><p>duties and 467 million lempiras in waived sales taxes) went </p><p>to Honduran companies under the RIT system.  There is no </p><p>estimate of waived duties for companies operating in the ZIP </p><p>and ZOLI regimes.  The study identified a negligible amount </p><p>(around USD 150) in drawback refunded to companies in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The study also identified several flaws with the </p><p>current system of investment incentives for exporting firms. </p><p>Of particular note is the fact that foreign firms with </p><p>assembly plants tend to treat their Honduran plants as a </p><p>cost center.  Their profits are therefore not attributable </p><p>to their Honduran activities and they would generally be </p><p>reflected in the company\'s consolidated income statements in </p><p>their home country.  For these foreign firms, the income tax </p><p>exemptions are considered redundant and unnecessary to </p><p>encourage foreign investment.  In other cases, it is </p><p>possible that the signing of a Double Taxation agreement </p><p>with the U.S. and other investor countries could help spur </p><p>additional foreign investment without forfeiting tax </p><p>revenues.  The GOH has recently asked the Embassy for more </p><p>information on requesting that the Department of Treasury </p><p>negotiate a Double Taxation treaty.  Finally, many other </p><p>Honduran laws have been enacted over the years giving a </p><p>variety of sectors and individual companies special import </p><p>duty and other tax exemptions. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Another reason for the Honduran insistence on the </p><p>maintenance of special import regimes, even after </p><p>negotiating U.S.-CAFTA, lies in their negotiating goal of </p><p>obtaining U.S. market access for woven fabrics and goods and </p><p>use of short supply provisions (that allow duty free </p><p>treatment of Central American products made from non-U.S. or </p><p>regional fabric if that product is not available from </p><p>regional sources).  Honduran trade officials note that the </p><p>NAFTA has such provisions.  If U.S.-CAFTA includes short </p><p>supply provisions, Honduran companies would want to continue </p><p>to import the fabric through special import regimes. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) GOH trade officials reject the argument that </p><p>continued use of duty waivers for non-U.S. or regional </p><p>fabric will provide a platform for circumvention of the </p><p>rules of origin requirements.  Honduras has done fairly well </p><p>over the years in U.S. Customs Service inspections of </p><p>compliance with CBI and CBTPA rules. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Customs Compliance and Security </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) The U.S. Customs Service\'s new rules on 24 hour </p><p>advance manifests and expectations of additional port </p><p>security requirements are of great concern to the Honduran </p><p>textile and apparel industry, which specializes in quick </p><p>deliveries because of its proximity to the U.S. market. </p><p>Puerto Cortes and the Honduran  textile and apparel sector </p><p>would benefit tremendously from cooperation on port </p><p>security, and if possible, initiation of a Container </p><p>Security Initiative program in Puerto Cortes. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
