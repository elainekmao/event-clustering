<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000465 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL ECONOMIC PESSIMISM: "MUDDLING THROUGH" AS </p><p>THE UPSIDE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2151 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: While not quite so pessimistic as they </p><p>were two weeks ago about Turkey\'s immediate economic </p><p>prospects, Istanbul financial analysts remain decidedly </p><p>gloomy about the country\'s mid-term future.  All agree that </p><p>the Treasury seems to have next week\'s debt auction well in </p><p>hand.  In the mid-term, however, there is consensus that 30 </p><p>percent real interest rates are not sustainable, and will </p><p>shift for better or worse.  Though an upside is "technically </p><p>possible," in the words of former Disbank Chairman Vural </p><p>Akisik, such an evolution would require government </p><p>credibility in the markets, currently a sorely lacking </p><p>commodity.  Akisik and others stressed that at root (and </p><p>counterintuitively) the problem is not fiscal.  Turkey today </p><p>enjoys the best economic fundamentals it has had in a decade. </p><p> But without unstinting government commitment to </p><p>half-heartedly accepted and long-delayed structural reforms, </p><p>interest rates will not come down to a sustainable level. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Less short-term angst...: In a round of meetings </p><p>during the week of March 31 with visiting Ankara DCM, Ankara </p><p>Econ Counselor, and Istanbul Pol/Econ Chief, financial and </p><p>real sector interlocutors indicated that their concerns had </p><p>eased about the short-term sustainability of Turkey\'s debt. </p><p>All agreed that the Treasury should be able to roll over the </p><p>4.8 quadrillion TL in treasury bills that come due on April </p><p>9.  Analysts point to several factors: most importantly, the </p><p>country\'s sentiment-driven markets, initally alarmed by a </p><p>perceived breach in U.S.-Turkish relations at a time the </p><p>country appeared increasingly isolated in Europe, have been </p><p>calmed by Secretary Powell\'s visit and the proposed 1 billion </p><p>USD assistance package.  A range of technical factors also </p><p>provide a safety margin to the Treasury: tax collections in </p><p>March and April should provide some ready cash, while the </p><p>state banks (little used in recent auctions)  can step in as </p><p>a last resort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ...but long-term gloom: Our interlocutors concurred, </p><p>however, that in the medium to long-term it is hard to be </p><p>hopeful.  ING Barings Managing Director John McCarthy noted </p><p>that given the current situation, one is "stretched for </p><p>positive arguments" about Turkey\'s situation.  With the </p><p>economy at a standstill, the country is coming to a "dark </p><p>time," he warned, and will have to seriously face up to the </p><p>structural issues it has long ducked, or face a crisis along </p><p>the lines of Mexico in the 1990s.  Others were similarly </p><p>pessimistic--Bender analysts Murat Gulkan and Emin Ozturk see </p><p>"muddling through" as the best case scenario for Turkey, and </p><p>can see no scenario for growth in the mid-term.  Ozturk noted </p><p>that there are few engines for growth this year (only exports </p><p>seem poised for a positive performance, while consumption, </p><p>public sector investment and tourism are all down), and a </p><p>business decision to draw down inventories (which accounted </p><p>for a large proportion of the growth in the fourth quarter of </p><p>2002) could cause the economy to contract. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Positive fundamentals, but: Gulkan and Ozturk </p><p>stressed that at root the problem is not fiscal, given that </p><p>Turkey currently enjoys the best economic fundamentals it has </p><p>seen in a decade.  Continued strong performance on the fiscal </p><p>side is a necessary but not sufficient condition for turning </p><p>the economy around.  Instead, they argued, the government </p><p>must stop sending mixed signals to the markets and instead </p><p>push the reform program wholeheartedly.  Former Disbank </p><p>Chairman Vural Akisik echoed this point, noting that Turkey\'s </p><p>macro base is better than it has been since 1994.  Because of </p><p>that, observers believe the government can get through the </p><p>next months by "spending the ammunition" it has accumulated. </p><p>But to achieve a sustainable real interest rate (which Akisik </p><p>calculates at 35 percent), the government must have </p><p>credibility with the markets, something that is now almost </p><p>totally lacking.  Reviewing the missed opportunities and </p><p>missteps that have characterized the last few months, Akisik </p><p>likened the situation to that of a husband who has cheated on </p><p>his wife and now even when guiltless must pay attention to </p><p>every nuance.  In such a situation it is not enough that the </p><p>government get the main issues right--the details must be </p><p>perfect too. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Captive audience: Many of our interlocutors concur </p><p>that ultimately a restructuring of Turkey\'s domestic debt-- </p><p>either orderly or chaotic--is inevitable.  They do not expect </p><p>it soon, however.  Most believe that the government can </p><p>sustain the debt through 2003.  Questions deepen for the </p><p>following years, and one leading international bank has </p><p>adjusted its baseline scenario to reflect a 2005 default as </p><p>the most likely outcome.  HSBC General Manager Antika concurs </p><p>that restructuring is inevitable, but she (and the bank\'s </p><p>Treasurer) do not see it happening this year.   Indeed, she </p><p>noted that HSBC\'s own interests militate against such a </p><p>development, in that they mirror (though to a lesser degree) </p><p>the predicament of the sector as a whole.  With exposure to </p><p>Turkish debt both on its balance sheet and in collateral for </p><p>corporate loans, as HSBC\'s Treasurer told us, "we have an </p><p>interest in keeping the boat afloat, not in profiteering from </p><p>the situation."  Other banks\' situation is similar.  Bender\'s </p><p>Ozturk and Gulkan stressed (as they have repeatedly in recent </p><p>months) that Turkish banks are captives of the system, and </p><p>are essentially prevented from cashing out, since a decision </p><p>by one bank to do so could bring the whole "house of cards" </p><p>down. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Restructuring: Intriguingly, however, we heard this </p><p>week our first hint that the banks themselves may be </p><p>receptive to some sort of controlled restructuring, in an </p><p>effort to escape the treadmill on which they find themselves. </p><p> Bank of New York Representative Neslihan Tombul told us on </p><p>April 3 that she has heard that at least two banks (Isbank </p><p>and Garanti) have sent feelers to the Treasury on the </p><p>subject.  Beyond the costs a restructuring might impose, </p><p>depending on how it is formulated, she also sees benefits, in </p><p>that with longer-term securities banks have a more stable </p><p>balance sheet on which to operate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment: With reassurance on U.S.-Turkish ties </p><p>helping to soothe Turkish markets in the short term, </p><p>attention is again focused on the key imponderable of </p><p>government credibility.  We see little sign that the </p><p>government will be able to recoup that commodity any time </p><p>soon.  Given its missteps, each government move has been </p><p>closely scrutinized, and in many cases (as in the case of </p><p>recent nominations to the board of Halkbank and Ziraat Bank) </p><p>found wanting.  Most Istanbul analysts remain decidedly </p><p>downbeat on the government economic team, expressing grudging </p><p>respect only for Finance Minister Unakitan.  Only by reaching </p><p>outside the government for a "Dervis," in Gulkan and Ozturk\'s </p><p>view, can the government regain credibility.  They (and we) </p><p>see this as an extremely remote possibility, however.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
