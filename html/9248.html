(C) SUMMARY:  On June 26 Ambassador and DCM met with </p><p>Honduran Attorney General (AG), Roy Medina, to discuss </p><p>corruption in the Public Ministry (PM) and the lack of any </p><p>serious effort to prosecute high-level criminal cases by the </p><p>Attorney General\'s office.  This meeting came a day after </p><p>Ambassador\'s meeting with President Maduro where similar </p><p>issues were discussed (ref C).  AG Medina acknowledged </p><p>shortcomings in the PM; however, he also indicated that </p><p>faulty police work and ineffective judges were hampering his </p><p>efforts to bring cases to trial.  Ambassador told Medina that </p><p>the USG expected significant progress soon and that if it was </p><p>not forthcoming, Post would reconsider the support it </p><p>provides the PM, with a view toward suspending all USG aid to </p><p>his office.  Narcotrafficking, money laundering, and other </p><p>corruption issues were also discussed.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) On June 26 Ambassador and DCM meet with Honduran </p><p>Attorney General (AG), Roy Medina to discuss corruption in </p><p>the Public Ministry (PM) and the lack of any serious effort </p><p>to prosecute high-level criminal cases by the Attorney </p><p>General\'s office.  Ambassador specifically cited inaction on </p><p>cases involving narcotraffickers, money launders, and other </p><p>high profile individuals.  Ambassador noted that the PM had </p><p>no difficulty prosecuting low-level criminal cases, but that </p><p>in the Ambassador\'s nine months at Post, not one high-level </p><p>case has been prosecuted.  Given the USG\'s disappointment, </p><p>inaction at the PM, and the inertia that seems to have </p><p>developed regarding high-profile cases, Ambassador put Medina </p><p>on notice that the PM has until August 1 to demonstrate its </p><p>commitment and deliver results, or Post would reconsider the </p><p>support it provides the PM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  As an example of the PM\'s unwillingness to move </p><p>forward against high-profile individuals, Ambassador </p><p>mentioned the case of Jose Israel Pineda Duarte (aka Paico), </p><p>a well-known major narcotrafficker operating on the North </p><p>Coast of Honduras (ref A).  Ambassador also made reference to </p><p>an anonymous document delivered to the PM which contains </p><p>allegations of illicit activity and corrupt officials (Post </p><p>also has copy).  Medina queried Ambassador whether Post had </p><p>done any investigations into the allegations.  Ambassador </p><p>unequivocally stated that it was the job of the PM to </p><p>investigate its own cases. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Public Ministry Inaction on Existing Cases </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DCM noted that not one of the 160 money laundering </p><p>cases before the PM had been acted upon.  Medina, in </p><p>disbelief, asked an assistant to confirm the number. </p><p>According to the PM there were 136 cases.  Medina expressed </p><p>shock, chagrin, and embarrassment at the number of cases and </p><p>indicated that the PM would begin to move forward on them. </p><p>When asked by Ambassador about inaction on high-profile drug </p><p>related cases, Medina had no response. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Medina offered to shake-up the organized crime unit in </p><p>an effort to invigorate the PM, but professed that the PM </p><p>lacked sufficient resources to effectively prosecute </p><p>high-level cases.  Medina also claimed that faulty police </p><p>work, and judges that summarily dismiss cases, were also to </p><p>blame. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Corruption in the Public Ministry </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Ambassador expressed USG concerns over allegations of </p><p>high-level corruption at the PM.  Medina indicated that if he </p><p>became aware of any wrong-doing that we would dismiss the </p><p>individual and assure that he/she went to jail.  Ambassador </p><p>again reiterated that it was the job of the PM to investigate </p><p>cases and that the PM had until August 1 to begin to deliver </p><p>results. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Medina noted the limited time-frame the PM had to act, </p><p>but said he was committed to moving forward on high-level </p><p>cases and that his individual honor was on the line.  Medina </p><p>vowed to get to the bottom of inaction at the PM and claimed </p><p>that he would personally work to strengthen the institution. </p><p>8. (C) When questioned by Ambassador as to why seized funds </p><p>were not in accounts at the Central Bank, Medina claimed that </p><p>under Honduran law, all funds must be placed in interest </p><p>bearing accounts in the individuals name until the cases are </p><p>resolved.  Medina assured Ambassador that the accounts were </p><p>frozen and tamper proof. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Action (or Inaction) at the DLCN </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Medina mentioned the recent shake-up at the Direction </p><p>in the Fight Against Narcotrafficking (DLCN) and indicated he </p><p>was considering offering Gustavo Alfredo ((Landaverde)) </p><p>Hernandez the deputy position there (ref B).  He opined that </p><p>Landaverde, as an outspoken critic of the GOH\'s counter-drug </p><p>efforts, might be interested in working with the DLCN to </p><p>improve the overall effectiveness of the institution. </p><p>(Comment:  Post understands that Landaverde is considering </p><p>accepting an advisory position at the PM after the AG asked </p><p>him to help mend relations with the USG.  End Comment) </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Medina indicated that he intended to augment the </p><p>DLCN\'s force by adding another 30 officers to the current </p><p>force of 27. Overall, the DLCN is authorized to employ 100 </p><p>agents. (Comment:  This effort is viewed by many to be too </p><p>little, too late.  The DLCN has never been an effective tool </p><p>for combating narcotrafficking.  Perpetually underfunded and </p><p>undermanned, the DLCN has seen its scarce resources limited </p><p>by the AG.  Simply adding another 30 officers to the payroll </p><p>will do little to increase the unit\'s effectiveness.  End </p><p>Comment)  Medina also told the new DLCN head that while the </p><p>fight against corruption and drug traffickers was important, </p><p>a priority at the PM was increasing its forensic medicine </p><p>abilities. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>A Time for Talk, a Time for Action </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) Comment:  Complaints against the ineffectiveness of </p><p>AG Medina are not new.  Either through incompetence (but </p><p>probably due to corruption) the PM under Medina\'s leadership </p><p>has consistently disappointed those looking for improvements </p><p>in the GOH\'s ability to effectively fight high-profile </p><p>criminals.  It remains to be seen whether Post\'s threat to </p><p>withdraw support from the PM will have the desired effect, </p><p>but if history is any precedent, Post is not optimistic. </p><p>Post expects Medina to continue to obfuscate the issues and </p><p>pass the blame, rather than face the heat of prosecuting </p><p>high-level criminal cases.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
