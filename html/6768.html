(S/NF)  The Ambassador convened an Emergency Action </p><p>Committee (EAC) March 23 to discuss current threat </p><p>information, security measures and Embassy security posture. </p><p>No new threats were reported.  EAC decided to move from </p><p>MoveSafe to StandFast effective 3/27 at the close of business </p><p>in anticipation of possible demonstrations on Friday after </p><p>mosque sermons.

Ambassador welcomed the </p><p>idea.  RSO, PSO and MOI met on March 25 to discuss </p><p>implementation details and these will continue to be </p><p>discussed.

A town hall meeting will be held </p><p>on March 26 for all official Americans to discuss authorized </p><p>departure and to solicit views directly from staff.  Post </p><p>will also hold a warden meeting next week. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
