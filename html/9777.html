<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004737 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS: CONTROVERSY, </p><p>INDIFFERENCE, ISOLATED VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 4251 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 4189 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman, per Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  Jordan\'s municipal elections concluded </p><p>July 27 with little fanfare but some controversy.  Despite </p><p>the efforts of the Islamic Action Front (IAF) to seek delay, </p><p>more than 80 percent of municipal councils held contested </p><p>elections over the weekend.  The IAF remained firm in its </p><p>insistence that the voting was marred by instances of voter </p><p>fraud and procedural irregularity, which the government </p><p>characterized as an example of the IAF\'s predictable </p><p>anti-government line.  In two instances, election-related </p><p>violence disrupted what were generally orderly and peaceful </p><p>days of voting.  A mediocre turn-out reflected public apathy </p><p>for the new structure of the municipal councils system, which </p><p>marries elected officials with technocratic appointees.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Procedure, Process & Results </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Prior to the polls, the IAF initiated a petition to </p><p>postpone the elections so newly elected MPs could review the </p><p>temporary Municipal Elections Law that authorizes the Cabinet </p><p>to appoint up to 50 percent of municipal council members and </p><p>all mayors (ref A).  Despite this protest, the IAF </p><p>participated in Amman municipality elections and boycotted </p><p>the rest of the country.  In Amman, four of its 11 candidates </p><p>won seats (ref B).  In 1999, the party secured five seats on </p><p>the capital\'s city council. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Voter turn-out approached 58 percent in the 82 </p><p>cities and town that held polls, officials announced July 28. </p><p> Voter turn-out in tribal and rural areas was higher than in </p><p>major cities.  Analysts say the elections were characterized </p><p>by the absence of political rivalry and the domination of </p><p>tribalism in most districts.  In a July 28 press conference, </p><p>Minister of Municipal Affairs Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat announced </p><p>that the highest turn-out of 81 percent was registered in </p><p>Jerash Governorate, while the lowest participation was 28 </p><p>percent in Zarqa. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  1,608 candidates competed for 402 seats in 82 </p><p>municipal councils.  Among the 46 women running in the 99 </p><p>municipalities\' elections, five won seats.  152 candidates in </p><p>17 districts won seats in uncontested elections.  The </p><p>approximately half of the remaining council members and all </p><p>mayors will be appointed by the government and announced </p><p>shortly.  Officials will appoint a woman to each municipality </p><p>in which women failed to win seats. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  In Greater Amman, voting was extended for a second </p><p>day in 13 out of the capital\'s 20 districts due to low </p><p>turn-out.  96 candidates competed for 20 council seats, </p><p>including a woman who withdrew.  Around 46 percent of the </p><p>capital\'s 306,418 voters participated.  This turn-out trumped </p><p>those of the previous two municipal elections in 1999 and </p><p>1995, when 41 percent and 35 percent of eligible voters case </p><p>their ballots, respectively. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Voice of Opposition </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The IAF called July 28 for the government to scrap </p><p>the results of the elections in Greater Amman, alleging that </p><p>the electoral process had been tarnished by violations </p><p>ranging from vote rigging to interference by security forces </p><p>at polls to government efforts to change the composition of </p><p>certain balloting committees prior to the elections.  The </p><p>opposition claimed that eligible voters with stamped family </p><p>books could not locate their names in the voting rosters at </p><p>polling stations.  IAF Secretary-General Hamzeh Mansour told </p><p>one paper a day earlier that "many voters voted more than </p><p>once.  Some voters went to the ballot box five times." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Regarding his party\'s decision to participate in </p><p>Amman despite calls for review of the Municipal Election Law, </p><p>Mansour stated, "we participated with 11 candidates because </p><p>(Greater Amman\'s election law) -- since its endorsement -- </p><p>stipulates appointing 50 percent of the council members in </p><p>addition to the mayor.  But applying this same system to the </p><p>other municipalities was newly introduced and has not been </p><p>endorsed by Parliament."  A sign of the IAF\'s displeasure </p><p>with the electoral system, Mansour remarked July 28 that </p><p>"citizens used to elect their candidates at a time when </p><p>Jordan was under the British mandate...  Now we are living in </p><p>the third millennium, and the government still thinks that </p><p>people are not qualified or equipped enough to elect all </p><p>municipal council members."  Mansour was quoted in the July </p><p>29 issue of the Jordanian daily, al-Arab al-Yawm, saying the </p><p>IAF will provide documents proving the government rigged the </p><p>Amman elections. </p><p>8.  (U)  GOJ officials insisted the electoral process was </p><p>fair and transparent and invited all person with complaints </p><p>to the employ the Jordanian judicial system for resolution. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Petra News Agency reported July 27 that some </p><p>citizens complained of not having their names correctly </p><p>indicated on voters\' lists.  Others said their correct </p><p>national numbers were not on the list, making them ineligible </p><p>to vote.  The government, for its part, accused the IAF of </p><p>playing its usual game of attacking and undermining official </p><p>policy, without hard evidence or thorough investigation. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Isolated Violence </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  As in the June parliamentary elections, the </p><p>municipal elections passed with minimal violence.  The most </p><p>serious case involved two injuries in a dispute between </p><p>supporters of two rival candidates in the Southern Shouneh </p><p>disrict of the Jordan Valley on July 26.  Violence flared as </p><p>supporters of the leading candidate started "teasing </p><p>supporters of those who lost," according to Balqa Governor </p><p>Thamer Fayez on July 27.  Those accused of opening fire were </p><p>in police custody for questioning, said Fayez in a press </p><p>interview, while those wounded were in stable condition. </p><p>Authorities deployed at the scene of the skirmish, while </p><p>local deputies started tribal mediation  efforts to reach a </p><p>reconciliation between the two sides.  On the same day, a car </p><p>was reported damaged in the Jordan Valley community of Deir </p><p>Allah -- an act also attributed to electoral disputes. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Public Opinion </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  The Jordan Times informally gauged public opinion </p><p>in its July 28 issue, finding that regardless of personal </p><p>attitudes toward the new hybrid electoral system, obtaining </p><p>governmental services remains more important than issues of </p><p>political structure for ordinary citizens.  Some opponents of </p><p>the mixed council system fear that appointees will come from </p><p>other areas, making them less qualified than elected members </p><p>that know their constituency and can relate to citizens and </p><p>their needs.  Proponents, however, believe that communities </p><p>do not need local notable citizens but educated people with </p><p>sufficient expertise to ensure the best performance. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Deputy Mayor of Amman Abdul Rahim Biqai told the </p><p>press on July 28 that complaints of far-from-efficient public </p><p>sector performance were "understandable" but linked the slow </p><p>pace of development with a fast-increasing population growth </p><p>rate in the capital.  Both Tbeishat and Biqai expect </p><p>municipal work to gain momentum after the elections, with </p><p>Biqai promising a "package of services" to Greater Amman </p><p>residents. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  While there are doubts about the new, hybrid </p><p>municipal councils structure, the population is more </p><p>interested in the delivery of services than in who delivers </p><p>them.  The IAF\'s opposition to the structure is perhaps less </p><p>a function of the group\'s displeasure with the </p><p>de-democratization of the country than it is a comment on its </p><p>lack of broad-based, grass-roots support outside Amman. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  While there were probably procedural violations </p><p>during two days of polling, like the parliamentary elections, </p><p>we do not believe they were widespread enough to change the </p><p>election results.  As with the parliamentary elections, it </p><p>was the legal basis of the municipal elections that steered </p><p>the results toward the government, not the procedures </p><p>themselves. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  Voter apathy, reflected in the 58 percent voter </p><p>turn-out rate, and the much lower rates in major urban </p><p>centers, derives in part from opposition to the hybrid </p><p>council structure, weariness after the recent parliamentary </p><p>elections, and a general feeling among Jordanians that, </p><p>elected or appointed, council members will serve their own </p><p>interests before those of their constituents.  End Comment. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
