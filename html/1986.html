THE </p><p>    U. S.

THE OKLAHOMA BOMBING IN </p><p>    1995 WAS INITIALLY BLAMED ON ARAB TERRORISTS, </p><p>    UNTIL IT TRANSPIRED THAT THIS WAS A </p><p>    HOME-GROWN ATROCITY. . .

BUT GEORGE W.

FOR THE WORLD, THE LATEST </p><p>    DISPLAY OF HUMANKIND\'S OWN INHUMANITY TO HUMANKIND </p><p>    MUST REMIND PEOPLE THAT TERROR AND VIOLENCE MAY </p><p>    HAVE ONLY </p><p>    SHORT-TERM ADVANTAGES, BUT IN THE END THEY WILL </p><p>    NOT SOLVE CONFLICTS.  THE UNITED STATES WILL </p><p>    SURVIVE TUESDAY\'S HORROR. . .  THE PEOPLE WHO SENT </p><p>    THE SUICIDE PILOTS HURTLING INTO THE TWIN TOWERS </p><p>    OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE PENTAGON MOST </p><p>    CERTAINLY DESERVE SEVERE PUNISHMENT, AS DO THE </p><p>    COUNTRIES WHICH AIDED AND ABETTED THEM.

IT HAS </p><p>    BEEN DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND HOW SUCH A SMALL </p><p>    GROUP - AND THE U. S.

INSTEAD IT HAD CONCENTRATED A MAJOR </p><p>    DIPLOMATIC EFFORT ON CREATING A VAST COALITION FOR </p><p>    A MAJOR WAR ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM THAT WILL </p><p>    INVOLVE THE POLICE, INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY </p><p>    AGENCIES IN MANY COUNTRIES.
