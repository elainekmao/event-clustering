CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE DEBATE OVER INCLUSION OF SHARIA LAW </p><p>PROVISIONS IN THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION REMAINS THE MOST </p><p>DIVISIVE ISSUE IN THE RUN-UP TOWARD LIFTING THE BAN ON </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  THE ARMED FORCES RULING COUNCIL </p><p>(AFRC) ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 29 THAT PROVISIONS ON SHARIA </p><p>LAW MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE CONSTITUTION BEFORE THE AFRC </p><p>WOULD ACCEPT IT FOR REVIEW (REF B).  THE SURPRISE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT REOPENED THE DEBATE IN THE CONSTITUENT </p><p>ASSEMBLY AFTER THE AFRC HAD PUT A STOP TO THE POLITICAL </p><p>WRANGLING OVER THE ISSUE IN NOVEMBER 1988 (REF A). </p><p>HOWEVER, THE AFRC ANNOUNCED THAT THE CONSTITUENT </p><p>ASSEMBLY MUST STILL SUBMIT THE COMPLETED DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION ON TIME--TODAY, APRIL 5--BUT THE PRESS IS </p><p>CONSPICUOUSLY SILENT ON THE ISSUE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT LANGUAGE ON SHARIA LAW MUST BE </p><p>INCLUDED IN THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION HAS CAUSED WIDESPREAD </p><p>CONFUSION IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>PRESS REPORTS, CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY </p><p>JUSTICE ANTHONY ANIAGOLU HAD UPHELD THE ASSEMBLY\'S </p><p>MAJORITY RULING ON APRIL 1 THAT THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION </p><p>BE SUBMITTED TO THE AFRC IN TWO SEPARATE PARTS:  ONE </p><p>INCLUDING THE AGREED-ON CLAUSES, AND A SECOND SETTING </p><p>FORTH THE "UNDEBATED CLAUSES," INCLUDING SHARIA.  AFTER </p><p>THE APRIL 1 ASSEMBLY SESSION, PRESS REPORTS CONTINUE, </p><p>NORTHERN MEMBERS "LAY AMBUSH" ON CHAIRMAN ANIAGOLU AS HE </p><p>LEFT THE ASSEMBLY TO PROTEST HIS DECISION.  SEVERAL </p><p>MEMBERS FROM THE EAST REPORTEDLY STEPPED IN TO PROTECT </p><p>THE CHAIRMAN, ENDING THE INCIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN A PRIVATE MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR LYMAN ON APRIL </p><p>4, SECRETARY TO THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT (FMG) </p><p>CHIEF OLU FALAE (PROTECT - REF D) COMPLAINED THAT CHIEF </p><p>OF GENERAL STAFF VICE ADMIRAL AIKHOMU HAD MISMANAGED THE </p><p>ISSUE; AIKHOMU\'S DECISION TO INSTRUCT THE CONSTITUENT </p><p>ASSEMBLY TO REINSTATE THE SHARIA CLAUSES IN THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN MADE IN FALAE\'S ABSENCE.  FALAE </p><p>STATED THAT AIKHOMU LACKS POLITICAL SENSITIVITY TOWARD </p><p>THE ISSUE AND MISUNDERSTOOD THE IMPLICATIONS OF </p><p>RE-INTRODUCING THE DEBATE IN THE CONSTITUENT </p><p>ASSEMBLY--THE SHARPENING OF RELIGIOUS RIVALRY BETWEEN </p><p>MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  THE AFRC\'S MARCH 29 ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE </p><p>SHARIA CLAUSES MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN INTERPRETED BY SOME OF OUR </p><p>CONTACTS AND IN PARTS OF THE PRESS AS A DELIBERATE </p><p>ATTEMPT TO STALL SUBMISSION OF THE DOCUMENT AND THUS </p><p>POSTPONE LIFTING THE BAN ON POLITICAL ACTIVITY. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE AFRC\'S INSISTENCE THAT THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION BE SUBMITTED ON TIME DESPITE THE </p><p>REINTRODUCTION OF THE CONTENTIOUS SHARIA ISSUE LENDS </p><p>CREDENCE TO FALAE\'S ALLEGATIONS OF FMG MISMANAGEMENT OF </p><p>THE ISSUE.  THE FACT THAT THE NORMALLY VOCAL PRESS WAS </p><p>TOTALLY SILENT ON THE ISSUE TODAY--UNWILLING TO EVEN </p><p>SPECULATE ABOUT THE OUTCOME--AND THAT BABANGIDA IS </p><p>REPORTEDLY IN ABUJA, DEMONSTRATES THAT THE FINAL </p><p>DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT THE SHARIA CLAUSES WILL BE IN </p><p>THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION IS STILL UP FOR GRABS OR THAT A </p><p>COMPROMISE COULD BE WORKED OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LYMAN </p><p></p></div>
