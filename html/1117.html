<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001700 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/WCI - SCHEFFER/WARRICK, S/SA - O\'BRIEN, </p><p>S/CT - SHEEHAN/BAIR, DRL - KOH/SPENCER, L - </p><p>ANDREWS/MATHESON, L/EUR - LAHNE, INR/WCAD - DONAHUE/MORIN, </p><p>EUR/SCE - COUNTRYMAN/DANIELS; </p><p>SARAJEVO FOR AMBASSADOR MILLER/GAUDIOSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 FIVE YEARS AFTER CLOSURE ICTY </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BK, HR, SR, NL, ICTY </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY: READ-OUT ON RS PRIME MINISTER DODIK\'S </p><p>MEETING WITH DEL PONTE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY:  ALLEN S. WEINER, LEGAL COUNSELOR. </p><p>REASONS: 1.5(B), (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  REPUBLIKA SRPSKA (RS) PRIME MINISTER </p><p>DODIK\'S MAY 29 WITH THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY) WAS USEFUL </p><p>FROM A SYMBOLIC POINT OF VIEW INSOFAR AS IT DEMONSTRATED </p><p>"GOODWILL" ON THE PART OF THE RS.  IN THE ICTY\'S VIEW, </p><p>HOWEVER, NOTHING OF GREAT SUBSTANCE EMERGED FROM THE MEETING. </p><p> DODIK HAS PLEDGED IMPROVED COOPERATION IN CERTAIN AREAS, </p><p>INCLUDING ACCOMMODATING CONCERNS OF THE ICTY\'S OFFICE OF THE </p><p>PROSECUTOR (OTP) ON THE DRAFT LAW ON RS COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>ICTY.  DODIK AND DEL PONTE ALSO DISCUSSED APPREHENSION ISSUES </p><p>AND THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONAL RELEASE OF BOSNIAN SERB </p><p>INDICTEES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ON JUNE 7, ICTY DEPUTY PROSECUTOR GRAHAM BLEWITT </p><p>PROVIDED EMBASSY LEGAL COUNSELOR WITH A READ-OUT OF RS PRIME </p><p>MINISTER DODIK\'S MAY 29 MEETING WITH ICTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR </p><p>CARLA DEL PONTE.  ACCORDING TO BLEWITT, THE MEETING, WHICH </p><p>WAS HASTILY ARRANGED, WAS BRIEF AND WAS "IN THE NATURE OF A </p><p>COURTESY CALL."  THAT SAID, HE THOUGHT THE VISIT WAS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT IN THAT IT DEMONSTRATED GOODWILL ON THE PART OF </p><p>THE RS, AND A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC AREAS OF COOPERATION WERE </p><p>DISCUSSED.  BLEWITT NOTED THAT FORMER RS MINISTER OF JUSTICE </p><p>TRBOJEVIC, WHO WAS FIRED SHORTLY AFTER HIS VISIT TO THE ICTY </p><p>EARLIER THIS YEAR, ACCOMPANIED DODIK.  ALTHOUGH TRBOJEVIC NO </p><p>LONGER HAS A FORMAL POSITION IN THE RS GOVERNMENT, DODIK </p><p>INDICATED THAT TRBOJEVIC REMAINS ONE OF HIS CLOSE ADVISORS </p><p>AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON RS-ICTY COOPERATION ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  DURING THE MEETING, DEL PONTE REPORTED THAT THE </p><p>ICTY\'S BANJA LUKA FIELD OFFICE WAS NOW OPEN, AND THAT THE </p><p>OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR (OTP) WAS SATISFIED WITH THE LEVEL </p><p>OF COOPERATION IT WAS RECEIVING FROM THE RS AT THE "LIAISON </p><p>LEVEL." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ON THE ISSUE OF PROVISIONAL RELEASE OF BOSNIAN SERB </p><p>INDICTEES, DEL PONTE EXPRESSED HER OPPOSITION TO, AND </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT WITH, THE TRIAL CHAMBER\'S DECISION TO GRANT </p><p>PROVISIONAL RELEASE TO MIROSLAV TADIC AND SIMO ZARIC, TWO OF </p><p>THE INDICTEES IN THE BOSANSKI SAMAC CASE.  (NOTE:  A THIRD </p><p>INDICTEE, MILAN SIMIC, HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN GRANTED </p><p>PROVISIONAL RELEASE.)  SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>OPPOSE PROVISIONAL RELEASE TO THE RS AS LONG AS ICTY </p><p>INDICTEES REMAINED AT LARGE THERE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  BLEWITT SAID DEL PONTE EXPRESSED DISPLEASURE WITH </p><p>THE RS\'S FAILURE TO APPREHEND TWO INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY A </p><p>SEALED INDICTMENT.  BY WAY OF BACKGROUND, BLEWITT EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT ALTHOUGH THE INDICTMENT IN QUESTION REMAINS UNDER SEAL, </p><p>THE OTP HAD REASON TO BELIEVE IT HAD BEEN COMPROMISED. </p><p>ACCORDINGLY, OTP HAD SERVED THE INDICTMENT AND ARREST </p><p>WARRANTS ON THE RS AS A TEST CASE OF THE RS\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>IMPROVE COOPERATION IN THIS AREA.  DODIK REPORTED THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S INFORMATION IS THAT THE TWO INDIVIDUALS IN </p><p>QUESTION HAVE FLED TO SERBIA.  HE SAID THE RS HAD APPROACHED </p><p>THE SERBIAN MUP FOR HELP IN SECURING CUSTODY OF THE TWO, BUT </p><p>HAD RECEIVED NO RESPONSE.  DEL PONTE SAID SHE WOULD PUBLICLY </p><p>DISCLOSE THE INDICTMENT IF THERE IS NO PROGRESS ON </p><p>APPREHENDING THE INDICTEES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  WITH RESPECT TO RADOVAN KARADZIC, DODIK SAID HE </p><p>WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE INFORMATION ON KARADZIC\'S </p><p>WHEREABOUTS, BUT SAID THAT THE RS INTELLIGENCE SERVICES "WERE </p><p>EFFECTIVE ONLY TO A POINT" ON THIS SCORE.  HE URGED DEL PONTE </p><p>TO CONTINUE PRESSING SFOR TO ARREST KARADZIC.  HE OBSERVED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT IF KARADZIC WERE ARRESTED JUST BEFORE UPCOMING </p><p>ELECTIONS, IT COULD "AFFECT HIS ABILITY TO REMAIN IN POWER." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE OTP ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO RS </p><p>WITNESSES.  THE OTP, ACTING PURSUANT TO ITS AUTHORITY TO </p><p>SUMMON WITNESSES UNDER RULE 39 OF ITS RULES OF PROCEDURE AND </p><p>EVIDENCE, HAS OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS BEEN INTERVIEWING </p><p>REPUBLIKA SRPSKA ARMY (VRS) OFFICERS IN BANJA LUKA IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH THE KRSTIC TRIAL.  RS COOPERATION HAS </p><p>GENERALLY BEEN GOOD, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF "NO </p><p>SHOWS" RECENTLY.  DODIK PROMISED FULL COOPERATION AND SAID HE </p><p>WOULD USE HIS "INFLUENCE" TO ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THAT ALL </p><p>SUMMONED VRS OFFICERS MET WITH OTP INVESTIGATORS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ON THE DRAFT RS LAW ON COOPERATION WITH ICTY, THE </p><p>OTP NOTED THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE INITIAL </p><p>DRAFT OF THE LAW PROVIDED TO THEM, AND HAD PROVIDED THE RS </p><p>WITH COMMENTS.  DODIK REPORTED THAT THE LAW HAS BEEN REVISED </p><p>TO INCORPORATE THE OTP\'S COMMENTS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE LAW </p><p>WILL BE INTRODUCED AT THE NEXT SESSION OF THE RS PARLIAMENT. </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO LEGAL COUNSELOR\'S QUESTION, BLEWITT SAID THAT </p><p>THE OTP HAS NOT YET SEEN THE REVISED LAW.  (COMMENT:  IT </p><p>WOULD BE HELPFUL IF EMBASSY SARAJEVO COULD OBTAIN A COPY OF </p><p>THE CURRENT DRAFT OF THE LAW FOR US TO SHARE WITH THE OTP TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT OTP CONCERNS HAVE BEEN SATISFACTORILY ADDRESSED.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S)  DODIK ALSO SAID THAT IT WOULD HELP OVERCOME THE </p><p>WIDESPREAD VIEW IN THE RS THAT THE ICTY IS BIASED AGAINST THE </p><p>SERBS IF THE OTP ISSUED INDICTMENTS AGAINST NON-SERBS IN </p><p>BOSNIA.  DEL PONTE SAID ONLY THAT THE OTP WAS WORKING HARD IN </p><p>THIS REGARD. </p><p>FENDRICK </p><p></p></div>
