<p>S E C R E T BAGHDAD 02144 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, IZ </p><p>SUBJ:  IRAQI OPERATION TO RECAPTURE FAO:"WE SHOWED </p><p>THE SOVIETS" </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR MAY 19, MFA </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DIRECTOR QAYSI DISCUSSED </p><p>THE BRIEFING ON FAO GIVEN BY FONMIN AZIZ TO HIS </p><p>SENIOR STAFF THAT MORNING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AZIZ TOLD HIS PEOPLE THAT THE DECISION TO </p><p>RETAKE FAO WAS MADE LAST FALL UNDER ELABORATE </p><p>SECRECY WHEN THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP CONCLUDED THAT </p><p>THE 598 PROCESS WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE UNLESS IRAQ </p><p>GAVE IT A PUSH BY GAINING SOME MILITARY VICTORY. </p><p>(THE DECISION TO PRESS AHEAD WITH STOCKPILING </p><p>"HUSSEIN" MISSILES FOR MASSIVE USE WAS PROBABLY </p><p>RELATED.).  IRAQ THEN ENGAGED IN A CAREFUL DECEPTION </p><p>OPERATION, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CREATED A FULL- </p><p>SCALE MODEL OF THE FAO SALT PANS FOR DETAILED </p><p>PRACTICE OPERATIONS BY ITS UNITS.  WHEN THE TIME </p><p>FOR THE OPERATION WAS NEAR, SADDAM, MINDEF </p><p>KHAIRALLAH AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF MADE A WELL- </p><p>PUBLISIZED VISITTO THE NORTH, BUT THEN SECRETLY </p><p>JETTED IMMEDIATELY TO BASRA.  PREVIOUSLY SOME </p><p>UNNEEDED ARMY UNITS IN THE SOUTH (WE RECALL REPORT- </p><p>ING ON A FULL DIVISION) WERE MOVED NORTH IN DAYLIGHT </p><p>TO DECEIVE THE IRANIANS FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IRAQI TROOPS JUMPED OFF AT 0625 MAY 17 ACCORDING </p><p>TO AZIZ, AFTER DAWN WHEN IRANIAN UNITS WOULD HAVE </p><p>BEGUN TO RELAX.  (AN ORDER TO LAUNCH THE ATTACK AT </p><p>2200 THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WAS PART OF THE DECEPTION). </p><p>IRAQI UNITS ACHIEVED COMPLETE SURPRISE AND PENE- </p><p>TRATED THE ENTIRE IRANIAN DEFENSES IN THE SALT PANS </p><p>IN A GUDERIAN-STYLE OPERATION, LEAVING IT TO </p><p>FOLLOWING UNITS TO MOP UP RESISTANCE WHILE THE TWO </p><p>PINCERS OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD AND THE SEVENTH </p><p>CORPS JOINED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OBSTACLE. </p><p>IRAQI UNITS THEN ENTERED FAO THE MORNING OF MAY 18. </p><p>AZIZ SAID THAT IRAQI CASUALTIES HAD BEEN MORE THAN </p><p>REASONABLE FOR SUCH AN OPERATION AND CONSIDERABLY </p><p>LESS THAN PLANNERS HAD ANTICIPATED.  AZIZ DID NOT </p><p>GIVE  ANY IRANIAN CASUALTY FIGURES OR COMMENT HOW </p><p>MANY MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  QAYSI SAID THAT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE </p><p>ELATED BY THE NEWS WHICH HE AGREED WAS IRAQ\'S </p><p>GREATEST MILITARY SUCCESS SINCE 1980-81.  HE RECALLED </p><p>A MEETING HE ATTENDED OF AZIZ WITH SHEVARDNADZE IN </p><p>THE SUMMER OF 1986 IN MOSCOW AFTER THE FAO DEBACLE </p><p>WHEN  THE SOVIET, TREATING AZIZ HUMILIATINGLY LIKE </p><p>THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A DEFEATED NATION, URGED HIM </p><p>TO AGREE TO HALT THE WAR ON THE BASIS OF A </p><p>CEASEFIRE IN PLACE.  AZIZ TOLD SHEVARDNADZE THAT </p><p>IRAQ WOULD NEVER SETTLE FOR LESS THAN A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>PEACE WITH FULL WITHDRAWAL AND AN EXCHANGE OF </p><p>PRISONERS, BUT THE SOVIET FONMIN OBVIOUSLY DISMISSED </p><p>THIS POSITION AS PURE PROPAGANDA.  NOW IRAQ WAS </p><p>VINDICATED, QAYSI SAID WITH PRIDE, AND HAD SHOWN </p><p>THAT IT ALWAYS MEANT WHAT IT SAID. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN A FINAL PURELY PERSONAL COMMENT, QAYSI </p><p>GUESSED THAT IRAQ, FLUSHED WITH SUCCESS, MIGHT NOT BE </p><p>FINISHED HITTING THE IRANIANS.  HE WOULD NOT BE </p><p>SURPRISED, HE SAID, TO SEE A SIMILAR OPERATION IN </p><p>THE FUTURE EAST OF BASRA.  THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED </p><p>THAT SUCH AN OPERATION STRAIGHT TOWARDS IRAN COULD </p><p>BE EVEN TOUGHER THAN FAO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p></p></div>
