<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 MADRID 004435 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, SP </p><p>SUBJECT: SPAIN: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN MAINTAINED ITS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. IN THE WAR </p><p>ON TERROR THROUGHOUT 2002 AND IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY </p><p>ADVOCATES WITHIN THE EU FOR ENHANCING MECHANISMS TO FIGHT </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING IS THE 2002 TERRORISM REPORT SUBMISSION FOR </p><p>SPAIN. </p><p> </p><p>A. GOS SUPPORT FOR GLOBAL ANTI/TERRORISM COALITION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>1. ACTIONS AGAINST AL QAEDA OPERATIVES </p><p> </p><p>BUILDING ON ARRESTS MADE IN 2001, SPANISH LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>MADE ADDITIONAL ARRESTS OF AL QAEDA ASSOCIATES DURING 2002. </p><p>IN JANUARY, POLICE ARRESTED MOROCCAN CITIZEN NAJIB CHAIB </p><p>MOHAMED IN A BARCELONA SUBURB.  CHAIB MOHAMED WAS ACCUSED OF </p><p>BELONGING TO A TERRORIST CELL HEADED BY IMAD EDDIN BARAKAT </p><p>YARKAS, ALSO KNOWN AS ABU DAHDAH, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN SPAIN </p><p>IN NOVEMBER 2001.  SPANISH POLICE BELIEVE DAHDAH/YARKAS WAS </p><p>AL QAEDA\'S LEADING OPERATIVE AND RECRUITER IN SPAIN.  HE </p><p>REMAINS IN CUSTODY.  CHAIB MOHAMED WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH </p><p>FALSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS AND CREDIT CARD FRAUD. </p><p> </p><p>ON APRIL 13, THE SPANISH CIVIL GUARD ARRESTED AHMED BRAHIM, </p><p>AN ALGERIAN NATIONAL WITH SPANISH RESIDENCY, AND CHARGED HIM </p><p>WITH "COLLABORATION WITH AN ARMED GROUP."  FOUR OTHER </p><p>INDIVIDUALS HOLDING FRENCH PASSPORTS WERE WITH BRAHIM AT THE </p><p>TIME AND WERE DETAINED BUT LATER RELEASED.  THE ARREST WAS </p><p>PRECIPITATED BY THE SALE OF PROPERTY AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT </p><p>APPEARED TO BE PREPARATIONS ON THE PART OF BRAHIM TO LEAVE </p><p>SPAIN.  THE SPANISH CIVIL GUARD ACCUSED BRAHIM OF FINANCING </p><p>SOME TERRORIST "SLEEPER" CELLS, OF ORGANIZING AL QAEDA\'S </p><p>INVESTMENTS IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND OF SHELTERING </p><p>ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.  BRAHIM REMAINS IN CUSTODY. </p><p> </p><p>ON APRIL 23, POLICE ARRESTED MOHAMMED GALEB KALAJE ZOUAYDI, </p><p>ALIAS ABU THALHA, A NATURALIZED SPANISH CITIZEN OF SYRIAN </p><p>DESCENT.  ZOUAYDI HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ARRESTED IN NOVEMBER </p><p>2001, ALONG WITH ABU DAHDAH (YARKAS), AND HAD BEEN SET FREE </p><p>SHORTLY THEREAFTER FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE.  AN ANALYSIS OF </p><p>DOCUMENTS SEIZED PURSUANT TO SEARCH WARRANTS EXECUTED AT </p><p>BOTH HIS RESIDENCE AND AT HIS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY DURING </p><p>THE 2001 ARREST PROMPTED HIS RE-ARREST AND SUPPORTED THE </p><p>CHARGE THAT ZOUAYDI IS A PRINCIPAL FINANCIER FOR THE AL </p><p>QAEDA NETWORK. </p><p> </p><p>ON JULY 7, 2002, THE SPANISH NATIONAL POLICE ARRESTED FOUR </p><p>SYRIAN-BORN MALES (SPANISH RESIDENTS) WITH TIES TO THE AL </p><p>QAEDA ORGANIZATION.  THIS OPERATION WAS DIRECTED BY SPANISH </p><p>NATIONAL COURT JUDGE BALTASAR GARZON AND WAS A CONTINUATION </p><p>OF THE OPERATION ("OPERATION DATIL") TO DISMANTLE THE AL </p><p>QAEDA TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN SPAIN.  ONE OF THE </p><p>DETAINEES, GHASOUB AL-ABRASH, BELONGED TO A RADICAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  AL-ABRASH </p><p>(GHASOUB) HAD BEEN DETAINED EARLIER IN 2002 AS PART OF </p><p>"OPERATION DATIL" BUT HAD BEEN RELEASED.  DURING THIS </p><p>INITIAL ARREST, POLICE SEIZED SEVERAL VIDEOTAPES FROM HIM. </p><p>IT WAS LATER REVEALED THAT DURING A TRIP AL ABRASH (GHASOUB) </p><p>MADE TO THE U.S. IN 1997, HE MADE VIDEO RECORDINGS OF </p><p>INSTALLATIONS, CONSTRUCTION SITES AND US LANDMARKS.  THE </p><p>LANDMARKS INCLUDED THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.  THE STYLE AND </p><p>DURATION OF THE TAPES INDICATED THEY WERE NOT RECORDED FOR </p><p>TOURIST PURPOSES. </p><p> </p><p>IN SEPTEMBER 2002, JUDGE GARZON ORDERED THE RELEASE ON BAIL </p><p>OF THE FOUR SYRIAN-BORN SUSPECTS.  BAIL RANGED FROM $60,000 </p><p>TO $150,000.  GARZON SAID HE HAD TO DO THIS BECAUSE HE </p><p>LACKED EVIDENCE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE HIGH SPANISH LEGAL </p><p>STANDARD FOR HOLDING INDIVIDUALS IN CUSTODY PENDING TRIAL. </p><p>GARZON SAID HE BELIEVED THE SUSPECTS HAD LINKS TO TERRORIST </p><p>CELLS AND PLEDGED THAT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR </p><p>ACTIVITIES WOULD CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p>2. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN HAS SUPPORTED THE RECONSTRUCTION OF AFGHANISTAN WITH </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.  THROUGH THE THIRD </p><p>QUARTER OF 2002, SPAIN HAD PROVIDED OVER USD 60 MILLION IN </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR AGRICULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, HUMANITARIAN, </p><p>TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND OTHER PROGRAMS.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THE SPANISH COUNCIL OF MINISTERS APPROVED IN NOVEMBER A NON- </p><p>REIMBURSABLE CREDIT LINE OF USD 12 MILLION TO AFGHANISTAN </p><p>FOR RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS.   SPAIN HAS PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT </p><p>MATERIAL SUPPORT TO OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (SEE SECTION </p><p>F.) </p><p> </p><p>3. BLOCKING OF TERRORIST ASSETS </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U.S. IN BLOCKING TERRORIST- </p><p>FINANCED ASSETS, AND THE GOS IS SEEKING GREATER AUTHORITY TO </p><p>IMPROVE THAT COOPERATION.  THE GOVERNMENT SENT DRAFT </p><p>LEGISLATION TO THE SPANISH PARLIAMENT IN MARCH 2002 THAT </p><p>WOULD FACILITATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE FREEZING OF BANK </p><p>ACCOUNTS OF TERRORIST GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS.  PASSAGE IS </p><p>EXPECTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003.  SPAIN ALSO CHAIRS </p><p>WITH THE U.S. THE FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE (FATF) WORKING </p><p>GROUP ON TERRORISM FINANCE. </p><p> </p><p>DURING 2002, THE EU INCLUDED THE NAMES OF 28 ETA MEMBERS </p><p>SUBMITTED BY SPAIN TO ITS LISTS OF PERSONS/ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>AGAINST WHOM MEASURES TO COMBAT TERRORISM FINANCING ARE TO </p><p>BE TAKEN.  SPANISH LEADERS HAVE SAID THEY WOULD LIKELY MAKE </p><p>A REQUEST TO INCLUDE THE POLITICAL PARTY BATASUNA AND ITS </p><p>LEADERS (ETA\'S POLITICAL WING) IN SUCH A LIST IF SPANISH </p><p>COURTS DECLARE BATASUNA ILLEGAL.  IN THIS EVENT (WHICH COULD </p><p>HAPPEN IN 2003), SPAIN WOULD ALSO LIKELY APPROACH THE US FOR </p><p>SIMILAR LISTINGS. </p><p> </p><p>4. COUNTER-TERRORISM LAWS </p><p> </p><p>A NEW LAW REFORMING THE SPANISH NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER </p><p>WENT INTO EFFECT IN MAY.  ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE LAW IS TO </p><p>PROMOTE COOPERATION BETWEEN SPANISH INTELLIGENCE SERVICES </p><p>AND THOSE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  KEEPING TRACK OF ISLAMIST </p><p>EXTREMIST CELLS IN SPAIN IS A HIGH PRIORITY OF THE SPANISH </p><p>POLICE AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>A NEW "LAW OF POLITICAL PARTIES" WENT INTO EFFECT IN JUNE. </p><p>THE LAW ESTABLISHES A JUDICIAL PROCESS TO DE-LEGALIZE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES THAT PROVIDE CONCRETE SUPPORT TO TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>IN OCTOBER, THE GOVERNING POPULAR PARTY AND THE MAIN </p><p>OPPOSITION SOCIALIST PARTY AGREED TO SUPPORT JOINTLY A DRAFT </p><p>LAW TO INCREASE SECURITY FOR POLITICIANS IN THE BASQUE </p><p>REGION WHO ARE THREATENED WITH ASSASSINATION.  THE LAW WOULD </p><p>INCREASE FUNDING TO PROVIDE MORE BODYGUARDS AND OTHER </p><p>PROTECTION FOR LOCAL POLITICIANS.  THE DRAFT LAW IS ON A </p><p>FAST TRACK; THE PARLIAMENT MAY PASS IT IN LATE DECEMBER </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN MAY, SPAIN RATIFIED THE UN CONVENTION ON SUPPRESSION </p><p>OF TERRORIST FINANCING.  SPAIN HAS NOW RATIFIED ALL 12 OF </p><p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>B. RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. ON AUGUST 26, JUDGE GARZON ISSUED AN ORDER CALLING FOR </p><p>THE IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OF BATASUNA\'S (ETA POLITICAL WING) </p><p>PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACTIVITIES FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS.  THE </p><p>SUSPENSION COULD BE EXTENDED TO A TOTAL OF FIVE YEARS.  THE </p><p>ORDER INCLUDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CLOSING OF ALL </p><p>BATASUNA OFFICES AND THE FREEZING OF ANY BATASUNA FINANCIAL </p><p>ASSETS.  LOCAL, REGIONAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS (AS WELL AS </p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT) ARE PROHIBITED FROM SUBSIDIZING </p><p>BATASUNA.  THE ORDER ALSO PROHIBITS ANY PRIVATE DONATIONS TO </p><p>BATASUNA. </p><p> </p><p>2. AS OF NOVEMBER, SPANISH POLICE HAD ARRESTED 120 PERSONS </p><p>FOR ASSOCIATION WITH OR MEMBERSHIP IN ETA, AND DISMANTLED 13 </p><p>ETA "CELLS." </p><p> </p><p>3. ON NOVEMBER 21, JUDGE GARZON ISSUED AN ORDER ACCUSING 22 </p><p>BATASUNA MEMBERS OF BELONGING TO ETA.  THIS ORDER EXPANDED </p><p>ON THE ONE GARZON ISSUED AUGUST 26 (FIRST PARAGRAPH IN THIS </p><p>SECTION).  OUT OF THE 22 BATASUNA LEADERS, SIX ARE MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE BASQUE REGIONAL PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN OCTOBER, THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ASKED THE </p><p>NATIONAL COURT TO ISSUE AN ORDER SUSPENDING THE ACTIVITIES </p><p>OF THE RECONSTRUCTED COMMUNIST PARTY OF SPAIN, WHICH IS </p><p>CONSIDERED TO BE THE POLITICAL ARM OF THE TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION GRAPO.  IN ADDITION TO THIS, DURING 2002, </p><p>TWENTY-TWO MEMBERS OF GRAPO WERE ARRESTED, EIGHT OF THEM IN </p><p>PARIS AND THE REST IN SPAIN (VITORIA, MADRID AND </p><p>VALLADOLID).   AS OF NOVEMBER, GRAPO HAD NOT CONDUCTED ANY </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS IN SPAIN IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>C. EXTRADITION OF TERRORISTS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>SINCE THE SIGNING IN OCTOBER 2001 OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT </p><p>BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN FOR TEMPORARY DELIVERY OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS IMPRISONED IN FRANCE TO STAND TRIAL IN SPAIN, </p><p>FRANCE HAS TRANSFERRED PRISONERS UNDER THE AGREEMENT THREE </p><p>TIMES.  IN ADDITION TO THESE TEMPORARY DELIVERIES, FRANCE </p><p>HAS EXTRADITED TO SPAIN FOUR ETA MEMBERS AND HAS EXPELLED </p><p>ONE. </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN HAS BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT WITHIN THE EU OF THE </p><p>EUROPEAN WIDE ARREST AND DETENTION ORDER (THE "EURO-ORDER"), </p><p>WHICH IT HOPES TO APPLY TO TERRORISTS ONCE THE MEASURE GOES </p><p>INTO FORCE IN THE EU. (SEE SECTION F). </p><p> </p><p>D. IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN HAS ALSO BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT WITHIN THE EU OF AN </p><p>EU-WIDE EXTRADITION AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S.  HOWEVER, SPAIN </p><p>SUPPORTS THE EU CONSENSUS OF OPPOSING EXTRADITION TO THE </p><p>U.S. IF A PRISONER WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE DEATH PENALTY.  A </p><p>U.S. REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS TO </p><p>MILITARY TRIBUNALS WOULD ALSO POSE PROBLEMS FOR THE SPANISH </p><p>JUDICIARY.  IN PRACTICE, EXTRADITION TO THE US IS POSSIBLE </p><p>ONCE SPANISH JUDICIAL CONCERNS REGARDING APPLICATION OF THE </p><p>DEATH PENALTY ARE RESOLVED (SPAIN WOULD INSIST ON ADVANCE </p><p>AGREEMENT THAT THE DEATH PENALTY NOT BE APPLIED TO PERSONS </p><p>EXTRADITED TO THE U.S.) </p><p> </p><p>E. OTHER HOST RESPONSES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>SPANISH GOVERNMENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THE WAR ON TERRORISM </p><p>HAVE BEEN VOCAL AND STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE, NOT ONLY IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF 9-11 AND AFGHANISTAN, BUT DURING SUBSEQUENT </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS (I.E. BALI, MOSCOW, KENYA). </p><p> </p><p>F. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 2002 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>ON OCTOBER 25, THE GOS SENT TO PARLIAMENT FOR RATIFICATION </p><p>THE DRAFT LAW OF THE EUROPEAN WARRANT OF ARREST (EURO- </p><p>ORDER).  SPAIN IS ONE OF SEVEN EU COUNTRIES TO HAVE MADE A </p><p>COMMITMENT TO START APPLYING THE LAW ONE YEAR EARLY, DURING </p><p>THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INSTEAD OF JANUARY 2004. </p><p> </p><p>IN MARCH, THE SPANISH COUNCIL OF MINISTERS APPROVED THE </p><p>SIGNING OF THE "EUROJUST" AGREEMENT ON JUDICIAL COOPERATION </p><p>AMONG EU COUNTRIES.  IN JUNE, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS </p><p>APPOINTED THE TWO MEMBERS WHO WILL REPRESENT SPAIN IN </p><p>EUROJUST. </p><p> </p><p>IN MAY, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS APPROVED A DRAFT LAW THAT </p><p>CALLED FOR CREATION OF JOINT INVESTIGATION TEAMS TO CARRY </p><p>OUT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS IN ANY OR ALL OF THE MEMBER </p><p>STATES.  THE DRAFT LAW WAS APPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK DECISION APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL OF EU JUSTICE AND </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS MINISTERS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2001. </p><p> </p><p>ON OCTOBER 16, SPANISH MINISTER OF INTERIOR ANGEL ACEBES </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT SPAIN, ALONG WITH GREECE, ITALY AND THE UK, </p><p>WOULD START A JOINT BORDER CONTROL AND SEAPORT CONTROL </p><p>OPERATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TO FIGHT TERRORISM AND </p><p>ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.   THE FIRST OPERATION IS SUPPOSED TO </p><p>TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE END OF 2002. </p><p> </p><p>WITH RESPECT TO THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN, FROM THE BEGINNING, </p><p>SPAIN HAS PROVIDED LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COALITION AUTHORIZING THE USE OF SPANISH MILITARY BASES AT </p><p>ROTA AND MORON.  WITHIN OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, SPAIN </p><p>HAS PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL HUMANITARIAN TRANSPORT MISSIONS; </p><p>IT CONTRIBUTED THREE C-130 HERCULES AND 70 SOLDIERS TO THE </p><p>AIRBORNE DETACHMENT GEMINIS.  THIS IS IN ADDITION TO SPAIN </p><p>HAVING AUTHORIZED THE PARTICIPATION OF SIX HELICOPTERS AND </p><p>ABOUT 150 SOLDIERS IN OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COALITION.  FROM JANUARY TO OCTOBER 2002, A </p><p>SPANISH MEDICAL DETACHMENT WAS PRESENT IN THE BAGRAM AIR </p><p>BASE (NEAR KABUL).  SPAIN IS HEADING A NAVAL TASK FORCE IN </p><p>THE HORN OF AFRICA TO DETECT AND DETER TERRORIST MOVEMENTS </p><p>IN THAT AREA.  SPAIN HAS ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE ACTIVE </p><p>ENDEAVOR AND COHERENT BEHAVIOR OPERATIONS, AND FOUR SPANISH </p><p>MILITARY ARE IN THE U.S. AS PART OF THE NATO\'S AWACS STAFF. </p><p>SPAIN\'S CURRENT CONTRIBUTION TO THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>ASSISTANCE FORCE (ISAF) IS ABOUT 300 SOLDIERS. </p><p> </p><p>G. AND H. NONE </p><p> </p><p>I. CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN HAS SUFFERED FROM ETA AND OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS FOR </p><p>OVER 30 YEARS.  SPAIN WELCOMES THE INCREASED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION IN COMBATING TERRORISM THAT HAS EMERGED SINCE 9- </p><p>11.  SPAIN BELIEVES THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM HAS </p><p>TRANSLATED INTO INCREASED POLICE, JUDICIAL AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>POLITICAL PRESSURE ON ETA THAT IS TAKING A DEFINITE TOLL ON </p><p>ETA\'S OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS.  ETA ATTACKS AND KILLINGS </p><p>ARE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY THUS FAR IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>J. U.S. COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS WITH THE HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL ASHCROFT MET SEPTEMBER 14 WITH THE SPANISH </p><p>INTERIOR AND JUSTICE MINISTERS IN COPENHAGEN.  THE ATTORNEY </p><p>GENERAL REITERATED THE U.S. COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT SPAIN IN </p><p>ITS FIGHT AGAINST ETA TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>IN FEBRUARY, THE UNITED STATES BLOCKED THE ASSETS OF 21 </p><p>PERSONS LINKED TO ETA.  IN JUNE, THE U.S. BLOCKED THE ASSETS </p><p>OF SEVEN MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH TIES TO ETA AND THE ETA- </p><p>LINKED ORGANIZATION, ASKATASUNA.  ANOTHER FOUR PERSONS </p><p>LINKED TO ETA WERE INCLUDED ON THE U.S. TERRORIST LIST IN </p><p>NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>THE SPANISH SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SECURITY MET IN FEBRUARY </p><p>WITH SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS.  DURING THAT MEETING HE PUBLICLY </p><p>RESTATED SPAIN\'S INTENTION TO HELP THE U.S. IN ITS FIGHT </p><p>AGAINST ISLAMIST EXTREMIST TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>DURING 2002, DOJ AND FBI EXPERTS WORKED WITH THE SPANISH </p><p>NATIONAL COURT TO ASSIST IN THE ANALYSIS OF DOCUMENTS </p><p>UNCOVERED IN INVESTIGATIONS OF AL QAEDA SUSPECTS OPERATING </p><p>IN SPAIN. </p><p> </p><p>K. AND L.  NO INFORMATION TO REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>ARGYROS </p><p></p></div>
