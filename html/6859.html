<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000552 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD/ISA - LILIENFELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, IN, NP, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  KING\'S CONFIDANT ON INDIAN, EUROPEAN </p><p>SUPPORT FOR PEACE PROCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  On March 26 royal confidant Prabhakar Rana briefed </p><p>the Ambassador and DCM on his recent secret discussions with </p><p>foreign government representatives in India and Europe. </p><p>Indian National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra reportedly </p><p>emphasized to Rana that while the GOI supports Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) efforts to engage Maoists in dialogue, it </p><p>unequivocally opposes third-party mediation or facilitation </p><p>in that endeavor.  Rana reported that in a positive meeting </p><p>Mishra denied any recent "cooling" in bilateral relations </p><p>between the two governments and acknowledged with gratitude </p><p>that the GON had informally "handed over" 45 suspected </p><p>Kashmiri militants to the GOI.  Mishra reportedly assured </p><p>Rana that USG security assistance to Nepal is "no longer a </p><p>problem" for the GOI.  The GOI would support a royal proposal </p><p>to form an all-party interim government, Mishra said, but </p><p>strongly urged that the post of prime minister not be given </p><p>to the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(UML).  In meetings with British Defense Secretary Geoffrey </p><p>Hoon, UK Special Envoy for Nepal Jeffrey James, and other </p><p>senior FCO officials in London; EU Commissioner Chris Patten </p><p>in Brussels; and members of the European Parliament in </p><p>Strasbourg, Rana said his interlocutors expressed support for </p><p>GON efforts to engage the Maoists in dialogue.  Hoon </p><p>reportedly emphasized that if negotiations fail to bring </p><p>about a peaceful resolution, his government will continue to </p><p>offer development and military assistance to the GON.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>DIPLOMATIC BLITZKRIEG </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On March 26 Prabhakar Rana, King Gyanendra\'s </p><p>confidant, business partner, and secret emissary, briefed the </p><p>Ambassador and DCM on discussions held during Rana\'s March </p><p>9-16 trip to India and Europe.  Rana said he undertook the </p><p>trip at King Gyanendra\'s behest as "a diplomatic survey" of </p><p>Indian, British, and EU support for ongoing Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) efforts to engage Maoist insurgents in dialogue. </p><p>Rana reported receiving a sympathetic hearing from foreign </p><p>government representatives at all stops in his visit. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>NO "COOLNESS" IN GOI/GON BILATERAL RELATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Rana said he first met with Indian National Security </p><p>Advisor Brajesh Mishra in New Delhi.  (The meeting was held </p><p>in part to prepare the ground for King Gyanendra\'s private </p><p>trip to India beginning on March 18.)  Rana opened the </p><p>meeting by asking Mishra directly the reason for a recent </p><p>"perceived coolness" in bilateral relations between the GON </p><p>and the Government of India (GOI).  Mishra reportedly </p><p>dismissed any suggestion that relations had cooled at senior </p><p>levels.  The GON makes an effort to keep its large southern </p><p>neighbor alerted to impending developments, he acknowledged, </p><p>although he noted GOI disappointment that events do not </p><p>always unravel as GON representatives predict them to Indian </p><p>interlocutors.  He cited the King\'s surprise October 11 </p><p>appointment of Lokendra Bahadur Chand as interim Prime </p><p>Minister--after the GOI had been informally told someone else </p><p>would be the nominee--as a prominent example.  Rana rejoined </p><p>that unforeseeable events sometimes occur but emphasized the </p><p>GON\'s continued willingness and intention to keep the GOI as </p><p>well informed and forewarned as possible. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>GOI WILL SUPPORT DIALOGUE-- </p><p>BUT NO THIRD-PARTY INTERVENTION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Mishra reportedly said the GOI welcomes GON efforts </p><p>to bring Maoist insurgents to the negotiating table and to </p><p>find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  He stressed, </p><p>however, that the GOI absolutely would not tolerate any </p><p>involvement of third parties, either as facilitators or </p><p>mediators, in the peace process.  He indicated that the GOI </p><p>was aware of the Maoists attempting to reach out to certain </p><p>European donors to establish a channel for dialogue (septel). </p><p> Rana reassured Mishra that the GON and GOI see eye to eye on </p><p>this issue and that the GON has no plans to involve third </p><p>parties. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>GOI: USG SECURITY ASSISTANCE "NO LONGER A PROBLEM" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Rana said he asked Mishra if the GOI had concerns or </p><p>reservations regarding US and UK security assistance to </p><p>Nepal.  Rana said he emphasized that improved security in </p><p>Nepal is one area in which USG and GOI objectives coincide, </p><p>and noted that the British, Indian, and U.S. missions in </p><p>Nepal are working closely together to achieve that aim with </p><p>"unprecedented transparency."  Mishra reportedly acknowledged </p><p>some initial GOI concerns that the weapons and training </p><p>provided to the Royal Nepal Army might be inappropriately </p><p>"sophisticated."  The GOI now "knows everything" about USG </p><p>security assistance to Nepal, which is thus "no longer a </p><p>problem," Mishra said.  The GOI is "a little concerned," </p><p>however, about possible Chinese reactions to USG assistance. </p><p>Rana told Mishra that the GON had received no indications of </p><p>Chinese discomfort with the assistance.  (Note:  Nor have we. </p><p> End note.)  According to Rana, Mishra added that Chinese </p><p>influence in Nepal is "no longer a threat to (Indian) </p><p>security and hasn\'t been for years." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>GOI ACKNOWLEDGES GON HELP ON MILITANTS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Rana said he raised repeated GOI charges that the GON </p><p>fails to apprehend anti-Indian extremists the GOI believes </p><p>operate on Nepali soil.  Rana said he reminded Mishra that </p><p>the King had pledged assistance in a visit to India the </p><p>previous year.  Since then, the GON has quietly turned 45 </p><p>Kashmiri militants over to the GOI in recent months, a point </p><p>he said Mishra conceded and gratefully acknowledged.  Nepal </p><p>has asserted greater control over the madrassas operating </p><p>within its borders than has India, Rana also claimed, which, </p><p>he indicated, Mishra did not challenge.  GOI accusations that </p><p>Nepal is soft on extremists are thus unmerited, Rana </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>GOI WILL SUPPORT ALL-PARTY GOVERNMENT-- </p><p>BUT NOT ONE HEADED BY UML </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Noting that the King\'s previous attempts to bring </p><p>the political parties into the interim government had failed, </p><p>Rana told Mishra that the only real option left is for the </p><p>King to appoint a new interim government with political party </p><p>representation.  Rana emphasized that the GON would </p><p>appreciate GOI support in influencing Nepal\'s political </p><p>parties to participate in such a government.  Mishra </p><p>reportedly committed to supporting such an endeavor, but </p><p>noted that the GOI would need sufficient time--as much as </p><p>three or four months--to bring the parties around.  According </p><p>to Rana, Mishra urged against nominating Communist Party of </p><p>Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML), currently the largest </p><p>party, to head such a government.  Since the Maoists consider </p><p>the UML ideological enemies, Mishra reasoned, it is more </p><p>prudent to leave both the Maoists and the UML--or at least </p><p>UML leader Madhav Nepal--out of the government to fight each </p><p>other.  Rana said he replied that the Palace would like to </p><p>move more quickly than Mishra\'s prospective timeframe, adding </p><p>that if proposed dialogue with the Maoists goes as well as </p><p>hoped the new interim government must be in place in order to </p><p>oversee elections. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>UK DEFSEC PLEDGES FULL SUPPORT; </p><p>EU WELL BRIEFED AND SYMPATHETIC </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Rana\'s next meetings were with UK Secretary of </p><p>Defense Geoffrey Hoon, UK Special Envoy for Nepal Jeffrey </p><p>James, and other senior FCO officials in London.  According </p><p>to Rana, Hoon told him that the British Government respects </p><p>and supports the King\'s courageous decision to enter into a </p><p>ceasefire and pursue dialogue with the Maoists.  While the UK </p><p>fully believes in the importance of pursuing a peaceful </p><p>resolution, should negotiation efforts prove unsuccessful, </p><p>Hoon pledged full support for development and military </p><p>assistance.  Rana said he also discussed GON peace efforts </p><p>with EU Commissioner for External Affairs Chris Patten in </p><p>Brussels.  Rana described Patten as well briefed on Nepali </p><p>affairs and sympathetic to GON aims.  Finally, Rana said he </p><p>briefed members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the </p><p>European Parliament in Strasbourg, where, he noted, Italian </p><p>member and famed mountaineer Reinhold Messner of the European </p><p>Free Alliance is chairman of the SAARC Sub-committee and an </p><p>especially enthusiastic advocate for Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S)  Rana\'s lengthy, detailed readout of his meeting with </p><p>the Indian National Security Advisor underscores the pivotal </p><p>role this giant neighbor continues to exercise in domestic </p><p>Nepali politics.  It is instructive--but not surprising--that </p><p>the Palace should enlist Indian influence in persuading </p><p>recalcitrant political parties to join a new interim </p><p>government.  Indian opposition to a UML-led government, even </p><p>without the Maoists\' antipathy toward their erstwhile </p><p>comrades, might well be enough to scuttle the largest party\'s </p><p>long-cherished hopes of gaining the PM\'s chair.  Even clearer </p><p>is the GOI\'s categorical opposition to any possible </p><p>third-party mediation efforts.   We predict this resounding </p><p>"no" from New Delhi will torpedo bids by some European </p><p>missions here to play peacemaker in prospective talks. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
