<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 003076 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA, WHA/CEN, AND WHA/CCA </p><p>STATE FOR INR, S/CT, AND DS/ICI/ITA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: X1, X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ETTC, PINR, PTER, ASEC, EAID, HO, CU </p><p>SUBJECT: (S) CUBAN NOMINEE FOR AMBASSADOR TO HONDURAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY APPROVED BY GOH AND SOON TO BE ANNOUNCED; </p><p>HONDURAN ARMED FORCES ALLEGE POLANCO IS CUBAN INTELLIGENCE </p><p>OFFICER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. OLSEN/TRIVELLI E-MAIL 11/05/02 </p><p>     B. STATE 205386 </p><p>     C. TD-314/39339-02 </p><p>     D. PALMIERI/TRIVELLI E-MAIL 08/20/02 </p><p>     E. TEGUCIGALPA 618 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer; Reasons 1.5 (B), (C), and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para. 9. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Summary:  A Honduran Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>official has told the Embassy that the GOH has accepted the </p><p>Cuban nomination of Dr. Elis Alberto Gonzalez Polanco, Chief </p><p>of the Cuban Medical Brigades in Honduras, as the first Cuban </p><p>Ambassador to Honduras since the GOH normalized diplomatic </p><p>relations with Cuba January 26, 2002.  The same MFA official </p><p>has said that this information would be made public shortly. </p><p>ORCA sources have indicated that the Honduran Armed Forces </p><p>have urged President Ricardo Maduro not to approve the </p><p>nomination due to Polanco\'s alleged activities for Cuban </p><p>intelligence.  It is unclear if President Maduro has in fact </p><p>approved Polanco.  Post is disappointed by the GOH\'s action </p><p>and requests urgent guidance on whether EmbOffs should </p><p>attempt to persuade the GOH to disapprove Polanco\'s </p><p>nomination.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S)  The GOH normalized diplomatic relations with Cuba </p><p>January 26, 2002, 40 years after relations were broken, in </p><p>one of the last acts of the outgoing Flores Administration </p><p>(ref E).  Prior to the decision Honduras and Cuba had </p><p>maintained interests sections.  The Embassy was not notified </p><p>in advance of the GOH\'s action.  The decision, which incoming </p><p>President Ricardo Maduro told EmbOffs took him by surprise, </p><p>was quickly ratified, in essence, by a January 27 public </p><p>statement made by Maduro\'s Foreign Minister, Guillermo </p><p>Perez-Cadalso Arias.  Since then the Cuban diplomatic mission </p><p>has been headed by a Charge d\'Affaires.  The GOH has not </p><p>taken any concrete steps to name a Honduran Ambassador to </p><p>Cuba. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) EmbOffs have queried MFA officials since January for </p><p>updates on the possible exchange of ambassadors between the </p><p>GOC and the GOH (ref D).  While the MFA has been circumspect, </p><p>PolOffs have requested advance notice before the public </p><p>naming of ambassadors. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In a November 5 meeting between PolOff and MFA </p><p>Director General for Foreign Policy Ambassador Mario Fortin </p><p>to demarche the MFA on the issue of Cuban doctors (ref B), </p><p>PolOff asked Fortin for an update on the status of diplomatic </p><p>relations between Honduras and Cuba.  Fortin told PolOff that </p><p>Cuba had nominated and the GOH had approved Dr. Elis Alberto </p><p>"Orestes" Gonzalez Polanco, DPOB 25MAY1948 in San Pablo de </p><p>Yao, Granma Province, Cuba, as the Cuban Ambassador to </p><p>Honduras.  Dr. Polanco, as he is commonly referred to, has </p><p>been the head of the Cuban Medical Brigades in Honduras since </p><p>1998 (post-Hurricane Mitch).  (Note:  There are an estimated </p><p>100 (GOH/MFA) to 300/400 (USAID/Honduras) Cuban doctors </p><p>currently in Honduras.  See septel for more information on </p><p>the issue of Cuban doctors in Honduras.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) ORCA sources have indicated that the Honduran Armed </p><p>Forces have urged President Maduro not to approve Polanco\'s </p><p>nomination due to Polanco\'s alleged activities for Cuban </p><p>intelligence.  (Note: See ref C for more information on </p><p>Polanco.  End Note.)  ORCA has not been able to independently </p><p>confirm that Polanco is a Cuban intelligence officer, but </p><p>would not dispute that some of the Cuban "doctors" sent to </p><p>Honduras may be Cuban intelligence officers. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Despite Fortin\'s statement that the GOH had already </p><p>approved Polanco\'s nomination, Post does not know if </p><p>President Maduro has in fact given his approval to Polanco. </p><p>Fortin claimed that the approval of Polanco\'s nomination </p><p>would be made public in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Fortin told PolOff that there was nothing new </p><p>regarding the possible naming of a Honduran Ambassador to </p><p>Cuba, something that Maduro had told Ambassador Almaguer </p><p>February 1 would not be high on his list of priorities (ref </p><p>E).  To date Post has not heard of any names being considered </p><p>by the GOH to possibly fill this position. </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Action request for WHA:  Post requests urgent guidance </p><p>on whether EmbOffs should attempt to persuade the GOH to </p><p>disapprove the nomination of Polanco as Cuban Ambassador to </p><p>Honduras prior to the potentially imminent public </p><p>announcement of Polanco\'s approval by the GOH. </p><p>10. (C) Comment:  Post was disappointed to learn that the </p><p>Maduro Administration has apparently approved and is set to </p><p>announce a suspected Cuban intelligence officer as Cuban </p><p>Ambassador to Honduras.  While the process for GOH acceptance </p><p>of a Cuban Ambassador was set in motion in January, it is </p><p>unclear why the GOH has not rejected Polanco and demanded </p><p>that the GOC not nominate someone thought to be a Cuban </p><p>intelligence officer by the GOH itself.  Post notes that the </p><p>GOH does not appear to be making any movement toward </p><p>nominating a Honduran Ambassador to Cuba.  In addition, the </p><p>MFA\'s action to provide advance notice to the Embassy of the </p><p>Maduro Administration\'s controversial decision on this issue </p><p>is in stark contrast with the complete lack of advance </p><p>warning by the Flores Administration to the USG.  End Comment. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
