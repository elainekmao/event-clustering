<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 NASSAU 000586 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: BF, ECON, EFIN, PREL, CARICOM </p><p>SUBJECT: CARICOM SECGEN WANTS BAHAMAS IN SINGLE MARKET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT M. WITAJEWSKI, REASON 1.5 (B AND D) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CARICOM Secretary General Edwin Carrington, using </p><p>fairly blunt language for diplomatic discourse, publicly </p><p>warned The Bahamas that it needed to get in line with the </p><p>rest of the region in regard to the Caribbean Single Market. </p><p>He strongly implied that The Bahamas could not remain a </p><p>member of CARICOM if it does not subscribe to the Single </p><p>Market, which it has not to this point.  Carrington\'s words </p><p>did not go over well in a country that sees little to gain </p><p>and much to lose in a Caribbean Single Market, and could help </p><p>spur The Bahamas to consider where its economic future lies. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Carrington Pressures </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Sec-Gen Carrington made his public comments at a </p><p>seminar on CARICOM sponsored by the College of The Bahamas. </p><p>Also speaking on the panel were Minister of State for Finance </p><p>James Smith, attorney Reginald Lobosky, economist Gilbert </p><p>Morris and Desiree Field-Riddley, adviser to the Caribbean </p><p>Market and Economy. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Carrington called for The Bahamas, which has </p><p>declined to participate in the Single Market to this point, </p><p>to quickly make a decision to accede.  He said that The </p><p>Bahamas must "move, and move swiftly."  Carrington devoted </p><p>most of his presentation to addressing concerns most </p><p>Bahamians have with joining the Single Market (and the FTAA, </p><p>truth be told).  He acknowledged that, as a service driven </p><p>economy that produces few goods for export, The Bahamas had </p><p>comparatively little to gain from market opening in the </p><p>region, but said that what little The Bahamas does produce is </p><p>not competitive without that opening.  He dismissed concerns </p><p>with the movement of skilled labor (The Bahamas, with its </p><p>higher income levels, is a magnet for economic migration from </p><p>the rest of the region) and the common currency (any change </p><p>from the current one-to-one interchangeability of the </p><p>Bahamian and U.S. dollars could lead to sharp devaluation and </p><p>loss of wealth in The Bahamas) by saying that The Bahamas </p><p>could always use treaty language to opt out of those sections. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  In the conclusion of his presentation, Carrington </p><p>turned strangely threatening, however.  He said that this is </p><p>"a question, not just of the single market and economy </p><p>membership, but of CARICOM membership indeed."  Carrington </p><p>explained that the new legal structure of CARICOM requires </p><p>that all member countries sign all agreements in their </p><p>entirety, and that therefore, if The Bahamas reserves itself </p><p>from the Single Market, it would be in violation of its </p><p>responsibilities as a CARICOM member.  The audience took this </p><p>to mean that, if The Bahamas continues to hold itself out of </p><p>the Single Market, it could be forced out of CARICOM. </p><p>Carrington ominously warned that, "in this day and age, for a </p><p>small country to be on its own in international waters, is </p><p>not the most propitious of options." </p><p> </p><p>Bahamian Government Responds </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Minister Smith, in his presentation took exception </p><p>to Carrington\'s depiction of The Bahamas\' lack of options. </p><p>He said that The Bahamas, contrary to what Carrington said, </p><p>had three legal options: to join the single market, to be an </p><p>associate member through a separate agreement, or to continue </p><p>to opt out.  He did not respond to Carrington\'s threat to </p><p>Bahamian CARICOM membership.  He and other panelists called </p><p>clearly for The Bahamas to consider carefully its own </p><p>economic interests before committing to the Single Market. </p><p>Smith did acknowledge that, if the FTAA becomes a reality, </p><p>many of the same issues would have to be addressed. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  In a March 17 meeting that Ambassador and DCM had </p><p>with Foreign Minister Fred Mitchell, the Ambassador raised </p><p>the CARICOM Secretary General,s public comments.  Minister </p><p>Mitchell admitted to being &surprised8 by the Carrington </p><p>quotes, acknowledged that they were &impolitis8 and agreed </p><p>that they made a &tough sell (on a single market) even </p><p>harder.8  He admitted that the Leader of the Opposition had </p><p>also called him earlier that morning for an explanation of </p><p>Carrington,s public comments.  The Foreign Minister said he </p><p>was confident, however, that The Bahamas could have it both </p><p>ways ) continue membership in CARICOM but exercise the </p><p>reserve clause on the issues such as labor mobility. </p><p>7.  (U)  Carrington\'s comments were generally seen as </p><p>threatening and were not well received.  Leading daily "The </p><p>Nassau Guardian" warned against precipitous action and called </p><p>for the government to consider Bahamian economic interests </p><p>first and to not commit fully to any organization or </p><p>agreement that was not fully in The Bahamas\' interest. </p><p> </p><p>BLANKENSHIP </p><p></p></div>
