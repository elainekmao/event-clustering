<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000161 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, ELTN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Metalwork company may close </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  Another pillar of Zimbabwe\'s economic </p><p>infrastructure may crumble.  The Zimbabwe Iron and Steel </p><p>Company (ZISCO), a parastatal and the country\'s sole </p><p>iron/steel manufacturing company, seems headed for closure </p><p>unless Government comes up with a costly rescue package. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Formerly Africa\'s largest steelworks </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>2.  After an act of parliament created ZISCO in 1942, </p><p>operations started at Redcliff in 1946, with the first iron </p><p>produced in 1949.  For many African industrialists, ZISCO </p><p>has made an important historical mark, since it became the </p><p>largest integrated steelworks in black Africa in the sixties </p><p>and seventies.  It remains a vital source of steel for </p><p>products used in Zimbabwe\'s agricultural, mining, metal </p><p>foundry and construction industries.   However, the GOZ has </p><p>badly mismanaged the plant since Independence, racking up </p><p>debts of US$ 67.3 million.  Some 18 studies by international </p><p>consultants over the years have recommended modernization of </p><p>the aging plant and equipment. </p><p> </p><p>Steel vital for economy </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>3. Lacking forex for imports, Zimbabwean companies rely </p><p>heavily on the company for raw materials.  A sizable number </p><p>of unemployed (at least in the formal sense) Zimbabweans are </p><p>engaged in some form of metal-fabricating activity. The </p><p>closure of ZISCO would thus add to the country\'s already </p><p>high unemployment. </p><p> </p><p>4. On its own, ZISCO employs as many as 6,000, who support </p><p>over 20,000 dependents at its Redcliff plant. In addition, </p><p>the company\'s subsidiaries of Lancashire Steel and Bucwa </p><p>Iron ore mine collectively employ 1,350 with over 6,000 </p><p>dependents. It was once reckoned that every steelworker </p><p>indirectly creates employment for 25,000 others in upstream </p><p>and downstream industries such as mining of ore and </p><p>limestone, foundries, rolling mills, engineering and steel </p><p>fabricating plants. </p><p> </p><p>Political meddling </p><p>------------------ </p><p>5.  The GOZ has frequently changed managers at ZISCO without </p><p>rhyme or reason.  ZISCO managers have tried and failed </p><p>repeatedly to launch a fourth blast furnace that could </p><p>nearly triple output.  In 1998, the GOZ tried briefly to </p><p>privatize ZISCO and its associated companies.  There were no </p><p>serious offers as prospective buyers already saw which way </p><p>the wind was blowing. The Government then invited a number </p><p>of countries, including China, to aid the rehabilitation. </p><p>Lots of talks ensued, but little concrete assistance </p><p>materialized. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6.  ZISCO provides yet another snapshot of the de- </p><p>industrialization of Zimbabwe, whose economy has already </p><p>shed 35 percent of real GDP in 5 years.  Eternally </p><p>optimistic Zimbabweans like to reassure themselves that the </p><p>country will bounce back once it has rational government. </p><p>However, it could take generations to repair the damage to </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s infrastructure if the economy continues to lose </p><p>one percent of each month for another year or so. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
