<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000669 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MEETING WITH PDP CHAIRMAN </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Ambassador met with People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party (PDP) National Chairman Audu Ogbeh on </p><p>Wednesday April 9.  The two discussed the upcoming elections </p><p>and the ruling party\'s prospects, as well as the anti- </p><p>violence Code of Conduct for the parties and INEC\'s </p><p>preparedness.  Ogbeh agreed to sign the Code of Conduct and </p><p>promised he would try to do so jointly with the opposition </p><p>ANPP. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>IS EVERYTHING READY? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PDP National Chairman Audu Ogbeh opposed the idea of </p><p>a postponement of elections.  (NOTE: Several opposition </p><p>parties have been advocating that a delay was needed because </p><p>of their concern about The Independent National Electoral </p><p>Commission\'s (INEC) preparedness for conducting the </p><p>elections. END NOTE) The constitution declares that all </p><p>office holders must relinquish their authority at midnight </p><p>on May 28.  If the elections are not held and a new </p><p>Administration not sworn in on May 29, the government would </p><p>be operating with no constitutional authority.  Such an </p><p>extra-constitutional "remedy" would set a hugely negative </p><p>precedent for Nigeria and the rest of Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ogbeh admitted INEC had numerous problems but said it </p><p>was in a position to hold the elections.  The voters\' </p><p>register has been displayed, and the parties are set to </p><p>receive CD-ROMs of the voters roll this week.  Ogbeh felt </p><p>that one reason many Nigerians have disparaged INEC was that </p><p>most people have not traveled to their wards to inspect the </p><p>lists themselves.  Another problem, Ogbeh said, is the space </p><p>for the thumbprint on the ballots.  During Ogbeh\'s meeting </p><p>with INEC and other parties the day before, he said it was </p><p>agreed that the index finger rather than the thumb could be </p><p>used for marking the ballot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>PDP\'S CHANCES </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ogbeh thought the PDP campaign was doing very well, </p><p>better than other parties.  However, he predicted violence </p><p>in Lagos and Benue.  Other states where violence could occur </p><p>are Akwa-Ibom, Cross River, Kwara and Plateau.  He predicted </p><p>there would be no violence in Kano or Kaduna. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In the Muslim North, Ogbeh predicted President </p><p>Obasanjo would win in Kano and Kebbi, with Katsina a toss-up </p><p>between the President and Buhari.  He also predicted that </p><p>two-thirds of the South-East would vote for Obasanjo.  With </p><p>Obasanjo doing well in the South-East and in some Northern </p><p>states, Ogbeh was confident of victory, expecting 60 to 65 </p><p>percent of the overall vote on the first ballot; there would </p><p>be no run-off.  In gubernatorial elections, he predicted PDP </p><p>losses in Anambra and Borno, with Plateau a possibility; </p><p>however, the PDP would make gains in Oyo, Ekiti and Osun, </p><p>and possibly Ogun.  Ogbeh admitted that too many PDP gains </p><p>in the South-West would cause problems, as the area had been </p><p>exclusively controlled by the Alliance for Democracy Party </p><p>(AD).  However, the AD could no longer argue that the South- </p><p>West should be its exclusive preserve since the AD itself </p><p>was contesting elections in Borno, Benue, Anambra and </p><p>Plateau.  This abrogated any prior PDP assurances that it </p><p>would not contest in the South-West. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>CODE OF CONDUCT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador Jeter asked that the PDP sign the INEC </p><p>Code of Conduct.  The Code had been signed by all but four </p><p>of the 30 parties.  Two of the four were the PDP and ANPP, </p><p>the main opposition.  Jeter stressed that signing the Code </p><p>was symbolically important for the entire nation.  This </p><p>would have even greater impact if the PDP and ANPP signed </p><p>together.  Ogbeh agreed and promised to get in touch with </p><p>ANPP Chairman Etiebet to request that the two party chairmen </p><p>sign together the next day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT: Despite a merciless campaign schedule, Chairman </p><p>Ogbeh was relaxed throughout the meeting and appeared </p><p>genuinely confident that Obasanjo would retain the </p><p>Presidency.  His measurement of Obasanjo\'s strength in the </p><p>North does not completely tally with ours.  However, Ogbeh\'s </p><p>assessment of the gubernatorial races seemed objective and </p><p>realistic.  Ogbeh\'s agreement to sign the Code of Conduct </p><p>was welcome news.  Although late in the game, anything that </p><p>can be done to discourage violence and encourage responsible </p><p>political behavior will help. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
