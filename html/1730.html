(U) AF/RA Michael Bittrick and PolMilOff paid a courtesy </p><p>call (the first received by the Committee) on Nigeria\'s new </p><p>National Committee on the ECOWAS Moratorium on Small Arms </p><p>and Light Weapons.  Committee Chairman Musa Yahaya and </p><p>committee members Police Deputy Commissioner Lawrence Alobi </p><p>(a long-time contact of Embassy RSO), a representative of </p><p>the Nigerian State Security Service, and a Customs Service </p><p>representative were in attendance.  The Commission also </p><p>includes representatives from the National Intelligence </p><p>Agency, Immigration, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the </p><p>military, but since the Committee was only recently </p><p>inaugurated by President Obasanjo (May 7), not all members </p><p>were present.  The Committee is housed in the Ministry of </p><p>Cooperation and Integration in Africa, and reports to the </p><p>Minister of that government agency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Chairman Yahaya outlined the history of the ECOWAS </p><p>Moratorium, noting it was signed by Heads of State on </p><p>October 31, 1998, and that a Code of Conduct was signed in </p><p>1999.  Yahaya said the objectives of the Nigerian Committee </p><p>include: establishment of a culture of peace (meaning a </p><p>public affairs drive, seminars, and state-level offices); </p><p>facilitation of dialogue with producers and suppliers; </p><p>enhancing weapons control at border posts; establishment of </p><p>a database (for information and to house a weapons </p><p>registry); collection and destruction of illicit small </p><p>arms; and mobilization of resources (essentially, requests </p><p>for assistance from donor nations and manufacturers). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Yahaya noted that, while small arms were a major </p><p>problem in West Africa, the sub-region did not produce many </p><p>weapons.  There was a need to reduce the role of weapons in </p><p>solving conflicts in Africa, and to "find a more dignified </p><p>way," such as mediation and dialogue.  Therefore, the </p><p>Committee would work with manufacturers and exporting </p><p>nations to reduce the number of illicit arms in </p><p>circulation.  Yahaya went on to say that the Committee </p><p>would seek technical assistance and train-the-trainer </p><p>programs, and asked that Washington consider providing </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Bittrick noted that, in some cases, states in the </p><p>sub-region had sought to purchase or import arms without </p><p>coordinating with the ECOWAS Secretariat, and that it was </p><p>difficult for the U.S. to press the issue since not all </p><p>ECOWAS states had ratified the Moratorium.  Yahaya said </p><p>that this was why the Committee would seek dialogue with </p><p>producer states, manufacturers and others, and asked that </p><p>an effort be made to coordinate arms importation requests </p><p>both with national committees and with ECOWAS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Bittrick then asked if illicit arms were a </p><p>significant problem in Nigeria, and how illicit arms came </p><p>into circulation.  Deputy Commissioner of Police Alobi </p><p>explained that the Nigerian Firearms Act defined two types </p><p>of weapons, large arms (military-type weapons) prohibited </p><p>except by decision of the President, and personal arms </p><p>("like shotguns for hunting") which could be approved by </p><p>the Police.  Alobi said that illicit arms enter Nigeria </p><p>through border towns, usually over land routes, though some </p><p>are produced locally (mostly single-shot handguns and </p><p>rifles).  He noted that illicit arms in Nigeria were a </p><p>serious contributor to crime, and in some cases, to inter- </p><p>communal conflict.  (DAO NOTE: Criminals possess large </p><p>quantities of illicitly obtained Nigerian military and </p><p>police weapons as well as weapons smuggled into Nigeria </p><p>from neighboring states.  END DAO NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: Nigeria\'s National Committee was formed </p><p>just four months before the expiration/renewal date of the </p><p>ECOWAS Moratorium.  It will take some time for the </p><p>Committee to establish itself, and to identify its needs. </p><p>Until that happens, the Embassy believes it would be </p><p>inadvisable to begin a discussion of technical assistance </p><p>for stockpile management and destruction.  However, we will </p><p>continue to monitor the Committee\'s progress, and will seek </p><p>additional information on the issue of illicit small arms </p><p>and light weapons in Nigeria, as the Committee pursues its </p><p>mandate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) LTC Bittrick did not clear this cable before </p><p>departing Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Freetown Minimize Considered. </p><p></p></div>
