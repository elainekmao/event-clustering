<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HAVANA 006938 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:        PTER, CU </p><p>SUBJECT:     CUBA: 1993 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:         STATE 317207 </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C)  SUMMARY.  THE SEVERE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN CUBA </p><p>FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM IN EUROPE HAS </p><p>IMPOSED LIMITS ON CUBAN CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT </p><p>TERRORISM ON ANYTHING LIKE PAST LEVELS.  POST IS NOT </p><p>AWARE OF NEW EVIDENCE IN 1993 OF CUBAN MATERIAL SUPPORT </p><p>FOR ARMED INSURGENCIES.  NEVERTHELESS, CUBA MAINTAINS </p><p>CLOSE RELATIONS WITH MOST "TERRORIST STATES" AND </p><p>CONTINUES TO SERVE AS A REFUGE FOR KNOWN TERRORISTS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U)  MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS.  IN AN EFFORT </p><p>TO APPEAL TO FELLOW LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS, THE </p><p>CUBAN REGIME HAS PUBLICLY TRIED TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS IN THE HEMISPHERE.  ENDING </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE GUERRILLAS IN COLOMBIA WAS SAID TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN A PRE-CONDITION FOR FIDEL CASTRO\'S VISIT TO </p><p>CARTAGENA AUGUST 9-11, AND WAS PART OF THE JUSTIFICATION </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT GAVE FOR RESTORING DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS WITH HAVANA IN LATE OCTOBER.  AS FOR </p><p>GUATEMALA, THE OTHER COUNTRY MOST AFFECTED BY FORMERLY </p><p>CUBAN-BACKED REBELS, THE OFFICIAL CUBAN PRESS MADE </p><p>GUARDEDLY CONCILIATORY STATEMENTS TOWARD THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS THERE DURING THE VISIT OF NOBEL LAUREATE </p><p>RIGOBERTA MENCHU TO HAVANA IN EARLY AUGUST. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U)  RELATIONS WITH TERRORIST STATES.  CUBA HAS </p><p>FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH </p><p>KOREA, AND SYRIA.  ALL THESE COUNTRIES HAVE EMBASSIES IN </p><p>HAVANA, AS DOES CUBA IN EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE </p><p>CAPITALS.  RELATIONS WITH IRAN AND NORTH KOREA ARE </p><p>PARTICULARLY CLOSE AND HIGH PROFILE.  THE PLO IS ALSO </p><p>REPRESENTED HERE AT THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (U)  PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON TERRORISM.  THE </p><p>REGIME-CONTROLLED CUBAN PRESS IS CAREFUL TO ESCHEW </p><p>EXPLICIT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS.  NEVERTHELESS THERE </p><p>PERSISTS A SLANT SYMPATHETIC TO "NATIONAL LIBERATION </p><p>MOVEMENTS" AND SELF-STYLED MARXIST MOVEMENTS SUCH AS THE </p><p>SHINING PATH.  IN ADDITION THE STRIDENT ANTI-U.S. LINE </p><p>WHICH PERVADES CUBAN NEWS AND COMMENTARY SPILLS OVER </p><p>INTO ATTACKS ON U.S. COUNTERTERROR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS </p><p>THE SANCTIONS ON LIBYA, WHICH THE CUBANS HOLD UP AS AN </p><p>EXAMPLE OF THE WEST\'S "DOUBLE STANDARD.  AFTER YEARS OF </p><p>ONE-SIDED COVERAGE OF PALESTINIAN ISSUES, THE CUBAN </p><p>PRESS TREATED THE SEPTEMBER PEACE ACCORD RELATIVELY </p><p>OBJECTIVELY. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (U)  HARBORING/TRAINING FOREIGN TERRORISTS.  POST </p><p>IS NOT AWARE OF ANY NEW ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN IN 1993. </p><p>BASQUE TERRORISTS WHO SOUGHT REFUGE HERE SOME YEARS AGO </p><p>REMAIN, BUT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS ASSURED THE SPANISH </p><p>EMBASSY THAT NO FURTHER ASYLEES WOULD BE ACCEPTED. </p><p>SEVERAL THOUSAND FOREIGN STUDENTS FROM FORMER MARXIST </p><p>REGIMES LIKE SOUTH YEMEN OR NATIONAL LIBERATION </p><p>MOVEMENTS SUCH AS THE POLISARIO OR THE SUDANESE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>LIBERATION MOVEMENT CONTINUE TO ATTEND SPECIAL SCHOOLS </p><p>ON THE ISLE OF YOUTH.  HOWEVER THE MILITARY OR </p><p>PARA-MILITARY COMPONENT OF THESE PROGRAMS APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN REDUCED OR LARGELY ELIMINATED, AND THE NUMBERS </p><p>OF STUDENTS HAVE DECLINED, WITH FEW IF ANY NEW ARRIVALS. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (U)  THERE HAVE BEEN NO PROSECUTIONS OR </p><p>EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS MADE PUBLIC IN CUBA IN 1993. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
