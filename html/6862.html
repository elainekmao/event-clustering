<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002010 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 27: MARKETS QUIET; </p><p>FOREIGNERS OUT; TURKS SAY NO CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b, d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: While Turkish markets were relatively </p><p>quiet on March 27 am, a wide range of market and GOT contacts </p><p>tell us confidence in the government remains rock bottom. </p><p>This translates into ongoing serious concerns about the GOT\'s </p><p>ability to roll-over about $3 billion of debt in its local </p><p>T-bill market on April 8.  Treasury\'s cash reserves at that </p><p>date are likely to be about TL 1.8 quadrillion ($1.1 </p><p>billion).  One new wrinkle to the April 8 roll-over problem </p><p>is the large percentage of debt coming due which is held not </p><p>by Turkish banks but by the Turkish public (as much as 40 </p><p>percent.)  Treasury is pressing the IMF to schedule a Board </p><p>date for the Fourth Review before the April 9, but the GOT is </p><p>not moving quickly to resolve pending issues.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Flat, Volumes Thin </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In morning trading March 27, yields on T-bills were </p><p>unchanged at 64 percent compounded.  CEO of Disbank </p><p>(mid-sized Turkish bank) Bayazit told us banks were bringing </p><p>down yields ahead of the Monday March 31 end of first </p><p>quarter, when publicly traded banks report their balance </p><p>sheets to the shareholders.  After March 31, Bayazit expects </p><p>yields to resume their upward trend ahead of the April 9 $3 </p><p>billion debt redemption.   The lira was also unchanged at TL </p><p>1,710,000 to the dollar, and the Istanbul Stock Exchange </p><p>closed up 0.7 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRSA Chairman:  Capital Flight LImited, but </p><p>F/X Liquidity is a Problem </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Chairman of the Banking Regulatory and Supervision </p><p>Agency (BRSA) Engin Akcakoca told EconCouns March 27 that </p><p>market confidence in the Turkish government had never been </p><p>lower (his full remarks will be in septel).  On the banking </p><p>sector, he said for the moment there are liquidity problems </p><p>on the F/X side, but the Central Bank is stepping in to lower </p><p>its short-term borrowing rates (which have dropped from 12 to </p><p> 6 percent over past week), and to keep F/X lines open. </p><p>Nevertheless, "if withdrawals continue, we\'ll be in crisis </p><p>management mode." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Turkish bank customers are switching out of foreign </p><p>exchange and into Turkish lira, rather than transferring </p><p>capital out of the country.  They are taking advantage of </p><p>higher interest rates in the TL markets.   Per BRSA data, </p><p>Turkish banks report a total of $1.8 billion in withdrawals </p><p>of foreign currency deposits between March 14 and 25.  In </p><p>return, TL deposits have increased about TL 1 quadrillion and </p><p>T-bill sales have increased about TL 1.5 quadrillion. </p><p>Akcakoca estimates $100-200 million of F/X cash was taken out </p><p>of banking system and put under mattresses in this period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Concerns with April 9 $3 billion Debt Redemption </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) General Manager of Kocbank (a mid-sized Turkish </p><p>bank half-owned by Italy\'s Unito Credito) Kemal Kaya told us </p><p>the banks remain concerned with the roll-over of the April 9 </p><p>redemption.  The wild card in the April 8 auctions, per Kaya, </p><p>is the high percentage of the T-bills to be redeemed on April </p><p>9 which are owned by the Turkish public, not by the banks. </p><p>He estimates the percentage in public hands to be about 40 </p><p>percent.  While Turkish banks will want to roll-over their </p><p>T-bills, per Kaya, they do not want to buy more bills.  No </p><p>one can predict at present the public\'s appetite to roll-over </p><p>the debt at the April 8 auctions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Kaya said he heard from the bankers who met at </p><p>Treasury on March 26 that "Undersecretary Oztrak looks burned </p><p>out.  The rumor is his days are numbered.  The bankers told </p><p>Babacan that replacing Oztrak  would be extremely negative </p><p>for market confidence."  (Note:  Tuncay Ozilhan, Chairman of </p><p>TUSIAD which is the prestige Turkish business group, gave a </p><p>press statement March 26 reinforcing the point that now is </p><p>not the time to replace the reform-minded top civil servants. </p><p> Ozilhan also urged the GOT to move forward quickly with the </p><p>IMF and also to extend the current Stand-by Arrangement until </p><p>2006.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Treasury Concerned as Well, but </p><p>Still Negotiating LOI Terms </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Treasury Deputy U/S for public finance Hakan Ozyildiz </p><p>told us that, in Treasury\'s March 26 meeting with the </p><p>managers of the top four Turkish banks, the main message from </p><p>the banks was "finish the IMF Fourth Review immediately." </p><p>Ozyildiz said Treasury was pressing the IMF to sign the LOI </p><p>tomorrow, and to schedule a Fourth Review Board meeting </p><p>before the April 9 redemption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  IMF resrep told us there are still several issues to be </p><p>resolved  before the LOI can given to IMF senior management: </p><p>for instance, the GOT has not yet canceled the pending </p><p>investigations into BRSA\'s intervention of Pamukbank.  If the </p><p>issues were resolved overnight, IMF senior management could </p><p>begin reviewing the LOI tomorrow and the LOI could be signed </p><p>early next week. </p><p>--  On the April 8 auctions, Ozyildiz said the current plan </p><p>is to target a 85 percent roll-over of the April 9 redemption </p><p>(i.e. raise about TL 4 quadrillion or $2.35 billion).   His </p><p>conservative projection of Treasury\'s cash balance ahead of </p><p>the April 9 redemption is TL 1.8- 1.9 quadrillion.  If the </p><p>cash position is better than this projection (because tax </p><p>collection is stronger than projected) then the April 8 </p><p>borrowing needs would be somewhat less. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Ozyildiz said Treasury would work closely with the 10 </p><p>primary dealers in TL-denominated debt (9 Turkish banks and </p><p>HSBC) in offering appropriately short maturity debt on April </p><p>8.  He has scheduled meetings in Istanbul and conference </p><p>calls next week with these dealers. </p><p>Upheaval At the Privatization Administration: </p><p>Populist Fiddling </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The Prime Ministry announced March 26 that President </p><p>Sezer had approved a change in ministerial portfolios, </p><p>shifting the  Privatization Administration (PA) away from </p><p>Deputy PM Sener and into the portfolio of Finance Minister </p><p>Unakitan.  Last week, all three vice presidents at PA were </p><p>replaced by AK Party cadre. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) On March 26, Deputy PM Sener gave a farewell speech </p><p>on privatization asserting that the 2003 program was on track </p><p>(septel has a privatization update).  The markets, however, </p><p>focused on his remarks that, "the parliament is working on a </p><p>law to ensure nobody working in a state enterprise under the </p><p>PA portfolio will suffer from unemployment."  (Note: Sener </p><p>unveiled this draft law in January; if passed, it would </p><p>allow state enterprise workers to convert to the GOT civil </p><p>service rather than face a lay-off.  The World Bank believes </p><p>few state enterprise workers would opt for lower paying civil </p><p>service jobs, and would seek job severance packages instead. </p><p>However, this law\'s populist signal to the markets is quite </p><p>negative.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment:  According to rumors in the market, Sener </p><p>lost privatization because AK-associated businesses that had </p><p>earlier won some smaller privatization tenders had complained </p><p>to PM Erdogan that the PA was too aggressive in requiring </p><p>them to pay up.  Privatizations in Turkey are usually paid </p><p>for by installment (which means there are often payment </p><p>delays).  If true, this is another example of the AK </p><p>government focusing on the narrow interests of constituents </p><p>and missing the bigger picture of a malfunctioning </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  World Bank economist Parks gave us another example </p><p>of populist fiddling on March 27.  Industry Minister Ali </p><p>Coskun this week instructed the agricultural sales </p><p>cooperatives (part of his ministry) not to implement a </p><p>decision to close down several loss-making cotton spinning </p><p>mills owned by the cooperatives.  The World Bank requires </p><p>this decision under one of its adjustment loan programs </p><p>(Agricultural Sector Reform Loan).  Such decisions hold up </p><p>the cash flow to the Treasury at a time when cash reserves </p><p>are desperately needed. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
