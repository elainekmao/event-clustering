<p>UNCLAS KADUNA 1154 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS IN KADUNA </p><p> </p><p>1.  CEREMONIES MARKING NIGERIA\'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY </p><p>CELEBRATION AT KADUNA\'S MURTALA MOHAMMED SQUARE WERE </p><p>LOW-KEY AND ATTENDED BY A CROWD ESTIMATED BY THE PRESS </p><p>AT 20,000.  WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE IDEAL--PLEASANT </p><p>TEMPERATURES AND OVERCAST, BUT NONTHREATENING, SKIES. </p><p>HEADING THE LIST OF DIGNITARIES WERE A DELEGATION OF </p><p>TRADITIONAL CHIEFS, LED BY THE EMIRS OF ZARIA AND KATSINA, </p><p>AND HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICERS, INCLUDING AFRC MEMBER </p><p>AIR VICE MARSHAL MOHAMMED YAHAYA AND NDA COMMANDANT MAJOR </p><p>GENERAL PAUL TARFA.  ALSO IN ATTENDANCE WERE STATE </p><p>COMMISSIONERS, POLICE OFFICIALS, AND TOP MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>JUDICIARY.  DIGINITARIES, INCLUDING THE OFFICIAL HOST, </p><p>KADUNA GOVERNOR MAJOR ABUBAKAR UMAR, ARRIVED ON TIME AND </p><p>WITH LITTLE FANFARE.  THE CEREMONIES WENT OFF WITH NO </p><p>NOTABLE HITCHES AND WERE COMPLETED WELL AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, </p><p>ACTUALLY CLOSING AN HOUR EARLIER THAN ADVERTISED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE CROWD WAS GENERALLY WELL-BEHAVED AND NOT </p><p>PARTICULARLY ENTHUSIASTIC.  ONLY THE DESCENT OF THREE </p><p>PARACHUTISTS, THE OCCASIONAL BASHING OF PICKPOCKETS BY </p><p>POLICE, AND THE HIGHSTEPPING ANTICS OF EXUBERANT </p><p>YOUNGSTERS ON PARADE WERE ABLE TO GENERATE MUCH CROWD </p><p>INTEREST.  GOVERNOR UMAR\'S SPEECH, THE ONLY ONE ON THE </p><p>AGENDA, WAS BRIEF AND DELIVERED IN A STRONG, CLEAR VOICE. </p><p>THE SPEECH WAS A REPEAT OF PRESIDENGIDA\'S EARLIER </p><p>REMARKS BUT WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AS SUCH.  IT WAS GREETED BY </p><p>POLITE APPLAUSE FROM THE AUDIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  GOVERNOR UMAR HOSTED A LATE AFTERNOON GARDEN PARTY AT </p><p>GOVERNMENT HOUSE, DISTINGUISHED PRIMARILY BY THE CASUAL </p><p>NATURE OF THE GATHERING (NO SPEECHES) AND BY ITS BREVITY </p><p>(THE NIGERIAN ANTHEM WAS PLAYED AT 5:45 PM, SIGNALLING THE </p><p>END OF THE EVENT, FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE THE ALLOTTED HOUR </p><p>WAS UP).  THE GARDEN PARTY WAS WELL ATTENDED BY NOTABLES, </p><p>INCLUDING FOUR EMIRS, SENIOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS, AND SELECTED RETIRED OFFICIALS.  GOVERNOR UMAR </p><p>APPEARED CONFIDENT AND AT EASE IN HIS ROLE AS HOST. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT.  THE STREAMLINING OF THE CEREMONIES WAS THE </p><p>ONLY NOTABLE DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER SUCH OCCASIONS WE HAVE </p><p>SEEN HERE UNDER THE PREVIOUS REGIME.  CROWD SIZE AND THE </p><p>LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION BY NOTABLES WERE TYPICAL FOR EVENTS </p><p>OF THIS TYPE.  THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SPEECHES AND </p><p>THE LENGTH OF THE FESTIVITIES WAS A BLESSED RELIEF MUCH </p><p>APPRECIATED BY ALL, MOST ASSUREDLY INCLUDING THE CONSULAR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES IN ATTENDANCE.  THE EVENT WAS NOTABLE FOR </p><p>ITS LACK OF TRADITIONAL DANCERS AND SINGERS; MILITARY </p><p>DRILLS, MARCHING YOUTHS AND MARTIAL MUSIC PROVIDED THE </p><p>BULK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT.  THE USUAL DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>PRINTED VERSIONS OF MAJOR SPEECHES IN BOTH ENGLISH AND </p><p>HAUSA WAS ALSO DISCARDED.  THESE MINOR CHANGES PROBABLY </p><p>REFLECT EQUALLY THE NEW ADMINISTRATION\'S DEDICATION TO AN </p><p>AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND THE SHORT LEADTIME AVAILABLE TO </p><p>PREPARE FOR THIS YEAR\'S CELEBRATIONS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>LEE </p><p></p></div>
