<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 002565 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT:  KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, JUNE 8-11: NORMALIZATION </p><p>WITH ISRAEL; ROAD MAP PEACE PLAN; AMERICAN PRESENCE IN </p><p>REGION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: Comments early in the week by the State </p><p>Minister for Foreign Affairs that Kuwait supports </p><p>normalization of relations with Israel "within the framework </p><p>of a joint Arab position" unleashed a torrent of </p><p>denunciations from conservative and Islamist groups. Liberal </p><p>commentators see government back-tracking on the issue in a </p><p>statement by the Minister of Information (that "Kuwait would </p><p>be the last state to normalize relations" with Israel) and </p><p>characterize it as caving in to "Kuwait\'s terrorists and </p><p>backward citizens." </p><p> </p><p>The funeral of the first identified Kuwaiti POW returned </p><p>from Iraq was front-page news on June 11. Editor-in-chief </p><p>Mohammed Al-Jassim, charged earlier in the week with </p><p>"contesting the authority of the Amir," continues his public </p><p>calls for government reform. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: The lead story in all newspapers on June </p><p>11 was the burial in Kuwait of the remains of the first </p><p>positively identified Kuwaiti POW, Saad Al-Onaizi. The </p><p>funeral was attended by Minister of Interior, Sheikh </p><p>Mohammed Al-Khaled. </p><p> </p><p>On June 8, Al-Qabas reports that State Minister for Foreign </p><p>Affairs Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah said Kuwait supports </p><p>normalization with Israel within the framework of Saudi </p><p>Crown Prince Abdullah\'s initiative, prompting the </p><p>conservative Islamist Salafi Movement to reject any attempt </p><p>at normalization with "the Zionist entity" under any </p><p>circumstances. Al-Qabas also reports that Information </p><p>Minister Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahd stated that Kuwait would be </p><p>last country to normalize relations with the Hebrew State. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassa reports that families of 149 POWs plan a peaceful </p><p>demonstration in front of the National Committee for POWs </p><p>and Missing to object to being notified over the phone that </p><p>their children were killed in Iraq based a "non-authentic </p><p>document." </p><p> </p><p>Following his release on bail, editor-in-chief of Arabic </p><p>daily Al-Watan, Mohammed Al-Jassim, participated in an </p><p>electoral seminar on June 10, and called for a reevaluation </p><p>of the country\'s political process. Al-Watan reports that </p><p>"concerned Kuwaiti authorities" requested, "not one, but two </p><p>recordings from two individual tape recorders" for Al- </p><p>Jassim\'s statements during the seminar. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports a statement from the Director General of </p><p>Kuwait Customs that Kuwait had confiscated six Iraqi </p><p>historical artifacts that were in the possession of an </p><p>unnamed American citizen. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "What Will We Gain From Normalization?" </p><p>Ali Al-Ajmi wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (6/10): </p><p>"Arabs and Muslims consider Israel a dagger that has split </p><p>the Arab people. We only hope that Kuwait will not rush into </p><p>this step [of normalizing relations with Israel], which we </p><p>believe has not been properly studied and justified, that is </p><p>unless it was decided under external pressure. to comply </p><p>with the American polices in the region." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Normalization Is On The Way" </p><p>Liberal Political Science professor, Dr. Ahmad Al-Baghdadi </p><p>wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (6/11):  "Normalization is </p><p>inevitable. Kuwait will have to choose between Arab </p><p>extremist ideologies and American forces that will not </p><p>forgive Kuwait if it resists normalization. It is not </p><p>farfetched to think that [Kuwaiti] religious groups may </p><p>demand from the government public funds or special projects </p><p>in return for their support for normalization. The Arab </p><p>world supports normalization with Israel, and each Arab </p><p>government will act according to its interests. The Arab </p><p>Street may reject normalization, but it is powerless." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "When The Government Is Frightened" </p><p>Liberal Abdul-Latif Al-Duaij wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(6/09):  "Kuwait\'s Minister of Information, Sheikh Ahmed Al- </p><p>Fahd, described the Israeli government as a `Sharonian </p><p>terrorist\' state. This description was. a desperate attempt </p><p>to absorb the anger caused by the statements made by </p><p>Kuwait\'s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Dr. </p><p>Mohammad Al-Sabah, welcoming normalization with Israel. </p><p>Kuwait\'s terrorists and backward citizens objected [to </p><p>Sheikh Dr. Mohammad\'s statement] and the agents of the </p><p>Taliban and Bin Laden\'s cells were angered, thus the </p><p>Minister of Information issued assurances that there would </p><p>be no normalization. It seems our government has formed an </p><p>alliance with backward religious forces as it vindicates-- </p><p>through its own Minister of Information-- Hamas, [Islamic] </p><p>Jihad and other terrorist groups [in their actions] against </p><p>Abbas\'s government and the ideology of peace." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Restrictions of the New Occupier" </p><p>Conservative Dr. Sami Khalifa wrote in independent Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam (6/9):  "The American Administration has entered the </p><p>Middle East region by forcing Arab regimes to recognize the </p><p>existence of the Zionist entity under the pretext of </p><p>proposing what is called the `Road Map\'. [T]he US is </p><p>insisting on remaining in Iraq as an occupying force in </p><p>order to rearrange the regional situation to serve its </p><p>economic and political avidity, and to maintain its military </p><p>bases to eventually control Arab and Muslim resources." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Reformation of the Arab Mentality" </p><p>Nasser Al-Otaibi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (6/9): </p><p>"With the fall of the Iraqi regime and the Baath party, a </p><p>new era has begun. We must reevaluate our Arab mentality in </p><p>an effort to built defenses against any tyrants or </p><p>oppressive rulers. We must also. abide by humanitarian and </p><p>international principles in addition to denouncing all </p><p>terrorist acts and all oppressive ideologies. This will help </p><p>the Arab nation present itself as a responsible nation. </p><p>capable of undertaking a positive role in society." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
