END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Court Ruling on Prabhakaran </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In a widely publicized October 31 ruling, a Sri </p><p>Lanka trial court has convicted Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leader V. Prabhakaran in absentia of </p><p>planning a 1996 terrorist attack.  The trial court judge </p><p>sentenced Prabhakaran to 200 years in prison and a </p><p>warrant was issued for his arrest.  Three other low- </p><p>level LTTE operatives were found guilty and given hefty </p><p>sentences.  Two of these three are currently in custody, </p><p>while the other is believed to be "absconding" in LTTE- </p><p>controlled areas.  Pottu Aman, the LTTE intelligence </p><p>chief, and three others were acquitted.  This is </p><p>believed to be the first time that Prabhakaran has been </p><p>convicted by a Sri Lankan court.  (Note:  Along with </p><p>other LTTE officials, Prabhakaran remains under </p><p>indictment in India for the May 1991 murder of Rajiv </p><p>Gandhi.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The case involved the January 31, 1996 bombing </p><p>of the Central Bank building in downtown Colombo which </p><p>killed 78 people.  This attack was one of the most </p><p>brutal LTTE terrorist attacks in Colombo.  (Note:  As is </p><p>its pattern, the LTTE did not accept responsibility for </p><p>the blast, but the incident had all the hallmarks of a </p><p>LTTE attack and evidence eventually linked LTTE </p><p>operatives to the crime.)  Indictments of Prabhakaran </p><p>and his LTTE associates were handed down in 1996. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Against the backdrop of the peace process, it is </p><p>not clear why the trial court judge ruled on the case at </p><p>this time.  Desmond Fernando, a well-known lawyer, told </p><p>us that the case has been "meandering through the </p><p>judicial process for years."  Fernando speculated that </p><p>the judge who made the ruling, Sarath Ambepitiya, might </p><p>be against the peace process and trying to undermine it, </p><p>but he was not sure.  "It would have been easy for the </p><p>judge to postpone his ruling in any case," Fernando </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>GSL:  No Impact on Peace Process </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The government was quick to announce that the </p><p>ruling would have no impact on the peace process. </p><p>Speaking in Thailand where he is participating in the </p><p>second round of peace talks with the LTTE (see Para 7), </p><p>G.L. Peiris, the Minister of Constitutional Affairs </p><p>(among other portfolios), said he could not discuss the </p><p>merits of the ruling itself.  Peiris added, however, </p><p>that he was "of the firm view that the court\'s decision </p><p>would have no effect on the peace process." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) For its part, the LTTE did not have an immediate </p><p>response to the verdict.  Gajendran Ponnambalam, a Tamil </p><p>National Alliance MP, told us that the LTTE might be </p><p>"annoyed" by the ruling, but he did not think the group </p><p>would opt out of the peace process over the issue. </p><p>Ponnambalam noted that the court decision may have </p><p>provoked some levity in the jungle bastions of the LTTE, </p><p>with some in the group thinking "if that is how the </p><p>court feels then by all means try and come to arrest </p><p>us!" </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Talks seem off to Positive Start </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The announcement came on the same day </p><p>(October 31) as GSL and LTTE negotiators sat down to </p><p>begin their second round of talks in Thailand (see </p><p>Reftels).  Based on initial soundings, the talks seem to </p><p>have gotten off to a positive start.  G.L. Peiris said </p><p>the talks had been held in a "cordial and constructive" </p><p>atmosphere.  According to press reports, the major focus </p><p>of the first day was ways to ease tensions between the </p><p>Tigers and the Muslim community in the east. </p><p>Ponnambalam said he had heard that the LTTE was </p><p>"satisfied" with how the first day went.  The talks are </p><p>set to continue until Sunday, November 3, when they wrap </p><p>up with a late afternoon press conference. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The ruling has little practical effect inasmuch </p><p>as Prabhakaran -- surrounded by 15-20,000 armed and </p><p>rabid supporters in jungle hideouts -- does not appear </p><p>to be a likely candidate for arrest.  That said, there </p><p>is little doubt that the judgment complicates matters </p><p>for the government in the long run.  The ruling, for </p><p>example, makes it even more difficult for the GSL to </p><p>deal directly with Prabhakaran in the course of the </p><p>peace process if it needed to -- and the LTTE leader </p><p>already verges on the radioactive because of his many </p><p>crimes.  There are probably legal ways that the </p><p>government could act to quash the verdict or obviate it, </p><p>but these might provoke domestic opposition.  The </p><p>government, thus, could be put in a fix if/when the time </p><p>comes that it needs Prabhakaran\'s imprimatur to seal </p><p>some sort of peace deal.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
