<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000248 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PINR, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR WEIGHS IN WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL DE LEON </p><p>ON GERARDI AND CHOCON CASES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 231 </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 207 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador John R. Hamilton, for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Ambassador phoned Attorney General Carlos </p><p>de Leon on January 29 to enlist his immediate action on the </p><p>investigation of a recent Gerardi witness murder (Ref A) and </p><p>the protection of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights, </p><p>Tatiana Morales, who has been receiving threats coincidental </p><p>to her involvement in the Chocon case, which is set to go to </p><p>trial on January 30.  De Leon responded that he was </p><p>initiating an investigation into the murder and doing the </p><p>best he could to protect Morales.  The Ambassador thanked him </p><p>for his efforts and for his work on the case involving two </p><p>Peace Corps Volunteers (Ref B).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador phoned Attorney General Carlos de Leon </p><p>on January 29 to express concern over the murder of Noe Gomez </p><p>Limon, the brother of a key witness in the high-profile </p><p>murder case of Guatemalan Archbishop Gerardi.  The Ambassador </p><p>noted that human rights and press sources tell us that the </p><p>Public Ministry has yet to open an investigation into his </p><p>murder.  The Ambassador said that he hoped these sources were </p><p>mistaken, but suggested the need for the Public Ministry to </p><p>investigate the murder both vigorously and publicly.  De Leon </p><p>responded that the Public Ministry was indeed investigating </p><p>the murder, but agreed that they should do so more publicly. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador noted as well that Tatiana Morales, the </p><p>Special Prosecutor for Human Rights Cases, has been receiving </p><p>threats because of her involvement in the Chocon case, which </p><p>is set to go to trial on January 30 in the High Impact Court </p><p>of Chiquimula.  (NOTE: This is the trial of 16 former </p><p>anti-narcotics police who killed two civilians and sought to </p><p>cover it up.)  The Ambassador noted that Morales is </p><p>reportedly unable to communicate effectively from Chiquimula </p><p>with her office and asked that that situation be fixed. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) De Leon said he was on top of the situation, that he </p><p>was providing Morales with an armored vehicle and follow car </p><p>with armed guards for the time she is in Chiquimula, and that </p><p>the National Civilian Police are providing 50 policemen for </p><p>courtroom security and order.  De Leon has just met with the </p><p>President of the Supreme Court, who was concerned about </p><p>threats to one of the three judges in the case.  The judge </p><p>was considering withdrawing from the case.  De Leon (and the </p><p>Supreme Court President, who phoned for the Ambassador later </p><p>on the same subject) said the judge wanted to move his son </p><p>and other immediate family members to the US to be with </p><p>relatives, temporarily.  The Ambassador arranged with the </p><p>Consular Section to assure expeditious consideration of their </p><p>visas. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador also expressed appreciation to De Leon </p><p>for the support (which has, with RSO prodding, been good) the </p><p>Public Ministry has given in the investigation of the assault </p><p>on two Peace Corps Volunteers. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
