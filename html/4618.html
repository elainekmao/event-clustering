Summary: Continued Maoist violence in Nepal has taken a </p><p>severe toll on the country\'s children, both physically and </p><p>mentally.  More than 100 have been killed during the course </p><p>of the "People\'s War," and an estimated 1500 orphans and </p><p>15,000 displaced children face an uncertain future.  Death </p><p>or imprisonment of wage-earners, forced migration and the </p><p>breakdown of social services has brought many families to </p><p>the brink of starvation and forced young children to work </p><p>outside the home or survive on the street.  Throughout the </p><p>country, destruction of health posts and other village </p><p>facilities has deprived children of medical care and safe </p><p>drinking water.  There have been repeated reports of child </p><p>rape, torture, imprisonment and injury, and child welfare </p><p>workers anticipate that even after physical wounds have </p><p>healed, the psychological effects of the insurgency\'s </p><p>extreme violence will continue to have a disastrous </p><p>influence on the next generation of leaders.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>LARGE NUMBERS, SMALL VICTIMS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. As the world observed this year\'s International Child </p><p>Rights Day on November 20, a growing number of orphaned, </p><p>injured, displaced and terrorized children in Nepal had </p><p>little to celebrate.  According to estimates by human rights </p><p>NGOs, more than 1500 children have been orphaned in the </p><p>ongoing Maoist insurgency and more than 15,000 have been </p><p>displaced.  More than 100 children have died in </p><p>indiscriminate bombing attacks, have been brutally murdered </p><p>by one side or the other, or have been killed in the </p><p>crossfire between insurgents and security forces.  Most of </p><p>the children killed were aged 9 to 11. </p><p> </p><p>3. The number of children otherwise affected by the </p><p>insurgency is impossible to quantify, since the consequences </p><p>of the violence are varied and far-reaching.  Informal </p><p>Sector Service Center (INSEC), a local human rights group, </p><p>has estimated that 100,000 children have been affected by </p><p>the insurgency, and that 600,000 are "living in inhuman </p><p>conditions."  Other NGOs have refrained from citing a </p><p>figure. "All of the children in Nepal are affected," said </p><p>Gauri Pradhan, President of Child Workers in Nepal Concerned </p><p>Center (CWIN), "They\'re depressed, frustrated and scared. </p><p>They see the Maoists come to school time and again with </p><p>guns.  They see violence and bloodshed all around.  Even the </p><p>children in [relatively safe] Kathmandu watching the </p><p>television or reading the newspapers feel the insecurity." </p><p> </p><p>4. It\'s small wonder that children are living in a state of </p><p>tension and fear.  Kathmandu newspapers contain a daily </p><p>litany of violence, much of it against children, and much of </p><p>it random.  On November 8, a thirteen-year-old boy was </p><p>killed when a bomb exploded as he was walking past a garbage </p><p>dump, and another thirteen-year-old, accused of spying, was </p><p>hacked to death by Maoists.  On November 13, a fourteen-year- </p><p>old was killed and a ten-year-old boy was seriously injured </p><p>by a bomb as they walked along the highway. On November 14, </p><p>a nine-year-old boy was killed by a bomb planted near his </p><p>school. </p><p> </p><p>5. Children living in the conflict zones have seen their </p><p>parents, neighbors, friends, teachers and relatives killed </p><p>in brutal fashion.  Many have witnessed violent beatings and </p><p>sexual assaults, or have been victims themselves.  Though no </p><p>reliable statistics have been collected on the number of </p><p>children injured or assaulted in the conflict, CWIN has </p><p>documented several cases of sex abuse of young girls </p><p>involved with the Maoists, and the National Human Rights </p><p>Commission has reported as an "illustration" an incident in </p><p>which a young girl was gang-raped in front of her parents </p><p>after they paid only 60,000 Nrs (770 USD) of the 100,000 Nrs </p><p>(1280 USD) demanded by local insurgents. </p><p> </p><p>ORPHANS AND DISPLACED CHILDREN: </p><p>TRAUMATIC PAST, UNCERTAIN FUTURE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. Those children not injured or killed in the insurgency </p><p>face other numerous hardships.  Death of one or both parents </p><p>has lowered an already poor standard of living for many </p><p>children, and many have been forced to work outside the home </p><p>or to fend for themselves on the streets.  Government </p><p>benefits for affected children are insufficient or </p><p>nonexistent. In the case of army or police children, the </p><p>services provide widows with one-time payments of up to </p><p>150,000 Nepali rupees (approx. 1900 USD), but most police </p><p>widows have reported problems in receiving the benefits, </p><p>especially in remote areas of the country. </p><p> </p><p>7. The situation is worse for orphans whose parents were </p><p>either suspected Maoists or simply innocent victims of </p><p>random violence.  CWIN\'s Pradhan said that under the last </p><p>government, some families of civilian victims were able to </p><p>obtain some compensation, but only if they belonged to the </p><p>then-ruling Nepali Congress party and only if they had </p><p>direct access to high-level officials in order to press </p><p>their claims.  Each district has a Child Welfare Committee, </p><p>but the offices rarely have any funds these days.  Some </p><p>Chief District Officers have responded by collecting </p><p>donations from passport applicants, assuming that anyone </p><p>wealthy enough to travel abroad can spare some rupees for </p><p>the district orphans.  In most places, however, the children </p><p>are left to fend for themselves. "If someone cares, that\'s </p><p>nice," INSEC\'s Pyakurel stated with a resigned shrug.  "But </p><p>if not, [the orphans] become street children." </p><p> </p><p>8. The number of homeless children and families is rising as </p><p>migration to the perceived safety of Kathmandu or district </p><p>headquarters increases and thousands of children leave their </p><p>homes or families. In three surveyed districts, migration to </p><p>the capital cities has doubled in the last two years.  In </p><p>Bardiya District more than 250 families of security </p><p>personnel have been compelled to leave their homes due to </p><p>Maoist threats, and similar tales have been reported in </p><p>other areas of the country.  In addition to the emotional </p><p>trauma of displacement, the children face serious problems </p><p>meeting their basic needs.  Most displaced families were </p><p>forced to leave behind the year\'s rice harvest, and many who </p><p>have no friends or relatives to provide shelter are unable </p><p>to afford nightly rates at town hotels.  "We generally never </p><p>had street families in Nepal," said CWIN\'s Gauri Pradhan, </p><p>"but you can see them in all the towns now.  It\'s definitely </p><p>on the rise." </p><p> </p><p>9. Increasing numbers of children are also being sent away </p><p>from home by their parents to protect them from threatened </p><p>abduction and forced recruitment by the Maoists.  More than </p><p>200 young people in Sarlahi, Surkhet and Ilam have </p><p>reportedly left their villages and settled in town centers </p><p>after Maoists began visiting local families and demanding </p><p>that parents deliver either monthly cash payments or their </p><p>children. According to CWIN, reports that the Maoists will </p><p>come to take one child per household, usually between the </p><p>ages of fourteen and eighteen, are prevalent in most </p><p>districts.  Abductions of up to 170 children have been </p><p>documented, lending credence to the claims.  Villages have </p><p>reported losing up to 95 percent of their population between </p><p>the ages of 14 and 40 as a result of such rumors.  Embassy </p><p>officers, including the Ambassador, have interviewed a </p><p>number of children who reported their forced abduction by </p><p>the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>10. Unfortunately, the displaced children\'s situation can go </p><p>from bad to worse, as they are often sent to live with </p><p>relatives who can ill-afford to keep or to feed them.  Many </p><p>end up working as child laborers and all are vulnerable to a </p><p>range of abuses.  Many find their way to India for </p><p>employment, or are sent there by their parents or relatives. </p><p>CWIN and other NGOs have documented an increase in the </p><p>number of child workers in towns that have experienced large </p><p>influxes of displaced persons.  One study in southern Siraha </p><p>district revealed that children are the major full-time </p><p>workforce in brick factories, cigarette factories, </p><p>restaurants and hotels along the highway; and that the </p><p>number of child domestic servants is increasing in several </p><p>neighboring districts as well.  NGOs also report that </p><p>trafficking and sex abuse of children are on the rise in </p><p>affected areas. </p><p> </p><p>CHILD INFORMANTS: CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. Children in the conflict zones often are caught between </p><p>the Maoists and security forces, and, on occasion, are used </p><p>as informants by both sides.  In one incident in </p><p>northeastern Dolakha district, Maoists rounded up 200 </p><p>children--the entire population of a primary school--at the </p><p>beginning of the day, marched them to an unknown location in </p><p>the jungle, and questioned them about the movement of </p><p>security forces.  The army had previously used the school </p><p>building as a barracks.  Though the children were all </p><p>released by evening, they and their parents were terrified. </p><p> </p><p>12. NGOs state that children who have left the Maoists and </p><p>reported to "surrender camps" run by the army have been </p><p>forced to return repeatedly to their villages to identify </p><p>former comrades or to their units to report on movements, </p><p>placing them in danger of retaliation by the insurgents. </p><p>NGOs report that children have been beaten by military and </p><p>police personnel during interrogation. </p><p> </p><p>LONG-TERM PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. Child advocates agree that the psychological effects of </p><p>the insurgency, while not yet fully assessed, are severe. </p><p>"The violence they witness has resulted in thousands of </p><p>children being psychologically traumatized," said CWIN\'s </p><p>Pradhan. "They are becoming negative, erratic and more </p><p>inhuman.  They seem to be losing the ability to judge </p><p>between right and wrong." </p><p> </p><p>14. INSEC\'s Pyakurel agreed with the assessment.  "The </p><p>behavior of children is changing in the rural areas," he </p><p>said upon his return from a trip to Maoist-affected areas. </p><p>"When we met children, they asked for guns.  When I asked </p><p>why they wanted the guns, some said they wanted to kill the </p><p>Maoists and some said they wanted to kill the police.  They </p><p>were all motivated by revenge." </p><p> </p><p>15. Child welfare workers have reported that children who </p><p>used to be frightened by the sight of dead bodies or wounded </p><p>people seem to no longer notice them.  Interviewed children </p><p>readily admit that they live in constant fear, and most can </p><p>cite examples of torture and killing in their villages. </p><p>Most children cannot articulate plans or aspirations for the </p><p>future, and the few interviewed children who could identify </p><p>an ambition universally chose careers related to the </p><p>insurgency--the police or army. </p><p> </p><p>16. NGOs are concerned that exposure to the conflict has </p><p>made violence a tolerable option for children, and that they </p><p>are beginning to see it as the preferable or only way to </p><p>solve problems.  "The ongoing conflict has paved the way for </p><p>a violent culture in the psyche of children," warned </p><p>Pradhan. "If we are unable to rescue the children from </p><p>violence, the new generation will be even more violent." </p><p> </p><p>HEALTH ALSO AFFECTED </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. Less direct effects of the insurgency will also continue </p><p>to be felt long into the future.  In many places, drinking </p><p>water systems, health posts, public communication and </p><p>service centers have been destroyed.  Nutrition programs </p><p>have been cancelled as a result of security concerns, </p><p>depriving some children of their only certain meal. </p><p>Government healthcare workers have been threatened, attacked </p><p>and abducted in Maoist-affected areas, and most are </p><p>reluctant to return to carry out biannual immunization </p><p>programs.  USAID-supplied vitamin A capsules, vital for </p><p>assisting in the development of childhood immune systems, </p><p>have gone undistributed in villages in many districts. </p><p>Polio, which was declared eradicated in 2000, has resurfaced </p><p>in isolated cases. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY FORCES ADD TO TENSION </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. It is important to note that children have been </p><p>victimized by both sides of the conflict.  The Maoist </p><p>insurgents routinely abuse the rights and neutrality of </p><p>children through terrorism and intimidation.  Government </p><p>forces also appear guilty for abusing children.  Statistics </p><p>compiled by INSEC indicate that 63 of the 110 confirmed </p><p>killings of minors were carried out by security forces. </p><p>Though some of those killed were very likely child </p><p>combatants fighting for the insurgency, children interviewed </p><p>by NGOs have related incidents of torture, imprisonment and </p><p>terrorism at the hands of security forces.  The number of </p><p>children killed or victimized by the Maoists, of course, is </p><p>much harder to quantify. </p><p> </p><p>19. According to one NGO study, fourteen-year-old Madhav </p><p>Chaugali was regularly beaten by police trying to find his </p><p>father, a suspected Maoist.  In Bajani, in Kailali district, </p><p>villagers report that three students were arrested by the </p><p>army.  Though two were returned two months later, the family </p><p>of the third has had no word of her welfare or whereabouts. </p><p>Also in Bajani, villagers related an incident in which </p><p>police killed eight members of one family who had a Maoist </p><p>hiding in their home.  The children of the family were </p><p>spared, but orphaned. </p><p> </p><p>20. Several villages have reported that security forces </p><p>harass children above age fourteen, demanding to be told who </p><p>and where the Maoists are.  The same villages also report </p><p>that the security forces sometimes have physically abused </p><p>children as a tool of interrogation.  In Fulbari, Kailali </p><p>district, the army reportedly gathered the entire village in </p><p>one place, including children older than fifteen, and </p><p>threatened to kill them all if they would not provide </p><p>information about the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE BY HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21. Kathmandu-based NGOs have been calling for the </p><p>government and human rights organizations to work together </p><p>to protect children\'s rights and to assist children affected </p><p>by the violence.  The task is overwhelming.  NGO </p><p>rehabilitation centers for children--intended to assist </p><p>trafficking victims or child laborers--have been overloaded </p><p>by victims of the insurgency.  CWIN\'s drop-in centers, </p><p>transit centers, help lines and outreach programs are </p><p>operating at full capacity in Kathmandu.  According to </p><p>Pradhan, however, the 300 children living in CWIN\'s </p><p>rehabilitation homes  are "barely scratching the surface of </p><p>the problem." </p><p> </p><p>22. INSEC\'s Pyakurel says that his organization\'s programs </p><p>in rural areas cannot keep up with demand for health </p><p>services and building programs and that his workers have </p><p>been urging the Maoists not to attack school buildings and </p><p>public facilities.  Other NGOs are just now developing </p><p>programs to assist orphans in cities outside Kathmandu. </p><p> </p><p>23. Though activists are optimistic that assistance programs </p><p>can alleviate some of the immediate suffering of children </p><p>caught up in the conflict, the longer view is more ominous. </p><p>"Children are supposed to be regarded as a source of hope </p><p>and inspiration," CWIN President Pradhan lamented. "But with </p><p>all of the problems they\'re growing up with, and the effect </p><p>on their development... It\'s depressing instead." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>24. Despite the grievous impact of the insurgency on the </p><p>children of Nepal, few political parties--or foreign </p><p>governments besides the US and UK--are speaking out on what </p><p>should be an issue of universal condemnation.  Aside from </p><p>the terrible details of individual stories, leaders\' </p><p>attention should be captured by the fact that effects of the </p><p>ongoing insurgency will be felt by the current generation of </p><p>children long into their adulthood. As today\'s children </p><p>grown into tomorrow\'s leaders, the fear and insecurity of </p><p>the insurgency may well determine the nation\'s ability to </p><p>craft a lasting peace.  Education of many children has been </p><p>interrupted, perhaps terminally (septel). Rebuilding the </p><p>schools and public facilities destroyed by the Maoists will </p><p>take years, and will cost the Government of Nepal millions </p><p>of rupees.  Rebuilding the shattered psychological state of </p><p>Nepali children is a task without a clear end, but one that </p><p>is vital if the next generation of leadership is going to </p><p>have a chance at governing justly, and of leaving behind the </p><p>motivation of revenge. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
