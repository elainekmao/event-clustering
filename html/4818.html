<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 009073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: PRESIDENT\'S VETO CLOUDS ERDOGAN\'S </p><p>POLITICAL FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 8165 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 8252 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. Kass. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: President Sezer Dec. 19 vetoed a </p><p>constitutional amendment package (including changes to </p><p>Articles 67, 76, and 78 -- ref A) designed to reinstate AK </p><p>Leader Erdogan\'s political rights and clear the way for his </p><p>entry into Parliament and the Government. Contacts across the </p><p>spectrum say that Sezer is playing politics, risking not only </p><p>his reputation for even-handedness but complicating </p><p>government operations at a time when clarity and decisive </p><p>action are needed.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>What Happened: the Politics </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Sezer claimed the constitution "could not be changed </p><p>for one man."  For his part, Erdogan publicly challenged the </p><p>President to submit the amendments -- and by implication, </p><p>Sezer\'s political reputation -- to a popular referendum.  His </p><p>lawyer charged that, while the constitutional amendment </p><p>package "is not personal, Sezer\'s veto is." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The package had passed Parliamentary muster Dec. 13 </p><p>with 440 of 465 votes cast, including a minimum of some 80 </p><p>from the Establishmentarian, opposition Republican People\'s </p><p>Party (CHP).  This sizable figure represents nearly 45 </p><p>percent of the entire CHP caucus.  Deniz Baykal, the CHP </p><p>leader, reportedly had been anxious to bring the popular </p><p>Erdogan into Parliament and Government, partly to make AK an </p><p>easier target by saddling Erdogan -- rather than P.M. </p><p>Abdullah Gul, AK\'s No. 2 man -- directly with any AK </p><p>Government missteps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Contacts across the political spectrum are questioning </p><p>the President\'s motives, criticizing his action as a purely </p><p>political vice legal decision -- by a man who promotes a </p><p>reputation as a disinterested, "by the book" former </p><p>Constitutional Court Chief. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHP has publicly indicated that it disagrees with Sezer\'s </p><p>reasoning.  Nevertheless, senior CHP deputy Bulent Tanla told </p><p>poloff Dec. 20 that the party will now "carefully review" </p><p>Sezer\'s ruling.  "With all of the important issues on </p><p>Turkey\'s agenda, it would be wrong to hurry through the </p><p>process," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Senior AK officials are even more direct, asserting to us </p><p>that by vetoing the package Sezer "is serving the political </p><p>interests of Turkey\'s Deep State" (ref B).  The Parliamentary </p><p>Bureau Chief of the semi-official Anatolian News Agency </p><p>(A.A.) volunteered that behind Sezer stands a collection of </p><p>State bureaucratic and other institutions intent on keeping </p><p>the heat on Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The owner/CEO of a TV-newspaper conglomerate told </p><p>D/Polcouns Dec. 20 that Sezer is working with elements of the </p><p>military, the judiciary, and with CHP to promote discord in </p><p>government operations -- suggesting that despite CHP\'s </p><p>earlier support for the package, it wants to keep AK twisting </p><p>in the wind.  He asserted that TGS Chief Gen. Hilmi Ozkok </p><p>personally wants to stay out of the fray and is even trying </p><p>to limit military meddling in politics, but faces resistance </p><p>from senior commanders who take a different tack.  (Note: </p><p>Some general officers are pleasantly surprised by AK and do </p><p>not, in fact, want it undercut -- yet.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>The Mechanics </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The draft must now pass through Parliament as though </p><p>it were a new proposal -- beginning with deliberations in the </p><p>Constitutional Committee before moving a floor vote by the </p><p>entire Assembly.  As it did the first time around, Parliament </p><p>will then vote on he amendments twice -- with a 48-hour </p><p>interval between votes.  As a result, the earliest Parliament </p><p>can adopt the legislation for Sezer\'s review would be Dec. </p><p>27, according to the mainstream press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The AK-controlled Parliament is likely to try pushing </p><p>through and resubmitting to Sezer an unchanged package.  If </p><p>so, Sezer would have three options: 1) he can accept the </p><p>package, having made public his concerns; 2) he can apply to </p><p>the Constitutional Court for an annulment of the changes; or </p><p>3) he may submit all or part of the package to referendum. </p><p>For most pieces of legislation, the president has at most 15 </p><p>days to reach a decision.  For changes to the constitution, </p><p>however, there is no formal time limit, but Sezer would be </p><p>expected to produce a decision by mid-January (assuming </p><p>late-December legislative passage).  Should Sezer decide to </p><p>take the matter to the voters, the action shifts to the </p><p>Supreme Election Board (YSK), which is charged with </p><p>establishing the conditions and calendar under which the </p><p>referendum would be held.  In this regard, the YSK apparently </p><p>has considerable lattitude. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Comment: Playing Chicken </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Our AK sources and other contacts say Erdogan\'s level </p><p>of irritation with Sezer is high and growing.  This, together </p><p>with what we know about AK and Erdogan\'s personality, suggest </p><p>that at a minimum, tension between the AK Party/Government </p><p>and Sezer will smolder, and could flare up when Erdogan </p><p>assumes formal power -- which contacts of all political </p><p>stripes assume is a virtual certainty sooner or later. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In contrast to his most recent predecessors, Sezer has </p><p>tried to nurture a reputation as an apolitical Head of State. </p><p> Nevertheless, over time he has let his political slip show </p><p>in ever increasing increments; for example a senior </p><p>Constitutional Court Justice charges that Sezer has in fact </p><p>abandoned neutrality in favor of supporting a narrow </p><p>Establishmentarian, status-quo-oriented political agenda. </p><p>While a referendum would entail risks on all sides, Sezer -- </p><p>and a Presidency whose powers depend more on public approval </p><p>than on specific constitutional provisions -- would stand to </p><p>lose the most by: 1) appearing to thwart the popular will; </p><p>and 2) perpetuating the current, unwieldy situation regarding </p><p>Erdogan, AK, and the Government -- created in the first </p><p>instance by legal restrictions on the AK leader that appear </p><p>increasingly without merit in the public eye. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
