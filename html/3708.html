<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002087 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIONWIDE LOCAL ELECTIONS A DEMOCRATIC CHARADE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Action request -- see para 10. </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Nationwide rural council elections are scheduled for </p><p>September 28-29, and the Government of Zimbabwe has used all </p><p>the means at its disposal to block genuine competition from </p><p>the opposition MDC.  Aspiring MDC candidates have been </p><p>arrested on frivolous charges, assaulted, forced to flee </p><p>their residences, and subjected to unfair nomination </p><p>requirements.  As a result, the MDC has been able to field </p><p>only 646 candidates for more than 1400 contested seats.  The </p><p>MDC is seeking a judicial order to delay the elections, </p><p>citing the widespread physical abuse and procedural </p><p>manipulation.  The government has used every trick in the </p><p>book to block nomination of MDC candidates, while claiming in </p><p>its media mouthpieces that the MDC\'s failure to nominate </p><p>candidates is evidence of the party\'s declining popularity. </p><p>This outrageous process has descended to the level of low </p><p>farce, and the Department may wish to consider issuing a </p><p>statement critical of the Government\'s ongoing efforts to </p><p>subvert democracy so brazenly.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Local council elections -- when, what, and where </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Elections for 1438 rural council seats nationwide </p><p>will be held September 28-29.  Rural councils do not have a </p><p>great deal of authority in Zimbabwe\'s centralized system of </p><p>governance.  They do collect some funds via assessment of </p><p>"development levies" and manage small amounts of resources at </p><p>the local level.  The primary significance of the elections, </p><p>however, is the political message that will be sent by the </p><p>outcome.  The ruling party is determined to demonstrate that </p><p>it continues to have rural areas locked down.  For its part, </p><p>the MDC will want to show some penetration of ZANU-PF\'s </p><p>traditional geographic stronghold. </p><p> </p><p>Violence and harrassment </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) According to a September 3 press statement issued by </p><p>MDC Elections Director Paul Themba-Nyathi, more than 20 </p><p>aspiring MDC councillors have been "assaulted, harassed, and </p><p>tortured" in the run-up to the council elections.  In one </p><p>incident, the party\'s deputy organizing secretary for </p><p>Midlands South, Anthony Chamahwinya, was hospitalized after a </p><p>severe beating at the hands of ZANU-PF supporters on </p><p>September 1.  At the time of the attack, Chamahwinya </p><p>reportedly was distributing nomination papers for his party\'s </p><p>prospective candidates.  An MDC candidate in Mount Darwin </p><p>south, in Mashonaland Central province, was abducted by </p><p>alleged members of ZANU-PF\'s youth militia and has not been </p><p>seen since.  Some candidates have withdrawn from the race in </p><p>the face of such intimidation, understandably fearing for </p><p>their lives.  36 candidates in Midlands South have pulled </p><p>out, while 10 have abandoned races in Masvingo province.  In </p><p>addition, according to Themba-Nyathi, more than 70 MDC </p><p>candidates and key party officials involved in the campaign </p><p>have been arrested on trumped-up charges, mostly in </p><p>Manicaland and Mashonaland Central provinces.  An unspecified </p><p>number of candidates and party officials have been forced to </p><p>flee their homes, while those who have braved the threats of </p><p>violence are finding it difficult, if not impossible, to </p><p>campaign openly.  According to press reports, 63 MDC </p><p>candidates in Manicaland have withdrawn from the race, citing </p><p>assaults and intimidation. </p><p> </p><p>Nomination skulduggery </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Election officials have also erected significant </p><p>obstacles in the candidate registration process itself. </p><p>Large numbers of MDC candidates have been disqualified on </p><p>frivolous grounds, after they failed to present supporting </p><p>documentation not required by Zimbabwean law.  (The "Rural </p><p>District Councils Act" requires only that candidates prove </p><p>they are Zimbabwean citizens, registered voters, and </p><p>residents of the ward in which they are running.)  The most </p><p>common tactic was to demand presentation of long birth </p><p>certificates on September 5, the national day of nomination. </p><p>Most Zimbabweans have a short-form birth certificate, and it </p><p>takes several weeks to coax the longer, more detailed version </p><p>out of the Registrar-General\'s office.  ZANU-PF candidates </p><p>either were given adequate advance notice of this requirement </p><p>or were not asked to comply.  In other cases, election </p><p>officials demanded proof of tax payments, while access to the </p><p>nomination court was blocked by war veterans and ZANU-PF </p><p>supporters in several other instances.  Many nomination </p><p>centers were moved from government offices to police </p><p>stations, an effective intimidatory tactic given the role of </p><p>the police in suppressing MDC supporters.  (Comment:  As the </p><p>economy continues to decline and ZANU-PF\'s popularity erodes, </p><p>the ruling party might use this tactic in future elections, </p><p>simply manufacturing reasons to prevent the placement of MDC </p><p>candidates on the ballot.  End Comment.) </p><p>Government spin </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The ruling party\'s comprehensive "campaign" efforts </p><p>have succeeded in ensuring that the MDC has been able to </p><p>field candidates for only 646 seats, less than half the </p><p>number being contested.  The Government-controlled media </p><p>have, without any apparent sense of shame, heralded this </p><p>development as a sign of the MDC\'s imminent demise. </p><p> </p><p>To boycott or not to boycott </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Some observers have urged the MDC to boycott the </p><p>election, contending that the party\'s participation merely </p><p>lends legitimacy to a deeply flawed process.  The entire </p><p>party leadership, however, appears determined to go forward, </p><p>no matter how flawed the process.  MDC Secretary-General </p><p>Welshman Ncube told us the national executive had discussed </p><p>the possibility of a boycott, but had decided in the end that </p><p>the party owed it to those supporters and candidates who have </p><p>put their lives on the line to participate.  The party\'s </p><p>national elections coordinator insisted to us that a boycott </p><p>was never seriously considered, and that participating </p><p>demonstrates the party\'s commitment to achieving change </p><p>through democratic means.   Political analyst John Makumbe </p><p>said he had advised the MDC not to waste too much time and </p><p>resources campaigning, but that contesting was important </p><p>because the party had to "keep the fire burning."   David </p><p>Coltart, a Member of Parliament and the MDC\'s Shadow Justice </p><p>Minister, told us that the party is seeking a delay of the </p><p>elections in the High Court, citing the array of </p><p>irregularities to date, but he was not optimistic of a </p><p>favorable ruling. </p><p> </p><p>Plans for Observation </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN), a </p><p>coalition of NGOs committed to guaranteeing the integrity of </p><p>elections, plans to deploy observers for the rural council </p><p>elections.  It has applied to the GOZ-appointed Electoral </p><p>Supervisory Commission for accreditation of 5,000 observers, </p><p>but expects to receive approval for only half that number, </p><p>and at the very last minute.  Asked where he would recommend </p><p>the Embassy send observers, ZESN Chairman Reginald </p><p>Matchaba-Hove suggested Matabeleland, Manicaland, and </p><p>Midlands, saying those provinces were the only ones in which </p><p>the MDC had been able to field significant numbers of </p><p>candidates. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) These elections are little more than a charade, as </p><p>the ruling party has used almost every trick in the book to </p><p>tilt the process overwhelmingly in its favor.  (The GOZ has </p><p>clearly come to the conclusion that giving voters a choice </p><p>when food supplies are dwindling might not produce a pleasing </p><p>result.)  For that reason, we have no plans to mount a </p><p>significant in-house observation effort, but likely will send </p><p>several Embassy officers to cover constituencies that appear </p><p>to be up-for-grabs.  We agree that the MDC ought to </p><p>participate where it can, so that it continues to be </p><p>perceived as a credible democratic alternative to an </p><p>increasingly unpopular regime and because it stands the </p><p>chance of picking up some seats in rural areas, particularly </p><p>the MDC\'s stronghold of Matabeleland.  The MDC can portray </p><p>any inroads it makes into rural areas, no matter how small, </p><p>as evidence of expanding popular appeal. </p><p> </p><p>Action request </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Preparations for the rural council elections have </p><p>gotten virtually no coverage from the international media, </p><p>and the GOZ has taken advantage of this lack of scrutiny to </p><p>make a mockery of the democratic process.  Shining the </p><p>international spotlight on the violence and irregularities </p><p>associated with the local elections could restrain some of </p><p>the worst excesses by GOZ supporters and give cover to voters </p><p>inclined to cast ballots for the MDC but who are currently </p><p>scared to do so.  We recommend the Department: </p><p> </p><p>--consider issuing a public statement now expressing serious </p><p>concern about the violence, intimidation, and range of </p><p>irregularities witnessed to date, and urging the GOZ to </p><p>facilitate the registration of all interested candidates.  We </p><p>might want to tie a refusal to address our concerns to </p><p>expansion of targeted sanctions, such as an announcement of </p><p>asset seizure; </p><p> </p><p>--encourage regional governments to weigh in with the GOZ, </p><p>stressing the importance of holding an election that is </p><p>consistent with the SADC norms and standards; </p><p> </p><p>--issue a final statement after the election providing a </p><p>judgment on whether it was free and fair.  Such an </p><p>assessment, of course, will depend on whether the environment </p><p>continues to be as destructive as it is now, and on the </p><p>outcome. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
