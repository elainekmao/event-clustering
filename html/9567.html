<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001846 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OSD FOR DASD IAN BRZEZINSKI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, NL, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH CONCERNS ABOUT FURTHER FRANCO-GERMAN EFFORTS </p><p>ON MINI-SUMMIT AGENDA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRS DANNY R. RUSSEL FOR REASO </p><p>NS 1.5 (B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>(A/S Beth Jones has cleared this cable.) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  In July 15 conversations with visiting </p><p>Assistant Secretary Jones and the Ambassador, senior Dutch </p><p>officials expressed concerns about Franco-German efforts to </p><p>take concrete steps to implement decisions from the April 29 </p><p>"Mini-Summit," especially the establishment of a distinct EU </p><p>military headquarters at Tervuren, Belgium.  The PM\'s foreign </p><p>policy advisor shared his broader concern about German-French </p><p>efforts to woo the UK (exploiting the pressures currently on </p><p>Blair) and to pull other Europeans into their orbit.  While </p><p>there appear to be differences within the Dutch foreign </p><p>policy team as to how real a threat this is, they agree the </p><p>idea is moving ahead, and urge a nuanced U.S. response so as </p><p>not to "corner" the proponents and thus give impetus to their </p><p>plans.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a July 15 meeting with the Ambassador, PM </p><p>Balkenende\'s Foreign Policy Advisor Rob Swartbol (protect) </p><p>raised concerns that the France/Germany/Belgium/Luxembourg </p><p>April 29 Mini-Summit agenda, in particular, the idea of a </p><p>separate EU military headquarters, was gaining ground within </p><p>some European governments.  Swartbol said the EU\'s mission in </p><p>Congo had lent momentum to the idea and suggested that a </p><p>recent French, German and UK political directors meeting in </p><p>Paris was aimed at getting the British onboard.  He asserted </p><p>there was also a serious European effort to support the </p><p>broader German-French agenda.  The EU headquarters idea is </p><p>just one example.  Swartbol suggested several streams were </p><p>feeding the initiative.  First, many in Europe were anxious </p><p>to heal the rifts after Iraq and thus want to come together </p><p>on a major foreign policy issue.  Others are motivated by </p><p>resentments against the U.S.  In any event, France and </p><p>Germany are forming a rallying point for Europe that could </p><p>gain momentum and should not be ignored by the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Swartbol again raised this issue at a luncheon for </p><p>visiting Assistant Secretary Jones on July 15.  MFA Deputy </p><p>Political Director Herman Schaper (protect) said the Tervuren </p><p>headquarters idea would not evolve into a "European SHAPE" </p><p>since too many countries (including the Netherlands) oppose </p><p>it.  He thought it would instead become like the Eurocorps, </p><p>i.e., another element in the tool box of the European allies. </p><p> A/S Jones said the U.S. had been concerned that Prague </p><p>Summit decisions and Berlin Plus were being undercut by the </p><p>April 29 Mini-Summit.  Schaper said the German Chancellor\'s </p><p>office had been putting pressure on the Netherlands to join </p><p>the project, claiming that the UK was now more supportive. </p><p>His suggested approach was to avoid dramatizing French-German </p><p>efforts, and said there would never be consensus for an ESDP </p><p>based on distancing Europe from the U.S.  MFA Director for </p><p>Security Policy Maurits Jochems (protect) suggested that the </p><p>U.S. reach out to the French and German defense ministries, </p><p>which oppose the Tervuren idea. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Comment:  Dutch concern about the potential for </p><p>Franco-German efforts to create rifts within Europe and </p><p>across the Atlantic prompted the cautionary note to be </p><p>sounded by the PM\'s Foreign Policy Advisor.  He is clearly of </p><p>the view that, while the U.S. should not resist European </p><p>integration, Washington needs to be aware and careful of </p><p>Paris-Berlin initiatives. However, all agreed that </p><p>heavy-handed U.S. objections to the proposal would likely </p><p>have the opposite effect and result in the Franco-German </p><p>proposal gaining more European support. End Comment. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
