(SBU) ALTHOUGH THE HOLY SEE IS PRESSING HARD FOR THE </p><p>EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTINENT\'S CHRISTIAN </p><p>HERITAGE, THIS DRIVE IS IN NO WAY INTENDED TO SUGGEST HOLY </p><p>SEE OPPOSITION TO TURKEY\'S EU MEMBERSHIP.  ON THE CONTRARY, </p><p>THIS EFFORT PREDATES THE CURRENT DEBATE OVER TURKEY, AND THE </p><p>HOLY SEE SPECIFICALLY FAVORS CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE THAT </p><p>WOULD ENSURE FREEDOM OF WORSHIP TO ALL FAITHS.  IN PUSHING </p><p>FOR A "CHRISTIAN HERITAGE" REFERENCE AND OTHER PROVISIONS </p><p>RELATING TO RELIGION, THE HOLY SEE IS SEEKING A FOUNDATION </p><p>ON WHICH TO COUNTER THE INCREASINGLY DOMINANT SECULARISM </p><p>WITHIN EUROPE AND TO REINVIGORATE THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN </p><p>EUROPEAN CULTURE.  THE HOLY SEE IN NO WAY SEEKS TO EXCLUDE </p><p>OTHER FAITHS OR PHILOSOPHIES, AND HAS TOLD US DIRECTLY THEY </p><p>HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH A PREDOMINANTLY ISLAMIC STATE SUCH AS </p><p>TURKEY BEING A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION -- A DECISION IN </p><p>WHICH THEY HAVE NO DIRECT ROLE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>EUROPE\'S CHRISTIAN ROOTS IN ARID SOIL </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE HOLY SEE IS PRESSING EUROPEANS HARD TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT THE PROPOSED EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION INCLUDES A REFERENCE </p><p>TO THE CONTINENT\'S CHRISTIAN HERITAGE, WHILE AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME MAKING CLEAR THAT JURIDICAL PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE TO </p><p>PROTECT ALL RELIGIOUS FAITHS.  FROM THE POPE ON DOWN, THE </p><p>HOLY SEE HAS BEEN LOBBYING EUROPEAN POLICY MAKERS ACTIVELY </p><p>IN RECENT MONTHS.  ACCORDING TO THE POPE, "CHRISTIANITY IS A </p><p>CENTRAL AND INHERENT ELEMENT" OF THE EUROPEAN IDENTITY, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05753  01 OF 03  271518Z </p><p>"THE CHRISTIAN FAITH FORMED THE CULTURE OF THE CONTINENT." </p><p>FRAMING THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THE HOLY SEE\'S CURRENT FOCUS </p><p>ON THE EU CONSTITUTION, THE POPE TOLD THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>IN HIS ANNUAL ADDRESS LAST JANUARY (REF A) THAT "THE </p><p>MARGINALIZATION OF RELIGIONS, WHICH HAVE CONTRIBUTED AND </p><p>CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CULTURE AND HUMANITY OF WHICH </p><p>EUROPE IS LEGITIMATELY PROUD, STRIKES ME BOTH AS AN </p><p>INJUSTICE AND AN ERROR IN PERSPECTIVE."  REFERRING TO THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION, HE ADDED: </p><p>"TO RECOGNIZE AN INDISPUTABLE HISTORICAL FACT IN NO WAY </p><p>MEANS TO DISREGARD THE MODERN DEMAND OF STATES TO HAVE AN </p><p>APPROPRIATE NON-CONFESSIONAL CHARACTER." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THIS FALL, THE HOLY SEE HAS INTENSIFIED ITS OUTREACH </p><p>TO EU COUNTRIES WHEN IT CALLED IN ALL EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS </p><p>TO OUTLINE ITS PRIORITIES FOR THE FINAL CONSTITUTION.  THESE </p><p>PRIORITIES ENCOMPASS REFERENCES TO FIVE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES: </p><p>CENTRALITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, </p><p>SOLIDARITY (THE SEARCH FOR THE COMMON GOOD), SUBSIDIARITY </p><p>AND PARTICIPATION, AND THE SHARING OF RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN </p><p>THE CHURCHES AND THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN ADDITION, THE HOLY SEE IS ALSO SEEKING JURIDICAL </p><p>RECOGNITION OF THE CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES WITHIN </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION.  THEY NOTE THAT RELIGION, CHURCHES, AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY EU LEGISLATION </p><p>FOR DECADES, BUT THAT THERE ARE NO REFERENCES TO RELIGIONS </p><p>IN THE TREATY PROVISIONS OR ANNEXED PROTOCOLS.  THEY POINT </p><p>OUT THAT ISSUES SUCH AS NON-DISCRIMINATION, LABOR LAW, DATA </p><p>PROTECTION, CULTURE, MEDIA LAW, CUSTOMS, FINANCES AND OTHER </p><p>AREAS ALL IMPACT ON THE CHURCH, AND THAT THE ABSENCE OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05753  01 OF 03  271518Z </p><p>JURIDICAL REFERENCES TO THEM WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS </p><p>VACUUM.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE HOLY SEE IS SEEKING THROUGH THE </p><p>COMMISSION OF EPISCOPATES OF THE EU A PROVISION ASSURING THE </p><p>RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION OF CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>COMMUNITIES IN THEIR TEACHING AND ORGANIZATION.  THEY DO NOT </p><p>BELIEVE THAT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OR CORPORATIVE SELF- </p><p>DETERMINATION IS GUARANTEED BY ARTICLE 10 OF THE CHARTER OF </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EU OR ARTICLE 9 OF THE EUROPEAN </p><p>CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  FINALLY, THE HOLY SEE WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO INCLUDE A PROVISION FOR CIVIL SOCIETY DIALOGUE AND </p><p>CONSULTATION SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO THE ROLE OF CHURCHES </p><p>AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) HAVING OUTLINED ITS GOALS, THE POPE HAS USED EVERY </p><p>OPPORTUNITY THIS FALL TO PRESS HIS CASE.  IN HIS MEETINGS </p><p>WITH EU AMBASSADOR\'S HE HAS REPEATED HIS INSISTENCE THAT </p><p>EUROPE MUST BE FOUNDED ON "COMMON VALUES, TAKING INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT THE CHRISTIAN ROOTS OF THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE" WHO </p><p>LIVE ON THE CONTINENT.  LIKEWISE, THE POPE\'S MEETING WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION, VALERIE GISCARD </p><p>D\'ESTAING, FOCUSED ON THE CONCERNS OF EUROPE\'S CHRISTIAN </p><p>MAJORITY "TO SEE THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR SPECIFIC </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO THE LIFE OF EUROPEAN SOCIETY RESPECTED" AND </p><p>TO HAVE THE STATUS THEY ENJOY IN CERTAIN NATIONAL </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8542 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05753  02 OF 03  271520Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   NSAE-00  PER-00   TEST-00  EPAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------0F8011  271658Z /38 </p><p>R 271353Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 VATICAN 005753 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); EUR/SE; EUR/ERA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PINS, EU, PGOV, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: THE HOLY SEE AND THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION: </p><p> </p><p>COUNTERING SECULARISM, NOT TURKEY\'S EUROPEAN AMBITIONS </p><p> </p><p>CONSTITUTIONS REFLECTED IN THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION.  MOST </p><p>RECENTLY, IN THE FIRST EVER PAPAL ADDRESS TO BOTH HOUSES OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT NOVEMBER 14, JOHN PAUL II CALLED FOR </p><p>EUROPE TO "OPEN ONCE AGAIN YOUR DOORS TO CHRIST."  WHILE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05753  02 OF 03  271520Z </p><p>STRESSING THE CONTINENT\'S RELIGIOUS PATRIMONY (READ </p><p>CHRISTIANITY), WHICH HAS "GIVEN EUROPE ITS GREATNESS DOWN </p><p>THE CENTURIES," THE PONTIFF ALSO SUPPORTED PROVIDING ROOM </p><p>FOR THE "RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY OF THE CULTURES AND </p><p>TRADITIONS WHICH CHARACTERIZE INDIVIDUAL NATIONS (I.E. OTHER </p><p>RELIGIONS)." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>CHRISTIAN HERITAGE AS SEEN FROM THE CURIA </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) VATICAN DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS MSGR. ETTORE </p><p>BALESTRERO EXPANDED ON THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS IN A NOVEMBER 18 </p><p>MEETING WITH POLOFF.  BALESTRERO ESTIMATED THAT ON A </p><p>CONTINENT OF ROUGHLY 700 MILLION PEOPLE, ABOUT 500 MILLION </p><p>WERE CHRISTIAN. (NOTE: THE VATICAN\'S STATISTICAL YEARBOOK OF </p><p>THE CHURCH COUNTS 702 MILLION POPULATION IN EUROPE WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES ALL OF THE OSCE COUNTRIES EXCEPT THE U.S., CANADA </p><p>AND TURKEY. END NOTE.)  FURTHERMORE, BALESTRERO RECALLED, </p><p>CHRISTIANITY, UNLIKE OTHER FAITHS, WAS THE COMMON ELEMENT </p><p>THAT BOUND THE CLASSIC EUROPEAN CIVILIZATIONS OF GREECE AND </p><p>ROME TO MODERN EUROPE.  IT WAS CHRISTIAN MONKS WHO HAD </p><p>PRESERVED EUROPE\'S KNOWLEDGE, AND JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ETHICS </p><p>THAT INFORM MODERN NOTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE WAS SIMPLY SEEKING TO ENSURE THAT EUROPE\'S </p><p>CONSTITUTION RECOGNIZES THIS "REALITY" -- BUT WITHOUT ANY </p><p>NORMATIVE OR OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES.  BALESTRERO SAID THE </p><p>HOLY SEE STILL SUPPORTS LANGUAGE IN A EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION </p><p>GUARANTEEING FREEDOM OF RELIGION, WITH IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>DEVOLVED TO THE NATION-STATES ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF </p><p>SUBSIDIARITY.  THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THIS, HE ADMITTED, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05753  02 OF 03  271520Z </p><p>WOULD BE TO ENSHRINE THE PRIVILEGES AND RIGHTS OF THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH IN COUNTRIES WHERE CONCORDATS PROVIDE FOR </p><p>THEM, AND ALSO FOR THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN COUNTRIES WHERE IT </p><p>PREDOMINATES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  BALESTRERO ALSO NOTED A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S ROLE IN THIS DEBATE:  THE IDEA FOR LANGUAGE IN </p><p>THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION ACKNOWLEDGING CHRISTIANITY WAS </p><p>DEVELOPED BY A MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPEAN CHURCHES </p><p>(CEC - A PROTESTANT GROUP).  ONLY LATER DID THE HOLY SEE </p><p>(AND GREEK ORTHODOX) JOIN THEIR VOICES TO IT.  THE HOLY SEE, </p><p>BALESTRERO CONTINUED, VIEWS THIS LANGUAGE AS ENHANCING THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF ALL RELIGIONS IN EUROPE\'S DAILY LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>A CHRISTIAN HERITAGE BUT ROOM FOR ALL </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.   (SBU) CHALLENGED ON THE UNDENIABLE CONTRIBUTION TO </p><p>EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION FROM A JEWISH PRESENCE THAT PREDATES </p><p>THE CHRISTIAN ONE, AND THE HALF-MILLENNIUM LONG ISLAMIC </p><p>CONTROL OF IBERIA AND THE BALKANS, BALESTRERO SAID THE HOLY </p><p>SEE DOES NOT DENY THESE INFLUENCES, THOUGH THEY REGARD THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE AS HISTORICALLY PREDOMINANT.  MOREOVER, </p><p>THE HOLY SEE IS A CHRISTIAN ENTITY AND IS PUSHING FOR ITS </p><p>CHRISTIAN INTERESTS; IT HAS NO OBJECTION TO ANYONE ELSE </p><p>SEEKING TO INTERJECT LANGUAGE ON CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OTHER </p><p>SOURCES.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD RECENTLY SHARED A TEXT OF </p><p>PROPOSED LANGUAGE WITH JEWISH LEADERS, WHO SUPPORTED IT. </p><p>MORE RECENTLY, DURING A VATICAN RADIO DISCUSSION ON THE </p><p>EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION, EUROPEAN PEOPLES PARTY PRESIDENT, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05753  02 OF 03  271520Z </p><p>WILFRED MARTENS, NOTED THAT THE POPE IS PUSHING FOR LANGUAGE </p><p>SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE POLISH CONSTITUTION TO THE EFFECT </p><p>THAT JUDEO-CHRISTIAN NOTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE CAN </p><p>BE ARRIVED AT FROM BELIEF IN GOD OR OTHER SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  THE POPE HIMSELF, WHILE AFFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>EUROPEAN COMMUNITY RECOGNITION OF THE CONTINENT\'S CHRISTIAN </p><p>HERITAGE, CAUTIONED IN A SEPTEMBER 13 ADDRESS THAT THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMON EUROPEAN IDENTITY SHOULD NOT BE USED </p><p>AS AN EXCUSE FOR HOSTILITY TOWARDS MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. HE </p><p>ARGUED AGAINST ANY TENDENCY TOWARD "ISOLATION FROM THE REST </p><p>OF THE WORLD." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ALSO ROOM FOR TURKEY </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE PLACE OF TURKEY IN A </p><p>NEW EUROPE AND THE FALLOUT FROM GISCARD D\'ESTAING\'S MEETING </p><p>WITH THE POPE (RFTEL B), BALESTRERO SAID GISCARD </p><p>D\'ESTAING\'S VIES WERE NOT THOSE OF THE HOLY SEE.  THE HOLY </p><p>SEE HS NO OBJECTION TO TURKISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU, BU </p><p>HAS NO ROLE IN DECIDING THAT MEMBERSHIP.

IN FACT, CARDINAL ACHILLE SILVESTRINI, PREFECT OF THE </p><p>CONGREGATION FOR RELATIONS WITH EASTERN CHURCHES, IN AN </p><p>INTERVIEW FOLLOWING THE TURKISH ELECTION RESULTS EMPHASIZED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF DIALOGUE WITH TURKEY AND CAUTIONED AGAINST </p><p>VIEWING ISLAM "PURELY IN ITS AGGRESSIVE AND FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>COMPONENT" RATHER THAN "A RELIGION CAPABLE OF TOLERANCE." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) GISCARD D\'ESTAING\'S DECISION TO LAUNCH HIS </p><p>BROADSIDE AGAINST TURKISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU SHORTLY AFTER </p><p>HIS MEETING WITH THE POPE HAS UNNECESSARILY LED MANY TO VIEW </p><p>THE HOLY SEE AS INVOLVED IN WHAT IS A PURELY EUROPEAN </p><p>DOGFIGHT.  AT NO TIME IN ANY OF OUR DISCUSSIONS OF THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S LONGSTANDING CONCERNS ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE FUTURE EU </p><p>CONSTITUTION HAS TURKEY\'S EU MEMBERSHIP EVER ARISEN.    THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S INTERESTS -- BOTH IN IMBEDDING REFERENCES TO KEY </p><p>VALUES AND ENSURING JURIDICAL PROTECTIONS -- PREDATE CURRENT </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TURKEY\'S PLACE IN EUROPE.  TO BE SURE, </p><p>THERE ARE MANY CATHOLIC INTELLECTUALS, SUCH AS ITALIAN </p><p>MINISTER FOR EU AFFAIRS, ROCCO BUTTIGLIONE, WHO QUESTION </p><p>WHETHER A MUSLIM TURKEY SHARES EUROPE\'S  VALUE SYSTEM, WHICH </p><p>THEY REGARD AS DERIVED FROM JUDEO-CHRISTIAN TRADITIONS.  BUT </p><p>EVEN BUTTIGLIONE IN A RECENT SPEECH HERE LEFT OPEN THE DOOR </p><p>THAT TURKEY COULD OVERCOME THESE DOUBTS BY BETTER PROTECTING </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND STRENGTHENING ITS DEMOCRACY.
