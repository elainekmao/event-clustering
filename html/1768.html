(SBU) SUMMARY: ON MAY 23, POLOFF VISITED WITH </p><p>PRIESTS OF THE VIETNAMESE CATHOLIC ORDER OF CO- </p><p>REDEMPTION IN HCMC.  ALTHOUGH ONLY TWO OF ITS MEMBERS </p><p>ARE CURRENTLY IN PRISON, THE ORDER HAS BEEN AMONG THE </p><p>MOST PERSECUTED OF VIETNAM\'S RELIGIOUS GROUPS SINCE </p><p>1975.  IT STILL OPERATES AN "UNDERGROUND SEMINARY" IN </p><p>HCMC.  UNTIL NOW, INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO POST ABOUT </p><p>THE ORDER HAD ALL BEEN SECOND-HAND.  THE VISIT PROVIDED </p><p>USEFUL FIRST-HAND BACKGROUND ON THIS RELIGIOUS ORDER\'S </p><p>HISTORY OF PROBLEMS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ORIGINS OF THE CO-REDEMPTRIX ORDER </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) POLOFF AND CONGEN INTERPRETER VISITED THE </p><p>CATHOLIC ORDER OF CO-REDEMPTION ON MAY 23 IN HCMC\'S THU </p><p>DUC DISTRICT.  AFTER BEING LED TO AN INNER CHAMBER TO </p><p>AVOID BEING OVERHEARD BY A PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN WHO </p><p>ENTERED THE COMPOUND WITHIN A MINUTE OF THEIR ARRIVAL, </p><p>THEY MET WITH AN ELDERLY PRIEST WHO WOULD IDENTIFY </p><p>HIMSELF ONLY AS "FATHER JOHN."  FATHER JOHN, LIKE THE </p><p>OTHER CO-REDEMPTRIX PRIESTS, WAS BORN IN BUI CHU </p><p>DIOCESE SOUTHEAST OF HANOI.  HE WAS AMONG THE 40 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00754  01 OF 02  200231Z </p><p>PERSONS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY DURING A POLICE RAID ON THE </p><p>ORDER IN 1987.  HE, ALONG WITH FATHER TRAN DINH THU </p><p>(FOUNDER OF THE ORDER), RECEIVED A 19-YEAR PRISON </p><p>SENTENCE, BUT LIKE FATHER THU, HE WAS RELEASED IN 1993 </p><p>AFTER SERVING SIX AND ONE HALF YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) FATHER TRAN DINH THU, BORN IN NORTHERN VIETNAM </p><p>IN 1906, FOUNDED THE ORDER OF CO-REDEMPTION IN 1953 IN </p><p>BUI CHU DIOCESE.  FATHER JOHN SAID THAT IN THE EARLY </p><p>1950\'S "A STATE OF WAR" EXISTED BETWEEN THE COMMUNISTS </p><p>AND THE CATHOLIC DIOCESES OF BUI CHU AND NEIGHBORING </p><p>PHAT DIEM.  FATHER THU ESTABLISHED THE ORDER NOT TO </p><p>ENGAGE IN THE ARMED FIGHTING, ACCORDING TO FATHER JOHN, </p><p>BUT ONLY TO EVANGELIZE AMONG THE NON-CHRISTIANS IN THE </p><p>NORTH. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) FATHER THU, FATHER JOHN AND THE OTHER CO- </p><p>REDEMPTRIX PRIESTS WERE AMONG THE MORE THAN 600 </p><p>CATHOLIC PRIESTS WHO JOINED THE EXODUS OF NEARLY ONE </p><p>MILLION PEOPLE (MOSTLY CATHOLICS) WHO ESCAPED TO THE </p><p>SOUTH IN 1954 AHEAD OF PARTITION.  THEY ESTABLISHED A </p><p>15-ACRE HEADQUARTERS AND SEMINARY IN THE THU DUC </p><p>DISTRICT OF PRESENT-DAY HCMC, AND GRADUALLY EXPANDED </p><p>THEIR MISSION TO THE MEKONG DELTA AND SOUTH CENTRAL </p><p>VIETNAM.  FATHER JOHN SAID THAT EVEN NOW, ALL OF THE CO- </p><p>REDEMPTRIX PRIESTS ORIGINALLY ARE FROM THE BUI CHU </p><p>DIOCESE; POLOFF NOTICED THAT EVERYONE HE HEARD ON THE </p><p>GROUNDS ON MAY 23 SPOKE WITH A NORTH VIETNAMESE ACCENT. </p><p> </p><p>POSTWAR PROBLEMS </p><p>---------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00754  01 OF 02  200231Z </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) AFTER APRIL 30, 1975, SOME 60 MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>ORDER WERE ARRESTED, INCLUDING THE FOUNDER, FATHER THU. </p><p>MOST OF THOSE ARRESTED, INCLUDING FATHER THU, WERE </p><p>RELEASED IN 1977.  BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONFISCATED THE ORDER\'S PROPERTIES IN THE SOUTH OF </p><p>VIETNAM - SCHOOLS, ORPHANAGES, RELIGIOUS TRAINING </p><p>CENTERS - EXCEPT FOR THE 15-ACRE SITE AT THU DUC. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) ON MAY 15, 1987, VIETNAMESE SECURITY FORCES </p><p>SURROUNDED THE ORDER\'S 15-ACRE COMPLEX AND ARRESTED 40 </p><p>PRIESTS AND LAYPERSONS, INCLUDING FATHER THU AND FATHER </p><p>JOHN.  THEY CLOSED THE MONASTERY AT THE SITE AND </p><p>CONFISCATED THE PROPERTY.  FATHER THU AND FATHER JOHN </p><p>RECEIVED 19-YEAR PRISON SENTENCES, BUT WERE RELEASED IN </p><p>1993 AFTER SERVING SIX AND ONE HALF YEARS.  ALL BUT TWO </p><p>OF THE OTHERS ARRESTED IN 1987 ALSO HAVE SINCE BEEN </p><p>RELEASED.  THE TWO WHO REMAIN IN PRISON ARE FATHER PHAM </p><p>MINH TRI AND LAYPERSON NGUYEN THIEN PHUNG INCARCERATED </p><p>AT Z30A PRISON AT XUAN LOC IN DONG NAI PROVINCE. </p><p>FATHER JOHN SAID SIXTY-YEAR OLD FATHER TRI HAS BEEN </p><p>SUFFERING NERVOUS/MENTAL PROBLEMS FOR THE PAST FIVE </p><p>YEARS AS A RESULT OF HIS IMPRISONMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) THE ORDER\'S SCHOOL BUILDINGS AT THE 15-ACRE </p><p>SITE HAVE NOW BEEN TURNED INTO A GOVERNMENT SCHOOL. </p><p>SOME OF THE OTHER BUILDINGS ON THE SITE HAVE BEEN </p><p>TURNED INTO A TEXTILE FACTORY.  THIRTEEN PRIESTS AND 30 </p><p>LAYPERSONS NOW LIVE AT THE SITE NEAR THE OLD </p><p>HEADQUARTERS ON PROPERTY DONATED TO THEM BY A CATHOLIC </p><p>LAYMAN.  FATHER JOHN SAID THERE WERE 300 TO 400 OTHER </p><p>"UNOFFICIAL RESIDENTS" AT THIS SITE.  THEN HE WHISPERED </p><p>IN ENGLISH THAT THE ORDER STILL OPERATES AN </p><p>"UNDERGROUND SEMINARY" THERE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) FATHER JOHN SAID POLICE USED TO COME INTO THE </p><p>COMPOUND THREE OR FOUR TIMES A MONTH TO "HARASS THE </p><p>RESIDENTS." BUT BEGINNING ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, AFTER </p><p>THE INVESTITURE OF FATHER PHAM MINH MAN AS ARCHBISHOP </p><p>OF HCMC ARCHDIOCESE, THEY HAVE EASED UP AND NOW ENTER </p><p>ONLY OCCASIONALLY.  FATHER JOHN NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THE DISTRICT POLICE STATION IS "CONVENIENTLY LOCATED" </p><p>JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE COMPOUND. </p><p> </p><p>FATHER THU AND CARTHAGE, MISSOURI </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00754  02 OF 02  200231Z </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) POLOFF HAD REQUESTED TO MEET WITH THE ORDER\'S </p><p>95-YEAR-OLD FOUNDER, FATHER TRAN DINH THU, BUT WAS TOLD </p><p>ON ARRIVAL THAT FATHER THU WAS "TOO TIRED" TO MEET.  ON </p><p>DEPARTURE, HOWEVER, FATHER JOHN BROUGHT POLOFF INTO </p><p>ANOTHER ROOM WHERE FATHER THU WAS TALKING WITH SEVERAL </p><p>PRIESTS AND NUNS.  ALTHOUGH HE APPEARED EXTREMELY </p><p>FRAIL, FATHER THU DID NOT SEEM ALL THAT TIRED.  IN </p><p>THEIR TWO-MINUTE CONVERSATION, FATHER THU NOTED THAT </p><p>THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO WELCOME A WESTERN VISITOR TO HIS CHAMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) BUT THE CO-REDEMPTRIX ORDER DOES HAVE WESTERN </p><p>CONNECTIONS.  FATHER JOHN STATED THAT THE ORDER HAD </p><p>ESTABLISHED A RELATIONSHIP WITH A CATHOLIC PARISH IN </p><p>CARTHAGE, MISSOURI.  DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST </p><p>EVERY YEAR, THE CHURCH IN CARTHAGE WELCOMES THOUSANDS </p><p>OF VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN CATHOLICS WHO COME THERE TO PRAY </p><p>IN FRONT OF A STATUE OF MARY THAT WAS FASHIONED IN AND </p><p>IMPORTED FROM FATIMA IN PORTUGAL.  (NOTE: VIETNAMESE </p><p>CATHOLICS IN VIETNAM MAKE A SIMILAR PILGRIMAGE IN THE </p><p>FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST TO A CHURCH IN LA VANG IN CENTRAL </p><p>VIETNAM AT THE SITE WHERE MARY IS SAID TO HAVE APPEARED </p><p>200 YEARS AGO.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) WITH ONLY A FOUR-YEAR DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN </p><p>HCMC AFTER A MORE THAN 20-YEAR ABSENCE, CONGEN </p><p>PERSONNEL STILL HAVE MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT VIETNAM\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00754  02 OF 02  200231Z </p><p>POSTWAR YEARS.  POST CONTINUES TO SEEK OUT AND MEET </p><p>HISTORICAL FIGURES SINCE THE PAST IN VIETNAM CONTINUES </p><p>TO HAUNT EVERY ASPECT OF THE PRESENT, AND THE </p><p>HISTORICAL LEGACIES OFTEN HOLD KEYS TO BETTER </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THE MORE CURRENT ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
