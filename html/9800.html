<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 004764 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ECON, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT OPENS, ERRANT MP\'S SWEAR PROPER OATH; </p><p>GOJ BEGINS TO FEEL PARLIAMENTARY PRESSURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 4408 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 4533 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 4577 </p><p>     D. AMMAN 4246 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The just-begun special session of the Parliament </p><p>will examine Parliamentary bylaws, consider a vote of </p><p>confidence in the new cabinet, begin to examine more than 200 </p><p>temporary laws promulgated by the government, and adjudicate </p><p>complaints of irregularities in the June polls.   The Lower </p><p>House has formed 14 committees -- and also required 30 MPs </p><p>who added words to their oath of office to retake the correct </p><p>constitutional oath.  The new Speaker, Secretary General, and </p><p>some MPs with whom we have spoken believe the membership of </p><p>the new Parliament is generally younger and better educated </p><p>than in the past, and hope this is a good sign for democracy </p><p>in Jordan.  One dissenting MP is reserving judgment, and is </p><p>already complaining that many of his colleagues seem more </p><p>concerned with their own personal perks than the common good. </p><p> Government ministers expect pressure from new MPs for </p><p>greater spending and more favors, and seem to view the new </p><p>Parliament with a mix of trepidation and paternalism.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY AGENDA - BYLAWS, VOTE OF CONFIDENCE... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The newly elected Parliament has begun thrice-weekly </p><p>meetings in a special summer session which is scheduled to </p><p>run through the end of September.  DCM and PolCouns paid a </p><p>courtesy call July 21 on the newly elected speaker, Saad </p><p>Hayel Srour (ref a).  Srour said his priorities for the </p><p>special session would include changing the internal rules of </p><p>Parliament to make its work more efficient, dealing with a </p><p>vote of confidence in the new government, and examining the </p><p>more than 200 "temporary laws" the government had promulgated </p><p>in the absence of Parliament.  On parliamentary by-laws, </p><p>Srour said he wanted to increase the size of committees to </p><p>reflect the new, larger house, and reform debate on the floor </p><p>of the house so that not all MPs have the right to speak on </p><p>all issues.  Lower House Secretary General, Dr. Mohammad </p><p>Masalha, told PolCouns July 29 that he expects the MPs to </p><p>vote for an increase of committee size from 11 to 13 or 15. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Masalha said that PM Ali Abul Ragheb would come to </p><p>the Parliament on August 6 and formally present his </p><p>reshuffled government (refs b and c) for a vote of </p><p>confidence.  Srour commented that he expected at least 3-4 </p><p>days of debate on the new government, debate that would </p><p>likely include a large number of personal attacks on </p><p>ministers.  In the end, he said, the government could be </p><p>assured of getting at least 70 of the 110 votes.  He </p><p>commented that, in his discussions with Abul Ragheb, the PM </p><p>seemed more confident and energetic than he had earlier in </p><p>the year. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>...AND MORE THAN 200 TEMPORARY LAWS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Srour said the real meat of the special session </p><p>would be examining the more than 200 temporary laws </p><p>promulgated by the government in the absence of Parliament. </p><p>Masalha said the government had formally sent 211 temporary </p><p>laws to the Parliament for review, and that the Parliament </p><p>would begin to distribute these laws to committees on July </p><p>30.  According to current plans, Masalha said, the Speaker </p><p>hopes to conduct most of the review of these laws in the </p><p>appropriate committees, thereby reducing the time spent on </p><p>debate in the full Parliament.  He expected that only a </p><p>fraction of these laws would actually come to a vote during </p><p>this special session, and that the task would extend well </p><p>into the regular session which will begin in the Fall.  DCM </p><p>emphasized to the Speaker the importance to Jordan of </p><p>unamended passage of many of the temporary laws, especially </p><p>those tied to Jordan\'s WTO membership, the U.S.-Jordan FTA, </p><p>and general economic reform. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>...AND DON\'T FORGET ELECTORAL COMPLAINTS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Masalha said that seven committees had been formed </p><p>to investigate the 54 complaints of irregularities in the </p><p>June 17 voting (ref d).  He said that no member would be </p><p>permitted to sit on a committee that would hear a complaint </p><p>that could affect the results of his/her election.  The MPs </p><p>had also finalized on July 28 membership in the fourteen </p><p>standing committees of the Lower House.  The committees will </p><p>meet in the next week and select Chairpersons, Masalha said. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>AN OATH RETAKEN - CORRECTLY THIS TIME </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Srour told DCM that MPs from the Islamic Action </p><p>Front had added several words to the end of their original </p><p>oaths of office, adding an allegiance to God, the Quran, and </p><p>the prophet Mohammad (ref a).  "This was a message for their </p><p>street," Srour declared.  Several other MPs had subsequently </p><p>added different words to their oaths supporting Jordanian </p><p>democracy or the "Jordan First" campaign.  Srour blamed the </p><p>problem on the fact that, by tradition, the oldest MP chairs </p><p>the opening session of Parliament until the election of the </p><p>Speaker.  Srour commented that Abdul Hafeez al-Heet, the </p><p>oldest member in the current Parliament, had no previous </p><p>Parliamentary experience, and the IAF had taken advantage of </p><p>his age.  "He was not up to the challenge."  He said he told </p><p>the IAF and other errant MPs that they must return to the </p><p>constitutional basis for working in the Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Masalha confirmed that all 30 members who had added </p><p>words to their oaths -- including those from the IAF -- had </p><p>retaken the proper constitutional oath during the session on </p><p>July 28.  The members had been permitted to make short </p><p>remarks prefacing their oaths, Masalha remarked, although few </p><p>actually did.  A constitutional committee had decided that </p><p>the MPs must retake the oath, but also decided that the </p><p>actions of the house up to the second oath taking -- </p><p>including election of a speaker and selection of committees </p><p>-- were valid. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>YOUNGER, BETTER EDUCATED PARLIAMENT </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Srour described the new MPs as generally younger and </p><p>better educated than past Parliaments -- he counted 49 </p><p>engineers, 18 medical doctors, and numerous Ph.D. holders </p><p>(see ref d).  He commented that tribal areas, especially the </p><p>Central Badia (which elected three doctors) had chosen </p><p>educated MPs who in many cases had defeated their tribal </p><p>sheikhs.  In selecting more educated and professional MPs, </p><p>Srour argued, voters did not listen to fiery speeches or </p><p>their tribal sheikhs, but rather "used their minds" to select </p><p>their representatives. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Masalha and MP Mohammad Arsalan, winner of the </p><p>Chechen seat from Zarqa, agreed substantially with this </p><p>assessment.  Arsalan told PolCouns that he has been impressed </p><p>with the energy and seriousness of his new colleagues. </p><p>Arsalan, who is a past Secretary General of the Zarqa Chamber </p><p>of Commerce and will sit on the Economic and Finance </p><p>Committee, said that he has already found 8 MPs who plan to </p><p>found with him a "reformist" bloc.  He said that "progressive </p><p>thinking" MPs had secured a majority of the seats on the </p><p>Economic and Finance Committee, and he hoped this would </p><p>ensure passage of the temporary laws associated with WTO </p><p>accession, the U.S.-Jordan FTA, and the King\'s economic </p><p>liberalization program without significant amendment. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Another new MP, Mohammad Suleiman al-Shawabkeh from </p><p>Madaba, held a less optimistic view of the new Parliament. </p><p>He told PolCouns that he had already found that many MPs are </p><p>more concerned with securing their own personal perks of </p><p>office than with properly organizing their work or cementing </p><p>voting blocs.  Shawabkeh fears that clientitis and "wasta" </p><p>could quickly overwhelm most members, who are likely to </p><p>rubber stamp the government\'s temporary laws rather than take </p><p>the time to understand and evaluate them.  Senator Marwan </p><p>Kasim told the DCM that he did not expect the quality of MPs </p><p>to improve, but that the Parliament must, at a minimum, </p><p>regularly question PM Abul Ragheb and his ministers to keep </p><p>them honest.  (Note.  SecGen Masalha confirmed that every </p><p>fourth session is reserved for questions for the government </p><p>-- about once every ten days.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>GOVERNMENT BRACES FOR MP\'S REQUESTS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Conversations with government ministers indicate </p><p>that several view the new Parliament with a mix of </p><p>trepidation and paternalism.  Finance Minister Michel Marto </p><p>told the DCM that he would likely come under pressure from </p><p>new MPs "to spend money."  He noted, however, that he had </p><p>"dealt with Parliaments before" and would just have to </p><p>educate MPs on the fiscal realities of Jordan.  Similarly, </p><p>Planning Minister Bassam Awadallah (whose courtesy call from </p><p>the DCM was delayed when an MP barged into his office with a </p><p>constituent request) described the new MPs as "not that </p><p>serious" and only looking for favors.  He, too, expects </p><p>pressure from the Parliament for project and spending </p><p>increases. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  Ministers expect pressures in other areas as well. </p><p>New Information Minister Nabil Sharif told the Ambassador and </p><p>DCM July 30 that several MPs had complained that Jordan </p><p>Television had not carried their speeches in the opening </p><p>session of the Parliament.  "We can\'t carry fifty speeches </p><p>every day," Sharif complained.  He also was troubled by signs </p><p>of an anti-reform, anti-IMF mood in some quarters of </p><p>Parliament.  New Deputy PM and Minister for Economic Affairs </p><p>Mohammad Halaiqa said that the Parliament had approved </p><p>government budgets from 2001 and 2002 by voice vote July 30, </p><p>but had postponed a vote on privatization at the request of </p><p>IAF deputies.  The IAF, he explained, is not opposed to </p><p>privatization, but wants to know where the proceeds of </p><p>privatization have gone.  "We are in for a rough ride," </p><p>Halaiqa commented.  But in the end, he was confident that the </p><p>government would pass the temporary laws related to economic </p><p>restructuring and modernization. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  One opinion expressed by all MPs with whom we spoke </p><p>-- and many political observers and pundits as well -- is </p><p>that the absence of Parliament over the past two and a half </p><p>years created a large hole in Jordanian political discourse, </p><p>and it is good to have Parliament back in session.  What </p><p>remains to be seen is whether the "younger, better educated" </p><p>but still tribal-dominated Parliament will perform better </p><p>then its predecessors, and how the government will cope with </p><p>the exercise of (even just a little) Parliamentary authority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
