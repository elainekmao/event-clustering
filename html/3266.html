SUMMARY: The Public Affairs Section and the Foreign </p><p>Commercial Service of the U.S. Mission in Nigeria organized two </p><p>one-day seminars, June 19-20, in Abuja focusing on the Africa </p><p>Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).  The seminars, "AGOA: </p><p>Participating in Trade," and "Public-Private Partnership for </p><p>Success with AGOA," featured PD-provided speaker Dr. Sharon </p><p>Freeman with Fred Oladeinde and Gregory Simpkins of the </p><p>Washington-based Foundation for Democracy in Africa and Embassy </p><p>Counselor for Commercial Affairs Miguel Pardo de Zela.  The </p><p>interaction of the speakers with the audience, and the audience </p><p>with itself, created a positive dynamic and led to pledges of </p><p>follow up between the GON and private sector.  Audience </p><p>participation included seven Senators from the Committee on </p><p>Economic Affairs;  senior officials of the Nigeria Customs </p><p>Service, Nigerian Investment Promotion Council (NIPC), and </p><p>Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC); officials from </p><p>ministries of commerce and industries at state and federal </p><p>levels, and leading industrialists and textile industry </p><p>representatives from Kano and Kaduna.  The seminars also promoted </p><p>AGOA-related activities including the July 11-12 Seminar in </p><p>Accra, Ghana. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GPRA Data: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: More than 140 policymakers and key </p><p>players in the Nigerian manufacturing sector participated in the </p><p>two days of seminars.  The key speaker for the two sessions, Dr. </p><p>Sharon Freeman, described AGOA and explained its potential to </p><p>enhance growth and productivity.  Dr. Freeman said the failure to </p><p>date to implement textile visas and trans-shipment laws, and poor </p><p>infrastructure, had prevented Nigeria from realizing significant </p><p>benefits from AGOA.  She encouraged the private and public sector </p><p>participants to express their own concerns, and suggested </p><p>possible remedies based on her experience promoting the Caribbean </p><p>Basin Initiative in the 1980s. Oladeinde and Simpkins addressed </p><p>the need for public-private sector interaction.  Pardo de Zela </p><p>discussed the inevitability of globalization, the need for </p><p>Nigerian enterprises to proactively seek out and use available </p><p>information and sources of credit, and described how the Foreign </p><p>Commercial Service could assist businesses wishing to export to </p><p>the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  JUSTIFICATION AND OBJECTIVE: During the two years since AGOA </p><p>became law, Nigeria has made little progress in increasing </p><p>exports to the U.S.  Macroeconomic policies which hamper exports, </p><p>a lack of commitment by the business community, and poor </p><p>infrastructure are among the obstacles to using AGOA to create an </p><p>alternative to petroleum as a source of export earnings.  These </p><p>seminars brought key individuals and institutions together to see </p><p>how these problems might be addressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  DATE: June 19-20, 2002, FY 2002, third quarter </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. MPP UMBRELLA THEME AND AUDIENCE REACHED: Economic Development. </p><p>Over 140 contacts drawn from relevant Nigerian institutions, </p><p>including officials of the Ministry of Commerce, Nigerian Export </p><p>Promotion Council, Nigerian Investment Promotion Council, NEXIM </p><p>Bank, Nigerian Customs Service, elected officials including </p><p>several national legislators and state governors or their </p><p>representatives, and private sector representatives from chambers </p><p>of commerce, major textile manufacturers, exporters, and non- </p><p>governmental organizations engaged in manufacturing attended the </p><p>seminar.  Regular viewers of Nigeria\'s national television, </p><p>estimated to be several million, and those who read newspapers, </p><p>were also part of the audience reached with the AGOA message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. NON-USG SUPPORT: None </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. USG SUPPORT: Excellent.  Post appreciates Washington\'s support </p><p>in making Dr. Freeman available.  The Foreign Commercial Service </p><p>was also of great assistance, as was USAID, which had sponsored </p><p>Oladeinde and Simpkins and his group in their trip to Nigeria. </p><p>Freeman is an articulate speaker.  At Post request, she modified </p><p>her presentation to promote greater dialogue among the </p><p>participants. Her experience in working with Central America gave </p><p>her the authority to convince the audience that they could </p><p>overcome similar problems facing their export sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. MEDIA REACTION: Dr. Freeman gave a 45-minute interview to </p><p>Rhythm Radio, Abuja.  The national TV network, NTA, gave her a </p><p>60-second soundbite.  Lagos-based Vanguard, one of Nigeria\'s </p><p>leading papers, particularly among business readers, ran a three- </p><p>quarter-page interview with Dr. Freeman. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
