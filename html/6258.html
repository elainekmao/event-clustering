<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001516 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH CIVIC SOCIETY: VERDICT SUSPENDED IN CASE </p><p>AGAINST ISLAMIC LEADER FETHULLAH GULEN </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) An Ankara State Security Court (SSC) March 10 ruled </p><p>unanimously to postpone a verdict in the trial in absentia of </p><p>controversial Islamic philosopher Fetullah Gulen.  Gulen, </p><p>indicted in 2000, faced five to 10 years imprisonment under </p><p>the Anti-Terror Law on charges of establishing an illegal </p><p>organization for the purpose of undermining the State and </p><p>establishing Islamist rule.  Under the ruling, the case </p><p>against Gulen will be formally closed if he does not commit </p><p>another felony crime within five years.  If Gulen is charged </p><p>with another crime during that period, the SSC could </p><p>reactivate this case and issue a verdict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Gulen attorney Hasan Gunaydin speculated that the SSC </p><p>postponed the verdict because the evidence in the case was </p><p>not strong enough to justify a conviction.  He told Emboffs </p><p>that he and his colleagues are seeking a full acquittal in </p><p>the case, and have filed an objection to the ruling.  If the </p><p>SSC refuses to revise its ruling, Gunaydin said he will file </p><p>an appeal.  He did not know whether Gulen, who now resides in </p><p>the U.S., plans to return to Turkey as a result of the </p><p>ruling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Gulen, much more militant when he began in the early </p><p>1970\'s, is the spiritual leader of an Islamic movement that </p><p>officially professes to be interested in ecumenical </p><p>understanding but whose roots are intensely Islamic.  The </p><p>movement works in the manner of other Islamic tarikats </p><p>(brotherhoods) but is relatively more hierarchical and </p><p>disciplined.  Gulen and his followers have contacts with, and </p><p>have received public support from, a varied range of Turkish </p><p>politicians, including former President Demirel and </p><p>arch-secularist-nationalist former P.M. Ecevit.  Gulen has </p><p>warm relations with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and Pope </p><p>John Paul II.  His followers have the reputation of being </p><p>truer to their word in dealings with people of other faiths </p><p>than their main rivals (Islamist former P.M. Necmettin </p><p>Erbakan\'s Milli Gorus (National View) movement and some </p><p>elements of the Nakshibendi tarikats, both of whom form the </p><p>core of now-ruling AK Party), for whom lying in the service </p><p>of their faith in dealings with non-Muslims is meritorious in </p><p>Allah\'s sight ("sevap").  The Gulen movement\'s wide network </p><p>of secondary schools, universities, media outlets, business </p><p>associations, and other holdings in 35 countries was </p><p>originally encouraged by the GOT, especially the MFA and </p><p>intel services, but the Kemalist State, especially the </p><p>Turkish military, defined the Gulenists as an Islamist threat </p><p>in the wake of the military\'s 1997 "post-modern" coup against </p><p>Erbakan\'s Islamist government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Gulen\'s harassment by the State appears to us </p><p>to be based on an unclear and arbitrarily-interpreted range </p><p>of evidence, although in our experience the movement in </p><p>Turkey has become secretive under the State\'s pressure, its </p><p>representatives are cagier with us, and its goals are </p><p>therefore more difficult to read.  In addition, we have </p><p>experience that more militant Islamists have moved into some </p><p>of the Gulen structures in Turkey.  Yet based on extensive </p><p>and continuing contacts with Gulenists, we conclude that </p><p>Gulen\'s approach is so gradualist, and his chief lieutenants </p><p>are so wary of being tarred as militants, that the movement </p><p>does not pose a clear and present danger to the State. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
