<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000523 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, HR, AL, MK, HR, AL, MK, IZ, IZPREL, NATO, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: "ADRIATIC 3" FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING, DUBROVNIK, </p><p>MARCH 7:  SUPPORTIVE STATEMENT ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. NARDI/ROSSIN EMAIL 3/5 </p><p>     B. ROSSIN/NARDI TELCON 3/7 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMB. LAWRENCE ROSSIN, </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE ALBANIAN, CROATIAN AND MACEDONIAN FOREIGN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00523  01 OF 02  111302Z </p><p>MINISTERS MET BRIEFLY IN DUBROVNIK MARCH 7 TO CONFIRM THE </p><p>"ADRIATIC CHARTER" DRAFT TEXT (ALREADY WITH DEPARTMENT), </p><p>ISSUE A DECLARATION AND GIVE THE INITIATIVE HIGHER PUBLIC </p><p>PROFILE.  AMBASSADOR ROSSIN ATTENDED FOR THE  USG AT FM </p><p>PICULA\'S INVITATION AND PARTICIPATED IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>AFTERWARD.  TEXT OF MINISTERS\' DECLARATION, WITH REASONABLY </p><p>FIRM IRAQ LANGUAGE, AT PARA 9 (FAXED TO EUR/SCE).  WE CREDIT </p><p>ALBANIAN FM META FOR ENSURING THE IRAQ LANGUAGE WAS INCLUDED </p><p>IN THE FINAL TEXT.  ALTHOUGH THE CROATIANS POSE LESS </p><p>RESISTANCE THAN AT PREVIOUS A3 MEETINGS, AMBASSADOR OVERHEARD </p><p>THE CROATIAN LEAD OFFICIALS TRYING TO MINIMIZE IT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN THE CONFERENCE AND AT THE PRESS EVENT, ALL THREE </p><p>MINISTERS STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF, AND THEIR GRATITUDE </p><p>FOR, USG "PARTNERSHIP" IN ADVANCING THEIR NATO ASPIRATIONS, </p><p>AND UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADRIATIC CHARTER AS </p><p>PROOF POSITIVE OF OUR COMMITMENT.  ALL LOOKED FORWARD TO </p><p>SIGNING WITH SECRETARY POWELL IN WASHINGTON. PER REF A, </p><p>AMBASSADOR TOLD THE MINISTERS THAT A SIGNING CEREMONY IN </p><p>MARCH WAS UNLIKELY AND NOTED THAT THE CHARTER TEXT WAS UNDER </p><p>REVIEW IN WASHINGTON, WITH SOME WORDING CHANGES POSSIBLE </p><p>SOON.  THE MINISTERS UNDERSTOOD THAT MARCH WAS HARD TO </p><p>PROGRAM BUT URGED THAT SIGNING NOT BE ALLOWED TO SLIP TOO </p><p>LONG.  PER REF B, DEPARTMENT\'S PROPOSED CHANGES IN CHARTER </p><p>WORDING SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE THREE WASHINGTON </p><p>AMBASSADORS FOR A3 CONSIDERATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE FOREIGN MINISTERS A3 MEETING MARCH 7 IN DUBROVNIK </p><p>LASTED 45 MINUTES, WITH AMBASSADOR ROSSIN INVITED TO JOIN IN </p><p>ALL BUT THE FIRST TEN MINUTES.  DISCUSSION DURING THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S PRESENCE WAS RATHER PERFUNCTORY (THE DECLARATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00523  01 OF 02  111302Z </p><p>AND DRAFT CHARTER HAVING BEEN COMPLETED BEFOREHAND) WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF MINOR TENSION WHEN ALBANIAN FM META COMPLAINED </p><p>TO CROATIAN FM PICULA ABOUT TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON ALBANIANS </p><p>COMING TO CROATIA.  PICULA DWELT ON CROATIA\'S NATO AND EU </p><p>ASPIRATIONS AND PROGRESS AND STRESSED ITS INTEREST IN </p><p>REGIONAL COOPERATION.  MACEDONIAN FM MITREVA EMPHASIZED </p><p>PRACTICAL COOPERATION, MENTIONED IN THE ADRIATIC CHARTER, ON </p><p>ISSUES SUCH AS BORDER SECURITY, TRAFFICKING AND ECONOMIC </p><p>COOPERATION.  SHE TOUTED THE MAY BORDER CONFERENCE IN OHRID </p><p>(SKOPJE 313). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) META SIMILARLY STRESSED ALBANIA\'S INTEREST IN REGIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION BUT ALSO NOTED THE NEED FOR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE SO THESE COUNTRIES COULD ATTAIN NATO AND EU </p><p>STANDARDS IN A REASONABLE TIME.  META EMPHASIZED AT LENGTH </p><p>ALBANIAN SOLIDARITY WITH THE U.S. ON IRAQ, COMPARING SADDAM\'S </p><p>REGIME WITH THE SOCIALIST ISOLATION HIS COUNTRY SUFFERED FOR </p><p>50 YEARS.  ALL THREE MINISTERS WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO </p><p>UNDERSCORE THEIR APPRECIATION FOR USG SUPPORT, NOT ONLY ON </p><p>THE ADRIATIC CHARTER, THE OPEN DOOR AND THEIR NATO </p><p>CANDIDACIES, BUT ALSO ON THE FULL RANGE OF THEIR ASPIRATIONS </p><p>AND CHALLENGES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED IN HIS TURN U.S. COMMITMENT TO </p><p>THE OPEN DOOR AND TO ASSIST THE THREE COUNTRIES IN MAKING </p><p>THEIR NATO ASPIRATIONS REAL THROUGH THEIR MAP PROGRAMS. </p><p>WHILE EACH COUNTRY FACED DIFFERENT DEFENSE REFORMS, </p><p>INTEROPERABILITY AND CIVIL SOCIETY CHALLENGES TO QUALIFY FOR </p><p>INVITATIONS, NATO WAS ALL ABOUT COLLABORATION, AND THEREFORE </p><p>WE APPLAUDED THEIR INITIATIVE IN TEAMING TOGETHER THROUGH </p><p>THIS ADRIATIC PROCESS, NOT JUST WITH HORTATORY LANGUAGE BUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00523  01 OF 02  111302Z </p><p>WITH CONCRETE PLANS.  AMBASSADOR TOLD THE MINISTERS THAT THE </p><p>DRAFT CHARTER TEXT WAS BEING REVIEWED IN WASHINGTON AND WE </p><p>APPLAUDED ITS OVERALL TONE AND PROVISIONS; WE EXPECTED TO </p><p>PROPOSE SOME MINOR WORDING CHANGES IN DUE COURSE.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM A WASHINGTON SIGNING DATE YET AND </p><p>MARCH LOOKED UNLIKELY, WE WOULD BE IN TOUCH SOON AND REMAINED </p><p>COMMITTED TO AN EARLY SIGNING CEREMONY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FINALLY, WHILE NOTING THAT THE USG WOULD WELCOME THE </p><p>ADRIATIC INITIATIVE AND DUBROVNIK DECLARATION AS A WHOLE, WE </p><p>ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED THE DECLARATION\'S REITERATION OF </p><p>IRAQ\'S OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH UNSCR 1441 "OR FACE THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES."  SUCH SOLIDARITY WAS ESSENTIAL TO MAXIMIZE </p><p>PRESSURE ON SADDAM TO COMPLY AND AVOID THE NEED FOR USE OF </p><p>FORCE TO DISARM IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE MINISTERS UNDERSTOOD THE UNCERTAINTY IN SCHEDULING </p><p>THE WASHINGTON SIGNING CEREMONY BUT URGED THAT IT NOT BE </p><p>DELAYED TOO LONG.  MACEDONIAN FM MITREVA WAS STRONGEST ON </p><p>THIS POINT; SHE INDICATED SHE HAD HEARD THAT DELAY UNTIL MAY </p><p>WAS BEING CONSIDERED AND SAID THAT WOULD DISSIPATE THE </p><p>PROGRESS MADE BY THE THREE.  AMBASSADOR ASSURED HER WE WOULD </p><p>MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SCHEDULE THE SIGNING CEREMONY AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE AND DISCOUNTED WHAT SHE HAD HEARD. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2144 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00523  02 OF 02  111303Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   DCP-01   NRRC-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     SSR-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------4264FC  111303Z /38 </p><p>R 111250Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9652 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000523 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NATO, HR, AL, MK, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: "ADRIATIC 3" FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING, DUBROVNIK, </p><p>MARCH 7:  SUPPORTIVE STATEMENT ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, EACH OF THE MINISTERS AND THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ECHOED THEMES FROM THE MINISTERIAL; ALL THE </p><p>MINISTERS THANKED THE USG PUBLICLY FOR ITS "PARTNERSHIP" IN </p><p>THE A3 ENTERPRISE.  AS IN PRIVATE, FM META WAS STRONGEST ON </p><p>IRAQ.  IN TYPICAL CROATIAN FASHION, ONLY ONE JOURNALIST ASKED </p><p>A QUESTION, WHICH PICULA HANDLED WELL.  IN COMMENTS AFTERWARD </p><p>TO CROATIAN JOURNALISTS, PICULA SPUN THE DECLARATION TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00523  02 OF 02  111303Z </p><p>ASSURE THE HOME AUDIENCE THAT WHILE SADDAM HAD TO COMPLY, THE </p><p>GOC REMAINED FOCUSED ON A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE IRAQ </p><p>CRISIS.  (TYPICALLY, PICULA ENSURED THAT THE GOC WAS </p><p>FOLLOWING RATHER THAN LEADING PUBLIC OPINION ON IRAQ.) </p><p> </p><p>9.
