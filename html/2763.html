ABUJA 1068 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 829 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 1091 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 1159 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews.  Reason:  1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: From the perspective of recent history, the </p><p>processions of sycophantic visitors and Obasanjo\'s own words </p><p>strongly suggest Nigeria\'s President will seek a second term. </p><p> At a minimum, Obasanjo boosters seek to pre-empt anyone else </p><p>contemplating a run -- the better to assure continued access </p><p>to the public trough where they greedily feed.  The political </p><p>show of force intends to impress upon potential opponents and </p><p>their possible allies the costs of confronting the incumbent. </p><p> But despite an increasing tendency toward isolating himself, </p><p>Obasanjo knows his Administration has not delivered much to </p><p>the average Nigerian and that sycophancy does not demonstrate </p><p>popularity.  There is still a small chance he\'ll say, "No." </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>WHATEVER SUITS YOUR SYCOPHANCY </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The orchestrated visit to President Obasanjo\'s Ota </p><p>Farm the Tuesday after Easter (ref A) by 20 governors and a </p><p>score or so of other political figures continues to generate </p><p>controversy.  Political cartoons show the same archetypal </p><p>political elites who pleaded with Abacha to run in 1998 now </p><p>imploring Obasanjo to seek a second term.  "ThisDay" ginned </p><p>up a merged photo (half Abacha/half Obasanjo) to accompany a </p><p>column on the similarities between Abacha\'s self-succession </p><p>plans and the growing Obasanjo-is-indispensable movement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) While those angered by the event have dubbed it an </p><p>"unholy pilgrimage by sycophants" who were acting out a "Sani </p><p>Abacha script," Obasanjo\'s supporters are asking questions, a </p><p>notable one being: if the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) is </p><p>free to campaign openly against Obasanjo running for a second </p><p>term, why should his supporters not step out to openly and </p><p>resolutely prevail on him to run? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) What apparently galls many Nigerians is that both </p><p>Obasanjo and his supporters are trying to show the world that </p><p>it is not he that wants to continue as the President, rather </p><p>that Nigerians who have anointed him as a political Messiah. </p><p>The 14-day fast (Ref A) that ends today and OO\'s frequent </p><p>references to a need for divine guidance inject a spiritual </p><p>element intended to resonate with Nigeria\'s deeply religious </p><p>masses but which deepens the cynicism of commentators, who </p><p>note that Abacha did much the same thing in 1998.  Obasanjo\'s </p><p>boosters are not talking about his achievements as a basis </p><p>for seeking reelection.  They are, in effect, saying that </p><p>there is no alternative to Obasanjo -- a sycophantic, </p><p>unimaginative card that makes the Presidency look rather </p><p>cheap.  Perennial Information Minister Jerry Gana </p><p>disingenuously claimed that the April 2 event did not amount </p><p>to clearing the way for Obasanjo to emerge as the sole </p><p>candidate and that the presidential race was still open, even </p><p>in the President\'s party, the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) However, sources tell us, Works and Housing Minister </p><p>Tony Anenih made it clear that governors who declined to join </p><p>the parade at Ota should expect the Obasanjo Administration </p><p>to deploy its powers against them.  For Abubakar Audu of </p><p>Kogi, facing scrutiny over residential real estate purchases </p><p>in London and Potomac, being from the opposition All Peoples </p><p>Party was not enough to keep him away from Ota.  Writing in </p><p>"ThisDay", Olusegun Adeniyi commented, "What...bothers me is </p><p>the total lack of creativity that Obasanjo\'s undertakers have </p><p>shown in recent weeks.  Must they do it the Abacha way?  This </p><p>lack of creativity may also tellingly reveal to us why these </p><p>public office holders have not been able to achieve anything </p><p>tangible in three years.  They have no fresh ideas, even for </p><p>manipulating people and elections."  Separately, an Obasanjo </p><p>confidant told us that someone might be paid to run against </p><p>the President in order to preserve the appearance of an open </p><p>race.  If attempted, it would not be a new concept; Ibrahim </p><p>Babangida reportedly provided money to both Moshood Abiola </p><p>and Bashir Tofa to finance their 1993 presidential campaigns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------AN HISTORICAL COUNTERPOINT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) In 1956, Western Region premier Chief Obafemi Awolowo </p><p>faced some of the re-election challenges that confront Chief </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo today.  According to Akpo Esajere of the </p><p>"Guardian", Awo did not tell people to go and pray or that he </p><p>was seeking divine guidance to know if he should re-contest. </p><p>Instead, the sage quietly mobilized his lieutenants.  When he </p><p>stepped into the open, he enumerated what he had achieved and </p><p>what more he would do.  The campaign not only highlighted his </p><p>achievements, it sought to knock the bottom out of the case </p><p>of his opponents, in that it carefully detailed how he would </p><p>move the region forward from the point to which he had taken </p><p>it.  It was a confident campaign whose persuasive edges would </p><p>seem more useful to Obasanjo than allowing professional </p><p>politicians to come and beg him to run for another term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>TRIED AND TRUE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The events of April 2 serve to remind observers not </p><p>only of parallels with Abacha in 1998, but also of OO\'s </p><p>actions prior to deciding to run in 1999.  In 1998 after his </p><p>release from prison, Obasanjo claimed to have no desire to </p><p>run for President, and it was rumored that this refusal to </p><p>contest was part of the bargain that granted his release. </p><p>But within weeks, he had received several leading Southwest </p><p>politicians, including the current Internal Affairs Minister, </p><p>Chief Sunday Afolabi, who begged him to seek the Presidency. </p><p>Obasanjo was reported as having said that if Nigerians wanted </p><p>him to become President, he was left with no choice but to </p><p>seek divine direction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The President is now using pretty much the same </p><p>tactic, except that perhaps that "begging" him to come and </p><p>run is this time being done on a large scale, the idea being </p><p>that the "Messiah" air should be brought home as forcefully </p><p>as his campaign machinery can make possible, in hopes, </p><p>perhaps, of intimidating all possible opposition with this </p><p>manifestation of the power of incumbency.  Visits to Aso </p><p>Villa or Ota to "persuade" Obasanjo are part of a larger </p><p>strategy.  Different "independent" campaign groups have been </p><p>created, notably Coalition 2003, Obasanjo Solidarity Forum, </p><p>Vote Obasanjo/Atiku (VOA), Leadership Front, Alliance for </p><p>Obasanjo and Atiku and others.  The PDP women\'s forum, led by </p><p>Josephine Anenih, wife of Tony Anenih went to Aso Rock to </p><p>plead with the President.  Earlier, the women\'s arm of the </p><p>Obasanjo Solidarity Forum was also admitted into the Villa to </p><p>plead. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Aside from the Ota event, Anenih had been active in </p><p>efforts to make the President\'s re-election a fait accompli. </p><p>He recently led a delegation comprising the governors of </p><p>Rivers, Cross River and Bayelsa states, as well as some top </p><p>party chiefs from the South-South zone, to Aso Rock.  The </p><p>path was well-trod; Anenih had been prominent among those </p><p>political figures who in 1998 averred that Nigeria could not </p><p>survive without Abacha.  Not to be left out, Chief Solomon </p><p>Lar in late March led PDP figures from the North-Central zone </p><p>to Aso Villa to plead with Obasanjo to re-contest.  Lar was </p><p>Police Affairs Minister under Abacha until a falling-out sent </p><p>him home to Langtang; he later emerged as the first chairman </p><p>of the PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) To all these, Obasanjo had given a standard </p><p>response, except that on April 2, he notched the stakes a bit </p><p>higher.  His words -- "I have been touched to the point of </p><p>emotion, to the point of sentimentality.  When you have this </p><p>type of gathering uninstigated by me, unsolicited, as genuine </p><p>as it is, one cannot but feel touched, because what else does </p><p>one want in life except to serve humanity and serve God" -- </p><p>were in character and according to script, even though they </p><p>struck a discordant note with many sophisticated Nigerians, </p><p>and even with some assumed to lack sophistication.  Cynicism </p><p>about the pleaders not only runs deep, but increasingly wide. </p><p> As one Embassy driver succinctly put it, "They just want to </p><p>keep eating our money." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THE PERSPECTIVE FROM "ABROAD" </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) In his administration, which clocks three years in </p><p>late May, Obasanjo has made 90 trips abroad.  However, the </p><p>benefits of the trips are unclear to many Nigerians.  Despite </p><p>all the travel, Obasanjo has not obtained the painless debt </p><p>cancellation he so avidly seeks, nor are foreign companies </p><p>(other than South Africans) interested in investing in the </p><p>non-oil sector.  Recently, Investors International London, </p><p>Limited (IIL) was unable to raise the funds needed to buy 51 </p><p>percent of GON-owned Nigeria Telecommunications (NITEL) and </p><p>seems likely to lose its deposit, casting a further pall over </p><p>Nigeria\'s privatization exercise.  Nigerian elites are deeply </p><p>ambivalent about privatization, anyway.  They complain about </p><p>foreigners buying the "national patrimony" for less than its </p><p>"true" value (there is particular unhappiness with the South </p><p>Africans) but are just as bitter that privatization has </p><p>produced little net inflow of foreign direct investment. </p><p>12.  (U) Nigerian elites are equally confused about the roles </p><p>being played by some of Nigeria\'s key international partners. </p><p> Noting that "Western countries especially America and </p><p>Britain are said to be unsatisfied with the Obasanjo </p><p>administration\'s performance in fighting corruption, battling </p><p>the scepter (sic) of insecurity and stabilizing the polity </p><p>and the economy," Esajere sees the hands of Washington and </p><p>London trying to guide Obasanjo to eschew a second term: </p><p>"About nine months ago, when Obasanjo\'s administration was a </p><p>little over two years, a campaign suddenly came out that the </p><p>President should play Nelson Mandela or take to the path of </p><p>the biblical John the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus </p><p>Christ.  Foreign diplomats are said to be behind the </p><p>campaign, which has put enormous pressures on Obasanjo." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Satisfied with his own analysis, Esajere concludes </p><p>that Obasanjo should have "actively created a successor who </p><p>(could) stabilize the polity.  But Obasanjo is not one to </p><p>willingly and selflessly give his blessing to a young man as </p><p>Mandela did with President Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.  Can </p><p>Obasanjo play John the Baptist, talking about \'one among </p><p>you?\'  He is most unlikely to do that," Esajere concludes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) While we do not share Esajere\'s conviction that the </p><p>US and the UK actively seek to have Obasanjo remove himself </p><p>from the 2003 campaign, we agree with the view that Nigeria\'s </p><p>President is temperamentally disinclined to choose a strong </p><p>successor -- if choose a successor he someday must.  For now, </p><p>the staged visits presume continuity rather than succession. </p><p>Those who would counsel Obasanjo to retire (such as Abraham </p><p>Adesanya, Sunday Awoniyi, Isyaku Ibrahim and Abdulkadir Kure) </p><p>or at least to dispense with the theatrics are not invited </p><p>into his presence.  By all accounts and based on our own </p><p>experience (ref C), Obasanjo is becoming steadily less </p><p>willing to listen to dissenting points of view.  Indeed, he </p><p>feeds the sycophancy Anenih and others engendered, producing </p><p>in his own mind a much rosier image of his performance and </p><p>popularity than is shared by many influential fellow </p><p>citizens.  According to Esajere, Obasanjo is also "trying to </p><p>show the skeptical external world that it is not him that </p><p>wants to be president; it is Nigerians who want him, who have </p><p>anointed him as Messiah." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WHERE ARE THE ALTERNATIVES? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Many Nigerians despair that the country is on the </p><p>road to a de facto single-party system.  Obasanjo\'s public </p><p>comment that he shared some of the concerns of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>Mugabe is read in light of Nigerian domestic politics rather </p><p>than the issues affecting Zimbabwe today.  Leaders of the </p><p>unregistered parties believe that State House is intent upon </p><p>keeping them out of the 2003 contest.  Alh. Saleh Jambo, </p><p>pro-tem Chairman of the United Nigeria Democratic Party </p><p>(UNDP) told us recently that he found Obasanjo\'s expressed </p><p>sympathy for the Zimbabwean leader a matter of great concern. </p><p> The deepening conflict over the local government polls, </p><p>notably their timing, the status of voter registers and the </p><p>role of the unregistered parties, further muddies electoral </p><p>waters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) The APP and the AD joined forces to put up a joint </p><p>candidate (Olu Falae) in the 1999 Presidential elections. </p><p>The two parties did well in gubernatorial elections in the </p><p>North (APP) and the Southwest (AD).  But both parties are </p><p>beset by factionalism (Ref B), and at-risk governors </p><p>(particularly from the APP) are lining up with Obasanjo while </p><p>remaining formally within their parties.  Adamu Aliero of </p><p>Kebbi is said to have explained that, just as one is </p><p>instructed to fasten one\'s own oxygen mask before that of a </p><p>child, so, too, the governor must save himself if he is to </p><p>obtain benefits for his people.  Such unabashed opportunism </p><p>pervades the political class and is both curse and blessing. </p><p>It militates against the establishment of interest-based </p><p>politics (a basic element of viable democracy), but it also </p><p>discourages politicians from standing on principle when the </p><p>wind is clearly blowing in another direction (thereby </p><p>reducing the chances of an enduring political crisis). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) Notwithstanding Anenih\'s infamous "no vacancy" line, </p><p>there is no shortage of people who would like to move into </p><p>Aso Villa.  By all accounts, Babangida is particularly intent </p><p>upon salvaging his tattered reputation by winning the </p><p>presidency, if not in 2003 then certainly four years later. </p><p>However, he (and all other contenders) must assess their </p><p>prospects.  The fact that Obasanjo has remarkably little to </p><p>offer the average Nigerian as proof of his leadership and </p><p>stewardship over the past three years does not nullify his </p><p>hopes for a second term.  He simply needs to pre-empt likely </p><p>antagonists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) Here lies the genius of organized sycophancy; it </p><p>constitutes a political show of force.  The point is not to </p><p>convince a "skeptical external world" that Nigerians want OO </p><p>for another fours years.  Anenih is far too calculating and </p><p>experienced to think foreigners unable to see through such a </p><p>contrivance.  Calling on the troops to endorse the leader for </p><p>another term is typical in any democracy; the extent to which </p><p>they comply is a good test of the leader\'s popularity.  What </p><p>is different about Nigeria today (and unsettlingly similar to </p><p>Nigeria in 1998) is the leader\'s seeming need to say he is </p><p>being "called" (by God and/or the people).  Whether this </p><p>flows from a need to gratify the ego, or is a cynical view of </p><p>the electorate\'s sophistication is anyone\'s guess.  Either </p><p>way, inveigling or coercing opposition politicians to join </p><p>the calls for four more years adds to the punch, leaving </p><p>potential opposing candidates off-balance and uncertain about </p><p>the likely costs of contesting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS... </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) ...Obasanjo will decide whether or not to seek a </p><p>second term.  All outward signs continue to point to "yes," </p><p>but the outward signs are largely of his boosters\' making. </p><p>His own pronouncements suggest a strong inclination to run </p><p>again, but there remains a small chance he might say, "no." </p><p>Despite his frequent travels abroad, too much time spent in </p><p>Abuja while in Nigeria and an increasing tendency to brush </p><p>aside advice running contrary to his own views, Obasanjo is </p><p>too intelligent not to realize how little his Administration </p><p>has accomplished for the average Nigerian -- and how quickly </p><p>the sychophants can find new heroes.  The fast ends tomorrow. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
