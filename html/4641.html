(C) Summary and comment:  The GOT denies recent press </p><p>reports that suggest new developments on the Turkey-Iraq gas </p><p>project.  Although the MFA previously told us a 1997 </p><p>Turkey-Iraq protocol on natural gas was null and void, BOTAS </p><p>claims the protocol still exists, and was discussed as </p><p>recently as July 2002.  The MFA maintains that a change in </p><p>Iraq would not affect the gas picture in Turkey; however, </p><p>BOTAS General Manager Bildaci believes that, if Iraqi gas </p><p>becomes available any time soon, it could affect Shah Deniz. </p><p>As the Shah Deniz gas project continues to be delayed, and </p><p>the prospect of an Iraq post-sanctions appears more </p><p>conceivable to the Turks, it is likely that Iraqi gas is </p><p>playing into the GOT\'s -- and BP\'s -- calculations.  We </p><p>believe that ultimately Turkey\'s commitment to the East-West </p><p>Energy Corridor and to its Caspian neighbors will prevail, </p><p>and it will hold up its end of the bargain on Shah Deniz. </p><p>However, we would be more convinced that a change in Iraq </p><p>would not affect Shah Deniz if the project were sanctioned </p><p>and construction underway -- yet another reason to continue </p><p>our push with all parties to move to sanction as soon as </p><p>possible.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOT Denies Progress on Iraq Gas Deal, Speculates on Future </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) There have been several press reports over the last </p><p>few weeks quoting a "top Iraqi oil official" as saying that </p><p>Iraq is seeking to become the "main gas exporter" to Turkey. </p><p>MFA Deputy Director General for Energy Hakki Akil, BOTAS </p><p>General Manager Bildaci, and TPAO officials have all </p><p>confirmed to us that there have been no recent discussions or </p><p>developments on the Turkey-Iraq gas project.  (Note:  Turkey </p><p>and Iraq signed in May 1997 a protocol for the export of </p><p>natural gas to Turkey.  See paras 8-9 for a history of the </p><p>project).  Views differ, however, as to potential progress on </p><p>this deal in an Iraq post-sanctions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MFA Deputy DG Akil told us that change in Iraq would </p><p>not affect the gas picture in Turkey; in particular, he said, </p><p>it would not affect the government\'s commitment to the Shah </p><p>Deniz gas pipeline.  Akil claimed that the GOT had never </p><p>envisioned Iraqi gas for the Turkish market; therefore, even </p><p>if it suddenly became available at a good price, it would not </p><p>be competing with Shah Deniz gas. </p><p>4. (C) BOTAS General Manager Bildaci (strictly protect) </p><p>provided a different view.  Bildaci noted that Iraqi gas from </p><p>an Iraq post-sanctions would be significantly cheaper than </p><p>any gas Turkey is currently importing; therefore, if that gas </p><p>became available in the very near future, it certainly had </p><p>the potential to affect projects like Shah Deniz.  A TPAO </p><p>official told us that, while there had been no recent </p><p>progress on talks with Iraq, they were "keeping the channels </p><p>of communication open." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A BP executive told econoff that Iraq is not figuring </p><p>into BP\'s planning on Shah Deniz at this point because BP </p><p>believed that Turkey 1) had no space for Iraqi gas; and 2) </p><p>was committed to Shah Deniz.  A February 2002 internal BP </p><p>report on gas in Turkey states that "by the time Saddam </p><p>Hussein goes, Turkey could be fully supplied by other gas </p><p>importers . . . the about-turn on policy will come when </p><p>Saddam Hussein goes and the UN embargo is lifted; there will </p><p>be enormous pressure on Turkey to increase trade with Iraq by </p><p>re-opening the Kirkuk-Ceyhan oil pipeline and very quickly </p><p>putting gas back on the agenda, although there will be more </p><p>words than action."  (Note:  the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline is </p><p>open and being used to transport oil under the oil-for-food </p><p>program). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraqi Gas, Shah Deniz and Turkey\'s Supply/Demand </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>6. (C) Industry analysts estimate that, given Turkey\'s </p><p>existing gas contracts (including Shah Deniz), it will need </p><p>to increase gas imports starting in 2012.  This estimate </p><p>assumes medium demand/growth, exports to Greece of 2 bcm </p><p>annually, and Turkey purchasing all contracted gas at the </p><p>take-or-pay levels.  Under this scenario, the Turkish </p><p>government (or private companies, in a liberalized market) </p><p>would not be in a position to sign new gas contracts for six </p><p>to eight years.  However, if inexpensive Iraqi gas became </p><p>available before that, BOTAS could try to renegotiate some of </p><p>its more expensive gas contracts, particularly with Russia, </p><p>to lower prices or to create space for Iraqi gas.  As </p><p>reported in ref A, BOTAS is currently paying, or will pay, </p><p>the following amounts for its imported gas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gas Contract      USD per thousand cubic meters </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Russia West 1       130 </p><p>Russia West 2       134 </p><p>Blue Stream      132 </p><p>Iran                123 </p><p>Shah Deniz           95.5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Assuming that Shah Deniz has been sanctioned and has </p><p>entered the construction phase, BOTAS would be less likely to </p><p>try to renegotiate that contract.  As reported ref B, </p><p>Turkey\'s powerful National Security Council has strongly </p><p>endorsed the Shah Deniz pipeline.  Senior Ministry of Energy </p><p>and MFA officials recognize that construction of Shah Deniz </p><p>enhances Turkey\'s national security by diversifying its </p><p>energy supply, solidifying its role in the East-West Energy </p><p>Corridor, and helping to ensure the prosperity and stability </p><p>of its Caspian neighbors.  Just as these officials did not </p><p>try to renegotiate the Shah Deniz contract when Turkey\'s gas </p><p>oversupply problem became apparent in early 2002 (ref c), </p><p>they likely will look to other contracts first if cheap Iraqi </p><p>gas becomes available.  The Shah Deniz project is governed by </p><p>an Intergovernmental Agreement with an important ally, will </p><p>provide Turkey\'s cheapest gas, and is considered by many to </p><p>be critical to completion of the BTC oil pipeline.  If, </p><p>however, Iraqi gas became available before Shah Deniz was </p><p>sanctioned and construction underway, the equation could </p><p>change. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>History of the Turkey-Iraq Natural Gas Project </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) BOTAS provided us the following history of the </p><p>Turkey-Iraq Natural Gas Project: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>March \'96:  Turkish Ministry of Energy (MENR) and Iraqi </p><p>Ministry of Oil sign a Memorandum of Understanding for the </p><p>natural gas export project. </p><p>May \'97:    Turkish and Iraqi Energy Ministers sign the </p><p>"Agreement on Iraq Natural Gas Exports to Turkey."  BOTAS, </p><p>the Turkish Petroleum Agency (TPAO), and Tekfen, a large </p><p>Turkish holding company, sign the "Agreement for a Project of </p><p>Mutual Interest," creating the consortium that would develop </p><p>the gas pipeline project in Turkey. </p><p>June \'98:   Iraq-Turkey Joint Working Group agrees on a </p><p>feasibility report. </p><p>July \'98:   Presentation made to foreign companies willing to </p><p>participate in the project.  Gaz de France is later nominated </p><p>to be the organizing company for other oil/gas companies\' </p><p>participation in midstream.  ENI-Agip is nominated to be the </p><p>organizing company for other oil/gas companies\' participation </p><p>in upstream. </p><p>June \'01:   During the 13th Session of the Joint Economic </p><p>Commission between Turkey and Iraq, both sides agree to hold </p><p>discussions in order to reactivate the project by </p><p>re-identifying new roles of the Turkish firms within the </p><p>scope of the new gas market law. </p><p>July \'02:   During the 14th Session of the Joint Economic </p><p>Commission between Turkey and Iraq, both sides agree to take </p><p>the necessary steps for the realization of the "Iraqi Gas </p><p>Export Project to Turkey and Europe" with an "integrated </p><p>project approach," and "taking into consideration the future </p><p>gas demand in Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Other sources claim that, according to the May 1997 </p><p>agreement, Turkey would purchase 10 bcm of gas per year from </p><p>Iraq for a 20 year period.  MFA Deputy DG for Energy Akil </p><p>told us in July 2001 (ref d) that, with the enactment of the </p><p>new natural gas law in June 2001, BOTAS no longer had the </p><p>authority to enter into new contractual arrangements for the </p><p>import of gas.  Therefore, Akil said, the GOT had informed </p><p>Iraq that the 1997 protocol was null and void with the </p><p>passage of the new gas law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Although press reports regarding new developments on </p><p>the Turkey-Iraq gas project appear to be false, progress on </p><p>this deal becomes more likely with an Iraq post-sanctions. </p><p>We believe that ultimately Turkey\'s commitment to the </p><p>East-West Energy Corridor and to its Caspian neighbors will </p><p>outweigh other considerations, and -- particularly once the </p><p>project is sanctioned -- Turkey will hold up its end of the </p><p>bargain on Shah Deniz.  However, we would be more convinced </p><p>that a change in Iraq would not affect Shah Deniz if the </p><p>project were sanctioned and construction underway -- yet </p><p>another reason to continue our push with all parties to move </p><p>to sanction as soon as possible. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
