<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001863 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EMIN, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BREDENKAMP CONSULTANT DISCUSSES HIS PROMINENT </p><p>CLIENT\'S BUSINESS DEAL (C-NA2-00908) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Laboff KRBel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On August 15, Laboff met with a local economist and </p><p>John Hollaway (protect), a Zimbabwean mining consultant, to </p><p>discuss potential economic lifelines available to the GOZ </p><p>through development of platinum resources.  As expected, </p><p>Hollaway believes that any sizable expansion of the platinum </p><p>mines will depend heavily upon outside investment, which is </p><p>not very likely given the dismal investment climate as well </p><p>as the perennial rumors of nationalization/ indigenization of </p><p>the Zimbabwean mining industry.  Hollaway has agreed to </p><p>facilitate a visit to one of the platinum mines for Laboff </p><p>and DCM in order to get a better feel for the situation on </p><p>the ground. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Hollaway was returning from a trip to the Democratic </p><p>Republic of Congo (DRC), where he has been working as a </p><p>consultant for wealthy Zimbabwean businessman John </p><p>Bredenkamp, who has long enjoyed a cozy relationship with the </p><p>Mugabe government.  According to Hollaway, Bredenkamp is </p><p>disenchanted with his investments in one of the world\'s </p><p>richest cobalt deposits located in the DRC, where he has </p><p>recently spent over US$24 million with no profit in sight. </p><p>Hollaway noted that mining is a capital-intensive, long-term </p><p>investment, which contrasts with many of Bredenkamp\'s other </p><p>ventures in such businesses as oil, weapons, and land, which </p><p>tend to produce more immediate profits.  In a business </p><p>venture which Hollaway requested that Post keep confidential, </p><p>he is currently investigating whether a failed Zimbabwean </p><p>platinum refining unit can be retrofitted in order to refine </p><p>cobalt mined from the DRC deposit. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hollaway also mentioned that he had the opportunity to </p><p>speak with some of the Zimbabwean soldiers while on </p><p>assignment in the DRC.  In what he characterized as "about a </p><p>dozen highly discreet conversations" with non-commissioned </p><p>officers and lower level commissioned officers, Hollaway </p><p>discerned more than a little discontent.  According to </p><p>Hollaway, the soldiers expressed frustration at being used as </p><p>pawns as well as a fairly widespread lack of interest in </p><p>being Zanu-PF lackeys.  Although there is extensive talk of </p><p>Zimbabwe looting the resources of the DRC, Hollaway reported </p><p>that the soldiers felt that Zimbabwe was actually being </p><p>looted instead.  Timber concessions granted to Zimbabwe have </p><p>turned out to generate insignificant profits, while diamond </p><p>mine concessions have benefited only a handful of the top </p><p>military brass.  While some soldiers are obtaining Zimbabwean </p><p>farms through the land resettlement program, apparently only </p><p>the higher-level officers are beneficiaries.  In return, </p><p>Zimbabwean soldiers have been involved in a long-running </p><p>conflict in a far-off land while the news from home signals </p><p>repressive social legislation, political unrest and domestic </p><p>economic disaster.  Hollaway acknowledged that the return of </p><p>discontented troops to a volatile domestic situation could be </p><p>problematic.  In fact, he speculated that if soldier </p><p>discontent were to ripen into some sort of action, that </p><p>action will likely take the form of a junior-officer coup, </p><p>perhaps with a "sprinkling of generals" just for legitimacy\'s </p><p>sake. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  John Hollaway is a fairly significant mining </p><p>consultant on the regional scene who was introduced to us by </p><p>a well-respected economist.  Hollaway is a second generation </p><p>white Zimbabwean who has experience in assessing deposits and </p><p>mining gold in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Tanzania, among </p><p>other projects, and he is currently working as a consultant </p><p>with Bredenkamp and other local clients in an attempt to </p><p>increase the production of platinum from Zimbabwe.  He has no </p><p>apparent axe to grind and, unlike some other white </p><p>Zimbabweans, he does not seem to be indulging in fanciful </p><p>scenarios wherein U.S. Marines ride in to the rescue.  He did </p><p>not offer his observations as a method of spurring the </p><p>Western powers to action, but simply as responses to </p><p>questions about his recent work in the DRC.  In fact, he was </p><p>on his way to address the Chamber of Commerce in Harare about </p><p>the "window of opportunity" which existed in the DRC mining </p><p>industry, at the request of a DRC contact interested in </p><p>luring Zimbabwean technological investment in the DRC.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
