<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 003269 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USAID ANE/LFORMAN AND AFERRARA </p><p>EMBASSY PHNOM PENH FOR USAID DIRECTOR LISA CHILES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, ELAB, ECON, EAID, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR, ETMIN </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM:  "RIGHTS OF PERSONS" EMPHASIZED AT THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP OF DONORS MEETING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: AT THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP OF DONORS MEETING IN </p><p>HANOI ON DECEMBER 7-8, THERE WAS A WELCOME MESSAGE FROM </p><p>DONORS ON THE ISSUE OF "RIGHTS" WRIT LARGE.  THE CONSISTENCY </p><p>AND THE CLARITY OF THE STATEMENTS BY BOTH INDIVIDUAL </p><p>DELEGATIONS AND NGOS ARE WORTH NOTING.  WHILE IT IS CLEAR </p><p>THAT FOR THE TIME BEING, DONORS ARE NOT PREPARED TO STRICTLY </p><p>CONDITION THEIR ASSISTANCE SOLELY UPON IMPROVEMENT OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS, THE ISSUE IS FIRMLY ON THE TABLE IN MANY DONORS\' </p><p>MINDS AS A MEASURE OF VIETNAM\'S REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>EFFORTS.  ALTHOUGH THE VIETNAMESE DID NOT RESPOND DIRECTLY </p><p>TO THE COMMENTS, THEY CLEARLY WERE TAKING IT ALL IN.  THE </p><p>QUESTION REMAINS, HOWEVER, WHETHER ANY OF THIS WILL HAVE AN </p><p>EFFECT IN THE NEAR TO MEDIUM TERM. THE RESULTS OF THE </p><p>CONSULTATIVE GROUP MEETINGS ARE REPORTED SEPTEL.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   ALL IN AGREEMENT:  DONORS AGREED THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>CORRUPTION, BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW, AN INDEPENDENT AND </p><p>PREDICTABLE JUDICIARY, TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, THE </p><p>PROMOTION OF CIVIL SOCIETY, A FREE MASS MEDIA, PARTICIPATION </p><p>BY THE PEOPLE IN DECISION MAKING, AND HUMAN RIGHTS WERE ALL </p><p>"PILLARS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE."  SEVERAL DONORS MADE THE </p><p>EXPLICIT LINKAGE BETWEEN THE PROTECTION OF LEGAL RIGHTS AND </p><p>THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN A "DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY."  A </p><p>NUMBER OF DONORS WELCOMED THE IMPROVEMENT IN "PERSONAL </p><p>FREEDOMS" AND THE MORE OPEN DIALOGUE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, AND </p><p>EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THIS WOULD CONTINUE AND GROW.  SEVERAL </p><p>DONORS OPINED THAT ALL CITIZENS MUST BE ABLE TO FULLY </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN ECONOMIC AND CIVIC LIFE IF VIETNAM IS TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03269  01 OF 02  170937Z </p><p>ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE SUCCESS ITS ON-GOING POVERTY ALLEVIATION </p><p>AND ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM.   THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE </p><p>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK TOUCHED ON THE ISSUES THROUGH THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF "TRANSPARENCY" AND "GOOD GOVERNANCE", STRESSING </p><p>THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE UNDERPINS THE ENTIRE REFORM EFFORT AND </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO FOCUS MORE ON TRANSPARENCY AND </p><p>GOVERNANCE ISSUES IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT ALL SECTORS OF </p><p>SOCIETY BENEFIT FROM ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION </p><p>EFFORTS.  THE ENTIRE DISCUSSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS RELATED </p><p>TO GOVERNANCE AND CHANGE WAS EXPLICITLY ADDRESSED IN THE </p><p>WORLD BANK\'S CLOSING STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  EUROPEAN UNION:  THE EU WELCOMED THE GENERAL IMPROVEMENT </p><p>IN PERSONAL FREEDOM FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IN VIETNAM AND THE </p><p>MORE OPEN DIALOGUE ON HUMAN RIGHTS BETWEEN THE EU AND </p><p>VIETNAM.   THEY ALSO COMMENTED ON THE NEED FOR INCREASED </p><p>EFFORTS TO ENSURE GREATER LEGITIMACY FOR THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO ENHANCING POPULAR PARTICIPATION. </p><p>THEY NOTED THAT INCREASING ATTENTION IS BEING PAID IN THE EU </p><p>TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS.  THEY ALSO RAISED THEIR CONTINUED </p><p>CONCERN REGARDING LACK OF FREEDOM OF OPINION AND OF </p><p>RELIGION, AS WELL AS THE SITUATION OF ETHNIC MINORITIES, </p><p>RESTRICTIONS IN FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND THE APPLICATION OF </p><p>THE DEATH PENALTY.  THE EU OFFERED TO CONTINUE ITS DIALOGUE </p><p>ON THESE ISSUES AND TO ENHANCE ITS COOPERATION WITH VIETNAM </p><p>IN THESE FIELDS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  FINLAND:  FINLAND ARGUED FOR THAT ONE OF THE KEY </p><p>PREREQUISITES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IS A PARTICIPATORY </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  IT NOTED THE GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY DECREE BUT </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE SPIRIT OF DECREE MUST BE IMPLEMENTED SO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03269  01 OF 02  170937Z </p><p>THAT ALL CITIZENS, INCLUDING WOMEN, ETHNIC MINORITIES AND </p><p>THE DISABLED, WITH THEIR DIFFERENT VIEWS, HAVE A REAL SAY IN </p><p>HOW THEIR SOCIETY IS ADMINISTERED. </p><p> </p><p>5. SWEDEN: SWEDEN FOCUSED ON THE PROMOTION OF CIVIL SOCIETY, </p><p>FREE AND INDEPENDENT MASS MEDIA, PARTICIPATION IN DECISION </p><p>MAKING, POLITICAL PLURALISM AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AS </p><p>THE CORNERSTONES OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. THEY LINKED THOSE </p><p>ISSUES TO CREATING A CLIMATE OF CONFIDENCE FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>ACTORS, TRADERS AND INVESTORS.  SWEDEN OFFERED ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>VIETNAM TO CONDUCT A STUDY ON THE SUCCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF THE GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY DECREE AT THE COMMUNE LEVEL AS </p><p>WELL AS FOR A STUDY ON ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS.  IT </p><p>APPLAUDED THE GVN\'S EFFORTS AT CREATING A MASTER PLAN FOR </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM, BUT URGED THE GVN TO USE THE SAME </p><p>ENERGY IN DRAFTING A MASTER PLAN ON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE </p><p>REFORM.  SWEDEN PUSHED FOR GREATER LEGAL REFORM, STRESSING </p><p>THAT LEGAL REFORM WILL HAVE TO DIRECTLY EMPHASIZE THE </p><p>STATE\'S OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, PARALLEL WITH </p><p>THE PROTECTION OF DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  NGOS: THE NGOS NOTED THE NEED TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>LABOR RIGHTS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT.  THEY HIGHLIGHTED THE </p><p>NEED TO INCREASE LOCAL ASSOCIATION RIGHTS, FOSTER A MORE </p><p>PARTICIPATORY GOVERNMENT, AND IMPLEMENT GRASS ROOTS </p><p>DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  OTHERS:  DENMARK RAISED THE NEED FOR IMPROVED HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND NOTED THAT ALL STAKE HOLDERS NEED TO BE INVOLVED </p><p>IN DISCUSSION OF FUTURE REFORMS, SUCH AS INCREASING </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY.  NEW ZEALAND LINKED THE NEED </p><p>FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE TO ACHIEVE REFORM GOALS, INCLUDING LEGAL </p><p>REFORMS, AND STRESSED THAT HUMAN RIGHTS DEPEND ON GOOD </p><p>GOVERNANCE.  NORWAY APPLAUDED THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT STILL HAS CONCERNS OVER THE STATE OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS IN VIETNAM.  IT ALSO ECHOED THE EU STATEMENT ON </p><p>PROGRESS.  SWITZERLAND STRESSED THE NEED FOR THE PROMOTION </p><p>OF A CIVIL SOCIETY, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GRASSROOTS </p><p>DEMOCRACY ACT, AND ACTIONS TO RECTIFY GENDER INEQUALITY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE VIETNAMESE RESPONSE:  THE GVN REPRESENTATIVES AT THE </p><p>CG DID NOT RESPOND TO DONOR INTERVENTIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>BUT NEITHER DID THEY DID PROTEST THEM, ASSERT THAT THEY DID </p><p>NOT BELONG IN A DISCUSSION OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, OR </p><p>REQUEST THAT MENTION OF IT BE DELETED FROM THE DRAFT OF THE </p><p>PROCEEDINGS.  IN HIS RESPONSE TO THE SESSION ON PUBLIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATION REFORM AND GOOD GOVERNANCE IN WHICH MOST OF </p><p>THE POINTS ABOVE WERE RAISED, MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND </p><p>INVESTMENT TRAN XUAN GIA, THE SENIOR GVN OFFICIAL PRESENT </p><p>FOR THE WORKING SESSIONS, AGREED THAT IMPROVING GOVERNANCE </p><p>AND TRANSPARENCY WERE IMPORTANT ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>9. COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH THE VIETNAMESE DID NOT RESPOND </p><p>DIRECTLY TO THE COMMENTS BY DONORS, THEY CLEARLY WERE TAKING </p><p>IT ALL IN.  THE QUESTION REMAINS, HOWEVER, WHETHER ANY OF </p><p>THIS WILL HAVE AN EFFECT IN THE NEAR TO MEDIUM TERM.
