<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 000025 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR BBG GOVERNOR NORM PATTIZ FROM AMBASSADOR MARCELLE </p><p>WAHBA; BBG INFO GTHATCHER, SGANDJI </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/PPD DMACINNES, ACASPER, JDAVIES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BBG, PREL, KPAO, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE MINISTER OF INFORMATION GIVES GREEN LIGHT </p><p>FOR MIDDLE EAST TELEVISION NETWORK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  I CALLED ON UAE MININFO AND PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>SON SHAYKH ABDULLAH BIN ZAYED ON DECEMBER 30 TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE PROPOSED MIDDLE EAST TELEVISION NETWORK (METN).  THE </p><p>MINISTER WELCOMED BOTH THE IDEA OF THE NEW STATION AND </p><p>THE PROSPECT OF LOCATING IT IN THE UAE, ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>ABU DHABI.  SHOULD THE UAE BE THE SITE CHOSEN BY THE </p><p>BBG, MY MISSION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY </p><p>WITH YOUR TEAM TO BRING THIS PROJECT TO FRUITION.  WE </p><p>AWAIT A DETAILED PROPOSAL IN ORDER TO ASSIST YOU AS </p><p>FULLY AS POSSIBLE.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  FURTHER TO EXPLORATORY SITE VISITS TO THE UAE BY IBB </p><p>STAFF, I CALLED ON UAE MININFO SHAYKH ABDULLAH DECEMBER </p><p>30 TO EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF THE METN AND GAUGE HIS </p><p>REACTION TO THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCATING IT IN ABU DHABI </p><p>OR DUBAI. THE MINISTER INDICATED THAT HE HAD BEEN WELL- </p><p>BRIEFED ON THE EARLIER VISITS BY AHMAD BLOUSHI, HEAD OF </p><p>EMIRATES MEDIA INC. (EMI). HE ASKED WHAT SORT OF </p><p>PROGRAMMING THE NETWORK WOULD BROADCAST.  I EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT THE PLAN FOR THE METN WAS STILL IN ITS FORMATIVE </p><p>STAGES BUT THAT IT ENVISIONS A MIXTURE OF SIXTY PERCENT </p><p>NEWS, FORTY PERCENT FEATURES IN AN ALL-ARABIC SEVEN-DAY, </p><p>24-HOUR FORMAT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>"WE ARE PROUD TO BE A PART OF IT:" MINISTER WELCOMES TV </p><p>PROPOSAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE MINISTER WELCOMED THE IDEA ENTHUSIASTICALLY, </p><p>NOTING THAT THE NEWS OPERATION OF EMIRATES MEDIA WOULD </p><p>SOON BE VACATING ITS OLD STUDIOS IN ABU DHABI, LEAVING </p><p>THEM AVAILABLE FOR A NEW TENANT. HE ADDED THAT IN FOUR </p><p>YEARS, THE EMI TELEVISION OPERATION WOULD MOVE TO NEW </p><p>PREMISES IN ABU DHABI, LEAVING ITS ENTIRE SITE, WITH SIX </p><p>TELEVISION STUDIOS, FREE.  HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT EMI </p><p>HAS PREMISES IN DUBAI MEDIA CITY WHICH BBG COULD USE IN </p><p>THE FUTURE IF THEY WANT TO BUILD A FACILITY THERE.  WHEN </p><p>I ASKED HIM IF THE UAEG WOULD BE "COMFORTABLE" WITH THE </p><p>IDEA OF HOSTING SUCH A STATION AND WITH ITS POLITICAL </p><p>OVERTONES, HE REPLIED UNHESITATINGLY: "YES, OF COURSE. </p><p>WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR THE FINANCIAL ELEMENT.  I AM </p><p>LOOKING FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN TWO ENTITIES.  WE WILL </p><p>BOTH BENEFIT."  HE ADDED: "WE FEEL PROUD TO BE PART OF </p><p>THIS.  THIS IS NOT A THING WE WANT TO DO BEHIND THE </p><p>SCENES; WE WANT IT TO BE PUBLIC." </p><p> </p><p>4. FOR MY PART, I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE THE UAEG\'S </p><p>POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSED TV NETWORK.  SHOULD </p><p>THE UAE BE THE SITE CHOSEN BY THE BBG, MY MISSION AND I </p><p>LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOUR TEAM TO BRING </p><p>THIS PROJECT TO FRUITION.  WE AWAIT A DETAILED PROPOSAL </p><p>IN ORDER TO ASSIST YOU AS FULLY AS POSSIBLE.  WITH BEST </p><p>REGARDS.  MARCELLE WAHBA </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
