JAMMEH WAS </p><p>REELECTED WITH 52.96 PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN THE </p><p>OCTOBER 18, 2001 POLL.  THE INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL </p><p>COMMISSION (IEC) ANNOUNCED THE OFFICIAL RESULTS AT </p><p>1830 LOCAL TIME ON OCTOBER 19, 2001.  MAJOR </p><p>CHALLENGER OUSAINOU DARBOE (WHO POLLED 32.67 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE VOTE) CALLED PRESIDENT JAMMEH DURING THE </p><p>AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 19 TO CONCEDE DEFEAT. </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS STATED THAT THEY </p><p>WERE `SATISFIED\' WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE VOTE.

WE DEPLOYED A TEAM OF SIX IEC-ACCREDITED </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS FOR THE OCTOBER 18 POLL.  WE </p><p>CONTRIBUTED OUR CDA, IROG, GSO, OUR PROGRAM </p><p>COORDINATOR AND OUR POLITICAL ASSISTANT. IN THEIR </p><p>CONTINUING TRADITION OF UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>US, EMBASSY DAKAR CONTRIBUTED THE DATT.  CDA AND OUR </p><p>POLITICAL ASSISTANT COVERED THE WEST COAST AND THE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE STADIUM COUNTING CENTER IN BAKAU </p><p>(BANJUL) ON OCTOBER 18.  IROG COVERED THE FIVE FONI </p><p>DIVISIONS AND THE BWIAM COUNTING CENTER FROM OCTOBER </p><p>16-19.  GSO COVERED THE THREE KIANG DIVISIONS AND </p><p>THE KWINELLA COUNTING CENTER FROM OCTOBER 16-19. </p><p>THE DATT COVERED ILLIASA DIVISION AND THE FARAFENNI </p><p>COUNTING CENTER FROM OCTOBER 17-19.  OUR PROGRAM </p><p>COORDINATOR COVERED BIJILO (THE SUBURBAN BANJUL </p><p>POLLING STATION THAT HAD THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF </p><p>VOTERS REGISTERED IN A SINGLE POLLING STATION IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY), AND CROSSED THE RIVER TO COVER ALBREDA, </p><p>JUFFUREH AND BINTA KINTEH ON OCTOBER 18.  EACH TEAM </p><p>PICKED ONE POLLING STATION TO OBSERVE OPEN AND </p><p>CLOSE, AND THEN TO FOLLOW TO THE RESPECTIVE COUNTING </p><p>CENTER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  OVER 80 PERCENT OF THE 509,395 REGISTERED VOTERS </p><p>VOTED DURING THE OCTOBER 18 POLL.  THESE VOTERS </p><p>UTILIZED 811 POLLING STATIONS.  VOTING TOOK PLACE </p><p>FROM 0700-1600. THE VOTES CAST IN THESE 811 POLLING </p><p>STATIONS WERE COUNTED IN GROUPS CORRESPONDING TO THE </p><p>48 CONSTITUENCIES IN THE COUNTRY, AT 28 COUNTING </p><p>CENTERS.  THE RESULTS FROM THESE COUNTING CENTERS </p><p>WERE TRANSMITTED TO 7 COLLATION CENTERS </p><p>CORRESPONDING TO THE 7 ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  EACH COLLATION CENTER REPORTED THEIR </p><p>RESULTS TO IEC HEADQUARTERS IN BANJUL, WHERE THEY </p><p>WERE ANNOUNCED AS RECEIVED BY IEC DIRECTOR GABRIEL </p><p>ROBERTS.  PRESIDENT JAMMEH AND THE APRC RECEIVED </p><p>242,302 VOTES (52,96 PERCENT), OUSANINOU DARBOE AND </p><p>THE UDP COALITION RECEIVED 149,448 VOTES (32.67 </p><p>PERCENT), HAMAT BAH AND THE NRP RECEIVED 35,671 </p><p>VOTES (7.8 PERCENT), SHERIFF DIBBA AND THE NCP </p><p>RECEIVED 17,271 VOTES (3.78 PERCENT) AND SIDIA </p><p>JATTA AND THE PDOIS RECEIVED 13,841 VOTES (3.03 </p><p>PERCENT). </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE FOLLOWING PERSONS WERE AUTHORIZED TO BE </p><p>PRESENT IN A POLLING STATION DURING THE POLL: </p><p>POLLING STATION STAFF (CONSISTING OF A PRESIDING </p><p>OFFICER (PO), AN ASSISTANT PRESIDING OFFICER (APO) </p><p>AND TWO POLICE OFFICERS ASSIGNED AS SECURITY), </p><p>POLLING AGENTS FROM ALL FIVE POLITICAL PARTIES, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND CREDENTIALED PRESS. </p><p>UPON ARRIVAL BEFORE THE 0700 STARTING TIME, ANY OF </p><p>THE ABOVEMENTIONED PRESENT WERE TO INSPECT THE </p><p>VOTING DRUMS.  EACH DRUM WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN TO </p><p>SHOW THAT IT WAS EMPTY.  THE ASSISTANT PRESIDING </p><p>OFFICER THEN PLACED SAND IN THE VOTING DRUM, FOR </p><p>STABILITY.  WHILE OTHER POLLING STATION STAFF AND </p><p>OTHER AUTHORIZED PERSONS WATCHED, THE PRESIDING </p><p>OFFICER SEALED EACH VOTING CAN WITH NUMBERED RED </p><p>PLASTIC SEALS AND LINKED ALL OF THE CANS TOGETHER </p><p>WITH A METAL WIRE.  THE CANS WERE LINKED TOGETHER IN </p><p>ALPHABETICAL ORDER BY NAME OF THE CANDIDATE (BAH OF </p><p>THE NRP, DARBOE OF THE UDP COALITION, DIBBA OF THE </p><p>NCP, JAMMEH OF THE APRC AND JATTA OF THE PDOIS). </p><p>VOTING OFFICIALS RECORDED THE NUMBERS ON THE SEALS </p><p>BEFORE THE VOTING CANS WERE TAKEN INSIDE THE VOTING </p><p>ROOM. </p><p> </p><p>AS PER IEC REGULATIONS, THE VOTING CANS WERE COLOR- </p><p>CODED ACCORDING TO POLITICAL PARTY (UDP YELLOW, APRC </p><p>GREEN, NRP BLUE, PDOIS BROWN AND NCP WHITE). </p><p>PICTURES OF THE POLITICAL CANDIDATES WERE AFFIXED TO </p><p>THE VOTING CANS ALONG WITH THEIR NAMES AND </p><p>CORRESPONDING POLITICAL PARTY SYMBOLS. </p><p> </p><p>THE ACTUAL VOTING AREA WAS A ROOM OR AN ENCLOSED </p><p>AREA OUTSIDE THAT HAD BEEN SET ASIDE FOR VOTING </p><p>PURPOSES.  THE VOTING CANS WERE PLACED ON A TABLE IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA.  IN ORDER TO </p><p>MAINTAIN PRIVACY DURING VOTING THERE WERE SHEETS </p><p>PLACED ON THE WINDOWS AND THE ENTRANCE OF ROOMS, OR </p><p>POLLING STATION STAFF GUARDED THE ENTRANCE TO THE </p><p>ENCLOSED AREA. </p><p> </p><p>ONCE A VOTER ARRIVED, S/HE PRESENTED HIS/HER VOTER </p><p>REGISTRATION CARD TO THE APO.  THE APO CALLED OUT </p><p>THE VOTER\'S NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER.  THE </p><p>POLLING AGENTS CONFIRMED THAT THE PERSON WAS ON THE </p><p>POLLING STATION REGISTRATION LIST PROVIDED BY THE </p><p>IEC.  THE VOTER\'S INDEX FINGER WAS DIPPED INTO </p><p>PURPLE INK.  THE APO GAVE THE PO THE VOTER\'S VOTER </p><p>REGISTRATION CARD.  THE PO VERIFIED THAT THE PICTURE </p><p>ON THE CARD CORRESPONDED TO THE PERSON PRESENT. </p><p>AFTER RE-CONFIRMING THE VOTER\'S IDENTITY, THE PO </p><p>GAVE THE VOTER A YELLOW MARBLE AND ALLOWED HIM/HER </p><p>TO ENTER THE VOTING ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA.  THE APO, PO </p><p>AND POLLING AGENTS WERE GENERALLY SEATED NEXT TO THE </p><p>ENTRANCE OF THE VOTING ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA.  VOTERS </p><p>PLACED THEIR MARBLE IN A TUBE ON THE CAN </p><p>CORRESPONDING TO THEIR CANDIDATE.  AS THE MARBLE </p><p>WENT DOWN THE TUBE INTO THE CAN, IT RANG A BELL, </p><p>SIGNIFYING THAT A VOTE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY CAST. </p><p>THE PO LISTENED FOR THE BELL TO RING WHILE THE OTHER </p><p>VOTING OFFICIALS CONTINUED TO PROCESS PEOPLE IN THE </p><p>LINE.  AFTER THE BELL RANG IN THE VOTING </p><p>ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA, THE VOTER EXITED, AND THE PO </p><p>RETURNED HIS/HER VOTER REGISTRATION CARD.  THE PO </p><p>THEN INSTRUCTED THE VOTER TO LEAVE THE ROOM/AREA. </p><p> </p><p>4. IROG NOTED THAT IEC OFFICIALS AND PARTY AGENTS IN </p><p>THE FONI REGION SEEMED TO BE DOING THEIR BEST TO </p><p>KEEP VOTING ORDERLY DESPITE THEIR EGREGIOUS LACK OF </p><p>PREPARATION, ORGANIZATION, TRAINING, COMMUNICATION, </p><p>AND MATERIALS.  WIDESPREAD INCONSISTENCIES </p><p>UNDERMINED THE SECURITY AND UNIFORMITY OF THE </p><p>PROCESS.  THE AREA RETURNING OFFICERS (ARO), WHO </p><p>WERE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE MATERIALS AND DEFINITIVE </p><p>ANSWERS, SEEMED TO BE SPREAD TOO THIN OVER LARGE </p><p>AREAS, AS THEY WERE NEVER AROUND WHEN THE POS NEEDED </p><p>THEIR SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>AMONG 15 POLLING STATIONS, IROG NOTED AT LEAST THREE </p><p>DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CONTROVERSIAL RULE </p><p>ON THE PROCEDURE FOR VOTERS WHO HAD CARDS BUT WERE </p><p>NOT ON THE REGISTRATION LIST.  AT LEAST 5 POLLING </p><p>STATIONS WERE NOT ABLE COMPLETELY SEAL THE BALLOT </p><p>DRUMS.  AT THE SIBANOR COUNTING CENTER AT BWIAM, ONE </p><p>CONSTITUENCY FOLLOWED IEC RULES TO THE LETTER, WHILE </p><p>THE AROS FOR THE OTHER CONSTITUENCY DID NOT SEEM TO </p><p>KNOW ANY OF THE RULES FOR COUNTING. </p><p> </p><p>VOTERS WERE PATIENT AND CALM IN LINE AND IN  POLLING </p><p>STATIONS DESPITE EXTREME HEAT, WAITING PERIODS OF UP </p><p>TO FOUR HOURS, AND CONFUSION ABOUT RULES AND </p><p>PROCEDURES.  DESPITE THE OBVIOUS HOLES IN THE VOTING </p><p>PROCESS, IROG SAW NO EVIDENCE THAT THOSE HOLES WERE </p><p>MALICIOUSLY EXPLOITED TO MANIPULATE THE RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE ATMOSPHERE IN FONI WAS SO STUBBORNLY PRO-JAMMEH </p><p>THAT IT SEEMS DOUBTFUL THAT AN OPPOSITION SUPPORTER </p><p>WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE VOICING HIS OPINION. </p><p>MOREOVER, KNOWING HOW MANY OF HIS FELLOW VILLAGERS </p><p>WOULD VOTE FOR JAMMEH, ANYONE VOTING FOR ANOTHER </p><p>CANDIDATE WOULD KNOW HIS SINGLE VOTE IN THE BALLOT </p><p>DRUM WOULD STAND OUT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  CDA AND OUR POLITICAL ASSISTANT COVERED THE WEST </p><p>COAST (THE NICKNAME FOR THE GAMBIA\'S WESTERN </p><p>DIVISION, AS WELL AS THE NAME OF THE GAMBIA\'S MOST </p><p>POPULAR RADIO STATION, BROADCAST ON 95.3 FM), WHICH </p><p>INCLUDED POLLING STATIONS IN KANIFING, KOTU, KOLOLI, </p><p>LAMIN, BAKAU, CAPE POINT, BRUFUT, FAJARA, GUNJUR AND </p><p>KARTUNG ON OCTOBER 18.  WE CHOSE THIS AREA BECAUSE </p><p>THERE WERE FEARS THAT FOREIGNERS OF PRESIDENT </p><p>JAMMEH\'S DJOLA ETHNIC GROUP WOULD ATTEMPT TO USE </p><p>FALSE VOTER REGISTRATION CARDS TO VOTE FOR HIM IN </p><p>THESE POROUS BORDER AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>GAMBIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY AND POLICE OFFICIALS HAD </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT SOLDIERS WOULD BE CONFINED TO THEIR </p><p>BARRACKS ON OCTOBER 18 (SINCE SECURITY WOULD BE </p><p>PROVIDED BY THE POLICE), SO WE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE </p><p>UNIFORMED SOLDIERS AT THE FAJARA, BAKAU AND CAPE </p><p>POINT POLLING STATIONS.  INQUIRIES TO THE RESPECTIVE </p><p>COMMANDERS ELICITED THE INFORMATION THAT ANY SOLDIER </p><p>PRESENT AT A POLLING STATION WAS REGISTERED THERE </p><p>AND SOLELY AT THAT STATIONS TO VOTE.  WE VERIFIED </p><p>THAT ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT WE SAW AT THE THREE </p><p>POLLING STATIONS WERE ALL REGISTERED VOTERS THAT ALL </p><p>VOTED AND LEFT PROMPTLY AFTER DOING SO. </p><p> </p><p>THE IEC DID NOT REVERSE THEIR DECISION TO RESTRICT </p><p>VOTING TO VOTERS LISTED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE POLLING </p><p>STATION WHO HAD CORRESPONDING VOTER REGISTRATION </p><p>CARDS, ALTHOUGH THEY DID ALLOW IEC WORKERS WITH </p><p>VOTER REGISTRATION CARDS TO VOTE WHEREVER THEY WERE </p><p>ASSIGNED.  AS A RESULT, WE DID NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE </p><p>OR RECEIVE ANY REPORTS OF FOREIGNERS USING FALSE </p><p>REGISTRATION CARDS TO VOTE.  CDA NOTED SEVERAL WOMEN </p><p>IN LINE NURSING THEIR CHILDREN WHILE WAITING, AS </p><p>WELL AS SEVERAL VOTERS WHO STOOD ON LINE WITH THEIR </p><p>LIVESTOCK... </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS THE GAMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAD ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>THEIR LAND BORDERS WOULD BE CLOSED FROM OCTOBER 17- </p><p>19, WE ASKED OUR DATT TO COVER ILLIASA DIVISION.  AN </p><p>OPPOSITION STRONGHOLD AS WELL AS CONTAINING THE MAIN </p><p>UPCOUNTRY ROAD/FERRY CROSSING AT FARAFENNI, ILLIASA </p><p>ALSO HOSTS THE MAJOR UPCOUNTRY MILITARY BARRACKS AND </p><p>CUSTOMS POST.  IN LINE WITH OUR OTHER OBSERVERS, THE </p><p>DATT NOTED THAT THE VOTING PROCESS WENT MORE OR LESS </p><p>SMOOTHLY, WITH HIGH VOTER TURNOUT AND VOTERS </p><p>PATIENTLY WAITING IN LONG LINES WHICH WERE IN </p><p>EVIDENCE BY 0615 IN THE MORNING.  THE BORDER </p><p>REMAINED HERMETICALLY SEALED THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>ANNOUNCED PERIOD, FREEING THE NUMEROUS CUSTOMS </p><p>OFFICIALS IN THE REGION TO PERFORM THEIR CIVIC DUTY </p><p>WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING CALLED IN TO WORK.  THE DATT </p><p>DID NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE OR RECEIVE ANY REPORTS OF </p><p>FOREIGNERS USING FALSE REGISTRATION CARDS TO VOTE IN </p><p>THIS HEAVILY-TRANSITED AREA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WE SENT OUR GSO TO THE OTHER OPPOSITION </p><p>STRONGHOLD OF KWINELLA, THE NEXUS OF KIANG CENTRAL </p><p>DIVISION.  THERE WERE VASTLY MORE WOMEN VOTING IN </p><p>THIS DIVISION THAN MEN.  THIS DISCREPANCY WAS </p><p>EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT MOST MEN IN THE DIVISION </p><p>WORKED IN THE GREATER BANJUL AREA, AND HAD CHANGED </p><p>THEIR REGISTRATION ACCORDINGLY.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>STRICTLY ADHERING TO VOTING PROCEDURES, OUR GSO </p><p>NOTED THAT EACH POLLING STATION HAD DESIGNATED ONE </p><p>OF THEIR POLICE OFFICERS TO ASSIST VOTERS WHO WERE </p><p>ELDERLY/DISABLED OR OTHERWISE NEEDED ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO/FROM (BUT NOT INTO) THE VOTING ROOM/AREA.  HE SAW </p><p>NO OTHER OBSERVERS OR MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES IN THE </p><p>POLLING STATIONS HE VISITED.  GSO ALSO NOTED THAT </p><p>ALL VOTERS IN THIS AREA WERE DRESSED IN THEIR </p><p>FINEST, COMMENSURATE WITH THE IMPORTANCE THEY </p><p>ATTACHED TO THE OCCASION... </p><p> </p><p>8. THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED VOTERS AT BIJILO </p><p>EXCEEDED 1,000.  TO ACCOMMODATE THIS LARGE NUMBER OF </p><p>VOTERS, THE IEC DECIDED TO CREATE TWO POLLING </p><p>STATIONS AT BIJILO PRIMARY SCHOOL.  THE POLLING </p><p>STATIONS WERE LOCATED IN THE SAME SCHOOL BLOCK BUT </p><p>SEPARATED BY A FEW CLASSROOMS.  OUR PROGRAM </p><p>COORDINATOR (PC) OBSERVED THAT VOTERS APPEARED </p><p>CONFUSED BY THIS ARRANGEMENT.  THE FIRST VOTES AT </p><p>EACH POLLING STATION WERE CAST AFTER 0700, BUT </p><p>BEFORE 0800.  SHE NOTED THAT VOTING WENT ON AT A </p><p>BRISK PACE UNTIL SHE LEFT AT 1015 TO TRAVEL TO </p><p>ALBREDA BY BOAT.  SHE RETURNED TO BIJILO AT 1530 TO </p><p>OBSERVE THAT BOTH POLLING STATIONS CLOSED ON TIME. </p><p> </p><p>ARRIVING AT THE ALBREDA DOCK AT 1200, OUR PC WAS </p><p>STRUCK BY THE SEA OF GREEN WHICH GREETED HER.  THERE </p><p>WERE LARGE GREEN FLAGS FLYING IN FRONT OF HOUSES AND </p><p>SHOPS ALL THE WAY UP THE HILL TO THE POLLING </p><p>STATION.  THE PERSON WHO GUIDED HER FROM THE DOCK TO </p><p>THE POLLING STATION VOLUNTEERED THAT ALBREDA AND </p><p>JUFFUREH WERE APRC STRONGHOLDS. </p><p> </p><p>THE POLLING STATION (NORMALLY USED AS A COMMUNITY </p><p>HEALTH CENTER) WAS CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS A VOTING </p><p>LOCATION.  ONCE INSIDE THE COMPOUND, THE POLICE </p><p>ASSIGNED TO THIS POLLING STATION DIRECTED OUR PC  TO </p><p>THE VOTING AREA.  ALBREDA IS ONE OF THE FEW POLLING </p><p>STATIONS WHERE A TEAM MEMBER MET REPRESENTATIVES OF </p><p>ALL FIVE POLITICAL PARTIES.  THE POLLING STAFF </p><p>APPEARED WELL ORGANIZED AND CARRIED OUT THEIR DUTIES </p><p>IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. IN RESPONSE TO HER </p><p>INQUIRY, POLLING STAFF STATED THAT VOTING HAD TAKEN </p><p>PLACE WITHOUT INCIDENT. VOTING BEGAN PROMPTLY AT </p><p>0700, AND ALTHOUGH THERE WERE LONG LINES, EVERYONE </p><p>COOPERATED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS.  STAFF HAD </p><p>NOT COME ACROSS ANY VOTERS WHO WERE NOT PROPERLY </p><p>REGISTERED TO VOTE. OUR PC WAS HEARTENED BY WHAT SHE </p><p>SAW AT THIS POLLING STATION. </p><p> </p><p>BEFORE DEPARTING FROM THE ALBREDA DOCK, OUR PC </p><p>WALKED TO JUFFUREH (ABOUT 10 MINUTES AWAY) TO ELICIT </p><p>BINTA KINTEH\'S THOUGHTS ON THE POLL.  MS. KINTEH </p><p>CLAIMS TO BE THE OLDEST LIVING PERSON IN THE </p><p>ALBREDA/JUFFUREH AREA, AS WELL AS A RELATIVE OF </p><p>KUNTA KINTEH (OF `ROOTS\' FAME) AND FORMER U.S. </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE GAMBIA GEORGE HALEY.   MS. KINTEH </p><p>STATED THAT SHE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE </p><p>TO VOTE AND NOTED THAT SHE AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS HAD </p><p>VOTED EARLIER IN THE DAY (THEY DIDN\'T SAY WHO THEY </p><p>HAD VOTED FOR).  THEY PROUDLY DISPLAYED THEIR PURPLE </p><p>FINGERS TO OUR PC TO PROVE IT.  MS. KINTEH </p><p>ADDITIONALLY STATED THAT SHE FELT THAT VOTING IN HER </p><p>AREA HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A FAIR AND PEACEFUL MANNER. </p><p>OUR PC AND MS. KINTEH ENDED THEIR CONVERSATION BY </p><p>WISHING EACH OTHER WELL. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE SURPRISING EASE OF THE POLL DID NOT EXTEND TO </p><p>THE COUNT.  POLLING STATIONS OBSERVED STOPPED </p><p>ACCEPTING NEW VOTERS MORE OR LESS AT OR AROUND 1600. </p><p>HOWEVER, THEY THEN ALLOWED ANY VOTER PRESENT TO </p><p>COMPLETE THE VOTING PROCESS, WHICH, IN SOME CASES, </p><p>TOOK UP TO THREE MORE HOURS.  THE PO, APO AND </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY AGENTS THEN CARRIED THE VOTING CANS </p><p>OUTSIDE THE VOTING ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA.  IN THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF THE POLICE, POLLING STAFF AND ANY OTHER </p><p>AUTHORIZED PERSONS PRESENT, THE PO SEALED THE VOTING </p><p>CANS WITH A WHITE CARD AND A NUMBERED RED PLASTIC </p><p>SEALS (FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE ON EACH CAN).  AT THIS </p><p>POINT, THE PO BEGAN TO TALLY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE </p><p>WHO HAD CAST BALLOTS.  THE PO CHECKED THE NUMBER OF </p><p>MARBLES REMAINING AGAINST THE TOTAL NUMBER OF </p><p>MARBLES ISSUED FOR THE POLLING STATION BY THE IEC. </p><p>THE PO ALSO CHECKED THE NUMBER OF MARBLES USED </p><p>AGAINST THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE APO MARKED ON THE </p><p>REGISTRATION LIST AS HAVING VOTED.  THE POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY AGENTS ALSO CHECKED THEIR LISTS TO CONFIRM </p><p>THAT THE NUMBERS WERE THE SAME.  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS VERSUS THE NO-SHOW VOTERS WAS ALSO </p><p>TALLIED.  ONCE THIS PROCESS WAS CONCLUDED, POLLING </p><p>STAFF RECORDED ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION ON IEC </p><p>FORMS.  THEN POLLING STAFF AND POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>AGENTS WAITED FOR THE IEC-ASSIGNED ARO TO COME TO </p><p>THE POLLING STATION WITH THE AUTHORIZED TRANSPORT TO </p><p>THE COUNTING CENTER. </p><p> </p><p>ONCE THE ARO ARRIVED WITH APPROVED TRANSPORT (THE </p><p>EARLIEST THIS TOOK PLACE WAS AT 1745 AT CDA\'S </p><p>POLLING STATION, WHERE VOTING ENDED ON SCHEDULE AT </p><p>1600), THE VOTING CANS WERE PLACED IN IT.  THE CANS </p><p>WERE THEN TRANSPORTED TO THE RELEVANT COUNTING </p><p>CENTER IN THE SAME VEHICLE ACCOMPANIED BY ALL </p><p>POLLING STAFF, POLITICAL PARTY AGENTS THAT WERE </p><p>PRESENT (NORMALLY JUST FROM THE UDP AND APRC) AND </p><p>THE POLICE ASSIGNED TO THE POLLING STATION.  THIS </p><p>PROCESS WAS PATHOLOGICALLY DISORGANIZED THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE COUNTRY, AND WAS THE MAJOR BASIS FOR THE MORE </p><p>THAN 24-HOUR DELAY IN ANNOUNCING THE FINAL ELECTION </p><p>RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>CDA FOLLOWED THE VOTING CANS FROM HER CHOSEN POLLING </p><p>STATION TO THEIR ASSIGNED COUNTING CENTER AT </p><p>INDEPENDENCE STADIUM IN BAKAU (BANJUL).  HER POLLING </p><p>STATION WAS THE FIRST TO TURN OVER ITS CANS AT 1755. </p><p>THE PO (IN THE PRESENCE OF THE OTHER POLLING STAFF </p><p>AND ACCOMPANYING POLITICAL PARTY REPRESENTATIVES) </p><p>HANDED OVER THE VOTING CANS TO THE CONSTITUENCY IEC </p><p>RETURNING OFFICER. </p><p> </p><p>ANOTHER MAJOR RESULTS-DELAYING FACTOR WAS THE FACT </p><p>THAT THE RETURNING OFFICERS REFUSED TO COUNT THE </p><p>RESULTS FROM POLLING STATIONS UNTIL ALL THE CANS </p><p>FROM EACH CONSTITUENCY WERE PRESENT, RATHER THAT </p><p>COUNT THEM AS THEY CAME IN.   COUNTING FOR JESHWANG </p><p>DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL 2130, AFTER THE CANS FROM ALL </p><p>THE 24 POLLING STATIONS IN THE CONSTITUENCY ARRIVED. </p><p>COUNTING STARTED WITH THE CANS FROM CDA\'S CHOSEN </p><p>POLLING STATION, SINCE THOSE CANS HAD BEEN TURNED </p><p>OVER FIRST.  THE COUNTING PROCESS WAS SYSTEMATIC, </p><p>ORDERLY, TRANSPARENT AND ACCURATE, INCLUDED A </p><p>CHALLENGE FROM THE APRC PARTY REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>(LOOKING FOR 6 NON-EXISTENT ADDITIONAL VOTES) AND </p><p>ENDED AT 2200. </p><p> </p><p>ONCE ALL OF THE POLLING STATIONS HAD BEEN COUNTED </p><p>(AT 1030 ON OCTOBER 19 FOR JESHWANG, SIMILARLY FOR </p><p>THE OTHERS OBSERVED BY THE TEAM), THE RESULTS WERE </p><p>ENTERED ON AN IEC FORM AND THEN TAKEN TO THE </p><p>COLLATION CENTER, WHICH WAS IN CDA\'S CASE </p><p>CONVENIENTLY LOCATED IN ANOTHER ROOM AT THE STADIUM. </p><p>FROM THERE, THE RESULTS WERE FAXED TO IEC </p><p>HEADQUARTERS AT 1100 ON OCTOBER 19.  IEC DIRECTOR </p><p>GABRIEL ROBERTS THEN OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED THE </p><p>RESULTS AT 1400 ON OCTOBER 19. </p><p> </p><p>10.  INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS WERE UNIFORM </p><p>IN EXPRESSING THEIR GENERAL SATISFACTION WITH THE </p><p>CONDUCT OF VOTING ON OCTOBER 19.  THERE WERE OVER </p><p>100 INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS PARTICIPATING IN THE </p><p>POLL, INCLUDING OUR SIX.  DR. JACKIE DUGARD OF THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT (WHO FIELDED ABOUT 25 </p><p>OBSERVERS) STATED THAT SHE WAS SURPRISED AAT HOW </p><p>WELL EVERYTHING HAD GONE.  SRSG JAMES GBEHO, </p><p>CURRENTLY AN INDEPENDENT MP IN GHANA, CONGRATULATED </p><p>THE GAMBIAN PEOPLE ON A JOB WELL DONE.  EU RESREP </p><p>GEORGE-MARC ANDRE STATED THAT HIS OVERALL IMPRESSION </p><p>OF THE POLL WAS POSITIVE.  UN RESREP JOHN KAKONGE </p><p>STATED THAT THE FLAWS HE OBSERVED DID NOT PERTAIN TO </p><p>THE ACTUAL POLLING OR COUNTING PROCESS.  PURPORTED </p><p>WORLD CONFERENCE OF MAYORS REPRESENTATIVE USC JOHNNY </p><p>FORD AND HIS TEAM REPORTEDLY `HIGH-FIVED\' ALL THE </p><p>GAMBIANS PRESENT IN THE BAR WHERE THEY HEARD THE </p><p>OFFICIAL RESULTS ANNOUNCED, THEN STATED THAT THEY </p><p>LOOKED FORWARD TO WORKING WITH A GAMBIA FREE OF </p><p>OPPRESSIVE COLONIALST INFLUENCE... </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN A STUNNING SHOW OF ELECTORAL GRACE RARELY </p><p>SEEN IN AFRICA OR ELSEWHERE, MAJOR CHALLENGER AND </p><p>UDP OPPOSITION COALITION LEADER OUSAINOU DARBOE (WHO </p><p>POLLED 32.67 PERCENT OF THE VOTE) CALLED PRESIDENT </p><p>JAMMEH DURING THE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 19 TO CONCEDE </p><p>DEFEAT.  DARBOE THEN CONVENED A PRESS CONFERENCE AT </p><p>HIS HOME TO ANNOUNCE HIS CONCESSION.  HE STATED THAT </p><p>HIS CONCESSION IN NO WAY SUGGESTED THAT THE ELECTION </p><p>WAS FLAWLESS, RATHER IT SUGGESTED THAT AS A DEMOCRAT </p><p>COMMITTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, HE RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT HE HAD LOST THE ELECTION AND WAS READY TO FOCUS </p><p>HIS EFFORTS ON THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS SCHEDULED </p><p>FOR SPRING 2002, IN WHICH HE EXPECTS THAT THE </p><p>COALITION WILL WIN A MAJORITY.  THIS SENTIMENT WAS </p><p>ECHOED TO CDA BY HIS CHIEF LIEUTENANT, M. DIALLO, AT </p><p>A RECEPTION FOR INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>HOSTED BY THE UK HIGH COMMISSIONER THE EVENING OF </p><p>OCTOBER 19. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WE SHALL PROVIDE OUR COMMENTS SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TITUS </p><p></p></div>
