<p>UNCLAS STATE 213164 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, ETRD, SADC </p><p>SUBJECT: PULLING THE RCSA PLUG ON SADC </p><p> </p><p>REFS A) GABORONE 1179    B) STATE 175988 </p><p> </p><p>1. WASHINGTON AGENCIES APPRECIATE POSTS\' EFFORTS TO WALK </p><p>BACK SADC\'S DECISION NOT TO ACCEPT USG FUNDS FOR PROJECTS </p><p>THAT PRECLUDE ZIMBABWEAN PARTICIPATION. WE REGRET THAT </p><p>SADC COULD NOT ARRIVE AT A TIMELY DECISION THAT WOULD ALLOW </p><p>USAID\'S REGIONAL CENTER FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA (RCSA) TO </p><p>OBLIGATE $22.5 MILLION IN FY03 THROUGH THE SADC </p><p>SECRETARIAT. </p><p> </p><p>2. DEPARTMENT CONCURS IN EMBASSY GABORONE\'S PROPOSAL TO </p><p>SEND THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO THE SADC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, </p><p>SIGNED BY THE AMBASSADOR AS THE SECRETARY OF STATE\'S </p><p>SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO SADC. </p><p> </p><p>DEAR DR. RAMSAMY: </p><p> </p><p>AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED ON MANY OCCASIONS, ONE OF THE UNIQUE </p><p>POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE U.S.-SADC RELATIONSHIP WAS THE </p><p>PRACTICE BY THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA </p><p>(RCSA) OF OBLIGATING ITS ANNUAL PROGRAM BUDGET OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION/YEAR THROUGH THE SADC </p><p>SECRETARIAT. </p><p> </p><p>THIS EXERCISE, UNPRECEDENTED IN OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER </p><p>REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN AFRICA, HIGHLIGHTED THE SHARED </p><p>GOALS OF SADC AND THE USG FOR THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE WE HOPED VERY MUCH TO CONTINUE THIS PRACTICE, WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE SECRETARIAT IS UNABLE TO CONFIRM SADC\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO DO SO. BECAUSE OF TIME CONSTRAINTS RELATED </p><p>TO THE CLOSING OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, WE ARE UNABLE TO WAIT </p><p>ANY LONGER FOR A SADC DETERMINATION. I AM THEREFORE </p><p>INFORMING YOU THAT RCSA WILL OBLIGATE ITS FUNDS IN A </p><p>DIFFERENT MANNER THIS YEAR AND IN THE FUTURE. THIS </p><p>DECISION MAY ALSO AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE </p><p>TECHNICAL AND OTHER SUPPORT TO THE SADC SECRETARIAT. </p><p> </p><p>WE DEEPLY REGRET THAT SADC HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FIND, AS WE </p><p>HAVE DISCUSSED IN THE PAST, A WAY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH </p><p>THE UNITED STATES IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES POSED BY THE </p><p>SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE. WHILE THIS HAS CONSTRAINED THE </p><p>WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USG AND SADC, WE HOPE TO </p><p>CONTINUE OUR POSITIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE SADC SECRETARIAT IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICA\'S REGIONAL GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>                       SINCERELY. </p><p> </p><p>                       JOSEPH HUGGINS </p><p>                       SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>                       OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO SADC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
