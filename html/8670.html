(U) In his May 29 inaugural speech, President Obasanjo </p><p>highlighted corruption, infrastructure, power supply, </p><p>industrialization, agriculture, healthcare, and education as </p><p>key issues for his next term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On corruption, the President said he would strengthen </p><p>the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission Act to improve </p><p>the handling of corruption cases in court. He pledged to </p><p>construct more roads and better maintain existing ones and </p><p>said his government aims to increase electrical generation to </p><p>at least 10,000 megawatts a day by 2007. (Note: Current </p><p>installed capacity is 6,000 megawatts a day; however, output </p><p>as of January 2003 fluctuated from around 3,000 to 4,000 </p><p>megawatts a day. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Privatization and assistance to small and medium </p><p>enterprises would be the focus for industrialization policy, </p><p>Obasanjo stated. For the agricultural sector, the President </p><p>said achieving food security through increased crop and </p><p>livestock productivity would be the priority. The President </p><p>also stressed the importance of better marketing strategies </p><p>to improve returns for farmers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The President said more resources will go to hospitals </p><p>and healthcare delivery systems, while in education the GON </p><p>will focus on refurbishing educational institutions and </p><p>implementing the World Bank\'s $101 million Universal Basic </p><p>Education Project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>. . . But Disputes Poverty Figures </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>6. (U) At a May 28 Children\'s Day event in Abuja, President </p><p>Obasanjo disputed claims that 70 percent of Nigerians are </p><p>living in poverty, declaring that such claims by economists </p><p>do not reflect reality. Obasanjo said, "I was told that in </p><p>1992 it was 42 percent of Nigerians and in 1996, it jumped to </p><p>70 percent. I don\'t believe it . . . but if I had been </p><p>informed that it was 42 per cent before the (July 2000 to </p><p>October 2001 IMF) Structural Adjustment Program, and after </p><p>SAP it jumped, I would gladly have accepted it." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) While contesting the poverty figure, Obasanjo </p><p>acknowledged "intolerable poverty among our people both in </p><p>rural and urban areas." However, he said that despite rural </p><p>poverty, "people in villages eat relatively well and also </p><p>have schools to send their children to, have feeder roads and </p><p>dispensaries at their disposal at certain levels." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Comment: Obasanjo\'s questioning of poverty </p><p>statistics and readiness to blame the IMF was an unfortunate </p><p>statement made for domestic political consumption. Coming on </p><p>the eve of his inauguration, Obasanjo may have been </p><p>attempting to shield his previous administration from blame </p><p>for the Nigerian economy\'s poor performance and lack of </p><p>progress in poverty alleviation. The attempt to shift blame </p><p>is understandable but not very helpful. However, while </p><p>Obasanjo may disagree with the actual poverty figures and </p><p>grumble about the IMF, he knows that poverty is a huge </p><p>problem and economic growth is a must. The priorities he </p><p>outlined in his inaugural speech are useful steps to </p><p>alleviate poverty and in line with the Mission\'s economic </p><p>policy recommendations. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Obasanjo Holds Off Naming Cabinet </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>9. (U) The President said he will hold off on formally </p><p>announcing his new Cabinet until the National Assembly </p><p>reconvenes on June 24. Meanwhile, Abuja is buzzing with </p><p>speculation on who will get what roles on Obasanjo\'s new </p><p>economic team. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a Vice President at the World </p><p>Bank, is being considered for the top position at the </p><p>Ministry of Finance. Okonjo-Iweala, educated at Harvard and </p><p>MIT, has been with the World Bank since 1982. In 2000, she </p><p>took time off from the World Bank to assist President </p><p>Obasanjo in establishing a Debt Management Office. Mission </p><p>contacts say Okonjo-Iweala has asked Obasanjo to appoint </p><p>Charles C. Soludo as Chief Economic Advisor. Soludo, now </p><p>Executive Director of the African Institute for Applied </p><p>Economics, has consulted extensively for multilateral </p><p>development organizations as well as USAID. Magnus Kpakol, </p><p>the President\'s former Chief Economic Advisor, has confirmed </p><p>that he will hold a new position devoted exclusively to </p><p>poverty alleviation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Saidu Samaila Sambawa, who lost the Kebbi State </p><p>governor\'s race as the PDP\'s candidate, appears to be slated </p><p>to head the Ministry of Agriculture. Sambawa is an </p><p>accountant, banker, and international businessman who holds a </p><p>Master\'s Degree in Business Administration from the </p><p>University of Wales. Recent press reports, however, indicate </p><p>that Sambawa may be upstaged, as PDP Chairman Audu Ogbeh is </p><p>rumored to be interested in the job. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Julius Ihonvbere is rumored as the new Minister of </p><p>Petroleum Resources. The new portfolio would oversee Nigerian </p><p>National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and manage the </p><p>country\'s participation in OPEC. Ihonvbere is a political </p><p>economist who worked from 1999 to 2002 at the Ford Foundation </p><p>in New York. He returned to Nigeria June 2002 and was </p><p>appointed head of Nigeria\'s Bitumen Implementation Commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON Bans Import of Baryte, Mineral Used for Oil Drilling </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>13. (U) On May 14, GON Minister for Solid Minerals Modupe </p><p>Adelaja announced an import ban on baryte, a mineral form of </p><p>barium sulphate. Baryte is used in oil well drilling to </p><p>counter-act the force of oil and gas when released from the </p><p>ground and prevent their explosion. The mineral is abundant </p><p>throughout Nigeria, according to the Ministry for Solid </p><p>Minerals, and is mined in small quantities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Oil industry contacts tell Econoffs the ban has </p><p>actually been in effect for a year. They say that for a fee </p><p>they have been able to get exemptions from the ban so that </p><p>they can import enough baryte to continue drilling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>World Airways Lands in Lagos </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>15. (U) World Airways, inaugural flight from Atlanta arrived </p><p>in Lagos May 29, ending the Mission\'s five-month advocacy </p><p>campaign on the airline\'s behalf to ensure the GON honored </p><p>our Open Skies Agreement (Refs. A and B). At the arrival </p><p>ceremony, Consul General Hinson-Jones highlighted the U.S. </p><p>role in bolstering safety and security at Nigerian airports </p><p>and lauded the importance of improved passenger and cargo </p><p>links between the two countries. World Airways officials </p><p>commended Mission advocacy efforts during the event. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Comment: World Airways\' and its booking agent </p><p>Ritetime Travel\'s inexperience in Nigeria complicated their </p><p>efforts to obtain landing rights. In early January, World </p><p>advertised service from the United States to Nigeria without </p><p>consulting Minister of Aviation Kema Chikwe. Slighted by the </p><p>presumptive announcement, Chikwe stalled the airline\'s </p><p>approval. The logjam was broken only when Ambassador Jeter </p><p>raised the matter with President Obasanjo. World Airways--now </p><p>positioned to profit from the lucrative U.S.-Nigeria cargo </p><p>and passenger routes, will fly weekly from New York, Atlanta, </p><p>and Houston into Lagos. End Comment. (Note: Several press </p><p>reports indicate that Kema Chikwe will not return to the </p><p>Ministry of Aviation, probably true because she demonstrated </p><p>very little political drawing power in her home state of Imo. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Parallel Market Exchange Rate Premium Widens </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>17. (U) The Central Bank reports that the naira held steady </p><p>against the dollar in April, falling by 8 kobo to 127.77 </p><p>naira per dollar from the March average. Meanwhile, the naira </p><p>depreciated by 1.75 naira to the dollar in the parallel </p><p>market, falling to 138.75. That depreciation widened the </p><p>parallel market premium from 7.6 to 8.5 percent. The naira </p><p>held steady against the dollar in May, closing the month at </p><p>127.82 in the official market and 139.50 in the parallel </p><p>market. Meanwhile, the Central Bank reports that external </p><p>reserves stood at $9.4 billion at the end of April, up from </p><p>7.4 billion just six months ago. </p><p>18. Comment: In keeping steady with the U.S. dollar, the </p><p>naira has weakened against the euro, falling from about 137 </p><p>naira to the euro at the beginning of March to about 152 by </p><p>the end of May. As a result, imported European goods are </p><p>noticeably more expensive. It is unclear to what extent </p><p>inflation, down to a 10.6 percent yearly rate in April, will </p><p>reflect these price increases. Meanwhile, U.S. suppliers may </p><p>exploit a price advantage over their European competitors if </p><p>exchange rates remain steady. End Comment. </p><p>Central Bank Buys U.S. Equipment </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>19. (U) In April 2003, Currency Systems International (CSI), </p><p>a Dallas-based subsidiary of U.K.-based currency printing </p><p>company De La Rue Systems, sold three high-speed banknote </p><p>sorting machines worth $3.43 million to the Central Bank of </p><p>Nigeria. CSI hopes for more sales to the Central Bank and </p><p>plans to provide service and training contracts to the </p><p>Central Bank in the near future. In making the sale, CSI </p><p>broke a 13-year monopoly held by a German firm on sales of </p><p>printing and sorting equipment to the CBN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) CSI and De La Rue\'s Nigerian representatives, </p><p>Interprods Ltd. of Lagos, tell Econoff that the Central Bank </p><p>is poised to acquire more printing and sorting equipment </p><p>later this year. In addition to banknote printing and sorting </p><p>equipment, the Central Bank would require new coin pressing </p><p>and sorting equipment that Interprods says it may source from </p><p>the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) Comment: Nigeria is a cash-based economy, and the </p><p>500 naira note is its highest denomination. This note is </p><p>worth approximately four dollars, making large-scale </p><p>transactions very cumbersome (Ref. A). A 1,000 naira note </p><p>would simplify things to a degree. The Central Bank had plans </p><p>to introduce such a note, but recently scrapped the idea </p><p>citing inopportune economic conditions. For now, economists\' </p><p>concerns that a 1,000 naira note could encourage inflation </p><p>apparently have bested consumers\' demands for convenience, </p><p>but the issue will likely be revisited in the next few years. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
