<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 005296 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND EB/ESC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ENRG, ECON, KU, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: QATAR GAS TO KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 250977 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H Jones for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.(S) Post provides the following responses to questions </p><p>posed in reftel. </p><p> </p><p>2.(S) What are the energy and economic (or political) </p><p>implications for Kuwait if this deal does not go through? </p><p> </p><p>A.) The GOK is facing a significant electicity deficit in the </p><p>next two to three years without significant additions to its </p><p>generation capacity.  The next project due to come online is </p><p>a gas turbine power station which the Kuwaitis hope to </p><p>connect to the grid in 2003, and to power with Qatari gas </p><p>starting in 2005.  The Kuwaitis are also working on two </p><p>significant petrochemical projects, both of which are </p><p>dependent on gas as a feedstock.  If Qatari gas is not </p><p>available, all of these projects are at risk.  The political </p><p>implications of a series of power outages could be quite </p><p>significant. </p><p> </p><p>3.(S) Aside from timing and cost, are there other Kuwaiti </p><p>concerns regarding the source of its supply, e.g., are </p><p>ExxonMobil concerns about losing out to Iranian sources </p><p>credible? </p><p> </p><p>A.) The Kuwaitis have engaged with the Iranians at various </p><p>levels for years for many reasons.  We believe that the </p><p>primary reason for entertaining the Iranians as a potential </p><p>gas supplier was as a bargaining chip to keep the Qataris </p><p>from being too rapacious.  The Kuwaitis will be reluctant to </p><p>rely on the Iranians for gas -- they see the same corruption </p><p>in Iran that we do, and given the confusing array of power </p><p>centers in Iran, they will question the ability of any </p><p>Iranian official to follow-through on a committment. </p><p>However, having said that, many here would find Iran an </p><p>attractive alternative for many reasons, including cost and </p><p>political balance.  In short -- yes, ExxonMobil\'s concern is </p><p>reasonable. </p><p> </p><p>4.(S)  Would Kuwait have no choice but to approach Iran for </p><p>gas? (We note from other reporting that a Kuwaiti delegation </p><p>was scheduled to travel to Tehran presumably to discuss a gas </p><p>deal.) </p><p> </p><p>A.) Kuwait needs gas, as noted above.  After Qatar, Iran is </p><p>clearly the most viable alternative in the short to medium </p><p>term; Iran has the supplies and the distribution network that </p><p>could easily be extended to reach Kuwait.  In the longer </p><p>term, Iraq has the potential to supply Kuwait with gas, but </p><p>there are too many uncertainties for this to be considered as </p><p>a viable opportunity anytime soon. </p><p> </p><p>5.(S) Why has Kuwait not taken an equity interest in this </p><p>project, either upstream or downstream? </p><p> </p><p>A.) Kuwait is currently looking for international oil </p><p>companies to finance the development of its own petroleum </p><p>sector, so it would be unlikely to invest inthe development </p><p>of Qatar\'s energy sector.  ExxonMobil has told us it believes </p><p>the GOK and/or KPC will take some small equity portion in the </p><p>pipeline operator, once the deal is completed. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
