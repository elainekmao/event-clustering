<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 002103 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/PHO, NEA/IPA, WHA/CAN, AND EAP/J </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KPKO, PREL, IS, SY, CA, JA </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDOF: DRAWDOWN OF CANADIAN CONTINGENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 210528 (B) OTTAWA 1779 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canada confirmed to us that is does intend to reduce </p><p>its contribution to the UN Disengagement Observer Force </p><p>(UNDOF) over the next 12 months, but that it will not do so </p><p>before ensuring adequate backfill by others.  We discussed </p><p>reftel (A) concerns with Barbara Martin, Director of Foreign </p><p>Affairs\' Peacekeeping Division, including reports from third </p><p>parties that Canada plans to withdraw from UNDOF.  Martin </p><p>said that Canada has explicitly told UN, Israeli and Syrian </p><p>officials that Canada intends to draw down, but not withdraw </p><p>altogether, from UNDOF.  Martin said Canada hopes to end up </p><p>with approximately 40 "front-line observers" in UNDOF a year </p><p>from now, with Canadian specialty support personnel being </p><p>replaced by other countries, most likely Japan. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Martin emphasized that Canada will not take any steps </p><p>that will undermine the UNDOF mission.  She said the GoC will </p><p>be working closely with the UN to identify backfill, and that </p><p>the drawdown of Canadian personnel will be done in </p><p>consultation with the UN.  She said that Japan has expressed </p><p>interest in playing a more prominent role in UNDOF, and that </p><p>Canada\'s decision should give Japan the impetus to move </p><p>forward.  Canada will continue encouraging Japan to do so, </p><p>and will approach other countries as well if needed. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Martin said that Canada continues to support UNDOF, </p><p>but that there are a number of other countries capable of </p><p>filling the support roles that the Canadian contingent is now </p><p>providing.  After 30 years in UNDOF, Canada is looking to </p><p>free up such specialty personnel for other missions. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Given Canada\'s strong commitment to peace in </p><p>the Middle East, we do not believe it will leave UNDOF in the </p><p>lurch.  We will stay in close touch with the GoC over the </p><p>issue of backfill, and would be interested in USUN and </p><p>Embassy Tokyo\'s thoughts on an increased Japanese role. </p><p>Canada\'s drawdown plans reflect a more general desire to </p><p>rationalize the Canadian Forces\' presence, focusing more on </p><p>higher-impact missions.  They also reflect the fact that the </p><p>Canadian Forces are badly overstretched, a problem that is </p><p>being exacerbated by the deployment of 1800 troops to ISAF. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
