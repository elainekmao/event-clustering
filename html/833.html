<p>S E C R E T ISLAMABAD 005972 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM THOMAS W. SIMONS, JR. </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 7/14/06 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PTER, PINR, PK, IZ, LY, SA, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN, ISLAMIC TERROR AND HUA </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS W. SIMONS, JR., AMBASSADOR. </p><p>REASON:  1.5 (B), (C) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) DURING THE COURSE OF FRANK WISNER\'S AND MY LUNCHEON </p><p>WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ON JULY 12, SHE NOTED THAT SHE WAS </p><p>PICKING UP DISTURBING INTELLIGENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS MADRASSAS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING YOUTH </p><p>TRAINING CAMPS WHICH COULD BE SPAWNING TERRORISM.  THE MOST </p><p>RECENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT INSTITUTIONS OF THIS NATURE ARE </p><p>FUNDED FROM SAUDI ARABIA.  SHE ASSUMES THAT THERE IS PRIVATE </p><p>SAUDI FINANCE INVOLVED, BUT SHE HAS DIRECTED THAT THE SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNMENT BE APPROACHED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) IN THIS CONTEXT SHE EXPRESSED ONCE AGAIN HER SYMPATHY </p><p>FOR THE KILLING OF THE 19 AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND ASKED </p><p>THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH HER IN IDENTIFYING ANY LINES WHICH </p><p>CONNECT WHAT IS GOING ON IN PAKISTAN TO OTHER TERRORIST </p><p>OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  I UNDERTOOK TO DO SO AND ASKED </p><p>THAT THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SHARE WITH US WHATEVER INFORMATION </p><p>IS AVAILABLE TO PAKISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) THE PRIME MINISTER CONTINUED, NOTING THAT THE PROBLEM </p><p>WAS NOT A NEW ONE.  THE IRANIANS, LIBYANS AND IRAQIS HAD IN THE </p><p>PAST FUNDED SIMILAR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.  THE GENERAL </p><p>PROBLEM AS WELL AS INTERNAL SECURITY PROBLEMS HAD BEEN </p><p>DISCUSSED AT A RECENT CABINET MEETING ON LAW AND ORDER WHICH </p><p>SHE HAD CHAIRED.  THE POLITICAL CONTEXT WAS WHAT SHE SAW AS A </p><p>FAIRLY ELABORATE AND WELL ARTICULATED PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THIS PLOT INVOLVES QASI HUSSEIN AHMED, AMIR OF THE </p><p>JAMIAT-I-ISLAMI, BUT ONE OF THE GUIDING FORCES WAS FORMER ISI </p><p>DIRECTOR HAMID GUL.  THE MECHANISM ENVISAGED WAS TO BEGIN WITH </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE BUDGET AND CONSTRUCT AN EVER-BROADENING </p><p>POLITICAL MOVEMENT WITH DEMANDS FOR A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.  ELEMENTS WOULD BE THE </p><p>DEMAND FOR A NEW CENSUS, DEMAND FOR A NATIONAL IDENTITY CARD, </p><p>AND INVOCATION OF ARTICLE 62 OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH LIMITS </p><p>CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE TO THOSE DEFINED AS GOOD MUSLIMS.  THE </p><p>INTENTION WOULD BE TO LIMIT THE DEFINITION OF A GOOD MUSLIM </p><p>ONLY TO GRADUATES OF MADRASSAS OR ISLAMIC UNIVERSITIES.  THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS CATCHING </p><p>ON.  AS SHE HAD EXPLAINED TO THE CABINET MEETING ON LAW AND </p><p>ORDER, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BE SIMPLY THE PASSIVE </p><p>OBJECT OF SUCH A CAMPAIGN BUT WAS OBLIGED TO REACT AND BE </p><p>ACTIVE IN ITS OWN DEFENSE AND IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) THE PRIME MINISTER\'S STATEMENT GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO TURN TO THE VEXING ISSUE OF THE HUA.  I BEGAN BY THANKING </p><p>HER FOR HER VERY FIRM COMMENTS IN HER MEETING WITH THE SPOUSES </p><p>OF THE KASHMIR HOSTAGES.  I RECALLED IN PARTICULAR HER REQUEST </p><p>THAT WE BRING TO HER ATTENTION ANY SOLID INFORMATION THAT WE </p><p>HAVE SO THAT SHE CAN HAVE THE SUSPECTS BROUGHT IN AND STRONGLY </p><p>INTERROGATED.  IN FACT, SHE INTERJECTED, SHE HAD ASKED MINISTER </p><p>OF THE INTERIOR NASEERULLAH KHAN BABAR TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE </p><p>FBI ON THE EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE KASHMIR HOSTAGES.  PAKISTAN </p><p>ITSELF, AFTER THE MOST THOROUGH REVIEW BY ALL AGENCIES OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT -- INTELLIGENCE, ARMY AND CIVILIAN AGENCIES -- HAD </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO DISCOVER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE HARAKAT UL </p><p>ANSAR PEOPLE THAT THEY KNEW AND THE HOSTAGE TAKERS.  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME SHE RECOGNIZED THAT ALL OUTSIDE INTERLOCUTORS WERE </p><p>CONVINCED THAT THERE IS SUCH A CONNECTION.  THE BRITISH HAD </p><p>MADE THIS CLEAR TO THEM AND SHE ASSUMED THAT THE AMERICANS HAD </p><p>THE SAME VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) FRANK WISNER ASSURED HER THAT THAT IS THE CASE, </p><p>OUTLINING BRIEFLY THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE IN HAND ABOUT HUA </p><p>COMPLICITY IN SEVERAL KIDNAPPING EVENTS IN INDIA, INCLUDING THE </p><p>KASHMIR HOSTAGE INCIDENT.  THE PRIME MINISTER SAID SHE COULD </p><p>NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT A BREAKAWAY ELEMENT OF HUA </p><p>MIGHT BE INVOLVED, RECALLING THAT A BREAKAWAY ELEMENT HAD BEEN </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE ARMY PLOT OF SEPTEMBER 1995.  SHE ASKED THE </p><p>FOREIGN SECRETARY TO CONTACT THE MILITARY AND ASK IF ANY OF THE </p><p>HUA PLOTTERS IN THE ARMY COUP WERE AWARE OF PLANS TO TAKE </p><p>HOSTAGES IN KASHMIR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S) WISNER AND I AGREED THAT THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL.  I </p><p>ASKED THE PRIME MINISTER TO DELAY TAKING ACTION WITH BABAR </p><p>ABOUT THE FBI UNTIL JOHN HOLZMAN OR I HAD A CHANCE TO BRING TO </p><p>HER ATTENTION INFORMATION WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED ON </p><p>THE HOSTAGE CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOLZMAN </p><p></p></div>
