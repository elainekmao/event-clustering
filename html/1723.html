SUMMARY:  AFTER 1975, VIETNAM\'S COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT </p><p>CLOSED OR TOOK OVER THE ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS, </p><p>ORPHANAGES, HEALTH FACILITIES, AND OTHER CHARITABLE AND </p><p>SOCIAL FACILITIES IN SAIGON THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN </p><p>MANAGED BY RELIGIOUS OR OTHER PRIVATE ENTITIES.  IN THE </p><p>PAST FEW YEARS IN HCMC, AND IN SOME OTHER PARTS OF </p><p>VIETNAM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALLOWED A QUIET BUT REAL </p><p>RESURGENCE IN BOTH THE NUMBER AND THE ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>DOMESTIC, USUALLY RELIGIOUS, NGOS.  ALTHOUGH THESE </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ACT OUTSIDE OF DIRECT GOVERNMENT CONTROL, </p><p>SOME ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A GOVERNMENT OR PARTY AGENCY. </p><p>THE EMERGENCE OF SUCH GROUPS PROBABLY REPRESENTS A GROWING </p><p>TOLERANCE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS A </p><p>GROWING RECOGNITION OF GOVERNMENT INABILITY TO MEET THE </p><p>CHARITABLE AND SOCIAL NEEDS OF THE CITY.  THIS REPORT </p><p>PROFILES SOME OF THE NGO\'S ENGAGED IN CHARITABLE AND </p><p>SOCIAL WORK IN HCMC.  GROUPS SUCH AS THESE, ESTABLISHED BY </p><p>AND EMPLOYING PERSONS WITH A GENUINE ENTHUSIASM FOR WHAT </p><p>THEY ARE DOING, MAY EVENTUALLY HELP VIETNAM CREATE A MORE </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO </p><p>CHARITABLE NEEDS AND SOCIAL CAUSES WITHOUT FEAR OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT IMPEDIMENTS OR PUNISHMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00648  01 OF 03  300321Z </p><p> </p><p>FRIEND TO FRIEND CLUB </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. A FEW YEARS AGO, A HCMC HEROIN ADDICT (WHO PREFERRED </p><p>NOT TO GIVE HIS NAME TO POLOFF) DISCOVERED HE WAS HIV- </p><p>POSITIVE.  RATHER THAN SUCCUMB TO FEELINGS OF DESPAIR, HE </p><p>GAVE UP HIS HABIT COLD TURKEY, FOUND A FRIEND WHO SHARED </p><p>THE SAME FATE, AND THE TWO OF THEM BEGAN TALKING WITH </p><p>OTHER HEROIN ADDICTS THEY KNEW ABOUT THE DANGERS OF NEEDLE- </p><p>SHARING.  BEING FORMER ADDICTS, THEY WERE ABLE TO STRIKE </p><p>CHORDS IN THEIR LISTENERS THAT GOVERNMENT OUTREACH </p><p>PROGRAMS SIMPLY COULD NOT DO.  THEY ENCOURAGED THEIR </p><p>LISTENERS TO GIVE UP THEIR ADDICTIONS IF THEY COULD, BUT </p><p>THEIR MAIN MESSAGE WAS TO STOP THE PRACTICE OF SHARING </p><p>NEEDLES.  SOON THEY BEGAN HOLDING MEETINGS AT A ROW HOUSE </p><p>ON A SIDE STREET IN PHU NHUAN DISTRICT, CLANDESTINE </p><p>MEETINGS, SINCE A GROUP OF HEROIN ADDICTS MEETING TOGETHER </p><p>AND DISTRIBUTING CLEAN NEEDLES WOULD INVITE ARREST BY </p><p>LOCAL POLICE.  OTHER ADDICTS AND FORMER ADDICTS </p><p>VOLUNTEERED TO HELP.  THEY CREATED A GROUP CALLED "FRIEND </p><p>TO FRIEND CLUB." </p><p> </p><p>3. TODAY FRIEND TO FRIEND IS FORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE </p><p>HCMC AIDS COMMITTEE FROM WHICH IT RECEIVES FUNDING.  IT </p><p>HAS A STAFF OF 15 WHO RECEIVE A LIMITED SALARY AND A </p><p>VOLUNTEER FORCE OF 100.  MOST OF THE VOLUNTEERS ARE HIV- </p><p>POSITIVE AND THREE QUARTERS OF THEM ARE LESS THAN 25 YEARS </p><p>OLD.  THE VOLUNTEERS GO HOUSE-TO-HOUSE, TO HOSPITALS, AND </p><p>BY INVITATION, TO SCHOOLS, TO GIVE SUPPORT TO PEOPLE WHO </p><p>HAVE HIV/AIDS, THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS, AND/OR CAREGIVERS AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00648  01 OF 03  300321Z </p><p>TO GIVE ADVICE TO THOSE WHO ARE AT RISK OF ACQUIRING THE </p><p>DISEASE.  THEY CONTINUE TO HOLD MONTHLY MEETINGS AND TO BE </p><p>A SUPPORT GROUP FOR HEROIN ADDICTS.  THEIR ASSOCIATION </p><p>WITH THE AIDS COMMITTEE HAS GIVEN THEM THE CAPABILITY TO </p><p>OPERATE MORE OPENLY AND WITHOUT FEAR OF POLICE </p><p>INTERVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>THANH XUAN SHELTER FOR GIRLS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. TWO CATHOLIC NUNS ESTABLISHED A SHELTER IN 1996 IN </p><p>HCMC\'S BINH THANH DISTRICT FOR YOUNG GIRLS WHO HAVE </p><p>EXPERIENCED LABOR EXPLOITATION OR SEXUAL ABUSE.  TODAY, </p><p>THE SHELTER IS OPERATED BY SEVERAL CATHOLIC NUNS AND LAY </p><p>PERSONS AND IS HOME TO 22 GIRLS FROM THE AGES OF SIX TO </p><p>FOURTEEN.  THE GIRLS ARE EITHER ORPHANS OR COME FROM POOR </p><p>FAMILIES WITH NEGLECTFUL, ABUSIVE OR EXPLOITATIVE PARENTS. </p><p>(SOME OF THE PARENTS HAVE FORCED OR SOLD THEIR CHILDREN </p><p>INTO PROSTITUTION.)  AT THE SHELTER, THE GIRLS ARE </p><p>PROVIDED FOOD, CLOTHING, AN EDUCATION AND A PLACE TO LIVE. </p><p>RECOGNIZING THAT THE CHILDREN OFTEN COME FROM BACKGROUNDS </p><p>WHERE THE NOTION OF "TRUST" HAS BEEN SHATTERED, THE NUNS </p><p>AND LAYPERSONS AT THE SHELTER STRESS INTERDEPENDENCE BY </p><p>HAVING THE CHILDREN SHARE RESPONSIBILITIES IN HOUSEHOLD </p><p>WORK, HELPING EACH OTHER TO LEARN IN THE CLASSROOM, AND </p><p>PLAYING TOGETHER.  THE SHELTER HAS AN INFORMAL ASSOCIATION </p><p>WITH THE HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY YOUTH UNION, WHICH PROVIDES </p><p>COUNSELING TO THE GIRLS TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS </p><p>IN SEXUALLY EXPLOITATIVE SITUATIONS.  IT ALSO IS </p><p>ASSOCIATED INFORMALLY WITH THE HCMC WORK INSTITUTE, WHICH </p><p>PROVIDES THE GIRLS WITH SOME TRAINING IN COMPUTER </p><p>LITERACY, EMBROIDERY/SEWING, AND HAIR STYLING. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE GOAL OF THE THANH XUAN SHELTER IS TO REUNITE THE </p><p>CHILDREN WITH THEIR FAMILIES UNDER THE CONDITION THAT BOTH </p><p>PARTIES ARE WILLING AND ACCEPTING OF ONE ANOTHER. </p><p>ALTHOUGH 12 OF THE GIRLS ARE ORPHANS OR OTHERWISE CANNOT </p><p>BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES, OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, </p><p>24 GIRLS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN REUNITED WITH FAMILY AND </p><p>LOVED ONES.  FUNDING FOR THE SHELTER COMES COMPLETELY FROM </p><p>PRIVATE DONATIONS, USUALLY FROM INDIVIDUALS. </p><p> </p><p>FRIENDS FOR STREET CHILDREN ASSOCIATION </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. IN 1993, A CATHOLIC WOMAN TOOK THREE HOMELESS CHILDREN </p><p>INTO HER HOME IN THU DUC DISTRICT.  BY THE END OF 1995, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00648  02 OF 03  300321Z </p><p>SHE HAD TAKEN IN FOUR OTHER HOMELESS CHILDREN AND BEGAN </p><p>TEACHING READING AND WRITING CLASSES TO THEM AND 13 OTHER </p><p>CHILDREN IN THE DISTRICT WHOSE FAMILIES WERE UNABLE TO </p><p>AFFORD SCHOOL FEES AND BOOKS.  IN 1997, THE WOMAN AND HER </p><p>SCHOOL BECAME A PART OF "FRIENDS FOR STREET CHILDREN," A </p><p>CATHOLIC ORGANIZATION ESTABLISHED IN 1993 THAT RAN THREE </p><p>OTHER SIMILAR SCHOOLS, THE OLDEST OF WHICH DATED BACK TO </p><p>1984.  TODAY, FRIENDS FOR STREET CHILDREN MANAGES AND </p><p>OPERATES SEVEN DEVELOPMENT CENTERS, WHICH ARE, IN FACT, </p><p>SCHOOLS FOR CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES TOO POOR TO AFFORD </p><p>MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS.  IT HAS A STAFF OF ABOUT 50 SOCIAL </p><p>WORKERS, EDUCATORS AND NUNS, MOST OF WHOM ARE VOLUNTEERS. </p><p> </p><p>7. IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ATTENDING </p><p>FRIENDS\' DEVELOPMENT CENTERS INCREASED FROM 520 TO 812. </p><p>ABOUT 160 OF THE CHILDREN LIVE ON THE GROUNDS OF THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND WOULD OTHERWISE SLEEP ON THE </p><p>STREETS.  THE OTHER CHILDREN LIVE AT HOME, BUT ATTEND </p><p>CLASSES (AND ARE PROVIDED A MEAL) AT THE CENTERS.  THE </p><p>CENTER IN THU DUC DISTRICT IS NOW HOME TO 29 CHILDREN </p><p>WHILE 76 OTHERS ATTEND CLASSES THERE.  THE STAFF OF TWELVE </p><p>TEACHERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS INCLUDES THREE DOMINICAN NUNS. </p><p>IT IS THE GOAL OF FRIENDS FOR STREET CHILDREN TO PREVENT </p><p>THEIR VULNERABLE STUDENTS FROM BECOMING STREET CHILDREN BY </p><p>PROVIDING A BASIC EDUCATION AS WELL AS VOCATIONAL TRAINING </p><p>IN EMBROIDERY, TAILORING, HANDICRAFTS, CARPENTRY AND </p><p>COMPUTER CLASSES.  FUNDING IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON LOCAL </p><p>INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS, BUT FRIENDS DOES GET SUPPORT FROM </p><p>SOME INTERNATIONAL DONORS IN FRANCE AND JAPAN. </p><p> </p><p>HOUSE OF LOVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00648  02 OF 03  300321Z </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. THE HOUSE OF LOVE IS AN ORPHANAGE MANAGED AND OPERATED </p><p>BY ONE BUDDHIST MONK AND ELEVEN BUDDHIST NUNS WHO RESIDE </p><p>AT THE DIEU GIAC PAGODA IN HCMC\'S DISTRICT TWO.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THERE ARE SEVEN PAID STAFF (TEACHERS AND SOCIAL </p><p>WORKERS) AND TWELVE LAY VOLUNTEERS.  THE ORPHANAGE WAS </p><p>ESTABLISHED IN 1989 FOR NEWBORN BABIES WHO WERE ABANDONED </p><p>AT THE PAGODA (WHICH IS LOCATED IN ONE OF THE CITY\'S </p><p>POOREST AREAS).  OF THE 101 CHILDREN CURRENTLY RESIDING AT </p><p>THE ORPHANAGE, 30 ARE THREE YEARS OLD OR LESS AND 71 ARE </p><p>FROM 4 TO 11 YEARS OLD.  SEVENTY-NINE WERE ABANDONED AT </p><p>THE ORPHANAGE, TEN ARE ORPHANED, AND THE REMAINING TWELVE </p><p>GIVEN OVER TO THE ORPHANAGE FOR VARIOUS REASONS.  ABOUT </p><p>HALF ARE GIRLS AND HALF ARE BOYS.  THE ORPHANAGE SENDS </p><p>SOME OF ITS RESIDENTS TO MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS, BUT ALSO </p><p>PROVIDES PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASSES ON ITS PREMISES.  FUNDING </p><p>FOR THE OPERATION OF THIS ORPHANAGE COMES ENTIRELY FROM </p><p>INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE DONATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER CHARITIES </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. A CATHOLIC NUN IN BINH THANH DISTRICT RUNS AN </p><p>ORPHANAGE FOR AUTISTIC AND MENTALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN. </p><p>ANOTHER CATHOLIC NUN MANAGES AN ORPHANAGE AND SCHOOL FOR </p><p>POOR CHILDREN FROM ONE TO EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD IN THONG NHAT </p><p>DISTRICT IN DONG NAI PROVINCE.  A GROUP OF DOCTORS AND </p><p>NURSES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE BEN SAN LEPROSY TREATMENT </p><p>CENTER IN BINH DUONG PROVINCE.  A PRIVATE GROUP OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS OPERATES A HOME/SCHOOL FOR 44 BLIND PEOPLE </p><p>(AGED 5 TO 29 YEARS) IN HCMC\'S DISTRICT TEN.  TWO WOMEN, </p><p>ONE VIETNAMESE AND ONE WESTERN, RUN A SHELTER FOR HOMELESS </p><p>GIRLS IN HCMC\'S DISTRICT FOUR.  A PRIVATE GROUP OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS CALLING THEMSELVES "CARE FOR CHILDREN IN </p><p>ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES" MANAGE A SHELTER FOR </p><p>SEXUALLY ABUSED GIRLS AGED 12 TO 16 AND AN ORPHANAGE AND </p><p>SCHOOL FOR 100 CHILDREN AGED 6 TO 16 IN DISTRICT FOUR. </p><p>THE CATHOLIC DAUGHTERS OF CHARITY OPERATE SEVERAL </p><p>KINDERGARTENS IN HCMC, AND PRIESTS ASSOCIATED WITH NOTRE </p><p>DAME CATHEDRAL IN HCMC HAVE ESTABLISHED A SCHOOL FOR THE </p><p>DEAF AND DUMB IN THE MEKONG DELTA. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.

THE ABOVE SHOULD SUFFICE, HOWEVER, </p><p>TO POINT OUT THAT THE NUMBER OF NGO\'S IN HCMC AND THE GOOD </p><p>WORKS THEY ARE ACCOMPLISHING ARE ON THE RISE.  POST </p><p>APPLAUDS THE LENIENT MANNER IN WHICH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS PERMITTED THESE NGO\'S TO OPERATE AND LOOKS FORWARD TO </p><p>THE DAY WHEN A CIVIL SOCIETY COMPRISED OF MANY DIFFERENT </p><p>NON-GOVERNMENT ACTORS, PRIVATE CITIZENS AND PRIVATE </p><p>GROUPS, BECOMES A REALITY IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
