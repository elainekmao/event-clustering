<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004337 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/IPA, NEA/RA AND PRM/ANE </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, KPAL, KWBG, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRWA PLANS EXTRAORDINARY, HIGH-LEVEL MEETING IN </p><p>GENEVA FOR SPRING 2004; HOPES TO ADDRESS FUTURE OF AGENCY </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 3242 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM David Hale, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an action request; see para 8. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and action request:  On July 7, UNRWA briefed </p><p>Amman-based donors and host government representatives on its </p><p>plans to hold an extraordinary, possibly ministerial-level </p><p>meeting in Geneva in spring 2004.  While UNRWA initially </p><p>hoped to hold the meeting in November 2003, UNRWA agreed that </p><p>the November date was premature after donors argued that a </p><p>great deal of work would be required to plan an effective </p><p>meeting.  UNRWA hopes that a high-level meeting held outside </p><p>the region will enable the cash-strapped agency to gain both </p><p>greater media and donor attention, and believes that a </p><p>political agenda, such as the discussion of the future of the </p><p>agency is required to attract such attention.  To prepare for </p><p>this extraordinary meeting, UNRWA will hold regular "steering </p><p>committee" meetings of stakeholders in Jerusalem and Amman, </p><p>with the next meeting scheduled for late July.  UNRWA will </p><p>finalize the agenda and dates for the Geneva extraordinary </p><p>meeting at the next major donors meeting, September 23-24 in </p><p>Amman.  We are concerned that a spring 2004, high-level </p><p>meeting focused on UNRWA\'s future could be both premature and </p><p>disruptive to the Israel/Palestinian roadmap process, a </p><p>concern shared by host governments.   Department\'s guidance </p><p>on the planned meeting is requested.  End summary and action </p><p>request. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>UNRWA Plans High-Level Policy Meeting </p><p>In Hopes of Attracting More Funds </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On July 7, UNRWA briefed Amman-based donors and </p><p>host government representatives on its plans to hold an </p><p>extraordinary, possibly ministerial-level meeting in Geneva. </p><p>Plans for a Geneva meeting were first announced by ComGen </p><p>Peter Hansen at UNRWA\'s May 21-22 meeting of major donors and </p><p>host governments (ref), without any reference to the </p><p>meeting\'s agenda or desired level of participation.  At the </p><p>July 7 meeting, UNRWA External Relations Director Andrew </p><p>Whitley explained that the agency hopes a high-level meeting </p><p>held outside the region will enable UNRWA to gain both </p><p>greater media and donor attention, acknowledging that a very </p><p>different -- and possibly political -- agenda would be </p><p>required to attract such attention.  According to Whitley, </p><p>UNRWA ComGen Hansen has suggested that an extraordinary, </p><p>high-level meeting should be used to develop a common vision </p><p>for UNRWA\'s future in light of renewed momentum toward peace. </p><p> UNRWA also hopes to showcase the "synergy" among UN agencies </p><p>and plans to hold workshops with Geneva-based UN agencies on </p><p>areas of mutual concern.  (Comment:  We have not seen </p><p>evidence of such synergy in the field, with the exception of </p><p>the West Bank and Gaza\'s Bertini assessment and report in </p><p>2002.)  The Swiss Government has agreed to pay some of the </p><p>costs of this extraordinary meeting and has told us privately </p><p>that the specific amount remains under negotiation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) While UNRWA initially hoped to hold the meeting in </p><p>November 2003 in place of the regularly scheduled September </p><p>major donors meeting, the agency agreed at the July 7 meeting </p><p>that the November date was premature and postponed the </p><p>extraordinary meeting until spring 2004.  Donors and host </p><p>governments both expressed concern that UNRWA did not have a </p><p>specific enough agenda or sense of what it wanted to </p><p>accomplish in the extraordinary meeting to hold it in </p><p>November.  (The only specific themes identified by UNRWA </p><p>were:  how the West Bank and Gaza could move from conflict to </p><p>recovery and development; and the future of UNRWA in light of </p><p>renewed momentum toward peace.)  Some donors, including </p><p>refcoord, also expressed concern that a November meeting </p><p>could be too early to assess the full impact of roadmap </p><p>implementation on UNRWA and its future. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Host Governments Fear Meeting Could Disrupt Roadmap </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Host government representatives later told refcoord </p><p>they also are concerned about the timing and agenda of the </p><p>planned extraordinary meeting.  GOJ Department of Palestinian </p><p>Affairs Director General Abulkarim Abulhaija said the GOJ </p><p>worries that a high-profile, high-level meeting to discuss </p><p>UNRWA\'s future could in fact prove disruptive to the roadmap, </p><p>as refugees throughout the region would interpret it as </p><p>creating "facts on the ground" before all parties agree on a </p><p>solution to the refugee question.  PLO Refugee Affairs </p><p>Representative Mohamed Abu Bakr echoed these concerns, </p><p>telling refcoord that UNRWA should "keep its distance from </p><p>politics," especially while roadmap implementation remained </p><p>"delicate." </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>UNRWA Resists Look at Agency Management </p><p>In Extraordinary Meeting </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) At the July 7 UNRWA meeting, refcoord suggested </p><p>that UNRWA could use an extraordinary meeting to take a fresh </p><p>look at its governing and management structure and take stock </p><p>of management reforms to date.  A strategic meeting on the </p><p>future of the agency must address management concerns, as new </p><p>policies cannot be implemented without appropriate management </p><p>procedures.  If UNRWA believes it will be in the position to </p><p>address the future of the agency, it also should be in a </p><p>position to address the internal changes UNRWA must make, </p><p>such as decentralization of authority from headquarters to </p><p>the fields, in order to eventually phase out operations (and </p><p>presumably hand some over to local government authorities). </p><p>UNRWA External Relations Director Whitley bristled at the </p><p>suggestion, stating flatly that internal UNRWA management </p><p>procedures were not appropriate topics for a strategic policy </p><p>meeting. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>UNRWA Will Begin Planning for Geneva Meeting </p><p>In Late July </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Whitley invited donors and host governments to </p><p>suggest topics for the extraordinary meeting and said the </p><p>agency would organize regular "steering committee" meetings </p><p>of stakeholders in Jerusalem and Amman to further develop </p><p>ideas for the Geneva meeting.  Refcoord expressed concern </p><p>that not all host governments would be able to attend </p><p>meetings in Jerusalem, adding that host government </p><p>participation in the planning process would be crucial to the </p><p>success of a high-level policy meeting.  Whitley noted </p><p>refcoord\'s concerns and said UNRWA would consider holding all </p><p>steering committee meetings in Amman.  He hopes to hold the </p><p>next meeting in late July.  Whitley added that UNRWA plans to </p><p>finalize the agenda and dates for the Geneva extraordinary </p><p>meeting at the next major donors meeting, scheduled for </p><p>September 23-24 in Amman. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) UNRWA seems to be fishing for a "hook" to attract </p><p>media, higher-level representation and more funds to a future </p><p>donor meeting and has decided the roadmap provides precisely </p><p>such a hook.  While we agree that UNRWA is in need of a </p><p>higher donor profile, we believe that a ministerial-level </p><p>meeting to discuss the post-roadmap future of the agency is </p><p>not the appropriate vehicle.  Such a policy-focused meeting </p><p>is inappropriate for a UN implementing agency and would prove </p><p>unnecessarily provocative to the refugees and disruptive to </p><p>the political process.  Unless donors and host governments </p><p>present formal positions on the planned spring 2004 meeting, </p><p>UNRWA will assume it has full stakeholder approval to move </p><p>ahead on a high-level, politically oriented meeting in </p><p>Geneva.  Hansen\'s personal support for and involvement in </p><p>planning this meeting will make it particularly difficult to </p><p>turn off.  We therefore request the Department\'s guidance on </p><p>whether a high-level UNRWA policy meeting would be </p><p>appropriate in spring 2004 and, if so, what topics the U.S. </p><p>would be prepared to accept on the agenda. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) ConGen Jerusalem cleared this message. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
