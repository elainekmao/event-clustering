<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004420 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, July 17, focuses on </p><p>the convening of the newly-elected Jordanian </p><p>parliament in its "extraordinary session" held July </p><p>16.  Reports highlight the "hotly contested" election </p><p>of Saad Hayel Srour as Speaker of the Lower House with </p><p>a majority of 65 votes, our of 110 total.  Other lead </p><p>stories focus on Iraq, highlighting further attacks </p><p>against U.S. soldiers.  Front-page stories also report </p><p>that Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas is </p><p>scheduled to meet President Bush in Washington D.C. on </p><p>July 25. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Iraq first" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(07/17):  "There is a large gap that is hard to bridge </p><p>between the political and intellectual trends in Iraq </p><p>and the Arab world..  Representatives of the </p><p>prevailing political tendencies in Iraq are meeting </p><p>with Bremer today as part of the interim governing </p><p>council to discuss the future of the country and its </p><p>people, without fear of being labeled as agents or </p><p>servants of the American master, and even without </p><p>relevance to what the Arab media calls `Iraqi </p><p>resistance operations,\' but which these Iraqis view as </p><p>sabotage.  On the other hand, the trend in the Arab </p><p>world outside Iraq is to view what is going on in Iraq </p><p>as part of a long-term occupation.  Thus, the council </p><p>is seen as a dirty game to decorate the ugly face of </p><p>the occupier, and the operations against the American </p><p>forces are seen as the Nation\'s desire to fight and </p><p>resist , even as another face of the Palestinian </p><p>Intifada and its suicide operations..  The difference </p><p>between the Iraqis and their counterparts in the Arab </p><p>world reflects the phenomenon of Iraq\'s separation </p><p>from the Arab nation.  It also reflects the failure of </p><p>the Arab political and intellectual trends to </p><p>understand the nuances of the Iraqi scene." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A victory turns into a defeat" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(07/17):  "After completing the occupation of Iraq and </p><p>the military operations, some of the American troops </p><p>were supposed to return to their bases.  In reality, </p><p>however, U.S. Governor of Iraq, Bremer, is requesting </p><p>more American troops to enable him to take control of </p><p>Iraq in view of the resistance that the occupation is </p><p>facing.  General Tommy Franks needed 150,000 soldiers </p><p>to defeat the former regime, but he will need half a </p><p>million soldiers to maintain security and face up to </p><p>the popular resistance.  Defeating nations is easy and </p><p>not very costly, but defeating the people is very </p><p>difficult and quite costly.. Winning wars requires not </p><p>only firepower, but also legitimacy.  The war that </p><p>America launched against Iraq did not lack firepower, </p><p>but the war was not legitimate.  It was immoral and </p><p>aggressive and, hence, it was defeated even before it </p><p>began." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Resistance, but." </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Hilmi Al-Asmar writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Dustour (07/17):  "The Iraqi resistance to the </p><p>American occupation forces is legitimate resistance, </p><p>but it does not enjoy the support of all the Iraqis.. </p><p>We salute the Iraqi resistance and we love to hear </p><p>news of operations [against American forces].  But at </p><p>the same time, we cannot label someone a `traitor\' </p><p>that does not choose this path, but rather decides to </p><p>`go along with\' the status quo." </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
