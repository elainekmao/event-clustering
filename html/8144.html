Under headline "Iron fist will fail" the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated its May </p><p>      19 editorial to the expulsion of Andrew Meldrum, a </p><p>      United States national and correspondent for the </p><p>      British newspaper "The Guardian." The editorial said </p><p>      Meldrum\'s ejection was "ill-advised and unlawful" and </p><p>      that "the government\'s crude actions will not silence </p><p>      Meldrum or other journalists."  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The government of Zimbabwe has yet again </p><p>      contrived to make an international spectacle of itself </p><p>      with its ill-advised and unlawful deportation of </p><p>      Guardian journalist Andrew Meldrum. . .  It is tragic </p><p>      for the nation that the government fails to realize, </p><p>      or simply does not care, that its iron-fisted response </p><p>      to its citizen\'s attempts to express basic rights that </p><p>      they are guaranteed by the Constitution is fuelling </p><p>      the tension it prefers, ostrich-like, not to see. . . </p><p>      Through its deportation of Meldrum, President Robert </p><p>      Mugabe\'s regime has merely added to the list of </p><p>      journalists who are determined to tell the true story </p><p>      of Zimbabwe, even if they have to do it from beyond </p><p>      the country\'s borders.  The government\'s crude actions </p><p>      will not silence Meldrum or other journalists. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
