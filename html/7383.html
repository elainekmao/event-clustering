<p>S E C R E T OTTAWA 001065 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, CA, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI EMBASSY IN CANADA </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 93783 (B) OTTAWA 801 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) We discussed reftel (A) demarche with Chris Hull, </p><p>Foreign Affairs Desk Officer for Iraq, on April 11.  Hull </p><p>told us that the GoC continues to monitor closely the </p><p>activities of the one Iraqi diplomat remaining in country, </p><p>Charge Mamdouh Mustafa, and had no indication that he was </p><p>destroying Iraqi Government records or property.  Hull noted </p><p>that the GoC was looking for an opportunity to remove items </p><p>of an "undiplomatic nature" (nfi) from the premises of the </p><p>Iraqi Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Mustafa, Hull continued, has given no indication of </p><p>his future plans.  Hull saw no basis for him to be granted </p><p>refugee status, but said that if Mustafa makes such a claim </p><p>he could remain in Canada while his case is being reviewed. </p><p>The GoC could also decide to declare him persona non grata. </p><p>The RCMP is providing security for the Iraqi Embassy and is </p><p>escorting Mustafa due to concerns about potential </p><p>demonstrators. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) COMMENT: The GoC has been very helpful to us in </p><p>working with Mustafa, and we have concurred with their </p><p>reasons for not expelling him from Canada (ref. B).  The GoC </p><p>is now taking a wait-and-see approach on how to deal with </p><p>him.  The Foreign Affairs spokesperson has said it would be </p><p>up to the new Iraqi Government to decide whether to withdraw </p><p>current diplomats. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
