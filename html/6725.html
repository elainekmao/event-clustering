<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001230 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, ENRG, EAID, IT, IZ, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ITALY TO ESTABLISH IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>    REF: A. STATE 65142 </p><p>     B. ROME 1217 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECON M/C SCOTT KILNER, REASONS 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A MARCH 21 MEETING WITH POL MINCOUNS AND ECONOFF, </p><p>ANTONIO BADINI, THE ITALIAN MFA\'S DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, SAID THAT HE WOULD ESTABLISH AN INTER-AGENCY </p><p>TASK FORCE ON IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING HIS TRIP THIS </p><p>WEEK TO WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK.  BADINI HAS YET TO ESTABLISH </p><p>THE FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TASK </p><p>FORCE BUT IS LOOKING TO HIS MEETINGS IN THE U.S. AS A WAY TO </p><p>LEARN FROM THE USG\'S "METHODOLOGY" OF COORDINATING IRAQ </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION.  BADINI DESCRIBED THE GOI\'S INTEREST IN BROAD </p><p>ENGAGEMENT OVER THE NEAR- AND MEDIUM-TERM TO INCLUDE </p><p>POST-CONFLICT SUPPORT, HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND EVENTUALLY </p><p>COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WHILE BADINI DID NOT SPECIFY AMOUNTS OF MONETARY </p><p>ASSISTANCE, HE DID MENTION THAT SPECIAL FINANCIAL MEASURES </p><p>WOULD BE TAKEN TO SECURE NECESSARY FUNDS.  MEANWHILE, BADINI </p><p>WAS SUPPORTIVE REGARDING SUCH GOI CONTRIBUTIONS OF </p><p>SPECIALISTS IN BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS AS MIGHT BE </p><p>NEEDED IN THE IMMEDIATE POST-WAR PHASE (REF A), SAYING "WE </p><p>SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THAT FOR SURE."  BADINI ALSO AGREED ON </p><p>THE NEED TO BE ATTENTIVE TO TURKEY\'S PRIOR COMMITMENT TO </p><p>RESPECT THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF IRAQ.  BADINI ALSO </p><p>SHARED HIS PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ENCOURAGING STRONGER USG </p><p>ENGAGEMENT WITH, AND REASSURANCES FOR, IRAN AND SYRIA </p><p>(REPORTED SEPTEL, REF B). </p><p> </p><p>    3.  (C) COMMENT: BADINI CLEARLY WANTS TO USE HIS VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON ON MARCH 24 AND 25 AND TO NEW YORK ON MARCH 26 AND </p><p>27 AS A POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR BUILDING THE GOI\'S IRAQ </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION TASK FORCE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO INTERFACE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY WITH USG AND UN ORGANIZATIONS.  HE IS EAGER TO </p><p>LEARN FROM OUR OWN COORDINATION EFFORTS AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW </p><p>ITALY CAN HELP IN A RANGE OF AREAS FROM NON-COMBAT TROOPS TO </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO SALVAGING FORMER COMMERCIAL </p><p>CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED IN RECENT YEARS.  BADINI </p><p>MADE CLEAR THAT HE WANTED TO BE SURE THAT ITALIAN INTERESTS </p><p>WERE FAIRLY REPRESENTED IN THE POST-WAR PERIOD, ALBEIT IN A </p><p>WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH IRAQ\'S POST-WAR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>NEEDS.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01230 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
