<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 000600 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MARR, IT, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN MINDEF MARTINO PROVIDES ASSURANCES ON FLOW </p><p>OF FORCES </p><p></p><p>REF: A. ROME 0572 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 40983 </p><p>     C. MRG 1000823Z FEB 03 </p><p>     D. ROME 0292 </p><p>     E. ROME 331 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR MEL SEMBLER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE SEE ACTION REQUESTS IN PARAS 9 AND 10. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  SUMMARY.  ITALIAN MINDEF MARTINO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 12 THAT THE GOI WOULD NOT LET THE U.S. DOWN ON </p><p>FLOW OF FORCES AND OTHER USG LOGISTICAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED </p><p>TO POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ.  PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI IS COMMITTED TO MEETING ITALY\'S RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>(NOTE: REF B WILL BE A TEST OF THIS COMMITMENT).  MARTINO </p><p>SAID THE GOI UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF FORCE PROTECTION </p><p>AND WILL DECIDE SOON ON WHAT ITALY CAN DO WITH ITS OWN FORCES </p><p>TO ASSIST.   MARTINO ADMITTED THAT THE GOI HAD SET THE BAR </p><p>TOO LOW IN TAKING CERTAIN U.S. REQUESTS TO PARLIAMENT AND </p><p>SAID HE MAY BE ABLE TO RAISE THE THRESHOLD.  REVERSING </p><p>COURSE, THE MINDEF SAID HE WAS WILLING TO RECONSIDER THE USE </p><p>OF ITALIAN CIVILIAN AIRPORTS FOR U.S. CIVAIR TRANSPORT OF </p><p>MILITARY PERSONNEL "IF IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE USG."  ASKED BY </p><p>MARTINO IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DELAY UPGRADES TO THE NAVAL </p><p>BASE IN LA MADDALENA, SARDINIA, THE AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED </p><p>THAT U.S. PERSONNEL MERIT IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR SUBSTANDARD </p><p>FACILITIES.  ON PRISONER TREATMENT IN AFGHANISTAN, MARTINO </p><p>FAVORS HANDING DETAINEES CAPTURED BY ITALIAN UNITS DURING </p><p>JOINT U.S.-ITALY OPERATIONS OVER TO AMERICAN FORCES.  THE GOI </p><p>IS SEEKING U.S. INPUT ON WHAT TO TELL THE RED CROSS AND </p><p>WHETHER IT SHOULD APPROACH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT A </p><p>STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT (SOFA).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FLOW OF FORCES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) THE AMBASSADOR AND POL-MIN COUNSELOR ON FEBRUARY 12 </p><p>DISCUSSED FLOW OF FORCES AND FORCE PROTECTION ISSUES WITH </p><p>MINDEF MARTINO AND MOD DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TRUPIANO.  MARTINO </p><p>OPENED THE MEETING BY SAYING THAT HE WAS PLEASED WITH THE </p><p>APPROVAL THE GOI HAD GIVEN THE PREVIOUS EVENING FOR U.S. RAIL </p><p>TRANSPORT OF MATERIEL THROUGH ITALY REQUESTED BY EUCOM ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 6.  HE HAD DISCUSSED THE ISSUE PERSONALLY WITH PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI, WHO HAD GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT.  THE GOI\'S SUPPORT </p><p>WAS APPRECIATED, THE AMBASSADOR SAID, BUT IT WAS NOW UNLIKELY </p><p>THE SPECIFIC SHIPMENT WOULD BE TRANSITING ITALY BECAUSE OF </p><p>AUSTRIAN OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED TO MARTINO THAT THE USG </p><p>NEEDS CLARITY ON WHAT IT CAN EXPECT WITH REGARD TO TIMELY </p><p>TRANSIT, BASE ACCESS, AND OVERFLIGHT.  "I HAVE TOLD </p><p>WASHINGTON REPEATEDLY THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM," THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR STATED.  MARTINO AFFIRMED THAT THE GOI WILL LIVE </p><p>UP TO ITS PROMISES, ADDING THAT BERLUSCONI HAD TOLD HIM, </p><p>"ITALY WILL ACT AS A GOOD ALLY SHOULD."  HE ACKNOWLEDGED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE GOI HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN EARLY JANUARY </p><p>WHEN IT INFORMED PARLIAMENT OF PLANNED F16 OVERFLIGHTS </p><p>BECAUSE THIS HAD SET THE BAR TOO LOW.  ASKED IF IT WAS </p><p>POSSIBLE TO WALK BACK THE NEED TO INFORM PARLIAMENT ABOUT </p><p>FLOW OF FORCES DETAILS, MARTINO SAID HE THOUGHT SOMETHING </p><p>COULD BE ACHIEVED.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE NOTED, WE WOULD NOT NEED </p><p>TO TELL THE PARLIAMENT IMMEDIATELY ABOUT DETAILING A LIAISON </p><p>OFFICER TO TAMPA FOR IRAQ-RELATED OPERATIONS (REF A).  THE </p><p>MINDEF WAS TOLD THAT THE TIMING ISSUE WILL BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS OUR REQUESTS ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE </p><p>RAPID AND FREQUENT OVER THE COMING WEEKS.  MARTINO SAID HE </p><p>WAS "TRANQUIL" BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER IS COMMITTED TO </p><p>MEETING ITALY\'S RESPONSIBILITIES.  (NOTE: THIS MEETING </p><p>OCCURRED BEFORE RECEIPT OF REF B, WHICH WILL SERVE AS A </p><p>SPECIFIC MEASURE OF MARTINO\'S GENERAL COMMITMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>FORCE PROTECTION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) MARTINO AFFIRMED THAT ITALY IS PREPARED TO HELP THE </p><p>U.S. FULLY MEET ITS FORCE PROTECTION NEEDS.  HE WILL INFORM </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR IN WRITING </p><p>ABOUT ITALY\'S FP RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE U.S.  POL-MIN </p><p>COUNSELOR EXPLAINED THAT WHILE OUR REQUEST FOR A FORCE </p><p>PROTECTION PLUS UP AT SIGONELLA WOULD NOT BE PARTICULARLY </p><p>VISIBLE, REQUIREMENTS AT AUGUSTA BAY ARE OF A DIFFERENT </p><p>ORDER.  THERE, WE ARE LOOKING FOR AROUND-THE-CLOCK PROTECTION </p><p>OF LARGE SHIPS NEEDED TO DEFEND THE SUEZ CANAL AND KEEP </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SEA LANES OPEN BY SMALLER, PREFERABLY U.S., </p><p> </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    FAAE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------35D4B7  131904Z /38 </p><p>O 131817Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8237 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE IMMEDIATE </p><p>COMUSNAVEUR LONDON UK IMMEDIATE </p><p>HQ EUCOM VAIHINGEN GE IMMEDIATE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p></p></div>
