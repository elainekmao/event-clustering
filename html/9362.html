<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 001321 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, PM AND INR </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PREL, PHUM, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: PEACE PROCESS PROGNOSIS DIM </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 1099 (B) KATHMANDU 1175 (C) </p><p>     KATHMANDU 1262 (D) KATHMANDU 1032 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) Summary.  Maoist activities in violation of the </p><p>code of conduct, including extortion, harassment and </p><p>abductions, have increased since late May, dramatically in </p><p>the last couple of weeks.  In particular, Maoists have </p><p>stepped up efforts to rebuild their war chest with the </p><p>possible objectives of bolstering their stocks of arms and </p><p>ammunition, paying salaries to militants, and/or buying </p><p>political respectability.  At the same time, rhetoric by the </p><p>Maoist leadership against the Government of Nepal has grown </p><p>more vitriolic.  Maoist rhetoric against the United States </p><p>increased several weeks ago as well, but appears to have </p><p>tapered off more recently.  A truncated negotiating team, </p><p>limited by Prime Minister Thapa\'s failure to bring the legal </p><p>political parties into the government, has delayed resumption </p><p>of formal peace talks.  Although informal talks began July </p><p>12, formal negotiations are on hold until the two sides </p><p>concur on what was agreed at the last round of talks. </p><p>Statements and actions by other actors, such as the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army, National Police and the Palace, could place </p><p>increasing strain on the cease-fire.  It now appears that the </p><p>Maoists are preparing to abandon the negotiations if they </p><p>cannot obtain a commitment from the GON for an unrealistic </p><p>demand to restrict army movements, and will likely blame the </p><p>Government if they resume violence.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Increase in Maoist Activity </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Since late May, the insurgents have increased sharply </p><p>activities in violation of the code of conduct agreed to by </p><p>the Maoists and the Government of Nepal (GON).  Relaxed </p><p>restrictions during the cease-fire have allowed the Maoists </p><p>to increase their presence in areas where they were less </p><p>active and to continue to intimidate the population in areas </p><p>not under sustained GON control.  In some areas, the Maoists </p><p>continue to prohibit the GON from re-establishing a presence </p><p>and providing services. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Reports of Maoist extortion, harassment, </p><p>abductions, recruitment and training have become more </p><p>frequent (Ref A).  All of the international chambers of </p><p>commerce have received complaints from member companies that </p><p>the Maoists are regularly harassing and extorting money from </p><p>them in unprecedented amounts.  Reports from the countryside </p><p>indicate that the insurgents are taxing harvests, development </p><p>projects, drug trafficking, and remittances, as well as </p><p>forcing villagers to pay for \'membership cards\' into the </p><p>Maoist organization (Refs B, C).  Press reports indicate that </p><p>since the end of May the Maoists have abducted 65 people and </p><p>killed 6 others as compared to 148 abductions and 8 killings </p><p>from January through May.  (Note. GON security forces </p><p>reportedly have killed 6 suspected-Maoists in the period from </p><p>January through May and another 14 people since late May. </p><p>End Note.)   Maoist military training has been ongoing, with </p><p>the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) reporting over 150 known training </p><p>exercises since the cease-fire was declared in January. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) The increase in insurgent activity coincided with </p><p>the May 30 resignation of then-Prime Minister Lokendra </p><p>Chand\'s government and was likely a reaction to political </p><p>uncertainties over the new government leadership.  With </p><p>Chand\'s resignation, the first GON negotiating team was </p><p>dissolved; talks with the Maoists have not resumed since the </p><p>second round was held May 9.  Prime Minister Surya Bahadur </p><p>Thapa has appointed two cabinet members to the negotiating </p><p>team with the intention of including negotiators from the </p><p>main political parties once, and if, they join the </p><p>government.  In the meantime, Information Minister Kamal </p><p>Thapa announced publicly in late June the GON\'s willingness </p><p>to resume negotiations.  Informal meetings began July 12, but </p><p>formal negotiations are on hold until the two sides concur on </p><p>what was agreed at the last round of negotiations. </p><p>Well-placed Embassy contacts indicate that the Thapa </p><p>government is preparing to resume the negotiations in a more </p><p>systematic, professional way than was done by previous GON </p><p>negotiators.  However, most of the Maoist leadership, </p><p>including the negotiating team, has been conspicuously absent </p><p>from the capital since early June, apparently (and </p><p>inexplicably) fearing preemptive arrests by the Government. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- </p><p>Maoist Rhetoric: Accusations against the GON and United States </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Maoist rhetoric has grown increasingly negative </p><p>since the Thapa government came to power on June 4 (Ref B). </p><p>The rhetoric\'s focus has been on accusations that the GON has </p><p>been violating the code of conduct and on warnings against </p><p>"foreign interference," placing particular emphasis on </p><p>alleged interference from the U.S., UK and, to a lesser </p><p>extent, India.  Maoist political leaders continue to press </p><p>for a round table meeting with the King and political </p><p>parties, an interim cabinet that would include Maoist leaders </p><p>and a constituent assembly that would overhaul the </p><p>constitution, with special attention to severing the King\'s </p><p>authority over the army. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) Although Maoist anti-American rhetoric has tapered </p><p>off in the last two weeks, that rhetoric in the recent past </p><p>targeted the Maoists\' formal inclusion on the U.S. </p><p>Government\'s terrorist watch-list as well as U.S. military </p><p>and economic support to the GON.  In a press release on June </p><p>29, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, Maoist supreme </p><p>leader, declared that there was a "serious conspiracy from </p><p>within and outside the country" to derail the peace process. </p><p> Leftist newspapers and surrogate covert Maoist supporters </p><p>have reported that the U.S. is encouraging the GON to take a </p><p>hard-line approach to negotiations with the Maoists, falsely </p><p>suggesting that the U.S. is pushing the GON towards breaking </p><p>the cease-fire. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Maoist Fund-Raising Objectives: Guns or Butter? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>7. (S/NF) The insurgents\' aggressive campaign of fund-raising </p><p>through extortion could have a number of objectives.  First, </p><p>the Maoist leadership could be building up its war chest in </p><p>anticipation of a break in the cease-fire and resumption of </p><p>hostilities.  Post has received information that the Maoists </p><p>continue to seek and import arms and ammunition and have the </p><p>financial wherewithal and capacity to use explosives albeit, </p><p>still at a fairly unsophisticated level.  Second, the RNA </p><p>reports that the Maoist leadership\'s financial needs have </p><p>increased because it has been obliged to begin offering </p><p>salaries comparable to those of the RNA in order to retain </p><p>its mid- and low-level cadres.  The Army leadership tells us </p><p>that its information indicates that the Maoist organization </p><p>is under stress due to low morale, a lack of resources and </p><p>the perception by the rank and file that the leadership is </p><p>faltering.   Third, the Maoist leadership could be building </p><p>up its treasury in order to buy political respectability and </p><p>to assist its effort at a \'soft landing\' within the political </p><p>mainstream.  Another possibility, supported by some </p><p>intelligence, is that the Maoists will pursue both military </p><p>capability and political respectability simultaneously by </p><p>sending its military wing underground while pursuing </p><p>political advantage as a legitimate party. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Splits Within the Maoist Camp? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Maoist organization is structured with a Central </p><p>Committee of roughly 50 members and smaller District </p><p>Committees led by District Commanders.  How the insurgents </p><p>approach recruitment, training and extortion at the district </p><p>level depends largely on the personality of the District </p><p>Commander.  Consequently, in some districts, there have been </p><p>few incidents of abduction or forceful recruitment, while in </p><p>others there have been many.  However, in all districts, even </p><p>those considered less Maoist-affected, local Maoists have </p><p>held mass gatherings and continue to collect money through </p><p>taxes and extortion. </p><p>9. (S/NF) There appears to be some disconnect between the </p><p>district-level Maoist rhetoric and that at the national </p><p>level.  In Chitwan, for example, during their mass meetings, </p><p>local Maoists reportedly have expressed deep commitment to </p><p>the peace process and unwillingness to return to the jungle. </p><p>However, national-level rhetoric continues to be hard-line, </p><p>reasserting that the Maoists are willing and able to resume </p><p>guerrilla warfare.  In late June, the Maoist supreme leader </p><p>Prachanda declared that there would be a "great disaster" if </p><p>the peace negotiations were disrupted.  One worrisome </p><p>consequence of this disconnect is that it is not certain that </p><p>all the district commanders would obey a central order to </p><p>disarm if a political settlement were reached in Kathmandu. </p><p> </p><p>10. (S/NF) There may be some increased strain also within the </p><p>Maoist Central Committee.  The political leadership headed by </p><p>Dr. Baburam Bhattarai reportedly is more interested in </p><p>working with the disaffected political parties and becoming </p><p>part of the political mainstream than the military arm led by </p><p>Ram Bahadur Thapa (alias Badal) and the Maoist supreme </p><p>commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal (alias Prachanda).  However, </p><p>reports from the field indicate that the Maoist military </p><p>cadres, with some exceptions, are continuing to execute </p><p>orders faithfully from the politburo.  Post believes that </p><p>there is a strong possibility that the Maoist leadership </p><p>could stage a falling-out between the political and military </p><p>wings, thereby allowing the political leadership to continue </p><p>its dialogue with the GON while the military wing uses terror </p><p>and violence to reinforce the Maoist position, a la tactics </p><p>used by the IRA/Sein Fein and the Palestinian Liberation </p><p>Organization.  RNA leaders suggest that they are aware of </p><p>this possibility and are prepared to counteract it, but have </p><p>not specified how. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Grim Prognosis for Peace Process </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (S/NF) The dramatic increase in violations of the code of </p><p>conduct by the Maoists, the delay in peace talks, the </p><p>intransigence of the legal parties, increasingly negative </p><p>rhetoric by the Maoists, and possible dissonance within the </p><p>Maoist hierarchy are putting growing pressure on the </p><p>cease-fire.  Some suspect that top Maoists are in hiding </p><p>already for fear that Prime Minister Thapa\'s new government </p><p>intends to break the cease-fire unilaterally and seize the </p><p>Maoist leadership.  The government is coming under increased </p><p>pressure from a growing number of victims of the Maoist </p><p>extortion campaign to put a stop to it.  That likely would </p><p>result in the arrests of some key Maoists including some </p><p>known leaders.  For talks to resume, the Maoists have </p><p>indicated that Thapa\'s government must confirm in advance its </p><p>acceptance of agreements allegedly reached during the second </p><p>negotiating round.  However, because there are no written </p><p>records of those talks, controversy continues, particularly </p><p>over whether the previous GON negotiating team agreed to </p><p>limit the RNA to within 5 kilometers of its barracks. </p><p> </p><p>12. (S/NF) All sides--the Maoists, RNA, National Police and </p><p>Palace--have made statements or are acting in ways that could </p><p>aggravate the fragility of the cease-fire.  RNA leaders have </p><p>warned that they are prepared to implement martial law in the </p><p>far west and east of the country if the cease-fire breaks. </p><p>On July 6, the Inspector General of Police issued an arrest </p><p>warrant on extortion charges for Kumar Dahal (alias Vijay), </p><p>the Maoist commander in the Kathmandu Valley who claimed </p><p>responsibility for the murders of two Embassy security </p><p>personnel in December 2001 and November 2002.  If the arrest </p><p>takes place, the Maoists might use it as an excuse to break </p><p>the cease-fire, claiming a direct attack on the party </p><p>leadership.  Meanwhile, King Gyanendra appears willing to </p><p>take a more assertive role.  In a private conversation with </p><p>the Ambassador, the King suggested that if Prime Minister </p><p>Thapa is unable to win the cooperation of the political </p><p>parties, he could be forced to consider a range of possible </p><p>options."  The only prognosis on which there is much </p><p>agreement among our best contacts is that the future of peace </p><p>negotiations looks increasingly grim. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
