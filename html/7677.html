END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Latest Tiger Statement </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Late April 25, London-based chief Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham issued a direct response to the U.S. </p><p>statement re the group\'s April 21 pullout from the peace </p><p>talks.  (Note:  See Ref B for the text of the U.S. </p><p>statement issued on April 24, which took the form of </p><p>Ambassador Wills\' response to a series of questions.) </p><p>Balasingham\'s remarks, which are contained in Para 8, </p><p>were in question-and-answer format (like the U.S. </p><p>statement).  Balasingham made the following key points </p><p>in his remarks: </p><p> </p><p>-- Support for Negotiated Settlement:  The first part of </p><p>the statement goes out of its way to underline that the </p><p>LTTE has not terminated the negotiating process.  On </p><p>this point, Balasingham states:  "We have not scuttled </p><p>the peace process...We have no intention of running away </p><p>from the negotiating process."  The statement stresses </p><p>that the Tigers want to see progress on several issues </p><p>by the GSL, including regarding the delivery of </p><p>humanitarian assistance and the reduction in size of the </p><p>Jaffna security zones.  In light of these outstanding </p><p>issues, Balasingham states that "Our decision to </p><p>temporarily suspend negotiations giving time for the </p><p>government to act is a fair and rationale form of </p><p>protest." </p><p> </p><p>-- Renouncing Terrorism and Violence:  In its second key </p><p>section, the statement asserts that the LTTE has </p><p>"already abdicated all acts of armed violence ever since </p><p>we signed the ceasefire agreement."  Re disarmament, </p><p>Balasingham indicates that this can only be considered </p><p>at a later stage in the peace process, stating "The </p><p>ethnic conflict is not yet resolved and the threat of </p><p>Sinhala military aggression of Tamil lands is not yet </p><p>over.  Under these circumstances, decommissioning or </p><p>abdication of arms is non-negotiable."  The statement </p><p>goes on to note that even under the terms of a </p><p>negotiated settlement Tamils might "need a security </p><p>system that would permanently ensure the protection" of </p><p>their rights. </p><p> </p><p>-- Nature of Economic Problems:  Balasingham admits that </p><p>past LTTE attacks "had disastrous effects on the </p><p>island\'s economy."  That said, Balasingham goes on to </p><p>assert -- as he did in his April 21 statement regarding </p><p>the LTTE\'s pullout from the talks -- that actions (bad </p><p>economic planning, corruption, etc.) by "successive" Sri </p><p>Lankan governments are the root cause of poverty in the </p><p>south, not the war.  Thus, he continues, the focus of </p><p>international assistance efforts should be on the war- </p><p>torn north and east, and not the south. </p><p> </p><p>-- General Economic/Political Stance:  Balasingham makes </p><p>clear that the Tigers support an "open market economy </p><p>based on liberal democratic values."  Continuing, he </p><p>notes that further details on Tiger economic/fiscal </p><p>policies "would have to be worked out...in the final </p><p>framework of a system of federal government at a later </p><p>stage." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Reaction to LTTE Statement </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Reaction to the LTTE statement has been quite </p><p>positive.  The Ambassador\'s April 26 meeting with </p><p>Minister G.L. Peiris, the government\'s chief negotiator, </p><p>illustrates this.  Peiris began the meeting by </p><p>expressing deep distress over the peace process </p><p>(Note:  Peiris\' private concerns were markedly different </p><p>from the upbeat posture he has maintained in public -- </p><p>see Ref B.)  Peiris visibly brightened, however, when he </p><p>received a phone call from visiting Norwegian envoy (and </p><p>former ambassador to Sri Lanka) Jon Westborg, who </p><p>stressed that he thought that Balasingham\'s comments </p><p>were quite constructive and could indicate a softening </p><p>in the LTTE\'s position re the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Westborg was quite explicit on this point in an </p><p>April 28 meeting with the Ambassador, underlining that </p><p>he thought that Balasingham\'s comments represented a </p><p>sharp shift in tone away from the Tigers\' harsh April 21 </p><p>rhetoric pulling out of the talks.  In explaining the </p><p>change in tone, Westborg commented that the Tigers seem </p><p>to have received strong signals from the international </p><p>community, especially via the U.S. statement on </p><p>April 24, that it should not go too far.  (Note:  FYI. </p><p>Westborg and newly arrived Norwegian Ambassador Hans </p><p>Brattskar plan to travel to the LTTE-controlled Wanni </p><p>region on April 30 to meet Tiger political chief S.P. </p><p>Thamilchelvam.  The key topics on the agenda will be </p><p>ways to get the talks re-started and the Tokyo </p><p>conference slated to take place in June, which the LTTE </p><p>has said it will not attend.  The Norwegians plan to </p><p>press the LTTE to change its mind and confirm its </p><p>participation in Tokyo as soon as possible, so that </p><p>planning for the meeting can go forward.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Other local reaction has been equally positive. </p><p>Nanda Godage, an official at the GSL Peace Secretariat </p><p>and former ambassador, told polchief April 27 that he </p><p>thought the U.S. statement had "definitely prodded the </p><p>LTTE to proceed in a more conciliatory manner."  Godage </p><p>said he hoped that the LTTE\' April 25 statement presaged </p><p>a positive response to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe\'s </p><p>formal response to the LTTE\'s pullout from the talks, </p><p>which was scheduled to go out some time this week.  In </p><p>addition, poloffs were told by G. Ponnambalam, a Tamil </p><p>National Alliance MP, that he thought that the LTTE\'s </p><p>latest statement indicated that the group was still </p><p>strongly committed to the peace process.  All the Tigers </p><p>wanted, he asserted, was for positive changes on the </p><p>ground, especially the reduction in the size of the </p><p>military\'s security zones in Jaffna.  The group </p><p>definitely did not want a return to armed struggle, he </p><p>concluded.  (Note:  Septel contains additional media </p><p>reaction to the April 24 U.S. statement.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) We agree with observers that the LTTE\'s reaction </p><p>to our statement was constructive.  As noted above, </p><p>Balasingham\'s tone seemed much more moderate and less </p><p>sharp than it had been in his April 21 letter to the </p><p>prime minister suspending the talks.  Moreover, the fact </p><p>that the LTTE emphasized its continued support for a </p><p>negotiated settlement was good news.  It was also </p><p>positive that the group said it supported an "open </p><p>market economy based on liberal democratic values."  As </p><p>far as we are aware, this is the first time the group </p><p>has said that.  On the negative side of the ledger, </p><p>Balasingham took a hard-line stance re disarmament, </p><p>indicating that any discussion of this key subject would </p><p>be kicked down far, far down the road.  Even in light of </p><p>the apparent change of tone by Balasingham, our guess is </p><p>that the Norwegians and the GSL have a fair amount of </p><p>work to do to get the peace process back on track. </p><p>Their efforts won\'t be easy --  the Tigers seem to be </p><p>driving a hard bargain, almost as if they figure the </p><p>government has no choice but to meet their demands </p><p>eventually.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Suggested Press Guidance </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Suggested "if asked" press guidance follows: </p><p> </p><p>Question: </p><p> </p><p>What is the U.S. reaction to the April 25 remarks by </p><p>Tiger negotiator Balasingham? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>We read the remarks by Mr. Balasingham with great </p><p>interest.  We continue to urge the Tigers to return to </p><p>the peace talks and to confirm their participation in </p><p>the Tokyo donors conference scheduled to take place in </p><p>June as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Text of April 25 LTTE Statement </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) As carried by the pro-LTTE website TamilNet, the </p><p>text of the LTTE\'s April 25 statement by Anton </p><p>Balasingham follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>April 25 </p><p> </p><p>>> TamilNet:  Mr. Ashley Wills, the US Ambassador to Sri </p><p>Lanka, in a comprehensive interview with Reuters, ahs </p><p>presented a critical review of the LTTE\'s position as </p><p>set out in your letter to the Prime Minister Mr. Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe.  What, in your view, is the central </p><p>thrust of this argument?  Do you agree with him? </p><p> </p><p>>> Mr. Balasingham:  Mr. Wills\' central contention is </p><p>that the LTTE should continue to engage the Government </p><p>of Sri Lanka to address grievances rather than walking </p><p>away from talks.  There is an element of </p><p>misunderstanding here with regard to our position.  We </p><p>have not terminated the negotiating process or walked </p><p>away from talks.  What we have decided is to temporarily </p><p>suspend the talks to provide time and space for the </p><p>government to implement crucial decisions, particularly </p><p>the normalization aspects of the Ceasefire Agreement. </p><p>We have not scuttled the peace process or terminated </p><p>negotiations.  We intentionally created an interval, an </p><p>interregnum for the government to take immediate and </p><p>constructive measures to address urgent humanitarian </p><p>issues faced by the Tamils.  We have taken the talks </p><p>very seriously and the implementation of the decisions </p><p>at the talks more seriously.  Our intention is to </p><p>pressurize the government to realize the urgency of the </p><p>existential issues confronting our people and to impress </p><p>upon them the importance of fulfilling obligations, </p><p>pledges and decisions.  The internally displaced and the </p><p>refugees have been languishing in refugee camps and </p><p>welfare centres for more than ten years.  Obligations </p><p>under Ceasefire Agreement have not been fulfilled for </p><p>nearly fifteen months.  Our pleas for the last six </p><p>months during sessions of talks, to resolve the issue of </p><p>resettlement have not been taken seriously.  I don\'t </p><p>think Mr. Wills has understood the frustrations and the </p><p>enormous suffering of the uprooted Tamils.  The </p><p>Ceasefire Agreement is a serious commitment by the </p><p>parties in conflict, not only to cease armed </p><p>confrontations but to create conditions to restore </p><p>normal life to the Tamil civilian population also.  The </p><p>Sri Lankan armed forces have yet to fulfil their </p><p>obligations under the truce and continue to violate the </p><p>fundamental rights of the refugees to return to their </p><p>homes and villages.  This is the problem in a nutshell. </p><p>We are representing the interest of our people.  As the </p><p>representatives of our people we reserve the right to </p><p>express our displeasure if decisions at the talks are </p><p>not implemented and bilateral agreements are not </p><p>fulfilled.  Our decision to temporarily suspend </p><p>negotiations giving time for the government to act is a </p><p>fair and rational form of protest.  We wish to assure </p><p>Mr. Wills that we have no intention of running away from </p><p>the negotiating process or `pulling out of the talks\' as </p><p>he puts it.  We have reiterated our commitment to seek a </p><p>negotiated settlement in our letter addressed to Mr. </p><p>Wickramasinghe. </p><p> </p><p>>> TamilNet:  Mr. Ashley Wills has reiterated the usual </p><p>American position that the LTTE should renounce </p><p>`terrorism and violence\' to be accepted and respected by </p><p>the international community.  He further says that the </p><p>possession of weapons and the maintenance of armed </p><p>formations by the LTTE are not going to protect Tamil </p><p>rights but rather will prolong the conflict.  What is </p><p>your comment on this position? </p><p> </p><p>>> Mr. Balasingham:  Mr. Wills as well as Mr. Armitage </p><p>have always advocated the renunciation of `terrorism and </p><p>violence\' by the LTTE.  The Americans are well aware </p><p>that our organization has already abdicated all aspects </p><p>of armed violence ever since we signed a Ceasefire </p><p>Agreement.  Yet we do have military formations to </p><p>protect our lands and our people.  The ethnic conflict </p><p>is not yet resolved and the threat of Sinhala military </p><p>aggression of Tamil lands is not yet over.  Under these </p><p>circumstances, decommissioning or abdication of arms is </p><p>non-negotiable.  The majority of the Tamil people will </p><p>not agree with Mr. Wills\' perception that the </p><p>maintenance of armed formations by the LTTE would not </p><p>protect the Tamil rights but rather create conflicts. </p><p>On this issue the Tamils seriously differ with Mr. </p><p>Wills.  Our people have suffered bitter historical </p><p>experience of state terror and oppression extending over </p><p>decades.  The Tamils resorted to armed resistance as the </p><p>last resort to defend their right to existence.  Having </p><p>gone through turbulent periods of state repression and </p><p>armed resistance, of failed negotiations and betrayals, </p><p>the Tamil people have genuine fears and anxieties with </p><p>regards to their safe and secure existence.  The Tamils </p><p>are seeking, not only substantial political autonomy but </p><p>also a security system that would permanently ensure the </p><p>protection of their right to live peacefully with </p><p>dignity and freedom in their historically given </p><p>homeland.  I sincerely hope that the Americans will </p><p>appreciate and understand the aspirations as well as </p><p>apprehensions of a people who have faced genocidal </p><p>oppression from State terrorism and violence. </p><p> </p><p>>> TamilNet:  Mr. Wills argues that your theme that the </p><p>economic deprivation of the south and the devastation of </p><p>the northeast could not be blamed entirely on Colombo\'s </p><p>misguided policies.  He says that the LTTE\'s violent </p><p>`separatist agenda\' was also a contributory factor for </p><p>the impoverished conditions of the south.  What do you </p><p>say? </p><p> </p><p>>> Mr. Balasingham:  Mr. Wills agrees that successive </p><p>Sri Lankan governments have made blunders.  I stand by </p><p>my view that the economic chaos of Sri Lanka is self- </p><p>inflicted in the sense that disastrous militaristic </p><p>policies based on heavy international borrowing coupled </p><p>with bad governance, bureaucratic inefficiency and </p><p>widespread corruption were the contributing factors for </p><p>the collapse of the economic system.  I do not deny the </p><p>fact that the LTTE\'s defensive war campaigns that </p><p>included strikes at the state\'s economic targets had </p><p>disastrous effects on the island\'s economy.  The LTTE\'s </p><p>armed struggle can only be characterized as reactive </p><p>violence against state violence, a form of resistance </p><p>against intolerable repression.  Mr. Wills, who should </p><p>be familiar with the evolutionary history of the armed </p><p>resistance movement of the Tamils knows very well that </p><p>successive Sri Lankan governments, until the assumption </p><p>of the present regime, adopted rigid militaristic </p><p>policies that intensified the conditions of war which </p><p>brought colossal destruction of the Tamil nation and led </p><p>to the economic collapse of the Sinhala nation.  Apart </p><p>from the causal problems of the conflict Mr. Wills will </p><p>certainly agree that poverty and deprivation prevailing </p><p>in the northeast are far worse than that of the south. </p><p> </p><p>>> TamilNet:  Mr. Ashley Wills suggests that the LTTE is </p><p>expecting to much too soon by way of a peace divided, </p><p>that `Rome wasn\'t built in a day\' as he put it.  How do </p><p>you respond? </p><p> </p><p>>> Mr. Balasingham:  There are two distinct issues here; </p><p>first, the urgent and immediate problems faced by the </p><p>Tamil people and secondly, the long-term economic </p><p>development of the Tamil areas.  The two should not be </p><p>confused.  As I have said, our present concern and </p><p>intention is to pressurize the government to realize the </p><p>urgency of the existential issues confronting our </p><p>people.  Hundreds of thousands of Tamils are being </p><p>prevented from returning to their homes due to ongoing </p><p>military occupation.  The infrastructure of the Tamil </p><p>areas, where the conflict has been raging, has been </p><p>completely destroyed.  We do not accept that the </p><p>resettling of the displaced people and refugees, the </p><p>restoration of normalcy or the rehabilitation efforts </p><p>are matters to be addressed in the course of time.  We </p><p>have been stressing the importance of this from the </p><p>outset of the peace process and are disappointed at the </p><p>government\'s refusal to take this issue seriously. </p><p>However, the long term development of the Tamil areas is </p><p>something separate to be discussed and addressed in the </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p>>> TamilNet:  The American Ambassador is questioning the </p><p>economic ideology of the LTTE.  What is your comment? </p><p> </p><p>>> Mr. Balasingham:  I can only say that we are in favor </p><p>of an open market economy based on liberal democratic </p><p>values.  Specific economic policies and fiscal </p><p>arrangements have to be worked out in more detail in the </p><p>final framework of a system of federal government at a </p><p>later stage. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
