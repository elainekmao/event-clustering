POST WAS CONCERNED BY THE STATEMENT IN REFTEL THAT THE WORLD </p><p>FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) "HAS NO PLANS TO START UP ANY OPERATIONS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE."  HOWEVER, WE SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED FROM UNDP RESIDENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE VICTOR ANGELO ON AUGUST 23 THAT WFP PLANS TO ASSIGN </p><p>TEMPORARILY TWO PROGRAM OFFICERS TO ZIMBABWE FOR A TWO-MONTH </p><p>PERIOD, BEGINNING IMMEDIATELY.  THE TWO-PERSON TEAM APPARENTLY </p><p>WILL CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EXPECTED FOOD SHORTAGE AND DO </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING.  (NB. OTHER THAN A PROCUREMENT OFFICIAL, </p><p>THERE IS NO WFP FOOD EXPERT RESIDENT IN ZIMBABWE.)  WFP HAS A </p><p>CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY IN COORDINATING THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE; </p><p>WITHOUT ENERGETIC COORDINATION FROM WFP, WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE A </p><p>MOSAIC OF BILATERAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY </p><p>SHOULD BE IN MEETING THE HUMANITARIAN NEED.  WE ARE PLEASED, </p><p>THEREFORE, TO SEE THAT WFP APPEARS TO BE STEPPING UP ITS </p><p>INVOLVEMENT, BUT WASHINGTON WILL NEED TO REMAIN IN CLOSE CONTACT </p><p>WITH WFP ON THE URGENCY OF THE FOOD CRISIS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>COORDINATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON A RELATED NOTE, ANGELO TOLD US THAT THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO </p><p>BE CHANGING ITS TUNE A BIT ON THE ISSUE OF THE IMPENDING FOOD </p><p>SHORTAGE.  UNTIL RECENTLY, OF COURSE, THE GOZ DENIED THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF A SHORTFALL.  EARLIER THIS WEEK, HOWEVER, A SENIOR </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGED TO ANGELO THAT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE WOULD BE REQUIRED AND </p><p>INDICATED THAT HE WOULD TRY TO BE HELPFUL IN SECURING GOZ </p><p>COOPERATION ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02514  241110Z </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
