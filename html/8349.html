(SBU) Summary - Health Canada has once again deferred </p><p>making a final decision on General Mill\'s August 2001 </p><p>application for temporary marketing authority to sell </p><p>breakfast cereals with U.S. vitamin fortification levels in </p><p>Canada.  After their own analysis indicated that high levels </p><p>of folic acid could mask a B-12 vitamin deficiency in </p><p>children, Health Canada decided to wait for the results of an </p><p>Institute of Medicine Study on the tolerable upper levels of </p><p>nutrient intake before making a final judgment on General </p><p>Mill\'s application.  This will delay a decision on General </p><p>Mill\'s submission until fall 2003, at the earliest.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Due to regulatory differences, American manufacturers </p><p>must currently do separate production runs for the Canadian </p><p>and U.S. markets in order to comply with different limits of </p><p>vitamin and micro-nutrient fortification in each country. </p><p>Both Health Canada and USG agencies are sponsoring a </p><p>long-term study of Dietary Reference Intakes by the U.S. </p><p>Institute of Medicine (IOM).  When all phases of the study </p><p>are completed in 2004, it will provide a common baseline for </p><p>each country to review nutrient levels and harmonize </p><p>nutritional standards.  The IOM study is one element of an </p><p>ongoing GOC review of Canada\'s food fortification policy. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In August 2001, General Mills applied to Health </p><p>Canada for a Temporary Marketing Authorization Letter (TMAL) </p><p>to allow sales of their 19-product range of breakfast cereals </p><p>in Canada at U.S. fortification levels.  The TMAL would </p><p>provide General Mills with immediate, but short-term </p><p>regulatory relief to sell cereals fortified at U.S. levels </p><p>while the IOM study and Canada\'s fortification policy are </p><p>completed.  TMALs are used to permit temporary marketing </p><p>authorization when the benefits of a product are clear but </p><p>the potential risks are still under study.  TMALs have been </p><p>granted by Health Canada for numerous products including </p><p>calcium-enhanced orange juice and Omega-3 eggs.  General </p><p>Mills provided all the information requested by Health </p><p>Canada, and even voluntarily changed fortification levels on </p><p>zinc to Canadian standards.  Well into the review process </p><p>Health Canada raised additional concerns about the levels of </p><p>folic acid and requested further studies.  General Mills </p><p>supplied additional data on folic acid in February 2003.  As </p><p>of mid-May, General Mills had heard nothing from Health </p><p>Canada and asked the Embassy to intervene, which we did. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On May 28, Health Canada Deputy Minister Ian Green </p><p>informed the DCM and General Mills representatives of the </p><p>results of their analysis of General Mill\'s data on folic </p><p>acid.  The Health Canada panel which reviewed the data is </p><p>concerned that the levels of folic acid permitted under U.S </p><p>regulations could mask a vitamin B-12 deficiency in children. </p><p> Green noted that studies on the upper levels of intake from </p><p>other countries, including one from the United Kingdom, have </p><p>raised similar concerns.  Health Canada has decided to put </p><p>off a final decision on General Mill\'s TMAL until after the </p><p>publication of an IOM study on the upper reference levels of </p><p>nutrients, which is due to be completed by September 30, </p><p>2003.  This study is part of the larger IOM review of dietary </p><p>reference intakes.  Green promised to provide General Mills </p><p>and the Embassy with a copy of the panel\'s report. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment - We have been extremely frustrated by </p><p>Health Canada\'s lack of transparency throughout the TMAL </p><p>review process.  Our numerous efforts to seek clarification </p><p>from Health Canada on both the process and timing of their </p><p>review have been regularly ignored or belatedly answered with </p><p>bureaucratic doublespeak.  General Mills has complained that </p><p>Health Canada has repeatedly raised the bar as to what is </p><p>required for approval of the TMAL.  The current delay pending </p><p>final results of the IOM study would appear to run counter to </p><p>both the letter and spirit of the TMAL process. In our </p><p>conversation with Green we stressed the importance of </p><p>ensuring that Health Canada takes a final decision on the </p><p>TMAL shortly after the release of the IOM report. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
