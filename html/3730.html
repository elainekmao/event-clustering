END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>(2)  (SBU)  IN LATE JULY, LOCAL AND SPECIAL "ECONOMIC POLICE" IN </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY SEIZED 23 TRUCKLOADS OF MATERIAL USED TO MAKE </p><p>COUNTERFEIT NIKE AND ADIDAS SHOES.  IN GATHERING THE EVIDENCE FOR </p><p>THE RAID, THE POLICE WORKED CLOSELY WITH NIKE\'S NEW IN-HOUSE </p><p>INVESTIGATOR, WHO SPENT ONE YEAR GATHERING EVIDENCE FROM </p><p>INFORMANTS AND OLD-FASHIONED DETECTIVE WORK.  IRONICALLY, NIKE </p><p>INITIATED THE INVESTIGATION AFTER RECEIVING A TIP-OFF FROM A </p><p>COMPETING COUNTERFEIT PRODUCER. </p><p> </p><p>(3)  (SBU)  THE MATERIALS SEIZED IN THE RAID WERE EITHER </p><p>COUNTERFEIT PARTS, MOSTLY MANUFACTURED IN VIETNAM, OR DEFECTIVE </p><p>NIKE AND ADIDAS SHOE PARTS SLATED FOR RECYCLING.  COUNTERFEITERS </p><p>BOUGHT THE DEFECTIVE PARTS FROM RECYCLERS, SCAVENGERS OR FROM NIKE </p><p>WORKERS WHO SMUGGLE SHOE PARTS OUT OF THE FACTORY IN THEIR CLOTHES </p><p>OR LITERALLY FLING THEM OVER THE BACK FENCES.  THE NIKE COUNTRY </p><p>MANAGER ESTIMATES THAT THE OPERATION HAD MADE 5000 PAIRS OF SHOES </p><p>SINCE JANUARY 2001, WHICH WERE SOLD ALL OVER VIETNAM FOR A PROFIT </p><p>OF VND 800 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY USD 52,000).  THE RAW MATERIALS </p><p>ALONE WERE WORTH OVER VND 300,000,000 (USD 20,000) AND COULD BE </p><p>MANUFACTURED INTO 15,000 SHOES.  SOLD AT AN AVERAGE USD 7.25 PER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00934  161034Z </p><p>PAIR, THE COUNTERFEITERS COULD HAVE MADE AN ADDITIONAL USD </p><p>112,300.  THE AVERAGE PER CAPITA INCOME IN VIETNAM IS ABOUT USD </p><p>450. </p><p> </p><p>(4)  (SBU)  NIKE PRAISED THE COOPERATION IT RECEIVED FROM THE </p><p>LOCAL POLICE, EVEN THOUGH NIKE PAID FOR THE POLICE OVERTIME AND </p><p>MATERIALS (E.G., FUEL) TO MOUNT THE RAID, TRUCKS TO HAUL AWAY THE </p><p>MATERIAL, AND THE STORAGE COSTS AT A WAREHOUSE PENDING ACTUAL </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF THE MATERIALS.  THE POLICE RESPONDED QUICKLY (ONE </p><p>WEEK) TO NIKE\'S REQUEST FOR AN INVESTIGATION, AND WORKED </p><p>EXPEDITIOUSLY (SIX MONTHS) TO COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION. </p><p>IRONICALLY, NIKE SUSPECTS THAT THE RAID WAS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE AN </p><p>INFORMANT INSIDE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD TIPPED OFF THE </p><p>COUNTERFEITER SO FREQUENTLY, THAT THE COUNTERFEITER ASSUMED THE </p><p>RAID TIP OFF WAS A FALSE ALARM AND FAILED TO VACATE THE PREMISES. </p><p> </p><p>(5)  (SBU)  ALTHOUGH POLICE HELD APPROXIMATELY TWO DOZEN </p><p>COUNTERFEITERS FOR SEVERAL HOURS, NO ARRESTS WERE MADE SINCE THE </p><p>CASE IS NOT YET CONSIDERED CRIMINAL.  NO FINES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED </p><p>EITHER, ALTHOUGH THE ECONOMIC POLICE SHOULD DETERMINE THE FINE </p><p>SHORTLY.  AUTHORITIES ARE STILL CONSIDERING WHETHER TO FILE </p><p>CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST THE COUNTERFEITERS.  (NOTE:  ONE OF THE </p><p>COUNTERFEITERS IS THE NEPHEW OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY CHAIRMAN OF A </p><p>POWERFUL NEIGHBORING PROVINCE.  END NOTE.)  CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE </p><p>POSSIBLE WHEN THE COUNTERFEIT MATERIAL IS WORTH OVER VND 30 </p><p>MILLION (USD 2000).  NIKE CONSIDERS THE SEIZURE OF THE MATERIALS </p><p>AND POSSIBLE PAYMENT OF BACK TAXES TO BE A VICTORY IN ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>(6)  (SBU)  COMMENT:  NIKE\'S NEW PROACTIVE STANCE -- HIRING AN </p><p>INVESTIGATOR AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE POLICE -- MAY SIGNAL A </p><p>NEW PHASE OF TRADEMARK ENFORCEMENT IN VIETNAM.  NIKE\'S STATUS AS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00934  161034Z </p><p>AN INDIRECT EMPLOYER OF ALMOST 60,000 WORKERS IN VIETNAM MAY HAVE </p><p>MOTIVATED THE ENTHUSIASTIC GVN RESPONSE TO NIKE\'S CONCERNS. </p><p>CRITICAL NOW IS THE PENALTY PHASE, AND WHETHER THE COUNTERFEITERS </p><p>RECEIVE A SLAP ON THE HAND OR A REAL CRIMINAL SENTENCE.  WHATEVER </p><p>THE OUTCOME, NIKE\'S PUBLIC PRAISE OF THE POLICE AND ITS PROMISE TO </p><p>INITIATE MORE RAIDS MAY MAKE FOR MORE INTERESTING ACTION IN THE </p><p>MONTHS TO COME.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
