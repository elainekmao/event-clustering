(SBU) AES Honduras\' efforts to salvage its 200MW energy </p><p>contract, awarded and signed Christmas day, 2002 (ref g) </p><p>despite having overcome an unfair government procurement </p><p>process and political influence, may be reaching the end of </p><p>the road this month.  Apparently, due to financial and </p><p>management restructuring, the company leadership have </p><p>directed staff to cease any spending on the El Faro project </p><p>in Honduras and instead find partners willing and able to </p><p>meet conditions of the contract.  Although a U.S. oil and </p><p>gas company with substantial interest in the Central </p><p>American region is currently studying potential partnership </p><p>in the LNG-powered project, any final decisions are months </p><p>away.  Closing of an interim deal and payment of the </p><p>required performance bond by a potential local partner, the </p><p>Larach Group, has been delayed by Larach\'s concerns over the </p><p>liability of committing to a project of this size.  On July </p><p>3, AES requested authorization for a contingency plan that </p><p>allows the project to be scaled down and use bunker fuel if </p><p>financing for the LNG plant is not forthcoming in the next </p><p>six months.  On July 9, the GOH refused to grant this </p><p>authorization.  The GOH is threatening to cancel the </p><p>contract and begin legal proceedings by mid July if AES does </p><p>not pay the five million dollar performance bond.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>AES\' Battle to Build Project and Win Contract </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) For more than three years, AES has sought to build </p><p>a regional 540 MW gas-turbine electric power project fueled </p><p>with liquefied natural gas in Puerto Cortes.  The El Faro </p><p>project was designed to provide power not only to Honduras </p><p>but also El Salvador and other Central American countries. </p><p>Throughout the process, AES requested and received extensive </p><p>advocacy from the Embassy and US agencies in Washington. </p><p>Post has treated this advocacy case as a priority because of </p><p>the U.S. commercial interest, the important contribution of </p><p>the project to lowering electricity costs in Honduras, and </p><p>the potential for spurring investment and regional </p><p>integration.  The Embassy has been in constant contact with </p><p>decision-makers in the Honduran government at the highest </p><p>level.  A contract to supply 200 MW of electricity by 2006, </p><p>using natural gas, to the Honduran electric power utility </p><p>ENEE was finally awarded in late 2002 and ratified in </p><p>February. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) To win this contract, AES had to overcome several </p><p>obstacles including political influence stalling the </p><p>processing of the project\'s environmental permit, several </p><p>modifications to the bid specifications favoring local </p><p>companies, six delays in the bid opening date (from January </p><p>until July, 2002) and indications of an unfair evaluation </p><p>process after the bid opening.  The "winning" local company, </p><p>Lufussa was not disqualified despite the incompleteness in </p><p>its offer related to transmission capacity.  The Ambassador </p><p>and Embassy staff supported the company in insisting that </p><p>the government acknowledge the flaws in the award process. </p><p>This advocacy contributed to the government\'s eventual </p><p>decision in early December 2002 to invalidate the tender and </p><p>subsequently provide awards to both Lufussa (210 MW contract </p><p>deliverable within two years) and AES (200 MW contract </p><p>deliverable within four years) (Ref f, g).  Once the </p><p>decision was made, the GOH rushed AES Honduras into a take- </p><p>it-or-leave-it deal, insisting that the contract presented </p><p>on December 24 be signed by December 27, without changes or </p><p>time to send it in for corporate review, which AES Honduras </p><p>President Carlos Pineda did.   Subsequently, the AES </p><p>contract became a political football in the Honduran </p><p>Congress, but eventually was approved, signed by the </p><p>President in February and published in March. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In the meantime, AES Corporation in the US was </p><p>undergoing financial and management restructuring.  A </p><p>December settlement with creditors did not include any </p><p>capital financing for the Honduras project.  Gas prices </p><p>spiked in the run-up to the war in Iraq and have stayed </p><p>relatively high since, complicating financing arrangements. </p><p>AES\' newly appointed chief of the Central American region </p><p>visited Honduras to explore the possibilities of switching </p><p>to a coal-fired plant.  He concluded it was unfeasible both </p><p>legally and politically (especially since the company had </p><p>spent three years pushing the benefits of bringing gas to </p><p>Central America).  The company then directed the manager of </p><p>AES Honduras to find partners to assume the development </p><p>costs of the project.  AES has emphasized in conversations </p><p>with Econoffs that the company had lost confidence in </p><p>Honduras and its investment climate. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>AES Strategy for Next Steps </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Thus, since February, AES Honduras has sought to </p><p>find both a local partner and an international energy </p><p>company to buy into the project.  These deals have not </p><p>closed as quickly as hoped, and the company appears to be </p><p>running out of time. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) One US oil and gas company, active in Central </p><p>America, is seriously studying a major investment (with </p><p>majority control) in the El Faro project, and has begun its </p><p>own internal studies of the project.  The company would </p><p>bring to the table sufficient funding for the project </p><p>(avoiding the need for a financing package) and its own gas </p><p>reserves.  Investment by this multinational, or one like it, </p><p>would allow the El Faro project to proceed in its original </p><p>form using LNG and meeting all specifications of the </p><p>original emergency contract.  A final decision will not be </p><p>forthcoming, however, until at least November 2003. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) To meet the immediate needs of providing a </p><p>performance bond and final paperwork for an operating </p><p>permit, AES is negotiating to sell a large majority of its </p><p>shares now (up to 90 percent) to the Honduran Larach Group. </p><p>Larach has been interested in participation in El Faro for </p><p>quite some time, but realization of the difficult financing </p><p>prospects for the LNG terminal has delayed the completion of </p><p>the deal.  Recent news of high gas prices and a violent </p><p>kidnapping attempt in June of Luis Larach, one of the </p><p>principal negotiators, also affected the timing. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) To square the circle, on July 3, AES proposed to </p><p>ENEE and the GOH that the government agree that the </p><p>investors would have the flexibility to build a thermal </p><p>plant based on bunker fuel, if financing for the entire LNG </p><p>project could not be found in the next six months.  The </p><p>proposal would give the comfort level to the Larach group to </p><p>sign its deal with AES and put down the five million dollar </p><p>performance bond immediately. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>GOH Reactions </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Since March, President Ricardo Maduro, Minister of </p><p>the Presidency Luis Cosenza and a number of presidential </p><p>advisors have approached the Ambassador and other Emboffs </p><p>with strong concerns about the delays in payment of the </p><p>performance bond and news that AES was not planning on </p><p>maintaining a significant interest in the project.  The GOH </p><p>perceives, probably correctly, a big political risk that </p><p>AES\' exit strategy will be seized upon by political </p><p>opponents who have criticized Maduro for months for bowing </p><p>to pressure (read interference) from the USG in ultimately </p><p>supporting the AES project.  Note: GOH authorities are deaf </p><p>to any suggestion that they brought these problems on </p><p>themselves by badly mishandling the 2002 tender process, </p><p>forcing an unfinanceable contract down AES\' throats over </p><p>Christmas, or refusing to provide the flexibility that would </p><p>allow the company time to bring in a multinational energy </p><p>partner into the equation.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) By June, the government began sending letters to </p><p>AES insisting on compliance with the contract and laying the </p><p>groundwork for legal proceedings against AES for breach of </p><p>contract.   In early July, AES received some encouragement </p><p>to provide the details of the contingency plan for bunker </p><p>fuel.  However, on July 9, a negative reply was received </p><p>from the General Manager of ENEE. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Upon receipt of the letter, AES requested Embassy </p><p>advocacy with President Maduro and his top advisors to </p><p>reconsider the decision.  Without taking a formal position, </p><p>Econcouns participated in a conference call with AES </p><p>officials in Honduras and the U.S. late on July 9 to explain </p><p>our understanding of the GOH\'s view of the picture and </p><p>Embassy limitations in defending the company\'s decision on </p><p>an exit strategy immediately after contract signature. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Embassy Comment </p><p>--------------- </p><p>12. (SBU) This is not necessarily the end of the project, </p><p>but the July 9 decision bodes badly.  The GOH apparently </p><p>decided that if AES is exiting the project and proposing </p><p>that a conventional thermal project be substituted for the </p><p>gas version, there is no need for the GOH to respect its </p><p>side of the contract, especially with other well connected </p><p>domestic electricity producers willing to pick up the </p><p>contract.  Time will tell over the next few weeks if the </p><p>Larach Group investors can convince the GOH otherwise.  If </p><p>the contract is lost and the GOH does sue AES Honduras, that </p><p>will also complicate (if not doom) the efforts to continue </p><p>attracting a sizable investor for the gas project itself. </p><p>While the Embassy believes the July 3 AES proposal was </p><p>probably the best possible given the exit-strategy decision, </p><p>we do not recommend any formal advocacy for AES at this </p><p>time. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
