<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 LONDON 010405 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, UK </p><p>SUBJECT: UNITED KINGDOM: 1999 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 204472 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE UNITED KINGDOM IS ONE OF THE UNITED STATES\' CLOSEST ALLIES </p><p>AND PARTNERS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IT </p><p>ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTES TO THE WORK OF INTERNATIONAL BODIES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE UN, THE GROUP OF EIGHT (G8), AND THE EUROPEAN UNION </p><p>IN PROMOTING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM.  IN </p><p>DECEMBER, THE BLAIR GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED A NEW, PERMANENT, UK- </p><p>WIDE ANTI-TERRORISM LAW TO REPLACE LAWS WHICH HAD BEEN ADOPTED </p><p>OVER THE YEARS IN RESPONSE TO TERRORISM RELATING TO NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND.  THE LAW INCLUDES MEASURES TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>A)  RESPONSE OF UK JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM: DURING 1999, HMG INVOKED EXISTING COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>LEGISLATION TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST AND/OR PROSECUTED A NUMBER OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p>IN FEBRUARY, 79 INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED UNDER THE PREVENTION OF </p><p>TERRORISM ACT AFTER ILLEGALLY OCCUPYING THE GREEK EMBASSY IN </p><p>LONDON IN PROTEST AT THE ARREST IN ATHENS OF PKK LEADER OCALAN. </p><p>THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CHARGED AND CONVICTED UNDER </p><p>THE HMG\'S PUBLIC ORDER ACT.   IN MARCH, THREE ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS, </p><p>ABU HAMZA, AL SIRRI AND \'FRANK\', WERE ARRESTED UNDER THE </p><p>PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT.  THE POLICE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED </p><p>IN NOVEMBER, AND BAIL CONDITIONS WERE DROPPED.  IN JULY, TWO </p><p>EGYPTIANS, ABDEL ALMAGID BARY AND IBRAHIM HUSSEIN ABDEL HADI </p><p>EIDAROUS, WERE ARRESTED IN RESPONSE TO A U.S. REQUEST FOR THEIR </p><p>EXTRADITION.  THEY REMAIN IN DETENTION PENDING THE COMPLETION OF </p><p>THIS PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>IN DECEMBER, THE SCOTTISH JUDGE IN THE TRIAL OF TWO LIBYANS </p><p>ACCUSED OF THE 1988 LOCKERBIE BOMBING RULED AGAINST DEFENSE </p><p>MOTIONS THAT CONSPIRACY TO MURDER CHARGES AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS </p><p>BE DROPPED.  AS A RESULT, THE ACCUSED WILL BE TRIED FOR MURDER, </p><p>BREACH OF THE UK AVIATION SECURITY ACT, AND CONSPIRACY.  THE </p><p>RULING OPENS THE WAY FOR THE BROADEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE </p><p>TO BE PUT BEFORE THE COURT AS PART OF THE TRIAL, WHICH IS </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR MAY 2000. </p><p> </p><p>B)  UK RECORD OF EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  THE UK IS </p><p>COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE U.S. REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION OF THREE </p><p>OF THE FIFTEEN INDIVIDUALS INDICTED IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF </p><p>NEW YORK ON TERRORISM-RELATED CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1998 </p><p>EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM.  KAHLID AL-FAWWAZ, </p><p>WHO SERVED AS USAMA BIN LADEN\'S DE FACTO SPOKESPERSON IN THE UK, </p><p>IS IN DETENTION PENDING EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS IN RESPONSE TO A </p><p>U.S. REQUEST.  TWO EGYPTIANS, ABEL MOHAMMED ABDUL ALMAGID BARY AND </p><p>IBRAHIM HUSSEIN ABDEL HADI EIDAROUS, ALSO REMAIN IN DETENTION </p><p>PENDING EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS TO THE U.S.  IN ADDITION TO THESE </p><p>CASES, HMG IS COOPERATING WITH A FRENCH REQUEST TO EXTRADITE A </p><p>SUSPECTED GIA MEMBER, ALGERIAN RAMDA. </p><p> </p><p>C)  IMPEDIMENTS TO UK PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS:  IT IS HMG POLICY TO PROSECUTE AND/OR EXTRADITE </p><p>SUSPECTED TERORISTS.  HMG PURSUED THIS POLICY WITHIN THE CONTEXT </p><p>OF THE 1951 UN CONVENTION ON REFUGEES AND THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION </p><p>ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR).  THE 1996 ECHR JUDGEMENT IN THE CASE OF </p><p>THE SIKH TERRORIST CHAHAL ESTABLISHED CRITERIA TO BE MET IN CASES </p><p>OF POSSIBLE DEPORTATION. </p><p> </p><p>THE HOME SECRETARY ANNOUNCED IN PARLIAMENT ON JUNE 23, 1999 THAT A </p><p>TECHNICAL ERROR MADE DURING THE ANNUAL RENEWAL OF THE PROTECTION </p><p>OF TERRORISM ACTION MEANT THAT SECTION 16 OF THE ACT HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>IN FORCE FOR A PERIOD FROM MARCH 1998 TO JUNE 1999.  THIS </p><p>TECHNICAL ERROR RESULTING IN THE INDICTMENT AGAINST SUSPECTED GIA </p><p>MEMBER RECHACHI BEING QUASHED. </p><p> </p><p>D)  UK RESPONSES TO TERRORIST INCIDENTS:  HMG CONSISTENTLY </p><p>CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF TERRORISM.  IT MADE A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS IN </p><p>1999 ON SPECIFIC INTERNATIONAL INCIDENTS INCLUDING THE KIDNAP AND </p><p>MURDER OF BRITISH AND OTHER TOURISTS IN UGANDA IN MARCH 1999, AND </p><p>THE KIDNAP AND MURDER OF BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERS IN </p><p>CHECHNYA IN 1998. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK ACTIVELY SUPPORTS BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL INFORMATION- </p><p>SHARING AND COOPERATION TO COMBAT TERRORISM.  IT PROVIDES </p><p>BILATERAL COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>E) MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE UK IN 1999, </p><p>INCLUDING IN INTERNATIONAL FORA: ON DECEMBER 2, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>INTRODUCED MAJOR NEW COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION.  THE </p><p>LEGISLATION WILL REFORM AND EXTEND LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER </p><p>THE YEARS IN RESPONSE TO TERRORIST THREATS AND INCIDENTS IN </p><p>NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS THE NEW LAW TO BE PASSED </p><p>BY PARLIAMENT AND GIVEN ROYAL ASSENT BY AUGUST 24, 2000, WHEN ONE </p><p>OF THE EXISTING LAWS, THE EMERGENCY PROVISIONS ACT (EPA) WILL </p><p>AUTOMATICALLY BE REPEALED.  PROVISIONS IN THE EPA THAT APPLY </p><p>SPECIFICALLY TO NORTHERN IRELAND WILL BE EXTENDED UNDER THE NEW </p><p>LAW, BUT ONLY FOR A PERIOD LIMITED TO FIVE YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>THE NEW LAW IS MEANT TO BE PERMANENT, COMPREHENSIVE, AND UK-WIDE. </p><p>IT DOES DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>AND DEFINES TERRORISM TO INCLUDE "VIOLENCE, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC, </p><p>MEANT TO INTIMIDATE OR COERCE THE GOVERNMENT OR PUBLIC FOR </p><p>POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, OR IDEOLOGICAL ENDS."  THE LAW WILL EXTEND </p><p>PROSCRIPTIVE POWERS, CURRENTLY APPLIED TO TERRORIST GROUPS IN </p><p>NORTHERN IRELAND, TO A BROADER LIST OF INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS THE LAW TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>CURRENT PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT UK FINANCING OR FINANCIAL </p><p>MECHANISMS BEING USED TO SUPPORT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR </p><p>ACTIVITIES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>THE PRINCIPAL INTERNATIONAL FORA IN WHICH THE UK HAS BEEN ACTIVE </p><p>ON TERRORISM ISSUES IN 1999 HAVE BEEN THE UN, THROUGH THE SIXTH </p><p>COMMITTEE, THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND ALSO </p><p>THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE G8.  THE UK PROVIDED STRONG LEADERSHIP </p><p>ON ANTITERRORISM ISSUES WHILE IT LED THE G8 DURING 1998.  IT </p><p>SUPPORTED THE SEPTEMBER 23 STATEMENT BY THE FIVE PERMANENT MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON COMBATING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IT </p><p>HAS COOPERATED FULLY WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS MEANT TO COMBAT </p><p>TERRORISM.  THESE INCLUDE RESOLUTION 1267 (ON SANCTIONS AGAINST </p><p>THE TALIBAN) AND RESOLUTION 1269 (ON TERRORISM). </p><p> </p><p>THE UK HAS RATIFIED TEN OF THE UN CONVENTIONS ON TERRORISM.  IT </p><p>SIGNED THE ELEVENTH, THE CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF </p><p>TERRORIST BOMBING, IN JANUARY 1998 AND EXPECTS TO RATIFY THAT </p><p>CONVENTION IN 2000, BASED ON THE NEW COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION </p><p>WHICH SHOULD BE PASSED BY MID-YEAR.  THE UK EXPECTS TO SIGN THE </p><p>CONVENTION ON TERRORISM FINANCING AS SOON AS IT IS OPENED IN </p><p>JANUARY AND TO RATIFY AS SOON AFTERWARDS AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>F)  POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, </p><p>TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS:  HMG DOES NOT SUPPORT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS.  IT IS </p><p>COMMITTED TO PREVENTING THE UK BEING USED AS A BASE FOR TERRORISM. </p><p>THE POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE GIVE PRIORITY TO COUNTERING ANY </p><p>POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN THE UK BY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISTS, INCLUDING THE ORGANIZATION AND FUNDING OF TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS ABROAD.  INFORMATION ABOUT TERRORISM OR SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TERRORISM IS FULLY INVESTIGATED.  WHERE THERE IS CAUSE TO BELIEVE </p><p>THAT UK LAWS MAY HAVE BEEN VIOLATED, INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS ARE </p><p>PROSECUTED. </p><p> </p><p>G)  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES </p><p>ON A TERRORISM ISSUE:  THE UK HAS NOT MADE ANY STATEMENTS IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF U.S.-DESIGNATED STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ON </p><p>TERRORISM-RELATED ISSUES.  DURING 1999, HMG RESTORED FORMAL </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THREE COUNTRIES ON THE U.S. LIST OF </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES, IRAN, SUDAN AND LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>H)  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HMG\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN HMG\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM DURING 1999. </p><p>THE UK REMAINS RESOLUTELY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM IN ALL FORMS, </p><p>WHATEVER ITS MOTIVATION.  HAVING USED ITS CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE G8 </p><p>AND PRESIDENCY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN 1998 TO HIGHLIGHT AND </p><p>PROVIDE LEADERSHIP ON TERRORISM ISSUES, THE UK IS NOW ENCOURAGING </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES TO ASSUME A LEADERSHIP ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>I)  U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM INITIATIVES PURSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH </p><p>HMG:  THE UK COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. AT ALL LEVELS ON </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY AND ACTIVITIES, BOTH BILATERALLY AND </p><p>THROUGH INTERNATIONAL FORA.  WHEN TERRORISM ISSUES COME BEFORE THE </p><p>UN OR ARE ADDRESSED BY THE G8, THE UK CLOSELY COORDINATES ITS </p><p>VIEWS WITH THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK AND THE U.S. CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER TO BRING TO </p><p>JUSTICE THE TWO LIBYANS ACCUSED OF BOMBING PAN AM FLIGHT 102 OVER </p><p>LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND IN 1988.  IN AUGUST 1988, THE U.S. AND UK </p><p>INTRODUCED A JOINT INITIATIVE, WHICH WOULD PERMIT THE ACCUSED TO </p><p>BE TRIED BEFORE A SCOTTISH COURT SITUATED IN THE NETHERLANDS.  AS </p><p>A RESULT OF THIS JOINT EFFORT, IN APRIL 1999, THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>LIBYA HANDED OVER THE ACCUSED TO THE UN TO AWAIT TRIAL UNDER TERMS </p><p>OF THE INITIATIVE.  THE TRIAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON MAY </p><p>3, 2000, WILL ALLOW THE ACCUSED TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  HMG AND </p><p>THE SCOTTISH EXECUTIVE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH U.S. OFFICIALS </p><p>FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON ALL </p><p>ASPECTS OF PLANNING, INCLUDING LEGAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, SUPPORT FOR </p><p>VICTIMS\' FAMILIES AND PUBLIC/PRESS RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>J)  COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION </p><p>OF AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR </p><p>INTERESTS:  THE UNITED KINGDOM IS ONE OF THE UNITED STATES\' </p><p>CLOSEST ALLIES AND PARTNERS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM.  THIS PARTNERSHIP IS REFLECTED IN CLOSE COOPERATION IN </p><p>MEASURES TO PREVENT TERRORISM AND IN RESPONSES TO TERRORISTS ACTS. </p><p>THE U.S. AND UK PARTICIPATE IN REGULAR BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS AND </p><p>JOINT ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE UK PROVED TO BE </p><p>INVALUABLE TO THE USG IN ITS INVESTIGATION INTO USAMA BIN LADEN </p><p>AND HIS AL-QAEDA ORGANIZATION.  THE U.S. AND UK CONTINUE TO WORK </p><p>CLOSELY TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT KHALID AL-FAWWAZ, ABDEL MOHAMMED </p><p>ABDUL ALMAGID BARY, AND IBRAHIM EIDAROUS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE </p><p>INDICTED IN THE U.S. ON TERRORISM-RELATED CHARGES, ARE </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY EXTRADITED. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE U.S. IN ITS EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF ABDELBASET ALI MOHMED AL MEGRAHI AND AL </p><p>AMIN KHALIFA FHIMAH, WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE BOMBING OF PAN </p><p>AM FLIGHT 102 OVER LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND IN 1998. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. IN THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION INTO THE KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF U.S. AND BRITISH </p><p>CITIZENS IN YEMEN IN DECEMBER 1998. </p><p> </p><p>K)  COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN PREVENTING ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM: THE U.S. AND THE UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE </p><p>AGENCIES MAINTAIN A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO PREVENT </p><p>ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS AND/OR INTERESTS IN THE </p><p>UK.  THIS COOPERATION EXTENDS TO UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF </p><p>INFORMATION-SHARING.  THE UK HAS ASSISTED THE U.S. IN ITS </p><p>INVESTIGATION INTO TERRORIST ACTS IN SCOTLAND, KENYA, TANZANIA, </p><p>AND YEMEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO ASSIST THE U.S. AND UK IN THEIR </p><p>EFFORTS TO PREVENT FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS </p><p>AND/OR INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>LADER </p><p></p></div>
