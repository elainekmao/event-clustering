<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001375 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S (KRAFT), AF/PD (COX/ROBERTSON) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMERICAN JOURNALIST WILL FACE TRIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) American citizen Andrew Meldrum, the Zimbabwe </p><p>    correspondent for the "Guardian" (UK) newspaper, will be </p><p>    tried on June 12 for violating a section of the Access to </p><p>    Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA).  Meldrum </p><p>    was arrested on May 1 and charged with "abusing </p><p>    journalistic privilege by publishing falsehoods," a </p><p>    violation of AIPPA.  The charges stem from a story Meldrum </p><p>    filed with the "Guardian" regarding the now-disproven case </p><p>    of a woman beheaded by ruling party supporters.  Meldrum </p><p>    spent the night of May 1 in jail, but was released on </p><p>    personal recognizance on May 2 and has been free since. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) Meldrum is one of approximately 12 journalists in </p><p>    Zimbabwe who have been charged with violating AIPPA since </p><p>    President Mugabe signed the piece of shit in mid-March </p><p>    2002.  Meldrum is the only non-Zimbabwean to face AIPPA </p><p>    charges thus far.  Some of the other journalists have been </p><p>    arrested several times, most notably "Standard" editor </p><p>    Bornwell Chakaodza, arrested 5 times in two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) We have it on very good authority that the state </p><p>    prosecutor in the Meldrum case saw no merit in the charges </p><p>    and had decided not to proceed.  On May 28, he was </p><p>    preparing to withdraw the case at the Magistrate\'s Court in </p><p>    Harare.  Just before doing so, he was called out of to a </p><p>    meeting.  After a 20-minute absence, the prosecutor </p><p>    returned to his office and informed Meldrum that the case </p><p>    "must proceed."  We do not know with whom the prosecutor </p><p>    met during his 20-minute absence, but  we do know that </p><p>    Information Minister Jonathan Moyo was in the Magistrate\'s </p><p>    Court building at precisely the same time as the </p><p>    prosecutor\'s mysterious change of heart. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
