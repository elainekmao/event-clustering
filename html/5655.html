<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000289 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR G, OES/IHA, OES/PCI, AF/S, AF/EPS, IO/T </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR ONAP </p><p>USAID FOR AFR/AA/AIDW AND BUREAU FOR GLOBAL HEALTH </p><p>DHHS FOR OFFICE OF GLOBAL HEALTH AFFAIRS </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR BURCKY, IVES, WEISEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KHIV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOZ EXTENDS EMERGENCY ON HIV/AIDS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Government of Zimbabwe declared, in a statutory </p><p>instrument in the January 17 Government Gazette, an emergency </p><p>on HIV/AIDS for a period of five years effective from 1 </p><p>January 2003.  The emergency declaration allows the State or </p><p>persons authorized in writing by the Minister of Justice, </p><p>Legal and Parliamentary Affairs under the Patents Act </p><p>     (a) to make or use any patented drug, including any </p><p>antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of persons </p><p>suffering from HIV/AIDS; </p><p>     (b) to import generic drugs used in the treatment of </p><p>persons suffering from HIV/AIDS. </p><p>With the extension of the declaration of emergency--Zimbabwe </p><p>first declared a six-month emergency in May 2002--Zimbabwe </p><p>can get around patent restrictions to more easily access </p><p>patented HIV/AIDS drugs. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Comment: Even with this declaration of emergency, </p><p>Zimbabwe, which has one of the highest adult HIV infection </p><p>rates, will have a difficult time both producing and </p><p>importing drugs.  The economic crisis has crippled the health </p><p>care industry and the shortage of foreign exchange limits the </p><p>GOZ\'s ability to import drugs, even generics produced under </p><p>compulsory license from third countries.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
