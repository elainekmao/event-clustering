The DART food team attended a meeting with Coalition </p><p>forces and WFP on 15 April during which WFP requested that </p><p>Coalition forces provide security at warehouses, silos, and </p><p>mills.  Coalition forces agreed to try to provide security </p><p>to the food infrastructure sites and to assist in getting </p><p>essential fuel and water to the mills.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART food team attended a meeting on 15 April with </p><p>Coalition forces and the World Food Program (WFP).  The </p><p>purpose of the meeting was for WFP to describe its current </p><p>planning to the military and discuss how the Coalition </p><p>forces in Basrah could assist. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The primary request from WFP was for the Coalition </p><p>forces to provide security at the Ministry of Trade (MOT) </p><p>warehouses, silos, and mills.  WFP also requested </p><p>information regarding any pockets of insecurity in Iraq. </p><p>WFP is starting to test routes from the south, north, and </p><p>west and wants to be regularly briefed about any areas to </p><p>avoid.  A security incident could stop operations, which </p><p>could have drastic consequences due to the volume of food </p><p>that must be moved over the coming weeks.  WFP stated that </p><p>they "don\'t want to lose life to save life."  Coalition </p><p>forces agreed to pass along relevant information to WFP. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Coalition forces also agreed to try to provide security </p><p>to the food infrastructure sites and to assist in getting </p><p>power to the mills by bringing fuel for the generators and </p><p>the water necessary for milling.  Coalition forces also </p><p>agreed to begin paying MOT staff.  WFP specifically asked </p><p>the military not to get involved with locating or organizing </p><p>the public distribution system food/flour agents and not to </p><p>talk to any transporters. </p><p> </p><p>5.  On 15 April in Basrah, WFP national staff held a meeting </p><p>with the MOT directors, who agreed that staff for all three </p><p>warehouses would return to work on 16 April.  The MOT </p><p>directors will survey the condition of the warehouses and </p><p>determine what materials are needed for resumption of </p><p>operations.  According to WFP, the general condition of all </p><p>three warehouses is fairly good. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Beginning on 17 April, WFP national staff will start </p><p>meeting with Basra\'s 1,384 food agents.  Meetings will be </p><p>held with the agents of three ration centers at a time. </p><p>There are a total of 15 ration centers in Basrah.  WFP </p><p>national staff met with food agents in Khor-Zabyr on 15 </p><p>April and plan to go to Al Nasariyah on 17 April. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>RAPID ASSESSMENT PROCESS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Humanitarian Information Center (HIC) for Iraq is a </p><p>UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs- </p><p>facilitated team that is providing a focal point for </p><p>operational information management.  The HIC maintains a </p><p>website and several offices where information will be </p><p>assembled, managed, and disseminated.  The HIC focuses on </p><p>three types of information: baseline reference, assessments, </p><p>and response.  The HIC\'s role in assessments is to </p><p>coordinate the content and compile the findings.  This is </p><p>referred to as the Rapid Assessment Process (RAP).  The HIC </p><p>also maintains information related to the organizations, </p><p>locations, and sectors of humanitarian interventions. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, </p><p>Ramiro Lopez De Silva, formally endorsed the RAP and </p><p>approved the plan to re-establish the HIC in Iraq.   In his </p><p>letter of endorsement, Mr. De Silva strongly encouraged the </p><p>participation of the entire humanitarian community, as it is </p><p>essential to the success of the activity.  To make use of </p><p>the RAP and other information, the HIC will establish four </p><p>offices in Iraq with a total staff of 38, of which 24 will </p><p>be national staff.  This will allow for direct access to HIC </p><p>offices throughout the country and help ensure a smooth </p><p>transition to UNDP as the situation stabilizes.  The HIC </p><p>will continue to have a strong Internet presence at </p><p>www.agoodplacetostart.org and will be adding three people to </p><p>the Kuwait City office to meet growing demand. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
