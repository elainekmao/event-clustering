A delegation from Iraq will also attend </p><p>the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU officials warmer to Turkey: "Milliyet" reports a </p><p>`changing\' attitude of EU member countries regarding </p><p>Turkey\'s position vis--vis Europe, saying that EU leaders </p><p>began viewing Turkey as a trump card in their relations with </p><p>the Middle East.  The EU\'s foreign policy chief Javier </p><p>Solana said at the WEF meetings in Jordan that full </p><p>membership of Turkey to the Union would make Europe a </p><p>neighbor to the Middle East.  German Foreign Minister </p><p>Fischer said Turkey\'s EU membership was crucial for peace </p><p>and stability in the region. </p><p>National Program out for discussion: MFA officials have </p><p>briefed on Monday the cabinet on the 977-page National </p><p>Program for Turkey\'s EU drive, papers report.  Government </p><p>Spokesman Cicek said the draft would be discussed with the </p><p>opposition party CHP, and with some NGOs like Turkey\'s </p><p>businessmen\'s association TUSIAD as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prosecutor to file lawsuit against Uzan: Following a </p><p>complaint by Prime Minister Erdogan\'s lawyers on grounds of </p><p>insult and libel, the prosecutor\'s office has initiated an </p><p>investigation into Genc Party leader Cem Uzan\'s remarks </p><p>against Erdogan.  The investigation might lead the </p><p>prosecutor to demand up to three years prison sentence for </p><p>Uzan, papers say.  If convicted, Uzan will be banned from </p><p>politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Parliamentary investigation against former politicians: A </p><p>parliamentary commission against corruption has demanded </p><p>investigation against a number of certain political figures </p><p>for corruption and graft, reports say.  A former prime </p><p>minister and ex-ANAP chairman Mesut Yilmaz is accused of </p><p>irregularities in the Blue Stream natural gas agreement with </p><p>Russia, and in construction of the Black Sea motorway. </p><p>Former cabinet ministers Husamettin Ozkan (DSP), Gunes Taner </p><p>(ANAP), Cumhur Ersumer (ANAP), and Koray Aydin (MHP) are </p><p>also under investigation on claims of corruption regarding </p><p>energy, construction, and privatization contracts, reports </p><p>note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU funds for SE Turkey: EU\'s Turkey representation has </p><p>announced on Monday a decision to provide 500 million Euro </p><p>aid annually for the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) </p><p>until 2006, papers report.  EU representative Hans Jorg </p><p>Kretschner said special efforts are needed for </p><p>implementation of EU reforms, and noted that EU funds would </p><p>be spent for education and, social and cultural projects in </p><p>southeast Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iran / Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iran" </p><p>Ozgen Acar observed in social democrat-intellectual </p><p>Cumhuriyet (6/24): "It is interesting to see some comments </p><p>calling for the US to intervene in Iran as they did in Iraq. </p><p>The regime in Iran is not only an enemy to Turkey and its </p><p>secular system, but also it is hostile to democracy.  Yet I </p><p>would not sympathize with `the US should intervene in Iran\' </p><p>rationale.  . It is a well-known fact that at least during </p><p>the last 10 years Iran has been working on a nuclear weapons </p><p>development program.  Dictatorships such as Iran may use </p><p>nuclear weapons unexpectedly and this possibility itself is </p><p>a great threat to Turkey. . However, the motives behind the </p><p>nuclear armament should also be inquired into.  Iran\'s </p><p>nuclear weapons development began with the need to establish </p><p>a defense or offense  when necessary against Israel, which </p><p>has nuclear weapons as well.  What is the reason for the </p><p>IAEA not doing a nuclear arms inspection in Israel?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Lies and mistakes" </p><p>Zafer Atay wrote in the economic-political Dunya (6/24): </p><p>"Things are becoming a mess for the Bush administration </p><p>because of the way it seems the Hawks have built their Iraq </p><p>policy on lies and mistakes. . It seems very unlikely that </p><p>the American forces in Iraq will be able to find any weapons </p><p>of mass destruction.  All over the indications lead us to </p><p>the fact that the Saddam regime actually destroyed its WMD </p><p>prior to the UN inspection. . The US administration has made </p><p>another mistake by convincing itself that it is seen as the </p><p>savior of Iraq.  And the ongoing instability as well as </p><p>social disorder seems to be creating a very painful period </p><p>for the US administration.  It remains to be seen what other </p><p>consequences will occur after carrying out a policy filled </p><p>with lies and mistakes." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
