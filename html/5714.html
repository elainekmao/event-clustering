<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001040 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KIPR, TU, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH RESPONSE ON TRIPS MORATORIUM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 STATE 265619 </p><p>     B. STATE 26895 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Econoff delivered ref B demarche to MFA and the Foreign </p><p>Trade Undersecretariat.  Oya Karakas, MFA Head of Department </p><p>for Multilateral Economic Affairs, provided us with the </p><p>following response to Ambassador Zoellick\'s December letter </p><p>urging other countries to join the TRIPS Moratorium on </p><p>February 7.  In his letter, MFA Yasar Yakis supports our </p><p>decision to declare a moratorium, but does not specify </p><p>whether Turkey will join it.  Karakas told us the GOT </p><p>supported the effort to reach a multilateral consensus on </p><p>this issue, but that Turkey had not taken a decision to join </p><p>the USG in declaring a moratorium.  The text of the letter is </p><p>reproduced below: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ankara, 30 January 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Your Excellency, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With reference to your letter of 31 December 2002, concerning </p><p>the TRIPS Agreement and public health, I would like to </p><p>express my appreciation for your and your government\'s </p><p>efforts to find a solution to this issue affecting some </p><p>developing and least-developed countries facing a serious </p><p>public health crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As we have previously expressed on various occasions and </p><p>particularly during the discussions at the WTO, we attach </p><p>utmost importance to this issue.  In our view, public health </p><p>requires a particular attention and it has a certain priority </p><p>among other issues being discussed.  It is our very sincere </p><p>wish to find a solution to fulfil the mandate of the Doha </p><p>Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health.  Hence, </p><p>we are disappointed with the lack of progress at the WTO. </p><p>Nevertheless, we continue to look into the future with a view </p><p>to achieving consensus on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In this context, we welcome the decision of the United States </p><p>to declare a moratorium, while the negotiations are under </p><p>way.  In this connection, I appreciate your assurance that </p><p>you will continue to work with other members towards </p><p>achieving consensus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For my part, I would like to assure you that your proposal </p><p>and the points you have mentioned in your letter, will </p><p>receive my Government\'s due consideration and we will </p><p>continue to cooperate with you on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yasar Yakis </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  We also confirmed that Turkey\'s Ambassador to the WTO </p><p>reports to the MFA, not to the Turkish Foreign Trade </p><p>Undersecretariat or the State Minister for Foreign Trade. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
