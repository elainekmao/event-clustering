END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>Adverse Court Ruling </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In a widely anticipated decision foreshadowed </p><p>in Ref C, Sri Lanka\'s Supreme Court has shot down the </p><p>government\'s bid to rein in President Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>powers.  In its (highly technical) decision formally </p><p>announced on October 22, the court ruled that the </p><p>section of the government\'s proposed "19th" </p><p>constitutional amendment voiding the power of the </p><p>president to call an election one-year after the last </p><p>election required a national referendum.  This was a </p><p>sharp surprise to the government, which thought it would </p><p>only need two-thirds support in Parliament to pass the </p><p>proposed amendment.  The court did state that this </p><p>section of the proposed amendment could possibly pass </p><p>constitutional review if it was redrafted to read that </p><p>the president could only call a new election three years </p><p>after the last election.  If it was redrafted in this </p><p>fashion, the amendment could become law if it attained </p><p>two-thirds support in Parliament without need of a </p><p>referendum, the court stated.  As for the proposed </p><p>amendment\'s other key section, the court ruled that the </p><p>proposal to allow crossover voting in Parliament was </p><p>unconstitutional.  (Note:  See Ref C for additional </p><p>detail regarding the court\'s decision on the proposed </p><p>"19th" amendment.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) To add insult to injury, the Supreme Court </p><p>also ruled against the government\'s proposed "18th" </p><p>constitutional amendment.  The court ruled that the </p><p>proposed amendment\'s clauses providing immunity to </p><p>members of a constitutional council administering </p><p>independent commissions were unconstitutional unless </p><p>extensively redrafted.  In addition, a referendum was </p><p>needed for the proposed amendment\'s passage into law. </p><p>(Note:  In the 17th amendment passed last year, the </p><p>government agreed to set up independent commissions for </p><p>elections, the judiciary, police, and the civil service. </p><p>Because of disagreements over immunity and other issues, </p><p>the independent commissions are not yet in operation.) </p><p> </p><p>====================== </p><p>GSL Reaction Not Clear </p><p>====================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The government is still developing its reaction </p><p>to the adverse ruling.  In a press conference, G.L. </p><p>Peiris, the Minister for Constitutional Affairs, </p><p>indicated that the GSL was reluctant to press for a </p><p>referendum on the proposed "19th" amendment because the </p><p>subject was so narrow and complex that it did not lend </p><p>itself well to public debate.  Instead, Peiris </p><p>indicated, the government was seriously considering </p><p>trying to call a parliamentary election, which would </p><p>allow the public a clear choice between the PM and the </p><p>president.  (Note:  It is not clear whether the </p><p>constitution allows Parliament acting on its own to call </p><p>an election or whether it would need the president\'s </p><p>blessing.  For her part, the president has made clear </p><p>she has no plans to call an election.)  Peiris added </p><p>that the government was also mulling over whether it </p><p>should try to redraft the proposed "19th" amendment to </p><p>meet the court\'s concerns.  Discussing the issue with </p><p>the Ambassador, Milinda Moragoda, the Minister for </p><p>Economic Reform, related that the government had not </p><p>made any decisions on what to do and he did not expect </p><p>any soon.  The PM was still reviewing the issue, he </p><p>noted. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) While the government\'s next steps are still </p><p>being determined, it is clear that it has been sorely </p><p>embarrassed by the court\'s decision.  The press has been </p><p>full of articles querying how the GSL could have drafted </p><p>amendments that were so easily knocked down by the </p><p>court.  (Note:  Although the court is considered pro- </p><p>Kumaratunga in its composition, most observers believe </p><p>that its decision was reasonably well founded.) </p><p>Commenting on the government\'s predicament, Taranjit </p><p>Sandhu, polchief at the Indian High Commission, told us </p><p>that the government "really is looking incompetent on </p><p>this issue and had better gets its act together </p><p>quickly." </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>Fire on Another Front </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The GSL also continues to try to squelch a </p><p>mutiny by a dissident faction of Muslim MPs.  As </p><p>reported in Ref B, these MPs have basically rebelled </p><p>against the leader of their party, Rauf Hakeem of the </p><p>Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC).  The dissidents, who </p><p>number anywhere from three upwards, have demanded that </p><p>the government agree to create a council for Muslims in </p><p>the east as a condition for any interim negotiated </p><p>solution to the conflict with the Tamil Tigers.  While </p><p>it is not clear, the dissidents seem to be threatening </p><p>to bolt from the government\'s coalition or at least </p><p>boycott Parliament until their demands are met. For its </p><p>part, the government is working overtime to bring the </p><p>dissidents back into the fold.  (Note:  As related in </p><p>Ref B, if the MPs left the coalition, it could have a </p><p>serious impact on the governing coalition\'s slim </p><p>majority status.  Even with the Muslims out of the </p><p>equation, however, the government does not appear to be </p><p>any immediate danger of falling because it appears that </p><p>it can count on the support of Tamil MPs in any </p><p>parliamentary vote of confidence.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The leader of the dissidents is a controversial </p><p>figure.  A.L.M. Athaullah, 45, is the Minister for </p><p>Highways, a non-cabinet position.  He is from Ampara </p><p>District in the east and was a close associate of M.H.M. </p><p>Ashraff, the founder of the SLMC who died in 2000. </p><p>According to some observers, Athaullah has a thuggish </p><p>reputation and a bent toward Islamic communal thinking. </p><p>Moragoda told the Ambassador that Athaullah is using </p><p>Islamic extremist rhetoric in an attempt to whip up </p><p>anti-peace process opinion in the east.  Moragoda, who </p><p>encountered Athaullah during a recent visit to the east, </p><p>commented that he (Athaullah) seemed to be having some </p><p>success using this tack. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Given the confluence of its recent cohabitation </p><p>and coalition problems, the government is clearly taking </p><p>on some water.  The court decision, in particular, has </p><p>been one of the most serious setbacks it has suffered </p><p>since coming to power in December 2001.  Despite its </p><p>problems, the government still seems to maintain </p><p>widespread public support due to the popularity of its </p><p>peace initiative.  In light of its current problems, the </p><p>government might be tempted to try to get out of the box </p><p>it is now in by testing its presumed popularity with the </p><p>voters via a national election.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
