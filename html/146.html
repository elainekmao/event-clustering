<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 06632 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS, PREL, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE CAMPS WAR IN LEBANON </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SECRET/NOFORN - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE WAR OF THE CAMPS IN LEBANON CONTINUES </p><p>UNABATED WITH FIERCE FIGHTING.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, </p><p>LEBANESE POLITICIANS HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS ON THE WAR, </p><p>DEPENDING ON THEIR POLITICAL OPTIC.  THERE FOLLOWS OBSER- </p><p>VATIONS BY SEVERAL LEBANESE POLITICIANS IN CONVERSATIONS </p><p>WITH AMBASSADOR DECEMBER 3 AND 4.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE CAMPS WAR BETWEEN THE PALESTINIANS AND THE SHIA </p><p>AMAL FORCES CONTINUES TO RAGE.  NOW IN ITS SIXTH WEEK, </p><p>A MAJOR STRATEGIC CONFRONTATION CONTINUES AROUND SIDON. </p><p>THE RASHADIYAH CAMP NEAR TYRE  REMAINS ENCIRCLED. </p><p>SHATILA AND BURJ AL-BURAJINAH IN BEIRUT\'S SOUTHERN </p><p>SUBURBS CONTINUE UNDER RELENTLESS BOMBARDMENT.  AS </p><p>REPORTED BY DAO/BEIRUT, ELEMENTS OF THE MUSLIM 6TH AND </p><p>1ST BRIGADES OF THE LEBANESE ARMY HAVE JOINED WITH AMAL </p><p>IN THE SIEGES OF SHATILA AND BURJ AL-BURAJINAH.  THE </p><p>SYRIANS ARE PROVIDING AMMO AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT TO AMAL. </p><p>THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF UP TO 300 SYRIAN TROOPS </p><p>IN AMAL UNIFORMS JOINING THE FIGHTING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  NATIONAL LIBERALS PARTY PRESIDENT DANY CHAMOUN </p><p>(MARONITE CHRISTIAN) TOLD AMBASSADOR THAT HE IS DELIGHTED </p><p>WITH THE WAR OF THE CAMPS.  CHAMOUN SAID THAT AS LONG AS </p><p>THE SHIA AND THE PALESTINIANS ARE KILLING ONE ANOTHER AND </p><p>LEAVING THE CHRISTIANS ALONE, THE SITUATION IS JUST FINE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER FUAD BUTROS (ORTHODOX </p><p>CHRISTIAN) SEES THE CAMPS WAR AS ENHANCING THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>OF A RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN LEBANESE PRESIDENT GEMAYEL </p><p>AND SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSD.  BUTROS SAID THAT SYRIAN </p><p>FAILURE TO HAVE THEIR SURROGATE AMAL FIGHTERS ACHIEVE </p><p>VICTORY OVER THE PALESTINIANS HAS FURTHER UNDERMINED </p><p>ASSAD\'S POSITION, WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN WEAKENED BY </p><p>WESTERN PRESSURE FOLLOWING THE REVELATIONS OF SYRIAN- </p><p>SPONSORED TERRORIST ACTS.  BUTROS BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE </p><p>ASSAD IS WEAKENED, HE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO BE </p><p>ACCOMMODATING TO GEMAYEL. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  SHIA MODERATE DEPUTY RAFIQ SHAHIN (WHOSE CONSTITUENCY </p><p>OF NABATIYAH INCLUDES THE MAGHDUSHAH AREA WHICH COMMANDS </p><p>THE HEIGHTS OVERLOOKING SIDON) VIEWS THE WAR AS A SERIOUS </p><p>CHALLENGE TO THE SHIA POSITION.  SHAHIN TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT THE SHIA CANNOT AFFORD TO ALLOW THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF A PALESTINIAN ENCLAVE CENTERED AROUND </p><p>SIDON AND INCLUDING THE HEIGHTS OF MAGHDUSHAH.  IF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING AND HOLDING SUCH AN </p><p>ENCLAVE, SOUTHERN LEBANON AND THE SHIA WILL BE CUT IN </p><p>HALF.  THE PALESTINIANS WILL CONTROL ACCESS BETWEEN </p><p>BEIRUT AND THE SOUTH AND WILL BE IN A POSITION TO CHOKE </p><p>IT OFF AT ANY TIME.  FURTHERMORE, PALESTINIAN RETENTION </p><p>OF MAGHDUSHAH WILL PUT THE PALESTINIANS WITHIN A </p><p>KILOMETER OR TWO OF LAHAD\'S ISRAELI-SPONSORED "ARMY OF </p><p>SOUTH LEBANON."  SHAHIN SAID LAHAD\'S MILITIA OCCUPIES THE </p><p>TERRAIN BETWEEN JEZZINE AND SIDON, OVERLOOKING MAGHDUSHAH. </p><p>SHAHIN ASSERTED THAT A PALISTIANH CLAVE AROUND SIDO, </p><p>WOULD MEAN UNREMITTING PALESTINIAN OPERATIONS AGAINST </p><p>LAHAD AND ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  SHAHIN DESCRIBED AMAL LEADE NABIH BERRI\'S POSITION </p><p>AS UNDER GREAT PRESSURE FROM ALL SIDES.  IF BERRI AND </p><p>AMAL CANNOT REMOVE THE PALESTINIANS AROUND SIDON AND FORCE </p><p>THEM BACK INTO THE CAMPS, BERRI AND AMAL AS A COHESIVE </p><p>MOVEMENT WILL BE FINISHED.  THE DIVIDED SHIA COMMUNITY </p><p>WOULD THEN BE PREY TO EVEN MORE EXPLOITATION BY THE </p><p>IRANIAN-SPONSORED HIZBALLAH EXTREMISTS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  SHAHIN SAID THAT BECAUSE OF OQE CURRENT SITUATION, </p><p>HIZBALLAH FIGHTERS ARE FIGHTING AND DYING WITH AMAL. </p><p>SHAHIN\'S SON IN NABITIYAH DESCRIBED TO SHAHIN DECEMBER 3 </p><p>THE FUNERAL OF 15 SHIA FROM ONE VILLAGE:  12 AMAL </p><p>FIGHTERS AND 3 HIZBALLAH.  SHAHIN SAID HIZBALLAH IS ALSO </p><p>COOPERATING WITH AMAL AROUND TYRE AND IN BEIRUT.  THE </p><p>HIZBALLAH LEADERSHIP DOES NOT LIKE SUPPORTING BERRI BUT </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE BLOODSHED, THE SHIA ARE UNITED </p><p>AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SHAHIN ALSO DESCRIBED BLOODY ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY </p><p>BOTH SIDES AGAINST NON-COMBATTANTS, WOUNDED, AND </p><p>PRISONERS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  SHAHIN ALSO THOUGHT THAT THE FAILURE THUS FAR OF THE </p><p>SYRIAN-SUPPORTED AMAL EFFORT ENHANCES GEMAYEL\'S </p><p>LEVERAGE WITH ASSAD. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT:  IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS THIRD VERSION OF THE </p><p>CAMPS WAR DIFFERS FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO.  IF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS SUCCEED IN SECURING AN ENCLAVE IN AND AROUND </p><p>SIDON, THEY WILL HAVE SUCCEEDED IN CHANGING THE MILITARY </p><p>AND POLITICAL MAP OF LEBANON FROM BEIRUT TO THE </p><p>ISRAELI BORDER. </p><p> </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
