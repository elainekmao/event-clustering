Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand told the local </p><p>press that peace talks would likely start in April, while </p><p>Dinanath Sharma, senior-level Maoist leader and member of </p><p>the Maoist negotiating team, said he was ready to begin </p><p>talks at any time.  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of Physical </p><p>Planning and Works, and government-appointed peace talks </p><p>coordinator, expressed confidence that the peace talks would </p><p>succeed.  Minister Pun also reasserted that Maoist leaders </p><p>would not be arrested during peace talks.  Twenty more </p><p>Maoists were released from various jails throughout the </p><p>country.  Maoists reportedly have abducted two Nepali </p><p>Congress (Democratic) workers in Pyuthan District, accusing </p><p>them of being informants, while a splinter group of the </p><p>insurgents has stepped up extortion demands from teachers in </p><p>Sankhuwasabha District.  Maoists in Kaski District </p><p>reportedly are still widely engaged in recruiting, and are </p><p>storing weapons in the jungle and other hideouts, promising </p><p>a "vicious war" if talks failed.  The All Nepal National </p><p>Independent Students\' Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) </p><p>unlocked college campuses on March 16 after Tribhuvan </p><p>University (TU) reportedly agreed to fulfill their demands </p><p>(Ref A), but expressed anger at the Home Ministry\'s press </p><p>statement issued on March 16 that Purna Poudel, General </p><p>Secretary of ANNISU-R, was not in custody.  Devendra </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Parajuli, President of ANNISU-R, accused the GON of lying </p><p>about Poudel\'s whereabouts, and reportedly accused the </p><p>security personnel of murdering ANNISU-R cadres in custody. </p><p>ANNISU-R promised a "strong action" if their cadres were not </p><p>released.  The GON announced on March 16 that it plans to </p><p>reconstruct infrastructure destroyed during the Maoist </p><p>insurgency, and rehabilitate displaced people, particularly </p><p>children and widows.  The families of five youths mistakenly </p><p>killed in Nuwakot District by security forces in November </p><p>2002 (Ref B) are still waiting to receive compensation </p><p>promised to them by the GON. </p><p> </p><p>POSSIBLE START DATE FOR PEACE TALKS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand told the local </p><p>press on March 15 that peace talks would likely start in </p><p>April.  The Prime Minister said that the Maoists had </p><p>requested three weeks to inform all of their cadres of the </p><p>March 13 signing of the code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Dinanath Sharma, senior-level Maoist leader and member </p><p>of the Maoist negotiating team, told reporters on March 16 </p><p>that the focus of the peace talks should be on how much the </p><p>participants are willing to sacrifice and not how much they </p><p>want to gain.  Sharma also promised that more senior Maoists </p><p>would appear in public if the GON created a conducive </p><p>environment, declaring that they were ready to begin talks. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of Physical Planning and </p><p>Works and government-appointed peace talks coordinator, </p><p>expressed confidence on March 16 that the peace talks would </p><p>succeed, and said the GON was "on the right track." </p><p>Minister Pun also said that, because restoring the economy </p><p>of the country was vital to ensure that democracy </p><p>flourished, economics would be one of the prime topics of </p><p>the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>GON READY TO ACT ALONE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Prime Minister Chand announced on March 15 that the GON </p><p>would try again to involve the major political parties in </p><p>peace talks, but that the Government of Nepal (GON) was </p><p>ready to move ahead on its own if necessary.  Chand </p><p>reportedly dismissed the labeling of his government as </p><p>illegitimate, and expressed concern that the major political </p><p>parties might be trying to disrupt the peace process.  Chand </p><p>proclaimed that the GON was committed to maintaining peace </p><p>and accused the main parties of boycotting the peace </p><p>process.  (Note:  The major parties boycotted, for the </p><p>second time, an all-party meeting called by Prime Minister </p><p>Chand on March 11.  They had boycotted a previous all-party </p><p>meeting to which they were invited by Chand on February 17. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>PUN SAYS NO ARRESTS OF MAOIST LEADERS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Minister Pun said on March 19 that Maoist leaders would </p><p>not be arrested during peace talks.  Pun said the code of </p><p>conduct guaranteed freedom of movement by Maoist negotiators </p><p>and that the GON was committed to honoring the code. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Five Maoists were re-arrested shortly after their </p><p>release on March 16 in Jhapa District.  The detainees had </p><p>been in custody for three months.  The Chief District </p><p>Officer (CDO) said he was aware of their re-arrest but did </p><p>not know where they had been taken.  Two ANNISU-R cadres </p><p>were arrested on March 14 in Surkhet District while </p><p>attending an organizational meeting.  Devendra Parajuli, </p><p>President of ANNISU-R, said the arrests were a violation of </p><p>the code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>8.  In Salyan District, thirteen Maoists were released from </p><p>custody on March 18.  Security officials reportedly released </p><p>them to help generate support for the peace process.  Three </p><p>Maoists in Baglung District, including a journalist and a </p><p>teacher, and three from Sarlahi District were also released </p><p>this week.  A senior-level Maoist arrested in Damauli </p><p>District by army personnel a week after the announcement of </p><p>the ceasefire was released on March 20. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST CADRES IGNORE CODE OF CONDUCT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  Maoists reportedly have abducted two Nepali Congress </p><p>(Democratic) workers in Pyuthan District on March 19. The </p><p>insurgents have accused them of being informants for </p><p>security forces prior to the ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Maoist affiliated Kirant Worker\'s Party (KWP) </p><p>apparently has shunned the code of conduct guidelines and </p><p>reportedly are extorting money from school teachers in </p><p>Sankhuwasabha District.  The KWP activists allegedly are </p><p>armed and visiting schools demanding portions of the </p><p>teachers\' salaries. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Locals in west-central Baglung District are still </p><p>unable to return home because the Maoists have not </p><p>relinquished control of their land even after the ceasefire. </p><p>According to local press accounts, over a hundred people </p><p>have been displaced throughout the district after the </p><p>insurgents seized their land, some of which was taken after </p><p>the announcement of the ceasefire.  Maoist leaders in the </p><p>eastern district of Ilam reportedly are asking people to </p><p>return to their homes.  Many of the villagers have stayed </p><p>away despite the ceasefire, however, out of fear they will </p><p>be forced again by Maoists to make monetary contributions. </p><p>The insurgents have apparently told the villagers it was </p><p>safe for them to return and had nothing to fear if they did </p><p>not take any action against the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Local journalists met with Maoists in the central hill </p><p>district of Kaski on March 18 and reported that the </p><p>insurgents are still widely engaged in recruiting, and are </p><p>storing weapons in the jungle and other hideouts.  The </p><p>Maoists have also shunned offers of food by the "feudal </p><p>rulers and imperialists" and allegedly have said they do not </p><p>accept these acts of "so-called cooperation" by the </p><p>government.  The district leader also warned that if the </p><p>talks failed there would be a vicious war. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Maoists reportedly issued a statement on March 15 </p><p>demanding that the GON supply food to villagers in Baglung </p><p>District.  The food depots there are empty due to earlier </p><p>raids by the insurgents, and many people throughout the </p><p>district reportedly are facing a severe food crisis.  The </p><p>GON already has been supplying rice. </p><p> </p><p>ANNISU-R UNLOCKS COLLEGES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The All Nepal National Independent Students\' Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) unlocked college campuses on March </p><p>16 after Tribhuvan University (TU) reportedly agreed to </p><p>fulfill their demands, which included the release of all </p><p>imprisoned students; the release of information on the </p><p>whereabouts of Purna Poudel, General Secretary of ANNISU-R; </p><p>an immediate end to arrests of pro-Maoist students; a ban on </p><p>security forces inside campuses; and the admission of pro- </p><p>Maoist students to government-run universities. </p><p>The militant student wing of the Maoists had padlocked </p><p>branches throughout the country of government-run Tribhuvan </p><p>University since March 9 (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>15.  ANNISU-R cadres reacted angrily to the Home Ministry\'s </p><p>press statement issued on March 16 that Purna Poudel, </p><p>General Secretary of ANNISU-R, was not in custody, nor were </p><p>there any records of him being detained.  Devendra Parajuli, </p><p>President of ANNISU-R, held a press conference on March 19 </p><p>and declared that the GON was lying about Poudel\'s </p><p>whereabouts, and that army and police personnel had arrested </p><p>Poudel on April 26, 2002.  Parajuli also reportedly accused </p><p>security personnel of murdering ANNISU-R cadres in custody. </p><p>Poudel insisted that the GON reveal the whereabouts of all </p><p>its missing cadres and release them or face a "strong </p><p>movement against the government." </p><p> </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION PLANS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  On March 14 Kulchandra Gautam, Assistant Secretary </p><p>General of the United Nations (UN) and Deputy Executive of </p><p>UNICEF, said in Kathmandu that the UN could play a pivotal </p><p>role in the reconstruction of Nepal once the current </p><p>conflict is resolved.  Gautam said that there was much </p><p>sympathy within the international community for Nepal and </p><p>that many governments would be agreeable to launch </p><p>humanitarian and reconstructive programs for the regions hit </p><p>hardest by the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>17.  The GON announced on March 16 that it plans to </p><p>reconstruct infrastructure destroyed during the Maoist </p><p>insurgency and rehabilitate displaced people.  The National </p><p>Planning Commission (NCP) said priority would be given to </p><p>district headquarters, bridges, airports, school buildings, </p><p>health clinics, road repair, and communication systems.  Job </p><p>training and shelter would also be available for those </p><p>displaced as a result of the insurgency.  The GON\'s figures </p><p>show that almost three thousand people have been displaced, </p><p>but many human rights organizations claim the number is much </p><p>higher.  There is no date set for when these programs will </p><p>begin. </p><p> </p><p>18.  The GON announced a rehabilitation program on March 19 </p><p>for over one thousand children in the mid and far western </p><p>districts.  The program is aimed at helping those children </p><p>affected by the insurgency as well as women who were </p><p>widowed.  Under the program, the children would receive free </p><p>education, lodging and food while the widows would have the </p><p>opportunity to obtain interest-free loans for start-up </p><p>businesses.  Critics of the program, however, have deemed it </p><p>as inadequate and limited to only a handful of insurgency </p><p>victims. </p><p> </p><p>19.  In direct contrast to past statements of party </p><p>objectives, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, member of the Maoist </p><p>negotiation team, said on March 19 that the economy is the </p><p>basic foundation of the country and that it was important to </p><p>develop a free market economy.  Mahara said the business </p><p>community has many troubles that need to be solved before </p><p>Nepal\'s economy can prosper, and his party has developed a </p><p>seventy-five-point plan.  No details of this plan have been </p><p>provided.  Maoists traditionally have discouraged private </p><p>sector growth and made numerous threats against foreign </p><p>businesses and investors. </p><p> </p><p>GON SLOW WITH COMPENSATION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  The families of five youths mistakenly killed in </p><p>Nuwakot District by security forces in November 2002 (Ref B) </p><p>are still waiting to receive compensation promised to them </p><p>by the GON.  Despite frequent visits to the District </p><p>Administration Office (DAO) the families have been sent away </p><p>repeatedly empty-handed.  The Chief of the DAO said he has </p><p>not received the money from the GON, but would give it to </p><p>the families as soon as he did. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
