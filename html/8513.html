<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS AND AF/S RAYNOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MASS ACTION IN ZIM; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Editorials in the June 5 editions of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" and the </p><p>      pro-government "Business Tribune" concentrated on </p><p>      the continuing mass action in Zimbabwe called by the </p><p>      opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to </p><p>      pressure the Mugabe administration to the </p><p>      negotiating table as a lead up to arresting the </p><p>      run-away economic meltdown in the country. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Saboteurs must face wrath of law" the </p><p>      "Chronicle" (06/05) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The devil has been unmasked.  It is clear who the </p><p>      nation\'s enemy is.  The businesses that closed on </p><p>      Monday confirmed what has always been our suspicion </p><p>      - that they are working in cahoots with the </p><p>      opposition MDC to sabotage the economy.  . .The </p><p>      nation cannot continue to be fooled by these </p><p>      saboteurs who claim their action is meant to protect </p><p>      property. . .Those who wine and dine with the enemy </p><p>      are accomplices and should be treated as </p><p>      such. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Politicians playing into West\'s hands" </p><p>      the pro-government weekly "Business Tribune" (06/05) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .In the end, both ZANU-PF and the MDC are </p><p>      playing into the hands of the West.  On the one </p><p>      hand, ZANU-PF believes it will eventually subdue </p><p>      what they label the West\'s surrogate (the MDC) by </p><p>      using the state machinery while on the other the MDC </p><p>      looks up to the West\'s economic and military muscle </p><p>      to effect a regime change.  . .They are both bound </p><p>      to fail.  Meanwhile the West will be the victor as </p><p>      the destruction of the economy continues until total </p><p>      collapse. . .whoever is going to preside over the </p><p>      ashes will have to appeal for Western assistance and </p><p>      the West will only be too happy to give it - with </p><p>      strings attached. . .The mass action must have been </p><p>      quite embarrassing to both Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun </p><p>      Obasanjo. . .Uppermost in their minds could be how </p><p>      Zimbabwe has continued to display to the world its </p><p>      political immaturity.  Zimbabweans should now rise </p><p>      above their bovine intelligence and begin to behave </p><p>      like people who appreciate the extent of the </p><p>      Zimbabwean crisis." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
