<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bush must demand that Mbeki act on </p><p>      Zimbabwe" the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>      dedicated its July 9 editorial to calling on </p><p>      President George W. Bush  "to use his immense </p><p>      influence to pressure" South African President Thabo </p><p>      Mbeki to stand up for democracy and good governance </p><p>      by acting on Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The economic aid and development support that </p><p>      Bush is dangling before the continent pales into </p><p>      insignificance when compared with the damage caused </p><p>      to Africa\'s weak economies by the United States\' </p><p>      protectionist trade policies.  But we totally agree </p><p>      with Bush on one count, and that is that regional </p><p>      powerhouse South Africa must abandon its ineffective </p><p>      policy of so-called `quiet diplomacy\' and lead the </p><p>      way in pressuring President Robert Mugabe and his </p><p>      ruling ZANU PF party to abandon ruinous policies </p><p>      that have brought this once prosperous country to </p><p>      its knees.  Bush must not be swayed or blackmailed </p><p>      by the usual cheap accusations of racism or arrogant </p><p>      imperialism by South African President Thabo Mbeki </p><p>      and others. . .who. . .are only interested in buying </p><p>      more time for Mugabe and his administration.  The U. </p><p>      S. leader must take comfort in the knowledge that </p><p>      the majority of ordinary Zimbabweans. . .support his </p><p>      call that Zimbabwe return to democracy.  We urge </p><p>      Bush to use his immense influence to pressure Mbeki </p><p>      to stop covering up for Mugabe.  Bush must tell </p><p>      Mbeki what all of us have tried to tell the South </p><p>      African leader but in vain.  That is that Mbeki </p><p>      should vigorously lead the Southern African </p><p>      Development Community and the rest of the </p><p>      international community in demanding that Mugabe </p><p>      step down to pave the way for a transitional </p><p>      government that will be tasked with organizing fresh </p><p>      and truly democratic elections in Zimbabwe.  Bush </p><p>      has already started his African safari on a high </p><p>      note by forcing Charles Taylor to leave power and </p><p>      give Liberia a chance to start all over again.  We </p><p>      see absolutely no reason why he should fail to </p><p>      emulate Henry Kissinger\'s diplomatic triumph in </p><p>      Pretoria in 1976, when he got John Vorster. . .to </p><p>      turn the screws on Ian Smith. . .until the white </p><p>      supremacist agreed to black majority rule. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
