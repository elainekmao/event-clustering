The DART conducted a security assessment of Al Hillah, </p><p>capital of the Babil governorate, on 2 May.  The town has </p><p>approximately 400,000, mostly Shia, residents.  Coalition </p><p>forces ranked the threat assessment as "low to none," but </p><p>acknowledged that there was a problem with organized crime. </p><p>There have not been any security incidents in the last ten </p><p>days, and DART security team declared Al Hillah permissive </p><p>for DART operations.  Coalition forces reported finding </p><p>several caches of UXOs, ammunition dumps, mine fields, and </p><p>weapons in the city.  There are no acute shortages of any </p><p>basic necessities or utilities in the town, although the </p><p>communities in the surrounding area were reported to be in </p><p>greater need of assistance and services.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>FOOD SECURITY </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART observed no shortage of food and produce </p><p>available in the local markets in Al Hillah.  Coalition </p><p>forces reported that the normal distribution network under </p><p>the Oil for Food (OFF) program has remained in place.  There </p><p>are 1,730 food agents for the approximately 1.8 million </p><p>residents of Babil governorate, with 10 local United Nations </p><p>(U.N.) OFF workers to monitor the program in the region. </p><p>Food deliveries were suspended for about two months during </p><p>the hostilities, but deliveries resumed on 30 April.  Most </p><p>of the grain under the OFF program for Al Hillah is </p><p>processed in the immediate area at 14 privately owned mills. </p><p>Although there are currently no shortages of food, problems </p><p>have been reported with distributions due to a lack of bags. </p><p>Coalition forces reported that the local residents have </p><p>raised concerns about shortages of soy protein for chickens. </p><p>Also, the price of propane gas, which the majority of the </p><p>population uses for cooking purposes, has increased </p><p>dramatically. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>WATER AND SANITATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART saw no evidence of significant water or </p><p>sanitation-related needs during its visit to Al Hillah.  No </p><p>residents were seen collecting water from surface water </p><p>sources.  Information on the status of the Al Hillah water </p><p>facilities was gained from Coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The water facilities in Al Hillah were operating at 75 </p><p>percent of capacity at the time of the DART assessment.  The </p><p>availability and quantity of water to Al Hillah and outlying </p><p>communities is good.  The Al Hillah province is served by </p><p>fifteen water treatment plants, three of which produce the </p><p>majority of the water for the province.  Coalition forces </p><p>were providing technical assistance and supplies for </p><p>maintenance in both Al Hillah and outlying communities.  All </p><p>repair activities were conducted in conjunction with, and </p><p>approval of, the local water and sewer utility managers. </p><p>The primary problem faced by the utility is the lack of </p><p>power.  Efforts are being made to support water and sewer </p><p>facilities with backup generators and fuel. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The DART recommends that every effort be made to restore </p><p>the main power grid for Al Hillah.  Non-governmental </p><p>organizations (NGOs) should be encouraged to visit outlying </p><p>communities to further assess and address water and </p><p>sanitation needs. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>ABUSE PREVENTION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  There are no confirmed reports of reprisal killings, but </p><p>revenge attacks are taking place.  In one instance, </p><p>Coalition forces reported that one of the lawyers in town </p><p>was attacked for helping the military locate a former Ba\'ath </p><p>Party member.  His home was attacked by small arms fire, but </p><p>no one was hurt.  The local police responded and arrested </p><p>the individual.  According to the local police chief, </p><p>approximately ten prisoners are being held by the police, </p><p>but Coalition forces have yet to confirm this information. </p><p>There are approximately 250 police operating in Al Hillah. </p><p>Coalition forces provided the police force with AK-47s on 2 </p><p>May.  The Coalition has already provided a three-day police </p><p>training program and plans to offer another course soon. </p><p> </p><p>7.  A group of lawyers educated at the Babylon University </p><p>Law School have started a human rights organization to </p><p>educate Iraqis on the human rights abuses conducted by the </p><p>former regime as well as teaching human rights principles. </p><p>The group has occupied the former secret police building and </p><p>has issued a document in both Arabic and English proclaiming </p><p>democratic ideals and human rights principles. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>LAW AND ORDER </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Coalition forces are in the process of replacing Ba\'ath </p><p>party judges with new judges and employing 250 Iraqi police. </p><p>The replacement of the judges was predicated on the </p><p>understanding that Ba\'ath party judges functioned as both </p><p>prosecutor and judge, a practice which led to a high </p><p>conviction rate.  According to Coalition forces, local </p><p>residents have reported that people would be accused of </p><p>crimes and then sent to jail for a year without a trial </p><p>regardless of their crime.  Approximately 70 judges have </p><p>been relieved of their duties, and five new judges will </p><p>assume their positions 9 May. </p><p> </p><p>9.  As for the police, apparently there are as many as 250 </p><p>police candidates who have been identified as potential </p><p>officers.  In order to create a "U.S.-type" of police force, </p><p>Coalition forces have begun a three-day police training </p><p>course.  One of the anticipated roles of the police is to </p><p>man the six police sub-stations located throughout the city. </p><p>There are no operable phone lines or radio communications </p><p>between the substations and the central headquarters.  It is </p><p>hoped that by posting Coalition forces at the headquarters </p><p>and local police at the substations, the security presence </p><p>will be increased throughout the city. </p><p> </p><p>10.  There have been no reports of insurgency or armed </p><p>resistance around Al Hillah.  However, significant weapons </p><p>caches have been found, presenting a disposal problem.  In </p><p>one site, there are reportedly two full warehouses stacked </p><p>from floor to ceiling with munitions.  Another problem is </p><p>that in areas where munitions have been found, some locals </p><p>have been emptying out the contents to collect the boxes, </p><p>and in other situations locals have collected the munitions </p><p>themselves. </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
