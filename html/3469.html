<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001819 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, EAGR, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GLOOMY COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION CONGRESS ADJOURNS </p><p>AS SECTION 8 EVICTION DEADLINE LOOMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHG REWhitehead due to 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The 59th annual Commercial Farmers, Union </p><p>(CFU) Congress was a gloomy affair that took place under the </p><p>pall of an August 8 deadline for the eviction of the majority </p><p>of CFU members from their farms.  There was unusual division </p><p>within CFU ranks over whether or not to mount court </p><p>challenges to the eviction orders as well as to an expensive </p><p>and compulsory worker retrenchment package, or whether to </p><p>continue the elected  CFU leadership,s thus far fruitless </p><p>attempt at non-confrontational dialogue with the GOZ.  There </p><p>was also a split between farmers who will remain on their </p><p>farms in defiance of the deadline, and those who had chosen </p><p>to vacate.  Acting Agriculture Minister Ignatius Chombo and </p><p>several other ZANU-PF heavyweights attended the closing </p><p>ceremony, which was addressed by Vice President Joseph Msika. </p><p> His remarks contained little new, and yielded nothing </p><p>promising on the looming Section 8 deadline.  Msika concluded </p><p>with a pointed threat to the Justice for Agriculture (JAG) </p><p>group, which has split from the CFU and favors legal </p><p>confrontation with the GOZ.  In his response, CFU President </p><p>Cloete pitched for dialogue and an extension of the eviction </p><p>deadline, which prompted a scornful response from Chombo and </p><p>other GOZ hardliners in a following press interview.  CFU </p><p>leaders attempted to put a positive spin on Msika,s more </p><p>conciliatory remarks -- a stretch from where we sat -- as </p><p>what may have been the last CFU Congress adjourned.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>A Mournful Affair </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Econoff attended preliminary open sessions of the </p><p>CFU Congress, and the Charge participated in the closing </p><p>ceremony.  It was a gloomy affair overall, given that the </p><p>first tranche of 1,800 of the CFU,s remaining 3,000 plus </p><p>members were facing a midnight August 8 deadline to vacate </p><p>their farms, totaling some 2,500 properties, or face fines </p><p>and possible imprisonment.  The strain of the deadline </p><p>compounded by three years of violence and stress had clearly </p><p>taken their toll on the CFU.  In closed sessions, there were </p><p>reportedly deep internal fissures in what has traditionally </p><p>been a very cohesive group.  The sessions featured heated </p><p>exchanges over whether or not the CFU should challenge </p><p>exorbitant GOZ-mandated retrenchment packages for their farms </p><p>workers  in court, or whether the increasingly cash-strapped </p><p>farmers should pay the severance, as mandated by law, before </p><p>leaving their properties.  The CFU took no formal decision on </p><p>whether members should leave their farms before the eviction </p><p>deadline, largely because there was a lack of consensus on </p><p>this point.  Some delegates stated that they intended to defy </p><p>the deadline, while others said that they would vacate </p><p>temporarily and see what transpired. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Msika Calls for Unity, Then Rattles the Saber </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  A surprisingly top-heavy ZANU-PF delegation </p><p>composed of VP Msika (acting President in Mugabe,s absence); </p><p> Minister of Local Government, Works, and Housing (and acting </p><p>Agriculture Minister) Ignatius Chombo; hard-line Mashonaland </p><p>West Chanetsa, and Minister of State Olivia Muchena attended </p><p>the closing ceremony.  Following an oleaginous introduction </p><p>by Chombo and a fulsome welcome by CFU President Colin </p><p>Cloete, Msika proceeded to review GOZ policy over the past </p><p>year, including the Section 5 and 8 seizure mechanism and the </p><p>mandated limitations on farm sizes.  He stressed that the </p><p>fast track land reform program would move forward to </p><p>completion but that it would respect its own iternal </p><p>regulations.  He made no specific mention of any grace period </p><p>for the August 8 deadline but noted that the GOZ has delisted </p><p>689 farms comprising a total of 1.69 million hectares </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Msika expressed the GOZ,s willingness to continue </p><p>dealing with the Zimbabwean Joint Resettlement Initiative </p><p>(ZJRI), a CFU-backed attempt to identify and donate </p><p>commercial farmland for resettlement, complete with a </p><p>financial package to assist the resettled farmers start up. </p><p>However, he criticized the slowness of the effort and the </p><p>limited amount of land offered up and accused the CFU of </p><p>resisting land reform from the outset.  Msika added that he </p><p>hoped that within the next year the "white" CFU and the </p><p>"indigenous" Zimbabwean Farmers\' Union would be blended into </p><p>a single organization.  He delivered a blunt warning to the </p><p>"small clique amongst you" ) clearly the dissident JAG -- </p><p>who favored confrontation with government over dialogue.  He </p><p>stressed that they would face "the full wrath of the law" and </p><p>that the government would not be deterred from action by </p><p>external influence. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On a more conciliatory note, Msika declared that he </p><p>was not and had never been a racist, that he deplored racism, </p><p>and that his reference to "our people" extended across the </p><p>color line to all Zimbabweans.  He further insisted that </p><p>there was room and space for all who wished to stay and </p><p>encouraged CFU members who wished to farm to complete and </p><p>submit the required forms expeditiously, or even to contact </p><p>his office.  He announced that no one would be rendered </p><p>homeless by the land reform process. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>The Response </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) CFU President Cloete responded by pointing out that </p><p>the CFU had always opted for dialogue with the GOZ, which </p><p>until recently had been refused.  He noted that the GOZ had </p><p>offered no mechanism through which lands identified by the </p><p>ZJRI could be transferred.  He bemoaned the chaos and </p><p>warlordism associated with the fast track program, and </p><p>lamented the breakdown of law and order that had translated </p><p>into violence against, and even the murder of, many farmers. </p><p>Cloete rejected the confrontational approach of the JAG and </p><p>said that the CFU stood ready to work with the Government. </p><p>He urged the Government to re-examine the Section 8 deadline </p><p>before it came into effect. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) A representative of the commercial farmers  of </p><p>Namibia delivered a pledge of solidarity for the CFU and </p><p>requested  concrete proposals on how their Namibian </p><p>counterparts could be of assistance.  A Mr. Roth representing </p><p>Agric SA, a South African counterpart group, subsequently </p><p>took the floor and in an unexpected turn of events proceeded </p><p>to lambaste the GOZ for "outrageous economic policies that </p><p>were ruining Zimbabwe and harming the region."  He continued </p><p>in the same vein, with the CFU leaders at the head table </p><p>squirming and the ZANU-PF heavyweights in the front row </p><p>increasingly outraged as Roth blasted the "wimpy" South </p><p>African Government for its lack of response and castigated </p><p>"other countries represented here" for sitting on their </p><p>hands. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Fallout </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Charge spoke with CFU Vice Presidents Douglas </p><p>Taylor-Freeme and William Hughes following the ceremony. </p><p>Taylor-Freeme, who has been on and off his farm in the </p><p>volatile Chinhoyi region for several months, confirmed that </p><p>he would pass the weekend at Lake Kariba and take stock of </p><p>what follows.  Hughes said that he would return to his farm </p><p>an hour outside of Harare and take his chances.  He explained </p><p>that the farm was valued at Zimbabwe dollar 1.4 billion (USD </p><p>2 million at the parallel rate) and that he and his family </p><p>had no holdings of any kind outside of Zimbabwe.  He had no </p><p>choice but to stick it out, although he hoped that if he were </p><p>forcibly expelled, it would be by police arrest and not mob </p><p>action.  Taylor-Freeme estimated that 1,200-1,400 of the </p><p>1,800 affected were still on their farms, but he did not have </p><p>accurate information on how many would stay put in spite of </p><p>the deadline.  Both he and Hughes believed that violent </p><p>episodes were unlikely, but could only speculate on hotspots </p><p>or the potential magnitude of the problem.  The outcome would </p><p>determine how other CFU members remaining on their farms </p><p>would  react as their own Section 8 deadlines fell due. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Hughes was surprisingly upbeat on Msika,s remarks, </p><p>focusing on the "room for all" and positive ZJRI rhetoric. </p><p>He admitted that the "no one left homeless" remark was </p><p>mystifying, in that a large number of farmers who had been </p><p>driven off their farms before the Section 8 deadline are for </p><p>all practical purposes already homeless.  Hughes said that </p><p>many others are either broke or deeply in debt, their plight </p><p>further aggravated by the GOZ-mandated retrenchment packages. </p><p> He scoffed at Msika,s mention of 689 Setion 8 delistings, </p><p>noting that this had been handled strictly along color lines </p><p>and that virtually all beneficiaries have been indigenous </p><p>Zimbabwean farmers.  He said that 98 percent of </p><p>non-indigenous farms have been listed and offered the view </p><p>that the remaining two percent had been temporarily spared by </p><p>administrative oversights. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The ZANU-PF contingent marched out in formation </p><p>immediately after the closing session, and their take can </p><p>only be judged from the government press, which  accurately </p><p>reflected Msika,s remarks.   It also quoted Chombo as </p><p>labeling the Congress as "lily white" and "racist" with "raw </p><p>attitudes" that "refuse to share land."  Minister of State </p><p>Olivia Muchena echoed him, accusing the CFU members of </p><p>"racist tactics" and predicting that "what is happening in </p><p>Zimbabwe is also going to take place to white racist farmers </p><p>in South Africa." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  The CFU appeared dispirited, unusually disorganized, </p><p>and increasingly a spent force.  Neither Taylor-Freeme nor </p><p>Hughes could provide precise figures on how many CFU members </p><p>remain on the farms or how many have already emigrated, a </p><p>startling admission from an organizaton that a year ago was </p><p>probably the best organized and informed lobby in Zimbabwe. </p><p>Hughes, who is leaving his Vice Presidential slot, said that </p><p>the CFU executive is downsizing and that he will not be </p><p>replaced.  The CFU has been unable to find a qualified </p><p>replacement for its public relations director, who defected </p><p>to JAG, and has no accurate figures on how many of its </p><p>members have actually followed her lead.  Cloete made it </p><p>clear, however, that despite these challenges the CFU </p><p>leadership remains committed to dealing non-confrontatially </p><p>with the GOZ.  As Hughes pointed out, Mugabe himself has </p><p>already stated that the GOZ will not respect court decisions </p><p>that it does not agree with, and the regime has at its </p><p>disposal all the forces required to counter a strategy of </p><p>confrontation. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Hughes\' attempt at a positive take on Msika,s </p><p>remarks struck us as grasping at straws.  Msika said nothing </p><p>new in the speech, and his rhetoric about space for all, </p><p>unity, and a home for everyone has not been borne out by </p><p>developments on the ground.  Barring a prompt and radical GOZ </p><p>policy change over the next few days,  highly unlikely in </p><p>Mugabe,s absence, we take Msika,s statements as words for </p><p>the wind.  The ZANU-PF instinct for crushing any opposition </p><p>to its monopoly on power, so ably displayed in its dealings </p><p>with the MDC, would appear to extend to the CFU as well.  The </p><p>question that was never answered at the glum 59th CFU </p><p>Congress was whether or not this would be its last. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
