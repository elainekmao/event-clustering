HE STATED THAT VIOLENCE ON THE </p><p>FARMS HAD BEEN STARTED BY WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND BY </p><p>"PEOPLE WHO DID NOT WANT TO SHARE."  HE INSISTED THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAD NOT DEVIATED FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF THE 1998 </p><p>DONORS\' CONFERENCE, IS PEACE LOVING AND BELIEVES IN THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW.  HE SAID THAT "EXTERNAL FORCES" HAD MADE THE LAND REFORM </p><p>ISSUE "MORE COMPLICATED" AND HAD MADE "PEOPLE DO THINGS THEY </p><p>SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE."  AS MSIKA EXPLAINED IT, THE </p><p>PEASANTS\' </p><p>HUNGER FOR LAND, THE PEOPLE\'S ANGER, AND THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>"CRIMINALS MASQUERADING AS EX-COMBATANTS," RESULTED IN THE </p><p>OCCUPATION OF FARMS THAT DID NOT MEET THE GOZ CRITERIA FOR </p><p>SEIZURE.  AS EVIDENCE OF THE GOZ DETERMINATION TO ABIDE BY </p><p>THE RULE OF LAW, HE DETAILED HIS EFFORTS TO REMOVE MORE THAN </p><p>600 FARMS FROM THE LIST OF PROPERTIES APPROVED FOR SEIZURE.  HE </p><p>DID NOT EXPLAIN HOW FARMS THAT DID NOT MEET GOZ CRITERIA FOR </p><p>ON TO SAY THAT THE GOZ HAD NEVER DEVIATED FROM ITS PRINCIPLED </p><p>STAND ON LAND REFORM OR THE RULE OF LAW, AND THAT THE ABUJA </p><p>AGREEMENT OF SEPTEMBER CONFIRMED THE JUSTICE OF ITS POLICIES </p><p>AND ACTIONS.  MSIKA SAID THAT ZIMBABWE\'S LAND PROBLEMS EXISTED </p><p>BEFORE THE ABUJA AGREEMENT AND WOULD TAKE MORE TIME TO RESOLVE. </p><p>HE AGAIN MADE THE POINT THAT ZINBABWE HAD "SUFFERED FROM </p><p>LAND REFORM, RULE OF LAW, ELECTION OBSERVATION </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INTERFERENCE THAT COMPLICATED OUR PATH." </p><p>AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN URGED MSIKA TO PREVENT FUTURE VIOLENCE AND </p><p>TO CONTINUE TO MOVE INVADERS OFF OF ILLEGALLY OCCUPIED FARMS. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HARARE  03367  131457Z </p><p>6. ( C ) AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN RAISED THE ISSUE OF ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVERS, EXPRESSING THE HOPE THAT THE GOZ WOULD INVITE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND ASKING WHEN A DECISION MIGHT BE </p><p>MADE ON THAT ISSUE.  MSIKA REPLIED THAT IT WAS HIS "CONVICTION" </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE WOULD BE HAPPY TO INVITE OBSERVERS OR MONITORS IF </p><p>AND WHEN THEY WERE NEEDED.  THE VP MADE A CLEAR DISTINCTION </p><p>BETWEEN OBSERVERS AND MONITORS AND SAID HE SAW NO NEED FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MONITORS IN ZIMBABWE.  MSIKA EXPRESSED ANGER OVER </p><p>WHAT HE CHARACTERIZED AS THE EU "DEMAND" THAT OBSERVERS BE </p><p>INVITED.  HE SAID THAT ZIMBABWE\'S SOVEREIGNTY AND INDEPENDENCE </p><p>ARE "NOT NEGOTIABLE" AND THAT NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO DEMAND </p><p>THAT THE GOZ INVITE OBSERVERS.  HE SAID THAT ZIMBABWE HAD </p><p>NOTHING TO HIDE AND POINTED TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S DEFEAT IN THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 2000 CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM AS EVIDENCE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S CAPACITY TO RUN FAIR ELECTIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR MADE </p><p>THE POINT THAT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS ARE STANDARD PRACTICE </p><p>AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN THE US, AND THAT THEY ENHANCE </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN ELECTION RESULTS AND REDUCE THE RISK OF ELECTION- </p><p>RELATED VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE NOT THE ENEMY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. ( C ) MSIKA ENDED THE MEETING BY SAYING THAT ZIMBABWE NEEDED </p><p>THE US - NEEDED ITS BUSINESS, ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT.  HE THEN </p><p>ASKED WHY THE US WANTED TO "MAKE ZIMBABWE YOUR ENEMY - WE ARE </p><p>NOT THE ENEMY."  MSIKA RECOUNTED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE US </p><p>DURING THE 1988 ELECTIONS AND HAD BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE ABILITY </p><p>OF AMERICANS FROM DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES TO DISCUSS </p><p>ISSUES.  HE SAID THAT HAD TAUGHT HIM AN IMPORTANT LESSON ABOUT </p><p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW AND THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        HARARE  03367  131457Z </p><p>HE HOPED THAT HE AND THE AMBASSADOR COULD CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN </p><p>OPEN, HONEST DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>8. ( C ) VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA\'S VERSION OF ZIMBABWE\'S RECENT </p><p>ON LAND REFORM AND RULE OF LAW, FOLLOWS VERY CLOSELY RECENT </p><p>STATEMENTS BY PRESIDENT MUGABE AND OTHER HIGH-RANKING GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS.  THEY CLEARLY HAVE A UNIFIED SET OF TALKING POINTS. </p><p>THAT BOTH MUGABE AND MSIKA MADE THE EFFORT TO OFFER THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR A LENGTHY HISTORY LESSON -ALBEIT A ONE-SIDED ONE - </p><p>INDICATES BOTH THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD AND THEIR BELIEF THAT WE </p><p>DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR APPRECIATE THAT VIEW. IN SPITE OF VP </p><p>MSIKA\'S PROFESSED DESIRE FOR OPEN, FRANK DISCUSSION, THERE DOES </p><p>NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH ROOM FOR ALTERNATIVE POINTS OF VIEW ON HOW </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAS COME TO ITS CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS.  RECENT </p><p>MEETINGS WITH VP MSIKA AND OTHER SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS </p><p>INDICATE THE US ACCESS TO THE GOZ HAS IMPROVED FOR THE TIME </p><p>BEING.  THE TOP ZANU-PF LEADERSHIP SEES THIS EXERCISE AS ONE OF </p><p>PERSUADING US NOT TO BE THEIR ENEMIES RATHER THAN LISTENING TO </p><p>WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO AVOID FURTHER DETERIORATION OF </p><p>RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>9. ( C )  ON NOVEMBER 12, THE AMBASSADOR WAS CONVOKED TO PAY A </p><p>COURTESY CALL ON ZIMBABWE\'S OTHER VICE PRESIDENT, SIMON </p><p>MUZENDA; SLIGHTLY OLDER THAN VP MSIKA (79 V </p><p>S. 77), SLIGHTLY </p><p>MORE IRRELEVANT, AND EQUALLY LOYAL TO PRESIDENT MUGABE.  THE </p><p>MEETING WAS EVEN LESS SUBSTANTIVE WITH MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION </p><p>DEVOTED TO TELLING MUZENDA WHY THE RHODESIANS\' LABELING OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 07        HARARE  03367  131457Z </p><p>LIBERATION FIGHTERS AS "TERRORISTS" OUGHT NOT INHIBIT THE ZANU- </p><p>PF GOVERNMENT FROM WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT OF THE WAR AGAINST THE </p><p>AL QAEDA TERRORIST NETWORK.  MORE INTERESTING WAS THE FRANK AND </p><p>SOMEWHAT NAIVE.QUESTIONS FROM MUZENDA: "WHY DO YOU AMERICANS </p><p>WANT TO KICK OUT MUGABE?"  WE GAVE THE STANDARD ANSWER THAT IT </p><p>WAS UP TO ZIMBABWEANS TO CHOOSE THEIR LEADERS THROUGH FREE AND </p><p>FAIR ELECTIONS AND MADE THE CASE FOR BROAD OBSERVATION OF </p><p>ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p>@@@OASYS@@@ </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1510 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03367  01 OF 02  131451Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  EPAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /004W </p><p>                  ------------------3D917B  131452Z /38 </p><p>P 131408Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0259 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 003367 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL. 10/31/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR AND VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA DISCUSS </p><p>TERRORISM, </p><p>LAND REFORM, RULE OF LAW, ELECTION OBSERVATION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER BRUCE WHARTON.

IN SPITE OF VP </p><p>MSIKA\'S PROFESSED DESIRE FOR OPEN, FRANK DISCUSSION, THERE DOES </p><p>NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH ROOM FOR ALTERNATIVE POINTS OF VIEW ON HOW </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAS COME TO ITS CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS.  RECENT </p><p>MEETINGS WITH VP MSIKA AND OTHER SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS </p><p>INDICATE THE US ACCESS TO THE GOZ HAS IMPROVED FOR THE TIME </p><p>BEING.  THE TOP ZANU-PF LEADERSHIP SEES THIS EXERCISE AS ONE OF </p><p>PERSUADING US NOT TO BE THEIR ENEMIES RATHER THAN LISTENING TO </p><p>WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO AVOID FURTHER DETERIORATION OF </p><p>RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>9. ( C )  ON NOVEMBER 12, THE AMBASSADOR WAS CONVOKED TO PAY A </p><p>COURTESY CALL ON ZIMBABWE\'S OTHER VICE PRESIDENT, SIMON </p><p>MUZENDA; SLIGHTLY OLDER THAN VP MSIKA (79 V </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03367  02 OF 02  131452Z </p><p>S. 77), SLIGHTLY </p><p>MORE IRRELEVANT, AND EQUALLY LOYAL TO PRESIDENT MUGABE.  THE </p><p>MEETING WAS EVEN LESS SUBSTANTIVE WITH MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION </p><p>DEVOTED TO TELLING MUZENDA WHY THE RHODESIANS\' LABELING OF </p><p>LIBERATION FIGHTERS AS "TERRORISTS" OUGHT NOT INHIBIT THE ZANU- </p><p>PF GOVERNMENT FROM WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT OF THE WAR AGAINST THE </p><p>AL QAEDA TERRORIST NETWORK.  MORE INTERESTING WAS THE FRANK AND </p><p>SOMEWHAT NAIVE.QUESTIONS FROM MUZENDA: "WHY DO YOU AMERICANS </p><p>WANT TO KICK OUT MUGABE?"  WE GAVE THE STANDARD ANSWER THAT IT </p><p>WAS UP TO ZIMBABWEANS TO CHOOSE THEIR LEADERS THROUGH FREE AND </p><p>FAIR ELECTIONS AND MADE THE CASE FOR BROAD OBSERVATION OF </p><p>ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
