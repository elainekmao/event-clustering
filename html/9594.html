<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001858 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/WCI - PROSPER/MILLER, USUN FOR ROSTOW, EUR </p><p>- JONES, EUR/SCE - JONES/GREGORIAN, L/EUR - LAHNE, L/AF - </p><p>GTAFT. INR/WCAD - SPRIGG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 FIVE YEARS AFTER CLOSURE ICTY </p><p>TAGS: BK, HR, KAWC, NL, PHUM, PREL, SR, ICTY, ICTR </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY: DEL PONTE PUSHES BACK;SEEKS MEETING WITH SG </p><p>ANNAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Classified by Clifton M. Johnson, Legal Counselor, Reason </p><p>1.5(d) and 1.6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Summary.  Carla Del Ponte, Chief Prosecutor of the </p><p>International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia </p><p>(ICTY), is seeking an urgent meeting with UN Secretary </p><p>General Annan, perhaps as early as tomorrow,  to take a </p><p>sounding of the extent of his support for her and to lobby </p><p>for her position.  At her request, Senior Adviser Anton </p><p>Nikiforov conveyed to the U.S. and other governments her </p><p>request for greater involvement in the crafting of the </p><p>Security Council resolution,s language relating to the </p><p>completion strategy, defended her leadership of the ICTR, and </p><p>pressed for more explicit language in the draft resolution </p><p>that would give her a stronger basis for limiting future </p><p>indictments.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) Senior Adviser Anton </p><p>Nikiforov requested a meeting with Embassy legal officers to </p><p>convey a message from Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte </p><p>concerning the renewal of her mandate and a related security </p><p>council resolution.  Nikiforov explained that he had been </p><p>asked to brief representatives of various key capitals today, </p><p>had already spoken to the UK and planned to meet with France </p><p>shortly.   Nikiforov explained that there were three key </p><p>issues in play:  the separation of the ICTY/ICTR prosecutor </p><p>position into two positions, the extension of Del Ponte,s </p><p>term for a "limited" period, and language from the Security </p><p>Council in the form of either a Presidential Statement or </p><p>resolution relating to the completion strategy.  Del Ponte </p><p>opposed the first two initiatives, but supported the third. </p><p> </p><p>ICTY/ICTR Chief Prosecutor Position </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  With respect to the creation of a separate ICTR </p><p>prosecutor position, Nikiforov conveyed Del Ponte,s view </p><p>that it was "not reasonable to take this step after ten </p><p>years."  Del Ponte believes that the situation in the ICTR </p><p>has stabilized, that the right people have been found to run </p><p>the prosecutor,s office there (i.e. the new deputy </p><p>prosecutor and chief of prosecutions), and that the new team </p><p>has had visible results.  According to Nikiforov, Del Ponte </p><p>recognizes that for many years the ICTR was adrift but that </p><p>it is now "running smoothly" and there is good coordination </p><p>among its various officials.  She said she was committed "at </p><p>all costs" to finish investigations by 2004 and trials by </p><p>2008.  If a change is made now, it will "create a new </p><p>crisis."  Del Ponte believes that the new deputy and chief of </p><p>prosecutions will leave if ICTY and ICTR functions are split. </p><p> </p><p>Del Ponte to Lobby in NY for Renewal </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Nikiforov advised that Del Ponte was seeking a </p><p>meeting with Secretary General Annan tomorrow, July 23, in </p><p>New York to discuss the full renewal of her mandate.  He and </p><p>other OTP staffers had been tasked with preparing a paper </p><p>that Del Ponte would present to Annan describing her various </p><p>accomplishments in both the ICTY and ICTR.  Based on the </p><p>signal she received from Annan, she might then seek meetings </p><p>with various Security Council members to lobby for her </p><p>renewal.  Nikiforov implied that Del Ponte would take her cue </p><p>from Annan and that the degree to which she pressed back with </p><p>respect to manner in which her mandate was renewed would be </p><p>driven by her perception of his commitment to her.  (Note: </p><p>We understand from other contacts that SG Annan,s Office is </p><p>likely to reject this request and advise her not to travel to </p><p>NY at this time.  End note). </p><p> </p><p>Completion Strategy </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  In Del Ponte,s view, she "created the completion </p><p>strategy."  She understands that draft security council </p><p>language is circulating in New York and wants to be actively </p><p>involved in formulating the language.  (Note.  Based on </p><p>Nikiforov,s knowledge of various details, it appears that </p><p>she has a copy of the U.S. proposed draft.  End note.) </p><p>Nikforov confirmed that Del Ponte is receiving information </p><p>about the negotiations through "secret" calls but said she </p><p>would like to be approached openly for her views.  According </p><p>to Nikforov, Del Ponte would like to see the language </p><p>constraining new indictments of non-senior level officials </p><p>moved from the preambular section to the operative section of </p><p>the resolution. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Nikiforov further advised that Del Ponte believes the </p><p>proposed language is "too vague" and would like to see it as </p><p>firm and explicit as possible.  Nikiforov explained that </p><p>trial and investigative teams will be pressing her to approve </p><p>new indictments and that she will be under pressure to </p><p>forward them for confirmation.  Absent explicit language, </p><p>this would "put the Prosecutor in a difficult situation." </p><p>Pressed to explain what additional detail was desired, </p><p>Nikiforov indicated that the term "leadership" was vague, </p><p>though he also said that such terms were "more appropriately" </p><p>defined by the judges than the Security Council.  Nikiforov </p><p>further reported that in a one-on-one conversation between </p><p>Del Ponte and ICTY President Meron, Meron had told Del Ponte </p><p>that he would not forward any new indictments to judicial </p><p>chambers for confirmation until the UNSC acted on the </p><p>completion strategy.  (Note: Meron confirmed that such a </p><p>meeting had occurred but characterized as "absolutely untrue" </p><p>the statement attributed to him by Del Ponte.  He had instead </p><p>said that if the Security Council acted to limit the scope of </p><p>future indictments to senior leadership cases that he would </p><p>only confirm such indictments.  End note).  Nikiforov summed </p><p>up by saying that if the Security Council passed a detailed </p><p>resolution with clear criteria on appropriate indictments, </p><p>Del Ponte could say, "We did our best, we were ready to do </p><p>more, but the Security Council has the authority and has made </p><p>clear its view." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Nikiforov was placed in the unusual position of </p><p>delivering Del Ponte,s views on "political" matters by the </p><p>absence from the Hague of political adviser Jean-Daniel Ruch. </p><p> Nikiforov has been with the ICTY for a long time and is a </p><p>knowledgeable and skilled professional committed to the </p><p>Tribunal,s mission.  He delivered Del Ponte,s message </p><p>strongly despite the mixed views he has previously expressed </p><p>about her performance.  He noted in passing that Del Ponte </p><p>had asked him to weigh in with Russia and that he had been </p><p>"placed in a difficult position" by his government,s "strong </p><p>support" for the U.S. and UK efforts in New York.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
