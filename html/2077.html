WHAT ALTERNATIVES DOES THE WORLD, MINUS </p><p>   AFGHANISTAN, HAVE EXCEPT TO ATTACK THOSE WHO GIVE </p><p>   PROTECTION, COMFORT AND SUCCOR TO ARCHITECTS OF </p><p>   INTERNATIONAL TERROR? .AN OLD AFRICAN TRUISM SAYS: HE </p><p>   WHO SHELTERS A THIEF DIES WITH THE THIEF.  THAT IS WHAT </p><p>   IS HAPPENING IN AFGHANISTAN.  .THE MODERN WORLD IS BASED </p><p>   ON, FIRST AND FOREMOST, TOLERANCE OF OTHER PEOPLE\'S </p><p>   CULTURE.  AN INTOLERANT CULTURE HAS NO PLACE IN THE </p><p>   UNITED NATIONS CHARTER, OR THE ISLAMIC NATIONS, OR THAT </p><p>   OF THE AFRICAN UNION, OR THAT OF THE ORGANIZATION OF </p><p>   AMERICAN STATES.  IT HAS NO PLACE IN ISLAM, </p><p>   CHRISTIANITY, BUDDHISM, SHAMANISM, SHINTOISM, AND </p><p>   HINDUISM." </p><p> </p><p>2.   UNDER HEADLINE "THE GLOBALIZATION OF TERROR," THE </p><p>   OCTOBER 18 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL </p><p>   GAZETTE" CARRIED THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE BY SHIMON PERES, </p><p>   ISRAEL\'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER OF FOREIGN </p><p>   AFFAIRS: </p><p> </p><p>   "THE ATTACK ON THE TWIN TOWERS AND THE PENTAGON IN THE </p><p>   U.

FROM A WORLD OF </p><p>   ENEMIES (NATIONALISTIC) TO A WORLD OF DANGERS (GLOBAL). </p><p>   GLOBAL DANGER HAS NO BORDERS.  IT CAN STRIKE ANYWHERE </p><p>   AND AT ANY TIME.  UNFETTERED BY HUMAN VALUES, THE </p><p>   ATROCITIES IT PERPETRATES ARE INDISCRIMINATE, LIMITLESS, </p><p>   SLAUGHTERING CIVILIANS AND INNOCENT PEOPLE.  IT </p><p>   DISSEMINATES HORROR, IT IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF </p><p>   PRESENT-DAY SATAN.  THERE IS NO ROOM FOR COMPROMISE </p><p>   BETWEEN EVIL ACTIONS AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR. .DEMOCRACY </p><p>   CANNOT, AND MUST NOT, DIVERT ITSELF OF ITS MORAL VALUES, </p><p>   EVEN IN THE FACE OF SUCH A BITTER WAR. .THE NEW DANGER </p><p>   IS GREAT AND TERRIBLE.

FROM 1776 TO 2001, IT HAS </p><p>   WAGED 11 MAJOR WARS.  THE FIRST WAS THE REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>   WAR AGAINST BRITAIN (1775 - 1781).  THE 11TH IS THE </p><p>   CURRENT WAR AGAINST AFGHANISTAN (2001).  TEN OF THE WARS </p><p>   INVOLVED FOREIGN ENEMIES.  WHY SO MANY WARS?  THE </p><p>   SIMPLEST ANSWER IS: EXPANSIONISM.  A MORE COMPLEX ANSWER </p><p>   IS: EXPANSIONISM AND EMPIRE BUILDING.  BUT 11 SEPTEMBER </p><p>   2001 DISRUPTED THIS FLOW.  ONCE AGAIN WE SEE THE GREAT </p><p>   FEAR ARISING IN AMERICA, AS IN 1950.  THEN, THE METAPHOR </p><p>   FOR THE FEAR WAS \'COMMUNISM.\' NOW IT IS \'TERRORISM.\' </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03123  190531Z </p><p>   THE PRIME TERRORIST IS OSAMA BIN LADEN, HEAD OF A </p><p>   \'TERRORIST ORGANIZATION\' CALLED AL-QAEDA, AND A </p><p>   CHARISMATIC MUSLIM SPIRITUAL LEADER.  .IN GEOPOLITICAL </p><p>   TERMS THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION HAS REPLACED THE EURO- </p><p>   ATLANTIC REGION IN IMPORTANCE FOR AMERICAN INTERESTS." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
