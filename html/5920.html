An </p><p>angry mob attempted to parade the corpse to </p><p>a nearby police command but was dispersed by </p><p>security forces. The disturbance lasted </p><p>approximately two hours before police </p><p>restored order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Although this incident was not </p><p>directed against official U.S. personnel, it </p><p>is reported because it occurred only a few </p><p>kilometers from the site of the New Embassy </p><p>Compound (NEC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.
