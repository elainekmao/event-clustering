<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 002315 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>NEW DELHI FOR A/S LASH FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, CE, USTR, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SCENESETTER FOR THE VISIT OF COMMERCE A/S LASH TO </p><p>SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Executive Summary </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  On behalf of the country team and the entire mission </p><p>community, I extend to you a warm welcome in advance of your </p><p>visit to Sri Lanka.  Your visit comes at an exciting time, </p><p>with the government of Sri Lanka (GSL) making real progress </p><p>toward its twin goals of peace and economic development. </p><p>This is also a time of heightened U.S. engagement with Sri </p><p>Lanka on multiple fronts, including trade and commercial </p><p>matters; your visit, following closely on the successful </p><p>visit of Deputy USTR Jon Huntsman last month, is a strong </p><p>sign of our commitment to greater engagement with GSL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Sri Lanka now faces its best chance for peace in many </p><p>years.  A cease-fire has been in place since December 2001, </p><p>and the government and Tamil Tigers just sat down for a third </p><p>round of face-to-face talks, which are due to continue in the </p><p>coming year.  If GSL and the LTTE do reach a peace </p><p>settlement, its efficacy and durability will depend largely </p><p>on economic factors - specifically the extent to which Sri </p><p>Lanka is able to achieve economic growth island-wide in the </p><p>coming years.  Strong growth will vest all Sri Lankans in </p><p>peace; if growth falters, the government and the peace </p><p>process will be especially vulnerable to domestic political </p><p>pressures. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The U.S. is by far the largest trading partner of this </p><p>trade-dependent nation, consuming nearly 40% of total exports </p><p>in 2001.  It is thus no exaggeration to say that the U.S. </p><p>trade relationship plays a critical part in Sri Lanka\'s quest </p><p>for peace.  The Sri Lankans understand this, and they have </p><p>been vocal about their desire to enter into FTA negotiations </p><p>with us.  We, for our part, see the Trade and Investment </p><p>Framework Agreement (TIFA) signed with GSL in July as a </p><p>platform for enhancing our bilateral trade relationship.  As </p><p>Deputy USTR Huntsman outlined during the first round of TIFA </p><p>meetings here last month, we want to see GSL make real </p><p>progress on economic reform and further opening its markets </p><p>to U.S. goods.  Making these tough choices is the best way to </p><p>strengthen Sri Lanka\'s economy and bolster the chances for </p><p>long-term peace. </p><p> </p><p>4.  I see two main areas where your visit can advance our </p><p>trade interests here. First, your visit can promote U.S. </p><p>exports by focusing the GSL\'s attention on the massive 10:1 </p><p>trade imbalance between our two nations, and by discussing </p><p>specific ways to right it.  Second, you can encourage GSL to </p><p>make the difficult economic reforms necessary to improve the </p><p>investment climate here.  I believe strongly that pursuing </p><p>these goals with vigor will result in big benefits to U.S. </p><p>business, not just in Sri Lanka but in South Asia as a whole. </p><p>End Executive Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Promoting U.S. Exports </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The bilateral trade picture is dominated by a massive 10:1 </p><p>trade imbalance in Sri Lanka\'s favor.  The imbalance is </p><p>mainly due to large Sri Lankan apparel exports to the U.S. </p><p>($1.5 billion in 2001, or nearly 75% of total Sri Lankan </p><p>exports to the U.S.)  Sri Lanka\'s success in apparel </p><p>manufacturing is partly attributable to a favorable deal on </p><p>U.S. quotas, and partly attributable to Sri Lanka\'s success </p><p>in positioning itself as a low-cost, reliable supplier to the </p><p>upper-middle end of the U.S. retail sector (with The Limited, </p><p>Inc., Liz Claiborne and Federated Department stores some of </p><p>the major importers of Sri Lankan apparel).  This success, </p><p>however, has led to an over-dependence on the apparel sector </p><p>for employment and economic growth.  GSL knows it needs to </p><p>diversify its export base; your visit will reinforce the </p><p>message that improving the local investment climate (see </p><p>below) is a necessary first step in achieving this </p><p>diversification. </p><p> </p><p>6.  While the U.S. absorbs nearly 40% of Sri Lankan exports, </p><p>our share of Sri Lankan imports is less than 4%. (Note:  Main </p><p>U.S. exports to Sri Lanka are wheat (35% of the </p><p>total), followed by yarns/fabric and electrical machinery. </p><p>End Note.)  Yet Sri Lanka runs an overall trade deficit of $1 </p><p>billion.  It is importing plenty of goods, just not from the </p><p>U.S.; main sources of Sri Lanka\'s imports are India (10%), </p><p>Hong Kong (8%) and Singapore (7%).  While this trend is due </p><p>in part to stronger commercial and historical links with </p><p>Asia, it is also due to a lack of transparency that </p><p>disadvantages American suppliers. </p><p> </p><p>7.  I have been pushing GSL hard on every bid that comes up </p><p>here, and have made good progress recently with significant </p><p>power deals going the way of AES and General Electric. </p><p>Still, there is a lot of business here yet to be won by U.S. </p><p>companies.  Your visit is an opportunity to put GSL on notice </p><p>that we are keeping score, and that doing more for U.S. </p><p>exports will help the overall trade relationship. Key areas </p><p>where U.S. exports can be competitive are mass transit </p><p>(buses, locomotive engines), power equipment, and textile </p><p>fabric. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Sri Lanka flirted last year with a ban on biotech foods </p><p>that would have set a precedent injurious to our global trade </p><p>interests.  This mission\'s aggressive lobbying, along with a </p><p>strong letter from USTR Zoellick, helped convince GSL to drop </p><p>the ban.  Your visit is an opportunity to press GSL to keep </p><p>its market open to biotech products and especially to steer </p><p>clear of any harmful labeling schemes. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Improving the Investment Climate </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Sri Lanka is eager to lure more U.S. investment to the </p><p>country.  Sri Lanka as a whole is under-invested, and U.S. </p><p>investment here (book value) is a modest $150 million.  The </p><p>ethnic conflict is only partly to blame; the local investment </p><p>climate, while much better than elsewhere in South Asia, is </p><p>far from perfect.  Sri Lanka has the advantage of having </p><p>opened its economy in the late 1970s, earlier than its </p><p>neighbors.  That wave of reforms led to a surge in foreign </p><p>investment (mainly from Asia) and a rise in living standards </p><p>in and around Colombo, where most of the investment was </p><p>focused. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Twenty five years later, in spite of a long-running civil </p><p>war, Sri Lankans enjoy the highest GDP per capita ($850) of </p><p>any nation in the region (except tiny Maldives). </p><p>Now GSL stands on the brink of enacting a second wave of </p><p>economic reforms that have the potential (against a backdrop </p><p>of peace) to lead to unprecedented rates of economic growth. </p><p>GSL has been vocal about what reforms need to take place - </p><p>better protection of intellectual property, further </p><p>privatization, shrinking of the regulatory role of </p><p>government, more employer-friendly labor laws and improved </p><p>transparency.  Yet GSL has taken very little action, </p><p>preferring to move with caution given the government\'s thin </p><p>parliamentary majority and the fragility of the peace </p><p>process.  A downturn in economic growth or increase in </p><p>joblessness - precisely the kind of short-term pain that </p><p>reforms often produce - could leave GSL vulnerable to attack </p><p>from a leftist/socialist party that can sway large numbers of </p><p>voters. </p><p> </p><p>11.  GSL is right to be wary of moving too fast, but at the </p><p>same time it cannot let another year slip by without taking </p><p>steps to improve the investment climate.  Your visit, in the </p><p>context of the TIFA process, can give GSL the encouragement </p><p>it needs to enact reforms decisively.  Once the peace process </p><p>is on solid footing, any delay in these reforms could </p><p>endanger the prospects for foreign investment, and economic </p><p>growth, for the rest of the decade. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Conclusion:  South Asia and the Bigger Picture </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>12.  With just 19 million of South Asia\'s 1.3 billion people, </p><p>Sri Lanka would seem at first glance to form a small part of </p><p>our overall trade interests with the subcontinent. But Sri </p><p>Lanka is capable of playing a catalytic role in opening the </p><p>region up to U.S. exports, and we can help it assume this </p><p>role. </p><p> </p><p>13.  First, Sri Lanka can serve as an attractive entry point </p><p>into South Asia for U.S. companies.  Sri Lanka has an FTA in </p><p>place with India, is currently finalizing one with </p><p>Pakistan and plans to negotiate one with Bangladesh.  These </p><p>agreements are admittedly far from "free," being plagued by </p><p>negative lists and restrictions on both sides.  Yet they have </p><p>the potential to make Sri Lanka into a hub for South Asian </p><p>trade.  The Indo-Lankan FTA, for example, would allow U.S. </p><p>businesses to export products to Sri Lanka and re-export them </p><p>(with local value-addition) to India on preferential duty </p><p>terms.  With import duties into Sri Lanka low and still high </p><p>in other South Asian nations, these agreements mean Sri Lanka </p><p>can act as an attractive gateway to a largely closed South </p><p>Asian market. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Second, Sri Lanka has the potential to act as a model for </p><p>economic reform and open markets in the rest of South Asia. </p><p>For 25 years Sri Lanka has been the region\'s most open </p><p>economy.  Now, especially if it is freed of the ethnic </p><p>conflict that has hobbled growth, Sri Lanka can quickly </p><p>become a force for liberalization in the region.  We have </p><p>seen in East Asia how small, dynamic economies such as Hong </p><p>Kong and Singapore have prodded their larger neighbors toward </p><p>greater economic openness.  South Asia lacks a Hong Kong or </p><p>Singapore; Sri Lanka can assume that role.  Creating </p><p>competition in liberalization in South Asia, with Sri Lanka </p><p>leading the way, would go a long way toward promoting our </p><p>regional trade interests. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
