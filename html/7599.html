<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 LAGOS 000827 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p>TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA ENERGY UPDATE, April 22 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFS:     A: Lagos 731 </p><p>          B: Lagos 568 </p><p>          C: Lagos 499 </p><p>          D: Lagos 677 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This update includes: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Slowly but Surely: Delta Oil Operations Ramp Up </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Between the Lines: Fuel Shortages Continue During </p><p>Elections </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Fits and Starts: NEPA Privatization Continues while </p><p>Power Capacity Expands Amidst Crises and Outages </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Slowly but Surely: Delta Oil Operations Ramp Up </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ChevronTexaco and Shell Oil continue to ramp up </p><p>their crude oil production in the Niger River delta, </p><p>after local ethnic violence forced them to close </p><p>operations in mid-March.  Chevron continues to aim for </p><p>an end of the month production target of 310,000 </p><p>barrels per day (bpd) (reftel A), down from 460,000 bpd </p><p>it produced prior to the closures.  A spokesperson for </p><p>Chevron told Econoff on April 17 that the company is </p><p>producing near 300,000 bpd. Shell Oil publicly stated </p><p>it had been producing 18,000 bpd from its affected </p><p>facilities during the first week of April, and a </p><p>Reuters report indicated that it may soon reach 100,000 </p><p>of the 320,000 bpd shut-in, if it is not already doing </p><p>so.  Shell produced about 460,000 bpd before the </p><p>clashes between Ijaw militants and Itsekiri villagers, </p><p>which ultimately led to the shutting-in of some 800,000 </p><p>bpd from the region for more than 10 days.  Shell </p><p>reportedly has rescheduled its April exports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) </p><p>reports that Nigeria\'s crude oil exports to the United </p><p>States fell from 798,000 barrels per day in January to </p><p>494,000 bpd in February, ranking it as the sixth </p><p>largest source of imported oil to the U.S. for the </p><p>month, behind Mexico, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and </p><p>Venezuela.  While February 2003 exports exceeded last </p><p>year\'s February numbers by some 50,000 bpd, these </p><p>exports occurred prior to the clashes in the Delta, </p><p>which shut in some 40 percent of Nigeria\'s overall </p><p>crude production. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Meanwhile, the delta region appears to have </p><p>remained mostly calm in recent weeks and through the </p><p>first two rounds of national elections.  Acts of </p><p>violence were reported prior to the April 12 National </p><p>Assembly elections, and deaths were reported on April </p><p>13 after a gun battle erupted between militants and the </p><p>military during an attempt to hold delayed elections in </p><p>some Delta State local government areas (LGA).  Prior </p><p>to the elections, President Obasanjo held a meeting </p><p>with a number of Warri area chiefs and traditional </p><p>leaders from different ethnic groups in an attempt to </p><p>restore peace and find a lasting solution to the </p><p>ongoing tension.  No disruption to oil production was </p><p>reported as a result of election-related violence.  The </p><p>Chevron spokesperson told Econoff on April 22 that the </p><p>Escravos area remained quiet through the elections thus </p><p>far, with a presence of about 200 military personnel in </p><p>the area.  Tension may rise with local elections </p><p>scheduled for May 3, as the original flare-up between </p><p>the Ijaw and the Itsekiri was based on disputed </p><p>electoral boundaries for local government </p><p>representation (reftel B).  But, Chevron\'s spokesperson </p><p>believes the group assembled by President Obasanjo is </p><p>making progress toward reaching an accord. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Between the Lines: Fuel Shortages Continue During </p><p>Elections </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) During this historic election period, Nigerians </p><p>are finding themselves waiting in lines, but not just </p><p>at their polling stations.  Fuel queues remain </p><p>commonplace throughout the country, albeit on a more </p><p>sporadic basis than experienced in February and March. </p><p>Reliable and definitive explanations for the ongoing </p><p>shortages are difficult to come by, as various players </p><p>in the downstream industry blame one another, and new </p><p>events continue to overtake GON efforts at resolving </p><p>the situation. </p><p>6. (U) At first, inopportune domestic refinery </p><p>maintenance, combined with the opportunistic diversion </p><p>of gasoline shipments bound for Nigeria to more </p><p>lucrative U.S. and Venezuelan markets, resulted in a </p><p>serious fuel shortage across all of Nigeria (reftel C). </p><p>Because the GON mandates an artificially low pump price </p><p>for fuel products, private marketers withdrew from the </p><p>import business, leaving the Nigerian National </p><p>Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) as the sole importer of </p><p>fuel (reftel D).  NNPC professes that it has now </p><p>brought in enough fuel and is moving it through its </p><p>subsidiary, the Pipelines and Products Marketing </p><p>Company (PPMC), and accuses depot managers and </p><p>marketers of diverting fuel from designated supply </p><p>routes and filling stations to sell on the black market </p><p>to those willing and able to pay higher prices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) In addition, according to a Lagos-based </p><p>financial risk consulting firm, Nigerian drivers, </p><p>sensitive to the ongoing fuel shortage, now generally </p><p>insist on filling their tanks as often as possible, </p><p>compared to a pre-crisis habit of keeping, on average, </p><p>only a third of a tank of gasoline in their cars. </p><p>Financial Derivatives Company reports that this trend </p><p>has pushed up daily demand for gasoline from 19 million </p><p>liters to 32 million.  Furthermore, ongoing trouble in </p><p>the delta region has reduced Nigeria\'s already </p><p>inadequate domestic refinery production and makes it </p><p>even more unpredictable. Just as Chevron brought its </p><p>Escravos terminal back online and started pumping crude </p><p>oil to the refinery in Warri, vandals blew up a supply </p><p>pipeline to the refinery, again halting its production </p><p>and that of the refinery in Kaduna. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Nigerians now face sporadic and unpredictable </p><p>fuel queues.  In Lagos, stations close less often and </p><p>for shorter periods of time than a few weeks ago, but </p><p>consumers must still wait in gasoline lines at least </p><p>several days a week, and black market sellers hawking </p><p>fuel street-side from jerry cans and plastic jugs still </p><p>appear during crunch times.   Embassy Econoff, </p><p>traveling through northern Nigeria to Plateau state </p><p>during the National Assembly elections April 12, </p><p>reported fuel openly being sold in filling stations at </p><p>70 to 120 naira per liter (the government-imposed price </p><p>is 26 naira per liter).  AmConsul Econoff traveling in </p><p>the Southeast through Anambra and northern Delta states </p><p>noted extensive fuel queues during the weekends of both </p><p>the legislative and presidential and gubernatorial </p><p>elections, the latter having taken place April 19.  In </p><p>the Delta State capital of Asaba, cars were simply left </p><p>in place unattended in the roadway from all directions </p><p>approaching gas stations for what appeared to have been </p><p>several days at a time.  Even the drivers of the </p><p>ubiquitous motorbikes used for public transport were </p><p>forced to crowd en masse at fuel stations, sometimes </p><p>leaving their cycles parked at the gates until gas </p><p>would be sold again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) While some of this shut-down may have been due </p><p>to government efforts to limit movement and commerce on </p><p>election day, Econoff\'s driver reported difficulty </p><p>finding fuel along the way from Lagos to Port Harcourt </p><p>two days prior to the legislative elections, and in the </p><p>Asaba-Onitsha area on either side of the Niger River </p><p>during the presidential and gubernatorial elections. </p><p>Most stations were not open the Sundays following each </p><p>election day, and queues formed as early as 6:00 a.m. </p><p>on the Monday after Easter, a Nigerian national </p><p>holiday. One independent fuel station owner in southern </p><p>Anambra state told Econoff that he was forced to sell </p><p>his gasoline at higher than sanctioned prices because, </p><p>since late January, he has been able to buy only black </p><p>market stock from his distribution depot at premium </p><p>prices, and at irregular intervals.  He lamented the </p><p>situation and said he saw no end in sight.  The station </p><p>was closed when Econoff returned to the area two days </p><p>later.  President Obasanjo reportedly stated during a </p><p>presidential debate sponsored by the Nigeria Labour </p><p>Congress on April 16 that the current government-fixed </p><p>pump price of 26 naira per liter of gasoline cannot be </p><p>sustained, but did not propose a specific price </p><p>increase and did not indicate a government commitment </p><p>to one. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Fits and Starts: NEPA Privatization Continues </p><p>While Power Capacity Expands Amidst Crises and Outages </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) In late March, the Bureau of Public Enterprises </p><p>(BPE) announced that the federal government had </p><p>approved the naming and delineation of 18 new companies </p><p>to be derived from the National Electric Power </p><p>Authority (NEPA).  This follows the work of the </p><p>National Council on Privatization (NCP), which in </p><p>August 2002 recommended the creation of six power </p><p>generation business units, 11 distribution units, and </p><p>one transmission unit.  A spokesperson for BPE relesed </p><p>a statement indicating the transmission company is to </p><p>be named Nigerian Electricity Transmission Company </p><p>Limited, and headquartered in Abuja.  Generating </p><p>companies are to be based essentially on current power </p><p>stations, and the distribution companies will cover </p><p>regional areas and population centers generally </p><p>according to existing operations.  It is unclear when </p><p>the sale of these companies will take place.  The </p><p>National Assembly passed an energy reform bill, which </p><p>could clear the way for the sales, but we have seen no </p><p>sign that President Obasanjo will sign the bill before </p><p>it expires. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Meanwhile, the federal government has boasted </p><p>of an increase in power capacity, but many communities </p><p>continue experiencing power outages and load shedding. </p><p>NEPA\'s managing director, Joseph Makoju, reported in a </p><p>newspaper interview that, due to the rehabilitation of </p><p>both thermal and hydro generating units, the company </p><p>now has a power generation capacity of 4,800 megawatts </p><p>(mw), but averages between 3,000 and 3,300 mw of </p><p>output. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Specifically, NEPA and government officials </p><p>report that the Egbin Thermal Power Station on the </p><p>outskirts of Lagos has all six of its turbines </p><p>operational for the first time in ten years. </p><p>Unconfirmed reports put Egbin\'s production at about </p><p>1,600 mw, but recently it produced as little as 600 mw </p><p>when a natural gas line supplying the plant was cut </p><p>during the ethnic crisis in Warri.  Further, the Daily </p><p>Trust newspaper reported that NEPA officials have </p><p>admitted that power interruptions in the Abuja region </p><p>will continue throughout 2003, due to insufficient </p><p>transmission capacity in relation to population growth. </p><p>Work has begun on new transmission lines throughout </p><p>Rivers state, and there appears to be progress on </p><p>expanding power supply in Bayelsa state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Comment. As we have commented time and again in </p><p>recent weeks, all the developments reported here may be </p><p>greatly affected by the ultimate outcome of the current </p><p>elections.  Some analysts expect the pace of </p><p>deregulation and privatization of different facets of </p><p>the energy sector to increase dramatically in a second </p><p>Obasanjo term.  Everyone is waiting to see if peace in </p><p>the Delta will be maintained, and what effect the </p><p>outcome of the elections will have on efforts to build </p><p>sustainable mechanisms to ensure such peace and foster </p><p>further development.  Tough decisions regarding fuel </p><p>import price parity, the scope and nature of </p><p>privatizing state owned enterprises, and the </p><p>intergovernmental distribution of oil revenues were </p><p>delayed pending the nationwide elections.  Now, the </p><p>relative political strength of the winners, and the </p><p>public\'s reaction to their victories, will be our first </p><p>indications of where the Nigerian energy sector is </p><p>headed in the second-half of 2003, and perhaps beyond. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
