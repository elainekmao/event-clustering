<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 JEDDAH 01892 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, EFIN, ECON, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: JEDDAH\'S MERCHANT ELITE: THE ALIREZAS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION:  THE ALIREZAS ARE JEDDAH\'S </p><p>FIRST FAMILY AND AMONG THE MERCHANT ELITE THEY ARE </p><p>CLEARLY PRIMA INTRA PARAS.  AT PUBLIC RECEPTIONS SENIOR </p><p>ALIREZAS ARE DEFERRED TO BY ALL BUT THE AL-SAUD.  WHILE </p><p>PROBABLY NOT THE OLDEST OR RICHEST FAMILY IN JEDDAH, </p><p>THEIR LINEAGE, REPUTATION, CONNECTIONS AND TRADITION OF </p><p>PUBLIC SERVICE GIVE THEM A UNIQUE PLACE IN JEDDAH\'S </p><p>SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE.  THIS POSITION WAS ACQUIRED </p><p>OVER THE PAST 150 YEARS THROUGH A SERIES OF ASTUTE </p><p>ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL MOVES.  THIS CABLE, WHICH </p><p>DESCRIBES SOME OF THESE MOVES, IS BASED ON NUMEROUS </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS INCLUDING A TWO HOUR </p><p>MEETING WITH THE CURRENT HEAD OF THE FAMILY SHAIKH AHMED </p><p>YUSSEF ZAINAL ALIREZA.  A SECOND CABLE WILL FOCUS ON THE </p><p>STRUCTURE OF THE FAMILY\'S COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE ALIREZAS PROUDLY, IF SOMEWHAT UNBELIEVABLY, </p><p>CLAIM DESCENT FROM ONE OF ISLAM\'S GREAT HEROS AMR IBN </p><p>AL-ASS.  AMR WAS A MECCAN NOTABLE WHO BACKED THE PROPHET </p><p>MOHAMMAD, LED ONE OF THE FIRST MUSLIM ARMIES INTO SYRIA </p><p>IN 633 AND IN 639 DIRECTED THE ARAB CONQUEST OF EGYPT </p><p>WHERE HE REMAINED AS GOVERNOR FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS.  IN </p><p>THE 8TH CENTURY ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS MIGRATED TO </p><p>WESTERN IRAN - WHERE THE ALIREZAS REMAINED UNTIL ZAINAL </p><p>ALIREZA RETURNED TO JEDDAH IN THE 1840.  ZAINAL, WHO WAS </p><p>ONLY 12 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, WAS TAKEN IN BY THE ZAHID </p><p>FAMILY WHO HAD ALSO MIGRATED FROM IRAN.  YOUNG ZAINAL WENT </p><p>TO WORK IN THE ZAHID TOBACCO AND CARPET IMPORTING BUSINESS. </p><p>AFTER SEVERAL YEARS, HE BEGAN TO IMPORT CLOTH AND </p><p>FOODSTUFFS ON HIS OWN AND MARRIED ONE OF THE ZAHIDS, THUS </p><p>BEGINING A TRADITION OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES </p><p>WHICH CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ZAINAL WAS THE SECOND OF FOUR SONS AND BY 1860 HE WAS </p><p>DOING WELL ENOUGH TO BRING HIS YOUNGER BROTHERS, ABDULLAH </p><p>AND HUSSEIN, TO JEDDAH.  HE WAS SOME 20-25 YEARS OLDER </p><p>THAN HIS BROTHERS AND TREATED THEM AS SONS.  IN 1880 </p><p>ZAINAL SENT ABDULLAH TO OPEN AN OFFICE IN INDIA SO THE </p><p>FIRM COULD PURCHASE COMMODITIES DIRECTLY FROM PRODUCERS. </p><p>THIS WAS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL MOVES WHICH BEGAN TO </p><p>SEPARATE THE ALIREZAS FROM OTHER JEDDAH MERCHANTS. </p><p>EVENTUALLY, THEY HAD PURCHASING OFFICES IN BOMBAY, </p><p>CALCUTTA AND KARACHI.  EXPERIENCE IN BRITISH INDIA GAVE </p><p>THEM VALUABLE EXPOSURE TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND MODERN </p><p>BUSINESS PRACTICES WHICH THEIR COMPETITORS LACKED.  IN </p><p>1893 THE FIRM SIGNED ITS FIRST FOREIGN CONTRACT AND </p><p>BECAME AGENTS FOR THE BRITISH MOGUL LINE WHICH HAD A </p><p>MONOPOLY ON SUBCONTINENT HAJJ TRAFFIC.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>MAKING THE FAMILY ITS FIRST REAL FORTUNE, THIS CONTRACT </p><p>MOVED THEM FROM THE ROLE OF TRADITIONAL MERCHANT TO THAT </p><p>OF SPONSOR FOR FOREIGN FIRMS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ZAINAL RETIRED IN 1905 AND LIVED ON UNTIL 1927. </p><p>ABDULLAH RETURNED FROM INDIA TO MANAGE THE FIRM WHILE </p><p>ZAINAL\'S SONS KASSEM, MOHAMMAD ALI AND YUSSEF REMAINED IN </p><p>INDIA.  BACK IN JEDDAH ABDULLAH BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>OTTOMAN TOWN COUNCIL.  AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR, SHARIF </p><p>HUSSEIN OF MECCA APPOINTED ABDULLAH GOVERNOR OF JEDDAH. </p><p>IN 1924 WHEN THE FORCES OF ABDULAZIZ AL-SAUD BESIEGED </p><p>JEDDAH, ABDULLAH HELPED PERSUADE SHARIF HUSSEIN TO </p><p>ABDICATE IN FAVOR OF HIS SON ALI.  WHEN THE SITUATION </p><p>CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE, THE LAST HASHIMITE SHARIF FLED </p><p>TO CYPRUS AND ABDULLAH ALIREZA SURRENDERED JEDDAH TO THE </p><p>AL-SAUD.  SEEKING TO REASSURE HIS NEW SUBJECTS THAT </p><p>JEDDAH\'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ORDER WOULD NOT BE </p><p>OVERTURNED, KING ABDULAZIZ ASKED ABDULLAH ALIREZA TO STAY </p><p>ON AS GOVERNOR.  SINCE THE HASHIMITES HAD TAKEN THEIR </p><p>TREASURY WITH THEM, ABDULLAH ALSO LENT THE KING 6,000 </p><p>POUNDS TO MAINTAIN HIS  GOVERNMENT IN THE HIJAZ.  THE </p><p>FAMILY EMERGED FROM THIS EPISODE WITH ITS PRESTIGE </p><p>ENHANCED AND A NEW ROLE TO PLAY AS ADVISORS AND </p><p>FINANCIERS TO KING ABDULAZIZ. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WHEN ABDULLAH DIED IN 1932, MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM </p><p>REVERTED TO THE SONS OF ZAINAL.  KASSEM HAD BEEN ACTIVE </p><p>IN OTTOMAN REFORM POLITICS AND HAD REPRESENTED JEDDAH AT </p><p>THE OTTOMAN PARLIAMENT IN 190B.  HE MARRIED A TURKISH </p><p>WOMEN AND DIED IN ISTAMBUL IN 1927.  MOHAMMAD ALI IS </p><p>REMEMBERED FOR ESTABLISHING JEDDAH\'S FIRST MODERN SCHOOL </p><p>IN 1903.  KNOWN AS THE FALLAH SCHOOL, IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL </p><p>IN MAKING ARABIC, RATHER THAN TURKISH, THE LANGUAGE OF </p><p>INSTRUCTION.  MOHAMMAD ALI FINANCED HIS SCHOOL AND OTHERS </p><p>LIKE IT IN MECCA, BAHRAIN, DUBAI AND BOMBAY WITH PROFITS </p><p>FROM THE PEARL AND JEWELRY BUSINESS HE ESTABLISHED. </p><p>SINCE MOHAMMAD ALI SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN PARIS AND </p><p>BOMBAY, MANAGEMENT OF THE FAMILY\'S JEDDAH BUSINESS FELL </p><p>TO YUSSEF ZAINAL ALIREZA WHO WAS BY THIS TIME NEARLY 50. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WHEN YUSSEF DIED, ABDULLAH\'S SONS MOHAMMAD AND ALI </p><p>TOOK OVER THE FIRM.  MOHAMMAD WAS EDUCATED IN INDIA.  ALI </p><p>WENT TO BERKELEY IN 1940 AND BECOME ONE OF THE FIRST </p><p>SAUDIS TO STUDY IN AMERICA AND RETURN WITH AN AMERICAN </p><p>WIFE.  DURING THE 40S AND FIFTIES THE TWO BROTHERS AGAIN </p><p>DEMONSTRATED THE FAMILY\'S ABILITY TO SPOT OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>AND CAPITALIZE ON THEIR FOREIGN EDUCATION.  THE ALIREZAS </p><p>BECAME THE SAUDI REPRESENTATIVES FOR WESTINGHOUSE, </p><p>GOODYEAR, PEPSI, FORD AND FOR A WHILE GM.  THEY </p><p>EVENTUALLY SOLD THE GM DEALERSHIP TO THE ZAHIDS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MOHAMMAD ABDULLAH AND ALI ABDULLAH WORKED CLOSELY </p><p>WITH PRINCE FAISAL WHILE HE WAS VICEROY TO THE HIJAZ AND </p><p>LATER FOREIGN MINISTER.  ALI BECAME A MINISTER OF STATE </p><p>WITHOUT PORTFOLIO AND EVENTUALLY SAUDI AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>WASHINGTON.  MOHAMMAD MOVED FROM PRESIDENT OF THE JEDDAH </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TO MINISTER OF COMMERCE.  AFTER </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER ABDULLAH SULIMAN, HE WAS THE SECOND </p><p>COMMONER TO EVER HOLD CABINET RANK IN SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p>MOHAMMAD LEFT THE CABINET BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS WITH KING </p><p>ABDULAZIZ\'S YOUNGER BROTHER ABDULLAH BIN ABDULRAHMAN WHO </p><p>WAS A POWER AT COURT DURING THE REIGN OF KING SAUD. </p><p> </p><p>9.  DESPITE HIS PROBLEMS WITH "UNCLE ABBY", MOHAMMAD </p><p>ABDULLAH ALIREZA REMAINED THE LEADER OF JEDDAH\'S </p><p>MERCHANTS AND A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE AL-SAUD WHEN THEY </p><p>WERE THREATENED BY NASSERISM.  IN THE EARLY 60S EGYPTIAN </p><p>PLANES WERE BOMBING SOUTHERN SAUDI ARABIA FROM BASES IN </p><p>YEMEN AND DROPPING ARMS TO TRIBAL DISSIDENTS NORTH OF </p><p>JEDDAH.  CAIRO\'S VOICE OF THE ARABS WAS CALLING FOR A </p><p>POPULAR UPRISING AGAINST THE AL-SAUD.  MOHAMMAD ALIREZA </p><p>COUNTERED THIS PROPAGANDA BY ORGANIZING A MAHRAJAN - THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL GATHERING OF THE TRIBES TO SWEAR LOYALTY TO A </p><p>LEADER.  DURING THIS LARGE DEMONSTRATION HELD IN DOWNTOWN </p><p>JEDDAH MOHAMMAD ABDULLAH ALIREZA REPEATED HIS FATHER\'S </p><p>GESTURE BY HANDING PRINCE FAISAL A GOLD KEY TO THE CITY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THIS WAS ALSO A PERIOD OF INTERNAL TENSION WITHIN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA AS FORCES GATHERED AROUND EITHER KING SAUD </p><p>OR PRINCE FAISAL.  IT WAS SIGNIFICANT THAT FAISAL GOT THE </p><p>KEY TO JEDDAH, SOMETHING HE DID NOT FORGET AFTER SAUD WAS </p><p>FORCED TO ABDICATE.  FURTHERMORE, WHEN FAISAL BECAME KING </p><p>HE DECIDED TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF NASSERISM HEAD ON. </p><p>HE BEGAN TO CREATE THE FIRST MODERN SAUDI ARMY.  HE </p><p>CALLED FOR AN ISLAMIC CONFERENCE WHICH WAS INTENDED TO </p><p>CONFRONT ARAB NATIONALISM WITH ISLAM AND WHICH EVENTUALLY </p><p>LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCE.  HE FUNDED THE ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT </p><p>BANK AND HE SENT MOHAMMAD ABDULLAH ALIREZA TO CAIRO AS </p><p>HIS AMBASSADOR. </p><p> </p><p>11.  MOHAMMAD SPENT SEVEN DIFFICULT YEARS IN EGYPT WHERE </p><p>HE OFTEN FELT THREATENED AND ISOLATED.  ACCORDING TO HIS </p><p>SON, FORMER SAUDI DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ABDULLAH </p><p>ALIREZA, ONE OF THE FEW OFFICIALS WHO WOULD CALL ON HIS </p><p>FATHER WAS THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR LUCIUS BATTLE. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, MOHAMMAD MADE PROGRESS IN NORMALIZING </p><p>SAUDI-EGYPTIAN RELATION, NEGOTIATING THE TREATY OF JEDDAH </p><p>AND ARRANGING THE WITHDRAWL OF EGYPTIAN TROOPS FROM YEMEN </p><p>WHICH THE SAUDIS, NOT SURPRISINGLY, PAID FOR.  AS A </p><p>REWARD FOR HIS LONG SERVICE, MOHAMMAD MOVED ON TO BECOME </p><p>SAUDI AMBASSADOR TO PARIS WHERE HE HAD SPENT PART OF HIS </p><p>YOUTH WORKING IN HIS COUSIN MOHAMMAD ALI\'S JEWELRY </p><p>BUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  AFTER THE DEATH OF ABDULLAH ALIREZA\'S SONS, </p><p>MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS MOVED ON TO THE GRANDSONS OF </p><p>ZAINAL.  SHAIKH AHMED YUSSEF ZAINAL IS THE CURRENT HEAD </p><p>OF THE FAMILY.  NOW NEARLY 70, AHMED IS ONE OF THE LAST </p><p>ALIREZAS TO HAVE SPENT MUCH OF HIS YOUTH IN INDIA WHERE </p><p>AFTER INDEPENDENCE PROHIBITIONS AGAINST FOREIGN OWNERSHIP </p><p>FORCED THE FAMILY TO LIQUIDATE ITS HOLDINGS.  AHMED ALSO </p><p>MADE FREQUENT VISITS TO JERUSALEM DURING THE THIRTIES </p><p>WHERE HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE DIAMOND TRADE AND DEVELOPED </p><p>A DEEP AND OFTEN EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THE PLIGHT OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  WHILE THE FAMILY\'S BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS HAVE </p><p>BECOME VARIED AND COMPLEX, ITS ASTUTE COMBINATION OF </p><p>BUSINESS AND POLITICS HAS REMAINED CONSTANT.  LAST FALL </p><p>AFTER THE INVASION OF KUWAIT, BUT BEFORE OPERATION DESERT </p><p>STORM, THE ALIREZAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO BUILD A 200 </p><p>MILLION DOLLAR SODA ASH PLANT IN SAUDI ARABIA.  THIS WAS </p><p>THEIR FIRST SIGNIFICANT NEW DOMESTIC INVESTMENT IN OVER </p><p>FIVE YEARS.  WHILE THE PROJECT HAD BEEN UNDER </p><p>CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHS, THE TIMING OF ITS ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>WAS INTENDED TO EXPRESS CONFIDENCE IN SAUDI ARABIA\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND FUTURE.  THE ALIREZAS\' OWN LEADERSHIP AND </p><p>FUTURE WILL BE DEALT WITH IN A SECOND CABLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GRIFFIN </p><p></p></div>
