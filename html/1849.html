THIS IS EVEN MORE </p><p>    SO IF ANY OF THEM BELIEVE THE OFFHAND DISMISSAL OF THE </p><p>    BILL BY THE ZIMBABWEAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U. S., SIMBI </p><p>    MUBAKO. . .WHATEVER THE ATTITUDE OF THE POLITICIANS AND </p><p>    DIPLOMATS OF MUBAKO\'S COMPLACENCY, THE FACT REMAINS </p><p>    THAT IF THE BILL IS PASSED BY THE HOUSE OF </p><p>    REPRESENTATIVES NEXT MONTH AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY SIGNED </p><p>    INTO LAW BY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT GEORGE W.

THE </p><p>    CHRISTENING OF THE BILL \'DEMOCRACY\' IS RATHER </p><p>    ABSURD. . .ONE THEN ASKS WHY THERE IS THIS RELENTLESS </p><p>    PRESSURE BY THE RIGHT-WING ELEMENT IN THE U. S. TO </p><p>    DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED ZIMBABWE </p><p>    GOVERNMENT WHILE NOTHING IS SAID ABOUT THE MILITARY </p><p>    GOVERNMENT OF BURUNDI AND RWANDA.  INDEED WHEN IT COMES </p><p>    TO THE PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY INTERNATIONALLY THE U.

SANCTIONS WILL, IN FACT, INVOKE THAT SPIRIT </p><p>    OF NATIONALISM AND UNITE THE COUNTRY IN THEIR BID TO </p><p>    PRESERVE THEIR HARD-WON INDEPENDENCE.  WE ARE IN THE </p><p>    MIDDLE OF THE THIRD CHIMURENGA AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH </p><p>    JESSE HELMS AND THE U. S.

FOR THEM AND THEIR BLACK PROXIES IN </p><p>    ZIMBABWE TO POSTULATE THE USHERING IN OF A PUPPET </p><p>    REGIME THROUGH SANCTIONS IS A MONUMENTAL </p><p>    MISCALCULATION. . . </p><p></p></div>
