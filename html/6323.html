<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001587 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 13: TREASURY U/S OZTRAK </p><p>SAYS DEBT SUSTAINABLE IF REFORMS STAY ON TRACK </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Treasury Undersecretary Faik Oztrak told </p><p>us March 13 that the key to debt sustainability this year is </p><p>economic reform program implementation, not the U.S. package. </p><p> Oztrak is concerned that the new Erdogan government will </p><p>view the U.S. package as "an excuse not to implement the </p><p>reforms."  If so, the effect of the U.S. package will be </p><p>short-lived, per Oztrak.  He sees Turkey finishing the prior </p><p>actions for the Fourth Review by end March.  Meanwhile, the </p><p>Turkish financial markets are beginning to reflect some </p><p>concern with the lack of confirmation that the new GOT is </p><p>planning a second troop resolution.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Start to Worry about Timing of </p><p>Second Resolution </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On the morning of March 13, Turkish financial markets </p><p>began to reflect increasing concerns with the lack of news </p><p>about a hoped-for second U.S. troop deployment resolution. </p><p>Yields on lira-denominated T-bills inched upwards to 58 </p><p>percent compounded (yesterday\'s close was 57.4 percent); lira </p><p>depreciated slightly to TL 1,625,000 to the dollar; the </p><p>Istanbul Stock Exchange slid another 1 percent (third </p><p>straight day of over 1 percent declines).   Lehman Bros </p><p>analyst for Turkey Ediz told us he is recommending investors </p><p>stay out until the GOT\'s intentions on the second resolution </p><p>are clearer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Treasury U/S Oztrak:  The Key is Strong Policies, </p><p>Not the U.S. Package </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In a March 13 meeting, Treasury U/S Oztrak stressed </p><p>to us that "the key is strong implementation of the economic </p><p>reform program, not the U.S. package.  If the government </p><p>treats the U.S. package as an excuse not to implement </p><p>reforms, then the effect of the U.S. funds will be </p><p>short-lived."  Oztrak\'s other points: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  He doesn\'t foresee a problem with debt sustainability </p><p>this year, provided the GOT moves quickly to strongly </p><p>implement the reform program.  The Treasury\'s financing </p><p>assumptions for 2003 - 45 percent average interest rate on TL </p><p>debt; 87 percent debt roll-over rate; 8 month average </p><p>maturity of TL debt - are currently on track.  This interest </p><p>rate path has March rates at 56 percent, declining to the </p><p>lower 50\'s and upper 40\'s in April and May.  The year-end </p><p>interest rate should be 34 percent under this scenario. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Treasury\'s financing assumptions do not take into account </p><p>an "event risk" related to Iraq.  However, Oztrak said he has </p><p>been telling the GOT that the prescription for this event </p><p>risk is the same as the general problem: "showing the </p><p>determination and ability to deliver strong policies." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  On timing of enacting the 2003 budget, a prior action for </p><p>the Fourth Review, it is scheduled to be reported out of the </p><p>Budget Commission on March 16.  He expects the final steps </p><p>(floor debate, full parliamentary vote, signing into law by </p><p>President) to take another ten days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  On timing of other Fourth Review prior actions, Oztrak </p><p>also believes they will be completed by end March.  They are: </p><p> passage of the direct tax reform law through the budget </p><p>commission (but not full parliamentary vote); adoption of </p><p>TEKEL privatization plan by the Higher Privatization Council; </p><p>Council of Ministry decrees to address redundancies in the </p><p>state enterprise (e.g., eliminate the ban on forcibly </p><p>retiring workers before age 50.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The GOT will seek two waivers for the Fourth Review: </p><p>missing the 2002 primary surplus criterion; missing the state </p><p>enterprise job lay-off criterion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  On the GOT\'s disagreement with the World Bank over </p><p>delaying direct income support (DIS) payments for farmers in </p><p>2003, Oztrak said the Bank is wrong to hurry this program </p><p>into early implementation before all farmers\' land holdings </p><p>had been registered.  (Note: Despite Oztrak\'s criticism, </p><p>World Bank sources told us they reached agreement with the </p><p>GOT overnight to add back into the budget nearly TL 1 </p><p>quadrillion in DIS payments for this year, and instead to </p><p>further cut the public investment budget for state </p><p>enterprises.  To be effective, this agreement must be </p><p>reflected in an amended budget before the bill gets reported </p><p>out of Commission on March 16, per the Bank. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  On an impending cabinet reshuffle, Oztrak said he didn\'t </p><p>know when or who.  MinState Babacan is a "good asset" in the </p><p>Cabinet, since he and PM Gul are among the minority arguing </p><p>for the reform program.  Most ministers don\'t understand the </p><p>program and see it as IMF and WB imposing conditions on </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Strong economic policy management in Turkey requires </p><p>three agencies to be related to one minister - Treasury, </p><p>State Planning Organization, and Central Bank (the last, </p><p>while independent, reports to the Council of Ministers via a </p><p>minister).  To ensure coordination, this minister must also </p><p>be senior to the Finance Minister, preferably a PM or strong </p><p>Deputy PM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The economy overall is not slowing down.  The January </p><p>industrial production figures show IP has reached the highest </p><p>level of the last five years (in 1997).  But external demand </p><p>is still driving growth, which means provinces with export </p><p>industries are doing well while more remote and rural areas </p><p>are still sluggish. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
