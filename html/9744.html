<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001918 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB and EAP/BCLTV </p><p>STATE PASS USTR BRYAN </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USAID FOR ANE/DEL MCCLUSKY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4431/MAC/AP/OPB/VLC/HPPHO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ETRD, ECON, VM, BTA </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. JOINT VENTURE DISPUTE IN DAK LAK PROVINCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HANOI 1826 </p><p> </p><p>     B) 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 1260 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary.  On July 24, Ambassador met with the </p><p>Director of the Dak Lak Provincial Department of Planning </p><p>and Investment (DPI) to discuss a joint venture dispute </p><p>involving an American company, McCullagh International.  Nhu </p><p>admitted that the case could have a "negative impact on </p><p>business investment," but expressed a hope that a buyout </p><p>would resolve matters by end of the third quarter.  However, </p><p>in a separate July 23 meeting, the assertion by the </p><p>province\'s People\'s Committee chairman that the venture\'s </p><p>equipment was "outdated" and "must be thrown away" could </p><p>presage a U.S. investor facing less than equitable </p><p>compensation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Ambassador raised the issue of fair dealing for U.S. </p><p>investors with provincial GVN officials during recent travel </p><p>to Vietnam\'s central highlands, specifically citing the </p><p>"McCullagh-Krong Ana" coffee processing joint venture in Dak </p><p>Lak.  DPI Director Do The Nhu recounted the troubled history </p><p>of the joint venture, claiming DPI had refused to approve </p><p>McCullagh\'s earlier offer to buy out partner Krong Ana, </p><p>because Krong Ana had changed plans, subsequently </p><p>establishing a second processing plant that left two </p><p>processing companies in the same area, competing for the </p><p>same limited supply of beans.  Nhu also contended that </p><p>additional "traffic problems" would exist if McCullagh were </p><p>to operate as an independent concern.  According to Nhu, </p><p>both processing plants would be along rural Route 4 south of </p><p>the provincial capital, Buon Me Thuot. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) McCullagh had originally sought to buy out Krong Ana </p><p>in 2001.  With Ambassador\'s personal intervention with </p><p>senior-level GVN officials (ref B), McCullagh received </p><p>approval from Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) for </p><p>the buyout.  Dak Lak authorities, however, refused to </p><p>implement MPI\'s decision.  Nonetheless, during the </p><p>Ambassador\'s call on Nhu, Nhu additionally contended that </p><p>DPI would have approved the McCullagh buyout if McCullagh </p><p>had been willing to relocate to a new area.  He added that </p><p>this solution was now viewed as "too complicated."  (Note: </p><p>It is unclear if this reference was the opinion of one or </p><p>both of the parties and/or of DPI. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Nhu assessed that, given that Krong Ana had </p><p>established independent operations, that DPI had refused to </p><p>approve McCullagh\'s buyout of Krong Ana\'s 40% share, and </p><p>that McCullagh was ready to leave Vietnam, the only probable </p><p>way forward would be for Krong Ana to buy out McCullagh\'s </p><p>60% interest.  Nhu stated that the Provincial Department of </p><p>Finance would complete an audit of the joint venture </p><p>equipment.  When pressed if an independent audit would be </p><p>available, Nhu confirmed that "Yes, if dramatic differences" </p><p>existed between the parties\' valuations. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) In a July 23 meeting, however, provincial People\'s </p><p>Committee Chairman Lang stated that the equipment was worth </p><p>"a couple hundred million Vietnamese Dong." (Note: </p><p>equivalent to under approximately USD 14,000.  McCullagh </p><p>asserts that a buy-out based on its earlier proposal would </p><p>value McCullagh\'s stake at around USD 850,000.  End Note.) </p><p>Lang also stated that the decision to buy out the U.S. </p><p>partner was only made "to be nice" and that the equipment </p><p>could not be used and would have to be "thrown away."  Lang </p><p>further argued that the inferior coffee produced by the such </p><p>equipment would damage the provincial coffee\'s reputation. </p><p>Ambassador reiterated that the issue of a fair valuation had </p><p>been raised previously with MPI Minister Phuc (ref A) and </p><p>that he had received assurances that an MPI officer would be </p><p>sent to Dak Lak to assist in reaching a fair resolution. </p><p>Ambassador reminded Nhu of Minister Phuc\'s pledge to see </p><p>this issue addressed. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Comment:  This case presents elements of bad faith </p><p>on the part of Krong Ana and may implicate collusion by Dak </p><p>Lak\'s DPI.  If nothing more, the DPI has intervened in </p><p>business affairs in an effort to substitute its judgment for </p><p>market forces by determining where coffee processing plants </p><p>should be located, how many plants the local market can </p><p>bear, and even impliedly assessing the market value of </p><p>processing equipment, all in favor of the local state-owned </p><p>enterprise partner in this joint venture.  The effort to </p><p>educate provincial authorities on market principles and </p><p>obligations under international trade agreements, such as </p><p>the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) is a battle </p><p>that has scarcely begun.  This McCullagh-Krong Ana joint </p><p>venture illustrates how joint ventures can go amiss in </p><p>Vietnam, while setting a notorious precedent of local-level </p><p>disregard of ministerial-level directives and policy - </p><p>particularly those related to Vietnam\'s obligations under </p><p>the BTA.  We are discouraged by this latest response from </p><p>the DPI and People\'s Committee, and plan to write MPI </p><p>Minister Phuc again urging MPI to send a representative to </p><p>Dak Lak soonest. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
