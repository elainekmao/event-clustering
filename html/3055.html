<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, PGOV, PHUM, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: RESETTLEMENT ON THE FARMS:  THE REALITY ON THE </p><p>GROUND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> 1. (SBU) Summary: A visit to four farms in a prime </p><p>agricultural area 2 hours from Harare reveals that chaos </p><p>reigns, and productivity by the new settlers hovers barely </p><p>above zero.  There is no rhyme nor reason to the occupations, </p><p>and the newly resettled show little desire or ability to </p><p>carry out even minimal crop production.  Stick huts have been </p><p>built randomly across previously productive fields. </p><p>Settlers\' crops are few in number, haphazardly planted, and </p><p>poorly tended.  White commercial farmers express bewilderment </p><p>at how the rest of the world can stand by and watch their </p><p>deliberate victimization without offering any hope or relief. </p><p> End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On May 23-24, econoff visited several farms in the </p><p>Karoi area, which was once a prime commercial cereal and </p><p>tobacco-growing region.  Of the properties visited, one </p><p>farmer has been run completely off of his property by war </p><p>veterans and settlers, a second has been confined by settlers </p><p>to his homestead but not allowed to conduct any operations, a </p><p>third has had several "settlements" established on his land </p><p>but has been allowed to continue farming part of his </p><p>property, and a fourth has not yet suffered incursions by </p><p>settlers or war veterans.  In Karoi, at least, there appears </p><p>to be little rhyme or reason as to which farms are targeted </p><p>-- there is no differentiation based on political affiliation </p><p>of the landowner, existence of desirable infrastructure, </p><p>resistance to the resettlement scheme by landowners, or even </p><p>apparent suitability for specific crops.  Although the </p><p>drought has doubtless had some effect on the quality of </p><p>crops, the radical difference between the condition of </p><p>settlers\' fields and those of commercial farmers who still </p><p>remain on their land is remarkable.  Even beyond the contrast </p><p>between the levels of actual husbandry, there is no </p><p>indication that any "settlers" in the area have planted -- </p><p>much less reaped -- enough crops to support even their own </p><p>nuclear families until the next harvest. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) One landowner was evicted from his farm in the early </p><p>stages of the land acquisition exercise.  He had initially </p><p>opposed settlement by the occupiers and sustained a serious </p><p>gash across his face from a settler\'s panga -- machete -- </p><p>before being forced to vacate.  Since his departure, his </p><p>20-hectare patch of coffee bushes -- now entering their </p><p>fourth season, which would produce the first productive crop </p><p>-- has been neglected since the farmer has not been allowed </p><p>to return, and his employees have not been allowed to water </p><p>the trees.  The trees, loaded with a bumper crop of beans </p><p>despite the season-long neglect, are dying amid the </p><p>waist-high weeds that are choking the fields.  There are </p><p>currently no plans by anyone to harvest the crop.  One </p><p>conservative estimate is that over $80,000 US -- badly needed </p><p>forex -- is rotting in full sight of those who claim to be </p><p>"land-hungry farmers."  The image is startling, given the GOZ </p><p>rhetoric regarding how the new economy will be driven by the </p><p>newly-settled farmers. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The second farm visited by econoff comprises about </p><p>1100 hectares, of which 400 are arable.  The arable land has </p><p>for years been under a tobacco/maize rotation, while the </p><p>remainder had been stocked, at significant expense, with a </p><p>wide range of game (eland, sable antelope, kudu, giraffe, </p><p>etc.) to support a wildlife/safari operation.  Since last </p><p>year\'s growing season, when the occupiers took up residence, </p><p>the farmer has not been allowed access to any of his land, </p><p>and has been confined to his homestead by the war vets and </p><p>settlers .  Even this sanctuary was breached, when a settler </p><p>demanding easier access to "his" fields battered down the </p><p>farmer\'s front and back gates with repeated blows from a </p><p>tractor.  A quick tour of the property showed numerous </p><p>stick-and-thatch huts thrown up randomly amid formerly </p><p>fertile fields, with the settlers\' crops totalling, at most, </p><p>several acres.  Prime land seized after last year\'s tobacco </p><p>preparation -- i.e., fertilized, plowed, furrowed and </p><p>irrigated -- now lies under a dense, uniform blanket of weeds </p><p>and brush.  The game has been either hunted by poachers or </p><p>left to stray after the settlers cut holes in the game </p><p>fences.  Two giraffe calves, fit for neither sport nor table, </p><p>were killed -- one left to rot next to the farmer\'s driveway </p><p>and the other cut up for meat to feed the poachers\' hunting </p><p>dogs.  The farmer has recently decided to leave his homestead </p><p>and has been moving some of his personal property -- </p><p>including household furniture -- out of the house.  After </p><p>some settlers noticed the furnishings leaving the property, </p><p>the grassland immediately bordering the farmer\'s homestead </p><p>was set ablaze, leaving a wide swath of destruction.  The </p><p>farmer expects his home to be completely looted within a </p><p>matter of hours after his departure.  As an aside, several of </p><p>the settlers approached the farmer in recent weeks to state </p><p>that they had made a mistake trying to grow crops on his </p><p>farm, and asking for the farmer\'s intervention to "pull </p><p>strings" and get them re-located to a better farm.  Rebuffed </p><p>in this request, the settlers then stated that they were </p><p>hungry, since they had harvested no crops, and asked the </p><p>farmer to buy them maize-meal. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The third farmer has been under siege by a </p><p>contingent of settlers and war vets for the past two growing </p><p>seasons.  This farmer, who bought his property in 1992, has </p><p>markedly improved the level of his laborers\' accommodations </p><p>through personal investment, and has supported infrastructure </p><p>developments for all segments of the farming community.  He </p><p>built and staffed a school for laborers\' children and </p><p>upgraded all labor housing to brick buildings with running </p><p>water, fulfilling his promise to provide adequate housing to </p><p>all his labor before he began constructing an upgraded house </p><p>for his own family.  He has purchased milling machinery to </p><p>process sunflower seed oil for the entire community of </p><p>growers and has served as the local fuel delivery point </p><p>person for the Zimbabwe Farmers\' Union.  When the occupation </p><p>began, this farmer\'s initial response was not to give an </p><p>inch.  He experienced a steadily growing level of violence, </p><p>including abuse of his children at all-night "pungwes." The </p><p>farmer and twenty of his laborers later sustained severe </p><p>beatings by a mob of war vets and occupiers last September. </p><p>Since that time, he has decided to make as much use of his </p><p>land as possible in hope of riding the situation out.  The </p><p>farm now supports three separate "villages" of settlers, </p><p>while approximately half of the farm laborers and their </p><p>families have been chased off the land.  The farmer has been </p><p>limited to sometimes random determinations of which fields he </p><p>can use and which would be "settled."  Again, huts have been </p><p>erected haphazardly across some of the most fertile land, </p><p>although crops being grown on these fields cover a mere </p><p>fraction of the land siezed, with the remainder reverting to </p><p>bush.  In one case, the farmer was forced to build a fence </p><p>around a settler\'s weed-choked cotton patch in order for his </p><p>cattle to graze in the rest of the field, since the settler </p><p>accused the farmer of letting his cattle eat the settler\'s </p><p>cotton.  The farmer estimates that last year -- between crop </p><p>losses, forced sale of livestock at the demands of the </p><p>settlers, unproductive fields, and inputs invested in land </p><p>subsequently seized -- his financial losses ran at </p><p>$74,242,000.00 zim dollars (approximately U.S. $185,000). </p><p>While he admits that his output was higher than average -- </p><p>since he double-cropped some fields while pioneering some </p><p>non-traditional methods in others -- his losses for one farm </p><p>in one season can be extrapolated country-wide. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The last farm visited has not been subjected to </p><p>settlement, although it has been listed and de-listed several </p><p>times.  Currently, the farmer rotates tobacco and maize and </p><p>grazes cattle.  Although the farmer did manage to harvest his </p><p>tobacco crop, he has not sold it since the current pricing </p><p>and exchange rate structure do not provide any profit.  The </p><p>farmer has started to prepare his land for next season, and </p><p>has reported that several farmers around his area are doing </p><p>likewise.  However, this prep work is more in the nature of </p><p>an insurance policy.  If the farmers do not prepare seed beds </p><p>now, they will be unable to plant anything in September, even </p><p>if the situation is stabilized.  If the situation remains </p><p>chaotic, however, with no farmer sure if he can reap the crop </p><p>he sows, none of these commercial farmers intend to plant, </p><p>thus depriving Zimbabwe of needed food and forex-generating </p><p>exports. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Econoff\'s conversations with the farmers repeatedly </p><p>elicited requests for help from the USG.  One farmer stated </p><p>that he could not believe that the "free world" could stand </p><p>by and watch while the GOZ destroyed an entire productive </p><p>segment of its population.  He pointed out that a bailout for </p><p>the GOZ\'s de facto theft and irrefutable mismanagement -- </p><p>even if it were to come sometime in the future -- would be </p><p>exponentially more expensive, and help would never reach </p><p>those citizens who are now being deliberatey bankrupted. </p><p>Other farmers insisted that the best way to get any response </p><p>from the GOZ would be to extend existing travel sanctions to </p><p>the children of the ruling elite, many of whom, they allege, </p><p>are attending schools in the US.  In response to econoff\'s </p><p>arguments that a liberal education is a valid way to change </p><p>young minds, they countered that the children of the ruling </p><p>elite, once they get out of Zimbabwe, are highly unlikely </p><p>ever to return.  While escape is a goal of many Zimbabweans, </p><p>it is an option currently unavailable to most of the </p><p>remaining commercial farmers. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Comment:  These snapshots offer a view in microcosm </p><p>of the uncertainties reigning in Zimbabwe today.  On an </p><p>economic level, the message is clear -- the "fast track" </p><p>resettlement has been a disaster that will cause long-term </p><p>food shortfalls and continued economic decline.  On the </p><p>social level, it is clear that the white Zimbabwean </p><p>commercial farmers risk extinction, but it is not clear that </p><p>the resettled black Zimbabwean communal farmers will be </p><p>better off from this process.  The only unaswered question is </p><p>whether the ongoing process will slow or be reversed before </p><p>the damage to Zimbabwe, and its future, is irreparable, or </p><p>if, indeed, the country has already passed the point of no </p><p>return.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
