<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 000245 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ AND THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>"TRANSFER" </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, January 13, are </p><p>highlights of King Abdullah\'s remarks during an </p><p>interview with the Jordan News Agency, in which he </p><p>addressed numerous domestic and international issues. </p><p>In addition to stating that parliamentary elections </p><p>would be held by June 2003, the King warned of the </p><p>negative repercussions of a war on Iraq, stating that </p><p>such a war would complicate finding a solution to the </p><p>Palestinian issue. </p><p> </p><p>             Editorial Commentary on Iraq </p><p> </p><p>-- "Will Saddam go away?" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(01/13):  "Saddam Hussein\'s ousting from power will </p><p>prevent the war.  This is the conclusion of the new </p><p>media and political campaign that is accompanying the </p><p>build-up of armies in the region.  And so, the </p><p>importance of inspections as the conclusive factor for </p><p>whether war will be launched is slowly subsiding.  The </p><p>U.S. Secretary of State was very clear when he said </p><p>that the war is not dependent on inspectors\' reports. </p><p>Placing Saddam\'s ousting as a condition for preventing </p><p>the war is a definite signal that the possible war has </p><p>become the next unavoidable war.  Those who know the </p><p>Iraqi President and who have followed his life and his </p><p>rule know that he his not a person who would accept </p><p>such a decision." </p><p> </p><p>  Editorial Commentary on the Palestinian "Transfer" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Transfer, as an Israeli policy" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (01/13):  "These days, the highway </p><p>between Israel\'s Ben-Gurion Airport and the city of </p><p>Jerusalem is festooned with political placards and </p><p>posters.  One of them says: `transfer means peace and </p><p>security\'.  Such overtly racist slogans are not being </p><p>met with the derision they deserve from the Israeli </p><p>public; neither do the authorities attempt to remove </p><p>them.  `Transfer\' (of native Palestinians out of the </p><p>West Bank and Gaza Strip to neighboring Arab </p><p>countries, chiefly Jordan) has gained respectability; </p><p>it has become the stated policy of Israeli\'s far </p><p>right, while moderates are scared to speak out against </p><p>it.  Yet, Israeli officials must realize that </p><p>`transfer\' is not a practical option; neither is the </p><p>perpetuation of the current state of affairs with the </p><p>Palestinians.  The next Israeli government must act </p><p>radically to break out of the impasse.  In order to do </p><p>that, Israel has three options only: a two-state </p><p>solution, annexation of the West Bank and Gaza; and </p><p>`transfer\'.  Bush has apparently understood how </p><p>difficult a situation this is.  That is why he </p><p>proposed a half solution; he publicly asked the </p><p>Palestinians to replace Arafat, but failed to make a </p><p>similar overt demand of the Israelis regarding Sharon. </p><p>When Bush described Sharon as a `man of peace\', he did </p><p>that half-mockingly.  The American President was </p><p>confident that his listeners were smart enough to </p><p>understand that he meant the exact opposite of what he </p><p>said.  Time is of the essence.  The general election </p><p>is almost upon us and to win, Sharon only needs a few </p><p>more Palestinian attacks inside the Green Line." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
