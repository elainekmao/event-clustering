<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004246 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: EDUCATION MINISTER BLAMES NSC FOR CIRCULAR ON </p><p>ARMENIAN "GENOCIDE" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4196 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Education Minister Celik asserted to us July 3 that </p><p>the National Security Council (NSC) is  responsible for a </p><p>circular urging all fifth- and seventh-graders to write an </p><p>essay arguing that allegations that the Ottomans committed </p><p>genocide against Armenians are "baseless."  The circular was </p><p>issued in April under Celik\'s signature (reftel).  "This is </p><p>what the NSC (under military pressure) wanted,"  Celik said. </p><p>Celik further lamented the fact that the circular was issued </p><p>to Turkey\'s Armenian schools, and that it directed students </p><p>toward a pre-determined conclusion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment: We did not have the opportunity to press </p><p>Celik further on this issue.  Clearly, there is an element of </p><p>blame-shifting at work.  Celik has in the past reflected a </p><p>narrow view on some hot-button ethnic issues: for example, he </p><p>once explained to Embassy officers that Kurdish "really isn\'t </p><p>a language" (a claim vigorously disputed by Kurds in </p><p>attendance).  Nevertheless, he has been a consistent critic </p><p>of the Educational Establishment, and the NSC\'s dominant role </p><p>in appointing members of the Supreme Education Board (YOK), </p><p>which is charged with maintaining the Establishment view in </p><p>educational and related issues.  Indeed, education has long </p><p>been considered to be within the purview of a Turkish State </p><p>that traditionally has abided by an expansive view of </p><p>"national security" -- one that goes far beyond traditional </p><p>security/foreign policy issues.  In this context, his </p><p>comments tend to bolster widespread suspicions (reported </p><p>reftel) that the NSC is working behind the scenes to raise </p><p>the profile of controversial issues like the genocide </p><p>allegations, foment a nationalist backlash and thereby slow </p><p>the reform process. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
