<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 154474 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/20/02 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NAM, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: NAM:  FOCUSING ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 145790 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY NEA A/S MARTIN S. INDYK.  REASON: 1.5 (B) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IT IS LIKELY THAT IRAQ HAS SENT MESSAGES TO ARAB </p><p>CAPITALS IN RECENT DAYS TO ARGUE THAT SANCTIONS SHOULD BE </p><p>LIFTED BECAUSE IT HAS ALLEGEDLY FULFILLED ITS COMMITMENTS </p><p>UNDER UNSC RESOLUTIONS AND DESTROYED PROHIBITED WEAPONS. </p><p>TARIQ AZIZ MADE THIS ARGUMENT TO UNSCOM CHAIRMAN BUTLER ON </p><p>AUGUST 3/4 IN BAGHDAD AND AGAIN ON AUGUST 5 IN A LETTER TO </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL ISSUED </p><p>A PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT, DECLARING THAT IRAQ\'S ACTION TO </p><p>SUSPEND COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM CONTRAVENED RELEVANT </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND THE FEBRUARY 23 MOU. IN </p><p>THE BI-MONTHLY SANCTIONS REVIEW AUGUST 20, THE COUNCIL </p><p>REITERATED THAT IRAQ\'S DECISION TO SUSPEND COOPERATION WITH </p><p>UNSCOM AND THE IAEA WAS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. WE SUSPECT </p><p>THAT IRAQ WILL SEEK TO GAIN ARAB SUPPORT FOR ITS POSITION </p><p>PRIOR TO THE NAM MEETING IN DURBAN AUGUST 29. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)   EMBASSIES KUWAIT, RIYADH, MANAMA AND CAIRO SHOULD </p><p>DELIVER THE FOLLOWING POINTS TO HOST GOVERNMENTS AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  THESE POINTS SUPPLEMENT PREVIOUS DEMARCHES ON </p><p>THE SAME SUBJECT. WE BELIEVE ADDRESSEE COUNTRIES CAN PLAY </p><p>AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENSURING THAT THE NAM AVOIDS ENDORSING </p><p>IRAQ\'S CURRENT CHALLENGE TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND </p><p>AVOIDS ANY INDICATION THAT THE NON-ALIGNED ARE ACTING IN A </p><p>MANNER DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)   IRAQ SHOULD NOT WIN AT THE NAM WHAT IT HAS BEEN </p><p>UNABLE TO WIN AT THE UN: AN ENDORSEMENT OF ITS CLAIM THAT </p><p>IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS.   IRAQ IS NOT IN </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS. THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL AND THE SECRETARY GENERAL HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT </p><p>IN REFUSING TO COOPERATE FURTHER WITH UNSCOM IRAQ HAS </p><p>VIOLATED THE TERMS OF THE MOU WITH THE SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>AND CONTRAVENED THE RESOLUTIONS. MOST RECENTLY, ON AUGUST </p><p>20, THE COUNCIL MET FOR THE 39TH TIME TO REVIEW IRAQ\'S </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH THE RESOLUTIONS AND DETERMINED QUICKLY THAT </p><p>CONDITIONS DO NOT EXIST FOR THE MODIFICATION OF THE </p><p>(SANCTIONS) REGIME. MOREOVER, THE COUNCIL "REITERATED THAT </p><p>THE DECISION BY IRAQ TO SUSPEND COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM AND </p><p>THE IAEA IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. THEY VIEW WITH EXTREME </p><p>CONCERN THE CONTINUING REFUSAL BY THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ TO </p><p>RESCIND ITS DECISION (TO COOPERATE)." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)   IT IS TRUE THAT IRAQ HAS CARRIED OUT SOME </p><p>OBLIGATIONS, AT LEAST PARTIALLY. IT NOT CARRIED OUT </p><p>-OTHERS. THE FOLLOWING IS A SHORT GLOBAL SUMMARY: </p><p> </p><p>OBLIGATION (PER UNSCRS 687, 70V, 715) -- DONE? </p><p> </p><p>FORMAL LEGAL ACCEPTANCE OF KUWAIT -- YES </p><p>DOMESTIC LAWS ENFORCING THESE OBLIGATIONS -- NO </p><p>FULLY DECLARE WEAPONS PROGRAMS: </p><p>- NUCLEAR -- NO </p><p>- MISSILES -- NO </p><p>- CHEMICAL -- NO </p><p>- BIOLOGICAL -- NO </p><p>ALLOW UNCONDITIONAL INSPECTION ACCESS -- NO </p><p>CEASE ANY ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL/MOVE/DESTROY -- NO </p><p>ALLOW UNSCOM AIRCRAFT FLIGHTS W/NO INTERFERENCE -- NO </p><p>RETURN ALL KUWAITI PROPERTY SEIZED BY IRAQ -- NO </p><p>FACILITATE ICRC SEARCH FOR UNACCOUNTED KUWAITIS -- NO </p><p>END SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM -- NO </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT DIFFICULT. THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL CLEARLY ENVISIONED THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S GOVERNMENT </p><p>COULD IMPLEMENT THEM IN JUST A FEW MONTHS.  HE STILL CAN. </p><p>HE JUST HASN\'T DONE IT. IF THERE IS ANY SUBJECT IN ITS </p><p>ENTIRE HISTORY THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS REVIEWED </p><p>THOROUGHLY, REPEATEDLY, AND IN DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ,  IT IS IRAQ\'S WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION. THE COUNCIL HAS CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF IRAQ </p><p>SANCTIONS EVERY 60 DAYS SINCE 1991, EXCEPT FOR A PERIOD </p><p>WHEN IRAQ\'S CEASEFIRE BREACHES LED TO SUSPENSION. THE </p><p>COUNCIL HAS RECEIVED DETAILED WRITTEN UNSCOM & IAEA </p><p>PROGRESS REPORTS AND VERBAL BRIEFINGS AT LEAST EVERY 6 </p><p>MONTHS SINCE 1991.   ON FEBRUARY 23, 1998, THE SYG SIGNED </p><p>THE ANNAN-AZIZ MOU,  IN WHICH "THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ </p><p>FURTHER REITERATES ITS UNDERTAKING TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH </p><p>UNSCOM AND THE IAEA."  UNSCOM PRESENTED IRAQ WITH A WORK </p><p>PLAN TO MAKE PROGRESS IN JUNE AND IN AUGUST, CHAIRMAN </p><p>BUTLER CARRIED WITH HIM AN ACCELERATED WORKPLAN. IRAQ\'S </p><p>RESPONSE WAS TO SUSPEND COOPERATION AND TRY TO ACHIEVE </p><p>THROUGH DECLARATION WHAT IT HAD FAILED TO ACHIEVE IN FACT: </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) CHEMICAL WEAPONS:    DESPITE MAJOR PROGRESS REPORTED </p><p>BY UNSCOM IN ACCOUNTING FOR SCUD MISSILE CHEMICAL WARHEADS, </p><p>THE IRAQIS HAVE TAKEN A GIANT STEP BACKWARD BY CONTINUING </p><p>TO DENY THE WEAPONIZATION OF VX NERVE AGENT. UNSCOM AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS ARE UNANIMOUSLY CONFIDENT OF THE </p><p>SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY OF LABORATORY RESULTS FINDING </p><p>PERSISTENT VX IN FRAGMENTS OF IRAQI SCUD MISSILE WARHEADS. </p><p>MOREOVER, ON JULY 22, 1998, UNSCOM REPORTED IN A LETTER TO </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL THAT IRAQ HAD REFUSED </p><p>TO ALLOW AN UNSCOM CHIEF INSPECTOR TO TAKE, OR EVEN COPY, A </p><p>DOCUMENT FOUND IN IRAQI AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS THAT GAVE AN </p><p>ACCOUNTING OF CHEMICAL MUNITIONS USED DURING THE IRAN-IRAQ </p><p>WAR. THIS DOCUMENT WOULD BE OF GREAT VALUE IN HELPING </p><p>UNSCOM ESTABLISH A TRUE MATERIAL BALANCE  (THAT IS, KNOWN </p><p>IMPORTS/PRODUCTION MINUS KNOWN USE EQUALS WHAT UNSCOM NEEDS </p><p>TO DESTROY) FOR IRAQI CHEMICAL MUNITIONS--A MANDATORY TASK </p><p>FOR UNSCOM. THE IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR BUTLER THAT "IRAQ. WOULD NEVER GIVE IT TO THE </p><p>COMMISION." </p><p> </p><p>7.    (U) BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS:  IN JULY 1998 UNSCOM ASSEMBLED </p><p>YET ANOTHER GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS TO MEET WITH </p><p>IRAQI COUNTERPARTS FOR REVIEW OF IRAQI DECLARATIONS ON THE </p><p>BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM. AGAIN, THE IRAQIS PRESENTED NO </p><p>NEW MATERIAL.  THE EXPERTS THUS FOUND, AGAIN, THAT IRAQ\'S </p><p>DECLARATIONS ARE NOT ADEQUATE FOR CREDIBLE VERIFICATION. </p><p>THIS CONCLUSION COVERED WEAPONS (SCUD MISSILE BW WARHEADS, </p><p>R-400 BW BOMBS, DROP-TANKS TO BE FILLED WITH BW, AND SPRAY </p><p>DEVICES FOR BW), PLUS PRODUCTION OF BW AGENTS (BOTULINUM </p><p>TOXIN, ANTHRAX, AFLATOXIN, AND WHEAT COVER SMUT), AS WELL </p><p>AS BW AGENT GROWTH MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) LONG RANGE MISSILES: UNSCOM EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN </p><p>RICHARD BUTLER REPORTED TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON AUGUST 5 </p><p>THAT UNSCOM AND IRAQ HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE </p><p>ACCOUNTING OF BOTH CBW AND CONVENTIONAL SCUD MISSILE </p><p>WARHEADS, AS WELL AS THE MATERIAL BALANCE OF MAJOR </p><p>COMPONENTS FOR SCUD ENGINE PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, NO </p><p>PROGRESS WAS REPORTED IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE UNIQUE SCUD </p><p>PROPELLANT POSSESSED BY IRAQ, AND THE IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER REFUSES TO ALLOW FURTHER DISCUSSION OF IRAQ\'S </p><p>CONCEALMENT PROGRAM, INCLUDING THE HIDING OF SCUD WARHEADS. </p><p> </p><p>9.    (U) NUCLEAR: ON MAY 14, THE COUNCIL STATED IT WOULD BE </p><p>PREPARED TO TRANSITION THE NUCLEAR FILE TO LONG TERM </p><p>MONITORING, ONCE THE IAEA WAS SATISFIED THAT IRAQ HAD </p><p>ANSWERED OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS APPROPRIATELY. IN THE IAEA\'S </p><p>"INTERIM REPORT" TO THE UNSC ON JULY 29, THE IAEA REPORTED </p><p>THAT IRAQ HAD PROVIDED NO NEW INFORMATION AND THAT IT HAD </p><p>MADE NO PROGRESS.   IRAQ HAD EVEN FAILED TO TAKE SUCH EASY </p><p>MEASURES AS PASSING LEGISLATION PROHIBITING ACTIVITY </p><p>CONTRARY TO UNSCR 687. ON AUGUST 11,  1998,  IAEA DIRECTOR- </p><p>GENERAL ELBARADEL WROTE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL THAT IRAQ\'S AUGUST 5 DECISION TO SUSPEND ITS </p><p>COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM AND THE IAEA "MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE ....... TO INVESTIGATE. REMAINING QUESTIONS AND </p><p>CONCERNS...," AND THAT IRAQ\'S DECISION WILL ALLOW ONLY </p><p>"LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION" OF MONITORING THAT WILL "FALL FAR </p><p>SHORT OF FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OMV PLAN AND RESULT IN </p><p>A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED LEVEL OF ASSURANCE" THAT IRAQ IS </p><p>NOT RENEWING ITS PROGRAMS FOR WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. </p><p>UNTIL IRAQ RESUMES COOPERATION AND SATISFIES THE IAEA\'S </p><p>REQUESTS, IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO DISCUSS TRANSITIONING </p><p>THAT FILE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) UNSCOM: UNSCOM IS AN INDEPENDENT UN AGENCY, </p><p>CREATED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL.   IT REPORTS REGULARLY TO </p><p>THE COUNCIL, AND HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE COUNCIL. </p><p>UNSCOM HAS HAD TWO EXECUTIVE CHAIRMEN: SWEDISH AMBASSADOR </p><p>ROLF EKEUS AND AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR RICHARD BUTLER. THEY </p><p>WERE STRONG, INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMATS BEFORE </p><p>COMING TO UNSCOM, AND THEY\'VE BEEN STRONG, INDEPENDENT </p><p>LEADERS AT UNSCOM. ON AUGUST 5,   IRAQ INFORMED UNSCOM </p><p>CHAIRMAN BUTLER THAT IT WAS CEASING COOPERATION WITH </p><p>UNSCOM\'S DISARMAMENT ACTIVITIES.  THE COUNCIL REACTED, </p><p>CALLING THIS STEP TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.   ON AUGUST 12, </p><p>UNSCOM EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN BUTLER WROTE TO THE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL THAT "IRAQ\'S ACTIONS BRING TO A HALT </p><p>ALL OF THE DISARMAMENT ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION AND </p><p>PLACE LIMITATIONS ON THE RIGHTS OF THE COMMISSION TO </p><p>CONDUCT ITS MONITORING OPERATIONS." ON AUGUST 18, THE </p><p>COUNCIL PRESIDENT REPLIED ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL, </p><p>REITERATING THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR IAEA AND </p><p>UNSCOM TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THEIR MANDATES AND NOTING THAT </p><p>IRAQ IS OBLIGED TO COOPERATE WITH THEM IN THEIR ACTIVITIES, </p><p>INCLUDING INSPECTIONS. CHAIRMAN BUTLER WROTE TO IRAQI </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AUGUST 19, AGAIN EXPRESSING A </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE COOPERATION, BUT THAT APPROACH WAS </p><p>DECISIVELY REBUFFED BY THE IRAQIS. THE COUNCIL WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO ADDRESS IRAQ\'S UNILATERAL DECISION NOT TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH UNSCOM AND THE IAEA. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) IN SHORT, IRAQ HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE FURTHER </p><p>WITH THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL OR ITS INSTRUMENTS. IN THIS </p><p>SITUATION, WE RECOMMEND THAT THE NAM AVOID ANY STEP THAT </p><p>WOULD INDICATE DAYLIGHT BETWEEN THE POSITION OF THE UN AND </p><p>ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR KUWAIT ONLY: </p><p> </p><p>WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO FIGHT THESE </p><p>IRAQI ATTEMPTS TO CIRCUMVENT THE UNSC BOTH IN CARTAGENA AND </p><p>IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE DURBAN NAM.  YOUR PERIODIC UPDATES TO </p><p>OUR AMBASSADOR AND DAS NEUMANN CONCERNING THE PROGRESS OF </p><p>YOUR EFFORTS HAVE HELPED US CONSIDERABLY IN DETERMINIG OUR </p><p>NAM STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE ON THE MARGINS OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE ITSELF, AND WILL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM </p><p>YOUR DELEGATION THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WE WILL BE USING THE PRECEDING POINTS WITH THE EGYPTIANS, </p><p>BAHRAINIS AND SAUDIS. YOU MAY WISH TO DRAW FROM IT IN YOUR </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH NAM PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>END POINTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
