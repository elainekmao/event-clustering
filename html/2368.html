(C) IN A DECEMBER 20 LUNCH WITH AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN </p><p>AND POLOFF, ZANU-PF MP AND MASVINGO "SUPREMO" EDDISON </p><p>ZVOBGO RUMINATED ON REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION BEFORE </p><p>PARLIAMENT (REPORTED REFTEL), MASVINGO POLITICS, AND THE </p><p>UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  ZVOBGO HAD FEW KIND </p><p>WORDS FOR HIS OLD BROTHER-IN-ARMS MUGABE, SAYING THE </p><p>AGING PRESIDENT DOES NOT LISTEN TO HIM OR ANYONE ELSE </p><p>ANYMORE.  ZVOBGO STATED THAT MUGABE IS BECOMING MORE </p><p>UNPOPULAR ALL THE TIME AND WOULD LOSE THE MARCH </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  "HOW DO YOU CONVINCE VOTERS TO </p><p>VOTE FOR YOU BY BEATING THEM UP?" HE ASKED RHETORICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ZVOBGO INTIMATED THAT ONE OF THE KEY AREAS </p><p>MUGABE WOULD LOSE WOULD BE MASVINGO PROVINCE.  HE HINTED </p><p>THAT HE AND HIS SUPPORTERS WOULD NOT BE CAMPAIGNING FOR </p><p>THE PRESIDENT.  HOWEVER, HE DENIED THAT ZANU-PF SPLITS </p><p>IN MASVINGO WOULD COST MUGABE THE ELECTION, OBJECTING TO </p><p>THE IDEA THAT "FACTIONALISM" IS A PROBLEM IN THE </p><p>PROVINCE.  ZVOBGO DID NOTE THAT VIRTUALLY NO </p><p>KARANGANS (THE SHONA SUBGROUP THAT DOMINATES MASVINGO) </p><p>WERE IN CABINET OR PERMANENT SECRETARY POSITIONS, A FACT </p><p>THAT WILL HURT MUGABE IN THE ELECTION.  "MUGABE WILL </p><p>LOSE THE ELECTION ON HIS OWN," THE MP PREDICTED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) BELYING ZVOBGO\'S CLAIMS, THE JANUARY 3 EDITION </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT-SUPPORTED "ZIMBABWE MIRROR" REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE ZVOBGO FACTION (BACKED BY OUSTED GOVERNOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00061  081040Z </p><p>DZIKAMAI MAVHAIRE AND THE PROVINCIAL WAR VETERANS </p><p>ASSOCIATION) RECENTLY SENT A LETTER TO PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>IMPLORING HIM TO RESOLVE THE ZANU-PF SPLITS IN MASVINGO. </p><p>THE LETTER REPORTEDLY DEMANDED THAT MUGABE REMOVE THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL EXECUTIVE INSTALLED LAST YEAR AND HEADED BY </p><p>HIGHER EDUCATION MINISTER SAMUEL MUMBENGEGWI AND CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNOR JOSIAH HUNGWE (AND BACKED BY VICE-PRESIDENT </p><p>SIMON MUZENDA), OR FACE LOSING THE ELECTION.  THE </p><p>ARTICLE REPORTED THAT THE ZANU-PF TOP BRASS WAS DIVIDED </p><p>OVER HOW TO HANDLE THE ZVOBGO DEMAND. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  AS ZIMBABWE\'S MOST POPULOUS PROVINCE, </p><p>AND ONE NEARLY EVENLY DIVIDED IN SUPPORT FOR THE MDC AND </p><p>ZANU-PF, MASVINGO WILL BE CRUCIAL TO MUGABE\'S CHANCES </p><p>FOR RE-ELECTION.  IF MUGABE CANNOT PLACATE ZVOBGO, WHO </p><p>REMAINS POPULAR IN THE PROVINCE, AND GET HIS BACKING IN </p><p>THE ELECTION, THE PRESIDENT RISKS LOSING A LARGE BLOCK </p><p>OF VOTES.  THE FACTIONAL SPLITS THAT HAVE WRACKED ZANU- </p><p>PF IN MASVINGO FOR YEARS ARE PROBABLY NOT AS GREAT A </p><p>FACTOR FOR MUGABE AS THE PRESS WOULD SUGGEST BECAUSE THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE INSTALLED BY MUGABE AND MUZENDA HAS LITTLE </p><p>PUBLIC SUPPORT.  THE KEY WILL BE CONVINCING ZVOBGO AND </p><p>HIS CADRES TO BACK THE PRESIDENT, AND THAT APPEARS </p><p>INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY AS IT WOULD REQUIRE A HUMILIATING </p><p>ABOUT-FACE BY MUGABE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
