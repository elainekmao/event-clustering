<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN FINANCE AND FOREIGN MINISTERS ON WASHINGTON </p><p>MEETINGS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  The Ambassador called on Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher on November 4 and on Finance Minister Michel Marto on </p><p>November 5 to review their recent meetings in Washington on </p><p>supplemental economic assistance for Jordan.  Confirming the </p><p>informal readouts the embassy has received by email, both </p><p>were very pleased with the way things went.  They said they </p><p>were especially reassured by the serious, senior-level </p><p>attention the United States is giving this issue. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Marto and Muasher both said they completely </p><p>understood the sensitivity of quoting specific figures and </p><p>assured the Ambassador that they will be extremely discrete. </p><p>They also confirmed that they will begin work at once on the </p><p>list of five questions that came out of the meetings.  (Marto </p><p>asked for more clarity on the third question, regarding how </p><p>assistance would be used to help ensure adequate budget </p><p>resources.)  They would be happy to welcome U.S. experts to </p><p>Jordan for further technical work, with a goal of wrapping up </p><p>a package by November 15. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Muasher and Marto said that the financial package </p><p>described by NSA Rice, U/S Larson and others would meet </p><p>Jordan\'s needs.  They said it was their understanding that in </p><p>addition to a supplemental ESF package, the U.S. would </p><p>continue its efforts to assure Jordan\'s access to alternative </p><p>sources of supply if Iraqi oil shipments were cut off. </p><p>Muasher said that, as discussed with A/S Burns, he had tried </p><p>to reach Kuwaiti State Minister Shaikh Muhammad to follow-up </p><p>on their discussions in Amman earlier this month on a </p><p>Kuwaiti-Saudi-UAE oil package.  While he had not yet heard </p><p>back from Shaikh Muhammad, Muasher understood from A/S Burns </p><p>that Saudi Arabia and the UAE appeared to be favorably </p><p>disposed, but he thought an additional high-level </p><p>intervention by the United States would be necessary. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Marto was also very pleased with his meeting with </p><p>U/S Taylor.  He personally welcomed the emphasis on economic </p><p>conditionality he had heard in the meetings at State and </p><p>Treasury, particularly regarding continued performance under </p><p>the IMF stand-by program.  This message, he said, helped him </p><p>maintain the government\'s support for economic reform, </p><p>including pension reform, under the Fund program.  Noting </p><p>that Prime Minister Abul Ragheb had told him that it would be </p><p>politically impossible for the government to raise gasoline </p><p>or diesel prices in the midst of a military conflict, Marto </p><p>said that such conditionality helped his efforts to convince </p><p>the government to eliminate subsidies and meet budget targets </p><p>agreed with the IMF. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
