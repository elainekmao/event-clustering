<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR D, SA, SA/INS, S/CT, SA/PD; NSC FOR E. </p><p>MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  06-11-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, EAID, KPAO, CE, JA, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Despite some Opposition criticism, the Tokyo </p><p>conference continues to generate a positive reaction </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Tokyo 3766 (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Tokyo 3765 (Notal) </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 1008, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Tokyo donors conference continues </p><p>to generate a positive reaction in Sri Lanka.  The </p><p>president maintains a studied silence, however, despite </p><p>some criticism of the conference by her party.  The </p><p>Tamil Tigers, who controversially did not go to Tokyo, </p><p>have also been mum, thus far.  There are reports that </p><p>the Japanese plan to meet with the Tigers soon. </p><p>Overall, there is a very warm glow about Tokyo in Sri </p><p>Lanka, but the Tigers remain a wildcard.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Continued Positive Reaction to Tokyo </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Media reaction in Sri Lanka to the Tokyo </p><p>donors conference generally continues to be very </p><p>positive (except for one key exception -- see </p><p>Paras 3-4).  Local English-language and vernacular </p><p>(Sinhala and Tamil) newspaper coverage focused heavily </p><p>on Prime Minister Wickremesinghe\'s closing remarks, </p><p>which were very laudatory of the international </p><p>community.  The papers also highlighted the "Tokyo </p><p>Declaration on Reconstruction and Development of Sri </p><p>Lanka," which was issued June 10.  The Tamil-language </p><p>press was a bit less upbeat regarding the conference\'s </p><p>outcome, expressing some anxiety as to whether the </p><p>north/east would truly benefit from the understandings </p><p>reached at Tokyo.  Amid the upbeat tone, there was also </p><p>some press to the effect that many of the assistance </p><p>pledges for Sri Lanka were contingent on the peace </p><p>process\'s moving forward.  (Note:  See Ref C for local </p><p>media and political reaction to the first day of the </p><p>June 9-10 conference.  See our media reaction cable for </p><p>a more detailed review of June 11 press play.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>President\'s Party ridicules Tokyo outcome </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The one major area where media coverage struck a </p><p>bit of a down note involved remarks made by the key </p><p>Opposition party.  In June 10 comments that received </p><p>considerable press attention, People\'s Alliance (PA) </p><p>party spokesman Dr. Sarath Amunugama called the USD 4.5 </p><p>billion in pledges made at Tokyo by donors "a huge debt </p><p>trap...We are certainly not approving this mad rush to </p><p>get money."  (Note:  The PA is led by President </p><p>Kumaratunga, who shares a very tense cohabitation </p><p>relationship with the PM and the GSL.)  Among his other </p><p>tart comments, Amunugama went on to assert that the </p><p>majority of the donor funds consisted of loans, not </p><p>grants, for which "the total GDP of this country will </p><p>not be enough to repay the annual installments." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) When asked about Amunugama\'s remarks, </p><p>presidential advisor Eric Fernando -- a bit defensively </p><p>-- told us that it was "the right of the Opposition" to </p><p>criticize the government in power.  Saying that he </p><p>(Fernando) was speaking as a private Sri Lankan citizen, </p><p>however, Fernando added that he was gratified with the </p><p>international community\'s faith in the peace process as </p><p>exemplified by the efforts made at Tokyo. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>President Still Mum </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Despite the fact that her party is piping off, </p><p>President Kumaratunga continues to maintain an almost </p><p>studied silence regarding the Tokyo conference. </p><p>Fernando, the presidential adviser mentioned above, told </p><p>us that he was not sure when or if the president would </p><p>have a direct comment re Tokyo.  Noting that many </p><p>speakers at Tokyo, including the PM and the Deputy </p><p>Secretary, had praised the president, Fernando felt that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>there was little room left for the president to respond. </p><p>Given the president\'s considerable history and </p><p>experience of dealing with the Tigers, however, Fernando </p><p>thought an "I told you so" was the only comment left </p><p>unsaid by Kumaratunga.  (Note:  In saying this, Fernando </p><p>was referring to the fact that the Tigers had </p><p>controversially not attended the conference and have </p><p>been in a difficult mood of late.  The president has </p><p>long been a skeptic toward Tiger involvement in the </p><p>peace process.)  In responding to press reports that the </p><p>president and prime minister plan to meet soon to </p><p>discuss the outcome of the conference, Fernando remarked </p><p>that he anticipated such a meeting, but was not aware of </p><p>a specific timeframe.  (Note:  Per Ref C, the president </p><p>reportedly decided not to meet with Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe before he left for the conference last </p><p>week.  The PM apparently did meet with her key foreign </p><p>policy adviser, Lakshman Kadirgamar, however.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Japanese Reportedly set to Brief the Tigers </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>organization has also not publicly reacted to Tokyo as </p><p>of late June 11.  (Note:  The Tigers usually issue their </p><p>political statements by posting them on "TamilNet." </p><p>While this pro-LTTE website has carried some reports re </p><p>Tokyo, including the full text of the Deputy Secretary\'s </p><p>opening remarks, it has not commented directly on the </p><p>conference.)  There are some press reports, however, </p><p>that the Japanese plan to brief the Tigers on the </p><p>conference\'s outcome.  According to these reports, </p><p>Japanese special envoy Yasushi Akashi plans to travel to </p><p>London for talks with LTTE chief negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham soon.  In the meantime, the Japanese </p><p>ambassador to Sri Lanka is reportedly slated to meet </p><p>with the Tigers in the LTTE-controlled Wanni region in </p><p>northern Sri Lanka.  When asked, Japanese and Norwegian </p><p>Embassy contacts, and the government\'s Peace </p><p>Secretariat, could not confirm these reports. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(Note:  Ref B flagged the possibility of the Japanese </p><p>ambassador\'s visit to the Wanni, however.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Overall, there is a very warm glow about Tokyo </p><p>in Sri Lanka.  Many contacts feel that the conference </p><p>has bolstered the prime minister\'s position back home, </p><p>for example, making it easier for him to move forward on </p><p>the peace track.  All that said, there are real </p><p>questions as to what the Tigers are thinking.  Since </p><p>they pulled out of the peace talks in late April, the </p><p>Tigers have been in a truculent, disruptive mood.  As </p><p>the group digests what happened in Tokyo, it appears the </p><p>LTTE has a real chance to re-engage.  Whether it will </p><p>take that chance, remains very unclear.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
